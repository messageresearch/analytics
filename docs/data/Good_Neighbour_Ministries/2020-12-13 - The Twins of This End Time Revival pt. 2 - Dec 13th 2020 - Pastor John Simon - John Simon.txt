god but lord you knew all about it from before the foundations of the world and we're just happy to be here your prophet said it wasn't him that did the great miracles and things he was just present when you did it and so it is in this hour lord it's not us it's not the bride that is that does the these great things that are happening amongst the bride it's just you doing it and we just happen to be here when you're doing it lord and we're so grateful that you're backing up your word you haven't changed your word you haven't changed one iota and we're we're resting on that lord we're resting on the fact that you are the same yesterday today and forever that you are our healer just as much today even though the focus has changed and has gone to the soul and has gone to the manifestation of a bride but you're still a healer you're still a deliverer you are a waymaker oh god the the way maker and uh we're just happy to be following you lord the songwriter said lead me lord i'll follow anywhere you open up the door and we're glad the doors are open today to come and approach you and to just to ask you to have your way in this service this morning wherever uh it might may uh go

we're together again bob's family [Music] [Music] is praise god hallelujah oh glory to his name the family scattered here and they there but lord we love them there may the family circle never be unbroken praise the lord god bless you please be seated my own dear precious sister just a few years older than i am decided that she will take her flight i i can't say well she decided maybe the lord is ready for her in new york city where she was a registered nurse for many years she grew up there from very young and studied there and practiced there and retired there and finally the lord decided to call her home and he left him in peace and went to be with the lord so we give him all the praise the honor and the glory amen you know i just had a brief moment of sadness because we have siblings but i i marveled even at myself well why i'm not you know really really really broken up and you know like that but and i said what's wrong with me boy am i but the fact is knowing that she's a believer was a a believer of this message for all those years in her heart with the lord i was at peace knowing that she was in the presence of the lord and that she was in a better state than we are because she's free from her prison of bars and of bars of bone and flesh and so on and in the presence of the lord giving him glory we are still here because we have to serve god's purpose and we cannot leave before we finish god's purpose whatever it is you got to finish that before he'll call you home so we give him the praise and the honor and the glory to be here in the house of the lord good to see every single one of you to those who are in the homes that are uh shut in and are watching this uh online broadcast may god richly bless you everyone and uh other letters receiving emails you know various uh groups churches organizations around the world india africa are are emailing me and wanting to come under our covering as they call it our leadership uh so uh if it was of uh that was god's plan then we would be head of several groups around the world but that is not really what god has planned uh my business is just to get the message out and to get the word out and if their elected seat it'll strike that tuning fork within their soul it'll strike something within them and they'll recognize this is different uh this is something that's going not to your flesh uh you know it's not going to your spirit just to make you feel good uh or whatever but it's going right to the soul to bring forth a transforming eternal change amen by the power of god so we give him all the glory for it and i am thrilled beyond measure praise god just to stand here to be able to bring the word of god to you it's a real blessing uh for me to know that praise god and see believers uh their faith in the word walking in line with the word following the word and of come to the place where they're doing it not just because the pastor says so the deacon says so the trustee says so mother says so but they're doing it because they seen something in this world it's caught the attention of the bride class of saints it is caught her eyes and she can't keep her eyes off of isaac she can't keep her heart away from joseph the spirit of the living god is now calling his sheep he is calling the bride is calling them by their name and they are hearing those that have to an ear to hear their hearing and they are just following praise the lord we can't even fully expound or explain put in english what it is we feel within our hearts but we know it's real and we're resting on that we trust and believe what god has sent his servant and prophet to bring the message of the word to us shall we read the scripture before we continue talking as we sense this presence of the holy spirit glory to god and may the presence of god and now the holy spirit go forth amen give the winds a mighty voice glory to god hallelujah genesis chapter 4 verse 12 1 and 2 i mean sorry and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear came and said i've gotten a man from the lord and she again bare his brother abel a gracious god heavenly father we have read from the book and we pray that the great holy spirit will now speak to us for a while and lord thou who are the author of the book we pray you will reveal the book we pray you'll give us understanding give us wisdom and father may we receive it and may you receive all the glory honor and praise today for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and amen god bless you in our last sermon we showed how that from the very beginning of the world that there were twins in the bible in the garden in the womb of eve typical of the church as such cain and abel of course you know the story of cain and abel and of course we recognize these twins were of prophetic significance and uh we find out that there were those twins in the beginning and there are twins now at the time of the end the prophet of this generation has said every revival produces twins amen if that principle remains the same and i believe it is then this revival brought about by his ministry that was stirred up across the world by this god-given ministry fulfilling malachi 4 5 revelation 10 7 making the word of god real to us then it must follow logically sensibly and scripturally that there are twins in this message there are the same twins with the same kinds of characteristics as it was in the garden of eden one of god one born a son of the devil one of truth and one of lies one both religious both wanting to worship god but one doing it by a system of a beaut of beauty a system my friend of of order and stylin and distinction while the other was just seemingly raw and uncooled and out of line and just grab a lamb and take a rock and beat the neck and and the blood flow out and spraying everywhere it seems like there's no order no kind of a gentleman-ness about him just a a country boys got preaching the bible and talking about revelation and bang and hit the lamb and the blood flowed out and oh god wouldn't accept that that's out of order that's not even appropriate it's not even proper it doesn't sound good it doesn't look good it's not photogenic enough it's not produced for tv and hollywood or anything like that all he's talking about and she's talking about is the word of god and the revelation of the word what revelation is that i i don't even know what he's talking about amen praise god hallelujah yes we can use the word revelation casually and you can use it in a deeper sense recognizing it because you have received it you are have open to it and you can see it for the glory of god so every revival produces twins in genesis 25 21 and 24 we find that rebecca produced twins jacob and esau and the bible says they were fighting in the church there were at odds within the womb it looks like child's play you know it didn't look serious because it was just a baby type of play but later on we were going to see how that would ripen when it comes down to the harvest time now the birthright is prominently mentioned in the story of jacob and esau of course esau felt that he had the right to that work right just by the fact of entitlement he had to get it because he was the first son so he didn't have to fight for it he didn't have to strive for it he didn't have to do anything for it because he was going to get it by the right of those laws in that time of entitlement through the laws of work right so he just took it casually that it would automatically fall into his lap as we say it was fall into his lap that way and that's how he took it casually amen so we find out friends that because of that he began to despise the birthright he began to undervalue that but right and then after a while he was ashamed of the birthright my god hallelujah but on the other hand jacob because he knew in the first place it wasn't his right to get it he knew he had to fight for it he knew he had to it doesn't matter what he suffered whether it's hunger what is shame whether his reproach what is mocking what is coughing what is name calling whatever price he had to pay he had to get have that word right amen type of the elected praise the lord hallelujah oh my praise god and when we begin to see the application to our day and time that to every age there was a birthright promise or promise of a new birth through the medium of for instance looter the just shall live by faith that was the only way you could get the birthright promise fulfilled in your life is by being receiving believing and receiving the promise that god made manifest through luther at that time and so on through the messengers down to pentecost where it was accepted and allowed by god that they would speak in towns and perform miracles and have the the the operation of the gifts and that was accepted at that time like the lamb like the blood the natural blood was accepted until the reality comes you see so it was accepted with those original uh old-fashioned pentecostals that took the word of god for that hour but from the time a messenger broke on the scene and the word began to go forth a dispensation changed the word was made manifest praise god brother branham said what a lot of them never realized is that we are not building a house amen we're not building a wall we are here to build a house of the lord he said if you're building a wall you just keep going straight but when you're building a house you have to know how to turn the corner and it takes a good stone mason to know how to put those bricks and turn the corner and a lot of people because they have no revelation they take the written word and say i'm staying with the word that's good but they're going to follow that word straight straight and not recognizing that the word turned the corner but they keep going on like that and then claiming that they're following their word but the word of a past day not the word of this hour not the word of today see and so they're blinded to the very word that they claim they're following hallelujah praise god it came down luther wesley pentecost and now it's the revelation of the word it's the birthright promise of this age the holy spirit comes and tests and tries you to see if that gene or that spirit is in you amen that you will be able to be a receptor of revelation from this world not to inculcate it receive it build up yourself in it by intellectual not by logic not by analysis debate none not by any of those sciences or means of thinking that they school you with that when you approach anything you approach it with that schooling in mind of how you come to it but you you you are as a believer come to this knowing nothing i don't know nothing and this god that is of heaven praise the lord will make himself known to you blessed are you who are eyes amen he has not revealed these things to the wise and the school and the prudent but he's revealed them to babes and sucklings and such as with lord amen glory to god hallelujah amen praise god let's get into the word amen hallelujah so receiving and believing the word the promised word for your age gives you the birth right or the right to be born again hallelujah because it's only by receiving that word for that age your age that you are born again hallelujah glory to god amen oh god is good praise god i i just realized i left all the quotes at home but praise the lord i'll i'll just do the best that god knows everything lord of god i was just about to turn to a coat and realize i don't have them oh praise god amen i'll do the best with what's in me here praise god hallelujah just put your spoon in the pot and whatever comes out you just enjoy it and give god the praise and the honor and the glory amen hallelujah amen praise the lord now we did not know this truth for all these ages because not until this age did god allow the revelation of the mystery of the anointed ones to be made known unto us that a person could have the baptism of the holy ghost every day of their life and still go to hell oh we hear a lot of emphasis on people receiving the baptism the holy ghost but you see we're not talking about the baptism holy ghost just you get it as they got it back down there in recent pentecost 1906 amen you see that's not going to give you this amen you it certainly will give you it'll make you jump shout you'll get healed you'll see signs you'll see wonders you'll be astonished you'll be astounded and it's the truth it's wonderful but it's limited it hasn't caught up to that place where the word itself is your central vision where you look away from everything else and you look to jesus and you see jesus revealed in his own word amen praise god you can have the holy ghost anointing you and you're not born again what an amazing statement when i first heard that got the holy ghost all your life and you could be insane he said another place you could be insane you could be completely out of it you don't know what you're doing but yet you got the holy ghost amen praise god oh my you know when i was just young in the ministry praise god i was preaching with fire and brimstone about the baptism in the holy ghost i was in pentecost and i was just preaching the word 14 years old prostitutes fishermen drunk men businessmen high profile business people principles of high schools and ever were getting converted people were getting healed they were coming with buses from many miles away until the whole town was in revival and the spirit of god was moving in a mighty way oh praise god hallelujah but one day god wanted to take me higher and a good friend we came through high school together and everything else and he sees what god is doing so he said oh pray for me i want to receive the holy ghost amen and we laid hands on him and we're going to pray that the holy ghost will come upon him and all of a sudden hallelujah he shouted he began speaking in towns and everything like that and while he was speaking in towns oh my goodness i can't tell you how i know and the other brother that was with me he can't tell but we both open our eyes from praying and we just happened to look at each other and we didn't have to speak because it's like i knew what he knew and he knew that i knew i saw it too that that was not the holy ghost even though he was speaking in tongues like you wouldn't believe it he was speaking in towns and i realized that's not the holy ghost because inside is spoken said that's not me and so in the name of jesus christ come out of him oh you caught me and then you know i was uh back there and such and i was in france i i was in israel i was in england and i did this this that and then i came down here and met this mother working in the field and the child was under a tree where a certain act took place and i had a right to to possess and take the child as my house and and so on we didn't want i didn't want to hear that we just began to rebuke that devil but the point i am making is that from that moment while i didn't know anything about no messenger no prophet nobody i didn't know i'm new to pentecost i'm young i'm just there but right then it was revealed to me that tongues was not and could not be the the infallible initial evidence of the presence of the holy spirit and so with that understanding of course that start bringing me into conflict with the founders of the denomination and the teachers then you will find out in the early days of the message now after i caught it came in praised the lord we were preaching the word and while we were preaching the word there were trinitarian preachers going out there and having masked miracle ministry revivals people were being healed by the hundreds and the thousands and i would go to those meetings and see those things taking place and we claim we have the word and i know that it used to happen a lot with me it was still happening but on a more limited sense because my focus changed to the world not to the production of miracles and signs and wonders and and these things though it's true and it was there but at that time of course i couldn't understand here's a trinitarian preaching father son and holy ghost three gods in one and all that sort of stuff and still having signs wonders and miracles and ah you're wondering to know how can they do that but after that prophet preached on the anointed ones at their time you could recognize that a man might not even be born again and have the baptism holy ghost down right upon his spirit and still be able to produce things oneness and miracles hallelujah and go on like that and still go to hell because he has reckoned he has not recognized the word of god for his hour still baptizing the people and titles of father son and holy ghost and not realizing the word for his day and for his time and sometimes it's fearful even people in this message that claim they are believers they take it so lightly oh it's a wonderful brother it is like cain is to a bell but he's baptizing in the title of father son and holy ghost but he is holding on to the trinity he is not seeing one god oh my think about it praise god so we're making a a distinction that you could see the difference between these twins because twins usually look so close like a blade of grass and a blade of wheat that when they are very young you can't see or know much of the difference but with maturity then you begin to see a distinction beginning to take place and i believe it's now beginning to happen right within the confines of the message of god for this hour amen yes sir praise god hallelujah oh my that man praying for sick people getting healed and everything else what are you gonna say about that but keep your eyes on the word hallelujah oh praise god amen oh praise god that message if you have the time go back and read it how he pours his reign on the just and on the unjust prophet said when the holy ghost rain falls the true believer says amen glory to god he says and the wheat is just as thirsty and and hot and they're gonna cry praise god hallelujah and jump for joy also but what life is the rain producing in one and what life is it producing in the other one it's what seed of life was buried in there before the foundation of the world that the baptism of the holy ghost manifests and makes real that people can see what was underneath the earth they can't see that until the rain falls on it so when the rain comes on it the thing makes itself manifest and then you're able to recognize what's hiding what nature what character what person is hiding back of that skin veil that dirt ashes to ashes just thus from whence we came it begins to make that known to the people amen praise god hallelujah oh praise god god is here calling out to his genuine elect brother sister he is trying to identify to the entire world or show to the world this bride these believers that they're different hallelujah but notice when god sent a joshua and a caleb he sent them a moses he sent them to moses hallelujah and they were called out what called them out the message of moses something about moses called them out amen but watch not they were not the only one uh you know captured by moses's message there were many others that came out of egypt the same time that came out the bible tells us he had a mixed multitude amen hallelujah they came out together and that mixed multitude we know are the ones that perished within the wilderness because they had to have a time of life and so in the 40-year journey through the wilderness here were the twins walking side by side joshua caleb and the other twins hybrid religion twins mix multitude twins that were walking side by side amen there they were brother sister hallelujah thank god that this little bride of this hour recognizes she can't lead herself and according to malachi 4 5 he promised to send a man that will he'll pour his word through him his spirit through him he'll be the man with the water pot that the holy ghost can pour out of the word for the hour upon the people amen praise god and so god sent a man that could explain or expound some of the mysteries uh to us hallelujah and all she had to do is to show that she had that gene quality in her to receive and understand the word for her day and for her hour coming through the mouth of that messenger praise god to identify her and for her to recognize who she was oh praise his name hallelujah amen oh praise god oh my god don't you understand brother brother branham is dead and god it's not brother branham that leads you to the promised land it's the revelation of the word that takes you to the promised land that takes you into the rapture that takes you into the presence of the lord you're now to be led by what the pillar of fire giving you light giving you power amen that you might walk in the light of the day amen hallelujah praise god here i think i have written here uh oh my god leading his army from victory to victory from revelation to revelation a songwriter says his army shall he lead till every four is vanquished and christ is lord indeed amen hallelujah at the same time god brought moses leading joshua caleb on a mixed multitude out jesus in his day had judas and the rest of his disciples all were following him and the bible tells us have i not chosen you judas was chosen do you realize that he was chosen but one of you is a devil oh my praise god what does he mean by chosen chosen in eternity chosen in time different but the fact is a lying spirit went up before god in the time when ahab wanted to know what to do and said lord choose me send me them let me go down and lie in them prophet's mouth and and god all them different spirit evil spirits asking to be the one and you know whether it's live murder this that but god shows and says okay you lying spirit go down and you go lie in their mouths amen so you see even that lion spirit was chosen for the job that he did amen you see my god it's that way i'm saying that judas was chosen and he was chosen to be the one that will test try prove the word and be right there as a familiar spirit step by step along with the word of god for that hour and praise god so we see judas so god will always give the bride somebody that will lead her amen and that they will pay attention because they'll realize after a while it's not just the man it's just not the man talking that man may talk of himself for for a second whatever he'll talk but then later on they'll realize something happen it's god talking through that man because the words are never failing they're coming to pass and they're way beyond the meaning the opening the revelation is way beyond the words of a man it goes right back into eternity amen that it isn't a man because it's god says so amen praise god hallelujah praise god aren't you happy that we are here by grace we are not here by choosing we are not here because we feel that you know we prayed a little more than somebody else that's why the holy ghost accept us we studied a little bit more we we went into the message a little many more years and whatever we did it's not by works of righteousness which we have done or we are doing though we should do works of righteousness but it is not by works of righteousness it's not by charity it's none by any of these things or human effort but by his grace and by his mercy that he chose us and placed us in his body amen to be one with him and bring him all the glory amen praise god and if you're truly born again you'll receive the promise of this age you'll receive the promise of this age praise god and you'll get into you'll get into the promised land praise the lord the promised land will open right up to you amen hallelujah because you'll enter into the word for this age amen that's what your promise anyway that's our promised land is enter into the word for this age praise the lord hallelujah amen let me let me just give you the quote here uh out of invisible union of the bride so can we be thankful like them pilgrims like abraham who separated ourselves from the things of the world separated ourselves from associates abraham was a pilgrim and the children of abraham are pilgrims many of you don't don't even know that you were pilgrims but i had my pilgrimage come up through not being anything then went to this pentecostal church looking for the truth and move on to this other one searching something in me searching for truth amen and move on to another one into the catholic church of course which was the first one anyway searching for the truth but you had a pilgrimage you come in the message and sometimes you even had a pilgrimage because you're looking for thus saith the lord amen not just said brother simon that the lord said so so so no but you begin to recognize that is thus saith the lord for yourself by revelation hallelujah oh praise god amen god has separated us from all the dead religions amen all your dead creeds into what separated us and has now opened to us a new land a new message for this day hallelujah what is the promised land a new land the message for this day for this hour which is your promised land and it's new to you because you've never seen anything like it before lord of god what is the new land the capstone praise god forevermore that's your new land the revealed word of the hour and you've entered in from written word even just spoken word which is one step higher but you've entered even from just hearing spoken word only and you've entered into the capstone of the presence of the lord hallelujah and in that capstone lies all the promises of god all the promises praise god the promised land the land of promises the land where every promise is fulfilled or can be fulfilled if you believe it oh blessed be the name of the lord you are now living in that capstone if you are a true believer of the living god amen praise god hallelujah and by taking us into that capstone what is he doing by giving us the revelation he is speaking not healing but life into his bride i said he's speaking life into his bride praise the lord jesus that's what you're receiving now is the life of god in you praise the lord amen this is not wesley's time this is not luther's time whatsoever this is not the promise for any other age but this is the whole life of jesus christ oh my you see what i'm saying it's the fullness of god now bodily praise the lord it is the unveiling of the mighty god god and flesh appearing oh glory to god hallelujah god in christ christ in the church the kingdom restoring itself back to what it was in the very beginning it's his life that capstone his life in you is the capstone of your life praise the lord praise god hallelujah and that's what we all have desired and wanted amen praise god hallelujah friends we're coming out we left egypt we come into the promise we come into the wilderness with all kind of trials temptations chess all kinds of snakes and serpents biting poison everywhere tars on the heat whatever everywhere around you but the time has come now where we gotta cross over and go into the promised land we've got to cross jordan amen we've got to get out and recognize out of the seven churches out of pentecost out of all them other days that were there before praise god you're out of the seven day week and you're now into the eighth day by the revelation of the blessed holy spirit lord of god amen crossing the great chasm that adam and eve when they sinned it opened up and separated them between separation between them and god but now jesus christ came back and made himself the bridge of life that we might go back to him back over the other side by crossing on his shoulders across the bridge there'll be no more sorrow across the bridge there's no more pain amen the sun is shining oh my glory to god hallelujah we cross the bridge brother back over the chasm the only person that can lead you back over is the holy spirit himself amen lead you across the chasm so that you can enter the capstone which he called the new land which he called the new message which he called the promised land oh glory to god hallelujah the cross over into it praise god hallelujah amen i tell you friends we thank god that we we sold out everything else to get this revelation let me give you an example here i was following the ministry of a mighty man of god mighty in the message worldwide ministry oh my the world was shaking under the seven thunders and the power of those seven thunders because it was genuine that it really did catch something real and it opened it up for all the rest of us but the fact is i was following that and i was very close to this brother i would be in his home his children would be around me we would be talking we'd be sharing praise the name of the lord i preached in this church when he only had about a hundred people oh my he end up with thousands in the church but the fact is that um he had a meeting here in montreal and i got on a greyhound bus to go up there and i'm in the bus and while i'm in the bus you know the journey is long and so you get kind of sleepy dosy and so i start to kind of slip off and between sleep and wake i heard a voice genesis 1 11 every seed brings forth after its kind whose kind are you going to be one of his or one of mine and you see i'm in that state i'm not thinking i just automatically answer yours lord and when i said that then i said well who am i talking to and i said who am i talking to them like come to myself and i realized that that was the lord talking to me get away from that thing are you going to come out in his image you're going to be after that kind you got to follow the word and then you'll be a seed or come in my image and here i was right at the very top of that movement already taking some of the meetings where the brother couldn't go and then all of a sudden they notice you step back oh my humanly speaking is like it's not logical it's not sanity you're just about to be like really successful and so on and you step right back and even the sister of mine who has gone on for many years oh they start to call me names and everything else you know why why don't you just get there go visit the church and you know they'll they're gonna ask you to preach and all these thousands of people are gonna hear and i said no you don't understand she doesn't know that behind the scenes i went to the brother i didn't tell him my experience but i just said brother i can't follow you anymore right not what you're saying is wrong but i have my own leading and inspiration by the holy spirit that i must follow oh my and that kicked up a racket but you see that's what the true believer has to do you just keep following the word so you can enter into the fullness of your birthright that you could have the right birth amen praise the name of the lord so brother sister that it is what it is today because the revelation is life is that right and without that revelation you're not going in the rapture for the rapture itself is a revelation and without it and the ability given to you to receive revelation and to live by revelation speak by revelation all that you do by the revelation of the holy spirit you'll miss the rapture and you will not be a part of it praise the name of the lord jesus we are not in the pentecostal age anymore how many knows that the church ages are over i don't even need to give you quotes there are so many places that tell you that that the church ages are over and done with then if they're over what did god bring us out just the church is the roof and then you're gonna wander about yes you would if you don't know what's the next step right but praise god he brought us out that he might bring us in that he might bless us is that right praise god i said he brought us out that he might bring us in that he might bless us praise god in the promised land that we have entered him to lord of god hallelujah amen praise god forevermore amen praise god so we find out that a lot of people today are preaching messages for another age and of another age say oh boy but they're preaching a lot of revelation a lot of quotes and everything else like that that's wonderful marvelous and everything else like that praise god hallelujah but you see even brother branham himself many things that he spoke under the understanding of the scriptures that he had at that time were wrong and contrary to the word contrary to the word he himself said so by the way amen but when that those seals got opened and the angel of god the holy spirit began to teach him you know the quotes where he looked up and said oh my god i realized then that charles and ella branham were not my real mother and father in other words they're just mother and father for his flesh but his real mother oh great jehovah hallelujah i'm coming to thee lord he said and from that moment the bible became a new bible oh praise god hallelujah that bible become a new bible he had entered into the new land because the seals opened up and he walked into that new promised land praise god and then he himself began to preach truths that contradicted things that he preached under the first and second pull or in the other ages it began to contradict it you know like love perfect love is the evidence of the holy ghost then another time he says well it's the fruits of the spirit you got to have the entire statue of a perfect man add to your faith this ad and when you get the whole thing then you got the holy ghost you see praise the lord but then he said but when an angel he said yes i i taught those things and i said those things but when an angel come down from heaven and stand up in front of you and said did not our lord say when he the spirit of truth is come what will he do he will guide you into all truth guide you in the world and show you things to come there is the evidence according to the lord himself oh praise god hallelujah all my brothers and sisters and this is where a lot of them get entangled because they take all those things the entire message from a to z and they throw them all together and and they want to take some from here and take some from there and mix it all together and bring it out and don't realize that because of not having a a clear revelation or understanding that they are placing misplaced in the word or dislocating the word of god amen praise god hallelujah oh my so thank god that across the bridge the sun is shining for me today amen it's shining for me today as a songwriter says an old one i just remembered heavenly sunshine heavenly sunshine flooding my soul with the glory divine oh my hallelujah heavenly sunshine shining down and bringing the word to a crystal clear understanding to us amen hallelujah oh glory to god let's go back to these twins amen uh praise god hallelujah let's go back to these twins that we're watching because we've we got to watch these twins and see amen hallelujah that the twins sometimes are some twins you look at them and you could right away you can tell a difference and you know that they're twins that are so close that they could stand right in front of you and you can hardly tell the difference voice looks everything same right oh my goodness because they're twins now we're talking about you're distinguishing now between the twins right you're distinguishing between the 10 twins now you can find the scripture where the bible says but joshua and caleb were of a different spirit they might look the same but one got a different spirit the mother or the father more than likely will know the difference between those ten twins not because of just looks but one has a different spirit one has a different attitude a different approach all together hallelujah different from all the rest of them amen hallelujah so we find out friends here now we come down all the discerning of spirits not just looking on faces and not just talking like that but put in our faith in the word of god amen hallelujah praise god hallelujah oh my so the only way we can differentiate today is by discerning the lord's body being able to discern these enticing and seducing spirits praise god and discernment only comes or is in you by hebrews 4 12. amen for the word of god or the gene in you is quick and sharper than any two-edged sword i don't know how i'm going to know but when it's needed i'm i'm going to know is that right i'm going to know how you're so certain i have faith in him that i will know what i need to know when i need to know it and so i rest amen praise god even if it's taught that oh i got it over him or i deceived him or i fooled him that's fine it's when the end of the race is not losing one battle my friends is the winning of the war praise the lord so so go ahead but i'm gonna rest in him and let him take the glory amen praise the lord so we got to watch this spirit because this spirit is the same spirit that was on judas that is on the people the impersonators the copy cats the liars the one that is the ones that sit close by you and they're marking your mouth they're watching every action and attitude mine amen praise the lord so here it is my brother sister oh my that he was just there trying to uh absolutely uh do that that spirit of judas uh doing that you know and it was satan it's really a satan all the time you know you realize that let me just quickly do this michael and lucifer up in heaven war cane and a bell down in the garden war crow on the dove in the ark and then you go on and jacob and esau fighting and i'm not going to hit everyone let's go over to jesus and then we end up with jesus and judas and then you can go to paul watch the twins there paul is preaching under the same time he said but i want you don't know there is bread brethren sheeps and uh wolf in sheep's clothing they're they're acting like they're sheep but they're ravening wolves right amongst you announce you and i was there in the church right so i want you to be aware the twins are here they're coming down through the ages oh my oh glory to god hallelujah so we must recognize this praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen yes yes sir so he uses judas just the way that he used the serpent right he used the serpent and so he used judas now in that kind of a way praise god i think it's souls in prison now uh page 185 uh whether the scripture says the same quote says same spirits now living in the same kind of people condemn the people see condemned that could never be saved hallelujah what they got the holy ghost but could never be saved what they're speaking in tongues but could never be saved they're doing all these things but they could never be saved yes condemned people condemned he says you see because they were condemned before the foundation of the world like judas iscariot was born a son of perdition yes judas was born a son of hell perdition a son of satan that's what he was born hallelujah just think of it esau sought repentance with tears but he couldn't find it you see he wasn't born according to the word of god he wasn't among god's chosen few praise the name of the lord hallelujah uh you've got to remember judas was religious wasn't he judas was not unbeliever outside running around no he was one that was actually following jesus and he could make claim that he was a christian christians weren't called christians back then but i'm saying that he could make the claim that he was a christian and he was following jesus and was operating the gifts for the bible tells us he went out with the 70 and they were healing the sick cleansing the lepers raising the dead and they come back to jesus you rejoice saying that this happened and jesus turned to them and said oh my rejoice not because you get all those healings and miracles what you need to rejoice about is that your names are written in heaven in other words you're elected you're chosen by god you're elected and your name is in the book but here it was judas was not there whatsoever amen praise the lord and that's one thing about the judah spirit it can't go on with the message it can only go so far and then it has to peel away from it for the seed shall not be air with the shock or turn it the other way the shock shall not be air with the seed amen see praise the name of the lord he can't go on hallelujah he can follow it when you see but when you're teaching oh jesus is a prophet he can follow it through there oh look at the miracles that jesus is doing my look at the breaking of the bread look at the this and that but when jesus got up and started saying i and my father are one i am that jehovah or the old testament now here standing in front of you and i'm proving it that no man could do these miracles except it's god amen oh my he can only go that far and he couldn't swallow it he can only come that far and can't see the word making itself manifest in the bride he can't see the son of man now being revealed he can say it you can talk all them things even what i'm saying he could talk it but to actually have it experientially and to have it in reality that's another matter altogether praise the name of the lord oh my my my lord of god hallelujah i'm not going to keep you forever and ever so um praise the lord hallelujah brother sister what a day we are living in you remember i'm just remembering when when they came back then jesus also told them he says i had joy with you before the foundation of the world if i were to paraphrase i had joy with you but you can't remember and you see you're suffering from spiritual amnesia the shock of sin on the human race you can't remember but i had joy with you before the foundation of the world when the sons of god were shouting for joy and praising god hallelujah they were suffering from spiritual amnesia in every possible way amen so you see friends that spirit of judas couldn't really follow the message all of the way and it will only receive certain things but then it'll start saying oh but you're going too far it's too much the other side amen see because satan has a trick he has a strategy even in this message and this strategy is that he is not mad at you you can preach all you want about all these ages that pass but when you start to preach present truth when you start to preach the word for this hour oh i bring it down more when you start to preach the revelation for this moment amen that the moment you need it it's there that he can't follow he can't understand that because he can't get it it just comes to you and brother branham said you know when god reveals something to you as long as you don't say it the devil is confused he doesn't know what to do and how to act he says just do it and before he can you have done it before he can do anything amen praise god so upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it what rock the rock of supernatural revelation moment to moment to moment a moment to every true genuine believer amen oh my god that because that's why he is the great i am amen the present tense god that's making himself known to his children to his people in this hour and in this time praise the name of the lord oh glory to god hallelujah o praise god no matter how much judas tried to imitate them rest of apostles it only worked out for a while it only worked for a while and it had to come to an end amen praise god that devil in this age now doesn't mind he will encourage anoint and allow those preachers to get a lot to say about the ages that already passed that are behind us and he wants you to keep you out of the message of this day the message this angel mighty angel's message or this last day messenger praise the name of the lord that's what he wants to do keep you there amen praise god and so if he can keep you back there you're trapped in those edges you're trapped in the edges there he is not for anybody trying to bring you out of the wilderness and bring you into the promised land of this capstone message amen don't want you in the present word of the hour where the promises come to their fullness within your life whenever you have need of them and to come to a place where you are living in a contin and consistent state of receiving revelation not that you receive one revelation over here and you study that but that you're living in a stream of consistent and constant revelation that you don't have any control over because the tide goes out and comes in as he wills and you're just resting in his hands isn't that wonderful praise the name of the lord oh my friends oh glory to god hallelujah can i get just let me see if i can get a little more time here just a little more time here uh with you amen praise the lord jesus hallelujah amen amen praise god take enough of the message and then the rest of it you can't stomach you're puking it up you saw all of a sudden you find the prophet's message is wonderful but this part this piece over here can't take it you start to puke it up amen praise god you can take healing let me quote him he says here uh imagine judas could take part of it but the rest of it he could not stomach they can take healing they can take all them other things but when it comes to seeing god speaking squirrels into existence he didn't say i spoke squirrels into existence he said but when it comes for them seeing god speaking squirrels into existence oh my goodness hallelujah think about it my friends and now god's speaking the word and he's creating a bride not squirrels but a bride right in front their eyes and they can't recognize it because i don't see any change i didn't see anything happen oh my it's like brother branham said i just spoke and the next thing there's a squirrel there i he didn't even see or feel or no it just was there and praise god that's what's happening right now with the spoken word with the revealed word that's what it's doing praise the lord jesus and i'm glad i'm a part of it amen hallelujah amen yes sir praise god hallelujah oh my you can have all the written words you want and go to hell you can have the knowledge of the six seals and still go to hell amen but what god wants you to have is a clear crystal clear revelation of him and his word so let me emphasize we are watching spirits we're watching people's spirits we're not just watching their face or anything like that or watching the person because if you look at that a person could be a good person the person could be better morally than you that person could have like brother branham said he said some of the christian signs have more patience than than us sitting here some of them have more love they got those things in them like that but that is not what shows whether or not you have it praise the lord more obligation to their families taking care of their loved ones amen better than a lot of us here praise the lord amen glory to god but one thing we have is a un remitting thirst and hunger for this revelation of the word of the living god amen hallelujah and you know the time is coming some people are going to lay aside these books of this message and start to think i got to make something better of my life right i got to make something better in my life and they want to get rid of the word and the tapes uh that they have and they go out there to get a little more profit a little more gain a better quality of natural life not knowing that that natural life is only for 70 years 100 years and you're weighing that against a life of eternal life for endless endless years to come amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah but friends i tell you and more than that the people that claim they think they're in the bride they might look slow they might look like they're sluggards they may not look good they may not uh have an outward representation amen but i tell you something in their heart god looks at them and he sees a princess he sees a prince with god he sees kings he sees priests when he looks at them because no matter how outside all the mistakes all the jumbled up failures even in that god allowing that to get satan's all muddled well he can't be a christian oh she can't be and maybe that's the very one is that right because god uses all those things just to hide himself behind the scenes that they can't recognize him of who he is oh blessed be the name of the living god hallelujah you got to look sometimes you know we don't we don't act like bride be true to yourself sometimes we we don't act like bride you may catch yourself afterwards and and then come back and and say forgive me lord and like that and so on but sometimes we don't even act like brides and some of those people could go on through their life with a with a control and action and attitude and live in such a way that they look way better than you you can't even class yourself with them but god isn't looking at that he is looking past all that he sees the blood he sees the promise he sees that gene seated in there hallelujah he sees a queen a king a prince with god in there that's what he's looking at amen praise god hallelujah doesn't matter how much hunger how much thirst what you got to suffer but your faith is in the lord and savior jesus christ hallelujah it's jubilee time i said it's jubilee time why because we are now free i don't know if you recognize how free you are but i recognize that i am i've been set free by the grace of god not freedom for folly amen not receiving my liberty as i've often said it over and over to go and perpetrate lawlessness but god has given you that feeling and that spirit to know that you can act move do because he is back of you he is walking with you every step of the way i'm winding this up now here praise the name of the lord he is back of us every step of the way praise god hallelujah we've been resurrected in jesus christ we raised up in jesus christ hallelujah and praise god i know for a fact that i will be but i am now in the resurrection it's going on now when i'm in it and when the whole thing comes to its fullness and it culminates i am still in it praise god but i am in the great marching on the great parade of saints right now while that rapture is taking place and that resurrection has taken place i've been raised up by the word of god hallelujah to see the day in which i'm living in praise god hallelujah oh my praise god and it's not just because my friends i'm better than anybody else but because somehow there happen to be something in me that sees the word in my day look when i go back the holy spirit takes me back like in prayer and said do you remember when you were just a child and they were singing jesus savior pilot me over life's tempestuous sea do you remember when you started crying because you started to see that i am the pilot that was supposed to lead you over all the trials and troubles of your life that was to come and that's the truth i never remembered but all of a sudden he brought it back he said i started to talk to you then lead you and guide you and if some of you will look back in your life you'll see that god was way back he's been talking to you but you don't realize that it was him leading and guiding you out of all kinds of dangers that already tried to come into your life amen praise god hallelujah oh my talk about the evidence of the holy ghost the evidence of the holy ghost my the evidence that the holy ghost was already in you the holy ghost the evidence that that gene was already there praise god hallelujah so friends let's wind this up it's not how good you're living it's not how moral you're living we are supposed to live morally we're supposed to live holy we're supposed to live true but your salvation is not based on that right it is not by works of righteousness that we have done but according to his grace and his mercy that he saved us hallelujah it's by catching every word and holding on to every word by revelation you're going to find somewhere i think it's in the future home where he says look the evidence of the holy ghost is to understand receive and understand the word of god for your age your day and then when you got it go out and live it praise god hallelujah the real evidence of the holy spirit i've seen people speak in tongues run the floors and everything else and two mornings later you realize that no that's not the holy ghost that's that's the devil back there so let's keep our eyes on jesus keep our eyes on the word and stay separate from the things of the world and let him have his way with you praise god so you are born again if you can hear the word of god for your day receive it in your heart and life go out and live it praise the lord say oh brother simon oh my goodness look this is not a new message actually i picked up an old message preach years ago and that's what you're hearing now because this applies to right now in this day and in this hour may god bless every one of you here today and i trust that these few words that i've said to you of course what i've said is expanded even more to me amen so i pray that god will uh nail this down clinch it within your soul that you might go out with a calm assurance for the anointing it's not a whole noise lightning and thunder but he said it's a calm control over the power that you have within you amen that's what it is you're calm you're controlled anointed by the holy spirit amen you don't have to go out there to show any this or that whatever just rest in him and walk with him and let him have his way but mike is coming now and musicians are coming now and we're rejoicing now in the lord who gave his wonderful life for us praise the lord we're preparing as we head down to the christmas season praise the lord and lord already came to me and gave me a message about that how

about that but i already you know have a theme written down and everything else and and here you are telling me the same thing i said all it is that you're being used to confirm to me that this is
