[20:03] scripture becomes more real to you as
[20:06] you
[20:07] progress through it
[20:09] and so we're going to look tonight at
[20:12] how to pray for healing and restoration
[20:14] before we do that let's just go to the
[20:16] lord in prayer amen
[20:18] father we are
[20:21] so grateful tonight lord to be in your
[20:23] presence once again lord because we know
[20:26] that's what makes
[20:28] everything special
[20:30] is that when you
[20:32] promised through your word that where
[20:34] two or three would gather you would be
[20:37] right there in the midst
[20:39] and we find it so
[20:41] privileged tonight lord to know that you
[20:43] are here that you will speak to our
[20:46] hearts you will
[20:49] meet our needs father you know the
[20:51] things that are on our hearts
[20:53] you know how to discern the needs of
[20:54] your people like nobody else
[20:57] and lord we just
[20:58] submit ourselves to you now for service
[21:01] to hear to speak
[21:03] and to recognize and to be able to act
[21:06] upon your word father grant it tonight
[21:08] lord
[21:09] heal
[21:10] restore
[21:12] do a great work
[21:14] in jesus name amen
[21:17] god bless you saints you may be uh well
[21:19] let's read the first scripture
[21:22] go to slide number one the scripture
[21:24] here
[21:24] is from second chronicles
[21:27] chapter 7 verse 14 a very familiar
[21:29] scripture
[21:32] and in this scripture we're going to be
[21:35] looking at the scripture a little deeper
[21:36] tonight and you're going to see things
[21:38] that i'm sure you didn't see before
[21:41] that are going to really strengthen you
[21:43] and and and encourage you
[21:46] and kind of uh vindicate where you are
[21:50] in your walk with the lord in your
[21:52] prayer life amen
[21:54] it says here let's read the scripture if
[21:56] my people who are called by my name will
[21:59] humble themselves and pray
[22:02] and seek my face
[22:04] and turn from their wicked ways
[22:07] then i will hear from heaven and i will
[22:10] forgive their sins and i will heal
[22:14] their land
[22:16] amen you may be seated
[22:19] praise god
[22:22] you know we can look in the world right
[22:23] now and we can see that the world is
[22:25] definitely in need of healing
[22:28] the world is definitely in need of
[22:30] restoration
[22:31] the world is in a condition where
[22:34] you know
[22:35] it's you know even though you look at it
[22:37] economically you might see that you know
[22:39] the stock markets at all-time highs you
[22:41] got you know housing markets at all time
[22:44] highs in the history of the world you've
[22:46] got uh certain economic uh signs that
[22:49] are like showing such prosperity like
[22:52] never before but yet
[22:54] we're in a time and a season where
[22:56] people are so under mental oppression
[23:00] that um
[23:01] division in the world separation in the
[23:04] world
[23:05] wars and rumors of wars and situations
[23:08] worldwide that are taking place all
[23:10] around us so we know that that something
[23:13] is not quite right
[23:15] amen praise god and so
[23:18] we can look at it from that perspective
[23:20] we can see that the world condition and
[23:22] everything else needs healing needs
[23:23] restoration but what about you
[23:26] what about me
[23:28] what about our walks with the lord
[23:30] you know what about our our condition
[23:32] because you know everything around your
[23:35] world starts with your condition and
[23:39] your relationship
[23:41] with the lord
[23:43] it is so important to understand
[23:46] that you know as we
[23:48] move through this 40 days of prayer we
[23:51] don't want to miss the aspect of
[23:54] what
[23:55] you have need of because remember
[23:59] i'm not saying here this is all about
[24:01] you
[24:02] but it is important for you to recognize
[24:04] your place
[24:06] your position
[24:08] in the body of jesus christ and where
[24:10] you have need and where you need healing
[24:14] where you need restoration
[24:16] because you as a human being as long as
[24:18] you're in this human realm you're going
[24:20] to need healing
[24:23] as you grow older
[24:25] you know here in this dimension in this
[24:27] human vessel you're going to feel aches
[24:30] and pains you're going to need to go see
[24:31] the doctor once in a while there's going
[24:33] to be situations that are going to rise
[24:35] up and you're going to wonder oh my
[24:37] goodness am i even going to make it
[24:39] so you know you need healing you need
[24:41] restoration in your own vessel and it's
[24:45] important for you to recognize that over
[24:48] these next 40 days that you know as
[24:50] you're praying
[24:52] focus in on the things that you need
[24:55] healing for
[24:57] and you know
[24:58] restoration you might need a restoration
[25:01] in your
[25:03] in your marriage you might need
[25:04] restoration in your finance you might
[25:07] need restoration in your relationships
[25:09] with with your boss at work or or or
[25:12] your or your teacher at school whatever
[25:15] it might be
[25:16] you know these are things that you can
[25:18] focus in on
[25:20] and and seek the lord
[25:23] in these areas and and see
[25:26] and
[25:27] experience change in your life that's
[25:29] what this is all about saints
[25:32] i hope
[25:33] you're looking for change i hope you're
[25:35] looking for your life to to move on to
[25:38] progress
[25:40] in the lord and to mature
[25:42] and grow up
[25:44] in the lord amen praise god
[25:48] and so
[25:49] um
[25:50] healing
[25:51] is something that
[25:53] is is um
[25:55] so important
[25:57] when you're walking with the lord and
[25:59] when you're walking with one another
[26:02] a lot of times there's division there's
[26:04] things that you need to get fixed
[26:07] between you and
[26:09] someone else
[26:12] i don't know but you know
[26:14] you know where you need restoration
[26:17] where you need healing
[26:18] amen praise god
[26:20] so
[26:21] when we look at this scripture
[26:24] we see here
[26:26] if my people
[26:30] now
[26:31] my people
[26:32] are god's people
[26:35] are sons and daughters of god we've got
[26:37] to recognize
[26:38] who it is that he's talking to
[26:41] he's talking about people who are called
[26:43] by my name
[26:46] you know a lot of people don't want to
[26:47] even be baptized in the name of the lord
[26:49] jesus christ
[26:51] you go and tell them hey you know like
[26:54] if you're going to identify yourself
[26:55] with christ
[26:57] then
[26:58] you know
[26:59] he's your husband
[27:01] he's the bridegroom
[27:03] and you the church are the wife
[27:06] and if you
[27:08] you know call yourself a christian and i
[27:10] come to you and i say hey you need to be
[27:12] baptized
[27:14] in water
[27:15] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[27:18] and you turn around and say yeah well i
[27:20] was baptized i said well how were you
[27:21] baptized well i was baptized i don't
[27:24] know i i got baptized as a baby
[27:27] i said oh
[27:28] well that's that's another thing
[27:31] you need to be baptized as an adult you
[27:34] need to understand what you're doing
[27:36] you need to be able to repent
[27:39] and and turn away from your from your
[27:41] life of sin
[27:42] and then when the baptism takes place
[27:44] you're buried and you're resurrected and
[27:47] you become one with christ and you take
[27:50] his name because now you are identified
[27:53] as his church a christian
[27:56] somebody that's filled with his spirit
[28:00] so
[28:01] you got to be called by his name
[28:04] if you are his people
[28:07] and listen he says and will humble
[28:09] themselves and pray
[28:12] and seek my face
[28:15] we're gonna look a little deeper
[28:17] and turn from their wicked ways
[28:20] you know a lot of people think right
[28:22] away you know wicked ways you know like
[28:24] well i'm not wicked you know i'm not you
[28:26] know
[28:27] you know wickedness is is murder and
[28:29] wickedness is is uh um you know uh
[28:33] stealing
[28:34] from the poor and and wickedness is you
[28:37] know all these things of like you know
[28:39] that people identify wickedness with but
[28:42] we're gonna come to see a little bit
[28:44] deeper really what wickedness is
[28:47] wicked ways
[28:50] then i will hear from heaven
[28:52] and i will forgive your sin
[28:57] and heal your land
[28:59] now let's look at the next
[29:02] scripture here matthew 12
[29:04] 46 to 50
[29:06] while jesus was teaching
[29:08] the crowd his mother and brothers waited
[29:10] nearby to speak to him someone
[29:12] told jesus your family wants to talk to
[29:15] you jesus says who is my family
[29:18] see a lot of people will instantly you
[29:21] know um
[29:22] think that that
[29:24] you know you've got to be uh
[29:27] family
[29:28] you know but jesus made it very clear
[29:31] who his family was
[29:33] his family
[29:34] are those
[29:36] that
[29:38] follow him
[29:39] hear his word
[29:41] recognize his word and obey his word
[29:44] next slide
[29:46] matthew 12 46 then pointing to his
[29:49] followers he said these people are my
[29:51] family
[29:52] anybody who obeys my father in heaven
[29:55] and does his will is my brother my
[29:57] sister and my mother
[30:00] so we come to realize that
[30:03] it's even though jesus had family on
[30:05] earth
[30:08] his family are the sons and daughters of
[30:10] god
[30:11] that are born
[30:13] again by the spirit of god
[30:16] if my people who are called by my name
[30:21] amen
[30:22] and so next slide if anyone is ashamed
[30:25] of me
[30:26] and my words
[30:30] and my words in this unfaithful in and
[30:33] immoral generation i will be ashamed of
[30:36] him when i return in glory with all my
[30:39] angels
[30:41] so the very first thing
[30:44] is to recognize that jesus christ is
[30:46] your lord
[30:47] and that he is your savior and that he
[30:50] is your redeemer and that you need
[30:52] salvation
[30:54] amen praise god without knowing him
[30:58] you cannot know true healing true
[31:01] restoration
[31:03] and true identification with jesus
[31:05] christ
[31:06] next slide
[31:08] so the first thing that we need to admit
[31:12] is that you're not in control
[31:17] you were an attribute of god from before
[31:20] the foundations of the world and god
[31:23] released you
[31:24] into this dimension to fulfill
[31:27] his word
[31:30] your life is no longer
[31:32] your life
[31:34] your life is his life now
[31:37] you've been redeemed by the word of god
[31:40] and when you came to recognize who you
[31:42] were
[31:44] that you were actually a son or a
[31:47] daughter of god you came to realize that
[31:50] there was something inside of you that's
[31:53] taken control of you
[31:55] it's called god's attribute
[31:57] you see we need to identify the
[31:59] difference between
[32:01] man
[32:02] and god
[32:04] human
[32:05] and the spirit of god
[32:08] you are not controlled by this human
[32:10] realm
[32:11] you are controlled by the spirit of god
[32:14] that's been placed in you from before
[32:16] the foundations of the world to fulfill
[32:19] this word amen praise god
[32:23] and so
[32:25] what we're going to be looking at is
[32:28] next slide
[32:30] if my people will humble themselves so
[32:34] this is the first thing we want to look
[32:35] at
[32:36] you know when you think about humility
[32:39] you think about humility and you think
[32:41] it's something that that that um you
[32:44] know uh
[32:46] i can do
[32:48] no
[32:49] it's not something that you can do it's
[32:51] something that you are
[32:53] it's something that you
[32:55] are
[32:56] and we're going to look at
[32:58] some things that identify
[33:00] humility in the scripture
[33:03] because humbling yourself
[33:06] is not something
[33:08] that you do it's something that um that
[33:12] that that god
[33:14] does
[33:16] through an experience
[33:18] with christ
[33:20] through a walk with god as a human
[33:23] walking with god
[33:25] and so
[33:28] uh
[33:29] i don't know what you need restored in
[33:31] your life
[33:33] but whatever it is you're gonna know
[33:35] after
[33:36] hearing some of these things here
[33:38] tonight
[33:40] how you can approach god
[33:42] in the right way
[33:48] humility
[33:52] god is god and i am not the first
[33:55] condition for healing and restoration in
[33:58] your life
[33:59] if my people will humble themselves
[34:01] humility is the first step to healing
[34:06] now
[34:07] i don't approach god arrogantly
[34:11] i don't approach god
[34:13] disrespectfully
[34:17] i don't come to god and demand things
[34:20] that's not humility
[34:23] okay
[34:24] i don't come to god that way
[34:28] did you know that in the scriptures
[34:30] never
[34:31] are you ever commanded to pray for
[34:33] humility
[34:36] so you don't even have to pray for it
[34:40] it's not something that you pray for
[34:42] god please humble me
[34:45] if you pray in that way you're going to
[34:46] be getting more more trials than you've
[34:48] ever had in your life
[34:51] that's not the way to approach it
[34:53] you don't want to ask him to do that
[34:56] it's humiliating
[34:57] you are never to pray god humble
[35:00] me i want you to think about these
[35:03] things because this really struck me
[35:05] why because humility is a choice
[35:09] humility is a choice you know what the
[35:11] opposite of humility is pride
[35:15] pride is the opposite of humility
[35:18] i can do this and i can do that and if i
[35:21] do this and if i pray more and if i pray
[35:24] louder than everybody else then god's
[35:26] going to hear me
[35:28] no that's pride
[35:30] that's not humility
[35:34] instead praying
[35:36] it says humble yourself it's something
[35:38] you do
[35:40] and it's over and over it's you can read
[35:42] this over and over in the scriptures
[35:44] humble yourself humble yourself
[35:47] it says it over and over again in the
[35:49] new testament
[35:51] humility is a choice
[35:54] it's something that you choose
[35:57] in your mind
[35:58] to
[35:59] to not let pride take control of your
[36:01] life
[36:02] we're going to look at some of the
[36:04] things
[36:06] so
[36:07] if that's the first condition for
[36:09] something to be to be restored in my
[36:11] life
[36:12] something to be healed in my life i want
[36:14] to know
[36:16] three things
[36:18] what is humility
[36:20] what does it look like
[36:22] how do i develop it and how do i show
[36:25] god my humility
[36:28] because he says
[36:29] right in the scripture
[36:31] if my people who are called by my name
[36:33] will humble themselves
[36:35] so the first thing we need to recognize
[36:38] is
[36:39] or try to identify is is humility
[36:43] and so we're gonna we're gonna take a
[36:44] little bit of inventory in ourselves
[36:47] and and see what it is that it you know
[36:50] like what really shows the characters of
[36:52] humility
[36:55] first of all
[36:56] we need to be able to confess our sin
[37:00] the moment
[37:02] that you realize it
[37:04] a lot of people you know like they're
[37:06] walking oh i've been walking with god
[37:08] for 25 years and you know what i can't
[37:11] make any mistakes and you know even when
[37:14] you make them you just you know like you
[37:16] get you get so christian you get so
[37:18] christian that you've got christian
[37:20] pride that you're afraid that if you
[37:22] make a mistake you can't confess it
[37:26] we've got to check our attitude
[37:29] we got to check our attitude
[37:31] look at look at what brother branham
[37:32] says here
[37:34] he says here look at the serf
[37:36] seraphician woman
[37:38] when she was told by jesus it's not
[37:40] right for me to take the children's
[37:42] bread
[37:43] and feed you dogs
[37:45] what would you have said
[37:48] if he said that to you
[37:52] join the next church
[37:54] but not her she knew who she was talking
[37:56] to
[37:57] she said lord that's right
[37:59] you're so right in that but the dogs is
[38:02] willing to eat the scraps under the
[38:04] master's table
[38:06] that got him
[38:07] that was it
[38:09] that's what he's waiting for you to do
[38:12] humble yourself
[38:14] into such a place no matter how god
[38:17] sends it to you
[38:19] if you're healed instantly if you're
[38:22] healed by degrees if if you're if you're
[38:25] put off for like abraham was 25 years
[38:28] waiting for the promise but instead of
[38:31] getting weak he got stronger all the
[38:33] time giving praise to god
[38:36] just so that you know that god promised
[38:40] it and you accept it for yourself it's
[38:43] not to come to pass
[38:47] just remember now as i go on re on
[38:50] record in these tapes i say this with
[38:53] all my heart that if any persons will
[38:57] take the right mental attitude towards
[39:00] any divine promise that god has made
[39:03] it'll bring it to pass what's he talking
[39:06] about
[39:07] humility
[39:10] recognizing
[39:12] that when you make a mistake you're
[39:15] willing to just
[39:17] repent
[39:18] you're willing to confess it
[39:20] you're willing to move on
[39:22] you know oh because i'm this or because
[39:24] i'm that even at work
[39:26] wherever whatever you do
[39:30] true humility is not looking
[39:33] so much itself all the time it's looking
[39:36] at others and how others
[39:39] can be
[39:41] benefited how others can be affected
[39:44] around you
[39:46] humility is forgiving quickly
[39:50] being able to quickly forgive someone
[39:52] you know when something happens and you
[39:54] know you know like things happen
[39:57] you know
[39:58] right away you know most people they
[40:00] want to point out
[40:02] when somebody makes a mistake
[40:04] they want to point it out instead of
[40:05] just you know forgiving them for that
[40:07] mistake
[40:09] and being able to move on that's that's
[40:11] true humility not carrying grudge
[40:14] you know grudges that's prideful
[40:16] humility is forgiving quickly you never
[40:19] hold on to a grudge
[40:22] you got to let go you confess your sin
[40:25] and and you move on amen humble people
[40:28] are forgiving people
[40:31] they are
[40:35] number three you are treated unfairly
[40:38] when you're treated unfairly be quiet
[40:46] you know we're doing 40 days of prayer
[40:48] and and uh you know these are things
[40:51] here that you might think okay well you
[40:53] know
[40:54] what are we looking at all these simple
[40:56] things for because this is all part
[40:59] of really
[41:00] breaking certain habits in our lives
[41:03] and and
[41:04] having real change take place in our
[41:07] lives
[41:12] when you're when you're treated unfairly
[41:14] be quiet and patient and don't retaliate
[41:18] that's real humility
[41:22] that's when you're more like christ
[41:26] you know you look at christ when when he
[41:29] stood before pilate
[41:33] pilate turned and says don't you know
[41:34] who i am don't you know that i can
[41:37] i have the power to to crucify you or
[41:40] set you free
[41:43] if you're a true son or daughter of god
[41:47] and somebody comes and tries to absurd
[41:49] power and authority
[41:51] and and demand over your life
[41:55] or or get hard with you or whatever
[41:59] you know who's really in control don't
[42:01] you
[42:04] remember the first thing we need to
[42:05] recognize is
[42:06] we're not in control he's in control
[42:10] when we allow him
[42:12] to do
[42:13] what he said he was going to do in our
[42:15] lives all we got to do is walk with him
[42:21] the bible says that when they stood him
[42:24] before the governor pilate and others it
[42:27] says he spake not a word unto them
[42:31] i am most like christ when i absorb the
[42:35] attacks
[42:37] you are most like christ when you absorb
[42:40] the attacks
[42:41] that come to you in life and they are
[42:44] going to come
[42:47] but you don't
[42:48] allow them
[42:51] to make you something that you're not
[42:56] number four when you look for ways to
[42:59] serve others
[43:00] that shows humility when you look for
[43:03] ways to serve others when you look for
[43:05] ways to to do things that are going to
[43:08] help others instead of expecting to be
[43:10] served
[43:13] serve
[43:17] when you accept criticism and correction
[43:19] graciously that shows god
[43:23] humility in you when you don't fight to
[43:27] get the best seat or the best table or
[43:29] the best parking spot
[43:32] that's humility
[43:36] you know i
[43:40] i just believe god that when i go into a
[43:42] parking lot there's a spot waiting for
[43:44] me
[43:45] i mean that's just that that's just
[43:47] simple
[43:48] so i don't have to look you know and say
[43:50] oh there it is oh that car's i got to
[43:52] get there before him
[43:56] it's not necessary
[43:58] you need to walk with god knowing who's
[44:02] in control
[44:03] these are simple truths but you know
[44:06] when i was looking at all of this i say
[44:08] my god it's the truth
[44:10] we really need to take inventory of
[44:12] these areas in our lives
[44:14] amen
[44:15] that's true intentionally being friends
[44:19] befriending people who have no status
[44:22] or who can't help you or who are
[44:25] overlooked by society that's humility
[44:30] you know walking down the street be
[44:32] friendly show yourself friendly don't be
[44:35] afraid of anybody
[44:38] you know that you're walking with god
[44:40] you don't you don't need to fear
[44:42] you know it
[44:43] you can you can
[44:44] treat
[44:45] anybody with love and respect
[44:49] it shows a person that has character
[44:52] and they're truly humble
[44:54] not because they're trying to be humble
[44:58] that's not humility when you try to be
[45:01] humble
[45:01] that's pride
[45:05] think about it
[45:09] humility is being respectful to the
[45:12] authorities in your life
[45:15] there's authorities in our lives
[45:17] we need to be respectful to those
[45:19] authorities in our lives even the bad
[45:22] ones
[45:24] sometimes we got a bad boss
[45:28] you know somebody that that's just plain
[45:30] nasty
[45:31] always pride
[45:34] showing pride all the time
[45:36] you just need to just step back
[45:40] it's not easy
[45:42] but it's the truth humility is when
[45:45] you pick up trash whenever you find it
[45:52] i'm telling you you know you're walking
[45:54] like
[45:55] you're walking somewhere and there's a
[45:57] big piece of trash in front of you like
[46:00] it's like you know you don't have to
[46:01] kick it out of the way
[46:04] it shows somebody that has character
[46:07] when they can pick up that piece of
[46:09] trash and throw it in the garbage these
[46:10] are simple things but
[46:12] just think about it just think about it
[46:15] humility is when you leave a public
[46:17] restroom cleaner than when you found it
[46:21] you ever do that
[46:24] it's okay to do it
[46:26] you know sometimes you go in there and
[46:28] there's paper all over the floor and
[46:30] man i i
[46:32] i just do it automatic i
[46:34] i just do it automatic
[46:36] i just grab another towel and i'll pick
[46:38] up the other towels and i'll throw them
[46:39] in the garbage and i'll leave
[46:43] i'm not saying that because all of i'm
[46:45] humble no just it's just something that
[46:47] i've i'm a bit of a clean freak
[46:50] you know
[46:51] sometimes i just get a little bit
[46:52] carried away
[46:54] but when i saw that i thought oh
[46:56] hallelujah there's a character of
[46:58] humility
[47:01] and it is true
[47:03] it is humbling to do things that you
[47:06] know you you would think oh let the
[47:08] cleaner do it
[47:13] when you
[47:13] admit your weaknesses in your sins
[47:17] to a few safe people
[47:19] it's okay
[47:21] you know to confide in some people that
[47:24] you trust
[47:26] and that you can you know that you can
[47:28] um
[47:29] let go of certain things that you're
[47:32] carrying you know you don't need to
[47:34] carry those things sometimes when you
[47:35] release those things
[47:37] with somebody that you love and confide
[47:40] in and you can really trust
[47:42] you can you know you can trust a person
[47:44] when you tell them something and you
[47:47] never hear it from anybody else
[47:50] you know that that person is somebody
[47:52] you can trust
[47:54] you should have somebody like that in
[47:56] your life
[47:58] that no matter what
[48:00] it's like you're putting it into a safe
[48:02] because they got a revelation of god
[48:05] you've got a revelation of god and
[48:07] you've you you realize uh that that
[48:09] there's an enemy out there
[48:11] there's an enemy that's constantly
[48:13] trying to bring you down and to smash
[48:16] you and defeat you
[48:18] in in any way that he possibly can
[48:23] you don't have to tell everybody but
[48:25] revealing your feelings
[48:28] is the beginning of healing
[48:30] it's something that you know because
[48:31] we're talking about you know healing and
[48:33] restoration here um this is good this is
[48:35] only going to be part one here tonight
[48:37] and it's gonna uh there's gonna be a
[48:39] part two and you're gonna see how this
[48:40] builds up and um you're gonna be really
[48:43] blessed as a result of it i i know for
[48:46] sure so i'm not good at this
[48:51] you know uh
[48:52] you can you can go to tell somebody you
[48:54] know like i'm kind of weak in this area
[48:56] you know this is something that that
[48:58] that i've been carrying you know i'm
[49:00] struggling with this is my temptation
[49:03] you know like um if there's you know
[49:07] don't be afraid to confess
[49:09] certain things
[49:11] amen
[49:14] that's
[49:15] humility
[49:20] another
[49:21] characteristic is when you always speak
[49:24] well of others
[49:28] there you know
[49:29] i just don't find any benefit whatsoever
[49:33] in speaking negative about
[49:36] anybody or anything
[49:39] other than the devil
[49:42] and usually
[49:44] it's in prayer
[49:46] attacking the enemy
[49:48] and putting him in his position
[49:51] that
[49:54] is
[49:55] the true characteristic
[49:57] of a son or a daughter of god
[50:00] not gossiping
[50:03] not talking
[50:04] about others in a negative way that
[50:07] shows that you're you're trying to make
[50:09] yourself better than the other
[50:12] always have something you know
[50:15] negative to say so somebody will do
[50:17] something and they'll do it so well
[50:20] but you will point out the one little
[50:22] negative thing that they did
[50:26] it shows that you've got a little bit of
[50:28] pride
[50:30] you need to overcome certain aspects of
[50:33] your character in those areas
[50:36] thinking that because you can identify
[50:39] the the thing that that was wrong that
[50:41] that makes you a little higher and a
[50:43] little more you know uh you got more
[50:46] discernment on the situation and you can
[50:48] and so you've got to speak it to other
[50:50] people to make you know other people
[50:52] think that oh i'm so spiritual or i'm
[50:54] sold this or that or i've got no
[50:58] no speak well
[51:00] of others
[51:01] always speak well of others
[51:04] there are times when people need to be
[51:06] corrected there are times when
[51:08] situations do rise up
[51:11] god has a provided way of dealing with
[51:13] those situations
[51:15] and we must allow god to deal with those
[51:17] situations
[51:19] in his way
[51:21] and when he does it
[51:22] it restores and it heals the person it
[51:25] doesn't tear down the person
[51:29] amen
[51:32] speaking well of others
[51:34] and then finally praying
[51:37] for your enemies
[51:41] because there's going to be people out
[51:42] there that you know situations out there
[51:44] that that you know
[51:46] they're after you
[51:48] so don't get
[51:51] defense
[51:53] full and get so
[51:54] caught up that you've got to you know um
[51:57] be so
[51:59] uh
[52:01] ready to fight
[52:02] up pray for the situation pray for their
[52:07] restoration pray for their healing pray
[52:10] that the lord will help them in those
[52:12] areas
[52:14] amen praise god
[52:17] humility
[52:18] is not thinking less of yourself oh i'm
[52:23] i'm you know i'm no good you know you
[52:25] hear these people oh i'm no good you
[52:26] know i can't do this and i can't do that
[52:29] that's that you know what that is that's
[52:31] not humility
[52:34] that's just pride
[52:36] humility is not
[52:39] thinking less of yourself it's thinking
[52:43] of yourself less
[52:48] humility
[52:50] is you're so busy focused on god and
[52:53] helping other people you don't even
[52:55] think about yourself
[52:58] if you go into a party and you walk in
[53:01] and you start thinking how do i look to
[53:04] everybody
[53:06] who am i full who am i focused on me
[53:10] how i you know how do i look
[53:14] you know how's my hair how's my suit
[53:16] how's my you know like like that's just
[53:18] all pride
[53:24] when i walk in
[53:26] who could probably use a word of
[53:27] encouragement today
[53:30] when you go into a situation
[53:32] that's humility humility is not thinking
[53:35] less of yourself i'm bad i'm no good i'm
[53:38] nothing i'm zero i'm zip
[53:41] no that's false humility
[53:44] humility is you're so busy focused on
[53:48] god
[53:49] and other people you just don't even
[53:51] think
[53:53] about yourself
[54:02] it's a hard way to live
[54:05] you know when you look at all these
[54:07] things that we've talked about
[54:09] you might look at it and say oh man you
[54:11] know like i really gotta
[54:13] sharpen up no you just need to break
[54:15] certain habits
[54:17] and allow change to come into your life
[54:19] as a character as a as a son or as a
[54:21] daughter of god
[54:24] and it's a choice
[54:25] it's just a choice to say you know what
[54:27] i'm going to humble
[54:30] myself
[54:31] by keeping my mouth
[54:33] shut
[54:35] more
[54:37] you know what i mean it's a choice of of
[54:39] not allowing
[54:41] certain aspects of your character that
[54:44] you might have bad habits of certain
[54:47] ways the way that you deal with
[54:48] situations let
[54:50] god show you here tonight that you can
[54:54] actually
[54:55] choose
[54:58] to make change in some of these areas in
[55:00] your life
[55:05] so let's look at some of these um
[55:11] next slide it says if i humble if i'm
[55:13] humble god will guide me look at let's
[55:16] look at some of the benefits that come
[55:19] with humility
[55:22] you know because it's important to
[55:23] understand
[55:24] why it is that he said in the scripture
[55:27] if my people who are called by my name
[55:28] shall humble themselves we're looking at
[55:31] this right now
[55:32] because if if we do there's a there's a
[55:35] there's a benefit to doing it
[55:38] and one of the benefits is that god
[55:40] will guide
[55:42] me
[55:43] look at the next scripture
[55:45] next slide it says here in in psalms 25
[55:48] 9 god leads the humble in the right way
[55:52] and teaches them
[55:54] his will
[55:58] it's beautiful isn't it
[56:00] simple but very beautiful
[56:03] are you moving the slides through
[56:09] oh okay
[56:13] well i'll just go on
[56:15] the next one says if i humble if i am
[56:17] humble god will bless me
[56:21] so it says in isaiah 66
[56:24] verse 2 it says i will bless those who
[56:28] have humble and contrite hearts
[56:33] see these are promises right from the
[56:35] word of god
[56:36] we're looking at scripture here we're
[56:38] looking at you know how it is that that
[56:40] we're going to benefit how we're going
[56:41] to build the momentum over these next 40
[56:45] days
[56:46] of really
[56:47] experiencing change in our lives
[56:53] next slide if i am humble
[56:55] god will give me the power to change
[57:00] and that's what we need you can put the
[57:03] heat down a bit now brother
[57:08] if you
[57:10] are humble god gives you power to change
[57:17] james 4 6 next slide says god opposes
[57:20] the proud
[57:21] but gives grace to the humble
[57:26] grace are things that you can receive
[57:28] that you don't even deserve
[57:32] but it's because you've become aware of
[57:34] your your your character you've become
[57:37] aware of
[57:39] your weaknesses you know because we all
[57:42] have them
[57:43] as long as we're in human vessels we're
[57:45] gonna have weaknesses brother anthony
[57:47] let's face it right
[57:49] i don't know anybody in here that can
[57:51] say oh i i'm perfect in everything
[57:54] you wouldn't be here
[57:57] there's no way you could be perfect in
[57:59] everything
[58:02] we have weaknesses we need to recognize
[58:04] them but we want god to help us change
[58:09] he's willing to give you the strength
[58:12] to do it i
[58:14] if next slide if i am humble god will
[58:17] relieve my stress how many people have
[58:20] stress
[58:22] everybody has stress
[58:26] as long as you're a mother you're a
[58:28] father you're a brother you're a sister
[58:31] you're a you're a husband you're a wife
[58:35] my god you know you're a worker i don't
[58:38] know
[58:39] is there anything that you can be in
[58:41] this life that you cannot have stress
[58:43] with
[58:46] even if you're retired and you got
[58:48] millions in the bank you got stress
[58:51] because
[58:52] your health starts to fail
[58:56] so but you know what the beautiful thing
[58:58] is this that if you walk with god
[59:02] and you have a relationship with god
[59:05] and you humble yourself
[59:08] god
[59:08] will relieve your stress
[59:10] look at the scripture
[59:12] next slide matthew 11 29 says
[59:15] take the yoke i give you and learn from
[59:18] me for i am gentle and humble and i will
[59:23] restore deep rest to your soul
[59:27] deep rest to your soul is relieving
[59:30] stress
[59:32] now i know
[59:34] that you have experienced where god
[59:36] relieves stress how many experienced
[59:39] that
[59:41] amen
[59:43] it's beautiful saints
[59:45] i cannot explain it
[59:47] nor can you explain it
[59:49] but when you are in service for the lord
[59:53] you know
[59:54] and you're in the midst of a very
[59:55] stressful situation sometimes then all
[59:58] of a sudden you wake up the next day and
[1:00:01] it's gone
[1:00:03] it's gone the situation that seemed so
[1:00:06] hard so stressful so you know bothersome
[1:00:11] is gone
[1:00:13] god can do that
[1:00:16] he said it right there i will restore
[1:00:19] deep rest
[1:00:21] in your soul
[1:00:26] i'm going to close it off here now
[1:00:28] because
[1:00:30] as we move along here
[1:00:33] um
[1:00:34] we're going to be looking at
[1:00:38] asking god for
[1:00:40] help because it's important to ask
[1:00:46] it's important to recognize that you
[1:00:47] know that when you get to a certain
[1:00:49] place
[1:00:51] you need to ask
[1:00:54] and you know you look back at the
[1:00:56] scripture
[1:00:57] that um
[1:01:00] that
[1:01:01] he said here
[1:01:04] if my people who are called by my name
[1:01:06] will humble themselves
[1:01:08] and seek my face
[1:01:11] we're gonna be going a lot deeper into
[1:01:13] this
[1:01:15] on the part two series
[1:01:17] but just to give you an idea
[1:01:20] seeking god's face
[1:01:23] seeking him
[1:01:29] seeking the lord
[1:01:31] is something that that you know a lot of
[1:01:33] us
[1:01:36] we've done it in the past
[1:01:39] but there's a level of seeking god
[1:01:42] that you're going to discover as you
[1:01:45] continue
[1:01:46] in these 40 days of prayer
[1:01:49] that you're going to enter into a
[1:01:50] greater revelation of seeking the lord
[1:01:56] of really getting personal with god
[1:02:00] of really moving on
[1:02:02] to the next
[1:02:03] stages
[1:02:04] of what it is
[1:02:06] to really seek the lord
[1:02:09] praise god come ahead brother anthony
