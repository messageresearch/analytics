praise the lord this morning glory be his name amen [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] amen please be seated first of all i just wanted to say thank you to all of you who have been serving the lord and coming to this assembly for so many years you've seen something i saw something in the word and that has kept me and it's keeping me and i thank the lord for that and i'm so glad to see the tree of life bearing fruit and to see the fruit ripening on the tree and i give god the glory for that every single one of you here amen amen i thank god for you amen god bless you real good i didn't think i would have anything to say actually this morning but then of course uh you know it's all this faith you know even preaching the word here is faith because um i have to believe that god will give me something else for next week you might say to me oh yeah the lord will give you some you know but it's not that easy when you are the one that has got to believe and wait until and if he speaks the last minute you are you just because you don't know what am i going to say but thank god uh he is great amen not to say that if i don't have anything to say thank god these wonderful instruments in the church uh i don't mean the guitars i mean like brother christian brother tim and brother danny and you know desmond and so on this other brothers here that god can use right but i'm glad to be here this morning and i'm glad to be able to say that lord has given me a message and the lord has given me something to say glory to god and when i say that these past months but say almost a year i'm not just preaching because i went and studied and searched the bible to find a sub topic it's the holy spirit coming and saying say this and so how am i going to say that that is so i don't see nothing there but no but as i wait then all of a sudden it starts to come and and so i can clearly say it's not just me i'm doing the talking but the message is not me it's the holy spirit himself talking to his own people so we give god the glory for that amen praise the lord and i am really thankful when i say it it's not just um you know like fraught on a beer some people just talk for talking sake but i'm saying i'm thankful to every one of you because every one of you i know went through and maybe still is uh going through ups and downs all kinds of trials and that is why the bible talks about overcomers right you know you don't realize but the other thing that you have overcome and the things you've gone through some people wouldn't be alive they can't even take it they're gone but you're still standing here no matter how much you might be shrieky tuttering this way that way you're still standing on the so we world god [Applause] amen god bless you god to see you god god bless you good to see you there brother amen god bless you brother praise the lord real good every one of you here in the house of the lord we're living in such great dangerous times scripture is being fulfilled and the things that are happening and about to happen is not of our concern in the sense we got to watch it but it's not about concern because the the foundations are being prepared for the great change we're going from trouble that we get in troubles to their tribulation right so we are moving the whole thing is moving uh but you don't get worried about what's happening around you because that brings you closer to your salvation than you suppose like paul said we are nero and as i used to sing years ago we're almost home we're almost home it's about to unfold and take place before us and all these questions that theologians try to answer well how's it going to happen are we going to fly up through the air is this going to happen is we going to suddenly disappear from the planes we are in the pilot god we don't care how it happens as long as we are in it and we are part of it we don't care how it happens and i give god praise and glory for all of that i thank god for the worship leader this morning you know by by him um the holy spirit was reassuring me um that what you what i give you to say that is what you have to say he said no of course he don't know that and it's not something he even said it's just what's what's coming off of him caused me to know that and i give god praise and honor and glory for it um yes matter of fact at one point there i thought he was going to just lose his speech and and start speaking up in town i was waiting to hear well what is he and the minute left him and it going to others and on the congregation uh you know i want to know what in the world i said somebody gonna speak in tongues this morning praise the lord i hope it's not you hold it back brother mike but but thank god brother that left this god's spirit is moving amen and we thank the lord for his great grace and knowledge amen now shall we look into the word of god and give him praise and honor and glory look amen if i just go on commenting like that we'll i'll just be talking casually and talking casually uh but um let's go to the word mark 16 and we are going to read from verses 15 to 18. very familiar scripture we all know it praise god have you found it okay let's read god's word go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be done and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new towns they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover praise god let us pray gracious heavenly father we thank you for the reading of thy word and we pray great holy spirit that you will take praise and honor and glory as you speak to your children just for a while bless us now we pray in jesus name amen please succeeded now you know there's a lot of town speaking going on we are living in a time where it's a lot of speaking in town some pentecost is at its height and um it's getting more and more with a lot of tongues speaking but i don't want to talk about those towns at all i will have to speak on them to be able to touch on what i have to say but they are not my emphasis the thing about this is in mark 16 uh verse 17 the lord is speaking and says they that believe in my name amen they shall these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils and we pass over this all the time and i did too they shall speak with new towns they shall speak with new towns and i want to talk about that new towns amen now if you wanna if you know this here he said they shall speak with new terms or in other words with a new language they're going to speak a new language and uh the bible tells us there um who what is that are going to speak with this new language them that believe and what shall they do when they get this language they shall speak they're going to preach they're going to testify they're gonna speak with new terms and the instrument or the tool that they're gonna use to get over their preaching their teaching or their testimony whatever they're gonna say they're going to be using these new terms or this new language that they're going to receive 800 years before this time the prophet isaiah if you'll turn to your bible chapter 28 isaiah 28 verse and 9 19. you don't mind me starting slowly taking the time here but isaiah 28 9 to 13. if you turn in your bible it reads like this matter of fact we can all read it together uh reading from verse 19. let's see if i got nine sorry whom shall we teach knowledge and whom shall we make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from milk and drawn that drawn from the breast for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to his people to whom he said this is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest this is refreshing yet they would not hear but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept precepts upon precept lying upon line line upon line here little and they were little that that they may go back and fall and fall backwards backslide and be broken be snared and taken amen praise the lord jesus hallelujah i just want to um stop there now we first of all god is speaking actually in this scripture here to two groups and the first group that both groups are going to receive the same word here little there little line up online precept upon precept because it plainly says the word of the lord came through isaiah then it goes down into a next verse there and it says and the word of the lord came and it came to this group the first group he said when the word of the lord comes to them it will cause them to have knowledge it will cause them to understand doctrine and it will be a time of refreshing uh upon them and it will bring them into the believer's rest versus a time of refreshing and a time when they're gonna enter into the believer's rest that's the first group the second group the same word same message came unto them but what is that supposed to cause we know what it caused and what happened with the first group that received it but what's it supposed to happen or cause in the second group cause some to go back others to fall backward in other words some to go back leave the message complete leave the word complete they just go back walk away from it don't know it others to pull backwards they pull back so they backslide then it says and some to be broken while yet others will be snared which the word snare means trapped they will be trapped and taken away amen praise the lord well one prophet said that 800 years before and then here is another prophet 2 800 years later this prophet of the 20th century amen and in the unveiling of god which i have used that quotation to many of you my subject this morning i trust god will reveal this and it each time if you take the tapes and listen that you may have a spiritual understanding of what god has been trying to get over to his church while without him saying it right out see it's it's a thing it's something we sometimes we have to say things in such a way that it might send the crowd down that it might bring some to go out and others to just leave and others to ponder over but that is done purposely and it must be done that way then it might be said some of you will say you brother bran you mean god would purposely do a thing like that he certainly did and he does it yet now he still is doing it right now so i'm showing you the one prophet said the same thing exactly some to fall back some to go out you know and so it's right there in isaiah and here comes this prophet 28 200 years later and he is saying the same thing to the generation that we are in praise god so i thank god for this prophet that he sent us who spoke to us nothing but the truth amen praise god now we're going to the day of pentecost acts chapter 2 verse 4. now when we come to uh the day of pentecost which was fully come they of course left uh and went to the upper room waiting on the promise of the holy spirit because it was promised by isaiah that stammering lives with another town where like he'll pour out his spirit upon his people it'll be a time of refreshing it'll be this little give knowledge and wisdom praise god hallelujah god promised it amen and jesus said when if you believe you're a true believer you will speak with new tongues so when they went up on the day of pentecost they the holy ghost came upon them and broke he was broke himself up into little pieces and so that he couldn't fill them and fill them with himself god in the believers and there they were and the bible said they were filled with the holy ghost and they began to speak with other towns as the spirit gave them utterance the spirit of god uttering those words through them to the generation that they were in and the bible tells you clearly that those men heard them speaking in dance so we believe in speaking in dance i believe in speaking in towns i thank god that he sent the holy spirit but you see pentecost made their mistake right there because they believe they're speaking in times as a gibber and a jabber and as long as they are coming forth with some strange tongue and language they are speaking in towns but that's not what god was talking about jesus said they shall speak with new tongues hallelujah new tongues they're going to speak with praise god i want you to see her clearly my friends here in the bible that this time that they were using the disciples i mean that all the men as brother branham has said he said where pentecost made their mistake they put the emphasis on the young speaking and not upon the hearing for we heard them speak with other towns or not all these men galileans but how they're speaking galileans which we all know but yet we can hear them in our own language that was the supernatural taking place that was the holy spirit on the scene making himself known and they were all amazed they were in wonder at what was going on so but pentecost today has it that everybody gets in the spirit and everybody begins to jabber and jibber and say something and it becomes one chaos and confusion everywhere and even paul said if you're speaking in tongues like that uh will one come in your midst won't it be confusion they can't understand they don't know what you are saying whatever but here in the bible and if you have the time listen to brother brandon's message on the debate the debate on tongues where he said see and and there's where some theologians were questioning him on this topic and he was answering them and they couldn't answer him when he came out and said listen it's on the hearing they heard them speak with tongues praise god because they were anointed with the word with the holy spirit in them so when they were listening they could know that these men were speaking in a in a language that i already know it wasn't a language they didn't know but the language they already know but yet when they were speaking we can hear what they are saying is is supernatural it's the wonderful works of god it's the wonders of the living god and they begin to praise and honor god hallelujah they want to know if they were drunk but they were not drunk with natural wine they were drunk with the holy ghost and they were bringing the word of god hallelujah amen when they all spoke uh you know as brother branham asked this gentleman and the gentleman in particular he said when you received the holy ghost did you speak with towns the man said yes he says and when you spoke in tongues that that all the people understand you he says no because i i was speaking in tongues he said well you don't have the original pentecost you weren't really baptized with the holy ghost he says because back in the bible there when they spoke all the people heard and the bible wanted you to be sure that the whole world could understand what they were saying because it says greek people from mesopotamia cerrini here there it mentions the different groups so you might know it's not a mistake everybody heard what they were saying everybody recognized what they were saying because it was the holy ghost speaking through them and using them for the glory of god hallelujah amen that's my friends is exactly what it was amen so the new terms is not like some uh other natural language you know we got languages dialects all around the world some we don't even know yet some in the in the woods we haven't even discovered some of those people speaking dialects they're out there but this new tongue that jesus promised is not some new language it's not some new dialect that we are all gonna speak that new dialect whatsoever hallelujah but when they were speaking that new tongue everybody knew it was about the wonderful works of god i want to follow this up by the fact brother branham used to turn he says did you notice that when jesus came and he could have just told them openly and plainly who he was and what this is and what that is but he says no but jesus spoke in parables through his entire ministry and what i am saying now if you follow up unveiling of god just after he said what he said that these things are said like that god deliberately put it that way it's not just said openly but it's said in such a way right that only a certain set of people will be able to pick it up right so he said so i i speak that way and it's set that way purposely that way and even the lord jesus when he was on the scene he said he spoke in parables to the people and all they heard was parables amen now listen hear ye him there is no contradiction in god's word for it is written entirely in parables and it's purposely done that way see to confuse the wise the prudent saw that god may reveal it to them babes and sucklings that would learn god wrote the entire thing in riddles he wrote it in parables so that he could hide it see from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it in other words to his children to babes such as would learn amen you see because you don't know it it's not like going and reading a newspaper it is a spiritual revelation and it's only revealed to them who are interested in learning it and you will never learn that by school you'll never learn that by theology it's got to be known by revelation because the entire bible the entire plan of god everything in this bible even your salvation is based upon the revelation of jesus christ hallelujah praise god amen oh my friends what a day what an hour smilian church age who who has known the mind of god that they might instruct him but paul said but you have the mind of christ who have known the mind of god but you have the mind of christ you understand praise god who has the mind of christ but you have the mind of christ paul says matthew 13 13 to 16 therefore speak eye to them in bibles because they're seeing they see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfill the prophecy of isaias which said by hearing you shall hear and shall not understand you're going to hear the same thing but you're not understanding is that right you're hearing the same thing but you're not understanding and seeing you shall see and yet not perceive for this people's heart is what's gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have clothes lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i would heal them but blessed are your eyes blessed are your ears for they hear blessed are your eyes for you see amen smyrna church praise god brothers what a blessing but to know we are living in this hour hallelujah amen oh marvelous listen to the word of the living god now there is no devil not church not theologian that all can overstep the boundaries of the proof and abstract of god in the life of an individual because the baptism of the holocaust has recognized you in jesus christ and raise you up in him and now you can see the word of god for the hour and for your day hallelujah the only reason why you can see because the holy ghost baptism recognize you that is god's recognition on you hallelujah and the seed life of god that was in you began to open up and as it began to open up your eyes open up your ears open up you begin to see you begin to hear you begin to grow up as a tree of righteousness in christ the word the water of the word for his glory hallelujah oh my and when it comes what does it do the all things leave what does it do to your mortal body it changes your opinions changes all them ideas and notions that you used to have all god why because the baptism the holy ghost come and recognize you woke up the seed of god in you amen it begins to set your affection on the things which are above all them smoking drinking gambling things you used to do is dead because what you've been raised up and then things are now beneath you amen you are quickened quickened by the power of god and it it begins to bring your body your entire being listen this into a rapturing condition get your ready for the rapture take you out to here notice the petty cost of people when the real ones when the pentecostal people on the day of pentecost received their title deed from god you know what it began to do it come to them listen close again and it glorified their souls not your spirit not anointing on your body to make you jibber jabber and jump around it anointed us glorify their soul hallelujah in other words your soul start to go into a transfiguration it begins to change it begins to come to a place where god can rapture it out of here hallelujah oh my i'm not drifting from my original subject this is all part of it give god the glory amen hallelujah oh my see and so when it come and began to glorify their souls they screamed they saw tongues of fire separated and coming upon each of them it's so quick in their body until they couldn't even speak earthly language like that anymore it quickened their body until they began to speak a heavenly language that began to speak a heavenly language new tongue new tongue they were given a new town speaking a heavenly language i'm guided by the holy ghost amen praise god you see that it has to be that way for to speak that heavenly language because of the place where they are going to so they got to start speaking that language right here so they're speaking to the place where they're going to so the quickening power had to come and shake their mortal bodies till their entire mortal language was just taken from them transfigured transformed amen into an immortal language when the quickening part comes changes that to something to somewhere where they belong for if the same spear that raised christ from the dead dwells you he shall also quicken your mortal bodies you'll find that in the easter seal amen praise god forevermore i give him glory for his word this morning amen glory to god so brothers what do you see with the modern pentecostal here today gibbering jabbering speaking in all manner of towns what what what to find out with them it's like when israel was in the land and uh they wanted to come in and be with israel uh you know and they said look uh we are warning you they sent some men in amongst them and israel said well for me to know if you're an israelite we want you to speak speak our language they give them a word test and as much as they tried to pronounce the word shibale they can't say it they can't say you see they caught in the word test because every time they try to pronounce the word they can't pronounce it correctly oh my and so israel said no you are not a real jew you're not a real believer at all because you don't have the word amen see and they were able to recognize them praise god of course you know tongues and in tongues plus interpretation is prophecy right tongues plus interpretation is equal to prophecy praise god hallelujah uh okay let me continue on here praise god hallelujah uh uh how wonderful it is my brothers to see how that god anointed the language that they already had and transformed it and transfigured it until that language become a heavenly language preparing them for the place the prophet said they're going to praise god wonderful to know that that he's the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah now you heard the term of uh the tongues of men and of angels is that right amen even paul used that term uh the tongue of men and of angels but this was not the tongue isaiah was speaking of right at all whatsoever he said with some are going to speak they're going to speak with stammering lips but he says and another tongue you know whenever you see that word and it's a conjunction it tells you that one thing is not the same thing you know the one is following the other he says a stammering lips and another tongue jesus come and says then that belief shall speak with new tongues amen praise the lord hallelujah now we find out that on the day of pentecost these men spoke with towns there is no doubt about it there's awkward towns but how could it be speaking in towns when they were speaking galilean they were talking their own language just like you and me we talk in english isn't that right but under the anointing while they were talking english let me use the word english so you understand war yet all the people are wrong could hear them all the people could understand them praise the lord is coffee here praise the lord brother coffee you were with me right when that you know where i'm going right i talk to you before i come up here to preach no okay so i'm right i know your mind went right there i explained to them in a nice testimony of what happened speak loud because it has to go on or you want to come up here and speak it quickly no it's all right oh no no he can come up and he can speak it quickly here sorry you don't have to turn it once you talk it's gonna pick you up okay and you don't have to go close all right go ahead i and pastor salmon went to ghana you all remember those days and i and him was incar and there was a brother that i know again even brad desmond philip know him his name is alex we're talking in a ashanti language my language in ghana but someone was sitting it was in the car he was sitting in the front the driver driving me and the brother was i was sitting on the driver back unless was sitting in the middle and all of a sudden we're talking in our language and the language we were talking the brother asked me is pastor simon a ghanaian i says no he's not a ghanaian we're speaking ashanti language which is my language and we keep on talking talking then all of a sudden pasta salmon just turned his head and says oh brothers you are saying this you are saying this you are saying this you are saying this and the brother says oh but you told me the pastor does your pastor doesn't it's not a ghanaian and he doesn't understand ghana the ashanti language how is it that he's interpreting the language to us and pastor salman just says but you said you believe the holy ghost i passed someone don't know nothing but the holy ghost know all the languages he wrote their language i saw it i i think i have told some of you some of you believers have said this to you it was so direct my goodness so that's what pasta is telling it's real i saw it praise the lord [Applause] i just want you to understand that on the day of pentecost all of them were speaking together and all of the people heard them and they were speaking galilean are not all these galilean but they were hearing them in whatever country language town or whatever they came from they were hearing it praise god so just to pause they were talking and i wasn't paying any attention they were in the car i wasn't paying any attention whatsoever because i don't understand what they're talking but all of a sudden then it's just like if you're talking to me in english i i started understanding i thought they had changed from their language to english so that's why i could hear them talking i didn't even know anything supernatural what's going on so i'm listening to them while they're talking talking talking so that's why i naturally came out i didn't come out like i had a revelation i just naturally say oh you brothers were talking about this and saying that and that's when they got shot and then we realized that something took place you see but it's real because friends to prove it peter got up in acts chapter 2 verse 38 man and bread went when they asked him what shall we do to be saved hallelujah and he began to answer them tell him repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ the point here is now god bring it down to one man speaking and yet when the one man was speaking under this anointing of the new tongues all of them heard him everyone under the sun heard the words that peter stopped because they were speaking under that anointing oh thank god did they have some other strange language that they had was here what what he's gonna stand there and speak in a hundred languages for each group to hear him no god is his own interpreter [Music] god is his own interpreter praise god and that is why this was the fulfillment of what jesus was talking about when he says them not believe they shall speak with new towns hallelujah and when they spoke without new towns these people heard and understood what peter was saying amen but bless god brothers the pentecostals are very proud that they speak in other tongues and they do all these things but this is really not what paul was saying to them first corinthians 13 though i speak in the tongues of men and of angels but you have not the capstone revelation amen you don't have charity it profits you nothing no matter how much you study no matter how much you go and do this or do that and you don't have the revelation of this word to cap off your entire life he says what you become a sounding brass and a tickling symbol oh yeah you can preach oh yeah you can testify oh you can sing oh you can do all these things you can carry on everything else like that you can make all the sounds and everything else but it doesn't have the core of the revelation of the holy spirit in the middle of it my brothers and sisters you are a sounding brass a tickling symbol and you are empty of the word of god empty of the word of god hallelujah praise god forevermore now let me bring it in a way practically let me just say it briefly in a practical way you know right now i didn't even know if he brought my attention to it and some of us might have alluded to it you know with the real genuine revelation of the message a bunch of us get together or two of us talking it and you know somebody else will be right there listening to the whole thing what are they talking about amen what is going on what is this amen but it's not that they don't understand what you're saying naturally we know you're gathering we know you're talking english we we know you're the same thing but but but what is it we're hearing it's what they're hearing now this what we're hearing is different i never heard anything like this before you're speaking the new term you didn't even know it but you were speaking the new town god has given you a new language this message was actually training you and giving you a new language for the place that you're going all unconsciously done because the holy spirit himself is the one doing it interpreting the word to your heart to your life to your entire being praise god you don't have to think about it you don't have to interpret nothing you don't have to learn nothing because you are under the anointing of the holy spirit you have ever stood by and watched two brothers talking this message and while they are fellowshipping on a message you can sense when the anointing strike their soul and the word starts pouring out of them you might as well be listening to another language or another tongue because it just carries you away you're caught up amen under the anointing of this new tongue of the holy spirit upon your heart and upon your life amen praise god hallelujah amen and you have not charity you're nothing but a a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol because you don't have the revealed word all you're producing is empty religious songs that's all you're producing how many of you i've come it's a pastor i don't know i was in this service i was in this church it is not that is a wonderful brother wonderful sisters wonderful preaching wonderful anointing but you know it's just something i couldn't feel something there in my soul it couldn't feed me i i wasn't gathering anything why good people but something grass and tickling simple amen empty of revelation empty religious sounds amen hallelujah but to us it brings to us a time of refreshing we feel refreshed when we got under the influence of the world we get more understanding we understand the doctrine of the word of god hallelujah amen praise god line up online line upon land praise god you begin to get the new towns of the elect you get the new tongue of the bride hallelujah for the holy spirit anoints you when he said they shall speak with new towns amen hallelujah the new tongue of course is heard by everybody but only understood by the elect hallelujah you can go even in the public and speak the word you're not talking some other different language you're speaking just the same language and even you yourself have said to me many times but i don't understand i am telling them it's so plain but they can't see they can't understand they can't hear because you're speaking you already start speaking in a heavenly language amen you're speaking already in a heavenly language under the holy spirit amen praise god amen hallelujah so then jesus said my sheep will hear my voice yes praise god they're going to hear my voice praise god and what is it they understand that this message is a shout it's a it's a crime it's a call to the rapture amen because this voice is calling you for the rapture praise god hallelujah amen now he says my lord you see lord be mortal someday this great thing that we're speaking of you see we'll see it for when jesus died on a cross he was forsaken by man and when he did do you realize that on the cross he spoke in another language do you understand hallelujah in other words he spoke in tongues amen that when his locks were baited down with blood and he cried out amen when he cried out like that you see it began to move up through them rest of seeds down here amen right on up out the same thing coming to them and it always come through the blood by the holy spirit amen prophet said the blood is the word and the spirit lives in the word amen and the spirit comes out of the word for the life is in the blood amen praise god hallelujah and when he cried there from calvary amen he said that that cry went and affected all them seeds that were there praise god to this day and this hour the seeds of god have been affected by the cry of the holy spirit when he spoke in another language there that i will restore amen praise god hallelujah listen he's not finished he speaks here in faith that the faith that was once delivered to the saints do you understand what i am saying do you understand in type that adam did not understand the language of that lamb that abel slew adam they didn't understand when the lamb was bleeding he said they did not understand what was it he the lamb was speaking in another language jesus christ died speaking in another language see oh if you understand that's perfect that is an unbelievable type hallelujah but there he was speaking in another language praise god oh my oh my think of it think of it oh when this message goes forth it corrects everything around it and when jesus was there when all on the outside outside a priest on that outside inside was making fun of him and everything he was possessed with a power and possessed with that power he spoke in another language and said out into the spirit world speaking out there it called back even the spirit of a dead girl back to life because now that power was upon him praise god i'm telling you it's on you and me and every one of us now anything could happen as god wills when god wills you know it's not you have any power of yourself can do anything but you are under the influence and the power of the holy spirit just as much of the apostles that were back there even more in this day and in this hour you are walking in a absolute effortless christianity unconscious godliness the holy spirit able to flow through your life and to fulfill his divine will for the glory of god [Music] hallelujah you understand when he was on the cross the seeds i was on his mind yes he knew me oh yes he knew me praise god he knew me brother sister when he cried out the bible is he spoke in tongues the prophet said he spoke another language and it affected all them seeds right down to this time oh glory of god hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen glory to god see one group speaking in tongues and the other one having the new tongue but you see that those tongues was issued under the head of gold and it was it came in by image worship forced to it and ended up in a supernatural hand writing on the wall and it was writing in another language see and it was in a supernatural language and even though that condemnation or judgment was written it took someone with supernatural understanding that could understand it to be able to interpret it then he says amen you see friends the gentile kingdoms issued in on image worship see and it will go out the same way by supernatural works supernatural interpretation all going together working off the supernatural amen that's the way it is hallelujah oh praise god see when god's people got together back there in the book of acts he says there came a song from heaven like a mighty rushing wind that filled a place where they were sitting out in the streets they went speaking in this language god made a preacher out of every one of them see when they went out they preached in a language but in the language that every man could hear them and everything that they said praise god hallelujah praise the lord are you getting what i'm saying praise the lord see god people expect the powerful things of god to be explosive on boom no but god is hides in simplicity he reveals himself in the same that's why if you're not watching it'll go right by you and you won't even know what it is praise god now listen he's gone from all that high talking and he start talking about chickens now and duck and drake and all these things now a man once has had some chickens and he hatched them out now remember let me say this to you listen close for this is not a joke and it is not meant for a joke it is meant to make a point right so it's not just a story he's teaching something from this story he put the duck egg under one of them chickens and it hatched out and the duck was the funniest looking thing that the chickens ever saw amen that's like you walking into a pentecostal church um you know let's go for that let me pass by that amen oh see and one day the old hen led them behind the barn and there was a creek behind that barn and the little duck smelled water and when he smelled that water he took out to the water as hard as he could the old hand said clock clock clock but that duck said honk honk honk he has it for the water why you see he was a duck by nature and when he can smell that water because of that nature that is in him he couldn't keep away from it no matter what he did amen the nature the seed the gene of god inside hallelujah the waters of the world becomes an attraction to your soul you can't stay away from the word of god because the nature in um not something you put on educate yourself religious education or secular education will make real difference you didn't educate yourself into it that nature in you is pulling you drawing you back to the magnet where you come from amen praise be to god hallelujah see oh my see that's the way it is my friends when that nature in you it brings you my friends but they'll bring you to the revealed world in other words amen no church can dictate to them once they they see this amen they can't live any other way because you see it's because now you recognize you got the nature of god in you amen see you got the holy ass of god in you you've got the right thing in you you'll stand for the right thing you'll do the right thing you'll take even the right things you'll live the right way because you're like a duck and you just love the water you love the word amen you'll love the promises of this day and in this hour and if you're a christian then you are like christ amen see o praise god hallelujah men and women if they amount to anything they are men and women that knows how to stand alone with god amen praise god no matter what anyone else says because what they are like their father abraham is that right we are supposed to be abraham's faith seed and uh hear what he says in the calling of abraham god said to abraham abraham separate yourself from your brethren oh my that's a big thing to do isn't it amen because i want you to go on a journey in a strange land i want you to believe a strange message i want you to believe uh you're in the whole world the whole world is here the whole bible is open but i want you to go live in a strange land i want you to see something else hallelujah praise god and i want you to walk among some strange people then people speaks in a strange language hallelujah and that's where i want you to go amen among them that are speaking a strange language a different tongue they're talking over there praise god hallelujah you see because the holy spirit is calling you to be a pilgrim as a journal and to have that different nature in you praise god when the holy ghost makes you realize that nothing you don't have to work works is over is that what isaiah was talking about you have come to the place you have entered the believer's rest amen works is done you recognize who you are you're being refreshed by the word you understand doctrine you understand the word because he'll show you a little here a little there a little there and then you put the whole jigsaw puzzle together it reveals christ christ hidden in his own word amen you begin to see him in his own word amen praise god hallelujah the climax is coming amen the climax is coming see but you must understand brother branham saying one time he says i was speaking preaching the word hallelujah and when i preaching was preaching the word whether god converted their hearing to hear me or whether he changed my words to their language but something taken place and they could understand me hallelujah and many times he says also a discernment and he talked about a woman that was finished and he's talking to her in english but she couldn't understand and as he continued talking all of a sudden she started getting recited on sheldon and everything else and the interpreter had to come and said how come you say you didn't understand the language he said no i don't i was just speaking to her he said but you were speaking to her in her language amen see why in the holy spirit now because you come into this place where you are subject to the holy ghost and another place there he says don't you understand what this is god speaks every language he knows every language and when he comes on the individual anoints the individual amen whenever he wants to he can talk through them to any language any time for his glory and for his honor praise god hallelujah amen praise god the handwriting is on the wall amen think of it only one man left in the kingdom amen that could interpret them unknown tongues amen see oh my think of it god allowing that that to happen and just one man left that could understand that and interpret that but that's the way it is oneness of unity see what is happening now is that all nations want all people to become one like them germany taught everybody the whole world should become germans and try to force the entire world to come one with them russia thinks everybody ought to be russians and do everything to bring everybody to be like them the western world also now listen he said this in 1958 this is not now the western world also thinks that they all should leave over there and come over here so we can all be one see they want them to be one so that everyone can speak one language just like they did in babylon right god said they are one language and he wants them they want them to speak one language again they want them all to be united persons or people but that will never take place under man's dominion amen i'll say this again it will never take place on the man's dominion for but there is coming a time when all nations will be united as one they'll be under one king and that king will be none other than our lord jesus christ hallelujah for daniel saw that that stone is christ and there will be that time of one nation one people and singing one song the old rugged cross praising him all of the grounds then that is sick and sands all of the churches all the denominations all nations all of them uns and everything else he says whatever they may be they are all nothing but sinking sand there'll be one king one language one nation under god jesus christ hallelujah and his people amen praise god amen think about it he says remember it's not just your language fit by experience but god knows that and he doesn't put it in your head but now it's in your heart in other words you speak in the same language you are speaking not a different language but it's a language of the heart not one of your head amen or one of your lips that you learn somewhere and you go out speaking that like that amen oh praise god hallelujah amen here it is he says here think of it uh i heard my own voice speaking in another language and come to find out the little woman was finished she was a finn and the holy spirit had called her name and told her everything else and told her to pray begin to praise god and i don't know nothing about finnish but it was the holy spirit calling that woman out seeing she wouldn't be left out and he the holy spirit he speaks every language and at the day of pentecost every language under heaven was gathered there and god spoke to them from his people in every dialect under the sun for it was god it was the holy spirit amen praise god so you understand what i'm saying brother sister i fear nothing you are to fear nothing you say oh oh these people that go into this country and these people are only speaking up that don't mean nothing you just preach the word and if god wants he'll just change your language whatever and you'll speak direct to them people and they'll understand you you don't have to have no worry about nothing anymore because the holy spirit will flow through you and bring his words to pass amen praise god we don't have no language barrier now do we with the holy ghost and you don't have language barrier it's just an immortal body don't understand that language or that dialect or that tongue but once you break into the holy spirit there in the language barrier you broke through every sound barrier you're brought to every veil you're brought through everything and you come into the presence of the living god hallelujah amen blessed be the name of the lord glory to god hallelujah amen amen hallelujah oh my to tell your friends when a believer is under the influence of the revelation of this message and they're speaking this message on the revelation it brings them they are speaking the new terms you know what i'm saying that you i want you to understand me because your mind is going to wrestle with the pentecostal uh portrayal that they've been given of what speaking in tongues is right you got to hear something some but listen as i've said to you before since i was just a young man the holy ghost showed me that casting out devils and the devil speaking in other towns and he said no that's not that's not the things i'm i'm telling you about that's the devil right and cast the devil out to prove it that that's the way it was you see but when god wants to use an individual that's been anointed by the holy ghost and have received the revelation of the word he can let that individual speak in any language or in any term whenever he wants and conversely he can cause you to understand any language right you can be right there and they're talking they're talking and like i did i'm hearing english it is plain as day i hear in english but when i start speaking in them to them they're in a shock because how do you know that you don't stop the language no i don't talk the language but i am hearing it i'm hearing it and that's the way god works amen hallelujah hallelujah so in your walk and in your ministry brothers sisters we don't have to fear nothing we don't have to wander at anything you don't have to before you go to japan or korea go and pick up a language book and start learning the language because you got to preach there and so the devil put all these things to be obstacles the man in the text five years to go learning this language of that language before he even goes and by time then the fire that was in him cooled off right you don't have to do that just go in the name of jesus christ under the holy spirit amen and god will use you for his glory amen so the new tongues of the elect is really the holy spirit himself speaking through them whenever he wills whenever he wants to manifest himself for his glory praise the lord and then it's going to leave us after a while because and i'm going to wind up now because you remember joseph was down in egypt how many knows the story of joseph down in egypt and when joseph was in egypt like oh god we are here in this world and everything else down here amongst all the people and everything else and the brethren came up because they wanted to get food from him you know there's something about us as a people a god who has really received this message i know everybody said they receive it but receive the revelation of the word that people they don't like what you're you're standing for and what you might be saying and this but yet they they want to come and talk to you they want to get food they want the spiritual food that you have yes right it's the same thing was happening with joseph in type right they brought his brethren came up to him amen to be able to buy food or or get food from him hallelujah and when he began talking to them they said we don't understand uh uh we don't understand of course joseph if he wanted to he could step down and talk to them in just a plain ordinary jewish language just like you if you want to you can talk to the jewel witness if you want and you step down to his level you can talk to whichever group you want you can step down but if you talk up here where you are we don't understand that we don't know what you're talking about we don't know this stuff here you're speaking about so so we don't understand that amen and the bible says and joseph spoke to them through an interpreter i want thank god for the holy spirit that we can still speak to uh our brothers or sisters our family or friends and speak to them by the holy spirit and let the holy spirit have his way amen praise god he spoke to them by an interpreter and make make no message and we know brother sister that the r is coming now when this thing is going back to israel and and joseph is going to have to talk to his brethren and you know all that we don't want to go into him calling little benjamin and and having to talk with him but um he he then will have to speak to them under the language that is now speaking to us and and when it goes to them they they're not going to understand it praise god but after a while through the interpreter they will begin to understand and as the prophet said the the trumpets to them is like the seals to us and when just like the seals broke to us it will have to break to them and uh when when seals break oh yes he's reminding me something here i missed the coat station here somewhere you can let me find it because he's talking about the seventh seal in respect to what we're talking about here amen yeah and and then so it'll break on them and they will begin to understand it just give me a minute and let me find this quotation here where he's talking about this on the seventh seal praise the lord hallelujah oh praise god i don't know how i went over that maybe he wanted to save that for us for the glory of god amen hallelujah seventh seal because he was talking about how you notice the seventh seal when it began to break on the people hallelujah that it didn't have anything said about it nothing was made known to the people whatsoever praise god hallelujah okay praise god i want you to notice and i'm going to close now this is a different day uh even my way of preaching the word or bringing the word to you i want you to notice that jesus omitted all teaching of that seventh seal it's not here watch he does it but goes right on by speaking parables now after that when john comes the seventh seal the last seal that seventh seal that's going to be a great thing and it's so great it's not even written see there's the unwritten word where a lot of people think you're talking over your head you don't know what you're talking about it's right there the seventh seal he said that one is not even written well how are you going to get it and it's not even written how are you going to understand it are you going to get anything about it but this is what you're saying the very nature the life the gene that is in you that's not written because that like in the little duck is going to pick it up that little duck is going to go right to it because they're mad for that that means they've come along that line hallelujah a great thing it's not even written right you see oh my john the revelation wanted to write it but the voice said don't write and there was silence in heaven there is not a written word about it amen how a praise god so how are you gonna get this revelation of the seventh seal by revelation only where you can get it it's by revelation everyone else are going to be stuck up in 4th 5th 6th they're stuck in the all there they're stuck in them ages so you know one two three four little wesley write down even into the last church age seventh church age pentecost prophet moses i will like as i was with moses i will be with you amen they haven't crossed the river yet but you see that's the point see but they don't understand all them other seals is direct direct prophets prophets prophets prophets prophets but when it comes down here the holy spirit is the only one could take you across the river only one that can take you into the capstone only one could put you under that divine revelation where with that revelation in your heart amen you're no more anything like what's out in the world empty songs religious sounds just making a lot of sounds and noise and shouting and singing to make up for your deficiencies and missing the real thing that you're supposed to have i just want to thank god for this little thought here and i trust has been a blessing to you in some way shape or form praise god if you go back and read some of those things that i've read because i don't want to read all those things one after the other [Music] paul speaking in first corinthians 13 no i have not charity do i have not charity amen you haven't gotten in there you you haven't gotten in there you see you you begin to speak from in the ark door when when the holy spirit has come to you like that you're you're speaking from inside that capstone and when you do that then it has a ring to it it has a richness to it something that holds you but when you're not there and you're speaking from one these agents you become a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol even though it's the same word same word but it becomes a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol thank god for his word and his promise pray for me as i pray for you heavenly father we thank you as our worship leader and the musicians singers come may the holy spirit bless us and anoint us everyone as we come together in the name of the lord jesus christ for your glory and honor we thank you for your word we thank you for this new language that we can speak in not another tongue or another strange language like the pentecostal thing but speaking the same english language of this message under divine revelation that father is our new tongue and when we speak it father glory to god father it brings out the effulgence of your glory and speak of all the wonderful works of god we give you praise honor and glory in jesus name amen and amen praise the lord god bless you now we're going to be having because i've been asked um my brother hutchinson will be here and he will be ordaining a minister here next sunday no doubt we'll have our service
