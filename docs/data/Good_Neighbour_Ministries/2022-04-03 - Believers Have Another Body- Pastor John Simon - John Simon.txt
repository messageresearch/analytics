for by uh brother desmond he was given up by the doctors but healed by the power of god and god allowed him to receive the message get baptized become a believer start walking in the word live for a few months after and then he died and now his two daughters which are women working and stuff like that and god has struck their hearts and so they called up brother desmond and said brother what our father had and what was in him and you know it's really touched us and we really want to give our lives over so he'll be baptizing them here next week by the grace of god both of them [Music] and this is what the book of acts is and the lord added to the church amen such as should be saved see god adding to the church and we give him praise honor and glory we thank god for every one of you here and i'll go to the word because once i get talking on this and it curse me a bit um now um we'll go to first thessalonians chapter 4 reading from verses 13 to 18. rejoice praise the lord wonderful worship and wonderful preparation of hearts to receive the word of god as i believe you'll receive it this morning okay if that's up there on the screen okay we'll read it from the scriptures in here but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the ear and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words gracious heavenly father thank you for the reading of your word and now we receive the bread of life in jesus name amen god bless you please be seated praise god hallelujah amen glory be to god isn't the lord wonderful indeed amen amen we've given all the praise all the honor on all the glory for he's the same yesterday today and forever praise god i'm just pausing here just to uh you know get myself in a certain direction here we want to talk about uh several things we will speak about but um you know you have another body right the bible tells us that but we have another body and we will talk a little bit about that we will talk a little bit about the uh great um coming of the lord we'll talk um a bit about the uh body change praise the lord uh we'll touch on these things for god's glory and we pray that the holy spirit will help us amen glory be to god well first of all i want you to know of course the coming of the lord is a process right it's a process um to be born again is also a process you see when we look at all these things we understand it's all of the rapture is a process now i want to see the trend there god is changing our thinking and thoughts from the denominational or systems the way of the systems how they think uh of uh the rapture is just an event that's gonna happen on one day right um the the new birth is just an event on a certain day you got born again see the holy spirit has been and is changing our thoughts from the world to his thoughts or his way of thinking or how he is seeing it and telling it to us and we have been going through that change not even realizing it but that change has been taking place by the grace of god so we thank god for that wonderful uh process and that wonderful change that we have been going through and still are going through by the grace of god now i'm going to have to jump over certain things because this message will not take just a day i can't this is just not possible so we give him all the glory and all the praise for what he has done now i want you to know that when we look in the scripture here it tells us here let me stop back here again i still haven't really gotten into uh what praise the lord i want you to understand here that um the coming of the lord as as i have said is a process and we have and people have had the totally wrong idea of what the coming of the lord is and what it is about right now we find in the scriptures the bible tells us behold he cometh with clouds now brother coating brother branham now he is coming with clouds but what kind of clouds clouds of glory not one of these rain clouds that we you know we thinking of clouds passing of our heads see not not even a sunder cloud thunderhead but clouds of glory you you'll watch what kind of a cloud that he was uncovered with when peter and them saw him on the mount transfiguration he was covered in a bright shining cloud overshadowed him he was enshrouded with that kind of cloud the power of god now when the meetings he had his meetings and it really became very powerful then he'll stop and say oh my i i can see it's milky in here it's cloudy now amen so he's saying the clouds of the power of god hallelujah amen so he's trying to tell us when they read about the coming of the lord with clouds they're thinking of these kinds of clouds but he's telling us no the clouds he's talking about is the clouds of the power of god the power of god that uh let you see and receive this revelation right so you're gonna meet the lord in those clouds of power and of revelation that are uh meant for you now let me always say this just like we say the rapture is a process but it's gonna end the process of that rapture is gonna end that's what they want to call the rapture the end of it right and the same thing any one of those processes like the baptism they're not seeing it all the way that's from the foundations they're looking at it when it comes down to the end and you you're born again on this certain certain day but no you had to be born again it's the same way he's talking now about these clouds of glory bringing to you the revelation of the word of god hallelujah praise god and has brought this word of the word of god to you being and confessed with this cloud of witnesses what witnesses from the word hallelujah the word has been witnessing to you and revealing to you these things praise god it's it's not like you walked in the streets of jerusalem and you met abraham and you met this one and then they witnessed to you but you are meeting that witness in the world praise god we'll go further later but praise the lord because god has quickened you and raised you from the dead like he did them on the in the old testament and they met the others in the streets we are meeting the thing in the world and is speaking to us and revealing the word to us in this day and in this hour in which we live praise the lord hallelujah amen so we thank god for that hallelujah see oh my see the day that we are living in amen from this day we live when there is nothing no hopes left but the coming of the lord that's the revelation of jesus christ then we go here where he talks about job job was on the great strain like we are in this age and this time we are on the great strain and the devil is bringing the pressure down on your mind on your body on your family on your everything is bringing the pressure down that's why the prophet said only our eagles can be able to take that kind of pressure [Music] and they even use that pressure to rise up hallelujah on wings like eagles to the glory of god that if you're a hawk you're busted up amen praise the lord i'm glad for all of those those of you who are here and i give him glory for that amen now thank god now remember even his own wife turned against him see my god think of it and he had to tell her you talk as a foolish woman hallelujah amen you speak like a foolish woman now he says to her i come in this world without anything naked and i'll go out the same way and i'll still say blessed be the name of the lord if you're never that rich if you never got lofty in society if your name never went around the world i came with nothing i'm going with nothing but my character that come from god and i shall glory to god hallelujah thank you for what you've done for me amen remember think of it this man sitting out there with boils on him his kids all dead with poverty was a very the richest man of his day and all of a sudden he comes down to poverty his friends all turned against him even his church members turned against him and everything else and there he had to sit in an ash pile scraping himself what a miserable wretch that was none of this still never mind what happened he held to god's word remember he held to god's word why because he was an eagle why are you going to hold to the word you're not eager because you're an elected seed of the living god amen you all to god's holy word amen oh my think of it the sky spilled back the thunder's roared and he said i know my redeem olivia and at the last days look at the time when he's to see it at the last days he'll stand up on this earth hallelujah praise god and though the skin worms have destroyed this body bones and all the quickening power will still be in me hallelujah and i will see god for myself whom i shall see amen for myself and not another my eyes shall behold him praise be to god that's right amen brother bran speaking now though after my reigns be consumed skin worms remember skin worms don't come from somewhere else and then come to you the worm is already in your skin death working in this natural body amen did you notice if they put you into a coffin keep it airtight the bugs will still eat you up right see cause they're in you and so we can say you are just a bunch of bugs to begin with on the inside of your body though this skin worms destroys my flesh amen or my body yet in my flesh so he's speaking of two flesh he said no the skin worms destroy my body my flesh yet in my flesh i'll see god i want to tell you you have another body in the first body no man shall see god and live but in this next body i shall see him for myself praise god one is of the flesh and one of the spirit given by the living god hallelujah and on the resurrection morning hallelujah let's go to matthew he says 27 51-53 after he was resurrected from the dead now let me stop here for a minute because it keep coming to me while i'm talking there that i explained to you the last days you see when job said i shall see him for myself and these different ones like it's taking me back again because remember from the beginning enoch saw him abraham saw him and then job is now saying i shall see him for myself you realize that praise god and you know jesus said it abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad praise god enoch saw the coming of the lord jude i believe it's 14 where he said and jude said the lord commit yes he's cometh with thousands of his saints so job saw the coming of the lord hallelujah praise god now you understand that when you say last days the last days to them pay tracks back there and their rapture just like we're looking for a rapture now but their last days was when jesus came and you see paul when he's speaking now and he's talking he believed that his last days were right then the rapture was going to take place any moment at that time but you see the church ages hasn't played out they're just about they just finished and just about to take the whole thing up so i want you to realize this that uh job is saying he's gonna see him for himself but his last day and his rapture is when he saw him in this old testament when he was raised up that's when they all saw him amen praise god and that's what the prophet is trying to point us to by going to uh matthew 27 51 he suddenly moved from job and he's gone to matthew talking about the old testament saints but he's talking in the context that job says i shall see him for myself abraham see him enoch see him and here he says remember all them testament sins and i say this now that's claim they saw him and they're going to see him are now afforded the opportunity to see him for themselves because the bible says that many of them that slept in the dust of the earth come out to them graves entered in the city and appeared to marry walking with him quickening fire was upon them power upon them powering the bones of elijah when there was no more bones still that power was on job even when he wasn't a spoonful of dust left of his body the quick empire was still there upon him that spirit raised him up and if this spirit that raised jesus christ from the dead dwelling you he will do the same thing and quicken your mortal body even there's no just left whatsoever he'll raise up your mortal body amen oh my oh my you said oh i wish i lived back there like that when you see no he says you are living now in a better time amen put down this scripture now he's gone from that scripture to first thessalonians 4 16 this saints them that sleep in christ god will bring with him you see you see them saints in the grave that are resting like elisha was resting see some of them will be quickened like elijah was and some will be taken from in the grave they will go for the bible tells us the trumpet of the lord shall sound and the dead and christ shall rise first and we which alive and remain shall be caught up hallelujah to be with the lord in the air in the clouds amen the quickening part do you see it he says quickening power on the living quickening power on the dead the quickening power was represented in voters and prophets the power of god elisha elijah don't you see even their names the male the female the bride the groom one of them mr jesus the other misses jesus oh my him he and she there see it was representing that because you see any board when it's ready to take its flight it needs them two wings that's right are you thinking you're spiritual here amen any bird ready to take its rapture it's got to have two wings it can't leave with one wing is that right they can't just leave with one wing you gotta leave with both wings right oh my see because that balances itself see now the church is represented right there in them two prophets for we which allah are alive and remain at the coming of the lord shall not hinder them which are asleep the living and the dead for the trumpet of god shall sound and then both wings shall come together amen old testament new testament hallelujah both wings will come together living and the dead the quickening power still lives today remember now you see we we are quickened to see these things wow watch the quickening power of it this day what it does we are quickened to see this day praise god oh my so in these last days when we are seeing this quickening power upon us he even quicken power to see the sick healed quickening power to seeing miracles among us hallelujah like it was in them early days hallelujah making the sick well and visions and like that what he is saying here the quickening power brought healing brought all kinds of miracles amongst them visions and discernments and everything but the quickening power is now here under the power of the turtle to quicken you and anoint you to see hallelujah now to go back i can't go back to all those things the building of the body which i've preached on many times right up through he says it comes right up until it gets to the seeing edge where the eyes now have to see what's there praise god and above the eyes then what is there he says nothing moving anymore amen no works nothing nothing moving he says all that's left is the mind the brain the mind and so that the seeing takes you into the mind amen the seeing takes you into the brain hallelujah the seeing takes you into the thoughts of god brings you into that dimension of that place where you're in him by the power of his holy spirit quickening power did that he's trying to tell you if it did that for every age manifested vindicated itself now it's come again but it's now come to make you see hallelujah not them kind of meetings like they used to have back there and their god sent god blessed just very good wonderful but that's not the day we're living in not moses not no i'm not luther not wesley not pentecost not the seventh church age but we are in this eighth day under the quickening power of the holy spirit hallelujah but oh my by which we have been caught up in the clouds of believers that have on the clouds of witnesses of the word that has gone before us glory be to his marvelous name hallelujah oh my so job was quickened to see him abraham quickened to see him he not quickened to see him you are being quickened right now to see him you're seeing him in the world so like the prophet says in other place so when when he appears before you you're already seeing him it's not going to be a startling thing where he's gonna have to do like the angels fear not no because you're seeing him already [Applause] you're getting to see him and to know him so when that person stands visible before you you're ready to welcome him bring back the king and praise his holy name lord of god hallelujah amen praise god hallelujah oh my you see so you got that job uh stop not this flesh i'm not gonna see him in this flesh but in my flesh i still want to see god oh praise god forevermore hallelujah i want you to know the fullness of the word listen what he go what's the next scripture now remember when this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have another waiting if this tabula earthly tabernacle or body be dissolved we have another body waiting praise god hallelujah amen now you remember when he made all the statements when a when a baby is born he says when that child is born that little angel just waits for its body to be formed and when it's ready that angel that body goes and the angel enters that body amen hallelujah oh praise god it's the opposite way when you break out from this natural body then you say that man he says is now a spirit babe like us like in christ and this soul that leaves this body now goes to enter into a body that was prepared for you before the foundation of the world hallelujah lord this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting you believe that you see remember how peter was in jail hallelujah oh my but you see they prayed and they waited trusting god will open the prison doors and set him free but you know the story when peter turned up at the door they believe it was his ghost right he says you see because somehow peter huddle had entered into his angel you see he had god allowed him to enter into his theophany why you could walk out of the prison is that right prison bars are nothing couldn't hold him because he said that's the body which you you can't shake hands you don't shake hands with that it has no answer shake it's in the image of a man you see it's in the image of a man but it's a theophany oh my she looked and what she saw was peter standing there because that body is in the image of a man hallelujah you see peter was delivered by that angel his angel praise the lord praise god hallelujah oh my hebrews chapter 3 that is in and then he says for when a man is born again from heaven he becomes a spirit babe in christ hallelujah and when this robe of flesh he drops it and it's dropped this is a natural body then uh a theophany comes a body not made with hands neither born of woman that we all go to hallelujah when i say we all true believers elected saints we go to that body that's why that that that's kept saying don't don't live like you got no hope you're not gonna die like a sinner and just turn to dust in a grave somewhere like that but you got hope when you live here you go into another body you're going to a better body one that don't know nothing about pain don't know nothing about sickness and don't know nothing of the death it can't it doesn't know that and you're leaving this one and go to that one you have another body [Applause] hallelujah oh praise god and that you see that body not made with hands that body returns back and picks up the glorified body amen that's the reason jesus went to hell when he died and priests took them souls that were in prison back into that theophany or how marvelous in other words the body of christ even he though he was the head when he turned or was resurrected back into his theophonic state he came and picked up his body right he wasn't talking about just this jesus body but all those old testament changed that was there that one came and picked this one up and take them out of here for the grace of god hallelujah oh my saw the same spirit of the living god amen my friends in this hour and in this day will pick up the rest of his body that's right here upon the face of the earth it's already picking it up amen it's already picking it up one by one regain the portal picking it up one by one bringing it all together for his glory amen second corinthians right five one if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved he went back to that this earthly tabernacle you see we have another one waiting now you see we have by past that one your theophany you bypass that one see and you come straight from god as an attribute are you listening amen to be come flesh to be tempted and tested by sin hallelujah oh my why that he might display to the devil and the world his attributes displaying his power and his glory right on the face of the earth in the middle of all the sin and the evil living holy in the midst of babylon living righteous in the midst of it try testing let me say what he says here or think of it and when this testing of his word is over see then we are taken up to this body he just said you by pasta theophany you come down here as an attribute or a part of the word of god but when this testing of this word that's down here on the earth is over amen hallelujah then we we are taken up to this to your funny body that was prepared for us when before he says for for the foundations of the world hallelujah oh praise god it is the word there that we skipped to come right down here so that we could be tempted and tested you see and if we had come through that there would have been no temptation see we don't know all things already that's the reason jesus knew all things see because he was the word before he was flesh and then he come down here to be the word but you bypass the theophany and come down here in flesh to be tested tried god sent us down here deliberately purposely because he had confidence in you they're gonna go down they're gonna accomplish the mission and then i can bring them all back by my grace amen hallelujah so god sent you down here and now you're in the middle of a sealed mission sealed orders glory god hallelujah oh my and you're fulfilling your mission on the power of god and when it's all over he says he catches them up and he brings them back up back to that body that they should have had from the very beginning that they're fighting you'll bypass it man how he brings you right back to it oh praise god hallelujah see if we had to come through that body there there'd be no temptation we would have known all things that's the reason jesus knew all things because he was the word before he was fleshed then he become the word here we are formed by to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word predestinated since the very beginning when you started your journey amen oh my see you started your journey that spark of life that was in you that you have in you from the beginning when you started that journey you can't remember it you may not remember it but when you come here you just join church i say you come here you joined this church you joined that church you tried this you tried that and nothing seemed to satisfy you but one day you just recognized this that's all he said there he says that's all you you just recognize this you're going around all the time but once you got this man why because you're predestinated to see only the world no matter what else come around you you you might catch your attention for a while but but it can't satisfy you forever you're gonna recognize something is off here something is wrong here but once you saw this you don't have to go years to find out if it's right something in here tells you that's right that's just the lord that's the word of god hallelujah i recognize it hallelujah why you come from there you're a part of that the man comes back the female joint together glory god hallelujah they lose the they put a male mart somewhere i think in new york city and lose the female in new york city and lose the mail from somewhere over here scientists making a test they said it maybe took days but after a while fluttering on the window is the husband knocking amen knocking trying to get in where his wife was and that's what's been happening jesus been knocking at the church doors trying to come in hallelujah to bring us back where we come from you're not creatures of time the prophet said you come from eternity you're going back to eternity come from the very mind of god you return back to the mind of god hallelujah you're eternal beings just trapped in a body called time that's all body to your body limits you the body limits you at a certain time your body limits you here different things but you are now recognizing who you really are just trapped in this body here praise god hallelujah amen my goodness think of it many of you can't remember it but one day that's all you just recognize it aren't you glad you recognized hallelujah and what that recognizes does that recognition it frees you from the confinement of this prison that you're in that they tried to put you in and uh you know you become like john the revelator they put you on a little island but you've gone all all over the place right then you're gone in the future you gone you got you're writing all kinds of things because you're gone everywhere amen hallelujah praise be to god oh he says here thank god hallelujah oh my think of it three or four yes that's the first of all that quote comes from who is this melchizedek and i'm taking the time to say it so that you can go look it up afterwards now think of this there a king got in trouble before the blood of jesus was shed he was in paradise and the witch of endor called for somebody to come and to console saul and the witch saw that him standing there and she said i see god raising up out of the earth and after that man that samuel is talking about the prophet have been dead buried and rotted away in a grave yet here he was standing with his prophet's robes on and was still a prophet and he said why did you call me out of my rest sing you are an enemy of god watch him prophesy tomorrow night by this time you will be with me that which is going to be dead for what she did but nevertheless say this this is this whatever to solve amen see he was still a prophet though he was gone from that body but he had come back here and was now a part of that word and had entered into that flesh the theophany right he had then so he looked the same it don't change look the same praise god but it's not the same flesh all flesh paul said it's not the same flesh he says bodies terrestrial bodies this then we body celestial amen see wonderful isn't it wonderful praise be to god hallelujah oh my think of it you see he had entered into the geophony which was the word and that's where we all as believers go to when we are turned around from here praise god you come on your journey you come to the end and he turns you right back to go back home he said when you get turned around from here we all going back to that that we bypass and we go right back into that theophany whether you're alive you're going you're you're going to be caught up into it if you're dead you're going to be quickened and raised up into it but you're going back to it [Applause] you've got another body you've got another body praise peter god hallelujah oh my then in that form oh my then you see he said then the veil is lifted you see you are the word when you enter into there just like a little baby as i said a while ago oh praise god praise god for the opening of these seals oh to know these things he says praise god hallelujah don't you praise him for the opening of the seals the opening up of the world that we could even speak these things now amen i'm not speaking here like i know it all like i knew or i know or no no no it doesn't make me any better than you it just makes me think thank god you open my eyes to see thank god you reveal these things to me they're so billions in the world but yet father you brought me in that number oh praise god hallelujah i'm in that number and i praise god for it not by my choosing not by my glory and say lord i make you my choice no but him making me his choice amen not some uh lady or church coming up to me and say i choose you i've had that happen before you were there he was there with me in grenada ladies selling our fish and then turner oh my you are i won't talk about it you can ask them quietly and explain to you what that is about but praise god but bring it a little higher i've had the african methodist episcopal church want to make me one of their bishops not the ordinary bishop one that have six seven eight churches under you right away about the methodist church uh i want to do the same thing give you a whole bunch of churches right oh my but that's not the way it is amen it's him making his choice you're not choosing me he chose you amen praise god hallelujah he said you didn't choose me i chose you amen blessed be the name of the living god oh praise god hallelujah oh somebody keep a watch on that clock for me amen praise god hallelujah amen glory to god i'm so glad that the coming of the lord is a process and i'm glad the rapture is a process and i'm glad the body change is a process even in this message the misinterpretations the misunderstanding they're written for a certain day when the body gonna suddenly change and you are now by god's power to transform you're in the process of the change i don't care how old my body look on this outside nobody said amen i don't care how flabby my skin becomes and how much the wrinkles are setting to me why it is sooner i'm gonna get out of here to get in the other one so this don't scare me hallelujah this makes me rejoice i'm getting out to hear what the person it was the opposite when you think like god you're not worried about these kinds of things you're tall you're short you're big you're fat you're fine you know what's not all of that about that ain't got nothing to do with it amen you're leaving this and you're going to that all this is a temporary place you're passing through that right you think when you're in the desert and or you're up north and you're cold and you're dying of frost and cold in some of these icicle churches and you come out there and you and you get you'll find yourself in a little a little structure or a fishing rod or something you're going to complain this ain't got 10 rooms this is not big enough you don't have heating you're so glad to have a place you don't care how the place look hey man because when you get rescued and you're out there there you're going to your real home praise god oh praise god i've got to prepare a place for you that where i am you may be also that you might have a body like his own glorious body that you might walk out of this world and walk into that room oh praise god hallelujah oh my glory to god hallelujah amen think of it coming down from salem a king coming down from salem well you know salem is just a short for jerusalem right hallelujah a king coming down from salem met abraham coming from the slaughter of them kings oh my praise god the overcomer oh my god the king come to meet the overcomers who have slaughtered the king taste king touch king smell slaughter them five kings die out to himself living by the word of the living god amen praise god and the king come out to meet you and say welcome my good and faithful servant enter into the choice of your lord you're overcome praise god hallelujah amen your king come to meet him yes sir oh my think of this now that king though have no father that king had no mother that king had no beginning of days eternal no ending of his life who then did abraham really meet now think this person didn't have a father he didn't have no mother he never had a time when he even began he he never has a time when he will end and so that same king has to be still living today amen praise god oh my you see it was that theophany that the son of god right that jerusalem which is above and abraham being blessed was searching to find that place find that city whose builder and maker was god he wandered about there wandered about in sheepskins gold skins everything destitute wandering seeking some kind of a natural city like like i just explained to you they're looking for a lot of these natural things we call the system propagate that until it's fixated even to some people in the message they're still thinking on that plane but we come to be caught up higher to a higher dimension of the world where we can see clearly these things what god is saying to us praise god hallelujah see oh my and he met the king of that salem coming down and he paid him a tent of all his spoils that's him oh praise god that was him praise god hallelujah now remember abraham's seed will meet him as abraham did praise god abraham met that same king of salem praise god amen break of it praise god see now notice again he says here that's hebrews chapter one abra melchizedek went to meet abraham before abraham got back home see he had to meet him do you see a beautiful type we have in there melchizedek meeting abraham before he got back home but after the battle look at the type amen melchizedek the word revealing itself to believer meeting the elected faith seed of abraham praise god after the battle and meet them before they go back home and it's happening here again history is repeating itself god has come back in time amen the seals are upon he came back under that seventh shield he missed abraham's fat seed who was abraham's fat seed rejoice to see the world rejoice to see the revelation rejoice to see his day amen oh my my my glory be to god hallelujah amen oh praise god don't you see what it says we will meet jesus now he's changed now from talking about the shadow over there and he come back to the original he says now don't you see what's that's pointing to we meet jesus in the air and we meet him before we go back home praise god that's right ii thessalonians tells us we meet him in the air what a beautiful type of rebecca means meeting isaac in the field in the cool of the day but here it says we meet him in the air right oh my for we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet shell of god shall sound the dead in christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet the lord in the air perfect all these times therefore if you had died still calling if you have entered if you have died and entered already into that theophany what happens you see that theophany comes to the earth and picks up that body the redeemed body that person is now redeemed so it comes to pick up the redeemed body not that's the sinful but he said but it looked the same the people wouldn't know that you underwent a change a body change right see it comes to pick up that redeem body but if you are here a man in the hair in the air what the air be in that is talking about if you are here still you are here and you are in the air then you are alive and you take the body to meet the theophany see you take this redeemed body that you're living in to meet your theophany there you are that's what it is you are caught up to meet the lord in the air praise god you understand i've told you before you're already being caught up in the revelation you are already being caught up in the clouds of witnesses the word witnessing back to you back to you back to you it's tying everything together and showing you the fullness of the word of god and you're meeting the lord now in the air of the world hallelujah you're meeting him in this atmosphere that you're in here in the world you're meeting him scripturally now in heavenly places in christ you're meeting him in heavenly places oh praise god don't let me go down a list of those heavenly places that you're meeting him in praise god amen praise god glory to god no that's what it is you meet him in the air now can you see plainly the complete secret of your lives can't you see clearly your journey from life to death oh my where are we and can't you see where we go after we die oh praise god also predestinated predestination comes into plain view right here praise god hallelujah aren't you glad that god had this all a plan before the foundation of the world that is why we can say blessed are sure not because you are praying at the altar but brother branham said your anchor holes in the rock of ages up in heaven doesn't matter what storms he says come down here and the boat can flip this way go that way the mass break off amen doesn't matter what you know you are tied to the haven of rest hallelujah lord of god you're going back where you come from hallelujah praise god oh my and if yours that is from who is this melchizedek if your spirit that is in you is reckoned dead and you are anointed with the life of christ upon you amen think of it romans 8 11 says if that spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells within you it will also quicken hallelujah your mortal body amen and i was in a nice way let me say that spirit already quickened your soul quicken your spiritual being already would it finish the job and quitting your mortal wants also amen god works in trees you don't just do one and leave it like that he started the quickness already and all that's left is to click on your body and take that thing back where it comes from into the theophany where it came from amen will he not also quicken your mortal body with that same life same powers same beneficiaries that he had here on earth or mine he redeemed you he redeemed you and i want you to remember this redeem you a seed that was already foreknown by god and name was already on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world oh that gospel light of the resurrection amen the confirmation of the word how did we know that he was christ now i will pause there because i'm going to come back to some of these things from another way amen he says and now that gospel light of the resurrection has shone upon you he's nicely telling you from the moment you received the first revelation your resurrection started it started with the revelation of the word and you caught it and the moment you caught it your resurrection started praise god he says other places you know some of those quotes he says you are already resurrected he says potentially we are ready praise god because you're still in the process lord of god hallelujah he raised you up above sin he raised you up above the world hallelujah amen oh praise god the gospel light of the resurrection is the confirmation of that word confirmed you're a son a daughter a child of god confirms you are a seed confirmed that you are in that body that number how did we know that he was in christ because he proved what he talked about how will i know the message of this hour because god proves what he promised and he talks about it hallelujah and he talks about it you see he just leave these things like that but he talks about it to you amen and you want to know why is he talking to him or horror that person they're just as good as i i love them they're wonderful wonderful people but they're still he's not talking to them like he's talking to you are you hearing it so clearly wonderful praise god forevermore i think i'm gonna start winding this up here praise god hallelujah how will i know see that is the identification that you are a beneficiary hallelujah that god has come and he starts talking to you that makes your beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves that he talked about what he promised to do in christ he proved on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of moses he proved it in enoch he proved it all them apostles he proved it and now in this day he proves what he said because they are part of that seed that was already represented in the book of life that he came to redeem back to god oh what a message for this hour oh what a message aren't you happy today praise the lord look i'm going to stop right here because we're going to go into continue to go into certain things praise the lord and i'm sure that god will lift us all up where we belong and bless us in every possible way praise god hallelujah how many showers i was talking about amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god oh praise god okay don't bother giving me the attitude oh i knew that already so you know you can give me that kind of look right he's not
