[0:00] was in when Jesus decided to intervene
[0:02] in my life I had problems I had drug
[0:04] addictions I had Financial issues I had
[0:07] all kinds of situations around my life
[0:09] and uh God just chose to intercede at
[0:13] that particular time in my life you know
[0:16] a lot of people say oh you know you
[0:18] needed God because you know you were
[0:20] going through some bad times and you
[0:22] know that's why you you you took a hold
[0:24] of God and you let that be your clutch
[0:28] you know and your way of of uh you know
[0:30] uh saying and justifying that this is
[0:33] how you know you got out of your
[0:35] problems and your trouble no no no no
[0:37] it's not the way it works okay there's a
[0:40] lot of people that will go to rehab
[0:42] centers and they do work some of them
[0:45] work some of them don't it's as simple
[0:48] as that I'm not going to turn around and
[0:50] say you know this works and that doesn't
[0:52] work and this works and that doesn't
[0:54] work no I'm just going to tell you my
[0:57] experience my experience was not because
[1:00] I uh went to a rehabilitation Church on
[1:06] Winona it wasn't a Little White Church
[1:09] on in Winona known as a rehab center a
[1:12] lot of people want to call churches
[1:14] rehab centers I'm saying churches are a
[1:17] good thing everybody needs to belong and
[1:21] to worship because it's in you to
[1:23] worship something but it's another thing
[1:25] when God comes to you when God comes to
[1:29] you because he has a plan for you
[1:31] because he has a a purpose for your life
[1:34] because you're not just another ordinary
[1:36] individual out in the world you are a
[1:39] son or a daughter of God by election in
[1:42] the back mind of God from before the
[1:45] foundations of the world and you are
[1:48] being now expressed and manifested in
[1:51] this day as a as a an actual attribute
[1:55] of God you are the word being manifested
[1:59] and made flesh
[2:00] to the people of this
[2:03] 2023 year and and this time and this
[2:07] season you are God's interpretation of
[2:10] his word there's a big difference
[2:12] between just being a churchgoer and
[2:15] being the
[2:17] word you are the word because you can
[2:20] see yourself in the word and here now
[2:22] you you look and you know Peter was just
[2:24] an ordinary man I was an ordinary man
[2:27] you're an ordinary woman you were just
[2:29] somebody that was brought up in a
[2:31] certain land and you ended up here in
[2:33] Canada and now you ended up here in this
[2:35] church and you ended up under this
[2:37] ministry and you're now finding yourself
[2:40] by Revelation in the body of Christ the
[2:43] mystical body of Jesus Christ not just
[2:46] good neighbor Ministries this is just a
[2:49] church it's a church building like any
[2:51] other church out there but what gathers
[2:53] in this place every Sunday every
[2:55] Wednesday when we come together there's
[2:58] a supernatural God that comes and and
[3:01] possesses the ministry and starts to
[3:04] speak to our lives and makes his word
[3:06] real to us it's a reality it's not just
[3:09] a a tradition it's not oh I got to go to
[3:12] church so that I can be seen oh no
[3:15] that's not what it is this is going to
[3:17] meet God where God can speak to you lip
[3:20] to ear and discern your needs and and
[3:23] change your life and and work on your
[3:25] character and take away the things that
[3:28] that that that you know like we talked
[3:30] about on Wednesday night we have
[3:31] preconceptions and we have things in our
[3:34] lives that that that we filter our lives
[3:36] through and we think that oh well I was
[3:38] brought up in this way and I was taught
[3:40] this way and you know I've got these bad
[3:43] experiences in my life and and it was a
[3:45] bad experience and now I'm a miserable
[3:48] person most of the time that's just who
[3:50] I am not when Christ comes amen Peter
[3:54] was a miserable person Peter had a had a
[3:57] fiery uh uh temper
[4:00] amen praise God but God was going to use
[4:03] that fire that was in him to go and
[4:06] preach to the Gentiles amen praise God
[4:08] God was going to use that that that
[4:10] characteristic that's in you to be a
[4:13] testimony and to be a a living uh word
[4:16] in your day and God is going to use your
[4:19] character the way that God designed you
[4:21] but he's gonna he's gonna he's gonna
[4:23] mold you and shape you into something
[4:26] that you are going to be proud of to
[4:28] know that you're a part of God's economy
[4:30] amen praise God he was just like anybody
[4:33] else having financial problems
[4:36] relationship problems he was having
[4:38] trouble with his wife there she was
[4:40] getting tired of you know uh all the the
[4:42] the excuses and all the lies because
[4:45] he'd be out late at night maybe he'd be
[4:47] trying to gamble his money back or
[4:49] trying to make a way to you know somehow
[4:51] because he just wasn't doing well at
[4:53] fishing you see but God had designed him
[4:56] to be a fisherman amen because God had
[4:59] different plans for him down the road
[5:01] you can look back in your life and you
[5:03] can look at certain characteristics in
[5:04] your life uh how God you know designed
[5:07] you you know I hear my wife say a lot of
[5:09] times to me you know she goes man you
[5:11] know all you thought about was money all
[5:14] you thought about was becoming rich All
[5:16] you thought about was you know like
[5:18] being successful I
[5:20] said that's just who I was that's the
[5:24] desire that was in my
[5:25] heart now I want to be successful I want
[5:30] to be
[5:31] financially free and I want it all for
[5:34] one purpose for the glory of God so that
[5:38] something can happen that that if God
[5:40] wants to use me financially if God wants
[5:43] to use you financially if God wants to
[5:45] move millions of dollars through you for
[5:48] whatever purpose as long as you've come
[5:50] into your position as a son or a
[5:53] daughter of God God can give you what is
[5:57] yours God can bless you financially God
[6:00] can do with you what he wants because he
[6:02] knows now the character is the right
[6:05] kind of character but God doesn't always
[6:09] bless everybody in the same way you see
[6:12] some people you know they get into their
[6:13] mind oh you know I got so much
[6:16] Revelation on Prosperity I should be I
[6:18] should be one of the rich ones in the
[6:22] church that's not the way it
[6:24] works God doesn't work that way God
[6:27] gives a portion of faith to each and
[6:30] every one and so some will just
[6:33] naturally have the ability to prosper
[6:36] financially so that they can bless the
[6:38] kingdom of God because God knows they
[6:40] got a revelation on it other people got
[6:43] a revelation on uh big houses and and
[6:46] and fancy cars and and and just luxury
[6:50] all around them and and that's that's
[6:52] their motive that's their desire and
[6:54] that's their purpose and God is not
[6:56] interested in
[6:58] that he's not interested in that he's
[7:01] interested in the vision that he's
[7:03] placed in
[7:04] you to prosper the kingdom of God God
[7:08] doesn't need my money God doesn't need
[7:11] your money God didn't need to get into
[7:15] Peter's
[7:16] boat God didn't need oh Peter I need you
[7:20] to bring me out a little bit further out
[7:22] into the water because this way the
[7:24] people will be able to hear me better
[7:26] which that makes sense right because you
[7:27] know you go out there's a crowd and
[7:29] everything else so Peter I I need I need
[7:32] your boat to take me out
[7:35] there I can I can show you a scripture
[7:37] that says Jesus walked on the
[7:40] water he didn't need the
[7:43] boat but he needed Peter he had an he
[7:47] had an appointment with Peter he had an
[7:49] appointment with you he had an
[7:51] appointment with me he had a purpose in
[7:54] calling us and so when God's going to do
[7:57] something he's got a purpose purpose and
[7:59] a plan and he knows everything that he
[8:02] needs to put into your life so that when
[8:05] the time comes that you recognize your
[8:09] calling get into your position God can
[8:12] bless you and bless the body hallelujah
[8:17] praise God forever
[8:18] more but you know sometimes the Lord
[8:21] will allow us to get into some pretty
[8:23] low places to get our attention he'll
[8:26] allow us to fall into unbelief because
[8:29] you know we're still human right you got
[8:31] to remember there was Simon and then
[8:34] there was
[8:35] Peter you see each and every one of us
[8:39] there's there's there's there's you and
[8:41] then there's the attribute of God God's
[8:44] dealing with the attribute and the
[8:47] attribute is dealing with your flesh
[8:49] because it's at enemity with God right
[8:52] your your attribute is God by the way
[8:55] the portion of God that you are as a son
[8:58] is actually a part of God and so when
[9:01] your flesh is fighting up and it doesn't
[9:05] want to go to church it doesn't want to
[9:07] give it doesn't want to be there to help
[9:10] when the when the when the church is
[9:11] being cleaned when your flesh is
[9:14] fighting up in those areas it's because
[9:17] it's rebelling against God it's as
[9:21] simple as that you're rebelling in your
[9:24] spirit you you don't understand why you
[9:27] know you've got this this this miserable
[9:30] kind of attitude sometimes and why you
[9:33] you know you're you're you're nice one
[9:34] day and the next day you're not and then
[9:37] you know you're you're struggling one
[9:39] day the next day you're you're free it's
[9:41] because you are in this battle you're in
[9:44] this great battle brother Bram said it
[9:46] was the greatest battle that you'll ever
[9:48] fight and that battle is against
[9:51] yourself it's against this human element
[9:54] that you struggle with every single day
[9:56] gets tired and gets upset and has has to
[9:59] deal with all kinds of situations amen
[10:02] so God knows that there's there's Simon
[10:05] and then he called him Peter because now
[10:07] he was calling the real attribute now he
[10:10] was now he was going deeper now he was
[10:12] going to the to to the to the place
[10:14] where okay I'm gonna I'm gonna Place him
[10:16] now I'm going to show him so God had to
[10:18] do something Supernatural around Peter's
[10:21] life in order to catch his attention and
[10:24] I'll tell you something God will do
[10:27] something Supernatural when he calls you
[10:31] it will not that's why get rid of all
[10:33] the confusion okay forget all the
[10:36] confusion forget about all the things
[10:38] that that you hear you know oh I heard
[10:41] this happens and I heard I could speak
[10:42] in tongues and I heard that I you know I
[10:44] I would do this and and and then I heard
[10:46] this and I heard that forget about all
[10:48] of that you need to know that you're
[10:51] going to have a supernatural experience
[10:53] and you're going to know that God
[10:55] actually called you you're going to have
[10:57] the sign of the Messiah take place right
[11:00] in your own personal life you will not
[11:03] be able to deny it and nobody will be
[11:05] able to take that experience away from
[11:07] you
[11:08] nobody I don't care what anybody says
[11:11] when somebody's been awakened to the
[11:14] revelation of who they are as a son or a
[11:17] daughter of God there is no demon in the
[11:20] pits of hell no nothing Jesus said the
[11:23] Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against
[11:27] it it's a simp f is
[11:30] that so if you haven't had that yet let
[11:35] that be what burns within your heart say
[11:38] Lord let that be what burns within My
[11:41] Heart Lord I want to know now don't
[11:44] think oh you got to walk up and a a bush
[11:47] is going to be on fire in front of
[11:49] you could that happen
[11:52] sure but is that the evidence
[11:56] no what is it
[11:59] what is it that that that that because
[12:02] all of a
[12:04] sudden this word that you've been
[12:07] reading that you've heard about that
[12:10] you've been taught that you've listened
[12:13] to the priest you've listened to the
[12:14] preacher you've listened to your mom
[12:16] you've listened to your dad you've heard
[12:18] it it's all been word it's all been
[12:21] letter it's all been rules it's all been
[12:24] things that I should things that I
[12:26] shouldn't do that all gets blown right
[12:29] out of the water and Jesus comes to you
[12:32] personally and he opens your your your
[12:35] understanding in a way that you can't
[12:38] you can't you can't get away from
[12:41] it you can't get away from it I I
[12:43] remember I remember listen I I remember
[12:46] people were trying to convince me to go
[12:48] to church you know they would tell me
[12:49] you should come to my church you should
[12:51] go to this church that church but when
[12:53] this word was revealed to me I couldn't
[12:58] get enough church I couldn't get enough
[13:01] of the word I couldn't ever I wanted to
[13:03] read constantly read I didn't want to go
[13:05] to work I just wanted to feed on the
[13:08] word listen to The Prophet feed on the
[13:10] word go to
[13:12] church because because it became so real
[13:16] and all I could see was all these
[13:18] experiences in my life all these things
[13:20] that that God was doing around my life
[13:22] and the reason why this and the reason
[13:24] why that and he started to answer this
[13:26] question and he answered that question
[13:28] and because he became real he he started
[13:31] to show himself and his thoughts started
[13:34] to come in you do you know what I'm
[13:36] saying here amen come on you you know
[13:39] that you know you know that God is
[13:41] revealing it to you it's a reality that
[13:43] that that goes beyond being taught or or
[13:46] or just belonging to a church or or this
[13:48] pastor's got
[13:50] it so maybe I got to go to this church
[13:54] oh no maybe I got to go to that
[13:57] church glory to God Amen it's not the
[14:01] church that you go to it's the spirit of
[14:04] Revelation that's come upon you to hear
[14:07] the word and to know where God is
[14:10] placing you where God is using you God
[14:12] is speaking to you in a certain church
[14:15] because he's got a position for you in
[14:17] that church and as long as Israel was in
[14:21] her Homeland God would bless her but the
[14:25] minute you go outside of your land the
[14:27] moment that you start to go looking
[14:29] elsewhere you start to look for
[14:31] interpretation here interpretation there
[14:34] well I should well I don't I don't need
[14:36] to pay tithes I'll just pay my tithes to
[14:38] the voice of God and I'll pay them when
[14:40] I want and I and I I don't want to be
[14:42] account I don't want to be held
[14:43] accountable to nothing you see that
[14:45] shows that you really haven't come into
[14:49] contact with Christ
[14:52] himself you know that you're you're
[14:54] you're naked before God you know that he
[14:56] knows your life you know that you You
[14:58] Can't Hide anymore that everything that
[15:01] you do when you're doing it you're doing
[15:03] it because you are aware that God is
[15:07] aware hallelujah praise God he didn't
[15:11] need to he listen Jesus didn't need to
[15:14] get into the boat but he wanted to get
[15:17] into the boat because you heard him what
[15:19] he said you know Peter was saying listen
[15:21] I got you know I'm busy I got I got
[15:24] things I got to go do I got to go figure
[15:25] out how I'm going to pay this debt I'm
[15:27] going to have to go do another side job
[15:29] I'm going to have to go build something
[15:30] now to to make some extra money and you
[15:32] want me to go
[15:33] deeper no Jesus was looking deeper into
[15:37] him Jesus knew what was deep beneath
[15:40] that skin if Jesus could see that there
[15:43] was fish deep in the water do you think
[15:45] God you think Jesus couldn't see what
[15:47] was deep within him don't you know God
[15:50] can see what's deep within you and why
[15:53] he's calling you why he's placing you
[15:56] God has all of that in the in the back
[15:58] of his mind let's go to the next slide
[16:00] listen to brother brandom he says here
[16:02] now listen notice how his own
[16:04] predestinated sheep followed him right
[16:07] in the days of the greatest theologians
[16:11] that we ever had they come right out
[16:14] because they knew him they knew what the
[16:17] word had promised for that day they know
[16:21] what the Messiah was to be like when he
[16:23] came and Simon Peter came to him which
[16:27] was only Simon then you see there was a
[16:30] Simon and there was a
[16:32] Peter and Andrew had tried to tell him
[16:36] about that you know his brother Simon
[16:38] you got to come and see you gotta listen
[16:40] this this is the Messiah you know
[16:43] because Andrew had a real experience
[16:45] something was revealed to Andrew that he
[16:47] was the Messiah you know that's why you
[16:50] know when you when you when you got on
[16:52] fire man I remember I telling everybody
[16:54] and everything around me that Jesus
[16:57] Christ is a reality
[16:59] he's real he's a living God he's present
[17:01] right now and he's dealing with people
[17:04] he's dealing with me he's dealing with
[17:06] me he's dealing with I see it in my
[17:08] brothers and my sisters that he's a
[17:10] reality but you know Peter and Simon he
[17:13] just Andrew please you know like I got
[17:17] debts I got to pay debts okay but you
[17:20] see this man is the Messiah and when God
[17:24] becomes a reality to you your family
[17:26] your friends
[17:28] they will know that you are
[17:31] different they will know that you don't
[17:34] change your
[17:36] tune they will know that God is a
[17:38] reality to you that's beyond what they
[17:41] know they just can't quite put a finger
[17:44] on it but they
[17:48] know well Simon of course he was maybe a
[17:51] little hot-headed hardheaded and he
[17:53] wouldn't go but when he walked up into
[17:56] the presence of Jesus when Jesus said
[17:59] your name is Simon and you are the son
[18:02] of Jonas now we know that Jesus told his
[18:05] Apostles that he knew them and he before
[18:08] the foundations of the world they were
[18:12] attributes of his
[18:15] thoughts that's where it everything
[18:17] changes you see when Jesus came into
[18:20] your life when this message came into
[18:23] your life it was because the Holy Spirit
[18:26] was coming to an Atri rute not to Daniel
[18:31] gusin not to Tina it was coming to the
[18:36] attributes they have plans they're all
[18:40] excited they're they got great plans
[18:43] guess what Jesus has greater
[18:48] plans Jesus has something in store that
[18:51] that he had from before the foundations
[18:53] of the world and as long as they can
[18:56] fall into Jesus plan Jesus word
[19:00] recognize what the word says about them
[19:04] as a husband as a wife as a provider all
[19:08] those things as a father as a all those
[19:10] things that the word says about them in
[19:13] the word of God they will
[19:15] prosper they will move forward in the
[19:17] name of the Lord and God will do things
[19:19] for them that they will not need to do
[19:22] anything they will just trust and Obey
[19:25] and know that God is in control of their
[19:27] lives
[19:29] amen attributes of God attributes of his
[19:33] thoughts therefore being that seed
[19:35] laying in him and knew that the word
[19:38] said and had been promised that the
[19:41] Messiah would be a prophet and when he
[19:43] seen that he was through with fishing he
[19:47] knew then that he would drop his Nets
[19:50] because he was be he'd be going to
[19:53] become a fisher of men and that's from
[19:57] 19 65 lean not unto your own
[20:03] Understanding God's prophet and so he
[20:07] knew that that that something was deeper
[20:11] Jesus knew that there was something in
[20:12] Peter's life that he was going to come
[20:14] to know and I want you to you know I
[20:16] want you to see something else
[20:19] here Jesus knew also that Peter would
[20:22] deny him three
[20:24] times even after his conversion in the
[20:27] boat
[20:30] you're going to make mistakes you're
[20:32] going to do things that you wish you
[20:34] never did you're going to say things
[20:36] that you wish you never said you're
[20:38] going to you're going to get caught the
[20:39] enemy is going to trap you and and all
[20:41] of a sudden you're going to be in an
[20:43] embarrassing situation Hallelujah and
[20:46] you might even deny the word of
[20:50] God and Jesus knew that about Peter but
[20:54] yet Peter is written in the word of God
[20:58] as one that went to the Gentiles as one
[21:01] that was a mighty minister of God wrote
[21:05] Into the scriptures was used of God in a
[21:08] mighty way Supernatural God made him
[21:11] somebody that he never thought that he
[21:13] would be but God knew everything about
[21:17] Peter God knew everything about Peter he
[21:20] knew his life he knew his future just
[21:22] like he knows yours he knows what you're
[21:24] headed for he knows what you're going to
[21:26] do in the word of God he knows that some
[21:28] are going to leave some are going to
[21:31] leave there's nothing that we can do
[21:33] about that you you heard the parable the
[21:36] parable of Heaven is a is a net and all
[21:39] kinds are going to come into that net
[21:41] but he's going to take out the rainbow
[21:43] trout and the rest he's going to throw
[21:45] away it's just as simple as that because
[21:48] not everybody is attributes of God not
[21:53] everyone that lives in this world is a
[21:55] son or a daughter of God they come
[21:57] through Pro creation they come through
[21:59] the through the Avenue of a man and a
[22:01] woman coming together and bringing forth
[22:04] seed of their own kind and bringing
[22:07] forth individuals and then a life comes
[22:09] into that body not every soul that goes
[22:12] into each and every body has within it
[22:15] the attribute of God there has to be
[22:18] representation from God in there that
[22:21] was the great mystery that was a thing
[22:23] that that that you know that that would
[22:25] would not be interpreted you couldn't
[22:27] put an inter interpretation on that it's
[22:29] always been all the way down Through the
[22:31] Ages God placed a portion of himself in
[22:35] each and every son and daughter of God
[22:38] and he said my sheep my
[22:42] attributes my sheep my sheep hear my
[22:46] voice what what you know like that that
[22:49] has to become a reality to you that
[22:52] you're actually hearing the voice of God
[22:56] it's not just that you're hearing
[22:58] brother branham's voice you're hearing
[23:00] the voice of God through brother
[23:03] brandham and the Revelation that brother
[23:05] brandham has when he's speaking on that
[23:08] word and he's revealing the word and
[23:10] he's preaching the word and and the
[23:12] seals are being open the voice that's
[23:14] coming through brother brandom is the
[23:16] voice of God it's a supernatural element
[23:19] that's speaking to the attribute that's
[23:22] within you and that's calling you and
[23:24] placing you into the body allowing you
[23:26] to say Amen to this word hallelujah
[23:30] allowing you to to to to to be shaped by
[23:33] the word of God and to to be placed
[23:36] positionally right where God wants you
[23:38] to be amen praise God hallelujah so we
[23:42] know that that Parable is a Dragnet and
[23:44] it's it's it's it's typing everything
[23:46] that that's going to happen in the end
[23:48] time there's a lot of people that are
[23:50] being called into churches a lot of
[23:52] people are starting to look at what's
[23:53] going on in Israel and they're and
[23:55] they're looking at it and they're saying
[23:56] man you know what I better get back to
[23:57] church because things are really
[23:59] starting I I heard the the the pastor
[24:01] preaching about something about Israel
[24:03] you know something about war in Israel
[24:05] something about the big battle of
[24:07] Armageddon and that's where that's where
[24:09] that's in the Middle East there's a big
[24:10] Valley there and that's you know all of
[24:12] a sudden people are starting to
[24:14] naturally they're starting to awaken to
[24:17] that you know to what's going on in the
[24:18] world and so there people are maybe
[24:20] starting to go to church they're
[24:22] listening in on on YouTube a little more
[24:25] and listening in on what Jesus said
[24:26] about it and you know they're trying to
[24:28] put one plus one together but let me
[24:30] tell you something this goes beyond
[24:33] putting one and one
[24:35] together this is this is where where you
[24:38] can you all you can do is Jesus said
[24:41] unless my father my spirit you got to
[24:44] understand Jesus was the father is the
[24:48] father is the Holy Ghost Jesus Christ is
[24:52] the human name that he took when he came
[24:54] to Earth but he is Elohim he is the
[24:57] self-existent one one God not three Gods
[25:01] not not not you know the Mighty God the
[25:04] almighty no no one God and unless you
[25:07] get that as your foundation you're going
[25:09] to be listening to a lot of things that
[25:11] are not going to make sense so you need
[25:13] to say so when Jesus was here and he
[25:15] said the all that the father hath given
[25:19] me will
[25:21] come I'm going to I'm going to read that
[25:24] I'm going to speak that a little
[25:25] different right now all that I have
[25:29] given myself from before the foundations
[25:31] of the world the sons and daughters that
[25:34] were with me before where were you job
[25:37] when the Sons and Daughters of God
[25:39] rejoiced together around the throne
[25:42] where were you you see he has sons and
[25:45] daughters only one God there was only
[25:47] one that stepped out from the throne it
[25:49] was Jesus Christ it was God himself it's
[25:53] all one person so all that I have given
[25:57] myself self will come to
[26:00] me I will draw
[26:03] [Applause]
[26:06] them my sheep hear my voice they
[26:12] recognize and so that element when that
[26:15] takes place within a Christian walk
[26:18] Everything Changes the scriptures change
[26:21] all of a sudden now it's not baptism in
[26:24] the name of the father and of the son
[26:26] and of the Holy Spirit all of a sudden
[26:28] now because you got a revelation that
[26:30] it's just one God and when Jesus stood
[26:32] there in his glorified body and he stood
[26:35] before his disciples and said go ye into
[26:39] all the world baptizing them in the
[26:43] name name n a m e not titles he said
[26:49] name he said now I can show you
[26:51] scripture after
[26:53] scripture that there's only one name
[26:56] that man must must be saved by and that
[26:59] name is Jesus Christ and so when he said
[27:02] in the name of the father in other words
[27:05] the name is
[27:07] Jesus because the father is Jesus the
[27:10] son is Jesus the holy spirit is Jesus
[27:14] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[27:17] the New Testament look up Jehovah
[27:20] Jehovah the word means Jehovah Jesus our
[27:23] savior you see it was all talking about
[27:26] the coming of the
[27:29] Lord I want to keep this simple you see
[27:32] without without without a a foundation
[27:35] of knowing who your your relationship is
[27:38] with you can't really have the right
[27:41] relationship you can't really be all
[27:44] that God wants you to be because now
[27:46] you're you're not listening to his voice
[27:49] you're listening to man's interpretation
[27:51] you'll go on and you'll listen to the
[27:52] Baptist preacher and then you'll because
[27:54] you're a little confused you think okay
[27:55] wait a minute let me listen to this this
[27:57] uh denomination and see how they uh you
[28:01] know interpret God now God needs to be
[28:04] interpreted to you personally by he
[28:07] himself period it's as simple as that
[28:10] until you can get that clear you know I
[28:12] try to tell people that I try to say to
[28:14] people listen you know like I understand
[28:17] you know that you know you're seeing
[28:19] what you're seeing but I'm just saying
[28:21] that you know I had an experience by the
[28:24] Holy Ghost and God gave me his spirit
[28:27] Jesus said I will send you the
[28:29] comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he
[28:32] will guide you into all truth I'm
[28:35] trusting in that guide that it's taking
[28:38] me to all truth I can't I can't see it
[28:41] any other way everywhere I look in the
[28:43] scripture I see Jesus Christ I see him
[28:46] in the Old Testament I see him in the
[28:47] New Testament I see him in every single
[28:50] scripture because he is the scripture he
[28:53] is the word so if you don't see him in
[28:57] every word brother Braham says go back
[29:00] and check and pray and see where you
[29:03] where you missed him because you missed
[29:05] him somewhere when somebody comes to you
[29:07] and says well wait a minute the the
[29:09] Bible's you know Jesus said go and
[29:11] baptize in the name of the father Son
[29:13] and Holy Ghost then Peter over here goes
[29:15] and baptizes in the name of Jesus Christ
[29:17] that's a
[29:20] contradiction I just finished explaining
[29:22] it that's no contradiction Peter Simon
[29:26] who became Peter
[29:28] who got revelated was standing right
[29:30] there when Jesus came and said go ye
[29:33] into all the world Peter was right there
[29:35] yes Lord baptizing them in the name of
[29:38] the father and of the son and of the
[29:40] Holy Spirit and Peter said yes Lord and
[29:44] on the day of Pentecost you go and read
[29:46] it I tell I tell preachers you know
[29:48] theologians they said listen here's
[29:51] Jesus given his commission he Peter you
[29:54] do you acknowledge Peter was there yes
[29:56] he was yes he was okay good because on
[29:58] the day of Pentecost can you please read
[30:00] to me what the subscription was when
[30:03] Peter stood in front of all the people
[30:05] when they asked them what do we do to be
[30:07] saved right do you hear Peter saying I
[30:11] go ye and repent every one of you and be
[30:14] baptized in the name of the father and
[30:16] of the son and of the he says no that's
[30:18] not what it says I said what does it
[30:21] say
[30:24] sir he says in the name of the Lord
[30:31] Jesus I said what did you say you see
[30:36] some
[30:37] people
[30:39] regardless they will still turn around
[30:41] and
[30:43] say that means that I'd have to change
[30:47] everything that means that my whole life
[30:50] as a fisherman would be over because he
[30:53] just asked me to follow him indirectly
[30:57] the word just
[30:59] said follow me and that person is saying
[31:03] wait a minute here my family will disown
[31:09] me my friends will absolutely disown me
[31:14] my friends are going to think I've lost
[31:16] my mind because I'm putting the word of
[31:19] God first and I'm as an adult I received
[31:23] that Revelation and I went straight to
[31:26] the tank because I knew it was the truth
[31:29] and I knew that my old life had to die
[31:33] it had to be left in the deep it had to
[31:37] be left
[31:38] behind and when that Revelation strikes
[31:41] an individual and it comes into their
[31:43] heart there's nothing that'll stop them
[31:46] from going to the water and and that old
[31:49] life being buried and sunk and left
[31:52] behind because they realize it's the
[31:54] truth the TR Jesus said the truth shall
[31:58] set you free not a
[32:02] lie so if you remain in the LIE then
[32:06] who's
[32:07] responsible you see God is going to he's
[32:09] going to give witness to every single
[32:12] person on this Earth that he's a living
[32:14] God and you can drive down the roads and
[32:17] you'll look and just glance over and it
[32:19] says Jesus who so loved the world that
[32:22] he gave
[32:24] himself Jesus loves you
[32:28] Jesus is the way the truth and the life
[32:31] he's going to leave a testimony some
[32:34] people just won't stay long enough to
[32:37] listen they won't they won't just relax
[32:41] and allow you to say what it is that you
[32:43] need to say about the word of God and
[32:47] and and and and and challenge them to
[32:49] actually search the scriptures for in
[32:51] them you think you have eternal
[32:54] life but it's a reality Saint
[32:58] Jesus made it very clear when he
[33:03] made his elaboration on the Kingdom of
[33:06] Heaven and the
[33:08] net so we know that Jesus knew knew that
[33:13] Peter was going to deny him three times
[33:16] but did that stop Jesus from coming into
[33:18] his life no absolutely not because Jesus
[33:23] knows your life sees the end from the
[33:26] beginning
[33:28] then that Miracle took place and Peter
[33:31] could not deny what he was seeing with
[33:34] his own eyes the two boats were filled
[33:37] with
[33:38] fish he saw it he he couldn't deny it he
[33:43] couldn't deny that that this man just
[33:45] called him by his name and told him who
[33:48] his father's name was he couldn't deny
[33:50] it but
[33:52] yet down the road he was going to deny
[33:54] Jesus Christ because the human side of
[33:57] Simon would still struggle with the
[34:00] world just like you and me we're still
[34:03] in this
[34:04] world we're still just as human as
[34:07] anybody else we're no better than
[34:08] anybody else I brag on Jesus Christ I
[34:12] don't brag about
[34:13] myself I brag on Christ I brag that I
[34:17] brag on him to say Jehovah Gyra provides
[34:20] all my needs I brag on him I do what I
[34:23] need to do I brag on Christ to know that
[34:27] he's the one that that that makes things
[34:29] happen I cannot take credit the only
[34:32] thing that I can do that God said to me
[34:34] says listen you need to overcome and I'm
[34:38] telling you saints of God you need to
[34:40] overcome this you need to overcome your
[34:43] your your your weaknesses you know those
[34:45] those things of your of your past the
[34:48] things the scars that you know that
[34:50] you're holding on to maybe some bad
[34:52] experiences you need to you need to
[34:54] replace those with the word of God
[34:56] replace those those you know those
[34:58] moments when those times come up and
[35:00] Satan comes to remind you of all your
[35:02] error and all your mistakes and all your
[35:05] past and everything else if you've truly
[35:08] come into a relationship with God the
[35:10] first thing you did when that happened
[35:12] was you got on your knees like Peter
[35:15] you've seen what he did he humbled
[35:17] himself he got down on his knees and he
[35:20] said Lord depart from me I don't deserve
[35:24] this I remember when the word came in
[35:26] into my life and and I realized the kind
[35:28] of life I was living and I seen what he
[35:30] was doing and I I said I don't deserve
[35:32] this there's no way I deserve this kind
[35:35] of Grace and this love that I'm
[35:37] experiencing and I'm feeling I I don't
[35:39] understand it it's beyond human
[35:41] comprehension that God would intervene
[35:43] in my life in such a way I did not
[35:46] deserve it all like I would drive down
[35:48] the road and I'd just be going oh thank
[35:50] you thank you thank you Lord thank you
[35:53] Lord it would just be constant because I
[35:56] couldn't believe that the word made
[35:57] himself real to
[35:59] me and everything becomes a reality to
[36:02] you then in the word of God and you
[36:04] can't help it and Peter he he listen he
[36:08] was he was you know he could have listen
[36:10] he could have had a lot of Pride like a
[36:11] lot of people and said well you know
[36:14] what the fish weren't biting last
[36:17] night way to go guys we got a nice
[36:20] catch who is this
[36:23] guy you know Pride will do that God will
[36:27] do something in
[36:29] front of an
[36:31] unbeliever
[36:33] right and put that unbeliever right
[36:36] there and he will
[36:38] deny the miracle right to your
[36:43] face God's not interested in their
[36:46] reaction he's looking at
[36:49] yours he's looking to see what is in you
[36:54] he wants to know if that reality is
[36:57] there if you're you know Peter got on
[37:00] his knees you know what that means
[37:01] you're you humble yourself before God
[37:05] you humble before God because you didn't
[37:07] do anything to deserve this there's
[37:12] nothing you could ever do to deserve
[37:14] God's salvation Peter could have been
[37:17] full of Pride and I can do this and I
[37:20] can do that and well you know what you
[37:22] know we just had a bad night fishing
[37:24] boys you know we always catch fish you
[37:26] know but no God knew his need God knew
[37:30] and when he when God did it right there
[37:32] he knew that he says Thou Art the Lamb
[37:35] of God he knew that he was God he knew
[37:38] the reality and he humbled himself and
[37:41] he stood there and he let God now do for
[37:44] him what God was going to do what Jesus
[37:47] saw what God what Jesus knew he was
[37:49] going to do in his life that was the
[37:51] right response coming from
[37:54] Peter amen praise God and when you you
[37:57] know there's listen there's Simon and
[37:59] then there's
[38:00] Peter there's you that I see here on
[38:03] Sunday and I know you guys here on
[38:05] Sunday I see you I see your your
[38:08] character I see the way you greet me the
[38:10] way you don't greet me the way you do
[38:12] this the way you do that I see all of
[38:14] those things but do I see you on Monday
[38:17] Tuesday the other person
[38:19] Simon you know I I I I don't really know
[38:23] that person Pastor Simon doesn't really
[38:25] know that person unless God reveals to
[38:27] them exactly what and who you really
[38:31] are you can be you can be a hypocrite
[38:35] and come into the house of the Lord but
[38:38] if there's an attribute of God in there
[38:40] it's going to edify the body amen when I
[38:43] see you I feel edified I feel encouraged
[38:47] I feel blessed because you are one of
[38:50] those joints we're going to be looking
[38:51] at things I haven't even
[38:54] started I'm not kidding you I I got I
[38:57] got I got a whole series of messages
[38:59] that I've been putting together and God
[39:02] every week when I start when I think
[39:03] okay I'm going to do this this that all
[39:05] of a sudden he he comes here he says no
[39:07] we got some work to do I said oh okay I
[39:10] said Lord I know I need work I need help
[39:13] too Lord he says we gota we gota we got
[39:16] to really lay that foundation in good so
[39:18] that so that those that are that are
[39:20] going to fish the real fishermen they're
[39:23] going to have a revelation on fishing
[39:25] they're going to understand what it is
[39:27] to fish they're not going to be somebody
[39:28] that just goes out and you listen to
[39:30] this Tech you listen to this track you
[39:32] read this track and listen to this tape
[39:34] and if you can hear and you can
[39:36] recognize then you're an attribute of
[39:37] God if not you're a
[39:40] devil that's not the way it
[39:43] works it's not
[39:46] that the word has to be revealed
[39:50] personal so you the best thing that you
[39:53] can do in every situation
[39:56] is Express God's love to the people show
[40:02] them that you have the character of
[40:06] Christ Christ came he came to to call
[40:10] his own he says you know I didn't come
[40:13] for for those that that were righteous
[40:15] that didn't need me a lot of people say
[40:18] I got church Danny I got you know you
[40:20] know I sit down with people sometimes
[40:22] and they'll say oh I don't want to go
[40:23] there I said no no no no problem
[40:29] I don't want to go there
[40:31] either praise God because because Jesus
[40:36] is where every answer every uh uh
[40:41] problem can be
[40:42] solved but you got to be able to get
[40:44] somebody to sit still enough to listen
[40:47] amen praise God let's read we're going
[40:49] to wind this down right now let's read
[40:51] the next um uh scripture or next quote
[40:54] here from Brother Bram he says
[40:57] notice now we're talking about Simon and
[41:00] Peter we're talking about you know you
[41:02] in church and you at work and you know
[41:04] God God knows all about us you know he
[41:06] knows he knows the Simon in you and he
[41:08] knows the Peter in you amen and when you
[41:10] come into the house of the Lord he's you
[41:12] know he's speaking he's speaking to the
[41:14] to the attribute but he's he's dealing
[41:17] with the human element the weakness the
[41:22] the the the the stubborn Spirit the you
[41:24] know all those things that that we
[41:26] struggle with in this human realm amen
[41:29] notice there was a man an old fisherman
[41:31] who came to him by the name of Simon
[41:33] Peter his name then was Simon you see
[41:37] look like this just keeps coming out of
[41:39] the word his name then was Simon and
[41:41] when he came the strange thing about it
[41:44] Jesus yesterday now we're talking about
[41:47] he's the same yesterday today and
[41:48] forever amen he knew who he was he knew
[41:53] exactly everything that he needed to
[41:55] know about Peter
[41:56] he knew he was and he told him what his
[42:00] name was St John the first chapter said
[42:03] Thou Art Simon and your father's name is
[42:06] Jonas he could discern his life I
[42:09] remember when Jesus discerned my life I
[42:12] will never forget it I'm not going to
[42:14] get into it but when it happened and he
[42:18] spoke my
[42:19] name every demon that was around my life
[42:23] went into total abs absolute
[42:28] chaos they had no idea that it was going
[42:31] to happen I had no idea it was going to
[42:34] happen but when it
[42:36] happened everything started to shake
[42:39] around my life and everything shook
[42:41] around your life when this word came
[42:44] when Jesus made himself real to you he
[42:46] says what do you think that old
[42:48] fisherman with that greasy apron on
[42:50] thought when Jesus a man that had never
[42:53] seen him told him what his name was and
[42:56] what his daddy's name was that was kind
[42:59] of strange said now I'm going to give
[43:01] you another
[43:04] name that's what we've been hearing
[43:07] every time we come into the house of the
[43:09] Lord we're hearing him call our name you
[43:12] see the opening of that seventh seal was
[43:15] to reveal each and every son and
[43:18] daughter of God that was going to be
[43:21] called by their Supernatural name in
[43:25] this day
[43:27] that was something that he was going to
[43:29] do
[43:30] himself now you can say well I heard my
[43:33] name because I recognize the message of
[43:35] the hour that's good but that ain't
[43:39] enough oh but I I know that brother
[43:41] brandham is the prophet of the 20th
[43:43] century and that he was Malachi 4 and
[43:46] Revelations 10:7 he fulfilled that
[43:48] scripture that's good but that ain't
[43:52] enough Oh you mean there's more yeah I
[43:56] said Jesus Christ brother Bram says I
[43:59] got to decrease so that he can
[44:01] increase I got to do something that that
[44:04] that that you can't do brother brandom
[44:07] I'm gonna have to do it myself I'm going
[44:09] to need to come down myself and take
[44:12] care of this because their names are
[44:14] written on my
[44:16] Palms oh yes they're every single one of
[44:19] them they're written there and not one
[44:21] of them is going to be lost and I'm
[44:23] going to call them in such a way that
[44:25] they're going to know know that I know
[44:27] that they
[44:28] know Hallelujah glory to God Amen praise
[44:32] God that was Jesus he see now I'm going
[44:35] to give you another name I'm going to
[44:37] call you Peter which is by
[44:39] interpretation a little stone or a
[44:42] little Revelation or I'm going to call
[44:45] you by Revelation it's not Peter the
[44:49] pope it's not Peter the pope that
[44:51] started the church it's Jesus the rock
[44:55] that we stand on which is the revelation
[44:57] of God's word that that's been revealed
[45:00] to you as a son or daughter of God to
[45:03] know Jesus Christ in the power of his
[45:06] resurrection that he's made himself
[45:08] known to you that that that you have
[45:11] within you a stone of Revelation it
[45:15] comes off the great Anvil and and it
[45:17] reflects the spirit of God that light
[45:20] that keeps feeding you when you get
[45:22] caught into Heavenly places in Christ
[45:24] Jesus every Sunday every Wednesday when
[45:27] you feed on the word you're you're
