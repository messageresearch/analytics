TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] some people would say all people Christians they're always talking about deeper you know what happened that someone is all about States it's about recognizing what God is doing we got us planned for sons and daughters and time that are here in this earth I mentioned you know I mean you go to the movies these days you see these movies coming up they're always like you know interdimensional now they're showing all kinds of you know they've taken it to the ridiculous levels you know in horror movies and everything else and they you know they're breaking into all these interdimensional things not realizing that that's you know that there is a reality to that and you know there's there's the worlds of dimensions where there is evil there's no question about it right it actually falls right in this dimension here right here we've got all good right but it's understanding that there's a plan that God had from before the foundations of the world that he planned to redeem sons and daughters children of God and that this is not everything this is not all that we see this is only the drop actually in the whole plan of God praise God bullets Wednesday night and Wednesday night is Bible study gives us an opportunity to look into the areas of the word when we can study in to meditate on it we can fellowship around it you know God loves for us to come and fellowship with him that's what this is churches about fellowship it's about meeting with God amen it started way back in the Dartmouth II wouldn't happen II would have fellowship in the cool of the evening they would get together with the Lord and they would have divine fellowship amen praise God and that's what we're being restored back to so we just want to continue along the lines that we've been ministering on the rapture we Bible I believe that there's a there's a revival that's taking place right now mister and there's there was revivals in every season you know God would stir up an individual will bring forth revelation and that individual would like it'll have an effect on other people because that's God's Way right faith cometh by hearing so he uses the preaching of the word of God to bring forth faith and you know it's always revival his work and God would come and he would use an individual to break a certain pattern or complacency here you know they would take the word and they would try to organize the wording and say well God is with us and God is only with us and you have to do it the way that we say it and then it would put his interpretation of the Word of God and then God would just say foolish and gets his own ideas that starts thinking his own ways and so God has to move on and he stirs another reminder amen and so here we are in the last case we're in the time of the season of the rapture of the church we're going to leave this place but before we do that we're going to need a certain kind of faith in order to translate these bodies amen and so there's a revival now and the land I plead with all my heart that God wants to get his children in place positionally so that they can see their place in the word and when you see your heart in the Word of God that's going to give you such faith to operate in it and then God's gonna love that word because that's what he does he and that's how you know he brings his word about that's how he brings his word vygotsky's his old interpreter does not need men to interpret his work God uses men to interpret his work he God gets inside of that God that transforms man he transforms their lives their ways their thinking their traditions he gets them out of there out of the world traditions and teachings and and he he shows himself he indicates his own word he brings his word to us even hey so we're in the rapture of the Bible because God's going to take the church we're gonna read from the book of Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 to 16 I'm gonna read it from the amplified version praise God let's pray father we just want to thank you for this opportunity to learn more because we know that it's an opportunity to meet with you in heavenly places Lord where our position is waiting and Lord when we get into that place magic begins to happen in the Bride of Christ the body of Christ miracles start to take place nor the sparks start to move from the park to the park Lords it's just your way of fellowshipping it and a meeting with your children or especially an entire like this order of the world is so caught up in so many different teachings and New Age movements and interpretations of God and the universe and how things are supposed to be in here we are born we can assemble Lourdes as simple people but your presence would come and just take control of this word and anoint it so that we can speak it and so that we can understand it granted tonight father Lord remember our pastor as he prepares for a trip to New Mexico where he will go administer the Word of God over these next four or five days and Lord just anointed especially Lord let your your purpose in your plan be established through this trip and let the people receive what they need to receive and or just use them in a supernatural way to be commitment to your heads place your angels around them in captain with your presence of God inspire the supernatural in Jesus name our pastor over these next four days could be leaving tomorrow for New Mexico he's a big ministry with the scenes down there praise God Ephesians chapter 4 verse 11 and his gifts were varied himself appointed and gave men to us some to be apostles special messengers [Music] some prophets inspired preachers and expounder some evangelists preachers of the gospel traveling missionaries some pastors shepherds of his flock and teachers his intention was the perfecting and the full equipping of the six has come and they should do the work of ministry towards building up Christ's body the church that it might develop until we all attain oneness in the faith and in the comprehension of the folk and accurate knowledge of the Son of God that we may arrive at really mature manhood the completeness of personality which is nothing less than the standard height of Christ's own perfection the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and the completeness found in him this is going to take us into her subject in verse 14 so that we may no longer be children tossed like ships to and fro between chats gusts of teaching and wavering with every changing wind of doctrine the prey of the cunning and cleverness of a scrupulous man gamblers engaged in every shifting form of Turkey in inventing errors to mislead rather let our lives lovingly Express truth in all things speaking truly dealing truly living truly and folded in luck let us grow up in every way and in all things up to him who is the head even Christ the Messiah The Anointed One for because of mechanical all on the church in all its various parts closely joined and firmly meant together by the joints and ligaments with which it is supplied when each part with power adapted to its need is working properly in all its functions rules to full maturity building itself up in love praise God the Lord that is bestest the work may be seated our topic tonight what we're going to be looking at is building the body of the love you know this body that you know all we need to do is to go back into the mind of God you know to recognize and to realize that there was a desire being God to express himself so that he could have published now the reason why you know like we can't explain God we can't say this is why know we can only fellowship around the Word of God and come together in in ministry and then it allows him to come in and minister and show us and express his thoughts and my revelation give us some understanding of what it is that he was and why he's doing it believe that because you know if your son or daughter of God you have to have experienced the love of God you know the first thing that I can recall but God intervened you know was that he allowed me to to experience his love and it surpassed every emotional desire or experience or hi because you know I was like you know I was I was in a drug situation where you know when you're doing drugs is because you're trying to an expiry you're trying to experience a euphoria you try to you know get out of whether it's drugs drinking whatever it is you're trying to get out of a certain mental condition to enter into some sort of it at the euphoria that allows you to just experience something beyond anything you know and so you know when God gives you an experience of his love it pulls everything else out of the water that could even come close because you hear on this earth that you're trying to you know you're trying to achieve something you're trying to like find out this ultimate happiness this ultimate you know purpose of being on this earth and and then when God touched you you know all I can remember is that it just didn't compare with anything so it must be that God wanted to express this and a fellowship you know like that euphoria that I could just imagine what Adam and Eve must have experienced when God would come down and fellowship with them we just get a little dew drop every now then you know you get cottages presents whether you're in prayer whether you're in worship and you know you'reyou're you're in the you're in the service and the word is just coming in such a way that you're like you're just feeling this ain't that amazing euphoria of being totally set free that there's nothing to hold you reality and so God was expressing this desire and he wanted to express it so the only way that he could you know express it and have it like expressed back to him was to have a family you know there's nothing that listen you you know as it as individuals right you know like a child when it's a child it only knows the love of the parent it cannot express and Kent it you know quite you know say oh I love her so much on your nose when you look at that child that child looks into the mother's eyes that feeds it and loves it and takes care of that child is focused you're trying to take that child away from that mother and that child was screaming for dear life because it has experienced something that explain it just like we can't really explain it but we know that without God's love in our lives we would not be able to even be here tonight as a church you know like a true church because listen if you're talking to church to just come and you know join and be seen and sing that you belong to a church because we heard there's going to be you know tribulation on the earth and so you want to try to escape that you're really go then 98% of the churches that are out there but if you have experienced God in the power of his resurrection you have experienced his love that goes beyond human you can't explain it there's there's no way you can explain it it's just because you just live with it's in your right hand you cannot live without it without God's presence in my life even a minute how can you if you're a son a daughter of God it's because he's in you yes and you know like what ends up happening you know over time you know like here I am I'm 20 25th year of my awareness as a son of doctor I was always a Seneca you were all these sons and daughters of company but you come into an awareness at some point your life and you realize that it wasn't some you know experience you know because I went to a lot of seminars legal seminar so exciting and so popular health and everything else and then the following week I'd be down at the dosa get people because it was temporary this is not temporary what we have experienced is not temporary God has has has placed in us a portion of himself feed and the deep called to the deep there's a constant fellowship in the body of Christ and so tonight we're looking at the how the body is being built in love because we just read here where it said right in the last you know couple of lines here he said when each part when power adapted to its need is working properly in all its functions grows to full maturity building itself up in love so we're being built up in love with the King James Version and sensing that tongue that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the past of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love so there's there's something that there's a power in the Word of God when it comes to sons and daughters of God getting into their positions and they have entered into the revelation of God's love God's purpose God's desire you see you can't operate in your position as a son or daughter of God and be doing it by intellectual understanding you know we looked at all the different gifts that are within the body and all those gifts are in you but but you need to recognize that the gift that's been placed in there operates by the Holy Ghost it operates by the Spirit of God and the Spirit of God operates by divine love there's a divine love that operates that gift that activates it when we come to understand how God desires to eat in the church so I'm going to be the food here because you know this whole kind of caught my attention to us like when I was reading it and it'll just kind of you know come together here as we as we study because it's a Bible study right and so you know now he said he made known to us the mystery this is brother brother speaking here this isn't a book of adoption book number four he says now he said he made known to us the mystery he says get the Holy Spirit on you sometime and start running that and just watch how it goes that he's talking about you know where you get into a Bible study or into prayer or into feet word of god right because that's this is what this is we need to realize we're just not here tonight to just join together and Shore selves and you know show up I was there you must have a purpose in being here tonight I hope that you will leave here tonight with something that's going to strengthen you and give you power out there in victory and to have a victorious life amen because your sons and daughters of God we should not live under privilege not lets us to separate ourselves so that he can speak to us and give us what we have be the payment and so here he says you start running that he says just get the Holy Spirit on you sadly the only spirits here thready and he's all over us if he wants to express something else and he says now he says this afternoon I have a little 30 minutes to study just to look over the lesson maybe novices I'll say that half of that maybe 15 minutes between the times and I got to running and I thought the mystery how mysterious and the scripture packed me back into the Old Testament and then back over into the New Testament times something together see the mystery of his coming the mystery of his will the mystery of us sitting together remember it cannot be taught in any seminary it's a mystery this whole plan of God remember this is not something that that can be talked to you this is something you must experience personally by revelation yourself and he says the most of this will the mystery of prostrating together remember it cannot be taught in a seminary it's a mystery you cannot know it by education by theology it's a mystery that's been hidden since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons and so remember he started by saying that God had this plan in the back of his mind that he was going to have fellowship in order to do that he would need to manifest sons and daughters ago because in God was male it be them so all he did was he separated and they wanted to be an earthly expression of himself when he made he created the bottom Adam and took from that body and created Eve but remember they too were what they were one and they were having perfect fellowship in the dark to be it for the perfect target out of I imagine when Adam looked at Eve for the first time he didn't feel he understood but then it was expressed and he saw this beautifully in love with this woman and there was like this this supernatural divine love that they experienced and they would come well that just capped it off it was it was just amazing but God was gonna use out of a need to breathe forth sons and daughters of God because he had given them the big get over the earth and he said no bullet multiply when he said that he had a thought in his mind it was this expression of you know how you fellowship and having more children and that they would be able to come forth just the way that God said let us make man in our image this was all expression so there was a there was a planet there there was a planet of manifestations of the sons and daughters of God God wanted to manifest sons and daughters well this is where we're at now so this is brother Brandi says he says he goes on he says tell me my brother tell me my sister what was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested out silent this time now he says when were there wasn't were there ever a time in history that was to manifest the time to deliver all nature nature the nature itself is brutal waiting for the time of the manifestation or in that time women this all has to call me at some point were the sons and daughters of God fully manifest on the earth and what we do will build interaction and there was gonna be coming back after three and a half years to rule and reign on this earth we need to get to the rapture first indeed we need to get out of here for our first and so at that point we need to see where we're at so that we can recognize the season that were living in and nobody is that is expected of us as sons of God and so here brother Graham continues to say why he says why before the involvement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured up before all the old testament or down there there couldn't have been manifestations it had to wait until mr. diamond it had to come to this age where he would make build his planet position sons and daughters and let the little that you're coming down into full maturity you're coming into the maturity that you need to come in to in order for you to be translated out of this adventure because that dimensional change is only going to be a revelation that's all that that's going to be it's not like hair like you know you're gonna put on this armor and you know we are putting on our but it's the Word of God it's not something visible it's good to be a revelation and the revelation just continues to progress and so listen Harry says it happened to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestations of sons of God coming back and the Spirit of God to these men so perfectly until their ministry would be so close like Christ's to the will join him and this church again now all things has been brought howdy shape it up to a headstone to the manifestations of sons of God coming back and the Spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ will join him and his church together is that not what God is doing in this out that he's drawing us together giving us to operate in our positions BC God set up a perfect dark in the beginning he put in a perfect atmosphere so that he could have a perfect fellowship yes the one thing that he said was do not eat of that tree of knowledge of good and evil that was the only thing that he placed there because it's all part of the plan you see but he had the places here on free moral agency and you're still on three mornings every one of us we are not robots we are not clothes you're not you know being you know shaped like you every world is exactly the same dress it's exactly the same way it's to an exact you know form of everything else no you are daughters of God and by revelation you serve God by revelation you dress right by revelation you live right by revelation you turn up your children but a revelation it's that's what pleases God and that's what God is looking for he's giving us free world agency to choose between light and darkness he's given us that free porn agency to be sons and daughters of God free liberated three sons and daughters of God not under any kind of law by new personality or spirit or anything like that who just wants you to be who you are that's all we want to be but you see when the Pope took place there was a separation that took place let me be deployed here brother Brent says now fellowship sorry he says now when God made man in the beginning to fellowship with him then this man was in perfect fellowship in the dark he was a perfect fellowship with God and how it must have been on that day when God would come down in the full of the team caught he and Eve would come up God didn't go down as it had a need he would go down there he would he would just happen and I haven't even would just immediately recognize his voice feel his presence love that was fear and would just enjoy and they would worship them they would fellowship and commune with the other maybe that's the very thing that calls us together like this setting together in heavenly places and I think you know both should be in the holy spirit no difference in us we are all one in Christ Jesus in that perfect harmony of fellowship there's nothing like it I've ever found on earth is to come together in heavenly places and have communion fellowship with God and with each other now that's what God intended in the dark meaning then that fellowship from God and man was broken I said by unbelief God made a basis and a ground upon which men could remain or retain his notion and it wasn't through a get-together or organizations or education it was on the basis of the shed blood in other words the Holy Ghost that's what gives us propulsion and that's the only place of fellowship that we have with God and the only meeting places through the blood Jesus Christ that's exactly right see and so that's why when we talk about recognizing your day in its message we're talking about Holy Ghost that experience and that oneness that comes with Christ in you your real true relationship but you see that break about shift takes place when singing deceives us when singing temporarily deceives us because you can never permanently deceive a son or daughter god I just can't happen and you can temporarily be in a condition in contemporary allow yourself to separate from the fellowship of the body of Christ and how does that happen when you get to worldly when you get away from church you know you want assemble like you used to you think it's okay to just come on capitis on Sunday or three times a year or whatever I'm exaggerating a little bit but that's that's I think that's what happens when there isn't a real experience well there's a real experience you can't wait to get into his process that's what we do they're not to assemble yourselves even more so as they approach one day these people this the day of the rapture the season of the rapture because that's what you're receiving when you have eaten this looks like a simple Bible study here tonight you know 50 40 50 people join together but there's a lot more happening in this room in sons and daughters who don't recognize that that this is a supernatural meaning this is coming together in heavenly places why don't you see what ends up happening sometimes is we spend too much time in the things of this life you get distracted so much that we start to follow away and lose that that that divine love experience with God that first love you know it'll go back to your first love we've heard that set for and over again but it's the truth and how you do that you get into the word amen you fellowship around the word you assemble yourselves whatever it is there's a service you have a prayer life you have your own personal prayer life you know it's not like you know like where you vote for hours it will closet and you pray and this and that I don't know about you but I'm free and all people I find myself pray tell should be with the Lord all day long say Lord you know this situation here thank you for taking care of that and praise God I forgot all about that lord thank you for bringing that's furthest posted with a man that's what prayer is so soul so yeah there's times where we don't we have prayer meetings there's times when you you do sit with your with your family and prayer with your wife you know that's powerful you need to have that too that's all good but there's a relationship that must be constant and if you're a son of body you've experienced that love you want that constant potion but Satan distracts us he steals our time other you know Adam had a perfect environment that a perfect fellowship with God and singing hated that and found a way to break that the bottom function and city will fight you he paints it when you get into fellowship he hates it when you start to you know recognize who you are that you've been given a position in the body of Christ and then you know if you start to take your position in the church in the body you start to move into your office those people that are moving into certain positions it's just happening it's just naturally taking place and it's wonderful to see that because it's actually them recognizing that they have a part in the bottom and that by activating that part in the body and doing it nothing they have to do it now because they want to be seen not because of you know they're trying to get points with the Baxter or the you know the difference when somebody is in their position and they're doing it because they want to see them the body and the church in the ministry move forward and progress want to see the body strengthen them again and it encouraged it's important for these things to take place but safe what he does is he you know take certain individuals you let knowing them have certain attitudes and to try you know surely like oh you know I need to do that I don't have to do that listen I don't know what you have to do or what you don't have to do even but if you come to that fellowship the God and you get to a place where you pray and you see God and you know this love fill you so much you get into your position you just gravitate to your position because of the normal volume and anointing will be on you you will feel the joy of another sister because please please that you were operating in he's pleased to see that do not do it any other reason but because you've entered into a love affair it's a real experience this is what he wants us the Hospice's because we just read it here in the book of Ephesians an increase of the body unto the edifying of itself because you're in love you're in love with the body of Christ you are purpose listen when we get out of here and we because I hope you may have experienced it you have not experienced it yet but let me tell you what did you do experience that presence of God so much on you you will look at your brothers and sisters and and you will see them like brother brother said nothing but perfect love I cannot explain this you have to experience it brother brother led to the other side and he came back and said nothing a perfect love can enter into that place he experienced that and he said brother sister nothing but perfect love is really get in there he not he came back and he expressed that because he experienced it or did he really did he know only now who had come into this now at the other time were the sons and daughters of Doc would have been effects where we were going to actually experience this Val conduct and another level in a level where it would actually be the process by which we get in the process by which we actually start to with jour in our offices and in our positions in a greater way you know we talk about it we talk about it but do we experience it and this is the thing that you know that that this is the thought this is what came out of the Scriptures while I was studying that I was looking at because there's so much to positioning in the body there's so much that we need to get it brother Bret said that Lyndon you know that sometime one day he says there's going to be such an important thing that's gonna sweep over this product I love the money team that's going to sweep her right out of this image I know that's what it's going to be if you've experienced just a taste of that that you just had you know for sure they can do it and it will do it because that's God's provided way you know I can't fully explain things by revelation but I can't put words to them but all I can tell you is that I know that there's going to be a supernatural love experience that's going to come upon this body and we're going to enter into it God's given us a foretaste doesn't give us a preamble to it saying get ready something is coming there's going to be a sweet that's good that's good place son of God that is going to be something that's gonna take ahold of your life it's going to change your priorities we're not karate but this is God's plan this is the Church of God this is about God having fellowship with his children but city hates it he hates it and he wants to break that fellowship he wants to bring that fellowship that you have seek would watch Anthony go to church everybody to the pool of the evening and he was just sitting there thinking how can I break this motion and don't you think we love it that that same enemy is not looking to hear might be in your situation is in looking for ways to break that but that's why we pray that's why we see the word strengthened I just got more energy to overcome times you know you have such a wonderful service on Sunday you wonder what run that you get blasted from every side and you're wondering why goodness lord help me at this time what is it because you were so blessed and because we were so enlightened and Satan he's trying to prove to God that he can take you down
