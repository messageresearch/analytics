[36:58] provided way amen God has a provided way
[37:01] and if we can recognize that you enter
[37:03] into a place where all things become
[37:08] possible you don't have to remain in the
[37:10] in the mental oppressed condition that
[37:13] you find yourself in constantly the
[37:16] enemy attacking you mentally and anxiety
[37:20] and all kinds of things trying to bring

[37:24] your joy he's your strength he can
[37:26] overcome all of those things let his
[37:28] word do that for you this morning amen
[37:31] let's read our scripture Proverbs 23:26
[37:34] says my son give me thine heart and let
[37:39] Thine Eyes observe my ways amen God
[37:43] bless you may be
[37:45] seated wherever your heart is that's
[37:47] where your treasure is going to be you
[37:50] know that right it's wherever you have
[37:53] you know given your heart and I I
[37:55] remember when I came to the Lord
[37:57] you know I'd heard about God I'd heard
[38:00] about Jesus Christ I'd heard about you
[38:03] know going to church and I'd gone to
[38:05] church I was even an altar boy you know
[38:07] when I was a young kid and I would go to
[38:09] church and I would always think you know
[38:12] oh um this is you know this is uh uh a
[38:16] sacred place you know like as a kid you
[38:19] didn't you didn't fully understand but
[38:21] you know until one day the Lord came and
[38:26] he took my heart amen he took it and
[38:29] when he took it I was in a position in
[38:32] my life where I realized that I had to
[38:35] give it amen and until you come to a
[38:38] place where you realize that you know
[38:41] you you can go on in the condition that
[38:43] you're in you can go on and and deal
[38:47] with everything in your life and have to
[38:49] deal with it on your own because or
[38:52] you're going to go to psychologist or
[38:54] you're going to go to you know you're
[38:55] going to constantly be looking for for
[38:57] somebody to give you the right advice on
[39:00] you know overcoming situations or things
[39:03] or maybe you end up in a in a rehab
[39:06] center because of a drug abuse or you
[39:08] know whatever but until you come to a
[39:12] place where where you can recognize that
[39:14] he's real and he can take your heart he
[39:17] can shape your heart he can restore your
[39:20] heart he can give you joy unspeakable
[39:22] and full of Glory until you come to that
[39:25] place you're gonna have to fight this
[39:28] nature amen praise God and so let's read
[39:32] our next scripture from Romans chapter
[39:35] 9 uh verse
[39:37] 6-13 not as though the word of God hath
[39:41] taken none
[39:42] effect for they are not all Israel which
[39:46] are of Israel neither because they are
[39:50] the Seed of Abraham are they all
[39:54] children but in Isaac shall th seed be
[40:00] called that is they which are children
[40:04] of the flesh these are not the children
[40:07] of
[40:08] God we need to understand and and and
[40:12] come to a to a a place where God is the
[40:17] absolute amen his word is the
[40:21] absolute and we're going to be looking
[40:23] at something here today that that that
[40:25] truly is going to get us to check our
[40:28] hearts amen and this is they which are
[40:31] children of the promise are counted for
[40:33] the
[40:34] seed the children of the promise are
[40:36] counted for the seed for This Is The
[40:39] Word of Promise at this time will I come
[40:43] and Sarah shall have a son and not only
[40:46] this but when Rebecca also had conceived
[40:50] by one even by Our Father Isaac for the
[40:55] children being not not yet born neither
[40:58] having done any good or evil that the
[41:03] purpose of God according to election
[41:06] might stand not of works but of him that
[41:10] calleth it was said unto her the Elder
[41:14] Shall Serve the younger as it is written
[41:17] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[41:23] wow so here now God is speaking here
[41:28] through through Paul and he's telling us
[41:30] that that God's calling is not based on
[41:36] human
[41:38] genealogy just because you were brought
[41:41] up in in a Catholic church or you know
[41:43] in a in a Catholic Family or a Baptist
[41:45] Church or a Baptist family or or
[41:48] whatever type of religion and and
[41:51] because it's it's called Christianity
[41:53] and because you were born in that that
[41:56] you know your M and and dad were that so
[41:58] you're that you know I talk to people
[42:00] sometimes and say are you a Christian
[42:01] they say well I'm a Catholic or I'm a
[42:04] Baptist I said why well because my
[42:06] parents were Baptists my you know and I
[42:09] was brought up in the church and I went
[42:10] to church and you know that's what I am
[42:14] you see it's it's like today religion is
[42:18] just a
[42:19] membership it's just because I was a
[42:22] part of this so I'm that but here now
[42:25] from the scripture Paul is making it
[42:26] very very clear here that it's not based
[42:30] on genealogy it's not based on the fact
[42:32] that your parents were
[42:35] religious amen it's not based on that
[42:38] it's based on a promise according to his
[42:42] word thank you Jesus and that's the
[42:44] whole thing when we go back right to the
[42:47] very beginning we see that there's this
[42:50] aspect of Jacob have I loved but Esau
[42:53] have I hated because God knew even
[42:56] before while while they were yet in the
[42:59] womb of of R of
[43:03] Rebecca they one was loved and the other
[43:06] one was
[43:08] hated how can that
[43:10] be because God is Sovereign amen praise
[43:15] God and so here now we look at this
[43:20] whole aspect that Isaac a chosen
[43:25] vessel Rebecca a chosen
[43:28] vessel they were
[43:32] supernaturally called of the Lord both
[43:35] were very very dedicated unto the Lord
[43:38] prayed unto the Lord Isaac the son of
[43:41] Abraham knew exactly that he that God
[43:45] had called him and said out of your loin
[43:47] shall come forth all my chosen
[43:51] people very both religious and yet two
[43:54] children are born one hated one loved of
[44:00] God one has
[44:03] representation the other one doesn't
[44:06] look at Cain and
[44:08] Abel one knew exactly how to worship and
[44:12] what was required of the Lord and the
[44:14] other one had no idea and did it all by
[44:18] works
[44:19] amen no
[44:21] revelation of who God actually was and
[44:25] how important it was to know their
[44:33] Birthright Isaac and Ishmael same thing
[44:35] one by promise the other one came by
[44:39] unbelief Sarah disbelieved God
[44:44] when he first came and told her and and
[44:47] Abraham that that they were going to
[44:49] have a son they didn't think it was
[44:52] possible they didn't think that a birth
[44:54] could come out of an old couple like
[44:57] that but yet it was the word of God it
[45:02] was God's word and this is what we need
[45:05] to recognize that God's promises God's
[45:08] word is what has called us what has
[45:10] promised to us what what what our
[45:13] inheritance is who we truly are amen
[45:17] praise God let's read the quote here
[45:19] listen uh in the message serves we would
[45:22] see Jesus oh people are very religious
[45:26] always being as I preached the other
[45:29] night over there a Revival always
[45:32] produces twins like Esau and Jacob a man
[45:36] of the world and the man that desires
[45:39] the
[45:40] birthright see it's always every Revival
[45:44] produces that and this latterday revival
[45:48] has done the same
[45:50] thing and I'm telling you that the same
[45:53] thing is happening right now
[45:57] within this
[46:00] message within the called out churches
[46:03] of the last
[46:05] day every Revival so let's get on the
[46:09] Jacob side the one that's going to
[46:12] inherit the one that's going into the
[46:14] promised land and we cannot be satisfied
[46:18] just with going to church and putting
[46:20] our name on the book if we do there's
[46:23] something wrong let's keep climbing
[46:26] higher and higher till we reach that
[46:28] Promised
[46:30] Land amen praise God in other words we
[46:33] need to we need to check our heart to
[46:35] see if we're really really identified
[46:40] with the word for this day and for this
[46:42] hour I'm not talking about identifying
[46:45] as a Christian we're way down the road
[46:48] like we said last week we we've we've
[46:50] come way down the road
[46:53] Saints there's been a calling in these
[46:56] last days
[46:57] out of the denominational
[47:02] churches we're going to see here that
[47:04] that the that the the denominational
[47:07] churches they're
[47:09] religious but the spirit that's
[47:12] operating in all of those denominations
[47:14] I'm not talking about the people talking
[47:16] about the
[47:18] systems because there's people in there
[47:21] that are going to hear this word and if
[47:24] they have
[47:25] representation in the same way that that
[47:28] that God showed representation according
[47:30] to his word then they will respond to
[47:33] the word of God for this day and this
[47:34] hour and they will identify as a
[47:39] Jacob because they got to come out of
[47:41] the world Listen Jacob was no
[47:44] saint we're going to be seeing
[47:47] here in each and every one of you
[47:50] there's a Jacob and an Esau amen you
[47:52] need to discover which ones got control
[47:54] over you
[47:57] and which one you really are H not easy
[48:01] but this is the time that we're honing
[48:04] into Saints we need to come to a place
[48:06] where we you know where where we know
[48:09] that we know where we're standing amen
[48:11] because when everything starts to fall
[48:13] apart like it is right now in the world
[48:15] and things Israel back in their Homeland
[48:18] Israel at War situations and wars and
[48:21] and and circumstances the way they are
[48:24] right now in the world you need to know
[48:26] where you understand because things are
[48:28] going to happen so
[48:30] quickly that you're going to have to
[48:33] be prayed
[48:35] up we don't
[48:37] pray just when the emergencies come we
[48:41] need to be prayed up so that when the
[48:43] emergencies come we're ready with a
[48:46] sword to overcome by the word of the
[48:49] Lord
[48:50] amen praise God Amen so we want to look
[48:53] at and understand that God is sovereign
[48:56] he knows the end from the
[48:59] beginning he knows where you are right
[49:03] now he knows exactly where your
[49:05] identification is he knows exactly
[49:07] what's stirring in your heart he knows
[49:09] that he knows whether inside of you
[49:12] there's a desire for the word of God
[49:14] burning for for more of him to intervene
[49:18] and intercede in your life amen but the
[49:20] Christian churches today they want to
[49:22] tell you that God is a universal
[49:25] God God God is not a universal God God
[49:28] is God Amen how do they do that by
[49:33] putting their own interpretation on the
[49:35] word they want to have their own
[49:37] doctrines they want to have their own
[49:38] teachings and when you've got your own
[49:41] doctrines and your own teachings what
[49:43] happens Jesus said by your Traditions
[49:47] you make the word of God of none affect
[49:49] the
[49:52] people modern concept of God in this
[49:55] world is what that oh God loves
[49:59] everybody God is love yes he
[50:02] is God is just an old you know God
[50:06] that's sitting on a throne and and and
[50:08] he just you know loves everybody and he
[50:10] just lets you you you can come to me
[50:13] from from Dundas you can come to me from
[50:16] Applebee line you can come to me from
[50:18] Walker's line it doesn't matter which
[50:21] way you come but if you believe that I
[50:24] exist then you can come to to
[50:27] me that's that's nonsense that's not
[50:31] what he
[50:32] says when you search the scriptures you
[50:35] come to realize where Jesus said he that
[50:38] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[50:42] believes what believes that there's a
[50:45] trinity believes that there's doctrines
[50:48] of man that there's uh 14 Stations of
[50:51] the Cross that you can pray to anybody
[50:53] can be a mediator for you that now you
[50:56] can just pray to the Virgin Mary and you
[50:58] can be
[51:01] saved no Jesus said the truth shall set
[51:06] you
[51:07] free trouble today the EV Evangelical
[51:11] Christianity has changed
[51:14] Gods they've created Gods to fit their
[51:18] needs not in this
[51:21] house the god that's revealed in the
[51:23] scripture is the one that can turn
[51:25] around and say Jacob I love Esau I hate
[51:29] because he's got a plan from before the
[51:31] foundations of the world and he knows
[51:34] his own Jesus said my sheep hear my
[51:37] voice no other voice no other man will
[51:41] they follow they will follow
[51:43] me praise God forever more glory to God
[51:48] if we're going to be bowing down to
[51:50] human choice and free will God doesn't
[51:53] bow down to human choice and Free Will
[51:56] you might as well be bowing down to
[51:59] Idols that's all
[52:01] paganism people want to put things in
[52:04] their homes and and and statues and you
[52:07] know they've got so many statues in
[52:08] their house I got you know I I got
[52:10] clients that you know when they when
[52:12] they buy a house the first thing they
[52:13] want to do is put a St Christopher
[52:16] statue in the front or St Francis or
[52:18] something in the front of their house
[52:20] it's nonsense now
[52:24] listen I'm not going to condemn them for
[52:26] it and they shouldn't be condemned for
[52:29] it it's because of tradition it's
[52:32] because of upbringing and that's where
[52:34] their faith is they don't realize one of
[52:36] The Commandments says Thou shalt not
[52:39] worship any false
[52:41] idols and people think oh I'm not
[52:43] worshiping it no if you're putting it
[52:47] there it's because you have faith that
[52:50] God is going to do something for your
[52:52] home because you've put it there right
[52:55] and now you're faith is in putting the
[52:58] idol in front of your home just using
[53:00] that as an
[53:01] example there's all kinds of different
[53:03] Idols people people are worshiping
[53:06] things jobs other
[53:10] people other ministers pastors
[53:15] teachers God requires him and only him
[53:20] to be acknowledged and
[53:22] worshiped thankes it's the very first
[53:25] commandment Thou shalt love the Lord thy
[53:27] God with all thy heart with all thy soul
[53:30] and with all thy might amen praise
[53:35] God so it's not based on our own
[53:37] righteous oh I go to church 20 times a
[53:40] month you could go to church 30 times a
[53:42] month I know people that do they go to
[53:45] church every
[53:46] day that is not going to save
[53:51] them here we've got out of two very very
[53:55] uh uh faithful spiritual mother and
[53:58] father and they bring forth two children
[54:01] one God loves one God hates because God
[54:04] knows the spirit that's
[54:07] behind that seed because if you go back
[54:11] to the Garden of Eden there was two
[54:13] seeds there was a cane and there was an
[54:17] Abel one was from The Serpent and one
[54:20] was from God Amen the Bible says it
[54:25] whether the people want to hear it or
[54:27] not everybody want oh everybody's a
[54:29] child of God everybody's children of God
[54:32] no sir not according to the word of God
[54:35] and when you search the scriptures and
[54:37] you see the evil that comes out of these
[54:41] children of
[54:42] disobedient and what God says about them
[54:46] which is an example right there one he
[54:48] loves one he hates we're going to be
[54:50] looking at their characters we're going
[54:51] to be looking at things and you're going
[54:53] to come to realize whoa
[54:57] where am I identifying
[54:59] here praise God he's his own interpreter
[55:03] let's go to the next slide we're going
[55:04] to read
[55:05] here and we're going to take our time
[55:08] we're going to draw from it what the
[55:09] Lord you know I I've been really
[55:11] rejoicing over some of the things that
[55:13] have you know that the Lord has been
[55:15] showing me through this and I trust that
[55:17] you know that you will you know you
[55:19] you'll be praying and you'll be
[55:20] believing and Isaac entreated the Lord
[55:23] for his wife now Rebecca was barren
[55:27] you can see this you know this same kind
[55:30] of situation all the way down through
[55:33] you know with Abraham and Sarah and now
[55:36] you know Rebecca she couldn't conceive
[55:38] and here Isaac now he entreats the Lord
[55:41] she's Barren and the Lord was intreated
[55:43] of him and Rebecca his wife
[55:46] conceived and the children struggled
[55:49] together within
[55:51] her and she said if it be so why am I
[55:55] thus she went to the Lord and she went
[55:58] to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said
[56:00] unto her two nations are in thy womb and
[56:04] two manner of people shall be separated
[56:08] from thy bowels and the one people shall
[56:10] be stronger than the other people and
[56:12] the Elder Shall Serve the
[56:19] younger and so here now let's continue
[56:24] reading verse 24
[56:27] and when her days to be delivered were
[56:29] fulfilled behold there were twins in her
[56:33] womb and the first came out red all over
[56:37] like a hairy garment and they called his
[56:40] name Esau and after that came his
[56:43] brother out and his hand took hold on
[56:47] Esau's heel and his name was called
[56:50] Jacob and the word and even the name
[56:52] Jacob is heel
[56:54] Grabber okay
[56:57] and Isaac was three scoring years old he
[57:00] was 60 years old when she bare them and
[57:03] the boys grew and Esau was a cunning
[57:06] Hunter a man of the field and Jacob was
[57:10] a plain man dwelling in tense so one was
[57:14] smart one was a
[57:16] hunter and Jacob was just
[57:19] plain simple a mommy's
[57:24] Boy verse
[57:26] 28 and Isaac loved
[57:31] Esau so here you know
[57:34] Isaac because Isaac was under the
[57:36] tradition and the understanding that the
[57:39] first
[57:40] born was the one that would inherit the
[57:43] double portion and the blessing that the
[57:46] blessing would be passed on to the
[57:48] firstborn but did you notice that it was
[57:53] revealed to Rebecca
[57:57] obviously not
[57:59] Isaac interesting and
[58:02] Jacob saw pottage and Esau came from the
[58:06] field and he was faint and Esau said to
[58:10] Jacob feed me I pray thee with that same
[58:13] red pottage for I am faint therefore was
[58:16] his name called Edom and Edam means
[58:22] red and Jacob said sell me this day thy
[58:28] Birthright so here now I want you to
[58:31] notice Jacob has this desire for the
[58:35] right birth the birth right in him is
[58:40] this
[58:41] desire because Jacob was also a conniver
[58:45] and a
[58:46] deceiver he's not born again
[58:49] yet he hasn't had his conversion yet
[58:52] amen but yet there's something in him
[58:56] that just can't get
[58:59] satisfied unless he receives a
[59:03] blessing the
[59:06] blessing to him it may have been a
[59:09] financial
[59:11] blessing but all he knew that was in his
[59:13] heart he was not satisfied I don't know
[59:15] about you you may have been living in
[59:18] this world and you you were going about
[59:20] doing the things that you were doing and
[59:23] and something inside of you could not
[59:25] get fully
[59:27] satisfied that's why we turn to drugs
[59:30] alcohol uh money we're constantly buying
[59:35] new things to satisfy this desire that's
[59:39] within our hearts because we're looking
[59:41] you don't realize it but inside of you
[59:43] there's something to worship that wants
[59:45] to worship and praise and worship God
[59:49] especially if you came from
[59:51] God you didn't know you did you came
[59:54] into this human body and you fall into
[59:56] this
[59:57] Amnesia and then you come to realize
[59:59] wait a minute what's this thing that's
[1:00:02] burning in my heart well something was
[1:00:05] burning in Jacob's heart for that right
[1:00:08] birth and Jacob said sell me this day
[1:00:11] thy birthrights he was a businessman
[1:00:13] sell it to me I'll give you this you
[1:00:15] give me that and Esau said behold I'm at
[1:00:19] point to die and what profit shall this
[1:00:22] Birthright do to me see he had no
[1:00:26] Revelation he figured oh I'm just I'm
[1:00:29] already a son of Isaac I'm already a son
[1:00:32] of of uh of of the promise uh my my
[1:00:36] grandfather was Abraham and I heard
[1:00:38] about all the great things that he that
[1:00:40] he did and I'm part of his
[1:00:42] lineage and because I go to that church
[1:00:45] and because my parents have received the
[1:00:47] prophet then then I'm going to inherit
[1:00:50] those blessings automatically in my life
[1:00:57] not so not
[1:00:59] so and Jacob said swear to me this day
[1:01:03] and he swore unto him and he sold his
[1:01:07] Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave
[1:01:10] Esau bread and pottage and lentils and
[1:01:13] he did eat and drink and Rose up and
[1:01:16] went his way thus Esau despised his
[1:01:21] Birthright it says it right there he
[1:01:23] despised his Birthright
[1:01:27] so in him it
[1:01:30] wasn't it wasn't solidly there there was
[1:01:33] no
[1:01:34] representation because as a son or a
[1:01:36] daughter of God there is no way that
[1:01:40] that you will just surrender to the
[1:01:42] things of this world and give up that
[1:01:44] relationship with God that that that
[1:01:47] representation that he's told you that I
[1:01:50] I I called you from before the
[1:01:52] foundations of the world there's a
[1:01:54] revelation in your heart that that burns
[1:01:57] within your heart that God is your
[1:02:00] absolute you can never leave it amen so
[1:02:04] when we look at this scripture at first
[1:02:06] glance it appears that
[1:02:08] Esau was the one that was smart you know
[1:02:13] his father loved him because he knew how
[1:02:14] to hunt and he would hunt Venison and he
[1:02:16] would cook it just exactly the way his
[1:02:19] father loved it and that's what you know
[1:02:21] that uh pleased Isaac and he figured as
[1:02:24] long as I'm pleasing my father as long
[1:02:26] as I'm I'm doing good and I'm I'm living
[1:02:28] a good you know uh uh life where I'm I'm
[1:02:32] I'm providing for the family you know he
[1:02:34] probably look at Jacob he's always
[1:02:35] hanging out with his mother he's cooking
[1:02:37] lentils you know he's hanging out in the
[1:02:40] tent but yet God had representation in
[1:02:45] Jacob and nothing in
[1:02:49] Esau glory to God Esau was the Elder and
[1:02:54] under under that position he was
[1:02:58] entitled to a double portion and the
[1:03:00] blessing of his father amen Esau
[1:03:04] obviously was
[1:03:06] smart he was
[1:03:08] strong but Jacob was a Mommy's boy the
[1:03:12] Bible said Jacob was plain he would cook
[1:03:15] while Esau was out
[1:03:16] hunting Esau loved by his
[1:03:20] father a man of
[1:03:23] works like many today
[1:03:26] they think that by works they can buy
[1:03:29] themselves into the kingdom of God
[1:03:31] thinking that that's good enough to make
[1:03:33] it into the
[1:03:35] kingdom but yet there was something in
[1:03:38] Esau that
[1:03:40] despised his
[1:03:44] Birthright listen
[1:03:48] here hearing next quote hearing
[1:03:50] recognizing acting on the word of God
[1:03:53] now we are fully acquainted we people
[1:03:56] who search the scriptures day and night
[1:03:58] read our papers and hear the news
[1:04:00] commentators that this world is now
[1:04:03] standing in the grip of two great
[1:04:06] spiritual
[1:04:07] forces we know that there's darkness and
[1:04:11] there's light there's good there's evil
[1:04:13] there's God there's the
[1:04:15] devil Satan is preparing his bride God
[1:04:18] is preparing his
[1:04:21] bride and they are both religious forces
[1:04:25] no matter matter how you look at it
[1:04:27] doesn't matter what even even if they're
[1:04:30] talking New Age movement it's a
[1:04:32] religious
[1:04:34] Force regardless of what religion that
[1:04:37] they teach whether it's Buddhism or or
[1:04:39] Muslim or whatever it is it's a
[1:04:41] religious
[1:04:43] Force the other force is the word of
[1:04:49] God
[1:04:52] period they call it Christianity but but
[1:04:55] they've they've they've taken the word
[1:04:57] and have made it of none effect to the
[1:05:00] people and so it's not a matter of just
[1:05:03] calling it Christianity it's the word of
[1:05:05] God and that's why when we Minister we
[1:05:09] Minister according to the word of
[1:05:11] God this is what sets the people
[1:05:14] free and I believe that these great
[1:05:17] forces are soon coming to a head and
[1:05:20] both these great forces was represented
[1:05:22] in these two sons of Isaac how that God
[1:05:25] in his infinite wisdom has foreshadowed
[1:05:28] all things to us that we might by these
[1:05:31] things know of certain what lays before
[1:05:35] us made it so plain that God and his
[1:05:39] word and the nature and his universe is
[1:05:43] so perfectly arranged together that even
[1:05:46] The Sinner can see something is fixing
[1:05:49] to take place God has so arranged it no
[1:05:53] one is without
[1:05:57] excuse
[1:06:00] next now we see in these two sons that
[1:06:04] when they before they were even born
[1:06:07] they were at war with one
[1:06:09] another even though their virgin mother
[1:06:12] for she was a virgin the beautiful
[1:06:14] Rebecca that married the righteous seed
[1:06:17] of God's promised Isaac that they were
[1:06:20] two consecrated Spirit-filled Believers
[1:06:23] of
[1:06:24] God for ordained to the very marriage
[1:06:27] that they United together by God fornew
[1:06:31] it and how could such a thing come
[1:06:34] through that one mother by one father
[1:06:37] one a very evil person and another a
[1:06:41] very good person and how that the good
[1:06:43] person looked to be evil and the evil
[1:06:46] looked to be
[1:06:48] good I'm telling you there's a lot of
[1:06:51] confusion right now even within the the
[1:06:54] the boundaries of this message
[1:06:57] people are you know if you look at Isaac
[1:06:59] and and and Rebecca you could you can uh
[1:07:02] you know take them as a type of the
[1:07:03] message of this
[1:07:05] hour because every every birth every
[1:07:09] Revival brings forth
[1:07:12] twins amen and there's a struggle that's
[1:07:16] taking place right within the boundaries
[1:07:18] of of this church this called out people
[1:07:24] because it has to
[1:07:26] happen he's he's his program has always
[1:07:29] been the same how could it be that there
[1:07:31] would be some that that that that the
[1:07:34] word of God in in the in these last days
[1:07:36] that it would become so deceiving that
[1:07:38] it would deceive even the very elect if
[1:07:40] it were
[1:07:42] possible because there would have to be
[1:07:44] two Spirits operating within the body of
[1:07:49] the
[1:07:51] church and
[1:07:53] this it shows that the ones that that
[1:07:56] that that seem to be the ones that are
[1:07:58] good that are holding all the great
[1:08:00] meetings and and and doing such
[1:08:03] wonderful works and millions of dollars
[1:08:06] going into all these different places
[1:08:08] and supporting and these are all things
[1:08:10] that are great it's getting the word of
[1:08:12] God out there but the
[1:08:15] Revelation is not that Christ is present
[1:08:20] right now dealing personally with you as
[1:08:22] an
[1:08:24] individual and that you must know that
[1:08:26] you're birthed right and that you've
[1:08:30] received the right birth and the word
[1:08:32] that is transforming your life in order
[1:08:34] to fulfill God's purpose for you in this
[1:08:38] time and season read
[1:08:41] on now that is always has been always
[1:08:46] will be God's program God cannot change
[1:08:49] his program because he makes his program
[1:08:52] perfect because it's part of him in in
[1:08:55] the Garden of Eden sin was so beautiful
[1:08:58] until it attracted Eve from
[1:09:00] righteousness to
[1:09:02] sin and in the same Garden where there
[1:09:05] was a tree of life there was also a tree
[1:09:09] of
[1:09:10] death imagine that from the same Garden
[1:09:14] there was a tree of life and a tree of
[1:09:16] death and from the same same church from
[1:09:21] the same
[1:09:22] Revival how many knows that we're under
[1:09:25] a seven seal Revival right
[1:09:27] now how many realizes that the that the
[1:09:30] seals were open in
[1:09:32] 1963 through the prophet of of
[1:09:35] Revelations 10
[1:09:36] 1-7 the angel messenger the seventh
[1:09:39] Church age messenger William
[1:09:42] Branham and there was a Revival that
[1:09:45] struck the Earth at that
[1:09:47] time but yet I want you to notice that
[1:09:50] at that very time when the Revival
[1:09:53] struck the people started to leave
[1:09:55] William
[1:09:57] brandom but yet it was a supernatural
[1:10:02] event that was only recognized by a
[1:10:07] few only the ones that were destined to
[1:10:12] recognize it those that had pre
[1:10:15] predestinated attributes of God
[1:10:19] himself ordained to be awakened at that
[1:10:23] particular time because God sends his
[1:10:25] word into every dispensation for a
[1:10:28] purpose and for a time and for a
[1:10:31] season and so these two Spirits have
[1:10:34] been operating from before the
[1:10:36] foundations of the
[1:10:39] world the tree of life was Christ and
[1:10:43] the tree of Good and Evil was Satan
[1:10:45] himself
[1:10:47] amen and the world is still feeding off
[1:10:51] of those same two
[1:10:52] trees which tree are you feeding off of
[1:10:57] which one are you of Jesus said I am the
[1:11:00] vine ye are the
[1:11:03] branches and so if you bring forth
[1:11:06] anything in your life when it comes to
[1:11:08] the word of God it's got to be identical
[1:11:11] to what the word is and what the word
[1:11:18] says praise God so Isaac now if we look
[1:11:22] at him he's like a type of the end time
[1:11:24] minister
[1:11:26] hist he was getting
[1:11:29] old we're going to read here many
[1:11:31] message Believers are being obsessed
[1:11:33] over the carnal aspects of brother
[1:11:36] Branham himself instead of the revealed
[1:11:39] word of God for this hour people are
[1:11:42] basing everything that's you know that
[1:11:44] that's the Esau
[1:11:47] spirit that all they want to do is is
[1:11:50] quote brother brandham you you quote it
[1:11:53] exactly the way he says it don't say it
[1:11:55] any other way forget about the fact that
[1:11:58] you need to have your own
[1:12:00] revelation of who you
[1:12:03] are Isaac a type of the message of the
[1:12:06] hour like every patriarch or or who the
[1:12:09] word of the Lord came to this this same
[1:12:12] pattern happened all throughout the
[1:12:14] scriptures whenever God would send his
[1:12:17] word to the
[1:12:18] people the people would either make him
[1:12:22] their Idol and worship him or they would
[1:12:25] follow the word that he was bringing
[1:12:28] forth the pillar of fire like the
[1:12:30] children of
[1:12:31] Israel the pillar of fire would show up
[1:12:34] in the daytime and at night because that
[1:12:38] was their deliverer he was their
[1:12:42] deliverer not the
[1:12:46] man God said they will hearken unto your
[1:12:51] voice it's not moses' voice it's God's
[1:12:56] voice when a prophet comes and stands
[1:12:59] before the people and says thus sayeth
[1:13:01] the Lord that's not the man speaking
[1:13:05] you're hearing his voice but it's being
[1:13:08] said by the
[1:13:10] Lord amen and so Isaac a type of the
[1:13:13] message of the hour and when we look at
[1:13:16] Isaac he was
[1:13:18] old and notice we're going to read now
[1:13:22] we're going to read from Genesis
[1:13:24] 27 notice what's taking place here in
[1:13:28] the in the giving of the
[1:13:32] blessing did you know that Isaac was 60
[1:13:35] years old when he had Jacob and
[1:13:38] Esau and I just you know it just caught
[1:13:41] my attention and here we are 62 years
[1:13:45] after the opening of the
[1:13:48] seals and in
[1:13:50] 1963 there was a there was a Revival
[1:13:53] that broke forth on the opening of that
[1:13:55] seventh
[1:13:57] seal and some people just couldn't take
[1:14:00] it some people still to this day don't
[1:14:03] even believe that it's
[1:14:05] open why because God has not opened it
[1:14:08] to them but there's a people there's a
[1:14:11] there's a
[1:14:12] Jacob that that has a desire for the
[1:14:15] right birth amen and if you and if you
[1:14:19] continue on then that Jacob that's in
[1:14:22] you will be will will have a name change
[1:14:24] that take place and you'll be converted
[1:14:28] to realize that you're actually
[1:14:30] Israel God's promise God's promised
[1:14:33] people God's elected
[1:14:36] people amen praise God the bride's
[1:14:40] Revival is based on the
[1:14:43] word not a
[1:14:45] prophet I want to repeat that the
[1:14:49] bride's Revival is not based on a man
[1:14:53] it's based on the the word of God that
[1:14:56] came through the man
[1:15:00] amen
[1:15:02] hallelujah we were like Esau when we
[1:15:04] first came
[1:15:07] in because we thought
[1:15:09] oh works I got to go to church I gotta
[1:15:14] be there I got to do this I gotta uh you
[1:15:16] know I got to live right I gotta I gotta
[1:15:18] do all it's all all all work spirit that
[1:15:21] that you know when you first come in but
[1:15:24] inside the was was a Jacob that had a
[1:15:27] desire for the word of God you didn't
[1:15:29] know it until God spoke to you and
[1:15:32] awakened you out of your
[1:15:35] Amnesia
[1:15:37] amen so here
[1:15:40] now we come to realize that Esau's
[1:15:44] spirit is all about works and Jacob is
[1:15:46] all about the birthright Jacob got the
[1:15:49] blessing that could never be changed now
[1:15:51] let's read it Genesis 27 17 to
[1:15:56] 20 we're getting to something here stay
[1:15:59] with me and she gave the Savory meat and
[1:16:02] the bread which she had prepared into
[1:16:05] the hand of her son Jacob because she
[1:16:08] had heard okay she had heard what Isaac
[1:16:13] had just told Esau to go and get him
[1:16:17] some venison prepare it because he was
[1:16:20] feeling like it was his time his end was
[1:16:23] coming and it was time for him him to
[1:16:25] give the blessing to his son and so here
[1:16:29] now she had prepared into the hand of
[1:16:32] her son Jacob and she came unto and he
[1:16:35] came unto his father and said my father
[1:16:39] and he said Here Am I who art thou my
[1:16:42] son and Jacob said unto his father I am
[1:16:46] Esau see he was a liar he didn't care
[1:16:48] what he had to
[1:16:50] do it didn't matter he wanted the
[1:16:53] birthright he amen I am Esau thy
[1:16:57] firstborn I have done according as thou
[1:17:00] baest me arise I pray thee sit and eat
[1:17:04] of my venison that thy soul may bless
[1:17:07] thee and Isaac said unto his son how is
[1:17:11] it that thou has found it so quickly my
[1:17:13] son he was surprised that all of a
[1:17:16] sudden you know because he had just told
[1:17:17] Isaac but listen what he
[1:17:20] says because the Lord thy God brought it
[1:17:23] to me
[1:17:25] that you think he was
[1:17:26] lying no I don't think no you see God
[1:17:30] had spoken to ra uh uh
[1:17:34] Rebecca and made it very clear to her
[1:17:36] that that the younger was going to serve
[1:17:39] the older she had a revelation of
[1:17:41] this and so she was led by God that's
[1:17:45] why she went to to Jacob and she says
[1:17:47] Now you listen to what I'm going to tell
[1:17:48] you I'm going to command you what you
[1:17:50] have to do and Jacob if you go back and
[1:17:53] read Jacob was afraid he says wait a
[1:17:55] minute how can I do that you know he's
[1:17:56] going to recognize this and that no you
[1:17:59] listen to what I'm going to tell you you
[1:18:01] do what I'm going to tell you and
[1:18:04] Jacob he he obeyed and it was God
[1:18:08] actually that that that placed it on him
[1:18:11] to do what he had to do amen sometimes
[1:18:15] you're wondering about your life and
[1:18:16] you're wondering why I did this and why
[1:18:19] did I have to go this way and why did I
[1:18:21] have to go that way God was directing
[1:18:23] you and leading you to your promised
[1:18:28] word I have I asked the Lord all the
[1:18:31] time you waited till I was 33 years old
[1:18:34] before you came and intervened in my
[1:18:35] life and what a
[1:18:37] mess what a
[1:18:39] mess but God had a purpose in it all now
[1:18:44] I can really identify with
[1:18:47] Jacob
[1:18:49] amen let's read on and Isaac said unto
[1:18:53] Jacob come near me I pray thee that I
[1:18:56] may feel thee my son whether thou be my
[1:18:58] very son Esau or not see he was
[1:19:01] questioning in in his
[1:19:03] mind just like within the message of the
[1:19:06] hour there's there there there's
[1:19:08] questioning going on right now amongst
[1:19:11] amongst the Believers you know there's
[1:19:13] fighting going on amongst the Believers
[1:19:15] there's there's there's you know uh the
[1:19:18] the headquarters of of this message a
[1:19:21] worldwide you know uh Corporation that's
[1:19:25] doing such great things but yet there's
[1:19:27] confusion within the body of that of
[1:19:31] this
[1:19:32] ministry think about it Saints Isaac was
[1:19:36] old he was you know this message it's
[1:19:39] already 63 years
[1:19:41] old I'm talking about the the
[1:19:44] Revival of the opening of those Seven
[1:19:47] Seals because that's what we're under
[1:19:50] that's what's placing us that's what's
[1:19:51] identifying
[1:19:53] us that's the church that we've been
[1:19:55] called to under that seventh seal
[1:19:59] Church you need to study we're going to
[1:20:01] be doing a complete study on the Seven
[1:20:03] Seals it's all coming up I'm excited
[1:20:05] about
[1:20:07] it he says and Jacob went near unto
[1:20:11] Isaac his father and he felt him and
[1:20:13] said the voice is Jacob's
[1:20:16] voice but the hands are the hands of
[1:20:19] Esau because Rebecca had put you know
[1:20:22] the hair because Esau was such a hairy
[1:20:24] person and Rebecca had covered him put a
[1:20:27] covering on him to disguise
[1:20:31] him and he discerned him
[1:20:36] not you see that he discerned him not he
[1:20:40] was not able to identify because God had
[1:20:45] already made it clear that the blessing
[1:20:48] was going to go to Jacob
[1:20:50] regardless and you cannot override God's
[1:20:54] purpose and plan and even you as a son
[1:20:57] or a daughter of God you will not be
[1:21:01] confused the word will become plain to
[1:21:04] you you will know exactly who you are
[1:21:07] where you stand in the word of God in
[1:21:09] this day and in this hour and you will
[1:21:10] not fall to the confusion that is even
[1:21:14] taking place within the message of this
[1:21:18] hour than and he discerned him not
[1:21:22] because his hands were hairy and his
[1:21:24] brother Esau's
[1:21:26] hands as his brother Esau's hands so he
[1:21:29] blessed
[1:21:42] him so I want you to realize here that
[1:21:46] Isaac was under the anointing of
[1:21:49] God whether he was old whether he was in
[1:21:52] the condition he was in it it all had a
[1:21:55] purpose because the scripture says in
[1:21:58] Hebrews 11:20 by faith Isaac blessed
[1:22:03] Jacob and Esau concerning things to come
[1:22:07] even Esau received his
[1:22:10] Blessing but the blessing was to Jacob
[1:22:13] and it was through him that the nations
[1:22:15] of the world would
[1:22:17] continue God's chosen
[1:22:20] Nation amen so yet the Lord through
[1:22:24] Jacob a deceiver had different
[1:22:28] plans than what Isaac himself even
[1:22:36] knew let's read the next
[1:22:40] quote and that Spirit of that one birth
[1:22:44] is still
[1:22:46] represented in the world today and it's
[1:22:50] coming to a head now the spiritual
[1:22:53] believer and the carnal believer carnal
[1:22:56] believer no one could say they wasn't
[1:22:59] both
[1:23:00] religious they're both
[1:23:03] religious people within the Christian
[1:23:06] church and within this church and every
[1:23:09] message Church they're religious in
[1:23:15] their carnal spiritual
[1:23:18] battle amen spiritual believer and
[1:23:21] carnal believer no one could say they
[1:23:24] wasn't both religious they were they
[1:23:27] didn't say that one served an idol and
[1:23:30] the other one God they were both
[1:23:33] Servants of God now pay close attention
[1:23:36] to the scriptures now on this subject
[1:23:39] because I'm sure it'll help you see now
[1:23:42] not everyone that saith Lord Lord will
[1:23:45] enter in but the one that doeth the will
[1:23:48] of My Father which is in
[1:23:51] heaven now if you notice Jacob had one
[1:23:54] thing that he wanted because according
[1:23:57] to the word the blessing and the good
[1:24:00] thing laid in the birth right and that's
[1:24:03] one thing that you as a true son or
[1:24:07] daughter of God you will desire to know
[1:24:10] the word to have an experience with the
[1:24:15] word a real experience with God Amen
[1:24:19] praise God and
[1:24:21] so uh he goes on here and he makes it
[1:24:26] very clear that the
[1:24:28] blessing is in the
[1:24:30] birthright so
[1:24:33] now
[1:24:35] Esau
[1:24:37] separates from
[1:24:39] Jacob God shows Isaac now to
[1:24:44] call
[1:24:48] Jacob before we go to that Hebrews 12:14
[1:24:52] the next scripture here I want you to
[1:24:54] notice something here that Esau in his
[1:24:57] condition he came and wanted the
[1:25:01] blessing he wanted to receive the
[1:25:04] blessing from
[1:25:07] God and so it shows here follow peace
[1:25:10] with all men in Holiness without which
[1:25:12] no man shall see the Lord looking
[1:25:15] diligently lest any man fail of the
[1:25:17] grace of God lest any root of bitterness
[1:25:20] springing up trouble you and thereby uh
[1:25:24] many be defiled he's talking about you
[1:25:26] know your own Spirit be aware lest there
[1:25:30] be any fornicator or profane person as
[1:25:33] Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his
[1:25:37] Birthright for you know how that
[1:25:40] afterwards when he would have inherited
[1:25:42] the blessing he was rejected for he
[1:25:45] found no place of repentance though he
[1:25:48] sought it carefully with
[1:25:51] tears there's going to be many that are
[1:25:53] going to come right to the last day that
[1:25:55] are going to realize that they didn't
[1:25:57] have the right
[1:25:58] birth that there was nothing that they
[1:26:01] could do to get
[1:26:02] it because God by
[1:26:05] election God by predestination has
[1:26:08] called each and every one of you
[1:26:11] individually
[1:26:12] amen and you're and you've got this
[1:26:15] struggle that's within
[1:26:17] you which is the two
[1:26:20] Natures your greatest battle is going to
[1:26:22] always be in your mind
[1:26:25] because that Esau spirit that Esau
[1:26:28] nature will emotionalize with the world
[1:26:31] but the Jacob nature will want the word
[1:26:34] of
[1:26:34] God
[1:26:38] Amen and so Paul said when I am trying
[1:26:42] to do good because of these two Natures
[1:26:44] that were constantly there Paul said he
[1:26:48] says uh when I'm trying to do good evil
[1:26:50] is present it's these two Natures
[1:26:53] fighting within you
[1:26:55] the Beast nature which was injected back
[1:26:58] in the Garden of Eden through the
[1:26:59] original sin and then the nature of
[1:27:02] Christ which is in that attribute that's
[1:27:05] been with you and in you from before the
[1:27:07] foundations of the world and you cannot
[1:27:10] suppress God's attributes
[1:27:15] amen the denominational religions
[1:27:18] especially the Catholic Church they you
[1:27:21] know uh the the all the the the
[1:27:23] Protestant churches they all have a very
[1:27:26] strong Esau spirit it's all about works
[1:27:30] and it's
[1:27:31] true you see whenever there's any
[1:27:33] natural disasters that take place these
[1:27:36] people can send millions and millions of
[1:27:38] dollars in Aid you've got the Salvation
[1:27:40] Army they can do all those things but
[1:27:43] those are religious organizations with
[1:27:46] an Esau spirit because the moment that
[1:27:48] you bring them the pure unadulterated
[1:27:51] word of God they despise it
[1:27:55] you tell them about the New Birth have
[1:27:57] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:27:59] believed and they turn around and
[1:28:02] say I was B I was baptized as a
[1:28:06] baby that's not what we're
[1:28:09] asking do you want the right birth
[1:28:12] because if you get the right birth
[1:28:14] you're going to have the right
[1:28:16] heart you're going to be able to live
[1:28:18] for Christ because you love him you've
[1:28:20] fallen in love with him you've you've
[1:28:22] come into a relationship with him him
[1:28:25] amen the problem is regardless they can
[1:28:30] never have a Jacob Spirit they could
[1:28:33] never have that desire for the right
[1:28:35] birth because it was not placed in them
[1:28:38] from before the foundations of the
[1:28:42] world the biggest deception in this hour
[1:28:46] and even within the the ranks of this
[1:28:48] message is getting people to preach the
[1:28:51] the the same things over and over that
[1:28:53] the prophet
[1:28:55] preached but it's not about just quoting
[1:28:59] the prophet or listening to the prophet
[1:29:02] it's having a revelation of what the
[1:29:03] prophet was saying and the word of God
[1:29:06] that he was fulfilling in his day in
[1:29:09] order to bring our
[1:29:12] day not having a revelation of the
[1:29:15] current message still surrounding that
[1:29:18] Birthright because remember every
[1:29:21] message is the Holy Ghost in its day to
[1:29:25] birth Sons and Daughters of God to the
[1:29:28] to what God is doing
[1:29:30] now that's what the word is sent
[1:29:34] for every
[1:29:37] dispensation has a word that's going to
[1:29:40] Quicken the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:29:43] into their position in the word of God
[1:29:46] Amen it's always being about the
[1:29:49] birthright that is why when Jesus was on
[1:29:52] Earth he said you must be Born Again
[1:29:56] people are putting the Born Again
[1:29:57] experience based on God sent a prophet
[1:30:01] the Seven Seals were
[1:30:03] open but they're not basing it on an
[1:30:06] experience and a reality amen they'll
[1:30:10] base it on an altar call because they
[1:30:11] went to a to a to a youth camp or or
[1:30:14] they went to some special camp meetings
[1:30:16] and and there was an altar call and they
[1:30:18] they went to the Altar and they and they
[1:30:20] figured that that that was good enough
[1:30:22] you need to know that you know that that
[1:30:25] there's a reality to God's word that has
[1:30:28] called you and placed you into the local
[1:30:30] Body of
[1:30:32] Christ to fulfill your part in the word
[1:30:34] of
[1:30:37] God accepting the word for your
[1:30:40] day but you know the word without
[1:30:43] Revelation it'll never stand in your
[1:30:45] life you can impersonate all you want
[1:30:49] you'll never be
[1:30:50] satisfied you'll fuss and you'll fight
[1:30:54] you'll fuss and fight over quotes you'll
[1:30:56] fuss and fight over
[1:30:58] scripture but the true son the true
[1:31:01] daughter of God they're not
[1:31:03] Fighters they're
[1:31:05] Believers and they know that the word is
[1:31:07] not something that you can give to
[1:31:09] somebody it's God that opens the
[1:31:12] understanding it's God that
[1:31:14] awakens and brings you into your
[1:31:16] position amen the reality of the word
[1:31:20] the open book it's become a reality in
[1:31:23] your life amen it's not about preaching
[1:31:26] signs and wonders and
[1:31:30] miracles it's about God coming personal
[1:31:33] to you knowing that he's a reality
[1:31:37] amen revealed to you
[1:31:40] personal signs and wonders they were all
[1:31:43] under the first and second pull of the
[1:31:47] Prophet it was all to the
[1:31:50] flesh to the mind
[1:31:54] but the third pull is about the
[1:31:56] attribute the election that's in
[1:32:00] you the one that God says I love yes the
[1:32:04] one that's ordained to eternal life
[1:32:07] can't miss it even if you wanted to miss
[1:32:09] it amen a true son or daughter of God
[1:32:13] will desire the word and never deny
[1:32:16] it there's no way that they could ever
[1:32:19] deny
[1:32:20] it and we're not talking about being
[1:32:22] religious because religion is only a
[1:32:24] covering a True Believer will desire the
[1:32:28] word and believe the word and believe
[1:32:31] the word for their
[1:32:33] day they'll want to know what God is
[1:32:35] doing
[1:32:36] now not what God is going to do down the
[1:32:39] road not what God has done in the past
[1:32:41] but wanting to know exactly what God is
[1:32:43] doing right now in my
[1:32:46] life amen praise God you might be a
[1:32:49] Jacob right now that isn't living right
[1:32:54] you'll still lie you'll still cheat but
[1:32:57] when it comes down to it you will
[1:33:00] eventually submit to God's word you will
[1:33:04] surrender to God's will in your life you
[1:33:07] will come to a place where you will have
[1:33:09] to surrender because the enemy will
[1:33:11] surround you you know that when when
[1:33:13] when
[1:33:14] sin is at your door it's because you're
[1:33:18] you're entertaining
[1:33:20] things you're either trying to do right
[1:33:23] or you've gone right into the devil's
[1:33:26] backyard and you've opened yourself to
[1:33:29] to to attacks of the
[1:33:31] enemy but God will bring his word right
[1:33:34] back regardless of your
[1:33:37] condition
[1:33:40] Hallelujah let's go to our next
[1:33:42] scripture
[1:33:45] here Genesis
[1:33:48] 32 verse 22 now here now we're going to
[1:33:53] see Jacob 's conversion and he rose up
[1:33:56] that night and took his two wives and
[1:33:59] his two women servants and his 11 sons
[1:34:03] and passed over the Ford Jabbok and he
[1:34:08] took them and sent them over the brook
[1:34:11] and sent over that he had and Jacob was
[1:34:14] left alone and there Wrestled a man with
[1:34:18] him until the breaking of
[1:34:22] day next and when he saw that he
[1:34:25] prevailed not against him he touched the
[1:34:29] hollow of his thigh now this is where
[1:34:31] Jacob gets sent Now by his father to
[1:34:35] leave Canaan and to go and find himself
[1:34:39] a
[1:34:40] wife
[1:34:42] okay and he and so he he goes and he's
[1:34:46] he's on his road and he had to travel
[1:34:48] over 400 miles and he's on his
[1:34:51] road to go and find himself a wife
[1:34:54] and while he's on this journey I want
[1:34:56] you to see yourselves in in in your
[1:35:00] journey where you actually meet God
[1:35:03] because he met he met God and when he
[1:35:05] saw that he prevailed not against him
[1:35:08] the Lord touched the hollow of his thigh
[1:35:11] and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out
[1:35:13] of joint and he wrestled with him and he
[1:35:15] said let me go for the day breth and he
[1:35:18] said I will not let thee go except thou
[1:35:21] bless me you see Jacob had come to a
[1:35:24] place where he knew that God had given
[1:35:26] him the blessing and now he was
[1:35:29] wrestling with God and you're going to
[1:35:30] come to a place in your walk where
[1:35:33] you're going to have to wrestle with God
[1:35:35] you're going to have to overcome all the
[1:35:37] old nature all the things that have held
[1:35:40] you down and have have have uh been a
[1:35:43] hindrance in your life and you're going
[1:35:45] to have to trust God you're going to
[1:35:47] have to stay there until God fully
[1:35:49] delivers
[1:35:51] you amen and he says I'm not going to
[1:35:54] let you let you go except thou bless me
[1:35:56] and he said unto him what is thy name
[1:35:58] and he said Jacob and he said thy name
[1:36:01] shall be called No More Jacob but Israel
[1:36:04] for as a prince hast thou power with God
[1:36:08] and with men and has prevailed amen
[1:36:12] praise God hallelujah so what are we
[1:36:15] seeing here we're seeing something let's
[1:36:19] read the next
[1:36:21] quote and Jacob in the message
[1:36:24] desperations and Jacob rather in
[1:36:27] desperation he said I know I feeled you
[1:36:31] you're here with me but I'm not going to
[1:36:33] let you go somebody sees it fine the
[1:36:37] first little sensation and they get up
[1:36:39] and jump up and down run up the aisle
[1:36:42] and say I got it I got it he says oh no
[1:36:45] uh-uh no Jacob stayed there until
[1:36:49] something happened that made him walk
[1:36:52] different made him a different person
[1:36:55] because that he stayed until that
[1:36:59] happened and you're going to need to get
[1:37:02] desperate in your walk with God if you
[1:37:03] want to really know that you know you're
[1:37:05] going to need to come to a place where
[1:37:07] you are ready to to to completely
[1:37:11] surrender unto the
[1:37:12] Lord
[1:37:15] amen not just by one sensation not by
[1:37:18] just one experience but that you will
[1:37:21] you'll you'll keep pressing on and
[1:37:23] pressing through to know that God is is
[1:37:26] definitely a part of your life and has a
[1:37:29] desire and a plan for you amen glory to
[1:37:33] God and so Jacob stayed there until
[1:37:36] something happened that made him walk
[1:37:38] different made him a different person
[1:37:40] because that he stayed until that
[1:37:43] happened and he was able the Bible says
[1:37:46] he held until he prevailed he can he can
[1:37:50] a man how can a man Prevail over God but
[1:37:53] you can do it you can do it a man can
[1:37:57] Prevail over God if you stay there long
[1:38:00] enough if you have that desire within
[1:38:03] your heart to overcome those situations
[1:38:06] in your life and you need the Lord to to
[1:38:09] set you free and deliver you from those
[1:38:11] those circumstances those bondages those
[1:38:14] bad experiences those things that that
[1:38:17] that that have held you back traditions
[1:38:21] of your past genealogy and your you're
[1:38:23] you know this is something that came
[1:38:26] down from my mom or my dad no you are
[1:38:29] born again you're a brand new creation
[1:38:31] in
[1:38:33] Christ and you can Prevail with God if
[1:38:36] you will stay there and trust him and go
[1:38:39] through amen praise God hallelujah our
[1:38:43] churches need to have individuals with
[1:38:45] real genuine births amen with changed
[1:38:50] new hearts and our children need to be
[1:38:52] born again too just like you like every
[1:38:56] true son and daughter of God needs to be
[1:38:58] born again so does our children have to
[1:39:01] be born again amen parents you need to
[1:39:06] set the right example you need to come
[1:39:08] into the real understanding of our kids
[1:39:11] you you could bring them kids up with so
[1:39:14] much
[1:39:17] impersonation you want to you want to
[1:39:19] make them you know self-righteous do you
[1:39:21] realize that that's what that does is
[1:39:23] when you force them that you got to live
[1:39:26] this way you got to dress this way you
[1:39:28] you when you go to school you got to
[1:39:30] dress this way and you got to be this
[1:39:32] way and you know and and you're and what
[1:39:34] you're actually doing is you're teaching
[1:39:36] them
[1:39:38] self-righteousness instead of allowing
[1:39:40] them to just experience the atmosphere
[1:39:45] that you
[1:39:46] create in your personal relationship
[1:39:49] with
[1:39:51] God this relationship is not based on
[1:39:55] law are you telling me that we got to
[1:39:58] serve God because we have
[1:40:01] to that's not a relationship with God
[1:40:04] you know what that produces an Esau
[1:40:07] spirit because all of a sudden it's all
[1:40:09] about
[1:40:10] works oh I go to church that's good
[1:40:13] enough no they need to have their own
[1:40:16] experience they're going to need to
[1:40:18] repent at some point of something and
[1:40:21] I'm not saying they got to go out there
[1:40:23] in sin that's not what I'm saying but
[1:40:25] you need to understand that the true
[1:40:28] Born Again experience is not something
[1:40:31] that we create in our
[1:40:34] children Jacob and and Rebecca had two
[1:40:38] sons or uh Isaac and Rebecca had two
[1:40:41] sons and one was a conniver and the
[1:40:42] other one was was a was a a a somebody
[1:40:46] that
[1:40:48] wanted despised his
[1:40:51] Birthright but yet in in one of those
[1:40:54] children there was
[1:40:56] election and even though they that you
[1:40:59] know some of our children and some of
[1:41:01] you you still acting out that e that
[1:41:04] that Jacob spirit in your lives where
[1:41:07] you're in that that condition and some
[1:41:09] of our children are in that condition
[1:41:11] where they're they're they're they're
[1:41:12] connivers or whatever you know they'll
[1:41:15] come and lie right to your face and you
[1:41:18] know that they're
[1:41:19] lying but understand that if God wants
[1:41:22] to get a hold of them them they will
[1:41:25] change and they will have a genuine
[1:41:28] birth amen praise God
[1:41:32] Allelujah people in the message churches
[1:41:35] have many actors in
[1:41:38] them there's more actors there's more
[1:41:40] Esau actors than there are actual
[1:41:43] Desiring the the pure unadulterated word
[1:41:46] of
[1:41:48] God
[1:41:50] Impostors things coming into the
[1:41:52] churches the love of money and and and
[1:41:55] and breaking up you know churches and
[1:41:57] brothers fighting against brothers and
[1:42:00] all kind because Satan this is the hour
[1:42:03] where it would be so deceiving that it
[1:42:04] would deceive the very elect the Bible
[1:42:07] said that Esau hated
[1:42:11] Jacob now could a son or daughter of God
[1:42:15] actually hate his brother or sister if
[1:42:18] you're a son or a daughter of God in
[1:42:20] this message no way you you're not going
[1:42:23] to get caught up into the fighting and
[1:42:25] into the fussing of the message and and
[1:42:28] start fighting over this and fighting
[1:42:30] over that that's all
[1:42:33] Pride that's all Pride that's got a hold
[1:42:35] of the
[1:42:37] people this is a reality to the true
[1:42:40] Sons and Daughters of God and their
[1:42:43] desire is strictly for the
[1:42:46] word to recognize what their part in the
[1:42:49] word
[1:42:50] is amen you're your soul is the nature
[1:42:55] that is in you and if there's a lust or
[1:42:57] a pride Spirit or whatever it is in that
[1:43:01] in that nature it needs to be it needs
[1:43:04] to be
[1:43:06] annihilated and only the true birth can
[1:43:09] do
[1:43:10] that
[1:43:12] amen you need Christ if you're going to
[1:43:15] make it out of
[1:43:16] here no other way Sons and Daughters of
[1:43:19] God and Jesus took all of our sin
[1:43:24] and nailed it to the Cross so don't you
[1:43:26] be trying to do it
[1:43:28] yourself you need to accept what he's
[1:43:31] already
[1:43:32] done amen praise God only then will you
[1:43:35] be able to give him your
[1:43:38] heart
[1:43:41] Hallelujah if I was to ask you know a
[1:43:43] lot of you young people in
[1:43:46] here do you have a desire to be the wife
[1:43:50] of a deacon
[1:43:53] or a
[1:43:55] deacon or a
[1:43:59] minister or a minister's
[1:44:03] wife is that what like think about it
[1:44:07] this
[1:44:08] message is the
[1:44:10] message of the Rapture it's the only
[1:44:14] message that will bring perfect faith
[1:44:17] for the
[1:44:18] Rapture and if you've got a true desire
[1:44:21] in your heart for this word you will
[1:44:24] stay within the boundaries of the word
[1:44:28] you will not desire to go outside of
[1:44:31] this
[1:44:32] word why do you think Isaac made it so
[1:44:35] clear when he would tell his his uh his
[1:44:37] son and he' say go and find yourself a
[1:44:40] wife and go and find her out of our own
[1:44:47] body now we know that that God works I I
[1:44:50] was telling my wife I said my God I said
[1:44:52] look at the the grace of God in our
[1:44:55] lives that God we didn't even know
[1:44:59] anything about God we didn't know
[1:45:01] nothing about this message we knew
[1:45:03] nothing and God led us and and and you
[1:45:07] know our paths came together we had to
[1:45:10] come together today we're husband and
[1:45:12] wife after 39 years and we're in the
[1:45:15] service of the Lord that was just pure
[1:45:18] grace and God can do that anytime he
[1:45:20] wants to do it amen praise
[1:45:24] God but we are honing down now we're
[1:45:27] coming into the final
[1:45:29] stretch of this word of this revelation
[1:45:32] of the true
[1:45:34] church and people are are are are are
[1:45:37] are are falling away leaving the message
[1:45:41] believing that now believing that God
[1:45:43] never even sent a prophet not believing
[1:45:45] the cloud in
[1:45:47] 1963 they're they're they're just
[1:45:49] leaving the message because they have no
[1:45:52] true revelation of the
[1:45:55] message but if you have a true
[1:45:57] revelation of this message you will know
[1:45:59] that there's absolutely nowhere for you
[1:46:02] to
[1:46:05] go but they put on so much law on the
[1:46:11] people and and and and they're coming to
[1:46:13] church and their only purpose in going
[1:46:15] to church is because they have to
[1:46:18] go that's not the kind of relationship
[1:46:21] that God is is having right now with his
[1:46:24] true church amen glory to
[1:46:30] God we don't have to pressure people we
[1:46:33] don't have to pressure our children we
[1:46:35] don't have to pressure nobody God adds
[1:46:38] to the church such as should be
[1:46:41] saved and as long as we are preaching
[1:46:44] the pure unadulterated word of God from
[1:46:46] this Pulpit then we will have children
[1:46:50] that will be birthed by the word of God
[1:46:54] because if they have representation they
[1:46:56] have to come Jesus said all that the
[1:46:58] father hath given me will
[1:47:01] come we don't need to be a dictator I
[1:47:04] thank God for our pastor our former
[1:47:07] Pastor John Simon that he allowed us to
[1:47:10] walk with God he allowed us to have our
[1:47:12] own experiences with God he allowed us
[1:47:15] to make the mistakes that we had to make
[1:47:18] amen praise God a real Pastor has a
[1:47:22] desire to see births see genuine uh uh
[1:47:26] transformation taking place within the
[1:47:28] lives of the people not dictators not
[1:47:32] you know that you know a pastor that
[1:47:34] that puts so much law on the people is
[1:47:37] because he's afraid he's afraid of the
[1:47:40] reproach he doesn't want to have to deal
[1:47:41] with broken lives and he doesn't want to
[1:47:43] have to deal with broken
[1:47:46] situations but listen as long as I'm the
[1:47:49] pastor of this church I am going to
[1:47:51] preach the word of God
[1:47:53] and the word of God will call and place
[1:47:56] every single son and daughter of God
[1:47:59] according to God's purpose and plan
[1:48:02] amen that's all that I'm obligated to
[1:48:05] do I'm just like you just like anybody
[1:48:08] else I need God to feed me so that I can
[1:48:11] feed you amen I'm feeding on the word of
[1:48:14] God I I I read the word of God I'm just
[1:48:17] I'm I'm just uh you know Desiring to
[1:48:20] know that that you know there's a
[1:48:22] constant indication that God is in our
[1:48:24] midst amen and God will add to the
[1:48:27] church God will deal with the
[1:48:29] individuals in this church I don't have
[1:48:31] to go babysitting and watching your
[1:48:33] lives and what you're doing and
[1:48:35] questioning you about this or
[1:48:36] questioning you about
[1:48:38] that that's not a real true experience
[1:48:41] with
[1:48:42] God you've got to come into your own
[1:48:45] walk with God your own personal
[1:48:47] relationship amen glory to God a
[1:48:51] Shepherd he's he's fearless and he's not
[1:48:55] afraid to get
[1:48:56] messed he's not a I'm not afraid of of
[1:49:01] mess I'm telling you right now if we
[1:49:04] ever go to war I'm I'm one of the guys
[1:49:06] you want on your team I'll be the first
[1:49:09] one on the field and I'll be the last
[1:49:11] one off because I trust in the Living
[1:49:15] God God will keep us just like he said
[1:49:19] to Joshua be strong and courageous I'll
[1:49:23] be with you I'll be with you even un the
[1:49:25] end I believe that that same God is with
[1:49:27] us here
[1:49:29] today and if we can believe that word
[1:49:31] and trust him in that way then we will
[1:49:33] not surrender to the enemy we will not
[1:49:37] allow the enemy to take our children we
[1:49:39] will not allow the enemy to take any not
[1:49:42] one hoof amen praise
[1:49:45] God we're going to trust him we're going
[1:49:47] to we're going to walk with him but
[1:49:49] we're going to allow God to deal with
[1:49:51] each one of us
[1:49:56] individually glory to
[1:49:59] God thank you
[1:50:02] Lord this is the hour of maturity
[1:50:06] Saints the bride's Revival for this
[1:50:10] hour let the musicians
[1:50:14] come started in
[1:50:17] 1963 we're going to finish this next
[1:50:19] week
[1:50:21] okay the Revival started in 1963 with
[1:50:25] the opening of the seventh
[1:50:29] seal now this is why we are going to be
[1:50:31] going into a full study of the Seven
[1:50:35] Seals and we are going to be trusting
[1:50:37] the Lord that he's going to reveal to us
[1:50:41] exactly where each and every one of us
[1:50:45] are placed within the body of Christ
[1:50:47] because that's what the seventh seal
[1:50:50] does remember the seventh seal was the
[1:50:54] coming of the Lord it was him coming to
[1:50:58] the Earth to take possession of a
[1:51:00] five-fold Ministry it was no longer
[1:51:03] going to be a one-man Ministry the
[1:51:06] prophet had to decrease so that he could
[1:51:10] increase and that's why this this
[1:51:12] message for this day and for this hour
[1:51:15] is not about that God sent a prophet
[1:51:18] it's about that God sent a prophet so
[1:51:21] that Christ could come and open the
[1:51:23] seals so that he could reveal the
[1:51:26] mystery that he's been holding in the
[1:51:28] back of his mind from before the
[1:51:30] foundations of the world and that is
[1:51:32] that he's going to have a people that
[1:51:35] are going to be
[1:51:36] consecrated called placed know exactly
[1:51:40] who they are where they fit in the word
[1:51:42] of God who they are are in in the local
[1:51:47] body oh we're going to hone this right
[1:51:49] down we're going to want listen you
[1:51:51] didn't get called to this church Church
[1:51:53] to be a church
[1:51:56] member yeah we hear in every Church
[1:51:59] there's three kinds of Believers guess
[1:52:01] what we don't need those unbelievers and
[1:52:04] make Believers in
[1:52:05] here we need True Believers that are
[1:52:08] going to surrender their lives and give
[1:52:10] themselves completely holy over unto the
[1:52:13] Lord because this is the quick short
[1:52:15] work that we're entering into now this
[1:52:18] is the time where the bride has taken
[1:52:20] the book she knows the word has been
[1:52:22] open to her she recognizes her position
[1:52:25] in the word she realizes that now she's
[1:52:28] the one that's actually Christ on Earth
[1:52:31] speaking his word bringing to pass
[1:52:34] calling placing positioning perfecting
[1:52:37] the body until they all come into the
[1:52:40] unity of
[1:52:41] Christ she's the one that's come into
[1:52:44] that
[1:52:45] position and that's the only Revival
[1:52:48] that is now taking place
[1:52:53] and it will cause a
[1:52:56] separation yes it's going to cause a
[1:53:00] separation you're you're going to you're
[1:53:02] going to know the difference not because
[1:53:05] I'm telling you because the spirit of
[1:53:07] God is going to come upon you and it's
[1:53:09] going to open the understanding in such
[1:53:11] a way where you are going to realize
[1:53:13] that now you know as the word progresses
[1:53:16] remember the the Lord raises a standard
[1:53:19] God is his own interpreter how do you
[1:53:22] know that it's God he comes in you and
[1:53:25] he manifests himself through you amen
[1:53:28] and all of a sudden your thoughts are
[1:53:31] lined up with the scripture and the
[1:53:34] Revelation that's coming out of the
[1:53:36] scripture is identifying you that you
[1:53:38] are actually who God says you
[1:53:41] are you're not seeing yourself as Esau
[1:53:45] you're able to see the Esau's around
[1:53:48] you because of the spirit of discernment
[1:53:50] that's on you because it's Christ in
[1:53:53] you but you've come into your rightful
[1:53:57] position and this is the hour where she
[1:54:00] comes into the fullness of that position
[1:54:03] Hallelujah so if there's
[1:54:05] Revival it's only in the
[1:54:09] bride glory to God we're going to stop
[1:54:12] right there but remember I'll leave you
[1:54:14] with this one
[1:54:16] thought the Seven Seals and the opening
[1:54:18] of that seven seal when it took place
[1:54:20] seven Thunders uttered their voice
[1:54:22] voices amen but when those seven
[1:54:24] Thunders uttered their
[1:54:26] voices it went out and it's going to
[1:54:30] also produce
[1:54:32] twins we'll continue this next
[1:54:35] week amen praise God let us pray
[1:54:40] father Lord I know that uh it was a bit
[1:54:44] of a struggle Lord to
[1:54:46] release and bring out what it is that
[1:54:49] you've placed in my heart father but I
[1:54:51] just pray oh God that you you have uh
[1:54:54] quickened even one phrase or one word to
[1:54:58] the hearts of your children Lord that

[1:55:03] everything father and so I pray that you
[1:55:06] will allow us
[1:55:08] to mul these thoughts and go back to the
[1:55:12] word and read these experiences go back

[1:55:19] Jacob and Esau and read their whole
[1:55:21] their whole EXP experience all the way
[1:55:23] through and Lord you just uh can so much
[1:55:27] unveil the the the the very thought and
[1:55:30] the purpose that you have in all of
[1:55:32] these quotes and the thoughts and the
[1:55:35] scriptures that we've brought forth here
[1:55:37] today Lord only you can make it real to
[1:55:39] each and every one of us father but we
[1:55:42] one thing we do realize Lord is that
[1:55:46] there's a
[1:55:47] separating there's a faith that's now

[1:55:53] chosen elected Sons and Daughters of God
[1:55:57] that are ordained to receive this word
[1:55:59] and only you can make it real personal
