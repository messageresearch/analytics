[21:28] is why we're here tonight is got to be
[21:32] watched by the waters of the verb to be
[21:35] given the faith and the inspiration that
[21:38] we need in order to impress the
[21:43] challenges it's good to be in the house
[21:46] the Lord tonight is tonight is Wednesday
[21:49] night which is our Bible study head and
[21:52] so tonight we're gonna do some steak all
[21:58] the lines of the ministry over the last
[22:01] month a couple of months about the
[22:04] rapture would be pilot and now a new
[22:08] park for and we've been looking at how
[22:11] important is for us to recognize our
[22:14] position in the Word of God right a soul
[22:17] cycle for the body together in order to
[22:24] take in that praise God god bless your
[22:28] possib side all saints of god welcome
[22:36] mr. Fink and then we're going to be
[22:41] reading from the book of Ephesians and
[22:44] then I'm going to also read from the
[22:51] amplified version the spring for the
[22:54] word father you just want to thank you
[22:56] tonight Lord that we could have this
[22:59] opportunity of joining our faith
[23:02] bringing each and every one of our
[23:04] little fire together at your
[23:07] to bring such a hapless fear of God or
[23:11] we could be under such great expectation
[23:14] and more to receive such a blessing from
[23:18] your word and what that is all we desire
[23:21] father that we could just be so caught
[23:24] up into heavenly places together Lord
[23:26] that we could see each other we could
[23:28] see each other's placing within the Word
[23:32] of God Lord just give us a perfect faith
[23:36] positive to be translated out of this
[23:40] dimension Lord we give you all the
[23:42] praise and all the glory inspiring our
[23:44] speaker inspire heroes or gods be set
[23:48] ourselves together in the Jesus
[23:51] Ephesians chapter 2 verse 21 it says in
[23:55] whom all the building fitly framed
[23:58] together groweth unto an holy temple in
[24:03] the Lord amen he may be seated in the
[24:08] Enterprise version it says in the book
[24:11] the whole structure is joining together
[24:14] and it continues to increase growing
[24:20] into a holy temple in the Lord a
[24:24] sanctuary dedicated set apart and sacred
[24:29] to the presence of the Lord isn't that
[24:33] beautiful
[24:34] next right brotherbrother says here
[24:36] we've got a ministry coming that's just
[24:40] exactly like the life of Christ
[24:42] what does that ministry identify the
[24:46] coming of the Lord amen
[24:49] now look at the age coming now right up
[24:52] to the headstone in the coming of the
[24:55] Lord then may know God in all creation
[24:59] is waiting for the church to
[25:03] find its place amen praise our Lord this
[25:09] is something that's just been stirring
[25:11] so much I must have been stirred in my
[25:14] heart I'm sure it's been stirring at
[25:15] your heart you know that as we draw
[25:18] closer to the final combination of this
[25:21] church being translated you know we
[25:24] don't want to be wasting time you want
[25:26] to know that we're in the service of God
[25:28] we want to know that that we're in our
[25:30] positions we want to you know sometimes
[25:33] we question court what is it that I'm
[25:35] supposed to be doing how is it that I am
[25:38] so important to your body why is it that
[25:41] you called us according to your purpose
[25:44] and that each and every one of our
[25:47] colleagues is very very important to the
[25:50] Lord that we it's not just about Oh God
[25:54] you know just decides to bring together
[25:56] a group of people and you know whoever
[25:58] is going to hear him and is willing to
[26:00] accept what it is that he's singing love
[26:02] will just totally turn turn they'll join
[26:05] in this church because you know it
[26:07] sounds good it's it kind of fits with
[26:10] what you know you know I believe or you
[26:13] know because you've got so many
[26:15] different interpretations of the Word of
[26:17] God out there now so many different
[26:19] denominations so many teachings on the
[26:22] body of Jesus Christ how can you
[26:24] possibly know which one is is the right
[26:27] one unless you yourself personally have
[26:32] come into a revelation of your personal
[26:36] calling in the body of Jesus Christ you
[26:39] will be a wonderer you will be wandering
[26:43] you will be you know you just won't be
[26:46] settled you just will feel completely
[26:48] satisfied but I believe that this is the
[26:51] outer where the bride Christ the church
[26:54] she will know the words
[26:57] the word she will recognize that she is
[27:01] a part of the word and that her part is
[27:04] important even he learned for this final
[27:08] aspect the final pact which is going to
[27:11] be a translation can take place
[27:14] amen break up next so what we're going
[27:19] to be looking at tonight is how it is
[27:22] that you have been shaped for your
[27:26] position you know other people back into
[27:28] the part 2 we looked into you know shape
[27:33] right and how it is that God has
[27:36] personally been working on our lives
[27:39] from the day for before the foundation
[27:42] to the brain and into exactly way needed
[27:46] you to be in order to properly fit into
[27:50] the body of Christ and into the church
[27:52] for this house because there's been a
[27:55] church that started from way back
[27:59] you know the Christianity started but
[28:01] when Christ came down to redeem the
[28:04] church it was then that the church had
[28:07] not even you know seed in the mind of
[28:09] God and now I was going to come into
[28:11] manifestation here on earth known as
[28:14] Christians known as the church that God
[28:17] was going to fulfill the New Testament
[28:20] Scriptures through amen
[28:23] and so this church has been coming down
[28:25] and there's been
[28:26] vigils all the way down you know they
[28:29] look at the pyramid we look at all the
[28:31] different ages and we know that there
[28:33] were individuals that were called under
[28:36] each and every one of those agencies and
[28:38] they all recognized the word for their
[28:42] day and wasn't allowed to do like Luther
[28:45] you know who threw us in the Catholic
[28:47] Church but when the revelation came to
[28:50] Luther that the just shall live by faith
[28:53] revelation of Revelation what they do
[29:03] we'll watch he was in the Catholic
[29:06] Church he talked to Revelation and what
[29:10] they do he left any marks every
[29:20] individual the Word of God is gonna
[29:25] cause them to be changed to be moved for
[29:31] whatever situation two three times a
[29:42] year right maybe no not at all you might
[29:46] miss a few years but the word comes to
[29:49] you in its season it comes to you to you
[29:54] you the son of God
[30:04] [Music]
[30:09] because God was preparing you all the
[30:13] way that's life and so the scripture
[30:18] says here in Psalms 139 I will praise
[30:23] thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully
[30:26] made marvelous are thy works and that my
[30:31] soul knoweth right well God was
[30:35] preparing you from before the foundation
[30:38] to the world he saw you he saw me if you
[30:42] both didn't shake too and when he saw
[30:45] that you would have to come into this
[30:47] world and he knew that you would be an
[30:50] attribute that would come to this up to
[30:53] his top of the come to his purpose
[30:56] that would be positionally placed in the
[30:59] body in that certain church age and
[31:02] dispensation he created you just the way
[31:05] he wanted to be he made you he prepared
[31:09] to he wonderfully made you so here next
[31:12] time so God has been molding and shaping
[31:16] you for ministry since you were born you
[31:25] know your past life you know here on
[31:31] earth and talking about ok because when
[31:34] you're born again it's a brand-new life
[31:36] but when you look back at your old life
[31:39] you start to see certain things certain
[31:42] attitudes certain ways that you were
[31:45] built you know I look back at you know
[31:47] going through grade school I was I was a
[31:50] bit of a troublemaker it's just you know
[31:55] I would always be kind of like you know
[32:00] at the office the principal
[32:04] you know and I thought I was going to
[32:07] Catholic school that was sister Xena she
[32:10] was about four foot tube and about four
[32:13] foot wide but she had a belt and she
[32:17] cared at that belt that she would use
[32:19] that belt and it would be you know like
[32:21] the strap back then used to get the
[32:23] strap and it was like calluses don't you
[32:33] roll her eyes like that you see there
[32:36] was a makeup and so God was using all of
[32:39] that shaping and molding and
[32:42] preparations because at some point in
[32:45] our lives
[32:46] God is gonna possession us and use us in
[32:48] a certain way this one I was always and
[32:53] I still have I love I love I love
[32:57] soldiers I love policemen I love secure
[33:01] it's just you know it's just something
[33:04] about it I love those those action you
[33:08] know heroes right they have super
[33:11] abilities
[33:12] I just just you know I'm fascinated by
[33:16] it and I've always loved and that I've
[33:18] come to realize is because we are super
[33:21] human beings in and just like Superman
[33:26] with the way he flies the strength we're
[33:32] gonna have that same time because we're
[33:35] can return to this earth one day for a
[33:38] thousand-year millennium
[33:43] [Music]
[33:59] [Music]
[34:11] [Music]
[34:19] [Music]
[34:26] [Music]
[34:51] [Music]
[35:02] and so he was preparing you and giving
[35:07] you all that you have got started you
[35:14] just read the scripture and so the next
[35:18] slide what is this verse telling us next
[35:21] it says that I am wonderfully complex
[35:26] and therefore I unique listen every
[35:34] single one of you is unique in the body
[35:37] of Christ
[35:39] you need to realize that and that's
[35:41] important to you to realize that
[35:43] actually sets you free from trying to
[35:47] duplicate or be something that you are
[35:49] not you need to be careful of that
[35:53] because God didn't you didn't didn't
[35:55] purposely call you so that you can call
[35:59] somebody else that's not the way he's
[36:03] built his body every one of us has a
[36:07] body there's only one liver there's
[36:10] certain organs that they operate in a
[36:13] certain way and they do things uniquely
[36:15] and without that you cannot live and so
[36:20] in the same way we're going to be
[36:21] looking here at the scriptures we're
[36:23] going to be seeing on this and God has
[36:26] purposely uniquely designed to achieve
[36:29] you individually for this purpose and
[36:32] for this birth and so I am unique as
[36:35] God's original masterpiece God doesn't
[36:44] make mistakes God knows exactly how you
[36:48] need to be and he wants you to be just
[36:50] happy I lose next he says I was created
[36:56] with meaning for any purpose it's that
[37:04] simple
[37:05] he called us and created us for a
[37:09] purpose and so next God gave me my
[37:12] personal
[37:23] [Music]
[37:29] it's not coming it's not moving are you
[37:32] using we'll just PowerPoint no amazing
[37:34] and you just go back to that just reopen
[37:37] it and just use the PowerPoint that just
[37:40] start from the beginning and bring us
[37:42] right to this slide please and so the
[37:49] first thing we read says that we were
[37:51] wonderfully complex we were unique as
[37:54] God's original masterpiece we were
[37:58] created with meaning for a purpose and
[38:04] God gave me you your personal and
[38:10] when we look at that next slide it says
[38:13] that he gave us spiritual gifts he gave
[38:16] us a heart he gave us abilities he gave
[38:21] us personalities and he gave us eat for
[38:26] experiences just keep yeah so exactly
[38:42] myself exactly yourself will help you
[38:47] review your history and discover how God
[38:49] has prepared you for a unique ministry
[38:53] that only you can fulfill okay so that's
[38:58] why if you want to know all the purpose
[39:01] of this study tonight is for us to just
[39:04] kind of reflect look back exactly your
[39:09] life look back in the way that God has
[39:11] shaped you and prepared you because it's
[39:14] going to give
[39:14] clues as to how who can move more
[39:17] effectively into your position in the
[39:20] body of Christ amen the next slide says
[39:23] all spiritual gifts have a common origin
[39:27] but her handed out what might work by
[39:31] the Spirit of God he decides who gets
[39:34] what and exactly how he was going to
[39:42] mold and shape you so now I'm gonna read
[39:45] from the book of first Corinthians
[39:48] chapter 12 it's not on here okay I'm
[39:52] just gonna read and you're kind of
[39:54] looking and you don't have to be read
[39:55] and I want you to see things I want you
[39:58] to recognize these people we've read the
[40:00] scripture before but now in the context
[40:02] of what we're looking at it says here
[40:05] you know Paul the signal concerning
[40:07] spiritual gifts brethren I would not
[40:08] have you England you know that you were
[40:12] Gentiles every way under these dumb
[40:15] idols even as you were left you know we
[40:18] can look back and it's just so true in a
[40:20] weaver you were moving about doing just
[40:25] of those what a part of getting you to
[40:28] understand that no man speaking by the
[40:31] Spirit of God calling Jesus
[40:34] accursed and that no man can say that
[40:36] jesus is the lord of my Holy Ghost
[40:38] he's naked so clear here that
[40:42] I recognize that you've been filled with
[40:45] the Spirit of God
[40:46] you've been awakened by the Holy Spirit
[40:48] which is Jesus said when the Spirit of
[40:52] God comes he will beat you with a guide
[40:55] you into all truth he's gonna beat you
[40:59] invited you into your position the Holy
[41:03] Spirit is going to guide you into your
[41:05] position because all the same here
[41:07] clearly you cannot recognize or call
[41:10] Jesus Christ Lord without the Holy Ghost
[41:16] there's so many teachers out there
[41:19] recognize Christ in your day the message
[41:22] for your day and so he says now there
[41:25] are diversities of gifts but the same
[41:27] spirit it's not a different spirit that
[41:31] operates in the body of Christ it's the
[41:35] Holy Spirit that opens the body of
[41:37] Christ and there are differences of
[41:39] administration's but the same Lord
[41:45] you see it's all Christ it's all about
[41:48] recognizing that he's in control of his
[41:52] body and all he wants you to do is to
[41:55] come into harmony with his his and there
[42:03] are diversities of operations but that
[42:06] is the same God which worketh all in all
[42:09] but the manifestation of the Spirit is
[42:12] given to every man to profit withal in
[42:15] other words if you've been given a gift
[42:17] it's because God wants you to edify the
[42:21] body of Christ not what you do to build
[42:26] up to encourage to strengthen the body
[42:30] of Jesus Christ regardless
[42:33] the position is the purpose is to
[42:35] strengthen the body to strengthen the
[42:38] planet the purpose of dog right here at
[42:41] good deeper mysteries in Burlington
[42:43] Ontario we need to we need to keep this
[42:46] focused because this is where God has
[42:49] placed you didn't place you in the world
[42:52] out there that can be placed you here
[42:55] this is where it all starts this is very
[42:58] you you start to act and operate in your
[43:02] position and so he says to another to
[43:10] another to another the working of this
[43:25] is all part of the operations of the
[43:38] [Music]
[44:09] [Music]
[44:17] [Music]
[44:25] actually strengthen fortify and build
[44:30] the church strengthen the leadership
[44:33] strengthening my pastor give them
[44:35] authority and and such confidence
[44:40] because of me being in that position and
[44:44] allow myself to be humble to whatever
[44:47] way that God wants me to be humble so
[44:50] that it can fulfill the purpose of God
[44:53] because Saints
[44:54] we're not here to stay here we're not
[44:56] here to get rewards here on earth we're
[44:59] not looking for rewards here I just deal
[45:12] them it makes so much xx a call about
[45:15] this is amazing you know a whole month
[45:18] and get excited sometimes and then
[45:20] realize in an hour he's on my mind
[45:24] together and there's nothing that can
[45:27] override for the rapture because you
[45:38] know you can sit down and you have a
[45:39] lovely meal with a family and a bit of
[45:42] that meal you think wow we're gonna have
[45:48] a supper with the Lord
[45:52] [Music]
[46:04] you see the purpose the priority here
[46:14] from your in this world you've got word
[46:18] don't get you know so spiritually minded
[46:22] they could go earthly good because this
[46:25] is all about balancing but listen don't
[46:28] you need to balance the fact that you're
[46:29] a son or daughter of God because if you
[46:32] are and you are you have authority and
[46:50] so you know as you read this there's so
[46:53] many gifts there's discernment of
[46:55] spirits and you know sometimes you
[46:58] wonder well how does that operating or
[47:02] is it what God has spiritual offices
[47:05] within the church has individuals that
[47:09] have the ability to discern certain
[47:11] spirits they don't realize it because
[47:14] it's a gift it's just that God is a
[47:16] place that they remember the gift is of
[47:18] God but it's not your gift maybe it's
[47:21] God's gift which is the same spirit that
[47:24] operates miracles
[47:29] [Music]
