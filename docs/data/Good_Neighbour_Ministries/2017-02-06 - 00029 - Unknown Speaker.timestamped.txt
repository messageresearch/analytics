[0:00] started 6,000 years ago. That's why.
[0:03] Amen. Time started because of the fall.
[0:07] Because Adam and Eve fell from grace.
[0:10] When God said, "You can eat of all the
[0:12] trees that are in the garden." It wasn't
[0:15] fruit trees. It was people. It was it
[0:19] was individuals. It was it was it was
[0:21] God's creation. But he says of that tree
[0:24] of the knowledge of good and evil. That
[0:26] was Satan. That was the serpent. He says
[0:30] that circuit don't it wasn't a snake
[0:32] that was on the ground. It was an
[0:34] upright being. It's the missing link
[0:36] that science to this day science they
[0:39] call it the missing link theory between
[0:41] ape and man because they got this
[0:45] evolutionary theory that we come from
[0:47] apes. If we came from apes, I'd still be
[0:50] walking like
[0:56] this. Give me a break.
[1:03] evolution. The only evolution is the
[1:05] evolution of you being born again. Amen.
[1:08] By the spirit of God and being
[1:10] transformed in your mind and putting on
[1:12] the mind of Christ and receiving the
[1:14] revelation of God. Amen.
[1:17] But they fell in the garden because the
[1:21] serpent went to Eve and says,
[1:24] "Hey, you should know that if you do
[1:29] this, you're going to be like God." It
[1:30] wasn't eat an apple. It was an adultery.
[1:35] She made love with the serpent in the
[1:39] Garden of Eden. And two children were
[1:41] born. Because right after she made love
[1:44] with the serpent, she went to Adam and
[1:45] she says, "Man, you got to try this.
[1:47] This is amazing. My eyes are
[1:50] open." But that was the that was the
[1:53] unbelief. She went and took another
[1:55] husband and the moment you take another
[1:58] Christian doctrine
[2:00] or
[2:02] creed outside of the pure unadulterated
[2:05] word of God, you are committing adultery
[2:08] against the word of God. And that's why
[2:10] Jesus says, "I never knew you." When a
[2:14] man, that's why you look at the Bible,
[2:15] "And Adam knew his wife, and they
[2:19] brought forth, yes, a child." Christ
[2:22] never knew you. In other words, he never
[2:24] planted his seed, his
[2:26] attribute. I never planted my attribute
[2:29] in you. And therefore, there is no way
[2:32] that you could possibly please me.
[2:36] Genesis 3, the serpent beguiled
[2:40] Eve, told her that her eyes would be
[2:43] open. And look, she goes and and does
[2:45] the same thing with Adam. And right
[2:47] away, the two of them realize that
[2:49] they're naked. Why did they why did they
[2:51] realize that they were naked? And they
[2:52] had to go hide from God. Because their
[2:55] eyes were open while they were there.
[2:57] They were naked. They were clothed in
[2:58] the Holy Ghost. They were clothed in the
[3:01] protection of God's word. They came out
[3:03] from that. And look, two children are
[3:05] born, a Cain and an Abel, and one kills
[3:09] his brother.
[3:11] That's why the Bible says when Jesus was
[3:14] here and he he he rebuked those
[3:16] Pharisees when they they came to him and
[3:17] they says, uh, you know, we are the
[3:19] children of Abraham and we are this and
[3:21] that. He he turned around and says, you
[3:22] are of your father, the devil.
[3:26] He was a liar from the beginning. Who
[3:29] was the first liar in the beginning? The
[3:32] serpent.
[3:35] And that's why that nature was injected
[3:38] into the human realm. And that nature
[3:40] was injected with the wrong soul and the
[3:43] wrong the wrong understanding of God.
[3:46] And it was it it could never be born
[3:48] again. It could never be re uh uh uh uh
[3:52] saved as an attribute of God back into
[3:55] the bride of Jesus Christ ever. It was
[3:59] deceived.
[4:01] And that whole lineage, if you go back
[4:03] through the scriptures, you will see
[4:05] that that lineage runs right from
[4:07] Genesis to Revelation. The two seeds,
[4:10] the serpent seed and God's elected seed.
[4:14] You'll always see it. And God, look at
[4:17] read it in Genesis 3:4. And God hath
[4:20] given me another
[4:22] seed in place of Abel. And it was set.
[4:27] And it goes all the way down. And you
[4:30] will see that God's seed all the way
[4:33] down through and it came through an Ahab
[4:36] who was a prostitute.
[4:38] But yet through that lineage came Jesus
[4:41] Christ because God was showing that it
[4:43] wasn't going to be by works. It wasn't
[4:45] going to be by by because you were
[4:47] better or because you were you you you
[4:49] you made yourself something better or
[4:53] your organization or whatever it is. No,
[4:56] it's not because of that. Because of
[4:58] election. That's right. Amen. Because
[5:00] you were with him before the foundations
[5:02] of the world. And it's not because
[5:04] you're a robot or some kind of a clone
[5:07] either. You've been given free moral
[5:09] agency that when the word of God is
[5:10] revealed and the truth is made known,
[5:13] you can reject it or you can receive it.
[5:15] That's right. Amen. And if you reject it
[5:17] and you, you know, I go to I talk to
[5:19] somebody say, "Have you been baptized in
[5:21] the name of the Lord Jesus
[5:24] Christ?" They said, "I don't know how I
[5:26] was baptized. You need to know
[5:29] because every one of the baptisms in the
[5:31] book of Acts was done in the name of the
[5:33] Lord Jesus Christ. And that gives you
[5:35] just Acts Acts 2:38 gives you the right
[5:38] to receive the Holy Ghost according to
[5:40] the word of God because God is going to
[5:42] honor his word. He's not going to honor
[5:43] the church doctrine or the teaching.
[5:47] When he judges us, he's going to judge
[5:48] us by the word. Amen. There's over 8,000
[5:51] baptisms and every single one of them in
[5:53] the book of Acts is in the name of the
[5:55] Lord Jesus Christ. And somebody says,
[5:57] "Ah, it doesn't matter." Is that right?
[6:00] No. So the word of God doesn't matter.
[6:02] You see, it shows because the Holy
[6:06] Spirit,
[6:08] the Bible says, "And the comforter shall
[6:11] come, and he who is the Holy Ghost shall
[6:14] come in you, and he shall guide you into
[6:17] all truth.
[6:20] The moment somebody comes to you and
[6:22] filled with the Holy Ghost says, but the
[6:25] word says this, I'm not saying it. The
[6:29] word says it. They turn around saying, I
[6:32] got baptized when I was a child. What
[6:35] are you going to do? You say, well, you
[6:39] can't give somebody revelation. You
[6:42] can't give faith to somebody. God gives
[6:45] faith. Amen. My sheep hear my voice. No
[6:48] other voice will follow. When the word
[6:50] comes and it speaks to that attribute,
[6:52] it has to respond if it's an attribute
[6:55] of God. Because he said, "All that the
[6:57] father have given me, might come,
[7:01] will come.
[7:04] Every son and every daughter of
[7:06] God will come."
[7:13] Next
[7:15] slide. Go to the next
[7:18] one. There's a
[7:21] timeline and we're going to stop in
[7:23] three
[7:24] minutes and we'll we'll pick this up
[7:29] again. If you look at this timeline, you
[7:32] can see that there was God alone in
[7:34] eternity before the creation. Genesis 1,
[7:38] the original
[7:39] creation
[7:41] between the time when
[7:43] God created the original creation. It
[7:47] could have been billions and billions of
[7:49] years that they were in the
[7:52] garden. It's
[7:56] unknown. Doesn't
[7:58] matter. It's irrelevant. The only the
[8:01] only reason that we need to know that is
[8:03] because people come and say, "You say
[8:05] the Bible is only 6,000 years old." I
[8:07] go, "Yeah, the Bible is the written
[8:11] word, but not the word of God. It had no
[8:14] beginning and no end. Yeah. Well, you
[8:17] say there's, you know, how do you
[8:19] explain the dinosaurs? No
[8:21] problem. In the beginning, God created
[8:24] the heavens and the earth.
[8:26] Period. It wasn't until Adam and Eve
[8:29] fell. He says, "The day you eat thereof,
[8:32] you shall surely die." Adam and Eve
[8:34] could have been there for a trillion
[8:36] years because there's no time. Yes. Time
[8:39] was irrelevant. Yes. Things could come,
[8:42] things could be there. They didn't die.
[8:44] They just existed.
[8:47] So time is irrelevant when you are in
[8:49] eternity. Eternity is a circle. It
[8:52] doesn't end. Yes. That's why you put a
[8:55] ring on you, you know, when you get
[8:56] married, it's it's it's it symbolizes
[8:58] forever, right? Eternity is forever. So
[9:02] that that duration of time, those
[9:05] dinosaurs could have been there. Those
[9:06] anything could have been there. There
[9:07] could have been fossils and and there
[9:09] could have been uh uh you know men that
[9:13] were like in the almost in the full like
[9:15] like a serpent. He was almost in the
[9:17] image of God. Actually, he was in a in a
[9:21] human image but he had no attribute soul
[9:26] that came from God. He was created for a
[9:28] purpose because God wanted to be a
[9:31] redeemer. Now, we can't get into all of
[9:33] that, but God wanted to be a redeemer.
[9:36] So in order to be a redeemer from before
[9:38] the foundation of the world and to be a
[9:40] savior, something had to be lost. And
[9:43] redemption means to take back something
[9:45] that was originally yours.
[9:48] Okay, we can't get into all that.
[9:49] There's just way too much. But we're
[9:51] going to end it on this
[9:53] note. Genesis 1:2, present creation.
[9:59] Then there's a 6,000 year cycle all
[10:02] inside from the
[10:06] fall. The fall, right, Adam and Eve
[10:10] going to hide themselves to
[10:14] 2017. And there was a lot that took
[10:16] place in between that. We're going to be
[10:18] looking at that and looking at the
[10:20] 2,000-year dispensations that lead up to
[10:24] our day and what it is that we should be
[10:26] under
[10:27] expectation to see next.
[10:32] That okay,
[10:34] it's okay to have Bible study.
[10:37] Is this this is this making sense?
[10:40] Praise God. All right, come on up,
[10:43] Michelle. Let's do a
[10:45] song and then we're going to let you go
[10:48] home and we will continue
[10:52] this next week.
