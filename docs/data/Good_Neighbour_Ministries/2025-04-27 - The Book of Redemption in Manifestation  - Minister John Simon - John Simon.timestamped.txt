[16:54] Hallelujah. Lord Jesus, we magnify your
[16:58] wonderful name this morning, Lord God,
[17:01] because you have encamped your people.
[17:05] Not only have you encamped them, but you
[17:07] now dwell in them, Lord. And Lord, you
[17:11] said that you've put the enemy under
[17:14] your feet, which means that they're
[17:16] under our feet. And this morning, Lord,
[17:20] we can claim what is rightfully ours,
[17:23] the portion of land, the portion of
[17:25] faith that you have purposed in our
[17:29] lives from before the foundations of the
[17:32] world. And Lord, today we can claim it
[17:34] as sons and daughters of God because
[17:37] we've got a father that has left us an
[17:40] inheritance.
[17:42] Father, we ask your blessing upon the
[17:44] worship, upon every word spoken, every
[17:47] song sung, Lord. every instrument that's
[17:50] strung, Lord. Every drum that's beat
[17:53] this morning, Lord. May it be like when
[17:56] the children of Israel, come into the
[17:58] house of the Lord, and everything was in
[18:01] its proper place. And all of a sudden,
[18:03] the cloud of glory came into the house
[18:06] of the Lord. And it filled every nook
[18:08] and cranny. It filled the hearts of the
[18:11] people. Oh God, it set such an
[18:13] atmosphere that sin could not stay. It
[18:16] had to leave. And Lord, this morning as
[18:19] your word comes forth, Lord, may it send
[18:22] back the enemy right back to where it
[18:25] came from. Lord, we claim every word. We
[18:28] receive every word. We're under
[18:30] expectation to hear the voice of God
[18:33] this morning once again. Lord, you are
[18:35] in the midst of your people. Lord, set
[18:38] liberty in the camp. Let there be a bomb
[18:41] in Gilead this morning, Lord. and may
[18:43] the people leave victorious, oh God, in
[18:46] the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, we we
[18:49] thank you for our our precious former
[18:51] pastor, John Simon, that will minister
[18:54] the word of God this morning. We are so
[18:56] happy this morning, Lord, because we
[18:59] know that your spirit dwelleth in the
[19:01] midst of your people. And Lord, use that
[19:04] vessel in a supernatural way today and
[19:07] do a mighty work in our midst. We pray
[19:09] in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen.
[19:14] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[19:19] It is a great thing to serve the Lord.

[24:40] will answer. When he

[27:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[27:05] Hallelujah. How many can say you've
[27:07] heard your name being spoken?
[27:10] Oh my. In order for you to hear your
[27:13] names being spoken, the book had to be
[27:17] open. Not only open, but open to you.
[27:21] So, somebody shout hallelujah.
[27:24] Praise God. Amen. It's personal. Amen.
[27:28] It's not a big group, but it's personal.
[27:30] Each and everyone has to hear their own
[27:32] name being spoken. God bless. You can be
[27:34] seated for a bit. Sorry to keep you
[27:35] standing,
[27:37] but we just know that um uh we
[27:40] appreciate the Lord. That's all we can
[27:42] say. His presence, if it wasn't for his
[27:44] presence, where would we be? When I was
[27:47] a
[27:47] sinner, you know what? You know how many
[27:50] times his presence came to me when I was
[27:52] a sinner? From when I was about that
[27:54] tall, all of a sudden his presence would
[27:57] be there. What a mighty God we serve.
[27:59] full of grace, full of compassion, full
[28:02] of mercy, overlooking everything else
[28:06] and saying, "That's my seed right
[28:07] there." Amen. Come ahead, brothers. Come
[28:09] ahead. Praise God. Not one shall be
[28:13] lost.
[28:15] Praise the Lord. All right, brother
[28:18] Eugene. Come and bless the offering.
[28:20] It's already blessed because why? It's
[28:22] coming from your heart. Amen.
[28:26] as we bring our tithes and offerings to
[28:28] your house, Father. Lord, Father, use it
[28:30] for your purpose, your honor, your
[28:32] glory, Father, in Jesus Christ name we
[28:34] pray. Amen.
[28:37] A little bit more piano if you can right
[28:40] [Music]
[28:42] here.
[28:44] Well, let's do again
[28:48] just sing a manifesting time.
[28:54] The reason why I'm singing it this
[28:55] morning is because I heard brother
[28:57] Brandon
[28:59] say he said uh we can't put dove
[29:03] feathers and stick dove dove feathers.
[29:06] He said you either have them if you or
[29:08] you don't have them. Right? And if we
[29:10] have them they're going to show. The
[29:12] fruits are going to show. Amen. Let the
[29:15] fruits show themselves. Amen. Then I
[29:17] thought, oh boy, Lord bless my heart.
[29:21] It's not a makeup. See, it's just
[29:23] something that is happening. It's the
[29:25] voice of my beloved.
[29:27] Behold, he quickly comes sweeping over
[29:31] the mountain and over the hills
[29:37] Heat.
[29:39] [Music]
[29:46] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[29:50] [Music]
[30:02] God's
[30:13] [Music]
[30:16] chosen
[30:19] little
[30:23] forest. His heart is mine. Keep your
[30:27] eyes
[30:31] open. See that lovely one. Guess what?
[30:34] He's coming.
[30:38] Oh, it's
[30:44] been a
[30:47] [Music]
[30:54] [Applause]
[30:55] [Music]
[31:03] [Music]
[31:05] long run In a secret place so high till
[31:11] the day break and the shadows fade
[31:16] away in that mountain place a sweet
[31:21] smells coming true but he's that lovely
[31:24] one is
[31:32] coming the fruit of the vine I
[31:37] [Music]
[31:39] [Applause]
[31:42] love God's
[31:45] [Music]
[31:51] chosen voice of
[31:54] my voice of God.
[31:58] Behold, he
[32:00] quickly sweeping over the
[32:05] [Music]
[32:05] [Applause]
[32:06] mountain. I hear his voice. I hear
[32:13] his
[32:14] arise. My fear won't come away.
[32:20] It is manifesting
[32:22] [Music]
[32:23] [Applause]
[32:24] time and a love
[32:27] [Music]
[32:38] we lovely one. He's coming
[32:42] [Music]
[32:47] in. God bless you. God bless all of you.
[32:51] God bless you. Real good. Thank you very
[32:54] much. God bless you all. Please be
[32:57] seated. It's good to be here uh by God's
[33:02] grace. Amen. Good to be alive on such a
[33:05] bright sunny day uh of the year and to
[33:09] share with you the goodness of God. May
[33:13] God bless us all together.
[33:16] uh a lot of the things that I speak on
[33:19] I've spoken on it uh already maybe in a
[33:23] different way and then God gives you a
[33:26] further revelation and so you come and
[33:30] you expand on what you might have
[33:32] already said but it's all to God's
[33:35] glory. It's good to see familiar faces,
[33:39] new faces,
[33:41] uh believers growing in the grace of
[33:43] God. And that's the main thing because
[33:47] we are not here to build an
[33:49] organization, but we are here to build
[33:52] and strengthen the body of Christ.
[33:55] Is that right? In that way, because we
[33:59] are not an
[34:00] organization and Satan's whole kingdom
[34:03] is built on structure.
[34:05] It's built on
[34:07] logic. It's built on organized
[34:11] everything structured properly organized
[34:14] so that it's trackable and
[34:17] traceable. But the sons of God according
[34:19] to John 3 are led by the spirit of God.
[34:24] And the wind blows where it wants to
[34:27] blow and no man knows where it's going.
[34:33] Satan loves to have a preacher that will
[34:36] come up and has perfect structure and
[34:40] wonderful, you know, setups and stuff
[34:44] like that. Uh, and I'm not talking about
[34:47] um uh like um having what you call it
[34:52] displays and stuff like that. That's
[34:56] part of the whole thing. But I'm talking
[34:58] about coming with the uh message all so
[35:03] structured. Uh you don't realize what a
[35:06] blessing you have here to have men of
[35:10] God who just pick up the scripture
[35:13] um after studying in the word of God and
[35:16] then allow the Holy Spirit to use them.
[35:19] Amen.
[35:21] But um what you see on the television
[35:24] and what you see online, it's people
[35:27] that many times they have teams behind
[35:31] them that actually prepare that
[35:34] sermon and um they are just the
[35:38] spokesman or the voice for th this whole
[35:41] team behind them.
[35:43] But here you're having one man or men in
[35:47] contact with God and then they'll bring
[35:49] the word of God to you and then it
[35:52] appears so simple that um you may miss
[35:58] what God is really trying to accomplish.
[36:00] Amen. Praise the Lord. Uh I want to
[36:03] thank um the leadership of the church. I
[36:06] just noticed the uh marble um plaque in
[36:12] the front of the church there last week
[36:15] or so when I was here for the first
[36:18] time. It was in the office, but I
[36:20] noticed it's put up there now and I want
[36:22] to thank you all for that. I appreciate
[36:25] your love and your respects and your
[36:28] regard. Amen. uh that is just for the
[36:32] physical person whom you see. But even
[36:36] the apostles, even the patriarchs, every
[36:39] time something was accomplished by the
[36:42] grace of God, Bible says they built an
[36:44] altar. Uh they built it with stones,
[36:47] they put it there. Well, we don't do
[36:50] that today, but we express that in
[36:52] another way. And what you did there was
[36:55] not just for me, but you are expressing
[36:59] to God how how thankful you are for what
[37:04] he has accomplished
[37:06] through me for his glory and for his
[37:10] honor. Praise the Lord. So I'm glad that
[37:13] he allowed me to be a part of it and
[37:15] it's still happening. I said it's still
[37:18] going on
[37:19] and you are a part of it. Amen. You're
[37:22] the ones God is working with us right
[37:25] now and there's another wave coming in
[37:28] and you are a part of it. Praise the
[37:31] Lord. God bless you. I'm going to
[37:33] continue talking with you like that.
[37:35] Really? Praise the Lord. I I'd like to
[37:39] um could we have our scripture there,
[37:43] brother? Revelation chapter 10 vers 1
[37:48] um to 4.
[37:53] Revelation 10 verses
[37:57] 1-4 very
[38:09] familiar. Gracious heavenly father, we
[38:12] thank you for the reading of the word.
[38:14] We thank you for your people that are
[38:16] gathered here today. And we pray that
[38:19] the Holy Spirit will come among us and
[38:22] upon us and upon the word and bless us
[38:25] all together as we fellowship together
[38:28] bringing glory to your name in Jesus
[38:31] name. Amen.
[38:35] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[38:40] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[38:45] rainbow upon his head.
[38:48] and his face was as it were the sun, and
[38:53] his feet as pillars of fire. And he had
[38:59] in his hand a little book open, and he
[39:04] set his right foot upon the sea, and his
[39:08] left foot on the
[39:10] earth, and cried with a loud voice, as
[39:14] when a lion roared. And when he had
[39:17] cried, seven thunders uttered their
[39:21] voices. And when the seven thunders had
[39:24] uttered their voices, I was about to
[39:28] write. And I heard a voice from heaven
[39:31] saying unto me, Seal up those things
[39:35] which the seven thunders uttered, and
[39:38] write them not. That will be my emphasis
[39:44] today. Write them not. Praise the Lord.
[39:48] God bless you. Please be
[39:54] seated. Satan wants to get your
[39:56] attention in every way. While I'm
[39:59] talking, he'll try to get your attention
[40:01] away from what I'm saying. Um, he can
[40:04] suddenly make my suit go square
[40:08] or no. Um, it's it's funny thing. It
[40:12] looks natural and normal, but it's the
[40:14] devil working his works. He can make
[40:18] your attention get attracted by um maybe
[40:22] he has two left shoe on this
[40:25] morning. Sounds funny, but the devil
[40:28] does things like that. But you see, keep
[40:31] your attention on the word of God and
[40:33] don't be distracted. Praise the Lord.
[40:36] I'm so thankful to God. you know um if
[40:40] you will notice in the uh book of
[40:43] Genesis there is a garden called the
[40:46] garden of Eden and you go back in the
[40:49] book of revelation and if you take the
[40:51] two books side by side you'll find there
[40:54] are a lot of parallels you'll find there
[40:57] are a lot of parallels a river a river a
[41:00] garden a garden a tree a a back a tree
[41:05] and so on you'll see a lot of things of
[41:08] that
[41:09] nature. Well, you know that uh quoting,
[41:14] let me quote brother Brandham
[41:16] expectations. A little tree when it's
[41:19] planted on in the earth, a little apple
[41:22] tree about that big is stuck right out
[41:26] in the ground. Do you know every apple
[41:30] that will
[41:32] ever be on that tree or come from that
[41:37] tree, every single
[41:40] blossom, every
[41:43] leaf and every limb that that will ever
[41:49] be on that
[41:51] tree is in that tree right now.
[41:56] Amen. Is that right? Praise God.
[42:00] Hallelujah. Another place he said, "Do
[42:02] you know all the oak trees that you will
[42:05] ever see came from that first one that
[42:09] God plant in the garden and all of them
[42:12] were in that one tree in se in seed
[42:16] form?" What do you What do you think he
[42:18] was talking about? Just
[42:21] trees? No, we we we have understanding.
[42:23] We know he wasn't just talking about
[42:25] trees. It sounded that way. And he says
[42:28] they were all in the original oak tree.
[42:32] Oh my, what a mystery that is. Think of
[42:37] think about it. And so being in that
[42:40] tree, all every blossom, everything is
[42:44] already in that tree. Well, let's take
[42:46] that thought now and move a little
[42:49] further. Harry says, "Now we start with
[42:55] this
[42:56] fact that there were two trees in the
[43:01] midst of the
[43:03] garden. The tree of life was in that
[43:07] garden. The tree of life, he says, was a
[43:11] person."
[43:13] The tree of life, he says, that tree of
[43:17] life was Jesus Christ. Amen.
[43:22] Amen. We know the other tree was
[43:24] definitely Satan, right? Who came? Then
[43:28] the fruit that come forth from that
[43:30] tree, of course, we know it was Satan.
[43:34] Amen. Now that Jesus Christ was that
[43:38] tree, we know he was the prophet tree.
[43:42] He was his own prophet, right? Not but
[43:46] not only the prophet tree, he was the
[43:49] example
[43:52] tree. He was also the bridegroom tree.
[43:57] And the prophets shout, "Glory to God."
[44:00] He was the bridegroom tree. Amen. Praise
[44:04] God. He is the He repeats. He is the
[44:07] bridegroom tree. Amen. Right from that
[44:11] garden of Eden. Amen. Then the
[44:14] bridegroom tree has to have a female
[44:18] tree with it in it. Amen. Or it don't
[44:23] bear no fruit. That's right. How can it
[44:26] bear fruit unless it has a female tree?
[44:30] Amen. He's got to have a bride tree for
[44:33] that. Praise the Lord. Aren't you happy
[44:36] for that?
[44:38] Oh my. Yes. See, there were they're born
[44:41] of the same material.
[44:43] The word made flesh in a tree. It's the
[44:48] same life. I hope you get it. It's the
[44:51] same life in this female tree. Uh that's
[44:56] in the bridegroom tree. It's all in the
[45:00] bride. Amen. For he was the bridegroom.
[45:04] Praise the Lord. I'm so thankful to God
[45:07] for that. Hallelujah. Amen. Now we know
[45:11] that this tree of life in the garden,
[45:14] let me repeat, was Jesus Christ is Jesus
[45:17] Christ. And he is the book of life. You
[45:21] know he's the book of life. He is the
[45:24] book of redemption.
[45:26] He is the book of redemption. Praise
[45:28] God. Hallelujah. So and this book of
[45:32] redemption or this tree of life had its
[45:36] wife in him. Amen. Pro your pastor
[45:40] preached on that just a few weeks ago.
[45:43] How Adam came, their name was Adam. I
[45:46] think it's Genesis uh four or five when
[45:49] it says and their name was Adam. Their
[45:52] name was Adam. Sorry, Genesis 2. I
[45:56] believe their name was Adam. When there
[46:00] was separation, he called her Eve, but
[46:03] their name was Adam. Right? So it's the
[46:07] same way you see one tree of life but
[46:09] there was the female tree in there. She
[46:13] was a part of that and whatever he was
[46:16] she is. Amen. So if he was the book of
[46:23] is the book of redemption. If he is that
[46:26] book of life and she is a part of him
[46:29] then she is a part of that book of
[46:32] redemption. Amen. Praise God. Thank God
[46:36] this is not a regular book now. We're
[46:39] not talking about a book like this.
[46:41] Amen. Because this that's not a book of
[46:44] time. That's a book of eternity.
[46:48] That that that's not a book that you can
[46:49] tear the pages and burn them because you
[46:52] don't like what you're reading. H you
[46:54] can't do that because this is an eternal
[46:56] book. Thanks be to God. Hallelujah.
[47:00] Amen. Now we know that when you write a
[47:03] book the book has to be written with
[47:06] characters in it. You know writing is
[47:09] actually ABCD F. There are characters
[47:12] for people to recognize right
[47:14] characters. So characters are really in
[47:17] the
[47:18] book. The book is really written by
[47:22] characters. Thanks be to God.
[47:25] Hallelujah. Amen. And so that's the
[47:29] reason why the book couldn't John
[47:32] couldn't write that part of the book. He
[47:33] couldn't write it. He's allowed to write
[47:37] about all the the all those uh first
[47:40] bunch of seals, but the last one he
[47:43] couldn't really write anything.
[47:47] There's nothing could be written about
[47:48] that whatsoever. That's we're coming now
[47:52] to the unwritten word.
[47:56] See, it could not be
[47:58] understood. It was like a mystery
[48:00] through the ages. Revelation 10 that we
[48:05] read, we see the mighty angel coming
[48:08] down. You know that that comes from
[48:10] Revelation 5 where the book was closed.
[48:16] It was sealed with seven seals
[48:19] and one sat on the throne and there came
[48:22] a bloody lamb. and he was able to take
[48:26] the book. Revelation 10, all of a sudden
[48:29] the lamb changes to a mighty angel
[48:33] with a covenant around his head. Prophet
[48:36] said that covenant angel was Christ
[48:39] himself. Amen. Christ had come down
[48:43] what? To open up the book. Of course,
[48:47] brother Brandham did not reveal the
[48:49] seals. Brother Brandham did not open the
[48:51] seals. Amen. He just came to be the
[48:55] voice.
[48:57] The mighty angel broke the seals. The
[49:00] mighty angels opened the book. And came
[49:04] down with the book open. Yes, sir. But
[49:07] the book was open yet not revealed.
[49:12] A lot of people say, "Oh, I read the
[49:14] seals and brother Brandham, I study the
[49:16] seal." Yeah. Uh yeah, the seals. You
[49:19] have the book and everything else, but
[49:21] is it revealed to you?
[49:23] Right? It may be open, but is it
[49:25] revealed to you? Right? And if it's
[49:28] revealed to you, the prophet said in
[49:30] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[49:32] He said if you say it's revealed to you,
[49:35] then your life has got to manifest or
[49:39] revealed. Hallelujah. What was in there?
[49:42] Praise God. Other than that, you don't
[49:44] know what you're talking about. You
[49:47] don't know what you're talking about.
[49:48] Praise the Lord. All you got is words,
[49:51] but you don't have a revelation. Amen.
[49:54] Now, first we see this book in the form
[49:59] of the unwritten word in the thoughts of
[50:03] God, in the mind of God until it became
[50:08] spoken
[50:10] word, the spoken word of God. And then
[50:13] God allowed it to be written. you
[50:16] allowed it to be written or somebody to
[50:19] make a because you know a book is also a
[50:22] record right it's also a record so uh
[50:26] they were allowed to write it use
[50:29] characters of English Spanish or Greek
[50:32] or whatever but they used that character
[50:35] that people can recognize what was being
[50:40] said right so it came forth in the form
[50:44] of the written word of God in the form
[50:47] of these characters on a page. But I
[50:50] want you to know that in this season
[50:52] that we are living in, the word of God
[50:56] has come again.
[50:59] And it has come now not just in the
[51:03] writing form.
[51:05] It has come in the form of characters.
[51:09] Living people, characters.
[51:12] Hallelujah. You understand me now? Now
[51:15] you come here in the form the word of
[51:18] God has come now in this time this age
[51:23] not in the form of writing on a page
[51:26] it's moved away from that
[51:29] you we still read this we still take it
[51:32] into receive faith but you better get it
[51:34] inside of you amen and when it goes
[51:37] inside of you therefore it moves from
[51:40] being written word to living word
[51:43] because now the word is living in you.
[51:46] He lives in me. Praise God. He lives in
[51:49] me if I believe him. Praise God. And
[51:52] then the word uh comes and it manifests
[51:56] as a character.
[51:59] Hallelujah.
[52:01] Now, we know this Bible is made up a
[52:03] whole lot of characters. I'm not talking
[52:05] about just the prophets and the
[52:06] patriarchs and the apostles, but the
[52:08] writing itself is characters,
[52:11] right? Praise God. And it's the
[52:14] characters make it a written book.
[52:17] Praise God. Hallelujah. So here we are
[52:20] that we are become what? The unwritten
[52:23] word. That part could not be written. It
[52:26] couldn't be written because it had to be
[52:28] lived. It had to be in people that were
[52:32] prepared before the foundations of the
[52:35] world to receive the word of God.
[52:37] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. And so now,
[52:42] what are we seeing here? Oh, uh, Jesus
[52:45] was the tree of
[52:46] life. Jesus was the book of
[52:49] redemption. But now, what are we seeing?
[52:53] We're looking at the manifestation of
[52:56] that book in the form of people walking
[53:00] upon the face of the earth. Amen.
[53:03] Predestinated people. Praise God. living
[53:07] itself through the character of people
[53:11] that are walking on the earth here
[53:13] today. Do you believe that?
[53:16] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. That book of
[53:20] redemption in now is is in now is in
[53:23] manifestation.
[53:24] It is now in manifestation. Praise the
[53:27] Lord. Hallelujah. Praise God. Now, we
[53:32] thank God that he is writing. He's
[53:35] writing his own book, not by using a pen
[53:38] and
[53:40] paper. Hallelujah. But by God using the
[53:44] seed that he's placed in you or the
[53:48] character of Christ that he placed in
[53:50] you. Now if I use the word the seed, if
[53:53] I use the word the character of Christ,
[53:56] if I use the word of germ, if I use, you
[54:00] know, attribute, it's the same thing I'm
[54:03] talking about. Don't be confused and I
[54:06] don't want to sound mysterious, but
[54:08] that's what it is, right? So God is
[54:11] using his own attribute.
[54:14] He's using his own germ, his own seed
[54:19] that he placed in there to write another
[54:23] book of Acts
[54:25] because it's his people now in action by
[54:29] the Holy Ghost. Writing another book of
[54:33] Acts, not by paper and pen, but by
[54:37] action. The manifestation of the book of
[54:41] redemption is now taking place by the
[54:44] grace of God. Hallelujah. The
[54:47] manifestation of the book in the lives
[54:50] of the people who would be the living
[54:52] interpretation of the book of redemption
[54:56] because their names are in the
[54:59] book. Think about it, brother, sister.
[55:02] Their names being inside of that book.
[55:06] Praise the Lord. And only those who are
[55:09] in that book can walk this walk and
[55:13] really talk this talk.
[55:16] Only they have to germ in them to be
[55:19] able to live that this part of the world
[55:23] that we are in. We're living in a world
[55:26] of chaos right now. And if you don't
[55:29] have an anchor, the prophet said, if
[55:31] your anchor is not anchored in glory,
[55:35] hallelujah, if your tight post is not in
[55:38] glory, he says you can't hold. You won't
[55:41] be able to hold on. This is too much.
[55:44] It's only the Holy Ghost can keep us.
[55:48] Only he can keep us. Grace, grace of God
[55:51] keeps us. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[55:55] You know sometime just a about a month
[55:58] ago I was reading there and uh read
[56:02] where the prophet said if uh when God
[56:05] said let there be light. He says
[56:08] remember the world had never seen such a
[56:11] thing
[56:12] before. Never. They had never seen such
[56:15] a thing before. Before this revelation
[56:18] coming through the prophet the world
[56:20] never seen nothing like this before.
[56:23] And God back then said, "Let there be
[56:25] light." And all of a sudden, something
[56:28] appeared in the sky. He said, "You going
[56:30] to ask what that is? Are you Are you
[56:33] going to ask what it is for the what is
[56:35] it?" He didn't say this, but this is how
[56:37] I I got it. The The manifestation is the
[56:42] revelation.
[56:44] The manifestation is the revelation. So,
[56:46] we come back to the book. The
[56:48] manifestation is the revelation. The
[56:52] manifestation is the revelation. Your
[56:55] life upon this earth is a living
[56:57] testimony to the entire world. Whether
[57:00] they like it or not, your life is a
[57:03] manifestation of this book of
[57:05] redemption.
[57:06] There's nothing they can do about it
[57:09] because it's happening right in front of
[57:11] them. Oh yeah. The devil going to want
[57:14] to play with your mind and say, "How you
[57:15] going to be a part of that? You're not
[57:16] perfect. You're not this. You still
[57:18] doing that. You're still doing this.
[57:19] You're still thinking that now you come
[57:22] right down because a person can be
[57:24] perfect outside but then you have
[57:26] pollution in the dark life. You know
[57:28] those things there. But let me tell you
[57:30] something. When the Bible says that
[57:33] Jesus Christ has washed us and we are
[57:36] perfect,
[57:39] what you have to understand is despite
[57:41] your stumblings, your failings, despite
[57:44] your your thoughts, despite whatever the
[57:47] devil will throw at you, you take God's
[57:51] word who says you're perfect.
[57:54] Not because of what you are doing, but
[57:56] because what he is doing in you.
[58:01] Praise the name of the Lord. Look, you
[58:04] think when uh in the cast out of the
[58:07] devil uh like a policeman uh when you
[58:11] think of it, it's not the man that the
[58:14] devil fears or the criminal fears, but
[58:17] it is the it's the law that's behind
[58:20] that man. It's the power that's behind
[58:23] that man that he fears. Right? And so
[58:27] it's not you and I, but it's the Christ
[58:30] that is within you. The devil can't face
[58:33] him face to face because he's a loser.
[58:36] He's been defeated by the Lord Jesus
[58:38] Christ and he can't stand it anymore.
[58:41] Praise God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Praise
[58:45] God. So, here we see therefore uh the
[58:49] this word of God living in the lives of
[58:51] true believers. We come, we see the uh
[58:56] virtues as you see them up there now
[58:59] come into
[59:01] view. The virtues now come into view
[59:05] because these virtues are you know
[59:08] virtues, attributes, characteristics of
[59:11] Jesus Christ. Is that right? So now you
[59:15] say oh the ah we are the attributes of
[59:18] God. Yeah, because you were sent down
[59:21] here
[59:23] predestinated to manifest one, two,
[59:26] three, or all of those virtues that are
[59:29] up there. Not by your works, but the
[59:33] virtues are not your virtues, but the
[59:36] virtues of Jesus Christ in you. Amen.
[59:42] The prophet said uh as I was reading
[59:44] last night, he says you don't have to go
[59:46] asking a sheep to bear wool.
[59:52] He says because it is a sheep
[59:56] made to be a sheep. It just naturally
[1:00:00] bears wool. and all you have to be is
[1:00:03] yourself and just walk in Christ and you
[1:00:07] naturally will bear these
[1:00:10] virtues. Now bearing these virtues don't
[1:00:13] mean you walk around like a pope or a
[1:00:15] saint,
[1:00:17] you know. No, that's that's not what it
[1:00:20] means. But whenever there is a need for
[1:00:23] a display of that particular virtue or
[1:00:28] virtues because some people in their
[1:00:31] lives they might have one virtue it's
[1:00:34] their preeminent thing right have you
[1:00:38] ever seen somebody like that I've looked
[1:00:39] at some said my that man really has
[1:00:43] patience
[1:00:46] you're not thinking about it but you
[1:00:47] said it you recognize what was what is
[1:00:50] in him. The devil recognizes it too,
[1:00:53] right? That man has really has patience.
[1:00:57] So, one person might only have one of
[1:00:59] those virtues in them, but it doesn't
[1:01:02] matter. He is still he or she is still a
[1:01:05] reflection of Jesus Christ. Amen. Is
[1:01:09] that right?
[1:01:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:12] There is no requirement anywhere in the
[1:01:16] Bible that you all seven of those
[1:01:19] virtues got to be inside of
[1:01:21] you manifesting I mean through you
[1:01:24] because they are in you anyway because
[1:01:26] Jesus Christ is in you but they only
[1:01:29] display when he needs them to display.
[1:01:32] You are put in a situation where you
[1:01:35] need to display patience or you need to
[1:01:37] display temperance or you need to
[1:01:40] display brotherly kindness, right? But
[1:01:43] my God, you know, sometimes the devil
[1:01:45] will even use a brother to say or do
[1:01:47] something that make you want to give him
[1:01:50] a left and a
[1:01:51] right. Praise the Lord. Is that right?
[1:01:55] Nobody wants to say amen to that.
[1:02:03] Right? But praise God, but God reserves
[1:02:07] that. Another person may have just a
[1:02:10] couple of those virtues in
[1:02:12] them. And some will uh have several of
[1:02:17] those virtues in them. Then other people
[1:02:20] will have that quality that whenever any
[1:02:24] of those virtues are needed, it suddenly
[1:02:27] manifests. And then they look back at
[1:02:30] themselves and say, "Well, why did I do
[1:02:32] that? I I should have I should have
[1:02:34] really talked up to that person. I
[1:02:36] should have really tell them this." But
[1:02:37] you didn't because God was displaying
[1:02:40] himself.
[1:02:42] He was displaying himself through you.
[1:02:45] And so that human part prophet said,
[1:02:48] "You need to let go." That let go. Let
[1:02:51] God have his wonderful way. And then you
[1:02:53] stand there and watch God in operation
[1:02:56] making himself
[1:02:58] manifest.
[1:02:59] Hallelujah. So
[1:03:01] God is showing his word and revealing
[1:03:07] the book right in front of them and they
[1:03:09] can't see it. The book is open. They're
[1:03:12] looking at it, but they can't see it
[1:03:14] because they're looking for to
[1:03:17] understand writing on a page rather
[1:03:20] understand God and his people.
[1:03:23] Do you know brother Brandon preached on
[1:03:26] uh God misunderstood?
[1:03:29] Do you know he's being mis misunderstood
[1:03:31] again? But he's being now misunderstood
[1:03:34] in his people because that was the male
[1:03:39] part Jesus Christ the head of the body.
[1:03:43] But now it's the church the bride which
[1:03:47] is the female part of the body. They're
[1:03:50] looking back at the male part of the
[1:03:53] body, not realizing that that same son
[1:03:56] of man is being now revealed again, but
[1:04:01] now in a form of a bride,
[1:04:05] making himself known in the form of a
[1:04:07] bride. And the bride is a part of the
[1:04:11] book because he is the book of
[1:04:14] redemption.
[1:04:16] And thank God our names we believe were
[1:04:21] in that book.
[1:04:24] Now I didn't want to come up here with a
[1:04:27] whole ton of quotations and everything.
[1:04:29] You can search these things yourself
[1:04:30] because you know the Bible said prophet
[1:04:33] says do you know uh the na your name is
[1:04:37] almost like speaking of your
[1:04:40] nature and uh and that's why you have to
[1:04:43] watch the name because that name speak
[1:04:46] of a nature and uh or character. So when
[1:04:51] it says and their names were in that
[1:04:55] book, the seed, the life, the character,
[1:05:00] a portion of the character of Christ was
[1:05:03] a was in that book. Praise God. And uh
[1:05:07] I'm I'm just thinking now while I'm
[1:05:09] talking to you, he brings to my thoughts
[1:05:11] here. He says, "Do you know that you
[1:05:15] were already in your daddy years ago
[1:05:21] since he was a young man? You didn't
[1:05:24] know it, but you were already there.
[1:05:28] Just waiting on the hour when you become
[1:05:31] expressed or manifested." Hallelujah.
[1:05:34] So likewise, our minds are darkened.
[1:05:38] where we really come from. But God is
[1:05:41] revealing to us who we are and where we
[1:05:44] really come from. That we are not just
[1:05:47] of earth. Part of us is amen. But we are
[1:05:50] really from glory and we we are going
[1:05:54] back because we came from there you
[1:05:57] can't go there if you weren't from
[1:05:59] there. John chapter 3 Jesus said no man
[1:06:02] can go back into heaven unless he first
[1:06:05] come down from heaven. Amen. Is that
[1:06:08] right? So for you to say, "I'm going in
[1:06:10] the rapture." It means you were there
[1:06:12] before. You were there before. You're
[1:06:15] only going back to your position in
[1:06:17] Christ. Hallelujah. Amen. My God. That
[1:06:21] perfect stature of a perfect man. God
[1:06:24] struck him on Calvary. Amen. And the
[1:06:28] smitten piece broke off. Amen. Here we
[1:06:31] are upon this earth to make a
[1:06:33] manifestation of the life of Jesus
[1:06:35] Christ.
[1:06:37] Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[1:06:42] Okay. Let's look at some a few uh
[1:06:45] quotations here. He says, "Now, do you
[1:06:47] know that this Bible was manifested in
[1:06:53] the full in its fullness in the person
[1:06:57] of Jesus
[1:06:58] Christ? For he was the
[1:07:01] word revealed.
[1:07:05] I want to repeat that. He was the word
[1:07:08] revealed. That's right. Amen. He was the
[1:07:14] whole complete book of redemption.
[1:07:19] Amen. See, oh my, praise God. That's
[1:07:22] events made clear by prophecy 1965. He
[1:07:26] was the whole book of redemption. Praise
[1:07:28] God. So if he was the Bible, amen, and
[1:07:32] the Bible made manifest in Jesus Christ
[1:07:35] and Jesus Christ is the book of
[1:07:37] redemption, then we realize that
[1:07:40] believers are now living Bibles.
[1:07:44] I said, you are living Bible. You are
[1:07:46] the living word. You are John 1:1. And
[1:07:50] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:07:53] us. Is that right? that back then it was
[1:07:56] speaking of Jesus Christ, but now it
[1:07:58] speaks of you and I. The word made flesh
[1:08:02] again. The prophet said, "Don't you
[1:08:05] understand what's happening?" Amen. The
[1:08:08] the flesh is becoming word and the word
[1:08:10] is becoming flesh. Back to the word.
[1:08:13] Amen.
[1:08:15] Amen. He had a theophony and that
[1:08:18] theophony had to end morphe and you are
[1:08:20] you don't you understand? You are in
[1:08:22] morphia and right back to go back into a
[1:08:24] theophony back in the presence of
[1:08:27] almighty God. You got to go through a
[1:08:29] change and a transformation before you
[1:08:32] go into the presence of almighty God.
[1:08:34] It's going on right now. You say, "I
[1:08:37] don't feel it, but you better believe
[1:08:38] it.
[1:08:40] You don't have to feel anything." You
[1:08:42] just got to believe the word of the
[1:08:44] living God. Forgive me if I don't speak
[1:08:47] very cultured and
[1:08:48] very, you know, um I I get off sometimes
[1:08:52] and get very emotional and some people
[1:08:55] don't like really emotional uh
[1:08:57] preaching. They like really cultured,
[1:09:00] structured, right to the point. Say what
[1:09:03] you have to say and get on with it, you
[1:09:05] know.
[1:09:09] Amen. Now
[1:09:11] notice in a in a message called power of
[1:09:14] the devil, he says notice God said that
[1:09:20] this book of redemption book of
[1:09:24] redemption remember the book of that's
[1:09:28] to be
[1:09:30] redeemed. Amen. What's in that book is
[1:09:34] was to be redeemed.
[1:09:36] Hallelujah. He said what is redeemed?
[1:09:40] Redeem, of course, means to be brought
[1:09:43] back to your rightful position.
[1:09:47] Hallelujah. That's what I was talking
[1:09:49] about. You had to be there first. And
[1:09:53] God allowed you to come down here to
[1:09:56] play a part in the book. And now God is
[1:10:01] ready to redeem you and place you back
[1:10:04] into your position.
[1:10:07] Hallelujah. Oh yes, redeem mean that
[1:10:11] thing is here but it is out of its
[1:10:14] natural
[1:10:16] place, its real
[1:10:19] place. He has to redeem it and bring it
[1:10:23] bring it back to its real place. Amen.
[1:10:27] Hallelujah. Oh, praise God forever more.
[1:10:31] I'm so glad that the blood has redeemed
[1:10:33] me. Amen. Back. Redemption. brought back
[1:10:38] prophet speaking in the same book. He
[1:10:40] says one time one man was speaking to me
[1:10:43] and he says brother Brandham you know to
[1:10:46] me what redeem means it means like the
[1:10:50] devil put me in a pawn shop and the Lord
[1:10:54] Jesus redeem me. I thought that was
[1:10:58] pretty cute right then the devil put you
[1:11:01] in the pawn shop but Jesus brought you
[1:11:04] out.
[1:11:06] I said Jesus brought you out.
[1:11:08] Hallelujah. He paid the price and
[1:11:11] brought you out of the pawn shop. Amen.
[1:11:14] Paid the debt that that you could not
[1:11:17] pay. He paid your debt. You couldn't pay
[1:11:19] it. Amen. He brought you out by paying
[1:11:22] the price. Amen. Thanks be to God.
[1:11:25] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. I'm glad I'm a
[1:11:28] part of that seven sealed book of
[1:11:31] redemption. Hallelujah. And I'm glad my
[1:11:34] kinsman redeemer Jesus Christ has come
[1:11:37] and taken the book out of the hand of
[1:11:39] the devil. Amen. And redeemed me out of
[1:11:42] the field. The prophet said, you know,
[1:11:44] the field is the world. The field is the
[1:11:47] world and redeemed us out of this entire
[1:11:50] world that's full of weeds and
[1:11:52] everything else in it. Hallelujah.
[1:11:55] Praise God. Now the book of
[1:11:59] redemption what he redeemed all was in
[1:12:02] that
[1:12:04] book not outside of the book but in the
[1:12:08] book and if you have eternal life you
[1:12:12] never did begin and you cannot begin
[1:12:16] because you are sons and daughters of
[1:12:18] God your attributes of his thoughts and
[1:12:21] of his word. Hallelujah. You have no
[1:12:25] ending of
[1:12:27] life for your name is in that book.
[1:12:31] Amen. Hallelujah. You had no beginning
[1:12:34] and you have no ending. He says, "But
[1:12:37] remember, you're still in this human
[1:12:38] body. You're not going to You have
[1:12:41] amnesia. You're not going to remember
[1:12:43] when you were in your daddy way back
[1:12:45] when." How you going to remember that?
[1:12:48] We were in God way back when. But you
[1:12:51] start showing characteristics like your
[1:12:54] daddy. You start showing attributes like
[1:12:56] your daddy. You your reactions start
[1:12:59] being like your daddy. Uh the way you
[1:13:01] move, the way you talk, the way you act
[1:13:03] in certain situations, it shows you are
[1:13:06] of a certain family. Amen. Certain
[1:13:09] family born with long artistic fingers.
[1:13:12] You just look at them and say, "Oh,
[1:13:13] that's a so and so." another family born
[1:13:16] with a with a a certain shaped nose or a
[1:13:19] certain shaped face. And you recognize
[1:13:22] they're a part of such and such family.
[1:13:24] We have come with a character of Christ
[1:13:26] in us.
[1:13:28] Not by the will of man, but by the will
[1:13:31] of God. You didn't choose what you are.
[1:13:33] Prophet said, "You think you just walked
[1:13:35] in here like that? You made a decision
[1:13:38] for Christ." What are you talking about?
[1:13:40] You made a decision for Christ. When God
[1:13:43] himself, he said, "You didn't choose me.
[1:13:45] I chose you.
[1:13:48] I ordained you." And when I'm ready, I
[1:13:50] called you. Other than that, how you
[1:13:53] going to come? No man comes to me unless
[1:13:55] the father called him. The deep calls to
[1:13:59] the deep. The spirit of God calls to the
[1:14:02] seed that's in you. The devil may bury
[1:14:05] it in all kinds of dirt for many years.
[1:14:08] He can dump all kinds of accusations,
[1:14:11] lies, sins, wrongdoing. He can dump you
[1:14:14] with drugs and drink and wine and women
[1:14:18] and song. But let me tell you, when the
[1:14:21] spirit of God calls out, it'll reach
[1:14:23] your soul. It'll call out to that seed
[1:14:26] that is in you.
[1:14:29] The deep will call to the deep and the
[1:14:32] deep will respond. They don't have to
[1:14:35] know English. Oh, you think it's
[1:14:37] language or it's eloquence? No, no, no,
[1:14:40] no, no. But there there is something
[1:14:42] coming out of that man, that woman or
[1:14:46] that book or that tractor, whatever,
[1:14:49] something is going to pull you.
[1:14:51] Something is going to pull you. Amen.
[1:14:54] Hallelujah. And I know when the first
[1:14:57] time I received one one book from this
[1:15:02] prophet of God of this century, the
[1:15:05] moment I started reading it, I felt
[1:15:08] something pull upon my soul.
[1:15:13] At that time I was at the height of
[1:15:15] Pentecost. Amen. Oh my. The signs and
[1:15:19] wonders all of it was happening. Oh this
[1:15:21] that that whatever you talk it was all
[1:15:23] there. Oh, fasting, pray, all there.
[1:15:26] Amen. Praise God. They did not have any
[1:15:29] anything more to offer me. But something
[1:15:33] came along. Amen. Hallelujah. And when I
[1:15:36] read that word of God, hallelujah. I
[1:15:39] recognized this is not just another
[1:15:42] evangelist. This ain't not another
[1:15:44] miracle worker. This here is God himself
[1:15:47] speaking through this man. Hallelujah.
[1:15:51] and I held to God's unchanging hand from
[1:15:54] that day to this day. Brother, sister,
[1:15:57] hallelujah. Praise God. And I'm saying
[1:15:59] it as a testimony. Not that I'm not that
[1:16:02] I'm proud, though I should be. Maybe uh
[1:16:05] August 5th, I'll be 80 years old, kept
[1:16:09] by the hand of God. By the grace of God.
[1:16:12] Let me tell you
[1:16:15] friends, I am part of God's grace to the
[1:16:18] human race. Amen. I am a partaker of
[1:16:21] that. I'm glad about it. Amen. He's the
[1:16:24] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:16:27] I know sometimes we preachers preach and
[1:16:29] the things sounds so religious that
[1:16:31] people there they can't get their heads
[1:16:34] down to it. That is a practical life
[1:16:37] that you have to live. You're not going
[1:16:40] to live different than anybody out
[1:16:42] there. It's only that you are not caught
[1:16:45] up in their cruelty, their corruption,
[1:16:48] their evil. You're not into that because
[1:16:52] your nature and the life that is in you
[1:16:55] has no taste for those
[1:16:57] things. Amen. You have no ending of
[1:17:01] life. Hallelujah. If your name is on the
[1:17:04] book, then the lamb has come to redeem
[1:17:08] it. Amen. Not all that profess and say
[1:17:12] they are Christians. No, not all them
[1:17:15] that try to live good. See? No. And to
[1:17:20] and even to live holy. But to those
[1:17:23] whose names were written on that book,
[1:17:27] them alone, those whose names were on
[1:17:31] that book. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:34] Redemption in the book. Praise God. I
[1:17:37] think I touched on that. The name,
[1:17:38] nature, character. Praise God in the
[1:17:41] book. So that's this book of redemption
[1:17:43] is written by what? Written with what?
[1:17:46] This Bible is written with characters.
[1:17:48] Right? The book of redemption is also
[1:17:50] written with characters. But they are
[1:17:53] looking for written characters. It's not
[1:17:55] written characters, living characters.
[1:17:58] It's it's you and I walking around. Is a
[1:18:00] book of that book of redemption. Where
[1:18:03] do you think the throne is? The throne
[1:18:05] is up in heaven. No. He's seated on your
[1:18:08] heart. In the hearts of the bride is
[1:18:11] where he's ruling from. So where is
[1:18:13] redemption? Where is salvation? Where is
[1:18:15] it? It's when you speak the word. When
[1:18:17] you talk to them. Amen. That's where it
[1:18:20] is coming from. Amen. It's not coming
[1:18:22] from out of just like that. It's in you.
[1:18:25] Praise the Lord. I'm I'm going to move
[1:18:27] on here. Praise the Lord. He says,
[1:18:29] "Don't you
[1:18:31] realize that the a conductor is a
[1:18:35] wire?" Amen. And a man or woman of faith
[1:18:40] is a conductor of the word of God.
[1:18:43] Hallelujah. You're the conductor of the
[1:18:45] electricity. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:18:48] Amen. You see, when you get to that
[1:18:50] stage, the devil got to be careful how
[1:18:52] he's handling you. Because he doesn't
[1:18:55] know if he going to touch 10, 20,000
[1:18:58] volts. He He's got to be careful of how
[1:19:01] he handles you. Praise God. You become a
[1:19:03] hot
[1:19:05] potato. He wants to eat it, but he can't
[1:19:08] because it's too hot to handle. Oh my.
[1:19:10] The devil wants to destroy your life,
[1:19:12] but he can't handle it because you're
[1:19:14] too hot to handle. Jesus Christ has a
[1:19:17] control over your life. Amen. Says that
[1:19:20] man or woman of faith, the conductor of
[1:19:23] the word of God. Amen. By that he can
[1:19:28] even raise the dead. That's if he
[1:19:30] believes it. By that he can cleanse the
[1:19:35] lepers, cast out devils because he has
[1:19:39] now fashioned like a and a prophet as it
[1:19:43] common
[1:19:48] go see that is the battle the devil
[1:19:51] gotten you believing you're just such a
[1:19:53] sinful wicked person that you can't do
[1:19:56] anything you're weak on the other hand
[1:19:59] God is trying to convince you. Yes, you
[1:20:03] come through flesh and you were that
[1:20:05] way, but in reality, you are part of me
[1:20:09] and the authority I have over him. That
[1:20:12] is your authority.
[1:20:15] For God is your father. Is that right?
[1:20:18] God is your father. Hallelujah. And he
[1:20:21] all power belongs to God. And that that
[1:20:25] power belongs to you and is in you right
[1:20:28] now. The devil can't do anything about
[1:20:31] it. Pray. Praise God. See, because now
[1:20:35] he is fashioned like a
[1:20:38] god. He He He or she even looks like
[1:20:42] God. Amen. Sure. What is it? God was man
[1:20:47] and man was God. See? Sure. God in the
[1:20:52] man. This is his This is his
[1:20:56] offsprings. He's talking. He says, "I'm
[1:20:58] talking about his
[1:21:00] offsprings." Amen. He's only trying to
[1:21:03] get a hold of man, trying to get them
[1:21:07] into his hands. Praise God. To be
[1:21:11] conductors. Amen. Not with some
[1:21:14] theology. Theology is
[1:21:17] insulation.
[1:21:18] Hallelujah. He said, "Theology is
[1:21:20] insulation." He said, "What is God going
[1:21:23] to do with that?" See, God can't use
[1:21:28] wood. Wood is
[1:21:31] insulation. What's God going to do with
[1:21:33] rubber, right? I It's not like that.
[1:21:37] Praise God. God's word is the conductor.
[1:21:42] It's the boss.
[1:21:44] [Laughter]
[1:21:46] Oh my. You hear that? I said you're the
[1:21:49] boss. You're the devil's boss. Amen.
[1:21:53] Praise the Lord. But if you don't know
[1:21:56] that you are the boss, he'll push you
[1:21:58] around.
[1:22:01] Uh I can't remember what that that but
[1:22:04] there was a movie I saw years
[1:22:06] ago, Mrs. the winter and she married a
[1:22:10] very wealthy wealthy man brought into
[1:22:14] the house and the servants were pushing
[1:22:17] her around pushing her around because
[1:22:19] she used to a simple life not realizing
[1:22:22] that she is until one day when it struck
[1:22:25] her but wait a minute I am Mrs. winter.
[1:22:29] I am the
[1:22:31] boss. Oh my goodness. They're telling me
[1:22:34] it's not appropriate to wear this. It's
[1:22:36] not appropriate to do this. It's not do
[1:22:39] that. Do this. They're pushing me
[1:22:40] around. I am the person here. And then
[1:22:43] it struck her one day and she had to
[1:22:45] say, "Wait a minute. I am Mrs. Winter.
[1:22:48] Amen." And then she went out and said,
[1:22:50] "No, I want this done, this done, this
[1:22:52] done, that done now." and and they're
[1:22:55] taken back now because now she's taking
[1:22:57] charge. That's when the devil start to
[1:22:59] realize that you recognize who you are,
[1:23:03] what you were raised up for.
[1:23:05] Amen. And your original life is now
[1:23:08] manifesting through you. Oh, praise God.
[1:23:11] Walked in here. What were you saying?
[1:23:13] It's manifesting time. The fruits are on
[1:23:16] the vine. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:23:19] Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. Certainly
[1:23:23] take it brother sister. Notice carefully
[1:23:27] you are the word of God is a conductor
[1:23:30] and the Holy Spirit always follows that
[1:23:33] word. Wherever that word is preached.
[1:23:36] See when your pastor is preaching it the
[1:23:39] first thing you know all of a sudden and
[1:23:41] the prophet
[1:23:43] went he says the Holy Ghost just goes
[1:23:45] over the whole building. Amen. for of
[1:23:49] course people try to imagine it like
[1:23:51] when brother Brandon was here that all
[1:23:54] of a sudden the Holy Ghost gone over the
[1:23:55] whole but it's the same thing but not in
[1:23:58] that way he he he was called to be the
[1:24:00] messenger of the age right we are just
[1:24:04] little lights uh along the shore trying
[1:24:08] to show some shipwreck for lawn brother
[1:24:12] amen the way to this shoreline amen
[1:24:16] praise God hallelujah So this is all not
[1:24:20] by
[1:24:22] wisdom. Praise God. It is not by
[1:24:26] knowledge but by my spirit sayeth the
[1:24:29] Lord. For by faith are we saved. Praise
[1:24:34] God. Revelation.
[1:24:37] I have to say it that way because you
[1:24:39] see your your mind want to go back to
[1:24:41] the old way. By believing
[1:24:43] we are saved. No. It says by revelation
[1:24:47] because you can't have something to
[1:24:49] believe in unless you got a revelation.
[1:24:54] Then something is revealed to you and
[1:24:56] you believe that right? But you're
[1:24:58] talking about believing before you even
[1:25:00] get a revelation. You're putting the
[1:25:02] cart before the horse,
[1:25:04] right? Oh. Oh my my my. See, you see you
[1:25:11] see you're a copper wire. A copper wire.
[1:25:14] That's a conductor. Aluminum wire isn't
[1:25:17] a conductor. A rubber hose. No, it's an
[1:25:21] insulator. Wood, not that. See, but God
[1:25:25] wants conductors, born again men and
[1:25:28] women who believe the word of God to do
[1:25:30] what? Be conductors of the Holy
[1:25:34] Spirit. So, brothers and sisters, we are
[1:25:38] not here to come here every Sunday just
[1:25:40] to hear a sermon.
[1:25:43] These messages are here to transform our
[1:25:46] lives
[1:25:49] so that we can go out and truly let
[1:25:53] these virtues of Jesus Christ flow
[1:25:56] through us.
[1:25:58] I'm not trying to tell you to work it
[1:26:00] up. The prophet said the sheep doesn't
[1:26:02] have to worry about bearing wool because
[1:26:05] he's a sheep. So, he bears wool. You're
[1:26:08] a Christian. You're a real believer. If
[1:26:10] you are a real believer, you have to
[1:26:12] know that. But you are a real believer
[1:26:14] that has caught a
[1:26:15] revelation. You are going to bear these
[1:26:18] virtues when you need to have these
[1:26:21] virtues. I have been in a sit been in
[1:26:23] situations where some people are saying
[1:26:26] certain things to me that you know that
[1:26:29] I'm almost about to to say
[1:26:33] something. It would have been out of
[1:26:35] line. But just as I'm about something,
[1:26:39] grab a hold of
[1:26:40] me and get you to shut your mouth
[1:26:45] and then when you speak again, you're in
[1:26:47] a different spirit,
[1:26:49] right? You're in a totally different
[1:26:51] spirit. Praise the Lord. That doesn't
[1:26:54] mean a Christian is a Christian is a
[1:26:55] just a chocolate man or woman and that
[1:26:58] that that any heat they
[1:27:00] melt. You can't stand any pressure. No,
[1:27:03] no. It means you stand up for yourself
[1:27:06] but not in self. You let Christ flow
[1:27:09] through you.
[1:27:12] Says you're a man and that's what it
[1:27:14] means. You're supposed to have a man
[1:27:15] spirit. Amen. And you're a woman, you're
[1:27:18] supposed to have a woman spirit. Praise
[1:27:21] God. Woman does or feminine. Being
[1:27:24] feminine, feminist doesn't mean that you
[1:27:28] have to sit back in a corner because
[1:27:30] you're supposed to be clapping roti
[1:27:33] or boiling rice
[1:27:36] or making goulash or something like
[1:27:39] that. That's part of it. But that
[1:27:42] doesn't mean that you're to sit back
[1:27:44] like that. No, you have to go stand by
[1:27:46] your husband.
[1:27:49] We have to stand by the word. Amen. We
[1:27:52] bear the reproach for the word and we
[1:27:55] protect that that uh uh as proverbs I
[1:27:58] think proverbs tells you that
[1:28:01] Ecclesiastes that's woman who's uh is as
[1:28:04] rare as rubies and people talking in the
[1:28:07] way about her husband she'll stand there
[1:28:08] and be able to defend him. Praise God.
[1:28:11] Hallelujah. And we got to defend the
[1:28:13] word. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:28:17] Praise God. Amen. It's about time you
[1:28:20] want to get up and
[1:28:21] stretch. Anybody wants to
[1:28:24] stretch? Praise the
[1:28:26] Lord. Hallelujah. You are the sons of
[1:28:31] God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Now, I I
[1:28:37] just want to share a few more things.
[1:28:38] I'm not going to take long here, but
[1:28:40] listen. He says, "Notice here, when they
[1:28:43] are like that, they move in the spirit."
[1:28:47] See, they move in the spirit for there's
[1:28:50] a church that's on the road now. Yes,
[1:28:55] that church will is on the road now.
[1:28:58] See, and so they will get so wrapped up
[1:29:02] in Christ, wrapped up in the Holy Ghost,
[1:29:05] right? And their thoughts begin to move
[1:29:09] and they refuse the things of the world.
[1:29:11] They just move in the spirit, live in
[1:29:14] the spirit, walk in the spirit. Then the
[1:29:17] love of Christ begins to fill the human
[1:29:20] heart. Amen. Moving in the Holy Ghost
[1:29:24] and that wonderful church, Amen. will go
[1:29:29] forth with the power of deity and deity
[1:29:34] because deity will be revealed in human
[1:29:39] beings.
[1:29:40] Praise God. Amen. What the manifestation
[1:29:45] of the book of
[1:29:46] redemption deity revealing itself in
[1:29:50] human beings.
[1:29:52] Praise God. By the Holy Spirit bringing
[1:29:56] to pass the thought of their mind.
[1:30:02] Praise God. Hallelujah. I'm not going to
[1:30:05] preach on that, but I'm going to touch
[1:30:07] on it because the devil use things like
[1:30:09] that to take people's minds away. They
[1:30:11] they just think that if they focus,
[1:30:14] according to certain psychologist, focus
[1:30:16] on think about something and and and you
[1:30:18] know, bring to pass the thought of your
[1:30:20] mind. It's nothing of that that nothing
[1:30:23] like that whatsoever. The Holy Spirit
[1:30:26] himself have you in a state where you're
[1:30:28] walking and maybe you just thought
[1:30:30] something and the next thing you know
[1:30:32] there is there is it.
[1:30:34] Right? This is not you making something
[1:30:36] up. It's not by human force, human
[1:30:40] psychology, or or the power of human
[1:30:43] thought. It's not by might nor by power,
[1:30:45] but by the spirit of Almighty. Just let
[1:30:48] go. Relax. Be a Christian. Be happy with
[1:30:52] your family. Be happy with your husband.
[1:30:54] Be happy with your wife. Live a blessed
[1:30:57] life. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord
[1:30:59] God. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. I'm
[1:31:03] just touching on a few things here
[1:31:04] quickly. Uh, brother Danny, that's okay.
[1:31:09] Praise the name of the Lord. Now, see,
[1:31:14] um, when he was here recognizing, few
[1:31:18] recognize him to be the anointed word
[1:31:21] for that day. How many recognize you are
[1:31:26] the anointed word for this day? See, oh
[1:31:31] no, I know him. I know her. Ah, Desmond.
[1:31:35] I know him. I I know when he was a boy,
[1:31:38] we used to go to school. We even used to
[1:31:41] steal people's mangoes off of their
[1:31:45] trees. How is he going to be a
[1:31:49] Messiah? I I I know her. She used to do
[1:31:52] this and say that, whatever. My
[1:31:55] goodness. You see, that's the same way
[1:31:57] with the Lord Jesus when Oh, that
[1:31:59] Joseph's son. I know him. We went to
[1:32:01] school
[1:32:02] together. Yeah, we went to school
[1:32:04] together. But that's the man on the
[1:32:06] outside. What about the man inside? The
[1:32:08] man you couldn't see. That's a different
[1:32:10] man all
[1:32:12] together.
[1:32:14] Now remember these things are what are
[1:32:18] they? It's the display now of his
[1:32:22] attributes.
[1:32:23] God's attributes are now going on
[1:32:26] display. Praise the Lord. They're going
[1:32:29] on display. God have them. So just the
[1:32:32] same way other quotes where we say when
[1:32:33] it comes to the end he's going to pull
[1:32:36] he's going to take the whole wraps off
[1:32:39] of the masterpiece. Said an artist
[1:32:41] working on a piece of art for so many
[1:32:44] years and when it's almost done he takes
[1:32:47] the wraps off of it and puts it on
[1:32:49] display. Amen. And so now the real
[1:32:52] believer becomes what? They become God's
[1:32:56] thoughts on display. God's attributes on
[1:32:59] display. The book of redemption is now
[1:33:02] open. Hallelujah.
[1:33:05] Was closed on the throne, opened by the
[1:33:07] mighty angel. And now it's on display.
[1:33:11] Broken, revealed, now being made
[1:33:15] manifest
[1:33:16] in you and in me as we hold to God's
[1:33:20] unchanging hand.
[1:33:22] Hallelujah. the display of his
[1:33:26] attributes taking place. And this is
[1:33:30] only to be revealed in the last day.
[1:33:33] Hallelujah. When the seal is broken,
[1:33:37] broken. Yes. Broken to who? Not to
[1:33:40] Christ, but to the church, the bride.
[1:33:43] Hallelujah. Praise God. When it breaks
[1:33:46] to you when you suddenly wake up, come
[1:33:49] to yourself and recognize whatever that
[1:33:52] is. I can't explain it. He didn't ask
[1:33:55] you to explain it. But something was
[1:33:59] going to tell you, right? Just like it
[1:34:01] used to tell me since I was a child.
[1:34:04] Somehow you I I felt so different. Uh
[1:34:07] these other boys could break a bottle
[1:34:11] and stab somebody or break in those days
[1:34:14] we use slates not computers and they can
[1:34:18] break that and chop somebody on the head
[1:34:21] and they have no compunction, no
[1:34:23] feelings, right? I couldn't do it. Not
[1:34:27] that I didn't have the courage, but I
[1:34:28] couldn't do it. It just would be
[1:34:30] stopped. But you see, God always like
[1:34:33] that keeping his people. Amen. Praise
[1:34:36] the Lord. Look, Brother Brandon went up
[1:34:38] there on the pole about to grab the
[1:34:40] electric wire to to even commit suicide.
[1:34:43] Do you know that that you said, "Oh, I'm
[1:34:47] so
[1:34:48] depressed." Yeah. Yes. But he was
[1:34:50] depressed, too. To the point that he was
[1:34:52] going to commit suicide. And just as
[1:34:54] he's about to do that, he looked on the
[1:34:57] ground and his hands reaching out for
[1:34:59] the wires. The reflection on the ground
[1:35:03] was the hands of Christ on the nailed to
[1:35:06] the
[1:35:07] cross. And he found himself at the
[1:35:09] bottom of that pole drenched with tears
[1:35:13] as a son of God. Hallelujah. Listen
[1:35:16] friends, no matter what you're in, no
[1:35:18] matter what you're going through, God
[1:35:20] can bring you out of it.
[1:35:23] Is that right? The devil might want to
[1:35:25] hold you in this pawn shop, but he can't
[1:35:28] keep you in the pawn shop. Because Jesus
[1:35:31] will bring you out. Amen. He'll bring
[1:35:34] you out of it. Whatever it is, he'll
[1:35:36] bring you right out of it. Blessed be
[1:35:39] the name of the Lord God. Now,
[1:35:42] notice here
[1:35:45] um just one minute here. Hallelujah.
[1:35:50] Yes. He says, now notice the voice of
[1:35:53] the throne. Praise God. The voice of
[1:35:56] them seven stars voices. Revelation
[1:36:01] five, we find out of the throne
[1:36:04] proceeded lightning, thunders, and
[1:36:07] voices. Not one voice, but voices. What
[1:36:11] was it? It was God speaking to the
[1:36:15] church, reflecting himself through the
[1:36:19] seven spirits. Seven spirits. the
[1:36:22] spirits that he gifted to these seven
[1:36:25] messengers. And in other words, God's
[1:36:28] light from the throne was reflecting
[1:36:30] through the seven church
[1:36:33] messengers. And from the messengers, the
[1:36:36] light reflected into the church age.
[1:36:38] Amen. Is that right? And then when the
[1:36:40] light strikes you and you receive it,
[1:36:43] you reflect it out into the world.
[1:36:46] Praise the name of the Lord. So you
[1:36:47] shine in your little corner and I shine
[1:36:49] in mine. Praise God. We become the stars
[1:36:52] of God that were in the morning there in
[1:36:55] the presence of God giving him glory and
[1:36:58] praise. Hallelujah. And we're reflecting
[1:37:00] the same light down here now just like
[1:37:03] we did when we were up there in the
[1:37:06] presence of almighty God. Hallelujah.
[1:37:09] God speaking to his
[1:37:12] church reflecting himself. You see, for
[1:37:16] when the true anointed of God speaks,
[1:37:20] it's the voice of God.
[1:37:22] Hallelujah. Amen. Oh my. You see,
[1:37:27] voices, the voice of the seven church
[1:37:29] ages, the voices speaking with thunder
[1:37:32] and lightning, speaking with noise,
[1:37:35] maybe like this, but with revelation
[1:37:38] also. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh my. Praise
[1:37:42] God. Everybody can't be a
[1:37:46] preacher. Is that right?
[1:37:49] But you got a voice.
[1:37:52] I said you got a voice. Each one of us
[1:37:55] walks with an atmosphere. Do you know
[1:37:57] that? Each one of us walks with an
[1:37:59] atmosphere. We walk with a voice. But
[1:38:03] and you can't preach the people a
[1:38:04] sermon. Amen. If you're called to the to
[1:38:08] the pulpit to preach it. You see, you're
[1:38:11] a preacher. If not, you're still a
[1:38:13] preacher. But by living the people a
[1:38:16] sermon, let your sermons be lived. For
[1:38:20] that is the voice of God that will be
[1:38:23] reproached to them that will reject the
[1:38:26] word of God. Your life, the book is
[1:38:29] right there open for them to read and
[1:38:32] they reject that, then they are in real
[1:38:35] trouble. Live your sermons. Don't try to
[1:38:38] preach them. If you're not called to be
[1:38:40] a preacher, you'll get mixed up anyhow.
[1:38:43] You'll get people tangled up, you see,
[1:38:46] and ruin them, too. See, but the
[1:38:49] preacher is called to preach. But you
[1:38:51] live your sermons. Praise God. Think
[1:38:55] about them voices. We need them voices
[1:38:58] here today. You believe that? Amen. Back
[1:39:01] then he said, "Oh, how we need them
[1:39:04] voices in Jeffersonville here by the
[1:39:07] thousands." Live live voices of God
[1:39:11] thundering out in sweetness and in
[1:39:14] holiness, purity, undefiled lives
[1:39:18] walking around in the earth. Amen.
[1:39:22] Praise God. When he spoke on the statue
[1:39:24] of a perfect man, he says, "What do you
[1:39:26] think I'm talking about? You think I'm
[1:39:28] talking about bells on top of a
[1:39:30] building? No, I'm not talking about
[1:39:33] bells on a building, but the but I'm
[1:39:36] talking about gospel bells of holiness
[1:39:38] and purity. Amen. Men and women called
[1:39:41] to be kings and priests to God. The high
[1:39:44] priest used to have some small bells on
[1:39:46] the bottom of his robe and when he walks
[1:39:48] it would tinkle and tinkle. Amen. See,
[1:39:51] so they know they couldn't go in there.
[1:39:54] But if he went in there and they heard
[1:39:55] the tinkling, they know he's still
[1:39:57] alive. When they hear it go quiet, they
[1:39:59] know he's
[1:40:00] dead. Oh my. So, we are to walk with
[1:40:04] that gospel tinkle about us. There's a
[1:40:07] ring that comes out of a man of God, a
[1:40:10] son of God, a child of God, a daughter
[1:40:12] of the living God, living holy,
[1:40:15] undefiled lives without blemish. real
[1:40:18] Christians. The devil don't care how
[1:40:21] loud you can shout or holler. The devil
[1:40:24] don't care how much you can jump or how
[1:40:27] much you can dance in the spirit or
[1:40:30] shout or do this. But what hurts the
[1:40:33] devil is to see that
[1:40:35] sanctified holy life consecrated to God.
[1:40:40] say anything him, call him anything, and
[1:40:43] he they remain as sweet as they can be
[1:40:46] and move right on. That is the real
[1:40:50] thunder that shakes the devil. He
[1:40:53] doesn't understand
[1:40:55] it. When you're supposed to lash out,
[1:40:58] you just said, you just Amen. as a lamb
[1:41:02] without spot and without blemish. when
[1:41:04] you're supposed to punch
[1:41:06] out, you stand up there meek and mild.
[1:41:10] Praise God. He says, "Now, that that
[1:41:13] sounds funny, but that is a thunder that
[1:41:15] shakes the devil. Praise God.
[1:41:18] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord God." I'm
[1:41:20] going to wind this up right now if you
[1:41:22] don't mind. I don't want to go on any
[1:41:27] further. Praise God. Hallelujah. He goes
[1:41:30] on to say, "You can be able to preach
[1:41:32] better than Oral Roberts. You may be
[1:41:34] able to even speak better than Billy
[1:41:36] Graham, but he said that's not it.
[1:41:39] That's not it whatsoever is to live such
[1:41:42] a life that those virtues are flowing
[1:41:46] through you."
[1:41:48] Hallelujah.
[1:41:50] And it's not flowing through you uh as
[1:41:52] you will, right? In other words, you're
[1:41:55] going to you're going to uh stick
[1:41:58] feathers on a black bird. All right? I'm
[1:42:02] I'm sorry, but sticking dove feathers on
[1:42:05] a black bird doesn't make that bird a
[1:42:09] dove. Right? Or putting a pig in a sheep
[1:42:15] pen doesn't turn him into a lamb. Is
[1:42:18] that right? Uh you so they think by
[1:42:20] going to church they're going to be
[1:42:23] changed into being a lamb. It doesn't
[1:42:26] change you from being a lamb. You see
[1:42:28] it's the nature is the character and
[1:42:30] that character if it's not a part of
[1:42:32] that book right it it can even be right
[1:42:35] in the atmosphere but it won't do
[1:42:37] anything to it. But if it's in the right
[1:42:39] atmosphere and the and the moisture of
[1:42:43] the word of God uh comes upon it'll come
[1:42:47] to life. Is that right? Uh I'm leaving
[1:42:50] out something and I was just reminding
[1:42:51] about it and about coming back to the
[1:42:54] tree that was in the garden and I'll
[1:42:57] touch on it briefly here. Uh to the tree
[1:42:59] of life that's in Revelation chapter
[1:43:02] believe uh chap chapter
[1:43:10] 20. Just one minute.
[1:43:18] just all winding
[1:43:24] down
[1:43:30] Revelation. I have the pages sticking
[1:43:32] together here.
[1:43:35] Yes.
[1:43:40] 22. 22.
[1:43:47] Yes. Okay. Down the middle of the great
[1:43:50] street of the city on each side of the
[1:43:53] river stood the tree of life.
[1:43:57] Hallelujah.
[1:43:59] The stood the tree of life was on the
[1:44:03] banks of that river. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:06] Hallelujah. And where does the river
[1:44:08] flow from? This this this torrent of
[1:44:11] revelation comes right from the throne
[1:44:12] of God and it's flowing right down.
[1:44:16] Hallelujah. Right from the throne. And
[1:44:19] here it is that this tree right stood
[1:44:23] the tree of life. But now this tree is
[1:44:27] bearing 12 crops of
[1:44:31] fruit. 12. Praise God. Oh, praise God.
[1:44:35] Out of it comes the 12 tribes of Israel.
[1:44:37] Is that right? But then look what it
[1:44:40] continues to say. And and uh yielding
[1:44:45] its fruit every month. Amen. How many
[1:44:48] months in a year?
[1:44:51] Oh my. So it's 12 apostles now. And
[1:44:54] those 12 apostles, what happens? They're
[1:44:56] bearing fruits. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:45:00] Fruits every month of the year. Praise
[1:45:03] the Lord. And the leaves are for the
[1:45:06] healing of the nations.
[1:45:08] Praise God. The book of redemption.
[1:45:11] What? Wow. The book of redemption. The
[1:45:14] leaves. Praise God. Go back into Psalms
[1:45:17] where David said, "Let the leaves of the
[1:45:19] trees clap their hands." What's the
[1:45:20] leaves? It's people. Praise God. And
[1:45:22] he's telling, "Let them clap their
[1:45:24] hands. Give praise to God." Lift up your
[1:45:27] hands. Clap your hands all you people.
[1:45:29] Praise the Lord. Raise your voice in the
[1:45:32] voice of triumph. Praise the Lord for
[1:45:35] the healing of the nations. Praise God.
[1:45:38] Jesus said, "You are the salt of the
[1:45:40] earth." How many knows that? I think
[1:45:43] that's Matthew chapter 5. You're the
[1:45:44] salt of the earth. Well, you know what
[1:45:46] salt is? Salt is a
[1:45:50] Wow. You know that salt is a preserver.
[1:45:54] Salt is a healer. You know that salt is
[1:45:56] a healer. It's a preserver. Praise the
[1:45:59] name of the Lord. Uh but you know
[1:46:01] sometimes to do the preservation and the
[1:46:03] healing it
[1:46:05] stings. You know one of the best things
[1:46:07] if you get a cut and you want that
[1:46:10] bleeding to stop
[1:46:12] quick if you can stand this the stinging
[1:46:15] is to put salt. And if you put salt on
[1:46:18] that it'll dry up and become hard and
[1:46:20] crusty very shortly. Amen. So that's
[1:46:24] what salt is. So that's what we are here
[1:46:27] for in the world, right? To be the salt
[1:46:30] and the light, right? And therefore, you
[1:46:34] are a
[1:46:35] preserver. They need us in the
[1:46:37] atmosphere. In the book of Ephesians, it
[1:46:40] tells us that also that
[1:46:44] um this hour of I want to find that if I
[1:46:47] have the scripture
[1:46:49] here because out of the amplified
[1:46:53] version in this time of chaos, it tells
[1:46:56] you how and
[1:46:59] lawlessness the time of chaos and law.
[1:47:03] Look, 2 Thessalonians Amplified Version.
[1:47:06] For the mystery of
[1:47:09] lawlessness, the hidden principles of
[1:47:12] rebellion against all constituted
[1:47:16] authority is now already at work in the
[1:47:21] world. But it is only
[1:47:27] restrained by he who restrains if until
[1:47:32] he be taken out of the way. Is that
[1:47:36] right? Now you know the word restrain
[1:47:39] means hinders.
[1:47:41] Do you know that your presence in the
[1:47:44] world is what's hindering this whole
[1:47:45] thing from completely falling apart?
[1:47:48] Our presence right now in the world is
[1:47:52] what we are a a torn in the sight of the
[1:47:54] devil.
[1:47:56] uh you call him for the rapture, he glad
[1:47:58] for you to go so he can get control of
[1:48:00] the you know bringing his antichrist and
[1:48:03] his superman to take control. He can't
[1:48:07] wait for us to get out of here. Just
[1:48:10] like Pharaoh couldn't wait for Israel to
[1:48:12] go take as much as you want. Is that
[1:48:14] right? You know, the Bible tells you
[1:48:16] that when it comes to the end that um uh
[1:48:22] they're to leave Egypt and when you
[1:48:24] leave, leave with great substance.
[1:48:28] Is that right? A lot of people think
[1:48:30] it's not right for a Christian to be
[1:48:34] rich or for a Christian to have any
[1:48:38] money. If you have any money, you're
[1:48:40] ungodly or you're greedy.
[1:48:44] But now go back and read your Bible
[1:48:48] again. He told them go back to those
[1:48:51] Egyptians
[1:48:54] and borrow. They have borrow. But it's
[1:48:57] not borrow. It's demand. Because they
[1:49:00] work as slaves for all those years. So
[1:49:02] you asking for your pay. You go back and
[1:49:06] you asking for your pay. You deserve
[1:49:08] this. Go back and ask them. And the
[1:49:12] Bible says they were more than glad to
[1:49:13] give them all their jewels and all kinds
[1:49:15] of stuff. And the Bible continues, "And
[1:49:18] Israel came out of Egypt with great
[1:49:22] substance."
[1:49:24] Do you know we are about to leave here
[1:49:26] again?
[1:49:28] And we are supposed to leave now with
[1:49:30] great substance.
[1:49:32] Right? If you didn't see that in the
[1:49:34] word and you don't know that, you
[1:49:36] understand? I I noticed some brothers
[1:49:39] are not I preached those things years
[1:49:40] ago but now some brothers are starting
[1:49:43] to you know when I would tell them
[1:49:46] things like that back then they say oh
[1:49:47] no you know we supposed to be contented
[1:49:53] and well you are supposed to have a
[1:49:56] contented spirit but contented spirit
[1:49:59] does doesn't mean that you shouldn't
[1:50:01] want or need get what you need for
[1:50:05] yourself and for your family and get
[1:50:07] enough so you your cup is full
[1:50:11] and running over.
[1:50:14] Uh I'm not preaching
[1:50:16] on I'm just sharing.
[1:50:20] Your cup should be full
[1:50:23] and running over so that you have extra
[1:50:27] excess to give and help. Amen. help
[1:50:32] missionaries, you know, do this, do
[1:50:34] that, do the where you going to get it
[1:50:36] from? If you're just you can't even help
[1:50:39] yourself, how you going to be able to
[1:50:41] really help others? So, God wants to
[1:50:43] give you more substance.
[1:50:45] God wants to lift you up and bless you.
[1:50:49] And as his children, we deserve it cuz
[1:50:52] the devil kept you in slavery for so
[1:50:55] many years. And it's time that we go out
[1:50:57] of this place. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:51:02] Hallelujah.
[1:51:04] Praise God. I won't give you all those
[1:51:06] other scriptures. Amen. I notice that
[1:51:10] the he told David, he says, "Don't you
[1:51:14] worry. I'll give you the treasures of
[1:51:17] darkness."
[1:51:18] I Hallelujah. Let the sinners heap it
[1:51:21] up. Is that right? They can heap it up
[1:51:24] all they want, but I'm going to let them
[1:51:27] start handing it over to you. Amen. Is
[1:51:30] that right?
[1:51:32] I don't mean you're going to walk up to
[1:51:33] Mr. Buffy
[1:51:36] and said, "I need you to give me 10
[1:51:38] million." No, I'm not talking about
[1:51:41] that. But I mean of their own accord,
[1:51:45] out of their own heart. God is going to
[1:51:48] make them do things of that nature. I
[1:51:50] just want to give you for no reason at
[1:51:53] all. Don't even ask ask for it because
[1:51:55] the hour is now. It's come. Praise the
[1:51:57] Lord. But don't remember when your cup
[1:52:00] gets full, which is what a lot of people
[1:52:02] get themselves in trouble. They start
[1:52:06] grabbing and and holding on and they
[1:52:10] don't want to give up. But he says, "No,
[1:52:12] I'm fulling your cup so it could run
[1:52:14] over." And then you take what is running
[1:52:17] over and you give to others. You help
[1:52:19] other people without favor. Just Just do
[1:52:22] it. Hallelujah. And be a blessing.
[1:52:25] Praise the Lord. Be a blessing. Oh,
[1:52:28] praise God, brother Daniel. I'm going to
[1:52:30] stop. Praise God. Because I don't want
[1:52:33] to talk to these people. There so many
[1:52:35] Christians that curse money on a Sunday
[1:52:37] and go work like the devil for it on a
[1:52:39] Monday. God bless you all. Hallelujah.
[1:53:18] There we go. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:53:22] Amen. How many enjoyed that?
[1:53:25] Glory to God. That's what happens when,
[1:53:28] you know, there's so many years of of
[1:53:31] wisdom and and experience and, you know,
[1:53:35] it just flows out of him. So simple, so
[1:53:37] easy. But let me tell you saints, it's
[1:53:40] God. It's the Lord giving us strength
[1:53:43] through the word. The word just comes
[1:53:45] forth, heals our minds, heals our
[1:53:48] hearts, gets us back into the place
[1:53:50] where we need to be. Amen. Praise God
[1:53:53] forever more. So today, um, we're going
[1:53:57] to be having our general meeting for,
[1:54:00] uh, all the tithe paying members. Um but

[1:56:29] humble. It was God who devised a
[1:56:35] plan that in all things as a
