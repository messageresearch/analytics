TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] don't you need to do everyone's they worried when we see that precious work that's going to strengthen me to receive strength from it it's a supernatural strength don't be looking for evidence this is not something listen baby this something that you see what it's been invested in that's when you see it but before that just faint it's just pulling it from the unseen you're trying to because you believe [Music] [Music] [Music] by the transforming power of the perineal here at chop their job they start to receive everything that we have needed in order to overcome and so when you press through those pipes and you or you you are being super not truly empowered by God to overcome the situations in your life then you wonder why all of a sudden [Music] [Music] service part and this part of coming into the house this is the natural what is God's purpose for this he says for the perfecting of the Saints unto the work of the ministry unto the building of the body of Christ that's the whole purpose so that you can receive he says here when you what okay in first Peter what you have faith okay what God is giving you another faith because remember this is all so you can comfortably unit do you know that once God gives you a revelation there ain't a demon that can take it back so don't ever think that you lose you can't lose revelation because revelation is docking you so it's not something that could ever be taken listen in first Peter 1:23 says these things have I written to you concerning them that seduce you because the devil is going to try to seduce you and try to defeat you and try to weaken you he says ministers and met with false doctrine of the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you this is not about this is about receiving the word we see it's as simple as that if you're hearing what I'm speaking today if you're hearing the the spirit want the Spirit is speaking to you as an individual and you receive it you're being empowered and you're being transformed into the Word of God into actually living it in front of the people it's not something that you can explain he says he says perhaps the same anointing teaches you all things and is truth is the lie and even has it has taught you you shall abide in so you're always in Christ you see it's him that your hope of glory it's heaven you that overcomes him that's duty honor country because you receive it you believe and you accepted it and now because you're letting it there you're speaking that you're manifesting each believer that has a need to be but every one of you has that need you need to be in a position you need to be given the equipment so you should be looking for your position how you're gonna do for the local the Saints are equipped as each one fulfills their responsibility to serve to minister and to build one another up so you're equipped to do all of this here equip that strengthen identify and build up you see if you get the right instruction and you accept the word for your day and what God is trying to do in this is this is so important of a receiving right not because God wants us to come into the unity of faith so he can empower for the body because it's that happy that gives the destruction of the body it's still all these Christ but whatever the joints are locked and they're gonna be controlled by my evil spirits and Allah do not serve through his people brings this to pass its Christ in you it's him we are keeping focus that such work is first and foremost a privilege it is an honor to serve it is an honor to be called disbanded the South conclusion God will always people to serve equipping everyone but how effectiveness depends on how we do this together as blood luck you see why unity so forth see why it's so important to recognize and to see how it is that that when we operate with the spirit of the giving spirit of love the spirit of magnification glory God knows how to correct identified and deal with situations that need to be dealt with God to provide a way of dealing with your circumstances God will give you that you couldn't deal with everything because when you come under subjection of what you're hearing here it all starts at home if your house is not in order you're not at home living and breathing and and manifesting this word that God is giving us as an atom as a as a father as a mother as a young person you're not manifesting it in your daily routine and you're not living it how could it really have effect because remember the program says this is not something you put on this is something you live this is who you are and just who you are they've been oppressing your life and blesses and builds the body of Christ next slide what does God expect from the church until the attaining you can feel debate and the knowledge of the Son of God to a mature man to the measure of the stature which belongs to the fullness of Christ until we come into that community until we come into that one mind and one Accord you see it was waiting and went up into the upper room but there was only 120 then came into one and that's what started this horror that's what started the building up of the body and all through the ages has been those that recognize their day and their message and they were the representatives of God they were God's Word be manifested people and it progressed on and listened they received overcome everything perfect because you're in the right word and the word was sent and not to return talking about the coming of the Lord they've all been talking about the second coming of the Lord you know what the second coming of the Lord is here you know why they listen because he's here now in the word he's the mighty angel let's come down the head put his foot of the seed about the land and said time shall be before and he's coming out into a five fold ministry this is what we've been talking about he's come out and they're missing him because they're looking for a literal coming meanwhile the little comings gonna be what we did here glory to God but they're missing they're now in Word form because he's here because he said by the foolishness of preaching they cometh by hearing and hearing the word and people say now but it's just dandy it's just John cycling it's just Christopher it's just Philip it's just Tim that's what you're looking at but my sheep hear my voice Jesus said what the spirits saying what the spirits are you hearing what God is speaking and how he's calling this church and positionality pleasing that is the coming of the Lord and you will miss it if you're looking like the rest of the world see the difference he's in word for his first coming was when he came to the earth the words made and among them in the name of Jesus Christ and he looked at all of those denominations all of those Pharisees and all those Socrates he was talking to them that they're saying our Father was Abraham you were up your father you were Beelzebub they were calling God devil there's no us what's gonna happen you meet yourself Cobb you think yourself something's develop you know we just recognize what God is doing according to the scripture and if you can show you anything different than what the word says according to God was supposed to take place at this date at this hour then I might believe but I believe the word that's why being baptized as adults because he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved not some baby baptism or even a baptism as an alum into the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost which is how the amount is 90% of them out there you haven't baptized you have not submitted to the Word of God and taking on the name of the trust as your husband and because not your gloss I don't care how sincere on race blood it's not about being sincere in place when the tsunami comes there's gonna be a lot of sincere and nice people but that's not gonna love them up when that earthquake strikes California there's going to be a lot of preaching going on that supporting and they're gonna be preaching on the power of government the blessings of Lord how the gods are provided but when that earthquake comes and the urban opens up it's gonna welcome why because believe the rapture takes you on the side mentioning the body James let the musicians never sold Myrtle yes because a lot of us are perfect we can't help it you're human it's only sure that human vessel you're going to feel a burden of this place you feel the pressures of this life you're gonna feel the circumstances and the elements and the bills are going to be there and the pressures are going to be there the kids are going to be giving their heart time sometimes is just gonna happen Saints you're gonna feel sick sometimes again these are all the things with this world there's all part of overcoming glory of God Saints wink just a lot and on and on the next slide says well the church are we to do the church growth to attain a unity invaded as we embrace the truth the true knowledge of the Son of God the church is called to ensure into the fullness of Christ to do the woodcock bringing him glory and eternal gratitude conclusion God desires the whole body to mature as we grow in living out the fullness of Christ as we do so God's divine glory is revealed god bless you sings I trust that somehow this word is gonna give you strength to go up meat Monday morning [Music] I can meet the challenges that would have faced me this week and there's going to be some it's just the way of five states we've got that we've gotta be mature about who we are and we've got we've gotta be able to stand up and take the blows and move on and press on and know that God is not going to go back to what he says there's nothing sometimes they get whacked and sometimes they just [Music] provide all of our needs [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
