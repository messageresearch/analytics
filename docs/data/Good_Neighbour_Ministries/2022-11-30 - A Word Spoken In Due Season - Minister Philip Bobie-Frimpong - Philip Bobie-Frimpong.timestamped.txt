[33:56] a blessing to be here
[33:58] just
[34:01] I don't know how to express it but
[34:04] it's a holy place here to stand with the
[34:08] grace of God and we will never saw the
[34:10] time you can't come here all the time
[34:12] but we believe that God will take
[34:13] control
[34:15] amen so our confidence is not in me if
[34:18] you came here to listen to bro I feel
[34:21] like that you are in trouble
[34:23] but you have to have in your heart
[34:26] you're coming to hear from the Lord and
[34:28] with that expectation God will speak to
[34:31] your needs amen because I have nothing
[34:34] to give to you but he has
[34:36] so you're lying on him
[34:38] and without wasting my time
[34:41] let's read our scriptures
[34:44] and have two scriptures and
[34:48] my title is um
[34:53] okay so let's read the two scripts I'll
[34:55] give you the title I wrote it back
[34:58] first Peter
[34:59] chapter 1 verse 1 to 7. and Proverbs 15
[35:04] 23.
[35:11] to finally say Amen
[35:22] okay
[35:24] I read from the Bible
[35:27] from the top yeah
[35:30] Simon
[35:31] Peter
[35:33] a servant
[35:37] and an apostle of Jesus Christ
[35:42] Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to The
[35:44] Strangers
[35:47] scattered throughout Pontius galatia
[35:51] Cappadocia Asia and bathania
[35:56] elect according to for knowledge of God
[36:01] the father true sanctification of the
[36:03] spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of
[36:07] the blood of Jesus Christ
[36:10] unto you and peace be multiplied
[36:16] blessed be the God and father of our
[36:19] Lord Jesus Christ which according to His
[36:21] abundant Mercy had begotteness unto a
[36:25] lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[36:28] Christ from the dead restful
[36:31] to an inheritance incorruptible
[36:34] and undefiled and that faded notary
[36:39] reserved in heaven for you he said that
[36:42] an inheritance
[36:44] incorruptible
[36:47] and undefiled
[36:50] and that faded not away think on that
[36:56] reserved in heaven
[36:58] for you
[37:00] amen who kept by the power of God
[37:03] through faith unto salvation
[37:07] ready to be revealed in the last time
[37:11] where we greatly rejoice
[37:14] though now for a season if need be ye
[37:19] are in heaviness true manifold
[37:22] Temptations
[37:24] that's my our best most on here that the
[37:29] trial of your faith
[37:31] being much more precious
[37:35] than of gold
[37:37] that perish though he betrayed with fire
[37:42] might be found unto praise and honor and
[37:45] Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ
[37:48] and I'm gonna base most much of my
[37:52] thoughts on this and Proverbs 15 23.
[37:59] it's just I can't get away from this
[38:01] scripture here that has been my topic a
[38:04] man has Joy by the answer of his mouth
[38:08] and a word spoken in due season how good
[38:12] is it so my targets a word spoken in due
[38:17] season let's pray our gracious Eternal
[38:20] God we came here with Thanksgiving in
[38:24] our heart father during the day if we
[38:27] have dying to wrong forgive everyone of
[38:29] friends because you give us assurance
[38:31] that the blood of Christ washes us from
[38:34] every unbelief father as we coming to
[38:37] speak I pray God that oh Lord I am us on
[38:42] the way to email us father we did
[38:44] something that the disciples recognized
[38:48] that before the the crucifixion Lord you
[38:51] break the bread in certain way so father
[38:54] I went there they got to that place and
[38:57] you broke the bread in that way they
[39:00] recognized that it was you father and
[39:03] they said the daughter had been within
[39:06] us as he spoke unto us may you come once
[39:09] again and break the bread of of way of
[39:12] life for us may you take me aside let me
[39:16] be a blessing it all like you reject it
[39:18] may your spirit take control come please
[39:23] Jesus and take control in the name of
[39:27] our Lord Jesus Christ amen please be
[39:28] seated
[39:30] yeah so um
[39:32] so my title is a word spoken in due
[39:36] season
[39:39] and definition of a word is the thought
[39:43] expressed when you express what's in
[39:46] your thoughts it becomes a word
[39:49] so a word is the thought expressed and
[39:52] the word that we speak
[39:54] it can either make us or destroys
[39:58] because the power
[40:00] you have that power in your funk
[40:03] so it can say the right thing
[40:06] and it will bring the presence of God it
[40:09] can see another thing and it's gonna
[40:11] bring death to you
[40:13] and in most cases
[40:16] I am
[40:19] when
[40:21] a man is tried to the call
[40:25] when they get to the Rope the end of the
[40:28] road when you reach right
[40:31] and you get the end of the
[40:34] rope and it seems there's no way out for
[40:37] the individual
[40:40] and at that time because remember his
[40:42] God
[40:43] of the mountains and the god in the
[40:46] valley
[40:47] and most of the time when we're in The
[40:50] Valleys that's when you really deal with
[40:52] this
[40:54] not mostly on the Mountaintop he deal
[40:56] with us on both ways then when round the
[40:59] valley that's why sometimes he really
[41:01] deal with this and that time
[41:04] is either make or break
[41:07] and depends on what seed is being
[41:10] planted over there because
[41:12] for years I was wondering and said oh
[41:16] man what made Peter able to say that
[41:19] thou are the son of the Living God and
[41:22] so many examples that you can't
[41:24] recognize that it was a seed of God in
[41:26] them that's why they could say the right
[41:29] word at the right time
[41:31] so when you are being tried to the call
[41:34] you either going to
[41:37] defile reject God
[41:39] or say the right thing the attributing
[41:42] you who says something new to bring God
[41:44] on the scene
[41:45] and job
[41:47] was tried to the call
[41:51] but one thing I love about job
[41:53] was someone
[41:56] whose confidence was in the word of God
[42:00] even though God blessed him with all
[42:03] riches he was the richest man in his age
[42:06] but his heart was not on his riches
[42:11] there's nothing wrong to be rich
[42:14] we need money to preach the word of God
[42:18] but the question is do you allow that
[42:21] money to control you or you control the
[42:23] money
[42:24] and when you have confidence in God
[42:28] and you control that money
[42:32] the money is has is not attached to you
[42:36] that's why in Hebrews
[42:38] if you read in Hebrews 13
[42:42] going down that thing verse 4 5
[42:44] Paul said that in whatever state
[42:49] I find myself I'm content
[42:52] before that I said that do not be
[42:54] convict yourself other people's things
[42:56] the content in whatever state you find
[42:59] yourself and then somewhere he said that
[43:03] I'm able also to be abound high and also
[43:07] to be low and if you read that they says
[43:10] that
[43:12] the reason why I said that the content
[43:14] what you have it doesn't mean that you
[43:17] don't it doesn't mean that when you say
[43:19] the content it doesn't mean that you
[43:22] don't have to have any aspiration or
[43:24] even motive to do anything or just stay
[43:26] like that
[43:28] but all that Paul is trying to say that
[43:32] for God will never never leave you nor
[43:36] for safety so whatever condition that
[43:39] you find yourself in you have that
[43:42] assurance
[43:43] that God will never leave you nor for
[43:48] safety that thing has to be always
[43:51] because once you have that confidence
[43:53] that God will never leave you not
[43:56] forsake me
[43:58] you never going to stumble you're going
[44:01] to stay put because you know he will
[44:03] come on the scene when he has to show up
[44:07] you show up
[44:08] so whatever says that you have yourself
[44:11] you still have to give God thanks
[44:14] he's the god of the good times and the
[44:16] god of the by times amen those things
[44:19] may not look right but he will make it
[44:23] right is that right because you might
[44:25] not say things the way he wanted to see
[44:27] but he will tell everything and make it
[44:29] right so you have to be happy you have
[44:33] to thank God for every situation when
[44:36] you answered your prayer praise God even
[44:39] if you stand yourself to thank him
[44:41] because God will never leave you nor
[44:44] forsake you he has brought you thus far
[44:48] he's more than able to take the rest of
[44:51] the journey
[44:52] do you think you kept yourself
[44:55] he has kept you this far
[44:58] so job wasn't worried about everything
[45:02] he lost
[45:04] his faith was in God
[45:07] he he was never wavered
[45:09] by the situation
[45:12] and
[45:13] all his friends were a miserable
[45:16] comforters
[45:18] that's why sometimes when people are
[45:21] going through their trials
[45:23] you have to watch
[45:25] and let God speak to you before you try
[45:27] to speak to them because if you go by
[45:30] the flesh you're going to be a miserable
[45:32] comforter
[45:34] may God has to reveal to you the right
[45:37] way to speak in due season that will
[45:41] bring right Atmos that will help and
[45:43] encourage the individual they will just
[45:46] go by the flesh you make mistake because
[45:49] job friends they just look at the flesh
[45:52] the condition and they told him all
[45:55] kinds that you are sinner but if they
[45:57] have seen God and pray for job and see
[46:01] God's face
[46:02] they could have gone the right way and
[46:06] when you are being tested to the call
[46:10] whenever your colors will show
[46:14] and job's wife
[46:17] didn't have that seed
[46:20] she looked at the circumstance that
[46:21] cares God that Joseph said thou speaking
[46:25] like a foolish woman the lord giveth and
[46:29] the love ticket blessed be the name of
[46:31] the Lord
[46:32] and when job said that he spoke there at
[46:36] the right time and he brought the
[46:38] presence of God down and he could see
[46:40] beyond the captain of time and God
[46:43] revealed to him and he said that I know
[46:45] by redeem I leave it even if the skin
[46:48] went destroyed his body in my flesh I
[46:51] shall see God why because he spoke the
[46:55] right word at the right time tell me why
[46:58] because there's a seed of God hiding in
[47:00] there so when it gets to the the core of
[47:04] the heart when he was tried to the call
[47:07] that seed came forth
[47:09] and spoke blessed be the Lord the Lord
[47:14] take it and the Lord give it he never
[47:16] cares God
[47:17] amen he never gave up his
[47:21] um
[47:21] what right do I say is that right
[47:24] just like Esau
[47:26] when he was tried
[47:28] when he was hungry
[47:30] you see a lot of people are selling
[47:32] their best right
[47:35] the economy is in shambles now inflation
[47:38] is going higher and they take you money
[47:41] from the system so he's squeezing the
[47:44] people financially but
[47:46] a true Christian will know that the Lord
[47:49] give and the Lord taken blessed be the
[47:51] name of the Lord your confidence is in
[47:54] God Elijah when there's a farm in the
[47:57] land God sent even Ravens to feed him so
[48:00] no matter what you find yourself in this
[48:03] economic hardship your confidence should
[48:06] be in God and believe that God will
[48:08] never leave you not for safety the god
[48:12] that fed Elijah in the midst of that
[48:14] that same God is able to take care of
[48:16] you and your family amen so job never
[48:20] never let God
[48:22] that Esau was thanking the law of his
[48:26] belly
[48:27] and a lot of people are selling their
[48:30] Birthright because there is no seed in
[48:33] them
[48:35] they don't have what it takes
[48:38] to what resist because when you get to
[48:42] that place
[48:44] only the attributes can come forth and
[48:48] speak remember Abraham went to the same
[48:51] condition he lost his wife who lost his
[48:54] children he lost his daughter he lost
[48:57] his brother he lost his father around
[48:58] the same time and he wanted to give up
[49:02] even holding Electric Ball to get rid of
[49:05] his life and he didn't die and the denim
[49:08] was telling him sometimes you hear all
[49:11] kind of voices
[49:12] and those wives was not the word of God
[49:15] it was to bring depression to him
[49:18] then he was saying yes yes but that
[49:21] attribute came forth and said who am I
[49:24] William Abraham I'm from a poor family I
[49:28] didn't come with anything the lord
[49:30] giveth the Lord to get blessed be the
[49:33] name of the Lord well the attribute came
[49:35] forth and spoke the right word and trim
[49:38] the enemy what cut it
[49:42] so it says in your life and in my life
[49:46] if there is that part of God that Gene
[49:49] of God that tribute is hiding over there
[49:52] it doesn't matter what you go through
[49:55] that should be able to come forth
[49:58] and speak the right word at the right
[50:01] time that doesn't mean that in your life
[50:03] you're not going to speak wrong
[50:05] questions you're not going to make
[50:06] mistake or relearn from my experience
[50:08] and because there's a seed of God in you
[50:11] there if you want to say something wrong
[50:13] it corrects you and it brings you back
[50:15] to that word of God
[50:18] so you don't have to just
[50:21] um
[50:22] you don't have to worry about anything
[50:24] just be simple
[50:27] lead your true Christian Life and God
[50:30] will take your business somewhere Brahm
[50:33] said that
[50:34] job
[50:36] has to go through all that
[50:38] in order for him to see
[50:41] My Redeemer leader to see beyond the
[50:44] Rapture to see to get that thing he has
[50:47] to go through all that so you and me we
[50:49] are not going to have it easy Christian
[50:53] life is not a flowering birth of ease
[50:57] they said that many are afflictions of
[50:59] the righteous but God delivers them out
[51:03] of what o a l l
[51:06] he will deliver you from everything he's
[51:09] able to do it there's nothing that God
[51:12] cannot do no matter what the
[51:15] circumstances he'll bring us through
[51:17] because he's the same yesterday today
[51:20] and forever he will never leave you nor
[51:24] forsake you it is the same God
[51:27] but trials
[51:31] and afflictions is a part of Christian
[51:34] work because God has to train us
[51:38] that's why I said that if your trust is
[51:40] worth more than gold because to get the
[51:44] pure good they have to what
[51:46] um crisis Crisis crisis to get that gold
[51:49] out
[51:51] so to get that pure of field that part
[51:54] of you to fully manifest God sometimes
[51:57] allow us to go through all those things
[51:59] like the Hebrew children
[52:02] they got to a place
[52:06] and
[52:07] when I read that scripture for the first
[52:10] time
[52:11] that was so dear to my heart they said
[52:15] that we know
[52:17] they were so certain
[52:19] that their God is able
[52:23] to deliver them
[52:25] but even if that God decide not to
[52:28] deliver them they were not going to bow
[52:31] down to that Idol why does part of
[52:34] Christ in them those attributes of God
[52:37] so when they spoke that right that right
[52:40] word in due season it took them to the
[52:44] fire
[52:46] but they were not scared
[52:48] to have been in that fight because they
[52:50] have spoke the right to that she put in
[52:52] them has spoken and they have spoke the
[52:54] right word in due season
[52:57] and when they did that what happened
[53:00] they saw Jesus Christ The Fourth Man in
[53:04] the fire
[53:05] so is you and me no matter what you go
[53:09] through
[53:10] stencil and see the salvation of God
[53:14] because God is a miracle working God he
[53:19] makes a way where it seems to be no way
[53:22] he is God that answers praise His God
[53:26] that is control of you and my life amen
[53:32] because he promised he'll never leave
[53:34] you and forsake you sometimes
[53:38] God permits certain things just to try
[53:41] you
[53:43] he just trying your faith
[53:48] somebody who says something to you don't
[53:51] get angry
[53:52] just let God
[53:55] take control by the situation
[53:57] because sometimes we try to fight our
[54:00] own battles
[54:02] we try to take control over situations
[54:05] but when you leave it to God he will
[54:08] take control
[54:10] he will turn things in the right way
[54:12] because he is in control of you
[54:16] so like Mary Lazarus brother
[54:21] like your sister sorry excuse me last
[54:24] one sister
[54:26] dear brother
[54:28] was sick
[54:30] and they call on Jesus their friend
[54:34] to come
[54:35] but he never show up
[54:37] imagine
[54:38] you are sick and you call your pastor
[54:40] you never show up in the hospital
[54:43] you're the king nobody is trying to
[54:45] visit you at the time of your hospital
[54:46] your need what will be your reaction
[54:50] and when the Lord got there
[54:54] in a modern woman modern people
[54:58] they would have just
[55:01] say anything to him oh my brother was
[55:04] saying he didn't show up what are you
[55:06] doing over here now she's dead what do
[55:09] you want from here
[55:11] now is there was one of the man who was
[55:13] still all kind of thing to him but it
[55:15] wasn't Mary that tribute of God In Hell
[55:18] came to pass and she said Lord
[55:25] my brother has died but he said that
[55:30] my brother has gone
[55:33] he said but if you were here
[55:37] my brother would not have died but even
[55:40] now
[55:41] whatever
[55:43] you ask God God will grant it to you he
[55:48] has that confidence and I'm relating the
[55:51] same to you tonight you on the YouTube
[55:54] land whatever you ask God
[55:58] God will grant it to you as the word is
[56:01] coming forth whatever you have need of
[56:04] tonight
[56:05] if you can't believe and ask God he will
[56:09] bring gate to pass because all things
[56:12] are possible to them that believe if
[56:16] thou can't believe
[56:18] whatever is happening of tonight
[56:20] God is able to bring you to pass if you
[56:23] are sick accept your healing if you are
[56:26] not fully accept your healing let the
[56:28] rich say I'm strong let the blind say I
[56:31] can see amen because he's able to bring
[56:34] it to pass our God is an awesome God
[56:38] whatsoever you ask God he will grant it
[56:42] to you whatever in your heart that you
[56:44] have rid of you can claim me tonight
[56:46] because all things
[56:50] are possible
[56:52] to them
[56:54] who believe in God
[56:56] amen not sometimes
[56:59] or a-l-l are possible to them that
[57:04] believe God so right now whatever I have
[57:06] though you can claim it and what receive
[57:09] it
[57:10] hallelujah amen
[57:13] so it all comes back to
[57:16] the heart that Gene of God in you and me
[57:22] that chain can never disrespect God that
[57:26] Jane can never sin by the flesh
[57:29] that made mistakes that's why Paul said
[57:33] that the things I want to do I don't do
[57:35] the one things I don't have myself doing
[57:38] wretched me this is that refresh here
[57:40] but that chain of Christ
[57:43] it can never
[57:45] respect said that blessed is the balloon
[57:47] I will not improve sin and whose
[57:50] iniquity and so often say the seed of
[57:52] God abide in him he can never what sin
[57:58] amen so you can't sing
[58:00] so don't forget about it you are free
[58:04] just trust God
[58:06] and be reverent and God will bless you
[58:10] amen that start official woman that
[58:14] woman whose daughter was sick
[58:18] she used the wrong word
[58:20] and it didn't even turn Christ's head he
[58:24] said thou son of David have mercy on me
[58:28] he wasn't a son of David to her
[58:31] because it was
[58:33] wrong word and the wrong in the wrong
[58:38] time but when she said it's not meat for
[58:42] me
[58:43] to give the children's bread to the dog
[58:47] oh my goodness
[58:50] her mother oh my God I tell her that
[58:53] the way they'll give it to you I don't
[58:55] know
[58:56] but there was an attribute of God in
[59:00] that lady
[59:01] she said that oh God
[59:03] the Lord in the crabs
[59:06] and Jesus said he has not found such a
[59:08] faith in Israel and because she said the
[59:13] right way
[59:16] she got the right results
[59:19] so it's about speaking the right word in
[59:23] the season
[59:27] that brings the presence of God down at
[59:30] any time because he said I will never
[59:33] leave you nor for saving
[59:37] and then you can talk about
[59:41] um the Centurion
[59:43] he is a sanitarian that have 100
[59:47] Centurion means that he has a hundred
[59:50] people under him
[59:51] so when when the Lord says try he said
[59:54] that I'm not even fit for you to come to
[59:56] my house
[59:57] just speak the word because I am man of
[59:59] authority
[1:00:01] and when I say this one go here he goes
[1:00:04] this one comes and he comes so just
[1:00:07] speak the word
[1:00:10] and that shows that there is no distance
[1:00:13] in prayer
[1:00:15] but you have to recognize who you are no
[1:00:19] wonder Brothers when the bride recognize
[1:00:22] who she is
[1:00:23] she'll be an invisible Army because if
[1:00:27] you recognize Who You Are
[1:00:29] then you have the authority
[1:00:32] in the name of it says to cast out
[1:00:34] devils
[1:00:35] to raise the dead to preach to speak
[1:00:38] today to to raise the dead to to heal
[1:00:41] their sick so when you lay your hands on
[1:00:44] they say they shall recover
[1:00:46] this world word is real
[1:00:50] it's not just a letter
[1:00:52] it has to be rare to you as I'm talking
[1:00:55] to you without that you can't please
[1:00:58] because it's impossible to please God
[1:00:59] with faith without faith
[1:01:02] without faith you can please man faith
[1:01:04] is a revelation
[1:01:06] unless the things reveal to you
[1:01:09] you can never please him
[1:01:11] and that woman that man the Centurion
[1:01:15] recognize his position
[1:01:18] and when you fully recognize that he
[1:01:21] spoke the right word
[1:01:23] at the right time
[1:01:25] and he brought the presence of God and
[1:01:29] when he went to him they said he asked
[1:01:31] what time
[1:01:33] did he got healed he really got into us
[1:01:36] the self same hour
[1:01:38] exact same time
[1:01:41] when he spoke the right word
[1:01:45] so you have to a son or daughter of God
[1:01:51] the attributing you have to be positive
[1:01:54] don't look at conditions and speak
[1:01:58] according to the conditions he said let
[1:02:01] the poor say I'm rich let the Rick say
[1:02:04] I'm shrunk and believe it and step
[1:02:07] forward it will come to pass just
[1:02:10] believe and see yourself healed and you
[1:02:14] see yourself in that condition
[1:02:16] because they said yesterday today and
[1:02:20] forever if he has done it for others how
[1:02:23] can he do it for you and me because it's
[1:02:25] the same God he said Elijah was the man
[1:02:27] subject to like passion like you and I
[1:02:30] and he prayed endlessly that should not
[1:02:32] Reign for three years and and through
[1:02:35] half years didn't rain he has up and
[1:02:37] down he makes mistakes like you and me
[1:02:40] but you pray sincerely
[1:02:42] so you and I
[1:02:44] we have to be sincere we have to be
[1:02:48] serious we there's no time for the bride
[1:02:51] to sleep it's like waking up time
[1:02:55] no time to joke it's going on time
[1:02:59] so if God can do it to them he will do
[1:03:01] it rest and he's doing their lives we
[1:03:03] have a lot of
[1:03:05] a lot of testimonies
[1:03:09] so you always have to remember what God
[1:03:11] has done for us no wonder I said that
[1:03:15] um count your blessings and name them
[1:03:17] one by one it will surprise you what the
[1:03:21] Lord has done for you he's doing a
[1:03:25] mighty work all the time
[1:03:26] so you have to say the right way no
[1:03:29] wonder I said that whatsoever thinks
[1:03:32] that are of good report whatsoever
[1:03:35] things that edifies either very virtues
[1:03:38] think on those things
[1:03:41] because the things that you think around
[1:03:44] is forms an atmosphere around you
[1:03:48] Your Atmosphere comes around the things
[1:03:51] you feed in your soul on so you have to
[1:03:54] search what you are feeding your soul up
[1:03:57] unconsciously those things comes and
[1:04:00] flow through you either you like it or
[1:04:02] not if you listen to the word it flush
[1:04:05] through you you see yourself in it if
[1:04:07] you listen to what little things it's
[1:04:09] gonna flow through you the things that
[1:04:11] you feed on so much that's what gonna
[1:04:14] approach you so I said that whatsoever
[1:04:17] things is of good report because forever
[1:04:21] things that edifies if there are any
[1:04:24] verses
[1:04:25] think on those things because God is not
[1:04:29] to something big amen and a part of it
[1:04:33] hallelujah praise God
[1:04:37] so what am I talking about here
[1:04:57] when
[1:04:59] Moses met God
[1:05:01] in that burning bush
[1:05:05] God talked to Moses
[1:05:07] and Muslims talked to him
[1:05:10] in that bedding voice
[1:05:13] and if God calls you I believe he talks
[1:05:16] to you
[1:05:17] and you have to talk back to him
[1:05:20] we God is real brother
[1:05:24] it's not just a picture here it's a
[1:05:26] living God
[1:05:28] one time
[1:05:30] when
[1:05:31] I was just new in this church
[1:05:34] I was leaving Mississauga I ran Dairy
[1:05:37] and everything there and I had some
[1:05:39] problem was bothering me and I was
[1:05:42] coming to tell pastor I'm not saying
[1:05:44] that when you have an issue don't bring
[1:05:45] it because if you keep their things to
[1:05:48] yourself you alone struggle with it but
[1:05:50] when you tell so many people you get
[1:05:52] that back they share it with you but
[1:05:54] every situation how God want to deal
[1:05:57] with it
[1:05:58] so thinking and praying over it and a
[1:06:01] voice saying Abraham was a friend of God
[1:06:05] and God speak to him lives to you why
[1:06:09] can't you tell your problem to God
[1:06:10] yourself I became conscious of myself
[1:06:13] and I cried unto God and have an answer
[1:06:17] it doesn't mean that when I have a
[1:06:19] situation I don't bring I'll bring it
[1:06:20] but God has to reveal to you which one
[1:06:23] has to come because somewhere Brian said
[1:06:26] if you have that Faith you don't even
[1:06:28] need to bring the prayer line because
[1:06:30] they felt like mustard seed it will not
[1:06:33] mess with anything
[1:06:35] that we have we help one who chased a
[1:06:38] thousand to chase ten thousand but
[1:06:41] sometimes God's wanna be real to you and
[1:06:44] the history said that come talk to me
[1:06:46] son I'm here to listen to you amen
[1:06:49] because Moses talk to God and God talked
[1:06:53] to him you are not different from the
[1:06:55] same God
[1:06:56] thousand Moses in you and me
[1:07:00] it was not Moses
[1:07:02] who did all those 10 miracles it was not
[1:07:06] Moses who stopped the Red Sea it was not
[1:07:09] Moses that are it was God in Moses
[1:07:13] during their miracles it wasn't blah
[1:07:16] blah
[1:07:19] um it was the Brahm what telling the
[1:07:23] people
[1:07:25] um brother bread your son is this
[1:07:27] towards God in the prophet during that
[1:07:30] Miracles how can he knows your address
[1:07:33] and everything it wasn't him
[1:07:35] so I was calling him
[1:07:37] doing those things and that same God is
[1:07:41] in you and me
[1:07:43] doing that success in our life in a
[1:07:46] small way in accordance their faith the
[1:07:49] measure of your faith
[1:07:51] it has never been a people it was
[1:07:54] calling them the attribute part of God
[1:07:56] in them in this place it wasn't
[1:07:58] something it was God in something how
[1:08:02] can a young a young man carry just take
[1:08:06] a boy and kill thousand people and kill
[1:08:09] lion and all those things how can he do
[1:08:12] it trust God behind him and that same
[1:08:16] God
[1:08:17] has put on flesh in you you see they're
[1:08:21] looking at him back there on Calvary but
[1:08:24] now he's in you and me some flesh
[1:08:27] walking along the aisle and the people
[1:08:29] can recognize him that's why I have to
[1:08:31] recognize God what he's doing in due
[1:08:35] season the right threat at the right
[1:08:38] time will bring him on the same he's the
[1:08:40] same yesterday today and forever God has
[1:08:45] never changed Hallelujah the same God
[1:08:49] because listen even the Lord Jesus
[1:08:52] Christ he has to be crucified before
[1:08:55] Ascension
[1:08:57] we can't have it any other way
[1:09:00] is that right everywhere in the
[1:09:02] scriptures is crucifixion before
[1:09:05] Ascension
[1:09:07] you're gonna go through trust before it
[1:09:10] can be worked go to all of sin and fall
[1:09:13] of Fame it's all of critics before Hall
[1:09:16] of Fame
[1:09:17] you can't have it any other way
[1:09:20] so we have to have in your heart
[1:09:23] and believe God
[1:09:25] that whatever comes my way my life is in
[1:09:29] your hand my life is in God's hand you
[1:09:33] have to be in that place recognize that
[1:09:36] you are the clay here is the Potter he
[1:09:40] has to make us and Shepherds according
[1:09:42] to his own will amen is God that doesn't
[1:09:45] want to be moved by a sheep hear the
[1:09:48] voice of the shepherd a sheep is willing
[1:09:52] to be led a sheep is willing to be led
[1:09:55] by his master amen so you have to come
[1:09:58] to a place
[1:10:00] that you have surrendered everything to
[1:10:03] him
[1:10:04] that he
[1:10:07] is the Potter
[1:10:09] reality
[1:10:12] wherever he does
[1:10:14] he's right
[1:10:16] shall not exist until they have due
[1:10:18] right
[1:10:19] Abraham have his own trial
[1:10:23] the very thing that was so dear to him
[1:10:26] Isaac
[1:10:29] he was asked to sacrifice
[1:10:32] and when the time come
[1:10:34] that she would came from for me he said
[1:10:37] me and the Lord are going to worship and
[1:10:40] we come back
[1:10:42] how can he have that confidence
[1:10:44] and when he said that
[1:10:46] he spoke the right word in due season
[1:10:49] and it brought the presence of God when
[1:10:53] the time came for him to kill Isaac God
[1:10:56] provided him
[1:10:58] spoke
[1:11:00] that sacrifice and the same God
[1:11:03] that spoke Abraham's needs into
[1:11:06] existence he is able tonight to speak
[1:11:10] your needs into existence if thou can't
[1:11:14] believe the only thing that prevent God
[1:11:18] to bring things back is your own belief
[1:11:20] if you do not doubt it might be me and
[1:11:23] say to this mountain be moved it will
[1:11:26] move it's all based on faith
[1:11:30] if you do not doubt
[1:11:33] and believe
[1:11:35] and say to this mountain
[1:11:38] did I removed it will come to pass
[1:11:42] and Abraham spoke the right way until
[1:11:46] season
[1:11:47] and God spoke his knees into existence
[1:11:51] and God will speak your knees into
[1:11:54] existence when you say the right word in
[1:11:57] due season amen that trouble to speak to
[1:12:00] you don't worry when the time comes when
[1:12:03] the meat arrives he because I said that
[1:12:06] he will never give you anything that you
[1:12:10] cannot bear and when enemy rides like a
[1:12:13] flood he always gonna raise a standard
[1:12:17] the standard is the word of God it's a
[1:12:20] revelation part of it not only the
[1:12:22] written part the Revelation part that's
[1:12:25] why the devil don't have nothing to do
[1:12:26] with it amen because they are so focused
[1:12:29] on the written back forgetting that he's
[1:12:32] the same yesterday to them forever they
[1:12:34] forgot the unwritten portion Rhythm
[1:12:37] between the lies you don't want it
[1:12:39] because they don't have what it takes
[1:12:41] but you have that quality you it is
[1:12:44] giving to know the kingdom of to know
[1:12:46] the mystery of the Kingdom to them it's
[1:12:48] not giving amen praise God hallelujah
[1:12:54] thank you Jesus
[1:12:57] amen
[1:12:59] so what is happening now
[1:13:02] is the same God that was in Moses
[1:13:06] Moses LED them
[1:13:08] through the wilderness
[1:13:10] and when you get to that
[1:13:12] Red Sea
[1:13:15] he was so begin to cry and God said why
[1:13:19] Cry by speak
[1:13:22] he spoke and they went forth so he did
[1:13:24] his part but it got to a place that God
[1:13:28] finished with Moses
[1:13:30] so Joshua was the one who has to leave
[1:13:33] them the promised land and Joshua is the
[1:13:36] one that's what placed the children of
[1:13:38] Israel The Inheritance in there and
[1:13:41] Joshua type the Holy Ghost leading us
[1:13:44] back to the to the promised land God has
[1:13:48] sent us a Vindicated Prophet that said
[1:13:51] the Lord William Brown Abraham never
[1:13:53] been a time that God has used a human
[1:13:55] being like that because it wasn't him it
[1:13:58] was God in him the son of man being
[1:14:00] revealed at that time amen and that you
[1:14:03] said that yourself almost is the source
[1:14:06] a day do not depart from left or the
[1:14:08] right so God has taken the prophet out
[1:14:10] is that right by the same God
[1:14:13] that was in the prophet in the form of
[1:14:16] the Holy Ghost is leading the bride
[1:14:18] again because remember the son of man's
[1:14:21] son was when God incarnate himself in
[1:14:23] the flesh when God take control over the
[1:14:25] Flesh and live in that individual around
[1:14:27] the world become flesh he didn't become
[1:14:30] the Sonoma so it is the son of man being
[1:14:33] revealed again in the bright form
[1:14:37] that's what is happening it's Joshua
[1:14:39] Ministry
[1:14:41] it's a Holy Ghost
[1:14:43] leading us back the mighty angel
[1:14:47] he's the one leading us back to the
[1:14:49] rapture amen the rapturing time
[1:14:53] Hallelujah
[1:14:55] and
[1:14:56] I'm just gonna
[1:14:58] read this quotation
[1:15:00] then I'm gonna wrap it up
[1:15:03] it's Look Away to Jesus one of them is
[1:15:06] the proven he swear that yes you shall
[1:15:09] give me all the best paragraph 35 is the
[1:15:12] Lord you only give me a small portion
[1:15:14] put all the paragraph 35 when I might
[1:15:16] okay let me look away to Jesus first
[1:15:20] paragraph 48
[1:15:23] well
[1:15:25] he said it's practically that way now
[1:15:29] you can't go to a church
[1:15:32] and preach unless you have a fellowship
[1:15:35] card
[1:15:36] or some identification
[1:15:39] and now on Persons like ourselves
[1:15:43] we are going to be cut out of all that
[1:15:46] all together that's exactly cause they
[1:15:52] won't be able to do it
[1:15:55] it's tightening
[1:15:57] and then when that time comes
[1:16:01] and the Press come to a place
[1:16:03] to where you are pressed out
[1:16:06] then watch what I'm facing to tell you
[1:16:10] in few minutes
[1:16:12] watch the third pool then
[1:16:16] see and it will be absolutely to the
[1:16:19] total loss but it will be for the bride
[1:16:22] and the church
[1:16:24] now we are closer than it seems to be
[1:16:29] I don't know when there is real real
[1:16:33] close I may be building a platform for
[1:16:38] somebody else to step in
[1:16:40] to step on I may be taken before that
[1:16:43] time
[1:16:44] I don't know and that time may be this
[1:16:46] coming week that the holy spirit will
[1:16:49] come with and bring crises he may come
[1:16:52] this next week he may come yet tonight I
[1:16:57] don't know when he will come
[1:17:00] he doesn't tell us that but I do believe
[1:17:03] that you are so close that it I'll never
[1:17:07] die with old age yet at 54 years old
[1:17:12] I'll never die with old age until he's
[1:17:16] here see unless I'm short kill or
[1:17:20] something other some way killed just old
[1:17:23] age won't kill me until his time come
[1:17:26] and I believe that and I want to say
[1:17:28] this
[1:17:29] I've never said it before
[1:17:32] but according to scripture according
[1:17:35] what he said 30 years ago 33 years ago
[1:17:39] on the river down there in 1933 rather
[1:17:42] what he said everything has happened
[1:17:45] just exactly I may not do it but this
[1:17:50] message
[1:17:52] will introduce Jesus Christ to the world
[1:17:55] for us John the Baptist was sent to fall
[1:17:58] around the first coming so is the
[1:18:01] message to forerun the second coming and
[1:18:04] John said Behold the Lamb of God that
[1:18:08] takes away the sin of wealth
[1:18:11] see so its power it in every way and I
[1:18:17] know a twelve the message will go on we
[1:18:20] all know that
[1:18:22] when the cease was revealed
[1:18:24] the title became available
[1:18:28] it's available to us
[1:18:30] but what I'm trying to say God is
[1:18:34] dealing with us in a secret way it
[1:18:36] doesn't put us right now in an open show
[1:18:39] just like David I believe that when God
[1:18:44] was dealing with David with a bear and
[1:18:47] the lion nobody saw that it was a word
[1:18:51] god dealing with David in a secret place
[1:18:54] and God is dealing with you and me
[1:18:58] we having victory over here having
[1:19:00] testimony over here having
[1:19:02] um
[1:19:03] um
[1:19:05] having a victory here and there just
[1:19:08] like David it wasn't David it wasn't
[1:19:10] just a slingshot it was faith that led
[1:19:14] that but it came to a time that what God
[1:19:18] has been dealing with David in a secret
[1:19:20] maybe all his brothers knew that God was
[1:19:24] dealing with him that way that he was
[1:19:26] able to kill as as a lion when attacked
[1:19:29] his ship he was able to kill that bear
[1:19:32] when the attack is sheep only few people
[1:19:34] know but it came a time that God put him
[1:19:37] on display between Goliath and when that
[1:19:40] time came everybody saw Who David was so
[1:19:45] is the bride of Christ God has been
[1:19:47] hiding us people don't know what is
[1:19:50] going on they haven't seen that but
[1:19:52] there is going to be a short break work
[1:19:54] God is going to this place right for the
[1:19:58] whole world to see what's inside of us
[1:20:00] but unless the title didn't come unless
[1:20:05] they close the church all those that is
[1:20:07] hidingness is going to come in full
[1:20:10] strength
[1:20:11] we are manifesting it I'm not saying
[1:20:13] that it's hidden it's here
[1:20:16] everything that I really fear with us is
[1:20:19] that right but when that thing comes
[1:20:21] when that crush them when that
[1:20:23] desperation ceasing whatever it is
[1:20:26] either by God is going to trust
[1:20:29] to the whole world we know that bride of
[1:20:32] Christ on this plane it's not going to
[1:20:35] be hidden anymore
[1:20:36] they have the world hasn't seen nothing
[1:20:39] yet
[1:20:40] the bride is coming in this place and
[1:20:43] the short time you're gonna be happy
[1:20:45] when they cross the church we're going
[1:20:47] up amen it doesn't matter what they do
[1:20:51] it's economic pressure political
[1:20:54] pressure and religious pressure all
[1:20:57] culminating against the bride of Christ
[1:20:59] that God raises the standard
[1:21:03] and the same God that spoke sister had
[1:21:06] to write
[1:21:08] son salvation that gave the life to that
[1:21:12] little fish that spoiled those Spirits
[1:21:15] in existence that same God is going to
[1:21:18] display the bride for the people to know
[1:21:21] that he is hiding behind us it's not you
[1:21:25] or me there is the same Holy Ghost
[1:21:29] don't get me wrong God the table is here
[1:21:34] he's manifest himself in the little way
[1:21:36] here in the corner here here people
[1:21:39] don't know but what God is doing he's
[1:21:41] giving you and me as an experience
[1:21:43] because he dealt with David
[1:21:46] by himself alone
[1:21:49] to have those experience
[1:21:52] to when he came
[1:21:53] for the show between him and Goliath he
[1:21:56] wasn't scared
[1:21:57] because God has dealt with him the
[1:21:59] backside of the desert
[1:22:02] so that same Mighty Angel is dealing
[1:22:06] with you and me
[1:22:08] giving us that Victory here
[1:22:11] when the time comes The Showdown that
[1:22:14] attribute of God you will show up don't
[1:22:17] worry
[1:22:18] that part of God that seed of God in you
[1:22:22] will show up and light up that people
[1:22:26] who know who this God is that God of
[1:22:29] rabraham he said Living God
[1:22:31] he's not a dead God
[1:22:33] amen and it will be long
[1:22:36] everything is pointing the coming of
[1:22:40] Christ
[1:22:42] everything that you were saying is
[1:22:44] coming is coming is coming has come
[1:22:46] before you were saying this is coming
[1:22:48] that is coming but we see it now without
[1:22:53] playing unless you are blind
[1:22:56] you see everything unfolding
[1:23:00] the gospel is going back to the Jews
[1:23:03] they will have the atonement those seven
[1:23:05] trumpets
[1:23:06] and we'll go home
[1:23:08] because now they have the right thing
[1:23:12] who are fighting for the land
[1:23:15] nobody knows
[1:23:18] that is is the time saying
[1:23:21] it's getting closer than we think
[1:23:25] and very soon you take his binder it
[1:23:28] shows us that the marriage of the Lamb
[1:23:31] is here and his wife had made herself
[1:23:35] ready
[1:23:37] amen the wife of Christ has made herself
[1:23:43] ready
[1:23:46] is going long time brother sister
[1:23:49] is going on time
[1:23:51] so the gospel has to go to the Jews and
[1:23:54] the two professors to come before then
[1:23:57] we are going up
[1:24:01] we are going up
[1:24:04] when brother Philip I can't tell but I
[1:24:07] can say it's right around the corner
[1:24:11] so let's have our lamb streamed
[1:24:14] amen um I think I'll end over here by
[1:24:17] David can you just come
[1:24:21] yes so all that I'm saying that is here
