[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] hello
[0:14] friends once again we are together again
[0:20] last wednesday
[0:23] we talked about the lovely
[0:26] and precious name of jesus
[0:30] what a wonderful name
[0:33] today we would love to speak
[0:37] on the subject of god's
[0:42] disappointment once again
[0:45] my subject today will be god's
[0:49] disappointment and our
[0:52] scripture reading is found in
[0:55] revelation chapter 2
[0:58] verse 5 let us
[1:02] read from the word of god
[1:10] nevertheless
[1:12] i have somewhat against thee
[1:17] because thou hast left
[1:21] thy first love
[1:24] remember therefore from whence the word
[1:28] fallen
[1:30] and repent and
[1:33] do the first works or
[1:36] else i will come
[1:39] unto thee quickly and
[1:43] will remove thy candlestick
[1:46] out of his place except
[1:50] thou repent
[1:54] our gracious god and heavenly father
[1:58] we ask your blessing upon the word
[2:02] we pray that you will take glory and
[2:05] honor and praise
[2:08] as we surrender ourselves
[2:11] to your gracious leading and
[2:14] care in jesus name we ask it
[2:18] amen and amen
[2:21] now in our scripture we read
[2:25] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[2:28] thee
[2:30] because thou hast left
[2:33] thy first love now
[2:37] we understand that the holy spirit
[2:41] is not just speaking to the ephesian
[2:44] saints but he is
[2:47] speaking to the original
[2:51] saints of that entire
[2:55] age which lasted
[2:58] for a period of about 128 years
[3:04] now we realize this principle of history
[3:09] that history repeats
[3:12] itself and just as it was in israel
[3:18] that god would send his holy fire
[3:22] there will be a great move of god in
[3:25] the nation of israel and
[3:28] after a while through the various
[3:31] generations
[3:33] that fire will begin to die
[3:36] down until it passes away
[3:41] and there's a need for another revival
[3:47] they will try to many would try to
[3:50] uh let's say hold on to the embers
[3:54] of the past revival try to stalk it
[3:58] trying to
[3:59] uh blow on it and trying to have another
[4:02] wind
[4:02] passing on the uh revival
[4:06] that was already passed and gone and
[4:08] just the glowing embers
[4:11] are there and so
[4:15] they will try to do that but that
[4:18] revival will
[4:19] fade into the next
[4:24] now we find out that when god lights a
[4:26] fire wherever
[4:30] whoever and which in whichever age it is
[4:35] the principle continues on
[4:38] and the same process is repeated again
[4:44] now this principle is
[4:47] that god has no grandchildren
[4:51] that is a religious lie of the day
[4:55] that one could be saved
[4:59] by friends by being born
[5:02] into a christian home
[5:06] and i want you to know here
[5:10] that christianity cannot be passed on
[5:16] one cannot be born
[5:19] believing or born a christian
[5:23] just because one has been born into a
[5:26] christian home
[5:28] or or in a so-called christian church
[5:32] for christianity and genuine
[5:36] revelation is not passed on
[5:39] by natural human birth
[5:43] it is only given by divine
[5:47] revelation through divine election and
[5:51] choice of god
[5:52] god himself my friends
[5:56] decides to whom he will have mercy
[6:00] to whom he will show mercy to whom he
[6:04] will reveal his word
[6:06] to whom he will open the
[6:09] book of life and let
[6:13] that person read their name or
[6:16] recognize that their part
[6:19] is in that book of god's lamb's
[6:23] book of life so we have established
[6:27] salvation is not true natural birth
[6:32] it is not passed on by natural
[6:35] endowments
[6:37] and we earn we do not receive it by the
[6:40] will of man
[6:41] or by the blood of man
[6:44] also we see also there
[6:48] in the religious lie
[6:51] this fallacy of apostolic succession
[6:56] there is no such a thing as apostolic
[7:00] succession one
[7:02] has to receive that gift by god
[7:08] one has to be sent upon the earth as one
[7:11] of the
[7:12] five-fold ministry other than that
[7:16] there is no such a thing as apostolic
[7:20] succession
[7:21] that can be passed on from
[7:24] one dignitary to another dignitary
[7:27] for a hundred years 200 years 300 years
[7:31] whatever it is it cannot be
[7:34] passed on it is only
[7:37] by god's gift who says
[7:41] i made you an apostle i made you a
[7:44] prophet
[7:45] i'm the one that gifted you to be a
[7:48] pastor a teacher
[7:50] an administrator whatever that is it
[7:53] must be by the holy spirit and by the
[7:56] hand of almighty
[7:58] god that one is in that position
[8:03] so it is a totally unscriptural
[8:07] uh teaching to
[8:10] teach or to believe in such a
[8:14] thing as apostolic succession
[8:17] as exalted as it may seem
[8:21] as great as it may be made to appear
[8:25] it is nothing in the very eyes of god
[8:30] it is nothing i say in the eyes of god
[8:34] for it is a complete and total
[8:38] religious lie now friends
[8:41] if it isn't in the word it is
[8:45] not of god and it's against the will
[8:48] and purpose of god hallelujah you see
[8:51] it's the same problem
[8:54] every age starts out with genuine
[8:58] truly born again anointed believers
[9:03] anointed by the power of the holy spirit
[9:07] and having a clear revelation
[9:10] of the word for their age
[9:13] and over a process of time
[9:18] that belief that faith that revelation
[9:22] that was given to them
[9:26] we find out it starts dying out and the
[9:29] next generation as it was then so is it
[9:32] now
[9:33] even in this message of this hour when
[9:36] the next generation comes along
[9:39] they uh accept and believe
[9:42] that they have it just as much as the
[9:44] first generation
[9:46] but in actual fact the fate
[9:49] begins to digress it begins to
[9:53] degenerate
[9:54] and it begins my friends to drift away
[9:58] from the original fire inspiration
[10:02] anointing face of the word of god
[10:06] it begins to go away from the people
[10:10] and so friends we find that
[10:14] within the those believers
[10:19] whether in this message or not in the
[10:21] message
[10:22] they begin to develop a party spirit
[10:26] they begin to have their
[10:30] um confidences
[10:33] and their faith in dignitaries
[10:38] high-class persons personalities
[10:41] my friends drifting away
[10:45] from the aggressive and progressive
[10:49] original faith of the word of god
[10:54] it seems too crude too primitive
[10:58] too rough that's what we expect
[11:02] it needs to be uh cultured and
[11:06] educated and mannerly it needs to be
[11:09] uh theologized and it needs to have its
[11:13] uh systems within
[11:16] the message groups within the churches
[11:20] we're supposed to have appropriate and
[11:23] proper
[11:24] systems my friends that's the very thing
[11:27] that satan loves
[11:28] because he knows he can follow you with
[11:30] the system you're predictable he knows
[11:33] every action you're going to take
[11:35] time after time and he can arrest you he
[11:38] can defeat you can destroy you
[11:40] because you're acting and moving by
[11:44] man-made systems beautiful as they will
[11:48] seem
[11:49] wonderful as they will appear orderly
[11:52] as they will appear to us my friends
[11:56] but not like the spirit of god which
[11:59] what we're
[12:00] listed and does what it has to do and
[12:03] no man knows where the spirit of god is
[12:07] moving
[12:08] hallelujah and so is the true believers
[12:11] of the son of god of god sons and
[12:14] daughters
[12:14] they appear to be unpredictable why
[12:18] because they are led by the spirit
[12:22] of almighty god from that stage of being
[12:25] true believers
[12:27] taking on a party spirit then the next
[12:31] step is begin to
[12:32] take on man-made names
[12:36] whatever those religious names are
[12:39] they begin to take on denominational
[12:41] names
[12:42] and name themselves and are
[12:45] recognized by those human
[12:48] names which are not christian but are
[12:52] man made hallelujah we are born to do
[12:55] the will of god
[12:58] and not the will of man certainly
[13:01] friends
[13:02] or praise god the original fire
[13:05] dies down and people began to do the
[13:09] will of
[13:09] man and the will of the world
[13:12] rather than the will and plain and
[13:15] purpose of god
[13:18] and soon there the fervent burning
[13:21] desire within
[13:23] the hearts of believers to carry out
[13:26] god's plan
[13:27] to carry out god's message
[13:30] oh to let the candle be lit
[13:34] and run with the message that god places
[13:37] within the heart that fire is
[13:40] gone and that desire
[13:44] and passion that we once had
[13:48] to know god in his word
[13:51] a drifting begins to take place drifting
[13:54] away
[13:55] from listening to the voice of god's
[13:58] servant
[13:59] prophet drifting away from
[14:02] studying reading and meditating
[14:05] hours within the word of god for
[14:09] our day and for our time yes sir
[14:13] and the cry in the hearts of the people
[14:17] personal and individual devotion and
[14:20] prayer
[14:21] time in god's presence seeking him
[14:25] with a burning heart's desire to
[14:28] know him whom to know his life eternal
[14:32] in the power of the holy spirit
[14:35] that cry that passion that desire
[14:39] begins to die down and die away
[14:43] from the people they literally as the
[14:46] scripture says
[14:47] have to press their way in with
[14:50] spiritual
[14:51] violence to be able to break through the
[14:54] dark clouds of satanic oppression
[14:57] to be able to break out into the
[15:00] presence of the anointing of the holy
[15:02] spirit
[15:03] of the living god amen praise
[15:06] god yes sir and what happens
[15:09] instead of the people and the church
[15:12] itself
[15:13] being unfair with the fire of god
[15:17] the it begins to cool off the church
[15:20] begins to cool off
[15:22] the preacher begins to cool off the
[15:24] believers the people
[15:26] begin to cool off from the fire of god
[15:29] and the anointing
[15:30] which they once had just as it did
[15:34] back in ephesus so is it happening today
[15:38] even now
[15:40] while i am yet speaking people begin to
[15:43] get a bit
[15:44] formal within the very
[15:47] house of god no more can you have a
[15:51] genuine
[15:52] amen hallelujah praise god
[15:55] if you ever get into a a state
[15:58] like that where the spirit of the living
[16:01] god
[16:02] takes a hold of you then you are
[16:04] considered
[16:06] pentecostal emotional
[16:09] you're considered unbalanced in some way
[16:12] well i tell you maybe they were on
[16:15] balance
[16:16] in that upper room oh praise god
[16:19] they were up in that attic given praise
[16:22] and honor and glory to god
[16:24] and that's why they were called fan
[16:27] attics
[16:28] but i thank god that i can be one of
[16:31] those
[16:32] that went to the attic and came back
[16:35] out with the glory and the jew of the
[16:38] holy
[16:39] spirit resting upon one's life
[16:42] hallelujah
[16:43] blessed be this wonderful name amen
[16:47] and so we can begin to
[16:50] get a bit formal
[16:53] and lose our sincerity our abundant
[16:58] our giving over ourselves the
[17:01] complete and total lordship
[17:05] and governorship of the holy spirit
[17:10] that god would have the preeminence
[17:13] within our life and within our walk
[17:16] all glory to his marvelous and wonderful
[17:20] name we find
[17:24] believers beginning to
[17:28] think about what people think about them
[17:32] what onlookers think about them
[17:37] what the world and the other churches
[17:40] think about them rather than measuring
[17:44] themselves
[17:45] by the word of god to see what god
[17:49] thinks about them in his
[17:52] word yes sir people are no more
[17:56] careful of what god is thinking about
[18:00] them
[18:02] they're more careful about the world
[18:05] will talk and think and visualize
[18:10] about them as it was
[18:14] in the nation of israel the first
[18:17] generation
[18:20] on fire with the holy spirit
[18:24] and then like any other nation
[18:27] they wanted to have a king
[18:31] they wanted to have a visible king
[18:36] to lead them and to guide them in their
[18:39] going
[18:40] out and in their coming in
[18:44] they wanted to have a palace
[18:47] they wanted to have a formal place of
[18:50] worship
[18:52] wanted to have a standardized a book of
[18:55] beliefs
[18:57] and behavior oh
[19:00] my friends this same
[19:03] is happening in our day in our time
[19:08] the message is being cheated and watered
[19:11] down
[19:13] believers scattered running everywhere
[19:15] looking for what
[19:17] searching to have some kind of a
[19:20] man-made leadership they want to have a
[19:24] dignitary a a famous
[19:27] person a well-known person
[19:31] dignified to rule over them
[19:35] now they want nothing to do with no
[19:37] bodies
[19:38] they want nothing to do with as they
[19:41] would have called jesus or paul
[19:43] wayside preachers preachers that have no
[19:47] churches of any consequence
[19:50] they want nothing to do with men women
[19:53] men women children young people
[19:56] believers that appear
[19:58] as if they are uneducated and ordinary
[20:03] they want to have people so-called of
[20:06] quality
[20:07] and that's fine but let me tell you the
[20:10] word of god and the revelation within
[20:14] the heart of the believer
[20:15] is the most important thing so we must
[20:19] hold to god's unchanging hand
[20:22] of his word that he has delivered unto
[20:25] us
[20:26] in our day and in our time friends
[20:29] i believe romans chapter 12
[20:34] tells us clearly
[20:37] verse 2
[20:40] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[20:44] mercies of god
[20:46] that you present your bodies a living
[20:50] sacrifice
[20:52] holy acceptable unto god
[20:56] which is your reasonable service
[21:00] and be not conformed to this world
[21:05] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[21:10] your
[21:10] mind that you may prove
[21:14] what is the good and acceptable
[21:19] and perfect will of
[21:22] god oh my friends
[21:25] praise god forevermore we see here in
[21:30] god's word
[21:31] clearly praise his wonderful name
[21:35] that we ought to change
[21:38] our manner
[21:42] we ought to change the way we act the
[21:45] way we live
[21:47] and with this falling away
[21:50] from the genuine word and promise
[21:54] of the day you'll notice the
[21:57] way of dressing among the people began
[22:00] to change the standards begin to drop
[22:05] their attitudes begin to become
[22:10] different
[22:12] their behavior is also changed
[22:17] what is it they become lacks
[22:20] and loose and here we
[22:23] understand the meaning of the
[22:27] word or the name ephesus
[22:31] the meaning of the same ephesus means
[22:34] relaxed it means
[22:37] drifting oh friends
[22:40] when we started out on our journey
[22:44] we were so brisk we were so on
[22:47] our guard we were so fired up anointed
[22:51] by the holy spirit then we begin to
[22:54] become relaxed
[22:55] and we started to drift away
[22:58] from the original face drifting
[23:03] like a piece of driftwood drifting to
[23:06] that
[23:06] awesome falls where we are
[23:09] taken to the rapids of destruction
[23:13] where they we are taken away we can't
[23:16] really
[23:16] the people can hardly resist because
[23:19] they have become
[23:20] driftwood rotten to the core
[23:23] ready to break off from the original
[23:27] branch and to be swept away my friends
[23:30] here it is we're finding a lot of
[23:33] driftwood
[23:34] within those that claim to believe
[23:38] the word of god drifting away from the
[23:42] word of god this cycle of revival
[23:47] and a slow creeping spiritual death
[23:51] has never ceased or failed
[23:55] all recall the last move
[23:58] of god in the spirit
[24:01] when god moved upon men and women
[24:04] who dress like christians who talk like
[24:08] christians
[24:08] who walk like christian who live like
[24:11] christian
[24:12] when the church prayed all night have
[24:15] all night prayer meetings and
[24:18] when the people took to street corners
[24:21] with a
[24:22] tambourine and a guitar and giving
[24:25] praise
[24:25] and honor and glory to god now we are
[24:28] too high class
[24:29] highfalutin and that type of stuff
[24:32] has become now beneath us until
[24:35] believers literally feel ashamed
[24:38] to go stand by a street corner and have
[24:41] a street meeting
[24:42] they feel ashamed to go out and to talk
[24:46] to people
[24:47] about jesus christ they feel ashamed
[24:50] if they have a a preacher that was
[24:53] thrown in jail like paul many times
[24:56] they're ashamed to associate with a man
[24:59] whose
[25:00] name is in the mud and muck
[25:03] of the world because he preached the
[25:06] gospel
[25:07] gun barrel straight and the
[25:10] denominations hated him
[25:12] hated this message and wanted his head
[25:16] to take it away because he's striking
[25:19] only the correct themes and striking
[25:22] the fullness of the word of god
[25:26] but thank god for those all saints
[25:30] they were not ashamed of the
[25:32] manifestation of the holy spirit
[25:36] we see the satan with his systems with
[25:40] his power
[25:41] he's trying to take that out of the
[25:43] church matter of fact he's trying to
[25:44] close down the church if he can
[25:46] he already has it so in a minor sense
[25:49] but he wants to close it down completely
[25:52] he wants to take away manifestations
[25:56] of the holy spirit where you can't
[25:58] hardly shout praise god glory to his
[26:01] name
[26:01] and honor and worship him the way you
[26:04] should
[26:05] yes he is trying to take it all away
[26:08] but will stand by the truth until
[26:11] the crown regain
[26:14] yes those days
[26:18] when we left our old dead
[26:21] denominational churches
[26:24] and worshiped in homes
[26:29] and i remember those house meetings
[26:33] going from house to house
[26:36] the days of the old brush arbor meetings
[26:40] dinner on the ground breaking breath
[26:44] together
[26:45] giving god glory and praise
[26:48] oh hallelujah oh what a time
[26:54] renting an old school
[26:57] building or an old storefront
[27:02] i remember one of the churches the lord
[27:05] enabled me to
[27:06] start the original it was in an all
[27:09] broken down garage
[27:12] and that's all we could get
[27:16] stones bricks empty bottles
[27:20] were thrown at us for the preaching of
[27:24] the saith the lord we've come to
[27:28] get into the place we had rented
[27:31] men will be waiting there with two by
[27:34] fours
[27:36] and a planks oh
[27:39] praise god but we counted it all
[27:42] joy to be able to suffer in the
[27:46] name of the lord jesus christ oh thank
[27:48] god for those old saints
[27:50] who rejoiced in the lord praised his
[27:54] name and walked in the light of the word
[27:57] with faith and with confidence knowing
[28:00] that
[28:00] this word that was given to us is the
[28:03] original word
[28:04] is the message for the hour is the word
[28:08] for the day
[28:09] and thank god we recognize our day
[28:13] and the message for our day
[28:16] but after a while god began to bless
[28:20] the numbers began to grow the churches
[28:22] began to grow
[28:23] we started to get some money
[28:26] and so we started to build better
[28:29] buildings
[28:30] and better buildings
[28:33] and after a while
[28:36] we started to have groups singing groups
[28:41] choirs singing for us
[28:44] and of course instead of the people
[28:48] singing for themselves
[28:50] they now have singing groups singing for
[28:52] them and choirs
[28:54] singing for them and the bars were let
[28:57] down
[28:58] the goats came in and those goats began
[29:02] to take over
[29:03] because they were thinking money money
[29:05] money man
[29:07] they were taking in every possible way
[29:10] of how to manipulate
[29:12] and how to use the message to monetize
[29:15] themselves
[29:16] and to grow themselves in every possible
[29:20] way
[29:21] and not so much as for the glory of god
[29:24] yes they were mounting that that it's
[29:27] all
[29:27] it's for the glory of god it's for the
[29:30] growth of the
[29:31] kingdom of god but while they're saying
[29:34] that verbally my friends literally
[29:38] there were actually building up a
[29:40] financial
[29:42] material numerical kingdom
[29:45] for man's glory and not to the glory of
[29:49] god
[29:49] of course a few true believers will be
[29:52] mixed into that group but whatever it is
[29:55] i'm telling you of the intent at that
[29:58] time
[29:59] and saw the cry of joy
[30:03] began to leave from amongst the
[30:05] believers
[30:07] the freedom of the holy spirit right in
[30:10] the church
[30:11] begins to be clapped down upon
[30:14] until believers felt that they were
[30:17] under
[30:18] they were under control and they were
[30:20] not allowed to behave
[30:22] as the spirit of god would have them to
[30:24] believe
[30:25] to behave i'm not talking about a way
[30:28] out behavior
[30:29] but i'm talking about the holy spirit be
[30:32] anointing and
[30:33] using the believers as he would
[30:36] for his glory oh they began to take on
[30:40] the form
[30:41] because the fire of god was dying down
[30:44] and
[30:45] dying out and all that is left
[30:49] sometimes is a blackness
[30:52] of spiritual blindness and ignorance
[30:56] within the house of god and within the
[31:00] true church of the living god
[31:03] oh but thank god for the love of god
[31:08] because that's what happens when we
[31:11] begin
[31:11] begin to lose the love of god
[31:15] because the love of god is love for god
[31:19] and love for his people love
[31:22] for his word and his ways oh my
[31:26] and when the church lose that lose the
[31:29] first love that god place within their
[31:31] heart
[31:32] everything begins to go wrong
[31:35] first john chapter 5 verse 3
[31:39] for this is the love of god that we
[31:43] keep his commandments let me read that
[31:46] again first john
[31:47] chapter 5 verse 3 for
[31:51] this is the love of god
[31:54] that we keep his commandments that we
[31:57] keep his
[31:58] word that we keep all of
[32:01] god's word and one deviation from that
[32:05] word
[32:06] one addition one subtraction my friends
[32:09] it changes the entire chemistry
[32:13] and composition of how god
[32:16] meant wanted his church to be
[32:20] amen hallelujah and then we go to church
[32:23] and people begin to shout begin to
[32:26] praise god
[32:28] and say that we love god
[32:31] and have a great emotional time and
[32:34] when it is over watch their walk
[32:38] watch their lives for action speak
[32:42] louder than words the day is past
[32:47] when you have to impress a deacon a
[32:50] pastor
[32:51] a teacher when you have to put on a
[32:55] pious act
[32:56] a religious drama of what you think
[33:00] a christian is in front of
[33:03] others that is now gone
[33:06] from us my friends but we should be
[33:10] walking in the word living in the word
[33:13] and having the word living in us and
[33:17] through us for his glory and for his
[33:20] honor
[33:21] amen yes sir we can say
[33:24] we love god and we have the love of god
[33:26] but our lives speak something else
[33:29] and actions as i've said speaks louder
[33:32] than words amen
[33:35] oh people of god oh people of god
[33:39] i hope you have not caught this ephesian
[33:42] spirit
[33:43] that would make you become relaxed
[33:47] and slowly begin to drift away
[33:50] far away oh from the
[33:54] original word of the living
[33:58] god for that falling away
[34:01] that relaxation my friends
[34:04] that drifting it begins so
[34:08] subtly that we can hardly feel it
[34:11] until we look back and realize
[34:15] that we are far from the shore let us
[34:18] then be
[34:19] up and careful friends with
[34:22] how we are living and what we are doing
[34:25] back to the world
[34:26] back to your prayer life back to your
[34:29] bible study
[34:30] back to studying the texts of the
[34:33] sermons and message
[34:35] of the word of god for this hour may the
[34:38] great holy spirit
[34:40] draw you back to your first love god
[34:43] says
[34:43] repent because i re you have left your
[34:46] first love the fire of god when you
[34:50] first received the
[34:51] message by revelation the desire the
[34:55] passion
[34:56] that god placed within that soul
[34:59] that god has within you oh praise god
[35:02] amen
[35:03] friends let's not open up the way for
[35:06] human reason to come in
[35:08] human understanding we have to have
[35:11] everything
[35:12] completely totally explained logically
[35:16] reasonably to us before we can believe
[35:19] oh praise god hallelujah lord of god
[35:23] let's go back friends back to pentecost
[35:27] i'm not talking about the modern
[35:29] pentecost back to acts 2
[35:32] 4 pentecost back to the original one
[35:35] that your apostles have if we cry out to
[35:38] god
[35:39] and say lord give me what those apostles
[35:42] have
[35:42] give me what paul had give me the
[35:45] revelation of the
[35:46] fellowship of the mystery that paul had
[35:50] i want that revelation i want that kind
[35:53] of
[35:53] a blessing upon my heart and in my life
[35:57] for the glory of god
[35:59] of course
[36:02] most folk even though i'm stan i'm
[36:04] speaking the word of god here
[36:06] tonight most people
[36:10] don't heed god's warning they don't take
[36:14] it
[36:14] seriously and sincerely
[36:19] the revival fire of god that was
[36:22] built up upon the sacred words
[36:27] of this day and of this hour
[36:31] the manifestation of the holy spirit
[36:34] that was experienced within the hearts
[36:38] of believers all
[36:42] blessed quietness the sacredness of the
[36:46] holy spirit
[36:48] moved upon the believers they would
[36:51] spend
[36:52] hours times in the presence of the
[36:55] living god
[36:56] but after a while the world creeps in
[36:59] busyness creeps in
[37:00] after a while fear creeps in and and
[37:04] then the devil begins to
[37:05] whisper within the hearts of the
[37:08] believer
[37:09] how can we protect this truth
[37:12] this revelation that we have received
[37:16] what can we do to see this message
[37:19] revival goes on and on
[37:23] and on and then
[37:27] the antichrist spirit comes in
[37:31] and whispers now look you've got the
[37:34] message
[37:34] you've got the truth you've got the
[37:36] revelation let's try
[37:38] our best to see that it doesn't get lost
[37:41] so therefore let's let's take it
[37:44] let's put it into into various systems
[37:48] and pathways and cans and let's make
[37:50] sure
[37:51] that we have it oh my friends organize
[37:54] let's let's even set up some sort of a
[37:58] standardized booklet of beliefs and
[38:02] fundamentals of what true
[38:06] believers ought to believe and rest
[38:09] their
[38:10] faith upon and then they
[38:13] begin to put it into church manuals
[38:16] and i won't be surprised if that doesn't
[38:20] start
[38:20] coming out uh soon
[38:24] if not there already amounts believers
[38:29] we stand for this we stand for that we
[38:31] believe this we believe that
[38:32] and we hold to this and and then
[38:36] put it like that and begin to have it in
[38:38] an
[38:39] organized form of beliefs
[38:43] and by doing that they add to the word
[38:48] and take away from the word and then
[38:52] the church dies just like eve died
[38:57] when she listened to satan's whisper in
[38:59] her ear
[39:00] and accepted his lie of his word
[39:05] for taking one wrong word
[39:08] will take you away from god and it's
[39:11] only
[39:12] god's word that brings life friends
[39:15] it's not what we say about the word
[39:19] but what god says about his
[39:23] own word for god is his own
[39:26] interpreter and he will
[39:29] make it plain may god help us
[39:33] may god not may we live lives that god
[39:36] will not be disappointed in us
[39:39] disappointed in his church but
[39:42] can god place his confidence
[39:46] in you may god bless you my friends
[39:50] may the holy spirit walk with you talk
[39:52] with you and go with you
[39:54] we'll come back again next week and
[39:57] we'll
[39:58] speak on another lesson in the seven
[40:00] church ages
[40:02] we want to touch on the topic of the
[40:05] warning of god
[40:06] god's warning to his people and
[40:10] let us go there my friends we want to
[40:13] talk about
[40:14] about god warning about the coming of
[40:17] those
[40:18] nicholasian believers
[40:23] and how they will come upon
[40:27] in the church and begin to dominate
[40:31] uncontrolled for god has already told us
[40:36] that if we don't listen to his word
[40:37] he'll take away his messenger
[40:41] and then he will begin to take away
[40:44] those faithful gospel shepherds that
[40:48] once were there we will be left with
[40:51] shepherds all right
[40:53] but you're left with shepherds that
[40:55] drift away from the word of god
[40:58] amen let's heed the warning of god let's
[41:02] heed the word of god
[41:03] let's heed the spirit of god and let
[41:08] let us not let the lamps go out
[41:11] and complete and total darkness descend
[41:15] but you shine your light in your corner
[41:18] and i'll do the same in mine may god
[41:21] bless you
[41:22] we'll meet again next wednesday
[41:26] when we will speak on the topic of
[41:29] nicolaitanism
[41:30] may god bless you real good
[41:36] [Music]
[42:07] you
