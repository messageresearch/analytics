[17:49] little study that we started couple of
[17:52] weeks ago amen and we're doing the woman
[17:55] in the Bible and we started out on Sarah
[17:58] and and we just want to
[18:01] continue on her she's one of the most
[18:05] significant wom in the Bible to
[18:09] me amen because she types
[18:13] you amen hallelujah and we just heard
[18:17] our pastor say said there that we
[18:21] expecting a change a body change and and
[18:26] God portrayed
[18:29] that change literally in
[18:32] Sarah
[18:33] amen so we know what God can do for you
[18:36] and I hallelujah praise the
[18:40] Lord praise
[18:42] God so we see I just want to recap a
[18:45] little bit just be seated for a little
[18:47] bit amen just want to recap briefly Amen
[18:51] to just jog your memory a little bit you
[18:54] know as we say repetition is the mother
[18:57] of learning amen you repeat certain
[19:00] things amen hallelujah it's like a
[19:02] record when you keep playing it playing
[19:04] it or you keep singing a song or uh
[19:08] repeating a scripture or it's get
[19:11] embedded in your
[19:13] soul amen hallelujah and that's uh a
[19:17] real teacher does that I can't say I'm a
[19:20] real teacher but a real teacher does
[19:22] that amen and God is our teacher amen
[19:27] amen and he led by example amen
[19:31] hallelujah so we saw through the last
[19:34] time
[19:36] amen God gave Abraham a
[19:40] promise amen an unconditional promise
[19:45] nothing attached it just God so chose
[19:49] Abraham amen by
[19:51] Grace by Grace amen and by Grace you are
[19:56] saved you are here by grace tonight so
[19:59] many billion people are in the world but
[20:03] God saved you and called you out in this
[20:06] same time thank you Lord amen just think
[20:09] of it of all maybe in Abraham's time so
[20:13] many right you think Abraham was a a
[20:17] religious person in the sense a Believer
[20:20] anyway like that no he
[20:21] wasn't amen but by Grace God chose
[20:27] Abraham and when God God chose a man
[20:30] amen he also as he he he he spoke to
[20:34] Abraham to leave his country and and
[20:37] depart he he also chose his wife with
[20:41] him amen
[20:43] hallelujah praise
[20:47] God and we see through faith as the
[20:51] scripture read here Sarah herself
[20:54] received strength to receive seed and
[20:57] was delivered of a child child when she
[20:59] was past age because she judged him
[21:03] faithful who made the
[21:06] promise amen
[21:09] hallelujah now you see L the god called
[21:12] Abraham to leave his country to separate
[21:15] himself from all
[21:18] unbelief amen from his family all the
[21:21] things that would hinder him amen what
[21:26] is hindering you tonight
[21:28] and God is calling for a total
[21:33] separation from unbelief from the things
[21:37] that will prevent you from fulfilling
[21:41] his promise in this end time amen amen
[21:46] hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus and we
[21:49] saw that how Abraham took his wife and
[21:54] lot his son's brother and all their
[21:57] substance and
[21:59] left his country and journeyed amen into
[22:02] a far country right but God said to
[22:05] Abraham I going to show you where I
[22:09] going to lead
[22:10] you man we have never been on this
[22:14] partway before this journey before but
[22:17] God is leading us and showing us and
[22:20] taking us to that promise that he has
[22:25] for us in this end time Amen brother
[22:27] amen abolutely what Pro what did God
[22:30] promise you in the same time amen
[22:34] hallelujah think about it praise
[22:39] God and you see when God called Abraham
[22:43] as we said he called for total
[22:45] separation separate yourself from your
[22:47] Kinsmen separate yourself from your
[22:50] father's house separate from all your
[22:54] Associates and inate yourself from all
[22:57] those things things that would keep you
[23:00] back and walk with
[23:04] me do you want to walk with the Lord
[23:07] today man do you want to follow friends
[23:11] do you want to follow the world because
[23:13] broad is the way that leads to
[23:17] destruction and many on that road
[23:20] many it's like a a a a a a a dead fish
[23:24] flowing down the stream but it takes a
[23:27] living fish to go
[23:30] Upstream to go against all the
[23:33] opposition and the tithes of this world
[23:37] that has been offering and coming
[23:40] against us think about the week you had
[23:43] all the challenges that you had thank
[23:46] God he made a way for you to be here
[23:48] tonight hallelujah amen you could have
[23:52] stayed home man so I going to listen on
[23:56] there but yes we we have to work we have
[23:59] to do things amen we're not a legalists
[24:03] amen hallelujah But as God would allow
[24:07] you to be here in his presence these
[24:10] Bible studies are just to encourage you
[24:14] to build up your faith you say okay
[24:16] again Bible study again our next service
[24:19] no it's for your own
[24:22] benefit there is something great that is
[24:26] happening Hallelujah
[24:29] when Abraham was walking through he was
[24:31] in a Wilderness he went to you know
[24:33] that's right man he went in a Wilderness
[24:36] Journey wasn't not a whole set of people
[24:40] around him and and everything like that
[24:43] to distract him amen
[24:47] hallelujah thank you Lord and this
[24:50] journey is a Wilderness Journey For Us
[24:53] amen
[24:55] hallelujah sometimes you feel that
[24:57] you're all alone but you're not
[24:59] alone God has promised that he will not
[25:02] leave you nor forsake you amen and when
[25:07] you're really down and out that is the
[25:10] time he comes on the scene when you
[25:12] think all hope is gone no end man the
[25:17] problems the situation that you're are
[25:18] facing it's all over no God is there to
[25:22] deliver you because he share his glory
[25:26] with no man he wants to receive the
[25:29] glory he wants to receive the praise
[25:32] what did he do for you this week
[25:34] hallelujah amen you see the god that we
[25:38] are serving is Alive and Well amen and
[25:41] you can trust him all the way not part
[25:44] of the way all the way all the way
[25:48] hallelujah praise God thank you
[25:51] Lord amen you see as they kept on
[25:56] moving God God reminded Abraham and
[26:01] Sarah of the promise that he made to
[26:04] them amen in Genesis 127 it says and the
[26:10] Lord appeared unto Abraham and said unto
[26:14] thy seed will I give this land just
[26:18] think of it so he's telling Abraham
[26:20] you're going to have
[26:22] children you're reminded him of the
[26:24] promise amen
[26:26] hallelujah and you see as they kept on
[26:29] moving as we said the last time a change
[26:33] already started to happen in their
[26:36] lives it was both physically amen and
[26:41] spiritually too because Abraham never
[26:45] staggered at the faith that God gave
[26:47] him amen hallelujah he never staggered
[26:51] he believe and trusted God that the
[26:54] promise that he made to him he's going
[26:56] to fulfill it
[26:59] hallelujah praise
[27:01] God thank you
[27:04] Lord
[27:08] hallelujah now we see that change
[27:11] actually literally happened because when
[27:13] they were went down to Egypt amen
[27:16] hallelujah a 60y old granny or or 75
[27:23] year old I 60 or 75 years she was granny
[27:28] they saw this woman as a beautiful young
[27:32] lady Amen in as so much the king wanted
[27:37] to take her as
[27:38] wife
[27:40] amen hallelujah just imagine that all
[27:44] the wrinkles started to disappear
[27:47] amen
[27:49] hallelujah the in the the chain started
[27:52] inside and it was expressing on the
[27:55] outside so when I st change start it in
[27:58] you in the inside it's got to be
[28:01] revealed or expressed on the outside
[28:03] that's right amen hallelujah the places
[28:06] that you used to go you're not you don't
[28:08] go them no more the things you used to
[28:10] say the songs you used to sing it's a
[28:13] new song you're singing now
[28:16] hallelujah praise
[28:19] God thank you Lord Jesus so we see the
[28:22] Egyptians said oh behold the woman that
[28:26] she was very fear
[28:29] she started to become beautiful and
[28:31] young again Amen in has so much amen the
[28:35] king wanted her as wife but you know God
[28:40] never
[28:41] promised amen someone else to have a
[28:47] child with Sarah he promised Abraham
[28:51] that's right amen hallelujah the promise
[28:55] is unto you
[28:58] men this change is for you make it
[29:03] personal tonight
[29:05] hallelujah thank you
[29:07] Lord you see God promised Abraham that
[29:11] Sarah would be a mother of
[29:16] Nations and that she would conceive and
[29:19] bear a son but you know as time passed
[29:23] by you know as most of us human beings
[29:27] you know we start
[29:29] to falter a little bit we start to get a
[29:33] little bit weak our faith start to
[29:35] diminish amen and you know something she
[29:39] said to Abraham
[29:42] amen you know I'm
[29:45] old God really didn't promise you know
[29:48] that I going to have a child maybe I
[29:51] going to help
[29:53] God you think you're going to help out
[29:56] God man she tried to intervene and help
[30:01] God bring the promise to pass as so many
[30:04] of us will want to do
[30:09] Hallelujah
[30:11] my you see now Sarah Abraham wives bear
[30:15] him no children children and she had a
[30:18] handmade an Egyptian whose name was
[30:22] hagga so he said why don't you take

[30:36] you don't try to work out God's way

[30:52] these countries coming against the
[30:56] promised Nation of
[30:59] Israel amen hallelujah thank you

[32:25] thinking amen
[32:28] when God created the heavens and this
[32:31] word and everything here what material
[32:34] did he
[32:36] use he just spoke things into
[32:40] existence
[32:41] amen so when he appeared he could have
[32:45] just called some elements man and form a
[32:48] body and just step right into
[32:50] it could he do that to you
[32:53] today man remember just be reminded
[32:58] God when he when the Lord was here on
[33:00] Earth he took something already that was
[33:04] created amen and multiplied it amen but
[33:09] in this day what did he
[33:12] take when he spoke squirrel into
[33:15] existence he took the spoken word amen
[33:19] hallelujah and that same spoken word is
[33:22] in you and I today yes sir so you can
[33:26] create things with the spoken word what

[34:01] day and he lifted up his eyes and looked
[34:05] and lo three men stood by him and when
[34:09] he saw them he ran to meet them from the
[34:12] tent door and bowed himself towards the
[34:16] ground and said my

[35:34] tent unto Sarah and said make ready
[35:38] quickly three measures of fine wheat
[35:40] meal need it make cakes upon the herd
[35:44] and Abraham ran unto the herd and

[47:09] amen as they say a good a good teacher
[47:12] takes his
[47:17] time a little bite at a time amen you

[47:26] last day for exam you want to study
[47:28] everything when you go in the exam room
[47:30] you forget everything because you're
[47:32] trying to pull out everything coming out
[47:34] one
[47:35] time have you experienced

[47:42] time a little at a time amen a little by
[47:46] here a little there a little am amen
[47:50] that's how we build
[47:51] fit praise God
[47:55] hallelujah so we want to take a look a
[47:58] little bit
[48:00] here that's Sarah's faith in God's
[48:05] promise
[48:06] right you see Sarah had been unable to
[48:10] have children for many years she decided
[48:14] to give her handmade hagga to her
[48:17] husband in order to obtain children by
[48:21] her this was not how God intended to
[48:27] give Abraham and Sarah and
[48:30] a but was a mistake which they had
[48:33] learned to more if they had learned to
[48:37] trust God more would have just you know
[48:41] abandoned that
[48:43] idea amen leave it up to God to do it
[48:47] because it's God who is going to make
[48:49] the promise come to pass amen
[48:53] hallelujah and as we see cause a whole
[48:56] set of trouble after
[48:57] that you see years past ishma grew up
[49:01] and had a relationship with his father
[49:03] and still Sarah remained childless amen
[49:08] finally when she was 90 years old as we
[49:11] have read God again promised her
[49:15] reminded her of the promise that he did
[49:18] right you see and at first she
[49:21] laughed
[49:23] amen now notice in verse 12 and in verse
[49:26] vers
[49:27] 13 therefore Sarah laughed within
[49:31] herself saying after I have grown old
[49:35] shall I have pleasure my Lord being old
[49:39] also and the Lord said to Abraham why
[49:42] did Sarah laugh saying
[49:45] surely I surely shall I surely be a
[49:50] child since I am old
[49:57] and as we have
[49:58] read is there anything too hard for the
[50:03] Lord to do if you go with one thing
[50:06] tonight go with just that one
[50:10] statement is anytime you come across any
[50:14] situation any challenge in your life ask
[50:17] yourself is there anything to hard the
[50:21] Lord to
[50:23] do man remind yourself over and
[50:27] anytime you come in keep
[50:29] thaten and you see how your Christian
[50:33] walk is going to
[50:36] Blossom amen
[50:40] hallelujah you see God is Not hindered
[50:43] by physical
[50:46] limitations
[50:48] right at the appointed time I will
[50:52] return to
[50:55] you amen amen you see he already said at
[50:58] the appointed time so God has
[51:03] appointments with you and
[51:05] I
[51:07] man it might not be the time that you
[51:09] thinking of man but he has there time
[51:14] yes he does Amen a specific time I going
[51:18] to be there at that time men an
[51:22] appointment with you and I but we are
[51:25] humans we kind of little bit
[51:28] impatient we are the the the
[51:32] super uh um instant kind of
[51:37] religion you want it right where right
[51:40] now instantaneous I ask for this I want
[51:43] it right now in the name of Jesus I want
[51:45] it now doesn't work so no ask for God's
[51:52] perfect will for
[51:55] yourself what is your perfect will Lord
[51:58] let thy perfect will be done amen
[52:02] hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[52:05] sometimes God is testing us to see if
[52:09] you got
[52:10] patience amen you say wait say wait I
[52:14] say wait upon the Lord
[52:17] hallelujah
[52:19] amen
[52:20] hallelujah amen
[52:28] and as we have read you see by
[52:31] faith Sarah
[52:33] herself also receives strength to
[52:38] conceive who gave her that
[52:41] strength almighty God
[52:44] himself where is your help come from
[52:47] where does your strength come
[52:49] from amen we need to be reminded of that
[52:53] it's not in
[52:55] ourself we could accomplish anything but
[52:57] it's by his grace by his strength by the
[53:01] knowledge by the wisdom by everything
[53:03] that he gives that we can acquire and
[53:05] get things done and accomplish in our
[53:07] lives hallelujah
[53:12] amen praise
[53:14] God thank you Lord
[53:16] Jesus now as we said last
[53:19] time Sarah
[53:24] amen is the only woman in the Bible
[53:28] whose name was changed by
[53:33] God Amen from Sarai to Sarah we have we
[53:39] have Jacob Amen to Israel we have um
[53:43] what's his name again
[53:45] um Saul to Paul and all those other ones
[53:50] right if you a good uh Bible
[53:54] student you remember all the the other
[53:56] ones amen hallelujah but she was the
[53:59] only
[54:00] woman that God changed her name from
[54:03] Sarai to
[54:05] Sarah amen and the meaning of Sarah
[54:10] means princess she was not only to be
[54:15] Abraham's
[54:17] princess but the princess of a large
[54:21] race of
[54:23] people amen sah was blessed by God to
[54:29] become a royal
[54:32] princess she would be a the mother of a
[54:35] Nation to come and she would also be a
[54:39] mother of kings of
[54:42] people but that's not the final
[54:45] one she was the royal
[54:50] lineage amen that David would come
[54:53] through Amen to produce this savior of
[54:57] the world yes sir amen
[55:00] hallelujah so just think of
[55:03] iten we had a great nation that came out
[55:07] of ishmail because God promised that he
[55:10] going to bless Abraham's seed and he
[55:13] couldn't hold withhold his promise is
[55:16] ishmael's seed
[55:18] blessed think of
[55:20] it amen when God makes a promise he
[55:23] makes it that's it amen so when God
[55:27] through Isaac amen God made that promise
[55:31] to him too amen he had to bless
[55:34] him hallelujah praise the
[55:39] Lord her ancestry and family
[55:42] life
[55:44] Abraham's Sarah was Abraham's half
[55:49] sister same father but different
[55:54] mother amen so when Abraham went down to
[55:58] Egypt and he told the people down in
[56:00] Egypt that's you know that's my
[56:03] sister it was a half
[56:06] liar amen but there nothing like a half
[56:09] lie a Lie Is A Lie man it a no black and
[56:14] white cow or black and white bird it's
[56:16] either it's black or it's either it's
[56:18] white man you know he was speaking 50%
[56:22] truth but it's still
[56:24] alive Hallelujah yeah
[56:27] amen praise
[56:30] God you see where did she
[56:33] live according to the scriptures she
[56:36] lived with Abraham in ear of the childes
[56:40] and that was an idolatry Nation they
[56:43] worship idols and God took Abraham out
[56:47] of that situation imagine an idol
[56:50] worshipper and placed his promise on
[56:53] that man amen won't we all Idol
[56:58] worshippers think of it anything that
[57:02] you placed in the front of the true and
[57:04] living God is your
[57:06] idol car house wife husband children Job
[57:12] movie stars this that to the money amen
[57:16] anything that you place before the
[57:18] almighty God that becomes your God and
[57:21] you become an idol worshiper to that
[57:25] amen hallelujah
[57:27] praise God now i' like to just do deal
[57:30] with a uh um a few little things here to
[57:33] bring it to your attention what was
[57:36] Sarah's
[57:39] weakness amen as we see in Genesis
[57:43] 162 amen she locked feet
[57:48] amen Sarah said unto Abraham behold now
[57:52] the Lord hath restrained me from bearing
[57:56] I pray thee go into unto my maid it may
[58:01] be that I may obtain children by her and
[58:05] Abraham hearkened to the voice of
[58:09] Sarah amen men so there we see her faith
[58:15] begins to
[58:18] waveren
[58:20] also she was a good schema or trickster
[58:24] she could have talked in Abraham into
[58:27] amen or persuaded Abraham into have a
[58:31] child by
[58:32] hagga
[58:34] amen
[58:36] hallelujah amen now we want to look a
[58:39] little bit of the strength of
[58:43] Sarah right as we see and we spoke a
[58:48] little bit before if someone your
[58:50] husband comes and tells you just take up

[1:16:15] sorry man make things right man don't
[1:16:19] don't they be blame shifting amen just
