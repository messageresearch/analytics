[19:11] of and emanates and permeates every
[19:15] single atom and molecule on this Earth
[19:18] and if you're connected to that and
[19:20] you're one with that and you're aware of
[19:23] that you become

[19:48] to get up tomorrow morning at like 4:30

[19:52] is important when you get over
[19:56] 50 praise God father we're so grateful
[20:00] tonight Lord that we can be here and be
[20:03] in your presence and allow your word to
[20:06] just come and have the preeminence oh
[20:08] God and just speak to our hearts and our
[20:10] lives give us what we need Lord tonight
[20:14] each and every one of us are at
[20:15] different uh places in our walk and Lord
[20:19] we're just trusting we're believing this
[20:23] message this call on our lives is not
[20:27] just some ordinary um thing we're not
[20:29] just church members but we are members
[20:32] of the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[20:35] you're a living God and you're in the
[20:37] midst of your people and if we're aware
[20:38] of that we can live Victorious and so
[20:42] tonight Lord as we approach your word we
[20:44] just ask your anointing to come bless
[20:47] your people Grant it we pray and bless
[20:50] those that are online that would listen
[20:52] in tonight Lord May the word have an
[20:55] effect on each and everyone in Jesus
[20:57] name amen praise God God bless you
[21:00] Saints let's read our scripture tonight
[21:03] A a very familiar scripture from The
[21:06] Book of
[21:07] Romans chapter 7 vers 14 for we know
[21:12] that the law is spiritual but I am
[21:16] carnal sold under sin for that which I
[21:20] do I allow not for that for what I would
[21:25] that do I
[21:26] not but what I hate that do
[21:31] I if then I do that which I would not I
[21:34] consent under unto the law that it is
[21:38] good now then it is no more I that doeth
[21:43] but sin that dwelleth in me so we need
[21:47] to realize that you know the
[21:49] fall back in the Garden of Eden allowed
[21:53] sin into our
[21:55] flesh and sin began to take control
[21:58] contr and became part of our
[22:01] characteristic as human beings and
[22:04] that's why the Bible says you're born in
[22:07] sin so until you recognize who you are
[22:11] in this flesh as a human you can't
[22:14] really
[22:16] overcome amen for
[22:18] now then it is no more I that do it but
[22:21] sin for I know that in me that is in my
[22:25] flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will
[22:29] is present with me but how to perform
[22:33] that which is good I find
[22:35] not for the good that I would I do not
[22:39] but the evil which I would not that I do
[22:43] now if I do that I would not it is no
[22:47] more I that doeth it but sin that
[22:51] dwelleth in me you see you got to
[22:55] understanding
[22:56] justification is very important
[22:58] important because the the the sin that
[23:02] that so easily besets you from time to
[23:05] time and the sin that you as you you
[23:07] know with your memory can look back and
[23:09] you can see the things that you did
[23:11] wrong all those things you need to
[23:13] realize that was not really you if
[23:16] you've truly been awakened in this hour
[23:19] I find then a law that when I would do
[23:22] good evil is present with me for I
[23:26] Delight in the law of God after the
[23:28] inward man but I see another law in my
[23:32] members Waring against the law of my
[23:36] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[23:39] the law of sin which is in my
[23:43] members oh Wretched Man that I am who
[23:47] shall deliver me from the body of this
[23:50] death I thank God through Jesus Christ
[23:54] Our Lord so then with the mind I myself
[23:59] serve the law of God but with the flesh
[24:02] the law of sin let us pray
[24:06] father add your blessings to the word
[24:08] now we pray in Jesus name you may be
[24:13] seated glory to God you know it's it's
[24:17] it's a paradox
[24:18] Saints it is a paradox that we have to
[24:22] um have this tremendous Revelation that
[24:25] God has given us when he when he when he
[24:27] woke us up out of our
[24:29] Amnesia he woke up the attribute that
[24:33] was in us that he placed within our
[24:36] hearts but that attribute like the like
[24:39] the scripture says uh the the the carnal
[24:42] mind is at emnity with God because you
[24:47] know there there's there's there's a
[24:48] Waring constantly within us to
[24:52] overcome and you know the devil loves to
[24:55] just you know hit us over the head with
[24:58] all of our past you know memories and
[25:01] past sin that he wants to you know he
[25:03] wants to apply it to to to us but
[25:07] knowing who we are as attributes of God
[25:11] you should be able to resist the devil
[25:14] by Revelation and tell him that was not
[25:19] me you were deceiving this flesh because
[25:23] it says very clearly that it is that
[25:27] that for I know that in me that is in my
[25:29] flesh dwelleth no good thing there was
[25:32] nothing good in your human nature and
[25:36] your human
[25:37] ability it was all carnality it was all
[25:41] man it was all you thinking that that
[25:43] you could do things that you could
[25:45] overcome that you you know that with
[25:47] your own ability you could serve God you
[25:51] can't serve god with your own ability
[25:54] you can only serve God by faith amen
[25:58] amen praise God and you know I want to
[26:01] look at a scripture here back in the Old
[26:05] Testament um let's go to the next
[26:07] scripture it's from numbers
[26:10] 13:30 listen careful Caleb stilled the
[26:13] people before Moses and said let us go
[26:17] up at
[26:19] once and possess it for we are well able
[26:23] to overcome it amen and that's what we
[26:28] want to talk about that's what we want
[26:29] to look at if we want to live a
[26:32] Victorious Life In Christ then we need
[26:36] to know that we need to
[26:39] overcome that we are
[26:42] Overcomers Hallelujah listen to brother
[26:45] Bram here he
[26:46] says or wait before we go to that the
[26:49] Greek word Nik is translated as
[26:56] Overcomer conqueror
[26:58] or Victor and we know from the seven
[27:01] Church ages the
[27:02] nians they were conquering Christ they
[27:06] were trying to conquer the word when the
[27:08] Holy Spirit would get into the church
[27:11] and the people would come under the
[27:13] leadership of God and the anointing of
[27:15] the Holy Spirit the enemy would try to
[27:18] conquer the
[27:19] church well it's now the other way
[27:22] around we're going to conquer the
[27:25] enemy because if you go on the verb
[27:28] means to have
[27:31] Victory we are victorious and we have
[27:35] Victory and the Victory is Christ in you
[27:39] amen that's where the victory lies to
[27:42] have superiority you can't have
[27:45] superiority over the things of this
[27:47] world or the enemy of this world the God
[27:51] of this evil age is more smarter more
[27:55] powerful he's had thousand thousands of
[27:58] years of dealing with human beings
[28:02] tricking human beings trapping human
[28:05] beings and that's why that the Bible
[28:08] says all in the in the end time in the
[28:12] last days all would be deceived except
[28:17] those whose names were written in the
[28:19] Lamb's Book of Life thanes so there's a
[28:23] people that cannot be deceived and it's
[28:27] it's because they're Overcomers and it's
[28:30] because the Overcomer lives in
[28:33] them it also means to
[28:36] defeat an
[28:38] enemy and when you overcome the little
[28:41] things in your life you're defeating an
[28:45] enemy it's War Warfare is is you know
[28:50] one little bit of ground at a time you
[28:53] know when when you go back and you you
[28:55] research War you know uh Hitler wanted
[28:59] to conquer all the nations and the way
[29:01] that he would do it he would go to one
[29:03] you know border and then he would
[29:05] conquer that border and then he'd go to
[29:07] the next one and he would conquer the
[29:08] next one well it's the same thing for
[29:11] you the enemy works that way trying to
[29:14] conquer your lives by starting with
[29:16] little things that's why the little
[29:18] foxes that spoil the vine you got to be
[29:20] aware of the things that that you're
[29:22] letting into your life he'll he'll work
[29:25] on you little by little until he's
[29:26] finally got you
[29:29] but the Holy Spirit also in you is an
[29:32] overcomer and little by little you'll
[29:35] overcome
[29:37] this that is your greatest enemy listen
[29:40] to brother brandham here he says next
[29:42] slide you know Israel started out and I
[29:45] could say the same thing and bring it in
[29:48] here brother Bram says they started out
[29:51] two million strong and ended up with two
[29:56] men right they saw the works of God they
[29:59] saw the manifestation of the spirit they
[30:02] saw Great Mighty Miracles being done
[30:05] there in Egypt and everything and
[30:07] started out but it wasn't in their heart
[30:12] they didn't overcome a lot of people
[30:16] they they Christ calls them you know and
[30:19] they they have that honeymoon stage
[30:21] where they come to the Lord and you know
[30:23] they'll join a church and you know
[30:25] they'll get uh you know excited about
[30:28] the things that they're hearing but then
[30:30] they they they need to realize that they
[30:32] need to overcome now in order to truly
[30:35] have victory in their walk with God
[30:39] because the enemy is not going to let
[30:40] you go that easy he is not going to let
[30:43] you just join the church and just
[30:45] immediately walk right in and start
[30:48] disrupting his kingdom no
[30:51] sir you got to overcome they just come
[30:55] out and Jesus said and they perished in
[30:59] the wilderness and are eternally
[31:02] dead every one of them is dead that
[31:06] means Eternal
[31:08] separation having no more the ability to
[31:13] be in the presence of God that's what it
[31:16] means to die and to be
[31:20] dead in this
[31:23] understanding every one of them is dead
[31:26] that means Eternal separation every one
[31:28] of them rotted in the wilderness but
[31:31] there was two men Joshua and Caleb and
[31:35] when it come to The
[31:37] Showdown the obstacles was so great till
[31:40] they looked like grasshoppers side of
[31:43] them Joshua screamed out with Caleb and
[31:45] said we are more than able to do it why
[31:51] God said so see until you get to a place
[31:55] where you believe what God said about
[31:57] you yes well God said about your ability
[32:00] to overcome that you are more than a
[32:04] conqueror until you come to that place
[32:06] where you've got confidence in the word
[32:09] of God and you've you've taken God at
[32:11] his word you're not looking at
[32:14] circumstance anymore they looked at
[32:17] those at those giants that were in there
[32:19] and they many of them their hearts
[32:22] melted because they figured there's just
[32:24] no way I can overcome and you might have
[32:27] situations
[32:28] in your life and you might think there's
[32:30] just no way that I can overcome
[32:37] this but don't rely on your
[32:41] ability
[32:44] amen we are more than able to do it why
[32:47] God said so and there and they were
[32:49] Overcomers they
[32:51] overcome they was the ones that was
[32:54] privileged out of the whole great
[32:56] organization of people people to take
[32:59] the real elected bride into the promised
[33:03] land and God has a people in this hour
[33:07] that have
[33:09] recognized that there is a true promise
[33:12] in the word of God and that promise is
[33:15] the rapture of the body of Jesus
[33:18] Christ and there are individuals that
[33:21] have been anointed by the word of God
[33:23] that have received the word of God that
[33:25] believe the word of God that don't look
[33:28] at circumstances anymore they're not
[33:30] looking at the Giants out there big
[33:33] churches big organizations like we were
[33:35] saying on Sunday I got a church you know
[33:37] people got churches with 20,000 30,000
[33:41] 40,000 but yet they have not overcome to
[33:46] believe God's word all of
[33:51] it because it's the word that's going to
[33:54] overcome it's not going to be you that
[33:56] overcomes but it'll be you recognizing
[33:59] that the word is in you and has already
[34:03] overcome what an hour Saints glory to
[34:06] God the bride into the pro Joshua and
[34:09] Caleb in the front lines out there as
[34:11] the two generals amen LED them right
[34:14] down to the river and cross the river
[34:16] over into the promised land why they
[34:19] believed the
[34:21] word no matter what from the message how
[34:26] can I overcome come praise God let's
[34:30] look at the next scripture Jesus used
[34:32] the word in John
[34:34] 16:33 where he said I have overcome the
[34:39] world you believe that amen glory to God
[34:43] why do you think he had to come here why
[34:46] do you think that he had to become that
[34:48] the word had to become flesh the word
[34:53] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us you
[34:56] know we always talk about it but people
[34:59] don't realize it's only through Jesus
[35:02] Christ that true salvation can be
[35:05] achieved because there's no way that
[35:08] human beings can overcome this
[35:11] world that's why they're going into
[35:14] Great Tribulation and that's why the the
[35:16] the prophecies that are written about
[35:18] the world and the end time and what is
[35:21] next to come you know the Bible has a
[35:23] 7,000 year plan did you know that the
[35:27] Bible has 4,000 years before Christ and
[35:33] 3,000 years after
[35:36] Christ
[35:38] 2,000 have already gone by and the last
[35:42] Thousand Years according to the Bible
[35:46] for this Earth is the Millennium and
[35:49] it's 1,000 years of
[35:53] Peace there'll be no more overcoming
[35:56] then not for the Sons and Daughters of
[35:59] God no sir they will rule and reign with
[36:04] Christ in that new government there'll
[36:08] be no more overcoming but he had to
[36:11] come as the wave sheath as the Overcomer
[36:15] so that he could give up his Spirit to
[36:18] come into us so that we could
[36:22] overcome amen that's why he said and he
[36:25] made it plain to them to to the
[36:27] disciples and to the to the world then I
[36:31] have overcome the
[36:33] world this
[36:35] Dimension this Plan of
[36:38] Redemption this plan that I have to
[36:41] redeem my own he's come to take back
[36:45] what was rightfully his from before the
[36:48] foundations of this
[36:50] world Amen and he made it clear that
[36:53] listen I've overcome the
[36:55] world you don't have to worry about
[36:57] World War I World War II or World War I
[37:01] that's coming I've overcome it but you
[37:04] need to be in
[37:06] me you need to know that you are my
[37:09] people and that I am your God go to the
[37:13] next
[37:14] slide in short he meant I have conquered
[37:19] Satan's
[37:21] system because remember Satan's got a
[37:23] plan
[37:25] too God allowed him to have that plan
[37:28] because it's all part of the Redemption
[37:31] it's all part of being a savior how can
[37:34] you be a savior if there's nothing to
[37:37] save how can you be a father if you
[37:40] don't have children you see God wanted
[37:43] to express himself and he wanted to be a
[37:47] conqueror he wanted to be a savior and
[37:51] the only way he could do that was to
[37:53] know the end from the beginning and
[37:56] place individuals here on the earth on
[37:59] free moral agency and give them the
[38:02] ability to accept
[38:05] him that's the only thing that is
[38:09] required you must accept when he reveals
[38:13] himself to
[38:15] you you can't
[38:17] reject go on Revelations 1:18 I am he
[38:21] that liveth and was dead and behold I am
[38:25] alive forever more amen and have the
[38:29] keys of hell and of death see he was he
[38:32] was making it very plain here that he
[38:35] was the one that came to
[38:38] conquer I got the keys he says Satan
[38:42] doesn't have the keys you don't have to
[38:44] fear death the enemy can't death can't
[38:48] take you that's why Paul said death
[38:51] where's your sting death has no sting to
[38:54] a son or a daughter of God because the
[38:57] con conqueror lives in them the one who
[38:59] overcame the world the one who came to
[39:02] to conquer Satan's system now lives in
[39:10] you we are partakers of his
[39:13] victory the Christian next Slide the
[39:17] Christian as a member of the body of
[39:19] Christ is a partaker of his
[39:24] victory we need to realize
[39:28] the the the awesomeness of these
[39:31] truths we are partakers of his victory
[39:35] it's not your Victory don't be looking
[39:37] for you to be the great Victor he's the
[39:41] one that gives you Victory amen next a
[39:44] Christian partakes of everything that
[39:46] Christ is and has including his
[39:51] righteousness you want to put on
[39:53] righteous people want to oh I'm more
[39:55] righteous than you I I go to church more
[39:57] I pray more I do it's not by
[40:01] works it's not by your own righteousness
[40:04] I give more I I I do more good I I go
[40:08] onto the street and I I I preach to the
[40:11] poor and I go three days a week four
[40:13] days a week listen those are great
[40:16] things but it's not based on your own
[40:19] righteousness it's his righteousness his
[40:23] death it was his death that gave you
[40:27] life
[40:27] am it's not you dying that's going to
[40:30] give you life it's his death in you
[40:34] gives you eternal life amen it was his
[40:38] resurrection it wasn't Muhammad raising
[40:41] from a cave on a white horse it was
[40:44] Jesus Christ raising from the dead amen
[40:48] after three days exactly the way he said
[40:52] he was going to do it he's the only one
[40:55] that proved his word and people have a
[40:58] driver's license a birth certificate
[41:00] that proves that Jesus Christ was here
[41:03] on this
[41:05] Earth his Spirit his divine nature and
[41:09] his inheritance is what we
[41:13] gain go on since Christ is a Victor
[41:18] Christians partake of his victory the
[41:21] believer then is a Victor all that was
[41:24] in Christ he poured upon the church
[41:27] church so his victory his overcoming
[41:30] ability his spirit all the things that
[41:33] he conquered he pour it into you so that
[41:37] you could realize and recognize that you
[41:39] are now more than a
[41:43] conqueror those who have been born of
[41:46] God are true
[41:48] Overcomers but you got to be born let's
[41:51] look at some scriptures on overcoming
[41:54] Romans 8:37
[41:57] nay in all these things we are more than
[42:02] conquerors there it is Allelujah aren't
[42:05] you happy aren't you glad that you are
[42:08] actually more than conquerors but how
[42:11] through
[42:13] him why because he loved us amen because
[42:16] he loves you amen praise God hallelujah
[42:20] next scripture 1 Corinthians 15:57 says
[42:23] but thanks be to God who gives us the
[42:27] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[42:31] hallelujah praise God Amen and the next
[42:35] one says in Romans 81 there is therefore
[42:38] now no
[42:40] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[42:43] if you're in Christ that devil can't
[42:46] condemn you
[42:48] anymore he can bring up your past he can
[42:50] bring up your mistakes he can he can
[42:53] show them to you and and you actually
[42:55] really did those things
[42:58] but it wasn't you it was the it was the
[43:02] sin that dwell in your
[43:05] flesh you were you you were unaware that
[43:08] God was a part of your life you were
[43:10] just subject to this this carnal uh uh
[43:14] realm here and and and you were governed
[43:16] by your emotions you were governed by
[43:18] the lust of the flesh you were governed
[43:20] by the pride of life you were governed
[43:23] by the by the uh uh all the unbeliever
[43:27] belief that that you were brought up you
[43:29] know around people people know listen
[43:32] there's a lot of generational things
[43:36] that were in your life surrounded your
[43:38] life could have been in your parents in
[43:40] your grandparents in your great
[43:43] grandparents it's totally irrelevant now
[43:48] you need to come to a place this bride
[43:51] is coming into a level of maturity where
[43:53] she realizes who she is amen that she is
[43:58] not of this world we're in the world but
[44:01] we're not of the world we are attributes
[44:06] of God we are actually a part of God
[44:09] that has already overcome this world and
[44:12] you've come out of your Amnesia you've
[44:14] come out of that sleep state where where
[44:17] you're you're constantly under control
[44:20] of the things of this where we who walk
[44:22] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[44:27] we're listening for the Holy Spirit to
[44:29] speak to us here
[44:32] tonight it's a Bible study we're looking
[44:35] at a lot of scripture but I I trust that
[44:37] these scriptures in some area of your
[44:39] life one of them will will strike you
[44:41] and wake you up you know you could have
[44:43] read these scriptures a thousand times
[44:47] but if God wants to speak to you about
[44:49] one particular situation where the enemy
[44:52] has got you bound up got you chained up
[44:55] under the circumstances of of of your
[44:58] flesh and constantly holding you in a
[45:01] state of condemnation you can be set
[45:03] free tonight by resisting the enemy amen
[45:06] praise God let's go on expectations from
[45:10] a
[45:11] Believer we're called
[45:15] Christians why because we're
[45:18] Christlike we have Christ in our lives
[45:22] we live for Christ now we don't live for
[45:25] the world anymore we live for Christ
[45:27] Christ who is the
[45:29] word we are called children of light
[45:31] Ephesians 5:8 and Children of the day 1
[45:36] Thessalonians
[45:38] 55 we've been brought from the
[45:42] darkness of this world of the traditions
[45:46] of man of the teachings of man into the
[45:50] Glorious light of the liberty of Christ
[45:54] Jesus the word revealed
[45:57] to you
[45:58] personally
[46:00] amen we are called the children of
[46:05] obedience you
[46:07] know a lot of people want to hang on to
[46:11] a stubborn Spirit of rebellion it's just
[46:15] a spirit of disobedience is what it is
[46:18] remember that Spirit of Disobedience it
[46:21] started right back in the Garden of
[46:24] Eden and it's a part of of the nature of
[46:27] this
[46:28] flesh but the word says that we are
[46:30] called children of
[46:33] obedience why because obedience to the
[46:36] word of God because Christ obeyed and
[46:40] did all that the father had shown him
[46:43] and because of his obedience now we
[46:46] become the children of obedience because
[46:49] we are Sons and Daughters of God by
[46:52] accepting Christ as our
[46:55] absolute do you see like you you know
[46:57] like when when when
[46:59] Disobedience uh tries to control you
[47:03] replace it by saying that Christ obeyed
[47:07] you know there's scripture that says
[47:08] that that he had to come under
[47:11] obedience in order for him to
[47:14] overcome this world Imagine God having
[47:17] to come under obedience because he knew
[47:20] that you would have to be in this human
[47:23] flesh and so he had to overcome and
[47:26] become obedient in
[47:28] flesh so that when the Revelation comes
[47:31] to you and you're in flesh you can
[47:35] understand that you can now be children
[47:37] of obedience and not Disobedience
[47:39] because he
[47:41] overcame
[47:44] thank we are also called the children of
[47:48] God now if you're a child of
[47:51] God then you're actually a mini God
[47:57] don't get me wrong here don't don't oh
[47:59] I'm
[48:01] God by maturity and by Revelation you'll
[48:05] come to recognize that you are a part of
[48:08] God that you are expressed part of God
[48:13] he expressed you in the form of an
[48:15] attribute but that attribute is
[48:19] God that's why he said on that day ye
[48:22] shall know that I am in the father ye in
[48:24] me and I in you he was talking talking
[48:27] about this body of Christ that we are a
[48:31] part of that gives us the ability to say
[48:35] that we are children of
[48:39] God a child of
[48:42] God walks with
[48:44] power walks with
[48:46] authority let's move on I don't want to
[48:48] get ahead of myself but most of all we
[48:51] are called in the title of Overcomers
[48:57] we are called in the title of Overcomers
[48:59] 1 John 5:4 says whatever is born of God
[49:04] overcometh the
[49:07] world there's a promise right there in
[49:09] the word of God whatever is born of
[49:14] God overcometh the world and this is the
[49:17] victory that overcometh the
[49:20] world our
[49:22] Revelation that we are
[49:25] Overcomers our re Revelation that we are
[49:28] children of God our
[49:31] Revelation that greater is he that is in
[49:34] me than he that is in the world having a
[49:38] revelation of that gives us the ability
[49:41] to overcome any
[49:44] circumstance
[49:46] whatsoever but you must be born of
[49:51] god let's go on the way to be an
[49:54] overcomer Jesus says here in John 3 3 he
[49:57] says Jesus answered and said unto him
[49:59] verily verily I say unto thee except a
[50:03] man be born again he cannot even see the
[50:08] kingdom of God so here now we need to
[50:11] realize you know a lot of people you
[50:14] know uh talk about Christ and they they
[50:16] they mention being born again what is it
[50:19] to be born again literally your old
[50:24] life dies
[50:27] Y when you go into that water and you're
[50:31] buried in that water your old life
[50:34] literally gets left
[50:36] behind you need to have a revelation on
[50:39] that baptism a lot of people go in a wet
[50:43] a dry Sinner and they come out a wet
[50:45] sinner because they have not accepted
[50:48] the spirit of the word of God and have
[50:52] truly had the new birth which is the
[50:55] Awakening it's not that you all of a
[50:58] sudden you you you come to an altar call
[51:00] and and and you oh I went to The Altar
[51:03] and I gave my life to Jesus Christ and
[51:05] now I'm born again no the true birth is
[51:10] that you come to realize that you were
[51:12] always a son or a daughter of
[51:15] God and that you were in a state of
[51:18] total Amnesia not knowing who you were
[51:22] you thought you were born into this
[51:23] world you were told that when you get
[51:26] old you're going to die you're going to
[51:27] be buried six feet under and then if you
[51:30] were brought up in Catholic then they
[51:31] were told you go to a Purgatory if
[51:34] you're you know a Buddhist then you
[51:36] become a part of nature or some animal
[51:39] or or if you're a Hindu or whatever all
[51:42] these different teachings or if you're a
[51:44] Muslim you go and you get 21 new wives
[51:47] all kinds of
[51:50] rubbish the true birth allows you to
[51:54] recognize and bring you back to the word
[51:57] of God Amen and it gives you the ability
[52:01] to see the
[52:02] kingdom to see the Plan of Redemption to
[52:06] see what it is that you are actually
[52:08] going to be saved from and what it is
[52:11] that that that has a hold on your life
[52:13] right now that you've been that you're
[52:15] being set free from and that you you're
[52:18] now open to the understanding of the
[52:20] true kingdom of God but it requires you
[52:23] to submit to the word of God next slide
[52:27] says in James 47 and 8 it says submit
[52:30] yourselves
[52:32] therefore to the
[52:35] word you've got to believe God's
[52:38] word you've got to submit to the word
[52:41] and you've got to resist
[52:43] evil because when you resist it flees
[52:47] from
[52:47] you we're told that all we need to do is
[52:51] resist the
[52:53] enemy it's not an easy thing to resist
[52:55] the enemy
[52:57] you know a lot of people think that the
[52:58] enemy is just you know a person out
[53:02] there or some system out
[53:06] there sometimes you'll be talking to one
[53:08] of your own brothers and sisters and
[53:10] that enemy will pop right
[53:12] up and speak through your brother or
[53:15] your
[53:19] sister and you don't want to resist you
[53:21] want to
[53:23] fight because
[53:26] pride is a devil and it takes a hold of
[53:30] you and all of a sudden you got to prove
[53:32] that you're right and that he's wrong or
[53:35] she's right and you're
[53:38] wrong you see all these
[53:41] things where we have to resist sometimes
[53:44] we we think that it's resisting oh I'm
[53:46] going to resist that system there I'm
[53:48] not going to go to that church I'm not
[53:50] going to go into those places where
[53:52] where the enemy is you know uh they got
[53:54] all kinds of you know
[53:57] uh metal music and satanic worship and
[54:01] all those things and meanwhile you
[54:03] you're right in church and you can't
[54:05] even resist when when the enemy comes
[54:08] and sits right there with you with your
[54:10] brother or your sister in the midst of a
[54:12] fellowship and you've got to you've got
[54:14] to pop off and show that you
[54:17] know you can't resist the enemy that's
[54:21] when you need to be quiet you need to be
[54:23] still you need to allow the Holy Ghost
[54:27] to deliver you and to deliver
[54:33] them next slide draw nigh to God and He
[54:37] will draw nigh unto
[54:40] you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and
[54:43] purify your hearts you
[54:46] double-minded you
[54:48] know here he is he's talking about
[54:51] submitting to God resisting the enemy
[54:54] and he gets into the little nitty pritty
[54:56] things about cleaning your hands you
[54:59] know doing certain things that you know
[55:02] you shouldn't be
[55:03] doing purifying your hearts
[55:07] keeping
[55:09] unforgiveness what a devil that
[55:12] is that is one terrible demon from the
[55:15] pits of hell and it and it it it holds
[55:20] more Sons and Daughters of God than
[55:23] anything else did you know that oh they
[55:26] did did this to
[55:27] me when did they do that 20 years
[55:31] ago 20 years
[55:34] ago my God and you wonder 20 years later
[55:38] and that thing is still in your
[55:41] heart that's a dangerous thing you see
[55:46] overcoming and drawing near to God
[55:49] requires us to purify our hearts and
[55:52] know
[55:53] remember that flesh did that thing
[55:57] it wasn't the attribute of God because
[56:00] the attribute of God could never ever
[56:04] come against itself no it couldn't do it
[56:08] it could never come and strike
[56:11] itself how can the kingdom of God strike
[56:15] itself no the enemy the devil will
[56:17] strike other
[56:20] Devils to bring war and to bring
[56:22] confusion and to bring uh enity
[56:26] but no way attributes of God can hold on
[56:30] to unforgiveness and allow it to sit
[56:33] there in their heart when when the word
[56:35] of God says you need to purify your
[56:38] heart because you're double-minded and
[56:41] you don't know it you show yourself one
[56:44] way but yet you don't trust God in this
[56:48] area I know this flesh will be sticky I
[56:52] know that it's hard to trust the Flesh
[56:54] and you can't trust the flesh
[56:57] it's one of the things that that that
[56:58] you know it's that emnity with God
[57:00] remember that part of the flesh is your
[57:02] carnal mind remember that okay your
[57:06] carnal mind is going to tell you no no
[57:08] this actually happened they did this or
[57:11] he did that or she did this yes but that
[57:16] doesn't put you in that should never put
[57:19] you in a place where you are now in that
[57:22] condition where your heart is not pure
[57:25] and your mind is is not settled you
[57:28] should be able to
[57:30] forgive and forget amen that's the way
[57:33] God forgives he forgives he forgets he
[57:37] doesn't bring it up anymore never brings
[57:39] it up never brings it up never brings it
[57:41] up but when the enemy Rises up which he
[57:44] will try to rise up again what are you
[57:47] going to do resist you're going to
[57:50] resist it you're not going to Bow into
[57:52] it you're not going to talk about it
[57:54] you're not going to you're not going to
[57:55] elabor at on it you're not going to
[57:57] express it because the minute the enemy
[57:59] sees you in that condition he says I
[58:02] still got
[58:06] them you see the kind of things you can
[58:08] draw of the word of
[58:11] God submission to God to submit next
[58:14] slide means to yield to draw near
[58:18] acknowledge or Surrender oneself to the
[58:22] will and authority of God do you do you
[58:25] not believe that God has the authority
[58:28] and the ability to deal with whatever
[58:32] circumstance you might
[58:35] think is too hard for you it's too hard
[58:39] you can't you can't forgive
[58:41] it you're having a hard time forgiving
[58:44] it but it's because you haven't fully
[58:47] submitted to his authority and his
[58:50] ability to do
[58:51] it and it keeps you in a in a defeated
[58:55] condition and Satan just looks at you
[58:56] and says still got
[58:59] him and you can't go any further when
[59:02] you're in that kind of a
[59:05] condition you're just stuck right there
[59:07] and you're wondering why you're feeling
[59:09] you know that that you're not just
[59:11] completely free and you know but when
[59:14] when you when Jesus said he that's heavy
[59:17] laden come unto me I'll give you rest
[59:21] you know what like you know you know how
[59:23] it is to have a really good rest you
[59:25] know when you when you've really like oh
[59:27] this feels so good you're just falling
[59:30] into that beautiful rest and it just
[59:31] feels so good you know well that's what
[59:35] he wants you to experience with
[59:37] him he wants you to have that rest where
[59:40] you're at peace where your your your
[59:42] your
[59:43] joy you know the joy of the Lord now
[59:47] becomes your strength imagine that if
[59:50] you've been feeling weak and you're one
[59:53] my God I'm feeling so weak I'm tired all
[59:55] the time time because you need more joy
[59:59] in your life you need more joy in your
[1:00:02] walk you know you need to you need to
[1:00:04] laugh more you need to you know uh you
[1:00:07] know encourage one another with with

[1:00:18] you've got joy in the Lord You' be able
[1:00:21] to sing that song the joy of the Lord is
[1:00:24] my strength amen and all of a sudden
[1:00:27] you're going to have a different walk
[1:00:28] you're going to have a a little bit more
[1:00:30] of a leap and a and a little bit more
[1:00:32] bounce in your walk with God and with
[1:00:35] your brothers and your sisters and the
[1:00:38] community of
[1:00:43] God we are called Next we are called to
[1:00:46] submit ourselves to God in all areas of
[1:00:50] Our Lives listen carefully
[1:00:53] now spiritually
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:57] mentally
[1:00:59] physically socially and financially amen
[1:01:04] all areas of Our Lives some people
[1:01:08] they'll they'll do fine with the with
[1:01:10] the spirituality but you know when it
[1:01:13] comes to socially they can't get along
[1:01:16] with other
[1:01:19] people stubborn Spirits stubborn you
[1:01:23] know just or you you know physically and
[1:01:27] and and you know they're great
[1:01:29] physically but then they're
[1:01:32] stingy cuz they can't let go and and
[1:01:35] allow God to just flow through their
[1:01:38] lives
[1:01:39] financially Financial blessing of the
[1:01:42] Lord it flows amen through you the
[1:01:46] scripture says he he will not muzzle the
[1:01:50] O the ox that threshes out the corn
[1:01:54] think about that so if you're if you're
[1:01:57] a
[1:01:59] giver you want to be a better Giver amen
[1:02:03] a greater Giver because God's not GNA
[1:02:06] he's not going to stop that he's not
[1:02:08] gonna if he sees that you're doing he's
[1:02:09] G boy I can flow a lot more through that
[1:02:12] one there Hallelujah he doesn't hold on
[1:02:14] to any of it he just lets it Go and God
[1:02:17] provides your needs gives you more than
[1:02:20] enough does things supernaturally in
[1:02:23] your life he just drops blessings on you
[1:02:26] out of nowhere all of a sudden a
[1:02:27] blessing comes your way you didn't even
[1:02:29] know where it came
[1:02:31] from Uncle who left me how
[1:02:37] much hallelujah praise
[1:02:40] God he can flow through you if you allow
[1:02:44] him to flow through you amen but you got
[1:02:47] to know that he is the provider he's The
[1:02:51] Giver hallelujah praise God so all of
[1:02:55] these areas mentally we want to we want
[1:02:57] to mentally give ourselves and submit
[1:03:00] ourselves in every area of Our Lives
[1:03:03] let's let's go to the next in uh he also
[1:03:06] wants us we're going to five more
[1:03:07] minutes and then we're going to continue
[1:03:09] next
[1:03:10] time uh 1 John 1 18-10 he says if we say
[1:03:15] that we have no sin we deceive ourselves
[1:03:18] and the truth is not in
[1:03:21] us this is what I mean by understanding
[1:03:25] who you are as a human being until you
[1:03:28] come to realize that you're born in sin
[1:03:31] shaped in iniquity speaking lies a lot
[1:03:34] of people oh I never did anything bad I
[1:03:36] don't I you know I I I I i' I'm
[1:03:40] good there's none good amen nobody
[1:03:44] nobody's
[1:03:45] good the only one that's good is God
[1:03:49] Amen and if you've got God in you that's
[1:03:53] good Hallelujah praise God he says here
[1:03:59] and if we confess our sins he is
[1:04:02] faithful and just to forgive us do you
[1:04:05] see how important it is to confess your
[1:04:08] sins in other words you know like
[1:04:11] sometimes you got to go and and and you
[1:04:13] got to make things right with your
[1:04:14] brother or
[1:04:16] sister sometimes God will show you when
[1:04:18] it comes to confessing certain
[1:04:21] situations because of something you may
[1:04:23] have done against a brother or sister
[1:04:26] and you will no matter what that thing
[1:04:29] will kind of linger until you make it
[1:04:32] right and you just got to clear it and
[1:04:34] confess it and say you know what I want
[1:04:37] this thing gone I don't want it coming
[1:04:39] up anymore if you notice it coming up
[1:04:41] it's because it's still a little bit
[1:04:45] unconfessed okay and so we need to we
[1:04:48] need to uh confess our sins before God
[1:04:51] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[1:04:54] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:04:58] unrighteousness there are things that we
[1:05:00] do that are not righteous but if we
[1:05:03] confess it and we go to God and we say
[1:05:05] Lord I don't want this thing anymore you
[1:05:07] know I I I don't want it controlling my
[1:05:10] emotions controlling my thoughts I Want
[1:05:12] to Be Free he is
[1:05:15] faithful he's
[1:05:18] faithful amen and if we say that we have
[1:05:21] not sinned we make him a
[1:05:24] liar and his word is not in US think
[1:05:29] about
[1:05:31] that people want to say oh I never did
[1:05:33] anything
[1:05:34] wrong I sin every
[1:05:38] day it happens it's it's constant we're
[1:05:41] being bombarded in our minds constantly
[1:05:44] you know brother Braham says a thousand
[1:05:46] times a day because we're constantly
[1:05:48] being bombarded with unbelief and we and
[1:05:51] we entertain certain things and then we
[1:05:53] we see certain things and we and and and
[1:05:55] it's like like but you see we got to
[1:05:58] realize
[1:06:00] that we're in this
[1:06:03] flesh and there's certain things that he
[1:06:05] requires of us in order to
[1:06:09] overcome praise
[1:06:11] God I think we'll stop right there let
[1:06:13] the musicians
