[music] Oh, [singing] praise God. Praise God. [music] My sins [singing] are my soul. [music] Thanks be to the Lord. Uh I was thinking in my area there is an ice uh snow. So sorry for being late [music] a little bit because the time the the song leader and everyone of you I know you were waiting but tonight who is here you are going to be blessed because the Lord is open up his word to us. As good neighbor, we are blessed. We are so blessed. You don't realize it. But when you go out there even in the message church and you can see what the Lord has built on you, then you will know that you are blessed because your voice people will love to hear what you have been heard here by revelation that you didn't know. But God going to show it to you and say see I love you. You are my son. You are my daughter. I give you all that and his blessings will show to you that how much God love you. May the Lord bless each and every one of you. I won't take long. I will I'll just go straight on the scriptures and from the scriptures then I will start to uh share my testimony about what the Lord did. Uh Eugi, can you pray for us? Amen. Uh I will use the background Psalm 23. We're going to read from Psalm 23. Each and everyone know that simple scripture. Verse one going down says the Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He make me to lay down in green pasture. He leaded me beside the still waters. He restore my soul. He leaded me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake. Yay. Though I walk through the very of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. Thou anointed my head with oil, my cup run over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Please be seated. May the Lord add his blessing. The reason why I use this scripture, I'm going to give the testimony about my living here and I went to Ghana. After I got back, the Lord raised me up from the dead and I went back home with my wife. uh which it was a very uh nice trip. I thank the Lord for that and it was a very blessing to believers whom the Lord led me testify to. I use the same scripture that I use while I testify here about what happened to me, what the Lord has done. And the congregation there knows about it because one of their ministers called one of the churches. The minister called he was calling me because it was time for me to go back to my country and minister in that local church. The pastor name is called pastor Anan. Pastor Samuel know him. Brother Deson know him. They have preached there. So we are not strangers over there. The same size like our church. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; So when they call my wife told them what has happened to me that I have passed away dead come back life and right now I'm in the hospital so they should go on their knees and begin to pray for me. So the whole church was praying for me over there. So is it with Pastor Daniel Church too? They were praying for me over there. [snorts] So so many people were praying for me across the sea which is my back home country. And when they heard that I was coming from here, they couldn't wait to see and hear what the Lord has done already. Brother Desmond has gone there, told them what has happened because Desmond saw some of it at the hospital. So they they couldn't wait to see me face to face and I left here which was Wednesday the date I forgot and I arrived with my wife Thursday in Ghana. When we arrived it was around 5:00. Pastor Daniel whom came here and minister with his precious wife. They were in England coming Saturday. So we were in their house. Every time I go I stay in the his house at Ara. So they left the house for me big huge house with my wife and one brother that was living there. Before we wake up the brother is gone to work. So the house and will be left with me alone. Then when I reach my phone what I will use I have all the contact to contact the pastor there to contact the people I wanted to see. Somehow the phone is brand new. I bought it from uh uh uh one of the stores here, big stores, uh Costco, and the phone was somehow I couldn't get it through. Things were not going right. Everything I was trying to do was like messing up. I tried to let them help me do it. It doesn't work. So all the contact I have is on the phone and it was nothing but the devil trying to hold the testimony cuz people were going to be blessed about it. So I went to my village with my wife Friday. We left Wednesday. Remember Thursday I went to the village Friday with my wife. Left my wife to her mother and family there. After I left my wife, I went there with her brother who is a minister in pastor Daniel church. He drive Uber. I pay him and he he took us. I came back to the city Friday because Saturday I have to travel again to go to the second city which is Ashanti city called Kumasi. It's a big city. And I came back to Accra. My wife stay with her parents, her mother and the brother and whatever. I left her there because the Kumasi people were waiting for me to hear the testimony and I couldn't stay in the family and keep the testimony to myself. My wife would tell them. then I will go there personally for them to see me. So I I took off Saturday morning by like here we will say green coach the same size and went into that series. While I was there because of my phone condition the hotel I supposed to rent down floor because of I was thinking my situation I wanted to live in the down floor but because of the phone situation the brother couldn't get the down floor he get a third floor so when I arrived and it was night what should I do should I go try. Would I be able to clamp up? No elevator. I have to take the steps or what should I do? I have no choice. I said, okay. I said in my head, Lord, since I'm I got sick and came back, I haven't gone to third floor, but Lord, I'm going to trust you. So I started cramping and I was able to do it. Even the brother that get the hotel, he said he had a hard time to get that room for me. But when he saw me, he knew the situation because he's part of the family where my wife's senior s sister. So he knew what I was already going through. He was calling here almost every day to hear the situation. So when he saw me clamp up third floor, my goodness was great miracle for him to see because he says this is nothing but what God has really done. Even though it wasn't easy for me to climb, I was sweating and h tired. But the Lord helped me. I did it. So he was so shocked in shock and he says Kovi this is what your God has done. And I says yeah my God does anything that is impossible to man. So I get the third floor live there. Then I called I was able to contact Paul wife. I told her I wanted to see her. We goes to church Sunday for me to go and give my testimony to the church. So he came Sunday morning and I took her I and her plus the same uh uh uh I would say my sis and my wife's sister husband we went to the church three of us and when they saw me already they were singing when people saw me there it was even inspired to them they they because what they heard and what they are seeing was like my goodness the Lord has done it. This is nothing but the Lord that did it. So there people were so happy already. Then the pastor says, "Brother Kofi, you going to take the pulpit?" So they put me into the their office with the pastor sitting down. They singing, they rejoicing. Then all of a sudden, my time reach. And I said, "Lord, watch. I'm going to give the testimony to glorify you." And I use the same scripture about Lazarus, how I testify here. And I the best that the Lord give it to me, I begin to pour out my heart and share it with them. And the people were so blessed even to a point they don't know what to do. Wow. This is nothing. I says what you are seeing. You looking at your brother when you read the Bible about Lazarus in the Bible that was the old days when Jesus did it. Naturally speaking you and I wasn't there. But today, &gt;&gt; today now in your presence, Jesus has done it. &gt;&gt; I am the example. &gt;&gt; So the Lord don't want the scriptures to stay in the Bible. I told them he want the scriptures not just we going to just quote it. &gt;&gt; Not just read it, not just analyze it with big quotes. He want the letter to turn into you to make manifest &gt;&gt; because he show Lazarus that this is who I am. I am the resurrection and the life. &gt;&gt; And today the Lord want you &gt;&gt; to demonstrate &gt;&gt; his word. The Bible wanted to come out &gt;&gt; in you to be life. &gt;&gt; Amen. that the people can see. &gt;&gt; Oh my sister, my brother, the whole place was like fire. Somebody has spread fire on the people and they were rejoicing and thanking God. And I just testify because when I was going, me and Pastor Danny, we talk about it. He told me, he says, "Brother Kufi, you have the testimony. The Lord has given you testimony. Don't go and try to even preach or I said, "Pastor, let me tell you, I'm going to take your word." So, in my heart, I was going to just go testify what the Lord has done. And even I wanted to as a matter of fact stay away from the preaching so that I could go and eat natural food, natural h go here, relax on the tree having nice fun but not just because over there when I give myself they would take me and I won't have time for nothing. So I was trying to run away but not knowing the Lord have his plan. &gt;&gt; So when I testify like that the pastor rejoice. The pastor is taller like our pastor. So all of a sudden I came back to the hotel Monday morning my wife came from my village. Today there is about 4 hours. So I said, "Okay, we're going to stay here a little bit. We have some family too in Kumasi. Stay there little bit, relax, rejoice, try to walk the Ashanti, the king, he have his yard and there's a zoo around there. just go around and lash myself and and see what was out there for me and eat natural food, try myself clamping the hill and see how things will go. But all of a sudden my phone I give it to the family to try to do things so that everything will come. It doesn't work. No matter what they do, the phone is not working and I have all the people phone numbers. So the people I'm going to contact, it's like I don't have nobody but I says, "Hey Lord, whatever you want to do, let it happen." Anyway, I didn't come to preach or to get to know so many. I just come to relax myself. But that's not what the Lord want. Why my wife came? We were there. So I think Thursday that a week I said okay second week we're going to go visit Paul wife his mother the family and the people that came during the wedding Paul wedding there are so many people I have to thanks them say thank you people that came even I didn't know they came with their own cars, pain. So, and these people are important to me and I have to say thank you to them. So, that was on my heart to tell to go and see all those people. But while we were going to Paul Wife family in the car, all of a sudden my phone rang. When the phone ring, it was that pastor, pastor. He says, "Brother Kovi, I want to tell you, I want you to take Sunday service." I said, "Brother, I I I was sick. Since I was sick, I haven't preached. And I, as a matter of fact, I didn't come here to preach. I come here to relax myself, [laughter] enjoy myself with my wife and eat the natural food and go back. This is what I come here for. He says, "Brother, let me tell you, I want you to preach Sunday. My heart is telling me that you have to preach. I said, "Brother, this is hard." He says, "Get yourself ready. Sunday you taking the service." I said, "I don't know." He says, "Okay, you going to show up Sunday?" I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah." says, "Okay, prepare yourself." So why he spoke like that? The phone just cracked and my phone went dead again. I went with my wife. My wife says, "Who is who was calling you?" I says, "The pastor." He says, "All right, what does he want?" He says, "He want me to take the service Sunday." I said, "But I didn't come here to preach. My wife keep his mouth shut. So I I leave it alone." Then we went to Florence's house, eat nice natural food, talk, come back with my wife. Why we come back? And I open I pick up. I said, "Okay, I'm going to read the scripture." I pick up to Revelation. I think it was 22. When I pick up, all of a sudden my eye pop up to the scripture. Then it look like somebody God is great. All of a sudden, it look like somebody's dropping thoughts of the word of God into my head. It come like that. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Right away, I realize, hey, I can't say no. I have to take what the brother is saying. And I try to get away from there. open another another revelation and it goes with that scripture. Then the thought begin to form. Then tears begin to come on my eye. I says, "My God, what is going on? Lord, you want me to preach? If not, you know, I don't know nothing. Even revelation I haven't my life I have never ever even preach on revelation. Why my thought it goes that way? So I said okay I realize is the Lord dealing with me. So we try to I try to read the best I can. then get myself in shape so that even if I go and the the pastor says, "Okay, Kufi, if you won't preach, just stay away. I'm all right with it." So I go there, they were singing Sunday morning with my wife. As soon as I reach there, they take me to the pastor room. And pastor stay with me. He says, "Brother, you going to are you ready to take over?" I said, "Will you see what the Lord will do?" I said, "Brother, you know, I'm I'm since I I was sick and the Lord delivered me from dead. I having a stay on the Pope." He says, "Don't worry. God will take control. Don't worry about it. Everything the Lord will take control. and my brother, my sister. I get the son and I get into the pulpit. The Holy Spirit just took over me and I preached for 1 hour 30 minutes. My wife was even shocked when I spoke Finnish and all of a sudden I said who need prayer? The the the platform just about this size the frontier was filled with the whole congregation. And the pastor was rejoicing. The people were receiving the word. The word was coming like even I myself don't know. I I just stand there. He speak. I open my mouth and it it was like somebody putting words into my mouth. The thing coming from my heart then straight my mouth. So I wasn't worried. I just open the scripture, read the Bible. I don't know what I'm going to say, but I love the Lord and my heart was pure to him. I said, "Lord, I don't know if you don't come is a disaster." And trust me, he was right there. The Lord was right there. How did It says, "How did you know it? Even the people testify of it. They were rejoicing, thanking God, praising God and the happy it was overjoyed. Even my wife he says after the service he told me he says wow this is even I myself I'm impressed because this is husband the Lord because I know I wasn't expecting you to go stand there and preach for about 1 hour or even 45 minutes or like one and a half hours if you could have told me you preach like that. I would say no. And it was the power of God, not just words. God was in control. &gt;&gt; Was telling the people things like it says the spirit and the bride are one. The Lord was said saying to them, I'm here. I'm in you. It's not I'm just coming. I'm already in you. Do you recognize me? Do you see that I am in you? Because you looking for I am coming. I'm already in you. So recognize your day, your message, your hour, the time you are living in. Everything is ready. I am here with you. I am in you trying to tell you what you must do with my word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, so many things the Lord spoke. Tell them the book of Revelation is now revealed. Everything is open. I've spoke about you. You are here. So recognize it. Is you that I spoke about the book of Revelation. You are the revelation reveal. Oh, the people begin to jump praising God. Even the pastor there. Oh my. He couldn't sleep. Thanking God. The worst were coming. The worst were coming. And let me tell you, pastor said something Sunday. It's true. This message or this Bible, you can never study it and know it. &gt;&gt; You can. Yes. With your education, you may know the letter. But until God himself &gt;&gt; reveal it, &gt;&gt; you won't know nothing. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says the letter kill it. Think about it. Go in the Bible. How does Peter and John were able to preach? The people didn't even go to day I think daycare in their life. No, they don't have no even daycare 1 + 1 0 plus 0. They don't know. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says the people took knowledge because they have walked with Jesus. &gt;&gt; All Jesus want is our heart. When we give him the heart, he do the job. &gt;&gt; I believe in that. &gt;&gt; So God, he spoke through a donkey, right? Think about it. If you tell people today, the Lord spoke to a donkey, it doesn't sound with this technology, it doesn't sound right in humanity, but he did. He is telling humanity, I don't need nothing from you. Your wisdom, your education, just surrender your heart to me. When I get the heart, I will do the job. I will do the job. Your education, what I needing, give it to me. The one I don't need, I'll throw it in garbage and then I will show you what I can do with you. This is what he did with Moses, right? Moses tried with the education. He killed Egyptian &gt;&gt; intellectual. But when he gave his heart to the Lord for 40 years, the Lord dealt with him, took the education out. Right? When he surrender it to the Lord, the Lord did the job for him. He stand there. The Lord says, "Go to Pharaoh. Say this, say that, say this, say that." It wasn't Moses. It was God. &gt;&gt; And this is what the Lord is doing with us, you and I. Same thing he did it to William Abraham right William Abraham there are scriptures he couldn't read it but the Lord did through him you think that Lord change it doesn't change he's the same I am not saying education is not good I believe in education otherwise I won't let my daughter go to university I have the last one you in university too. But let me tell you education sometime become hindrance to the people to the word of God because God want our heart when the heart is open. I know I have seen that when your heart is open my heart is open. Let me tell you God can do a great things with us. Yes. &gt;&gt; He did things while I was in Ghana. Even the pastor called me. He says, "Brother, let me tell you the things you spoke was on my heart. I haven't preached about it yet, but you came. You spoke so many things that was on my heart. The Lord has revealed it to me. You came, you spoke it. Bang bang." And you know what the beauty about it? I'm not holding a message book. I'm not, you know me, I'm not a type I hold the Bible and open. Oh, this scripture, that scripture, this scripture, that scripture. But let me tell you, when the spirit take over. That's how the Lord used me. I gave him the heart. I said, Lord, I don't know. And you know, I'm not saying by my lips. I don't know. He knows. [snorts] Right. I just listen to the prophet tape. I just come to the church. I just listen to my pastor. I believe since Pastor Simon to Pastor Danny, I believe everything they preach here. I believe it. I believe everything the prophet spoke. [snorts] So I I can't read it better. I gave him my heart and let me tell you the people were blessed to a point the pastor called me back. He says brother let me tell you you don't know is the Lord that is using you. &gt;&gt; The Lord is using you. One of the brothers after the service a girl was sick. He come front. We pray for the the girl because something has happened to her. He come we pray after prayers within few days that girl was healed. &gt;&gt; I don't listen I I I'm not here for sure. This gospel is not for sure. God is real to you or he's not. &gt;&gt; That's how this gospel is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Either God is real to you &gt;&gt; or he's not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But when he's real to you, let me tell you nothing is impossible &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters. Nothing as your brother Kofi me nothing is impossible to me because God is real to me. God is real to me as you are sitting down. That's how he is real to me and I have met him. He has met me. I have met him. I have fought with him and I know that he is real. All my questions, all my doubt is gone. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you, oh my, &gt;&gt; Jesus is real to me. That's how I know him. So miracles for me. Miracles. Let me tell you, I've seen miracles upon miracles that the Lord have done for me my this eye to see. And I'm not just boasting. If people that are believers know that this brother he doesn't I can't speak much on I know I'm a talkative but not in the word of God when it comes to the word of God I don't know but how he let me know he just pour it in my heart and all of a sudden sometime I'm showering then the the thought coming is coming then oh I'm walking then it's coming that's how I got to know God listen to the tape read the Bible talking to sisters brothers then I'm listening my my my ear listening then I can see him in reality that's how I worship God &gt;&gt; because the prophet message when you listen it blesses your heart &gt;&gt; it become You take it in, it will be sweeter in your mouth, but bitter in your belly. Very bitter. It's not a joke. It's so bitter. But be ready to die with this message. Be ready to go in the grave with this message. Let me tell you, when he takes you into grave, it will bring you out. &gt;&gt; It will bring you out. Like I was fellowshipping with pastor Simon. He says, "Brother Kofi, Sunday we coming here to drink ooro." I says to him, "Ooguro." You know whaturo means? Nigeria says, "Oog, it means the African h alcohol, the hot one." In Ghana, we said aetish. Aeti means hot, hot, hot, hot drink. One white man drank it. It's so raw, you drink it, he fall down and die right there. But some people drink that one. You know when people drink they are so friendly they are so happy because why it h is changes their mood naturally and we know is of the devil but we we drink the spiritual drink from Jesus Christ when we drink it is supposed to change us so that the gospel become reality in our heart that the people will know it. Amen. &gt;&gt; After the service, one brother called me says, "Brother H somewhere over there, they call me pastor, but I they don't know I'm not a pastor." The brother says, "Pastor Kofi." I said, "Okay, brother." He says, "I want to give you right." And I know there's sisters and brothers there. Why you want to give me right that he's taking? So I said, "Oh brother, take the sisters and the brothers." Says, "Oh no, I'll take them. They can go with me on the road." He showed them place they should wait. But he wanted to take me. And I said I was in my heart. I was thinking, "Oh no, I can I have money in my p pocket to take a taxi with Rollins and we go home." Why the brother want to take me? But he in he inist insist that he should take me. Why he took me? You know what he says? Brother, let me tell you you you came here last time. The last time you came here, I was here. Says your preaching changed my life. There is things that I was going through. Nobody know. You came here, you preach, you spoke everything on your lips and my life is changed on the word. But I want to tell you, I won't reveal myself to you and I won't tell you details. Next time you come, I'll tell you. But I want you to know God is using you more than what you think. I says, brother, thank you. But give glory and honor unto the Lord. The most important thing is when someone tell you that your life has touched him through the word of God, then you give thanks unto the Lord because you recognize the message that you are under, the pastor that you are under, the message that you've been hearing from since the Lord brought you out from the street into the message, right? Sister Rosemary, Sister H sister Louie, sister Natasha, Sister, I can go on and on and on and on that you that are here long, you know what God has done for us, not what somebody is saying, right? So I give thanks unto the Lord. Let us back our pastor. let us as you is tough. It's not easy. Like sometime snow is out there, it's cold, is uh rough. But if the church door is open, just come. Don't stay home because you all the Lord is doing is he's burdening you. One of the days you're going to stand a place you know not. And God going to use you. God will use you. Let me tell you two days ago I called one of the pastor Simmon knows that man. One of the richest man in my country. The man have hotels and houses 100. Okay. In the city, the capital. He have 100 hotels in houses and hotels in the city. This man used to move with the government. The former president he has moved with he like he travel with like 10 SUV. This like our pastor car big size almost like that Toyota SOA and name it. You have Rolls-Royce. He have all the cars but he's sick and he was thanking me. Says the Lord, you know why? Nobody in my country could go to him and says things that I spoke to him. I told him face to face if you don't take Jesus, a vulture that will die on garbage is important than him. This man people have pistols when he's sitting. His securityities have pistols on them. He have soldiers. I I I sit with him. So I know have pistol on them. He could have said shoot the guy. But when I spoke there were people there. He didn't said a word. Later on he got sick so sick kidney problem he went to India. Now when I call him in two days because pastor Sam even was telling me oh okay have you heard about this man I says brother long time when I went home I didn't hear of him but I anyway I have his number I'll contact him. I called two days ago he called me. He was on the way to hospital. We talked for about 15 to 20 minutes on the phone. He was thanking the Lord. He was thanking me for even hearing the word of God coming from my mouth. Okay? This man moved with precedence. Not one. You go into his office, you you don't have to speak the the the pictures on the wall and he himself would the pictures would tell you what kind of person he is. Okay? And kings, he knows them. Money is nothing to him. But listen, it takes this gospel to go to the people and warn them about Jesus Christ and their life even if they don't come in the message at least they will get if they are not the bride they can become a foolish virgin or BE SAVED BECAUSE OF YOU. So God is journeying you. You may not know it. One day you meet somebody, before you know it, your mouth is speaking the word of God. Boom. You just spoke it. You wouldn't even think about it because why? The Lord, you come in here, he's talking to you every day. Sunday, Wednesday, you listen to Bible study. uh prayer night uh which we call a Bible study prayer night, Sunday service. The Lord is speaking to you. What do you think he's doing? He going to speak to you like that and you you you everything going to go under the the pillow. No. On a well, let me tell you, he has plant his seed in you. The seed is already planted. And when he want it, whether you like it or not, it's like a woman when a man planted the seed. Whether that woman like it or not, he have to bring forth. God in you will do the job. He will do the job with you even on aware. Right? All of a sudden, I I went I was sitting in the rich man place and in my heart I wanted to talk to him about the word of God. And I spoke things nobody in this earth have ever spoke to him. And he says, he told me, "Thank you. You are a really sincere person. You speak the truth." I told him, I says, "I know you have money. I can sleep on the street." I says, "I didn't come to you for your money. You think it's your money, then you and your money perish." Take Jesus. You have what the world don't have. You and I have it. So, let us feel proud &gt;&gt; in the Lord. Don't be discouraged. Be encouraged because the word of God is not here to put you down. Be encouraged in times of sorrow, in times of h happiness, EVERYTHING, GIVE THANKS unto the Lord. Even you going IN THE GRAVE, GIVE THANKS UNTO the Lord. You walking, give thanks unto the Lord. WHEN YOU ARE IN THE CHURCH, GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD. WHEN YOU ARE SITTING AT home with YOUR HUSBAND, GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD. WHEN YOU ARE WITH YOUR UH WIFE, GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD. WITH YOUR CHILDREN, GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD. With your pastor, IN FRONT OF YOUR PASTOR, GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD. WITH BELIEVER, GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD BECAUSE HE DESERVE YOUR PRAISES. THE LORD [screaming] DESERVE YOUR PRAISES. Not just in the church, but wherever you go. &gt;&gt; People may not know it, but God knows it. &gt;&gt; God knows it. When God listen, this is not a public show. Whether I preach, I don't preach, I don't care because all I care is does my King Jesus get the glory from me? what he brought me here for. Does he get it from me? Am I Am I serving my savior the way he sent me here for? Am I praising him the way he sent me here for? That's all I care about. So I went to Ghana by testifying. I came to Pastor Danny church. Pastor Danny, he came here with his wife. You some of you saw him the tall brother from Ghana that came here and preached one Wednesday he left his house for me the church for me to testify he has already told them over there I'm not a common I came back to Ara with my wife and there they were waiting for me already that time pastor Danny has come he told them already they knew it already oh when I got there testify oh People were rejoicing, giving thanks unto the Lord. They realized that, oh my God, this Bible, the letter in the Bible is not sleeping. Lazarus spirit is back again. Jesus has raised him up. That's a resurrection. Right? That's a type of resurrection. Jesus said, "I am the resurrection and the life." Right? So if we don't see that, this good neighbor have seen that. The Lord has raised me up. &gt;&gt; THE LORD has raised me up. &gt;&gt; I WAS DEAD AND HE BROUGHT ME ALIVE. &gt;&gt; So listen this church, don't let nobody fool you. What do you want to see out there? There's nothing out there. Don't even message me. Don't let nobody come and fool you. You will see the miracle RIGHT HERE. &gt;&gt; THE LORD HAVE USED YOUR BROTHER. HE RAISED ME UP. BROTHER PHILILLIP IS SITTING HERE. He know what I'm talking about. It's not me. And I didn't choose. It's not I'm going to brag. Oh, brother Kofi is a big spiritual mind. Oh, brother Kofi think he know everything this that. NO. GOD DID IT. The Lord Jesus did it. &gt;&gt; The Lord did it. HE KNOW WHEN HE does it, I'll give him praise for that. &gt;&gt; And he chose me to demonstrate the way I was sick. Sister Lim came there. Brother Mike came there. THEY SAW ME. I didn't see them. THEY KNOW GOD HAS DONE IT. IT'S a miracle that the Lord has done it. Don't let nobody come and fool you. You are seeing miracle. Good neighbor have seen the resurrection of Lazarus. God has used me. He has raised ME UP TO DEMONSTRATE his the way he raised Lazarus. You are seeing it. It's so real. IT'S NOT JOKE. EVEN I MYSELF, I don't know why it happened. But I give him the praise. I give him the glory because he's the only one that can do it. I can't do it. Nobody can do it. No priest, no pope, no king. This thing if the Oh my. Listen, some nurses WERE CRYING. THEY WERE CRYING. THEY SAW ME dead and I'm alive. &gt;&gt; Who has done this? Sister Elizabeth when he came to the hospital prophesied said, "Brother Kofi will rise up and come back and preach the gospel again." Sister Elizabeth, our own sister, spoke that to my family. That time I didn't know it. But what what what what are you looking for? The prophecy that he spoke has become what I was telling her Sunday. I said, "Sister, your prophecy while I was in Ghana was fulfilling alive. It has fulfilled here alive. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT GOD GOING TO USE YOU. We looking for something somewhere. No, look for your brother and sister. God is hidden in in us. &gt;&gt; The Lord is hidden in us from the pastor to the people. Okay? So have confidence. Talk to the Lord. If you doing something that is not good, cleaning your life, ask him for blessing. There's nothing wrong. Don't oh me alone carry the cross. You you alone don't carry the cross. The Lord has already carried for you. &gt;&gt; He want you to believe his word &gt;&gt; so that he you could walk on the water. Why you trusting in him? You could walk on the sea. &gt;&gt; You could walk on this world pure white as snow because he's in you. His blessing is upon you. Who can do it? Nobody. Only the Lord. ONLY THE LORD, KING OF KING can do it. &gt;&gt; AND HE HAS DONE IT for me. Listen, the rest of my life, I will worship him. Whether I listen, I don't care whether I don't preach, whether I sit down, whether I walk on the street, whether I [laughter] Everywhere I go, I'm going to tell it. I'm going to let people know. Last time I was telling one white mine in my area what the Lord has done. The man look at me and I told him how I was dead and they were ready to come and tell my wife to to prepare for funeral home. And I said, "You looking at me what the Lord has done. I'm still back here." He He GO, "WOW. WOW." I COULD SEE the man I just grow in front of me. I said, "If you don't believe me, let's go to the hospital right the town we live and we go and ask." I said, "When I reach there, I'll show you some nurses. They will testify unto you what has happened that even I wouldn't OPEN MY MOUTH. GOD, YOU DON'T know what God going to use you for. I didn't know that I will be like this to see what the Lord has done for us. Good neighbor, this is a testimony unto the Lord. Only the Lord DID IT. OUR GOD IS REAL. THE GOD BROTHER ABRAHAM SPOKE IS SO REAL TO ME. &gt;&gt; HE'S SO REAL. Is he REAL TO YOU? THEN REJOICE. GIVE HIM PRAISE. Give him thanks. GIVE HIM GLORY. GIVE HIM HONOR. LET ME tell you, he's so real to me. I can't deny. Listen, you put a gun into my head with this gospel. I cannot deny the Bible. Now I know why in Africa or maybe is some areas the Muslims when they are so zerous for their religion but when they get converted in Christianity I I didn't know I was going to speak today right some of them they are prince they they are top of their family but when Christ reveal himself to them and they want to chop off their head. They are not afraid. They wanted to give their head for this for the Bible. What the Bible Jesus has done for them. &gt;&gt; YOU AND I KNOW HIM IN REALITY OF HIS POWER AND of his resurrection. We know, we see what the Lord has done. Since Pastor Simon was preaching to us, what haven't we see? I have walked with him. I have slept with him. I've seen how the Lord move through that that e pastor to me. I'VE SEEN GOD USE HIM MIGHTILY. Thanksgiving church here we never seen. And I'm tell I'm just saying my heart like I'm going with a brother now. He's a preacher. That brother right there I'm going to leave you five minutes time. That brother right there, we were talking in my language. Pastor Son was sitting there in the front of the car. We were sitting at the back. All of a sudden, the brother asked me, "Your pastor speak Ghana language." I said, "No, we were talking in my language." Pastor Simmon just turned his head. He says you are saying this da da da da da da da da da. We speaking my language. My language. Me and the brother. Pastor Simon interpret every word to word. Then when he speak he turn his head front. Then the brother got shocked. Kovi, you said the man doesn't speak our your our language. How is he interpreting it? Pos says, "Do you believe God speak all the languages?" &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; You say you believe the Lord and this is what the people ARE LIKE WHEN IT COMES to court. This brother I'm talking, he can preach. He knows all the le in the Bible but he never seen reality like that. But when it shock him like that that you SEE BECAUSE THERE THAT one you can't take education and interpret it is coming put it this way I I put it in my way raw. No education to it. The word is coming. He says, "Do you believe God in can speak all languages? He's the one that make all languages." Then a song strike the brother heart. I He says, "Almighty God, you are the mighty God. There is no one like you." He started singing and crying. I was sitting with the brother I joined him started singing and crying right because why in reality like that it shook off the intellectuals away they don't want that but me kofi that's what I want &gt;&gt; when you want to talk about god talk about god in reality what our pastor was showing talking with the pastor then the crowd come right you go in the Bible is there you look it's right there on him right what do you going to say the intellectual person what he going to say God is not real THE LORD IS REAL HE DOES THE SAME THING HE DID TO MOSES HE DOES THE SAME THING HE DID TO WILLIAM ABRAHAM HE'S DOING THE SAME THING WITH HIS WIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER EVER EVER CHANGE. &gt;&gt; Let us believe him. &gt;&gt; His present is here. &gt;&gt; How many believe the Lord is here? &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, our God is real. &gt;&gt; OUR GOD IS REAL. YOU AND I, God is real. &gt;&gt; I was dead. I am alive. But Son came there. He said, "Braovi is not dead. He's sleeping." BROTHERS, SISTERS, YOUR BROTHER WAS DEAD. OH, [laughter] I WAS DEAD. [screaming] COMPLETELY DEAD. EVEN WHEN I WAKE up the way I was, I said, "Lord, if the way I am, if this, if I die again and it will going to glorify you, let let me go. If not, then heal me." All of a sudden within one week, two week my body begin to bum bum bum bum b. I'm standing here today. Listen, I'm so happy in my heart. I DON'T HAVE NO BITTERNESS ONE BIT BECAUSE AND MY HEART IS AT PEACE. When you talk about peace, you see me even I MAY NOT TALK. BUT WHEN YOU TALK about peace, Jesus said, "My peace I give it ONTO YOU." NOT AS THE WORLD GAVE. &gt;&gt; We need that peace. &gt;&gt; Don't we want that peace? As soon as you get that peace, it's not about money. Oh, it's not about popularity. It's not about education. It's not about how much people love you. people because we humanity we have sit in the message for so long. Some people can pretend they are so good. We humans we do that and underneath is nothing but a snake or cobra hiding there. The Lord knows the heart. &gt;&gt; And when the heart is right, then when it's time for him to strike the seed, for that seed to bring forth, YOUR SEED TO BRING FORTH, MY SEED to bring forth, the Lord bring it. And it is a perfume. Yes, &gt;&gt; it Saudi Arabia they have I think Saudi Arabia or Egypt one of them they have the best perfume in the world when you when you use it when you are you pass here one week that smell will fill this womb because why the Lord perfume on you when it bring it alive people will rejoice people will seize it will shock you you yourself. He shock you and shake you. You know you haven't done nothing but you give glory to him. And he says, "Son, daughter, this is me. I the Lord be not afraid. If you need anything, ask me. Ask me. You need, you are short of things, ask me. I am a provider. Don't be lazy. If you are lazy, I won't give it to you. &gt;&gt; It's not your boss. It's not your work. It's ether on me and let me youal &gt;&gt; then everything will be perfect. Sorry for my broken words. This is all I have for you. God bless you. God be with you. God be with our pastor. Whoever is watching this broken west, I didn't come tonight to preach. I come to share what the Lord did in my country. And I'm so blessed by God what he has done.
