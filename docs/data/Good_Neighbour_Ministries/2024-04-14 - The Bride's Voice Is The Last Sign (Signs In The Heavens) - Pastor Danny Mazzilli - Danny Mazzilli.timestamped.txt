[34:12] sky and by what the Lord is doing in
[34:15] this hour uh he's making himself known
[34:18] amen that we are definitely almost home
[34:22] amen praise God God bless you Saints um
[34:26] thank you very much musicians song
[34:28] leader thank you brother Mike praise God
[34:30] that was a wonderful song
[34:32] service we are certainly listening for a
[34:35] different sound in this hour we've got
[34:37] to know the sound that we that that we
[34:39] that we need to be listening to we need
[34:41] to recognize the word that God is uh
[34:44] giving us in our day making known to us
[34:47] in this day and in this hour amen praise
[34:49] God I trust you're all uh very um hungry
[34:53] this morning amen praise God because the
[34:56] Lord he wants to bless us he wants to
[34:59] pour His word into us he wants to anoint
[35:02] us he wants to give us exactly what we
[35:05] have need of but you've got to be under
[35:07] that kind of expectation amen you've got
[35:10] to believe that you've come into the
[35:12] house of the Lord into the presence of
[35:15] the Lord amen praise God where God will
[35:18] make all things possible praise the Lord
[35:21] amen so um first of all we want to
[35:24] remember brother um Peter Chandler's
[35:28] Pastor uh Peter Chandler from London
[35:31] England he passed away this past week
[35:35] and we want to remember his family and
[35:38] his congregation because it was uh kind
[35:41] of all of a sudden that uh that he
[35:43] passed away and now the church is kind
[35:46] of um you know looking for for a new
[35:49] leader because it happened just
[35:52] automatically just fast just like that
[35:55] and you just don't know when the Lord is
[35:56] going to call but the Lord the Lord has
[35:58] a reason you know he has a purpose and
[36:01] one by one we will gain the portal to be
[36:04] with the immortal we don't know our time
[36:08] we know that there's a time to be born
[36:09] and we also know that there is a time to
[36:12] die but then we're in a time of the
[36:15] Rapture and so for us we're under a
[36:17] different kind of expectation as long as
[36:20] the Lord doesn't take us physically
[36:22] naturally now then he's taken us in the
[36:26] body change amen it's as simple as that
[36:28] that's that's what we believe that's how
[36:30] we see the word of God we're living in
[36:33] that day and that's what excites us as
[36:35] the Sons and Daughters of god so let's
[36:38] remember them uh remember his family
[36:40] remember his congregation that the Lord
[36:42] will provide Pastor Simon knows him he
[36:45] actually ministered um in London there
[36:48] just a few years ago and uh was with
[36:50] brother Chandler so um you know I've
[36:54] never met him but uh Pastor Simon did
[36:57] get to meet him a couple of years ago
[36:59] and and was with them there so uh praise
[37:01] God Amen so now now let's um let's move
[37:06] on to what the Lord has for us today how
[37:08] many knows that we're still in the in
[37:10] the Passover season we're still in the
[37:12] Easter season amen praise God it's
[37:14] always Easter for us you know and I was
[37:16] I was looking to see this year Passover
[37:18] begins actually for the you know for the
[37:20] Hebrews for the Jews uh Monday April the
[37:23] 22nd so next Monday uh at sundown and it
[37:26] ends on Tuesday April the 30th at
[37:29] sundown you know so um this is the
[37:32] English calendar the Hebrew calendar
[37:35] it's their first month right April is
[37:37] actually the first month in the Hebrew
[37:40] calendar ours is January for the Hebrews
[37:44] it's April right and so um you know when
[37:47] we look at Israel and we look at what's
[37:49] going on right now we know that Israel
[37:52] is God's time piece how many knows that
[37:54] how many understands that right now all
[37:56] these events that are taking place
[37:59] around the Middle East and around Israel
[38:02] is exactly in direct correlation to the
[38:05] mystical body of Jesus Christ The Church
[38:08] of Jesus Christ and so we need to see
[38:11] the parallels we need to see what's
[38:13] actually going on and recognize that it
[38:16] has everything to do with us all right
[38:19] because Israel is the natural type of
[38:22] the spiritual bride of Jesus Christ the
[38:25] church that is uniting with Christ right
[38:29] now in this hour Israel is being tested
[38:32] right now to the very core they're being
[38:34] tested on their faith and they're saying
[38:37] we are not going to move until we take
[38:40] the enemy's head off and I believe that
[38:43] the same Revelation is living within us
[38:48] that we are the church we are the the
[38:50] the the ones that that God has revealed
[38:52] his word to by his grace okay we didn't
[38:56] choose him he chose us amen it was not
[38:59] something that we decided God chose
[39:01] Israel God did not it wasn't Israel that
[39:04] chose them God chose them he says they
[39:07] shall be my people and I shall be their
[39:10] God okay when Jacob and Esau were were
[39:13] born he says Jacob I love Esau I hate we
[39:17] cannot alter God's plan God's program
[39:20] and what it is that God is doing in this
[39:22] day and in this hour but because God has
[39:24] given us ears to hear I to see and
[39:28] recognize what God is doing in this hour
[39:31] we can see all of this and recognize
[39:34] that this has everything to do with us
[39:37] the timing on everything is not a
[39:39] coincidence these signs and these
[39:42] Wonders that we've been witnessing over
[39:44] the last you know several years and and
[39:47] in particular the last seven years with
[39:49] the 2017 eclipse and the 2024 Eclipse
[39:53] these things are are significant okay I
[39:57] I don't know why God just put it all
[39:59] over me to you know to dig into it and
[40:01] you know Wednesday night we dug into a
[40:03] lot of the facts that surround it and a
[40:05] lot of the things that that that we're
[40:07] seeing there but I do know that God is a
[40:11] supernatural God I do know that God
[40:14] declares his first Bible in the heavens
[40:17] before he does anything on Earth he
[40:19] declares it in the heavens we know that
[40:21] for a fact I know that God is a
[40:24] supernatural God I have had experience
[40:27] experiences and you who are children of
[40:30] God that have actually met God know that
[40:32] you have an experience with God and that
[40:35] these signs are not just happen sense
[40:39] they're not just things that just
[40:41] happened they come and they go they have
[40:44] a purpose and they're directly
[40:45] correlated to the word of God Amen
[40:48] praise God and so in in looking into all
[40:52] of this here today we are going to be
[40:54] looking at things that that we that we
[40:57] already know okay all I know Saints is I
[41:00] don't understand every single
[41:03] sign okay let's make that clear I'm not
[41:06] coming out here as a as a minister and
[41:09] saying this is how it's going to be this
[41:11] is what it is this no God is his own
[41:14] interpreter I am going to bring to you
[41:17] exactly what God has placed upon my
[41:19] heart to bring to you and then it's up
[41:22] to the Holy Spirit to reveal directly to
[41:24] you how it is that you fit in into the
[41:27] whole thing I know how I'm seeing my
[41:30] part in the word I know I'm seeing the
[41:32] part that God has given me and now I'm
[41:35] stepping into my position by obeying the
[41:38] Lord in what he's revealed to me and
[41:40] what he said tell the people and so by
[41:43] by all of these events and and it's
[41:45] going to there's no way we're going to
[41:47] be able to finish all of this today it's
[41:49] going to probably finish into next
[41:51] Sunday okay and I'm very excited about
[41:54] what God is revealing okay and and uh
[41:58] it's not because oh he's just revealing
[42:00] it to Pastor Danny no no God has
[42:03] ministers all over the Earth just like
[42:06] he had the three wise men they were in
[42:08] different parts of the world but when
[42:10] God Drew their attention to the stars
[42:14] and Drew their attention to what they
[42:16] knew according to the word and according
[42:18] to the sages of what they had been told
[42:20] and they put one in one together and
[42:23] they saw the lining up of the stars all
[42:25] three of them saw the exact same thing
[42:29] and they were drawn to the Messiah they
[42:32] were drawn to the word amen and so we as
[42:36] Ministers of the Gospel we operate in
[42:39] exactly the same way because God has
[42:42] given us these callings for us to be
[42:44] able to recognize the word of God draw
[42:47] from it pull it down bring it into our
[42:50] own experiences and then convey it unto
[42:53] the people the people that are in the
[42:56] midst of this Ministry and that are
[42:58] going to be hearing these words are
[43:00] going to be able to see how they fit
[43:02] into the word and what their part is and
[43:06] how significant it is to God Amen all I
[43:10] can tell you is that these things that
[43:12] the Lord is showing me I can't even put
[43:15] them to words all I can do is try to
[43:17] express it to you but there's there were
[43:19] things that I was seeing over the last
[43:21] week that I was just getting up and
[43:24] walking around and wondering my God this
[43:26] is this is it it can't be but it is it's
[43:31] just the way it is and so these are the
[43:33] things that we're going to convey to you
[43:35] and I trust that as we we move into it
[43:38] that your your heart and your mind is
[43:41] open to the understanding that that we
[43:43] are moving in a
[43:45] supernatural this church is not a
[43:48] regular on the street New Street Church
[43:51] oh yeah I've seen that church yeah it is
[43:53] a church building but it's not the
[43:56] building it's the people in the building
[43:59] that are with the god that's in the
[44:00] building and that's what makes the true
[44:03] church is when the Holy Spirit is in the
[44:05] church speaking to the needs of the
[44:08] people and when they come in it's like
[44:09] they're going into a into the shakina
[44:12] glory of God some will come in with with
[44:15] with uh sickness some will come in with
[44:17] blindness some will come in with with
[44:20] hurts and pains and then they'll leave
[44:22] here rejoicing why because they went and
[44:25] heard a sermon from Pastor Dany no
[44:27] because they entered into the presence
[44:29] of the Lord and they had already met God
[44:33] and knew that God was a
[44:35] reality it's not something that you just
[44:38] you know you you just oh I'm going to go
[44:40] to church and that'll be the moment that
[44:42] I that I I hear some nice words and and
[44:45] the pastor is going to bring a nice
[44:47] message oh and it sounds really good
[44:49] that's not really what church is all
[44:51] about church is when you come into the
[44:53] shakina glory of God with expectation in
[44:56] your heart and you're going to leave
[44:58] because you've you walked in with a
[45:00] supernatural experience and you're
[45:02] leaving with a supernatural experience
[45:05] amen praise God so I trust that that
[45:07] that this word that's going to come
[45:09] forth will do and change and alter your
[45:13] walks and and allow you to to to be
[45:15] stirred to look and to check yourself to
[45:18] remind yourself of the things that God
[45:20] has already done in your life because if
[45:23] you've met God God becomes a reality to
[45:25] you nobody can and take that from you
[45:29] amen praise God forever
[45:32] more now now we can go to the word
[45:35] praise God Amen let's go to the
[45:40] word Luke chapter
[45:43] 21
[45:45] 25-28 and there shall be signs in the
[45:48] Sun and in the moon and in the stars and
[45:50] upon the Earth distress of nations with
[45:54] perplexity the Sea and the waves roaring
[45:58] Saints is that not the time that we're
[46:00] living in right
[46:01] now men's Hearts failing them for fear
[46:06] and for looking after those things which
[46:08] are coming on the earth people are in
[46:10] fear people don't know what to make of
[46:13] all these events what's going on
[46:16] yesterday there was an attack on Israel
[46:18] again over 300 missiles coming into
[46:21] Israel from Iran these are these are not
[46:24] just you know simple events that are
[46:26] just happening in the midst of a Middle
[46:28] East war no no these are significant
[46:31] event Saints praise God Amen and people
[46:35] are are are under under fear they don't
[46:37] know what to do they don't understand
[46:39] what's coming on the earth earthquakes
[46:41] over here tsunamis over here flooding
[46:44] over there all kinds of things for the
[46:46] powers of Heaven shall be shaken amen
[46:50] and then shall they see the son of man
[46:53] coming in a cloud with power and great
[46:56] Glory
[46:57] and when these things begin to come to
[47:00] pass look up and lift up your heads amen
[47:05] for your Redemption draw nigh God bless
[47:09] you you may be
[47:13] seated next slide brother Bram says here
[47:16] and then every sign has a voice behind
[47:20] it and the voice must be a scriptural
[47:24] voice the same as it must be a
[47:27] scriptural
[47:28] sign and then the sign is accompanied by
[47:32] a voice like Moses when he went down
[47:35] into Egypt the voice of the first sign
[47:38] the voice of the second sign and every
[47:41] great thing that happens with God that
[47:44] gives a sign there's a voice that
[47:48] follows that sign like Jonah when he was
[47:52] delivered from the belly of the whale
[47:55] that was a sign then his his voice was
[47:57] repent or in 40 days you'll perish so
[48:01] there's always the voice going with the
[48:06] sign praise God forever
[48:09] more you know um brother brandham here
[48:13] in uh
[48:16] 1964 he says here uh also Christ is
[48:19] identified the same in all generations
[48:21] and then every sign has a voice behind
[48:23] it and the voice must be a scriptural
[48:25] voice and the same as it must be a
[48:28] scriptural sign okay we just read that
[48:32] we need to understand that in every age
[48:35] God has a voice God will have somebody
[48:39] in representation of himself making
[48:43] himself known making himself real and we
[48:46] understand that that voice can only be
[48:50] in the resurrected body of Jesus Christ
[48:53] because it's his voice amen so the
[48:55] resurrection that's why he says you know
[48:58] uh the sign of Jonah because Jonah was
[49:01] in the belly three days and then three
[49:04] nights and then on the third day he come
[49:06] out of the belly of the whale walked out
[49:08] onto the street all all into Nineveh and
[49:11] started to to preach repentance under
[49:13] the people or God was going to destroy
[49:15] them in 40 days and so God's voice was
[49:19] in Jonah telling the people what had
[49:23] taken place letting them know what God
[49:26] was going to to do and make known to the
[49:28] people that they either turn to God or
[49:31] they're going to be destroyed amen
[49:33] praise God and so these signs when God
[49:36] sends a sign it's because God is going
[49:39] to send a message God has a message in
[49:42] this day God has a message in this hour
[49:45] God has a message today for each and
[49:48] every one of us do we have our spiritual
[49:51] thinking caps on Amen praise God listen
[49:56] here in psalm
[49:57] 147 God is calling us to his attention
[50:00] listen he says praise ye the Lord for it
[50:02] is good to sing praises unto our God for
[50:06] it is pleasant and praise is calmly the
[50:09] Lord doth build up
[50:12] Jerusalem he gathereth together the
[50:15] outcasts of Israel listen remember what
[50:18] I said when when when we're talking
[50:19] about Israel we're talking about the
[50:21] church there's still some outcasts out
[50:24] there there's still some that need to
[50:26] awaken to recognize what God is doing in
[50:28] this hour so that they can be pulled in
[50:30] to the body he gathereth together the
[50:33] outcast he Health the broken hearts and
[50:36] bindeth up their wounds he he tth the
[50:40] number of the Stars he calleth them all
[50:43] by their names amen praise God God is
[50:46] still calling God is still calling Sons
[50:50] and Daughters of God but we need to
[50:52] recognize we need to recognize the signs
[50:55] we need to see what the voice is telling
[50:58] us we need to realize listen brother
[51:00] brandham said that uh you know in if you
[51:02] go back and if you get a chance this
[51:04] week go back and listen to the message
[51:06] uniting sign and time okay uniting time
[51:11] and sign okay it's either that way or
[51:13] that way but go back and listen to that
[51:16] because that's going to come into uh re
[51:19] relevance next Sunday when we come
[51:21] together because things are happening
[51:24] there's a uniting that's going on right
[51:26] now
[51:27] there's uniting of the of the of the
[51:29] churches there's a uniting of the of of
[51:33] Israel amen they're they're they're
[51:36] coming back together again they're
[51:38] standing in their position they're
[51:40] they're being told that they will not uh
[51:43] you know by their leadership that they
[51:44] will not give up one ounce of the land
[51:47] this shall never happen again they've
[51:49] United together they're in one mind
[51:52] under one inspiration just as the bride
[51:55] is uniting but but then you've got the
[51:57] World Council of churches that are
[51:59] uniting then you've got the Nations that
[52:01] are uniting they're all uniting around
[52:05] coming against Israel in the same way
[52:07] that the churches are uniting together
[52:10] to come against the word of God because
[52:12] the word they're saying no no we have to
[52:14] have a a universal Christianity we have
[52:18] to have one that everybody can fit into
[52:21] God says separate
[52:23] yourselves God says I am the word and
[52:26] and and the word is God and and if the
[52:30] word is God and we have the word then we
[52:33] can't do or believe anything but the
[52:35] word because we live the word we are the
[52:38] word we are the manifestation of the
[52:41] word just like Israel are God's chosen
[52:44] people they can't help but be who they
[52:46] are and because they are who they are
[52:48] and they stand on that position God
[52:52] stands with them hallelujah praise God
[52:55] everything
[52:57] everything that that uh uh you know is
[53:00] taking place now with these signs go to
[53:03] the next
[53:04] slide and so what we're going to be
[53:06] talking about here
[53:08] today and today we're going to be laying
[53:10] in a foundation of a lot of things that
[53:13] we already know but it's going to remind
[53:16] us of the progression of what God is
[53:19] doing and we're going to be looking at
[53:21] the fact that the bride's voice is the
[53:24] last sign if there's going to any voice
[53:27] in the land right now it's the church
[53:30] it's the bride and it's
[53:33] Israel Israel is taking their
[53:36] stand okay they're taking their stand
[53:38] and they're saying we are not going to
[53:40] submit listen it it's not Israel that's
[53:43] going out and
[53:46] bombing the Esau
[53:49] lineage okay Israel is in their Homeland
[53:52] that God gave them they're not they're
[53:54] not the ones that are going out and and
[53:56] and bombing and and killing in other
[53:59] people's countries they are coming and
[54:02] infiltrating and bombing
[54:05] them all right they're talking and
[54:07] they're saying that that Israel is
[54:09] committing genocide genocide is when you
[54:12] try to eliminate a race of people a
[54:16] total race of people that's not what
[54:19] Israel is trying to do okay Israel is
[54:23] trying to stand on the word that God
[54:26] gave them the land that God gave them
[54:28] and and you cannot change the word of
[54:31] God God gave it to them there's nothing
[54:33] that anybody can do to take
[54:36] it they're going to gather themselves
[54:38] around Israel the all the nations are
[54:40] going to gather they're already starting
[54:42] to talk that they're G to that they're
[54:44] that they're you know they're saying oh
[54:46] you know they're saying oh they're
[54:47] committing genocide they're killing
[54:49] people meanwhile what took place back in

[55:26] years has been digging tunnels in and
[55:28] through uh Gaza and and and penetrating
[55:32] in all different areas because they have
[55:34] one purpose you know that you know that
[55:37] lineage has one purpose and that is to
[55:39] destroy and they have the idea of
[55:43] genocide they want to eliminate and
[55:45] Destroy every Jewish individual on the
[55:49] planet if they can do it it's the same
[55:51] spirit that was on Hitler amen okay and
[55:55] so we need to recognize I know the
[55:57] people listen it's when you hear the
[56:00] news and and you hear them talking about
[56:02] oh little innocent children are being
[56:04] killed and that's War it's terrible it's
[56:08] terrible but whenever there's war and
[56:10] people are fighting against each other
[56:12] there's going to be collateral damage
[56:15] but what happens is if you start to
[56:16] emphasize only on the actual collateral
[56:19] damage and and not recognize the reasons
[56:23] behind everything then you lose sight of
[56:26] the reality of who you are and the bride
[56:29] cannot lose reality in sight of who she
[56:32] is in the word of God and that God has a
[56:35] church that is going to listen and obey
[56:38] his word that are going to live by his
[56:40] word that are going to say no baptism is
[56:43] in the name of Jesus Christ it's not
[56:45] into the titles of son Father Son and
[56:47] Holy Ghost she's going to stand on the
[56:49] word and say there is no three Gods
[56:52] there's only one god Jehovah of the Old
[56:55] Testament is Jesus of the new the
[56:57] Messiah the word was made flesh and
[57:00] dwelt Among Us in the beginning was the
[57:02] word the word was with God the Word was
[57:05] God not was God's was
[57:09] God and so Emmanuel God With Us he went
[57:15] and took our place as a man in a human
[57:19] body but it was God that was in that
[57:22] body that's why he's the only one that
[57:24] could resurrect himself from from the
[57:26] dead because he is life he is the only
[57:30] life and so Israel knows that they know
[57:34] that God is going to stand with them
[57:36] regardless of what comes against them if
[57:39] they surround them and the Bible and the
[57:42] prophecy shows very clearly that this is
[57:45] going to happen we could get into all
[57:48] kinds of scripture to show you that they
[57:50] shall surround Israel and they are going
[57:53] to they're going to try and Destroy
[57:55] Israel but God is going to
[57:58] supernaturally deliver them out of the
[58:00] midst of the
[58:03] destruction Hallelujah and he's going to
[58:06] do the same for you're not going into
[58:08] tribulation you're not going into the
[58:10] tribulation that's coming upon this
[58:12] Earth listen things are not getting
[58:14] better you don't even have to be a
[58:15] Christian to see that all you got to do
[58:18] is turn CNN on and you can find out
[58:20] world events and things that are
[58:22] happening that this world is falling
[58:23] apart you can do a search on on on
[58:26] YouTube earthquakes current earthquakes
[58:29] you'll probably get five six current
[58:31] earthquakes Tremors over here Tremors
[58:33] over there what is it the Earth is in
[58:35] birth pains they're talking about the
[58:38] Earth that it's that it's that it's
[58:39] heating up do you know that this month
[58:42] is the 10th month in a
[58:45] row that we have broken records for
[58:48] global temperatures in the
[58:52] history since they've been monitoring it
[58:57] what is that why why why is it that that
[59:01] the that the Earth is is heating
[59:04] up oh the scripture says oh behold this
[59:08] Earth as an oven should burn Hallelujah
[59:11] there's going to be there's going to be
[59:13] uh things that are going to happen now
[59:15] there's a time and a season for it all
[59:17] to come but it's it's in progress It's
[59:20] happening around us we need to recognize
[59:22] that it's taking place and people need
[59:25] to need to understand that it's that it
[59:27] is the reality amen and so these signs
[59:31] and these things that are taking place
[59:33] around us it's important for us to
[59:36] realize it's bringing prophecy to pass
[59:41] it is it is the being declared in the
[59:43] heavens and then it is being declared on
[59:45] the
[59:46] earth
[59:47] Hallelujah let's go to the next
[59:52] slide now we saw this slide here on
[59:54] Wednesday night and I'm not going to get
[59:57] into all the details of it again but I
[59:59] just want you to realize that you know
[1:00:01] if you look at the slides that I've been
[1:00:03] putting up you'll notice in the corner
[1:00:05] you'll see like like the American flag
[1:00:09] because everything is surrounding
[1:00:11] America listen we got to recognize that
[1:00:13] God sent a prophet out of America that's
[1:00:16] where God sent the prophet God God sent
[1:00:19] signs and wonders out of America to
[1:00:21] America because America is like a type
[1:00:25] of the Gentile that that that that where
[1:00:27] the Gentile bride has come out of where
[1:00:30] the Gentiles have received the word for
[1:00:32] their day where they've been turned back
[1:00:35] to the faith of the fathers and it's all
[1:00:37] judgment towards America these two solar
[1:00:42] eclipses they declared that they they
[1:00:45] they called them the Great American
[1:00:47] solar eclipses because they they went
[1:00:50] from one end to the other on the 17th
[1:00:53] you'll see the one that comes down from
[1:00:55] the left down the one from the right
[1:00:57] down that's the one that was
[1:00:59] 2024 you'll notice that there's a big X
[1:01:03] over America and if you go back into the
[1:01:05] scriptures you'll see that x what it
[1:01:07] represents and and it's
[1:01:10] basically you're done you're finished
[1:01:13] amen there's no hope except for the
[1:01:15] coming of the Lord listen America as a
[1:01:18] nation as much as there's a lot of
[1:01:20] preachers out there that want to say oh
[1:01:22] America still has a chance they can
[1:01:25] repent as as a nation no they can't the
[1:01:28] nation is finished I listen I'm not I'm
[1:01:31] not telling you this because you know
[1:01:33] it's what I believe it's because that's
[1:01:35] what God is declaring God decare it
[1:01:38] through a Vindicated prophet of William
[1:01:40] maryiam Branham when he indicted that
[1:01:43] generation of the United States of
[1:01:44] America for the second crucifixion of
[1:01:47] Jesus Christ when they when they
[1:01:49] rejected the word of God they rejected
[1:01:52] God's sign to this generation and to do
[1:01:56] that will bring judgment now on the
[1:01:59] other hand there's still people in
[1:02:02] America individuals that can still
[1:02:05] receive the message of Salvation that
[1:02:09] can still receive the power of the Holy
[1:02:11] Ghost to deliver them From The Snare of
[1:02:14] the Great Tribulation that's going to
[1:02:16] come down upon this Earth and so if
[1:02:19] there's a message the message is
[1:02:22] personal the mer the message is to the
[1:02:24] individual and it's and it's the same
[1:02:27] message repent turn away from your
[1:02:30] ungodliness and turn to God and receive
[1:02:33] his spirit amen and salvation shall come
[1:02:36] to you and to your home praise God
[1:02:39] hallelujah
[1:02:41] amen go to the next slide
[1:02:44] Hallelujah now we know that we just
[1:02:48] came sorry I double clicked on that one
[1:02:53] okay so this next slide here the only
[1:02:55] reason I'm showing you this one here is
[1:02:58] because you'll notice this was the one
[1:03:00] for 2017 the one that has the uh the the
[1:03:03] green blue lines there the other one
[1:03:07] that crosses through from bottom to the
[1:03:09] right that's the 2024 do you know there
[1:03:12] was another eclipse that took place in
[1:03:15] October of
[1:03:17] 2023 right around the time of the attack
[1:03:22] on Israel which was yam Kapur
[1:03:25] right at that time and that Eclipse when
[1:03:29] I put it into the page and I put the
[1:03:33] because I saw the two there 2024 and the
[1:03:36] one from there and then I said oh wait a
[1:03:37] minute let me put the one from 2017 in
[1:03:39] there it created an A and it just spoke
[1:03:43] and said I am Alpha I am the Omega I am
[1:03:47] the first I am the last I have the first
[1:03:50] say I have the last say everything that
[1:03:53] is going on I am de claring it in the
[1:03:57] heavens and the people shall know that I
[1:03:59] am God they will know that I will give
[1:04:02] them a testimony that Jesus Christ is
[1:04:06] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:04:08] that there's no other God except Jehovah
[1:04:11] God his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:14] amen praise God and if we go to the next
[1:04:17] slide just a reminder that you know
[1:04:21] brother brandham saw the ages and saw
[1:04:25] the amount of life light that was in
[1:04:26] every age and I found it very
[1:04:29] interesting that when I looked into this
[1:04:31] and because I realized that you know
[1:04:33] that there was a sliver of light that
[1:04:35] was going to be given to the to to the
[1:04:37] church because it was it went into total
[1:04:40] darkness by the time brother brandham
[1:04:42] was on the earth and he was the seventh
[1:04:45] angel messenger just like you know you
[1:04:47] got to go back and do your history here
[1:04:49] you know St Paul was the first one then
[1:04:51] there's irius then there was St Martin
[1:04:54] Columba then Martin Luther who broke
[1:04:56] away from the Catholic church then there
[1:04:59] was John Wesley and then came William
[1:05:02] Mariam brandham Elijah the prophet okay
[1:05:05] he was under the ministry of a
[1:05:08] Vindicated major prophet to restore the
[1:05:12] word of God in our day amen praise God
[1:05:15] otherwise we'd still be in confusion we
[1:05:17] wouldn't know what church to believe
[1:05:19] because by the time you get to Wesley
[1:05:22] you've got so many different
[1:05:23] denominations and so many different
[1:05:26] interpretations on God's Bible that you
[1:05:28] don't know what to believe but God
[1:05:31] always reveals it unto his servants the
[1:05:33] prophets and so he gave us a a Slimmer
[1:05:37] of light because William brandham was
[1:05:40] going to restore the word and it was
[1:05:42] going to be a minority it's always been
[1:05:44] a minority amen listen don't be going to
[1:05:46] look you know thinking but you know
[1:05:48] people will say how is it that these
[1:05:50] people are believing this message this
[1:05:53] William Branham no you know hardly
[1:05:56] anybody's ever heard of him if you do a
[1:05:58] search online you're going to get one
[1:06:00] extreme that says he was a cult leader
[1:06:01] you're going to get another extreme that
[1:06:03] says he was
[1:06:04] God he
[1:06:06] was he was a portion of Prophecy being
[1:06:11] fulfilled in our day he fulfilled
[1:06:15] Malachi 4:5 he fulfilled Revelations 10
[1:06:19] 1-7 if you had have gone back in the
[1:06:21] days of Jesus and you would have seen
[1:06:23] this man John the Baptist he was a hairy
[1:06:26] man he was a man of the Wilderness he
[1:06:28] was screaming out to the people telling
[1:06:30] them repent repent the coming of the
[1:06:32] Lord a lot of people all the Pharisees
[1:06:35] the all the big churches of the day they
[1:06:38] looked and they said what is this noise
[1:06:39] going on over here who is this guy
[1:06:41] that's look at him he doesn't even shave
[1:06:44] he he looks like a bum you know and then
[1:06:47] you listen to William brandom and you
[1:06:48] listen to the way he talks in his
[1:06:50] vocabulary and people say man you can
[1:06:53] did the guy have any kind of an
[1:06:54] education yeah he had grade five
[1:06:56] education but he had something that that
[1:06:59] that a grade five education uh is is
[1:07:02] totally irrelevant to he had the spirit
[1:07:04] of the Living God in him and I challenge
[1:07:07] anybody to go back and listen or read
[1:07:09] his messages and you tell me if that's a
[1:07:12] grade five education that's speaking
[1:07:15] through those tapes or if that isn't the
[1:07:17] the supernatural inspired Spirit of the
[1:07:20] Living God speaking through a
[1:07:23] man that was able to to to to bring
[1:07:26] truths and understanding on the churches
[1:07:28] and and the mysteries of God in such a
[1:07:31] way it had to be God that's why God will
[1:07:34] not lift up a man I don't care how many
[1:07:36] llds or phds a man has or how many times
[1:07:39] he's been to theological school that
[1:07:42] ain't going to get you any closer to God
[1:07:44] you need to be you need to repent get on
[1:07:47] your knees and pray that God reveals
[1:07:49] himself to you because it's when you
[1:07:51] meet God that everything changes praise
[1:07:54] God it's not about you going to Seminary
[1:07:57] school and trying to figure out God you
[1:07:59] can't figure out God praise God forever
[1:08:01] more and so if you go to the next Slide
[1:08:04] the reason why I brought this up is
[1:08:06] because if you look uh the Leo Dean
[1:08:10] Church age is supposed to be the
[1:08:11] shortest Church age and when you look at
[1:08:14] this and you look at Ephesus which was
[1:08:16] the
[1:08:18] shortest in comparison to the
[1:08:21] other six okay you'll see that it
[1:08:25] started in ad 53 and it ended in ad.
[1:08:28] 170 and that was 118 years and leod deia
[1:08:33] started in
[1:08:35] 1906 and if we add 118 years where do we
[1:08:39] end
[1:08:41] up
[1:08:43] today okay so what time are we living in
[1:08:47] and remember this was
[1:08:49] all God calling out a gentile church
[1:08:55] this is to the
[1:08:57] Gentiles this is not to the Muslim this
[1:09:00] is not now if there's a gentile in the
[1:09:02] Muslim that has the spirit of God and an
[1:09:05] attribute of God God brings them out of
[1:09:07] the Muslim and makes them a son or
[1:09:09] daughter and and and and identifies them
[1:09:11] as a son or a daughter of God you don't
[1:09:13] make Sons and Daughters you identify
[1:09:16] when you can recognize the word for your
[1:09:18] day there's a lot of Muslims that came
[1:09:21] out of that teaching and came right into
[1:09:24] this message and are Born Again
[1:09:26] Believers of this message amen there's
[1:09:29] Che there's there's churches in mus
[1:09:31] Muslim nations that believe exactly what
[1:09:34] what I'm preaching here this morning
[1:09:37] that have the same revelation of God
[1:09:39] that God sent a prophet in this day to
[1:09:41] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:09:43] the faith of the fathers and so when we
[1:09:45] look at that now I'm not saying that
[1:09:47] that that that oh the Rapture is going
[1:09:49] to happen this year I'm not saying that
[1:09:53] but could the Gentile dispensation be
[1:09:55] over
[1:09:57] could it be could it be that that that
[1:09:59] that sign of the
[1:10:01] Moon completely
[1:10:03] overshadowing the sun could that be a
[1:10:08] complete blackout again and could this
[1:10:12] be the one because you know there's not
[1:10:14] another one now until
[1:10:17] 2044 and so what what day are we living
[1:10:20] in what is it speaking to you what is it
[1:10:23] telling you what is it is it bringing
[1:10:25] you to to a place where you where where
[1:10:27] you recognize wait a minute here these
[1:10:29] things are actually happening this this
[1:10:33] the we're in
[1:10:34] 2024 I remember talking about this in in
[1:10:38] 2000 I remember sitting talking with
[1:10:41] brother Tim with other brothers we
[1:10:43] Fellowship around the word of God so oh
[1:10:45] boy the the year 2000 I wonder what's
[1:10:47] going to happen in the year 2000 but the
[1:10:49] one thing that was always in the back of
[1:10:51] my our minds was yeah but you know the
[1:10:53] prophet said that the Le Dean age you
[1:10:56] know uh we could still have another 24
[1:10:59] years and we thought oh man another 24
[1:11:05] years well here we are we are I don't
[1:11:09] know not remember what I said at the
[1:11:11] beginning I'm not saying this is going
[1:11:13] to happen that's G to I'm just G to tell
[1:11:16] you what God has laid upon my heart and
[1:11:19] what I'm going to express and and then
[1:11:21] and then the Lord he's his own
[1:11:23] interpreter he's going to make it plain
[1:11:25] let's continue on here listen uh uh I'm
[1:11:29] going to read a scripture
[1:11:32] here okay you can go to the next
[1:11:35] slide Matthew 16
[1:11:38] 3-4 the Pharisees also with the
[1:11:41] Sadducees came tempting desired him that
[1:11:46] he should that he would show them a sign
[1:11:48] from Heaven he answered and said unto
[1:11:51] them when it is evening you say it will
[1:11:54] be fair weather for the sky is red and
[1:11:57] in the morning it will be foul weather
[1:11:59] today for the sky is red and lowering oh
[1:12:03] ye Hypocrites you can discern the face
[1:12:06] of the sky but can ye not discern the
[1:12:09] signs of the
[1:12:11] times you know the people are looking to
[1:12:14] get an understanding of the signs o of
[1:12:17] the times and here it is it's right in
[1:12:19] front of them you walk into your your
[1:12:23] work and you're reading a uh you know a
[1:12:25] or you're listening to a message from
[1:12:27] last Sunday's service and and and you're
[1:12:29] rejoicing around the word of God and
[1:12:31] then you get so excited that you know
[1:12:33] you sit down to lunch and you want to
[1:12:35] tell them hey do you know what's going
[1:12:37] on did you know what happened over these
[1:12:39] last you know seven years we we had two
[1:12:41] total solar eclipses and did you know
[1:12:44] that God you know has has sent a a
[1:12:46] message in this day and and and to to
[1:12:49] recognize what's going on you see we're
[1:12:51] we're we're actually experiencing it but
[1:12:54] you know but but the people are just
[1:12:58] looking for signs but they don't they
[1:13:00] the answer is right there the an is in
[1:13:03] the word of God the answer is living in
[1:13:05] your life you you want them to listen to
[1:13:07] you but they won't even sit long enough
[1:13:09] to listen to the word of God and they
[1:13:13] want to just believe what they want to
[1:13:15] believe or they want to follow some you
[1:13:17] know some new age
[1:13:21] teaching he says discern the face of the
[1:13:24] guy but he cannot discern the signs of
[1:13:26] the time a wicked and adulterous
[1:13:28] generation seeketh after a sign and
[1:13:31] there shall no sign be given unto it but
[1:13:34] the sign of the prophet Jonah there it
[1:13:37] is again and he left them and
[1:13:40] departed the sign of the prophet Jonah
[1:13:43] now listen here brother Braham speaking
[1:13:45] a greater than Solomon is here he says
[1:13:47] now he referred to Jonah he's talking
[1:13:49] about the scripture that he just
[1:13:51] read and I believe that what he told
[1:13:54] Jonah he was speaking of this
[1:13:57] day he was actually speaking of this day
[1:14:01] God listen the Lord Jesus knew the
[1:14:03] timing but he didn't know when exactly
[1:14:07] he says that's all in the in the in the
[1:14:10] mind of the Father which is my spirit in
[1:14:15] its time and season everything is going
[1:14:17] to come to pass he knew the part that he
[1:14:21] was fulfilling right there and then he
[1:14:24] was in a human body he had to learn
[1:14:26] obedience to that human body he had to
[1:14:28] walk in a human body he had to be
[1:14:31] tempted the Bible says he was tempted
[1:14:33] just like any other man was tempted he
[1:14:36] did not know he said no that's all being
[1:14:39] left to the great Plan of Redemption
[1:14:42] that is already in the mind of God from
[1:14:44] before the foundations of the world but
[1:14:47] in his in his condition as as a son
[1:14:50] that's why he said I only do what the
[1:14:53] father shows me he realized that he was
[1:14:55] in a human body and he was limited to
[1:14:58] this human body he knew that he had to
[1:15:00] go to Calvary to and and actually die in
[1:15:04] order for his Spirit to be released
[1:15:07] back to go back to the father okay and
[1:15:11] so remember people say that you know
[1:15:14] yeah but Jesus the father up in heaven
[1:15:16] Jesus on Earth no God had a plan so he
[1:15:20] created himself a body called the name
[1:15:23] of the body Jesus
[1:15:25] so that it could be filled with his
[1:15:27] Spirit to go to Calvary to take our
[1:15:29] place and you are in a human body right
[1:15:32] now and you can only see what you can
[1:15:37] see because of this Veil that you're
[1:15:39] that that that you're in now you see in
[1:15:42] part but when you when you're changed
[1:15:45] into your Immortal body you shall see
[1:15:48] yourself as you actually are that's the
[1:15:50] same type as Jesus and us here in these
[1:15:53] human bodies that's why we can only see
[1:15:56] what we can see and what God reveals to
[1:15:59] us we're limited by this human Veil that
[1:16:03] we're trapped in amen and so here he
[1:16:06] says I believe that that he told Jonah
[1:16:09] he was speaking of this day now he said
[1:16:12] they were seeking a sign and they would
[1:16:14] get a sign the sign of the
[1:16:17] Resurrection that's the sign that's here
[1:16:21] now we are filled with the spirit of of
[1:16:25] God and we've been
[1:16:27] resurrected by a new birth out of our
[1:16:30] spiritual Amnesia that we were that we
[1:16:33] came in under our natural birth because
[1:16:36] when you're naturally born you come
[1:16:39] through a human vessel and there's blood
[1:16:42] there's water and then you get filled
[1:16:44] with your soul which is the spirit all
[1:16:46] all three the soul the spirit and you
[1:16:49] know the blood the spirit and the water
[1:16:50] right all all three it's a type and here
[1:16:53] when you come into the Dimension you
[1:16:56] come into these human bodies and you go
[1:16:58] through what's called spiritual Amnesia
[1:17:00] you actually don't know who you are
[1:17:03] until you come into the new birth amen
[1:17:05] that's why Jesus said you must be born
[1:17:09] again a child is the Bi Bible says born
[1:17:12] in sin shaped in iniquity speaking lies
[1:17:18] so how can you take a baby and baptize
[1:17:21] it and and say that's that's it it's
[1:17:23] Justified it's been bapt AP ized never
[1:17:25] needs to be baptized doesn't need to
[1:17:27] repent doesn't need to actually fulfill
[1:17:32] or obey the word of God it's a lie it's
[1:17:35] a lie of the enemy every individual must
[1:17:39] be born again by the word of God by a
[1:17:43] supernatural experience by meeting God
[1:17:46] face to face and know that you've come
[1:17:49] in contact with the word of God Amen
[1:17:52] praise God and so for Jo
[1:17:55] was in the belly of the whale for three
[1:17:57] days and three nights the son of man
[1:17:58] shall be in the heart of the Earth for
[1:18:00] three days and nights and then the
[1:18:02] resurrection would be the sign to the
[1:18:05] wicked and adulterous generation anyone
[1:18:09] knows that scripture has a compound
[1:18:11] meaning and history repeats itself do
[1:18:13] you believe scripture has a compound
[1:18:16] meaning all right take where it's this
[1:18:19] one here just comes in my mind where in
[1:18:21] Matthew chapter 3 it said out of Egypt
[1:18:24] called my son run the reference to that
[1:18:27] and see if it didn't mean
[1:18:29] Jacob certainly it did Jacob God's son
[1:18:33] it meant Jesus God's son it has a
[1:18:36] compound prophecy many times has it and
[1:18:40] so I believe that we've come back to a
[1:18:43] wicked and an adulterous generation and
[1:18:46] this generation has to receive the sign
[1:18:49] of the
[1:18:50] Resurrection to Dove tail with my first
[1:18:54] first night's sermon the signs that he
[1:18:58] did then he's never done them since in
[1:19:02] all the age until the closing of the
[1:19:06] Gentile
[1:19:07] dispensation listen the closing of the
[1:19:10] Gentile dispensation started with
[1:19:13] William Mariam
[1:19:15] Branham the closing it started with that
[1:19:19] it's going to end with the bride of
[1:19:22] Jesus Christ the brides Ministry she
[1:19:25] will close out the Gentile dispensation
[1:19:29] she will be the last and final voice to
[1:19:33] this Gentile generation and it's saying
[1:19:36] the same thing turn and come back to the
[1:19:40] word come back to God you you're you're
[1:19:43] you're in denominational uh teachings
[1:19:45] you're under the teachings of man you
[1:19:48] need to come and be born again
[1:19:51] personally by a personal revelation of
[1:19:54] Jesus Jesus Christ you and
[1:19:57] God hallelujah praise God Amen he's
[1:20:01] never done them since in all ages until
[1:20:04] the closing of the Gentiles dispensation
[1:20:06] that we're now living in and this wicked
[1:20:09] and adulterous and Christ rejecting
[1:20:11] generation has received the sign of the
[1:20:14] Resurrection The Last sign to be given
[1:20:17] to the church praise God hallelujah
[1:20:21] listen when brother Brenham went off the
[1:20:23] scene the Mighty Angel himself came down

[1:20:43] right start your message with the end in
[1:20:46] mind I can't get the end out of my mind
[1:20:49] because the end in my mind is the spirit
[1:20:52] of God and the Revelation that he gave
[1:20:54] me that's stirring my heart and that's
[1:20:56] given me the inspiration to say all that
[1:20:59] I'm saying and to do all that I'm doing
[1:21:02] listen I'm I'm just a man I'm telling

[1:21:45] this church I looked at him and I and I
[1:21:48] and I would come into the into the
[1:21:50] services with expectation in my heart

[1:23:25] place and and so let's just continue on

[1:24:58] didn't allow any thought to come into my
[1:25:00] mind until he started to drop thoughts

[1:26:40] and they shall see the son of man coming
[1:26:43] in the Clouds Of Heaven with power and
[1:26:48] great
[1:26:49] Glory now we're going to be looking at
[1:26:52] here in the next half an hour
[1:26:55] there's no way we're going to get
[1:26:56] through all of this okay there's just
[1:26:59] way too much but please be
[1:27:02] patient go back you know after we get
[1:27:07] through it relisten to it again draw
[1:27:10] from it and and get into the anointing
[1:27:14] and the atmosphere of what God is
[1:27:15] revealing to us praise God now first of
[1:27:20] all as before I go into all of this I
[1:27:22] want to acknowledge brother Pastor Chad
[1:27:25] Lamb back in
[1:27:28] 2014 he brought a message what is the
[1:27:31] attraction on the mountain the Lord led
[1:27:32] him to bring a message on the cloud and
[1:27:37] he brought it and I listened to that I
[1:27:39] remember when I listened to it like 10
[1:27:41] years ago for the first time and I
[1:27:43] thought wow I was
[1:27:46] rejoicing praise God because the Lord
[1:27:48] anointed him at a time where there was
[1:27:51] an attack on the cloud and on the mess
[1:27:54] message of the hour because the enemy
[1:27:56] was attacking like crazy at that time
[1:28:00] and it's interesting because when I
[1:28:01] listen to the message this week right at
[1:28:03] the end of the service brother Chad goes
[1:28:06] into uh how Israel is under a great
[1:28:09] attack right now how he was talking
[1:28:12] about how Hamas had had built all these
[1:28:14] underground tunnels and and and all of
[1:28:17] this was going on and Israel was was
[1:28:19] standing on the word of God and the
[1:28:21] enemy was trying to infiltrate their
[1:28:23] their their their land trying to
[1:28:25] infiltrate and he was he was typing it
[1:28:27] to the body of Christ and saying how the
[1:28:29] enemy is trying to infiltrate and turn
[1:28:31] us back trying to turn us away from our
[1:28:34] faith by by by giving us battles and by
[1:28:37] hitting us here and hitting us there and
[1:28:40] and and infiltrating with with lying
[1:28:42] Spirits coming up and saying oh the
[1:28:44] cloud was just some you know some that
[1:28:47] that came off of a off of a jet and and
[1:28:50] it and it moved and the and the and the
[1:28:52] smoke and they came up with all kinds of
[1:28:54] different interpretations on what it
[1:28:57] could have been I'm saying to you we're
[1:28:59] going to look at it now we're g to we're
[1:29:00] going to be reminded of it all and we're
[1:29:02] going to see how perfect God is and then
[1:29:05] we're going to see how it's pertains to
[1:29:07] our day and how it's now in progress and
[1:29:10] how it's bringing us to this day because
[1:29:12] that's what that's what I'm excited
[1:29:14] about that's what's that that's what's
[1:29:16] stirring in my heart on how this is all
[1:29:19] progressing and bringing us to the day
[1:29:21] that we're in and so I want to give him
[1:29:25] uh acknowledgement on that the Lord
[1:29:28] inspired him and used him in a in a
[1:29:30] miraculous way to bring out a lot of the
[1:29:33] of the facts that I'm going to bring to
[1:29:35] you scripturally and uh so uh praise God
[1:29:38] for that but then there's something in
[1:29:40] it for you there's something in it for
[1:29:43] you if you can catch my mind and and and
[1:29:46] and the mind of the Lord and in what
[1:29:48] he's revealed here and get into it and
[1:29:51] pay attention you will catch what what
[1:29:53] what the spirit of God is trying to say
[1:29:55] to us remember the final voice the final
[1:29:59] voice we're listening for that voice and
[1:30:02] the voice and where and wherever Christ
[1:30:04] is that's where the voice is amen praise
[1:30:07] God and so every sign from God has a
[1:30:11] scriptural Vindication and a scriptural
[1:30:14] voice to that sign the cloud sign and
[1:30:17] the voice of that sign and so in 1962
[1:30:22] here uh in this
[1:30:24] the the sign is this the sign of the
[1:30:26] answer brother brandom he says look then
[1:30:30] look to the Capstone was not interpreted
[1:30:33] see now this is one year and a couple of
[1:30:37] months
[1:30:38] before sorry this is uh no uh a couple
[1:30:42] of months three months it was February
[1:30:44] the 28th 1963 that the cloud actually
[1:30:48] came down on Sunset mountain and here we
[1:30:51] are two months before it actually took
[1:30:53] place and brother brandham speaking here
[1:30:55] so I want you to see here that God had
[1:30:57] already shown him what was going to be
[1:31:00] coming remember William brandham was a
[1:31:03] Vindicated prophet of God people need to
[1:31:05] know that they need to go back and study
[1:31:08] his ministry and catch and pay attention
[1:31:11] and actually and actually pray and ask
[1:31:15] the Lord to show them what what what is
[1:31:17] actually taking place through that
[1:31:19] Ministry because to miss his ministry
[1:31:22] you'll miss this right it's just like
[1:31:25] Luther if listen the Lutheran Church
[1:31:28] would not exist today had they not
[1:31:30] accepted Luther as their Messenger right
[1:31:33] do you understand they would not have
[1:31:35] been able to progress from Luther unto
[1:31:38] Wesley they call it the great
[1:31:39] Reformation all the churches believe in
[1:31:41] that all the Protestant churches believe
[1:31:44] in that you go back and talk about
[1:31:45] Wesley they'll tell oh yeah Wesley the
[1:31:47] Presbyterian movement this that you know
[1:31:50] the Anglican oh yeah that was all
[1:31:51] progression of the word this and that
[1:31:53] and then you tell them about Pentecost
[1:31:55] and they go yeah yeah you talk to the
[1:31:56] Pentecostals they'll tell you oh yeah we
[1:31:58] recognize Pentecostal that was the
[1:32:00] spirit of God coming down and filling
[1:32:02] the church with his Spirit and the gifts
[1:32:04] were being brought into the church and
[1:32:06] and and and God was restoring his his
[1:32:09] anointing and and the supernatural
[1:32:11] speaking in tongues and they took that
[1:32:13] as the as the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:32:15] but then God sends another messenger
[1:32:18] William Mariam Branham and he's got a
[1:32:21] prophetic Ministry on him he's got a
[1:32:23] prophet phcy of Malachi 4:5 and
[1:32:25] Revelations 10 1-7 written all over his
[1:32:29] life and he comes to fulfill that
[1:32:31] portion of the
[1:32:33] word and so here now he's he's he's he
[1:32:37] catches this message and he's revealing
[1:32:38] it to the people he says now look the
[1:32:40] Capstone was not interpreted see get
[1:32:44] West and come back or it's this it's
[1:32:47] these seven angels in this constellation
[1:32:51] that came to me and when I meet meet you
[1:32:54] at the day of the Resurrection you'll
[1:32:57] see that I lie not listen he had visions
[1:33:02] and he would get caught into those
[1:33:03] visions and for for third for how many
[1:33:06] 20 30 years every single Vision that he
[1:33:10] had never failed
[1:33:14] once when he saw somebody healed they
[1:33:18] were healed when he saw the dead baby
[1:33:21] come back to life in the woman's arms
[1:33:23] and in his arms it came back to life in
[1:33:26] his arms because God showed him the
[1:33:28] vision and so why he says I lie not is
[1:33:32] because you need to realize that every
[1:33:34] single Vision that God ever gave him
[1:33:37] came to pass not because he wanted it to
[1:33:41] come to pass he'd be he'd go into a
[1:33:43] person's home they had one day to live
[1:33:47] and the person would come and say
[1:33:49] brother Brandon please come and pray for
[1:33:50] for for for brother so and so he's got
[1:33:53] like one day live her sister so and so
[1:33:55] the doctor said they're going to die
[1:33:56] tomorrow he says okay okay let's go I'll
[1:34:00] go there and I'll lay my hands and I'll
[1:34:02] pray over the person and he go there and
[1:34:04] he pray over that person and and and
[1:34:06] he'd say well there's nothing more I can
[1:34:08] do and then as he's walking out of the
[1:34:10] room boom there's the vision right in
[1:34:12] front of him and he sees the person or
[1:34:15] the woman going into the supermarket
[1:34:18] buying some
[1:34:19] groceries he stops and he goes wait a
[1:34:22] minute he says thus sayeth the Lord
[1:34:25] she'll not die she'll be buying
[1:34:28] groceries again or going here or going
[1:34:30] there and the next day that person is up
[1:34:34] breakfast eating their
[1:34:36] breakfast he knew that any time God
[1:34:40] showed him a vision like that it would
[1:34:42] not fail period so here he's now talking
[1:34:45] about a constellation of angels that
[1:34:47] would come to him and when I meet you on
[1:34:50] that day he says you'll know I didn't
[1:34:51] lie God is my judge or this or is this
[1:34:56] that second climax that I talked about
[1:34:58] the other day is it of something coming
[1:35:01] forth for the church so God was doing
[1:35:05] something in that day for the
[1:35:08] church God is doing something in our day
[1:35:12] for the church we are the church he's
[1:35:16] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:35:18] he's going to do things for us that are
[1:35:21] going to give us Faith Like We Never Had
[1:35:23] had
[1:35:24] before we need rapturing Faith Saints we
[1:35:29] you're not going to go just on on
[1:35:30] stories listen I can tell you all about
[1:35:32] this you can read all about it but you
[1:35:34] need to get into the anointing and the
[1:35:36] Revelation that's behind that Jesus
[1:35:38] Christ is the same yesterday today he
[1:35:42] wants to do something for you today he
[1:35:45] listen you can leave here today with a
[1:35:47] healing you can leave with a W with a
[1:35:50] changed heart your your mind can be
[1:35:52] transformed your heart can be turned
[1:35:55] back to God if your back's sliding out
[1:35:56] there come back to God because God can
[1:35:59] turn you back around and change
[1:36:03] everything because he's here now he
[1:36:05] wants this to become now reality amen
[1:36:09] and so I don't know he says is it of
[1:36:12] something coming forth for the church he
[1:36:14] says I don't know I could stay on it a
[1:36:16] little bit but I'll move on could it be
[1:36:18] that the mighty Thunder or the seven a
[1:36:21] the seventh angel in the in the seven
[1:36:24] the the constellation seventh period
[1:36:28] constellation their pyramid made in the
[1:36:30] form three on one side three on the
[1:36:33] other one on top brother brandham saw
[1:36:35] the constellation of angels it's it
[1:36:39] that's what came down and and met him
[1:36:41] but it was a at that point this was only
[1:36:43] a vision he hadn't experienced it yet he
[1:36:46] experienced it on February the 28th
[1:36:50] 1963 he says their pyramid made the form
[1:36:53] he says he says and they dropped from
[1:36:57] eternity they came out of nowhere in a
[1:37:00] split second he described it these are
[1:37:03] actual events that took place and he
[1:37:05] says could it be is this the mystery of
[1:37:08] the Thunders that will bring back The
[1:37:10] Headstone right The Headstone he says
[1:37:14] you know the pyramid never was capped
[1:37:17] The Headstone Is Yet To Come he knew
[1:37:20] that God was going to fulfill the the a
[1:37:23] portion of the word he realized that he
[1:37:25] was walking in the prophecy of the
[1:37:27] Fulfillment but he had no idea of just
[1:37:30] how wonderful it was going to be how
[1:37:33] much was actually going to happen I'm
[1:37:35] telling you you can be under great
[1:37:37] expectation because you're going to
[1:37:39] you're you're going to experiencing
[1:37:40] rapturing Faith things are going to
[1:37:42] happen around your life things are going
[1:37:45] to change from this day on things are
[1:37:47] going to change around your life if you
[1:37:49] allow this word to become a reality to
[1:37:51] you amen praise God he says The
[1:37:54] Headstone hadn't yet come it been
[1:37:56] rejected could it be brothers sisters
[1:37:59] and then he goes on he says where's it
[1:38:01] where is he King of the Jews now watch
[1:38:03] he says God always God shows it by
[1:38:07] Heavenly
[1:38:10] signs since when did he ever do anything
[1:38:15] that he didn't show a Heavenly sign
[1:38:19] first think of it in every age that you
[1:38:22] wish to
[1:38:24] and God always does show signs in the
[1:38:27] heaven first before he does anything on
[1:38:30] Earth it comes from the
[1:38:32] supernatural drops into the natural and
[1:38:35] is made manifest every age every time
[1:38:41] what age are we in we're in the bright
[1:38:44] age this is the age where we
[1:38:48] experience our Cloud experience our
[1:38:53] Supernatural change our rapturing faith
[1:38:57] our new Bible this Bible is becoming new
[1:39:00] again it's becoming new again to me I
[1:39:03] I'm reading the scriptures and I'm
[1:39:04] seeing things in there that I never saw
[1:39:06] before why because he's Progressive he's
[1:39:09] Progressive in the revelation of the
[1:39:12] change and what's taking place in our
[1:39:14] lives and he's not going to leave us in
[1:39:16] the same condition a lot of us are
[1:39:18] discouraged we're in we're in we're in
[1:39:21] conditions we're wondering why this is
[1:39:22] going on why that's going on why is this
[1:39:24] relationship a mess why is that
[1:39:26] happening why is my finan in a mess why
[1:39:29] because all these things are taking
[1:39:31] place around us so that God can become a
[1:39:34] reality to you so that you get to a
[1:39:37] place where you make God first you place
[1:39:40] him first in every situation and then
[1:39:42] you watch if God doesn't come on the
[1:39:44] scene and supernaturally change things
[1:39:47] the same way that he did it for the
[1:39:49] prophet I want the god of brother
[1:39:51] brandham I want the same God that was
[1:39:53] with brother brandham to come and
[1:39:55] intercede in my life deal with my home
[1:39:57] deal with my children deal with my
[1:39:59] finance deal with my my my my health I
[1:40:03] want that same God today amen I believe
[1:40:05] that he's present he's here and he wants
[1:40:08] to do
[1:40:09] it amen praise
[1:40:12] God let's go to the next
[1:40:14] slide that was a picture that you know
[1:40:17] one of the pictures that were that that
[1:40:19] were taken there was there was almost 85
[1:40:22] different pictures
[1:40:23] that were taken from all different parts
[1:40:26] of of of Arizona and other parts of the
[1:40:29] US where you know they saw it in
[1:40:30] different ways and this was you know and
[1:40:33] here you can see that it was just you
[1:40:35] know and this was actually when it was
[1:40:37] when it when it was coming this is
[1:40:39] actually the cloud you know a lot of
[1:40:41] people thought it was when it was
[1:40:42] leaving but it was actually when it was
[1:40:43] coming and it was coming down it was
[1:40:46] coming from one part of America over to
[1:40:48] the other side of America and it was
[1:40:50] coming at a speed of I I believe they
[1:40:52] said it was like going at around 95
[1:40:55] mph and it and it was a supernatural
[1:40:57] Cloud it was at a height and a level
[1:41:00] that not even missed because there was
[1:41:02] all kinds of different uh you know
[1:41:05] um writeups on it and you know you know
[1:41:08] we'll look at that now go to the next
[1:41:14] slide now listen to brother brand here
[1:41:17] he
[1:41:18] says and you know not in that time I
[1:41:22] didn't know it but cameras from all over
[1:41:26] the country was taking the picture of
[1:41:29] that as the White Cloud settled down
[1:41:32] went on the Associated Press I think
[1:41:35] your Chicago paper packed it all around
[1:41:39] and Life Magazine picked it up now
[1:41:43] here's where I want you to be paying
[1:41:45] attention to all the all the other
[1:41:47] little things that that surround this

[1:42:12] this the sign of the Ender 1962 he says
[1:42:16] when when the light which you see on the
[1:42:18] picture tonight that's been proven to be
[1:42:21] a supernatural being but by scientific
[1:42:24] research to me it was the same light
[1:42:27] that struck down St Paul it was the same
[1:42:31] light that led the children of Israel by
[1:42:33] night did you notice here this Angel he
[1:42:36] was clothed in a cloud see he was a
[1:42:40] cloud by day now that same

[1:42:56] right now before we go to that let's
[1:42:58] just go to the next slide I was going to
[1:43:00] tell you that Science magazine picked up
[1:43:06] an article and wrote on it in April of
[1:43:09] 1963 now remember this happened in

[1:44:26] uh here brother Bram talks about he says
[1:44:29] okay so and the other day standing there
[1:44:31] turn the picture to the right and there
[1:44:34] is Jesus as he was in the seven Church
[1:44:38] ages the white wig on showing Supreme
[1:44:42] deity he's Alpha and Omega he's the
[1:44:44] first and the last he is the Supreme
[1:44:47] judge of all eternity standing there
[1:44:49] confirm the message of this hour see
[1:44:52] that that cloud when it came down it was
[1:44:55] God coming to confirm Not only was it
[1:44:59] God coming down to to the The Headstone
[1:45:02] the the Capstone coming down to join
[1:45:04] with the body of Christ but it was God
[1:45:07] vindicating through a supernatural sign
[1:45:10] that the whole world was going to get uh
[1:45:14] witness of because this magazine was a
[1:45:17] very popular magazine all
[1:45:19] across America at the time and God
[1:45:23] placed it there and here now we're going
[1:45:25] to go
[1:45:28] on
[1:45:31] okay and we're going to look
[1:45:33] now and we're going to realize some of
[1:45:37] these facts that I'm going to bring to
[1:45:38] you right now now first of
[1:45:41] all these these uh uh Ministries Moses
[1:45:46] and brother brandham okay Moses and
[1:45:50] Elijah okay those two Ministries keep
[1:45:54] that in the back of your mind okay those
[1:45:57] two Ministries were very very similar
[1:46:00] almost exactly the same okay the
[1:46:03] ministry of William brandham was a
[1:46:05] perfect type of the Moses Ministry God
[1:46:10] met Moses on a mountain God meets
[1:46:13] William brandom on a mountain okay God
[1:46:17] gives Moses three signs God gives
[1:46:20] brother brandham three signs okay you
[1:46:23] need to see the the this is just to
[1:46:25] vindicate that what has taken place here
[1:46:29] actually took place and it's a reality
[1:46:31] and we need to see it clear okay and
[1:46:35] here now uh here God sends Moses to
[1:46:38] bring a people that are in bondage for
[1:46:41] 400 years and now God sends a people uh
[1:46:45] sends a prophet to a people here in the
[1:46:48] Gentiles to call them out of bondage
[1:46:50] that they've been under for hundreds of
[1:46:52] years
[1:46:53] out of denominational bondage to bring
[1:46:56] us back to the word of God back to our
[1:46:59] original Faith so that we could so that
[1:47:02] we could actually be be be transformed
[1:47:04] and have a real experience a Christian
[1:47:07] experience of the word of God okay God
[1:47:11] now listen Moses goes to receive the Ten
[1:47:14] Commandments and God came to him on the
[1:47:17] seventh day William brandom was the
[1:47:20] Fulfillment of Revelations 10
[1:47:24] seven okay so Ten Commandments the law
[1:47:27] which is a representation of the law and
[1:47:30] seven was the seventh angel messenger
[1:47:33] completion God was coming to restore now
[1:47:36] his word and to give us h a revelation
[1:47:40] of what he was doing at that particular
[1:47:43] time leading up to this day and so we
[1:47:47] okay I'm not going to get into all the
[1:47:50] the the the the similarities and the
[1:47:52] type
[1:47:53] but you need to just see that these two
[1:47:56] uh Moses and Elijah they're they're
[1:47:58] significant because they actually come
[1:48:00] again okay and what we want to see here
[1:48:04] is how the Lord scripturally and now
[1:48:08] numerically vindicates William branham's
[1:48:10] Ministry the cloud appearance and the
[1:48:13] supernatural Vindication of the
[1:48:15] cloud in Matthew 24:30 we read that that
[1:48:20] there shall appear a sign of the son of
[1:48:22] man and then in Revelations 17 to8
[1:48:25] behold he cometh with clouds and every
[1:48:28] eye shall see him and they also which
[1:48:31] pierced him and all the kindreds of the
[1:48:33] Earth shall well because of him even so
[1:48:36] amen I am Alpha and Omega the beginning
[1:48:39] and the ending sayeth the Lord which is
[1:48:41] and which was and which is to come the
[1:48:45] almighty okay now did you manage to get
[1:48:49] the other file
[1:48:53] okay good we're going to look now okay
[1:48:56] now listen to brother brandham here the
[1:48:58] end time sign seed we're going to we're
[1:49:00] going to end
[1:49:03] this now we're going to have to because
[1:49:07] now this goes

[1:49:32] them just now we'll just end it with
[1:49:34] this we know that God's God's got
[1:49:36] perfect numbers listen to brother bam he
[1:49:38] says here three is the number of
[1:49:39] perfection we all know that three is
[1:49:43] God's number in numerology God is known
