TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hallelujah and praise the lord may the lord richly bless you what a privilege what an honor to address the sons and daughters of the living god now today we continue in our wonderful study of the seven church ages and my topic for tonight will be cain the son of satan may the holy spirit bless us together as the we open up the word of god and see these glorious hidden truths unveiled from the word of god let us read our scriptures and pray first john chapter 3 verses 11 and 12. for this is the message that we have heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works are were evil and his brothers righteous god bless us together as we look to the word of god now we understand starting now that god had this glorious plan of redemption and the plan of redemption is for his glory and a testament to his love mercy and grace now this plan of redemption was a plan and is a plan of salvation now god being a savior to bring salvation he must be a savior and for god to be a savior it was necessary that he would predestinated a man who would require salvation in order to manifest his attribute of being a savior he must have a reason and a purpose for doing so now we find friends that uh first of all that's the reason why man uh had to be made manifested in the flesh but we will talk about that later he was manifest in the flesh so that he could sin for if he remained in his original form in the mind of god he could not sin for the seed of god do not commit sin and while he was in god he could not sin so god had to allow man to come to earth and be imprisoned now in a a temple or a veil of flesh so that he could sin and then god knowingful well of course that uh that god could then manifest his attribute his character as being a redeemer a savior a great and mighty god and so we thank him for his love and that we can now clearly see the very purpose and reason for the being of god for god being god god being a savior god being a healer god being a baptizer saving his people and then taking them out and being our soon-coming king that will rapture us out of here by his divine grace now in the book of romans chapter 11 it tells us for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever and ever amen praise the lord so we understand god gave his command that man was not to touch the tree of good and evil and he could not partake right then of the tree of life you see eternal life had to become flesh first then man in flesh see man in that state then could approach the tree of life praise god so before god could save a sinner he had to raise place one that he could save a one that he could receive to himself so man had to fall and man because man had to fall man had to be in flesh to be able to fall now the plan of redemption is of god and god being god had to get in flesh to be able to save man man had to get in the flesh so that he could fall so that god could save him now satan also had his plan whereby he would get into flesh but that is to cross the fall and to cause man to sin not knowing that god already had a hidden plan of salvation by which he would save man and deliver him from satan's truth praise be to god hallelujah now satan could not come true flesh the way god could come true flesh god came true flesh by his spoken word the word spoken to mary creating a cell in our womb and thereby a pregnancy which produced that holy person that holy thing jesus christ upon the face of the earth satan being a creature no matter how he tries to deceive you he was create he is a created being he's a creature he is corrupt he is evil in every way and because being a creature he will come to his end but the endless god of eternal life could speak his creative word and create a body as son that he might the father may dwell in the sun god becoming flesh for the word became flesh praise god hallelujah the word god spoke became flesh and walked among us praise god hallelujah now we understand praise god that there was the only animal that was close enough to man that satan could get into indwell as i spoke of last time and used them and through that beast he then could get himself into human flesh by his high breathing by the crossing of the species by climbing over a wall by crossing over the boundaries that god hath placed there he would come into human flesh and crossed the fall by injecting himself into the human race and into human bodies even to the extent of a resurrection thank god that jesus christ placed himself also in flesh so that by being in flesh he could raise up and show us show the true believer that they will be raised up also even though being in flesh and he would bring about the rapture the resurrection and take us out of here i want to thank god for jesus christ what he has done and what he is doing at this present time now satan getting into that beast that serpent still maintained his vicious uh character so he was vicious and poisonous even in the form of a serpent or of a poisonous snake after the curse is so cruel so bitter so wicked suicidal that in his anger in the poisonous venomous hatred that he spews he bit his own tail he outsmarted his own self and became a pawn in god's plan for as you know satan really can do nothing unless god takes his hands off and allows him to do it which it will fit right back into god's plan now god worked out his own plan and it started right before the foundation of the world down into the garden and then his predestinated plan began to come into view now satan actually as you know death killed itself on golgotha it was so blinded that he bit his own tail and destroyed himself and god used that that part of his nature his anger his evil for jesus became sin he became sin and death so that death will kill in killing jesus he destroyed sin he destroyed death because jesus became sin and death for us he became all those things that we may live again for his glory and for his honor oh thanks be unto god for this marvelous and wonderful gift that has been restored unto us oh praise god beloved now are we the sons of god and what a grace what a glory what an anointing that god has given us as his children now since man in the garden my sin could not get to that tree of life we find that because it wasn't a time of course an animal had caused the fall a beast had crossed the fall and we know when god gave out the judgment he crossed the ground he cursed the woman and he cursed the beast he cursed that serpent and from there we have the principle that animals caused the fall and because of this then animal blood had to be shed and his blood given was the substitute of man being able to have fellowship back with god again but there was to come a day when jesus would become sin or the serpent on moses's pole and that being sin becoming sin satan would destroy the very thing that he brought about to bring the end of man and the fall of man and god would use he himself to destroy it oh praise be to god the wisdom and the knowledge of god hallelujah and so he appeared jesus appeared in flesh for the humiliation of man and by this restored fallen man by standing in the gap so that a man will again become a partaker or partakers of the word of god the revealed word the tree of life praise be to god hallelujah now in the bible then we understand friends that we will be able to see clearly this scheme of the devil of using the serpent seed everyone will understand that the fruit of that woman was not her eating an apple the fruit was cane amen now here it is friends now what uh if eve fell that way what did adam do and why was he cast out the garden let us search out that in the word of god now we find friends that god laid the blame on adam for in the final analysis he was the man that got placed in the garden she came from him and he was responsible for her to protect her to pro preserve her in every possible way now of course we know the bible teaches us clearly that a woman that leaves her husband and goes and have knowledge with another man the bible says she shall be called an adulteress and she is no longer married amen and that husband really has not to take her back but in the bible adam did take her back you see adam did take her back because in and when he took her back he knew what he was doing for in him being our representation our representative and the entire human race being in him like the first oak tree all the oak trees that ever have come upon the earth all came out from the original one and all of us came out originally from the original man adam that was there so when he did that he knew what he was doing praise god she was a part of him oh thank god hallelujah that we are a part of the word we are a part of christ but she was a part of him and there she was but he was willing to take her uh foibles and failures take responsibility in other words upon himself because he loved her so much that he would not let her go oh my friends let me think of it the love of god the love of jesus christ for us that even though we have sinned we have failed him we have fallen in every possible way he loved us with a love that would not let us go oh may we come as the songwriters say and rest our weary souls in him for his love is deeper and greater far than any tongue can tell thanks be to god for that kind of a love now the bible tells us that eve conceived by adam he knew that she would he knew exactly what would happen in the human race by that and this is now the origin of slavery and by this he sold the human race into the slavery of sin and from from that every other form of slavery whether it be slavery to chemicals whether it be slavery uh human slavery whatever uh it all originated right there in the garden in your bible when he saw the entire human race into this slavery of sin that he might have eve and love her with all of his heart now that's what adam knew he was well aware praise god now from her two sons were born sons that would be the fathers of the human race that was even now polluted by high breeding by the mixture and mixing of these two different seeds or pity some people who have no understanding of high breeding uh it doesn't matter they're looking at colors they're looking at races they're looking at cultures they're looking at that and that's not the high breeding because the entire human race is one race amen praise god and so here we are the record tells us jude chapter 14 enoch also the seventh from adam and genesis 5 of course is the genealogy of enlock and it gives the genealogy as such read it for yourself you'll find cain is not mentioned in there e adam set is not mentioned in adam's genealogy and he is not mentioned for he is not the son of adam he was the son of the serpent the son of the devil this son of satan that was now injected in the human race if cain was not the son of adam whose son was he he was of the son of that wicked one your answer is in our text that we read earlier today tonight the son of that wicked one who slew his brother the reason that we know that cain had to be a son of satan the son of that evil one first by his the very nature that he displays displaying the nature immediately at the beginning of the world oh my he is made manifest as a murderer of his own brother then manifested as a liar where is thy brother i don't know when he absolutely knew that he killed him he knew where he left him or buried him put him under the ground whatever he did it but uh i don't know a lie so a murderer from the beginning a liar from the beginning and his very nature displayed he was not the son of adam secondly he was not in adam's genealogy by law of the birthright the eldest or the oldest son should inherit the blessings which is what satan was trying to insert himself to do but far be it from god and the wisdom of god he is not even mentioned in adam's genealogy he was not worthy to receive the inheritance he was not qualified to receive that inheritance because he was not the son of adam he was the son of satan the son of the devil now praise god listen genesis 5 3 adam lived 130 years and begot a son in his own likeness and after his image and called his name set now the third reason we know he was not adam's son he was not in adam's likeness he was not born in adam's image and any man knows that he would love to look upon his child and see some of his likeness some of his image reflected in the child for the scripture is that every seed shall bring forth after its kind in this case it was not so when adam looked upon him course he knew that this was not his child it was not his son oh my there it was this evil thing had reared its head within the garden of god by the love reproduction we see it by the law of genealogy we can see it oh praise god hallelujah and if you want to check the genealogy of adam check it in genesis check it again in the gospel of luke and nowhere will you find the name of cain mentioned as being a son of adam ins it does not say anything of that nature but it does say in first john cain who was the son of that wicked one he was of that wicked one that was his origin that was his gene his evil warp perverted evil gene was straight from the mind and loins of satan who got into the serpent and used him to inject himself into the entire human race now we find out friends that this one when we apply this we can see that even cain's approach to worship it alienated him from god he thought he could make god love him by building a great altar a high altar and place gold and brass and flowers and silver and and maybe he had some smoke from his sacrifice incense and that would endear him to god but that was not god's way that was not the correct approach to god which was given to abel by revelation and god gives that to his seed today by revelation yes worship everywhere all naming the name of adam the second adam all naming the name of christ all saying that came from adam but really no oh praise god by revelation one is of adam and one is a son of the devil and we recognize this by the testing of the word of god by his flamboyance by his way of worship by his programming he is revealing that he is not of god and his way his nature is not of god for it's contrary to the word of god so we see two lines two seeds two vines growing side by side one taking another to be left but here it is my friends that this line that we see of cain with its great ceremony and pomp and flamboyance and show and programs to capture by sound by sight by feeling by by these outer senses of the body rather than being captured by the revelation of the word of god making itself plain and so we see two lines we see the godly line flowing through sets for enoch was caught up to the presence of almighty god and we see the ungodly line founded by cain oh praise god hallelujah cain was a different kind of person than a bell and set for they were born of the adopt spiritual line oh glory to god oh hallelujah king really should have been spiritual and adam abell less and so on down the line that's the way he thought it would be but it wasn't like that and we find since sin came in every generation has gotten further and further away from god by time and by revelation of the word of god we are further away from god than mankind has ever been but while that is happening in time while that is happening by the flesh the spirit which is timeless worthless and deathless for the true child of god they are closer than they ever were before as the world is being made known to them and they're coming into a deeper spiritual walk on awareness with god so that they can say i and my father are one i am one with him in him and i walk with him alone glory to god hallelujah amen yes sir we find friends it's the same today that the wicked is wicked and violently will withstand the word of god for the owl we know the scripture does not play with words and god has a purpose with everything he says genesis 3 20 adam called his wife's name eve because she was the mother of all living oh praise god amen that genesis 3 20 eve the mother of all but no word about adam being the father of all the entire human race for adam was not the father of all living the serpent's seed began to disperse itself all over the entire earth genesis 4 1 eve said i have gotten a man from the lord what if she deceiving her own self and deceiving the rest of the world trying to say that cain uh she got it from the lord when she got it from satan she got all these memberships this great big churches it's the blessing of the lord it's not the blessing of the lord it is a spawning of satan it is born of satan and his lies and the untruths that he has bended embedded in the mind and in the hearts of men she does not say eve doesn't give adam the credit with the fatherhood of cain oh praise god but in genesis 4 25 she says god has appointed me another seed instead of a bell she calls cain another seed he's not like adam he's another seed oh my praise god study these things yourself which i cannot go into everything in depth here while we are now dealing with this oh praise god thank god set was appointed instead of a bell and she recognizes her son that came by adam but she does not now recognize cain for he came by the serpent and she says another seed instead of a bell praise god in other words she was saying cain is different from abel uh uh you see oh if it was from adam she would have said god has given me more seed but god hadn't given her any any seed like that so she said uh you know here's a another seed instead of a bell praise god hallelujah now we know that there is an inherent fear of snakes in the human race and we find out and we can uh read of this unconscious revulsion and fear that man has of snakes and it's natural for people to be fascinated by the glistening gleaming multicolored beauty of these uh beasts these creatures called snakes and we know that this is what causes birds people and so on to stand staring at snakes the hypnotic effect of snakes they also have a sexually unconscious uh aura that comes off from snakes sexual lure of snakes is also evident it's unconsciously evidence and snakes have always been attractive and that's why we know isaiah 53 there was nothing to be to uh was attractive a beauty to behold in him not whatsoever he was plain and simple but here we find a tall handsome attractive beast called the snake and so the snake has always stood for fertility evil sexuality and he stands also for both good and bad and has been a phallic symbol through all the ages now you know of all egyptian phallic uh turrets and and pillars and roman great phallic pillars that are there that's what they represent right under the noses of religion but then we find that of course in the garden the serpent is the personification of satan manifesting passionate evil upon the face of the earth and he's always associated with sex and often worshipped in conjunction with it now we find out the study of sexology of course i'm not telling you to go study anything like that i am hitting the surface just to bring the truth to you to you at this particular time hallelujah a lot of people don't read their bibles read your bible they don't know what the scriptures say we know the story of the flood is known throughout the world we know about the fall of man amen and consciously unconsciously in the heart of man they kind of know why sex is the primary sin upon the face of the earth and that eve did not eat an apple but she was an adulteress and committed a sexual act with the serpent that was not a snake but was looking like a man not going on his belly but walking around intelligent the bible says subtle and the scriptures tell us in the curse from today thou shalt grow upon thy belly see that's the way we see it that's the way it is in the word of god now you say well brother simon why didn't god warn eve about the danger of the serpent well god doesn't have to do that for god has already spoken his word god isn't ready stop you shall not touch thou shalt not eat he spoke the word clearly and eve believing the serpent added to the word of god and changed the word of the living god uh for instance the devil might have confused her and tell her well you know you can preserve the fruit you might not be able to keep it but you can preserve it or something uh of that way you see oh my and yet at the same time man she was trying to have her way and at the same time of god's way and it's the same with the so-called modern day christians they want to have their own way live their own way and still go to church sing and praise god and think that they are praising god in and pleasing him but you can't be a black white bird you can't be a drunk sober man you're either drunk or you're zoba that's the way it is you're either in truth or you're in error and he that is guilty in one point of the law has broken the entire word of god don't fool along with the word of god don't play with it don't add to it and don't take away from it but stay with the original word of god now what what did this tree of knowledge produce it produce death because cain killed his brother abel that wicked one my friends killed the righteous and that has set a pattern until this very day in which we live and that pattern will continue on until the restoration of all things spoken of by the prophets that tree of knowledge of good and evil brought death it also produced wisdom the serpent wisdom of satan coming on the face of the earth and producing men of renown clever men giants of knowledge giants in every possible way of scholarship looming over on the horizon as giants over the entire uh myriads of population and masses of men men of reputation and men have renowned but their ways are the ways of death their teachings and principles and philosophies are the ways of death god's people my friends are really a simple humble people called by god spiritually minded and they lean towards god they see god in his word they see him in his work they see him in nature they see god everywhere all praise god as they go about their business chilling the soil and praising god doing their work and praising god and giving him all the glory amen and these are a simple people they care for their care for god's truth rather than wealth satan's people love wealth rather than the truth they love their economy rather than loving humanity and they're caught in that trap and they elevate elevated to that place you see the seed of the serpent has always brought true commerce great commerce upon the face of the earth wonderful inventions but with those inventions along with the good of some of these inventions they bring along with them death their gun powder their atomic bombs killing war but it also kills in peace time their mechanical inventions whether it be guns whether it be tanks whatever even trucks cars whatever they they kill even more in peace time than those inventions do during wartime death and destruction are the fruits of eve's labors death and evil spawned by the serpent through her instrumentality and working through the modern day institution and so-called church bodies producing these uh bastard born to the word of the living god the real genuine born against sons of god changed by the word of god or revealed to them and brought into his kingdom to communicate with with him oh praise god hallelujah by the vine inspirations oh praise god amen yes sir these clever evil serpent seeds they're religious they're not out there anti-god they know there's a god for the devil believes and he trembles he knows there is a god so they are religious and they believe in god they are religious they are like their father the devil first i said they bring death secondly he sent down his serpent wisdom and now he works through the means of religion for he is religious and they are like their father the devil from the beginning their ancestor cain who was religious with an altar that could not please god for what is not of faith is of sin yes but kingdom never believe abel believe god they go to church cain and his generation goes to church they mingle along with the righteous just like the tears mingle with the wheat and in so doing they corrupt the righteous amongst them and produce a nickelodeon form of religion whereby they seek to dominate and dominar everywhere they go they spread their evil poison in every effort to destroy the seed of god even as cain killed a bell so does his seed to this very day there is no fear of god before their eyes oh my and god but i want to tell you god loses none of his own and i'm winding up on one of close now god does not and will not lose none of his own for he said i have them in the palm of my heart and there are none that can take them out from the palm of my hand and god will keep his beloved he's elected his chosen ones he'll keep them even in the time of death and he has promised that he will raise them up in the last days in the last day and because i live you shall live also thanks be to god may the lord help you to digest this meal that you have received may the word of god find its way into the center of your heart and your being as you listen to this go back watch it listen to it again take out your bible search these things whether they be true for they are true may god bless you everyone until we come again together around the word of god for another study in the church ages may the lord bless you and give you an overcoming life god bless you [Music] you
