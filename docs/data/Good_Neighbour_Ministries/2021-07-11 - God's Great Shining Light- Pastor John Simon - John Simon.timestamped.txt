[40:59] and trusting as the days go by
[41:02] that god will bless us and
[41:06] we'll be able to have a full house we
[41:09] give god the glory
[41:10] honor and praise welcome back into the
[41:13] house of the lord
[41:15] and the presence of the living god may
[41:18] the lord richly bless you in every
[41:20] possible way
[41:21] now last week some believers have had
[41:25] operations and prayer was made for them
[41:29] they came through safely
[41:31] and we thank the lord and give him
[41:33] praise for that
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:40] this week i am aware of other believers
[41:44] that
[41:44] also have to go for operations
[41:48] and so i ask you to pray for them
[41:51] that god will bring them through safely
[41:55] also by his marvelous grace
[41:58] brother coffee's mother has passed away
[42:02] and we want to remember him
[42:06] with god's spirit of love and comfort
[42:10] that the holy spirit will comfort him in
[42:13] this
[42:13] hour and in this time we thank the lord
[42:17] that god has made him a believer and a
[42:19] saint of god
[42:20] and trusting that he will be a blessing
[42:24] to the
[42:24] others uh when he does go over to his
[42:28] own place to take care of the burial
[42:34] that may not be this week or next week
[42:36] it may be in another month or something
[42:37] like that
[42:38] but we're trusting the lord but these
[42:41] are some of the things that
[42:42] have occurred and we give god
[42:46] grace that he has brought us through
[42:49] praise the lord
[42:51] may the lord richly bless you now you
[42:54] know
[42:54] sons of god children of god
[42:58] are led by the spirit of god
[43:01] in john chapter 3 jesus said
[43:05] but the spirit blew it where the wind
[43:07] blew it where it lifts
[43:08] wherever it wants right and no
[43:12] man knows where it goes amen
[43:15] what i'm saying is you know with the
[43:17] blowing of the wind or breeze
[43:19] it doesn't blow at full force all the
[43:22] time
[43:24] you don't have hurricane winds all the
[43:26] time
[43:27] and so it's the same with the preaching
[43:30] you
[43:30] you don't have the eagles flying up five
[43:34] ten miles in the upper atmosphere all
[43:37] the time
[43:39] but then god sometimes lifts you up
[43:42] praise the lord so we want to thank god
[43:46] for his marvelous and wonderful grace
[43:49] that we can uh give god the glory that
[43:52] there's a prophet
[43:54] as as a brother was giving god thanks
[43:56] for
[43:58] and that prophet was led by god to leave
[44:01] a store
[44:02] house and
[44:05] the storehouse is not a place
[44:09] it's not a country it's not any
[44:12] individual
[44:13] the storehouse is the message
[44:16] that he left behind everything is stored
[44:20] in there
[44:21] we just got to find it in the storehouse
[44:25] and the holy spirit will lead us and
[44:27] guide us and bring us to that place
[44:30] praise the lord god bless you sisters
[44:33] thank you very much
[44:34] praise the lord god bless every one of
[44:37] you for your contributions
[44:39] amen now um
[44:42] here we find we are going to

[44:54] and we are going to read from verse one
[44:57] to four
[44:59] i may not be able to complete
[45:02] this here today but we will follow
[45:06] the holy spirit and where he
[45:09] leads us we will follow
[45:13] and may he have the glory honor and
[45:15] praise
[45:16] genesis chapter 1 reading from verse
[45:20] 1 to 4 praise the lord

[45:48] and little by little the holy spirit is
[45:51] taking a grip
[45:52] amen so we give him all the praise the
[45:55] honor and the glory
[45:57] that while we are gathered here together

[46:12] spreading out
[46:13] to others who are starting to see the
[46:15] message this way
[46:17] and receiving a blessing from it praise
[46:20] god
[46:21] amen genesis 1
[46:24] 1 to 4.
[46:29] in the beginning god created the heaven
[46:33] and the earth and the earth
[46:37] was without form and void
[46:41] and darkness was upon the face of the
[46:44] deep
[46:45] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[46:50] face of the waters and
[46:53] god said let
[46:56] there be light and god
[46:59] saw the light that it
[47:03] was good and god divided
[47:07] the light from the darkness
[47:10] amen you can read verse 5 and
[47:14] god called the light day and the dark
[47:17] darkness he called night and the evening
[47:21] and the morning worthy first
[47:24] day amen god bless us
[47:28] together father we thank you for the
[47:30] reading of the word
[47:31] we ask the great holy spirit will come
[47:35] and quickness to the word that you may
[47:38] receive
[47:39] all praise and glory in jesus name amen
[47:42] praise the lord god bless you please be
[47:44] seated
[47:48] the holy spirit i believe god is trying
[47:51] to help us in every possible way
[47:54] to open our hearts and open our minds
[47:58] and our lives praise god amen
[48:02] now if you look you know genesis of
[48:04] course is the seed
[48:06] chapter of the bible genesis is the
[48:09] beginning
[48:10] it's the very first part of the word of
[48:13] god
[48:14] and here we see in this scripture
[48:18] god spirit moved on the face
[48:22] of the waters now at that time
[48:26] the earth was without form
[48:29] and void we use the term
[48:33] uh the chaotic earth because
[48:37] as brother branham mentioned dr pember
[48:40] others have mentioned before this time
[48:44] something chaotic took place on the face
[48:48] of the earth to make it
[48:50] without form and void and so
[48:54] god here now as we enter the story
[48:59] we are seeing uh are visualizing the
[49:03] holy spirit
[49:05] moving over the great
[49:08] voids and uh
[49:11] darkness that clothed the entire earth
[49:15] at that time
[49:18] now there was no light as yet
[49:21] there was no such a thing as light as
[49:23] yet
[49:24] it was just void and it was just
[49:27] darkness and nothing could be
[49:31] seen at that particular time
[49:34] except that we read in the word of god
[49:37] and god's spirit moved
[49:41] over the face of the waters
[49:45] now i want you to notice that the moving
[49:48] of the holy spirit like he would move in
[49:50] any meeting
[49:52] that didn't give light even though he
[49:56] moved the spirit was moving over the
[49:58] face of those
[49:59] of the darkness and the chaos that was
[50:03] there
[50:04] his moving over that did not bring light
[50:09] so you can have great conventions great
[50:11] meetings
[50:12] great movings of the holy spirit on the
[50:15] people and everything else
[50:17] that doesn't bring light
[50:20] that is just the moving of the holy
[50:23] spirit
[50:23] moving there amen you see because
[50:27] god had not begun his creation yet
[50:31] hey man first pull second pull
[50:35] third pull amen see god had not begun
[50:40] his creation yet even things were there
[50:43] there were things there there were
[50:44] supernatural things there
[50:46] there were the spirit was moving
[50:48] supernatural happenings were taking
[50:50] place
[50:51] but god's or creation had not yet begun
[50:56] and so here we are when we look at the
[51:00] bible
[51:01] what we can see clearly is the first
[51:05] thing that god created was
[51:09] light and god
[51:13] said let there
[51:17] be light amen
[51:20] and he said that light
[51:24] was good light is always good
[51:28] the devil doesn't like light but we
[51:31] love light because we are children of
[51:36] the light amen now if we will
[51:40] read further down in the word of god
[51:44] genesis chapter 14 acme chapter 1 verse
[51:49] 14
[51:50] and god said let there be
[51:54] lights in the firmament
[51:57] of the heaven to divide the day
[52:01] from the night and let them be
[52:04] for signs and for seasons
[52:07] and for days and years
[52:10] and let them be for lights
[52:14] in the formament of the heaven
[52:17] to give light upon the earth
[52:21] and it was so and god
[52:25] made two great lights the greater light
[52:28] to rule the day
[52:30] and the lesser light to rule the night
[52:34] and he made the stars also
[52:37] and god set them in the firmament of the
[52:40] heaven
[52:41] to give light upon the earth and to rule
[52:45] over the day and over the night
[52:47] and to divide the light from the
[52:50] darkness
[52:52] and god saw that it was
[52:55] good and the evening
[52:59] and the morning were the fourth
[53:02] day number of the bride first day light
[53:06] uh one and uh you know
[53:10] fourth day number of the brain
[53:14] so what we're looking at here
[53:20] chapter 1 verses 1 to 4
[53:25] we're reading that god created light
[53:30] but now when we come to
[53:33] verses 14 he's created
[53:36] light again so what is it there's two
[53:40] lights here created
[53:42] uh one is to shine
[53:45] on the earth he repeats it over and over
[53:49] these lights are to be in the firmament
[53:52] of the heavens
[53:53] he's not talking about supernatural
[53:55] heaven above he's talking about these
[53:57] former men these ones are to be here and
[54:00] to shine down
[54:02] upon the earth but there was another
[54:05] light
[54:06] that was first created that came
[54:10] from the word of god at that
[54:13] particular time hallelujah
[54:16] of course we know that lesser light
[54:19] was the sun and the moon that we still
[54:23] now enjoy
[54:24] that is why brother branham said you're
[54:26] not looking at a different moon or a
[54:28] different
[54:29] uh sun even though millennia
[54:32] has passed it's the same sun and the
[54:35] same wound
[54:36] that you're looking at amen the same
[54:39] stars
[54:40] you see the word of god doesn't change
[54:42] either it doesn't change doesn't matter
[54:44] how many people or many
[54:45] generations pass the word remains the
[54:48] same
[54:49] it does not change hallelujah amen
[54:53] so these lights are to shine on the
[54:57] earth
[54:58] but this other light the first one
[55:02] that god created
[55:05] that is the one that we
[55:08] are talking about here today and i'm
[55:11] saying to you that
[55:12] that first light was
[55:16] god creating s-o-n
[55:19] light you see god
[55:22] set forth his only begotten
[55:26] son amen
[55:29] and he was the very first light
[55:34] that came out from the very bosom
[55:38] of god at that particular time
[55:42] hallelujah now you know brother branham
[55:45] said listen
[55:46] the the son israeli the holy spirit
[55:50] that came out from the father it's just
[55:52] the form that he's going to be in either
[55:54] in flesh or he's going to be in spirit
[55:56] form
[55:57] but it's the son that came out
[56:00] from the father amen and jesus
[56:03] never called himself son of god he
[56:06] always referred to himself as
[56:08] son of man son of man
[56:12] so that's the way he is because we know
[56:15] that the uh the son of god or the
[56:19] holy spirit is really the spirit form
[56:23] of jesus christ the holy spirit is
[56:27] really the spirit form
[56:29] of jesus christ he was there physically
[56:31] he went back
[56:33] amen wherever he says he lay that body
[56:36] on the altar there in the presence
[56:39] of the throne and come back
[56:42] down in the form of the holy spirit
[56:46] so it's the same jesus christ
[56:49] in the spirit form
[56:52] as the holy spirit amen
[56:55] praise god and the holy spirit
[56:59] is the same pillar of fire that was
[57:02] back there in the old testament
[57:06] over the children of israel it's all
[57:09] jesus christ whether he was in pillar of
[57:12] fire whether he
[57:14] comes as the holy spirit whether he
[57:16] stands there
[57:17] in the form of a man it's the same jesus
[57:20] christ amen
[57:23] i'm speaking on the subject of god's
[57:26] great shining light
[57:29] amen hallelujah
[57:32] what did god force create them the
[57:36] pillar of fire
[57:38] amen god first creation
[57:41] created the pillar of fire
[57:44] hallelujah in other words if you want to
[57:47] put it this way
[57:48] god creating god god written a part of
[57:50] himself
[57:51] to represent him on the face of the
[57:54] earth
[57:55] the pair of fire being himself and when
[57:58] he spoke
[57:59] and he said let there be light
[58:02] a form of himself began to take place
[58:07] amen and that form of himself that began
[58:11] to take place
[58:12] we call the pillar of fire something we
[58:14] can
[58:15] see something our senses can contact
[58:19] or uh visualize and recognized well it's
[58:22] here
[58:23] because remember god is a spirit and you
[58:26] couldn't see
[58:26] him he inhabited all eternities
[58:31] amen he was everywhere and there's no
[58:34] one place you're going to look
[58:35] and search to find god because god
[58:38] inhabits all the realms all the
[58:42] dimensions
[58:43] all the universes all time all
[58:46] space everything it's it was all
[58:50] god making himself that way
[58:54] and so that word come from god
[58:58] and it started out praise god you you
[59:01] let go back read brother branham i don't
[59:03] have to go back to allah
[59:04] but he says one little light began to
[59:07] move around
[59:08] like that and before you know it
[59:12] the pure of fire began to take shape
[59:16] hallelujah amen and out of that
[59:20] pillar of fire comes the logos
[59:24] amen the logos amen
[59:27] that came out of there which was a
[59:30] great light amen that great light of god
[59:35] but not just a natural light to shine
[59:39] on the earth down here it was
[59:43] a spirit light or spiritual light
[59:46] amen praise the name of the living god
[59:50] hallelujah god spoke the word
[59:54] and said let there
[59:57] be hallelujah then what happened
[1:00:01] all the attributes
[1:00:04] of the word begin to
[1:00:08] take a form hallelujah
[1:00:12] it was all the attributes taking a form
[1:00:14] together
[1:00:16] to make up that purifier that logos
[1:00:19] later
[1:00:20] melchizedek later jesus christ but it
[1:00:23] was
[1:00:24] all the attributes for in
[1:00:27] him was the fullness of the godhead
[1:00:30] bodily
[1:00:32] oh that was god what went into christ
[1:00:35] hallelujah
[1:00:36] and all that is in christ what became
[1:00:39] the church
[1:00:40] lord of god that's why she is him
[1:00:44] revealed in this hour christ
[1:00:47] is the mystery of god himself
[1:00:51] being revealed amen
[1:00:54] praise the lord we realize
[1:00:58] that of course became
[1:01:02] melchizedek and you know
[1:01:05] the preaching on that how that
[1:01:08] melchizedek the word form of god
[1:01:12] began to end morphe and it in morphe or
[1:01:16] chains transformed it began to
[1:01:20] transform itself god coming down
[1:01:24] from his glory of a living story making
[1:01:27] a step
[1:01:28] down until melchizedek became
[1:01:31] jesus christ god stepping into a human
[1:01:35] form
[1:01:36] amen but that formation started from
[1:01:40] way back in the eternities
[1:01:44] and that formation came down through
[1:01:48] thousands of years until
[1:01:51] the present time that we are in
[1:01:55] so we give god the glory the honor
[1:01:59] and the praise hallelujah amen
[1:02:02] we thank god for the pillar of fire how
[1:02:04] many of you thank god for the pillar of
[1:02:06] fire
[1:02:07] how many of you thank god for the
[1:02:09] sunlight
[1:02:10] amen i thank god for the sunlight amen
[1:02:14] praise god verse 26 if you've
[1:02:17] got your bible
[1:02:22] and god said let
[1:02:25] us make man in our own
[1:02:28] image and after
[1:02:31] our likeness you see man was made in
[1:02:34] god's image
[1:02:36] man was made in god's lightness
[1:02:40] or he was made like god
[1:02:44] amen he was made like god
[1:02:48] and in the same image well
[1:02:51] how could that be in the human sense
[1:02:54] because god had no form yet
[1:02:58] god had no likeness
[1:03:02] we can look at us yet so
[1:03:05] what the scripture is telling you that
[1:03:08] because he
[1:03:10] was or is the eternal spirit
[1:03:13] and man was led in his image
[1:03:16] when he created man he force created a
[1:03:20] spirit man
[1:03:23] if he first created a spirit man
[1:03:27] that you could not see with your eyes
[1:03:30] but even though he was a spirit he was a
[1:03:32] man
[1:03:33] even though he was a spirit he
[1:03:36] was a person just like
[1:03:40] let's let's turn a minute here the devil
[1:03:43] you can't see him
[1:03:46] but yet he is a person
[1:03:49] amen only that he has no
[1:03:52] form he needs
[1:03:55] a body or something to get into
[1:03:59] before he can take a form other than
[1:04:02] that
[1:04:02] he's still in his spirit
[1:04:06] form praise god so god
[1:04:09] then created adam
[1:04:12] amen as a spirit man
[1:04:17] in his image and in
[1:04:20] his lateness and he gave him authority
[1:04:24] and dominion
[1:04:26] over all the cattle over
[1:04:29] all the animals the entire creation
[1:04:33] was under that man
[1:04:37] praise the lord and so we are taking god
[1:04:42] that god created adam
[1:04:46] who came in the image like any son would
[1:04:49] of his father praise god he came in the
[1:04:53] likeness
[1:04:54] and the image of his father praise god
[1:04:57] and what the bible is talking about here
[1:05:00] this was way before adam
[1:05:04] came into flesh that god
[1:05:08] had created him and that he
[1:05:12] was in that spirit form
[1:05:15] hallelujah amen uh amen
[1:05:19] genesis 2 uh i believe seven
[1:05:23] and the lord formed man
[1:05:26] amen sorry not two sevens
[1:05:30] yes praise the lord
[1:05:34] hallelujah and the lord
[1:05:38] formed man of the dust
[1:05:41] of the ground and breathed into his
[1:05:44] nostrils
[1:05:45] the breath of life and man
[1:05:49] became a living soul
[1:05:53] now i want you to see here first the
[1:05:56] bible tells us
[1:05:58] god created man in his own image
[1:06:02] but now it's telling us now is forming
[1:06:06] man
[1:06:07] from the dust of the earth you see he's
[1:06:10] now got to give that spirit man
[1:06:13] just like he gave the word he had to
[1:06:15] start working to
[1:06:16] make the world start to take a form that
[1:06:19] it can be seen
[1:06:20] amen even so god
[1:06:24] start to form a man
[1:06:28] hallelujah from the dust of the earth
[1:06:32] praise god something he already made
[1:06:34] because the man was already created
[1:06:37] but this here was something that he took
[1:06:40] from the ark that he already created
[1:06:42] and begin to form amen
[1:06:46] a body for that man to step into
[1:06:50] hallelujah and to be able to be seen
[1:06:54] and known and recognized
[1:06:57] hallelujah i think it's conduct order
[1:07:00] and doctrine
[1:07:01] um volume one you can
[1:07:04] find this in there brother branham's
[1:07:08] saying god created man
[1:07:12] male and female
[1:07:16] created them but
[1:07:19] in you see genesis 2. i'm i'm quoting
[1:07:23] brother branham it's kind of you know
[1:07:24] how we talk sometimes broken up
[1:07:27] it says he formed
[1:07:31] but before he formed remember
[1:07:34] he first created hallelujah
[1:07:38] so this thought is not my thoughts it's
[1:07:40] just now the thoughts that
[1:07:42] were already in the storehouse are
[1:07:44] coming
[1:07:46] right praise the lord amen but here
[1:07:50] god force created and
[1:07:53] then he formed adam i repeat was first
[1:07:57] created
[1:07:59] and then he formed man from the dusted
[1:08:02] earth
[1:08:04] you see a lot of people because they
[1:08:05] don't know this they think man was
[1:08:07] created just when god was taking up the
[1:08:09] dust
[1:08:09] that's when he created adam but no adam
[1:08:11] was already created
[1:08:13] and he was in spirit form he was a
[1:08:15] spirit man
[1:08:17] amen but being in this as a spirit man
[1:08:20] i i don't have time for that but um
[1:08:24] while he was in that spirit form he was
[1:08:25] already ruling over the animals
[1:08:28] over all the trees of everything you
[1:08:30] tell him where to move what to do and
[1:08:32] everything else
[1:08:33] but he didn't have a body so he could
[1:08:36] not till the soil he could not do
[1:08:40] anything
[1:08:42] right because he was still as a spirit
[1:08:45] man
[1:08:46] praise god hallelujah amen
[1:08:50] praise god hallelujah so then
[1:08:53] god of course formed him into a flesh
[1:08:57] man
[1:08:58] using the dust of the earth
[1:09:02] and the spirit man went into the flesh
[1:09:05] man
[1:09:06] am i making sense the spirit man
[1:09:09] went into the flesh man that was formed
[1:09:13] by god
[1:09:14] from the dust of the earth
[1:09:17] amen go back to the quote of brother
[1:09:20] branham
[1:09:21] so god created man
[1:09:24] in his own image the first time
[1:09:28] and then that's the second time now
[1:09:32] quoting brother branham then he formed
[1:09:35] man of the dust of the earth
[1:09:38] out of the dust and breathed
[1:09:42] in his nostrils amen
[1:09:46] what is the difference what is the
[1:09:49] connection
[1:09:49] there brother branham asking that amen
[1:09:53] praise the lord now you'll notice
[1:09:57] in genesis 1 26
[1:10:01] god said let us make man
[1:10:04] in our own image amen
[1:10:07] and if you'll notice in the creation
[1:10:10] the first thing that was created of
[1:10:12] course
[1:10:13] was light amen
[1:10:16] the first thing god created was light
[1:10:20] amen and what was the last thing god
[1:10:22] created
[1:10:24] man and jesus says what
[1:10:27] i am the first i am the last
[1:10:31] i am the alpha i am the omega
[1:10:35] i'm the beginning of creation and i'm
[1:10:38] the ending of all of it
[1:10:39] i i'm the one i'm all of it amen
[1:10:42] hallelujah
[1:10:44] first and the last amen alpha and omega
[1:10:47] same yesterday today and forever
[1:10:51] thanks be on a god hallelujah
[1:10:54] amen praise god say created
[1:10:57] man in his own likeness praise
[1:11:00] god hallelujah amen so
[1:11:03] thank god for that aren't you glad for
[1:11:06] that brother sister
[1:11:07] you you you see all this ties into your
[1:11:09] election
[1:11:11] because like i said before when that
[1:11:14] pillar of fire and the holy spirit
[1:11:17] logos came out you were
[1:11:20] part of the fullness of all them
[1:11:23] attributes together
[1:11:24] that was in god only that he gave its
[1:11:28] shape in the form of one man
[1:11:32] amen and in him was the fullness
[1:11:36] of the attributes the fullness of the
[1:11:38] godhead
[1:11:40] bodily now in a body on the face of the
[1:11:44] earth hallelujah
[1:11:46] amen and you were a part of him
[1:11:49] it's you're only now being made manifest
[1:11:53] you're now being made recognized for who
[1:11:56] you are
[1:11:58] you're recognizing yourself in the word

[1:13:41] very coat i started
[1:13:42] he says here he he he made him in his
[1:13:45] own image
[1:13:47] to lead the cattle lead the beasts of
[1:13:49] the field
[1:13:50] just like the holy spirit is
[1:13:53] here to lead us believers
[1:13:57] today becoming a body counted as
[1:14:01] animals they come to the ass and just
[1:14:04] like
[1:14:05] that adam in the natural is showing
[1:14:07] ahead of time
[1:14:09] what the holy spirit is going to come
[1:14:10] here and what he's going to do
[1:14:13] lead us who is in these bodies he's
[1:14:16] going to lead us
[1:14:17] by the holy spirit of the living god

[1:14:24] for this great holy spirit that leads us
[1:14:28] today amen praise god i'm happy today
[1:14:32] that the holy spirit leads us amen
[1:14:36] praise god he said because remember
[1:14:39] adam was not in the flesh form yet
[1:14:44] when he was commanding the trees
[1:14:47] and the animals and telling them what to
[1:14:50] do
[1:14:50] just like the holy spirit is here now
[1:14:53] and speaking to
[1:14:54] us and leading us but he's not in his
[1:14:57] body
[1:14:58] now amen but yet he's leading and
[1:15:01] guiding us enough authority
[1:15:03] over us praise god adam was not in his
[1:15:06] body yet he was control
[1:15:08] of the entire creation brother ben said
[1:15:12] that is a type
[1:15:13] of the holy spirit how he leads us today

[1:15:26] spirit man a man and yet a person
[1:15:31] amen hallelujah praise the lord god
[1:15:34] but remember adam was of
[1:15:38] the lore a lower creation

[1:15:44] place of one
[1:15:46] thing light and that was the highest
[1:15:50] form of god creation
[1:15:53] and then comes adam afterwards
[1:15:56] and animals and all that stuff a lower
[1:16:00] form
[1:16:01] of creation and praise god
[1:16:06] because we know of course the higher
[1:16:07] form is the
[1:16:09] pillar of fire amen and
[1:16:12] how that god used that to express
[1:16:16] himself amen praise the lord i'm so glad
[1:16:20] brother sister
[1:16:21] for god's great shining light
[1:16:24] that he sent on the face of the earth
[1:16:27] not to shine
[1:16:28] like the sun shining out there but a
[1:16:31] supernatural light to shine
[1:16:33] in here the supernatural light
[1:16:36] to shine in our hearts and to shine on
[1:16:39] the word
[1:16:40] and bring the word of god to life just
[1:16:43] like the sunlight
[1:16:44] brings seeds and brings things to life
[1:16:47] on the natural earth this light of god
[1:16:50] over the word of god
[1:16:52] is supposed to bring life hallelujah
[1:16:55] or supernatural life amen
[1:16:58] thanks be to god for his great shining
[1:17:02] light upon us to move upon the earth
[1:17:06] again and to bring light
[1:17:09] and life praise god amen
[1:17:12] you know that's the same light that's
[1:17:14] going to shine in the new jerusalem

[1:17:20] revelation it says there's going to be
[1:17:21] no sun
[1:17:22] and it'll be no moon is it because the
[1:17:26] lamb himself shall be the light thereof
[1:17:30] hey glory to god hallelujah
[1:17:33] thank you lord thank you lord he
[1:17:37] shall be the light for he is the light
[1:17:42] over and over again he tried to tell us
[1:17:44] this and even when i have read it for so
[1:17:46] many years
[1:17:47] and i understood to a certain degree
[1:17:50] it's white now for me to understand
[1:17:53] clearly when he said i
[1:17:55] am the light of the world
[1:17:58] he that fall with me shall not
[1:18:01] walk in darkness you're not talking
[1:18:03] about that dark out there
[1:18:05] he's talking about pillar of fire light
[1:18:07] up the world back then
[1:18:09] and if you follow that you'll never walk
[1:18:11] in spiritual darkness
[1:18:12] you'll never walk in the ignorance
[1:18:15] because you're led by god's great
[1:18:17] shining light
[1:18:20] hallelujah oh my do you
[1:18:23] oh i can't there's so many lights going
[1:18:26] off here
[1:18:27] can you imagine brother branham
[1:18:29] understanding
[1:18:31] that and when he sees that praying that
[1:18:34] three o'clock in the morning and he sees
[1:18:35] that
[1:18:36] little piece of light begin to whirl
[1:18:38] around
[1:18:39] coming down from in the roof and come
[1:18:42] down before him and then form
[1:18:45] amen in the form of a man
[1:18:48] oh my praise god hallelujah
[1:18:51] and begin to talk to him and often he
[1:18:55] would see
[1:18:56] that same light moving in the
[1:18:58] congregation
[1:18:59] moving over the people and doing things
[1:19:02] like that
[1:19:02] oh praise god forever listen there's
[1:19:06] a lot of obscure quotes if you you might
[1:19:08] not even notice
[1:19:09] where you say and i saw that elijah and
[1:19:12] the wind blew and his court move
[1:19:14] he was looking back and literally seeing
[1:19:17] the reality seeing elijah and when the
[1:19:20] wind blew it moved amen
[1:19:22] so just like moses was able to look
[1:19:26] back in creation and look back and tell
[1:19:29] you
[1:19:29] and the spirit of god moved here is a
[1:19:32] prophet in our generation

[1:20:09] throne

[1:20:15] halo above his head but
[1:20:17] other than that the whole place is full
[1:20:19] of light amen

[1:22:52] through someplace else to break into it
[1:22:54] before he gives it to you

[1:23:30] new jerusalem praise god
[1:23:34] hallelujah now go back to genesis again
[1:23:38] god himself was without form

[1:29:21] praise god amen yes sir
[1:29:24] oh my conduct order doctrine i think
[1:29:27] it's page 14
[1:29:28] says here oh he was in other words
[1:29:32] adam the first man
[1:29:36] in the lore creation
[1:29:39] of the creations of god
[1:29:43] but the first creation was
[1:29:46] god himself amen
[1:29:49] what come out of him was god himself
[1:29:52] that he allowed that to
[1:29:54] manifest that way see
[1:29:57] then out of that
[1:30:01] came the logos which
[1:30:04] is the son of god
[1:30:07] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:30:11] yes out of that came the logos
[1:30:15] or the revealed word
[1:30:18] that we have now praise god that comes
[1:30:22] out
[1:30:22] of god amen oh is not
[1:30:26] marvelous and wonderful it didn't yet
[1:30:28] even take form in the form of jesus
[1:30:30] christ
[1:30:31] but the logos was there and you can
[1:30:34] of course john 1 1 is obvious to
[1:30:37] everybody well i'm saying this
[1:30:38] in the beginning read that scripture
[1:30:41] again and think
[1:30:42] after what you heard here what's the
[1:30:44] word
[1:30:46] and the word was with god
[1:30:49] and the word was god
[1:30:53] and the word became flesh
[1:30:56] and dwelt among us the same
[1:31:00] god spoke and out of him he created
[1:31:04] something of himself
[1:31:06] and it start to and morphe god
[1:31:10] down from his glory
[1:31:13] ever living story
[1:31:17] my god and savior came
[1:31:21] and jesus was his name
[1:31:25] amen god and morphium
[1:31:28] himself coming down right through
[1:31:32] melchizedek angel of the covenant and so
[1:31:34] on
[1:31:35] right down to the very time look my mind
[1:31:38] was just going thinking
[1:31:39] oh my no wonder when abraham
[1:31:43] met him and he spoke to him at his tent
[1:31:45] door
[1:31:47] later on when he got down and in in
[1:31:50] sodom there to rescue lot
[1:31:52] and he met melchizedek the moment
[1:31:55] melchizedek spoke
[1:31:56] he recognized the voice because he met
[1:31:58] the person up on the mountain
[1:32:00] and the person spoke to him oh my and he
[1:32:03] recognized the voice immediately
[1:32:05] oh praise god forevermore jesus christ
[1:32:09] the same
[1:32:10] yesterday today and forever brother
[1:32:12] sister
[1:32:13] oh praise god hallelujah amen
[1:32:17] i'm so thankful to the living god the
[1:32:20] quickener of the word
[1:32:21] that he has made himself known to us
[1:32:25] by bringing us into a relationship
[1:32:28] with the logos not just the
[1:32:32] rima or the written part of the word
[1:32:36] but he was already the word before the
[1:32:39] word
[1:32:40] could be seen or known
[1:32:43] or man can give it form in writing
[1:32:47] right god give it form in a person they
[1:32:49] give it form
[1:32:50] in writing and it's good but
[1:32:54] the word we are talking about is not
[1:32:57] just
[1:32:57] this one that's written on the pages
[1:33:00] here where
[1:33:01] show me that in the bible show me in the
[1:33:04] quotes
[1:33:05] where is that over there where is this
[1:33:07] where is that no
[1:33:09] that sounds good it sounds logical
[1:33:13] somebody like that i'll answer them what
[1:33:15] they want to hear by saying
[1:33:17] yes brother you are right and he is
[1:33:19] right
[1:33:20] well leave it like that praise the lord
[1:33:22] but i don't know him just by knowing him
[1:33:26] here
[1:33:27] i know him by the shining light of gods
[1:33:32] hallelujah god's great shining sunlight
[1:33:35] of the revelation coming forth from the
[1:33:37] word of god
[1:33:39] and that's not a dead thing that's not
[1:33:40] something i got to go study for that's
[1:33:42] not something i've got to spend hours
[1:33:44] and
[1:33:44] years and something like that for it
[1:33:46] just it flashes like that on you
[1:33:49] it breaks on you like that and then
[1:33:52] you're going to say well how am i going
[1:33:53] to say this
[1:33:54] how am i going to say that i'm going to
[1:33:57] say it
[1:33:58] but just bang it's right there you
[1:34:00] didn't make it
[1:34:01] you're going to go i study hard boy and
[1:34:03] they're like
[1:34:04] no no no no no no nothing like that it's
[1:34:07] almost like you're not doing nothing
[1:34:08] you're just
[1:34:09] walking around like anybody else and
[1:34:12] you're just going around and i was like
[1:34:13] bang out of nowhere
[1:34:15] first of all you don't want something
[1:34:16] that you make up
[1:34:19] because that might be good for people
[1:34:21] layers
[1:34:22] that might be good for their body their
[1:34:25] emotions their mind
[1:34:27] the parts of you it will appeal to but
[1:34:30] that's not what the holy spirit is after
[1:34:32] god wants your heart god wants your
[1:34:36] heart
[1:34:36] so the real pull is always towards
[1:34:39] the heart of the believer praise
[1:34:43] be to god hallelujah i'm watching the
[1:34:45] time i'm going to start to
[1:34:47] wind this up now because we'll pick it
[1:34:49] up

[1:34:52] praise the name of the lord
[1:34:53] hallelujah glory to god of course you
[1:34:56] know jesus said
[1:34:57] he is the light of the world amen
[1:35:01] i'm so glad that that's a light that's
[1:35:04] not even like the sunlight because the
[1:35:07] sun we got can only shine on half the
[1:35:09] world
[1:35:10] at a time is that right but he said no
[1:35:13] i am the light of the world
[1:35:16] hallelujah he lights up the whole world
[1:35:19] praise
[1:35:20] god doesn't matter which language what
[1:35:22] culture
[1:35:23] which country what color what nation
[1:35:26] doesn't care where you are when this
[1:35:28] change into your heart

[1:35:37] oh praise
[1:35:38] god you may express it in chinese and
[1:35:40] you speak japanese
[1:35:42] you must speak africa and the next one
[1:35:43] speaks some other language
[1:35:45] but it's the same word of god making
[1:35:48] yourself known in this hour
[1:35:50] glory to god no wonder he said you
[1:35:53] paul said what are you greeks and jews
[1:35:57] and and and this and that he says we are
