[0:10] started reading it was Psalm 51 verse
[0:15] 10 and it's from the Amplified Bible it
[0:21] says create in me a clean
[0:25] heart oh God and renew a right
[0:32] persevering
[0:33] steadfast Spirit within me that gripped
[0:37] me right away I thought
[0:40] wow it meant something had to change
[0:42] with
[0:43] me and I was so happy that I read it
[0:48] very first thing in the morning set the
[0:51] rest of the day

[0:57] us then where are we
[1:03] so it's his
[1:05] grace can you put that up if it wasn't
[1:08] for the grace of

[15:36] tonight God bless you Saints thank
[15:39] you
[15:40] [Music]
[15:42] amen
[15:49] hallelujah we want to continue tonight
[15:53] on the series of the power of tradition
[15:56] we want to talk about um
[15:59] as we said we went in through
[16:02] the the traditions of the Elders of the
[16:06] Pharisees and Sadducees and in the days
[16:08] of Jesus how they didn't recognize the
[16:11] revealed word for their
[16:13] day we took it down through the Dark
[16:15] Ages the nicadan spirit through the
[16:18] Catholic church we seen that
[16:21] Wesley uh Luther Wesley and Pentecost
[16:24] still carried a lot of traditions over
[16:28] amen like we know Luther he smoked the
[16:30] pipe he hated the Jews right but Faith
[16:33] was revealed to him that just shall live
[16:36] by faith so we can see that the
[16:38] Traditions were being carried over and
[16:42] we understand that in um in the last day
[16:46] we have the message and the message is
[16:48] two
[16:49] parts coming out and going in and we
[16:52] realized that brother Brandon was the
[16:55] seventh Church age messenger amen so he
[16:59] was preaching to the Pentecostals and a
[17:03] lot of his message was Pentecostal until
[17:05] it became a new book Hallelujah until
[17:09] the mighty angel came down we know the
[17:11] seals were
[17:13] breaking but then they were opened
[17:17] Hallelujah so we want to we want to just
[17:21] recap those things and we realize
[17:24] that which age that we are living in
[17:27] we're living in a different age
[17:29] today hallelujah it's very important to
[17:32] recognize the age and the time that
[17:34] we're living in this is the bride age
[17:38] hallelujah amen glory to
[17:42] God which the Holy Ghost can do only the
[17:46] Holy Ghost can do in this age that no
[17:48] man can
[17:50] do and bring you into that
[17:53] Capstone we understand that there are a
[17:55] lot of people in this message that are
[17:58] preaching Pentecost
[17:59] costal and a glorified Pentecostal
[18:02] message with the
[18:04] quotes but the Bride of Jesus Christ and
[18:07] that's what we want to focus now onto
[18:10] the Bride of Jesus
[18:12] Christ can only feed on him the mighty
[18:16] Angel she can't feed on men
[18:19] anymore like they did down Through the
[18:21] Ages but they only can feed on the
[18:24] Living Word of God hallelujah amen and
[18:27] that's where we overcome
[18:29] that's where we get perfect Faith that's
[18:31] where we get rapture in faith and that's
[18:33] where we get ready to leave this place
[18:36] amen hallelujah amen just a little
[18:40] overview here just to bring back you
[18:43] know it's a little time in between when
[18:44] I preach so we're going to go to um my
[18:47] title tonight is the bride will have the
[18:50] quickening power in the calf
[18:54] Stone she will have this quickening
[18:57] power that is promised to her that is
[19:00] prophesied to her in this day and age
[19:03] Hallelujah she's going to have it
[19:05] hallelujah amen let's go to acts
[19:09] 10:38 amen I just don't know which
[19:12] direction this is going to go in tonight
[19:14] but let us take it because we know we
[19:16] understand we want to talk about the
[19:18] quickening power we want to talk about I
[19:21] got a couple more messages along this
[19:23] line we want to talk about the Mysteries
[19:25] and we want to talk about the Thunders
[19:27] Hallelujah we we know like the church
[19:29] ages they all blend together so it's not
[19:32] separate separate separate they all
[19:34] blend together but they all they also
[19:37] are a different work of the Holy Spirit
[19:39] each and every one of them amen acts
[19:43] 10:38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
[19:48] with the Holy Ghost and with
[19:51] power so the Holy Ghost and with power
[19:55] we understand that when the spirit of
[19:58] truth comes it'll guide us and lead us
[20:00] into all truth the evidence of the Holy
[20:02] Ghost is when the spirit of Truth the
[20:04] spirit of Revelation
[20:06] comes so with the Holy Ghost and with
[20:09] power who went about doing good and
[20:13] healing all that were possessed of the
[20:15] devil for God was with him and we Are
[20:19] Witnesses of these things which he did
[20:23] both in the land of the Jews and in
[20:25] Jerusalem whom they slew
[20:29] and hung on a tree him God raised the
[20:32] third day and showed him openly not to
[20:36] all the people but unto Witnesses chosen
[20:41] before God hallelujah I believe we are
[20:44] witnesses chosen before God in this hour
[20:49] to see the things that we have seen we
[20:52] didn't see a prophet's Ministry and a
[20:55] prophet's life amen just to be
[20:59] glorified in a church amen but that was
[21:03] showing to us that we can understand and
[21:07] recognize what God will do in the future
[21:11] works of the church in the body of Jesus
[21:13] Christ
[21:15] amen chosen before God even to us who
[21:20] did eat and drink with him after he had
[21:22] Rose from the death and he commanded us
[21:25] to preach unto the people and to testify
[21:30] that he is which was ordained of God to
[21:33] be the judge of the quick and the dead
[21:38] let us turn to Luke
[21:42] 24:49
[21:45] Hallelujah glory to God Luke

[22:11] without the power of God we can't do it
[22:14] without the quickening power of God the

[22:23] us without it John 1613

[25:15] of God especially from the word of God
[25:17] that's ordained for this day and this

[25:23] because there's a promise given to her
[25:25] in these last days and she must fulfill
[25:28] F that promise that has been given to
[25:30] her because it's been prophesied by a
[25:33] prophet about her to fulfill certain

[26:31] God sends a prophet all these Mysteries
[26:34] shall be fulfilled amen and you can know
[26:37] all the Mysteries all you want but
[26:40] there's something greater than knowing

[37:31] Brown is speaking in all things
[37:33] here
[37:35] 1962 second Timothy 3 the Holy Spirit
[37:39] warns us that in the last days that the
[37:41] church would get away from the sincerity
[37:45] and the faith now he's not talking about
[37:48] the
[37:49] denominations he's talking about the
[37:51] church and the church is the message of
[37:54] the hour he said in this last day
[37:58] they will get away from that I'm not
[38:00] talking about the bride
[38:03] Hallelujah there's two different classes
[38:05] of people here the church we know that
[38:09] in every Church there's three types of
[38:11] Believers the make believer the
[38:13] unbeliever and the real believer amen
[38:16] you classify by Revelation who you are
[38:20] and what you see in your own life I
[38:22] can't do that amen
[38:26] hallelujah amen
[38:29] they'll have a form of godliness but
[38:32] they'll deny the power the quickening
[38:36] power that went with the right thing yes
[38:41] sir God hates a powerless religion
[38:44] experience and any religion today that
[38:47] hasn't got Christ in it is
[38:50] powerless Amen in 2 Timothy 3 1-4 he
[38:55] gives Timothy a long list
[38:58] of sinful behaviors and attitudes that
[39:00] are contrary to the word of God he tells
[39:03] Timothy to avoid these these states of
[39:06] these Christians this is Paul talking in
[39:09] the Bible to avoid certain Christians
[39:13] that are walking this way they have a
[39:16] form of godliness but who act like as
[39:19] unbelievers and they deny the power of
[39:22] godliness they deny the power that has
[39:25] been given in this hour to change us
[39:30] amen oh
[39:33] my listen brother Ram says God's word is
[39:36] God's word you can't compromise with it
[39:40] you can't change it you can't alter it
[39:43] it is God's
[39:44] word oh but the craftiness of man they
[39:49] take God's word and now they're taking
[39:51] the quotes amen and they're they're kind
[39:54] of polishing it this way and that way
[39:58] and what is it going to produce if it's
[40:00] not God's real word of God being spoken
[40:03] it's not going to produce the Bride of
[40:05] Jesus Christ brother Brandon warned in
[40:07] the spirit he says I'm afraid that
[40:10] ministers are not leading people to
[40:12] Christ they're leading them to a
[40:15] church but we got to lead people to
[40:18] Christ the life of God Amen the
[40:22] overcoming power Hallelujah rebuking sin

[40:36] Lord David said if there be any evil any
[40:40] sin in me Lord take it out expose it
[40:44] bring it to the
[40:45] surface he says I don't want to go on
[40:47] that day
[40:49] Hallelujah I want to get it right here I
[40:52] want to get everything right here and
[40:55] the devil is so cunning moving in many
[40:58] different ways in this hour in this day
[41:00] and age to try to cover that sin to try
[41:03] to cover that unbelief that
[41:06] life but God is trying to unfold it
[41:09] God's trying to speak and expose it
[41:12] because there's got to become a bride
[41:15] hallelujah
[41:18] amen
[41:20] amen listen here then we'll move on
[41:24] those who have a form of godliness and
[41:27] those who make an outward display of
[41:30] religion they present themselves as
[41:33] Godly but it is all for a
[41:36] show wow all for a
[41:41] show there is no power behind their
[41:44] religion as evidence in the fact that
[41:47] their lives are
[41:51] unchanged oh my
[41:53] God can you imagine that this word of
[41:58] God that we have in this hour the
[42:02] anointing on the fivefold ministry the
[42:05] preaching of the
[42:07] word and their lives are
[42:11] unchanged I can't imagine it because all
[42:14] I can see in my life yes I got
[42:17] mistakes I fall down but I get back up
[42:21] because I cry out to the Lord hallelujah
[42:24] when I'm in pain I cry out to the Lord
[42:26] and He hears My Cry he speaks to me lip
[42:30] to ear Hallelujah he comes in ways to
[42:34] meet with me and show me things to come
[42:37] he comes in ways to speak with me so I I
[42:40] am not perfect in this flesh but inside
[42:44] in my heart I'm perfect like my father
[42:47] is perfect because I want what he wants
[42:50] what he has spoken about me I want to
[42:53] walk this walk I want to talk this talk
[42:56] I want to see Christ manifested in my
[42:58] flesh I want to see him overcome how can
[43:02] I overcome by him who is already
[43:05] overcome Hallelujah I need more of the
[43:08] spirit of God hallelujah yes the Holy
[43:11] Ghost has come to my life and give me
[43:13] the new birth but I need to constantly
[43:16] be filled with the Holy Spirit in my
[43:19] life the challenges are getting more and
[43:22] more as we
[43:24] go cuz this flesh is trying to hold you
[43:26] down down Hallelujah the devil's trying
[43:30] to hold you down he doesn't want you to
[43:32] go
[43:33] higher he'll make a treaty with you
[43:36] he'll make you feel comfortable oh most
[43:39] people are most comfortable in this
[43:41] message I believe God sent a prophet I
[43:44] believe the quotes I listen to tapes

[44:07] obedience to the word of
[44:10] God

[44:15] here the power of God should accompany
[44:20] the form of godliness is shown through
[44:23] the Holy Spirit and the results in a
[44:25] transformation of Our Lives lives the
[44:27] Holy Spirit indwells Believers 1
[44:30] Corinthians 6:19 enables him to Bear
[44:33] certain fruits of the spirit like

[44:41] goodness faithfulness gentleness and
[44:44] self-control Galatians
[44:47] 5:22 we know that all that lies within
[44:50] the seat of God hallelujah that's why it
[44:54] says work out your own salvation

[45:00] you thinking about my life hallelujah
[45:04] it's none of your business about my life

[45:37] power to heal the sick and to raise the
[45:40] dead and cast out Devils just a few days
[45:43] before that they had the power but here
[45:47] we go now but they didn't have the faith
[45:50] to use that

[46:13] seen his power move and operate
[46:16] Hallelujah but you haven't got the faith

[46:25] move it
[46:27] Hallelujah we need him to come all we
[46:30] can do is be sincere all we can do is
[46:34] give our lives to him continue
[46:36] surrendering Our Lives to him amen
[46:39] calling upon him this is lamp triming

[47:27] the powder the powder got the power but
[47:31] it's got to have the fire to light it

[48:31] hallelujah smeared in church age here
[48:35] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[48:37] reign with him you have to suffer to
[48:40] Reign the reason for this is character
[48:44] simply never is made without suffering
[48:47] character is a victory not a gift and a
[48:50] man without character cannot Reign
[48:52] because power apart from character is
[48:56] satanic
[48:57] but the power of God Amen with character
[49:01] is fit the rule and that's what's
[49:04] happening in this hour God is building
[49:07] character through our suffering Amen in

[49:37] atmosphere that we've been taught by the
[49:39] prophet not only by his life but by his
[49:43] words Joshua was telling the people to
[49:47] consecrate and that word is like in this
[49:51] hour in the day and age that we live in
[49:54] there's so many excuses
[49:57] in all of our
[49:58] Lives to kill that
[50:00] word
[50:03] consecrate Hallelujah but Joshua's
[50:06] telling the children of Israel if you
[50:08] want to see the glory of the Lord you're
[50:10] going to go see the glory of the Lord
[50:12] you're going to go see the pillar of
[50:13] fire you got to consecrate yourself you
[50:16] got to wash be clean it that doesn't
[50:19] change my brothers and sisters

[50:25] says for tomorrow the Lord will do
[50:28] amazing things amongst you as he has
[50:31] promised to do in his
[50:32] word he's saying tomorrow but the Lord
[50:36] has given us a prophecy for this day and

[51:19] drifting away they start moving away
[51:23] where's the promise of his coming
[51:25] where's the promise of the rapture
[51:27] but this is the hour where the Bride of
[51:29] Jesus Christ recognizes that God is
[51:32] working in her life and also God is
[51:35] about to do great things and still ready
[51:39] to move in her life and fulfill more of

[54:30] desires of those things out of your

[54:43] spirit here we have a quickening power

[55:23] life he takes away the power
[55:29] from a child of
[55:31] God now listen brother BR is speaking
[55:33] here in the revelation of Jesus Christ
[55:36] now remember
[55:37] this Christ in the true church is a
[55:41] continuation of the book of
[55:45] Acts amen remember the vision when
[55:48] brother BR was caught up to heaven and
[55:51] the angel was standing right there we're
[55:53] not we're not just talking man's
[55:55] opinions here when the angel was
[55:57] standing right
[55:59] there and he said' will Paul be
[56:01] judged he saides Paul and his people
[56:04] will be judged for what he preached and
[56:05] brother Bram said I preach what Paul
[56:08] preached
[56:11] Hallelujah so brother bradam looked back
[56:14] to the early
[56:15] church the book of Acts and how they
[56:18] manifested in the spirit I believe if we
[56:21] get off of our high and mighty quotes
[56:25] and all these stuff the message and we
[56:27] go back to the the book of Acts and we
[56:29] see how the original Church operated how
[56:32] they functioned how they move how they
[56:34] lived their lives how they gathered
[56:36] themselves together how they prayed in
[56:38] the Holy Ghost how healing and power and
[56:41] miracles and life-changing situations
[56:44] were there amongst them it'll be a whole
[56:46] different story here instead of hiding
[56:48] behind quotes hiding behind you're in a
[56:50] message Church where's the power of God
[56:53] in our lives where is the quickening
[56:55] spirit that is promised to us we hear
[56:58] testimonies amen hallelujah I know it's
[57:02] not all about
[57:03] healing amen but that just shows when
[57:06] the power of God is confirming through
[57:09] signs and wonders there's a life inside
[57:11] there there's a life quickening that
[57:15] individual that's moving through them
[57:19] hallelujah amen let me tell you one
[57:21] thing there's a lot different when the
[57:23] Bride of Jesus Christ in this hour is
[57:25] moving moving and operating and laying
[57:28] hands upon the sick and they're
[57:29] recovering and healing then what's out
[57:31] there those Benny hings and all that
[57:33] stuff there's a totally different
[57:36] atmosphere totally different
[57:40] presence and that when not takes place
[57:43] because it doesn't only heal the body
[57:45] you see the power that's with inside the
[57:47] Bride of Jesus Christ because it is
[57:49] Jesus Christ doesn't only heal the body
[57:52] but it heals the soul it delivers the
[57:54] soul it delivers the spirit the mind it
[57:56] delivers everything from head to toe the
[58:00] power of God moves through the
[58:02] individual in this last days
