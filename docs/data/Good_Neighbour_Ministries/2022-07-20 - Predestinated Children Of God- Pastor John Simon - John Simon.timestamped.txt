[22:02] shall bruise
[22:03] his heel praise the lord god bless you
[22:07] please be seated
[22:12] well
[22:13] our last wednesday
[22:15] uh we ended the talk by
[22:19] speaking of the seeds that were in the
[22:22] pharaohs tomb
[22:23] from since the time of joseph
[22:26] they were in that tomb
[22:29] and all they were actually waiting on
[22:33] was the right kind of water
[22:37] the right kind of moisture to be able to
[22:40] strike that seed
[22:43] that it could come alive
[22:46] likewise multitudes who are elected or
[22:49] predestinated by god
[22:52] they
[22:53] might have been in all kinds of churches
[22:55] even groups in the message they've been
[22:57] in all kinds of societies and different
[23:00] things
[23:01] and always there's a longing there's a
[23:04] reaching inside there's a
[23:06] something missing there
[23:09] until
[23:10] the holy spirit takes the word of god
[23:14] and applies the word
[23:17] and it
[23:18] wakes up the seed that was buried in
[23:22] them
[23:23] by the great planter the great sore who
[23:27] told his own story when he said a man
[23:30] went forth to seoul
[23:32] and he sold seeds you know the story
[23:35] even god was speaking of himself
[23:38] so that you might catch it and
[23:40] understand what is happening so seeds of
[23:43] life better known we may use the word
[23:46] genes we may use attributes
[23:51] in him were all these things praise god
[23:55] and so
[23:56] he took those seeds and those seeds were
[24:00] in his elected
[24:02] children
[24:04] but as you know we have seven church
[24:06] ages
[24:08] and so many
[24:10] uh are elected to each age so many are
[24:13] in every age not a standard amount we
[24:16] don't know the amounts we don't know
[24:18] but god knows who they are
[24:21] but in every age he has children
[24:25] with the life of god in him
[24:28] because that was part of his plan
[24:31] to be able to push back against satan's
[24:35] uh
[24:36] satan's
[24:37] what should i say running ahead of god
[24:40] and preempting his plan his purpose that
[24:44] he wanted to carry out
[24:46] and so
[24:48] water came on those seeds
[24:51] and those seeds came to life
[24:54] it doesn't matter how long those seeds
[24:57] were sitting there
[25:00] they may look dead
[25:02] they may even go into a traditional
[25:04] church and act dead they know nothing
[25:07] else
[25:08] the seed of god lays there waiting on
[25:12] what the water of the holy spirit
[25:16] to come and wake up that seed
[25:19] the deep calls to the deep
[25:22] and the deep will respond praise god
[25:25] hallelujah amen at the same time let me
[25:29] make this point
[25:31] the word of god
[25:33] led through the ages centuries
[25:37] and they did everything they could to to
[25:42] say that god is dead the world is dead
[25:45] that's just literature it's poetry it's
[25:48] beautiful history and everything else
[25:51] but he sent a prophet to water the word
[25:55] for this age to prove to them that the
[25:58] lord is alive and that jesus christ is
[26:01] the same yesterday today and forever
[26:06] hallelujah praise god he says you know
[26:10] the water comes because
[26:13] the a real
[26:15] predestinated seed of god
[26:18] is an absorbent
[26:20] for the holy spirit amen in other words
[26:24] like a sponge
[26:26] oh my to take in the holy ghost praise
[26:30] the name of the lord hallelujah think
[26:33] about it because when the holy spirit
[26:37] comes
[26:39] unto that or into that germ of life
[26:42] that's laying there
[26:44] it produces another seed
[26:48] just exactly
[26:50] like another son of god is born
[26:54] you see
[26:55] they don't know it but it's an amateur
[26:58] god
[27:00] that
[27:00] person is a son of god
[27:03] a daughter of god an immature god why
[27:07] the spirit of god woke up the seed
[27:11] and the seed is what
[27:13] part of the word
[27:15] and the word was with god
[27:17] and the word was god and the word become
[27:20] you or me the word become flesh why
[27:24] because the wa it still remains the word
[27:28] after
[27:29] it remains a wheat seed after 3 000
[27:32] years and when they water it it comes
[27:36] out with a wheat seed
[27:38] and it is the prophet is trying to say
[27:40] here in the same way never mind you were
[27:43] unconscious you didn't know you had no
[27:46] idea whatsoever that seed just laying
[27:48] there waiting waiting waiting waiting
[27:52] amen until the holy spirit comes and
[27:56] wakes it up as he says in the church
[27:58] book if the seed be planted then the
[28:02] water will raise it up again
[28:05] amen praise god hallelujah so in the
[28:08] same way you as an individual elected
[28:11] seed were waiting laying there until the
[28:14] spirit comes
[28:15] in the same way the entire word of god
[28:20] that they tried to say is dead and
[28:22] everything else and that times of change
[28:26] we're living in a modern day and you're
[28:28] still saying women shouldn't dress this
[28:30] way and they shouldn't dress that way
[28:32] and and christians should be this way
[28:34] and baptism is this way and that way
[28:37] we're in a modern age and times have
[28:40] changed
[28:41] but they didn't realize the seed never
[28:44] changed even the natural one from joseph
[28:47] time never changed
[28:49] it remains the same seed let the water
[28:52] strike it it will act like the original
[28:54] seed
[28:56] and the same way when the holy spirit
[28:59] comes on the true believer it will cause
[29:02] the seed life in them to act like the
[29:05] original seed
[29:07] hallelujah the son of man
[29:10] the seed of god jesus christ
[29:14] these seed we are
[29:16] acid
[29:18] part of the word signified by the
[29:20] purifier breaking up on their pentecost
[29:23] we are part of the word that's why the
[29:25] scripture says in him
[29:28] was the fullness
[29:30] of the godhead bodily amen we were all
[29:35] in him
[29:36] praise god hallelujah i thank god for
[29:39] that listen he says don't you know
[29:43] oh my
[29:44] i am branham
[29:47] because i was born of ella
[29:50] and charles branham
[29:52] and that makes me a branham praise god
[29:56] hallelujah he is saying charles and ella
[29:58] branham produced him and automatically
[30:01] he's a branham
[30:04] he doesn't have to do anything to prove
[30:06] he's a brother
[30:08] he doesn't have to go to work to be a
[30:10] brand now
[30:11] he doesn't have to go and
[30:13] attend bible school to know he's a
[30:15] brother
[30:16] he doesn't have to go to any
[30:19] converts class for six weeks before you
[30:22] get baptized to know that he is abraham
[30:26] no sir the moment he was born from that
[30:29] mother and father he was abraham amen
[30:34] praise the name of the lord and i'm so
[30:36] happy about that that when the holy
[30:39] spirit reigns down on the seed life that
[30:42] is in us
[30:44] we
[30:45] recognize
[30:46] because that's what real salvation is is
[30:50] your eyes open and you recognize who you
[30:54] are
[30:56] where you come from who your father is
[30:59] amen and your journey of life
[31:02] and where you are going praise the lord
[31:05] hallelujah amen glory to god amen let me
[31:10] tell you if you plant a son of man seed
[31:14] what else can it produce but sons and
[31:17] daughters of men
[31:19] sons and daughters of god it can't
[31:21] produce because every seed has to bring
[31:24] forth after its kind
[31:26] hallelujah and he planted themselves in
[31:28] the ground and even tell you beforehand
[31:31] that i'm going down to the one seed goes
[31:34] down on the ground but when it comes up
[31:35] it's coming up multiplied it's coming up
[31:38] there producing a crop amen oh my and
[31:43] that
[31:43] the son of man produces and has produced
[31:48] sons of man hallelujah and collectively
[31:52] when you put all of them together they
[31:55] are the son of man for this
[31:58] day back then it was jesus
[32:02] was the son of man for that day
[32:05] hallelujah the head of the body or the
[32:08] husband to the bride
[32:10] but now here comes the bride amen
[32:13] anointed with the same holy spirit
[32:16] praise god and she becomes the what the
[32:19] manifestation of the son of man
[32:23] him
[32:24] operating and manifesting through her
[32:27] praise the name of the living god amen
[32:31] lord of god amen
[32:33] listen
[32:34] when the holy ghost rain falls on the
[32:38] elected seed of god he says
[32:42] what does it produce you see when that
[32:47] seed the spirit of
[32:49] god's spirit waters that seed of god
[32:53] then which is the word of god that it
[32:56] can't produce nothing else but god
[33:00] is that right
[33:01] hallelujah
[33:02] and you see
[33:04] from that time
[33:06] it's not the individual no more
[33:10] it's god hallelujah
[33:13] doesn't mean that all of a sudden we we
[33:15] lose our minds we don't know who we are
[33:18] where we come from and and god's spirit
[33:20] take us over brother brown said god's
[33:22] spirit doesn't work like that person
[33:24] know exactly what they're doing make
[33:26] their own choices
[33:27] and everything else satan is the one
[33:29] that plays on the people's mind get them
[33:31] insane then he can use them even more
[33:34] but god doesn't work like that you see
[33:37] he moves in his children see see because
[33:40] now it's god individual in the
[33:44] individual
[33:45] because what you are dead
[33:48] you are really not yourself anymore
[33:51] you because you by fact reckon yourself

[34:11] woman

[34:15] friends your family around you you're
[34:17] not going to see not no physical change
[34:20] it's the same one
[34:22] right
[34:23] but the man inside like paul said he's
[34:26] changing daily
[34:28] amen he's changing daily
[34:31] while he says while this outside man
[34:33] they're looking at is wasting away and
[34:36] and getting old and it's dying he says
[34:39] the inner man is alive and living come
[34:43] why is walking towards eternal life
[34:46] praise god hallelujah
[34:48] that's where he's headed he's walking
[34:50] towards eternal life praise god
[34:54] hallelujah see it isn't you anymore
[34:59] it isn't the
[35:00] man that woman
[35:03] it's god now in them
[35:06] it's the seed germ
[35:09] like the beginning spoken word
[35:13] god's word
[35:15] now made manifest in
[35:18] men
[35:20] is that what's happening now you see how
[35:22] simple and humble god does these things
[35:25] the brother branham said the greatest
[35:28] things are happening right in front of
[35:30] the people
[35:31] and they can't see it because they're
[35:33] not allowed to see it they're not
[35:35] allowed to see it just like israel was
[35:37] blinded they they can't see it but it's
[35:40] right in front of them praise god
[35:43] hallelujah
[35:44] oh my praise god i tell you friends it's
[35:49] the word of god that watered by the holy
[35:52] spirit
[35:53] it will produce the same thing it was
[35:56] amen can't produce anything else i'm
[35:58] talking about
[36:00] predestinated children of god
[36:04] predestinated children of god hallelujah
[36:08] now
[36:10] god
[36:12] spoke to eve from the very beginning and
[36:15] told her to multiply and replenish the
[36:19] earth
[36:20] satan heard that
[36:22] when he heard that he jumped ahead to
[36:26] copy what god was doing and to corrupt
[36:30] god's plan
[36:31] so eve under the spirit of uh seduction
[36:35] deception
[36:37] and
[36:38] uh lies
[36:41] you know she multiplied
[36:44] but she multiplied
[36:46] in for the mortal realm flesh realm is
[36:49] where she did the multiplication
[36:53] god had in his mind his multiplication
[36:56] would have been through the spoken word
[37:00] amen but she did the
[37:03] the devil i should say uh diverted and
[37:07] perverted it
[37:08] uh
[37:09] in other words to imprison
[37:12] or to capture all them seeds and trap
[37:14] them into flesh and then they will find
[37:17] no way out of it because they were would
[37:19] be in his prison right you know all the
[37:22] messages about souls in prison now and
[37:24] so on like that but that's what happened
[37:27] we all sitting here in bars of bone and
[37:29] even though you're born again even
[37:32] though you're saved don't tell me you're
[37:34] not going to feel any aches or pains
[37:36] brother but a bill
[37:37] don't tell me that if you hit your foot
[37:40] against a rock you're not gonna feel
[37:41] anything you're gonna have it amen but
[37:45] god even turned that around for his
[37:47] glory
[37:49] because then uh he let the world see how
[37:53] how a christian bears suffering trial
[37:56] problem sickness pain uh
[37:59] whatever evil failure uh success what he
[38:03] is letting the world see all those
[38:06] things through us
[38:08] and our weaknesses become his strengths
[38:11] because he can make himself manifest and
[38:14] reveal through that
[38:16] amen glory
[38:18] be to god hallelujah amen so you see god
[38:24] did not get the use
[38:26] of eve's
[38:29] womb
[38:30] to produce what he wanted we know abel
[38:34] was there but he did not get
[38:37] uh to produce what he wanted because
[38:40] remember in another place brother
[38:42] branham said you know if eve had obeyed
[38:45] the word and believed the word she would
[38:49] have produced that christ the messiah
[38:52] right back from the beginning there and
[38:54] we would not have to go through all of
[38:56] this
[38:57] amen praise god but because she didn't
[39:00] do it
[39:01] god
[39:02] already
[39:04] recognized he has to have that seed son
[39:07] of man seed to come up
[39:11] somewhere
[39:12] in the human history
[39:15] and therefore we understand carefully
[39:19] here
[39:20] that
[39:20] the great devil
[39:22] of god the holy spirit
[39:24] had to go searching
[39:27] to find a believing virgin
[39:30] amen praise god today he is searching
[39:33] for virgin hearts
[39:35] amen that would receive the word of god
[39:38] for this day and for this hour
[39:40] praise god listen it's the same thing
[39:43] that she uh um i mean
[39:46] mary got back there the spirit searched
[39:50] until it found that child amen to anoint
[39:54] and use her for his glory
[39:57] and the same spirit of the living god
[40:00] sent a prophet in this age amen and he
[40:03] stood before not mary back there but
[40:06] before a bride here today and spoke the
[40:09] word of god thus saith the lord there'll
[40:13] be a pride there'll be a rapture they
[40:15] all praise god they'll be sons and
[40:18] daughters of god and
[40:20] here they come praise god because the
[40:23] word attract their attention and brought
[40:25] them to attention of who they really are
[40:29] amen so the word of god in this last day
[40:33] has come to a virgin bride
[40:36] he has come to her and she has received
[40:40] the word of the living god
[40:42] amen do you remember he says here john 5
[40:47] 19
[40:48] how i do nothing till the father shows
[40:51] me
[40:52] what was he you see right there sure
[40:56] that though he was god
[40:58] meg made himself a man
[41:02] right praise god god made flesh dwelling
[41:06] among us
[41:07] the word was made flesh and dwelt among
[41:11] us
[41:12] god spoken word through a virgin was
[41:15] made flesh and dwelt among us and it
[41:19] brought forth a body
[41:21] amen and then dwelt in him praise god
[41:26] and there the life of god was
[41:29] manifesting through christ for god was
[41:33] in christ the anointed one you know
[41:36] christ means the anointed one or the
[41:38] anointed word
[41:40] amen and god was living in that praise
[41:45] god hallelujah amen and now we
[41:48] understand why the scripture says his
[41:50] name shall be called what emmanuel
[41:53] which is god
[41:55] with us but now we say emmanuel
[41:59] god in us praise god god in us making
[42:04] himself manifested to the world oh
[42:08] praise god how beautiful this is praise
[42:12] god now here we are brother sister like
[42:15] uh i think i've mentioned it before and
[42:17] was mentioned how that we really living
[42:20] in two worlds
[42:23] amen
[42:24] praise god we're living in two worlds
[42:28] praise god
[42:30] human
[42:32] producing flesh
[42:35] and then the word seed
[42:37] laying on the inside
[42:39] and there we are living in two realms
[42:42] you're in the earth here in the world
[42:44] you've seen everything that's going on
[42:46] all the temptations you're facing but at
[42:48] the same time there's a soul in there
[42:51] that is in contact with its maker
[42:53] hallelujah praise god amen and it's not
[42:57] worrying with all these distractions
[42:59] it's it's pressing on it's it's just
[43:02] pressing on its way because it's going
[43:04] back to glory
[43:06] hallelujah amen you see
[43:09] what is it now
[43:11] the germ with the flesh
[43:14] is now the anointed flesh anointed with
[43:18] the spirit of god producing the word of
[43:22] god may manifest
[43:25] praise god hallelujah amen yes sir
[43:29] oh
[43:30] be filled with his word
[43:32] believe his word
[43:34] then the holy spirit
[43:36] comes to water that word
[43:38] makes that word grow
[43:40] and god manifesting himself through that
[43:44] continues
[43:46] hallelujah
[43:48] you see
[43:50] i'm going ahead a little here but
[43:51] brother branham said he died
[43:54] to pay
[43:55] the debt
[43:57] for high breathing
[44:00] right
[44:01] high breathing he died to pay that debt
[44:05] hallelujah because you know that that
[44:07] was the cause of all sin all it's high
[44:10] breathing and what was the high
[44:11] breathing
[44:12] not a serpent
[44:14] with
[44:15] eve that's high breathing right there
[44:18] satan is the initiator of all hybriding
[44:21] he's the one that created that and so
[44:23] there he is
[44:25] the first uh opportunity and the first
[44:28] instance of our breathing is the serpent
[44:31] and eve
[44:32] right there it goes praise the lord all
[44:35] my diverting god's original
[44:39] plans praise god because god's real plan
[44:43] was to have sons and daughters like
[44:45] himself
[44:47] praise god but satan did something else
[44:51] believing he's going to trick god and as
[44:54] long as he gets some sons hybrid hybrid
[44:57] sons
[44:59] that
[45:00] they can act like like god's children
[45:03] and god no doubt will
[45:05] you know after a while say well it's not
[45:08] my child but i still like him he's a
[45:11] good behave boy a girl a moral man
[45:15] upright man an upright woman look at the
[45:18] good she does look how she feeds the
[45:20] poor but it doesn't matter i know god
[45:24] wouldn't think like that because it
[45:25] doesn't matter what you do when the
[45:28] blood of a father is in a child it
[45:30] doesn't matter how the father behave or
[45:32] the child behave the child is still not
[45:34] that man's a child
[45:36] no matter what
[45:37] it's there all the time that doesn't
[45:40] change hallelujah so
[45:43] that person can be holy on the outside
[45:45] of making themselves look like a
[45:47] christian but they go back to their
[45:50] father the devil
[45:52] and his works you will do amen you see
[45:56] oh my praise god hallelujah let me tell
[46:00] you brother sister listen now remember
[46:04] the work of his first son his only
[46:08] begotten son
[46:10] he died
[46:12] for our hybriding life
[46:15] see
[46:16] that he might reconcile us back to be
[46:20] sons and daughters of god
[46:22] right how did he do it
[46:25] amen how did he do it he was the word
[46:29] making itself manifested
[46:32] hallelujah and he
[46:34] gave his life that he might send back
[46:37] the spirit to water the seeds amen that
[46:41] was there in the earth praise god
[46:44] hallelujah lord of god he that believeth
[46:47] in me the words that i do
[46:49] praise god hallelujah oh my now somebody
[46:53] says why do you throw it upon the bible
[46:57] friends he said it's simply this the
[47:00] bible has got to be in you
[47:04] for the word is a seed
[47:07] i don't mean that you're going to take
[47:08] and eat this bible
[47:10] because you read in revelation when he
[47:12] says eat the book this is this is not
[47:15] what he's telling you to eat but the
[47:17] revelation that's in here god is telling
[47:20] you to eat that eat the book eat the
[47:23] word as far as that goes but what he's
[47:27] saying there and as long as this is
[47:30] laying in there
[47:32] it won't do nothing
[47:34] but when the holy spirit the water comes
[47:38] on that then it begins to do something
[47:41] amen praise god in other words you come
[47:44] an elected seed and you come with the
[47:46] bible and you're ready
[47:49] not not the book the bible but you come
[47:52] with the unwritten word inside of you
[47:54] and
[47:55] you don't know how you know
[47:58] how to act or what to do just like
[48:00] brother branham didn't know how he knows
[48:02] that person's name but god knows the
[48:05] person's name from beyond the foundation
[48:06] of the world already predestinate him to
[48:09] be a prophet so
[48:10] all he got to do is be a mouthpiece it's
[48:13] not as easy as i'm saying it because he
[48:15] told one brother that he said it takes
[48:17] faith to do it never mind you have a
[48:19] gift the gift doesn't mean you just
[48:22] like that you know god doesn't just work
[48:24] and move the person they gotta act by
[48:27] faith too right so he says you don't
[48:29] want anything like this
[48:31] because it's all faith but but the fact
[48:34] is the name is known to god
[48:37] hallelujah it's easiest thing for him to
[48:40] tell him
[48:44] and then he just repeat what he god just
[48:47] told him and it's got to be it will be
[48:49] right every time because you know it's
[48:51] not me it's not said the lord
[48:55] glory to god hallelujah think of it so
[48:59] when the bible is laying in there
[49:02] when it comes into the heart
[49:05] then it begins to manifest by the holy
[49:09] ghost
[49:10] the works of god
[49:13] that's when
[49:14] visions begin to come
[49:17] power begins to come
[49:20] humility comes
[49:23] all of your knowledge begins to go out
[49:27] and you
[49:28] begin to become nothing
[49:31] christ becomes alive
[49:33] because you die
[49:35] and he lives
[49:37] you let go and he has his way
[49:41] because he died i live when i die
[49:45] what happens he lives again
[49:48] praise god
[49:50] when we die he lives again
[49:52] that gives him god the chance now to
[49:55] manifest or express himself through the
[49:58] individual the believing individual
[50:00] praise the lord hallelujah amen oh
[50:04] praise god and when i die he promised me
[50:07] life i died out to myself that i can
[50:10] have his life i'm taking his word now
[50:14] praise god and by that by faith
[50:17] believing it it produces exactly what
[50:21] the bible said it would produce
[50:25] hallelujah
[50:26] praise god i'm just going to go over
[50:28] quick something here he's just said in
[50:30] passing which anybody can expand on that
[50:33] if they can think
[50:35] oh my brethren
[50:37] we find now a lot of imitations
[50:43] is that right
[50:45] imitations of christ
[50:47] you know that famous book written by
[50:51] some great writer the imitations of
[50:54] christ the catholic loves it
[50:57] but that is what's actually going on
[51:00] imitations of christ
[51:04] trying to make themselves look like a
[51:07] christian act like a christian talk like
[51:09] a christian on that way praise god but
[51:12] the true word heavens and earth will
[51:15] pass away
[51:17] my words will not pass away
[51:19] that's the written word that's the
[51:20] living word the same word but it's not
[51:23] going to pass away because it's eternal
[51:26] to begin with praise god hallelujah
[51:29] that's why oh my i come out of that
[51:32] years ago when we used to be so uh you
[51:35] know
[51:36] really strong comforting to your heart
[51:39] to know i got born again on november the
[51:44] 21st
[51:46] 1955 or whatever you got the date you
[51:50] know the time and everything else like
[51:52] until the holy spirit starts speaking
[51:55] and saying like speaking he spoke to
[51:57] others but he's speaking to me saying
[51:59] does anybody know when they're born
[52:02] do not know the date
[52:04] the other day
[52:06] the mother the father got to tell them
[52:08] but when they were born they didn't know
[52:11] and you don't need to do that but it's
[52:13] your actions your character your
[52:16] motivations everything is going to begin
[52:18] to tell you you're changed
[52:21] you're not the same man or woman you
[52:24] used to be
[52:25] your taste is different everything's
[52:27] changed you've been transformed by god's
[52:30] power amen hallelujah so we got that
[52:34] heaven earth will pass away but my word
[52:38] will not pass away hallelujah because
[52:42] they are as predestinated
[52:45] as he
[52:46] was
[52:48] amen
[52:49] praise god
[52:50] hallelujah he's saying jesus christ
[52:54] was predestinated
[52:57] to be the messiah to be the savior that
[53:00] was what he was purpose of coming here
[53:02] to do you know a lot of his prayers
[53:03] saying father i fulfilled
[53:05] you know the mission you gave me that to
[53:08] die i did this i i've declared your name
[53:12] he came with a mission he was
[53:14] predestinated
[53:16] and he says here he says now we know
[53:20] that word seed was flesh
[53:23] word seed flesh
[53:25] now
[53:26] we see
[53:28] predestinated sons and daughters
[53:31] of god
[53:32] they are also predestinated you believe
[53:36] that
[53:37] amen praise god hallelujah ephesians 1
[53:41] 5 verse 5 amen original seed
[53:45] predestinated because we were
[53:48] predestinated
[53:50] in gods for knowledge
[53:53] in other words satan threw the whole
[53:56] thing off track
[53:57] but before he even threw it off track
[54:00] god already knew he was going to throw
[54:01] it off track and god had a contingency
[54:04] plan
[54:05] is that right
[54:07] so god had a contingency plan so god
[54:10] just put it into motion that's why we
[54:13] read the scripture of genesis 3 15.
[54:16] immediately after she sinned god tells
[54:19] tells her how that the seed you're right
[54:22] you're telling the serpent your your
[54:24] seed is going to bruise his head but
[54:26] he's going to bruise your eel amen and
[54:28] so so god had a plan that now the woman
[54:32] seed is the emphasis i wanted to bring
[54:34] because the woman has no seed
[54:36] that was already showing he was going to
[54:39] send that word seed now to untrue a
[54:43] woman
[54:44] right because sin came by and true a
[54:47] woman
[54:48] he's going to correct the whole thing by
[54:50] sending the word seed now in and through
[54:54] a woman
[54:55] bringing back life to the world
[54:57] hallelujah praise god that's what he's
[55:00] saying here amen see
[55:02] that original seed christ is that
[55:05] original seed you believe it
[55:09] now think the original seed was
[55:13] predestinated by gods for knowledge
[55:16] but i just told you god already foreign
[55:19] and knew what the devil was gonna do and
[55:21] everything else and had a contingency
[55:23] plan all right and god knowing that the
[55:27] fall would come here it is
[55:29] knowing that the fall would come and
[55:32] predestinated
[55:34] him
[55:35] to take our place
[55:38] amen
[55:39] you get it
[55:41] so all sons and daughters of god are
[55:46] predestined
[55:49] you can't be a genuine son or daughter
[55:52] of god unless you were
[55:55] pre-destinated by god
[55:58] hallelujah not forced to do something on
[56:00] the earth but god knew you in his mind
[56:06] and he knew everything you were going to
[56:08] do and everything you were going to be
[56:10] god knew all about that praise god amen
[56:14] so he knows us by name even before we
[56:17] come down here right we know that
[56:19] because he told jeremiah he said before
[56:21] you even was in your mother's stomach i
[56:24] i know you i i know you uh i know you i
[56:27] even know you're calling i know what
[56:29] you're supposed to do when you come down
[56:30] here you're to be a prophet you you're
[56:32] to do this god knew every one of us
[56:36] hallelujah praise god amen
[56:40] oh praise god you see you must not
[56:44] realize
[56:47] that god knew
[56:49] them seeds would be here and you are
[56:52] here on free moral agency he for you
[56:56] everything that we would be
[56:59] and he even knowed who you
[57:02] were and who you was amen praise god so
[57:06] god knows all his genes
[57:08] just like that mother eagle knew all her
[57:11] children where every egg was everything
[57:13] he knows exactly where they are
[57:17] now
[57:19] think on this
[57:20] he says
[57:23] he did not make eve do that what she did
[57:29] that is not the kind of predestination
[57:31] we're not talking about that god don't
[57:33] force didn't force her to do nothing
[57:38] right
[57:39] he but he know
[57:41] that she would have done that
[57:45] and because he knew what the devil would
[57:48] have done what she would have done and
[57:50] everything else he already had his plan
[57:54] for the lamb was slain already before
[57:58] the foundation of the world
[58:01] so god already had his plan the land was
[58:04] slain before all of this stuff actually
[58:07] took place down here
[58:09] the lamb was slain for our sins praise
[58:11] god hallelujah oh how wonderful to know
[58:16] that amen my god no wonder he says here
[58:22] they got eyes but they don't see
[58:24] they got ears but they don't hear
[58:27] amen that's why jesus himself said you
[58:31] are hypocrites
[58:33] you are good imitations of christ i'm
[58:36] saying that now your your good
[58:38] limitations of christ you you got so
[58:41] you good imitation you look so holy so
[58:44] christ-like so
[58:46] pious and everything else and you you're
[58:49] repellent
[58:50] brother bran says here repellent to the
[58:52] true word of god oh my yes that's the
[58:57] way it is you're refusing the word of
[59:00] god hallelujah but how does
[59:03] predestinated come you see god had
[59:06] commissioned adam and eve
[59:09] to multiply and replenish the earth
[59:12] amen
[59:13] and
[59:14] we see satan use that that is how sex
[59:18] was given
[59:19] but and that caused a high breathing
[59:22] amen my but now god already foresaw and
[59:27] predestinated a world of son and
[59:30] daughters to come
[59:33] hallelujah amen he predestinated them to
[59:37] be here
[59:39] and because of my breathing disbelieving
[59:42] god's word which caused that high
[59:44] breeding god put that right back on
[59:48] track again
[59:50] hallelujah you don't have to be a hybrid
[59:54] or think you're a hybrid amen praise god
[59:58] you can come to the original word
[1:00:01] and manifest that you are a child of the
[1:00:05] living god hallelujah right back to the
[1:00:08] word and where you're supposed to be in
[1:00:11] the beginning
[1:00:13] hallelujah
[1:00:14] my that's where we were supposed to be
[1:00:17] and you will automatically act
[1:00:20] and move
[1:00:21] like the son
[1:00:23] and daughter of god hallelujah now he
[1:00:26] says have you ever heard of anything
[1:00:30] like a strain
[1:00:31] being in a family
[1:00:33] a certain strain
[1:00:35] being in the family have you ever heard
[1:00:37] of that
[1:00:38] a son
[1:00:40] or a daughter or ever will have traits
[1:00:43] of a grandmother a grandfather or a
[1:00:45] great-great-grandfather he'll have uh
[1:00:48] he'll have that we see like that some
[1:00:51] kind of a
[1:00:52] family
[1:00:54] identifying traits that in that family
[1:00:57] that they don't have to
[1:00:59] they don't have to be taught that
[1:01:02] they don't have to be trained to have
[1:01:04] that nature that family nature
[1:01:08] these families that
[1:01:09] they they're quiet
[1:01:11] and there are other families that are
[1:01:13] they talk and they move
[1:01:15] families with long fingers like artists
[1:01:18] and other ones
[1:01:19] different ways every family has its own
[1:01:23] strain
[1:01:25] and you can't escape from it the the
[1:01:28] children of that family
[1:01:30] don't have to be given a bible school
[1:01:32] education to act like abraham or act
[1:01:35] like this one or act like a jones or a
[1:01:38] smith or whatever they're just born in
[1:01:41] that family
[1:01:42] and they automatically act like that
[1:01:44] family
[1:01:46] and you pure predestinated sons and
[1:01:49] daughters of god from the original
[1:01:51] family of god when the spirit of god
[1:01:54] comes to you you'll act like a son or
[1:01:56] daughter of god
[1:01:58] because the spirit will make you do it
[1:02:01] amen
[1:02:02] oh praise god no matter what you do you
[1:02:06] can't hide your family disposition
[1:02:09] is that right
[1:02:10] you can help to hide that you see he
[1:02:13] repeats it he said remember that
[1:02:16] there's always a strain in a family now
[1:02:21] he really is talking about the family of
[1:02:23] god here but it's left for you to read
[1:02:25] between the lines and pick that up and
[1:02:27] understand that god's family is
[1:02:29] automatically going to have certain
[1:02:32] actions you're not going to be you are
[1:02:34] not going to be jesus christ
[1:02:37] but there's going to be some similarity
[1:02:39] and some little thing
[1:02:41] that you do or say that will be like him
[1:02:44] certain situations come up when the
[1:02:46] normal thing in the world
[1:02:48] is to act like the world
[1:02:50] you don't even know why you said it why
[1:02:52] you did it this way why you acted that
[1:02:54] way because you got the family's traits
[1:02:57] in you and there's something and you're
[1:02:59] moving you to do that
[1:03:01] and it's not something that you have to
[1:03:03] think about it just flows out from you
[1:03:06] praise god hallelujah oh is that
[1:03:09] wonderful amen you come with the family
[1:03:13] seed inside of you the strain of god's
[1:03:16] life already inside of us hallelujah so
[1:03:20] we
[1:03:21] what i'm hitting at here
[1:03:23] we don't have to strain and struggle
[1:03:28] to live a real christian life
[1:03:31] my yoke is easy
[1:03:33] and my burden
[1:03:35] is light
[1:03:37] you use the word burden but you say it's
[1:03:39] light
[1:03:40] praise the lord you're gonna know that
[1:03:42] you're getting tests and trials but it's
[1:03:44] going to be light
[1:03:46] why because god's life is in you
[1:03:50] straightening you moving you so we don't
[1:03:52] have to strain or struggle hallelujah
[1:03:56] amen i
[1:03:58] go to go to uh bible school and learn
[1:04:02] how to be a leblanc
[1:04:04] is that right uh go over to this higher
[1:04:07] bible school they're going to do a
[1:04:08] better job in training me how to act
[1:04:10] like a christian
[1:04:12] how to be an apostle how to be a
[1:04:15] missionary they they got all their books
[1:04:18] and their training classes to train them
[1:04:20] and that's satan using systems
[1:04:24] in the mental realm
[1:04:26] right he's using them to act and when
[1:04:29] they act by systems they become
[1:04:30] predictable
[1:04:32] because the devil knew exactly because
[1:04:33] he taught you the system he knew exactly
[1:04:36] what the next move you're going to make
[1:04:37] but john 3 says true sons of god oh
[1:04:42] they're like the wind true sons of god
[1:04:44] they're moved by the spirit of god the
[1:04:47] wind lord where listed and no man knows
[1:04:49] where it goes where is coming from where
[1:04:51] it's going hallelujah because it's
[1:04:54] moving by the spirit of the living god
[1:04:56] praise god amen oh praise god i'm going
[1:05:01] to just wind this up here now
[1:05:04] amen says brother branham if that is so
[1:05:08] then why what's the use of us preaching
[1:05:12] predestination
[1:05:14] what's the use of us preaching
[1:05:16] he says yes
[1:05:18] preaching
[1:05:20] i've got to preach you've got to preach
[1:05:23] because there's a crop out there
[1:05:26] and we don't know who
[1:05:28] is in that crop is that right
[1:05:31] amen so the only thing i am doing here
[1:05:34] now
[1:05:35] is saying you know what a saying is
[1:05:38] it it's a net
[1:05:40] is throwing out the net
[1:05:42] and then he's gonna sort the fish like
[1:05:44] jesus said uh what is in the fish so you
[1:05:48] can preach the word and this church full
[1:05:50] up and people are bursting at the seams
[1:05:53] standing outside and as you get deeper
[1:05:55] and deeper and deeper and deeper in the
[1:05:56] world
[1:05:58] all the snakes all the crabs all this
[1:06:01] all of that they start crawling off
[1:06:04] because what they can't take the
[1:06:07] fullness of that word
[1:06:10] they can't just take the fullness of
[1:06:12] that word see that's the way it is amen
[1:06:16] praise god so i'm saying
[1:06:19] here now
[1:06:20] see going through all this grease and
[1:06:23] muck and you see my goodness but if
[1:06:26] there's even one out there
[1:06:28] one that can absorb this
[1:06:31] it will turn out to be
[1:06:33] that that would be a son or a daughter
[1:06:37] of god and it's predestinated
[1:06:40] amen
[1:06:41] and that's the reason why
[1:06:44] god could work through jesus
[1:06:46] for he was pre-death the predestinated
[1:06:50] son hallelujah praise god
[1:06:53] you know the messages of preach on
[1:06:57] prepared
[1:06:58] ground and how god to manifest in a
[1:07:02] certain age prepared
[1:07:05] certain
[1:07:06] persons elected to be in that age so
[1:07:09] when he comes
[1:07:11] their bodies waiting for him to use
[1:07:13] so jesus was predestinated to be the
[1:07:16] savior and redeemer
[1:07:18] and now we understand that in our day he
[1:07:22] produced
[1:07:23] he prophesied there would be a bride
[1:07:25] that will go in a rapture
[1:07:27] and he has predestinated a set of people
[1:07:30] to be in that bride and to be in that
[1:07:33] rapture
[1:07:34] and i believe i'm a part of it
[1:07:37] i believe you're a part of it i believe
[1:07:39] together we are a part of it there is
[1:07:42] nobody else but us that are here believe
[1:07:45] in the word of god and we're not hanging
[1:07:47] on we're believing
[1:07:49] we're holding to god's unchanging hand
[1:07:52] praise god we're not just like some
[1:07:55] kitten or cat that's hanging by one
[1:07:57] fingernail and uh
[1:07:59] i believe i'm gonna make it i i hope i
[1:08:02] make it oh jesus help me oh jesus help
[1:08:05] me no
[1:08:06] not like that we're standing on a solid
[1:08:09] rock revelation of the word of the
[1:08:11] living god
[1:08:13] amen praise god amen hallelujah remember
[1:08:18] he says
[1:08:20] before the foundation before even eden
[1:08:26] he
[1:08:26] jesus
[1:08:28] was already
[1:08:30] predestinated to his position
[1:08:33] predestinated
[1:08:35] to his purpose
[1:08:37] predestinated hallelujah for his purpose
[1:08:40] in this life praise god hallelujah amen
[1:08:45] don't you understand he's talking about
[1:08:46] the other sons but he's talking this son
[1:08:49] because we were all in him so when he
[1:08:51] talks about jesus he's actually talking
[1:08:53] also about all the other sons and
[1:08:55] daughters that were in him praise god
[1:08:58] that he already you predestinated with
[1:09:00] your position
[1:09:02] you're pus you're already predestinated
[1:09:04] with your purpose
[1:09:06] in this life so you don't have to go
[1:09:09] around uh worrying about lord what is my
[1:09:12] purpose what is my position am i
[1:09:16] supposed to be this or that no
[1:09:18] when you come here you're born you're
[1:09:20] put on the earth the word calls you you
[1:09:22] come into the message you come into the
[1:09:24] the word of god it automatically
[1:09:28] moves you into your position
[1:09:31] listen i thought i would have been an
[1:09:32] apostle
[1:09:34] and god only wants me to be a believer
[1:09:38] to support the ministry or god want me
[1:09:41] to be
[1:09:42] a wife or god wants me to be a husband
[1:09:46] or god wants me to be
[1:09:48] this or that whatever it's that simple
[1:09:52] is that right
[1:09:53] praise the lord he said anything god
[1:09:55] wants you to be
[1:09:57] you are going to be that and you're
[1:09:59] going to know it

[1:10:08] i'll have to go to saint john's college
[1:10:11] you see that's where they're off
[1:10:14] and they don't realize it because it's
[1:10:16] too high and mighty sounding
[1:10:18] right but god wants you to come down
[1:10:22] and to make the low places high
[1:10:24] and the high places low god bless you
[1:10:27] all

[1:10:54] in the recovery state where you know
[1:10:57] that state where the doctors
[1:11:00] really can't do anything anymore they
[1:11:02] themselves have to wait as they say
[1:11:05] now they have to wait on nature
[1:11:08] they did the best they could
[1:11:10] and now they're waiting on nature
[1:11:12] but we say they're waiting on god
[1:11:15] they're waiting on healing and we
[1:11:18] already prayed and pronounced that
[1:11:20] healing
[1:11:21] so we are waiting and trusting god for
