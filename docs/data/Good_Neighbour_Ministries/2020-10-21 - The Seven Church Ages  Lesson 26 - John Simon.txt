TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends and thank you for being here what a great honor to be here with you in the presence of the living god hallelujah now uh my talk today will be brief and to the point and trusting that god will use it to bless your heart and your life glory to his marvelous name we shall read out of the book of revelation chapter 2 verse 7 let us read out of the blessed word of god he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcome commit will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the garden of god now may god bless us today as we continue our wonderful talks um on the seven church ages we have just uh concluded our last talk speaking about the nickelodeons and nickelodeonism now we identified it starting from nicholas in the church age of ephesus and he founded this but that was just the natural start of it up on the earth nickelodeonism in actual fact the seeds of nickelodeonism were planted in the earth in and through nicolas satan planted it for he was the first one with that rebel spirit in heaven we are told how much that he tried to use negligenism in the sense that he dominated over about one-third of the angels and tried to permeate his influence upon all of them with his lies and profusion of deceit and deception and after a while controlling them he created an atmosphere of uh rebellion and subversion of the kingdom of heaven and under this as you know there was a great war in heaven and michael fought against lucifer satan and his angels of darkness so the hosts of heaven were in a great battle against the armies of darkness the armies of darkness were defeated conclusively by michael thanks be to god and the angels of god and the bible said he was kicked out he was cast out of heaven cast out ignominious defeat cast out there in shame and degradation this mighty great angel that once was in the presence of god was cast down from the glories of heaven to the filth to thee to the evils of the world below actually he turned the entire thing filthy and evil as his personality and character is my point here is to detail or outline to you that nicolasism is not just a happening but it had its very beginnings its genesis was right in heaven came to earth and nicolas happened to be the one used to proliferate it now i want to be able to touch on the serpent's seed you might have heard about the doctrine or mystery of the serpent's seed you may have been told that eve at an apple you might have been told that it was not an apple it happened to be a pair and so various uh ideas thoughts and presumptions of man like that have been told through the ages until they have become like folklore uh stories that are in the bible but this is not so for in actual fact we know what happened and we will introduce that here today what happened in the garden of eden introduced to you how the serpent inserted himself and was able to obscene a seed child and was able then to infect the entire earth with the virus of sin now we realize friends as we have read in our scripture revelation 2 7 to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the garden of god now this is the reward of all overcomers from the past now and even in the future for it's for the overcomers of all ages and friends when the last sounding and called the battle by the trumpet of god has been sounded and when all our armor is laid down then we shall rest in the paradise of god and our portion will be the tree of life forever amen tree of life now the term tree of life is mentioned three times in genesis and again three times in the book of revelation and in all six places it symbolizes represents and types the very same thing you say well what is the tree of life well what does a tree stand for everywhere we can read it in the bible numbers 24 6 balaam describes israel trees of lion aloes which the lord had planted now trees throughout the scriptures referred to people or to persons or to a person as it does in the book of psalms chapter 1 which begins blessed is the man then it goes onto says he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters psalm chapter 1 verses 1 to 3 you will find that there now in the garden of eden we understand that there were two trees standing in the midst of the garden one was the tree of life and the other was the tree of knowledge of good and evil according to our bible records man was supposed to live by the tree of life but he was not supposed to touch or partake of the tree of knowledge of evil for the result of his touching would be death now we know that death of course entered into him by sin and how that by sin man became separated from god now the tree of life that was in the garden that tree which is the source of life and as we have said before the tree is a type a representation or symbol of persons or a person now this tree of life is a type of christ a type of jesus christ who was in the garden in john chapter six through eight jesus himself identifying himself as being that tree of life because he sets himself forth as the source of all spiritual and natural life he called himself the bread that came down from heaven he spoke of giving life to man that if a man ate up this bread he would live forever and would not die he said i he knew abraham and he said abraham knew him and abraham longed to see his coming in flesh long to see his day and the bible says and abraham saw it by vision and abraham saw it and rejoiced to a savior of of his children of his seed was coming on the scene and that is why of course jesus was able to identify uh the spirits that were on the pharisees and the sadducees that they were satanic and they were of the serpent's seed and that they were evil you are of your father the devil for he's a liar from the beginning this is what jesus said you see before abraham was he was i am he identified himself as the great i am he prophesied that he would give living waters to men to drink that if they were to drink they will never never be able to thirst again and would live eternally oh praise god he is the great i am he's the bread of life he is the rock in the wilderness he is the tree in the garden in the midst of the garden in the paradise of god he is jesus the wonderful and lovely lord and savior jesus christ now some scholars do believe that we are making much ado about nothing they believe that these two trees were just two ordinary trees but i beg to differ god's word differs from what they're thinking these two trees were not two ordinary trees one my friends of course we know was jesus glory to god hallelujah listen what the scripture says here from the scriptures john the baptist said that axe was led to the root of the trees he was not speaking of natural trees but of spiritual trees and spiritual principles upon which his acts was being laid first john uh 5 11 says and this is the record that god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son life in the tree of life now with the bible says the life is in his son so the son was that tree right so here we are uh first john 5 14 and ye will not come to me that you might have life praise god so the record of the word shows that eternal life is in the son which is the lord jesus christ for it says he that hat the sun hut life and he that had not the son hut not life praise god the word doesn't change the record remains the same that life is in the sun and so we know life in the tree of life life in the sun and we realize that son is none other than our lord jesus christ for he was that tree standing in the midst of the garden now let us approach the beginning of this revelation this expose of the satan manifesting himself through the serpent seed by allowing himself since god had a son he had to have one too and so let's look at that the bible tells us in the book of genesis that eve was beguiled by the serpent we know that means she was actually seduced by the serpent let's use another word here she was defiled by the serpent it says in genesis 3 chapter 1 now the serpent was more subtle wise intelligent oh then any other beast of the field which the lord god had made he was more subtle than any other beast he was more subtle than any other beast of the field or any animal of the field which the lord god had made now we know this beast was close to being a human being and yet he was an animal a pure beast the reason why he was close to being like a human being he looked like one what like one talked like one subtle reason like one intelligent he was an upright creature he walked like a man and was somewhat between a chimpanzee or ape and the man in fact he was and still is the missing link that they are searching and digging around for but you see he was closer to being a man now this is the origin of high breeding this is the origin of nicolasianism and its insertion into the entire human race so you see he was so close to being a human being between beasts and man that he was able to mingle his seed with a human being he could mingle his seed with the woman and create a conception now when that happened according to our bible god cursed the serpent cursed the cooperators chris the woman curse the ground the three that were in cooperation with this evil act of defilement beguilement seduction by this serpent this beast that appeared like a man but was a beast in his soul a beast in his being and here it was that he changed god by his curse changed every bone in the serpent's body and he saw he couldn't walk anymore he had to crawl now we know he was upright for the bible tells us clearly from this day which means from before or the times before he was not on his belly he walked like a man and talked like a man but because of his evil sin this perpetration of evil god said from this day on your belly shalt thou go and god cursed him changed every bone in this body cause him to crawl upon the ground like a snake remember the bible calls the serpent but after it was cursed then snake he was called the snake now science wants and they're doing everything to try to find that missing uh link that they're searching for and this isn't any evolution they've gone into all kinds of false pseudosciences calling it uh evolution and they're looking for the evolution and there's no such a thing as evolution god created man man was made man did not ever loot but that is the they're finding the the evidences some evidences of the serpent seed which looked like a man between a man and an ape and was able to walk and talk but was cursed by the living god and placed upon his belly and god said from this day on your belly shalt thou go of course this is one of the mysteries of the living god that happened in eden when eve turned away from the tree of life up from the tree of knowledge in other words satan had knowledge of her and then that brought death sin upon the earth upon this specific time now friends listen what god says in genesis 3 15 i will put enmity between thee that's the serpent and the woman and between thy seed and her seed to this day there is a fear of women and snakes i will put enmity between the and the woman and between thy seed and her seed this of course also speaks spiritually between the church and satan and between the the children of the bride of the wife of christ and the seed of the serpent also it speaks about that enmity and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now that is speaking of course the woman's seed being jesus christ for no women have a seed of ourselves we know that that's really the seed of god that passed through the woman because jesus was not from mary he was he just passed through mary mary was a vessel ordained predestinated blessed and used by god to be the conduit that jesus christ might be here on the face of the earth so we see that if we were to think carefully between the woman's seed and i see the bible is telling you it's not i'm not telling you william branham is not just telling you the bible is telling you there was the woman's seed and there was and is this serpent seed it's in your bible just read it for yourself in genesis chapter 3 15. so we know that the serpent surely had and still has a seed oh man my if the seed of the woman was a man-child that came on the earth apart from man then the seed of the serpent will also have to be the same thing a man-child that came on the earth apart from the instrumentality of man we know every bible student no student knows that the seed of the woman was jesus christ and is jesus christ and he came by the instrumentality of god seed planted by the spoken word and not by human intercourse but by the pure spoken word of god gabriel standing before mary thou shalt bear a son and his name shall be called jesus for he shall save the people from their sins and the word of god caught in the womb and the word of god became flesh by the spoken word spoken word to living word the word met flesh in jesus christ and he walked up on the earth and displayed the character and characteristics of personality of the living god praise be to god now we know friends as we look into the word of god that this literal serpent seed was sown upon the earth just as jesus was sown upon the earth but one was so sown or planted or placed here by god while the serpent seed was placed here by the instrumentality of satan manifesting and operating himself through a beast that had the shape and form and looks like a man for as you go into the world you'll find that he was beautiful snakes still are and he was charming and snakes still charm birds my friends in every way we see the parallelism we see the character that's right there with the serpent's seed and so we see that he had to get his seed here apart from the instrumentality of a man and so he used the beast the snake that is what he used to be able to copycat and to pervert that which god had already done and so praise god hallelujah the bible tells us clearly how that gabriel spoke the word to mary and how the word of god came to pass and that it was god actually reproducing himself in the human race god injecting placing himself in flesh for the word was made flesh john chapter 1 for the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us glory be to god it was god reproducing himself so satan's serpent seed had to literally be him inserting himself also within the bloodstream of the human race he found an open door that door was the woman and since it was impossible for him to create for he himself is a created spirit being that has a beginning and will have him his end in the lake of fire the pits of hell he will find his end there he is not eternal he had a beginning he is a created being he's a loser from the beginning for he lost the war and he is still a loser he just doesn't know it as yet but he will lose it and the bride is prophesied that she will overcome him by the word of the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony thanks be unto god glory to his marvelous and wonderful name now friends by his seed of injection into the human race this serpent before adam had carnal knowledge of eve the serpent this tree of knowledge of good and evil had knowledge of eve before adam did and the one that was born from that population that one that was born from that was named cain according to the bible for first john chapter 3 verse 12 it says for cain who was of that wicked one so cain was the son of the serpent it's in your bible first john chapter 3 verse 12 cain son of the serpent begotten of that evil one injected in the human race and placed here upon the earth the bible tells us clearly in another place that adam was the son of god for he was by original creation luke chapter 3 verse 8 38 and we find out that cain showed his characteristics exactly like that of lucifer that evil satanic being that was there in the great eons of time and so he was a father of lies he was a bringer of death as the bible said he was a murderer from the beginning as jesus said you are of your father the devil for he was a murderer from the beginning what was that it was satan created a son like god had a son and god dwelt in the sun satan got his son by eve the son's name was came but it was satan that was in him still fighting the greatest battle ever fought which started in heaven came to the earth and the contest continued on from that time and we see here in the word of god his character let me repeat just like his father the devil a liar a bringer of death a murderer and a defiant one against the will and word of the living god in other words he was born a rebel as he was in the heavenlies so is he upon the earth the spirit of a rebel that loves has a wonder lust loves to wonder here and wander there and when he's asked in the bible when's coming stop from going to and fro to and fro to and fro he just loves to wander about and has the spirit of a rebel and here he was defiant in the bible when he faced the almighty god and genesis chapter 4 verses 5 9 13 and 12 showed how cain was so sub-human on human in his reactions to god the bible says god speaking but unto cain and to his offering he had no respect and cain was very roth in other words he got angry with god just think of it a human being a creation of god getting angry with god and his countenance fell and the lord said unto cain where is a bell thy brother and he said i know not this rebel spirit in him i know not uh i don't know am i my brother's keeper the spirit of the rebellion disobedience offensive oh my think of it and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond upon the earth think of it satan's separate seed vagabonds rebels renegades upon the earth and it shall come to pass that everyone that find that me shall slay me wherever they will find me now in our next talk we will speak my friends twins in the beginning twins in the end we will continue on this topic of the serpent seed and expand upon it before we can get to see what great rewards and blessings god has in store for all those that love him do you love him i love him as the songwriter says i love him i love him because he first loved me and purchased my salvation on cal breeze tree thank you gracious heavenly father for the word of god that has gone forth we pray lord jesus that the word of god will take deep roots create a thirst lord for your word in the name of jesus send forth thy light and thy truth around the world wherever the word of god will be found and call out your selected elected seed of god the chosen ones oh praise god forevermore call them out we pray by the opening of the word for we ask it in the name of jesus christ we ask your blessing upon every hearer everyone that's watching at this time may the spirit of almighty god rest upon them may you lift up your countenance upon them and grant them peace now and forevermore in the name of our lord jesus christ amen god bless you until next week next wednesday when we continue on this subject the mystery or
