[0:18] and I'm here again with you today I will
[0:26] be conducting the Lord's Supper better
[0:31] known as communion the Lord richly bless
[0:35] you today with this meditation
[0:39] let us read out all the scriptures and
[0:44] as they were eating Jesus took bread and
[0:50] blessed it and brake it and gave it to
[0:54] the disciples and said take eat this is
[1:00] my body and he took the cup and gave
[1:03] thanks and gave them saying drink ye all
[1:09] of it for this is my blood of the New
[1:14] Testament which is shed for many for the
[1:19] remission of sins little spring our
[1:24] gracious Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:29] for this marvelous gift of yourself
[1:35] coming down to earth to die for us in
[1:40] the form of Jesus Christ or Lord take
[1:45] all the glory and praise Ananda and
[1:47] bless this marvelous communion service
[1:52] to us in Jesus name Amen and amen
[1:58] well today this evening friends I would
[2:03] certainly love to speak to you on the
[2:08] significance of communion
[2:11] as they were eating the scripture said
[2:18] on the night before Jesus was crucified
[2:25] he and 12 of the disciples went into the
[2:30] upper room to observe their last meal
[2:34] together
[2:35] better known as the Last Supper at the
[2:40] end of the supper Jesus picked up a
[2:45] piece of bread and instituted the first
[2:50] communion
[2:51] there ever was bread was used but what
[2:57] kind of bread it wasn't just any kind of
[3:00] bread
[3:01] it was unleavened bread now the law of
[3:06] Moses had commanded that the Jews will
[3:12] use unleavened bread and they do to this
[3:17] very day at their pass over celebrations
[3:23] here is what Paul said your glorying is
[3:28] not good knowing not what a little
[3:33] leaven leaveneth the whole lump purge
[3:37] out therefore the old leaven that you
[3:40] may be a new lump as you are on limb for
[3:46] even Christ our Passover is sacrificed
[3:50] for us therefore let us keep the feast
[3:55] not with old leaven neither with the
[3:59] leaven of malice and wickedness but the
[4:04] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[4:10] now we understand in those times when
[4:15] Moses commanded that they should use
[4:19] unleavened bread leaven of course we
[4:23] know today
[4:24] yeast what and it was to be taken out or
[4:29] purged out of the house of every Jew and
[4:34] we must purge out sin wickedness evil in
[4:39] sincerity dishonesty lies first them out
[4:44] completely out of our lives so first of
[4:49] all when we come together to take the
[4:53] Lord's Supper better known as communion
[4:57] we must first of all take the bread into
[5:01] our hands in a spiritual sense this is
[5:08] where communion begins
[5:10] he gives the bread but we must take it
[5:13] God gives the word but we must accept it
[5:17] he gives the revelation we must receive
[5:21] it we must voluntarily take God's Word
[5:25] we must voluntarily accept the
[5:28] revelation of this day none of this hour
[5:31] within our hearts we cannot partake of
[5:35] this great sacrifice of our Lord Jesus
[5:39] amen we cannot do it by ourselves just
[5:43] by ourselves but by faith he gives it to
[5:48] us and we must receive it within our
[5:52] hearts and that revelation of the word
[5:55] of God changes our entire lives now we
[5:59] know according to the scriptures Jesus
[6:01] said I am the bread of life Jesus is the
[6:05] bread of life he gave his life for us
[6:09] that we might live and we ought to
[6:13] receive him as the Living bread of life
[6:16] within our hearts and humble ourselves
[6:20] before him confessing our faults before
[6:23] him surrendering our lives to him that
[6:27] he may become our not only our Savior
[6:30] but the
[6:31] more lies let us confess our
[6:34] unworthiness let us confess our sin to
[6:39] him let us ask the Lord Jesus to come
[6:43] into our hearts as Lord and Master of
[6:47] our lives amen
[6:50] today as I speak pick up the bread that
[6:53] he has given to us
[6:55] pick up the revelation that he has given
[6:58] to us and take it into your heart now
[7:02] Jesus is represented in the unleavened
[7:08] bread for the Bible tells us he was
[7:12] without sin
[7:14] totally unleavened without any sin
[7:18] whatsoever
[7:19] whatever level is a form of course of
[7:23] corruption East the mixture gives a lot
[7:27] of flavor and in sin there is a pleasure
[7:31] of sin but the ends thereof are the ways
[7:36] of death so let us live lives that were
[7:40] unleavened and cleanse from the leaven
[7:44] of sin corruption that is within the
[7:48] heart of man it is a sin friends when we
[7:53] live contrary to the Word of God it is
[7:57] sin in the art of man that causes him to
[8:02] rebuild against God as in the Garden of
[8:06] Eden this rebellion of this modern day
[8:09] filled with pride arrogance and loins
[8:14] and tremendous entrace come instead of
[8:19] thanking God for His grace man repels
[8:23] against God and even blames God for the
[8:27] misfortunes that he has created upon his
[8:32] own self we must clean out sin for our
[8:36] lives we must do this and trust in him
[8:40] and him alone by receiving the blood
[8:43] the lamb or blessing Lord Jesus Christ
[8:46] within our hearts and ask him for the
[8:49] remission of our sins now Jesus this
[8:56] great one this first step in taking of
[9:01] the Lord's Supper is that we must
[9:03] cleanse our hearts from sin we must have
[9:09] Jesus come within our lives and ask him
[9:13] to be the savior of our souls it is only
[9:17] by the repenting of our sins and
[9:19] receiving him within her heart that we
[9:23] are prepared to pick up this bread of
[9:26] life
[9:27] pick up the Word of God pick up the
[9:30] revelation of God's Word for your day
[9:33] and a message for your day Jesus of
[9:37] course as the Bible tells us took up the
[9:41] bread and He blessed it He blessed the
[9:48] bread now we know that no Jew would
[9:53] think of eating without blessing
[9:57] whatever they eat there are very
[10:00] religious people very believing people
[10:03] in the great Jehovah who spoke to them
[10:07] and said hear o Israel the Lord thy God
[10:09] is one Lord they are believing people
[10:14] just as we as Christians are with all
[10:17] our faults all our failures our mistakes
[10:20] we try to be a believing people our
[10:24] mistakes may be many but we are a
[10:28] believing people and we want to come to
[10:31] God and ask for his cleansing and for
[10:34] His forgiveness now on this Memorial Day
[10:38] of the Passover note you will take a
[10:43] part of that Paschal meal without prayer
[10:50] in the presence of the great of mighty
[10:54] Elohim Joe
[10:56] our God it is their tradition to say
[11:00] grace before meals and as a result
[11:06] Christians also have adopted the same
[11:10] measure that whenever we are about to
[11:14] eat within our homes we use the term
[11:17] grace before meals now we cannot receive
[11:23] Jesus as our Savior without giving
[11:26] thanks to God for him we must thank God
[11:30] that he gave him to us this blessed
[11:34] Savior this bread of life for man cannot
[11:39] live by natural bread alone but he must
[11:44] live by the Word of God which was freely
[11:49] given to us by our God and our Father
[11:53] let us be having a grateful heart today
[11:57] let us not sorrow that he died upon the
[12:01] cross but let us give thanks that God
[12:04] gave him to us to die for our sins and
[12:08] to be our substitutionary sacrifice we
[12:13] know that God sent him so that we may
[12:18] come to know that we have eternal life
[12:22] and we have forgiveness through him it
[12:27] is only because of God's love and mercy
[12:29] and grace that we are given this
[12:33] wonderful gift of eternal life through
[12:37] election before the foundation of the
[12:41] world and is only it's only proper that
[12:45] we continually give thanks to God and
[12:48] thank him for his wonderful grace on
[12:52] pardon
[12:54] to us now the word spoken in our times
[13:00] by Jewish customs are these blessed be
[13:05] Thou O God King of the universe who
[13:07] brings forth bread out
[13:11] the earth for us we bless and thank God
[13:17] who in his love has provided that
[13:20] wonderful food for us now in the book of
[13:24] Revelation John said I heard a voice
[13:31] like the thundering of many waters
[13:34] saying blessings and glory and honor and
[13:39] power be unto thee O God who who was and
[13:46] is and is to come and the twenty-four
[13:49] elders cast down their crowns before God
[13:54] amen
[13:55] they said amen amen which means so let
[14:00] it be O Lord let us also say Amen so be
[14:05] it Lord this is an honor and glory and
[14:09] power beyond today now after the
[14:13] blessing Jesus broke the bread bread in
[14:18] the days of the Lord Jesus was not ah a
[14:22] loaf as we know it they made what is
[14:26] called select flatbread it was it was
[14:33] crispy and flat and they had to break it
[14:38] and eat it it was not a loaf that we can
[14:42] take a beautiful bread knife and slice
[14:45] it into beautiful slices but it was
[14:50] rough hewn bread baked no doubt in
[14:56] certain ovens and it had to be broken by
[15:01] hand and eaten and it was a bit crunchy
[15:05] sin and brittle and was easier to break
[15:10] than to cut now the breaking of the
[15:14] bread by the Lord Jesus in the first
[15:16] communion is significant to us as
[15:20] believers that we must recognize that he
[15:24] was
[15:24] that he was bruised and that he was
[15:28] broken and died on the cross for us it
[15:32] is written in Isaiah chapter 53 verses 4
[15:36] to 6 surely he has borne our griefs and
[15:41] carried our sorrows yet we did esteem
[15:45] him stricken and smitten of God and
[15:49] afflicted but he was wounded for our
[15:54] transgressions he was bruised for our
[15:57] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[16:00] was upon him and by His stripes we are
[16:05] healed all we like sheep have gone
[16:09] astray we have turned every one in his
[16:13] own way and the Lord has laid on him the
[16:17] iniquity of us all that is the
[16:21] description of God's Living bread that
[16:25] was broken for you that is the
[16:29] description of that bread and we must
[16:32] recognize in our day that Jesus was
[16:35] broken for us that he suffered on that
[16:39] rugged cross and it was for us only then
[16:44] are we able to receive him within our
[16:48] hearts surely we want to thank God that
[16:52] in our day God has broken open the word
[16:56] to us for us to understand and receive
[17:01] him within our hearts the seven seals of
[17:04] the book of Revelation has been opened
[17:07] us up to us that we may receive that
[17:11] life the inspiration and the revelation
[17:15] from it within our very hearts how
[17:19] thankful we ought to be and receive him
[17:22] within our hearts now notice carefully
[17:25] when Jesus broke the bread for the
[17:29] disciples he gave each gave the bread to
[17:34] each of his disciples and it was
[17:36] necessary for each one of them to pick
[17:39] up their piece of the bread are you
[17:42] following me it is necessary for every
[17:45] believer every disciple to pick up his
[17:49] or her piece of bread for themselves no
[17:54] disciple was asked to pick up a piece
[17:58] for his brother or for his sister but
[18:02] each had to pick their own piece
[18:05] individually each for themselves and so
[18:11] is it with the Word of God
[18:13] each must catch the inspiration the
[18:16] understanding of Revelation for
[18:19] themselves
[18:20] each must brick take up the broken bread
[18:24] which he by grace has chosen to break
[18:29] the bread for us on our behalf
[18:34] broken on the cross nailed to the cross
[18:38] for us and we cannot receive him into
[18:42] our hearts interlace until we recognize
[18:46] that he the revelation was broken for
[18:51] everybody but in particularly broken for
[18:55] you individually to see it to recognize
[19:00] the Word of God to understand it and
[19:02] receive him within your heart we must
[19:06] recognize the opening of the word
[19:10] personally we must recognize that it was
[19:14] done to that we might take him in for
[19:18] salvation is by revelation upon this
[19:23] rock will I build my church and the
[19:26] gates of Hell shall not prevail again
[19:30] against it for flesh and blood has not
[19:33] revealed this unto you but my father in
[19:37] here
[19:37] has revealed this on to you and upon
[19:40] this rock of Revelation amen
[19:44] will I build my church and the gates of
[19:47] Hell will not prevail against it thank
[19:50] God for this realization and awareness
[19:55] of what really happened at Calvary each
[19:59] man
[20:00] each woman each young person each child
[20:05] must understand the significance of that
[20:10] substitutionary sacrifice the male dying
[20:14] for his life
[20:15] God dying for man we must understand the
[20:20] significance and the revelation of what
[20:23] the communion is about it is a personal
[20:26] and individual thing that comes directly
[20:30] to you and it is between you and your
[20:35] Savior who alone died for your sins now
[20:39] we know that no man on earth can
[20:44] pronounce salvation upon you and Here I
[20:48] am today even though I'm an ordained
[20:51] minister of God I cannot import
[20:55] salvation to you
[20:57] I cannot impart let me repeat I cannot
[21:02] impart salvation unto you salvation from
[21:07] sin from him from death and the grave I
[21:12] cannot give salvation to any person only
[21:17] Jesus himself can do that as it is
[21:21] written in the scriptures
[21:22] first Timothy 2:5 but there is one God
[21:26] and one mediator between God and man men
[21:33] Christ Jesus and again it is written
[21:37] neither is there salvation in any other
[21:40] for there is no other name given under
[21:45] heaven whereby we must
[21:49] be saved but the name of Jesus Christ
[21:52] that is why we pray in the name of Jesus
[21:56] Christ that is why baptism should be in
[22:00] the name of Jesus Christ and we do
[22:03] baptized there in the name of Jesus
[22:06] Christ which is scriptural baptism and
[22:09] if you are not baptized that way you'll
[22:12] need to be baptized in the name of Jesus
[22:16] Christ and take on the name of your
[22:18] spiritual husband Jesus Christ our Lord
[22:22] the scripture is written friends clearly
[22:26] there is no other name given under
[22:28] heaven whereby we must be saved but the
[22:32] name of the Lord Jesus Christ if we are
[22:36] to receive God's blessings within our
[22:39] hearts and within our lives each
[22:42] individual must come to Jesus for their
[22:45] own selves find some secret place within
[22:49] your heart and cry out to him tears are
[22:53] a language that God understands where
[22:57] wherever you are wherever you are
[23:00] wherever you're watching or listening or
[23:04] hearing this come to him now he will
[23:07] hear your earnest prayer he will answer
[23:10] the call he will answer you're crying
[23:14] you're crying your call to him touches
[23:18] his heart and God will answer the cry or
[23:23] your hearts cry I cannot give you a
[23:27] relationship with God you must do that
[23:31] for yourself to bring yourself back into
[23:35] relationship with God oh if many of you
[23:39] here this afternoon this wonderful
[23:43] afternoon this evening can do it but in
[23:46] your heart but in your lives asking him
[23:49] for His grace for His mercy and for his
[23:52] pardon now Jesus then said after giving
[23:57] them the bread this is my body
[24:00] now we
[24:02] there were many who teach the doctrine
[24:06] of transubstantiation that when they
[24:10] observe the communion that the bread and
[24:14] the wine literally becomes the body and
[24:19] the blood of Jesus Christ each time they
[24:25] do the communion I want you to know that
[24:28] is religious nonsense and cannot be
[24:32] found anywhere in the Bible now Jesus
[24:37] never intended for his natural body to
[24:42] be it physically nor his piss his blood
[24:47] the chemicals of his blood to be
[24:49] consumed in the literal sense and at the
[24:55] commune First Communion he did not break
[24:58] off parts of his body and give that to
[25:01] his disciples telling them to eat it
[25:03] neither did he neither did he
[25:07] drain his own blood out of his veins
[25:10] into a cup and tell them to drink it and
[25:15] we would be cannibalistic if we were to
[25:19] do that naturally speaking like that at
[25:23] this particular time we observe
[25:28] communion and we only use brand
[25:33] unleavened bread and wine as symbols of
[25:38] what took place and what has happened
[25:43] and what was given to us at Calvary now
[25:48] we know bread is a symbol of his broken
[25:51] body the wine is a symbol of his blood
[25:56] shed for us and the observe this great
[26:01] sacrifice by an act of obedience through
[26:06] these symbolic elements Jesus then take
[26:10] took the cup and he gave thanks tricky
[26:15] all of it
[26:17] this cup of course we know was only
[26:21] representative ah and still is
[26:25] representative of all of his suffering
[26:28] and all of his blood that was poured out
[26:32] for us to free us from our sins I say
[26:38] thank you lord
[26:40] thank you Lord Jesus thank you for your
[26:44] blood that was shed for us thank you
[26:47] that you poured out your soul for us
[26:51] glory be to God thank your father may
[26:55] all have an inert bless your name and
[26:58] give your glory and honor forever and
[27:01] forever world without end amen blessed
[27:06] be the name of the Living God now
[27:09] without the blood are my sins your sins
[27:13] cannot be washed away without the blood
[27:18] we cannot be made cleansed and whiter
[27:21] than snow without the blood of Jesus
[27:25] there is no atonement for our sins and
[27:29] without that precious blood there is no
[27:32] hope for heaven and home thank you Jesus
[27:36] for giving your life's blood for us here
[27:40] today we acknowledge that we are
[27:43] grateful we have take full and we lift
[27:46] our hearts and hands on voices in praise
[27:49] and honor and glory to your name on this
[27:53] which is called Good Friday evening but
[27:58] now let us recognize it wasn't the
[28:02] broken body that brought the salvation
[28:06] it wasn't the strength in pilots Hall
[28:10] that brought us salvation it wasn't even
[28:15] the cross itself that brought us
[28:18] salvation all of these things were very
[28:22] important in the overall picture and in
[28:27] God's plan for
[28:30] got Flynn the Savior bled and died
[28:36] none of these by themselves saves us and
[28:40] can save us and will ever be able to
[28:43] save us but it is the shed blood that
[28:47] saves us for the life the token was in
[28:52] the blood the life amen came out of the
[28:58] blood and is available to us in the form
[29:03] of the Holy Spirit that token of the
[29:07] Living God now let me put this to you my
[29:11] brothers and sisters that if a cross
[29:14] could save us then we could then have
[29:22] someone come and deceive us by causing
[29:27] us to place our attention on the cross
[29:29] itself while ignoring the person who
[29:35] died on the cross so it's not the cross
[29:38] itself that we ought to Prater it's not
[29:42] the cross itself that we ought to look
[29:45] to for salvation this is a trick of
[29:49] Satan for the cross cannot save you
[29:53] whether it's on us it's made of gold or
[29:56] brass or wood or what do you have it in
[30:00] your neck or it's in there it's in the
[30:03] front of the church or on the wall of
[30:05] the church that cross is only a symbol
[30:08] it cannot save you it's not one who died
[30:12] upon the cross for you that Saints it's
[30:15] Jesus that says oh hear the joyful sound
[30:20] here today Jesus saves Jesus Saves
[30:24] tell this this word all around let me
[30:28] have talk around the town
[30:30] get beat among all people over the hills
[30:33] and over the mountains that Jesus Saves
[30:37] Jesus Saves and that he alone can
[30:40] provide you salvation for your sins
[30:44] again what can wash away my sins nothing
[30:49] but the blood of Jesus Oh precious is
[30:53] the flow that makes me white as snow
[30:57] what Oh brothers and sisters nothing but
[31:00] the blood of Jesus
[31:02] nothing can force in atone nothing but
[31:06] the blood of Jesus not of good that I
[31:10] have done nothing but the blood of Jesus
[31:13] Oh precious is the flow that makes me
[31:17] white as snow it is not the cross that
[31:20] saves us present sisters it is not our
[31:23] good works that save us it's not our
[31:26] generous offerings to the church that
[31:29] saves us we cannot find salvation we
[31:34] cannot pay Saint Peter at the door we
[31:38] cannot pay for the forgiveness of sins
[31:42] only Jesus Saints only Jesus can give us
[31:47] salvation only he has the keys to open
[31:51] the death hell and the grave he is the
[31:55] only one who said I all the key of David
[31:59] eyes shut
[32:01] and no man opens and I open and no man
[32:07] can shut it oh praise be to God Jesus
[32:12] Saves jesus says oh the cross cannot
[32:16] save your works cannot save that all
[32:19] your all your wonderful good charitable
[32:24] giving
[32:24] cannot save you it was nothing blood the
[32:28] blood of Jesus the perfect sacrifice
[32:31] that gave his life for us it was the
[32:35] blood of Jesus the Lamb of God not
[32:38] bloody bleeding dear
[32:40] lambdai precious blood shall never lose
[32:43] its power Oh till all the rents of
