[0:58] I will give you pastors according to my
[1:01] heart which shall feed you with
[1:05] knowledge and
[1:07] understanding and then Ephesians
[1:10] 4:11 and he gave some Apostles some
[1:14] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:17] pastors and teachers Hallelujah father
[1:21] we thank you for the reading of your
[1:22] word we pray a blessing upon this few
[1:25] remarks we're about to say and we pray
[1:27] that you will oh God just uh
[1:30] Anchorage in the hearts of the Saints we
[1:33] ask it in Jesus name amen please be
[1:37] seated what an exciting time to be alive
[1:40] now they're having a lot of
[1:43] um I don't want to call it fireworks
[1:47] entertainment
[1:49] Amusement a lot of political upheaval
[1:52] whatever going on right now especially
[1:54] in the United States and around the
[1:57] world Amen and um we find out that uh uh
[2:04] governments everywhere are at a loss
[2:06] they don't know what to do they're
[2:08] absolutely in confusion and don't know
[2:10] what to do um I just thought i' touch on
[2:16] God's
[2:17] government of his church that's why I
[2:21] read the scripture the government shall
[2:23] be upon his
[2:25] shoulders that he would govern his
[2:28] church as you know when the world
[2:30] started in the Book of Genesis that
[2:33] God's uh government was um in the words
[2:37] of brother Aubrey who preached the great
[2:39] message off of this Pulpit uh God's fake
[2:45] civilization that God's government was
[2:48] by governed his people by their faith
[2:50] and by their love they followed him
[2:53] because they loved him because they
[2:56] believed in him and they followed his
[2:59] word that's Adam and Eve that was God's
[3:02] government that was sitting there uh but
[3:05] of course Satan always gets in the U mix
[3:10] or mix and um sub tries to subvert God's
[3:16] government and he sub well you know God
[3:20] said you know uh God said this or God
[3:24] said that in other words think for
[3:25] yourself come on uh you need to think
[3:28] for yourself I mean you're just going to
[3:29] be
[3:30] listening to whatever God tells you and
[3:32] run around uh at his Beckham call
[3:34] instead of listening to God uh listening
[3:37] to your own heart but to follow your
[3:40] heart is to be your heart of man is of
[3:42] deceiving the Bible
[3:44] says and it's full of evil and
[3:46] wickedness so he's got to follow your
[3:49] heart you can't follow your head which
[3:52] is intellect so you can't come under
[3:54] those governments you've got to come
[3:56] under the government of God amen amen
[3:59] praise Lord but you see the first
[4:03] natural government of man of course we
[4:06] know Satan is the architect of
[4:08] government he's the God of this evil age
[4:12] and the Bible tells us in Matthew I
[4:14] think it's four um how that he took
[4:17] Jesus up on the mountain and uh they
[4:21] caus him to look out and and said look
[4:24] all these nations look at all this uh if
[4:27] you Bow Down and Worship me I can give
[4:29] give you it all and the prophet said
[4:32] Jesus didn't dispute his claim that all
[4:35] these governments are under his control
[4:38] and all these rulers are under his
[4:42] inspiration and he can Inspire them to
[4:44] do whatever he wants them to do uh as
[4:48] such so we find out that when we go back
[4:52] to the Book of Genesis the first
[4:54] government that was ever set up was uh
[4:58] was uh
[5:00] nimod Nimrod is the first one that
[5:03] started to organize people into groups
[5:07] and Battalion he first got the idea of
[5:10] creating weapons and bows and arrows and
[5:14] Spears and then to uh put people into
[5:19] groups and put captains over them and so
[5:22] on like that and that way when he went
[5:24] to war he because the other nations
[5:27] didn't know anything about that as yet
[5:29] he he could defeat them easily and you
[5:33] know that he also is the first one to
[5:35] set up a city right set up a city and uh
[5:40] later on you know about the Tower of
[5:43] Babel according to dispensational
[5:47] teaching that would be called uh human
[5:50] government coming into being human
[5:53] government coming into being it's the
[5:55] Genesis of human government and so
[5:58] therefore we we find out the evolution
[6:01] I'm talking about natural government and
[6:05] Supernatural
[6:07] government one is God's government and
[6:10] the other one is man's
[6:12] government right so we see therefore
[6:17] that uh for 6,000 years from that time
[6:21] to now man has been trained to or Satan
[6:26] through the
[6:28] instrumentality of C
[6:30] man has been trying to establish a
[6:34] government better than that of
[6:37] Michaels better than that of God he's
[6:40] always trying to outdo God and to
[6:44] produce something better uh and so uh
[6:48] dumb to realize that he's a creation God
[6:52] is the Creator and how is he ever going
[6:55] to come up with something better than
[6:57] his creator but never less that is the
[7:00] insanity of sin it blinds it binds it
[7:05] grinds and it
[7:06] destroys everything and every person
[7:09] that holds on to it and that's where why
[7:12] the devil will find his end in the Lake
[7:15] of Fire right because he does not
[7:18] recognize or does not want God to take
[7:21] control and for 6,000 years he has had
[7:26] he's been experimenting
[7:29] in trying to develop a better government
[7:32] than God's government that's right and
[7:34] you have heard brother BR I'm not going
[7:36] to fire you with a whole bunch of quotes
[7:39] but I'll just paraphrase where brother
[7:41] gr talks that how these governments have
[7:45] evoluted naziism
[7:48] fascism right he talks about the Holy
[7:51] Spirit teaching him about these uh these
[7:54] uh very
[7:55] isms
[7:57] communism socialism
[8:00] right
[8:02] capitalism it's all here they've been
[8:06] experimenting with all that the
[8:08] experiment with what the experiment with
[8:11] uh
[8:12] dictators they experiment with having a
[8:17] council running countries and now the
[8:20] world is caught up with um
[8:24] democracy right democracy not my word
[8:28] but the prophet every single one of them
[8:31] will
[8:32] fail because that is man form of
[8:36] government that he is shaping because uh
[8:39] Satan is trying to do that to produce uh
[8:43] a better form of government than God
[8:45] that's right and of course we take it to
[8:47] another level and we understand that's
[8:49] the reason why he's going to have one
[8:51] world government right that's what he's
[8:54] working to with his various experiments
[8:57] of these different forms of government
[9:00] is to bring it to a Apex or bring it to
[9:03] a
[9:03] conclusion um where he has the what he
[9:08] thinks is the perfect government with an
[9:11] amalgamation of all these uh various
[9:14] forms that he's been experimenting with
[9:17] through these 6,000 years now that's
[9:21] what he's
[9:22] doing but we know that God's government
[9:26] of his
[9:28] people is is uh all his governments are
[9:31] going to fail but God's word in the
[9:34] Bible says clearly that after they all
[9:38] fail Jesus will come right amen and this
[9:42] is what Isaiah is speaking about of his
[9:46] government there shall be no end which
[9:49] is the say all the other forms of
[9:52] governments will End Amen everyone is
[9:56] going to come for Absolute Total end but
[9:59] God's form and structure of government
[10:03] will never
[10:06] end and God's government is by Jesus
[10:10] Christ amen and Jesus Christ is the
[10:13] revealed word amen so while we are in
[10:16] this form physical body in a natural
[10:20] world God chooses to govern his church
[10:24] by his revealed word amen that's right
[10:27] we follow him and we are governed by his
[10:31] the tenants of our faith or
[10:34] Revelation what is revealed to you in
[10:37] other words you can't act upon something
[10:39] that's not been revealed to you right
[10:42] you can't live higher than your
[10:44] Revelation that you personally have
[10:46] receiv that's right amen see it's what
[10:50] you reveal to you is what you react to
[10:53] right it's what you live byen some have
[10:56] little fit others have more fit others
[10:58] have more fit have great faith Jesus
[11:00] said it all that's the way it is that's
[11:03] how God governs his life by how much
[11:06] control he has over you through the
[11:10] revealing of his word to your heart amen
[11:14] that's right and then you obey that word
[11:17] yes Lord according to your faith amen
[11:21] according to my faith like you told the
[11:23] man not according to my faith but
[11:25] according to your faith so be it unto
[11:28] you praise the Lord
[11:29] so we understand therefore that God now
[11:33] has his former
[11:35] government and uh to govern his church
[11:38] me reading the scripture there God s in
[11:41] the church he pastors he said Pastors in
[11:45] the church now the one that the word
[11:48] pastor means Shepherd or on the shepherd
[11:51] Jesus tells the parable of a certain man
[11:53] who had great flocks and hers and what
[11:55] did he do he got uh Shepherds on the
[11:59] Shepherds and sent them out this one
[12:00] with a flock here flock there flock
[12:02] there flock there and of course he was
[12:04] typing God and the government of his
[12:07] church under pastoral
[12:11] Ministry and that he would govern the
[12:15] church through the
[12:18] instrumentality of pastors that he sent
[12:22] in the church
[12:24] Hallelujah wonderful I will give you
[12:27] pastors
[12:29] according to my heart amen is that right
[12:32] amen am I really read that right I will
[12:36] give you pastors after they have become
[12:39] qualified from Springfield Missouri or
[12:43] from Moody Bible
[12:44] Institute or from Northwest B
[12:50] college is that right is that how
[12:54] it and then after they have been a Je we
[13:01] orain we will set them into a parish or
[13:05] an area or a region where we believe
[13:09] they can be a blessing to the people no
[13:12] God said I will give you pastors
[13:14] according to my own heart amen
[13:17] hallelujah and the Bible for says God
[13:19] set in church amen that's right he will
[13:22] set them in the church right amen you
[13:25] know all the denominations have it the
[13:27] minister the bishop the pr priest comes
[13:30] and he's only there and then in the
[13:31] middle of that maybe he goes for a year
[13:33] two years and then he said oh where's
[13:36] where's a priest s where's Bishop s oh
[13:39] he's called away to another Parish
[13:41] headquarters tell him which headquarters
[13:43] not the one up there no sir you see but
[13:47] they moved him to another Parish because
[13:49] that's the way the headquarters Works
[13:51] they move him because he's under their
[13:54] Direction but that's the government of
[13:57] man trying to rule God's Church yes Amen
[14:02] in other words the government that was
[14:03] in the world Satan can be trained the
[14:06] church with that and set up a religious
[14:09] system of that same form of government
[14:12] but in a religious way right in the
[14:14] church amen that's why the Bible says
[14:17] that he's so coming after a while he'll
[14:19] end up sitting in the church being
[14:23] worshiped as God Amen when when that uh
[14:28] uh that Spirit of Abomination sits in
[14:30] the Holy Place being worshiped even as
[14:33] God because he's going to creep right in
[14:35] the church and try to take that position
[14:37] in that way but while God is trying to
[14:41] set his men in place God called God
[14:45] train God St amen God calls them first
[14:49] by his Spirit they don't know anything
[14:52] and then he trains them amen praise the
[14:55] Lord
[14:56] hallelujah their school is uh is
[15:00] neology Right lots of prayer un right
[15:05] their school is in the presence of God
[15:07] with the word of God by the burning bush
[15:10] that is their school they learn by
[15:13] experience they learn by the Holy Ghost
[15:16] leading them and guiding them God that
[15:19] is how they learn God called God train
[15:23] God sent amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[15:27] and so pastors of are actually a
[15:32] gift a love gift of God to his
[15:36] church it's like like a man uh giving to
[15:40] his wife a ring or giving to her a
[15:44] diamond or a Jew it's the same thing
[15:48] amen but it's in the form of Not a Human
[15:51] Being like yourself God Like a Stone
[15:54] being set into position set in the
[15:56] church amen pastor set there for his
[16:01] glory and for his honor amen and just
[16:04] like you and I are predestinated vessels
[16:07] to come in a certain age to be used for
[16:10] a certain purpose and in a certain time
[16:13] for his glory he set Pastors in the
[16:17] church that he might have
[16:20] instrumentality to work through
[16:23] within the Church of the Living God Amen
[16:27] Hallelujah man put something there and
[16:31] then telling God that we gave him enough
[16:34] degrees so now you should work through
[16:36] him and recognize him and forget this
[16:39] other one he's just from the backwoods
[16:40] so you know just a wood cutter or some
[16:43] uh storekeeper or something like that no
[16:46] God doesn't work that way amen God works
[16:50] with his own p with his own means and
[16:52] for his own glory amen so God said to
[16:56] the church he said the Pastor in the
[16:59] church that he might use them as
[17:02] instruments for his glory and for his H
[17:05] amen hallelujah let's go back and look
[17:07] in tight now amen how when Israel was in
[17:12] Egypt and Israel came out and you seen
[17:16] it even on the videos the films how they
[17:19] went by the Red Sea and when they were
[17:21] by the Red Sea how Pharaoh tried to
[17:23] destroy them and the pillar of fire came
[17:26] and stood between them and pharaoh and
[17:28] his
[17:29] and later on when they had crossed over
[17:31] the Bible said and he set a pillar of
[17:35] fire to lead them by Night amen and a
[17:38] pillar of cloud to lead them by day
[17:41] praise God hallelujah amen glory to God
[17:44] but you got to watch you have to
[17:46] understand what God's doing brother BR
[17:48] said he says you know that when those
[17:52] the three wise men left their countries
[17:54] not knowing one another each one coming
[17:57] under the influence of of his star do
[18:00] you know how he was born coming in the
[18:02] same direction their paths are going to
[18:04] cross they're going to meet because they
[18:07] headed the same place to see this child
[18:10] or this King that was born he said and
[18:12] while they moved on the earth the stars
[18:15] were moving in the heavens or as the
[18:17] stars move in the heavens they move on
[18:19] the earth amen now we we our lives are
[18:22] not led by horest hope but brother said
[18:25] that was the first Bible that was up in
[18:27] the sky and uh you're influenced uh
[18:30] still by these things but our eyes need
[18:34] to keep on the word and not on
[18:37] horoscopes that right and astrology but
[18:40] we know that there is influence there he
[18:41] said when those stars move up in the
[18:43] heavens these men were moving on the
[18:45] earth and then when the three men met
[18:47] and they came together those three stars
[18:49] up there become one great big star am
[18:52] amen Venus Jupiter and Mars are one one
[18:56] of the other they just come together
[18:58] like that for one big star praise God
[19:01] hallelujah
[19:03] so while the pill of fire was moving in
[19:07] the heavens and the P Cloud moving in
[19:10] the heavens and all the children of
[19:13] Israel are looking at that and saying w
[19:15] we led by the holy spirit all we have to
[19:18] do is to obey the cloud they never
[19:21] realize that he had a representative on
[19:24] the earth so that he who was in the P of
[19:27] fire can come and use that man's voice
[19:30] and use that man to as the instrument
[19:34] that he might speak through them so uh
[19:38] Pharaoh didn't understand that when he
[19:39] said who is your god that I should
[19:42] listen to him or whatever and the voice
[19:44] spoke out of Moses and said I am that I
[19:48] am that was too much for him he couldn't
[19:50] understand that right and that's the
[19:53] same thing happened with Jesus but when
[19:55] Jesus said it list and you being a man
[19:57] makest thyself God
[19:59] you see but it wasn't that he was making
[20:02] himself God in Jesus's case he was God
[20:06] and one man came to brother BR and and
[20:08] said something like that you are are you
[20:11] the Christ are you the Christ or
[20:13] whatever he says you're not too far
[20:15] wrong he didn't he didn't just brush the
[20:17] guy away he said you're not too far
[20:19] wrong amen because Christ means anointed
[20:22] for one anointed to be here for this
[20:26] hour so that the Holy Spirit has a
[20:28] vessel to FL true Amen to minister to
[20:31] you and then uh this is why a lot of
[20:34] people don't understand in a church you
[20:36] don't just jump all
[20:38] around maybe when you didn't have
[20:41] Revelation and understanding your heart
[20:43] and you were still searching for
[20:45] something and you had to go from church
[20:47] to church place to place because it
[20:49] still wasn't satisfied something in you
[20:51] was not satisfied and you were still
[20:54] moving like that right but you know once
[20:57] you met your genuine pastor and that
[21:01] those spirits come together like that
[21:04] spirit with spirit will me and once
[21:07] they've come together like that is
[21:09] separate amen right again listen to how
[21:14] brother person that your pastor your
[21:17] pastor is the husband to the church
[21:20] spiritually speaking Amen in other words
[21:24] it's like a woman that's married to her
[21:26] husband she do oh today I love you
[21:29] tomorrow I don't love you and she just
[21:31] runs off and goes to another man's house
[21:33] and then the next year you know she's
[21:35] gone to her next house I don't like his
[21:38] another no it doesn't work that way it's
[21:40] because some of those people don't know
[21:41] the real spiritual implications of what
[21:45] it is to say this is my church this is
[21:49] my pastor amen denominations are so
[21:52] watered in down that the
[21:54] sobriety the seriousness and the
[21:57] sacredness have B right out of it that's
[22:00] right amen and people just think that oh
[22:03] it's nothing if I just kill off uh
[22:06] Pastor L and walk out if I tell the
[22:09] preacher off and I walk out whatever
[22:12] that's what happen with most of the
[22:13] young people today instead of working
[22:14] things out is that true amen instead of
[22:17] really sitting down and and talk about
[22:20] it or have a mediator and let things be
[22:23] settled the first thing they know is to
[22:26] walk out as if they were General hital
[22:29] that's a old show some of you young
[22:31] might not know that I know what the
[22:32] shows are now but Coronation Street is
[22:35] the last one I think I I heard of that
[22:38] name praise the Lord see so that's what
[22:41] happen right but it's a more serious
[22:44] thing right cuz that Pastor is fitted
[22:49] for you that's right understand that
[22:52] Pastor is fed for you glory to God it's
[22:57] like Paul said he says you may have a
[22:59] lot of people teach trying to teach you
[23:02] but you only have one spiritual father
[23:04] amen hallelujah you can have a whole lot
[23:07] of teachers but you only have one father
[23:10] when you like him or you're not like him
[23:11] still your father that's right and
[23:13] that's the way God said it right well a
[23:16] lot of preachers pass through here a lot
[23:17] of teachers you might hear on the TV the
[23:20] radio whatever like that you only have
[23:22] one spiritual father amen praise the
[23:25] name Hallelujah so uh aot some of them
[23:29] in Moses's group didn't realize that oh
[23:34] they're just looking at God up in the
[23:36] heavens and there are people who talk
[23:38] about the Holy Ghost and just they're
[23:41] going to just follow the Holy Ghost and
[23:43] holy spirit I'll just read my Bible at
[23:46] home and and everything else like that
[23:49] and don't realize the importance of your
[23:52] having a pastoral Ministry brother said
[23:56] you must have a church home amen you
[23:59] must sit under a pastor's Ministry cuz
[24:02] these are ministering Spirits sent down
[24:06] to minister to you who are the ears of
[24:10] Salvation thank you Lord God say it's in
[24:13] his word hallelujah praise God forever
[24:15] more so while the P of fire is moving in
[24:18] the heavens Moses is moving down on the
[24:20] earth is that right and praise God but
[24:24] then you'll find there's always carnal
[24:26] people in the midst as there was in the
[24:28] book of uh Exodus Numbers Deuteronomy
[24:31] the same thing is ret told about three
[24:34] times and I think you'll find it in if
[24:37] you want the chapter Numbers chapter
[24:40] 16 um you'll find it there and then
[24:43] you'll find Jude refers to it again
[24:46] about the gain saying of
[24:48] Kora right but there you find P Kora and
[24:52] usually they leave out the name of
[24:54] another man that was there AB right that
[24:57] was there
[24:59] um and you know they gotten with because
[25:02] Moses was speaking with such
[25:03] Authority that they start to think that
[25:06] Moses was a
[25:08] dictator they start to believe that
[25:10] Moses was some as the one of them said
[25:15] forget which one but he said you come
[25:18] bring us in the willingness to be king
[25:19] over
[25:21] us you want to be king over us or
[25:24] whatever and started to talk like that
[25:26] but that was carnality
[25:29] that was upon him and if you watch the
[25:32] Ten Commandments the other one said come
[25:34] on the way you you're telling us about
[25:37] this Ten Commandments how we going to
[25:39] believe that that come from God when we
[25:40] hear you the one
[25:42] saying You must have take that rock and
[25:45] carve it up there in the mountain the 4
[25:46] days you were up there and bring it down
[25:49] because you want to make yourself King
[25:51] over us and uh Moses said nothing of the
[25:54] kind amen separate yourself from that
[25:57] kind of thing amen hallelujah
[26:00] so when uh those kinds of spirit are in
[26:04] the church it means that they don't
[26:06] still don't have a real clear revelation
[26:10] of the post pastoral office and what it
[26:13] really stands for right uh praise the
[26:16] Lord and why God placed it and that
[26:20] actually it's a
[26:22] essential element of God's system of
[26:27] governing his church
[26:28] amen he governs his church I'm thinking
[26:32] of a where brother said God could have
[26:34] chose the wind he could have chose any
[26:37] animal anything you want but God chose
[26:40] man to be his agent that he speak
[26:43] hallelujah thank you Lord I mean SP
[26:45] through a dumy he can use anything he
[26:47] wants but the principal agent that you
[26:50] will use is
[26:53] man Hallelujah and that's always stumbl
[26:55] this stumbl the Pharisees when God was
[26:58] in Christ and then he came and and he
[27:00] started speaking and you be a man and
[27:03] and and you're kind of hinting that you
[27:05] are God whatever how can you be you're
[27:07] just a man we know where you were born
[27:09] right but that's the looking at the
[27:11] flesh you don't understand the spirit
[27:13] inside he was the Ancient of Days Amen
[27:17] in a child's body amen praise the Lord
[27:20] so here it is we see the same thing
[27:23] happening now amen of many not having a
[27:26] revelation of the office of the pastor
[27:29] but you see he is a part of God's
[27:32] government on the earth amen is that
[27:35] right one of the principal parts I
[27:37] mentioned Apostles prophets evangelists
[27:40] pastors teachers right but the pastor in
[27:43] the local church is the integral part to
[27:48] govern the Church of the Living God
[27:51] hallelujah now we know that just like
[27:53] the
[27:54] Nations have governments did he
[28:00] nomination and I I I'm saying the word
[28:03] deliberately like that sometimes
[28:06] I say demon
[28:09] Nations but
[28:12] denominations right they take a lot of
[28:16] the uh things out of the governments
[28:19] that are in the
[28:20] world and they brought it over right
[28:24] inside of the church that's righten
[28:27] exactly and they rule the
[28:30] church with that kind of a Iron Fist of
[28:36] government right like that and they are
[28:40] the ones that form what we call Church
[28:44] boards right they form Church
[28:47] boards and we have a church board so I'm
[28:51] not just talking while I'm just give you
[28:53] background and everything else so you
[28:55] understand they the first one form
[28:59] Church of
[29:01] boards and the idea of the church board
[29:05] was to be
[29:06] able to
[29:09] manipulate
[29:11] manage and and curb the power and the
[29:16] authority of the pastor within the local
[29:21] church cuz you see one the denomination
[29:23] is made up they might have 10 churches
[29:26] 20 churches 30 some of some have
[29:28] hundreds some have thousands of
[29:30] churches how are they going to control
[29:34] those churches if they don't have a
[29:37] means of firing cutting off punishing
[29:42] penalizing those
[29:44] FS so what they did was set up the
[29:49] church boards in such a way and flip the
[29:52] coin instead of the pastor being the
[29:55] head of the
[29:57] church and ruling the church they
[30:00] elevate the authority of the church
[30:02] board to rule over the pastor and the
[30:06] church so if the pastor doesn't submit
[30:09] to what the church board
[30:11] wants the church board kicks him
[30:14] out and therefore it creates an created
[30:19] an
[30:20] element where these pastors look at them
[30:23] out there I don't care which one you're
[30:24] talking about they're out there they're
[30:27] ministering carrying out their Ministry
[30:29] the moment their Ministry don't please
[30:31] the people and the people start
[30:33] murmuring they're
[30:36] to is that right they're
[30:39] told the next thing you know is the
[30:44] pastors have now to minister the word
[30:48] and look over their
[30:50] shoulder because they they they're
[30:52] constantly worried about what the board
[30:54] is going to do and what headquarters
[30:57] going tell the board to do right and
[31:00] they're always worrying about that
[31:02] that's a fact right um and and that's
[31:05] the way it is but you see that's not
[31:09] God's former government amen is that
[31:12] right uh I I I I heard a message by the
[31:16] great evangelist called AA Allan who had
[31:19] come out and during the time of brother
[31:21] brand he he he never really got into
[31:23] brother br's message but he had a great
[31:25] miracle ministry worldwide uh just like
[31:28] Tor Roberts a lot of them that were
[31:31] inspired by Brother R uh Jack Cole belma
[31:35] Gardner WB Grant many others they had
[31:38] Miracle Ministries of coming from
[31:40] Brother Grand's influence but they never
[31:43] came into the message as such they just
[31:46] preached Pentecost the gospel salvation
[31:49] and did Miracles and healings
[31:51] nevertheless they were great men and he
[31:54] had left the uh the Assembly of and came
[31:58] out actually he said while he's telling
[32:02] this in his sermon how that the church
[32:04] board came to him and they started to
[32:07] tell him that he had to listen to them
[32:09] and do this as they're told as he was
[32:11] told and this and that he said I just
[32:13] let him out the church they're still
[32:16] running it he said it's busted six times
[32:18] and they're still running
[32:20] it he says and they create an atmosphere
[32:23] where they are now living in a prison
[32:24] with stain glass windows
[32:30] he quite a preacher amen praise God but
[32:33] that's not God's plan amen praise the
[32:36] Lord Church board has its place if it
[32:39] recognizes its position amen and knows
[32:43] how is supposed to be an
[32:46] advisory counsel and help to that Pastor
[32:50] to carry out God's program amen amen
[32:54] praise the name of the Lord hallelujah
[32:57] amen yes sir so uh that's where the
[33:01] pastors have ended up and if you don't
[33:03] believe me go out there and talk to some
[33:06] of those pastors out there never mind
[33:08] how big and successful they look like
[33:11] that their churches are not at piece
[33:14] like this little place we have right
[33:16] they got a millions of things they have
[33:19] to be thinking
[33:20] of they always worried you always have
[33:24] to be looking over their shoulder
[33:26] because they don't know when the should
[33:27] is going to drop is that right they
[33:30] don't even know when the headquarters is
[33:32] going to recall the loan that they gave
[33:34] them to build that
[33:37] church or to do this or to do that amen
[33:41] can you imagine I never found a lot of
[33:44] these things out until when the
[33:46] prophet's message came and I was
[33:49] um asked to get out I didn't say I
[33:52] didn't leave the Bible school they asked
[33:54] me to leave but the fact is at about 18
[33:58] 20 years old um because of the Revival
[34:02] in the town where my wife was the
[34:05] British manager there gave up lot of
[34:08] land to build build a c Church the
[34:12] effects on the life of people but then
[34:15] when a message came and they asked me to
[34:17] leave wow they kept the land they kept
[34:22] it all so that is what they do all the
[34:26] denominations that what they do uh why
[34:28] do you think you see a house of project
[34:30] comes up here and all of a sudden they
[34:33] don't have any membership in that area
[34:34] you know but all of a sudden bang
[34:37] there's a brand new
[34:38] church what do you think they're
[34:40] doing they loan the money to a man that
[34:44] has an Evangelistic kind of ministry or
[34:46] a preacher that they has been with them
[34:49] for years that they know they can trust
[34:51] and they will build the church doesn't
[34:54] matter what the church cost if the
[34:55] church cost half a million milon they
[34:58] build a church and the agreement is that
[35:00] he has to pay that church has to pay
[35:03] back the money to the
[35:05] headquarters right so it's easy for them
[35:08] to just run out and put up a building
[35:10] here put up a building here all the
[35:11] denomination Salvation Army this one
[35:13] that one that's how they operate right
[35:16] Baptist this one that they operate
[35:18] Captain Church same thing so and then
[35:20] they repaying the money but here is the
[35:23] thing about it after they have repa that
[35:26] money the church still belongs
[35:28] to the Catholic Church does belong to
[35:30] the local congregation right it's true
[35:33] that pay for it their name is on it's
[35:37] all still there so what happened how can
[35:40] I pay you back your money and you still
[35:43] own the
[35:44] property see but that's the kind of
[35:47] thing that goes on out there but God
[35:51] never set up that former
[35:53] government right never set that former
[35:55] government up that way so so uh that
[35:58] that's not God's way of doing things
[36:02] praise the Lord now we understand here
[36:06] that
[36:07] um um some pastors are just so scared by
[36:13] the church like some men that scared of
[36:15] their
[36:22] wives they just sit in their position
[36:25] and do as they're told
[36:29] please I'm just using types right I'm
[36:33] not saying that there's anybody like
[36:35] that here but I'm using the typ but I've
[36:38] literally seen men that their wife just
[36:41] talk to
[36:42] them
[36:44] literally what real woman wants a
[36:47] husband like that how is he going to
[36:49] protect you
[36:51] or I mean why would you want to
[36:54] literally emasculate your husband to the
[36:58] he can't even protect you then little L
[37:00] he can't protect
[37:02] himself want to do that of course we are
[37:06] to respect our
[37:08] lives with all that is been done us we
[37:12] are to respect us and many times when
[37:14] they say something to us or they tell us
[37:17] something or ask us to do something then
[37:21] we do it but you do it not because
[37:23] you're scared that's right you love you
[37:27] do it because because you love them you
[37:29] do it because it makes sense you do it
[37:32] and sometimes it don't make sense and
[37:33] you still do it but the
[37:41] fact amen praise the
[37:44] Lord God is
[37:46] good Hallelujah but to think of a
[37:51] fastor sitting in a church and I I know
[37:54] what I'm telling you because I've seen
[37:56] it Monday uh the church or the church
[37:59] court tells him you stop doing this you
[38:01] don't do that anymore do that and do
[38:03] this do that he doesn't line up with
[38:05] that he's out of there they just kick
[38:09] him out so
[38:11] fast that's not the former government
[38:13] that God set up within this message am
[38:16] amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[38:19] amen they will tell you what to
[38:24] preach and when to preach
[38:28] at Easter you will bring certain kinds
[38:31] of messages and at this certain time of
[38:34] the year we need these kinds of messages
[38:37] and he has to stay within those
[38:41] B they will even tell him how to manage
[38:46] the church's money the way he sto
[38:53] MH and therefore they always look so as
[38:58] if they are systematic as if they're so
[39:00] disciplined everything looks like in
[39:02] order that's how it looks and it is but
[39:05] it is not because of love for God it's
[39:09] not because of faith and confidence in
[39:12] the minister it's because they set up
[39:15] rules and regulation within the church
[39:18] right and they even will have this one
[39:22] spying and that one SP on the other one
[39:23] SP on the other one so that everything
[39:25] is kept in order that's not the way God
[39:29] does it in his church amen that's not
[39:32] the way it is according to his
[39:35] word uh let me uh you know
[39:40] what let me give you brother BR speaking
[39:43] because some people would say oh that
[39:45] wasn't the voice of God that was just
[39:46] from the S talking so that's okay the
[39:50] kind of man we need
[39:53] today uh we need man
[39:57] that's been to the burning bush that's
[40:00] the kind of man we need today in the
[40:03] government and in the church in times
[40:07] like these for leadership today we need
[40:11] man that's filled with the Holy
[40:14] Ghost amen praise the name of the Lord
[40:18] that's out of the message called why now
[40:21] remember your pastor our brother Neville
[40:25] he is the full head of the
[40:29] church and brother nille has the right
[40:32] to exercise any Authority that the Holy
[40:35] Spirit would anything the Holy Spirit
[40:37] would tell him to
[40:39] say in other
[40:42] words in this church he has the right to
[40:46] do anything God would lead him to do
[40:50] exactly which means he has the right and
[40:54] authority over his Deacon board
[40:58] absolutely and he the pastor can change
[41:02] that Deacon board those
[41:06] trustees the pist or any office within
[41:11] that church that he desires to change
[41:13] amen that's right let by the Holy Spirit
[41:17] to do
[41:18] so and whatever he
[41:21] does I recognize it God recognize it and
[41:26] will
[41:27] the
[41:28] same Hallelujah see people don't even
[41:32] people don't understand
[41:34] Supernatural brother preach a message
[41:36] called angry
[41:37] prophet he said imagine the prophet was
[41:40] angry which was wrong he shouldn't have
[41:43] got angry but he said God still fulfill
[41:46] his word and wipe out those children
[41:48] that were mocking
[41:51] right calling in bald head and all kinds
[41:54] of stuff like that he shouldn't be angry
[41:56] in the first
[41:58] but he says God is obligated to that man
[42:01] because he set him in the office of a
[42:04] prophet that's right amen he's obligated
[42:06] to man whether right or wrong he's
[42:09] obligated to that man and so he
[42:14] says any office he has the right uh to
[42:20] even switch positions with of people and
[42:24] move them around within the church he
[42:27] ask the authority to do
[42:29] that I trust that the church will always
[42:33] be
[42:34] lovely and that those that Authority
[42:37] would never have to be
[42:40] used but God has given them the power to
[42:44] do that amen hallelujah all right I'm
[42:49] not going to finish that quote but I
[42:51] just want to share now these men who try
[42:55] to do right is the man is the men that
[42:58] our natural government tries to tear to
[43:01] pieces that
[43:04] right I want and then he spoke here just
[43:08] like Samuel
[43:10] Moses Moses said it to D and cor said
[43:14] which one of you go secretly Anointed
[43:16] The conv and asking for money or begging
[43:20] for something or try to pull some
[43:23] trip which one of you
[43:27] said the same thing said why would you
[43:30] not listen to what I'm telling
[43:32] you which one of you he said I stole
[43:35] your sheep or took your hers or or do
[43:37] this or do that any one of you said just
[43:40] come now he says
[43:42] nobody you heard brother brand
[43:45] said and I believe I not believe I said
[43:48] the same
[43:50] thing even the whole congregation was
[43:52] here who in here did I borrow money from
[43:55] what do you borrow money or ask you for
[43:58] money or trick you out of money or pull
[44:01] some why would I do that but he says
[44:04] here amen say they try to tear that
[44:10] man into pieces right and then he says I
[44:15] want anyone someone to look me in the
[44:18] eye and tell me if I ever beat anyone
[44:21] out of anything or stole anything from
[44:23] them in my life by the grace of God I am
[44:26] clear
[44:29] M that means no more to them you're
[44:32] saying that than the snap of your
[44:35] finger if they are carnal they'll still
[44:38] believe you are guilty
[44:41] somehow and that you are a dictator in
[44:44] your
[44:45] church and that when you snap your
[44:47] finger your church does what you tell
[44:49] them to
[44:50] do they believe something is wrong with
[44:53] that they don't understand the
[44:55] difference in somebody OB true love and
[44:59] true
[45:01] Revelation and those who obey through
[45:04] fear they don't understand the
[45:07] difference praise the Lord Brother BR
[45:10] says how unjust can a man
[45:13] be think about it they accus me you gave
[45:18] people gifts when the House burn down
[45:21] there's checks where you give widows
[45:23] hundreds of dollars pay the rent done
[45:27] things like
[45:28] that sir he says to brother brand this
[45:31] is the government investigator did you
[45:34] go to your church board and tell
[45:36] them that you are going to do such and
[45:39] such and spend that money
[45:41] there I said no sir he says why didn't
[45:45] you he says because I'm the pastor and
[45:48] the Lord told me to do
[45:51] it the Lord told me in his word to do it
[45:57] and to don't let your right hand
[46:00] know what your left hand is
[46:05] doing oh now you're trying to plead your
[46:08] case in this court by the Bible the
[46:11] Lord but we are judging you by the law
[46:15] listen to brother Bron sir may I ask you
[46:19] which is the highest law man or
[46:24] Gods I'll take God's law
[46:28] and that's how the case ended you know
[46:30] the story he won the case and they ended
[46:32] up having to repay him uh maybe like
[46:35] $100,000 or whatever because um those
[46:39] were like donations that he was made so
[46:41] they had to give it back to him praise
[46:44] the Lord Jesus hallelujah it's 59 I'm
[46:47] going to start this up here praise the
[46:52] Lord now brother Robertson is the
[46:55] chairman of the
[46:57] trustees and brother Collins is the
[47:00] chairman of the deacon
[47:02] board now the trustees ought to have an
[47:07] office of their
[47:09] own and the deacons ought to have an
[47:12] office of their
[47:14] own and if you have a Sunday school
[47:19] superintendent that
[47:21] person has to have an office of his own
[47:25] whether it's his or her
[47:28] amen but the pastor is the head of the
