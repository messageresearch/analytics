[0:00] guess what you
[0:01] are when you stand on the word of God
[0:04] and you receive the Holy Ghost you're
[0:06] the word for your day and if they
[0:08] rejected him back then those same
[0:12] Spirits are going to reject you or
[0:16] they're going to receive you just like
[0:19] when you receive the word of God you
[0:20] couldn't quite understand why it made
[0:22] sense to you why why because you were
[0:27] from eternity you were an act attribute
[0:30] of God that started in the mind of God
[0:33] in the in the presence of God that was
[0:34] an eternal thought and eternal means
[0:38] having no beginning and no end therefore
[0:41] you could not possibly miss the call
[0:44] because Jesus said all that the father
[0:48] in other words when you know people see
[0:50] he's talking to the father no he was in
[0:52] a human vessel but he was God that's why
[0:56] when Philip came to him says Lord show
[0:58] us the father he says Phil
[1:00] have I been with you so long do you not
[1:03] see when you see me you see the father
[1:06] but I'm I'm in a human
[1:08] form the father is the Eternal logos the
[1:12] god of Eternity the the all that filth
[1:15] it all remember the scripture that we
[1:17] read that God might give you the
[1:19] Revelation Ephesians 1 verse1 17 that
[1:22] God might give you the revelation of the
[1:26] knowledge of God and the understanding
[1:29] of who who he was you see how important
[1:31] it is to read the word of God and see
[1:34] what it is that God is speaking to you
[1:35] through the word of God you can miss
[1:37] these little nuggets but it's because
[1:39] you had the M you you were an attribute
[1:42] of God so you have to go back to God you
[1:45] cannot miss it my sheep hear my voice
[1:49] and that's why when you heard this
[1:50] message you were one in a million that's
[1:53] just the way it is you can't help that
[1:56] you can't change
[1:57] that I tell the people I can't
[2:00] something that I'm not this is who I am
[2:03] this is how I see the word of God this
[2:05] is what I believe this is what God is
[2:07] given me in this day I can't I can't
[2:10] deny the word of God Amen why because
[2:13] you came from eternity you're going back
[2:16] and how you going through a
[2:18] Rapture next
[2:21] slide and so we see that there was these
[2:24] seven Church ages it leads up to the
[2:26] seventh Church age in those Church ages
[2:29] there was different
[2:31] anointings right that's why you know the
[2:34] lion anointing right at the beginning
[2:36] they were bold the Christians were bold
[2:38] they received the Holy Ghost they went
[2:40] out there because God says okay time to
[2:43] bring my church home time to goow and
[2:46] call them all back and how was he going
[2:48] to call them all back through an
[2:49] anointing that he was going to place
[2:52] himself in the church and they went into
[2:54] the upper room and he says don't don't
[2:56] worry go there and Terry when I come
[2:59] back a on you in the spirit form you're
[3:02] all going to be anointed you're all
[3:04] going to have the power to go and to
[3:06] speak boldly preach this gospel into all
[3:10] nations baptizing them in the
[3:13] name of the father and of the son and of
[3:17] the Holy Spirit and now if you remember
[3:20] in in in uh back in Matthew when he
[3:23] revealed himself to
[3:25] them he said it's I jesus this is after
[3:29] your resurrect
[3:31] and he said all power has been given
[3:33] unto me in heaven and on earth now if
[3:37] he's got all the power all how can you
[3:40] say the father Son and Holy Ghost when
[3:43] all the power was in in other words he
[3:45] was saying it's
[3:48] me it's
[3:50] me and what was his name Jesus he says
[3:53] now go into all the world Proclaim this
[3:57] Revelation that I've given you baptize
[3:59] in them in the
[4:01] name and he looked at them I could just
[4:03] see him looking at his children and they
[4:05] said yes Lord we know your name because
[4:08] the scripture says there's no other name
[4:10] that man must be saved by the name of
[4:14] Jesus Christ
[4:16] and in the name of the father and of the
[4:20] son and of the holy spirit that was
[4:23] there and place there by Revelation and
[4:27] the carnal Christian out there takes
[4:30] that and says see there's a trinity
[4:32] there no all power was given to
[4:35] him to
[4:37] him and why did
[4:40] Peter on the day of Pentecost who was
[4:43] right there when Christ revealed himself
[4:46] and gave him that gave them the message
[4:50] to go out and preach this gospel
[4:52] baptizing them in the name listen my
[4:55] name is
[4:56] Daddy I am a father I am a son son and I
[5:00] am a human being but my name is Danny
[5:05] okay I have many offices and you have
[5:08] many offices God was Father Son and Holy
[5:13] Ghost but his name is Jesus Christ
[5:16] Jehovah savior the Jehovah of the Old
[5:19] Testament is Jesus of the New Testament
[5:21] hear ye oh Israel the Lord thy God is
[5:24] one Lord It's All Over the scripture you
[5:26] try and you know you try and talk to a
[5:28] trinitarian and they just keep telling
[5:31] you no that's not the way I see it and
[5:35] you have to
[5:36] say I
[5:38] understand because that's just the way
[5:40] they see
[5:41] it but if you've got a revelation then
[5:44] you're going to see what I'm talking
[5:45] about it's it's because it's plain and
[5:48] it's simple and that's why Peter on the
[5:50] day of Pentecost who had just received
[5:53] the commission from Christ goes out and
[5:56] you read it I tell people read it can
[5:58] you read me this right here
[6:00] acts 238 why did Peter on the day of
[6:03] Pentecost baptize
[6:07] 3,000 and read it to me how he did it so
[6:11] you're telling me that Peter rebelled
[6:13] against God when he said I bapti he said
[6:16] repent every one of you and be baptized
[6:19] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ why
[6:21] didn't he say in the name of the father
[6:23] and of the son and of the Holy why amen
[6:26] because he had a revelation that there
[6:29] was only one name that man must be saved
[6:32] by and those that receive the truth and
[6:35] have the Holy Ghost cannot go against
[6:38] this word you just can't do it you can't
[6:41] do it you just can't do it there's just
[6:44] no
[6:45] way and so Peter baptized them and every
[6:49] baptism in the New Testament every
[6:51] single one of them 8,000 over 8,000
[6:53] baptisms every one of them in the name
[6:56] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:59] this is important this is Bible study oh
[7:03] praise God he ain't going any
[7:05] further than where you leave Christ
[7:08] where you decide that you're going to
[7:10] disbelieve him and say not for me so
[7:13] when the time comes who is going to be
[7:17] responsible for rejecting the word of
[7:19] God you just got to let them know it's
[7:21] not you and you don't condemn anybody
[7:24] you don't tell them well you're going
[7:26] out because you know because that's not
[7:28] even true you don't know whether they're
[7:30] going to hell or not or anybody's going
[7:32] to hell it's up to God but what you see
[7:36] that's what you live that's what you
[7:37] believe and so there's these anointings
[7:40] that came through all these ages that
[7:42] and the calf age by the time you know we
[7:45] we were into the Third Church age we
[7:47] were into that that anointing of
[7:48] sacrifice and calf is is sacrificial you
[7:52] know and people died in the Dark Ages
[7:54] millions of Christians were slaughtered
[7:56] but they were under an anointing
[7:59] to die and fulfill the word of God for
[8:02] their time and their season and then
[8:04] came the Mad age by the time we came
[8:06] into Luther they were starting to teach
[8:09] the word of God and bring the people
[8:11] back to the word of God where they would
[8:13] by justification in other words your own
[8:16] personal understanding of the word of
[8:18] God because the the Catholic church had
[8:20] basically taken it and locked up the
[8:22] word of God and says hey if you don't do
[8:24] it the way we say you got to pay for
[8:27] this you got to pay for penants you got
[8:29] to pay for indulgences you got to pay
[8:31] for this and
[8:33] that and the people just they just
[8:35] obeyed it because of tradition and they
[8:38] figured oh we got to buy our way into
[8:40] heaven they're still doing it
[8:42] today but it's not the truth it's not
[8:46] the word of
[8:47] God and so man age was based on God now
[8:53] using man to reform and restore the word
[8:56] of God and then
[9:00] comes along the eagle
[9:02] age and God sends a prophet Eagle is one
[9:06] who can
[9:07] see beyond it's it's it's it has the
[9:10] ability to see higher than any other
[9:12] bird or anything else on this Earth that
[9:15] can
[9:17] fly gives the anointing to a William
[9:20] brandham to come and restore the word of
[9:22] God God gives him the Revelation to
[9:25] restore the word of God and give us
[9:27] Rapture in faith for the season then
[9:30] comes the opening of the seals the first
[9:32] the second the
[9:33] third we're winding down here we only
[9:36] got 5 minutes to go so this is takes us
[9:41] and then we come right to where the
[9:43] seventh seal is revealed and it gives us
[9:46] the opening of the word and the portion
[9:49] of the word that we need for our day
[9:52] which is Christ giving you rapturing
[9:55] Faith now in those seals wrapped up in
[9:58] all those seals if you keep going
[10:01] along you know it keeps
[10:04] showing everything that's going to
[10:06] happen from the 3 and a half years of
[10:08] tribulation the battle of armagan the
[10:10] Thousand-Year Millennium it shows the 70
[10:13] weeks of Daniel as a prophecy right now
[10:17] notice that's where we seen her coming
[10:19] back to the millennial Temple over here
[10:22] at the end of the Jewish age the
[10:24] anointed he cometh the mighty conqueror
[10:27] yes sir to set up the millennium coming
[10:29] to the temple Glory theirs he meets that
[10:35] 144,000 and brother Brandon did a
[10:37] teaching on the on the temple right you
[10:39] got to keep moving along here with me uh
[10:43] go
[10:45] next right
[10:47] next in the temple and he showed how it
[10:49] was the the you know the three stages of
[10:52] justification sanctification and then
[10:55] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[10:57] Christ himself now com com and filling
[11:00] you and giving you a revelation of the
[11:02] word let's move on and it will be these
[11:05] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[11:07] literally turn the hearts of the
[11:09] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[11:11] exactly so we needed a prophet amen we
[11:15] needed a restoration of the word there's
[11:18] no possible way that you could have
[11:20] known which was the right Church where
[11:23] God was going to reveal himself next
[11:26] slide and so we get and this is the
[11:30] seven sealed book of redemption the book
[11:32] had to be open where our names would be
[11:35] spoken and revealed through the opening
[11:38] of The Seven Seals because all those
[11:41] whose names were written in the Lamb's
[11:43] Book of Life shall not be deceived this
[11:47] is the age where the greatest level of
[11:49] deception is striking the Earth there's
[11:52] never been more deception right and
[11:55] we're experiencing it right now in plain
[11:57] view where they've got fake news where
[11:59] you just don't know what is truth
[12:01] anymore it is total deception you think
[12:05] this one's got the truth you think this
[12:07] is the right president you think this
[12:10] let me tell you something president
[12:13] Trump okay is a
[12:17] placing of the word in order to fulfill
[12:21] a portion of Prophecy that will lead us
[12:24] into the culmination and bring this
[12:28] Dimension that we're in to a place where
[12:31] it will lead and directly bring this
[12:34] world into
[12:35] tribulation it cannot be stopped you
[12:38] cannot stop the prophecy of God's word
[12:41] in all these timelines that we showed
[12:43] you here okay these things must be
[12:46] fulfilled the book of Redemption on it
[12:49] there but it's to be revealed in the
[12:51] last days according to Revelations 10
[12:54] these scriptures must be fulfilled amen
[12:57] praise God this book which is Christ
[13:00] it's Jesus Christ put together by God
[13:02] it's all Christ if you don't see Jesus
[13:05] Christ in every chapter in every verse
[13:09] and every line of the scripture you need
[13:10] to go back cuz he's all the way through
[13:12] it everywhere
[13:15] amen next
[13:19] slide next
[13:23] slide next
[13:25] slide just keep going
[13:31] we went through all of
[13:33] this go on you know I was going to get
[13:36] into each of the seals and each of the
[13:39] writers and and so forth but you need to
[13:41] go back and read the seven Church ages
[13:44] you need to go back and read the Seven
[13:45] Seals there's nuggets locked up inside
[13:48] there don't ever think oh I read it no
[13:50] go back and read it again go back and
[13:52] listen to it again there's things in
[13:54] there that God is revealing every single
[13:57] day amen and so you can see that the
[14:00] whole timeline now when you look at it
[14:02] in a
[14:03] complete cycle that leads us from the
[14:07] you know the the 2,000 years that Christ
[14:09] came on the Earth leading right up we
[14:11] are right now in that
[14:16] rapturing
[14:18] state once we leave here then things
[14:21] move on into the 3 and A2 years of
[14:23] tribulation we're in three and A2 years
[14:26] of honeymoon we go to the
[14:29] big wedding
[14:31] supper okay and then the battle of
[14:34] Armageddon takes place and then we enter
[14:38] into the millennial Reign Satan gets
[14:40] bound up and we come back with Christ we
[14:44] actually bind up Satan with Christ we
[14:47] come back to the Earth and we have theop
[14:49] bodies they're Eternal bodies they're
[14:52] bodies that will operate in this
[14:54] Dimension and in that other dimension
[14:57] because you're going to be you're going
[14:59] to be a super beam I love watching
[15:03] Superman cuz I'm going to do that one
[15:09] day just
[15:11] huah call me crazy whatever but I'm
[15:14] going to do
[15:15] that thousand- year Millennium Battle of
[15:18] Gog and MOG the white Throne judgment
[15:21] and then eternity you want to know about
[15:23] eternity and you want to know about what
[15:24] takes place there go back and listen to
[15:27] the Future home
[15:29] it's a glorious message praise God next
[15:34] slide and so it'll be like it was in the
[15:37] beginning a great Paradise of God that's
[15:41] what we're headed to Saints next slide
[15:44] and we can everyone set under our own
[15:47] let the piano player come up
[15:50] musicians and we can everyone set under
[15:53] our own fig
[15:55] tree and laugh and rejoice and live
[15:57] forever in his presence when he comes
[15:59] back as
[16:01] king and the wolf and the lamb shall
[16:03] feed together and the lion shall eat
[16:05] straw like the bulock they shall not
[16:07] hurt nor destroy in all my holy
[16:10] mountains sayeth the
[16:12] Lord in this glorious rain with Jesus of
[16:15] a thousand years of Peace the birds are
[16:18] waiting for that the trees are waiting
[16:20] for that all nature is bending and
[16:23] weeping and waiting for that time Amen
[16:26] brother Brown speaks here beyond the
[16:28] curtain of time friends you you just
[16:30] can't afford to miss that you just don't
[16:33] want to do it and I've seen the people
[16:35] the ones that's gone on I seen them
[16:37] there the old was young and they were
[16:40] standing there human beings just like I
[16:42] am only without sin it was beyond
[16:44] Perfection Sublime you just couldn't
[16:48] mention what it was whatever you do
[16:51] don't miss it don't miss it don't miss
[16:53] it you can't afford to miss it let
[16:55] everything else go but make ready for
[16:58] that
[16:59] whatever you do now according to the
[17:01] word of God the bride was chosen when
[17:04] before the foundations of the world this
[17:06] choosing of the bride was purposed in
[17:09] himself Ephesians 1:9 and in Romans 9:11
[17:13] it says that the purpose of God
[17:15] according to election might stand you
[17:17] can't read it any other way the heart
[17:20] purpose the Eternal purpose of God was
[17:23] to take a people a bride of his own
[17:26] choosing and that purpose was in himself
[17:29] and being Eternal was decreed when
[17:33] before the foundations of the world and
[17:36] so we see this timeline that leads us
[17:39] into
[17:40] eternity in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 it says
[17:44] and so shall we ever
[17:47] be with the
[17:49] Lord are you looking forward to
[17:53] it get a little glimpse of it
[17:57] tonight you know I know we move through
[17:59] a lot of stuff real quick but I think
[18:02] it's important for us to be reminded
[18:05] through these studies what God has
[18:09] done what God is doing and what he will
[18:13] do and this way we know where we stand
[18:16] we know the hour that we're living in so
[18:19] share these things let them be tools of
[18:24] of uh you know testifying to people and
[18:27] letting them know you need to know what
[18:29] God is really doing in our day because
[18:32] that's where there's faith that goes
[18:35] beyond the faith that a lot of people
[18:38] talk about God bless you
[18:40] Saints I trust
[18:43] that you'll be
[18:46] blessed and that you'll go on and be a
[18:48] blessing and that you'll be encouraged
[18:50] through this teaching to share it with
[18:53] other people go back and read it go back
[18:55] and study it look through the seven
[18:57] Church ages read those Seven Seals God
