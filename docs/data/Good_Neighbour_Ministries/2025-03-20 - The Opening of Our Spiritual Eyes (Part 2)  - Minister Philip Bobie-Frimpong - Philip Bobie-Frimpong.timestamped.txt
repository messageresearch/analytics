[7:29] amen are you love him tonight amen it's
[7:32] such a great thing to be back in the
[7:34] house of God went to to Portugal my
[7:38] family and it's a wonderful time you
[7:41] know sometime you plan something but you
[7:43] don't know God is kind of planning
[7:44] things in his own and doing things
[7:46] behind the scenes and you just sit back
[7:48] and you just marvel at his grace and his
[7:50] mercy so just a little little testimony
[7:53] it's you know was my wife's 50th
[7:55] birthday
[7:56] and it's only after the Lord has showed
[7:58] me 50 minut means Jubilee but we had
[8:01] gone to Lisbon and to she booked these
[8:05] walking TS and they started taking us to
[8:08] these places 12th century churches and
[8:11] they start talking about the the history
[8:13] of the church and you know the the
[8:16] murders was committed by the by by the
[8:19] church and it was stuff that I I
[8:21] couldn't ex I I couldn't even tell her
[8:23] these things she was hearing from
[8:24] somebody else so it was a eye opener for
[8:27] her to see these things and I I'm just
[8:29] marveled at his grace and his Mercy she
[8:32] came back and she didn't say nothing but
[8:33] you could tell that she was shaken up
[8:36] because she would come here sometimes
[8:37] and listen to the word and the Holy
[8:39] Spirit would speak a certain way and it
[8:41] would be like oh you you guys hate the
[8:43] Catholics but they hear it from a voice
[8:46] somebody who was a historian speaking
[8:48] and saying these things showing us the
[8:50] places that there's one guy he they were
[8:53] he was being converted from Jew to
[8:57] Christian to Catholic and and the Muslim
[8:59] them and they was in the church that day
[9:00] and apparently they had a light coming
[9:02] on and the priest said look look there's
[9:04] Jesus coming through the light and he
[9:05] says no no no that's a staining glass
[9:07] they all jumped on him and they killed
[9:09] him that day right in the church where
[9:11] we were and it was for my kids they were
[9:14] like Blown Away by the history of this
[9:17] thing and I said Lord I didn't even know
[9:19] I was what what I was doing but God was
[9:21] making a way for her to see something so
[9:24] we certainly thank God for his grace and
[9:26] his Mercy the age of Grace amen and it's

[20:03] 17913 um
[20:14] okay okay if you got say
[20:19] Amen okay so Luke
[20:26] 24:3 in my Bible
[20:32] okay I can read it from there and behold
[20:35] two of them went that that same day to a
[20:40] village called
[20:43] Emos which was from Jerusalem about
[20:45] three score
[20:47] Falls and they talked together of all
[20:50] these things which had happened and it
[20:53] came to pass that while they communed
[20:55] together and reisen and reason J himself
[21:01] Drew near and went with them but the
[21:05] eyes were holding that they should not
[21:07] know
[21:08] him but there and he said unto them what
[21:11] manner of communications are these that
[21:13] ye have one to another as he walk and as
[21:18] s and one of them whose name was copas
[21:21] answering said unto him are thou only a
[21:24] stranger in Jerusalem and Hast not known
[21:27] the things which are come to pass there
[21:29] in these days and he said unto them what
[21:32] things and they said unto him concerning
[21:35] Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet
[21:38] Mighty indeed and went before God and
[21:40] all the prophets and how the chief
[21:43] priest and all our rulers delivered him
[21:46] to be condemned to death and have
[21:48] crucified him but we trusted that it had
[21:51] been he which should have redeemed
[21:53] Israel and beside all this today is the
[21:57] third day since these things were done
[22:01] yeah and certain women also of our
[22:03] company made us astonished which were
[22:06] early at the
[22:08] serle and when they found not his body
[22:10] they came saying they had also seen a
[22:13] vision of angels which said that he was
[22:17] alive and certain of them which were
[22:19] with us went to the saer and found it
[22:21] even so as the woman had said but him
[22:25] they saw
[22:26] not then he said unto them oh
[22:29] fools and slow of heart to believe all
[22:32] that the prophet have spoken ought not
[22:35] Christ to have suffered this things and
[22:37] enter into his glory and beginning at
[22:40] Moses and all the prophets he expanded
[22:43] unto them all the scriptures the things
[22:45] concerning
[22:47] himself and they drew near onto the
[22:50] village which they went and made as
[22:52] though he would have gone further but
[22:56] they constrained him saying abide with
[22:58] this for it is toward evening and the
[23:01] day is far spent and he went into ter
[23:04] with them and it came to pass as he sat
[23:06] at meet with them he took bread and
[23:09] blessed it and break it and gave to them
[23:13] and their eyes were
[23:15] open and they knew
[23:18] him and he vanished out of their
[23:21] sight and they said unto one another did
[23:24] not our heart bur within us while he
[23:27] stuck with this by the way and while he
[23:30] open to us the scriptures um
[23:35] Matthew
[23:36] [Music]
[23:38] 17 Matthew 17
[23:50] 19-13 then came the disciples to Jesus
[23:53] apart and said why could not we cast him
[23:56] out
[23:59] verse
[24:01] 9-13 Matthew 17:
[24:04] 9-13 and as they came down from the
[24:06] mountain Jesus charged them saying th
[24:09] the vision to no man until the son of
[24:12] man be raisen again from the
[24:15] dead and the disciples asked him saying
[24:18] why then say the scribes that elas must
[24:21] first come and Jesus answered and said
[24:23] unto them elas truly shall first come
[24:26] and restore all things
[24:29] but I said unto that elas is SC already
[24:32] and they knew him not but they have done
[24:34] unto him whatsoever they listed likewise
[24:37] shall also the son of manine suffered of
[24:40] them then the disciples understood that
[24:42] he spoke unto them of John the Baptist
[24:45] let's pray Heavenly Father may you
[24:47] please bless the reading of their word
[24:50] in Jesus name amen yeah please be seated
[24:52] sorry for keeping you so long um so if
[24:56] I'll title this I'll said the opening of
[24:59] our spiritual Eyes Part
[25:02] Two we talk about it about a month ago
[25:06] how like a
[25:08] hazy his natural eyes were
[25:12] open
[25:14] but when the serans came to encamp
[25:18] around
[25:20] them he told Elijah that the people
[25:26] among us are so huge
[25:29] they are coming to beat us they are more
[25:32] and Elijah said that Elisha said that
[25:35] they that are with us are more than they
[25:37] that are coming to encamp around this
[25:40] and he said God open the young man eyes
[25:45] naturally GES eyes was open but he
[25:50] couldn't his spiritual because his
[25:52] spiritual eyes were blind at that time
[25:56] he could not see that the angels were
[25:58] encamp around them so they that were
[26:01] with them were more than they that were
[26:03] against them so Elisha asked God to open
[26:06] his eyes and when his spiritual eyes
[26:09] open then he saw what Elisha was saying
[26:13] so we talk about unless your spiritual
[26:15] eyes is open you can see things with
[26:17] naked but you won't understand it
[26:19] because it takes God to open your eyes
[26:21] of understanding and we talk about God
[26:23] has opened our eyes of understanding in
[26:26] this age and we are blessed because to
[26:29] to us it is given to know the mysteries
[26:32] of the Kingdom but to other it's not
[26:34] given but for you it is given so we are
[26:38] blessed by our heart of understanding
[26:42] that God has opened up at life we talk
[26:44] about Samson and so many of them when he
[26:47] um even though when he was naturally
[26:50] blind at that time when his spiritual
[26:53] eyes got open he was able to defeat
[26:57] achieve more with that natural spiritual
[27:00] eyes open inside than when he was
[27:04] physically could see things so Jesus
[27:07] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[27:10] forever he's never changed so God is
[27:14] still Open the Eyes of his children and
[27:17] blinding the eyes of those who are not
[27:20] supposed to see but you have to be happy
[27:23] and be thankful to God that your eyes of
[27:27] understanding he has has opened up at
[27:29] last amen so that's all it's about that
[27:31] he has opened our spiritual
[27:34] understanding so um that's a little bit
[27:36] recap but today we're going to go back
[27:39] to another blinding of the eyes of the
[27:43] Believers of the
[27:45] disciples these two people walk with the
[27:48] Lord they eat with him they did
[27:49] everything but still when he rose from
[27:54] dead he resurrected they could not see
[27:56] him but one thing that was good about
[27:59] them is that they were talking about him
[28:02] on their way to M they were disappointed
[28:05] they left home and everything but their
[28:08] conversation was about the Lord Jesus
[28:10] Christ and as we talk about him he drew
[28:13] nearer onto them so the question is what
[28:17] are you talking about what are you
[28:19] thinking about what are your focus
[28:21] because the enemy is canning now we have
[28:25] so much
[28:26] information and and even in this age
[28:30] especially recent that Trump came myself
[28:34] I'm become a culprate because like you
[28:38] open the news then you going to get from
[28:41] tari to H Iran to Jews to this and the
[28:46] all the information by the time if you
[28:48] don't wake up you'll be drawn into it
[28:51] and spend so much hours listening to
[28:54] news listening to that listening to that
[28:56] and then social media spiritual days
[28:59] that so many encap so much information
[29:03] I'm not saying that we don't need them
[29:05] as a bride of Christ we listen to the
[29:08] news to find what God what is happening
[29:10] in our time to apply to our life but
[29:13] there has to be a
[29:15] balance we have to balance it so that it
[29:18] doesn't consume all our time because
[29:21] it's a time that is no time to waste it
[29:25] says that even getting so hard that
[29:27] those who have children should even
[29:30] behave like they don't have children you
[29:32] have to pray earnestly as the time
[29:34] approaches because this is the time that
[29:36] is a wicked age it's a wicked hour and
[29:40] that Lous Spirit oh
[29:42] sorry that Lous spirit is around us it
[29:48] can make you look
[29:49] warm and if you don't take time it will
[29:53] just overcome you because that the
[29:54] spirit of the age but we have to shake
[29:57] ourself up and be in the presence of God
[30:00] because that's all that that's where we
[30:03] our strength is when we listen to The
[30:05] Taste when we pray when you read the
[30:07] Bible when you do our part that's where
[30:10] our strength is because the news
[30:12] sometimes if you listen to it to my you
[30:14] become depressed as our pastor was
[30:16] saying that you going to be people going
[30:17] to be scared oh is U Trump coming to
[30:21] invade aness Canada um this thing is
[30:24] going up this thing is going up and then
[30:27] you're going to be scared my mortgage
[30:29] this that it all going to bring too much
[30:31] depression on you but I'm not saying
[30:33] don't listen to it but you have to
[30:35] balance it and as a brother just sing
[30:37] the song that he is our provider he is
[30:40] our strength he is our everything the
[30:43] people in the world have no one to go to
[30:46] but we are blessed but we can go to the
[30:49] our maker you can go to God who provide
[30:52] all our needs so in the midst of all the
[30:55] chaos in the midst of all the
[30:57] tribulation in the midst of all the
[30:59] things going on our anchor hold in
[31:02] Christ and he promised that he will
[31:05] supply all our needs his everpresent
[31:07] help in times of trouble when Trouble
[31:11] Comes God will be there for us we have
[31:14] to rest assured on his word that the
[31:17] Bible said that a th000 will fall on
[31:19] your right hand 10,000 on your left hand
[31:22] but will not come near you only with
[31:23] your eyes will you see the end of the
[31:25] wicked and he promised he will preserve
[31:28] our going out and our coming in angels
[31:31] of God encamp around us so we should
[31:34] focus more on the word of God the
[31:36] Revelation part of the word we should
[31:38] feed on that and stay in his presence
[31:42] and be anchored in Christ more than
[31:46] putting all our attention on the things
[31:49] of the world of the things that is going
[31:52] on that is not our priority it's good to
[31:55] know all those things but what will it
[31:58] do to you if you are not able to apply
[32:03] it in the scriptures to know what God is
[32:06] doing present tense amen that's how we
[32:10] listen to the news for to recognize what
[32:13] God is doing in our time not in the past
[32:18] tense because a lot of people praise God
[32:21] for what he's going he has done in the
[32:23] past they praise him for what is going
[32:25] to happen in the future but fail to
[32:28] recognize what he's doing present tense
[32:31] now he's a present tense God so you
[32:36] should be able to identify yourself with
[32:39] the scripture for your day for what is
[32:42] going on even as you listen to the news
[32:44] but you don't Focus too much on the news
[32:47] because it will going to drawn you into
[32:49] it there has to be a balance there has
[32:52] to be a balance on the hour spent on the
[32:56] social media and all those things I
[32:58] always said that those internet the
[33:00] computer is there for you to use it but
[33:05] if you do not wake up it's going to use
[33:09] you you become slave to it instead of
[33:13] you using it it's going to use you so it
[33:16] has there has to be a
[33:19] balance so in everything that brother J
[33:23] Smith always said he always bring his
[33:24] even his um his level and put there
[33:28] there has to be a balance if you not
[33:30] balance things you are going to be way
[33:32] off to either side or the other side but
[33:36] what am I saying as we Sons and
[33:40] Daughters of God as we listening to the
[33:43] tips as we praying as we reading our
[33:47] Bible we are walking with the
[33:49] Lord because the Bible said Enoch walked
[33:52] with God and he was and he was not and
[33:56] because he was walking with God and
[33:58] communion with God every day he went out
[34:01] before the the rain came in the time of
[34:04] Noah so is the bride of Christ as all
[34:07] these things going on as we commun with
[34:10] God as we listen and you pray and get a
[34:13] revelation part of Faith one day before
[34:16] there's any one atomic bomb before there
[34:19] will be any third world war before the
[34:21] whole world will go into chaos will be
[34:24] out of here as Enoch went before the
[34:26] flat so the bride of Christ we are going
[34:29] to live before any tribulation sets in
[34:34] but the way you before you go is a
[34:37] pattern Jesus Christ is the same
[34:39] yesterday today and forever if Enoch
[34:43] walk with God before you can be in the
[34:46] Rapture you also have to walk with God
[34:49] because you cannot even walk without him
[34:51] holding our hand he's the one that is
[34:54] leading us he's the one that is guiding
[34:56] us so we have to be in a place that we
[35:00] are determined to walk with the Lord
[35:03] because no matter what comes our way our
[35:06] life is in the hands of God and he is
[35:08] leading us he is guiding us he's
[35:10] directing our footsteps so one of these
[35:12] days with a twinkle of an ey that true
[35:16] bride of Christ will be caught up to
[35:19] meet the Lord in the air amen either the
[35:22] people like it or not it's going to
[35:25] happen amen because it's the same yes
[35:27] yesterday today and forever amen Enoch
[35:31] walked with God and he was and he was
[35:35] not he didn't displease
[35:37] him
[35:39] and without faith it's impossible to
[35:42] please God and he only pleased God by
[35:45] faith and Enoch did never please God
[35:49] what the Lord said Enoch D it now he was
[35:52] a type remember the AR is a type of the
[35:55] Jews the 140 ,000 that's carried over
[35:59] which is Noah and his bnch but Enoch
[36:02] went home just a little bit before the
[36:05] flight you know that so Enoch just kept
[36:08] walking in the
[36:09] light so one day he felt his feet
[36:12] getting off the ground he just kept
[36:15] walking and he walk on into Glory
[36:18] without dying amen I'm excited that's
[36:22] right God took him away because he was
[36:24] walking in the
[36:26] light with a testimony that he walked in
[36:29] the light of God kept walking let's go
[36:33] on walking shoes Church keep walking in
[36:36] the light beautiful light comes where
[36:39] the DU drops of Mercy are bright shine
[36:41] all around us by day and by night Jesus
[36:46] is the light of the world so let's walk
[36:48] with the Lord amen let's focus on his
[36:51] word let's focus on him more than
[36:54] anything else because the things you
[36:57] think about it forms an atmosphere
[36:59] around you if you allow yourself to be
[37:02] consumed by the things that is going on
[37:06] present tense in the news is going to
[37:08] bring you fierce but if you focus on the
[37:11] word of God it's going to give you Joy
[37:14] it going to give you H peace peace
[37:17] unspeakable no wonder the Bible said
[37:19] that whatsoever things that are of good
[37:21] report whatsoever things that edifies if
[37:24] there are any virtues think on those
[37:28] things your thoughts are very important
[37:31] it speak louder in heaven than your wor
[37:34] than your words so we have to focus and
[37:37] think on the right thought because the
[37:39] more you listen to this it brings you
[37:42] fears because you are who you are by
[37:46] what you feed on you become what you
[37:50] eat there's no doubt about whatever you
[37:54] eat that's what you become of so if you
[37:57] Fe on God's word it becomes part of you
[38:00] and then it build will Iman resistance
[38:04] and all those things that is coming when
[38:06] people are so scared don't know what to
[38:08] do it doesn't bother you just like braah
[38:11] gave us an example of that lady who was
[38:14] traveling in the ship whatever to the US
[38:17] and then the thing was sinking or the
[38:19] plane and everybody was crying the lady
[38:22] said that they the captain asked her why
[38:24] don't you cry why are you not ping
[38:26] panicking like the
[38:28] she said that I'm not worried I have two
[38:30] daughters one in glory if this ship sink
[38:33] or the plane fall I'm going to see the
[38:35] one in the glory if it doesn't stin I'm
[38:38] going back to what to see my daughter in
[38:40] New York so it doesn't it doesn't not
[38:43] bother it doesn't bother him that's the
[38:45] way Believers has to be we have to be
[38:47] hot potato in the hands of the devil we
[38:50] have to be so much of God that the devil
[38:53] that will not know what to do with us
[38:54] because no matter what he brings on our
[38:56] way we are not shaking because something
[39:00] is flesh in our flesh we feel weak we
[39:02] feel H sometimes weak but deep inside
[39:06] our soul there is something El that rise
[39:08] up in every time to what overcome and
[39:12] face that situation that's why the Bible
[39:14] say greater is he that is in you than he
[39:17] that is in the world he that's in you is
[39:19] Christ is greater than anything you
[39:21] going through it's greater than any
[39:24] accusation greater than any troubles
[39:26] it's greater than anything any sickness
[39:29] that the devil will try to bring your
[39:30] way because he said by his stripes we
[39:33] were healed amen he's the same yesterday
[39:37] today and forever whatever he did in the
[39:40] past he's going to do it he's doing it
[39:44] right now that's the god that we are
[39:46] serving amen amen praise God hallelujah
[39:51] amen and if you r that Luke 2416 to2
[39:58] for they were blinded to the Fulfillment
[40:01] of scripture after the word was
[40:04] resurrected those
[40:07] disciples even though the Bible said
[40:12] that the
[40:14] disciples they have some of the the word
[40:18] was revealed to them they have it in
[40:20] part they didn't have it all revealed to
[40:23] them so when he died
[40:29] before the death came as um we read from
[40:34] the
[40:36] Mathew 17:
[40:41] 9-13 Matthew 17 verse
[40:47] 9-13 and as they came from the man the
[40:51] mountain Jesus CH them saying tell the
[40:55] vision to no man until the son of man be
[40:59] raisen again from the
[41:02] dead in other words he told the
[41:06] disciples that he is going to die and
[41:09] rise up again that's right he told them
[41:12] plainly over here and the disciples
[41:15] being the students of the Bible they
[41:17] asked
[41:19] him and disciples asked him why then say
[41:22] the St that Elias must first come
[41:25] because like a lot of people following
[41:28] this word they know the sequence of the
[41:32] word so they asked him that if the son
[41:35] of man be raisen from dead then why that
[41:38] Elijah has not come
[41:41] yet you know but they didn't know that
[41:44] Elijah has already come and gone right
[41:48] and they were still looking for because
[41:50] they know that by the scriptures that if
[41:52] the son of man will die and Rise before
[41:56] that takes place there has to be the
[41:57] first coming of Elijah so the scripture
[42:00] is telling us about the compound meaning
[42:02] of Elijah he said that answer said elas
[42:05] truly shall first come and restore all
[42:09] things we know that John the Baptist do
[42:12] not restore all things so God send us
[42:14] William AR Braham to fulfill Malachi 456
[42:18] and restore all things amen all things
[42:21] were Rest by Malachi for thing so it's a
[42:24] compound two comings of Elijah so when
[42:26] he spoke
[42:28] that and but I say unto you that elas is
[42:32] come already and they knew him not they
[42:35] have done unto him whatsoever they
[42:37] listed likewise shall also the son of
[42:39] man suffer of them so once he said that
[42:43] their eyes open and they realized he was
[42:46] talking about John the Baptist so they
[42:50] knew the sequence of the scriptures that
[42:52] before the son of man died and Rise
[42:55] there has to be Elijah first to the Jews
[42:59] in that day and here they are Jesus
[43:04] Christ truly died and Rose up three days
[43:09] and they were
[43:10] sad one day after that they were sad
[43:13] going back Peter was disappointed going
[43:16] back to his fishion they were all
[43:18] disappointed and down that but he has
[43:22] told them that the scripture said that I
[43:24] will never leave my Holy One to what
[43:27] suffer corruption I I'll not leave his
[43:30] soul in Hell neither will I leave him to
[43:32] suffer corruption it means that he will
[43:34] not leave them to to die more than three
[43:36] days and he said I destroyed this Temple
[43:39] and I rais up in the third day he gave
[43:42] them all those
[43:44] scriptures yet when the thing fulfilled
[43:47] right in their time the day that they
[43:50] were living in they miss it even though
[43:53] Peter God by his grace in might Matthew
[43:57] 16 he asked who the son of man is and he
[44:01] said that thou are the son of the Living
[44:03] God we are not Elijah this he said upon
[44:06] this I'll build my church and the Gate
[44:08] of Hell shall not Prevail against it it
[44:11] was revealed to Peter that he was the
[44:14] son of man and he got they have all
[44:16] those things
[44:19] yet because the fullness of the word was
[44:22] not given at that time they couldn't
[44:25] recognize when the thing happened and
[44:27] they were so sad same thing today the
[44:30] scripture repeat
[44:32] itself they were so
[44:35] sad and he said why are you so sad and
[44:39] they began to tell
[44:40] him about what is happening and he
[44:44] behaved like he doesn't know what was
[44:47] going on and he was listening to them
[44:49] and they were preaching to him amen and
[44:52] then he got to a place he stepping and
[44:56] said
[44:57] you are fools and slow of heart to
[45:02] believe
[45:03] all all that the prophet has
[45:07] spoken about himself he rebuked them for
[45:11] their unbelief for taking part of the
[45:13] word
[45:14] and in when the eyes were open braam
[45:17] went on and explained that he was
[45:20] talking about the part of the word
[45:23] concerning their day the scripture
[45:27] fulfillment of their day because Luther
[45:31] recognized the part of the scripture for
[45:34] his day Wesley recognized the part of
[45:37] the scripture for his day Pentecost
[45:41] restoration of the gift when it came
[45:44] Street they recognize the scripture for
[45:47] their day but remember when that
[45:49] Pentecost came in those times it wasn't
[45:53] a fun to be with they were not accepted
[45:57] it was so bad that even the prophet of
[46:00] God his mother-in-law did not want her
[46:03] daughter to be associated with those
[46:06] people it wasn't accepted they were
[46:10] persecuted they were crucified but the
[46:13] moment they organize and become accepted
[46:16] by the whole world it means that the
[46:18] spirit of God has left from them so he
[46:21] rebuked them for not recognizing the
[46:24] part of the scripture they are
[46:27] fulfilling in that present test of his
[46:33] ministry and is the same yesterday today
[46:37] and forever so if you are a true son or
[46:41] a child of God God expect you to
[46:44] recognize exactly you know what it
[46:47] happened in the Luther time that's good
[46:49] for Luther and his time not what
[46:51] happened in Wesley not what even
[46:53] happened in Pentecost but what part the
[46:55] bride is for filling present test right
[46:59] now that's the only way that will please
[47:02] God hallelujah without you being in it
[47:05] you can say whatever you want it doesn't
[47:07] do nothing that gives you courage that
[47:11] give you confidence to step on the word
[47:13] of God and know that God is with you I
[47:16] believe that's what the prophet of God
[47:18] only you recognize he's the one
[47:20] fulfilling that Mal 45 he gave him
[47:22] confidence he gave him Assurance to Mo
[47:25] on perfect faith to move on the word so
[47:28] it is doing the bride to recognize that
[47:31] he she is a wife of Christ she is
[47:34] invisible Union of Christ being united
[47:36] with the word of God for today and he
[47:39] gives you courage and confidence so
[47:41] you're not scared of anyone just like
[47:43] Peter and the rest they were so scared
[47:46] even they ran away when Jesus Christ
[47:48] when they said that you are one of them
[47:50] Peter ran away but when on the Pentecost
[47:55] those said where is Rabbi Jones because
[47:57] that confidence has he recognized what
[48:00] part of the word he was fulfilling so
[48:02] that you recognize that you cannot
[48:04] please God Amen praise God our God is
[48:07] awesome God he's the same yesterday
[48:10] today and forever amen hallelujah so God
[48:13] is good all the time praise God Amen God
[48:18] is wonderful he's so good he's the same
[48:23] yesterday today and forever amen amen
[48:26] praise God
[48:29] hallelujah
[48:31] amen
[48:33] hallelujah now these disciples should
[48:36] have recognized him they didn't know the
[48:40] scripture here here he then revealed to
[48:43] them notice as he began to go along he
[48:46] revealed to them the scripture promise
[48:48] concerning himself of that age not the
[48:53] scripture
[48:55] promises concerning
[48:57] himself promised in Noah's age not the
[49:00] scripture promis for other ages the
[49:03] scripture promis concern himself for
[49:05] that age that show exactly who he was he
[49:09] be to ask them said why are you so sad
[49:13] why they said are you a stranger here
[49:15] look him right in the face are you a
[49:17] stranger here don't know what happened
[49:19] Jesus of nazare Might approve of God he
[49:22] said what things happen just like he
[49:24] knew nothing about it he just act as as
[49:26] if he didn't know nothing about it but
[49:29] now remember when he begin to
[49:32] speak to reveal them the promise concern
[49:35] himself said don't you know how Christ
[49:37] must first suffer and enter into his
[49:39] glory and then he begin with the
[49:41] scripture from Moses and all the
[49:43] prophets and reveal to them the
[49:45] scriptures pertaining to
[49:47] himself the Messiah what the Messiah was
[49:50] to be what everything if that isn't
[49:53] repeat today he's doing the same and
[49:56] still the Church mops in darkness
[49:59] revealing to them who he is and what he
[50:01] is and so they say well now I believe my
[50:05] church teach there you are you see
[50:08] that's the reason you go back to
[50:10] scriptures set the scripture they've got
[50:13] the truth you get it so Twisted how do
[50:16] you know it the scripture when is the
[50:18] scripture promised for that age amen so
[50:23] it's for the promise for your
[50:27] age not any other age
[50:31] amen and one other
[50:33] thing the
[50:36] disciples even
[50:38] though
[50:41] um Jesus Christ was talking to them on
[50:45] the way to OS he was explaining to them
[50:48] the word for the age thing that was
[50:50] going on but still Their Eyes Were
[50:53] blinded but the woman at the well when
[50:56] exact same thing happened to her even
[50:59] though she was a prostitute married five
[51:03] times about to marry the sixth man
[51:07] taking somebody's wife but when that
[51:10] word was revealed to him he knows the
[51:14] scripture she knows the scripture for
[51:16] the age she knows that we know that when
[51:18] the Messiah cometh he will do these
[51:22] things she cut it right away and R with
[51:26] the script chest so even though her
[51:29] heart her outside look
[51:33] black she looked black outside but there
[51:37] was a light of God deep inside her soul
[51:40] so when that word ignite and she heard
[51:44] that word that light come to what come
[51:46] to pass and that word become so
[51:48] resurrected in her that she caught it
[51:51] right away and ran with the message and
[51:54] said come and see a man who has told me
[51:57] the things of my life isn't he the very
[52:00] Messiah she CAU that attention but the
[52:04] priest looked so Pious on the outside
[52:07] but had black inside the heart so when
[52:10] the same thing was did to the high
[52:12] priest over there they talk against it
[52:16] and they said that you are visel and
[52:19] what they died in their sins for saying
[52:22] that
[52:24] because they were because they were
[52:28] black on the inside and the outside they
[52:31] were deceiving the people because of the
[52:34] law that they were following so when the
[52:36] thing was revealed and he did the same
[52:38] thing they call him of the devil but he
[52:41] said that when the son of man this would
[52:43] will be given to them when it come again
[52:45] in the form of the Holy Ghost one word
[52:47] against it will never even what be
[52:49] forgiven all the world to come so it's
[52:53] not much of the outside it based on the
[52:56] predestinated seed it based on the seed
[52:59] inside if you attribute of God and you
[53:02] are part of God it doesn't matter how
[53:05] you may look bad on the outside before
[53:07] the word comes to you when the word
[53:09] comes to you something new will grab it
[53:12] it will light up come on that Spirit of
[53:15] Christ inside your heart it will come to
[53:17] light amen it's something you you might
[53:20] not even fully understand it no wonder
[53:23] Peter said that where shall we go
[53:26] because the Lord Jesus Christ was trying
[53:29] to what test the people he told them
[53:32] that except you eat of My Flesh and
[53:35] drink of my blood you have no part in me
[53:38] and that time 500 of them they all left
[53:40] it left 72 70 and out of the 70 he told
[53:44] them that even the son of man who is
[53:48] standing here now in
[53:51] heaven and they said what you Joseph s
[53:55] re as a carpenter side
[53:57] how you going to be in heaven and it was
[53:59] so much for them they left and it was
[54:02] left to 12 and he asked them will you
[54:05] also
[54:07] go and Peter didn't even understand it
[54:12] but something in him was a light of God
[54:16] and he said where will we go thou alone
[54:20] has eternal life and they follow that
[54:23] word of God regardless of whatever it
[54:27] was they gave their heart to that word
[54:29] of God Amen even though he tried
[54:32] them but they still something in them
[54:35] will not leave just like Naomi he tried
[54:39] she
[54:40] tried um Ruth and op and make it look so
[54:44] bad and said even now I'm an old lady if
[54:50] I have to go and marry again will you
[54:53] wait till that boy be
[54:57] born and grow and marry
[55:00] him and it was but you know what all the
[55:04] time it was in open heart to go
[55:09] back so when that word was spoken to her
[55:13] she took advantage of that and returned
[55:17] but neomi had purpose in her heart to go
[55:21] or Ruth had purpose in her heart to
[55:23] follow the word to follow Naomi so she
[55:26] said said that your people will be my
[55:28] people where they bury you they I'll
[55:31] bury whatever happen to I follow you to
[55:33] the end she was tried but in her heart
[55:38] she has purpose to follow the word of
[55:41] God so it is
[55:43] today we are going you have been tried
[55:47] back and forth and some of the people
[55:50] that we started the race they are not
[55:54] yet here with us because when the try
[55:56] and those persecution came some of them
[55:59] in their heart they want to go anyways
[56:02] so they use that an excuse to just
[56:05] leave because they were following
[56:08] sometimes by the
[56:09] law and they can't keep up the law again
[56:13] but instead of opening their heart and
[56:15] allow God to come inside and take that
[56:18] burden and live the life through them to
[56:20] become easy they didn't like it that way
[56:22] they want to have power to do it so when
[56:25] the tast when the try came when the Lord
[56:28] tried them a little bit they just ran
[56:31] back but if you check the disciples when
[56:34] they heard the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:36] speaking they become so excited in their
[56:39] heart they wanted to know more about it
[56:42] so when he pretend that he was leaving
[56:46] them the Bible said that they constrain
[56:48] him to not go because they become so
[56:51] excited but the way that we here say
[56:53] don't go don't go follow us and they
[56:55] took them to they took him to the end
[56:58] even though he MaDee pretend that he was
[57:02] leaving them but because that word was
[57:05] so rich in their hearts they wanted to
[57:08] know more sometimes I don't know about
[57:11] when I come to church and the preaching
[57:12] goost and some so it grab my heart like
[57:15] that you don't even see the time you
[57:18] become so consumed with that way the
[57:20] presence of God that I don't want to
[57:22] leave anywhere so they were so excited
[57:24] consumed with the word that they were
[57:27] hearing that they constrain him that
[57:30] abide with
[57:31] this and one other thing when they
[57:36] invited him in into the
[57:40] house he did
[57:43] something he broke the bread a certain
[57:46] way then the eyes got open and they
[57:49] recognized that it was him but before
[57:52] they could recognize that they have to
[57:54] invite him in and so so is you and me
[57:58] yes God is looking into our heart we
[58:01] have to invite him fully in our heart to
[58:05] be our Lord not only our savior to take
[58:08] full control full preeminence in our
[58:11] heart because he knows everything about
[58:13] our heart he knows all our thought the
[58:16] word of God designs our heart and he
[58:19] knows everything about us so we should
[58:22] fully not
[58:24] 99% in invite him in when you are fully
[58:28] inviting in then he take control of your
[58:31] throne he reveal himself to you that's
[58:34] what he's been doing to us we have
[58:36] opened our heart to him so he's fully
[58:38] inside of us reveal himself to us now
[58:41] and then little by little precept upon
[58:43] precept here a little there little all
[58:46] the time that's what he's doing to us
[58:48] but those who has not fully Open the
[58:50] Eyes to them to him they can't
[58:53] understand it they can't catch the
[58:55] revelation because they are basing it on
[58:57] the letter the Bible said the letter
[59:00] kill it but the spirit give life God
[59:02] doesn't care how much you know the
[59:04] written written letter all that he cares
[59:07] about your heart is your heart
[59:09] right not the knowledge the knowledge
[59:12] part is good but God looks beyond the
[59:15] knowledge he looks into our heart so our
[59:20] heart has to be pure he has to be full
[59:22] invitation for him to take full
[59:25] preeminence
[59:27] that's the only thing God wants he
[59:28] doesn't care how much you know the
[59:29] letter the devil doesn't care because
[59:32] when he met the Lord Jesus Christ he
[59:35] knew the letter all the letter the Bible
[59:38] said the Bible said the scripture said
[59:39] the scripture said he said they said
[59:41] said that Al also written Worship the
[59:44] Lord your God and him alone deserve to
[59:46] be worshiped so he know 99% of the word
[59:50] but the devil wasn't the word but the
[59:52] Lord Jesus Christ was the word of God
[59:55] Amen amen so the letter could not what
[59:59] um make um could could not confine him
[1:00:03] because he was the word when the enemy
[1:00:05] tried to twist that scripture to him he
[1:00:08] put him back in his right place so it's
[1:00:11] you and me that word of God is in
[1:00:14] you sometimes you don't even understand
[1:00:17] but something new lights up and you
[1:00:20] could say it's
[1:00:21] wrong how do you know it but something
[1:00:24] in you
[1:00:26] and when the truth is presented to you
[1:00:28] your heart will bear record of it you
[1:00:31] can never be
[1:00:33] deceived because you are part of him
[1:00:36] amen if you could not deceive him there
[1:00:38] he cannot deceive you too amen you are
[1:00:41] son and daughter of the Living God and
[1:00:44] the Lord dwells in your heart he's the
[1:00:47] same yesterday today and
[1:00:50] forever Our God hasn't changed amen
[1:00:54] praise God
[1:00:57] hallelujah amen praise God so what am I
[1:01:02] trying to
[1:01:04] say um the same
[1:01:08] disciples
[1:01:10] when he they invited him him and the
[1:01:14] eyes of understanding were open and
[1:01:16] everything happened
[1:01:19] remember he told them to what carry in
[1:01:22] the Jerusalem until the Holy Ghost comes
[1:01:27] so on the day of
[1:01:29] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fully
[1:01:33] came and
[1:01:35] because they called the revelation of
[1:01:38] the word and they received a genuine
[1:01:42] birth Peter was right
[1:01:45] away able to tell the people that they
[1:01:48] are not what mad or they have not drank
[1:01:50] anything he was able to go back and
[1:01:53] point them to the scripture this is that
[1:01:57] which was spoken of by Joel he was able
[1:02:00] to let them know the actions what is
[1:02:02] taking place in their life at that
[1:02:05] moment was the Fulfillment of the
[1:02:07] scripture so it's you and me when the
[1:02:10] word is fully revealed to you whatever
[1:02:13] God is doing in the present tense
[1:02:16] because he's part of you you will catch
[1:02:19] it am you will know it how I can explain
[1:02:24] it remember Peter John and the rest they
[1:02:28] never met Moses they never met Elijah
[1:02:31] but when they met them in that man
[1:02:33] transg gration they recognize them oh my
[1:02:36] so is you and me amen when that word is
[1:02:40] made flesh that word has been made flesh
[1:02:43] in you and me when the scripture is
[1:02:46] being fulfilled you cannot help but
[1:02:49] catch it Hallelujah you will catch it
[1:02:52] just like that amen the same way Peter
[1:02:55] and and the rest of day of Pentecost
[1:02:57] they could go back and tell them that
[1:03:01] what is happened to them brother on that
[1:03:03] day is what that Bible spoke in Joel
[1:03:07] 2:28 they caught it just like that and
[1:03:11] ever that time it has been the
[1:03:14] pattern from that time
[1:03:17] onwards all those Saints and Daughters
[1:03:20] of God fulfill and recognize the
[1:03:24] scripture for their
[1:03:26] day that's why Luther being part of the
[1:03:31] whole
[1:03:33] thing when he was reading the Bible and
[1:03:37] the judge shall live by faith became so
[1:03:40] real to him he couldn't help himself but
[1:03:44] to stand on that
[1:03:46] scripture amen and brother Abraham when
[1:03:50] that Malachi 45 Revelation 10:7 all
[1:03:53] those scriptures became so real to him
[1:03:56] he couldn't he couldn't do anything but
[1:03:57] stand fully on it even though some
[1:04:00] people said that he was mad he was this
[1:04:02] he that but he's to on it because
[1:04:05] something in him has recognized what
[1:04:08] part that he is fulfilling hallelujah
[1:04:11] amen and it's so sad thank you Lord he's
[1:04:14] gone back to his
[1:04:15] reward but people following this word
[1:04:19] people M but the scripture repeat itself
[1:04:26] some have gone to um some doctrines
[1:04:31] Thunder camp this camp that camp this
[1:04:35] camp that camp but the bride of Christ
[1:04:37] walk in the middle of the a with a
[1:04:39] balanc Ministry recognize the path that
[1:04:43] she is fulfilling they is not looking to
[1:04:45] the left or the right but she's walking
[1:04:49] right in the middle of the H and God
[1:04:51] will reveal him himself to her daily
[1:04:54] daily and then just like Enoch she's
[1:04:57] walking with God in step with the
[1:04:59] revealed word of the hour amen she walks
[1:05:02] in step with the reveal word of the hour
[1:05:05] she's not looking back she's not feeding
[1:05:07] only on the back on the back on the
[1:05:09] History part she's feeding on the
[1:05:11] revealed word what God has revealed in
[1:05:14] the past and what God is doing now the
[1:05:17] part that he's revealing in the present
[1:05:21] tense and it's so clear to her what part
[1:05:25] of the scripture she's
[1:05:27] fulfilling and unlike the Pentecostal
[1:05:31] people they are so
[1:05:34] blinded expecting that the Raptor will
[1:05:37] come with the way they expect they send
[1:05:39] Africa they going to be
[1:05:42] trumpet then they have Clos the way
[1:05:45] demonstrate is been
[1:05:47] funny but the Bible said the Lord
[1:05:50] himself shall desend with with a shout
[1:05:53] that shout the message going on right
[1:05:55] now
[1:05:56] amen and the bride of Christ knows has
[1:05:59] recognized that the Rapture is a process
[1:06:03] leading to an
[1:06:04] event amen and we know we are in the
[1:06:07] process he said that your eyes your
[1:06:09] heart your heart CH didn't it he said
[1:06:12] that your soul this lighted didn't it so
[1:06:15] when that where you first C that
[1:06:17] Revelation that rapture start already
[1:06:19] and you a process going to lead to an
[1:06:22] event that's right and we are in that
[1:06:24] process
[1:06:26] but people are blind as blind can be
[1:06:30] they pointed back to the to the to the
[1:06:34] history they point it back to the future
[1:06:37] and they don't know what he the Lord
[1:06:39] Jesus Christ is doing
[1:06:42] now is the present stage of his ministry
[1:06:47] thank you Lord and the people are
[1:06:49] looking in the
[1:06:52] future but we are walking in step
[1:06:56] with a revealed word of the hour and he
[1:06:59] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:07:04] amen our God is
[1:07:06] Awesome hallelujah praise our God he's
[1:07:11] God that never
[1:07:12] changeed and one other
[1:07:15] thing the bride of
[1:07:18] Christ has
[1:07:20] recognize that is God himself leading us
[1:07:24] back it's not we ourselves we have got
[1:07:28] to that
[1:07:29] place that God is the one doing
[1:07:34] everything all that he want is what a
[1:07:36] surrounded
[1:07:38] heart and then he comes and so with you
[1:07:41] and direct your footsteps and lead you
[1:07:44] to
[1:07:45] himself because remember in the
[1:07:49] Pentecost Pentecostal age was the
[1:07:51] seventh angel but when it come the
[1:07:54] bright age it's the Mighty Angel himself
[1:07:56] as our pastor has been teaching us that
[1:07:58] he left on his throne and came back the
[1:08:02] second coming of Christ reveal all the
[1:08:05] seals so there's nothing left again but
[1:08:08] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:11] remember some people are looking for oh
[1:08:15] just like the disciples they were
[1:08:18] telling the Lord
[1:08:20] oh um if you say that you're going to
[1:08:23] die and rise up again
[1:08:27] then why the scripture said Elijah must
[1:08:30] first come so some people are looking
[1:08:34] forward oh before the Rapture comes this
[1:08:37] will happen that will happen that will
[1:08:40] happen and they looking they putting all
[1:08:43] in future but they forget to realize
[1:08:47] that when the Lord says on the day that
[1:08:49] he died on Calvary so many scriptures
[1:08:53] amen fulfill bum bum bum bum bum bum
[1:08:57] and all of them started like that and
[1:09:00] the sad part of it is that those
[1:09:04] pares who were singing The Psalm 22 my
[1:09:09] Lord my Lord why have you forsaken in
[1:09:11] all those scripture concerning him they
[1:09:14] were singing the Psalms and for doing
[1:09:17] exact same thing to the son of man and
[1:09:20] they didn't even know that they were
[1:09:22] fulfilling that
[1:09:23] part so it is
[1:09:28] today so many people are denying this
[1:09:31] word of
[1:09:33] God they don't know that they are
[1:09:35] fulfilling and it all say somewhere
[1:09:38] there has to be what a falling away
[1:09:42] first and some people have fallen away
[1:09:44] to the left the right and they don't
[1:09:47] know that they are what fulfilling the
[1:09:50] scripture so you are
[1:09:53] blessed that your eyes of
[1:09:56] understanding it has been opened up at
[1:09:58] last thank you and it is you it is given
[1:10:03] to know the mystery of the
[1:10:05] Kingdom for you it is given to them it
[1:10:08] is not
[1:10:09] given so we are privileged people and we
[1:10:13] have to be thankful every day for what
[1:10:16] God has done for us because he has
[1:10:20] revealed to us his Plan of Salvation
[1:10:24] thank you Lord that alone is more than
[1:10:28] anything else the world can give you
[1:10:30] there's nothing that come
[1:10:33] close to what God has done for us as I
[1:10:37] said on the other time if we were to be
[1:10:39] transported
[1:10:40] back the time of Jesus you have you
[1:10:44] shall receive his word one time I went
[1:10:48] to um a man's a man house those I was
[1:10:51] looking for a place to live in lakes sha
[1:10:54] I went to a Pretender place and I Tred
[1:10:57] to build give them my application and I
[1:11:00] happened to have one of the message book
[1:11:03] in my hand I think it was my pocket or
[1:11:05] something I didn't do it
[1:11:08] consciously so the man saw the book he
[1:11:11] said hey where do you have this book do
[1:11:13] you believe in williamon Braham I said
[1:11:15] yes he said me and my brother I'm a
[1:11:19] preacher Pentecostal brother my brother
[1:11:21] believed everything the message that
[1:11:24] believe but me I don't believe it so we
[1:11:28] don't talk about about the
[1:11:30] scriptures and I told him unconscious I
[1:11:34] said unconsciously I said if we were to
[1:11:37] be living in the time of John the
[1:11:39] Baptist will you have recognize the
[1:11:42] message of John the Baptist if you have
[1:11:44] been transported
[1:11:46] back if you could have catched what John
[1:11:48] the Baptist was saying and follow that
[1:11:51] word you would have recognized what God
[1:11:54] is doing now now in William Maron
[1:11:57] braham's Ministry and the man looked
[1:12:00] like me like he didn't say anything
[1:12:03] again why someone like John the Baptist
[1:12:06] he was so sure that the Messiah was on
[1:12:10] Earth in his time he was so
[1:12:14] confident and the Lord revealed it to
[1:12:18] him so it's something that nobody can
[1:12:22] give it to
[1:12:23] you only God can take you to what to
[1:12:28] that Mo only can move you to that top of
[1:12:31] the pyramid nobody can put himself over
[1:12:34] there that thing is left in God's hands
[1:12:37] but if you are part of it
[1:12:40] unconsciously you don't fight it it's
[1:12:44] just
[1:12:45] easy you let go and let God hallelu have
[1:12:49] his own way and all those things fulfill
[1:12:52] in your life because it's not you doing
[1:12:56] it last week I was at the B shop and we
[1:13:01] were just talking and I happened to tell
[1:13:04] the Baba he said um Phillip how do you
[1:13:07] keep your marriage what's the secret how
[1:13:09] long said you be married for about maybe
[1:13:11] 20 years now so how can you live in 20
[1:13:14] years the same woman how how do you keep
[1:13:17] your marriage how how is it and I said
[1:13:19] my
[1:13:20] friend I don't have no secret I don't
[1:13:23] have no ER
[1:13:25] anything good I do all that I know I've
[1:13:28] committed the hands of God and it's God
[1:13:31] that is keeping that marriage in this
[1:13:33] time of age nobody can keep your
[1:13:36] marriage unless God keep it not only
[1:13:39] your marriage everything that we are
[1:13:40] doing in this time the pressure and the
[1:13:44] environment and everything around is not
[1:13:47] by power or by your might but by my
[1:13:50] spirit says the Lord is the Lord keep us
[1:13:55] we cannot keep
[1:13:56] ourselves he's the one keeping our
[1:13:58] children he's the one keeping our job
[1:14:00] he's the one keeping everything we have
[1:14:03] that's right because in this age it said
[1:14:06] that Prophet said all the people will go
[1:14:09] like
[1:14:10] this except those who have the true
[1:14:14] revelation of the word of God because
[1:14:17] it's a pressure age it's a
[1:14:22] pressure but because
[1:14:25] so he lives in us he lives in you we
[1:14:30] shall overcome because he that overcame
[1:14:33] is in you and it's in me amen and one
[1:14:38] other thing you are
[1:14:41] Justified as if you've not even done it
[1:14:43] in the first place so you don't have to
[1:14:46] worry about anything because the only
[1:14:49] thing that the enemy can put on you if
[1:14:51] your mistakes that you die in this flesh
[1:14:56] he always going to come back but you
[1:14:58] have to recognize that you didn't do it
[1:15:00] in the first place you are Justified
[1:15:03] Justified means that you have not even
[1:15:05] done it somebody was talking about the
[1:15:10] story about a lady who said um a lady
[1:15:15] who said that she's very spiritual she
[1:15:18] see things she see that and the pastor
[1:15:21] just asked her what do you see about me
[1:15:25] in my past the lady said she went she
[1:15:28] checked she said I did not see anything
[1:15:31] he said that's right because there's
[1:15:33] nothing in my past that God remembers
[1:15:35] God doesn't remember nothing that you
[1:15:38] did in the past that was wrong so don't
[1:15:41] focus on that it's in the sea of his
[1:15:45] forgetfulness amen so don't even worry
[1:15:48] about your mistakes let's move
[1:15:51] on let's move on thank you Lord amen
[1:15:54] because must remember the Bible said
[1:15:57] they without us will not be made
[1:16:00] perfect with all those things that you
[1:16:03] read in the Bible you see Abraham you
[1:16:05] see Isaac you see Joseph all those
[1:16:10] characters how big and how we Reverend
[1:16:14] them they are also waiting on us amen
[1:16:20] God has reserved to himself the best for
[1:16:22] the last we are the last
[1:16:26] race that we have the Bon to finish the
[1:16:29] race so let's what with the patience the
[1:16:34] race said before us said forgetting all
[1:16:37] those things behind let's move on Amen
[1:16:41] trust God that he run the race through
[1:16:44] us to finish the race amen he's the same
[1:16:48] yesterday today and forever so that's
[1:16:50] all I have for tonight our eyes of
[1:16:53] understanding he has open up at last
