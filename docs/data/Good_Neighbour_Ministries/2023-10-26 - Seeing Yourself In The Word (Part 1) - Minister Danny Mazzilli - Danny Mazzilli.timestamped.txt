[22:52] Simplicity of his word we want to be
[22:54] able to grow in Christ but we we need
[22:58] the ABCs to be our
[23:01] foundation amen we need to recognize our
[23:04] foundation praise God and so we're going
[23:07] to be um we're continuing along the
[23:09] lines of rapturing Faith series I
[23:12] believe that um this message in this
[23:14] hour um that's that the holy spirit is
[23:17] bringing us to is going to give us the
[23:20] final change where we shall be changed
[23:23] in the moment in the twinkling of an eye
[23:25] that's going to require rapturing faith
[23:28] brother brandham said the Rapture is a
[23:30] revelation and the revelation of God's
[23:33] word and how you fit into God's word and
[23:36] who you are in the word of God must be
[23:40] perfect in your
[23:42] Revelation and when that happens you're
[23:45] going to be
[23:46] changed you're going to be in your
[23:48] position you'll know exactly who you are
[23:51] why you've been called and so let's
[23:54] let's go to the word of God tonight and
[23:56] let's get started tonight we're going to
[23:57] going to just lay in a a foundation um
[24:00] we're not going to keep you late okay
[24:03] this is going to be just a foundation
[24:05] we'll be going deeper into it on Sunday
[24:08] and as we go on this could end up being
[24:11] another five or six um Services because
[24:15] it's um we're going to title this seeing
[24:17] yourself in the
[24:19] word seeing yourself in the word and
[24:23] we're going to focus in on that we're
[24:25] going to look at all the aspects of that
[24:28] and tonight let's just lay let's just uh
[24:30] see how the Holy Spirit lays in the
[24:31] foundation for us amen praise God but
[24:34] it's still going to take your
[24:36] faith for you to see yourself in the
[24:38] word of God Amen let's pray father what
[24:42] a privilege and what an honor it is Lord
[24:45] to uh read your word and then to have
[24:48] the spirit of
[24:49] Revelation upon us to recognize to hear
[24:54] and to act upon your word Lord we ask
[24:56] your blessing upon it tonight anoint uh
[24:59] hearer and speaker Lord give us um such
[25:03] uh encouragement through the word of God
[25:05] lord we give you thanks and we give you
[25:07] praise in Jesus name amen praise God and
[25:12] uh you can put up the uh first slide
[25:15] we're reading from 2 Corinthians chapter
[25:17] 3: 18 it says but we all with open face
[25:23] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[25:27] Lord Lord are changed into the same
[25:31] image from glory to glory even as by the
[25:37] spirit of the Lord amen the Lord add His
[25:41] blessings to the word you may be
[25:43] seated I'm going to read that now from
[25:45] the Amplified
[25:47] version um and I want you to recognize
[25:50] here what it says it
[25:52] says and all of
[25:54] us as with unveiled
[25:58] face because we continue to
[26:02] behold in the word of
[26:05] God as in a mirror the glory of the Lord
[26:11] are constantly being
[26:13] transfigured into his very own image in
[26:18] ever increasing Splendor from one degree
[26:22] of Glory to another for this comes from
[26:25] the Lord who is the
[26:29] spirit praise God hallelujah you know
[26:34] when I read that it just it just
[26:37] exploded into another uh you know like
[26:40] the Roman Candle it just keeps exploding
[26:42] amen because um the word of God is a
[26:46] mirror and uh he's explaining here that
[26:50] that we are actually looking into the
[26:52] mirror of the word of God but we should
[26:55] be actually seeing his very image in us
[27:00] being expressed through the word of God
[27:03] and so when we look into the word of God
[27:05] we should be open face beholding as a
[27:09] glass the glory of the Lord we should be
[27:11] seeing that the word is talking about my
[27:15] experience and what is in store for me
[27:18] as a son or a daughter of God as I grow
[27:23] in the revelation of God's word and
[27:25] especially in the revelation of God's
[27:27] word for this day because the word for
[27:30] this day is producing something that is
[27:35] completely uh unrealized by the
[27:37] Christian world out there remember God
[27:41] is always being praised for what he's
[27:44] going to do for what he's done but they
[27:48] fail to recognize what he's doing right
[27:51] now and this is what you've come into
[27:54] this is your identification you've
[27:57] identified with the word for your day
[28:00] had you been in the day when Jesus was
[28:02] walking the Earth which was the word
[28:04] made flesh walking in the midst of the
[28:07] people would you have recognized him and
[28:10] would you have been able to see that he
[28:13] was actually expressing you that he was
[28:17] calling you that he had come for you you
[28:21] in particular amen that you were the one
[28:23] that he had in his mind when he was
[28:26] walking here on the Earth and you know
[28:28] this message that we've received in this
[28:30] day and in this hour it's all about
[28:32] calling you it's all about God coming to
[28:36] you personally that's the difference
[28:39] between being a Christian in the world
[28:41] out there and being a Christian called
[28:44] of God knowing that you've been called
[28:47] recognizing yourself in the word of God
[28:50] and seeing that you actually have a part
[28:52] in God's plan for this day and it's a
[28:55] Supernatural Part there's there's
[28:57] nothing natural about it it's going to
[28:59] be so Supernatural that you can expect
[29:02] this body to be changed in a moment and
[29:04] in a twinkling of an eye amen praise God
[29:07] hallelujah so when you study the word of
[29:10] God you are actually looking into the
[29:12] mirror of God and you should be seeing
[29:15] yourself in the
[29:18] word what are you seeing are you seeing
[29:20] a god of History a god that is to come
[29:25] or a God that's here right now with you
[29:27] greater is he that is in you than he
[29:29] that is in the world Amen praise God the
[29:33] more you study the more you meditate the
[29:35] more you pray on the word of God what
[29:37] you see is the glory of God hallelujah
[29:41] and that glory is actually the true
[29:43] reflection of who you
[29:46] are we're going to be looking at things
[29:49] throughout this you know as I'm as I'm
[29:51] studying and as I'm preparing you know
[29:53] uh I start I started you know like last
[29:56] week or about two weeks ago the thought
[29:58] was you know on me again about
[30:00] positioning and understanding who we are
[30:03] and our our adoption in the body of
[30:05] Christ and why God has a five-fold
[30:08] Ministry why God is doing what he's
[30:10] doing and how it is that we can identify
[30:14] and know who we are because you know
[30:16] there's a lot of confusion out there
[30:18] right now a lot of people especially in
[30:20] this message there's people that are
[30:23] that that are not identifying themselves
[30:26] with Christ Eve the bride Christ in
[30:31] Bride form now being expressed in this
[30:34] day and in this hour and they have put
[30:36] they'll put everything on on just what
[30:39] the prophet said putting everything just
[30:42] on only what you know you just got to
[30:45] repeat what the prophet said what he
[30:47] said about the bride and how it is and
[30:49] and you know that he never makes any
[30:51] mistakes and you just got to you know
[30:53] you got everything that he said was thus
[30:55] sayeth the Lord you can't alter any part
[30:57] of it you see they're naturally looking
[31:00] at the letter naturally not
[31:04] understanding that it takes divine
[31:06] revelation to know the word of God and
[31:09] what it means and what it means to you
[31:12] and about
[31:14] you how can you just place it all
[31:17] because you know the moment you you just
[31:19] place it all on on well that's the
[31:22] message of the hour there's nothing else
[31:24] I need to know everything I need to know
[31:26] is in the tapes yeah there's a lot in
[31:29] the tapes and everything you probably
[31:31] need to know is in the tapes but do you
[31:33] have a revelation of it that's the
[31:36] difference do you have the spirit of
[31:38] Revelation that was on brother bradam to
[31:41] be able to express the word in such a
[31:43] way that he knew exactly who he was he
[31:46] knew he was Malachi 4 he knew that he
[31:49] was Revelations 10:7 he knew the the
[31:52] part that he had in the word of God and
[31:55] recognized that part and that was for
[31:57] his day and his season but there was
[32:00] prophecy that was coming forth that was
[32:02] going to call a bride that would know
[32:05] her part and what God was going to do in
[32:08] her time her season her age the portion
[32:12] of the word that was being allotted to
[32:15] her because it didn't stop when the
[32:19] prophet went off the scene remember he
[32:21] introduced The Mighty Angel so that the
[32:23] mighty Angel the head could come to meet
[32:25] with the
[32:27] body which is the body of Christ amen
[32:30] glory to
[32:31] God so this you seeing your yourself
[32:36] mirrored in the word of God this is what
[32:38] is called perfect faith in recognizing
[32:42] your day and your position in the body
[32:46] of Christ I know we talk about this all
[32:48] the time but I'm telling you this will
[32:50] never stop
[32:53] unfolding this revelation of who you are
[32:56] it'll never stop unfolding it is Christ
[33:00] The Mystery of God being revealed
[33:03] brother brandom said you know like I was
[33:05] reading you know Christ The Mystery of
[33:07] God revealed and he said that everything
[33:10] that he's been talking about all that
[33:13] he's been preaching all that he's been
[33:15] trying to express was all going to be
[33:18] culminated in that
[33:20] message if you go back and you read that
[33:23] message I'm telling you you've heard it
[33:25] maybe a dozen times twice many times I
[33:27] don't care how many times you heard it
[33:29] but if there's a word that's now in
[33:32] season for you to recognize so that you
[33:34] can receive your perfect Faith you're
[33:37] going to hear things you never heard
[33:39] before I read things over the last
[33:42] couple days I never heard before I might
[33:45] have heard them with my ears I might
[33:47] have read them with my eyes but the
[33:49] spirit of Revelation brought some
[33:51] understanding that was never revealed
[33:54] because God said Now's the Time now's
[33:57] your time now's your season now you're
[34:00] going to you're going to know who you
[34:02] are and you're going to know that you're
[34:04] you're standing on perfect faith in this
[34:06] hour and you're not going to be tossed
[34:09] about or to and fro and and be or in any
[34:12] way shape or form be deceived because
[34:15] Christ The Mystery of God is being
[34:19] revealed in
[34:22] you so we as ministers when we preach
[34:25] the word and we EXP Express the word for
[34:27] our day we read the quotes from brother
[34:30] brandom we're holding up God's
[34:33] mirror and we're we're looking to see
[34:35] who can look into that mirror and say
[34:37] hey that's me hey hey that's me that's
[34:41] me that's in the mirror there that's me
[34:43] that's expressing the word that's me
[34:45] that's recognized the part in the word
[34:47] of God that that that God put put in me
[34:50] in that attribute everything that you
[34:53] are everything that you ever will be in
[34:57] Christ is already in
[35:00] you it just needs to work itself
[35:03] out and it can only happen by Revelation
[35:07] you can't you can't put something like
[35:09] that on you can't uh impersonate
[35:13] something like that that's why the holy
[35:14] spirit said I'm going to come myself in
[35:17] the opening of that seventh seal he says
[35:20] there'll be no interpretation on that he
[35:22] says I'm going to interpret it myself
[35:25] I'm going to go to brother Glenn I'm
[35:27] going to go to brother Jack I'm going to
[35:28] go to brother uh so and so and sister so
[35:31] and so and I'm going to I'm going to I'm
[35:33] going to I'm going to become
[35:34] personalized to them they're going to
[35:37] know that that they know Hallelujah
[35:40] glory to God they're going to know that
[35:42] I am a reality in their life they're
[35:45] going to so believe my word they're
[35:46] going to see signs and wonders and
[35:49] miracles in their own
[35:51] life if you can
[35:54] believe and so as we we we we Proclaim
[35:57] these quotes and we speak the word of
[36:00] God we're proclaiming your identity your
[36:03] representation your abilities all that
[36:07] God put into you he's speaking it into
[36:10] you he's Awakening you he's Awakening
[36:12] that attribute so that you consciously
[36:15] can come it's not that he needs to
[36:17] awaken the attribute because the
[36:18] attribute is God but he's Awakening your
[36:21] Consciousness your level of awareness so
[36:24] that you can
[36:25] see
[36:28] not in a dark
[36:31] place but you can see
[36:34] clearly who you
[36:36] are Hallelujah glory to God Amen it's
[36:40] your name it's your name written in the
[36:43] Lamb's Book of Life and that's why you
[36:45] can see you can recognize you can
[36:47] believe this word
[36:50] hallelujah you may have thought that you
[36:52] were undeserving of Salvation you know
[36:54] because now now we're going to look at
[36:56] some things we're going to look at some
[36:58] some
[36:59] aspects and some thinking uh processes
[37:03] that you know that that we have to deal
[37:04] with as humans listen I can come up here
[37:08] and I can start preaching mystery after
[37:10] mystery after mystery and it'll all be a
[37:12] it'll all just still be a mystery by the
[37:14] time you leave here if you don't learn
[37:16] the ABCs and recognize how the enemy is
[37:19] trying to defeat you and how to how the
[37:22] enemy is trying to distract you from the
[37:24] word that you are the part that you're
[37:26] supposed to fulfill the purpose why
[37:29] you've been called you're just coming to
[37:31] church you're just you're walking in
[37:33] those doors and leaving those doors in
[37:35] the same way that you came in unless you
[37:37] can recognize and are willing to
[37:41] overcome your own physical human
[37:46] weaknesses you need to
[37:49] overcome in Revelations 3 it says to
[37:51] them that overcome in this church age
[37:54] will I allow to sit with me in my Throne
[37:57] what what do you mean sit with you in
[37:59] your throne Lord you mean now you mean
[38:01] actually recognize that you're that you
[38:04] are in Christ that he is in you and that
[38:07] that is your hope of glory and that you
[38:09] can overcome Now by The Power of
[38:11] revelation of knowing who you are yes
[38:15] exactly and so you need to understand
[38:18] that you're that listen you you you
[38:21] don't deserve what came to you so let's
[38:24] get this straight it's nothing that you
[38:27] did you oh I I I I deserve this because
[38:30] I lived a good life you know so I
[38:32] deserve to receive the message of the
[38:34] hour God had to come to me because I was
[38:37] a good boy or I was a good girl has
[38:39] nothing to do with that the attribute of
[38:43] God landed In
[38:45] Your Vessel by the grace of
[38:49] God it's just the grace of God that's it
[38:53] period there go I but for the grace of
[38:55] God I you you were a sinner you were
[38:58] born in sin you were shaped in sin you
[39:01] were shaped in iniquity speaking lies
[39:03] you're no better than anybody else but
[39:06] Grace came your
[39:08] way Hallelujah go to the next
[39:13] slide it says here brother Bram speaking
[39:15] he
[39:17] says in the message Fellowship by
[39:21] Redemption he says well we through
[39:25] wrongdoings well we through wrongdoings
[39:28] are red through your sins though your
[39:32] sins be like Scarlet Red through the
[39:35] shed blood of the Lord Jesus God looking
[39:38] through there red through red looks
[39:42] white they shall be white like snow see
[39:46] not through your something else but
[39:49] through the blood the only place that he
[39:53] can Fellowship outside of there your own
[39:57] righteousness he'll you'll he'll never
[40:00] see it your good works he'll never know
[40:03] it until you come beneath the blood then
[40:07] he sees you as his own beloved son or
[40:13] his daughter
[40:15] period your salvation comes through the
[40:18] blood of Jesus Christ people still don't
[40:22] want to recognize that listen you people
[40:24] out in YouTube world you people people
[40:26] whoever are hearing this message Jesus
[40:29] Christ I don't care what faith what
[40:31] religion it's Jesus Christ he is the
[40:34] Lord and savior he was the one that came
[40:38] to this world he gave his own life to to
[40:42] to take your place because you're born
[40:45] in sin you're shaped in iniquity Jesus
[40:48] Christ is
[40:50] God God came and took your sin upon
[40:55] himself and he can only see you through
[40:58] you accepting that his blood was shed he
[41:02] died for you on the cross it's as simple
[41:05] as that other than that you're you're
[41:07] you're sin before God unless you accept
[41:11] the blood of Jesus red through red looks
[41:15] white so when God sees the the the sin
[41:18] and all the unbelief of your life but
[41:20] then sees it through the blood he sees
[41:23] you white as snow glory to God through
[41:26] bread is white no matter what you've
[41:28] done sinner sinner friend when God looks
[41:32] sees your confessed your sins as being
[41:35] wrong and God looks through the blood of
[41:38] the Lord Jesus he sees you White Snow
[41:41] White no matter what you've done
[41:44] hallelujah that's true salvation you
[41:48] need to recognize that before you can go
[41:51] on and and and see yourself in the word
[41:53] of God you'll never see yourself in the
[41:55] word of God God unless you've come to a
[41:57] place where you know that you're saved
[42:01] that you're washed that you're Justified
[42:04] that there's nothing that that that can
[42:06] hold you back from fulfilling the part
[42:08] of the word that you are amen praise God
[42:11] no matter what you've done he is looking
[42:14] through you through Christ's blood your
[42:18] redeemed precious thing God will never
[42:21] condemn you no more he can't condemn you
[42:26] am God is no Indian giver God is not
[42:29] going to save you today and lose you
[42:31] tomorrow oh well I did this and I did
[42:34] that I'm lost no you're not if you're a
[42:37] son or a daughter of God you will feel
[42:40] that prick in your heart we're going to
[42:42] look a little further here let's let's
[42:43] let's move on so by the Holy Spirit
[42:47] Jesus Christ now next slide let's read
[42:50] the
[42:52] scripture you need to see 2 Corinthians
[42:55] 5:21 for he he hath made him to be sin
[42:58] for us who knew no
[43:01] sin that we might be made the
[43:04] righteousness of God in him so God
[43:07] became sin God took on sin and took it
[43:12] to the Cross when he went to the Cross
[43:14] he took you with him to the
[43:16] Cross because you were identified in
[43:19] Christ so when he died you died when he
[43:24] nailed sin to the Cross he nailed your
[43:26] sin to the Cross there is no more sin
[43:29] there is no more condemnation to them
[43:32] that are in Christ Jesus if you're in
[43:34] Christ Jesus there's no way that Satan
[43:37] can can can put condemnation on you but
[43:41] he does anyhow and a lot of us bow down
[43:44] to it but we're going to try and change
[43:47] that kind of stinking thinking amen
[43:50] praise God we need to look at some of
[43:52] these processes so understand
[43:56] that you become the very righteousness
[43:59] of God that that if there was any
[44:03] righteousness in God remember he thought
[44:06] his righteousness his righteousness was
[44:09] expressed in attribute form and you are
[44:14] the righteousness of God when you accept
[44:17] the blood of Christ and him going to the
[44:21] Cross so if you are the righteousness of
[44:24] Christ How can any
[44:27] unbelief take you it can't take you you
[44:32] can be temporarily deceived you can be
[44:35] temporarily uh held back you can
[44:37] backslide because of condemnation
[44:39] because the devil's trapped you into
[44:41] believing that you're something that
[44:43] you're not but if you're an attribute of
[44:46] God and you've you've got a revelation
[44:48] of that there's no way you could ever be
[44:51] deceived but let's look at these
[44:53] processes we need to take a look at some
[44:55] some of these thought processes in us
[44:59] that constantly hinder us from seeing
[45:02] the mirror of God's word and seeing God
[45:05] in our lives and how we are reflecting
[45:09] Christ in this day and in this hour amen
[45:12] we need to look at these human thought
[45:14] patterns that need to be exposed and
[45:17] cast
[45:18] out now young people listen
[45:23] up number one
[45:26] there's this thought pattern that I must
[45:28] be loved or approved by virtually
[45:31] everyone that I
[45:34] know people want to be loved people want
[45:36] to be people want approval people want
[45:40] to know that that that that that they're
[45:42] pleasing everybody so that they can be
[45:45] loved by everybody that's not the way it
[45:49] works there's black and then there's
[45:52] white there's belief and there's
[45:54] unbelief unbelief has no fellowship with
[45:57] belief it's as simple as that although
[46:00] we're living in a world where we're
[46:02] surrounded completely surrounded by by
[46:05] unbelief and and and faith we don't have
[46:09] to bow down to that and allow that
[46:12] thought process to control us because if
[46:16] there's ever been a day where where
[46:17] deception is being advertised and being
[46:21] promoted through through media and
[46:24] through your iPhones and your iPads and
[46:26] your computers you're constantly being
[46:29] bombarded with with how to fit in and
[46:32] how and you must look and how listen
[46:35] listen listen here it says if we're
[46:37] living to make sure that others love us
[46:40] we give them the
[46:42] permission we're giving them the very
[46:46] permission to evaluate us and tell us
[46:49] how we are and how we should
[46:53] be no that's not the way it should be
[46:57] amen we give the people the power to
[47:01] determine our
[47:04] selfworth you mean you're going to allow
[47:06] somebody that's that that that does you
[47:08] know a a Tik Tock or whatever they call
[47:11] it uh and and every day they're they're
[47:14] showing you the way that you got to put
[47:15] on your
[47:17] makeup and they got a Blog and they got
[47:19] 500,000 followers and because they got
[47:22] 500,000 followers they must know how I
[47:25] should put on my makeup every
[47:27] day and how I should make myself so that
[47:31] I can look the best that I can be
[47:33] because if I don't look the best that I
[47:35] can possibly be then I'm not going to be
[47:37] accepted I'm not going to be
[47:40] loved you need to be who God made you
[47:44] you need to know that you are in
[47:46] particular a special person a special
[47:48] individual in the mind of God and God
[47:51] made you exactly the way that you are so
[47:54] that you could fulfill the word of God
[47:56] in your
[47:58] day Hallelujah many of us are so
[48:01] concerned about being loved that we give
[48:04] up now watch now listen to you young
[48:06] people you give into the opposite
[48:09] sex because you're a woman and you want
[48:12] you want a man or you're a man and
[48:14] you're looking for a woman and you start
[48:16] to give up your own identity you start
[48:18] to put on things that you are
[48:20] not you start to show likes and dislikes
[48:25] that are not really your likes and
[48:27] dislikes but because you want to be
[48:30] accepted you start to emulate those
[48:36] things I'm speaking to somebody here
[48:39] tonight Hallelujah and you're letting
[48:41] them evaluate your selfworth by you by
[48:45] you uh uh you know sacrificing your own
[48:49] identity so that you can get attention
[48:51] and acceptance from your friends no
[48:56] even to the extent of pretending that
[49:00] you're not as smart because your friends
[49:04] are maybe not as smart and you're a lot
[49:05] smarter than them and so you start
[49:07] acting
[49:09] dumb like you know listen I'm thinking
[49:12] about my my my my teenage years these
[49:15] things started to flash back you know I
[49:19] always knew that I was different but yet
[49:22] when I was with my teenage friends at 18
[49:24] 19 20 years old
[49:26] Macho this Macho that everybody wanted
[49:28] to be Mr this that and you know wanted
[49:30] to catch all the attention of the girls
[49:32] and the girls wanted to catch the
[49:34] attention of the boys you would see them
[49:36] at school and then you would see them at
[49:38] the at the Disco Tech and they were two
[49:40] different
[49:41] people because they were trying to show
[49:43] that they were something else so that
[49:45] they could be identified and so that
[49:47] they could be
[49:49] noticed God made you special you need to
[49:52] be exactly what God made you to be h
[49:55] Hallelujah glory to God pretending not
[49:58] to be bright or kind because we think
[50:01] the opposite sex won't be impressed you
[50:04] know men got to put on Macho they got to
[50:06] show that they're that they're tough so
[50:07] they're so so so they act mean around
[50:10] other
[50:12] people down to earth stuff
[50:17] no or we might deny ourselves food we
[50:21] might deny ourselves because we want to
[50:23] we want to look so thin we want to we
[50:26] want to deny ourselves food we want to
[50:28] and then all of a sudden you know you
[50:29] you you start to become bulimic you
[50:31] start to become anorexic you start to
[50:33] find yourself in a situation and a
[50:36] condition that you wish you never went
[50:37] down that road because now Satan's got
[50:39] you
[50:40] trapped all because you're not
[50:43] identifying yourself with the word and
[50:46] you're allowing the world to identify
[50:52] you I want to look like those
[50:55] bodybuilders in the
[50:56] magazines so I'm going to go to the gym
[50:59] and I'm going to start doing just like
[51:01] the bodybuilders do and I'm going to
[51:03] become Mr Macho I'm gonna go there with
[51:05] my bikini on and I'm gonna look just
[51:07] like uh Mr
[51:12] Hollywood these are the kind of
[51:14] deceptions that are out there and
[51:16] they're attacking our young
[51:18] people and we need to let them know that
[51:21] no God didn't make you that way God made
[51:23] you special and he set you aside for his
[51:27] service and for his purpose and for his
[51:29] glory and you're going to be glad when
[51:32] the Great Tribulation strikes the earth
[51:34] and the Rapture takes place and you've
[51:37] been you've been spared all of the
[51:40] destruction that's coming down upon the
[51:41] Earth don't tell me you can't see it out
[51:44] there it
[51:45] started it started this didn't just
[51:48] start you know uh last two weeks ago
[51:51] this has been going on for many many
[51:53] many years everything is is surrounding
[51:56] Israel it's always been surrounding
[51:58] Israel go back into the history you'll
[52:00] see that it's all surrounding uh
[52:03] Israel and it will eventually climax
[52:07] into a World War II it's going to happen
[52:09] according to the word of God not because
[52:11] I said it but because the word says
[52:14] clearly there'll be a World War I and
[52:16] there was it said there' be a World War
[52:19] Two and there was it says there'll be a
[52:22] World War II and it's coming God sent us
[52:25] a prophet that saw by Vision everything
[52:30] that was going to happen even before
[52:32] World War I brother brandham had visions
[52:35] of exactly who was going to be leading
[52:39] World War II and who uh Hitler was and
[52:42] even named him before he came on the
[52:46] scene that's what God can do God did
[52:49] that for you so that God could vindicate
[52:52] that William brandham was not just some
[52:54] man shooting off his own ideas and his
[52:57] own prophecies and saying thus sayeth
[53:00] the Lord for for for just to get people
[53:02] to follow him no sir he was a Vindicated
[53:06] prophet of God God confirmed that the
[53:09] supernatural was around his life and the
[53:12] things that he said they came to pass
[53:15] there's people that will say yeah but he
[53:17] said this and that didn't come to pass
[53:19] he said this and and that didn't come to
[53:21] pass it might have not come to pass
[53:23] according to the way you see it
[53:26] but God has his own way of interpreting
[53:28] the word of God and God is his own
[53:31] interpreter and you're not the one
[53:32] that's going to interpret the
[53:34] word you're going to fulfill the
[53:37] word
[53:39] hallelujah and so you know if we are
[53:42] living to make sure that others love us
[53:45] we give people the power to determine
[53:47] our selfworth no sir this is not a son
[53:52] or a daughter of God this is not how
[53:54] they see themselves in the word of God
[53:57] Amen and even within the church even
[54:00] within our church Community we start to
[54:03] take on certain
[54:05] stereotypes we start to look at oh well
[54:07] this is the way a woman should be and
[54:09] this is the only way that she should
[54:10] dress and this is exactly how she should
[54:12] do her hair and this is and we start
[54:15] stereotyping everything and you become
[54:17] like a clone or a
[54:19] robot and you start identifying yourself
[54:22] as a stereotype in the message of the
[54:24] hour and you actually neglect your
[54:28] position and your gift and your purpose
[54:31] in the word of God when you start
[54:32] focusing in that area you're missing
[54:36] your part because you're trying to uh
[54:39] put on the message culture this is not
[54:42] message culture this is you and Christ
[54:46] this is you personal every young person
[54:48] in here needs to be birthed and Born
[54:51] Again by the word of God and receive

[58:37] you're tuned in on YouTube and you're

[58:44] he's releasing a word in this day in
[58:48] this hour in October the 25th 2023
[58:52] there's a release of super superatural
[58:55] faith and Revelation that's coming into
[58:58] the bride of Christ that receives this
[59:00] word that believes this word that knows
[59:02] that it's a reality God is doing
[59:05] something right now it's it's called the
[59:08] progression of Revelation and you can't
[59:10] miss it when you're tuned into it amen
[59:13] praise God hallelujah glory to God let's
[59:16] look at the next
[59:18] thing number
[59:20] two my past
[59:22] history is an
[59:25] determiner of my present behavior and
[59:29] because something once affected my life
[59:32] in the past that's just who I am I hear
[59:35] people say that I say I hear people say
[59:38] listen brother that's just the way God
[59:41] you know that's just the way you know H
[59:43] I am I'm I'm
[59:45] miserable a lot of the
[59:47] times I
[59:51] gossip I talk about others
[59:57] that's because when I was at home I
[59:59] heard my mom and my dad they were always
[1:00:02] talking about somebody so I talk about
[1:00:05] people you
[1:00:07] see that's a spirit that's a demon
[1:00:12] that's
[1:00:13] unbelief that's not who you are you're
[1:00:16] an
[1:00:17] overcomer you your your your your your
[1:00:20] your old life should be left in the past
[1:00:25] there are certain aspects of your your
[1:00:28] your environment and your upbringing
[1:00:31] that are positive and those are the
[1:00:34] things that you need to
[1:00:36] accentuate those are the aspects that
[1:00:38] you need to allow to stay in your life
[1:00:41] I'm I'm a hard worker because I watched
[1:00:44] my mom and dad they worked hard all
[1:00:46] their life so I work and I work too much
[1:00:50] but hey I'd rather be caught working too
[1:00:53] much than doing nothing nothing for the
[1:00:55] Lord and so so there's certain aspects
[1:00:58] of your character that God developed you
[1:01:01] in that way because he needs those parts
[1:01:03] in the body of Christ but he doesn't
[1:01:06] need backbiting gossiping and and uh uh
[1:01:10] two-faced UN unbelievers in the house of
[1:01:12] the Lord he doesn't need that at
[1:01:15] all
[1:01:17] Hallelujah so we allow that you feel
[1:01:21] controlled by something from the past a
[1:01:24] SE secret that only you know
[1:01:27] about and rightfully so some things some
[1:01:30] things should never be expressed except
[1:01:33] before God because there's things in
[1:01:35] your past and things that you might have
[1:01:37] done that that you know that that the
[1:01:39] devil keeps bringing it up on you some
[1:01:42] kind of behavior some secret sin
[1:01:44] something that you just you you know you
[1:01:47] you you just feel condemned all all the
[1:01:49] time but God made a way for you to
[1:01:52] confess that sin and be set free when
[1:01:55] you receive this
[1:01:57] message when you receive this message
[1:02:00] you you have no right going back to
[1:02:02] those areas and if you do it's because
[1:02:04] you were
[1:02:05] trapped by a certain thought process in
[1:02:09] your mind that said well this this
[1:02:11] happened to me when I was young that
[1:02:13] happened to me I got exposed to
[1:02:15] pornography I got exposed to this I got
[1:02:18] Expose and and all of those things now
[1:02:20] they're they're controlling me no you've
[1:02:22] been birthed by the word of God God
[1:02:24] there's an overcomer in you greater is
[1:02:27] he that is in you than he that is in the
[1:02:30] world you will overcome by the word of
[1:02:34] God that is in your mouth and you will
[1:02:37] speak that word and you will tell that
[1:02:39] enemy you have no right over me and God
[1:02:42] will deliver you it's as simple as
[1:02:46] that God didn't trap you and leave you
[1:02:49] trapped God has made a way for you to
[1:02:52] escape he will never never allow
[1:02:55] anything more to come into your life and
[1:02:58] stay in your life God has made a way for
[1:03:00] you out of that situation
[1:03:05] amen glory to
[1:03:07] God
[1:03:09] hallelujah perhaps you feel ashamed
[1:03:11] about certain aspects of your family you
[1:03:14] grew up in or maybe you have sinful
[1:03:16] habits you're embarrassed about you know
[1:03:19] gossiping and all these things maybe
[1:03:21] you're ashamed of some things that
[1:03:23] you've done in the past or maybe
[1:03:24] something that happened to you or that
[1:03:26] you've done to somebody else you need to
[1:03:29] come to Christ you need to come to the
[1:03:31] blood you need to get you need to be
[1:03:33] cleansed and purged so that God can move
[1:03:36] you into your
[1:03:38] position Hallelujah you've got an
[1:03:40] important part and it's important to
[1:03:43] identify you know when when when you're
[1:03:45] feeling these these these Spirits uh or
[1:03:48] these feelings of condemnation or or
[1:03:53] what what are they
[1:03:54] now let's look at
[1:03:56] it it's important to identify whether
[1:03:59] our feelings in these situations these
[1:04:02] these uh destructive uh uh memories
[1:04:05] whether they're they destructive shame
[1:04:08] or healthy
[1:04:09] conviction because if you're if you're
[1:04:12] ashamed of the things that you
[1:04:14] do then you should feel convicted
[1:04:17] because you know that you're doing it
[1:04:20] and that's and that's and that's uh
[1:04:22] something that you can immediately
[1:04:24] do something to change that behavior you
[1:04:27] should immediately be doing things to
[1:04:29] change that that type of behavior then
[1:04:33] there's healthy conviction healthy
[1:04:35] conviction always separates our identity
[1:04:38] from our
[1:04:39] Behavior shame links these two so wrong
[1:04:43] behaviors taint our image of ourself
[1:04:47] healthy convictions alert us to the fact
[1:04:50] that we have done something that goes
[1:04:53] against our are internalized values so
[1:04:57] when you're being healthy convicted in
[1:04:59] your heart that's a good thing it's like
[1:05:03] Christ it's like a Biblical conviction
[1:05:06] is a god-given emotion when you look
[1:05:08] into the word of God and the word of God
[1:05:10] tells you that this is not right that's
[1:05:13] not right this is the way that that that
[1:05:15] a son or a daughter of God should act
[1:05:18] and behave those are biblical
[1:05:20] convictions which we need to recognize
[1:05:23] and that comes right here in the house
[1:05:25] of the Lord when you assemble yourself
[1:05:28] and receive the word of God and and get
[1:05:30] the correction that you need so that you
[1:05:32] can be set
[1:05:33] free hallelujah praise God healthy
[1:05:37] conviction praise God it Spurs us to
[1:05:41] confess our sin and experience the
[1:05:44] Forgiveness of
[1:05:46] Christ glory to God Amen it provides us
[1:05:50] an opportunity where we can recognize
[1:05:53] first John 1 to9 tells us if we confess
[1:05:56] our sins God is faithful and just to
[1:06:00] forgive us our sins and cleanse us he
[1:06:03] cleanses us from all
[1:06:06] unrighteousness remember you are the
[1:06:08] righteousness of God you are the
[1:06:11] righteousness of Christ but you're
[1:06:13] living in this human realm and in this
[1:06:15] human body that is constantly sinning
[1:06:18] you're going to sin a thousand times a
[1:06:20] day you're going to think things in your
[1:06:22] mind about your brother and your sister
[1:06:24] that you don't want to think and you're
[1:06:28] going to struggle with those thoughts
[1:06:30] you're going to struggle with them but
[1:06:32] that's the enemy trying to get you to to
[1:06:35] to accept those things speak those
[1:06:38] things and then manifest it into gossip
[1:06:41] or talking about one or or the other and
[1:06:44] all of a sudden you've just you've just
[1:06:46] put out an evil report and you're going
[1:06:49] to have to be accountable for
[1:06:51] that because it's going to come right
[1:06:53] back back and slap you right in the back
[1:06:56] of the head it's as simple as that you
[1:06:58] think listen God is perfecting this
[1:07:01] church God wants to get you cleaned up
[1:07:04] so that you can get into your position
[1:07:07] and be effective in the body of Christ
[1:07:10] but he needs to clean up your attitude
[1:07:12] he needs to get rid of those negative
[1:07:15] attitudes and those negative uh uh
[1:07:17] dispositions those those those cold
[1:07:21] Spirits you know oh they don't come to
[1:07:23] meet say hello I ain't saying hello to
[1:07:27] them demons from the pits of Hell try to
[1:07:30] come into your mind and yet if you're
[1:07:34] recognizing that you're expressing a
[1:07:36] cold Spirit shame on
[1:07:38] you why would you express a cold spirit
[1:07:42] in the house of the Lord where he says
[1:07:45] that you are in Christ and in love and
[1:07:48] love conquers all things and if you
[1:07:51] project love into any situation God's
[1:07:55] grace will take over and you will
[1:07:58] experience the love of God and not only
[1:08:00] will your sister or your brother be free
[1:08:03] you'll be free you're in bondage because
[1:08:06] of your own mental attitude
[1:08:10] period you are responsible for your own
[1:08:13] attitudes you are responsible for being
[1:08:17] and expressing and showing your you want
[1:08:19] friends what's the Bible says about
[1:08:22] wanting friends Show Yourself friendly
[1:08:25] thank you brother Bill Show Yourself
[1:08:29] friendly not
[1:08:31] miserable you should have a smile on
[1:08:34] your face you want to learn watch
[1:08:36] brother Desmond he
[1:08:39] greets he
[1:08:41] smiles he's he's expressing the joy of
[1:08:44] the Lord God has put that into the body
[1:08:46] of Christ for a purpose you want to
[1:08:48] emulate certain things emulate those
[1:08:51] things think on those things that are
[1:08:53] good think on those things that are pure
[1:08:56] think about how the body of Christ gets
[1:08:58] affected I was reading that today how
[1:09:01] brother Brandon was it's right in the
[1:09:02] Christ the mystery of God revealed how
[1:09:04] God how brother brm was speaking about
[1:09:06] how the devil is going to come in and
[1:09:08] he's going to inject somebody with a
[1:09:10] wrong spirit and he's going to try to
[1:09:12] pull you away and he's going to try to
[1:09:14] get you to separate from one another he
[1:09:17] that's one of Satan's greatest Avenues
[1:09:20] of breaking up a church or bringing
[1:09:22] unbelief or you you know breaking the
[1:09:25] unity in the church starts to inject
[1:09:27] somebody with a miserable spirit and
[1:09:30] they're miserable all the time they
[1:09:31] don't want to show themselves that the
[1:09:33] that the joy of the Lord is actually
[1:09:35] their strength they're showing their
[1:09:37] weakness they're showing absolute
[1:09:40] weakness when they're expressing that
[1:09:41] kind of an attitude they don't realize
[1:09:44] it but it can change you don't have to
[1:09:46] be stuck under those thought patterns
[1:09:48] anymore you don't have to be controlled
[1:09:50] by those thought patterns anymore you
[1:09:52] can live liberate ated and free and you
[1:09:55] can experience the love of God that
[1:09:57] comes into the midst of our fellowship
[1:09:59] when we have that same like Precious
[1:10:02] faith in the unity of the spirit and we
[1:10:04] come together under that kind of
[1:10:08] Liberty hallelujah praise God forever
[1:10:11] more biblical conviction is a god-given
[1:10:13] emotion that red flags of behavior and
[1:10:17] tells us it is an act of rebellion
[1:10:20] against
[1:10:22] God
[1:10:25] when you're doing those things and when
[1:10:27] you're expressing those attitudes you
[1:10:29] are rebelling against God because you
[1:10:33] identify yourself as being in the body
[1:10:35] of Christ and you're going to have that
[1:10:38] kind of an
[1:10:39] attitude that does not express Christ
[1:10:42] that does not edify me I'm looking for
[1:10:45] edification we're going to be looking at
[1:10:47] things as we go into this series we're
[1:10:49] going to wind it right down now that
[1:10:51] that you're going to be looking at how
[1:10:53] each each joint we're going to be
[1:10:55] looking at scripture how each joint it
[1:10:59] nourishes each joint regardless of where
[1:11:03] that joint is it could be the the the
[1:11:05] the the cleaner the the the the one that
[1:11:07] that vacuums brother Eugene right here
[1:11:09] in the sanctuary that's vacuuming
[1:11:11] consistently every Sunday that is a
[1:11:14] joint that nourishes the the the body of
[1:11:17] Jesus Christ and it brings him into the
[1:11:20] perfect Unity of the faith when he's
[1:11:22] doing it by faith not because he's angry
[1:11:24] ah these people are throwing their
[1:11:26] garbage on the floor all the time I'm
[1:11:29] the only one that does this over here
[1:11:31] that does not no I don't see that that's
[1:11:34] not the kind of attitude that's going to
[1:11:35] edify the body of
[1:11:38] Christ when we get to the other side
[1:11:40] there's no difference between you me and
[1:11:42] anybody else we're just positioned in a
[1:11:45] certain way for the purpose of God and
[1:11:47] for God's
[1:11:49] glory you can't be what I am I can't be
[1:11:52] what you are
[1:11:54] because God made you to be who you are
[1:11:56] and God made me to be who I
[1:11:58] am
[1:12:00] Hallelujah and so for us to move to our
[1:12:03] full potential we need to break through
[1:12:06] these these foundational uh uh patterns
[1:12:10] mental oppressions and mental
[1:12:12] destructions and great battles that we
[1:12:14] have to deal with in our minds over and
[1:12:17] over and over again amen praise God I'm
[1:12:19] gonna move quickly here we're going to
[1:12:21] finish this
[1:12:22] up it says here that I got to be
[1:12:26] thoroughly now this is another lie of
[1:12:28] the enemy that I got to be thoroughly
[1:12:30] perfect adequate and and and and
[1:12:33] everything that I do I got to do it just
[1:12:35] perfect so that everybody can love me
[1:12:38] and and and and think that I'm worth
[1:12:41] anything that's not the way it works God
[1:12:43] didn't make you perfect in
[1:12:46] everything God made a perfect heart but
[1:12:50] he made the heart different from the
[1:12:51] liver the liver operates and does things
[1:12:54] that the heart doesn't do without the
[1:12:57] heart the liver doesn't work without the
[1:13:00] without the liver the heart stops to
[1:13:01] pump and dies everything is connected
[1:13:04] and everything has a part and a placing
[1:13:06] in the word of God Amen but you're not
[1:13:09] perfect and what happens is you get
[1:13:11] caught into this other pandemic that
[1:13:14] we're dealing with right now because
[1:13:15] you're you're you're you're placing an
[1:13:17] expectation upon your life on things
[1:13:20] that you think that you should be doing
[1:13:21] you're not adequately equipped to do it
[1:13:24] but you think that you have to do it and
[1:13:26] what does it do it throws you into
[1:13:28] depression you know that depression is a
[1:13:30] big huge pandemic out there right now
[1:13:33] it's that it's attacking our young
[1:13:35] people like never before their teen
[1:13:37] suicide like never before because they
[1:13:40] think that they got to be a certain way
[1:13:42] and because they're not that perfect
[1:13:44] they don't have that perfect nose they
[1:13:47] don't have those perfect
[1:13:49] ears they don't have that thick hair
[1:13:52] they don't have those perfect
[1:13:54] eyelashes and so they start to look at
[1:13:57] themselves and they they they start to
[1:13:58] make themselves and to try to uh uh make
[1:14:01] themselves something that they're
[1:14:02] absolutely not they're trying to make
[1:14:04] themselves perfect and before you know
[1:14:05] it they fall into a depression an
[1:14:08] oppression it's mental attacks of the
[1:14:11] enemy to try to make you something that
[1:14:13] you are not be who you are brother
[1:14:16] Glenn don't look to be anything else
[1:14:19] don't don't look at what other people uh
[1:14:23] uh how the other people react around you
[1:14:26] to determine that they like me or they
[1:14:28] don't like me if you're showing yourself
[1:14:31] friendly and you're showing the love of
[1:14:33] God and you have no motive other than
[1:14:35] Christ to to to do something good for
[1:14:38] your brother and your sister and that
[1:14:40] motive is there then don't worry God's
[1:14:43] got to deal with them not you but if you
[1:14:45] start to fall into the Trap of you start
[1:14:48] talking about it you start getting
[1:14:49] bitter you start getting rebellious you
[1:14:51] start getting angry you're just as bad
[1:14:53] as they are that's why Jesus said if
[1:14:56] they slap you on this cheek turn the
[1:14:59] other why was he saying that so that you
[1:15:02] wouldn't want to immediately slap back
[1:15:05] you want to react in such a way that
[1:15:07] when that one slaps you again he's
[1:15:09] thinking holy smokes there was no
[1:15:13] reaction I need to be like
[1:15:16] that I need that kind of a character
[1:15:20] God's looking for
[1:15:21] character Hallelujah
[1:15:24] and so when we start to express Grace
[1:15:29] and we start to extend Grace God's grace
[1:15:33] then God's grace comes back on
[1:15:35] us that's why we hear project love and
[1:15:40] grace takes over because it comes back
[1:15:42] on you love comes right back to you amen
[1:15:46] glory to God hallelujah 1 Corinthians
[1:15:50] 12:27 now I'm going to end with this
[1:15:54] I got more here but maybe we'll start
[1:15:55] out with what I've got here I don't want
[1:15:58] to get into what I've got here because
[1:16:00] it's good and I I want to cover it
[1:16:03] thoroughly so uh I'm GNA end with this

[1:16:09] you God did not make you to be anybody
[1:16:13] else in in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 let
[1:16:17] the musicians come in 1 Corinthians 12:
[1:16:20] 27 it says now ye are are the body of
[1:16:24] Christ and

[1:16:55] me I can express all that I am you can
[1:16:58] express all that you are because you are
[1:17:01] a member in the body of Christ in
[1:17:04] particular you have a unique position in
[1:17:08] Christ and when you operate in that
[1:17:10] position and you do it with the love of
[1:17:12] God and by faith it edifies it blesses
[1:17:17] it prospers it anoints it wants people
[1:17:20] to be like you to have the same kind of
[1:17:23] character to show that kind of love to
[1:17:26] be that kind of a person and all of a
[1:17:28] sudden God starts to add to the church
[1:17:31] God starts to build on the church
[1:17:33] because now he sees that his people have
[1:17:35] the character they don't have the wrong
[1:17:38] attitude they don't look at uh uh uh
