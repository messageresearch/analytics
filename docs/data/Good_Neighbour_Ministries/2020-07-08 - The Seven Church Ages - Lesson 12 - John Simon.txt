The Seven Church Ages Bible Lesson 12
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good evening friends once again we are gathered together for a marvelous and wonderful Bible study as I teach on the Word of God and made a great holy spirit anoint the Word of God to our the heirs of our hearts and to the eyes of our understanding let us pray our gracious God and Heavenly Father we ask thy blessing upon this life word today made a great Holy Spirit take praise honor and glory in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord amen and amen as we said before our subject tonight will be the believers rest and my aim is to show you that there is no rest there is no peace until our satisfaction until we come to a place a condition a zone in which we live in continuous inner rest inner wrist may God bless our hearts today as we sink upon these things now first of all we find that there are wonderful brothers and sisters in Christ that call the Lord's Day the Sabbath day or Saturday they believe it's Saturday then there are other wonderful justice wonderful wonderful fine folks that will call Sunday the Lord's Day the first day of the week now we understood stand it could not be either one of these days or even if we were to put those two days together Saturday and Sunday they still will not be really and truly the lord's day for we know that John was in the spirit and he was in the spirit over a period of about receiving visions over a period of about two years ninety five eighty to ninety six eighty and actually what happened is that John was caught up in the spirit he was transported by the Holy Spirit transported into the future by the Holy Spirit God's time capsule or like Captain Kirk was beamed up God beamed him or transported him spiritually into the future so that he could come back and John write these things in a book and so John was able to write his visions his experiences while he was caught up in the spirit of God and transported into a future day the lord's day that is in the future because we know the Bible tells us that the Lord's Day is coming God's Day is coming and John is seeing those things of that future date meanwhile we are here now in some of that future that John was speaking about and the question is that we want to find out exactly what is the Sabbath day today what is it today when we know that the Sabbath from the New Testament is not the keeping of a certain day let me repeat we know from the New Testament and the teachings of the Apostles that the Sabbath day is not a certain date now in the book of Hebrews chapter 4 verses 8 9 and 10 let's read from verse 9 there remaineth therefore I rest for the people of God for he that is entered into his rest he also has ceased from his old works as God did from his may God help us to cease from our fleshly Whirley works and our human efforts and to learn how to rest in the blessed holy spirit who has come to lead us to guide us to straightness encourages comfort us and to take us all the way from Earth to glory rest upon him back there they had the pillar of fire they could see with their eyes but now he talked also told us clearly that he will go away what book return in the farm of the Blessed Holy Spirit our eyes may not be able to see him but we love him with our hearts and he promised even though you would see me I'll be with you even in you to the very end of the age so here we are friends Hebrew Hebrews tells us clearly that the this rest when one enters into this rest he ceases from his Labor's now the key phrase there is God ceased from his own works no God gave Israel the nation of Israel this seven-day for their Sabbath or Saturday if we want to call it that God gave Israel the seventh day as their seventh now and that was in commemoration for them to remember or as a memorial that he created the world over that period of time and that he rested from his own works and if he rested then they ought to rest now we know clearly friends that this Sabbath day was given to Israel as a memorial to commemorate God's work it was not given to the Gentiles as a commemoration of his works but it was given unto the Jewish brethren as a memorial to God and His great works of creation now we find friends that when God had finished creating when he has cease from his labors then he rested and it was fine to give a day as of rest to his people in Memorial of that for at that time the people in number were few in the world and they had to they were in one place one area one timezone and so God could designate to Israel one day as a day of rest but of course with natural argumentation we understand that the world is now many many time zones and when it's that Saturday or the Sabbath day or whatever on a certain part of the world then it's not in several other parts and that will create a form of confusion but that's just normal natural argument but what does the Bible say about it the Bible tells us that he that is entered into his rest he who was entered into his rest or the rest that Jesus Christ gives it's not a date but it is an eternal rest in which God is giving us an eternal Sabbath in other words we understand that the seventh day is but a type of the eternal Sabbath for sin with my friends is a number of completion it is the number of a new beginning so 7 or Saturday or the Sabbath day that was given to the Jews is a symbol of completion it a type of Sunday type of the resurrection is a symbol of a new week a new beginning it's a new beginning so but days have their significance in the natural no so we see God could not give us any certain one day in a natural week as a day of rest but when we remain until you come into his rest we enter that rest we remain in that rest now Israel of course that work were able to enter into but could not remain in that rest because that day will be passive if it's one day that they will be pass and then they go back into restlessness and they have to wait for another week and then they go back into arrest and then they go back into restlessness because that was a one day affair they had back there but Jesus is saying that he who has the Bible is saying who he who enters into this rest has ceased from his labors he would ever have to go back out and be restless a wandering soul a tryst would on the tides of time but one was entered into the rest of the Living God and there he has entered as the Sun rises I have entered the Amen of rest I sailed a white seas no more for Jesus is a rest may God help every one of us today to enter into God's eternal rest and to rest in his love his care praise God hallelujah amen no we don't want to go backwards for that seven-day that was given to Israel was a shadow a type a pre figure of the substance reality that was to come but I'm afraid that many of my beloved brethren are crying and went backwards they went back and holding on to the shadow they're holding on to the substitute instead of reaching out and taking a hold of the reality of the substance of the manifestation of the Word of God and the application of the truth of the word of God to our day and to our age and time that God hath given unto us now what a blessed singing this my beloved brethren for us to be like this great Apostle John who the Bible said God the Lord Jesus loved John the Apostle and about two or three times we read in the Gospels he who Jesus loved John he who Jesus loved and one time it says and that disciple that lay upon Jesus bosom whose name was John or what a place for everyone to come and enter into this believers rest where we can rest our case or problem rester situation rest their trials rest our Technic lights our mental anguish our pain or depression or oppression if we can enter into that rest and rest our heads upon Jesus breast or bosom not that presence bosom but rest in Jesus bosom rest in his care rest in the shadow of this great wings let him watch over us I will not leave you comfortless he said but I'll be with you I'll be even in you to the very end of the age and in that day they will know that I and the father are one and that I am in you you and me and together we are one amen the oneness of God in His people how blessed how wonderful to know that as the tea cup of water from the ocean has the same properties as the water in the ocean itself praise God we may be human but the soul that is in us never dies and is apart from the great oceans of God and we come from God like the tides of the sea and we got back to contour original position how happy we should be brother sister that we can come for a place of rest and Christ and know that we are one in him this would be the name of the Lord amen so we know friends it is not the keeping of any day not Saturday nor Sunday and no matter I want to tell you this is an eternal rest for the rest my friends is that blessed Holy Spirit of God's Sabbath within your soul let me say to you it doesn't matter how long you have been laboring under your habits under your sin under your problem under your situation whether it is 10 years 30 years 50 years or even longer Jesus is saying come come you weary cut all of you that are troubled thus that those are the scarred those are the pros he's saying come and I will give you life I will give you rest if you come to me you will find rest Jesus said in the Gospels rest for your soul you will find rest in him the true Sabbath in other words is he himself for he said I will give you rest Jesus you is your rest Christ in you your hope of glory that is your rest know you'll see the meat brothers brother Simon what is that rest that Jesus will give what is that rest now in Isaiah 28 8 to 12 please listen excuse me we find that in the Word of God that he said here in Isaiah the tables are full of vomit even some of the groups the churches are all messed up in other words and sometimes even in the building even in the community called the church a person may not be able to find rest there no clean place whom shall I teach knowledge whom shall be he made to understand the doctrine then other wind from milk and drawn away from breasts for precept must be upon precept line upon line here a little they were written for mr. manleigh and with another term will I speak to his people to whom I said this is the rest this is the Sabbath where would you make caused the people to rest or keep the truth Sabbath this is the refreshing yet they will not hear that would understand so here it is prophesied in Isaiah that the Holy Spirit coming into a life refreshing it invigorating it anointing it bring you to a big place of peace and a place of rest that he is the risk in our souls the true Sabbath of course is the person of Jesus Christ now in the form of the Holy Spirit God residing and resting within the human soul praise God for the Bible tells us chapter 2 McMahon when they were filled with the Holy Ghost the Apostles cease from their worldly works this cease from their worldly doings this cease from any evil ways that they had and the Holy Ghost took charge her their lives and they became the sports and I am a prisoner of Jesus Christ because Herod ills that they surrendered their lines to him they rested in him and he did the acts are the works through them praise God hallelujah they entered into his rest there is the rest according to the Word of God there is the rest you need and I need according to this Bible that is the Sabbath we should put our faith and trust in Jesus Christ himself it's not a spirit of the Living God amen it is you ceasing from your works your fleshly endeavors and to rest in the achievements and the overcoming of Jesus Christ himself and what God is doing and willing and acting and working through you for it is god that's working in you to do of his good pleasure and of his good will praise be to God hallelujah amen praise God now we understand that persons who worship on Saturday my friends claim that we meet on the wrong day of the week which is Sunday they believe that that's the wrong day of the week and that they are worshiping in the right day of the week now I'm not saying anything against anyone that wants the wash of God on Saturday that's you can wash it bottom anything that you wish to worship him but don't impress on anyone that Saturday is that day of rest and is the rest of God for it is not the rest is the Holy Spirit of the Living God and we want to rest on that the Saturday is not the rest spoken off we find that that Justin Martyr in the second century said on Sunday a meeting is held that they repeat he said on Sunday a meeting is held of all who live in the cities villages we read the memoirs of the Apostles and their writings as long as time permits when the reading is finished an exhortation is given to imitate those noble things after this we authorize and offer common prayer in the presence of God then the congregation says Amen after this the elements of distributed bread and the wine we partake of that and then those that are upset the Deacons go to their homes and serve them that Lord's Supper and the wealthy then give gifts every one of us we receive a collection freewill and it's deposited later distributed to orphans widows prisoners and strangers and those that are in need praise God so we see even in the Apostles past aaalac times or even slightly after the Apostles they did not keep the Jewish or Judaic tradition of assembling on the last day of the week but instead they were meeting on the first day of the week and it's not that they were grossly ignorant because there were many many of them most of them were mainly Jews they were not ignorant they were well aware but they recognized there was a from law to grace there was a change that we are not on the law but we are under grace that was to the Jews now this in our day is to the Gentiles neither Saturday nor Sunday but to enter into the rest by being in filled by the Blessed Holy Spirit who comes to rest as the dove of peace within our souls and we in turn rest in him our peace hallelujah for years our peace and he has broken down every wall praise God hallelujah every wall between us and God he is broken on every wall and giving us rest and peace within our souls oh that person's may come or that you may come to him my friend and find rest in him for there is a thirst there is a craving within the hearts of men but the majority my friends don't know the answer and so to steal their conscience to suppress their hunger they they and their hearts that is trying out for the conscience is speaking to them and crying out and they want to death that they want to dull the cry their hearts cry and the crave their soul so they give up my friends go into drinking they going to smoking they're going to carouse and partying busying themselves with business running to and fro and all of this activity is trying to shake off the voice of their conscience that's so let's speaking to them and telling them to to cease their human labor and find a place of rest in Jesus Christ all my friends they grew up there and tried to engage physical excess of sensuality promiscuity lying stealing backbiting and such things and ends up there is not in arrest there is no rest there is no peace until you let the Lord Jesus Christ come in and give you his glorious remedy the remedy is not smoking the remedy is not pills sleeping pills the remedy is not drugs it's none of those things their remedy with is given to you by the great physician Jesus Christ himself who said the Scriptures are there is a balm in Gilead that makes the woman spirit all jesus said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest would you come to him now and let him give you rest and peace within your souls there is no rest from earthly pills or potions or or any medicines or capsule loser or vitamins my friends the rest comes from Jesus Christ and Christ alone what the world needs today above all else is Jesus Christ hallelujah they need God's heavenly remedy of the rest of the Holy Spirit all glory be to God very friends then we find the other group that insists you must go to church on Sunday one group in systems go on Saturday the seventh day one insist you must go on Sunday you know the day or the first day again of the week see but Jesus said me neither they don't know how to approach God because the real approach to God is not here it's not it's not on this day it's not on that day but the rest is in Christ hallelujah the true worship is the worship God we're in spirit and in truth hallelujah oh praise God John 4:24 friends tells us get that kind of worship you only find it in Jesus Christ hallelujah amen oh praise God how can you find rest someone to a church how could you find rest just in the church not to say the church is a is an aid the church is a community that can give you spiritual comfort and social support a social blanket a community of faith but friends the kind of church I'm talking about how can you find rest and peace in a church that will tell you you know God allows them to put up Santa Claus in the church God allows them to put up Tenenbaum the Christmas trees in the church God allows them at Easter to have bunnies and eggs in the church how can you find peace in the place like that it is not in the Bible it is not found within the Word of God that is painted worship that is speaking teaching it comes from the paganism and Christianity as paganism into Christianity or paganism has blended itself to deceive within the ranks of Christianity and many have find themselves entangled in its veins come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins leave that harlot and come to the one grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ when one turns to the Lord one can find my friends the infilling of the Holy Spirit and then you can cease from your officially working up yourself struggling striving being tossed about not knowing what life is about not finding any purpose then when you come to him you'll find rest in your soul find your real purpose you'll really begin to live and to love God and to worship Him in spirit and in truth now let us recap briefly my friends let's get back here and see what God's Word says we know then in our final conclusion here that the Lord's Day is not Saturday nor is the Lord's Day Sunday you say well what is it my friends today is not the lord's day it's not the Lord's age we are now living in the age of man or the time of man or or man's day or the day where men controls on the earth everything it's a day of man's works man science men trying to achieve men trying to build another Tower of Babel again man's doing this man's working man's church not God's church but it's man building up their vision their idea of what God's church should look like instead of going back to acts 2 and seeing God's original blueprint and pattern and build on work according to God's commands and God's blueprint that he has laid in his word Oh blessed be his name but God's blueprint breath since strange to men today it doesn't seem so ordered systematic theologies and systematize they say they don't see it that way they have to have what they think is his proper administration's orders and things all lined up like that and I love themselves to be clearly being able to attract TRACON and being able to be anticipated their every action by no by Satan when the Bible says the sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God and the wind blows where it lists and no man need those miracles it seems as if there is no order in the way the wind moves or the Holy Spirit moves but God knows his own doings and his own ways and his own orders as the scripture of the songwriter said our God moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform he plans his footsteps on the sea and he rides upon the storm oh what a blessing blessing what a complaining God we serve something no it's a day of man's ideas about everything man's works man's everything man's idea of how we should worship God when God has plainly given us in his work no matter how beautiful your worship how wonderful it sounds if you're not in the spirit it's a Kanis watch it though can had every beautiful thing on that altar Cain was religious he was crying of all God God of course is an object of worship that's not the name of anybody but it will have a revelation and you who he watch it let's come back to the Word of God and never recognition and a revelation of who we truly worship may God help every one of us today but thank God when men's Day is over that day the Lord is coming I said gods day is coming that's the great day of the Lord when man's day is over and this world will become the this world will come on the Dominion of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the King of Kings and the Lord of lords who will rule over all things for the kingdoms of this world will become the kingdoms of our God and when the day of the Lord comes then judgments will begin to fall judgments everywhere and after the judgment my friends then we will enter those who are his chosen ones will enter into what is called the glorious millennial period we will enter into the Millennium praise God hallelujah but right now the world loves to make trouble for the Christians the world loves to persecute Christians the world loves to make fun of Christians torment accused Christians make snide remarks upon the believers who truly believe the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they call him our Lord by evil swear words and evil names and everything else and make fun of him our Lord and of his people but there is coming a great and notable day of the Lord what then what then when the great book of God is open what then when the names of those that have to be just my friends what then what will you do then the day of the Lord is coming o friends come on there is yet time to come we understand that this multiple day is coming where there will be wailing weeping and howling for the wrath of the Lamb will be upon us the wrath of the Lamb will be upon the world judgments will fall and he that land will become the judge amen and the wicked shall burn be burnt up amen hallelujah praise God hallelujah there will be burnt up and according to Malachi chapter 4 verse 3 and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet and that me I shall do this say it the Lord now friends that's the day when job chapter 3 verses 13 and verses 16 to 19 will come to pass let me conclude by reading lists hallelujah amen Loreena his wonderful name for now should I have lain still and be quiet I should have slept then would I be at rest praise God listen or as a hit untimely birth by Aetna Dean as infants which never saw the light for there the wicked shall cease from troubling or tormenting the true believer for there the wicked shall cease from troubling and there the weary shall be at rest hallelujah then all the prisoners will rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor no more and the smaller the greater their and the servant is then free from his master oh praise God the day the Lord is coming when the when the wicked shall cease from troubling the wicked shall cease from their accuser since their lies and all of their troubling their rumors that they've been against the believer and their job says there shall the believer find rest rest in Christ hallelujah no more crying no more weeping no more sorrow for all that has passed away god bless you my friends come to him give your life to Him and may he begin to take your sins your sorrows your troubles your trials or depressions your oppressions your darkness the darkness that's in the coverings of your soul and
