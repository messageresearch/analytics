happy to be here tonight in god's house and to gather in his marvelous wonderful name of course it's in the middle of the week and you're going to be going back to work so let's get into the word of god uh feed upon it recharge your batteries and uh quicken your life and go back to what you have to do so that will come back on the lord's day together with all of god's people giving praise honor and glory to his marvelous and wonderful name praise god thank you so much thank you god bless you amen uh our scripture will be found in genesis 1 verse 11. our our lesson for tonight is the original seed life the original seed life genesis 1 11. and our scripture reads and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so praise god our gracious heavenly father we are so thankful for every individual soul that is represented here upon this earth in this mortal realm and physically they stand before me as i stand before them spirit with spirit will meet god's spirit with our spirit and together fellowshipping with thee under the divine inspiration of the word of god we pray that your holy presence will draw us together draw our minds and thoughts away from the toils of the road and lord the various distractions that will come into our lives we pray now just for a few moments time lord of time that you will just bring us into your word that we might see thy glorious light and give you praise and honor and glory for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and amen the lord bless you please be seated now we know of course that god in before the foundations of the world god wanted to uh plant or place his sea life on this earth right we see that in all the parables that he spoke about the sower and the seed really which was god speaking about himself and what he wanted to do and what he did and how satan corrupted the entire way and so god wanted to plant his seed upon the earth the seed of his life upon the earth and that life should have traveled through adam through eve and then it should have multiplied itself throughout the entire earth and that is why that even after they sinned uh before they sin and after he says go and multiply right before go multiply and replenish the earth now watch the word replenish because there's a little topic there but we won't go to that now uh praise god here it is friends and so god's seed life came on the earth but then you know the great war the battle that was going on in heaven how lucifer at that time he wasn't called satan the devil the old dragon the old serpent he wasn't called those names but these names reflect his character and so he was the light bearer lucifer the one who was there leading the rest of the angels but then he started to raise up himself and say i will lift myself up i'll be greater than god and i'll do this and i'll do that and we know the rest of the story how through his scheming through his lies through his rumors he created a lot of problems in the heavenlies and war really started in the heavenlies and so then uh the war dropped from the heavens and came down to earth man god's creation became the focus of his anger his hatred right so he wants to get a hold of man who is supposed to be god's crowning creation to this day he's trying to make a better man better woman better everything he's trying to do that and so he defiled eve the bible used the word beguile but you look at it defiled eve and so by defiling eve or planting his seed now god to reverse that had to have his seed life planted also and so that is why you will find out in the bible that eve actually bore twins she bore twins and one called kane and the other able not to go around go over that entire story but just to give you a background to where where i'm going here and twins but just as it was in the heavens the one was fighting against god it dropped on the earth so he acted exactly like his father and he fought against abel who was the direct descendant of adam and so they had this battle amongst themselves in the same womb and yet one of god and one of the devil very symbolic you can have a whole church one of god one of the devil i'll take one and i leave one god said that in his word all right so then we find out friends that whoever is of satan's lies that is their origin that will be the motivating factor of their character that will be the thing that inspires and moves them but a bell being from god the seed life of god in him would cause him to have the character uh and the nature like the lord god himself had therefore if we claim that we are sons and daughters of god how can we reject the word of god which the bible says the word is god right so then we find out that if a person claims that they're a christian they claim that they are a believer and turn around and deny the word of god then we know that the spirit that is in them that spirit that is in them is absolutely a hypocrite for its claiming to be a child of god out from the seed life of god which is the word of god and turn around and deny the same word it's impossible it cannot do that it proves right there it's a hypocrite look it's like you take a mule i have to chuckle because i'm thinking of it now and the mule comes if he could talk and tells you i am a sorrow bred horse of course because he is saying something that he really is not it's not just nature he he his nature is to be stubborn his nature is to act like a real brute that is his nature uh he'll go every year he'll just fight against everything that you try to tell him he'll bite yell he'll he'll stomp he'll kick he'll do everything else right but he's claiming that he's a horse then if you kind of put him in a corner and say well you can't be a horse because man you can't even beat that cult over there that young believer that that's there you can't even deal with them so well i'm not really uh you know i was just making a joke i'm not really a horse i'm a donkey well you see he's still lying he's still a hypocrite he's neither one he's a bastard born he's illegitimate and he's against the word of god because the word of god is clear that if you are a part of him you can't reject him you will obey his word because you are part of that word you are part of that life and then for you to reject that is to reject yourself to reject your origins and everything else like that amen praise god and so therefore that is why we see jesus christ was the perfect manifestation of god himself that is why he is called the word for all of god's word god's thoughts god's expressions god's motives and intentions were all in him he was the sum total of it there is nothing more to be added to him or taken away from him no glory can be diminished none whatsoever he stands as the eternal word of god amen he cannot change for that's who he is amen yes sir no satan gave eve a seed but god also gave her a seed and gods gave her that seed so it could comfort conquer and correct these uh thoughts that satan would begin to spew in the world the chaos and the confusion that he would begin to create in the world god made sure that his seed will bruise the serpent's head and that is what i'm talking about he will uh he will conquer satan conquer his works conquer his thoughts conquer every suggestion that comes from him and overcome him and correct every spirit that is in the church of the living god the true church of the living god amen you see god had to do that that way because if his plan was corrupted and obstructed by satan working through a woman then he had to correct it again through a woman is that right so we know that uh in the beginning he did it in a minor form through eve herself by abel coming on the scene but that was foreshadowing the lord jesus christ himself coming through a woman amen a prepared vessel for the hour that god's purpose plan will be fulfilled and the curse will now begin to be reversed amen and so here we find my friends that god moved in such a way one disbelieved his word and disobeyed his word and caused the whole entire world creation to go into chaos confusion and what we say sin evil on every hand but the other uh one my friends that came later she believed god mary believed god she believed god's word hallelujah praise god now you always remember uh in the scriptures a woman is symbolic of the church symbolic of the church it can be symbolic of a false church or of the true church of course jezebel delilah some characters like that are you know symbolic of the false church and people like sarah ruth uh mary they would be symbolic of the true church so here we find out god is showing one took it away and i'm bringing it back by another and here it is we see that god so women you have your place you are blessed by god god placed you here for purpose he placed man on the earth as men for his own purpose to fulfill his word and god bless you amen in every way praise god hallelujah oh my praise god and take my words what i'm saying it doesn't matter whether the woman is a ceo or whether she's a housewife hey man she is a woman that god placed here amen and god placed them here so that they can be vessels for him to fulfill his word amen thank god hallelujah praise his marvelous and wonderful name praise god now god in the beginning all of his children would have been the same i don't mean same in looks and that way but they would have been of the same nature and the same character and that character would have been the word of god in them that is their character that they would have had but satan by his sawing of the seed of discrepancy now he created chaos right created chaos i've told the story over and over how when i was younger i i had this whether you call it vision or dream whatever of a hand with a white coming with a bag of uh coming coming out like that and dropped one coin and i looked at the coin as i bent over to pick it up another hand came out of the heavens filled with a bag of coins and dropped them around the first one and if i did not keep my eye on the original one i would be confused because they all look the same is that right that's what i'm talking about satan create complete confusion on the earth where people are wondering oh is this the word is that the word is it is is that what's preached over there is a word that people are in absolute total confusion and as jesus said it's gonna wax worse and it's waxing worse in sin in everything is waxing worse in unbelief because more and more confusion is being sowed in the earth and men are so confused that we find out they're going insane and don't know it they're going over their mind well insane in sin it's not too far apart so you just put that together and you'll understand see but it's going in that direction right now brothers and sisters confusion everywhere on the earth hallelujah and god's children amen should like i said be of the same character now back then we understand that god wanted to actually speak his children into existence just like he spoke adam into existence molded the body part and then spoke breathe the life in him god wanted to do it that way and the plan got up uh upended but he returned back to his plan like i said he placed mary there in history down the line so that the gods of this world or the evil one would be confused he didn't know what was coming he didn't know there was a plan of redemption he didn't know what god had in his mind so god carried out his plans and then we find out that uh god now is able through jesus christ coming on the scene to bring a new creation my father were credited to and now i work so here a new creation by what this spoken word of god the spoken word of god restoring back god's original life right by his spoken word so we find out that uh pause here for a moment jesus is the word all all of the word but what he typified on the day of pentecost with a pillar of fire breaking into small pieces was that god was now kind of placing himself into men and women that would believe his word and allow him to live in them dwell in them walk in them be their god and they are his people and he's living in them right on the earth his name shall be called emmanuel that's not just jesus back there but that is the living epistles of this hour when the spirit of christ strikes your heart lives within your being and moves you amen praise god i'm not talking about moving around with your nose stuck up in the air i'm a christian and walking around with uh religious pride uh that you're a somebody but in the humility of the spirit amen in the reverence of the holy spirit praise the name of the lord hallelujah amen so the sons and daughters of god when we say they are born again they are born by his spoken word how shall they hear unless the preacher is sent see the preacher speaks the word and when he speaks the word which is god's seed life amen you receive that word of god within your heart and when you receive that word you believe it receive the word of god within your heart then you are impregnated by the word of god and by the spirit of god to bring forth the life of god amen oh praises marvelous and wonderful name amen now we know that if eve had stayed within god's original plan she would have brought forth the true word child in other words mary would not have had to be down the line jesus would have come way up there but because it was up ended here then you had to have this plan where later uh mary had to be down the line amen because remember god that was um that was god's intention because he'd already told her multiply and replenish the earth right so that he showed his intention was to do that and he was to do it by his word amen praise god so god's children are really his word made manifest the spoken word in a human life made manifest now you may not be conscious that you're a part of that word but you will find some things i'm speaking now humanly speaking um there's certain things you just can't do and you don't know why for myself i knew when i was just a boy at school and we'll be fighting and things like that and back in those days i don't laugh but we used to have slates and we'd have to write on the slate and then some guys would get mad break the slate and just whack hit somebody on the head cut them or cut into some of their body or something like that and for the life of me why can't i be like vicious like these other guys why can't i be a real man but something was holding me on the inside but i don't know what it was i could only go so far and no further and therefore you that made me be like a little loner so that kind of oh wait you see but my god we find out that god's children are not mixed up like the mule and then exactly who they are once he makes them conscious of who they are because you can be around in the world living the life of the world having a great time but god will one day stop you in your tracks and make you conscious of who you really are is that right yes your human being physically but on the inside there's a man inside there paul said this outward man may die get old go to the grave but the inward man is being renewed daily daily the word man is being renewed amen glory unto glory unto glory until one day it goes back to the glory from whence it came so here we find out that we are not mules we are god's sons and daughters because a mule doesn't even know who his daddy is he doesn't really know who his father is you find out that just being a church member they don't even know who god is they just say god and well god is just an object of worship which god are you talking about uh what are you talking about god just means object of worship right okay but god's children who they are who who their father is right oh my say well my father is god the father my father is god the son no i was born again by the holy spirit they've gone into that confusion the devil created that but we know that the bible tells us plainly hero israel the lord thy god is one one lord they're not two gods there's no tree gods amen once the devil can shift you off from god's word which is one god and he shifts you to believing too and gets you three then he might as well he can get you to believe a million he can get you to believe in thousands of god god for the weather god for for traveling god for sickness god for hunger god for pain a god for this and a god for that he can do all that and get you to believe that but the bible doesn't change it remains the same hero israel the lord thy god is one oh lord says marvelous and wonderful name so he doesn't even know who his daddy is but we know who our daddy is is that right that is why i'm named simon and that is why your name your family name and that is why we are called christians amen praise god we are not this we're not that we're not not denominationalists we're not a baptist we're not a methodist we're not the wonderful people but not understanding clearly the word of god amen amen praise god hallelujah amen praise god say oh but i'm a christian just like you that's wonderful and uh i'll speak with you i'll deal with you such praise god because we don't know who is who is that right why because you'll find out you can be in the same field but not of the same fold is that right what i'm thinking of is like you you get pigs and sheep feeding together in a field it doesn't make the pig turn into a sheep because he's in the same church they're all in the same church feeding on the same wheat that's left in the field feeding on the same word of god but it will never change that pig into a sheep the sheep had to be a sheep to begin with and you did not become a christian on a certain day you did not become a son of god on a certain day you had to have the same eternal quality that is in god himself why because god's eternal and every seed shall bring forth after its kind that is his own principle and if you are his seed his children then you have got to have that spark of eternal life in you and come to the earth with it in you already and all you need is an awakening to recognize your day your train the message of the hour of god i'll speak to your soul amen recognize your day in the message of your day hallelujah amen praise god you know because the the mule is not the torah bread to begin with he doesn't even know his pedigree he doesn't know his spiritual ancestry as far as it goes back but the true child of god knows their ancestry we come from god and we're going back to god is that right hallelujah we are not creatures of time we are creatures from eternity you come from eternity you're going back to eternity hallelujah amen god calls you children of god people don't understand the vastness of that statement he's telling you you're a chip off the old block or the old rock if you want to put it that way you see we come with his qualities in us but it takes the holy spirit the word to and the word to quicken us to who we are amen and that we have the ability to live up to our father's expectations amen praise god hallelujah so god in other words he used a woman in the beginning he was a woman in the middle of the bible god was showing he wants to use a church or the church to manifest himself to manifest his sons and his daughters to manifest his children bring them on the scene and let them live the way he wants them to live not to be a snake a crab or a toad that was caused jesus said a man cast a net into the sea and when he pulled it in it had all kinds of denizens of the deep inside of it you pulled them in and when he pulled them in um crab snake this that in there but the fact because they're in a net with rainbow trout or tilapia or whatever was in that net doesn't turn them by being in the church being in the confines of a church being religious doesn't turn them into a son or a daughter of the living god amen hallelujah amen praise god i'm glad that the son of god is identified by god himself manifesting himself through that son or daughter of god is that right now you just go back to the gospels and watch that thought in jesus christ himself he didn't what did he have to prove he didn't have to really prove anything because his whole walk his whole life was a manifestation of god working through him and making himself manifest through him and that identified him if the people wanted to see it identified him amen praise god and they were telling lies because uh they said we we are abraham's seed europeans above the devil and jesus just calmly turned to them said see you're of your father the devil in other words you're referring back to the beginning because he was there he knows everything so he says you're of your father the devil he's a liar to begin with and a murderer to begin with because abraham rejoiced which means abraham had a vision back there to see my day is that right see why he's the father of the faithful and he rejoiced it was so compelling to him it caused him to rejoice oh praise god and now you claim that you are sons children of abraham but you don't really have abraham said because you don't act like abraham you don't react to the word of god like abraham would have abraham rejoice to see my day rejoice to see the word coming right but but but you want to kill the world you want to take is bear false witness against the word you want to call him every other name except the word of god amen yes sir hallelujah so how can you be uh abraham's children amen uh they said hush up we don't need anybody to teach us the same spirit of the devil you know he thinks he already knows so god isn't gonna teach him anything whatsoever like that but you know this is all going to come to an end and it's going to wind up in the lake of fire amen just to think of it this uh world filled with spiritually illegitimate children claiming to be children of god or professing to be children of god amen jesus was so plain said you are of your father the devil and his works you will do exactly what works what works he's saying you'll do exactly what your father did now i want to bring a thought here see what did the devil do he high breeded you know the devil is into high breeding that's what he did he high breeded right when eve should have brought forth a pure sun she was hybrid and there that principle by breathing is brought down right through the jewish age right to this to the church age right mixing creeds and catechisms whatever else fundamentals whatever and using the mixing it hybriding because it's mixed in with the word of god but it's not the pure word of god it's not the true word of god watch what it produces what's coming out of it proves and shows what it is amen absolutely and i want to thank god that jesus came and died for us hallelujah that is why he said except the corn of wheat fall into the ground it will abide alone but if it goes into the ground it will come back up and then it will produce itself again a thousand-fold he was just speaking of the resurrection his deathbed and resurrection to come and that's what his life would do so that when he went to the cross and said he gave up the ghost hallelujah which i believe to be the holy ghost he gave up the ghost hallelujah three days and then he came that's it was jesus christ but the spirit that was in him now it's the same person it's not another person but he came back in the form of the holy ghost amen and then now now to this day he's available for all true believers it's not whether i tell you that you're a believer even if you were in this church for 40 years it's when he witnesses to your heart that you are a believer you know that you're a believer for yourself you have that conviction praise god hallelujah it's not my trying to persuade you it's not my trying to uh bring forth religious propaganda or or trying to sway you this we are that way no but it's you recognizing who you are it's you looking in the mirror of the word of god hallelujah and saying by god that's me amen that's me oh it's talking about me praise god why because that's the way god works hallelujah amen praise his name hallelujah and that's why the book of revelation tells us come out of her my people be not partakers of our plagues so that i have to judge you along with her and with the things that she is doing but back to the start he being the original seed he said i've got to be planted in the ground so that i can come back up manifest is that right wow he's talking oh this is wonderful marvelous brother danny talking about uh uh adam slept fella was put to sleep in the garden and then a wife taken from his side you know a ribbon around that you know then the scriptures speak of it he goes to sleep speak spiritually speaking on the cross and from his side blood and water comes out amen praise god and our life comes from his blood not the chemical that fell on the ground red but the life was in the blood hallelujah and when the blood came out it was a symbol for our eyes because our senses wouldn't pick up a spirit leaving him but he says the life came out his life came out and that life is now in this world available for every single one of us that can and would believe the word of god hallelujah amen you say well brother simon i'm i know i'm a believer i i am positive i'm a believer i believe i'm a christian a real christian that amen that may be good but the word of god has to identify you and will show you who you really are just like it said i believe it was abel that by faith abel knew what sacrifice to put on that altar amen why didn't he go and offer a fish why didn't he go offer up some uh you know a snake why didn't he go off a bird or something like that but it was revealed to him to put a lamb on that altar hallelujah but he could have put anything he wanted if he did not have a revelation but he did it by revelation that's why god's church jesus said is founded on revelation right and then oh praise god it says and then god testified of his gifts the fire came from heaven and burnt the sacrifice up proving it's not a balance gonna prove now it's god proving that abel was right abel's revelation was right hallelujah praise god so it doesn't even my talking here is the holy spirit will prove whether this is right praise god hallelujah amen glory to god of course you know the principle you reap what you sow is that right just imagine that you want to have limes and you go plant cucumbers you're planting cucumbers every seed must bring forth after its kind it's going to produce cucumbers not limes and if you were to tell people that they're going to think that that guy's he kind of losing something is getting uh empty up there as the west indians would say cockroach went into his ears and cut out his brains right so here it is you reap what you saw and if you plant cucumbers you're going to get cucumbers you can't get anything else because that's what it is you say well uh brother simon i don't know what you're talking about this is a different day that we're living in uh uh today but you know uh i read it some time ago i believe it was in time magazine many years ago that the the garners where joseph uh the pharaoh's tomb wasn't garner uh some of the wheat that was in the uh patriarch joseph's day was found in the pharaohs tomb thousands of years in the tomb they thought it was all dead but they decided to put it on some uh on blotting paper moist with water under it to cause it to see if it has any life to their surprise it brought forth a crop i'm not you know it's germinated and they were able to take it and uh create a crop from the wheat seeds that were sitting in there for thousands of years what i'm saying is thousands of years these wheat seed didn't change they didn't become some other seed it didn't become something else let me have a revised version of the seed here let me have the authorized version of the seed let me have this version that version no it's it's wonderful that man thinks like that but god's word does not change so let every man's word be a liar and my word be true because i'm god i can't change i can't lie i won't do these things your word remains the same amen but you see the houses change the dressing change the style change and then we try to change the word of god to suit that we want to make the word of god suit the changes civilization and society and culture brought along but we can't change the world because the word itself is god amen not speaking only of the written representation amen here we know it's the bible but god is a spirit right he can't change praise god so there we find out that women will want to start acting like men yeah right uh just yesterday i saw one return great big um heavy steel toe boots walking like that and you know talking like that and then i turned on the tv last night to um hear some of the um news that was on yesterday and later on there my back was turned i was doing something else and somebody was talking there and everything else and i turned her and it was a man a pure if my back stayed turned i would think that that was a woman but when i turned around and look it was a man what i'm saying is the seeds on this earth are all hybrid it's so mixed up on everything else that's naturally speaking and saying that to reflect spiritually speaking that's exactly also what is really happening upon the face of the world amen thank god as it's written on the wall behind jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever hebrews 13 8 amen he doesn't change the word does not change praise the lord uh i'll wrap things up here now praise the lord because we can go on talking like this and i can keep you until midnight and then you fall over but i may not be able to raise you up like paul did i have here and i'm going to quote it again let every man's word be a lie and mine be the truth thank god i believe that we all need to come back and be rooted and grounded securely in god's word alone so that we can manifest and bring forth god's life the life of god in this modern wicked chaotic age that we're living in like daniel we can still live godly in the midst of babylon god bless you god bless you our gracious father we thank you for thy word that was sent forth as the musicians come lord a blessed father every heart every life every person here and may you receive all the praise the honor and the glory for we ask it in no other name but in the wonderful glorious name of our lord jesus christ
