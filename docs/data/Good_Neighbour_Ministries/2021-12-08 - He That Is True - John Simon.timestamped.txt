[0:14] welcome friends
[0:16] it's so good to be back in the presence
[0:19] of the lord
[0:21] and to share with you
[0:23] the wonderful things of god
[0:26] certainly with joy
[0:29] let us together draw water
[0:33] fresh water
[0:34] from the wells of salvation
[0:37] may the holy spirit be with us
[0:40] and bless us
[0:42] in every possible way
[0:46] our scripture for today
[0:48] is found in the book of revelation
[0:51] chapter 3
[0:53] reading verse 7
[0:56] and
[0:57] to the angel of the church
[1:00] in philadelphia write
[1:03] these things saith he
[1:06] that is holy
[1:09] that is true
[1:11] he that had the key of david
[1:14] he that opened it
[1:16] and no man shut it
[1:19] and shut it
[1:21] and no man
[1:23] open it
[1:24] thank god for his wonderful words of
[1:28] life
[1:29] let us pray
[1:31] our gracious
[1:33] loving
[1:34] and eternal heavenly father
[1:37] thou great eternal being
[1:41] that inhabits all eternity and every
[1:44] living thing
[1:46] we praise and magnify your great and
[1:50] holy name
[1:52] may the spirit of almighty god
[1:55] from you so anoint me that i may speak
[1:58] thy word lord freely
[2:01] with the great oils of the holy spirit
[2:05] to thee be the praise the honor and the
[2:08] glory we are here to glorify your name
[2:12] and to magnify it together both speaker
[2:16] and hearers
[2:17] oh god grant those who have faith that
[2:22] their faith may grow and increase
[2:25] and to those father who are not aware
[2:29] that they have this faith
[2:31] may you

[2:37] them
[2:38] pour upon it the waters of life
[2:41] bring it into germination and into
[2:43] manifestation for your glory and honor
[2:46] this day we ask it
[2:48] in the name of jesus christ with
[2:51] thankful hearts
[2:53] amen
[2:54] and amen
[2:57] here we are today
[3:00] and this is another study
[3:04] in the church age series
[3:07] we are now
[3:09] at the sixth church age
[3:12] better known as
[3:14] the philadelphian
[3:16] church age
[3:19] how beautiful
[3:21] were the words of our text that we just
[3:24] read
[3:25] how majestic
[3:27] are the declarations of scripture
[3:31] it speaks of
[3:33] several attributes
[3:36] he that is holy
[3:38] he that is true
[3:41] he that had the key of david
[3:44] think of it all these wonderful
[3:48] attributes
[3:50] are applied to one person
[3:54] hallelujah
[3:56] my friends
[3:58] one person
[4:00] and we know that one person is jesus
[4:05] christ our lord
[4:07] jesus christ the lord of glory
[4:11] the one who came to earth
[4:14] this one with an ever living story to
[4:17] yesterday today and forever
[4:21] glory to his name
[4:23] now
[4:24] the key to interpreting
[4:28] these wonderful descriptive phrases
[4:32] that speaks
[4:34] of jesus christ
[4:36] himself
[4:38] will find
[4:40] some help in verse 9
[4:43] of revelation
[4:45] chapter 3
[4:47] says here behold
[4:50] i will make them of the synagogue of
[4:53] satan
[4:54] which
[4:55] or who
[4:56] say they are jews
[5:00] and are not
[5:04] but do lie
[5:06] behold i will make them come and worship
[5:10] before thy feet
[5:12] and to know
[5:14] that i have loved thee
[5:16] of course this
[5:18] refers uh particularly to jesus christ
[5:22] and all the believers
[5:24] that are a part of him also that are
[5:28] mock that are scuffed at in our day and
[5:30] in our time god says at the end of this
[5:33] all i will make them to fall down before
[5:38] thee and to
[5:40] wash it before thy feet i will not touch
[5:43] on that because to worship means you're
[5:45] a part of him that's the reason why
[5:48] they'll have to fall down before you and
[5:50] recognize your bridehood part of you in
[5:54] christ hallelujah blessed be the name of
[5:57] the lord amen
[5:59] now
[6:00] this is speaking
[6:02] about how the jews
[6:05] look upon themselves and call themselves
[6:08] children of god
[6:10] but when they do that
[6:13] they do that in exclusion to everybody
[6:17] else
[6:19] yep they're the ones that crucified and
[6:22] killed the lord jesus christ
[6:26] the this terrible deed
[6:29] brought their own blood
[6:32] upon their own heads for centuries
[6:36] all because
[6:39] they refused and still refuse
[6:43] jesus christ as their messiah
[6:47] the jehovah of the old testament
[6:51] manifested in flesh
[6:54] given an earthly name jesus
[6:58] that he might become
[7:00] familiar and unknown of men
[7:04] my friends here it is
[7:08] to them
[7:10] they called him
[7:11] beelzebub
[7:14] in other words they called them someone
[7:16] unrighteous
[7:18] unfit
[7:20] to fill this marvelous role
[7:24] that they had in their hearts
[7:27] but indeed the scriptures declared to us
[7:31] he was
[7:33] emmanuel
[7:35] he was
[7:37] the word made flesh
[7:39] he was
[7:41] their messiah that they were waiting for
[7:46] but they did not recognize
[7:49] their day
[7:51] nor the fulfillment of scripture
[7:54] in their day
[7:56] and in their hour
[7:59] he was god manifested in the flesh
[8:02] he was the messiah come to earth jesus
[8:06] christ the mighty ever living
[8:09] one
[8:10] amen and now
[8:13] here he is
[8:15] this same jesus
[8:17] and he jesus
[8:20] the great holy one
[8:23] that walked around the left stands of
[8:26] revelation 1
[8:29] manifesting his divine glory through all
[8:32] the ages
[8:34] showing himself
[8:37] walking up and down with the seven stars
[8:40] in his hand
[8:42] oh praise god forevermore
[8:45] here he is
[8:47] the same one who walked the great shores
[8:51] of the blue galilee
[8:56] the one who walk with your pressed up
[9:00] and the possessed and heal the sick and
[9:03] raise the dead amongst them
[9:08] the one who in spite
[9:10] of all the
[9:12] uh irrefutable proof
[9:15] that
[9:16] flowed through his life
[9:19] yet was crucified and killed
[9:24] but the proof of himself
[9:27] he raised up
[9:29] in the resurrection
[9:32] and
[9:33] is seated at the right hand of power
[9:37] as messiah
[9:38] on high
[9:41] the jewish people did not call him holy
[9:44] then
[9:46] and they don't call him holy now
[9:49] but he is the holy one he is god's holy
[9:54] one
[9:55] psalm 16 10 says
[9:58] for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell
[10:03] neither will thou suffer thine
[10:06] holy one
[10:08] to see corruption
[10:10] the scripture
[10:12] is right
[10:13] the scriptures are true
[10:16] the scriptures describes him and calls
[10:20] him their holy one
[10:23] now
[10:25] they sought my friend to thought
[10:28] their
[10:29] righteousness
[10:31] were seeking to
[10:33] achieve
[10:35] righteousness
[10:37] by following the law
[10:41] and it failed
[10:44] they thought that by their
[10:47] various works
[10:49] of the law
[10:51] their scrupulous
[10:54] keeping of the law
[10:56] their adherence
[10:58] to the traditions
[11:00] of the
[11:02] law
[11:03] they felt
[11:04] that they would achieve
[11:07] holiness
[11:09] but by the law no man can be made holy
[11:13] for holiness
[11:15] is of the lord
[11:18] first corinthians 1 30 says
[11:21] but of him are ye in christ jesus
[11:25] who of god is made unto us wisdom
[11:30] and
[11:31] holiness or righteousness
[11:34] and sanctification
[11:37] and redemption second corinthians 5 21
[11:42] that we might be made
[11:45] the righteousness or holiness of god
[11:49] in him
[11:51] my friends it's christ our parish
[11:55] and they refused him
[11:58] so they perished
[12:01] now the men
[12:03] of the age
[12:06] even today
[12:07] are making the same mistake
[12:12] you see those jews back there took
[12:15] refuge
[12:17] in their synagogue
[12:19] form of worship
[12:22] as they take refuge
[12:25] behind their denominational
[12:27] forms
[12:28] of worship
[12:30] their traditional
[12:32] religious
[12:34] frames and forms of worship
[12:38] so here in this philadelphia church age
[12:42] they were taking refuge
[12:45] in the church
[12:48] but it is not joining a church
[12:51] that comes
[12:53] for the life is not in the church
[12:56] the life is in christ
[12:59] life in the sun
[13:01] life in this ever-living one hallelujah
[13:06] this is the record
[13:08] that god has given us eternal life
[13:12] and this life is in his son
[13:16] he that at the sun
[13:19] life
[13:21] and he that had not the son
[13:24] had not life
[13:26] man human being or or any human
[13:29] being any mortal
[13:32] can only be made holy by the spirit of
[13:35] god
[13:37] any mortal my friends
[13:40] for is the spirit of holiness
[13:43] that raised christ from the dead
[13:46] that same spirit of holiness
[13:49] will raise the true believer from the
[13:52] dead glory to god hallelujah and thank
[13:56] god
[13:57] now he indwells us
[13:59] he lives in me he lives in me
[14:03] oh praise the god of heaven and earth
[14:06] that he lives in me and has made us
[14:10] holy with his holiness
[14:13] we have no holiness of our own we have
[14:16] no perfections of our own
[14:19] we have no virtues of our own
[14:22] he is the one
[14:24] who indwells us
[14:26] and by indwelling us he produces his
[14:30] holiness
[14:32] he bears his own fruit
[14:35] and manifests his own
[14:38] virtues and life through us
[14:40] for his glory
[14:42] proving that he is the one
[14:45] that lives behind this veil
[14:48] the any true believing veil for his
[14:51] glory here he stands
[14:55] jesus christ the holy one
[14:58] amen glory to god he we will stand with
[15:02] him
[15:03] in that day clothed
[15:06] in
[15:07] white leaning
[15:09] amen for we walk with him through this
[15:12] world in white
[15:14] and now we are clothed
[15:16] with the purity of righteousness
[15:19] holiness of the living god as we have
[15:22] identified with him and as the bride has
[15:26] returned to his side to her rightful
[15:29] position in christ we stand with him we
[15:33] stand with him now
[15:35] we stand with him when he comes again
[15:38] will stand with him when he stands there
[15:42] in his greatness of his power glory to
[15:45] god hallelujah amen
[15:48] this six age
[15:50] in the eyes of god it was coming to a
[15:53] close
[15:56] the doors of time
[15:59] are closing fast
[16:02] the book of time
[16:04] is closing fast
[16:07] yes
[16:09] he's coming back
[16:11] jesus is coming back
[16:13] our lord has returned to earth again
[16:17] the word has returned to earth again and
[16:22] soon the cry goes forth here he comes
[16:26] the mighty one hallelujah for the lord
[16:30] himself shall descend with a shout has
[16:33] descended will descend with a shout
[16:36] glory to god a message that will raise
[16:40] you up in the latter day your faith in
[16:43] the word of god is what raises you up
[16:47] that token fate that small teeny weeny
[16:51] bit of faith even if it's a mustard seed
[16:54] revelation within your soul god will use
[16:58] that my friends as a great mighty
[17:01] fulcrum to lift you up raise you up into
[17:05] his divine presence that he might
[17:08] receive his praise and his glory from
[17:12] these vessels that he has prepared a
[17:15] four time and set them upon the earth to
[17:19] use us honorable vessels for his glory
[17:23] amen
[17:24] yes sir the cry is in the book of
[17:27] revelation
[17:31] he which is filthy
[17:34] let him be filthy still
[17:38] he that is righteous
[17:41] let hump him be or her be righteous
[17:45] still
[17:46] he
[17:47] that is holy
[17:49] let him
[17:51] be holy still revelation chapter 22
[17:56] verse 11
[17:58] he that is inside
[18:01] let him remain sealed in on the inside
[18:06] and he that is outside
[18:09] let him remain outside
[18:12] for when god shut the door
[18:15] it wasn't law that shut the door
[18:19] or shut the people out of the church out
[18:21] of the word out of the revelation it was
[18:25] god that shut them out and shut noah in
[18:31] that even if he wanted to come back out
[18:34] he could not come out for he was sealed
[18:38] unto the day of his redemption as we are
[18:41] in this hour god blinding the eyes of
[18:45] the heart
[18:46] of some
[18:48] and opening the eyes of the heart of
[18:51] others
[18:53] hallelujah
[18:54] and sealing us in
[18:57] he seals us in
[19:00] unto
[19:01] until and until
[19:04] the day of our redemption oh praise god
[19:07] forevermore so we are not kept by
[19:10] ourselves or our works we are kept by
[19:13] the power of god true faith amen
[19:17] hallelujah i'm so glad that my holiness
[19:22] the holiness that god speaks of in his
[19:24] word
[19:26] is not of my holiness my makings my
[19:30] workings or my doings not of myself
[19:35] but i'm glad
[19:37] that i was elected to be in christ
[19:40] inside of the great pattern
[19:43] work of god hallelujah
[19:46] i'm glad
[19:47] that i'm in here with him
[19:50] and with all of his other
[19:53] wonderful attributes
[19:55] that are within him
[19:59] attributes
[20:00] that were imparted
[20:02] to us
[20:03] and we receive it with grateful
[20:06] and thankful heart
[20:08] for what he has imparted to us blessed
[20:13] be our god forever
[20:16] blessed be his holy name
[20:19] heaven and earth adores you
[20:22] my heart praises and magnifies the name
[20:25] of the lord our god
[20:27] we praise him in this great day in an
[20:30] hour
[20:31] now
[20:32] the bible tells us in this verse 7
[20:37] these things
[20:39] said he
[20:41] that is true
[20:43] now this word true
[20:45] is
[20:46] really a wonderful word
[20:49] true
[20:50] because it does not mean true
[20:53] in the sense
[20:55] of being the contrast or the opposite of
[20:58] false we usually say true and false
[21:02] and so it's used as the opposite of
[21:05] false
[21:06] but it
[21:08] i'm not speaking on this from that point
[21:10] of view now
[21:12] look at it from this point of view
[21:15] as given by god's servant and prophet
[21:18] in this day and in this hour
[21:21] praise god
[21:23] true
[21:24] in other words perfect realization
[21:28] you have come to a perfect understanding
[21:33] hallelujah
[21:36] of an idea
[21:38] true
[21:39] meaning
[21:41] coming to a place
[21:43] of perfect realization
[21:47] of an idea
[21:51] in contrast
[21:54] to one who has only a partial
[21:58] understanding or partial
[22:00] revelation
[22:03] of
[22:04] an idea
[22:06] praise god
[22:08] oh my god's logos god's idea god's
[22:11] thoughts that were poured out before the
[22:14] foundation of the world
[22:16] your god either brings you into a
[22:19] perfect realization of it
[22:21] or you are left in the twilight zone of
[22:24] the shadows of understanding of a
[22:28] partial
[22:29] realization
[22:31] that is why many can be christians
[22:34] many can be so-called
[22:37] believers of this very message
[22:41] and their virgins
[22:44] but only having
[22:46] partial
[22:48] realization partial understanding
[22:52] of what god is speaking
[22:54] and saying
[22:56] from his wonderful words
[22:59] now
[22:59] for example
[23:02] in the gospel of john chapter 6 verse 32
[23:07] jesus said
[23:10] moses gave you not that bread from
[23:13] heaven
[23:14] but my father give it you
[23:17] the true bread from heaven let me repeat
[23:21] that my father
[23:23] gave it you
[23:25] the true bread from heaven and you know
[23:28] he went on to say i am
[23:31] the bread
[23:32] of life hallelujah
[23:35] praise god
[23:37] then
[23:38] john 15 1
[23:41] i am the true
[23:44] vine
[23:45] hallelujah
[23:47] now realize
[23:49] the word true also means real
[23:53] so when he says i am the true vine
[23:56] i am the real vine
[23:59] i am the true bread
[24:01] i am the real bread amen hebrews 9 24
[24:07] for christ is not entered into the holy
[24:11] places made with hands
[24:13] which are figures
[24:16] of the true
[24:18] amen
[24:20] but into heaven itself to appear in the
[24:23] presence of god for us first john
[24:26] chapter 2
[24:27] verse 8
[24:30] now the darkness is past
[24:33] and the true light
[24:35] or real light
[24:36] now shines hallelujah i thank god that
[24:41] the real spirit light that will light up
[24:44] the city has lit up my life
[24:47] and the revelation light of the word of
[24:50] god the deer star from on high has risen
[24:55] within my heart and the light of god is
[24:58] shining brightly within this heart of
[25:01] mind praise god amen in revelation 3 7
[25:08] this word
[25:10] true
[25:11] is expressing perfect realization
[25:15] against the idea
[25:17] of partial
[25:19] realization
[25:21] in other words my friends
[25:24] just as he presented himself
[25:27] and contrast
[25:29] at the true
[25:30] he that is true to these false jews
[25:34] he presented himself
[25:36] as the reality
[25:38] instead
[25:39] of just being another type
[25:43] he presents himself
[25:46] as this substance
[25:49] not
[25:50] another
[25:51] shadow
[25:52] type
[25:53] or
[25:54] substitution but the reality
[25:57] of the word of god in the words of god's
[26:00] prophet the unfailing reality of the
[26:04] living god
[26:05] here we see him
[26:08] presenting himself
[26:10] as being the
[26:12] ultimate fulfillment
[26:16] of all the types
[26:19] all the shadows
[26:21] all the
[26:22] substitutes he was saying in other words
[26:26] he that is true i am the true
[26:29] i am the fulfillment
[26:32] i am the fullness of all these types
[26:36] shadows and substitutes i am the one
[26:40] they were pointing to
[26:42] oh please god hallelujah
[26:45] amen these were only pointing to him
[26:49] but he is the ultimate reality
[26:53] he
[26:54] that is true or in other words he that
[26:58] is real thank god we don't have to deal
[27:02] with just shadows
[27:04] and live in the shadows
[27:07] of the evening time
[27:09] or the twilight
[27:11] but to walk in the light as he is in the
[27:14] light to walk in the brightness of the
[27:16] shining light of the word of god the
[27:19] effulgence of his glory has come upon us
[27:23] and we are here to glorify and magnify
[27:27] the name of our lord oh glory to god
[27:30] hallelujah
[27:32] now listen friends
[27:35] the antitype
[27:37] contrasted with type
[27:40] we are looking now
[27:42] at him separating himself
[27:45] from the shadows
[27:47] and saying i'm no longer in the shadows
[27:50] i think it's somewhere i'm just
[27:52] remembering the scripture when he tells
[27:54] his disciples i think it's somewhere in
[27:56] john 17 when he said no longer will i
[28:00] speak to you in parables no more in
[28:03] shadows but now i will speak to you
[28:07] plainly i will speak to you in reality
[28:11] and bring to you the fullness of the
[28:14] word of god thank god
[28:16] my sins are gone thank god the light has
[28:20] come the sun is risen up and the gloomy
[28:24] shadows have drifted away praise god
[28:28] hallelujah amen praise god take for
[28:32] example
[28:35] in the bible
[28:36] speaks of the manna from heaven
[28:40] how that god set down
[28:42] angels bread
[28:44] from heaven to the children of israel
[28:49] and even though they at
[28:52] angel's bread
[28:54] type of the angel to each church age
[28:58] they ate angels bread
[29:01] but
[29:02] it did not satisfy them
[29:06] it could not satisfy them
[29:10] for that bread was only good for one day
[29:14] back then in the old testament
[29:18] and it was only good
[29:21] for one church edge to which it was sent
[29:25] it could not be kept
[29:28] because if they added
[29:30] they would become
[29:32] hungry
[29:33] again
[29:34] hallelujah
[29:36] if they held it around
[29:38] not only will they be hungry
[29:41] but it would become
[29:43] contaminated
[29:45] now think of that
[29:47] that in itself to take the looter
[29:50] bringing the pure word and wesley
[29:52] bringing the pure word and each one of
[29:55] those messengers and shortly therein it
[29:58] began to become contaminated
[30:03] even the messenger to the seventh church
[30:05] age
[30:07] his message given out
[30:10] left the scene
[30:12] and his message becoming
[30:15] contaminated
[30:16] with every manner of false teaching
[30:20] doctrine conception idea
[30:22] and personal
[30:24] thoughts that man has injected within
[30:27] the word of god my friends
[30:30] the only thing or person that will keep
[30:34] you
[30:35] balanced dead online
[30:38] front sight and backside lined up
[30:41] is the great holy spirit himself
[30:45] he'll take the author of the book
[30:47] himself to be with you and in you
[30:51] to cause the book to reveal that you
[30:54] might know the path you must take
[30:58] jesus is saying
[31:01] your fathers had bread in the wilderness
[31:04] but they're all dead why that was not
[31:07] the reality
[31:08] that was only a
[31:10] substitute and a shadow
[31:12] but here i am the true
[31:16] or the real bread
[31:18] come to you
[31:20] amen and you're rejecting me the real
[31:23] bread
[31:25] that will feed your soul for men shall
[31:28] not live by these earthly mortal bread
[31:33] but live forever by the bread of life
[31:36] the fullness of the word of god
[31:39] man it was just the type
[31:42] hallelujah
[31:44] the momentum man takes
[31:46] the bread of life jesus christ
[31:49] truly believes that
[31:51] receives it lives by it
[31:54] amen
[31:55] he has eternal life
[31:58] and when he does
[32:01] here is indeed reality
[32:04] for except a man be born again
[32:07] he shall not see
[32:10] he shall not enter
[32:12] the kingdom of god
[32:15] oh my for the reality of the word opens
[32:18] his heart the eyes of his heart
[32:21] brings his soul into his invisible union
[32:25] with christ
[32:26] brings him back to his oneness with god
[32:30] and recognizing who he is where he came
[32:33] from and where he is going praise god
[32:37] hallelujah oh amen amen yes sir here
[32:42] indeed my friends
[32:45] we no longer
[32:46] have to accept
[32:48] partial salvation
[32:52] from
[32:53] partial revelations
[32:56] which we may have received
[32:58] but we can enter into perfect
[33:01] realization by perfect revelation
[33:05] through the word of god
[33:08] and enter into the fullness of our
[33:10] redemption
[33:11] by the spirit of almighty god oh here is
[33:15] the whole of it
[33:17] amen
[33:18] jesus isn't part of god
[33:21] but he is god
[33:23] he is the fullness of god made manifest
[33:27] in this hour
[33:28] no one could deny
[33:31] that when israel was down there
[33:35] uh in egypt
[33:37] they had light
[33:40] yes
[33:42] the amen they had light
[33:46] they passed through
[33:49] the passover night and there was
[33:51] darkness
[33:52] everywhere as the dark age we are
[33:55] passing through now
[33:57] darkness that can be felt evil that can
[33:59] be sensed
[34:01] and felt
[34:02] surrounded them everywhere but yet they
[34:05] had light in the midst of that amen and
[34:10] i believe they're having a celebration
[34:12] soon coming up
[34:14] speaking of this
[34:15] these great lights of which god gave
[34:19] to his people
[34:21] israel
[34:23] they were the only nation
[34:25] and the only people at that time
[34:29] that had the spiritual light of god
[34:32] in their very myths
[34:35] amen
[34:37] whoa
[34:38] when egypt was in darkness
[34:41] egypt's land was in gross darkness
[34:45] but in their homes
[34:48] in their individual lives in their
[34:50] individual homes
[34:52] amen they had lamps they had lights
[34:57] that were shining amen
[35:00] praise god and there was light
[35:04] back then but now
[35:06] the true light has come
[35:10] and is now shining when we are in a
[35:12] spiritual egypt
[35:15] and we have entered into our true house
[35:20] the house of david the house of christ
[35:23] the house of god
[35:25] entering into christ himself and in him
[35:30] is all the light life and power that we
[35:33] may ever need
[35:35] now notice
[35:37] let me illustrate here again
[35:40] how israel had not only natural light as
[35:43] they did in egypt but they had spiritual
[35:45] light when all the other nations walked
[35:48] in darkness
[35:50] for israel had their prophets
[35:53] true prophets of god
[35:55] that prophesied
[35:57] that fort told
[35:59] and told forth
[36:01] what god
[36:02] placed in their hearts
[36:04] and earned their mouths
[36:06] amen
[36:07] and so you had moses
[36:09] and you had the prophets
[36:12] and they brought spiritual light or the
[36:14] light of god
[36:16] by the means of scripture
[36:18] and prophecy
[36:20] amen
[36:22] relative or in other words all they were
[36:25] prophesying was true but it was only
[36:28] pointing to the coming reality of the
[36:32] coming messiah
[36:34] who was to come
[36:35] they were pointing to the cross
[36:38] now we are behind that and we are
[36:40] pointing back to the cross
[36:43] they were pointing to his coming we are
[36:46] pointing back to say he has already come
[36:50] and we are now the beneficiaries of his
[36:53] reaction resurrection by divine
[36:56] revelation from the word of god
[36:59] hallelujah amen
[37:02] now
[37:03] the prophets brought partial realization
[37:06] to them
[37:09] but when jesus come
[37:12] not being a prophet of god
[37:16] but the god
[37:19] of all the prophets and god being his
[37:22] own prophet
[37:24] making himself manifested
[37:28] the reality
[37:30] of what they
[37:31] were believing for
[37:34] abraham rejoiced to see my day and he
[37:37] saw it and was glad oh praise god my
[37:41] friends any true believer through the
[37:43] ages god count their partial realization
[37:47] he counted righteousness he imputed to
[37:50] them righteousness just as if they were
[37:53] back here and it was already done they
[37:55] already believed to the coming of the
[37:58] messiah and the word of god hallelujah
[38:02] and so they have the same
[38:04] pay
[38:05] or same salvation
[38:07] whether they worked in the morning or
[38:09] their work midday or their work in the
[38:11] late evening hour it was the same
[38:14] salvation same reality came to them by
[38:18] the word of the living god
[38:20] now the fulfillment of the light has
[38:23] come
[38:23] jesus christ the messiah amen amen that
[38:28] glowing word of god that was just
[38:31] glowing points of light through the
[38:33] history and time has now broken forth in
[38:37] the morning light of the day star
[38:41] shining bright as an art wilder's act
[38:44] light shining so bright shining upon us
[38:48] oh praise god bringing to us the clarity
[38:51] the distilled clarity of the word of god
[38:54] through the ages amen through the filter
[38:58] of the of a prophet's mind being used
[39:02] and the word of god hallelujah filtered
[39:05] out to us placed in a storehouse and now
[39:09] we are partakers of that unfailing
[39:12] reality of the living god oh thank god
[39:16] forevermore hallelujah that glowing word
[39:21] has grown
[39:23] into its brightness and shining splendor
[39:27] god manifested among his people
[39:31] emmanuel
[39:33] amen
[39:34] god in flesh appearing praise god now
[39:39] light and life combined and manifested
[39:43] in the fullness of the godhead
[39:46] bodily
[39:47] the godhead in a body jesus christ
[39:51] hallelujah amen glory to god
[39:55] now remember how israel used to take
[39:58] their red heifer and today
[40:01] they're still looking for a red heifer
[40:03] and they will sacrifice her upon the
[40:05] altar for the remission of sins
[40:09] and using the ashes and so on then then
[40:12] we find my friends
[40:15] each year a man would come and do a
[40:17] sacrifice
[40:19] wash
[40:21] and go back
[40:22] but he was only covered his sins were
[40:25] only covered and he had to come back and
[40:27] next year
[40:29] for him to continue being forgiven of
[40:33] his sins but it was not a perfect
[40:35] offering because he had to return back
[40:38] and forth you can read these things in
[40:39] the book of hebrews paul speaks about it
[40:42] how the sinner had to be coming back
[40:44] every year amen and this is what this is
[40:47] what jesus meant when he said if you eat
[40:49] of this bread you'll live forever amen
[40:52] you come and get washed by this blood of
[40:54] christ not the heifer's blood but the
[40:57] blood of christ you if you're washed you
[41:00] don't need to be washed again hallelujah
[41:03] oh praise god hallelujah amen yes sir so
[41:08] here we are crucified jesus christ
[41:12] the perfect one
[41:14] sacrifice for our sins
[41:17] once
[41:18] for all time
[41:20] for all men that will believe
[41:23] hallelujah one sacrifice
[41:27] and it was done
[41:29] certified
[41:30] sealed by the living god for he sat down
[41:35] in finality praise god we receive him in
[41:40] our hearts
[41:41] we thank god for this my friends that we
[41:45] are walking in his righteousness and
[41:48] reality of his word romans 8 2 says
[41:52] for the law
[41:54] of the spirit of life in christ jesus
[41:57] had made us free
[42:00] from the law of death
[42:04] and sin
[42:05] you see the shed the shed blood of a
[42:08] heifer or any other animal that was used
[42:12] back then whether pigeon
[42:15] sheep goat
[42:17] women the god that was left to go into
[42:21] the wilderness we use the term today uh
[42:24] scapegoat which is just a short term
[42:28] referring back to that many don't
[42:30] realize it but it was the escaped
[42:34] goat the one that the high priest killed
[42:37] the male
[42:38] and set the female free to escape
[42:42] into the wilderness where she will find
[42:45] her way it's the same way my friends
[42:49] escaped thank god but now my friends
[42:53] jesus christ has died in our place took
[42:57] our place at calvary and we are escaped
[43:01] hallelujah once for all time for all
[43:05] eternity to the glory and praise of the
[43:08] living gods hallelujah
[43:11] amen
[43:12] the jews back then
[43:16] did not want to accept
[43:18] the sacrifice
[43:20] of jesus christ
[43:22] the blood of bulls and goats made
[43:24] nothing perfect
[43:26] amen and to this day
[43:29] we watch i watch with wonder and
[43:31] amazement a jewish attachment
[43:34] the tapes
[43:36] shadows
[43:38] substitutes instead of
[43:41] jesus their real messiah
[43:44] their real sacrifice
[43:47] their real atonement
[43:49] i watch with amazement
[43:52] at these denominational forms not only
[43:55] of synagogue worship cathedral worship
[43:58] denominational worship traditional
[44:00] worship
[44:02] organizational worship trained worship
[44:05] my friends i look with amazement
[44:10] where
[44:11] with a certain amount of religious
[44:14] comfort
[44:15] they seem to accept all these things
[44:17] because it's all coached
[44:20] in religious terms
[44:23] any religious persuasions
[44:27] and
[44:28] religious emotions that seem to draw
[44:31] them into a
[44:33] a spirit a sense of spirituality
[44:37] yet they have not come to the fullness
[44:40] of the real
[44:41] word of god
[44:43] and the manifestation
[44:46] of the truth
[44:49] my friends
[44:51] what they had
[44:52] was once
[44:54] indeed
[44:55] god's ordained method
[44:58] but the whole thing has changed from law
[45:00] to grace
[45:02] it's changed from substitute to
[45:05] substance
[45:08] it's changed from types and shadows
[45:12] to jesus christ
[45:14] he that is true he that is real it's
[45:18] changed to the unfailing reality
[45:22] of the living god in our day in our time
[45:27] jesus christ
[45:29] by the shedding of his own blood
[45:32] put away all sin
[45:35] by offering
[45:37] himself
[45:38] hallelujah praise god
[45:41] and his name
[45:43] his sacrifice
[45:46] his shedding of his blood
[45:49] has made us perfect
[45:51] no animal blood
[45:54] could make us perfect it could only
[45:56] cover
[45:57] for a time but jesus christ his blood
[46:02] once for all
[46:05] set us free
[46:06] from the laws of sin
[46:09] and death
[46:10] glory be to god
[46:12] o praise god
[46:14] hallelujah
[46:16] what about this philadelphia church age
[46:20] what about these are the church ages
[46:23] that have passed
[46:25] did they accept the fullness reality in
[46:28] christ
[46:29] no sir
[46:31] no sir for they were only
[46:34] they only were allowed to see remember
[46:37] shadows types were god's ordained metal
[46:40] method until the reality
[46:44] and the fullness came
[46:46] thus luther and all the other messengers
[46:50] were allowed to bring partial truth
[46:54] through the ages
[46:56] he brought the truth of justification
[46:58] but that was only a part of the truth as
[47:01] god started on his great program of the
[47:04] fullness to
[47:06] the fullness of all restoration of his
[47:09] word which was eaten away from his
[47:12] church from his people from his beloved
[47:15] bride of christ amen amen and when
[47:19] luther brought justification the romans
[47:22] church
[47:23] and their eastern counterpart or the
[47:26] orthodox church
[47:28] still
[47:31] hugged
[47:32] and clung
[47:34] onto their works
[47:36] religious works religious acts
[47:39] religious forms
[47:41] traditional forms they held onto it with
[47:46] everything else doing religious
[47:49] charitable good deeds and charitable
[47:52] works of everything else and let me say
[47:55] works are fine
[47:58] but they don't save you and they cannot
[48:01] save you
[48:03] they do not make you perfect
[48:06] no matter how much candles you burn no
[48:08] matter how much you flagellate yourself
[48:11] no matter how much you sacrifice
[48:14] it is not your sacrifice your works your
[48:17] flagellations it is he jesus christ has
[48:21] suffered once for all
[48:24] isaiah 53 he was wounded for our
[48:28] transgressions
[48:30] he was bruised for our iniquities
[48:33] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[48:37] him and by his stripes we are healed we
[48:42] are saved we are forgiven we are
[48:44] redeemed we are sealed by the power of
[48:47] god true faith in him lord of god
[48:50] hallelujah amen but do they accept god's
[48:54] reality in christ
[48:56] amen all my friends
[48:59] it's christ our parish
[49:03] it's the reality of the word or perish
[49:07] it is not even christ
[49:10] and my good works
[49:15] it's jesus christ jesus and jesus
[49:18] christ
[49:20] and christ alone
[49:22] for salvation
[49:25] is of the lord
[49:27] not salvation
[49:28] and good works or salvation by good
[49:32] works
[49:34] this is not
[49:36] salvation
[49:38] plus good works
[49:40] no sir
[49:41] amen
[49:43] even the armenians
[49:46] do not believe in christ
[49:48] as the full reality
[49:51] because they don't sing
[49:55] nothing but the blood
[49:59] but when they do sing that song
[50:02] it should they sing it in a way i don't
[50:05] mean in reality
[50:06] but in fact this is their way of
[50:09] thinking of it
[50:10] nothing but the blood
[50:13] plus my good conduct
[50:16] but now friends
[50:18] salvation is of the lord
[50:21] it is not
[50:23] his works
[50:25] plus your good conduct
[50:27] because by
[50:29] adding your work so you could conduct
[50:32] you are giving the picture that he did
[50:35] not do a perfect work at the cross and
[50:39] you are now going to finish his work by
[50:42] adding on your good works and your good
[50:45] conducts to bring perfection to your
[50:47] salvation
[50:49] but our bible tells us he did a perfect
[50:52] work he is perfection of perfection he
[50:55] is the perfect one he is the perfect
[50:58] everything jesus christ the same
[51:01] yesterday today and forever hallelujah
[51:05] you are if you're really truly saved
[51:08] you will do righteously
[51:10] like any sheep will bear will
[51:13] automatically
[51:16] if you're really a real christian
[51:19] you don't have to i don't have to do
[51:20] this
[51:21] that i don't no
[51:23] there's not don't listen don't do this
[51:25] and don't do that the holy spirit in you
[51:28] the spirit of christ in you the perfect
[51:30] one in you he will keep you he will
[51:34] produce his own works he will bear the
[51:37] world of virtues the life the holiness
[51:39] the purity amen he will bear it through
[51:43] you
[51:44] amen praise be to god hallelujah amen so
[51:49] these church ages
[51:51] only had partial realization
[51:55] but now
[51:56] at the end of the church ages
[51:59] the fullness of the word of god has come
[52:03] to bring us into a perfect realization
[52:06] of what he was saying down through the
[52:11] ages
[52:12] amen i believe i'll have to speak on
[52:15] sunday
[52:16] i will be speaking again and i trust the
[52:19] holy spirit will help us and speak to us
[52:22] in every possible way praise god
[52:25] hallelujah my friends let me say this
[52:27] what i'm saying
[52:29] salvation is not jesus plus your good
[52:31] works
[52:33] it is jesus alone
[52:36] salvation
[52:38] is of the lord
[52:42] from start to finish
[52:45] it is all
[52:46] of
[52:48] the god and all of the lord so let his
[52:52] life live in me
[52:53] let him live through me
[52:55] let him teach me how to surrender
[52:58] let him teach me how to let go
[53:01] let him teach me how to rest
[53:04] upon his unfailing word
[53:07] that he might live through me
[53:10] let it be his blood
[53:12] that cleanses me
[53:14] not my good works
[53:16] let it be his spirit that fills me
[53:20] let it be his word in my heart and mouth
[53:23] that cleanses me that inspires me and
[53:26] speaks and manifests through me let his
[53:29] let it be that by his stripes
[53:32] we are healed
[53:35] let it be jesus and jesus alone
[53:39] not by works of righteousness which i
[53:41] have done
[53:44] but by his grace and mercy he has saved
[53:47] us
[53:48] for he christ is our life
[53:51] and one day as the scriptures have said
[53:53] when he
[53:54] christ jesus our life shall appear
[53:57] oh praise god i thank god for this amen
[54:02] my friends
[54:04] listen to a b simpson
[54:07] the founder of the alliance church a
[54:10] great man of god an anointed servant of
[54:13] the most high god
[54:15] he penned these memorable
[54:18] words
[54:20] once it was the blessing
[54:23] once i sought the blessing
[54:26] now it is the lord
[54:29] once
[54:31] i wanted feeling
[54:34] but now it is the word
[54:37] once his gift i wanted
[54:41] now the giver i own
[54:44] once i sought for healing

[55:03] praise god my friends i tell you
[55:08] jesus
[55:09] you will find the sum total of all
[55:12] perfection
[55:13] the culmination
[55:16] the confluence of all perfection
[55:20] this finds itself in jesus christ
[55:23] because it comes to him and it points to
[55:26] him and everything else fades
[55:29] in significance
[55:32] in insignificant
[55:34] beside the lord jesus christ
[55:38] the rising of the sun
[55:40] the fading away of the light of the
[55:43] stars
