[26:05] life little children keep yourself from
[26:11] Idols
[26:12] amen may the Lord had his Blessing
[26:16] please be
[26:22] seated when you see natural tree seed
[26:29] everything that that tree going to
[26:31] be all the fruit that tree going to
[26:35] be is already in that
[26:42] seed not because you put it in the
[26:45] ground then when it grow
[26:49] then then the seed that is coming
[26:53] because you you you you bury then that
[26:56] seed comes inside no
[26:59] the
[27:00] seed that little seed that you have
[27:04] everything that seed going to be is
[27:06] already in that
[27:09] seed God sent you
[27:12] here you came from
[27:15] him every faith
[27:19] everything that you going to be in God
[27:22] is already in
[27:24] you hallelujah it's already in you
[27:27] before you came
[27:28] here because remember you are part of
[27:31] God the true wife of Christ is part of
[27:36] God and you were in spirit form before
[27:39] you were put into
[27:41] flesh so when you were in spirit
[27:46] form you were part of God and now that
[27:50] God has sent you here as Humanity
[27:53] everything where you whatever you going
[27:56] to be is already in you
[28:00] that's why the devil can never defeated
[28:03] you he
[28:05] cannot completely defeated you if you
[28:09] are a true bride of
[28:11] Christ because God took
[28:15] himself broke himself and that part that
[28:19] he broke is you and me and all the wife
[28:24] of Christ that will be in this last age
[28:28] we come in stages but remember we in the
[28:31] last hour right so no matter what Satan
[28:36] is
[28:37] doing have confidence in
[28:40] yourself that God that who has sent you
[28:44] here won't disappoint
[28:47] you he will not disappoint you amen
[28:51] because the work is already
[28:55] done because
[28:58] his Spirit you are born of his bone
[29:02] flesh of his
[29:04] flesh Spirit of his
[29:07] Spirit if you are the bride so how can
[29:11] Satan defeat
[29:13] you if you recognize who you
[29:17] are there's nothing that will shake
[29:20] you then when the enemy even sees you he
[29:24] is running for
[29:26] cover because
[29:30] why let's
[29:31] say you
[29:34] think King
[29:36] Charles is afraid of somebody in the
[29:40] world because he know his King
[29:44] Char what no matter where you place him
[29:48] in this world he know who he is and he
[29:52] speak with
[29:54] authority the bride must speak with
[29:57] authority
[29:58] we must speak with power because the
[30:01] power lay in
[30:05] you
[30:07] recognize at this hour we are not in the
[30:10] hour
[30:13] whereby you should be
[30:16] afraid you should allow the devil to
[30:18] push you around
[30:21] no stand on the post of
[30:24] Duty when you place a soldier in in in a
[30:28] duty and the soldier know who he is
[30:31] there is nothing that going to move
[30:35] him nothing can move him no
[30:39] enemy nobody can shake him up because he
[30:42] know he's placed there for a purpose you
[30:47] are placed here for a
[30:50] purpose you are part
[30:53] of the God who created this everything
[30:58] your eye could see the things your eye
[31:00] couldn't even see he is the one that
[31:02] created it so why should we be
[31:06] afraid why should we be allowed Satan
[31:11] who is
[31:12] created to sometime push us
[31:16] around if we have God in
[31:19] us then we should have confidence in him
[31:23] that all things are
[31:25] possible with him all things not half
[31:29] all all a a l all things are
[31:36] possible if we don't recognize
[31:39] that then the enemy will always attack
[31:43] us he will attack you he will attack
[31:47] your children he will
[31:49] attack your family you will attack your
[31:52] even attack your boss to to prosecute
[31:56] you because you don't know who you are
[31:59] but if you know who you are and you
[32:02] stand on the post of Duty the enemy can
[32:06] never in life move you because you have
[32:10] confidence in God
[32:12] Amen no sickness no disease no poverty
[32:17] no pain no anything can move you you you
[32:21] are able to do what Shake It Off give it
[32:24] back to
[32:26] Satan because is not yours those things
[32:30] are not
[32:32] yours yours is the part that come from
[32:38] God and God there when he was here Jesus
[32:42] Christ nothing could defeat him when
[32:46] Satan touch him he says it's written
[32:50] it's written it's
[32:52] written what does he do he take him back
[32:55] to the word and you are part of the that
[32:58] word now is your time take him back to
[33:01] the
[33:02] word and always he will free from you he

[33:17] bride you can't be lost your position in
[33:20] Christ cannot change but he can make you
[33:26] miserable but if you recognize that hey

[33:32] of
[33:33] Duty then you sometime you go places you
[33:37] see the enemy you can see him even try
[33:41] to use people to against you then in

[34:26] thing change
[34:28] the whole thing will change the whole
[34:30] atmosphere will change because God live

[34:39] if
[34:41] you God by his grace have let you
[34:46] recognize the seals that has
[34:49] opened has let you
[34:52] recognize the message of the hour that
[34:56] is coming forth through the prophet
[34:58] message that is revealing at this moment
[35:03] it
[35:04] shows you are part of
[35:10] God have confidence on that and believe
[35:16] that and says even if you get sick even
[35:22] if anything that is happened to you you
[35:24] are willing to stand on the post of Duty
[35:29] because God won't forsake
[35:32] you God will never you go you pick this
[35:36] Bible and show me one person in the
[35:40] Bible God has
[35:42] forsaken which human being that have
[35:44] served God from the bottom of his heart
[35:48] in
[35:49] history up to now that God has forsaken
[35:52] them there's no such a thing my
[35:56] brother if you you can show me one I'll
[35:59] deny the Bible and go and follow you but
[36:03] there's
[36:04] nobody that tell us that the Lord Jesus
[36:08] Christ is the one true God he's the one
[36:12] true healer amen and his name every knee
[36:16] will bow every tongue will confess that
[36:20] Jesus Christ is Lord amen whether they
[36:23] like it or
[36:24] not whether the whole world like it or
[36:28] not they're going to
[36:31] Bow
[36:35] listen brother
[36:37] Abraham prophesied to us God in him says
[36:42] Los Angeles will come under the sea the
[36:46] whole California will come under the sea
[36:49] Now You See Fire is started to burn
[36:52] before Sodom and goor was about to be
[36:55] burned right fire came down and start
[36:59] burning the whole place right people
[37:03] were living there 50 years they says we
[37:05] don't want to move some of them what
[37:07] happened fire has burned them listen to
[37:11] the news but some of them they running
[37:13] because why even though this is what I'm
[37:16] seeing God is giving some of them Grace
[37:19] to run for their life but human beings
[37:23] they are so
[37:24] stubble they'll go right back in
[37:28] but even if they know there not my time
[37:33] future woman being wanted to always put
[37:37] those things in future my brother my
[37:39] sister whether we like it or not on the
[37:43] prophet says does say the Lord Los
[37:46] Angeles California go under the sea I
[37:50] believe it I believe it I believe from
[37:54] the bottom of my heart it's coming
[37:58] it's coming it's coming none of them can
[38:02] stop it nobody can stop it it's coming
[38:05] it may look like it's ter but it's
[38:08] coming because the prophet William
[38:11] Braham prophesied it God in him it was
[38:15] not him it was the Lord
[38:19] speaking through his servant he w't let
[38:22] his servants W fall to the ground and
[38:27] let me tell you even every five4
[38:32] Ministry when they are preaching God
[38:35] will not let their words fall into the
[38:39] ground people don't know it's not men
[38:43] that choose to stand to preach by
[38:46] themselves if you are not
[38:49] chosen then you God will let your your
[38:52] words fall to the ground like that but
[38:55] if you are chosen by God God to be a
[38:59] pastor to be a evangelist to be a
[39:03] teacher to be a prophet I mean manual
[39:07] Prophet to
[39:10] be I forgot the other one it will
[39:13] come the 54 Ministry if you were
[39:18] chosen to stand in the
[39:21] Pulpit regardless how you think the
[39:24] person may not able to preach the way
[39:26] you want
[39:28] let me tell you if God has
[39:32] chosen be careful what you speak against
[39:36] him
[39:38] because you don't know what they go
[39:41] through you have no idea like our pastor
[39:45] you have no idea what what he goes
[39:48] through even we the little ones you have
[39:51] no idea what we go through sometime you
[39:55] go to bed you cannot even sleep
[39:58] because God dance with our heart he
[40:03] takes our heart and he's moving us the
[40:07] way he want the word to come
[40:09] out he move him the way he want the word
[40:12] to come out to us and so is
[40:16] you hearing the word even sitting in the
[40:19] bench you go out you open your mouth to
[40:23] somebody on the word and they speak
[40:27] speak against you they are not speaking
[40:30] against you do you know who they are
[40:32] speaking against is the Lord and Savior
[40:35] Jesus
[40:37] Christ and God will deal with them
[40:40] that's why he
[40:41] says my word will never return unto me
[40:45] void it will
[40:47] accomplish what I have
[40:51] spoken this is do say the Lord this is
[40:56] not a man this is the
[40:58] reality people don't know how God does
[41:03] things God way he says my ways are not
[41:06] your ways my thought are not your
[41:11] thought because his ways is not the way
[41:15] we humans think and when he call you he
[41:19] don't call you to to fish out and use
[41:24] your human sense to figure him you
[41:28] cannot you can figure God God have so
[41:33] many ways that even we don't know
[41:37] yet he is the one that
[41:39] reveal if he don't reveal we have
[41:42] nothing to say Amen but by
[41:47] Grace he give it to us not because we
[41:51] Are Holy not because we do good not
[41:55] because we know too much
[41:57] this is this gospel is not by education
[42:00] as desmon was
[42:03] saying so many people think it's by
[42:06] education it's
[42:09] not it's God that calls God that
[42:13] choose sometime the people he choose
[42:16] them my God just imagine you are living
[42:21] in the day of John the Baptist he comes
[42:24] to the
[42:25] pulpit that man all he know is Lay as to
[42:29] the
[42:30] root all his teeth when he's
[42:34] talking is man he's think he don't know
[42:40] ABCD but he's talking about the gospel
[42:43] you're going to speak against him you're
[42:46] going to talk against him oh this man is
[42:49] this that man is this that no God chose
[42:55] when he chose he chose
[42:58] we woman being we don't understand
[43:01] things we want to figure God to do
[43:04] things no God need our heart all he
[43:08] requests let me tell you if we can give
[43:12] us his
[43:13] heart nothing he cannot
[43:16] do
[43:18] nothing
[43:20] miracles signs
[43:22] wonders he can perform it easy for us to
[43:26] see if we obey
[43:29] him God need a
[43:32] heart not headache not head knowledge
[43:37] what are you going to give it to God
[43:39] what I'm going to give it to God nothing
[43:43] my heart my heart only Lord take my
[43:48] heart and possess it because the sons of
[43:53] God no matter what Satan is doing
[43:58] he can never defeat
[44:00] us because you know why the seed of God
[44:04] lay in our heart and that seed every
[44:08] seed must bring forth his kind sir God
[44:13] will let that seed come forth just like
[44:16] a woman who is pregnant when the baby is
[44:20] about to come out that Spirit whether
[44:24] you like it or not any body can say
[44:27] whatever they want can they say oh we
[44:30] pushing the child we won't let this
[44:32] child come no it's nature we call it
[44:36] nature it going to come forth so is you
[44:39] and me because we are seed of
[44:43] God when the time reach for God sometime
[44:48] even you you try to run you try to go
[44:53] your way but it won't work because God
[44:58] will hunt you God will bring you if you
[45:04] have to drag you he will drag you if you
[45:07] you have to break your leg he will break
[45:10] it chop off your hand he will chop it
[45:13] off because he want his son to come to
[45:16] his presence and worship him he deserve
[45:20] your Praises he inhabit your Praises
[45:24] it's you that make him happy do you know
[45:27] when the bride is sad God is sad do you
[45:31] know when you become sad God look at you
[45:34] he says my God I created you for my
[45:38] pleasure I created you to worship me I
[45:42] created you to give me glory and honor
[45:45] and now look at my son look at my
[45:48] daughter no God want you as our pastor

[46:23] glory my God people want to see leg move
[46:28] H hand move while they are sick and they
[46:32] can't give God a glory do you
[46:37] know that's why when you look at this
[46:40] church I'm talking even all over the
[46:43] world but let me use our church which
[46:47] doctor can come and sit here which
[46:49] lawyer is sitting here which PhD person
[46:53] is sitting
[46:55] here even if they come there are not
[46:59] many they are not many because they
[47:02] going to wear their glasses the way even
[47:04] I'm preaching and look like
[47:07] this no everything they want to analiz
[47:13] it but God want you to be like a fool in
[47:17] the people
[47:18] eye God will get the glory for that God
[47:24] will honor his word for that people will
[47:27] prosecute you so this person is
[47:31] dummy this person don't know

[47:48] sick even though sickness has got hold
[47:50] of you give God the
[47:52] praise you come to church give him the
[47:55] praise yesterday I was sitting in front
[47:58] of the
[47:59] doctor and the doctor I was thinking my
[48:03] God tomorrow I'm going to preach I'm so
[48:06] sick what I'm going to
[48:09] do I started in my mind I said Lord yes

[48:56] going the grave still give God the
[49:00] praise
[49:03] brother give God the praise why you are
[49:07] going down why do you think Lazarus was
[49:10] raised when Lazarus was going in the
[49:12] grave I believe he was giving the Lord a
[49:15] praise so the spirit of the Lord went
[49:18] into the grave with him and he cannot
[49:21] stay there cuz the Bible says absent
[49:26] from this body present with the Lord the
[49:29] Lord can't let him stay in the grave
[49:32] after 4 days he have to bring him
[49:37] up what do you think you remember one of
[49:40] the Prophet I think he was
[49:42] elishah
[49:44] right when the Israelites went to
[49:49] war and they were kill one of the
[49:52] prophet and the Phil I think Philistines
[49:57] were killing them of
[49:59] soul and they realized they throw one is
[50:02] Ally on that
[50:04] grave that body came back to life what
[50:08] do you think was laying in that grave
[50:11] life Christ life was in that grave so
[50:15] every time they they they they they
[50:17] tried to kill the Israelites they when
[50:20] they saw it they pick the body they
[50:22] throw in that grave and that body became
[50:25] what light
[50:27] when you come to the presence of the
[50:29] Lord whether you are
[50:32] weak even if you have
[50:35] backslide even if you are sick even if
[50:38] you don't like to praise him let me tell
[50:41] you there is life in in in Christ so
[50:46] once you are here give him praise
[50:49] Hallelujah Give Him Glory Hallelujah you
[50:52] will see the Life coming back to you you
[50:55] see how you will become light
