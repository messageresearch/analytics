TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good evening friends it's Easter time and I'm here again with you today I will be conducting the Lord's Supper better known as communion the Lord richly bless you today with this meditation let us read out all the scriptures and as they were eating Jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the New Testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins little spring our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this marvelous gift of yourself coming down to earth to die for us in the form of Jesus Christ or Lord take all the glory and praise Ananda and bless this marvelous communion service to us in Jesus name Amen and amen well today this evening friends I would certainly love to speak to you on the significance of communion as they were eating the scripture said on the night before Jesus was crucified he and 12 of the disciples went into the upper room to observe their last meal together better known as the Last Supper at the end of the supper Jesus picked up a piece of bread and instituted the first communion there ever was bread was used but what kind of bread it wasn't just any kind of bread it was unleavened bread now the law of Moses had commanded that the Jews will use unleavened bread and they do to this very day at their pass over celebrations here is what Paul said your glorying is not good knowing not what a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are on limb for even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth now we understand in those times when Moses commanded that they should use unleavened bread leaven of course we know today yeast what and it was to be taken out or purged out of the house of every Jew and we must purge out sin wickedness evil in sincerity dishonesty lies first them out completely out of our lives so first of all when we come together to take the Lord's Supper better known as communion we must first of all take the bread into our hands in a spiritual sense this is where communion begins he gives the bread but we must take it God gives the word but we must accept it he gives the revelation we must receive it we must voluntarily take God's Word we must voluntarily accept the revelation of this day none of this hour within our hearts we cannot partake of this great sacrifice of our Lord Jesus amen we cannot do it by ourselves just by ourselves but by faith he gives it to us and we must receive it within our hearts and that revelation of the word of God changes our entire lives now we know according to the scriptures Jesus said I am the bread of life Jesus is the bread of life he gave his life for us that we might live and we ought to receive him as the Living bread of life within our hearts and humble ourselves before him confessing our faults before him surrendering our lives to him that he may become our not only our Savior but the more lies let us confess our unworthiness let us confess our sin to him let us ask the Lord Jesus to come into our hearts as Lord and Master of our lives amen today as I speak pick up the bread that he has given to us pick up the revelation that he has given to us and take it into your heart now Jesus is represented in the unleavened bread for the Bible tells us he was without sin totally unleavened without any sin whatsoever whatever level is a form of course of corruption East the mixture gives a lot of flavor and in sin there is a pleasure of sin but the ends thereof are the ways of death so let us live lives that were unleavened and cleanse from the leaven of sin corruption that is within the heart of man it is a sin friends when we live contrary to the Word of God it is sin in the art of man that causes him to rebuild against God as in the Garden of Eden this rebellion of this modern day filled with pride arrogance and loins and tremendous entrace come instead of thanking God for His grace man repels against God and even blames God for the misfortunes that he has created upon his own self we must clean out sin for our lives we must do this and trust in him and him alone by receiving the blood the lamb or blessing Lord Jesus Christ within our hearts and ask him for the remission of our sins now Jesus this great one this first step in taking of the Lord's Supper is that we must cleanse our hearts from sin we must have Jesus come within our lives and ask him to be the savior of our souls it is only by the repenting of our sins and receiving him within her heart that we are prepared to pick up this bread of life pick up the Word of God pick up the revelation of God's Word for your day and a message for your day Jesus of course as the Bible tells us took up the bread and He blessed it He blessed the bread now we know that no Jew would think of eating without blessing whatever they eat there are very religious people very believing people in the great Jehovah who spoke to them and said hear o Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord they are believing people just as we as Christians are with all our faults all our failures our mistakes we try to be a believing people our mistakes may be many but we are a believing people and we want to come to God and ask for his cleansing and for His forgiveness now on this Memorial Day of the Passover note you will take a part of that Paschal meal without prayer in the presence of the great of mighty Elohim Joe our God it is their tradition to say grace before meals and as a result Christians also have adopted the same measure that whenever we are about to eat within our homes we use the term grace before meals now we cannot receive Jesus as our Savior without giving thanks to God for him we must thank God that he gave him to us this blessed Savior this bread of life for man cannot live by natural bread alone but he must live by the Word of God which was freely given to us by our God and our Father let us be having a grateful heart today let us not sorrow that he died upon the cross but let us give thanks that God gave him to us to die for our sins and to be our substitutionary sacrifice we know that God sent him so that we may come to know that we have eternal life and we have forgiveness through him it is only because of God's love and mercy and grace that we are given this wonderful gift of eternal life through election before the foundation of the world and is only it's only proper that we continually give thanks to God and thank him for his wonderful grace on pardon to us now the word spoken in our times by Jewish customs are these blessed be Thou O God King of the universe who brings forth bread out the earth for us we bless and thank God who in his love has provided that wonderful food for us now in the book of Revelation John said I heard a voice like the thundering of many waters saying blessings and glory and honor and power be unto thee O God who who was and is and is to come and the twenty-four elders cast down their crowns before God amen they said amen amen which means so let it be O Lord let us also say Amen so be it Lord this is an honor and glory and power beyond today now after the blessing Jesus broke the bread bread in the days of the Lord Jesus was not ah a loaf as we know it they made what is called select flatbread it was it was crispy and flat and they had to break it and eat it it was not a loaf that we can take a beautiful bread knife and slice it into beautiful slices but it was rough hewn bread baked no doubt in certain ovens and it had to be broken by hand and eaten and it was a bit crunchy sin and brittle and was easier to break than to cut now the breaking of the bread by the Lord Jesus in the first communion is significant to us as believers that we must recognize that he was that he was bruised and that he was broken and died on the cross for us it is written in Isaiah chapter 53 verses 4 to 6 surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken and smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by His stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one in his own way and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all that is the description of God's Living bread that was broken for you that is the description of that bread and we must recognize in our day that Jesus was broken for us that he suffered on that rugged cross and it was for us only then are we able to receive him within our hearts surely we want to thank God that in our day God has broken open the word to us for us to understand and receive him within our hearts the seven seals of the book of Revelation has been opened us up to us that we may receive that life the inspiration and the revelation from it within our very hearts how thankful we ought to be and receive him within our hearts now notice carefully when Jesus broke the bread for the disciples he gave each gave the bread to each of his disciples and it was necessary for each one of them to pick up their piece of the bread are you following me it is necessary for every believer every disciple to pick up his or her piece of bread for themselves no disciple was asked to pick up a piece for his brother or for his sister but each had to pick their own piece individually each for themselves and so is it with the Word of God each must catch the inspiration the understanding of Revelation for themselves each must brick take up the broken bread which he by grace has chosen to break the bread for us on our behalf broken on the cross nailed to the cross for us and we cannot receive him into our hearts interlace until we recognize that he the revelation was broken for everybody but in particularly broken for you individually to see it to recognize the Word of God to understand it and receive him within your heart we must recognize the opening of the word personally we must recognize that it was done to that we might take him in for salvation is by revelation upon this rock will I build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail again against it for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father in here has revealed this on to you and upon this rock of Revelation amen will I build my church and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it thank God for this realization and awareness of what really happened at Calvary each man each woman each young person each child must understand the significance of that substitutionary sacrifice the male dying for his life God dying for man we must understand the significance and the revelation of what the communion is about it is a personal and individual thing that comes directly to you and it is between you and your Savior who alone died for your sins now we know that no man on earth can pronounce salvation upon you and Here I am today even though I'm an ordained minister of God I cannot import salvation to you I cannot impart let me repeat I cannot impart salvation unto you salvation from sin from him from death and the grave I cannot give salvation to any person only Jesus himself can do that as it is written in the scriptures first Timothy 2:5 but there is one God and one mediator between God and man men Christ Jesus and again it is written neither is there salvation in any other for there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of Jesus Christ that is why we pray in the name of Jesus Christ that is why baptism should be in the name of Jesus Christ and we do baptized there in the name of Jesus Christ which is scriptural baptism and if you are not baptized that way you'll need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and take on the name of your spiritual husband Jesus Christ our Lord the scripture is written friends clearly there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if we are to receive God's blessings within our hearts and within our lives each individual must come to Jesus for their own selves find some secret place within your heart and cry out to him tears are a language that God understands where wherever you are wherever you are wherever you're watching or listening or hearing this come to him now he will hear your earnest prayer he will answer the call he will answer you're crying you're crying your call to him touches his heart and God will answer the cry or your hearts cry I cannot give you a relationship with God you must do that for yourself to bring yourself back into relationship with God oh if many of you here this afternoon this wonderful afternoon this evening can do it but in your heart but in your lives asking him for His grace for His mercy and for his pardon now Jesus then said after giving them the bread this is my body now we there were many who teach the doctrine of transubstantiation that when they observe the communion that the bread and the wine literally becomes the body and the blood of Jesus Christ each time they do the communion I want you to know that is religious nonsense and cannot be found anywhere in the Bible now Jesus never intended for his natural body to be it physically nor his piss his blood the chemicals of his blood to be consumed in the literal sense and at the commune First Communion he did not break off parts of his body and give that to his disciples telling them to eat it neither did he neither did he drain his own blood out of his veins into a cup and tell them to drink it and we would be cannibalistic if we were to do that naturally speaking like that at this particular time we observe communion and we only use brand unleavened bread and wine as symbols of what took place and what has happened and what was given to us at Calvary now we know bread is a symbol of his broken body the wine is a symbol of his blood shed for us and the observe this great sacrifice by an act of obedience through these symbolic elements Jesus then take took the cup and he gave thanks tricky all of it this cup of course we know was only representative ah and still is representative of all of his suffering and all of his blood that was poured out for us to free us from our sins I say thank you lord thank you Lord Jesus thank you for your blood that was shed for us thank you that you poured out your soul for us glory be to God thank your father may all have an inert bless your name and give your glory and honor forever and forever world without end amen blessed be the name of the Living God now without the blood are my sins your sins cannot be washed away without the blood we cannot be made cleansed and whiter than snow without the blood of Jesus there is no atonement for our sins and without that precious blood there is no hope for heaven and home thank you Jesus for giving your life's blood for us here today we acknowledge that we are grateful we have take full and we lift our hearts and hands on voices in praise and honor and glory to your name on this which is called Good Friday evening but now let us recognize it wasn't the broken body that brought the salvation it wasn't the strength in pilots Hall that brought us salvation it wasn't even the cross itself that brought us salvation all of these things were very important in the overall picture and in God's plan for got Flynn the Savior bled and died none of these by themselves saves us and can save us and will ever be able to save us but it is the shed blood that saves us for the life the token was in the blood the life amen came out of the blood and is available to us in the form of the Holy Spirit that token of the Living God now let me put this to you my brothers and sisters that if a cross could save us then we could then have someone come and deceive us by causing us to place our attention on the cross itself while ignoring the person who died on the cross so it's not the cross itself that we ought to Prater it's not the cross itself that we ought to look to for salvation this is a trick of Satan for the cross cannot save you whether it's on us it's made of gold or brass or wood or what do you have it in your neck or it's in there it's in the front of the church or on the wall of the church that cross is only a symbol it cannot save you it's not one who died upon the cross for you that Saints it's Jesus that says oh hear the joyful sound here today Jesus saves Jesus Saves tell this this word all around let me have talk around the town get beat among all people over the hills and over the mountains that Jesus Saves Jesus Saves and that he alone can provide you salvation for your sins again what can wash away my sins nothing but the blood of Jesus Oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow what Oh brothers and sisters nothing but the blood of Jesus nothing can force in atone nothing but the blood of Jesus not of good that I have done nothing but the blood of Jesus Oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow it is not the cross that saves us present sisters it is not our good works that save us it's not our generous offerings to the church that saves us we cannot find salvation we cannot pay Saint Peter at the door we cannot pay for the forgiveness of sins only Jesus Saints only Jesus can give us salvation only he has the keys to open the death hell and the grave he is the only one who said I all the key of David eyes shut and no man opens and I open and no man can shut it oh praise be to God Jesus Saves jesus says oh the cross cannot save your works cannot save that all your all your wonderful good charitable giving cannot save you it was nothing blood the blood of Jesus the perfect sacrifice that gave his life for us it was the blood of Jesus the Lamb of God not bloody bleeding dear lambdai precious blood shall never lose its power Oh till all the rents of Church of God are saved to sin no more it is the blood of Jesus that saves us and nothing else not the blood of Jesus and this or that added on but the blood of Jesus saves us I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me Jesus died upon the cross and I knew it was the blood for me no one can have a claim that they have a part in your salvation or even in their own salvation it is only through the grace of God and a blood of the Lamb that we are saved here today by the washing of the water of the Holy Spirit that is what Jesus said drinkie all of it drink ehome of it taking all of my life taking all of my word receive it within your heart believe it I want to receive all of that Jesus Christ has to give here today and

me clean totally I want to be whiter than snow I don't want any sin to be left with in my heart but I want to serve Him and love him with gratitude within my heart thanks be to God thank you Jesus for

pearly gates and come to this sin-sick world to save us from our sins to take away our sufferings and return us back to glory yes sir John 3:16 says for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should have eternal life yes sir I thank him that he loved me when I was unlovable when there was no good in me while we were yet sinners the scriptures say Christ died for our sins but thank God for His grace and mercy as the all Pentecostal song says His grace and mercy has brought me true amen hallelujah I live today because of you it is His grace that brought us thus far picked us up from the gutter most and piss us into the uttermost teeka's from the ghetto and put us in the ghetto here we are the day by the grace of God washed by his

given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body broken for you do this in remembrance of me believers let us take the bread let us thank God for providing this bread but while we're taking God for this natural bread think beyond that we are thanking God for the broken seals upon the word that released his life to come back upon us as it happened on Calvary it released the Holy Spirit to come back upon your posses in our day the opening of the word provides the token the Holy Spirit to come upon us and here is a symbol of his broken body as you hold it in your hand at this time let us partake together of the bread that represents the broken body of our Lord Jesus Christ in the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this
