[0:00] [Music]
[0:13] good evening friends
[0:15] once again we are gathered together for
[0:19] a marvelous and wonderful Bible study as
[0:23] I teach on the Word of God and made a
[0:26] great holy spirit anoint the Word of God
[0:29] to our the heirs of our hearts and to
[0:34] the eyes of our understanding let us
[0:39] pray our gracious God and Heavenly
[0:43] Father we ask thy blessing upon this
[0:47] life word today made a great Holy Spirit
[0:51] take praise honor and glory in the name
[0:56] of Jesus Christ our Lord amen and amen
[1:03] as we said before our subject tonight
[1:08] will be the believers rest and my aim is
[1:17] to show you that there is no rest there
[1:21] is no peace until our satisfaction until
[1:27] we come to a place a condition a zone in
[1:32] which we live in continuous inner rest
[1:39] inner wrist may God bless our hearts
[1:44] today as we sink upon these things now
[1:50] first of all we find that there are
[1:55] wonderful brothers and sisters in Christ
[2:00] that call the Lord's Day the Sabbath day
[2:05] or Saturday they believe it's Saturday
[2:11] then there are other wonderful Justice
[2:16] wonderful wonderful fine folks that will
[2:20] call Sunday the Lord's Day the first day
[2:26] of the week now we understood stand it
[2:31] could not be either one of these days or
[2:36] even if we were to put those two days
[2:38] together Saturday and Sunday they still
[2:43] will not be really and truly the Lord's
[2:49] Day for we know that John was in the
[2:53] spirit and he was in the spirit over a
[2:57] period of about receiving visions over a
[3:01] period of about two years ninety five
[3:07] eighty to ninety six eighty and actually
[3:13] what happened is that John was caught up
[3:17] in the spirit he was transported by the
[3:25] Holy Spirit transported into the future
[3:29] by the Holy Spirit God's time capsule or
[3:35] like Captain Kirk was beamed up God
[3:40] beamed him or transported him
[3:44] spiritually into the future so that he
[3:51] could come back and John write these
[3:55] things in a book and so John was able to
[3:59] write his visions his experiences while
[4:03] he was caught up in the spirit of God
[4:07] and transported into a future day the
[4:13] Lord's Day that is in the future because
[4:17] we know the Bible tells us that the
[4:20] Lord's Day is coming
[4:23] God's Day is coming and John is seeing
[4:29] those things of that future date
[4:33] meanwhile we are here now in some of
[4:38] that future that John was speaking about
[4:41] and the question is that we want to find
[4:47] out exactly what is the Sabbath day
[4:51] today
[4:52] what is it today when we know that the
[4:57] Sabbath from the New Testament is not
[5:01] the keeping of a certain day
[5:04] let me repeat we know from the New
[5:07] Testament and the teachings of the
[5:10] Apostles that the Sabbath day is not a
[5:16] certain date now in the book of Hebrews
[5:20] chapter 4 verses 8 9 and 10
[5:27] let's read from verse 9 there remaineth
[5:32] therefore I rest for the people of God
[5:37] for he that is entered into his rest he
[5:44] also has ceased from his old works as
[5:48] God did from his may god help us to
[5:54] cease from our fleshly Whirley works and
[6:00] our human efforts and to learn how to
[6:05] rest in the blessed holy spirit who has
[6:09] come to lead us to guide us to
[6:12] straightness encourages comfort us and
[6:15] to take us all the way from earth to
[6:19] glory rest upon him
[6:21] back there they had the pillar of fire
[6:24] they could see with their eyes but now
[6:27] he talked also told us clearly that he
[6:31] will go away
[6:32] what book return in the form of the
[6:34] blessed Holy Spirit our eyes may not be
[6:38] able to see him but we love him with our
[6:41] hearts
[6:41] and he promised even though you would
[6:43] see me I'll be with you even in you to
[6:48] the very end of the age so here we are
[6:52] friends
[6:53] Hebrew Hebrews tells us clearly that the
[6:58] this rest when one enters into this rest
[7:03] he ceases from his labors
[7:07] now the key phrase there is God ceased
[7:13] from his own works
[7:16] no God gave Israel the nation of Israel
[7:20] this seven-day for their Sabbath or
[7:26] Saturday if we want to call it that God
[7:29] gave Israel the seventh day as their
[7:34] seventh now and that was in
[7:39] commemoration for them to remember or as
[7:43] a memorial that he created the world
[7:48] over that period of time and that he
[7:53] rested from his own works and if he
[7:58] rested then they ought to rest now we
[8:04] know clearly friends that this Sabbath
[8:07] date was given to Israel as a memorial
[8:12] to commemorate God's work it was not
[8:15] given to the Gentiles as a commemoration
[8:19] of his works but it was given unto the
[8:23] Jewish brethren as a memorial to God and
[8:29] his great works of creation now we find
[8:36] friends that when God had finished
[8:38] creating when he has cease from his
[8:43] labors then he rested and so it was fine
[8:48] to give a day as of rest to his people
[8:54] in
[8:55] Oriol of that for at that time the
[8:59] people in number were few in the world
[9:02] and they had to they were in one place
[9:07] one area one timezone and so God could
[9:13] designate to Israel one day as a day of
[9:19] rest but of course with natural
[9:23] argumentation we understand that the
[9:26] world is now many many time zones and
[9:29] when it's that Saturday or the Sabbath
[9:32] day or whatever on a certain part of the
[9:36] world then it's not in several other
[9:38] parts and that will create a form of
[9:42] confusion but that's just normal natural
[9:46] argument but what does the Bible say
[9:48] about it the Bible tells us that he that
[9:53] is entered into his rest he who was
[9:58] entered into his rest or the rest that
[10:01] Jesus Christ gives it's not a date but
[10:06] it is an eternal rest in which God is
[10:09] giving us an eternal Sabbath in other
[10:13] words we understand that the seventh day
[10:17] is but a type of the eternal seven for
[10:23] sin with my friends is a number of
[10:27] completion it is the number of a new
[10:33] beginning so 7 or Saturday or the
[10:38] Sabbath day that was given to the Jews
[10:41] is a symbol of completion it a type of
[10:48] Sunday type of the resurrection is a
[10:52] symbol of a new week a new beginning
[10:57] it's a new beginning
[10:59] so what days have their significance in
[11:04] the natural now so we see God
[11:08] could not give us any certain one day in
[11:11] a natural a week as a day of rest but
[11:17] when we remain until you come into his
[11:21] rest we enter that rest we remain in
[11:24] that rest now Israel of course work
[11:28] we're able to enter into but could not
[11:32] remain in that rest because that they
[11:35] will be passive if it's one day that
[11:37] they will be pass and then they go back
[11:39] into restlessness and they have to wait
[11:41] for another week and then they go back
[11:44] into a rest and then they go back into
[11:47] restlessness because that was a one day
[11:51] affair they had back there but Jesus is
[11:56] saying that he who has the Bible is
[11:59] saying who he who enters into this rest
[12:02] has ceased from his labors he would ever
[12:06] have to go back out and be restless a
[12:11] wandering soul a driftwood on the tides
[12:15] of time but one was entered into the
[12:19] rest of the Living God and there he has
[12:23] entered as the Sun rises I have entered
[12:26] the amen of rest I'll sail the white
[12:30] seas no more for Jesus is a rest may God
[12:34] help every one of us today to enter into
[12:37] God's eternal rest and to rest in his
[12:41] love his care praise God hallelujah amen
[12:46] no we don't want to go backwards for
[12:51] that seven-day that was given to Israel
[12:55] was a shadow a type a prefigure of the
[13:02] substance reality that was to come but
[13:08] I'm afraid that many of my beloved
[13:10] brethren
[13:11] Frank are going backwards they went back
[13:15] and holding on to the shadow they're
[13:18] holding onto the
[13:20] stitute instead of reaching out and
[13:23] taking a hold of the reality of the
[13:28] substance of the manifestation of the
[13:31] word of God and the application of the
[13:34] truth of the word of God to our day and
[13:38] to our age and time that God has given
[13:43] unto us now what a blessed singing is my
[13:47] beloved brethren for us to be like this
[13:50] great Apostle John whom the Bible said
[13:54] God the Lord Jesus loved John the
[13:58] Apostle and about two or three times we
[14:02] read in the Gospels he who Jesus loved
[14:06] John him who Jesus loved and one time it
[14:11] says and that disciple that lay upon
[14:14] Jesus bosom whose name was John or what
[14:19] a place for everyone to come and enter
[14:23] into this believers rest where we can
[14:26] rest our case or problem rester
[14:30] situation rest their trials rest our
[14:34] Technic lights our mental anguish our
[14:38] pain or depression or oppression if we
[14:41] can enter into that rest and rest ur
[14:44] heads upon Jesus breast or bosom not
[14:48] that presence bosom but rest in Jesus
[14:51] bosom rest in his care rest in the
[14:55] shadow of this great wings let him watch
[14:59] over us I will not leave you comfortless
[15:02] he said but I'll be with you I'll be
[15:05] even in you to the very end of the age
[15:09] and in that day they will know that I
[15:13] and the father are one and that I am in
[15:18] you and you and me and together we are
[15:21] one amen
[15:23] the oneness of God in his people how
[15:27] blessed
[15:28] how wonderful to know that as the tea
[15:32] cup of water from the ocean has the same
[15:36] properties as the water in the ocean
[15:39] itself praise combina be human but the
[15:42] soul that is in us never dies and is
[15:46] apart from the great oceans of God and
[15:49] we come from God like the tides of the
[15:52] sea and we got back to God to her
[15:54] original position how happy we should be
[15:58] brother sister that we can come for a
[16:01] place of rest and Christ and know that
[16:05] we are one in him there should be the
[16:08] name of the Lord amen so we know friends
[16:12] it is not the keeping of any day not
[16:17] Saturday nor Sunday and no matter I want
[16:21] to tell you this is an eternal rest for
[16:25] the rest my friends is that Blessed holy
[16:28] spirit of God's Sabbath within your soul
[16:33] let me send you it doesn't matter how
[16:37] long you have been laboring under your
[16:39] habits under your sin under your problem
[16:43] under your situation whether it is ten
[16:47] years thirty years fifty years or even
[16:50] longer Jesus is saying come come you
[16:55] weary cut all of you that are troubled
[16:59] thus dead those are the scarred those
[17:02] are the pros he is saying come and I
[17:05] will give you life I will give you rest
[17:08] if you come to me you will find rest
[17:12] Jesus said in the Gospels rest for your
[17:15] soul you will find rest in him the true
[17:20] Sabbath in other words is he himself for
[17:24] he said I will give you rest
[17:28] Jesus in you is your rest
[17:31] Christ in you your hope of glory that is
[17:35] your rest now you
[17:38] see the meat brothers rather segment
[17:39] what does that rest that Jesus will give
[17:43] what is that rest now it Isaiah 28 8 to
[17:48] 12 please listen
[17:50] excuse me we find that in the Word of
[17:54] God is that he said here in Isaiah the
[17:57] tables are full of vomit even some of
[18:01] the groups the churches are all messed
[18:04] up in other words and sometimes even in
[18:08] the building even in the community
[18:11] called the church a person may not be
[18:14] able to find rest there no clean place
[18:19] whom shall I teach knowledge whom shall
[18:23] be he made to understand the doctrine
[18:26] then that are weaned from milk and drawn
[18:31] away from press for precept must be upon
[18:34] precept line upon line here a little
[18:38] they were written for with stammering
[18:41] lips and that another term will I speak
[18:44] to these people to whom I said this is
[18:48] the rest this is the Sabbath where would
[18:51] you make caused the people to rest or
[18:55] keep the true Sabbath
[18:57] this is the refreshing yet they will not
[19:01] hear that would understand so here it is
[19:04] prophesied in Isaiah that the Holy
[19:07] Spirit coming into a life refreshing it
[19:11] invigorating it anointing it bring it to
[19:15] a big place of peace and a place of rest
[19:19] that he is the rest in our souls the
[19:24] true Sabbath of course is the person of
[19:28] Jesus Christ now in the form of the Holy
[19:32] Spirit God residing and resting within
[19:36] the human soul praise God for the Bible
[19:41] tells us in Acts chapter 2 how about
[19:45] there when they were filled with the
[19:47] the ghost the apostle cease from their
[19:50] worldly works they cease from their
[19:53] worldly doings this cease from any evil
[19:58] ways that they had and the Holy Ghost -
[20:02] charger their lives and they became the
[20:05] spawn said I am a prisoner of Jesus
[20:08] Christ because here it is that they
[20:12] surrender deadlines to him they rested
[20:16] in him and he did the acts are the works
[20:20] through them praise God hallelujah they
[20:25] entered into his rest there is the rest
[20:29] according to the Word of God there is
[20:32] the rest you need and I need according
[20:34] to this Bible that is the Sabbath we
[20:38] should put our faith and their trust in
[20:40] Jesus Christ himself spirit of the
[20:51] Living God amen it is you ceasing from
[20:55] your works your fleshly endeavors and to
[20:59] rest in the achievements and the
[21:03] overcoming of Jesus Christ himself and
[21:07] what God is doing and willing and acting
[21:12] and working through you furnish God
[21:16] that's working in you to do of his good
[21:19] pleasure and of his good will praise be
[21:23] to God hallelujah amen
[21:25] praise God now we understand that
[21:29] persons who worship on Saturday
[21:32] my friends claim that we meet on the
[21:36] wrong day of the week which is suddenly
[21:40] they believe that that's the wrong day
[21:42] of the week and that they are worshiping
[21:44] in the right knee of the week now I'm
[21:46] not saying anything against anyone that
[21:48] wants to worship God on Saturday that's
[21:52] you can wash it more than anything that
[21:54] you wish to worship him but don't
[21:58] impress on anyone
[22:00] Saturday is that day of rest and is the
[22:04] rest of God for it is not the rest is
[22:07] the Holy Spirit of the Living God and we
[22:11] want to rest on that the Saturday is not
[22:14] the rest spoken off we find that that
[22:16] Justin Martyr in a second century said
[22:20] on Sunday a meeting is held that they
[22:25] repeat he said on Sunday a meeting is
[22:29] held of all who live in the cities
[22:32] villages we read the memoirs of the
[22:36] Apostles and their writings as long as
[22:39] time permits when the reading is
[22:42] finished an exhortation is given to
[22:46] imitate those noble things after this we
[22:50] all arise and offer common prayer in the
[22:54] presence of God then the congregation
[22:57] says Amen after this the elements of
[23:01] distributed bread in the way we partake
[23:04] of that and then those that are upset
[23:07] the Deacons go to their homes and serve
[23:10] them that Lord supper and the wealthy
[23:14] then give gifts every one of us we
[23:17] receive a collection freewill and it's
[23:21] deposited later distributed to orphans
[23:24] widows prisoners and strangers and those
[23:28] that are in need
[23:29] praise God so we see even in the
[23:32] Apostles bustling times or even slightly
[23:36] after the apostles they did not keep the
[23:40] Jewish or Judaic tradition of assembling
[23:44] on the last day of the week but instead
[23:48] they were meeting on the first day of
[23:53] the week and it's not that they were
[23:55] grossly ignorant because they were men
[23:58] many of them most of them were men the
[24:00] Jews they were not ignorant they were
[24:03] well aware but they recognized there was
[24:05] a change from law to grace there was a
[24:09] change that we are not
[24:11] the law but we are under grace that was
[24:14] to the Jews now this in our day is to
[24:17] the Gentiles neither Saturday nor Sunday
[24:21] but to enter into the rest by being in
[24:26] filled by the Blessed Holy Spirit who
[24:29] comes to rest as the dove of peace
[24:32] within our souls and we in turn rest in
[24:36] him our peace hallelujah for years our
[24:40] peace and he has broken down every wall
[24:44] praise God hallelujah
[24:46] every wall between us and God he is
[24:50] broken on every wall and giving us rest
[24:53] and peace within our souls all that
[24:57] persons may come or that you may come to
[25:01] him my friend and find rest in him but
[25:05] there is a thirst there is a craving
[25:08] within the hearts of men but the
[25:11] majority my friends don't know the
[25:14] answer and so to steal their conscience
[25:19] to suppress their hunger they they and
[25:26] their hearts that is crying out for the
[25:29] conscience is speaking to them and cry
[25:31] out and they want to death they want to
[25:35] dull the cry their hearts cry and the
[25:39] cry their soul so they give up my
[25:42] friends go into drinking they going to
[25:46] smoking they're going to carouse and
[25:49] partying busying themselves with
[25:52] business running to and fro and all of
[25:55] this activity is trying to shake off the
[25:59] voice of the conscience that's so much
[26:02] speaking to them and telling them to to
[26:05] cease their human labor and find a place
[26:09] of rest in Jesus Christ all my friends
[26:13] they grew up there and tried to engage
[26:16] in every physical acts
[26:19] cess of sensuality promiscuity lying
[26:23] stealing backbiting and such things and
[26:27] ends up there is no inner rest there is
[26:31] no rest there is no peace until you let
[26:35] the Lord Jesus Christ come in and give
[26:38] you his glorious remedy the remedy is
[26:42] not smoking the remedy is not pills the
[26:47] sleeping pills the remedy is not drugs
[26:51] it's none of those things their remedy
[26:54] wealth is given to you by the great
[26:58] physician Jesus Christ himself who said
[27:02] the Scriptures are there is a balm in
[27:05] Gilead
[27:05] that makes the woman spirits all come
[27:10] unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
[27:13] laden and I will give you rest
[27:17] would you come to him now and let him
[27:20] give you rest and peace within your
[27:24] souls there is no rest from earthly
[27:27] pills or potions or or any medicines or
[27:32] capsules or vitamins my friends the rest
[27:36] comes from Jesus Christ and Christ alone
[27:39] what the world needs today above all
[27:42] else is Jesus Christ hallelujah they
[27:46] need God's heavenly remedy of the rest
[27:50] of the Holy Spirit all glory be to God
[27:54] my friends then we find the other group
[27:58] that insists will must go to church on
[28:00] Sunday one group in systems go on
[28:04] Saturday
[28:05] the seventh day one insist you must go
[28:08] on Sunday you know the eighth day or the
[28:12] first day again
[28:14] of the week see but Jesus said me
[28:18] neither they don't know how to approach
[28:20] God because the real approach to God is
[28:24] not here it's not there
[28:26] it's not on this day it's not on that
[28:29] night
[28:30] but the rest is in Christ hallelujah the
[28:35] true worship is the worship God we're in
[28:38] spirit and in truth
[28:42] hallelujah oh praise God John 4:24
[28:46] friends tells us get that kind of
[28:49] worship you only find it in Jesus Christ
[28:53] hallelujah amen
[28:55] oh praise God how can you find rest
[28:59] someone to a church how can you fight
[29:01] rest just in the church not to say the
[29:04] church is a is an aid the church is a
[29:07] community that can give you spiritual
[29:11] comfort and social support a social
[29:18] blanket a community of faith but friends
[29:22] the kind of church I'm talking about how
[29:25] can you find rest and peace in a church
[29:28] that will tell you you know God allows
[29:36] them to put up Santa Claus in the church
[29:39] God allows them to put up to Kevin bomb
[29:43] the Christmas trees in the church God
[29:47] allows them at Easter to have bunnies
[29:50] and eggs in the church how can you find
[29:54] peace in the place like that when it is
[29:57] not found in the Bible it is not found
[30:01] in the Word of God that is pain of
[30:04] worship that is speaking teaching it
[30:06] comes from the paganism and Christianity
[30:10] has blended paganism into Christianity
[30:14] or paganism has blended itself to
[30:19] deceive within the ranks of Christianity
[30:23] and many have find themselves entangled
[30:26] in its veins come out of her my people
[30:30] and be not partakers of her sins live
[30:35] that harlot and come to the Wonder
[30:39] well grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[30:41] Christ when one turns to the Lord one
[30:45] can find my friends then filling of the
[30:49] Holy Spirit and then you can cease from
[30:53] officially working up yourself
[30:56] struggling striving being tossed about
[30:59] not knowing what life is about not
[31:02] finding any purpose then when you come
[31:05] to him you'll find rest in your soul
[31:07] find your real purpose you'll really
[31:11] begin to live and to love God and to
[31:14] worship Him in spirit and in truth
[31:18] now let us recap briefly my friends
[31:21] let's get back here and see what God's
[31:24] Word says we know then in our final
[31:28] conclusion here that the Lord's Day is
[31:32] not Saturday nor is the Lord's Day
[31:38] Sunday you say well what is it my
[31:43] friends today is not the lord's day it's
[31:48] not the lord's age we are now living in
[31:52] the age of man or the time of man or our
[31:56] man's day or the day where men controls
[32:01] on the earth everything it's a day of
[32:06] man's works man science
[32:09] men trying to achieve men trying to
[32:12] build another Tower of Babel again man's
[32:16] doing this man's working men's church
[32:21] not God's church this man building up
[32:27] their vision their idea of what God's
[32:32] church should look like instead of going
[32:35] back to apps - and seeing God's original
[32:39] blueprint and pattern and build on work
[32:43] according to God's commands and God's
[32:46] blueprint that he has laid
[32:48] in his word Oh blessed be his name but
[32:52] God's blueprint seemed strange two men
[32:56] today it doesn't seem so ordered
[32:58] systematic theologies and systematize
[33:02] they they don't see it that way they
[33:05] have to have what they think is his
[33:08] proper administration's orders and
[33:11] things all lined up like that and I love
[33:14] themselves to be clearly being able to
[33:17] track trackin and being able to be
[33:19] anticipated their every action by no
[33:22] bite Satan when the Bible says the sons
[33:25] our daughters of God are led by the
[33:28] Spirit of God and the wind blows where
[33:31] it lists and no man made those miracles
[33:34] it seems as if there is no order in the
[33:37] way the wind moves or the Holy Spirit
[33:39] moves but God knows his own doings and
[33:44] his own ways and his own orders as the
[33:48] scripture of the songwriter said our God
[33:51] moves in a mysterious way his wonders to
[33:54] perform he plans his footsteps on the
[33:57] seat and he rides upon the storm oh what
[34:00] a blessing blessing what a mighty God we
[34:04] serve something no it's a day of man's
[34:07] ideas about everything
[34:10] man's works man's everything man's idea
[34:14] of how we should worship God when God
[34:18] has plainly given us in his work no
[34:21] matter how beautiful our worship
[34:23] Oh wonderful it sounds if you're not in
[34:26] the spirit it's a camus watch it though
[34:30] can had every beautiful thing that altar
[34:32] Cain was religious he was crying of all
[34:36] God God of course is an object of
[34:39] worship that's not the name of anybody
[34:41] but it will have a revelation and you
[34:44] who he watch it let's come back to the
[34:47] Word of God and have a recognition and a
[34:50] revelation of who we truly worship may
[34:53] God help every one of us today but thank
[34:56] God when men's Day is over that day the
[34:59] Lord is coming I
