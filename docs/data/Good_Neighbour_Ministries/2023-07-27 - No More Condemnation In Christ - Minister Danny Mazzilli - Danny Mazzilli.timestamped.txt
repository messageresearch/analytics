[21:13] forevermore amen
[21:15] so tonight we'll be we'll be looking at
[21:17] the book of Romans

[21:39] believeth on him that sent me hath
[21:42] everlasting life
[21:44] and shall not come into condemnation
[21:48] but is passed from death unto life
[21:52] Romans chapter 8 verse 1 says there is
[21:55] therefore now no condemnation to them
[21:59] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[22:03] after the flesh
[22:04] but after the spirit let us pray our
[22:08] gracious Heavenly Father
[22:10] we're grateful tonight Lord that we can
[22:12] surround
[22:14] ourselves in your presence oh God lord
[22:17] knowing that your anointing is in our
[22:20] midst once again Lord to minister to
[22:23] each and every need in our midst father
[22:26] Lord we ask that your spirit would come
[22:28] and bring Liberty in our midst oh God
[22:32] let your words bring forth life let it
[22:36] transform our hearts and our minds oh
[22:39] God Lord because we know that your word
[22:42] is spirit and life
[22:44] we need it like the breath that we
[22:49] breathe here on this Earth Lord it is
[22:51] more precious to us than anything else
[22:54] father
[22:55] we so appreciate what you're doing Lord
[22:58] bless each and every one Lord that are
[23:01] listening in from YouTube tonight father
[23:04] wherever they may be all the saints all
[23:07] over lord may your spirit go and just
[23:10] speak to their hearts and their lives
[23:12] and meet needs oh God and Lord we just
[23:15] would never fail but to give you the
[23:17] praise the glory and all the honor in
[23:20] Jesus name amen
[23:22] praise God
[23:25] I forgot to grab a bottle of water if
[23:28] somebody could just grab some water I'd
[23:29] appreciate that amen praise God
[23:32] Hallelujah
[23:34] no more condemnation in Christ
[23:38] praise God hallelujah
[23:41] The Book of Romans is probably one of
[23:44] the
[23:46] most amazing
[23:48] books of the New Testament it is a book
[23:51] that basically reveals how God you know
[23:56] shows us that we go from no condemnation
[24:00] to no separation
[24:02] when you look at the book of Romans if
[24:04] you read chapter 7 you know when you go
[24:07] home tonight or sometime this week I
[24:10] encourage you to read Romans chapter 7
[24:13] and chapter 8 and you're gonna read it
[24:17] in a little different light you're going
[24:19] to see things a little clearer you're
[24:22] going to see that you are human that you
[24:25] did not
[24:27] um you know
[24:28] by your experience as a Christian and
[24:31] receiving the word of God yes you have
[24:33] been transformed you've been renewed in
[24:36] your mind but yet you've come to realize
[24:38] also that you're still living in this
[24:41] flesh this body of clay and that you are
[24:45] still susceptible to many things amen
[24:48] praise God but you know one one of the
[24:51] most wonderful things about the book of
[24:53] Romans
[24:55] is that within the book of Romans
[24:57] chapter 8 there's over 19 different
[25:01] times where the holy spirit is named
[25:04] it's like the the book of the Holy
[25:06] Spirit and how the holy spirit is so
[25:10] real and how relevant and how important
[25:13] it is
[25:14] to know that the spirit of God uh the
[25:17] attribute of God the Awakening of that
[25:20] attribute you may be seated how that the
[25:22] The Awakening of the attribute of God
[25:25] and how the spirit of God in you is is
[25:29] so powerful it is what makes everything
[25:33] so real in your ability to serve God
[25:36] because if you didn't have that
[25:38] understanding of you know greater is he
[25:41] that is in you than he that's in the
[25:44] world you'd be under condemnation all
[25:46] the time
[25:47] before you came to the Lord as a matter
[25:50] of fact you know even if you were a
[25:53] so-called Christian
[25:54] you were constantly under condemnation
[25:57] because you constantly found yourself in
[26:00] sin and unbelief no matter how much you
[26:02] tried to be you know a good person uh no
[26:07] matter how much you tried not to gossip
[26:08] no matter how much you try you know to
[26:11] do your best and to be honest you know
[26:13] you start out the day and you say Lord
[26:15] today I'm gonna do my best I'm gonna I'm
[26:18] not gonna do this I'm not gonna do that
[26:20] and by 10 o'clock you're doing this and
[26:23] by 12 o'clock you're doing that
[26:25] and you're finding yourself uh you know
[26:28] being under the spirit of condemnation
[26:30] praise God but then you come to realize
[26:34] that you're a Son of God through a
[26:37] message for your day you actually come
[26:40] into contact with the supernatural
[26:43] Living God the one that you heard about
[26:45] the one that you read about the one that
[26:48] you heard people talk about and you
[26:50] thought maybe you knew that that he was
[26:52] a reality but he was not a reality until
[26:55] he became and made himself real to you
[26:59] personally
[27:01] then everything changed then you came to
[27:05] realize that there was hope you came to
[27:07] realize that you were not just a human
[27:10] being born into this world born in a
[27:13] sinful flesh and a sinful under a sinful
[27:16] nature you came to realize that there's
[27:19] something that happens
[27:21] supernaturally when the message of the
[27:24] hour
[27:25] this is so important to realize the
[27:27] message of the hour which is Jesus
[27:30] Christ himself in the present stage of
[27:35] his ministry when he now makes himself
[27:39] real to you reveals himself to you you
[27:42] hear that there's that that God sent the
[27:45] prophet you know maybe when you first
[27:47] heard that it just didn't quite sit
[27:50] right but let me remind you and
[27:53] everybody else
[27:54] that when Jesus or when any other
[27:58] prophet of the Old Testament came on the
[28:01] scene it was always the exact same way
[28:05] they could not receive that Prophet they
[28:09] would not receive him they would not
[28:11] recognize that it was actually God in
[28:15] his day manifesting the portion of the
[28:19] word that he wanted to fulfill in that
[28:22] day
[28:23] you talk to somebody about God sending a
[28:26] prophet they're not going to believe it
[28:29] why because 99 of the people whenever a
[28:36] prophet came on the scene they didn't
[28:38] believe it they wouldn't accept it so
[28:42] it's perfectly normal for somebody to
[28:45] not believe that God sent a prophet in
[28:48] the 20th century amen the mighty Prophet
[28:52] The Mighty God the the Elohim the
[28:55] self-existent one made himself flesh
[28:58] came to the Earth spoke in amongst the
[29:01] common people but how many recognized
[29:04] that he was who he said he was
[29:08] a dozen people
[29:09] when he was here on the Earth
[29:12] so it's not unusual to to uh you know to
[29:17] testify to somebody tell them that God
[29:20] sent the prophet that you know it's not
[29:22] unusual for them to reject it or or uh
[29:26] you know disbelieve it or be very
[29:29] skeptical skeptical about it It's
[29:31] Perfectly Natural for that to happen why
[29:34] because it takes the supernatural God
[29:38] himself to reveal himself to the
[29:43] individual personally to make it real to
[29:46] them and to open their understanding by
[29:50] the spirit of Revelation which which is
[29:54] the Holy Ghost
[29:56] amen which is God it's not three
[30:00] separate people it's the same self One
[30:03] and Only Living true God revealing
[30:06] himself
[30:07] in his appointed time and season to each
[30:12] individual that is to receive the word
[30:16] Jesus said no man comes to the father
[30:21] which is him in his
[30:24] ultimate
[30:26] Elohim self-existent one before the
[30:30] foundations of the world no one can come
[30:33] lest the father draws him
[30:36] draws him how by revealing himself to
[30:40] them by opening their understanding by
[30:44] giving them a divine revelation of his
[30:47] thoughts
[30:48] towards them about who they are in his
[30:54] mind in him amen all that the father
[30:59] hath given me he said will come not
[31:03] might come
[31:05] they will come amen praise God so we
[31:09] don't have to pull people into the
[31:12] gospel listen it wasn't God pulling you
[31:15] into the gospel
[31:17] it was God unveiling his word to you
[31:20] when he looked to Matthew who was a tax
[31:23] collector and Matthew he was not
[31:27] somebody that was liked he was not
[31:29] somebody that was popular he was very
[31:31] unpopular but when Jesus looked to him
[31:34] and spoke to him and said Matthew
[31:37] follow me
[31:39] something
[31:40] supernaturally was revealed to Matthew
[31:43] right there at that moment that was a
[31:46] lot more than just the words Matthew
[31:48] follow me
[31:50] it was the spirit of God writing that
[31:53] word directly into Matthew's heart
[31:57] revealing to him who he was and that he
[32:00] was no longer like he did with Peter he
[32:03] would no longer be a fisher of of fish
[32:06] he would become a a fisher of men he
[32:09] would become one of his disciples now
[32:12] the spirit of God would get into Peter
[32:14] and would be a disciple somebody that
[32:17] would go out there and share the word of
[32:20] God and speak the word of God just like
[32:22] you you're just an a normal person Peter
[32:25] was just a normal fisherman but God had
[32:28] a plan for Peter
[32:30] hallelujah praise God God had a plan for
[32:33] Paul
[32:34] was on the road to Damascus one day and
[32:37] he was on his way to go and kill
[32:39] Christians imagine he was murdering
[32:42] Christians he was out against God he
[32:46] didn't realize he was against God he
[32:48] didn't realize that the Messiah was
[32:50] Jesus Christ but one day God knocks him
[32:54] off his high horse this happens all in
[32:57] one moment all in one day
[33:00] so don't be afraid to share the word of
[33:03] God with anybody because you don't know
[33:04] when God is going to reveal himself make
[33:08] himself known to that individual it can
[33:11] happen just like that because he is the
[33:13] god that opens he's the god that shuts
[33:17] that's why you don't have to force
[33:19] nothing but hear Paul he was he was
[33:22] definitely riding on a high horse he was
[33:25] thinking that all that he was doing was
[33:26] was God's will the Lord's will you know
[33:30] to get rid of these Heretics these
[33:32] people that thought that they were
[33:34] special that they were called of God
[33:36] that they you know that they had a
[33:38] special mission that they were you know
[33:40] Christians and God knocks him right off
[33:43] his high horse knocks him on the ground
[33:46] and right there and then reveals himself
[33:49] right to Paul because Paul says who art
[33:52] thou Lord he says I am Jesus imagine so
[33:57] the lord of the Old Testament the one
[33:59] that he thought was God he didn't
[34:02] realize was now made flesh had come and
[34:06] you know started a Ministry on the earth
[34:09] fulfilling his word and his his plan
[34:12] they didn't realize that it was the
[34:14] Mighty God and he never knew it until
[34:17] God said it is I Jesus and right there
[34:20] he was given instruction what to do and
[34:23] he's the one that wrote This Book of
[34:25] Romans
[34:27] and you'll see you know as we go along
[34:30] we're going to do a study of this you
[34:33] know um because I I believe there's just
[34:35] so much in here that can strengthen us
[34:39] that can give us Victorious living amen
[34:42] praise God so let's go to the um to the
[34:45] next
[34:47] um
[34:48] slide here brother Branham in seed is
[34:51] not air with the shuck he says there is
[34:54] no judgment to the Royal spiritual
[34:57] predestinated Seed of Abraham for they
[35:01] are predestinated to eternal life
[35:05] eternal means having no beginning and no
[35:08] End Amen
[35:10] etern predestinated to eternal life
[35:12] means that you always were you were a
[35:17] son or a daughter of God you were an
[35:19] attribute of God there's never a time
[35:21] that you were not
[35:23] and you were predestinated to be
[35:26] awakened in this time and season here on
[35:31] this Earth amen they have accepted God's
[35:35] provided sacrifice and that sacrifice
[35:38] which is Christ
[35:40] the word and there is therefore now no
[35:44] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[35:46] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[35:50] after the spirit you and I we were all
[35:53] walking after the flesh
[35:56] and we still do on a daily basis walk
[36:00] after the flesh because we're in the
[36:02] flesh
[36:03] you can't change that until this Earthly
[36:07] Tabernacle be dissolved
[36:09] you are going to be in a in a constant
[36:12] struggle with this flesh amen and the
[36:16] flesh is going to pull you in certain
[36:18] ways because of the weakness of the
[36:20] flesh because you gotta you gotta sleep
[36:23] You Gotta Eat You Gotta you know you
[36:26] gotta deal with people you've got to
[36:28] deal with interrelationships and as
[36:31] human beings we are very weak we get
[36:34] tired and we have to deal with the
[36:37] things of the flesh but the beautiful
[36:39] thing about the word of God and the Holy
[36:42] Spirit coming into our lives is that now
[36:44] he takes over
[36:47] he takes over
[36:48] the spirit of God starts to direct Our
[36:51] Lives starts to give us inspiration
[36:54] starts to show us by the word of God
[36:56] that that's not who you really are
[36:59] this is who you really are you are an
[37:02] attribute of God you were with me from
[37:05] before the foundations of the world you
[37:07] got trapped into a Time body you came
[37:10] into this world and you went into
[37:12] spiritual Amnesia you lost your your
[37:16] your understanding through a flesh body
[37:19] and through a fleshly experience as a
[37:21] human you lost all of your understanding
[37:24] that you went into a spiritual Amnesia
[37:26] but it's okay I've awakened you now
[37:29] I've awakened your understanding I've
[37:32] opened your understanding and now you're
[37:34] not going to be led so much by that
[37:36] flesh you are going to be led by the
[37:38] spirit amen praise God and the next
[37:41] slide says God being misunderstood 1961
[37:44] he says no sir
[37:46] we do not stand before the Judgment we
[37:50] are now standing before the Judgment God
[37:53] put our sins upon Christ
[37:57] that's why you know
[37:59] it's so important for anybody to
[38:03] understand when it comes to Christ that
[38:06] all the sin and all the unbelief and all
[38:10] the things of your past you know
[38:13] um
[38:14] people they want to make everything
[38:16] right before they come to serve the Lord
[38:19] they think that they can make all their
[38:21] wrongs right
[38:23] but that's not how it works
[38:25] the only way that you can truly be
[38:28] liberated in Christ is when you place
[38:31] all of your sin on Christ
[38:34] because he took it to the cross for you
[38:38] he took your place he stood in the Gap
[38:43] when he went to Calvary and took all of
[38:46] our sin and unbelief
[38:48] and therefore it is not by your own
[38:51] righteousness it's not going to be by
[38:53] your own ways that you are going to
[38:55] serve God it's going to be because the
[38:58] spirit of God is going to take control
[39:00] and possess you and his life is going to
[39:03] live through you
[39:05] amen praise God
[39:07] you know
[39:09] when we look at the book of Romans okay
[39:12] because we're looking at our whole
[39:14] thought here is that there is no there
[39:17] is now no more condemnation we must come
[39:20] to a place where we walk with God to
[39:23] realize because especially now that
[39:25] we're in the Rapture season
[39:28] we're we're we're we're experiencing
[39:31] rapturing Faith this is all part of that
[39:34] series unrapturing faith that God is
[39:37] revealing and giving to us and it's not
[39:40] something you know that we want to make
[39:42] you know rapturing faith and we've got
[39:44] to make it something mysterious no it's
[39:48] as simple as God revealing to you
[39:52] by revelation
[39:54] that you are a son or daughter of God an
[39:57] attribute of God and that you were
[40:00] already
[40:01] prepared from before the foundations of
[40:04] the world to take a rapture
[40:07] you're predestinated for the body change
[40:11] you are that particular group that are
[40:15] going to be changed in the moment in the
[40:17] twinkling of an eye
[40:18] we are the ones that God has chosen and
[40:22] so it's important to understand that
[40:25] there's there's uh all these aspects of
[40:28] living that we have to deal with and
[40:31] there's there's there's three tremendous
[40:33] truths that we can draw from The Book of
[40:36] Romans
[40:37] and one of them is that there is a
[40:40] struggle in the Christian Life
[40:42] as long as you're living
[40:44] In the Flesh there's going to be a
[40:46] struggle
[40:48] there's going to be listen to Paul he
[40:49] says in my mind I want to please God but
[40:53] there is something in me that makes me
[40:55] want to do the opposite
[40:58] you know there's this struggle in our
[41:00] nature you know there's this this this
[41:03] constant battle over and over again he
[41:05] says that which I should I would do I do
[41:09] not that which I hate I do and we all
[41:13] understand that that
[41:15] this happens don't we understand that
[41:18] don't we experience those things you
[41:21] know that which I hate I do we all
[41:23] understand every single day you know we
[41:26] get up and we say Lord this is your day
[41:28] and I'm going to be your servant and do
[41:31] your will today
[41:33] you know everybody wants that you know
[41:35] that you know to start their day that
[41:37] way and then uh you know um Lord this is
[41:41] your day and then so we set our goal to
[41:44] accomplish a certain number of things
[41:45] and that we know we will be pleasing to
[41:48] God and then as we go through the day
[41:51] we don't do number one
[41:54] we halfway do number two we skip number
[41:57] three all the things that we wanted to
[41:59] do right
[42:01] and we get most of number four and we
[42:04] don't do number five at all then we say
[42:07] Lord with your help I'm not going to
[42:09] lose my temper and we lose it by 9 A.M
[42:15] these are these are realities
[42:18] of us as human beings you know and Paul
[42:22] you know like the book of Romans it
[42:25] brought out Paul's biography almost you
[42:28] know like when you read it when you read
[42:30] you know Romans 7 and Romans 8 read it
[42:33] carefully and listen to Paul and listen
[42:35] to what he's saying and listen how he's
[42:36] struggling you know he's struggling as a
[42:40] as a human being he realizes that that
[42:42] you know we're we're you know caught by
[42:45] sinful nature you know that you know
[42:48] there's things in this world that are
[42:50] constantly pulling on us amen and then
[42:54] you know uh we say Lord help me not to
[42:57] to gossip and by by 1 30 that day we've
[43:00] blown that one too
[43:02] you know or because you know somebody
[43:04] comes up to you and tells you about a
[43:07] co-worker and starts gossiping about
[43:09] that co-worker and all of a sudden
[43:11] you're starting to add your two cents to
[43:13] it and then you realize oh God
[43:15] here we go again you see you're dealing
[43:18] with the things of this flesh amen it's
[43:22] not easy praise God but we need to
[43:26] understand that
[43:28] God by giving us his spirit
[43:32] we've overcome
[43:34] by his spirit
[43:36] we don't overcome by our own ability
[43:39] we overcome by believing the word of God
[43:42] that's how we overcome
[43:44] we overcome by knowing that he's the one
[43:47] that's in US revealing himself and
[43:51] overcoming through us
[43:53] you know next slide
[43:56] for for the wages of sin is death but
[43:59] the gift of God is eternal life through
[44:01] Jesus Christ Our Lord we know that sin
[44:05] will bring forth death
[44:08] and sin there's only one sin
[44:11] and that is the disbelieving of God's
[44:13] word
[44:14] when you disbelieve God's word it's sin
[44:19] but but you see he's he's he's giving us
[44:21] these thoughts here to tell us that
[44:26] we've been given something greater
[44:29] through Christ Jesus we've been given
[44:32] eternal life
[44:33] it's not something that that that has a
[44:36] beginning and has an end
[44:37] your salvation doesn't have a beginning
[44:39] and have an end
[44:41] amen your salvation has no beginning and
[44:45] has no end
[44:47] it's as simple as that and so we don't
[44:49] fall under that
[44:52] but yet next slide first John 1 8-9 if
[44:57] we say that we have no sin we deceive
[44:59] ourselves and the truth is not in US you
[45:03] see it's understanding you can't have an
[45:06] unbalanced walk you can't be walking
[45:09] around in the world and saying I can do
[45:11] whatever I want I don't care whatever I
[45:13] do I can't sin because I'm a Son of God
[45:16] I'm a daughter of God I don't make
[45:19] mistakes
[45:20] if you got that kind of an attitude then
[45:22] you haven't even got a revelation
[45:25] of the word of God Amen but if we
[45:28] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[45:31] to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[45:34] from all unrighteousness and so the
[45:37] balance is understanding that you are
[45:40] walking in the flesh
[45:42] but you are a son of God you will make
[45:46] mistakes you will say things that are
[45:49] wrong but you need to confess your sins
[45:52] you need to make those things right so
[45:54] that you can move on and not come under
[45:57] the spirit of condemnation
[46:00] because the Paradox is that there is now
[46:03] no condemnation but yet how many of us
[46:06] experience it from time to time when we
[46:09] make mistakes we feel that conviction in
[46:12] our heart we feel that condemnation in
[46:14] our heart because we're falling in under
[46:17] that same you know routine you're
[46:20] falling under you know because you're
[46:22] you're you're a creature of habits
[46:25] you're a human being so as a human being
[46:27] you're a creature of habits you're gonna
[46:29] you're gonna get caught into a habitual
[46:32] way of life but what happens as we grow
[46:36] in Christ that nature starts to break
[46:39] that that power of Habitual you know
[46:44] habitually falling back into disbelief
[46:47] falling back into sin that has to be
[46:50] broken by Revelation only God can give
[46:53] you Revelation on overcoming those
[46:56] things amen it's not going to be by your
[46:59] own uh ability it's going to be by
[47:02] divine revelation only Revelation sets
[47:06] you completely free from condemnation
[47:12] no condemnation to them that are in
[47:15] Christ
[47:16] amen and to be in Christ you know that
[47:19] you are an attribute of God you've been
[47:22] washed you've been Sanctified you've
[47:25] been Justified as though you've never
[47:27] done it in the first place you see
[47:29] that's the whole paradox
[47:30] of living this life amen praise God next
[47:35] slide Christ took our judgment he took
[47:38] it all
[47:39] we need to these are simple truth Saints
[47:43] we're doing a Bible study so that we can
[47:46] understand and it's not you know I know
[47:48] we've all heard these things we've all
[47:50] read these things but we need to
[47:52] understand that there's a lot of people
[47:54] out there that have not heard these
[47:56] things
[47:57] and they are looking for a way to be set
[48:00] free
[48:01] because a lot of people are living in
[48:03] bondage even in this message
[48:05] there's people that are living in
[48:07] bondage because they don't have a true
[48:11] and clear revelation of who they are
[48:14] amen praise God what is it it's God's
[48:17] representative of judgment Christ
[48:20] already judged for your sins Christ
[48:24] already judged for your Temptation
[48:26] Christ already judged for your sickness
[48:30] see what I mean everything that you you
[48:34] know you you find yourself making
[48:36] mistakes you find yourself you know
[48:39] falling short from time to time all
[48:42] those things they were already judged
[48:45] you're not being judged
[48:47] you yourself
[48:49] have already been judged because you're
[48:51] in Christ
[48:54] but you as a human being
[48:57] conscious and and in having this carnal
[49:00] nature
[49:01] you need to be aware of your attitude
[49:05] your your ways of doing things your ways
[49:08] of living you know you need to be
[49:10] conscious of those things so that you
[49:12] don't fall into the traps of the enemy
[49:14] because the enemy is constantly trying
[49:16] to set us up to be trapped into getting
[49:21] into condemnation getting into a
[49:23] backslidden condition getting us away
[49:26] from God by using those those little
[49:28] foxes that spoil the vine the little
[49:31] mistakes that we make from time to time
[49:33] the things that we do that we know we
[49:36] shouldn't do like Paul says
[49:38] amen praise God
[49:42] next slide judgment begins where at the
[49:45] house of God by the word of God Amen
[49:48] this is where we receive the word of God
[49:51] this is how we receive Deliverance by
[49:54] the power of God the church is the
[49:57] Judgment seat judgment begins in the
[50:00] house of God Amen praise God the church
[50:03] is the Judgment when we come into the
[50:05] house of the Lord and the spirit of God
[50:07] gets on the on the minister and starts
[50:09] to minister the word via the five-fold
[50:12] ministry we are receiving the word of
[50:14] God that liberates us from being under
[50:17] that Spirit of condemnation
[50:20] now the Holy Spirit starts to speak to
[50:22] us that's why assembling ourselves and
[50:25] and coming into the house of the Lord
[50:27] and feeding on the word of God is so
[50:30] important for us to to assemble and to
[50:33] and to come together because it's there
[50:35] where the Holy Spirit speaks to our
[50:37] needs it's there where the holy spirit
[50:40] gives us Revelation on Deliverance on
[50:43] the situations in our lives when we come
[50:45] with that sincerity in our hearts when
[50:47] we come with expectation to know that
[50:50] that you're still growing that you're
[50:52] still maturing in Christ that you're
[50:55] you're doing you're doing all that you
[50:57] can to grow in Christ
[50:59] and doing uh what we know we we should
[51:03] do is what is how we get blessed
[51:06] we know that we need to come and
[51:09] assemble ourselves in the house of the
[51:10] Lord
[51:11] we know that it benefits us we know that
[51:13] we're that when we do that we receive
[51:16] the spirit of God and when the spirit of
[51:18] God speaks to our needs Deliverance
[51:20] takes place in our lives amen praise God
[51:23] listen to brother Branham
[51:26] in things that are to be he says Lord
[51:29] Jesus we humbly come confessing our
[51:32] wrongs we need to submit ourselves to
[51:36] the spirit of God we come confessing
[51:38] that we are worthy of sickness and death
[51:41] and sorrow but we are accepting your
[51:45] propitiation for our sins and our
[51:48] sickness and tonight these Sons and
[51:51] Daughters of God setting here hearing
[51:54] the correction of the word and raising
[51:57] their hands and wanting a closer walk
[52:00] they're laying hands on one another now
[52:03] because they believe your word to be
[52:06] true
[52:07] they believe that we're now risen with
[52:10] Christ setting in Heavenly places
[52:13] in Christ Jesus amen praise God
[52:18] forevermore
[52:19] and so in order for us to really come to
[52:24] God we need to come God's provided way
[52:27] we need to we need to come through the
[52:30] blood of Jesus Christ
[52:32] and you know
[52:34] as a new Christian
[52:36] um
[52:37] they need to understand how to get to
[52:40] the place of no condemnation
[52:43] it starts with them coming into a
[52:46] relationship with God it comes by them
[52:49] coming to know God in the power of his
[52:53] resurrection
[52:55] and then they come to the place where
[52:57] they realize that everything that
[53:00] they've done as
[53:03] up until the time that they've met God
[53:07] it all is
[53:10] worthless
[53:12] everything that
[53:14] you did all the things that you thought
[53:18] were right
[53:19] everything you got to come to a place
[53:22] where you fully repent
[53:25] and it starts by them recognizing just
[53:29] like you know when you first came to the
[53:31] Lord you wanted to be baptized
[53:34] you needed to repent you needed to come
[53:37] according to Acts 2 38.
[53:40] you came to realize that there was no
[53:42] other way that you were going to receive
[53:44] the spirit of God you see these are
[53:47] these are the processes of coming to God
[53:50] the simple things that we do in order to
[53:53] come to God and the prescription is in
[53:56] Acts 2 38.
[53:58] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[54:02] baptized every one of you in the name of
[54:05] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[54:07] and you shall receive the gift of the
[54:11] Holy Ghost
[54:12] now as simple as that sounds
[54:17] it is the prescription
[54:20] for every son and daughter of God
[54:22] when they come to realize the spirit of
[54:25] God has called them
[54:28] it starts with baptism
[54:32] a lot of people say oh well you know I
[54:34] was baptized as a baby
[54:37] babies cannot believe the word of God
[54:42] babies cannot repent
[54:44] you have to repent
[54:47] in order to truly
[54:50] receive the spirit of God it says repent
[54:53] and be baptized every one of you in the
[54:57] name of Jesus Christ
[54:59] not in the names of the father and of
[55:01] the son and of the Holy Spirit
[55:04] we don't believe in a trinity
[55:07] we believe in one God
[55:10] and so in order to be properly
[55:13] scripturally baptized you need to be
[55:16] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:19] Christ
[55:20] then you shall receive the gift of the
[55:24] Holy Ghost
[55:25] amen praise God so you talk to people
[55:29] and you you know I actually met somebody
[55:31] today you know I was doing a delivery
[55:34] for a customer today
[55:35] and um
[55:38] as I was uh you know there I had my my
[55:40] worker unloading the load it was a load
[55:43] of sod for a customer and so
[55:46] um I overheard the owner of the home
[55:49] talking to
[55:51] a couple a woman and a young man and and
[55:54] then I could hear him talking about the
[55:56] word of God and saying yeah but God is
[55:59] one God you know and and it just caught
[56:02] my attention and I slowly walked over
[56:04] because I talked to the owner before
[56:07] that and it was on the second load that
[56:09] we were going there and uh and I
[56:12] realized oh this is Jehovah Witness
[56:15] you know testifying to the man but this
[56:17] this gentleman you know he was a
[56:20] gentleman maybe about 70 73 years old
[56:23] and uh you know but but he had he had a
[56:26] revelation on the Oneness of God and he
[56:29] was trying to explain that to the to the
[56:32] person you know and then I kind of
[56:34] slowly walked up and I said praise God
[56:36] brother that's nothing but the truth you
[56:40] know that's the truth God is one God you
[56:43] know it was like when you know and then
[56:45] we started talking and then the woman
[56:46] you know she was there and she was
[56:48] nodding her head and you know we don't
[56:51] believe in in uh you know in uh the
[56:54] Mighty God and then the almighty God we
[56:56] believe in Elohim the self-existent one
[56:59] and I got to testifying about the
[57:01] Oneness of God and you know we were
[57:04] talking about how God you know when
[57:07] Jesus made when when God was made flesh
[57:09] in Jesus he was here on the earth and uh
[57:13] he was Emmanuel he was God made flesh
[57:16] the word in the beginning was the word
[57:19] and the Word was with God and the Word
[57:21] was God
[57:23] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[57:26] Among Us and I said who was that and and
[57:30] the gentleman was saying that was God I
[57:33] said exactly God is one the Old
[57:36] Testament Jehovah is Jesus of the New
[57:39] Testament and you know and then so
[57:41] finally the woman and the young man they
[57:43] finally you know they realized that they
[57:45] had met their match you know and so they
[57:48] just nicely in a very nice way they said
[57:51] well you know uh
[57:54] praise God you know you know the Lord is
[57:57] good this and that and and she ended up
[58:00] leaving and and we said God bless you
[58:02] Sister may the Lord continue to open
[58:04] your understanding and you know because
[58:06] it takes the spirit of God to reveal
[58:09] himself to you it's not something that
[58:13] we learn that we teach ourselves that
[58:16] you know you can study the scriptures
[58:18] and that's good it's good to study the
[58:20] scriptures but it's a lot greater when
[58:23] the Holy Spirit himself comes and he
[58:26] says Ah he says I will send you the
[58:29] comforter Jesus said I will send you the
[58:31] comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he
[58:35] will guide you into all truth and the
[58:37] Holy Spirit can never go against his own
[58:40] word
[58:41] it can never happen
[58:42] Well the lady left there with the young
[58:45] man and then I was standing there and
[58:47] you know talking to the to the gentleman
[58:49] and I said I said so I said um are you
[58:53] Pentecostal and he says no he says uh uh
[58:56] I'm with the Brethren you know with the
[58:58] Brethren you know we believe
[59:00] uh in one God and and I said oh praise
[59:04] God that's wonderful I said you know I
[59:06] said it's wonderful to you know to
[59:08] Fellowship on the word of God and and to
[59:11] know that that when the Holy Spirit
[59:12] reveals himself because it takes God to
[59:16] really you know reveal his word to us
[59:19] personally in order for us to really
[59:21] know him
[59:22] and and I said uh so so uh how were you
[59:26] baptized he says oh I was baptized I was
[59:29] baptized fully immersioned into into
[59:32] water and I said yeah and how were you
[59:33] baptized like were you baptized in the
[59:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ he says no
[59:38] I was baptized in the name of the father
[59:40] and of the son and of the Holy Spirit
[59:42] and I said oh I said okay so I went to
[59:45] my my truck and I got the the track
[59:47] because I took a couple of the tracks
[59:49] that I saw the new tracks that we got
[59:52] here on baptism last Sunday and I put
[59:54] him in my truck
[59:56] and right away I remembered ah I got
[59:59] those tracks you know because they're
[1:00:01] really good
[1:00:02] and I said oh I said I want to share
[1:00:04] something with you you know I'd like you
[1:00:07] to read this and then I believe that
[1:00:09] you're gonna that you're gonna call me
[1:00:11] I believe that you're gonna you're gonna
[1:00:13] see something because I can see because
[1:00:15] while I was fellowshipping with him and
[1:00:17] we were talking about the word I could
[1:00:20] see that that he was responding there
[1:00:23] was an amen there there wasn't a
[1:00:24] resistance
[1:00:26] it was Amen to the word of God he would
[1:00:28] say yes that's true that's right every
[1:00:30] scripture that I would that I would
[1:00:31] quote he would say yes that's amen he
[1:00:33] would even finish the scripture you know
[1:00:36] uh and and so you could see that that
[1:00:39] there was something that was starting to
[1:00:40] take place there
[1:00:42] and so I left it with him and I said
[1:00:45] there's only one form of baptism and
[1:00:48] that is in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:49] Christ and when you've read this and
[1:00:51] you've taken some time and I also asked
[1:00:54] them to write down the name of William
[1:00:56] Miriam Branham I said he was an
[1:00:58] evangelist and a minister back in the
[1:01:01] 50s and 60s that I believe you know if
[1:01:05] you you get a chance you could listen to
[1:01:07] some of his sermons because there's some
[1:01:10] beautiful wonderful
[1:01:12] thoughts and tremendous Revelation
[1:01:15] coming from his ministry that you may
[1:01:17] find interesting
[1:01:19] not going to turn around and tell them
[1:01:21] oh he's the prophet of the 20th century
[1:01:24] if you don't believe that you're not
[1:01:26] gonna no it's not believing that brother
[1:01:28] Branham was the 20th century Prophet
[1:01:31] that saves anybody
[1:01:33] salvation is of the Lord
[1:01:36] is when the spirit of truth comes into
[1:01:39] you individually as a son or a daughter
[1:01:43] of God and God opens your understanding
[1:01:45] when you read the word when you listen
[1:01:48] to the prophet when you hear the the the
[1:01:51] preaching of the word it's because your
[1:01:53] understanding has been opened to receive
[1:01:56] Truth for your day
[1:02:00] and now all of a sudden it all makes
[1:02:03] sense
[1:02:04] everything makes sense praise God
[1:02:08] and so
[1:02:10] I love this opportunity that we can from
[1:02:14] you know on Wednesday nights we should
[1:02:16] try and focus on on uh you know I mean
[1:02:20] all the ministers should you know be led
[1:02:24] by the spirit and whatever the Lord lays
[1:02:26] upon their hearts but remember Wednesday
[1:02:28] nights are Bible study and we want to
[1:02:31] focus on some of the foundational truths
[1:02:34] of the word of God so that other people
[1:02:37] through the Simplicity of the word can
[1:02:40] receive Christ
[1:02:42] because remember it's not okay if you're
[1:02:46] an attribute of God you've got to come
[1:02:48] and be awakened to the word of God and
[1:02:51] you've got to come to your position in
[1:02:52] Christ but it takes that Awakening it
[1:02:55] takes that that season where God is
[1:02:57] going to do it for me it was you know
[1:02:59] going to see brother Gabriel and you
[1:03:02] know he gave me a tape and asked me if I
[1:03:05] was a Christian that was my time for you
[1:03:08] it was your time some of you were like
[1:03:11] brother Anthony's brought up in the
[1:03:12] message but then there came a certain
[1:03:14] time where the Holy Spirit decided now
[1:03:17] I'm going to place him I'm going to
[1:03:19] adopt him it's all in the Book of Romans
[1:03:22] everything that you know that we're
[1:03:25] talking about here tonight you know
[1:03:27] we're going to be looking at a lot more
[1:03:28] of it we're just looking at a little bit
[1:03:30] here tonight and uh we're using it as a
[1:03:34] platform to be like a a way of of
[1:03:37] getting this message out
[1:03:40] getting the word for our day into the
[1:03:44] hearts of the people but there's they
[1:03:46] need to come to their own repentance
[1:03:48] they need to come to their own
[1:03:50] experience with Christ
[1:03:52] they need to but it only comes by
[1:03:54] hearing the word faith cometh by hearing
[1:03:57] the word and the word is not just the
[1:04:00] word when you read and just say the word
[1:04:03] the word is when the spirit of God rides
[1:04:06] the word into the hearts of each and
[1:04:09] every individual
[1:04:11] amen praise God hallelujah
[1:04:14] and so
[1:04:16] you know I'm just gonna close here very
[1:04:18] shortly uh another three or four minutes
[1:04:21] I don't want to keep you long because of
[1:04:23] this potential storms and so forth here
[1:04:25] tonight but we can go to the next slide
[1:04:30] on questions and answers
[1:04:33] and um you know we're talking about
[1:04:35] condemnation we're talking about
[1:04:37] judgment uh you're not you as the Sons
[1:04:41] and Daughters of God attributes of God
[1:04:44] you do not go into judgment the bride
[1:04:48] will never be judged no sir she's in
[1:04:52] Christ if you're in Christ when Christ
[1:04:55] went to the Cross everything that needed
[1:04:58] to be judged was judged right there and
[1:05:01] then
[1:05:02] it was a finished that's why when Jesus
[1:05:06] finally completed
[1:05:08] he said it is finished
[1:05:10] what was finished the Judgment of his
[1:05:14] sons and daughters all those that that
[1:05:16] that that he redeemed all those whose
[1:05:19] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:05:21] Life
[1:05:22] those that that were predestinated to
[1:05:25] receive their the word of God for their
[1:05:27] day
[1:05:28] everything that you had need of God
[1:05:32] already provided it here we are two
[1:05:34] thousand years later because we are
[1:05:38] humans and we're living in this time
[1:05:41] dimension
[1:05:42] everything is relevant based on time to
[1:05:46] us
[1:05:47] because we're creatures of time
[1:05:49] you know let's face it right it takes so
[1:05:51] much time for me to walk from here to
[1:05:53] the back door
[1:05:55] we're in
[1:05:56] time and space and because of that
[1:06:00] everything is playing out
[1:06:04] but yet when you break out of this
[1:06:07] dimension
[1:06:09] and back into your
[1:06:11] rightful position as a son or daughter
[1:06:15] attribute of God there is no time or
[1:06:18] space
[1:06:19] it is a dimension of perfect
[1:06:24] of a perfect
[1:06:26] eternity that's why when you hear people
[1:06:28] they have you know they have near-death
[1:06:30] experiences their whole life flashes
[1:06:33] before their eyes and they can't explain
[1:06:34] how it is that that happened well it's
[1:06:37] simple they break out of this Dimension
[1:06:40] and and in that other dimension there is
[1:06:43] no time or space so you can look this
[1:06:45] way and you can look into the past you
[1:06:47] can look that way you can see the future
[1:06:48] that's why brother Branham as a prophet
[1:06:51] God gave him the ability by Vision to
[1:06:55] break into that other dimension so that
[1:06:58] he could see the future and see the past
[1:07:00] and that's why he could tell a person oh
[1:07:02] your name is Jack and two days ago you
[1:07:05] were at so and so and he told you this
[1:07:07] and he told you that and then he looks
[1:07:10] over here and you know the doctor said
[1:07:12] this but then he sees Jack walking
[1:07:14] perfectly whole over here
[1:07:16] and he says thus saith the Lord
[1:07:19] you'll not
[1:07:21] receive that doctor's report you'll be
[1:07:23] made whole if you'll just believe and he
[1:07:26] knows he's going to believe because God
[1:07:29] just spoke the revelation
[1:07:31] directly into his heart
[1:07:34] you see that's what God does your
[1:07:36] Awakening and your opening to the word
[1:07:38] of God and your ability to recognize the
[1:07:40] word was because God opened it to you
[1:07:44] he didn't say
[1:07:47] Josh I open your eyes he didn't have to
[1:07:49] say that
[1:07:51] all he had to do was preach a certain
[1:07:53] message and Josh at that moment
[1:07:56] something just clicked
[1:07:58] and he realized
[1:08:01] oh my God I'm a Son of God I'm an
[1:08:03] attribute of God I can see it as clear
[1:08:05] as a bell how come I don't even know how
[1:08:07] to explain it
[1:08:08] you don't try to explain a revelation
[1:08:12] a revelation is something that you
[1:08:13] cannot explain
[1:08:15] it's just revealed to you
[1:08:18] and when God reveals to you that you
[1:08:20] will not be judged that you've that
[1:08:23] everything that all your mistakes and
[1:08:25] all the things that that Satan tries to
[1:08:27] put you under condemnation for
[1:08:30] was already judged at Calvary
[1:08:33] and when Satan comes and says I'm going
[1:08:36] to put cancer on you that was already
[1:08:39] judged at Calvary
[1:08:42] how can he says buy his stripes we are
[1:08:47] healed how can we say we are healed
[1:08:51] because it was judged at Calvary
[1:08:55] it was the bleeding lamb everything was
[1:08:58] judged from before actually be from
[1:09:00] before the foundations of the world
[1:09:02] he knew exactly that we would come into
[1:09:05] this dimension
[1:09:07] we would have to face certain things
[1:09:10] certain circumstances situations that
[1:09:13] would bring us into you know into
[1:09:15] spiritual Amnesia into condemnation into
[1:09:18] all these things but
[1:09:20] there is now no condemnation to them
[1:09:24] that are in Christ remember we're in
[1:09:28] Christ the bride is in Christ the bride
[1:09:32] is is she's she's not only on that day
[1:09:36] she shall know that I am in the that I
[1:09:39] am in the father ye and me and I in you
[1:09:41] you will know that that you are actually
[1:09:43] in Christ and that he is in you and that
[1:09:46] he is actually displaying himself that's
[1:09:48] what the token the the token on display
[1:09:51] is Christ himself
[1:09:54] come down to manifest his word in our
[1:09:59] day in the season that we're living in
[1:10:02] to manifest it and display it before the
[1:10:04] people so that they can know that God is
[1:10:08] real in 2023 in July of 2023. Hallelujah
[1:10:15] come ahead brother Anthony
[1:10:17] next
[1:10:19] in the Rapture message he says and
[1:10:21] notice not only is the bride washed
[1:10:23] forgiven but she's Justified see did you
[1:10:28] ever try the word justify to see what it
[1:10:30] really means
[1:10:31] but the word Justified is though you
[1:10:35] never done it at all hallelujah praise
[1:10:39] God Amen
[1:10:41] you want to come to Christ I want you to
[1:10:44] know that God has made a way for you to
[1:10:46] come to Christ
[1:10:47] I want you to know that all you need to
[1:10:49] do is repent and be baptized in the name
[1:10:52] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[1:10:54] remission of your sins and God by the
[1:10:57] word of God is obligated to give you the
