[2:45] whole bunch of houses
[2:48] houses says and
[2:51] lands
[2:53] amen he said uh uh in this
[2:58] world and then he wants emphasiz it that
[3:01] they don't misunderstand him that he's
[3:02] talking about spiritual blessings he
[3:04] said in the present time and also in the
[3:10] world to come praise God so don't just
[3:13] talk about the little cab you going to
[3:15] have in glory land God has promised to
[3:17] bless his people right here right now
[3:20] and Solomon said what is the purpose of
[3:23] a man laboring he labors so that he can
[3:26] enjoy the fruits of his labor so he says
[3:29] go enjoy the fruits of your labor praise
[3:33] the Lord he said all that night you're
[3:35] going to leave it for the
[3:37] wicked it's up to you what you want to
[3:41] do but that's not the way to be you're

[3:51] you have to travel travel let the Lord
[3:54] have this way in your life praise the

[3:58] feeling bound up you know uh by the same
[4:03] message we claim to believe under
[4:05] legalism she so bound up that um to be
[4:10] richual almost ends up being like a
[4:11] curse no sir um you know that's not the
[4:15] way it is with God Amen he said I become
[4:18] po that you might
[4:20] become come on don't word like you're

[4:26] Rich he said I become poor not words I
[4:29] do without I without a whole my the
[4:32] foxes have way their head I didn't have
[4:34] none but I become for you might become
[4:38] rich is that right there's nothing wrong
[4:42] with being rich and you don't have to
[4:44] hide you don't have to just just you
[4:47] know you know it's God just walk with
[4:51] humility and allow the Lord to do his
[4:53] thing in your life amen he wants to show
[4:56] these Sinners that by evil and by
[4:58] wickedness by cunning their Mass well
[5:02] but he wants to show them that by wisdom
[5:07] Holiness serving him just like he did
[5:10] with Abraham I don't even know how I got
[5:12] on this but praise the Lord Abraham and
[5:17] and Isaac and all through the Bible and
[5:21] you have Breen telling you that no God
[5:24] is not interested in uh monetary Affairs
[5:28] and material things and and and stuff of
[5:31] that nature but they don't understand
[5:33] that every one of the prophets start
[5:36] for but look at the
[5:38] end look towards the end the Bible tells
[5:41] of job twice as much as he had before he
[5:45] didn't have anything God blessed him and
[5:47] then he took it away and then he gave
[5:49] him back so what do we care we in his
[5:52] hands just lay your life in his answer
[5:54] let him do whatever he wishes with you
[5:56] promotions promotions of the job R all
[6:00] those things he saids seek me first and
[6:03] I'm going to add all these things to you
[6:08] amen is this going to happen so so
[6:11] simply so easy you you're going to have
[6:15] help from Heaven Supernatural help will
[6:17] be on your side and and things are just
[6:20] going to be working out and you don't
[6:21] even know how it's working out but it's
[6:23] working out and that's how we are to
[6:26] live by faith amen knowing that it's not
[6:30] by our strength not by our wisdom though
[6:33] we will use it but he said this I give
[6:36] you the power to get well I give you the
[6:39] power you think you get it by yourself
[6:41] but I give you the power the wisdom you
[6:43] got I give you the forite the ideas I
[6:46] give you but you got to acknowledge Him
[6:50] First recognize he's the one that's
[6:53] doing it and God doesn't deny his
[6:55] children
[6:57] anything nothing he Grant you what the
[7:01] desires of your heart and if it doesn't
[7:04] line up with his word he'll stop you
[7:06] he'll block you or later on you have to
[7:08] slap you and let you back up a little
[7:10] bit or whatever but brother said I'd
[7:13] rather a man or a woman act on the word
[7:16] make mistakes repent and come back rise
[7:20] and try again says God doesn't like
[7:23] conservative don't want to make even a
[7:25] move wants to know everything is perfect
[7:28] and right before you make a move no act
[7:31] on the word when you act on the word and
[7:34] then God fulfills that word and he'll
[7:37] move in a mighty way praise the Lord so
[7:40] I'm glad to see every one of you here
[7:42] today you know I was in the mall and I
[7:44] was passing by and one of the men that
[7:46] was cleaning up and stuff like that and
[7:49] picking up uh garbage and stuff and
[7:52] putting it you know in the bags like you
[7:53] going to mall to see them doing that so
[7:55] I said hey how are you he says oh he
[7:58] says uh I I'm I'm I'm trying I said yeah
[8:01] I said but you should be happy your
[8:02] business is picking
[8:08] up
[8:12] laugh when I pass by again every may go
[8:17] back business is picking up even if it's
[8:21] garbage your business is picking up so
[8:25] have faith in
[8:27] God and he will bring it to pass amen
[8:31] I'm so happy that I can say I'm one of
[8:34] them praise the lord well let's read the
[8:38] scripture and let's talk amen good to
[8:41] see Alvin and am in the house of the
[8:44] Lord praise the Lord God richly bless
[8:47] them
[8:50] amen now um let's read out of Luke
[8:56] 24:49 I think it's one verse in
[9:18] praise the
[9:19] Lord okay let's read the verse before we
[9:22] read it Luke
[9:24] 24:49 um we're going to read that verse
[9:26] and then we'll just uh talk with one
[9:29] another here and see what the Lord has
[9:32] for us amen praise the Lord hallelujah
[9:36] you know some churches are built on
[9:38] healing Services that's the foundation
[9:42] you always have a healing service other
[9:44] ones are built on singing and and praise
[9:48] of
[9:49] War almost all the servic is f with
[9:51] singing and singing and singing and then
[9:53] they're really pushing in the Peace of
[9:55] the word uh towards the end all the ones
[9:58] are built on having always having shows
[10:01] or plays or this and that and you can
[10:04] use your mind what I'm trying to tell
[10:05] you uh churches are built on different
[10:08] different
[10:09] things when you come in here it would
[10:11] look simple and like there's hardly
[10:13] anything because we try to build it
[10:16] entirely on the word of God on the
[10:19] revelation of the word right not on
[10:22] flashes and shiny things or anything of
[10:24] that nature even though we can add that
[10:26] from time to time because you know after
[10:29] while even if you're cooking good food
[10:31] people get tired of the same uh you
[10:35] know you know what I'm saying praise the
[10:38] Lord hallelujah um so that's the point
[10:41] sometimes you you have to add a few
[10:43] things to it just to put some life there
[10:45] but other than that we have based this
[10:48] church and we try to base this church
[10:50] entirely on the revelation of the word
[10:53] so that when you come here you can be
[10:55] built up into a spiritual house for the
[10:58] glory of God
[10:59] amen so that's what this is about God
[11:02] hiding in Simplicity let us pray father
[11:06] we thank you for the word we thank you
[11:09] for the Bible we thank you for the
[11:11] prophet of God that came and gave us
[11:15] insights that we
[11:17] might understand what you're trying to
[11:20] tell us that you might build us up now
[11:23] with this verse before us we ask that
[11:26] you will expand open and magnify
[11:29] that we might have understanding and not
[11:32] only understanding but that it will move
[11:34] us into action we ask your blessing now
[11:38] in jesus' name as we read this together
[11:40] amen amen let us read and
[11:46] behold I send the promise of my father
[11:49] upon you but carry ye in the city of
[11:54] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[11:59] from God bless you please be
[12:03] seated as I was come along I pushed in
[12:06] the CD brother Grand was
[12:10] singing I find many people who don't
[12:15] understand why we are so happy and free
[12:20] we have crossed over Jordan
[12:23] toir land and that's what's the matter
[12:28] with me
[12:30] oh that's what's the matter with me
[12:34] praise God that's what's the matter with
[12:39] me i' crossed over Jordan
[12:43] to and that's what the matter with me
[12:48] amen praise God I've crossed over Jordan
[12:52] to came to Spirit land I crossed over
[12:55] from s into the holy spirit amen because
[12:59] Canan uh we use it sometime as a type of
[13:03] heaven but an naturual fact is the type
[13:07] of your receiving the Holy Ghost and
[13:09] still living on the earth and having to
[13:12] fight
[13:13] GS and deal with problems in your life
[13:17] while you're here and God promised that
[13:20] he would give you the
[13:21] victory is that right he promised us he
[13:24] would give us the victory he promised
[13:27] Joshua he would give him the victory
[13:29] he said but nevertheless I will give you
[13:32] the victory you'll overcome the entire
[13:35] uh land of Canaan God give you the
[13:37] victory you will overcome all your
[13:40] problems everything he says but I won't
[13:43] give you the victory in one year or two
[13:47] years or 10 but I will allow you to push
[13:51] your
[13:52] enemies out little by
[13:56] little so that you might know oh it's
[13:59] the Lord do it and not
[14:01] you because sometimes God gives you the
[14:04] victory too
[14:05] quickly and you believe that you got the
[14:08] victory by yourself that's right but he
[14:10] said no I won't give you the victory in
[14:14] few months or in a year but I allow you
[14:17] to push your enemy out that's right
[14:20] little by little amen little by little
[14:26] heing my way little by little my night
[14:30] turns today when I think of the Savior
[14:34] and what he has done little by little I
[14:38] am praising God's son amen little by
[14:41] little he's pushing out things out of
[14:43] your life you might not even recognize
[14:45] it but he's pushing things out of your
[14:47] life and you're changing by the grace of
[14:50] God hallelujah so I'm so glad about this
[14:53] now the background of this text of
[14:56] course is that uh uh first uh one uh
[15:00] they were all
[15:02] walking back to their home and you know
[15:05] the stranger appeared out of the bushes
[15:08] and began to talk to them just like the
[15:10] prayer of fire appeared out of the Bush
[15:12] and talk to Moses and so there it was
[15:16] that they got back the stranger what the
[15:19] stranger was saying was so uh it had a
[15:22] pull to it uh it pull them so they said
[15:25] listen you it's late in the evening you
[15:27] can't go on have to come in and stop
[15:30] with us is that right praise God I
[15:33] believe that's what God wants from all
[15:35] of us amen Lord come in and stay with me
[15:40] live in my heart live in my life I want
[15:44] you to live in my soul and be my house
[15:48] be your let me be your house let me be
[15:50] your habitation the place that you
[15:53] dwell and so he stopped in with them and
[15:57] the Bible tells us that uh they were
[15:59] going to eat and while they were about
[16:02] to eat Jesus broke the bread in a
[16:05] certain way and they recognize it I
[16:09] believe some of you recognize the way he
[16:11] breaks the bread even
[16:13] now amen you may not even recognize that
[16:17] you recognize how he broke that bread
[16:21] but just visited national Church wow and
[16:25] you will know the difference in how he
[16:27] broke the bread and how they breaking
[16:29] the bread is that right they can break
[16:32] the same
[16:33] bread but this is different when he
[16:36] breaks the
[16:38] bread praise God hallelujah amen so they
[16:43] recognize him in the opening of the
[16:45] word they recognize him the way that he
[16:49] was opening the word was not natural it
[16:52] was
[16:53] Supernatural it was God doing the
[16:56] opening of the word and then he came
[16:59] down later and he says to them but you
[17:02] are witnesses of these things and I will
[17:05] send the promise of the of my father
[17:08] upon you Hallelujah that's not the
[17:12] Father's Promise he's telling you
[17:15] telling them I'm going to send a promise
[17:17] of my father my father is the promise in
[17:20] other words the way the father dwell in
[17:22] me he's going to come and dwell in you
[17:25] and I'm sending to you the promise of
[17:28] the father who will dwell and live in
[17:32] you but wa in Jerusalem Hold Steady Hold
[17:37] Steady praise the Lord have a church
[17:40] home have a place where you re receiving
[17:42] the word and Hold Steady amen because
[17:45] every one of us is not going to receive
[17:48] this promise on the same
[17:50] day but we're going to receive it in
[17:54] God's
[17:55] time in the fullness of time God said
[17:58] for his son and God will send that
[18:01] promise upon you at the right time as
[18:05] I've always said no feel like some
[18:07] preachers will come visit this church
[18:09] another church another church they see
[18:10] one believer cardal somebody doing
[18:13] something else this one this one not
[18:15] dressed right that one and they say oh
[18:18] look at that preacher allowing this to
[18:20] happen in this church you don't
[18:22] understand you can't even go in a field
[18:24] out there and see all the fruits right
[18:26] rening on the same day
[18:30] it never happens and that's why we who
[18:33] are strong have to have compassion and
[18:36] humility for those that are
[18:38] weak because they they are where you
[18:42] were and they not coming along they may
[18:46] have they may just push their head out
[18:48] of the egg and they're covered with fil
[18:50] they're covered up with all kind of
[18:52] slime and everything else amen and it's
[18:55] going to look as oh that one is slimy or
[18:57] this one
[18:59] my God I'm seeing the same thing you
[19:01] were seeing but the fact is you got to
[19:03] understand people are at different
[19:04] levels of
[19:06] growth and they're coming out they're
[19:08] emerging by the grace of God
[19:12] hallelujah you know it's wonderful
[19:14] brother B was such a wise man think
[19:17] about it that he had the gift of being a
[19:19] prophet and he could see everything in
[19:22] our life but if he wanted to he could
[19:25] make every one of us run out of this
[19:27] church
[19:29] is that right what are you doing in here
[19:32] this that that that what what are you
[19:34] doing this that that what are you you
[19:37] know but no that's not the way it works
[19:41] when in the handling of these kinds of
[19:42] things God lets you know things but he
[19:46] lets you know for a purpose amen and
[19:48] then he has to reveal that proper
[19:50] purpose to you praise the Lord anyway
[19:53] here we find it brothers and sisters
[19:55] that he said we should wait on the
[19:57] promise of the father what I want to
[19:59] talk about today is uh backgrounding off
[20:02] of what was the Holy Ghost given for but
[20:05] I want to say the purpose of the Holy
[20:09] Ghost why you receive the Holy Ghost and
[20:14] why God gives us the Holy Ghost amen now
[20:18] we have a problem in the messes
[20:22] churches and the problem in the message
[20:25] churches and in every church but mainly
[20:27] in the M churches and what I want to uh
[20:30] uh speak about is that a lot of people
[20:34] are still so
[20:36] caral and they still don't have the Holy
[20:40] Ghost and the ones that don't have the
[20:43] Holy Ghost are usually the ones that
[20:44] have a always have a
[20:47] problem or making a
[20:50] problem creating
[20:52] problem because the eyes not open to
[20:55] fully
[20:57] see and when your eyes are open to see
[21:00] then you recognize where you're going
[21:02] and you stop bumping into
[21:05] things and so that carnality is in
[21:09] amongst the people because a lot of the
[21:11] preachers have convinced the people just
[21:13] by saying oh I believe the message that
[21:15] they're born again oh
[21:18] my uh brother says you are not even born
[21:21] again until you have received the Holy
[21:25] Ghost he say not
[21:28] converted until you receive the Holy
[21:32] Spirit matter of fact let me uh go right
[21:34] out of here unless it's thought that I'm
[21:37] making it up or something like that no
[21:40] he said it clearly in here that you're
[21:44] not even converted until you have the
[21:46] Holy Ghost amen praise God all right you
[21:50] are not converted page 15 until you have
[21:55] received the Holy Ghost amen before that
[21:59] you are believing unto you may have
[22:03] spoke the Holy Spirit might have spoken
[22:05] to you you may have publicly confessed
[22:08] him but the Devil Himself has gone that
[22:12] far and we even tell you I
[22:16] believe amen he will say I believe him
[22:20] to be the Son of God and so does the
[22:25] devil believe that see but when you're
[22:28] in that state you are only walking
[22:31] towards him see amen you must receive
[22:36] the Holy
[22:37] Ghost to be fully
[22:40] converted praise be to God and that's
[22:43] the problem a lot of people believe
[22:46] being around the message being in it
[22:49] long enough uh believing what the
[22:52] prophet said holl that that's uh that is
[22:58] what it is to be filled with the Holy
[23:00] Ghost sir but to be filled with the Holy
[23:04] Ghost is to receive the revealed word of
[23:08] God for your
[23:10] day and then he says to act upon
[23:14] Hallelujah in other words that word is
[23:17] going to bring an experience in your
[23:19] life you're not going to just go around
[23:22] and say I'm seeing the word I'm seeing
[23:24] the word that's good but you got to have
[23:26] an experience along with it
[23:29] and a lot of people are lacking that
[23:32] experience because the the devil has
[23:35] used a lot of ministers to put a
[23:38] scarecrow in the minds of the people to
[23:43] think that the Pentecostal experience
[23:46] something is wrong with
[23:48] it nothing is wrong with the Pentecostal
[23:52] experience all we have now is the word
[23:56] that should have been added
[23:58] toight amen praise God listen brother
[24:03] said if Lu was still around he would
[24:04] have received message and if Wesley was
[24:08] still he would receive the go message
[24:11] and if the real jary all time
[24:14] Pentecostal were still around they would
[24:16] receive this message praise God
[24:20] hallelujah they would receive it glory
[24:22] to God and now we want to throw out the
[24:26] baby with the back water
[24:28] amen because the prophet of God said is
[24:32] not the inial evidence of the Holy Ghost
[24:35] we TR out the entire Pentecostal
[24:37] experience we thr out the Pentecostal uh
[24:41] experience that is right there available
[24:44] for every one of us praise the Lord how
[24:48] you mean brother you mean to say God can
[24:52] make me speak with thongs yes just like
[24:54] he made the brother the other day speak
[24:57] with T amen oh but not all of us this is
[25:02] the difference not all of us were speak
[25:04] in Tong amen the Bible says to one he
[25:07] give a gift of healing to the next
[25:09] miracles to the next
[25:12] interpretation praise the Lord he
[25:14] interpretation what do you mean I'm
[25:16] going to know all these languages around
[25:18] the world and be able to interpret them
[25:19] maybe that could be one way of it amen
[25:23] but I know certainly uh uh being in a
[25:26] certain meeting and all of a sudden just
[25:29] the same way preaching like that and
[25:31] suddenly God fell on somebody and they
[25:33] spoke out in Tong and here's another
[25:35] person that don't know nothing and
[25:37] before you know it they start shaking
[25:38] they stand up and and they spoke out and
[25:41] it was interpretation of what the other
[25:43] person said see praise God God gives
[25:45] these gifts praise the Lord doesn't mean
[25:47] you're going to go around consciously
[25:49] going and interpreting Tong and
[25:51] languages but the holy spirit will come
[25:54] upon you and you will
[25:56] understand ref me back to the day of
[25:59] Pentecost so I can mention it to you how
[26:01] that when the the apostles were speaking
[26:03] in tongues you know they were speaking
[26:05] in them and yet these men were Hearing
[26:08] in their own language how hear
[26:11] we in our own
[26:14] language up here we know they're talking
[26:16] in some foreign
[26:18] language we know they're talking in a
[26:20] foreign town but but but uh we we
[26:24] understanding them this this is a
[26:26] miracle something is going on here how
[26:29] here we these men in our own language
[26:31] are not all these men
[26:34] Gans and first of all the Gans but
[26:37] they're speaking in foreign Tes amen and
[26:40] yet we are hearing them in our own
[26:43] language praise God hallelujah oh how
[26:47] blessed it is amen friends first of all
[26:50] I want you to know we should not be
[26:52] afraid of the Holy Ghost amen because a
[26:56] lot of people ask for the Hol Holy Ghost
[26:58] but if they're in a meeting like this
[27:00] and their Fe the Holy Spirit start to
[27:02] come on them amen they may feel the
[27:06] Boose BS they may feel their hair
[27:09] standing on them they may feel like
[27:11] getting up and jumping they may feel
[27:13] like doing something
[27:16] but we are not the religion of
[27:19] repression or depression or oppression
[27:22] amen whom the God sets you free the son
[27:25] of man set is free inde am amen we have
[27:29] to enter into the Glorious Liberty of
[27:31] the sons of God but sometimes we appear
[27:34] in church as if we more bound than
[27:36] anything else when you were out in the
[27:38] world there and the party start and the
[27:41] music start up you didn't sit down in
[27:43] your seat in a corner like a wall
[27:46] flower you were looking to be the first
[27:48] one out on the floor and then you're
[27:50] showing your shots you know I mean your
[27:53] foot slipping and sliding and you're
[27:55] showing your various shots like that
[27:57] praise the Lord but somehow when people
[28:01] come into church and they come in the
[28:03] house of God they start to feel like
[28:06] they're being B
[28:07] up amen they got lock job M they got
[28:13] ball and chain on their
[28:15] foot and they Shackled in their hands
[28:18] and they they can't even praise God to
[28:21] say
[28:22] hallelujah I mean the was let's praise
[28:25] the Lord that's go praise the Lord you
[28:28] mean you might as well be a
[28:31] robot you might as well be a robot
[28:34] because you're doing just like you told
[28:36] instead of it being genuine out your
[28:38] heart praise before you catch yourself
[28:40] Hallelujah before you can think amen
[28:43] that's right amen you are standing in
[28:46] the presence of the Living God and God
[28:48] is watching and waiting for your action
[28:51] for his reaction am praise the Lord and
[28:55] that's why we are in the house of the
[28:56] Lord here
[28:57] because we want to be open to the
[29:01] supernatural you want to be open to
[29:03] anything God will do in your life praise
[29:06] the Lord if God wants me to stand on my
[29:09] head I'll stand on my head it's like the
[29:12] man said if he tells me jump through
[29:13] that wall and jump through the wall it's
[29:16] his business to make a hole in the wall
[29:17] but I'm going to jump praise the Lord I
[29:21] believe our biggest obstacle is fear and
[29:25] prayer we fighting against still and we
[29:29] fighting against
[29:30] pride pride because we think more how we
[29:33] going to look instead of how we going to
[29:35] glorify God and give him the glory to
[29:38] his name and so we hold back and we save
[29:41] it up for another
[29:44] day amen God don't want you to save none
[29:47] of this manner up he wants you to eat it
[29:49] right now I use it for the glory for the
[29:52] glory of his name and so I believe there
[29:54] are obstacles in the message why people
[29:57] people are are afraid to praise God and
[30:00] and to act
[30:03] Pentecostal Hallelujah we not going back
[30:06] to Pentecost that is dead amen we not

[33:33] not your ancestor that you go and pray
[33:35] to no the Holy Ghost is not one of the
[33:38] Catholic saints up on the wall the Holy
[33:41] Ghost is
[33:42] God Amen the Bible said and he when he
[33:46] was on calary he
[33:49] saidon and he gave up the ghost amen it
[33:54] was God the father that was in him that
[33:57] he gave up so that the Holy Ghost can
[34:00] come back down on us am except the
[34:04] corner we fall in the ground it abides
[34:08] alone but if it goes into the ground it
[34:11] multiplies itself amen what was he
[34:14] talking about the breaking up of the
[34:16] pillar of fire to come into each
[34:18] believer's life amen each one a part of
[34:22] that Pillar of Fire and he symbolize it
[34:24] on the day Pentecost in the first church
[34:27] to show us that this is what's supposed
[34:29] to be with all of the other True
[34:32] Believers down Through the Ages he
[34:34] showed the literal purifier where you
[34:36] could see it back there but we may not
[34:39] literally see it here but you did that
[34:41] so you understand what's happening to
[34:43] you right so then later now the Holy
[34:46] Spirit comes to fill
[34:48] us and take over our lives and control
[34:52] us for his glory and praise on and until
[34:56] we get to that that place where we
[34:57] abandon ourselves and say Lord lead me
[35:00] and guide me for what where the sons of
[35:03] God are amen the sons of God they're led
[35:07] by the spirit of almighty
[35:09] God Amen so the Holy Ghost is God

[35:43] God living in his church moving through
[35:46] each ede working out his Divine will God
[35:51] himself dwelling in the church to
[35:54] continue his plans through the church
[35:57] that's what the purpose of the Holy
[35:59] Ghost is amen amen so God working in and
[36:04] through every one of us sends the Holy
[36:07] Ghost for that purpose that he might

[36:59] thing is um why don't you take the
[37:02] aspirin why don't you go to the doctor
[37:04] well we know they can do those things
[37:06] and we may even pray for them and still
[37:08] tell them to do that because even though

[37:13] them their faith is still on those
[37:16] things right so I may still tell them oh

[37:56] you starting to think it's you doing
[37:59] it and when you think like that you're
[38:01] going to always be embarrassed to pray
[38:03] for people because you going to thinking
[38:05] about if it don't happen is that right
[38:08] listen to the prophet he said God said
[38:11] it and I'm going to lay my hands on the
[38:13] sick and even if a thousand people fall
[38:16] on dead after finish praying I will
[38:18] still lay my hands on the sick am
[38:21] because he said they shall recover amen
[38:23] it's his business to know which ones he
[38:26] want to recover and the on he doesn't
[38:29] want to recover amen that is my business
[38:32] my business is the I come the amen and
