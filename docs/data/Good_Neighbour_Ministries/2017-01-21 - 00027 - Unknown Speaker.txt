TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I was about to answer him when I was about to answer him both of us were struck when we heard like a stick tap tap tap and for some reason we stopped talking when we look it was his grandfather and the grandfather was trying to come up the stairs and uh I'm speaking P he said me Mayar you in other words I heard what you were saying right he says God been a dark I said listen that's your grandfather I'm not answering the question God just answering question to your grandfather see God can use even a sa let me go to the bible let you think I'm making this up you remember jedro was what was a vagan priest a magician the man was a pagan but he was Moses's father-in-law and he was a pagan priest when he came to Moses and said Moses man you're turning out yourself and you you're a servant of God why don't you ask your God to take some of your spirit and put it look at the wisdom that man had put it on S the other men or some other men so that they can assist you with the work you suppose Moses stood with his rod and said how dare you speak to me don't you know I'm the prophet of the hour don't you know that I all the staff that I raised over the rent seed how dare you you know but that's the point you see if you're a true child of God with that Spirit of humility on you you are listening all the time yeah you're listening even if you hear a child speak you're listening you're listening I mean listening not in the sense that you because we got your ears listening but your spirit is tuned to God so you're picking up things around you without having to think about it I'm tell you brothers and sisters it sounds simple but listen for the voice of God in this coming year and allow God to speak to you and use anybody to speak to you because his voice can come from anywhere praise the Lord hallelujah God can use of course we want God's voice to come from inside of a pillar of fire then we going to believe now I know God spoke to me because when I prayed I saw a fire and I of the fire came a voice that's when you're going to believe or we want the voice of God come with an angel appears and then we're going to believe amen that's what we think H and we want it in that kind of a way but in 2 Kings 319 9 to4 you don't have to find it you remember Elijah and when Elijah was in the cave and in the great wind fast and but it says the voice of God was not in it and then you have had the Thunder and the lightning and everything in it but then there came a still Small Voice and sometimes God likes to speak to us in a still Small Voice and some people don't want to get still because that voice can be very Bome can trouble your conscience you shouldn't have done that you know you was wrong when you spoke like that maybe the person doesn't know but just what was coming up to you wasn't right person doesn't know anything and you bothered because the holy spirit is grunting you now you're a child you're a son a real Son of God and so you need to deal with it but we need to listen for the voice of the holy spirit in this coming year because I believe God is going to lead us guide us and direct us we're going to move into a another realm uh where he's moving in a wonderful way for me I'm asking God for a personal Revival I'm asking for my strength to be renewed I'm asking for a personal Pentecost amen I'm asking for a fresh anointing I'm asking for the Holy Spirit to come down upon me and use me for his glory and for his honor and one thing I want to say uh as I I move from that into uh what I want to talk talk about here uh by wishing you a happy new year is that now you're going to enter into this New Year remember what Isaiah is said here God is telling Israel with all the things that happened to them all the attacks they got from their enemies Everything That Came Upon them he says remember not the former things neither consider the things of all behold I will do new thing now it shall spring forth you shall know it I will even make a way to Wilderness and rivers in the desert listen to Brother Brad I can remember laying here on a hospital bed the doctors gave me 3 minutes to live my heart beat 17 times to the minute I met God since then I haven't been the same something happened to me no one can tell me any different Billy gram died I met God something coming to me oh God and I've never been the same since

and I met God hallelujah men and women when you meet God you are change yes sir tonight we may make New Year's vows and then go back tomorrow morning and break them yeah we may go back next day or

of it you can have a tank full of gas it could be the highest octain gas it could be the most Revelation but unless you get that spark hits that gas that gas only has the potential of power the potential of power is in it but it takes the fire of God to release it am oh send the fire send the fire send the fire amen I need a personal Pentecost in my life and if you feel the same say Lord

come out of that am amen you are become a reflector of Christ amen praise the Lord there's a huge difference from a believer that don't have no prayer life don't spend time with God don't read that Bible enough or even they read the Bible they read they just read it cursory like you're reading a regular book if they pray they pray with no real depth of feeling or any emotion just to be able to say s my prayers this morning like a child saying their prayer before they go to man they're not going to God with real sincerity and earnestness and dig down deep within their soul and and really talk to God when you start to approach God like that with tears with with with your heart with your soul amen he says only when you pour out your soul then I'm going to meet you amen and you're going to Spring forth like the mo day glory to God hallelujah God is looking for a people that want the die to themselves to become alive in Him Praise the Lord oh praise God listen the prophet is going to

I'm going to this church I'm a Christian I'm a Believer that's okay you can be living an absolutely clean and moral life and the prophet said you still could be a miserable wrch right is that right praise the name of the Lord hallelujah not he said I was not running around I was not drinking I wasn't gambling I wasn't smoking amen but yet I was nothing but a miserable W you see but when death came into that hospital room 20 years ago I knew that even though amen he was a good man and everything else in religious there was yet something lacking in my life there I not God for real for from

leadings of the Holy Spirit the the creation of God the power of the Holy Spirit working through his life that's the experiences and now he's asking God to give the people in Grand tacle oh God give us experiences hallelujah praise the Lord you know one time uh what was it he said to the Lord um he prayed a prayer one time and he said oh Lord if you could only do this for me it will strengthen my fi I forgot what what it was but he said oh what oh yeah he was laying on his bed like that and then he's talking to the Lord oh God if you could just let me uh look past the curtain of time it was so strength with my Fai well wasn't his faith strong enough wasn't he getting all kinds of Miracles and everything else but he's striving to go higher higher deeper in God be more of a Christian be more committed be more consecrated because the the present age is now this year and if you don't watch it you you you you get fired up and before you know it the devil slowly start to pour water on your Christianity upon your experience and then you start to lose the reality of and then the next thing you know you start doubting if God is really real in your life in your hold in your walk in your talk my God think about it brothers and sisters that's what the devil does but God want you to keep the fire in the water want to keepe real GL to God we're going into a new year and we're going to be trusting God and believing God in every possible way amen give us experiences Lord give us also of thy goodness and mercy oh praise God if anybody needs Mercy is me amen praise God myself and two

recognize who I am and brought me out by the grace of God oh God also forgive us of all of our sins amen don't you want to ask God to forgive all your sins from this last year Hallelujah that would be enough to condemn me or condemn you but thank God he's a god rich in Mercy Hallelujah think about it amen oh God let us live through this coming year oh Lord God I pray again father to us to live with an experience yeah that we have met you and our lives have been changed amen he knows the age we are living in because the body has built up from the foundation of the foot right up to the the age of the lips into the age of the eyes of the Seer the prophet and then it's gone now into the Mind age it's an information age in the natural world and the same happen in the message where people are packing up themselves how much more than message this one more than the other one everything else like that in the competition for knowing the message and quoting the Bible and quoting the word and everything else like that but he is saying look that's good you know all that stuff but you got to have experiences with that Hallelujah you got to make something that become real to you to make that word live hallelujah hallelujah that word has got to live again amen you got to be able to live before God and watch this w c life amen praise God forever oh God I ask you to let us live through this coming year with an experience that we have met you and Lord forgive us of our shortcomings place within us your Holy Ghost to lead us and guide us how many watch the Holy Ghost I'm not telling you a about the Holy Ghost but we get one in one baptism one in feeling but many baptisms the way you get baptized with the Holy Ghost along the way many many times you in the service you feel an anointing that you got a baptism you you're praying in your prayer class something sweep over you you got another baptism but you were filled and sealed with him what amen but but the baptism baptis all means you go in and you come out because after you get that anointing your PR you leave to go to work after it seems to leave you is that right it's not gone from you but it seems to leave you praise the Lord so we need a constant a constant living in the presence of the King on that's why if you want to keep it and restore it even while you're working while you're playing while you while you're doing anything Paul said you keep singing and speaking to yourself in songs singing songs and singing songs with your heart and quing scriptures amen with in your mind you don't have to do it to make yourself sound suers but on the inside of you your living in the presence of the king let the world say what they want they're standing on the promise of his word for this house Amen Let the doubs run out and say all kinds of stuff and criticize the prophet the message your pastor I don't mean me the pastors following the message and everything else but brother sister we are going to hold the God's unchanging hand amen because the pastor didn't give me give me baptism the pastor didn't give me re the pastor did not give me the Holy Ghost the pastor did not open my eyes he who holds the that's

me anywhere I give myself to you in service let that we have prayers here tonight amen anywhere you want Lord just speak and I will go also Lord I ask your blessing upon my church amen that is what I ask here tonight as we face this new and coming year I ask God's blessing upon my church here not only upon the church but listen he said Lord I ask your blessing upon the ministry with me in this church I ask the same thing here tonight in the name of Jesus Christ upon all of you Brothers amen all you sisters every one of you that are taking a position and doing something in the kingdom of God I call down the blessing of God upon you that God will do something in your life for his glory and for his honor amen yes sir oh God give us a great year he said I say God give us a great year in 2017 Hallelujah give us your etur grace to serve you now and forever in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise prise God hallelujah as we face this New Year let us as I have read Darkness and Light we see David speaking here saying trust in the Lord put your confidence in him Isaiah said Gross darkness is coming upon the people but for the church rise Shine for the glory of your life is come Hallelujah is that right yeah the world is being covered with Darkness out there you can see it everywhere for then it's getting darker but for us it's getting brighter because Jesus is coming closer the Revelation is coming clearer and the path of the Jud of a righteous man is as a shining light that grows brighter and brighter until he steps into the perfect thing the Revelation gets clearer and clearer until you step into the perfect day so we face this year just like we do all other years we face it with regrets for the mistakes in the past how many regret their mistakes and let you repent publicly Now by just raising your hands you repented publicly you're not confessing to me but you confess to God I regret the mistakes of my past that we have made but we must expect that because it goes along like that pro and con humans living with the law of averages that we live by while we are here in this life in other words you're not going to be perfect you're not going to always strike it right every time like that but thank God we have a mediator who sets at the right hand of God when we are willing to admit our mistakes that we done wrong that's when he forgives us is that right amen praise the Lord he is full of grace and mercy to forgive us for all those mistakes praise the Lord brothers and sisters we got to First repent of our mistakes and when we do that that's when God forgets it you know that Hallelujah remember what God says that he'll take your sins and throw them in the sea of forgetfulness and I will so he remembered as long as you haven't repented of it as long as you haven't let the thing go as long as you hav't overcome it he remembers it when he remembers it you going to pay for it but when you repent of it he said okay I remember it no more you know somebody says oh I did that it was so long ago in the past yeah it's in the past it's in the past but you got to repent of it sincerely and when you do that not only do you let it go sometimes you can't let it go but when you repent of it he remembers it no more and he lets it Go and set you free completely for his glory and for his honor praise the Lord may the Lord bless these few words to your hearts tonight with all the sincerity in my heart that brought here to you that that's the way to have a Happy New Year to enter it not with with a lame lukewarm Spirit but to enter it with confidence with joy with expectation and believing God to have a wonderful positive experience in this new coming year let's change the order of the service while the musicians come the brothers take their place for the Lord's supper we're going to have a simple Lord supper amen praise the Lord make sure you have some c music when I'm ready to be able to use that background to sing
