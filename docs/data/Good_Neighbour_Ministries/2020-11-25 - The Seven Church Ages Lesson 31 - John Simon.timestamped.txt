[0:00] [Music]
[0:14] praise the lord friends
[0:16] i'm happy to be here once again with you
[0:20] to rejoice and praise and
[0:23] magnify the great and
[0:26] wonderful name of our lord jesus christ
[0:31] god bless you i'm speaking today
[0:36] on smyrna the second church
[0:40] age part one last week we had the
[0:44] introduction
[0:45] now we are on part one
[0:49] of the second church age
[0:52] called smyrna let us read our scripture
[0:57] and then we shall proceed
[1:00] with our study
[1:03] revelation chapter 2
[1:07] verse 8 and
[1:10] unto the angel of the church in
[1:13] smyrna right
[1:17] these things which see it the first and
[1:20] the last
[1:22] which was dead and
[1:26] is alive god bless the wonderful and
[1:29] marvelous name
[1:31] of our lord jesus christ
[1:34] now as i've said we are speaking on the
[1:38] second
[1:38] church age part one called smyrna
[1:43] now smyrna a city that was
[1:47] north of ephesus at the mouth
[1:51] of the gulf of smyrna
[1:55] it had a very fine harbor
[1:58] uh and a beautiful commercial center
[2:03] that was renowned throughout the world
[2:06] for its exports
[2:09] it was also a very distinguished city
[2:13] distinguished for its schools
[2:17] of rhetoric philosophy
[2:21] medicine sciences
[2:25] and fine architecture
[2:28] was seen everywhere
[2:32] now many jews lived in this city
[2:36] called smyrna and
[2:39] they were bitterly i say
[2:42] bitterly opposed to christianity
[2:46] at that time and there were even more
[2:50] bitter and uh against
[2:53] christianity even more than the romans
[2:57] that was there at that particular day
[3:02] in fact polycarp
[3:05] was martyred by the jews
[3:08] and the hatred for christianity was so
[3:12] horrible that
[3:15] they broke their sabbath day rules
[3:20] they desecrated their own sabbath
[3:24] to go out further than a mile
[3:29] to collect firewood enough wood
[3:32] to be able to create a bonfire
[3:37] a pillar of a funeral pyre
[3:41] so that they may be able to
[3:45] destroy burn burn up
[3:48] polycarp
[3:52] now the word smyrna in itself
[3:56] means bitter
[3:59] and that is derived from the word
[4:02] myrrh as you know the kings brought
[4:06] him jesus gold frankincense
[4:10] and myrrh mar
[4:13] was used for the embalming of the dead
[4:17] so back then when the kings the three
[4:21] kings
[4:22] brought gifts from afar they brought
[4:25] appropriate gifts
[4:27] because each gift had a prophetic
[4:31] insight in it right and so
[4:34] murr in particular was speaking of his
[4:38] death that was to come so
[4:42] we find here mar speaks
[4:46] of death and the dead
[4:51] now there's a twofold meeting here
[4:55] that was speaking the name of the city
[4:58] the name
[4:59] of it was pointing to the fact that it
[5:02] was a
[5:03] an age upcoming an age
[5:06] that was filled with the bitterness
[5:10] of spiritual death
[5:13] now with the the two vines
[5:17] good and evil are now we're now at work
[5:22] within the branches the framework
[5:26] of the church of the living god
[5:29] and here were these two vines
[5:33] the false and the true
[5:37] and were drifting further apart
[5:40] with greater and greater bitterness
[5:45] that was being openly manifested
[5:49] they were openly manifesting it towards
[5:52] the true vine by this false vine
[5:57] but death was not the only seed
[6:00] of the false vine but
[6:04] even in the true vine the true church
[6:08] there was a creeping paralysis
[6:12] and impotence
[6:15] and this a lot of this was because of
[6:18] the inheritance
[6:22] atmosphere and conditions
[6:25] that ensued within
[6:28] the church of god a wave
[6:32] of what was in ephesus
[6:35] or in the ephesian church age i just
[6:39] washed right over into
[6:43] the smurnian church age
[6:48] now we know that no true believer
[6:52] is stronger and healthier
[6:57] and alive
[7:00] than in their knowledge of
[7:03] and their participation and
[7:07] of and in their
[7:10] obedience to the revealed word of god
[7:14] that they receive within their lives
[7:19] and there are multitudes of examples of
[7:21] those in the old testament
[7:23] and israel itself we know would be one
[7:27] of them
[7:28] now here we are smyrna
[7:32] organization began to rear its head
[7:36] it began to grow
[7:39] and confirming and
[7:42] augmenting the death
[7:45] of the membership holy ghost
[7:49] leadership by the holy ghost was
[7:52] overthrown for the leadership
[7:57] of man the word of god
[8:02] that was rich in the church from the
[8:05] ministries of paul
[8:07] and irene yes was now my
[8:10] friend uh re being replaced by
[8:14] creeds dogmas
[8:18] and various teachings of man
[8:21] along with man-made rituals
[8:26] that were never ordained of god
[8:29] in any way shape or form
[8:34] now just as israel
[8:37] great nation under the anointing
[8:40] under the glow of the pillar of fire
[8:45] began to lose her place her position and
[8:49] her power
[8:51] by her own illegal and unlawful
[8:56] alliances joining herself in other words
[9:00] to nations that were ungodly
[9:03] leaving the word for the the dominating
[9:07] nations
[9:08] of that time and entered into alliances
[9:13] with them and finally they formed
[9:17] all manner of fellowships all manner
[9:21] of unions with them
[9:24] and finally the day came when
[9:28] those nations or worldliness
[9:31] or baptism took took them over
[9:34] and they were captured all believers
[9:38] we must be careful that we are not
[9:40] captured
[9:41] by the world that we are not seduced and
[9:45] charmed by the wisdom of man but that we
[9:48] are
[9:48] led by the holy spirit the true and
[9:51] living god
[9:53] oh praise his wonderful name
[9:57] now when israel left the land
[10:00] or was taken from the land because we
[10:04] know
[10:05] that that is satan's strategy
[10:08] that is satan's plan the first thing he
[10:12] does
[10:13] to weaken a son a daughter
[10:16] a servant of the living god at church
[10:20] of the living god is first of all to
[10:23] shift them out of their
[10:26] land to shift you or i
[10:29] or any uh church off
[10:33] of the word foundation
[10:36] off of the revelation the opening
[10:39] of the word and shift you off
[10:43] into something that that is dead
[10:46] that is contrary to the word of god
[10:50] and so israel was made
[10:53] captive and brought into the land
[10:57] of babylon now when they
[11:01] got into babylon and went into captivity
[11:07] israel went into captivity
[11:11] having a an ironic
[11:14] priesthood the priesthood that god
[11:17] started
[11:18] when aaron was placed there and then his
[11:20] sons and son sons
[11:22] right through the levite and it came
[11:24] true
[11:25] that god had set up and allowed a
[11:28] priesthood
[11:29] aaronic priesthood back then which was
[11:32] nothing but a type
[11:34] priesthoods are not something that were
[11:38] to be continued down through the ages
[11:41] now here we find they came
[11:44] into captivity having a priesthood
[11:48] having a temple lord of god
[11:51] and having the fullness of the word of
[11:54] the lord
[11:55] but you see the time when this
[11:58] that they spent in babylon their
[12:01] faith became mixed as paul would say
[12:05] their fate was corrupted it was
[12:08] of added things or added things were
[12:12] taken away
[12:13] and so the face of the people of israel
[12:16] were was actually corrupted
[12:21] and we know this to be the truth for
[12:24] when
[12:25] they came out of captivity
[12:28] they did not come out having so much
[12:31] worrying about priests they had
[12:35] rabbis they had
[12:39] my brains theological orders
[12:43] or fraternities of pharisees and
[12:46] sadducees epicureans and stoics and
[12:49] and libertines and so on they had
[12:52] various fraternities various
[12:56] theological orders of that
[12:59] day and there they were
[13:02] instead of the temple they now had
[13:06] multitudes of synagogues
[13:09] and my friends here now
[13:13] instead of the torah they came out with
[13:17] the
[13:17] torah plus writings
[13:20] of the rabbis called the talmud
[13:25] which is not the word of god
[13:28] but it's the words wise words
[13:32] but words of the rabbis
[13:35] added to the torah which was
[13:40] god's word and we see that today
[13:43] everywhere we have the word of god
[13:45] then we have wonderful wise words of
[13:48] geological men trained men knowledgeable
[13:52] man
[13:53] educated intelligent smart man
[13:56] and good as it may be and sound it
[13:59] is not the word of god the word of god
[14:03] was revealed
[14:04] and made known to us by his marvelous
[14:07] grace hallelujah now at the height
[14:11] of this corruption then jesus came
[14:16] and when jesus came
[14:20] he called them of their
[14:23] father the devil he
[14:26] pointed out the evil
[14:29] that he could discern in them
[14:32] and in their midst
[14:36] and sparked in spite of the fact that
[14:39] they were
[14:40] of abraham's children by flesh
[14:45] they were not his children of faith
[14:50] now there we see it friends
[14:53] we see the same thing happening
[14:57] in this in this age of smyrna
[15:01] where there are those who call
[15:04] themselves
[15:05] jews and they are not
[15:08] and we see that happening in our day and
[15:11] in our age
[15:13] way down the centuries from smyrna to
[15:16] now
[15:17] and there are millions around the world
[15:21] that say we are christian we are born
[15:24] again
[15:24] and they are not
[15:27] all friends look at the word of god
[15:31] look in the mirror of god's word let us
[15:35] search our hearts search ourselves
[15:38] and see if we are who god says
[15:42] that we are but thank god
[15:46] out of this mess this morass
[15:50] this bog of evil filthy f
[15:55] and feuded sin out of it my friend
[15:58] always comes a little flock a little
[16:02] group
[16:03] and there was a little group of jews
[16:06] that stood faithful and true to the
[16:10] ordained anointed word of god for the
[16:13] hour
[16:14] there's always also even to this day
[16:18] satan with all of his washing of dirty
[16:21] baggage dirty clothes his rumors his
[16:24] lies
[16:25] and everything else his assassinations
[16:27] of character
[16:29] all his works that he tried to unleash
[16:32] against the
[16:33] church of the living god but still there
[16:37] remains
[16:38] a little flock ordained by the word of
[16:42] god
[16:42] to be here in this day in time
[16:46] thank god he watches over his own
[16:51] and if you are one of his own he is
[16:53] watching over you
[16:54] right now with all the attacks upon your
[16:58] face all the tests upon your foundations
[17:02] upon the teaching that you have received
[17:05] and and
[17:06] base yourself on they're going to be
[17:09] shaken
[17:10] satan will shake you shake your
[17:13] foundations
[17:14] but all praise god i know according to
[17:18] the
[17:18] book of the book of psalms the
[17:21] foundations of god
[17:22] stand it sure and god anoint
[17:25] them that are his thanks be to god
[17:28] stand for him and he'll stand for you
[17:32] o all to god's unchanging hand
[17:35] hold to god's unchanging hand especially
[17:39] when we see
[17:40] the end of all things are come
[17:43] and the coming of our lord for his bride
[17:46] is at hand glory his name
[17:50] now in this city there were two
[17:53] famous temples one to uh
[17:57] civil or celebi
[18:00] see billy see or we may say
[18:04] cebu no and
[18:07] there was another one that was
[18:11] of the worship of zeus
[18:15] now between those these two
[18:18] temples ran a beautiful street
[18:21] which was called the golden street
[18:26] now joining up these two temples
[18:30] joining the godzillas and the goddess
[18:34] symbiote they're my friends
[18:38] it started paganism introducing itself
[18:44] into christianity and starting
[18:47] in the first age and was known
[18:50] to exist only in rome
[18:54] but now it is found in smyrna
[18:57] in other words that spirit that
[19:00] devilish demonic teaching and anointing
[19:04] began to disperse its influence
[19:08] throughout the roman empire
[19:13] and he used the very same things god
[19:17] used
[19:18] god used the greeks the language
[19:21] was spread everywhere the laws teaching
[19:24] were spread everywhere
[19:26] so god used that to let the word flow
[19:28] out
[19:29] the romans had the robes for
[19:31] transportation and communication
[19:34] and he used that for the spread of the
[19:37] gospel everywhere
[19:38] satan did the very same thing and from
[19:42] rome this this teaching these beliefs in
[19:46] these
[19:47] false gods of rome
[19:50] began to uh uh spread out
[19:54] throughout the roman empire
[19:58] i am now speaking about smyrna
[20:02] and here we find a temple to zeus and
[20:04] sybil
[20:07] and friends this my friends is where
[20:11] we find the very seeds the seed
[20:15] of mary all the tree or the belief
[20:19] in mary whom
[20:22] is called the mother of god
[20:26] and receive all manner of honors and
[20:28] worship and
[20:29] titles and powers given to her
[20:33] even it's been said that she has
[20:36] co-equal
[20:38] with jesus christ
[20:42] and now i would speak on that
[20:46] but also
[20:49] the golden streak comes into this
[20:51] picture
[20:53] it was a hint from satan
[20:57] to the people that whoever joins
[21:00] his church his temple of zias or sibil
[21:04] like today you join certain major
[21:07] churches
[21:08] and immediately you can be if you're
[21:12] smart and wise
[21:13] you are on golden street because you
[21:17] will be introduced
[21:18] to certain people of high positions
[21:21] high powers people that can give you
[21:24] connections
[21:25] guide you mentor you lead you and
[21:28] instead of searching for the word of god
[21:32] instead of searching for the power the
[21:35] preeminence and the leadership of the
[21:37] holy spirit
[21:38] the people are going for human might and
[21:41] human power
[21:43] this this church this pagan
[21:47] uh church that teaches mary
[21:50] and place her in this exalted position
[21:54] contrary to the word of god
[21:57] and it's greed that causes these people
[22:00] to join themselves to what is
[22:04] nicolettianism an ungodly priesthood
[22:08] that dominates over the people
[22:12] and helps to join state
[22:15] and the church together
[22:19] and enjoying that that group
[22:22] that join those temples they
[22:25] joined those chur that church
[22:29] because they know that that
[22:32] is their golden street to wealth
[22:36] power and influence
[22:39] they knew it because that's what the
[22:41] church could offer them that's what they
[22:44] this could offer them that's what
[22:48] seville can offer them and so in droves
[22:52] they join themselves to that particular
[22:56] church not just for the religiosity
[23:00] but for the actual a practicality
[23:04] in human life that will lead them and
[23:08] take them on a street paved with gold
[23:11] down here but friends thanks be to god
[23:15] we are not just looking for our streets
[23:18] to be our
[23:19] uh to walk on streets of gold down here
[23:22] we'll walk on the streets of gold in the
[23:24] presence
[23:24] of the living god
[23:28] now the ephesian
[23:31] church age
[23:34] was the tragic
[23:38] tragic
[23:41] uh influence that would bring forth
[23:46] the church age of pertinence
[23:51] and yet we find in this
[23:54] church age of smyrna
[23:58] was the rain and the sun
[24:02] and the nourishment that
[24:05] ensured vileness
[24:09] corruption that would conform the church
[24:14] in its idolatry that they were already
[24:17] practicing at that time but it was
[24:20] openly
[24:22] in the name of zias and sibil but they
[24:25] were practicing
[24:26] idolatry at the particular time
[24:30] which is nothing but spiritual
[24:32] fornication
[24:33] against god and my friends to this day
[24:39] the church has not recovered
[24:42] from that idolatry that was now
[24:46] preparing itself to be introduced into
[24:49] christianity
[24:51] paganism masking itself
[24:56] on in the guise of christianity
[25:00] these are wolves trying to
[25:03] wear sheep clothing but with
[25:06] sharp teeth bloody
[25:10] terrible horrible their house
[25:14] their tackles the evil that indwells
[25:18] moves through them oh friends
[25:21] death was now entering in the church
[25:26] to permeate both root and branch
[25:30] and they that part took up that
[25:33] or became a part of that took part
[25:37] in her bitterness
[25:40] that would lead them to spiritual death
[25:45] now we know that this age of smyrna
[25:49] lasted from 170
[25:52] a.d to 308
[25:57] a.d revelation
[26:01] to eight these things said he
[26:06] the first and the last which
[26:10] was dead but is alive
[26:14] the first and the last which was dead
[26:18] and is alive think of it this speaks of
[26:21] life coming out of death not
[26:25] alive and was dead
[26:29] but is dead and
[26:32] is alive of
[26:36] all men we read in their genealogy
[26:41] and adam lived for so many years and he
[26:44] died
[26:46] and methuselah lived for so many years
[26:49] and he died all the various genealogies
[26:54] mentions they lived and they died
[26:58] but of this one we are reading he said
[27:02] i am the first and the last
[27:06] i was dead
[27:12] and i am i am now alive forevermore
[27:16] praise god in other words he lifted the
[27:19] curse
[27:20] he turned around spiritual death and
[27:23] caused us to enter into spiritual life
[27:26] praise be to god bless his name forever
[27:29] and ever
[27:31] now we know that a natural man
[27:34] a mere human could not speak
[27:37] really be alive like that from the grave
[27:43] he if it was just a natural man he would
[27:46] say
[27:46] i was alive and now i am dead
[27:51] but not this one i was
[27:54] dead and now i am alive
[27:58] i am the first and the last hallelujah
[28:01] the first thing that happens to a man is
[28:03] that he is born
[28:05] and the last thing that happens to him
[28:08] is that he
[28:09] is he dies or he is dead
[28:12] but this is not man speaking
[28:15] this deity speaking this is god speaking
[28:18] this is the almighty speaking true
[28:21] to us to recognize who he is
[28:25] by the grace of god hallelujah now we
[28:28] know
[28:29] that the man adam took life and
[28:32] turned it into death
[28:37] adam my friends
[28:40] did that but jesus christ came along
[28:44] and took death and turned it into life
[28:49] adam took our innocence
[28:52] and turned it into guilt
[28:56] and condemnation inferiority complexes
[29:01] and so on but he
[29:05] took our guilt and
[29:08] turned it into righteousness where we
[29:11] are have become
[29:13] the righteousness of god in christ
[29:16] hallelujah
[29:17] oh praise god forevermore we are the
[29:20] righteousness of god
[29:22] in him adam took paradise
[29:27] and turned it into a waste howling
[29:31] wilderness but this
[29:34] mighty christ this mighty one
[29:38] who said i am the first i am the last
[29:41] i was dead but i'm alive forevermore
[29:45] he has taken to a world rocking and
[29:49] reeling with all mirror
[29:52] of corruption and destruction pollution
[29:57] oh praise god hallelujah
[30:00] and he is turning it back into an eden
[30:03] again
[30:04] in the millennium period uh which is to
[30:07] come
[30:08] glory to god hallelujah amen
[30:11] we're going to another millennium
[30:14] one thousand year reign
[30:18] when he will cleanse the earth by the
