[0:00] we communicate because part of this walk
[0:05] with God you know God is giving you more
[0:08] responsibility as you draw closer to
[0:10] them as you become freer because you're
[0:14] actually becoming free we please people
[0:24] on earth because we are we are being set
[0:30] free by the things that we speak we are
[0:33] being released from this world that's
[0:35] what we did this straight into
[0:37] tribulation we cannot change what is
[0:40] going to come to pass in this world it's
[0:43] not going to get better it's gonna get
[0:51] better because we are the church that
[0:54] leaves before this Great Tribulation
[0:57] strikes the earth and so with that
[1:00] character that God is giving us to walk
[1:03] with Him as we get closer and closer to
[1:07] that time and to that season he is
[1:09] putting more and work from our character
[1:13] and how ability to to submit ourselves
[1:17] to the Word of God and took and to be
[1:19] and we get to be free and to have the
[1:24] ability to receive is his spirit and his
[1:27] anointing in a simple way
[1:42] of this ministry of the third poll and
[1:44] what it actually is producing what it's
[1:47] actually supernaturally doing and
[1:50] placing coloring positioning the sons
[1:53] and daughters of God if you become
[1:55] responsible this is more you know the
[1:59] responsible and you get promoted to a
[2:07] certain position they're being given
[2:09] more responsibility and you've got a lot
[2:13] more conscious your authority and so God
[2:20] is but sure of the bride into the third
[2:24] pole get nervous this supernatural
[2:27] inspiration that UBC's she listen you
[2:31] can't work you are given the ability to
[2:37] receive it and then they're given the
[2:39] ability to seat to the seat being
[2:43] fulfilled you're given prophetic ability
[2:46] and vision to see the word being
[2:49] fulfilled around and you will see
[2:52] witness certain events and they'll be
[2:55] able to place to place
[2:58] in the situation you'll see what this
[3:00] happened so that this could come to pass
[3:03] Mimi you see it's all God working of
[3:06] this planet bringing the sons and
[3:09] daughters of God together in their
[3:16] position their portion of the word he
[3:37] does anything for you the world you want
[3:41] to hide the core department you wanna
[3:44] you want to submit the live for him
[3:47] that's how he does it and he does and he
[3:56] says greater is He that is in you it's
[4:00] me that's in you if I can think I got so
[4:03] many faults here we brother branham you
[4:07] know the brother brother was was out
[4:09] there hunting and the Holy Spirit he
[4:13] said all of a sudden he was there pray
[4:15] that the Holy Spirit concluded between
[4:17] those trees and and he felt that
[4:20] anointing that sweet anointing and then
[4:23] he heard a voice saying if you say say
[4:27] would you come to us see he was walking
[4:32] with God but even even because I believe
[4:35] that was taught to impress
[4:38] this was it's all about progression in
[4:43] your pocket cup and you're gonna come
[4:45] into certain stages at your walk what
[4:48] God has never become more personal with
[4:50] you he's gonna speak to you he's going
[4:53] to intercede and intervene into
[4:55] situations if you give them the
[4:57] opportunity sometimes we get so busy
[4:59] with our own interpretation that we miss
[5:02] pop and we visited intercede intervening
[5:06] and dealing with the situations in their
[5:08] lives but you see that's what this and
[5:11] in parentheses and such a place of God
[5:14] that God came to him and was speaking
[5:19] and yet he was he was wondering is this
[5:23] is that humor his IQ that you said you
[5:27] have to be or something you said you
[5:28] wanted it you speak it work and that's
[5:31] what he spoke the squirrels and he says
[5:34] that that from that day on things
[5:36] changed in his life because he had
[5:39] witnessed and ever had such a personal
[5:42] encounter with God that woman in his
[5:45] life and it goes on and you know in here
[5:49] arena where he talks about here and in
[5:51] perfect faith in 1963 says know what the
[5:54] same God comes to you and is pleased to
[6:01] love you please to honor your work hey
[6:06] what your decision is see like think
[6:10] about this this kind of a walk you know
[6:13] about this kind of a walk where all of a
[6:16] sudden pleased with your decision and
[6:21] and he says what was Joshua's decision
[6:24] stand still son and it stood there I'm
[6:28] sure what was Moses
[6:46] [Music]
[6:59] [Music]
[7:10] [Music]
[7:30] [Music]
[7:38] [Music]
[7:40] and I know it is the truth
[7:43] save and see the Creator bring a living
[7:48] creature into existence right in the
[7:51] presence of your own eyes shake your
[7:56] head and look around and see them bring
[8:00] another one just exactly like he's
[8:03] talking about those burrows that
[8:05] experience because you said so and turn
[8:09] over here and say there'll be another
[8:11] one there
[8:12] that's the truth Oh where should we
[8:20] there's perfect a nomination just speak
[8:25] the word never saw us he just said this
[8:28] Richard wasn't speaking but you say
[8:34] it'll be there like to God at His Word
[8:36] and it was there meaning that's right
[8:39] that's just this powerful and friend as
[8:43] her pastor that's just as powerful as it
[8:46] was when Joshua stopped the Sun because
[8:50] the Sun was already there the others was
[8:53] moving and he stopped the movement but
[8:55] this he brought something there that
[8:57] wasn't there he created and this is the
[9:01] hour where God is creating God is
[9:04] positioning God is giving the Yeti God
[9:07] is giving you supernatural ability to
[9:10] change these vital bodies these mortal
[9:15] bodies that are going to be changed it's
[9:17] going to come through the preaching of
[9:18] the word of God
[9:19] it's going to come through you
[9:21] recognizing the season of the word what
[9:24] it is that's good he said I am so proud
[9:27] to be acquainted with God that God that
[9:30] can take this dust of the earth someday
[9:32] without anything and talking back to
[9:35] life again
[9:38] [Music]
[9:47] you said she believed it I'll do it and
[9:55] then listen you know I'm talking about
[9:57] this progression we don't write it down
[9:59] and this walk with God and I want you to
[10:05] see how it was happening in delight in
[10:09] Brother president because study the
[10:13] Prophet and you wanna you wanna you
[10:16] wanna listen to those tapes you wanna
[10:18] feel those tapes you know why do you
[10:20] wanna be on those tapes so that you can
[10:22] experience the same God that he was
[10:25] experiencing so that you can hear the
[10:28] things that he's saying about the dog
[10:30] that wants with you see this is what I
[10:34] said to you this is what I meant what I
[10:37] said I will be with you I will not
[10:40] forsake you I'll be with you until the
[10:43] end he says have courage be not be not
[10:46] dismayed be not discouraged I'll be with
[10:49] you but he told Joshua he's a single
[10:53] table
[10:55] probably one of those tapes your feet on
[10:59] to the right breezes because we've got
[11:01] that same walk you've got that same
[11:03] experience we've got that same desire
[11:29] and you're hearing the same God speaking
[11:32] through that top and with that problem
[11:35] and that's what's excitement and here he
[11:37] says in the message you know $1 will be
[11:40] the closing poll
[11:43] he says the message be not afraid as I
[11:48] believe that this is what we need to
[11:50] recognize that this day we need to
[11:52] realize that Jesus Christ wants to
[11:55] encourage you
[11:57] he wants to possess him he wants to use
[12:01] you he wants to change you he wants to
[12:04] so incarnate your life he wants you to
[12:07] just be soul filled and overflowing with
[12:11] this I just I just want more
[12:35] it is such a wonderful blessing to know
[12:38] the Lord Jesus as our sake and to know
[12:41] him as our human and looking for him to
[12:44] count as our king to set up the kingdom
[12:47] on earth that we shall rule and reign
[12:50] with him for a thousand years forever
[12:53] and now beaten tonight is rather pushing
[12:58] for the service of healing and praying
[13:00] to the sick we want to say I'd love to
[13:03] make this statement the reason I haven't
[13:05] I haven't had any human loves this week
[13:08] there's been something that's been on my
[13:10] heart as I told you the last time here
[13:14] there was a new ministry there was a new
[13:17] ministry coming he says I spoke with
[13:20] some of the Predators today and was
[13:22] telling them about what's happened just
[13:25] just some of the Brethren today was
[13:27] telling them about what's happened just
[13:30] remember that the first time I was here
[13:32] you remember the Lord had told me
[13:34] something was going to happen change in
[13:37] the ministry it happened said another
[13:40] loves blood to happen and it happened
[13:42] everything that God was telling brother
[13:45] Branham was speaking they had all the
[13:48] promises that he made they just kept
[13:51] coming to pass me and he was the sons
[13:54] and daughters the pride of the Pricer

[17:54] but even when you're angry
[17:57] see not projected which mean say Lord
[18:03] let the love of God take control over
[18:06] this feeling let the love of God take
[18:10] control over this this situation and
[18:14] this is holding this fabulous partner or
[18:19] or in this healing situation with the
[18:22] sickness Allah protects us
[18:26] it'll just relate so much to you that
[18:30] God just flows because God is God if
[18:41] you've got a revelation of God's love
[18:43] you know that it's not filled up maybe
[18:45] that doesn't please God it's not popping
[18:49] up maybe that's the kind of love that
[18:52] the musicians come that's the kind of
[18:55] apocalypse the kind of love that changes
[19:00] you and changes your character when
[19:04] people see they can feel they can feel

[19:20] them
[19:20] we've heard it sometimes Christians they
[19:23] can get soul into battles and they
[19:26] become more miserable than happening and
[19:28] it starts to become a part of their
[19:31] character
[19:32] word word you know you don't even want
[19:35] to be around because you can feel the
[19:36] misery
[19:38] I'll beg God to have people like that in
[19:41] this church
[19:43] don't worry doc but you know you know
[19:47] you see it out there and I'm just
[19:49] talking about that same kind of spirit

[19:58] are the happiest people on earth I'm
[20:02] talking about Jesus Loves Me jesus loves
