god i'm so grateful i'm so thankful that you made a way for us to be here lord search my heart don't leave mine out and say the heart of your children if any one of us has disbelieved you in any way shape or form father we ask for forgiveness because the blood of christ it washes us from all unbelief father may your spiritual control take me aside help me to say something that will help your children father anything all id we come against it in the name of jesus christ may your great holy ghost have permanence with the same pillar of fire that was following the prophet ministry may come and speak to our heart again but i thank you for the victory in jesus name amen and i think we continue the same scripture we are doing the part two of praying throughout the day and the scripture i used that time was ephesians 6 18. um grace do you have that slide on ephesians 6 18 yeah it says that pray in the spirit at all times with all kinds of prayers ask them for everything you need to do this you must always be ready and never give up and always pray for all god's people please be seated and the other time we talk about it we talk about praying all that because we have um two types of prayer that you can do through your day one day you make a schedule another one that is a continuous prayer throughout the day and i think breakfast i forgot but chris was able to clarify it more right by saying that this is not a law i had wanted to say that at times and it's not like in stone or you don't want a situation that when you're going to work and you've slept you're going to felt guilty that you didn't pray so you want to take all those elements out and make sure that we're doing this by the grace and the love of god and the prophet of god all said that if you make a schedule time and you pray consistently respect god will meet you on those times if you're on time the angel of god will be there before you so it has to be taken in balance you don't want to like go on way off so that's why i was i wanted to bring our attention to it and back to that i remembered one time i went to a barber shop and then in the baba shop something came up and i talked about lord says right no man i don't say the best something came so i have to speak and somebody just came in and he had a conversation he said i wanted to have against christians is that they said that if you don't go to church you go to hell you go to church you go to heaven and i said oh you speak the wrong person because i'll go through a pastor has thought it's right and not only has the personal thought there's everything god has also revealed to me so it has become personalized to me so i can talk like on first and experience and i said no um you're talking the wrong person because yes i go to church yes i paid my sight yes i paid my offering yes i do all those things but i'm not doing it as a duty and i'm not doing because i want to escape hell i'm doing this because i love god if i look what the lord has done for me he left all his throne the beauty everything that he had he left it and came down to shed his blood to save as soon as i said such as i nothing that i can do to pay him back so this little things that i do i do it out of appreciation of my heart for what god has done for me i can't pay him back i ordered that i could not pay you know so as i spoke in that fight the guy said my goodness i haven't heard this in this passion before now you're hearing it amen our god is awesome praise god so um just to recap we talk about praying all the time having the schedules and then you also talk about um why it's important that you try to pray in the morning because um they have make research to show that your attitude during the first eight minutes in the morning affect the rest of your day and then you also talk about how you have to put god's face the kingdom of god with the elisha and all those things so today we're gonna move further on give me slight number 20. slide number 20. i think i said give us today our daily bread okay yeah okay that's fine so it's said yeah give us our daily bread yeah my two sisters living and then the way he did they said in the lunch time that's where you have to list your petitions the things that you have need of and the bread type so many things you have the bread of life breath for our natural substances you need the bread to eat breast like a food and the bible said that mind shall not eat by bread alone but by every word that came out from the word of god so bread is important without you eating a day or without you taking natural food in your system you're going to die you cannot survive you can survive without food for a couple of years days or weeks but you can't survive without water so you need bread in your life to sustain you naturally so in the spiritual realm you need the bread of god the word of god and it has to be balanced and i was thinking about it and last week a thought came to my mind someone who didn't want to take the the shot the vaccine and the scripture came to my heart was they were saying that when he said that fear not who will kill this body fear was able to destroy both the body and soul so what is happening is that people are putting so much emphasis on the natural body which there's nothing wrong taking care of your body but it doesn't matter how much you take care of this body one day you're gonna leave it on the ground you we take care of faith we i do outside but it's important but no matter how you take care of it one day you're gonna leave it here but the bible said they saw that senate that social died so you need to feed on the word of god for your sustenance of your soul because man shall not live on bread alone but on everywhere that proceeds out of the mouth of god as a revelation of the world that's what you need to keep your spiritual active amen so you have to take into consideration and have a balanced life hey man we not want people to be too much spiritual and not good in the natural life and we don't want to be too much natural or not goodness spiritual life they always they have to be a balance amen so they have to have to balance both your natural and your spiritual life so you need the word of god and the scriptures give us our this day our daily bread that means that the present truth present daily bread the word for today not yesterday where do not do because the children of israel the mana they were supposed to eat it fresh and don't keep it for the next day the next day is going to be perish so you need the manner for the day the present truth the present stage of his ministry it is not the s-u-n day son of god day sunday is a cess or end day when he resurrected on the first day of the week who is the eighth day which is the eighth day the eternal church age now is the mighty angel riding the trail through the bride once more amen because not we fiscally in the seventh eighth the nordician they said that you are so changed didn't it the spirit is your source on the eighth day eternal church and back to the first day it was the eighth day so we are no more in the seventh the body you are so um you say change that you are living you say you are in heaven sit in heavenly places in christ jesus amen so we are not the mighty angel who is riding the trail through the bride of christ amen praise god that god was in the prophet of god and that same god who was the prophet of god when god took his prophet he didn't take his spirit and that's why elisha asked elijah i want a double portion of your spirit amen so it's elijah elijah it's elijah time now it's a spirit of christ in the bride the same god who was in the prophet is that same god leading the bride again because it says that this marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready amen praise god so it's a present stage of his ministry eagles eat fresh food hallelujah the man that fell for luke will not work for today the one that fell for wesley was not for our day the one that went for pentecost is not going to work for a day it is a present stage of his ministry amen and on the day of pentecost they were justified they were satisfied they were filled the holy ghost him and the bride of christ also are justified in the sight of god we are satisfied we have the baptism all over you have the holy ghost himself in the bride leading him to walk back to god again amen so you need that fresh the fresh anointing the fresh way because we are in a different age so you need that present truth to confront your day without that you can't make it amen because the eagles can go all high the house will just fall and vote as on on the word of god the freshman of god for today amen eternal church is a said mighty angel was in the revelation 1 came into revelation revelation 10 1 came to revelation 10 7 to reveal the seals amen is the mighty angel amen that is eternal church age hallelujah praise god thank you jesus hallelujah give me slide number 21 grace okay so my name is okay you said that you can ask for anything i need okay go to slide 22. yes you can ask for anything in my name hallelujah why you can ask for anything in mind anything you ask my name you'll get it so what is happening is that as the beginning of this 40-day series bradley advised us to write all our needs is that right so this one is the bank of heaven and pastor gave us this about a couple of years ago and i can testify of faith that everything that i wrote on it it might not happen on that same day or but after a while i go back to check all those things i wrote that back of chairman check everything came forth i can see god manifest himself through all that amen and god used blood um tim last week to let us know that god doesn't always say yes sometimes you say no but if you really love god you will also rejoice the same way he say no and yes your rejoice has to be the same that shows your love of god amen because whether i say no yes you're still gonna rejoice anyhow anyways because it's the same yesterday today and forever so he said you can ask for anything in my name i will grant it there's nothing that god do not grant for you so you have to if you have written things down and has not been met yet don't give up keep them there and pray over it it will come to pass one day those things you see them happen because your prayers he said god will say yes or sometimes you can say wait and sometimes no so i wrote them i wrote a lot and i can testify of that god gave i said every one of them after years back i'll go back and i read them so wow so if you have some you can still write them if you don't have it that's fine so i read this quotation here um yeah twenties whatsoever you asked the father in my name i will do it every promise in the books belongs to you when you are saved he gives you a check with his name wrote at the bottom of it that check was there his name was sweetheart don't be afraid to fill it out cause the bank of heaven will recognize it if it goes through the pentecostal clearing house see that's right see if you got something here on your deposit yourself if you are recognized if you got identification to show that check belongs to you it's only for believers now if you got that identification why god will recognize your check that's right no matter what you ask for any redemptive blessings belongs to you amen hallelujah oh that redemptive blessing belongs to you amen praise so ask for anything and god will grant it to you and if your motive is right and your objective is right god will grant it why do you want god to heal you some people they want god to heal them and go back to dance it won't work all the people i'm just speaking the people on the youtube like wherever you are you want god to heal you you have to give me a reason hezekiah told god that i need 15 years more to what to prepare my house so you must have a reason why you want god to do certain things for you and if that reason lines up with his word and your motive is right your objective is right god will grant it to you it doesn't matter what it is he's more than able to what answer all your requests that's why i said if you ask anything in my name i will grant it to you so no matter what you have made of tonight you ask him he's able to grant all your needs because my god has never changed he's the same yesterday today and forever he will not give some people ice cream and you come there he's gonna give you a different thing you give me the same if you come the same that's why he told ken if you have done what your brother has done i will have answered your request i will have a testify of yours so he will show him to follow what is better date so if you are doing stuff if you see god is blessing somebody and the way the person that if you go that same way and you have right objective god is able to give it to you because it's not an indian giver he will give you something take it back and he give to others he'll give it to you too amen because god loves everybody he's he's not like um what do you call some parents that have their favorites or this he loves us all the same he treats us all the same you come the same way he's gonna treat you exactly by the word of god so the word is the main thing the revelation of the word how much the word has revealed to you and how much you can take it's according to the level of your faith some people have that fail to receive one billion one million some must have a little faith maybe thousand ten times is enough for them so it depends on how much you want it depends on how much you can take and also god will give you something that's going to be a burden on you he knows what you can take he knows how what you can handle so we give you according to the measure of your faith so that i don't be a burden on you it won't be something to be a stumbling block amen he's awesome god hallelujah our god is good praise god hallelujah amen grace give me slight 24 hope i'm on the same page with you okay so that's right so i'll be standing against the lord if i fail to pray for you as believers we need to pray for one another it's very very important that satisfies somebody say that i'll be saying against the lord if i fail to pray for you because sometimes we got caught up in our own word in our own situation and forget about the need of others so we need to pray for one that is very very important and then i think give me 24 24 25. i could go 25. okay you missed this one that's fine um he said that as for what other people need to intersection you need to intercede for one another the intersection you need to intercede the intercession is the spirit of christ one time the children of israel they were wrong as wrong can be but moses with a spirit of christ in him he intercedes at god before you destroy them destroy me the same intercession spirit that was on abraham when the time came for god to destroy sodom and gomorrah that people in sodom were as strong as strong can be but abraham with the spirit of christ in him he interceded and plead with the angel if you can find 50 will you destroy this city and they just say no yes if i found it i would not destroy it and there was no 50 righteous i wonder what time are we living in when everything that is good is now treated as bad and the bad has become good what time are we living insane is worse than that time now but there were spirit of intercession the spirit of god in abrahamic seed is also crying out for abraham was was at the back of his mind of his fault of his falling knee and his fallen nephew lord he didn't want not to be destroyed with the unrighteous the bible said that the sin of sodom verse lord soul i wonder how many lots are living in this time that the people are scared to even stand for the truth because of their belly just for the natural life they're scared to tell the truth but truth is only one you have only one truth that's the word of god what we obey the loss of the land don't get me wrong but if the loss of the land is contrary to the bible we're gonna go by what this bible says because our absolute is the bible that's what we stand for this is the absolute so if the law of the land is contrary to this we stand by this and the same god that sued for daniel sued for the shadrach music that same god will stand for his children when he stands for his word because if you stand for him he will stand for you here over there if you are ashamed of god he was gonna be ashamed of god of you amen if you are ashamed to stand for him he's going to be ashamed to stand for you we have to stand for god we have to stand for the word of god because he said fear him not who is able to destroy just the body but the one that can destroy the body soul and the spirit so it's time to stand for the word of god and he will stand for you that's why and one of the story that abraham said about after mccoy pronounced the name right when he had a dream then the the angel asked him did you lie on this on the earth he said he thought i have been truth and honest about it but in the presence of that light he realized that some views that he didn't do it right he said did you steal historically never stole but in the presence of that like little things it all flashes he was about to tend to go to their condemnation but the voice said father forgive him on end he stood for me and i'm also standing for him so all that god is requiring is to stand for the lord jesus christ here don't worry about your mistakes mistakes we make mistakes he understands you are in this flesh he understands or makes you understand the way we are born and everything he understands his flesh but all that he wants is that stand for me stand for jesus get as many as you can for the lord pray for this pray for the sick pray for your brothers and sisters intercede for them and god will take care of the of his business amen because nobody can follow the ten commandments by the lord what is guilty the grace of god grace grace grace amazing grace grace that is greater than all my sins is a grace that is taking us through it's not your self-righteousness his righteousness that is in you and me amen so don't worry about this flesh because the flesh will go wherever it came from anyway but the soul in the mind yeah you that matters praise our wonderful god amen hallelujah praise god okay grace give me 26. okay okay yeah 27 27 do not get anxious about anything yeah do not get anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your request to god and the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guide your hearts and your minds in christ jesus amen that means you got to pray in the spirit you got to be in the spirit last week i was telling the prophet saying that all that you need brother sister just prayed up and go during the day god will take care of your business you will be in the presence of god he will take care of your business it doesn't matter what bread up and relax and god will take control because when you are on the line of duty he'll be there for you because moses was on line of deity when they were crossing the red sea and their sea was all up they couldn't go anywhere but in the line of duty he cried out and god said i just use your rod and pat directly it brings me to two and then when they went to the middle there was the enemy here rest in here amen if he goes back these guys the details are on their truth and this happened they were after them when they went the other side and god said use that sin again and then it swallowed all the egyptians so and on the point of duty god will take your business all you have to do is just spray it up and just live your life don't worry about anything god will take control amen because joshua was also on the point of duty and you understand he says son stands too still sansa understands truth why because he was on the point of duty so you are on the point of duty because remember god is interested in everything that we are doing the steps of righteousness are ordered of the lord so once you are making yourself to work wherever you are going during the day god is very mindful about you he cares about you he loves you he cares to take care of your business so you just give everything to me in the morning go don't worry he will bring things to pass he'll bring your desires to pass amen just a day before i say that i was talking to somebody i tried that oh man i need to get somebody's number i did something i want to make things right and for yes i'm trying to get hold of their number and just this one when i woke up somebody called me and i said well i need this time i said fair so i can't get it just i give me that right away i got in contact with that person because god knows that i wanted to get in touch with that person and talk to her and god made their way it i never even thought about i'll get the number today but because it was just in my mind and i told somebody god supernaturally make a way for me to get that contact yeah i've been looking for him for more than 10-15 years and i can't get hold of that i tried i really went to ghana asked the persons and cousins they don't have it everywhere i can get it so i was just telling somebody on the door i wish i could get this number and yeah i am this morning god's financially let me have the hood of number god is very interested in every little thing of our lives so just leave everything in god's hands he will bring it to pass don't worry about tomorrow tomorrow will take care of itself in the high calling of god brethren said that just god will provide your needs daily from his unseen treasury just live your life just be happy as this monster all the time just be happy be glad in the lord what it's like you are here today with god tomorrow don't let nothing bother you be free we feel the son of man has set free is free indeed amen let nothing hold you back enjoy praise god worshiping amen give him the glory give him thanks amen he's the god of the good times the god of the bad times amen hallelujah when things go wrong you make them right hallelujah praise god god is awesome safarina amen he's wonderful god he's the same yesterday today and forever amen i'm not worried for nothing because i know papa god will take your business he said business taking care of god amen oh my brother eugene just rejoice in the lord amen hallelujah praise god just be just be in the spirit just pray and go he will take your business hallelujah praise our god amen and amen amen hallelujah grace give me 28 yes ask for forgiveness in the afternoon confessions hallelujah i was talking somebody last couple of weeks a week ago said and she was saying that somebody has to forgive somebody and i say how can the person forgive if the spirit of forgiveness is not in heaven you need god and you need to forgive if somebody just said i forgive from their lips doesn't mean nothing that forgiveness has to come from the heart amen so we just can't tell people forgive forgive forgive something in them has to be willing to give that forgiveness you don't push people forgiveness or by revelation the people has to forgive from the depth of their heart and you don't press and pressure people and they will just do it to please you but might be sky in their in their heart because what is happening that god has the ability to forgive and forget maybe as a human being we can forgive but we don't have that thing to forget so if the person doesn't have that grace to forgive you just leave them let god deal with your heart at the right time they will do it and everybody will be free amen so it all has to be done by revelation because anything done without faith is sin amen hallelujah forgive us our sins as we forgive those who forgive sin against us hallelujah praise god and give me 30 30 admit my sins and forgive others who frustrated me the thing of it is some people they don't want to be what we sell it say it some people when they are wrong they don't want to accept it they want to always go around things work work around the bush they don't go they don't go right to their source that made their fault if you have that mistake with that mistake just be a money now for a lady enough is that enough to accept your mistakes and admit it you have to be honest with yourself that's why you stand 50 when i say that um there's some 51 here 51. yeah i just want to use the right way that i want to use he said 51 behold thou desires the truth in the inward past in the hidden path that shall make me to know wisdom so desires the truth in the inward part if inside of you you admit the truth that little voice it reminds you that you are wrong you have to accept it and make it right if it's your brother or sister go to him make it right just accept it just admit it don't try to be too high one time the prophet lied and he accepted his line told the person and the person respected him more than before he said i respected you more than before why because he had made his mistakes you admit it and go for it don't also let feel guilty felt have anybody conscious let things go amen praise our god give me 31. blessed is huge transgressions forgiving okay some said psalm 32 verse 24 he said that blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputed not iniquity and whose prayer there is no girl when i kept silenced by both works would do my roaring all the day long for day and night the hand was heavier for me my muscles turned into drought of summer stila okay as we spoke the other time we're saying that the letter killing when the spirit give life if the spirit of god that quickens the letter to you without that is just a letter and one time in my christian work i made a mistake and i was down very down because we were praying for a situation fasting and praying and i went to work outside supervisor on that time and i have a co-supervisor and he did something that make me very angry and i was fascinating pray on that day for a big situation so it only came face to face between me and him and people has to intervene to separate us and when i get home i was so down and i was so like felt guilty for destroying what we are doing and god is my witness when i opened this bible it went to romans 8 4 he said that blessed is the man whom i will not impute sin and whose iniquity is forgiven then everything was wrong all the guilt everything was wrong like that amen the spirit of god to contradict and from that time i have confidence no matter what i done no matter how i did mistake that scripture always comes back to me that blesses them whom i who are not imputing whose iniquity is for god is my witness the scripture just the bible just went right in my heart you know how your heart and how to express when something pops up and that scripture has been with me like david said he realized that the same god that delivered the lion and and the bear to him is able to take off or circumcise philistine and that scripture always comes up anytime i'm in trouble anytime i have any situation it just kind of builds me up that god will not impulsing against his own self amen because i'm part of him hallelujah and the brabram said of this over here he said that first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose of god can give us lightening to you first of all we know most assuredly that the purpose god stands in election it was purpose in himself it was god's purpose to bring forth people like unto himself that would be a red bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the earth she was redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in judgment because sin cannot be imputed onto her romance eight for it blessed is the man to whom lord will not impute sin so god will not imprison to you because you are part of him you make mistake on the flesh but don't worry about the flesh he will not impute anything to his attribute you are part of him amen and somewhere he said that you are justified you didn't even do it in the first place amen you never have as you have done nothing you are justified by faith so don't look at your mistakes don't look down upon yourself because god do not impute things to you hey man that's sin less bride you wouldn't do it in the first place you are justified amen our god is awesome so don't feel guilty some people every little thing they feel guilty about it though just brush it off just repent and move out your life all that god wants you to tell lord i'm sorry you admit it you die something against somebody my dad always tells me it was a film even if you have to take somebody to call for a situation you want the person to admit their fault so if you know you have wronged somebody don't wait to go to court settle the person tell the truth just be honest just live your life and don't drag things and god will bless you amen because he will not impute sin against you and if you read down there he said that but she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels here named each of her members was written in the session of the lamb's book of life before the foundations of this world amen so you are sinless bride don't be scared to judge nevertheless because you're going to judge over on the other side amen hallelujah said that he that believes this shall pass has far from death into life and shall not come onto condemnation judgment begins at the house of god now the word of god is judging us and taking away any lessons from us that sound like him slowly so little by little amen hallelujah praise our god so what that so don't get down don't let nothing worry you because as a son or daughter of god there's nothing that god will not forgive you the only thing god should not forgive the blasphemy of the holy ghost and a son or daughter of god cannot and will never be will never bless him against god so what are you worried about you are justified those on the youtube land i'm telling you you are justified don't feel guilty about anything repent and go forward just be honest because god wants truth in the hidden path in the inward path that's where god requires the truth i'd rather be right in my heart inward than the outside i don't care what anybody thinks about you whatever talks about me once my heart is right with god and once i make things right i don't care about anything you are wearing yourself for nothing i want to make sure i'm right with my maker that's the most important thing amen that's why david said i ran at god god judge me that human being because there's a forgiveness with him he's a loving father christ amen but you human being know i want to make sure i make things right with my maker it's very important to me than anything else amen praise our god hallelujah slice 33 i think the same that i confess my sin to you and didn't try to hide them then you forgive me and now all my guilt is gone that is your sins have been thrown into the world the sea of god forgetfulness he doesn't even remember them anymore so don't let nothing worry you little bride somewhere enjoy he said that even if your heart condemns you god is greater than your heart amen hallelujah so don't let nothing condemn because you can't approach god the condemnation that's why the master if your heart condemns you not ask anything and i'll grant it to you so god doesn't want us to feel condemnation i believe that's why he gave me that scripture to let not from that blessing that my whom i would not in peace but that time i was feeling so i was feeling so condemned oh god i've done this that he came at the right time and let me out from it amen and he will do the same thing to you he doesn't want you to feel condemned to feel guilty not because he came to take our guilt on the cross so that we can become him he became us he was not guilty guiltless but he came take our guilty upon him so nobody take any guilt upon him or herself because that guilt is gone already and do you know that even a true son or daughter of god when you do something wrong god hasn't been hold it against you because he knew that down the road you make sense right so he forgives you in advance hallelujah praise our god so you are justified in christ jesus amen praise our god by bill amen hallelujah yes sir okay so i'm just gonna work to wrap up very soon give me 34. okay okay he said that ask for the help ask for to help me make wise decisions decisions are very very important because your present condition that you are in is based on the scene you made five years ago in the next five years decisions gonna make now will determine your your next stage so decisions are very very important that's why brabrand preached about the greatest battle ever fought because that's because these things take place over here and because this thing takes place over here there's always a battle so before you make every decision you got to take the lord in prayer that's why joseph at one time forgot about himself and he was just carried away by the situation then he was not go to the wall but he asked have you prayed have you consulted god and when god was consulted you realize that all those 400 prophets were lying and there was only one mayaka who has the truth amen the same thing happened in our prophet's life when four hundred of them pentecost are there to challenge him on the doctrine of the separate student baptism in the name of our lord jesus christ he said that i'm standing here the angels behind me who can come and refuse what i'm saying he said you can't come because you're not scared of me you're scared of that angel that is behind me and that same mighty angels here with us who do you think was with peter who took him from the prisons or the angel of god paul when they were going to have a shipwreck he said a chair up the angel of india came to me and spoke to me that none of you will be perished that who was behind brad brown ministry towards god the angel of god that same angel of god is here with us tonight if thou canst believe all things are possible to tempt that belief because the same mighty angel is with the bride again doing the exact same thing he did hallelujah so you you have to pray over your decisions it's very very vital amen because the greatest battle goes on in the mind it's your thought god knows every thought that passed through our mind even right now whatever is going through your mind god is aware of it amen and somebody said oh i cannot do nothing by the thought yes yes some thoughts will come contrast to god read but he said that the bear don't let it nest on your heart on it he doesn't have to you can just refuse it reject it the bible said that resist the devil and what he will flee you you you cannot prevent them from coming but you can also let do not allow them to nest on you don't feed on those thoughts feed on god's thoughts what are the thoughts of god said whatsoever things that are of good report whatsoever things that edifies if there are any virtues think on those things those are things that i defies change the identifies things that will draw you to christ as they think on these things that god appeared on them on their way to do what in miles they were thinking about him they were talking about him god likes to hear talk about him let's talk about jesus the king of king supreme why is he talking about him you appear amen he's awesome people wasting their time to gossip spend their time with him talk about him think about him and you appear because the same years later forever when he appeared he break the bread and the eyes were open amen that same god is here tonight to break the bread again so that our eyes can open amen to see the word when the well resurrected what part are you is it resurrected in you where path was the path amen because when it was resurrected they were thinking about him we were talking about the past he said that all slow and full of was it slow and slow and what slow and full is whatever it is have you forgot this this this that he revealed it back to them and when you break the bread the eyes pop up oh they knew it was him and he vanished is it the same thing yes is that breaking the price even and time again their bride is preparing for her mate to meet hey man harlow is even in time again he's the same yesterday and forever amen his evening time breaking the bread when he see all things going on because remember i was telling someone the bible says it's going to get worse and worse cold it's never going to go back it's poured ever backwards never so we we're not going back we're going forward it's getting worse dark out there and the spirit of god is also moving mightily in his children amen is a battle going on now between right and wrong between liberty and and and bondage it's your choice amen because the battle is going on right now it's getting dark every day but there is a light coming off that light is only in the bride of christ amen they are the only one that god has also revealed himself more in them becoming flesh because people are looking for the word back then but they forgot that the word has put on flesh and on two feet again walking amen on two feet again the same god he's in his bride doing the exact same thing he they are putting in the future they are putting in the past and they can talk more about the past but they forgot what he existed who would deny that christ has not come in the flesh is of the antichrist he's in the flesh now in his bread he's the same god so it's very very vital that we consult god in every decision that we make amen praise god i'll be wrapping up very soon okay he said i remember that the temptations that come into your life um 36 grace remember that the temptations that come into your life are no different from what others experience and god is faithful he will keep the temptation from becoming so strong that you can stand up against it when you are tempted you show you a way out so that you not giving in to it in other words god will not give you anything that you cannot bear he know your limits he will give you more that you can you can carry so anything that comes your way know that god is take care of you know your capacity you know your capability know what he has placed in you that's overcome because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world the overcoming power dwells in you so you overcome everything you overcome death and everything you're going to overcome everything through you too because he that overcometh will also sit with me at my throne amen that that overcoming power is in you so no matter what come your way you have to have confidence that it's not there to kill you it's there to shape you up it's there to prepare you you pressurize when the people are going toward the soldiers they train them very hard they go through all sorts of training for the battle so when the battle comes they know what they are going through the train because even if you check the natural life the basketball players and other things those that excel very much they say that they go beyond the regular people they go they get the practice before everybody gets their the last person to leave so your preparation is praying and reading the bible every day and listening the word of god when you make that preparation it will show up if you are not preparing that area it's gonna show up people will see when the battle comes it will say how if you can stand or not amen so you got to be you got to be trained you have to be trained for battle amen hallelujah our god is good amen now i'll be just wrapping up with this last thought you see i'll refuse to look at anything that is vile and vulgar and the last one end my day with an encouraging truth benediction that means that before you go to bed you got to pray and give god thanks for everything that went through the day and those sometimes you're all guilty just two three minutes you go back to bed but you got to pray up and give god the benediction just give him praise give him the honor and the glory amen amen blessings and glories thanksgiving belongs to god he he deserves our praise of our worship you just thank him for his grace for his mercy for taking care of friends throughout the day oh hallelujah even when i was coming with my daughter that was a big accident he said daddy how can this happen i says god that is keeping us we
