updated as to what is really happening but for tonight we will speak on the topic of the the gift of God the gift of God or God's gift to us for the gift of God is eternal life praise the Lord a gracious Heavenly Father we thank you we thank you this evening for the wonderful words of life as we read from Romans 6 23 uh tonight Lord may your Holy Spirit hover over the word of God may your great spirit go forth in the Lands Beyond wherever our voice is heard and father May the influence of the power of the Gospel endure and let it reach Those whom he is supposed to reach Lord may the great Holy Spirit minister to us everyone and lift us up open our hearts father straighten us father we commit ourselves to thee now yielding for service and may we all have a wonderful time feasting upon youth we ask it in Jesus name with all the praise to you father amen from The Book of Romans chapter 6. verse 23 one of the early verses that I remember memorizing this when I was just still a boy uh one of the first scriptures you memorize and it reads for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord now it says here in the margin that the literal translation of that is for the gift of God is eternal life in Jesus Christ our Lord if you're in him then you have eternal life because he is eternal life there is no other eternal life he is the one that is eternal oh praise God please be seated amen well I'm talking about God's gift to you God God's gift to me uh uh and the nominal Christian will say God's gift to us eternal life is to us because Jesus died on Calvary and now we can repent of our sins we can confess our all and we will be freely forgiven and we will receive eternal life through repentance and confession before God and that is what we also believed for a very long time according to church doctrines and teachings which we might have heard but we have come to understand by the ministry of the Holy Spirit through an anointed Prophet for our day bringing the word of God to us but that word was not revealed by him that word has been revealed individually to each one of us and we have come to recognize that we do not now receive eternal life because we repent felt guilty confessed her our sins at the altar we do not now receive eternal life we have come to understand that Eternal means eternal it means without beginning and without ending and therefore we could not now receive eternal life it means that we always had eternal life but only now have come to recognize that we have that eternal life now our scripture here is simple one of the simplest sounding scriptures in the Bible amen when it says but the gift of God is eternal life well you see God is your eternal and from him having sons and having daughters and they're being a part of him they're being the stars of the morning they're being the one the stars that praised him glorified him and magnified him in the heavens where they sang and shouted and praised His holy name we find out that those Stars those ones were God's genes and the gift of God to us is that he gave you I and any who can recognize it he gave them from the very beginning they were a part of himself that Gene is a part of himself but we have only come to recognize it now in this age by the ministry of Malachi 4 5. we have heard the word of God Amen praise the Lord and I want you to know why did he give you uh this Gene why did he allow you to have this and to be here on the earth because you see he needed somebody something to identify the word for the day [Music] he wanted a deep that could call back to the Deep he wanted something that could respond to his word not with a fictional illusion in their minds not by human education or teaching not by any of these things in the world not by being smart but by Supernatural communication by the power of the holy spirit in the life of a True Believer amen where were Angels could uh come like Jacob going up and down coming up and down its Revelation messages from God revealing himself to his children Revelation going back and forth and Satan knows nothing about it he doesn't have a part of it and he can't get in there but we are brought in Praise the Lord hallelujah amen so the gene was genes were sent to Earth here in Parts portions so that in every age he would have a witness he would have someone he would have a people that have a gift in them that could identify him that could turn around and I identify him and we know when we say him back then it identified him the word in flesh praise God but now the word for form that he's in now we with that Gene in us are to be able to identified the revealed word of the hour now at one point no one to a Dogma it will not point you to a Creed at one point to do anything contrary to the word because it's only it's part of God Amen and being a part of God it will point you back to the world always to the word listen Christ in this day that we live in now is here identifying himself he said what is it it's deity amongst the people see it is the word living word amen and he is identifying himself because he is that word amen see we see the Living Word itself now because of that how do you see this word because of the gene of God being in you only the gene could recognize the word praise God so he says now clearly you see ah deity therefore is being identified in man Hallelujah then now it's the same thing today that's happening deity ID identifying itself in man praise God hallelujah you are identifying him he is identifying you in other words that's what's going on right now praise the name of the Lord and He is identifying himself like he did when he came in flesh trying to identify himself that he is the Messiah word he is the word made flesh to them and those elected predestinated seeds disciples that were upon the face of the Earth quickly they recognize that was the word for their day that was the word of God the full illness of the word of God see the promised word now the same thing that deity and this promised word for this day can can identify itself to you that is in you Hallelujah then when you see that you hold to it you believe it you give it deity in other words you recognize that that's a part of deity inside of you amen deity hallelujah oh my oh praise God you want to give his service and you want to be ready to dial to yourself on your own thoughts so that he can identify himself in you praise God hallelujah oh my now remember God guided the Meiji with their gifts for practically two years they followed that star amen oh praise God it was God guiding them see and it crossed at Bethany him but notice carefully God guided them because they had the right gift with gifts with them and that is why you and I when we were still like like the wise men were out in the desert they're going but they don't know where they're going but but because in this age with all the madness and the Mayhem and the murder and all that's going on around us and all the worldliness and all the immorality and everything else that's out there God guided you amen hallelujah not only he guided you but like the prophet when he went up that electric pool and could have died from the electric wires oh friend not only did he guide us but he protected us because of that gift that was in US yeah robbers could have robbed them moving with all those expensive gifts moving with all these things which was a normal thing to be robbed but somehow they were guided and they were protected because they were predestinated to arrive at their destination and their destination was to come to the place where the world was and to identify that word praise the lord lord of God hallelujah amen praise God see God guided those wise men because they had the right identified gifts in them and them gifts there could identify his son identify the word made flesh amen the gifts that they had praise God aren't you glad that God has given us those that kind of a gift inside of us for the gift of God is eternal life [Applause] in Jesus Christ Our Lord praise be to God hallelujah amen you see he guided them because they had the right gift to identify his son praise God hallelujah and so will it be today with a wise man today of this hour amen hallelujah not not wise in the name of the Lord but not with some fictitious something not with some wisdom out of man's School amen but man who has been given God's Gift in them and that gift in them leads them and guides them they listen praise God I'm so thankful that the path of a you're just man praise God it will guide us to the perfect light and how that the steps of a man are ordained of God they're predestinated every step everything you do God has planned and purpose your life in such a way for his glory if you want to when you have time at home you can look into a man that can turn on the light page 18 page 19 praise God and then go over to page 53 of course you can read the entire uh uh book of an or sermon but those will be some things that can give you some more understanding of this praise God you see them man today wise In The Name Of The Lord not with some fictitious something but with that gift of God that he promised would be here for this day praise the Lord and that will guide you to identify that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today where not just today in the written word of the Bible but Jesus Christ is the same today living in you and in me praise God because Jesus Christ was what the word living in flesh for that day but now the word has come again in the bright form living in flesh for this day so it is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today now and forever praise be to God hallelujah amen see amen now God guided those gifts because there were gifts to be used to identify him so we were planned and purposed to be here in this age at this time to be able to identify the word of God oh praise God hallelujah oh yes wise men of today pay attention to nothing else because they look away from all Church reality they look away from everything else praise God they look away from the things of the world to see the Living Word making itself manifest Lord of God then look away from everything else not that they don't see it but they look away from it because they have eyes looking upon the word isn't that what he preached Look Away to Jesus look away hallelujah praise be to God Amen see God will identify his son by his word and that's what he is I and my father are one you'll see you are identifying now that you're a part of that word and that part of that word is in you and that you have come to recognize you are not separate you are not something far away but you are brought nine Paul said you are brought nigh by this Revelation to recognize that I and my father are one he is the word I'm a part of the word amen he is eternal I am Eternal praise God I come from God and I go back to God this is what I'm telling you the gift of God is eternal life praise God now praise the Lord you should recognize by now he's telling you no matter what you got to go through here no matter what they do to you while you don't hear no matter what pain what pressure what problems you suffer amen you'll come from God and you're going back to God you're just on a journey amen you're going to face mountains valleys rivers to cross but you are going back home to God hallelujah amen I am my father are one do you see it listen in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was God oh my brothers half of our hearts expanded big enough to have be able to receive that and understand who we are we of course he says these ones he says I have said ye are gods and that you are children of the most high brother Branham says amateur Gods he says a small Messiah X amen praise God and it's not just you're talking it or you're just saying it one can say it but if you are confident if you have Assurance if you are certain of God and you'll know what is in you then you you know that you are a part of him revealed all these scintillating lights from the presence of God he is the father of all these lights we are part of him praise God your word made flesh and that word that was made flesh dwelt Among Us it's dwelling among us again it is our right now praise God and I'm happy I'm a part of it praise the name of the Lord amen what do you think he says it's the same word today glory to God he's the same yesterday to the end of and forever and a truly wise man follows that amen hallelujah because that's what God takes care of to identify himself by that amen that's why God is taking care of you doesn't matter what goes on in your life he is in the shadows watching over his own he says just like the Great Eagle sitting on the high mountain side under little uh chicks are in the valley floor you you would think that they're down there hopping and skipping and going around at a wolf or something else could come and grab one of them he says but no because with those eagle eyes she sees even a mouse moving in the grass any one of those things start coming nearby he said she'll swoop down praise God and and just get a hold of them and we are glad we have a God that can swoop down in our situation our eyes and take care of our problems and lead us and guide us for his name's sake amen hallelujah think of it that God hides and takes care of them gifts to identify himself by them hallelujah oh praise God Amen a gift think of it real identified gifts of God God brings that to the earth a thing like that and he brings it to identify himself by of course we take that compound that speaks of the Prophet that speaks of us and whoever may come after us God uses that and Portion out the the why you know it tells me here now that the Azure went forth to sow and some fell here some fell there some fell over there I don't know some fell in this age some fell in the other age whatever but they fell and they come up at their appropriate seasons and times to fulfill the word of God for that hour that they are living in praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and see the real identified gifts of God God brings that to Earth and it brings it to identify himself by it glory to God what an important job and Mission you have what an important task you have John the Baptist task was what point to the word and say Behold the Lamb of God that taken away the sins of the world amen hallelujah amen the prophet of God had his own and he has many of them there's a man here that can turn on the light amen he could say a greater than Solomon is here oh praise God Amen Lord brother sister and God now that the prophet is of the scene our eyes is not on the prophet he was used of God but we are now in the age when the bride is making the world manifest Hallelujah not by her works not by her wisdom but by his grace unconscious godliness causes that great gift of God in us to flow out of us for the gift of God is eternal life kind of works Paul said not of works not of any things that man can do but God by his grace is manifesting himself through the individual amen yes sir Hallelujah notice Jesus was identified and he was identified by and in them gifts deity it was showing deity manifested for service to die that he might redeem the scripture says that he might save his people from their sin notice in his name will the Gentiles trust Hallelujah notice he did not say save the world from their sins it said save his people God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should have everlasting life you see what you see how they deceived You See How They Carried Away you see their interpretation believing that the whole world is going to be saved as long as the whole world confesses and and feels guilty and so they promulgate that that that that emotion or feeling of guilt to their Prophet they promulgate all those feelings of confession and and stuff like that uh well of course you will come to that but that's when you see the word and the word sees you and you recognize your position and you recognize the great journey of life from birth to the hour that you are in that he was guiding you and protecting you all the time because he wanted to use that gift praise God to identify himself oh blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah oh my praise God forevermore I'm so thankful friends that we are a part of this that's happening amen somebody of course will ask me what's happening and then I say well I know something is happening but I really don't know what's happening but but something is real is happening amen praise God forevermore hallelujah amen you see it was not to save the world but to save his people from their sins and in his name will the Gentiles trust the Gentiles will trust in his name he says amen the Gentiles will trust in his name in other words that bride that's called out of the Gentiles will be trusting only in the name of Jesus Hallelujah because that's where we put our faith is to trust in His Marvelous and wonderful name praise God hallelujah oh praise God see I want you to notice also that them gifts when they came to him they were fitted to that time is that right oh praise God aren't you glad these gifts of this day this hour this time we're living in that those or these gifts have come fitted to this time that we are living in praise the name of the Lord hallelujah don't you know he said that those in that age were identified as gods small duties do you know what that was it was God calling himself gods you you got what what you get that that Jesus was saying those prophets that came before me don't you know they were called gods and if they were called gods and I am the fullness of the word he didn't say that those words in there but I'm saying it now and I'm the fullness of the word oh what should you be calling me in other words I am almighty God Amen and they were small gods you see that was God himself calling himself gods amen oh my praise God what were them ones that were being called Gods what were they they were manifestations of the word there were manifestations of the word praise the Lord hallelujah amen praise God and here was he the fullness of the word embodied deity manifested in flesh Hallelujah now let's watch what he's saying here and understand you see because most people will just pass over this listen what he says here these gifts that those men brought they could not have brought that to a prophet now we know he's not talking about John the Baptist he's not talking about John the Baptist John the Baptist was just a baby and they brought the gifts to the Christ but he is now leaving this inhale that beyond the stand that these gifts of God will recognize their word and they are not going to be magnetized or pulled just to a prophet or the prophet but they will recognize who they are for that gift where the gift let me sit here he says amen see these gifts these men brought they couldn't have brought that to a prophet it would not have been right to bring that bring the gifts in other words bring it to a prophet see that couldn't bring it to Elijah they couldn't bring it to Moses they had to come to him praise the Lord hallelujah praise God oh praise God and being those gifts were strictly meant for that day and was to identify who he was by these gifts then here come God along and protected him and kept them two years until they found the perfect light well we all know not some of us live most of our lifetime uh not knowing what we were searching for going to all kinds of churches maybe even in the message church and you still some hunger in your heart some thirst in there something crying out within you amen because only the word the revealed word could satisfy your your thirst your hunger that is in you only the true genuine bread of life oh praise God forevermore hallelujah amen and do you know it's the same thing today do you believe that we got people just as loyal just nice people genuine people amen and God has always done that to be able to identify the day amen oh my but that means there won't be many just normally he says just a few but he's here he says just a very very few that will be saved the Bible said so that there will just be a handful one handful and Jesus puts it this way as it was in the days of Noah we're in eight Souls were safe listen he says here now he is speaking of eight Souls from an entire generation think of it now back then it might have been millions of people in the world but now it's billions right but nevertheless it will be few there'll be a handful praise the name of the Lord listen as it was in the days of Noah great cultured people great workers great Builders great everything um as made by them civilization see so will it be in the coming of the son of man great civilization great things see amen hallelujah but God had a Noah I'm glad God has no hers of the word to identify the word of this day for the glory of God amen hallelujah amen now these wise men bringing their gifts identified identified what it was that's the reason why God protected them gifts through every move they made Hallelujah from birth till you leave this place you're under the protective care and hand of the almighty God Amen because he wants to use us he wants to use us as his tools for his glory and for his honor Hallelujah you see and he will not stop to protect them because he'll protect them gifts through every move they made he'll protect them until they arrive with them gifts he'll protect you till you go right back into glory amen you identify the word here and you go right back in the glory and he's saying here he's going to protect them until they arrive because that was fitting for that time amen what praise God you understand what he's saying when a gene when a seed when one of these possessing eternal life comes upon the Earth they are fitted suited molded and shaped for that moment that age that they are living in to identify and fulfill the word of God for that day and for the glory of God Amen praise the name of the Lord now if I go on we'll have to spend another half an hour but I'm going to stop here right now and let God receive the glory and let you think on these things let the Holy Spirit go through your spirit and identify the word and revive us encourage us as we move along with God's Mighty and unchanging hand the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ you understand it doesn't mean anybody running to an altar doesn't mean 20 000 people running to an altar but among those twenty thousand people there may be one there may be five I don't know but that's what the uh was being taught to us that's the reason why oral and Billy could give such an altar call you know and and when they go back there isn't anybody or or just a few he says but look when Paul preached that revealed word of God and just a few were called out Paul went there and maybe he left 20 30 or 40 and when he went back then 20 30 or 40 were still standing on the word and some the Bible tells them that they're multiplied also praise God why because one was the gift of God identifying the word for the owl it could do nothing else because that's what it was sent down here for that is the reason and purpose that they are here lives that are prepared and ready for service we are here to serve God and to fulfill not our will but his will his plans his purposes to him be all the glory honor and praise shall we stand to our feet our gracious Heavenly Father how thankful we are for this gift that you have given to every one of us we know that Lord as they your servant has said it's not all the world it's not to all the world but he was sent to the lost sheep of the House of Israel to his or to his people and how the Gentiles in his name they will trust praise God we recognize father that there oh God is going on even right now where Lord you're coming back for your people and we are trusting in you that the word in US will identify the word and at the Deep [Music] will call back to the Deep Like the Wolf in the wilderness which was what brother Branham was trying to speak of or to uh to use as an illustration he says I'm up on the mountain and I hear a wolf howl down in the valley and further up the other way I heard an answering Cry of another wolf out there the male crawling to the female oh praise God what he was trying to show us Lord God I recognize as the Deep cross to the Deep the bride calling to the bridegroom the bridegroom calling back to the bride oh thank you Lord for this great hour of spiritual Revelation and understanding that we might walk in the light as he is in the light until one day we'll walk into the perfect light we give you glory and praise in Jesus name amen God bless you and we are dismissed tonight with God's blessings be upon you we'll see you here on Sunday God willing praise the lord we will come around the word of God to bring his word and rejoice in it may God bless you with a wonderful loaf of bread that can be satisfied your soul God bless you praise the Lord [Music] oh sorry brother [Music] my life I'm a child of the king
