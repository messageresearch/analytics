[2:12] once suffered for our
[2:15] sins the
[2:18] just for the unjust that he might
[2:23] bring us to god being
[2:26] put to death in the flesh
[2:30] but quickened by the spirit
[2:34] by which also
[2:38] he went and preached unto the spirits
[2:43] in prison which
[2:46] sometime were disobedient
[2:51] when once the long-suffering of god
[2:54] waited in the days of noah
[2:58] while the ark was a preparing
[3:02] wherein few that is eight
[3:05] souls were saved by

[4:28] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[4:32] amen
[4:35] thank god friends it was easter time
[4:41] 2 000 years ago in the hills
[4:46] of judea when this
[4:49] great battle took place
[4:55] this battle in
[4:58] that valley and i'm not speaking of
[5:02] death valley in the united states
[5:06] i am not speaking of death valley valley
[5:09] of
[5:10] death in egypt
[5:14] i'm speaking of what david the prophet
[5:17] spoke of when he said
[5:21] yea though i walk through the
[5:24] valley of the shadow of death
[5:29] he was walking through the valley of
[5:33] shadow of death i'm speaking
[5:36] of the battle where
[5:39] jesus christ fought against satan
[5:44] in the pits of hell the
[5:47] valley of death
[5:50] and there was a great
[5:54] battle that was fought
[5:58] that great war started in heaven
[6:02] when the lucifer and his angels
[6:06] fought against michael the great
[6:09] epic battle when he was kicked out from
[6:13] heaven oh
[6:16] the bible records
[6:19] saw satan fall like lightning
[6:23] fall from heaven he was kicked
[6:26] out of heaven down to earth
[6:30] and since then then
[6:33] his entire ambitions
[6:37] is to turn earth
[6:41] into a hell on earth
[6:44] and so this battle was not a short
[6:49] battle
[6:51] it's been a long-standing running
[6:54] war from come down
[6:57] from heaven in the earth through the
[7:00] ages of time
[7:02] right to calvary and then at last our
[7:06] redeemer
[7:07] jesus christ came up on the scene
[7:12] then this battle took place
[7:15] two thousand years ago
[7:18] the battle between jesus christ
[7:21] and satan for the souls of the
[7:26] of man righteous men and
[7:29] women who had given their lives
[7:33] over in faith to god
[7:36] so the price
[7:39] was for the souls of the righteous dead
[7:45] the proponents the the actors
[7:49] the generals words
[7:53] jesus christ versus satan
[7:57] for the souls of those who had believed
[8:01] in him we know this is
[8:05] of course was a historic
[8:08] and epic battle for
[8:12] the patriarchs and the prophets
[8:17] and many other holy men and women
[8:21] who had put their faith in messiah
[8:25] waiting for the coming of the lord
[8:29] and died in faith as the bible says
[8:34] believing unto eternal life
[8:39] believing unto the coming
[8:42] of the lamb of god believing
[8:46] unto their perfect redemption
[8:50] by the blood of that dying bleeding lamb
[8:54] that was to come in their day
[8:58] they look forward in faith
[9:02] with great expectation to the coming of
[9:05] the lord jesus christ
[9:08] that the true lamb not an animal
[9:11] sacrifice but the true lamb
[9:15] not the type or the shadow
[9:18] but the true lamb in reality
[9:22] the lamb of god that taketh away the
[9:25] sins of the world would come and diver
[9:29] for the sins of man and so the bible
[9:32] records
[9:33] these all died in
[9:37] faith you see there we're looking
[9:41] forward to his coming but now
[9:45] in our day we are
[9:49] looking backwards back to calvary
[9:53] back to golgotha's hill back to the shed
[9:57] blood
[9:58] from the cross of jesus christ
[10:01] looking back to the finnish work of god
[10:05] that was accomplished at calvary
[10:10] i'd like to bring your attention
[10:14] to a prominent line found
[10:17] in the apostles creed
[10:22] a part of it which says
[10:25] he descended into hell
[10:29] but then on the third day he
[10:33] rose again thanks be unto our god
[10:37] yes he descended into a hell
[10:42] he descended into death's valley
[10:47] where satan held his
[10:50] prison house we repeat
[10:53] first peter 3 18 20
[10:58] where it says he descended
[11:01] and preached unto the spirits
[11:06] that were in prison now we already
[11:10] now we have with us a clear picture
[11:14] that what had happened is that in this
[11:17] great epic battle
[11:20] it was fought from gethsemane
[11:23] where he swept drops of blood
[11:26] took calvary where the thunder roll the
[11:30] lightning flash the midday
[11:32] sun was blotted out darkness covered the
[11:35] land
[11:36] the earth quaked and shook for the
[11:38] battle was raging
[11:40] and jesus the bible says
[11:45] descended into hell
[11:48] now on the cross they may think well
[11:51] it's over
[11:52] his his spirit his soul left his body
[11:55] and that was the end of it but the bible
[11:58] is telling us
[11:59] the rest of the story
[12:03] he descended into
[12:07] hell he descended
[12:10] into death's valley he descended
[12:14] into satan's prison house
[12:19] now you may find quotations on this
[12:24] israel and the church paragraph 115 to
[12:27] 18 uh paragraph 118
[12:31] expectations paragraph 18 to 22
[12:35] demonology uh 201
[12:38] to the 212 the entw meant
[12:42] uh there you'll find that paragraph 99
[12:46] and the patriarch abraham 1964
[12:50] paragraph 61-62
[12:54] that is just for you if you wanted to
[12:57] go back and study this but we know
[13:02] according to scripture
[13:06] that when jesus left his body
[13:09] hanging on the cross
[13:13] he descended into satan's
[13:17] prison house i believe he was
[13:20] alluding to this when he said how can
[13:24] one go into a strong man's house
[13:28] and take out his goods unless he be
[13:31] stronger than him
[13:34] and now we read the scriptures how he
[13:37] went and preached to the spirits
[13:41] that were in satan's prison house
[13:45] now let me give you some understanding
[13:48] of satan's prison house it's easter time
[13:53] it's time for another prison break
[13:57] a jailbreak time where we'll
[14:00] see how jesus
[14:04] went into satan's prison
[14:08] and took out the prisoners for the glory
[14:11] of god
[14:12] now satan's prison quickly briefly
[14:17] was set up in such a way with
[14:20] two sections
[14:23] one section held the unrighteous
[14:28] dead
[14:30] we may call it while we are here on
[14:32] earth the fifth dimension
[14:36] the regions of the lost
[14:41] hell it is sheol
[14:45] the place where
[14:49] satan has made his headquarters
[14:54] the unjust are there howling
[14:58] demons are there and
[15:02] satan's domain
[15:05] his headquarters is in
[15:08] the pits of hell we read in the book of
[15:11] revelation
[15:12] how apollyon which is another name for
[15:15] satan
[15:15] and how out of the pit came out
[15:18] thousands of
[15:19] demons you see his headquarters
[15:23] are in is in the pit of hell
[15:28] now as i said two sections
[15:31] one section he also the
[15:34] unjust dead spirits of
[15:38] evil men and women
[15:41] holding satan's and his demons
[15:45] and the very place of his headquarters
[15:52] now the next part
[15:55] section two was called
[15:59] paradise also
[16:02] better known as abraham's
[16:06] bosom in it
[16:10] with a righteous dead those who
[16:14] died in faith looking forward
[16:19] to the coming of jesus christ
[16:23] the great messiah
[16:26] certainly my friends now we understand
[16:30] that was only a temporary place
[16:34] and since jesus has died for our sins
[16:39] it has been done away
[16:43] after the shedding of the blood and the
[16:46] freeing of the captives
[16:48] no use paradise
[16:52] as we speak of it is no more
[16:55] but was only a temporary place
[16:59] because jesus emptied it
[17:02] of all the captives that were
[17:06] in it and so we understand that the
[17:09] doctrine
[17:10] of purgatory and the doctrine of
[17:13] praying to saints that are held
[17:17] in paradise or whatever it's
[17:21] unscriptural
[17:22] and it is ungodly
[17:25] it is contrary to the word of god
[17:30] my friends i can see jesus
[17:35] when he went down into hell
[17:39] i can see him when he knocked on
[17:42] hell's door my my
[17:46] god take of it down there
[17:50] he crawled out died
[17:54] at calvary descended
[17:58] into that valley knocked
[18:01] on its door and
[18:05] my friends when he got down there
[18:11] people were wailing many people have
[18:14] dreamt that many people have been caught
[18:17] up
[18:17] into nightmares and they have literally
[18:20] had
[18:21] visions of hell and heard the
[18:24] spirits and souls of lost men
[18:27] and women howling screaming
[18:30] crying with the most of
[18:33] fearsome cries in the midst of it
[18:38] and they were carrying on screaming
[18:42] and jesus must have said
[18:45] you ought to have listened to those
[18:47] prophets
[18:49] why did you not listen to enoch
[18:52] in the time of noah you had
[18:56] enoch you could have listened to him
[18:59] but instead you rejected
[19:02] the word of god you had moses
[19:07] you did not listen to him you turned
[19:10] away
[19:11] from him oh my
[19:14] and so he walked up
[19:19] knocked on that valley's door
[19:23] the door opened and there stood satan
[19:27] with his hooded eyes oh
[19:31] he said so you're here now oh
[19:34] you finally got here i thought
[19:38] i had you when i killed abel
[19:42] i thought i really had you
[19:47] when i killed moses and
[19:50] another time i thought i really got you
[19:53] when i killed you john the baptist
[19:59] i thought i had you for sure but now you
[20:02] have come
[20:03] down here voluntarily into
[20:06] my possession i'm going to
[20:10] hang on to you
[20:13] but i can hear jesus say
[20:16] satan i am the virgin-born
[20:21] son of god hallelujah
[20:24] i come from the ivory palaces above
[20:29] and i come to earth and i'm come
[20:32] down here to death valley because
[20:36] my blood has baited the entire earth
[20:41] for the forgiveness of their
[20:44] sins i paid the
[20:48] entire price
[20:51] i paid the complete price for
[20:55] their redemption and hell
[20:58] so give me those keys and with that he
[21:01] stepped
[21:02] forward and grabbed the keys from off
[21:05] satan the jail housekeeper
[21:08] took away the keys from him hallelujah
[21:12] and said to him i'm taking over now you
[21:16] kept them people here in bondage
[21:19] then one set in section one they're
[21:21] yours
[21:23] but these in section two these
[21:26] righteous dead who live for me and long
[21:30] for me believed the word for me and
[21:33] had confidence in me look forward to my
[21:36] coming now i am here and i have come for
[21:40] them so give me them keys of death and
[21:44] hell and of the grave amen you
[21:47] kept the people in bondage you kept them
[21:49] in fear
[21:51] and everything else but now i take this
[21:54] these keys from you
[21:56] amen and you know he must have just
[21:58] pushed satan aside
[22:00] moved him out out in front of him amen
[22:04] praise god what was it he was the
[22:07] mighty conqueror the mighty
[22:10] conqueror that rent the veil
[22:14] into and now we can look and behold him
[22:18] in plain view thank god that
[22:22] mighty conqueror rolls on easter morning
[22:26] saying i am he that was dead
[22:31] and is alive again
[22:34] and i am alive forevermore
[22:39] and have the keys of death
[22:42] and hell hallelujah and he that
[22:45] heareth my words and believe it
[22:49] in him that set me i
[22:52] raise him up in the last
[22:55] days glory to god hallelujah
[22:59] oh my oh praise god
[23:02] he walked down
[23:05] into hell
[23:08] and there he heard the cries i have said
[23:12] of those in section one on one side
[23:16] but then he went a little lower
[23:20] where satan kept a lot of the saints so
[23:25] they could never escape
[23:29] and while he was walking down the stairs
[23:33] he heard shouting he heard singing
[23:37] it seems like if there was some kind of
[23:40] a jubilee
[23:41] revival meeting going on and
[23:44] shouting going on in a meeting down
[23:47] there
[23:48] and when he turned the corner there was
[23:52] abraham
[23:53] there was sarah there was rebecca
[23:57] there was isaac there was he
[24:01] war jeremiah isaiah oh my ezekiel
[24:06] all the prophets jumping praising god
[24:10] giving god the glory because hallelujah
[24:14] the comforter had come redemption
[24:18] redemption have come the redeemer is
[24:20] here
[24:21] the savior is here the lion and the lamb
[24:25] of the tribe of judah is here oh
[24:28] praise god the wheel in the middle
[24:31] of the wheel is here glory to god
[24:35] hallelujah amen so he knocks on that
[24:39] door
[24:40] and somebody says who's that and
[24:43] abraham opens up the door
[24:46] being the most senior he opens up the
[24:50] door
[24:52] and he says oh my here is the seed
[24:55] my seed the seed of abraham here he is
[24:59] the root and offspring of david
[25:03] oh isaiah said oh
[25:06] he is the great and mighty one
[25:09] hallelujah danielle said he is the stone
[25:13] i saw
[25:14] cut out from the mountain without
[25:17] hands praise god hallelujah
[25:20] amen and jesus said now quiet quiet
[25:24] listen to me
[25:25] you believed in me amen
[25:30] in the times when the goat's blood
[25:33] and heifer's blood could not even
[25:37] take away your sins it only
[25:40] covered your sins but this blood
[25:44] my blood will wash your
[25:47] sins away and completely redeem you
[25:51] and remove your sins far from you
[25:54] from the eastest from the west and put
[25:58] it away
[25:58] forever and ever and now i've come
[26:02] for you to take you out of here it's
[26:05] going home
[26:06] time i'm gonna take you home now
[26:09] oh my listen brother branham speaking he
[26:12] says
[26:12] i can hear abraham say
[26:16] lord can we take a little stop
[26:20] as we go through jerusalem
[26:23] i want to look the old city over i
[26:26] haven't seen it
[26:27] for some time amen
[26:31] and some of the others came also and
[26:34] said lord
[26:34] we want to make a stop uh
[26:38] just see the city amen
[26:41] and i listen prophet speaking
[26:44] i can hear jesus say i've got
[26:48] some things to talk over with my
[26:50] disciples
[26:52] and it will take me about 40 days
[26:57] and so take that time and go
[27:00] and look over the city look around the
[27:02] country
[27:03] amen hallelujah as matthew 27
[27:07] tells us how on easter morning he
[27:11] rose from the grave and the scripture
[27:15] records
[27:17] many of the saints that slept in the
[27:21] dust of the earth rose out of the grave
[27:26] and came out walked in the streets
[27:31] and appeared to many
[27:35] i can see cahifus going to the synagogue
[27:40] holding his eastern garments
[27:43] the robes of the high priest as he walks
[27:47] in the streets
[27:49] and when he looks
[27:52] he sees abraham and sarah
[27:56] as young people walking
[27:59] down the streets looking
[28:02] over the city and
[28:05] somehow they seem familiar
[28:09] to the same those people somewhere
[28:13] i wonder who they are and while he was
[28:16] looking at them and thinking about it
[28:19] that disappeared
[28:20] from his sight just like jesus how jesus
[28:23] went through the wall
[28:25] the same kind of glorified body they
[28:28] had amen or praise god
[28:31] and they were able to appear and
[28:34] disappear
[28:35] with that glorified body amen praise
[28:38] god hallelujah oh glory to god
[28:42] and the bible says he ascended up
[28:45] into heaven and went
[28:48] up together with them read in the book
[28:52] of psalms
[28:53] and you will read where it tells you
[28:56] when the lord approaches the
[28:58] gates of heaven and what they were
[29:00] saying who is this lord of glory
[29:02] and then he answers the lord mighty and
[29:06] battle the lord mighty to save glory to
[29:09] god
[29:10] hallelujah why he had taken out satan's
[29:15] prison house he had created a
[29:18] a jailbreak and the people
[29:21] of all the saints of all the ages
[29:25] that believed upon him trusted in him
[29:28] had an easter time because the lord
[29:31] jesus
[29:32] brought them out with him praise god
[29:35] hallelujah
[29:36] my brothers and sisters listen
[29:40] my dear christian friends demons are
[29:44] working on every hand but god's spirit
[29:48] is also moving on every hand
[29:51] to contract everything that satan does
[29:56] hallelujah do you believe that i believe
[29:59] it
[30:00] amen there you are we see newspapers
[30:04] magazines everything else declaring it
[30:09] and we are watching with spiritual's
[30:12] eyes

[30:16] our day the message for our day the
[30:19] darkness of the hour and the coming
[30:23] of the morning sun lord of god
[30:26] it's the great time we're coming to a
[30:29] showdown amen

[31:09] hip a heavens

[31:14] and he took them out so
[31:17] now he leads those who were in captivity

[41:56] meeting
[41:58] in a church there and
[42:01] that the holy ghost fell and all them
