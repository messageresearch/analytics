please be seated are you happy to be here tonight i believe that our sacrifice is not going to be in vain god sees everything the gas and everything he'll replenish everything what god has done for us what we're doing is nothing to what compared to what he has done you can't pay him back yeah so just a privilege that he has called us to be his students and daughters of god and we have his attributes as sons and daughters of god that see this in us so we thank god for that and without wasting much time today's bible says i'm gonna be reading a lot i'm not good canadian so you gotta just take it like that you're gonna be fine whatever god wants you to hear you hear it amen praise god um our first scripture from matthew 5 verse 11 to 16. okay i think it's on the bottom blessed ie when men when men revile you and persecute you and shall say all man of evil against you falsely for my sake verse 12 rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecutedly the prophets which were before us ye are the salt of the earth but if the sword have lost its savour where will shall it be salted it is handful good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hit neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and you give it light onto all the eye in the house resistant let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven so when they see your good race they will glorify god in heaven so the glory is not for you it's for him and then matthew 7 24 to 27 next stupid therefore whosoever hearing these saints of mine endure them i will liken him onto a wise man which built his house upon a rock that means on revelation of the world um the next race and the rain descended and the flats came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and fell not for it was founded upon a rock upon revelation so no matter what comes against the individual is not gonna push him around and everyone that hears this thing of mine and shall do them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sun that is just intellectual there's no revelation behind that and the rain descended and floods came and the winds blew and beat them that house and fell and grit was a fall of it let's pray oh our gracious eternal god we are so grateful for this evening that we can come to thy throne of grace oh god of abraham isaac and jacob i ask for forgiveness if i've offended be in any way shape or form by thought or indeed ask forgiveness for my brethren oh god that you have that confidence that your blood or god's your blood of christ cleanses from all unbelief so you come to the electron boldly knowing that you hear us if our heart condemns that's not oh great eternal god i pray that you come and feed us give us a fresh word from your presence that at present stage turns out help your children i pray oh god that close my lips from saying anything that you do not want me to say may you help me to get myself out of the way so that you can speak to your children i take every spirit under my control made a great holy ghost heart prominence and bless your children as they hear your voice amen and amen please be seated yeah so i'm going to talk about these two scriptures um first is matthew five from twelve to sixteen and then my two seven twenty four we said that let your light so shine so that um let your light solution be forming that they may see your good race and glorify and glorify your father which is in heaven and paul described the faith of abraham as he when he was given account of abraham he gave that by faith abraham because the faith is what god and peter talk about west both of them are right because um paul talk about what god saw in abraham so the faith that you have will be seen by god and when you put that faith into works other human being said so the fed i was in abraham when it was manifested it produced rest and that's what peter was saying the works of abraham so if you have that seed of god in you and this word has been fully revealed to you and that faith of god in you it will bring forth it's my sorry my topic is what life are you reflecting that's my title what life are you reflecting so if that life of christ is in you and you are part of that chinese um paper that life will project outside effortlessly and people will see it and they will long to be like you amen it's not anything that you are putting up that your life will reflect christ but um unfortunately the christian world or so-called denomination people they have twisted the word of god and they have projected christianity in the eyes of people which is contrary to the word of god not only the letter but revelation everything so when you talk about christianity people have different perception of who a christian has to be but when that word is really revealed to you they will know that there's something different about you you are special among all the people they can't touch your life they'll know there's something about you but they can't explain it and always it's in contrast with the denomination world recently i just met a man i knew that he was a pastor we were just talking in terms oh i didn't tell you i want to do that i'm a pastor and have studied in canada for four years to get my education as if the education is the absolute for the word of god and i was trying to tell that it's good that you have gone to that bible college there's nothing wrong with the bible college to get whatever you have got the paul said that you count all of them as ashes you have to have the revelation of the word of god the education is good for natural substances but not when it comes the word of god it has to be revealed to you without revelation you can never please god amen that's why the whole church word is messed up they're missing the exact ingredient they're right and now bring them to god they don't want to have nothing to do with it so they have intellectualized it and make it education and make it programs and everything but programs is good don't get me wrong but programs should not do it you are the billboards of christ you are the advertisement when people see you they see jesus christ that's why i said what life are you reflecting because they're billboard yes if that billboard normally in this life now the advertisement is just to um what do i say the advertisements to for your senses and what they're advising most of them is just to entice you it's not the right thing the advertisement comes to your eyes and some of them are deceiving a deception but if somebody sell their product like if you have a pure gold you're not going to be scared for somebody to test it because you know it's quality but so if you are a true christian your life reflect christ you are the billboard you are the the main thing that people are about measuring christ by because remember in this time he has no mouth by your mouth he has no hands by your hands what life are you reflecting are you living a different life from the church eyes than what is reflecting on you on the job site is are you living everyday christian life or when you go to school it's a different life and when you come to church a different life the only animal that uh do is that's a camouflage he can just go here and fit here fit your bed a dove or a dove only eat fresh food eagle eater fresh food and a dog also cannot eat on dead substances and is there a crow that could eat the death substance and need the nice one to let a dog eat only the good one you cannot digest it so if you say that you have met god and the life of christ in you that has to automatically reflect effortlessly it doesn't mean that you're not going to make mistakes in your flesh because this place is for the devil has had to do with it so we're not looking at the flesh that god is looking at your desires so don't condemn yourself when you make mistakes he always gonna have that with you but at the same toking if that life is reflecting in you and you have that gold it will speak for itself amen so i'm gonna read this quotation now this is fun from let your light so shine um 6109 all three paragraph 103 he said now the only way that the world will ever see christ is when he they see it in you and me that's the only way they will ever see christ their conscience are numb to their senses to the coal of the beds to the leaves and the grass and the flowers and the music and the message and so forth that we enjoy after we have found christ but until we got to a place that we display christ now remember that each one of you from tonight on tonight remember you are god's bill balls and you are god's advertising agents now the world will look at you to see what christ is so we don't want to smear a block a big lot of stuff on there that testified by things that we really are not first be that then when we be that then the world will see christ in you and in me so it's you and me reflecting christ to the people so when you become a christian you have to watch our work very well because sometimes your attitude your the way your character sometimes that will show outside it can push some people away from the gospel or it can bring people to christ so you have to do your part saving was god's advertising agent he advertised the billboard he didn't do any miracles but his life testified of jesus christ so that he was even willing to give his life when the time came for them to kill him he said you uncircumcised you speak like you say you're circumcised in the heart you have killed the prophets and the people were so mad but you know what out of about five thousand people that killed seven only one that led to god death on the side paul and he became he was the apostle that did the rest so once you live in the life of christ you don't know whom your life will touch whom will come to christ down the road so your every step every action that's why i put christ always before my face but you cannot do all that without having that seed of god because when that part of chinese is in you it reflect by itself effortlessly it's not you trying to be a christian it's not you meditating how to live that life will project itself automatically and if it's in you then it will be abraham says somebody if you say you got it and your life doesn't reflect it go back and check your relation something might have been wrong somewhere amen so we have the life of christiness we are the god advertising billboard so we have to watch our work we want to watch our life because all we are living in the end time and we as god's children our life has to be testing because when it talks about advertising if someone advertise something maybe a drink or a car and at that very moment i'm looking for a car it won't attract me if i'm hungry and i see people of advertising that is going to attract me but if somebody is advertising a car i don't care about it so when you live that life of christ and someone that have a seed of god in him who is thirsting after righteousness will long to be like you because your life is reflecting christ something that he lacked i was told i was talking to this mother when i was not a christian there were certain things that i said oh man i wish i'm a christian but this thing no way i cannot live this life but i told him when god called me it was the easiest thing for me to do why because it wasn't me something has taken place inside of me when something takes place inside of you it's no more you amen the things i used to do i do them no more no one that is adjusting they ask you for um caribana that taste is gone because you have become a new creature amen the old sister johnson is no more there he's dead he's crucified amen he died daily but when he came to the lord jesus christ the old person dead so when the devil tries to knock there's no entry for him anymore amen that place is full of jesus amen we're not going back amen we're going forward we're marking towards the high color of christ believing those things that are behind all the drugs every reliever will be walking across the high colon of christ that's the sage that we are living now amen all those things doesn't attract us anymore it has no pull on the son or daughter of god the taste of what has lost his hold on you it has no pull on you anymore because there is something else pulling you the true gene of christ the true seed the attribute of christ that is the new is pushing forward and pushing all those negative things away amen and is pushing they want to come out fully and display the quality of christ so that the world will testify that this people has been with jesus amen that's the emphasize the emphasize is not how much you can read it's not how much you can do miracle how much you can use the latin and everything and how beautiful your your room your churches or how wealth or this that you have they emphasize that what's in the bible is it the people saw that they have been withdrawn jesus christ because that life will project through you amen and some one time peter you wanted to deny christ but he said that your speech even deny you amen praise god so if you're a son or daughter of god you cannot help it but to reflect the lord jesus christ amen even when you're a child before i become a christian certain things that you do people like myself i was just thinking about it as a young woman you finish high school you go to a place like drinking bar to drink and smoke and then some people come say you bob natus they call me bob you are not a smoker you are not a drinker they come and point you just the way you even hold it doesn't mean that you are you you are good at it unconscious they're always telling me because i was trying to fit in but you consider you an oddball but something has what you're gonna see yourself that you're out but certain things you don't fit into that you are a stranger and pilgrim in this world amen we are not from here so our actions doesn't reflect earthly people our actions reflect the heavenly jesus that's why we are reflecting amen hallelujah praise god i as the sun reflect the silence we reflect the sound of god amen that's our reflection amen we have no choice hidden in our god is good all the time praise god hallelujah so just imagine brother paul brother peter and john when they came from about three days from pentecost and they saw this man who was crippled from 40 years but abraham explained that that man was asking money maybe to buy clutches so all that he was asking he was doing that to say can get banished you can walk by clutch or something so when peter and john told him that silver and gold had violent he said that the man was disappointed but behind the eye sparkling eye of an old pirate and a young john he saw something different about them so is you and me people sometimes can't figure you out they see something about you something special something that they cannot describe and they long to have that so the man long to have what peter and john had so no one already said that in the name of jesus rise up and take up your crotches but i'm saying he believed that amen and he just got up and began to walk walk oh when they said that in the name of jesus sign up all the bulls everything begin to work open amen all those clutches begin to untie and he just walked but when the people recognized they said that in chapter four they said that the pharisees and the rest they recognized that john and peter were ignorant and unlearning but they realized that they have been without jesus so the emphasize that we have being with jesus they went to the upper room and their life was not the same and the same god that was in them god has not died amen he hasn't changed god that was worth and the abraham the same god abraham died and god was in jacob isaac all of them god that was in abraham the prophet died but that god is not dead that god is in you and me today he's the president thanks god he's the one riding the trail through the bride he took his prophet he took his sins but he never died he's in you and me those attributes those sons of god those seed that are ready those that are hazed they have nowhere to go but to obey this way because you are part of him where can we go no wonder peter said where can we go thou alone has or eternal life the rest came there for what fish bread for money popularity yes but there was something that peter was looking beyond he wasn't looking after all the gifts or anything he won the giver of the gate he saw that thou alone has an eternal life and nothing in this world can entice us again after receiving this true word of god you and i know that nothing compares to this that we have not just the letter but the revelation part of it the written part something that speaks your heart nothing come close to what we have so is this popularity or fame or money what can separate us from the love of god nothing amen we are our back is like the door is closed we're chatting with god amen chatting with god amen hallelujah shouting with god in the secret place there in the spirit beholding his face true to strange in this race i know to be shouting with god we are shouting with god amen nothing in this world can separate us from the love of god amen so what i'm trying to say is that this christian life is simple they have made it so much to the outside world make it so complicated but god through his his grace through our pastor has let us know this is so simple just open your heart and let god come in and live his life through you that's simple as that he said that he that had what ceased from his own race has entered into what his rest so it's no more your worst is god living his life through you and when he's living his life through you it doesn't mean that every one of us will be doing science and wonders miracles healing the healing the sick raising the dead which reminds you because it follows us we don't fight for it is that right but abraham was saying saying over here is that um what yeah he said that what are we to do today no matter we don't have to have big audience we don't have to preach to ten thousand we don't have to even preach we can be god's advertisement board how do you know that your life might not start some young man on the gospel some of you older men see old women start some young man on the floor out there will you win 10 000 souls to christ is because that he saw christ in you you that presented christ to him in the simple power of the gospel you may never see a vision you may never put your hands on a sick person and feel the charge of almighty god make a skeleton of mind turn back to life again you may never see him standing beyond that in three or four rainbows you may never see his image you may never hear his voice but still you can be a signboard that will reflect jesus christ by a life that has being so pure and unadulterated from the world not cluttered up with dirty things around your life but a pure thing that it causes a hungry heart to hunger and test to be like you amen what he's trying to say is that you may not do big miracles which it has to follow their believers you are not what tied us down when god needs to use you for a miracle he will use it he wants to use you for everything he will use it but what he strives even if you don't see that in your life you can still live a clean christian life and that people long and thanks to be like you you can witness the people that people inside your life speak more louder in heaven than your worst is a life behind the name that the demon fear and tremble the life of christ in you that's what the demons fear and tremble so he might not do all those big things but if christ is reflecting in you it will bring one soul like they said uh moody or whoever it was don't say an old lady that witnessed to hear him and that lady when she did that she didn't know that god was going to use that dwight moody to bring millions to him so the life that you lead that's what thundered that's what the demon fear and tremble and that life is the life of christ is zoey so you that are you are caused god's children you have that life it's not something that you're gonna make it up but if that seed of god in you it will reflect itself but sometimes too there's a path that you have to do if you know that you're a son or daughter of god and you don't straighten up your life you might also lose the joy of your salvation that's why the vision that restored unto me the joy of work thy salvation there are certain things our decisions bringing stress there are certain trials that god we ourself bring those things to ourselves so when you're going through everything you have to set your your heart face and see why am i going through this is it something that i have done is it my choices or is it god try me because he promised he will not give you anything that you cannot also obey everywhere is going to make a way for you so you are victorious in christ jesus you don't have to worry about anything amen all is well all is well all is well amen hallelujah all is well just relax and let god have its own ring you don't have to worry with god always will and all things are possible to them that believe amen because faith looks beyond what you can feel because from i since we are young we've been thought to go by our feelings we've been taught to go by what we're hearing we've been taught to go by what we see where god's word faith looks beyond that he only looks the word of god and as i said that my word shall not come out void unless it accomplished what it was sent for amen so this one will come to pass no matter what it will come to pass it will be fulfilled nothing can hinder that he said let every man's word be alive that might be the truth amen he's the same yesterday today and forever god hasn't changed amen hallelujah praise our god hallelujah amen and amen praise god hallelujah so i'm going to go back to that my 2 7 24 to 26. i'll read it again no man therefore whosoever hear this saying of mine and the way them are lacking unto him are lacking him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock that rock as i said it was revelation amen so when you build your house on a rock if you read the next verse it says that the nexus and then rain descended and the flash came and the wind blew and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock no under job no matter what he went through his soul his mind everything he had that revelation of god in him so because god was inside of a part of him no matter what he went through he couldn't what distracts him from self god's when the trials come when he lost his wife you lost everything you have that unconscious horse inside of him he couldn't deny his maker even unto death he told his wife that the lord take it and the lord give it blessed be the name of the lord amen why because his house was built on solid rock not on sand the only thing as we head into us towards the end of this world the only thing that will keep you if your house is built on solid rock on revelation of the word of god brabram says somewhere that all other people all everybody all those people that say they are christians they are going to be just a mimic impersonation of christianity unless those that have whose name were written in the lamb's book of life before the foundations of this world all the rest are being personated of christianity amen if your name is in that book if you are part of god's attributes nothing can shake you the trust will come the sign they said some of the roots when it gets the wind comes the root goes down more down amen so if that house is built on solid rock on the pure revelation of god's word nothing can move i believe in the same faith the same thing that apostles had the same thing that the hebrew children they have faith in god they didn't care they have revelation of god's word and they said that we know have confidence that their god is able to deliver them but even if you chose not to they are not going to bow down to what that idol amen so is a true christian so is that man a son or daughter of god that have the attribute of god in him or in hell no matter what you are going through you are going through jesus no matter what may fall may come to your way your life is in his hands he will see you true don't look at the circumstances just grounded more in the word of god asking for more wisdom if you like it more understanding more revelation on that solid rock it will pass the test amen i believe that daniel had it that's why when they put him to the lion's den even in death he won't deny the word of god amen the lions god sent an angels to come and what protect him amen so that same god daniel god is alive he hasn't dead he hasn't died he's a living god he will never die he said the lord never dies no slumber amen he said living god what we have is a real thing amen somewhere he was saying that if i'm hungry i need food i cannot be worn by painted wood painted fire you when you are coding a rail fire to warm you up you need the holy ghost which is part of you if you fight if you have it when that reinforced it will bring you to more life because every sins shall bring forth the first time you manifest whatever i see inside of you you can't avoid that so brother paul also have the same thing he met god for himself he said that i did not come to you with enticing waste with men's words of wisdom i came in the power and demonstration of the holy ghost he threw everything that he learned away and only god led by the revelation of the word of god and that revelation was so much that even peter was saying that the abundance of revelation is too much in rapport and with that revelation when the time came you can say that great where is your victory then at in 1st corinthians chapter 2 he said that first corinthians 2 no sorry or in first corinthians chapter two he said that my under speech and my preaching was not with enticing waste of mind's wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power of the holy ghost amen that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god amen praise our god hallelujah thank you jesus amen praise god hallelujah yes and in first corinthians chapter 15 verse 55 he said oh death where is thy stink oh great where is your victory the stink of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god please give us a victory through what our lord jesus christ amen so brother paul has that faith in god that he wasn't even scared of death so is us a time is coming and it's around the corner if that's that much i was saying those people believe us in cameroon what are they going through is death on their true ukraine they're facing it we're not gonna have it a flurry bed of ease there's going to be a time and even it is since i was wrapping up and the only thing that i would stand is the attribute of god the revelation that sin that will not shake because to shake everything apart from those whose name were written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and you have the revelation of it you know what god has done in your life you know how it came to you you know how this world has kept you something keep on quote keeping me something has kept you all this far many are shaking even they're covered that came you shake a lot of people up but you are so standing why are you standing something in you is god himself keeping you he's keeping his attribute he's keeping the part of himself amen no matter what comes your way our life is the hands of jesus christ amen nothing can shake us help me no persecution what shall separate us from the love of god in christ no matter what the enemy does it will not stand god is on our path amen our god is awesome hallelujah praise god amen okay i'm gonna read john 15 16 2. i just wanted to read a lot today sorry for john 15 16. [Music] yes sunday i just came to office and it was just right on my eye i couldn't take my eyes off on the understanding of this i said the bible said sorry ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordain you that you should go and bring forth fruits and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may not give it to you so that god has chosen you and also has not ordained you not only their ministry has obtained your part of life whatever that god has ordained for you to pass through nothing can hinder that i wanted to bring a picture that i saw somebody's post on the facebook in africa there was um at this big block like that and there was a little tree that was growing inside and the tree has best up through the truck and has grown very tall and those blocks was around that tree whatever that the enemy threw up on you what god has ordained for you to do nothing when the time comes you're gonna spring forth amen night those comes the night the light is coming light is coming amen night and job remember light is carrying amen hallelujah god is in control amen so i think i'll bring it to end by reading first corinthians chatting verse 2 verse 4 to 9 i'm not going to read or just he said that i had not seen and ye had not also heard what god has in store for those that love him and you love god so there are things that god has reserved for you so i want you to live here happy with your head high knowing that god has something resolved for you i have not seen and yet i've not heard what god has in store for you that means jesus can come amen amen so whilst living here think of that that living nothing not even death can separate us from the love of god amen and yeah god has something better in store for you amen that's what i have for tonight so we just think on this and reflect christ wherever you go let the people see you then they see jesus christ amen [Applause] let's sing um i'm going through oh i'm going through yes i'm going through i'll pay the price [Music] i'm going through lord i have started to walk little shining upon me from heaven [Music] is [Music] [Music] whatever others do i'll [Music] oh there are many [Music] others accept it because [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] out with jesus and i'm going through i'd rather walk with jesus [Music] [Music] [Music] whatever others do [Music] oh brother [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Music] pay the price whatever others do i'll take away i've started out jesus [Music] i'll pay the price [Music] i've started out with jesus [Music] while you are dismissed tonight [Music] there's been a great change [Music] there's been a great change since i was born there's been a great change since i was born that's been a great change since i was born has been a great change since i was born the things i used to do i do them no more the things i used to say i say them no more the places i used to go i go [Applause] [Music] since i was born there's been a great change since i [Music] a was change since i was born there's been a great change since i was born it's been a great change since i was born the things i used to do i do that no more the things i used to say i say that no more [Music] since i was born there's been a great change since i was born there's been a great change since i was born there's been a great change since i was born there's been a great change since i was born [Applause] you are dismissed tonight have a good night may god
