Sharon Josh arouse and their children represented here today in the house of the Lord and we're happy for them several of you may know them and others don't know them could you just briefly stand up

good glad to have all of you here and I trust you'll be really and truly blessed by the word of God that comes through our brother today amen are you prepared for to receive the word Hallelujah remember we are here in the voice of God in these last days amen praise the Lord and preparing for our flight I don't know about you but I'm preparing for a flight almighty praise God we're living in gracious times we see the chaos all around us we see all the nations God moving them into position for what plans he has ahead uh you know you're seeing the different um let's say social and ideological things in the world changing fast socialism fascism capitalism and God you know the prophet said none of them will work they all have to pass because there's only one king and that's the king of Peace amen Hallelujah he said they all claiming that they're gonna bring peace but there's no peace until the Prince of Peace comes himself and he will bring peace and we thank God that we already recognize that so we are serving that King we are under his preeminence and jurisdiction and we pray that the holy spirit will lead and guide every one of us as we walk day by day in this perfect light of the hour that's shining Upon Us Praise the Lord may God bless you as you open your hearts to receive God's word we welcome these brothers praise God brother Tom [Music] come greet the Saints and Josh I don't know if you can sing but [Music] praise the Lord praise the Lord Saints I don't have much to say I'm kind of like my daughter a little nervous in front of people you see all these eyes staring at you thank God they're not raccoon eyes the rise of Grace and Eyes Of Love and every time we come back it just it warms our heart to see where we were birthed and what Ministry we've been a part of and we still are a part of no matter where we go we take uh the Revelation and the understanding of the word and the growth that Christ has given us to everywhere we go and we just try to be a blessing and I think that's what each and every one of us to do you know to do is just to allow him to live through us allow him to be expressed to this Dying World because they need to see something different they need to see life they need to see hope they need to find peace and that's only in Christ so I don't want to take any more time because I'm a man of few words but it's wonderful to see it keep pressing on just relax just relax and let the word live right A lot of times women cannot get pregnant because they're so nervous and worried about it you know and they end up relaxing and forget about it and they bring forth a child they're able to conceive right so stress in all these things we fret about just hinders the word from moving through us just let the word of God have his way in your life God bless your Saints it's a blessing to see you and thank you for you know still opening the door and allowing us to come here God bless you okay our sisters are here uh they're sister Sharon Ivan uh God bless her real good those of you who know her or we greet her and God bless you real good and uh Mr Ruth amen who grew up in this church from Tiny now she has a beautiful family praise the name of the Lord amen and we have her husband Josh is here and this is just a beautiful thing as I was thinking about it how uh you know both Quebec and Canada is

year it's so uh busy but we'll be there praise the name of the Lord and God bless every one of you now as we prepare our hearts to receive the word of God let us all stand look to the Lord in prayer as the man of God comes to bring the word of God grow praise the name of the Lord hallelujah he is Lord [Music] he is Lord he has risen from the dead he is risen from the dead and he is Lord every knee shall bow oh thank you Lord every time [Music] that she Jesus Christ his Lord Now sing it my lord is my Lord God bless our brother Tim as he comes [Music] instructions [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen praise God thank the Lord for his Wonderful Grace this morning thanks Pastor Simon for doing all the introductions for me and welcoming all the visitors and our precious brother sister and her family so I can get right into the word amen hallelujah that's what you come for is to hear the word amen and may the spirit of God speak to your hearts today God just turned me in a different direction for some reason last night so um we've been talking on the third pull and the Mysteries and the Thunders and that but we're just gonna talk about moving forward this morning amen moving forward in the grace of God hallelujah I don't know I got uh some uh notes here and that stuff but uh see there's there's preparing a message is by the written word and then the unwritten word I I have nothing to do with that I I'm just standing here by faith this morning uh being a vessel to God and see what he would do it amen we have to be uh participators this morning enough spectators right if you want to be uh spectator then let the deacons lead you out there's no sense you being here but if you want to be a participator in the word of God because you know you you have faith you pull I preach amen hallelujah you believe he comes and he fulfills that's the way it works amen this is a spiritual church it's not a carnal church it's a spiritual church amen we're in the presence of somebody mighty Hallelujah Mighty and great this morning let us turn to Philippians 3 10. and then we're going to go to uh Second Corinthians 5 17. short scriptures and Isaiah 43 18. Philippians 3 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made comfortable unto his death if by any means I might attend unto the resurrection of the Dead not as though I have already obtained either were already already perfect but I follow after that which I may apprehend that for which I also am apprehended of Jesus Christ of Christ Jesus Brethren I count it not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen let's go to Second Corinthians 5 17. amen therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold All Things become new Isaiah 43 18. remember ye not the former things neither considered a things of old behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it question mark I will even make a way in the wilderness and the rivers in the desert let us pray father we thank you for your love grace and mercy father we surrender ourselves into your hands the great hands of the Holy Ghost this morning Lord as we gather together father your people Lord may you come in our midst or else it'd just be a church service Lord come Lord and feed your people this morning speak to your people's hearts and move us forward in the perfect faith that you have given us in this hour father Grant these things Lord we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated God bless you Hallelujah the third Paul moves us forward into the reality amen Hallelujah but this one thing Paul says forget in those things are which are behind and reaching for those things which are ahead we got a lot to reach for my brothers and sisters oh my God just given us a word in this hour such a mighty word in this hour hallelujah it's just full amen their Storehouse is just full of food there's no reason why we should be starving Hallelujah we got so much food stored up amen and the Holy Ghost is here just waiting to unveil it to you open those seals to you open those mysteries of who you are to you in this hour and in this day amen we are new creatures in Christ all things have become all things have become new with us amen and we don't look to the old things Paul's saying here that uh when he's talking about apprehended he's saying listen just like he says I'm not what I used to be but amen but I'm not what I want to be but I'm not what I used to be he's talking about a walk a progression of faith in his walk in his maturity amen he's saying listen I'm not there yet hallelujah we're not there yet Saints but I'm moving towards that place amen I'm looking to Christ Jesus the word I'm looking to the faith that has been delivered to the Saints in this hour by a spoken word prophet and I'm looking to that and and I'm moving towards that amen Oh Glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus amen thank you Lord hallelujah now another uh thing here I don't want to get ahead of myself you know you know me I just try to get ahead of myself sometimes and here in Philippians in The New International Version it says all this I have already arrived at my goal but I pressed on to take hold of that which which Christ Jesus Took a hold for me brothers and sisters I do not consider myself yet a taken hold of it yet but one thing I do forgetting those things amen what is behind me and I'm straining towards what's ahead of me I press towards the goal amen the mark the goal the word in this hour amen hallelujah to win the prize for God has called me this walk he has called me in this direction amen glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord amen perseverance it means to be persistent to make a goal to be persistent you have you have got your mind rain set on something and you're persistent about it and because of it you believe it the thing that you want you are believing that you are going to get it and that's what Jesus meant when he says when you say to this mountain be removed amen and don't doubt in your heart that means you already know you're going to get it you already see it in your future you already seen it come to the manifestation in your life and that's what you're moving towards listen without a vision the people perish Hallelujah without a vision of this word a revelation of this word where are you going you're coming to a message Church you you're brought up in the message you stay under the message church but where are you going there's got to be a vision there's got to be a purpose there's got to be a revelation revealed to you there's a life a manifested life a token that is here that God wants to put on display and that's what we're moving forward to we're not looking to the world it's gross Darkness out there you talk about being totally blacked out oh my there's no hope out there there's no future out there Hallelujah not to the Bride of Jesus Christ she's not holding on to anything that's out there then why are we slacking why are we lazy why ain't we pressing in why ain't we determined and straining for this Revelation to become one with us why ain't we moving forward don't look at brother Tim beers God put something on The Minister's heart he knows what he's saying my mind my heart is always blank by the grace of God amen I come up here just to speak what he wants me to speak Hallelujah yes then be persevered when you are perseverant when you get that word hold on to it hold on to the promise because that promise is yours Hallelujah amen just like Jacob Jacob knew amen he wanted that Birthright and Jesus said you must be born again to enter into the kingdom of God Jacob wanted that Birthright so much that he wrestled with the angel and he said I'm not letting you go until I know that I'm blessed amen till I know amen that I know that I know amen that I got what you promised to me and that's the way we should be in this hour Hallelujah not question am I Born Again no you should be questioned whether you're born you should know that you're born again you should know that you're in the kingdom of God and this hour is too late in this hour and if you don't know it's time Amen to get on your knees and start praying in this hour Hallelujah moving forward with God means walking in faith and not fear when God calls us to move forward or asks us to make some changes fear will cause us to stay where we're at and not move forward with God sometimes we fear what people think or perhaps we fear whether we heard God correctly or not that is the greatest thing that holds people back fear from stepping out and moving forward when especially when God speaks to you we look at all the circumstances around it we look at our lives we look at whether whether uh we're worthy or we're we have the ability we look at all kinds of reasoning all kinds of excuses not to move forward not to press on and one of them is fear false evidence appear in real safe in this tool but it's a powerless tool and that's what we need to recognize it has no power in it glory to God moving forward also requires us of letting go let him go and letting God have his way that just sounds like a word amen but letting go of our our lives and letting go of our thoughts and letting go of everything around us that God has caused it's not easy sometimes it's not easy to press forward and let go of things but we gotta press in my brothers God has given us the tools he's given us the anointing to break the yoke oh my many different things letting go places people fears letting go of the ways we do things the way we think acts speak all kinds of things it's not easy my brothers and sisters to die Paul says I Die daily but it's not easy to die I don't care if anybody says here oh I came to the Lord it was so easy let go of everything to die out to everything I question that person amen I'd watch what that person is saying because it's not easy we got the glory of God Amen in the seed of God who does not sin we got the attribute of God but we're walking through a dimension to bring that attribute into manifestation but there's a flesh amen there's a there's a dimension here that we have to fight that are filled with demons demon powers amen that we got to press through and we gotta fight and we gotta move forward in this hour glory to God amen every time you want to overcome something every time you want God reveals something to your heart amen you know you got to let it go remember behind that unbelief there's a demon there and that demon will fight you right to the end but you've got to have faith and take the word that God spoke into your heart and move forward you keep saying boo to that devil he'll get smaller he'll get smaller just don't stop keep going Hallelujah amen moving forward with God means walking towards our Divine Purpose the closer we get to our breakthrough to our Divine Purpose the more the enemy will try to distract us he will attempt to send naysayers negative people to convince that we should turn back but we must hold on to the fact that God has our future planned and if we let go of the past you see the past is a place we can learn from but we should never live in the past we've got to live in the present in the moment I'm not the same person I was last week that I am today and either are you the manner you had last week is no good today you need something by the spirit of God in your soul today because this is a progression of Faith a progression of Revelation that God is doing God's truth is marching on amen it's marching on the Rapture is on the event is coming Hallelujah Satan the enemy's trying to like the scripture says lukewarm laziness locked where where right here right here is where he's at the closest to the word the closest to the truth that's where he's always been right from the Garden of Eden it is not going to go out there you think he's going to focus his time and his energy on making them lukewarm powerless lazy no right here because there's a power here that can overcome him there's a life here that if that life gets in the flesh that life gets awakened in us all his kingdom will be shaken and Shook and defeated glory to God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus I preach you Paul and you pray amen glory to God brother Brown is speaking here in the seventh seal remember Satan will try to impersonate he'll try to impersonate everything that the church will do and we noticed it through down through the Antichrist but this one thing he cannot impersonate there's no mimics to this see because he don't know it there's no way for him to know it are we listening I know I read this I'm going to keep reading it until you get it it's the third pull he just knows nothing about it you see he doesn't understand it nobody can explain it it can't be touched with man's hands nobody can interfere with it in your life your personal walk Satan has no clue of what's going on inside of you unless we open our mouths and then all he can do he still doesn't understand it but all he can do is try to bring distractions because he sees you moving your mouth moving in a certain direction and he wants to go and put distractions hindrance in your way that's why the Apostle Were Meant a few words they only spoke when they needed to speak Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord Satan is working hard to distract us deceive us and hinder us from seeing the truth that's why he fights us so we must not let Satan interpret the word to us personally to our walks and our lives because he knows nothing about this Revelation like we said before he's a liar you wouldn't listen to a liar and everything that comes out of his mouth is lies so why let him speak to you when he knows nothing about this I'm not going to go to somebody for uh for an issue or for a topic that knows nothing about this and this person knows everything about it I'm going to go to this person and I'm going to ask him not to I'm not going to listen to this person I see this resume it's defeated he lost he knows nothing about it he's a liar he's a cheat he's a destroyer but I'm going to go to where life is somebody who understands somebody who understands me inside only he can understand me that deep calling to the Deep God understands God amen thank you Lord the devil the devil is nothing but a snake he has no arms and he has no feet so what is the interpretation of that he's been disarmed and defeated [Applause] rejoice amen Hallelujah yes that's right that's who that's you know that's why Brother Brad said when you get there you're going to realize that little guy cause all this trouble in my life but you see the progression of faith the progression of moving on with the word that the progression of maturity in The Bride of Jesus Christ is coming to a place where she knows who she is she knows what she stands for there's a confidence a certainty about her amen that she knows all these things she recognizes her greatest enemies herself oh my so my brothers and sisters stop worrying trust in the Lord stop worrying oh don't act like nobody worries in here on speaking to a people that maybe I'm speaking Angels here nobody worries right yeah Hallelujah Jesus said don't worry about tomorrow oh how many times do we miss the moment how many times do we miss what God is doing now maybe even some of you thinking about tomorrow thinking about later on later on don't exist you might not make it outside these doors that don't exist what exists right now right now exists we shouldn't be worried about anything else but now and when we when we where we live in the now then God speaks to us now we want God now we want God now but we live in the future we live tomorrow next week no no that's not the way we walk as Sons and Daughters of God they're led by the spirit of the Living God Amen every moment thank you Lord stop being led by your feelings well what an age of feelings I feel this I feel I'm this I'm feeling that you hurt my feelings you offended me oh my God you know what truth don't care about your feelings yes yes feelings are great indicators they're great motivators but they are bad leaders oh my I guess that's why the Lord amen hope there's no feminists in here this morning or that Spirit but I guess that's why the Lord said right back in the Book of Genesis amen that the woman keeps silent because why the man did not fall the women fell and that's why today women are not leaders Hallelujah and men are not dominators either okay it goes both ways men love their their women like Christ loved the church and gave his life but women don't dominate over the man and lead the men because they're emotional creatures no man of God is led by a woman I'll tell you that right now we can get inspired right but not LED there's a different story glory to God amen moving forward with God means walking into our Divine Purpose which God determined even before the foundation of the world before we even born Jeremiah 1 5 as we progressed the enemy will attempt to pursue us and change that us that change is impossible the enemy wants to convince us that our best days are gone but God has a track record of giving new life even when it seems to be too late just as he did with Abraham you're never too old amen God can speak and change that from The Young to the old so we should never ever think in our lives well we're getting up in age you know I'm I'm up in age you know and you know what for men Auntie Paws I guess they call it and they're for women menopause they call it all kinds of excuses come in in that period of time yes there's a chemical change in your body yes there's things going on but let me tell you one thing if I can't get it right now I'm reaching for that change for that word for that Faith Amen to overcome whatever's needed so I don't make excuses for the devil and this flesh yeah I know what's going through your mind yeah but that's that's fine listen either we believe God's word or nothing you don't have to agree with me you don't have to even like my style of preaching amen but the word of God it's the truth especially if the spirit of God is speaking to you you want to walk out these doors different you want to walk out of the tent of the Holy Ghost this morning different change then believe God's word believe for the impossible like Abraham and Sarah did passage looked impossible but they believed God's word and he said my promise he said Abraham said God your promises are true if all things fail your promises can't fail and that's the way we got to be with the word of God today oh my God hallelujah it means that you are willing to continue even during difficult times it also implies that you are fighting until obstacles no matter how huge they are are overcome but moving forward also means that you do not allow external circumstances to stop you from pursuing the mark pursuing that that Faith from manifesting in your life no matter what my brothers and sisters what God has spoken what God has revealed it shall come to pass in your life he will perform it in your life we didn't get a promise from Men the word comes to a prophet the prophet speaks it amen but what what do we hear that still a small voice was not the prophet's voice it was the Lord Jesus Christ's voice he's the one that's building faith in us the book of Hebrews 12 1 wherefore seeing we are also compass with a about with such a great cloud of witnesses oh my I was thinking about that the great cloud of witnesses that are here just think of what he said in the scriptures here we are Compass we are uh entertained we are accompanied accompanied with with with such a great cloud of witnesses that have gone before us and then he says lay aside every weight because they're here they're watching amen they're looking on they're they're they're they're speaking Press On press forward move on my brothers and sisters those who have gone before us they're here this morning keep pressing the bottle keep moving on you're almost there you're almost there personally in your walk that battle that you're going through nothing you need to overcome you're almost there it's almost over whoa my Glory Lori thank you Lord lay aside every week that so easily besets us and run not walk run with patient the race that sets before us looking unto Jesus not looking to anything else now look into our circumstances our flesh the devil the world looking unto Jesus the author and finisher the beginner the Ender of our faith oh my glory to God I was thinking about that and how many times I've had experiences don't don't don't don't ask me to I just don't understand but I was texting with sister Marsha and we were texting back and forth and she mentioned Daniel in the text and when she when I read that text I can't explain it but he was there in my heart I almost started weeping amen and I said sister when you said that and she goes yes brother because it's the bond of love the Eternal Bond of love and I thought about that and I said and I got to that scripture there's a cloud of witnesses oh my they're closer than you think this is closer than you think we're nearer than the end and you think my brothers and sisters and God is urging us to press on Glory almost home amen almost home brother Simon amen Hebrews 4 says there's a rest for the Saints the rest is knowing who you are the greatest battle that Satan fights us is knowing who we are because when we recognize who we are the rest comes that's where the perfect rest is that's the rest for the believer when you know that you know who you are Satan can't play around with you if he does you take that word of God and you chop your way through every enemy that comes in your way get out of my way Satan glory to God oh Hallelujah yes we thirst for that profession and we may never get it in this flesh but in our souls there's a rest because we know who we are the people of this world is in chaos confusion and perversion is everywhere in the flesh because they don't know who they are and Satan has got them to go insane which means in sin unbelief in their minds nobody knows who they are in this day and age except the people that have been chosen predestinated by the word of God to know who they are they are the ones that are moving forward into the Rapture they are the ones that are moving forward in perfect Faith they are their Overcomers in this age no other Overcomers my brothers and sisters you know they can get some victory out there let me make something clear they can get some victory out there faith is Faith right amen but they ain't getting this faith this victory they ain't going in a Rapture my brothers sisters why because brother Tim said so I'm being critical no how can they go into a Rapture when the Rapture faith is here and they don't got it how can you be healed if the doctor gives you the medicine and you don't take it you need to take it so stop feeding off of that out there God has given you a word this is the bride's food this is your food that will nourish you strengthen you what you need to overcome in your life every one of us are different every circumstance is different every flesh is different but God has given us all the tools he knew everything that we would have need of and he put it right here Hallelujah people say oh you know the message is not finished so they can complete this everything is completed you know why I don't look to the written word I look to the unwritten word I look at that written word it takes me places that's not written down there it takes me into areas shows me things to come shows me all kinds of things about my life and then I sit there and I go just like even preparing a preacher preparing for a message when you're prepared sometimes God shows you so many things I'm going in my head I'm going how how how am I going to bring this he goes you can't bring it I have to bring it oh my that's why I'm excited amen you might not be getting excited what you if you're like if you're being want to be tickled by by just good preaching or good public speaker amen that you might not see nothing but if you see the excitement that I have inside with the word and what he's doing and what he's speaking if you catch the same spirit and get behind the Same Spirit then you start opening it up to the Revelation the thought of God behind this that's what you start breaking into amen sometimes when we stop and think about what we have experienced the trials in our lives and and how we we cannot get stuck or we can get stuck in disappointments unforgiveness bitterness offense fear guilt anxiety insecurities indifference or lack of Interest or concern or Comfort or complacency we can get stuck stuck in our walk and yet moving forward we must find ways to move through these things the same exact places and more that we go through we must move through loss grief trials hardships sufferings feelings of disappointments mistakes and sure headaches we must learn and move through these because we all got them they all happened to us my brothers and sisters they all come in our lives we were all experience these things but God's word is encouraged in US amen that we can press through these things we can keep moving forward we can keep moving with God no matter what we experience it's not the end it's only a Bend amen God God said I'll make all things work together for your good he didn't say some things all things that means loss death comes our way he'll make all things work together for good oh my still I imagine we we all find it easy to stay stuck then risk moving forward and that we might come with it like stepping out into unfamiliar train and feeling even more uncomfortable like experience more hurt more disappointment more suffering more betrayal is a little wonder the writer of Hebrews said that we must focus our eyes on Jesus fixing our eyes on Jesus the pioneer and Perfecter of our faith for the joy that set before him he endured the cross taken the shame and sat down at the right hand of God Amen that's who we're following this morning there ain't nobody that suffered like him there's nobody that went through what he went through he can be we can be touched by the feeling he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities because he knows everything in the Garden of Gethsemane he experienced every demon from hell he took it all he didn't leave nothing undone my brothers and sisters he gave you their complete package he gave you the complete warranty of your guaranteed amen that you're going to make it through you're going to overcome you're going to defeat everything that comes your way you're going to be able to move on and press on all power in Heaven and Earth is given to him and he's given you power to tread on serpents and all over all the power of the enemy what's standing in your way yourself get yourself out of the way believe the word of God take the word apply the word in your life in that area of your life and move forward get out of that stuck state the stuck condition that you're in speaker here speaking when the global pandemic hit in 2020 and then continue to unto 2021 like most everyone I was tempted to look back I wanted to go back to 2019. or the years of Our Lives before 2020. to go back to normal whatever normal was to forget all the new normal that we were all desperately trying to create yet no matter how much I long to go back to normal there was no going back listen I knew when that when that pandemic hit there was a shift in the spirit I set a rate from the beginning to my wife I said things will never go back to normal there's been a shift right listen God's truth is marching on but let me tell you Satan's agenda is marching on too and that was a big move amen a big shift in his agenda to move this new world's order amen the mark of the beasts amen the World Council of churches amen into its into gear and if that is happening what is God doing amen what is God doing in The Bride of Jesus Christ he only impersonates what God is doing you talk about a shift in The Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that much I long to go back to normal there was no going back that world as we knew it was finished and God was beckoning me along with everybody else to move forward and lay hold upon the purposes and Promises of the future of the word of God hallelujah amen glory to God now we see in the Bible here Hallelujah I still got time I still got time and I'm going to preach Hallelujah I'm the one up here sweating and not so you're just you just be patient with me oh I got hooked here Simon can you know when it's good got it hey man thank you brother Gabriel the Angel is always there to help amen now let us take a look at Lot's wife we look at Lot's wife in the Bible I never thought about this until I started reading in about it Lord's wife gets a small part in the Old Testament and a little small part in the New Testament that's it that's all the scripture records why would Jesus tell us to remember a woman who appears on the pages of the scriptures long enough to disappear a woman who has the shortest vital ever a woman who we don't even know her name think about it we don't even know her name it just says Lot's wife Hallelujah what is it about her that we are supposed to remember this woman was told one thing just like Eve was told don't eat of that tree if you do you'll die don't look back and the one thing she was told not to do is the one thing she did but lost wife from behind him foolishly longingly look back towards Sodom in an act of Disobedience and became a pillar assault think about it listen this message if it's telling us one thing don't look back don't look back move forward just like the scripture says amen when seven demons were cast out get that place filled with the word of God or else they'll come back with greater spirits Don't Look Back keep pressing forward amen she looked back longingly in an act of Disobedience we all make mistakes we all disobey at times and think she looked back longingly here she was living her life as usual and suddenly she was told to pack up and run for her life all the while the angel was holding her hand and guiding her listen think about it the angel was holding her hand and guiding them out of there out into safety listen haven't we had our angel don't we still got our angels holding our hand to faith in this hour guiding us out of here out of this out of this dimension and the angel holding her hand she long and she looked back and longing for those things behind there just think about it and became a pillar of salt dead paralyzed crippled by Looking Back what makes wife especially significant is that Jesus said for us to remember her in the middle of him preaching about death judgment and the final destination of the soul and human and humankind he disclosed in a New Testament and he dropped these three words remember Lot's wife think about it that Jesus stopped in the middle of his preaching Discerning the times Discerning the people's hearts because the word of God is quicker and sharper than any two-edged swords Discerning the very hearts of the people that he stopped and he says remember Lot's wife a warning Hebrews 10 38 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul amen that's who we are no way I'm determined more than ever to keep pressing on to keep moving on with this word no matter how hard it gets how deceiving it gets in my own walk in my own life I got to keep pressing on I I passed the point of no return there's nowhere to go back for me there's no place in this world for me oh my when you still think you got a place in this world when you still think you can get comfort and security in this world let me tell you this world is going to be taken from out of your feet amen it's going to be swept out God will not lose one all the fathers give me will come amen if he turns your world upside down he'll do it to get your obedience Just Surrender James 4 8 draw near to God and He will draw near to you cleanse your hands you Sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded that's a person who looks back a double-minded person when they're given the truth what more do you need what more do we need in this hour than the word of God it's the truth listen there the the that new uh AI intelligent agency uh system is creating a new Bible for the World Council of churches as we speak and going to say to this word of God Amen that we read from King James is going to be no good anymore let me tell you we are written Epistles read of all man they can take the written word away from me all they want because I am the word I am the living manifestation of the word how can they take that away from me Satan Can't Touch This is the pillar of fire this is behind the inner Veil where God's glory never fails oh my God glory to God he's a perverter amen that's good let everything happen because God is pushing his bride into reality into manifestation of his word step out step out and believe forget this church going amen I don't know what's going to happen in the future but if they close down the churches whatever they try to scatter us about they can't scatter him amen the more they try to scatter us the more God's spirit will grow and manifest that's the short quick work he's going to do he's going to push us out there he's going to push you out there whether you like it or not glory to God this word of God that you're coming to hear and preaching is preparing you for what's coming ahead so that you are not surprised amen you just move with the word of God glory to God hallelujah when Lot's wife longered and lingered then she became hardened and stuck and Frozen in Time paralyzed in it for eternity as a pill or salt think about it doesn't the Bible said endure hardness as a good soldier when we look back we get hard we all been there I've been there oh I walk you with the glory of God just like like like like the priest when they went back behind the the the inner Veil there where the glories the pillar of fire was and they came out there was still dust on their feet they realized they were still on Earth yes we are walking we are walking amen and we get into these we get in these conditions sometimes where we get hardened by the circumstances that happen in our lives Hallelujah but God is calling us to press through those times of hardness those times of disappointments those times of struggles amen he's trying to put a word inside of you reveal a word to you amen that you more than conquerors through him that that that overcame you're more than a conqueror to look to his word Hallelujah amen we get stuck in our emotions we get stuck in our thoughts in our attitudes our opinions our possessions that we have our plans our businesses our desires our habits our Comforts our pains our ruins our relationships our paths our presence and even our future hopes we get stuck in them we all do it's just that whether you have the ability by faith to step out to step out man of old man throughout the Bible went through odds that were impossible but they stepped out listen we got odds that seem impossible in this day and age oh my god oh Hallelujah a body changed you guys in that church preached a body change you mean you're going to be alive and remain and be caught up and be changed in a moment of Twinkle and I yes yes this is not my odd to overcome this is his odd that he's going to overcome he overcame back there in Abraham he overcame him Moses he overcame in David he's going to overcome me halleluia oh yes great odds doubt your delts doubt your delts doubt your situations tell them all be like Jonah when he's imaginary just imagine that I'm asking you to imagine that say yes I'm gonna imagine it because you're just going to listen to me it's going to go in and out one ear imagine that Jonah was in a whale's belly are you imagining it he was in the belly of a whale wow see when you start imagining that wow it's a whole different story when you just hear about it when you start imagining it he was in the whale's belly imagine if you went down to the beach amen and he was just sitting there enjoying the water and the whale came and swallowed you up and you found yourself in a whale's belly what you would be thinking but see Jordan I looked around when he came to his senses amen and he says all this is lying vanities what kind of Faith does he have to look at that being swole up by whales say all this is lion vanities but I'm going to look towards Jerusalem I'm going to look to the word of God they were where my help comes my help comes from the Lord they're not going to pray and look towards the word of God the will had to spit them out but I don't want this I don't want this ball of fire this hot potato I don't want to deal with that well imagine getting to a place where City says I want to deal with you get out of here just like Pharaoh get out of here take everything and go well I'm having a good time preaching this morning amen it's not always easy to move on but he beckons us forward especially when things are safe and comfortable and just the way we like it oh my well I look at that stuff I know I don't know what you're going to think but I look at that stuff and I say man when everything is going good you know everything is going perfect then I get on my knees and I start praying amen if I ain't disturbing the kingdom of Satan and I ain't getting him angry mad every day amen I'm not I'm doing something wrong hallelujah oh I got the devil mad all the Devils after me good good you're doing something right Hallelujah keep going keep keep taking out word keep pressing on amen hallelujah the matter he gets the glider I get amen that's the way it is Hallelujah often difficulties move on move into our lives we have experience of deep trauma pain suffering and feel of hopelessness helplessness moving on in this some something we know we should do what we often want to do and at times we actually refuse to do it is my prayer that you will be able to identify those places where you are prone to get stuck or maybe are stuck in right now and that you will refuse amen with the strength of the Holy Spirit and the word of God and take the next step by faith and get unstuck if we are stuck get take the word believe the word that's what he said only believe all things are possible get unstuck if your life is not on fire your prayer life is not on fire the word is not revealed get unstuck my brothers and sisters there should be a flow of the Holy Spirit God wants nothing more than reveal and speak to you and talk to you every day of your life he wants you to feel his presence all the time he wants to show you things to come be with you he wants to touch you heal you deliver you that's all he wants for you there's no bad in God there's only good in God loving God power overcoming power in God it's us we get stuck with this greatest enemy in our flesh things in our lives when you know you're you're under a spiritual talk loss of spiritual desire to stay on fire Galatians 5 14 First Corinthians 14. and you get unusual physical fatigue Isaiah 40 39 Philippians 4 13. if you are experienced constant sexual dreams you're under attack of the devil these are all realities my brothers and sisters these all will come and we meet we need to recognize these things and and by recognizing we take the word and we apply the word amen we applied what God has given us in prayer the power of prayer the power of the spoken word and we take it and we smash Satan's kingdom amen now listen to brother Brown here overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks that's what I'm saying don't you believe that there's no devil real devil he's just as real as any one of you else is here standing he's a devil he's a real devil and you must recognize him as real then at the same time you must recognize him and know that he's a devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god that is in you is greater and mightier than he that is in the world and the one that is in you has already overcome him and by his grace you are more than a match for him There's real overcoming when you recognize that's what we preach the whole series on that recognizing the Great Awakening that has taken place there's power in that there's power in that word there's so much in that word in this hour nobody like we said earlier recognizes who they are but God is bringing a people to recognize who they are even a devil don't know who he is he knows what he is he's a liar Chief a thief and all that stuff amen but he doesn't recognize where he's going amen he thinks he's going to be saved people saying he's going to be saved God's going to have mercy on him a good loving God laughs oh my I'm here to tell you Satan no in the Book of Revelations it says the Lake of Fire that's where my God's going to send you I came to understand that acknowledging such endings and Beginnings is necessary to step forward and moving forward and I liken to it like Joshua experience after the death of Moses through the final chapter of Deuteronomy shows us that when Moses died God buried him and then God declared a time of mourning for Joshua and the children of Israel on the next very page of the Bible in the first two verses of the Book of Joshua God says to Joshua my servant Moses my servant is dead now you and all the people prepared to cross over Jordan to the land I am given the Israelites I can ask can I ask help but us why did God State the obvious to Joshua question mark doesn't Joshua know Moses is dead especially since God declared a season of mourning for Moses and yet God tells Joshua that Moses is dead and prepare to cross over signaling that one season had ended and a new season had started listen there's a there's there's a a message in there that's why he had to repeat it Joshua knew that Moses was dead there was a morning going on but then God had to come back again and say Moses is dead crossover move forward don't stay back in Moses Ministry cross over in Joshua's Ministry the Holy Ghost we know our our Moses is brother Branham brother Branham is dead now Joshua and calebs are here amen they're here this morning cross over keep moving forward glory to God amen just like Caleb brother Simon I was thinking about you amen Caleb in his old age he says old age give me that mountain give me that mountain I'll take that mountain Hallelujah oh my you talk about the word of God being so real in Joshua and Caleb amen age don't mean nothing when the word is on fire this this don't have an age inside it's eternally young amen this that's burning inside of me Revelation don't have the age on it it's just as new to me as it was when God opened my eyes 32 years ago or even more so you know I'm still on fire with it glory to God hallelujah amen no doubt in all our lives they're filled with transitions some we anticipate and some that Catches Us by surprise but in all of them there are opportunities for us to look back and get stuck or look ahead and keep moving on that's what it's all about my brothers and sisters that's why all these things come that's why Peter said Rejoice through your trials and troubles they're here to perfect you establish you strengthen you make you settle oh man build that those characters of Christ inside of you bring out those virtues out of you amen Hallelujah that's why when when Peter came and he recognized he recognized that through all that he went through amen he recognized that he says rejoice amen God deals with you God chastens you because God loves you because you've got a purpose in him amen hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord amen not every transition is hard of course but many of them are easier to move through than others perhaps because they are things that we prayed for or or dreamed about or worked hard for there are big wins in lives but for those transitions that we prayed not for and hope not for and desired not for if they ever happen there is a need to be a season of mourning first what more it's important to keep in mind that morning is for when anything dies a dream a hope a plan a goal a relationship all these things haven't we had them I know I've had them there's a time of warning these are simple things in our lives that we go through we experience but these these simple things that we go through and that are part of our life can affect our walk if we don't have the right positive mental attitude towards the word of God in these things that's what the spirit of God is saying we we can have a time of mourning you've been disappointed your dreams your hopes things you thought God was going to do in your life things you've you believed God was going to do and you've been disappointed but God Knows Best and that's who we trust in above all these things above above all our hopes and our dreams and what we think and what we interpret we trust him that he knows best what's best for our lives not trusting in the Lord keeps growing and growing more and more Hallelujah Now quickly I'm going to start winding this down there are eight ways to move forward stop letting the opinions of other control your life give up feeling shamed about your past failures be more decisive about what you want be certain of what you want stop procrastinating on goals quit choosing to do nothing that's a big one quit choosing to do nothing do something take a step of faith believe for something if you don't believe what are you going to believe nothing that nothing out of nothing gets you nothing you want more of God and take a step of faith and give them more of yourself Hallelujah you don't always need to be right stop running from your problems that you should be fixing don't make excuse excuses instead of decisions change in your mind and changing your plans then the Lord said to Moses why are you crying to me tell the Israelites to move on raise your stuff stretch out your hand over the sea and divide the waters so that the Israelites can go through on dry ground Moses stretched out his hands Over the Sea and over the and all that night the Lord drove the sea back with a strong East Wind and turned it into dry land the waters were divided let me tell you when you're praying amen just wait be patient with God because when you start praying for something God is driving back the waters he's driving back the enemies all night he was driving back those Waters amen he's working on your situation he's working in your life he's driving it back just believe never stop believing remember brother Brown says amen faith will bring it to you and it's coming it takes time but doubt will push it away keep believing keep having faith oh Hallelujah glory to God Amen amen thank you Lord Exodus 14 21 are instructed as how God's purpose we deal with our emotional uh stuckness while Moses was talking about standing firm think about it Moses was saying stand firm God told him to move on amen move on Hallelujah I'm going to wind it down now invite The Magicians up thank you Lord got a couple quotes here I want to read they're a blessing brother Brown speaking in here he swore by himself just walk unconsciously of fear walk unconsciously of criticism walk unconsciously unto the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him pay no attention to the right hand or to the left just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with God if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep walking with God Enoch walked like that one day and you know what was done he walked all the way home for God took him he was so far up the road he didn't want to come back he was so far into Revelation he was walking all these years amen taking the word taking feeding on the word hallelujah stepping out on the word becoming the word amen he walks so far up ahead amen the God says you've got to come home oh my this bride is walking like that brother I'm speaking here perfect faith and so when a man or a woman lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance Faith he's isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride material see see you're getting into Rapture condition that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with God Alone whatever he says there's no Shadow of Doubt nowhere you just walk right on now you're coming into perfect Faith now listen now when you're walking on when you're moving on now you're coming into perfect faith that perfect Perfection and that faith can never fail amen how do you want your faith to become perfect when you don't allow it to manifest in your life amen what it's telling you to do glory to God the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving amongst the bride with a love affair pouring out to her Hallelujah brother Brown speaking here in the greatest battle ever fought don't stop for nothing you got the message Jesus Lives God Is A Healer that's the message that's when Satan walked up right up to the mine and said well it sounds reasonable oh don't you do that [Music] just take what God Said Abraham what if he wouldn't and had to stop for a reasoning when God told him he was going to have a baby which by Sarah against all people leave God's word faith is beyond hope faith comes from way back here from the inside Hallelujah you see but see God's Great Army is moving forward amen men of valored man of Faith man of power man of understanding they don't have to be smart they don't have to be educated all they have to be is channels God takes those channels and he moves his word forth through those channels they'll surrender channels Hallelujah [Music] brother Brandon was sitting on his bed you all know the vision and he's speaking here beyond the curtain of time I Heard a Voice saying you are just starting
