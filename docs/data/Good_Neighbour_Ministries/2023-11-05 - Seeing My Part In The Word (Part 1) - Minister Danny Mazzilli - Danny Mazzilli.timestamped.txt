[42:39] the world and the conditions of The
[42:40] World God bless you Saints thank you
[42:43] praise God we see that the hour of
[42:45] redemption draweth nigh we know that um
[42:49] the the scripture said very clearly when
[42:50] we start to see these things taking
[42:53] place around us and now we're seeing it
[42:56] on a daily basis we're seeing prophecy
[42:58] being fulfilled we're seeing um you know
[43:01] the the condition of Israel the state of
[43:05] uh Israel and what is happening there
[43:07] and you know I mean we could we could
[43:10] sit here and we could try to interpret
[43:11] everything but God is interpreting it
[43:13] all he's making it very clear you know
[43:16] we had this um this uh terrible attack
[43:19] back on October the 7th you know um I
[43:23] heard you know
[43:25] 107 there it is right there's 10:7 again
[43:28] it's in the scriptures we hear about it
[43:30] Revelations 10:7 we know the hour that
[43:33] we're living in what does it do right on
[43:35] October the 7th Bingo there it is in
[43:38] Israel um you know we're not putting any
[43:42] interpretation on that but all we know
[43:44] is that it's the hour it's the hour of
[43:47] Revelations 10:7 we know that it's the
[43:49] time in the season of The Mighty Angel
[43:51] and he's on the earth and he is dealing
[43:54] with everything
[43:57] but right now especially with you and me
[44:00] personally this is about a personal walk
[44:03] with the Lord and um it's important for
[44:06] us to recognize the hour that we're
[44:08] living in and to see where we fit into
[44:11] this whole prophetic event amen praise
[44:15] God and so this morning um we W to
[44:21] continue along the the theme of seeing
[44:25] yourself in the word
[44:26] um I believe it's something that um is
[44:29] absolutely vital in this hour it's what
[44:32] differentiates us as Christians in this
[44:37] world where everybody is claiming
[44:39] Christianity everybody's got an
[44:40] interpretation on the word of God
[44:42] everybody believes a certain aspect and
[44:45] they'll believe it in a certain way and
[44:47] you've got a trinitarian belief and
[44:49] you've got all kinds of different
[44:51] beliefs and um what's happened is that
[44:55] because they do not actually see
[44:58] themselves in the word they don't see
[45:02] the truth truth is the only thing that
[45:05] identifies you in the word of God and
[45:08] your life will will reflect the word of
[45:12] God and you know to say you're a
[45:14] Christian and have a different
[45:16] interpretation on God's word because of
[45:18] man's Doctrine or teaching it it Alters
[45:22] everything God can never honor man's
[45:26] teachings man's ideas man's
[45:29] interpretations and that's why it's of
[45:31] vital importance that we we allow the
[45:34] word of God to be The Interpreter Amen
[45:38] in this day and in this hour praise God
[45:41] so we're going to go to the first slide
[45:42] we're going to read um the scripture
[45:44] that we've been reading um over the last
[45:47] couple of services today we're going to
[45:50] we're going to just continue along a
[45:53] different uh uh frame it's still under
[45:57] the same series of rapturing Faith right
[46:00] this is the series that we've been um
[46:02] working on for many months now and I
[46:06] believe that there's rapturing Faith
[46:07] that's being re released to the bride
[46:10] and it all encompasses
[46:13] everything in the word of God for this
[46:15] day and this hour and what we're looking
[46:17] at here amen second Corinthians it says
[46:20] but we all with open face beholding as
[46:24] in a glass the glory of the Lord and
[46:27] changed into the same are changed into
[46:31] the same image from glory to glory even
[46:35] as by the spirit of the
[46:38] Lord and we're going to continue with
[46:40] another scripture
[46:42] here and today we're going to be looking
[46:44] at
[46:45] seeing my part in the word and so we'll
[46:49] be looking at it and it's it's just
[46:51] foundational we're still foundational in
[46:54] in all of this this is going to be a
[46:55] series that'll probably go on well into
[46:58] the new year by God's grace but let's
[47:01] just see what the Lord is going to do
[47:02] and Ephesians chapter 2: 20 and 22 it
[47:06] says and are built upon the foundations
[47:09] of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus
[47:13] Christ himself being the Chief
[47:17] Cornerstone in whom all building fitly
[47:20] framed together groweth unto an Holy
[47:24] Temple in the Lord
[47:26] in whom ye also are builded together for
[47:30] an habitation of God through the spirit
[47:35] amen let's pray
[47:36] father we so appreciate Lord this
[47:39] opportunity to come and fellowship
[47:42] around your word and to uh allow your

[47:51] Angel allow your spirit your anointing
[47:54] your word your your purpose your plan
[47:57] for each and every life to take control
[47:59] and to speak and Lord it is only then
[48:02] that we can truly be built and fitly
[48:07] joined together into this body that you
[48:11] have prepared in this last day Lord we
[48:14] ask your blessing upon the word of God
[48:17] may you anoint hearer and speaker this
[48:19] morning Lord we're we're just going to
[48:22] relax and allow your spirit to take
[48:25] control

[48:29] give you all the glory we thank you for
[48:31] touching our pastor for raising him up
[48:34] Lord remember the brothers uh Pastor

[48:40] they as they are brother coffee now in
[48:43] Africa ministering as they would go

[48:47] anointing move and go before them and
[48:51] and and and create the path that they
[48:55] must walk walk upon Lord to bring your
[48:57] word in season in the in the present
[49:01] stage of your ministry Lord use them in
[49:03] a supernatural way place an a a a

[49:25] commit them into your hands For Your
[49:27] Glory and Honor in Jesus name amen
[49:30] praise God you may be seated
[49:33] Saints
[49:35] Hallelujah glory to
[49:37] God so this morning we want to look at
[49:41] um we want to look at the fivefold
[49:44] ministry we want to look at what is the
[49:47] five-fold ministry we want to lay in
[49:49] some Foundation because I believe that
[49:51] if we have a a clear understanding how
[49:54] it is that God is speaking and
[49:56] communicating and doing what he is doing
[49:59] in this day and in this hour under the
[50:01] message of this hour it's important that
[50:04] we understand the ministry it's
[50:07] important that we understand the
[50:08] ministry that we are a part of how we
[50:11] fit how God has designed the ministry in
[50:14] such a way and when we look at the
[50:17] scripture you can go to the next
[50:19] slide we can look at the scripture in in
[50:22] chap in Ephesians chapter 4 from verses
[50:25] 11 to18 we're going to read this and
[50:27] then we're going to talk about it and he
[50:30] gave some Apostles and some prophets and
[50:35] some evangelists and some pastors and
[50:39] teachers for the perfecting of the
[50:42] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[50:45] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[50:49] we all come in the unity of the faith
[50:53] and of the knowledge of the son of God
[50:55] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[50:59] of the stature of the fullness of
[51:03] Christ amen so we know that we're going
[51:06] to come into the fullness of Christ
[51:09] because that's what this scripture is
[51:10] telling us there's going to be a church
[51:13] that is going to come into the fullness
[51:16] of Jesus Christ amen as as to this earth
[51:20] and how this world and this Earth is
[51:23] interpreting Jesus Christ unless they
[51:26] can recognize this scripture and
[51:28] understand what it is that it's doing
[51:30] then they will never come into the
[51:32] fullness of
[51:36] Christ that we henceforth now pay
[51:40] attention be no more children tossed to
[51:45] and fro and
[51:47] carried about with every wind of
[51:50] Doctrine by the slight of man and
[51:53] cunning craftiness whereby they let they
[51:56] lie in weight to deceive but speaking
[51:59] the truth in love may grow up into him
[52:04] in all things which is the head even
[52:08] Christ from whom the whole body fitly
[52:12] joined together and compacted by that
[52:16] which every joint supplieth according to
[52:20] the effectual working in the measure of
[52:24] every part maketh increase of the body
[52:27] unto the edifying of
[52:31] itself in love praise God forever more I
[52:37] mean there is just so much right there
[52:40] praise God but let's let's just take a
[52:42] look at a few things here's some notes
[52:45] you know I'm going to lay in a little
[52:46] bit of history about the fivefold
[52:48] ministry and um you know when we talk
[52:50] about the fivefold ministry what is it
[52:53] that we're actually talking about are we
[52:55] talking about today are we talking about
[53:00] what's taken place over the last couple
[53:01] of hundred years
[53:04] because the one that we're talking about
[53:09] is the one that is mentioned here in
[53:11] Ephesians chapter 4 and you know some
[53:15] will identify this chapter and this
[53:19] actual scripture as the Ascension gifts
[53:22] that Paul wrote about in Ephesians
[53:26] because it's said here that you know if
[53:28] you read the actual scripture Jesus
[53:33] ascended because he had descended God
[53:37] ascended because he had descended and
[53:40] while he was here he was displaying all
[53:43] these gifts in his ministry if you look
[53:47] back into his ministry you will see that
[53:49] Jesus was displaying every aspect of
[53:53] this gift and
[53:56] so over time it got kind of lost through
[54:00] the Dark Ages and you know the the
[54:03] church went through all kinds of change
[54:05] and we've come through the church ages
[54:08] but back in
[54:10] 1824 there was a gentleman by the name
[54:13] of Edward iring and he was a
[54:15] presbyterian Pastor in Scotland and he
[54:17] began teaching that the fivefold
[54:20] ministry of the Apostles the prophets
[54:22] the evangelists pastors and teachers had
[54:26] disappeared it's never
[54:29] disappeared but this is this is the
[54:31] world that we're living in now and these
[54:34] are the different kinds of
[54:35] interpretations of the fivefold ministry
[54:38] and how they're interpreting it and how
[54:39] they're seeing this right and so and you
[54:43] got to look and so I'm just bringing you
[54:44] a little bit of a history here so that
[54:46] we can come up to the day that we're in
[54:48] okay so that we can actually see what is
[54:50] the the true fivefold Ministry and why
[54:53] God Has It has never ever stopped it's
[54:58] always been in progress and and it's
[55:00] still going to be in progress and it's
[55:02] going to take us onto the fullness of
[55:04] Christ amen praise God but this this
[55:09] gentleman thought that it disappeared
[55:10] from the church and and it was in need
[55:12] of restoration so according to Irving
[55:14] the restoration of these Ministries
[55:16] would usher in the millennial Kingdom of
[55:19] Christ on the earth and we know that
[55:22] this fivefold ministry is going to usher
[55:24] in
[55:25] the millennial Kingdom but we need to
[55:27] understand what the fivefold ministry
[55:31] is irban and his followers began What's
[55:34] called the Catholic Apostolic church and
[55:37] it was established uh in In
[55:40] 1832 and he established 12 Apostles and
[55:44] he sent these Apostles out and he was
[55:47] figuring that you know God had given
[55:49] them him the Revelation that it was time
[55:52] for you know for for the church to be
[55:54] restored
[55:55] because the millennial kingdom was about
[55:57] to take place in
[56:01] 1896 another congregational Minister
[56:04] named John Alexander Dai founded the
[56:07] Christian Catholic
[56:09] Church in 1901 with 5,000 followers Dai
[56:14] established the city of Zion in
[56:17] Northeast Illinois in 1904 Dai announced
[56:20] that he had been divinely commissioned
[56:23] to be the first Apostle
[56:27] he then told his followers to anticipate
[56:29] the full restoration of the of apostolic
[56:33] Christianity now he was catching some
[56:37] inspiration he was you know obviously
[56:39] God is you know moving God is is his
[56:42] spirit is moving and and individuals are
[56:45] going to pick up just like Luther picked
[56:47] up you know the the the Revelation on
[56:49] justification just like Wesley picked up
[56:52] on sanctification and now we were and
[56:54] now here here they were entering this is
[56:56] look at 1906 this is when it was
[56:58] happening 1901 1904 and then you know in
[57:02] 1906 the community of Believers in the
[57:05] city of Zion began to break down and da
[57:09] he passed away the following year so he
[57:11] died just just in 1907 but here God was
[57:15] was moving in the power of his
[57:17] resurrection and individuals were
[57:19] catching inspiration because the spirit
[57:22] of God is a living present
[57:25] uh uh God that interprets his own word
[57:28] that he's moving and he's going to use
[57:30] man and he's going to inspire man and
[57:32] people are going to pick up on the
[57:34] revelation of what God is doing amen and
[57:38] so following the famed ofua Street
[57:41] Revival which took place in 1906 in Los
[57:43] Angeles California the emphasis of the
[57:46] restoration of the five-fold ministry
[57:49] and a mighty outpouring of the Holy
[57:51] Spirit just returned just before the
[57:55] return of Christ reappeared and a new
[57:57] generation of Apostles emerged from that
[58:00] great movement in in isua Street and
[58:03] there was individuals here that are
[58:05] named you know one was an apostle to
[58:07] Italy another one to the to the
[58:09] slovenians another one to Europe another
[58:12] one you know Pentecostal denominations
[58:15] in Wales New Zealand Australia Canada
[58:18] the United States this was the
[58:20] Pentecostal movement this was the gifts
[58:22] coming back to the church it was a
[58:24] mighty move of God all part of the
[58:27] five-fold ministry amen all aspects of
[58:30] the holy spirit because it who gave the
[58:36] gifts who's The Giver of the gifts Jesus
[58:39] you see these individuals were were were
[58:42] inspired and they figured you know the
[58:44] five-fold ministry you know we need to
[58:46] raise up Apostles we need to raise up
[58:49] evangelists we need to raise up prophets
[58:52] God was doing it in their midst
[58:55] and they couldn't recognize the present
[58:58] stage of the ministry the ones that
[59:01] recognized that the spirit of God was re
[59:03] restoring the gifts which was the
[59:04] Pentecostal movement they were starting
[59:07] to see more and more what was going on
[59:09] but God had in 1909 on April the 9th a
[59:14] man by the name of William branam to be
[59:17] born in burksville
[59:19] Kentucky uh in order to to prepare a man
[59:23] that would be the prophet a real Prophet
[59:25] amen because prophets you know in the
[59:28] Bible part of the fivefold ministry
[59:30] there's there's Minor Prophets and
[59:32] there's Major
[59:34] Prophets and God was sending a major
[59:38] prophet to the Earth Amen to restore the
[59:41] word amen praise God hallelujah and so
[59:46] as the years rolled on after this
[59:49] 1906 uh
[59:53] movement things began to fade away again
[59:55] with the five-fold
[59:57] ministry and they didn't realize what
[1:00:00] was actually going on but God was
[1:00:03] raising up a prophet God had birthed
[1:00:08] from the
[1:00:09] womb you know prophets they are known of
[1:00:12] God they are ordained of God they are
[1:00:14] ordained from before the foundations of
[1:00:17] the world a true Prophet is not somebody
[1:00:21] that that that just decides okay I'm
[1:00:23] going to go to the church and I believe
[1:00:25] I've got a gift of prophecy on me I'm
[1:00:27] going to get the preachers to pray over
[1:00:29] me and that the spirit of Prophecy come
[1:00:32] upon me and that I be a prophet in the
[1:00:34] land that's not the way it works
[1:00:36] remember God gave the gifts amen God
[1:00:40] gives the gift God gives the ministry
[1:00:43] God is inspiring uh every aspect of the
[1:00:47] true five-fold Ministry it's always been
[1:00:50] Christ amen it's not man that that says
[1:00:53] oh we're going to put this brother as a
[1:00:55] as a a a a missionary we're going to put
[1:00:57] this brother as an evangelist we're
[1:00:59] going to put this brother as a a a pre a
[1:01:03] pastor we're going to ordain this one
[1:01:05] here as a as a teacher no that's not the
[1:01:08] way it works if God has a a gift that
[1:01:13] he's placed in your life it was there
[1:01:17] before the foundations of the world
[1:01:19] because you're an attribute of God
[1:01:21] you're a part of the word that's going
[1:01:23] to be a that's going to be part of the
[1:01:25] makeup of this fullness of Christ this
[1:01:28] body of Christ that's coming into her
[1:01:31] fullness right now in Bride form we need
[1:01:34] to realize the hour that we're living in
[1:01:37] and what it is that God is doing in this
[1:01:39] day in this hour and how his word is
[1:01:42] being released to the people to the
[1:01:45] Earth and to Christianity across the
[1:01:49] world period God has his own provided
[1:01:53] way of releasing and
[1:01:56] unveiling his word amen and he's always
[1:01:59] been his own interpreter amen praise
[1:02:02] God let's look at the next
[1:02:05] slide
[1:02:08] Hallelujah he gives gifts to
[1:02:11] people God gives the gifts not man God
[1:02:16] Anointed The Apostles back in the old
[1:02:18] test in the in the New Testament the New
[1:02:21] Testament Apostles like the scripture
[1:02:23] that we read in Ephesians chapter 2 upon
[1:02:26] the foundations of the Apostles and the
[1:02:28] prophets but Jesus Christ is still the
[1:02:32] Chief Cornerstone he is the he is the
[1:02:34] all and all and through all he is the
[1:02:38] beginning and the end all things exist
[1:02:40] by him amen praise God the world the
[1:02:44] worlds were were were framed by the word
[1:02:47] of God Amen we could never lose this
[1:02:51] thought and this foundational
[1:02:53] understanding that it's Jesus Christ he
[1:02:56] is the backbone of every Ministry of
[1:02:59] every calling of every individual that's
[1:03:03] placed in Ministry of every attribute of
[1:03:06] God God is in there and he's got a
[1:03:09] portion of himself in you that he needs
[1:03:12] to come into its rightful position so
[1:03:14] that you can see your part in the word
[1:03:17] of God too many people are tossed to and
[1:03:21] fro about well what do I do in the
[1:03:23] church what am I supposed to do I don't
[1:03:26] know your
[1:03:27] part your part will be interpreted by
[1:03:31] your life and by the Revelation that
[1:03:33] you're living by amen thank you your
[1:03:36] your life is going to interpret to me
[1:03:38] whether you whe whether you're an
[1:03:40] attribute of God or not you're going to
[1:03:43] believe the word you're going to see the
[1:03:44] word we're going to see eye to eye when
[1:03:47] it comes to the revelation of the word
[1:03:50] but God has diversities of gifts right
[1:03:53] within the ministry and God has
[1:03:55] different in you know ways of the word
[1:03:57] being expressed through each and every
[1:04:00] one of us I'm not going to express it
[1:04:02] the same way that Tim expresses it or
[1:04:04] Desmond expresses it or Phillip or Chris
[1:04:07] or Pastor Simon I'm G to express it the
[1:04:10] way God designed me to express it amen
[1:04:13] the way God has given me Faith in
[1:04:15] Revelation to express it I can only
[1:04:18] express the Revelation that I have I'm
[1:04:21] not going to turn around and say I got
[1:04:23] higher revelation than you I Got What I
[1:04:26] Got by the grace of God the moment I
[1:04:29] start saying well I can see things
[1:04:31] higher than you or I can I can see no no
[1:04:34] that's arrogance that's what that is
[1:04:37] because you're only seeing what you're
[1:04:39] seeing by the grace of God and what God
[1:04:42] is revealing to you as a part of the
[1:04:44] body and you're no more important than I
[1:04:48] am and I am no more important than you
[1:04:51] are we are all parts of the body of
[1:04:54] Jesus Christ all these man uh you know
[1:04:57] man's ways of interpreting the word of
[1:05:00] God and interpreting the five-fold
[1:05:01] ministry they've messed it up they make
[1:05:05] a mess of it and they actually push out
[1:05:08] the Holy Ghost and they want to they
[1:05:11] want to implement their own ideas their
[1:05:13] own interpretation no no he's an apostle
[1:05:16] oh no no he's not a pastor he should
[1:05:18] have never been a pastor he should have
[1:05:21] been a a an evangelist
[1:05:24] who who are you or who am I or anybody
[1:05:27] to say what God is going to how God is
[1:05:29] going to design each and every one of
[1:05:32] his attributes amen and it's God if you
[1:05:36] believe in the Supernatural element of
[1:05:39] that that Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll
[1:05:42] build my church it's not going to be
[1:05:44] built upon man it's not going to be
[1:05:47] built upon man's ideas of how a church
[1:05:49] should run and how it should operate
[1:05:52] it's built on the revelation of Jesus
[1:05:55] Christ and when God wants to anoint an
[1:05:59] individual to fulfill a certain office
[1:06:03] he'll do it amen he will anoint you in
[1:06:07] whatever capacity he has given you Faith
[1:06:11] to fulfill amen you can never be me I
[1:06:15] could never be you but we all need one
[1:06:19] another amen hallelujah praise God and
[1:06:22] that's what we want to really look into
[1:06:25] so Apostles if you want to just look at
[1:06:28] it in in you know in in simple you know
[1:06:31] understanding Apostles they govern the
[1:06:33] church prophets they guide the church
[1:06:37] evangelists gathers the church pastors
[1:06:40] they guard the church teachers they
[1:06:42] ground the church and I want you to
[1:06:44] notice here too in in in Ephesians where
[1:06:47] he talked about you know pastors and
[1:06:51] teachers I want you to notice those two
[1:06:53] kind of come together they're like the
[1:06:57] yeah there's there's individuals that
[1:06:58] are really you know uh amazing teachers
[1:07:01] that can break the word down and you
[1:07:04] know lay in such history and foundation
[1:07:06] and everything else and then the pastor
[1:07:09] you know as as a a Shepherd guiding and
[1:07:11] guarding and watching over his his flock
[1:07:14] but you know uh you know you will see
[1:07:17] both aspects in a pastor you know
[1:07:20] sometimes God will have to use those
[1:07:23] those
[1:07:24] gifts all through one
[1:07:27] person sometimes you'll use it through
[1:07:29] one person based on availability within
[1:07:32] the ministry because it's required
[1:07:34] within the church it's needed within the
[1:07:37] church for this this uh anointing in
[1:07:40] this Revelation because remember God
[1:07:43] gave the five-fold ministry and the
[1:07:45] Ministries themselves to us so that we
[1:07:49] could be perfected am so that we could
[1:07:52] be edified it's all part of the
[1:07:56] edification and so God can sometimes put
[1:07:59] a spirit of of an evangelist on a pastor
[1:08:03] and and the spirit of a of a a a prophet
[1:08:06] where he's where he he can he can
[1:08:08] prophesy where he's got the ability to
[1:08:10] speak in tongues interpret the
[1:08:12] prophecy amen we need to see that we
[1:08:16] don't put you know we don't want to put
[1:08:19] guidelines on God's way of equipping the
[1:08:22] church and God's way of an anointing
[1:08:24] individuals and using
[1:08:26] individuals we want to allow the Holy
[1:08:29] Spirit to have his way
[1:08:31] period so that we can surrender
[1:08:34] ourselves and recognize the the message
[1:08:37] of this hour amen you know like you know
[1:08:41] they talk about you know that oh you
[1:08:42] just need to play the tapes you only
[1:08:44] need to play the tapes but wait a minute
[1:08:47] I do play the tapes I listen to the
[1:08:50] prophet I love the word of of of of God
[1:08:55] coming through the prophet I I agree
[1:08:58] with the prophet there's nothing I
[1:08:59] disagree
[1:09:01] with praise God but when you're telling
[1:09:04] me that all I need is
[1:09:06] that I'm going to say wait a minute God
[1:09:10] gave to the
[1:09:12] church pastors teachers evangelists
[1:09:16] prophets Apostles hang on a minute God
[1:09:18] gave those to the church you show me
[1:09:21] where he took them away yeah
[1:09:24] where where did it end I can show you
[1:09:27] where it started it started right there
[1:09:29] in the day of Pentecost when that
[1:09:31] anointing started to come down it was
[1:09:33] the spirit of Jesus Christ he says you
[1:09:37] go and wait you go and wait I'm going to
[1:09:39] send you the comforter which is the holy
[1:09:44] spirit which is me in spirit form and he
[1:09:48] will come in you and guide you into all
[1:09:51] truth that has never ever ever changed
[1:09:55] amen praise God you need the Holy Ghost
[1:09:58] to lead you and guide you into perfect
[1:10:01] Faith so that you can be in the
[1:10:09] Rapture so don't tell me all you got to
[1:10:11] do is listen to the
[1:10:14] tapes it's more than that it's Christ in
[1:10:17] the present stage of his
[1:10:19] ministry yes much was fulfilled through
[1:10:22] the ministry of William ROM and much is
[1:10:25] still being fulfilled through the
[1:10:27] ministry but don't make it the absolute
[1:10:30] and total you you no you don't need a
[1:10:33] pastor you don't need no and I know that
[1:10:35] that's not what's being said out of
[1:10:37] voice of God I I I hear Brother Joseph
[1:10:40] saying I'm part of the five-fold
[1:10:42] ministry I'm one of those ministers I
[1:10:45] get out there and Minister and I say
[1:10:47] Amen brother that's the truth but then
[1:10:49] you're going to get some that are going
[1:10:51] to be on the on the on the sidelines
[1:10:53] that are going to be saying no I don't
[1:10:55] need to be under a pastor you see
[1:10:57] they're using it as an excuse I can just
[1:11:00] send my tithes where I want no your
[1:11:03] tides are supposed to go where you get
[1:11:05] fed amen that's where you when you go to
[1:11:08] a restaurant we've heard our pastor say
[1:11:10] you go to a restaurant and you eat a
[1:11:12] nice five course meal you're not going
[1:11:14] to get up and leave and the the waiters
[1:11:18] going where you going no I'm going to go
[1:11:20] pay my bill over there at Kelsey I like
[1:11:21] that place wait a minute you just ate
[1:11:25] here what are you going over there for
[1:11:27] no you see like I'm just using an
[1:11:29] example there but the holy spirit is not
[1:11:32] the author of
[1:11:33] confusion he's going to make it clear
[1:11:36] where you belong where you are being fed
[1:11:39] where you where you your heart burns
[1:11:42] within you when you hear the word of God
[1:11:45] being preached and you know that that's
[1:11:47] God speaking to me that's God placing me
[1:11:50] that's God giving me the faith to
[1:11:53] actually move move into my position in
[1:11:55] the church so that I can be an effectual
[1:11:58] joint in the body of Jesus Christ that's
[1:12:00] what we're going to be looking at as we
[1:12:02] move through this whole series I want
[1:12:05] like my goal and my desire is that the
[1:12:08] Holy Spirit would just would just come
[1:12:10] into our midst through this ministry
[1:12:12] through the preaching and that the
[1:12:14] spirit of God will speak to you
[1:12:17] personally I can only give you my
[1:12:19] thoughts my my the notes that I the
[1:12:21] research that I put together but it
[1:12:23] takes takes the spirit of God to speak
[1:12:26] to you personally in your heart so that
[1:12:29] you know that hey I understand now what
[1:12:32] it is to be a Christian it's not just
[1:12:35] belonging to this church because I like
[1:12:37] this pastor or belonging to this church
[1:12:39] because it's more convenient it's closer
[1:12:41] to my home oh I belong to this church
[1:12:44] because you know they don't they don't
[1:12:46] ask for for ties and offerings you see
[1:12:49] when somebody is using the excuse that
[1:12:52] you don't need need a five-fold Ministry
[1:12:55] it's probably because they don't want to
[1:12:57] come under headship to the word of God
[1:13:00] Amen it's as simple as that they don't
[1:13:02] want to pay their tithes they don't want
[1:13:05] to that's right they feel like no I
[1:13:07] don't have to give my money to a man
[1:13:09] because that's no I'm going to give it
[1:13:10] to the ministry of Jesus Christ and the
[1:13:13] ministry of Jesus Christ was fulfilled
[1:13:15] through William brandom and so I don't
[1:13:17] need to believe anything else I can just
[1:13:20] I can just all my my offerings all my
[1:13:23] tithing I'm just going to focus it there
[1:13:26] and I don't need to belong to a church
[1:13:29] but yet the scripture says here and I've
[1:13:32] read it over and over again until we all
[1:13:35] come into the unity of the faith that
[1:13:39] means Revelation that means a revelation
[1:13:43] of the Rapture if that was already
[1:13:46] fulfilled and we didn't need the
[1:13:47] five-fold ministry then the Rapture is
[1:13:49] already
[1:13:51] gone come on now yes amen let's bring
[1:13:55] this where it's supposed to
[1:13:56] be what hour are we living in amen glory
[1:14:00] to God go to the next slide and so when
[1:14:02] we look at this we see it as leadership
[1:14:05] and fathering the apostles you know we
[1:14:07] see spiritual Insight Clarity of vision
[1:14:10] listen if we've ever received Clarity of
[1:14:12] vision through a prophetic Ministry it
[1:14:14] is through the ministry of William
[1:14:16] Mariam brandom if you have not looked
[1:14:20] deeply and read and and researched
[1:14:23] very closely with an open heart not
[1:14:27] based on because you see a lot of people
[1:14:30] you know you tell them about William
[1:14:31] brandom and they go to the Google right
[1:14:32] away Google and and it'll say and and
[1:14:35] they'll be they'll be lying here ly line
[1:14:37] line cult oh hang on a minute here this
[1:14:40] is a
[1:14:42] cult this is a cult oh you following a
[1:14:44] cult you you you're following a man
[1:14:46] Danny no did did you read did you sit
[1:14:50] long enough to search the scriptures for
[1:14:53] in them you think you have eternal life
[1:14:57] did you look deep enough did you
[1:14:59] prayerfully go there without a critical
[1:15:02] spirit without the kind of spirit that
[1:15:05] that's out there today that's that's so
[1:15:07] skeptical and and you know they got they
[1:15:09] got a theory for this and they've got a
[1:15:11] and and oh there's a there's another you
[1:15:13] know what do they call those theories
[1:15:16] you know that that they keep coming out
[1:15:18] with and everything else you know
[1:15:22] and
[1:15:23] exactly oh this another conspiracy
[1:15:26] theory to get your money to get you to
[1:15:28] follow another man don't you know that
[1:15:31] they talked about this don't you know
[1:15:32] that they saw this don't no don't you
[1:15:35] know that this scripture was fulfilled
[1:15:39] don't you know that it was it was
[1:15:42] Vindicated even by the FBI that there
[1:15:45] was a supernatural light that that that
[1:15:47] haloed over his head don't you know that
[1:15:51] it was doctor's affidavit Davids one
[1:15:54] after the other that said this person
[1:15:56] was
[1:15:58] dead and now they live this person had
[1:16:03] cancer and now it's
[1:16:05] gone why because God was vindicating his
[1:16:09] word but people don't want to go all the
[1:16:13] way guess what they're not designed
[1:16:19] to but let an attribute of God get a
[1:16:22] hold of that word
[1:16:24] and something awaken on the inside of
[1:16:26] the inside let me tell you they're not
[1:16:29] going to stop they're not they can't
[1:16:31] stop because something has awakened
[1:16:33] inside of them that says that's the
[1:16:35] truth I don't I don't fully understand
[1:16:37] it yet I don't understand every aspect
[1:16:40] but it's the truth something is bearing
[1:16:42] record within my heart that this man is
[1:16:46] not just an ordinary man this was not
[1:16:48] just another evangelist hallelujah amen
[1:16:52] this was was not just another preacher
[1:16:54] of healing no sir this was the word
[1:16:58] being released being manifested being
[1:17:02] given and being released to an to a to a
[1:17:05] an elected individual an elected body uh
[1:17:09] those who were predestinated from the
[1:17:11] foundations of the world oh now you're
[1:17:13] making yourself special Danny no I'm
[1:17:17] not I'd have been just as bad and just
[1:17:20] as terrible as anybody else out there
[1:17:24] living a life that's completely totally
[1:17:27] against God but God awoke the attribute
[1:17:31] it was placed there from before the
[1:17:32] foundations of the world there was
[1:17:34] nothing that I had to do with it I
[1:17:37] couldn't I couldn't put it on I couldn't
[1:17:39] try to put it you couldn't do any of it
[1:17:41] it's it's something that either you have
[1:17:43] it or you don't amen hallelujah it's as
[1:17:46] simple as that and when you have it you
[1:17:48] know it and and you rejoice because the
[1:17:52] word is is is is just like like
[1:17:54] fireworks constantly it burns within
[1:17:56] your heart you know it's the truth you
[1:17:59] know that you've come into the reality
[1:18:01] of Christ you know that it's just not
[1:18:03] another church Gathering you know that
[1:18:05] every time you come into the house of
[1:18:07] the Lord It's actually the Fulfillment
[1:18:09] of Ephesians chapter 4 where you are
[1:18:11] being edified by the word of God where
[1:18:14] you are being built up where you are
[1:18:15] being brought into the unity of the
[1:18:17] faith until you come into the fullness
[1:18:20] of your position in Christ Jesus amen
[1:18:23] praise God
[1:18:26] hallelujah you know a lot of churches
[1:18:28] they fall under
[1:18:30] that teaching of you know an
[1:18:33] understanding and you know and there's
[1:18:34] truth behind it it's the 8020 rule 20%
[1:18:38] of the people do 80% of the work in the
[1:18:40] church and so they try to give them a
[1:18:42] position and they try to say okay you
[1:18:44] know what you can be the Evangelist you
[1:18:46] can be this you can be that so that you
[1:18:49] know so that so that it's a title we
[1:18:51] don't we don't want titles
[1:18:53] we want the Holy Ghost amen we don't
[1:18:56] want a title we don't want to be you
[1:18:58] know exalted we don't want to be uh you
[1:19:00] know
[1:19:01] listen Pastor you know Pastor uh
[1:19:05] evangelist Apostle this and that those
[1:19:08] are titles and people will take them and
[1:19:10] and don't you know that I am a bishop
[1:19:13] don't you know that I am an apostle I am
[1:19:16] an apostle of this church and I have an
[1:19:18] authority in this region no what what is
[1:19:21] that
[1:19:23] that's man that's arrogance that's Pride
[1:19:28] that's not humility because every single
[1:19:32] office and you go back and you look at
[1:19:34] look at brother bram's Ministry you want
[1:19:36] to see humility you want to hear
[1:19:38] humility just listen to that man just
[1:19:42] watch and see that man's Ministry and
[1:19:44] and tell me that that was a man of
[1:19:46] arrogance that was not a man of
[1:19:48] arrogance that was a man of God Amen who
[1:19:52] knew that God God was there and and that
[1:19:54] he was accountable to God he learned
[1:19:56] some pretty hard lessons when he was
[1:19:59] just a man and when he was in his own
[1:20:01] thinking and his own ideas and would
[1:20:02] listen to other people meanwhile God had
[1:20:05] a calling upon his life and God has a
[1:20:07] calling upon your life amen and you have
[1:20:11] an important
[1:20:13] part you might think oh but I just clean
[1:20:17] the church that is just as
[1:20:21] important
[1:20:24] let's move on here I don't want to get
[1:20:26] too far along next slide so here now
[1:20:30] through these fivefold Ministry
[1:20:33] gifts therefore for
[1:20:36] perfecting and when you look at the word
[1:20:38] perfecting in Scripture it means
[1:20:41] equipping it means that it's it's it's
[1:20:43] to equip you it's to give you what you
[1:20:46] have need of in order to fulfill your
[1:20:49] part in the ministry you know a lot of
[1:20:53] people don't see and understand that but
[1:20:56] listen all you need to do is relax come
[1:20:59] under a Ministry sit and let the word of
[1:21:03] God have its effect on you you will
[1:21:06] start as you submit yourself humble
[1:21:09] yourself to the will of God God starts
[1:21:12] placing you you'll be unconscious of it
[1:21:15] all of a sudden you're behind the
[1:21:17] soundboard and you're not there just for
[1:21:19] one week or two weeks and then you're
[1:21:21] gone you're there you're consistently
[1:21:24] there you try to come in here on Sunday
[1:21:27] without anybody behind the
[1:21:29] soundboard it's going to change the
[1:21:31] whole
[1:21:32] thing you come in here and all of a
[1:21:35] sudden we got no piano
[1:21:37] player it changes the whole thing for
[1:21:39] the song leader you see all these
[1:21:42] aspects are Parts in the body of Christ
[1:21:44] that we don't realize but it's it's
[1:21:47] you're being equipped to actually be a
[1:21:50] part of the ministry so that that you
[1:21:52] can fulfill your part of the ministry
[1:21:56] and for the work of the ministry as it
[1:21:59] says
[1:22:00] equipping the ministry for the work of
[1:22:04] the
[1:22:04] ministry so that when you are equipped
[1:22:08] for the ministry you edify and bless the
[1:22:12] ministry amen you see God is giving us
[1:22:17] attributes God has given us God adds to
[1:22:19] the church such as should be saved on a
[1:22:21] regular basis
[1:22:23] because God is giving to this church and
[1:22:26] this is how I see it this is how I'm
[1:22:28] speaking it this is how I'm believing it
[1:22:31] that this church is going to grow that
[1:22:32] it's going to it's going to grow in in
[1:22:35] not just in numbers but in the quality
[1:22:38] of of the Sons and Daughters of God that
[1:22:40] are going to take their position and
[1:22:43] they are going to be blessed in that
[1:22:45] position let me tell you when you get
[1:22:47] into your rightful position in Christ
[1:22:50] you get blessed you get nourished you
[1:22:53] get the joint supplieth every need to
[1:22:57] itself you see so when when when when
[1:23:00] that individual that the piano player is
[1:23:03] there and she's doing her part and she's
[1:23:05] playing the the you know in the song
[1:23:07] service and I'm heing that piano and I'm
[1:23:10] I'm being blessed I'm being edified I'm
[1:23:12] being nourished by the office and by the
[1:23:15] gift that's being placed in there
[1:23:17] because now we're going to be looking at
[1:23:19] a lot of different gifts there isn't
[1:23:20] just these five gifts here these five
[1:23:23] gifts were given for the
[1:23:27] perfecting edifying bringing into Unity
[1:23:31] till we all come into the fullness of
[1:23:33] Christ but within those gifts are many
[1:23:37] other gifts that are there's about 20
[1:23:40] different gifts in the scriptures and
[1:23:42] we're going to be looking at them so
[1:23:44] that somewhere along this series you're
[1:23:47] going to hear something that's going to
[1:23:49] strike your soul you're going to know
[1:23:51] that that's me you're you're going to
[1:23:52] see your part in the word you're going
[1:23:54] to recognize that there it is hallelujah
[1:23:57] that's my name being called now I see
[1:23:59] you sat long enough you you waited you
[1:24:02] you stayed in your in your position
[1:24:05] whatever it is that you're doing now you
[1:24:06] were being consistent if you're just a
[1:24:08] consistent Church attender do that amen
[1:24:12] and do it
[1:24:14] consistently don't let me see you for a
[1:24:16] week or two weeks and then you disappear
[1:24:18] for three be consistent in what you're
[1:24:21] doing because that's where God is going
[1:24:24] to feed you and position you and give
[1:24:28] you the faith that you need in order to
[1:24:30] be the attribute that you are so that
[1:24:34] when rapturing faith when that
[1:24:36] revelation of the Rapture comes into the
[1:24:39] body and sweeps over the body and and
[1:24:42] perfect love sweeping over you you're
[1:24:45] going to be right there in your position
[1:24:47] and you're going to go boom just like
[1:24:49] that amen because it's a body move
[1:24:52] Hallelujah and you're a part of that
[1:24:55] body thank you Jesus amen
[1:25:00] so now let's go on so perfecting
[1:25:02] equipping the ministry for the work of
[1:25:05] the ministry so that the
[1:25:08] edify of the body of
[1:25:11] Christ so that we grow in the unity of
[1:25:15] the faith which is
[1:25:18] revelation remember anytime you see
[1:25:20] faith in the scripture it's Revelation
[1:25:23] we're coming into a unified
[1:25:27] Revelation praise God that can never
[1:25:32] be listen if you're if you're you're
[1:25:35] fighting with somebody on Revelation
[1:25:38] somebody's off or both of you
[1:25:41] are okay because it's it's you don't you
[1:25:46] don't argue on
[1:25:48] Revelation somebody comes in and says
[1:25:50] brother I got a revelation on this that
[1:25:53] this is going to happen this is how it's
[1:25:55] going to be and you know if you're if
[1:25:57] you're if you're just you know a sheep
[1:26:00] right first of all if you're a sheep
[1:26:03] you're you're putting everything in its
[1:26:04] proper perspective and you're you're
[1:26:06] looking to your Shepherd you're
[1:26:08] understanding that God has a way of
[1:26:11] bringing forth his word in season so
[1:26:14] that you can receive what you have need
[1:26:16] of and a sheep is not a goat it's a
[1:26:21] sheep
[1:26:23] so when when somebody comes to you and
[1:26:26] starts to you know try to give you
[1:26:28] something that you know they got a
[1:26:29] revelation on this or they understand it
[1:26:32] this way or that way just be still say
[1:26:35] oh well praise God brother you know I
[1:26:38] don't quite see it clearly that way yet
[1:26:41] but man praise the Lord I'm just going
[1:26:43] to wait on the Lord I'm just going to
[1:26:46] let the Holy Spirit reveal it to me when
[1:26:49] it comes and then when it comes I you
[1:26:52] you know I I believe because I I'm I'm
[1:26:55] I'm I'm just letting him give me
[1:26:57] Revelation and you know so far I just I
[1:27:00] just love the Lord I love serving his
[1:27:02] people I just you know you know somebody
[1:27:04] will come to you with a report on
[1:27:07] somebody be
[1:27:09] careful be careful of those reports they
[1:27:13] start out as very innocent reports and
[1:27:16] before you know it it's gossip and it's
[1:27:18] a bad report and it's not a good thing
[1:27:22] to listen in on those things and accept
[1:27:24] those things because you're actually
[1:27:26] taking on a spirit you got to be careful
[1:27:29] of that and so when that say oh brother
[1:27:32] or sister have you talked to them about
[1:27:34] it I certainly don't see where I fit in
[1:27:38] here unless you're a deacon you're a
[1:27:41] pastor or somebody that that you know of
[1:27:44] authority that that's been that's been
[1:27:45] given the anointing and the position to
[1:27:48] deal with that thing then you leave it
[1:27:51] alone or you got guide them to their
[1:27:53] Pastor or their Deacon you see these are
[1:27:56] little simple things but this is all
[1:27:58] part of coming into the unity of the
[1:28:01] faith a lot of people don't don't see
[1:28:04] those simple things and that's why
[1:28:06] they'll go from one Church to the other
[1:28:08] Church to the next church because they
[1:28:10] don't want to come under
[1:28:12] subjection to the leadership of that
[1:28:14] church now I'm not saying every church
[1:28:16] is correct I'm not saying you know
[1:28:19] there's a false five-fold
[1:28:21] Ministry
[1:28:22] absolutely there's a true one and
[1:28:24] there's a false one there's dark there's
[1:28:27] there's light okay so you've got to but
[1:28:30] you got to know God's got to give you a
[1:28:33] personal revelation on where God is
[1:28:36] giving you faith and where God is giving
[1:28:38] you the understanding amen praise God
[1:28:40] hallelujah let's look at the next slide
[1:28:42] brother Brown speaking here in the
[1:28:45] message of Grace he says now but then
[1:28:48] there's five offices first is apostles
[1:28:52] prophets teachers evangelists and
[1:28:56] pastors that's ordained offices of God
[1:29:01] that's not an office that somebody gets
[1:29:04] elected to by the by by the pastor
[1:29:08] himself the pastor just doesn't turn
[1:29:10] around and say oh I'll make you an
[1:29:12] evangelist no what'll happen is there
[1:29:16] will be a gift around that individual
[1:29:20] and you'll notice them being invited to
[1:29:23] go out to minister to other churches the
[1:29:26] invitations open and you make yourself
[1:29:29] available and all of a sudden it starts
[1:29:31] to interpret itself and it starts to
[1:29:34] become real and all of a sudden God is
[1:29:38] showing that that individual has the
[1:29:41] gift of an
[1:29:44] evangelist like we want to keep it
[1:29:46] simple amen God ordains these offices
[1:29:51] men hold them see they no you can't wish
[1:29:55] for them you can't pray for them you're
[1:29:59] sovereignly given your born Hallelujah
[1:30:05] you're born a prophet is not a prophet
[1:30:08] if somebody lays hands on him and makes
[1:30:10] him a prophet a prophet's born from his
[1:30:13] mother's womb is a prophet see so he's
[1:30:17] always a prophet see God told Jeremiah
[1:30:22] said before you were even conceived in
[1:30:24] your mother's womb said I knowed you and
[1:30:28] Sanctified you and ordained you a
[1:30:31] prophet to the Nations that's right see
[1:30:34] Moses before he was born he was a proper
[1:30:37] child he was the prophet of the Lord all
[1:30:40] the rest of them coming forth Christ was
[1:30:43] the son of God from the Garden of Eden
[1:30:46] that's right see gifts and callings are
[1:30:49] without repentance but gifts are given
[1:30:52] to the body now we recognize that we
[1:30:56] recognize all these gifts God gives the
[1:31:00] gifts to the
[1:31:01] body you see when when like you know i'
[1:31:05] you know brother brother Danny why you
[1:31:07] preaching on this because we need to we
[1:31:10] need to understand the foundation of how
[1:31:14] you get into your position how it is
[1:31:17] that God places you into your position
[1:31:20] how it is that God gifts you you know
[1:31:23] like a singer for example when somebody
[1:31:26] has a voice to sing and to sing and then
[1:31:29] they surrender their life to the Lord
[1:31:31] you know how many voices are out there
[1:31:34] there's there's amazing singers out
[1:31:37] there look at Whitney Houston she
[1:31:39] started singing in church that's where
[1:31:42] she started to sing and became
[1:31:45] recognized for the beautiful voice that
[1:31:47] she
[1:31:50] had but then
[1:31:53] Hollywood got a hold of that
[1:31:55] voice and before you know it it was
[1:31:58] breaking records breaking uh you know
[1:32:02] hitting the top of the charts her her
[1:32:05] publicity went from zero to a million
[1:32:09] you know all of a sudden she was known
[1:32:11] throughout the world and she has a gift
[1:32:13] she had a gifted voice it was an amazing
[1:32:17] voice but it was not used for the glory
[1:32:20] of God amen and it therefore did not
[1:32:24] edify the true body of Jesus Christ but
[1:32:28] then there's going to be those gifts
[1:32:30] that God is just going to bring them in
[1:32:33] and then all of a sudden they're going
[1:32:34] to sing a song and while they're singing
[1:32:37] that song and you know maybe you're
[1:32:38] reading your Bible or you're thinking on
[1:32:40] something else and all of a sudden boom
[1:32:42] something strikes your soul and that
[1:32:45] song and that gift is blessing you and
[1:32:48] you're feeling blessed and you're you're
[1:32:50] you're receiving faith and encouragement
[1:32:54] and you're and you're you're just you're
[1:32:55] just rejoicing because every word that's
[1:32:58] being spoken is speaking to your heart
[1:33:00] speaking to your life meets a need for
[1:33:03] you that's a gift within the body of
[1:33:05] Christ and that gift is not for you it's
[1:33:10] for
[1:33:10] me it's for us yes it's it's so that it
[1:33:14] can be given to to for the glory of God
[1:33:17] so that the body of Christ can can be
[1:33:19] edified and built up as a result of it
[1:33:23] amen hallelujah praise God and so the
[1:33:27] next slide and then there's five minial
[1:33:30] offices how many believes that now these
[1:33:32] are ministerial offices brother braham's
[1:33:34] talking about this five-fold ministry
[1:33:37] because it's given to the church in
[1:33:39] order to to to bring all those aspects
[1:33:42] together so that we can come into the
[1:33:43] unity of the faith but God gives it I'm
[1:33:46] I'm I'm emphasizing that it's God that
[1:33:49] places the gifts it's God that anoints
[1:33:52] the individual it's God that gives the
[1:33:54] ability it's God's character in the
[1:33:56] individual it's God designing you from
[1:34:00] from growing up from from when you were
[1:34:02] a kid God designed you in a certain way
[1:34:05] so that that gift at the time that he
[1:34:08] wanted to place it into the body of
[1:34:10] Christ it could be ready and it could be
[1:34:13] used and it could be mature and it could
[1:34:15] have the right kind of character behind
[1:34:17] it sometimes people got great gifts got
[1:34:21] gifts of Prophecy Gifts of Revelation
[1:34:23] Gifts of but they don't have the right
[1:34:26] character and God still has to move and
[1:34:28] mold and shape the character so that the
[1:34:31] gift can be can be ministered in love in
[1:34:36] in a in in the right way so that the
[1:34:38] body can receive it you know it's
[1:34:41] everything works in such a way and God
[1:34:43] is not the author of confusion and
[1:34:46] that's why when when when it's truly of
[1:34:49] God that that he's that he's be behind
[1:34:51] that gift it will meet a need within the
[1:34:56] body of Christ it will feed you it will
[1:34:59] edify you you'll be nourished by the by
[1:35:02] the by The Joint that that individual is
[1:35:05] amen praise God so he says your five
[1:35:08] ministerial gifts how many believes that
[1:35:10] sure and that's first apostles prophets
[1:35:12] teachers pastors evangelist how many
[1:35:14] knows that now how can you say there's a
[1:35:17] pastor or evangelist without saying
[1:35:19] there's a prophet how can you say
[1:35:21] there's a prophet when there isn't an
[1:35:24] apostle see some people like to say oh
[1:35:27] there's pastors and evangelists and
[1:35:29] teachers but they don't want to say
[1:35:33] prophets you see they're they're they're
[1:35:36] you know a lot of people don't
[1:35:38] understand listen the apostles doctrines
[1:35:41] that are written all throughout the New
[1:35:43] Testament from the Apostle Paul all the
[1:35:46] way down through Peter James every one
[1:35:49] of them every the book of Acts all all
[1:35:52] the doctrine that we need is all
[1:35:56] there there's no new doctrine so
[1:36:00] remember that that's why the scripture
[1:36:02] said in Ephesians chapter 2 there verse
[1:36:04] 20 to 22 that it's built upon the the
[1:36:08] apostles and the prophets and Jesus
[1:36:10] Christ being the Chief Cornerstone here
[1:36:13] we need to see that that aspect can
[1:36:16] never change the apostles Doctrine the
[1:36:19] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:36:21] that was a doctrine of the Apostles that
[1:36:24] was written into the old into the New
[1:36:26] Testament that can never change that is
[1:36:29] the foundational teaching and God will
[1:36:32] not be the author of confusion and tell
[1:36:34] you it's okay you can be baptized into
[1:36:36] titles you can you might as well be
[1:36:38] baptized into into the name of the Rosa
[1:36:40] Sharon because it also describes Christ
[1:36:43] the lily of the valley why aren't you
[1:36:45] being baptized in the lily of the valley
[1:36:47] I baptize you why why doesn't that work
[1:36:51] because that's not the way the apostles
[1:36:54] laid in the doctrines and the
[1:36:56] foundations and the teachings of the
[1:36:58] original church that can never change
[1:37:02] never so when somebody tells you oh yeah
[1:37:05] oh well yeah we believe in the five-fold
[1:37:06] ministry oh praise God then but you know
[1:37:10] God is a
[1:37:12] trinity and when we baptize we baptized
[1:37:15] as adults and it doesn't matter how
[1:37:17] you're baptized as long as you go into
[1:37:18] the water you can even be sprinkled over
[1:37:20] your head
[1:37:23] that is not the word of God it's as
[1:37:26] simple as that you you can't build
[1:37:30] anything upon
[1:37:32] that that's why the foundations of the
[1:37:35] Apostles and then having God send us a
[1:37:38] prophet in the 20th century with a word
[1:37:42] for our day listen God
[1:37:46] sent
[1:37:48] uh who's the one Jonah brother Corey
[1:37:51] preached on Jonah there ministered on
[1:37:54] Jonah on Friday night prayer meeting and
[1:37:56] how Jonah was trying to run from his
[1:37:59] calling but let me tell you something
[1:38:02] God got him into his position he went to
[1:38:05] Nineveh he did what he was supposed to
[1:38:07] do and he converted the whole city okay
[1:38:11] because God's ways are not our ways but
[1:38:16] Jonah was the prophet for that
[1:38:19] day just like Moses was the one that God
[1:38:22] sent into pharaoh to say set my people
[1:38:26] free that was the prophet of that day
[1:38:30] Elijah when he came and he went up and
[1:38:32] he says not even do is going to fall
[1:38:34] until I call for it that was that day
[1:38:39] God sent us into all this confusion of
[1:38:45] Christianity because over the last 2,000
[1:38:47] years the church has got completely into
[1:38:51] utter total confusion you've got two
[1:38:54] three four thousand different
[1:38:56] denominations and teachings on
[1:38:58] Christianity which one do you believe
[1:39:01] how do you know which one is the truth
[1:39:03] well what makes you think yours is the
[1:39:04] truth I'm not saying that it's the truth
[1:39:07] I'm just telling you to look and search
[1:39:09] for yourself so that you can be
[1:39:11] satisfied with the truth that you have
[1:39:14] because your salvation relies on that
[1:39:17] don't put it on me you don't have to
[1:39:20] listen to me if you're to this church
[1:39:22] only because oh well you know brother
[1:39:24] Danny's a good businessman and you know
[1:39:25] what I think I'll go to his church
[1:39:27] because you know I know him and you know
[1:39:30] uh I'll just follow him
[1:39:32] wrong that's not the way it works you're
[1:39:36] not following a man you're not following
[1:39:38] a teaching you're not following
[1:39:40] somebody's Doctrine you're following
[1:39:43] Christ the word the present stage of his
[1:39:46] ministry the Living God a
[1:39:49] supernatural listen this body
[1:39:53] edification if we start looking in we're
[1:39:55] going to be looking into some of the
[1:39:56] Greek words effectual you look at some
[1:39:59] of the Greek words that are being used
[1:40:02] in in these scriptures you're going to
[1:40:04] see that there's meanings behind them
[1:40:06] that that that you might not clearly
[1:40:08] understand but when you go back to the
[1:40:09] original Greek it means miraculous
[1:40:13] Miracles Supernatural there's going to
[1:40:16] be Supernatural elements in a true birth
[1:40:20] you are not want to be just left to some
[1:40:23] uh you know teaching of man you might
[1:40:25] come into the church here and you might
[1:40:27] get excited about what you're hearing
[1:40:29] and then you'll research you say oh boy
[1:40:31] this really did happen listen to this
[1:40:33] Prophet he's talking to this woman and
[1:40:35] he's telling her where where where she
[1:40:37] lived what city she came from man that's
[1:40:39] incredible that's amazing you know
[1:40:41] brother brandham would do certain things
[1:40:43] but that's not enough that's not going
[1:40:45] to be enough for you to actually be in
[1:40:48] the Rapture and to identify yourself in
[1:40:50] the mystical body the supernatural body
[1:40:53] of Jesus Christ that's going to go into
[1:40:55] Rapture when the Rapture happens I'll
[1:40:58] tell you right now 95% of the world out
[1:41:01] there is going to miss it they're not
[1:41:03] going to recognize it they're not going
[1:41:04] to know that it actually
[1:41:06] happened some of the ones that know you
[1:41:09] that you were talking about it and it
[1:41:10] takes place and how
[1:41:14] come boy Sharon didn't show up to work
[1:41:18] what's going
[1:41:19] on you know all all of a sudden you know
[1:41:23] Jack he he just where's he been for the
[1:41:26] last two weeks you know what's going on
[1:41:29] you know that's how small a group this
[1:41:32] is but that's you know how peculiar we
[1:41:36] are and we don't want to be peculiar
[1:41:39] we're not trying to be peculiar but it's
[1:41:42] what's been revealed to us it's the
[1:41:44] reality of Christ in our lives amen and
[1:41:47] it's a supernatural element and that
[1:41:50] needs to be in your experience you will
[1:41:53] know that you know Hallelujah now he
[1:41:58] says oh there's pastors some people say
[1:42:01] like like to say oh there's pastors and
[1:42:03] evangelists and teachers but they don't
[1:42:05] want to say prophets the same God said
[1:42:08] teachers and evangelists said prophets
[1:42:10] he keeps his word we don't pan knife it
[1:42:14] we just preach it that's what it is
[1:42:17] God's up it's up to God to take care of
[1:42:20] his own word do you believe
[1:42:23] that amen praise God forever more
[1:42:28] Allelujah so we know that these
[1:42:33] callings it's not of man it's all of God
[1:42:38] Amen and if God does
[1:42:41] it you're going to be a supernatural
[1:42:46] element within the
[1:42:48] church you're going to do things now
[1:42:51] don't be getting me wrong here and
[1:42:52] saying Supernatural what do you mean Dan
[1:42:54] you know like what's going to no the
[1:42:56] supernatural happens so often around the
[1:42:59] Sons and Daughters of God that it starts
[1:43:02] to become
[1:43:04] almost
[1:43:07] natural oh this happened I I was doing
[1:43:10] things this week and you know like
[1:43:12] certain things that that that happened
[1:43:13] like the simplest little things you know
[1:43:16] when I I went to go do something and I
[1:43:18] needed something to happen and uh and
[1:43:20] all of a sudden boom it just happened
[1:43:22] right there and I thought wow thank you
[1:43:25] Lord praise God you know I I I you know
[1:43:29] I was I was really not expecting that to
[1:43:31] happen but it just it does you see
[1:43:33] because we're human we're still human so
[1:43:37] don't don't make yourself anything more
[1:43:39] than a human but understand that there's
[1:43:41] an attribute of God in you there's a
[1:43:43] there's a purpose of God in you that
[1:43:46] purpose of God must find its place must
[1:43:50] get into its position it's it's its
[1:43:53] desire is the word of God it can only
[1:43:56] feed on the word of God it's going to
[1:43:58] feed on it into eternity it'll never
[1:44:00] stop feeding on the revelation of God's
[1:44:03] word don't you think sometimes like man
[1:44:06] what are we going to do all day long you
[1:44:08] know when we when we go into eternity it
[1:44:10] ain't going to be all day long it's
[1:44:13] going to be
[1:44:14] Eternal there ain't going to be a
[1:44:16] yesterday and a and a and a tomorrow
[1:44:19] it's just going to be now
[1:44:21] so right now I want to go and and take a
[1:44:24] trip through
[1:44:25] Europe on a
[1:44:27] nice
[1:44:29] boat with some of the Brethren and have
[1:44:31] some fellowship for six
[1:44:33] months in your mind it's six months
[1:44:36] because whatever there there's not going
[1:44:38] to be time or space and you're going to
[1:44:42] be feeding on the Eternal thoughts of
[1:44:44] God this all goes back you know this is
[1:44:47] the this is the Paradox now okay I'm
[1:44:49] going to hit you with a paradox
[1:44:52] the Paradox is this we're here on this
[1:44:55] Earth we've seen history for 6,000 years
[1:44:59] based on the Bible we know there's
[1:45:00] history that goes back hundreds of
[1:45:02] thousands of years maybe millions of
[1:45:04] years trillion years
[1:45:07] whatever we're here on this earth right
[1:45:10] now brother Brian you got to go to work
[1:45:12] tomorrow morning
[1:45:15] yeah a lot of us got to go to work
[1:45:17] tomorrow morning right now we got to
[1:45:21] bills then we got to deal with family
[1:45:24] issues this one is is is is causing a
[1:45:28] Havoc over here and then we got the boss
[1:45:31] to deal with and then we've got this
[1:45:32] flesh to deal with and this pain and
[1:45:35] that pain and all those you know this is
[1:45:37] all part of your human existence but the
[1:45:40] Paradox is that you are a son or
[1:45:42] daughter of God and that you are
[1:45:44] Eternal and that you are only in this
[1:45:48] world but you're not of this world
[1:45:51] amen you're not the person that you look
[1:45:54] at in the mirror you're the person that
[1:45:55] you look at in the word you need to see
[1:45:59] yourself in the word if all you're
[1:46:01] seeing is that person in the mirror then
[1:46:03] you're looking at the wrinkles then
[1:46:04] you're looking at oh my gosh then you're
[1:46:06] looking at this and you're looking at
[1:46:08] that and you're saying oh my goodness
[1:46:10] this and that I got to do this I got to
[1:46:12] do that but if you look at the Paradox
[1:46:14] which is that you are a son of God an
[1:46:17] attribute of God then all that just
[1:46:21] starts to fade
[1:46:23] away and here we are in the plan of God
[1:46:26] and we need to fulfill this part of the
[1:46:28] plan brother Desmond you're going to
[1:46:31] Africa next week you got to deal with
[1:46:33] that plane for so many hours that
[1:46:36] uncomfortable chair all those aspects
[1:46:39] that you got to deal with oh boy you're
[1:46:42] never going to get my wife on a 2our
[1:46:46] flight but this is the paradox of being
[1:46:51] a human being and dealing with this
[1:46:53] world and this life but then you're a
[1:46:55] Son of God then you that that that that
[1:46:59] what you shared with us this morning on
[1:47:01] that that wonderful experience that you
[1:47:03] had in the Lord and and in and and you
[1:47:06] you you you heard singing like you never
[1:47:08] heard before that's the reality that's
[1:47:11] the reality of who you really are but
[1:47:13] you've got to play out your part and
[1:47:16] find your position in the word a lot of
[1:47:20] people people you know when when you get
[1:47:22] to talking like this and I'm just
[1:47:23] talking to you I'm just talking to you
[1:47:24] like like you know this is life this is
[1:47:26] how it is you know you you you know this
[1:47:29] is you know if if you knew that next
[1:47:32] week the Rapture was going to happen you
[1:47:35] knew for sure God sends an angel down to
[1:47:38] meet and says prepare you're going in a
[1:47:41] week or God shows you that it's your
[1:47:44] time to go what would you do how would
[1:47:46] you live how who would you what would
[1:47:49] you say to people
[1:47:52] because that's the Paradox Saints in One
[1:47:55] Moment In One twinkling of an eye one
[1:47:58] day we're all going to be changed and
[1:48:00] we're going to be taken out of this
[1:48:01] Dimension and there's nothing that is
[1:48:04] going to change that nothing that you
[1:48:06] can do to change that amen let's wind it
[1:48:10] down let's go to the next slide God has
[1:48:13] sent in the church five different gifts
[1:48:16] Apostles prophets teachers evangelists
[1:48:19] pastors those are for the perfecting of
[1:48:23] the
[1:48:25] church that is his proof his ministering
[1:48:29] Spirit to the church to bring the body
[1:48:32] of Christ together now go to the next
[1:48:37] slide actually I want to read
[1:48:39] something before we go to
[1:48:43] this brother brandham speaking here in
[1:48:46] questions and
[1:48:48] answers in uh
[1:48:54] 1964 so he he gets the question here
[1:48:57] dearly below about the scripture of
[1:48:59] Ephesians 4:11 through do we all do we
[1:49:04] get all the perfecting of the Saints
[1:49:07] through the
[1:49:08] tapes or should we be
[1:49:12] here where the gifts of the Spirit are
[1:49:15] operating and the different offices of
[1:49:17] the church to help Pro protect us our
[1:49:22] hearts have believed all the word of the
[1:49:24] Lord this was the person's
[1:49:27] question brother brandham goes on and
[1:49:31] says so so the question is do we uh uh
[1:49:36] do we all do we all get all our
[1:49:38] perfecting of the Saints through the
[1:49:40] tapes brother Bram says no they want to
[1:49:45] come here to the church for the
[1:49:49] perfecting okay they want to come here
[1:49:52] see that's where we get Fellowship one
[1:49:55] with another here in the church see he's
[1:49:58] talking about that
[1:50:00] Fellowship that is in the Holy Ghost
[1:50:02] that is in a body that is under
[1:50:05] subjection to the five-fold ministry to
[1:50:08] the true five-fold Ministry they're
[1:50:11] under a real Pastor they're under and
[1:50:14] and within that church there's
[1:50:15] missionaries there's evangelists there's
[1:50:18] there's uh uh prophetic gifts there's
[1:50:20] teachers right within that Ministry that
[1:50:22] are operating and they are in there
[1:50:25] fellowshipping one with the other and
[1:50:28] it's there and through the simple little
[1:50:30] gifts of of you know Gifts of of
[1:50:33] discernment gifts of of uh um uh
[1:50:38] prophecy Gifts of uh helps within the
[1:50:41] church you know we've got some some
[1:50:43] incredible helps within this church we
[1:50:46] want to thank God for these helps that
[1:50:47] have that are that are that are just
[1:50:50] raising up they're not being oh told you
[1:50:52] got to do this or you got to do listen
[1:50:54] when you you want to see the definition
[1:50:57] of real Supernatural placing within the
[1:51:00] ministry just look and watch closely pay
[1:51:03] attention around you look at the things
[1:51:05] that are happening around you notice how
[1:51:07] certain things are being done how
[1:51:09] certain things are getting taken care of
[1:51:11] you're not even aware of it you're not
[1:51:12] even being told about it that it's not
[1:51:15] something hey I'm doing this hey I'm
[1:51:17] doing that that's not that's not a true
[1:51:19] gift a real gift it moves in a
[1:51:22] supernatural quiet way and it just
[1:51:25] edifies it just blesses it just
[1:51:27] encourages and that's what God is doing
[1:51:30] that's how he's doing it that's how he's
[1:51:32] building and how we want this church to
[1:51:35] be built we want this kind of Revelation
[1:51:38] coming on the people so that they can
[1:51:41] move and manifest by Revelation
[1:51:44] themselves seeing it like if your heart
[1:51:46] is not burning within you when you're
[1:51:48] hearing what I'm saying here then you're
[1:51:50] missing something you're you're you're
[1:51:52] just oh he wants to just he just wants
[1:51:54] everybody to work or he just wants
[1:51:56] everybody to to to to give or he just
[1:51:58] wants no that's a gift giving is a gift
[1:52:01] too did you know that I could show you
[1:52:03] through the
[1:52:03] scripture it's a gift God has anointed
[1:52:07] some individuals to be givers to support
[1:52:10] the body of Christ and that is a gift
[1:52:13] and that is not a gift that that's in
[1:52:15] the open it's not one that you see it's
[1:52:16] not one that's behind the pulpit talking
[1:52:18] to you every week you know it's because
[1:52:21] that's the mouth but you try and and
[1:52:24] remove you know just remove your liver
[1:52:27] say here go to the hospital say here
[1:52:29] take my liver you know I don't really
[1:52:31] see it I don't know what it's doing you
[1:52:33] know I I don't pay attention to it you
[1:52:35] know so you might as well have it yeah
[1:52:38] you won't last an hour you're as good as
[1:52:41] a dead man and a church that doesn't
[1:52:44] have all these hidden parts that are
[1:52:47] working in the background by revelation
[1:52:49] doing their part helping to to edify and
[1:52:53] strengthen and build the church without
[1:52:55] that the church starts to slip away this
[1:52:58] is not my church this is not your church
[1:53:02] this is the Church of God this is the
[1:53:05] body of Jesus Christ until you come into
[1:53:08] that Revelation that that's where you're
[1:53:10] going to fit and edify and build and and
[1:53:13] nourish and be a part of this church and
[1:53:15] and be blessed as a result of it you
[1:53:18] will automatically receive receive the
[1:53:20] blessings that come into this ministry
[1:53:23] whatever blessings God is going to pour
[1:53:25] into this ministry if you're a part of
[1:53:27] it you are just as equally going to
[1:53:30] receive your portion just like the
[1:53:32] pastor just like the deacons just like
[1:53:34] the trustees just like anybody else you
[1:53:37] will receive your blessing you will be
[1:53:40] encouraged you will be strengthened you
[1:53:42] will be encouraged by the word of God
[1:53:44] and you will not be doing it because you
[1:53:46] have to do it you'll be doing it because
[1:53:49] God called called you God gifted you God
[1:53:51] anointed you there's a big difference
[1:53:55] amen hallelujah praise God so he says we

[2:06:00] that happens it's happened to every

[2:06:05] life okay but God knows and if you have
[2:06:09] the right attitude towards that you can
[2:06:12] receive just as much the blessing being
[2:06:14] there having paid or not paid it's
[2:06:17] irrelevant we're happy to see you and
