[5:01] thank you all appreciate it very much
[5:04] thank you brothers
[5:08] good to have you here in the house of
[5:09] the lord and i want to first of all
[5:12] thank god for all the brethren that came
[5:15] here
[5:17] during the past week and yesterday
[5:21] to have all of the equipment set up
[5:25] because they're going to try for the
[5:27] first time to stream
[5:29] the entire service live
[5:32] onto youtube we don't know what problems
[5:36] we may have
[5:38] or anything of that nature but as you
[5:40] know it's
[5:41] the first time we're doing everything in
[5:43] this way
[5:44] and not the preaching but you know the
[5:47] first time we're
[5:48] going digital online like that live
[5:52] praise god not um that it's um
[5:56] it's recorded and then put up but it's
[5:59] actually going on live while we're
[6:02] speaking
[6:03] so they had to buy equipment and set
[6:06] things up
[6:07] and test and try and everything else
[6:10] before
[6:10] it could be in a position to do that so
[6:13] we want to thank
[6:14] all of those of you who cooperated with
[6:17] that
[6:18] and the worshipers the singers and all
[6:21] of that
[6:22] praise god so welcome to all of you back
[6:25] in the house of the lord
[6:32] amen so i thank god for every one of you
[6:35] i
[6:35] also want to ask those that were
[6:39] newly baptized during the time
[6:43] the church was closed baptisms went on
[6:47] so i'd ask you to stand wherever you are
[6:49] if you are baptized in water
[6:52] praise god praise god praise god
[6:56] praise the lord let's give them a hand
[7:02] amen the lord bless you real god please
[7:05] be seated
[7:06] just to let you know that baptism
[7:09] is a sign uh from god
[7:12] that just as much as we were
[7:16] jesus was buried and wrote
[7:19] to walk in his glorified
[7:22] life even so the symbol of going into
[7:27] the water
[7:27] is as if you were being buried
[7:31] spiritually you passed
[7:33] all the mistakes all your wrongs
[7:37] buried praise the lord and now
[7:40] you've been raised up to walk in newness
[7:43] of life
[7:44] to walk in the new life which is the
[7:47] life
[7:47] of jesus christ so may god bless you
[7:51] straighten you and guide you
[7:54] in the rest of your life's journey
[7:57] we will talk about this at another time
[8:00] we thank god for that i want to also
[8:04] uh speak upon the new protocols that we
[8:07] have to partake of
[8:10] and i'm wearing this for now i've
[8:12] already uh sent to try and get um
[8:16] a clear visor where i can speak
[8:19] much better uh you know it's made for
[8:22] for that type of thing where you can
[8:24] speak better but your face would be
[8:26] clearly seen
[8:28] but for now i have to use this blue
[8:31] one that i have here now so if you see
[8:33] me adjusting it from time to time
[8:36] you'll understand but
[8:40] so we have as you see the church is all
[8:42] marked out
[8:43] it's all distanced properly and
[8:47] uh let's stay with the protocols
[8:50] that we have here and the reasoning is
[8:53] very important
[8:55] because you may not know this but the
[8:57] last the
[8:58] the last service that we had here we
[9:01] actually had the police come and
[9:04] was counting how many people were in to
[9:06] see if we were at the right number
[9:08] and checking to see when you go in the
[9:11] parking lot
[9:12] whether or not we were trying to at
[9:14] least keep
[9:16] some distance you were checking and all
[9:19] that
[9:20] and you had people from around here
[9:24] going online and making all kinds of
[9:27] remarks
[9:29] and actually saying i am crazy the
[9:32] leadership is crazy to have people
[9:34] coming
[9:35] and having church and all this type of
[9:37] things
[9:38] and and actually they're the ones called
[9:40] the police
[9:42] and the police came and checked and they
[9:43] found nothing
[9:45] right because we already had you know
[9:47] we're
[9:48] telling people to distance themselves
[9:51] properly
[9:52] so they found nothing and that's what
[9:53] they said
[9:55] but it gave me at least that let me know
[9:59] that eyes are upon us
[10:02] you may not be seeing them or anything
[10:05] like that but
[10:06] eyes are upon us so it's very important
[10:10] that we stay with these
[10:12] directives and protocols that we are
[10:15] receiving and i think they're a little
[10:18] more
[10:19] strict on it because the government uses
[10:22] the four years there
[10:24] as a voting um they use it as an
[10:27] area for voting and other
[10:31] municipal or government things they will
[10:34] ask to use that
[10:35] so if we don't keep those
[10:39] protocols then they won't be encouraged
[10:41] to continue
[10:42] praise the lord so let's do our best in
[10:45] that
[10:46] particular area uh during the
[10:50] the months uh actually it's such a long
[10:52] time from
[10:53] march my goodness
[10:56] oh man praise god some of the
[11:00] kids are now young people
[11:04] they've grown up in such a short while
[11:08] but i during that period of time
[11:12] brother mike and his family were very
[11:15] very
[11:16] helpful and to myself and sister simon
[11:19] they actually came by and went to costco
[11:23] or went out to the store and did a lot
[11:26] of our buying and stuff
[11:28] you know until things began to ease up
[11:30] before sister simon would
[11:32] venture out and you know do some
[11:35] shopping and stuff like that but before
[11:37] that
[11:38] it was brother mike and his family that
[11:40] were doing that for us so i want to
[11:42] thank god for them
[11:49] also brother philip over here
[11:53] and his family brother philip in
[11:55] particular was very
[11:56] useful also in that area to run any
[12:00] errand or to do anything
[12:02] listen all of you are not living close
[12:05] enough by me to be able to do that i
[12:07] know that if you were there
[12:09] you would be willing to do it so it's
[12:11] not like i'm just singling them out
[12:13] i understand that but because they are
[12:16] closer
[12:17] they were able to be useful to me
[12:20] in that and my family in that particular
[12:23] way
[12:24] also brother alvin was also another
[12:28] person that was
[12:29] very very useful and i want to thank god
[12:32] for brother alvin and his family
[12:36] that were a real blessing to us
[12:39] thank god uh sister pat and
[12:42] and uh stanley also we want to thank god
[12:45] for them
[12:47] amen god bless them and keep them
[12:50] and keep him especially in health
[12:53] because he's been having some health
[12:54] challenges
[12:57] sister merle that is sister julie's
[13:01] mother wrote me to
[13:04] in rejoicing how that her husband who
[13:07] was not a believer of the message
[13:09] um god touched his heart you know
[13:13] he went into the hospital and while in
[13:16] there before he came out
[13:18] he became like a believer and so
[13:21] now they're going to church regularly
[13:25] and she is happy and rejoicing is for
[13:27] years and years
[13:31] praise god that she's been asking god
[13:35] for this
[13:36] and god has honored her praise the lord
[13:40] praise god now if i didn't uh refer to
[13:44] or say any and everything i should say
[13:47] uh today
[13:48] then um we'll have to pick that up
[13:51] another time and you
[13:52] i trust that you'll forgive me um and
[13:55] today we will go into
[13:57] the word of god and speak to you for a
[14:01] little while
[14:02] amen my
[14:05] uh my topic for today
[14:08] is going to come from judges chapter 21
[14:12] verse 25
[14:14] and you may find that in your bible
[14:21] and shall we rise and read this together
[14:26] and it's just verse
[14:31] praise god hallelujah
[14:35] in those days there
[14:38] was no king in israel
[14:43] every man did that which was
[14:46] right in his own eyes
[14:50] i'd like to read that again in
[14:54] those days there was no
[14:57] king in israel every man
[15:00] did that which was right
[15:04] in his own eyes
[15:07] may god bless the reading of his word
[15:10] our gracious heavenly
[15:12] father we ask your blessing
[15:15] upon the reading of your word
[15:18] now we would pray that you will
[15:21] break the bread of life to us
[15:24] and make it be fresh manna from heaven
[15:30] grant us angels food today lord
[15:34] but that by it we may live
[15:37] and be able to finish
[15:40] our life's journey for your glory and
[15:42] honor amen
[15:44] amen god bless you please be seated
[15:50] now as you know one of the last
[15:54] messages that was brought
[15:58] the tabernacle here was talking about
[16:01] the provocation
[16:02] in the wilderness and we talked about
[16:05] how the israelites
[16:08] led by the great pillar of fire
[16:12] going through the wilderness and how
[16:15] that some of them began to provoke god
[16:19] and they provoked him by
[16:22] questioning his ability they forgot
[16:26] his miracles that he had performed
[16:30] in the wilderness some
[16:33] murmured some complained
[16:37] some complained against god some
[16:41] murmured and complained against moses
[16:44] and the bible tells us most of
[16:47] all brothers that they doubted his
[16:51] power and his ability to keep
[16:54] them protect them and to bring them
[16:57] through the wilderness and so
[17:01] only two joshua and caleb
[17:06] that we know the bible spoke speaks of
[17:09] that really stood by the word of god
[17:12] and did not slow up did not
[17:16] back up did not bow or anything
[17:21] because they believed god's word
[17:23] completely
[17:25] because if he said i'm going to take you
[17:27] out of egypt
[17:29] i'm going to bring you to the wilderness
[17:31] i'm going to bring you into the promised
[17:33] land
[17:34] then he has to do that it's not for me
[17:38] to figure out
[17:39] how am i going to come out of this heat
[17:42] how am i going to come out of all of
[17:43] these snakes
[17:44] how am i going to come through all of
[17:46] the bitter waters of mara
[17:49] how am i going to be able to come
[17:51] through all this suffering
[17:53] that's not her our problem is he
[17:57] said he's going to bring us through
[18:00] and he promised that he has a place
[18:02] prepared for us
[18:06] that we should be ready to go there
[18:09] so just prepare yourself and not to
[18:11] worry
[18:13] but joshua and caleb were the only two
[18:18] that did not complain did not murmur
[18:22] did not doubt but they followed the
[18:25] pillar of fire
[18:27] praise the lord hallelujah amen
[18:30] now of course you know i'm uncomfortable
[18:32] with this i'm not used to it at all
[18:34] so um that's all right um
[18:38] anyway they did not
[18:41] worry they did not complain but they
[18:45] followed the word of god for their day
[18:49] we asked and we are called upon to
[18:52] follow
[18:52] the word of god for our day
[18:56] and the devil will do everything
[18:59] he'll show you every flaw every fault
[19:02] every mistake
[19:05] everything so that you can begin to
[19:07] murmur
[19:09] you can begin to complain you have to
[19:12] begin to
[19:14] see this and see that and hear this and
[19:16] hear that
[19:17] and everything else but this is all
[19:20] distractions of the devil
[19:23] to take you off of the word of god
[19:27] hallelujah now we are referring to this
[19:31] verse
[19:32] because remember they had just come out
[19:36] of the patriarchal period
[19:39] and they were about to make a change
[19:43] as you know this covid and all these
[19:46] problems
[19:47] is because there is a change going on
[19:51] the world is changing the atmosphere is
[19:55] changing
[19:56] we know that the devil is bringing in
[19:59] his powers and his governments his
[20:02] systems
[20:03] and those of god is fixing to go
[20:07] out because he's going to have to have
[20:11] control for a certain period of time so
[20:14] that certain prophecies got to be
[20:15] fulfilled
[20:17] israel has to go back amen
[20:22] we know that the antichrist spirit has
[20:24] to come in
[20:26] we know the false prophet has to make
[20:28] himself manifest
[20:30] we know that the world council of
[20:34] churches the of revelation 18
[20:37] 19 17 18 and 19 is going to be made
[20:41] manifest we know that a woman
[20:44] will rule in the united states brother
[20:48] branham said i don't know
[20:49] if it's a church or a woman or it could
[20:52] be a church
[20:53] and a woman we don't know but it's all
[20:56] going to happen
[20:57] according to this word of god that we
[21:00] have received
[21:02] so all these things must take place
[21:07] now for the time that you were out there
[21:10] from march until this present time
[21:14] god made sure there was no pastor there
[21:20] there was no deacons there there was no
[21:23] trustees
[21:24] there's nobody to tell you anything
[21:28] so now the question will be how did you
[21:31] conduct your lives
[21:35] there was no king in israel nobody to
[21:38] tell them
[21:39] anything nobody that they have to
[21:43] look over their shoulder and check is
[21:44] the pastor watching
[21:47] did brother phillip hear about this or
[21:50] that
[21:52] what about brother mike what about
[21:53] brother daniel this is no you didn't
[21:55] have to think about that
[21:57] you could go along your life free and
[22:00] easy
[22:00] and clear nobody there and god allowed
[22:04] that
[22:06] he allowed it deliberately
[22:09] so that everyone would be able to
[22:12] conduct themselves
[22:14] without having to wear a mask
[22:20] i preached on it last week you don't
[22:24] have to put on a religious
[22:25] mask because a mask in front of me you
[22:29] may even convince me how good how pious
[22:31] how
[22:32] great consecrated and dedicated you are
[22:35] i'm just a human so you may
[22:37] you may deceive me i don't know
[22:40] unless god would reveal to me so
[22:44] therefore god gives you that freedom
[22:47] to let you make yourself manifest
[22:50] to see who you really are in the book of
[22:54] deuteronomy
[22:55] chapter eight listen
[22:59] uh verses one two three
[23:03] all the commandments which i commanded
[23:05] thee
[23:07] this day shall you observe to do that
[23:10] you may
[23:10] live and multiply and go in and possess
[23:14] the land
[23:15] which the lord swear unto your fathers
[23:19] and thou shalt remember all the way
[23:22] which the lord led thee
[23:25] for this 40 years
[23:29] in the willingness purpose of leading
[23:32] you in the wilderness
[23:33] purpose of letting you go on the covet
[23:36] 19
[23:37] purpose of why he allowed you to be by
[23:40] yourself
[23:42] right i let these 40 years in the will
[23:46] to humble thee to humble you
[23:51] to prove thee amen
[23:54] thirdly and to know what
[23:58] was in thine heart
[24:01] hallelujah whether thou would escape his
[24:05] commandments
[24:06] or no god wanted to test
[24:10] every one of us to see
[24:13] whether we would live by the word
[24:17] if there is no religious restraint
[24:21] no king no deacon
[24:25] no pastor no sunday service
[24:29] you know you're not gonna come and get
[24:32] your
[24:32] your sunday drink let me put it that way
[24:36] your sunday drink or your alcohol on
[24:39] sunday
[24:40] that will kind of spruce you up and
[24:43] spice you up
[24:44] so you leave rejoicing
[24:47] and you go forth in that strength for
[24:50] another two or three days and
[24:52] by the time you come to wednesday you
[24:54] get another bounce again
[24:55] and that keeps you to sunday and and you
[24:58] go on like that for
[25:00] years but if god took you and put you in
[25:04] the wilderness somewhere all by yourself
[25:06] will you be able to survive
[25:10] will you survive by his word
[25:13] praise god so god has deliberately
[25:17] allowed us to be out there and to be
[25:21] there
[25:21] with all these things around us now
[25:24] while i'm speaking you judge yourself
[25:27] i'm not here to judge you praise god
[25:30] because as i go on you will see later on
[25:32] why god allowed that
[25:35] you see for god has said in his word
[25:38] that he took us there that he might
[25:42] prove us proving what
[25:45] his word he has to prove
[25:48] which among us is really
[25:51] his word that was predestinated
[25:56] and foreknown by him
[25:59] we can all have a desire to serve god
[26:02] that's wonderful
[26:03] cain wanted to serve god he wanted to
[26:06] give god glory to
[26:07] but he wanted to do it his way not god's
[26:11] way
[26:11] but his own way praise god but we want
[26:14] to thank god
[26:16] for his holy spirit who is leading us
[26:20] that we might uh provide god
[26:23] with a service while doing his will
[26:27] praise the lord hallelujah let me turn
[26:30] this around
[26:31] the other way and see if it'll work a
[26:33] little better i know
[26:35] that um
[26:40] praise the lord
[26:44] hallelujah all right now
[26:48] he humbled thee and suffered thee to
[26:51] hunger
[26:53] fed thee with manna which thou knowest
[26:55] not needed to die
[26:56] fathers know that he might make
[26:59] thee know that man does
[27:02] not live by bread only
[27:06] but man thought every word that
[27:10] proceeded
[27:11] out of the mouth of god hallelujah
[27:15] so we live by god's
[27:18] revealed word the word out of the mouth
[27:22] of god
[27:23] not just the word on the pages of the
[27:25] bible but the word that comes freshly
[27:27] out of god's mouth
[27:30] and that you hear his word right to your
[27:33] ears
[27:34] and that faith comes by hearing and
[27:37] hearing
[27:37] by the word of god hallelujah
[27:41] be careful verse 10
[27:44] when thou was eaten and not full
[27:48] oh i know the message i i got it
[27:51] i got the revelation at the last
[27:54] prophet's message
[27:56] i've caught that look i know i know the
[27:58] seven church ages
[28:00] i don't have to listen to the broadcast
[28:02] on wednesday
[28:03] because i got the book and i read it and
[28:06] i know the message
[28:08] and i know this and i know that you eat
[28:11] and you're full
[28:14] you're full of the revelation you're
[28:15] full of the word you you believe your
[28:17] noise
[28:18] you believe that it's already right
[28:21] and uh thou shalt bless the lord
[28:25] thy god for the good land which he had
[28:28] given you
[28:29] are you happy today for this message
[28:32] are you happy for this good land which
[28:35] the lord has given us
[28:41] the prophet of god said in the
[28:43] leadership book that the holy spirit has
[28:45] led us into this found
[28:49] land of this message for this hour
[28:53] and i'm not talking about newfoundland
[28:55] up there i'm talking about this
[28:56] message that god led us to listen
[29:00] i've caught a hold of this
[29:03] i was in pentecost i was 14 years old
[29:08] i was in pentecost and when i say
[29:11] pentecost
[29:12] i'm talking about the real pentecost it
[29:14] was just
[29:15] to the tail end of it so i was barely
[29:18] able to see
[29:19] some of the real things of god like when
[29:22] uh that all rather come about i can
[29:25] remember his name
[29:26] a man of prayer and fasting and seeking
[29:28] god
[29:29] and he would raise up there and and and
[29:32] say
[29:34] somebody will be here on sunday to
[29:36] preach the word of god and he'll tell
[29:38] you
[29:38] he have on this kind of pants and this
[29:41] shirt
[29:42] and whatnot sunday we just sing the sims
[29:45] and we're just waiting the next thing
[29:47] you know bang the door open and here's a
[29:49] stranger
[29:50] and it comes in and you know he treats
[29:53] them and then the brother would ask if
[29:55] he's a preacher and where he's from and
[29:57] next thing you know he is a preacher
[29:59] and brother you know god that already
[30:02] told us you're coming you just go up
[30:04] and he'll preach the word of god and the
[30:07] power of god will come down
[30:09] amen and again you know what brother
[30:12] branham talk about people taking
[30:13] communion and
[30:15] and they have to back them out i've seen
[30:17] that man
[30:18] stand up and tell people that you touch
[30:21] that bread and drink that cup and
[30:23] they'll pack you out of here amen
[30:25] praise god hallelujah men of that nature
[30:29] not just him but there were others glory
[30:31] to god
[30:32] i seen one of those brothers preached
[30:36] and they sent missionaries from america
[30:38] to go and do missionary work
[30:41] when that man preaching a part of god
[30:44] fall in that place the missionaries are
[30:46] on their stomach
[30:48] they can't walk to the altar they have
[30:50] to crawl
[30:52] and that man is preaching the word of
[30:53] god demons are manifesting
[30:56] demons casting out all kinds of stuff
[30:58] while he is yet speaking
[31:01] so i seen the real pentecostal when i've
[31:03] seen all these guys getting up trying to
[31:06] copy cat brother branham
[31:08] it's good and no doubt they may even get
[31:10] some signs and some wonders
[31:12] like like those musicians they they had
[31:16] some
[31:16] signs too but moses almost
[31:20] swallowed theirs up and it's the same
[31:22] way brother sisters
[31:24] and so here we are
[31:28] having this word of god in this hour
[31:31] and so many copycats so much confusion
[31:35] that god allow all of this so that you
[31:39] can find yourself in him
[31:43] hallelujah because if you are not the
[31:46] original seed you won't make it true
[31:49] i said you won't make it true it doesn't
[31:53] matter that i preach the word of god to
[31:55] you because god allowed me to preach the
[31:57] word
[31:57] so that you will have a foundation so
[32:00] that when the winds come and the winds
[32:02] blow
[32:03] that you will you'll be funded on a rock
[32:06] so if the work comes and the winds blow
[32:08] and the trials come and it blows you
[32:10] away
[32:11] then what happened it means that you did
[32:14] not
[32:14] sit on the foundation that god
[32:18] gave to you praise the lord verse 16
[32:22] who fed thee in the wilderness with
[32:24] manna
[32:25] which thy fathers knew not amen
[32:29] that he might humbly that he might prove
[32:32] thee
[32:34] to do the good in the latter end
[32:38] now you know brother branham preached
[32:40] the great message all
[32:42] god's gifts will find their appropriate
[32:45] places
[32:46] all god's appropriate gifts are going to
[32:49] find their places
[32:51] and this covet 19 all the tests and the
[32:54] trials that come
[32:56] with it is exactly to do that
[32:59] that everything will find its place
[33:03] it doesn't matter that you sat here and
[33:05] you've been in the church and you follow
[33:07] the message
[33:08] you are going to be tested if you
[33:10] haven't been already
[33:12] and it's going to do that so that you
[33:15] can
[33:15] come to your appropriate place
[33:18] and find whoever you are listen what
[33:22] brother branham said i mean the bible
[33:24] says here matthew 13
[33:26] again the kingdom of heaven is like onto
[33:29] a net
[33:31] that was cast into the sea
[33:34] and garnered of every kind
[33:38] which when it was full they drew it to
[33:41] shore
[33:42] and sat down and gathered the good
[33:46] into vessels and cast
[33:49] the bad away quoting brother branham
[33:54] speaking now
[33:55] now a preacher he is there just to throw
[33:59] out the net he pulls him
[34:03] and in that great net the bible teaches
[34:07] he brings in everything hallelujah
[34:11] oh my praise god brother simon is a
[34:13] wonderful preacher praise the lord
[34:15] hallelujah
[34:16] so everybody that came in under his
[34:18] ministry are
[34:19] all predestinated chosen
[34:22] and they are all of god no
[34:25] we don't know that only god can prove
[34:28] that
[34:30] only god can test that and prove that
[34:32] not
[34:33] even i cannot say to you i
[34:36] know for sure you're one of them
[34:39] it might tell my senses might tell me
[34:42] that but that doesn't mean anything
[34:45] it's god must testify about abel's gifts
[34:49] his gods must testify about the
[34:52] eternal life the gift of god is eternal
[34:56] life
[34:56] and only he can testify about that
[35:01] now that preacher pulls in
[35:04] and in that net he brings in water
[35:07] spiders
[35:08] can you say amen frogs
[35:13] snakes lizards
[35:17] terrapins which is to say
[35:20] um what do you call them again terrapins
[35:23] is uh
[35:24] tertius turtis right or we say
[35:27] turtle right
[35:31] tap balls and also
[35:34] fish now it's not for me to determine
[35:38] or to judge any of them which is fish
[35:43] which is snake and which is that poles
[35:47] but you'll just watch them the
[35:51] nature that is in them will prove
[35:54] what they are because
[35:58] when the trials and the tests come you
[36:00] are going to
[36:01] find out who you really are you know
[36:05] one time uh
[36:08] muhammad ali had to fight joe former um
[36:12] what's his name again joe
[36:16] joe frazer yes that's him joe frazer
[36:20] and muhammad ali getting there
[36:23] and they start to box and you know he
[36:26] likes to talk while he's boxing
[36:29] so they start the box and
[36:32] he says man joe he says you made a
[36:35] mistake they put you in here to fight
[36:37] me he says they write you up
[36:41] and talking about you're a tiger and all
[36:43] of this stuff
[36:44] and so on like that and he says man i'm
[36:47] going to teach you a lot
[36:48] for the day
[36:52] so joe fraser said that's all right
[36:55] he says that's okay he said well when i
[36:58] put some
[36:58] pressure on you you're gonna go back to
[37:02] all them all habits that you had and
[37:05] then i'm gonna take you to pieces
[37:08] and that's exactly what joe frazer did
[37:10] he started
[37:11] putting pressure on him you know how he
[37:14] used to box
[37:14] he never stopped once he start he's just
[37:17] coming at you with all those red cross
[37:19] and
[37:20] uppercuts and everything else like that
[37:22] and
[37:23] so muhammad said man he says joe while
[37:25] they're boxing
[37:26] he says joe they told me in the paper
[37:30] you were a paper tiger he said they told
[37:32] you wrong
[37:34] ben and
[37:36] really took him apart praise the lord
[37:39] but the point is that joe fraser was
[37:41] making
[37:42] doesn't matter how much training you do
[37:46] when you're under pressure you're going
[37:48] to go
[37:49] right back to your original style
[37:52] which you think is good and that's with
[37:56] every human being
[37:58] when the trails of life and the problems
[38:01] begin to hit you
[38:03] you go right back to your original form
[38:07] hallelujah and then you show your real
[38:10] nature
[38:12] that's been hiding underneath the mask
[38:16] it begins to show up your
[38:20] nature will prove what they are
[38:23] you watch the gospel message
[38:27] many will come to the altar wow the nets
[38:30] got them
[38:32] but mr turtle will stick his head up and
[38:35] say
[38:36] i didn't believe it all from the very
[38:39] beginning
[38:41] i didn't believe the message i just
[38:43] followed it to see what it was like
[38:46] and uh and the snake will say you know
[38:50] there is something about what you just
[38:52] said
[38:53] so she he didn't say it but the turkish
[38:57] say it
[38:57] so he can still pull himself out he's a
[39:00] snake
[39:00] cunning smart subtle he said all that
[39:04] holy roller stuff i can't stop see
[39:08] and then the old mrs spider starts plop
[39:11] plop plop
[39:13] and she goes right back it was that to
[39:16] start with
[39:18] it's just that the net went over them
[39:21] that's exactly right but the fish
[39:24] was fish when the net over them
[39:28] and the spider was a spider when it went
[39:31] over them we are singing for fish
[39:35] god's the one to determine who is in
[39:38] that net
[39:41] so i'm preaching here but you yourself
[39:44] by the word
[39:46] to see where you are and what role you
[39:49] played
[39:50] during the time of us being separated
[39:54] one from the other you're separated from
[39:57] us but you're not separating from him
[40:00] and how did you act during that time oh
[40:03] thank god i'm free
[40:05] i'm free from all these brethren being
[40:08] around me
[40:09] watching me is not f brethren watching
[40:11] you if there's an
[40:12] eye that's watching you all the time
[40:16] god's watching you all the time praise
[40:19] god hallelujah
[40:20] reverend random speaking again white
[40:22] people can't keep the victory
[40:24] when a man preaches a revival
[40:27] under the power and demonstration of the
[40:30] holy spirit
[40:32] a net is drawn around the people
[40:35] that's right and if he's a bug to begin
[40:38] with
[40:39] he's a bug at the end of the revival
[40:42] if he's a water spider the first thing
[40:45] you know he'll go around saying
[40:47] i don't believe in this i don't believe
[40:49] in that
[40:50] and he'll plop he'll go right back to
[40:53] his
[40:53] old way back to the water if he's a
[40:56] snake he'll say
[40:57] i told you so i told you about it
[41:01] and where he will go he was a snake by
[41:05] nature to begin with see he has
[41:08] never been nothing else oh my
[41:11] see he can't be nothing else a man
[41:15] can't join church and just think he can
[41:18] get
[41:18] emotional and get all worked up
[41:21] and that makes him a christian no
[41:25] it's got to be a solid birth
[41:28] in the holy spirit dying out
[41:31] sincerely hallelujah crying out
[41:34] and leaving there until you're dead
[41:37] praise god
[41:38] i know i'm speaking but while i'm
[41:40] speaking the word of god is searching
[41:42] your heart
[41:44] and you're going to search your own self
[41:46] by the grace of god hallelujah
[41:49] oh my praise god listen to brother
[41:51] branham again
[41:52] speaking here in hebrews chapter six
[41:55] he said i am preaching he said actually
[41:59] i am
[41:59] pulling i am pulling there they
[42:03] are lord you know what they are i am
[42:06] just here to pull in the net
[42:10] all right now the turtle was a turtle to
[42:14] begin with but he just got caught
[42:16] in the net that's right people get
[42:19] caught up with emotion with oh
[42:22] hallelujah oh hallelujah
[42:24] oh praise the lord glory to god
[42:26] hallelujah
[42:27] you see what they got caught in the
[42:31] net but that all turtle spirit
[42:34] is still in them and on them
[42:37] and it's going it going to be long that
[42:40] they'll begin to say
[42:42] well i tell you this i tell you that and
[42:44] they'll go
[42:45] creeping right back to what they were
[42:50] old lady crawfish will just say i can't
[42:52] understand this i can't understand that
[42:54] and she'll back away from it
[42:58] miss spider there sat there for a little
[43:00] while and
[43:01] back she'll go
[43:04] mrs serpent will say oh
[43:08] that bunch of church people you're a
[43:10] snake to begin with
[43:12] the gospel net just caught you but the
[43:16] fish is took to the master's table
[43:19] for it was a fish to begin with the seed
[43:23] in him that was a fish to begin with
[43:26] so he began as a fish god knowed him as
[43:30] a fish
[43:30] from the foundations of the world and
[43:33] hallelujah
[43:35] that's what is he is praise god but
[43:38] remember he said
[43:39] they were all at one time breathing in
[43:42] the same
[43:43] muddy sinful water all of them were out
[43:47] there in the same water
[43:49] breathing in the same old dirty creek
[43:54] we were all made to drink of the
[43:56] spiritual rock
[43:58] eat the same manner joshua and caleb at
[44:02] the same manner that was in the
[44:03] wilderness
[44:05] and that the rest of them eat and they
[44:07] all
[44:08] fell in the wilderness only the two
[44:11] elected got over
[44:15] and went over to the other side
[44:18] praise the lord hallelujah amen
[44:21] don't you see why we made to rejoice
[44:23] together and why we are made to give god
[44:26] the glory
[44:27] and the praise and the honor together
[44:30] because that's the way
[44:32] that god made us to be one in the lord
[44:35] jesus christ
[44:36] hallelujah amen brother sister this is
[44:40] what's happening here today
[44:42] i am preaching about what is happening
[44:44] right now
[44:46] that we are all being tested and tried
[44:50] by what we have all been brought
[44:53] into here by the grace of god when you
[44:56] go home check it again
[44:58] hebrews chapter 7 brother branham
[45:00] speaking here
[45:02] praise the lord the kingdom of heaven is
[45:05] like
[45:05] unto a man who went to a lake
[45:09] a river or a pond and throwed
[45:12] in his net he had
[45:15] turtles he had everything in there
[45:19] scavengers but he had some fish
[45:22] see the man is just singing as i am now
[45:25] just preaching the gospel
[45:29] and many will come to the altar and they
[45:31] cry and cry and cry that's not my
[45:34] business
[45:34] i wasn't sent here to judge what and who
[45:37] and whatever
[45:38] you see that's the reason why a lot of
[45:40] people uh
[45:41] have found my ministry and preaching to
[45:45] be kind of different
[45:46] because they'll come to the church and
[45:49] they'll see
[45:50] people dress differently
[45:53] they're not dressed in one right
[45:58] because the lord showed me that years
[46:00] ago
[46:01] no field ripens all the fruit written on
[46:05] the same day
[46:07] all the fruit on the tree grew up to a
[46:10] certain level on the same day
[46:12] and just so in the church people are at
[46:14] different stages
[46:16] of growth one may come in still wearing
[46:20] on
[46:21] the dress a little short or you know the
[46:24] pants a little tight or
[46:26] the pants a little low is that right
[46:29] and maybe you have a kind of a walk
[46:31] along with that
[46:33] you know
[46:38] you know you got that kind of a walk
[46:40] that those guys got in new york there
[46:42] you know they kind of
[46:47] they they got the right walk along with
[46:49] it
[46:50] but the fact is brother sister
[46:54] all have to come up at their own level
[47:00] i had a preacher look at one of the
[47:01] brothers in the church here and say you
[47:02] gotta cut that here man
[47:05] look look how you got you here what kind
[47:06] of uh that's not christian
[47:09] well i don't really know what is
[47:11] christian when you say
[47:13] christian god brother abraham said i
[47:15] don't care if he hears purple pink or
[47:17] green
[47:18] and he said i don't really care about
[47:19] that that's not the problem
[47:22] not that he was urging people to go and
[47:25] have their hair purple and pink and
[47:26] green
[47:27] or to have their lips purple pink or
[47:30] green
[47:31] or to their nails done in different ways
[47:34] or whatever
[47:35] like jezebel no it's not that he was
[47:37] doing that
[47:38] but he's saying just be yourself
[47:41] be free be who you are
[47:45] and if the holy spirit doesn't
[47:48] restrain you guide you direct you
[47:52] back to the word to change your actions
[47:55] and the way you walk and live then
[47:58] check yourself recognize what spirit
[48:03] you're of
[48:04] because if the holy spirit is on you
[48:07] he'll make you
[48:08] act like himself if you're one of his
[48:11] children he'll direct you how to act
[48:13] and how to walk other than that
[48:17] don't just come in the church and
[48:19] tighten up and try to cover up and hide
[48:21] no
[48:22] it's better you just relax and just be
[48:24] who you are
[48:26] and let the let the brothers and the
[48:28] sisters
[48:29] know exactly where you're at and then
[48:31] they're able to pray for you and pray
[48:34] with you
[48:35] and walk with you so there is no real
[48:37] tension in coming to this church
[48:40] or being here that somebody is going to
[48:42] look down on you
[48:43] and if anybody does do that it would
[48:45] reflect on them
[48:47] of how spiritual they are and where
[48:50] their growth is
[48:51] if they're to react on you in that kind
[48:54] of a way
[48:55] praise the lord hallelujah more mine
[48:58] brother branham speaking and the man
[49:02] that is born of the spirit of god
[49:05] hates the things of the world for if you
[49:09] love the world or the things of the
[49:12] world
[49:13] then the love of god is not in you
[49:17] if i run around with women every day
[49:20] and come and tell my wife in the evening
[49:24] that i loved her she'd know that i was
[49:27] nothing but a liar is that right
[49:32] think about it certainly i proved to her
[49:35] i didn't love her
[49:37] because i wasn't true to her
[49:40] she told me she if she told me she loved
[49:42] me every time
[49:44] i'd be gone and she'd take off with
[49:46] somebody else
[49:47] it would prove that she didn't love me
[49:51] her actions prove it i don't care how
[49:54] much she tried to tell me that
[49:56] her actions would speak louder
[50:00] than her words oh my
[50:03] think of it there's no one else in the
[50:06] world but you
[50:07] she would say to me but yet when i'm
[50:10] gone she's gone with somebody else
[50:12] that will make me know she's nothing but
[50:15] a liar
[50:16] and when you try to say lord i love you
[50:20] i love you and yet you are doing things
[50:23] to the world
[50:24] god knows you're a liar to begin with
[50:28] so that's the use to accept a halfway
[50:31] experience
[50:32] something another like that when the
[50:36] skies of heaven are full of the holy
[50:39] ghost
[50:40] do you what do you want to be a
[50:42] miserable
[50:43] proof
[50:49] we are real born again child of god
[50:53] with the joy bells of heaven ringing
[50:57] rejoicing praising god
[51:01] and living a life of victory through
[51:04] jesus christ praise the lord i'm going
[51:07] to stop
[51:08] here for today praise the lord
[51:11] i'm going to stop right now i intended
[51:14] to go on till about 12
[51:15] 30 but it's okay i'm gonna stop here
[51:18] it's our first day
[51:19] and we gotta i gotta find myself
[51:22] as much as you gotta find yourself here
[51:26] in the presence of the living god and i
[51:28] pray god will bless us all together
[51:30] as we come together in the uh in these
[51:34] coming days praise the lord after the
[51:37] service is over
[51:38] i'd like to see you um jose i'd like to
[51:41] see you all
[51:42] praise the lord in the back for a moment
[51:44] praise god
[51:45] i'm glad to see every one of you
[51:56] if you notice i picked up where i left
[51:58] off
[51:59] because i stopped by preaching on the
[52:01] provocation in the wilderness
[52:03] i hope you do not provoke him during
[52:06] this time
[52:08] while you're out there by yourself
[52:10] praise the lord
[52:12] because that is the temptation to start
[52:15] doing all kinds of little things
[52:17] nobody's there nobody's seeing you
[52:19] observing you
[52:20] but god is watching he is seeing
[52:23] he is observing and he knows our own
[52:27] hearts
[52:28] i ask you to bow your head close your
[52:30] eyes right now
[52:31] and i want you to talk to god
[52:35] may the great holy spirit
[52:38] speak to your heart
[52:41] but you know better than anyone else
[52:47] our gracious heavenly father
[52:51] with heads bowed and eyes closed and
[52:54] hearts reaching
[52:55] to you may the great holy spirit father
[53:00] speak into the hearts of your people
[53:03] and maybe may they recognize what i have
[53:06] said
[53:08] and may they measure themselves by the
[53:11] standards of god's word
[53:14] and see where they're at
[53:17] how they have been conducting themselves
[53:21] during this time we're away from
[53:24] one another and father as the
[53:28] journey continues we pray
[53:31] that the great angel of god will protect
[53:33] us every step of the way
[53:36] so that we will come to the end of our
[53:38] life's journey
[53:41] sheltered by the blood of the lamb
[53:45] in the name of jesus christ of the glory
[53:47] of god
[53:48] amen
[53:52] there's a woman at the well
[53:57] that was seeking
[54:00] for things that could not
[54:05] satisfy
[54:09] but then she heard
[54:13] our savior speaking
[54:17] draw free will
[54:20] which never shall run cry
[54:25] let's sing it feel
[54:31] i lifted up
[54:40] [Music]
[54:48] my soul
[54:55] [Music]
[54:59] [Applause]
[55:05] fill my cup
[55:07] [Music]
[55:08] fill it up
[55:12] [Music]
[55:16] this coming wednesday by the grace of
[55:19] god we will be online
[55:21] we will be continuing our study in the
[55:24] seven church ages and we pray
[55:28] that the holy spirit will bless us
[55:31] as we come together to study the word of
[55:34] god
[55:35] may god bless every one of you
[55:38] and uh may he keep you during the rest
[55:41] of the week
[55:43] and bring us together again now before i
[55:46] close
[55:46] i mean i mentioned this brother danny
[55:49] and his family are away on holiday
[55:52] brother joshua and sister
[55:56] charlotte god has led them by his holy
[55:59] spirit
[56:01] to go and minister the word of god in
[56:03] the province of new brunswick
[56:07] and so they have uprooted themselves
[56:10] sold their house
[56:11] bought one there and they've gone to
[56:15] live
[56:15] in new brunswick and to minister the
[56:18] word of god
[56:19] we made the necessary connections we
[56:21] have to make there
[56:23] and for believers that are scattered
[56:25] with no pastor
[56:28] that they will be able to at least not
[56:31] just having to go
[56:32] and search to find a few people but that
[56:35] there would be people there already
[56:38] whether it's 5 10 20 i don't know but
[56:42] they have been quarantined for the past
[56:45] two weeks
[56:46] so they haven't been able to do anything
[56:49] i believe their quarantine ends this
[56:52] weekend
[56:53] so from next week then people will be
[56:56] able to contact
[56:58] them and stuff will begin to happen
[57:01] but just so you know that that's what
[57:03] the holy spirit is doing
[57:06] also from the broadcast
[57:10] when it's from india china wherever
[57:14] from kenya a couple of pastors
[57:17] have already written to brother danny
[57:20] wanting to bring their
[57:22] churches uh which some a couple of them
[57:25] have
[57:26] you know few hundreds of people to bring
[57:29] them onto my ministry
[57:32] but i told you know i just let them know
[57:34] i am not
[57:35] that kind of a bishop that you all are
[57:38] thinking about and it's not necessary
[57:42] for you to come under my ministry there
[57:44] are men right in the country right there
[57:47] that have the message like i have it
[57:51] so they can contact you and you can
[57:53] discuss with them
[57:55] and you can grow from there but i'm
[57:58] letting you know that just so you know
[57:59] that the
[58:01] sermons online are taking effect
[58:12] and just so you know that people listen
[58:15] from around the world
[58:16] you go and you just see maybe 34 people
[58:20] 200 people that's what you see there but
[58:24] when you're going to
[58:25] if you could get the the electronics to
[58:28] get
[58:29] behind the scenes and be able to see um
[58:33] then their numbers that they have
[58:36] then you will see that some of those
[58:38] sermons is thousands of people
[58:41] from india pakistan
[58:45] afghanistan romania czechoslovakia all
[58:49] around the world brazil
[58:50] colombia wherever they are watching and
[58:53] they are listening
[58:54] to these messages so
[58:58] uh they this is happening
[59:01] all because of your faith your prayers
[59:06] and your support the ministry is
[59:08] changing
[59:09] it's not just anymore just being in the
[59:11] church here
[59:13] it's reaching out hallelujah
[59:16] way beyond these walls hallelujah
[59:21] jesus had a church with no walls
[59:25] and that's what's happening now he's
[59:27] staring down the walls
[59:29] so that the ministry is going beyond the
[59:32] wall
[59:33] to reach people wherever they are around
[59:36] the world
[59:37] around the world praise god a brother
[59:40] called also from romania
[59:46] and he needed some help
[59:49] because they just were about to throw
[59:51] him out in the streets
[59:54] like the next day him and his wife and
[59:56] children would be out on the streets
[59:59] a believer the message we confirmed it
[1:00:03] we talked to brother bischo and those
[1:00:05] brothers who have ministries in those
[1:00:07] areas
[1:00:08] and they knew the pastor in the area and
[1:00:11] the church that he went to
[1:00:13] so i got that information so i want to
[1:00:15] know it's not just somebody call up and
[1:00:17] pulling a trick
[1:00:18] to say that they need help it was a
[1:00:21] brother
[1:00:22] but because of the broadcast being there
[1:00:26] and the name of this church going out
[1:00:30] people are reaching out in different
[1:00:32] ways
[1:00:34] and our ministry is expanding from just
[1:00:38] uh ministering to you alone here
[1:00:41] in the building i may be speaking to you
[1:00:44] here
[1:00:44] alone in the building but from the
[1:00:47] uh broadcast that's going out online
[1:00:51] we are reaching thousands so we ought to
[1:00:55] give god praise and honor of glory
[1:00:58] [Applause]
[1:01:03] we are able to help another preacher in
[1:01:06] the nature
[1:01:07] in the nation of guyana south america
[1:01:11] praise the lord that was in dire straits
[1:01:14] and needed help
[1:01:16] and so we reached out to them
[1:01:20] as far as i know with a one-time
[1:01:22] assistance
[1:01:24] and to be able to help them to
[1:01:27] get on their feet and get on with the
[1:01:30] work of god
[1:01:31] that they have to get on with and we
[1:01:33] give god
[1:01:34] praise and honor and glory so i want you
[1:01:36] to know we were not asleep
[1:01:38] during this period we were locked down
[1:01:40] as you could see there was baptisms
[1:01:42] going on
[1:01:43] there were people being reached lines
[1:01:46] being hard
[1:01:47] touched and ministries
[1:01:50] that that appreciate the message
[1:01:54] that they're hearing the truth and even
[1:01:56] if they never came
[1:01:57] in to the message they're going to
[1:02:00] preach some of the things that they
[1:02:01] heard me
[1:02:02] saying and it's going to bless others
[1:02:05] and the true seed are going to catch
[1:02:07] that and if they have to come out
