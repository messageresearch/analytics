[33:43] and not being brother Branham I don't
[33:47] have a two-hour sermon or four hours but
[33:50] uh
[33:51] just something simple that we could
[33:53] share and rejoice with each other amen
[33:58] Hallelujah
[33:59] this is our scripture found in the Book
[34:05] of John
[34:08] chapter 2
[34:09] verses 18 to 21.
[34:14] and it reads
[34:16] then answered the Jews and said unto him
[34:20] what sign showest thou unto us seeing
[34:25] that thou doest these things
[34:28] Jesus answered and said unto them
[34:31] destroyed this Temple
[34:33] and in three days I will raise it up
[34:37] again
[34:38] then said the Jews 14-6 years was this
[34:42] templin building
[34:43] and will thou rear it up in three days
[34:49] but
[34:50] he spake
[34:52] of the Temple of his body

[34:59] for the reading of the word share with
[35:01] us your understanding wisdom and Grace

[35:14] tree in the name of Jesus Christ we ask
[35:17] it amen praise the Lord God bless you

[35:25] it's Resurrection time again for the
[35:28] bride
[35:29] and I believe it amen but now it's not
[35:33] the resurrection of Jesus it's the
[35:35] resurrection of his bride
[35:39] the head has already been raised up
[35:42] but now the body is being raised up
[35:47] praise the Lord and that's what we want
[35:50] to talk about here tonight listen uh all
[35:54] most of these thoughts come from the
[35:57] restoration of the bright tree
[35:59] amen this tree is a different kind of a
[36:04] tree
[36:05] it goes from place to place
[36:09] it goes from one place to another place
[36:14] from one dispensation to another
[36:17] dispensation
[36:19] from Luther
[36:20] it went to Wesley from Wesley it went to
[36:24] Pentecost and went from Pentecost
[36:30] it will go to the word
[36:33] amen hallelujah he went through
[36:36] justification sanctification baptism
[36:38] Holy Spirit and gifts and then he says
[36:41] from there it goes to their word
[36:44] Hallelujah aren't you glad that tree is
[36:46] going to the word or has gone to the
[36:49] word because we are in the tree right
[36:51] now

[36:58] another Resurrection glory to God

[38:07] seed that was hid in The Roots the word

[38:31] revealed praise God back to the word it
[38:35] went through the entire cycle it went
[38:37] from seed it went through the springtime
[38:40] and so on right through the summer and

[38:44] by Harvest time it's gone through the
[38:47] cycle back to seed again Hallelujah and
[38:51] I'm glad it's back to the seed word

[38:57] saw that but you know wasn't as strong
[39:01] upon it but I could see that that the uh
[39:05] from way back but now you see it clearer
[39:08] that everything started with Jesus and
[39:11] went through the resurrection went to
[39:13] everything and then it went to Pentecost
[39:16] and then I found that people were making
[39:19] we should be excited about Pentecost
[39:22] it's a great thing and we should always
[39:23] be happy for Pentecost it's one
[39:25] wonderful but really what the entire
[39:30] cycle is is not bringing it just a
[39:33] Pentecost that's just the trees start
[39:35] growing again
[39:36] it brings it right through the cycle
[39:39] back to the seed from seed to seed from
[39:42] alpha to Omega is that right that's the
[39:46] way God's law of Life uh is that's the
[39:50] way it works so that's how we must see
[39:53] it in the types and in the symbols all
[39:56] praise His wonderful name amen for that

[46:17] he was the same yesterday today and
[46:21] forever praise God in other words when
[46:24] those ages like Luther and Wesley and
[46:27] them started to see the gifts manifested
[46:30] and seeing the supernatural taking place
[46:32] among the people he is categorizing that
[46:36] as a rumor starting to go out that that
[46:40] the church is really dead Jesus is not
[46:42] really dead the life is still here Among
[46:45] Us praise God and started going out as a
[46:49] rumor but remember
[46:52] it was at the end of that third day
[46:58] after all them signs after all them
[47:00] wonders after all those wonderful things
[47:03] that is where he himself
[47:08] makes himself known
[47:11] come right among his own people and
[47:16] begin to call out to them and say look
[47:20] at me the word that's not there but I'm
[47:23] putting that in so you understand what
[47:25] he's saying look at me the word amen I
[47:29] am the same one Hallelujah that was at
[47:33] the beginning and here he is now at the
[47:36] end Oh Glory to God Amen you see God
[47:40] allowed them dead forms to go on right
[47:44] until
[47:45] Pentecost came and then the rumors
[47:50] started to go around Hallelujah that he
[47:55] is here again in this last day moving
[47:59] Among Us is also in a nice way without
[48:02] saying us saying it to us telling us
[48:05] that that's good but that was not the
[48:08] word
[48:09] right it's after all of that happened at
[48:14] the end praise God we can go back you
[48:17] know what the end of that third day is
[48:20] end of the Pentecostal dispensation and
[48:23] the Pentecostal dispensation of which he
[48:27] was the messenger which is what a lot of
[48:30] people don't understand that brother
[48:32] Brown's role was twofold he was the one
[48:36] to restore the word right and to be the
[48:40] messenger to that Pentecostal uh age and
[48:45] he there could be no higher
[48:46] manifestation of that than his life is
[48:49] that right but then he was also to be
[48:54] the the what the man who stands in the
[48:57] gap
[48:59] to to point us the way from
[49:04] Pentecost over to the world
[49:09] but once the word come on the scene you
[49:11] will see that coming to the ending of
[49:13] his teaching on the seals he started
[49:15] saying
[49:16] I can't stay any longer I must decrease
[49:20] that he might increase
[49:22] for two of us cannot be on the earth at
[49:26] the same time
[49:27] what one has to go on one says so he had
[49:32] to go and he went like the first Elijah
[49:34] went up in a fiery uh Mercedes uh is
[49:39] that that's not what the Bible says but
[49:40] I'm saying that you might understand for
[49:42] our day it wouldn't be horses it would
[49:45] be in a car and that's he that's how he
[49:47] died in a car crash right that's how he
[49:50] died in a car crash and went to be with
[49:52] the Lord glory to God so we are thankful
[49:55] that all the time simple as you see it

[51:12] one talking with us you remember when he
[51:15] went with them uh not to go over all
[51:17] this stuff but after his resurrection

[55:22] forth like that amen the same light that
[55:25] was in the east the same light shine uh
[55:29] now shine on that first church and the
[55:34] Romans cut down that tree
[55:38] by their Pagan worship

[55:50] again amen and what does it come out for
[55:54] amen it's come out to restore to raise
[55:59] up the evening light the same purpose as
[56:04] the Morning Light amen that tree that
[56:07] was cut down through the Dark Ages
[56:10] through Roman Dogma God is restoring her

[56:33] it's restoring the whole word of God
[56:38] again
[56:40] bringing the full manifestation of
[56:43] Christ in his church
[56:46] and what was coming to me was it was the
[56:49] evening light but then he starts singing
[56:53] and talking and now the evening lights
[56:57] have come Christ in the church and many
[57:01] membered body a bright body hallelujah
[57:05] amen Shine Your Light in which corner
[57:08] wherever you are you shine it in your
[57:11] corner I'll shine it in my corner unless
[57:14] together shine and represent the word
[57:17] the evening lights have come it is a
[57:20] fact that God and Christ are one
[57:24] the evening lights have come is the fact
[57:27] that Christ and his bride are one a man
[57:31] a man remembered body but yet they're
[57:34] one hallelujah praise God Amen yes sir
[57:39] and he himself used the words right here
[57:43] he says the evening lights according to
[57:47] prophecy
[57:48] amen according to prophecy amen oh yes
[57:53] so here it is now one we see that God is
[57:59] first going to prune off
[58:01] some of them branches that were there he
[58:07] will even allow bugs to eat them up see
[58:10] oh oh my and then you buy get them bound

[58:16] and then will be the time of waiting
[58:19] waiting to be burned amen I'm not saying
[58:24] all will be burned because some will
[58:26] come to themselves some will recognize
[58:28] and and pull out but this is the time

[58:35] they are waiting Amen in the same way
[58:38] amen oh praise God hallelujah he says
[58:42] wonderful
[58:43] amen now we see what's happening that it
[58:49] is the fruits on the top of the tree
[58:53] that begins to ripen first you believe
[58:57] that
[58:58] amen hallelujah see why because the
[59:05] evening light in other words he doesn't
[59:07] say it openly but it strikes them first
[59:10] they begin to see the evening light I'm
[59:13] thinking now of when Emancipation
[59:15] Proclamation for the slaves dug in the
[59:18] South he says some of them that were
[59:20] strong enough and young enough they
[59:22] climbed to the top of the highest
[59:24] buildings and they were looking for that
[59:27] sun to come up he sent us the sun soon
[59:29] as the sun came up they began to shout
[59:32] we're free praise God we're free we're
[59:35] not on the law we're on the grace
[59:38] we're not bound we're free praise the
[59:42] Lord we're not on the legalism we enter
[59:44] the light of the world we're under the
[59:46] freedom of the Holy Spirit we are not
[59:49] under lawlessness and then calling that
[59:52] Liberty
[59:54] we're under the word of God
[59:57] and we are free within the Limitless
[1:00:01] boundaries of the word of God hallelujah
[1:00:04] I said it before I say it again the a
[1:00:07] race horse is free there's those horses
[1:00:10] that say we are free but then they run
[1:00:12] off and they run on the hills and the
[1:00:14] mountains and everything else but the
[1:00:16] racehorse he allows as brother Branham
[1:00:19] says he allows the rider to train him
[1:00:22] and write him amen and he runs and he
[1:00:26] wins the race and he gets a crown or a
[1:00:28] cup praise the lord we are running in
[1:00:31] line with the word amen so we can have a
[1:00:34] praise like Paul said amen you're not
[1:00:37] just running here running there running
[1:00:39] all over the place you settle down
[1:00:41] you'll stay with the word you stay
[1:00:44] established establishing Christ
[1:00:46] hallelujah amen keep your eyes looking
[1:00:49] away to Jesus

[1:00:54] the church we're not looking for a a new
[1:00:56] this or a new that no sir we're not in
[1:00:58] any Monkey Business where we're looking

[1:01:28] believe they are here now and they're
[1:01:31] shining for the glory of God Amen oh oh
[1:01:35] so we know if it will shine to the on
[1:01:40] the top of the tree the Capstone

[1:01:50] top of the tree it is the top of the
[1:01:54] tree that sees the evening light and
[1:01:58] ripens first amen for this age amen
