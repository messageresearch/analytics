[34:17] [Music]
[34:23] [Applause]

[34:32] tell me
[34:35] [Music]
[34:40] amen praise God
[34:43] God bless you Saints welcome into the
[34:46] house of the Lord on a Wednesday night
[34:48] our midweek service
[34:50] I know it's not easy
[34:52] for uh for you to get here sometimes
[34:56] you know the cares of this life and the
[34:59] the workload and
[35:01] these days you know like families need
[35:04] to work extra hard you know inflation is
[35:09] taking a toll God bless you say it's you
[35:11] may be seated
[35:13] inflation is certainly taking a great
[35:15] toll on
[35:16] on many people and they're finding it
[35:18] more difficult and so they have to work
[35:20] more they got to take part-time jobs
[35:23] interest rates have gone up
[35:27] um I left a bottle of water in the
[35:30] sanctuary if somebody could just grab me
[35:32] that bottle of water I'd appreciate it
[35:34] amen and so here we are
[35:37] uh you know in in the uh
[35:40] in a time where the world is uh in such
[35:42] a condition like
[35:45] um like
[35:46] just
[35:47] something to deal with
[35:49] and each and every family every home
[35:51] every individual is feeling the pressure
[35:54] that's coming down in this time in this
[35:58] age that we're living in amen and so by
[36:01] the grace of God
[36:03] we've been
[36:04] uh
[36:06] prepared for this type of
[36:09] condition by the grace of God God
[36:12] planned it that you would be in this
[36:15] time and in this season and that you
[36:18] would be uh
[36:20] filled with overcoming power
[36:23] so that you could deal with the
[36:26] circumstances that you're living in
[36:27] because you are the word that will be
[36:31] made manifest in this day and in this
[36:33] hour to prove God's word
[36:35] to prove that there are people that can
[36:39] overcome can overcome the trials and the
[36:42] testings and these this is what we're
[36:44] going to be looking at a little bit here
[36:46] tonight
[36:48] um we're going to be looking to let's
[36:50] open our Bibles to First Corinthians
[36:54] chapter 4.
[36:57] it's Bible study right
[36:59] so we are going to study
[37:02] a a certain aspect of the word of God
[37:04] tonight our title is character for the
[37:07] rapture
[37:09] the kind of character that God is
[37:11] building you and preparing you thank you
[37:14] brother for the Rapture amen
[37:17] he's preparing you he's given you a
[37:19] certain element of Faith so that you can
[37:22] overcome we've been on this series of
[37:24] rapturing faith and I believe that that
[37:27] we're under expectation that we need to
[37:30] know that God is going to give us what
[37:32] we need we need to be under the right
[37:35] expectation because you cannot
[37:38] overcome and fight the powers and the
[37:42] influences of this world
[37:44] you personally cannot do it you will
[37:48] blow up you will get frustrated you will
[37:51] get tired you know let's read the word
[37:54] of God and then let's let's look at some
[37:56] things so First Corinthians chapter 3
[37:58] we're going to read from verse 9.
[38:03] amen
[38:05] let us pray first father we're so
[38:07] grateful for your word tonight Lord that
[38:09] we can come
[38:11] hear and assemble ourselves in such a
[38:13] way Lord with expectation in our hearts
[38:15] Lord I am as much under expectation as
[38:20] everyone that's here and everyone that's
[38:22] listening in online here tonight father
[38:25] if there's expectation in our hearts
[38:29] then you Lord will meet that expectation
[38:32] and so we ask you to take control of
[38:35] your word now anoint the speaker anoint
[38:38] our ears give us the Revelation Lord
[38:40] that we need to overcome in this hour in
[38:44] Jesus name amen
[38:46] praise God
[38:49] for we are laborers together with God
[38:53] ye are God's husbandry ye are God's
[38:58] Building
[39:06] according to the grace of God which is
[39:08] given unto me as a wise master builder I
[39:12] have laid the foundation and another
[39:15] buildeth thereon but let every man take
[39:19] heed how he buildeth there upon
[39:24] for other Foundation can no man lay then
[39:28] that is laid which is Jesus Christ
[39:32] now if any man build upon this
[39:36] Foundation gold silver precious stones
[39:39] wood hay stubble
[39:42] Every Man's work shall be made manifest
[39:45] for the day shall declare it because it
[39:49] shall be revealed by fire
[39:52] and the fire shall try every man's work
[39:55] of what sort it is if any man's work
[39:59] abideth which he hath built thereupon he
[40:04] shall receive a reward if any man's work
[40:07] shall be burned
[40:09] he shall suffer loss but he himself
[40:12] shall be saved yet so as by fire amen
[40:17] you may be seated
[40:19] praise God Alleluia amen
[40:24] we know there's no other Foundation that
[40:26] we must build our experience and build
[40:30] our lives and build our character on
[40:34] there's nothing else as a son or a
[40:37] daughter of God that we should be
[40:39] looking to but Jesus Christ the
[40:41] foundation stone the foundation of our
[40:45] calling the foundation of Revelation in
[40:47] our lives
[40:49] and here we are as individuals living in
[40:52] this day that that God is expecting us
[40:56] to overcome
[40:58] by the character that we build in our
[41:01] experiences
[41:03] we need to recognize that character
[41:05] building is not something that that is
[41:08] built because of our interpretation
[41:11] because of how we feel because of how we
[41:15] we interpret something we must allow the
[41:19] word of God in the spirit of God to
[41:22] interpret all things we must filter it
[41:25] through the word of God Amen praise God
[41:28] when we look at the word character
[41:30] because we're talking about character
[41:32] for the rapture character of his bride
[41:35] listen when God you know when when
[41:38] Abraham sent out Eliezer to look for his
[41:42] son's bride he was looking for character
[41:46] he was looking for something in her and
[41:49] when when he found her there was
[41:51] something in her that was extremely
[41:53] attractive
[41:54] and you know God is attracted to his
[41:58] bride he wants the right kind of
[42:01] character he wants the right kind of
[42:02] experiences he wants us to produce the
[42:06] right kind of Life the right kind of
[42:09] attitude the way we serve him the way we
[42:12] we we we serve one another the way we
[42:16] treat one another the way we respect one
[42:18] another God is looking at that and he's
[42:22] seeing the kind of character that's
[42:24] being built and developed in each and
[42:27] every one of us
[42:28] and so when you look at the word
[42:30] character
[42:31] in the Bible it brings you to the word
[42:34] experience
[42:35] and experience is something that um you
[42:40] know when you look at it it says means
[42:43] the proof or testing of a thing we
[42:46] rejoice in Tribulation because it works
[42:49] out or produces patience while the
[42:52] latter develops and experience with God
[42:56] you see as we go through our trials as
[43:00] we get tested as we deal with the
[43:04] situations that we face as individuals
[43:06] because listen your experience is going
[43:09] to be different from mine
[43:11] you're gonna have to deal with different
[43:13] things depending on where you are in
[43:15] your life
[43:16] depending on your financial situation
[43:19] you might be constantly battling with
[43:22] finance and and so God is dealing
[43:25] through that Finance to build Christian
[43:29] character
[43:30] we don't look at these experiences and
[43:34] try and put our own
[43:36] feelings and interpretations on them
[43:39] because the minute we try to do that we
[43:41] we sometimes make decisions that take us
[43:45] away from God's word
[43:47] all of a sudden somebody's not making
[43:49] enough so they've got to do things that
[43:51] you know that that cause them to leave
[43:54] the word of God
[43:55] so instead of going to church I got to
[43:57] take that extra job
[43:59] and so now they're trusting in their own
[44:01] ability they're trusting in the fact
[44:04] that their experience is producing lack
[44:07] because of their lack of faith
[44:11] listen Revelation in the word of God
[44:14] when you as a son or a daughter of God
[44:16] have Revelation on on tithing and giving
[44:19] and and sowing and reaping into the
[44:23] kingdom of God you should never go
[44:26] without God will always make a way are
[44:30] there going to be times that you're
[44:32] going to be short are there going to be
[44:34] times that you're going to be tested of
[44:36] course why so that God can see and build
[44:41] the kind of character in you that he
[44:44] needs in order to produce a church
[44:46] that's going to stand on the word of God
[44:48] and believe this word for a body change
[44:52] if you can't believe for your you know
[44:54] your everyday simple needs Jesus said I
[44:59] will be with you I'll be in you until
[45:02] the end you're either going to believe
[45:04] God's word or you're not going to
[45:06] believe God's word
[45:07] and so through all of these struggles
[45:10] depending on where you are struggling
[45:13] and where it is that that God is
[45:15] developing a certain aspect of your of
[45:18] your of your uh attribute bringing out a
[45:22] portion of himself through you that
[45:25] character of Christ because we don't
[45:27] want our own characters
[45:30] our characters are are flawed because
[45:33] we're brought up in a world that that
[45:35] that you know shapes people by by
[45:39] experiences of of uh of man's
[45:42] interpretation
[45:43] you know uh here the world is accepting
[45:46] now you know like you think about
[45:48] marriage you know that a lot of
[45:50] marriages are falling apart because of
[45:54] how they feel
[45:56] they put how they feel
[45:59] above how the what the word says you can
[46:03] produce as a son and daughter of God
[46:06] that's married
[46:08] scripturally God is your
[46:12] post god is your typos God is the listen
[46:15] you're gonna have testings in your
[46:16] marriages but when you have a revelation
[46:19] that God is the foundation of your life
[46:23] then God will give you Faith to overcome
[46:26] in the marriage and the circumstances
[46:29] and build the kind of character that you
[46:32] need in order to produce rapturing faith
[46:35] in your life
[46:37] you know people think that you know all
[46:39] Faith you know you got to do great
[46:41] things no you got to learn to do the
[46:43] simple things in order to really receive
[46:46] the Simplicity of God's faith in your
[46:49] life amen praise God
[46:51] and so
[46:53] you know there's a story that comes to
[46:56] mind where you know somebody went to
[46:58] their Pastor it was a woman and she said
[47:00] you know uh Pastor
[47:02] um
[47:04] I'm living with with a husband that is
[47:06] an unbeliever
[47:08] he doesn't believe God's word and I'm
[47:11] I'm tired of it so um what do you think
[47:14] I should do
[47:17] he says well sister he says um
[47:21] the word says that you should stay with
[47:24] him
[47:25] he's constantly calling me he always
[47:28] wants to get back with me but I'm tired
[47:30] of living with with somebody that
[47:33] doesn't believe the word
[47:35] but it's not
[47:37] that
[47:38] it's not that she has the wrong
[47:41] interpretation on the word of God
[47:44] she should be looking to God and looking
[47:47] for the right attitude to the word of
[47:51] God
[47:52] amen praise God here I got a note here
[47:56] on that
[47:58] um
[48:00] so so she says finally I could no longer
[48:03] stand living
[48:04] stand having in common with him the most
[48:07] important thing in my life which is my
[48:10] faith so I let him
[48:11] but he's been calling me daily and
[48:14] begging me to come back what do you
[48:16] think God wants me to do that's easy the
[48:19] Pastor said your husband's lack of
[48:22] Christian faith is no grounds for a
[48:24] divorce according to First Corinthians
[48:26] 7. so God God's will is that you return
[48:30] to him the woman didn't like that answer
[48:33] and said it wasn't it wasn't a good one
[48:36] because I didn't know what what it was
[48:39] like to live with her husband
[48:41] but he responded and said ma'am you did
[48:44] not ask me what I would do if I were in
[48:47] your shoes
[48:49] you perhaps I would have backed out long
[48:52] before you did you see everybody's got
[48:54] their own experience
[48:56] but that's irrelevant to the matter you
[48:58] asked me about the will of God and that
[49:01] is clear in this situation your
[49:04] experience is not a license to disobey
[49:08] the word of God
[49:10] and this is the the whole aspect of our
[49:14] experiences
[49:15] it doesn't give us the right to put the
[49:19] word aside because of how we feel
[49:25] I'm going to read here
[49:30] from the Amplified version
[49:34] of First Corinthians 3
[49:37] verses 9 and there's a few things here
[49:40] that I want to bring out
[49:43] through this teaching tonight on
[49:45] character for the rapture
[49:48] so we know that we are fellow workmen
[49:51] joint promoters laborers together with
[49:55] and for God you are God's garden and
[49:57] Vineyard and field under cultivation you
[50:01] are God's Building
[50:03] God is developing in you
[50:06] and producing in you
[50:09] character
[50:11] he's producing the true church
[50:14] the one that's going to stand in this
[50:16] hour that's going to overcome every
[50:19] situation that's that's coming down on
[50:22] the Earth right now and it's not going
[50:24] to get any better out there
[50:26] it's going to get a lot tougher but God
[50:29] chose you
[50:31] God chose you individually to produce
[50:35] his overcoming power in a in a an age
[50:39] where people are going to fall people
[50:41] are falling to the feelings because a
[50:44] man has feelings for another man
[50:46] it's okay for a man to take another man
[50:49] and and because I feel like
[50:53] I'm a woman
[50:55] then I can act like a woman
[50:58] you see people are building their whole
[51:01] experience here on Earth
[51:03] based on feelings
[51:05] because I feel like you know I just
[51:08] don't love them anymore
[51:11] it's because God is not in their life
[51:14] it's because God is not the foundation
[51:16] of their lives
[51:18] let's read on here
[51:21] now
[51:22] according to the grace the special
[51:25] Endowment for my task of God bestowed on
[51:29] me like a skill for skillful architect
[51:32] and master builder I laid foundation and
[51:36] now another man is building upon it but
[51:39] let each man be careful how he builds
[51:42] upon it
[51:43] for no other Foundation can anyone lay
[51:46] than that which is already laid which is
[51:49] Christ Jesus the anointed one but if
[51:52] anyone builds upon the foundation
[51:54] whether it be with gold
[51:57] silver precious stones
[52:00] wood hay straw now look look at look at
[52:04] those things because these are just
[52:06] examples and and they're using materials
[52:11] on what we're building our lives on what
[52:14] we're building our experiences on and
[52:17] there's going to be some things that we
[52:18] build on which are like like gold gold
[52:22] can be tried gold is is precious gold
[52:25] stands the test of of you can burn gold
[52:28] all you want
[52:30] but it's still gold Hallelujah and if
[52:34] you're an attribute of God no matter
[52:36] what trial comes your way no matter what
[52:38] test comes your way no matter how hard
[52:41] it gets God's Gonna Give You a character
[52:44] to overcome
[52:46] you will be an overcomer because your
[52:49] foundation is built on the word of God
[52:51] that that that that you're not mixing
[52:53] with anything else
[52:55] but if you're building if you're
[52:57] building your experience on on you know
[53:00] uh well I I I uh I haven't done anything
[53:04] bad in my life
[53:06] I'm I'm a good person I don't you know I
[53:09] don't do this I don't do that you're
[53:11] building your experience and you're
[53:14] building your um you're trying to uh
[53:17] acknowledge that your experience in
[53:20] Christ can be just on the fact that
[53:22] you're a good person
[53:24] it goes beyond being a good person
[53:27] it goes It goes into into aspects of a
[53:31] walk with God that you will be tried and
[53:34] tested like never before only for the
[53:37] purpose that God can bring out in you
[53:39] what's truly in you as a son or daughter
[53:42] of God
[53:43] verse 13 it says the work of each one
[53:47] will be complainely openly known shown
[53:51] for what it is for the day of Christ
[53:54] will disclose and declare it because it
[53:58] will be revealed with fire and the fire
[54:01] will test and critically appraise the
[54:04] character
[54:06] and worth of the work each person has
[54:10] done
[54:12] you will get tested and you will
[54:16] it will show in you what's really there
[54:23] you'll fight
[54:24] you'll you'll you'll fight situations in
[54:27] your life you'll you'll deal with
[54:29] circumstances that you think you can't
[54:31] overcome with you can't overcome but
[54:35] there's something in you that will
[54:37] because you've built your experience on
[54:40] the revelation of this word on the Rock
[54:43] Revelation you will overcome you will be
[54:46] able to deal with the circumstances you
[54:49] will continue to grow in Christ you will
[54:53] produce the supernatural in your life as
[54:57] you walk with God because you've allowed
[54:59] Christ to test you if the work which any
[55:03] person has built on this Foundation any
[55:07] product of his efforts whatsoever
[55:09] survive this test he will get a reward
[55:14] you will receive your reward if you
[55:17] continue to overcome
[55:20] you see one thing that it says
[55:24] about this bride
[55:26] in order to sit with Christ in his
[55:28] throne is that you need to overcome
[55:31] a lot of people say well God is going to
[55:34] do it
[55:35] yeah God's going to do it because you've
[55:37] got a revelation that God can do it
[55:41] not because you're just going to sit
[55:44] back and let God do everything in your
[55:46] life
[55:47] God has a plan for you but God also
[55:50] wants you to recognize your position
[55:52] your part in the word your your part in
[55:56] the ministry God wants you to get into
[55:58] your position as a son or a daughter of
[56:01] God so that you can so that you can know
[56:03] yourself
[56:05] what's in you what's designed and
[56:09] prepared in you in order to produce this
[56:12] rapturing grace in your life
[56:15] amen praise God hallelujah
[56:19] and so but if any person's work is
[56:22] burned up under the test he will suffer
[56:25] the loss
[56:26] of it all losing his reward
[56:30] though he himself will be saved but only
[56:34] as one who has passed through the fire
[56:38] hahaha
[56:39] you know there's there's going to be
[56:42] rewards to those
[56:43] that stood in their position
[56:46] if you as a son or a daughter of God are
[56:49] a son or daughter of God attribute of
[56:52] God you can't be lost
[56:55] there's nothing that's going to change
[56:56] your destination those whose names were
[56:59] written in the Lamb's Book of Life was
[57:01] from before the foundations of the world
[57:03] there's nothing that can change your
[57:06] destination as a son or a daughter
[57:09] attribute of God
[57:10] but you can lose Victory right here
[57:15] and you can lose some rewards because
[57:18] when we go beyond this curtain of time
[57:21] God will have called you to a certain
[57:23] aspect to a certain position in the word
[57:26] of God and you you might have been lazy
[57:29] you weren't willing to you know to to
[57:30] give your all you weren't willing to to
[57:33] give all of yourself you know when when
[57:36] when God blessed you financially the
[57:39] first thing you did was you thought
[57:40] about what what what what can I get for
[57:44] myself
[57:45] instead of putting God first
[57:49] you see we can get distracted by this
[57:51] world we're constantly being bombarded
[57:54] about getting more that's what Leo decia
[57:58] was all about riched increased in Goods
[58:01] in need of nothing always looking to to
[58:04] get more but to to go for more without
[58:07] Christ is is less
[58:10] you you lose everything
[58:13] without Christ
[58:14] hallelujah praise God Amen
[58:20] so our teacher
[58:22] in every test
[58:24] whether it be a bad experience good
[58:27] experience let it be through God's word
[58:31] don't listen to anything that you're
[58:34] gonna you're gonna face trials don't
[58:36] listen to anything that's going to pull
[58:37] you away from the word of God
[58:40] don't allow those those things that seem
[58:43] well oh well I can do that I guess you
[58:45] know
[58:46] um
[58:47] doesn't matter if I do it this way or
[58:49] that way
[58:50] meanwhile
[58:51] you know that it's not according to the
[58:54] word of God
[58:56] you got to allow the word of God to be
[58:58] your foundation otherwise you're going
[59:01] to build on wood you're going to build
[59:03] on Hay
[59:05] you know what happens to Wood and hey
[59:07] when it gets into a fire
[59:10] God you got no power whatsoever you got
[59:14] no overcoming power you got no Victory
[59:16] whatsoever but if you've built it on on
[59:19] solid Stone on the solid foundation of
[59:23] God's word allow the word of God to do
[59:25] and to and to uh shape you and mold you
[59:30] in whatever way God wants to mold you
[59:32] and shape you then that will stand and
[59:34] that's why you're able to stand in this
[59:36] day and in this hour you know the world
[59:38] is going through a burning right now
[59:41] this whole world is being tested like
[59:43] never before remember the Great
[59:46] Tribulation it's slowly creeping in
[59:49] and it's creeping in on the people in
[59:51] such a way that they think everything is
[59:53] fine it's like a frog you put a frog in
[59:55] the middle of a pot and you know you
[59:57] just start to warm it up you start to
[59:59] warm up the water and the Frog is
[1:00:01] feeling really good and you know he's
[1:00:03] thinking that everything's okay and
[1:00:04] before you know it somebody's having
[1:00:06] frog legs for dinner
[1:00:08] right okay well you don't want to allow
[1:00:12] your your your experience to be
[1:00:14] controlled in that way you don't want to
[1:00:17] uh you got to realize what's going on
[1:00:19] around you you need to realize that God
[1:00:22] is is calling a church God is shaping a
[1:00:25] people God is perfecting you testing you
[1:00:28] trying you don't don't be afraid of the
[1:00:31] of the trials and the and the
[1:00:34] tribulations amen but just allow the
[1:00:37] word to be your foundation we don't want
[1:00:40] to we don't want to have a repeat of
[1:00:42] what happened back in the Garden of Eden
[1:00:44] where you know where Satan came and said
[1:00:47] oh you know this tree is good you know
[1:00:51] it's good for you it's going to make you
[1:00:52] feel good it's good you know he gave her
[1:00:54] all the experience physically and she
[1:00:58] bought into it and and what did it cause
[1:01:00] it caused the greatest fall
[1:01:02] amen praise God simple so don't allow
[1:01:07] feelings to be how you interpret your
[1:01:11] experiences and how you build your
[1:01:13] experiences let the word of God Be Your
[1:01:17] Foundation let that be what you build it
[1:01:20] upon Allelujah
[1:01:23] praise God
[1:01:25] human wisdom
[1:01:27] fleshly attractions
[1:01:29] they may have a place in your life but
[1:01:32] not in the building of the church
[1:01:35] we're building the church upon this
[1:01:38] church is being built upon Jesus Christ
[1:01:40] nothing changes when you're out there
[1:01:43] and you're talking to people oh I'm a
[1:01:45] Christian you know ask them how are you
[1:01:47] baptized
[1:01:49] have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:01:52] what do you mean well how are you
[1:01:54] baptized
[1:01:56] well I was baptized as a baby well
[1:01:57] babies don't
[1:01:59] believe
[1:02:01] maybe it's just say Google Gaga and cry
[1:02:04] and they want to be fed
[1:02:07] how can a baby possibly know
[1:02:10] the Bible says clearly repent be
[1:02:12] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:15] Christ you shall receive the gift of the
[1:02:19] Holy Ghost
[1:02:20] and the Holy Ghost is what interprets
[1:02:22] the word and the Holy Ghost is what
[1:02:25] gives you an experience as a Christian
[1:02:28] you can't even claim to be a Christian
[1:02:30] unless you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:02:33] the only way you can be a Christian is
[1:02:35] if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:02:38] it can't be on
[1:02:41] fleshly wisdom there's no way that this
[1:02:44] church is going to be oh will you come
[1:02:46] to our church it's full every Sunday we
[1:02:49] got the best musicians we got the best
[1:02:52] singers we've got the best programs
[1:02:55] we've got marriage counseling we've got
[1:02:57] children's counseling we've got all the
[1:03:00] they've got the the finest men's wisdom
[1:03:04] in men's teachings on things that that
[1:03:06] you know that that could make us look
[1:03:09] like we're just a small little church
[1:03:10] here you know but but we've got
[1:03:14] something that they haven't got
[1:03:16] Hallelujah and that is the Holy Ghost
[1:03:18] the power of God to to deliver you as an
[1:03:22] individual to give you overcoming power
[1:03:24] to declare himself in you Christ in you
[1:03:28] your hope of glory
[1:03:30] you have something that that the rest of
[1:03:34] this world
[1:03:35] you know once in a while I start to
[1:03:37] think and I say oh God what Grace
[1:03:41] what Grace that you that you chose a
[1:03:44] vessel like this
[1:03:46] I'm still weak I'm still frail I'm still
[1:03:49] like anybody else susceptible to
[1:03:52] sickness susceptible to to uh being
[1:03:55] tired you're still human
[1:03:58] but there's a revelation that that God
[1:04:01] placed in our hearts that that that is
[1:04:04] beyond our understanding it goes beyond
[1:04:07] our ability goes beyond our experiences
[1:04:10] goes beyond our mistakes are you gonna
[1:04:12] still make mistakes of course you're
[1:04:15] going to make mistakes you're a human
[1:04:18] there's nothing perfect but Christ
[1:04:22] hallelujah praise God
[1:04:26] you know
[1:04:28] um
[1:04:29] you can't weigh your your you know it
[1:04:32] was it was Moody that said wisely he
[1:04:35] said that converts ought to be weighed
[1:04:37] as well as counted people look at just
[1:04:41] adding to the church oh well we can
[1:04:43] build a bigger church we need to build
[1:04:45] we need to get more people in the church
[1:04:47] because they want numbers
[1:04:50] but they need to be weighed they need to
[1:04:52] be checked they need to be tested they
[1:04:54] need to be tried when somebody comes
[1:04:56] into the household of faith then the
[1:04:59] word of God starts to purge their life
[1:05:01] starts to try them test them
[1:05:04] see what's really in there you know you
[1:05:07] don't know what's in you I didn't know
[1:05:09] what was in me when God called me 30
[1:05:11] years ago I had no idea
[1:05:13] that he was gonna place you know Place
[1:05:17] me into the ministry to to serve as a
[1:05:21] deacon and and and and to be a part of a
[1:05:24] Ministry to to help grow a Ministry to
[1:05:26] to to no idea that this was actually
[1:05:31] inside but that was not me that was the
[1:05:36] attribute that was God's plan that was
[1:05:39] God's purpose when God places you in the
[1:05:42] body of Christ he saw your position
[1:05:45] before you even were born
[1:05:49] Hallelujah God saw Daniel playing the
[1:05:52] drums
[1:05:53] he saw that he would be faithful at
[1:05:55] playing the drums you think that's not a
[1:05:58] position in the body of Christ it's a
[1:06:00] position in the body of Christ
[1:06:02] can rapturing Faith be be developed by
[1:06:06] Michelle playing the piano you better
[1:06:08] believe it
[1:06:09] because if she's doing it by faith and
[1:06:11] she understands that that that that she
[1:06:14] can be anointed of God to put music out
[1:06:17] into the into the ears of the people
[1:06:19] because of her consecration her prayer
[1:06:22] his desire his prayer his desire to to
[1:06:26] to to to to edify the body of Christ it
[1:06:31] will do it
[1:06:32] it will produce faith and you will see
[1:06:36] the supernatural working through your
[1:06:39] individual lives
[1:06:42] you will know that oh I'm not just a
[1:06:44] drummer in the church
[1:06:46] God has something greater for me because
[1:06:49] I'm I'm receiving all this Revelation on
[1:06:51] the word of God
[1:06:53] I can't believe that I'm seeing what
[1:06:56] he's saying
[1:06:57] I'm hearing the word and I'm recognizing
[1:07:00] the word why because the attribute in
[1:07:04] you was ordained from before the
[1:07:06] foundations of the world to overcome
[1:07:10] to build a character to be placed in the
[1:07:13] body for the purpose of God so that he
[1:07:16] can take his bride
[1:07:20] the body's got to come together
[1:07:23] all that the father hath given me will
[1:07:26] come he didn't say might
[1:07:29] so every attribute that belongs to this
[1:07:32] ministry
[1:07:33] must come
[1:07:35] there's nothing that is going to stop
[1:07:37] them from coming
[1:07:38] why how do I know that because I came
[1:07:42] because you came
[1:07:44] because you you didn't choose to come
[1:07:47] you didn't choose to be a part of this
[1:07:49] it's because God saw you from before the
[1:07:53] foundations of The World God had a plan
[1:07:55] for you God knew that you would have to
[1:07:57] face laodicea God knew that you would
[1:08:00] have to face the most wicked most
[1:08:02] deceiving age but he also placed in you
[1:08:05] the ability to overcome and produce
[1:08:08] exactly what he requires so that you can
[1:08:11] edify the body so that you can you you
[1:08:14] can be a strength in the house of the
[1:08:16] Lord
[1:08:17] you can you you can allow the Holy
[1:08:19] Spirit to use you in in the small simple
[1:08:23] way that God wants to use you when you
[1:08:25] surrender to God you allow the spirit of
[1:08:28] God to use you in the simplest ways
[1:08:31] don't don't don't
[1:08:33] let those thoughts that come to you oh
[1:08:36] you know what go to the church and and
[1:08:39] and do some Landscaping at the church
[1:08:43] go and and do some
[1:08:46] uh cleaning at the church
[1:08:49] you might think well that's
[1:08:51] you know oh okay
[1:08:53] don't put that aside
[1:08:55] that's God speaking to you in simplicity
[1:09:00] God wants to see how obedient you are to
[1:09:03] him
[1:09:04] so he'll give you the simplest little
[1:09:06] things to do from time to time you might
[1:09:09] think it's simple when you vacuum the
[1:09:11] sanctuary every Sunday there brother
[1:09:13] Eugene but let me tell you something
[1:09:15] that's God
[1:09:17] that's the anointing of God upon his
[1:09:20] life he's recognizing his position in
[1:09:22] the word of God and he's Allowing God to
[1:09:25] do it and God will vindicate and show
[1:09:28] him by Revelation the simplest Little
[1:09:31] Things
[1:09:32] and then when a trial comes
[1:09:35] when a trial comes God God does not
[1:09:38] forget
[1:09:40] what you're what you've built your
[1:09:42] experience on
[1:09:45] God God God
[1:09:46] knows that that you overcame that Spirit
[1:09:49] of laziness
[1:09:51] so that you could do things in the house
[1:09:53] of the Lord that you could you you you
[1:09:55] overcame that that that feeling of well
[1:09:58] I don't just don't feel like it
[1:10:02] but because you overcame that
[1:10:04] an element of the supernatural starts to
[1:10:07] move around your life
[1:10:09] that's why you can you you can see
[1:10:12] people go through great trials
[1:10:16] and then two three weeks later
[1:10:19] they're standing just as strong as they
[1:10:21] ever did
[1:10:23] what is that
[1:10:25] what is that but then there's some that
[1:10:27] when the fiery trial comes because it
[1:10:29] wasn't built on the foundation of the
[1:10:32] word by the revelation of God's word
[1:10:34] God's testing God's trying God's God's
[1:10:38] pushing and and pulling in the constant
[1:10:40] battles that that we have to overcome
[1:10:43] the greatest battles that we constantly
[1:10:45] overcome
[1:10:46] because of that that that that that you
[1:10:49] know like it's like
[1:10:51] it's a simple things that we do
[1:10:53] sometimes that we think you know it
[1:10:56] doesn't matter but it does when you do
[1:10:58] those simple things of being consistent
[1:11:01] in your position when you're consistent
[1:11:03] in your position the supernatural comes
[1:11:07] when you need it
[1:11:09] it just it's there
[1:11:11] all of a sudden you're doing something
[1:11:13] you know God showed you you know God LED
[1:11:16] you in this way but then you you know
[1:11:18] you you face a barrier you face a test
[1:11:22] don't fear
[1:11:24] greater is he that is in you than he
[1:11:27] that is in this world
[1:11:29] God will make a way for you God will
[1:11:31] overcome that situation
[1:11:34] because of the simple obedience to the
[1:11:37] word of God
[1:11:40] glory to God Amen
[1:11:43] thank you Jesus
[1:11:45] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:11:48] I want to read a quote here
[1:11:55] it's from the laodicean church age
[1:11:58] we're going to slowly wind down here
[1:12:01] you had better come before it's too late
[1:12:03] saith the Lord and by of me gold tried
[1:12:07] in the fire and then you will be truly
[1:12:11] rich
[1:12:12] are we getting it
[1:12:14] listen to me naked physically we came
[1:12:17] into the world but naked spiritually we
[1:12:21] will not leave
[1:12:24] oh no we are going to take something
[1:12:27] with us
[1:12:30] but I thought you know you don't take
[1:12:33] nothing with you
[1:12:35] you don't realize that you're just being
[1:12:37] molded and shaped
[1:12:39] and and and a character is being
[1:12:41] developed in you
[1:12:43] because you do have free moral agency
[1:12:45] remember that
[1:12:46] a lot of people well praise God I'll
[1:12:48] just leave it with the Lord
[1:12:52] I didn't go to work this week I didn't
[1:12:53] feel like it
[1:12:56] got up late couple times and you know I
[1:12:58] just decided I wouldn't go
[1:13:01] and then you lose your job oh well
[1:13:03] praise God I'll let the Lord provide me
[1:13:05] a new job
[1:13:08] no no you need to have common sense in
[1:13:11] everything that you do God is giving you
[1:13:14] wisdom
[1:13:15] remember experience
[1:13:18] when experience after experience after
[1:13:21] experience
[1:13:22] takes place and you face certain trials
[1:13:26] over and over and over again
[1:13:30] we trust that you will gain some wisdom
[1:13:33] to know what to do with the word
[1:13:36] to know how you can bring Victory into
[1:13:40] your life by doing certain things
[1:13:44] he says what is that something is is all
[1:13:48] we can take with us nothing less and
[1:13:50] nothing more so we had better be real
[1:13:54] careful now to see what we take
[1:13:57] something that will make us right before
[1:13:59] God so then what will we take with us we
[1:14:04] will take our character brother
[1:14:07] that is what we will take with us now
[1:14:10] what kind of character will you take
[1:14:13] with you
[1:14:14] will it be his like his whose character
[1:14:18] was molded by suffering in a fiery
[1:14:22] furnace of affliction
[1:14:24] or will it be the softness of this
[1:14:27] characterless laodicean people
[1:14:30] it is up to each one of us for in that
[1:14:33] day every man will bear his own burden
[1:14:39] you are being developed right now
[1:14:42] to have the character of Christ
[1:14:47] you are being developed right now to
[1:14:50] produce Supernatural
[1:14:53] faith and there's only one way that
[1:14:55] you're going to produce that is when you
[1:14:56] recognize
[1:14:58] when you hear and you act upon the word
[1:15:02] of God
[1:15:03] when God reveals to you simply and I'm
[1:15:06] talking this is a personal walk eh
[1:15:10] this is not a a you know
[1:15:13] a group
[1:15:15] discussion over here yeah we're having a
[1:15:17] group discussion but God is speaking to
[1:15:20] individuals here tonight
[1:15:22] that's how this works
[1:15:25] you know it's not it's not a a message
[1:15:28] you know I wasn't led to bring a message
[1:15:30] on oh the open you know the word and the
[1:15:32] Seven Seals and this and that no the
[1:15:34] Lord led me to this message because he's
[1:15:37] working and molding my character right
[1:15:39] now
[1:15:42] and God is dealing with situations in my
[1:15:45] life in order to produce certain
[1:15:47] characteristics so that I can fulfill my
[1:15:50] position in the word of God
[1:15:52] and that's what God is doing he's he's
[1:15:54] preparing and developing character
[1:15:57] within us because when you've got the
[1:16:00] right character you're able to rule over
[1:16:03] your own life
[1:16:05] and then rule over the situations that
[1:16:07] you have to face
[1:16:09] as an individual here on this Earth
[1:16:13] listen here
[1:16:15] we're going to read one more
[1:16:17] quote from Brother Branham
[1:16:19] and it's from
[1:16:22] from the seven Church ages again
[1:16:24] the Sumerian Church age in Hebrews 5 8 9
[1:16:29] I was talking about Christ
[1:16:31] though he were a son yet learned he
[1:16:33] obedience by the things which he
[1:16:35] suffered can you imagine the word was
[1:16:39] made flesh dwelt Among Us
[1:16:41] but yet he had to learn obedience
[1:16:45] in order to fulfill his part in the word
[1:16:47] of God
[1:16:49] so if the Creator himself
[1:16:53] comes down to the Earth and has to come
[1:16:55] under obedience
[1:16:57] to God's word which was his own word
[1:16:59] because God cannot lie God had to God
[1:17:03] sent forth his word God said that that
[1:17:05] that there would have to be a sacrifice
[1:17:08] the Lamb of God that would take away the
[1:17:10] sins of the world but he came as a he
[1:17:14] came as God in a human vessel in it and
[1:17:17] the human vessel
[1:17:19] he had to learn obedience to deal with
[1:17:22] this human vessel he had to overcome the
[1:17:25] humanity the character of this human
[1:17:28] vessel that is always trying to look for
[1:17:30] the easy way
[1:17:33] everybody's like that
[1:17:35] everybody's always looking for the easy
[1:17:37] way out
[1:17:38] everybody's got an excuse why this why
[1:17:41] that
[1:17:42] excuses those are your excuses
[1:17:45] those are human excuses
[1:17:48] that's not God
[1:17:49] can do all things I can do all things
[1:17:53] through Christ
[1:17:55] the Bible says all things are possible
[1:17:58] to them that believe the reason why you
[1:18:01] see a situation in your life and you
[1:18:03] think it's impossible is because you
[1:18:06] don't believe
[1:18:08] it's as simple as that
[1:18:10] I don't care what the situation is I
[1:18:13] don't care what the doctor's report is
[1:18:15] he's still the Lord God that healeth all
[1:18:18] of your diseases I don't care what your
[1:18:20] diseases are
[1:18:22] people want to make excuses for their
[1:18:24] for their diseases for their for their
[1:18:27] for their uh you know weaknesses in the
[1:18:29] flesh we all got them
[1:18:31] but Christ is still my healer
[1:18:35] I may not be fully healed right now
[1:18:39] but he's still my healer
[1:18:41] and I'm going to still I I still claim
[1:18:44] the word of God that he is the Lord God
[1:18:46] that healeth all my diseases and I'm not
[1:18:49] gonna I'm not gonna I'm not gonna step
[1:18:51] back from that I don't care what devil
[1:18:53] stands in front of me and says you got
[1:18:56] this you got that yeah I my God you
[1:18:59] listen to some people I got this problem
[1:19:01] got that problem I got this I got that I
[1:19:03] got this from my father I got this from
[1:19:05] my mother
[1:19:08] what in the world is that that's not
[1:19:11] faith
[1:19:13] I got the Lord Jesus greater is he that
[1:19:16] is in me than he that is in this world I
[1:19:19] don't care what the doctor's report is
[1:19:22] I'm believing the word of God
[1:19:24] I'm standing on the word of God I'm
[1:19:27] going to keep walking with God if if
[1:19:29] listen if I'm going to burn out I might
[1:19:31] as well burn out for Christ
[1:19:33] if my time and your time is up you can't
[1:19:36] stop it
[1:19:38] to everything there is a time and a
[1:19:41] season
[1:19:43] and Jesus Christ knew his time and his
[1:19:47] season and because he knew his time in
[1:19:50] his season he could stand by Perfect
[1:19:52] faith when he stood there and he says
[1:19:54] you tear down this Tabernacle in three
[1:19:58] days I'll raise it up again
[1:20:00] he had a revelation of who he was he
[1:20:04] knew what he was called to produce he
[1:20:06] knew what God had placed in him to
[1:20:10] fulfill and so he learned obedience by
[1:20:13] the things that he suffered he had to
[1:20:15] suffer
[1:20:17] and being made perfect he became the
[1:20:19] author
[1:20:20] now the author of Eternal salvation
[1:20:23] what's he talking about there he's going
[1:20:26] to bring the Eternal attributes of God
[1:20:28] he's going to return them he's going to
[1:20:31] save them he's going to redeem them he
[1:20:33] was the author of Eternal salvation
[1:20:36] so if you're an attribute of God you can
[1:20:39] never be lost
[1:20:40] you can never sin as an attribute of God
[1:20:43] this can sin but the attribute will
[1:20:46] never sin Hallelujah he became the
[1:20:49] author of Eternal salvation unto all
[1:20:52] them
[1:20:53] now listen that obey him
[1:20:56] that obey him
[1:20:58] simply obey simply let the holy spirit
[1:21:02] guide you in simple ways do the things
[1:21:05] that you know as a as a a member of this
[1:21:09] church if God has placed you in this
[1:21:11] church he's got a purpose in placing you
[1:21:14] in this church
[1:21:15] so fulfill the purpose and the and the
[1:21:19] things that God has shown you to do keep
[1:21:21] it simple allow him in plain language
[1:21:23] the very character of Jesus was
[1:21:26] perfected by suffering and according to
[1:21:30] Paul he has left his church a measure of
[1:21:33] suffering that they too by their faith
[1:21:36] in God while suffering for him would
[1:21:41] come to a place of perfection
[1:21:44] so when you're tested in the fire when
[1:21:46] you're tested at work when you're tested
[1:21:49] with the doctor's report when you're
[1:21:51] tested with a poor relationship with
[1:21:53] somebody
[1:21:54] just let the the word of God be the
[1:21:57] foundation of that test and know that
[1:22:00] God will make a way for you
[1:22:03] he's already made a way for you
[1:22:05] otherwise he he'd be a liar
[1:22:08] he says my word shall not return unto me
[1:22:11] void all that you've been given to
[1:22:13] produce all that you are you will
[1:22:16] produce it you will fulfill it you will
[1:22:18] overcome the the battles of this life
[1:22:21] and you will have a character that will
[1:22:23] shine before God Amen Hallelujah
[1:22:26] according to Paul he's left a measure of
[1:22:29] suffering and would come to a place of
[1:22:31] perfection why why did he want this
[1:22:34] James 1 2-4 my brother encountered all
[1:22:39] joy
[1:22:41] you know sometimes
[1:22:43] it's not easy
[1:22:45] to be joyful when you're in the middle
[1:22:47] of a trial
[1:22:50] it's not
[1:22:52] when you're sick in bed or when you're
[1:22:54] feeling the pain or when when somebody's
[1:22:56] really hurt you
[1:22:59] but that's where the word comes right up
[1:23:02] in you
[1:23:03] it'll it'll it'll just raise up in you
[1:23:06] and it'll say count up Joy
[1:23:08] count it all joy when you face and fall
[1:23:11] into diverse Temptations knowing this
[1:23:14] that the trying of your faith God is
[1:23:17] testing your revelation God is testing
[1:23:20] your testimony
[1:23:25] God is testing to see whether you truly
[1:23:27] believe your own personal testimony
[1:23:31] Hallelujah
[1:23:33] and knowing this that the Trine of your
[1:23:35] faith worketh patience but let patience
[1:23:37] have her perfect work that ye made
[1:23:39] perfect may be perfect and entire
[1:23:41] wanting nothing now why does he stand by
[1:23:45] the reason is in Romans 8 17 18 God will
[1:23:51] always be there
[1:23:52] remember don't worry about the the trial
[1:23:57] trust God in the trial trust God that
[1:24:00] he's building character in you
[1:24:02] Romans 8 17 and 18 and if children then
[1:24:06] heirs
[1:24:07] Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ
[1:24:09] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:24:13] may be also glorified together
[1:24:16] you see it's the body of Christ right
[1:24:18] now the greatest
[1:24:20] test that's going on in the world is
[1:24:24] within the body of Jesus Christ
[1:24:26] the world is going through its prophecy
[1:24:29] but that's the world
[1:24:31] but the bride she's got to produce
[1:24:33] rapturing faith in her life
[1:24:36] the only way she's going to do that is
[1:24:38] when she can recognize who she is in the
[1:24:40] word that she's actually the word in her
[1:24:43] day being tried being tested being
[1:24:45] molded being shaped so that it will
[1:24:48] produce the rapture
[1:24:50] that's the outcome of your trying and
[1:24:52] your testing
[1:24:54] Christ's victory was going to the Cross
[1:24:56] all the all the trying and all the
[1:24:59] testing and everything else brought the
[1:25:01] greatest Victory to you and me
[1:25:03] he knew what he had to do he knew what
[1:25:06] he had to overcome and we must know that
[1:25:09] we've got a
[1:25:11] our lives are not ours anymore
[1:25:14] our life is lost in Christ
[1:25:18] we gotta give it all so listen here he
[1:25:20] goes on
[1:25:21] so and if children then heirs Heirs of
[1:25:24] God and Joint heirs with Christ
[1:25:26] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:25:30] may also be glorified together for I
[1:25:32] reckon that the suffering of this
[1:25:35] present time
[1:25:37] the sufferings of this present time I
[1:25:41] don't know what you're going through
[1:25:42] tonight I don't know what you're dealing
[1:25:44] with I don't know I know what I'm
[1:25:46] dealing with I know the situations that
[1:25:48] I gotta deal with in my life you need to
[1:25:50] know whatever it is that that you're
[1:25:52] dealing with but I need you to bring it
[1:25:53] to the Forefront right now because I've
[1:25:56] got a word of God for you right now
[1:25:58] that's gonna that's gonna give you
[1:25:59] something Hallelujah unless we suffer
[1:26:02] with him we cannot reign with him
[1:26:05] you have to suffer to Reign the reason
[1:26:08] for this is that character simply is
[1:26:12] never made without suffering
[1:26:17] you can never make it without suffering
[1:26:19] character is a victory it's not a gift
[1:26:23] God just doesn't give you his character
[1:26:28] God brings out his character in you as
[1:26:33] you overcome
[1:26:35] as you overcome the situations in your
[1:26:37] life
[1:26:38] how you how you
[1:26:40] communicate
[1:26:42] your attitude shows exactly where your
[1:26:45] altitude is in Christ
[1:26:49] if you're the kind of person that's got
[1:26:50] always got a negative attitude
[1:26:52] everything's oh yeah the weather's
[1:26:54] terrible today
[1:26:57] what about the nice weather that's
[1:26:59] coming this weekend
[1:27:02] I'm dealing with weather right now
[1:27:05] for the last week and a half you know in
[1:27:07] in in the garden center business all the
[1:27:10] guys that are running and operating
[1:27:11] Garden Center businesses they're all
[1:27:13] crying the blues because the weather's
[1:27:15] been terrible
[1:27:17] but guess what
[1:27:19] the sun is coming
[1:27:21] Hallelujah the sun is on the way glory
[1:27:24] to God so you have to suffer Victory is
[1:27:27] not a gift a man without character can't
[1:27:30] Reign because power apart from character
[1:27:33] is satanic
[1:27:36] you try to gain in this world and you
[1:27:39] try to and all you're thinking about is
[1:27:41] gain gain gain the more I can gain the
[1:27:44] more I can have I need this and I I want
[1:27:46] a bigger house I want to be gain gain
[1:27:49] gain it it's that's that's gonna produce
[1:27:52] a character of greed
[1:27:56] sheep
[1:27:57] I know multi-millionaires that are cheap
[1:28:02] they they they could burn money
[1:28:06] but yet they're cheap they don't want to
[1:28:08] give they don't want to let go they
[1:28:10] think that it's mine I worked for it I
[1:28:12] made it and they're not willing to let
[1:28:15] go
[1:28:16] it shows the kind of character that's
[1:28:18] really there they don't have an
[1:28:19] understanding that
[1:28:21] God owns it all
[1:28:24] he gives and he takes
[1:28:27] if he wants to give blessed be his name
[1:28:29] if he wants to take blessed be his name
[1:28:32] that's God's prerogative that's God's
[1:28:34] way
[1:28:35] but Power with character is fit to rule
[1:28:39] you know that God is perfect why do I
[1:28:41] gotta build character brother you know
[1:28:43] what do I need all this character for
[1:28:45] because we're not done
[1:28:48] once we go we go for three and a half
[1:28:50] years but we got to come back and Rule
[1:28:53] we need to come back with Christ here on
[1:28:56] this Earth for another Thousand Years
[1:28:58] yep
[1:29:00] yep another Thousand Years
[1:29:03] imagine this Earth still got another
[1:29:05] thousand years before the new heavens
[1:29:08] and the new Earth according to the word
[1:29:09] of God
[1:29:11] it's that that's that's God's plan
[1:29:14] for this Earth
[1:29:15] and for us
[1:29:17] if it wasn't he wouldn't have sent his
[1:29:19] word
[1:29:20] that's why you know you talk to people
[1:29:23] and they're they're telling you about
[1:29:24] dinosaurs a million years ago they're
[1:29:26] telling you about you know galaxies and
[1:29:28] universes and everything else but they
[1:29:30] but they failed to recognize yeah but
[1:29:31] you know what God has a plan right here
[1:29:33] right now for you and me
[1:29:35] we need to focus on that and right now
[1:29:38] God is building character in you and me
[1:29:41] so that we can be fit to rule in the
[1:29:43] millennium
[1:29:45] let the musicians come and since he
[1:29:47] wants us to share listen since he wants
[1:29:51] us to share even his throne on the same
[1:29:55] basis that he overcame and is set down
[1:29:58] in his father's Throne then we have to
[1:30:01] overcome to sit with him
[1:30:06] and the little temporary suffering we go
[1:30:09] through now is not worthy to be compared
[1:30:13] to the tremendous Glory that will be
[1:30:16] revealed in US
[1:30:18] when he comes
[1:30:20] oh what Treasures are laid up for those
[1:30:23] who are willing to enter into his
[1:30:25] kingdom through much tribulation
[1:30:29] thinking not strange concerning the
[1:30:32] fiery trials
[1:30:34] that are to try you
[1:30:36] that is what Peter said it is strange
[1:30:39] that God wants us to develop a
[1:30:42] christ-like character that comes through
[1:30:45] suffering
[1:30:46] no sir and we all have trials we all
[1:30:50] have tried
[1:30:52] we are all tried and chastened as Sons
[1:30:55] no one but goes through that
[1:31:00] glory to God
[1:31:02] bless you Saints I trust that tonight
[1:31:06] there was something that
[1:31:08] you know
[1:31:10] stirred within your heart got you to
[1:31:13] look a little deeper into your
[1:31:15] life
[1:31:17] give you a little bit of clarity and a
[1:31:20] little bit of light on why God you know
[1:31:22] if you if you're facing the same trial
[1:31:24] over and over and over again
[1:31:28] there's a message there
[1:31:31] there's something there that God wants
[1:31:34] you to overcome
[1:31:38] it's not that very trial that you're
[1:31:40] facing
[1:31:42] it's something in your character
[1:31:44] it's your attitude
[1:31:47] it's the way you deal
[1:31:49] and so God uses the boss God uses
[1:31:55] the rebellious child
[1:31:57] God uses a little bit of sickness
[1:32:00] so that he can get you back into
[1:32:02] obedience and into a into in into into a
[1:32:06] place where you can be consistent with
[1:32:08] God and not one day you're way out on
[1:32:10] left field the next day you're way over
[1:32:12] there
[1:32:13] you know people people we need to we
[1:32:17] need to stay down the middle of the road
[1:32:20] we need to find a balance in our walk
[1:32:22] with God
[1:32:23] and sometimes God uses the simple things
[1:32:26] in our lives to bring us back into
[1:32:28] balance so that our character can be
[1:32:32] reflecting him and not our own ideas our
[1:32:38] own
[1:32:39] outbursts our own attitudes
[1:32:42] you know that's why you got to stay away
[1:32:44] from getting caught up
[1:32:45] with these you know uh people that are
[1:32:48] that are like uh you know
[1:32:50] rebellious against the government
[1:32:52] rebellious against this Rebellion oh
[1:32:54] they're taking this away from us they're
[1:32:56] taking that away from us
[1:32:58] that's not who you are
[1:33:00] you're not a part of that economy
[1:33:04] you are in God's economy
[1:33:06] God has a purpose and a plan for your
[1:33:09] life your economy is perfectly fine
[1:33:13] because you've got the greatest
[1:33:16] president
[1:33:17] director boss ruler healer doctor you've
[1:33:22] got it all in Christ Jesus
[1:33:24] you need to stay right there and just
[1:33:26] let the Holy Spirit take control in the
[1:33:30] circumstances in your life but do the
[1:33:31] things that he shows you to do and you
[1:33:34] will immediately see the victories
[1:33:37] God shows you a certain thing that you
[1:33:40] know like you're you know in your in
[1:33:42] your physical uh health and and he
[1:33:45] reveals something to you and tells you
[1:33:46] to stay away from this food and and you
[1:33:49] know God will show you those things
[1:33:51] and all of a sudden when you just listen
[1:33:54] to that still Small Voice you obey it
[1:33:56] you come under obedience to it you you
[1:33:59] stay consistent with it God looks for
[1:34:02] consistency I look at workers that work
[1:34:05] for me I look for them to show up on
[1:34:07] time I like it when they show up even
[1:34:10] before me
[1:34:11] it shows that there's some consistency
[1:34:13] in them they've got a character in them
[1:34:16] they've got certain self
[1:34:19] you know self-esteem
[1:34:21] that reflects in their lives and in
[1:34:24] their work that shows good character
[1:34:28] that's what he's working on in you and
[1:34:30] me here tonight
