TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] here we are today again in the presence of the lord may the great holy spirit of god bless us as we come together in his name as we study within the seven church ages we continue in these bible studies of the seven church ages and particularly we are speaking about warning promise and reward may god help us as we read his beloved word and pray together for the fire of god to fall upon our hearts let us pray gracious heavenly father we thank you for this privilege once again on another wednesday night to lift up holy hands and hearts before thee thanking you for the word thanking you for this blessed opportunity and this awesome invitation into your divine presence and to a feast at the king's table take all glory honor and praise due to your name thank you for the word which we are about to read in jesus name amen and amen and now friends let us turn in our bibles to revelation chapter 2 reading from verse 20 to be speaking about jezebel behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he that searcheth the reins and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works but unto you i say and unto the rest inside cyra as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden but that which ye have already hold fast till i come and he that overcome it and keep it my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father and i will give him the morning star he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit saith on to the churches amen praise god hallelujah now we know of course uh speaking about this great warning about killing her children with death god is saying you're not going to be sentenced put to death without any uh proof it will be solid rock proof because i the lord search at the hearts and i know the rains or in other words i know your thoughts and that has never changed throughout the very ages no sir there were always two groups within the body of what we call the church god has always looked at this body as having two groups within it the true and the false and of course those who proclaim their revelation is from god and that their relationship is with god however we find both groups but true and false would make that same claim but at the bottom of all of this regardless of man and the proclamations and claims of man god says beyond all of this i know your thoughts i know your reigns i know all your motives and your intentions of course he will know them for he is hebrews 14 12. amen 4 12 and here we find again the bible says nevertheless the foundation of god standeth shore having this seal what seal the seal the lord knoweth them which are his god alone knows his own the eternal knows his eternal ones they have a connection and the great shepherd knows his sheep that means even if the sheep doesn't know themselves or know who they are the great shepherd still knows his sheep he knows his own and will bring them to awareness of who they really are the lord search at the reins of course the word search means to track or to follow up god will track down your thoughts many of you have seen the marvelous and i would say amazing uh videos of god using the seventh church age messenger brother william marion branham standing there upon the platform thousands before him and when he is standing there and the spirit of god begins to reflect through that star messenger then the voice of god will speak out and say oh there in this in the massive crowd there is a man or a woman over there and uh you're thinking so and so this is in your thoughts right now he says and you can't even hide your thoughts from me at this point amen the spirit of the lord was upon him and so the lord as he used that prophet and no thought could be hid from him just think of the lord himself saying i know your thoughts i know you're saying i know your reigns and i can track down or follow your thoughts to the very end point of whatever you were thinking about god knows what's in your heart we can't hide what is in our hearts we may hide it from men we may uh uh some gamblers and people of that nature do train themselves to have a poker face expression yeah you may hide your facial features and your feelings and emotions but god knows the heart god can read whatever is within your souls and he'll know your heart and we humans will know your heart also by your works for your works are the mirror are like a mirror of your thoughts oh you will carry out what you're thinking by the works so your my friends you see you can say one thing but your actions will be speaking something else and will know you from what you are manifesting through your life at that particular time for out of the heart proceeded righteousness or wickedness and deceit see all of our motives all of our purposes are all known to him and as one song says known only to him are the great hidden secrets doesn't matter what and where we try to hide it the all-seeing eye of god knows the heart and knows what is within your thoughts even now while i'm in the midst of the secret of speaking and every deed every act every word spoken or acted or done in darkness jesus said it shall be brought to light that which is done hidden will be shouted out upon the house stops as such amen oh praise god think of what we i just said jesus said and then here comes the prophet of god who says the angel of god spoke to him and said to him your thoughts are heard louder in heaven than your spoken words here upon the earth think on it your thoughts are heard louder in the heavens amen then your spoken words are heard upon the earth you'll find that in the queen of sheba message paragraph 21 and in the patmos vision paragraph 193 yes my friends there's going to be an accounting day paid day is coming someday and there's going to be a day when the books are open and when we have to make an account of the deeds that we have done while our soul was in this body amen and we'll have to answer for those deeds done in the flesh my friends think of it and repent while there is time to repent turn your heart to god while there is yet time to turn your heart to god may the reality of this word strike your soul and bring you to a recognition of what god is doing and has done within your heart and life amen there is no fear of god in the false vine they'll mock they'll scoff even while i'm speaking it may be a matter of of jokes and entertainment in the minds of some amen but one day they shall pay dearly for their thoughts and their acts that they have done and so let all who name the name of christ depart from iniquity and live lives as are becoming true servants children of god to walk in the light of the world amen you see friends we may put on religious trappings religious clothing religious actions religious words and we may deceive millions we may fool millions of people thousands or those around you but we will never be able to fool the eyes in the heart thoughts of god for the lord know it our reigns he knew it our thoughts amen in the midst of his knowing he knows also that there are some that will not let go of his hand but will haul fast to his word and to trust him in the midst of trial revelation 24 25 but unto you i see and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depth of satan as they speak i will put upon you no other burden but that which you already have hold fast till i come amen praise god amen or take god we have peril but we have a promise we have a god that gives us his promise like the mother eagle will tell the young ones to hold on to one quill out of her feathers so that she might take flight with them into the heavenly places and so god grants to us hold to this promise hold to this promise hold to my word hold on hold on how long to hold on hold on not till the end of next trial next tribulation next problem but hold fast till i come amen thank god he's coming again and he is encouraging us to hold fast until he comes again praise god so in this book he is speaking and telling us in that age of scientist that there are two vines two vines twins within the confines of christianity twins within the confines of what we call the message here also amen yes sir two groups one has the doctrine by revelation and the other one does not have it and they're scattered everywhere they're all over the world scattered abroad across the nations and there you'll find each one's doctrine opposing the doctrine of the other one it has been so from canaan abell it has been so right through jacob and esau it has been so through isaac and ishmael it has been so true jesus and judas it has been so right through the apostolic times write down to our day our time that we are seeing this with the same two vines god versus satan god in his children versus satan operating through his own and so the contest is on and the greatest longest battle ever thought is in progress even right now and we are we are in we are engaged in it for we fight not against flesh and blood but we fight against principalities and powers and spiritual wickednesses that are in high places and thank god we are conscious of it we are not just reading it in the bible but we know from experience we know from revelation that we are in actual combat against the devil and his works the warfare continues and the battle is here oh praise his marvelous name certainly my friends we see that these branches have intertwined the branches of this great tree have become intertwined and it's hard to separate them one from the other but yet we know they're everywhere one knowing the depths of god and the other one is filled with the knowledge of the depths of satan amen god said i will put upon you none other burden the word for burden here means weight i will put no other weight upon you and here's another word pressure i will put no more pressure upon you you remember the bible tells us god will not give us any temptation more than we are able to bear oh there god will not give us a a test that he knows we cannot bear and he knows your capability more than yourself he knows your potentials more than you do and he is saying i will not put upon you none other burden see pressure i will not put more pressure on you you see the pressure of the dark ages was already upon them and god is responding to that and he is saying i will not put more pressure upon you except that which you already have this pressure of the dark ages upon you now the the pressure that the dark ages was bringing upon the saints was either to bend them or to cause them to break an actual fact when trials test comes your way in temptations it's either to to make you bow bend or break or buff that's the way that the devil works they come with their action and arrogance and attitude you bow down to our doctrine and our teaching or die this is their proclamation and that was what the inquisition's power play was in that day and in that time of trying to empire build uh build an empire based on satanic worship amen how are you going to do that be organized don't be you just got to be organized and uh are you gonna pay with your life if you are not organized and you don't allow yourself to be a part of some recognized great organization we are going to push you to the side we are going to push you into the the flames of fire we're going to push you into a modern day form of inquisition you will not be able to go certain places you will not be able to do certain things because you need to have their organization their organizational registrations and acceptance before you will be received and so my friends the nudges the hunches the the encouragement to to get yourself organized is all around us it may not be outwardly spoken but it is right there before us or you'll pay the price now we know every age has its own particular pressures and for example the last age that we spoke on they had the pressure of riches riches was upon them the devil was trying to carry them away as he may be trying to carry away some people even in our day with with soft living right soft living but with the soft living comes nervous tension yes sir and we know even in our day we live in a complex age an age that uh it seems like uh people are seem unfitted they're not able to live in this age and to meet the challenges of the age now we know in this fourth church age seemed to have a clear-cut burden and it was that there were to defy rome and to stand up for the word of god even unto death so the commission of this fourth church age was to stand against mr babylon romish a religion and to stand for the word of god for their day and for their age listen to the scriptures they have not known the depths of satan certainly because they have consumed themselves with knowing the depths of god and so they were not going to try to search out the depths of satan whatsoever whosoever he is amen oh praise god if we know what the depths of god are we'll certainly be able to figure out the depths of satan now in ephesians if you have your bible i would like to take up a note ephesians chapter 3 verse 16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be straightened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breath and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of christ which passeth understanding and passeth knowledge that you may be filled with the fullness of god amen well according to these verses when a man experiences the depths of god within his life it is an actual experience of the spirit of god indwelling the individual and their mind becomes illuminated lit up their minds become illuminated hallelujah by the wisdom and knowledge of god through the re re revelation of the word of god oh my forgive me if i stutter like that a little bit that's just the holy spirit upon my heart glory to god when the spirit of god speaks and takes the word of god and grabs ahold of you and you see these things so clearly my friends it strikes your soul like no man can amen yes sir so the depths of satan is that satan will seek to destroy that kind of ingredient an element of wisdom and knowledge that resides within the heart of the true believer that truly believe and sees what god has for them and to destroy them he will try to substitute his own words for god's word remember he did that in the garden when he substituted his words for god's word to eve when he said had god said amen and he quoted god's word back to her with just one word of his own and twisted the entire thing he twisted the entire thing away from her so what is he trying to do destroy the revelation by substituting giving believers a substitute reality to the word instead of the unfailing reality of the revelation of god's word which never changes never lies but remains the truth forever and forever amen amen yes sir oh you tried to take away that knowledge of the truth from you make you be uncertain of it shaky on your faith concerning the word of god but don't stagger don't shake abraham staggered not but hold to the word of god let god sustain you and strengthen you in your inner man that you might walk up rightly in his marvelous and wonderful grace amen hallelujah he'll even try to impersonate the personal life of christ within your spirit making you satisfied with only being a good man or a good woman but that's not what god is asking for god is looking for the actual life of christ to dwell in you by faith by revelation that you get a revelation that it he was living in you not now come in but he was in you from before the foundations of the world but you are now recognizing it that the christian life is not me trying to live like jesus but jesus christ in me trying to live out his own life through this obstructing veil of flesh in which we live may the great holy spirit help you to recognize what is being said here tonight and may you turn your heart towards christ towards the real living christ and let him work his heart within you amen oh my born-again experience that i'm talking about is usually rejected and it is projected to some people it's more intelligent it's more uh culturally acceptable it's it's beautiful in the eyes of people to be a wonderful harmless church member just minding your business living a clean life and just repeating the scriptures and and having the respects and the admiration of all those around you my friends that may be good you may even do good never done wrong in your life but because of original sin back to the word except a man or a woman be born again they shall no wise enter the kingdom of god may the holy spirit help us this day in this hour to see what god has for us within his word the fruit of the depths of satan is upon the people and the fruits that history bears tree of knowledge of good and of evil lies murders of whom he is the father of all lies and was a murderer from the very beginning and horrible crimes committed by of such who hide under the guise of christianity but commit satanic crimes by inspired by the devil with this regalations chapter 5 for your own self-study verses 16 to 26 and you will see the fruits of the depths of satan right within the very word of god god warns us that he gives us a promise and then he gives us great reward revelation 2 verses 26 to 29 remember this is bible study bible teaching out of the word of god living words for a living beings living people elected children of the king to receive this amen something which you must receive and live look and live my brother live sister look and live look to jesus the word and live oh praise god oh praise god hallelujah amen he that overcome it and keep it my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and that he shall rule with a rod of iron as vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father and i will give him the morning star he that had an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches i will give him the morning star glory to god the morning star or the day star which paul saw on the road to damascus and said that it was even brighter than the very sun my friends the day star is a star that doesn't need to come out in the night it comes out during the day the normal star fades away with the rising of the sun but the dead star is even brighter than the sun and when it shines it shines so bright that paul said it was brighter than the sun when the voice came out and said i am jesus amen and it was so bright that that light blinded paul paul was blind just it i i looked at it this way that that light must be brighter than even an arc light from the art welding when it crackles and cracks like that and and the light flashes and the welders have to wear a helmet to be able to do their work with the brightness of that light paul said this dear star the light was so bright that it blinded him it was brighter than the very sun amen yes sir oh praise god god is saying i will give you the morning star in other words i'll give you a revelation of myself that will be so clear so bright that it will light up your life it will light up the word when you read it when you listen to it when you hear it it will light up your entire being for he has given to you what the brightness of the morning star has struck your soul amen glory to god he that overcome it and keep it my works to the end not for a while but to keep my works on to the end oh let's keep pressing brother sister let's press amen till the night turns into morning let's keep pressing hallelujah until jesus comes again oh praises marvelous name the lord god is trying to get his own to see his own opinion of what he looks at as righteousness amen and as victory and as honest of faithfulness praise god hallelujah i thank god that he is saying the faithful overcomer will be a powerful person amen maybe not with earthly power but there will be having the power of god to rule over the spirit realm and exercising divine authority and enforcement oh my friends while i'm speaking rome is growing in power while we are yet speaking mystery babylon is rising into power working and moving inspired by satan and exercising ordly power and control but thank god to conquer that for god raises up a standard against the enemy amen god has given his children amen uh supernatural spiritual power to come against the works of satan and the acts of satan amen while they exercise power with state backing the backing of governments and they have in their employ a kings working on their behalf armies and legislators working for them and passing laws that will benefit them amen she stands with great power naturally and she is able to break and grind you before her trying to break and bend the sons and does of god but we shall not bow we shall not break we shall not bend we are not going down we are going up with the first rapture and resurrection may the holy spirit of the living god confirm these words here today within your heart within my life to his glory and to his honor amen yes sir she has killed millions and millions in the past and she hungers even now to kill millions more and that will not bow to her she sets up kings and she'll she knows she got the power to bring them down also amen hallelujah her interference into the politics of this world and the power structures of this world my friends has caused many nations many leaders to fall many nations to go into disarray amen yes sir oh praise god and all that is happening because she wants to destroy god's little elect remember how the pharaoh killed all the force born trying to get amen at this one child moses that was to be born think of it herod that serpent moving upon him caused him to kill all the force born again trying to get to what christ the messiah who had to flee into egypt for safety and again in this hour that spirit of satan moving again or if it has to destroy nations if it has to destroy powers it's really trying to get at that little flock that elected seed of god within that nation that country wherever they are trying to break break their will break their faith amen but that doesn't do it my friends fire only refines the gold even shiner brighter and better than it was before and causes it to be able to come receive and to shape itself into the perfect image of jesus christ the mold of god amen and amen hallelujah amen or works the works of mystery babylon romish mr babylon as the works of the devil amen yes sir she murders and she lies about it and tells other lies just like it was from the beginning so is it and it will continue to be right to the end until she's cast into the lake of fire oh but there's coming a day there's coming a day when god is going to say the day of the lord bring my enemies before them that i may judge them and have them slain amen and cast into the lake of fire hallelujah o praise god then my friends all the blasphemers the mockers the scoffers will find their place with satan in the lake of fire him and all of his servants all of his children all of them will be cast into that lake of fire amen praise god and all those who destroy and pollute the earth god will destroy them for their polluting of the earth and polluting of the spirit realm of the earth and polluting the atmospheres of the earth yes sir judgment the judgment of god is at hand oh it seems as if the word of god and the prophecy as if it's delayed and it's a story it will never happen my friends but it will happen it seems like it's delay but it shall come to pass as the word of god has said amen yes sir thank god listen and i will give him the morning star in the midst of the darkness in the midst of the tests and the trials amen i will give him the morning star write in your notebooks or place it within your heart revelation 22 16. ii peter chapter 1 verse 19 where jesus says i am the bright and morning star i am the root and offspring of david the bright and morning star until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts hallelujah the spirit of god is therefore making a promise of reward to the elect of this age hallelujah amen and in all the ages to come hallelujah amen that luck he will give you the morning star now he has identified himself with the messengers and the messengers are are described in the word of god which he himself revelation chapter 1 amen they are the seven stars within his hands but you know the star is a reflector for the star reflects the light of the sun after that the sun has gone down amen but thank god that these stars will not shine as bright as the mighty angel the great one with the swept back wings these seven stars will not be able to shine as bright as the day star the bright and morning star hallelujah the bright and day star the bright and morning star so bright my friends that will blind some but give light and revelation to others how thankful we are to god in this day that he has given himself to us hallelujah that in the midst of the darkness of leodisia we have been given the marvelous glorious shining light of the bright and morning star better known as the dead star from on high the chief star jesus himself hallelujah jesus who dwelleth in light of which no man can approach amen and in that future kingdom of the new jerusalem he himself hallelujah will light up the city just with his personal presence he will not be using messengers for that but he himself will be the light that lights up that great city it will be jesus himself speaking to us face to face there in his kingdom when we shall see him as the old songwriter says face the face will i behold him far beyond the starry sky face to face in all his glory i shall see him in the by and by oh we shall be able to talk it over with our lord we'll be able to speak with him my friends and open up our hearts to him it's the bright and the morning star that is visible when the light of the sun commences the shine hallelujah and when our s-u-n jesus amen comes there that will be something to cheer us and to move our hopes and our hearts up with joy hallelujah and he will bring us the message of what his own presence hallelujah the message of his presence and bring to us the clarity of the light of his word amen and that word which was given from the time of the prophet of malachi 4 5 is getting brighter and brighter and brighter until the brightness will take us all into the perfect day hallelujah for that is the path of a righteous man that grows brighter and brighter until we walk into that perfect day thank god that we desire jesus above everything else all we want is jesus all we love is jesus everything we desire is jesus for jesus himself is perfect everything he himself said the servant of god is perfect everything and we end with these words as the scripture says he that had an ear to hear what the spirit said to the churches let him hear even so lord god by thy spirit let us hear thy truth tonight may god bless us everyone and may the word of god be rooted grounded in your spirit that you may grow up into him into trees of life and righteousness for his glory and honor wouldn't you write to me once you text won't you converse with us commit your life to christ not just with a happy god lucky at the altar friends that's wonderful but truly know from spiritual experience that you have heard from heaven and something has taken place within your soul come out of her my people come out of mystery babylon come out of rome come out of your sins come out of your past amen oh let the dead pass barriers dead come to life in christ and receive him now god bless you [Music] you
