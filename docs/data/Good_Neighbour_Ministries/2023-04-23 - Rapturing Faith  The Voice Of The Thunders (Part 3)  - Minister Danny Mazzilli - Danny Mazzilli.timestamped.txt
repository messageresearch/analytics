[41:49] good morning Pastor Simon
[41:52] it's good to see you in the house the
[41:53] Lord amen uh let's uh
[41:57] pray before we go to the word this
[41:58] morning
[42:00] amen father we are truly grateful this
[42:03] morning Lord to be assembled
[42:06] in your presence once again Lord
[42:09] it's it's what changes everything
[42:12] it's what changed our lives it's what a
[42:16] truly has brought us to the uh reality
[42:19] of your presence and and that you are
[42:22] God and that you alone stand father and
[42:25] that there is none beside thee none
[42:28] before thee none after thee you are the
[42:31] living one and true God and so we ask
[42:34] your presence this morning to come and
[42:36] anoint the word and just Inspire our
[42:39] hearts as we speak Lord and Inspire Our
[42:42] Lives as we hear the word of God this
[42:44] morning may it translate us change us
[42:47] and give us what we have need of in this
[42:49] hour in Jesus Christ's name amen
[42:53] praise God
[42:55] let's go to the first slide this morning
[42:57] we're going to continue along the lines
[42:59] of the thought of rapturing faith
[43:03] we'll be looking at part three today
[43:06] and our thought this morning is the
[43:09] voice of the Thunders and we're going to
[43:11] be looking
[43:13] um at the word and uh you know we need
[43:16] to realize that this message that God
[43:18] has given us
[43:20] um that has called us out is a unique
[43:24] message
[43:25] it's not something that uh you know that
[43:28] is being preached in all the churches
[43:30] out there
[43:32] um we are a church that have been called
[43:35] by the Living God when somebody asks oh
[43:39] you know what is your church I tell them
[43:41] we are a continuation of the book of
[43:44] Acts
[43:45] it's not the acts of the people but it's
[43:48] the acts of the Holy Ghost in the people
[43:51] and that is our experience that the Lord
[43:53] is continuing his program his plan that
[43:58] which he ordained for this world at this
[44:01] time
[44:03] and so we have recognized that God has
[44:06] done marvelous things that he's the same
[44:09] yesterday today and forever that he sent
[44:12] us a prophet in the 20th century and
[44:15] that we have recognized that God does
[44:18] nothing unless he first reveals it unto
[44:20] his servants the prophets that's what
[44:22] makes him the same yesterday today and
[44:24] forever a lot of people when you tell
[44:26] them you know that that God is the same
[44:29] yesterday today and forever and when he
[44:31] does something he doesn't change
[44:33] the way you can trust him is to know
[44:36] that he does things the same because he
[44:39] is the same
[44:40] amen amen praise God and so uh that
[44:43] reality is what transforms us as
[44:47] children of God to recognize that that
[44:50] we have a part in the word of God that
[44:52] God is doing something today
[44:54] and we're a part of that
[44:57] and that's what gives us Supernatural
[44:59] Faith to overcome the age that we're
[45:02] living in
[45:03] praise God
[45:05] so we're going to read this morning
[45:06] let's go to our first scripture
[45:09] a very familiar scripture
[45:12] Revelations 10
[45:14] verses one to seven
[45:17] and the scripture says and I saw another
[45:19] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[45:21] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[45:24] upon his head and his face was as it
[45:27] were the son and his feet as pillars of
[45:31] Fire
[45:31] and he had in his hand a little book
[45:34] open
[45:36] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[45:38] and his left foot upon the Earth and
[45:41] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[45:44] roarth and when he had cried seven
[45:48] Thunders uttered their voices
[45:51] and when the seven Thunders had uttered
[45:54] their voices I was about to write and I
[45:57] Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me
[46:00] seal up those things which the seven
[46:03] Thunders uttered and right them not
[46:07] and the angel which I saw stand upon the
[46:10] sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[46:13] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[46:16] liveth forever and ever who created
[46:18] heaven and the things that are therein
[46:25] that that they're in our and the earth
[46:28] and the things that they're in our and
[46:32] the Sea and the things which are therein
[46:35] that there should be time no more but in
[46:39] the days of the voice of the seventh
[46:42] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[46:46] mystery of God should be finished as he
[46:49] hath declared to his servants the
[46:52] prophets
[46:54] our next scripture
[46:57] go to the next slide is from Deuteronomy
[46:59] 29 verse 29 it says the secret things
[47:03] belong unto the Lord our God
[47:07] but those things which are revealed
[47:10] belong
[47:12] unto us and to our children forever that
[47:16] we may do all the words of this law God
[47:21] bless you you may be seated
[47:24] amen praise God
[47:27] uh last week we were we were looking at
[47:31] um you know the maturity of the bride
[47:33] and we were looking at how the bride is
[47:35] coming into a level of maturity to
[47:37] recognize her placing in the word her
[47:40] position in the word and you know I want
[47:43] to read from a scripture here in Saint
[47:46] John chapter 12 verses 23 to 32 Jesus
[47:50] answered them saying the hour has come
[47:53] that the son of man should be glorified
[47:56] now you got to recognize the time and
[47:58] the season that Jesus was in he was in
[48:01] the stage where he was going to go into
[48:04] where he was gonna actually give himself
[48:08] at the cross he was going to back to his
[48:12] position as the father and here he's
[48:15] talking about verily verily I say unto
[48:17] you except a corn of wheat fall into the
[48:20] ground and die in abideth alone but if
[48:24] it die it bringeth forth much fruit well
[48:27] we are that fruit vote because of the
[48:30] result of him going down and the seed
[48:33] that will come forth in the end will be
[48:36] the same seed that started in the
[48:38] beginning the same word that was there
[48:41] in Genesis Elohim was God the
[48:45] self-existent one is the same one that's
[48:47] going to finish up the whole program of
[48:50] God and everything that he had ordained
[48:53] that he had seen in the in his mind all
[48:56] that he had uh focused that he had that
[48:59] all that was done before the foundations
[49:01] of the world we're going to see it being
[49:03] fulfilled in our part in the word of God
[49:06] and how he's going to do it in and
[49:09] through US amen and so he says here he
[49:13] that loveth his life shall lose it and
[49:16] he that hateth his life in this world
[49:18] shall keep it unto life eternal
[49:22] If any man serve me let him follow me
[49:25] and where I am there shall also my
[49:28] servant be if any man serve me him will
[49:31] my father honor now is my soul troubled
[49:35] and what shall I say father save me from
[49:38] this hour but for this cause came I into
[49:41] the world he knew his place he knew why
[49:45] he had come he knew why he had to go to
[49:49] Calvary he understood it there was
[49:51] nothing that would keep him from it amen
[49:54] but listen father glorify thy name
[49:59] then notice came there a voice from
[50:03] heaven saying I have both glorified it
[50:06] and will glorify it again
[50:11] he was looking down through time he was
[50:14] seen this day he was seeing the hour
[50:16] that that he was that that that
[50:18] everything would culminate to he knew
[50:21] that he had a purpose he knew that he
[50:23] wanted to redeem his sons and daughters
[50:25] he saw you he saw me he saw each and
[50:29] every one of us amen but notice here the
[50:33] people therefore that stood by and heard
[50:35] it said that it thundered
[50:37] others said an angel spoke to him Jesus
[50:41] answered and said the voice came not
[50:45] because of me but for your sakes
[50:49] now is the Judgment of this world
[50:53] now shall the prince of this world be
[50:56] cast out
[50:57] and I if I be lifted up from the earth
[51:02] will draw all men unto me
[51:06] praise God and so what I want you to
[51:09] note there is that when the Lord spoke
[51:13] it thundered
[51:15] it thundered and it wasn't for for Jesus
[51:18] sake but it was for our sake
[51:20] when the Thunders came forth that we've
[51:24] heard here from the scripture that we
[51:26] read there's a message within those
[51:28] Thunders
[51:29] there's the unwritten aspect of the word
[51:32] that is doing something in each and
[51:35] every one of our lives right now
[51:36] preparing us for one thing
[51:39] the rapture the body change the
[51:43] translation amen John was told don't
[51:47] write it he heard the Thunders uttered
[51:49] their voices and was about to write but
[51:52] what what could be the reason that he
[51:54] was told not to write it there's a
[51:56] reason to everything
[51:59] that's what we're going to be looking
[52:01] into
[52:01] we're looking into this thought and this
[52:05] understanding of the of the Thunders and
[52:08] the voice and we know that brother
[52:09] Branham said that when the Thunder went
[52:12] forth it was the voice of God
[52:15] it was the voice of the Resurrection
[52:17] there's a voice there's a supernatural
[52:20] voice right now that's thundering from
[52:23] this this Pulpit from every anointed
[52:27] Pulpit every Son of God under the
[52:30] five-fold ministry that recognizes their
[52:32] position in the word of God knows that
[52:35] God is thundering forth a message that
[52:38] is going to translate us that's going to
[52:41] give us the kind of faith that we need
[52:43] in order for these vile bodies to be
[52:45] changed in order for us to overcome the
[52:48] circumstances that we are dealing with
[52:50] right now in each and every one of our
[52:52] Lives because we got to deal with these
[52:54] circumstances
[52:56] we're human beings we're looking for a
[52:58] way to get out to to get by to to make
[53:02] enough money you know to to fulfill the
[53:05] goals and the desires that are in our
[53:06] hearts but God has such a greater
[53:09] calling Upon Our Lives
[53:11] he's got such a greater uh purpose for
[53:14] each and every one of us and he knows
[53:16] that you're going to need a special kind
[53:18] of faith
[53:19] to in order to overcome this Dimension
[53:22] amen glory to God Amen but he didn't
[53:25] write those things for a purpose
[53:27] those things are supernaturally revealed
[53:30] you cannot you cannot learn these things
[53:34] you cannot theologically teach yourself
[53:38] or go to a School of Theology to to
[53:41] learn and to receive the Revelation that
[53:44] God is placing in this day and in this
[53:46] hour the kind of Faith the rapturing
[53:48] faith that we need in order to fulfill
[53:51] the body change amen praise God
[53:54] hallelujah hallelujah so listen to
[53:57] brother Branham he speak he speaks here
[53:59] in the first seal he says the voice is a
[54:02] thunder
[54:06] The Voice came from where from the
[54:09] throne where the lamb had just left as
[54:12] intercessor
[54:14] so we realize now that when the time of
[54:17] the opening of the seals
[54:19] came
[54:21] there had to be an angel on the earth a
[54:23] messenger on the earth that would be the
[54:27] anointed word in order to bring about
[54:30] the opening of those seals remember the
[54:34] seals only covered
[54:36] they were they were sealing the book but
[54:40] inside the book there was Supernatural
[54:42] Faith
[54:44] Supernatural rapturing faith that would
[54:47] be released to the children of God at an
[54:51] appointed time and season
[54:53] it was not going to be any time before
[54:56] God's appointed time according to his
[54:59] word the other thing you need to note is
[55:02] that there's nothing that that was
[55:04] written under those seals that was not
[55:08] already written in the book
[55:11] so we're not looking for some you know
[55:14] uh new man to come on the scene we're
[55:16] not we're not there's nobody uh you know
[55:19] and certainly not me you know coming
[55:21] here to say that I've got something I've
[55:23] got a supernatural Revelation that I'm
[55:25] going to give you here today that is
[55:27] going to give you rapturing Faith No Sir
[55:30] everything that you have need of is
[55:33] already in you
[55:36] everything that you have need of God
[55:39] gave it to you from when before the
[55:42] foundations of the world anybody that's
[55:44] going in the Rapture their names were
[55:46] written in the Lamb's Book of Life when
[55:49] before the foundations of the world so
[55:52] we're not bringing anything here and
[55:54] we're going to say oh brother you are
[55:55] going to go in the Rapture and sister
[55:57] you're not going to go in the Rapture
[55:59] that has nothing to do with it
[56:01] the word attribute that's in you right
[56:05] now has already got a destination
[56:08] printed right into the genealogy of it
[56:13] there's nothing that can change your
[56:15] destination
[56:17] if you are ordained for the Rapture you
[56:20] can't miss it if you wanted to
[56:22] Hallelujah
[56:24] but what you need to come into is the
[56:26] season and the recognition of the word
[56:29] that's being fulfilled right now so that
[56:32] like brother Branham listen when brother
[56:33] Branham came to the opening of those
[56:35] seals he said this is the greatest time
[56:39] of my life
[56:41] he says of all the things that God has
[56:44] done for for us through the meetings and
[56:47] the the healings and the people that
[56:49] were raised from the dead the blinded
[56:51] eyes that were open he says it was
[56:53] marvelous but this
[56:55] there's never been a time like this
[56:58] why because he came to realize that he
[57:01] was that angel he was that seventh
[57:05] eighth Earthly angel now
[57:06] it wasn't brother Branham that opened
[57:09] the seals
[57:10] remember it was the mighty angel that
[57:12] came down put his foot on the land in
[57:14] the sea and said time shall be no more
[57:17] it was Christ coming down
[57:19] it was Christ himself that came down
[57:22] that that was going to open the word and
[57:26] release the names that were written in
[57:28] the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah
[57:31] praise God so here he says now
[57:34] he is standing here to take his position
[57:36] he's left the throne as intercessor now
[57:39] at some point
[57:41] well first of all
[57:43] there's not going to be anybody added or
[57:46] taken away from the Lamb's Book of Life
[57:49] can we can we make that clear
[57:52] okay so so so
[57:55] intercessor Jesus when when the mighty
[57:58] angel came down
[58:00] he's come down now to claim his
[58:03] possessions
[58:04] he's he's already made intercession
[58:07] intercession was done from before the
[58:10] when the bleeding bloody lamb stepped
[58:12] out from the throne and had a book John
[58:16] was was crying because he he wanted to
[58:19] know if his name was in the book he
[58:21] needed to know that somebody could open
[58:22] that book that somebody could release
[58:25] and and he wanted to see if his name was
[58:27] in that book because he knew that
[58:29] something Supernatural was taking place
[58:31] he heard those Thunders he saw what was
[58:35] being written he saw he saw it but he
[58:37] was told don't write it
[58:39] you see everything was there a so so
[58:42] there's nothing new here that we're
[58:44] trying to bring but we're trying to
[58:46] bring each and every one of us into the
[58:48] place where we can understand where
[58:50] we're at
[58:51] brother Branham knew where he was at
[58:53] listen listen here he says now he is
[58:56] standing here to take his position and
[58:59] his claims
[59:00] but the thunder came from the inside of
[59:04] the throne
[59:05] thundered out and the lamb was standing
[59:08] out here the Thunder where the lamb had
[59:12] left
[59:13] the father's Throne to go to take his
[59:17] own throne
[59:19] Glory now don't miss it friends he says
[59:23] we all know as Christians that God swore
[59:26] to David that he would raise up Christ
[59:29] to sit on his throne and give him an
[59:32] everlasting kingdom here on Earth
[59:36] see brother Branham was seeing the
[59:38] Fulfillment of all the Prophecies of the
[59:41] Old Testament
[59:42] he was recognizing that something now
[59:45] was taking place of tremendous
[59:48] significance
[59:50] he did it and Jesus said he that
[59:53] overcomes the Antichrist and all the
[59:57] things of the world shall sit with me on
[1:00:00] my throne
[1:00:02] what have we seen in the church ages
[1:00:05] what did he say in the seventh Church
[1:00:07] age he said he that can overcome
[1:00:13] shall sit with me on my throne
[1:00:16] he's talking about a people that are
[1:00:18] going to sit with him that are going to
[1:00:20] rule with him for a thousand years
[1:00:23] remember this doesn't all end
[1:00:27] in the rapture
[1:00:29] and the whole thing's finished no that's
[1:00:31] just going to be another stage
[1:00:34] of the culmination of the Fulfillment of
[1:00:37] his complete plan
[1:00:39] amen there's still going to be another
[1:00:41] thousand years left here on this Earth
[1:00:44] after
[1:00:46] the Rapture of the three and a half
[1:00:49] years and the tribulation of the three
[1:00:51] and a half years
[1:00:52] we go for three and a half years but we
[1:00:54] come back
[1:00:55] got to see the big picture here God's
[1:00:58] preparing a people to rule to sit with
[1:01:01] him on his throne amen praise God and so
[1:01:04] listen so he did it and Jesus said he
[1:01:07] that overcomes the Antichrist and all
[1:01:09] the things of the world shall sit with
[1:01:10] me on my Throne as I have overcome and
[1:01:13] have sit down on my father's Throne now
[1:01:16] someday he rises from the father's
[1:01:19] throne and goes to take his own Throne
[1:01:22] amen now he comes forth to call his
[1:01:25] subjects how is he going to claim them
[1:01:28] he's already got the book of redemption
[1:01:31] in his hand
[1:01:33] so he's the only one that can claim his
[1:01:36] own amen he's already got the book of
[1:01:39] reject Glory he says oh I feel like
[1:01:41] singing to him
[1:01:42] soon the lamb will take his bride to be
[1:01:46] ever at his side all of hosts of heaven
[1:01:49] will assemble be
[1:01:53] Oh Glory to God soon he's taken his
[1:01:56] bride
[1:01:57] oh it will be a glorious sight all the
[1:02:01] saints in spotless white and with Jesus
[1:02:04] we shall Feast
[1:02:07] eternally
[1:02:10] you know you're often wonder and you
[1:02:12] think man
[1:02:14] what are we going to do
[1:02:16] for eternity
[1:02:19] has no beginning and no end
[1:02:21] well you're getting a little glimpse of
[1:02:23] it right now
[1:02:24] you're feasting on Revelation
[1:02:27] you're feasting on the glory of God the
[1:02:30] presence of God
[1:02:32] that all things can can be possible in
[1:02:35] your life right now
[1:02:37] everything that you desire as a son or a
[1:02:41] daughter of God you've got to recognize
[1:02:43] your position and that all that
[1:02:46] everything that you have need of is
[1:02:48] already provided
[1:02:51] Within
[1:02:52] you as an attribute of God Amen praise
[1:02:55] God oh my talk about sitting now in
[1:02:57] Heavenly places
[1:02:59] what will it be if we can feel this way
[1:03:02] sitting down here on Earth before the
[1:03:04] Rapture comes
[1:03:06] in this condition that we're in now and
[1:03:09] we can enjoy and stand up around walls
[1:03:11] and Stand in the Rain just to hear this
[1:03:13] what will it be when we see him sitting
[1:03:16] there oh my oh it'll be a glorious time
[1:03:19] amen praise God forevermore let's go to
[1:03:23] the next slide
[1:03:25] so Revelation uh brother Brown 1961 he
[1:03:30] says here now the voice of the throne
[1:03:33] notice in this Throne Before the Throne
[1:03:36] was the Seven Stars the voice of the
[1:03:40] Stars the voices you see there are more
[1:03:44] in the Revelation four or five here we
[1:03:47] find out and out of the throne preceding
[1:03:50] Lightnings Thunders and voices not one
[1:03:54] voice
[1:03:55] voices plural what was it God's speaking
[1:04:00] to the church reflecting himself through
[1:04:02] the seven spirits amen God can reflect
[1:04:07] he it's all God
[1:04:10] we need to come to realize that this
[1:04:13] program that God has designed it to
[1:04:16] fulfill his word is Christ in you
[1:04:20] your hope of glory
[1:04:22] it is the same spirit that raised Christ
[1:04:25] from the dead dwelling in you that is
[1:04:28] going to Quicken you
[1:04:29] and take you from this Mortal to
[1:04:32] immortality and so God speaking to the
[1:04:36] church reflecting himself through the
[1:04:39] seven spirits when the true anointed of
[1:04:42] God speaks it's the voice of God
[1:04:45] to reject it is to remove the
[1:04:48] Candlestick see voices the voices of the
[1:04:51] seven churches over here in the corner
[1:04:53] the voice is speaking with thunder and
[1:04:56] lightning and so we need to recognize
[1:04:59] the importance of recognizing William
[1:05:02] Miriam Branham as the seventh Church age
[1:05:07] messenger that God sent
[1:05:10] in order to fulfill Malachi 4 5 and
[1:05:14] Revelations 10 7. go to the next slide
[1:05:18] there was two Ministries
[1:05:21] of William Miriam Branham one was
[1:05:26] the messenger of Malachi 4 5 and
[1:05:29] Revelations 10 7 is going to do two
[1:05:32] things one according to Malachi 4 he
[1:05:35] will turn the hearts of the children to
[1:05:37] the fathers
[1:05:38] now by the by the revealing of the word
[1:05:42] by the opening of those Seven Seals
[1:05:44] there was released a supernatural
[1:05:48] understanding of the word of God things
[1:05:52] that brother Branham himself said that
[1:05:55] had not the angel there were seven
[1:05:57] angels that came to meet him every night
[1:06:00] while he was opening those seals and he
[1:06:02] says if the angel had not come to reveal
[1:06:05] to him what was actually written under
[1:06:08] that seal he'd have made a mistake
[1:06:11] and he wouldn't have brought forth that
[1:06:13] that white horse rider was actually
[1:06:14] Satan going out to conquer you see that
[1:06:18] was one of the Mysteries that was
[1:06:20] written under the word but it was always
[1:06:22] in the word
[1:06:23] it was just that it wasn't revealed
[1:06:26] everything that we have need of is all
[1:06:29] in the word it just wasn't revealed yet
[1:06:33] and so when those seals were open
[1:06:37] uh so so so when those seals were open
[1:06:40] brother Branham actually fulfilled
[1:06:43] Malachi 4 5. by turning the hearts of
[1:06:46] the children it was a supernatural Faith
[1:06:49] now that was being revealed through his
[1:06:51] ministry the godhead all those things
[1:06:54] were being revealed through his ministry
[1:06:57] right from when he started out
[1:07:00] and it was a supernatural Revelation
[1:07:03] that was being released to the Sons and
[1:07:06] Daughters of God and because you were an
[1:07:09] attribute of God
[1:07:11] ordained to this message ordained to
[1:07:14] this calling this dispensation
[1:07:17] you recognize the word you don't know
[1:07:21] how you recognized it
[1:07:22] you didn't understand how you recognized
[1:07:25] it but something in you thundered within
[1:07:28] your heart
[1:07:29] something spoke to you and said that's
[1:07:33] the truth that makes sense so the
[1:07:37] opening of the word
[1:07:39] released a faith to turn you back to the
[1:07:42] word of God
[1:07:44] to the pure word of God
[1:07:47] a lot of us were in denominations in
[1:07:49] Catholic churches and Baptist Churches
[1:07:51] Pentecostal churches we have been going
[1:07:54] to church it's not a matter of going to
[1:07:56] church it wasn't a matter of reading
[1:07:58] from the Holy Bible anybody can read
[1:08:01] from from the Bible and many people are
[1:08:02] reading from the Bible
[1:08:04] but there's there's something in the
[1:08:06] Bible says the spirit gives it life
[1:08:09] if the Holy Spirit was ordained in you
[1:08:14] which is that attribute that is the Holy
[1:08:16] Spirit by the way
[1:08:18] the attribute of God in you is a portion
[1:08:21] of God himself the Holy Ghost
[1:08:24] he interprets his own word
[1:08:27] that's why as an attribute of God you
[1:08:30] can't sin
[1:08:31] you can't disbelieve how can God
[1:08:33] disbelieve himself
[1:08:35] if you're a portion of God how's God
[1:08:37] going to disbelieve himself this
[1:08:40] your struggles your battles as a human
[1:08:43] being every day it struggles it it's
[1:08:47] that enmity against God your Colonel
[1:08:49] mind at times tries to figure things out
[1:08:52] but the moment you try it to allow your
[1:08:54] carnal mind to figure things out you're
[1:08:56] going to blow up
[1:08:57] especially when it comes to this
[1:09:00] this is something you just got to relax
[1:09:03] you just got to let the Holy Spirit do
[1:09:05] what he started in your life
[1:09:07] this is not something you started
[1:09:09] you didn't start this you didn't deserve
[1:09:12] this you didn't do anything to deserve
[1:09:14] this I never did anything to deserve
[1:09:16] this most of us deserved a lot worse I
[1:09:19] mean
[1:09:20] bad not a lot worse this is the glory of
[1:09:24] God we deserved to be to be completely
[1:09:27] cast out
[1:09:29] but God's grace came into our lives
[1:09:32] because of because of an attribute that
[1:09:34] he had placed there because he he saw
[1:09:37] you from before the foundations of the
[1:09:39] world and he placed your name on the
[1:09:41] Lamb's Book of Life knowing that when
[1:09:43] the word would come to you you would
[1:09:46] accept it
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:48] you can't reject this word amen praise
[1:09:51] God and so he he will reveal the
[1:09:54] Mysteries the second thing so one he
[1:09:57] turns the heart back to the children and
[1:10:00] and two he will reveal the mysteries of
[1:10:02] the seven thunders in Revelation 10
[1:10:05] which are the revelations contained in
[1:10:08] the Seven Seals it will be these
[1:10:11] divinely re uh revealed mystery truths
[1:10:16] that literally turn the hearts of the
[1:10:18] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:10:21] exactly so
[1:10:23] so when those seals were open
[1:10:27] and they're still opening
[1:10:30] they're still unveiling they're still
[1:10:32] unfolding as you as you want you know if
[1:10:35] you want to describe it because we're
[1:10:37] still here
[1:10:39] the the culmination is going to be the
[1:10:42] Rapture of the church because the mighty
[1:10:45] Angel comes to claim his possessions
[1:10:47] amen for the Rapture of the church then
[1:10:51] goes to the Jews and the tribulation and
[1:10:54] everything else but right now what are
[1:10:56] we concerned about
[1:10:58] the rapture
[1:10:59] what are we concerned about
[1:11:01] we're not to get concerned about
[1:11:03] anything else but to get into our
[1:11:06] position as Sons and Daughters of God in
[1:11:09] order to receive rapturing faith
[1:11:12] for a body change and so brother Branham
[1:11:16] realized
[1:11:17] he realized at that moment
[1:11:20] when he was entering into that
[1:11:23] season of Revelations 10 1-7 he saw the
[1:11:30] significance he saw that the mighty
[1:11:34] Angel himself
[1:11:36] was in that cluster of seven angels
[1:11:39] when when the cloud came down and and
[1:11:41] and and it come to him on Sunset
[1:11:44] mountain and those seven angels stood
[1:11:46] before him there was a great Thunder at
[1:11:50] that moment God was revealing to brother
[1:11:52] Branham right there and then
[1:11:55] goal West he says we're going to be
[1:11:58] opening up those Seven Seals it was the
[1:12:01] time of his policing it was the time of
[1:12:05] his crowning of his of his his uh
[1:12:08] portion in the word of God where he was
[1:12:10] going to go now and and be that seventh
[1:12:13] angel that seventh Earthly angel that
[1:12:16] would be the one that God was going to
[1:12:18] speak through remember he's the voice of
[1:12:22] God
[1:12:23] he was projecting the voice of God Amen
[1:12:27] and that's what he was he realized now
[1:12:30] he he was coming into his position
[1:12:32] this was his time
[1:12:34] this was the greatest time of his life
[1:12:37] it was going to be the the the the
[1:12:39] culmination of everything for him
[1:12:42] and you'll notice that when that time
[1:12:44] came into his life everything started to
[1:12:47] change around him
[1:12:50] Hallelujah go to the next
[1:12:53] slide
[1:12:54] so who's revealing the Thunders
[1:12:58] and the question here he's uh he he's
[1:13:00] he's given a question have the seven
[1:13:01] Thunders which equals seven Mysteries
[1:13:05] already been revealed
[1:13:07] were they revealed in the Seven Seals
[1:13:10] but
[1:13:11] are yet
[1:13:13] but are yet not known to us as the
[1:13:16] Thunders yet
[1:13:18] see there was the people were were in a
[1:13:20] state of confusion they didn't
[1:13:22] understand what was actually going on
[1:13:25] have the Thunders been revealed listen
[1:13:27] he says no they were revealed in the
[1:13:31] Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was
[1:13:35] about
[1:13:36] the Thunders when when the mighty Angel
[1:13:39] uh when when John heard the seven
[1:13:42] Thunders and the Seven voices the the
[1:13:45] voices that thundered out he actually
[1:13:48] saw everything that was written in he
[1:13:52] actually saw everything he saw the the
[1:13:55] white horse rider who it was he saw
[1:13:57] everything because everything was in the
[1:13:59] word but God said well hold on a minute
[1:14:02] you're not writing that part
[1:14:04] because we're not there yet
[1:14:06] we're not there yet we haven't come to
[1:14:09] that season yet
[1:14:10] there's things that are taking place
[1:14:12] right now that's leading us to that
[1:14:15] place and we need to realize that
[1:14:17] there's a season for everything
[1:14:20] that's why a lot of people they're
[1:14:21] getting confused that you know there's
[1:14:23] there's controversy around the Thunders
[1:14:27] the Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders
[1:14:29] and were they open and were they not
[1:14:31] open and and all kinds of of controversy
[1:14:34] and individuals that are stepping out
[1:14:37] and claiming that they know what it is
[1:14:39] that they expect brother Branham to come
[1:14:42] back or that they expect another
[1:14:44] Messenger to come and bring the the the
[1:14:47] the the teachings on what was in the
[1:14:50] Thunders
[1:14:52] God is the only interpreter of his word
[1:14:55] amen
[1:14:57] the Thunders can only be interpreted by
[1:14:59] The Thunderman himself Jesus Christ the
[1:15:02] same yesterday today and forever
[1:15:05] Hallelujah and everything that was under
[1:15:07] those first six seals it's been revealed
[1:15:11] it's all going to play out still but
[1:15:14] it's already been revealed what's going
[1:15:16] to take place we know now who the white
[1:15:18] horse rider is the red horse rider the
[1:15:21] black horse rider the pale rider that's
[1:15:23] still writing today
[1:15:25] he's ridden right into this message as a
[1:15:27] matter of fact trying to do the same
[1:15:30] things that he's always done deceive the
[1:15:32] people get them to to look to somebody
[1:15:35] get them to look to a to a a big
[1:15:38] preacher or or a famous preacher or
[1:15:42] somebody that that that's been around
[1:15:43] longer and knows things no no no no no
[1:15:47] All Eyes On Jesus
[1:15:50] all eyes on the word amen don't look
[1:15:54] anywhere else don't you look to anyone
[1:15:56] else don't you look for any
[1:15:57] interpretation on the word of God God is
[1:16:00] going to interpret it in your own life
[1:16:02] just look at your life
[1:16:04] look at your own life
[1:16:06] who got you to where you are today
[1:16:10] Hallelujah brother
[1:16:12] it ain't no man that's going to get you
[1:16:14] to where you are today sure you obeyed
[1:16:18] God you came under a Ministry you came
[1:16:21] subject to your pastor because he's the
[1:16:24] candle that God placed in the church
[1:16:27] and when you do that God honors his word
[1:16:30] and feeds you because you're under
[1:16:33] obedience to his word he's only honoring
[1:16:37] his word when you get when you become
[1:16:40] somebody that you can't come under
[1:16:41] subjection to a pastor
[1:16:44] you got trouble paying tithes
[1:16:47] it goes to show there's something
[1:16:50] there that needs to come up hither
[1:16:54] Hallelujah an attribute of God cannot
[1:16:57] rebel against the word of God Amen
[1:17:01] the word of God is Supernatural
[1:17:04] if you believe God and you know that God
[1:17:07] knows you knows all about you knows
[1:17:10] where you came from where you're going
[1:17:11] knows what you're hiding and what you're
[1:17:14] exposing well he knows everything about
[1:17:16] you
[1:17:17] when you come to a place where you're
[1:17:20] naked before God you will come subject
[1:17:23] to the Lord himself
[1:17:25] you will do what God has revealed to you
[1:17:27] in your heart to know that this is how
[1:17:30] I'm going to receive my rapturing faith
[1:17:33] people think that they can just bypass
[1:17:36] God's program
[1:17:38] and go in the rapture
[1:17:40] if they're rebelling against God's
[1:17:42] program it shows that they're not even
[1:17:44] in the Rapture because the Rapture is a
[1:17:47] revelation
[1:17:49] Hallelujah and it's a revelation of the
[1:17:52] body of Christ and the supernatural body
[1:17:55] of Jesus Christ bringing his attributes
[1:17:59] all together into one body and what what
[1:18:03] happens when you try to bring
[1:18:05] a cancer into the body
[1:18:09] it starts to affect the body
[1:18:11] you think God's going to do that
[1:18:13] no no what God does is he removes the
[1:18:15] cancer brings it in
[1:18:17] that's what he did to you that's what he
[1:18:20] did to me
[1:18:21] before we when when we came to the Lord
[1:18:23] there was all kinds of Cancer all over
[1:18:25] us death
[1:18:27] it was all over our lives but God says
[1:18:30] I've called you for a purpose
[1:18:32] and when that purpose is established and
[1:18:35] you know
[1:18:36] that you know
[1:18:38] that God is God
[1:18:40] and he starts to work on you he starts
[1:18:42] to mold you he starts to shape you
[1:18:44] through the fivefold ministry he starts
[1:18:46] to give you Faith to recognize the body
[1:18:49] and that the body edifies itself
[1:18:51] the body nourishes the body how can how
[1:18:55] can a Believer be against believer
[1:18:59] there's something wrong
[1:19:00] there's something wrong there's a devil
[1:19:03] there that needs to be cast out burnt
[1:19:06] out and prayed out
[1:19:08] because God does not divide against
[1:19:11] himself
[1:19:12] anytime there's confusion in any kind of
[1:19:15] a situation in your walk with God let me
[1:19:18] tell you who the author of that
[1:19:19] confusion is
[1:19:21] Satan himself
[1:19:23] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:19:26] so here he says no they were revealed in
[1:19:28] the Seven Seals that's what the Thunders
[1:19:30] was about they was to reveal the seven
[1:19:33] Thunders that had uttered their voices
[1:19:35] and no one could make out what it was
[1:19:39] listen now John knew what it was
[1:19:44] but he was forbidden to write it
[1:19:47] so don't let anybody tell you that
[1:19:51] somebody's going to be coming along and
[1:19:52] is going to give the understanding and
[1:19:54] the Revelation on the seven Thunders
[1:19:57] okay it's already
[1:20:00] it's already there
[1:20:03] there's nothing to be looking for some
[1:20:05] other messenger the mighty Angel is the
[1:20:08] messenger the Eternal messenger of this
[1:20:11] hour for an eternal bride amen he's here
[1:20:14] right now his voice is calling out your
[1:20:17] name he's he's positionally placing you
[1:20:19] in the word of God by the word that's
[1:20:21] going forth and you're recognizing oh I
[1:20:24] see I see who I am I see my position in
[1:20:27] the word of God Amen John knew who it
[1:20:30] was but he was forbidden to write it he
[1:20:32] said but the seventh angel the seventh
[1:20:35] angel in the days of his sounding the
[1:20:39] seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders
[1:20:41] would be revealed and the seventh angel
[1:20:44] is a messenger of the seventh Church h c
[1:20:49] now a lot of people
[1:20:51] put that totally on brother Branham that
[1:20:55] he's the one that's revealing the
[1:20:57] Thunders no he was the Earthly angel
[1:21:02] in order to fulfill Revelations 10 7.
[1:21:06] it was the mighty Angel himself
[1:21:10] those seven angels that came down on
[1:21:12] Sunset mountain and told Brother Branham
[1:21:15] it was time for the opening of The Seven
[1:21:16] Seals it was Christ himself now coming
[1:21:20] to reveal and coming to bring forth
[1:21:23] rapturing faith for his church for his
[1:21:27] elect for the ones that he came to claim
[1:21:31] he was coming himself he was not going
[1:21:33] to put this in the hands of anybody
[1:21:35] Hallelujah glory to God Amen and brother
[1:21:39] Branham realized that recognize that and
[1:21:43] saw that it was the time
[1:21:46] it was the time
[1:21:48] that that that changed his whole life
[1:21:50] that he says it's a new Bible
[1:21:52] why do you think that when you came to
[1:21:55] the Lord
[1:21:56] and you started to read the word
[1:21:58] it was like wait a minute here
[1:22:01] I've I've read this before
[1:22:04] but I didn't see this before
[1:22:06] this is alive
[1:22:08] this this is for now
[1:22:10] this isn't for yesterday this is for now
[1:22:13] everything becomes now why because
[1:22:17] Christ is present he's Eternal there is
[1:22:21] no time or space in Christ
[1:22:23] you as a human being you put time and
[1:22:26] you put space on everything and that's
[1:22:29] why you get confused at times that's why
[1:22:31] you get discouraged at times you get
[1:22:34] discouraged with your flesh you get
[1:22:35] discouraged with your performance you
[1:22:37] get discouraged with your relationships
[1:22:39] but Christ he he's present
[1:22:43] he says he that's heavy laden let him
[1:22:46] come unto me I will give him rest now
[1:22:49] right now he can give you rest right now
[1:22:52] he can provide your needs right now
[1:22:55] because everything that you have need of
[1:22:57] is already in you
[1:23:00] if you've recognized this message this
[1:23:02] is a supernatural message this is not
[1:23:05] another Christian Church
[1:23:09] sermon
[1:23:11] this is Supernatural
[1:23:13] this is Christ himself come to call you
[1:23:17] out of your circumstances to give you
[1:23:20] Faith to overcome the circumstances amen
[1:23:23] hallelujah glory to God hallelujah thank
[1:23:27] you Jesus
[1:23:28] amen
[1:23:30] you know
[1:23:32] go to the next uh
[1:23:35] scripture
[1:23:36] some people were actually
[1:23:39] saying that brother Branham because of
[1:23:42] his Supernatural experiences and and how
[1:23:45] God was with him so much the
[1:23:46] supernatural that that they thought you
[1:23:49] know brother Brandon you you can write
[1:23:52] another book
[1:23:54] Beyond The Book of Revelation you could
[1:23:56] write another book you could add to the
[1:23:58] book based on what God has revealed to
[1:23:59] you but brother Branham knew that you
[1:24:02] could not add anything to the word
[1:24:05] there's nothing that you and I could
[1:24:07] possibly add to the word of God it's
[1:24:10] Eternal it's it it's perfect there's
[1:24:13] nothing that brother Branham could have
[1:24:15] added because it wasn't brother Branham
[1:24:18] it was Christ it was God interpreting
[1:24:20] his own word amen hallelujah but man's
[1:24:23] thinking uh you know but you cannot add
[1:24:26] and look at for I testify unto every man
[1:24:28] that heareth the words of the prophecy
[1:24:31] of this book If any man shall add unto
[1:24:33] these things God shall add unto him the
[1:24:36] plagues
[1:24:37] that are written in this book we're not
[1:24:40] looking to add anything
[1:24:42] we need to make that clear
[1:24:44] we're not looking for for any man's
[1:24:47] interpretation on this message we're
[1:24:50] looking for God to interpret it clearly
[1:24:52] to us as individuals
[1:24:55] and if any man shall take away from the
[1:24:57] words of the book of this prophecy God
[1:25:00] will take away his part out of the book
[1:25:03] of life and out of the holy city and
[1:25:06] from the things which are written in
[1:25:08] this book next slide listen William
[1:25:11] Branham eligible to write a Bible look
[1:25:14] look what he says now someone had been
[1:25:16] many has been saying to me and
[1:25:19] theologians said brother Branham if the
[1:25:22] Lord God said if if with your experience
[1:25:25] that the Lord has given you for his
[1:25:27] people humbly saying this said you'd be
[1:25:31] eligible to write a Bible yourself
[1:25:36] see what they didn't realize and what
[1:25:38] they were confused by
[1:25:40] was that
[1:25:42] he was the interpretation of the Bible
[1:25:45] and when people were seen
[1:25:48] the supernatural that was taking place
[1:25:50] in his life
[1:25:52] they were not seen that it was the word
[1:25:54] himself
[1:25:56] it was Christ in him it's always been
[1:25:59] Christ in the word
[1:26:02] it's any time that you are interpreting
[1:26:06] God's word if you get healed
[1:26:09] you're a written epistle
[1:26:10] at that moment you're a written epistle
[1:26:12] that can be read of all men because you
[1:26:15] are the interpretation of healing in the
[1:26:17] Bible
[1:26:19] when when when healing takes place in
[1:26:22] your life you're realizing that it's the
[1:26:24] word that's being interpreted in you
[1:26:27] that I am the Lord thy God that healeth
[1:26:30] all of your diseases he didn't leave any
[1:26:34] disease out he said all
[1:26:37] so all you've got to do is believe the
[1:26:40] word walk with the word know that you
[1:26:43] actually are
[1:26:45] the interpretation of the word in this
[1:26:48] day according to the revelation of the
[1:26:51] message of the hour okay because you
[1:26:54] need to come subject to the word you can
[1:26:57] never make yourself more than the word
[1:27:00] the word is interpreting himself through
[1:27:05] your life so brother Branham says here
[1:27:07] he says his people humbly saying that
[1:27:10] you could write your word that God has
[1:27:12] manifested I said that might be true see
[1:27:15] he was trying to catch me see and I said
[1:27:18] but you see I couldn't do that he said
[1:27:21] why couldn't you you have all the
[1:27:24] qualifications I said but you look one
[1:27:27] word cannot be added or taken away see
[1:27:32] and he said well then
[1:27:34] them seven Thunders you see said
[1:27:37] wouldn't them seven Thunders blasting
[1:27:39] out wouldn't that be a revelation be
[1:27:42] given to some man
[1:27:47] you see you see how the enemy wants to
[1:27:49] you know get you confused like we need
[1:27:52] to keep this simple okay I know we're
[1:27:55] talking about the Book of Revelations
[1:27:57] we're talking about some thunders we're
[1:27:59] talking about seals you know uh you know
[1:28:02] all these half hour of Silence when the
[1:28:05] seventh seal was we're looking at all
[1:28:06] these things but you need to understand
[1:28:08] like I said right at the very beginning
[1:28:11] we are not
[1:28:14] a common
[1:28:17] denominational Church
[1:28:20] we are
[1:28:22] the interpretation of the book of Acts
[1:28:26] being continued into the 21st century
[1:28:31] we need to recognize that the Book of
[1:28:33] Revelation just look at the name
[1:28:37] it's the Book of Revelation
[1:28:41] Revelation is something that is revealed
[1:28:45] it's an end time book it's all about the
[1:28:49] end time everything regarding the church
[1:28:54] in the end time
[1:28:56] what day are we living in
[1:28:59] the end time
[1:29:01] why are we reading these things why are
[1:29:04] we looking into these things because
[1:29:06] they pertain to the people that are in
[1:29:10] the end time
[1:29:12] we need to recognize the importance of
[1:29:15] these
[1:29:16] truths
[1:29:18] and so here now he says that it's all
[1:29:22] revealed in there no sir it would be
[1:29:26] adding something to it and taking
[1:29:28] something from it it's all revealed in
[1:29:31] there and the Seven Seals opened up the
[1:29:34] revelation of what that was
[1:29:39] Hallelujah so it's nothing new it's not
[1:29:44] something that that that that that is
[1:29:47] going to be revealed by somebody or some
[1:29:50] group of people or some pastors it's
[1:29:52] Christ himself
[1:29:55] it's still the word unveiling himself in
[1:29:59] this hour All Through the Ages men were
[1:30:02] guessing at it but in the days of the
[1:30:04] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:30:07] begin the sound the Mysteries would be
[1:30:09] finished
[1:30:10] and anybody that goes back and actually
[1:30:13] studies William Miriam Branham
[1:30:16] and looks into his life and his ministry
[1:30:19] they will see that he fulfilled exactly
[1:30:24] those scriptures of Malachi 4 5 Luke 17
[1:30:28] 30 Revelations 10 7.
[1:30:32] you will see it clearly in the word of
[1:30:35] God and it's important that people know
[1:30:38] that when you when you give a testimony
[1:30:41] about how God you know uh interceded in
[1:30:45] your life
[1:30:46] a part of your testimony
[1:30:48] is recognizing what God has done in your
[1:30:53] day what God has done through the
[1:30:56] Fulfillment of the scriptures and how
[1:30:58] William Miriam Branham was us was was
[1:31:00] that was an absolute element that you
[1:31:03] cannot leave it out
[1:31:05] because it's what leads us to where we
[1:31:08] are today
[1:31:09] it's it's because Christ was revealing
[1:31:12] his own word and he wants to do the
[1:31:15] exact same thing for you and me
[1:31:18] Hallelujah
[1:31:21] so it's already been written next slide
[1:31:24] in the Feast of the trumpets he said
[1:31:27] that this in that day that he see him
[1:31:32] come down
[1:31:34] and he eat up the little book
[1:31:37] and there was he put one foot on the
[1:31:39] land and one on the sea and swore by him
[1:31:42] that lives and ever and ever that time
[1:31:45] shall be no more and when he did seven
[1:31:50] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[1:31:52] the seven Thunders uttered their voices
[1:31:54] John said he was about to write and he
[1:31:57] said don't write it see and he sealed it
[1:32:00] what is it what it is is a revelation on
[1:32:05] what has been missed back there to bring
[1:32:09] it's already wrote here it's in here
[1:32:13] it's it's to reveal what's already been
[1:32:18] written in the word we're not adding
[1:32:21] nothing
[1:32:22] so you are written in the word
[1:32:25] you coming into your season and
[1:32:28] recognizing your day and its message is
[1:32:31] you coming into manifestation of the
[1:32:35] word for this day
[1:32:36] it's you recognizing that you're a part
[1:32:39] of this great Plan of Redemption
[1:32:42] Hallelujah because you can't add one
[1:32:45] thing to it or take one thing away from
[1:32:47] it Hallelujah everything is producing
[1:32:51] now rapturing Faith for the bride
[1:32:55] Hallelujah
[1:33:00] now let's go to the next slide
[1:33:04] and then there's coming forth
[1:33:06] seven mysterious Thunders that's not
[1:33:09] even written at all that's right and I
[1:33:13] believe that through those seven
[1:33:14] Thunders will be revealed in the last
[1:33:17] days in order to get the bride together
[1:33:20] for rapturing faith
[1:33:23] everything that was written under those
[1:33:26] seals
[1:33:28] has been released
[1:33:31] but there's something under the seventh
[1:33:34] seal
[1:33:35] that is now being released
[1:33:39] that's what we
[1:33:43] are focused on
[1:33:45] we already know what's under the six the
[1:33:48] first six seals it's history now
[1:33:51] it's not that it's history but it's
[1:33:52] going to be but we know what's going to
[1:33:54] be taking place we know that the the the
[1:33:56] the plagues we see the the the the white
[1:34:00] horse rider and what it's become today
[1:34:02] and we know where where it sits and we
[1:34:04] understand the the deception that's in
[1:34:07] the world that all would be deceived
[1:34:09] except those whose names were written in
[1:34:12] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:34:14] everybody's in a in a level of deception
[1:34:16] the Bible said all
[1:34:19] a-l-l how are we going to change that
[1:34:21] you can't change that I can't change
[1:34:23] that there's nothing that we can do to
[1:34:25] change that
[1:34:27] the whole world is under deception
[1:34:29] except if your name was written in the
[1:34:32] Lamb's Book of Life from before the
[1:34:34] foundations of the world
[1:34:36] people need to know this
[1:34:38] you talk about this and they go what do
[1:34:41] you mean all or you mean all the
[1:34:43] churches are deceived yeah
[1:34:46] all the churches he said all I don't
[1:34:49] know you want to read the scripture you
[1:34:50] you interpret it for me all are deceived
[1:34:54] except those who's written in the Lamb's
[1:34:56] Book of Life what's the Lamb's Book of
[1:34:59] Life
[1:34:59] well that's what that's what we've been
[1:35:02] given
[1:35:03] that's the that's the Revelation that
[1:35:05] we've been given that's what separates
[1:35:07] you from the rest of this Christian
[1:35:09] world
[1:35:11] that's what's separated listen when
[1:35:13] Jesus came to the Earth he walked with
[1:35:15] 12 disciples
[1:35:16] he walked with 12. there was there was
[1:35:19] there was hundreds of thousands millions
[1:35:21] of people on the Earth at the time but
[1:35:23] yet there was only a dozen people that
[1:35:25] actually recognized that the word was
[1:35:27] made flesh before them
[1:35:29] that the word was interpreting what it
[1:35:31] was supposed to produce in that day and
[1:35:34] they failed to recognize it
[1:35:37] well the same thing is happening today
[1:35:39] that's why when you're walking you know
[1:35:42] you humble you know simple but you've
[1:35:44] been given this Revelation on the
[1:35:46] message of this hour and you don't
[1:35:48] realize just what you are a carrier of
[1:35:51] you don't realize what's in you you
[1:35:53] don't realize that that you're going to
[1:35:55] be changed that you're not going to go
[1:35:57] you see the world falling apart all
[1:35:59] around you but you realize that because
[1:36:01] of the grace of God
[1:36:04] the spirit of God that raised Christ
[1:36:06] from the dead it's dwelling in you
[1:36:08] you've been awakened you've been born
[1:36:11] again that's what you know that's what
[1:36:13] the new birth is all about when the new
[1:36:15] birth takes place everything becomes new
[1:36:18] the Bible becomes new it becomes real
[1:36:21] Christ becomes real to you Hallelujah
[1:36:25] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:36:27] hallelujah he says and there's coming
[1:36:29] forth seven mysterious Thunders that not
[1:36:33] even written at all that's right in
[1:36:35] order to get the bride together for
[1:36:37] rapturing Faith because what we've got
[1:36:39] right now we wouldn't be able to do it
[1:36:43] a lot of people don't realize the
[1:36:46] importance
[1:36:48] of this Revelation on what God has done
[1:36:51] in our day in sending us a prophet in
[1:36:55] opening those Seven Seals in revealing
[1:36:57] the mystery truths that were written in
[1:37:00] the word of God people don't realize
[1:37:02] what's what's there they don't they
[1:37:04] don't they don't recognize why because
[1:37:06] they're not ordained to it but unto you
[1:37:09] it has been given to know these
[1:37:11] Mysteries
[1:37:12] unto you it has been given to know and
[1:37:14] look at Jesus he says but unto them it
[1:37:17] has not been given imagine
[1:37:19] this is the day that we're actually
[1:37:22] living in Hallelujah right together
[1:37:25] because what we got right now wouldn't
[1:37:27] be able to do it there's something we've
[1:37:30] got to step further we can't have enough
[1:37:33] faith for Divine Healing hardly we've
[1:37:36] got to have enough Faith to be changed
[1:37:38] in a moment and be swept up out of this
[1:37:41] Earth and we'll find that after a while
[1:37:44] the Lord willing will find where it's
[1:37:47] written amen hallelujah go to the next
[1:37:50] slide
[1:37:51] let's look at now the reason for the
[1:37:54] Thunders now there was some reason that
[1:37:56] God let this seven voices be thundered
[1:37:58] because it must come see for we find
[1:38:02] that Christ the lamb took the book in
[1:38:06] his hand and he opened that seventh seal
[1:38:08] but you see it's a hidden mystery no one
[1:38:11] knows it but it's right along with what
[1:38:14] he said no one would know his coming
[1:38:19] you see that seventh seal is actually
[1:38:22] the coming of Jesus Christ to the Earth
[1:38:24] a lot of people are way they're waiting
[1:38:27] on the coming of the Lord
[1:38:29] oh we're waiting on the coming he's
[1:38:31] going to come in a cloud guess what he
[1:38:34] already came in 1963.
[1:38:37] he already came in a cloud in 1963.
[1:38:40] and he's here right now claiming his
[1:38:42] possessions he's here right now maturing
[1:38:45] a church a bride a people he's he's now
[1:38:49] come into a a new age he's in an eternal
[1:38:52] age because he's an eternal messenger
[1:38:55] Hallelujah he's already come and they
[1:38:57] missed it you see the supernatural
[1:39:00] opening of that seventh seal was Christ
[1:39:02] himself coming to the Earth
[1:39:08] no one knows it but it's right along
[1:39:11] with what he said no one would know his
[1:39:13] coming they also would not know about
[1:39:15] this seven Thunder mystery so you see
[1:39:18] it's connected together that much we
[1:39:22] have an understanding of it today
[1:39:24] because the rest of it all unfolded but
[1:39:28] this is not unfolded but sitting in my
[1:39:32] room I heard this oh not heard it rather
[1:39:35] but seen it unfold to this seven
[1:39:39] Thunders see brother Branham he actually
[1:39:42] saw
[1:39:43] what was going on
[1:39:45] he realized that it was the time for
[1:39:49] Christ to come and claim his possessions
[1:39:51] he knew that's why he was such he was
[1:39:55] under such expert he could come tonight
[1:39:57] he realized that it had entered into
[1:39:59] that season it was Christ now himself
[1:40:02] the Mighty God himself had come down to
[1:40:05] claim his possessions to brother Branham
[1:40:07] that was now that was that was right now
[1:40:10] this this is going to happen right now
[1:40:12] but it wasn't yet because there was a
[1:40:15] bride that needed to be called
[1:40:18] he came to call those whose names were
[1:40:21] written in the book remember he came
[1:40:22] with the open book
[1:40:24] the book was open now he's releasing and
[1:40:28] calling the names that were written in
[1:40:30] the book
[1:40:32] aren't you glad that you heard your name
[1:40:36] aren't you thankful
[1:40:42] that he's come
[1:40:44] and that he's got a plan
[1:40:47] and that his desire
[1:40:49] is to call you
[1:40:51] and to place you
[1:40:53] and to use you for his glory amen
[1:40:56] but sitting in this room I heard this
[1:40:58] and and not heard it but rather seen it
[1:41:01] unfold to this seven Thunders now that's
[1:41:04] as far as we can go right there and now
[1:41:07] I trust that each and every one of you
[1:41:10] will serve God
[1:41:12] and we'll do that which is right
[1:41:15] love him
[1:41:16] all your life and serve him and God will
[1:41:19] take care of the rest go to the next
[1:41:22] slide and then when you see this coming
[1:41:25] to pass
[1:41:27] then know the time is nigh see Israel
[1:41:31] gathering in its own Homeland but you
[1:41:34] notice he omitted the revelation of this
[1:41:37] seventh seal
[1:41:38] he didn't give an interpretation on the
[1:41:42] seventh seal why did he not give an
[1:41:45] interpretation on the seventh seal
[1:41:47] because they were going to interpret
[1:41:50] themselves
[1:41:52] they were Satan has always been an
[1:41:55] impersonator
[1:41:57] he's always infiltrated the church and
[1:42:00] what does he do he gets the people off
[1:42:02] saying something gets them to pervert
[1:42:04] the word slightly enough that it just
[1:42:06] gets him off track and puts the Holy
[1:42:09] Spirit out of the church
[1:42:11] and Satan
[1:42:13] he's the same too he uses the same old
[1:42:15] tactics
[1:42:17] but God knew and said no
[1:42:21] I'm not going to allow this
[1:42:22] there's nothing to reveal here
[1:42:25] I'm going to reveal it by interpreting
[1:42:28] it I'm going to show that there's a
[1:42:31] people on the Earth that are going to
[1:42:33] manifest me
[1:42:35] in the form of a bride the true church
[1:42:38] there's a lot of churches out there that
[1:42:40] are claiming we're the bride of Christ
[1:42:42] we're the bride of Christ you can't be
[1:42:44] the bride of Christ unless God calls you
[1:42:47] unless God chose you listen when a woman
[1:42:50] goes and says I'm taking you as my
[1:42:52] husband that's a little bit
[1:42:55] perverted that's not the way it usually
[1:42:58] happens okay but we're living in a world
[1:43:00] where anything's possible now
[1:43:03] with Jesus all things are possible and
[1:43:05] with this world in the condition that
[1:43:06] it's in all things are possible too and
[1:43:09] we're witnessing it but that's not the
[1:43:12] way it works he chooses he says I chose
[1:43:16] you from before the foundations of the
[1:43:19] world it's not you chose him oh I went
[1:43:22] to The Altar and I gave my life to Jesus
[1:43:24] Christ and now I'm saved no that's not
[1:43:28] the way it works it's because God calls
[1:43:31] you God calls you by your name
[1:43:34] discerns your life exposes who you
[1:43:37] really are and that causes you to come
[1:43:40] to the Altar and repent and rejoice to
[1:43:43] know that your name has now been called
[1:43:45] Hallelujah that's what John was looking
[1:43:47] to hear he wanted to hear his name
[1:43:50] written in the book Hallelujah glory to
[1:43:52] God and that's what's taken place in
[1:43:54] your life it's because God chose you
[1:43:57] God God didn't want to any demon power
[1:44:01] to play around with his bride
[1:44:04] he wasn't going to let anybody pervert
[1:44:06] his his sons and daughters because he
[1:44:09] knew that this world would be in such a
[1:44:12] condition of total deception that they
[1:44:15] would themselves if it would even
[1:44:17] deceive the very elect imagine that kind
[1:44:20] of a deception that it would even
[1:44:22] deceive the very elect if it were
[1:44:25] possible
[1:44:26] but it's not possible
[1:44:28] because you're an attribute of God
[1:44:31] Hallelujah glory to God
[1:44:34] he says here therefore we're this far
[1:44:37] and the rest of it will be known right
[1:44:39] around about the time that Jesus appears
[1:44:42] on Earth again
[1:44:44] he's here
[1:44:46] he's here Saints
[1:44:47] appears for his bride
[1:44:50] or whatever takes place at that time now
[1:44:53] until that time let's just all pray live
[1:44:55] good straight Christian lives looking
[1:44:58] forward for his coming Hallelujah
[1:45:01] blessed be the name of the Lord glory to
[1:45:04] God Amen
[1:45:06] blessed be his wonderful name listen
[1:45:08] here as we wind down here
[1:45:11] uh
[1:45:14] brother Branham speaking here
[1:45:17] in an exposition of the seven Church
[1:45:19] ages
[1:45:22] the laodicean age a momentary
[1:45:24] consideration of church history will
[1:45:26] prove
[1:45:28] how accurate this thought is
[1:45:31] in the Dark Ages the word was almost
[1:45:34] entirely lost to the people now we're
[1:45:37] talking a little bit about
[1:45:39] Christian Church History here
[1:45:42] but God sent Luther with the word
[1:45:46] the Catholic Church basically had
[1:45:48] control over the word
[1:45:50] in the Dark Ages
[1:45:52] and they were controlling and there was
[1:45:53] there was so much done there was there
[1:45:56] was millions of Christians that were
[1:45:58] that were slaughtered okay under the
[1:46:02] hand of religious organized churches
[1:46:07] and
[1:46:09] the word was now going to
[1:46:13] reform itself and bring itself to where
[1:46:17] we are today
[1:46:18] I want you to see something God sent
[1:46:20] Luther
[1:46:21] with the word
[1:46:23] the Lutheran spoke for God at that time
[1:46:27] remember any time that God goes into a
[1:46:30] messenger it's the voice of God speaking
[1:46:32] through that messenger
[1:46:34] to call out the elect of that age
[1:46:39] we need to understand a bit of this
[1:46:40] church history so that we can understand
[1:46:42] where we are today
[1:46:44] but they organized and again the pure
[1:46:48] word was lost for organization tends
[1:46:51] towards dogma and Creeds and not the
[1:46:55] simple word
[1:46:58] they could no longer speak for God
[1:47:02] then God sent Wesley and was The Voice
[1:47:06] with the word in his day
[1:47:10] because they organized under Luther
[1:47:14] God sends Wesley
[1:47:16] to speak his word to bring them one step
[1:47:19] further the people who took his
[1:47:22] Revelation from God became living
[1:47:24] Epistles read and known of all men for
[1:47:27] their generation
[1:47:28] when the methodists filled God raised up
[1:47:31] others and so it has gone on through the
[1:47:34] years until this last day there is again
[1:47:37] another people in the land who under
[1:47:41] their messenger
[1:47:43] will be the final voice to the final age
[1:47:48] so we need to realize Who We Are
[1:47:51] the importance of our calling for us to
[1:47:55] recognize who we are in the word of God
[1:47:58] puts us into a position of perfect faith
[1:48:01] in the word of God
[1:48:03] and Supernatural things will just happen
[1:48:06] around your life
[1:48:08] things will fall away
[1:48:10] your obedience to the word of God you're
[1:48:13] you're coming subject to the word of God
[1:48:15] you attending Services you pain your
[1:48:18] tithes you loving your brothers and
[1:48:21] sisters you participating as a member of
[1:48:24] the church you being an usher you being
[1:48:26] a trustee you being a deacon you being a
[1:48:29] prayer Warrior whatever God has placed
[1:48:31] you in the body of Christ to do that is
[1:48:35] your perfect faith for perfect
[1:48:38] Revelation in order to receive rapturing
[1:48:40] faith
[1:48:42] it's as simple as that
[1:48:44] don't be looking for some great thing
[1:48:47] that you need to do all you need to do
[1:48:50] is come under subjection to the word of
[1:48:52] God and you become the final voice for
[1:48:56] the final age
[1:48:58] yes sir the church is no longer the most
[1:49:00] peace of God it is its own mouthpiece
[1:49:05] God is his own mouthpiece in this day
[1:49:08] and in this hour it's not going to be
[1:49:10] any man that you're going to follow
[1:49:12] you're not going to follow any man
[1:49:14] whatsoever you're not going to be
[1:49:16] looking from for some other messenger
[1:49:18] you're not going to be looking to to
[1:49:20] follow some certainty oh you only got to
[1:49:23] listen to the tapes no you don't only
[1:49:25] got to listen to the tapes you do need
[1:49:28] to listen to the tapes but you do also
[1:49:30] need to come under subjection to the
[1:49:32] five-fold ministry where the mighty
[1:49:34] Angel himself can speak and discern your
[1:49:37] situation for this week
[1:49:40] for this week for next week for tomorrow
[1:49:43] for today
[1:49:44] to heal you and provide for you what you
[1:49:47] have need of
[1:49:48] that's the supernatural element that's
[1:49:51] available to you as a son or daughter of
[1:49:55] God
[1:49:56] and he says here yes
[1:49:58] he says so God is turning on her he will
[1:50:02] confound her through the prophet and the
[1:50:04] bride
[1:50:05] he's talking about this age
[1:50:07] that this whole age that are claiming
[1:50:10] Christianity claiming that they know God
[1:50:12] they haven't come to this Revelation and
[1:50:15] until they do Unfortunately they get
[1:50:19] left behind and they go into the
[1:50:22] tribulation
[1:50:24] that's what the word says that's not
[1:50:26] what I'm telling you
[1:50:27] Hallelujah he will confound her through
[1:50:30] the prophet and the bride for the voice
[1:50:33] of God will be in her yes it is for it
[1:50:36] says in the last chapter of Revelations
[1:50:38] verse 17 the spirit and the bride say
[1:50:42] come once more the world will hear
[1:50:45] direct from God as at Pentecost but of
[1:50:49] course that word bride will be
[1:50:52] repudiated as in the first age so don't
[1:50:58] expect people to just accept what you're
[1:51:01] saying
[1:51:02] God sent the prophet what do you mean
[1:51:04] God sent a prophet God sent lots of
[1:51:06] prophets no no God sent us a prophet in
[1:51:08] this day
[1:51:10] you need to recognize
[1:51:12] the importance of that
[1:51:15] because it leads us into our day
[1:51:18] and us having the ability to recognize
[1:51:20] who we are in the word of God
[1:51:23] amen
[1:51:24] glory to God
[1:51:26] go to the next slide
[1:51:38] so what actually happens
[1:51:41] when we awaken
[1:51:44] what is it that's actually happening
[1:51:47] we've heard from our theophany
[1:51:50] remember the attribute of God
[1:51:53] is what God is taking
[1:51:58] the attribute of God
[1:52:01] is your theophany if this Earthly
[1:52:03] Tabernacle be dissolved God has another
[1:52:07] one waiting
[1:52:08] so when you come
[1:52:11] into the revelation of this message
[1:52:15] and you see it
[1:52:16] I see it
[1:52:19] I recognize it
[1:52:21] it's God
[1:52:23] I'm a Son of God I'm Justified as though
[1:52:26] I never did it in the first place
[1:52:29] God is going to glorify this body God's
[1:52:32] going to change this body
[1:52:34] you've come into direct contact with
[1:52:37] your theophany the attribute of God
[1:52:39] that's in you then after you recognize
[1:52:42] the very word of God was Eagle food then
[1:52:45] you left the other things you see
[1:52:48] everything else just Falls away from you
[1:52:49] you've then been formed into the living
[1:52:52] image of the Living God you heard from
[1:52:55] your theophany if this Earthly body be
[1:52:59] dissolved we have one waiting
[1:53:03] feel like you need to understand the
[1:53:06] process of the rapture it's not
[1:53:09] something that's impossible it's
[1:53:11] something that's going to happen and all
[1:53:14] God is going to do is translate the
[1:53:16] theophany the attribute that's in you
[1:53:19] into that other dimension and you're
[1:53:21] going to be in full contact and actually
[1:53:24] that theophany is going to come down and
[1:53:27] take these bodies and transform them and
[1:53:30] turn them into
[1:53:32] Supernatural bodies because we're going
[1:53:35] to be coming back to this Earth for
[1:53:37] another Thousand Years
[1:53:38] and you're going to need a body on this
[1:53:40] Earth for another Thousand Years except

[1:59:40] Brian Max's life
[1:59:42] as brandani said when one sinner
[1:59:46] repented all the Heavenly hosts rejoice
[1:59:50] so if you are rejoicing the Heavenly
[1:59:52] Host let's give God Applause
[1:59:58] amen
[1:59:59] okay without wasting much time I read
[2:00:02] couple of scriptures then after I finish
[2:00:04] we pray that we go inside the water
[2:00:09] our first scripture will come from
[2:00:13] say look
[2:00:17] chapter 24 verse 47-49
[2:00:30] .
[2:00:37] in Luke chapter 24 verse 47 to 29
[2:00:46] .
[2:00:47] amen
[2:00:49] and that repentance and remission of
[2:00:52] sins
[2:00:54] should be preached in his name among all
[2:00:58] nations beginning that Jerusalem
[2:01:02] and ye are witnesses of these things and
[2:01:05] behold I send the promise of my father
[2:01:09] upon you
[2:01:10] better ye in the city of Jerusalem until
[2:01:14] ye be and you retire from on high and in
[2:01:18] Colossians 3 17.
[2:01:27] Colossians chapter 3 verse 17.
[2:01:33] it says that
[2:01:35] everything you do in works or indeed do
[2:01:39] it in my name
[2:01:41] and then the last that means that the
[2:01:44] name is very important he said
[2:01:45] everything you do in works or indeed do
[2:01:49] it in my name giving thanks to God and
[2:01:53] the father by him so everything should
[2:01:56] be in his name in the name of Jesus
[2:01:59] every knee shall bow offense in heaven
[2:02:02] and on Earth that name is above all
[2:02:05] names and in Acts chapter 2 verse 37 to
[2:02:09] 38
[2:02:10] they asked Peter men and Brethren what
[2:02:14] shall we do and he said repent
[2:02:18] every one of you and be baptized in the
[2:02:21] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[2:02:23] of sins and Nisha received the gift of
[2:02:27] the Holy Ghost
[2:02:29] amen so upon this word it means that if
[2:02:33] you generally repent which our brother
[2:02:35] has done
[2:02:36] and we baptized in Jesus name God will
[2:02:40] fill him with his spirit so you can go
[2:02:42] inside the water now and then we pray
[2:03:05] can you all join me whilst we pray for
[2:03:07] our brother
[2:03:10] can all join me who has the profile
[2:03:13] brother
[2:03:14] oh a Heavenly most gracious Eternal God
[2:03:19] your word clearly said that when one
[2:03:21] repented all the Heavenly hosts is
[2:03:25] rejoiced Lord as the words came forth
[2:03:28] that no one comes to you except you call
[2:03:31] him and your name their names are
[2:03:33] written the Lamb's Book of Life before
[2:03:35] the foundations of the world oh God we
[2:03:39] know that baptism doesn't save but it's
[2:03:42] an outward expressing what has already
[2:03:44] taken place inside the brother that's
[2:03:48] expressing for the people to see oh God
[2:03:51] know him very well that you promise that
[2:03:54] when the people repent gently from their
[2:03:57] hearts and be baptized in your name you
[2:04:01] fill them with your Holy Ghost as we
[2:04:04] come in to baptize the brother father I
[2:04:07] pray that your great Holy Ghost will
[2:04:10] come
[2:04:10] and fill him with yourself so that he
[2:04:13] won't be the same person
[2:04:15] but from today
[2:04:17] gonna be a new person and live a new
[2:04:21] life amen
[2:04:23] okay but I'm asked you came here by your
[2:04:27] own free will
[2:04:29] today yes
[2:04:31] no but is it your free your own free
[2:04:34] will
[2:04:36] and do you renounce Satan and all his
[2:04:39] activities
[2:04:40] okay so upon confession of your faith
[2:04:43] I'm going to baptize you in the name of
[2:04:46] Jesus Christ the name above all names
[2:04:48] the names that demon fear and tremble
[2:04:51] amen that name
[2:04:53] will cast out everything amen okay come
[2:04:57] a little bit forward
[2:05:03] neither
[2:05:07] and then bring yourself down
[2:05:15] baptized in Jesus name upon confession
[2:05:18] praise the Lord
[2:05:21] [Applause]
[2:05:23] praise God Heavenly Father we pray that
[2:05:27] your holy spirit will move in his life
[2:05:29] in a marvelous and in a wonderful way we
[2:05:33] commit him into your Divine hands For
[2:05:35] Your Glory and fear honor in the name of
