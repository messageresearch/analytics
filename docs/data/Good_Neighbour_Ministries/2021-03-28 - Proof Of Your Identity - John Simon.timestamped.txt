[1:10] together
[1:11] as one family in his name
[1:15] we are together again just praising the
[1:19] lord
[1:20] giving glory to his marvelous name
[1:23] once again we will read from our
[1:26] scriptures we will read from the book of
[1:30] acts
[1:31] chapter 19
[1:35] verses 11 to 17.
[1:40] shall we read god's word
[1:43] now and god
[1:48] wrought special miracles
[1:51] by the hands of paul
[1:55] so that from his body
[1:58] were brought unto the sick
[2:01] and kerchiefs or aprons
[2:05] and the dis diseases departed
[2:09] from them and the evil spirits
[2:13] went out of them then
[2:16] certain of the vagabond jews
[2:21] took upon them to call over them
[2:25] which had evil spirits the name
[2:29] of the lord jesus saying
[2:32] we're journey by jesus whom paul
[2:35] preached
[2:36] and there were seven sons of one skiva
[2:40] a jew and chief of the priests
[2:43] which did so and the evil spirit
[2:46] answered and said jesus i know
[2:50] and paul i know but who are you
[2:56] and the man in whom the evil spirit
[3:00] was leapt on them
[3:04] and overcame them and
[3:07] prevailed against them so
[3:10] that they fled out of the house
[3:14] naked and wounded
[3:17] and this was known to all the jews
[3:21] and greeks also dwelling
[3:25] at ephesus and fear
[3:28] fell upon them all and the
[3:32] name of the lord jesus
[3:36] was magnified
[3:39] glory be to god let us pray
[3:44] righteous loving merciful
[3:49] heavenly father we adore thee
[3:53] we bow down before thee
[3:56] and we give these thanks and praise
[4:00] for this wonderful morning
[4:03] and for the grace that we are here
[4:07] to see another day
[4:10] and to worship you lord we ask your
[4:14] divine assistance we ask you
[4:18] to reveal yourself to us you being the
[4:21] word
[4:23] make known to us the treasures
[4:26] of the wisdom and the knowledge
[4:29] of the lord jesus christ and may you
[4:33] lord transfer this wisdom this knowledge
[4:36] this
[4:36] understanding this anointing this
[4:39] revelation of
[4:40] this name to your people profusely
[4:44] father
[4:45] may you pour out your holy spirit
[4:48] upon all they that will hear the word
[4:53] around the world whatever nation
[4:56] whatever land
[4:57] whatever time for your glory father
[5:01] to see be all the praise in
[5:04] jesus name as we lift him up
[5:08] to your glory amen praise be the god
[5:12] now we have just read from the book of
[5:15] acts
[5:17] this remarkable story about the
[5:21] seven sons of skiva
[5:25] we can clearly see that those
[5:28] devils that had possessed
[5:32] this man that they
[5:35] were attempting to exercise or cast
[5:38] the devil out of that
[5:41] these devils in this man
[5:45] knew jesus and
[5:48] they knew paul the
[5:51] absolutely knew who they were
[5:56] the question that was asked of the sons
[5:59] of skiva
[6:00] was a question of identification
[6:04] and that is what this sermon is going to
[6:08] be
[6:08] about proof of your
[6:12] identity proof
[6:15] of your identity that is of your
[6:19] spiritual identification and
[6:22] this is what these devils were inquiring
[6:26] of these sons of skiva about
[6:31] because they wanted to know who are you
[6:35] uh jesus we know he has a reputation in
[6:38] hell
[6:39] uh paul we know he has a
[6:42] a a reputation in hell
[6:46] but we've never heard your name we don't
[6:48] know you we don't
[6:50] recognize you there is nothing
[6:52] that we can recognize you by yeah
[6:56] there you see so their spiritual
[7:00] identification
[7:02] was questionable hence the question
[7:07] uh jesus i know paul i
[7:10] know they're clearly identified to us
[7:14] but what's the proof of your identity uh
[7:17] who are you you say you come in the name
[7:19] of jesus
[7:20] but do you have any mark do you have any
[7:23] proof
[7:24] do you have any uh anything to show
[7:28] us that we might know that you are
[7:31] indeed
[7:33] who you claim you are
[7:36] amen you see so they were asking
[7:40] for some proof of their
[7:44] spiritual identity before
[7:47] complying with their
[7:50] authority that they were attempting
[7:54] to exercise let me repeat that again
[8:00] these demons wanted to be
[8:04] certain about their
[8:07] spiritual identities
[8:11] before they would comply to their
[8:15] authority praise god it's just as if you
[8:18] are in the street and
[8:20] some no name person some guy
[8:23] some lady some anyone came
[8:27] up to you and we're trying to exercise
[8:30] the authority of a policeman
[8:34] and you will ask them who are you uh
[8:37] you're not in uniform
[8:40] you don't have any id or identification
[8:43] you have no number
[8:47] you have nothing by which i can identify
[8:50] who you are i am not saying i will obey
[8:53] the law
[8:54] but i need to see your identification
[8:58] this is what these demons were
[9:01] asking of these sons of skiva
[9:04] right who are you and they
[9:08] were supposed to be able to identify
[9:12] who they were praise god
[9:15] but there were not they were not certain
[9:17] of god
[9:18] they didn't know themselves who they
[9:21] were
[9:22] and here there were at this time
[9:25] being asked this question and that's
[9:28] what this sermon is about
[9:30] it's based on this question
[9:33] that was asked of the sons of skiva when
[9:36] they
[9:37] had no answer because they did not know
[9:41] who they were
[9:42] and they were guessing or presuming
[9:47] about what they were actually
[9:50] doing all they had
[9:54] was a name
[9:57] and it was a name that they had heard
[10:00] from someone else
[10:04] all they had was knowledge
[10:08] and proven detailed information
[10:13] documented information
[10:17] of someone else's supernatural
[10:21] experience my friends
[10:25] this is actually what is taking place
[10:28] today
[10:30] where people are basing their lives
[10:32] their ministries
[10:34] their churches and it's based my friends
[10:39] on their knowledge
[10:42] and they do know they may be prolific in
[10:45] their knowledge of what they know
[10:48] proven detailed documented
[10:52] information knowledge about this
[10:56] individual's supernatural
[10:59] experiences and the power of god the
[11:03] presence of the lord
[11:04] that moved individual which they might
[11:07] have seen on a video
[11:09] read in a book uh heard on a tape
[11:13] or watched it on television
[11:16] but you see they had not experienced
[11:20] that
[11:20] themselves they had no real
[11:24] knowledge of their own they were going
[11:27] by
[11:27] someone else's supernatural
[11:30] experience amen they had heard
[11:36] someone else preach
[11:40] but they had never surrendered to it
[11:43] so therefore they had no identification
[11:45] with it
[11:47] but yet they were still trying to use
[11:51] the authority credibility and anointing
[11:54] of that preaching
[11:56] they were trying to use that to be able
[12:00] to enhance them
[12:03] themselves the in the eyes of the public
[12:08] see they were testing
[12:12] testing and experimenting
[12:16] and presuming with the word of god
[12:21] that they had heard they were just
[12:24] presuming
[12:25] and experimenting with the word paul
[12:29] had preached and paul had used in prayer
[12:32] the name jesus that paul had used
[12:37] in expelling demonic powers
[12:40] out of those that were suffering blind
[12:44] deaf dumb crippled all
[12:47] manner of sicknesses and sorrows they
[12:50] had
[12:51] over and over seen and heard
[12:54] paul use the mighty name of jesus christ
[13:00] and they were now taking that very name
[13:04] of jesus and they were
[13:08] experimenting with it
[13:10] to see if by the use of this
[13:14] name which they thought was just the
[13:16] magic word
[13:17] that they could rebuke and expel
[13:21] demons successfully and
[13:24] build their so-called business
[13:28] for they were having it as a business
[13:31] well my friends every age
[13:35] and every generation must
[13:39] face this same challenge where the devil
[13:43] will
[13:43] come and challenge us after
[13:46] this message that we are claiming to
[13:49] preach
[13:51] we're planning to declare many are
[13:54] telling the wonderful
[13:56] marvelous uh heart-stopping stories
[14:00] of how god used the prophet
[14:03] william marion branham and indeed
[14:07] it's wonderful it's beyond
[14:11] human imagination or human intelligence
[14:16] it's god using a man
[14:19] beyond our imagination
[14:23] read the book a man sent from
[14:26] god read the book
[14:29] the 20th century prophet
[14:33] read my friends beyond the curtain of
[14:37] time
[14:38] when he was caught up into the presence
[14:41] of almighty god
[14:43] yes many of these things are beyond our
[14:47] human
[14:48] senses but here they
[14:51] my friends many today are going by the
[14:55] documented uh detailed knowledge
[14:59] all the available information about this
[15:02] our dear
[15:03] brother uh and prophet for this 20th
[15:07] century
[15:08] and basing their entire lives
[15:11] and ministries on that that they can
[15:15] take whatever is in there
[15:18] and use that presume about it
[15:22] guess about it my friends experiment
[15:26] with different parts of it trying to see
[15:30] if they will get the same effect as
[15:33] brother branham had not knowing
[15:36] this is not something you're and and
[15:40] and scheme and manipulate and prove or
[15:43] it's not some kind of a actor or
[15:46] something
[15:47] you have to learn or something you're
[15:50] going to
[15:50] find out or discover this is the
[15:54] real genuine last day
[15:57] power of god making itself manifest
[16:01] through the prophet of god through god's
[16:04] servant
[16:05] in this day in this hour or praise god's
[16:08] wonderful name
[16:10] so every age
[16:13] will have a face this challenge
[16:16] by satan as to who you
[16:20] are where you come from
[16:23] and where you are going proof
[16:26] of your spiritual identification
[16:30] are you are you a gene of god
[16:34] are you a germ of god you're origin
[16:38] is it after his kind are you
[16:41] after his seed are you
[16:45] one of his original thoughts
[16:48] are you one of the names
[16:52] written in the lamb's book of life
[16:56] from before the foundation of the world
[17:00] friends we are not here to promote
[17:04] ourselves amen
[17:07] and we must not just promote ourselves
[17:11] as disciples followers
[17:14] and heirs amen of
[17:17] anointed men of god who might have gone
[17:20] before
[17:22] of whom particularly i speak about this
[17:25] prophet
[17:26] because he is the gentile prophet
[17:30] for this generation that god sent
[17:33] to this hour to this people
[17:36] to call out the people for his name
[17:39] out of egypt spiritually speaking which
[17:42] is denominationalism
[17:44] come out of her my people found in the
[17:47] book of revelation
[17:48] come out of her my people because why
[17:52] god is going to judge her like he's
[17:54] stoned jesse bell
[17:55] like he made dogs lick her blood
[17:59] he said i'm going to judge her i don't
[18:02] want you to be a partaker of her
[18:05] judgments
[18:06] of her plagues that i'm going to bring
[18:08] upon
[18:09] her so come out dissociate yourself
[18:13] walk away from it and walk into the
[18:16] glorious liberty of jesus christ
[18:20] our lord hallelujah amen so
[18:23] we are not to walk around as if we are
[18:26] we are inherited something
[18:28] from the prophet of god
[18:33] we must not walk around as if we
[18:36] are here inheriting his power his
[18:40] life his holiness his walk
[18:43] anything whatsoever from him
[18:46] but certainly we must
[18:49] be like them we must live like them
[18:52] we must act like them walk like them
[18:56] satan is still saying today not just to
[18:59] those sons of skiva
[19:01] that were back there but he is still
[19:03] saying today in
[19:05] our day jesus i know paul
[19:11] i know william branham
[19:14] oh yes i know oh my
[19:18] uh william branham you mean the promised
[19:21] prophet of malachi chapter
[19:24] 4 verse 5 i i know
[19:28] him i had many a battle with
[19:31] william branham and in his meetings
[19:34] and i was defeated by him so
[19:38] many times i remember one time
[19:41] in the united states of america
[19:45] this little man five feet four
[19:49] i met him on a stage and i met him
[19:53] in the person of us of a above
[19:57] six foot 250 pound man
[20:02] under my influence of demon possession
[20:05] ran up to the platform with his hands
[20:09] outstretched
[20:11] his fingers like this ready to grab a
[20:15] hold of him
[20:16] and ran up to the platform on the pulpit
[20:20] and was about to grab him while saying
[20:23] these words
[20:24] i'm gonna break every bone in your body
[20:28] i'm gonna tear you limb from them
[20:31] and as he said that he was roaring
[20:34] he was going to tear brother branham
[20:37] limb from limb like that
[20:40] and as he ran up to the platform the
[20:43] deacons were about to
[20:45] go to restrain him but brother branham
[20:48] raised his hand
[20:49] as if to say no stand back and as the
[20:52] gentleman
[20:53] came up why shouldn't say gentleman as
[20:56] this
[20:56] fierce and ferocious demon-possessed
[21:00] individual accosted the prophet
[21:04] and about to grab a hold of him by the
[21:07] truth
[21:08] and to trackle him brother brenham stood
[21:11] there
[21:13] and said because you have challenged me
[21:16] as a servant of the living god
[21:22] in the name of jesus christ
[21:25] you must not you will now fall at my
[21:28] feet
[21:29] and he fall at your feet and he was
[21:32] carrying on like that
[21:34] about to grab him but the crowd noticed
[21:37] that he kept punching
[21:38] and he couldn't touch brother branham he
[21:40] wasn't touching him he tried grabbing
[21:43] and his hand couldn't grab a hold of
[21:45] nothing and after a while
[21:48] and before you know it he fell on
[21:52] his face at brother brandon's feet
[21:56] and then they took him and dealt with
[21:59] him
[22:00] afterwards yes
[22:04] william branham i know because i met him
[22:09] in germany he left america
[22:12] where he was born i don't know why he
[22:16] never stayed there
[22:17] but he flew all the way over to germany
[22:20] and was having
[22:21] meetings there and in those meetings
[22:26] i felt i'm gonna make a mess of these
[22:29] meetings
[22:30] and show him up for a fraud i'm gonna
[22:33] show him up
[22:34] that he's not a real prophet and so
[22:37] i got my wizards and my witches
[22:41] together and brought several of them
[22:43] into his meeting
[22:45] and they began and with their feathers
[22:49] and their smoke and their spells
[22:51] all of a sudden the wind
[22:54] started coming to that tent trying to
[22:58] lift it up
[22:59] and the skies become dark and the
[23:03] howling of the wind the crowd became
[23:06] scared and worried about this
[23:09] but brethren says no don't be afraid
[23:15] he turned to those witches and wizards
[23:19] and said in the name of the father
[23:22] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[23:25] go from this place and stop you what you
[23:28] are doing
[23:29] they never even stopped they did not
[23:32] even have any s stoppage pause or
[23:36] anything when he used the name of father
[23:40] son and holy ghost he said then
[23:43] in the name of jesus christ
[23:46] i command you to cease what you are
[23:49] doing
[23:51] now let the winds go back
[23:54] and let the sun come out to shine
[23:58] glory to god hallelujah the winds the
[24:01] crowds heard the winds going
[24:03] and going back and all of a sudden out
[24:06] of the darkened mid-air the darkness
[24:10] daytime uh element
[24:14] came the light of the sun
[24:17] true glory to god and the meeting went
[24:20] on
[24:21] the devil was once again defeated
[24:24] so if satan were here he would say it
[24:28] william branham oh yeah i know i know
[24:32] him he left germany and went over there
[24:35] flew to sweden to finland
[24:39] and there in finland he had prophesied
[24:42] two years before that he saw this vision
[24:47] of a boy in the middle of the street
[24:50] with a bike dead and that god would use
[24:55] him
[24:56] to raise the dead from the
[24:59] middle of the street now brother branham
[25:02] was coming
[25:03] going to a meeting and while he was on
[25:06] his way to the meeting
[25:08] that was close to the russian border
[25:12] and at that time russian troops were on
[25:15] the walls
[25:16] and as he drove around the corner
[25:19] there was a was a boy
[25:22] lying in the middle of the street hit by
[25:26] a vehicle and was
[25:28] dead laying in the street
[25:32] and as he came some of the brethren who
[25:35] had that
[25:36] written in their bibles two years before
[25:40] looked and saw that it was the same
[25:43] scenery
[25:44] described by the servant of god
[25:47] he got out of the car and went to the
[25:50] boy
[25:52] laid his hands upon him
[25:55] the spirit of death in the name of jesus
[25:58] christ
[25:59] up comes the lad jumped up and without
[26:03] asking any question whatsoever
[26:07] he took his he had the wheel of a
[26:10] bicycle with the stick that he was
[26:12] running down the road and he just took
[26:14] that and up the road he
[26:16] went he delivered by the power of
[26:20] god from the grasp of death those
[26:23] russian soldiers on the wall began to
[26:26] weep and cry oh my if there's a god like
[26:30] that i'll believe that
[26:32] amen my friends yes so the devil said
[26:35] yes william branham i
[26:38] know amen but who are you
[26:45] who are you my friends
[26:48] we must pray like he prayed we must
[26:52] believe god like he believed god
[26:55] we must live like he lived
[26:58] and we must preach the word in faith
[27:01] like he preached
[27:02] the word of the living god hallelujah
[27:06] then and only then are we going to see
[27:09] the hand of god i tell you
[27:13] my br my brothers and sisters perfect
[27:16] faith
[27:18] cannot be inherited the power of the
[27:21] holy ghost
[27:23] the genuine anointing of god cannot
[27:27] be inherited genuine gifts
[27:31] and callings of god cannot
[27:35] be inherited there is no
[27:39] such a thing in the bible as apostolic
[27:43] succession
[27:45] there is no such thing in the bible
[27:48] as prophetic succession
[27:52] i'm quoting brother branham himself
[27:55] out of the seven church ages
[27:59] salvation is not passed on
[28:03] by natural birth any more
[28:07] than there is any truth to apostolic
[28:12] succession it is not
[28:16] in the word in the message call
[28:20] of the seven church ages again the
[28:22] ephesian church age
[28:24] oh how far have we wondered
[28:27] from the first church pentecost is
[28:31] nowhere in view and the word cannot be
[28:35] found apostolic succession
[28:39] which today abounds
[28:43] is not found in the word of god
[28:47] it is a man-made device
[28:51] it supersedes illegally
[28:54] the word of god the truth
[28:58] of god not man
[29:01] it for his god has set in the church
[29:04] not man has set their own leaders
[29:08] in the church but god
[29:11] has said in the church and not even the
[29:15] truth
[29:15] when they say peter was in rome peter
[29:19] was not even
[29:20] in rome so there is no such a thing
[29:23] as apostolic succession
[29:26] we are just surrounded by lies
[29:31] given by religious rascals vagabonds to
[29:34] the revealed
[29:35] word of god for this day and time
[29:39] amen yes sir i tell you
[29:43] when elijah and elisha
[29:47] were coming to coming at that time
[29:52] elisha already knew everything about
[29:54] elijah
[29:56] just like many of us today knows
[29:59] everything about
[30:00] brother branham the time he was born
[30:03] what happened
[30:04] they know him to the very
[30:07] detailed information about his life
[30:11] elijah knew all that about elijah
[30:15] for he was a servant
[30:18] but when elijah came to the jordan
[30:22] when he came to the gap when he had to
[30:25] cross
[30:25] from the ages into the capstone
[30:29] he did not need to impress
[30:33] neither god or satan of how much he
[30:36] knew about elijah
[30:39] but he did have to know god himself
[30:44] for himself he needed to know
[30:47] the lord god of elijah the jehovah of
[30:50] miracles
[30:51] he did not ask where is elijah
[30:55] he said where is the god of elijah
[30:58] hallelujah and he slapped the waters
[31:01] amen
[31:02] with the mantle that elijah o praise god
[31:06] had given unto him amen praise god
[31:10] and that was not a physic just a
[31:12] physical object
[31:13] it was a symbol praise god
[31:16] of the holy spirit that you needed to
[31:20] have
[31:20] if you want to do the things i did
[31:23] that's what
[31:24] elijah was trying to praise to him
[31:26] praise
[31:27] god hallelujah amen yes sir
[31:30] and so there is no such a thing
[31:34] as apostolic succession and when the
[31:38] train came
[31:40] god had to speak
[31:43] to joshua himself it was
[31:46] god who said to joshua in joshua
[31:50] chapter 1 verse 2 moses my
[31:53] servant is dead we might as well read
[31:57] this as saying
[31:59] william branham my servant is
[32:02] dead now you must arise
[32:06] and go over this jordan hallelujah
[32:09] if you have got to do it it's you
[32:12] that must cross this jordan by
[32:15] faith in god and by the leadership
[32:19] of the blessed holy spirit amen
[32:23] paul did not get his apostleship from
[32:25] peter
[32:27] he got it from god himself
[32:30] in the book of acts the bible tells us
[32:33] how god spoke in the night to the
[32:36] prophet ananias
[32:38] and said ananias rise go to the street
[32:42] called strength
[32:44] there you will find one paul
[32:47] one saul amen praise god
[32:50] i want you to go there lay your hands
[32:53] upon him
[32:54] baptize him in water in the name of
[32:56] jesus christ
[32:57] for he i will use as a light to the
[33:00] gentiles
[33:01] praise god he will bring the revelation
[33:04] he will bring the light of god's word
[33:07] to the gentile peoples of
[33:10] the world amen praise god paul
[33:14] was god's identified
[33:17] apostle and messenger to the first
[33:20] church age
[33:22] so that even peter the apostle peter
[33:27] deferred to paul in
[33:30] ii peter chapter 3 verse
[33:33] verses 15 and 16
[33:37] peter speaks of things that paul speaks
[33:40] of
[33:40] that are hard to understand
[33:44] he even had a time he was wrestling
[33:46] along with what paul was saying
[33:49] amen so you see there was no apostolic
[33:51] succession
[33:53] paul was the messenger even though he
[33:56] came
[33:56] after peter amen the younger
[34:00] as with jacob anisa the younger
[34:03] was actually god's anointed servant
[34:07] and prophet for that generation
[34:10] and paul himself said i'm one born
[34:14] out of boot time amen but he was
[34:17] vindicated that he was the first church
[34:21] age messenger
[34:22] let me say it again there is no
[34:26] such a thing as apostolic
[34:30] succession on scriptural
[34:34] ungodly unholy
[34:37] and alive from the pit of hell
[34:41] look it is not enough for oh to be a
[34:44] natural descendant or even a spiritual
[34:49] descendant of a mighty man of god
[34:53] or even of this prophet of this
[34:56] generation
[34:58] is not enough my friends to think that
[35:02] by
[35:02] parenting and just
[35:06] saying the words and quoting the quotes
[35:09] that he has
[35:10] that we can inherit his anointing
[35:14] and his authority that he had
[35:17] over the devil and in the supernatural
[35:21] dimensions of this world amen let me
[35:24] tell you friends plainly you cannot
[35:27] inherit revelation
[35:30] revelation comes by grace you cannot
[35:33] inherit discernment
[35:36] discernment comes by the supernatural
[35:40] operations of the grace of god
[35:43] you cannot inherit any of these
[35:47] gifts or callings for they are given by
[35:50] god before repentance
[35:53] you cannot inherit inspiration
[35:57] you cannot inherit conviction
[36:00] that comes from god alone
[36:04] i quote that david duplici again
[36:07] god has no grandchildren
[36:12] amen my friends i don't want to hurt
[36:16] anybody here but what
[36:19] i have said and what i'm saying
[36:23] now but the reason people
[36:27] are so tossed about
[36:30] is because the church and individuals
[36:34] uh uh together has drifted away
[36:38] from the glory of the shechema of the
[36:41] living god
[36:43] amen they've drifted away
[36:46] from the glory of the revealed word of
[36:50] god for this day and hour
[36:53] shifted away from the pure anointing and
[36:57] power that flows out of that word
[37:01] hallelujah ichabod
[37:04] is now written above the doorposts
[37:07] amen and upon the signs
[37:10] of many of these denominations
[37:15] their glory is departed
[37:18] they have a name and that name only
[37:22] speaks of their glorious past but
[37:25] this is the point their glory that
[37:28] used to be there that were in the past
[37:32] was there that glory is departed
[37:36] and they're trying to milk it they're
[37:39] trying to live off of it
[37:40] they're trying to survive off of that my
[37:43] friends
[37:44] but it's gone it's passed away
[37:47] and we're living in another day
[37:50] and in another time
[37:54] there is an ongoing struggle among
[37:57] believers
[37:58] everywhere to just live holy
[38:02] to live pure to live righteous
[38:05] to live godly and to stand for
[38:09] god's word in this day and hour and it
[38:12] is a battle
[38:13] it is a fight because this struggle goes
[38:16] on
[38:17] there's a struggle in the lives of
[38:20] of the believers of god
[38:24] for this not only holiness
[38:27] but they're struggling to hold on to
[38:30] their
[38:30] to loyalty they're struggling to hold on
[38:36] to having a sense of christian
[38:39] responsibility
[38:42] many today are thinking that
[38:45] faithfulness
[38:48] is updated that you may even think
[38:53] this type of ministry and preaching
[38:56] is out of date it's old-fashioned
[39:00] and i'm proud to say it's the all-time
[39:04] holy spirit
[39:06] and the devil won't go near it that's
[39:09] the reason people fear it
[39:11] for it's good enough for me hebrews 11
[39:16] they came with sheepskins and got skins
[39:19] that came them the monster my friends
[39:22] you would never think those would be man
[39:25] of god
[39:25] but those were the kinds of people
[39:29] god called on the scene to bring his
[39:32] word the most unlikely making the high
[39:35] places low and the law of places high
[39:39] amen praise god hallelujah amen
[39:43] yes believers
[39:46] want to claim christianity
[39:50] but have no accountability
[39:53] they take this kind of christianity
[39:57] that we are preaching today is an
[40:01] old-fashioned primitive type of
[40:04] christianity
[40:05] and it is because we what the original
[40:09] word
[40:10] the original holy spirit anointing
[40:13] the original moving of god damn
[40:17] the original revelation out of his word
[40:20] amen people today they they're in christ
[40:23] today
[40:24] and they're out tomorrow they are with
[40:27] this group today
[40:29] and oh they like it so they've gone to
[40:32] that
[40:33] group tomorrow church hopping
[40:37] like that all the time amen
[40:41] many of our young people have gone to
[40:44] church
[40:46] trying out their mother's faith
[40:49] or their father's faith but that doesn't
[40:52] work
[40:54] many have tried to live
[40:59] by being propped up by the preacher
[41:03] the cats tend to stand alone with
[41:07] god because there are like hot
[41:10] house tomato plants that's got to be
[41:13] propped up all the time and has got to
[41:16] be
[41:17] spread and protected from all kinds of
[41:20] bugs
[41:21] when the real plant is out in the wild
[41:24] there
[41:25] bearing the storms and the wind and the
[41:28] insects and everything else
[41:29] and they are rugged they are strong
[41:32] because they are god planted them there
[41:36] and when god really plants a christian a
[41:39] real believer
[41:41] they are rugged saints of god that can
[41:44] stand the very test of time
[41:48] hallelujah amen many try to live
[41:53] by the preachers convictions
[41:57] live amen by brother branham's faith
[42:02] by his visions by his convictions
[42:07] but that would work my friends you are
[42:10] facing
[42:10] a real devil that is here today
[42:15] and you can not sell your ship
[42:20] with yesterday's breeze
[42:23] take up about it my friends you've got
[42:26] to have
[42:28] your own moment of enlightenment
[42:31] your own flesh of inspiration
[42:34] god has got to give you divine
[42:38] enlightenment amen
[42:41] of revelation and heartfelt
[42:44] conviction out of his divine
[42:48] word for yourself this is the end times
[42:53] this is the evening time the sun is
[42:57] going down
[42:58] darkness is everywhere and is covering
[43:02] the land
[43:03] and neither god nor satan
[43:06] will let you get away with
[43:09] anything else than personal
[43:13] faith conviction and revelation from god
[43:18] where you are certain of who you
[43:21] are and then satan will begin to obey
[43:25] your authority
[43:28] but if you don't know who you are you
[43:31] have no revelation of who you
[43:33] are you have no seed you have no
[43:36] anchor amen no credibility in hell
[43:40] no reputation in hell the devil will not
[43:44] give you the time of day
[43:46] but when you say i come in the name of
[43:49] jesus
[43:50] you come in the character you come in
[43:53] the
[43:54] stature you come with the person of
[43:57] christ
[43:58] in you hallelujah you're not talking
[44:00] about him
[44:01] christ in you your hope of glory greater
[44:05] is he that is in you
[44:06] than he that is in the world now the
[44:09] devil starts to
[44:11] turn around break screech scream
[44:14] and demons scream and come out at the
[44:17] word of god
[44:18] the power of the holy ghost cancers are
[44:21] coughed up amen
[44:22] they go from the people amen sicknesses
[44:25] disappear
[44:26] why not because of you but because
[44:29] christ is on the scene
[44:31] the pillar of fire is here amen
[44:34] and he is able to cross the miles i
[44:37] don't care where you are
[44:40] you can be six thousand miles away from
[44:42] here
[44:44] there is no distance with god there is
[44:46] no distance in prayer
[44:48] there is no distance in the anointing if
[44:51] thou
[44:51] canst believe all things are
[44:54] possible to them that will believe the
[44:57] word of god
[44:58] accept the promise accept the word of
[45:01] god
[45:02] rise and be healed in the name of jesus
[45:04] christ
[45:05] trust him believe him amen o
[45:08] man of blind receive their sight may the
[45:12] deaf hear amen praise god
[45:15] whatever is the desire of your heart and
[45:18] i
[45:18] give it to you in the name of jesus
[45:21] christ our lord
[45:22] receive it if you can believe you'll
[45:25] have it
[45:25] then tell and testify of the goodness
[45:28] and the grace
[45:29] of almighty god hallelujah amen
[45:33] the devil is not afraid of just your
[45:36] saying jesus
[45:37] but it's the life behind the name
[45:40] that makes the demons tremble
[45:43] it's his life behind your name
[45:47] that makes the demons tremble may god
[45:51] live behind your skin oh my god
[45:55] may the same god that was
[45:58] living back on the badger skin goat skin
[46:01] sheepskin
[46:02] that were hanging in the veil of the
[46:05] temple
[46:05] may god use you as his veil for this
[46:09] hour
[46:09] and live behind your skin and
[46:12] manifest himself and there my friends is
[46:16] real christianity
[46:17] not you trying to be a christian or
[46:19] trying to live right
[46:21] or trying to be good but the life of
[46:24] god in me the life of god in you
[46:28] the life of christ living through you
[46:31] and manifesting and projecting his own
[46:35] self
[46:36] through you that is god
[46:39] interpreting his own life and his own
[46:43] word
[46:44] and making himself known to this
[46:47] generation that he is the same yesterday
[46:51] today and forever praise god hallelujah

[48:03] come to grips

[48:09] luke 17 30 revelation
[48:13] 10 1 to 7
[48:16] hallelujah we are my friends the
[48:20] children of the living god

[48:31] the
[48:31] end of the world you've still got to
[48:33] have the tribulation you've got to have
[48:35] israel
[48:36] come to power you've got to have the two
[48:38] witnesses come back
[48:40] there's many other events
[48:43] that must take place eschatologically
[48:48] there are things that must come to pass
[48:51] i'm speaking about the church i'm
[48:54] telling you we are not the pepsi
[48:56] generation
[48:57] we are not the cult generation we are
[49:00] not the
[49:00] ex-generation we are the joshua
[49:03] generation
[49:04] we are the rapture generation oh praise
[49:08] god forevermore
[49:09] this is the hour and the day in which we
[49:12] are living here hallelujah
[49:14] praise god so those men
[49:18] made their claims rebuked the devil
[49:22] and the devil sprang on them and tore
[49:25] their clothing
[49:26] and kicked them out of the house in
[49:29] which
[49:30] they were yes jesus i know paul i know
[49:33] but
[49:34] i identify yourself oh you can't
[49:36] identify yourself then i'm going to
[49:38] throw you out
[49:39] of here amen my friend
[49:42] if the devil would get a chance to look
[49:45] into your heart
[49:47] amen will he be able to see jesus there
[49:51] will he be able to recognize
[49:56] that you are you are in dwelt
[49:59] you are filled you're anointed with the
[50:02] person
[50:03] in the presence of jesus christ himself
[50:07] and that when you speak you can
[50:10] not be denied for it is christ in you
[50:14] the hope of glory
[50:15] amen glory to god hallelujah
[50:18] they stood dog dumb they could not
[50:22] give an answer they were mad
[50:26] a laugh in stock in front of the public
[50:31] there were religious church members
[50:35] their father was a chief priest and yet
[50:39] the devil made a laughing stock out of
[50:42] them we got to be careful in our day
[50:44] and in our time regardless of who we
[50:47] are today amen but friends
[50:51] i want to thank god in the midst of the
[50:54] confusion
[50:56] oh there is a real true church of god
[51:00] and there are few in number
[51:04] but take god that church is
[51:08] marching to the drum beats
[51:11] of the word of god i don't know
[51:16] what you hear but do you hear what i
[51:18] hear
[51:19] oh praise god we're marching to the
[51:22] rhythm
[51:23] of god's holy word brother branham some
[51:27] time ago
[51:29] saw the church of god as a
[51:32] bunch of young women well dressed holy
[51:36] clean
[51:37] righteous marching to the sound of
[51:40] music amen and when they march with the
[51:44] sound of music
[51:45] like that the first group was so
[51:49] dressed they were so half naked dressed
[51:53] there my friends sex exposure clothing
[51:56] on
[51:56] and they marched to the top of the hill
[51:59] and when they
[52:00] got to the to the very cliff they fell
[52:04] right down into the canyon
[52:07] the gulf that was below
[52:10] he began to cry he said lord
[52:14] all these years of preaching and is this
[52:18] what the church world is
[52:20] is this what i have produced
[52:23] and while he was crying he heard
[52:26] music coming again
[52:30] oh and when he looked it was another
[52:34] group of young women but these were
[52:37] properly dressed
[52:39] modestly dressed marching to the sound
[52:42] of the music that they were marching
[52:45] though oh thank god
[52:47] god still has a a triumphant church
[52:51] marching to the sound of the gospel and
[52:53] the power of the word of god
[52:55] hallelujah and he watched them march to
[52:58] the
[52:59] very cliff of the hill and then instead
[53:02] of going down
[53:03] this set march right on up
[53:07] into the skies i'm believing it's the
[53:10] true believers of this generation that
[53:13] will be raptured out of here by the
[53:16] grace

[53:20] blessed be the name of the lord glory to
[53:24] his marvelous

[53:41] testimony and the name of the lord jesus
[53:44] christ hallelujah
[53:46] amen praise god we live in an age

[54:55] are
[54:55] there amen we've got to be
[54:59] careful that like eve we are not
[55:02] charmed by satan dressed up

[55:13] promised
