[41:57] [Applause]
[42:01] very odd that God doesn't change his
[42:05] mind about this word somebody twisting
[42:08] things around and started teaching the

[42:13] the Father the Son and then the Holy
[42:17] Spirit and they understand that it was
[42:21] the one God amen who didn't down the
[42:26] tree to the body herself in the womb of
[42:29] Mary and when that pollen import the
