[0:00] [Music]
[0:15] good evening
[0:17] it's wonderful to be here again with you
[0:21] on this marvelous wednesday evening
[0:26] in this glorious marvelous
[0:30] continuing series
[0:33] of the seven church ages
[0:37] of course tonight
[0:39] our topic is
[0:42] come walk with me
[0:44] in white
[0:46] come walk with me
[0:49] in white
[0:51] and our
[0:53] scripture is found in revelation chapter
[0:57] 3
[0:59] reading
[1:00] verse 4
[1:04] thou hast
[1:05] a few names
[1:07] even in sardis
[1:10] which have not defiled their garments
[1:15] and they shall walk with me in white
[1:21] for they are worthy
[1:24] amen to him
[1:27] that overcome it
[1:28] the same shall be clothed
[1:31] in white raiment
[1:34] god bless his wonderful
[1:36] word to our hearts
[1:39] and our lives
[1:41] as we come together here tonight
[1:45] of course
[1:48] i read the scripture
[1:50] once more just for a bit of emphasis
[1:56] thou hast
[1:58] a few names
[2:02] then it uses this word
[2:04] even in
[2:06] sardis god is saying
[2:11] think of it
[2:12] even in sardis
[2:16] even
[2:17] in sodom
[2:20] even in the midst of babylon
[2:23] thou hast a few names
[2:27] in the midst of the chaos the confusion
[2:30] the unfulfillment the unfaithfulness
[2:34] of this age of sardis
[2:37] god is saying with emphasis
[2:41] even in sardis
[2:44] even with all satan's wiles and tricks
[2:48] and traps and trials
[2:51] even with satan's temptations
[2:55] and his terrible
[2:57] uh
[2:58] strategies that he used
[3:01] even in sardis
[3:04] thou hast a few names
[3:08] amen
[3:10] a few names
[3:12] that have not defiled their garments
[3:16] and they shall walk with me
[3:20] in white
[3:22] for they
[3:24] are
[3:24] worthy
[3:27] of course
[3:28] the word names
[3:31] actually refers to people
[3:35] as we can see in
[3:38] the book of acts
[3:40] chapter 1 verse 15
[3:44] concerning those that were in the upper
[3:47] room
[3:48] the bible says
[3:50] the number of names together
[3:54] were about a hundred
[3:57] and twenty
[3:59] so names refer to people
[4:03] so thou has the few people
[4:06] in that age in that church
[4:09] that will walk with me
[4:12] in
[4:12] white now of course
[4:15] signifying only people
[4:18] that
[4:19] thought goes a little further than that
[4:23] and it brings out the truth
[4:26] that
[4:27] this church system
[4:30] that was forming
[4:32] itself
[4:34] coming up
[4:35] in its sprouting time
[4:38] the springtime of growth
[4:41] the reformation
[4:44] of the entire system
[4:47] and there
[4:49] god
[4:50] is wanting us to see that
[4:54] there are two vines
[4:58] this trail of the serpent
[5:02] this
[5:03] continuing
[5:05] moving of the mystery of iniquity
[5:09] it continues from
[5:12] the garden of eden
[5:14] and it travels
[5:16] down the streams of time
[5:19] until
[5:20] the that day and to this day that we are
[5:24] living in
[5:26] god is saying there are two vines
[5:30] there are two trees
[5:33] there are
[5:34] twin spirits
[5:36] operating within
[5:39] the
[5:40] church body
[5:43] true and false
[5:46] but thanks be to god
[5:49] though he could have separated them
[5:53] though god could have separated cain and
[5:55] abel
[5:57] though of god could have separated jacob
[6:00] and esau
[6:02] though god could have separated jenny's
[6:04] and jamborees away from moses and so on
[6:09] through the bible
[6:11] this mystery of evil
[6:15] riding
[6:16] side by side or walking side by side
[6:21] with the good
[6:23] is in the scriptures
[6:26] from genesis to revelation
[6:30] judas
[6:32] with jesus
[6:34] right on through the book of acts
[6:38] right from among yourselves
[6:41] men right right will rise up
[6:44] who are what
[6:46] ravening wolves
[6:48] right in your midst
[6:51] and god is saying
[6:54] that this was like that
[6:57] in this age
[6:59] of sardis
[7:01] yet in his great purpose
[7:04] he calls them the church
[7:07] he calls
[7:08] both groups
[7:10] lumped together
[7:12] as one
[7:13] he calls them
[7:15] the church
[7:17] now
[7:18] he rebukes the age
[7:22] and
[7:24] on to the church
[7:27] which is in sardis
[7:30] i know
[7:32] thy works
[7:35] that you are dead
[7:38] and your works are unfulfilled
[7:42] not completed
[7:45] and then god goes on and says
[7:48] thou that's the church which is in
[7:50] sardis
[7:52] just has a few people
[7:54] amen
[7:56] hallelujah that are living right walking
[8:00] right
[8:02] and not wrong hallelujah
[8:05] like the majority
[8:08] of the rest of them are doing
[8:11] god is
[8:12] speaking to the age
[8:14] of sardis
[8:16] these few
[8:19] are they that walk
[8:21] in clean garments
[8:25] that are worthy of him
[8:27] oh praise god
[8:29] may god help us to live our lives
[8:33] and walk our christian walk
[8:36] with this same
[8:38] attitude with the same burning desire
[8:43] that we should
[8:45] walk worthy of our calling
[8:48] of the lord
[8:50] as
[8:51] we ask the question is your life
[8:56] worthy of the gospel
[8:58] is your life
[9:01] worthy of the truth
[9:03] that we speak
[9:05] that we teach that we witness
[9:09] is does our life
[9:11] match up with our
[9:13] testimony that we give
[9:16] may the great holy spirit
[9:20] help us that we walk
[9:22] with our lives worthy of the gospel
[9:27] now these people that were the true
[9:29] saints
[9:31] the elected of god in that time
[9:35] were walking in such a way
[9:38] that their lives
[9:40] were all pleasing to god
[9:44] and that is why god
[9:47] points them out
[9:48] singles them out
[9:51] lets them know that he has his eyes upon
[9:54] them
[9:54] thou hast a few names
[9:58] hallelujah
[9:59] and my eyes are upon them
[10:02] i've seen them
[10:04] and they are pleasing
[10:06] to me said the lord
[10:10] their garments were clean
[10:12] because they are walking
[10:15] in the light
[10:16] of the revealed word
[10:19] of the living god hallelujah
[10:22] now for us to understand
[10:25] what is being said here
[10:28] they will walk the world with me in
[10:32] white
[10:34] now in those days
[10:37] as you know
[10:38] the people wore
[10:40] uh
[10:41] long eastern garments
[10:45] and many times those garments
[10:48] will sweep along
[10:51] the ground
[10:52] now remember back then they had no
[10:55] pitched roads
[10:56] beautiful highways
[10:58] lovely lanes they had no street sweepers
[11:03] machine
[11:04] to pass by
[11:05] and to clean the streets
[11:08] and have them beautifully clean by
[11:10] morning
[11:12] they did not have that
[11:14] instead what they had
[11:17] were roads in which there were ruts
[11:20] in which camels walked
[11:24] in which donkeys walked
[11:28] dogs
[11:30] other animals
[11:32] and as they walked
[11:34] their refuse would also be in the
[11:37] streets
[11:39] so one had to walk carefully
[11:44] watching how they walked
[11:47] where they walk
[11:49] and what they were doing one had to pay
[11:52] attention
[11:53] so
[11:54] god is saying here in the word
[11:58] they shall walk with me
[12:01] in white
[12:02] because what
[12:04] they have not defiled their garments
[12:08] their garments are not spotted
[12:11] their garments are without blemish
[12:15] and so therefore he says they shall walk
[12:19] with me
[12:21] remember as i just referred one has to
[12:24] be very careful
[12:27] of how you're walking
[12:29] back then
[12:31] lest
[12:32] you were to step into something
[12:35] undesirable
[12:37] in our modern times you may
[12:40] step into a uh an undesirable situation
[12:45] condition
[12:46] or position
[12:48] so one had had to be careful then where
[12:52] they walked
[12:53] some streets were
[12:56] worse than others
[12:58] and one had to choose their path
[13:01] where they were walking
[13:03] as much as we have to choose our path of
[13:07] life
[13:08] what will my life be
[13:11] what will my future hold
[13:15] in what direction am i headed
[13:18] one has to be careful watchful
[13:22] and aware of how they're walking
[13:26] and where they're walking
[13:29] and also
[13:32] one has to be careful
[13:34] of whom you are walking with
[13:37] you must be careful
[13:40] that you're not with someone
[13:42] that will distract you
[13:45] that will delay you
[13:47] one that will uh have you walking into a
[13:52] mess
[13:53] with them
[13:55] so he is saying
[13:57] they shall walk with me because they are
[14:00] careful they're watchful they're aware
[14:04] they know what is happening
[14:07] and even in the midst of the
[14:11] the chaos the unfulfillment
[14:15] the
[14:16] systematic evil
[14:18] that pervades sardis
[14:21] god is saying there are a few
[14:25] even insiders
[14:27] that will walk and is walking the world
[14:31] with me in white
[14:33] and that same one invites you tonight
[14:38] come walk with me in this world in white
[14:43] that he might lead you and guide you
[14:46] that he might surround you and keep you
[14:49] in holiness and his righteousness that
[14:52] you may walk through the world without
[14:55] blemish and without blame
[14:58] oh praise be to god hallelujah amen
[15:03] those wands my friends
[15:06] did not walk in a place
[15:09] where their garments will pick up
[15:12] defilement
[15:14] where their garments will pick up dust
[15:17] and dirt
[15:18] dirt
[15:20] and the things that would be scattered
[15:23] within the street amen
[15:27] because they were watching
[15:29] how they walked
[15:31] where they walk
[15:33] and with whom
[15:34] they were walked so god is saying they
[15:38] they're not corrupted by the world
[15:42] they have tru they have tried to keep
[15:45] out
[15:46] of the systems
[15:48] the temptations the evil
[15:50] the corruption and the chaos that which
[15:54] is within the world its system and its
[15:57] civilization
[15:59] and therefore
[16:01] they will walk the world with me in
[16:05] white and you are invited to walk with
[16:08] him i am invited to walk this world with
[16:13] him in white of course
[16:16] white he is speaking of walking with him
[16:20] in righteousness
[16:22] walking with him in holiness
[16:24] let us go on as we look into the word
[16:28] hallelujah amen friends you will say
[16:31] well how could they do
[16:34] this in such a wicked and evil
[16:39] age
[16:40] how could daniel
[16:44] do that
[16:45] how could he live godly in babylon
[16:49] how is it possible
[16:51] that he could do that
[16:54] how could they walk the world
[16:57] walk through the age of sardis
[17:00] and come out on the other side in white
[17:05] with their garments clean
[17:07] unspotted praise god
[17:10] how could those three boys
[17:14] down in babylon with daniel
[17:18] how could they
[17:20] go into the fires of babylon even walk
[17:24] through the fire
[17:26] that was set for them
[17:28] and come out of the fiery furnace and
[17:32] the bible records that there was not
[17:36] even the smell of smoke upon their
[17:39] garments may god help us
[17:43] in our walk
[17:46] in our way of living
[17:49] that the reality of this gospel will
[17:51] strike our soul
[17:54] and it will not just be a something of
[17:57] tradition
[17:59] are just trying to be religious
[18:02] but being his life in us keeps us
[18:07] and my friends moves us to the point
[18:11] where we want to walk through this
[18:14] entire world
[18:16] in white
[18:17] in cleanliness
[18:20] amen unspotted from the world and the
[18:24] things of the world i ask the question
[18:28] how could they do it
[18:30] they do it
[18:32] and you and i
[18:34] can
[18:35] must and will do it
[18:37] by walking with and in the spirit of
[18:41] almighty god
[18:42] walking with the holy spirit
[18:45] walking in the holy spirit being guided
[18:49] by the holy spirit oh every step we take
[18:53] my friends ought to be
[18:56] by the leadership of the holy spirit of
[19:00] whom the bible tells us the sons and
[19:03] daughters of god are led by the spirit
[19:06] of god so must we today be led by god's
[19:12] holy spirit through this earth and the
[19:16] world that we are living in hallelujah
[19:19] they were holy
[19:22] they were blameless
[19:25] walking before him praise god
[19:29] and by doing that
[19:31] they were fulfilling their life's
[19:34] purpose
[19:35] ephesians 1 4
[19:37] says that that is the purpose of god for
[19:40] us
[19:41] that we should be holy
[19:43] and without blame
[19:45] before him
[19:47] o praise god amen
[19:51] now the scripture tells us friends
[19:54] that the elect of god
[19:57] that was within
[20:01] the body or framework of the
[20:05] sardis church
[20:07] was
[20:08] just a few people
[20:10] just a few names
[20:13] in the massive majority
[20:16] of that day
[20:17] there were only a few names
[20:21] jesus
[20:22] referring to his time
[20:25] and referring to our day in which we're
[20:28] living in
[20:29] where there are millions upon millions
[20:32] claiming to be true sons and daughters
[20:35] of god
[20:36] claiming to be real christians
[20:39] and yet he says fear not little flock
[20:43] little flock
[20:45] it is my father's what pleasure to give
[20:48] you the kingdom
[20:50] jesus is saying again
[20:53] as we come to the end of time
[20:57] the end of the church ages
[21:00] few there be that will walk the world
[21:04] with him in white
[21:07] not that there will be few in the church
[21:10] there'll be many in the church there'll
[21:12] be many religious
[21:14] many christians
[21:16] yes
[21:17] but there are just a few names
[21:21] that will walk the world come walk with
[21:24] me through this world of white is the
[21:27] cry of the holy spirit come walk with me
[21:30] in the midst of the madness mayhem chaos
[21:34] that we are living in come walk with me
[21:39] believe the word of god and allow the
[21:43] word to influence your life change your
[21:47] actions and attitudes and i will lead
[21:50] you and guide you so that you may walk
[21:53] through this world
[21:55] in white
[21:56] hallelujah
[21:58] now as we can see
[22:01] the teaching
[22:03] of this age
[22:05] was very chaotic
[22:09] it was not
[22:10] enough so that the
[22:13] age
[22:14] was unfulfilled
[22:17] it did not come up
[22:20] to its full
[22:21] expectations
[22:24] it was split
[22:27] into scores of ways
[22:31] and god rebuked the entire thing
[22:36] rebuked them in its entirety
[22:39] for the age was weak
[22:42] it was also sickly
[22:46] and not only was it weak and sickly
[22:49] what it was sick
[22:51] and
[22:52] nigh unto death
[22:54] oh
[22:55] think of it
[22:57] a man laying in a
[22:59] sick bed
[23:01] nigh unto death
[23:04] and usually he's gasping for fresh air
[23:08] he's gasping for some air that he might
[23:12] live
[23:13] and so god is using
[23:16] this reference
[23:18] that we might recognize
[23:21] the seriousness and the danger of this
[23:24] age of sardis
[23:26] an age gasping for breath
[23:30] an age br gasping for the breath of the
[23:34] holy spirit
[23:37] gasping for a fresh move of god
[23:41] a revival of the holy spirit that will
[23:45] re-energize
[23:46] and quicken the age back to the word
[23:50] back to christ back to the original
[23:53] apostolic faith as found within
[23:57] the bible
[23:59] now this was not a glorious age
[24:02] as many
[24:04] uh protestant historians
[24:07] have tried to
[24:09] make it out to be
[24:12] my friends
[24:14] spiritually as i said this age was upon
[24:17] its deathbed
[24:20] and it was crying out
[24:22] for god to sin and outpouring of the
[24:26] holy spirit
[24:27] to be able to lift it to higher ground
[24:32] if we're to take a look at the age
[24:35] of sardis
[24:38] and envision it as a great tree
[24:42] then we will see it as a
[24:44] tree that was sorely conquered
[24:50] a tree
[24:52] that was blighted
[24:54] by various worms and bugs
[24:58] eating at its roots branches and
[25:00] foundations
[25:02] yes
[25:04] a tree
[25:06] denuded
[25:08] even of the of its leaves which
[25:10] represents praise
[25:13] worship
[25:14] adoration
[25:16] honor respects and glory to god
[25:20] the tree
[25:21] of sardis
[25:23] was denuded of its
[25:25] leaves
[25:27] yes sir and
[25:29] barren a fruit
[25:31] they could not bear sweet precious fruit
[25:36] for the glory of god
[25:38] in the environment in which they were
[25:42] living
[25:44] it was a strain
[25:46] it was a struggle
[25:48] it was a continuous intense pressure
[25:51] upon them
[25:53] and they
[25:54] just could not produce the fruit
[25:58] for his coming glory that he so desires
[26:03] in them
[26:04] and even if
[26:07] they did show
[26:09] as if they had some fruit
[26:12] usually the fruit was deformed
[26:15] and wormy
[26:17] eaten by worms
[26:20] doctrines of men teachings of man
[26:23] insertions of men
[26:25] within the framework of the word of god
[26:29] and the church of the living god
[26:32] oh
[26:33] and not only that
[26:34] the fruit from off that tree of sardis
[26:37] was dropping fast
[26:40] it was just dropping off of the tree
[26:43] and falling to the ground but look a
[26:47] little closer
[26:48] look to that tree
[26:51] of sardis
[26:53] god said but thou hast a few names
[26:57] amen hallelujah
[26:59] that are worthy and will walk the world
[27:02] with me
[27:04] if you look to the top of the tree
[27:07] as we may look to the top of the pyramid
[27:10] in our age and time
[27:13] there you may see
[27:15] a few fruits
[27:17] hidden beneath the leaves but exposed to
[27:21] the sun
[27:22] at the highest point
[27:24] being ripened with the sweetness and the
[27:28] savor
[27:29] that comes from the heat of the sun
[27:33] and so will you and i
[27:36] be ripened through the revelation
[27:40] of the sunlight
[27:42] of the holy spirit
[27:44] coming forth from the word of god amen
[27:48] though the tree be blighted deformed
[27:51] wormy and everything else at the top of
