[51:51] were if it were never lost
[51:54] a man in that capacity and we gotta

[54:19] and over again amen hallelujah
[54:23] and I want to enter Jackie a little bit
[54:26] you know Noah you ever hear about Noah
[54:29] were you if you were any days
[54:34] what are you preaching they're coming a
[54:37] flood
[54:38] 10 years pass Noah
[54:42] was your message but often knowing
[54:44] change your message is the same thing
[54:46] you're preaching every day
[54:49] to destroy 20 years past 50 years next
[54:53] thing does he knows and building this
[54:56] big boot
[54:57] amen

[55:04] gone insane
[55:08] you change this
[55:11] man we're here in this thing so long we
[55:15] see if they don't already if they knew
[55:17] that the same God know our preaching
[55:19] when you gotta create and bring the
[55:21] amount of water that bring that flood
[55:23] opted that boat where it was up and he
[55:25] mounted amen hallelujah so don't let
[55:28] this be too common to you or you mean
[55:31] that I could say this same thing again I
[55:33] hear the surveillance
[55:35] why you talk something deep
[55:47] see God is a God as simple we as human
[55:51] beings need to be reminded time and time
[55:53] again to keep our Focus
[55:55] don't be shifted you know keep our Focus
[55:58] let our sight
[56:00] backside and our front side be in line
[56:03] Amen Let the revelation of the word
[56:08] be you know your Target in your Insight
[56:11] that you can you know look straight
[56:13] ahead and look to the promises of God
[56:16] that he has given to you
[56:19] I mean you see God
[56:22] who is a prophet
[56:24] see God will take a prophet right
[56:28] and show him a panoramic view of
[56:31] everything
[56:33] so you gotta tell you
[56:35] what happened
[56:37] what is happening presently in your life
[56:40] and he's going to tell you what's in the
[56:42] future
[56:44] so if you had a sickness what's
[56:46] something that caused us and he could
[56:48] have gone and said okay that causes
[56:49] sickness you're suffering right now from
[56:52] it by a senior heel you already see the
[56:54] future
[56:55] amen and that's God man so when God
[56:59] spoke to Daniel they had a paneric view
[57:03] of everything and that's why they could
[57:05] have gone and written these things down
[57:07] amen and When God Says something it does
[57:11] not feel it must come to pass
[57:14] so when you read any Book of Revelation
[57:16] all these things amen
[57:18] amen hallelujah
[57:20] those things must come to pass
[57:25] Hallelujah because that's what God
[57:28] showed and revealed it unto his servants
[57:31] the prophets amen that they could have
[57:34] seen into the future they could have
[57:36] seen the solution the Saudi problem and
[57:39] they're seeing the solution to one time
[57:41] write it or this is going to happen that
[57:43] is going to happen this is going to
[57:45] happen amen hallelujah and God says you
[57:48] are an overcomer
[57:50] amen do you believe that
[57:53] so it's in your future you see that you
[57:56] already overcome so don't let Satan beat
[57:59] you and put you down
[58:00] amen hallelujah that you are an
[58:03] overcomer so don't matter what problems
[58:07] or tests or examination whatever he
[58:11] challenges that Satan placed before you
[58:14] you already overcame them
[58:18] don't you believe that tonight
[58:20] do you believe that tonight

[58:25] honor and Glory

[59:11] could be born in a certain time
[59:13] among a certain race amongst certain
[59:16] people in which country what language

[1:00:46] knows the end from the beginning he
[1:00:49] isn't willing that any Shall Perish
[1:00:51] that's not his desire but being God he
[1:00:55] had to know who would and who would not
