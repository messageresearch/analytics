[36:32] so let's go to the word of God this
[36:35] morning
[36:38] um you can go to the first slide there
[36:41] this morning um the Lord has led me this
[36:43] week to uh to speak on the
[36:46] church and
[36:50] Israel and uh you know I was inspired
[36:53] when I was doing a little bit of
[36:54] research about Israel being God's time
[36:57] piece I came across this quote here
[37:00] where brother Bram is speaking in um in
[37:04] recognizing your day in its message and
[37:06] I found it interesting but it struck me
[37:08] he says now my my subject this morning
[37:11] is recognizing your day and its
[37:15] message we see from last Sunday's lesson
[37:18] as we taught the Feast of the
[37:20] trumpets and I want to call to your
[37:23] attention now the time he says time of
[37:27] Israel
[37:28] In God's Time piece and that's where I
[37:31] drew my title from um I was inspired by
[37:35] that he goes on and he says now he says
[37:38] we are dealing today upon a Sunday
[37:39] school lesson that I want you to realize
[37:42] and recognize the time that we're
[37:46] living He says we're just about to run
[37:49] out as you see and then by this you
[37:54] should know the very hour and time and
[37:58] sign and message that you are to
[38:02] receive now as we started last Sunday we
[38:05] had been speaking on going to preach on
[38:09] the trumpets the last seven trumpets of
[38:12] the Bible and me in myself I thought
[38:16] they would Break Forth just like the
[38:18] seals but I've noticed on each one of
[38:21] these openings there has been a
[38:24] tremendous thing happening happening he
[38:27] and he was talking about how when you
[38:29] know when when the seals were open how
[38:31] the Holy Spirit was revealing everything
[38:34] that was under each one of those seals
[38:37] and um he realized that that something
[38:40] tremendous was
[38:42] happening and as we preached the seven
[38:44] Church ages and they were so perfectly
[38:47] until the Holy Spirit himself come down
[38:50] Among Us and Vindicated it and put it
[38:53] upon the papers and throwed it across
[38:56] the nation and and showed it in the moon
[38:59] in the heavens and proved it to us weeks
[39:02] and months before it happened that's
[39:06] just the way it would be perfectly and
[39:10] so notice here and and what you know I
[39:13] want to draw your attention to is how
[39:15] the Holy Spirit had shown him uh these
[39:19] things and what was happening in the
[39:22] midst of while he was ministering these
[39:24] trumpets and all around recog izing your
[39:28] day all around Israel as God's time
[39:33] piece and so he he continues here and he
[39:36] says here as the Holy Spirit was writing
[39:38] it here in the Tabernacle he made it
[39:40] known here on in the time he made it
[39:44] known on the moon and the sun he made it
[39:48] known and in the position of the Nations
[39:50] at this time and I want I want you to
[39:54] you know pay attention here pay
[39:56] attention and and take this and apply it
[39:59] to the day and the hour that we're
[40:01] living in and what he's saying here to
[40:03] the Nations at this time he made it
[40:05] known as the hierarchy of Rome left and
[40:09] went back to Palestine supposedly had
[40:13] been the first pope back since they
[40:16] claimed Peter being the pope which we
[40:19] know he wasn't now it was so tremendous
[40:24] that we see before the Seven Seals that
[40:27] that hid all the Mysteries me not
[40:29] knowing what I was drawing on the board
[40:32] for the church ages I never God knows
[40:36] just by Vision I draw it not knowing
[40:39] that God a year and six months later was
[40:43] going to vindicate it in the skies by
[40:45] the moon and slip it across the national
[40:48] papers I didn't know that I didn't know
[40:52] there would be a mysterious blackout in
[40:54] the moon to represent this Leo Dean
[40:59] age and so you know all these thoughts
[41:03] started to go through my mind of you
[41:06] know what we've experienced this year
[41:07] and what took place you know um when we
[41:11] had the uh the lunar eclipse the solar
[41:14] eclipse amen um just several months ago
[41:18] and how the Holy Spirit was revealing
[41:20] you know how he shows signs in the
[41:22] heavens before he reflects and manifests
[41:26] and brings to pass things upon the Earth
[41:30] and so this all just you know was
[41:33] breaking open this week and Saints we'll
[41:38] see where it's going to take us all I
[41:41] can say is that you know the bride is is
[41:44] moving in
[41:47] Prophecy the church is moving in
[41:51] Prophecy she is fulfilling prophecy in
[41:55] this day and in this hour and when when
[41:57] we look at what's going on amongst the
[42:00] Nations and in the world we see prophecy
[42:05] being
[42:06] fulfilled but you know a lot of people
[42:09] like we've heard many times they look
[42:11] back to see what the Lord did they're
[42:15] looking forward to see what the Lord is
[42:17] going to do but fail to recognize and
[42:21] see what it what it is that he is doing
[42:25] right now and and that's what we're
[42:28] excited about the Church of this hour
[42:32] recognizes by Perfect faith that the
[42:36] spirit of God is in their midst amen is
[42:40] in the midst of the church speaking lip
[42:44] to ear through the foolishness of
[42:47] preaching by a five-fold Ministry in
[42:50] this day and in this hour and that we
[42:52] can receive and and hear uh instruction
[42:56] Direct directly from the Lord amen
[43:00] directly from God what he's doing
[43:04] now are you
[43:06] excited I'm excited about what the Lord
[43:08] is doing now amen let's all stand and
[43:12] we'll go to our scripture so that's how
[43:16] um we're where we're at right now our
[43:21] scripture comes from Daniel CH
[43:25] 12 verses 9 to
[43:29] 12 and he said go thy Way Daniel for the
[43:32] words are closed up and sealed till the
[43:35] time of the end many shall be purified
[43:39] and made white and tried but the wicked
[43:42] shall do wickedly now I want you to see
[43:45] what's what you know what he's saying
[43:47] here what you know things just pop out
[43:49] when when I'm reading the scripture and
[43:51] he says that many shall be purified and
[43:54] made white and tried I believe that
[43:57] that's been going
[43:59] on this is what we've been
[44:02] experiencing the church is being
[44:05] purified being uh you know our purging
[44:08] and our purification happens
[44:11] now that's why the church does not go
[44:14] into the Great Tribulation amen the
[44:17] church goes up in a Rapture amen so he
[44:21] says here but the wicked shall do
[44:23] wickedly in other words the wicked and
[44:27] all those spirits and powers and
[44:29] principalities and dominions that are
[44:32] doing what they're doing in the earth
[44:34] and the wickedness and the
[44:36] evil that's going on is just going to go
[44:39] on that's right as it is yes but we are
[44:43] we are uh been uh uh been given the eyes
[44:47] to see and to recognize and the ears to
[44:50] hear what it is that the Lord is
[44:53] revealing to us in the midst of all of
[44:56] this evil and none of the wicked shall
[44:59] understand they're not going to know
[45:01] what they're
[45:02] doing because they are fulfilling
[45:06] scripture they are fulfilling the word
[45:08] of God Amen but the wise shall
[45:13] understand we're going to be given the
[45:15] ability and the spirit of Revelation to
[45:19] understand and to know the mysteries of
[45:21] the kingdom of
[45:23] God and from the time that the daily
[45:27] sacrifice shall be taken away and the
[45:29] Abomination that maketh desolate set up
[45:32] there shall be a th
[45:35] 290 days blessed is he that waiteth and
[45:40] cometh to the
[45:42] 1,3
[45:44] 530
[45:46] days the Lord add His blessings to the
[45:49] word thank you Father we thank you so
[45:51] much we ask that your spirit of faith
[45:54] and revelation will stir and move in the
[45:59] heart of the speaker and in the hearts
[46:02] of the hearers Lord speak to us this
[46:05] morning make clear what it is that you
[46:08] would want us to know we pray in Jesus
[46:11] name amen God bless you Saints you may
[46:13] be
[46:15] seated you know when you look uh um it
[46:18] it talks about that when the the you
[46:21] know the the time of the Abomination
[46:24] when that does come that it'll be a
[46:26] about 3 and 1/2 years after that that um
[46:31] you know that it'll be three and a/2
[46:32] years of the Great Tribulation that'll
[46:34] be ushered in and it'll be at that time
[46:37] that we will have left this Earth before
[46:41] that happens we will have left this
[46:44] earth and the world goes into three and
[46:46] a half years of Great Tribulation and
[46:49] God deals directly with Israel amen and
[46:54] then Israel receives their Awakening
[46:58] now the next scripture I'll just read it
[47:00] for you 2 Corinthians 3:
[47:03] 12-18 it says seeing then that we have
[47:06] such hope we use great plainness of
[47:12] speech and our hope is Christ if you go
[47:15] back and you read you know 2 Corinthians
[47:18] chapter 3 he's talking about the great
[47:20] hope that that's been revealed to us
[47:23] which is Jesus
[47:24] Christ but he says and God is Moses
[47:28] which put a veil over his face that the
[47:30] children of Israel could not steadfastly
[47:34] look to the end of that which is
[47:36] abolished they could not see what was
[47:40] coming they could not because God
[47:42] blinded them they were blinded to the
[47:46] Messiah amen so they couldn't see what
[47:50] it is that you and I are seeing in
[47:53] Christ but their minds were blinded for
[47:56] until so this day remaineth the same
[47:58] Veil untaken away in the reading of the
[48:02] Old Testament which Veil is now done
[48:05] away in Christen see our our our our
[48:10] blindness was lifted when Christ came
[48:16] and died for our sins went to the cross
[48:20] and brought his Spirit back upon us so
[48:23] that we could be awakened to know who we
[48:26] are amen so our blindness was lifted
[48:30] 2,000 years ago the Gentile church
[48:33] because Israel was blinded so that God
[48:36] could take a people for his name and
[48:39] that's why we've received the name of
[48:42] Jesus Christ because we are the wife of
[48:45] the groom Jesus Christ amen praise God
[48:50] but even unto this day when Moses is
[48:52] read the veil is upon their heart
[48:55] they're still blind
[48:57] they're still blind to recognize their
[48:59] Messiah but they're not going to be
[49:02] blind for long and we can see that that
[49:06] this blindness is going to be lifting if
[49:09] not already starting to just you know
[49:12] show signs of lifting based on the faith
[49:16] that they're displaying nevertheless
[49:19] when it shall turn to the Lord the veil
[49:21] shall be taken away when God decides to
[49:25] turn it to them
[49:27] when he decides that the Holy Spirit his
[49:30] his spirit is going to uh turn to the
[49:34] nation of Israel there will be an
[49:37] unblinding take place now the Lord is
[49:42] that
[49:43] Spirit without the Holy
[49:46] Ghost there is no
[49:49] Awakening because without the word there
[49:52] is no Awakening without the Lord there
[49:55] is no Awakening
[49:57] without the father there is no
[50:00] understanding there is no Awakening we
[50:02] know that they all
[50:04] represent Christ the word amen and so
[50:10] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[50:12] Liberty but we all with face open face
[50:16] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[50:19] Lord are changed into the same image
[50:22] from glory to glory even as by the
[50:27] spirit of the Lord aren't you glad that
[50:30] the holy spirit is speaking to us aren't
[50:33] you glad that he's lifted the veil from
[50:35] you and that now when the word of God is
[50:38] preached and you hear the word it it
[50:40] just makes sense it just stirs your
[50:42] heart it just it allows you to read the
[50:45] word of God and and the understanding
[50:47] just just comes from the word it just it
[50:50] just it becomes plain and simple to you
[50:53] aren't you grateful for that amen what a
[50:56] wonderful ful Revelation and time for
[50:59] the for the True Church of Jesus Christ
[51:03] and so when we look at the scriptures
[51:06] that we've read and we we look at from
[51:10] Genesis to
[51:11] revelation we should be able to see
[51:14] Jesus Christ from Genesis to
[51:17] Revelation when when when he's talking
[51:20] about Israel and he's talking about the
[51:23] Jews we should be able to see ourselves
[51:27] everything is
[51:29] prophetically uh in the
[51:32] scripture and when you hear Pro uh you
[51:35] know prophecy of Israel you should see
[51:38] where it applies to you amen you should
[51:41] see how it applies to the day and the
[51:44] hour that you're living in you should
[51:46] see how it applies to the Nations that
[51:48] are now you know uh in public View and
[51:52] what's happening globally and across the
[51:55] world and amen Israel is a prophetic
[51:59] time
[52:01] piece when we look at Israel we see
[52:04] Israel in battle and you can know that
[52:07] the church is in
[52:10] battle Israel is just a small little
[52:13] Nation the true church is just a small
[52:17] group of people it's always been a small
[52:20] group of people when Jesus was on the
[52:23] earth it was only a handful that
[52:25] actually recog recognized the word made
[52:29] flesh before
[52:31] them it's always been a small group and
[52:35] it's going to be a small group right to
[52:37] the end and we're a part of that small
[52:39] group because we've been given ears to
[52:42] hear we've been given the spirit of
[52:45] Revelation to understand the word of God
[52:48] for this day and for this hour Israel is
[52:51] a minority the true church is a minority
[52:54] Israel is being rejected because she is
[52:57] a chosen people the true church is being
[53:00] rejected because she is chosen as the
[53:04] Bride of Jesus Christ
[53:07] amen people don't like to hear that
[53:10] there's a chosen Church yeah but it's
[53:13] the truth it's directly from the word
[53:17] amen he says my sheep hear my
[53:21] voice and so how can people that that
[53:24] hear his voice have different inter
[53:26] interpretations on the word of God it's
[53:29] impossible once the spirit of God comes
[53:33] into you as an individual there is no
[53:36] way that you can deny the word of God
[53:40] you cannot have a different
[53:42] interpretation because it's the spirit
[53:45] of Truth in you that interprets the word
[53:49] amen thank you Jes Hallelujah when you
[53:52] truly understand that the Lord never
[53:54] changes his word about any
[53:57] that he says then you can trust
[54:00] 100% that the Lord will keep his
[54:05] word the Lord doesn't
[54:08] change that's why we stand where we
[54:11] stand amen because we know that the Lord
[54:14] will not change his mind about his
[54:19] word
[54:21] hallelujah and so just laying in that as
[54:25] a background I want you to understand
[54:27] where our thought is coming from today
[54:30] is that we're looking at the church
[54:33] we're looking at Israel and we're
[54:35] looking at it in relevance to God's time
[54:38] piece we know that God uh that Israel is
[54:42] God's time pieace but the
[54:44] bride also
[54:46] represents God's time pieace when the
[54:49] bride receives rapturing Faith which
[54:53] he's now under for a body change and the
[54:57] church is raptured that's going to be
[55:00] another sign to this earth that God's
[55:05] time piece is moving on amen amen and so
[55:09] we are represented in all of
[55:12] that and so today how many re how many
[55:16] realize that we're in the the festive
[55:19] Feast the Jewish feast um of rash
[55:23] hashana
[55:25] amen amen
[55:27] well these feasts are the peak of the
[55:32] high holidays of the Jewish people amen
[55:35] it started actually
[55:38] on October the
[55:41] 2nd and it's going to end on October the
[55:44] 12th with yam Kapur yes which is the
[55:48] time of
[55:49] atonement and so during that
[55:53] time the Jewish people go into a great
[55:57] time of feast and also a great time of
[56:01] reflection rashash Shana represents the
[56:05] new year it represents the creation of
[56:09] the universe to the Jews it represents
[56:12] Adam and
[56:14] Eve the creation back in the Garden of
[56:16] Eden and we know how it represents Adam
[56:19] and Eve we know how it represents the
[56:23] church Christ and the church Eve
[56:27] we know that all of this is part of
[56:29] God's Plan of
[56:31] Redemption you know the Jewish people
[56:34] have a a a a real you know
[56:37] genuine understanding of the word of
[56:40] God but they were blind it purposely not
[56:44] to recognize the Messiah so that we
[56:48] could receive our sight
[56:51] amen now what takes place during this
[56:54] festive time is the blowing of the
[57:00] chofar and you know listen to brother
[57:03] brandom here he speaks here he says now
[57:05] watch notice and the Lord spake Moses
[57:09] saying also in the 10th day of the
[57:12] seventh month there shall be a day of
[57:16] atonement notice 10th day seventh month
[57:21] atonement is to recognize
[57:24] Messiah 10 7 Revelations 10:7 was our
[57:30] time to recognize
[57:33] Messiah that he would unveil himself to
[57:37] us just in the same way that that as we
[57:41] progress the Messiah Jesus Christ will
[57:44] unveil himself to
[57:47] Israel and but listen he says but see
[57:49] the atonement followed watch now the
[57:53] atonement followed the trumpet sound see
[57:57] how beautiful see the atonement day
[57:59] followed the trumpet now the 50 days of
[58:03] the trumpets for us symbolize when the
[58:06] trumpet sounded at
[58:08] Pentecost we know that what that
[58:11] represented which was the 50 days now
[58:14] now after this the Jews
[58:18] rejected so in the time when Christ came
[58:22] to us to reveal himself to us they
[58:26] rejected the Messiah but they were
[58:28] blinded to do
[58:32] so but here now after this the Jews
[58:35] rejected that now the trumpets is to
[58:38] call them back to that atonement see the
[58:43] atonement they rejected and they
[58:45] rejected so our eyes could be opened
[58:49] theirs was closed and during this time
[58:53] these seals opened up and the trumpets
[58:56] blowed and now in the blowing of the
[58:58] trumpets just before Messiah comes cuz
[59:03] they've got to be in
[59:06] Palestine and you remember God had to
[59:09] harden Pharaoh's heart to run them out
[59:11] of Egypt and to harden Stalin musolini
[59:15] and all that to get them back into the
[59:18] promised land where the
[59:21] 144,000 is supposed to be and now for
[59:25] the first time thousands of years 2500
[59:28] years that Israel is a nation with its
[59:32] own flag its own Army and all and it's
[59:35] considered in the U the UN first time
[59:39] it's been the oldest flag that ever flew
[59:43] on
[59:44] Earth at this time flies again the
[59:48] six-point star of
[59:50] David he said he'd lifted that end sign
[59:53] in the last days when she'd be coming
[59:57] back we're at the end there is just no
[1:00:02] doubt about it we're here that's brother
[1:00:05] Brandon from the Feast of the
[1:00:07] trumpets and
[1:00:09] so during this time of
[1:00:13] Celebration Israel goes
[1:00:15] into a time of
[1:00:20] reflection and the sounding of the of
[1:00:22] the trumpets for them because they'll
[1:00:24] sound the chofar every day while they're
[1:00:28] in this Feast of rash
[1:00:33] hashana and it'll end on the 10th day
[1:00:37] with yam Kapur and it'll be the time of
[1:00:41] the atonement and and during this this
[1:00:45] time of feast and Festival of rashash
[1:00:49] Shana the Jews are examining
[1:00:53] themselves they're repenting about the
[1:00:56] things that they that they did over the
[1:00:59] last year they're reflecting on the
[1:01:01] previous year and they're looking to see
[1:01:04] what it is that you know that that they
[1:01:06] need to uh change in their lives they're
[1:01:09] they're reflecting on on you know what's
[1:01:12] most important have they lost touch and
[1:01:16] communication with God I trust this is
[1:01:19] speaking to you this morning a time of
[1:01:23] reflection to repent to look you know to
[1:01:26] look back and say hey you know what I've
[1:01:28] lost sight of my walk with god I've lost
[1:01:30] sight with what's most
[1:01:33] important I'm not paying attention to
[1:01:36] the things that I should be paying
[1:01:37] attention to I'm doing wrong to those
[1:01:40] that I love and and you know all of
[1:01:43] these things and and you know the Jewish
[1:01:45] people they they take it very seriously
[1:01:48] and they go and they you know they try
[1:01:50] to make things right and I believe that
[1:01:54] you know um we as human beings here on
[1:01:57] this Earth we you know we get into
[1:01:59] situations and times in our lives where
[1:02:02] we you know where we where we do things
[1:02:04] that we don't want to do we say things
[1:02:06] we don't want to say and it's important
[1:02:09] for us to reflect upon those
[1:02:13] times they would blow that chofar so
[1:02:16] that the people would know hey wake
[1:02:20] up it's time to recognize the hour that
[1:02:24] we're living in
[1:02:27] it was a time where it would lead to
[1:02:29] their day of atonement yam
[1:02:33] Kapur and you know uh Israel is is going
[1:02:36] to receive their Awakening but there's
[1:02:38] still some that are in the church
[1:02:40] because we're talking about the church
[1:02:42] and
[1:02:43] Israel there's some that are still in
[1:02:46] the church that are not
[1:02:47] awake they haven't recognized the hour
[1:02:51] of Jesus Christ and the word that God
[1:02:54] has provided for for this day for the
[1:02:57] Church the true church of the bride of
[1:03:01] Christ
[1:03:03] amen and so you know we need to look and
[1:03:07] and see what it is that we need to let
[1:03:09] go
[1:03:11] of certain things we need to let go of
[1:03:13] certain things that we need to you know
[1:03:16] maybe somebody that we need to
[1:03:18] forgive you know maybe something that
[1:03:20] we've been holding and you know when you
[1:03:22] hold
[1:03:23] unforgiveness in you you know what it
[1:03:26] does it hinders
[1:03:30] you and it hinders you from being
[1:03:33] delivered from the situation that you're
[1:03:36] holding
[1:03:37] unforgiveness
[1:03:40] towards so it's important for us to
[1:03:44] reflect and look and see where it is
[1:03:48] that you know how it is that that that
[1:03:50] we've you know we've
[1:03:53] left our first love
[1:03:58] amen praise
[1:04:01] God and so at this time I'm GNA ask
[1:04:04] brother Bill to blow the
[1:04:07] chofar and I'd like him to blow it seven
[1:04:11] times representing the Seven Seals and
[1:04:15] the Seven trumpets and then one last
[1:04:19] eighth blow which represents the time
[1:04:22] that we are now living in which is the
[1:04:25] eternal etal Church age the time where
[1:04:28] Christ is
[1:04:31] reflecting and making himself known
[1:04:34] personally because that's what the great
[1:04:37] atonement is going to
[1:04:38] do to us personally to Israel as a
[1:04:43] nation in one day and as he blows the
[1:04:47] chauffeur let it draw your thoughts and
[1:04:50] your
[1:04:54] attention and reflect ref on the Lord
[1:04:57] and your walk with him go ahead brother
[1:05:00] Bill Let's bow our heads
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:47] [Music]
[1:05:49] amen praise God
[1:05:56] at this time of
[1:05:57] celebration for the Jewish people in
[1:06:01] rash
[1:06:02] hashana they celebrate they come
[1:06:05] together they feast and they start the
[1:06:08] year with
[1:06:11] sweets they put out these big tables
[1:06:14] with sweets and they'll use cut up
[1:06:18] apples and honey and they'll dip the
[1:06:20] apples into the honey because they want
[1:06:22] to start the year fresh they want to
[1:06:26] start a new year sweet a reflection to
[1:06:31] them that if we start the the year in a
[1:06:34] sweet way it'll end in a sweet way and
[1:06:37] they'll come together and they'll
[1:06:39] they'll look at how they can prosper in
[1:06:42] the new year and you know that um how
[1:06:46] they can treat one another and how they
[1:06:48] can help one another in in this time of
[1:06:52] reflection as they they come to this
[1:06:55] time
[1:06:56] of
[1:06:57] atonement amen and we as Christians can
[1:07:01] learn from this that if we want a
[1:07:03] sweeter
[1:07:04] future we need to examine ourselves and
[1:07:07] have a fresh start in Christ you can
[1:07:10] start fresh right here right now today
[1:07:14] you can have a fresh start in Christ
[1:07:16] amen knowing that that the blood of
[1:07:19] Christ cleanses you and purges you of
[1:07:24] all sin and in unbelief amen praise God
[1:07:29] and
[1:07:31] so
[1:07:34] um we're going to be looking
[1:07:42] now at Genesis 15
[1:07:46] 1:3 okay now we we just kind of laid in
[1:07:49] a foundation here with Israel okay I'm
[1:07:52] just doing as the Lord kind of directed
[1:07:54] me to put this together amen and so from
[1:07:58] it you will draw from it whatever it is
[1:08:00] that the Lord is revealing personally to
[1:08:03] you amen but here we are we're living in
[1:08:07] a time where Israel is at War we're
[1:08:10] looking at Israel as God's time piece
[1:08:14] we've recognized that that um Israel is
[1:08:18] is is is God's way of telling us that
[1:08:22] have our understanding open to
[1:08:25] understand the word of God what it is
[1:08:27] that he is doing and so I thought you
[1:08:30] know and the Lord just led me he says
[1:08:32] just lay uh you know a a
[1:08:36] foundation and let the people know that
[1:08:39] what is going on in Israel right now is
[1:08:43] not something that just started this
[1:08:46] year it's not something that you know
[1:08:48] that that's just been going on since
[1:08:51] 1948 it goes back thousands of years and
[1:08:55] so today in order for us to to have a
[1:08:58] clear understanding of what is really
[1:09:01] going on we want to look at the history
[1:09:03] we want to take a look at you know the
[1:09:06] foundation and why it is that all these
[1:09:10] nations have come against
[1:09:13] Israel and here now some observations
[1:09:16] that that I want to bring to your
[1:09:18] attention before we read the scripture
[1:09:22] the population in Israel is just over 9
[1:09:25] million people of that 7.2 million are
[1:09:30] Jews 2.2 million are Arabs and about
[1:09:34] 550,000 of them are non-jew and
[1:09:39] non-arab
[1:09:41] Israel in you know according to to to a
[1:09:44] research
[1:09:46] poll is the fifth most hated country in
[1:09:50] the
[1:09:51] world out of 30 they're the fifth most
[1:09:55] hated
[1:09:56] country you know fourth to North Korea
[1:10:00] because it's probably going in your mind
[1:10:01] third to Russia believe it or not the
[1:10:04] second most hated country in the world
[1:10:08] is the
[1:10:10] USA sad but it's
[1:10:13] true and the number one
[1:10:19] China now Israel is geographically
[1:10:22] surrounded by over 250 million mother
[1:10:26] Muslims of which a huge amount of
[1:10:30] them those that are
[1:10:32] anointed of the of the of the evil
[1:10:35] spirits and the and the the powers and
[1:10:37] the principalities that started right
[1:10:40] back from before the foundations of the
[1:10:42] world Satan and all of his
[1:10:47] angels there's a huge amount of them
[1:10:49] that want to annihilate Israel and
[1:10:51] remove it right off the face of the
[1:10:53] Earth
[1:10:56] yet for a small country they seem to
[1:10:58] have been able to hold their ground and
[1:11:02] defend
[1:11:04] themselves you go
[1:11:07] back right to the Book of Genesis and
[1:11:10] you will see how Israel was always a
[1:11:12] minority but yet God was always right
[1:11:17] there with them to defend them to stand
[1:11:20] next to them and to and you know just
[1:11:23] like when when when uh uh uh Elijah was
[1:11:27] there and uh and his uh servant was with
[1:11:31] him and and said Lord we're
[1:11:34] surrounded you know El said open his
[1:11:37] eyes Lord that he can see what is really
[1:11:40] around
[1:11:41] us I want you to know that you like
[1:11:45] Israel are a minority in this day when
[1:11:47] you stand for the word of
[1:11:51] God but yet you might appear to be a
[1:11:54] minority uity but you are surrounded by
[1:11:57] the power and by the anointing and by
[1:12:00] the angels of God in whatever situations
[1:12:03] that you deal with whatever you face you
[1:12:06] are encamped
[1:12:08] about and listen there is no doubt it's
[1:12:13] a proven fact that Israel is not
[1:12:17] alone they are a small country there are
[1:12:20] only 7 million you know Israelites in
[1:12:24] Israel
[1:12:26] but yet for a country that's surrounded
[1:12:28] by over 250 million
[1:12:33] Muslims they stand their ground amen
[1:12:37] thank you Jesus there's thousands of
[1:12:39] denominations out
[1:12:41] there but the True Church of Jesus
[1:12:45] Christ is not a
[1:12:48] denomination it is the literal mystical
[1:12:52] living body of Jesus Christ in this day
[1:12:56] and in this hour amen hallelujah
[1:12:59] amen a small country yet they seem to
[1:13:01] hold their ground they have with stod
[1:13:03] and continue to withstand terrorist
[1:13:06] attacks that are known to be backed by
[1:13:09] many Muslim
[1:13:12] Iranian Arab Muslim backed
[1:13:16] proxies we know that we're not we're not
[1:13:19] pointing to the people we're looking at
[1:13:22] the spiritual powers and dominions that
[1:13:25] operate as evil through
[1:13:29] people somebody out there that just went
[1:13:32] and committed
[1:13:33] murder that person was anointed of a
[1:13:38] spirit and many times you'll see them
[1:13:40] where they'll come out of it and they'll
[1:13:42] weep and cry not realizing what was what
[1:13:45] was on them controlling them to to do
[1:13:48] the things that they
[1:13:50] did it's because these evil spirits
[1:13:54] they're real
[1:13:56] anybody that has has evil enough to go
[1:14:01] in like they did a year ago tomorrow
[1:14:05] where they went in and they attacked
[1:14:07] innocent Israelites that were at a
[1:14:10] concert killing over 1,200 people men
[1:14:14] women and children slaughtering them in
[1:14:17] front of their parents listen I know
[1:14:19] that this is It's a touchy
[1:14:22] subject okay there's a lot of people out
[1:14:25] there that they're blaming Israel and
[1:14:28] then there's those that recognize and
[1:14:31] and we as the church we are thinking and
[1:14:34] operating from a spiritual revelation we
[1:14:38] are not operating by the flesh when we
[1:14:41] look at the people that are being
[1:14:43] slaughtered and the the bombs that are
[1:14:45] dropping and killing innocent people we
[1:14:48] feel the pain as human beings if you're
[1:14:52] not human if you're human you can't say
[1:14:56] you don't feel the pain of this this
[1:15:00] wickedness but yet evil is
[1:15:04] present evil is
[1:15:06] real and it would be foolish for us as
[1:15:10] humans and Christians to call evil
[1:15:14] good so it's not like we're saying oh
[1:15:17] it's good that you know that that that
[1:15:20] that Israel is killing these people or
[1:15:22] or anything like that no we we know that
[1:15:25] we fight not against flesh and blood we
[1:15:29] realize that for Israel right now it's
[1:15:32] it's all
[1:15:34] natural because they're defending the
[1:15:36] land that God gave
[1:15:39] them amen praise God and
[1:15:44] so since Israel's foundation in
[1:15:51] 1948 military conscription has been a
[1:15:55] Central pillar of National
[1:15:57] Defense okay Israel makes it mandatory
[1:16:02] that a man once he hits the a of the age
[1:16:05] of 18 he enlists and he goes to the to
[1:16:09] the Army for he goes and and he goes to
[1:16:12] the military for 32 months of
[1:16:15] training so that if there be a need to
[1:16:19] defend their
[1:16:21] country they got to be ready to step up
[1:16:25] and don't think you know if if you were
[1:16:27] to go to Israel I've listened to
[1:16:28] testimonies of people talking about uh
[1:16:32] being in Israel okay just over the last
[1:16:35] year while this has all been going on
[1:16:38] testifying how the young people are
[1:16:41] ready to take their
[1:16:44] place it's in them to defend their
[1:16:49] country to stand for their
[1:16:52] Nation because of what God has instilled
[1:16:57] in them by the word of God through the
[1:17:00] teachings of the word of
[1:17:03] God so it's not like these young people
[1:17:07] are not ready to take their position
[1:17:10] they're ready to go to war because they
[1:17:14] believe in
[1:17:16] what Israel stands for they believe that
[1:17:20] God gave them the land and we now are
[1:17:24] going to looking at the word of God to
[1:17:26] see how it is that God actually gave
[1:17:29] them the land and how the promise is to
[1:17:34] the nation of Israel and that the land
[1:17:37] is rightfully owned by the nation of
[1:17:41] Israel because the creator of the
[1:17:44] universe gave it to them amen so
[1:17:48] let's dig in here after these things the
[1:17:53] word of the Lord came unto Abra ABR
[1:17:55] Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram
[1:17:59] I am thy shield and thy exceeding great
[1:18:01] reward and ABR said Lord God what Willl
[1:18:05] thou give me seeing I go childless and
[1:18:09] the steward of my house is this eleazer
[1:18:12] of Damascus in other words he was
[1:18:14] wondering well the Lord was going to you
[1:18:16] know bless him and and make him a great
[1:18:19] nation but how is he going to do it and
[1:18:21] and Abram turns around and says will you
[1:18:23] use Damascus I mean will you use
[1:18:26] Eleazar my servant to be my
[1:18:30] Heir and ab Abram said behold to me thou
[1:18:34] has given no
[1:18:36] seed and lo one born in my house is mine
[1:18:41] air so God had not given him Abraham had
[1:18:45] not had any children
[1:18:47] yet but God had come to Abraham to call
[1:18:51] him out so that he could be
[1:18:56] God's chosen
[1:19:00] people now go to the next
[1:19:02] scripture and behold the word of the
[1:19:05] Lord came unto him saying this shall not
[1:19:09] be thine Heir another words not
[1:19:12] eleazer but he that shall come forth out
[1:19:15] of thine own bowels shall be thine air
[1:19:19] and he brought him forth abroad and said
[1:19:22] look now towards heaven and tell and
[1:19:26] tell the Stars if thou be able to number
[1:19:29] them and he said unto him so shall thy
[1:19:32] seed be and he believed in the Lord and
[1:19:36] he counted it to him for
[1:19:40] righteousness amen praise
[1:19:50] God so now let's go to the next
[1:19:52] scripture
[1:19:56] Genesis
[1:19:57] 16:1 now Sarah Abraham's Abram's wife
[1:20:02] bear him no children so there was no
[1:20:05] children yet but yet God gave and made a
[1:20:07] promise to
[1:20:10] Abraham and she had a hands handmaid an
[1:20:13] Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarai
[1:20:16] said unto Abram behold now the Lord hath
[1:20:19] restained me restrained me from bearing
[1:20:23] I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be
[1:20:27] that I may obtain children by her and
[1:20:31] Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarah
[1:20:34] and Sarah Abraham's wife took Hagar her
[1:20:37] maid the Egyptian after Abraham had
[1:20:40] dealt dwelt 10 years in the land of
[1:20:43] Canaan and gave her to uh to her husband
[1:20:47] and gave her to her husband Abraham to
[1:20:50] be his wife and he went in unto Hagar
[1:20:53] and she concealed conceived and when she
[1:20:56] saw that she had conceived her mistress
[1:20:59] was despised in her
[1:21:02] eyes and so we see here now that
[1:21:06] through
[1:21:08] unbelief Sarah just didn't unbelief just
[1:21:14] didn't believe that that you know God
[1:21:15] could keep the promise of you know
[1:21:19] potentially uh she said how could it be
[1:21:21] that I can have children so the only way
[1:21:24] that I can do this is I'm going to have
[1:21:25] to you know give her give Abraham my my
[1:21:28] maid you know Hagar and
[1:21:34] Hagar went to be with
[1:21:36] Abram and conceived and all of a sudden
[1:21:42] emnity comes up into Sarah you see
[1:21:45] because when you're in sin things just
[1:21:48] don't feel
[1:21:50] right things just don't look right
[1:21:52] things don't sit right on all of a
[1:21:54] sudden you're just uncomfortable about
[1:21:57] everything and here now she's like she
[1:22:00] gets into a condition and realizes that
[1:22:04] you know what what have I done here you
[1:22:07] know now all of a sudden so let's read
[1:22:09] on Genesis 16:10 and the angel of the
[1:22:12] Lord said unto her I will
[1:22:20] multiply
[1:22:22] sorry Genesis 16 1610 and the angel of
[1:22:26] the Lord said unto her I will multiply
[1:22:28] thy seed exceedingly that it shall not
[1:22:31] be numbered for multitude now sorry here
[1:22:34] I got to go back to my notes Here what
[1:22:36] happened here okay is first of all we
[1:22:40] need to understand that
[1:22:43] Hagar became pregnant and she got all
[1:22:48] you know uh realized that that Sarah
[1:22:51] wanted her out and she got all
[1:22:53] discouraged and she you know she she
[1:22:55] went and left the tribe and was and went
[1:22:58] out into the Wilderness and the Holy
[1:23:00] Spirit God sent an angel to go and speak
[1:23:03] to her and to tell her that just wait a
[1:23:07] minute here because you are actually
[1:23:08] going to fulfill a plan that I have for
[1:23:12] the children of Israel you see God had a
[1:23:15] plan in his mind it's called The Plan of
[1:23:17] Redemption and God is going to play out
[1:23:20] this whole plan and he's going to show
[1:23:22] how it's all going to come to pass and
[1:23:24] here now she is the bonds woman that is
[1:23:28] going to bring forth a son and the angel
[1:23:31] of the Lord said unto her now speaking
[1:23:33] to Hagar I will multiply thy seed
[1:23:35] exceedingly that it shall not be
[1:23:37] numbered for multitude and the angel of
[1:23:40] the Lord said unto her behold thou art
[1:23:43] with child and shalt bear a son and
[1:23:46] shall call his name Ishmael now that
[1:23:50] child that was born to Hagar is to this
[1:23:53] day
[1:23:55] where the nations of the Muslims
[1:23:59] worldwide
[1:24:02] originated
[1:24:04] Ishmael is the son of
[1:24:08] Abraham they have a right when the
[1:24:11] Muslims say that that that Abraham is
[1:24:14] their father they have a right to say
[1:24:17] that but yet Ishmael was not the
[1:24:21] promised son let's let's read on now
[1:24:23] because the Lord had heard thy
[1:24:26] Affliction and he will be a now listen
[1:24:29] he will be a wild
[1:24:31] man he's describing the character that
[1:24:35] is going to be in
[1:24:38] Ishmael his hand will be against every
[1:24:42] man it's like you know if you don't
[1:24:46] believe what they
[1:24:48] believe and they're anointed of that
[1:24:51] spirit it's Jihad it's holy war it's
[1:24:56] annihilate
[1:24:58] them that's how they look at
[1:25:02] Christians when they stand solely and
[1:25:05] wholly on the word of God and and and
[1:25:08] and tell them this is what's true
[1:25:11] here right away they get
[1:25:15] wild
[1:25:16] amen and his hand will be against every
[1:25:19] man and every man's hand against him and
[1:25:22] he shall dwell in the presence of all
[1:25:25] his
[1:25:28] Brethren not in the presence of the
[1:25:32] Lord but here
[1:25:39] now God makes this unconditional
[1:25:42] Covenant with Abraham now let's look at
[1:25:45] covenant for a minute if you don't know
[1:25:47] what a covenant is it's a formal
[1:25:48] contractual promise between two
[1:25:52] individuals now there are two basic
[1:25:54] types of covenants in the Bible there's
[1:25:57] conditional and
[1:25:59] unconditional conditional Covenant
[1:26:01] requires actions from both parties
[1:26:04] involved in the Covenant in today's
[1:26:07] terms you could you know compare it to
[1:26:11] like a mortgage on a home the borrower
[1:26:13] of the home promises to give you money
[1:26:16] you promise to pay it with interest
[1:26:19] that's a mortgage unconditional
[1:26:22] covenants are those who the the greater
[1:26:24] of the two parties promises to do
[1:26:28] something for the person who they are
[1:26:31] entering into this promise with it's
[1:26:34] also called a royal Grant Covenant where
[1:26:38] a king gives a reward to a faithful
[1:26:41] subject for a service rendered and that
[1:26:44] Covenant is irrevocable because it's
[1:26:47] based on the word of the
[1:26:51] king and listen God made a covenant with
[1:26:54] you and me because we are the Seed of
[1:26:57] Abraham God made an unconditional
[1:27:01] Covenant that we would receive our
[1:27:04] Promised
[1:27:05] Land amen and that nothing could take it
[1:27:10] away now listen
[1:27:12] here in this in this uh in the essence
[1:27:16] of this Covenant Abraham believing the
[1:27:19] word of God as stated that Abraham
[1:27:23] believed in in verse
[1:27:24] in in Genesis 15:6 Abraham believed God
[1:27:28] and it was credited to him as
[1:27:31] righteousness God was so impressed by
[1:27:34] Abraham's faith that he gave him this
[1:27:38] promise and to Abraham's
[1:27:43] descendants
[1:27:45] forever it's an unconditional Covenant
[1:27:48] amen praise God Abraham he questioned
[1:27:52] God when he said that he couldn't have
[1:27:54] any children but God assured Abraham
[1:27:57] that this would come to pass amen amen
[1:28:01] praise God and so here now let's go to
[1:28:04] the next
[1:28:05] scripture and I will make my Covenant
[1:28:08] between me and thee and will multiply
[1:28:10] thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his
[1:28:14] face and God talked with him saying as
[1:28:17] for me behold my Covenant is with thee
[1:28:22] and thou shalt be a father of many
[1:28:25] nations neither shall thy name anymore
[1:28:28] be called Abram but thy name Shall be
[1:28:31] Called Abraham father of
[1:28:35] Nations for a father of many nations
[1:28:37] have I made thee and I will make thee
[1:28:40] exceedingly fruitful and I will make
[1:28:42] nations of thee and Kings shall come out
[1:28:46] of thee and I will establish my Covenant
[1:28:49] between me and thee and thy seed after
[1:28:52] thee in their gener ations for an
[1:28:55] Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto
[1:28:58] thee and to thy seed after thee amen
[1:29:03] aren't you
[1:29:04] thankful that God made this
[1:29:07] unconditional promise amen praise God
[1:29:11] let's go to the next
[1:29:12] slide now watch and God said unto
[1:29:15] Abraham as for
[1:29:17] Sarah her name Thou shalt not call her
[1:29:21] name Sarai but Sarah shall be her name
[1:29:26] and I will bless her and give thee a son
[1:29:30] also of
[1:29:32] her and I will bless
[1:29:36] her yay I will bless her and she shall
[1:29:40] be a mother of Nations Kings of people
[1:29:44] shall be of her then Abraham fell upon
[1:29:47] his face and laughed and said in his
[1:29:50] heart shall a child be born unto him
[1:29:53] that is a hundred years
[1:29:55] old imagine God comes to him at 100
[1:29:58] years old there had to be some
[1:30:01] miraculous Faith being
[1:30:03] revealed to Abraham and shall Sarah that
[1:30:07] is 90 years old bear and Abraham said
[1:30:11] unto God oh that Ishmael might live
[1:30:14] before thee you know he was he was you
[1:30:17] know kind of in his mind he was just
[1:30:20] just
[1:30:22] boggled but yet he knew knew that
[1:30:24] nothing was impossible for God and we
[1:30:27] get into Times just like Abraham here
[1:30:30] you know we can get into Times where
[1:30:32] situations around us look like oh my God
[1:30:34] like I know I believe God's word I know
[1:30:37] that there's nothing that God can't do
[1:30:40] but yet boy I don't know about this
[1:30:42] situation and all of a sudden you find
[1:30:44] yourself in a backslidden condition you
[1:30:46] find yourself doubting God and his
[1:30:49] ability to to do what he promised that
[1:30:52] he would do God God said that this
[1:30:55] church is going to go into Rapture God
[1:30:57] said that this church is not going into
[1:30:59] the Great Tribulation amen God says that
[1:31:02] he's going to take us he's going to
[1:31:04] change these mortal bodies he's going to
[1:31:07] make them Immortal we shall put on
[1:31:10] immortality it sounds Supernatural it
[1:31:13] sounds unrealistic the people might
[1:31:16] think you're a little cuckoo man you
[1:31:18] think you're going to change Dimensions
[1:31:20] you think you're going to leave this
[1:31:21] Dimension and go into another dimension
[1:31:24] what are you talking about just like
[1:31:27] Abraham but Abraham staggered not at the
[1:31:30] promises of God
[1:31:33] hallelujah amen read the next verse here
[1:31:38] from 19 and God said Sarah thy wife
[1:31:40] shall bear thee a son indeed and thou
[1:31:43] shalt call his name Isaac God knew
[1:31:47] exactly what he was going to do God knew
[1:31:52] that he was going to have a nation
[1:31:53] called by his name according to his word
[1:31:57] and it was going to come according to
[1:31:59] the way he said it that's why nobody can
[1:32:03] change what God said about Israel you
[1:32:06] can you can fuss and hum and ha and and
[1:32:10] get upset and oh cut you know like Paris
[1:32:13] says cut off the arms don't send them
[1:32:15] any more ammunition don't send them any
[1:32:18] more tools for war you know cut them off
[1:32:20] we need to cut off Israel you know the
[1:32:23] there's so many people saying this is
[1:32:25] not right what Israel is doing you know
[1:32:28] listen it's the murder and the and the
[1:32:31] and and the deaths and everything else
[1:32:34] of course it's
[1:32:35] terrible but it's not we're but we're
[1:32:38] not thinking from a natural perspective
[1:32:40] here we need to see this spiritually
[1:32:44] what God is showing us in the word of
[1:32:47] God that we fight not against flesh and
[1:32:49] blood this world is in a condition right
[1:32:52] now where our family are being attacked
[1:32:55] y listen you see Israel being attacked
[1:32:58] naturally over there we are being
[1:33:00] attacked naturally over here too amen
[1:33:03] our families are being
[1:33:05] attacked they want to take the word of
[1:33:07] God out of the schools they want to
[1:33:09] place all kinds of different genders
[1:33:11] upon our children they don't realize
[1:33:14] what that does to their minds it it it
[1:33:17] it it destroys their true
[1:33:20] identity it puts them into a state of
[1:33:22] confusion where they don't know who they
[1:33:25] are and what ends up happening they get
[1:33:28] to places where students all of a sudden
[1:33:30] they'll get akas and they'll go into a
[1:33:32] high school and they'll shoot 30 or 40
[1:33:35] people because of their mental condition
[1:33:39] that that that is being bombarded upon
[1:33:41] the
[1:33:42] people there's oppression all around us
[1:33:47] it's not just Israel at War the true
[1:33:51] church the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:33:54] that believe God's word she's trying to
[1:33:57] hold the ground around her life but
[1:34:01] thanks be to God Jesus Christ said I'll
[1:34:04] be with you even in
[1:34:07] you we will not stagger at the promises
[1:34:10] of God amen hallelujah thank you Jes and
[1:34:14] he says here I will establish my
[1:34:16] Covenant with you with him for an
[1:34:19] Everlasting Covenant and with his seed
[1:34:22] after him talking about
[1:34:25] Isaac nowhere anywhere look what he says
[1:34:29] and as for
[1:34:31] Ishmael here it is I have heard thee
[1:34:35] behold I have blessed him and I will
[1:34:37] make him fruitful and will multiply him
[1:34:42] exceedingly 12 princes shall he beget
[1:34:45] and I will make him a great nation but
[1:34:49] my Covenant no but he goes right back he
[1:34:52] says but
[1:34:54] my Covenant and I'll just elaborate on
[1:34:57] all that is not with
[1:35:00] Ishmael my Covenant is not with the
[1:35:03] Muslim
[1:35:04] nations my Covenant is not with
[1:35:08] denomination amen my Covenant is my word
[1:35:13] and my Covenant is with
[1:35:16] Isaac Hallelujah but my Covenant will I
[1:35:20] establish with Isaac which Sarah
[1:35:25] shall bear unto thee at this set time in
[1:35:30] the next year you see God was making
[1:35:33] very clear here we're trying to lay in a
[1:35:36] foundation so that we as Christians can
[1:35:39] have the right understanding of this
[1:35:43] war and more than that this is only a
[1:35:46] foundation so that you can understand
[1:35:49] what it is that's happening around us
[1:35:51] but you need to see that there there's
[1:35:53] an Awakening taking
[1:35:55] place that the things that took place
[1:35:58] what I read here at the very beginning
[1:36:00] of the service what I was talking about
[1:36:02] were God showing these signs in the
[1:36:04] heavens and the solar eclipse and the
[1:36:07] and the blackout because the Gentile
[1:36:10] dispensation remember the Gentile
[1:36:12] dispensation has to come to a total
[1:36:16] completion to where it becomes where God
[1:36:19] is no longer dealing with the Gentiles
[1:36:23] and focuses completely and wholly over
[1:36:26] to
[1:36:28] Israel and we don't want to get
[1:36:31] distracted by this
[1:36:33] war we don't want to get distracted and
[1:36:36] pulled in by the political aspects of it
[1:36:40] we don't want to be drawn in to where we
[1:36:42] start to get political with our families
[1:36:44] and and and you know start to take
[1:36:46] positions and agree with this and
[1:36:49] disagree with that we need to let them
[1:36:52] know prophetically by the word of God
[1:36:56] and show them in the scripture and
[1:36:58] that's why we're going through these I
[1:36:59] know you've seen this I know you've read
[1:37:02] this but this there's never been a time
[1:37:05] such as this amen there's never been a
[1:37:07] time where where things have to be
[1:37:09] clarified where God is reminding us of
[1:37:12] his promise to you and to
[1:37:16] Israel God is reminding us the time and
[1:37:19] the season that we're living in so that
[1:37:21] we can act according ly and be aware of
[1:37:25] our surroundings what it is that God is
[1:37:27] doing in our lives how it is that the
[1:37:30] word of God is something that that we
[1:37:32] stand upon and and that we if we're
[1:37:35] going to share a word we need to share
[1:37:38] the present
[1:37:39] truth we don't want to be
[1:37:41] sharing
[1:37:43] fables we want to be sharing exactly
[1:37:47] what God is doing in this hour aware
[1:37:51] with our eyes open so that we can talk
[1:37:53] to people and and know where we stand
[1:37:58] scripturally
[1:38:01] Hallelujah so here
[1:38:04] now we'll go to the next
[1:38:07] scripture and the Lord visited Sarah as
[1:38:11] he had
[1:38:12] said and I guarantee you if there's a
[1:38:15] promise that God has given you God has
[1:38:18] promised you things in this
[1:38:21] life he will
[1:38:24] meet those
[1:38:25] promises he will provide you with those
[1:38:29] needs he will he will heal you he will
[1:38:32] restore your Finance he will restore
[1:38:35] your relationships he will restore all
[1:38:38] those things Hallelujah he said as he
[1:38:42] had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as
[1:38:45] he had spoken for Sarah conceived and
[1:38:48] bear Abraham a son in his old age and at
[1:38:52] the set time of which God had spoken to
[1:38:55] him and Abraham called the name of his
[1:38:58] son that was born unto him whom Sarah
[1:39:02] bear to him
[1:39:05] Isaac Hallelujah that was the promise of
[1:39:11] God and it was
[1:39:14] fulfilled glory to God
[1:39:25] hallah let's look at Romans
[1:39:31] 4:17 now as it is written I have made
[1:39:35] thee a father of many nations before him
[1:39:38] whom he believed even God who quickeneth
[1:39:43] the dead and calleth those things which
[1:39:45] be not as though they were Oh Glory to
[1:39:49] God hallelujah listen it seemed
[1:39:52] impossible to Abraham
[1:39:54] it didn't seem possible to
[1:39:56] Sarah there's things that don't seem
[1:39:59] possible around our lives I got things
[1:40:02] around my life right now that look
[1:40:05] impossible but I'm not looking at the
[1:40:08] circumstances and and I'm not looking at
[1:40:10] the word
[1:40:11] impossible I'm looking at the scripture
[1:40:13] where Jesus said all things are
[1:40:16] possible to them that believe that's
[1:40:20] what I'm looking
[1:40:21] at that's what we're
[1:40:24] trusting and call those things which be
[1:40:27] not as though they were who against hope
[1:40:30] believed in hope that he might become
[1:40:33] the father he's talking about Abraham
[1:40:35] here the father of many nations
[1:40:37] according to that which was spoken so
[1:40:41] shall thy seed
[1:40:43] be and we are Abraham's seed Hallelujah
[1:40:48] we can claim the same promises today
[1:40:52] Hallelujah the same promises that God
[1:40:54] made to Abraham to Sarah we can claim
[1:40:57] them today and being not weak in faith
[1:41:00] he considered not his own body now dead
[1:41:04] don't look at the circumstances that
[1:41:05] look dead around
[1:41:07] you all right come on now you got to you
[1:41:10] this faith that Abraham you know this is
[1:41:13] this is a different kind of
[1:41:14] Faith this kind of Faith doesn't look at
[1:41:17] the
[1:41:18] dead this kind of Faith sees dead rise
[1:41:23] of Faith changes everything this is
[1:41:25] listen you either believe God's word or
[1:41:27] you don't believe God's word the True
[1:41:30] Church of God believes God word listen
[1:41:33] that's why you can hear Netanyahu and
[1:41:35] and those soldiers and they will they
[1:41:37] tell you straight up we will not
[1:41:41] surrender we will annihilate the
[1:41:44] enemy we will keep our
[1:41:47] land God has given us our land and we
[1:41:50] will hold our land God has given us our
[1:41:53] our promises and we will stand upon
[1:41:55] those
[1:41:59] promises and be not weak in faith he
[1:42:02] considered not his own body now dead
[1:42:04] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:42:06] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's
[1:42:09] womb I don't care what's going
[1:42:12] on in your life you might have a child
[1:42:16] you might have something in your womb I
[1:42:19] don't care if God gets a hold of that
[1:42:22] situation what whatever the
[1:42:23] circumstances are God can change it you
[1:42:27] got a womb that won't bring forth God
[1:42:30] can bring
[1:42:31] forth because his word is is true amen
[1:42:36] if he could if he could go and take a
[1:42:38] woman at 90 years old and take that womb
[1:42:41] and and turn it and change it so that it
[1:42:43] could bring forth a living body how much
[1:42:46] more can God do it in this
[1:42:49] day Hallelujah the reality of Jesus
[1:42:52] Christ
[1:42:53] [Music]
[1:42:54] thank you Lord he staggered not at the
[1:42:57] promises Hallelujah of God through
[1:43:00] unbelief but was strong in faith giving
[1:43:03] glory to God and being fully persuaded
[1:43:06] that what he had promised he was able
[1:43:09] also to perform and therefore it was
[1:43:12] imputed to him for
[1:43:15] righteousness oh don't you listen don't
[1:43:17] you don't you get off of that word God
[1:43:21] says if you can stand there and and call
[1:43:24] those things the exact opposite of what
[1:43:27] they look like God is going to impute it
[1:43:29] unto you as righteousness and God is
[1:43:31] going to do that work God is going to
[1:43:34] restore that situation God is going to
[1:43:36] raise that dead
[1:43:39] situation Hallelujah he can still open
[1:43:42] the blinded
[1:43:43] eyes glory to God Amen listen to brother
[1:43:47] brandom here he says here in in um have
[1:43:52] faith in God 1958 he says my subject is
[1:43:56] have faith in God now we are taught in
[1:44:00] God's blessing word that Faith cometh by
[1:44:03] hearing and by hearing by the word or of
[1:44:07] the
[1:44:08] word we're preaching the word this
[1:44:11] morning you believe this word this
[1:44:13] morning if you believe it you can
[1:44:15] receive it you need a healing this
[1:44:18] morning you need a a change this morning
[1:44:21] whatever it is just believe it right now
[1:44:22] as we're as we're speaking here he says
[1:44:25] now faith is also an
[1:44:28] experience Hallelujah am and many times
[1:44:33] faith is had by a former
[1:44:36] experience and by a former experience
[1:44:39] makes Faith
[1:44:41] grow listen look back at what God did
[1:44:44] for you don't forget the things that God
[1:44:47] did for you God is still able to do
[1:44:52] exceeding abundantly more than what you
[1:44:55] can possibly imagine he can still do it
[1:44:59] amen hallelujah praise God you know you
[1:45:03] you got to reflect on those experiences
[1:45:05] from time to time oh yes so that you can
[1:45:08] you can say wait a minute he did it back
[1:45:10] there he can do it again right here
[1:45:14] hallelujah he says faith being the
[1:45:16] substance of things hoped for the
[1:45:19] evidence of things that's not seen so
[1:45:22] many people fail to find the real
[1:45:25] meaning of what faith is because they're
[1:45:27] looking for it to be
[1:45:31] seen but he says here some people
[1:45:33] believe that faith is some sensation or
[1:45:36] some emotion but the Bible said that
[1:45:40] faith is the substance of things HED
[1:45:44] for it's a reality in you and now you're
[1:45:48] just focused that God is going to
[1:45:51] manifest it amen that God's perfect will
[1:45:54] is going to be
[1:45:56] established that God knows what's best
[1:45:58] for me God knows what's best for you God
[1:46:01] knows your situation God knows exactly
[1:46:04] what you have need of right
[1:46:07] now and so 15 years later 25 years later
[1:46:12] after God made his original promise to
[1:46:15] Abraham that he would have a son Sarah
[1:46:17] gets the son 90 years old and Isaac is
[1:46:22] born
[1:46:23] soon after
[1:46:25] that you'll read about Ishmael
[1:46:30] mocking threatening
[1:46:32] Isaac Sarah
[1:46:35] again
[1:46:37] upset the division is
[1:46:41] there and cast out the bonds
[1:46:44] woman because the
[1:46:47] bondswoman shall not be
[1:46:50] air with the seed
[1:46:53] of
[1:46:55] Abraham this war that's taking place
[1:46:59] it's ugly it's
[1:47:02] terrible it's always been ugly war is
[1:47:06] never
[1:47:10] good but when it pertains to
[1:47:13] Israel it's
[1:47:16] prophecy and do you know that World War
[1:47:19] II also pertained to Israel
[1:47:24] it was a World
[1:47:26] War but yet it was millions of
[1:47:30] Jews that were slaughtered men women and
[1:47:35] children because of evil
[1:47:39] demonic spirits dominions and
[1:47:45] principalities people want to forget
[1:47:48] that we don't
[1:47:51] forget the Millions of Christians that
[1:47:53] were slaughtered throughout the Dark
[1:47:56] Ages it's always been the same fight
[1:48:00] from the
[1:48:01] beginning it started naturally right in
[1:48:05] the Garden of Eden with Cain and
[1:48:08] Abel really it started before the
[1:48:11] foundations of the world when
[1:48:14] Lucifer committed Mutiny in heaven and
[1:48:17] it fell down onto the Earth because in
[1:48:20] the mind of God he knew that he would be
[1:48:23] a
[1:48:25] savior everything that we have witnessed
[1:48:28] through scripture and through history
[1:48:31] has always been war between good and
[1:48:35] evil it's part of God's Plan of
[1:48:40] Redemption you cannot have good without
[1:48:43] the
[1:48:44] evil you cannot have Victory without the
[1:48:48] battle it's as simple as that and we
[1:48:51] need to recognize the day the hour the
[1:48:55] time and the season that we're living
[1:48:57] in we need to realize that this war is
[1:49:03] culminating and coming to a place where
[1:49:06] Israel is going to
[1:49:07] awaken Israel's win but at the same time
[1:49:11] the bride is
[1:49:14] awake she's aware let the musicians come
[1:49:17] she's aware of what God is doing in the
[1:49:21] church she's aware that God in the same
[1:49:24] way that that Israel is standing her
[1:49:28] ground fighting and not giving up this
[1:49:32] church will stand her ground will not
[1:49:35] give up will stand on the word of God
[1:49:38] will believe God's word will Proclaim
[1:49:41] that God sent a prophet in the 20th
[1:49:44] century by the name of William Branham
[1:49:47] because without that
[1:49:50] Prophet we the Gentiles
[1:49:53] would not have been restored back to
[1:49:57] this faith that we've been preaching
[1:50:00] here Malachi 4:5 was to restore the
[1:50:03] hearts of the children behold I send
[1:50:06] unto you Elijah I send unto
[1:50:09] you he didn't say to a
[1:50:12] nation he didn't say to the no Israel is
[1:50:15] going to receive their Moses and
[1:50:17] Elijah that's going to be the next
[1:50:21] stage of Moses and Elijah coming on the
[1:50:24] scene again to Israel but we're not here
[1:50:28] for
[1:50:30] that but God said I sent unto you the
[1:50:34] Christian Gentile Church Elijah the
[1:50:38] prophet to turn the hearts of the
[1:50:40] children back to the faith of the
[1:50:43] fathers back to the original
[1:50:46] faith and that's why the
[1:50:48] Reformation took place and that's why we
[1:50:52] stand
[1:50:53] and recognize who we are and at the same
[1:50:56] time can stand and see who Israel is and
[1:51:01] how important these events actually are
[1:51:04] that are taking place around
[1:51:07] us I listen Saints I could only bring
[1:51:11] what the Lord laid upon my heart but I
[1:51:14] can tell you that the signs that we've
[1:51:17] witnessed the the the the the the
[1:51:20] blackout of the Sun and and those events
[1:51:22] that took place in 2024 and all those
[1:51:25] scriptures that we brought and how the
[1:51:27] bride now is Revelations
[1:51:30] 108 thou must prophesy again we have the
[1:51:33] ministry of Prophecy upon us and we have
[1:51:37] the ability to recognize prophecy being
[1:51:39] fulfilled and that's why the five-fold
[1:51:42] ministry will will come under the
[1:51:44] anointing of the spirit of God to
[1:51:47] recognize the hour the day the events
[1:51:50] you know prophecy Vindicated prophecy
[1:51:53] being
[1:51:55] fulfilled around
[1:51:57] us we've been given that ability by the
[1:52:01] spirit of God by the Holy Ghost because
[1:52:03] when you receive the Holy Ghost you have
[1:52:05] the ability to discern the times the
[1:52:08] seasons the players those that are that
