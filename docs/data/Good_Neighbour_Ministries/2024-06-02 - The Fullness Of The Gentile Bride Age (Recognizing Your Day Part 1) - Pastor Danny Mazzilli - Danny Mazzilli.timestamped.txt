[34:24] uh he's he's absolutely in control of
[34:28] everything every
[34:30] situation um we come here this morning
[34:33] with uh a great expectation in our
[34:36] hearts I'm just as much under
[34:38] expectation as you
[34:41] are because it's never easy and
[34:44] especially just been through um you may
[34:47] be seated for a minute I'm going to just
[34:48] make a few
[34:50] comments um you know every year uh with
[34:54] the
[34:54] nurseries it's a very intense time
[34:58] throughout the month of May every year
[35:01] you think that you know by the time like
[35:04] by the time I'm now finally through the
[35:06] the the peak and the and the the real
[35:09] pressure it just comes off you know the
[35:11] pressure comes off and you feel oh I can
[35:14] do this I'm okay you know but when
[35:17] you're actually in it it's
[35:21] like you don't know if you're going to
[35:23] get through the next
[35:24] hour okay and that's how it is to be you
[35:28] know um in the front lines as a son or a
[35:31] daughter of God when you're under the
[35:34] pressure and I experience that every
[35:36] year and I think you know um I'm okay
[35:39] that I can do it and that I'll remember
[35:42] and then you get to the beginning of May
[35:46] and all of a sudden it's like everything
[35:48] is all new again and you've got to re
[35:51] you know remember so much and as you get
[35:54] older it's not easy and so by God's
[35:57] grace
[35:58] I got through another
[35:59] month and I'm here by God's
[36:03] grace you know um don't get enough sleep
[36:06] the body takes a beating like never
[36:09] before and every year it just gets
[36:10] tougher and tougher you know um but uh
[36:14] you know God's grace I can tell you I I
[36:17] feel the supernatural element of God and
[36:20] I experienced it more than ever before
[36:24] and I know why because he's placed me
[36:26] into this position amen I know that if
[36:29] God puts you into a situation or into a
[36:32] position he's also going to give you the
[36:35] faith that you need in order to fulfill
[36:39] his purpose remember our lives we can
[36:42] look at our lives and you know we can
[36:44] all look at each other's um lives and
[36:47] and look at you know how God has built
[36:49] you and designed you the work that you
[36:51] do the person and the personality that
[36:54] you are God designed you in that way for
[36:57] his purpose and we need to accept that
[37:01] realize that you know sometimes I I get
[37:04] criticized for my you know for my
[37:08] character in certain ways you know
[37:10] because God built me in a certain way
[37:12] and I can't help it right and and when
[37:15] you're in the respons when you're a
[37:17] respon you know uh the
[37:19] responsible uh person for your business
[37:22] and I've been you know I've been the
[37:24] president I've been the pilot the CEO of
[37:27] fantasy Fruit markets for over 36 years
[37:31] and and I think okay you know what I'm
[37:33] just going to you know pass this on to
[37:36] somebody else and I start going in my
[37:38] mind into certain people and I start
[37:40] thinking okay I can just pass to them or
[37:42] pass it's like giving
[37:45] somebody an
[37:47] F18 that they've never sat
[37:52] behind the instruments and say fly this
[37:56] thing yeah
[37:58] okay and I realize that because now I I
[38:01] get into that into that cockpit and I
[38:03] fly it and it seems natural the moment
[38:05] that I try to put somebody into that
[38:08] it's like it's one crash of after the
[38:12] other and and it's not easy and but I
[38:16] know that God is is going to you know
[38:19] certainly raise a standard in every
[38:22] aspect because it's just the same as God
[38:23] putting me into this position I'm scared
[38:27] to death every time I come up here
[38:29] because I I I want to know that that you
[38:33] know that the people's needs are going
[38:35] to be met I'm not up here to be a
[38:37] personality I'm not up here to to stand
[38:40] and and bring my own thoughts and my own
[38:43] ideas I realize that the supernatural
[38:46] God that called me has also called you
[38:49] amen and that together we have a purpose
[38:52] and a plan and God wants to fulfill that
[38:55] purpose and like I said all of us are
[38:58] built different we're placed into
[39:00] different areas offices and positions
[39:04] and as long as we can recognize that God
[39:06] has put us there then we can rely on him
[39:11] to bring us through to give us the faith
[39:14] to take us through to take you through
[39:16] to give you the word that you need for
[39:18] today I believe God has a word for you
[39:21] today but you have to come with that
[39:24] expectation in your hearts that you want
[39:26] to receive a word from the Lord amen
[39:29] amen praise God and so I thank you I
[39:34] know all of you were praying for me
[39:36] through the month of May I I I I felt
[39:39] your prayers I know the prayer you know
[39:42] The Prayer Ministry I would you know I
[39:44] would certainly let them know and they
[39:46] and I could feel it I could feel myself
[39:49] being strengthened when when I was
[39:51] breaking down when I felt I didn't have
[39:53] the energy anymore when I all of a
[39:55] sudden something would come over me and
[39:57] my wife would wonder and she'd say to me
[40:00] how you you're going you're going to go
[40:02] do that you I said I yes and I feel good
[40:06] right now I feel like I have the energy
[40:08] to go and do it and so I know that that
[40:11] is only because of God's grace and your
[40:14] prayers and and the fact that we are a
[40:17] body and that we have come together and
[40:20] I believe God is going to take us out of
[40:22] here together and if we join our faith
[40:25] together and we support one another
[40:27] another and respect one another's
[40:30] positions and offices we are going to
[40:32] see the supernatural take place in this
[40:35] ministry in your personal individual
[40:38] lives and in mine amen praise God so um

[49:11] um we're uh kind of we're still moving
[49:14] on you know like with with the thoughts
[49:17] that we've been bringing you know um
[49:19] over the last several months and we
[49:22] realize that that it's the Holy Spirit
[49:24] just progressing us but we're now you
[49:26] know the Lord you know laid this thought
[49:28] on me this week and it was just constant
[49:30] you know and and and what it was was the
[49:33] the he he just said the fullness of the
[49:36] Gentile bride age and that was just
[49:38] running through my mind and that was the
[49:40] thought that I started to work on and I
[49:42] started to search and research and read
[49:45] and and and listen to the messages and
[49:48] so forth and and I believe that you know
[49:51] that it's all still in the same line and
[49:54] the thought that we've been you know
[49:56] bringing it's recognizing your day it's
[49:59] all about recognizing your day it's
[50:01] about recognizing Christ in the present
[50:04] stage of his ministry amen so let's go
[50:07] to the first
[50:09] scripture praise
[50:12] God Luke
[50:14] 21: 24- 28 and they shall fall by the
[50:18] edge of the sword and shall be led away
[50:21] captive into all nations and Jerusalem
[50:24] shall be trotten down of the Gentiles
[50:27] until the times of the Gentiles be
[50:31] fulfilled and there shall be signs in
[50:34] the Sun and in the moon and in the stars
[50:37] and upon the Earth distress of nations
[50:40] with perplexity the Sea and the waves
[50:45] roaring father we ask your blessing upon
[50:47] the word may you take control now in
[50:50] Jesus name amen praise God you may be
[50:54] seated you know um
[50:57] just in in reading this scripture here
[50:59] you know like uh back on April the 28th
[51:02] you know we ministered on signs in the
[51:04] heavens and you know signs of the times
[51:07] and you know um you know I know there
[51:10] was probably a little bit of rumbling
[51:12] that may have gone forth as a result of
[51:15] of bringing that message you know uh
[51:17] because there was you know pictures and
[51:19] you know there was a picture of of of a
[51:21] cloud that that I brought that the Lord
[51:23] you know spoke to me through and you
[51:26] know these are these are signs and
[51:28] wonders that God is doing in this day
[51:31] and people might say oh what brother
[51:33] Danny or trying to make himself
[51:35] something or or or show something that
[51:37] you know uh that's that's uh you know
[51:40] aside from no no no no absolutely not
[51:44] these are things we need to recognize
[51:47] that that the message of the hour is in
[51:51] each and every one of us and God is
[51:54] still speaking personally
[51:57] to each and every one of us amen God has
[52:00] placed me into this position as the
[52:03] pastor of this church I am not
[52:05] responsible for other churches I am
[52:08] responsible for what God lays upon my
[52:11] heart to bring into this local church
[52:15] and to anybody that would hear it they
[52:18] have a choice to accept it or question
[52:21] it or whatever that's not my
[52:24] concern these are things things that
[52:27] that God laid upon my heart to bring to
[52:30] you I when I look back and I realized
[52:33] you know all that that was uh you know
[52:35] in that message on April the 28th I look
[52:38] back on that I came to realize that I
[52:41] could have never put that
[52:43] together I couldn't have put the timing
[52:45] of all those things together I realized
[52:48] that it was the spirit of God that was
[52:50] interceding and doing something that was
[52:53] making himself his life
[52:57] his life his present stage what he's
[53:01] doing in the body of Jesus Christ this
[53:04] is our local body amen this is where God
[53:07] is speaking to us this is where God is
[53:10] perfecting each and every one of our
[53:13] faith and this is where God has placed
[53:15] you under this ministry if God spoke to
[53:20] you through that message then then
[53:23] praise God receive from it I received
[53:26] message mesages from people in
[53:29] Florida that were immensely blessed and
[53:32] were fellowshipping people message
[53:34] people that they said oh praise God you
[53:38] know God is he's still the same God he's
[53:40] still the same yesterday today and
[53:43] forever we know that the cloud that came
[53:45] down in 1963 had a supernatural
[53:48] existence and and and and purpose and
[53:52] and reason and and we're the we're we're
[53:54] the manifestation of that
[53:57] we are the living manifestation of that
[53:59] cloud but he's still the same yesterday
[54:03] today and forever amen he still can make
[54:07] himself known he could walk into here
[54:10] the pillar of fire could come right into
[54:12] this room and hover right over that
[54:14] scripture if you wanted to and make it
[54:16] totally fully visible to each and every
[54:19] one of us God can do something with an
[54:23] individual that's standing right next to
[54:25] me but because it was not for me and it
[54:28] was for him he receives what God wants
[54:33] to give to him in other words it's not
[54:36] for
[54:38] everybody but it's For Those whom God
[54:41] has chosen to reveal himself in the
[54:44] Simplicity of his word of his word and
[54:48] the Simplicity of speaking to you by
[54:51] Revelation amen what you have need of
[54:54] Amen praise that was just a side note as
[54:55] I read this
[54:56] I
[54:58] said praise God let the Lord have his
[55:00] way amen let's go to the next
[55:04] scripture acts 13:46 to 49 then Paul and
[55:08] Barnabas waxed bold and said it was
[55:12] necessary that the word of God should
[55:14] first have been spoken to you now here
[55:17] he's talking about he's speaking to the
[55:19] Jews he's speaking to to to Israel there
[55:23] okay but seeing ye put it from you and
[55:26] judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting
[55:30] life Lo we turn to the
[55:33] Gentiles well you know that's all about
[55:36] recognizing your day and its message
[55:38] amen that's all that you know
[55:40] recognizing what God is doing in your
[55:42] day recognizing the signs in the heavens
[55:45] recognizing the signs with what's going
[55:48] on with Israel right now recognizing the
[55:50] war that's taking place recognizing how
[55:53] all the Gentile nations are starting to
[55:56] come against Israel how this is all
[56:00] coming together you you need to
[56:02] recognize that this is prophecy this is
[56:05] Vindicated prophecy these are things
[56:08] that are being Vindicated by the word of
[56:11] God for this day and for this hour amen
[56:13] praise God but but for for so hath the
[56:17] Lord commanded us saying I have set thee
[56:20] to be a light of the
[56:22] Gentiles that thou should us be for
[56:25] salvation unto the ends of the Earth and
[56:29] when the Gentiles heard this they were
[56:33] glad and glorified the word of the Lord
[56:37] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[56:39] life believed and the word of the Lord
[56:42] was published throughout all the
[56:46] region hallelujah praise God I believe
[56:50] God's got a people right now on earth
[56:53] that is publicizing that the the word
[56:56] for this day and for this hour that God
[56:59] is still calling God is still perfecting
[57:03] I don't know if that Gentile age is over
[57:07] it just might be it could very well be
[57:11] but there's some that still need a
[57:13] little
[57:14] perfecting there's still some that need
[57:17] some Perfection let's go and read this
[57:19] um next
[57:22] scripture for I would not brethren
[57:26] that ye should be ignorant of this
[57:28] mystery lest ye should be wise in your
[57:32] own conceits that blindness in part is
[57:36] happened to
[57:37] Israel until the
[57:39] fullness of the
[57:41] Gentiles become
[57:43] in and so here we are now we're in a
[57:47] time and in a season where you know
[57:51] Israel is in a condition that it's never
[57:54] been before
[57:56] I believe it's on the Brinks of a
[57:59] supernatural
[58:00] Awakening I believe it's it's uh it's
[58:03] it's a time in a season right now where
[58:05] the Gentiles are coming into into
[58:09] especially the Gentile Bride for this
[58:13] age she's coming into her fullness and
[58:17] when she comes into her fullness then
[58:20] Israel's got to come into their
[58:22] Awakening Israel has to come into their
[58:24] full awake I I believe they're
[58:27] experiencing the strength the
[58:29] supernatural inspiration that God is
[58:31] giving them to press the battle just
[58:34] like us we've been pressing the battle
[58:37] we've been overcoming the the enemy he's
[58:39] been he's been fighting us left right
[58:41] and Center in this message and you're
[58:44] going to feel it more than ever before
[58:47] you're going to feel the pressure of
[58:49] people not wanting to accept you your
[58:53] message what it is that you stand for
[58:56] which is the word of God it's Christ in
[58:58] the present stage of his ministry
[59:00] they're going to reject that they're not
[59:02] going to be able to receive it they're
[59:04] going to say well what you're better
[59:05] than us no we're not better than anybody
[59:08] Jesus when he was on the earth and those
[59:11] disciples receive the word of the Lord
[59:13] they were rejected by the majority of
[59:15] the people am they couldn't help seeing
[59:18] what they saw they couldn't help seeing
[59:20] that this is the
[59:22] Messiah this is the word made flesh this
[59:25] is the word in our day this is what this
[59:28] is what the prophet said was going to
[59:29] happen and here it is but yet they
[59:33] Israel and and all of the high priest
[59:34] they were blind well there's a there's a
[59:38] darkness that is over the land right now
[59:40] like never before I believe back in
[59:44] April when that Eclipse took place and
[59:46] and and and total darkness came into
[59:50] America once again it was God
[59:52] vindicating and showing that this this
[59:55] nation that that the Gentile Nations
[59:58] have gone into total darkness I believe
[1:00:01] there's there's there's absolute
[1:00:03] Darkness that's come over the people and
[1:00:06] now the the the the the the nation of
[1:00:08] Israel under great bombardment is
[1:00:11] feeling the pressure of of the Gentile
[1:00:15] Darkness because when darkness will
[1:00:17] listen when you Corner a rat when you
[1:00:21] Corner somebody when you Corner
[1:00:23] something that's evil they get vicious

[1:00:33] destroy and and and the whole system is
[1:00:36] being designed in such a way that with
[1:00:38] this gross Darkness that's coming upon

[1:00:43] they're they want their rights they

[1:00:47] control and now they're looking at
[1:00:49] everything in a in a combined way

[1:02:07] that they want a Great Awakening they're
[1:02:10] crying believing that there will be an
[1:02:13] Awakening they're good people why is it
[1:02:16] why have they done they have not
[1:02:20] recognize the Awakening of the
[1:02:23] Bride The Awakening of of the church the
[1:02:28] bride is Christ in female form in this
[1:02:33] last
[1:02:34] age glory to God they haven't recognized
[1:02:37] see by being a Christian they feel the
[1:02:40] pull of the hour but they haven't
[1:02:42] recognized what's being done that's
[1:02:45] what's making them feel that way they
[1:02:47] know something is supposed to happen but
[1:02:50] see they're looking for it off in the
[1:02:53] future to come when it's already
[1:02:56] happened right by you and this is the
[1:03:01] condition of the church world out there
[1:03:05] and and we with the light of this hour
[1:03:08] with the word for this day and for this
[1:03:11] hour we're out there expressing and
[1:03:15] saying you need to recognize Jesus
[1:03:17] Christ today you need to know that that
[1:03:21] that his word is real now and your
[1:03:26] tradition and your teaching and your
[1:03:28] understanding of God's word is based on
[1:03:31] tradition just like the Pharisees back
[1:03:34] in the days when Jesus was on the earth
[1:03:38] here the word stood right in front of
[1:03:40] them the word was made flesh and yet
[1:03:43] they all they wanted to do was go back
[1:03:45] to their tradition go back to what they
[1:03:48] were taught what they interpreted how
[1:03:51] they interpreted the word they couldn't
[1:03:54] see that the word was actually being
[1:03:57] interpreted in their day so that they
[1:04:00] could recognize the hour that they were
[1:04:02] living in praise God and
[1:04:07] so um we see now
[1:04:11] here
[1:04:13] uh in in the
[1:04:16] message
[1:04:17] recognizing your
[1:04:20] day the Gentile church for this
[1:04:24] hour must come in into a mature full
[1:04:28] revelation of who she is you need to
[1:04:32] come into the fullness of the word for
[1:04:35] your day your position because as you do
[1:04:40] that you correlate exactly with what's
[1:04:43] going on in the world with
[1:04:47] Israel as we become more mature as we
[1:04:51] become more uh um aware of who we are
[1:04:55] are and take our positions in
[1:04:59] Christ everything out there that's going
[1:05:02] on starts to make more sense everything
[1:05:06] starts to correlate between the two and
[1:05:10] so you represent Christ and the Gentile
[1:05:15] Bride for this age and you must come
[1:05:19] into your
[1:05:20] fullness how that happens is by feasting
[1:05:24] on the word of God
[1:05:26] by gathering around where the carcass is
[1:05:30] where the fresh Mana is being preached
[1:05:34] not tradition not by just uh you know
[1:05:37] play and Obey just go to the tapes you
[1:05:40] all you got to do is listen to the tapes
[1:05:42] no you need to listen to the tapes and
[1:05:44] you need to feed on the present stage of
[1:05:46] Jesus Christ in Bride form bringing the
[1:05:50] word of God through a five-fold Ministry
[1:05:53] you need to be in the presence of the
[1:05:55] living Living God where you meet God
[1:05:57] face to face where you have experience
[1:06:00] face to face with God on a daily basis
[1:06:04] hallelujah praise God you know when you
[1:06:08] take a look at Israel and you look at
[1:06:10] the current
[1:06:12] situation you you see that America is
[1:06:15] backing Israel all right now the Arab
[1:06:19] states are friendly with Israel okay
[1:06:23] because there the Arab states are also
[1:06:25] like Egypt and all of them they're
[1:06:27] they're also uh being friendly in that
[1:06:30] they are you know um kind of supporting
[1:06:34] in in in a in a indirect way though they
[1:06:38] are muslim okay they're supporting in an
[1:06:40] indirect way uh what's going on because
[1:06:43] they need the protection of the
[1:06:47] Americans okay just like uh
[1:06:51] uh those Arab states and Iran they hate
[1:06:55] one another
[1:06:56] they're not they're they're they're
[1:06:58] they're the same in in that they they
[1:07:00] both uh you know worship Allah but they
[1:07:02] have their
[1:07:03] differences and their differences cause
[1:07:06] it's just like a lot of religions out
[1:07:08] there even Christian and different
[1:07:10] Protestant churches and you know Jehovah
[1:07:12] Witness and this and that you you you
[1:07:14] know you meet some of the people and you
[1:07:16] can sense the that they don't like you
[1:07:19] they hate you you know there's a there's
[1:07:21] you know even though you you might you
[1:07:23] might have the same religion and you
[1:07:25] might you know both say Jesus Christ but
[1:07:28] one makes Jesus Christ another God one
[1:07:31] in three gods and you're recognizing
[1:07:34] that that it is God right and and so
[1:07:37] there's a difference there and that
[1:07:38] difference brings a hatred right but
[1:07:41] what's important for us to understand is
[1:07:43] that the enemy the enemy is looking to
[1:07:47] destroy Israel regardless of whatever
[1:07:52] the differences are in what might be
[1:07:54] appear Hamas the hoodies all these
[1:07:57] different terrorist organizations they
[1:08:00] all have one purpose and that is to
[1:08:03] destroy Israel and the enemy the devil
[1:08:07] that's fighting us through all these
[1:08:09] different Avenues of of you know whether
[1:08:13] it's New Age movement whether it's you
[1:08:15] know teachings of higher levels of
[1:08:17] consciousness and making yourself you
[1:08:20] know a part of the universe and you
[1:08:22] don't need Jesus Christ these are all
[1:08:24] avenues that are trying distract us from
[1:08:27] the word of God Amen and people are
[1:08:29] being distracted by it in the world
[1:08:32] today they're being distracted to be
[1:08:35] looking at all the wrong things so that
[1:08:38] they don't look to the word of God but
[1:08:40] you're the only one that just brings
[1:08:42] them back to the word but wait a minute
[1:08:44] how were you baptized I was baptized in
[1:08:46] the name of the father and the Son and
[1:08:48] the Holy Spirit when I was 6 months old
[1:08:51] I said but that's not what the scripture
[1:08:53] says but that doesn't matter
[1:08:56] matter my parents did it and that's how
[1:08:59] they did it and that's how they teach it
[1:09:02] so that's good enough for me Well when
[1:09:06] things really hit the fan and they're
[1:09:08] starting to really come and hit the fan
[1:09:10] you're going to realize that your
[1:09:12] tradition was not going to be enough to
[1:09:15] get you out of the mess that this world
[1:09:17] is going
[1:09:18] into it's going into Great Tribulation
[1:09:21] and without the spirit of God which can
[1:09:23] only be received by obeying the word of
[1:09:27] God by coming God's provided way which
[1:09:31] is repent as an adult recognizing that
[1:09:34] you're a sinner and being baptized in
[1:09:38] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:09:40] the remission of your sin that's God's
[1:09:43] mercy in your life just a gift of God to
[1:09:46] wash you from your sin then you are then
[1:09:50] you are
[1:09:51] uh open to receive the gift of the Holy
[1:09:55] Ghost
[1:09:56] and it's the spirit of God that's going
[1:09:58] to Quicken you and give you salvation
[1:10:02] you don't get salvation any other way
[1:10:04] than by the spirit of God there is no
[1:10:07] other name whereby man must be saved by
[1:10:11] but by the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:10:15] it's as simple as that and so we need to
[1:10:18] realize that all of this that's going on
[1:10:22] is all the spirit of iniquity
[1:10:26] it says in in in 2 Thessalonians for the
[1:10:29] mystery of iniquity doth already work
[1:10:31] only he who now leth will let until he
[1:10:35] be taken out of the way to let means to
[1:10:38] prevent God's only lets the devil do a
[1:10:41] certain amount of damage and a certain
[1:10:44] amount of of uh of uh you know
[1:10:47] interference in your life but let me
[1:10:50] tell you when God wants to give you a
[1:10:51] revelation and set you free it's done
[1:10:55] amen there's the Gates of Hell will not
[1:10:59] Prevail against what God can do in
[1:11:02] delivering you and setting you free uh
[1:11:06] breaking the chains of tradition
[1:11:08] breaking the chains of drug abuse
[1:11:11] breaking the chains of pornography
[1:11:13] breaking the chains of of uh uh uh re
[1:11:17] Rebellion breaking the chains of of of
[1:11:20] mental illness something that is taking
[1:11:24] control of the people Minds like never
[1:11:26] before trying to possess the minds of
[1:11:29] the people giving them saying it's okay
[1:11:32] you have a a form of mental illness so
[1:11:36] you just need to get some
[1:11:38] psychology yeah you do need some
[1:11:40] psychology you need some neology you
[1:11:42] need some theology in the word of God
[1:11:45] you need Jesus Christ who is the savior
[1:11:47] and the Redeemer now don't get me wrong
[1:11:49] I don't want to people to say oh you're
[1:11:52] you're you're bashing the the
[1:11:53] psychologist no they're needed more than
[1:11:55] ever right now otherwise it's total
[1:11:58] chaos out there but you have a
[1:12:02] choice you have a choice you can come to
[1:12:05] Jesus Christ you can come to the word of
[1:12:08] God you can come to the supernatural
[1:12:11] deliverer I am a witness of that there
[1:12:13] are many witnesses that are in this
[1:12:15] place that are out there that can that
[1:12:18] can that can stand and say he delivered
[1:12:21] me am he set me free amen he took away
[1:12:27] that addiction He restored my family He
[1:12:30] restored my relationship because it
[1:12:33] takes three to make a real solid
[1:12:36] marriage it takes the man the woman and
[1:12:38] you need to invite the Lord into your
[1:12:41] life so that he can Bond it with his
[1:12:44] love amen praise God there's no other
[1:12:47] way that you can have total peace and
[1:12:50] total Deliverance in this world they're
[1:12:53] looking for every possible Avenue and
[1:12:56] they're thinking that because they can
[1:12:58] go to the psychologist on a weekly basis
[1:13:00] they're going to get their fixed that's
[1:13:02] no different than just taking a Tylenol
[1:13:05] for a headache the headache comes back
[1:13:08] again and you got to take the Tylenol
[1:13:11] again and so you know it's it's more
[1:13:14] like I would rather get total
[1:13:17] Deliverance
[1:13:18] amen I believe in a
[1:13:21] God that said I am the Lord God that
[1:13:24] Health all all your
[1:13:26] diseases and when he heals it's
[1:13:30] done it might take longer than you want
[1:13:33] it to take it might be embarrassing for
[1:13:36] a while because of the situation but you
[1:13:40] stand on the word of God and you stay
[1:13:43] there until God proves his word you're
[1:13:46] not proving his word God is proving his
[1:13:49] word in you you're not getting the glory
[1:13:51] god gets the glory when he heals you
[1:13:53] when he delivers you when he set you
[1:13:55] free that's what we're looking for amen
[1:13:59] but this Spirit of iniquity is working
[1:14:02] in the land and it makes people feel
[1:14:05] Justified well I can do this I can go
[1:14:07] there I can I don't need to go to

[1:14:23] worship not people that go go to church
[1:14:25] and fall
[1:14:27] asleep people that go to church and
[1:14:30] worship and praise God and say Amen
[1:14:34] praise God I believe it I receive it

[1:15:37] in that kind of situation and I tell
[1:15:38] them straight up I said you want to you
[1:15:41] want to be delivered from that and it
[1:15:43] happened somebody came into this church
[1:15:46] years ago after a mother called me and
[1:15:49] said Danny you know I remember your
[1:15:51] testimony when we had dinner with your
[1:15:52] wife and I got a son that you know
[1:15:55] that's that's hook to cocaine would you
[1:15:58] talk to him I said of course but will he
[1:16:01] talk to me she says well we're going to
[1:16:03] try to set it up and we're going to try
[1:16:05] to make it happen I said okay well just
[1:16:07] let me know and she called me about a
[1:16:09] month later and she says okay can you
[1:16:10] come over at 5:30 he's going to be
[1:16:12] coming over and you can talk to him I
[1:16:14] said sure my wife and I went
[1:16:16] over he didn't show there was a phone
[1:16:20] call and she's there and she's trying to
[1:16:22] why aren't you here I said leave him
[1:16:24] alone
[1:16:25] I said when the time comes if it's meant
[1:16:28] to happen he'll come just the fact that
[1:16:31] you have you know in my mind I said just
[1:16:33] the fact that you have poured out and
[1:16:36] you have reached out because something
[1:16:38] in you was revealed in your heart that
[1:16:41] that's a reality what happened to that
[1:16:44] man and so it was a few months later I
[1:16:48] got a call and she says he's
[1:16:50] ready he wants to see you I said all
[1:16:54] right
[1:16:55] I'm coming and we went there and just
[1:16:58] like nothing I didn't get into oh Jesus
[1:17:01] going to deliver
[1:17:06] you that's not that's not Christianity
[1:17:09] no no Jesus walked into the house and he
[1:17:14] seen that the the girl was dead he said
[1:17:17] everybody
[1:17:19] out says don't need any unbelief
[1:17:22] here and he just went and laid hands on
[1:17:24] that girl
[1:17:25] and breathed the breath of life back
[1:17:27] into her and walked
[1:17:30] out I stood there and I said how you
[1:17:33] doing we talked for a while we got into
[1:17:36] discussion and then I started to give my
[1:17:38] testimony on how God did this and then I
[1:17:41] started naming certain things and he was
[1:17:42] going wait a minute I'm 33 years old you
[1:17:47] were 33 when God delivered you I said
[1:17:49] yeah he says
[1:17:51] oh and then he says wait a minute I'm
[1:17:55] my wife's name's Jennifer your wife's
[1:17:57] name is
[1:17:58] Jennifer I said
[1:18:02] yeah I said come to the house of the
[1:18:05] Lord and he came here and he received
[1:18:09] the
[1:18:11] word of faith for his Deliverance he got
[1:18:15] baptized and up until last week he's
[1:18:17] still out on the streets preaching Jesus
[1:18:20] Christ amen that's his ministry
[1:18:26] God delivered him supernaturally to that
[1:18:28] he'd never look back to that drug that I
[1:18:31] know of and he's out there and he was at
[1:18:33] our garden center there a couple weeks
[1:18:35] ago I was talking to myself brother Tim
[1:18:37] to you know showing us how he's reaching
[1:18:39] the people on the street and how he
[1:18:41] shows them about the cross and how he
[1:18:43] brings them to Jesus and how he gets
[1:18:45] people right there and prays for them on
[1:18:47] the street and screaming and yelling and
[1:18:49] praising God I said fantastic I said God
[1:18:54] bless you God bless your ministry that's
[1:18:57] what God has placed on your heart
[1:18:58] continue to do it amen what are you
[1:19:00] going to do thank you Jesus that's what
[1:19:03] God revealed to him and so when when
[1:19:07] when the supernatural comes on the scene
[1:19:10] and does these kinds of things you don't
[1:19:13] have to worry God is going to prove and
[1:19:16] vindicate his own word you don't have to
[1:19:19] prove anything Hallelujah glory to God
[1:19:23] and so you know we read here in
[1:19:27] Romans 11:
[1:19:29] 25 and we're just going to go back now
[1:19:31] to our thought for I for I would not
[1:19:35] Brethren that ye should be ignorant of
[1:19:37] this mystery lest ye should be wise in
[1:19:39] your own conceits the blindness in part
[1:19:43] is happened to Israel until the fullness
[1:19:46] of the Gentiles become in and so here
[1:19:49] now God is bringing a bride to maturity
[1:19:53] we are looking around
[1:19:55] the condition of the world it's never
[1:19:57] been in the condition that it's in God
[1:19:59] is starting to do a mighty work right
[1:20:02] here in the midst and he's bringing a
[1:20:04] bride into full maturity so that she can
[1:20:08] be uh you know so that she can recognize
[1:20:11] listen to brother Brandon and
[1:20:12] recognizing your day he says you know
[1:20:14] the Jews were blinded for the very
[1:20:16] purpose that we could have
[1:20:18] sight you know God God's purpose in
[1:20:21] blinding Israel was to call his Gentile
[1:20:24] bride
[1:20:25] amen they were torn apart they were
[1:20:27] scattered as a nation and rejected their
[1:20:31] Messiah uh that that we might receive
[1:20:34] the Messiah that there might be a people
[1:20:36] called out of the Gentiles for his
[1:20:39] name's sake that's why we we receive the
[1:20:43] name of Jesus Christ we baptize in the
[1:20:45] name of Jesus Christ we pray in the name
[1:20:48] of Jesus Christ because he is our
[1:20:49] husband we have taken his name amen now
[1:20:53] the man comes forth and the woman takes
[1:20:55] his name there it is these blinded
[1:20:58] Gentiles who can't see that name the
[1:21:01] Lord Jesus Christ in baptism it's just
[1:21:04] too bad but it has to be that way the
[1:21:07] Jews they had to they had to not see
[1:21:10] that there is only one can see it that's
[1:21:14] the one who is predestinated to see
[1:21:17] it you're you're blessed this morning
[1:21:20] God has given you eyes to see amen
[1:21:23] praise God they the only ones that have
[1:21:26] been that have been uh given to see it
[1:21:28] amen the Jews otherwise you'll never see
[1:21:31] it the Jews could not uh could not uh
[1:21:35] see that being their Messiah and yet
[1:21:38] they were Scholars and theologians Men
[1:21:41] of great renowned scholarship read the
[1:21:44] same Bible that you read now after it's
[1:21:48] been made known to us we can see it
[1:21:50] plain that was Messiah but they couldn't
[1:21:54] see it neither can they see it
[1:21:57] today they are prophesied to be blinded
[1:22:01] too the church this day is prophesied to
[1:22:05] be blinded to reject the evening time
[1:22:09] message Revelation said so Thou Art
[1:22:13] wretched miserable notice the bride's
[1:22:16] condition the other night or the church
[1:22:19] naked blind and don't know it Lord Jesus
[1:22:24] be Merc merciful to us the Bible said
[1:22:26] she was naked I never saw it till just
[1:22:30] now Leo Dean church was naked and when
[1:22:33] she appeared the other night she was
[1:22:36] naked never noticed it and didn't know
[1:22:38] it oh how thankful how no wonder we are
[1:22:42] so grateful I feel that that we're not
[1:22:46] grateful enough for the things that God
[1:22:49] is making known to us naked and the
[1:22:53] vision said told me she was naked and
[1:22:56] she didn't know it and blinded as Israel
[1:22:59] was blinded so that the Gentiles could
[1:23:03] come in now the Gentiles are blinded so
[1:23:06] the bride can be taken out and Israel
[1:23:10] can receive the Feast of the trumpets
[1:23:13] just perfectly after two days he will
[1:23:17] revive us or give us a Revival bringing
[1:23:21] us together the Jews speaking on these
[1:23:24] trumpets now and he shall and we shall
[1:23:27] live in his sight or have eternal life
[1:23:30] see we'll be in his sight the Bible said
[1:23:34] here in Hosea said and we shall live in
[1:23:37] his sight life have life in his sight
[1:23:41] that's his own life eternal life have
[1:23:45] life in his sight she that lives in
[1:23:48] pleasure is dead while she's alive so we
[1:23:52] promis that Israel again would have life
[1:23:56] in his sight she's been dead to the
[1:23:59] facts and to the Pentecostal Feast so
[1:24:02] Israel since Pentecost has been blinded
[1:24:06] to see the Messiah to recognize the word
[1:24:09] for this day and for this hour but
[1:24:12] listen God has preserved a remnant of
[1:24:15] Israel did you know
[1:24:17] that Israel is going to be awakened
[1:24:21] Israel is coming into such a a fullness
[1:24:24] of pressure and and and the Dynamics
[1:24:28] that are now starting to come together
[1:24:30] worldwide with the Gentile Nations and
[1:24:33] and and all of the the enemies of Israel
[1:24:37] it's putting such a pressure on them
[1:24:39] that it's going to bring out the time
[1:24:41] and the season that Israel goes into her
[1:24:45] Spiritual Awakening but guess what
[1:24:47] happens before that the Rapture the
[1:24:51] bride she comes into her full Awakening
[1:24:54] but listen here look it God's preserved
[1:24:58] a remnant of Israel for three reasons
[1:25:01] we're just going to look at them briefly
[1:25:02] here number one to glorify his
[1:25:06] sovereignty God is Sovereign and last
[1:25:11] you know and and he said here in in
[1:25:13] Romans 11:25-26 lest you be wise in your
[1:25:16] own sight you know we as Gentiles we're
[1:25:19] seeing all of this that's going on but
[1:25:22] let's not get lifted up thinking that
[1:25:24] we're anything that just because we
[1:25:26] recognize and we see and we know that
[1:25:29] our eyes have been opened because you
[1:25:32] know what darkness is coming upon the
[1:25:35] Gentiles now gross darkness is coming
[1:25:38] upon all the Gentile churches a lot of
[1:25:40] them are saying oh yes this is prophecy
[1:25:43] you know Israel is supposed to come
[1:25:45] under this pressure and and it's because
[1:25:48] we the Gentiles are coming into our
[1:25:50] fullness and the Gentile dispensation is
[1:25:52] going to be over and we're going to go
[1:25:54] into a
[1:25:55] Rapture they have that General you can
[1:25:58] go on YouTube and you can listen to a
[1:26:00] lot of these teachings but then you
[1:26:02] listen closely and they're trinitarian
[1:26:05] they believe in Jesus Christ the son the
[1:26:08] Holy Spirit as another entity and then
[1:26:10] the father as another entity and so they
[1:26:14] they are off the word and though they
[1:26:17] believe that they're with the word and
[1:26:19] they believe that they're going to see
[1:26:21] The Rapture they believe that that you
[1:26:23] know that that part of the prophecy they
[1:26:25] don't realize that they're actually
[1:26:27] under blindness that there's a gross
[1:26:31] Darkness that's come upon the Gentiles
[1:26:34] Romans
[1:26:35] 11:25 so the you know uh I do not want
[1:26:39] you to be unaware of this mystery
[1:26:41] Brothers a
[1:26:42] partial blinding has come upon Israel
[1:26:47] until the fullness of the Gentiles has
[1:26:49] come in so here we are now we're coming
[1:26:52] into our maturity
[1:26:55] this bride needs to recognize who she is
[1:26:58] she needs to realize that she's in a in
[1:27:01] in the Gentile bride age now we're not
[1:27:05] under the message uh you know the
[1:27:09] message age that that that all the
[1:27:11] message churches are proclaiming out
[1:27:14] there and oh you just got to listen to
[1:27:15] the tapes you know if you don't listen
[1:27:17] to the tapes you're lost all of those
[1:27:19] things no God is calling out a people
[1:27:22] out listen listen we're in the bride age
[1:27:25] listen to these quotes
[1:27:27] here God is calling out now watch from
[1:27:30] the from the Rapture message now we find
[1:27:32] here that Enoch was the seventh from
[1:27:34] Noah which was a type of the church age
[1:27:37] now all of the rest of the six men
[1:27:39] before him died but Enoch was
[1:27:42] translated Enoch was raptured the
[1:27:45] seventh showing that it's the seventh
[1:27:47] Church age that takes the Rapture though
[1:27:50] we are still under the leodan seventh
[1:27:54] Church age Naturally Speaking okay but
[1:27:59] spiritually speaking listen now he goes
[1:28:01] on here now the seventh Church age
[1:28:03] that's that's takes the Rapture all of
[1:28:07] the other six died but Noah was
[1:28:08] translated because he was not found God
[1:28:11] took him but Enoch raptured was a type
[1:28:15] of all of the rest of them dying but the
[1:28:19] end time bride will be called out of
[1:28:24] so in this seventh Church age there is a
[1:28:28] bride that's being called out of it
[1:28:32] there's a lot of them that are still in
[1:28:34] it they're still living in it they're
[1:28:37] still living under the seventh Church
[1:28:38] age messenger not realizing what when
[1:28:41] the seventh Church age messenger went
[1:28:44] off the scene the mighty Angel himself
[1:28:47] came down in
[1:28:49] 1963 and I had to decrease so that he
[1:28:52] could increase brother brand said and
[1:28:55] the Bible became a whole new Bible
[1:28:58] because the Bible now was to be opened
[1:29:01] to the bride age to the elected for that
[1:29:05] age that was going to be called out of
[1:29:08] the seventh Church
[1:29:10] age why didn't the Rapture go under the
[1:29:13] messenger of Malachi
[1:29:15] 4:5 because the Rapture doesn't go out
[1:29:18] under the me under under Malachi 45 the
[1:29:22] messenger the man it RS out under the
[1:29:25] supernatural anointing of the mighty
[1:29:28] Angel himself coming down speaking to us
[1:29:32] right here from this Pulpit from other
[1:29:34] pulpits that are anointed by the word
[1:29:36] for this hour that have recognized that
[1:29:38] Jesus Christ is now in bright form
[1:29:41] speaking the word calling the
[1:29:43] resurrection calling her to her position
[1:29:46] to recognize come up hither it's time to
[1:29:50] receive your change amen you got to
[1:29:53] recognize the dispensational changes
[1:29:55] that are taking place and if you don't
[1:29:58] see that we've come out of the mess
[1:30:02] age because it's a big mess right
[1:30:05] now you got all kinds of different
[1:30:07] personalities and all kinds of
[1:30:09] interpretations on the word of God it is
[1:30:12] never to be privately
[1:30:14] interpreted the word of God God is his
[1:30:16] own interpreter he will make it plain
[1:30:19] God will vindicate one day one morning
[1:30:22] sometime by 9:00 in the morning sometime
[1:30:24] around then we're going to be changed
[1:30:26] and we're not going to show up for work
[1:30:28] that day and your family members are
[1:30:30] going to be looking for you and they're
[1:30:32] going to wonder wait a minute here what
[1:30:34] happened yes what happened was
[1:30:36] everything that we said was going to
[1:30:38] happen that Jesus Christ in the present
[1:30:40] stage of his ministry he would take a
[1:30:43] people he would he would supernaturally
[1:30:45] change their lives pull them out of sin
[1:30:48] and unbelief pull them out of their
[1:30:50] doctrinal teachings pull them out of
[1:30:52] their out of their tradition
[1:30:54] pull them out of their father's
[1:30:56] teachings and their priest's teachings
[1:30:58] and their teachers teachings and their
[1:31:00] new age teachings and bring them into
[1:31:03] the mystical body of Jesus Christ in
[1:31:06] this day thank you Jesus look what he
[1:31:09] says here he says there's going to be he
[1:31:12] says in the first seal then Along come
[1:31:15] the Pentecostal age with the baptism of
[1:31:18] the Holy Spirit and they cabbaged down
[1:31:21] on that now there cannot be no more ages
[1:31:25] that's all of it that's the Philadelphia
[1:31:28] or not the leod Dean age but then we
[1:31:31] found in the studying of the
[1:31:33] scriptures that the messenger to the age
[1:31:36] come right at the end of every age at
[1:31:41] end of the age every
[1:31:45] time so when brother Brenham came to the
[1:31:48] end of his
[1:31:50] ministry in 1965
[1:31:54] between 1963 and
[1:31:56] 1965 that age was
[1:31:59] ending the age was coming to an end of
[1:32:03] the of the of the of the the man
[1:32:05] messenger man age but it was moving into
[1:32:08] the son of man a continuation of the son
[1:32:10] of man Ministry which was The Headstone
[1:32:13] coming down to meet with the
[1:32:15] bodyall and that has to be recognized as
[1:32:18] the supernatural element and the time
[1:32:21] and the season that we're in right now
[1:32:23] which is the bride age the body of Jesus
[1:32:27] Christ so here now he says now he says
[1:32:31] that's all of it we found in the
[1:32:33] studying of the scriptures Paul come at
[1:32:35] the End of the Age we find out that
[1:32:37] ireneus come at the end of of the age
[1:32:40] Martin End of the Age Luther end of the
[1:32:42] Catholic Age and what Wesley at the end
[1:32:45] of the Lutheran age and Pentecost at the
[1:32:47] End of the Age of sanctification through
[1:32:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother
[1:32:52] brandham was the messenger Messenger to
[1:32:54] the Pentecostal Church
[1:32:56] age amen praise God but then the mighty
[1:33:00] Angel himself comes on the scene to
[1:33:02] progress and take us into the bride age
[1:33:05] which is the rapture age which is the
[1:33:07] body change age which is the fullness of
[1:33:10] the Gentile bride age which is going to
[1:33:13] bring the Perfection to Israel so that
[1:33:17] she can be lifted out of her
[1:33:19] blindness everything is weighing one
[1:33:22] with the other everything is is in God's
[1:33:25] perfect timing we want to put a timing
[1:33:28] on it we want to interpret it but God is
[1:33:30] interpreting it right here right before
[1:33:32] our very eyes we've never been in this
[1:33:35] situation where Israel is at the Brinks
[1:33:38] right now they're meeting right now
[1:33:41] about resolutions that that the US are
[1:33:43] saying that this has there must be a
[1:33:46] ceasefire I it'll be interesting how it
[1:33:49] all plays out that's all I can say
[1:33:52] because they're not dealing with man
[1:33:54] they're dealing with God they're dealing
[1:33:56] with the prophecy of God's word you
[1:33:59] know just before I go to a couple of
[1:34:02] more quotes here I want to read this
[1:34:04] about 100 years ago Frederick the great
[1:34:07] the king of
[1:34:09] pra was having a discussion with a
[1:34:12] chaplain about the truth of the Bible
[1:34:15] the king had become skeptical about
[1:34:18] Christianity largely through the
[1:34:20] influence of the French atheist voler
[1:34:24] so he said to his chaplain if your Bible
[1:34:27] is really true it ought to be capable of
[1:34:31] a very easy
[1:34:34] proof so often when I have asked for
[1:34:37] proof of the inspiration of the Bible
[1:34:40] I've been given some large to that I
[1:34:43] have neither the time or desire to read
[1:34:47] people want to give a big read this and
[1:34:49] it's this thick and nobody wants that
[1:34:54] if your Bible is really from God you
[1:34:57] should be able to demonstrate the fact
[1:35:01] simply he says give me proof for the
[1:35:04] inspiration of the Bible in a word the
[1:35:07] chaplain replied your majesty it is
[1:35:10] possible for
[1:35:12] me to answer your request
[1:35:16] literally I can give you the proof you
[1:35:19] ask for in one
[1:35:22] word Fred was amazed in this
[1:35:26] response what is the magic word that
[1:35:29] carries such a weight of proof he
[1:35:32] asked he turned and he said
[1:35:37] Israel
[1:35:39] Israel you go
[1:35:42] back it started with
[1:35:45] Israel God's promises started with
[1:35:49] Israel all of the world's problems
[1:35:55] Wars situations they've all stemmed back
[1:35:59] it all started right back in the Middle
[1:36:02] East with
[1:36:05] Israel that was that's something that we
[1:36:08] could never get away from just in the
[1:36:10] same way Israel is the natural proof of
[1:36:13] God's
[1:36:14] word the church and the bride is God's
[1:36:18] Supernatural proof that he is alive and
[1:36:22] that he is well amen praise God glory to
[1:36:25] God I just found that to be interesting
[1:36:28] because it all ties in with the thought
[1:36:31] here we we listen we're talking about
[1:36:33] recognizing our day and by recognizing
[1:36:36] our day we need to stay tuned into world
[1:36:38] events we need to recognize the things
[1:36:40] that are going on around us and we need
[1:36:42] to see how it pertains to us and all the
[1:36:45] the last week and a half all God was was
[1:36:47] putting on my mind was the fullness of
[1:36:49] the Gentile
[1:36:50] bride the fullness of the Gentile bride
[1:36:54] and then I looked it up and it all tied
[1:36:55] in with the fullness of the Gentile
[1:36:57] bride it all tied in with Israel
[1:36:59] everything ties in with the full when
[1:37:01] the Gentiles come into her fullness when
[1:37:04] we come into our completion when the
[1:37:06] last one is perfected and and called
[1:37:08] into the body of Christ then we go and
[1:37:11] the two prophets come on the scene and
[1:37:13] they're the ones that are going to go
[1:37:14] and preach this same
[1:37:16] message that Jesus Christ is the
[1:37:19] Messiah and they're going to receive the
[1:37:21] very same message that we're preaching
[1:37:24] here and we've been listening to for all
[1:37:25] these years we heard a prophet that
[1:37:28] would that God sent to us in the 20th
[1:37:31] century and all he could say Jesus
[1:37:33] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:37:36] forever Jehovah of the Old Testament is
[1:37:39] Jesus of the New Testament amen the Lord
[1:37:42] thy God is one amen praise God
[1:37:45] hallelujah so here he says now he says
[1:37:49] at the end of the Pentecostal age we're
[1:37:52] supposed to receive according to the
[1:37:54] word as God helped me tonight to show
[1:37:57] you through here that we are to see
[1:38:00] receive a messenger that will take all
[1:38:03] those loose ends out there and reveal
[1:38:05] the whole Secret Of God for the
[1:38:08] rapturing of the church and brother
[1:38:11] Brenham was told to go back to
[1:38:13] Jeffersonville to open those Seven Seals
[1:38:16] God was going to open those seals
[1:38:18] because in those seals would contain
[1:38:21] rapturing Faith so that a people could
[1:38:24] be revived listen we needed
[1:38:27] Revival uh listen we're still under
[1:38:30] Revival I'm feeling the Revival of this
[1:38:32] message right now it's running through
[1:38:34] my bones amen glory to God it's what's
[1:38:36] keeping me it's what's it's what's
[1:38:38] giving us a future it's what puts fear
[1:38:41] in the back burner it it has no power
[1:38:44] over us anymore because our future is
[1:38:46] clear amen amen because we've been given
[1:38:50] a word for for this day and for this
[1:38:52] hour amen glory to God listen modern
[1:38:55] events made clear by Vindicated prophecy
[1:38:57] in 1965 we're not living in a
[1:39:00] Pentecostal age we're living in another
[1:39:02] age he says he says see we're not living
[1:39:05] in a Methodist age we're living in
[1:39:07] another age he says we're living up here
[1:39:10] to the bride age that's what he says
[1:39:14] hallelujah the calling out of the church
[1:39:17] and the getting it together for the
[1:39:21] Rapture Hallelujah
[1:39:24] Glory that's what this is doing that's
[1:39:26] what this word is supposed to do it's
[1:39:28] supposed to call people out and to bring
[1:39:31] them in and when they come in they get
[1:39:33] perfected by the word of God they
[1:39:35] receive the word for this hour you don't
[1:39:37] have to drive message books down
[1:39:40] people's throat that's not what
[1:39:41] converted me that's not what converted a
[1:39:44] lot of you it was the supernatural Touch
[1:39:46] of Jesus Amen it was his love when he
[1:39:50] expressed his love to you and he opened
[1:39:52] your understanding and he gave you the
[1:39:54] ability to see his word and to receive
[1:39:57] him and then get delivered from those
[1:39:59] things that were binding you the chains
[1:40:01] of circumstance the chains of depression
[1:40:04] the chains of Oppression all those
[1:40:06] things that are holding the people out
[1:40:08] there there's a way there's a way out
[1:40:10] people it's called Jesus Christ the same
[1:40:13] yesterday today and forever amen glory
[1:40:16] to God he says we're living in a bright
[1:40:17] age and calling out of the church and
[1:40:21] getting it together for the rapture he
[1:40:23] says that's the age we're now living to
[1:40:26] my honest opinion that's exactly the
[1:40:29] truth this was in
[1:40:31] 1965 because in
[1:40:34] 1963 when that seventh seal opened it
[1:40:37] didn't just open for you and me it open
[1:40:39] for brother brandham too it awakened him
[1:40:42] he says my God it's a brand new Bible
[1:40:45] everything's brand new he says glory to
[1:40:48] God and from there he went and preached
[1:40:50] messages who do you say this is a
[1:40:51] greater than Solomon is here here why
[1:40:54] because he recognized that the mighty
[1:40:56] Angel himself had come he preached
[1:40:58] Christ The Mystery of God that was the
[1:41:00] seventh seal being preached the fullness
[1:41:03] of the seventh seal was preached under
[1:41:05] that message Christ The Mystery of God
[1:41:08] because Christ the mystery the whole
[1:41:11] mystery is that Christ is in you amen is
[1:41:15] in me he's quickening us he's taking us
[1:41:19] he's already snatched us from the world
[1:41:22] he'll take one he leave one what do you
[1:41:24] think he's already done he's taken you
[1:41:27] he's pulled you out hallelujah praise
[1:41:30] God what a time it is that we're living
[1:41:32] in he says here something like a
[1:41:34] calendar you look at a calendar to find
[1:41:36] out what day of year you're living in
[1:41:39] and you look at God's Bible to see what
[1:41:41] age you're living in we're not living in
[1:41:43] the Methodist age we're not living in
[1:41:45] the Baptist age we're living in the
[1:41:47] bride Age The Calling bringing back to
[1:41:50] God through a channel that he promised
[1:41:53] to bring it back in thank you Lord

[1:42:13] she's taken it sure it's it's it's sweet

[1:42:29] for me you're too religious man you're
[1:42:30] like you're a fanatic you're this you're
[1:42:32] that no it's it's who you are you can

[1:42:37] the way you are don't you be ashamed of
[1:42:39] Who You Are God made you that way

[1:42:46] his word he's letting the world know
[1:42:48] that I can take a people I can take
[1:42:51] multi-millionaires and I can take them
[1:42:52] right off off the street I can take what
[1:42:55] I want and I can make them declare my

[1:45:59] Luther brought forth Wesley see the
[1:46:01] dying of Wesley brought forth Pentecost
[1:46:04] the dying of Pentecost will bring forth

[1:46:10] hour and he was living in it at that
[1:46:13] time and he was the wave

[1:47:23] out our Pentecostal Brethren are living
[1:47:25] in the glare of a Pentecostal age I
[1:47:28] believe that there's some that are
[1:47:29] living in a
[1:47:30] glare of the mess
[1:47:33] age all they can see is William brandham
[1:47:36] William brandham Brother brandham
[1:47:37] William
[1:47:39] brandham we see him too and we will
[1:47:41] never not see him you can never take him
[1:47:44] out of the equation just like you can't
[1:47:47] take Joseph you can't take Abraham you
[1:47:49] can't take Isaac you you can't take all
[1:47:52] the the prophets because they all are a
[1:47:55] part of the word of God they all make up
[1:47:59] the word but who is the word it's Jesus
[1:48:03] Christ the self-existent one Elohim we
[1:48:06] are his attributes we are portion of God
[1:48:09] and we are going to manifest the portion
[1:48:12] that we are but he will always be the
[1:48:16] one that's on the scene he says now
[1:48:18] they're living in the glare of the
[1:48:20] Pentecostal age and they still miss
[1:48:23] they're trying to interpret the
[1:48:24] Pentecostal age when we're Plum past
[1:48:28] that he says we're living up to the
[1:48:31] rapturing time for the coming of the end
[1:48:35] time amen that's the age that we're
[1:48:39] living
[1:48:40] in may God bless you and give you
[1:48:44] something from these thoughts this
[1:48:48] morning may you go back into
