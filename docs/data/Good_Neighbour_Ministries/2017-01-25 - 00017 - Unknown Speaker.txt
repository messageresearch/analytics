speak to your heart and give you some answers Hallelujah see Matthew 62 say but see ye first the kingdom of God and his right and all these things shall are and also in Matthew 7 says 7 say ask and it shall be given now if you're asking for something don't you have need for something you want something seek and you shall find if you're seeking for something right that mean you either had it and it's lost right and you want to find it right amen KN it shall be open you some doors are closed some Avenues are closed in your life so the word so it's all needs that we have but know something now there is a difference between a want and a need some people want a billion dollar what you want it for but you only need $10 but you want right all green right so God promise that he going to supply all your GRE no close all your wants all your needs according to his riches that is in glory could you bankrupt the bank of heav so whatever you have need of today need God is here to meet that yes Lord so get in track get on track amen hallelujah so ask and it shall be given unto you now I want I want you to ask yourself what do you want to do with your life you know we come to the close of a and as businessmen to take St of their Liv as a good businessman to say where they have been and where they are to know what the future if they can do certain [Music] projects they can put their money into certain stocks of bond area where you can generate funds or do something you know as any individual now check your own veryone what would you like to do with your life now it's a question all of us think about at one one point or the other don't you amen for some the answ comes easy for it may take a lifetime to figure it some people don't even where they are heading in their own life they're just going to the floor doing anything they don't have a a goal in their life amen so anything comes they just follow it I hope your life is not like that because when you place your life in the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ he is going to direct all your ways Hallelujah and before you can do anything set out any Gos in your life commit hands am commit and he shall direct all your amen have you do you believe and have faith in him to trust him all the way have you proven him time and time again in your life that you could put that confidence in amen praise God hallelujah it's easy just to go through the emotions and continue to do what is comfortable and for you know some people like to be in a comfort Z they don't like to take risk at Allen so when you feel your comfortable and you know you only want to do the things that are familiar with around your life they don't want to take any risk you don't really move too far good businessman takes lots of risk they rather fail and try than try to feel that's right amen they're failing to try amen they rather do something right right and fail at it amen amen and take a risk amen praise God hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus for those who of you are seeking profillment in your life who wants to do more we like the Holy Spirit to speak with us don't you want to speak don't you yes I believe that this question would be asked many times in one life in every man or woman there's a thirst of H and and we try in many ways to fulfill that we are all need people who don't [Music] have mhm by by just breathing the next next gas of bread to take that's a need because you need to live stop reading and see [Music] what's Simple Thing as that you need food don't eat as you want to die that's a need you need clothing if it's- 40° outside just go you to freeze mhm that's need CL all these things are necessary for this Natural Life what about hallelujah thank you Lord you see while Jesus was here in human flesh his purpose was to set to do the will of the father and that's what he did God said to eat to live to enjoy all the the the physical blessings you think that's all the need that we have the purpose that we will here on this enjoy everything that said before us there is more than just these physical things amen hallelujah thank you Lord and Jesus accomplished that work but we got one motive that is to set our face to do the will of the father and stay with it as they say as they said be like a postage stand you're stuck on it to do the job till you reach your final destination stick with it the purpose God has called you here for amen and fulfill it amen hallelujah praise be to God hallelujah let the world say what they want and that's up to them see when you decide to serve the Lord Jesus Christ you know the whole world sometimes the think like when you separate yourself from the world and you made a decision to serve the Lord amen you are going against this tree going against the flood of the world system you have lot of opposition amen don't you have B in your life as a Christian if you don't something it's not right because when people recognize you when Satan and all his F recognize you that you are one of God's children they come against you in every every area at work even when you're driving on the street they don't know you but something that they recognize in you that they got to oppose you in all different ways because you know why whatever is inside of them recognize that you are son and daughter Hallelujah you see when the trials and Faith come just to perfect and that's another area of our life we can de with that's a big one testing and trying you know and we've been through that and we in that every single moment that a Son of God needs to be tested and tried and improved hallelujah thank you Lord we are waiting to find out where God God wants us and then go do you want to find out from God what is your purpose here your purpose life am those of you still question what God will have you amen seek Him trust him and he show you Hallelujah now there are seven little seven questions I want to bring forward to you today and number one is what are the things are you most passionate about what are the things that most passionate Hallelujah the first step to living a more fulfilling life is to think about the things that you are passionate about what do you love what fulfills you what work do you do that doesn't feel like good most of us you know employ in the work field working if you're doing what you don't like you will be most miserable you got to enjoy what you do am amen hallelujah otherwise if you're doing such AER something that you don't like find something that you really amen that you love that you will enjoy do seeing and satisf don't let am Hallelujah maybe you enjoy writing maybe you love working with animals or maybe you like have a KN for photographers amen so do do the things that you love doing the things that you're passionate about do you love coming to church that's a big one some people they find church is boring I a lot of well I can't you got to love the Lord and Hallelujah and I want say to you today admonish you set your prior set your prior do the things that you love to do and the things that are most beneficial for your own life and you will see how fulfilling life is going to amen I'm not motivational speak you know have a lot of motival speak I just bring what the Lord on my heart and let today what what you have Hallelujah I just want to stand out cuz a lot of the things that are starting to float that this moment it's not here you prepare yourself as a minister I have something but sometimes that if you leave the element of Supernatural love speak to you that El let God [Music] speak know hallu come he's going to reveal certain things to you that no one else has no idea about no you going to reveal the secrets of your own heart and you want to know that speak and that's where it's hallelujah amen thank you Lord see love not the world or the things of the world and if any man loves the world the love of the father is nothing and if the things of the world take precedence in your life then the real meaning for living is in the real meaning of living if you don't put God and his kingdom first in your life amen you got to really sear out your hallelujah what does AET man think about if he gain this think about it is your soul good more than and the word of God is TR and he said if you have everything here and what what you have a billion or trillion dollars in your back and you can use it as spell what is it used to you people accumulate so so much in their life and they can't even use it so many times they going nursing home they going in hospitals they meet people Rich wealthy people all the the the the movie stars and billions and millions of dollars of properties all but you sit here in your presence God you have the most important thing thank you [Applause] Lord simple humble people sitting in the presence of the Living God creator of Heaven and Earth one day he coming back Hallelujah oh yes because you were with him at one time hallelujah amen hallelujah thank you Lord another thing another question I want to ask what are your greatest accomplishments in life so far Hallelujah you know we talk a little bit you know think back over the years what have you accomplished in your natural life and then tell it to me other what have you accompl in you know stop very s that is good very s that's when you're searching

be a Christian in this age is to be a that's it on now true it's a battle to be a Christian and talk about Christian we talking about the ones do anything and do everything and they say there but to

we need to be a little more Vi the lorded to mean a little more than that to us we should be excited when we together if we not something's wrong that's right that desire inside of your heart to serve him is not really there to be truly born again if you really understand and and have an experience with the Lord right every time have Church you want first one amen godar a voice in your sister
