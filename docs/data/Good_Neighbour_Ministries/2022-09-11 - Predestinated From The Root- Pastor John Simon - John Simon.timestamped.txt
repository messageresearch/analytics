[45:46] God's word here today
[45:49] we want to talk about being
[45:52] predestinated from the root
[45:57] predestinated from the root amen
[46:03] and uh this is just to get started
[46:07] Ephesians 3
[46:09] 17 to 19.
[46:12] praise the Lord
[46:26] Lord of God hallelujah
[46:30] have you got that up there okay praise
[46:32] the Lord okay let us read the word of
[46:36] God
[46:41] and it reads us
[46:44] that Christ May dwell in your hearts by
[46:48] faith
[46:49] that you being rooted and grounded in
[46:53] love
[46:54] may be able to comprehend with All
[46:58] Saints what is the breadth and length
[47:02] and depth and height and to know the
[47:06] love of Christ which passeth knowledge
[47:09] that you may be filled with all the
[47:13] fullness of God
[47:15] amen father we thank you for this the
[47:18] reading of your word now Lord we pray
[47:22] that you'll give to us uh some
[47:25] understanding that we might know you

[47:47] God bless us all here today as we come
[47:52] together in his
[47:54] wonderful presence amen
[47:59] now
[48:00] um Ephesians says that we're being
[48:03] rooted
[48:05] and grounded
[48:07] praise the Lord rooted
[48:09] and grounded
[48:12] thanks be to God
[48:14] that we can be a part of that root
[48:17] and that we can be anchored in it
[48:21] we are anchored by that
[48:23] so we both rooted and grounded uh in the
[48:29] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen
[48:33] so I'm talking about being predestinated
[48:38] um from the very root
[48:41] we have not just
[48:43] um
[48:44] come lately
[48:46] in other words we are not just
[48:48] Christians that just arrive on the scene
[48:52] we were always believers
[48:56] because we were predestinated from sins
[49:00] in the mind of God
[49:02] from before the foundations of the world
[49:05] so we were in The Roots
[49:09] from the very beginning
[49:12] we were rooted then we were rooted in
[49:16] that and we are grounded by that
[49:20] because we were already in his mind
[49:24] so we can then relax and rest in him our
[49:29] Salvation is not of our works but
[49:32] Salvation is of the Lord
[49:35] it's the Lord's doing amen so he's
[49:38] telling you don't pay attention to all
[49:40] these things going around you and what's
[49:43] happening here this mistake you made the
[49:45] other mistake you may go put any
[49:47] emphasis on that keep your eyes on me
[49:50] because salvation is of the Lord
[49:54] Hallelujah pick up yourself dust off
[49:57] Press On Come True the blood has been
[50:00] already provided to wash your cleanse
[50:03] you present your faultless before the
[50:05] throne of grace you are not your own
[50:08] you're bought with a price
[50:10] you belong to him Hallelujah and he said
[50:13] not one that I have in my hand I'm going
[50:16] to not lose not one amen because they're
[50:21] in my hand and Satan can't take them out
[50:24] of my grass Hallelujah I'm so glad I
[50:27] serve a God Like That
[50:30] I'm not resting on my own will my own
[50:33] efforts my life Holiness my own attempts
[50:37] to achieve anything in Christ Hallelujah
[50:41] but all I know is to believe the word
[50:45] and rest in him because he said he will
[50:49] carry me home
[50:51] praise God and I thank God for that and
[50:55] I bless his holy wonderful name amen
[50:58] praise God hallelujah now we understand
[51:01] that uh Jesus is there or Jehovah Jesus
[51:06] is the original tree
[51:09] is that right
[51:11] and we were in the roots of that tree
[51:16] of course you know I I don't go to all
[51:19] of that but in the Garden of Eden the
[51:22] Tree of Life the tree of knowledge of
[51:24] Good and Evil whether Brandon clearly
[51:27] said Jesus was that tree
[51:29] he was the tree right so we understand
[51:33] then we were rooted or we were in that
[51:38] tree
[51:39] praise God now you've got to remember uh
[51:43] later on with brother Branham comes
[51:45] along and tells us that that tree went
[51:48] through the experience of a winter and
[51:50] in the winter the life from the tree
[51:53] goes right into the roots right and
[51:57] during the dark ages of the church the
[52:01] original life that was there on Earth
[52:04] then went in and through the Apostle and
[52:08] the original church and was working on
[52:11] functioning through the original Church
[52:14] Hallelujah he was set to do what restore
[52:19] the Bright Tree in other words to bring
[52:22] back that life on the scene again
[52:26] that the life might come back up amen
[52:31] from The Roots where the life hides in
[52:36] the winter
[52:37] every tree out there as you see with the
[52:40] green leaves they're gonna die
[52:42] or appear to die oh you see what really
[52:46] the life of the tree goes down into the
[52:50] roots
[52:52] and it stays there through the entire
[52:55] winter
[52:56] but when the sun comes up it rises again
[53:00] Hallelujah life comes back and it rises
[53:04] up again so during the Dark Ages the
[53:10] life went into the roots
[53:13] and it stayed there until the
[53:17] restoration of the bright tree
[53:21] and what does that life do the Life
[53:24] Starts to go back out find little
[53:27] branches and things to go into those
[53:30] branches to enable those branches to
[53:34] bear fruit
[53:36] because the vine doesn't bear fruit of
[53:41] itself it needs the branches to Bear the
[53:45] fruits
[53:46] he needs us he says I'm Divine it's you
[53:49] that are the branches and the branch is
[53:52] not to bring forth much fruit amen and
[53:55] we are here to produce fruit
[53:58] now when you say fruits be blood taken
[54:01] are the fruits of the spirit up there
[54:03] and like that which is only part of it
[54:06] but what fruit you are going look if I'm
[54:09] Apple if a tree you're passing in the
[54:13] forest or anywhere on the street and you
[54:16] look and you see a tree and it has
[54:17] apples on them them even crab apples or
[54:21] you pass and you see uh plums on them or
[54:24] something you say oh that's a plum tree
[54:26] yeah oh that's an apple tree the the
[54:29] fruit of the tree is the identification
[54:33] of what kind of a life is operating
[54:37] through that tree
[54:39] and the fruit the or his fruit on this
[54:43] tree of life when it comes up and it
[54:47] reproduces itself it starts to manifest
[54:51] just the original life that was in the
[54:56] roots from the very beginning of time
[54:58] and starts to manifest that and then you
[55:01] know it's an apple tree
[55:03] same thing with a Christian
[55:06] yeah you can make any claim you want you
[55:09] know but we'll see as we go along here
[55:13] amen that you be a real uh original tree
[55:19] that's been
[55:20] predestinated from The Roots praise the
[55:24] Lord amen no uh just to run through it
[55:27] quickly a few things here is first of
[55:31] all we know when we come to Cain and
[55:33] Abel
[55:35] we see a type or a symbol of a grafted
[55:39] tree and an original tree
[55:41] we see King and we see Abel
[55:46] Abel being the son of God
[55:49] and him being the son of the devil
[55:54] each representing something totally
[55:57] different
[55:58] but you see a bell was from the roots
[56:02] and because he was from The Roots when
[56:06] it came time uh for God to show certain
[56:10] things the word came to Abel not the
[56:13] king
[56:15] and okay airbel was able to know that it
[56:19] was blood because sin
[56:22] and he knew what sacrificed the offer
[56:26] listen there was no Bible written yet
[56:29] what does he know about the lamb
[56:31] what does he know about blood being
[56:36] going to be shared what does he know
[56:38] something was revealed to him
[56:41] and what was revealed to him was not
[56:44] written down on any paper or called the
[56:47] Bible or written we need the Bible
[56:49] That's what I'm saying but I'm telling
[56:51] you that the unwritten word was in
[56:54] existence before the written word
[56:57] and the operation of the Holy Spirit of
[57:01] bringing his thoughts to his Believers
[57:04] amen Still Remains the Same
[57:08] but we have a written word now in our
[57:11] day to compare it with to understand
[57:15] what we are receiving and what we have
[57:17] received from a prophet God said that
[57:21] God placed on the earth here
[57:23] so we thank God for that but Abel was an
[57:27] original seed son
[57:31] and look at Isaac
[57:33] Hallelujah you can see it plainly there
[57:36] when he says your wife Sarah is going to
[57:40] Bear a son
[57:42] then he tells not only is it she going
[57:44] to Bear her son she's gonna bury the Sun
[57:47] at this season now I don't that's
[57:50] another message you're gonna go off
[57:52] there with praise God the word comes in
[57:55] a season praise the Lord you see but
[57:58] then we know that he was born
[58:01] then when he was born
[58:03] it was impossible
[58:05] for Abraham and Sarah at their time of
[58:10] life
[58:11] a hundred years old and I think Sarah
[58:14] was 71 years and the five uh something
[58:17] like that oh my and
[58:21] impossible but then she wore the Sun
[58:25] which was the evidence that that sun was
[58:31] A Spoken Word season
[58:34] God displaying again the very same thing
[58:37] that should have been done in the
[58:39] gardener either but he's displaying it
[58:41] here in Abraham and in Sarah that by his
[58:45] spoken word
[58:47] sons and goddess can come on the scene
[58:50] just by the spoken word of God
[58:54] amen see so here was Isaac a spoken word
[58:59] seed son that came from the very root
[59:03] amen hallelujah then you can see Samuel
[59:06] you can see David you can see uh
[59:09] Jeremiah whom he told he said before you
[59:13] were even in your mother's womb
[59:16] I am God I knew you
[59:20] I knew you and I was the one that set
[59:24] you there
[59:25] is that right it's in the book of
[59:27] Jeremiah I sent you there and before you
[59:30] even came here I ordained you to be a
[59:33] prophet when you get down here you are
[59:36] going to be a prophet
[59:38] you're going to preach the word you're
[59:41] going to manifest the word hallelujah
[59:43] amen praise God so he told him that
[59:47] praise God and then we come right down
[59:50] to Jesus himself that he was the root
[59:53] amen foreign
[1:00:00] the same one that spoke to Sarah is now
[1:00:03] speaking to to Mary and said you're
[1:00:06] going to Bear a son and his name is
[1:00:08] going to be Jesus and the rest of it and
[1:00:11] you can go through the scriptures
[1:00:12] there's Paul and you see the
[1:00:14] relationship to the word it's always the
[1:00:17] relationship to the word amen of God
[1:00:21] working through them so it's very
[1:00:24] important
[1:00:26] for it us to recognize that we are in
[1:00:29] The Roots
[1:00:31] is that right I don't know about you but
[1:00:33] I know I am in the root
[1:00:36] I am rooted
[1:00:38] Hallelujah I'm not a Christian of
[1:00:41] today's kind of Christian but I am of
[1:00:46] the Ancient of Days
[1:00:48] Hallelujah ah this kind of Christianity
[1:00:52] is the one they had before the
[1:00:55] foundations of the world
[1:00:57] when the sons and God is of God's son
[1:01:00] shouted I rejoice in the presence of God
[1:01:04] and that's the same kind of religion or
[1:01:07] faith that we are practicing here today
[1:01:10] we're not practicing one that is done
[1:01:14] because of practice
[1:01:16] but or or because of discipline amen but
[1:01:21] we are doing something that is
[1:01:23] spontaneous
[1:01:25] something that just combustes it within
[1:01:28] your soul
[1:01:29] You Want To Praise Him you want to
[1:01:31] Magnify Him you want to glorify him
[1:01:33] because you are seeing something
[1:01:38] you personally are experiencing an
[1:01:41] individual revelation of God to your own
[1:01:45] heart
[1:01:47] I am not teaching out my television
[1:01:49] because the pastor told me to
[1:01:52] I am not tearing up this magazine over
[1:01:54] here I'm not saying that you shouldn't
[1:01:56] I'm just trying to make a point here
[1:01:58] okay so don't leave and say oh brother
[1:02:01] Simon said listen that which is totally
[1:02:03] perverted I am just saying we are no
[1:02:07] more which I did earlier but you see
[1:02:11] when you were a child you had to speak
[1:02:14] as a child you had to have your parents
[1:02:16] tell you oh don't do that don't do this
[1:02:19] don't do that don't go here watch what
[1:02:22] time you come home in the night Boy
[1:02:25] you know you have to have your parents
[1:02:28] do that at that time but when you be
[1:02:31] Paul said when you become a man you put
[1:02:34] away childish things
[1:02:36] it's all right what does that mean
[1:02:38] because now the Holy Spirit as James
[1:02:41] said we have a witness that is within us
[1:02:45] we have an inside teacher that teaches
[1:02:49] and guides us hallelujah we have the
[1:02:52] comforter who is with us
[1:02:54] he will both convict you of
[1:02:56] righteousness and show you have Holiness
[1:02:58] things to come but he will also Comfort
[1:03:01] your heart and point you back to the
[1:03:04] blood he will always be there with you
[1:03:08] Hallelujah
[1:03:09] that's why Paul said we are free in
[1:03:11] Christ
[1:03:12] and when you're free you don't look at
[1:03:15] who drinks coffee and who don't
[1:03:17] uh who keeps the new moon and and who
[1:03:21] keeps the full moon
[1:03:25] see
[1:03:27] because you are past that
[1:03:30] because God may make that one man
[1:03:35] um
[1:03:36] watch at the television see certain news
[1:03:40] hear certain things and you
[1:03:44] not one military life he will not allow
[1:03:47] you to do it
[1:03:48] but then you shouldn't go and turn and
[1:03:50] tell the other man because you don't
[1:03:52] know how God is using him so what you've
[1:03:55] got to do with that it's what Paul said
[1:03:57] that have compare themselves among
[1:03:59] themselves they're not wives you see
[1:04:02] each person has an individual revelation
[1:04:05] of God
[1:04:06] but all that has to line up with the
[1:04:10] world
[1:04:11] both front side and backside has got to
[1:04:14] line right up with the word and if your
[1:04:17] Revelation doesn't agree or light up
[1:04:20] with the word the prophet said in Christ
[1:04:22] is a mystery then you've got the wrong
[1:04:24] Revelation go back and check it with the
[1:04:27] words
[1:04:28] with the Holy Spirit and see what God is
[1:04:30] doing in and through your life amen
[1:04:33] glory to God God is wonderful isn't he
[1:04:37] praise the name of the Lord I'm so glad
[1:04:40] that he's the same Mighty God Amen
[1:04:44] praise God hallelujah amen now we know
[1:04:49] that that
[1:04:51] part of the word
[1:04:53] that we have to manifest in this age is
[1:04:57] not the foot it's not the the the the
[1:05:00] the knees is not the stomach you know
[1:05:04] I'm going through the building of his
[1:05:06] body that brother Branham spoke about
[1:05:08] Through the Ages he was building from
[1:05:10] the feet to you know the foundations and
[1:05:13] right up and then to the age where
[1:05:15] Wesley come with sanctification that
[1:05:17] partner cleanses the body cleanses
[1:05:20] itself and comes up to the speaking age
[1:05:22] where the Pentecostal is building his
[1:05:25] spiritual body and speaking tongues and
[1:05:29] everything else and then he says now he
[1:05:31] brought us now to the ceas
[1:05:34] where Prophet comes on the scene a Seer
[1:05:38] that can see the word
[1:05:40] manifest the word now praise God he says
[1:05:44] but now it's going beyond that but to
[1:05:48] the stage where there is no moving Parts
[1:05:51] amen it's going to break to the mind
[1:05:55] right right to the Mind Hallelujah but
[1:05:58] even when it goes to the Mind Adam lay
[1:06:02] on the ground with everything perfect
[1:06:04] but God still had to come and
[1:06:07] borrow the Breath of Life
[1:06:09] now we're back to life the life in there
[1:06:13] amen so now we understand clearly then
[1:06:16] that this age is not here to manifest
[1:06:21] gifts
[1:06:23] this
[1:06:25] Edge is not to manifest even brother
[1:06:29] branham's gift
[1:06:31] amen so it will have all of those things
[1:06:34] between the body right but it's not here
[1:06:37] to manifest not not just brother
[1:06:39] problems gift it's here now to the stage
[1:06:43] where the seed has come back
[1:06:47] to all the cycle and Back to the Sea
[1:06:50] Jesus over here one man with all the
[1:06:53] life in him
[1:06:55] gone in the ground rises again but when
[1:06:58] he comes back up he himself said it it
[1:07:00] would be the same one seed You're Gonna
[1:07:02] See it'll come up a thousandfold he's
[1:07:04] talking about a bright body
[1:07:07] he's talking about a many-membered body
[1:07:10] that his literal life that was back
[1:07:14] there in one man as now as it showed
[1:07:18] under their Pentecost it's gonna break
[1:07:20] itself up into little pieces pieces and
[1:07:24] it will be in thousands of Believers
[1:07:28] that trust his word and I will live in
[1:07:31] them they will walk with me and I'll be
[1:07:34] in them there will be my people and I
[1:07:38] will be their God God in Christ Christ
[1:07:41] in the church amen the kingdom being
[1:07:44] restored amen God restoring the kingdom
[1:07:48] once again for his glory amen hallelujah
[1:07:52] so it's your original life that was in
[1:07:56] Christ that will be manifested in each
[1:08:00] one of us
[1:08:02] you see but he don't look like like
[1:08:05] Jesus is supposed to or she doesn't act
[1:08:08] like you see brother Brandon said he is
[1:08:11] the great diamond
[1:08:12] and off of the diamond come all kinds of
[1:08:15] colors all kinds of colors amen what is
[1:08:18] that different uh um different lights of
[1:08:23] his person or personality none of us is
[1:08:27] going to reflect the whole thing because
[1:08:29] he is the only one that can reflect the
[1:08:32] whole thing but each one of us is going
[1:08:35] to have a part of his character and
[1:08:37] characteristic manifesting through US
[1:08:40] amen yes playing to the world that
[1:08:44] Christ is in you Christ is in me Christ
[1:08:47] is in every True Believer that trusts
[1:08:50] his word and believes it completely amen
[1:08:54] hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah
[1:08:58] now there's a wonderful sermon called
[1:09:02] works is Faith expressed and to read
[1:09:06] that will be a real blessing to read any
[1:09:08] of them will be a real blessing but I'm
[1:09:11] focused upon a little bit of this here
[1:09:14] today A little bit of that and a little
[1:09:16] bit in the anointed ones at the end time
[1:09:18] also we understand of course
[1:09:22] that God prepared good ground
[1:09:27] to receive his seed
[1:09:31] if you
[1:09:33] will read Matthew 7 15-20 you will see
[1:09:38] the parable
[1:09:40] of the sore
[1:09:42] and the different kinds of soil
[1:09:45] that the seed can fall into
[1:09:49] but now the
[1:09:52] possessed
[1:09:57] seed to come and fall into
[1:10:00] praise God that's why sometimes God
[1:10:03] preached the message prepared ground
[1:10:05] that you didn't just happen you were
[1:10:09] purposed and prepared by God and placed
[1:10:12] in this certain age to receive the word
[1:10:17] that is your purpose of being here when
[1:10:21] others rejected walk away from it get
[1:10:24] tired of it uh you know can't see it no
[1:10:27] more you can't have seen nothing else
[1:10:31] amen Jesus had over 500 disciples but
[1:10:37] then when he began to come down to his
[1:10:39] third pole and begin to make the world
[1:10:43] reveal manifest they said this is too
[1:10:47] much I I can't take this anymore it
[1:10:50] don't make sense the intellectuals get
[1:10:52] knocked out now say oh my and the Bible
[1:10:57] says in John chapter 6 and they all left
[1:11:00] him
[1:11:02] but then when we go to book of Acts
[1:11:04] chapter 2 it says 120 in the upper room
[1:11:07] that means 380 of them walk away from
[1:11:10] him
[1:11:11] but 120 was in the upper room is that
[1:11:15] right oh praise be to God my my see some
[1:11:20] were prepared ground
[1:11:22] and the others were not prepared to
[1:11:26] receive that
[1:11:27] and then what did they say he says do
[1:11:29] you also want to go away
[1:11:31] amen that's like a preacher that
[1:11:34] literally trying to preach the people
[1:11:35] out of his own church
[1:11:37] because Jesus said you want to go to if
[1:11:40] you want to go you can go to because now
[1:11:42] the whole thing gone right back to free
[1:11:44] moral agency you're free to come you're
[1:11:46] free to stay you're free to worship
[1:11:48] you're free to shout you're free to
[1:11:50] dance you're you're free to leave you're
[1:11:52] free to come amen that's not you can't
[1:11:56] really put anybody out of the real true
[1:11:59] Church of the Living God
[1:12:07] their eyes are not on you their eyes
[1:12:10] should be on the word
[1:12:13] there we go
[1:12:16] what is the word saying they go they
[1:12:19] said master
[1:12:21] um that was the words of eternal life uh
[1:12:25] where else we're going to go to hear
[1:12:27] this where else we gonna go to receive
[1:12:30] this oh my praise God you're in the
[1:12:34] desert there's only one water hole
[1:12:36] there's only one Oasis and you're gonna
[1:12:39] leave that and wander off hoping to find
[1:12:42] another one uh somewhere else and they
[1:12:45] said where are we going to go you the
[1:12:48] word of eternal life we can't leave the
[1:12:51] revealed work because we're seeing that
[1:12:53] we reckon recognize what we're seeing we
[1:12:55] know who we are we know what we are
[1:12:58] raised up for
[1:13:00] praise God for your original life that
[1:13:02] is within our hearts within our souls oh
[1:13:05] blessed be the name of the Living God
[1:13:07] hallelujah amen praise God Amen so the
[1:13:12] good ground prepared by God because he
[1:13:16] knows farming better than any farmer
[1:13:20] ain't no farmer is going to go out there
[1:13:23] and just take seed and throw them
[1:13:24] anywhere like that
[1:13:26] he wants to prepare the ground
[1:13:29] so that when that seed Falls he's
[1:13:32] assured that that's going to be a
[1:13:34] germanization
[1:13:36] there's going to something that'll come
[1:13:38] forth when that seed hits the ground
[1:13:41] with some moisture something is going to
[1:13:44] take place
[1:13:45] so he prepared the ground
[1:13:48] beforehand hallelujah amen and we know
[1:13:52] uh not to spend time on this but we know
[1:13:55] that the good ground that God prepared
[1:13:59] is the gene
[1:14:01] that he prepared a place to be there in
[1:14:05] you waiting for the red latter and
[1:14:09] former the word
[1:14:11] to come in in season
[1:14:15] and thank God we are receiving the
[1:14:18] Harvest rain
[1:14:19] we're receiving the going home ring
[1:14:22] we're receiving the rain to make you
[1:14:25] manifest what is in your Hallelujah
[1:14:30] you're not to work yourself up but when
[1:14:33] the rain falls on the seed the seed all
[1:14:36] the seed has to do is drink and grow
[1:14:38] drink and manifest drink and show forth
[1:14:41] drink and live amen that's all it's got
[1:14:44] to do look real believing Christianity
[1:14:47] is not hard
[1:14:49] it's not hard because if you cast your
[1:14:52] burdens on him he he will take care of
[1:14:55] it and he will take you through
[1:14:58] [Applause]
[1:15:02] so the word for each Edge coming in each
[1:15:05] Edge falls on the gene of the Believers
[1:15:08] that were predestinated for that age
[1:15:11] some to manifest only justification some
[1:15:14] to manifest only justification plus
[1:15:17] sanctification some to manifest just
[1:15:19] justification sanctification and
[1:15:22] Pentecostal experience right and there's
[1:15:25] another says that there were there they
[1:15:28] were prepared beforehand that when this
[1:15:32] message comes it will cause them to not
[1:15:35] they can manifest all those other things
[1:15:37] but that's not what they are supposed to
[1:15:40] manifest mainly what they are supposed
[1:15:42] to manifest and display to the world is
[1:15:46] that the original life that it was in
[1:15:49] the root has returned
[1:15:52] that life is here the power is here the
[1:15:56] presence of God Among Us Hallelujah the
[1:15:59] Cry of the king is within the camp amen
[1:16:02] I think the Bible said the shout of the
[1:16:05] king is in the camp so we praise God
[1:16:07] hallelujah that this is what we are here
[1:16:11] doing what we are supposed to do
[1:16:13] so I don't see a whole lot of gifts
[1:16:16] amongst them I don't see speaking in
[1:16:18] tongues amongst it's all here
[1:16:21] but the lonely manifest when God wants
[1:16:24] it to be made manifested
[1:16:27] it's no more us coming to try to do
[1:16:30] those things to bring self gratification
[1:16:33] and
[1:16:35] self-attention right no no no no no no
[1:16:38] no no matter of fact the brother Brown
[1:16:40] said they are going to want to live the
[1:16:42] hidden life they don't want to even be
[1:16:44] noticed yeah or anything like that but
[1:16:47] they can't help it when that manifests
[1:16:50] through them it'll catch people's
[1:16:51] attention but that's not them doing that
[1:16:54] that's him and that's when he receives
[1:16:57] all the glory unto him his self amen
[1:17:01] amen so we thank God that he prepared
[1:17:05] the ground
[1:17:07] for so that when the world would fall in
[1:17:11] an age the ground would already be
[1:17:15] prepared
[1:17:16] the gene will already be in the hearts
[1:17:19] of the believer
[1:17:21] listen Jesus was the flesh the father
[1:17:25] was the life or spirit is that right
[1:17:29] and he turned around and said oh the
[1:17:32] ground and the seed is really not two
[1:17:34] different things it's the same I am the
[1:17:37] father I want
[1:17:38] if you look at it you see that I am the
[1:17:40] father are what right Jesus and the
[1:17:43] father are one the ground and the scene
[1:17:47] is really one
[1:17:48] but we have to say it exactly how they
[1:17:51] said in the Bible here that you might
[1:17:53] recognize that the gene that was God
[1:17:56] allowed it and predestinated to be here
[1:18:00] amen so that when the word for the age
[1:18:04] comes
[1:18:06] there is a ready prepared ground for it
[1:18:10] to fall on
[1:18:12] it's all right praise God do you believe
[1:18:15] that
[1:18:16] and when the word falls upon that Gene
[1:18:21] or upon that life of that believer that
[1:18:24] was there waiting praise God and it
[1:18:28] strikes that what is that Gene going to
[1:18:31] produce
[1:18:34] the G
[1:18:36] or seed has to produce whatever tree it
[1:18:41] came from
[1:18:42] from back in the original
[1:18:45] so so all you see now is just an
[1:18:48] ordinary person you just see an ordinary
[1:18:51] seed but then the word falls on it
[1:18:54] but whatever that's that Gene that
[1:18:57] produces it comes back out and that is
[1:19:02] the life that identifies it of what
[1:19:06] origin it is from where it come from
[1:19:09] amen that it was a part of God from
[1:19:14] before the being
[1:19:16] it was in The Roots it was in God before
[1:19:20] the beginning
[1:19:21] but only now to be made manifest
[1:19:25] only now to be revealed to the rest of
[1:19:29] the world praise the name of the Lord
[1:19:30] hallelujah and that's why I thank God
[1:19:33] that he prepared the people beforehand
[1:19:37] to receive him
[1:19:39] to embody him that he could live in US
[1:19:42] temples of the Living God you believe
[1:19:44] you're a temple we are temples of the
[1:19:47] Living God oh my it doesn't matter what
[1:19:51] shape you have what color you have what
[1:19:53] uh height what the whatever God doesn't
[1:19:56] care about that but he prepared you as a
[1:19:58] temple
[1:20:00] amen and he wanted to know that there
[1:20:03] are these temples here waiting for him
[1:20:06] that when he comes he is able to fill
[1:20:10] them and use them and live in them and
[1:20:13] walk in them and manifest through them
[1:20:15] because they've been prepared ground
[1:20:17] prepared beforehand for his divine
[1:20:20] presence blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:20:23] God hallelujah amen so you'll find here
[1:20:26] in the uh what's his faith expressed he
[1:20:30] says now he says talking about this you
[1:20:33] can see
[1:20:34] predestination coming into Plain View
[1:20:38] that you can see what predestination is
[1:20:42] all about hallelujah amen praise God
[1:20:46] it's God showing to you
[1:20:48] his word
[1:20:50] and by showing to you his word he's also
[1:20:54] identifying to you you are predestinated
[1:20:59] you're my son you're my daughter you're
[1:21:02] my child
[1:21:03] because the word came to you
[1:21:06] the word always come to a
[1:21:09] predestinated vessel
[1:21:11] can't go nowhere else it only comes to
[1:21:15] the ones that were predestinated to hear
[1:21:18] it and to receive it
[1:21:21] only they can manifest the word of God
[1:21:23] only the spirit of God moving within
[1:21:26] their soul
[1:21:27] them to manifest the word of the Living
[1:21:30] God Amen yes sir amen hallelujah o
[1:21:35] praise God and when God reveals this
[1:21:37] word to you you don't have to go
[1:21:39] stammering about
[1:21:41] wondering if you're a Christian we're
[1:21:43] not wandering Stars
[1:21:45] we're not wandering this and wandering
[1:21:47] this and wandering over here and
[1:21:49] wandering over there and wondering about
[1:21:51] that no we are second of God
[1:21:56] and we can say I know that I know that I
[1:21:59] know that I know I I recognize who I am
[1:22:03] and what I came down here for Why God
[1:22:06] has me here on the scene amen praise God

[1:22:12] spoke about it he said he saw Thrones
[1:22:15] and uh and crowns cast down to the Earth
[1:22:18] and he said and the people in the last
[1:22:21] days those people that know their God
[1:22:24] they're amen they will be strong
[1:22:26] Hallelujah they'll do exploits amen

[1:22:59] God hallelujah amen hallelujah look we
[1:23:04] we are who God says we are
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:08] it's not who people think you are or say
[1:23:11] you are
[1:23:13] we are who God says we are
[1:23:16] and we can do what God says we can do
[1:23:20] it he said I don't know if I'm going to
[1:23:22] be able to live this life I don't know
[1:23:24] if I'm going to be able to live that way
[1:23:26] or do this or do that amen praise God
[1:23:29] listen you can do what God says you can
[1:23:33] do
[1:23:35] because he knows you better than
[1:23:37] yourself
[1:23:38] he knows me better than myself
[1:23:40] amen when he came to Gideon he says
[1:23:43] Gideon you're going to be the deliverer
[1:23:45] foreign
[1:23:56] [Music]
[1:24:01] the angel just calls him out amen praise
[1:24:05] God but you see that is what it is the
[1:24:08] devil tried to cover up some of our
[1:24:10] lives with mud and Mock and all kinds of
[1:24:14] things uh cover it up so that people
[1:24:17] can't see the real you but but but they
[1:24:21] see all these things that may be
[1:24:23] associated with your life and it
[1:24:26] distracts them by looking at that and
[1:24:28] they don't see Christ in you working out
[1:24:30] his works of glory amen but God is
[1:24:34] calling every one of us to attention of
[1:24:37] his word amen praise God God is calling
[1:24:42] for us to get the spirit of Joshua and
[1:24:44] Caleb
[1:24:46] to be able to say no matter how Wicked
[1:24:49] this world is no matter how much chaos
[1:24:52] there is out there no matter what the
[1:24:54] system says we are able to go up and
[1:24:58] take the country
[1:25:00] we are able to live by this word
[1:25:04] we are able to take this mountain
[1:25:07] Hallelujah we can take it by the grace
[1:25:10] of God because the life that is in us
[1:25:14] has done it already and he can do it
[1:25:16] again and he lives in me praise God
[1:25:22] Hallelujah he lives in me and he lives
[1:25:25] in you
[1:25:26] praise God amen amen praise God Amen
[1:25:31] looking at Giants amen there's still a
[1:25:35] lot of people looking at the Giants and
[1:25:36] the message
[1:25:38] they're looking at the Giant's
[1:25:40] theological Giants or anything like that
[1:25:42] now if I wanted I could have taken that
[1:25:45] route but but I just walk away from all
[1:25:48] of that because once this word message
[1:25:51] got into my hand
[1:25:53] and I began to feel the pulsation of the
[1:25:57] Holy Spirit I didn't need to read a
[1:26:00] hundred books or hear a hundred messages
[1:26:02] the moment the first night uh that those
[1:26:06] two books drop into my hand I know right
[1:26:09] then
[1:26:11] that man is a prophet
[1:26:15] and whatever he says I'm going to
[1:26:18] believe it
[1:26:19] it wasn't just the written word of what
[1:26:22] he was saying but the atmosphere this
[1:26:25] hear it the anointing that was coming
[1:26:28] off of that word that I could fear maybe
[1:26:32] don't mean nothing to anybody else but
[1:26:33] to me I feel the impact of the Holy
[1:26:37] Spirit shaking my soul hallelujah amen
[1:26:40] it's almost like God sent you with a
[1:26:42] tuning fork when he sums up the word it
[1:26:46] it can strike that tuning fork and
[1:26:49] produce the exact sound they're told
[1:26:51] that he wants to produce amen hallelujah
[1:26:55] I tell you you don't have to worry about
[1:26:57] nothing once you catch this revelation
[1:26:59] of the word of God the word will do its
[1:27:02] own work in you yeah
[1:27:04] the word will clean you up the word will
[1:27:07] straighten you out the word will do
[1:27:09] everything that needs to be done if you
[1:27:11] surrender yourself to him the word of
[1:27:15] the Living God
[1:27:17] now brother Branham is about to speak
[1:27:20] about the grafted tree
[1:27:23] he talked about going to Arizona to uh a
[1:27:27] brother Charlotte
[1:27:28] and he says and while we were at this
[1:27:31] place I noticed he had a tree and the
[1:27:35] tree had about nine different kinds of
[1:27:37] fruits on it
[1:27:39] foreign
[1:27:44] how could this tree do that he said well
[1:27:48] it's an orange tree he said you see some
[1:27:51] of the branches are only bearing oranges
[1:27:54] because that's an uh oh uh orange
[1:27:57] branches but these are the branches I
[1:28:01] graphed them on when they were small and
[1:28:04] there is grapefruit
[1:28:05] there is tangelo and so on Citrus you're
[1:28:10] all citrus they are religious so so so I
[1:28:13] can graph them in so he grafted it in to
[1:28:17] the original orange tree now really you
[1:28:21] know that's speaking about Christ as the
[1:28:23] original Dream
[1:28:25] and anybody with a religious spirit
[1:28:29] they can be grafted into the tree
[1:28:33] but if they're grafted in it means you
[1:28:35] are not from the original life
[1:28:38] it means no matter how hard you try how
[1:28:41] many how many uh books you read how much
[1:28:44] studies you do you cannot produce your
[1:28:47] original life
[1:28:48] because you are not in the roots you
[1:28:51] work from The Roots
[1:28:53] amen you are coming now by your own
[1:28:56] efforts your own achievements your own
[1:28:58] Ambitions to be able to do that but you
[1:29:01] cannot do it because you're not from the
[1:29:04] roots amen oh my yes sir I'll just move
[1:29:08] on back to here to the court here he
[1:29:11] says the True Vine
[1:29:14] and the false Vine
[1:29:17] both have the same anointing upon them
[1:29:21] the rain falls in the just and the
[1:29:23] unjust
[1:29:24] doesn't matter if it's a weed or it's
[1:29:27] the real original
[1:29:29] he says both jumped and praised God
[1:29:32] because they were hot they were thirsty
[1:29:35] they were starving you know uh and the
[1:29:39] rain falls so what water had released
[1:29:43] both got released by the rain falling
[1:29:46] but that's not what's important what
[1:29:49] seed is in there what seed was hit back
[1:29:54] there amen but and then the rain comes
[1:29:58] as a lot of people thinks that when the
[1:30:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost come it
[1:30:04] doesn't come to bring you eternal life
[1:30:07] you have to have eternal life in you
[1:30:10] before
[1:30:12] I'm going that deep calls back to this
[1:30:16] deep that is in you amen the Deep closer
[1:30:21] deep under deeper response
[1:30:24] calls up to that Gene the voice of that
[1:30:28] Mighty Angel the Seventh Son of voice
[1:30:31] speaking truth Revelation in the heart
[1:30:34] of the believer or stick to that Gene
[1:30:37] what happened it manifests and come to
[1:30:40] life amen
[1:30:42] wow amen the truth sits together like a
[1:30:47] hand in a glove
[1:30:48] what you are hearing fits your soul
[1:30:51] fetch your being
[1:30:53] amen praise God you will recognize it
[1:30:57] amen hallelujah oh praise God when you
[1:31:00] get past all them things the devil
[1:31:02] trying to tell oh that man is just
[1:31:04] trying to convince you oh that guy is
[1:31:05] trying to persuade you look I don't have
[1:31:08] to persuade nobody I don't have to try
[1:31:10] to convince anybody of anything I am
[1:31:13] just here preaching the word and let the
[1:31:16] word Minister himself to every heart in
[1:31:19] here
[1:31:20] [Applause]
[1:31:21] praise the name of the Lord the True
[1:31:24] Vine and the false spine both have the
[1:31:28] same anointing
[1:31:29] but the water fell on both of them
[1:31:32] Hallelujah you see no wonder we it he
[1:31:37] said it would deceive the elected if it
[1:31:41] was possible
[1:31:43] if it was possible but we are not
[1:31:46] deceived why not because you're smarter
[1:31:48] Abraham wasn't smarter Abraham wasn't
[1:31:51] better than any of the rest of people
[1:31:53] there it's just that God called him out
[1:31:55] by Grace amen it's the same thing God
[1:31:58] placed a gene in you he placed part of
[1:32:01] himself in you we call that the
[1:32:04] attribute of God in you the seed of God
[1:32:07] in you a place in you amen before the
[1:32:11] foundation of the world you I repeat
[1:32:14] over again we are not creatures of time
[1:32:17] future home of the Heavenly Pride he
[1:32:19] says we come from eternity and we are
[1:32:21] going back to Eternity
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:24] from God and I go back to God
[1:32:27] Hallelujah the way I'm I am the way the
[1:32:31] truth and the life amen the way you know
[1:32:36] praise God hallelujah amen amen praise
[1:32:40] the Lord now look at the word test of
[1:32:44] how they are going to prove where
[1:32:46] they're from
[1:32:48] let the
[1:32:50] word
[1:32:53] Holy Spirit fall on the word they claim
[1:32:56] to have in them and then watch them
[1:32:59] manifest an intellectual interpretation
[1:33:03] of the word instead of the original
[1:33:09] interpretation of the word
[1:33:11] the original manifestation of the world
[1:33:15] watch them produce a a practice
[1:33:21] tetraco Christian Life
[1:33:23] that reaches up to the nominational
[1:33:25] standards a Christian is supposed to be
[1:33:28] like this like this like this like this
[1:33:30] and you don't live up to that you don't
[1:33:34] live up to those standards you're not
[1:33:36] really a Christian right but the real
[1:33:40] Believers pointing you back to the word
[1:33:42] this is what you've got to look in the
[1:33:45] mirror here and see everything is all
[1:33:48] right you see praise the name of the
[1:33:50] Lord that your suit is not Twisted one
[1:33:53] side
[1:33:54] is that right that your tie is not
[1:33:57] skewed
[1:33:59] that your dress is not hanging why
[1:34:02] because you looked in the mirror praise
[1:34:05] God oh my that goes for every single one
[1:34:09] of us here praise the name of the Lord
[1:34:11] amen yeah they look the same and when
[1:34:14] you go into the church they're they're
[1:34:16] all Christians they look the same is
[1:34:19] that right what but by their fruits
[1:34:21] Jesus said You shall know them what
[1:34:24] they're bearing what they are
[1:34:26] manifesting by that you're going to know
[1:34:29] if they're of the word
[1:34:31] or if they're not of the world that
[1:34:34] doesn't mean you're going to become
[1:34:35] judgmental accusatory or anything of
[1:34:38] that nature but it's for you to
[1:34:40] recognize
[1:34:41] and once you recognize then you know how
[1:34:44] to act how to walk and how to talk by
[1:34:46] the grace of God Hallelujah by their
[1:34:49] Fruit by their life you're going to know
[1:34:51] them by what life they're manifesting
[1:34:54] amen hallelujah that fourth stage of the
[1:34:58] Bright Tree what is it the life bringing
[1:35:00] the tree back to life
[1:35:03] bring the tree back to life amen so we
[1:35:06] are in that stage here right now amen
[1:35:09] when that tree that's planted by the
[1:35:12] rivers of Living Waters it is coming to
[1:35:15] life and has come to life again by the
[1:35:18] grace of God hallelujah manifest they're
[1:35:21] manifesting something but they're not
[1:35:24] manifesting the life that was in the
[1:35:26] root from the original in the beginning
[1:35:29] it was not so
[1:35:31] we've got to come back to that original
[1:35:33] life living through us
[1:35:36] not us trying to go out there and say oh
[1:35:39] brother random preacher and the statue
[1:35:41] of a perfect man I gotta have faith I
[1:35:43] gotta have virtue I gotta have knowledge
[1:35:45] oh my goodness it's all in you
[1:35:49] because if the Lord Jesus Christ lives
[1:35:52] in you he is all perfection
[1:35:55] but now you've got to live it out or
[1:35:58] manifest it as I've always said or work
[1:36:01] out your salvation or manifest whatever
[1:36:04] as you say you're saved but you got to
[1:36:06] make it manifest so that people will
[1:36:08] know about the grace of God hallelujah
[1:36:11] amen now how do you know what it is
[1:36:15] that it isn't an orange
[1:36:19] amen because when you look
[1:36:23] at that branch the branch is bearing a
[1:36:27] grapefruit
[1:36:29] even though
[1:36:31] it's also in the Vine
[1:36:33] it's hanging from the same tree
[1:36:36] it's claiming to be a Christian
[1:36:39] but watch the life that is manifesting
[1:36:42] through that Veil that vessel that you
[1:36:46] can discern and know what kind of a life
[1:36:49] is back there hallelujah amen praise the
[1:36:54] name of the Lord amen and there's a lot
[1:36:56] of people in this message that making
[1:36:59] all kinds of claim and but that life
[1:37:01] when you look at it the life is not in
[1:37:04] the world life is full of tricks in
[1:37:06] other words that life that is
[1:37:08] manifesting through them
[1:37:10] could be a life that's full of scheming
[1:37:13] a life full of trickery
[1:37:16] a life full of being proud of being
[1:37:19] smart and I don't mean Smart in the
[1:37:23] sense of smart of knowledge and knowing
[1:37:25] the things of how to go through life
[1:37:28] that's not the smart I'm taught I'm
[1:37:30] talking about the evil devilish coming
[1:37:33] of the of Satan working through them
[1:37:37] Amen in such a way my friend the life
[1:37:41] manifested is not from the war
[1:37:45] the real orange the life comes from the
[1:37:48] roots for it was predestinated from The
[1:37:52] Roots amen praise the name of the Lord
[1:37:54] hallelujah amen praise God I'm in the
[1:37:58] bride
[1:38:01] amen anybody can claim that
[1:38:04] you see anybody can claim that that's
[1:38:07] become a just a another word I'm in the
[1:38:10] bride I'm in the message
[1:38:13] I believe the prophet
[1:38:15] I believe all the prophets men
[1:38:18] I go to sleep listening to the prophet I
[1:38:21] I fast I pray whatever you see that's
[1:38:25] wonderful and we should do that but
[1:38:28] that's not what it is what is the life
[1:38:31] that's being produced by the Revelation
[1:38:35] that is within your heart
[1:38:38] and that proves what it is back there
[1:38:42] amen because we are not going by that we
[1:38:45] are here and all we're doing at every
[1:38:48] minute we're listening to the voice of
[1:38:50] God we're listening for the seven
[1:38:52] Thunders to speak amen that Mighty Angel
[1:38:56] to make known to us his Divine Wills
[1:39:00] praise the name of the Lord I'm going to
[1:39:02] start bringing this to a close up here
[1:39:05] praise God Amen I know I'm giving you uh
[1:39:09] enough for the word and more to come but
[1:39:12] uh you we're living in physical bodies
[1:39:16] and we have to respect and recognize
[1:39:18] that also amen praise the name of the
[1:39:21] Lord Jesus now
[1:39:23] it's bearing grapefruit fruit
[1:39:26] it isn't like the first one
[1:39:29] and if a church says they believe Jesus
[1:39:33] Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:39:35] forever
[1:39:36] and uh then we'll find out
[1:39:41] it will then have the of the life of
[1:39:44] Jesus Christ
[1:39:45] but no matter if the life is pouring
[1:39:48] into it if it is not predestinated from
[1:39:53] the roots
[1:39:55] it will bear nothing but grapefruit
[1:39:59] you see if that original life is not
[1:40:02] pouring in amen into there and falling
[1:40:07] on that good ground that was prepared
[1:40:10] beforehand it can only produce
[1:40:14] grapefruit amen hallelujah amen so he
[1:40:19] prepared you and I so that the seed word
[1:40:23] of God could fall on some good ground
[1:40:26] because there's all kinds of soil out
[1:40:28] there rocky soil uh thorns and thistles
[1:40:32] on the ground and and so on and he
[1:40:36] prepared us particularly to be fertile
[1:40:39] ground to receive the word of God
[1:40:42] forever Hallelujah and the reason for
[1:40:46] that is so that the seed could have a
[1:40:50] chance to reproduce itself
[1:40:55] let me stop there because now there's
[1:40:58] another thought going off there you see
[1:41:00] how could the seed go into the ground
[1:41:03] supposedly to
[1:41:05] manifest itself reproduce itself but it
[1:41:09] comes back up manifesting a grapefruit
[1:41:12] you can't do it
[1:41:14] then it proves to you that that was not
[1:41:17] the original it was not the original
[1:41:20] scene that went into the ground praise
[1:41:23] God but I'm glad that when the word fell
[1:41:27] on me amen It produced the original life
[1:41:32] It produced Jesus Christ
[1:41:35] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:41:38] praise the Lord hallelujah you say
[1:41:41] brother Simon
[1:41:43] um I'm thankful for the word of God but
[1:41:46] uh what is it doing for me it's letting
[1:41:49] you know yourself
[1:41:51] just letting you know who you are
[1:41:53] you're getting more authority of knowing
[1:41:56] the power of a predestinated seat that
[1:42:00] was predestinated from the roots that
[1:42:03] you don't need to be shaky and wondering
[1:42:05] Paul puts it this way he said now even
[1:42:08] if your own heart starts to condemn you
[1:42:10] God is greater than your heart
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:14] the word says Who You Are
[1:42:16] doesn't matter anymore
[1:42:18] it's you're too late now you can't turn
[1:42:21] back this has started from since before
[1:42:23] the foundation of the world and you're
[1:42:26] not going to go now and and what can you
[1:42:29] do to that I'm glad let the musicians
[1:42:31] come I'm so glad that I'm a part of
[1:42:34] God's whole plan of what he's doing in
[1:42:37] this day and in this time and I give him
[1:42:39] praise and honor and glory amen
[1:42:43] predestinated from the root just think
[1:42:45] upon it during the rest of the week
[1:42:47] going to the into those wonderful
[1:42:50] sermons
[1:42:52] works as Faith Express

[1:43:02] and see now that when you say I'm
[1:43:06] growing in faith
[1:43:08] amen
[1:43:10] it doesn't mean that you're you you're
[1:43:12] getting more faith than you ever had it
[1:43:15] just means you're getting more
[1:43:16] enlightened
[1:43:19] and that is causing you to see the world
[1:43:22] and believe more of the word because
[1:43:24] you're being enlightened amen praise the
[1:43:27] Lord and we thank God for that that will
