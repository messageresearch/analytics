Assembly of one another even as the time approaches so that means also that please you can be sit it that means that where two or three are gathered in my name I'll be there amen so it doesn't matter how many people are we you obeying the word of God that said you should not forsake their St of yourself even as the manner of stus when the time approaches okay without wasting much time we're going to read our scriptures um it's Philippians chapter 4 verse 3 to8 um but anyway I'm going to read the whole Philippians chapter 4 whil we going along the line okay you got it okay Philippians 3 I think I read from verse four rejoice in the Lord and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing B in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made unto God and peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any praise think on these things so I might titled the thought of God okay let's pray oh our Heavenly most gracious Eternal God we thank you for making a way for us to be here first of all we ask for forgiveness of our sins if anyone of us has done anything wrong during the day dear Lord we not mean it oh god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob the blood of Christ cleanse us from all unbelief father I invite your presence today Lord tonight come and speak to us once more we give you thanks we give you praise we give you the glory and the honor father we thank you for bringing our pastor and his wife s pom safely may you continue to strengthen them and bring them back to us on Sunday be with brother Kofi and Paul bring them home safely tomorrow and Lord as B desmon is preaching your word tomorrow may you go before him and take him aside and manifest yourself through him Lord over here we commit the service into th hand we bring every Spirit under the control of the Holy Ghost any contrary Spirit you cast it out May the great Holy Ghost have prance bless your children Lord come and speak to us in the call of the evening once more Lord I pray that you let the words of my mouth meditations in my heart be acceptable onto the my king and my redeemer father without you we cannot do nothing Lord we invite you to come and open the pages of the word and bless everyone who could not come today the deacons be with everyone of them from BR Dany to BR Tim and BR Christopher bless wherever they are Lord may your great Holy Ghost bless all of them we thank you and we love you in Jesus name amen praise God please be seated yeah so the word of God says that in chap um Philippians 4:4 say rejoice in the the lord always and again say rejoice that means that no matter what condition you find yourself you have to rejoice in the Lord when you rejoice in the Lord a part of all worship God needs to be worshiped you see when we came here we are coming here to what to worship God if we are supposed a baseball game or be Raptors game You' be screaming and shouting you see what I mean and the football game in soccer in in Premier League when they score they they scream so we are here in the house of God God wants us to worship him I know that Canada the spirit here is a little bit conservatives but we are not Canadians we are not Americans we are not from Africa we are Christians so we are here to Worship the Lord it doesn't matter what you have gone through during the day let's put all aside and let's concentrate our heart on God don't let nothing hinder you tonight forget about yourself forget about what you went through tonight forget about anything that happen in the in the on the job site you are here with one purpose to worship our Lord Jesus Christ don't let nobody hinder you from worshiping him because our purpose is to worship God God created us to worship him there was no any other reason you were created to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm going to read just little quote here and go ahead with it in um 59 11:21 it says that do I love him is my is my love sufficient for him have I loved and put him first when I wake up at morning do I first thing do the first thing I do praise him in other words when you wake up in the morning do you rejoice in the Lord you praise God for give you another day that's what he asking all through the day do I praise him in my decisions do I ask myself is it your will Lord do do I really put him first in everything does he come first if he does let's just sing again and think of it in other words let's put God first let's give him praise let him glory and the honor let's worship Our God he deserves to be worshiped it doesn't matter what you go through you got to worship God the greatest thing that could happen to anyone of us is the Salvation of our souls money cannot buy money is good money can do all things but it cannot give life money cannot give you Joy cannot give you happiness cannot give you peace of Peace but God himself the Lord Jesus Christ the peace of God it passes all understanding so God has given us the most things that money cannot buy so we have to be most happiest people on the face of this Earth it doesn't matter what you go through we should go with happiness and joy in our hearts in Proverbs it says that um I think Proverbs 1513 let I just want to say exactly how it says over there Pro Proverbs 153 a mer heart make a cheerful continence but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken that means that you are marrying your heart your countenance will change people will see how can it be happying you how can how those will hear because it begins from your heart it begins in the morning when you wake up you got to praise God no matter what how late you are say thank you Jesus I praise your name I'm blessed I'm blessed I'm blessed I'm blessed every day that I live I'm blessed when I wake up in the morning till I Lay My Heart to rest and blessed this shouldn't be just a song to it should be a life that we are living as Christians that we are blessed by the Lord Jesus Christ he's given us our health he's given us a place to lay ahead he's given us our family he's given us so many things we deserve to worship him we deserve to glorify thy name oh man he deserve to be praised you know people pay money to go to psychiatrists just to scream but you are privileged just praise God and thank God praise Him 24 hours Worship the Lord with all your heart the thing of it is listen God does not share his office of worship with anyone he alone deserve to be worshiped that's why he cast Satan from Heaven because he being a creation of God wanted to receive worship and God hated that so he cast him out and anyone who says a man of God whatever it is and try to take worship something is wrong somewhere amen because God deserves her to be worshiped I don't care how much Miracles how much that person said he's a man of God if you allow people to bow down to him if you allow to receive worship something is wrong because in the Bible nobody receive worship only Jesus Christ only God here is your Lord God is one God he alone deserves to be worshiped and the thing of it is if you worship God in heaven you worship him down here amen our worship didn't started just over here it started up if you are in the sight of Michael if you're on the site of Michael and you worship god with Michel you automatically worship God that's why God tried to bring it to job's memory he said where were you when the Sons and Daughters of God shout for joy that was in heaven that's what you were doing there amen better here on Earth you go to First Timothy 2:11 28 um Paul was also was saying over there he said that unto the king First Timothy 2:8 sorry First Timothy 2 1 Timothy 1:17 now unto the king eternal Immortal invisible the only wise God be honor and Glory forever and ever amen he deserves our worship he deserves to be glorified we deserve to be Praise on Earth here because we did it back then if you worship him as he tried to let job recognize that that when job was out there he was worshiping God so he tell me where were you where s God Sons and Daughters of God worship God sing praise onto God I was there amen you were there amen when you sing and shout for Joy so a son or daughter of God that's a Seed of Abraham the Bible said that Abraham never staggered at the promise of God but he was constantly praising God giving glory to God so it doesn't matter what condition you are in tonight it doesn't matter what situation you face as a Seed of Abraham you have to give praise to God you have to glorify we have to exalt him because he deserves our worship he deserves to be glorified don't look at your conditions and don't look at because your conditions does not change your position your position is a son or daughter of the Living God it those things are temporary it all came to pass none of them came to say so a Seed of Abraham a true bride of Christ will worship God no matter what situation they go through no matter what they are feeling no matter what their eyes are seeing no matter what condition they find themselves in they will worship the true Living God they'll give him praise they'll give him the glory they'll lift up your hands and say thank you Jesus you alone deserve to worship I lift up your name on high I glorify th name I exalt you you are the same yesterday today and forever there is none like him there's none before him there's none after him his name is the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he had never lost a battle he's a physician that never lose a patient he's oh a lawyer that never lost a case his name is Dr Jesus Christ he's my king he's my Lord he's my everything so I'm here to worship God let no one that disturb you let no one take it away from you either you the devil like I'll worship God Amen I'll worship him in the night in the morning in the evening every time I worship my King Jesus because he deserves to be worshiped he deserves to be glor glorified Hallelujah he doesn't share his glory with anyone only him deserve to be worshiped Hallelujah that's why you could check in the Bible um Peter and Barnabas when God used them to heal those people to heal that sick woman whoever that insane person was they wanted to worship them they did everything they called him God of Jupiter God of this and they cast themselves and they refuse it bluntly because they are human being they are they are Saints children of God saved by the grace of God they are creation of God so they won't accept the worship and none of them nobody no man of God receive worship even in Revelation Chapter 19 Verse the Bible stud this we're going to talk a lot 1910 and he said I fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant and of thy breing they have the testimony of Jesus worship God for the testimony of Jesus is a spirit of Prophecy so nobody God res his office of worship for himself not for anybody else so no matter what you go through no matter what situation you are in you got to worship God you have to love God so much that when he asked him for something and he said yes we worship you you going to praise him even if he said no there shouldn't be a difference because he knows why he said no and if you are a season son or daughter of God you recognize that even though he know is good because all things work together for good to them that love God so all those things in the end will come and work for your good so you have to worship God regardless the problem of it that's why he said that count your blessings and name them one by one it will surprise you what the Lord has done for you the children of Israel they made a big mistake that's why only Joshua and Caleb was able to go to the promised land out of millions why those people did not forget what God did for them God by his grace and mercy he had told them to apply the blood when I see the blood I'll pass over you that types a token and all those who did not apply the blood their first born even doesn't matter if you are children of Israel you are Israelite and you killed that lamb you did everything if you not apply it on your Lamb on the on the door poost that angel of death will kill your firstborn son and God delivered them out of that all the Egyptian first born and they died but the children of Israel God preserved them but you remember when they got into the Red Sea they forgot what God has done for them because they saw all that their eyes was seen by cor was the Egyptians Army coming and the rest in front of them and they were stopped in the middle so they thought we are dead Moses why do you bring us here why didn't leave us to go go back and Le our garlic you see God said I'm bringing you to what a Promised Land a land full of honey and milk but when they got into that situation they forgot what God has done for them but the TR true seed of God Joshua and Caleb among them they remember what God has done and Jose and Moses told the the the the crowd he said be still and know the salvation of God for this Egyptians that you see them you will see them no more God is great he delivered them and let them walk on the bare food in between the Red Sea How great is our God how great is his worth how great is he amen How Great Is Our God how great is his worth he's the greatest one that ever lived he rode back the mighty Red Sea and said follow and on I will lead you he R back the Red Sea and they passed through what an experience what an experience some of us had in our lives see God call us God has done take so much mountains delivered us from so many things some from droughts some from humanizing some from this some from so many things that God has brought us out some of us on the best on the best on the death on on B death God came and rescue us delivered us from accidents do so mighty work to us and when a little problem comes you begin to bow down you begin to cry begin to forget what God has done for us in the the past go back to your experience remember what God has done for you in the past some experiences that nobody can take it from you if you a true bride of Christ God gave you some some points some points certain things happen in your life that you know that you know that it was God that came in that situation and if you have that experience just think on those think on those don't think about the bad stuff don't think about your your downside don't think about when you are down don't think about when you lost the battles think about when you won the battles let us Samson did when he was in a when Samson was in that situation and things were so bad to him he remembered what God has done to him and he think on those things and so God you've done this you've done this for me we repented and when he repented he got a victory is that right so that same God is here tonight count your blessings name them one by one it will surprise you What the Lord Has Done For You amen so what am I saying that we should always think on the positive things the good things things that the Lord has done for us amen praise our God our God is good okay I'm going back to the next verse verse five it said Philippians 45 be careful with vers 5 let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made unto God that means that we have to give God thanks and bring our request to him Our God has never changed he's the same yesterday today and forever he will never leave us nor forsake us if prayer will bring God down why don't you pray pray pray Daniel did prayer and supplication in other words sometimes you become self centered sometimes we become we think only of ourselves Lord give me this Lord give me that Lord give me that it's good but let's go to God with supplication let's go and give him thanks let's go and worship god let's give him praise let's repent of our sins let's put things together and when you've done all that let's put other people first pray for one another pray for your brethren pray for the needs of others Abraham interceded for his cousin Lord let's intercede for one another once sometime you don't know even what people are going through but just pray for them anyhow pray for one another and as you pray for one another and you think on other people it comes back to you unconsciously your needs are even met without even mentioning anything because why you have put others first Jesus Christ came to live for you you and me he never live for himself because of you and me he came to shed his blood for you and me so he came to live for you let's live for others Christianity is not living for yourself it's all based on living for others amen I'm going to read this quote about prayer then I continue okay in uh be certain of God paragraph 21 it said that what we need today is not a lot of material things we have that we don't need greater churches we don't need greater congregations we don't need more on Radio and on television we don't need so many more of these things but what we need today to be spiritual is a person that will humble themselves before God if they don't have if they haven't got a penny and will pray till that Spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of God and a Revival takes place on the inside of your heart that changes their attitudes and atmosphere that they live in you might not have a pair of shoes on on your feet you might be dressed in racks but something in your heart singing The Melodies of God are rather have it than all the man in the world be setting of God you got to beetled of God it doesn't mean that there's anything bad with me money money is good if you know how to use it if you have the character to manage it because now you have the character you can use money wisely but the emphasize is not on money the emphasize is how the only way you can communicate with God is through prayer so that's the only way you can have that relationship with God pray pray pray pray there's one thing you can sing too much you can preach too much you can do but you can never pray too much I wish I therefore a man pray everywhere lifting up holy hands and giving thanks to God Amen so we have to pray we have to set time aside and pray because remember when you set time aside to prayah said before you even go there that angel of God is meeting you over there as you have set time to be he here to preach the gospel to be here 7:30 before we get here God is there already it's up to how much you can believe all things are possible to them that believe it's not about me it's about you making your heart right to receive your need so God is here already so when you set some time apart to pray God will meet you there I know a prayer a Christian pray every everywhere lifting up holy hands praising God as he said in the beginning we pray all the time but we have also to have a quiet time with the Lord after all the days job when we are tired so many busy you need to calm down find some quiet place some quiet place and pray and put your burdens onto God the problem you have is that we try to do it by ourself God is interested in everything about us there's nothing too small for God as we read over here before do you consider God in all your decisions making during the day do you commit yourself to the Lord Jesus Christ do you allow him to take control over your life you have to commit everything into God's hands he's interested in everything said that that the song said that um it says the song said that um there's a song that said that what a privilege is to carry Everything To God In Prayer what a friend we have in Jesus what a privilege to carry everything not something Everything To God In Prayer prayer and leave it there prayer is important prayer is the things that connect us with God but the problem of Fai is sometimes some of us when we pray it become onesided we have to commune with God communion is two people talking and talking back when you cry to God quiet down and let him speak back to you because like you having Fellowship that and I'm the only one talking then that Fellowship will not go because one sided when I talk I'll need you to talk back to me so that's what God expects let's pray to him and let's hear him what he wants us to do he will speak to you one way or the other so let's commun with our maker let's give him an opportunity let him have preeminence pray pray pray prayer is the engine the source of The Engine House engine room for the house for the church let let's pray for the service let's spend time as B said don't just come to church before you can pray up and if you pray that will receive your need because Jesus Christ is here to speak your needs into existence you pray you prayed and you are fire up and I pray that I'm fire up you don't need the s that we don't have to hustle because we already in the spirit and everything will flow nobody has to struggle because everything is in place our God is an awesome God let's go back to the basics pray every day read your Bible and listen to the tapes as brother Jo Smith said one time even 20 minutes a day on the tapes will make a difference let's find time for that let's listen to the Tes let's read our Bible let's pray every day God will take control over the rest seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness all other things shall be added unto you let's put the kingdom first that's one time Peter asked him we have left our mother father friends everything and follow you what are you going to do I said there's no one that has left mother father sister uncle and followed me that will not be blessed in this world and the world to come God keep all his appointment he keeps all his promises he will never fail you or me he's a living God God honors his word more than his name so once we obey his word he become obligated to that word that we are obeying he's the same yesterday today and forever how God never changed How I Love Jesus because he first loves me he's my father he's my father he's my mother he's everything to me he means so much to me our God is awesome God God he's here to bless you he's there to give you the desires of your heart but you have to speak you have to because listen the child that cries most he get what he needs samel braam said that if you walk it the first time doesn't go you whack it again and walk it again and work it again until you get what you need never give up we have come so far it doesn't matter what you go through don't ever give up if you try the first time doesn't go try it again again again and believe it don't doubt that's why he said in that said I I I therefore that a prayer I therefore that a man pray everywhere lifting the holy hands without what doubting if there's a little doubt it will not come to pass let's doubt our doubt now and let's believe God he's God that never changes amen he's the same yesterday today and forever we serving a living God his name is the Lord Jesus Christ he loves you he loves me he died for you he died for me if it was not him where will he have been where will he spend eternity what God has done for us is too much it's too many we can't pay him back we are here to worship him for what he has done for us we have to give him praise and the honor because the reason why he created us is to worship him nothing else no wonder that slave man he said that I don't want any crowns I just want to see his face and worship Him 24/7 because man the Angels they cannot even understand because they have never fall oh but we son or daughter of God who was fall into this flesh and being Redeemed by God he knows where he was lost he knows where he has been when we give God praise even the angels cannot be understand because go what we have gone through and God bring us back we appreciate him more we give him more thanks and praise and the angels who have never sin they worship God 24 hours the chobs and the sarapin when Isaiah was in the presence of God he saw them holy holy God Almighty they worship what about this if you worship him about them you have to worship him here amen 24 hours doesn't matter what our God is good amen praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah and the problem of faith is sometimes is our approach to prayer because God never changed he will never give someone ice cream and when you come he'll give you different if you come the same way the scripture said that Elijah was a man subject to like passion like you and I he made mistake he has his temper he has that but the Bible said he prayed earnestly that should not rain in the span of three and a half years it never rain he prayed again and and Rain came earnestly means that he prayed sincerely if we go to God and prayed sincerely I believe whatever you have need of he will grant it to us he will surprise you he will do things that you never even thought of our God is wonderful amen he's the same God who has never changed hallelujah praise God and I I used to call this the verse eight braam said those are the thoughts of God in the Philippians chapter 4: 8 because remember that any thought that pass through your mind that is contrite the word of God is from Satan and if it's in the line of God's word is God those are God's thoughts and the devil's thought but the greatest battle ever forth is going on even right now even is the mind yes it's going the mind even as the word is going forth it's up to you you have that ability to accept or reject God gave us Choice he never create us and make us like a Dy he gave us a choice so your choices will lead you to your final destination so even right now you can choose to accept the word of God and have your freedom and have your deliverance or you can choose to reject it and stay in your condition it's your choices Jesus Christ was to be here he cannot heal you because he di he done away in know 2,000 years ago when he died on Calvary he was wounded for your trans he was bruised for your iniquity the chastisement of his peace was upon you and with stripes you were healed is done deal it's up to you to accept or reject so your acceptance will bring your healing your acceptance will bring your financial Deliverance your acceptance will bring whatever you have in of tonight if you reject it you can't get it so it is somebody was asking me oh some you can't think the way he wants to think those are not your thoughts if you accept them that it becomes yours one brother was saying that he said Satan I send it back to Jehovah Witness where he came from that is not my thought I a son of the Living God God created me and God is my father so I accept God's s so that's why I said whatsoever things that are of good report whatsoever things that are true whatsoever things that are honest whatsoever things that are just whatsoever things that are pure whatsoever things that are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue think on these things amen and bra brah said over here see um paragraph 111 greatest battle ever fought see it's your mind that opens the door or closes the door and listen to your conscience listen to your memory listen to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God Spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the staff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there is nothing standing there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that no say he cannot battle against it now we know his truth in other words when you place the word of God in your heart no devil can battle against that Christians cancel is not the matter of matter not your thought that bring but the word of God goes through the channel of your thought and create everything let you have your what Deliverance so place that word of God by listening the T by praying every day and let God have the preeminence and brother that a man cannot even sin unless he get himself out of the presence of God when you take yourself from the presence of God when you are not conscious that's why David said I always Place God in front of me in psalm 16 he's always conscious of God when you are conscious of the Living God nothing nothing can penetrate through so let's place the word of God and think on the things that are true those good reports think on them give God thanks count your blessings name them one by one it will surprise you what the Lord has done for you if there's anything that I wanted to Grant here tonight that let's remember what God has done for us he has done so much for us you are privileged I was just thinking about it today myself that by the grace of God when this word of God was presented to me in the midnight around 12:1 when I saw the way the God was using the prophet to heal the people something I unor in my heart if Jesus Christ was to here that's the way you'll be healing the people it was a grace of God that came to your door it's grace of God millions are perishing they don't have a clue what is going on but you by the grace of when Christ was here in that time when those he was on the donkey people were worshiping him they were asking who is this majority of the people missed that that time and majority are missing it even this time but you and me by the grace of God when this word was presented to you something in you which is God himself accepted it and is that said the Lord so you should be the most happiest people on the face of this Earth regardless of any circumstances regardless of any anything that comes your way our God is matching on let's match on the word of God let's give him thanks let's give him praise let give him the honor and the glory because he deserve to be worshiped he deserves our worship he deserves Our Praise he has done so much for you and me so let's not forget what God has done for us like the children of Israel they didn't have a short memory they couldn't make it but it's getting to a time it's not about you or me he himself has done it already because all that the father has given me will come to me all that you have to do is be simple and leave a simple Christian Life and God will make the difference God will take control over the situation because he take care of every situation don't worry don't get flustered don't look at the condition don't look at the economic condition don't look at anything else look to Calvary look to Jesus look at him he came he didn't have to go through that they smack him they spit on his face they did all kind of things for him but he said father forgive them they didn't know what they are doing that was for you and me they were blinded so that you and I can get in what a privilege what God has done for us is beyond any human compar let us remember that and worship him every day and give him thanks no matter what you go through in life remember none of them came to pass none of them came to stay it will pass it came to pass it will come to pass it's never going to stay so no matter what you find yourself in tonight on the Streamline in here remember God what he has done for you and he's still doing the same thing he's the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God then um verse Philippians I'm still on the Philippians verse 11 okay verse 10 but I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at last your care your care of me had flourished again wherein you were also careful but you la opportunity now that I speak in respect of one for have learned in whatsoever State I am there with to be content I know both how to be AB based and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I'm instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and both to suffer need in other words Paul was trying to say that no matter what condition comes his way he is not worried he's content whatever comes his way he believe God will take take care of the situation he knows how to be high how to be low he has gone through all that because remember every life experience there's nobody that have his life all straight forward all like that all the time it's like a stock market it's like you go up you go down like that that's all life is nobody can have it 100% like that we all go through our down times you go through our High Times you go through are good times there a god of the good times and God of the bad times every time God is good so when you are in the bad times or you good times you have to be content because God will bring you out he will let all things work together for good to them that love God that's the God that you are you are serving he's a living God he's only wise God he's Eternal the Prince of Peace Mighty God Everlasting father before him there is no other God neither will there be any other God after him he is God that never lose a battle amen so whatever situation you find yourself in you got to be content you have to be happy because God is going to bring you out it's it didn't not going to be for forever amen praise God hallelujah and one more thing he said that it said over here verse verse 13 He said that I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me that means that it's not by power by might but by my spirit says the Lord we can do all things through Christ yesterday I was telling some girl that I met in a place we went to buy something and she has a tattoo on her he said that she can do all things I said it's good that you have that positive thing you can do all things is good because you you are what you speak of or you become what you eat or whatever that positive is very good thing but I told her the difference between what I believe is that in Philippians I can do all things through Christ who what strength in other words we have come to a place and realize it's not by our own power it's not by our own might it's not how much we have studied it's not how much we know it's not how much we have done all those things it's all about him who strengthen us without God we are nothing without him our worship in vain without him coming to vindicate everything we doing is in vain he is the center of our life he's our everything him in our life make the difference him in your life make the difference when Christ coming it takes it makes a difference of everything because we are nothing without him he can do without us we cannot do without him that's why I said that God is able to what raise souls for Abraham to worship him if you try to think that you are too much or whatever that you think that you have done things then you're going to take himself out and tell you do it let me see so in everything we do we cannot do it without him without him I cannot do nothing without him I'll be drifting like a ship without a seal but with him I can do all things just say to I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me say say back to me Str I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me I can do all things through Christ who strengthened me amen let's keep that in our heart throughout the week and know that no matter what situation we are facing we can do it through Christ not by might not by power but by my spirit says the Lord remember it was not Moses who was do it was God in Moses it was never Samson but it was God in Samson it wasn't even brother abrah how can he uneducated seven years do all these things can know the people can know this and all that it wasn't him it was God it's Christ he said Willam Braham have loan me his body his mouth his mind everything and I come to do the things it's not not him it's I doing it so is you and me if we are so too much surrounded and give our mind our soul conscious everything the Living God he will come in us and do Mighty Works in our lives he's the same yesterday today and forever all those who became prisoner of Christ and gave God their conscience gave him their heart gave him everything he came in and surrendered and live through them and do Mighty Works through them he's doing the same time he's the same thing the same God that was in Moses that was in the prophet is in you and in me and it it's all up to you how you make the step because he said that everywhere Jack that your footsteps I have given it to you the Lord has given everything footsteps mean possession because God is with you even in you until what the consumation of the time he's in your heart he's in my heart he lives in me he lives in you he's the same God by all things work together for good to them that love God no matter what God is in control amen he is in control of my life life how God is so great I feel so good I feel the pole Hallelujah my God is good my God is awesome hallelujah amen hallelujah you can do all things through Christ who strengthen us what am I saying when you are in the post of Duty when you are doing something and you know that your motive is right and your objectiv is right just go on and do it God will make a way for you but he the same God you see when Joshua was in the post of Duty and he needed stand he said stand stand still and stand too still Joshua is not better than you he's a Son of God like you are so what am I trying to say when you are in the post of Duty you needed something just speak to the Rock and go forward Moses did it he said he lift up his th his rod and the rest SE departed and he obey him Elijah prayed and ly and reain did not came for three and a half years he prayed again rain came Daniel when he and the post of Duty in the Lion's then braam said that God send that Pillar of Fire around him so that the Lions could not get close to him and God protected him the Hebrew children what happened to them they said that our God is able to deliver us but even if you chose not to we're not going to bow down to this thos so it's you and me we have confidence we have seen God so much and we know he can do so many true thre but even if you chose not to we are not going to bow down to the devil we are not going to bow down to the situation you're going to stand in and see the salvation of God so I encourage you tonight don't give up no matter what trust God once you are in the post of Duty once your motive is right that's why you're not going to be stupid like to go and take poisons to drink or somebody who just went to um Lions then to prove that he can we we don't tempt God but if you go to some place you pray over the food and you eat even there's poison it to not poison you because the Bible said in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall lay their hands on the sick they shall recover they will eat poisons and what it will not harm them so you on the post of Duty you eat and go forth because remember it's not what goes into your mouth that defil a man is what comes out from the man yes come from the mouth or the man so you don't have to be scared of anything you bless the food and you go so once you are on the post of Duty don't be scared it doesn't matter what the situation just move forward because because God is with you even in you until the consumation of the time he'll be there for you he will make a way where it seems to be no way he's the same God you you you tell me when Elijah went to that woman's house who did not have oil every day since Elijah left the oil was being filled who was filling that oil where did he get that oil from you tell me how the Ravens able to get food and feed him you can't explain so many things but God did it how did those face multiply how did this how did all those things happen our God is a living God and God is marching on so God can do all things sometime you look to ourself too much we look to our own abilities what I can do but if you can get to that place that we take our own self out our own abilities out what we can do out and concentrate and Believe on what God can can do Miracles so many things will happen in our lives one time I remember I came to service and Pastor preach on one Wednesday I was so carried in the spirit so blessed I can't explain it I went downstairs Johnson told me he has a problem with his leg I put my hands I prayed he she came and gave a testimony that the pain everything just left I went the following day I went to meet a client a builder and he's a denomination guy we spoke and the spirit of the Living God anointing filled the whole place and and that inspiration I went to square one then I saw a lady the escalator that time they put a stop on it a lady was sitting there she said she can't walk and they calling ambulance they security commotion was going on there there was one brother that goes to BR Michael as he was there didn't then he took the woman's H purse then I asked her do you believe in God she said yes do you believe God can heal you she said yes and we prayed and with a plate of second one two she just woke up and didn't need ambulance who did that the same God is here tonight so whatever you have need of just get into his presence remember that the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life we need both the mechanics and the Dynamics the scriptures when the spirit of truth comes he he will lead you to all truth and show you things to come so we need both the word and the spirit but the Pentecostals have just spr spr spr spr Spirit and the message people have beening the word word word word but it's the spirit that quickens so you need both both mechanics and Dynamics and move on because without the Dynamics it will not work but when the spirit quickened that letter becames life it gives life the life comes out of it because remember you need the revelation of the word not just the letter the revealed world that's what the devil cannot fight against it when that word is become revealed in your heart and then you put it to PL because remember the evidence of the Holy Ghost is to be able to ability to receive the word for your day and what go leave it so it's not just the mechanics it's not just the knowledge it's not just recognizing it it's acting living on what you are because I us tell people I was telling somebody last week it's not how much you know of the letter that's important but even if one word that has been revealed to you and you able to leave it that's most important thing because he who that knows much much is required of him so whatever that you know God expects you to leave what you have received so it's not the accumulation of all the knowledge but just the PA that has been revealed to you you're going to give account to it and the whole thing is it comes back to the grace of god let's stand for him and he will stand for us just like after m one the Evangelist that went into the presence of God one right time and then they asked him after my did you ever steal was on Earth he said in the presence on Earth I thought I never steal but the presence of that light little things that I do it magnified did you lie he thought I never lied but in the presence of that it all shows up and then he said oh I'm a v i leave Millions then I'll I'll I I try my case in the white Throne of judgment if I have no choice then he said he heard the sweetest voice the sweetest name he said father he stood for me on Earth I'm also standing for him so let's stand for Christ let's stand for him he will stand for us it's not the law so how much you obey the Lord not how much but God is looking to Your Heart The Desires in your heart what you want to do what's hiding there what you are Desiring he know we make mistakes he knows this flesh can never be perfect but he's looking into your heart he's looking to your stand for him that's why the Bible said that even said if your heart condemns you God is greater than your heart and if your heart condemns you not whatever you ask God he'll Grant it to you once there's a comination you can't go back even if your heart condemns you God is greater than your heart and it goes say said that the seed of God cannot sin because what he has the seed of God in him a child of God cannot because he has what the seed of God in him so you cannot s and some David said that blessed is the man whom I will not impute sin whose iniquity is Forgiven if you read that Isaiah chapter uh 5 said he was wounded for what your transgression in transgressing the law he knows you cannot obey the law you cannot follow the law but all that he wants is that let's give him the heart Let Him Live his life through US BEC simple don't want to walk with any guilt around you because he died on Calvary your sins were put in God's sea of forgetful you have Justified as if you have never even done it that's how Grace God has given it to us so let's work with confidence relying on God's ability not your own works of righteousness by his works of righteousness there's no one perfect but the perfect God lives in you that makes you perfect because he alone is perfect when the cry went out who is worthy to take the seals and break it off there was no one Worthy holy Christ the Lamb of God who was worthy to take the seals and break it off he is worthy he's
