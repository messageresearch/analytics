TRANSCRIPT
========================================
father I pray God that if you've done anything wrong forgive everyone of us may your presence be here may you speak may you bless the hearers as well as the speaker we commit the remainder of the service Lord into thy hand we bound any contrary Spirit anything that will hinder your flow of spirit will come against it in the name of Jesus may your spirit have flow have remnance and bless everyone here father oh I pray in the name of Jesus no one need the same but you draw them Father closer to yourself in Jesus name amen please be seated hallelujah amen so if I will title this I'll title it to be um Victory after trials or trials before Victory and in every life especially become a Christian you go through trials because a Christian work is not a flowy bed of Peace you have your trials I have my trials but the thing of it is when you get into any trials you as a Christian as individual you have to search your heart and find out why you have been in that situation of your life why am I in this trial there are so many reasons why we get ourselves into trials but I'm going to talk only about three of them and the one that I focus on is the third one mostly but the first one is some trials we go through we bring it upon ourselves it's because of our own unbelief our own doing it gets us into a place that brings some trials and tribulations in our life that it shouldn't have been the first place is because of our own doing that's why the scripture said let a man examine himself if he is in the faith the Bible tell to examine someone examine your own self and see because you have to be praying not um daily but you have to be praying even hour every time you have to be in the presence of God when you get out from the presence of God and you get your eyes and your your objectiv shifted so so long a time sometimes most of the time we get ourselves in trouble so so it's your own doing that bring some trials and persecutions in your life and when you become a Christian is a very um critical you got to watch your work you got to watch what you doing because as a true Christian as a Christian your actions it will affect you it's going to affect your children and it can even affect the movement of the spirit in the church because the sin of a affected the whole Camp so we walking on a treadmill especially when it's getting very close it's getting more closer each and every day so it's up to you as individual to examine and check your life all the time so if you get in tral and you realize that it's your own bringing then you got to repent M you got to make things right with the person and everything you s against somebody you got to go to the person make it right it's something with God you make it right with God then the thing is settled and the second trials that comes to our life sometimes the enemy the devil trying to push us around so you got to watch just like job when he was in a trial he searched his life he said and even made a sacrifice for his children to make sure that it's not something that his children has brought onto him but when he realized that it wasn't any one of them what I'm saying is that when you get in trouble you get into trouble you get into tribulation you get into any trials and you know that is not your own doing but you realize that a devil trying to make you miserable uncomfortable this world then you got the power in Jesus name to cast him out right because the scripture said that you shall cast out devils in my name which is unbel so you have the power in Jesus name to cast that out from your family to cast it out from you and be free to serve your living God because the spirit of Christ is in you so you got authority over everything that the devil tries to bring to you so you cast that out in Jesus name and the third one which uh I'm going to base all my thoughts on my everything on is the trials that Believers have not because he has done anything wrong just like J it was God proving that I have confidence in my servant Jo amen so when your walk is right with the Lord Jesus Christ and you do everything right then sometimes God could say this my son is's adopted he can face every situation Hallelujah so he allow or permit the enemy to bring trials and tribulations in your life but he knew that he has confidence in you praise God that confidence has because he know that that word of Christ in you so without God revelation of God's word in you he know you stand by that and overcome every trials so with that confidence he permit things to come your way and in our scripture Abraham was our example and without going into details Abraham is not only the natural Seed of Abraham as Seed of Abraham you are a royal SE of Abraham because you have the same faith that Abraham had so in talking about it I won't have time to go back and forth but far I'm talking about Abraham you apply yourself in the in his shoes because you are you have the same faith that Abraham has amen okay so Abraham before not Abraham went into the trials with Isaac here that you read he after he has received the Holy Ghost which is a type of circumcision after the circumcision then you have this Tri so that's the Bible said that gri not the Holy Ghost until you are un until you which you are sealed until the day of your Redemption so when you become a Christian is not when you become a Christian it's not a FL bed of e I'm going to read this here he said and sometimes we have more troubles when you become a Christian than we did when we were Sinners because it is written many is the afflictions of the righteous but God deliver him from them Allen God promised many afflictions strange feelings and strange things that will be beyond our understanding it's always done for our good we just can't understand it because if we did then it will not be a Fai to us we will go with an understanding we will go with an understanding but we do it and we have it and you believe by faith his word that that is going to work some good thing for us amen so Abraham had his trials after the circumcision after he received the Holy Ghost it's not before he went through but after and even what God dealing with Abraham the same God dealing with you is not what you have done in the first place because God gave the condition to Adam that if you do this I do this but in Abraham his promise for him was unconditional promise so it's a Believer you your deing with God is not because of what you have done not how much good you are not how much you can leave [Music] [Applause] this Sanctified life or anything of that Stu but it's the netive life God L you more than you can even think of and because he loves you he allow you to go through all but whom I love I reuke and ITI so the love of God is beyond your measure so when you go through all those trials in said your Tri is like a more like a gold you need it to build your up as a Christian if you don't have those trials you not even know what kind of power what kind of faith that you have your life will be just like that thank you Lord if you are not being attacked by the enemy any angle of your life something is wrong because if you are doing damage into his kingdom he always going to come after you so what I'm trying to say is that if you go through any afflictions don't worry that God is on your part he love you that's why he permitted that to come to your part but he has given us a promise that he will never give you anything that you can can not be in anything that comes your way he will make a way for you there is a way of Escape there's a way that he give you an escape Hallelujah when Joshua made that City of Refuge when you ride to that City there's you get Deliverance no your accusers cannot do nothing to you but now you have the Lord Jesus Christ he is our City of Refuge right so anything that CS your way you go back to him he is there for you he's your City of Refuge the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ any way anything that comes your way our Lord is more than able to bring us out Hallelujah so don't get down that's right face every situation that is up to you sometimes you get to a place situation comes you can't know where to go everywhere seems dark God laughes that way he's looking at your reaction amen not hasn't forsake you nor forget about you but he wants to see how going to react Hallelujah he's said good God isn't it amen and back to that sanctify life as I was saying before that the L of God it goes beyond your moral life if it was only to be a moral good life then said that es was more gentl than Jacob but God chose Jacob because of what love Jacob I love is I hate is intive life and that elective life it brings you to a place is not our own Sanctified life it's not your making because if it was sany life most of us cannot you match the denominations I know why I'm saying that because last Thursday I met a sister he said Pentecostal I took my kids my children to their school um family night when we went there I went by myself and the children I end up into this Pentecostal sister she's dress 100% perfect nothing that you can talk about her and I said wow I like the way that you dress because in this time you don't have so many people who can even dress dist if you look at the par she was one out of the million over there and we began to talk and she was opening up and I said wow how that the Christian is going through pressure even our teenagers for them to even not to be wearing pants they have to go through a lot of pressure at school even even the sisters on the job side they go through pressure because of the way they dress because I was saying as a man when you become a Christian what do the people don't really you don't have much to overcome because of dressing but the CH the woman Tes the church so the man put on suit and everything just like a normal person but the sisters have to constantly go through all those persecution to prove to the world that there's somebody in 2017 here that obey God's way and said judgment to the rest of the world and once we were talking that she said yeah I believe everything that you were saying I baptized at the age of 15 and I drifted a little bit I came back at the age of 18 in Canada and I've been serving God ever since I have a son 16 years and a half 12 and have eight so she's supposed to may be her 40s and she's been serving God for all the time but you see the problem of faith is I tried to go a little bit further to see her reaction and I said it's good our conversation went on very nice said I said have you do you know anything about fulfillment of Malachi 45 said she doesn't know so I right away she has the Bible in the she read Malachi 45 we talk about revelation 10:7 we talk about like the promise for our time because as Pastor said on Sunday you can have all that but if you don't believe this you don't have the oil this is the O for the AG of the you can have all the moral life and all the speaking son and everything all her children have been baptized in the name of Jesus they have done everything right mean but they don't have the oil the oil is what's important give o my keep it bur the oil you receive your word for the day that's the proof that you have which is the Holy Ghost outside that you don't have it so we talk we talk and she never resist anything she read the scriptures and she was so excited and I gave her our website address because like time was going and things were kind of disturbing our conversation so I just gave her a Church website address and voice of God and we kind of end up our conversation but what I'm trying to say tonight is that you are blessed amen you are elected son of daughter of God don't look that on yourself with all the me if the lordus was to be here tonight you were the elected seat if you were to be living back in his time you would have been a class of people and the rest because they recognize the word of God for their day and for you to recognize what God is doing present stage of his ministry don't take it for granted don't take it for granted don't don't let take it lightly it's the most important thing in life to recognize what God is doing that's right present stage amen you are privileged am it's not because of what you have done but because of his elective love amen and love is what is doing it you can't buy this it's not by yourth of righteousness it's not your moral life then M they pray like 7 times a day but what has to them killing people and all that kind understand is the grace of God Amen it's the Sovereign Grace that has brought is all that far and I I just I can go on and on and on because we are privileged people we are people that God has elected one a million for this end time because even on the Victoria Hol day on Monday I went again with my children for a playing Ground nor come to third line here they have a nice playr over there but for some reason I said we're not coming there we just I reach Wiston Churchill let's go and relax over here of my daughters said no that we not coming here we have to go I like up I said no we stand here and then once they were playing over there I just bumped into a man he said his name is j he's been in Canada here not for too long in torto not for too long and he said he love the Lord Jesus Christ but since he came here he's been attending couple of churches so many churches but when he go to those churches there's nothing there for him he said the people they Pastor songs he goes for Fellowship there's no God in their conversation so he's kind of dying then I said the Bible said that there is going to be a farming in the land not for food natural food or drink but for the true word of God and I told him if there was ever a time there is that fing in the land it is now is a present tense there is a fing in the land what we are feeding on is unfailing reality of the Living God but the people out there the domination they don't have even one millions of what you got so you got than God you got to your L you got to be ready you got to ask for the Revival in your heart every day because we living the closing chapters of his coming what God has given to you what have you done are youing with it so precious with it yes it's so precious than anything that go Sil than anything else this is truth we have to give our all you all to it I wonder sometimes we sleeping too long too much I wonder sometimes we the emphas on things that have no value the things that have value Happ those things that money cannot buy only God gives that you can't buy piece of from the supermarket those are the things that are precious to but sometimes to things that have no value those things God will give you to you seeking theom of and all things you whatever to give it to you you put him first you got to put God first in your everything he has to be your he to your everything Hallelujah nothing com ahead of him he able to provide your doesn't matter what the greatest thing happen to Salvation of your soul he has the of your soul he brought you out put of pra Hallelujah

hallelujah God is good isn't it amen he's wonderful his PR of Peace Mighty God Hall able to do everything to youen thank you jesusall hallelujah hallelujah amen and back what I'm saying that Abraham he went through trials is that right and a a true Christian a royal of Abraham you going to have your persecution going to have your own trials and I believe that the pressure that is coming in this time is great is coming every day we living a pressure age pressure for the family pressure for the individual pressure for the government and do you ever ask yourself why are they making all those laws they have one person in mind it's you all the laws have been formed against you as a bride of Christ as Pastor said that one time their enemies me so all those things are against us M and I believe with all my heart that there is this for the Bible said as was in the days of Sodom Andorra so shall it be when the stand of mind is revealed if there was ever a time that the coition in this world in it is now is a fulfillment of that scripture Hallelujah and God is Reve once again the bright form there that fulfillment and the whole world is in condition hallelujah hallelujah I believe the scripture in Luke 23 3 29 let me see Luke 23:29 I WR see I think yeah Luke [Music] 23 yeah yeah 29 he said for behold the day are coming in the which they shall see blessed are the B and the wombs that never bear and the nap which never g s do you think there is ever a time that scpt is fulfilled I believe it's now why saying that I'm going to read this to you apart from right right now with all the G8 and all the countries apart from Canada here and the us all the prime ministers and the president most of them have no children what example I'm going to read to you maon the newly elected French president has no children German counselor Chancellor Angela Merkel has no children British prime minister Teresa may has no children Holland prime minister Paulo jento has no children Italian Prime Minister has no children Sweden stepan Lin no children lber no children SC ni St have also have no children J clo president the European commission has no children and if I believe if somebody is a president or a prime minister he an example that the people look up to and if all these major leaders if they have no children you think if there's going to be a generation to come would the children would they have children because they're looking up to them they said in Germany one out of three College graduates have no children in Canada one out of five have no children in 2011 when they did the census then they recognized that there are more people living as singles more than couples what time are we living in I believe it's a condition because they make the laws and the conditions the land it becomes difficult to raise children why do you think have only two children was the same condition right there over here now it becomes childless Society theys have no children how are they going to make laws to help you raise your children you tell me this is the time we are living in and all the L that they are making is to put pressure on you and me and God loves that he is the god who never changes amen we going to go through the pressure we going to go through the that's I said that I believe the same way the Rapture is a process leading to an event some of the events like the squeeze in it is all a process God allow you to go through this brings you out like to go through this he's preparing you because there's going to be a time that God have that spoken word in you speak and go forward because Moses was brought to that same show down the children of Israel it reach a place they were moving back to Palestine there was the rest in front of them there were no soldiers there was Egypt phy behind nowhere to go have you ever been have a Express in your life and nowhere to tell and then people began to panic and God told Moses Moses the people stand still and see the salvation of the Lord and the Lord told Moses why crying speak and go for it I believe is coming to a time that all that the bride of Christ will have how to speak and go for it amen it's a pressure time it's a pressure the bride of Christ you have to speak and go forward yes you can do by yourself but God in you he's the hope of your glory amen he's going to bring you to a situation to prove to you that he lives inside of you he prove to you that he is inside of you that give you the confidence amen that give you the grace to move on recently I've been going through a lot eating having having that oh man went to a place that even have a food poison and this and that but in the midst of all that the Lord bring us out he brought out from that and he proed himself to me in those situations just in the elevator and I told some somebody that maybe 5 10 people there said somebody we get to a place some was going out have a good day somebody look at me said what you can hide for me there is God inside of you I could see Christ in you I see that you are a great man of God I was trying to D my head my wife was there so many people there why because I was in persecution I was going through trials and I was fing my heart and God has and prove to you and give you those comfort and in that time I could even get to a place and help somebody pray for the person didn't just encourage the person he said God sent you here help me to speak me I so down in a desperate condition so God will show you bring all those things little little here and prove to you that he lives inside of you amen hallelujah he will never leave you no forsake you amen hallelujah God is good isn't it amen of God yes so what am I saying God loves that to bring you to a place and to see your reaction the Hebrew children went through it and they have that confidence and they said we know we believe that God is able to deliver us but if we chose not to we are not going to bow down to those Idols but still God com he watched them and they were stepping up in faith they didn't want they they didn't care they were stepping out stepping out and they went in the fire but God let them over there the fire Jesus Christ amen he there for you don't worry that's why said not be afraid I'm with you why you not afraid because condition over there that put sces on you but he's encouraging you tonight not be afraid I'm there with you I'll be there with you in the midst of all the tribulation he's there with you Hallelujah Joshua he went through that too he was fighting he understand told the stand to stand still and they stand still still when they reach Jero they have to walk seven times Y and God came why Jero they put the ACT first and the ACT is the word of God so in every situation that you face when you put God first that's right he's more than able to bring outu to for Hallelujah God he change he never leave you nor forsake you amen hallelujah amen our God is good isn't it amen praise God hallelujah hallelujah amen you know one thing about all these great um Great Men of God Moses died and elij they all died Joshua they all face the de all these Great Men none of them have solution to death but oh God himself came down in the form of a man he never had it easy because they have a name t even from right at childhood they say it's an illegit child who from hell he was a Son of God he was never what you were talking about him but he has that tag around him he has to go through all that the Bible said that he was tempted in every point and the devil bring him up and tempted him three times and said I'll give you the if you can get hands he knew he's going to fall to that and this Jesus Hallelujah of calary Hallelujah he defeated death he defeated grave he defeated Everything Was Defeated what I'm saying tonight Hallelujah that same God when he de all those things what happened he gave up his spirit and that same God the Holy Ghost came on Peter he came on the apostles and excuse me those Pentecostal that try to make speaking in as the evidence of the Holy Ghost when the pet in the res the people understand them is that right so speak inong understand something is wrong so what I'm trying to say is that Peter John the rest all those Apostles what do you think they did when they found that they recognized that this is the truth they give their life for it that's right and we have to give our life for it my brother you are not going to die they but you are not going to die because the same spirit that ra up Christ if it
