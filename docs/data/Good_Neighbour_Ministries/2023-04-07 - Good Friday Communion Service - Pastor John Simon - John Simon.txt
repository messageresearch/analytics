back we have a visitor it's a coyote it's got pups and we're asking that no children especially but nobody go back there or even hang around in the parking lot tonight and because it does get aggressive if it thinks that it's you know it's been using his motherly instincts so that's not especially children nobody out by themselves and uh into the car and go home tonight all right and we're gonna have to watch it in the next few Services as well give it its time it'll go away all right praise God amen is that Death Michelle all right we're going to invite our pastor to come but let's stand and sing Oh Worthy oh worthy are you Lord worthy to be thanked and praised worshiped [Music] worthy to be thanked and prayed [Music] we worship and adore you we make our praises [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] praise be the god it's good to be here this evening the Lord bless you in a great and wonderful way as our brother has said we've come here with one purpose and that is to memorialize and to celebrate amen this sacrifice that Jesus has made for us so let us not after the service uh hang around you know but just leave and go home especially now that we hear we have this uh beautiful animal in the back but not to be played with um for right now the instincts to protect its own is in it so we have to avoid it for a little while okay so that's important I want you to know also that every one of you who have come to Christ by the grace of almighty God I consider you as my children in Christ uh I consider you as Those whom God has honored me through the years to bring um to your attention his divine presence we know we cannot see him in our eyes but the one whom we feel a bit in our hearts is making himself clearer and clearer every day and I pray that somehow the holy spirit will visit you and let you know the things that I'm saying to you they are true not because I say so because he witnesses to what I'm saying speaking on his behalf for his glory and for his honor so let's look away to Jesus praise the lord we are going to enter into the service uh where the musicians just better stay stand by in other words you can go to your seat but just stand by as I feel moved I'll just call you right uh Our Sister on the musical instrument can stay right there and together let's worship and glorify God okay God bless you we welcome all our visitors we welcome those of you who are with us in our midst I don't know if I'm seeing right is that is that Brandon Michael okay all right I just thought I saw brother Michael lasari but I guess that's age right catching up with you but God is good isn't he let us read our scripture which I'll now give to our brother which would be Matthew chapter 26 reading from verses 26 to 30. yours will be up on the screen and I'll read from the word and as they were eating Jesus Took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drinky all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but I see unto you I will not drink and sport of this fruit of the vine until the day when I drink it new with you in my father's Kingdom praise the Lord our dear loving gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the written word which we have read and we pray that Lord Jesus because we all stand together here without your presence here in our midst this will be just a large group or a gathering of people but father the difference is when you come and be with us on the scene and we can sense and know your presence father and while I bring the word of God uh Lord we invite the Holy Spirit to draw near to us and comfort Us in this hour May the power in the presence of this God's holy spirit minister to us through the word of God and the vessels you have set aside for this hour may you receive glory honor and praise those who have come father with their troubles their trials their suffering their sicknesses May the Holy Spirit minister to them Father they don't need for me to touch them because you are the great physician you are walking up and down these aisles you are moving amongst the candlesticks once more you are here with your people and we ask now father that you will bring everything alive that you may be glorified in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen God bless every one of you please be seated at this particular time as I've said we are here today to observe the Lord's Supper and as we observe the Lord's supper together it's a wonderful opportunity to reflect on the foundations of our faith the foundation of our faith amen praise God we also must think about the depths of our sins because it doesn't matter who we are we reflect and think where we were and where we are where he brought us from and where we are by the grace of God today we ought to reflect also on the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ in paying the Redemption price for our sins let us think so much how that we were all in the devil's pawn shop uh let me turn it another way we were like Pawns in the devil's hands and he just played us as we would use the term in modern terms he just played us around like puppets in the hand of a puppet master uh but thank God while we were in that old antique pawn shop Jesus Christ came and paid the price for us remember the word Redemption means uh the price to buy back something redeem something that you pawned or was lodged with the pawn broker which means that before you you receive that Redemption somebody owned you you are owned already if you're lost you were lost from somewhere where were you where were you when the morning Stars sank together and the sons and dust of God shouted for Joy you see we must understand that we are not just creatures of time we are creatures of Eternity we are Sons and Daughters of the Living God now born by the spirit that we might come to a supernatural awareness of who we really are we are not just Mortals on the Earth but we are the embodiment and of parts of of the Living God we are pieces of the Almighty Christ within our hearts makes us himself alive once more through us for his grace and for his honor amen so the law this Lord's Supper is really uh unifying event that the Lord himself has instituted for us that from time to time when we worship and we seem to drift away from each other in relationship in thoughts and everything else God uses this event to bring a unifying influence upon us that we can bring it together and say we are together again we are here praising the Lord we're giving glory to his name we are all conscious of what he has done for us and we look forward for what he is going to do for us amen thank God not only is this a unifying event but coming together like this is a a living testimony to his Saving Grace that others might know that we are changed we are not what we used to be every one of us can think of ourselves of what we were no matter if you think you were a good boy a good man a good woman somehow when the grace of God comes into your life you are changed you are different your outlook your worldview your your view of the word of God is completely transformed because God changes it by his great power to transform amen so let us celebrate this communion amen are you going to join me are we going to celebrate this together praise the name of the Lord hallelujah so let's take these moments and focus our attention some and Minds upon our lovely Lord Jesus Christ as the song says Look Away to Jesus look away from the things of the world if the disciples had looked away from the storm when they were crossing the Sea of Galilee from one side to the other and he said let's go over to the other side they took the ship the storm came the mass that broken the sails were torn lightning flashing thunder rolling the ship was rocking on every hand amen and then the Bible says their growth soar afraid amen and they went to wake Jesus that should have told them something he just took a pillow and went to sleep while all the storm was going on because he had already told them let's go over he did not say let's go under but he said let's go over on the other side if they had believed him there would not have worried with the with the up the things they are seeing that's why faith is the evidence of Things Not Seen don't look never mind the circumstances the trails the troubles the tribulations the problems that surround you keep your eyes your naturalized the eyes of your mind or your heart keep them keep your thoughts away from that and look to the word of God Look Away to Jesus see Jesus only for this too shall pass you read in the Bible and it came to pass and it came to pass and it came to pass the only thing that stays is Jesus Christ the only thing that is eternal is God himself everything else comes to pass so friends no matter what you may be going through it has come you can't say it's not there but it too must pass away because that's the grace of God that's the word of God to you that God has sent to our hearts amen yes sir praise His Wonderful Name glory to God Amen so as we come like this let us spend some time in prayer because Jesus before he went to Calvary what did he do in the Garden of Gethsemane the Bible tells us that he prayed and he prayed so much that he sweat drops of blood and if he prayed at a time like this immemorial to him when we come together to observe the Lord's supper and we remember that he prayed we should pray also we should pray immemorial to that which he did for us will you take a few moments just bow your head right where you are and whatever prayer you may have in your heart talk to God May the holy spirit of God take his word and bear witness to us that even while this service is in progress Devils that hold you in your mind taking you off your mental balance sickness within your body trouble within your soul will begin to leave you in the midst of the service so that after you leave before you leave and after you leave the spirit of almighty God working within your spirit your body and your soul will completely cleanse you and make you whole as with your hands bowed let us acknowledge his grace and love within our lives let us acknowledge his grace mercy and his long-suffering with this wicked World in which we are living in let us raise our hands and give praise and let us give thanks oh Hallelujah let's give him thanks for who he is who he is to us our savior Our Redeemer or baptizer our soon-coming King his name is wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace the Alpha and the Amiga or praise God forevermore let's give him praise let's give him thanks let's give him glory for who he is to us and who we are to him amen praise be to God hallelujah let us pray for this community and your community wherever you are from neighborhoods Neighbors those around us let us pray for them they may never know that you are praying for them but let your influence of your prayers go out this evening in this Lord's Supper to reach them and touch them until you yourself begin to recognize something has happened within their lives help them Lord may they come to know you and to know your grace and furthermore let us live lives that are worthy of the Gospel before them that they might know that you are real may God help us let us pray that we never take our salvation for granted that we never take it to a place where we belittle the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ so let's come confessing our sins we use a modern term our mistakes let's come confessing our faults not to men like yourself not to me not to any man but to confess it to the Lord Jesus Christ he says when you pray go into your closet close the doors and speak to your heavenly father in secret and your father who hears in secret will reward you openly and as believers we know that we are a part of Elohim the Eternal one you may look up you realize that we are a part of Elohim the Eternal one he is eternal that makes the being that lives in this body named John Simon the person that's speaking to you whom you cannot see but you can see my body but you can't see me that person who speaks to you is a part of the Eternal it's not the Eternal but a part of him I believe I'm a chip off the old block uh or the old rock I believe certainly that I'm a part of that Pillar of Fire that was broken into small pieces and came upon the apostles signifying that God had broken himself up and placed himself within his children amen so we don't have to struggle strain fight to be like him amen because we are like him because he is in us living his own life through us that the world might see who he is by the way he works through the lives of his children amen thanks be to God aren't you happy I'm glad that I'm a part of him and we are here knowing that we are a part of redemption story for this entire Bible from beginning to when it winds up in glory once again that we are a part of the romance of redemption how the Heavenly bridegroom sought his bride amen how she fell to the Earth how sin came how she got lost from him and he never gave up on her but sent prophets sent Apostles sent holy men all five-fold Ministries to search for her wherever she was and to find her and bring her back onto himself I'm so thankful of God that I heard his word and answered the call amen may God help you to hear his word humble yourself answer the call and let the Holy Spirit speak to your soul to recognize the true from the false amen hallelujah yes sir we thank God that we serve a God who didn't just stay in the heavens but what condescension bringing us Redemption that in dead of night not one Faith Hope inside God gracious tender he laid aside his splendor stupid to win and save my soul let's sing it together oh how I love him how I adore him my breath my sunshine my all and all listen the great creator became my savior and all God's fullness well it in him down from his glory condescending condescending to us coming down from Genesis to Revelation coming down in the form of Melchizedek which was God making himself manifest not yet flesh but in a tiophonic state amen coming down appearing and manifesting true and in the prophets and then finally the fullness of his manifest manifestation in Jesus Christ amen and then he turns around and tells us that you see the Father the great eternal spirit is in me amen he is in me Hallelujah and the Dare will come just as how I and him we are the same person because it's just him and me it's him I am the Flesh on the outside the father manifesting himself through his son one day I'll be in you and you and me and I'll be doing the same thing making my myself manifest to the entire world hallelujah praise God so true this Lord's Supper we are coming into an invisible Union with our Lord Jesus Christ through this memorial service that we are having here today we are entering in to all what I describe as true communion of saints because as you know you don't have to be a saint to be dead I mean you don't have to be dead to be a saint because Paul wrote his letters to whom to the Saints and Ephesus to the Saints in Philippi to the Saints and wherever there were living people born again by the grace of God they were God's saints that were changed by his presence and his power and so they were so where we are here together because communion is people communing talking fellowshipping eating together and spirit with spirit will meet and there is a Confluence of thinking thoughts and ideas and the presence of almighty God just comes and and melts the whole things together making us one in him praise God so we are entering in and that's what we are in right now actually into a real communion of saints hallelujah praise God and when I say that not only you Saints who are here presence present but a communion which embodies all the Believers who have gone before us all those around the world that are having the same Lord's Supper maybe at this time or sometime during the day as we know the world's uh longitudes and latitudes causes that to happen that there may be night here and there somewhere else but we are sharing in that Union by this Supernatural and beautiful time we spend together by the grace of God hallelujah thanks be to God we also are uniting ourselves with the Believers that are to come they're not here yet but we are putting ourselves in that position by seeing the word in the same way that every True Believer will see the word we'll see Jesus Christ will acknowledge Jesus Christ will move and accept him as Lord not only a savior but as their Lord amen he saved your soul but have you surrendered for him to be your lord does he have preeminence within your life or are you just rejoicing in the fact I'm saved I'm saved I'm saved but you allow him in the living room where you allow your visitors but you won't allow him in the kitchen in the bedroom you want to allow him in all the private parts of your home but what I'm saying is we must be open to the grace of God and let the Lord Jesus Come into our lives every part of our Lives not a part of our thoughts our actions activities should be hidden from him because he's not going to tell somebody else he just go talk to him quietly believe you me you'll be surprised at what our God can do blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so let's join with the sense who have gone the Saints who are here and the Saints who are to come and say father make us one just like you are one in Jesus amen and Jesus himself said in that day you shall know that I'm in the Father the father and me and I in you praise God what day is that this day you will know thank God and for those of us who know confidently and by the spiritual recognition what God has done amen then we can say it's beautiful and wonderful this is a beautiful moment this is a wonderful time when we come and sit like this in the presence of the Living God other people may look on it as oh they just come to church but we just don't come to church to meet each other only we come to meet with an unseen being we come to meet with the person of Jesus Christ and wherever he is that is where we want to be because we are his children and not only that we love to be around our father we love to be in that influence of the Holy Spirit or the Living God that who saturates our soul amen praise God what a wonderful moment when he reunites himself with the bride of Jesus Christ when him and his bride can sit there talk and commune and communicate as a husband what with his wife talking back and forth and and uh relishing and enjoying each other's presence isn't that wonderful enjoying that wonderful presence after all people I said well they said you know uh I said look I've had one girlfriend all my life he said who is that I said well my wife she's always been my girlfriend until this hour she's still my girlfriend praise God Amen and sometimes I try to treat her that when she thinks it's a little much now come on so I just gotta watch that praise God but the fact is that is the case amen praise God and the Lord Jesus Christ has only one bride only one bride and she is universal amen and she doesn't belong to this church and that church over there in the other church over there and the others no she is everywhere but the main thing is she must know who her husband is that he is not an institution he's not a person he's not a office of a bishopric or a this or a pastor or a superintendent those are wonderful offices but the person whom we are here to love and serve with all our heart is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah God bless his his heart God bless him wherever he is he gave himself for us he died for us thank God Hallelujah oh praise God Amen who walked upon galilee's Shores and performed miracles no say his name don't be scared to say his name it was Jesus amen yes sir who cast out the devils and healed the sick or was it Mary see who was the one that was persecuted crucified dead and buried what's his name who was the one that rose again from the grave was it Mary or was it Jesus and who you're going to serve Mary or Jesus you see what I'm saying let us serve him with all our hearts with all our minds and put our faith in him for he is the one that died for our sins rose again for our justification coming again in a Rapture to take us away from here amen what a beautiful moment now last December um God blessed me I believe several times I've been into Israel but uh there we went to the Garden tomb of Joseph of aramathia and while we were there some of this congregation was there with me uh also while we were there praise God and we found friends that uh it was a wonderful time to have a communion service because everything was there before you the garden was there you know the garden was there the empty tomb was there with the stone rolled back from it was there and uh they have a little facilities uh that are there where one can go and have a simple communion service just to commemorate what happened up there on golgotha's Hill oh praise God so we had a very short communion service there uh with uh brother George Smith and there my friends the simple observance as we will have today with uh just a little piece of bread and some wine that we had in a small Olive cup do you have that cup here brother let me let me show them it that we I brought that cook back with me just a little cup in which they placed the wine and we just began to sing and praise God as we sang and praise God a very simple uh sacred and memorable moment settled down upon us as taken out of the of the same brother and just let me have it thank you very much this is the cup praise the Lord and I thank the Lord Jesus we had the Lord's Supper it's the olive wood made out of olive wood from there in Israel what a sacred time what a memorable times we had moments together with the prayer in the presence of the Living God it was beautiful beautiful to me and uh I tell you but it's not the place really that made it uh beautiful to me not where all of this was happening that made it really uh beautiful to me but regardless of what Satan has done through the years Through the Ages on the Church of the Living a living God since the Lord Jesus instituted this observance in remembrance he said do this in remembrance of me this is not a request this is a sacred mandate from the presence of almighty God that we are to do this in remembrance of him and since that time Satan has not been able to stop it he's not been able to stop people from having the Lord's Supper he has not been able to obstruct people from participating in this great wonderful institution amen because friends the Lord's Supper has continued to be practiced and to take place in every Church age since the time of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and it's also took place on the different circumstances we are here today we left our homes we drove them cars we came here and now we sit we are here in the word of God it was never like that all the time now when we say we're Christian it brings a certain amount of pride to some people that I am a Christian uh like that but if you understand the word Christian those cross-backed ones uh you know thinking of Jesus carrying the cross and uh when you were called a Christian they were Christians were on The Wanted list of the synagogues the rabbis the Pharisees the Sadducees the epicureans the stoics and the various groups that were there at that time they were on the lookout for them because they were following this man who claims to be the Messiah fire and there in Rome I went into the catacombs they had told as the scripture itself says in Hebrews 11. they they had to hide in dance their hidden caves they hid in all broken homes they're worshiped on the trees they did not have beautiful uh Cathedrals churches uh lovely buildings uh and stuff of that nature some of them worshiped in the woods wherever they could find it but no matter the persecution no matter their debts in the Roman Coliseum no matter what happened the devil could not stamp out this institution and we are here as a testimony of the grace of almighty God that he received us with open arms and Grant to us that he died for our sins oh praise God forevermore amen yes sir and it has been going on Amen amongst various peoples there's not a race on Earth you can put claim Jesus died for us he didn't die for you he didn't die for this person die die for the other person because they're Chinese they're black they're white they're Japanese they're whatever God doesn't care about that amen amen his blood was shed For All Mankind amen and we are thankful to God we are one in that by the grace of God hallelujah amen we are the sons and daughters of God Amen and I'm glad for the skin that he put me in I don't know about you but I give him praise and honor and Glory he knows his reason and his purpose of why he did that amen and from the time Jesus instituted this it has been in practice until this time for the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against the Church of the Living God he's not being able to stop him it's still going on and he'll still go on after we are gone from here he'll still be going on Amen yes sir there is much Beauty in thinking of how Jesus suffered and died for our sins amen and there is still power and Beauty in our testimony when we overcome Satan and we tell him what he's done for us and overcome him by the word of God and by the blood of Jesus Christ amen our testimony and the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God now be no communion is at the heart of what it means to be a True Believer if you're a True Believer you will want to take the Lord's Supper and there is no reason for any of us not to take the Lord's Supper because the Bible says even if you think you sin let a man or woman a person examine themselves do an accounting in your own life you're comfortable for yourself nobody else is accountable for you in other words I can't stand here and say oh you are saved and you are I can't do that I don't know who God knows that so we can't point fingers at anybody we that's why Paul said make your calling and your election sure make sure that that your salvation amen is what God wants it to be amen praise the name of the Lord so in the heart of every believer we have this confidence and faith in God of what it means to us amen praise God and in the life of this church as in any church it is a beautiful and sacred moment that we all should partake of and partake in because we can confess our faults amen we can cleanse ourselves from sin and we can let God have his way within our hearts and life so there's no excuse not to partake in of the Lord's Supper that he has given to us amen I don't know but it's hard to find a more powerful sacred moment than having a real lord supper and the memories thoughts that goes with it when I begin to think that on a hill far away there stood an Old Rugged Cross when I begin to think that there is still Power in the Blood when I begin to think on these things and what he has done for me I give him praise listen since I was a child I know the grace of God I stood on the corner of a street corner there was a turn standing there as on an Easter day like it might be today but as small as a man as I am now just imagine when I was 10 years old and I'm carrying a big kite and the wind just comes and blows the kite and I'm holding on to it for dear life you're not thinking that it's better to lose the kite and keep your life you you want to save your kite Soul Wind Blows the kite and when it blows the kite all of a sudden it blew me over and I was already on an incline and there right there was a moving car I'm seeing that in the instant oh my um while that was going on and I'm falling I felt a gust of wind go like that and I'm back on my feet holding the kite and I wondered what was that oh you can't just get back when you're already falling like that what was that another time this was another Easter I uh some relatives of mine had a great a big mechanic shop not mechanic machine shop where they were turning parts and stuff like that and uh my kite and the tail went around one of the power wires that went to serve service their shop send the current you can guess that was a high powered line but little boys you know you just climb up on the roof where they can't see you when you're doing it and get up there and you know place my hand to pull that line of the tail of the kite off in the moment I put my hand like that my and right then I felt another arm take my hand off I'm still what is that hey man well now I know but what was that but that's what I'm telling you when you look back on your own life some of you sitting there should have been already dead but you're here by the grace of God so many things could have happened but God brought us through what was he doing he was protecting his own because he knows his children there are billions of people in this world but he chose us out like one in a million and brought us to himself that we might know him not only as the written word but to know him in the power of his resurrection amen you've seen the Lord when he is alive and walking like that but have you seen him since he's risen only a few were allowed to see him since he has risen done to experience his presence within their hearts and lives amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah yes sir oh my friends the Lord shared with us the Lord's supper and you know when he did it he did it exactly at the Passover time it was a time of Passover as it is right now we say Passover for the Jews we say Easter for the Christians and and then I think it's Ramadan or something like that for the for the Muslims like that when he did it he did it right at the Passover time you see he was letting them know that he is now bringing fulfillment and that all the types all the Shadows all the substitutes that were there substitute the Lambs the Bullocks the goats the pigeons the dogs that were being sacrificed were all symbols and types that were pointing to the day when the true lamb not the symbol you see there's a difference between the shadow on the wall and the hand that's caught making the shadow now the real thing has arrived and the real thing you know ought to put away your substitute put away your your lambs and stuff of that nature because here comes the true lamb Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world not the sins of just the individual but the sins of the entire world is taken away by the true lamb of the Living God and brings us into the reality of the Fulfillment of what is the Jewish Passover of course that has been practiced and observed by the Jewish people uh down through hundreds and hundreds of years they have been keeping the Passover because the Passover was to let them remember that they were brought out of slavery they were brought out from Egypt with the gods Mighty hand of True Blood and power with pills of fire and a pillar of smoke bringing them out by his mighty hand and so God wanted them to relive that and to remember that Jesus is using the same thing and saying just like that remember me till I come again yes sir I go to Calvary die as the genuine Lamb of God Amen but don't you forget remember what happened here remember what I did for you the blood of lambs could not take away the sins of the worshipers at that time for as the Bible says they have to go back every year to Jerusalem to go and confess and be washed in the cleansing oh praise God but once you come to this blood of Jesus Christ this faith of Jesus Christ once washed you are washed forever you are washed for all time you are Washed by the grace of God Amen praise this wonderful name amen hallelujah amen yes sir I tell you it's wonderful to know this Hallelujah and so God always said I am the Lord who brought you out of Egypt amen always reminding them I am the one who brought you out of slavery out of bondage would be the word you will read in the Bible I brought you out of bondage and I now brought you into freedom and liberty I'm the one who brought you out yes sir praise God hallelujah so Jesus was telling them I am the one who brings you out into not from natural slavery but spiritual slavery I brought you out from all the things that you were wrapped up in praise God brought you into safety and reality and a recognition of who you really are amen hallelujah now we know the Passover and look at the word Passover he says Moses tell them take the blood painted on the door and when I see the blood I will pass over you everyone else that doesn't have that blood on their door he says I'll let the dead Angel wipe every one of the firstborn of Egypt out amen well now it's not a door like that where you can go paint some blood on it but it's the door of your heart is all right and when I see the blood not somebody else tells you it's there or somebody else tells you you're okay no when God sees the blood amen you know the song praise God I think I'm going to sing again when I see the blood when I see the blood let's sing when I see the blood I will pass pass over you a redeemer died on the cross died for The Sinner paid all his Jews pray call your soul blood of the Lamb and I will pass I will pass over you oh where I when I see the blood [Music] when I see the blood Singapore Hallelujah [Music] amen hallelujah praise God you are saved today because the dead Angel the angel of death spiritual death has passed over you God overlooked you he passed over all your sins and that is why several years ago I preached the message that the Passover and mentioned that not only did God pass over us he expects us to look at others see their mistakes you actually know they're in the wrong and yet you're called upon to pass over give that person a chance as we would say to pull their socks up and go on with the lies don't be too anxious I see this I see that I see you you know you'll see all kinds of things but what reaction does God want you to have God wants you to be christ-like he is seeing all the evil in the world but he's not sent a fire and burned the whole thing out the time will come when that will happen after every person has had their opportunity and didn't take it then he'll be able to say every one of you had an opportunity you never took it and so you literally force me now that I have to do this okay but the point of it is we have got to learn how to overlook one another's faults and failures sometimes it's very aggravating I know you're not going to say Amen you're not going to say it because they identify yourself that maybe something or whatever but the fact is sometimes it's so aggravating you don't know how you can take it you know you got the slap on One Cheek you don't know if you got the the temperance the godliness the broadly kindness to turn the other I don't mean literally you're going to be doing that every time like that but it's mainly telling you learn how and when to overlook the false failures and mistakes of others and don't be very quick to point fingers or As we judge but then he says but if you judge then you know the word of God in you with the grace of God Paul said even if you do he said speak the truth to people but don't speak it with the uh intent to to hurt speak the truth in love speak the truth with the grace of God Amen you want to hear any more of this you know I don't want you to uh you know go off and I'm talking but it's still not mean anything much to you here praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen praise His wonderful name so we find out that only the Lord Jesus Christ could truly pass over us and bring us the way we are and I love the fact and I can testify to it he brought me out of the myri clay and place my feet on a rock to stay amen I give him praise today and I thank him for it but he brought me out to the marriage place amen so we have this command of God that we should keep these this great institution not only uh the Lord's Supper but you know water baptism is also another institution that God has given to us that we should keep right it's actually a command he didn't ask you to do it he's telling you if you're a real believer you ought to do it so praise God if you're not baptized you need to be baptized amen baptized in water in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ hallelujah amen just praise God forevermore now let's begin to prepare hearts for the Lord's Supper and the Bible tells us that when we come to do the Lord's Supper First Corinthians 11 tells us clearly on the night the Lord that was betrayed amen Paul said he spoke reveal himself to me and he said on that night and he repeats to him what he told the disciples in that room in the scripture if you'll put it back up Matthew 26 26-30 amen and as they were eating Jesus Took bread blessed it break it and gave it to the disciples take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it praise the name of the Lord I want for us I would love for us to just bar heads where we are while the

thanks and he broke it and gave it to them saying this is my body given for you do this in remembrance of me praise God let's partake of this little simple piece of bread [Music] he was wounded throughout transgressions of course at the center of this service is the congregation the worshipers partaking of these elements and as we take the bread we remember the body of Jesus Christ that was broken for us don't you do you remember that he was broken for you remember that he was wounded for our transgressions that is Isaiah chapter 53 verse 5 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed did you hear that with his stripes we are healed now if you're sick listen to the scripture again he was wounded for our transgressions our mistakes he was bruised for our iniquities our sins amen the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed if you're sick you're healed I said if you're sick you are healed not because I say so but the Bible says so you are healed in the name of Jesus Christ Satan come out from amongst the people lose them right now wherever they are in the name of Jesus Christ and let them go free and experience the Liberty the healing power and presence of the Living God do you believe it do you believe it say Amen praise be to God hallelujah amen glory to his wonderful name praise God we remember of course his Agony in Gethsemane in prayer we remember all the stripes upon his body as Wilma Cooper the songwriter says while they were walking my Lord up calvary's hill as they walked him up the hill they were whipping him bruising him and the blood flowed freely down from him amen yes sir oh we remember also by taking this bread his crucifixion the sudden of the Hammer as they drove the nails in his hands in his feet and the spear within his side they nailed him to the Cross Hallelujah we remember his death and how he died and on Sunday we will speak about him when he rose again is that right he died for our sins Rose for a justification and he's coming again to take us out of here by his Divine Mercy love and grace amen yes sir we remember all about his betrayal and many times we betray him don't talk about Judas let's look at ourselves things we do little mistakes we make oh we have the opportunity to say Lord forgive me dear Lord forgive wash cleanse every every day or every evening or every night before you lay your head because you don't know if you'll rise again the next day don't take it for granted you want to come and say Lord whatever I might have done or said I might not even be aware of what I've done or said that could be Unworthy of you dear Lord forgive ask his forgiveness and cleansing power within your heart and life amen praise God thank God this reminds us of who Our Savior Jesus Christ is and it reminds us of what he has done for us we were supposed to be imprisoned for our own sins our own crimes we are supposed to be judged for the things we have done but he says no father I'll take their place and he took my place at Calvary that's what it is all about he took my place your place at Calvary you're the one that should be wounded you're the one that should have been whipped you're the one that should have been nailed but he was he was wanted for our transgressions he was bruised [Music] for our iniquity surely he born all our sorrow and by his stripes we are here [Music] for our transgression yes he was he was bruised for our end in liquidy surely [Music] and I tribes we are healed amen and now in the same way after the supper [Music] he took the cup saying this cup is the New Covenant in my blood which is poured out for you now we often sing There Is Power in the Blood far in the blood I want to tell you there is still power in the blood the blood that was shelled on Calvary there is still Power in the Blood thanks be to God would

the word of God that's promised in the Bible amen hallelujah praise God forevermore yes there is certainly is Power in the Blood and there is nothing that the blood cannot cleanse is that right the other uh a day I went downstairs and I want to wash a certain piece of clothing um you know it was white so I wanted to take care and you know place it there for washing and thank God when it went down dirty when it went into the bleach and the detergent it came out as white as snow and even no matter how black our sins no matter what we have committed no matter what we have done for all who had murdered Christians said I am the chief of Sinners but your blood was enough to cleanse me amen hallelujah it doesn't matter who you are the blood of Jesus Christ is enough to cleanse you and

wonderful healing service whether it's been going on all the time and if you were believing God God would have been delivering you all the time and cleansing you however we will have a a closing Prayer of Healing For You by the grace of God do you want that amen we certainly have that here by the grace of God thank you Lord hallelujah amen so let us drink the cup I almost got you believing I forgot I don't want to drink all of it I want you to drink it uh I I think I told the brothers this is just funny a young Minister was telling me that his daddy they had the Lord's supper and they left over a lot of wine in a cup and his daddy decided to drink it and five minutes later he's up on the platform like I am now and suddenly he said you asked me why I'm happy I'll tell you the reason why my sins are gone and of course they had to take him off of there and carrying home because he just drank too much of the communion wine well we don't want to do that here tonight but I don't mind having more of the Holy Spirit upon my heart and life thank God as I close that without him we have no peace without him we have no hope and without him we have no future for there is no future for us as Believers but the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ he is the one that brings us out of everything else and places where we we should be amen thank God and now here we are we are on our way to heaven and we're Shelton victory amen amen I don't know about you but I'm shouting victory my sins are gone so my sins are gone my sins are gone praise the Lord my sins are gone and I thank God that my sins
