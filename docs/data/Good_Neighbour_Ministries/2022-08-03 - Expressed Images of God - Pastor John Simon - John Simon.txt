connecticut they are doing fine by the grace of god and pressing on in his great love thank god for them we appreciate them so much and pray the lord will continue to bless and use them now it's wednesday middle of the week so i'm going to go right to the word and we'll see what god has for us amen genesis 1 11. this scripture means more to me and i i appreciate it very much because it seems to be one that's always led me and guided me and i give god praise honor and glory and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so gracious father we thank you for this written word of the bible preserved and kept through the ages so that never mind every attempt to boil burn destroy it that we might not have a record of it something that we can put in our hearts and in our minds you preserved your word lord all the hammers are all broken and faded away and the anvil of god's word remains the same we thank you for this father and we pray lord that you'll quicken the word to us and make it alive lord and let it live again let the bible live again and oh father we will continue to rejoice in your presence and give you all the praise all the honor and the glory that is due under your marvelous and wonderful name god bless you all please be seated thank god we appreciate every one of you here tonight now i would like i i'm talking on expressed images of god expressed images of god uh and we go back to this wonderful marvelous verse we will touch on that but we know uh brother sister that god is not leaving us in the midst of chaos and in the midst of trial and tribulation that this age has within it we know of course god uses trials tribulation temptations and traps and tests uh uh to refine us right that's the refiners fire that we must pass through from time to time right we'll take the iron or the metal the gold and take it out and leave it let it cool off and then put it back in the fire again and every time it comes out it's of a higher worth and higher refining value and condition and the god does the same thing with us that he can get us to our highest place that we ought to be in him and therefore in every age we find god does that and we know the bible tells us tribulation is coming that tells us plainly the there's an oncoming storm that is about to strike the entire earth but thanks be to god we have god's promise hallelujah praise god we have his promise that we are not going through the tribulation but that we are going to be taken out or away from the tribulation if we're to look at the types in the bible we find that before the rain even fell one drop even fell god had noah and his family in the ark the door was already closed amen oh praise god with luck we see the same thing with lot that uh before uh sodom could be burnt and totally destroyed the angel already had come and said escape hidden quickly amen because i can't destroy this place until you get out of it and praise god god can't display destroy this place until we get out of it and when we get out of it then confusion and chaos you think you're seeing confusion now you think you're seeing chaos now but this is nothing from the time we leave here because we are god he told us we are the salt of the earth and when the salt is taken out and nothing to hinder the devil from his works anymore then he is going to be raging roaring and doing everything that he had in his mind but we will not be here during that time don't take his scarecrows don't you fear nothing the true believer has lost all fear of hell we lost all fear of tribulation because we know we are not going to be in it we are not going to be here at that time because the bride every type every shadow shows she will be out of here look at moses before the dead angel even struck god had spoken to a prophet and warned him to tell the people get in the house paint the blood on the door and stay in the house once you get in and if i see when i see the blood i'll pass i'll pass over you amen and certainly my friends the same thing happens here now that we are not going into any tribulation because remember jesus already took our tribulation on himself he bore all our sins all our trespasses all are mistakes all are wrong he bore them upon himself so he took our tribulation already and that is why the believer is not going into judgment either amen when we hear the word judgment we don't tremble and shake because our judgment is us to our rewards it's towards our blessings our rankings our standing when we get into his divine presence hallelujah but every seed must bring forth after its kind now listen all right every seed must come forth after its kind but god made man in his own image after his kind amen not its kind but after his kind praise god hallelujah now and you see he expressed that image in christ in jesus christ hallelujah now let me pause here a minute a principle was expressed a command was given every seed shall bring forth after its kind and when god speaks the word that word is forever and eternity it goes on it can't stop that law has to go on and on and on because it's the word of god amen and so we see here that the quotation he he was expressed image in jesus christ what was it it was god that was in christ see now there is a man that's after god's kind the man that comes with what god in him the woman that comes with god in her god's children coming with a portion of himself in them and there become the expressed image of god on this earth today hallelujah you may not take much of yourself you may want sometimes to put yourself down but god regardless of how you look how your expression of him looks god purpose and ordained these things so hallelujah we will get and touch upon that just a little bit more that's why we are none of us are like one another we're all expressing him but through the prism of our personalities we express god in all kinds of shining lights of his divine presence uh the thought is now come to me of how brother brahma expressed him as the great diamond and when the diamond scintillates and shines it comes out in all these various colors amen but it's one diamond but many colors are ways of it expressing itself and it's the same way that god is expressing himself and we become express images of god for this hour and for his glory and for his help praise amen now remember how many knows this that he was a man after his kind hallelujah in other words we're talking the stature of a perfect man which is jesus christ amen glory to god now see when the word was in christ a man a human man expressing itself through him that was god that was the word that was in christ expressing himself because god in the beginning made man in his own image hallelujah and that's the kind of man that god has this mind that he wanted to make jesus is a perfect picture and display of god in his express image hallelujah because when god gets in a man then he's the manifest image or the man can manifest the image of god that's in him and that man or woman becomes the express visible image of god here on the earth now that's the kind of of god of man that's the kind of people that god makes today let me repeat that that's the kind of man or woman people that god makes today hallelujah he's talking now about the the new creation the new creation is not a physical creation of of a flesh but it's a new creation hallelujah it's spiritual creation praise god people in other words the new creation is people coming on the earth with the word already built into them the word is a coming as a built-in amen they they come down with that in them praise the lord and to be the expressed images of god hallelujah now see here the seminary what he's saying can't do that because that's uh nothing but an incubator or a actuary see that can only turn up a bunch of hybrids he's talking about people that have part of uh reading the bible and christian acts and christian works and their half bible and half world half bible have flesh they can even have half message and half kernel and carnality carried away with those things but god is looking for a people that would be his express image which is the word that will express the gene the life that's what is in them that he placed there that they will let go enough so that he can express himself his own image through the people now see they do that through them seminaries the schools when god calls a man he is in his own image hallelujah so what is god's image he said that is the word made alive in him or her praise god when the word in you starts coming alive now why i'm so thrilled about this because i understand brother branham said he'll preach the message he's a messenger he came to bring the message after he brings the message people are going to start recognizing is that right then they start hearing and and got a sense that there's something something there that that that is pulling on them but they can't catch it yet then after all he doesn't say it like i'm saying it but i'm expressing it that they can start hearing and on another level or stage of the message maybe years past time past they all of a sudden they're going to recognize they're going to start to recognize now they're going to start recognizing things hallelujah and i thank god i believe that we have an r at that place where we have heard and we are recognized but now what what is it that i'm getting at is now we come to the next stage hearing recognizing and acting on the word but now we understand that acting is not you going out and putting on an act amen but when god is ready for this what we call the quick short work of science wonders miracles it's not going to be you it's going to be him moving through his body it'll be a spontaneous outburst of the power and the presence of almighty god without human effort so that all will know this is not a man this is of the lord this is not the bill this is of the lord this is not the lane this is of the lord this is not of this woman or this boy this is of the lord only god can do these things amen hallelujah and that is what we are in the middle of that right now and we don't know maybe it happens with a few of us one thing here one little thing there but it's going to burst forth amen and when it bursts forth it's every one of us every single one doesn't matter what you do you say oh but i don't want that i don't know if i can handle that let me tell you it's going to happen so simple so humble that you realize the extent to what god using you talk about deborah in the bible you talk about this one in the bible and that one the bible let me tell you the bible is right here people with that same anointing is right here hallelujah amen and the beauty of it is that you may think nothing of yourself which is the way god wants you to just be a humble and relaxed and be in him and just walk hallelujah praise god and not to go there like a pentecostal and say in the name of jesus i cast this devil or i do this or in the name of the lord with authority and come command power and whatnot no the saints of god under this anointing simple and humble go up to a hospital bed of a friend and say oh man i'm sorry this happened to you god bless you everything i'm i'm not giving you a template here because normally that's what you're going to do anyway if the holy spirit is moving on you praise god but then you see you move to the stage where the words you speak their spirit in their life and you just speak and you don't realize that is what he's talking about speaking the word is that getting up there in the name of jesus no it's not it's just walking in him when you walk in him when he's ready he'll express himself hallelujah and you'll be surprised your mans that your own self amen hallelujah before you know it something comes out of your mouth he said think not in that day and in that hour don't even think what you're going to say because the heavenly father will speak through you god will do his works through you amen i'm trying to tell you and i'm telling myself get yourself out of the way amen all the self all the carnality all that get it out of the way so that he can have a vessel to express and manifest himself through praise the name of the lord we're gonna go let's go forward a little bit more praise god now remember god and jesus said that if that man comes in god's image and in his likeness amen he'll do the works that i do praise god see in his image and his lightness in the image of the word and in the likeness or similarity of the works he did when he was here on earth is that right you go certain things going to happen in you through you and around you that will make people to recognize a similarity praise god nothing you're putting on it just happens it's because god is in you working through you for his glory isn't that a beautiful rest that the believers have entered into and those who have not yet entered into can enter into this rest by the holy spirit revealing to you that is not of works but of his will and his plan and his purpose amen praise god now remember he said i repeat his kind his kind what is his kind his kind is the word hallelujah he is the word so then you see if a man claims he claims he is a christian he claims he's of the word then and turns around and denies the word of god then you know that's a hybrid that's a hybrid right there because how can you be the express image of god himself the word and turn around and deny the word you can't do it amen when the word is the express image of himself think of it express image express image of god god bring us here and we become express images of god hallelujah yes he made us in his own image express image praise god while i was reading this you know and then it comes to me like it's just like a photographer right you know brother branham talk about god taking a photograph but just think of a photographer taking pictures and he will take uh pictures of the same object from different angles it's the same object the object can change but he's taking it from different angles so when i express what i see is because i'm expressing it from this angle of what god has shown me and another man another sister another brother oh praise god will express it that way because that's the picture from a different angle one took it on his knees looking up one take it from high up looking down one take it from this angle another take it from that angle another take it from another angle one ticket near one take it from far away but it's the same object and the same picture in the same image but you may think it's different because one take it from far you may think it's different because one ticket from there it's the same image hallelujah on praise god the way we express him within ourselves may be different to him to her to that one to the next one whatever but it's the way god planned purpose and predestinated the entire thing to take place to confuse confuse and overthrow the devil because he doesn't know what's going on it's god in action god expressing themselves making himself known in this hour hallelujah praise god but that uh that photographer doesn't only take it from different angles amen but you got a higher form of photography where some of those guys won't take picture a picture until the light is perfect for what they want the light gonna strike that object from in a certain way before they take that picture so taking the same picture in different lights so everybody is not going to understand everything like this brother or that sister or the other one but each one has something of that image in a different light hallelujah a bright light maybe you've got it with a low light there oh my pray the rest of it you can think on it but the picture is being taken hallelujah the image is there hallelujah maybe a little blurry here maybe a little this there a little but the image is there hallelujah but and god sees the image hallelujah praise god oh blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah and when we know what he's saying here expresses the thought that every gene every child of god comes with the image of god or gene of god in them they come having a certain image of their daddy some little thing about them just like their daddy they can't help it that's just what they are because it's not an act it's it's just what how they are they were born they were made that way praise god and so we find this the same thing with the true believer praise god hallelujah amen so we look at him and express that image is expressed hallelujah and the image goes forth because each one of us may be expressing different parts of his personality you may have more temperance than her he might have more patience than the other brother she might have this and he might have three of those things or four or five or whatever that are predominant they have all but three or four of those things might be predominant until the person is recognized and known that that brother has patience that sister oh that's this kind of temperance and so on so on you understand what the point i'm trying to make here amen praise the lord but everyone has all of it amen but god may choose in this image to emphasize this you may choose in this image to emphasize that what he chooses to do that's up to him but the images of god expressing the word of god has sent down here for his glory and for his honor praise god hallelujah now think of it yes in his own image after his own kind the new of this new creation to be what are they here for to be his expressed image on the earth page 57 spoken word the original seed that's a very very uh to the point quotation of brother branham saying it clear that they were predestinated to be here to be the expressed word of god on the earth now jesus talking about back then was god express word on the earth hallelujah then do you believe that then what are we to be this now and this time hallelujah god's word expressed here on the earth hallelujah sons and daughters of god with the express word caring carrying out what that that is the mystical body of jesus christ amen carrying on the same things he did when he was here on earth and that's the kind of people that are after his kind do you believe it amen now if you want to this is brother branham speaking this is not me saying this now you can you can be after the lutheran kind if you want you can be after the lutheran kind now many of you know how years ago he says no talking to me don't go this route you will come after his kind but if you listen to me and listen to this word you'll come after my kind whose side what image you're gonna choose right but here we find brother sister his brother brandman's saying this here now you can have or come after the lutheran kind now or the method is kind or the baptist kind the catholic kind or the pentecostal kind amen after it's kind of oneness or trinity amen hallelujah but if you are of god's kind that is different amen because you are the express image of the word now on earth making itself manifest hallelujah the word now making itself manifest not the word making itself manifest in jesus back there but the true believer becomes the express image of that word to the world right out here for the glory of god oh praise god forevermore amen let me express something here my friends now some people get upset and angry when you preach and you call out the names of other of denominations it irks them it bothers them but you know let me say something i learned something the devil always gets mad you can say that's the devil or or that's the devil or that's wicked or that's evil but when you name that demon oh my goodness you call that demon by his express name he goes wild doesn't matter where he is he goes wild oh my it's the same thing and i see that happening even with uh preaching not that you go purposely to do that but it's there and you've got to say it and when you say it it it brings up all the spirits that are hidden up in people and hidden up around them it just works everything up like that but that's what the word of god says here amen yes sir so you then he said do you see it after god's kind then you are the express image of the word now making itself manifest the word making itself manifest oh my if the water falls on that is on it it's got to do it hallelujah you got a gene in there and the water falls on that it's got to express it's got to do that hallelujah amen now just to bring your attention just a note i had here how that the seven church ages also expressed the image of god but it did it through seven ages coming down coming down coming down and we are now in the last sure this last church age uh i'm talking about coming down through the ages through the the image of a man expressed in the image of the ox expressed in the image of the eagle and we know he's going to express an image of the lion hallelujah and express in the image of what a dead stump and then expressed in the image of a sprout and now in the last age expressed in the image of a bright tree that is blooming by rivers of living waters that is the image that we are moving and operating under here by the holy spirit amen praise the name of the lord how wonderful to know that uh we are god's word expressed and being made manifest in this hour blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah now remember god made man after his own image do you get this a man after his own kind do you understand what what kind of a man then was he if you look back you'll see that when he was made flesh and expressed himself that's the kind of man that's the kind of image amen that god wanted it to be hallelujah so then at another time he looked at david and said you're a man after my own heart what david with all kind of thoughts all kinds of mistakes all kinds of blood on his hands and yet god said you're a man after my own heart and uh put it all in my own words here praise god you see david even in all the stuff that he was doing that was ungodly wasn't right sinful and so on god could see in him he was expressing as the great potter was forming this image he was already expressing a portion of that image was already manifesting in him in other words he had the spirit of christ manifesting in him because here brother branham goes on said you see he already had a little portion yeah that spirit of christ in him and 800 years later what happened now the whole word comes on the scene all he had was a little portion of the word in him amen and it made him do what he did but here comes the whole world and it went on top of the hill and stood and jesus wept up there on the hill oh jerusalem oh they're using them as a rejected king rejected king there rejected king here again it's the same spirit so what he is really saying of david is that the image that god had in his mind though it was not perfect in expressing itself true david at the time back then but as it come up through the edges is finding men women that were placed there and he can continue to work on his pottery if we want to put it that way and bring it up until he has the perfect one to express himself through whom we know is jesus christ hallelujah amen yes sir praise god amen so brother sister you understand what i'm saying that even though you maybe you say oh i i did this or i made that mistake you just asked god to forgive you ask god to cleanse you from that because god is not looking at that amen what god is looking at is the image of god and the gene that's in you how that every day is being allowed to express itself because it can't express anything else but him because it's a part of him amen is a part of him and wants to express itself praise the name of the lord hallelujah praise god david you're a man after my own heart i'm gonna wrap this up now amen you see when god creates a man hallelujah he is after his kind like david thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against you oh my think of it thy word have i old testament of i hid in my heart that i might not sin against you hallelujah new testament you come with the word already hid in your heart praise the lord that you might not sin against him praise the lord and the prophet says claim it's not you you didn't sin you didn't commit no sin the seed of god does not commit sin amen but the devil using what he made what not what he made he can't create but what he designed to be this way amen using and manipulating that to do all them works of the flesh amen but the man inside stands firm with the word of god immovable unshakable can't because that's the seed of god the gene of god and it cannot commit sin but you see one thing david he needed was the raid hallelujah ray he had the seed but he didn't have the rain uh oh my david would have been all right if he would have just had the rain he repeats that's repeat again but you see the holy ghost was not yet given amen so it was the seed was there and god could see that but the holy ghost was not yet given because jesus had not yet been crucified so that he could give up the ghost and the rain could come back to quicken that seed at that particular time oh my woe think of it now thy word the word was in him oh hallelujah and he could know it because he said i've hid it in my heart lord but it won't bloom it it's not acting like it should but but the word is in my heart can all of us sometime in some part of our life say the same thing you see the word you know what you know the word you know what you're supposed to do and how you're supposed to act and you hide the word within your heart but it's not glooming like it should it's not manifesting like it should hallelujah i hid it in my heart lord but it won't bloom and act like it should but lord i've hid it i have hid it amen but you see when jesus came which was the word whole word made manifest took the germ of life out of it and brings it back to the word and if david said his cup run it over amen what he's saying is david's cop run it over with the gene in him but without the spirit to water it he says here what should ours do amen david's cup run it over what should ours do i want to tell you tonight as i conclude this that god wants every one of us to be conformed to the image of jesus christ as paul has said in the epistles that we would look at him and confirm to that image don't be conformed to the world but be confirmed to his image be an express image of the living god expressing himself through the word in us here upon the earth amen god bless you for this for taking the time to receive this thought here tonight out of the word of god may god richly bless you while the musicians come hallelujah we're just going to sing one little chorus and the brother dave can take it from there if he feels led if not uh closing prayer and we can be on our way praise the name to be like jesus i know we sang it we'll sing it again and praise god because that's what we want to be [Music] to right like jesus on earth i lost on earth [Applause] [Music] like him [Music] all through my journey from earth to glory i only asked to be like god bless you be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i love to be like all through life's journey from earth to glory i only [Music] [Music] i've been born again to win i thank god he justified me of this fullness we have all received [Music] more than a conqueror that's what i am i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man i'm a new creation i'm [Music] [Applause] that's what i am a new creation i'm a brand new man man you're dismissed tonight [Music]
