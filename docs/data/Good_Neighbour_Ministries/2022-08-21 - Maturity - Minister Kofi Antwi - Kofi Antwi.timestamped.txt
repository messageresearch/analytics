[37:38] i didn't know you were preaching this
[37:40] morning
[37:42] i have no idea said in the trustee
[37:44] office
[37:45] you're just fellowship
[37:47] anyway
[37:48] so my apologies i didn't know you're
[37:49] preaching no
[37:52] i was expecting god to speak so i'm
[37:54] looking around anyway
[37:57] and god spoke through you the lord was
[37:59] blessing us this morning because
[38:01] uh we were just
[38:03] the thought that we were thinking on
[38:05] this morning was
[38:06] maturity a mature bride
[38:08] and uh
[38:10] and i told brother coffee i said brother
[38:12] you know you could
[38:14] you could see a
[38:16] young lady and this has nothing to do
[38:18] with how old you are by the way but
[38:20] generally speaking how will you see a
[38:22] young lady she could be fully formed
[38:26] and uh and everything but here you are
[38:28] as a
[38:30] uh
[38:31] what are you 40 years old 30 35
[38:34] 60
[38:37] here you are as a a mature man
[38:40] but you can't have fellowship
[38:42] you got to have fellowship
[38:44] with somebody who's mature and i just
[38:47] we're just talking about that and how he
[38:49] is mature
[38:51] and he can only have fellowship with a
[38:52] mature bride
[38:54] and that's what he's after he's a mature
[38:56] bride
[38:57] and uh
[38:58] i trust that uh no matter where you are
[39:01] we're just all growing by god's grace
[39:03] but we're growing in maturity and we
[39:06] have to come to that place
[39:08] and uh let's have fellowship with him
[39:11] but i honestly i didn't know you were
[39:12] preaching so i didn't know i was i was
[39:14] disturbing you
[39:16] i was blessed
[39:18] because i was expecting god to give me
[39:21] the title
[39:23] of my message
[39:25] and here he came
[39:29] and he spoke about maturity
[39:32] right
[39:33] and in my heart i was thinking
[39:36] i was gonna give a title like god
[39:40] wife
[39:43] no matter what the devil does
[39:45] will come up victory
[39:50] so when he came and he was speaking in
[39:52] that line i caught
[39:54] him and secondly
[39:58] in my heart this morning
[40:02] the thought was saying brother
[40:04] timber before even i
[40:07] i read my scripture finish you have to
[40:09] pray
[40:11] before i perceive the word of god
[40:14] and i'm thinking about god that lord is
[40:17] it my mind or god is doing something
[40:22] and here the brother called him to pray
[40:25] the words that i was thinking in my
[40:28] heart
[40:29] even was coming from his lips
[40:32] i was on the back there crying because i
[40:35] know that vindicate to me
[40:38] that god
[40:41] is
[40:42] moving
[40:44] so

[44:16] okay the scripture read first john
[44:18] chapter 3 verse
[44:20] 3.
[44:22] and every man that he
[44:25] and every man that had this hope in him
[44:29] perfect himself
[44:31] even as he is pure
[44:33] whosoever commits sin
[44:36] transgreate also the law
[44:39] for sin
[44:41] is the transgression of the law
[44:45] and you know that he
[44:49] is
[44:52] manifested to take away our sins
[44:56] and in him is no sin
[45:00] whosoever
[45:02] uh
[45:03] whosoever
[45:07] abided in him
[45:09] saying it not
[45:10] whosoever seen it had not seen him
[45:14] neither know him
[45:16] little children let no man deceive you
[45:20] he that
[45:22] he that
[45:23] does
[45:24] righteousness is righteous even as he is
[45:28] righteous
[45:30] he that commits sin is of
[45:33] the devil
[45:35] for the devil sin from the beginning
[45:38] for this purpose
[45:41] the son of god was manifested
[45:44] that he might destroy
[45:46] the works of the devil
[45:49] okay so
[45:51] whosoever is born of god
[45:54] does not commit sin
[45:57] for
[45:58] his seed remained in him
[46:02] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[46:06] god
[46:08] in this the children of god
[46:12] are manifested and the children of the
[46:16] devil whosoever does not
[46:20] righteousness
[46:21] is not of god
[46:24] neither he that love it not his brother
[46:29] for this is the message that he heard
[46:33] from the beginning
[46:35] that
[46:36] we should love one another
[46:40] not
[46:41] as cain
[46:42] who was
[46:44] of the of that wicked one and slew his
[46:49] brother
[46:51] and
[46:52] therefore slow he him because his own
[46:57] words were evil
[46:59] and
[47:00] his brother's righteous
[47:03] marvel north my brethren
[47:05] if
[47:06] the world hates you
[47:09] we know
[47:10] that we have
[47:13] past
[47:14] past from death unto life
[47:17] because we love the brethren
[47:21] he
[47:22] that loveth not his brother abide in
[47:26] dead
[47:27] okay that's
[47:29] verse 5
[47:31] chapter 5 verse 3
[47:33] for this is the love of god
[47:37] that we keep his commandments
[47:41] and his commandments
[47:43] are not grieved
[47:46] for
[47:47] whatsoever is born of god overcome the
[47:52] world
[47:52] and
[47:54] this is the victory that overcome the
[47:58] world
[47:58] even our faith
[48:01] may the lord have this blessing
[48:04] praise the lord
[48:08] god is good
[48:10] please be seated
[48:15] you know
[48:20] when we were born we were born with the
[48:22] seed of god
[48:25] and
[48:27] the devil taught
[48:30] because
[48:32] what our mother eve did
[48:36] sometimes and many other times
[48:39] he put
[48:42] so many dust
[48:45] garbages on our flesh
[48:50] and he accuses
[48:54] even when we come to church
[48:57] what he does is
[48:59] he will continue accusing us
[49:03] and because we're born into a cultural
[49:07] family
[49:09] we have taken the world
[49:12] wisdom so much and we didn't know who we
[49:15] are
[49:16] but
[49:17] god by his grace know who we are
[49:22] because the pharisees
[49:25] when mary magdalene
[49:27] committed adultery which it was not her
[49:31] it was the devil
[49:33] packing some garbage on her flesh
[49:37] and that devil was accusing mary
[49:39] magdarin and saying
[49:42] i caught you on the very act
[49:45] right
[49:47] it was the devil accusing mary magdalene
[49:50] and may why
[49:52] because of what our mother eve did
[49:56] so the seed was buried in mary murdering
[49:59] but jesus knew
[50:02] god knows our hearts
[50:05] he knows each and every one heart
[50:09] what kind of seed is hidden there
[50:13] and no matter what that seed
[50:17] if it is of god
[50:19] no matter how much dust the devil has
[50:22] put on it
[50:24] that seed
[50:26] it will grow
[50:28] and come maturity
[50:31] and it will grow
[50:32] and fulfill what god has accomplished
[50:35] that seed to accomplish
[50:38] jesus said my seed will
[50:41] my word will never return unto me void
[50:44] it means it is his seed
[50:47] the true seed word of god in you
[50:51] it will never return why no matter what
[50:54] you do
[50:55] that seed is going to come forth
[50:59] so when mary murray
[51:02] the devil was accusing her i caught her
[51:04] on the very act
[51:06] and it's true she caught her that is the
[51:08] flesh
[51:10] but jesus looked
[51:12] beyond the flesh of mary madarin and he
[51:15] was seeing his seed
[51:18] and he said
[51:19] jesus said
[51:21] turn to the devils
[51:23] i call them devils there were
[51:26] you and i naturally speaking they were
[51:28] standing there as human beings
[51:31] but they were devils
[51:34] right
[51:35] they were devils
[51:37] accusing the seed of god
[51:40] that that is not of god
[51:42] but jesus was looking beyond
[51:47] and saying
[51:48] amongst you who have never committed sin
[51:52] let him cast the first stone
[51:54] they were supposed
[51:56] because they cannot
[51:58] cast the stone because they themselves
[52:02] they don't have the seed word of god
[52:05] because the seed of god does not sin
[52:09] that seed
[52:11] once you are born into this world the
[52:14] seed in you
[52:16] god sent it here to come to make
[52:19] manifest because you your seed is the
[52:22] word
[52:24] for the hour
[52:26] that's why the devil tried to accuse you
[52:29] some of us the devil has been accusing
[52:32] us for too long
[52:34] even when we come to church he's he'll
[52:37] continue bombarding some of us
[52:40] but let me tell you
[52:42] this is the hour
[52:44] if the seed of god dwells in your soul
[52:47] you have to know who you are
[52:50] that in you there is no sin
[52:54] in you is christ the lord
[52:57] a new is maturity of the lord
[53:00] he knew his profession of the lord
[53:03] in you is the glory of the lord
[53:06] in you everything jesus said
[53:09] he was talking about you
[53:12] and you are here
[53:15] the devil can do you nothing
[53:19] don't be afraid that's why brother
[53:21] abraham
[53:22] when i think it was a cow or something
[53:25] he saw somebody tall
[53:27] in his uh vision or something he says
[53:29] boo
[53:30] that was that
[53:32] was the devil trying to pull him down
[53:36] but when he said boo the team begin to
[53:38] get smaller and smaller and smaller and
[53:40] smaller and smaller there is a bullet
[53:43] anything going away
[53:44] that is same time
[53:47] satan is a bluff
[53:49] it is a blood to you
[53:52] god has used pastor simon
[53:55] with the fight for ministry i'm looking
[53:57] at the corners
[53:59] sitting here
[54:00] building you
[54:02] taking all the dust that covering you
[54:06] taking every
[54:08] tradition every culture
[54:12] every sin
[54:13] that the devil has buried you
[54:16] but god doesn't see you as a sinner
[54:20] he sees you as a pure heart
[54:23] and the bible says blessed are the pure
[54:27] in heart for they shall see god
[54:31] so you will see god
[54:33] if you are true pure seed word of god
[54:37] you will see god
[54:39] nothing can change you
[54:41] nothing will be hindering you
[54:43] not to see christ
[54:45] because let me tell you in him is
[54:49] perfection
[54:50] in him the world that things the world
[54:54] having seen in him dwell the fullness of
[54:57] godhead bodily
[54:59] so you are in him
[55:02] you are perfect
[55:04] i said you are perfect
[55:07] i don't see you as a sinner i don't see
[55:11] listen i'm not here in interested of
[55:14] nobody mistake
[55:16] that is the devil that put into my
[55:19] brother the devil that put that mistake
[55:21] into my sister i don't care about that
[55:25] all i care is the seed of god laying
[55:28] down there
[55:29] that's what i'm interested
[55:32] that's what the quality is that's what
[55:34] the profession is that's where
[55:37] we came here to fulfill the word of god
[55:42] this is the hour
[55:43] this is the time
[55:45] this is the hour the blind the wife of
[55:49] christ won't be deceived
[55:51] because no matter what he do
[55:54] god has let us know who we are that's
[55:57] why jesus when he told mary magdalene
[56:01] go home
[56:03] and see no more what is sin unbelief of
[56:06] god where
[56:08] sin is not drinking committing adultery
[56:11] the prophet has told us already brother
[56:14] abraham has as god in him
[56:18] has let him expose
[56:21] the word of god to us playing before our
[56:24] eyes and we know
[56:27] that listen even when he preached
[56:30] the same devil has come in the message
[56:33] using the course
[56:35] thinking he can deceive the elect
[56:38] with your big cause
[56:39] but brothers and sisters let me tell you
[56:42] this is not about a man
[56:45] this is not about some great man would
[56:49] get caught because he can quote the
[56:51] bible can read the bible the prophet
[56:54] couldn't read bearer
[56:56] and when he told even the preachers they
[57:00] told him
[57:01] you cannot read better you gonna go
[57:05] around the world with no education to
[57:07] preach to
[57:09] things and this and that the prophet
[57:11] says i'm not lis i'm not leaning to my
[57:15] own
[57:17] knowledge i'm not learning to whether i
[57:19] can read or i can't read all that
[57:22] matters is god in my soul
[57:25] he told me
[57:27] what i will do
[57:29] and if god has told you
[57:32] god has called you
[57:35] he told you before the foundations of
[57:37] this world and call you out
[57:41] you have to know who you are
[57:44] you have to stand up
[57:46] and push the devil away
[57:48] because
[57:49] you are a child of god
[57:52] one revelation will crush the devil
[57:55] ahead
[57:56] because you were in christ
[58:00] because the bible says
[58:03] go read genesis 3
[58:05] the seed of the woman will bruise the
[58:08] serpent head and he will bruise his heel
[58:11] who was that christ and where were you
[58:14] you were in christ
[58:16] so when he broke the serpent head
[58:20] don't you know you are part of that
[58:21] bruising the second head
[58:23] and if you are here in flesh you're
[58:26] gonna do the same thing
[58:29] because it is jesus
[58:32] i said it is jesus
[58:34] here is jesus
[58:36] pull the gift
[58:38] i said pour the gifts you will pray the
[58:41] gift as i'm standing here let me tell
[58:44] you it's like a sea
[58:46] i see
[58:47] the water is in inside so much but if
[58:50] you don't pull the gift the the water
[58:53] won't rival
[58:55] the word won't come out it will get
[58:57] stuck
[58:58] but you will pray the gift
[59:01] don't look at me that oh brother coffee
[59:03] is oh nothing we never see him stand
[59:06] here it doesn't mean nothing to god
[59:09] glory to god
[59:11] glory to jesus
[59:13] let jesus have his way this morning
[59:16] i tell you the truth
[59:18] i have been in a place
[59:21] where i'm speaking the power of god
[59:24] will fall
[59:26] people dropping down
[59:28] crying devils coming out healing i've
[59:31] seen all that
[59:33] i know what god can do
[59:36] i know i can do it let me tell you as i
[59:39] stand here god knows my heart i cannot
[59:42] do it
[59:43] but he can
[59:45] i'm trusting him
[59:47] once he
[59:49] is in my soul
[59:51] that's all matter i move myself out of
[59:55] the way i'm not a proper preacher with
[59:58] dignitaries and
[1:00:00] proper way talking yes sir
[1:00:03] god there with me on the street

[1:00:39] gonna bring the word
[1:00:41] whether you like it or not

[1:00:47] because
[1:00:48] i even told him i have fought with him
[1:00:51] i have fought with god i remember one
[1:00:54] time when i came to the message i was
[1:00:57] telling blood that's more and brother
[1:00:59] philip
[1:01:00] a brother used to tell me oh
[1:01:02] brother i wish they have to put you on
[1:01:05] the pulpit to preach
[1:01:07] and i got to pass a simon knowing
[1:01:10] nothing brother i have no knowledge
[1:01:12] nothing i said brother i believe god
[1:01:15] called me to preach that time when we
[1:01:17] went early stage he rebuked me but you
[1:01:20] know what
[1:01:21] that time god has revealed him to me
[1:01:24] that is my pastor so as soon as he said
[1:01:27] that i said brother you are right
[1:01:31] you are right and that put me off i know

[1:03:31] in his mind
[1:03:34] what is this brother doing what are you
[1:03:36] going to preach tonight
[1:03:39] all of a sudden there was a letter in
[1:03:41] his
[1:03:43] pocket
[1:03:45] but someone has visited him
[1:03:48] and told him
[1:03:50] when he comes to the prayer night she'll
[1:03:52] tell the church to pray for brother
[1:03:54] frank that time brother frank was there
[1:03:58] i look at brother gabriel i said brother
[1:04:00] gabra pray for brother frank
[1:04:02] is her go boom
[1:04:07] he confessed say brother
[1:04:10] i know
[1:04:12] that
[1:04:14] how this is what i was thinking when you
[1:04:16] were standing there
[1:04:17] i said brother let me tell you
[1:04:20] if you really know who
[1:04:22] is standing there
[1:04:24] i'm struggling even i don't want it i'm
[1:04:27] i'm crying for the deacon to be there
[1:04:30] [Applause]
[1:04:32] but i'm telling the truth as it is
[1:04:36] i'm crying for the deacons to be there i
[1:04:38] don't want to be there
[1:04:40] but
[1:04:41] i says nobody's there i see trey of us
[1:04:44] coming along we have to at least
[1:04:46] somebody have to stand and it fall on me
[1:04:50] so i have to just do literally
[1:04:53] brother gabriel recognized
[1:04:55] that this brother
[1:04:57] no god
[1:04:59] is doing something
[1:05:01] that time i try to run run run run run
[1:05:04] but the moment i run i
[1:05:06] can't i can't
[1:05:09] it's listen
[1:05:10] preaching is not by education
[1:05:15] it's not by how a man will choose you
[1:05:18] and put you in the pulpit bank
[1:05:21] no
[1:05:22] denomination does that mean
[1:05:26] right denominations does that and even
[1:05:30] in this message so many preachers have
[1:05:33] done that
[1:05:35] but that is not the way of god
[1:05:38] amen i am not saying god can
[1:05:41] like god's servant pastor simon
[1:05:44] god can reveal to him
[1:05:46] i'm using him as an example
[1:05:48] to point
[1:05:50] a brother
[1:05:52] to choose a brother to lead
[1:05:55] you understand god use
[1:05:58] people like that
[1:06:00] but it has gone so bad
[1:06:04] in the message
[1:06:05] this is what they are doing
[1:06:08] and it's thinking god knows
[1:06:13] okay
[1:06:14] those things stink in god knows because
[1:06:18] god
[1:06:20] set in the church
[1:06:22] the fight for ministry
[1:06:25] god chose them
[1:06:27] god will vindicate them
[1:06:29] he'll vindicate them by his way he will
[1:06:32] identify them
[1:06:34] whether they are i always say whether
[1:06:36] they are educated university
[1:06:38] college
[1:06:40] great one
[1:06:41] no education at all
[1:06:43] god will bring them
[1:06:46] and when they come
[1:06:47] whether one word
[1:06:49] in the ellipse god will unhate
[1:06:52] whether time was god will unact
[1:06:56] he used the prophet as an example to us
[1:07:00] there was no beauty to desire a prophet
[1:07:04] that came
[1:07:05] the message the glorious message that
[1:07:08] shot the earth at this 20th century
[1:07:12] god was hiding with abraham
[1:07:15] and speaking to us
[1:07:17] he wants
[1:07:19] to know how he operates
[1:07:22] that is not the wisdom of man
[1:07:24] because he says my thoughts are not your
[1:07:27] thoughts
[1:07:28] my words are not your ways
[1:07:31] my thoughts are higher than your tongue
[1:07:34] my words are higher than your wish
[1:07:36] so therefore let me do it
[1:07:39] i have the knowledge
[1:07:41] i have the wisdom
[1:07:43] i created everything your eye could see
[1:07:47] i formed the light i created all things
[1:07:51] and i am the same god
[1:07:53] i cannot
[1:07:55] i lie not
[1:07:57] so at this hour what god is doing
[1:08:01] right
[1:08:02] you could see
[1:08:04] he was
[1:08:05] he is now bringing his perfect will to
[1:08:10] his bride his wife his perfect will he
[1:08:14] has taken us to let us know through our
[1:08:18] beloved brother pastor simon for us to
[1:08:21] know
[1:08:22] that things even in the message
[1:08:26] so-called message
[1:08:28] god has brought us up
[1:08:30] not us alone but everywhere that his
[1:08:33] spirit is moving
[1:08:35] because the true
[1:08:37] wife of christ are gonna leave those
[1:08:40] that are in the mess age
[1:08:44] because the message is progressing
[1:08:47] god's spirit is moving
[1:08:49] and it's not moving by education is
[1:08:52] moving by
[1:08:53] predestinated as he said
[1:08:57] jacob have i loved esau have i hate
[1:09:00] because eat everything based on the seed
[1:09:04] it's not your mother christianity won't
[1:09:06] get you in
[1:09:08] your father christianity won't get you
[1:09:10] in
[1:09:11] your husband christianity won't get you
[1:09:13] in
[1:09:14] white christianity won't get you in
[1:09:16] it's all about what jesus christ his
[1:09:20] seed
[1:09:21] and if it is his seed in you
[1:09:24] no matter what you do you are going to
[1:09:26] come out perfect
[1:09:28] because the seed of god
[1:09:30] does not commit sin because god
[1:09:35] is unchangeable god
[1:09:38] he's a reality god
[1:09:40] he is god that heals all our disease
[1:09:44] if you are sick
[1:09:46] let me tell you jesus has healed you
[1:09:50] already
[1:09:51] because the true seed of god in you
[1:09:54] let you all know uh you all know
[1:09:57] hey doctors tell me i have cancer you
[1:10:00] think i believe that i'm gonna die
[1:10:03] no
[1:10:04] i don't
[1:10:05] because unless god said so
[1:10:08] nothing can take my life
[1:10:10] i have come to that point i'm not joking
[1:10:14] the seed of god in me
[1:10:17] is stronger than any sickness
[1:10:20] the seed of god in you danny is stronger
[1:10:22] than any devil
[1:10:24] what devil can do to you
[1:10:26] what devil can do to you
[1:10:28] sisters what a devil can do to you
[1:10:32] don't give him chance
[1:10:34] let me tell you
[1:10:36] look him in the eye and says i am a
[1:10:38] child of god
[1:10:40] when he comes with a stretch
[1:10:43] you stand there
[1:10:44] and says i know who i am
[1:10:48] i have eternal dwelling me
[1:10:51] and i am a child of the king
[1:10:55] brother braham
[1:10:56] know who he was
[1:10:58] he know
[1:11:00] that he was the 20th century prophet
[1:11:03] he know
[1:11:05] that he was the one that have to fulfill
[1:11:07] malachi 4 5. luke 10
[1:11:10] luke 10 17
[1:11:12] he know all those scriptures
[1:11:15] so when he came to
[1:11:17] knowing who he was you think the devil
[1:11:20] could conquer him
[1:11:21] no
[1:11:22] that's why
[1:11:23] the word of god is passed on
[1:11:26] that's why christ came down
[1:11:29] when you are a bride and you know who
[1:11:31] you are and bring christ
[1:11:34] on the sea
[1:11:36] and when christ come on the scene
[1:11:39] you know what it does to you you light
[1:11:41] up
[1:11:43] darkness free
[1:11:45] darkness free from you
[1:11:48] all the time you are light up
[1:11:50] because christ
[1:11:52] is the light of the world
[1:11:55] is the light in you
[1:11:58] if you are light up
[1:12:00] what has satan got to do with you the
[1:12:03] thing that satan scared is
[1:12:06] light christ light
[1:12:08] the pill of fire
[1:12:09] certainly scared off
[1:12:12] so
[1:12:13] sister brother
[1:12:15] don't be afraid
[1:12:17] look away to jesus and walk in the light
[1:12:21] brother as you said
[1:12:23] when you are walking the light
[1:12:25] the devil don't want to come close
[1:12:28] the devil know
[1:12:30] as our pastor said you are like a hot
[1:12:32] potato for him
[1:12:34] and a hot potato he cannot eat
[1:12:39] he cannot eat a hot potato
[1:12:42] because he's so hot
[1:12:44] gonna burn his mouth
[1:12:46] let me tell you
[1:12:48] you the world talking about nichola bomb
[1:12:51] you
[1:12:52] my brothers my sisters
[1:12:55] you the spirit of god in you
[1:12:58] if they want to see the true negro
[1:13:00] you are that negro
[1:13:02] they can do nothing
[1:13:05] nothing you are more than that nuclear
[1:13:07] power
[1:13:08] you are more than conqueror
[1:13:11] you are more than everything
[1:13:14] you think you are
[1:13:16] god is hidden in your soul
[1:13:18] god is telling you
[1:13:21] when you look through his word in you
[1:13:24] he doesn't see you as a sinner he see
[1:13:26] himself
[1:13:27] and when god sees himself
[1:13:30] himself light up because jesus christ
[1:13:34] is the light of the world he sees
[1:13:37] himself
[1:13:38] that himself there's no sin
[1:13:41] that's what god looked
[1:13:43] into
[1:13:44] that's why god
[1:13:46] told david
[1:13:48] you are a man after my own heart
[1:13:51] don't you know we are the wife of christ
[1:13:54] we are the
[1:13:56] people
[1:13:57] after god or heart
[1:14:01] that's why god can never leave us
[1:14:04] listen i'm speaking play
[1:14:07] i don't know who is the bride the wife
[1:14:09] of christ
[1:14:10] but i know
[1:14:12] i am
[1:14:13] you must know for yourself
[1:14:17] you must know for yourself
[1:14:19] if you don't know
[1:14:21] cry out to the lord
[1:14:23] say lord
[1:14:24] brother coffee says he know
[1:14:26] he's one but he don't know about me and
[1:14:29] i don't know myself so lord help me to
[1:14:32] know
[1:14:33] help me
[1:14:35] help me it's not a joke
[1:14:37] it's not because oh brad then is
[1:14:40] powerful in the lord so his wife is so
[1:14:43] powerful in the lord and
[1:14:45] his wife is going with brother danny
[1:14:49] wait no
[1:14:51] we are going as individuals
[1:14:56] we are going as individuals
[1:15:00] jesus said to be in the bed
[1:15:03] i'll take one
[1:15:05] and leave one
[1:15:07] to be in the field
[1:15:09] i'll take one
[1:15:11] and leave one what did brad brahm says
[1:15:13] there are three classes
[1:15:15] of the message
[1:15:17] people
[1:15:18] believers
[1:15:20] make believers and unbelievers we are
[1:15:23] all sitting in there
[1:15:25] okay
[1:15:26] so it's not me to tell you you are an
[1:15:29] unbeliever
[1:15:31] it's not me to tell you you are make
[1:15:33] believer it's not me to tell you you are
[1:15:36] a believer we are just preaching the
[1:15:39] gospel
[1:15:40] the brothers just preach the gospel
[1:15:42] we just cast the net
[1:15:45] and the net
[1:15:47] we don't know who is
[1:15:49] but god knows
[1:15:51] that's why in this message
[1:15:54] we that have been here long
[1:15:57] we have seen one time where so many the
[1:16:01] church busted out
[1:16:03] then it goes broke there so many emboss
[1:16:05] it out
[1:16:06] sometimes the people you think they are
[1:16:08] strong
[1:16:10] they busted up
[1:16:12] right
[1:16:13] people that
[1:16:14] won't humble themselves
[1:16:17] they won't subject to the pastor
[1:16:21] the will of god
[1:16:22] that is leading
[1:16:24] they won't subject to the deacons
[1:16:27] let me tell you it doesn't matter even
[1:16:29] if you are deacon
[1:16:30] if he doesn't submit to god
[1:16:34] god will move you
[1:16:37] it doesn't matter you sit in the bench
[1:16:40] if you doesn't submit to god god will
[1:16:42] move you
[1:16:43] let me tell you this flesh
[1:16:45] is not of god every person
[1:16:48] this flesh is not of god we all make
[1:16:51] this flesh make mistakes
[1:16:53] but what if you are a child of god you
[1:16:56] make mistake that's why i always say i
[1:16:59] come with danny timber
[1:17:01] christopher
[1:17:03] brother mike whoever sister but if i'm
[1:17:06] wrong and god begin to speak to my heart
[1:17:09] for me to know i'm not ashamed
[1:17:11] i'll come and repent
[1:17:14] i always said that
[1:17:16] if i haven't seen it
[1:17:18] then i'm staying on my ground
[1:17:20] but the moment god begin to reveal to me
[1:17:23] i have to repent
[1:17:25] and turn to god
[1:17:28] the gospel so many come in the message
[1:17:32] they try to help
[1:17:34] things
[1:17:35] and god doesn't like it
[1:17:37] god wants everything on the table
[1:17:40] your lifestyle have to be on the table
[1:17:43] and if you are doing things
[1:17:47] it may be wrong
[1:17:49] in even people's eyes
[1:17:51] but if god likes it doing
[1:17:55] if you are doing right in people eyes
[1:17:57] and god doesn't like it stop it
[1:18:03] because god
[1:18:05] is the one that we look into
[1:18:09] but again
[1:18:10] you've been blessed
[1:18:14] he's being one as our pastor said
[1:18:17] one of the oldest in the church
[1:18:20] right
[1:18:21] you have seen so much brother mike
[1:18:25] then later maybe tim beer
[1:18:27] and the rest brother brian and cole
[1:18:31] coming
[1:18:32] then we
[1:18:33] came later without once came later
[1:18:36] no matter how you think you are weak you
[1:18:38] are stronger than what you think brother
[1:18:41] you are so strong in the lord more than
[1:18:44] what you think
[1:18:45] okay don't let the devil push you around
[1:18:48] you don't know nothing you don't know
[1:18:49] nothing so i'm i'm in the lord in my
[1:18:53] come on brother you are stronger
[1:18:56] you are stronger than what you think
[1:18:58] i'm just telling you from my heart and i
[1:19:01] believe it's god speaking to you
[1:19:04] he's telling you you are strong be
[1:19:06] strong in the lord you are not a you you
[1:19:09] a military guy you know how military
[1:19:11] behave i live in the barracks i know how
[1:19:14] so just be a no soldier when the trumpet
[1:19:17] sound
[1:19:18] and the soldier head will be down every
[1:19:21] soldier you see them running for their
[1:19:23] gun or
[1:19:24] sharp
[1:19:25] dress up ready to go because they
[1:19:28] understand the trumpet this is the hour
[1:19:31] when god is saying i'm bringing my
[1:19:33] children from north south east west and
[1:19:38] i'm pulling them out all the mess in the
[1:19:41] message
[1:19:42] i am pulling them out and i'm revealing
[1:19:45] myself to them individually and i'm
[1:19:48] calling them to know who they are so
[1:19:50] because some are depressed
[1:19:53] some have used intellectual to oppress
[1:19:56] god's children
[1:19:58] writing the message
[1:20:02] and god is saying no
[1:20:03] i can't worry that
[1:20:05] i'm gonna seek my sheep
[1:20:08] i'm gonna save them bring them out i'm
[1:20:11] gonna feed them i'm gonna punish them
[1:20:15] just
[1:20:16] dress them with my word and even you may
[1:20:20] look at them they are they are like
[1:20:22] nobody from beginning
[1:20:24] all of a sudden you see that ball
[1:20:26] coming to bone like uh i think joseph
[1:20:31] born in egypt
[1:20:32] they have to take it to israel right
[1:20:35] that won't have to come out from egypt
[1:20:39] because he can't stay
[1:20:41] shaking and panicking
[1:20:43] let me tell you when god there's no fear
[1:20:46] when you when god light you up
[1:20:50] no fear in you again
[1:20:52] as i stand here no doubt
[1:20:54] no fear i know who i am i am so certain
[1:20:58] of god
[1:20:59] and when i'm speaking
[1:21:01] i know god is on my side
[1:21:04] god is with me
[1:21:06] it doesn't matter whoever believe or
[1:21:08] don't believe
[1:21:09] i trust him
[1:21:11] and once i trust him he identify himself
[1:21:15] that he is with me that's all i worry
[1:21:17] about when
[1:21:19] anybody trusts me and god doesn't trust
[1:21:22] me i'm done
[1:21:23] but when god trusts me that i'm doing
[1:21:26] his perfect will that's what matters to
[1:21:29] me
[1:21:30] jesus christ
[1:21:32] will never fear us
[1:21:34] he will never forsake us
[1:21:37] let us put trust in him
[1:21:39] let us when we come to church worship
[1:21:42] him
[1:21:43] don't let your mouth or your joy cross
[1:21:47] let me tell you as you said it when
[1:21:50] queen elizabeth call you and tell you
[1:21:53] the whole world go he make you in charge
[1:21:57] and you're gonna take
[1:21:58] put some gold in all your clothes
[1:22:02] dress you with the best car which is
[1:22:05] rose rice
[1:22:07] and just inside with gold for you to sit
[1:22:11] in
[1:22:12] what you gonna do
[1:22:13] you go in a meeting and you're gonna be
[1:22:21] you go in a meeting like this
[1:22:24] once you are dressed with gold and you
[1:22:26] control the whole world goal
[1:22:28] don't you know that's what jesus has
[1:22:30] done to you
[1:22:32] jesus has placed himself in you
[1:22:36] the greatest thing that will strike the
[1:22:38] earth is not billions of dollars that
[1:22:41] delegate heart
[1:22:42] or not like the queen heart the greatest
[1:22:45] thing that will strike on this earth
[1:22:48] is jesus christ in your soul that's why
[1:22:52] brother abram said you could speak a
[1:22:55] word and go and live inside you can
[1:22:58] create your own world and go living
[1:23:01] because the greater that he that is in
[1:23:04] you that he that is in the world
[1:23:06] so be happy
[1:23:08] there's no sadness in christ
[1:23:11] there's no lukewarm in christ
[1:23:14] there's no
[1:23:15] laziness in christ
[1:23:17] we have to rise up and know who we are
[1:23:21] and walk with our chess board with no
[1:23:24] fear
[1:23:26] that we know who we are
[1:23:28] it is we
[1:23:30] that the world will come against

[1:26:04] you are going to judge the world
[1:26:07] work
[1:26:08] as somebody of christ on the edge
[1:26:11] now i'm taking my authority
[1:26:15] i'm taking my position
[1:26:18] before i thought
[1:26:19] i was
[1:26:20] nobody i am dummy
[1:26:23] i am literate
[1:26:25] i am no good i am this that's what i
[1:26:28] used to put on myself
[1:26:30] now god says no no no no no no
[1:26:33] no
[1:26:34] you are not like that
[1:26:36] i don't see you in those category
[1:26:39] i see you as
[1:26:42] myself
[1:26:44] my you are my spirit of my spirit
[1:26:48] born of my bones flesh of my flesh
[1:26:52] and through jesus christ he said i can
[1:26:56] do all things through christ
[1:26:59] what do you think
[1:27:02] you can do our things
[1:27:04] let me tell you
[1:27:07] if you are poor

[1:27:12] by revelation
[1:27:14] let me tell you
[1:27:16] nothing gonna come to you with your hair
[1:27:19] down
[1:27:20] i don't care how the world economy is
[1:27:24] my wife's sitting here
[1:27:26] long time someone used to preach i don't
[1:27:29] even have one cent in my pocket
[1:27:32] and i took my wife in toronto working on
[1:27:35] the houses we're going to houses to

[1:28:13] let me tell you every time i come here i
[1:28:16] get fill up
[1:28:18] yeah you may see me shouting crying it's
[1:28:20] hard his brother is there to cry this
[1:28:23] dad
[1:28:24] is because it's the love of god
[1:28:27] throwing through my heart the joy of the
[1:28:29] lord
[1:28:30] throwing through my heart
[1:28:32] okay because i'm seeing the holy spirit
[1:28:35] using the brother brother christopher i
[1:28:37] see him as a teacher i see
[1:28:40] timber preach with a power of god like a
[1:28:43] blimp stone and fire sometime i see
[1:28:46] danny teaching sometimes i see him

[1:28:51] philip coming i says oh my god you want
[1:28:54] me to stay away unless unless my dead
[1:28:57] bones

[1:29:23] listen money is good but money can bring
[1:29:26] happiness
[1:29:27] money without christ will be the
[1:29:29] miserable
[1:29:31] miserable in the world but then he knows
[1:29:33] he used to
[1:29:34] deal with millions of dollars and he was
[1:29:37] he himself said he was smoking cocaine
[1:29:39] and all kinds of addicts until god
[1:29:41] turned him around he cried out the seed
[1:29:44] of god in him cry out to god held him

[1:29:50] know how much he have he may not have
[1:29:52] that 10 million 20 million physically
[1:29:55] but he we want this one better than that
[1:29:57] 20 million
[1:29:59] is the truth we got to tell us it is we
[1:30:03] human beings we want proper talk proper
[1:30:06] this way proper
[1:30:08] time
[1:30:08] what's the time 12 something
[1:30:11] okay maybe 10 minutes time i stop
[1:30:14] okay
[1:30:16] proper proper preaching proper talk
[1:30:19] proper way of doing things with books
[1:30:22] and everything have to be conducted is
[1:30:24] that no no no that's not that's not me i
[1:30:27] love the way pastor sermons preach
[1:30:29] because you know what i see myself in
[1:30:32] the preaching because
[1:30:34] listen god knows me better than anybody
[1:30:37] he can't put me to a proper proper
[1:30:41] conduct with all kinds of education and
[1:30:44] no
[1:30:45] that doesn't work for me
[1:30:47] no no brother coffee brother coffee
[1:30:50] don't want that no no no no
[1:30:52] it's not my heart
[1:30:54] but i i want some men sometimes you
[1:30:57] preach
[1:30:58] this way that way this way that will
[1:31:00] drop here this way that and you talk and
[1:31:03] that's the way me i am
[1:31:05] you understand and i'm seeing everything
[1:31:09] all the questions
[1:31:10] brother mike you remember the day i was
[1:31:13] cramping up the chain with uh igniting
[1:31:16] them western road that's what i was
[1:31:18] seeing i saw god i told you i saw god
[1:31:23] because through that kind of preaching i
[1:31:25] don't care whether two or three i'm
[1:31:28] looking for god so my heart was burning
[1:31:31] seeking and i would do anything to seek
[1:31:34] my lord and god by his grace revealed to
[1:31:37] me
[1:31:38] and since that time
[1:31:41] listen
[1:31:42] dear little deadly
[1:31:44] uh and i'm so happy
[1:31:47] i'm so happy
[1:31:49] listen i don't have a hundred thousand
[1:31:52] or even five thousand in the bank even
[1:31:55] two thousand i don't but let me tell
[1:31:57] with this word of god
[1:31:59] i don't care how much a person have if
[1:32:02] god wants me to talk to that person i
[1:32:04] will talk
[1:32:06] and i will tell him god put into my
[1:32:08] heart
[1:32:09] even whether you're gonna kill me i'll
[1:32:10] say
[1:32:12] but as we grow immature if god says does
[1:32:15] it
[1:32:15] don't speak i don't want to speak
[1:32:18] if god says speak i'll speak
[1:32:21] that's the way i want to be god wants me
[1:32:24] to be and move the way god wants
[1:32:29] i want to do his will
[1:32:31] and know
[1:32:33] in your heart
[1:32:35] that the seed
[1:32:37] that god planted in you
[1:32:40] it cannot sing
[1:32:43] it will go back to god
[1:32:46] as god says it is it will accomplish
[1:32:50] every word of god
[1:32:53] that god sent here for
[1:32:56] and have confidence
[1:32:59] because when god designed you
[1:33:02] let me tell you we didn't design you
[1:33:04] with rob
[1:33:06] okay
[1:33:08] god didn't design his children with rag
[1:33:12] only sometimes the prophet our pastor
[1:33:14] has said it
[1:33:15] but god's children sometimes we want to
[1:33:17] walk with rags
[1:33:19] i have done it
[1:33:21] and thinking i'm carrying my cross
[1:33:24] at me alone and i'm taking the cross and
[1:33:27] nobody else all for
[1:33:29] jesus is coming
[1:33:31] shake off
[1:33:33] that spirit
[1:33:35] and know who you are
[1:33:37] and begin to speak if you are poor speak
[1:33:40] prosperity
[1:33:41] if you are sick speak healing
[1:33:45] if your
[1:33:46] children are not in speak them you have
[1:33:50] to speak not the pastor
[1:33:52] not danny not in beer not christopher
[1:33:54] not desmond not philip not brother
[1:33:57] callie
[1:33:59] once they get in the pulpit you think oh
[1:34:01] they have to speak for you brother of
[1:34:03] you will speak for you
[1:34:04] speak yourself
[1:34:06] jesus said why christ speak moses
[1:34:09] speak and go forward did i not commanded
[1:34:12] thee
[1:34:13] did i not place my word in thee
[1:34:16] i said when you speak i will perform it
[1:34:21] unless you don't believe me
[1:34:24] if you don't believe me then if there is
[1:34:27] doubt in your heart repent
[1:34:30] and speak and go forth
[1:34:33] the moment i begin to recognize that
[1:34:36] on my life
[1:34:38] i begin to speak
[1:34:40] i say lord i need a house
[1:34:43] i need a house from here too how many
[1:34:47] paul sitting here asking we used to go
[1:34:49] to orangeville

[1:35:07] dollar we used to go as soon as possible

[1:35:11] said this now i got it i got it i'm
[1:35:15] gonna put it to action

[1:35:25] god don't want you to be a pewarma put
[1:35:28] his word into watching
[1:35:30] because there's a work that you have to
[1:35:32] do
[1:35:33] nobody can do it
[1:35:36] and unless you stand up
[1:35:38] to the standard
[1:35:40] and begin to speak
[1:35:42] so i begin to speak

[1:36:23] every bone that belongs to you has to
[1:36:25] come to you
