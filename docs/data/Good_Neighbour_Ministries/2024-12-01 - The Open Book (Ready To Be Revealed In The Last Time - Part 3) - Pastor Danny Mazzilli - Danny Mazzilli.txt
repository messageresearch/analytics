praise God let's sing it amen God's attributes were manifested in this bright in this last day we have caught the Revelation by the last prophet message and we know who we are and what we're raised up

bless you Saints glory to God we're right there in Heavenly places aren't we glory amen that's what this message is all about amen the original lifeall that's what it's all about Saints that's what we're feeding on right now if there was anything else that we could possibly feed on we would but there isn't is it's all about the seventh seal being revealed in this day and in this hour and without it there is nothing for us we'd just be like another denomination come on yes sir there'd be nothing else because it was the opening of that seal it was the messenger of Malachi 4 the messenger of Revelations 10 1-7 without that we would just be just like any other denomination teaching just doctrines from the Bible we'd be probably caught up whether you know oh well it maybe doesn't matter about the Trinity oh yeah okay well you can have it that way there's many ways that lead to God that's what they say but then Jesus himself who walked on this Earth Emanuel God himself said I am the way the truth and the life no man comes to the father but by me amen praise God and so we got to declare the truth in this hour because it's only the truth that's going to set the people free amen welcome everybody into the house of the Lord this morning we are excited to be in the house of God we're excited about the word of God we're excited because we know that we're living in the in the end time amen the end of the End Amen and um uh these are these are times that where where the the true church she's just excited not because there's Great Tribulation that's going to come down upon the Earth of course that's not exciting for the Earth but that's Bible prophecy and if the people were willing to listen to Bible prophecy then they would be here with us they'd be getting into the churches where they know the word of God where Jesus Christ is preaching present truth that's where you'd want to be imagine Jesus walked on the earth and yet only a dozen people followed him and yet he was the Messiah he was the word made flesh for that day and all they could say was crucify him he's causing a disturbance oh my what a time we're living in Saints praise God hallelujah well listen next week we have our Christmas dinner right after the service today is the last day if you're going to make any changes today is the only and last day that there will be no last minute oh all of a sudden next week you want to be there I'm sorry because it's it's reserved seating they have to know the exact number the tables are all set everything once I give them the number today it's done so I just want to I know brother Chris will probably be reminding you but I'm letting you know too okay because there will be no changes after today amen praise God so uh American Thanksgiving how many knows that it was the American Thanksgiving amen you know it was just over 400 years ago that um many pilgrims came from England they wanted to um come to America where they felt that they could start a fresh new life there were many great um men that were amongst them Christian men that believed that uh you know that that that they could start a new life that they could that they could stand for the word of God in the way that they they believe the word of God and they landed on Plymouth Rock they came in on the Mayfield they came in on another boat and there was this one gentleman by the name of John withrop who was a who was a a a Christian minister and a and a leader amongst them and you know he uh one day was was uh Gathering the people together after he had landed there in Plymouth Rock and and he gathered the people and he said listen I want to I want to talk to you people I want you to know something that God has promised us and he said you know he said to them he he took scripture they said that he was he was like Moses he was like a comparable to Moses he took scripture right from Deuteronomy chapter 28 and he talked about and and you know here here's one scripture that he said and these are promises that the Lord was speaking to them because that's where America was just being established it was around 1630 and we know that they became a nation in 16 or 7 I don't know6 1776 but those pilgrims were the start of the United States of America and they said and it shall come to pass if Thou shalt hearken this is from Deuteronomy uh 28 verse1 if Thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I have commanded thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth now we know that was Moses talking to Israel but here he took that very scripture and here we are 400 just over 400 years later and this thing you know America if they could only see the condition that they're in today and all these blessings verse two shall come on thee and overtake thee if Thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the Lord thy God blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed shalt thou be in the field imagine all these blessings and you know what America became the greatest nation on planet Earth they reached Heights above every nation more financially powerful than every nation on Earth at to a point where you know where where God had blessed them but then it was in the 1960s where God had sent a prophet to speak to America amen praise God and if they could only recognize that their day had come amen praise God so we give thanks unto the Lord we thank God for our Nations we thank God for what he has done but God is done with the Nations when it comes to them hearkening unto his voice it's an unfortunate thing Saints but thank God he has a church a people that have recognized and hearkened unto his voice in this day and in this hour because God says all these promises they go to you if you hearken unto his voice amen praise God just wanted to comment on America and their Thanksgiving and uh we wish all our American brothers and sisters in the Lord a Happy Thanksgiving I know they have a true Revelation on Thanksgiving amen praise God it's not all about turkeys and dinner and and big wild parties it's about giving thanks unto the Lord amen praise God and so uh Wednesday night if you were not here uh I encourage you to listen in on Wednesday night's service Not only was it a Blessing by the word of God but there was also a missions report we thank God for the missions work that we are doing um we brought some pictures and and showed what we were doing on the mission fields in Ghana Africa amen we're building a church there we encourage you as the Lord would would lead you and direct you uh to to give you know we want to be we want to be a church that's Living Waters we want to we want to let it flow in we want to let it flow out amen we want to we don't want to be caught you know on on that last day with millions of dollars sitting in the bank doing nothing when we can actually do something for the kingdom of God Amen praise God I'm not saying we got millions of dollars in the bank but it's coming okay because God's got a work for us to do and I believe that we are willing we are surrendered money doesn't establish who we are come on it's by faith amen glory to God hallelujah hallelu that God can trust you God can trust putting a million dollars into your hand and you're not going to just hoard it oh I got a retirement to take care of there's enough for your retirement it's called the fund of Jehovah Gyra hallelujah amen praise God and so we thank God for what the Lord is doing through our missions we want to expand our missions we had a meeting with the missions Team part of the missions team on Thursday night we discussed other avenues that we want to support where we want to go and reach others that are that are in the service of the Lord I've been in touch with several brothers that are genuine Mission uh Mission anointed brothers that are doing the work of God that are that are uh going into places we you know brother Chris mentioned to me about the the work that's going on in Trinidad and how they're moving into the uh you know the inner parts of Guyana we want to be a part of that we want to get involved we want to be there amen we wna we want to know that that that that the Lord is calling that last one amen and the word has to go forth and we and if listen if we can't go oh let's send somebody amen praise God Amen so uh let's continue to support the missions amen and let's let the word of God go out and call that last one amen who has a prayer request this morning we're just going to pray quickly I've got a request here from my daughter Rachel she said Dad Dad Dad I need to sit down with you this morning I said okay what's up she says you know I've been burdened I lost a really good friend she lost a good friend there last week um and uh you know she says it's it's really burdened my heart and um and then you know I've got a job interview that's coming up and it's really burdened me it's it's making me ansy she says I need lots of people to pray for me I said no problem I know lots of people that love to pray amen you better watch what you ask for Glory to God Amen because God hears the prayers of his Saints if two can can just assemble themselves and agree on any one thing watch out God's going to do something amen praise God so let's go to prayer we want to remember brother Joshua I know brother Chris but let's keep him in prayer he's he's going to need a Total Restoration I believe there's going to be a tremendous testimony that's going to come out of that amen let's let's keep praying let's keep believing Saints father we're so grateful this morning Lord that we can bring these needs before a living God God who's present who's Mindful and you are already working on those requests Lord we know that you're already in the midst of it all father but we're asking once again Lord and we're thanking you Lord we we are thanking you for meeting those needs for doing a mighty work going beyond what they even think is possible Lord do it and Grant it father and let us receive testimony back of what you're doing and Lord as we approach your word this morning Lord we go with expectation in our hearts Lord that only you can can open that seal to each and every one of us Lord only you can unseal the mystery of your word and make it real to individuals individual Hearts this is not a time where it's all big great camp meetings and great speakers and and Great Gatherings this is a time where there's silence Lord there's silence in heaven because you are here and you are you are dealing personal with with each individual as they go into their closet and as they as they Ponder on the things of this of your word and they Ponder on on the messages that have been coming forth Lord won't you speak this morning Lord go into those innermost uh depths oh God and and do a great work and Lord let us leave here this morning just like those that walked Lord with you on the road Lord burning in their hearts oh God and then you came and you broke bread you broke the bread of life you you made the word live in their lives Lord grant it this morning that you would do the same in the name of Jesus Christ we pray and Lord we'll never fail but to give you all the glory amen and amen glory to God let's go to the word Ephesians chapter 1 we've been taking this scripture we want to expand on it we want to let the Holy Spirit speak to our needs through it and through the the the following scriptures that we'll be looking at here but we're talking about the open book the book has been open it's no longer a closed book it's open but that book is open and it's somewhere not somewhere but in someone in a body amen she's recognized that the book is open she realizes that the word has been unveiled amen it's not something that's coming it's something that is in progress right now amen having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times which is now he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him so so is there going to be any other Gathering Place that this is going to all culminate it's all in him he's got now he's talking about those that are called according to his purpose amen he might gather together and so in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated a according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will may the Lord add His blessings you may be seated amen glory to God it's like the the the the book is like his last will in Testament amen it's unveiling things that that that you know that that only uh uh you know the prophets of old they they looked into those things they peered into those things but yet they couldn't fully comprehend it because there would be an appointed time and season it would be at a at the dispensation of the fullness of time amen and that's why we we we title this to ready to be revealed in the last time amen it's it's in the last time that he's unveiling this word and making it real to you as individuals this is not about a big you know Gathering of people and you know we're going to we're going to rent a stadium and everybody's going to go there and one morning we're all going to go in the Rapture together no sir it'll be one here one there the Rapture is already in progress you've been raptured already your friends your family are wondering why they can't associate with you in the way that they used to you're different you know all you talk about is the word you love the Lord you you you look at everything and all you can see is prophecy being fulfilled in your life amen and in the world because you've been given the spirit of Prophecy upon on your life amen but God is God is declaring his great mystery let's go to the next slide he says here we read this last week Christ in the is the mystery of God revealed God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret but not anymore no sir he's making it known Hallelujah nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence glory to God you know why there's silence because the opening of the seventh seal was the coming of the Lord a lot of people are looking for him to come in the clouds they're wondering oh he's coming he's coming they're all in a they're in a million churches this morning and they're saying he's coming he's coming I'm here to tell you he's already come he's already working on his people he's already snatched them just like he did when he walked into the when he walked over to the Sea there and he said Peter put your nets back out again oh they were fishing they were looking for fish they were wondering my god let's fill the church we can fill the church with people we can we can go out there and catch them but there's a famine in the land for the word of God it seems like nobody really wants to hear the pure word of God Amen he said no Peter let's go out again let's go and drop the net again because because now there was somebody else stepping in the boat amen and when God stepped into your boat it changed your entire life amen glory to God hallelujah and there was something in you that you didn't know but it was sealed up God had sealed something in you from before the foundations of the world and there'd be a time when the word would have to come to life in you amen so that seven seal there was silence Jesus when he was on Earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know imagine because Jesus was the son of God but yet God was expressing him in the son of man time and season and that's why Jesus Jesus himself did not even know while he was bottled up in this human flesh he knew something he all he knew is I come to do the will of my father I do nothing L he shows it in other words God will showing him things as he was walking with the word amen he was the word made flesh and he was walking with the word but it wasn't until he had resurrected he had given up that body and moved into that into that that word body that theophany body where everything was made plain again amen praise God and he came to realize what this was all about he had to learn obedience the scripture said so don't think that he was all knowing when he was in there it was only what God would show him right that's why when he went to the Garden of Gethsemane he had to pray and he said oh God that human side of him he had to God had to separate from that Humanity to allow it to go to Calvary and fulfill the word of God Amen praise God he says he didn't even know he didn't know what when it was going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour and seven Thunders uttered their voices and John was forbidden to write it oh we're going to be looking at some things here I don't know if we're going to be able to get to it today but there's there's a lot right there oh boy glory to God Amen where's those seven Thunders why did he not get allowed to write it why oh Saints we've got some things here that the Lord is going to bless us with amen John was forbidden to write it see coming of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing he doesn't he doesn't know he has has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible and that's why we've been looking at all the different types and that's why if you look from Genesis to Revelation and you look at every character that that fulfilled a portion of the word of God you should be able to see Jesus Christ in there it should be as clear as a bell that's the one thing a lot of people don't realize as Christians if you've been given the Holy Ghost you've been given the spirit of Revelation that when you read the word it's not going to kill you the Bible says the letter kth but the spirit gives it life so it's going to give life to some it's going to kill others because some look in there and they see Trinity you look in there and you see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever do you see the difference and so this is what we need to realize amen praise God and so uh you know um as we look at this uh we realize that that God was was unveiling a supernatural plan that started from before the foundations of the world and today we want to look at more you know as every time I go to study and every time I go to continue and I and I start to review my notes all of a sudden the Lord starts dropping all kinds of inspiration and I say oh okay oh I see that yes Lord and I start to put it in into the notes and so I don't know how long this is going to go but let's just see what the Lord's going to reveal to us cuz I'm just as much under expectation as you are I hope you've come with expectation cuz if you have God will discern your need God will speak to your very heart amen praise God and so we're looking today at the open book let's go to the next scripture he says here in Ephesians computer wants to act up right now amen unto me Ephesians 3: 8 and9 unto me who am less than the least of all the saints is this Grace given every Minister and every son and daughter of God should have should you should identify with that because we are less than the least of all the saints when you think about all that they went through and all that they had to go through but yet this grace is given that we should be able to preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ this is unbelievable what God has made known to us in this day and in this hour we take it for granted sometimes we don't realize the the the value of the word that's been placed in our lives and how how we are so privileged by the grace of God that we can believe it because that's the that's the miracle listen listen I I could invite people to come here into the house of the Lord with cancer with a death sentence for six months they come in they get prayed for they get anointed with oil they leave they come back maybe one more time and they never see we never see them again and they're living their lives and everything's just fine oh they'll tell and say oh I went to this church and yes God delivered me you know and God healed me you know uh you know but yet that's not a miracle it's a miracle but the real Miracle is when they can receive the word not only is their body healed now but their soul has been translated by a new birth into the kingdom of God into a reality that God is their savior God is their Lord God is their healer God is their provider now he's not just concerned about your health he's concerned about every aspect of your life that's the relationship that we want that's what we're looking for and that's what a real person out there that's sincere in their hearts they should be looking to to identify with the word the word of God and let their lives be a reflection of the word not a reflection of their Church their teachings their doctrines well my my priest says this my pastor says that what is the word say if it lines up with the word what your pastor is saying amen glory to God amen but if it doesn't line up with the word like Jesus when he stood there in front of those Pharisees and he said you by your doctrines have made the word of God of none effect to the people they'll tell you to go and say 10 Hill mares and 12 our fathers and you're good to go for another week that's not the god that we serve no sir God wants to see a broken and contrite spirit one that's that's really come to God and said oh god I've I've I've made lots of mistakes and my life has been a mess without you and I need you now I need you more than ever hallelujah amen glory to God praise God and so here he says and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hidden God who created All Things by Jesus Christ so something was in God before the foundations of the world Amen and God wants to express it and so we want to look now let's go to the next slide we're going to be looking at the book we're going to be you know digging deeper into the book seeing what the Lord unveils for us amen and how we can identify with the word let's go to the next scripture Revelations 5 verses 1 to 4 amen praise God it says and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof now first of all I want to I want I want you to uh draw your attention to this I saw in the right hand of him how many was on the throne it didn't say them right it said him you see until we get to a place where we can identify who God is you are talking to the unknown God you might as well go to any church because you're going to need to know him in a in a personal understanding and by the Revelation that he's not in three different places no it's God one Elohim from the beginning one that sat on the throne him that sat on the throne amen praise God and here now he's saying and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look there on he said no man man no man so God is looking for a man really you mean that it's going to be some man that's going to actually take that book and open that book and unveil what's in the book God is saying here there was no man in heaven or on Earth praise God but listen here and look at he wept John he wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon why would he be weeping about a book why would he be so upset that no one could actually take the book and open the book like what's going on here you know that if you go back into the Old Testament there's very little said about any books but all of a sudden in the Book of Revelation here we have some event that's taking place because John was in the spirit first of all the Book of Revelation there's a lot of people say John must have been having some coochie when he was you know bringing all these Visions because there's all kinds of symbols and all kinds of riters and and dragons and and and uh you know a wh that s you know all these things like what is this all about well John you got to understand John was in the spirit and unless you are in the spirit unless you got the Holy Ghost on your life The Book of Revelation because Revelation means apocalypse not apocalypse apocalypse unveiling it's a book of revealing it's a book of Revelation God didn't hide everything into the book no no he placed everything into the book so that he could unveil it to whom he chose to unveil it and that's where that's where the people have to come to realize that they got to come God's provided way they want they want to they want to read the book they want to put their own interpretation on the book without the Holy Ghost because if you don't come God's provided way God's not obligated to show you anything God has a an order to his word amen and so the Book of Revelation it's it's it's symbols it's all kinds of things that are that are HID within that book and it's not in a in a chronological order either because people think oh well if I go to Revelations 1 and two you stop at number two you've already done 2,000 years of the church ages that's where the the the the seven Church a brother Brandon preached from those first two chapters in The Book of Revelation so we know it's not Christ ological but we also know that God was going to unveil the book in a certain time and season because we can go on and we can see now listen here go to the next slide in the fourth seal he says now then no one in heaven or in Earth or beneath the Earth was worthy to open it or even look upon it this is a great event that's happening right now and we need to understand why there was such a a a you know a a a time of desperation that John wept much he says oh my God he's saying you know was worthy to open it to look upon it and John wept because he could find no man because if that book was not taken out of the hand of the original owner where it had been lost you mean the book was in Adam's hand from before before all the fall and everything took place place yes yes sir that book was in Adam's hand and Eve's hand and went back after they forfeited their rights of the word the promises their inheritance they remember they controlled the Earth he he was an amateur God Adam was in the image of God hallelujah Adam was an expression of God you know let's read on he he's a he's an amateure God he was a Son of God and a son of God is an amateur God Amen and what are we Sons and Daughters of God and when we come into our inheritance and our adoption what do we become Sons and Daughters of God a portion of God and so we need to realize what this whole reason why John was was was under this desperation that that man needed to be found that somebody had to open this book amen and a son of God is an amateur God now that ain't contrary to the scriptures I know that sounds strange amen glory to God and so we need to understand something here we need to go back to the beginning in order to identify why Jesus was the actual sacrificial lamb that would in type Express Adam going to sleep so that God could produce a bride amen a wife Hallelujah and so let's go to the next slide we're going to read from Genesis 1 126 now we're going to read this because you know while I was you know studying and you know just feeding on the word and feeding on on on messages because I go and I feed I got to feed just like you feed if I don't feed I'm going to come here like a skinny man with soup and you guys are going to be leaving here with nothing you go come on man we're still hungry so so you know I'm looking for things that God is going to feed our souls amen praise God and so here I you know I I went back and and I looked and you look at conduct in order okay and you go back and you see that here brother brandham now okay after so I'm going to read I'm going to read something now after this quote here but Jesus said if you call them who the word of God came to and what does the word of God come to congregation says prophets amen the word of God comes to a prophet and we know that God is not going to break the cycle God is not going to break the way he does things and so all of a sudden now we've got to recognize that when Jesus said Elias has come but Elias shall surely come and one had already come so there was another coming of Elias there was another Prophet that was going to come that was going to introduce Jesus Christ for the second coming the first one was John the Baptist prepare ye way for the Lord but the second one is Malachi 4 Elijah who shall turn the hearts of the children back to the word we're now we're searching the word we're searching the scriptures and so if you call them who the word of God come to Gods how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God and now they were gods and man if you become born in the family of your family name you are a son a part of your father and then When sin come When sin came in we found out that man crossed the chasm and the blood of bulls and goats covered but did not remit until the real bleach came that bleach amen that could take the stain and sin and break it completely to pieces and send it back upon the original perverter that was Satan amen and so we need to understand this Plan of Redemption and how Jesus Christ and why you know the they're they're they're they're they're they're they're talking about the Lord Jesus but they need to see the true context of why Jesus went to the cross a lot of people just look at it and oh he went to the cross and he died for my sins but they have no Revelation that God had a plan in his mind that when he took Adam and he expressed Adam in his own image Adam was in the image of God in spirit form okay let's move on here so the quote here uh so it was a closed book the Bible is the Book of Life okay and there are thousands of Christian ministers and millions of people that are reading that Bible yet it's closed to them okay they're they're they're seeing Jesus Christ they're seeing that he came they're seeing that he went to the Cross but yet they're not reading the element of how they fit in to that sacrificial lamb and that how he went to the cross and they were in him when he went there when he rose you Rose and you're just identifying with the word for your day right now and it's showing that the resurrection's is actually in you that there's a part of God in you amen amen hallelujah so I got to move on here to to these notes okay so we're going to read Genesis 1:26 to 28 because we want to go back to the beginning and we want to see what God was doing go to the next slide and God yeah this is the one and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every living thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image that was the first creation of God when he created not the first creation but the actual first expression of himself in spirit man amen and so so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them so Adam was male and female so that tells us if Adam is in the express image of God then God is male and female that's right amen and God has this plan in the back of his mind about a wife and a Redemptive plan and the only way that he can do that he's got a he's got to let the logos his thoughts Express and become material and so he expressed Adam as a male and a female I'm I'm going somewhere with this so follow me okay and God blessed them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth you wonder why Adam and Eve did math every day is because God said replenish the the Earth and multiply Hallelujah we heard that last night it was it was it was nice to hear a clean joke and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea over the fowl of the air over the every living thing that moveth upon the Earth Adam was God in this Spirit form he was God in the fullness of of an expression because we are humans we use words we use books even the book that we're talking about I don't want you to be visualizing this this literal book you know when when we're talking about a book we're talking the Bible says that that that that that God is in the fullness of the volume he's in he's in the he's in the scripture he's in the volumes he's he's all he's he's in all and through all amen so when we talk about God we need to put him in his rightful place amen he's not somebody that's just written on letters he's not somebody that that that needs to use words because actually it's not words that you are catching here while I'm speaking and preaching the word of God it's faith that you are catching it's the logus the mind of God the spirit of God and we need to understand that this whole aspect of God and this whole mystery that God wants to unveil to us in these last days there's there's more to it that that's going to give us faith for a body change we're not going to get Faith for a body change unless God gives it to us there's more that God wants to unveil to us we're not going to just Rejoice oh the seventh seal is open the seventh seal is open why is it open what is it doing now what is how is it affecting me now how do I identify with that seal amen praise God hallelujah and so we need to see what God was doing here now here Adam is in spirit form Spirit man he's not separated yet let us make man in our image he said let them them God had this plan in his mind he didn't say Let Jesus he said let them because we're a part of the plan you're going to see how we are so important to the word of God how God needs us to recognize who we are why why you think brother Braham says when this Bride Comes to recognize this church comes to really recognize she's not just a churchgoing people that go to church every Sunday she's a people that's been anointed by the word of God by the spirit of God he walks with you he talks with you he lives around you he he changes circumstances you should have been killed in that accident but he said no not this time he he he dealt with your life in so many different ways because he had an appointed time for [Music] you Hallelujah so now the next scripture when we go to here Genesis 2: 4-7 these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth he had not allowed his Spirit his word to to to yet now come and and and start to manifest The Plan of Redemption all the seed was planted everything was in his mind was all planted in order but God has a time and a season for his plan because he knew before we before Adam fell with Eve he knew that there would be time he knew there would be season he said let the sun and the moon and the days and the nights be for times and for Seasons God knew that we would be entering into this he knew that there would be a time for all of this and here now he goes for the Lord God had not caused that that and and he says uh to re upon on the earth and there was not a man Adam was in the image of God but I want you to notice what he says here there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the earth so now God is creating a body for Adam who was in His image yeah to be placed into a glorified flesh body flesh and Bone body the life was the spirit of God there was it was eternal life that was in him at this point and now he fors and he breathes into his nostrils the Breath of Life all of a sudden now man has to breathe takes that first Breath of Life smells the air recognizes that wow this is a dimension this is something that the Lord now has created and that's why when we talk about the worlds were formed by the word of God we don't know how many worlds there were but we know that this is the world that God is dealing with right now and that's what we should be concerned about not about all the previous worlds amen but here Adam was experiencing a new reality God was expressing himself in a human form and within in him was the woman Eve now let's read on and he and he breathed the breath of life and Man became a living Soul now look verse 15 to 20 next slide and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely enter into time which is death death can only be identified to us because of time if there was no such thing as time there'd be no death and so at that God had already set up the garden that tree of Good and Evil that was Satan himself that was the serpent by their fruits you shall know them God God identifies TR trees in the Bible he talks about by their fruits you shall know them you know there's so many scriptures that identifies trees as people and the serpent was was very smart and God placed him there knowing exactly what the plan was going this is the Paradox you're going to need to follow me on this because it does lead to a place where we come to realize that God has a purpose remember this is all according to his purpose purpose and his will so don't be thinking that God is just playing games here God placed you on free moral agency you have the right to reject leave the church never come back or you have the right to submit yourself to the word amen and allow the word to transform you little by little faith cometh by hearing by the hearing of the word of God Amen God uses words to allow his Spirit to ride in glory to God Amen and so here now he says but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not y yeld die and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone so here now Adam created in the image of God Spirit man within Adam is Eve male and female called their name Adam read the scripture yes yes she wasn't even expressed yet but God knew who she was just like God knows who you are God knew you before the foundations of the world amen glory to God and so now he says it's not good that man should be alone I will make him a help meat for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them yes so look at the order of creation Now look how God is God is creating all of these things God has a purpose for putting every sentence where it is in the word amen it is perfect because God is perfect amen God is showing that that that he created all these beasts and Adam had a perfect knowledge of all of these animals all of these beasts he understood every single one of them he understood every foul of the air and he brought them onto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof he was giving Adam showing that Adam had the ability to speak the word to call whatever whatever he said that's what it was going to be Adam was was anointed to to know exactly who he was what he was doing and then look at the next sentence and then look at the very next sentence and Adam gave names to all the cattle the foul of the the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found an help meat for him he was waiting on God's time Glory he knew that there would have to be a certain time he was expressing something here let's go to the next verse 21 and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam you know what brother Bram said that deep sleep was he died Adam died put him into a deep sleep to show that there would be a second Adam that would have to come and die so that her so that his Eve could be expressed in a certain time and season God knew everything he saw it all in his back in the back part of his mind but look at watch what Adam does now and then and then so he put him into a sleep and he took one of his ribs and he closed up the flesh flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken AK from man made he a woman and brought her unto man why do you think she's called woman because she came from the womb of the man Jesus Christ's Church comes from his side she went to Calvary when he went to Calvary he came and died for her why do you think Abel why do you think he had a a revelation that it had to be a a bloody lamb to bring to God as a sacrifice he was he was one of the children that were born from Adam and Eve he had a revelation that it would be a lamb that would take away the sins of the world not flowers not not the fruits of the field but an actual lamb that would have to die a horrible death God revealing God showing remember we said he showing everything in type form through the scripture and so here now this is now now watch Adam he says he uh that that made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one what in 2 in Genesis 2:26 God was showing in Adam that he knew that there would be families that there was going to be time that there was going to be a fall you you mean Adam knew exactly what Eve represented that she was the part of him that was actually going to fall and cause what we call today the time warp where man has to go into time man has to die every sickness every death every health issue every broken relationship because of what took place in that Garden Adam knew his wife he named her immediately as she came out right when he saw her he knew who she was because Christ knows who we are he knows the time and the season that we're going to come to his word that we're going to recognize who he really is are you seeing a lot more here you know you may have read Genesis many times but we need to allow the spirit of God to show us what it is and why why this relationship is so important for you as the church because remember He restored Jesus Remember in the Garden of Eden it was Adam and Eve and the Beautiful Garden everything was was perfect before the fall because you know it goes on and and then and then they were in the garden and Adam you know he you know he he was saying that she's the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen you know that that you know brother brandham described it you know described Eve and how perfect she was until that serpent went up to her because remember God had a plan God wanted to redeem God wanted to bring forth his children God you were when he said let us make men in our who do you think the US were it was us we were in the mind of God before this whole plan and he was he was bringing this whole plan together and we're sitting back there going wow oh wow and he's he's talking and and and and and we're seeing all of this unfold because God is eternal God is omniscience there's not a time when he began there's not a time where he ends you need to place God in his rightful place so God could see everything that was happening and if we were there rejoicing with him before the foundations of the world until he said but hey guys I got to send you down to the Earth what do you mean you're going to go down there you're going to take on the human bodies because of the Fall because Eve is going to listen to that serpent who wants to bring forth of his own kind wants to be like God to be able to create Sons and Daughters for himself and that's why we've got a world that's full of Sons and Daughters of God and a lot of devils and they'll turn and they'll tell you there is no God I curse God I this God there ain't no God why do God allow this to it's because there's no attribute there's no representation they weren't in Adam they were created they came as a as a as a result of God's word which said let every seed bring forth of its own kind and when the serpent beguiled Eve and made love to her she brought forth two sons one that came from that serpent the wicked one and one that came from Adam because Adam knew that he'd have to give his life for Eve he saw the whole plan amen praise God let's move on and so now that we have this background that we've laid in here so that we can understand who we really are why it's so important to recognize and understand how we fit in to Christ and how it is that this whole plan that that that the Lord had from before the foundations of the world which is Christ The Mystery of God just listen to that Christ the Myster of God revealed so he's he's unveiling a whole plan and we're a part of it but we need to see our part because our part is very important we're going to come to realize how important it is praise God Amen so let's go now and and let's uh let's read on brother brandham here he now he he makes comments on on uh C regarding these scriptures now listen what he says here he's he's now bringing a clear understanding now he he gets a question now this is question one in COD book volume one you can go back and read it it I loved reading it especially under the context of what we're feeding on here and the question God created male and female created male uh man male and female now that's I think the first point brother Braham says now this is the question okay now now in Genesis 2:7 it says he formed underscored but first he created he's got then he's got that underscored and he formed Man Out of the Dust and breathed into his nostrils and so forth now what is the difference or where is the connection in the above scriptures the difference between uh Genesis 126 and Genesis 2 remember the spirit man Adam the glorified body of Flesh Adam where Eve comes forth so brother bradam speaking here he goes and he says now I need to reference now this brother brmp says I need to reference St John 4 verses 23 to 24 now this is the story of the woman at the well and you're wondering well wait a minute here where's where's brother Brenham going here all of a sudden he's going to to the woman at the well he's but listen he says now he says ye worship that ye worship and you know not what you're worshiping and that's the big problem and the big question of today the people don't know who they really truly worship you go to the Catholic Church they'll tell you we worship the Virgin Mary oh Jesus is important but we go through Mary because Mary's the mother and the mother of God will stand there for us and tell us hey this person gave a lot of money you got to let him in or this person prays a lot you got to let him in this person comes to church every day 8:00 4:00 who are they worshiping do you see what I'm saying they know not who they worship and here now he says we know what we worship for salvation is in in is of the Jews and that's right see this is what she said but the hour cometh but the hour cometh and now is that the true worshippers Jew or Gentile shall worship the father in spirit and in truth so here now Jesus is bringing a Clarity of why it's so important for for anybody that's truly going to worship God they got to have a revelation of what was in the mind of God right back at the very beginning when he created Adam in spirit form there was a purpose in all of that and this is where we're headed and so here I want you to keep that in the back part of your mind amen so so he's saying here for the father seeketh him to worship him now the the next verse is where I want God is a spirit God is a spirit he's making it clear and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth now if God created man in his own image and in his own likeness what kind of a man did he create a spirit man now if you'll notice after he had made all the creation and the created a spirit man uh to the the the Clos reading of this now pay attention the one that asked the question we'll find this that God give dominion of the cattle of the fishes and everything to the man but in his making up there he made man in his own image to leave lead the cattle lead the Beast of the field just like the Holy Spirit leads the True Believer of today and that's why it's so important when we say repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus you shall receive the spirit of God and the spirit of God Jesus said I will send you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost and he will guide you into all truth amen so we're seeing something here he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself Adam when he was when he said let us make man in our image and Adam was expressed that was God pure God but he was in spirit form in an image he was expressing himself he's going back to that we're going back to that unless we go back to that there is no eternal life amen that's what's written in the book these are the things that we need to look deeply into to see why John wept why it was so important but here now he's saying that that that Adam the first man he says then out of God came the logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us out of the logos came forth the man Hallelujah so when Elohim expressed the logos it was his thought going forth before it was even a word it was it was being expressed in in spirit form and that's why Revelation on the word of God is not something that you can you can learn Revelation is not learned you can memorize scriptures you can memorize quotes you can you can do all of those things but Revelation is given it's revealed that's why it's called Revelation that's why the Book of Revelation in the in the last book of the Bible it's it's a book that reveals the end time but God has to reveal it to you Hallelujah so man can't figure out God all man knows about God is that he's an object of worship when you talk about God they you ask a person what is God they'll tell you well it's it's some invisible force out there some some call it the universe some call it uh you know Source of Life some call it you know high levels of consciousness you know Darwin says it was the big blast you know all these interpretations on God but God sends us a prophet that goes right into the mind of God and is able to tell us that he he says I was looking out over the banister and the logos which was the light which was the word of God which was his thoughts went forth like a like a light and it was dancing in the universe and it was creating all the galaxies and it was creating all these different worlds and it was creating all these different planets and and then and then he saw that you know it created this Earth and and God had a plan for for planet Earth God allowed the prophet to see those things because he brought him into his mind and God by Revelation has given us the ability to see those things so that we can recognize how we fit in where we come into the whole plan Hallelujah glory to God listen it's just some object of worship to the people some people worship things they worship animals they worship movie stars they oh they they'll worship uh sports stars Oh They'll go there and and they'll they'll they'll sing with the singers and you'll see 10 100,000 people I could just imagine when when uh when that girl there was in Toronto the noise that was coming out of the uh the the Air Canada Center there praise God you know and the people were just mesmerized they're just caught right up into that Spirit not realizing there's a spirit there that is capturing the minds of our young people and sending them right into uh love lives of adultery and drug abuse and and and I know the words all sound really good but she's up there naked pretty much naked what kind of an example is that going to set for our kids if the movie stars can do it and they're my she's my favorite singer she's my favorite this that and all of a sudden they want to dress like them and all of a sudden you're 12-year-old daughter going to school all dressed in such a way that you're just my God what is is that that's a spirit that's trying to take our children possess their lives and destroy them amen but not in this body of Christ God has other plans he said you and your household shall be saved that's his promise they might not look saved right now but God gave them to you they're going to have to fight hell they're going to have to fight everything they're going to have to fight their way to hell and God's still going to snatch them out because while we were yet sinners he loved us oh the grace of God Saints let me tell you but God's grace amen glory to God so he goes on here and he says but of course we get off this question but I don't want to get too many you know because he says I don't want my mind he says I want you to see here where he made his first man was in his own image and then God before there even was a star knew that this world would be God knows everything do you think that God didn't know exactly you'd be sitting here this morning the Bible says he knows the number of hairs if you got any on your head I got a lot of hair you just don't see it but you will you may not recognize me over there but you'll recognize my voice hallelujah praise God but you see God knows you God knows you from before any Star anything was ever made because we are in him we are part of him we are in the Elohim we are the the the the the thoughts and expressions of God that's I can only describe these by words but they're only words you still have to go into the mind of God to really see how he loves you and how he adores you and how you are so much a part of him that he would have to die for you he would not allow you to go he says I don't care how much sin you got mixed up in I don't care how messy your life looks even right now I don't care anybody listening to my voice you could be an absolute total mess he said I will place your sins into the sea of my forgetfulness never to remember them no more that's what he said that's his promise we remember them we come under condemnation oh I did this oh I did that and God's looking at you and saying wait a minute here what are you talking about God's not an Indian giver God don't forgive and then and then and then remember it again we do as humans we got problems letting go of things that happen in the past somebody hurts you just one little bit never trust them again no sir that's your flesh talking if you could see the way God sees you he sees you through the the blood you're perfect you never done it in the first place I don't care what you did if you come to Christ and you really surrender and repent to this word he'll wash you and cleanse you you will you will walk free that's why Jesus said he that's heavy laden let him come unto me amen Oh Glory to God you got to see what happened back in the Garden of Eden you got to see what he was thinking before the foundations of the world otherwise you're going to look at man you're going to look at you're going to look at oh my mistakes you're going to look at the law you're going to look at all those things and you're not going to live by Grace because it's Grace that saves you glory to God he says he says and then God before there even was a star knew that this would this world would be he knew that I'd be William brandham preaching the gospel Hallelujah Dan misilli preaching the gospel he knew that from the pulpit and you would be J do sitting there listening to it before the world ever began Hallelujah now that's where people sometimes in the in the legalists and the Calvinists they get all mixed up you see they say why was some orain to be lost God's not willing that any should perish he didn't want no one to perish but yet God being God he knows there's some that won't accept it that's why you go to talk to somebody about the word of God you'll tell them about the proper baptism you'll tell them about you know Salvation in Christ and and how you know he he took your place and everything else they'll say nah I like Buddha I like Muhammad's teaching I like this new age stuff I like the fact that I can live this life I can party and I'm going to come back again and I'll get to do it all over again that's that's the kind of stuff that they're believing they have no Revel ation of God in spirit and in truth the legalist they say why why is so God not willing he don't want no one to perish but yet being God he knows that there's some that won't accept it see he's God he had to know the end from the beginning in order to be God he's God I'm just using the word God but you can't even put a word on him no there's no word that can describe him everybody in the Old Testament the rose of Sharon the the lily of the valley you know that David would get so caught up dancing in the spirit like there was no name that that that you could possibly put on him because of his love and his grace and his ability to come back and say things like he did to David he says blessed is the man whom I do not impute iniquity David was in a place where his life was a mess and God's mercy and Grace comes and says I wash your iniquities away I don't even remember them no more you know what iniquity is when you do things you know you're doing it it's wrong you continue to do it but God turns around because you repent and you come to him and you know that you're naked before God you've come to realize that he is God and then he wipes your sin away see he had to know the end from the beginning in order to be God he did he knew he was going to have some women so he just made their Spirit right there the Bible said he did in Genesis 1: 126 he created he him man and the prefigured male and female amen see in a prefigure he made the woman and the man before they was ever formed Out of the Dust of the earth glory to God why is that so important and then God made the man not in his own image this body is not in the image of God this body is in the image of beasts listen what he says here now notice man God knew in the beginning that he was going to have men and women and he knew that the Savior would be there would be here and he'd have to bring Jesus and he'd be the the he'd be crucified and Jesus told the disciples when was here on Earth that he knew them even before the foundations of the world he knew exactly what he was doing when he came here because God had showed him that he came for his own he came for his own when he came for for for for Israel they rejected him for the purpose that he could take a gentile bride remember everything's in type form so if you go back into Genesis you'll read all about Joseph and how Joseph was a was a a Jew and yet Joseph you know he was sold for you know for silver from his brothers for 25 30 piece of silver Jesus was sold for silver you know by his own amen by by uh you know and showing that that that Joseph had to go to prison just like Jesus had to go to the Cross but then Joseph was was risen out of the prison just like Jesus came out of hell after he rose from the dead and he was seated at the right hand of the father and Joseph was seated at the right hand of the Pharaoh which was God on Earth at the time you see all the types and did you know that Joseph had a wife and his wife was Gentile and when he revealed himself to his brothers just where we are at right now where God is going to reveal himself to Israel like Joseph revealing himself to the 12 tribes of Israel the 144,000 where was his wife she was in the palace Hallelujah she was a gentile bride and she was gone in the Rapture glory to God just before this whole earth goes into a a a big mess and God has to go reveal himself to Israel God takes his Gentile bride and puts her into a three and a half year honeymoon glory to God Amen Hallelujah and God also said Paul speaking in Galatians said he ordained us and called us in him before the world was was ever formed think of that that God anybody would like to hear what the scripture says about that raise your hand it goes right along with the question get with me in Galatians no he says it's no he says I don't mean Galatians I mean Ephesians listen here closely now what God Said in Ephesians 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus to the faithful in Jesus Christ be grace be unto you and peace from God the father and from the Lord Jesus Christ now when you hear that peace be unto you from God the father and the Lord Jesus Christ not talking about two people no he is God the father and he is the Lord Jesus Christ that's why Lord is the lord of the Old Testament Jesus God the word made flesh God With Us God above us in the Old Testament God With Us in the New Testament God God now in US amen for this New Covenant of calling the bride and bringing Eve back into the fullness and the Oneness of the spirit man that that is going to have dominion again over this Earth hallelujah praise God and God our Father the Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places now here here it is notice according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundations of the world pH he says that's pretty good isn't it that's not pretty good that's real good before there was a foundation of the world God knew Orman Neville he knew that he would be here that he's a member a a a member of the church and God knew he was going to have that church and he said Paul speaking in the Church of Ephesus said he has chosen Us in him he's chosen Us in him where was Eve in Adam what was Eve she was every thing the same as Adam she was a part of Adam she was bone of his he says bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh and the bride the church I can show you scriptures that says that the church the bride of Christ is bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh because we are being restored back to our rightful position as Sons and Daughters of God Amen that's not he says he says he chose why he a member of the church and he said Paul speaking to the church in Ephesus he chose us he he chose you and God before the world ever for was ever formed chose you and I and him before the world was ever formed woo my isn't that wonderful he says now the first man now he made the first man in His image and we are returning back to that image that's right to our first created image so we're going back before Adam and Eve Hallelujah glory to God what a what a time what a season we're living in Saints this word is just gonna is just going to uh just expound and and get greater and and our minds are going to absorb and and little by little your heart do you know that you know that God wanted to live in man amen you know that your heart brother Braham say there's a space in your heart where God Place himself and you know that it's surrounded by four arteries main arteries that come in like the four the lion the man the eagle and the Beast do you know that your heart is surrounded by 24 Elders ribs God was showing that his throne he was expressing it he was everything that was in his mind he had it all clear in his mind God's God's plan is so perfect and that's why man no matter how much man tries to disprove God he'll be a million miles further away you cannot disprove God he is mathematically perfect he is absolutely perfect in everything he knows the number of hairs on your head he knows how many times you'd bat your eyes he knows how many times your heart would beat how you going to go up against something like that you can't beat that you better join them Hallelujah he's but but the thing is is he he joins you amen he brings you he says my sheep hear my voice let the musicians come Hallelujah next week we're going to be looking a little further down the road here I'm just going to read uh the next scripture as we close here in Revelations 5 and then we'll continue right from here now next week he says and one of the elders saith unto me weep not oh this is this is where it gets really good because all of a sudden John in the previous few verses he's he's freaking out he said we can't find a man we can't find anybody that's going to loose the seals and and and open this book because if this book ain't open all of all of humanity is going to be lost that's it can you imagine yeah you mean that's really how important we are to the Lord Oh Glory he says weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book amen hallelujah glory to God Jesus Christ from before the foundations of the world the Lamb of God God's plan God was not going to leave us to be lost Hallelujah why do you think he calls it Redemption Redemption is to take back something that was already yours you can't be lost if you wanted to be lost you can fight all you want but if this word is striking your heart this morning if it's becoming a reality to you and you're hearing God speak to you in your heart and you know that this is real this is not some Fable this is not uh Mr uh misilli up there preaching a sermon he just put together some quotes and took some scriptures no there's a supernatural element to the word of God there's Faith that's that's moving the the spirit of God the the pillar of fire moving through your hearts and searching into your hearts and looking to see if there's any unbelief there so he can uproot it and set you free amen praise God he says behold and he loose the the to to to loose the seven and behold and lo in the midst of the Throne of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne and you would look at that and say woo wait a minute here who is this guy nobody takes anything from God nobody walks up to the throne and says give me that book he took the book that wasn't God Jesus another person another Beast a lamb and walks up and just takes the book out of the hand of him that sat on the throne no that was God expressing just like he did when he started in in in the before the foundations of the world and he expressed himself self and he he he made himself an image of himself and he showed that he would come down through the scriptures he would emor himself he was the great mzc the one who had no father no mother no beginning and no end who was that who can possibly be a person that has no beginning and no end and yet he shows himself to Abraham that was God he was manifesting himself in that office so all God was showing here when the lamb was what that had been slain had paid the sacrificial price he was now going from lamb to King to where he would take the book and now take that book because he's got a job to do he's got the other part of him that he needs to go and find that he needs to go and redeem that he needs to positionally place back into her rightful position so that they can rule together amen we'll look at that next week praise God hallelujah
