[55:02] know confus or anything like is I want
[55:05] to present the
[55:07] Simplicity of the Gospel of our Lord and
[55:11] Savior Jesus Christ amen because all
[55:15] them things could come on after amen
[55:18] hallelujah so the simpleminded ones
[55:21] could understand it amen
[55:24] hallelujah
[55:25] for when we were yet without Strength In
[55:28] Due Time Christ died for the rich
[55:36] man for the good man for the righteous
[55:41] man the one who could pay his way into
[55:44] the
[55:46] kingdom he died for
[55:49] theod died for me he died for
[55:52] you every single one of of
[55:56] us
[55:58] my for
[56:01] scarcely for a righteous man will one
[56:05] die yet poor Advent Here for a Good Man
[56:10] some would even dear to die so we all
[56:14] know not one is righteous how can un
[56:17] righteous are dirty thing make something
[56:21] clean you see man you see under the Old
[56:25] Testament in the Old
[56:28] Testament the blood sacrifice was only
[56:31] given as a covering for
[56:36] sin amen it could just cover their sin
[56:40] but you need to
[56:42] have a n
[56:46] change and without the shedding of
[56:50] blood there is no remission for sin
[56:56] so God was just giv in type in the Old
[56:58] Testament of what he's going to do in
[57:01] the New Covenant in the new in the New
[57:04] Testament amen
[57:06] hallelujah praise
[57:10] God but God
[57:14] commended his love towards us that while
[57:18] we were yet sinners Christ died for
[57:23] us so God expressed his love for each
[57:28] and every one of us here this
[57:31] morning that he died for
[57:34] you he died for me you
[57:38] see when Adam was created you see Adam
[57:43] represented the whole human
[57:47] race all God's seed was in
[57:52] Adam all the G matized seed that God was
[57:57] going to be sending throughout the ages
[58:00] was in
[58:01] Adam amen and he was a representation of
[58:06] you and me so may be asking this morning
[58:10] right why did we have to die when Adam
[58:17] sinned you ever ask yourself that
[58:19] question and a lot of people might ask
[58:21] that you know he did the wrong why we
[58:24] had to pay for it but we he was
[58:28] representing Us in him so when Adam fell
[58:31] we all fell in him amen amen
[58:36] hallelujah praise God so Jesus now the
[58:41] Lord himself God himself had to come and
[58:46] pay that penalty for all those seed
[58:50] jamati seed that was in Adam he had to
[58:55] pay the price to reconcile us back to
[58:59] him because God cannot die
[59:03] hallelujah amen and when you see us go
[59:07] that way he had to do something it was
[59:10] all in his
[59:11] plan his Plan of
[59:15] Redemption amen because in God there
[59:18] were attributes of being a savior we
[59:21] hear these things over and over again
[59:24] but someone here this morning needs to
[59:26] hear that yes
[59:29] siren
[59:31] Hallelujah that Jesus pay the price for
[59:36] you that you could go
[59:39] free you can't do it amen you couldn't
[59:43] pay that price amen so God so loved the
[59:48] world which world he said Jesus died for
[59:52] the whole world yes he did but but he
[59:55] died for those that were lost
[59:58] am Amen to bring them back because as I
[1:00:02] said God cannot die amen and he said I
[1:00:06] have every single one of them and I have
[1:00:09] to redeem them I have to bring them back
[1:00:11] I have to buy them back I have to take
[1:00:14] them out from the prison house Satan's
[1:00:16] prison house so the penalty for that
[1:00:19] blood caused sin so blood had to be shed
[1:00:23] to redeem back us to
[1:00:25] him amen hallelujah amen you see this is
[1:00:30] simple isn't it isn't it simple the
[1:00:34] Simplicity of God the gospel amen
[1:00:38] hallelujah praise God thank you Lord
[1:00:42] Jesus much more then being now justified
[1:00:47] by his blood now what is it meaning are
[1:00:50] Justified amen imagine
[1:00:53] this amen
[1:00:55] you did something wrong man and when you
[1:00:58] go up to the judge you going to
[1:01:01] say what is the
[1:01:03] accusation where's the evidence I don't
[1:01:07] see no evidence of this person doing
[1:01:09] wrong thing and that what Jesus do all
[1:01:13] the wrong that you did amen is been
[1:01:16] blotted out hallelujah amen it's not
[1:01:20] there in God's books it's not is him in
[1:01:22] his mind so Satan have no thing to bring
[1:01:26] up and accuse you of because it's all
[1:01:29] blotted out you're going to say what
[1:01:31] kind of Judges is come on he's an unjust
[1:01:34] judge you mean to say I bring up
[1:01:37] accusation at this person and the lawyer
[1:01:40] for this person don't have any evidence
[1:01:43] to show that the person did wrong glory
[1:01:48] amen so what is the accusation there's
[1:01:50] none Satan has nothing he could accuse
[1:01:54] he accuser of the Brethren but he has
[1:01:56] nothing no evidence to accuse you
[1:02:01] [Applause]
[1:02:03] of Amen my hallelujah praise God thank
[1:02:10] you Lord
[1:02:11] Jesus and here we read in in verse 12 in
[1:02:14] Romans wherefore as one man sin entered
[1:02:19] into the world and death by sin so death
[1:02:23] passed unto all men
[1:02:25] amen that's it
[1:02:27] Hallelujah so one man calls everything
[1:02:31] amen and why the whole world have to go
[1:02:35] through the whole thing so one man had
[1:02:37] to redeem all the
[1:02:40] Lost amen hallelujah praise
[1:02:44] God now we speaking this
[1:02:48] morning and what is your
[1:02:53] experience think about about
[1:02:55] it
[1:02:57] Hallelujah we have so much experience
[1:03:00] that life as we say life is a life this
[1:03:03] life is full of
[1:03:06] experiences amen you could experience
[1:03:10] hurt in your life you could experience
[1:03:13] joy in your life you could experience
[1:03:15] peace in your life amen but do you want
[1:03:18] to experience the grace of our Lord and
[1:03:22] Savior Jesus Christ

[2:04:50] and the brothers and the Brethren were
[2:04:52] praying and we were praying for them so
[2:04:54] we we prayed for them and then I started
[2:04:57] with my family I prayed for my children
[2:05:00] my husband I prayed for what he would be
[2:05:02] praying for and then I got to this
[2:05:05] ministry and I felt a touch on my
[2:05:09] hand so I didn't think too much about it
[2:05:12] because I got to a place where this was
[2:05:15] really serious to me this ministry me
[2:05:18] means a lot to me cuz this is my family

[2:06:05] him but then the Lord answered on the
[2:06:08] long list that I gave him he said I give
