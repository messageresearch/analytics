zone and learning as much as you can to achieve as much as you can amen [Music] Hallelujah but here's the cool part it's often the journey that is the most fulfilling part it's during these seemingly small insignificant moments that you often find that area moments that help you answer the question it's during a Christian War where God steps in in this simple quiet and ENC and let you know he with you amen thank you Lord the most discouraging times of your life when you think all hell BR against you all opposition is against God steps you yes and encourage you my child you're on the right amen

hallelujah thank you Lord praise God for anything you don't do by faith is sin that's right it's God to be by faith so how can you do something that is not right because inside of you is telling you it's wrong the conscience saying is wrong it shows you around so if it's uncertain you better leave it alone cuz that might be the one that keeps you out of the kingdom of God just as what she did
