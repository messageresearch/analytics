[0:14] at our title tonight is lent to me time
[0:18] it's the hour that you know things
[0:22] really start to company and we need not
[0:26] so much to be looking at others around
[0:29] us and all the circumstances we need to
[0:32] be looking at our walk and looking to
[0:37] see what it is that the Lord is
[0:39] requiring us in this hour because God
[0:43] didn't just decide about I'll choose
[0:46] there than ever hope she was for her and
[0:48] you know maybe this one here looks
[0:51] pretty good she's pretty this one's good
[0:54] you know it has nothing to do with any
[0:56] of that
[0:56] it's all because God had a wonderful
[1:02] place God so let's pray then we'll go to
[1:06] the word tonight and if you can pray and
[1:09] you're in need of something to might
[1:11] have the Holy Spirit will meet your need
[1:15] praise God that's what the cavity that's
[1:17] why it's so important for us together
[1:21] what a privilege and what an honor it is
[1:24] to gather with saints of light precious
[1:28] baby oh god it just pleases you father
[1:33] when there's faith in the house and that
[1:36] there's desires and needs or God and
[1:39] it's based on green or based on you know
[1:45] so likes and dislikes but it's based on
[1:48] the power of the Living God deliver to
[1:52] meet needs to challenge Lord that your
[1:56] word is true and that Lord that your
[1:59] promises you never fail to honor your
[2:02] word and your promises and with the
[2:05] people gathered in that way when they
[2:06] know they are they know why they've been
[2:09] elected why they've been called an
[2:12] abrasive of pain and a presence in the
[2:15] house and people can just Lord be
[2:17] blessed and receive that which they have
[2:20] beaten and that is our desire to pay
[2:22] sincerely father that we would just
[2:24] fellowship with you and let your spirit
[2:27] come and minister to every lead Greta we
[2:30] pray father we just commit every need
[2:32] into your heads Lord those that are not
[2:35] present Lord may it be with that watch
[2:37] over them all the current requests that
[2:39] have been going on all the needs that
[2:41] have been his soul relevant this week in
[2:44] the hearts of your children Lord may
[2:46] there be an answer tonight father may be
[2:49] something that we could leave here
[2:51] insane was good to be in the house of
[2:53] the Lord blessed be a wonderful name in
[2:57] Jesus
[2:59] [Music]
[3:05] so let's head back to chapter 25 verses
[3:08] 1 to 13 very familiar we're just going
[3:14] to look at it a very simple way the Holy
[3:17] Spirit is gonna you know give you what
[3:20] you have made and show you where you are
[3:22] what you know we're the time of the
[3:25] season that were living in because of so
[3:28] relevant that we know the time you know
[3:31] the season we know what God requires we
[3:34] you know God has always made it clear
[3:37] and simple when he wants to make
[3:40] something no he just brings it to pass
[3:42] you just simply use it some people to
[3:46] manifest his word and that's how he
[3:48] interprets his word he's his own
[3:50] interpreter
[3:52] Matthew 25 he says then the kingdom of
[3:56] heaven will be like ten virgins who took
[4:00] their lamps and fell to meet the bride
[4:04] by foolish and five were wise those who
[4:10] were foolish what they took perhaps they
[4:13] took no oil with them otherwise they
[4:17] took oil in their vessels with their
[4:20] lamps a lot of the privately delayed
[4:23] they all slumbered and slept but at
[4:26] midnight there was a cry behold the
[4:31] cried through is come come out to me in
[4:35] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[4:38] their necks notice they all through
[4:41] their lives the bluish said to the wise
[4:44] give us some of your oil for our lamps
[4:47] are going out of the lives as
[4:51] and what if there isn't enough for us
[4:53] and you you go rather to those who sell
[4:57] and buy for yourselves while they might
[5:01] away to buy the bridegroom came and
[5:03] those who were ready went in with him to
[5:07] the marriage feast and the door was shut
[5:11] afterwards the other virgins also came
[5:13] saying Lord Lord open to us but he
[5:18] answered we'll certainly I tell you I
[5:21] don't know you watch therefore for you
[5:25] don't know the day or the hour in which
[5:31] God bless you Lord on his blessings of
[5:33] the word tonight wow you know we read
[5:43] this and we the current preached over
[5:46] and over again and you know every time I
[5:49] read that scripture it just excites my
[5:52] soul it just gets me so excited because
[5:56] I know in this day in this hour the key
[6:00] to the to the door the key to a lot with
[6:03] God the key to know that you recognized
[6:06] your David's message is that you know
[6:09] that you've received the Holy Ghost
[6:12] without the Holy Ghost it's impossible
[6:15] it's impossible to please God and the
[6:18] Holy Ghost is faith the Holy Ghost is
[6:20] Christ himself come to you in a personal
[6:24] way and come to you
[6:26] correctly at certain time in your life
[6:29] that you thought you know that you know
[6:31] many of us have different testimonies be
[6:33] come from different backgrounds we come
[6:36] from different situations a lot of us
[6:38] you know we have been in a religious
[6:40] environment you know where we were
[6:43] product and in the church believing you
[6:46] know Bible believing family where you
[6:49] know they went to church every week you
[6:51] know you could have been a Catholic you
[6:52] could have been a Baptist you know the
[6:55] Presbyterian whatever your background
[6:57] was it really became you grounded with
[7:01] only goals came into your life
[7:03] everything that you thought maybe that
[7:05] you needed and everything you thought
[7:08] that by tradition you thought that
[7:10] everything was going to be fine then you
[7:12] know you could you could just go to
[7:13] church like like myself you know when I
[7:15] was young
[7:16] I was an altar boy and I would go to
[7:19] church and I would go on Sundays you
[7:22] know because my sister was born every
[7:23] week and I thought you know I would be
[7:26] you know able to go there and because
[7:28] she would be up there singing all the
[7:29] time and I would be up there ringing all
[7:32] the time you know and I thought that
[7:34] that was you know that was a way of
[7:36] feeling justified that you know you know
[7:40] somehow God was gonna you know do
[7:42] something or that you know I would you
[7:45] know go to heaven one day you know it's
[7:46] all these conceptions in our mind and
[7:48] then there was a lot of people you know
[7:50] some they went to church every week and
[7:53] you know they would pray and it would
[7:54] give they would go out and believe you
[7:57] know Lord
[7:59] very work and they would you know live
[8:03] live forgot they were they were living
[8:05] and they could be good by works they
[8:08] could outshine you a million lives but
[8:12] yet let the Holy Spirit King regardless
[8:16] and I'm talking about look now when I
[8:18] talk about the Holy Spirit I'm talking
[8:21] about the revelation for your day
[8:23] because that is the evidence of only
[8:25] ghosts and God comes to the individual
[8:29] the Living God the mighty God the God
[8:33] that wants to manifest his word the
[8:35] thought that one supreme reality to look
[8:38] to the people and to the to the
[8:40] generation he comes and he interprets
[8:43] his own word and when he came to you as
[8:46] an individual you you had no idea that
[8:50] what was gonna happen to you you had no
[8:53] idea that you were gonna actually come
[8:55] in contact with the Living God
[8:56] and this is what we're talking about in
[8:59] this hour and what we read about this
[9:01] scripture here we hear of wise and
[9:04] foolish virgins you know it really
[9:06] starts to hold it you know because it's
[9:09] not that we're looking for you know that
[9:12] we look out there and we see all the
[9:14] different churches you know 2000
[9:16] different
[9:16] operations out there and we thought
[9:18] that's the coolest virtue no it's not
[9:22] the foolish virgin remember she's a
[9:27] virgin she looks just like the bracket
[9:32] but there's a big difference
[9:34] one has an attribute that has a purpose
[9:40] in order to fulfill God's plan and the
[9:44] other has religion teaching clothes all
[9:54] kinds of you know history all that was
[9:57] brought up in the message I was you know
[10:00] I was you know every I was in the
[10:07] message that's great that's fantastic
[10:11] but that doesn't mean that you're in the
[10:15] classical lies hurt see we're gonna
[10:19] we're gonna look at things that that you
[10:21] know sometimes you know we knew we were
[10:23] poor
[10:24] this is a holding time this is this is
[10:26] where the the metal hits the road this
[10:29] is into the road
[10:31] this is you know this is where it's
[10:34] gotta count you know this is the last
[10:36] mile this is where everything comes
[10:38] together where there's gonna be a time
[10:41] where we are gonna see this world
[10:47] three and a half year period there's a
[10:50] lot you have to happen that rapture is
[10:52] coming to pass whether whether we think
[10:55] we're going to do it whether we are
[10:57] doing it on it it's because God's plan
[11:00] is good people fill it about turns over
[11:03] tongue and it's gonna go and one for you
[11:06] you think you're ready are you you
[11:08] you're wondering are you this is not a
[11:10] time for her for wondering it is is the
[11:13] time for you gotta know is doing
[11:16] something to this day to this hour and
[11:18] then your apartment and that you're
[11:20] feeding on revelation your be instructed
[11:23] on a regular basis by the revelation of
[11:26] God's Word this purpose is plan is
[11:30] destiny pop develop you're not just a
[11:32] church member in deep belong to this
[11:34] church and you can wander in Megiddo but
[11:37] it's convenient for you you know and you
[11:39] know you've got an opposite you think
[11:41] but I don't have to be there on time
[11:46] this is the house of the Lord this is
[11:50] this is where God meets with his people
[11:55] this is working he has a plan he has a
[11:59] ministry in it and it starts writing
[12:02] them from the sunday-school with the
[12:04] young people of the young children and
[12:07] God deals with this is his little babies
[12:09] and entities he's positionally placing
[12:13] each and every one of us even her
[12:16] children you wonder you think God just
[12:21] getting you children or do you think
[12:26] that God no in the end from the
[12:28] beginning knew exactly
[12:32] exactly which one he was gonna use to
[12:35] keep you on your knees exactly which one
[12:39] he was going to use to be an example to
[12:41] some of the other young people and you
[12:43] might think because no people well my
[12:45] children are like this listen you guys
[12:51] see God's pardon yeah this is not a book
[12:54] you're like your family and your little
[12:59] domain this is a body movement this is a
[13:03] season where the pride moves it into her
[13:07] position by the faith she walks by faith
[13:11] in she walks by inspiration she is not
[13:14] controlled by the emotion she's not
[13:17] looking at her all the emotions listen
[13:20] next time the lesson of the prize and
[13:24] the prize dates there's only ever one
[13:26] pride in every part of the way these
[13:30] days you might see - I was riding my
[13:35] bike along the bike path there the
[13:40] summer and like it was such a beautiful
[13:44] day was a gorgeous data and then all of
[13:46] a sudden I heard beautiful music my
[13:48] violins that sound so sweet it was so
[13:52] nice we were driving along and as we
[13:54] were coming along it was it was like a
[13:57] a couple of people there they were
[13:59] playing there you see nowadays due to
[14:39] see two brats it's going to become very
[14:41] common and it's edits and it's all
[14:45] because Satan is always mocking the Word
[14:48] of God that's a perversion of God's Word
[14:52] and then there's a big blood pride and
[14:55] there's only one group
[14:57] amen we got power they've just they
[15:01] mixed and matched it up and every kind
[15:04] of rich media you gotta tell you this
[15:06] neutral gender because didn't even know
[15:09] what they are anymore why because this
[15:12] is the hour that son and Laura
[15:17] right here on the earth before your very
[15:20] eyes don't get complacent and think that
[15:24] that's not yes it is normal in the world
[15:28] and it's not so I should have you should
[15:43] rejoice to know the word said as it was
[15:46] in the days of Sun so shall be when the
[15:49] Son of Man is betrayed and you've been
[15:52] blessed to hear the son of man to
[15:55] receive his word were similarities
[15:57] between the lives of his virgin they are
[16:01] were virgins indistinguishable from the
[16:05] outside all had their lamps at the ready
[16:09] so you know the scripture says they both
[16:12] had ups they both trim their legs
[16:16] these people what had the real oil that
[16:22] never runs drunk you see what you
[16:24] received as a son or daughter of God is
[16:28] not just like they said when I got
[16:32] converted I remember a lot of people
[16:36] said oh yeah Danny you know he's excited
[16:39] about something again because I'll
[16:44] design me that way
[16:46] McKenna yeah that's the way God designed
[16:48] me you know sometimes just my makeup
[16:57] it's the way God designed so when I got
[17:01] converted a lot of the bottle you just
[17:03] hop on another
[17:05] because I was into you know positive
[17:07] mental attitude I go to the seminars and
[17:11] I would get a lot you know I was
[17:13] constantly looking to improve you know
[17:16] self development you know like all the
[17:18] the teachings of the world and the New
[17:20] Age movement and everything else so that
[17:26] was just another movement you know just
[17:29] connected with something else and you
[17:32] know even myself
[17:34] you are just naturally got excited when
[17:36] something stirred me with something got
[17:39] a hold of me what I believed in
[17:41] something I believed in it I could sell
[17:43] it because you know that the true
[17:46] salesman they gotta believe in the
[17:47] product and somebody sees you and sees
[17:57] you as a Christian they know whether you
[17:59] believe it or not you're just trying to
[18:02] sell something because you've got an
[18:04] alter your motive
[18:08] you come in contact with the money
[18:14] there's a big difference so they thought
[18:16] oh he's just going home and then six
[18:18] months went by you received in the toil
[18:36] because listen you can see the
[18:44] supernatural to tell me after being
[18:52] delivered from a drug addiction that I
[18:56] hate that spirit out of control over my
[19:02] life back give it up but what I top
[19:05] delivered the day that I run into that
[19:06] got this little tank and came out of it
[19:09] I just knew that it would never be the
[19:12] same
[19:13] [Music]
[19:18] try to know because people asked me and
[19:21] I said you really want to know tell me
[19:24] what you know what really happen because
[19:26] the further on we go in we were
[19:28] neighbors and in a lot of you might know
[19:31] here on the Galapagos course you know
[19:32] they're they're huge
[19:33] there's well the the owner of Lagos you
[19:38] know the only surviving brother of all
[19:40] of them was a very very that he stood as
[19:42] a good friend and he came up to me and
[19:45] he Danny what happened
[19:46] he took this is what he said to me I
[19:53] said okay so I said I came in contact
[19:57] with the living not many
[20:00] I got supernaturally delivered from
[20:02] things in my life that has changed my
[20:05] life that is taking my life into a
[20:07] completely different direction I
[20:09] actually meant that's the way I
[20:13] expressed I said that's all I can tell
[20:15] you it's a reality and it bubbles and he
[20:20] never stops and he just keeps feeding me
[20:24] [Music]
[20:27] the desire to start to rise up
[20:29] he just raises the standard inside
[20:38] [Music]
[20:56] [Music]
[21:03] [Music]
[21:13] [Music]
[21:19] so you can never take that away from the
[21:24] Sun
[21:29] that the people that they're talking
[21:33] about in the word of God the one that
[21:35] word it just never goes track you know
[21:38] that you can never take away and you can
[21:42] always overcome because of that because
[21:47] [Music]
[21:54] place you into this ministry to fail I
[21:58] realize that was supernaturally placing
[22:02] and giving giving baby to over countless
[22:05] situations and to give you a destination
[22:09] and a home this way beyond hope it's a
[22:15] reality there's hopefully they can tell
[22:17] me that has any kind of
[22:24] [Music]
[22:34] [Music]
[22:44] [Music]
[23:02] [Music]
[23:13] is Gloria
[23:19] you know this one fear don't live here
[23:22] anymore when I say do we use is to try
[23:29] to bring you down you know what he uses
[23:31] to try to get you this fear evidence
[23:43] [Music]
[23:50] the only gear that you should have the
[23:52] fear of God
[24:02] [Music]
[24:13] you conference because God promised they
[24:22] are all profess to know Christ
[24:23] intimately as the silence you know you
[24:27] go there you know you can right here in
[24:30] the midst and in the ranks of this
[24:32] message
[24:32] you know the revelation is holding it's
[24:36] getting it's getting more and more
[24:38] personal as we would entitle the
[24:40] revelation of Jesus Christ and the
[24:43] rapture is not getting more of an
[24:47] international knowledge an international
[24:50] public show if that's what you're
[24:52] looking for you're gonna miss it it's
[24:54] becoming more and more personal to you
[24:57] as an individual it is God speaking to
[25:01] you personally
[25:03] giving you revelation of the fishes that
[25:06] are going on around you you just need to
[25:08] watch your mind
[25:09] watch your spirit get yourself settled
[25:13] down don't get so anxious and gets so
[25:16] excited you know just settle down to
[25:18] learn only spirit speak to you he'll
[25:21] give you the instruction and the
[25:24] leadership that you need and because why
[25:27] because you haven't interviewed walk
[25:28] with God that's what the pride has been
[25:31] to groom the bride's babies they sit
[25:34] back they look they wonder they see oh
[25:38] they're gonna be going on I wonder where
[25:41] they're going the bride knows where
[25:44] she's going
[25:45] the bride knows what pleases husband you
[25:49] see this is the hour that were limited
[25:51] and now these are the differences that
[25:54] separate us from the rest of the church
[25:58] Christian world so this is people go to
[26:08] church this you know people are filling
[26:11] the house of the Lord every Sunday
[26:13] they're all good to me to figure I'm
[26:15] going to meet with the bridegroom and
[26:17] then there's the few that the bridegroom
[26:20] is going to meet it's not so much that
[26:25] here gonna be him it's more in that he's
[26:29] gonna meet you
[26:31] Pixlr speak your name he's going to tell
[26:34] you about your situation he's going to
[26:37] get personal with you he's going to show
[26:40] you things that matter but come to pass
[26:43] in your life
[26:44] he's going to get more personal with you
[26:47] he's gonna give you more confidence you
[26:49] know what better way to start the day
[26:52] than to know that when you put your feet
[26:54] on the ground you've got a partner
[26:57] that's gonna walk with you who he's
[26:59] going to talk to you he's gonna
[27:01] destruction goddess goddess has given
[27:05] [Music]
[27:07] angels instruction to minister to you to
[27:12] provide for you because God could be
[27:17] here right now that can be right on the
[27:20] other side of the world right now
[27:21] ministering to this children because his
[27:25] ugly side he's he's eternal he can do
[27:28] all things he said we cannot living God
[27:30] in the way that we perceived him with
[27:33] our own understanding we have to see him
[27:35] in the way that he he he emanates
[27:38] himself through the Word of God he says
[27:40] all things not some things but all
[27:45] things so everybody goes up everybody
[27:50] goes you know to do to be with God but
[27:54] you know we're living in to the Lord
[27:55] because remember this careful it shows
[27:58] us from the beginning to the end what
[28:01] actually happens how the you know the
[28:04] the the bridegroom came and he shall be
[28:07] called and all of these things have
[28:10] given us so many things in the message
[28:13] and then the prophet of God all of the
[28:15] books above the shovel to the the Trump
[28:18] of God and we can look at all those
[28:20] different things but that's not my
[28:22] intention tonight my intention tonight
[28:24] is to get personal is to get personal
[28:27] with God to see where we couldn't you
[28:30] know fine-tune our own block where we
[28:32] can trim our lives because what happened
[28:35] is that after the project we would call
[28:37] came they all started to slumber and
[28:39] sleep because they heard he was going to
[28:41] come God said the Prophet said he's
[28:44] coming and when you listen to the proper
[28:46] to God and you hear him preach it and
[28:48] you think but I remember when I was back
[28:50] at the early you know the mid nineties
[28:52] when I was first listening to these
[28:53] messages and I thought then and the Holy
[28:56] Spirit under the building God Jesus
[28:58] could come tonight that's how real the
[29:02] word was and he'll be our
[29:05] twenty-some-odd you know it's twenty
[29:07] four and a half years later of still
[29:09] right here and I'm more excited about
[29:11] the Word of God a more excitable a
[29:13] toastie it hasn't gotten complacent oh
[29:17] yeah we can we can you know get like
[29:20] lazy in certain ways because you're
[29:22] dealing with this flesh and we can get
[29:25] to you know stages in our rocking
[29:27] together you haven't learned how to
[29:29] differentiate and not that the devil you
[29:31] know start playing with your mind okay
[29:34] you can't expect that you know that
[29:37] you're you're 55 or you're 65 and you're
[29:41] going to still be able to have you know
[29:43] the ability that God knew
[29:48] time's good luck if God gives you the
[29:52] energy to do that fart but don't let the
[29:55] devil you know put it in here right you
[29:58] know because there's stages in your life
[30:00] there's there's their seasons of your
[30:03] right where you do start to you know
[30:05] enjoy certain aspects of your life with
[30:09] your wife whether it be through
[30:11] vacations and time together and certain
[30:14] seasons and vacations and so forth right
[30:16] and not thinking that you just got to be
[30:19] constantly you know you got to
[30:22] constantly be working for God constantly
[30:24] up in train constantly reading the
[30:28] burdens of the viola that shouldn't
[30:30] actually be here desire regardless but
[30:33] you should be a free people Raymond you
[30:35] should not be under and customs of
[30:38] bondage and Latin you should not be
[30:41] about the law of this message oh yeah
[30:47] there's a listen this churches out there
[30:50] you might go one time you're on vacation
[30:51] and you go to a church people in there
[30:54] everything is just like so perfect and
[30:58] so every woman every person do you think
[31:01] oh my goodness is this like you know
[31:03] this this is like wow and then you go
[31:07] you had lunch and you sit down you start
[31:09] the fellowship and you realize the Holy
[31:15] Ghost is not there
[31:16] you can't figure it up like you know
[31:20] it's whatever it is I remember if I
[31:24] remember you know state like getting
[31:26] above any churches or anything else
[31:29] I'm not going to stapler to us or
[31:32] that's got nothing to do with me but I
[31:35] know what I've done went with the Spirit
[31:38] of God is it is it an individual there's
[31:42] a special kind of fellowship there
[31:44] there's a difference in the fellowship
[31:47] there's a there's the 19 there's a
[31:49] spirit there's something different
[31:53] because you think God is the author of
[31:55] confusion listen this is this is the
[31:58] season where we've gotta find two things
[32:01] we've got to see things as they should
[32:03] be
[32:04] god is love if God corrects you gives
[32:09] you a whipping
[32:10] you're still gonna feel the love if you
[32:14] don't feel the love of God that it
[32:16] wasn't the love of God it was an anger
[32:18] spirit it was some other kind of spirit
[32:21] that struck you that came against you
[32:25] whatever it was that counteracted you
[32:27] because God is perfect he is perfect on
[32:31] those hot breakfast children and deal
[32:33] with his children in such a way that you
[32:36] should not be after be corrected you
[32:38] should not be so depressed and soul so
[32:42] beaten up and lovely should be feeling
[32:44] the love of God and the Spirit of God
[32:47] here repenting and feeling
[32:49] those tears of joy coming on you yeah
[32:52] it's it's not tears of joy in such a way
[32:55] that you know that that can be sometimes
[32:57] experienced it's still different because
[33:00] God is correct you're beaten that dr.
[33:22] pepper it is that's this thing here that
[33:24] points up this thing is going to fight
[33:27] up you actually think that you're going
[33:31] to be perfect here on this earth to be
[33:54] in the body of Jesus Christ
[33:58] [Music]
[34:08] or whether it's race or emotion you had
[34:18] a winning attitude you've gotta be in a
[34:22] winning attitude this is the hour this
[34:24] is the body of Jesus Christ is a
[34:27] positive body your people you should be
[34:34] a positive person you just should be if
[34:40] you're not because you're feeding up too
[34:42] much negativity it's just that simple
[34:45] because you know this thing here
[34:47] whatever you feed it that's what's going
[34:50] to produce you've heard what you become
[34:53] what you eat well it's the truth and if
[34:56] you're feeding on negativity all you're
[34:59] speeding us now but there's something
[35:08] going up so sometimes you just kind of
[35:11] give up the right side of things you
[35:13] know and your attitude will determine
[35:16] your altitude I don't care what anybody
[35:19] says
[35:20] I've been an employer and I've hired
[35:22] hundreds of people over my ears and the
[35:27] negative people come to work for me see
[35:34] them okay there's there's no I'm not
[35:43] talking about negative there's there's
[35:46] there's constructive negative you know
[35:49] like if you've got a partner that sees
[35:51] things in a different way that's
[35:53] constructive because of their there
[35:56] they're the way that they perceive but
[35:58] when you because because you both
[36:00] understand each other you you create a
[36:03] positive result is you and me so there's
[36:07] there's a difference but if something's
[36:09] just
[36:09] all the time that I was fear I don't
[36:13] like why because the Spirit of God is
[36:16] not negative the Spirit of God is
[36:19] impossible we should be positive people
[36:23] the Bride of Christ
[36:25] she's a positive person she's a positive
[36:29] body people feel blessed when they're
[36:33] around positive people people like the
[36:36] energy of positive people it's just the
[36:40] plain fact they visit so what happens
[36:45] you go going back to our God there's a
[36:49] season now that's going on where it
[36:51] seems like wow you know you can get the
[36:54] skirt if you wonder where God is good
[36:56] why is this situation not changing it's
[36:59] a submarine time it's a time where you
[37:02] kind of almost fall asleep because not
[37:04] enough is going on around but you need
[37:08] to be aware the fact that the bridegroom
[37:12] is here he is here it's not a matter of
[37:17] that that he's coming he see people put
[37:20] him up into a into a future event we
[37:25] should do that that's what that's what's
[37:28] that's what delivered you from your
[37:30] situations was because he came it was in
[37:33] the press and he came to the moment of
[37:35] your need and he was present and it was
[37:38] thought that the liberty of that time
[37:39] and it's bad
[37:42] you should get sleepy we shouldn't get
[37:45] the skirt and civil awareness to cover
[37:48] the floor we all experience it we all
[37:55] get discouraged but we need to
[37:58] understand the season the rhythm the
[38:00] time and what what we can actually
[38:03] experience in those seasons and not get
[38:07] so discouraged but understand of the
[38:09] season you don't wanna get to the point
[38:12] where you just fall asleep and you're
[38:14] not useful anymore in the body of Christ
[38:18] there's a lot of people that's what's
[38:20] happening they're actually slumbering
[38:23] they're not taking their positions
[38:26] seriously and it affects the body it has
[38:30] an effect upon the ministry amen
[38:34] we don't want to be going to sleep but
[38:37] that's like the difference between the
[38:41] wise and the foolish virgins his son
[38:49] picked up this know you should be doing
[39:18] it says suffer done the others have only
[39:22] a form of godliness now put on the
[39:27] dummies that's not going to work you
[39:30] cannot pull down you can't pulled up so
[39:35] don't employ honor
[39:37] you gotta get serious with your watch
[39:40] you gotta get to a place where you just
[39:42] want because you need it before God let
[39:45] deal with your situations let's scatter
[39:50] out the unbelief to your right because
[39:52] that's all it is it's just ugly
[39:55] it's just stubbornness is just things
[39:57] that you would want to make go up
[39:59] because this thing here is gonna fight
[40:01] you
[40:02] it's going to decide are the things of
[40:04] this world it's gonna possibly love know
[40:06] I deserve this I'm deserve that we all
[40:12] deserve hell that's what we deserve it's
[40:20] a little place where you realize you
[40:22] gotta surrender certain things you gotta
[40:24] let go certain things you got like you
[40:27] know some have Christ in their heart
[40:30] some have made the commitment only that
[40:33] just you know taking on a because you
[40:39] think you think you can't do it some you
[40:46] know they they they make it a social
[40:48] thing this is not about a social
[40:51] ministry Facebook and all these things
[40:56] and you know they do all these these
[40:58] different social medias and stuff like
[41:00] that that's all training the people do
[41:03] you know what that's training the people
[41:04] to do not bring them together actually
[41:08] separate because people don't get
[41:11] together people just tax fine
[41:20] [Music]
[41:32] [Music]
[41:40] [Music]
[41:57] because because here you're being molded
[42:00] by society you're not by society you're
[42:04] not to be controlled we use these tools
[42:09] we use one purpose and that is to serve
[42:14] because you're right you can have you
[42:18] can have peace you can have rest you can
[42:20] have vacations you can lots of nice
[42:23] dinners up you can do all those things
[42:25] and still serve God you can because you
[42:31] are free as people under but we've got
[42:34] to get things prioritizing our lives
[42:40] only those likes only those who are
[42:44] ready and truly know Christ will be
[42:46] admitted into the kingdom these are
[42:48] things have that depth that we see from
[42:51] this parent because Christ was before
[42:54] the time came he just didn't let anybody
[42:57] in look at the ones that came knocking
[43:00] on the door he said absolutely
[43:13] [Music]
[43:32] [Music]
[43:40] [Music]
[43:43] which is an attribute of always because
[44:02] to be a convenient remember and in order
[44:05] to be DC something it has to be lost and
[44:08] it's gotta be lost somewhere
[44:11] it's got to be this equipped with a
[44:12] watch when you take the watch when
[44:14] something steals your watch it takes it
[44:16] to the pawn shop your watches is enough
[44:19] is enough a cabinet with another
[44:21] thousand other launches over stolen will
[44:31] new every single one of them he had the
[44:35] place of my most creative beings beings
[44:41] that would be used for his purpose they
[44:44] would have to be given and they would
[44:46] have met and so the foolish virgins she
[44:49] falls under this category that she boss
[44:53] to the wedding but she doesn't
[44:56] Rose chain she witnesses and hears about
[45:01] all the things that he's going to do but
[45:03] he will be reduced it turned her and
[45:05] that is the difference is that he knew
[45:09] you from before the foundations of the
[45:12] world he pleased himself a portion of
[45:15] himself in you and when the time came
[45:18] that he wanted to manifest his word in
[45:21] the season of this 21st century and he
[45:25] needed you to be positioned into the
[45:28] body of Christ into a certain church
[45:30] under a certain pastor not on your son
[45:34] take ministry not herself General
[45:38] Assembly all things differentiating the
[45:43] foolish in the wife virgin a wise virgin
[45:47] my wife she's not going to Kobe you know
[45:50] anything this husband one time to the
[45:53] Bluebird
[46:03] [Music]
[46:12] [Music]
[46:17] [Music]
[46:31] [Music]
[46:43] and that rises up for you you better
[46:46] watch it I'm telling you right now it'll
[46:51] it'll suck you right to a little an
[46:55] ugly and you'll wish no puffy because
[46:57] Shannon will always get further than you
[47:01] ever wonderful it's just the witness god
[47:05] pull this out if you are you a couple of
[47:10] place where you realize your past you
[47:12] realize your position
[47:14] mr. you realized the part of the body
[47:16] and then where God has placed you and
[47:18] then you give yourself you surrender you
[47:21] attended church on a regular basis you
[47:23] felt that to assemble yourself you feel
[47:27] that because of some excuse
[47:29] yes some kind of works
