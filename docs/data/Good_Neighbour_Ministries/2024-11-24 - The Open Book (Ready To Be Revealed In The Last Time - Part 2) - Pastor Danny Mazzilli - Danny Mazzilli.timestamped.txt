[35:13] let's go to the word of God this morning
[35:16] amen we're going to continue um where we
[35:20] left off last
[35:21] week and um this morning we're looking
[35:24] at the open book praise God we we want
[35:27] to we want to uh see how this book is
[35:32] unveiling itself in this day and how the
[35:35] you know the the the Bible is the book
[35:37] but yet the Bible is hidden from from
[35:40] everybody that doesn't have the spirit
[35:43] of of Revelation upon them that's why
[35:46] this book is just a book it's just a
[35:48] Bible there's many people that are
[35:50] reading from it and there's so many
[35:51] different interpretations that are being
[35:54] uh brought out because of man's
[35:56] traditions man's ways man's
[35:59] understanding of how to interpret the
[36:01] word of God but we're not to interpret
[36:03] the word of God we are not to lean upon
[36:06] our own understanding we are to allow
[36:08] the Holy Spirit to come through the
[36:10] foolishness of preaching to minister the
[36:14] word and to unveil himself amen it's not
[36:17] about a minister coming here to unveil
[36:20] what he
[36:21] knows he doesn't know anything if he's
[36:24] truly called of God he's come into the
[36:27] into knowing him amen and that and that
[36:30] like brother brandom said listen I may
[36:32] not know all the science and all the
[36:35] understanding and all the way things
[36:36] work but you know but I do know the
[36:38] author of Life the author of life and
[36:42] that's what we are feasting on Amen
[36:44] praise God so let's read our first
[36:46] scripture this morning um Ephesians chap
[36:50] 1: 9- 11 having made known unto us the
[36:54] mystery of his will according to his
[36:58] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[37:01] himself so here we see clearly that
[37:04] there's a plan that he has within
[37:07] himself which he has purposed within
[37:10] himself but he has chosen you to be
[37:14] partakers of the mystery of his will he
[37:18] hasn't chosen everybody you who he has
[37:22] uh identified here will know who you are
[37:25] because you will be able to identify
[37:27] with the word amen that in the
[37:30] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[37:33] might gather together in one all things
[37:37] in
[37:38] Christ we're not Gathering all into one
[37:40] church building or all into one
[37:42] denomination or into one you know uh uh
[37:46] part of the
[37:47] world it's in Christ it's a supernatural
[37:52] mystical body it's the church that's
[37:55] being prepared in these last days to
[37:59] receive rapturing faith for a body
[38:02] change for the Rapture amen and he's got
[38:06] to bring us together in
[38:08] one all things in Christ both which are
[38:12] in heaven and which are on earth and
[38:16] even in him so he's going to pull every
[38:20] single attribute every single one that
[38:23] he knew from before the foundations of
[38:25] the world whether they've gone beyond
[38:27] this Dimension they've lived their lives
[38:29] through the other Church ages they gave
[38:32] their lives for this gospel but they
[38:34] were identified attributes of God
[38:37] because God lived through them
[38:39] manifested through them fulfilled his
[38:42] word through them that's why Luther
[38:45] could break away from the Catholic
[38:47] church and say the just shall live by
[38:49] faith he received Revelation that I need
[38:52] a personal walk with God I need to know
[38:55] him personal amen and that's that's what
[38:57] he's doing in this day still the same in
[39:00] whom also we have obtained an
[39:03] inheritance glory to God being
[39:07] predestinated according to the purpose
[39:09] of him who worketh all things after the
[39:12] councel of his own will this is all
[39:16] about his last Testament
[39:20] will Hallelujah are you going to hear
[39:23] your name this morning have you heard
[39:25] your name being called to The
[39:26] Inheritance
[39:27] God bless you may be
[39:29] seated Hallelujah glory to God let's
[39:33] read the next slide brother Bram
[39:34] speaking here now God's great mystery
[39:37] from Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[39:40] on how it's a
[39:42] secret he's kept it a secret nobody know
[39:46] nothing about it even the angels didn't
[39:50] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[39:53] that's the reason under our seventh
[39:56] mystery when that seventh seal was open
[40:00] there was silence Hallelujah Jesus when
[40:03] he was on Earth they wanted to know when
[40:06] he would come he said it's not even the
[40:08] son
[40:09] himself don't even
[40:12] know when it's going to happen see God
[40:15] has this all to himself it's a secret
[40:19] and that's the reason there was silence
[40:22] in heaven for a space of a half hour it
[40:25] was around 28 minutes that uh the the
[40:28] the great Cloud showed up in 1963 just
[40:32] about a half an hour it showed itself
[40:34] amen praise God hallelujah amen 28 miles
[40:38] high there was there you know people
[40:41] will not realize what has already taken
[40:44] place in this day and in this hour this
[40:47] mystery that we're talking about that
[40:50] God is unveiling through his word his
[40:53] his will his purpose his plan is not
[40:56] something that is
[40:57] into the distant future a lot of people
[41:00] are always putting his word into the
[41:02] distant future he's going to do this
[41:04] he's going to do that and they feel to
[41:06] recognize what he's doing
[41:09] now and what he's already
[41:12] done even the son of man don't know when
[41:16] it's going to happen see God has this
[41:19] all to himself it's a secret and that's
[41:21] the reason there was a there was silence
[41:23] in heaven for the space of a half hour
[41:26] and seven thund ERS uttered their voices
[41:30] and John was forbidden to write
[41:33] it see the coming of the Lord what was
[41:37] the seventh seal what was the opening of
[41:41] those Seven Seals what was it when when
[41:44] that seventh seal was open and there was
[41:46] silence in heaven it was the coming of
[41:50] the Lord back to the Earth that's what
[41:54] the opening of the seventh seal
[41:56] represented amen you you see it here it
[42:00] was it it was the coming of the Lord
[42:03] that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[42:07] of how he will come and when he will
[42:10] come it's a good thing that he doesn't
[42:13] no he has showed or revealed it in every
[42:17] type that's in the Bible so remember
[42:21] last week when we were reading and
[42:23] talking about if you don't see Jesus
[42:25] Christ from Genesis to Revelation you've
[42:28] missed Christ you if you don't see
[42:31] Christ in every scripture in every life
[42:34] that was lived in every one that was
[42:37] manifesting the spirit of God and the
[42:40] will of God and the ones that would say
[42:41] thus sayeth the
[42:43] Lord hear ye the word of the Lord that
[42:46] was Christ that was Christ condescending
[42:51] coming down moving through the Old
[42:54] Testament IM morphan himself we're going
[42:57] to be looking at that this morning
[42:59] because the book's been open amen
[43:02] everything's been revealed a lot of
[43:04] people don't realize what's been
[43:06] revealed and they they they sit in this
[43:09] this um almost unconscious realization
[43:13] of what is actually going on they sit in
[43:16] the message they believe the message I
[43:18] go to a message church I identify with a
[43:21] you listen that doesn't make you a part
[43:24] of the body of Jesus Christ there are
[43:27] things that will happen within message
[43:30] churches that will shock you and you'll
[43:33] wonder well wait a minute how can this
[43:35] possibly happen in in a church that
[43:38] believes William brandom as their
[43:40] prophet and believes that that that the
[43:42] Seven Seals were open and that the the
[43:44] Mighty God has come down and and yet
[43:47] there's this unbelief there's this in uh
[43:51] this this stubborn uh spirit that's not
[43:54] willing to go beyond the boundaries of
[43:57] you listen only to the tapes you you you
[44:00] if you don't listen to the tapes and and
[44:02] you don't say exactly what William
[44:04] brandham said you're
[44:06] lost they're putting Christ out of the
[44:09] church again and they don't know
[44:11] it we can't do
[44:13] that you're going to come to see as we
[44:16] come you know I don't know how far we're
[44:17] going to get today you pray you believe
[44:20] God will speak to you whatever situation
[44:22] where you're at whatever circumstance
[44:24] whatever uh God is dealing with you he's
[44:28] he's moving you along okay he's pressing
[44:31] us all along he's progressing his word
[44:34] within each and every one of us we need
[44:36] to see where God has you know where God
[44:39] has us today so that we can see where
[44:41] we're going amen praise God and so go to
[44:44] the next slide let's continue in the
[44:46] same uh quote he says therefore the
[44:49] entire Bible is the revelation of God's
[44:54] mystery in Christ
[44:57] the entire
[44:58] Bible That's why brother Braham says
[45:01] when he came to start this message on
[45:02] Christ The Mystery of God revealed he
[45:04] says I'm going to take the T I'm going
[45:07] to take the title Christ The Mystery of
[45:10] God revealed but it is going to
[45:13] Encompass the entire
[45:17] Bible because Christ The Mystery of God
[45:23] is going to be revealed and it's being
[45:26] revealed he from the start Genesis all
[45:29] the way to Revelation amen the entire
[45:33] Bible is an expression of one goal that
[45:36] God had one
[45:39] purpose how many purposes one one one
[45:43] purpose because that one purpose we're
[45:45] going to come to see that oh my goodness
[45:49] are you kidding me you mean that's what
[45:51] it was all yeah that's you're going to
[45:52] see he wanted to achieve in the entire
[45:56] Bible and all the acts of the Believers
[46:00] in the Bible has been a type and
[46:03] expressing what God's Great goal is and
[46:07] now in this last day brother brandham
[46:11] was saying that back in 1963 I'm telling
[46:13] you in
[46:15] 2024 in this last
[46:18] day Hallelujah glory to God Amen he has
[46:23] revealed it and shows it
[46:27] and God's help we'll see it right here
[46:30] this morning what the Lord has had in
[46:33] his mind all along and has expressed it
[46:38] glory to God Saints I'm telling you this
[46:41] is glorious this this word will never
[46:45] stop unveiling itself people don't
[46:47] realize they get behind the pulpit and
[46:49] they just want to quote quote quote
[46:51] quote but they don't want to allow the
[46:53] the mind of God to come into the midst
[46:55] of the preaching of the word word to
[46:57] speak lip to ear to to Sons and
[47:00] Daughters of God to awaken them out of
[47:02] their their their Amnesia that that that
[47:05] they find themselves in they get more
[47:07] confused by listening to some preachers
[47:10] than they do anything else especially if
[47:13] you are an attribute of God you can only
[47:17] respond to the Deep call that's why when
[47:20] when people were talking to you about
[47:21] the word of God you were wondering ah I
[47:25] don't know you know well you got to come
[47:26] to the Baptist Church you got to come to
[47:28] the Pentecostal Church boy in the
[47:30] Pentecostal Church they'll get you
[47:31] speaking in tongues and if they can get
[47:34] you speaking in tongues you got the Holy
[47:36] Ghost you're going to be saved you can
[47:39] go back and live any way you want you're
[47:41] going to be saved they don't realize
[47:44] that when you receive the Holy Ghost
[47:45] it's God in you amen it's God in you and
[47:49] and let me tell you when Jesus Christ
[47:51] came to the Earth there was a
[47:52] disturbance there wasn't a great
[47:54] following oh praise God there he is is
[47:57] the Messiah hallelujah praise God no sir
[48:00] they said this guy's causing trouble and
[48:03] when you get filled with the Holy Ghost
[48:05] and the word of God starts to live
[48:06] through you and starts to point back to
[48:08] the word and starts to identify baptism
[48:11] in jesus' name God had no such thing as
[48:15] a trinity God from before the
[48:17] foundations of the world what took place
[48:19] in the Garden of Eden the serpent seed
[48:22] the opening of the word all these things
[48:24] people start saying this is mumble
[48:26] jumble this person speaking in tongues
[48:28] that's the real
[48:30] tongues that's the real not not this
[48:33] mumble jumble where there's no
[48:35] interpretation Paul said listen if
[48:37] there's no interpretation quiet amen you
[48:41] come subject to the spirit of the Lord
[48:43] let the Holy Spirit speak to your needs
[48:45] and to the situations and let him tell
[48:48] you what his will is his purpose his
[48:51] plan not your will not my
[48:53] will even Jesus himself had to come
[48:56] subject to the will of God at the Garden
[48:58] of Gethsemane and he had to separate
[49:02] from that vessel and be so that he could
[49:04] be all man going to the Cross there had
[49:08] to be a sinless spotless sacrifice and
[49:11] it had to be in the form of a
[49:14] man we're going to look deeper into that
[49:17] there's so much in there glory to God
[49:20] Amen the time of your
[49:23] word is now coming into manifestation am
[49:28] Jesus was the word for his day William
[49:31] brandom was the word for his day this
[49:34] bride there's a church there are
[49:36] individuals a many membered body that
[49:38] has a word for her day and we need to
[49:42] come into that aspect because it's there
[49:45] that we receive rapturing Faith it's
[49:48] there that we get perfect Faith to know
[49:50] who we are it's there that we recognize
[49:52] what to do with the word a minister that
[49:55] gets up here doesn't really know who he
[49:58] is and all he's doing he's quote and
[49:59] quotes reading scriptures without an
[50:03] understanding that the mighty Angel
[50:04] himself is in the midst speaking to
[50:06] hearts and lives calling some out
[50:09] calling some Eagles and calling some
[50:14] buzzards because this word is going to
[50:17] separate it's the hour of manifestation
[50:20] that's why do not be surprised when you
[50:23] hear things within the boundaries of
[50:26] this
[50:27] message you hear things and you oh my
[50:30] God is that possible of course it's
[50:33] possible the rain falls on the just and
[50:35] the unjust the pale horse rider is
[50:38] riding right into the message of the
[50:39] hour how could it be so deceiving that
[50:42] it would deceive the very elect think
[50:45] about that how could it be so deceiving
[50:48] that it would deceive even the very
[50:49] elect if it was possible unless it was
[50:52] really
[50:54] deceiving really deceiving yes and the
[50:57] only way it's going to be really
[50:58] deceiving is going to be a brother or
[51:01] sister that could be sitting right next
[51:02] to you claiming oh hallelujah praise God
[51:07] and yet what comes out of their mouth is
[51:10] not
[51:11] Revelation it's not Revelation it's
[51:14] confusion they don't realize what
[51:16] they're
[51:17] speaking they oh yeah God sent a prophet
[51:20] yeah yeah yeah yeah God sent a
[51:22] prophet well what about God sending the
[51:24] Holy Ghost in This Day and in this hour
[51:27] what about the word for your day because
[51:30] in the beginning was the word and the
[51:31] Word was with God and the Word was God
[51:34] and when you receive the word in your
[51:36] day that's God that's God speaking to
[51:39] you and you turn around and say no I
[51:41] don't need that you better surrender you
[51:44] better check yourself you better not be
[51:47] looking to man you better be looking to
[51:50] the holy spirit amen let's go on here
[51:53] listen go to the next scripture in
[51:55] Psalms 105 I'm going use this as an
[51:58] example talking about David here he says
[52:00] moreover he called for a famine he's
[52:03] talking about the Lord upon the land he
[52:05] break the whole staff of bread he sent a
[52:08] man before them even Joseph who was sold
[52:12] for a servant whose feet they hurt with
[52:14] feathers he was laid in Iron until now
[52:18] listen careful here until the time that
[52:21] his word came now you could read that in
[52:24] a couple ways and you'd both and they
[52:27] both be right because there's a time for
[52:30] Joseph's word your word and his word and
[52:33] when his word and your word identify and
[52:36] they match up a deep call to the Deep
[52:39] it's the word amen it's the word
[52:41] manifest in your day it's the word
[52:43] manifesting in this hour showing God is
[52:47] now going to do something and look what
[52:49] he did he says until the time that his
[52:51] word came the word of the Lord Tried Him
[52:55] you've been wondering why you've been
[52:56] going through all the battles oh I've
[52:58] been in the message for 30 years and oh
[53:00] my God I'm going through the worst
[53:02] Battle of my life
[53:03] yeah yeah because you're still in that
[53:07] flesh you're still weak in human flesh
[53:11] and until you get to a place where you
[53:13] realize this thing is your
[53:16] enemy you will you will fall under
[53:20] subjection to the Flesh and you will
[53:22] allow that to
[53:24] manifest where God wants to manifest his
[53:26] word he's trying you he's testing you
[53:30] he's trying to see how much of you is
[53:33] willing to
[53:34] die because until you completely die
[53:39] completely die I know nothing I I I just
[53:42] want to be you know I just listen when
[53:45] when when when the sons of God when you
[53:47] go back and and recognize when when even
[53:50] when doubting Thomas here Jesus comes
[53:53] into the room and and and and he's
[53:56] making himself known as the word now in
[53:59] the resurrect he's been resurrected he's
[54:01] in his theophany and he's he's unveiling
[54:03] himself to the to the other Apostles and
[54:05] Thomas says no I don't believe it I
[54:08] don't believe it but the moment that
[54:11] Jesus said
[54:13] Thomas something quickened within him he
[54:17] says don't you see my my my my my uh
[54:20] handprints you know he says come here
[54:22] you want it doesn't say that he actually
[54:24] went and didn't no it says that he felt
[54:26] prostate and he worshiped the Lord he
[54:29] says oh Jesus Hallelujah he recognized
[54:32] because God called his name God woke him
[54:35] up to realize who he actually was and
[54:39] until that time that season comes into
[54:41] your life you won't know even Mary Mary
[54:44] goes to the Grave after the
[54:46] resurrection she goes there and somebody
[54:49] uh have you seen
[54:51] him have you seen him since he has
[54:54] risen meanwhile it was him self and the
[54:58] moment that he said Mary she went
[55:02] R but but until then she was blinded she
[55:05] didn't recognize you see there's a time
[55:06] and a season for every one of us amen
[55:09] the word is going to come to you at his
[55:11] appointed time and it's not going to be
[55:13] an open display that's what the seventh
[55:16] seal is all about it's all about him
[55:18] coming to you coming to you in your
[55:21] placing in your part of the word so you
[55:23] can awaken to the recognition of what
[55:25] God is doing now in you as a part of the
[55:30] local Body of Christ because he has a
[55:33] purpose for you being here amen glory to
[55:36] God hallelujah and so look he goes on he

[57:56] God don't want that God wants to be able
[58:00] to seek character and wisdom and
[58:02] direction in that life to where it's
[58:04] yielded and so surrendered that if he

[58:09] word we say nothing we allow the Holy
[58:12] Spirit to speak when he needs to speak

[58:39] you prosper in your
[58:41] financial Adventures why you prosper in
[58:45] your in your health why you prosper in
[58:48] your relationships because you have
[58:51] allowed the spirit and the character of
[58:53] Christ to have the preeminence over you
[58:57] to control you to give you understanding
[59:01] and to show that by Revelation you
[59:03] understand what it means to
[59:06] give you understand that it's Jehovah
[59:09] Gyra that gives you your
[59:11] job until you get to a place to
[59:15] understand that it's Jehovah Gyra that
[59:16] gives you your
[59:18] job you're going to be looking for jobs
[59:21] that fit you oh no I don't want that job
[59:25] come on now oh no I'm too good for that
[59:28] I'll wait for this but meanwhile God
[59:31] wants you there for a purpose so that he
[59:34] can get you there with the wisdom but a
[59:37] lot of people want to go there with no
[59:39] wisdom and before you know it they're
[59:40] out the door because they are not
[59:43] allowing the spirit of Jehovah Gyra to
[59:46] control their lives they receive money
[59:51] however they get it wherever it comes
[59:53] from an attribute Son of God will know
[59:56] that that finance that money came from
[1:00:00] him because they've made him
[1:00:03] Lord don't tell me you've made Jesus
[1:00:06] Christ Lord and somebody says you should
[1:00:08] be paying your tithes and you and you
[1:00:10] Rebel you have not made Jesus Christ
[1:00:13] Lord you don't trust him as Jehovah Gyra
[1:00:17] you don't believe that he's going to
[1:00:18] provide all your needs you don't believe
[1:00:20] the word that says try me and see if I
[1:00:22] don't open the windows of heaven and
[1:00:25] pour out a blessing on you that you
[1:00:26] won't even be able to contain because
[1:00:29] you gave by
[1:00:32] Revelation Oh Glory to God let me tell
[1:00:34] you we want to walk with God don't we if
[1:00:37] you want to walk with God and you want
[1:00:38] to experience the the the great things
[1:00:41] you got to do the small things you got
[1:00:43] to you got to come back to your ABCs and
[1:00:46] and know that you're really believing
[1:00:48] what you confess to actually believe
[1:00:52] glory to God Amen Hallelujah so God will
[1:00:56] do all of these things he'll make you
[1:00:58] ruler over your house he's conveying his
[1:01:01] word unveiling the mystery in you you
[1:01:04] see you're a part of the mystery
[1:01:06] although Christ is the mystery but
[1:01:08] you're in Christ so a part of you has
[1:01:09] got to be unveiled a part of you has got
[1:01:12] to be uh you know uh sealed and and got
[1:01:15] to be
[1:01:16] unsealed because we tend to come into
[1:01:18] the house of the Lord and we've become a
[1:01:20] part of the body and we don't want to
[1:01:22] allow God to go in and unseal Our Lives
[1:01:25] because there's things in there that you
[1:01:27] got to get rid of there's circumstances
[1:01:30] that are sealed under that first seal or
[1:01:32] that second seal or that third seal you
[1:01:34] go back you'll see what they all
[1:01:36] represent you know they all repres one
[1:01:38] represented War because you know in in
[1:01:41] in some of you there's an attitude of
[1:01:43] war and that Seal's got to be broken off
[1:01:46] your life and you that Spirit of
[1:01:49] rebellion that constantly has to have
[1:01:51] the last word has to say no this is the
[1:01:53] way it is instead of surrendering to the
[1:01:56] Holy Spirit allowing the spirit of God
[1:01:58] to unveil you remove these things
[1:02:01] because when he does that you know what
[1:02:03] it's going to show
[1:02:05] Christ it's going to show him and
[1:02:08] somebody's going to see and
[1:02:11] say I can say that this person has been
[1:02:13] with Jesus I know that this person has
[1:02:16] been with Jesus I can see the the the
[1:02:19] the the compassion in them I can see
[1:02:22] them they can they can cut but they
[1:02:26] immediately know how to mend in the
[1:02:28] right way you see God has placed his his
[1:02:31] servants in such a way that they will
[1:02:34] not hinder bruise it will not it will
[1:02:38] not uh um you know hinder it will not
[1:02:40] muzzle the oxx amen that's threshing out
[1:02:43] the corn if you're somebody that's
[1:02:45] that's supporting the ministry and that
[1:02:47] you're doing it and you and you know and
[1:02:49] sometimes it's a little more difficult
[1:02:51] to make that tithe payment but yet you
[1:02:53] go beyond that and you and you and you
[1:02:56] do it God just pours out blessing upon
[1:02:59] you it you know it's never easy nothing
[1:03:01] is easy when it comes to serving the
[1:03:04] lord Satan's going to do everything in
[1:03:06] his power to stop
[1:03:08] you he's going to throw
[1:03:11] a an automobile build right into your
[1:03:14] face your transmission's gone
[1:03:18] H Hallelujah that that that shouldn't
[1:03:21] stop you from coming to church if your
[1:03:24] transmission's G then you just take a
[1:03:29] uber prise God because you're going to
[1:03:32] hear what you're going to hear something
[1:03:33] from the Lord that's going to tell you
[1:03:34] exactly why he's going to take care of
[1:03:37] that transmission repair and how he's
[1:03:39] going to take care of it I don't care
[1:03:41] how he's going to take care of it I
[1:03:43] don't need to know how he's going to
[1:03:44] take care of it I just believe it and I
[1:03:47] believe I need to be in the house of the
[1:03:48] Lord so I'm going to go there and he's
[1:03:50] going to speak to me he's going to meet
[1:03:52] my needs because I believe the word
[1:03:55] amen let's go to the next scripture 2
[1:03:58] Thessalonians because you got to realize
[1:04:00] here that when you come to a place where
[1:04:03] you believe that word you become a
[1:04:05] carrier of that word you become the word
[1:04:08] in your day all of a sudden now what you
[1:04:11] say and what you live and what you
[1:04:14] manifest around the other people can
[1:04:16] draw in that last one can can bring
[1:04:20] others to Christ can bring them out of
[1:04:22] their bondage can bring them out of
[1:04:23] their situations whatever ever they
[1:04:26] might
[1:04:27] be Thessalonians
[1:04:31] 17-10 and to you who are troubled rest
[1:04:34] with us when the Lord Jesus shall be
[1:04:37] revealed from heaven with his mighty
[1:04:39] Angels did we not say in 1963 the mighty
[1:04:42] Angel Christ himself himself that that
[1:04:45] cloud was was the white wigged Jesus
[1:04:48] Christ the one that was from the
[1:04:50] beginning the Elohim the the
[1:04:52] self-existent one but he was imorph in
[1:04:54] himself coming into man form again amen
[1:04:58] praise God and here he was he revealed
[1:05:01] us inflaming fire taking Vengeance now
[1:05:04] listen those that are going to say ah it
[1:05:06] was just jet
[1:05:09] fuel I don't believe
[1:05:12] it God what Jesus come already yes he's
[1:05:15] come already he's here right now he's
[1:05:18] opened his word the book has been opened
[1:05:21] a lot of people are reading from a
[1:05:22] closed book even though it's open they
[1:05:24] don't understand that that book is
[1:05:25] sealed to them unless God opens it to
[1:05:28] them it wasn't until listen on the road
[1:05:30] to EMAs Jesus was walking with them
[1:05:32] talking about
[1:05:34] himself a lot of people are out there
[1:05:36] priest talking about Jesus talking about
[1:05:38] the
[1:05:39] Lord but it wasn't until Jesus
[1:05:43] himself broke the bread and their eyes
[1:05:47] were open it's it's still going to take
[1:05:50] Christ to come to you personal right now
[1:05:54] you young people you're hearing brother
[1:05:55] brother Danny you're saying oh my
[1:05:57] goodness these quotes and the word and
[1:05:59] this is just just sit there don't worry
[1:06:02] let the Holy Spirit speak to you at some
[1:06:06] appointed time he's going to break the
[1:06:08] bread of life he's going to break the
[1:06:10] seal upon your life and all of a sudden
[1:06:13] it's going to make sense you're going to
[1:06:14] say holy Hallelujah I I got to get to
[1:06:17] the baptismal tank glory to God I got to
[1:06:20] get rid of this old life that's on me
[1:06:21] this old life that's been uh it's
[1:06:24] weighing me down you know I I here I you
[1:06:27] mean I've been around the message for
[1:06:29] that long I've been so rebellious I
[1:06:31] didn't want to I'm not getting baptized
[1:06:33] I'm not going to be one of those freaks
[1:06:35] go to get baptized and show myself in
[1:06:37] front of the people no if you've got
[1:06:39] that kind of attitude stay as far away
[1:06:41] from that tank as you can
[1:06:42] stay because going to take the Holy
[1:06:44] Ghost when it comes upon you and it
[1:06:47] strikes your heart and God opens your
[1:06:49] life opens your seal unveils who you
[1:06:52] really are that you're not just the son
[1:06:54] of so and so that you you weren't just
[1:06:55] born into this world to just live so
[1:06:58] many years and die but you were born to
[1:07:00] be a manifested son or daughter of the
[1:07:03] Living God
[1:07:05] hallelujah amen glory to God so here he
[1:07:08] goes on he says now in flaming fire
[1:07:10] taking Vengeance on them that know God
[1:07:13] that know not
[1:07:15] God and that obey not the gospel of our
[1:07:19] Lord Jesus Christ I'm telling you
[1:07:21] there's no other gospel out there that's
[1:07:23] going to bring Salvation that's going to
[1:07:25] bring a body change that's going to take
[1:07:27] them out of the Great Tribulation but
[1:07:30] the Gospel of Jesus
[1:07:32] Christ I'm making that declaration in
[1:07:35] the name of the Lord and there's no
[1:07:38] other gospel but the Gospel of Jesus
[1:07:40] Christ you want salvation you need to
[1:07:43] come and and and identify yourself with
[1:07:46] Jesus Christ and if you identify
[1:07:48] yourself as with Jesus Christ he will
[1:07:51] look at you and he will say I knew you
[1:07:55] you when you were under the tree like he
[1:07:58] said to Nathaniel And you you know me I
[1:08:03] remember when he when he did that for me
[1:08:05] and I said me you mean you mean you know
[1:08:08] me he says before you were even born I
[1:08:12] knew
[1:08:13] you he says remember this you remember
[1:08:16] that remember this situation remember
[1:08:19] that situation how do you think you got
[1:08:21] out of that situation why do you think I
[1:08:24] kept you from from this and kept you
[1:08:26] listen you go look back on your own
[1:08:28] lives amen I can only look back on my
[1:08:30] life and I can only see that he was
[1:08:32] there he was protecting not Danny
[1:08:36] misilli he was protecting the word that
[1:08:38] was placed in Danny missil because he
[1:08:41] knew at some point in time that word
[1:08:44] would have to
[1:08:45] manifest and it was not just some small
[1:08:49] part of the word listen don't think that
[1:08:50] you because you're sitting in the pews
[1:08:52] and you're saying amen and you might be
[1:08:54] the door cleaner cleaner or the mat
[1:08:56] keeper or the washroom cleaner that you
[1:08:58] are not just as important to the word
[1:09:01] and to the body and to the will and to
[1:09:03] the purpose of God as a
[1:09:07] minister because when it all comes down
[1:09:09] to it it's Christ the
[1:09:12] mystery not you the mystery you as being
[1:09:16] a part of the mystery but it's Christ
[1:09:20] that's being revealed Hallelujah and he
[1:09:23] goes on he says and these people that
[1:09:24] disb believe the word that are going to
[1:09:26] reject it in you and and when they hear
[1:09:29] it their punishment for rejecting Christ
[1:09:33] just like you go back into the Old
[1:09:35] Testament when the when the spirit of
[1:09:37] God came on Jeremiah and went to those
[1:09:40] kings they were
[1:09:42] Kings and said thus sayeth the Lord jeim
[1:09:47] son of uh you know so King King uh so
[1:09:51] and so if you do not turn away from your
[1:09:54] evil ways God is going to destroy this
[1:09:57] city God is going to wipe out you guys
[1:10:00] are going to be hit with pestilence
[1:10:01] you're going to be hit with all kinds of
[1:10:04] disease well the world is entering into
[1:10:07] listen we've already experienced it I
[1:10:09] don't know about you but there's
[1:10:11] pestilence on the earth there's disease
[1:10:13] on the earth you want to thank God for
[1:10:16] the hedge of the holy spirit in your
[1:10:17] life Hallelujah that you can be sealed
[1:10:21] until the day of your Redemption and
[1:10:23] that God keeps you God provides for you
[1:10:26] listen but the world is still going on

[1:10:40] background people don't realize these
[1:10:42] are the
[1:10:44] seeds for
[1:10:46] nuclear
[1:10:47] war the Bible talks about wo wo World
[1:10:51] War I World War II and it says World War
[1:10:56] three for
[1:10:58] behold this Earth as an oven shall
[1:11:02] Burn Right but thank God he sent Elijah

[1:11:11] first because this Earth is going to be
[1:11:13] cursed it's already been cursed by the
[1:11:16] by the Fall because man when the when
[1:11:19] man fell not only did Adam and Eve fall
[1:11:22] but the Earth fell too into a a cursed
[1:11:25] condition and now that's why we're

[1:12:56] this he didn't have to go to the lengths
[1:12:58] of oh God did this God did that all he
[1:13:00] had to do is speak because there was a
[1:13:02] word of logos in his attribute that
[1:13:06] spoke out when he said are you a
[1:13:08] Christian that wasn't God saying are you
[1:13:10] a Christian God was saying come my son

[1:16:10] let's move on here Ephesians chapter 3
[1:16:14] 8-9 unto me who am less than the least
[1:16:18] of all the saints is this Grace
[1:16:21] given you mean the words come to me and
[1:16:23] I I I I I'm I'm I'm unveiling the
[1:16:26] mystery of God yeah you are that I
[1:16:29] should preach among the Gentiles The
[1:16:31] unsearchable Riches of Christ you know
[1:16:34] that you're all Ministers of the word of
[1:16:36] God when you've received the Holy Ghost
[1:16:39] your testimony as a woman as a housewife
[1:16:43] you know your your testimony the way you
[1:16:45] dress the way you handle yourself the
[1:16:47] way you talk the way you respect your
[1:16:49] husband and and the way he respects you
[1:16:52] shows the spirit of Christ the reality
[1:16:56] of Jesus Christ the word amen hallelujah
[1:16:59] should be preached among the Gentiles
[1:17:01] The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to
[1:17:04] make all men see what is the Fellowship
[1:17:06] of the true
[1:17:09] mystery The Fellowship of the mystery is
[1:17:12] not sitting with somebody and
[1:17:14] fellowshipping over the Serpent's
[1:17:16] Seed and arguing whether it was an apple
[1:17:20] or whether it was an
[1:17:23] adultery because I'll tell you
[1:17:26] something when those seals were
[1:17:29] open and the Word was unveiled under
[1:17:33] those Seven
[1:17:35] Seals it
[1:17:37] unveiled the mystery read it Revelations
[1:17:40] 10
[1:17:42] 1-7 the mystery of Christ should be
[1:17:47] revealed not
[1:17:49] Mysteries but there's things in that
[1:17:52] mystery that needs to be unveiled
[1:17:55] and when you see what the true mystery
[1:17:57] of Christ is how it was important to see
[1:18:00] and to recognize what God was doing back
[1:18:03] in Genesis in Adam and in Eve and then
[1:18:07] you start to identify and see what's
[1:18:10] going on all the way through down from
[1:18:12] Genesis all the way you start to you
[1:18:14] start to fall the you start to follow
[1:18:17] the trail of the
[1:18:18] serpent then you won't have to be
[1:18:21] convinced of what happened back in the
[1:18:23] Garden of Eden you won't have to be
[1:18:25] convinced that it was a serpent that
[1:18:27] that had committed sex with Eve that it
[1:18:31] was not some snake but it was an upright
[1:18:34] being then you'll see we're going to be
[1:18:37] looking a little deeper into it don't
[1:18:38] let me get ahead of of myself here he
[1:18:41] says here which this mystery which from
[1:18:45] the beginning of the world hath been hid
[1:18:48] in God in
[1:18:51] Christ this was hidden in him from
[1:18:54] before the foundations of the world
[1:18:56] remember he wanted to express himself
[1:19:00] and this is the great mystery it's all
[1:19:03] it's this great mystery you're going to
[1:19:05] come to realize it's all in in relation
[1:19:08] to man this great mystery is all in
[1:19:11] relation to man we we we don't realize
[1:19:13] why is it that we are man why why is it
[1:19:15] that we had to come into human form that
[1:19:18] that that was in the form of man because
[1:19:22] God hid in that mystery of man we're
[1:19:26] going to look at it we're going to we're
[1:19:27] going to keep moving through here and
[1:19:28] just see how the Holy Spirit reveals it
[1:19:30] and makes it more clear even to me
[1:19:33] because while I was studying this and
[1:19:34] reading and and and and listening I was
[1:19:37] I was rejoicing listen you think that I
[1:19:40] go and spend a 100 hours a week trying
[1:19:43] to figure all of this
[1:19:45] out are you out of your
[1:19:47] mind I can't do that I don't even have
[1:19:50] the physical strength to do
[1:19:52] that it's a I got to feed on the word I
[1:19:56] got to go listen to other ministers
[1:19:58] because I believe there's ministers what
[1:20:00] what you think God is only speaking here
[1:20:02] God is speaking in his body all over the
[1:20:05] world there are ministers that have the
[1:20:07] Holy Spirit that have God in them
[1:20:10] they're they they're ministering the
[1:20:11] word of God and they catch a thought
[1:20:13] like me I'm listening to this Minister
[1:20:15] and all of a sudden boom all these
[1:20:17] thoughts start poting into my mind not
[1:20:19] only am I hearing what he's saying I'm
[1:20:20] hearing what he's telling me just like
[1:20:23] this morning my wife heard me I was
[1:20:25] rejoicing she heard me rejoicing you
[1:20:27] know in in in the uh in our bedroom I
[1:20:29] was re she goes what are you Hallelujah
[1:20:32] about I said God's unveiling something
[1:20:34] to me right now it's it's glorious he's
[1:20:37] showing me how this word progresses and
[1:20:40] moves from one to the other to the other
[1:20:42] and how it's bringing in the fullness of
[1:20:44] the body of Christ and how it's drawing
[1:20:46] the the the sons and daughters together
[1:20:49] I I was listening to this Minister and
[1:20:51] all of a sudden now this scripture comes
[1:20:52] alive to me over here
[1:20:55] you know in in in Thessalonians because
[1:20:57] all of a sudden what he's preaching and
[1:21:00] the Revelation that God is unveiling
[1:21:02] through him it's not his
[1:21:04] Revelation it's God in him it's God
[1:21:08] speaking through the body it's the
[1:21:10] five-fold ministry that's why we we get
[1:21:13] excited when when when a minister comes
[1:21:15] through here and he's yielded to the
[1:21:17] spirit of God and he has a Ministry on
[1:21:19] him you know that it's not his ability
[1:21:22] to memorize quotes and and pick out
[1:21:25] quotes and identify this and that listen
[1:21:28] if I don't listen to other ministers
[1:21:30] that are feeding on the word and that
[1:21:32] have come and surrendered themselves
[1:21:35] where am I going to get fed from I get
[1:21:38] fed because
[1:21:40] faith comes by hearing the word and God
[1:21:44] chose the foolishness of
[1:21:46] preaching God will speak as we're
[1:21:49] ministering the word here God will speak
[1:21:51] right back to us he'll speak to me he'll
[1:21:54] inv certain things and sometimes you'll
[1:21:56] hear it and you'll say oh well that was
[1:21:57] fresh hallelujah praise God God just
[1:22:00] showing himself in the midst of the
[1:22:03] five-fold ministry how he's building
[1:22:05] this body how he's adding to the church
[1:22:08] you think oh I'm going to go to that
[1:22:09] church I feel L I just want to go to
[1:22:11] that church you know there's there's
[1:22:13] individuals that are moving right now
[1:22:14] there's there's there's things going on
[1:22:16] right now within the body of Christ they
[1:22:18] got it all they're doing is they're
[1:22:20] being led by the spirit amen and God
[1:22:23] will confirm your move God will
[1:22:26] vindicate why you are supposed to be
[1:22:28] here in such a time as this because
[1:22:31] there's a portion of word in you that
[1:22:33] needs to find its place needs to get
[1:22:36] into its rightful position so that it
[1:22:38] can fulfill God's purpose his will his
[1:22:41] desire this is what we read at the
[1:22:43] beginning it's his will his purpose
[1:22:46] that's what we want because his will and
[1:22:48] his purpose is to change you to
[1:22:51] transform you to translate you and we as
[1:22:54] ministers we can only unveil words words
[1:22:59] God chose the foolishness of words to
[1:23:02] preach his gospel but he chose his
[1:23:05] Spirit to open and to break the bread of
[1:23:08] life to you
[1:23:11] personal that's why the letter kills but
[1:23:14] the spirit brings it alive it gives you
[1:23:17] confidence to know I'm serving God this
[1:23:20] is not something I put on this is not
[1:23:22] something that I'm trying to do I'm
[1:23:23] trying to make myself something I want
[1:23:25] to be nothing Lord Jesus the more that I
[1:23:29] see this this gospel in the way that
[1:23:31] he's this is all about him we can't get
[1:23:34] in his way we got to let him have his
[1:23:36] way we got to allow him to speak to the
[1:23:38] very needs and the hearts and the call
[1:23:40] and place and to do what he's got to do
[1:23:43] I don't want my own ideas oh I think
[1:23:45] this brother's you know he's got this
[1:23:47] you know he he'd be good to do this and
[1:23:49] that I wait on the
[1:23:53] Lord God will work at both ends yes God
[1:23:56] will make it clear what exactly their
[1:23:58] position is they got to just sit still
[1:24:01] and wait on the Lord that's all they got
[1:24:04] to do and God will do it because he's
[1:24:07] got a purpose and a will for each and
[1:24:09] every attribute of God you can't miss
[1:24:12] this if you wanted to miss it because
[1:24:14] he's given you the unsearchable riches
[1:24:17] of his word who created all things that
[1:24:21] are hidden God and who created All
[1:24:23] Things by who
[1:24:25] but wait a minute I thought God in the
[1:24:28] beginning created all things but this
[1:24:31] says Jesus Christ created all
[1:24:37] things exactly brother
[1:24:41] Gabriel Jesus is only a
[1:24:43] name Jesus is only a a a a way that we
[1:24:47] identify him in his
[1:24:51] sunship in his in why he had to come as
[1:24:54] a son of man right because he's he's
[1:24:58] quoted as the second
[1:25:00] Adam who was the first
[1:25:02] Adam Jesus Christ when God expressed
[1:25:06] Adam onto the Earth do you know that
[1:25:09] Adam was the lowest form of God at that
[1:25:14] point
[1:25:16] Hallelujah Adam was made in the lowest
[1:25:20] form of God's thoughts when he expressed
[1:25:24] him on to the Earth in the form of a man
[1:25:29] man is the lowest form of
[1:25:32] God don't think man is because Jesus
[1:25:36] came as a man that that makes him the
[1:25:39] highest form no no the highest form is
[1:25:41] Elohim the self-existent one the one who
[1:25:44] sat on the throne the one with supreme
[1:25:48] authority Hallelujah glory to God you're
[1:25:51] going to see this we're going to be
[1:25:52] looking at all this let's let's move
[1:25:53] along here there's no way we're going to
[1:25:55] get through all of this today but praise
[1:25:58] God let's Rejoice around the word of God
[1:26:01] let's go to the next scripture we're
[1:26:02] going to look at here how the condens uh
[1:26:05] condescension took place how God em
[1:26:07] morphed himself how he's doing it now
[1:26:10] and in this hour and how you are an
[1:26:12] attribute word of God you're your your
[1:26:14] your your time has come your word the
[1:26:17] the season for you has come you need to
[1:26:20] come to realize that there's got to be a
[1:26:22] time where you realize hey wait a minute
[1:26:23] here I've been going to church for so
[1:26:25] many years I've been I I believe I
[1:26:28] believe this message I believe that this
[1:26:29] is is going on but wait a minute here I
[1:26:31] want more of God if you don't want more
[1:26:34] of God you need to get back on your
[1:26:35] knees because this Revelation is never
[1:26:38] going to stop that's what makes him
[1:26:41] Eternal how how in the world can you be
[1:26:44] as ex more excited about the word today
[1:26:47] than you were when you came in how is
[1:26:49] that because he's unveiling himself now
[1:26:53] person personal doing things in your
[1:26:56] life that nobody else can do it you know
[1:26:58] it's God and if you're not experiencing
[1:27:01] that then get closer by by by
[1:27:04] consecrating yourself reading the word
[1:27:06] of God being in the house of the Lord
[1:27:08] more often being in the in the word
[1:27:10] listening to the messages listening to
[1:27:12] brother brandham listening to the voice
[1:27:14] of God speak in all areas of your
[1:27:19] life amen glory who in the days Hebrews
[1:27:23] let's go to the next
[1:27:27] scripture was that the next
[1:27:30] scripture yes Hebrews 57
[1:27:35] to10 who in the days of his flesh he
[1:27:38] talking about the
[1:27:39] Lord when he had offered up prayers and
[1:27:43] supplications with strong crying and
[1:27:44] tears unto him that was able to save him
[1:27:47] from Death he's talking about his
[1:27:48] experience in the garden do you know
[1:27:50] that Jesus Christ in the form of a man
[1:27:55] had to learn obedience in this world had
[1:27:57] to overcome The Temptations the same way
[1:28:00] that you overcome them because he's
[1:28:02] overcome them for you by him overcoming
[1:28:05] them and then taking them to the Cross
[1:28:07] he settled it once and for all so that
[1:28:10] you don't have to carry that that
[1:28:12] condemnation anymore you you there's
[1:28:16] things you've done in your life and you
[1:28:17] can't go back and you can't reverse it
[1:28:20] but he
[1:28:21] can by his word he can say you're
[1:28:24] Justified as though you never done
[1:28:29] it who was able God Jesus knew that all
[1:28:32] he had to do was just look to
[1:28:36] himself he's God he could change
[1:28:39] anything but he would not go against his
[1:28:42] own word and that's why you can trust
[1:28:45] him that's why you can take him at his
[1:28:48] word you can stand there you can let
[1:28:50] every storm go by you can let every
[1:28:53] bullet go by it's going to miss you it
[1:28:56] has to miss you if God's got a purpose
[1:28:58] for you there ain't a sickness in hell
[1:29:01] that can bring you down as an attribute
[1:29:02] of God he's got to fulfill that purpose
[1:29:05] in your life amen glory to God save him
[1:29:08] from death and was heard in that he even
[1:29:11] feared oh God imagine that so don't
[1:29:14] think it's wrong that you know you know
[1:29:16] that you can't fear you
[1:29:18] fear we're
[1:29:21] human but know that he's the one that
[1:29:23] said fear not listen to that voice that
[1:29:27] that that that can can overcome that
[1:29:29] situation that you're being held into
[1:29:32] anxiety about you might be facing
[1:29:35] situations right now and there's anxiety
[1:29:37] around your life you don't know what to
[1:29:39] do you're just you you're just wondering
[1:29:41] well I'm just going to say you lean not
[1:29:43] upon your own thoughts your own uh you
[1:29:46] know lies that will come to your mind
[1:29:48] the enemy is going to try to lie to you
[1:29:49] that's his job the greatest battle that
[1:29:52] you will ever fight will be right
[1:29:53] between your your ears whether you're
[1:29:55] going to believe the word or you're
[1:29:57] going to believe the enemy I did this to
[1:29:59] you I'm going to destroy your life I'm
[1:30:01] going to take you I'm going to mess you
[1:30:03] up I'm going to make you asham I'm gonna
[1:30:05] do this and all of a sudden you're
[1:30:07] you're you're believing that those lies
[1:30:09] and anxiety starts to come upon your
[1:30:11] life and you you feel surrounded I'm
[1:30:13] telling you God says be
[1:30:15] still and know that I am
[1:30:18] God believe that I can deal with it
[1:30:22] believe that that if you trust me with
[1:30:24] all of your heart then I'll make a way
[1:30:26] for you because his word cannot return
[1:30:30] void and if he's placed a portion of his
[1:30:32] word in you that word's got to come
[1:30:34] Jesus said all that the father hath
[1:30:36] given me will come not one of you will
[1:30:39] be lost don't
[1:30:42] fear he took that fear to the
[1:30:45] Cross he pinned it right there and he
[1:30:47] says it's
[1:30:49] finished Hallelujah and was heard in
[1:30:52] that he feared though he were a son yet
[1:30:55] learned he obedience by the things which
[1:30:58] he suffered so if Jesus Christ had to
[1:31:03] suffer through Temptations and through
[1:31:06] situations and had to become obedient to
[1:31:09] those situ oh no I'm I got God in Me
[1:31:13] God's going to overcome everything in
[1:31:16] me the first thing that he's going to
[1:31:18] overcome is
[1:31:22] you your pride
[1:31:24] your thoughts and your ideas of how you
[1:31:26] think it ought to be you need to take
[1:31:30] our Lord as a sample and as an example
[1:31:33] that he had to come under obedience he
[1:31:36] had to submit himself to the word of God
[1:31:40] to what God had ordained in him would
[1:31:43] place in him to fulfill his word amen
[1:31:45] glory to God and here he says and and
[1:31:49] being made perfect he became the author
[1:31:52] of eternal salvation in other words this
[1:31:56] salvation that he that he authored it
[1:31:59] there's no end to it so if you're saved
[1:32:03] you're not going to be
[1:32:04] lost hallelujah it's Eternal your
[1:32:08] salvation had no beginning it's going to
[1:32:10] have no end because you were in him amen
[1:32:13] this is what you're going to come to
[1:32:14] realize this is the the the the mystery
[1:32:17] of Christ this the thing that he kept
[1:32:19] hidden right from the right right from
[1:32:21] the beginning of the world you when we
[1:32:23] come to it you're going to say what
[1:32:24] that's what it was yeah is as simple as
[1:32:27] that God hides himself in Simplicity and
[1:32:30] he reveals himself in the same way he
[1:32:32] doesn't change that's the beauty of
[1:32:35] knowing him and he became the author of
[1:32:37] Eternal salvation unto all them
[1:32:40] that
[1:32:43] obey you mean you don't only need to
[1:32:45] believe but you actually need to
[1:32:47] obey
[1:32:49] yeah people don't want to come under
[1:32:52] obedience to the leadership even in the
[1:32:55] church they don't want to some people
[1:32:57] they I don't need a
[1:33:01] pastor I'm just fine I I don't need
[1:33:04] pastors meanwhile it's part of the
[1:33:06] fivefold ministry so you don't need
[1:33:07] Ephesians chapter 4 then is that what
[1:33:09] you're
[1:33:10] saying I don't need evangelists I don't
[1:33:12] need I don't need this I don't need that
[1:33:14] no no no you do need it more than the
[1:33:16] fact that you're saying it tells me you
[1:33:18] need it even
[1:33:19] more because this revelation
[1:33:23] is Christ and he says we need to
[1:33:27] recognize and come under subjection and
[1:33:30] obedience to him we're not coming under
[1:33:33] obedience to man but God places Kings
[1:33:37] for a purpose God places them in their
[1:33:40] Thrones and God removes them from their
[1:33:42] Thrones am and once we come to realize
[1:33:45] that then we just need to understand
[1:33:48] that like David when Saul was after his
[1:33:51] own
[1:33:52] life and God gave Saul right into his
[1:33:56] own hands David he could have just slid
[1:33:58] his throat right there he brought him
[1:34:00] right into the cave was standing over
[1:34:01] him while he was
[1:34:03] sleeping but David knew do not touch my
[1:34:09] anointed if Nebuchadnezzar you want to
[1:34:12] go back and read it in in in
[1:34:14] Jeremiah I'm going to
[1:34:17] send
[1:34:18] Nebuchadnezzar my
[1:34:21] servant my servant
[1:34:24] and he's going to take you all captive
[1:34:26] he's going to destroy man woman child
[1:34:28] that doesn't that doesn't hearken unto
[1:34:30] my word and I'm going to take them out
[1:34:32] and bring them into Babylon for 70 years
[1:34:35] of
[1:34:36] captivity oh yeah God uses anybody he
[1:34:41] brings he puts those people into those
[1:34:44] positions they might be there for a
[1:34:46] short time for a a long time for
[1:34:48] whatever time but you come subject to
[1:34:52] Christ the word
[1:34:54] and his word once you obey that word and
[1:34:56] you submit to that word you open up
[1:34:59] every spiritual blessing that is
[1:35:01] rightfully yours you could be gifted you
[1:35:04] could be gifted in so many different
[1:35:06] ways but a spirit of Disobedience not
[1:35:10] willing to submit will keep that gift
[1:35:14] locked
[1:35:16] up and
[1:35:18] ineffective you wonder why why why am I
[1:35:21] not feeling the joy of the Lord why am I
[1:35:23] not feeling the blessings of God why am
[1:35:25] I not feeling you know anointed to to to
[1:35:28] do the things that I'm doing if you're
[1:35:30] doing service unto the Lord in the house
[1:35:33] of the Lord if it's genuine Revelation
[1:35:36] you're doing it with the joy of the
[1:35:40] Lord while you're doing it it's the joy
[1:35:42] of the Lord it becomes your strength to
[1:35:45] actually do it if you're if you're
[1:35:49] miserable oh they're leaving early no
[1:35:51] they're going to leave me to do it all
[1:35:53] don't look at
[1:35:55] that don't pay attention to any of that
[1:35:58] do your part amen and all of a sudden
[1:36:01] God's going to send you helpers all of a
[1:36:03] sudden God it's even at work it's the
[1:36:05] same thing you go to work and you're
[1:36:07] working there and you know the other
[1:36:08] guys are hiding and they're letting you
[1:36:10] do it all that's okay I'm going to do it
[1:36:12] all but one of these days I'll be
[1:36:14] telling you what to do I I've seen it
[1:36:17] happen I've experienced it okay that's
[1:36:20] why I tell you you go to work do more
[1:36:23] than what you're being paid for amen
[1:36:25] you'll get paid more than what you're
[1:36:27] doing one of these days amen glory to
[1:36:29] God there's a saying and I'm going to
[1:36:30] say it again you do what you got to do
[1:36:32] when you got to do it the time will come
[1:36:34] that you can do what you want to do when
[1:36:35] you want to do
[1:36:39] it think about it somebody told me that
[1:36:43] one day and I
[1:36:45] said that makes a lot of
[1:36:48] sense because I want to do what I want
[1:36:50] to do when I want to do it isn't that
[1:36:52] your desire
[1:36:55] glory to God we do more we get blessed
[1:36:58] more and that's how we should look at
[1:37:01] being a part of the body and and
[1:37:03] edifying one another and and being
[1:37:05] somebody that's an encourager that's
[1:37:08] always looking to encourage to build up
[1:37:11] to strengthen don't worry the Holy
[1:37:12] Spirit has deacons and and uh
[1:37:15] individuals that will correct and deal
[1:37:17] with circumstances and situations and if
[1:37:20] you stay
[1:37:22] submited to God
[1:37:24] go when that correction
[1:37:27] comes you will
[1:37:29] rejoice you will not
[1:37:33] Rebel you get brought into the office
[1:37:35] you get corrected you get dealt with
[1:37:37] situations this and that the following
[1:37:39] week don't see you anymore the week
[1:37:41] after don't see you anymore you know
[1:37:43] what that tells me you're more
[1:37:45] rebellious than you were when you were
[1:37:46] in the
[1:37:48] office because you're not willing to
[1:37:50] submit to God it's not man that we
[1:37:54] submit to it's to the Holy Spirit
[1:37:56] remember this is all about building
[1:37:59] character God wants to seek character in
[1:38:02] us because he's preparing us for the
[1:38:04] next stage which is going to be to
[1:38:08] rule go back and read and see what he
[1:38:12] promises to them in Le oysa to them that
[1:38:15] overcome will I allow to sit with me
[1:38:21] where you know what a throne is e it's a
[1:38:24] place of
[1:38:26] authority there's a reason why God is
[1:38:29] dealing with you God is perfecting you
[1:38:33] God is is strengthening you God is
[1:38:35] setting you free from all the things
[1:38:37] that that are holding you back be
[1:38:40] willing to obey be willing to step up be
[1:38:43] will be willing to move into those
[1:38:45] positions be do it with a joyful
[1:38:48] cheerful when you give cheerfully give
[1:38:51] if you've got to put it on for a while
[1:38:53] till God gets rid of all that carnality
[1:38:56] in you that's okay cheerfully give say
[1:38:59] glory to God Lord I give to you
[1:39:02] Hallelujah and start laughing and saying
[1:39:04] I'm blessed I'm blessed you're going to
[1:39:07] pour out blessing upon blessing Lord in
[1:39:10] your time and in your season you know
[1:39:12] exactly what I have need of I'm blessed
[1:39:15] just move in that direction and let the
[1:39:17] holy spiritu vindicate his own
[1:39:21] word this is not something you got to do
[1:39:24] this is something you surrender
[1:39:26] to
[1:39:29] Hallelujah and being made perfect he
[1:39:31] became the
[1:39:32] author of Eternal salvation unto all
[1:39:35] them that obey him called of God and
[1:39:40] high priest after the order of
[1:39:43] MDC praise God so here we are now we're
[1:39:47] seeing remember God had a purpose in
[1:39:52] fulfilling
[1:39:54] and opening the book so that we could
[1:39:57] understand where we sit where we stand
[1:39:59] who we are what part are we in this book
[1:40:02] how do we fit into this book what's
[1:40:05] being unveiled right now this book has
[1:40:07] been opened brother Bram went and opened
[1:40:09] those Seven Seals what it did was it
[1:40:10] brought Christ to the Earth for the
[1:40:13] purpose and when you and and look I'm
[1:40:15] not going to go ahead let's go to the
[1:40:16] next let's read on here because
[1:40:19] then I got to I got to stay focused amen
[1:40:24] and stay the way the Lord wants me to
[1:40:25] bring it amen now listen here he says
[1:40:28] here and who is this mzc and then when
[1:40:31] you become subject to that
[1:40:33] Spirit it throws your whole being
[1:40:36] subject to that
[1:40:38] Spirit remember what we were talking
[1:40:40] about about obeying and coming under the
[1:40:42] leadership of the Holy Spirit and and
[1:40:44] and what what's what's being identified
[1:40:46] in you is that the word the attribute a
[1:40:49] part of God is actually in you because
[1:40:51] there's millions of Christian churches
[1:40:53] is out there and people are like robots
[1:40:56] they go in
[1:40:57] there Mary name of the you know then
[1:41:02] they'll go to the Black Box oh wait a
[1:41:03] minut I got to go confess my sins from
[1:41:04] last week I'll be right back they'll go
[1:41:06] in there they get there oh forgive me
[1:41:08] I've sinned they'll tell them all about
[1:41:10] what they did they leave there and they
[1:41:11] feel good what is
[1:41:13] that show me in the word where that is
[1:41:18] it's it's nowhere in the
[1:41:20] word when the Holy Spirit comes upon an
[1:41:22] indiv
[1:41:23] idual it changes their lives they don't
[1:41:26] go back to what they did last
[1:41:29] week they don't need to repent again
[1:41:32] over like yeah we do make mistakes and
[1:41:34] we'll make those same mistakes from time
[1:41:36] to time but that's not what I'm talking
[1:41:38] about here there's no Revelation that
[1:41:41] the blood of Christ has already forgiven
[1:41:44] them and that they are Justified as
[1:41:47] though they never done it in the first
[1:41:48] place that's the kind of relationship
[1:41:51] that God is looking for with man
[1:41:55] so the whole being becomes subject to
[1:41:58] that spirit and that spirit is nothing
[1:42:00] in the world but this seed word made
[1:42:03] manifest or quickened Hallelujah Made
[1:42:05] Alive so he's saying here that spirit is
[1:42:09] the word that's in
[1:42:10] you it's the portion of God that's in
[1:42:13] you it's the seed that he placed in you
[1:42:15] that's why we've read the parable of the
[1:42:17] soore and there was good seed and it
[1:42:18] fell on good ground well you are good
[1:42:21] ground if youve received the seed
[1:42:23] because the Bible says and the seed that
[1:42:26] the soar was seeing was the word of God
[1:42:30] that's what he was sewing his word and
[1:42:34] so that's what's coming
[1:42:35] forth the seed word made manifest or
[1:42:39] quickened and when the Bible said don't
[1:42:41] do this that body quickly turns to it
[1:42:44] there's no question and what it is it's
[1:42:47] the earnest of the Resurrection this
[1:42:50] body will be raised up again because
[1:42:52] it's already started it was once subject
[1:42:55] to sin and meire and Corruption but now
[1:42:59] it's got the earnest and what is the
[1:43:01] earnest it's the resurrection it's the
[1:43:05] spirit of Jesus Christ it's the holy
[1:43:07] ghost that you are entitled to when you
[1:43:10] are
[1:43:10] baptized according to the word of God
[1:43:13] not because you're going in a wet sinner
[1:43:16] and coming a dry sinner coming out a wet
[1:43:18] sinner not because of works it's not by
[1:43:20] works but because something gets
[1:43:22] revealed revealed to you on the inside
[1:43:25] that you now know you're
[1:43:28] dirty I'm I'm a sinner and I want to be
[1:43:32] cleaned I I I know I'm I'm wrong I I've
[1:43:35] been living wrong and I don't want to
[1:43:36] live that way anymore and then you go to
[1:43:38] the water then you're buried into the
[1:43:41] water and your life of the old is buried
[1:43:45] like like being buried six feet
[1:43:47] underground you get buried into the
[1:43:49] water when you come out of the water all
[1:43:52] the sin and un belief gets drowned into
[1:43:54] the water and your past gets wiped out
[1:43:58] and the spirit of God now comes and
[1:44:00] fills a clean vessel and now starts to
[1:44:03] do a work in you that's only the
[1:44:06] beginning that's only the beginning
[1:44:08] every birth is a
[1:44:09] mess every single birth there's a mess
[1:44:12] in every birth so don't think oh I'm
[1:44:14] going to get baptized be fine no no
[1:44:16] you're going to become a
[1:44:17] Target and the enem is going to try to
[1:44:19] turn you around oh that that that
[1:44:23] brother Danny over there that Minister
[1:44:25] he's preaching on this and that and boy
[1:44:27] it was really striking my heart it was
[1:44:29] like man that's the truth
[1:44:32] but ah the battles are too hard and I
[1:44:35] think I'm just gonna leave
[1:44:37] it you know my family's going to start
[1:44:40] thinking I'm
[1:44:42] cuckoo I'm G to go to work and they're
[1:44:44] going to see a different how come you
[1:44:46] don't swear anymore there
[1:44:48] partner I'm not hearing that word coming
[1:44:50] out of you what is that what's going
[1:44:54] on you know you're well I you know I I
[1:44:57] just you know tell
[1:45:02] them I got delivered from that thing I'm
[1:45:06] free I'm I'm now serving the Living God
[1:45:10] I found Jesus if you really want to know
[1:45:12] what happened I saw the light and I
[1:45:14] realized that my life was going the
[1:45:16] wrong way and no matter how I looked
[1:45:18] back in every situation it it was ugly I
[1:45:21] didn't like this situ I didn't like that
[1:45:22] sit I didn't like that one he says all
[1:45:25] things will be brand new and I look this
[1:45:27] way he shows me a brand new start he
[1:45:29] gives me brand new opportunity I can
[1:45:32] change the way I can you know you keep
[1:45:34] doing what you're doing you keep getting
[1:45:36] what you
[1:45:38] got thank you Lord so you need to change
[1:45:40] what you're doing if you want to change
[1:45:42] what you got it's as simple as that
[1:45:46] Hallelujah and so he goes on here he
[1:45:49] says there's no question because it's
[1:45:51] already started it was once subject to
[1:45:54] sin Meer and Corruption but now it's got
[1:45:56] the earnest and now it's got the
[1:45:58] resurrection power it's turned Heavenly
[1:46:00] now that's the earnest that you're going
[1:46:03] in the Rapture did you hear that that
[1:46:06] shows that you're actually identified
[1:46:09] with the church that is going to be
[1:46:12] going in the Rapture there's a lot of
[1:46:13] people talking about Rapture out there
[1:46:16] they'll preach Rapture they'll talk
[1:46:17] about Rapture but they got no
[1:46:19] idea that going through hell
[1:46:23] and deliverance and being set free from
[1:46:26] the things and the and the the bondage
[1:46:28] of of generational spirits that that
[1:46:31] came down through your life and and and
[1:46:33] scars from your past and bad experiences
[1:46:36] traumatic events those are things that
[1:46:40] God wants to set you free from because
[1:46:42] you're not going to take those things
[1:46:43] with
[1:46:45] you that's why Jesus said he that is
[1:46:47] heavy laden let him come unto me I'll
[1:46:50] give you
[1:46:51] rest I'll take the those burdens I'll
[1:46:53] take those things that are on you and
[1:46:55] I'll give you a free life of of of joy
[1:46:59] unspeakable in full of glory amen now
[1:47:02] that's the Rapture go to the next slide
[1:47:04] here he says here it's the earnest a
[1:47:07] sick person laying dying nothing left
[1:47:10] but death that's all can happen I've
[1:47:13] seen a Shadows of people done eat up
[1:47:16] with
[1:47:17] cancer and tuberculosis and see them
[1:47:21] persons a little while after that
[1:47:23] perfectly normal and strong you go back
[1:47:26] and study the life of this Reverend
[1:47:29] William Branham and you will find out
[1:47:32] that he had a Supernatural Ministry of
[1:47:34] healing God put that gift into his life
[1:47:38] not just so that he could heal people so
[1:47:42] that he could draw the attention of the
[1:47:44] people to the
[1:47:46] word to the restored word the one that
[1:47:50] the world out there doesn't really want
[1:47:51] to know when you tell tell them you got
[1:47:54] how are you baptized I was baptized as a
[1:47:56] baby that's not baptism you got to be
[1:47:59] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:01] Christ as an adult he that believeth
[1:48:04] Jesus himself said he that believeth and
[1:48:07] is
[1:48:08] baptized what do you believe well I
[1:48:11] believe I was baptized as a
[1:48:13] baby and they'll just go on with that
[1:48:16] you see the word can never go against
[1:48:19] the word never never never never never
[1:48:23] Hallelujah and and William brandham had
[1:48:25] a Ministry that would draw the attention
[1:48:27] of the people through the Miracles
[1:48:29] through the healings through the raising
[1:48:31] of the Dead even doctors affidavits the
[1:48:34] whole bit no
[1:48:36] nonsense but yet he was drawing the
[1:48:38] people to the attention of what God was
[1:48:41] doing in our
[1:48:42] day Hallelujah you got to go back and
[1:48:45] study that for yourself a little while
[1:48:47] after that perfectly normal and strong
[1:48:50] if there's no Divine Healing then
[1:48:51] there's no Resurrection
[1:48:54] because Divine Healing he says cuz
[1:48:57] Divine Healing is the earnest of the
[1:48:59] Resurrection amen he says you know
[1:49:01] what's the earnest money is don't you
[1:49:04] it's the down payment he was wounded for
[1:49:06] our
[1:49:07] transgressions with his stripes we were
[1:49:11] healed not not will be we
[1:49:14] were passed done you accept Christ your
[1:49:18] your healing can start right now right
[1:49:20] this morning that healing can start
[1:49:23] how long it takes that's up to the Lord
[1:49:25] hallelujah he was wounded for our
[1:49:27] transgressions we love him now this body
[1:49:30] is subject to the spirit have not yet
[1:49:33] entered into the word form you see
[1:49:37] that's that's the translation that's the
[1:49:39] change that's now going on in our lives
[1:49:42] that's the element that is the secret
[1:49:45] part of how God is going to take you and
[1:49:48] how God is going to change you and in
[1:49:50] the moment in the twinkl of an eye
[1:49:52] you're going to be changed
[1:49:53] but there's a there there's a process
[1:49:55] that you you're you're going back to the
[1:49:57] word you always were the word but you're
[1:50:00] not aware you're not
[1:50:03] conscious because the book has been
[1:50:05] opened to unveil who you really are but
[1:50:09] you're not fully aware and this is what
[1:50:11] this ministry and preaching is all about
[1:50:14] to bring us into that awareness let's go
[1:50:16] on you have not yet entered into that
[1:50:18] word form but we are still in flesh form
[1:50:21] but subject to the word that's why
[1:50:24] you're you're willing to come subject to
[1:50:26] the word for this day and for this hour
[1:50:28] it identifies that the word is actually
[1:50:30] in you that's why when somebody hears
[1:50:32] this message that God sent a prophet
[1:50:35] proper you know going back to the word
[1:50:38] you know the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:50:40] we're going to be doing a series on that
[1:50:42] okay the Lord's already showed me
[1:50:44] because you know these are things that
[1:50:46] that that pertain to now we need to
[1:50:49] unveil every seal we know that the seals
[1:50:52] have been open and all the mystery's
[1:50:53] been revealed it's not we're not going
[1:50:55] to reveal anything new it's all been
[1:50:58] revealed just that you're not aware of
[1:51:00] it yet until we become fully conscious
[1:51:04] of what God is doing that'll produce the
[1:51:07] Rapture amen glory to God but subject to
[1:51:11] the word let's move on we're gonna we're
[1:51:12] going to close here let the musicians
[1:51:13] come we're going to read two more quotes
[1:51:15] and we're going to close and we're going
[1:51:16] to continue next week then when a man is
[1:51:19] Born Again from Heaven he becomes a
[1:51:22] spirit babe in
[1:51:24] Christ and then when the robe of flesh
[1:51:27] is dropped there is a natural
[1:51:30] body theophany a body not made with
[1:51:34] hands neither born of a woman that we go
[1:51:37] to so that's the body that Paul's
[1:51:39] talking about that once this Earthly
[1:51:41] Tabernacle be dissolved we get into that
[1:51:44] theophany body but there's a purpose for
[1:51:46] the
[1:51:48] theophany then that body returns back
[1:51:52] picks up the glorified body the person
[1:51:55] that you were because we're going to be
[1:51:57] on earth for another thousand years
[1:52:00] you're going to say oh
[1:52:03] no you mean you mean we got to come back
[1:52:06] here for another Thousand Years the
[1:52:09] Millennium you mean we're going to be
[1:52:10] the ones that are coming riding on those
[1:52:12] white horses after the three and a
[1:52:14] because you go in the Rapture for a
[1:52:16] three and a half year vacation
[1:52:19] honeymoon Fellowship Gathering we which
[1:52:22] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:52:24] together to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:52:26] this world goes into the fullblown
[1:52:29] tribulation and 3 and a half years later
[1:52:31] we got to come back and we bind up Satan
[1:52:36] by the power that is in us as Sons and
[1:52:41] Daughters of God that's right that's
[1:52:43] right attribute word
[1:52:47] theophany Eternal bodies so don't worry
[1:52:50] the Millennium for the sons and
[1:52:52] Daughters of God will not have to deal
[1:52:54] with anything that you've been dealing
[1:52:57] with over the last 30 40 20 15 80 90
[1:53:02] years while you've been on this Earth
[1:53:04] you will not experience any sickness you
[1:53:06] will not experience any sorrow
[1:53:08] Hallelujah and this robe of flesh is
[1:53:11] dropped then a natural body theophany a
[1:53:13] body made with with not made with hands
[1:53:16] neither born of a woman that we go to
[1:53:19] then that body returns back picks up the
[1:53:20] glorified body that that's the reason
[1:53:23] Jesus went to hell when he died and he
[1:53:25] preached to the souls that were in
[1:53:27] prison remember everything in type form
[1:53:30] everything revealed in type form what
[1:53:32] he's going to be doing amen that's why
[1:53:34] the first resurrection he went to to set
[1:53:38] free those that were in the Old
[1:53:40] Testament Bound by sin and unbelief now
[1:53:44] the sacrifice had been made it was no
[1:53:47] longer a sacrificial lamb that they had
[1:53:50] to Slit its throat it was now now Jesus
[1:53:53] Christ the Lamb of God he had paid the
[1:53:55] full price and now those which were dead
[1:53:59] would were not hinder they came up and
[1:54:01] they joined those which were alive in
[1:54:03] order to begin and move towards the
[1:54:07] second
[1:54:08] Resurrection Hallelujah and so that then
[1:54:12] that body returns Jesus went to hell
[1:54:14] when he died and preached the souls that
[1:54:16] were in prison turned back into that
[1:54:18] theophany oh marvelous thank God Second
[1:54:21] Corinthians if this Earth body be
[1:54:23] dissolved this this Earthly Tabernacle
[1:54:26] we have another one see we have bypassed
[1:54:30] that to come straight from God the
[1:54:33] attribute to be flesh to be tempted and
[1:54:36] tested by sin like Adam did did you hear
[1:54:41] what he said
[1:54:42] there listen Adam and Eve in the
[1:54:46] beginning they were Eternal Adam was an
[1:54:49] expression of God
[1:54:53] Adam was God let's get this straight Eve
[1:54:57] was in Adam when Eve was pulled out of
[1:55:02] Adam she was the female aspect of
[1:55:07] God just like the church the bride she
[1:55:11] is the female aspect of God Amen and all
[1:55:16] Jesus all Adam would have had to do was
[1:55:18] look to Eve and speak the word and and
[1:55:22] bring other attributes right out of his
[1:55:25] own mind because Adam was God he could
[1:55:27] name the animals he called them by their
[1:55:29] name he he he created he spoke every
[1:55:33] anything that he said that he had
[1:55:34] dominion over the Earth and he was given
[1:55:37] the ability to multiply that's what God
[1:55:39] Said now multiply
[1:55:41] yourself he could have multiplied and
[1:55:44] brought every single one of us out of
[1:55:46] that that that dimension of Elohim in
[1:55:49] the mind of God he could have just just
[1:55:51] called us into existence and we would
[1:55:54] have been right there in the Garden of
[1:55:55] Eden but Satan wanted to be like God he
[1:55:59] wanted to be worshiped like God now
[1:56:01] you'll understand why the serpent seed
[1:56:04] he goes to Eve he goes to Eve and he
[1:56:06] says
[1:56:07] hey you know that you can be like God
[1:56:11] they knew Adam knew what was going on
[1:56:14] Adam knew that he could speak the
[1:56:16] word but it was all part like the
[1:56:19] Paradox is that God wanted to be a
[1:56:21] redeemer God wanted to be a Healer God
[1:56:23] wanted to be a father so he he now the
[1:56:25] devil goes to Eve to pervert what God
[1:56:29] was supposed to do by the spoken word
[1:56:31] what Adam would do by the spoken word he
[1:56:34] goes and uses the word that Adam spoke
[1:56:37] that led every SE that God spoke that
[1:56:39] Adam spoke let every seed bring forth of
[1:56:41] its own
[1:56:43] kind and he uses that now to go and
[1:56:46] inject his seed as an upright human
[1:56:49] being
[1:56:52] to bring forth a
[1:56:55] son just like God wanted to do see
[1:56:58] there's the whole perversion now we'll
[1:57:01] continue this next week because it's
[1:57:03] just going to get
[1:57:04] sweeter okay you're going to see how
[1:57:07] everything comes perfectly together to
[1:57:10] fulfill the plan of God in order to
[1:57:13] bring us back to our rightful positions
[1:57:17] I'm not going any further let us pray

[1:57:22] morning and what an honor Lord to allow
