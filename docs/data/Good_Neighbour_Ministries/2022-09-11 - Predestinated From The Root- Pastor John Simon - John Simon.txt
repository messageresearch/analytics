great job and not job but a great service to the Lord giving him praise and honor and Glory every one of you thank you so much God bless you everyone I'm glad to be here today by the grace of God of course we've passed through a traumatic week our brother has gone on to be with the Lord uh but it's Emmanuel is across the river but he knows what's Happening Here and he's going to be praising and glorifying God and he's going to keep telling us now I'm finished my race but I I passed the Baton to you and you'd better run this race of life that is right in front of you you've got to carry it on by God's grace so we welcome all of you here uh this morning we welcome you sisters Lord bless your real God brothers in Christ you're welcome in the house of the Lord may God Comfort the heart of the family uh our sister Cecile in particular and give her a lift amen praise the Lord God bless all of you as we approach God's word here today we want to talk about being predestinated from the root predestinated from the root amen and uh this is just to get started Ephesians 3 17 to 19. praise the Lord Lord of God hallelujah have you got that up there okay praise the Lord okay let us read the word of God and it reads us that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you may be filled with all the fullness of God amen father we thank you for this the reading of your word now Lord we pray that you'll give to us uh some understanding that we might know you just a little better every day as we walk with you bless us together and lift us up in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen the Lord bless you real good please be seated hallelujah amen praise God God bless us all here today as we come together in his wonderful presence amen now um Ephesians says that we're being rooted and grounded praise the Lord rooted and grounded thanks be to God that we can be a part of that root and that we can be anchored in it we are anchored by that so we both rooted and grounded uh in the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen so I'm talking about being predestinated um from the very root we have not just um come lately in other words we are not just Christians that just arrive on the scene we were always believers because we were predestinated from sins in the mind of God from before the foundations of the world so we were in The Roots from the very beginning we were rooted then we were rooted in that and we are grounded by that because we were already in his mind so we can then relax and rest in him our Salvation is not of our works but Salvation is of the Lord it's the Lord's doing amen so he's telling you don't pay attention to all these things going around you and what's happening here this mistake you made the other mistake you may go put any emphasis on that keep your eyes on me because salvation is of the Lord Hallelujah pick up yourself dust off Press On Come True the blood has been already provided to wash your cleanse you present your faultless before the throne of grace you are not your own you're bought with a price you belong to him Hallelujah and he said not one that I have in my hand I'm going to not lose not one amen because they're in my hand and Satan can't take them out of my grass Hallelujah I'm so glad I serve a God Like That I'm not resting on my own will my own efforts my life Holiness my own attempts to achieve anything in Christ Hallelujah but all I know is to believe the word and rest in him because he said he will carry me home praise God and I thank God for that and I bless his holy wonderful name amen praise God hallelujah now we understand that uh Jesus is there or Jehovah Jesus is the original tree is that right and we were in the roots of that tree of course you know I I don't go to all of that but in the Garden of Eden the Tree of Life the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil whether Brandon clearly said Jesus was that tree he was the tree right so we understand then we were rooted or we were in that tree praise God now you've got to remember uh later on with brother Branham comes along and tells us that that tree went through the experience of a winter and in the winter the life from the tree goes right into the roots right and during the dark ages of the church the original life that was there on Earth then went in and through the Apostle and the original church and was working on functioning through the original Church Hallelujah he was set to do what restore the Bright Tree in other words to bring back that life on the scene again that the life might come back up amen from The Roots where the life hides in the winter every tree out there as you see with the green leaves they're gonna die or appear to die oh you see what really the life of the tree goes down into the roots and it stays there through the entire winter but when the sun comes up it rises again Hallelujah life comes back and it rises up again so during the Dark Ages the life went into the roots and it stayed there until the restoration of the bright tree and what does that life do the Life Starts to go back out find little branches and things to go into those branches to enable those branches to bear fruit because the vine doesn't bear fruit of itself it needs the branches to Bear the fruits he needs us he says I'm Divine it's you that are the branches and the branch is not to bring forth much fruit amen and we are here to produce fruit now when you say fruits be blood taken are the fruits of the spirit up there and like that which is only part of it but what fruit you are going look if I'm Apple if a tree you're passing in the forest or anywhere on the street and you look and you see a tree and it has apples on them them even crab apples or you pass and you see uh plums on them or something you say oh that's a plum tree yeah oh that's an apple tree the the fruit of the tree is the identification of what kind of a life is operating through that tree and the fruit the or his fruit on this tree of life when it comes up and it reproduces itself it starts to manifest just the original life that was in the roots from the very beginning of time and starts to manifest that and then you know it's an apple tree same thing with a Christian yeah you can make any claim you want you know but we'll see as we go along here amen that you be a real uh original tree that's been predestinated from The Roots praise the Lord amen no uh just to run through it quickly a few things here is first of all we know when we come to Cain and Abel we see a type or a symbol of a grafted tree and an original tree we see King and we see Abel Abel being the son of God and him being the son of the devil each representing something totally different but you see a bell was from the roots and because he was from The Roots when it came time uh for God to show certain things the word came to Abel not the king and okay airbel was able to know that it was blood because sin and he knew what sacrificed the offer listen there was no Bible written yet what does he know about the lamb what does he know about blood being going to be shared what does he know something was revealed to him and what was revealed to him was not written down on any paper or called the Bible or written we need the Bible That's what I'm saying but I'm telling you that the unwritten word was in existence before the written word and the operation of the Holy Spirit of bringing his thoughts to his Believers amen Still Remains the Same but we have a written word now in our day to compare it with to understand what we are receiving and what we have received from a prophet God said that God placed on the earth here so we thank God for that but Abel was an original seed son and look at Isaac Hallelujah you can see it plainly there when he says your wife Sarah is going to Bear a son then he tells not only is it she going to Bear her son she's gonna bury the Sun at this season now I don't that's another message you're gonna go off there with praise God the word comes in a season praise the Lord you see but then we know that he was born then when he was born it was impossible for Abraham and Sarah at their time of life a hundred years old and I think Sarah was 71 years and the five uh something like that oh my and impossible but then she wore the Sun which was the evidence that that sun was A Spoken Word season God displaying again the very same thing that should have been done in the gardener either but he's displaying it here in Abraham and in Sarah that by his spoken word sons and goddess can come on the scene just by the spoken word of God amen see so here was Isaac a spoken word seed son that came from the very root amen hallelujah then you can see Samuel you can see David you can see uh Jeremiah whom he told he said before you were even in your mother's womb I am God I knew you I knew you and I was the one that set you there is that right it's in the book of Jeremiah I sent you there and before you even came here I ordained you to be a prophet when you get down here you are going to be a prophet you're going to preach the word you're going to manifest the word hallelujah amen praise God so he told him that praise God and then we come right down to Jesus himself that he was the root amen foreign the same one that spoke to Sarah is now speaking to to Mary and said you're going to Bear a son and his name is going to be Jesus and the rest of it and you can go through the scriptures there's Paul and you see the relationship to the word it's always the relationship to the word amen of God working through them so it's very important for it us to recognize that we are in The Roots is that right I don't know about you but I know I am in the root I am rooted Hallelujah I'm not a Christian of today's kind of Christian but I am of the Ancient of Days Hallelujah ah this kind of Christianity is the one they had before the foundations of the world when the sons and God is of God's son shouted I rejoice in the presence of God and that's the same kind of religion or faith that we are practicing here today we're not practicing one that is done because of practice but or or because of discipline amen but we are doing something that is spontaneous something that just combustes it within your soul You Want To Praise Him you want to Magnify Him you want to glorify him because you are seeing something you personally are experiencing an individual revelation of God to your own heart I am not teaching out my television because the pastor told me to I am not tearing up this magazine over here I'm not saying that you shouldn't I'm just trying to make a point here okay so don't leave and say oh brother Simon said listen that which is totally perverted I am just saying we are no more which I did earlier but you see when you were a child you had to speak as a child you had to have your parents tell you oh don't do that don't do this don't do that don't go here watch what time you come home in the night Boy you know you have to have your parents do that at that time but when you be Paul said when you become a man you put away childish things it's all right what does that mean because now the Holy Spirit as James said we have a witness that is within us we have an inside teacher that teaches and guides us hallelujah we have the comforter who is with us he will both convict you of righteousness and show you have Holiness things to come but he will also Comfort your heart and point you back to the blood he will always be there with you Hallelujah that's why Paul said we are free in Christ and when you're free you don't look at who drinks coffee and who don't uh who keeps the new moon and and who keeps the full moon see because you are past that because God may make that one man um watch at the television see certain news hear certain things and you not one military life he will not allow you to do it but then you shouldn't go and turn and tell the other man because you don't know how God is using him so what you've got to do with that it's what Paul said that have compare themselves among themselves they're not wives you see each person has an individual revelation of God but all that has to line up with the world both front side and backside has got to line right up with the word and if your Revelation doesn't agree or light up with the word the prophet said in Christ is a mystery then you've got the wrong Revelation go back and check it with the words with the Holy Spirit and see what God is doing in and through your life amen glory to God God is wonderful isn't he praise the name of the Lord I'm so glad that he's the same Mighty God Amen praise God hallelujah amen now we know that that part of the word that we have to manifest in this age is not the foot it's not the the the the the knees is not the stomach you know I'm going through the building of his body that brother Branham spoke about Through the Ages he was building from the feet to you know the foundations and right up and then to the age where Wesley come with sanctification that partner cleanses the body cleanses itself and comes up to the speaking age where the Pentecostal is building his spiritual body and speaking tongues and everything else and then he says now he brought us now to the ceas where Prophet comes on the scene a Seer that can see the word manifest the word now praise God he says but now it's going beyond that but to the stage where there is no moving Parts amen it's going to break to the mind right right to the Mind Hallelujah but even when it goes to the Mind Adam lay on the ground with everything perfect but God still had to come and borrow the Breath of Life now we're back to life the life in there amen so now we understand clearly then that this age is not here to manifest gifts this Edge is not to manifest even brother branham's gift amen so it will have all of those things between the body right but it's not here to manifest not not just brother problems gift it's here now to the stage where the seed has come back to all the cycle and Back to the Sea Jesus over here one man with all the life in him gone in the ground rises again but when he comes back up he himself said it it would be the same one seed You're Gonna See it'll come up a thousandfold he's talking about a bright body he's talking about a many-membered body that his literal life that was back there in one man as now as it showed under their Pentecost it's gonna break itself up into little pieces pieces and it will be in thousands of Believers that trust his word and I will live in them they will walk with me and I'll be in them there will be my people and I will be their God God in Christ Christ in the church amen the kingdom being restored amen God restoring the kingdom once again for his glory amen hallelujah so it's your original life that was in Christ that will be manifested in each one of us you see but he don't look like like Jesus is supposed to or she doesn't act like you see brother Brandon said he is the great diamond and off of the diamond come all kinds of colors all kinds of colors amen what is that different uh um different lights of his person or personality none of us is going to reflect the whole thing because he is the only one that can reflect the whole thing but each one of us is going to have a part of his character and characteristic manifesting through US amen yes playing to the world that Christ is in you Christ is in me Christ is in every True Believer that trusts his word and believes it completely amen hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah now there's a wonderful sermon called works is Faith expressed and to read that will be a real blessing to read any of them will be a real blessing but I'm focused upon a little bit of this here today A little bit of that and a little bit in the anointed ones at the end time also we understand of course that God prepared good ground to receive his seed if you will read Matthew 7 15-20 you will see the parable of the sore and the different kinds of soil that the seed can fall into but now the possessed seed to come and fall into praise God that's why sometimes God preached the message prepared ground that you didn't just happen you were purposed and prepared by God and placed in this certain age to receive the word that is your purpose of being here when others rejected walk away from it get tired of it uh you know can't see it no more you can't have seen nothing else amen Jesus had over 500 disciples but then when he began to come down to his third pole and begin to make the world reveal manifest they said this is too much I I can't take this anymore it don't make sense the intellectuals get knocked out now say oh my and the Bible says in John chapter 6 and they all left him but then when we go to book of Acts chapter 2 it says 120 in the upper room that means 380 of them walk away from him but 120 was in the upper room is that right oh praise be to God my my see some were prepared ground and the others were not prepared to receive that and then what did they say he says do you also want to go away amen that's like a preacher that literally trying to preach the people out of his own church because Jesus said you want to go to if you want to go you can go to because now the whole thing gone right back to free moral agency you're free to come you're free to stay you're free to worship you're free to shout you're free to dance you're you're free to leave you're free to come amen that's not you can't really put anybody out of the real true Church of the Living God their eyes are not on you their eyes should be on the word there we go what is the word saying they go they said master um that was the words of eternal life uh where else we're going to go to hear this where else we gonna go to receive this oh my praise God you're in the desert there's only one water hole there's only one Oasis and you're gonna leave that and wander off hoping to find another one uh somewhere else and they said where are we going to go you the word of eternal life we can't leave the revealed work because we're seeing that we reckon recognize what we're seeing we know who we are we know what we are raised up for praise God for your original life that is within our hearts within our souls oh blessed be the name of the Living God hallelujah amen praise God Amen so the good ground prepared by God because he knows farming better than any farmer ain't no farmer is going to go out there and just take seed and throw them anywhere like that he wants to prepare the ground so that when that seed Falls he's assured that that's going to be a germanization there's going to something that'll come forth when that seed hits the ground with some moisture something is going to take place so he prepared the ground beforehand hallelujah amen and we know uh not to spend time on this but we know that the good ground that God prepared is the gene that he prepared a place to be there in you waiting for the red latter and former the word to come in in season and thank God we are receiving the Harvest rain we're receiving the going home ring we're receiving the rain to make you manifest what is in your Hallelujah you're not to work yourself up but when the rain falls on the seed the seed all the seed has to do is drink and grow drink and manifest drink and show forth drink and live amen that's all it's got to do look real believing Christianity is not hard it's not hard because if you cast your burdens on him he he will take care of it and he will take you through [Applause] so the word for each Edge coming in each Edge falls on the gene of the Believers that were predestinated for that age some to manifest only justification some to manifest only justification plus sanctification some to manifest just justification sanctification and Pentecostal experience right and there's another says that there were there they were prepared beforehand that when this message comes it will cause them to not they can manifest all those other things but that's not what they are supposed to manifest mainly what they are supposed to manifest and display to the world is that the original life that it was in the root has returned that life is here the power is here the presence of God Among Us Hallelujah the Cry of the king is within the camp amen I think the Bible said the shout of the king is in the camp so we praise God hallelujah that this is what we are here doing what we are supposed to do so I don't see a whole lot of gifts amongst them I don't see speaking in tongues amongst it's all here but the lonely manifest when God wants it to be made manifested it's no more us coming to try to do those things to bring self gratification and self-attention right no no no no no no no no matter of fact the brother Brown said they are going to want to live the hidden life they don't want to even be noticed yeah or anything like that but they can't help it when that manifests through them it'll catch people's attention but that's not them doing that that's him and that's when he receives all the glory unto him his self amen amen so we thank God that he prepared the ground for so that when the world would fall in an age the ground would already be prepared the gene will already be in the hearts of the believer listen Jesus was the flesh the father was the life or spirit is that right and he turned around and said oh the ground and the seed is really not two different things it's the same I am the father I want if you look at it you see that I am the father are what right Jesus and the father are one the ground and the scene is really one but we have to say it exactly how they said in the Bible here that you might recognize that the gene that was God allowed it and predestinated to be here amen so that when the word for the age comes there is a ready prepared ground for it to fall on it's all right praise God do you believe that and when the word falls upon that Gene or upon that life of that believer that was there waiting praise God and it strikes that what is that Gene going to produce the G or seed has to produce whatever tree it came from from back in the original so so all you see now is just an ordinary person you just see an ordinary seed but then the word falls on it but whatever that's that Gene that produces it comes back out and that is the life that identifies it of what origin it is from where it come from amen that it was a part of God from before the being it was in The Roots it was in God before the beginning but only now to be made manifest only now to be revealed to the rest of the world praise the name of the Lord hallelujah and that's why I thank God that he prepared the people beforehand to receive him to embody him that he could live in US temples of the Living God you believe you're a temple we are temples of the Living God oh my it doesn't matter what shape you have what color you have what uh height what the whatever God doesn't care about that but he prepared you as a temple amen and he wanted to know that there are these temples here waiting for him that when he comes he is able to fill them and use them and live in them and walk in them and manifest through them because they've been prepared ground prepared beforehand for his divine presence blessed be the name of the Lord God hallelujah amen so you'll find here in the uh what's his faith expressed he says now he says talking about this you can see predestination coming into Plain View that you can see what predestination is all about hallelujah amen praise God it's God showing to you his word and by showing to you his word he's also identifying to you you are predestinated you're my son you're my daughter you're my child because the word came to you the word always come to a predestinated vessel can't go nowhere else it only comes to the ones that were predestinated to hear it and to receive it only they can manifest the word of God only the spirit of God moving within their soul them to manifest the word of the Living God Amen yes sir amen hallelujah o praise God and when God reveals this word to you you don't have to go stammering about wondering if you're a Christian we're not wandering Stars we're not wandering this and wandering this and wandering over here and wandering over there and wondering about that no we are second of God and we can say I know that I know that I know that I know I I recognize who I am and what I came down here for Why God has me here on the scene amen praise God you know Daniel saw that and Daniel spoke about it he said he saw Thrones and uh and crowns cast down to the Earth and he said and the people in the last days those people that know their God they're amen they will be strong Hallelujah they'll do exploits amen because of knowing god knowing the word knowing who he is amen praise be to God hallelujah don't not give you confidence don't that give you confidence and give your strength to know who you are praise God hallelujah amen yes sir praise God oh my I'm so focused on things thank you brother for your kindness amen glory to God hallelujah amen hallelujah look we we are who God says we are [Music] it's not who people think you are or say you are we are who God says we are and we can do what God says we can do it he said I don't know if I'm going to be able to live this life I don't know if I'm going to be able to live that way or do this or do that amen praise God listen you can do what God says you can do because he knows you better than yourself he knows me better than myself amen when he came to Gideon he says Gideon you're going to be the deliverer foreign [Music] the angel just calls him out amen praise God but you see that is what it is the devil tried to cover up some of our lives with mud and Mock and all kinds of things uh cover it up so that people can't see the real you but but but they see all these things that may be associated with your life and it distracts them by looking at that and they don't see Christ in you working out his works of glory amen but God is calling every one of us to attention of his word amen praise God God is calling for us to get the spirit of Joshua and Caleb to be able to say no matter how Wicked this world is no matter how much chaos there is out there no matter what the system says we are able to go up and take the country we are able to live by this word we are able to take this mountain Hallelujah we can take it by the grace of God because the life that is in us has done it already and he can do it again and he lives in me praise God Hallelujah he lives in me and he lives in you praise God amen amen praise God Amen looking at Giants amen there's still a lot of people looking at the Giants and the message they're looking at the Giant's theological Giants or anything like that now if I wanted I could have taken that route but but I just walk away from all of that because once this word message got into my hand and I began to feel the pulsation of the Holy Spirit I didn't need to read a hundred books or hear a hundred messages the moment the first night uh that those two books drop into my hand I know right then that man is a prophet and whatever he says I'm going to believe it it wasn't just the written word of what he was saying but the atmosphere this hear it the anointing that was coming off of that word that I could fear maybe don't mean nothing to anybody else but to me I feel the impact of the Holy Spirit shaking my soul hallelujah amen it's almost like God sent you with a tuning fork when he sums up the word it it can strike that tuning fork and produce the exact sound they're told that he wants to produce amen hallelujah I tell you you don't have to worry about nothing once you catch this revelation of the word of God the word will do its own work in you yeah the word will clean you up the word will straighten you out the word will do everything that needs to be done if you surrender yourself to him the word of the Living God now brother Branham is about to speak about the grafted tree he talked about going to Arizona to uh a brother Charlotte and he says and while we were at this place I noticed he had a tree and the tree had about nine different kinds of fruits on it foreign how could this tree do that he said well it's an orange tree he said you see some of the branches are only bearing oranges because that's an uh oh uh orange branches but these are the branches I graphed them on when they were small and there is grapefruit there is tangelo and so on Citrus you're all citrus they are religious so so so I can graph them in so he grafted it in to the original orange tree now really you know that's speaking about Christ as the original Dream and anybody with a religious spirit they can be grafted into the tree but if they're grafted in it means you are not from the original life it means no matter how hard you try how many how many uh books you read how much studies you do you cannot produce your original life because you are not in the roots you work from The Roots amen you are coming now by your own efforts your own achievements your own Ambitions to be able to do that but you cannot do it because you're not from the roots amen oh my yes sir I'll just move on back to here to the court here he says the True Vine and the false Vine both have the same anointing upon them the rain falls in the just and the unjust doesn't matter if it's a weed or it's the real original he says both jumped and praised God because they were hot they were thirsty they were starving you know uh and the rain falls so what water had released both got released by the rain falling but that's not what's important what seed is in there what seed was hit back there amen but and then the rain comes as a lot of people thinks that when the baptism of the Holy Ghost come it doesn't come to bring you eternal life you have to have eternal life in you before I'm going that deep calls back to this deep that is in you amen the Deep closer deep under deeper response calls up to that Gene the voice of that Mighty Angel the Seventh Son of voice speaking truth Revelation in the heart of the believer or stick to that Gene what happened it manifests and come to life amen wow amen the truth sits together like a hand in a glove what you are hearing fits your soul fetch your being amen praise God you will recognize it amen hallelujah oh praise God when you get past all them things the devil trying to tell oh that man is just trying to convince you oh that guy is trying to persuade you look I don't have to persuade nobody I don't have to try to convince anybody of anything I am just here preaching the word and let the word Minister himself to every heart in here [Applause] praise the name of the Lord the True Vine and the false spine both have the same anointing but the water fell on both of them Hallelujah you see no wonder we it he said it would deceive the elected if it was possible if it was possible but we are not deceived why not because you're smarter Abraham wasn't smarter Abraham wasn't better than any of the rest of people there it's just that God called him out by Grace amen it's the same thing God placed a gene in you he placed part of himself in you we call that the attribute of God in you the seed of God in you a place in you amen before the foundation of the world you I repeat over again we are not creatures of time future home of the Heavenly Pride he says we come from eternity and we are going back to Eternity [Music] from God and I go back to God Hallelujah the way I'm I am the way the truth and the life amen the way you know praise God hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord now look at the word test of how they are going to prove where they're from let the word Holy Spirit fall on the word they claim to have in them and then watch them manifest an intellectual interpretation of the word instead of the original interpretation of the word the original manifestation of the world watch them produce a a practice tetraco Christian Life that reaches up to the nominational standards a Christian is supposed to be like this like this like this like this and you don't live up to that you don't live up to those standards you're not really a Christian right but the real Believers pointing you back to the word this is what you've got to look in the mirror here and see everything is all right you see praise the name of the Lord that your suit is not Twisted one side is that right that your tie is not skewed that your dress is not hanging why because you looked in the mirror praise God oh my that goes for every single one of us here praise the name of the Lord amen yeah they look the same and when you go into the church they're they're all Christians they look the same is that right what but by their fruits Jesus said You shall know them what they're bearing what they are manifesting by that you're going to know if they're of the word or if they're not of the world that doesn't mean you're going to become judgmental accusatory or anything of that nature but it's for you to recognize and once you recognize then you know how to act how to walk and how to talk by the grace of God Hallelujah by their Fruit by their life you're going to know them by what life they're manifesting amen hallelujah that fourth stage of the Bright Tree what is it the life bringing the tree back to life bring the tree back to life amen so we are in that stage here right now amen when that tree that's planted by the rivers of Living Waters it is coming to life and has come to life again by the grace of God hallelujah manifest they're manifesting something but they're not manifesting the life that was in the root from the original in the beginning it was not so we've got to come back to that original life living through us not us trying to go out there and say oh brother random preacher and the statue of a perfect man I gotta have faith I gotta have virtue I gotta have knowledge oh my goodness it's all in you because if the Lord Jesus Christ lives in you he is all perfection but now you've got to live it out or manifest it as I've always said or work out your salvation or manifest whatever as you say you're saved but you got to make it manifest so that people will know about the grace of God hallelujah amen now how do you know what it is that it isn't an orange amen because when you look at that branch the branch is bearing a grapefruit even though it's also in the Vine it's hanging from the same tree it's claiming to be a Christian but watch the life that is manifesting through that Veil that vessel that you can discern and know what kind of a life is back there hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord amen and there's a lot of people in this message that making all kinds of claim and but that life when you look at it the life is not in the world life is full of tricks in other words that life that is manifesting through them could be a life that's full of scheming a life full of trickery a life full of being proud of being smart and I don't mean Smart in the sense of smart of knowledge and knowing the things of how to go through life that's not the smart I'm taught I'm talking about the evil devilish coming of the of Satan working through them Amen in such a way my friend the life manifested is not from the war the real orange the life comes from the roots for it was predestinated from The Roots amen praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen praise God I'm in the bride amen anybody can claim that you see anybody can claim that that's become a just a another word I'm in the bride I'm in the message I believe the prophet I believe all the prophets men I go to sleep listening to the prophet I I fast I pray whatever you see that's wonderful and we should do that but that's not what it is what is the life that's being produced by the Revelation that is within your heart and that proves what it is back there amen because we are not going by that we are here and all we're doing at every minute we're listening to the voice of God we're listening for the seven Thunders to speak amen that Mighty Angel to make known to us his Divine Wills praise the name of the Lord I'm going to start bringing this to a close up here praise God Amen I know I'm giving you uh enough for the word and more to come but uh you we're living in physical bodies and we have to respect and recognize that also amen praise the name of the Lord Jesus now it's bearing grapefruit fruit it isn't like the first one and if a church says they believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today forever and uh then we'll find out it will then have the of the life of Jesus Christ but no matter if the life is pouring into it if it is not predestinated from the roots it will bear nothing but grapefruit you see if that original life is not pouring in amen into there and falling on that good ground that was prepared beforehand it can only produce grapefruit amen hallelujah amen so he prepared you and I so that the seed word of God could fall on some good ground because there's all kinds of soil out there rocky soil uh thorns and thistles on the ground and and so on and he prepared us particularly to be fertile ground to receive the word of God forever Hallelujah and the reason for that is so that the seed could have a chance to reproduce itself let me stop there because now there's another thought going off there you see how could the seed go into the ground supposedly to manifest itself reproduce itself but it comes back up manifesting a grapefruit you can't do it then it proves to you that that was not the original it was not the original scene that went into the ground praise God but I'm glad that when the word fell on me amen It produced the original life It produced Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord hallelujah you say brother Simon um I'm thankful for the word of God but uh what is it doing for me it's letting you know yourself just letting you know who you are you're getting more authority of knowing the power of a predestinated seat that was predestinated from the roots that you don't need to be shaky and wondering Paul puts it this way he said now even if your own heart starts to condemn you God is greater than your heart [Music] the word says Who You Are doesn't matter anymore it's you're too late now you can't turn back this has started from since before the foundation of the world and you're not going to go now and and what can you do to that I'm glad let the musicians come I'm so glad that I'm a part of God's whole plan of what he's doing in this day and in this time and I give him praise and honor and glory amen predestinated from the root just think upon it during the rest of the week going to the into those wonderful sermons works as Faith Express also go into the anointed ones at the end time and see now that when you say I'm growing in faith amen it doesn't mean that you're you you're getting more faith than you ever had it just means you're getting more enlightened and that is causing you to see the world and believe more of the word because you're being enlightened amen praise the Lord and we thank God for that that will walk in the light let's sing that one we'll walk in the light such a beauty a light walk where the Dew drops [Applause] [Music] it is Jesus [Music] one more time [Music] the light such a beautiful life [Music] [Music] my eyes Jesus [Music] oh he's wonderful isn't he praise the Lord God bless your Saints keep pressing on walking in the light and Lord just make me more make me all that I'm supposed to be and all I can be and just live your life be yourself don't compare yourself with some other Christian just be who you are in Christ is that right that's what God wants you to be he wants me to be a preacher he wants this one to be a housewife he wants the other one to be a factory worker he wants the other one to be a musician he wants this God does his own work let go and let God have his wonderful way and relaxing in him and enjoy your life in him and let Christ work and move in your hearts by faith amen or but it pains your heart when you see the Believers who claim to Believers their lives tied up Shackled and bound by legalisms of this message traditions tied up by all these things in the world and they're not free but thank God whom the son sets free is free indeed hallelujah praise God God bless you brother [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I've got the life [Music] [Music] of what it is [Applause] I don't know I've got the life [Music] it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble it's the life behind an egg that makes us [Music] it's the life behind me [Music] all these eyes [Music] fix them [Music] [Applause] one more time [Music] behind me [Music] you know [Music] we have a wonderful week you are dismissed this morning amen oh glorious Victory like they said it's very true my life is no longer time [Music] [Music] getting up here [Applause] [Music] [Music] I can see [Music] [Applause] Revelations Jesus
