[0:36] just that you might know we haven't we
[0:39] have not
[0:39] come together here for me to preach the
[0:44] word of god as such but we
[0:47] are here gathered in his name
[0:51] and by his divine order
[0:54] that we should have the lord's supper
[0:58] and we should come together and do this
[1:02] according to his plan and his
[1:06] command and we thank him for his
[1:09] precious words
[1:10] all praises wonderful name of course
[1:14] friends i want to uh just
[1:17] also remind you that this
[1:21] wednesday uh we are
[1:24] going to continue in
[1:27] our teaching on the seven church
[1:30] ages it will be lesson
[1:34] 41 and our topic will be
[1:39] is hell eternal
[1:43] let me repeat my topic will be
[1:46] is hell really eternal
[1:51] may god help us as we look into that
[1:54] subject
[1:55] this coming wednesday night
[2:00] at 7 30
[2:03] may the lord bless you real good
[2:07] the following sunday or the sunday
[2:10] following
[2:12] we will be back speaking on the topic
[2:17] of the place where god put his name that
[2:22] will be part two of the place
[2:26] where god put his name
[2:30] and i believe we we will be really
[2:33] blessed
[2:34] as we open our hearts to receive
[2:37] the word of god that was given to us
[2:42] but as i've said before we are gutted
[2:44] here tonight
[2:45] my friends to bless his holy name
[2:50] to give him glory and honor
[2:54] we are here to take the lord's supper
[2:58] we are here to celebrate his life
[3:03] we are here to remember him
[3:06] and his words we are here
[3:10] to worship and lift up his mighty name
[3:15] now of course the apostle paul
[3:19] reminds us in the word of god
[3:23] that we should take communion
[3:27] and that we should take it together
[3:30] because of his command
[3:35] his sacred order or ordinance
[3:38] that he has left us with two ordinances
[3:42] water baptism and the lord
[3:46] supper called also
[3:49] communion and so my brothers we thank
[3:54] the lord
[3:55] for these two ordinances
[3:59] to remember how that he poured out
[4:02] his life as a substitute
[4:06] for our lives glory to god
[4:10] and how he poured out his blood
[4:13] to wash up wash us away from our sins
[4:19] oh precious is the flow
[4:22] that makes me white as snow
[4:25] no other fount i know nothing
[4:28] but the blood of jesus thank god
[4:31] the dying thief rejoiced to see
[4:35] that fountain in his day and now
[4:39] hear me i though while as he
[4:43] come to this table come
[4:46] into his presence and wash all
[4:50] my sins away thank god
[4:54] now we know that uh communion
[4:57] is a symbol it's symbolic
[5:01] and we understand the symbolic
[5:05] symbolism of what it is
[5:09] and he left it for us
[5:13] as a reminder to remind us
[5:17] of what he had done for us
[5:21] his glorious sacrifice
[5:25] that he made for us
[5:28] but this
[5:31] communion holds power
[5:35] not only as a symbol
[5:38] but as i said as a reminder
[5:42] that we should also invite
[5:45] the holy spirit of the living god
[5:49] to infuse us to indwell us
[5:52] to control us to lead us to guide us
[5:56] to teach us and bring us into
[5:59] all truth and show us
[6:02] things to come are
[6:05] we must invite the holy spirit
[6:09] that he might come especially
[6:12] at this time to examine our lives
[6:17] to go through our lives
[6:21] make up an accounting
[6:25] of the acts the deeds the
[6:28] thoughts the motives the motivations
[6:32] and that the great holy spirit of the
[6:35] living god
[6:36] will come to us and speak to us
[6:41] as his dear children and continue
[6:45] his work of constantly and consistently
[6:51] washing us by
[6:54] and through the endless
[6:57] marvelous grace of our lord jesus christ
[7:02] i am so thankful i'm so happy that we
[7:05] could be here tonight
[7:08] to celebrate and to magnify the great
[7:12] name
[7:13] of the lord jesus christ for the great
[7:16] work that he has done let us pray
[7:21] our gracious god and heavenly father

[7:29] that we could draw nigh to you
[7:32] by the way of prayer and through the
[7:34] precious blood of christ

[8:30] blood and the bread which represents
[8:34] your broken body
[8:37] to commemorate the great act
[8:41] that you have done oh thou
[8:44] dying lamb thy precious blood shall
[8:47] never lose its power till all the ransom
[8:51] church of god are saved to sin no more
[8:56] father today we give all the praise
[8:59] the honor and the glory in jesus
[9:02] name amen and amen
[9:07] now i'd like to read out of the book of
[9:09] acts
[9:10] let us turn in our bibles to
[9:13] acts chapter 2
[9:17] and we will read from verse 41.
[9:22] of course acts chapter 2 speaks of the
[9:25] coming of the holy spirit
[9:28] coming upon the believers on the day of
[9:32] pentecost
[9:34] and after the great question was asked
[9:38] men and brethren what mean it this
[9:42] and the bible tells us that peter
[9:45] stood up and he proceeded to
[9:49] answer the question and he said
[9:52] this is that
[9:55] this is the fulfillment
[9:59] of joel's prophecy how that god
[10:02] promised that he would pour out of his
[10:06] spirit
[10:07] upon all flesh all flesh with no
[10:10] partiality
[10:11] but only of course we know
[10:14] only the elected of god only the seed
[10:18] the germ the children of god the
[10:21] attributes of god
[10:24] would come into a new birth
[10:28] by the falling of that refreshing holy
[10:31] spirit
[10:32] soul cleansing rain amen
[10:36] and so that the great holy spirit
[10:40] peter was speaking of peter said
[10:43] this is that spoken of
[10:47] by the prophet joel we have received it
[10:52] and as he proceeded to preach the word
[10:54] and tell them of the end of
[10:57] pillars of fire and vapors of smoke
[11:00] coming of the lord
[11:01] they screamed out men and brethren
[11:05] what shall we do to be saved
[11:08] and he continued repent be baptized
[11:12] in the name of jesus christ hallelujah
[11:16] oh my and you will receive this also
[11:20] for it is unto you unto your children
[11:22] unto your children's children
[11:24] and as many as the lord our god
[11:29] amen shall call thanks be to god
[11:32] hallelujah now let's speak up our
[11:35] scripture
[11:38] then they that gladly
[11:41] received his word were baptized
[11:46] and the same day they were
[11:49] added unto them about three
[11:53] thousand souls they did not wait to have
[11:56] catechisms talk to them
[11:58] they did not wait to have fundamentals
[12:01] given to them they did not wait for
[12:05] some litany to be given to them
[12:08] but the bible tells us the same day
[12:12] that they heard the word it set
[12:15] their soul of fire with the spirit of
[12:18] god
[12:20] and the same day they wanted to be
[12:23] baptized in water in the name of jesus
[12:26] christ
[12:28] hallelujah amen and the same day
[12:34] there were added unto them about 3
[12:38] 000 souls and they
[12:41] continued in the apostles doctrine
[12:44] and fellowship and
[12:48] watch this listen and in communion
[12:52] and in the breaking of bread and in
[12:55] prayers
[12:56] hallelujah and fear
[12:59] that's holy reverential fear
[13:03] came upon every soul
[13:06] and many wonders and signs
[13:10] were done by the apostles
[13:13] and all that believed were together
[13:17] and had all things common
[13:22] and sold their possessions and
[13:25] goods and parted them to all men
[13:30] as every man had need
[13:33] and they continuing
[13:36] daily with one accord
[13:40] in the temple and breaking
[13:44] of bread from house to house
[13:49] did eat there meet with gladness and
[13:52] singleness of heart
[13:54] praising god and having favor
[13:58] with all the people and the lord added
[14:02] to the church
[14:04] such as should be saved
[14:08] o blessed be his holy precious
[14:11] and wonderful name amen
[14:14] glory to god hallelujah praise his
[14:18] wonderful name now friends we know
[14:23] most folk believe that the lord's supper
[14:27] or communion ought to be taken in a
[14:30] church
[14:32] or at church and it's wonderful
[14:35] if we could be in this time in our
[14:39] various churches
[14:41] and having the lord's supper together
[14:44] with our brethren uh this great
[14:48] agape meal this love
[14:51] feast of the great holy spirit
[14:54] all greeting each allah praying
[14:58] praising celebrating glorifying
[15:01] with great exhilaration joy
[15:05] thrills and triumph of the holy spirit
[15:09] within our hearts however
[15:12] because of this covet virus
[15:16] that we are all experiencing
[15:20] around the world the various
[15:23] lockdowns and step home orders
[15:28] we have been hindered
[15:32] from coming together in large groups
[15:37] we have been hindered in worshipping
[15:42] together as we we should
[15:45] but of course the bible is a balanced
[15:48] healthy book it tells us to obey
[15:52] the higher powers any
[15:55] genuine true christian will
[15:59] listen to what the word of god says
[16:02] when it tells us even when we don't
[16:05] understand
[16:06] obey those that are above you
[16:10] whether that ruler king or
[16:13] or a governor is it
[16:17] is one that brings terror to your heart
[16:21] yet the bible tells us obey
[16:25] the higher powers of course that means
[16:29] as long as they don't
[16:30] take you away from god in the fact of
[16:33] stopping you
[16:34] from praising praying worshiping giving
[16:36] him glory
[16:37] other than that we are to render unto
[16:41] caesar
[16:42] what is caesar's and unto god
[16:45] that which belongs to god oh praise
[16:49] god's
[16:50] name so when the bible is properly
[16:52] understood
[16:53] it's a balanced book that points you
[16:57] to the truth and so here we find
[17:01] ourselves
[17:03] in this chaotic times
[17:06] in this perilous time as prophesied
[17:10] by the bible oh we find ourselves
[17:14] when troublesome times are here filling
[17:18] man's hearts with fear
[17:20] but freedom we all hold there
[17:23] now is at stake so what should we do
[17:27] humble your heart to god and
[17:30] ask him plead to him cry out to him
[17:35] o praise his name but subject and submit
[17:39] yourself
[17:40] to the higher powers and allow god
[17:43] to do the rest do what you can
[17:47] and then stand hallelujah do your best
[17:51] then let god do the rest let the holy
[17:54] spirit
[17:55] go to work we we we hardly give
[17:59] god the chance to work
[18:02] miracles in our lives because we
[18:05] are trying to work it out by our human
[18:08] wisdom and knowledge we are trying to
[18:12] solve
[18:13] every problem by our own strength our
[18:17] own abilities our own intelligence
[18:20] rather than surrendering it all to him
[18:24] and asking him for his divine help
[18:28] casting our cares upon him and letting
[18:31] him care for us oh
[18:34] praise god my brother my sister
[18:39] nevertheless in the midst of the plagues
[18:43] of egypt
[18:45] israel still had the passover
[18:51] in the midst of all the
[18:54] tracks and trails of the
[18:57] king esther
[19:01] down there in syria
[19:05] still had part time
[19:09] when they had the lord's
[19:12] supper i would call it that it wasn't
[19:15] called that then
[19:16] but my god she said i'm going to see the
[19:21] king
[19:22] doesn't matter what opposition is in my
[19:25] way
[19:25] i'm going to see the king we are
[19:29] presented
[19:31] my friends with these troubles trials
[19:36] and viruses which are everywhere
[19:41] but our faith and our trust is in the
[19:44] true
[19:44] and in the living god but thank god
[19:49] we are not only to have communion
[19:53] in a church building for we have read in
[19:56] our own bibles
[19:58] that after they were baptized
[20:02] they had meals together they act
[20:04] together
[20:05] they had marvelous times together but it
[20:08] also tells us
[20:10] that they went from house to house with
[20:13] the breaking
[20:14] of bread hallelujah
[20:17] oh my they had the lord's supper
[20:22] oh and with prayers seeking god
[20:27] and uniting their hearts together
[20:31] glorifying him so that their lives
[20:35] may manifest his
[20:38] word his written word
[20:42] as the living word living
[20:45] through them bringing glory and honor
[20:49] to his great almighty name
[20:52] and too glad that we are here today
[20:56] and that he lives forevermore for he
[21:00] lives in me
[21:01] he lives in you and together we are the
[21:04] sons and daughters
[21:06] of the living god in this present
[21:09] day and in the midst of this evil age
[21:12] hallelujah
[21:13] and we are proving to the world
[21:16] that we can still live godly
[21:19] in the midst of babylon we are
[21:22] proving to god that we can live
[21:26] pure pure in the midst of babylon
[21:30] like danielle like the four three boys
[21:34] with him we can live according to
[21:37] this word this bible we can trust him
[21:42] for he said his words will never ever
[21:45] fail
[21:47] hallelujah your taking the lord's supper
[21:52] is a real blessing and i'm blessed
[21:55] whenever
[21:56] i take the lord's supper because
[21:59] it's a powerful time it's a holy
[22:03] spirit time it's a jesus time
[22:07] it's a time when anything can happen
[22:10] all glory be to god a powerful time
[22:15] that we can spend with the lord
[22:19] hallelujah jesus said
[22:22] as often as you do this
[22:25] praise god hallelujah so he
[22:28] is encouraging us to remember
[22:32] him as often as possible
[22:36] or and by having to actively participate
[22:41] in this glorious wonderful
[22:45] event or ordinance it reminds us
[22:50] of what he has done for
[22:53] us thank god for his divine
[22:57] implementation of this ordinance
[23:01] that we might remember him oh
[23:05] aren't we not to remember him we must
[23:08] always remember him at the right times
[23:12] remember him when your days are
[23:15] dark and dismal remember him
[23:19] when you have the happy wonderful days
[23:23] remember him when you are young
[23:26] and strong but remember also your
[23:30] creator
[23:31] as the scripture said in the days of
[23:33] your youth
[23:35] for when the evil days come hallelujah
[23:38] and the years draw nigh that you become
[23:41] old
[23:42] remember jesus my friends
[23:45] remember him when you have no money in
[23:48] your pocket
[23:50] remember him or when you maybe have
[23:53] a lot of money still remember him
[23:56] remember him
[23:57] when you don't have a job remember him
[24:00] when you do have a job
[24:02] remember him in every situation
[24:06] remember jesus because
[24:09] of what he has done for us
[24:14] now how are we supposed to take the
[24:17] lord's supper
[24:19] first of all in the scriptures
[24:22] paul said let a man
[24:26] examine himself first of all you should
[24:29] make your heart
[24:30] right with god as we are here now we
[24:33] we're about to take the lord's supper
[24:35] while i'm yet speaking to you start
[24:37] talking in your heart to yourself amen
[24:41] and make your heart right with god
[24:46] because communion
[24:50] genuine holy ghost communion
[24:54] administered by an anointed servant
[24:57] of the risen christ can heal you
[25:02] right now wherever you are
[25:06] it can heal you or
[25:09] in disobedience in rebellion
[25:14] and refusal to repent it can
[25:17] also kill you let me repeat
[25:21] genuine communion can
[25:24] heal you while you're taking it
[25:27] while you're listening to it or it
[25:31] can kill you amen so
[25:34] while i'm yet speaking the word if
[25:36] you're sick
[25:38] receive your healing say oh
[25:41] lord may i receive my healing now
[25:45] i claim my deliverance now i
[25:48] claim my miracle now i claim
[25:52] a touch just to have one touch from you
[25:55] lord
[25:56] may my faith touch the hem of your
[25:58] garment
[25:59] and i know i know it will make me whole
[26:04] put your faith in him right now my
[26:06] friends
[26:07] and he will make you whole amen
[26:10] praise god listen to what paul said
[26:15] in the very word of god
[26:19] for i have received of the lord
[26:22] that which also i delivered unto you
[26:27] that the lord jesus the same night in
[26:29] which he was betrayed
[26:31] took bread and when he had given
[26:35] thanks he'd break it and said
[26:39] take eat this is
[26:43] my body which is broken for you
[26:47] this do in remembrance of me
[26:51] and after the same manner also
[26:54] he took the cup and when he had stopped
[26:58] saying this cup is the new testament
[27:03] in my blood this do ye
[27:06] as often as you drink it
[27:09] in remembrance of me
[27:13] for as often as you eat this bread and
[27:15] drink this cup
[27:16] you do sure the lord's death till he
[27:19] come
[27:20] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[27:23] and drink this
[27:24] cup of the lord unworthily shall be
[27:27] guilty
[27:28] of the body and blood of the lord
[27:31] but let a man woman examine themselves
[27:35] and so let them eat of that bread and
[27:38] drink of that cup for he
[27:42] or she that eat it and drink it
[27:44] unworthily
[27:46] ease it and drink it damnation
[27:49] to themselves not discerning the lord's
[27:53] body
[27:55] for this cause many are weak
[28:00] and sick or sickly among you
[28:04] and many are dead or asleep
[28:07] for if we should judge ourselves
[28:10] we should not be judged
[28:14] amen wherefore my brethren when you come
[28:17] together to eat
[28:19] wait tarry one for another and if any
[28:22] man hunger let him eat at home
[28:25] that you come to come not together onto
[28:29] condemnation and the rest will i
[28:33] set in order when i
[28:37] come amen
[28:40] hallelujah now in this scripture paul
[28:44] was writing to a people whose hearts was
[28:47] were not really right with god
[28:51] they were taking the lord's supper
[28:54] and they were taking it when they were
[28:56] hungry
[28:58] and so that caused them to
[29:01] eat the bread and to begin
[29:06] drinking the wine as if
[29:10] they were at a buffet
[29:13] and not with true
[29:17] reverence and remembrance
[29:21] of the lord jesus christ himself
[29:24] therefore paul rebuked them
[29:28] and then he urged them when you come
[29:31] together for the lord's supper
[29:33] the first thing you ought to do is to
[29:36] examine yourself before partaking
[29:41] may we examine ourselves while
[29:45] we are still in the process of this
[29:47] service here today
[29:50] may we search our own hearts
[29:54] may we act as paul said
[29:58] soberly let us come
[30:02] decently let us come righteously
[30:06] and reverently and not into god's
[30:09] presence
[30:10] boisterously but come
[30:14] with the sacredness as
[30:17] this ordinance
[30:21] requires of us
[30:24] and we ought to come that way
[30:29] we must eat at our homes make sure you
[30:32] you you take the lord's supper not when
[30:34] you're hungry
[30:36] so you want a large piece of the bread
[30:40] and
[30:40] you want a great cup of the wine
[30:44] but to come with order come with
[30:48] reverence sacredness
[30:51] in the house of the lord
[30:56] and i believe we ought to listen to this
[30:58] and obey this
[31:00] because as paul said there are
[31:03] consequences
[31:05] serious consequences
[31:09] for taking this bread and this wine
[31:13] as if you were at a buffet
[31:16] are at some normal persons
[31:20] dining table we are here to take not
[31:24] man supper but we are here to partake
[31:28] of the lord's supper
[31:33] now you say well rather simon
[31:36] paul said let a man a woman a person
[31:40] examine themselves how do we examine
[31:42] ourselves
[31:44] well first of all stop and pray
[31:50] stop and pray begin to examine your own
[31:55] heart
[31:58] in the quietness of your heart
[32:02] with the inner peace of god
[32:06] with the stillness of the holy spirit
[32:10] blessed quietness holy quietness
[32:14] oh may the great holy spirit
[32:17] speak to your heart to your need to your
[32:20] desire
[32:22] as you pray to god
[32:26] and in praying begin to ask god
[32:31] to reveal to you
[32:34] if you have any unconfessed sins
[32:38] within your life you might have even
[32:41] forgot
[32:42] you might not have thought of it or you
[32:45] might have thought it was not sin
[32:48] you didn't even know it was wrong but
[32:50] ask the holy spirit
[32:53] to remind you and reveal to you
[32:56] so that you may confess your sins and
[32:59] your
[33:00] faults your mistakes in the presence
[33:04] of the living god as the apostle peter
[33:06] said
[33:07] repent and be baptized
[33:10] in the name of jesus christ not in the
[33:14] name of father son and holy ghost
[33:16] for father son and holy ghost are not
[33:18] even names they're only titles
[33:20] it's one name and peter knew that so he
[33:23] didn't repeat the
[33:24] just repeat the words of jesus over the
[33:27] person
[33:27] he said repent be baptized
[33:31] in the name of jesus christ and you
[33:34] shall receive
[33:35] the gift of the holy ghost for this is
[33:38] the promise hallelujah
[33:39] thank god forevermore and this that
[33:43] promise
[33:44] is still in force it is still in power
[33:46] today
[33:47] as we surrender our hearts and lives to
[33:50] him
[33:52] ask the lord to cleanse you
[33:57] with his precious blood
[34:01] ask the holy spirit ask god
[34:04] for refreshing infilling of his blessed
[34:08] holy spirit
[34:09] to come to your life
[34:12] oh praise god i remember
[34:16] an old song that says something like
[34:20] when i think about the cross
[34:24] where my savior had to die
[34:27] when i think about the cross where
[34:30] my savior had to die oh
