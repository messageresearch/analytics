But but the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin, all unbelief. So we can lift up holy hands. We can come before the throne of God boldly. We have a right to be here because of the lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world.

Let him just be a vessel that will speak the word and the word only because as the brothers always say when they pray, we're not interested in man's opinion. And that's true, Lord. This is not a day for man's opinion. It's a day for the pure word of God. May you flow through your servant, the Father. Use the gift.

Welcome into the house of the Lord this evening. Amen. You've come with expectation in your hearts. I believe you'll leave rejoicing. Amen. Uh tonight, I'd like to uh bring a a prayer request. A good friend of mine, Tony, and his wife, Rose, are asking for prayer for their daughter, Tanya. She's going for a special procedure tomorrow. Um, they've they've been um they've got their first child. They'd like to have a second child. And so, they're going for a procedure tomorrow, and they're asking for prayer. And so, we will take that before the Lord tonight and uh leave it in the hands of the Lord. Amen. and then we'll invite our precious brother to come and minister the word of God. Let's all bow our heads in prayer. Great Jehovah God, creator of heaven and earth, the giver of life of all things. Lord, that only by you does anything exist. And we are so grateful for that tonight, Lord, that we are coming to the one and only creator, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And Father, we bring this request for Tanya, Lord, the daughter of Tony and Rose Kella, uh lovely people, Father, that have been so good to us and kind. And Lord, they're just asking for a special prayer for their daughter. And Lord, we're asking you, great Jehovah God, to take control. And Lord, if it is in your will, we pray that your desire, it would be fulfilled in her life and in her husband, Stefan. Father, that you would visit them, Lord, and give them a child. Granted, Father, we love you. We appreciate you. We know that you're the giver of life. And so we give you thanks and praise. And now as we go into this aspect of the service, may you take your servant once again. Lord, move him aside and let your spirit just come and speak to our hearts. And Lord, you know the needs of your people. Lord, your word was sent to heal the people. May you heal hearts tonight. those that would that would listen in online, Father, may your anointing move and may there be no distance and no time, Lord, between each and every heart and every need, Father. Meet the needs granted, Father, we give you thanks in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. God bless you, Brother Tim. Come and have your liberty. Thank you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; God bless you, saints. Amen. It's good to be here tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're happy to be here tonight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You can be seated. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Good to be in the house of the Lord tonight. Well, you know, a good preacher, they said, um, preaches 80% everything over and over and over again. I think it's because that it takes time for us for it to sink down deep. God knows that. So, we got to preach it over and over and over. But the other 20% has nothing to do with the preacher. Amen. It's between you and the Lord. Amen. And that's what we really want to receive tonight. We've always this this I I believe this message from a prophet broke us into another dimension and we've been hearing about the the the dimensions, right? Speaking in tongues or something and um we've been hearing about it, right? And we know that it's here, but we also know that he's here. And that's how that's who we don't get in contact with him. Amen. We don't hear his voice. &gt;&gt; You can hear my voice and you can hear 80% tonight and walk out of here without hearing his voice. It brings no life, no change. Amen. Hallelujah. So we gather here together not because of titles, not even because of gifts, though God uses them, but we gather here to come into his presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To hear his voice. If you haven't prayed like you should have prayed and got in contact with him, then do it now. Amen. So that he can speak to your heart. Because if you rely on preachers and and you know, you might just be disappointed. &gt;&gt; I rely on I rely on him to speak from that other dimension to your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. this voice translating the still small voice. That's what brings life. That's what brings change. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, let us turn to the word tonight. I'm going to start a couple parts series here, right? Uh about um the title tonight is my bride hears my voice and a strange voice she will not follow. Mhm. &gt;&gt; It's impossible for her to follow a strange voice in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz all she hears is his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we want to lay a little foundation tonight. And then the next part we want to get into where is the voice of God in this day. There's a lot of confusion with that. Where the voice of God is in this hour, in this day. Some say it's just in the tapes. Some say it's just in certain anointed men, certain gifts. I don't believe that. Or just in the five-fold ministry. No, I don't believe that. We're going to take the next service and and bring out what the prophet said, what the word says, where his his voice is in this hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is an hour of recognizing who we are. &gt;&gt; That's it, brother. &gt;&gt; If if there's never been an hour, that's the rapture. That's the quickening power &gt;&gt; in us to realize who we are in this hour and who he is. &gt;&gt; There's a consciousness coming, &gt;&gt; an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; You want to call it the other dimension of the rapture. Amen. Our theophony is closing in. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that's it. It's it's it's it's a late hour. It's a late hour to be messing around. And let me tell you, Satan is fighting. &gt;&gt; Leoian spirit, lukewarm, lazy, powerless, a Christian formal life. &gt;&gt; He's fighting in this hour. He's fighting right in the message. &gt;&gt; I I've been preaching it. We've been preaching it here for many years, but my last series, the denominational spirit. A lot of people that want to believe it. Ah, it's not in the message. &gt;&gt; Watch out. &gt;&gt; It's not here. traditions and all these things, culture, separation, all these stuff. It's here. &gt;&gt; It's here. Man's interpretations is here. &gt;&gt; But also the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The little bride is here. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And one man, one little bride with God is the majority. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh my. don't take a lot when she raises up in the same created spoken power word of God inside of her and she comes to that place where God is going to bring her and is bringing her where she'll speak the word of God. She's speaking the word of God now, but there's prophecies that is coming when she speaks in that time. It'll be God himself. Amen. John 10:27. Hallelujah. Simple scriptures, but may God quicken the word to us tonight. You pray for me as I preach that I get out of the way. My sheep hear my voice and I know them. Listen to his words. And they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish. Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. Oh, hallelujah. Amen. I started rejoicing reading that scripture. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; It's just wonderful. Amen. I hear the voice of my beloved speaking to me. &gt;&gt; Oh, every day I hear his voice. Amen. Hallelujah. Let's turn to Hebrews 4:7. The voice of God is always misinterpreted. Jesus Christ will never interpret his own voice. Jesus Christ will interpret his own voice. Sorry. Jesus said, "My sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow." Hebrews 7:47 again he limit a certain day saying in David today after so long a time as it is said today if ye will hear his voice the word the revelation now you can't do it &gt;&gt; he's not he's not proclaiming that &gt;&gt; for you to do it. You can't do it. But if he gives you grace, an election to hear his voice, his word, the revelation, harden not your hearts. There are so many things in this life as Paul said, endure hardness as a good soldier. We are being tested on every side, every angle. the bride of Jesus Christ, Satan is throwing everything on her to try to harden her heart. And when a heart gets hardened, they can't hear the voice of God. For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he have not afterwards have spoken of another day, there remainth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works. And God as God did from his. Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief. For the word of God, and the word of God is the voice of God, is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even and dividing a sunder of soul and spirit. You see what the voice of God does? This is what the voice of God does to an individual when you hear his voice. and the joints and the marrows and the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Out of his mouth went the sharp two-edged sword which is the word of God. Amen. Let's pray. Father, thank you Lord tonight that we are gathered together by faith. Lord, nothing pleases you but faith. Lord, let there be faith raised up. Let us go higher tonight, Lord. There is no great person here but you, Father. And your lovely bride loves you tonight, Lord. Speak to our hearts. We're talking on the voice of God. No man could interpret it, Lord. Come and interpret your own word, your own voice, by manifesting it. That's the way you've always done it, Lord. You've always interpret your word by manifesting it, Father. And that's what the bride has the ability in this hour, Lord. that has been given to her through the Holy Ghost to see this word manifested, Father, and you moving in our midst and manifest in yourself. Grant these things, Father. Take control. Pour out your spirit as you promised upon all flesh here and online. Take control of your servant. Take control of the hearer. In Jesus name we ask. Amen. God bless you as you're seated. Like I said, we're going to be laying a foundation um down and I forgot my uh drink and it's on your desk there. Thank you, pastor. Lay, like I said, laid a foundation, but let the Holy Spirit have his way here tonight. Amen. and God. I'm going to speak I'm going to lay down a a few quotes here to lay down a foundation. We want to hear what the prophet said about the voice of God. Thank you. You're welcome. And God has promised to meet the need of the hour. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God has promised to meet every need in this hour. Why do we doubt? Why do we question? Why don't we just believe what God has said? Hallelujah. He always does that. And we need the voice of God today to meet the need of the hour. That's what we need. We might think we need this. We might need church. We might need uh group fellowships. We we might need conventions. We might need to go here. We might need to go there, but we need the voice of God, today, more than anything. This is the latest hour. This is the darkest hour. This is the most deceiving time of any age of any time that we're living in right now. This is the hour where Satan is putting people to sleep. People are falling away. Amen. People are becoming more religious in this message. More religious, powerless, no power in their life, no power of the Holy Ghost, but can out quote you, out scripture you, maybe even live a cleaner life than you outwardly. What an age we're living in. No other time that we need the voice of God. You say, "Brother Tim, I got the voice of God when I listen to the brother Brandham in the tapes." &gt;&gt; Listen, Brother Brandham himself said, "There will come men after the five-fold ministry that will break these highlights down that I've spoken." Now that opens up the door to every preacher, right? It opens up the word, the door to every interpretation, even mine. Don't listen to me. Listen to the word. Go back and take it back into the word and see if it's there. But men that are filled with the Holy Ghost, that got the same experience of the new birth that the prophet had, Amen, will come and the Holy Ghost, the voice of God in her will break these things down. That's the voice of God we need. Do we listen to the tapes? I listen to them all the time. I was listening to them in the parking lot before I came in here. I get blessed from him. But I also know in my spirit what the prophet was talking about that God's truth continues to march on. Amen. This has never been about William Brham the man. Hallelujah. He grew and grew and grew. He said it with his own lips. If I didn't have an angel come and tell me I was preaching certain things back there, he went through the same process that we are going through right now. Amen. People you know Jesus Christ miss understood Jesus Christ mis looked over overlooked sorry in that day here was God in flesh God in flesh it wasn't a prophet it was God in flesh overlooked here was the prophet in this last day come you have to be blind to to look into his ministry and see that that he was vindicated from God 100%. Just like he was with Moses. All these things you have to be blind overlooked. It's always been that way. And and man likes to take credit. Man likes to point them to them the people to themselves. Amen. Man likes to be glorified. But brother Brandham said a true minister of God, amen, will become nothing in the presence of God so that he can become everything &gt;&gt; and that we can point the people to him, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ, the word. And what does that mean? Oh, because I got some great revelation. No, you're still pointing it back to yourself. You're pointing back to the life, bringing you into the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why a real minister won't preach things that tickle your ears. But the word of God will convict your heart because the word is sharper than a two-edged sword. It'll go deep down. Judgment begins here in the house of God. If you're lacking, if you're lazy, if you're slacking, or if there's things in your life, Amen. God will speak to those things and it'll pierce your soul. It'll discern your heart. Amen. A lot of times God discerns your heart and speaks to your heart. Speak it speaks to your life, speaks to your condition, speaks to your ways, speaks to your attitudes, speaks to the way your thoughts are, speaks to your culture, speaks to your habits, your routines. God speaks to them and says, "They're in my way." Hallelujah. I want them out of the way. You got to hear my voice. I'm speaking to you to get those things out of the my way so I can do a work that I've already ordained in your life to do. Amen. God will always come warning before judgment. He'll come and speak to you over and over and over again. But if you don't listen to his voice, hallelujah, then God allows things to come upon our lives. He knows how to speak to us. One of the ways, Brother Brandham said, he'll get you in a hospital room looking up. Looking up. Amen. Why? We need the voice of God in this age more than any other age. More. Oh, my brothers, voices. Millions and millions and millions of voices out there. Distractions. Oh, hallelujah. Let us move on here. meet the hour, meet the need of the hour, the time that we're living in. And after he had promised it, we can rest assure that he will keep his promise. That's the confidence that a believer has in his maker. That he promised to meet the need. And today, one of the reasons that the church is in the condition that is in is because there's so many voices. Oh my. So many other voices to attract the church. Listen from the voice of God. What an hour of deception. If it would be if it was possible, think about it. It's so close. If it would be possible, the elect would be deceived. So many other voices. Oh, God. You know, there's so many voices in the in the camp. There's a voice here tonight. There's a voice there. There's a voice there. But you see, there's nothing wrong when this voice speaks the written word of God. But there's something wrong when if this voice amen distracts you or misleads you from the voice of God. They're still small voice. Hallelujah. And only the elected ones are able to catch the mind of God in this hour to lead the people to the still small voice, the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I know when I when I hear a true man of God speak the word of God, I leave outside those doors. Amen. With that still small voice, I I leave the service knowing that God spoke to my heart and nobody else knows what he spoke but me and him. &gt;&gt; Amen. He gives me instructions. He rebukes me. He puts me back in line. Hallelujah. He knows how to speak to your heart. He knows your heart. He knows you better than yourself. He knows your character. He knows where you are right now tonight in your walk with him. He knows your sensitivity. He knows your emotions. Amen. He knows your physical health. He knows everything about us tonight. And he speaks to meet the need in your heart. No man can do that. Not to the bride of Jesus Christ. She doesn't look for a man. She comes and sits down under the ministry. But she comes and sits down because she's waiting for him to come. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. So many other voices to attract the church from the voice of God. Think about it. Think about it. till it's very doubtful that many would hear the voice of God though it was spoken right in their midst. Oh, let me tell you my brothers and sisters, you know, they heard the Pharisees and Sadducees in the days of Jesus. They heard the teachings of Moses. They heard it so precise, so educated, so uh intellectual. Amen. They heard it so perfect. Those Pharisees and Sadducees, you can put a pin right through and they know exactly the word, the written word, where it went. They preached that word, they preached that law flawlessly. Let me tell you, my brothers and sisters, that same spirit, spirits don't die. Men die, but spirits don't die. Hallelujah. That same spirit is preaching this message flawlessly, making preachers, I'm going to say it for myself, like me, look like a fool. Amen. But they preach it so flawlessly, so right that when when God will take like brother Brandon says, a humble little man without any education but filled with the Holy Ghost and power &gt;&gt; go into a a a a a camp meeting that are used to big big names and big preachers and preaching like you never heard before in life and take that little man that can't even speak English. What do you think? What do you think they What do you think they're going to recognize the voice of God? No, no, no, no, no. That's not you know that that just so many thoughts going through my mind. But when I hear, you know, oh that was you should have heard the word coming from that brother. You should have heard this message. You should have heard that. Well, it's for you, not for me. Like I said the last time, keep your mouth shut. It just shows your immaturity. It just shows that you need more faith in your walk. This ain't about this man and how he preaches the word about that that man, how he preaches the word. Is that what this is about? Is that what this conviction and this walk is about in your heart? Or is it about Jesus Christ? Is it about oh, I came in contact with him. It doesn't matter where I go. I want I don't want to see the manifestation of man. I want to see the manifestation of the word of God. I want to see him in the camp manifesting and moving up and down. &gt;&gt; And when that happens, I don't say nothing. Hallelujah. I just rejoice that my eyes have been open, that I've been given to understand the mystery of his coming is here. Hallelujah. Amen. I know I always put too much notes here. I I just when I'm studying, I put too much notes and I never learn. I get up here, you guys start pulling, and I start going in all different directions. They perhaps wouldn't understand it because it would be so foreign to them. They haven't got themselves so much centered. They got themselves so much centered on the voices of the day. And if we notice in our scripture reading that the voice of God was foreign to them. Hallelujah. And it be and it becomes that way again today. It will come that way again today where we think we're coming into services that we're hearing the voice of God and the the majority of the people and the voice of God will be foreign. Listen, what's the scripture say? Hey, you say, "Brother Tim, okay Jesus said, right in this age, did he not in the Bible, did he not say that I was on the outside knocking trying to get in?" Oh, but you you you say in your mind, "Not the message, Brother Tim. That's denominations, not the message." Well, if your mind is there, then you're in a past age. you haven't moved on with the word of God for for today because the word always fulfills and repeats itself like history always repeats itself. In order for the word of God, it came to pass in Christ, all fulfillment. It came to pass in brother Brandham's ministry and his life, all fulfillment. And now the bride is here today. What do you think? She's going to walk on a bed of ease. What do you think? She's going to go through nothing. She's just going to sit in messes churches and and praise the Lord. That was a good message. Wow, that's a good preacher. That's mighty. No. No. The message has to come to a place where the scriptures must be fulfilled again. that there must be Pharisees, Sadducees, there must be unbelievers, make believers, all these things in our midst today, false prophets, false preachers, false anointed ones. You ever listen to that message lately? False anointed ones. My God, it'll open up your eyes and your senses. Amen. Hallelujah. Can that happen? It's happening. Not can it happen. It's happening. Hallelujah. And it becomes that way again today. And then if God promised he would give us that and if other voices are contrary to the voice of God, then it must be the voice of the enemy to confuse us. that we wouldn't understand the voice of God when it's spoken. Brother Brand was speaking here in the voice of God in the last days. Going to continue to read on. There are so many voices in the earth today that is absolutely hard a hard thing because it deadens the voice of the supernatural. You see what it does? He's laying it out here. And you can see it manifesting. It deadens the voice of the supernatural. You catching it? There are so many intellectual voices, great voices of mighty men who are intellectual that in their intellectual condition even shake the nations, even shake people in the message, shake churches, shake your senses, shake your emotions, shake your feelings. His bride will not be deceived. She will not be deceived because he is here to expose everything. They're just not overnight people. Preachers been preaching for 30, 40 years, but they shake nations, bring in great organizations together, great campaigns together, flow in. And a person would be a bit confused. It's enough to confuse them of how that these things go on and prosper. They go on and they prosper. They get bigger. They get bigger. You know, Brother Brandham talked about the Pentecostal churches getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And you know what he said if you if you study the message, you know what he said about it. Hallelujah. Amen. Getting bigger and bigger. When this starts happening, they get bigger and bigger. And you say, "Well, brother Tim, we want, you know, you know what I and Pastor Danny is the same way. God adds to this church, such as should be saved under this ministry. We're not here to add nobody because you know what happens?" And I I've been a deacon for 30 years. And when people come and add family and add people to this church, that's why I got no hair. And then if my hair does grow in, it's all gray. That's what it does. But when God adds to the church, hallelujah, then there's fellowship. There's Holy Ghost fellowship. There's communion. Amen. There's an understanding between each other. and we grow in our faith together and we pray in the Holy Ghost. We move in the Holy Ghost. Amen. And we see God confirming his word in our midst. That's when God adds to the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I was praying for my mom one time. I was praying and praying, you know, at the early stages trying to get everybody in. And I was praying and praying and the more I prayed for them and the more I witnessed to them the truth, I mean I I was I would walk away and go, "My God, a dummy could understand that and see that. It's so clear." But the more I would do that, the more they would push away and push away and push away and push away. So I just started praying. I praying and praying for for her, weeping and crying and weeping and crying and weeping and crying. And all of a sudden, the Holy Ghost came down. It's like I preached on uh the prayer meeting last week. Holy Ghost came down and said, "Leave it alone. It's done." And when he came down, when he speaks, his voice speaks, it just stops everything. You understand? It stops everything. Everything is over. It's done. Like when Jesus said, "It's finished." That was part of my testimony, too. when I was praying to be delivered, he said, "It's finished. It's done. &gt;&gt; It's over." And then from that day, I prayed for God to bless my mom and all that stuff, but zero worry, zero trying to persuasion. I'm not going to call her to this if she's not meant to become to this. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. The voice of God. How will we know it's the voice of God for today? Now listen. Then it was an vindicated prophet. We know we have a vindicated prophet. Amen. So there's one sign that we know is the voice of God today. Hallelujah. By a vindicated prophet. Now, today, how will we know it's the voice of God? Because it's the manifestation of the prophet's word. Amen. Do you got that? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How do we know it's God's voice today? It's the manifestation of the prophet's word, the prophet's prophecy coming to pass. Oh, God. Hallelujah. It's not all these things that are taking place that we're talking about in the message. It's not about dissecting the word and making the word so understandable for you to understand. Hallelujah. It's not about that, my brothers and sisters. That's not the voice of God today. It's the manifestation when we see the manifestation of the prophet's prophecies being fulfilled in our midst. That's what we want. That's what we want in our lives. To see a manifestation of the word coming to pass. What he has spoken, what he has said, I can identify that is coming to pass in my life. I see the Holy Ghost working in my life, bringing it to pass. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I know I'm hearing the voice of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know it sounds simple and sometimes it goes because we're we're we're so trained. We're so trained that we have interpret the voice of God because the message has trained people in a certain direction and it'll get so deceiving that only the bride of Jesus Christ will be able to hear his voice in the midst of millions. Hallelujah. This is God's prophet. And a true voice of God only brings back the real living supernatural God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; With a supernatural word. Hallelujah. Yeah. Amen. Are we listening? I know it's Wednesday night, but I'm up here. is later, you know, and I'm up here preaching and you're you're down there sitting down. I know. Hallelujah. We got to fight this flesh. Amen. But there's there's truth being spoken here that I can't reveal to you, but he has to reveal to you. Hallelujah. And the true voice of God only brings back the real living supernatural God. That's what the true voice brings back. Hallelujah. With his supernatural word, with the supernatural manifestation of the true word of God, then we know the prophet is saying, then we know that it's the voice of God. Then we can be certain in our lives in the ministry when we see that manifestation of the supernatural God in our midst that it's the voice of God being spoken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. The word of God which is inseparable from God's voice. This description as the living and activated piercing to the deepest parts of one's being convicted, speaking to the heart. The voice of many waters brings forth the supreme authority of him. Voice of many waters. How are you going to do it when it's recorded in glory? When the voice tonight is recorded, when your voice is recorded? I'm not speaking, Brother Tim. Just listen. Your thoughts are recorded. As a man thinkketh in his heart, so is he. Notice your thoughts are louder in heaven than your voice on earth. Certainly it is. God knows your thoughts and the intents of your heart. He knows all about it. You know what gave me a lot of victory in my life is when I came into the consciousness or the reality that God knows every thought that I think. Oh, you walk around your day and you think all kinds of thoughts. You walk around all kinds of situations and you think all kinds of thoughts and you think your thoughts are not being heard. You think your thoughts are not affecting your life, your spirit, your mind, your attitude, everything. When you come conscious and you get the Holy Ghost in your life and you come conscious that he is here, you see that's what it is. In that day, you will know that I'm in the father. I do nothing unless the father shows me. It's not I that speak, but it's the father that speaks to me. You'll know in that day that I'm in the father. The father is in me. We can understand and see that. But then you're going to understand, you're going to come conscious that I am in you and you are in me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That changes everything &gt;&gt; when you come conscious of that. I wonder what people are conscious of today. Some of the things that are manifest in other people's lives, some of the situations, some of the behaviors, some of the things that they speak. Hallelujah. I wonder what they're conscious of. You know, we we don't we don't sit here and we don't sit here and I'm just going as the spirit leads me now. We don't sit here and preach about TV. Hallelujah. We don't come here and sit and preach about sports and all this entertainment and all these things. Amen. But it doesn't change the fact that they are voices that they are distractions. Not not to the unbeliever, not to the makebeliever. I'm not speaking to you. You love your entertainment. You love your games. You love your TV. You love your programs. But to the bride of Jesus Christ. It's all distractions, right? &gt;&gt; You know, there is no vindication, right? And I'm not telling you not to have a TV in your house, okay? Okay, I'm not preaching legalism here, but there's no vindication in the message of the hour or approval cuz we always like to go back to brother Brandham for approval in our lives, right? Well, there's no approval for a TV. But there's a commandment that he said that I'd rather what you want to do. And you know what that is? Take your shotgun and blow it up. Isn't what's evil to us? Shouldn't we cut it off? What distracts us? Oh, you think you're going to get this Holy Ghost? You think you're going to come into this life lukewarm, lazy, distracted by all these voices? You think God is going to come to you and fill you and manifest in your life when you got so many other gods and voices and distractions in your life. There's no surrender. There's no yielding. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not number one. He's not even number two in some of your lives. Maybe number three or number four. Amen. &gt;&gt; How do I know what I'm speaking about? Cuz I've gone through it. &gt;&gt; God has convicted my heart. Amen. I had to repent many times. And I was just telling my wife, I said, "Listen, let's let's examine." The Bible says, "Examine yourself." I said to her, "Let's examine ourselves. Let's examine our why, our our lies." Do we examine ourselves every once in a while? What is our routine? Oh, we come home from work, we do this, we do that, we shower for the next day, we come down and we sit on our our our our couches in front of our TV. Oh, we watch good programs. Just letting you know that. and we watch certain programs and then we go to bed. We say a little prayer in our bed and we take those thoughts that we injected from those programs to bed with us to that sacred place of rest that God gives us where the bed should not be un it should not be defiled by anything. That's not only sexually. That's everything. That bed is a bed of rest where God reserves that place when you lie your head to rest. He'll give you perfect sleep and speak to you and make love to you. Oh my, that revelation struck me. The first thing I did, I didn't rejoice in all that. I got on my knees and was crying and weeping and repenting when the word of God spoke to me and corrected my heart. And then I bring it to my wife as the head of the house. I bring it to my wife with as much grace as I can give. And by grace, she sees it. Why? Because that first love, you lost that first love. Hallelujah. You know, there's a song out there. You lost that lovely feeling. You lost that first love. You lost that first love for God. Hallelujah. Amen. Him put put aside put aside in our homes, in our lives. Oh my Lord Jesus. He says, "Take me, my brothers and sisters, may God voice speak to somebody." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. What a horrible thing it is horrible. The word of life by a prophet of the living God. The Holy Ghost, the chance, the mercy seat is here now for each and every individual to hear the word of God and obey the word of God. for a drifting soul on the sea of life. No pilot to guide them. Listen, I'm talking to people in the message right here manifesting this in their lives. No pilot to guide them loose. Everything in their life is loose from their thinking, their talking, everything, their behavior floating with the tides of this earth, tides of this life. to hear the roar of the great cataracts, the falls, the word of God being spoken. The word of God is judgment, my brothers and sisters, to those who reject it. Reject the life. I believe it, brother Tim. I believe God said, "Prophet, no. Reject the token. Reject the life, the harder way." Oh, people rejecting that harder way when God speaks. Amen. What a horrible thing it would be for a soul drifting. Voice of many waters. What is his voice? It's a judgment. The voice of the ministers through the Holy Spirit crying out to the people and every age standing there. The voice of many waters crying out thickness and multitudes of people. The voice of those seven stars in his hand to every church age preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The baptism in Jesus name. speaking in tongues, the power of God, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the second coming, the divine judgment, the voice of many waters came forth. This one that looked like the son of man, Patmas vision. Oh my, I only got 25 minutes left and uh I just got through the little introduction here of just his quotes. So, we'll just we'll just take it. Like I said, there's going to be a part two. Let's see if we can get some things done here. Private interpretation or God's interpretation. Man's private interpretation comes with a lot of his own understanding and it comes with substitutes. Man leans on his own ways and how he sees things spiritually. Man is unconsciously always trying to figure out God and in doing so gets farther away from him. The Bible said did not say figure out God. The Bible said seek God. There's a big difference there. When you're trying to figure out God, you bring your own understanding, your own intellect into the equation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that makes you farther away from God. Hallelujah. Faith comes by hearing the written word. And when you are born, the spirit of truth reveals to you the unwritten word. Hallelujah. People are just caught up still on the written word. While the Pharisees were, brother Brandon say the denominations were. Even great inspired preaching was all on the written word. But brother Brandon's ministry come along, a real prophet of God, and his preaching was foreign to them. We can see that because he was preaching the unwritten word. They didn't understand the Pharisees and Sadducees. We don't we know your teacher sent from God, but we don't understand these things. When he said, "You must be born again to Nicodemus." He says, "I can't understand that." We look at that in the Bible for that day. But listen, my brothers and sisters, it's the same thing today. It might be a different written word that people don't understand and they're trying to interpret, but it's the same process. It's the same manifestation that's taking place today in an unborn again believer of this message. Hallelujah. See, it reveals the truth to you of the unwritten word. That is the token life that it lives automatically out of your mind, soul, and body. Hallelujah. The works are gone. Man is gone. You are dead. As Paul says, I die daily. There's no more left of you. But now the token life. Amen. His life. As Paul said, it's not I that live, but it's Christ that live within me. He was talking about the token. Now it's him living. Come into a place of maturity and understanding and recognizing, amen, that there is a Christ living inside of you. And it destroys as the process takes place, as the replacement takes place, it destroys your understanding. It destroys your interpretation. We all have it, my brothers and sisters. You come in a message, you listen to the seals, you listen to the churches, you listen to all kinds of messages, and you bring it in. You bring it in and you think you got it. You don't got it. You don't got it. You understand it according to your understanding. That's the truth, my brothers and sisters. Amen. But when he comes and quickens that, what happens? It brings forth life. He brings forth life. He can only bring forth life. His life when he quickens that. Now, now am I saying it's bad? No. It's good. It's good to to listen. It's good to read. It's good to do all these things, but that's not it. And that's where the devil deceives the people thinking you got it and you don't got it. Think you see it but you don't see it. And that is dangerous. That's not a preacher up here being negative. Amen. And trying to push you down. But that is dangerous because it stops. That's a Satan's trick to stop the process uh amen. Of the maturity of the word, the seed to grow inside of you to come to life and awaken. Oh, he tries to muddle things up so many different ways. If we had a thousand tongues, we wouldn't even describe. He's a master of deception, Satan. He's a master of taking the word like he did with Eve, and taking it and twisting it so you don't get the real substance of the word of God, the real life. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. God needs man. The prophet said it and the word of God says God doesn't need man. It's true. A lot of things that are said that looked like they're contrary to each other. So what is the answer to this? It's the new birth. That's the answer. It's always been the answer. Nothing starts in your life, in your walk. Nothing starts without the new birth. That is the starting point. That's why brother Brandon says if you know if you don't know that you're born again, then you need to start there. Don't worry about my your ministry. Don't worry about your gifts. Don't worry about all your works. Get to that place that you know that you know that you're born again and that the spirit of God is confirmed in your life. Listen me, let me tell you. If there's a seed of God inside of you, I know my experience and other born again believers experience. Listen, that's the only thing when the Holy Spirit touches that seed that you go after, that you seek after. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah is a new birth. That is what God needs from a man to be born again so he can interpret his word to her through her. Amen. That's the only reason why he needs man. The problem is men and women are not being born again today. Oh my. That's a sermon in itself. not being born again today. Brother Brandham talked about, you know, not being led to Christ. All these churches not leading people to the real true Holy Ghost experience with Christ. Oh my, have we gotten to such a place in the message today? So intellectual preaching the word so fine. Oh my, it just tickles your ears. It tickles your your emotions, your spirit. Hallelujah. Check it. Tick. It just gets to your senses and fantasizes your senses. The word is preached in such a way that you walk out of here and realize after a while nothing. Brother Graham says Billy Graham goes into the the city and he preaches the and 30,000 people come to the altar and next and the year after he come he comes back he can't even find 30. Listen we look at these things and we think it's just for the denominations and out there not in the message. That's what I'm trying to get to you and the ministers are trying to get to. It's here. The deception is here. The manifestation of Satan and his deception is here and a word has got to be preached. Amen. To expose it so that God can show you, not man. God can show you the way individually how you must walk. Didn't he say that in the word? I'll show you the way and the way that you must go. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Got a few more minutes here. And they're not accepting God's way of receiving it the harder way. And that's where there are so many individual private interpretations in the message. Only those who have received the new birth from the father. As Jesus said, flesh and blood has not revealed it to you. Without that, all you got is flesh and blood interpretation. Man's own understanding. Satan knows the word, brother. All I do is feed off the word. The written word. It's a written word. Satan knows it better than you. I I'm not going to come to Satan and and and say, you know, I claim I stand here tonight that I know the written word. You'll make me look like a fool. He'll make me look like a fool with the written word. But when the unwritten word, the born again experience, that's a different story. Hallelujah. Amen. God comes now. God steps forward on the scene and he speaks. And he's the same God that said, "Let there be light." Amen. And there was. Let there be this. And there was that same created spoken word power of God is now in the bride. And when he comes forward and he speaks &gt;&gt; one revelation, &gt;&gt; amen. One David stone to Goliath's head. So I don't stand here claiming the written word, knowing all the message, all the quotes, and all all the mysteries. But I know him by his grace. I know him. And if I know him, when I need to know something, he'll speak it to me. When I need to know. Hallelujah. Some of you need to know everything all the time. Some of you boggle your mind up so much cuz you need to know. You need to know. Listen, get to a place. You don't need to know anything until he comes and gives you what you need to know. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We have the first birth which God gave us the ability to read the written word. The first birth, the natural birth, writing and the brain to understand a lot of things in our reasoning called education. The second birth called the new birth. He gives us one thing, the Holy Ghost. The first birth gives us so many other things. The second birth gives us one thing, the Holy Ghost. But the Holy Ghost, oh my, gives us the ability to understand all things. But both can be used to look at the word, the written word. Think about it. and the message both of them and interpret it. But there are two different results at the end of it. The two seeds, the two vines, reading, studying, listening to the same word, but there's always two different results. Hallelujah. Amen. One produces a self-righteous legalistic interpretation and a carnal impersonation that produces dead nonseed life. Inside, as Jesus said, you are dead man bones. On the outside, you're righteous and you're dead works doing everything by works and not by faith. That's the first birth and what it produces in a religious spirit. And that is prominent. Prominent dominant today and majority today in the message. Might not like me. That's fine. I'll still love you. I'm going to tell you what I believe is the truth. What God reveals to me. Amen. Hallelujah. The second birth, you become a new creature, a new creation in Christ. All things have passed away. All things become new. Now you lean not to your own understanding, but the spirit of truth guides you and leads you and reveals the word to you. Hallelujah. You know what? I can go on and on and on, but I'm feeling just uh invite the musicians up. I'm going to bring some of this stuff later on. Amen. And invite the musicians up. Hallelujah. I just feel it's time to just say a few things here and then close her off. Hallelujah. you just continue to pray for me. I been getting heavy attacks up here. I don't show it. Dizzy spells, all kinds of stuff happening, but God is grace is sufficient to bring his word. Amen. Hallelujah. Let me just close off with this in in in uh preparing for our next service here. Brother Brandon speaking here in Lee. You'll see in church age. The spirit and the bride say come. The corner wheat, the bide wheat that fell into the ground at Nika has come back to its original word grain again. Praise God forever. Yes. Listen to this authentic prophet of God who appears in the last age. what he says from God, the bride will say the same revelation that God gave him, God is going to give to the bride and they're going to be saying the same thing. The spirit and the prophet and the bride will say the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word. They are saying it now. Come out from amongst her now and be ye separated. Is that what the spirit of God is saying in the message to the bride? The cry has gone out. The cry has been going out. How long will you listen and not heed to the cry? to the voice of God. The cry is going out. How long will the voice cry? We do not know. But one thing we do know, it won't be long. For this is the last age. Yes, sir. The church, and I've said this before, the message is no longer the mouthpiece of God. It's his own mouthpiece. That's what it's developed into. Pray and ask God to show you and open up your eyes. It's its own mouthpiece. So God is turning on her. He will confront her through the prophet and the bride now. Oh yes. Right here. For the voice of God will be in her. Oh, God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride. That voice is in the bride. And as we have said, he's he's talking here, but I'm saying this too. As we have said, we will talk more about this later. And we will we will talk about this more later. Hallelujah. I didn't know it was going to go in this direction, my brothers and sisters, but the spirit of God knows. And I thank God because it gives me confidence up here to know that I didn't come with my own thoughts. I didn't come with my intellectual. [Music] My education is only so high anyways. But I don't lean on that. I don't confirm myself by all these things, but I know that the Holy Spirit put me aside and spoke tonight. And in my heart is burning that somebody received something from him. Not from the 80% that I gave you, the written word that I, but God spoke to your heart. Maybe he's turning somebody around. Maybe it's that vision that Brother Brandham's seen, the bride getting out of line and the voice is speaking, "Stay in line. The hour's late, the hour's dark, the deception is rising more and more. Stay with me. Separate from the voices. Separate from the distractions. Come back to me. Come back to my love. Come back to my grace. I'm waiting for you to take you back in and love you. Get away from all this own interpretations. Get away from trying to interpret things in your life. I'll interpret it. God says, "I'm my own interpreter. I will make it plain to you." Wait upon the Lord and he shall renew your strength. He shall renew your walk. He shall refill you with the Holy Ghost. That's what we want. a church moving in the supernatural, seeing the supernatural God, seeing the supernatural word manifest in our midst. That's what attracted me. I didn't want religion. When I came to this, what attracted me was I seen the supernatural word of God moving in our midst, manifesting all around my life, speaking. You talk about a whirlwind of God all around you. And it's not all these different voices. It was one voice all around me speaking. I love you. I called you. I predestinated you. You're mine. Oh God, you're mine. I love you. Fear not. I am with you. In you to the end. Fear not. The greatest thing. Fear. The greatest tool. Satan. Fear. Fear not. Listen, it's going to be preached by real ministers of God in such a way that if you don't know who you are, listen to me. If you don't know who you are, you're not going to see anything. You're going to be confused. [Music] But if you know who you are, you can sit under that anointing and say, "Thank you, Lord." Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. Let us stand and let us pray. Father, we thank you, Lord, [Music] for what you do in our lives. I pray for each and every one and myself. I pray for the sick. I pray for the needy. I pray for the emotional needs, the spiritual needs, the physical needs. I pray for our pastor in a position, his precious wife. I pray the Holy Ghost will continue to move in his life in a supernatural way. I've seen it right from the beginning in our fellowships, in our growing together. It's nothing but supernatural. And Lord, we don't want nothing else but that. We don't want a compromise with the flesh in this world and the things of this world. No, it's too late in the hour. We want the supernatural movement manifestation of the word of God in our lives. And that's it. Lord, we want you more than anything. Lord, separate us, oh God. We can't do it on our own. Let the Holy Ghost, the power of God, raise a standard within us. Oh God, make your word more real. Father, we ask and all we can do is ask for more faith. Raise a standard. Give us strength, Lord. Here we are at the end, the most deceiving age. Father, you left us here, but not without a witness, Lord. Not without you coming, oh God, because it's impossible for us to make it out of here without you being here, Father. They're looking for his coming out there. Even people in the message are looking for his coming. But you have come. You are here. You are here. That's thus sayeth the Lord. I'm in my bride. Hallelujah. Thank you, Father. Bless each and every one, Lord. Into your hands. Not my hands, not any ministry's hands, but into your hands. I commit each and every one, Father, in the word of God tonight, Lord. Jesus name we ask. And I love [Music] he [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] here and I love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you all. Have a wonderful evening, brother Brian. Have a wonderful trip. Amen. and God bless your trip and and uh thank God that he has come and is interpreted himself through his people. Just say praise the Lord. Thank you for the word tonight. And don't forget we walk in the light. Such a beautiful night. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] All around [Music] [Music] [Music] Mercy. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jesus. [Music] [Applause] I will walk such a beautiful way. [Music] Jesus. Well, the more that I surrender, the lighter my Lord. The more that I release my cares, the more he takes control. [Music] More that I can humble myself, the more he lifts me every day. Lord, I love
