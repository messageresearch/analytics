[36:31] is a time where we need to be walking
[36:33] with God Amen if there was ever a time
[36:35] that we know that we must know who we
[36:39] are and know who he is it's now amen
[36:42] praise God God bless you Saints thank
[36:45] you worship team amen praise God as we
[36:48] move into Heavenly places we go there
[36:51] because we want to meet with the Lord
[36:53] amen and you got to leave everything
[36:54] behind you got to put the weak behind
[36:56] you you got to put all the the burdens
[36:59] behind you I know there's things that
[37:00] are heavy on your hearts but when you
[37:03] come into the house of the Lord on
[37:05] Wednesday night or on Sunday morning you
[37:07] need to you need to know that you're
[37:09] coming into his presence you need to
[37:12] know that you're coming into a an
[37:13] atmosphere where all things are possible
[37:17] where the word can speak to your very
[37:19] needs and your circumstances and the
[37:22] situations that you're dealing with and
[37:24] they and the answers can be received but
[37:28] you need to receive the answer you see
[37:30] that's the difference the Lord will
[37:32] speak to you and he'll give you the
[37:33] direction he'll speak to you through his
[37:36] uh provided way amen praise God a lot of
[37:39] times we have our own interpretation on
[37:41] how God has to speak to us but no we
[37:44] need to understand that that when we
[37:46] come into the house of the Lord and the
[37:48] man that stands behind this this Pulpit
[37:51] here is Anointed of God Amen if you
[37:55] truly believe that he's anointed of God
[37:57] okay and and and know that uh that we're
[38:00] living in a time in a season where
[38:02] there's a lot of false anointings amen
[38:05] but if you know then your faith has to
[38:08] be zeroed
[38:10] in that the voice of God will speak to
[38:13] your need and speak to the situation
[38:16] that you're dealing with if you don't
[38:19] have that kind of faith yet you're not
[38:22] moving under the ministry of this hour
[38:25] Ministry is for the perfecting of the
[38:28] Saints amen so God will anoint those
[38:32] offices and those positions because he
[38:35] can never lie no that's his word amen
[38:39] that's his provided way amen and
[38:41] everybody has a different level of faith
[38:45] that God needs to meet amen you know so
[38:48] you can't you can't come into the
[38:50] service and and be expecting that that
[38:52] God is only going to be speaking the
[38:54] supernatural opening of the word and the
[38:56] Seven Seals and the breaking of the word
[38:58] and and you know all these things when
[39:02] when there's some that are moving at a
[39:04] at a at a level and I I can tell you
[39:06] there's people that have been in this
[39:07] message for years that can't even get
[39:10] along with one another they got
[39:12] situations that where they can't even
[39:14] really love their brother or their
[39:16] sister and yet they've Walking with God
[39:19] for so many years but they still haven't
[39:21] got they haven't come into that
[39:24] Capstone the Capstone is perfect love
[39:28] and it casts out all unbelief when you
[39:31] can't you can't go in there brother Bram
[39:32] says he went beyond the curtain of time
[39:34] he said nothing but perfect love can
[39:37] enter into this place so think about
[39:41] that for a while and then and then ask
[39:43] yourself about the situations that
[39:45] you're dealing with and the
[39:46] circumstances that you're allowing the
[39:48] enemy to to to burden you with distract
[39:52] you with pull you away from you know oh
[39:55] I got to go to this church maybe I'll
[39:57] get it there oh I got to go here no
[39:59] you're running from God that's what
[40:00] you're
[40:01] doing God will meet you where you are
[40:05] and he'll speak through a donkey if he
[40:07] needs to do it amen amen praise God
[40:10] hallelujah I don't know how I got off on
[40:11] all that but praise God we're in the
[40:14] house of the Lord this morning I want to
[40:16] welcome each and every one of you into
[40:18] the house of the Lord amen I want to
[40:20] welcome our guests I want to welcome
[40:23] Emmanuel an with us this morning amen
[40:28] praise
[40:29] God you know um we love our children
[40:34] amen we love them with all of our heart
[40:37] we know that you know many of them are
[40:39] still out there and they're working on
[40:41] their testimonies that's all because God
[40:43] said all
[40:45] that you and your household okay now you
[40:49] can take that and a lot of people oh but
[40:51] they got to be the bride they got to be
[40:52] this listen don't put that kind of
[40:54] interpretation on it listen all I know
[40:56] is I'm going to tell you right now my
[40:58] children are blessed amen they're
[41:00] blessed because we are the sons and
[41:03] daughters of God and my children are
[41:06] blessed because we pray for them because
[41:08] we we we believe for them amen we apply
[41:12] the token whether they like it or not
[41:14] the blood is being applied Oh Glory to
[41:17] God Amen and and at some point if God
[41:19] listen while while we were yet sinners
[41:22] he loved us amen amen I can only go back
[41:25] and look at my own life and I was living
[41:27] life of total sin and unbelief a million
[41:30] miles from God but when God wants to
[41:33] call his own the Gates of Hell will not
[41:37] Prevail against him doing it so don't
[41:39] you worry about nothing just let the
[41:41] Lord do what he's doing you walk with
[41:44] God you make sure your calling and your
[41:47] election is for sure amen praise God
[41:51] I've seen it where kids all of a sudden
[41:53] come in and the parents go out
[41:57] what is
[41:58] it it's based on God's election it's
[42:01] based on Revelation amen praise God so
[42:05] we certainly welcome Emmanuel we we
[42:08] continue to pray for our children while
[42:10] they're out there praise God Amen um I
[42:13] just want to let you know uh that you
[42:15] know this week I don't know I don't
[42:17] believe uh Brother Joseph is Brother
[42:19] Joseph and sister Rachel here today uh I
[42:22] guess they're not here but anyways um
[42:24] you know we know that uh you know they
[42:27] they were going through a tremendous
[42:29] battle I love and appreciate them I want
[42:32] to say that they are a couple of the uh
[42:34] most courageous individuals that I've
[42:37] met amen they they they truly expressed
[42:41] Faith through this entire um event that
[42:45] they went through their little girl yel
[42:48] okay um that they named yahel you know
[42:52] God you know L is female you know she
[42:56] was a beautiful little girl you know um
[42:59] uh it's just in the plan of God that she
[43:01] had to go to heaven now amen praise God
[43:06] even to where their you know Joseph and
[43:08] Rachel had so much wisdom and you know
[43:11] they they taught their their little girl
[43:13] Abigail all about it and you know and
[43:16] Abigail you know is is a beautiful young
[43:19] little lady that uh you know she's only
[43:22] less than 5 years old but she's she was
[43:24] expressing faith and love you know even
[43:27] uh when we saw her um in the afternoon
[43:30] you know praise God they um they they
[43:33] had to let that child go into the hands
[43:36] of the Lord they had enough Faith to
[43:38] release that child and know that they
[43:40] will see her again that's what he said
[43:43] he said brother Danny says we've had to
[43:45] make that decision because you know they
[43:48] they they the doctors and the medical
[43:50] and everything else and they prayed and
[43:52] they believed that God can do anything
[43:54] and we believe that God can do anything
[43:55] and if God wanted to do it he would have
[43:57] done it but God has a purpose in
[43:59] everything that he does and all I could
[44:01] see is you know that that that they
[44:03] expressed Faith through it all now we
[44:06] were there at the funeral home and and
[44:08] they had the baby there and we saw it it
[44:10] was a beautiful little perfect little
[44:13] baby girl you know but God chose that it
[44:16] was her time to go to heaven amen and so
[44:19] we know you know absent from the body
[44:21] present with the Lord and you know I'll
[44:24] tell you I you know as I Was preparing
[44:26] for the funeral the Lord just showed me
[44:29] something you know in in David you know
[44:31] David went through a time where the Lord
[44:34] took one of his children you know he
[44:36] fasted and he prayed and he was asking
[44:39] the Lord to change his mind and
[44:41] everything else but after the baby had
[44:44] had had the Lord had taken the child
[44:48] David got up from his fasting and
[44:50] praying took a shower washed himself
[44:53] realized that that listen the Lord uh
[44:57] this child is not going to be coming
[44:59] back to me but what he said was that I
[45:02] will go to the child Hallelujah he knew
[45:05] that he would see that child again he
[45:08] knew and just like Joseph and Rachel
[45:10] they know they'll be reunited with that
[45:11] child just like brother branam when he
[45:13] went beyond the curtain of time he saw
[45:17] his daughter she says I was your
[45:19] daughter on Earth she was a young lady
[45:22] but she was only a baby of 18 months
[45:24] when she left this Earth amen and so
[45:28] there's faith in the hearts of the True
[45:30] Believers that regardless of what we're
[45:33] going through God will give us the faith
[45:36] to he'll never allow more than what you
[45:39] can handle and I saw you know you know I
[45:42] saw in the afternoon when we got
[45:45] together there was probably 40 or 50 of
[45:47] their family there and my goodness
[45:49] Rachel was sister Rachel was weeping and
[45:52] crying at the funeral home and and just
[45:54] you know just sobbing and mourning for
[45:58] that
[45:59] child like any
[46:03] mother but when she went home in that
[46:06] afternoon I saw the
[46:09] faith she wiped away the
[46:12] tears The Joy came on
[46:15] her she ate with us she fellowshipped
[46:20] with us he fellowshipped with us I saw
[46:24] an expression of faith and I know her
[46:27] family must have wondered because they
[46:30] they said brother Danny we're so glad
[46:33] that you were here and you were a part
[46:34] of this uh event for us it really meant
[46:38] a lot we wanted to we want our family to
[46:41] to recognize what it is that we believe
[46:44] they were they were concerned about
[46:45] their family amen praise God and so
[46:48] they've got a heart to see salvation in
[46:51] their home amen so let's continue to
[46:54] pray for them they're a beautiful
[46:56] addition to this local Ministry they're
[46:58] excited about being a part of the
[47:00] ministry their mother and uh Joseph's
[47:02] mother and father they are believers
[47:04] from from from when they were children
[47:07] amen they were brought up in this
[47:09] message of God in India and they are
[47:12] showing that faith and expressing that
[47:15] faith and it's absolutely wonderful I
[47:17] believe we're all going to be blessed
[47:19] and I believe that we need to pray for
[47:20] them that the Lord will continue to
[47:22] bless them and use them amen praise God
[47:25] so God bless you all
[47:27] let's um I don't want to keep you
[47:28] standing any longer let's go to the word
[47:30] of God
[47:31] Amen we are going to continue um where
[47:35] we left
[47:37] off um a couple of weeks ago the Lord's
[47:40] just led me you know there's there's a
[47:42] lot going on in the world right now with
[47:44] Israel amen and so you know nothing
[47:48] excites me more than to know that Israel
[47:51] is a perfect type of the true church the
[47:55] spiritual church she's the natural we're
[47:57] the spiritual everything is in perfect
[48:00] type and as you read and boy as I've
[48:02] been reading and studying this week you
[48:04] know countless hours of just reading and
[48:08] going through messages and quotes and
[48:11] the Bible and scriptures I am seeing so
[48:14] clearly how God had this tremendous Plan
[48:18] of Redemption and how he was expressing
[48:21] it naturally on the earth and now
[48:24] spiritually in us the true church the
[48:27] Bride of Jesus Christ amen and so let's
[48:30] see what the Lord is going to reveal to
[48:32] us if you've come here this morning with
[48:34] expectation in your hearts God is going
[48:36] to speak to you amen God is going to
[48:39] speak to the situations that you're
[48:41] dealing with through these uh you know
[48:44] through through the ministry this
[48:45] morning I truly believe that amen praise
[48:48] God so let's go to the scripture we're
[48:50] going to read from Daniel 12:
[48:53] 9-10 and and and he says here and he
[48:56] said go thy Way Daniel for thy for the
[48:58] words are closed up and sealed till the
[49:01] time of the end many shall be purified
[49:05] and made white and tried I believe
[49:08] that's he's talking about us amen many
[49:11] are going to be purified tried amen and
[49:14] made white but the wicked shall do
[49:17] wickedly the church is going to do what
[49:19] she knows needs to be done the enemy is
[49:22] going to try and do his job the best
[49:24] that he can because we know we're not
[49:26] fighting against Flesh and Blood amen
[49:28] but the wicked shall do wickedly and
[49:30] none of the wicked shall understand they
[49:33] they'll be doing what they're doing
[49:35] without any Revelation they think that
[49:37] they're going to win the battle you know
[49:39] Satan thinks that because you know he
[49:41] can afflict our lives and afflict our
[49:43] homes at times and and put division be
[49:46] between us and and try to you know uh
[49:49] get us to fight up at our at work or
[49:52] whatever it is that that that he's going
[49:54] to win the battle no God is already w
[49:56] won the battle amen why because the wise
[50:00] shall understand amen father we thank
[50:04] you for your word this morning Lord let
[50:06] that wisdom of your anointing come down
[50:10] into the midst of the house and Lord
[50:12] anoint speaker and hearer Lord that we
[50:15] can just rejoice in Heavenly places
[50:18] receiving the portion of the word that
[50:19] you've ordained for us today that's what
[50:23] we're interested in Lord the present
[50:25] truth Grant it we pray father in jesus'
[50:28] name amen God bless you Saints you may
[50:31] be
[50:34] seated amen praise God and
[50:38] so here brother brandham says next slide
[50:41] he says um this is the one most
[50:44] important scripture in the book what
[50:47] does it do it tells the closing of the
[50:50] Jewish Nation the Jewish people this
[50:54] scripture the 70 of weeks it discloses
[50:57] and tells exactly from the time that
[51:00] Daniel started there until the end of
[51:02] the consummation it's one of the
[51:04] greatest time pieces how many has heard
[51:07] me say if you want to know what day of
[51:10] the week it is look at the calendar if
[51:13] you want to know what time we're living
[51:15] in watch the Jews that's right there is
[51:19] God's calendar taken right from right
[51:23] here any Theologian any Bible scholar
[51:26] anyone will tell you that this is the
[51:29] time piece the Jews amen praise God and
[51:34] so you know like we said everything that
[51:38] we read scripturally about Israel you
[51:42] can look and find Jesus Christ speaking
[51:47] to you about yourself about your walk
[51:51] about how he's with you about how he is
[51:54] going to overshadow you he's going to
[51:57] give you your land amen and how that
[52:00] nobody is going to take your land if God
[52:02] gives you something there's nobody no no
[52:06] devil in hell that can take it away from
[52:08] you whatever is ordained to you is yours
[52:13] and nobody else can take it amen praise
[52:16] God and so when we look at Israel it's a
[52:19] prophetic time piece and so when we see
[52:21] Israel in this battle that's going on
[52:24] right now you can know that there's
[52:25] battles going around and around your
[52:28] life as the bride of Christ the True
[52:30] Church of God Amen Israel is fighting to
[52:33] keep their land the enemy is trying to
[52:36] take their land amen Israel is standing
[52:39] listen God gave you the word God gave
[52:43] you his his promises amen the devil's
[52:46] trying to steal your promises he's
[52:49] trying to steal what God has given you
[52:51] but you've got to hold the land you've
[52:53] got to stand upon the word if if you
[52:56] know if Israel is a minority it's
[52:59] because you the true church is a
[53:01] minority amen praise God Israel being
[53:04] rejected because she's God's chosen
[53:07] people well Jesus Christ said my sheep
[53:10] hear my
[53:12] voice and they'll follow me and when we
[53:16] go and turn around and we say hey we've
[53:18] heard the voice of God in our day we've
[53:21] heard that we're God's chosen people and
[53:25] the reason why we know we're God's
[53:27] chosen people is because we've
[53:29] recognized what he's doing now we're
[53:33] seeing what he's doing amongst the
[53:36] churches and we're recognizing that we
[53:39] have a part to to to fulfill in this day
[53:43] as a true Christian church amen praise
[53:47] God so if the chosen people of Israel
[53:49] are being rejected I can guarantee you
[53:52] that the true church she's being
[53:55] rejected amen amen praise God let's go
[53:58] to the next slide now we know that we've
[54:01] just come through these Jewish feasts
[54:04] okay now when I say Jewish feasts I also
[54:06] want you to you know I want to let you
[54:08] know that these are also our
[54:11] feasts now but the difference okay we
[54:14] understand you know we understand
[54:17] rashash Shana okay by Revelation that it
[54:20] was all about God's creation and that
[54:24] God had a plan in his mind mind that he
[54:27] was going to be a redeemer and that he
[54:29] was going to be a a father that he was
[54:31] going to be a Healer amen praise God and
[54:34] that we are we are celebrating that he
[54:38] is Jehovah Elohim the self-existent one
[54:41] the one that created all things and
[54:44] we've come to recognize him in this day
[54:47] that he's still in control of all things
[54:50] amen praise God everything that he did
[54:53] in the Book of Genesis was just a type
[54:56] of what he was going to do in the life
[54:59] of the body of Jesus Christ amen praise
[55:03] God so we understand about the Feast of
[55:06] yam Kapur rashash Shana was on October
[55:09] the 2nd to the 4th Feast of yam kapor
[55:12] October the 11th and 12th and now
[55:14] they're they're in the feast all part of
[55:16] the Feast of Tabernacles let's go to the
[55:18] next
[55:20] slide amen and and and and the Feast of
[55:24] of soot okay which is also a feast um
[55:29] it's you know uh SOC called also known
[55:32] as the Feast of Tabernacles amen or
[55:35] Feast of booths is a Torah uh you know
[55:38] commanded holiday celebr celebrated for
[55:41] seven days and this year it begins on
[55:43] the the 16th and it ends on the 23rd and
[55:47] it's all about the Feast of booths the
[55:49] you know the children of Israel
[55:50] remembering when they were in the
[55:52] wilderness that they had to you know be
[55:55] in these temporary
[55:56] booths amen but we know that all of
[56:00] these feasts here these are all the
[56:01] seven feasts of the lord we don't listen
[56:05] just like Christmas like Christmas it's
[56:09] it's a it's a tradition amen if there's
[56:12] any real feasts it's these
[56:14] feasts because these all type the Plan
[56:18] of Redemption the story of Jesus Christ
[56:21] the plan of God on how he came as a he
[56:25] as a as a cre Creator and how he
[56:27] expressed himself into the form of a
[56:30] family and how he had to come and that's
[56:32] why when we look at these seven feasts
[56:35] we see them it's not that we you know we
[56:38] we do them in in natural form okay it's
[56:44] it's more that we have a revelation of
[56:46] the Passover amen we have a revelation
[56:49] of the unleavened bread we have a
[56:51] revelation of the first fruits we have a
[56:54] revelation of Pentecost
[56:57] amen we have a revelation of the
[56:58] trumpets which is the season that we're
[57:00] currently in amen praise God because the
[57:03] trumpets is all about uh uh uh the
[57:06] Gathering when the trumpet sounded it
[57:09] was because they were gathering the
[57:11] people to a certain Feast they were
[57:13] gathering the people to come unto the
[57:16] Lord so that the Lord could speak to
[57:18] them they would have holy convocations
[57:21] which is what gatherings in the house of
[57:23] the Lord what are we doing this morning
[57:26] we are under the Feast of trumpets amen
[57:29] because the trumpet shall sound and the
[57:31] dead in Christ shall rise first and we
[57:34] which are alive and remain shall be
[57:36] caught up together to meet the Lord in
[57:39] the air there is an in gathering going
[57:42] on right now amen praise God and so we
[57:45] have a revelation of all of these feasts
[57:47] we know that there's going to be the
[57:48] atonement that's going to come to the
[57:50] Jews but guess what we can't be here for
[57:54] that to happen Oh Glory to God Amen
[57:57] that's why when we look at this time
[58:00] piece when we look at these feasts when
[58:03] we see the condition of Israel and what
[58:05] is going on in Israel what what God is
[58:09] is asking us to do while we're still
[58:11] here is recognize the time recognize the
[58:15] hour but also recognize that you are the
[58:18] Gentile church that you are the ones
[58:21] that at some point that dispensation the
[58:24] Gentile dispensation is going to end
[58:27] amen and so there's something that that
[58:30] that we need to recognize so that we in
[58:33] the part that we are to
[58:35] fulfill gives us the faith to know what
[58:38] we are to do with the word we need to
[58:41] know what it is that God has called us
[58:44] the true church in this day and in this
[58:46] hour to do in order for this prophecy of
[58:51] God the Messiah coming to his own Amen
[58:54] in Israel listen God deals with Israel
[58:58] as a nation not as
[59:01] individuals so if God is dealing with
[59:04] them as a nation that's why he had them
[59:07] go back to Israel in
[59:09] 1948 and it's not all Israel that's
[59:12] going to be saved it's the 144,000 the
[59:17] 12 tribes of of Judah the 12 tribes that
[59:21] that that God ordained to be the elected
[59:25] that those are the chosen the election
[59:28] of God Amen praise God God has a book
[59:32] and in that book is written the Lamb's
[59:34] Book of Life it contains the names of
[59:37] every son and every daughter of
[59:41] God and your name has to be called amen
[59:45] praise God and so we need to realize
[59:48] that this time that we're living in is
[59:51] an important time let's move on Amen so
[59:56] Israel will come to recognize that all
[59:59] the
[1:00:00] Traditions they were at some point when
[1:00:03] this atonement strikes Israel they're
[1:00:05] going to realize all these Traditions
[1:00:06] that they've been doing going to you
[1:00:08] know the Feast of of of of yam Kapur and
[1:00:12] and rashash Shana and going to the
[1:00:13] Tabernacle it was all for for in their
[1:00:16] minds it's it's it's all tradition
[1:00:19] because they are doing what God asked
[1:00:21] them to do but yet they will come to
[1:00:24] realize that all of those Traditions
[1:00:27] will be culminated when the Messiah
[1:00:30] reveals himself to them because they
[1:00:32] they don't realize that they're doing
[1:00:34] all these things out of
[1:00:36] works but when when it's like it's like
[1:00:39] the churches today everything they're
[1:00:40] doing it's out of Works they're they're
[1:00:43] they they join they come together on
[1:00:45] Sunday they don't care what's being
[1:00:47] preached over the pulpit they don't
[1:00:49] realize that there's doctrines of man
[1:00:52] that's being preached and they believe
[1:00:53] that that's okay you see they've taken
[1:00:56] the traditions of man they've taken uh
[1:00:59] traditions and allowed those things to
[1:01:02] be their
[1:01:03] absolute when when God is telling us
[1:01:07] clearly that there's only one absolute
[1:01:10] and that is the pure unadulterated word
[1:01:12] of God Amen praise God and so they are
[1:01:15] going to come to realize and the Lord um
[1:01:19] is currently doing this for the church
[1:01:22] he's bringing us out of tradition he's
[1:01:25] bringing us out of out of those those oh
[1:01:28] I'm I'm I'm a church member I belong to
[1:01:31] this church my father was a Baptist so
[1:01:34] I'm a Baptist oh my parents were Roman
[1:01:37] Catholic so I'm Roman Catholic you ask
[1:01:40] them if they've been baptized or tell
[1:01:42] you oh yeah I got baptized as a baby
[1:01:44] that is not a legitimate
[1:01:47] baptism we don't baptize babies because
[1:01:51] babies cannot believe we dedicate them
[1:01:54] unto the Lord amen and the Lord promises
[1:01:57] that he will be with them watch over
[1:01:59] them and and overshadow their lives and
[1:02:02] at their appointed time in season he
[1:02:05] will awaken them to know who they truly
[1:02:07] are and have a conscious Revelation and
[1:02:12] relationship with God Amen praise God
[1:02:15] and so these these feasts of the lord
[1:02:18] they're all types they're all wonderful
[1:02:23] but they're all for
[1:02:27] Israel to be until the time that they
[1:02:31] come to their Great Awakening amen
[1:02:35] praise God so let's move
[1:02:39] on so today I want to talk a little bit
[1:02:42] about like the theme of what we're going
[1:02:44] to be speaking on today is the time of
[1:02:47] Jubilee because I believe that we're
[1:02:49] living in a Time listen when Israel does
[1:02:52] have their atonement there's going to be
[1:02:54] a tremendous Jubilee amen there's going
[1:02:57] to be a time where they're going to come
[1:02:58] to realize who Jesus Christ really was
[1:03:01] that they actually missed the Messiah
[1:03:02] but right now this Church the true body
[1:03:06] of Jesus Christ she is in her time of
[1:03:10] Jubilee and if they're not in their time
[1:03:13] of Jubilee they need to come to know the
[1:03:15] true Jubilee they need to come to
[1:03:18] understand that we are in the time of
[1:03:20] Jubilee and you need to be set free from
[1:03:22] the bondage of your denominational
[1:03:26] Church uh uh mentality and way of
[1:03:29] thinking that that that you're that
[1:03:31] you're actually worshiping God and not
[1:03:33] realizing that you're not worshiping God
[1:03:36] but you're actually worshiping the
[1:03:37] traditions of man the teachings of man
[1:03:40] and anything that is not of God is of
[1:03:44] the enemy remember his goal is one thing
[1:03:48] to deceive to deceive and he's doing a
[1:03:52] great job of it the Bible says that that
[1:03:55] in the end time which is where we are
[1:03:57] right now that the whole world would be
[1:04:00] in a state of
[1:04:02] deception imagine the whole world would
[1:04:05] be deceived except the Bible says except
[1:04:08] those whose names were written in the
[1:04:11] Lamb's Book of Life and how do you know
[1:04:14] your name's written in the book of life
[1:04:16] because you recognize that when Christ
[1:04:19] does something in your day you can say
[1:04:21] Amen to it and you can come out of the
[1:04:24] tradition you look back at the tradition
[1:04:26] you say that's a lie that's not in the
[1:04:29] word of God when when you see baptism in
[1:04:31] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ every
[1:04:34] baptism in the book of Acts there was
[1:04:35] over 8,000 of them every one of them
[1:04:37] done in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:04:39] Christ and you look back at your
[1:04:41] experience in your church whether it's
[1:04:43] Baptist whether it's uh Pentecostal
[1:04:46] Methodist Presbyterian Lutheran whatever
[1:04:49] it is and they're teaching you about a
[1:04:51] trinity and that when you're baptized
[1:04:53] you baptize in the name of the father
[1:04:55] and of the the son and of the Holy
[1:04:57] Spirit and you're just sitting there and
[1:04:58] you're going wait a minute here the name
[1:05:01] of the father and of the son and of the
[1:05:04] holy spirit is Jesus Christ that's why
[1:05:08] when Jesus stood there and he rose he
[1:05:10] had just risen from the dead and he he
[1:05:12] come to his disciples he said go into
[1:05:14] all
[1:05:15] nations but listen what he said before
[1:05:17] that he says all power has been given
[1:05:20] unto me now if he's got all the power
[1:05:23] where's the father's power
[1:05:26] he said all power in heaven and on Earth
[1:05:30] you're looking at you're looking at the
[1:05:32] Supreme
[1:05:34] deity he that created the heavens and
[1:05:37] the Earth he that there was no one
[1:05:39] before him no one after him no one
[1:05:41] beside him the scripture even says not
[1:05:44] even a savior because I am the savior he
[1:05:48] says amen he's he was standing there the
[1:05:51] supreme authority of God and he says all
[1:05:55] power has been given unto me so now you
[1:05:57] need to go out into the world baptizing
[1:06:01] them in the
[1:06:03] name he didn't say names he said in the
[1:06:06] name of the father and of the son and of
[1:06:09] the Holy Spirit and those disciples were
[1:06:11] sitting right there and Peter knew
[1:06:13] exactly what he was saying he says yes
[1:06:16] Lord that name is Jesus Christ and
[1:06:20] that's why on the day of Pentecost when
[1:06:22] they asked Peter what must we do to be
[1:06:24] saved and a lot of people will ask you
[1:06:27] when you're out there and you're a
[1:06:28] living testimony of this word if the
[1:06:30] ABCs aren't right they're not going to
[1:06:32] start right they're not going to end
[1:06:34] right and they turn and they say you how
[1:06:37] well what what do I need to do I tell
[1:06:39] them straight up I said you need to
[1:06:42] repent from your
[1:06:45] unbelief wh what unbelief the the fact
[1:06:48] that you believe in the traditions of
[1:06:51] your church in the teachings of your
[1:06:53] ministers in the in the tradition s of
[1:06:56] of men that have lived for hundreds of
[1:06:58] years and they're teaching these
[1:07:00] doctrines of the Trinity and everything
[1:07:01] else you need to repent of all of that
[1:07:05] and then you need to be baptized
[1:07:07] properly in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:10] Christ for the remission of your
[1:07:14] unbelief that's why you get buried and
[1:07:16] you start a brand new life and that
[1:07:19] starts you on the right foot amen that
[1:07:22] gets you started right now God is is
[1:07:25] obligated according to his word he says
[1:07:28] you're baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:07:30] Jesus Christ and what does it say in
[1:07:32] Acts 238 and you shall receive the
[1:07:36] token you shall receive your seal which
[1:07:41] is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost
[1:07:44] will seal you and fill you and now when
[1:07:49] you're filled with the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:50] you go back to read that word you're
[1:07:52] going to see the word and you're going
[1:07:54] to read the word in a different light Al
[1:07:57] together it's going to be a brand new
[1:07:59] Bible to
[1:08:00] you your whole experience is going to be
[1:08:03] completely different everything around
[1:08:06] you will be completely different you
[1:08:07] will see that Jesus what he meant by the
[1:08:11] truth shall set you free amen praise God
[1:08:16] and so we're talking about a Jubilee
[1:08:18] today we're talking about it's time for
[1:08:21] the Jubilee and it's time for some
[1:08:22] people that are still locked into
[1:08:25] tradition
[1:08:26] some people that are still locked into
[1:08:28] their mental attitudes of of how they
[1:08:31] see the word and how that the word that
[1:08:33] it's only the way that they see it it's
[1:08:35] not God is his own interpreter you want
[1:08:38] to really you you really want to see the
[1:08:40] word you need to humble yourself you
[1:08:43] need to allow the Holy Spirit to reveal
[1:08:45] to you in the
[1:08:47] Simplicity in his
[1:08:49] Simplicity what is real truth amen
[1:08:52] Leviticus 23:27 next slide says says
[1:08:56] also on the 10th day of this seventh
[1:08:58] month there shall be a day of atonement
[1:09:02] it shall be an holy convocation unto you
[1:09:05] and you shall afflict your souls and
[1:09:08] offer an offering made by fire unto the
[1:09:11] Lord listen you know what that offering
[1:09:14] by fire is it's a deep call to the Deep
[1:09:18] am it's the Holy Ghost in you it's now
[1:09:21] the Life of Christ in you now you're
[1:09:24] offering back the Revelation that you
[1:09:27] are a son or a daughter of God because
[1:09:30] the fire of God is what's now being
[1:09:33] offered back to the Lord without faith
[1:09:36] you can never please the lord it's not
[1:09:38] about listen to them they had to bring a
[1:09:41] an offering and and they had to put the
[1:09:43] blood on the altar they had to they had
[1:09:46] to Slit the throat of the lamb and the
[1:09:48] life that was on that lamb they the
[1:09:51] Innocence they would accept it onto
[1:09:53] themselves and God would allow that and
[1:09:55] he's still to you know he's still uh
[1:09:58] because of Israel's
[1:10:00] blindness they remain under that that
[1:10:04] that's why they they they got to set up
[1:10:05] the temple they got to re they got to do
[1:10:08] the sacrifice they got to do the rituals
[1:10:11] to them that is what is going to bring
[1:10:13] God on the scene amen they they don't
[1:10:16] realize that that their blindness is
[1:10:18] going to be lifted and they're going to
[1:10:20] realize that that's not what's required
[1:10:23] that their blindness is going to bring
[1:10:25] bring them to an Awakening that their
[1:10:27] Messiah was Jesus
[1:10:29] Christ and then they're going to weep
[1:10:32] and they're going to whail and they're
[1:10:33] going to mourn saying
[1:10:35] oh where did you get those those those
[1:10:38] those you know Blood Stained hands with
[1:10:42] the you know with the with the scars on
[1:10:44] your hands and he says in the house of
[1:10:46] my friends in in in my own family I I
[1:10:49] was rejected by my own amen they're not
[1:10:52] going to realize but that's part of the
[1:10:55] Great Awakening that's all part of the
[1:10:58] Fulfillment of Prophecy amen praise God
[1:11:01] but we we receive the Holy Ghost because
[1:11:06] the life is not the life of a lamb on
[1:11:10] the altar it was the life of the Lamb of
[1:11:13] God who came to take away the sins of
[1:11:16] the world and went to the cross and when
[1:11:19] he bled he bled for you and for me amen
[1:11:24] you were in him when he went to the
[1:11:26] Cross you were a part of him when you
[1:11:28] when he went to the cross and everything
[1:11:31] all the Judgment all your sin everything
[1:11:34] that you lived as a sinner was nailed to
[1:11:38] the cross on that day on Calvary and you
[1:11:41] are now identifying with that and
[1:11:44] identifying you with the word for this
[1:11:47] hour because he's doing it now he's
[1:11:49] doing it again amen praise God and
[1:11:53] you're identifying with that so you're
[1:11:55] your offering that's made by fire is the
[1:11:58] offering of the Holy Ghost in your life
[1:12:02] when you come into the house of the Lord
[1:12:04] and you worship
[1:12:06] him that's the offering that has that
[1:12:09] has brought us into a revelation and a
[1:12:12] fellowship and a relationship with
[1:12:15] Christ
[1:12:16] himself amen praise God hallelujah next
[1:12:20] scripture I want you to notice in
[1:12:22] Leviticus it was the 10th day the 7th
[1:12:25] month Revelations 107 but in the days of
[1:12:29] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:12:32] shall begin to sound the mystery of God
[1:12:35] should be finished as he hath declared
[1:12:39] to his servants the prophets God does
[1:12:43] absolutely nothing without first
[1:12:46] revealing it unto his servants the
[1:12:48] prophets you show me one time where he
[1:12:51] ever did anything without a prophet when
[1:12:54] it came to Israel
[1:12:55] and God had to do it again in the 20th
[1:12:58] century amen because he made a promise
[1:13:02] according to his word in Malachi 4:5
[1:13:05] behold I send unto you personal Elijah
[1:13:10] the prophet and he's going to open your
[1:13:13] understanding he's going to give you a
[1:13:15] revelation on what you need to do in
[1:13:18] order to receive the Holy Ghost so that
[1:13:21] when the Holy Ghost comes on you it's
[1:13:24] going to turn you back to the word it's
[1:13:26] going to it's going to awaken you to the
[1:13:29] true Living God the the the the word of
[1:13:32] God for your day amen so God had to send
[1:13:35] us a prophet to reveal the
[1:13:39] mystery all the mystery listen we can't
[1:13:43] get into into everything but I I'm just
[1:13:45] going to tell you this all these feasts
[1:13:48] everything that we read from Genesis to
[1:13:51] Revelation it's all about One mystery
[1:13:56] yes one
[1:13:58] mystery God
[1:14:00] himself expressing himself in the story
[1:14:05] of redemption amen this is the plan for
[1:14:10] this day and for this hour and we're not
[1:14:13] to be confused and get distracted by all
[1:14:16] the teachings that you see on on on the
[1:14:19] on YouTube about oh the anunaki all the
[1:14:24] different you know civilizations that
[1:14:26] existed before you know this
[1:14:29] civilization 6,000 years people say to
[1:14:32] you oh you telling me the Bible's only
[1:14:34] 6,000 years old yeah the Bible is 6,000
[1:14:37] years old but God is
[1:14:39] eternal the Bible in Genesis said in the
[1:14:42] beginning Elohim the self-existent one
[1:14:46] period period it didn't say how old he
[1:14:50] was it didn't say how he started it
[1:14:52] didn't say anything it said
[1:14:53] self-existence so listen civilizations
[1:14:57] sure there was other civilizations
[1:14:59] there's proof right on the earth that
[1:15:02] there was other civilizations yes sir
[1:15:05] but that's got nothing to do with us
[1:15:08] today see people get distracted they
[1:15:10] want to they want to say oh no no we
[1:15:13] we're you're only going back 6,000
[1:15:16] years and you're a
[1:15:18] preacher I can take you back 200 million
[1:15:21] years and tell you that there was
[1:15:24] dinosaurs
[1:15:26] I say okay what good is a dinosaur going
[1:15:30] to do me
[1:15:32] now what good is it to know that there
[1:15:34] was cavemen here a 100 million years ago
[1:15:38] you tell me what good that
[1:15:40] is when I see the prophecy that's going
[1:15:43] on out there according to this Bible and
[1:15:47] if you take the time to read the Old
[1:15:49] Testament and read about Israel in the
[1:15:51] Old Testament you will find things in
[1:15:54] there that you will your your eyes are
[1:15:56] going to open but only if God opens your
[1:15:59] understanding to believe what you're
[1:16:01] reading cuz a lot of people think it's
[1:16:03] just stories oh David and Goliath yeah
[1:16:06] it's a great
[1:16:08] story it's more than a story to a son or
[1:16:10] a daughter of
[1:16:12] God it shows that God was with that that
[1:16:16] that individual and and it it tells me
[1:16:19] that when I'm in my weakest moments at
[1:16:21] times when I'm facing some great Giants
[1:16:24] in my life
[1:16:25] when I got to overcome some serious
[1:16:27] situations whether it's sickness or
[1:16:30] whether it's heartache or whatever it is
[1:16:32] that I've got a God that can put faith
[1:16:35] into my hand and I can take that faith f
[1:16:39] AI t h 5 stones and I can believe in
[1:16:43] Jesus j s s who is my savior and I can
[1:16:47] apply that word into that situation and
[1:16:51] and that power's got to be
[1:16:53] broken I can be I can conquer what it is
[1:16:56] that I'm facing amen and nobody can tell
[1:16:59] me what's going on in the Middle East is
[1:17:02] just a
[1:17:03] story it's a reality what's going on out
[1:17:06] there all the players all the
[1:17:08] individuals from from from Israel and
[1:17:12] their and their families to the to the
[1:17:14] Iranians to the to the uh uh he all the
[1:17:18] the the proxies of of of the the Iran
[1:17:22] government that that that have they up
[1:17:25] all these proxies Hamas and Hezbollah
[1:17:28] that are trying and have only one goal
[1:17:30] and that is to annihilate the nation of
[1:17:33] Israel well that's that's all in the
[1:17:36] scripture we're going to see some of
[1:17:38] that scripture as we go through this
[1:17:40] little series here that how it is that
[1:17:42] that it's a reality that's taking place
[1:17:45] and we are witnessing it and that's why
[1:17:48] it's important for you and everybody
[1:17:52] else that that that listens in when we
[1:17:54] preach preach about Jesus Christ and
[1:17:56] prophetic events for you to study the
[1:18:00] word of God it's the story the Bible is
[1:18:03] the is the
[1:18:05] playbook for what is going on what has
[1:18:08] happened and what is going to happen
[1:18:11] amen and you have a part of it because
[1:18:15] you're here on Earth you're in a human
[1:18:18] vessel and as long as you're here in a
[1:18:21] human vessel you're going to have to
[1:18:22] deal with these prophecies just like
[1:18:25] those that are dealing with it in Israel
[1:18:27] dealing it in Lebanon dealing with it in
[1:18:30] Gaza those bombs are real bombs they're
[1:18:32] blowing up real people families are
[1:18:35] being destroyed families are being
[1:18:37] murdered families are being listen these
[1:18:39] things are actually happening Saints and
[1:18:42] so people they want to get all oh but I
[1:18:46] listen you know these civilizations that
[1:18:48] took place before and you know these
[1:18:51] things that happened before you know uh
[1:18:55] you know we're not we're we're not going
[1:18:57] to be affected by what's going on on the
[1:19:00] earth you're being affected whether you
[1:19:03] like it or
[1:19:04] not those plagues that the Bible talks
[1:19:07] about those wars and rumors of wars
[1:19:11] those catastrophic natural disasters
[1:19:14] that we deal with every single year and
[1:19:17] they get worse and worse they're real
[1:19:20] they're happening don't tell me they're
[1:19:22] not happening so you need to search
[1:19:25] yourself you need to
[1:19:27] reboot your thinking and get away from
[1:19:31] all this this other thinking about past
[1:19:33] civilizations and everything else and
[1:19:35] try to become an historian and try to
[1:19:38] make yourself more knowledgeable than
[1:19:40] the word of
[1:19:41] God you need to humble yourself to God's
[1:19:44] word and what he says is going to happen
[1:19:47] amen and so we know that there's a
[1:19:49] mystery that's going on in this day and
[1:19:52] in this hour and that mystery is the
[1:19:54] story of Jesus Christ the Savior the
[1:19:59] Redeemer the one that started this plan
[1:20:02] and is going to end this plan and we're
[1:20:05] going to go into one thou because the
[1:20:07] Bible's got a 7,000 year game plan
[1:20:11] Saints and we are on the verge of the
[1:20:15] last thousand years of what's going to
[1:20:19] what the game plan says for this
[1:20:22] Earth then there's going to be a new
[1:20:24] heavens and a new Earth and then maybe a
[1:20:27] new plan whatever it is you got to do
[1:20:31] something so you might as well recognize
[1:20:34] that if you're a part of that Eternal
[1:20:36] plan then your life doesn't end when you
[1:20:40] die here on this Earth in this flesh you
[1:20:43] go to realize and recognize that you go
[1:20:45] beyond this life you're Eternal you'll
[1:20:48] have no end because you are a son or a
[1:20:50] daughter of God because a son or a
[1:20:53] daughter is is a is a part of God it's
[1:20:57] an expression of God and that if you're
[1:21:00] an expression of God you have no
[1:21:02] Beginning No End you have experience
[1:21:05] here on this Earth in this human vessel
[1:21:09] but that is only an experience here on
[1:21:11] Earth you need to find out what the plan
[1:21:14] is for you to get out of this trap of
[1:21:18] this Earth because the plan it doesn't
[1:21:22] it doesn't get better here on Earth it's
[1:21:23] going to get worse verse
[1:21:25] first hallelujah praise God and so the
[1:21:29] next
[1:21:30] scripture pertains to now we know that
[1:21:33] Revelations 10 1-7 pertains to William
[1:21:37] Branham the
[1:21:38] messenger that would come and restore
[1:21:42] Malachi 4:5 to turn the hearts of the
[1:21:44] children back to the faith of the
[1:21:45] fathers you need to research and and and
[1:21:49] find out about the ministry of William
[1:21:52] Branham and just like when you type
[1:21:55] Jesus Christ into this into Google
[1:21:58] you're going to find out that there's
[1:22:00] Satan worshippers too and they're
[1:22:02] against Christ they're against
[1:22:05] everything that he did he didn't die for
[1:22:07] your sins according to them he he's not
[1:22:10] the Savior according to them and so
[1:22:13] you're going to read things when you
[1:22:14] research about Martin Luther John Wesley
[1:22:18] Pentecostal experience and William Bram
[1:22:21] Billy Graham Oral Roberts these these
[1:22:24] were all men of God that had Ministries
[1:22:29] over the over the in in the 19th 20th
[1:22:31] century amen that fulfilled portions of
[1:22:35] Prophecy according to the word of God
[1:22:39] and so you need to realize that yes
[1:22:41] you're going to see you know the first
[1:22:42] day somebody says oh I looked up William
[1:22:44] brandham and they call him a
[1:22:49] cult I can show you a hundred
[1:22:52] Cults what is that God to do with your
[1:22:55] ability to search the scriptures
[1:22:59] yourself what about you searching the
[1:23:01] scriptures and finding out for yourself
[1:23:05] because that's where you're going to
[1:23:06] come to realize who he really is and if
[1:23:10] you and if and if it's not given unto
[1:23:13] you to know it guess what you'll never
[1:23:16] see
[1:23:17] it Saints we got to realize Jesus said
[1:23:21] unto you it has been given to know the
[1:23:23] mysteries of the
[1:23:25] Kingdom but look he says because the
[1:23:27] disciples asked why are they leaving
[1:23:28] because unto them it has not been given
[1:23:33] it's not given to the serpent seed it's
[1:23:36] not given to the children of
[1:23:39] Disobedience it's not given to the
[1:23:41] enemy's children because they're the
[1:23:44] enemy we need to realize that listen if
[1:23:46] oh no there isn't a devil there is a
[1:23:49] devil okay you tell me what's causing
[1:23:52] those people out there to murder those
[1:23:54] children and rape those women and do all
[1:23:56] of those things that's not God that's
[1:23:59] not God that's that's of the enemy
[1:24:02] there's a devil that's anointing those
[1:24:04] people to do those things amen this is
[1:24:07] the plan of Good and Evil Saints it's
[1:24:09] all part of the game plan we need to
[1:24:12] come into the game plan recognize where
[1:24:14] we fit in what our position is and what
[1:24:16] it is that God wants us to do amen amen
[1:24:20] praise God and in Revelations 108-111 it
[1:24:23] says and The Voice which I heard from
[1:24:25] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[1:24:28] and take the little book which is open
[1:24:31] in the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:24:34] upon the sea and upon the Earth and we
[1:24:36] know that it was Christ that stepped out
[1:24:39] of the throne it's Christ that stepped
[1:24:41] out in in in in Revelations 10:1 when he
[1:24:44] put one foot on the land and one foot on
[1:24:46] the sea and said time shall be no more
[1:24:49] that was Christ coming down in our
[1:24:53] generation Amen to fulfill scripture
[1:24:56] praise God but now he held a book and
[1:25:00] that book contained the names of
[1:25:03] everyone that would come to the
[1:25:06] revelation of the true body of Jesus
[1:25:09] Christ those that were in the body of
[1:25:12] Christ those that were with him before
[1:25:14] the foundations of the world this plan
[1:25:17] goes before the foundations of the world
[1:25:20] Amen that's what you need to recognize
[1:25:22] because God is eternal and he's got your
[1:25:25] name written in that book so that you
[1:25:28] will come to the realization of who you
[1:25:31] really are so he tells him now he says
[1:25:33] now take that
[1:25:35] book so he says and said unto me give me
[1:25:38] the little book and he said unto me take
[1:25:40] it and eat it up and it shall make thy
[1:25:43] belly bitter but it shall be in thy
[1:25:45] mouth sweet as honey and I took the
[1:25:48] little book out of the Angel's hand and
[1:25:50] ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet
[1:25:53] as honey oh the word of God is so sweet
[1:25:56] but when you got to live it that's a
[1:25:57] different ball game altogether and when
[1:25:59] you've got to prophesy it and as soon as
[1:26:01] I had eaten it my belly was bitter and
[1:26:04] he said unto me thou must prophesy again
[1:26:08] before many peoples and Nations and
[1:26:11] tongues and Kings who's he talking about
[1:26:14] there I'm going to tell you that this is
[1:26:17] the ministry of the church for this
[1:26:20] hour this is the ministry that we've
[1:26:23] been given in this hour that that that
[1:26:26] the word that God has given to us that
[1:26:28] we've come to realize and recognize by
[1:26:31] the opening of the scriptures and by you
[1:26:33] having a true Born Again experience in
[1:26:36] the Lord you become an instrument of the
[1:26:41] Holy Ghost you become a voice in this
[1:26:45] last generation you become one that's a
[1:26:48] carrier that's going to let the people
[1:26:50] know remember we have a purpose remember
[1:26:53] this is the jub
[1:26:55] this is our time of Jubilee there's a
[1:26:57] lot of people that are still they're
[1:26:59] they're they're still locked in under
[1:27:01] their slave master under their
[1:27:04] traditional denominational teaching
[1:27:07] Master they're still under that slave
[1:27:09] master and yet they remain there because
[1:27:12] they have not heard the word of
[1:27:15] truth but we are the carriers of the
[1:27:18] word of Truth amen we are the ones that
[1:27:20] are now in this hour the carriers of the
[1:27:23] prophecy
[1:27:25] the ones that will speak the word of God
[1:27:27] and and see lives being transformed by
[1:27:30] the word of God Amen we're the ones that
[1:27:33] God has given the the the the
[1:27:35] responsibility to let the people know
[1:27:37] how it is that they are going to come in
[1:27:40] because the Gentile dispensation it's
[1:27:43] coming to an end it's ending Saints
[1:27:46] we've got to we've got to do our part
[1:27:48] we've got to share the word of God we've
[1:27:50] got to let the people know what the
[1:27:52] truth is amen praise God listen to The
[1:27:55] Prophet here in the Feast of trumpets he
[1:27:58] says the Holy Spirit has been bound in
[1:28:02] these denominational Rivers for almost
[1:28:05] 2,000 years but it's to be loosed in the
[1:28:08] evening time the evening time is the end
[1:28:11] time Saints this is what D Daniel was
[1:28:14] talking about when he said that these
[1:28:16] things were sealed up until the end but
[1:28:18] now we're in the end the wise shall know
[1:28:22] what is it that we know pay ATT
[1:28:24] attention he says the Holy Spirit he
[1:28:27] says this to be loosed in the evening
[1:28:30] time by the end time
[1:28:33] message so you mean there's a there's a
[1:28:35] message in this day that's going to set
[1:28:39] so-called
[1:28:40] Christians free to actually be birthed
[1:28:44] by the word of
[1:28:46] God you mean they need to be born
[1:28:49] again a lot of them say I was born
[1:28:52] again well what were you born
[1:28:55] to you need to check what it is that you
[1:28:58] were birthed to were you born again
[1:29:03] according to God's word or did you just
[1:29:06] answer an altar call go there as a as a
[1:29:10] sinner uh you know crying and and
[1:29:13] leaving and going right back into sin or
[1:29:15] did you actually receive the Holy
[1:29:18] Ghost there's a
[1:29:21] difference so there's a there's an end
[1:29:23] time message the Holy Spirit back in the
[1:29:25] church again Christ himself revealed in
[1:29:30] human flesh in the evening time how many
[1:29:34] believes that Christ is
[1:29:37] here a lot of people are still putting
[1:29:39] them off oh he's going to come in the
[1:29:41] clouds and we're going to see him and
[1:29:43] we're going to go and meet him in the
[1:29:45] air guess what he's already here 1963 he
[1:29:49] came down in a cloud on Sunset mountain
[1:29:53] and and his head was coming to join the
[1:29:56] body you need to do your research to
[1:29:58] find that he's already come and you
[1:30:01] didn't know it he's going to take one
[1:30:03] out of the bed he's going to leave the
[1:30:05] other this has been happening since
[1:30:09] 1963 to call out the the church the
[1:30:12] portion of the body of Christ that was
[1:30:15] ordained for this
[1:30:17] hour amen there's been a church through
[1:30:20] every age Luther Wesley let's read on
[1:30:23] here he says here Christ himself
[1:30:25] revealed in human flesh in the evening
[1:30:28] time he said he promised it now there
[1:30:30] was three stages of it as I said the
[1:30:33] martyr's age for it and then the stage
[1:30:37] of the reformers we know the Dark Ages
[1:30:39] was all the martyrs that they died they
[1:30:41] had to give their lives for the for the
[1:30:43] gospel you know that was the martyrs age
[1:30:46] and then come the Reformation which was
[1:30:48] you know the calling out time reformers
[1:30:51] and now the calling out when finished at
[1:30:53] Leo Dean age according to Revelation 10
[1:30:56] which we just read the mystery of all
[1:30:59] the Bible would be known to the bride is
[1:31:03] that right amen Revelation 10 listen
[1:31:06] close now uh-huh bride called out by the
[1:31:12] word not called out by a tradition not
[1:31:15] oh come and join my church you know we
[1:31:18] believe that the Lord is
[1:31:19] coming and then they'll tell you oh you
[1:31:22] can be baptized in the name of the
[1:31:23] father father and the son and of the
[1:31:24] Holy Spirit and we believe in a trinity
[1:31:28] Jesus Christ is the Son of God and then
[1:31:31] there's God the father and then there's
[1:31:32] the Holy Spirit these are all three
[1:31:35] separate entities but yet they are in
[1:31:37] one they
[1:31:39] agree you
[1:31:41] see they're deceived and they don't know
[1:31:45] it how can you worship that whom you do
[1:31:48] not
[1:31:49] know amen is that right so goes on he
[1:31:54] says he says the bride called out by the
[1:31:56] word Christ himself calling out the
[1:31:58] bride making plain Hebrews 13:8 that
[1:32:02] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:32:03] forever does the same is the same he
[1:32:07] that believeth on me the works that I do
[1:32:10] shall he do also Luke 22 Luke 17:30 also
[1:32:15] Malachi 4 you see he's making it plain
[1:32:18] to the people the hour that they're
[1:32:21] living in that they need to recognize
[1:32:24] amen all these scriptures that's
[1:32:26] promised this is to be between the sixth
[1:32:30] and the seventh seal and the sixth and
[1:32:32] the seventh trumpet Pentecostal Feast
[1:32:35] finishes at the period of the seventh
[1:32:37] trumpet for the next is the coming of
[1:32:40] the seventh seal now brother brandham
[1:32:43] was at that time where he where where he
[1:32:46] came into the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:32:49] we've recognized that the seals are now
[1:32:51] open the trumpets to to Israel is the
[1:32:55] Seven Seals the seven trumpets to Israel
[1:32:58] is the seven Trumpets the Seven Seals to
[1:33:00] the
[1:33:01] bride the Seven Seals have been opened
[1:33:04] in this day and in this hour people are
[1:33:07] going into churches and they read the
[1:33:10] book of Revelation and they'll go right
[1:33:12] over the Seven Seals and when you ask
[1:33:15] them about it they'll say we don't
[1:33:17] understand it we don't know what it
[1:33:20] means well then you need to listen to to
[1:33:24] God's Vindicated prophet of Malachi
[1:33:27] 4:5 the the the the messenger that came
[1:33:31] into the 20th century that was God's
[1:33:34] Prophet to come and unveil the word and
[1:33:37] open the word so that you could
[1:33:39] understand but it's still going to
[1:33:41] require for you to come into your own
[1:33:44] experience with God you're going to have
[1:33:47] to come God's provided way first listen
[1:33:49] I tell everybody right from the
[1:33:51] beginning when I came into this message
[1:33:55] I did not come in because God showed me
[1:33:58] William brandham was the prophet of the
[1:34:00] hour no sir God showed me that I was a
[1:34:04] Son of God and that he was God that he
[1:34:07] was my deliverer that he he was my
[1:34:09] healer that he was a living God that he
[1:34:12] was an everpresent God that that that I
[1:34:14] could look and and feel and touch amen
[1:34:18] because my life had been
[1:34:20] transformed then my understanding and
[1:34:22] the revelation brought me to a place
[1:34:24] where I want to get baptized I want the
[1:34:27] Holy Ghost I realize I need the holy
[1:34:29] ghost that experience can never be
[1:34:32] bypass
[1:34:33] Saints that's why when you're when
[1:34:35] you're testifying to somebody you want
[1:34:37] to share a track you want to tell them
[1:34:38] about the prophet but before all of that
[1:34:41] you need to lead them to Christ they
[1:34:43] need to know him in the power of his
[1:34:46] resurrection they need to know that he's
[1:34:48] a reality that can heal them that can
[1:34:50] that can set them free from the bondage
[1:34:52] of melt mental illness that can liberate
[1:34:55] them from from broken relationships that
[1:34:58] can set them free from the from the
[1:35:00] anxieties of this world that he's a real
[1:35:03] true Living God and once they've had
[1:35:05] that experience they're going to
[1:35:08] listen they're going to listen they're
[1:35:10] going to say Oh Glory to God what else
[1:35:12] and now he starts to unveil all of these
[1:35:15] mysteries in the word of God to let you
[1:35:17] know that hey you are my bride you're my
[1:35:19] wife you're the one that I've chosen
[1:35:22] you're I've given you the understanding
[1:35:24] you're one of those sheep that hear my
[1:35:26] voice and it excites you it allows you
[1:35:29] to transform your own personal life now

[1:36:07] William Branham we are an organization
[1:36:11] that worships Jesus Christ in the
[1:36:13] present stage of his ministry amen we've
[1:36:18] recognized William brandom as a prophet
[1:36:21] to the 20th century just like the
[1:36:23] children of Israel recognize that Moses
[1:36:25] was their deliverer amen just like they
[1:36:29] recognize Ezekiel they recognize Isaiah
[1:36:32] they recognized Jeremiah they recognized
[1:36:35] all the prophets that when they came and
[1:36:37] said thus sayeth the Lord this is what
[1:36:41] the Lord says about my people this is
[1:36:44] what the Lord wants from my people when
[1:36:48] when when God does something like that
[1:36:50] it changes
[1:36:51] everything but you need to come to
[1:36:54] realize that that's what makes him the

[1:38:00] that I got delivered by the word of
[1:38:04] God by the supernatural Revelation that
[1:38:08] Jesus Christ is a reality in my life and
[1:38:13] until that happens in your life you're
[1:38:16] bound by denomination you're bound by
[1:38:18] teachings of man you're looking to your
[1:38:20] doctrines you're not looking to the word
[1:38:24] which is Christ in the power of his
[1:38:26] resurrection amen now listen here he

[1:38:31] finishes at the period of the seventh
[1:38:33] trumpet for the next is the coming of
[1:38:36] the seventh seal for the next is the
[1:38:38] mystery of the coming of Christ we know

[1:39:56] out from right here to call Sons and
[1:40:01] Daughters to the attention of the word
[1:40:04] for this day and for this hour to reject
[1:40:09] the word of God is to stay under the
[1:40:13] Taskmaster it was after 50 years every
[1:40:16] 50 years the children of Israel would
[1:40:19] sound the chauffeur and they call it the
[1:40:21] trumpet of Jubilee where the children of
[1:40:24] Israel if they were in slavery or if
[1:40:27] they were sold to a Taskmaster that they
[1:40:31] had to be released they were free they
[1:40:34] could be set free to leave those
[1:40:37] taskmasters and never look back to them
[1:40:40] again but if they chose to reject and to
[1:40:45] stay under those task Masters under

[1:42:32] Messiah the Bible said them striking
[1:42:35] things like this would take place Amen
[1:42:39] in Revelations 11 call their ministry
[1:42:42] will be the ministry of Moses and Elias
[1:42:45] calling to
[1:42:46] Israel out of the TR Jewish
[1:42:50] Traditions just as the seventh Angel's
[1:42:52] message
[1:42:53] called The Bride out of the Pentecostal
[1:42:57] tradition remember Moses and Elijah is
[1:43:00] to call Israel out of the old atonement
[1:43:03] of the lamb and sheep and blood and
[1:43:06] goats and sacrifice to the Real Living
[1:43:09] Sacrifice to the word and the seventh
[1:43:12] Angel's message under the same trumpet
[1:43:15] same everything exactly the same seal is
[1:43:19] to what call the people the bride out of
[1:43:23] the Pentecostal traditions and World
[1:43:27] Traditions to the genuine atonement of
[1:43:31] the word Christ impersonated in his word
[1:43:36] here made flesh Among Us science has
[1:43:40] proved it by pictures the church knows
[1:43:43] it the world around we firmly know it
[1:43:46] for he's never told us one thing in thus
[1:43:50] sayeth the Lord but what's been the
[1:43:52] truth
[1:43:53] did he not say down there on the river
[1:43:56] as John the Baptist was sent forth uh so
[1:44:01] this
[1:44:02] message William branham's message was to
[1:44:05] forerun the second coming of Jesus
[1:44:08] Christ amen the second coming of Jesus
[1:44:11] Christ took place for the church under
[1:44:15] the opening of The Seven
[1:44:17] Seals when that seventh seal was
[1:44:20] released and opened there was no no
[1:44:23] interpretation given but yet the
[1:44:25] scripture says in Revelations uh 8
[1:44:29] that there was a half hour of Silence in
[1:44:34] heaven which means that somehow he left
[1:44:38] the throne he was coming down to meet
[1:44:42] with his church he was now coming down
[1:44:46] to call his elected into the body of
[1:44:49] Jesus Christ amen and we know that this
[1:44:52] has already happened we are the living
[1:44:55] testimony of that scripture being
[1:44:58] fulfilled here in
[1:45:00] 2024 we have received our opening of the
[1:45:04] seventh seal and Jesus Christ has come
[1:45:08] to
[1:45:09] dwell to
[1:45:11] possess to anoint a five-fold Ministry
[1:45:15] to speak to his children to to to so
[1:45:18] that you will know that greater is he
[1:45:20] that is in you because the at is Christ
[1:45:23] it's the holy ghost coming into your
[1:45:26] life so that you can overcome the the
[1:45:29] the the challenges that you're dealing
[1:45:30] with the circumstances that you're
[1:45:32] overcoming in this life without that
[1:45:35] true experience you cannot
[1:45:38] overcome the true Overcomer has come to
[1:45:41] realize that it's he that is in you he's
[1:45:44] the Overcomer he's the one that's going
[1:45:46] to deliver he's the one that's going to
[1:45:48] open your understanding give you an
[1:45:51] understanding he's the one that's to
[1:45:53] translate you if the same spirit that
[1:45:56] raised Christ from the dead dwell in you
[1:46:01] it's going to Quicken this body it's
[1:46:03] going to it's going to it's going to
[1:46:04] give it an interdimensional change in a
[1:46:08] moment and in the twinkling of an eye
[1:46:10] that it can only be possible because you
[1:46:14] have recognized that Christ has
[1:46:18] come we're not looking for his coming
[1:46:22] he's already already
[1:46:23] come he's W in us he's with us what
[1:46:27] we're waiting for is for that call to go
[1:46:29] to the meeting in the air but he's
[1:46:32] already here and he's called The Jubilee
[1:46:36] and those that have heard the sound of
[1:46:38] the trumpet sound of the Jubilee have
[1:46:41] gathered around the carcass where the
[1:46:43] Eagles gather around the Living Word not
[1:46:46] some man-made teaching not some oh you
[1:46:49] got to say 10 hell marries you got to
[1:46:51] say 20 what good is that going to do you
[1:46:55] when you're just repeating the scripture
[1:46:57] says don't come to me with your
[1:46:58] repetitive
[1:47:00] prayers but come to me with a sincere
[1:47:03] heart come to me with your broken heart
[1:47:05] from your come to me in your weakness
[1:47:08] when come to me in your humility and
[1:47:11] allow me to come and possess you and
[1:47:14] take control of you and love you and and
[1:47:17] and keep you through the enemy's
[1:47:20] fight Hallelujah glory to God amen he
[1:47:23] says now he says those seven sabbaths is
[1:47:27] the seven Church
[1:47:29] ages the church we've come through the
[1:47:31] church ages we realized the church age
[1:47:34] that that that we came through which was
[1:47:36] to Leo deia this is the Leo to see an
[1:47:39] age that we're now in and we can see its
[1:47:42] condition all around us but not you who
[1:47:45] have been called into the mystical Body
[1:47:47] of Christ by the opening of the word to
[1:47:51] you personal where you have now applied
[1:47:54] the token in your life you've you've
[1:47:56] allowed the blood of Christ to come upon
[1:47:58] your life through obedience to the word
[1:48:01] of
[1:48:02] God not not you have to do it no listen
[1:48:07] when go when you get sincere enough
[1:48:09] before God God will come to you God will
[1:48:13] heal you God will will will woo you God
[1:48:15] will will will love you and and cherish
[1:48:18] your you and love you and and when when
[1:48:21] he when when you come into that kind of
[1:48:23] an experience then then you you want
[1:48:25] more of him that's why I couldn't get
[1:48:27] enough I said I need the Holy Ghost I
[1:48:30] need more I need more not realizing that
[1:48:33] the Holy Ghost is what led me to get
[1:48:36] more is because there was representation
[1:48:38] now this is the other aspect that we
[1:48:40] need to understand there's people in
[1:48:43] those denominations in those Traditions
[1:48:46] that have an attribute of God in them
[1:48:51] Hall this is what must be
[1:48:54] recognized you can't come unless he
[1:48:57] calls you to come but what you can do is
[1:49:01] surrender to the call some people just
[1:49:05] they just want to stay stubborn they
[1:49:08] don't want to allow God to come into
[1:49:10] their entire life so that they so that
[1:49:13] he can Purge out all the
[1:49:16] unbelief we've got to say yes Lord
[1:49:19] remember he gave us free moral agency
[1:49:21] he's not going to force himself a man
[1:49:24] that forces himself onto a woman that
[1:49:27] woman will immediately reject
[1:49:29] him immediately reject him but that man
[1:49:34] that that that shows respect and love
[1:49:37] and and and and and and honors the
[1:49:41] individual shows them how important they
[1:49:44] are shows them that that's not the life
[1:49:47] that the life that they lived uh I'm
[1:49:49] making a way for you to to be completely
[1:49:52] free from that life it's like the story
[1:49:54] of you know of of uh the princess you
[1:49:58] know the the one that that gets the
[1:49:59] slipper you know she's living a life and
[1:50:02] she's she's the one that's you know been
[1:50:04] you know in poverty and everything else
[1:50:06] and then he's you know Prince Charming
[1:50:08] he comes along and he shows that no
[1:50:10] you're the chosen one he saw a character
[1:50:12] he saw humility he saw something there
[1:50:16] that that that attracted him you want
[1:50:18] the Holy Ghost more in your life you
[1:50:20] need to you need to humble yourself you
[1:50:23] need to you need to let go of all the
[1:50:25] pride and all the things that you want
[1:50:27] to hold on to I know this I know that
[1:50:29] you know nothing let the Holy Spirit
[1:50:32] show you wisdom let him show you
[1:50:34] humility let him show you what it is you
[1:50:37] know to to to love somebody that's
[1:50:39] that's lost to love somebody that's
[1:50:42] that's that's Bound by certain you know
[1:50:44] sin and unbelief show the love of God
[1:50:47] projecting the love of God into that
[1:50:49] situation I've always said you know when
[1:50:52] when when there there's when there's a
[1:50:53] fight and there's and there's an
[1:50:55] argument between two people the stronger
[1:50:59] one will be the
[1:51:02] Victor if he shows that he's the
[1:51:06] weakest in his attitude in in
[1:51:10] his he he he'll be the vi the the
[1:51:13] stronger one will be the one that says
[1:51:15] no more doesn't have to have the last
[1:51:18] word the stronger one will be the one
[1:51:21] that humbles and allows the Holy Spirit
[1:51:24] to be the absolute in the situation my
[1:51:29] my boss fired
[1:51:31] me I gave him a piece of my
[1:51:34] mind I told him you this do and gave him
[1:51:38] a few words and made sure he knew
[1:51:40] exactly what what what I was thinking
[1:51:42] that just goes to show that you were the
[1:51:45] weaker
[1:51:46] one and God's looking at the character
[1:51:49] he's not looking at anything else he's
[1:51:50] looking at the character
[1:51:53] but how do you know if God you see if
[1:51:55] you had the right character and and and
[1:51:58] they let you go and you're and you're
[1:52:00] you're you're just looking to him you're
[1:52:03] you're looking to him you're looking to
[1:52:04] his plan his purpose his will how do you
[1:52:07] know that he didn't let you go because
[1:52:09] he's got another job that all of a
[1:52:10] sudden you're making $10 more an
[1:52:13] hour because he looks at your character
[1:52:17] he's still Jehovah Gyra he's going to
[1:52:19] provide your needs and if he's not
[1:52:22] providing in your needs it's because
[1:52:24] there's something in
[1:52:26] you something in you that is that is not
[1:52:30] believing God in that
[1:52:34] area I'm not giving a tenth of my
[1:52:37] earnings I work hard for
[1:52:41] that I'm not going to give it to look at
[1:52:43] the pastor he's driving a fancy car he's
[1:52:46] got this he's got that he doesn't need
[1:52:48] my money you got no revelation
[1:52:53] and you're missing the biggest aspect of
[1:52:56] your financial blessing with
[1:53:00] God because of Pride because of your
[1:53:04] interpretation on the word of God don't
[1:53:07] put your own interpretation on the word
[1:53:10] let God be the one who interprets your
[1:53:14] life and your life will interpret itself
[1:53:20] you won't need to tell anybody
[1:53:22] anybody that's going around saying oh
[1:53:24] look what God did for me God's doing
[1:53:26] this God's doing that God's doing this
[1:53:28] God's doing
[1:53:30] that give it a six months and you're
[1:53:32] going to see he's not going to be saying
[1:53:34] anything he's going to be saying oh God
[1:53:36] what did you do to
[1:53:39] me because Pride always comes before a
[1:53:43] fall and that's why when when when we
[1:53:46] really come to understand this
[1:53:48] call you
[1:53:50] didn't you re recognize that Jesus
[1:53:53] Christ has come in this hour is because
[1:53:56] God has opened your understanding amen
[1:54:00] and it doesn't make you any better than
[1:54:02] anybody else out there
[1:54:04] no we're God's elected people because he
[1:54:08] said so not because we chose it no not
[1:54:12] because we did something to deserve it
[1:54:15] remember let's go on
[1:54:18] here let's read
[1:54:20] on praise God
[1:54:23] listen brother brandom here 1963 says
[1:54:27] and we know that no not one turt not one
[1:54:31] jot shall in no wise ever pass from your
[1:54:36] word you said heavens and earth will
[1:54:39] pass away but my word shall not and you
[1:54:43] said except a man be born again of water
[1:54:46] and spirit he will in no wise enter into
[1:54:49] the kingdom I pray father that you'll
[1:54:52] speak to the hearts tonight just as this
[1:54:55] time let men and women think seriously
[1:54:58] just at this moment knowing
[1:55:02] that knowing that we're living in the
[1:55:06] closing hours Israel is in her Homeland
[1:55:10] the great calendar of God she is
[1:55:13] returning back looking where is the
[1:55:16] Messiah we know that when Joseph made
[1:55:19] himself known to his brothers that he
[1:55:22] dis dismissed the Gentiles from the
[1:55:25] courts his wife and children were in the
[1:55:29] palace there must be a taking away of
[1:55:32] the Gentile that Israel might be made
[1:55:37] known then there will come a time of a
[1:55:40] wailing and screaming and crying where
[1:55:44] did you get those scars he said in the
[1:55:46] hands of my friends from my friends I
[1:55:49] have got these scars in my hand and the
[1:55:52] house where he where he was really
[1:55:55] should be accepted where he should have
[1:55:57] been accepted when he makes himself
[1:55:59] known to Israel again God while the
[1:56:03] Gentiles has a chance may they repent
[1:56:06] quickly and come to you amen we're going
[1:56:11] to continue next week let the musicians
[1:56:13] come and we're going to be
[1:56:16] looking at
[1:56:19] how we can't be here
[1:56:22] when the Messiah makes himself
[1:56:26] known to
[1:56:30] Israel we are living in the closing
[1:56:34] moments of
[1:56:35] time look at
[1:56:38] Israel look at the
[1:56:41] battles look at the enemies that are
[1:56:44] surrounding them look at the Nations
[1:56:46] that are coming against
[1:56:49] them look at how this is all happening
[1:56:53] and it's happening right here and now in
[1:56:56] our day
[1:56:58] Saints look at how close we
[1:57:01] are to where God is going to remove this
[1:57:06] Gentile
[1:57:07] bride there's going to be a last sermon
[1:57:11] preached there's going to be a last
[1:57:13] sermon preached where anybody is going
[1:57:16] to have that opportunity to recognize
[1:57:19] the word and to come into Christ
[1:57:23] when the Gentile dispensation is going
[1:57:25] to be
[1:57:26] finished what hour are we living in how
[1:57:30] close are we to that moment in
[1:57:34] time let's examine ourselves the chofar
[1:57:38] has been blown today the purpose of the
[1:57:41] blowing of the chofar was also to draw
[1:57:44] the attention of the people to take a
[1:57:47] look at their
[1:57:48] experience to look at the chains that
[1:57:53] are circumstances around their lives to
[1:57:57] examine and see if they're under bondage
[1:58:01] of some traditional denominational
[1:58:04] teaching of
[1:58:06] man doctrines of
[1:58:09] man or are they actually walking with
[1:58:13] Christ
[1:58:16] himself the choice has to be made those
[1:58:19] that rejected the Jubilee
[1:58:23] they were
[1:58:25] given an all to bore a hole in their
[1:58:30] ear and when they said no I will
[1:58:34] stay with my
[1:58:36] Taskmaster they could never be set free
[1:58:40] again this is the time of Jubilee this
[1:58:43] is the time where we can be set free
[1:58:47] this is the time where if you are
[1:58:49] uncertain of God
