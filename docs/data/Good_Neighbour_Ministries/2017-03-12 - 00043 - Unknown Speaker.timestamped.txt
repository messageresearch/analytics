[1:49] cocoon you're not doing anything you're

[1:54] not you're just hanging there You're
[1:56] vulnerable some bird come and eat
[1:58] you right you could fall
[2:01] off you just we're in that stage Saints
[2:05] we're in that stage where there's a veil
[2:08] over the bride and nothing can touch you
[2:11] right now it's okay but it seems a
[2:13] little crazy going on in the world right
[2:15] now but you're you're you're just
[2:17] hanging there just for a little
[2:19] bit but I promise you there's an
[2:23] unveiling coming the midst Jesus Christ

[2:38] going to roll up and the most beautiful
[2:42] Monarch Wings Hallelujah you are royalty
[2:46] right the most beautiful wings are going
[2:48] to be showing up and they're already
[2:50] there they're already there it's just a
[2:52] matter of moments now we're getting very
[2:54] close amuah do you believe it so I don't
[2:58] doubt any of these people people's uh
[3:00] experiences uh but I can I can relate
[3:03] some to some of their some of the other
[3:05] impossibility and and difficulty to be
[3:07] accurate try to explain God's glory and
[3:10] his presence I want to share with you a
[3:11] couple of things and I'm going to go
[3:13] ahead and close but I was 6 years old
[3:15] when I was aware of God's
[3:17] presence um I I remember laying on my
[3:20] bed and just talking to
[3:23] God and some of you could relate to this
[3:25] when you were young like that or a
[3:27] little bit older but something happened
[3:28] to you in your life where you
[3:30] there was something that woke up in you
[3:32] and you just realize there has to be God
[3:34] there has to be there something there's
[3:36] some strange awareness in your life of
[3:39] of you're either missing something or
[3:41] you're missing someone and it's God and
[3:44] you might even try to satify that with
[3:46] alcohol with drugs with friends
[3:49] girlfriend boyfriend wife husband all
[3:51] kinds of things children and nothing
[3:54] satisfies nothing replaces it it's a
[3:57] deeper hunger it cannot be met by any
[4:00] other human
[4:01] me and it's so deep uh and it's so
[4:04] Indescribable but you sense that that's
[4:06] what it is so six years of age I just
[4:08] had that start to come out of me and I
[4:10] was being very strongly aware that God
[4:12] existed and I had these conversations
[4:13] every night before going to bed with God
[4:15] and I I never I prayed I mean we prayed
[4:17] we were kids we were taught to pray but
[4:19] it wasn't until I was 16 that I had a
[4:21] true experience of Salvation I remember
[4:23] we were at a convention and um in this
[4:26] uh big Rada end that we were at had what
[4:29] was called an arcade room they don't
[4:31] have that anymore but it was an arcade
[4:32] room you put quarters in and you play
[4:34] games which is great for a 16-year-old
[4:37] and all my friends the other ones that
[4:39] were in this church they were uh doing
[4:41] that with me but instead of spending our
[4:43] own money we figured out we found a way
[4:44] that you can pull the back off of the
[4:46] game the machine and scoop the quarters
[4:47] out of the box just
[4:53] easy danger oh I was on Dangerous Ground
[4:56] believe me and in order you know we we
[4:58] didn't think we were doing anything
[4:59] wrong
[5:01] now I guess not right we were hiding the
[5:04] quarters in Coke can so you have an
[5:06] empty Coke can you can put 72 quarters
[5:08] in
[5:12] there and so we were in the at the end
[5:14] of the second service where they were
[5:16] preparing for the whole
[5:17] entire U meetings and they said we want
[5:21] everybody to make a 100% commitment
[5:22] everybody in this congregation come on
[5:24] and pray at least 10 minutes come up and
[5:25] pray at least 10 minutes and that will
[5:28] really get us into the Revival that need
[5:29] to be so we all we passed a note back
[5:32] and forth all of us guys all right 10
[5:34] minutes let's go pray mom and dad will
[5:35] be happy then we'll go meet at the
[5:36] arcade
[5:39] room so we went up to this altar
[5:41] whatever we were praying and I was just
[5:43] sitting there praying and I looked at my
[5:44] watch 9 Minutes one more to
[5:46] go I wasn't praying I don't know what I
[5:48] was
[5:50] doing and it was in that last minute at
[5:53] 10
[5:55] minutes that something
[5:58] happen that is hard to describe but I
[6:01] could see Jesus on the
[6:04] cross you know here I was raised in a
[6:06] message my whole life but I don't
[6:08] remember hardly anything that was ever
[6:09] preached this is really something that
[6:11] happens to the kids the young people
[6:13] they actually don't really remember much
[6:14] of what's preached Sunday school is a
[6:16] good thing we didn't have Sunday school
[6:19] but I didn't remember what was but all I
[6:20] know is I experienced seeing Jesus on
[6:24] Calvary and my sins disrespecting my
[6:28] parents disobedience lying cheating
[6:30] doing all kinds of crazy stuff was
[6:32] coming off of me and going on to him he
[6:36] was becoming more burdened with the
[6:38] weight of it and in pain and suffering
[6:40] and crying out and I was becoming more
[6:43] relieved of all my
[6:45] sins it wasn't anything I was asking him
[6:48] to
[6:48] do it was just something he was
[6:52] doing amen and I cried and I I was there
[6:56] for four hours
[6:59] you know puddle of you know puddle he
[7:03] melted me
[7:05] down and uh and he changed me I I I
[7:08] received salvation right then and there
[7:12] listen sints you raise your kids in this
[7:14] message doesn't mean they're saved
[7:15] [Music]
[7:17] one that's right it's never changed they
[7:19] got to meet
[7:24] Jesus
[7:27] Hallelujah I forget who was it might
[7:29] have been Spurgeon it might have been
[7:30] somebody else might have been Moody but
[7:33] one of those guys was raised with with a
[7:35] mother who would they would eat their
[7:38] meal then have devotions and they would
[7:40] read the Bible and she would close the
[7:41] book and she would pray a usual a prayer
[7:45] but this one particular time she prayed
[7:46] when he was 7 years old she said Lord
[7:49] God that my son is 7 years old he's
[7:51] heard the gospel over and over and over
[7:53] again and she says and I know that if he
[7:57] rejects it I'm the one who will have to
[8:01] reject
[8:02] him and send him to hell she said I
[8:06] don't want to do that that would break
[8:08] my heart as a
[8:09] mother she said if I do have to do it
[8:13] may that time be brief I couldn't stand
[8:16] it for more than just a minute or even
[8:18] more and as she cried and wept before
[8:21] God this little seven-year-old began to
[8:23] weep and he gave his heart to the Lord
[8:25] Jesus right
[8:26] there I'll tell you what keeps people
[8:29] from hell is Mama's prayers oh am
[8:32] Daddy's
[8:33] prayers that's what does it
[8:36] Hallelujah so saved at 17 at 16 and uh
[8:40] unfortunately a year later there was
[8:42] there was some manipulation and some
[8:43] things going on within the ranks of the
[8:45] ministry um in in the church that we
[8:48] were at and it just it impacted my
[8:50] family in a negative way and um I I I
[8:54] walked away I walked away from the
[8:56] church but that led to walking away from
[8:58] the message
[9:00] uh if the ministers can't live it how
[9:02] could I live it this was a devil's
[9:04] thought that came in my mind you know uh
[9:07] and and I walked away six years I was
[9:09] out there but God in his grace got a
[9:13] hold of me amen he got a hold of me and
[9:16] he brought me back and He restored me
[9:17] and one of the first things I did is I
[9:19] just start reading the Bible I just
[9:20] stayed with the Bible I still believe
[9:22] that God was God all these six years and
[9:24] I still believe that brother Brandon was
[9:26] a true prophet of God never doubted that
[9:28] I just felt like this message is is
[9:31] something that is very difficult for
[9:33] anybody to live
[9:35] it um and that was my struggle and I
[9:37] went through a quest in the world and a
[9:39] lot of other craziness but it was just
[9:41] what it was but uh as I was reading the
[9:44] Bible over a period of time God began to
[9:46] say listen to my message listen to the
[9:48] message and I began to listen to tapes
[9:51] and read my Bible together and connect
[9:54] those two and I got to 40 messages I
[9:57] finished 40 messages
[10:00] uh and it just struck me everything that
[10:05] this man is saying is right in the Bible
[10:09] everything everything I find it right in
[10:12] the word of God I searched it and uh
[10:16] that was it for me and I'm full fully
[10:18] full-fledged believer 100% and it was
[10:20] just a little bit after that that I was
[10:24] before God praying and seeking his
[10:26] presence and and um
[10:29] I want to tell you about the power of
[10:31] your pastor here and understand when I
[10:33] say that I'm not speaking about him but
[10:35] Christ that's in him and the gift that's
[10:37] in him but I was listening to a tape of
[10:40] another
[10:41] Minister uh who was preaching and
[10:43] quoting from the message and he was
[10:47] started to get into near the end of
[10:48] brother R's Ministry he started talking
[10:50] about something new in the science
[10:52] community in the bioscience Community
[10:54] called C called genetics and genetic
[10:57] code and genetic research and started
[10:58] saying that how brother bandam was like
[11:00] the scientist in a way and started
[11:01] digging into deeper things as as one
[11:03] Revelation open opens up the door to a
[11:05] lot of other Revelations these these
[11:07] doors are blocked by religious people
[11:09] but through a prophet we've had doors
[11:11] opening to us if one door opens it opens
[11:13] up other thing and it corrects all the
[11:15] errors it's amazing it's automatic it
[11:17] has to happen that way so he starts
[11:19] brother he starts talking about how he
[11:21] the prophet begins all in' 65 or so
[11:23] talking on a theme of C Gene you're a c
[11:26] Gene of God you know you're not just a
[11:28] thought of God you're actually part of
[11:29] God's genetic code amen hallelujah
[11:32] you're a part of God everybody
[11:34] understand that Hall that's that's why
[11:36] David said Lord restore unto me the joy
[11:38] of thy salvation you know people don't
[11:40] understand it exactly but in a way when
[11:43] when Adam when Adam gave up his life to
[11:45] save his wife Eve how many understands
[11:47] that's what happened he was not just
[11:48] saving Eve he was saving
[11:50] himself when Jesus was on the cross
[11:52] dying he wasn't just saving you he was
[11:54] saving himself right because he was
[11:56] redeeming his purpose he has a purpose
[11:59] going to happen he's a redeemer amen
[12:01] amen and so and so in that sense
[12:04] understand this that God's whole story
[12:05] the whole Plan of Salvation everything
[12:06] is Gods it belongs to him you just you
[12:09] and I are blessed part of it but there's
[12:11] something in you that's a part of him
[12:12] and that that Revelation started to
[12:14] strike me as I laid on my bed and and
[12:17] and all of a sudden the whole room began
[12:20] to become white it it it was lit up it
[12:23] was like a cloud had come into the room
[12:26] I became Frozen to my bed I couldn't
[12:29] move I couldn't
[12:31] speak God's presence was there and I
[12:35] could hear the preacher's voice and I
[12:38] could hear the prophet's voice and I
[12:41] could hear the voice of God you are my
[12:44] seed Jean you're my son you're my
[12:48] Offspring you're part of my it changed

[13:04] national identity
[13:06] crisis we have craziness going on and we
[13:08] have this it's true and in the message
[13:09] we have identitive crisis still but it
[13:12] has to come to this place and I hope
[13:14] right here maybe this morning someone
[13:16] right here is is really starting to
[13:17] impact your
[13:18] heart he's saying to me I'm his child

[13:27] me he can't let me be l lost the devil's
[13:30] been lying to me I can't be lost I'm

[13:41] impossible have a hope within the veil
[13:43] an anchor amen am that that we are in
[13:47] him and we're in Christ and we're part
[13:48] of him so that really changed my life at
[13:50] at 24 years of age it's Indescribable
[13:53] I'm doing my best to share with you um
[13:56] from the time I was 19 to 25 I had a
[13:57] foot ailment I don't know even
[13:59] understand what it was but my uh the
[14:00] pediatrist that I was visiting um sent
[14:03] me the sports medicine and they said
[14:05] they were going to take a knife you know
[14:07] put me under the cut my cut my heels and
[14:10] shave and cut and I walked away I
[14:12] nobody's cutting me you're not cutting
[14:13] me leave leave me alone put your knife
[14:16] away
[14:17] buddy that's not going to
[14:19] happen but for for those years you know
[14:22] from 19 to 25 six years I I suffered
[14:25] with this foot illness it's a carryover
[14:27] you know when you go live out in the
[14:28] world you're going to you're going to
[14:29] pay for some things right and some
[14:31] things God's going to remove from you so
[14:33] by his grace um I was about 25 years old
[14:38] and I was listening to a message called
[14:41] the queen of the South I think it was 19
[14:43] 59
[14:44] and I got to the healing line part of it
[14:47] was which is always the frosting on the
[14:48] cake for me I love that part don't you
[14:50] healing line amazing and I was just
[14:53] sitting there and I was and brother was
[14:55] going through the line and going through
[14:56] the line
[14:59] uh and I and I and I and the person he
[15:01] talked to and I didn't know this until
[15:03] till last year but the person he talked
[15:05] to just before this event that happenss
[15:07] with the tape was actually Katherine
[15:09] hickey anybody who know who Katherine
[15:10] hickey is she's a well-known Pentecostal
[15:12] charismatic t angelist look her up on
[15:15] YouTube but anyway she was she was
[15:17] actually the woman that was Barren that
[15:19] he prophesied she would have a baby so
[15:20] it's pretty cool pretty cool that I
[15:22] found that out later but here it
[15:24] was uh quite a few years ago when I was
[15:27] 25 I'm sitting there and he's he moves
[15:29] from
[15:30] the from the the heal the healing line
[15:33] he goes to the audience as he often did
[15:35] it says there's such a faith out there
[15:36] he says he says you over there he starts
[15:38] calling people and I just in my heart I
[15:41] just said Lord if I could have been
[15:44] there oh what an amazing thing I would
[15:46] have loved to even have been in the
[15:49] audience CU I'm just in so much
[15:52] pain takes me half hour I get the
[15:54] morning just to get my shoes on my
[15:56] ankles were swollen double triple size
[16:00] it's weird disease have when you're
[16:02] young you didn't even know what it was
[16:05] and I'm sitting there thinking this and
[16:06] all of a sudden he says young man
[16:08] sitting
[16:09] there you believe on the Lord Jesus
[16:11] Christ you have a foot
[16:14] trouble you're going to be
[16:16] healed believe the Lord Jesus
[16:20] [Applause]
[16:27] Christ God knock off the off onto the
[16:30] floor and I spent oh my and God healed
[16:33] me completely delivered me from this
[16:36] foot thing I couldn't run I couldn't
[16:38] barely walk in fact I worked for a shoe
[16:40] store for a while and the owner finally
[16:42] says why don't you go get another job I
[16:44] mean he says it's not because you're not
[16:45] good you're good but I hate to see you
[16:48] suffer I think a bad advertisement for
[16:50] you the shoes look at how
[16:53] they my brother-in-law called me
[16:57] Olympus he's a good
[17:02] but when God was ready and it was in his
[17:04] time he did something Indescribable he
[17:06] did something that you can't even put
[17:08] together in your own
[17:11] head you know there was a time when I
[17:12] was going to preach uh up in Canada over
[17:15] in Montreal and um I had a message in
[17:18] mind to preach called show me your face
[17:21] you know how Moses said Show Me Your
[17:23] Glory and God say you see my Lord you
[17:24] can't see my face so there's a song
[17:26] written by Paul Wilbur Who is uh part of
[17:28] Israel's hope a singing group Messianic
[17:31] Jewish singers which is they believe in
[17:33] Christ and Jesus is Christ and at any
[17:35] rate I I love that song and I think it
[17:37] ties in well have you ever heard that
[17:38] song brother Simon show me your face
[17:41] beautiful beautiful song you you've got
[17:42] to listen to it talks about moving past
[17:45] veils and going into the holy of holies
[17:47] to see God's face and I was going to I
[17:49] had this whole message based on that
[17:50] idea show me your face and um I thought
[17:53] you know I'm going to bring this song
[17:54] with me u i I copied it carefully on CD
[17:58] I stashed it away so that when I made my
[18:00] trip i' bring it with me and I thought
[18:02] I'll have the young people learn it so
[18:04] they can sing it in French because in
[18:07] montal you speak French so I had this
[18:08] great plan in my head and so the day
[18:11] came and I'm on my way and I'm driving
[18:12] up to Canada um halfway through Vermont
[18:15] and um I start thinking about this
[18:20] song and I say I started to down on me I
[18:24] left the CD
[18:26] home totally I oh it would have been so
[18:29] nice so I just let it
[18:32] go and I'm sitting in the office and I'm
[18:35] praying about the two messages I'm going
[18:37] to preach and which one I'm going to
[18:38] preach and I had two on mine I show me
[18:41] your face and another one called
[18:43] restoring the altar rehealing the altar
[18:45] as as you know Elijah did and I'm
[18:47] sitting there and all of a sudden I'm
[18:49] hearing this music in
[18:51] French young people young youth chir s
[18:55] show me your face
[18:59] how do you do that how do you even plan
[19:02] that stuff can't plan it come on God

[19:08] out you can't change your destiny and

[19:29] down to Tennessee because uh she was
[19:31] from Tennessee and brother Donnie
[19:32] Reagan's church and he married us and
[19:36] dedicated our kids and all that stuff
[19:37] but anyway we were going to go down
[19:39] there so I had a preacher for her for
[19:40] the weekend and we were just going down
[19:41] there to visit family and I was having
[19:43] that weekend off I wasn't going to be
[19:44] preaching at all so Friday evening I'm
[19:47] in the word I'm in the word the Lord has
[19:49] anointed me I'm I'm preparing I'm
[19:51] preparing I think brother Chris forong
[19:54] knows and experienced something similar
[19:55] to this but I Was preparing and my wife
[19:57] comes she goes we gotta leave in the
[19:59] morning and you're in here studying why
[20:02] are you studying you're not preaching
[20:03] this
[20:04] weekend I said I don't know why but I
[20:07] feel like I just need to do this she
[20:09] said okay so I prepared and we went down
[20:13] and as soon as we got
[20:15] there uh on Saturday uh I believe it was
[20:18] brother Donnie Reagan saw me driving in
[20:20] and he runs over he says he says brother
[20:22] elah there's been a bad accident's
[20:24] family has been uh in a terrible train
[20:27] accident did you take
[20:29] service I said sure I'm
[20:32] ready I was ready but I really didn't
[20:35] know how that was going to happen but
[20:37] God already
[20:39] knew so we just have to be very good and
[20:43] very good stewards that when God's
[20:45] leading to do something get ready to do
[20:47] it doesn't mean you can describe it it
[20:48] doesn't mean you know how to put it
[20:50] together in words but just get out there
[20:52] and do the best that you can do so I'm
[20:54] going to close with that um how many
[20:56] loves him with all your heart amen
[20:59] [Applause]
[21:06] he's got all in control he's got all in
[21:08] control he's got everything mapped out
[21:10] perfectly perfectly you won't miss so
[21:13] all our worry and all our stress is
[21:15] nothing uh and don't even think don't
[21:17] even let it come into your mind about
[21:19] you know oh man these people they're
[21:21] saying that the cloud was from a from a
[21:23] Thor rocket and and all this stuff and
[21:26] uh you know all this stuff and you know
[21:28] these things
[21:28] [Music]
[21:31] saints come on let's be honest and by
[21:34] the way just so you know I did the
[21:36] research I spent hundreds of hours
[21:38] looking at all the scientific
[21:40] explanations
[21:41] including uh Mr McDonald who they say
[21:45] didn't write a final report but I found
[21:46] his final report I've read it I've made
[21:48] a chart that shows that all the rocket
[21:51] fuels that were in that particular
[21:52] rocket could not have survived amen
[21:56] without dissipating immediately as a
[21:58] cloud at that
[22:01] height so unless they know they exist
[22:04] and don't want to talk about it or
[22:05] unless they just been dig even up find
[22:06] the information either way they're
[22:08] irresponsible and I'm not against people
[22:10] I'm just against the spirit that would
[22:11] try to come against us but don't let it
[22:13] f you don't let it body like some
[22:15] sometimes you say I don't really care if
[22:16] it was a cloud of a rocket or was a
[22:19] supernatural or either way I still
[22:21] believe God it was God you mean yeah
[22:23] that's okay you know that's like saying
[22:26] the light that led the wise man was
[22:27] probably planet know yeah that's what
[22:29] they say but I believe it was a
[22:30] supernatural
[22:33] light
[22:34] so I have the evidence the proof is I I
[22:37] went ahead and went at it as devil
[22:39] Devil's ad Advocate to try and prove
[22:42] that the cloud was made from a rocket
[22:45] and I spoke to uh different professors
[22:48] and directors of meteorology and
[22:51] universities and other men who are in
[22:53] physics and the a Astro Aerospace type
[22:57] of technology in areas like that I spoke
[22:59] to these gentlemen and it all comes down
[23:00] to the same thing they all said told me
[23:02] the very same thing this is a phenomenon
[23:05] it shouldn't be
[23:07] there amen
[23:09] hallelujah hallelujah but I'm excited
[23:12] you can't describe it's hard to
[23:13] understand it but God knows what he's
[23:18] doing Arizona was the one state out of
[23:21] any other state in one country out of
[23:23] any other country that God said to our
[23:27] to brother Adam go there
[23:29] and then this Cloud shows up in the same
[23:31] area what are the odds lots of odds
[23:34] against it why Arizona by the way
[23:35] anybody know why Arizona because it's
[23:37] the backside America is the back side of
[23:39] the
[23:40] world Arizona is the backside of America
[23:43] and it was on the back side of desert
[23:46] amen Arizona was the last state added to
[23:49] the continent of the United
[23:50] [Music]
[23:51] States last age last
[23:55] state praise the Lord amen amen why did
[23:58] the cloud show up this day and then 7
[24:00] Days Later he's over here and well then
[24:03] why did Angels show up around Persia
[24:07] Babylon fighting a spiritual war when
[24:10] Daniel was way over here in another
[24:12] place and it was 21 days later because
[24:15] angels have to get access first and they
[24:17] can't do it without getting
[24:19] jurisdiction I don't know if you guys
[24:21] understand what the war is with the
[24:22] angels there's a war with angels and
[24:25] God's angels woring against Satan his
[24:27] angels and it's a jurisic war and it can
[24:29] only be overcome by the word of
[24:31] God it's a it's bid
[24:34] words Satan was fighting over the body
[24:37] of Moses why because it's jurisdiction
[24:39] he has the right to take them decompose
[24:40] them and kill him he can't let he
[24:41] doesn't want him raising again that
[24:42] would be terrible but we know Moses
[24:45] probably did because that's what the
[24:46] argument was about it took Michael to
[24:48] come on the scene to finish that battle
[24:49] off
[24:50] amen so it's about of warfare and you
[24:53] say why why why in the north Why didn't
[24:55] it come over this other area because
[24:57] because God is a god of mountains God
[25:00] chooses Mount Zion he chooses Mount
[25:02] Mariah he chooses mountains all the time
[25:04] and Satan always wants to do what God
[25:05] does so he chooses mountains you know
[25:07] the King on the
[25:09] mountain and so mountains High the
[25:12] highest mountains in any area is the
[25:14] jurisdiction demons live on mountains
[25:16] the Hy Indians the the nav Indians were
[25:19] all worshiping at a certain Mountain the
[25:21] highest mountain in Arizona is Mount
[25:23] Humphrey and that's where the cloud
[25:25] hovered over amen why there cuz seven
[25:28] angels need to beat up the angels that
[25:30] are standing around
[25:31] there by the way the H Indians and the
[25:33] Navajo Indians and the the other Indians
[25:35] there are all worship that God called
[25:37] the God of
[25:38] Thunder yeah the God of Thunder anyone
[25:40] know who the God of Thunder is right
[25:42] he's Thor from Europe and they just
[25:44] stole that from the Greeks who got it
[25:46] from the Jews not the Jews but from the
[25:49] worshippers of Baal Baal is a god of
[25:52] thunder go study it Bale is the God of
[25:54] Thunder Thor is a god of thunder right
[25:58] that's why I had to be a Thor
[26:01] rocket which God will you
[26:04] serve it's up to you either that's
[26:06] Jehovah God or that's Thor it's up to
[26:10] you I know who it was it's time to chop
[26:14] off some heads at the
[26:16] [Music]
[26:19] river CH off that mentality I think it
[26:22] might have been a rocket but I'm still a
[26:23] message believer okay fine maybe when
[26:26] you go on a Rapture it'll be a rocket
[26:27] too
[26:29] better go to Nassau right now
[26:34] St as for me in my house I'm going to
[26:37] serve the
[26:40] [Applause]
[26:45] Lord this happened in 1963 100 years
[26:49] earlier Arizona became a territory of
[26:51] the United
[26:52] States by Abraham Lincoln Abraham
[26:56] Lincoln made Arizona a territory in the
[26:59] United States and 100 years later a
[27:01] cloud shows up Abraham in the
[27:03] Bible 100 years later the Lord shows
[27:07] up when he's 100 right 9900 so the Lord
[27:12] shows
[27:14] up and and where's Abraham and why does
[27:16] the bible tell us this I don't know it
[27:17] seems weird it doesn't even make any
[27:18] sense he's sitting under the oak trees
[27:21] it says Plains of M but look it up
[27:23] brother talks about it he was sitting
[27:24] under the oak trees the oak trees M he
[27:27] just sitting under oak trees
[27:29] who cares do I care do you care who
[27:31] cares he's sitting under oak tree so
[27:34] what it's important it's in the Bible
[27:38] guess what Arizona means in the vast
[27:41] language is ancient root language of of
[27:44] Spanish The Basque language ER on
[27:49] means Hallelujah the place of the
[27:52] good amen
[27:55] hallelujah isn't that exciting amen
[27:58] yeah God has such a sense of humor and
[28:01] it's so amazing how he plans this stuff
[28:03] out am so perfect amen there's Abraham
[28:06] years later there it is and everything
[28:08] is happening perfectly and I want you to
[28:09] understand that when God was done
[28:11] deserting Sarah's laughing in her heart
[28:13] that he was deserting the hearts the end
[28:14] of the second pole was happening right
[28:16] then really was identified but it was
[28:18] happening but it was also moving into a
[28:20] third pole at that moment I'm going to
[28:21] visit you in the time of life the son is
[28:23] coming Hallelujah you understand that so
[28:25] he says this third poll what is it how
[28:27] did God identif that because God said
[28:29] shall I continue to keep secret the
[28:32] thing that I shall do God had a secret
[28:35] it was a mystery and it was time for the
[28:37] mystery to start opening up and as it
[28:40] began to open up make that known to
[28:42] Abraham because he says Abraham will be
[28:44] faithful to what I teach him and he'll
[28:45] teach his children Hallelujah and that
[28:47] mystery that was revealed to Abraham has
[28:49] impacted him so much that he ended up
[28:53] standing in the gap for Sodom yes didn't
[28:57] he yes he moved into he moved into a
[29:00] mediator
[29:01] Ministry third poll is a Ministry of
[29:06] mediatorship for God's people for the
[29:09] Abraham group amen it's moving into the
[29:12] little prayer
[29:14] closet GL praise God Satan hates you to
[29:18] read your Bible he hates you to go to
[29:19] church but he really hates it if you
[29:20] pray don't PR oh yeah Satan can take
[29:24] away your church he can take away your
[29:25] worship system he can take away your
[29:27] Bible he can take away all your message
[29:28] books and tapes and put you in jail and
[29:31] you have nothing you'll be next to Paul
[29:33] and
[29:35] Silas
[29:38] Hallelujah PA and silus could worship
[29:40] but what if you put duct tape or
[29:41] something B now you can't even speak but
[29:45] he cannot remove from you
[29:50] pray Hall ultimately here's your little
[29:55] room Hallelujah
[29:58] brother R was seeing in his vision the
[30:00] third po the big Tabernacle we know all
[30:01] that whole story the people coming up
[30:03] and then there's this platform not the
[30:05] platforms not done now the second Po's
[30:07] over the little tiny room off to the
[30:09] corner and everybody ask what about
[30:10] little room little room little room well
[30:11] he asked the question did anybody know
[30:13] that he asked the question why the
[30:14] little
[30:15] room anybody remember what was what he
[30:17] was
[30:19] told don't you love every time he ask a
[30:22] question the angel or whoever it was
[30:23] speaking to him always pointed back to
[30:24] the word of God it's
[30:26] great he said why the little room and
[30:29] this voice said did not our Lord say
[30:32] when you pray go into your
[30:35] closet in secret and God who sees in
[30:39] secret will reward
[30:42] you we hav't close to the third pole
[30:45] like we ought to but the third poll
[30:47] works like this while his wife was in
[30:49] the room to be opera on for cancer
[30:51] brother R was in a different state was
[30:53] all the way across the country and he
[30:55] was told to stand to his feet and to
[30:57] speak in prayer and he spoke and he said
[30:59] let the cancer the size of the Grave
[31:01] fruit disappear before the doctor even
[31:02] comes back to touch it and it happened
[31:05] just like that Saints I don't know about
[31:07] you but it could be loved ones it could
[31:09] be people who are believers around the
[31:11] world you don't even know who they
[31:13] are that God's going to bring in front
[31:15] of you amen and you're going to pray for
[31:17] them and they're going to be delivered
[31:19] amen and they're not even going to know
[31:20] how it
[31:22] happen you're not going to
[31:24] tell cuz the third poll is not is
[31:29] it's no longer a man show flesh is being
[31:31] taken out of the picture human efforts
[31:34] are taken out of the picture the days of
[31:37] of that is ending can you say
[31:40] that Sodom and gomorra lot didn't even
[31:42] have a clue that there was a man on the
[31:43] hill standing between God the judge of
[31:45] the quick and the dead and themselves
[31:47] called Abraham who was standing with one
[31:49] hand this way one that way standing
[31:51] there in the Gap praying in the third
[31:53] pole Ministry he got it he understood it
[31:55] what was it it was the spirit of Christ
[31:58] rose up
[31:59] in before God that's what you're
[32:02] supposed to do and I'm supposed to do
[32:04] we're supposed to rise up to the
[32:06] occasion because otherwise the mighty
[32:09] Angel has no other way to manifest
[32:10] himself except through the people of God
[32:13] Hallelujah Jesus Christ put on the land
[32:16] on the sea and he can only do it through
[32:18] are people who are dedicated to what
[32:21] this is and it's called very simply
[32:23] nothing that you get credit for you say
[32:26] oh I heard somebody got healed I saw a
[32:28] newspaper I was the one who pray for
[32:30] them it was you're not going to do that
[32:31] because true mature character in a
[32:34] person is what gives you the right and
[32:36] makes you fit to rule and reign with
[32:39] Jesus Christ or you're only going to
[32:41] give the glory to the Lord
[32:46] Jesus this isn't for you and it's not
[32:48] for me and it's not for brother Simon
[32:50] this is for Jesus
[32:52] Christ
[32:54] Hallelujah don't follow a man we follow
[32:56] the lord Jesus
[33:00] hallah brother please come I
[33:03] [Applause]
[33:16] appreciate God me to rescue him from the
[33:20] anointing that just make him continue
[33:23] swimming moving in the spirit of God
[33:26] hallelujah that's wonderful to see the
[33:29] hand of God upon our brother and a
[33:31] unique Indescribable Ministry amen uh
[33:35] the way the Lord uses him it's
[33:37] absolutely unique and Indescribable and
[33:40] we want to thank the Lord for that let's
[33:42] give God
[33:45] [Applause]
[33:53] praise our our brother was speaking I I
[33:57] just
[33:58] thought of this uh scripture which I'd
[34:01] like to read and I believe that this is
[34:05] Indescribable listen he says here and I
[34:10] saw in the right hand of him that sat on
[34:13] the throne a book written within and the
[34:16] backside sealed with Seven Seals and I
[34:19] saw a strong angel proclaiming with a
[34:22] loud voice who is worthy to open the
[34:25] book and loose the seals thereof
[34:28] and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth
[34:30] neither under the Earth was able to open
[34:33] the book neither to look there on and I
[34:36] wept much because no man was found
[34:38] worthy to open and read the book neither
[34:40] to look there on and one of the elders
[34:43] said unto me we not Behold The Lion of
[34:47] the tribe of Judah the root of David has
[34:51] prevailed to open the book and loose the
[34:53] Seven Seals thereof praise the Lord I
[34:57] believe this is Indescribable amen and I
[35:02] beheld and lo in the midst of the throne
[35:06] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[35:08] of the elders stood a lamb
[35:12] Indescribable as it had been slain
[35:14] having seven horns seven eyes which are
[35:17] the seven spirit of God sent forth unto
[35:21] all the Earth
[35:23] Indescribable and he came and took the
[35:26] book out of the right hand of him that
[35:28] sat upon the throne and when he had
[35:30] taken the book with four beasts and four
[35:32] and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb
[35:35] having every one of them Harps and
[35:37] golden vials full of odors which are the
[35:40] prayers of the Saints in this cable and
[35:45] they sng a new
[35:47] song worthy Thou Art Worthy to take the
[35:50] book and to open the the seals thereof
[35:53] for thou H was slain and has redeemed us
[35:56] to God by thy blood blood out of every
[35:59] Kindred and town and people and nation
[36:02] and has made us unto our God Kings and
[36:04] Priests and he shall reain on the earth
[36:07] hall
[36:09] hallelujah Indescribable this this
[36:11] Vision to think about it and I beheld
[36:15] and I heard a voice of many angels round
[36:19] about the throne and the beasts and the
[36:22] elders and the number of them was 10,000
[36:26] time 10,000 thousand and thousands of
[36:29] thousands in other words
[36:32] Indescribable saying with a loud voice
[36:35] wordy is the Lamb that was SL to receive
[36:39] th riches wisdom and strength and honor
[36:44] and glory and blessing and every
[36:47] creature which is in heaven and on the
[36:49] earth and under the Earth and such as
