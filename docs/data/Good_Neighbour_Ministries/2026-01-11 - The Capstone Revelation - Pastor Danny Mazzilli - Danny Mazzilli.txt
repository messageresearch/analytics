[music] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank God that he has given another [music] day to be in his house. We're going to read out our scripture this morning. Psalm 91. He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortress. My God, in him will I [music] trust. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the flower, and from the noiseome [music] pestilence. He shall cover thee with his fies, and under his wing shall thou trust. His truth shall [music] be thy shield and barkling. Thou shall not be [music] afraid for the Torah by night, nor for the arrow that Friday by day. That means you [music] are protected all the time. Thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night, [music] nor the arrow flight by day, nor the pestilence [music] that walketh in darkness. Hallelujah. nor for the destruction that waitth [music] at new day. My God, thank you. The thousand a thousand shall fall at thy [music] side and 10,000 at thy right hand, but it shall not come near thee. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Only with thy eye shall see. Be thou behold. Oh, sorry. Only with thy eye shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou had made the Lord which is my refuge, even the Most High thy habitation. Hallelujah. There shall no evil before thee, neither [music] shall any blood come near thy dwelling. My [music] God. Thank you, Lord. We are the special people. Hallelujah. Aren't you happy this morning? Oh my, I feel like jumping when I read the word of God. For he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways. [music] They shall bear thee up in their hand, lest thou dash thy foot against the stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and other the young lion and the dragon shall thou trample under the feet because [music] he has set his love upon me. Therefore will [singing] I deliver him. I [music] will set him on high because he had known my name. Do you know the name of the Lord? Yes. He [music] shall call upon me and I will answer him. I will be with him in trouble. I will deliver him and honor [music] him. With long life would I certify him and show him my [music] salvation. Hallelujah. Let's give the Lord a hand. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; sing [music] [music] to Heat. Heat. Heat. [music] From [music] the waters he lifted me [music] for you. Oh love lied me.

Amen. &gt;&gt; So, um let's go to the word of God this morning. Um and then uh we'll uh see what the Lord has for us. Amen. Praise God. Our scripture is from Jude 1:es 14 to 15. And it says, "And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, behold, the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his saints." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us pray. Father, we certainly appreciate, Lord, that your presence is in our midst this morning and that you are mindful of our needs. And that, Lord, as we assemble around your word this morning, Lord, uh it's it's it's vital to us, Father. It's our strength, Lord. It's our our food. Uh Lord, it's spiritual food in due season for the sons and daughters of God. Lord, we we assemble because we know that we uh are in your presence. You're going to speak to our needs. You're going to discern hearts and lives and situations, oh God. And Lord, we'll be able to leave here and say it was good to be in the presence of the Lord in the house of God to hear your voice and to allow your your uh healing go uh Lord come through the word of God and heal and deliver and set free the captives in the midst. Lord, may you take control, Father. Use this vessel. Anoint us for your service. Oh God, we submit and humble ourselves before you in the name of Jesus Christ and for your glory. Amen and amen. God bless you. May be seated. Glory to God. Are we ever in the capstone age? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we want to talk about today. Amen. We love the Lord and uh appreciate the time that we're living in. Amen. The scripture said that um he cometh, behold, the Lord cometh with 10 thousands of his saints and they they have a prophecy within them. &gt;&gt; They have a revelation that burns within their hearts that they need to bring forth in this last day, in this age that we're living in. Amen. And you know when you look at the word cometh it it talks about um you know when you look at the definition in the Hebrew and the Strong's concordance it says to go to to to to bring out in a great variety of applications literally and figuratively direct and and proximate. In other words, the Lord has something uh deliberate. Amen. To go out, to come out, to exit, to go forth. Amen. And what's coming? 10 thousands of his saints. Who are his saints? The sons and daughters of God that are that are manifesting in this day and in this hour that have a revelation of what God is doing in this day and in this hour. Amen. And so, you know, we've been looking at the uh world events and we see what's going on. Um, we see how, you know, uh, we want to certainly keep Venezuela in our prayers, um, because we know that, uh, there's much change and, um, things that are happening there. But, you know, we can't help but um, notice the types, you know, and what is actually going on. Last week, we spoke about, you know, the the 10 virgins and the the wise and the foolish virgin and and how, you know, the the wise had the oil, but the foolish, they had no oil. So the foolish virgin, they're going after the oil, right? And here we can look at naturally and we can look into what's going on, you know, um, in the world and we can see that, you know, they're here here the US militarily going in and and taking control of Venezuela. And there's motives there. They don't realize it there. They think there's power in the oil. We know there's power in the oil, but it's the oil of the Holy Ghost. But they they they've got a they they've got a re it's all natural. They're all after the natural wealth and the natural power and missing where the real power is. Amen. Which is in the oil of the Holy Ghost. So the you know the wise virgin they have a revelation. They can see through all of this you know but Satan has his interpretation of the Holy Ghost right and you know and his his interpretation is that you know he wants to pervert God's interpretation. He wants to uh impersonate God's interpretation. He wants to have control over the oil thinking that he can have control over God, have you know have control over the word, control it and organize it through mystery Babylon and and and so forth. Amen. But the you know um we can see very clearly here what's actually going on. These world powers think that they can have control if they control the oil. They'll also come to realize that they are not in control because the word of God has made it clear. Amen. World powers are after the oil and they're doing it. And look at the way that it's being done. And you know, it's interesting because I was having some, you know, fellowship there with my partner Frank Balisimo and we were talking about, you know, how these world events and, you know, how they're after the oil and, you know, he brought up a thought. He says, "Yeah, but you know, um, you know, Brother Brandham mentioned it, you know, one time in the scripture or or when he was preaching about how he said that, um, the nation, you know, that they would take control through military dictatorship." And you know, and I found the quote, and the quote goes back in, you know, from 1963, uh, the third exodus. Uh, Brother Bran was speaking about, um, you know, President Kennedy at the time and talking about how he had nationalized the guard, you know, because of the, um, desegregating, you know, of the blacks and, you know, to to kind of stop what like was what was going on. and and you know he had used the the National Guard to you know sort of protect the black people you know but really the motive was to gain their their votes and to gain their you know their their confidence and so forth. But what was interesting was that you know he he says here he says that um and Mr. Kennedy nationalized the guard and send those men right back into the face of their own father standing there under the constitution that broke the constitution again said we'll not fight no sir and said I hope the nation can find out that we're not living anymore under democracy but under military dictatorship and this is now what we're actually witnessing in the world in how that you know these global powers and clearly here even President Trump you know using his uh global um you know influence and his power militarily to you know to take control. Amen. So it's interesting times saints and of course we know that you know that it's all under levels of deception many forms of deception when it comes to the foolish and the wise virgins uh many different compound meanings uh you know right from the you know the regular Christian churches out there they all think that they have a revelation of Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus who is the word right they they they they don't realize you that the oil uh that's you know that's um that that is the Holy Ghost they they don't realize they don't have any revelation of the oil. You know the majority of of the the churches out there the you know denominational churches they have no revelation on what the oil really truly represents which is the Holy Ghost the purpose of God to come and possess his sons and his daughters. Amen. Praise God through the message of the hour. And so, go to the next slide. Um, you know, on uh New Year's Eve, we brought this inspiration on Give Me My Mountain, and it kind of inspired me to go a little deeper into the capstone and to look into it. And this is why, you know, um, you know, we're going to look at this. I don't know how long this series will go. Could be a few services. Let's just see what the Lord's going to do. Amen. But um you know it's uh you know we've heard that we're under the capstone ministry. We just sang it, right? We just sang it that this is the this is the capstone age. It's the age where the mighty angel himself which is the capstone comes down to meet with the body. Amen. To produce the actual capping of the pyramid. Amen. And you know so we've heard it said it's the capstone age. then there has to be a capstone revelation. Amen. And that's what we want to look at today. Let's uh let's read our scripture. Um we're going to look at Enoch in uh Genesis 5:21 to 24. It says, "And Enoch lived 60 and5 years and begat Methuselah. And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were 365 years. And Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, when I read scripture and and I know that, you know, when you read scripture because the Holy Ghost in us gives us the ability to uh to to see and and see the the the life that's behind the scripture. It it just you can't help but see certain things, you know. And as I'm reading this, I'm saying, "And Enoch lived 60 and five years and begat Methuselah, right?" And I thought, oh, 65 years. And I thought, well, 1963, you know, if you add 65 years to that, it brings us into 2028, right? And begott Methuselah. And we know that Methuselah is a type of the millennium because he lived, he was the long, I believe he was the longest, you know, uh, uh, one after Adam lived like 969 years, almost 1,000 years. And so, now I'm not putting anything on that. I'm not saying, "Oh, 2028, we're out of here." No, we could be out of here today. &gt;&gt; We could be out tomorrow. We could be out 50 years from now. Nobody is going to put anything on it. But I can tell you, it's close. &gt;&gt; Because how do we know it's close? Because the revelation burns within our hearts. &gt;&gt; There's a there's a there's a revelation. See, Enoch had a revelation that was burning within him. He had the revelation of the mystery of God in him to the point where he actually built the pyramids and he built the great pyramid. Amen. And how do we know that? Because God sent us a prophet that was able to go into the mind of God. Science and people out there and you know there's speculation on how those pyramids were made. But we know that it was Enoch that built that pyramid. And so let's read our uh quote here. Brother Bram speaking here. He says in um the infallibility of God's spoken word, he says, "Enoch, Enoch, before the world, the anti-delivian destruction, if he wanted to show a type, how could he do it if he didn't want Enoch to die? He had to make a translation for him. So God just made a rapture for him. God had to do it in order to make a type out of Enoch. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, God is showing us through the scriptures that Enoch is a perfect type of what the bride of Jesus Christ is going to experience. &gt;&gt; And so that's why we want to we want to dig into Enoch's life and we want to look into, you know, his life and, you know, some of the things that that we draw out of it. Amen. And so here, you know, what what we can see here is we want to thank the Lord first of all that God sent us a prophet that was able to go into into the mind of God and allows us by the Holy Ghost to experience the same thoughts and the same revelation that he had. Amen. While he was here preaching the word of God. And that's why when we when we read the quotes of the prophet and and and uh uh the inspiration that was on him comes on you then you know that it's the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same revelation. It's it's God in in in progression of what he's doing now so that we can apply this revelation of this type of you know these quotes to our day and see ourselves and how we fit into those types. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we want to see how it's going to produce in our day. Glory to God. Brother Brandon brought these quotes back in 1963 and you know and and and so forth. But how does it apply to us today? How's that revelation living out of us today? Because listen, in Enoch, there was a lot of mystery. There was a lot of silence. There's not a lot said about Enoch's life. &gt;&gt; But yet, he had the complete revelation in him. &gt;&gt; How do you know he had it? Because he walked with God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. And God revealed exactly what was in his mind to Enoch. And Enoch was able to express it so that we could see the types. So, you know, there's a mystery in the way that God reveals his word. And there's a silence in the mystery, but yet within that silence, there's there's individuals that are still manifesting the interpretation of that silence. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And this is the element, you know, that that that we're breaking into as the bride of Christ. We are the ones that are that are in the midst of this mystery. We're we're in this world. People look at us, they wonder, "Boy, you you're you're strange. You're peculiar." Yeah. Well, you know, this revelation that's on us makes us peculiar. I can imagine Enoch was very peculiar in his day. &gt;&gt; When the people would see him, what are you doing, Enoch? I'm building the altar of the Lord. So we want we want to see and understand as we look at this life how it pertains to us and you know how we can kind of you know see where the Lord wants to place us in the whole thing because you know we we we talked about give me my mountain. Well there's a portion of the word that's yours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you need to you need to get a hold of it. It's a revelation of you, your part, who you are, the part that you're to fulfill here within this local ministry. Everything. Listen, we we want to bring this home. We want You want to know why you're a part of this ministry? You don't want to be just a churchgoer. Is that Is that what you want? You want to be a church member? Oh, I go to church. There's a lot of There's thousands of people going to church. But there's got to be a revelation of why you are a part of the church and the body of Jesus Christ in this day and in this hour. &gt;&gt; That's what we're interested in. Amen. So, we come to realize that um you know, you know, we've been ministering on this whole series of the purpose of God and this is really like an offshoot, but yet it's a part of it because this is all part of the purpose of God. And what are we coming to realize? that we have a part that we have a part in the great mystery of Christ being revealed in these days and that you know though in 1963 the mighty angel came down and finished the mystery of God in that he he took William Branham he expressed through the life of William Branham brother Brham he expressed his uh you know how how god was was uh manifesting in human flesh He was the He was brother Brandham was the wave sheath &gt;&gt; of what we are going to manifest and and and and eventually be in in our personal walks with God. &gt;&gt; Some have already come into their manifestation. Some are slowly coming out of the amnesia still not realizing. But yet those that are recognizing have entered into that element of perfect faith &gt;&gt; to know what God is doing in this hour. Amen. And so, Brother Brandham was the first to come to that full maturity in the manifestation of of a son of man revealing the son of man and then the two uniting together where now the son of man is being uh is manifesting in bride form &gt;&gt; where Christ the capstone has come to meet with the body and unite with the body. and allow the revelation of the mystery to live through our personal lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Amen. So, the mystery of the seventh seal is all playing out. &gt;&gt; It It's still in progress. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is not finished. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brandham said. &gt;&gt; Amen. and and and we know that now. And so this the the seventh seal continues to unfold and it's unfolding in your lives. &gt;&gt; It's going to unfold into the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's going to then unfold into the millennial reign. Amen. And then it's going to unfold into the into the uh the the the future home of the bride and and the and the the the heavenly bridegroom and the and the bride. Amen. It's all manifesting. It's in progression. &gt;&gt; And and those that have recognized that that the seal is open and that it's it's they they've also recognized that they're a part of that seal. &gt;&gt; And they're in manifestation of that of that open book because they have THE OPEN BOOK. THE BIBLE has become A BRAND NEW BOOK. THAT'S why when we read these things, when we when we look at the types, when we see what the what brother Brandham said, we we can identify with it, we can see ourselves in it. &gt;&gt; We can see that we're that we're that element in in 2025 or 2026. &gt;&gt; And that there's a mountain that we are a part of. &gt;&gt; That we have to go and take a hold of. Amen. Praise God forever more. And so, you know, it was interesting as I was, you know, reading and studying all of this, you just see certain things and I and I went back and I and I looked at, you know, Enoch walked with God. I said, "Who else walked with God?" Do you know that when when you put it in the in the in the search in the Bible in the King James version, there's only two that actually walked with God. And it was Noah and Enoch. And they were around right at the same time. One's building a an altar unto the Lord. And the other one is building an ark to take them through the tribulation that's going to come upon the earth. And there we know that there's all types there. Okay? We can see how Noah could type the foolish virgin and then he could type the bride and then he could like there's so many compound revelations there. But we do know that it's interesting that the two of them were given revelation on building. They had revelation because we know that the ark also types Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And that you know once you're in Christ, God seals you &gt;&gt; until the day of your redemption. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was God that sealed the ark &gt;&gt; that nothing could come in. Nothing could touch them. They were protected. They were sealed until the day of their redemption when the waters subsided. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so, you know, we realize that Enoch typed all of this and his walk with God eventually produced his translation. because the revelation became so &gt;&gt; real. &gt;&gt; He started to he started to see that that you know that that God was actually revealing things to him that you know because in that pyramid is the entire plan of redemption &gt;&gt; all about the king and the queen. &gt;&gt; Amen. all about God wanting to dwell in humans here on earth to have a a reign with his with his uh with with his w with himself in bride form in female form. God wanted to have a family here on earth. But it was a God family. &gt;&gt; It was a God family. Amen. Glory to God. But Enoch got so caught up into the revelation that God started to realize, wait a minute here. He's at the final. He's He's He's at He's at that final point where where where he's going to put the capstone. Oh. Oh, hang on a minute here. This is, you know, I imagine you know what they must have thought when they looked at the pyramid that Enoch had built and see that there was no capstone. They're wondering where's where's the capstone? What's going on, Enoch? all of a sudden they want to go find and and and you know kind of ask Enoch themselves, but he was he was not &gt;&gt; cuz God took him. And so when we look at that, we look at that capstone and and you know that that that we see there's a mystery all around it. It looked unfinished. What happened? There was a mystery between when he got to the very top of the pyramid and then God took him. Imagine and no capstone. And there is a silence in this whole element. There's a mystery in it all. &gt;&gt; But yet, we're in the days of the where where where Revelations 10 1-7 said that in the days of the voice of the of the uh the the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God would be finished. God would be revealing &gt;&gt; what was in that element of the silence. Amen. Glory to God. Let's read our let's let's uh read a quote here from Christ is the mystery of God revealed. He says, listen, so we're looking at all the types here. We're seeing how God shows these types and what and and and and the mystery of what was all through. And he goes, God's great mystery of how it's a secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody knowed nothing about it. Even the angels didn't understand it. See, he didn't reveal it. That's the reason under our seventh mystery, when the seventh seal was open, there was silence. &gt;&gt; Jesus, when he was on the earth, they wanted to know when he would come. He said, "It's not even the son of man himself don't know when it's going to happen." See, God has this all to himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; God had an appointed time. &gt;&gt; God is not going to go ahead of himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. God has a plan. And so here, go to the next. It's a secret, he says. And that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour. And seven thunders uttered their voices. And John was even forbidden to write it. See the coming of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we know that that the opening of that seventh seal and those seven thunders &gt;&gt; uttering their voices was a revelation of the coming of the Lord. And in those seven thunders was the silence was the was the mystery was the was the revelation that WOULD THAT WOULD CAP OFF THE ENTIRE age that would bring the bride into her perfection that would lead her into a perfect revelation of her position in the word of God. &gt;&gt; But it's in silence. IT'S IN MYSTERY. BUT YET IT'S MANIFESTING. &gt;&gt; WE'RE LOOKING back and we're seeing that. Wait a minute. In the mystery and in the silence THERE'S A MANIFESTATION. &gt;&gt; BUT NOT EVERYBODY SEES IT. &gt;&gt; WHAT? WHAT? WHAT IS THAT? &gt;&gt; WHAT? Because there's that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come. It's a good thing that he doesn't know that he doesn't know. And then he goes on, he says next slide he says he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So if we want to understand our placing in the word, what it is to produce in our lives, then we need to be able to have the revelation and the Holy Ghost to be able to bring the word to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. To to to recognize the word and bring it to life. He says, "Therefore, the entire Bible is the revelation of God's mystery in Christ." H he says the entire Bible is an expression of one goal that God had one purpose that he wanted to achieve in the entire Bible. And all the acts listen and all the acts of the believers. Are you a believer this morning? &gt;&gt; Then you can be identified with this &gt;&gt; that that of the believers in the Bible has been a type and expressing what God's great goal is. And now in this last day, he has revealed it and shows it &gt;&gt; and God's help will see it right here this morning. What the Lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; SO ALL THE TYPES EVERYTHING THAT we see all that that you know that that is that that is a mystery you know people listening in maybe on this service that you know they they don't have uh you know um a lot of the the the the background and the teachings of the revelation of this message of the ministry of brother William Branham and what he what what he represented as the seventh church age messenger. There's elements in there that that lays the foundation for what it is that we are ministering on here today. And it's important to have that understanding and that background for this to to really bring you into into a perfect faith experience with the word of God so that you can see yourself in the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's it's so important to be able to recognize what Jesus is doing today. Amen. &gt;&gt; In this hour, &gt;&gt; what the word says about the church, &gt;&gt; where she fits into the whole program of God. Look at all the types throughout the Bible. The coming of the Lord has always been in secret. While it was played out, but yet today the seals have been taken off the book and the book is open, but it's not open to everybody. And this is the element that's that's, you know, oh, what do you make yourself? You make yourself something. No, we're not making ourselves anything. But I can't help seeing what I'm seeing. &gt;&gt; I can't help it that when I read the word and when I listen to the messenger and I hear God's voice speaking to me over the pulpit through the five-fold ministry, I can't help but identify myself in all these types in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You got to BE ABLE TO SEE JESUS CHRIST in every type because in the unveiling of Jesus Christ in this hour, it unveils you. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE UNVEILING THAT'S WHAT THE MIGHTY VEIL WHEN WHEN the veils rips back, it's going to see the bride of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; in in bright form, the the son of man uh revealing himself, speaking his word, the final voice to the final age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But it's a revelation personally to each attribute who is ordained to see it. When? In the end time. &gt;&gt; When was this mystery to be revealed? In the end time. &gt;&gt; What age are we in? We're in the We're in the last days. &gt;&gt; We're in the Daniel spoke about it that seal it up until the time of the end. &gt;&gt; This is that time. &gt;&gt; This is the time of the end. This is when the mystery is to be unlocked. &gt;&gt; This is when the capstone when when when when they look into that capstone, they're not going to see just white. They're going to see themselves. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They're going to see the word manifesting through their lives. Amen. Glory to God. And so, so this day under the seventh church age messenger, the seventh seal is opened. And yet there's silence. And there's still silence. People look at your life and they wonder what is it? Why are they so excited? What's going on in them? There's an Enoch revelation &gt;&gt; that's burning within their hearts to bring forth the full revelation of God &gt;&gt; in this day and in this hour. &gt;&gt; The fullness of the word has been revealed to her. and she can't help but but but but look into the scripture, identify the seven church ages, recognize the messengers to each age. See how the Holy Ghost moved into every one of those church age messengers and unveiled Christ in the midst of them. She can't help it. You've been given the Holy Ghost to recognize Jesus said, he said that I will give you the comforter which is the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and he will guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; Well, what's the truth? The word. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no higher truth. Glory to God. So, we've got all these examples, you know, and it was always in mystery. Just look back at, you know, go back and take Ruth for example in the book of Ruth and you know how Boaz you know Boaz gives Ruth six measures of barley but here he is &gt;&gt; he's the he he's he he's the seventh in in a mystery &gt;&gt; because he he had the seed &gt;&gt; that she needed. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know when when Ruth went back to Naomi and said, "Naomi," you know, Naomi says, "Tell me what took place &gt;&gt; between you." She says, "Well, he gave me six six measures of barley." She says, "Hallelujah." &gt;&gt; Well, hold on a minute here. This ain't OVER YET. &gt;&gt; THIS AIN'T OVER YET. &gt;&gt; There's something. There's a mystery here. &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of people read that and wondering what that's all about. Says, "No, no. This this thing is going to be finished. This mystery is going to be MADE KNOWN. IT'S GOING to be finished. Because when when when when somebody gives barley, when when a man gives six measures of barley to a woman, it's saying that he's going to be her provider. &gt;&gt; That he's that there's more coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, so, so Ruth, she she was a she was a gentile. &gt;&gt; She didn't have the understanding like Naomi had. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. But but all all she knew is that, you know, she she she was mesmerized by by by by Boaz, but so was Boaz mesmerized by her. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; BOAZ HAD A CHOICE. &gt;&gt; BOAZ KNEW THAT THERE was that there was going to be a redemption. Amen. That there was going to he'd be the he'd be the kinsman. Hallelujah. But he had to play the he had to play IT ALL OUT. HE HAD TO ALLOW, you know, the he called, you know, the the the the the the judges to come to the gate, you know, at the barley time. Amen. Right. At the evening time, you know, and and he gave the opportunity to another &gt;&gt; kinsman. &gt;&gt; But that kinsman was more interested in his current inheritance. He was more interested in what he had to deal with because he had children he wanted to give his his inheritance to. He didn't want to have to marry Ruth because a part of the redemption is that you got to take her as wife. When when when to to to redeem the land, you got to take the wife in order to bring forth an heir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. So what what is it? It was all mystery. It was all in mystery. But Boaz knew exactly what he was doing. &gt;&gt; And he knew that Ruth would be his prize. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Look at the woman at the well. It was in mystery. Here comes Jesus. I have need to go to Samaria. Goes to Samaria. Who's there? A woman comes to the well. Starts to talk to her. She's a gentile. Starts to talk to her. Tell her that she's got five husbands and the one she's with, the sixth, is not even hers. BUT THE SEVENTH WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE SPEAKING TO HER. You see that was the mystery and you WONDER WHY WHY WHY WHY DID HE GO TO THE woman at the well and she was the only one you know that she was the only one while he was here that he revealed I am he when she said you know when he started to tell her all about herself and her life and her prostitution and and you know when God started to tell you about all your your your your living and the way that you used to live and and and you know started to discern all the things in your life you knew that you would come into contact with something that was was supernatural. &gt;&gt; It wasn't IT WASN'T JUST, YOU KNOW, A CHURCH ALTAR CALL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Where there was a big gathering of people. No, this is personal. &gt;&gt; This is God speaking direct. &gt;&gt; He's he's discerning the very need that's in her heart. &gt;&gt; He knows the very need that's in your heart this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what does he DO? AND SHE SAYS WHEN MESSIAH COMES, he's going to he's going to do these things. AND HE SAYS, "IT IS I. I AM HE." He was revealing THE MYSTERY &gt;&gt; TO THE GENTILE PROSTITUTE. &gt;&gt; Such were you and I. &gt;&gt; But this mystery has been revealed. IT BURNS WITHIN OUR HEARTS. IT'S A REVELATION THAT WE CAN'T HELP. WHY? BECAUSE WE'VE COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE LIVING GOD. THE LIVING JESUS. [cheering] Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY TO GOD. LOOK AT MARY MAGDALENE. She goes to the grave &gt;&gt; right there. You know, you know, to to to find the body because, you know, SHE WAS GOING TO GET THE BODY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SHE they were going to bury the body and they were going to uh you know, she wanted to go see where the body was. She had heard. And she goes there and the and the mighty angel had come down and rolled away the stone. And here she is. And Mary was the one whom whom whom had seven devils cast out of her. That goes to tell you that every church age had demon power &gt;&gt; that need to be cast out, including this seventh church age &gt;&gt; because God is GOING TO CALL A CHURCH OUT OF THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. He's bringing a bride out of the church &gt;&gt; because that pale horse rider is still riding and deceiving the very people in this day and in this hour and in this message. &gt;&gt; But she will not be deceived. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Because the mighty angel has come down. &gt;&gt; He's resurrected. &gt;&gt; And she's going, "Uh, where have you put his body?" She didn't recognize that that was Jesus. She thought it was the gardener, but he says, "WHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR the living amongst the dead?" &gt;&gt; And she's going, "Yeah, but where have you PUT HIM?" AND THEN HE SAID, "MARY." And she went, &gt;&gt; "Lord," &gt;&gt; you see, IT WASN'T UNTIL her name was called that she came into an awakening. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And under this seventh mystery, under the opening of those thunders, under the the revealing of that SEVENTH SEAL IN THE BOOK of redemption, there's names. &gt;&gt; And your name is being called. How do you know your name's being called? &gt;&gt; What are you REJOICING ABOUT? &gt;&gt; WHAT ARE Y'ALL EXCITED ABOUT? &gt;&gt; What's what's what's so exciting about what I'm saying here? We've heard this story so many times. We've heard talk about how they went to the tomb and how they didn't find him and then the the the you know that the other disciples didn't believe and this and that. No, BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD AN AWAKENING. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT THAT SAME REVELATION in you of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU'VE COME INTO A REVELATION of this mighty angel that's come down in 1963 that's UNVEILING HIMSELF AND NOW moved into you and me. Praise our God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; All under a mystery. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal is still unfolding. &gt;&gt; Like we said, it's unveiling itself. Amen. It's going to it's going to continue. Listen, let's go to the next slide here in number 13. It says, he says, therefore, you can see the great meaning. Now, here brother Brandham speaking. He says, you can see the great meaning of what it's been to know this and to try to bring it to the people, the mystery. See, and then you don't I I haven't went into details to try to explain it as God has revealed it to me. Can you believe that? Brother Brandham was under that revelation of the seventh seal. Saw everything that we're talking about here. &gt;&gt; SAW ALL THE TYPES. THAT'S WHY HE BROUGHT IT OUT IN CHRIST is the mystery of God revealed. This message is the seventh seal. That's &gt;&gt; that whole message is is preaching the seventh seal about Christ and what is the mystery and here he is he's saying now you you could now do YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IT'S been for me to be able to see all that I've been seeing here but yet you know that while he was in the meetings while he was you know before he went to preach the seventh seal he says you know we're going to we're going to have questions and answers so that we can you know because I don't I think people are seeing what's really happening here &gt;&gt; and and you know even to the very point where where just like in this day and in this hour here he is the mighty angel himself but they want to put him just back into the tapes. &gt;&gt; They want to just put him they they they want to organize it and say no this is the only place this is the only voice there's no other voice it's only William Brother Brandham's voice that you need to listen to. No, no, no. I'm hearing the voice of my beloved this morning. &gt;&gt; I'm hearing his voice come through the word of God. I hear his voice when he speaks through the quotes. I hear his voice in the scripture. I hear his voice coming over the pulpit through the five-fold ministry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's the voice of my beloved. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT BOTTLED UP, BUT YET it's being silenced. [snorts] It's being revealed in silence. It's a mystery in your life. Your life is unfolding in such a way people look at it's a peculiar life they can't quite figure you out. Why? Because you're a dedicated son or daughter of God like Enoch. You know what the word Enoch means? Dedicated. &gt;&gt; Dedicated to what? To the word. &gt;&gt; And so he goes on here in quote 14. He says it goes right by them and they don't recognize it till it's gone. It's only It only picks up, listen now, it only picks up the predestinated seed that God predestinated before the foundations of the earth. &gt;&gt; Remember, this is not for everybody. &gt;&gt; Don't think you're going to convince everybody that you talk to. &gt;&gt; The minute this revelation comes in you and starts to speak out of you, &gt;&gt; you start to lose friends, not gain them. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're listen, if everybody loves you and everybody, you know, wants to be around you all the time and everybody thinks it's because there's something maybe you're not fully expressing &gt;&gt; in the word of God. Because when Jesus was on earth, he was not loved, &gt;&gt; especially when he spoke the word. &gt;&gt; And when that word starts to speak out of you and tell people, wait a minute, you you no you have not been baptized. What do you mean I haven't been baptized? Of course, I was baptized. Not according to the scripture. &gt;&gt; Do you believe the word of God? Yes, I believe the word. Okay, let me show you the word. Do you believe that every word is inspired by God? I had a I had a a a a a one-on-one conference not long ago with a Catholic priest and got right into this very element of what the Holy Ghost is and took every scripture and showed it right to him. I said, "Now, do you see how every scripture here now? Do you believe that every scripture is inspired of God?" Nope. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. The church has a say in this. I I was blown away. I was totally blown away. The word was so clear. But yet, so you see, they don't believe the word. &gt;&gt; And the moment that you tell them and you bring them to a place where the word bottles them in, &gt;&gt; they got to either say, "Amen." or they got to deny it. &gt;&gt; And that's why on that day when they go to knock to come in, Jesus is going to say, "I never knew you. &gt;&gt; I never knew you. Hallelujah. So here he says the same thing come through in the days of Noah. The same thing come through in the days of Moses, the days of Elijah, days of the prophets, days of Jesus on down to the very hour. the pregnant person with the seed of God, the word in there manifesting itself so surrendered to the will of God that the word and the word alone manifests itself in this person. They become what? A to the prisoner to an individual. Paul said one time, I am a prisoner of Christ. &gt;&gt; Why? because he became a prisoner to the word of God. It he says there's nothing that can separate me from this word. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that can separate me from the love of God. Amen. Glory to God. He says so he goes on here in the next quote. He says, "Not say my church to an individual." We finished off. Not say my church now my church has nothing to do with it. &gt;&gt; It's not the church you belong to. It's you belonging to Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's an individual, one person. All hell is against this teaching. All hell is against this truth. But it's the truth. Jesus never said, "Now Peter, you and John, and all the rest of the people, you've got the revelation. Now the whole church is saved." No, that's not what he said. Amen. This is a personal revelation. Paul, listen, Paul had a revelation. Peter had his own revelation. They all needed to have a personal revelation of the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And Paul, you know, he said, "I am persuaded." &gt;&gt; Are you persuaded? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you persuaded of the revelation that God has given you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. You know, you'll be tested in every way on whether you're truly persuaded. That's what the testing is all about. That's what the trials come into our lives for. God knows that that word that he placed inside of you, that attribute of himself, he placed it into a vessel. He knows that that vessel contains within it himself, but you don't fully understand it. And in order for that vessel, in order for that attribute to be expressed, GOD NEEDS TO SOMETIMES CRUSH THE VESSEL, &gt;&gt; he needs to kind of beat the the vessel down and and and and open up that earthn vessel so that it can express the life so that it can express the revelation of Jesus Christ is a reality to you that the word is your absolute. &gt;&gt; It's not something that you just decided to take on. That's what the That's what the uh you know the impersonators out there do. They thrive off of of off of the the popularity of the world and and and uh you know it's not revelation. It's it's uh you know it's um it's popularity. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; They don't want to have to identify with the word that that doesn't make you popular. &gt;&gt; They're feeding off of that that other uh you know spirit. Let's read it here. Genesis. Did you know there was another Enoch? Listen to this. And Cain, Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare Enoch. Now, this is not the Enoch that we're talking about. This is the Enoch that come from the son of Cain who killed his brother. Adam had two sons. One son actually, Abel. Cain was not the son of Adam. &gt;&gt; Cain was the son of the serpent. &gt;&gt; That's why he had the nature of his father. &gt;&gt; And look what he does. And he builded his now Cain. Cain, remember, Cain had his own revelation. Cain had a revelation of of of of uh what religion was all about. So what does he do? He builds a city. He builds the world. He builds a city where he can go and live and do and and be and and and and live uh you know because Cain had one problem. He had his own will. He wasn't he wasn't subject to the will of God. He had his own will. And so he would he would build cities. He would have a place where he could go and party and you know have nightclubs and you know you just go you just go back and follow the lineage of Cain you will see that through the lineage of Cain all the technology all the building techn all the science all the the worldly uh knowledge and and and to the levels of of of knowledge that we're in now that's all Cain's lineage &gt;&gt; it's all you know science and and and and and knowledge and understanding. It's a totally different world. But you know that Enoch, the real Enoch, the one that we're talking about that we're typing here, he was around at that time too cuz they lived for many, many years. So Enoch, he must have seen that city that Cain had built and seen what was going on in that city and the sin that was going on and was building up in that city. But the bride, she, you know, Enoch, he had no desire for it because in him was burning another city. &gt;&gt; God was giving him a revelation whose whose s whose builder and maker was God. &gt;&gt; He was he was interested in another city. &gt;&gt; He was interested in the one that that that is the future home that was being revealed to him that God while he was walking with God, God was unveiling revelation of this real city. But meanwhile, Cain had built his own city, and it was a city of self-will and self-desire and lust and passion. But you, such were you. Such were I. We we we were we were brought into this world and and and and we and we fed off of the things of the world. We desired the things of the world. But when that revelation come in you and called you into a walk with God, it dedicated you to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we see the similarities here. How this, you know, how Cain was an impersonator, the unbeliever, the makeeliever. Hallelujah. Same lineage as the serpent. Glory to God. But the Enoch that was the seventh from Adam, there's that seventh mystery again. You know, Enoch was a mystery. And he unveiled himself in the seventh church age. He was the seventh from Adam. Amen. He was diff. He was a different lineage. He came from the lineage of the image of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. He had representation in Adam, not in Cain. His revelation was to build a city whose builder and maker was God. Hallelujah. He had a complete revelation of the mystery of God. His name dedicated. Let's read the next scripture. And have you not read this scripture? The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner. This was the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes. Hallelujah. Praise God. Listen, brother Brandham here. He says here in to take on the whole armor of God. And now we're talking about the capstone. And we're talking about, you know, how how you fit into it all. Amen. I haven't got my purse, he says. But did you ever notice on the back of an American dollar over on one side, it's got the American seal, a eagle with the arrows in its claws, the American seal. But in the other corner that faces you, I believe the right hand corner, he's got a pyramid and he's got wrote under there the great seal. Can you imagine that the US there was an inspiration on the US because at one time the US was was built on in God we trust. &gt;&gt; They they they believed God. There was there was men of God that had revelation that that that believed the word of God that knew and understood the purpose of God, you know, that that that had, you know, filtered down from those that had come down through the ages that were believers that that that were revelated by the word of God. And he says, "Now, why would our nation would think of making it an Egyptian pyramid, the great seal above even our seal of American eagle?" Did you notice just above the mir the pyramid is a headstone above it like an eye shining through? That was the great seal of God. It's even going to be uh it's going to come right back into their face when this culmination all takes place and the revelation of of the of the of the capstone ministry comes and manifests through the lives of people that are going to be translated from this earth. It's all going to be there. It's all going to be as a witness. God was everywhere. God built this pyramid as a witness &gt;&gt; to let them know that he is God &gt;&gt; and that there's no other religion. There's no other teaching. &gt;&gt; It there's no other uh there there's nobody that can be placed before God. He is the one and only true and living God. Every religion will be will will be rebuked &gt;&gt; when they come to see this monument of God &gt;&gt; that he's built called the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. He goes on to say, he says, "Now I've been to Egypt." Next slide. He says, "And in those pyramids, how I could take all afternoon." Now, I don't believe in doctrines of pyramids. I love that when he said that. I don't believe in this. It's like he knew that there would be some doctrines that would come down the road, you know, that that people would take this pyramid and they would make it a doctrine. We're not making it a doctrine. We are rec we are recognizing it as a revelation and a type of the mighty God unveiling himself in the whole plan of redemption. Amen. We're not making it any kind of a of a of a doctrine. Amen. I'm only making a parable. He says here, "But as you notice that pyramid, it never did receive the stone. Enoch built Enoch built that pyramid in his days. They can't figure it out." Now, they got all kinds of religions on it like they have in the zodiac, but everything God wrote three Bibles. The first one is in the heavens, the second one was in the pyramid, and the third one is on earth. And every one of them agree with one another. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God's got three as a witness &gt;&gt; that he is God. &gt;&gt; He is the one and only true and living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And there's a people on the earth in this day and in this hour that will stand dedicated to that word. &gt;&gt; That will declare the Lord thy God is one. &gt;&gt; There is no other gods before me. NO OTHER GODS BESIDE ME. NO OTHER GODS after me. Amen. He is the Lord God Almighty. HE HE'S NOT IN the He's not in the New Age movement. No, sir. He's not in the in the in the Buddhist teachings. He's not in the in the OH MY GOD, THERE'S so many DIFFERENT TEACHINGS. HE'S NOT EVEN IN all the doctrines of the Christian churches out there. They've come up with so many different interpretations on him. He says, "I never knew you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never knew. Why? because he never placed himself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He never placed his seed in them. When when when Adam knew his wife is because he injected his seed into Eve to bring forth of his kind, &gt;&gt; sons and daughters of God. You know, in looking at this pyramid, this this uh uh altar of God, this uh witness of God, we want to look at it just, you know, just look at certain aspects of it and see because we're looking at the types here, right? You know, the pyramid of Giza sits at the exact center of the earth. It's a proven fact. They've gone, they've checked it geographically. They've checked it from the from the from from above. They've looked at the access to every single thing. It runs exactly and it's sitting perfectly at the center of the earth. Why? Because he's the center of all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. The exact chapter of the very center of the Bible, okay? And I I think I've mentioned this before and you know, but is is Psalms 118 verses 22 and 23. And you know what it says there? It says in Psalms 118, which is the very chapter that is the exact center of the entire Bible. There's so many chapters to the left, so many chapters to the right. This one is dead center. It says in verse 22, the stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner. This is the Lord's doing. It is marvelous in our eyes. Oh, glory to God. Let me tell you, saints, this revelation of Enoch, this revelation of the mystery of God, this revelation of where God is, who God is, who it's it's it's marvelous. &gt;&gt; It's it's been done by God himself. Only God could do this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. Listen, Isaiah 19:19, he says here, look, even Jesus himself uh you know referenced this very scripture, okay? Um in in uh in the one that in the one that we read in Mark, okay, and what did it say? In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the midst of the land of Egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to the Lord. This is Isaiah 19:19, okay? Talking about this altar. In that day, there will be an altar. This I believe this was the altar. This pyramid was the identification of God's type to the world of what his word was going to produce in in in the fulfillment of all scripture. And it is truly in the midst of Egypt. Okay? like the scripture says, in the midst of the land of Egypt and a pillar at the border thereof. Okay? And you know, I was reading an article and I got this article from 1999. It's called End Times Bible Report on the Great Pyramid. And I just pulled certain things out of it that I thought were very interesting and we can and and we can see how it, you know, they they they tapped into things, but they couldn't fully understand. But the wise shall know in the end time. Amen. And you know, and it goes on to say here, he says in this report, it says, "How can something be in the middle and also at the border?" First of all, the great pyramid is a monument situated near Gue Giza in Egypt. And the word Giza in Arabic means border. That's what it means. Henry Mitchell, chief hydrog hy hydrographer of the United States Coastal Survey, uh, discovered an additional clue to this riddle while working on the report for the Suez Canal in 1868. He noticed that the Nile Delta is pieshaped like a pyramid. Plotting the sector on a map, he found that the Great Pyramid of Giza is at the exact center of that of that Nile Delta which is exactly at the border in the midst of Egypt. So the scriptur is giving the the word of God. It's clear the measurement used by the builders. Now listen to this and in this whole report I want you to know something in this whole four-page report they never mention Enoch once. So just understand that the measurements used by the builders the pyramid cubit when divided into the base length of the great pyramid is exactly 365.242 pyramid cubits. Isn't that interesting? You see Enoch had a perfect revelation of the word of God. And God placed that perfect revelation in Enoch in that Enoch lived 365 years &gt;&gt; and then he was not &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Precisely the number of days. They say this they they they reference it precisely to the number of days in a year. Right. &gt;&gt; But when I saw it, I said, "Yeah, and that's exactly how many years Enoch lived." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The scientific and mathematical features built into this pyramid could only have been known by the architect of the universe. This is what they said. They don't know of any architect or any technology or of any science or any way, ability, shape or form that these pyramids could have been built. But listen to what they say. Indeed, most pyramids were built as tombs. However, there is an abundant proof that the Great Pyramid is unique and was not intended as a tomb. Just instructions were given just as instructions were given to Noah for the building of the ark and to Moses for the assembling of the tabernacle. We submit that God gave instructions for the construction of the pyramid that it might testify in the last days as to his infinite wisdom and fornowledge. &gt;&gt; Like I said, they never mention Enoch at all. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. But finally here Taylor was assisted in his conclusions by the writings of the ancient historians Herod Doatus and Manthol. They recorded that Egyptians helped to build the great pyramid under the direction, now pay attention, of a shepherd king named Felitis. Mantho himself, an Egyptian, wrote, "There came up from the east in a strange manner men of in noble race who had the confidence to invade our country and easily subdue it by their power without a battle." These humble peaceful invaders were styled were were were styled haikoso that is shepherd kings. He then related how afterwards they departed for Judea and built a city there named Jerusalem. Another possibility and these are these are their theories but pay attention. you've got the revelation to draw out of it what is truth and what is not. Another possibility is that this shepherd king was Shem, a faithful son of Noah, also known as Malchzdc, the king of Salem. Peace Jerusalem. Shem would have been alive in the time of the building of the great pyramid. This and other evidence points to a non-Egyptian architect and builder of the Great Pyramid and one that was closely associated with the God of the Bible. Well, they kind of mixed up Shem with Enoch &gt;&gt; because it was Enoch that was given the revelation. Enoch had supernatural power, supernatural ability to place those stones, to place every one of those stones into their perfect position. &gt;&gt; It could only have been by a supernatural God that this pyramid, this altar of God was actually built. &gt;&gt; And now the top of the Great Pyramid, the top of the Great Pyramid, once crowned by by a capstone, is missing. Now, brother Brandham says that it never got capped, but they're saying when they built other pyramids, what they would do is they would put a limestone casing stone and they were stripped away over the centuries. That's what they believe, you know, from earthquakes and everything else with the capstone left to erode at the top. Okay. Now this apex element possibly made of gold covered electrum was designed to reflect sunlight but it vanished long before modern times leaving only a weathered remnants. Okay, so we know that you know the cap stone is not there. You know, they talk about potentially being looted and everything else, but here what we want to look at is that the that there was that they were using a a t it's called Torah limestone, which they could actually it was it was so fine that they could polish it so brilliant that the sun would actually reflect off of it. And this pyramid, even brother Brandham said it in in a quote that this pyramid was placed perfectly at the center of the earth to where all the sides that when the sun came up, it would not cast a shadow anywhere. &gt;&gt; Because the sun was the perfect reflection of God. &gt;&gt; And there's no shadow in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's only types. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he is God. He's the one and only and the true and living God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So here he goes and and he here's the quote here where he says it. I didn't put it up there. He says, "We don't have engineers like like they had. That great pyramid in Egypt is so perfect in the center of the earth. No matter where the sun is, they're never a shadow around it." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. It's known that the limestone that they would use would be polished to the point where the sun would perfectly reflect off of it. Let's go to the next quote. We're winding it down here. In God's only provided place of worship, look, Enoch was the living word of God of his age. &gt;&gt; He was a prophet. A prophet is God's reflector. You see, now we're talking about Enoch being that capstone because this is the capstone now that we're talking about. He was the mystery. Enoch was displaying God in the full completion of this pyramid. And a prophet is God's reflector. How many knows that &gt;&gt; the reflector doesn't reflect itself. The reflector isn't the reflection. There has to be something strike the reflector. The reflector to make it reflect. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, a prophet is a chosen vessel of God that cannot reflect nothing at all. But he's in direct line with that reflection. &gt;&gt; And what was his reflection? The prophet of Malachi 4, the prophet of Revelations 10:1-7. He was the reflection of the word of God that came down in 1963 &gt;&gt; to reflect the image of Christ, the word. See, nothing else can do it. And then he goes on next slide. He says, "And you are a reflector." That's the reason the prophet had to eat the book. That's the reason he had to eat the scroll. He had to reflect the word that was for the age for that age. You got it? Notice Enoch, God's perfect reflector in type. When God was through through with him, he just translated him, took him up. the mechanics that he had reflected become dynamics with the spirit and took him up. Amen. Listen, when this word becomes so real to you and the dynamics and the revelation and the stimulation OF THE WORD BY YOU RECOGNIZING who you are in the WORD OF GOD, WHAT YOUR PART IS IN THE WORD OF GOD, HOW YOU IDENTIFY WITH THIS WORD in this hour, you will have that dynamic energy burst that will in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, translate you &gt;&gt; into another dimension. Let the musicians come. This revelation is perfect faith. When you see yourself in the word, it becomes so real to you that you are united and dedicated to walk with God, &gt;&gt; which is what? To walk with the word. And what does that do? It pleases God. Amen. Let's read the next scripture here in slide 23. By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For before his translation he had this testimony &gt;&gt; that he pleased God. &gt;&gt; But without faith it's impossible to please him. &gt;&gt; For he that cometh to God must believe that he is. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A GOD THAT WAS. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT TALKING about a God that's in the future. You got TO BELIEVE THAT GOD IS IN 2026 interested in your life, in your walk with him, that you THAT HE WANTS YOU TO DEDICATE yourself to him and walk with him so that your revelation becomes pleasing. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS BRIDE has the ability to walk. &gt;&gt; How? Listen, you can't walk with God unless you're in agreement with God. &gt;&gt; You must be in agreement with the word. Somebody comes to you and says, "Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ." And you say, "No, I was baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost." You're in disagreement with the word. &gt;&gt; If you're going to walk with God and please God, you got to walk with God. You got to walk with the word because God is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Enoch could only walk with God if they were in agreement. How can two walk together unless they both be agreed? Hallelujah. Glory to God. Amen. You just look at, you know, when we read the scripture there, and Enoch walked with God and he was not &gt;&gt; and God took him. I looked at the word took and I looked it up and and the in the Hebrew it's lack. And it and the and the basic definitions is to take to take in hand or receive. And then it goes and in marriage to take a woman in marriage snack, snatch or catch away. Hallelujah. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, he's going to He He took Enoch. He He took you. &gt;&gt; He's already took you out of the world. &gt;&gt; You don't realize that you've already been united. &gt;&gt; You've already come into that invisible union. You're already married to Christ. You're You're not foolish. The reason why he took you is because you were the the wise virgin. You heard the bridegroom call. Amen. And you and you received it. So, can you imagine that after the pyramid was built, everyone was looking and saying, "Hey, where's the capstone? Hey, Enoch, like today, where is the coming of the Lord?" &gt;&gt; Meanwhile, Enoch was right there in their midst who had the full revelation of Christ. &gt;&gt; And he was right there in their midst, walking in the midst of the people. &gt;&gt; You see, this bride has Enoch's revelation. She has the capstone revelation. &gt;&gt; We're going to be looking a little deeper into that next week. Amen. And it was Enoch all the time. Now, today, the bride has the capstone in her. And she is reflecting the very image of the word, walking with the word. And in this final quote here, I want to read it in the exposition of the seven church ages in the the the Pergamian church age. He says the very same law applies to the church today. He's talking about the seed that's in there. Whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the original seed because it is the same seed. In these last days, the true bride church, Christ's seed, will come to the headstone &gt;&gt; and she will be the super church and a super race as she nears him. &gt;&gt; She will have the word in her. The word can only respond to the word. That's why no matter what somebody tries to pull you away from the word, somebody tries to give you a teaching on on new age movement or some kind of you know, oh Jesus was a master. He achieved a certain No, no. Jesus is the God of almighty universe. Period. The absolute &gt;&gt; Jesus is the word. Before there was before there was even a word, he existed. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the He's the He's the self-existent one. But they but without that revelation because listen that is the key to the rapture. &gt;&gt; Did you know that the key to the rapture is to know who the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead is and that it dwells in you and that it's quickening you. That is the revelation. Satan's revelation is is is the is the revelation of of mystery Babylon of organized religion. That's his That's his mystery. You know, Satan, the mystery of Babylon. Christ, the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. You see, we need to recognize the seed that we're of. And he goes on and he says here in the in the next slide, he says, "They and the bride will be so much like him that they will even be in his very image." This is in order to be united with him. &gt;&gt; Praise our God. &gt;&gt; They will be one. They will be the very manifestation of the word of the living God. &gt;&gt; Denominations cannot [music] produce this. &gt;&gt; They're the wrong seed. &gt;&gt; Their seed is based on the doctrines of men. They'll take a man's [music] teaching over the word. And what does it do? They produce their creeds, [music] their dogmas. They mixed it with the word. And what does it bring forth? Hybrid [music] religion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. May the Lord quicken these thoughts [music] to our hearts. Bring us into a greater understanding of our placing in the word of God and how we represent that capstone age and how we [music] are the capstone in the midst of the people not realizing and [music] recognizing what God is doing. How many desires a closer walk with him? wants to walk with Jesus. [music] Amen. Let's sing that song. Just a closer walk. &gt;&gt; Just closer [music] to walk [singing] with the &gt;&gt; Is that your desire today? Granted, Jesus [music] is my daily walking [music and singing] close to thee.
