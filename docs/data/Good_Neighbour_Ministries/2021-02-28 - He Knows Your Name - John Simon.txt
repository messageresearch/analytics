TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] good morning friends god richly bless you it is with joy that i come this morning to speak to you in the name of the lord may the lord jesus christ bless us all as we gather around his wonderful and blessed holy word thank god how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the ointment that ran down aaron's beard to the very skirts of his garments lord bless us all praise god i would i speak today on this wonderful subject he knows your name let me repeat my subject today is he knows your name our scripture is found in john chapter 10 that is the gospel of john chapter 10 reading from verse 1 to 5 verily verily i say unto you he that enter it not by the door into the sheepfold but climb it up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but he that enter it in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him they porter open it and the sheep hear his voice and he call it his own sheep by name and leaded them out and when he put it forth his own sheep he go it before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers thank god for the reading of his blessed word let us pray dear ones dear god our righteous and gracious heavenly father we ask that the great holy spirit will come bless us and anoint us from on high send down the blessings upon us of the word of god inspiration opening the eyes of our understanding the doors of our heart to receive your truth father and to worship you with all our hearts in the name of jesus christ amen and amen now down in ancient judea it must have been just before daybreak that mary came to the tomb of jesus john chapter 20 the bible tells us how that she came to that tomb and she was sad for her lord had died like many today believing that it's all dead but as she went to the door of the tomb there were two young men sitting by the tomb and they said what seek ye if you're seeking jesus he's not here for he is risen praise god hallelujah he's risen from the dead and with that she turned away from them to go on her way back to the city and as she turned she saw one standing there the bible tells us that she thought that he was the gardener and she said sir do you know where they might have put my lord right you know so she's saying that to him and the gardener spoke the gardener the one she sought was the gardener spoke and said mary and the bible said she spun around and looked at him and she said oh my lord she recognized him from his voice and from him calling her name this one knew her name and you know the reaction of anybody when your name is called even in a massive crowd it catches your attention it causes you to turn around from whatever life you might be living whatever way you may be going the calling of your name arrests your attention and brings you back to yourself and to your thinking now when brother william marion branham was alive he being the 20th prophet century prophet that god sent to the gentiles now you'll speak for everyone but in particular profit to the gentiles with a message to the gentile era and to call out a people for his name and to bring the faith of the children back to the fathers many times [Music] why tia lost burn or roberts many others got their ministry from seeing god working through the life of this great servant prophet of the almighty god if you have never seen the video of him on the deep calls to the deep it would be a great blessing for any pastor to play that video or any believer to watch that video and it would be a great blessing to your soul oh many times he would stand up on the platform you will see it in that video the deep calls to the deep and he would begin to discern the hearts and thoughts of the people by a divine gift given to him by god when god said as moses was given two gifts to lead the people out of natural egypt so i give you these gifts to lead the people from spiritual egypt bondage and the light praise god so here it was that he would stand on the platform and they would bring a person to him might be a woman or a man and he would look at them under the vine anointing and discernment of the holy spirit he would say oh uh you you you're a you're a christian you're some sort of a of a teacher of the bible oh i see you're a minister you your name is miss so-and-so or mr so-and-so you'll tell them their name and you live at this address and you'll give them the number of the address five four three two one so a name the street name the city wherever that person would be living and then he'll say and you came here because you got a letter saying that your daughter is in a terrible state and she needs prayer for this this this and he'll name what it was what was in the letter and the person would say yes yes that's true and then he'll say but that's not all you came for her but you are also suffering and he'll tell them what they're suffering from and then he will turn around and say thus saith the lord you are healed by the power of god and a person would be healed by the power and the presence of god the blind to see the lame to walk the sick and the despairing praise god hallelujah crippled praise god would be set free by the power of almighty god even know the names for instance brother brady in the nation state of jamaica many years ago was in one of brother branham's meetings and he was a pentecostal at that time his wife wrote him a letter and she told me this herself but it's also something he has testified to how that she had pains in her left foot and it was swollen up to a size and the doctors couldn't find what it was and there was nothing they could do about it so she was at home laying in that bed in the dark of that bedroom and he was in the united states in the meetings and while in the meetings brother branham preaching and then he suddenly stopped and said uh sir pointing to brother brady do you believe me to be god's prophet god's servant and brother brady said yes sir i do he says i see water you are not from here oh go back to jamaica mr brady your wife's left foot is healed thus saith the lord glory to god hallelujah and the sister tells how that the great pillar of fire of god seemed like it came out of the wall and passed over the bed went through the other wall and up she comes out of that bed and lived a full healthy whole life until the day she died you see god under the second pull of the holy spirit was displaying not to the whole world but in particularly to his own to his seed to his elected amen displaying to them that no matter how many thousands billions of people that you are in i know your name i know where you come from i know your conditions i know your situations hallelujah he knows my friends all about you even now while i'm speaking he knows all your unspoken situations and conditions and he knows your name how wonderful it was to see the holy spirit acting through the prophet the holy spirit discerning the names the addresses calling out the people and letting them know that he knew them praise god and i want you to say where you are standing sitting believing the word of god that same holy spirit is available today and just as then jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i tell you in the name of jesus christ he knows your name he knows your situation you are not alone but we serve a god who knows every one of us yes under the second poll god was demonstrating for us to understand that just as much as he knew the name of the people and persons under the natural or in the natural realm that he god no matter how long his children in time have gone from him centuries thousands of years billions of people and seem as if they are lost in a world of of all kinds of things around them yet he is letting us know in the midst of all this i know your name i call you by your name and god still knows our names matter of fact he said not one all that are in my hands i will not lose not one of them praise god hallelujah god knows not just your natural name to call you out by your natural name but god knows your spiritual or your secret name as written in the book of revelations i will give you a new name praise god hallelujah and hear my friends that name is a secret between you and him he says it's a name you were given by him before the foundation of the world hallelujah one time he said to the disciples i had joy with you before the foundations of the world another place he says my sheep know my voice just like mary recognize his voice he said my sheep know my voice and a stranger they will not follow and he turned around not only will they recognize his voice when they hear it but he says i know my sheep and i call them by their names hallelujah he knows every single one of us not by your natural name but he knows you by your name praise god even when the seals are open not by your name james jim or susan or barbara or whatever your name is but your supernatural name given by god to you before the foundation of the world and that is a part of this word so that when the word is preached and it's revealed and opens up itself it is calling out your name by that part that represents you in the bible praise god hallelujah amen praise god i call them by their name and they follow me praise god amen that is why he alone can call you by that name glory to god not church voice can call you no denomination can call you no great personage no holy pope pontiff patriarch or whatever can call you only he can call you by your secret name the name that god gave you and knows you by before the foundation of the world praise god for he alone by knowing that name he alone holds the key to the locket of your heart in the old days some of the men would make a locket for their wife or the wife may make one for her husband and in the locket would be a picture of that person that they hold dear and they would have a tiny key to that locket and it would be a person would wear it and on their chest hallelujah but i want to say that our hearts are the locket and he stamps his word and his presence upon our heart and our new our name is in that locket only he can take the key of the revealed word and open up the doorways of the lockets of your heart hallelujah oh praise god where he is now calling you by your secret name praise god the book of revelation he says i am he who holds the key of david i open and no man shut and if i lock no man can open but thank god he has opened your heart he has opened my heart he has opened together our hearts in the lord where we can rejoice in the presence of god with open hearts giving glory and honor and praise to his mighty and wonderful name amen praise god hallelujah now in the bible there were examples of god calling people and letting them know that he knows their name god called in genesis abraham he just heard the voice calling him amen there was moses he just heard the voice out of the burning bush saying moses moses oh praise god you know the story he turns around and there's a pillar of fire burning in the bush and the bushes not burned the word of god comes into your life fills it up and the fire of god burns within your soul you are not you are not burnt up you are still standing there only the evil the sin the rottenness that is burnt up but you are there hallelujah to bear witness and record of the word of god oh hallelujah amen praise god the same god samuel was just a child in the temple and there he was in the temple and in the depths of the temple he heard the voice samuel samuel and he did not know who was calling him so he went and said i heard this voice calling me and he was advised go back do your duties and if you ever hear that voice again say answer and say lord here am i praise god which he did and you know his calling to be god's prophet so was it with gideon that gideon was poor he was humble and he lived in the nation of israel and while on the threshing floor an angel appeared to gideon and the angel said hail mighty man of valor thou mighty man of god and i guess gideon must have looked behind him because he knew what type of person he was uh and hid himself the bible says he hid himself amongst the the straw we were so scared but says no you are the mighty man of god hallelujah you see what man calls weak god calls mighty what man thinks is foolish god calls wise what man just pushes aside the rejected stone becomes the head of the corner the things men will fail to recognize god recognizes you may be comforted as a nobody nobody has respect regard push the side shut to the side everything else but in the eyes of god you're a child of the king hallelujah you're a son you're a daughter of the living god and he knew you yes he knew you he knew me oh praise his wonderful precious name amen so was it with jeremiah he said jeremiah before you were in your mother's belly i knew you and i called you to be a prophet amen glory to god hallelujah so was it my brother sister with nathaniel jesus showing that he was the same god he wanted the people to know giving them a literal insight that he was not just the man standing there but he says he says all as nathaniel he says oh you are nathaniel and before philip called you when you were under the fig tree i saw you amen glory to god hallelujah oh yes he knew me yes he knew you my friends and that's why he is here calling you to attention of himself the word god wants you to recognize him change your life your lifestyle your walk and your way and be a new creature a new creation living under your new name in jesus christ hallelujah praise god when jesus was there with us peter he said thou art simon what do you say i the son of man ham peter caught the revelation he said i there's some say you're jeremiah some say you're isaiah's some say you're a great teacher whatever but he said but who do you say individual revelation now individual who do you say i am and peter said thou art the christ hallelujah the son of the living god amen the body god is dwelling in today in other words and jesus said flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father in heaven has revealed this unto you and upon this rock this rock of what revelation of jesus christ who he is amen upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it upon this this marvelous uh ability god-given ability to of the reception of revelation upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it hallelujah the same god said from this day your name is not simon but your name shall be called peter rock hallelujah praise his name he called him by his real name that god knew him by he called them by their names you can go down the line cornelius paul the apostle you called him saul amen but here it was later he was called by the lord himself lord of god and put them into service praise god hallelujah and he's calling you and i now to put us into service he's not calling us to sit around and fill the pews in the church but god tell my disciples i'm risen from the dead i'm alive forevermore i am he that liveth and was dead and well and i'm alive forevermore first and the last beginning and the end alpha omega praise god one god hallelujah and bearing testimony of him that is what god wants every single one of us to do no matter how young we are or how old we are wherever we are god wants to use us and to put us into service right now to do his perfect will now in first corinthians chapter 2 verses 6 to 11 it reads thus habit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew where had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written i had not seen nor air heard neither had it entered into the heart of man the things which god has prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us how by his spirit where the spirit searches all things yey the deep things of god for what man not the things of man save the spirit of man which is in him even saw the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of almighty god hallelujah friends our names as the scripture tells us was a hidden mystery of god hidden within himself the word the man's sea the man's life germ is in him praise god we were in him and so our spiritual name was hidden in him but he knew our names people called us all manner of other names but god knew our names this bride then our names were hidden and put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and then sealed up from the eyes of satan and all of his imps demons and devils everywhere but thank god we've come to the hour when it's now being revealed with the opening up of the mystery of the seven seals what a great thing in our day and in our time hallelujah my friends let us be certain of god as the old song said is my name written there on the page white and fair in the book of thy kingdom is my name written there let us be certain of god cry out to god and ask god's forgiveness cleansing and his his certainty give you the ash blessed assurance that you are one of his and he is yours oh praise god and together we are one in him for if your name is not in that lamb's book of life the book of redemption before the foundation of the world then listen jesus said deception coming on the earth and it would deceive all those whose names are not written in the land's book of life from before the foundation of the world and if the person's name even for the elected would be deceived if it were possible but it's not possible it's impossible for they are actually a part of god hallelujah and god can't be deceived about himself and so you cannot be deceived about your real self hallelujah not what we present to man and man can see on the outside but you knows you in the inside you are known better to your own self and the holy spirit who knows you and calls you by your name praise god hallelujah so our names if you are his one of his elect your name is written in the lamb's book of life from before the foundations of the world but was hid in the book sealed in that book glory to god hallelujah but this great r has come to us that was predicted that it would come hallelujah that when the seals are thrown open then the names that are in the book will be made known would be revealed the summit will bring them joy and to other sorrow and deep despair oh praise god the word opens up it reveals the true and the false the black and the white the this that or truth and error it begins to reveal and you see yourself matching to that word like a hand into a glove perfectly fitting the word fits your soul the word fits you and you know it nobody has to tell you you don't need a bishop to tell you you don't need some high priest to tell you you you your spirit bear witness and record of the word of god and you believe it because it's it's right here you can see it feel it and it's real realized and revealed to you that you know yourself hallelujah amen and annoying yourself you realize you are a part of him that is now revealed praise god when the holy spirit begins to reveal and speak to people hearts like that and they begin to recognize who they truly are then god's spirit begins calling out to them and it doesn't matter look i was in africa preaching the word of god like this to the people there and one young man caught the revelation the denomination he was in they were they want to give him a car a brand new car they want to give him a house they will give him a ready-made church a building with people already there nothing but the holy spirit to use him but a power of god and by the power of the holy spirit to do something for god's glory amen you know what that young man put it all aside and walked away with god's despised few or bearing the reproach for the name of jesus christ and he was not ashamed and held to god's unchanging hand and god moved and bless him praise god amen i want to thank god that he's the same yesterday today and forever friends wherever you are revelation the book of has come out from from her my people come out of mystery babylon the confusion of denomination come out from amongst them be not partakers of our plates be not any partakers of our plagues because i'm going to judge her and if you are partaking of our place i'll judge you too so he's saying come out while there is yet time to come flee to christ while there is yet time to flee oh praise god forevermore amen i'm trusting god that while i'm speaking somehow the holy spirit who knows not time nor space for he being eternal god is able to reach you where you are oh and today may that same holy spirit call out to your soul may you hear the cry and the call of the holy spirit yonder while the seal of god is being broken and revealed to you into the me and whoever hallelujah that your name is over there i said your name is over there on the page white and fair in the book of this kingdom your name is over there only believe all things are possible to them that will believe somebody say glory to god hallelujah somebody shout amen amen somebody praise god forevermore oh my name is on the page white and fair and i give him all the glory and all the other hair today amen praise god hallelujah now you know names are associated with natures the moment you said tiger tiger is the nature of that beast if you say snake the name tells you the nature not just the name just by the name stands alone but the name reflects and tells you the nature of it praise god hallelujah praise god just like in the church ages the word the name of the church at smyrna smyrna means bitter and that was the character of that particular age just as jacob in the bible his name met supplanter as we will say smart man oh cunning a con man jacob supplanter but when he met the lord god says your name is no more jacob commands a planter or anything like that your name shall because israel amen praise god he got a new name praise god god changed his name just like saul saul riding down in the hot damascus sun going down to meet the lord's people to put them next to the sword and there a bright and shining light brighter than the midday sun came down upon him and out of the light he heard a voice saying saul saul why persecutest thou me and there he raised up and said who art thou lord because the light struck him off his horse and he bit the dust like many high and mighty people instead of being humble praise god become humble and walk the way god wants you to walk and do what god wants you to do praise god what is the use of wealth prosperity or knowledge unless it's surrendered to god that he can use it for his glory and for his honor and here his name later was called change to paul for you going to be my light to the gentiles you're going to be a reflection of me of the bright and shining light you're going to be a reflection of that light you will be a light to the gentiles praise god hallelujah and so you see your name bear some impression upon your character that is why i wouldn't name my daughter jezebel i would name my daughter delilah because there's meanings behind names and the names called down the spirit and the nature upon people praise god so friends it's important that we recognize these things amen as i mentioned before we all respond to our names even if our back is turned and someone calls it causes you to look around praise god hallelujah but he knows your the name of his attributes the attributes the genes that were in him before the foundation of the world he knows the names of those attributes psalms 147 verse 4 the bible tells us let's talk about job first he says job he says stand up gird up your waist like a man where were you when the morning stars sang together and the sons of god were shouting for joy oh praise god hallelujah now listen what he says in psalms 147 4. how that he tell it the number of the stars he knows the number of all of his children hallelujah of all the stars and he call up those stars by their names hallelujah thank god hallelujah no matter what the world says you're in god's eyes you're a star i said no matter what the world will say to you you're a star and he knows your name for he calleth the stars by name amen praise god amen my friends you know why god calls you by your real true spiritual name though you might not hear it as earthly men would call it a name but you know that it's your spiritual nature your name being pulled attracted drawn by the holy spirit hallelujah glory to god amen why does he reveal your name to you so that we could have recognized and come to ourselves wake up to realize we were living under a kind of a false name you see satan is a a kidnapper and satan kidnapped every single one of us and give us a earthly name of the flesh might be a nice name but nevertheless it's a human name and while we are here in this body we go by that name because that's how we are recognized but i'm just telling you that in god's eyes he knows your real name but satan while you're here it causes you to live under a false name that he puts on you so that you won't know your real parent right and he will give you a name of drug abuser give you a name of drug addict give your name of lust a name of selfishness give you a false name of a witch or wizard witchcraft worker give you a name you pervert perverted give you a name that you're just nothing but an alcoholic which in it is alcoholic demons got a hold of you and hold you in bondage kidnap you and hold you into bondage oh my they'll give you the name of a smoker a tobacco demon got a hold of your life and change you by to him and there you are bound by him put a sex demon upon you and put you into a life of male or female prostitution and living a life like that he could have put a money hungry demon on you and cause you to just be greedy and grasping nothing is wrong with one wanting to better themselves being ambitious having a better life having more money or whatever god will provide you for he promised he would prosper us but the fact is my friends he says you've got to put god first seek first the kingdom of god and all other things will be added on to you and we surrender all we are all we ever you ever found my friends that a lot of poor people are high and mighty and stuck up with themselves and they're really rich not those who think they're rich or maybe a little bit rich they begin to be pompous and arrogant and think of themselves high and mighty and they're real humble people the real really wealthy you know like warren buffett still plays drafts or dominoes with his friends dressed in ordinary worn-out clothes on the side of the street down in the town that he lives in and if one were to pass by they'd never know who he was think of it praise god right in jamaica i was in a bookstore and michael chin was in there buying magazines and i didn't recognize who he was at the time began talking with him uh about the uh magazines that were there and only when he started to walk away then i recognized who he was went around his business so humble and so simple you would not recognize who he is you're really wealthy never carry themselves in that kind of a haughty way and whenever they do they're not really anybody they have no character they have no real self my man they're not dedicated anything else but to money and to self oh my friends so it is that we respond to our names that god knew his attributes by that are a part of this word hallelujah and so there's an association between our name in the book of redemption and our natural name and that's the fight paul was talking about between the natural and the spiritual the flesh and the spirit the inner man and the outer man and so on that's not my subject today but that's the fight that goes on because the names carry nature with them amen praise god hallelujah amen when the newborn comes really comes into your life you less and less respond to to that old name of that old nature that false name that worldly name that the devil tried to put on you that all kidnapper all the word comes and frees you and you break your chains you're set free by the power of god your walk out of the devil's prison house oh my god thank god i am free i'm free from this world of sin i've been washed in the blood of jesus christ and i'm now born again hallelujah i'm saved saved by his wonderful grace brother sister aren't you happy today that you can say i am one of them glory to god hallelujah i thank god and praise him and magnify him for what he has done within my life glory to god thank god he calls us by our name adam adam where are you the bible tells us in the beginning of the bible the book of genesis god called adam hallelujah and god is calling you oh my wherever you are whoever you are the same spirit from the beginning of the world is here again same yesterday today now and forevermore calling out to you to know him in the power of his resurrection hallelujah i'm so glad that in this day when they're hearing they're stealing people's identification or identity on uh in computers and in the digital realm and many people have to go and struggle to get back their real identification and even so is the devil stealing your real identification and giving the entire world a totally different impression of who you really are but the holy spirit of god is here to set every captive free for the lion of the tribe of judah will break every chain and give to us the victory again and again glory to god hallelujah i'm so happy that he the great one is here with us glory to god here's a poem written by a brother anointed by the holy spirit hearing this thought about he knows our names there once was a woman who came to a well to quench her thirst by reputation she was considered the worst on that day she found more than water for she met the savior of the world she left town with one name for water but they were surprised when she returned with another that's what she said and here is what she said when she returned my name is sanctified and holy call me the righteousness of god i am now known as the new creation my nickname is i am covered by the blood i was hell-bound hell calling out to me but now christ jesus his call has made me free now nothing's the same for since jesus came i have got my new name thank god god gave that person a new life a new name praise god and blessed be the holy name of the living god we give him praise we give him honor and we give him glory amen i give him praise my friends and i give him honor and i give him all the glory amen oh glory to god hallelujah i know when my mother was finished cooking we may be playing in the yard and she will come to the doorway or to the kitchen window and call out our names come on home children it's supper time time for us to sit down and eat together my friends i think i can hear my father calling now at the setting of the sun come home come home at supper time hallelujah it's separate time once again and the holy spirit is calling out to his children he is calling out to you amen he's calling out to me can't you hear the blessed savior calling you calling you calling you can't you hear the blessed savior calling you the seals are now opened hallelujah the great shepherd is now calling his sheep listen to the words of the great sermon of god brother branham it's wrong called time in heaven if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come thou shall call and i will answer thou wilt have a desire to the work of thy hands oh the great shepherd is calling his sheep by their names the creative voice of god is calling them forth from the dust or changing their atoms even though they have not fallen asleep it is the rapture it is the great marriage supper supper of the lamb hallelujah oh praise god my friends it's supper time it's rapture time it's god calling his children back to himself back to the word back to a new life back to who they really are to come out of satan's prison house come out of satan's bondage and walk into freedom with jesus christ my sheep hear my voice and a stranger they will not follow i had joy with you before the foundation of the world oh praise god hallelujah amen one sat alone [Music] beside the highway begging his eyes were blind the white light he could not see then then jesus came and then he called him then jesus came and he set the captive free when jesus comes the tempter's power is broken may the tempter's power be broken right now satan in the name of jesus christ release every one of your victims under the divine sound of my voice to the glory of god hallelujah set them free now come out from them come out from amongst them and loose them in the name of jesus christ i know i'm a man you have no fear from me as a human but the christ who died on calvary and shed his blood for us and covers us and cleanses us and washes us by his blood by his blood he looses us and sets us free right now in the name of jesus christ except god's salvation accept god's healing accept god's deliverance if you could not walk stand and walk amen amen rise up from that sick bed in the name of jesus christ wherever you are place your faith in him stand upon the word of god and receive it he calls your name answer his call answer him and said lord here i am come come lord come into my heart i'm coming home lord i'm answering your call and i give my life to you and i walk a new way with you and i want to tell others of what you have done for me god tell my disciples tell them what the lord has done in your life in your heart that changes god has brought about and is bringing about for he knows your name hallelujah when he calls me i will answer i'll be somewhere listening for my name the rapture may come any moment any moment their night but when he calls me i will answer for i'll be somewhere listening for not my name good sunday morning god bless you my brothers and sisters in christ i trust
