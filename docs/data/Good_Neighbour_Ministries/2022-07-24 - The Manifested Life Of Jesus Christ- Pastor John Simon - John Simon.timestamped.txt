[36:44] have to turn on the mic right
[36:47] amen that makes a big difference when
[36:50] that's turned on just the same with us
[36:53] as believers we can believe but until
[36:55] the holy spirit quickens everything
[36:58] uh you know you just just another
[37:01] christian just another believer but when
[37:03] the holy spirit
[37:05] hits that when the fiery hits the
[37:08] combustion chamber of the heart and the
[37:11] spirit of god begins to move within that
[37:14] believer then he gives you motivation
[37:17] power amen it drives you you're not your
[37:21] own no more you belong to him praise god
[37:24] so we are driven and moved by the holy
[37:28] spirit but unless i get to talk in that
[37:31] way i might as well be preaching hey
[37:34] praise the lord we thank god for his
[37:37] goodness and for his grace and we will
[37:39] look into john chapter 14 verses 19 to
[37:44] 20
[37:45] just two verses
[37:47] and i'm just going to talk with you
[37:49] and praise god we trust that you let the
[37:53] simplicity
[37:54] of the message
[37:56] reach your heart and life
[38:01] hallelujah
[38:03] chapter 14
[38:07] says
[38:08] yet
[38:10] a little while
[38:12] and the world seat me no more
[38:16] but ye
[38:17] shall see me isn't that wonderful
[38:20] when the world can't see him yet we are
[38:23] seeing him everywhere making himself
[38:26] manifest because i live
[38:30] you shall live also
[38:33] at that day
[38:36] you shall know
[38:38] that i
[38:39] am in the father
[38:42] and ye in me
[38:44] and i in you
[38:47] praise the lord we'd like to emphasize
[38:50] that verse here today and we'd like to
[38:53] talk about the manifested life of christ
[38:57] amen the manifested
[39:00] life of christ our gracious heavenly
[39:03] father
[39:05] once again we are here
[39:07] in your presence like ruth in the field
[39:11] we are waiting on your coming
[39:15] waiting on your coming not the rapture
[39:18] but here with us
[39:20] in this building
[39:22] while we are yet bringing the word we
[39:24] pray that you will walk with us like you
[39:27] did on the way to emmaus we're not we
[39:30] are headed home to
[39:32] the new jerusalem
[39:33] but we pray that as we walk towards it
[39:37] that you will walk with us talk with us
[39:40] oh god show us the things from the
[39:42] prophets and announce the entire
[39:45] scripture
[39:47] unfolding yourself day after day as we
[39:51] walk this road with you
[39:53] god bless us today we pray as we
[39:56] surrender ourselves to thee
[39:58] in jesus name amen praise the lord may
[40:01] the lord richly bless you please be
[40:04] seated
[40:06] amen
[40:08] now
[40:11] this really is about the life of christ
[40:14] manifesting through you
[40:18] but manifesting through you
[40:21] without human efforts
[40:23] human struggle
[40:26] and
[40:26] that sort of thing
[40:28] amen because there's still a belief
[40:32] and still um
[40:35] shadows of teachings
[40:37] that tell people
[40:40] that they have to
[40:42] they have to add these things on to
[40:45] their lives they got to work these
[40:47] things until it comes to a perfection
[40:51] in them
[40:52] and uh you see the brothers that were
[40:55] preaching that had only a partial
[40:59] revelation
[41:00] and they were saying what they knew
[41:03] but the word has unfolded more until
[41:07] this hour and this time
[41:11] and now we know
[41:13] that salvation
[41:15] is of the lord
[41:18] it's not of the will of man it's not of
[41:20] you it's not of me it's not of anybody
[41:23] but salvation is of the lord
[41:28] and it is not by
[41:30] works of even
[41:32] righteousness
[41:34] that you might have done
[41:37] it's not by any
[41:39] human
[41:40] instrumentality
[41:42] we have been redeemed by the blood of
[41:45] christ
[41:46] not our works
[41:48] not our
[41:50] works which is only our sense of
[41:52] gratitude to the lord for saving us
[41:56] amen you already saved that's why you're
[41:59] grateful that's why you produce the good
[42:01] words to show him that you appreciate
[42:04] heavenly father i appreciate you i adore
[42:07] you i magnify you i thank you lord
[42:10] because you have done this for me lord
[42:13] hallelujah that's the reason why we're
[42:16] here today in the house of the lord
[42:19] glory be to god amen thank god
[42:22] [Applause]
[42:25] and that life
[42:27] the manifested life of christ
[42:30] amen
[42:31] manifesting through you
[42:33] doesn't manifest
[42:35] uh
[42:36] with your help with your strength with
[42:40] your
[42:41] intelligence with your wisdom
[42:44] he is either there in you or he is not
[42:48] if
[42:49] he is there and i believe he is with the
[42:52] true believer
[42:53] then perfection already dwells within
[42:58] all wisdom dwells within
[43:01] all knowledge dwells within
[43:04] all of the
[43:06] all of the righteousness holiness
[43:08] everything that you need is already
[43:11] dwelling within
[43:14] you may not be able to manifest it fully
[43:18] but in the mind and wisdom of the paul
[43:22] when he said but you've got to work out
[43:25] your salvation
[43:27] with fear and trembling you may know
[43:30] you're saved but that's inside of you
[43:32] but how you gonna work it out so that
[43:33] people outside of you can see that
[43:36] you're really saved you're really born
[43:37] again christ is in you of a truth amen
[43:41] hallelujah so that's what we're talking
[43:44] about and when that life begins to
[43:47] manifest through you
[43:51] then you see you don't have to walk
[43:52] around and say oh i better hold my
[43:55] temper i wouldn't look like a christian
[43:58] if if i don't hold my temp in this
[44:00] situation uh when the boss talked to me
[44:03] if if i react in a certain way he's
[44:06] going to say i'm not a christian you
[44:07] don't even have to think anymore
[44:10] you don't even have to think anymore
[44:13] because you are living now a life
[44:16] as i've said of unconscious godliness
[44:22] it's not you but it's him
[44:25] living through you
[44:27] and him living through you
[44:30] is also your spiritual
[44:34] identification that you are truly sons
[44:37] and daughters of the living god not by
[44:40] your effort but by his identification
[44:44] listen the scripture said abel offered a
[44:48] better sacrifice
[44:50] a more excellent sacrifice
[44:53] god
[44:55] testifying
[44:57] of his gift
[44:59] amen of his sacrifice
[45:02] that it was the right sacrifice
[45:04] that it was his inspired sacrifice that
[45:09] it was revealed sacrifice
[45:11] and god testified to that son abel had
[45:15] to say nothing about it they don't have
[45:17] to walk around saying oh i'm i'm a
[45:20] believer of jehovah i'm a christian i'm
[45:23] a message believer i'm
[45:26] i am bride
[45:28] and maybe the person as i've said before
[45:30] maybe a bridesmaid but they're calling
[45:31] themselves bright but the fact is that
[45:35] god testifies of it of himself
[45:40] amen until it amazes you
[45:44] it begins to surprise you
[45:47] you are shocked by the supernatural
[45:49] reaction of the holy spirit working
[45:53] through your life
[45:55] amen
[45:56] and then you know you can take no praise
[45:59] you can take no glory
[46:02] because it wasn't you to begin with
[46:05] you see you see now true humility is not
[46:08] trying to put on something to make
[46:11] yourself look humble he that is in you
[46:13] is already overcome and he is already
[46:16] humble so he manifests himself through
[46:19] you in that way
[46:21] so you don't have to do anything you
[46:22] just got to live
[46:24] the life of christ
[46:27] let him live his life working through
[46:30] you for his glory and honor praise the
[46:33] name of the lord hallelujah you remember
[46:36] brother branham in christ the mystery of
[46:38] god revealed once said
[46:41] at that day
[46:42] they'll know that i am in the father the
[46:46] father in me i and you amen praise god
[46:49] and you and me praise the lord he said
[46:52] what day
[46:53] that day he said that day is this day
[46:57] hallelujah and i'm glad today to let you
[47:00] know that this is this day that we are
[47:03] in that these things are supposed to be
[47:06] taking place
[47:07] now
[47:09] we read all the crisis the mystery of
[47:11] god revealed page 44
[47:14] so therefore
[47:16] there is no school
[47:18] that can teach you the light he doesn't
[47:21] say
[47:21] the life of christ he says no school can
[47:23] teach you but the fact is no school can
[47:27] teach you how to live the life of christ
[47:31] you understand what i'm saying i want
[47:32] this to be so clear when you walk out
[47:34] here why the prophet preaches and
[47:38] prophesies against theologians
[47:40] denominations bible schools systems
[47:44] everything else is because it is he
[47:48] himself that has has to be in you living
[47:52] out his own life
[47:55] for it to be the original life
[47:59] it has to be him he himself
[48:03] hallelujah for it to be the authentic
[48:06] life
[48:07] not one that you've been trained
[48:11] as a hypocrite as the brother branson
[48:13] hypocrite means actor yeah how to act
[48:17] like a christian
[48:19] your dress is supposed to be this length
[48:22] your your pants supposed to be this way
[48:24] all these outward things which we should
[48:27] pay attention to because you don't have
[48:29] to think the holy spirit will tell you
[48:32] what is modesty and how to walk and how
[48:34] to live but the fact is they emphasize
[48:38] all kinds of bible studies to teach you
[48:42] how to be a christian
[48:44] is that right
[48:46] now
[48:47] to teach you how to talk like a
[48:49] christian how to walk like a christian
[48:52] how to dress like a christian how to act
[48:55] like one but we are finding out now as
[48:58] he is blowing away these chaff from
[49:01] before us that that was not it that's a
[49:05] denominational conceptions that have
[49:07] come down to us through the ages but is
[49:10] his life being lived through us by
[49:14] himself that is the word
[49:18] being made flesh again
[49:22] that is the son of man
[49:25] now being revealed
[49:28] in human tents
[49:31] just bones covered with a a skin a tent
[49:36] of
[49:37] made of skin tabernacle covered by skin
[49:41] and god living within the individual
[49:44] and making himself manifest
[49:48] praise the lord
[49:50] that is what i'm talking about here
[49:52] today
[49:53] he said so therefore you see
[49:56] there is no school
[49:59] teach you the life of christ
[50:02] there is no theologian
[50:04] can do that
[50:06] no teaching that any man can bring that
[50:09] can teach you how to be a christian
[50:12] is that right he's teaching you only how
[50:15] to be an imitation of christ
[50:19] he's teaching you how to be a
[50:20] counterfeit a faker
[50:24] of christ or even though you're doing
[50:26] that unconsciously because some people
[50:29] live become christians out of a good
[50:31] intention amen but it's just like what's
[50:34] happening in russia now they told them
[50:36] they were communists and the first
[50:38] couple of generations they had to force
[50:40] them into it after that the new
[50:42] generation just walk in it and take it
[50:44] for granted that that they are
[50:46] communists
[50:47] you see and that's the way they think
[50:49] about it and it's the same lie satan
[50:52] spreads it and then after a while people
[50:55] just accept what all these teachings and
[50:58] scores of uh
[51:00] what should i say uh smoke
[51:03] you know he chose a lot of smoke
[51:05] uh bombs and cause people not to see
[51:08] clearly out of the world what it's
[51:12] really all about
[51:14] it's not about us
[51:16] it's all about him
[51:18] amen it's not how beautiful the church
[51:21] not how wonderful the singing though we
[51:23] need that it's none of those things it's
[51:26] all about him
[51:27] in his beauty in his power and his
[51:30] strength glory god hallelujah is him
[51:34] being revealed
[51:36] that's the whole story christ is the
[51:39] mystery
[51:41] of god being revealed
[51:43] hallelujah
[51:45] when you stop to think of it
[51:48] all these bible schools and uh have
[51:51] probed
[51:52] satan lucifer has probed at the bible
[51:57] the written word
[51:58] because the written word was god in a
[52:02] mystery and he was probing at that to
[52:05] find out what was under there not
[52:08] knowing god already has the principle
[52:11] upon this rock i'll build my church
[52:16] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[52:18] against it oh praise god the church is
[52:21] built on inspiration
[52:24] hallelujah and now
[52:27] inspiration is given by grace
[52:30] i mean revelation is given by grace
[52:33] hallelujah the prophet himself said you
[52:36] can't dream it you can't go
[52:38] and discern yourself for discernment you
[52:41] you don't give yourself a real genuine
[52:44] vision like that god by grace has to
[52:48] give that to you
[52:50] and by that he identifies his elect
[52:53] by that he identifies his sons and his
[52:56] daughters
[52:57] his real genes and germs
[53:00] he identifies them by the word
[53:03] so satan all through the centuries been
[53:06] probing probing probing and he has
[53:10] inclinations that are very close but he
[53:13] can never get to the exact truth until
[53:17] this day when the bible declares that
[53:20] this will the mysteries of god would be
[53:23] made revealed in this hour hallelujah by
[53:27] a seven angel that would come down
[53:30] praise god now you understand that
[53:33] sharon angel brother branham was just a
[53:36] physical person standing there but like
[53:39] we said last week the seventh angel
[53:42] the one with the swept back wings that
[53:45] was leading all the rest of them
[53:47] hallelujah that was really the mighty
[53:50] angel of revelation 10 1
[53:53] and the angel of revelation 10 1 came
[53:57] down to the revelation 10 7
[54:01] and manifested himself through the
[54:03] prophetic ministry of our brother
[54:05] million million brethren
[54:08] because remember god always manifests
[54:10] through prophets
[54:12] and then prophets in the old testament
[54:14] prophets through the old testament and
[54:16] then he came on the scene emmanuel god
[54:20] with us
[54:22] and then he was not another
[54:25] great prophet of god as the muhammadans
[54:27] will say
[54:28] another great prophet but he was god
[54:31] come to be his own prophet
[54:35] amen
[54:36] god come to be his own prophet
[54:39] and now the cycle of truth goes on
[54:42] and we come back when he is no more in a
[54:45] one man one member body but now the
[54:49] corner wheat fell on the ground come up
[54:52] and it has multiplied itself
[54:54] and comes back on the scene as a as a
[54:58] many member body that we call the bride
[55:03] born from his side
[55:05] bonus part of him
[55:07] hallelujah for she is him
[55:10] being revealed in this last day
[55:13] christ in you and me making himself
[55:16] manifest hallelujah praise god let me
[55:19] just calm down here this is this making
[55:22] sense to you
[55:23] praise the lord
[55:27] hallelujah
[55:29] so you see no school
[55:32] no theologian
[55:34] no teachings in the bible
[55:36] done by any school
[55:39] that knows anything about it they cannot
[55:43] know anything about this for god has hid
[55:47] the senses of knowing that knowing it
[55:51] from the very even their elected
[55:53] teachers and everything else they cannot
[55:57] know it
[55:58] it's because
[56:00] it's a personal affair
[56:03] with the and christ
[56:06] himself is revealed to them hallelujah
[56:09] there is no
[56:11] no
[56:12] church group that that will catch the
[56:14] revelation all at the same time because
[56:17] it's an individual affair
[56:20] between you and god that's why we say me
[56:23] and jesus we got a good thing going
[56:26] me and jesus we got it all worked out
[56:28] hallelujah because it's you and him
[56:32] hallelujah praise be to god hallelujah
[56:35] amen see that's the way it is see and
[56:39] then if you say
[56:42] he has been revealed to you
[56:45] and that life
[56:47] christ
[56:48] produced here that was produced here in
[56:51] the bible
[56:52] if that same life that was in him
[56:55] does not produce itself in you now then
[56:59] you got the wrong revelation
[57:02] what is the identification
[57:05] not of what you are saying
[57:07] not of what anybody is saying about you
[57:10] you can tell mother teresa she's a saint
[57:13] you can tell this one that they are
[57:15] they're an apostle you can tell the
[57:17] other one he's this he is that but until
[57:19] god himself let that life project
[57:22] through you without your human effort
[57:25] you are just moving on receiving those
[57:28] things in vain praise the name of the
[57:31] lord hallelujah the life has got to be
[57:35] produced and projecting within your
[57:38] heart and life hallelujah amen and the
[57:41] reason why real christianity like it was
[57:45] in the book of acts
[57:47] has not been produced through all these
[57:50] seven church ages except for a few for
[57:53] god never left himself without a witness
[57:57] in every age you had some that were real
[58:00] genuine the holy ghost flow through them
[58:03] in every possible way but the fact is
[58:07] listen that this life was never been
[58:09] produced because the people have had
[58:12] wrong revelation through the ages
[58:16] and wrong revelation can't bring you the
[58:18] divine projection of the holy spirit
[58:21] amen it's the right word of god made
[58:25] known to you when you you eat the book
[58:28] and you project what life is in you by
[58:31] the holy spirit of god working within
[58:34] your life praise god it's out of your
[58:36] hands i say
[58:38] i said no
[58:39] christianity is really out of your hands
[58:42] amen oh i studied for for every night i
[58:47] studied until they break i i dedicate
[58:50] myself for five years ten years i went
[58:52] in the wilderness i did this i did that
[58:55] that's all good that's wonderful but
[58:57] that's not what did it it's he himself
[59:00] got to come and come to your life and
[59:02] begin to expand
[59:04] his wisdom his understanding to you and
[59:06] unveil himself to you and then you'll
[59:09] live in you and manifest himself through
[59:12] you amen lord of god hallelujah amen oh
[59:17] my praise god see the genuine life of
[59:20] christ could not
[59:22] reproduce itself
[59:24] and could not project through the people
[59:27] because it's being it was being water
[59:30] watered by the wrong teaching
[59:34] and being watered by wrong teachings
[59:38] that germ life could not come into
[59:42] germination and manifestation within the
[59:45] hearts of the people
[59:47] yet they could call themselves a
[59:49] christian like a woman with a stillborn
[59:51] born child saying she has a baby she
[59:53] does have a baby but it's a stillborn
[59:55] one amen but when the one of the holy
[59:58] spirit strikes the soul and that life
[1:00:01] comes forth makes itself manifest with a
[1:00:04] scream hallelujah born again free from
[1:00:08] sin i'm happy night and day oh praise
[1:00:11] god
[1:00:12] forevermore oh there's no more doubt
[1:00:15] amen because you're walking in him you
[1:00:18] are certain of god
[1:00:21] amen praise the lord oh praise god they
[1:00:25] go around this this is that it's the
[1:00:27] other if you if you if you fall in the
[1:00:29] ground if you speak in towns is you got
[1:00:32] it if you did this you got it if you
[1:00:34] walk under a certain church flag you got
[1:00:36] it if you shake the elder's hand you got
[1:00:38] it if you do this you do that they're
[1:00:41] all guessing at what it is that's just
[1:00:43] satan
[1:00:44] through his religious uh enticing
[1:00:47] spirits amen not the people now now the
[1:00:51] people don't know that he's manipulating
[1:00:54] and using whatever assets he has on the
[1:00:57] earth but he is doing that to cast smoke
[1:01:01] screens that people can't see what the
[1:01:04] truth is because he himself doesn't know
[1:01:06] the truth
[1:01:08] amen because it's been healed hallelujah
[1:01:11] and that's why that manifested life
[1:01:14] could not produce be produced hallelujah
[1:01:18] and then you'll see real manifested sons
[1:01:21] and daughters of god
[1:01:23] amen praise god listen here he says page
[1:01:27] 45 i think of christ the mystery
[1:01:30] do you know
[1:01:31] god is known by simplicity
[1:01:37] hallelujah
[1:01:39] and when god manifests himself it's
[1:01:41] going to be so simple
[1:01:43] and it can't be that
[1:01:46] that man
[1:01:47] that woman has to walk around with the
[1:01:50] air of holiness
[1:01:53] that preacher
[1:01:56] act in such a way he doesn't have any
[1:01:58] real gr as you call it
[1:02:01] princely
[1:02:03] religious graces
[1:02:05] as the catholics would say a prince of
[1:02:07] the holy church and you got you
[1:02:10] or any of these denominations they got
[1:02:12] that same
[1:02:13] daughter-like attitude they don't
[1:02:16] realize it doesn't work like that god
[1:02:18] goes the total opposite where the wind
[1:02:20] blowing where it lists that no man knows
[1:02:22] where it goes don't know what's going to
[1:02:23] be said next then what's going to be
[1:02:25] done next you can't be anticipated
[1:02:27] because you are not bound in a system
[1:02:31] and that system satan knows it better
[1:02:33] than you
[1:02:35] hallelujah but you're out of the system
[1:02:38] even in natural things
[1:02:40] if i might illustrate
[1:02:42] do you know you got the internet now and
[1:02:44] all this thing going out do you know
[1:02:46] that if you don't put your credit cards
[1:02:50] you don't put this put that on the
[1:02:52] internet and you come off of it
[1:02:54] completely do you know they're literally
[1:02:57] they're saying it but you literally shut
[1:02:59] out
[1:03:01] you won't have access
[1:03:02] to the rest of the internet somebody
[1:03:05] that has connections will have to do it
[1:03:07] but you can't
[1:03:08] you can't even get your own money out
[1:03:10] the bank if you're not connected to the
[1:03:12] internet so i'm just saying satan is
[1:03:16] setting that natural one up that's going
[1:03:18] on now on the earth at the same time
[1:03:20] spiritually he's doing the same thing
[1:03:24] but god is known
[1:03:26] by simplicity hallelujah you see uh when
[1:03:31] brother brother
[1:03:32] or the holy spirit used brother branham
[1:03:34] because we know that brother branham
[1:03:36] broke the seals the lamb broke the seals
[1:03:40] so the lamb had to be there with him to
[1:03:43] break those seals and we explain to you
[1:03:46] about the covenant angel coming and
[1:03:48] moving through him and the spirit
[1:03:51] speaking through the prophet making
[1:03:53] known the word of god to the people amen
[1:03:56] hallelujah and so when the seals were
[1:04:00] given all of them were great and
[1:04:02] manifest but when you come to the
[1:04:03] seventh you couldn't see nothing it
[1:04:06] don't seem to be nothing what did he
[1:04:07] really say he just said the seventh seal
[1:04:10] and you know because the seventh seal
[1:04:12] wasn't writing on a page the seventh
[1:04:14] seal was
[1:04:15] is a person
[1:04:17] the seventh seal was christ
[1:04:19] revealing himself
[1:04:21] not therefore uh before he used to be
[1:04:24] preaching uh
[1:04:25] preaching there and saying second coming
[1:04:27] of chronic say amen hallelujah he would
[1:04:30] preach about who do you use all this
[1:04:32] type of thing but then from the day he
[1:04:35] preached the seventh seal who do you see
[1:04:38] this is
[1:04:40] who do you say this is
[1:04:43] who do you say the son of man am
[1:04:46] then he'd be preaching a greater than
[1:04:48] solomon is here
[1:04:49] praise god hallelujah what was he doing
[1:04:52] letting you know that the jesus christ
[1:04:55] who was in word form is now back here
[1:04:59] now in spirit form hallelujah and he is
[1:05:02] now manifesting himself to his people
[1:05:05] amen
[1:05:06] god working through his own people
[1:05:09] making himself known so a lot of people
[1:05:11] came out a lot of people that would
[1:05:13] follow brother branham's ministry began
[1:05:15] to say i don't see i don't see nothing
[1:05:18] outstanding about that i don't see
[1:05:20] nothing miraculous about that hallelujah
[1:05:24] i didn't see nothing at all exciting and
[1:05:26] thrilling but while
[1:05:28] they were saying that there were other
[1:05:32] people there that were sitting trilled
[1:05:34] to the bone with hot troubling
[1:05:37] excitement waiting for the rest of the
[1:05:40] word of god to come forth they couldn't
[1:05:42] stand it because god was revealing
[1:05:45] himself and making himself known by the
[1:05:48] opening of the world praise god
[1:05:50] hallelujah amen oh praise god listen
[1:05:55] god is known by simplicity
[1:06:00] of the revelation of jesus christ in
[1:06:04] the most illiterate person
[1:06:08] god is known
[1:06:10] by simplicity
[1:06:12] of jesus of the revelation of jesus
[1:06:15] christ in the most literate person you
[1:06:18] see it's when that revelation get in the
[1:06:21] most illiterate person they don't have
[1:06:23] to have wisdom of their own they don't
[1:06:25] have to know anything they don't have to
[1:06:27] this or that because it's him doing it
[1:06:30] through that illiterate person it's him
[1:06:32] revealing himself to the person
[1:06:35] regardless of the condition hallelujah
[1:06:38] amen you see we're moving away from
[1:06:42] that uh babylonian teaching that they've
[1:06:44] been given the people
[1:06:46] until it's entrenched in
[1:06:49] everyday religion
[1:06:51] telling the people
[1:06:52] that oh you you've got to work
[1:06:56] work for the lord you've got to
[1:06:58] sacrifice you you've got to do this no
[1:07:01] he said i died that you might live
[1:07:04] so oh
[1:07:06] the poverty of of our lord
[1:07:09] don't set your eyes on on riches
[1:07:13] give the church your riches
[1:07:16] you see that
[1:07:18] see they got your eyes off the word
[1:07:20] and they tell you you suffer for the
[1:07:22] lord he but he said i already suffered
[1:07:24] you don't have to suffer he said oh
[1:07:28] you know
[1:07:29] our poverty
[1:07:31] proves that we are really living for the
[1:07:33] lord he said i became already poor
[1:07:37] that you might be rich
[1:07:39] i know a lot of christians don't believe
[1:07:41] in getting rich
[1:07:43] but he just said it
[1:07:46] i became poor that you might be rich
[1:07:50] hallelujah
[1:07:52] oh that means spiritual things
[1:07:54] no it doesn't mean spiritual things
[1:07:56] alone that's part of it because when
[1:07:58] peter doesn't say master what shall we
[1:08:01] have for following you
[1:08:03] he didn't say come on be more spiritual
[1:08:06] than that peter the
[1:08:08] you i i'm fixing to give you the key of
[1:08:11] the kingdom and you're asking me about
[1:08:13] carnal things and he turned no jesus
[1:08:16] turned and said for following me you
[1:08:19] shall have houses
[1:08:22] you hear that not one house
[1:08:24] you shall have houses
[1:08:27] and you shall have lands
[1:08:30] and you want them to understand that he
[1:08:32] was not talking spiritually only
[1:08:36] he said in this world now
[1:08:39] and also in the world to come
[1:08:43] [Applause]
[1:08:48] i got kind of sidetracked there
[1:08:52] praise god
[1:08:54] years ago the holy spirit broke me into
[1:08:57] brother branham couldn't preach on those
[1:08:59] things
[1:09:00] but he left them in the word and so i
[1:09:03] preached a series on that and i've never
[1:09:05] really preached it again but the fact is
[1:09:09] god wants you to prosper
[1:09:13] is that right
[1:09:14] god wants you to be healthy
[1:09:17] god wants you to be
[1:09:18] happy god wants you to have joy
[1:09:22] walking with him following him serving
[1:09:25] him with joy
[1:09:27] amen
[1:09:29] for my yoke is what easy
[1:09:32] and my burden is light
[1:09:34] but they were telling you no it's not
[1:09:37] easy sorrow for the lord you know
[1:09:39] on easter you're supposed to take wires
[1:09:42] and uh barbed wire and flagellate your
[1:09:45] body to show how sorry you are for the
[1:09:48] sins what he said i've done it all
[1:09:50] already you don't need to do it again
[1:09:54] is that right
[1:09:55] you are justified
[1:09:58] the judge can't put you in jail because
[1:10:01] i am taking i took the whole sentence
[1:10:05] that you supposed to serve i serve the
[1:10:07] sentence
[1:10:10] so you can't be sentenced again you're
[1:10:12] free
[1:10:14] you've been set free by the grace of
[1:10:16] almighty god hallelujah
[1:10:19] amen
[1:10:20] what are you fighting up yourself
[1:10:22] threatening and fussing and everything
[1:10:24] else to live the life of christ let him
[1:10:27] manifest himself and his life through
[1:10:30] you amen oh praise god hallelujah amen
[1:10:34] so you see
[1:10:38] it is by the
[1:10:39] simplicity of the revelation of jesus
[1:10:42] christ even in the most illiterate
[1:10:45] person
[1:10:47] praise god
[1:10:48] so even if you are most highly
[1:10:51] intelligent person it still is not you
[1:10:54] that's why paul realized that and he
[1:10:56] said not that he threw away his wisdom
[1:11:00] he can't get rid of that because he
[1:11:01] already know what he know what he knows
[1:11:03] but but he said i count it
[1:11:05] down and ash
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:08] hallelujah to gain the wisdom of jesus
[1:11:11] christ
[1:11:13] hallelujah praise god amen so that's the
[1:11:16] importance he said therefore you see
[1:11:20] it is not your theology
[1:11:23] it is a revelation of jesus christ for
[1:11:25] he said upon this rock i'll build my
[1:11:28] church
[1:11:29] no other rock is accepted here
[1:11:33] upon this rock amen nothing else
[1:11:38] no school no nothing
[1:11:41] but egg but on exactly the revelation of
[1:11:45] jesus christ himself
[1:11:47] in a new birth
[1:11:50] because it's him in you is in your birth
[1:11:54] you are born in him
[1:11:56] and he is born in you again
[1:12:00] not in mary back there but in you again
[1:12:05] the word of god made flesh again
[1:12:09] in the true believer not in born
[1:12:12] virgin-born flesh
[1:12:15] but in redeemed flesh
[1:12:18] purified and justified by the blood of
[1:12:21] jesus christ
[1:12:23] hallelujah o praise god amen
[1:12:27] oh praise god
[1:12:30] he is not this is not built on any roman
[1:12:34] rock it's not built on any
[1:12:38] protestant rock
[1:12:40] no other school no nothing it's not
[1:12:44] built on that it's him
[1:12:46] when he is born in there and injects his
[1:12:51] own life
[1:12:53] amen and your life then is gone and the
[1:12:58] life of christ
[1:12:59] is projecting itself through you
[1:13:03] with the preeminence to the people in
[1:13:05] other words his life in you now begins
[1:13:08] to take preeminence
[1:13:11] over all your desires all your actions
[1:13:14] what you used to do before all of a
[1:13:16] sudden you start changing my god's power
[1:13:18] to transform hallelujah it's not you
[1:13:21] transforming yourself but god's power
[1:13:24] him in you begins to transform you
[1:13:26] hallelujah amen brother brenham said one
[1:13:30] time he said you know when i was a boy i
[1:13:31] wanted to be a soldier amen but god
[1:13:34] called me praise god you understand that
[1:13:37] when we were child we think as a child
[1:13:39] we want to do this we want to do it but
[1:13:41] when the holy spirit takes over and
[1:13:43] begins to take the preeminence the
[1:13:46] leadership the control over your life he
[1:13:49] begins to take away a certain taste he
[1:13:52] took away certain friends from you he
[1:13:54] take away certain things that you used
[1:13:56] to love from you it's not you
[1:14:00] i gotta do away with this if i want to
[1:14:02] be a real christian i gotta get rid of
[1:14:03] that it's not you doing this doing that
[1:14:06] get rid of this or that it's him and you
[1:14:08] beginning to move across your heart
[1:14:11] across your leg change your taste
[1:14:13] amen
[1:14:16] oh praise god
[1:14:18] oh yes he is born in there and injects
[1:14:22] his own life
[1:14:24] through you with the preeminences to the
[1:14:27] rest of the people seeing that change
[1:14:30] and there begin to see
[1:14:32] that very life
[1:14:35] hallelujah doing the same thing through
[1:14:37] you
[1:14:38] and outside of that
[1:14:40] the rest of it
[1:14:43] is not even called
[1:14:45] at all
[1:14:46] in other words they're not even elected
[1:14:49] the rest that don't get that come in
[1:14:51] them
[1:14:52] not even elected it's not even called he
[1:14:54] said at all praise the name of the lord
[1:14:57] how wonderful to know that that he's
[1:14:59] identifying the individual by projecting
[1:15:03] himself hallelujah amen glory be to god
[1:15:07] amen how when the life of christ comes
[1:15:11] forth it it's such a simple form
[1:15:14] that uh
[1:15:16] it's not funny
[1:15:17] because
[1:15:19] this is christianity where i'm free
[1:15:24] i'm not boned
[1:15:26] i i'm not bummed by mans and humans
[1:15:29] ideas
[1:15:30] but yet my life is being conducted
[1:15:34] by the word having preeminence over me
[1:15:38] but yet i'm not feeling like i'm tied up
[1:15:40] i'm bound up
[1:15:42] i can't do this i can't do that i can't
[1:15:44] go here i can't do go there i can't do
[1:15:46] the other whatever i'm free
[1:15:49] but the holy spirit keeps you within the
[1:15:53] boundaries of the world
[1:15:56] not by throwing a lasso or chaining you
[1:15:59] to a post
[1:16:01] like a johnny crow no
[1:16:03] but you are free any race thoroughbred
[1:16:07] knows that it can run out like all the
[1:16:09] other horses it can run out and jump on
[1:16:11] the fields run up the mountain run up
[1:16:13] the hill but they're not going to win no
[1:16:15] prices they don't stay on the racetrack
[1:16:18] is that right
[1:16:19] you got to stay on the racetrack and we
[1:16:21] got to stay between the white lines of
[1:16:23] the world we've got to walk with the
[1:16:26] word hallelujah and the word walks with
[1:16:28] us in us
[1:16:30] and leads us into a perfect light for
[1:16:32] the glory of god hallelujah amen thank
[1:16:36] god forevermore oh glory be to god
[1:16:40] now
[1:16:42] today he wants to get somebody
[1:16:46] that can begin to see that what i'm
[1:16:49] telling you here and teaching here
[1:16:52] back then brother branham was saying
[1:16:54] oh he's here trying to get somebody to
[1:16:58] see that
[1:17:00] do you see that
[1:17:01] do you see that
[1:17:03] do you recognize what i'm talking about
[1:17:05] here
[1:17:06] oh praise god then the prophet's
[1:17:09] prophecy is now being fulfilled at this
[1:17:12] hour with you you people i don't mean in
[1:17:15] this church alone it's been fulfilled
[1:17:17] around the world with anybody else and
[1:17:19] any preacher any church that would
[1:17:22] receive the fullness of the revelation
[1:17:24] or the word of god but i'm speaking here
[1:17:27] locally now that's why i said it that
[1:17:30] way amen that you see that that's him
[1:17:34] working out
[1:17:36] his own will amen you see
[1:17:39] that they can lift the world
[1:17:42] jesus
[1:17:44] uh seeing it
[1:17:47] that it could be perfectly born
[1:17:50] for this day
[1:17:51] hallelujah amen praise god born again
[1:17:55] for this day and i'm so glad that we can
[1:17:58] have that new birth for this day
[1:18:00] not mary carrying the word
[1:18:04] but the bride
[1:18:05] the elected
[1:18:07] members of the body of the bride
[1:18:09] carrying the world
[1:18:12] bearing the reproach for carrying the
[1:18:14] world
[1:18:16] not being ashamed of him
[1:18:18] for carrying the word
[1:18:20] because they're carrying the word
[1:18:23] hallelujah and we know the word that we
[1:18:26] received is not of man
[1:18:29] it's not of william branham it's not of
[1:18:32] any man
[1:18:33] it is of god but god had to use a man to
[1:18:36] manifest his word and to make it plain
[1:18:40] praise god hallelujah so the
[1:18:43] word we have received is from god
[1:18:45] himself
[1:18:47] for the spoken word is the original seed
[1:18:51] and that's what we have received from
[1:18:53] the living god that pregnants the soul
[1:18:55] and brings forth the life of christ made
[1:18:58] manifest and elected for the hour and
[1:19:00] for the day thank god amen yes sir

[1:19:20] and is the bride today
[1:19:22] god's revelation

[1:19:31] revealed again
[1:19:34] in flesh
[1:19:36] it's the son of man
[1:19:38] being revealed
[1:19:40] through you and me
[1:19:42] and we are moved by the holy spirit
[1:19:46] god is moving his men and women on his
[1:19:48] chest board
[1:19:49] and the devil don't know what autumn
[1:19:52] move he's going to make
[1:19:54] until he plays the last trump and the
[1:19:57] whole thing goes up and he pulls in the
[1:19:59] whole pot glory to god hallelujah i just
[1:20:02] put it that way but my god that's what's
[1:20:06] going on and we are caught up in the
[1:20:07] middle of all this
[1:20:10] we are caught up in the middle of all
[1:20:11] this and we thank god for his grace amen
[1:20:15] hallelujah now
[1:20:17] think of it
[1:20:18] amen he sanctifies with his spirit
[1:20:22] and uh true and by the blood a church
[1:20:26] that he might make every promise
[1:20:30] in this last day be revealed
[1:20:33] hallelujah the promises that are left in
[1:20:36] the world it's becoming unto us to
[1:20:38] fulfill all righteousness is supposed to
[1:20:40] be fulfilled through the bride
[1:20:44] jesus fulfilled all the prophecies 400
[1:20:48] and whatever at that time grew his life
[1:20:51] there and now it's a bride's time for
[1:20:54] she is part of him and she's to fulfill
[1:20:56] the rest of the world
[1:20:59] by her works but by his works
[1:21:03] the continuing ministry of jesus christ
[1:21:05] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:21:08] hallelujah through the bride of jesus
[1:21:11] christ amen
[1:21:13] oh praise god remember
[1:21:16] for the church is the blood of christ

[1:21:22] because the life is always in the blood
[1:21:26] you get that oh the life is always in
[1:21:30] the blood
[1:21:31] and he sends the germ life
[1:21:33] into the elected
[1:21:35] on that life being elected he is saying
[1:21:38] it now here the church is the blood of
[1:21:42] christ
[1:21:43] the carrier
[1:21:45] for the life
[1:21:46] is the blood
[1:21:48] you never no doctor sees that life but
[1:21:51] he sees the red chemistry of the blood
[1:21:54] but the life is in the blood even though
[1:21:56] he's not seeing it and that's what that
[1:21:58] what he is saying to you here now that
[1:22:00] the real church is the blood of christ
[1:22:04] the carrier of his life
[1:22:07] amen praise god forevermore hallelujah
[1:22:11] and that's the baptism of the holy
[1:22:15] spirit into his body see for he
[1:22:19] recognized only his flesh his own body
[1:22:24] in other words he he recognizes only
[1:22:28] those
[1:22:30] elected
[1:22:31] beings or bodies
[1:22:33] that he already prepare for a body has
[1:22:36] now prepared me
[1:22:38] before the foundations
[1:22:40] so he knows where he is coming to in
[1:22:43] this particular age
[1:22:45] in every other age he knew where he had
[1:22:47] to come to
[1:22:49] and a body that's prepared to him he
[1:22:52] knows exactly he's coming to that body
[1:22:54] and he recognizes only that
[1:22:57] those ones he recognizes
[1:23:00] the other ones may look the same like
[1:23:02] the woman's pattern same clot same
[1:23:05] everything but he recognizes this part
[1:23:07] and not that part
[1:23:09] amen because that is of his own choosing
[1:23:14] see
[1:23:14] the holy spirit the living god
[1:23:17] hallelujah that's what we're a part of
[1:23:21] amen we're a part of his spirit
[1:23:24] we are part of the pillar of fire
[1:23:27] we're part of this war
[1:23:30] we're a part of the
[1:23:32] husband for we are not made of another
[1:23:35] material separate from him we are made
[1:23:38] out of the same material
[1:23:41] if he is eternal you are eternal
[1:23:44] amen your flesh will die but the man
[1:23:47] inside that man is eternal and he lives
[1:23:50] on
[1:23:51] and on and on and last forever
[1:23:54] praise peter god hallelujah amen that's
[1:23:59] why god will come and claim you and
[1:24:02] baptize you with the holy spirit not
[1:24:04] because you get up like ahab's prophets
[1:24:07] and jump up and beat the drums and
[1:24:10] holler and scream and you're going to
[1:24:12] influence god you think god is somebody
[1:24:15] yet can be influenced to change his
[1:24:17] opinion god is mo god sits still
[1:24:22] and he moves
[1:24:24] but he is not moved
[1:24:27] by men and the actions and and their
[1:24:30] persuasions and things that they will do
[1:24:33] amen the great rock of our redemption
[1:24:37] jesus christ hallelujah amen yes sir o
[1:24:41] praise god amen
[1:24:44] so the gene of god
[1:24:46] is laying there i know i can end the
[1:24:48] service because the spirit of god has
[1:24:51] pushed out enough to you here but praise
[1:24:54] the lord i'm not done you don't mind
[1:25:03] hallelujah
[1:25:06] amen
[1:25:07] the gene of god
[1:25:10] may be laying within the heart and life
[1:25:12] but it will lay there dormant
[1:25:17] until it is
[1:25:18] recognized
[1:25:20] by the holy spirit
[1:25:23] claimed by the holy spirit
[1:25:27] called by the holy spirit
[1:25:29] amen
[1:25:30] oh praise god so his part is that he's
[1:25:34] playing right now but this holy spirit
[1:25:37] only recognizes
[1:25:39] those of his own body
[1:25:43] what i'm talking about is what brother
[1:25:45] branham spoke and he speaks it so simple
[1:25:47] and leaves it like that is about the
[1:25:50] eagle in this last day once more flying
[1:25:53] over the barnyard
[1:25:56] but the barnyard of this earth of this
[1:25:58] world with all this terrible stenches
[1:26:01] and sticks and all kinds of worms and
[1:26:04] everything else he is the great jehovah
[1:26:07] evil flying over the barnyard amen i'm
[1:26:11] looking and looking for his sons and his
[1:26:13] daughters hallelujah and then he lets
[1:26:16] the prophet let out to scream hallelujah
[1:26:19] amen and they don't know what it is but
[1:26:22] the deep calls to the deep and the deep

[1:26:51] dimensions of the spirit of christ amen

[1:27:05] of god hallelujah amen praise god
[1:27:08] hallelujah oh isn't that wonderful
[1:27:11] brother sister that we are like that
[1:27:14] looking around for his prepared bodies
[1:27:16] amen you know we've preached on that
[1:27:19] prepared ground the farmer don't just go
[1:27:22] and plant seed or
[1:27:24] pick fruit from ground heat and prepare
[1:27:27] the crumb has to be prepared
[1:27:29] prepared ground
[1:27:31] praise god he saws the seed on what
[1:27:34] prepared ground
[1:27:36] lord of god and the seed of god was sown
[1:27:38] within your hearts that was prepared
[1:27:42] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:45] and so
[1:27:46] when jesus spoke and said a body has now
[1:27:49] prepared me
[1:27:51] hallelujah now
[1:27:53] the spirit is moving over the world
[1:27:56] searching for those prepared bodies
[1:27:59] prepared people prepare ground that will
[1:28:02] receive this word amen
[1:28:05] and when the word strikes the soul that
[1:28:08] comes to life
[1:28:09] begins to come out of your spiritual
[1:28:11] amnesia
[1:28:13] before that used to think i am this i am
[1:28:15] that i'm going to be a fireman i'm going
[1:28:17] to be a soldier i'm going to be that i'm
[1:28:19] going to be the other but when the
[1:28:20] spirit strikes the soul the soul wakes
[1:28:23] up it begins to rise up praise god up to
[1:28:27] the sunlight up to the rain up to the
[1:28:30] word of god back to life walking in the
[1:28:32] power of the holy spirit amen
[1:28:35] all glory be to god forevermore i trust
[1:28:39] that wherever this goes wherever people
[1:28:42] are hearing what i'm saying here today
[1:28:44] won't take it as a partial thing or uh
[1:28:47] or saying something to glorify man or
[1:28:50] glorify a church or glorify anything but
[1:28:53] this is the glorified word glorify jesus
[1:28:56] christ
[1:28:59] even if one out there can recognize and
[1:29:02] say that's right
[1:29:04] i believe it i see it
[1:29:06] hallelujah
[1:29:08] amen praise god amen looking for his
[1:29:12] prepared bodies amen and recognizes that
[1:29:16] body baptizes anointed and that's what
[1:29:20] and he
[1:29:21] brings that body let them be aware
[1:29:24] that they are part of the bride body his
[1:29:28] body
[1:29:29] amen you're just a part of it whether a
[1:29:31] toe a finger a hand or whatever but he
[1:29:34] brings you into your position
[1:29:37] connects you to the bride body worldwide
[1:29:40] wherever it is
[1:29:42] not in any church i'm not saying the
[1:29:44] church
[1:29:45] message groups is the bride or is the
[1:29:47] body but the invisible body of christ
[1:29:52] that will know
[1:29:54] and recognize each other
[1:29:58] not based
[1:29:59] on
[1:30:00] any
[1:30:01] church doctrine
[1:30:03] but based on the revelation of the world
[1:30:08] that's why you meet a brother or sister
[1:30:10] said within five minutes
[1:30:13] you'll know
[1:30:15] it's not that you're going to scrutinize
[1:30:17] in search but you don't have to do that
[1:30:21] prophet said be simple
[1:30:23] be humble
[1:30:24] be reverent
[1:30:26] and god will bless you
[1:30:29] but the holy spirit will make you aware
[1:30:31] right praise the lord you talk to
[1:30:34] somebody all of a sudden
[1:30:35] something catches your attention
[1:30:38] makes you aware praise the lord somebody
[1:30:40] may think you're guessing but you're not
[1:30:42] guessing in that moment
[1:30:43] because you've seen something
[1:30:46] something's been shown to you and you
[1:30:48] recognize what is really happening amen
[1:30:52] listen
[1:30:54] see
[1:30:55] he recognizes his own body
[1:30:58] his own flesh
[1:31:00] his word it's a revelation
[1:31:04] and she the bride knows it
[1:31:08] hallelujah
[1:31:10] she knows it
[1:31:11] rebecca recognize her bridegroom that
[1:31:14] the bride recognizes the word
[1:31:16] she knows it
[1:31:18] hallelujah nobody didn't have to explain
[1:31:21] to her nothing she just the moment she
[1:31:24] sees him she knows him amen she'll
[1:31:26] recognize it right away because by the
[1:31:28] holy spirit of the living god amen oh my
[1:31:33] you see
[1:31:34] now
[1:31:35] he saw that if
[1:31:38] but eve
[1:31:39] knowed it but she still fell
[1:31:42] and but this one knows it and she will
[1:31:46] not fall
[1:31:48] thank god hallelujah she's ordained not
[1:31:52] to fall she would fall she's
[1:31:55] predestinated by god blessed is the man
[1:31:59] whom god will not impute sin
[1:32:03] you're blessed to have a germ of jesus
[1:32:05] see
[1:32:06] you're blessed to be an attribute of god
[1:32:09] he can't impute sin unto you hallelujah
[1:32:13] praise god because he set you free
[1:32:15] already he redeemed you already
[1:32:17] and if you're redeemed you've been
[1:32:18] washed by the blood of christ
[1:32:20] so somebody said but i see this i see
[1:32:22] that i know this about you i know that
[1:32:24] you can know whatever you like
[1:32:27] what you know doesn't mean nothing
[1:32:30] it's what the blood has done
[1:32:32] [Applause]
[1:32:34] [Music]
[1:32:35] [Applause]
[1:32:38] praise be to god hallelujah amen so the
[1:32:42] bride of this day is predestinated
[1:32:45] just as mary was
[1:32:47] hallelujah because elijah said you know
[1:32:50] isaiah said virgin shall conceive and
[1:32:53] bear a son the word and bear the word in
[1:32:58] flesh amen praise god it's the same
[1:33:02] thing happening again today in this hour
[1:33:05] but in such a simple way it's not
[1:33:08] gabriel coming down from heaven and
[1:33:11] saying as
[1:33:12] they portrayed that way i don't believe
[1:33:14] it that way but they portrayed gabriel
[1:33:17] saying oh
[1:33:18] i am gabriel sent from the presence of
[1:33:21] almighty god
[1:33:24] mary you are really blessed
[1:33:27] you will bear us up no
[1:33:30] i believe she met an ordinary man
[1:33:33] but his presence alone she knew it was
[1:33:35] the angel of god
[1:33:38] that brother branham said sometimes he
[1:33:40] would come and be sitting in a
[1:33:41] congregation
[1:33:43] dressed in a regular clothes like people
[1:33:46] but he's sitting right amongst the
[1:33:48] people he said but i can't tell you
[1:33:49] anything
[1:33:50] i can't say nothing he's sitting right
[1:33:52] in the church
[1:33:57] but i can't say nothing to you because
[1:33:59] he's looking at me i'm looking at him
[1:34:01] and i'm preaching
[1:34:03] what a condition to be in
[1:34:06] praise the lord it's like sitting you
[1:34:09] know what it was like when you sat there
[1:34:11] and the school master is sitting right
[1:34:13] there watching at you and then you have
[1:34:15] to go on the board and do something
[1:34:18] man right
[1:34:20] the angel of god sit right there in the
[1:34:22] church and he's preaching the word
[1:34:24] praise god so it's that same kind of
[1:34:26] thing
[1:34:28] but you see
[1:34:31] mary was predestinated of god i i want
[1:34:34] to say this way so you can get it clear
[1:34:37] she was predestined of god as the
[1:34:40] one that will produce the life of christ
[1:34:45] for that age
[1:34:47] but then the life had to be produced and
[1:34:50] come
[1:34:51] in a
[1:34:53] flesh form in the form
[1:34:56] of a
[1:34:57] baby boy
[1:34:59] who later became jesus christ
[1:35:02] when the word matured
[1:35:06] it revealed itself that it was jesus
[1:35:08] christ
[1:35:10] god in christ emmanuel
[1:35:13] now in this day
[1:35:15] god sent not gabriel but the seventh
[1:35:18] angel
[1:35:20] is that right explain to you who the
[1:35:22] seventh day angel really was
[1:35:24] amen and the word came to us
[1:35:28] and now in this this
[1:35:31] manger of our souls of our hearts
[1:35:34] this manger of this sinful body
[1:35:37] uh you know with all kind of cattle
[1:35:39] urine and straw and everything else
[1:35:43] the word came to be born in you and i
[1:35:48] that it would create a paradox
[1:35:50] about how could god be in you
[1:35:53] what would you talking about
[1:35:55] somebody like you i know you i know him
[1:35:58] i know her
[1:35:59] that's got nothing to do with it
[1:36:01] it's happened and it's going on right
[1:36:03] now it's just the fact you're saying
[1:36:05] that means you ain't see it you
[1:36:07] recognize what is happening amen so god
[1:36:11] brought us some places in this age that
[1:36:13] the eagle might find us that he might
[1:36:15] have another virgin bride amen that will
[1:36:20] produce the life of jesus
[1:36:22] christ not create the life
[1:36:26] but produce the life
[1:36:29] because jesus christ was not from mary
[1:36:33] jesus christ the word the seed of god
[1:36:36] the original seed only
[1:36:38] pass through mary so that he could make
[1:36:41] himself manifest hallelujah
[1:36:44] and that is what is happening right now
[1:36:47] the word passing through processing
[1:36:49] itself until it comes to a full
[1:36:52] manifestation and revelation in the
[1:36:54] bride of jesus christ
[1:36:56] amen
[1:36:57] at that day
[1:37:00] then you'll know
[1:37:01] that i'm in the father
[1:37:03] and the father in me
[1:37:06] and i in you
[1:37:08] praise god brother branham said that is
[1:37:10] this day
[1:37:12] this day that we are living in god is
[1:37:15] doing that
[1:37:16] praise the lord jesus christ oh my
[1:37:19] there's so many things you because if i
[1:37:21] go in those angles you know these quotes
[1:37:23] let's say he says the true anointed of
[1:37:26] god he comes to them that's deity
[1:37:29] speaking
[1:37:30] do you know he said little messiah x why
[1:37:34] they are children of the most high god
[1:37:37] [Music]
[1:37:39] god produce goat horse produce
[1:37:41] horse
[1:37:42] god is going to produce what
[1:37:44] there's got to be little gods
[1:37:46] that's why he said don't you know jesus
[1:37:48] himself said that the prophets were
[1:37:50] already called god what what is it
[1:37:52] strange that you will think
[1:37:54] that i tell you that i am the son of god
[1:37:58] i am the body that jehovah is now
[1:38:01] dwelling in
[1:38:02] but we're not saying that we are many
[1:38:05] many little
[1:38:07] parts of him praise god that he could
[1:38:10] live in move in and have his being to
[1:38:12] fulfill the scripture that's on the wall
[1:38:15] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:38:19] praise god living not in jesus back
[1:38:22] there because jesus
[1:38:25] no let me not go there but you see
[1:38:27] living in jesus back there
[1:38:30] but living in you and i here
[1:38:33] of course you feel yourself unworthy
[1:38:38] and if you feel yourself worthy then
[1:38:40] forget it but but uh you feel unworthy
[1:38:44] because brother brown said you're still
[1:38:46] gonna be making mistakes
[1:38:48] he says this sticky nature here gonna be
[1:38:50] with you till you go out to here
[1:38:53] why because it's satan that's got the
[1:38:56] prerogative to work and influence and
[1:38:58] maneuver and manipulate this outside man
[1:39:02] that he got some control
[1:39:04] over it as a as a so-called elder
[1:39:07] brother he wants to play across this but
[1:39:10] he can't touch the gene that was in
[1:39:13] other
[1:39:13] side
[1:39:14] [Applause]
[1:39:16] hallelujah and that gene is only
[1:39:18] anointed to believe
[1:39:21] it's only anointed to do certain things
[1:39:23] all these things you see up here it'll
[1:39:26] do all those things all you have to be
[1:39:28] certain of god
[1:39:30] that the gene of god in that day he said
[1:39:33] what day this day
[1:39:35] at that day when this revelation is
[1:39:39] being made known you will know i am in
[1:39:42] the father the father in me i and you
[1:39:45] when the revelation now
[1:39:48] begins to be mad manifest hallelujah
[1:39:52] at that
[1:39:53] you will know that i and the father are
[1:39:57] one hallelujah that you and the lord you
[1:40:01] and the pillar of fire you and him are
[1:40:04] one praise god that day this day you
[1:40:08] begin to know that praise the lord
[1:40:11] glory to god hallelujah amen oh my i'm
[1:40:15] gonna have to start winding this up and
[1:40:18] i still have to go go go praise god
[1:40:21] hallelujah but i want you to know no no
[1:40:24] [Music]
[1:40:25] amen glory to god hallelujah amen
[1:40:30] now
[1:40:30] i'm quoting out of christ as a mischief
[1:40:33] god revealed because these books these
[1:40:36] sermons we have heard
[1:40:38] at least me
[1:40:39] hundreds of times and read them and or
[1:40:42] mark and everything else
[1:40:44] and and now the holy spirit is making
[1:40:46] you see things that were always there
[1:40:49] but it wasn't the time for you to see
[1:40:52] that
[1:40:53] he's making themselves known listen
[1:40:55] now
[1:40:56] that day when the revelation is making
[1:40:59] itself manifest i'm talking about the
[1:41:01] manifested life of jesus christ amen
[1:41:04] hallelujah at that day you shall know
[1:41:09] amen
[1:41:10] i'm just going to pause in the sentence
[1:41:12] there so you get the emphasis that this
[1:41:14] is the day when you shall know
[1:41:17] praise god are you starting to know
[1:41:19] are you starting to know
[1:41:22] are you starting to come up to your
[1:41:23] amnesia
[1:41:25] are you starting to recognize understand
[1:41:27] and see what god's plan was which he
[1:41:31] could not make known to the princes of
[1:41:33] this world but he made it known to his
[1:41:36] with his love secrets to his beloved
[1:41:38] bride that she will recognize and know
[1:41:41] who she is
[1:41:42] and who he is
[1:41:44] where you come from
[1:41:46] and where you're going to amen
[1:41:48] praise the name of the lord amen
[1:41:52] i am in the father the father in me
[1:41:55] then
[1:41:56] when the revelation comes forth
[1:42:00] then
[1:42:01] it's
[1:42:02] i
[1:42:03] then it's i in you
[1:42:06] when the revelation begins to come forth
[1:42:09] it's not you no more
[1:42:10] it's not not not you no more having to
[1:42:13] put on anything act anything struggle
[1:42:15] with anything fighting
[1:42:17] to be a christian or whatever it's not
[1:42:19] you anymore brother branham says here
[1:42:22] amen i think that's page 65 crisis he
[1:42:25] says but
[1:42:27] you see it's then it's i in you
[1:42:31] and you and me
[1:42:33] praise the name of the lord glory to god
[1:42:36] hallelujah amen
[1:42:38] now
[1:42:40] this is a thought where we will turn a
[1:42:42] little corner here
[1:42:43] because i've been preaching a lot to
[1:42:45] this
[1:42:46] and showing you that we were always in
[1:42:50] him
[1:42:51] before the foundations is that right how
[1:42:54] many hear me preach that many times
[1:42:57] different angles emphasize it
[1:43:00] what i'm doing and what i'm saying is
[1:43:03] that he's turned our attention yes
[1:43:05] you you were in him but i want you to
[1:43:08] see now this is the time and the hour
[1:43:11] and the season when the emphasis is on
[1:43:15] me being in you
[1:43:18] i in you
[1:43:20] praise the name of the living god
[1:43:23] hallelujah because we know that that we
[1:43:26] were in him before the foundations of
[1:43:29] the world amen before there was ever a
[1:43:32] time something called time or there ever
[1:43:35] was a world we were already in him
[1:43:38] praise the lord amen but we found out
[1:43:42] praise god
[1:43:43] that we he is now in us
[1:43:46] and talking to us
[1:43:48] giving us clear revelation
[1:43:51] and giving us
[1:43:53] uh not a denominational interpretation
[1:43:57] but a clear
[1:43:59] revelation and interpretation of himself
[1:44:03] for it is
[1:44:04] god who is his own interpreter
[1:44:08] interpreting his own word
[1:44:11] praise god
[1:44:13] doing that it's god doing that and we
[1:44:15] give him glory praise and honor may the
[1:44:18] lord bless you i trust that even if
[1:44:21] you received only uh you know
[1:44:25] a little toast with butter this morning
[1:44:29] that the holy spirit
[1:44:31] will satisfy you
[1:44:34] and like elijah
[1:44:35] on those bread that dry bread brought to
[1:44:39] him
[1:44:40] by by the birds
[1:44:42] i trust and he went 40 days in the
[1:44:44] strength of that bread i trust god will
[1:44:47] give you the same kindness as the
[1:44:49] musicians are coming we'll give you that
[1:44:51] same kind of strength
[1:44:54] and grace hallelujah
[1:44:58] praise god
[1:44:59] when all them brooks dry up
[1:45:03] and they're drying up fast
[1:45:05] until they're saying all kinds of
[1:45:07] ridiculous stuff
[1:45:10] when they're saying all these ridiculous
[1:45:12] stuff you can more see clearly they
[1:45:15] don't have a clue
[1:45:17] they may hear with the ears
[1:45:19] somebody's saying what's going on
[1:45:22] but they don't have any part in it
[1:45:26] and they're saying all kinds of stuff
[1:45:29] prophet said you start from one point
[1:45:32] and if when you started
[1:45:33] you were off even just a teeny weeny bit
[1:45:36] later on when that thing mature and you
[1:45:38] go out out you find that you're hundreds
[1:45:41] of miles away from your original
[1:45:44] destination of where you wanted to go
[1:45:47] is that right
[1:45:48] a lot of ministers a lot of believers
[1:45:52] that just one little thing little here
[1:45:54] and
[1:45:55] they start to as he said they start to
[1:45:57] go off into the weeds
[1:46:00] hey man you know how it is if a person
[1:46:02] come off the road then the vehicle go
[1:46:04] down in the weeds
[1:46:07] we don't want to find ourselves in the
[1:46:08] weeds we want to find ourselves in the
