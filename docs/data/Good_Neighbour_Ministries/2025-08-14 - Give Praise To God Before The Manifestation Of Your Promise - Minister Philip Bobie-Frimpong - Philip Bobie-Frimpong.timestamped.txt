[19:42] Sunday. Let's hear your voice and just
[19:44] praise God for the word that came. I
[19:47] need the musicians to stay a little bit.
[19:50] Um we thank God for sending our former
[19:54] pastor to come and bless us and so
[19:56] wonderful. I'm still feisting on that
[19:58] word of God. We are privileged people
[20:02] just um to sing holy belief before we we
[20:07] stand.
[20:09] Fear not the Lord's only belief.

[21:05] All
[21:08] you
[21:09] [Music]
[21:11] all
[21:13] are possible.
[21:19] [Music]
[21:29] All
[21:31] baby.
[21:34] [Music]
[21:35] [Applause]
[21:37] [Music]
[21:41] Oh,
[21:44] I want to hear the piano now. The piano
[21:50] goat.
[21:59] [Music]
[22:36] Let's pray. Oh our heavenly most
[22:39] gracious eternal God. We so thankful
[22:42] that your grace has made a way for us to
[22:45] be here tonight. You only tell us to
[22:48] only believe and all things are possible
[22:50] to them that believe Father and we are
[22:53] believers. Father we have confidence in
[22:55] your word that we are holy all that you
[22:57] ask us father to just fully believe. At
[23:00] this moment we commit brother Bill and
[23:02] his son Junior into thy hand as he said
[23:06] that he had a double pneumonia. At least
[23:08] they found what the causes but father
[23:11] that sickness couldn't hide from you and
[23:13] once that you have let him found the
[23:16] cause we know that you are still a
[23:18] healer. May you go and touch him
[23:20] wherever he is at this time. May you
[23:22] touch brother Bill and touch brother
[23:24] Bill Junior. May they be made whole
[23:27] right now. Father, there is no distance
[23:29] in prayer. Your word clarify,
[23:35] you will grant it to us. We said you
[23:37] receive not because we ask not. And you
[23:39] are not asking in the midst. We are
[23:40] asking specifically for the healing of
[23:43] our brother that you touch him and the
[23:46] son Junior. What kind of virus is we
[23:49] don't know. But Father, may you root out
[23:52] that cause of the virus and may they
[23:54] both be made whole. Even right now, even
[23:57] on the on the YouTube or in here, if
[24:00] anyone is sick, may your Holy Ghost
[24:03] touch them and heal them because your
[24:05] word clearly said you are the Lord God
[24:07] that heal all our disease. Father, I
[24:10] pray that you take me aside tonight and
[24:12] use me for your glory. And may you bless
[24:15] the remainder of the service who come to
[24:17] read the word. May you come and speak to
[24:19] us once more because our confidence that
[24:22] you are the same yesterday to today
[24:24] forever and we thank you for hearing our
[24:27] prayer. We give you all the other and
[24:29] the glory. Anything unlike the father we
[24:30] come against it. May your great holy
[24:33] ghost have reminance and speak to the
[24:36] heart of your children in Jesus name.
[24:39] Amen. Please be seated. Hallelujah. So I
[24:43] have couple of scriptures. Sorry for
[24:46] keeping you standing. Let's read our
[24:48] scriptures. Um, Romans chapter 4. I'm
[24:51] not going to
[24:53] Can you please stand up for the respect
[24:55] of the word? Romans 4:7 and 8. And then
[25:02] Romans 4:13-20.
[25:08] Okay. In Romans 4:7 and 8 said that
[25:11] saying,
[25:13] "Blessed are they whose iniquity are
[25:16] forgiven and whose sins are covered.
[25:20] Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[25:22] not impute sin." Um verse 13, for the
[25:29] promise that he should be the heir
[25:33] of the world was not to Abraham or to
[25:36] his seed through the law, but through
[25:39] the righteousness of faith. For if they
[25:43] which are of the law be faith is made
[25:47] void, and the promise made of none
[25:50] effect, because the law workketh wrath.
[25:53] For where no law is, there is no
[25:56] transgression.
[25:58] Therefore, it is of faith that it might
[26:01] be by grace to the end of the promise
[26:04] might be sure to all the seed, not to
[26:07] that only which is of the law, but to
[26:10] that also which is of the faith of
[26:12] Abraham, who is the father of us all. 17
[26:16] as it is written, I have made thee a
[26:19] father of many nations before him whom
[26:23] he believed, even God who quickened the
[26:25] dead and called those things which be
[26:28] not as though they were. Who against
[26:31] hope? I might think based more here. Who
[26:34] against hope believe in hope that he
[26:37] might become the father of many nations
[26:40] according to that which was spoken so
[26:43] shall thy seed be. Verse 19. And being
[26:46] not weak in faith, he considered not his
[26:49] own body, now dead, when he was about
[26:53] 100 years old, neither here yet the
[26:55] deadness of Sarah's womb. Verse 20. His
[26:58] target not at the promise of God, true
[27:02] unbelief, but was strong in faith,
[27:06] giving glory to God. Heavenly Father,
[27:10] please bless the reading of your word in
[27:13] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[27:16] Please be seated.
[27:18] Amen. So, if I'll title it, I got this
[27:21] thought from my last prayer meeting, but
[27:24] uh I didn't talk about it, but I just
[27:27] want to talk about it now.
[27:29] So
[27:34] my title is
[27:36] give praise to God before the
[27:39] manifestation
[27:40] of your promise or because benefit of
[27:43] your uh yeah give praise to God before
[27:47] the manifestation of your promise.
[27:52] Abraham had to believe just what the
[27:54] voice told him. Remember in the time of
[27:57] Abraham there was no physical Bible for
[28:00] them to read. God deal with them with a
[28:03] voice and they have confidence in that
[28:05] voice that they heard that it was God's
[28:07] voice speaking to them because the Bible
[28:09] was written after Moses time. So they
[28:12] were not privileged like that. You have
[28:14] like something as a yard stick to match
[28:17] it by because but because the seed of
[28:20] God was in them they could recognize
[28:22] that voice and act on that voice. And
[28:25] when he was 100 years old, 25 years
[28:29] later, he was stronger believing
[28:32] it than when he was 25 years ago when it
[28:35] was given to him. So like people that
[28:39] have been around
[28:41] now is a time that your faith even has
[28:44] to be more stronger than when you
[28:46] receive the the promise. Normally you
[28:50] like to go back when God called us so
[28:52] many things will happen. But the same
[28:54] God if you have seen of Abraham as the
[28:58] time is going and even like myself I
[29:01] used to say that um when I got married I
[29:06] said I'll never have a teenage children
[29:08] because by that time the rapture will be
[29:10] like gone. So people talking about their
[29:13] teenage problem so it's never going to
[29:14] happen to me. But then it's here they
[29:18] are almost 18 going on. But what I'm
[29:21] trying to say that that shouldn't weaken
[29:24] your faith. You should still have that
[29:26] confidence and your faith should be
[29:28] stronger and expect him to come at any
[29:30] time. Amen. And it was he he believed it
[29:35] and he staggered not at the promise of
[29:38] God through unbelief but was strong
[29:41] giving praise to God knowing that he was
[29:43] able to perform what he had promised.
[29:47] Grace, can you put it on for me?
[29:50] and paragraph 20 that's you must come
[29:52] with an unfailing faith believing that
[29:55] God made the promise but now you have to
[29:58] be in a position to have that faith and
[30:00] that's where we are going to talk on uh
[30:04] paragraph 226
[30:07] it works with works
[30:11] with works with faith whatever at 100
[30:17] years paragraph 226 is grace.
[30:23] Yeah. At 100 years, I think I got
[30:26] everything from works is faith
[30:28] expressed. That's why I'm basing my
[30:31] thoughts on works is faith expressed.
[30:33] Paragraph 226 at 100 years old. Look,
[30:38] his body now dead, his manhood and
[30:41] Sarah's womb dead. It wasn't even
[30:44] considered. So tonight you don't have to
[30:48] consider your condition.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; You don't have to consider your
[30:56] position. You are paratic or whatever
[30:59] you are isn't considered. The wheelchair
[31:02] is not under consideration for the
[31:05] little boy may be paralyzed. Whatever it
[31:08] is, I don't know. It is under not under
[31:12] consideration.
[31:14] Don't even consider it.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the doctor said he never got
[31:20] out of here. The doctor said she will
[31:23] never come. That's not even considered.
[31:27] Well, look, I'm an old person. I'm
[31:30] getting noodle age. Not even considered.
[31:34] And we are the children of Abraham, not
[31:36] as Isaac, but his royal seed through
[31:38] Christ. By faith that he had Abraham's
[31:41] seed coming forth in the last days to
[31:43] shine like the stars, Abraham's
[31:46] children. Considered not his own body
[31:48] now dead, neither even considered it. It
[31:52] wasn't even brought into question
[31:54] whether God will do it or not. God said
[31:58] it, he would do it. Why? It was revealed
[32:02] to him. Amen. When it's revealed to you,
[32:07] &gt;&gt; you can't make it happen. It's got to be
[32:10] revealed to you.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; Then you don't even consider anything.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Else how impossible it is. Don't
[32:20] consider what the doctor said. You don't
[32:22] consider what mama said, what papa said,
[32:25] what the preacher said, what anybody
[32:29] else said. You just consider what God
[32:33] said.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, you don't look at your
[32:36] condition. Look to that promise of God.
[32:40] &gt;&gt; And God promises above all things at
[32:43] which you prosper and be in health even
[32:46] as your soul prospered.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; Any other thing you reject it as a son
[32:51] or daughter of God. Even though your
[32:55] present condition might not show it, the
[32:58] daughters can give their report.
[33:00] Everyone can say whatever they said. But
[33:02] the true seed of God, a true seed of
[33:04] Abraham, you will not consider them.
[33:08] You're going to give thanks to God as
[33:11] Abraham was because Abraham did not wait
[33:15] until he see the manifestation before
[33:18] giving thanks to God. And so many of us
[33:21] when God give us promise or something is
[33:24] delaying, we pray over it. You I know I
[33:27] believe that a child that cries more, he
[33:31] gets the best. You keep on crying,
[33:32] crying, crying. But there has to be a
[33:34] time that the crying has to end because
[33:36] just like that um
[33:40] the widow that bothered that judge after
[33:43] a while the judge get worried and ask
[33:45] give her request to her. But what I'm
[33:47] trying to say is that as a true son of
[33:50] God, when you prayed and God answered
[33:54] the prayer, you know it's answered.
[33:57] Nobody has to tell you.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; And once you know that is answered, you
[34:01] don't go back to God and begging for it
[34:03] again.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; That's the time for you to give him
[34:05] praise.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; That's the time for you to thank God as
[34:08] you have received it p physically. Even
[34:11] though you you you don't hold it in your
[34:14] hand but come so red to you that you are
[34:17] received the thing so you can give him
[34:19] thanks and praise no matter how a longer
[34:22] it linger you don't have to look at the
[34:25] condition
[34:26] &gt;&gt; look at that promise and give God thanks
[34:29] give him praise give him the glory give
[34:31] him the honor because he alone deserve
[34:34] our glory amen he deserve to be praised
[34:37] he deserve to be worshiped so you have
[34:39] to thank him for it in advance hands in
[34:41] anticipation expecting that thing to
[34:44] happen and in between that period the
[34:47] enemy is going to test you.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Your faith is going to be tested.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Don't you're not going to have it easy
[34:55] because it's a battle. Is that right?
[34:58] And it says that by violence you take it
[35:00] by force
[35:02] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of heaven.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; So you going to be faced a battle. But
[35:07] remember the battle is the loss. You
[35:09] have to keep on confessing your faith
[35:11] because Jesus Christ is the word.
[35:13] Confessional proration of our faith.
[35:15] Confession of our faith. So you got to
[35:17] keep on confessing, confessing and
[35:20] believe until that thing manifest life.
[35:24] You have an example of brother Abraham
[35:26] ministry about r the blind mind the Ryan
[35:31] John Ryan. He went to the ministry. He
[35:34] went to uh the prayer line. A bra
[35:38] revealed his heart. He told him
[35:40] everything. He said, "You are healed."
[35:43] And he went back. He was still blind as
[35:45] blind can be. He came back again. And
[35:48] then he said,
[35:51] "You are healed." He said, "I cannot
[35:55] see." He said, "Do you believe me what I
[35:57] said? I believe it." Said they go and
[35:59] confess. He been a Catholic. Then he
[36:01] start confessing. He start confessing.
[36:03] Praise God for healing me. Even though
[36:05] his physical eye was blind, but he did
[36:08] not consider that blindness of his
[36:10] physical eye. People were laughing at
[36:12] him. People were mocking at him. But he
[36:15] kept on saying, "Praise God for healing
[36:17] me. Praise God for healing me. Praise
[36:20] God for healing me." He confessed that
[36:22] until finally when he went to a place
[36:25] that the barber thought he was going to
[36:27] mock him and that mockery bring what?
[36:31] the the opening of his eyes and he did
[36:34] not walk he did not care about what that
[36:37] baba was saying he did not consider that
[36:40] baba's word he considered the promise of
[36:43] God because it was revealed to him when
[36:47] he went to the second time something
[36:50] happened in his heart and he believed
[36:52] that he was healed so no matter how much
[36:54] people were making mockery of him that
[36:57] mockery didn't mean nothing to him he
[37:00] pro he confessed confess he confessed
[37:02] and what his eyes would pop open like
[37:05] that.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. There are two examples that he
[37:08] gave about two women who came for the
[37:11] prayer meeting they have cancer and
[37:13] other sickness and they too one of them
[37:17] husband was saying that you bringing
[37:20] reproach to the gospel. He said that if
[37:22] you were to be in my position you
[37:24] wouldn't say I'm bringing reproach. She
[37:26] kept on confessing, confessing until
[37:29] that thing he and she cough it out and
[37:33] both of them got healed at the same
[37:35] time. So what am I trying to say
[37:37] tonight? That when God reveals something
[37:40] to you, you got to give him praise. You
[37:42] got to give him glory. You have to thank
[37:45] him for it. Don't consider your
[37:47] situation. Don't look at yourself, but
[37:50] look to the promise. Because by faith,
[37:52] Abraham, everyone
[37:55] that pleased God in the Hebrews, it's
[37:57] impossible to please God without faith.
[38:00] And faith is a revelation.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So it was revealed to the saints
[38:05] of old. By faith, Abraham, by faith,
[38:08] Enoch, by faith, David, by faith, every
[38:11] one of them has to base their confidence
[38:16] in the faith of God, in the revealed
[38:18] word of God. So without you having faith
[38:22] in God or having received that faith of
[38:26] God and revelation of a situation, you
[38:29] only going to confess it. You only going
[38:31] to have a knowledge of it. But when it's
[38:34] revealed to you, it become a different
[38:36] ball game. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[38:42] So what what am I trying to say? Even in
[38:46] my own life, we had a little experience
[38:48] for our daughter Grace.
[38:50] Um when she was like two, three years.
[38:54] One time
[38:56] she was coughing like crazy and then
[38:59] they gave her a puff. So you were using
[39:03] the puff all the time. The more you even
[39:06] using the puff, the more she kept on
[39:08] coughing. And her mom become so
[39:12] devastated. So one time when I came back
[39:15] from work the mom was so sad and crying
[39:18] and said I don't know what to do and I
[39:22] said I don't know I believe that
[39:24] inspiration strike me and at that very
[39:26] moment I told her hey Rose you read the
[39:30] Bible it said Abraham never target at
[39:34] the promise of God he was constantly
[39:37] giving praise he waited for 25 years he
[39:40] never doubted this is just a couple of
[39:43] months and you crying, forget it. God
[39:45] will take control. And when that word
[39:48] was spoken and inspiration, the
[39:51] following day we went to the doctor, the
[39:54] doctor checked her, everything was gone.
[39:56] Why? She was 100% healed. Why? Because
[39:59] the inspiration strike and I believe
[40:02] that the same God that was there with
[40:05] Abraham that took 25 years, this was
[40:08] just couple of month, it was nothing to
[40:10] God. And God came on the scene and
[40:13] touched her and she never used that puff
[40:15] out to now because then precise asmetic
[40:18] condition and there's nothing found over
[40:21] there until now she's leaving a hole.
[40:23] Why? God did it. The same God that was
[40:26] in Abraham that faith that Abraham had I
[40:30] have a little to prove that God is also
[40:32] what in our midst because he's the same
[40:35] yesterday today and forever. Brother M
[40:38] and Kofford say that if God appeared to
[40:40] Moses, why can't he appear to me?
[40:42] Because he's the same God. He's not a
[40:44] dead God. Whatever he did to them, he
[40:46] has to do the same thing in our lives.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if we are not seeing the
[40:50] same thing in our life, then we playing
[40:52] church. We playing games. Because that
[40:55] God is in our midst.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; He hasn't died. He's the same yesterday,
[41:00] today, and forever. Amen. And I remember
[41:04] in the years 2000 or before then or
[41:06] after that when by God's grace I started
[41:10] coming to here visiting our local that
[41:12] time we were in um Bruce
[41:15] a friend a Christian friend called me
[41:18] from another province and we were
[41:21] chatting and he was telling me that oh
[41:24] Phil in the North America here we don't
[41:27] see no supernatural because
[41:31] people have everything that they have
[41:33] need of. But in Africa because the
[41:36] people are hungry and they don't have
[41:38] nothing, they have to believe God even
[41:41] for food. So we see a lot of
[41:43] supernatural and we are not seeing the
[41:45] supernatural in our local church over
[41:48] here. And I said bro talking the wrong
[41:51] person where I fellowship. I'm seeing
[41:53] God every day.
[41:55] &gt;&gt; I'm seeing that supernatural. I'm seeing
[41:57] God in our midst. And I was telling him
[41:59] how even somebody came how the church
[42:03] dedicating time they took a picture of
[42:05] the signboard and they saw an eagle in
[42:08] there as a form of a pillar of fire. And
[42:10] when even somebody came to the church to
[42:13] make a disturbances and then the pastor
[42:15] said you cannot disturb. You have to go.
[42:18] And then when he went he was still
[42:20] bothering the brother in his home. And
[42:22] that brother called cops. And when cops
[42:25] came, the man was going to try to lie
[42:28] again on him. And when he began to die,
[42:30] boom, heart attack, he died right there.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. The same thing that happened in
[42:35] the book of Acts. When Ananas and Safari
[42:38] died, they died right there. And the
[42:42] people saw the power of God. It brings
[42:44] fierce reverence the people because they
[42:47] saw that God was in their midst. And
[42:49] that same God is here tonight.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might not see it constantly,
[42:53] but that super spiritual is behind this
[42:56] church.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; He's moving every day and then you might
[42:59] not see it, but that same God is here.
[43:01] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[43:03] forever. So I began to talk to him what
[43:05] God is doing in my life and other
[43:07] believers. And he saw the difference
[43:09] that God is the same yesterday, today,
[43:12] and forever. He's not only limited to a
[43:15] geographical people, to only one side of
[43:18] people. If you believe God and you apply
[43:20] it, it will work everywhere at every
[43:23] point in time. Amen. Because it's a
[43:26] visible union of Christ. It's a mystical
[43:29] body of Christ. Amen. So when you are in
[43:31] that mystical body of Christ, it doesn't
[43:34] matter your geographical location. He's
[43:36] going to be here to meet your needs.
[43:38] He's going to show up in your midst.
[43:40] You're going to show up in your prayers.
[43:42] You're going to show up in everything
[43:43] that your hand tight because he's
[43:45] unchanging God. He's the same yesterday,
[43:49] today, and forever. Amen. Our God is
[43:52] good.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; He never change. Amen. So
[43:58] somewhere explained that in the church
[44:01] ages book, revelation is vital to every
[44:06] Christian.
[44:07] You need revelation more than anything
[44:10] else in the church ages book. So when
[44:12] you look at David and his brothers, the
[44:17] difference between David and King Saul
[44:20] and his big brothers was revelation.
[44:23] Because his brothers, they know, they
[44:27] knew that they were serving a living
[44:29] God. And God that they were serving is
[44:33] more than able to defeat Goladat.
[44:37] They have that knowledge, but it was not
[44:40] revealed to them.
[44:41] And I'm afraid
[44:44] so many people in this message of the
[44:46] hour around the message have a lot of
[44:50] knowledge of what God has done through
[44:53] the prophet but they themselves have no
[44:56] experience. They have no revelation.
[44:59] They have not even experienced one thing
[45:01] that happened in his life. But if that
[45:04] same God is the same yesterday, today
[45:07] and forever and he dealt with the
[45:09] prophet in that manner and if you
[45:11] receive the same Holy Ghost that came in
[45:14] that prophet then that same thing will
[45:16] follow you. It might not be in a big way
[45:18] like his ministry but they're going to
[45:20] be the traces because remember in the
[45:23] book of acts when the people saw uh John
[45:26] and Peter they realize that they are
[45:29] being with Jesus Christ because they
[45:31] action prove it. So when you are
[45:34] pregnant you got when you are pregnant
[45:36] that pregnant will show and to give
[45:38] birth. So if you have Christ and you
[45:41] have met him in your life people has to
[45:44] identify will see that God that you have
[45:47] met because they recognize that they
[45:49] were ignorant and unlearned but they
[45:52] have been with Jesus Christ. So if you
[45:56] say you have
[45:58] then those traces has to follow your
[46:02] life.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I said this time shall
[46:05] follow them that believe
[46:07] &gt;&gt; in my name they shall cast out devils.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; They will lay their hands on the sick.
[46:12] They shall recover. Amen. They will eat
[46:16] poison to not harm them. So if you
[46:21] believe you don't see for those signs
[46:25] it automatically follow you.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you are not looking for
[46:30] the signs but once that word is revealed
[46:33] to you automatically happens
[46:36] &gt;&gt; and God moves when he wants to.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; We can't push God's hands. We don't
[46:42] force God. We just lead a simple
[46:45] Christian life and God come on the scene
[46:49] when he needs to.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. He comes in his own time.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. And that gives a
[46:58] confidence.
[46:59] He's the same yesterday, today, and
[47:02] forever. Ah, God is on time God.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; He will never leave. He never forsake
[47:07] you. Amen. Hallelujah. So what am I
[47:11] trying to say? that David he caught
[47:14] inspiration by the moment
[47:17] that his brothers missed the mark
[47:22] because they just have the head
[47:24] knowledge
[47:25] they didn't have the revelation that
[47:28] make the difference and when the people
[47:33] revelation is a thought of God
[47:36] &gt;&gt; and you cannot give yourself revelation
[47:38] but if that seed of God is hiding there
[47:42] when the time comes God himself come on
[47:45] the scene and reveal himself. Amen. So
[47:49] what am I trying to say? If we take
[47:52] someone
[47:54] like um the thief on the cross
[47:59] when he was just about to die,
[48:03] he said the right word at the right time
[48:06] and he was with God in paradise.
[48:10] You can take someone
[48:12] like Samson.
[48:16] He was facing the enemy.
[48:19] Thousand Philistines were after him and
[48:22] the inspiration just strike him. Pick
[48:25] just a jawbone. It wasn't a jawbone but
[48:29] his confidence was in God. It was
[48:32] revealed to him that God is able to do
[48:33] anything. With God all things are
[48:36] possible. Amen. And so he didn't look at
[48:38] the condition. He wasn't scared about
[48:40] the people. Once he could felt the
[48:42] presence of God, he picked up the
[48:44] jawbone that was very loose, that was
[48:46] very thin and defeated thousand
[48:49] Philistines because it inspiration
[48:52] strike him. And you have to be at the
[48:55] moment
[48:57] in about 2000 for about 10 for 10 15
[49:03] years ago. I used to work for a client
[49:06] and that client I asked him hey what
[49:10] kind of job do you do you always at
[49:11] home? He was building building he built
[49:15] nice house and moving he said you don't
[49:17] know what kind of job I do I do a day
[49:20] trading and he was explaining to me that
[49:23] when they do that trading
[49:27] is about the price of the stocks. So
[49:30] sometimes he has to be able to
[49:34] buy the thing at a low price and sell it
[49:37] high. But if he miss the price, it goes
[49:41] high. He can never buy it. And when he
[49:44] makes to selling it, the thing can come
[49:47] down like and he loses all his money. So
[49:51] it's like in the moment you have to
[49:53] catch what is going on. So is the word
[49:57] of God. You have to have that revelation
[50:00] to catch the thing right there. Because
[50:03] if you missing state, that's it. because
[50:05] that is what happened to um I believe um
[50:09] Esau and Judas. They afterward sought
[50:14] with repentance but there was nothing
[50:17] found in them. It was too late. But you
[50:20] see those with the seed of God, they
[50:23] just catch it like that. They just catch
[50:25] like that effortlessly.
[50:27] They just can just catch that revelation
[50:30] and act on the word of God. Amen. So you
[50:34] must be in the moment. So is even this
[50:37] message that we have.
[50:40] Whatever dilut has it couldn't work in
[50:44] the time of Wesley. Whatever Wesley had
[50:48] could not work in the time of the
[50:49] Pentecost that time and in our time
[50:52] whatever fall in the Pentecost it cannot
[50:55] also work today. You have to find what
[50:58] God is doing now. the present stage of
[51:03] his ministry. That has to be revealed
[51:06] and has to be clear to you in order for
[51:08] you to please God. Because eagles eat
[51:11] fresh skill, fresh food, fresh
[51:14] anointing, fresh inspiration,
[51:17] inspiration for now, present tense
[51:20] revelation.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; And that manner if you leave it for the
[51:24] next day, it will rot.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; You need the mana for today. Hallelujah.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; That's only thing that can admit today's
[51:33] experience. Listen, we are living in a
[51:35] time that is a wicked age.
[51:39] The enemy has come to the highest point.
[51:43] Is that right? And even if you look
[51:48] like military,
[51:51] you cannot go and use those bow. It was
[51:54] a bow. The time they use a bow in
[51:56] Africa. They use the bow and all those
[51:58] things to go and fight. Even AK-47 will
[52:01] not do the work today. You have to have
[52:04] sophisticated machines for the present
[52:06] time. Now they using ballistic materials
[52:09] and nuclear and all those things and
[52:12] drones that could specifically go and
[52:15] kill the enemy target and without
[52:18] destroying anything. So you have to be
[52:20] that high in this age to be able to what
[52:23] meet the condition of the age. So you
[52:26] cannot fight today's condition with 100
[52:29] years as condition. Everything is
[52:31] changed. You your your weapon has to be
[52:34] sharp.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; It has to be today's weapon to meet
[52:39] today's condition.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; That's what the church need is the Holy
[52:43] Ghost for today.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; The token for today.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy going to help you to win
[52:48] the battle. You can never win it with
[52:51] yesterday's weapon. Those weapons are
[52:55] they called a cake.
[52:57] You need present conditions to meet that
[53:01] present situation. And our God is
[53:04] unchanging God.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So those bride of Christ their
[53:10] eyes are wide. Amen. Amen. They are
[53:13] looking the eagle his eyes see
[53:15] everything. Hallelujah. Our God is
[53:19] great. He's the same yesterday to them
[53:22] forever. He will never leave you nor
[53:24] forsake you. Hallelujah. Amen.
[53:28] He deserved all all the glory and the
[53:31] honor. So we need that present tense for
[53:35] our present condition. Amen. Hallelujah.
[53:40] Our God is good.
[53:43] Amen.
[53:45] Hallelujah.
[53:48] Praise God.
[53:51] Amen.
[53:52] So what am I trying to say?
[53:56] If the Lord Jesus Christ is inside of
[53:58] you, then you become all to the people.
[54:03] I'm going to read this here. Paragraph
[54:05] 112 and 113.
[54:07] The same is the perfect fit. But Jesus
[54:10] Christ lived in a world that no one
[54:13] knowed about. He was an old person. He
[54:17] lived in a world of what? Perfect faith.
[54:20] And perfect faith
[54:23] is um perfect faith
[54:28] masters all circumstances.
[54:31] There's nothing that can stand a perfect
[54:33] fit.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he lived in a world of perfect
[54:38] faith in the perfect God in which he
[54:41] was. If we live in a perfect faith of a
[54:44] Christian to what we are, we be mystic
[54:49] to the world. The people wouldn't
[54:51] understand you.
[54:54] You walk in the spirit.
[54:56] What the spirit said will you do what is
[55:00] forbid you will not do. Then the people
[55:03] begin to say you are mystic person to
[55:07] them. That's the way it is all to all
[55:10] believers. They are mystic. The people
[55:15] don't understand because they live in a
[55:18] world to themselves.
[55:20] Jesus lived in a world that nobody else
[55:24] could touch.
[55:26] The disciples couldn't understand him
[55:29] when he spoke to them. They say this and
[55:32] then they said, "Why you talk in real?
[55:35] We don't understand this. How can this
[55:37] be?" See, there wasn't in the world that
[55:40] he lived in. See, they couldn't
[55:42] understand him. Nobody could understand
[55:44] him. Amen. So when
[55:47] Christ comes inside of you, you become
[55:50] an all person.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; But the same thing that God does, it
[55:55] manifests in you. That's why I said the
[55:57] sons and daughters of God are led by the
[56:01] spirit of God. And if you are led by the
[56:04] spirit of God, nobody can detect your
[56:08] next move.
[56:10] Today you can say you're doing this and
[56:13] then the Lord will forbid you don't do
[56:16] this and then it it what it stumbles the
[56:20] people because Satan wants something
[56:23] that is predicted so you can know this
[56:26] that that that that because you a son or
[56:28] daughter of God you led by the spirit of
[56:32] God and that spirit will lead you to
[56:35] what have victories where you least even
[56:38] what expect because he hasn't changed.
[56:42] Amen. And our God is good. He will never
[56:45] leave us nor forsake us. He's the same
[56:48] yesterday, today, and forever.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:54] And one other thing I think what I would
[56:57] like to do here
[57:00] um
[57:02] just I don't know I just feel it like I
[57:06] want I'll wrap it up and I want grace
[57:10] can you put this just make it play for
[57:13] me just maybe five minutes in a perfect
[57:16] faith paragraph 147 to
[57:20] 151
[57:22] just play
[57:24] Can you?
[57:29] Yeah, it's just 5 minutes.
[57:51] Whatever he said, God honored what he
[57:53] said.
[57:55] Think of that.
[57:57] Whatever Jesus said, God brought it to
[57:59] pass.
[58:01] So, you know, his words were God's
[58:03] words. Now, look, that same scripture
[58:07] comes right back into us again. if he
[58:10] stays to this mountain.
[58:15] Oh my I I just let that stop you still
[58:19] see because we're going to have a
[58:19] prayer. We just miss the congregation
[58:22] pray for this
[58:25] one that wants to has to go. Look,
[58:28] he knew that he pleased God. He knew
[58:32] that there was nothing on his side. God
[58:35] had already testified this is my beloved
[58:37] son in whom I'm well pleased. hear him.
[58:42] This is my beloved son in whom I'm
[58:44] pleased to dwell in at the day of his
[58:46] baptism. I'm pleased to make my abode in
[58:49] here. There's no condemnation to him at
[58:51] all. Now, when the same God comes to you
[58:54] and pleased to dwell in you, pleased to
[58:57] honor your word, what your decision is.
[59:00] What was Joshua's decision? Stand still,
[59:02] son. And it stood there.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure. What was Moses's decision?
[59:09] How many stick over the a river like
[59:11] that and call for it to open and open?
[59:14] See, whatever you ask and if you stay to
[59:16] this mountain, be moved and don't doubt.
[59:19] See, in your heart, but believe that
[59:21] what you've said will come to pass, you
[59:23] can have what you say.
[59:26] That puts you back in the word. Now,
[59:29] that's not skin milk.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; It puts you back. I know it go jumps
[59:34] right over top of you. See, because it
[59:36] can't anchor, but real Januine faith
[59:40] catches that right now.
[59:42] I've seen it, friend. Here's this Bible
[59:45] laying open before me. I've seen it
[59:47] happen, and I know it's the truth. I
[59:50] know God in heaven knows that I might
[59:52] not live through to finish this message,
[59:54] but I I know that it happened. I've seen
[59:57] it myself. I'm a witness of that word
[1:00:00] being fulfilled,
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; and I know it is the truth.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Stand and stand there and see the
[1:00:06] creator bring a living creature into
[1:00:08] existence right in presence of your eyes
[1:00:12] and shake your head and wonder and then
[1:00:14] look around and see him bring another
[1:00:16] one just exactly like it because you
[1:00:18] said so
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; and turn over here and say there will be
[1:00:23] another one there and look and there it
[1:00:25] is.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Now that's the truth. Amen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, where should we be?
[1:00:36] There's perfect faith.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; No vision.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Just speak the word.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Never saw the squirrels.
[1:00:47] He just said the scripture what it was
[1:00:51] and speak it and don't doubt it. But
[1:00:55] what you say, it'll be there. Amen.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; And I took God at his word and it was
[1:01:03] am I right?
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; That's just as powerful. And friends, as
[1:01:07] your pastor, that's just as powerful as
[1:01:10] it was when Joshua stopped the sun.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Because the sun was already there. The
[1:01:15] elements was moving and he stopped the
[1:01:16] movement. But this he brought something
[1:01:18] there that wasn't there.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; He created.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to be acquainted with a
[1:01:25] God that can take the dust of the earth
[1:01:27] someday without anything you call me
[1:01:30] back to life again that
[1:01:33] after I've been planted in the grave. Oh
[1:01:36] my, there is my faith looks up to thee.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; When he said that, you see God
[1:01:48] that and when Joshua was in need of the
[1:01:54] battle, he told the son that was element
[1:01:58] to stand still and stand still. But the
[1:02:01] same God when he came into his ministry,
[1:02:06] he spoke something square, something
[1:02:08] that was not there and it came to
[1:02:11] existence. He didn't use any original
[1:02:13] thing. He just spoke them into existence
[1:02:16] as he spoke Abraham needs into
[1:02:18] existence. When Abraham was going to
[1:02:22] sacrifice Isaac for the Lord Jesus
[1:02:26] Christ, he spoke from nowhere and
[1:02:29] brought the lamb for him to kill. So
[1:02:33] that same God is here tonight
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; to speak your needs into existence. And
[1:02:39] if that God is in you and in me, then he
[1:02:42] has to going to do exact same thing
[1:02:45] through you and me because he's the same
[1:02:48] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; And God, I believe, is going to show his
[1:02:54] bride very soon
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; with the present conditions, the things
[1:03:00] going on.
[1:03:02] are possessed. 200 million demons have
[1:03:06] been released over on that side. And if
[1:03:10] the devil and his people and his spirits
[1:03:13] and his demons are released to the
[1:03:16] highest level,
[1:03:18] what about the release of the true
[1:03:21] journey Holy Ghost to the highest point?
[1:03:24] God is still on the scene. All the
[1:03:28] angels encamp around us. The same God,
[1:03:31] the same spirit, those that was in
[1:03:34] Peter, John, the apostles, those
[1:03:37] anointing are in the right now. And God
[1:03:41] is going to show us. We are going to do
[1:03:44] a a what do we call it? A supernatural
[1:03:48] thing.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Things that the world has never seen
[1:03:51] before.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Is going to be shown to the bride. He's
[1:03:55] on time God.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; He's here with us
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; and he's going to show us supernatural
[1:04:02] upon supernatural.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. You going to see don't no one said
[1:04:07] that the one that I belong to. I'm going
[1:04:10] to see him face to face.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the world will see something
[1:04:15] they have never seen before. Because if
[1:04:20] the elements,
[1:04:22] every scripture that has fulfilled
[1:04:26] before the Lord took his bride has
[1:04:30] almost all fulfilled to the doubt.
[1:04:34] Amen. Nothing left but the coming of
[1:04:37] Christ. The only thing that is holding
[1:04:40] that those that have the attributes of
[1:04:43] God, those that are part of him that
[1:04:47] have not come to the fold, they are the
[1:04:50] only one that are wearing. And you and I
[1:04:55] are the one holding the wrath of God.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; If not for us, the whole world that we
[1:05:00] are holding them, the Holy Ghost is
[1:05:03] holding them. They can't do whatever
[1:05:04] they can. But once we are left from
[1:05:07] here, hell will lose on this earth.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; But before then, the true bride, those
[1:05:15] who are part of him, wherever they are,
[1:05:19] they will come to the fold. No wonder in
[1:05:23] the day before Calvary, he said that you
[1:05:26] not only have that ability or the
[1:05:30] ability to heal the sick, to raise the
[1:05:33] dead or but God gave us to what? Impart
[1:05:36] the Holy Ghost. You have to impart the
[1:05:39] Holy Ghost. Same Holy Ghost that you and
[1:05:42] I have received. God has given us the
[1:05:45] ability to impart it to give to others
[1:05:48] who are his seed to come into the fold
[1:05:51] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:05:54] and forever and I'm afraid
[1:05:59] what is holding most people as our
[1:06:04] pastor said last our former pastor said
[1:06:06] last Sunday sometimes the mistakes of
[1:06:10] our past
[1:06:12] the enemy
[1:06:14] always like to bring that even your
[1:06:17] present mistakes.
[1:06:20] He likes to bring that to play with your
[1:06:22] mind. But as you read from Romans 4, he
[1:06:26] said that blessed is the man whom I will
[1:06:29] not imp. And whose iniquity is what?
[1:06:34] Forgiven. So I'm encouraging you
[1:06:37] tonight. If the enemy brings anything to
[1:06:40] you in your past, you tell him that you
[1:06:43] have been bought by the blood of Christ.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. God doesn't even see your
[1:06:47] iniquities.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your sins have been washed in the
[1:06:51] blood of the lamb. It said that your
[1:06:54] seed of God remain in you and you cannot
[1:06:59] sin.
[1:07:01] Amen.
[1:07:03] If your heart condemns you not, then you
[1:07:07] ask whatever you will and God will give
[1:07:09] to you. But if you are not living right
[1:07:12] and your heart is condemning you, how
[1:07:14] can you go to him? But somewhere even
[1:07:16] said that even if your heart condemns
[1:07:18] you, God is greater than your heart.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all that God need from you is
[1:07:26] to accept your healing, accept your
[1:07:29] salvation, accept your deliverance.
[1:07:32] Believe that your sins are forgiven. Bel
[1:07:35] have that confidence that the man, that
[1:07:39] part of God in you, that attribute, it
[1:07:41] can never sin. It's just the flesh that
[1:07:45] always make mistakes. But the true
[1:07:48] attribute, the true that se that part of
[1:07:51] God that lies within you, it cannot sin.
[1:07:56] If you have the confidence and faith
[1:08:00] that God that delivered you from
[1:08:02] sickness, from drankenness, from your
[1:08:05] past life, can't he deliver you from
[1:08:07] whatever problem you facing tonight?
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; I don't know what you're going through
[1:08:11] tonight, but the same God that gave you
[1:08:15] salvation, he's here right now to give
[1:08:18] all your need to you. Ask and you shall
[1:08:21] receive. You know only thing that will
[1:08:24] hinder you
[1:08:27] if your motive and objective is not
[1:08:30] right, it will stop you from receiving
[1:08:33] whatever you have. But he said if your
[1:08:36] motive and your objective is right, then
[1:08:39] you say to this mountain, be thou
[1:08:42] removed and do not doubt in your heart.
[1:08:44] You will have what you say is based on
[1:08:48] your motive. is based on your objective.
[1:08:53] The right mental attitude will bring
[1:08:56] every promise of God to pass.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; So don't look at yourself.
[1:09:04] Don't look at your mistakes.
[1:09:07] Believe God's word and he will bring it
[1:09:10] to pass.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; He will never leave you nor forsake you.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; He didn't bring us this far to leave us.
[1:09:18] He didn't bring us this far to let us
[1:09:20] drown. There are promises in God's word
[1:09:24] for you and me and that promise is
[1:09:27] yours. You just have to take it. Apply
[1:09:31] the token. He said when
[1:09:35] SP and Silas when they were in prison
[1:09:40] and they have beaten them to the core
[1:09:44] for just casting out devils from that
[1:09:47] young girl who was what? Who was h the
[1:09:51] people were using to make money and the
[1:09:53] people got angry and they beat them and
[1:09:56] put them in chains
[1:09:58] and what happened? That same God came in
[1:10:03] the midnight. They began to pray. So I
[1:10:06] encourage you tonight when you have a
[1:10:09] problem
[1:10:11] in the midnight hour
[1:10:14] when all hopes are gone, you begin to
[1:10:17] pray. And when they begin to pray, the
[1:10:20] angel of God show up.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. And they were delivered. Amen. So
[1:10:25] it's you and me. If you have any
[1:10:28] situation and you prayed and your
[1:10:31] objective is right, God will show up at
[1:10:34] the right time. And when those angel of
[1:10:38] God, when Paul and Silas were delivered
[1:10:41] and the prison door was shaking,
[1:10:44] that centurion was going to kill himself
[1:10:48] because why? He has let the prisoners
[1:10:51] gone and there was no hope left for him
[1:10:54] because as a centurion when that thing
[1:10:57] happened he has to give his life to that
[1:10:59] and Paul is said do yourself no harm.
[1:11:04] Amen.
[1:11:05] And
[1:11:07] he said that believe God
[1:11:10] and you and your household shall be
[1:11:14] what? Be saved.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, when your
[1:11:19] household believe the same, have the
[1:11:22] same faith that you have, God is going
[1:11:24] to give them salvation. God is not a
[1:11:29] grandfather.
[1:11:31] But if your household believe the same
[1:11:34] thing that you believe, they also going
[1:11:36] to receive it.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; But it's a promise. Sometimes you may
[1:11:41] not see your children even in church or
[1:11:44] you may not see them repenting of doing
[1:11:47] that. But have to hold on to that
[1:11:49] promise because Job sacrifice and cry
[1:11:54] for his children. And when he did that,
[1:11:58] none of his children physically follow
[1:12:01] Job. But God said he gave all his
[1:12:03] children to him.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. He have all his children. So we
[1:12:08] have to have confidence. Don't look at
[1:12:11] the condition of your children.
[1:12:13] They sometime might be rebellious. They
[1:12:16] might do things but look to the promise.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; You pray for them as Job did. You do
[1:12:22] your part. And the prophet even when he
[1:12:25] has that vision, he said that all that
[1:12:28] you loved and all that loved you is
[1:12:32] given onto you. It wasn't only for
[1:12:34] Abraham. is for all those sons and
[1:12:36] daughters of God that have the same
[1:12:39] faith that the prophet had the same
[1:12:42] revelation of the word. Amen. That same
[1:12:45] God is here. You just have to be happy
[1:12:48] and serve God because you are the most
[1:12:51] privileged people on the face of this
[1:12:53] earth that God has come to you. When he
[1:12:56] saved you, millions perish.
[1:13:00] Some of us in our family, it was only us
[1:13:03] that the word came to us. And when he
[1:13:07] save us, most of them perish.
[1:13:11] Why do you think God came to you?
[1:13:14] There's something in you. There's a
[1:13:16] seed, there's attribute of him,
[1:13:18] something that you don't even know, but
[1:13:20] God only knows why he came to you out of
[1:13:23] the billions. So you have to be most
[1:13:26] happiest person on the face of this
[1:13:30] earth when the whole world is insane.
[1:13:34] When people don't know what to do
[1:13:37] but you have an anchor you have one that
[1:13:40] you can go to and take put all our
[1:13:45] burdens on him. But in conclusion,
[1:13:50] in very in in very short time, I believe
[1:13:58] that we're going to be going home.
[1:14:01] Our going home is here. This is now our
[1:14:04] salvation
[1:14:06] nearer than we can even think of. So
[1:14:10] just to conclude that as the prophet
[1:14:13] said, all things
[1:14:17] are possible to them that believe.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I have for tonight.
[1:14:24] May God bless you all. Brother Gerald,
[1:14:27] can you come and sing couple of songs
[1:14:28] and just close it?
