few minutes my mind is so uh on the word that um I have things written down here that I want to say because if I don't say them then I you know my mind gets running on the word and you don't say it anyways we have a report here we have a testimony uh praise report from Sister Sheila um of Naomi I believe it's Naomi that was admitted to the hospital last week we prayed prayer was made and God moved on the scene amen and she's home and doing well amen so we want to thank the Lord for that amen Hallelujah it's good to give praise unto the Lord amen and acknowledge his work amen before I get started in the word I just want to make my comments on the nominations of the uh being nominated for pastor um just want to thank everyone who voted for me and my wife because it's not just me it's not just brother Danny it's our wives too amen that are going to be stepping into this role amen I'm still amazed at God's great power to transform I never thought in a million years that I'd be placed in a position like this coming in 32 years ago under Pastor Simon and thinking that God could take a person like me right and and raise up to to even be nominated to for this position is a great honor amen you know with with with with man it seems impossible but With God all things are possible if we look through the flesh we look at our flesh and our weaknesses right we'll never be able to achieve anything for God but if we look to the spirit and the the spirit ability that he has amen we can we can do all things in the spirit through Christ who strengthens us that's where our Victory lies is in the spirit Hallelujah to follow a Ministry of our pastor the experience the Revelation the word it's it's it's a you know it's something to even think about me and brother Danny right but with your love with your support amen knowing that God laid a foundation here through our pastor to carry this word and carry it on your love your prayers your support and your financial giving will continue to carry this work on Amen and we're just starting moving into this position right we're you know we God has prepared us up to now what you're seeing up to now but I believe whoever steps in that office that anointing will follow and maturity and growth will take place and with you standing behind that new pastor the individual and your prayers and your support like Joshua and Caleb and lifting up their hands I believe God will do great things and continue to do great things we want to make our spiritual father and mother brother Simon sister Pam proud not just the person who stands here but each and every one of us proud to continue this work because we can see outside there's not much time left amen Hallelujah Hallelujah so let us I just want to thank you once again and I want to thank the Lord above everything for even having an opportunity even his thinking of me and his thoughts to even think I never thought like I said in a million years never thought and I was in the flesh I was going to decline but I one thing I know and the only thing I know with this whole experience with me is he's told me not to decline that's all I know the rest is walking by faith walking in in the Unseen and allowing the Holy Spirit to use us for his glory and honor let us turn to the word this morning I trust that you are expecting I I trust that you have been praying I trust that you have been talking with the Lord I trust that the Lord has been speaking to you all week amen I trust that there's Faith here this morning because without faith it's impossible to please God and without faith it's impossible for me to do anything it's Faith this morning amen because you you desire God you want more of God not what brother Tim can give you but because you want more of him amen let us turn to the word we're going to continue in the series uh The Awakening the Great Awakening that's happening and I want to title this uh this one here the last one was The Awakening power in the seed when it wakens up it comes to perfect Faith this one I want to title The Awakening power in a seed of God there is Great Awakening power in the seed of God we want to turn to Hebrews 4 12. and then we're going to read from First John 3 9. Hallelujah for the word for the word of God is quick pay attention put on your spiritual Minds let everything from the day or whatever leave it behind let's enter in is quick and Powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intense of the heart let's go to John First John 3 9. whosoever is born of God now listen doeth not commit sin whosoever is born of God do it not commit sin for his seed the attribute the part of God the word of God remaineth in him or her and he cannot sin because he is born of God wow you know Jesus said to his disciples I believe Jesus repeat it we only see what we see in the Bible and what we read but I believe Jesus repeated a lot of things over and over until he came to the place where the disciples responded back and Jesus said do you now see that's why 80 90 of preaching is preaching the same thing over and over because we don't get it we don't see it right away right but when we seek didn't see into the word of God and we seek in the spirit eventually it breaks open to us and we get it Who We Are let us pray father in the name of Jesus Christ the almighty who is in our midst not only in our midst but in US we pray in the name of Jesus Christ let Thy word go forth let the prison doors open let the chains fall off father I declare it in the name of Jesus Christ let eyes open let hearts come subject and obedient to the word this morning Grant these things father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated that's what the word is the word of God is the seed of God the seed of God is the attribute of God that lies within us everything that the word is speaking in this hour pertains to the bride pertains to you and me God is bringing his word to try to get us to realize as we're going to see as we go along here how many times the prophet through the spirit spoke when she recognizes who she is when she comes to that realization of who she is and that is what's taking place in this hour There's a Great Awakening happen in The Bride of Jesus Christ because once that Awakening comes to that place of perfect faith in her then the Rapture will go and I believe the third pull is operating now it is not true man it's through his Spirit through the revealing of the word by his spirit in this hour those that are filthy let them be filthy still those that are righteous let them be righteous still this is the hour that those scriptures are being fulfilled and filthy don't mean you know just like Wicked we look at Wicked and we look at murderers and it's not that's not what God considers Wicked unbelief manifesting in an individual is what God considers Wicked the word of God is referred to as a seed there are a total of 44 verses in the New Testament where the Greek word Sperma was translated seed to conceive and give birth to the Miracles you need and you must first plant God's word like a seed in your heart we believe the word like Mary was Mary conceived the first Royal Seed of Abraham came on the scene because Mary believed what the angel spoke to her and she said be unto me all the things that evolve around it I know no man how can this be but still be it unto me My Flesh my life my weaknesses who I am but be it unto me according to the word that I'm hearing the word that's speaking to my heart be it unto me I believe it's the same thing today Mary is conceiving a miracle marries the bride you have to plant it in your heart you can't keep it in your mind you got to put it in your heart our hearts were created by God to bring forth fruit when his words planted in them just as a seed has to remain in the ground over time to germinate sow the word of God has to abide in US Jesus said in John 15 7 if you abide if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it will be done unto you you know it's not just you know these these scriptures are not just lightly given listen to what he's saying if the seed if the word if the birth abides in you and you know it ask what you want what do you think he said that for what do you think he said speak to this mountain and don't doubt in your heart and it will be removed it's not base and in in in James people you know we pray we pray James says you ask a miss you ask according to your flesh your fleshly desires but when he speak in the word of God and he's telling you to speak and ask he knows it's not you it's the attribute it's him inside of you speaking and asking what it has need of there's a word in us that needs to grow to be watered to come into full maturity to take over this flesh it speaks to us inside it reveals to us inside what we have need of and when it does that's when we ask and that's when we speak and then that's when you see the answers oh yeah we live too much too much by this denominational system this this this this carnal system that we're out here of religion but this ain't religion this is a supernatural Living Word of God it's the living life that he wants to possess in his vessels who are his vessels I don't know but he knows amen what would happen if you plant a seed in your garden and then you dig it up each morning to see what is what is happening it would die it'll never produce fruit you have to have faith that the seed is doing what God created to do did he not say I have started to work I will finish it I am the author and I am the finisher of your faith we need to trust more we need to rest more we need to walk in his spirit and confidence more and his ability when we don't trust when we don't believe when we worry we doubt or we get self-pity upon us we get depressed all these things is because we don't believe and we don't trust in him that he's more than able to do what he said did he ever give you a timeline when he reveals something to you no Abraham you're going to have a son by Sarah and you're going to be a father of many nations Abraham's like praise God just like when he said Abraham go separate yourself from your family because they're unbelievers and they'll have you in the same frame of thinking in mind you'll go by their interpretations you'll go by their thoughts and their opinions come come and walk with me Abraham and be thou perfect when you walk with God you are perfect because you're walking with the perfect one but God never told Abraham it was going to be easy God never told Abraham how long but God told them you're going to have a son you're going to have a land and your seed will sojourn amen and I will deliver and I will set free and I will multiply and did he yes he did God said are you going to send a prophet to us in the last days did he he did the seed is the source of the origin or beginning of anything in the Book of Genesis it tells us see time Harvest principle will remain as long as the Earth does the law of sown and reaping Jesus applied this sea time Harvest principle to the word produced in the Kingdom in Mark 4 26. the spirit through the Apostle Paul applied sea time and harvest principle to giving and sowing of money second Corinthians 9 6 and to our actions and behaviors Galatians 6 7 the truth that is there all are all kinds of things called seed and all kinds of fields to sow in into we can reap a harvest out of what he's saying here we can sow because that's the law of God and we cannot change the law of God as long as the Earth stands what you sow you reap so whatever you're sown into you're going to reap in that field if you're sown to your flesh you're going to reap to your flesh your soul to the carnal mind you're going to reap the carnal mind which is death you show to the spiritual mind you're going to reap the spiritual mind which is life it's up to you it's your choice you have been given free more agency God has left you alone he's let the Earth alone to make their own choices this morning to what you will sow what you will believe and receive from his word if you lack wisdom you lack understanding ask God open my eyes There's a Great Awakening a great move happening a secret catching away in individuals happening that they cannot explain listen it's not going to be explained to you it's not going to be laid out to you by men no preacher no no sermon is going to tell you this that secret catching away in only he himself only he himself can tell you that's between you and him individually it will show where your faith is at it will show where your heart is at the angel Messner came in our day and sold seeds to the bride the spoken word of God is the Original Seed out of the mouth of a true prophet there came seeds of perfect faith of rapture and revelation of overcoming power to change everything in her soul and to awaken the seed of God to the power to live this word The Awakening of the Bride is the Harvest coming into maturity this is Harvest Time and the Harvest time is the bride coming into our maturity there is going to be a real bride there is going to be a bread that will stand on this Earth that will Manifest this word why because it's been spoken it's been spoken through a prophet it's thus say it the Lord just like California is going to go under is thus saith the Lord even now they're starting to say after all these years we had a prophet way back there said that California is going to break off and slip into the ocean now I just read and listened to a program that now the scientists are saying that California could break off and slip in the ocean never in all these years have they said that I don't eat them I don't need them out there I don't need to trust in them oh my if you're still trusting in them out there the political world the medical world the financial world God help you because it's going one place it's going right into tribulation amen God's intention was when he spoke the word that it would become materialized and made flesh within humans his chosen ones there is nothing that God hasn't spoken that stays dormant but the scripture says in Isaiah 55 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it will it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it his word has already gone forth it's already been spoken out of his mouth we are speaking what he's already spoken amen the seals have been opened you know when a seal is sealed that means it's a finished work that's why Jesus on the cross said it is finished and when all the seals were sealed is because there was a finished work behind those seals and in this day amen in this day the seventh seal was opened by the Lamb of God and when he opened those seals that finished work came forth and was spoken there are finished work here this morning there are Finnish people here this morning that the work has already been done and finished all over brother Tim I don't understand I don't come into the realization of that you will you will it's happening amnesia's break in The Awakening is taking place upon us it's happening as you believe the word the word oh my do you see why it has to be said over and over and over I can even still feel it in here you're not catching it some are not catching it but God will speak it over and over when you are ready to catch it amen you might be fighting up let me tell you if you're a son and daughter of God you know you're only going to fight up so much because God is going to deal with you why because you got to catch it amen you gotta catch this this is Rapture in Revelation Rapture and faith we gotta leave here we see out there gross Darkness we see prophecies being fulfilled third world war right on the brink tribulation setting up they're getting themselves in in gear and getting themselves in order and so is the bride who am I Hallelujah whatever God has to do it's not in my notes but whatever God has to do if he has to break you he'll break it oh my because my word will not return to me void oh thank you Jesus I look at that I say thank you Lord oh my the attribute is separating from the flesh so much there's such a like Paul said the wicked man this who's going to save me but he caught a revelation amen he said I fought the good fight or fight what a good fight the fight inside of him amen between the Flesh and the attribute the seed the faith that had to come to his Perfection inside of him that he had to manifest the word first day and fulfill and I fought that good fight and I I finished my course I kept the faith oh my I kept the revelation of God of who he said I am and now there's a crown waiting for me I know there's a crown awaiting for me I can see heaven like P like uh uh Stephen said I see the heavens open I see him sitting at the right hand of God well these are just words oh Hallelujah glory to God thank you Lord amen First Peter 1 23 being born again not of corruptable seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever God's word is alive God's seed contains life the sower Souls the word and the seed is the word it contains power it contains life that's what's inside of me that's what's inside of you if you believe if it's been revealed to you so why don't we just put aside I know it's easier said than done put aside and let him oh my words are seeds you can sow bad or good words into your relationships thoughts are seeds you can allow good or bad thoughts to be sown in your mind it's all part of the process here and you're going to hear it over and over actions attitudes and behaviors are seeds love is a seed kindness is a seed Mercy is a seed patient is a seed thankfulness is a seed even a smile is a seed even your worship is a seed just this give somebody a smile you're sown a seed oh my money is a seed you know that money is a seed that's the way I look at it when I pay my tithes and my offerings and that I don't pay it to a man I don't pay it to I pay it to God it's a seed it's the seed that I'm sowing and I approach God with that seed and I said Lord I'm approaching this seed into good ground believing that you're gonna open up the windows of Heaven part of blessing let him interpret the blessing I don't interpret it God knows what's best for my life like you said in a high call if he wants to supply my needs day to day then I'm okay with that that's that's my windows of Heaven opening up and blessing me you know there's coming a time like brother Danny's preaching the great squeeze is on there's coming a time financially this digital system Catholic Society is coming into effect is part of the new world order the mark of the beast is coming and it's going to control oh yes I'm not trying to put fear in you I'm trying to show you that this is reality that's trying to put Faith inside of you that your supply doesn't come from them it comes from God Supply it your needs every day out of his Treasures in Heaven he took the Raven and fed the prophet he took the barrel of oil and he kept filling it up over and over is he the same God today he's not just yesterday but he's today and he's going to be forever the same God Hallelujah my Lord I got to get into my message here I'm not even into it yet before I lose my voice but whatever God's will is God's word is powerful it's a sword it's a two-edged sword now remember when I am speaking this remember the word of God is a seed the seed is the attribute and where is the attribute it's inside of you so this word is a sword inside of you is cutting like a two-edged sword it's Discerning the very thoughts and intents of your heart it's all back to you and your walk that word convicts you the same word that saves you everything God can do in his word he can do because he is the one the word God's word prevails you see it prevails where in you there's something you can overcome no maybe you haven't overcome it yet because you're praying for the faith to become stronger and clearer so that you can walk out like the enemy comes in as a flood unbelief comes in as a flood in an area of your life that you're battling and that you're struggling with but then God comes with Revelation and raises a standard and causes you to live make his word inside of you more real so the word is more real than that that flood that's how you overcome that's what's in a seed inside of you it prevails we always look into ourselves we're always looking to our own abilities what man can do as soon as you realize and recognize it has nothing to do with you this walk this battle this overcoming has nothing to do with you he said I have already overcome I have finished the work it's him inside of me that is overcoming not me people still get confused with the process of sowing a seed and believing really what can you believe you say you believe what do you believe you can't believe you're just saying it it's a mental Faith you're just saying it that you believe you can't believe unless something is revealed to you when it's revealed to you by him the word who you are then you can believe you can't even believe what's being spoken here this morning that this pertains to you unless it's revealed to you Hallelujah God's word prevails over everything not just some things okay I don't I come to a place in my walk I don't care I don't care anymore about anything but the word of God if it says it prevails over everything so no matter what comes in my life what struggle I have it's going to Prevail over it it's going to conquer it amen Hallelujah Hallelujah God's word is powerful or you can say the seed the attribute is full of power it's not weak it's not crippled but it's full of power I'm talking about you and your walk and what you're believing what you got inside of you is full of power so when you're approaching the throne when you're approaching a circumstance a situation take the full power of the word of God that's inside of you in prayer and speak the word of God who am I it has power to heal not only physically but emotionally mentally spiritually he sent his word he already sent his word out now it's germanizing hearts in good ground this morning in the bride he sent his word and he healed and he's healing and he's continued to deliver and it's overcoming oh my foreign Hallelujah Hebrews 1 3. the word of God says his powers over all nature because God's word created nature we look in Genesis and we see that God spoke let there be let there be the great creation came into effect right but then Jesus spoke to the wind and the Sea and they obeyed the word they obeyed him what was God doing what was God showing he was saying I'm not just back there when I spoke and said let there be let there be but I'm here now in flesh and I'm showing you that the God who created nature is control in nature and the god who's control in nature and speak into nature and it's obeying him is inside of you in a form of an attribute a seed of God growing by faith into perfect Faith every day you know other is coming to a place in in in now in this time it's coming to a place where that door is shutting we're saying it over and over and the and the Revelation the revealing of the word the third pull is being spoken and it's creating life into the Bride of Jesus Christ those those those grounds those hearts that are prepared and wanted that there could be somebody sitting here or ending church for 30 40 years not wanting it and a soul comes in at the last minute and the ground is good it's toiled up is is God has dealt with it and it's good ground and it wants it remember the third pull is going to go to them and the Bride of Jesus Christ and bring her to perfect faith and perfect Rapture Revelation but it's also going to preach to the loss when he cursed the fig tree it died curse those things in your life curse the things that are tormenting you curse the devil bind the devil in your life don't worry about binding the devil and everybody else's life bind them in your life get to enough faith that you can bind them in your own life and see that and then maybe God will allow you to bind him in somebody else's life oh we want to bind the devil all over the place but we can't even control the devil in our own life in our flesh devil speaking manifesting acting through flesh and we want to bind them that's nothing but a religious demon from the pits of hell manifesting all physical laws obey spiritual laws because the spiritual law was first you understand that all natural laws fleshly laws natural things in your life has to obey the spiritual law the spiritual revelation of the word of God in you God's word has power to call things into being he called Abraham a nation he called Peter steadfast he called the world into being while he also called us healed he called us more than conquerors he has called us a glorious church he has called us a royal priesthood a friend of God and he's called this world to destruction you understand he has the power to call into existence what he has spoken and he's already called a bride he's called a race a royal priesthood unto God he's called individuals in these last days oh my now God's word is powerful not only to give life but also to deliver warnings bring judgment and Punishment punishment to the disobedient is not my word like fire declares the Lord and like a hammer that breaks the Rock in pieces Jeremiah 23 29. God's living word is not something to read or listen to passively and then forget James taught Christians to look intently into the perfect law that gives us freedom and to focus on doing what it says not just a hearer but a doer how many people walk out of these doors every week amen and become a doer of what they hear I hope everybody James 1 23 Paul told Timothy all scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is the truth and to make us realize what's wrong in our lives it corrects us when we are wrong it teaches us to do what is right God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work second Timothy 3 16 if we let God's message of this hour do its work deep within us it will change our character it will change our Behavior it will change our thinking it will change everything about us Because He Lives you shall live also because the same quick and Empower just think about it as much as you can the same quickening power that raised the dead body out of the grave in three days is inside of you you see what I'm saying here you see what I'm saying it's if it gets through you won't be able to sit in your seats you won't be able to sit in your seats if it gets through I'm trying to contain myself but if if I don't then you don't have to forgive me because I'm just going to have a good time dancing in the Lord because I'm seeing something very wonderful up here that's changing my life it's changing everything about me is bringing me into a place that I'm recognizing who I am perfect realization now you know what that means hey I'm just getting started Hallelujah thank you thank you Lord the power of God's message has the ability to pierce penetrate the innermost depths of the human soul it can cut through any obstacle to access and inspect our unspoken thoughts and hidden secrets Matthew 10 26 Luke 8 17 marked 4 22 and it can cross-examine and judge the attitudes of our hearts thank you that's what it does is it doing that in you amen I got an answer I got one response yes Hallelujah you know one soul is more than worth more than ten thousand worlds I that's all that matters amen Hallelujah Jesus said I have already conquered do not fear anymore Jesus said I have already conquered do not fear anymore the greatest plague on this earth now the greatest plague that plagues believers do not fear anymore I've already conquered do not fear in your life anymore I've already conquered do not fear the situations that you're in the circumstances that you're in the trouble that you're in anymore I've already conquered it's the seed it's the attribute I'm talking about this morning not any individual but him that is real that is alive that is living and flush again oh my God Jesus for every four ordained predestinated seed of God shall come to life when that light spreads across the Earth oh that glorious gospel in every age bringing forth the crop that God ordained it to do that he raised from the dead oh what a wonderful thing that is I am alive or Quicken the word quicken in the Greek word means something that is made alive after death we were dead in sin and trespasses but it's now made alive do you believe that are you alive this morning oh my Hallelujah then you will understand the word of God for your life like a seed that goes through the Earth it has to die every bit of that seed it has to rot every bit of that seed you can't mix carnality you can't mix your own interpretation you cannot mix this flesh generational Spirits culture with this word it will not mix it's the pure word seed it stands alone it has to rot in your life Paul says I Die daily you gotta die die die daily if you want to live you want to know the kingdom you're hearing it but can you do it every bit of that of the life that was in the seed has to come forth again he has quickened not only that and he will send the same life now listen that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave I will send it upon you to Quicken you that where I am you maybe also that's not just Heaven that's not just at the end of Heavens now where I am in Heavenly places where I am in this word the revelation of this word that is opening up revealing the third poll where I am I'm not in this world Jesus said I'm gonna have nothing to do with this world I have nothing to do with your flesh where am I where is he where I am walking moving and operating I will Quicken you to be there too oh Hallelujah thank you Lord now listen he come to redeem and to bring to life those predestinated seeds that God seen before the foundation of the world and put their names on the book of life and here they are on the Earth without hope wasn't that you and me he came not only to be the blessing but to share the blessing to every predestinated seed all right that's good enough for me I don't know about you if you need more evidence you need more and more now if the seed wasn't on the earth it could not live he had to be on the Earth and also germatized no matter how long it keeps in the Darkness that seed it'll come forth when the sun shines upon us notice now he come to share it with us no matter how long you were in darkness how long you were in sin you know he had to be on the Earth right what was that coming down those angels that brother Bram talked about the seven angels what was that one in the Middle with his wings spread back what did he say it was God Christ Almighty he had to come to the Earth amen he had to come his life had to come because we're not in the we're not in the stock we're not in the tussle we're we're in the seed it's in the seed of this day and only he can bring he is that seed he is the Original Seed he had to come back and germatize awaken shine his light his quickening power upon the seed in this hour because never has there been an hour never has there been a time in in in in in all of history other Church ages where he's bringing a people back to seed form not just justification not just sanctification not just the baptism and the gifts but the very life of Jesus Christ the very life of Jesus Christ well I'm not preaching religion and I don't hear I don't hear this this stuff being preached out there what are you talking about some of the things that we're saying here we we we're we're you know we we're we're growing in this and we're we're feeding us every day but listen this is not normal and I thank God because I ain't normal [Laughter] because if I'm normal you know a brother was telling me that his wife said well everybody look at you guys you're only small everybody's doing this I don't want to do what everybody's doing I want to be that single person walking the other way while everybody's walking that way that's where he's at he's always been there amen Galatians 4 28. you are the seed of God to the world around you Abraham saw you as his seed from the moment God entered into the Covenant with him Genesis 17 4 you can never know the power of the seed if you are not walking in a covenant relationship with God is that the truth about sowing and reaping your decisions to sow seed for anything in life you should never be never never should be a social decision and it always has to be a spiritual decision it has to be decided that the the triggered by your born-again spirit man inside of you what you sow in your life amen you gotta be determined you got to be uh persuaded you got to be oh God Focus I don't know what the word I'm looking for on sowing the right seeds in your life we are so sowing sometimes I'm all I'm here too I'm pointing at you with three are pointing back at me so you know just to make you feel a little bit better you know it goes back to me too I'm here to hear the word too believe it or not that's the way it works I don't want to sow it to my carnal mind I don't want to sow it to the Natural Things of this life you know what what's happening me I know there's a change taking place inside of me that things are being dropped off desires are being dropped off of my life rapidly I'm telling you listen if that's not happening to you because I believe I'm in the spirit of God I believe I'm walking with the spirit of God and in the in the movement of the Bride of Jesus Christ and in the mind of Christ and if that is happening to me I know it's happening to her each individual that's walking with God and if it's not happened to you oh God may God wake you up in this late hour Hallelujah I want that Covenant relationship more and more with him Hallelujah James 3 1 once you understand the power of your words you won't just say anything that's the problem we don't understand the power of our words we remember God gave the law sown and reaping it's to everybody what are you going to sow you're going to constantly show the carnality in your life what do you think you're reaping a harvest what do you think the atmosphere brother Brown said go and speak our world a world that you want and walk in it and live in it by what by the Spoken Word by what you speak around your life not negative not doubt not fear not unbelief you know when those times come when the enemy comes be still be still and know that he's God just don't say nothing until you can speak by the spirit do not say nothing because you're just gonna so evil upon yourself and a separation between you and God the power of soul and seeds into your marriage by speaking faith in your relationship then you can come into agreement that the word of God governs and controls your marriage in all areas you both let the word judge the situation marriage problem solves right there best marriage and counsel I can ever give you oh brother Tim this does this and that and he he does this and that that's all nonsense let the word of God sow the word of God in your marriage sow it in your relationship bring the word if I'm wrong let the word stand there and let me be wrong and let me agree with the word if she's wrong let the word judge it oh but you know my husband is a little you know High Strung or he's this way or that way or my wife a little bit this way and that way if that's where you're going to stay that's where you're going to stay doesn't matter about any of that stuff let the word of God judge let it be the one that guides and leads and speaks into your marriage into your hearts line up with the word Hallelujah amen second Corinthians okay let's try to get to some things here I'm on page seven and I got 11 pages so I'm gonna have to just skip through some stuff and continue second Corinthians 10 5 once you understand the power of your thoughts you just won't think anything second Corinthians 15 3 Once you understand the power of your presence you just won't go anywhere huh you just won't go anywheres I wonder I wonder sometimes where we go what kind of atmospheres we go in what kind of places we go to maybe you're like Legion that you know walks around the dead in the tombs the deadness of this world and you need Jesus to come to cast those demons out of you because the areas and places that you go things that you speak atmospheres that you're picking up influences that are influencing you is not the word of God all I can say if you're a child of God God is going to deal with you if you're not you're just going to mingle on that stuff and you're just going to fall right into that stuff I want to go where the spirit of God leads me Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God he can lead you he can guide you and he ain't going to go and lead you anywhere is where he's not Lord David said if you don't go up before me don't let me go the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the lord they're blessed coming in and going out because he's leading us we wake up in the morning great spirit of the Living God that lives inside of me lead me and guide me today go before me remove every trap every snare every hinders of the devil that's that he has set for me and break the power of Satan every morning I say that because I realize what I'm in here I'm in a battle I'm in a fight I don't see with these eyes that see these Natural Things there's a spiritual warfare going on demons trying to to snatch people's Souls he knows his time is short but you need to know who you are and that's what God is doing opening up your understanding breaking the spiritual amnesia oh when she realizes we're going to get to it not that you haven't heard it before you're going to hear it again and again until it becomes real why go on behind the veil is not a one-time event or experience it's a lifestyle settle it forever settle it forever what you want to do you commit yourself to God he'll commit himself to you if you're not committed that's the worst torment though you realize that you're you're standing between the dimensions even here this morning you're standing in between Dimensions when you if you're not surrendered to the word of God I don't care how perfect you are in your flesh but if you are in your heart you're surrendered to the word of God then you are in a dimension where the spirit of God is but if you're not and you're coming to church and you're just playing church and religion you're trapped in a dimension between hell and heaven this morning because you haven't settled it with God you haven't got to a place where you've given up everything for God and your own life you haven't died to your own life your own ways and said Lord I surrender all that I know all that I can I surrender to you at least you can say Lord I don't understand but help me this age is so dark so wicked so lukewarm lazy lazy in the mind people don't want to press in people don't want to get desperate that's another part I'm going to do don't want to get desperate but the seed of God gets desperate it's desperate every day amen it's perseverance every day it doesn't take a day off it doesn't relax or be lazy it's gonna it's got a mission it's got a purpose to fulfill the seed of God and every day it's their moving God don't sleep or you don't slumber where is God he's in Me's in you he don't sleep or Slumber even when you're waking up sometimes that's why you wake up at two or three in the morning you don't understand because it's the word of God inside of you trying to speak to you it's moving it's working it's fulfilling our carnal mind don't understand but that's what's going on that's what's going on be still in those times maybe he'll speak to you if not you say Lord let it be done unto me according to the work that you're doing right now oh my this means whatever occurs in your life from that point on is the result of decisions that you make from the heart not from the flesh the wealth of his presence Beyond the Veil your spirit becomes more alive than you can ever dream possible that's what it is for it is the response to the Creator The Depths and Heights are unsearchable the life is changed forever are you hearing me yet it is just beginning to change at the same time you begin to understand in a small way what David in the Psalms was acknowledging when he said you hide me in a secret place of your presence Hallelujah and from the plots of men Psalms 31 20. it means Total Protection my brothers and sisters behind that Veil behind that place behind the blood sickness is not allowed there enemies cannot enter there oh they enter in on the outside but inside all is well in my with My Soul all is well inside of that secret pardon place they can't enter there it can't go there Only The unsearchable Riches of God are there oh you say I believe tap into it tap into it it'll change your life it'll bring the presence of God in your life it'll bring change in areas it'll produce Miracles inside of you now you never thought possible things that will change that you thought will never change and fall off it will fall off oh God seek knock don't stop take the kingdom of God with violence press your way in press your way in oh God in the name of Jesus Hallelujah the spirit of the Living God hallelujah thank you Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah daily spiritual
