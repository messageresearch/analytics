in your hearts tonight amen getting a bit of a ring praise the Lord I spoke to Pastor Simon just a little while ago and he sends his greetings he will not be here this evening he says the winds are quite active he doesn't feel like coming over the bridge so he'll be listening in from home also brother Glenn letting us know that he'll be staying home with his mother keep her in prayer you know as she's aging and feeling the pressure and brother Glenn of course is feeling a lot of pressure too so we certainly want to keep them in prayer so first of all I like to say that I want to thank everybody for the nomination sister Jennifer and I uh you know are quite um surprised that uh this change is coming upon us uh we realized though that everything has a time and a season by the grace of God we also realize the amount of change that it will require should it be the Lord's will for us to be placed in that position it's going to take a tremendous amount of change in our lives but we also know that we're dealing with a living God that is more than able to do whatever he needs to have done in our lives I'm sure brother Tim and sister Deborah are quite aware of that also um we are by the grace of God willing to submit and allow the Holy Spirit to have his perfect will in our lives that's the only desire that we have we realize it's a it's a place of great responsibility and so we cannot take it lightly we take it very very serious and so we covet your prayers and trust that the Lord will have his way and I know that he's going to work everything out and it'll all work together for good because we love the Lord amen praise God we'll also be praying for you brother at the end of the service okay and so let's just go to prayer before we go to this uh to the word of God Amen father we're so grateful tonight that we as human beings can come into your awesome presence where all things are possible to them that believe and tonight Lord we come bringing your word reading your word reading the quotes of our precious prophet Lord but it's going to take your spirit to give it life and to minister to our hearts our needs Lord we realize the supernatural element of your calling upon each and every one of our lives we rely upon your instruction and your faith and we know that Faith cometh by hearing the word of God and so tonight we welcome you great spirit to take control anoint hearer and speaker and may you receive all the praise the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen praise God so we're going to continue um we uh we we ministered a message back on January the 4th I believe it was um on The Squeeze in this hour and so tonight we want to continue with that um there's there's so much that that we can draw from the scriptures and from the quotes that we'll be reading tonight um let us go to the scripture Hebrews chapter 11. verses 36 to 40. and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings Yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were Sana Sunder were tempted we're slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy why because these were attributes of God these were the sons and daughters of God that had come down to the Earth in order to fulfill the purpose and the plan of God and God needed vessels that he could possess that he could anoint that he could prove to the world that he was a living God Amen praise God they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the Earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith by revelation receive not the promise so there was something that God was building up that God was doing condescending down and bringing each and every one of these attributes of God each and every one of these individuals for a great purpose and here we are in the last days culminating all of this allowing the Holy Spirit now to minister to us and through us to bring the word that will take us in the rapture because the promise is the rapture for us that's the promise the great meeting in the air they which are are dead shall be raised up first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with who with all of them so that we can rejoice and have that meeting that Plan of Redemption to be fulfilled but notice here God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect praise God you may be seated we look back through the scriptures right from Genesis and we see the move of God and how God was condescending down to bring himself eventually to where he would reunite with his sons and daughters because we know that this whole plan was something that he planned from before the foundations of the world so this is one of the things that you know we we can never we can never forget that this was all part of God's plan you know I was with some friends today and uh you know we had lunch together and there was a priest and there was you know a Catholic priest and then there was you know a couple of my good friends um who I you know business associates that I love and appreciate and you know we get to talking uh on the word you know eventually it leads they lead into it and then of course I'm gonna say my part and you know they were talking about how you know one of them was talking about how the world you know like can you can go back like hundreds of thousands of years and how things you know have happened you know first for eons of time millions of years I mean the dinosaurs all the we know all those things right and then I sat back and I let them say all those things and you know and and the priest you know he's from India and you know he was talking about how you know when you really go back you know thousands of years everything really started in India right and and it's interesting because you know if you talk to certain people from different nations you know they'll give you their understanding of how it originated you know this originated all right back there in Israel if you talk to the Jews and if you talk to the Italians they'll tell you well you know a lot took place in Italy and you know so and and so I got to talking at the end and I said you know all that you're saying and everything that you're that you're bringing here it's all very possible and I don't doubt it at all because you know like for example you know the Catholic priest being from India they're you know like the world power has gone from from this country to that country and there's been a a moving of power and a transforming of power that's been going from country to Country well Hebrews chapter 11 verse 6 says that the worlds plural were formed by the word of God and so there could have been many worlds and I said but we're not in those other worlds we're in this one I said what does the word of God say for us this is what we need to be concerned about we need to be tuned in to the plan of God because I said God has given this world 7 000 years of time and and Joseph the priest says yes that's correct I said and that 7 000 years of time we're just about done 6 000 years or we're actually over if you look at the calendars but we can't put an exact time on all of that I said so what's important is to realize that God has a plan for this world we're in a world and so whenever I study the word or I Fellowship on the word I want to know the present stage of God what is he doing right now because that's what concerns me that's what concerns the world we can look at all the prophecies and all the events that are taking place in the world and We Know by fact when we look into the word of God we see that we're in the last days we see the prophecies that were written in the Lamb's Book of Life being manifested in our lives because we are hearkening to the call of God in this day you see we need to recognize where we fit into the now I didn't get into all this of course all I said was we need to recognize what it is that God is doing in our day and how it pertains to us because we know that the world is going to get worse and they said oh yeah they see that the you know the conditions of the world we're in the midst of of a World War potential three right now and you know and Joseph the priest he says something significant is going to happen in March next month that could trigger and send us into World War III I said that's very possible in my mind I'm saying I'm fully prepared I understand that these prophecies are going to take place I realize the hour that we're living in and I'm I'm just blessed that God has allowed us to be a part of it I'm just thankful that the Lord has given us faith and Revelation to recognize what it is that we must do as Sons and Daughters of God to overcome the pressure that's coming down in this age let's go to the next slide when I finished off in uh uh in January on this on the 4th of January I finished off with this quote and I want to read it again from Christ The Mystery of God Christ is the mystery 1963 oh the devil's howling about this the manifested truth of the promise of the word in her alone now listen we did not deserve any thing special we were born into this world born in sin shaped in iniquity speaking lies we're no better than anybody else but God when he says my sheep hear my voice that's something that we have no control over when I heard this message and I recognized his voice because it was his voice that I recognized I didn't recognize brother Branham I didn't I didn't know who brother Branham was but when he started to deal and pull upon my heart by the word of God there was something in me that could respond and identify and recognize and it brought a power now we're going to be looking at this this is only we're we're just we're just going to touch the surface but as we move into this series you're going to see things that that because I want to bring the word in such a way that even the little children can understand it that when we come to realize that when we receive Faith by the word of God and it's meant for you to receive it you're one of the sheep my sheep my chosen ones not one of them will be lost all that the father hath given me will come he didn't say might he said we'll come doesn't matter where they are it doesn't matter how young how old when the word of faith drops into their hearts it brings a power into your life individually to overcome whatever it is that you're dealing with in your life so if you're a young child and you're in school and your mother's bringing you here into the house of the Lord to receive the word of God and you're meeting certain challenges because there's bullies at church or there or at uh at school and there's you know situations in the in the school I'm using an example for our young people you know you might have a job or you might have a boss that you don't like or that's nasty or whatever when you come into the house of the Lord and you receive the word for your day remember the word for your day is Christ speaking and ministering to each and every one of us including the minister and when that word gets accepted into your heart that's why Jesus said only believe only believe all things are possible a power a strength and the spirit of God comes into your life and you even unconscious will start to be delivered from those situations that are around your life that's why Jesus said seek first the kingdom everything else will be added we want to keep it simple we want to be able to recognize that faith will come in due season and to each and every one of us is given a portion of faith we cannot all be the same God has a many-membered body but the body is designed in such a way that it edifies itself your body is designed in such a way that when you get sick it starts to work from the inside to push that sickness out while the Holy Spirit when he comes in you and you receive the word of God it starts to deal with the sickness the oppression the chains of the enemy the things that are holding you that are oppressing you that are keeping you down to be cast out to be broken and for you to be liberated by the spirit of God and so Satan doesn't like that he doesn't understand it because revelation is something that is sovereign it's only given if God decides to give it he can't receive it all he can do is fight it that's why when we look back at all those that had to go through the things that they went through they were given an anointing listen Abraham Abraham was a pagan of all pagans he was sacrificing children they were they were Idol worshipers but when the spirit of the Lord came and spoke to him he heard that voice something came into him that gave him the power to overcome all of his Kindred Folk everything that was that that that had a hold on him that had held him by tradition all the the the influences of his family of his children God says get up and go that's all he that's all he gave him he had to overcome all the testings that came with get up and go I remember when God called my life and my family and and I realized my God how am I gonna you know get rid of all this unbelief around my life because you you come to realize that when the word of God comes to you all you can see is is unbelief everybody around you your own family your friends everybody's cursing and swearing and taking the name of the Lord in vain and it's like you know stealing and cheating and this it was just a part of life but all I can say to you is that God put Faith into my heart and it overcame and here we are 30 years later believing this word like never before because we know that the way that he started that work is how he's going to finish it and take us right out of here so the word in her alone they don't have the answer when Jesus come why didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils by the Finger of God who do you cast them out by they had no idea they thought they knew God they thought they understood the word but then when the word stood right there in front of them just like us they you know we didn't realize we thought that the priest knew the word we figured oh well if we need to know anything about God we should go talk to the priest they should know but then God gives you a simple Revelation on the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and you talk to the first person that you talk to and you find out that 98 of the world believes in the trinity that there's three in one and you're sitting there you can see as clear as a bell that Jesus Christ was the word made flesh he was God Emmanuel God With Us the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us in the beginning was the word so if the word was in the beginning and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Then Jesus Christ was God it's as simple as that but it goes right over their head and you're sitting there and going wow how is it because my sheep hear my voice he stood alone and you've got to stand alone as a young person as an old person Wherever You Are you don't have to be a person that stands alone and makes everybody know that you know and that they don't know you know by the grace of God but where you stand alone is in your faith that you can't disbelieve the word when you see unbelief you can't believe unbelief because your attribute your your your representation in the word cannot deny the word and so you see the word clear and his church stands alone she's not hooked with nothing but he was identified by guys talk Jesus was identified by God being the body that God dwelt in and the church is identified by his body doing the same thing she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it you're a minority it's just the way it is that's why the devil is howling these great organizations set up something to close her up they'll never do it she'll be taken up not closed up so next slide we come to realize that you know you can go back and you know listen we could talk about so many of the the the Warriors and the and the uh the true Sons and Daughters of God that God chose all through the Old Testament we think about David we think about uh yeah it Rahab there's there's so many types and so many you know Shadows there that that we can look at and and all we can see is when we read about them we see that Faith had to come for them to overcome look at David was you know when when God sent Samuel into into David's house you know and it's called the father and says I need to find the king he's here he's one of your sons God didn't choose the ones that they thought God chose David I got a son you know you got to have one more he says I got one that's out in the field he's always you know hanging out with the Sheep he stinks you know surely it can't be him bring him and when he came that was God's choice and God poured oil all over him because it was a sign that the spirit of God was going to come upon his life and that he would be the one he would be the one that would lead Israel he would be the king of Israel and when he stood in front of Goliath he had already had experiences with God he knew that God could deliver him and you need to think and and put yourself into that position today because I know that many of you have been walking with the Lord for many many years and you've got goliaths in your life but I want you to look back at what God did for you that brought you thus far David remembered he says one one time a lion came and tried to take one of my sheep and I I destroyed that sheep he killed the sheep and then another time a bear came and tried and I killed that bear why he had an experience with God he knew what was possible with God and so you should know that there's nothing impossible amen whatever circumstance whatever situation you're dealing with in your life right now you need to believe that that same God that delivered you that called you and brought you thus far will take you the rest of the way you will need to overcome David stood there in front of the king of Israel and looked at that Goliath who stood about 10 feet tall a lot of people they thought there's just no way we can kill this giant but David Knew by experience he wasn't coming he says you come with your own strength you come with your own ability but I'm coming in the name of the Lord and he stood before that Goliath and he said today with your sword I'm going to take your head off and he did it but here we are recognizing that God was condescending God was showing through all of those attributes of God that he was going to fulfill his promise that he was going to get to the end of the road and that every son and daughter of God would be redeemed back to where we came from so here we know God sent us a prophet thank God that the prophet of God came thank God that he brought his message without his message we could not be where we are today but we need to also realize that it was the voice of God the voice of God not the voice of William Branham so when they rejected brother Branham they were rejecting the word and the pressure was coming down imagine brother Branham all those years you know you know I'll read some quotes he says here and that's the way of the world today it's got plenty to eat plenty to wear find churches big places fine educated ministers and so they don't need nothing but you don't know that the scripture said you're naked miserable blind and don't know it don't know it and you can't tell them no different they continually weighed right on down that line and failed to let the word of God influence them to believe Jesus Christ is raised from the dead and alive today the same yesterday today and forever they're just simply dead brother Branham came and brought a word that was rejected he brought a word that brought all of the churches into the second crucifixion and they were indicted for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ because they had rejected the word and it was because he had brought the word no matter what nation you're in wherever you're at whoever you are let it wake you up hours come and go the first thing you know you'll be saying well I thought they were supposed to be this happened before the rapture there might be a voice come back like it did one time it's already happened and you didn't know it you'll be all anchored off in church somewhere saying I'm just as secure as I can be and the first thing you know the Rapture will be gone I'm going to it's going to be a secret sudden going nobody know nothing about it look the world will keep right on going like Noah went into the ark you remember after Noah went into the ark he sat there seven days after God closed the door God closed the door and Noah sat in the ARK for seven days before anything happened and the door of Mercy will be closed in your face and might already be and just thinking of it the people go right ahead preaching people thinking they're getting saved putting their names on the books joining churches shouting jumping up and down that's from the message influence 1964. so brother Branham we know that in 1906 brother Branham was born and that was the beginning of the last Church age 50 years later brother Branham was was approaching his Jubilee he was 50 years old and he said that his message would either be accepted or rejected amen the religious systems had recognized and witnessed brother branham's Ministry and they were all happy to bring him in when he had the first sign which was the first pull was the sign on the hand the second sign was the discernment of their spirits of their of their conditions they'd be able to tell them the you know the secrets of their hearts and everybody was opening the doors and walking him in he would have meeting after meeting he went across the world seven times and and people that the crowds were in the thousands sometimes tens of thousands would go to his meetings but yet in 1963 there was a dispensational change that took place and this was a a very significant time for the church it was the time where God was going to now change a dispensation and go from a man on the Earth to the mighty Angel come down and manifest himself in the five-fold ministry to call all those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life there came the opening of the word that's what that was in 1963 when brother Branham started to minister on those Seven Seals it was God coming down to release the Mysteries that were in the word of God and and those Mysteries are sitting here tonight because he came and he was the lamb that could was the only one that could take the book there was nobody else that was able to take the book that was sealed with Seven Seals that's why for people to say oh brother Branham opened the Seven Seals no he didn't it was the lamb that opened the Seven Seals no man was found worthy in heaven or on Earth only the bleeding lamb after he had done the sacrifice because everything was fulfilled from before the foundations of the world and so we need to recognize when this dispensational change took place it sent the whole religious world into a chaos all of a sudden all the doors started to shut down to brother Branham and to his message because now it was like Jesus Christ when he you go back and you read Saint John chapter 6 you know start at verse 26 and go right through right down into verse 66 where it says they walked with him no more because he was unveiling himself before the people he was making himself known before the people that was his seventh seal Revelation before the people that was his third pull Ministry amongst the people and he was telling them if you don't eat my word and if you don't drink my blood if you don't receive the spirit of God there's you will have no part of me and it was hard for them to accept that and when brother Branham was preaching on the opening of the word and and the Seven Seals and was was exposing the power of the enemy Satan everybody thought the white horse rider was Christ meanwhile it was that Deceiver that was moving in the churches constantly trying to squeeze the word out of the people to get them to disbelieve God's word remember God doesn't change and Satan doesn't change his ways are the same and so here in later in 63 brother Branham after he realized that he had been rejected he realized what took place there in Revelations 10 1-7 when God said that he put his foot on the right hand on on the scene on the land and he said time shall be no more he realized that the time had run out now we know that the Angel and the dispensational change of the messenger went from an Earthly time Messenger to an eternal messenger which is Christ now in the five-fold ministry but we also need to see the types and the shadows and the and the and the physical applications of the word that took place in 1963 when he said time shall be no more and then he goes on to be rejected and then he goes on to preach a message I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Jesus Christ I can show you quotes in the word I'm going to read some of them here where where brother Branham talks about uh that you know that they basically had rejected the word of God and that their time had basically run out as a nation as Nations as denominations God is not dealing with denominations anymore God's not dealing with with countries anymore God sent you know uh Moses into Egypt because God was bringing judgment onto Egypt but God is now dealing with you and I individually calling each and every one of us into our position as Sons and Daughters of God listen to brother Branham here recognizing your day 1964 down in your heart you feel the Holy Spirit dropping tears Jerusalem Old Jerusalem how oft would I have hovered you but what did you do you killed the prophets that I sent to you you murdered them and the messages has been sent to the churches today has been murdered foreign dogmas scripture has been murdered by their dogmas Jesus said if you'd only knowed your day but it's too far now it's too late now so it's so it is with the churches they accept it and they're going to accept the World Council of churches when Jesus was on the Earth and they brought Jesus up to be judged for crucifixion they took a murderer by the name of Barabbas instead of accepting the word of God so what they're going to do is they're going to develop and are have already developed the World Council of churches and their purpose is only one thing and that is to try and snuff out the true word of God they're accepting a system listen to brother Brown what shall we do with Jesus 1963 he says and what if the churches desired a murderer of the word one who takes a system if the system is contrary to the word then it's a murderer to the word and they desired a denominational tradition instead of the true word being manifested and proved that it's God amongst the People by science through pictures light the same Angel of the Lord the pillar of Fire that was God vindicating to the people in that day when that Supernatural was taking place all around brother branham's life it was God vindicating and saying here I am but his sheep heard my sheep will hear same thing's taking place today we're going to lead into how it is that God is speaking to us and how the squeeze is actually good for us because it's going to produce the word when they crucified Christ and they sent them to the Cross they thought that they had gotten rid of him no they didn't they allowed a multiplied form of many Christ's Sons and Daughters of God to come back on the earth and be filled with his Spirit to overcome and fulfill the Plan of Redemption that's what we're doing we need to keep that as a center focal point of Our Lives you see the reason why we preach this message and we Minister on this revelation on the present stage of the ministry of Jesus Christ is so that the last one that's to come in because he said all that the father hath given me will come not one will be lost those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life from before that all the names are written there that's why when the lamb took the book and he started to unveil the Mysteries as the Mysteries were being unveiled and you know I remember I remember when I first read the seven seal book I started reading that book I could not put it down I was eating it up like it was like food it I was getting so much stimulation I encourage you to go back and read that again after this series is done because that's where I'm drawing a lot of the information and a lot of the inspiration is coming right out of that because that pertains to us we need to recognize our day and the message that's come for our day and the message came and started in 1963 and it pertained to you and me that even Rhymes 1963 pertains to you and me Hallelujah when you hear those Mysteries being preached you're hearing your name being called you're recognizing the word and it's it's positionally placing you into a position of perfect Faith to recognize that the word is being fulfilled in my life in your life that you're actually one of God's attributes but it's going to be rejected it's not going to be accepted easily the language we speak is like a foreign language to most people but revelation when God gives you the understanding you can't you can't explain it you just understand it you see it as clear as clear can be in recognizing your day here 1964 and just remember if time no sorry 19 yeah recognize it National Force put Israel in her Homeland National Force put the church in the world Council of churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride remember Faith cometh by hearing remember what we were saying and remember this message is the only message that pulls the Sons and Daughters of God into the body of Christ we're going to be looking at a lot down the road here I've got a lot of notes there's no way we can cover it tonight but we're going to be looking at the first pull the second pull the third pull and the effect of the third pull and why it's so powerful in in in your life right now you're gonna you're gonna see things that you never saw before you're going to realize that you are truly an overcomer God's power is what puts the people in The Bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God my spirit my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in Christ will put her in her place no National Force will do it but the National Force will drive Israel to the Homeland it was National forces God used National forces to force Israel back into her Homeland because we know that the next stage that when the Rapture does take place and the bride is removed from this Earth God's attributes are taken then everything focuses back on to Israel and the Holy Spirit is going to send his Messengers Moses and Elijah into Israel and they're going to be preaching the same Revelation that we are preaching here tonight they're going to preach the revelation of Jesus Christ they're gonna they're gonna realize that they actually had their visitation of Messiah but it wasn't their time it was our time that the Gentiles should be spoken to should be called Hallelujah and so he'll put her in her plate no National Force will do it but the National Force put Israel in her home the National Force forces of the Council of the churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it and just remember if time moves on we're not going to have this privilege very long this is you know here brother Branham was speaking back in 1964 about you know the Rapture he thought would happen that night next week he was under full expectation that there was nothing left that had to be done why because he had fulfilled his portion of the word he had come into perfect faith and revelation of what it was that God had given him in the scripture to fulfill and that's why he never you don't you you can go back you never really ever hear Brother Branham talking about Revelations 10 8 to 11. where it talks about us taking the book and eating the book and prophesying again because that was the continuation of the word to bring us into this dispensation we've we've preached on on that many times on calling the resurrection that the bride now has the word she prophesies but she's not repeating the same things that have already been said those names that were called under brother branham's dispensation were called under his dispensation and the bride and the attributes of God that were under his dispensation recognized heard the word and came well there's a new dispensation and now we carry the prophecy which is Christ in us to speak and to call the resurrection of the Saints right out of whatever condition that they're in not our voice but the scripture and brother Brown said she'll have the final voice the final voice will be in the bride his voice not your voice not my voice we can get excited sometimes and we we look at situations and we want to just in the name of Jesus Christ let this lottery ticket win this Friday night it keeps falling because it reminds me I need a drink it's not applying the word in that way it's recognizing that the voice is in the bride and that unconsciously things will happen listen to brother Brown he says now just remember if time moves on another 10 minutes if time moves on we're not going to have this privilege very long see remember something will take place either the law will stop us or Satan will move among you and Scatter you well guess what the law didn't stop brother Branham or his people but Satan moved in amongst us because that's what the scripture said he would do and to do what scatter Force get you to disbelieve the word of God he's your enemy he's going to constantly try to bombard you with unbelief now these things has got to come to pass in this day just as he promised that he would do it listen identified Christ of all ages the presence of Jesus Christ which ought to illuminate the church to know that in this last days where Creeds and denominations and isms and everything has got the word all smothered out and Jesus the word on the outside of the church remember in laodicea he was knocking because he was put out of the church but it was for individuals now to invite him in it's not churches anymore it's the individuals that are maybe caught up in some of these churches like some of us were in the last days and he come back among the people and identified himself as he promised in the last days when the son of man is being revealed he was revealed in the baptism he was revealed in Divine Healing and he is in his last attribute in his last now there's many attributes but the last attribute is the body of Christ is the eve the restoration of Eve you know in type form he's here he was remember that was the last thing that Abraham saw before fire fell and judged the Gentile world and before the promised son came on the scene Isaac this is the last thing that the Christian church will see in sign of Miracle until the appearing of Jesus Christ if God has given me favor before you you believe me in the name of the Lord there's nothing else left in the Bible to be done but take on the mark of the beast and you have the Seal of God so brother Branham was living in 1960 uh for their scene that everything had been fulfilled because all that he was to accomplish everything that he was to do he had finally fulfilled it and he saw all the types and shadows in Abraham and how you know Abraham stood there with the angel of the Lord and the angel of the Lord turned his back to Abraham told him the thoughts and intents of Sarah's heart did all that Supernatural did all those things and showed that that there was judgment now coming to the Earth all in types and shadows and brother Branham had fulfilled all those types and shadows but the people when he preached it when he brought it to the people they rejected it but yet it was the last sign I'm not going to go any further because it we're going to be moving now into another aspect of the opening of the word and how it's so important for us to recognize what took place in 1963. to realize the first the second and the third pull and how it's actually giving us the overcoming ability to meet the challenges of this day and of this hour but we need to realize that this squeeze in this hour this unbelief that will try and and get you to disbelieve the word remember it would be so deceiving in the last days that even the very elect would be deceived if it were possible that level of deception there is absolutely no way you as a human being can overcome that you will be deceived without the Holy Ghost without the spirit of God in you you cannot see you cannot recognize and that's why the progression of the word that keeps taking place in your life every time you come into service every time you feed on the word every time you listen to the prophet every time you you get down and pray there's progression taking place in your life but it brings rejection so we got to just keep pressing on Saints we need to keep feeding on the word of God it is more important now than it's ever been for us to assemble and feed on the manifestation of Christ in this day in this hour in the five-fold ministry amen praise God let the musicians come we need to realize that when we talk about the squeeze it's it's really a spiritual application to the bride that she's coming into her position to recognize who she is in the word of God and the pressure is going to come against you but it's actually Christ in you your hope of glory it's so Supernatural Saints but it's what's happening it's what's taking place we can't fight it we can't allow ourselves to to be caught by the unbelief and try to compromise on on this message there's no compromise on this message that God sent us God sent us a prophet everything that that Prophet preached on all those messages you need them you need to feed on them you cannot leave the prophet out because by leaving the prophet out you're leaving out 1963 which was the coming of the mighty angel he had to decrease so that the mighty Angel could increase so we cannot possibly leave brother Branham out of the equation but to put him as the only aspect and the only way that you're going to go in the Rapture is to press play and just listen without receiving the supernatural element that comes through the five-fold ministry in order to perfect the church you cannot be perfected you need the five-fold ministry you need to recognize the ministry for today praise God let us pray father we thank you tonight Lord for your goodness and your grace Lord and uh just speaking to us tonight in the simple way that you that you make us understand your word Lord we don't know any other way Lord even in 1963 when you came and you stood before the people there and brother Branham was there preaching a series of messages after the experience that he had with those seven angels Lord he opened up on the first night with it with a simple message of recognizing God and God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself Lord you you haven't changed you're still revealing yourself in simple ways and so we ask that your spirit will continue in each and every one of our Lives Lord to to receive and to study and to search your word with prayerful Hearts o God and recognizing that there's something for us in this last day that is our power to overcome and it comes by faith and Faith cometh by hearing your word thank you for what
