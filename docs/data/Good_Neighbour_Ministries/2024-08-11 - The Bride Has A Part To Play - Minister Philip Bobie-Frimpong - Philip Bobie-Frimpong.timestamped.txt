[19:21] thousand to 10,000 we know the enemy is
[19:24] here this morning he's always lying
[19:27] right at the heart of the believer Lord
[19:30] to try to distract them to try to

[38:09] to give God a praise thanks for even
[38:12] wickedness up today not so many people
[38:15] get up from their bed but you by your
[38:17] grace you are here and also we have
[38:21] somebody that you
[38:23] can lay our beding on him people in the
[38:27] world World they go through the same
[38:29] thing we are going through but they
[38:32] don't have no one to commit their
[38:35] problems too but we are so privileged
[38:38] that we are Sons and Daughters of God we
[38:41] can lay all our burdens on the Lord
[38:44] Jesus Christ and that makes the
[38:46] difference amen so without wasting much
[38:49] time let's pick up our
[38:51] scriptures my first scripture will be 2
[38:55] Peter 1 verse 15 to
[39:08] 21 verse 15 to
[39:11] 21
[39:14] moreover I will endeav that ye may be
[39:17] able after my decease to have these
[39:21] things always in
[39:24] remembrance for you have not followed
[39:28] Finly devised fables when he made know
[39:32] unto you the power and the coming of our
[39:35] Lord
[39:37] Jesus Christ but were eye witness of his
[39:42] majesty for he received from God the
[39:48] Father honor and Glory when they came
[39:51] such a
[39:52] voice to him from the excellent Glory
[39:57] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[40:02] pleased um Verse 18 and this voice which
[40:06] came from heaven we heard when you were
[40:08] with him in the Holy
[40:14] Mount we have also a more sure word of
[40:19] Prophecy where unto ye do well that you
[40:22] take heat as unto a light that shineth
[40:26] in a dark place
[40:28] until the day Dawn and the day start
[40:31] arise in your hearts knowing this first
[40:36] that no Prophecy of the scripture is of
[40:40] any private
[40:42] interpretation for the prophecy came not
[40:45] in Old Time by the will of Man by the
[40:48] holy men of God spake as they were moved
[40:52] by the Holy Ghost Joshua 1:3
[41:02] every place that the soul of your foood
[41:04] shall tread upon that have I given unto
[41:07] you as I said unto Moses and the last
[41:10] one Revelation 19 verse 7 to1 maybe
[41:15] verse 7 Revelation
[41:24] 19 let us be glad and
[41:29] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[41:32] marriage of the lamp is come and his
[41:35] wife had made herself ready amen and to
[41:40] her was granted that she should be IR in
[41:43] fine laning clean and white for the fine
[41:46] laning is the righteousness of saints
[41:49] and he said unto me
[41:52] right right right blessed are they which
[41:56] are called unto the marriage supper of
[42:00] the lamp and he said unto me these are
[42:03] the true saying of God and I fell at his
[42:06] she at at his
[42:09] feet to worship him and he said unto me
[42:12] see thou do it not I am thy fellow
[42:17] servant and of thy Brethren that have
[42:20] the Testament of Jesus worship God for
[42:23] the testimony of Jesus is a spirit of
[42:26] Prophecy I titled I will say that um the
[42:29] bride has has a part to play let's pray
[42:34] Heavenly most gracious Eternal God we
[42:37] are here this afternoon morning by your
[42:40] grace and mercy Lord Jesus Christ there
[42:43] is nothing that is hidden from you we
[42:46] are naked before thee we asking you for
[42:48] your mercy and Grace that you forgive us
[42:50] if anyone of us has done anything wrong
[42:53] against you father you didn't mean it
[42:55] but you have this confidence that the
[42:57] blood of Christ washed us from all sins
[43:00] all unbelief so Lord as we come to bring
[43:03] the word take me aside and help me that
[43:06] one word from you Lord will make a
[43:09] difference come and speak to your bride
[43:11] Lord we come against anything like may
[43:14] your spirit take full control over the
[43:16] service and please bless your children
[43:19] oh God let no one live the same way they
[43:22] came may they live more rejoice and more
[43:26] dry to your presence in Jesus name amen
[43:30] please be
[43:33] seated so if I title this I'm going to
[43:37] say that the bride
[43:39] has a part to play or as we said that um
[43:44] the bride has made herself ready and
[43:48] before I go more forth as you read from
[43:52] those
[43:53] Scriptures it tells us
[43:56] that P said
[43:58] that he was there when he heard that
[44:02] voice that
[44:04] said this is my beloved Son hear ye him
[44:08] because at that time they were going
[44:10] trying to make an image for Elijah and
[44:12] some for Moses but there The Voice spoke
[44:17] and said
[44:19] no I'm the only one that deserve to be
[44:22] worshiped God Shar not his office of
[44:25] worship with anyone that's why he kicked
[44:27] the devil out from Heaven because him
[44:30] being a creation of God wanted to
[44:32] receive worship but God never Sayes
[44:35] worship with anyone that's one of the
[44:37] reasons why you know that the Lord Jesus
[44:39] Christ is God because he received
[44:41] worship because it was God in flesh God
[44:44] who could not die as a spirit as a
[44:46] spirit as a spirit created a body to
[44:49] come and live in and die and Sav us and
[44:52] his name is the Lord and Savior Jesus
[44:54] Christ so those thing that came over
[44:57] there that voice because they wanted to
[44:59] make an image for Elijah and for Moses
[45:02] Elijah is a chief justice justice of God
[45:07] Moses is lawgiver and none of us want to
[45:10] approach god with law but you want Grace
[45:13] Grace Grace Grace Grace that is greater
[45:16] than all my sins the Capstone when the
[45:20] cry went out he said Grace Grace Grace
[45:23] it's not by power or by might but by my
[45:26] spirit says the Lord amen because
[45:29] remember the letter kth but the spirit
[45:32] that giveth life amen hallelujah so no
[45:37] scripture is of private
[45:40] interpretation amen and I
[45:42] love
[45:44] um last Sunday what our pastor Danny
[45:49] said
[45:52] about the reason
[45:55] why um we quot the prophet of God God
[45:58] send us a Vindicated prophet and he was
[46:02] trying to say that he was saying that
[46:04] none of
[46:05] us can really say it exactly how he said
[46:09] it that's why some most of the time we
[46:12] bring the quot to back what we are
[46:14] saying and uh I was just thinking about
[46:18] it and I I happened to go to um a coffee
[46:21] shop with a a new brother duie and one
[46:25] brother um the Mexican brother his name
[46:28] is Abel and then we buy coffee and blah
[46:31] blah but in the coffee shop I began to
[46:34] tell them about how this church started
[46:37] how God used Pastor Simon to um he used
[46:43] someone to send two books to him and
[46:46] when he received those two books
[46:48] commotion started he was kick out from
[46:50] the bible college and God used him to
[46:53] set up everything and it happened that I
[46:58] I was supposed to pass by Pastor former
[47:01] Pastor Simon and drop something for him
[47:04] so when we went
[47:06] there H with those brothers p Salon
[47:10] began to talk about the exact same thing
[47:12] I was telling them but the difference is
[47:16] because it was him that went through the
[47:19] whole thing he knew exactly place in
[47:23] Guyana when all those things happens so
[47:26] when was giv his personal testimony it
[47:29] doesn't matter how much I tried to
[47:31] explain to those Brothers when he spoke
[47:33] it there was a difference amen there was
[47:36] a difference because he has been there
[47:38] himself and what we are trying to say is
[47:41] that no one can talk about you than
[47:45] yourself you are your own you can you
[47:49] are the one that have to give your own
[47:51] testimony nobody knows you better than
[47:54] yourself I can talk about things about
[47:57] you but when you are talking about
[47:59] yourself it's a different ball game alog
[48:02] together because you are the one that
[48:03] has gone through it you know what God
[48:06] has done for you so if you can check and
[48:09] see our prophet of God what he does he
[48:12] talk about Elijah talk about Abraham
[48:15] talk about Isaac talk about everything
[48:18] but the testimony of on every instant he
[48:21] bring it back to present day Ministry of
[48:24] what God is doing in his life so what
[48:27] I'm trying to say is that Jesus Christ
[48:29] the same yesterday today and forever
[48:32] it's good to talk about the past it's
[48:34] good to talk about the future but you
[48:36] have to know what God is doing in your
[48:38] personal life right now present stage of
[48:41] his ministry what is God doing through
[48:43] you is your life worthy of the Gospel
[48:47] Are you standing by the word of God or
[48:49] are you just following the crowd are you
[48:52] following just the crowd what is God
[48:55] doing through you as Des said that you
[48:58] cannot talk about my testimony you have
[49:01] to have your own personal experience
[49:03] with God you have to able to give up
[49:05] your own testimony What the Lord Has
[49:09] Done For You amen but we are not trying
[49:12] to bring it to make it like
[49:15] um what am I trying to say to make it so
[49:19] huge and so big that people will look
[49:24] down upon themselves
[49:30] because
[49:31] remember what every what God does is
[49:35] according The Measure of Faith so don't
[49:38] compare yourself with somebody and say
[49:41] God has used this one so big my
[49:44] testimony doesn't mean nothing amen
[49:45] something brother sister amen because
[49:48] listen even to live in this present
[49:52] age the things that is going on for you
[49:56] to even to have have a sound mind it's a
[49:58] victory the prophet said that all the
[50:00] people will go in sane except those that
[50:02] are true bride of Christ to live with
[50:05] your wife and husband for all these
[50:08] years doesn't matter what problems you
[50:10] have and God kept that marriage is a
[50:13] victory Amen to have children and raise
[50:16] them up to have aign man or whatever it
[50:19] is is a victory listen don't take things
[50:23] for granted to have your health is a
[50:26] victory
[50:27] that's why I said um say um speak about
[50:31] what God has done for you it will
[50:33] surprise to What the Lord Has Done For
[50:36] You amen talk about what good things God
[50:39] has done in your past it will surprise
[50:41] you think about that and give testimony
[50:44] of those things and that will R will
[50:48] give you faith that will encourage you
[50:51] so that you can get more and more and
[50:53] more of those so don't look huge things
[50:56] yes the prophet God spoke through him
[50:59] those with that leg get leg with that
[51:01] that's all good that was the height of
[51:04] his ministry I'm not saying that God
[51:06] cannot use us like that because said the
[51:08] works that I do shall you also greater
[51:10] than these because it's going to be a m
[51:12] member body he's the same yesterday
[51:14] today and forever so what I'm
[51:17] encouraging is that just give your
[51:19] testimony and
[51:21] listen Peter and
[51:23] John um what am I trying to say Jesus
[51:26] Christ is same yesterday today and
[51:29] forever so God as a spirit could not die
[51:32] that Spirit created a body to die and to
[51:35] come and live and save us so when he
[51:37] died he gave up The Ghost and then what
[51:40] happened that's when um he went after
[51:44] Calvary he gave his Spirit out he came
[51:47] out that Spirit came out and then on the
[51:50] day of
[51:51] Pentecost those 70 people 120 were the
[51:54] first to witness the Christ Living in us
[51:58] the Holy Ghost and they asked Peter what
[52:01] shall you said men and Brethren repent
[52:04] everyone of you and be baptized in the
[52:07] name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of
[52:10] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[52:13] of the Holy Ghost for the promise is
[52:15] what is unto you and to your children
[52:19] and to them that are even a far of as
[52:22] many as the Lord Our God shall call is
[52:26] God still calling amen if he still
[52:28] calling that promise is for you and me
[52:30] today because he's the same yesterday
[52:33] today and forever and I think I believe
[52:37] that when that thing happened to Peter
[52:39] and John and the rest their faith went
[52:41] up like that amen they began to give a
[52:45] testimony of what God has done for them
[52:48] that's why I say it's important to talk
[52:50] about your testimony amen so remember
[52:53] when when they met that that gate of
[52:55] beautiful
[52:57] amen what they said they said that
[52:59] Silver and Gold Have v n what we have is
[53:02] in the name of Jesus get up and walk and
[53:04] that lay man get up and began to walk
[53:06] and hop amen amen because why Peter and
[53:09] John was giving their testimony and in
[53:12] that meeting when they did that because
[53:16] that man who was
[53:18] was there the Pharisees and the
[53:22] sagues sad you see when God Use Somebody
[53:26] to do this Mighty work instead of them
[53:28] being happy they were grief in their
[53:30] heart why because they didn't want that
[53:32] name of Jesus Christ to be mentioned
[53:34] again and they tried to shut Peter and
[53:36] John down and said don't mention that
[53:39] name said should you listen to man or
[53:41] God Amen we we we what I'm trying to say
[53:44] is that we obey the laws of the land
[53:47] amen don't get me wrong we are obedience
[53:51] but when the law of the land is contrary
[53:54] to this word of God I go by like this
[53:57] amen you can't shut my mouth I believe
[53:59] that's what right Peter did he said that
[54:01] should you listen to man or should you
[54:03] listen to God Amen so when they tried
[54:07] everything they said that these people
[54:10] you can't do nothing to them then they
[54:12] are ignorant and unlearn it bra said
[54:16] that even Peter canot even write his
[54:17] name but you know the
[54:19] emphasize the emphasize is that they
[54:22] have been with Jesus that makes the
[54:25] difference it doesn't matter if you
[54:27] don't even know how your left and right
[54:29] how to read your name or to write your
[54:30] name all that God requires that you have
[54:33] to be with Jesus people have to see the
[54:37] Life of Christ in you it is the life
[54:41] that the demon fear and tremble the name
[54:44] behind the life behind the name that let
[54:47] the demon fear and tremble so they have
[54:49] to see your testimony and then your
[54:52] testimony has to back up with the word
[54:54] of God and the people have to see that
[54:57] you have been with Jesus that's the only
[55:00] requirement there is no any other
[55:03] requirement than being with Jesus you
[55:06] have to project Christ wherever you go
[55:10] let people see Christ in you don't look
[55:13] at somebody's testimony and disregard
[55:16] yourself you are a son or daughter of
[55:19] the Living God the same God is in you
[55:23] the same God that was in the prophet
[55:25] that's in
[55:27] all those High people that same God the
[55:29] same God in the woman who is a wash
[55:32] washing the same God is here God hasn't
[55:35] changed God that that was in Abraham
[55:39] that was in Isaac that was in Jacob that
[55:42] came in the form of a man and died on
[55:45] Calvary and gave up his ghost that same
[55:48] God is here with you and me toight he's
[55:50] in you it's in me have that confidence
[55:53] that God created the whole universe
[55:56] oh yeah he lives
[55:59] in he lives in me he's the same
[56:02] yesterday today and forever he took his
[56:05] prophet he never took his spirit that
[56:08] spirit is here where is Elijah God the
[56:11] god of Elijah that's why we are serving
[56:15] you are not worshiping Elijah we
[56:18] worshiping the god of Elijah and what
[56:20] that God did through Elijah if thou
[56:23] can't believe he can do exact same thing
[56:25] through you
[56:27] according to your faith all things are
[56:30] possible to them that believe amen it's
[56:32] not according to me or what but those
[56:36] that believe all things it's not
[56:40] something all are possible to them that
[56:46] believe that have recognized that they
[56:48] have baptized the name of Jesus they
[56:50] have recognized what God is doing and
[56:53] have that confidence that God did not
[56:55] let a Spirit when he took his Prophet
[56:58] that same spirit is here and he riding
[57:01] the trail in the with the bride once
[57:03] again amen is God in you the hope of
[57:07] your glory he's the same yesterday today

[59:11] never please him with that Revelation
[59:14] hallelujah amen and God himself has to
[59:17] reveal himself to you Hallelujah he's
[59:20] the same yesterday today and
[59:23] forever I'm just going to read this
[59:26] quote here just to back up my point here
[59:33] um God is his own
[59:37] interpreter um paragraph
[59:42] 3338
[59:43] God does his own interpreting to to
[59:49] Hest sincere
[59:52] heart men and women that looks upon upon
[59:56] the things that is mysterious if you are
[1:00:00] Hest and sincere and will
[1:00:04] believe God has a way of interpreting to
[1:00:08] you first find out if it's a promise
[1:00:12] Hallelujah if Joseph had just have went
[1:00:16] back and got away from the traditions
[1:00:20] and went back to the Bible and find out
[1:00:22] what Isaiah said she was going to do
[1:00:25] that
[1:00:26] and the place I like vers 38 he said as
[1:00:30] I was preaching a few weeks ago living
[1:00:33] in a glare a glare is a marriage Mirage
[1:00:38] sorry the sun reflecting itself and is
[1:00:43] false and any glare of another age is
[1:00:47] false
[1:00:49] reflection the people always are walking
[1:00:52] in something that happened years ago
[1:00:55] they look are working in a Lutheran
[1:00:58] glare Luther's sunlight was fine in his
[1:01:02] day Wesley was good in his day Pentecost
[1:01:08] was good in his day we are going up on
[1:01:12] the ladder you are living in another age
[1:01:16] we are going on and we can't keep
[1:01:18] looking back so every age the people who
[1:01:24] recognize what God is doing they are the
[1:01:27] children of God in that
[1:01:30] age and what happen that God is his own
[1:01:35] interpreter he makes it
[1:01:38] clear the Bible has said a virgin shall
[1:01:42] conceived and he'll be born in Bethlehem
[1:01:45] he gave all those
[1:01:48] descriptions but the firest SE they s
[1:01:51] Seas they have what make up their old
[1:01:54] way that thing will happen so when that
[1:01:57] thing happened right in their eyes they
[1:02:01] did not see
[1:02:03] it and is a history always repeat
[1:02:07] itself God is his own interpreter he
[1:02:11] make it plain plain as plain can be he
[1:02:14] said a virgin shall conceive He he'll be
[1:02:18] born in Bethlehem all those things were
[1:02:21] de clear in the Bible the Pharisees they
[1:02:25] have read the Bible they know they can
[1:02:28] just put a pin and tell you every
[1:02:31] scripture to the
[1:02:33] dot but when the thing happened they
[1:02:36] couldn't see it but Simon someone who
[1:02:40] was blind man he was waiting on God he
[1:02:44] had an honest heart he was looking to
[1:02:46] the Lord Jesus Christ and God has to
[1:02:49] visit him and told him Simon go here
[1:02:52] this is that lady Mary was look upon
[1:02:56] down was look down they thought she has
[1:03:00] committed adultery nobody know the
[1:03:03] father of his son and they were making
[1:03:05] moery of him and when you think about it
[1:03:10] the Lord that created the whole universe
[1:03:12] gold silver everything is his he came he
[1:03:16] didn't even have a place to sleep they
[1:03:18] cover him with a swadling clothes and I
[1:03:22] imagine all those people were getting
[1:03:23] away and what making not about Mary
[1:03:28] saying something bad about her but she
[1:03:31] knew what the Angels spoke to her she
[1:03:35] knew that she has SM the angel for
[1:03:36] herself so it doesn't matter what the
[1:03:39] people are saying she didn't pay any
[1:03:41] attention to them so it's a true bride
[1:03:43] of Christ you knew we have been in that
[1:03:47] that room with the Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:03:49] knew how God came to you you alone knew
[1:03:52] how God has revealed himself to you and
[1:03:55] nobody what the people tell I remember
[1:03:57] when God called me my friends thought I
[1:03:59] was cuckoo here but I wasn't cuckoo I've
[1:04:03] met the Lord Jesus Christ I know what
[1:04:05] God was doing in my life I was so
[1:04:08] confident I'm so sure of what God was
[1:04:11] doing because I have been what carrying
[1:04:14] the word of God from that time Mary was
[1:04:17] carrying that word of God in her womb
[1:04:19] she didn't
[1:04:21] care how mocky people were thinking
[1:04:23] about
[1:04:24] her she she knew what she was
[1:04:27] caring so you knew what God what has
[1:04:30] come to you so doesn't matter what the
[1:04:33] people from outside talks about you look
[1:04:36] down upon you persecute you ridic you
[1:04:40] say what by you you know what you are
[1:04:44] caring is the word of the Living God so
[1:04:47] you don't look at those things just give
[1:04:51] God thanks give him praise give him the
[1:04:53] glory give him honor thank you for
[1:04:56] everything because he has done great
[1:04:58] things in our lives by even all mind the
[1:05:01] greatest thing that could ever happened
[1:05:04] to anyone is a Salvation of their soul
[1:05:07] and you and I have come to recognize
[1:05:12] that the god that created the whole
[1:05:15] universe he has come to us as he came to

[1:07:15] bring it to pass in Psalm 107 said
[1:07:20] that commit your ways to God and he will
[1:07:23] bring it to pass he will bring
[1:07:26] everything to pass just commit it to him
[1:07:28] because you cannot solve those problems
[1:07:31] I cannot solve it but God can solve it
[1:07:35] so lay
[1:07:37] everything in front of him and don't
[1:07:40] hold anything your heart against anybody

[1:07:49] you don't forgive how your heavenly
[1:07:51] father also forgive you so let's forgive
[1:07:54] and move on
[1:07:56] and believe that God will what do Mighty
[1:07:59] Works through us because he's the same
[1:08:01] yesterday today and forever he's an
[1:08:05] awesome let's give him an
[1:08:07] Applause our God is
[1:08:10] good all the time amen praise God
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:17] hallelujah oh thank you and Abel offered
[1:08:22] an excellent Sacrifice by revelation and
[1:08:25] God will testify of his gift in him so
[1:08:31] if you do the Bible said anything done
[1:08:34] without FEI is
[1:08:35] sin so anything you do with Revelation
[1:08:39] behind it as God testify of Abel's
[1:08:43] sacrifice he will testify of yours too
[1:08:46] but if you do it just to please people
[1:08:49] or you do it because someone tells you
[1:08:51] to do it and you don't have the
[1:08:54] understanding why you doing it is going
[1:08:56] to be stink in God's nose God don't want
[1:08:58] us to be a
[1:09:00] copycat just do it because somebody said
[1:09:02] do it and even if you're going to do it
[1:09:05] have an understanding why you are doing
[1:09:08] it because God hasn't changed and he the
[1:09:12] same yesterday today and
[1:09:15] forever God could have let the children
[1:09:18] of
[1:09:20] Israel give them Victory everything is
[1:09:23] that right but he took told them that
[1:09:26] everywhere that you put your foot I've
[1:09:29] given to you footsteps mean
[1:09:33] possession so there's a part we have to
[1:09:37] play there's a decisions we have to make
[1:09:40] in every marriage before that marriage
[1:09:44] takes place
[1:09:46] um that let me just uh see if I can just
[1:09:51] um make it more simple here
[1:09:56] uh before every marriage takes place
[1:09:58] that's fine there's a decisions that we
[1:10:00] have to make is that right when the man
[1:10:05] me the
[1:10:07] bride the bride has
[1:10:09] to the man has to propose to the bride
[1:10:14] and the bride has a
[1:10:16] choice to accept or reject it is that
[1:10:20] right and I believe that
[1:10:27] God sometimes most of the
[1:10:30] time some people they like to play
[1:10:34] around things they don't want to be
[1:10:36] certain so you got to be put in a PO a
[1:10:39] spot that you have to make a decision
[1:10:42] because the groom and the bride they can
[1:10:44] be friends and talk for so many years
[1:10:47] now these days they want to just called
[1:10:49] for like 10 years 5 years before they
[1:10:50] get married but some men don't don't
[1:10:53] have don't want them don't want their
[1:10:55] time to be
[1:10:56] wasted so they'll bring to a point that
[1:11:00] he's going to go and propose to you and
[1:11:02] said do you love me I love you I want to
[1:11:04] marry you at that time you cannot
[1:11:08] hide you are forced to make a
[1:11:11] decision yes or
[1:11:14] no so is with the word of God when God
[1:11:18] comes to you can accept this or you can
[1:11:20] reject
[1:11:21] it and all those things God bring people
[1:11:26] to that point I believe one time Joshua
[1:11:30] saw the same thing if the God on the
[1:11:33] other side is God you people worship him
[1:11:37] I and my family you going to Worship the
[1:11:39] Lord Jesus Christ he made that choice
[1:11:42] Elijah told them if bail be bail worship
[1:11:45] bail if God is God worship God so God
[1:11:49] doesn't want a lukewarm
[1:11:53] Christianity hot or cold
[1:11:55] you have to make a choice you have to
[1:11:59] make a decision I believe that
[1:12:03] Nom brought Ruth and opah in that same
[1:12:08] Junction of time they were forced to
[1:12:12] make a
[1:12:14] decision and in that
[1:12:16] decision Opa being a type of the larm
[1:12:20] denominational church he just walk away
[1:12:23] because Naomi presented it to her in
[1:12:27] such a way that there's no need for her
[1:12:29] to follow her because she said now I'm
[1:12:33] an old lady even if I have to go and get
[1:12:36] another man to get married are you going
[1:12:39] to be able to wait until I get a child
[1:12:42] and then you go and marry that child so
[1:12:46] naturally it look very what it look very
[1:12:51] it doesn't make sense for them to follow
[1:12:54] neomi
[1:12:55] but Ruth was of a different spirit I
[1:12:59] believe she was of the bright Spirit she
[1:13:02] said whever you go I will go with you
[1:13:06] your people will be my
[1:13:08] people your if wherever you die I'll die
[1:13:11] with you whever you eat I'll eat with
[1:13:14] you your God will be my God that's what
[1:13:18] God is expecting from us to make that
[1:13:22] right commitment that decision said Lord
[1:13:25] I'm following you through think or think
[1:13:29] I've made up my mind to go God's way all
[1:13:32] the way amen Goodbye old world I have
[1:13:35] nothing to do with you My Mind Is Made
[1:13:38] Up To Go God's way all the time amen so
[1:13:43] we have to make
[1:13:44] decisions after the decisions are made I
[1:13:48] think the next thing is
[1:13:51] um
[1:13:53] engagement after engagement is the
[1:13:56] wedding end the wedding
[1:13:59] ceremony Hallelujah I think I have
[1:14:02] something that clarify here
[1:14:12] yeah okay the promise made there has to
[1:14:15] be a promise made to one another like
[1:14:16] that you make a promise sweetheart if
[1:14:19] you marry me I promise that I'll be
[1:14:25] loyal and true I'll look upon no other
[1:14:29] woman or I'll look upon no other man and
[1:14:33] I'll do all that as a duty as a wife we
[1:14:36] have children it will do all as a duty
[1:14:40] as a as a mother I will be a housekeeper
[1:14:44] all the promise has got to be made or
[1:14:47] should be in a correct wding and that's
[1:14:51] the same thing when you come to Christ
[1:14:55] Lord if you receive me in your kingdom I
[1:15:00] promise there you are I'll love you
[1:15:03] sometime you forgot our first love I'll
[1:15:06] be true to you I'll serve you day and
[1:15:09] night it's too bad we forget that I'll
[1:15:14] serve you day and night I'll fast I'll
[1:15:16] pray I'll be loyal to you I'll bring my
[1:15:20] Tian into your Storehouse I'll pray many
[1:15:23] times a day I'll I will do
[1:15:26] anything and I'll pledge all my love to
[1:15:30] you that's what we should do that's
[1:15:33] exactly right where you promise that and
[1:15:37] should come from your heart so when that
[1:15:42] woman made that promise to the woman to
[1:15:45] the
[1:15:46] husband and that promise is not
[1:15:50] coming from her
[1:15:52] heart she's receiv receiving that
[1:15:56] man but you can't deceive
[1:15:58] God so that woman is just raising the
[1:16:02] children for that man because in her
[1:16:04] heart she didn't make that promise from
[1:16:07] the depth of her
[1:16:09] heart so that woman is not
[1:16:14] 100%
[1:16:15] true to the
[1:16:17] man she's just raising her
[1:16:21] children but if it comes from heart
[1:16:25] through death pain or sorrow of
[1:16:29] enjoyment she stick they stay together
[1:16:33] because she love her and that love is
[1:16:35] not based on any
[1:16:37] condition it's based on a pure
[1:16:40] love that's why right now if money was
[1:16:44] to be the evidence or a milestone for
[1:16:46] love then Elon mask um Jeff Bezos and
[1:16:52] bate they'll still be keeping their
[1:16:53] wives
[1:16:56] it's based on the
[1:16:58] love so it's the love of God in our
[1:17:01] heart that makes a difference and
[1:17:06] if you make that promise andore from
[1:17:09] your heart that marriage artificial
[1:17:12] marriage the same thing we have tooth
[1:17:16] your tooth broke you replace it it's a
[1:17:20] artificial tooth you're not taking that
[1:17:22] with you those things replace the we are
[1:17:25] not is not going back it's attached to
[1:17:27] us but it's not part of
[1:17:29] us you understand what I'm saying so to
[1:17:32] be part of God is to be born
[1:17:37] again that's a true Christian and to be
[1:17:41] born again it means that before you even
[1:17:45] came here God knew you before the
[1:17:48] foundations of the world we did not
[1:17:50] become SE by what the r birth we were SE
[1:17:55] and therefore you were reborn for any
[1:17:58] elect can only the elect can be reborn
[1:18:02] so because we are seed of God we can
[1:18:05] what be reborn and we make those
[1:18:08] decisions from our heart and God being
[1:18:12] God did not wait for you to make that
[1:18:15] decision because he being god with his
[1:18:18] elective and predestinated and for
[1:18:21] knowledge he knew before you even make
[1:18:25] that decision based on that he said
[1:18:27] Jacob have I loved Esau have I hatte
[1:18:31] before those children were even what
[1:18:34] born that same God is here tonight so
[1:18:39] you can't be a Christian until Christ
[1:18:42] inject himself by the baptism of the
[1:18:45] Holy Ghost into you then you are
[1:18:48] connected with him you are no longer
[1:18:53] Twain
[1:18:55] you are
[1:18:56] one Christ promised to be in us as the
[1:18:59] father was in Christ I am my father are
[1:19:04] one you and I are one see Christ in us
[1:19:11] all that was what that God was he poured
[1:19:14] into Christ and all that Christ was he
[1:19:18] poured into the church to continue what
[1:19:21] the work of the gospel and we are the
[1:19:24] Contin ation of the book of Acts
[1:19:27] whatever God did through the apostles I
[1:19:30] believe he's doing the same thing
[1:19:32] through US amen true us and in us
[1:19:35] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:19:38] and forever we have an awesome God so
[1:19:42] the bride has a part to
[1:19:45] play and her part is to make herself
[1:19:51] ready just like Esther
[1:19:57] Esther when the king were looking for
[1:20:01] virgins she didn't go with material
[1:20:05] adoring of the
[1:20:07] body braam says she went with a pure an
[1:20:11] excellent Spirit That's What attracted
[1:20:14] the
[1:20:15] king is a pure Spirit a Bible say that a
[1:20:19] contract and a broken spirit I will not
[1:20:23] despise and what is that pure Spirit
[1:20:27] what is that pure heart that Pure Heart
[1:20:30] Is What by washing of the word by the
[1:20:33] word of God you let the word of God wash
[1:20:36] you and cleanses you by the word of God
[1:20:39] that give you what that Purity around
[1:20:41] you and God is looking for an honest
[1:20:44] heart and pure heart because without
[1:20:46] that you always going to be artificial
[1:20:49] you cannot be part of him but those who
[1:20:51] are part of him they have that ability
[1:20:54] to receive that word of God and live it
[1:20:58] as said that those who hearts are pure
[1:21:01] will see God it's a
[1:21:04] scripture but the Purity comes by
[1:21:07] cleansing your heart just like Esther
[1:21:10] she makes sure her heart was clean so
[1:21:13] when she met the king the king all those
[1:21:17] women that came with all those all those
[1:21:19] kind of dressing blah blah blah she he
[1:21:22] put them as a concubines but when he met
[1:21:25] and felt the presence the atmosphere and
[1:21:29] ran I said this is the one she is my
[1:21:33] bride amen and what he he took her to be
[1:21:38] her wife so our part is to what have the
[1:21:44] pure Spirit around us amen that's most
[1:21:48] important thing our God is good he's the
[1:21:52] same yesterday today and forever he
[1:21:56] hasn't changed amen whatever he promised
[1:21:58] to do he'll do it again hallelujah thank
[1:22:02] you Lord amen hallelujah praise our God
[1:22:08] so what am I trying to say that we have
[1:22:12] to be
[1:22:14] ready because we have a part to
[1:22:17] play and remember somewhere in the Bible
[1:22:21] it says that the people were son
[1:22:23] ascender
[1:22:25] they were uh they didn't have a place to
[1:22:30] to sleep they did all those things but
[1:22:33] they without us shall not be what made
[1:22:36] perfect the Olympics that they just ran
[1:22:40] they everybody left those when the Baton
[1:22:43] was changing they left their fastest guy
[1:22:47] in the last
[1:22:48] lap amen and Canada left Andre the grass
[1:22:53] who is our best guy
[1:22:55] on the last lap to complete the race so
[1:22:58] God has done to you and me he has left
[1:23:01] us at the last
[1:23:03] ones to come to finish the race so let's
[1:23:07] finish the race with what pure heart and
[1:23:11] let's not give up on anything because
[1:23:14] you are the one they are depending on us
[1:23:17] all those people that you look to Peter
[1:23:20] Paul oh man this is the most glorious
[1:23:23] age
[1:23:24] if there was any time that this a
[1:23:26] glorious age yet is the most deceiving
[1:23:29] age but it's the best of times it's the
[1:23:32] best of age that God is revealing
[1:23:34] himself he has never revealed himself
[1:23:36] the highest manner like this before amen
[1:23:39] all those things listen it's a two-way
[1:23:42] thing all those demons from Nimrod and
[1:23:46] all those things are all cating but all
[1:23:49] those Spirit from Adam from Joshua from
[1:23:52] all those things are also what house
[1:23:54] communting us and we we are what greater
[1:23:59] is greater he that is in you than he
[1:24:01] that's in the world so God of the whole
[1:24:04] universe is in you and it's in me and is
[1:24:06] able to face every challenge that you
[1:24:09] come across in this time so just don't
[1:24:12] lose hope no matter what comes your way
[1:24:16] our life is in his hand he will fight
[1:24:18] our battles he will give us the victory
[1:24:22] victory in Jesus Christ
[1:24:24] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:24:26] forever our God is awesome he has done
[1:24:30] Mighty work to us let's remember to
[1:24:33] thank him to give him praise and
[1:24:34] adoration all the time because he
[1:24:36] deserve our worship he deserve to be

[1:25:32] of is butam Sam said that he has been in
[1:25:35] battle and been fighting ever since for
[1:25:36] all these 30 years but you see God has
[1:25:39] come to a place the the word has come to
[1:25:42] a place that God has given us a rest and
[1:25:45] we realize that our human effort we
[1:25:48] can't do anything so we are resting on
[1:25:51] his word we are resting on him to our B
[1:25:55] to do everything for us because our
[1:25:57] might we cannot do it it has come to a
[1:26:01] part that it takes God
[1:26:03] himself some situations that some people
[1:26:06] are going through we are going through
[1:26:08] it takes God on the scene it takes God
[1:26:11] on the scene it takes God himself to
[1:26:14] overcome those situations and if that
[1:26:16] God lives in you when the time comes he
[1:26:18] will show up amen when there he will
[1:26:23] show up you just
[1:26:26] relax he show up when he has to show
[1:26:29] [Laughter]
[1:26:31] up so don't worry all things are
[1:26:35] possible to them that love God when the
[1:26:38] time for him to show up he will show up
[1:26:41] amen praise God our God is good he's a
[1:26:46] wonderful God Amen I'm going to
[1:26:50] just give my last word and then I'm
[1:26:54] going to prepared I don't talk for too
[1:26:56] long so don't don't worry about me
[1:26:59] that's the way I am I'm not long uh
[1:27:03] speaker so I'm going to be trying to R
[1:27:06] wind up very
[1:27:08] soon um one other thing
[1:27:11] too you
[1:27:14] see um what am I
[1:27:17] saying the wise men in their
[1:27:22] time they look
[1:27:25] and saw the linting of the
[1:27:27] stars and when they saw that they knew
[1:27:32] that the Mah was
[1:27:34] Bor and I believe the wise men in our
[1:27:37] age in our time is a bride of Christ and
[1:27:42] we look through a prophetic eye that God
[1:27:45] said as a Vindicator Prophet his name is
[1:27:48] William Aon Braham and God gave him
[1:27:51] seven visions and all those seven Vision
[1:27:53] has come to pass and weew that with this
[1:27:57] things happening our Redemption is
[1:28:00] drawing nearer when you look at what
[1:28:03] happened in Israel Britain in chaos
[1:28:06] everywhere in chaos if you look at
[1:28:09] things that happened around you even
[1:28:11] people who are not Christians they could
[1:28:14] sense something is coming something is
[1:28:18] not right the whole world isul by Sodom
[1:28:22] Spirit as it was the the days of Sodom
[1:28:25] and Gomorrah so shall it be when the
[1:28:27] stand of man is revealed we are in Sodom
[1:28:30] everything is sodomite the whole word is
[1:28:32] gone insane you look at Israel oh man
[1:28:36] fight they fight everywhere on from many
[1:28:39] on many fronts and God is fighting their
[1:28:41] battle for them and we are type of
[1:28:43] Israel the Bride is a spiritual Israel
[1:28:47] so it means that there a battle going on
[1:28:49] but God is the one who's fighting for
[1:28:51] our battles he going to give us a
[1:28:53] victory
[1:28:54] because we have already overcome already
[1:28:57] overcome he overcome already just have
[1:29:00] to follow his voice follow that voice of
[1:29:04] God the voice that call you the voice
[1:29:07] that have followed all these years
[1:29:09] that's God's voice is going to lead you
[1:29:12] through have confidence in that voice
[1:29:15] it's the voice of God it let do nothing
[1:29:18] to to the pure word of God for your age
[1:29:21] so we have to have confidence in that
[1:29:23] voice that the voice of God will lead
[1:29:26] you through amen that little small voice
[1:29:29] don't ignore it just be attentive and
[1:29:33] spiritual to it God want to speak to you
[1:29:36] what going to direct you don't brush it
[1:29:39] off let God have
[1:29:42] preeminence lay aside every weight of
[1:29:44] sin that Bes set us let God move through
[1:29:49] our ministry so that we can be a
[1:29:51] blessing amen because when the last one
[1:29:54] comes in we are going but how can he
[1:29:57] come we have to Avail ourselves are you
[1:29:59] ready for God to use you he said the
[1:30:02] Harvest are plenty but the laborers are
[1:30:04] few are you the one availing yourself so
[1:30:07] that God can use you in this end time it
[1:30:11] doesn't mean that maybe you have to win
[1:30:12] 10 souls or whatever whatever God wants
[1:30:14] you to do listen one time God told the
[1:30:17] prophet just go and C somebody's
[1:30:20] grass that was the purpose that God
[1:30:22] wants him to do
[1:30:24] just be attentive he can use it for
[1:30:26] bigger things I'm not um neglecting that
[1:30:30] he can use to do raise the dead do
[1:30:32] everything it's all part of his ministry
[1:30:34] can just tell just give somebody a tip
[1:30:36] or give somebody a right just something
[1:30:39] small do something for somebody read
[1:30:41] help him whatever it is I don't know but
[1:30:44] just be attentive to that little small
[1:30:48] voice so that you don't miss your
[1:30:49] blessing and count your blessings and
[1:30:52] name them one by one it will surprise
[1:30:54] you what does God has done for you and
[1:30:58] the last
[1:30:59] thing um I read last week about
[1:31:04] Rwanda that they Clos about 5 or 7,000
[1:31:08] churches and they saying that oh all
[1:31:11] those T because if the wise
[1:31:14] men could see that the L of the stars
[1:31:18] and could know that the Messiah is born
[1:31:21] so is a bride of chist you have to be
[1:31:23] what wake up and see the things that
[1:31:25] happen around
[1:31:27] us and they have closed all those
[1:31:31] churches they say they said most so they
[1:31:33] are not signing through blah blah but
[1:31:35] behind that they hide a word that most
[1:31:39] of them those Pentecostal CH they have
[1:31:41] no theological
[1:31:44] certificate is it the time that they
[1:31:47] using as a pilot program to come against
[1:31:51] us without those theological
[1:31:53] certificates I don't know but all these
[1:31:56] things should let us awake when you see
[1:31:59] what happening in Israel when you see
[1:32:01] things that is going on we should be
[1:32:04] aler like those wise men knowing that
[1:32:08] our Redemption is Drawing Near amen amen
[1:32:15] so many things you can see so many
[1:32:18] that's
[1:32:19] happening even braam said I was going to
[1:32:22] be a a vice president and the woman the
[1:32:24] purple and all those things happening
[1:32:27] happening in our eyes we've seen all
[1:32:29] that Catholic Church ruling now in the
[1:32:32] US Congress they have inflated all they
[1:32:35] have infiltrated all mostly Catholics
[1:32:38] Roman Church ruling everything what time
[1:32:41] are we living in sin I believe that when
[1:32:44] Daniel read Jeremiah writings it put him
[1:32:47] under desperation and there was a time
[1:32:50] that the bride of Christ has be
[1:32:51] desperate is now and if you know want to
[1:32:54] be desperate he going to put that to
[1:32:56] make you desperate you're going to bring
[1:32:58] situations your life that going to put
[1:32:59] you on your knees to cry to seek his
[1:33:02] face to have more of him so that you can
[1:33:05] fulfill your purpose amen because there
[1:33:08] musicians can get can begin to come
[1:33:12] there's some purpose that you have to
[1:33:15] fulfill there's something that you alone
[1:33:17] has to fulfill I cannot do it you have
[1:33:20] to do
[1:33:22] it no and listen
[1:33:25] even if you chose not to and you try to
[1:33:29] run away and do what whatever God has
[1:33:32] purpose to happen through you it will
[1:33:34] come to pass one time Zacharia refused
[1:33:38] the voice of God and and doubted his
[1:33:41] doubt didn't stop God from bringing John
[1:33:43] the Baptist through his lineage that
[1:33:46] same God is here so being a son or
[1:33:49] daughter of God sometime you have choice
[1:33:52] and you have no choice

[1:33:56] paradox but one of these days one of
