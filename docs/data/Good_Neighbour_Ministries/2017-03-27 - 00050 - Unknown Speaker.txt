Thessalonians is the Lord himself shall descend from the heavens with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel in the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall run there's three things that has to happen before the Lord is St with him the first thing happens a shout a b a com Jesus does all three of them when he descend a shout what is a shout it's the message going forth ver the living bread

back together the shout and the the same morning with a loud voice he screamed out with that shout uh and and voice and B GL and voice up wakes up the sleeping bride sleeping dead and the trumpet the sound of the trumpet and when it does it calls always a trumpet called Israel to the Feast of the trumpets which was the Pentecostal Feast the great feast in the sky and a feast of trumpets and now a trumpet denounced calling together come to the feast and now that is the the Lamb's supper in the sky the beast of the com of waiting supper we have seen it en ties now watch just this moment three is the witness now we've already had three raptures in the Old Testament did you know that as a wi what Enoch was one Elijah was other and Jesus was the other Jesus being the Keystone now if you bear record see he was the Keystone between the Old and New Testament because he had the ver and man R died come to life walked with us it was raptured up because he was a to tie the two together after his resurrection Rapture after he did that and proed that the Old Testament there we all know en was translated we know Elijah was taken up by world right the CH the Father and Jesus died buried rose up Earth was raptured up there's three to Bear record is that right now there has been one Rapture already pass when Jesus DED screamed with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was written Twain From the top to the bottom and the earth quake and the Rocks the r and the graves were open and many of the bodies of the Saints slept arose and came out of the Grave after his resurrection went into the holy city and appeared under one Rapture is three happened in the Old Testament notice verse 50 his loud voice awaken the Old Testament Saints just exactly like the loud

oh our Lord is coming [Applause] [Music] [Music] back again oh our is coming [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's brother glory to God now you can put up the background please be seated our scripture is right there before you first Thessalonians oh I didn't anyway then we which are alive First Corinthians we which alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord Lord amen amen we have been speaking on this last week we spoke uh on this topic of the Rapture and uh today uh we will continue and it's possible I may have another week speaking on the Rapture and we found that uh for us to be in the Rapture uh there are some requirements and if I were to ask as you heard the prophet himself are you ready in your heart of hearts do you know that you're ready are you really certain of God are you living as close as you possibly can we're not talking about fanaticism but we're talking about reality amen because as this message of the prophet of Malachi 4 seems to be a advancing and going forward it seems like the message is starting to become like a fantasy or a story that was told long ago or something that the younger folks just imagined uh so we have to keep it before you to remind you that it's real and that if you die tonight without uh Christ without being born again without this Revelation you're lost and you're gone to a devil's hell we need to talk a little bit more about hell because we talk about heaven it's Christ Our chaos amen it's Heaven or Hell one of the two what are we living for we got to live and be real to God and to ourselves and not just be a put on to the other message Believers around you that we can produce prophets words that we people can manufacture produce such a front that we look all we the mest religious and everything else and you can be a renegade a scadron a Outlaw a liar a cheat a no good arrest from the word of God we got to be real within ourselves listen I'm not just talking to you I'm feeling it while I'm talking because it's real to me if I don't live it that way it's no use my getting up there I'm talking to you or even making a claim that I'm a Believer right amen we've got to get this thing right where the rubber hits the road not on our lips but in our heart and in our feet walk with God God yes Lord until it grips you not you got the message but the message grips you until it let you go you're a prisoner you can't get away from it amen look I know Brothers uh that you know they go back up wide in the world and they try to drink it away they they try to go with friends do this do that in the middle of it all one of the S say you shouldn't be here you know you you're some kind of Christian you shouldn't be here I I and the spirit of God rebuking that believer through Sinners that don't even know their background and tell them you're out of place you shouldn't be here at all amen let me tell you sometimes God will use a sinner to rebuke into your face amen praise God look we not we not Mali four time like yourself this is Rapture time this is Harvest Time the grain that received the word down Through the Ages is now ripening ripening As We Lay in the presence of the August F son what's he talking about trials may come but the trials only come to make you strong that's right it come to kill you it didn't come to break you and can to make you you got to get to a place where recognize that the trials God sends away it's not for you to mour and Mo and fall over but your spirit should be a spirit of [Applause] e break out to your prison shake off the shackles walk in the light of your that's the only way we going to make it let what out in the world this la lay around a lazy loose Spirit just do whatever they want five women two pre whatever you know whatever they live every they sleeping this one today sleep next one tomorrow and then I'm going to W up my mind later oh God help you young people don't let that spirit in the world get holy amen don't let the looseness the likeness that's controlling them come and jump on you amen amen praise God we got to pray for our young people amen and I don't I mean pray hard pray because the devil is on their track and he's trying to hold them and keep them and pull them out amen we see several of gravs grow in this church from Sunday school listen we not here to to to push you and force you to be a Christian because it's all by lecture it's not because my father was Abraham and my mother was Sarah mean that I am going to be automatically saved I'm automatically going to be a Christian or there a failure if you don't get saved because let me tell you out of the same place y the prophet said come go good and evil yes out of the holy mother and father come Jacob and Es yes that's not their problem it's why you [Music] but they need to at least create the environment of Christianity they need to at least create the uh all the things that will be needed so that the child has no excuse you train them to talk them to show them everything andc to go other way you can advise but let me tell you every man have to answer for themselves Hallelujah why under your control uh in in terms of age and they get to a certain point when they become out they're still under your your guidance your counseling and everything else like that but become more mature they have to answer for themselves amen amen is that right yes praise God they have to answer for themselves yes sir and we're in a serious time where the devil's machine is grinding meat into uh you know I'm I'm just visualizing taking beef and throwing it in a grinder and grinding it that's how the devil is doing today and turning people into uh you know just grinding them up if God says who are these that eat up of the people eating up the people all the day long oh my that's why he said here the only things going to be in the Rapture is the Bride of Jesus Christ amen it will come to pass there would be genuine love among the people except for those that are in the bride of Christ make up put on everything is fake is that right even the women they giving them makeup right so and they end up they they're calling it to a mask it's not their real face what you see is a mask when they finished with with everything else they end up in a mask I'm talking about the Rapture but I'm trying to tell you the environment we are in that we have to be in that Rapture and the only way you're going to get in listen I truly be believe that before the church can have the rapure it's got to have rapturing faith amen you're not going to the Rapture unless you have rapturing faith rapturing faith amen listen we can't even have fi for our own Divine Healing let theone Rapture in faith we can't even uh God got to have faith we got to have faith now that will change and quit this Mortal body so it can be taken away Hallelujah I believe that there is a church like that on it Road tonight that church is a power of the Living God that that man will speak the word here and the word will go forth and Flash lightning from the amen and the church is coming out amen is coming out now not some psychologist church not some put onen not some make believe but a real genuine anointed Holy Ghost called out Church of the Living God prise be to God that's the Church of God the prophet of God looked and saw a church coming out believing the word now we know we talked about this rapture faith and we realize friends that rapturing faith means rapturing Revelation on the video you saw there they the Bible with the sword and across the revealed word amen not just the message not just the reading the Bible but the word revealed to you and then what does that do it gives you the rapturing faith rapturing fath he said is found in these messages rapturing Faith what is it it's not rapturing believing would be he no Rapture in faith and I show to you that Luther had one Faith justification amen sanctification that was the faith of the hour or the revealed word of the hour or the Revelation for the hour that would give those people in that age rapturing faith that was the faith to Rapture them out they just have to have justification to Rapture them out the next one only had to have this to Rapture them out now we are the ones at the end of the age and everything the whole world has been revealed to us and it's not rapturing believing it's the rapturing with the revelation of the prophet's message when it's made clear and plain to you and grips your heart you become Serv of God and that in you praise God hallelujah so it's not you got to walk around believing go rap tomorrow your faith week I may not go no once is revealed to you in that way and you recognize your position Hallelujah that there is only not many FS not this one that one but one thing one more one baptism praise God I'm coning honestly for that Faith praise God is this making sense amen thank you Lord amen oh John came forth he said he had commission to write everything he seen But when them seven th UT their voices of Revelation 10 don't write them at all Revelation 10 come down from heaven John said I saw a my angel come down from the heavens amen having a little book in his hand and he there he Wasing with his voice when he his voice seven T voices put his foot on the land and upon the sea and says time shall be no longer there should be no delay in other words this thing has got to be fulfilled now praise God and Revelation 10 amen Revelation 101 the mighty Angel come down and we read in Revelation 10:7 that he went to Revelation 107 Amen to fulfill Malachi 45 by going inside of Revelation 10 amen yes sir and in reation 10:7 which is a prophet he gave him th the Lord not say williiam BR down but God as he was in mes as he was in the El God was speaking through the prophet I'm here [Applause] now you see what I'm he said I'm just standing here I'm just honored to be just aess instrument from God to you and the voice spoke out thus said the Lord amen your time your grace we get ready to go now hallelujah amen any day now he can split the Eastern Sky I'm not talking about the second coming when he comes back in flesh to Earth again like the last psong that was really talking about when he comes back to Earth again the next time but what I'm saying I'm talking about the Rapture right now amen hallelujah but he takes us out here now he told John to write write everything you see but yet when Revelation Ed the voice and Revelation 7 begin to preach it he turns around and says joh all right that's why people say the Bible contradicts but it doesn't contradict at all there's a reason why he said don't right now we understand that John only had a a glimpse of it and he did not have the full Revelation and John could only write the written word but there is no way for John to uh ascribe or inscribe the unwritten word right right because the unwritten word that it can't be written down that has to be re not written word but Ral word where God now reveals it to the individual because you see the Theologian can take the written word and teach it the masses they can teach you to make money they can teach you to become famous they can teach you for various reasons because that's the written word and it's like you're speaking in general but when you come down to the revealed word it starts to get specific an individual Amen to this one I Ral to that one to that one and each one at a different time it's not M thing where you just preach and everybody catches it at the same time that's why in every Church Believers are at different levels of spiritual growth never be the same like that not nature tells you that you look at the field the whole field doesn't come up all at the same time right no they one by one they G Port amen I'm not talking about heaven now I'm talking about breaking in to the revelation of the word amen hallelujah one by one we the P there to dwell with the Immortals because when the Revelation breaks into you breaks and you break into that realm he says you you you enter already into eternity you're potentially resurrected you're on the way the the process start turn imortality imortality of the word of God getting a hold of your soul amen begin to work from your soul Spirit right into your body Same Spirit that ra Christ from the dead when Quicken [Applause] your sir that prove that he is able to resurrect the dead body so that you would have fith for so when he comes again that you can believe that he's able to raise you up and that power is PA said that power work in us now work in us now the change is right on now brother B said it's going on now he says you're raised up from sin didn't you he says your soul changed didn't it yes your mind change the way your think change it's of process changing and now it's going to your body and St to work on your body and the change is a we in progress God hallelujah if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead may I say it the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead is now in US amen amen and if that same spirit is now in us his commission is to raise you up Hallelujah no matter how the devr the way you down the tres the spirit of God is Raising you up H the to of you the spirit of God is Raising you up he put you under Financial death pressure and feel so bow down and upon the is nothing can stop the holy ghost from perfecting and completing his mission amen sere God a mighty God in Christ Ting father he coming back again for you he coming back again for you Hallelujah my son he sure that he he's here hallelujah what we come to meet God does your flesh your body come to meet God no spirit with spirit will meet we got a down here we have another one over there [Applause] Hallelujah I feel God hallelujah we come to church because we want to have a meeting but there's going to be a meeting over there a meeting like never have before if be noy let me warn you Shing millions of people shouting together why because they're seeing the same thing hallelujah amen because you're see what I'm see hallelujah oh if you could only stand on the rock where Moses stood because if you stand there you're going to see what he saw if you stand on the Rock revelation of you want to see what you need a vision to see what he saw you just need a need a revelation from God to see what he saw brother God we need rapturing faith and that's what we preaching here we are preaching the rapturing faith this is the faith that going to take the people out and they can get the revelation of the word of God listen we don't know what those Mysteries are yet back then he's speaking but in my my opinion they're about to be revealed right away glory to God hallelujah and when they do it will give fit for rapturing Grace for the Church of the Living God hallelujah and so we are in the season now what back then it was prophecy now we are the prophecy we are the Fulfillment of the prophecy and we're walking in the prophecy many of us our parents was in this message my mother and father God blessed his soul I baptized him in water in the name of the Lord when I was just about 18 years old glory to God many other sitting in here their mothers and their fathers were in this message Hallelujah they didn't come this far up to catch all this Revelation but we going to me that over why because the standing out on the right message going to the right direction as long as they D going in that direction they're going to end up in the right place Hallelujah they don't need the rest of it to make it but the B says once they CAU Luther's justification the genuine ones that's it the veil is already ripped Hallelujah he says that wash woman she just needs one Revelation amen that is enough to take her opens the door brings you into the presence of Mighty God and then he reveals to each one how much he wants to reveal he might reveal more to a preacher might reveal he says you know little F great F much F he shows that that happens that that's the way it is in the P presence of God so don't you start mourning because oh I don't know as much as brother Mike no each one is individual and God will reveal something different to you Hallelujah God gives us Ace separately as he will every one of us here is gifted is that right at least you got gift your life so gift I'm On Top give you all gifts God hallelujah so you're a gifted person God you're not just ordinary person but you're gifted in the grace of God Amen we just move through all of them others and everything and through all of them other dispensations we've watched everything we have seen the mysteries of God we have seen the appearing of the great Gathering together of the bright happening in these last days you believe it's happening it's still happening but he was around he said is happening because that what come out of him was the voice amen and the shout amen it was coming out at that time calling a bride together back then was to come out of the denomination amen as a organization but now the voice went higher and it's calling out all the organization spirit amen is that right you don't need to be in an organization for it to still call but it pull you out of oranization of spirit and then the spirit of God is still calling out is bringing up people from out of this Mass Ed this age of mass that we living in you won't believe it but everybody God we in the message that's wonderful but that's just the ne that was C in the sea and caught all kind of crabs and Snak and spider and frog and everything come within the neck of that message but then said the Fisher is going to put his hand and begin to pick out the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] rain the ho G Mar with the seven of redemption more people praise God why because God them oh he's picking out the rainbow trout one by one and I'm glad that I can say I'm I'm I'm one because you know us people we don't like to eat dead fish you know too much we live in the North so we got to eat ice fish but we love to see the living jumping fish right when you throw the fish on land you can't stand in the do PR stuff that's why I be here way I do [Applause] something to God I wish I could dance but I never had I never the chance first of all because I got born again early you know but I wish when I see some of these guys make some moves I I I can J brother just praise the Lord if I just SL across this floor in front of you [Applause] here sometimes you're so happy you don't know how to express yourself you wish you had some some things you could do amen praise God hallelujah oh man glory to God hallelujah I even talk about it maybe I should go take some lessons God but my God something just got a hold of me amen praise God forever more listen here what he says here that Gathering Together the Bri in this last days but yet the brother being gathered but yet there is something else in there that we can't just Enlighten ourselves with why God said hold it back hold it back and then I reveal it I'll reveal it in that day don't write it all down John because right now there's tagger over it amen Just Let It Go but I will reveal it in the day when they have the reason to see it praise God hallelujah that's in the seven SE page Tre are revealing in the day when they have reason to see hallelujah hallelujah it wasn't their day the day of the other ages they didn't have reason to see or how we see him but we need to see it because the Seven Devils that went and AD Mary Magdalene is now attacking the bride of Christ and the word is start to cast out that every you think I'm just making that up no brother every age a messenger come and there is a principality that opposes that messenger that's sent from the devil just like the God have his messenger the devil has a prince of Prince of power the air that comes to oppose that messenger for that particular age so the seven of them come right now with their opposition right now praise God and in the last day now because they're loose the message is God they're trying to come to possess the Church of the Living God they want to get a hold of Mary be like in the Bible and the Bible says out of who Jesus s he cast out his word same word every day every you I'm a Believer yeah but you can have a SE Spirit on you that's right you going be a believe you got a lying Spirit on you you got a Believer on you and you got a lustful devil that's bothering you right to be a believer it's not no more smoking drinking and all that stuff God is doing spiritual warfare God s conflict of the ages oh praise God hallelujah there's a great God Almighty there's a battle going on the greatest battle ever let's get place now the Holy Spirit you are the object Satan wants to get you but God says no She's [Music] Mine than you Lord to Jesus no I belong to the Lord hallelujah amen praise God that's what this is all about praise God so you ask me why I'm happy I'll tell you the reason why I had a good ghost of the Holy Ghost I didn't just the communion but I got a of the Holy Ghost prise God forever more glory to God Amen yes sir so there where it is now he says now you see he never understood it John never seen exactly what it all was not even John the Revelator didn't see all what we seeing he never understood it but what he saw was what God was sending to the church for this time he just saw what God was sending to this church for this time time but he never seen exactly what it was and he never understood it amen but what he saw was what God was sending to the church for a time now he always does and notice he will make it plain with is when it is time to make it plain and that time is now amen amen oh a lot of people talk all this quot where he says oh I am here I BR the word I'm hitting the I'm just hitting the I'm just hitting the highlights amen but wait till them young man come along amen young man amen young man come along that will take that word and break it down to the people yes sir they going to get another level of revelation it's not going to be on this level but it's going have another level of revelation to take the word and break it down Amen in other words he brought it death amen praise the Lord you're not going to feed your baby when the with the milk that just came out of the cow fresh and thick and it's so thick you got to kind of break it down so that it can go into human consumption praise the Lord hallelujah and that's what he's talking about but people don't have any respect some people don't have no respect for the minister of this the Ministers of this day because they're not the prophet they don't torch has been passed and that Spirit broke itself up and went into a whole bunch of men a little piece little piece there again a little piece little piece there little piece over there and then breaks up when it sees f for his glory and for his and he will make it PL in time and he feels that he wants to make it play I not believe that time is now I think this message has been setting in in the jar and it's being fermenting and dis distilling until you know all the MU come on the top and we able to skim it off and throw it theide and we could see the clear Revelation there do [Music] Glory whatever you call it White Lightning moonshine whatever you call Moonshine [Applause] Soul stimul by Revelation stimulation through Revelation glory to God hallelujah amen yes sir oh my so that Thunder went off see and why because he's going to keep it secret uh until the last days and not the something of the last Angel's message it was to gather up these Mysteries to make it clear Seven Seals page 143 now at the end of that Pentecostal age we are supposed to receive according to the word God help me tonight a messenger that will take all the new STS and reveal the whole secret of God for the rapturing of the church amen hallelujah the secret is right there now to us it look like a simple as plain we can even rle it up with shout you think the people in those denominations really know anything much about that they read it but they don't have no understanding of what they're reading amen they don't have no understanding but but because we in a message we just take these things for granted that oh we know this we know that oh I heard that already I heard this already you know I'm understand that you dealing with jewels you dealing with Rich stuff is that right praise God you know when people get really really really rich the woman will toss all the jewelry like that on the you know on a dresser like if it's just nothing right and those of us who have just a couple thing here and there we want to lock it up and safe everything else because that might be the only one you have TR but you find people like that when they're really
