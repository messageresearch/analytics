[10:05] seated god bless you
[10:08] amen i
[10:11] have so much of my heart
[10:13] amen the word has been so
[10:15] rich and sweet lately amen
[10:20] it's just filling me up and filling me
[10:22] up
[10:22] amen
[10:24] and
[10:24] i just thank god for the opportunity
[10:27] to be here this morning it's
[10:30] i can't get into detail but it's it's
[10:32] supernatural how god just deals with our
[10:35] lives and
[10:36] and places us where we need to be in the
[10:38] time we need to be amen
[10:41] hallelujah
[10:42] there's so much uh
[10:44] so much to
[10:45] say here to this morning but um we're
[10:48] just gonna preach the word and preach a
[10:50] thought this morning and hit it on many
[10:52] different angles
[10:54] amen i'm not gonna preach anything
[10:56] uh different than what you already heard
[10:58] or what you've been hearing but i
[11:00] believe that we're all reflections of
[11:02] the great light amen
[11:04] i mean i believe i believe without the
[11:07] man of god he's our pastor but i call
[11:09] him the man of god because he's first
[11:11] the man of god before he's our pastor
[11:13] amen if that light never came to me
[11:16] through him it would not be reflecting
[11:19] through me amen
[11:20] we can't live any higher than our pastor
[11:23] we can't be any more spiritual than our
[11:25] pastor because it doesn't line up with
[11:26] the word of god because we are just
[11:28] reflections of him amen so i i pray this
[11:32] morning that you will see my portion
[11:35] that is being reflected through me and
[11:37] that you will see your portion of the
[11:39] word of god and for you for your day
[11:42] amen that's reflected through you
[11:44] because that's what that's what perfect
[11:46] faith is that's what the new birth
[11:48] you've got to come to recognize who you
[11:50] are and what you are called for amen
[11:53] it's not to exalt any man no man is
[11:55] being exalted here jesus christ is being
[11:58] lifted on high and being exalted amen
[12:01] hallelujah
[12:03] and and i believe we're we're feeding
[12:06] off present truth
[12:09] present prophecy that's coming forth to
[12:12] the bride of jesus christ because
[12:14] remember she must prophesy again
[12:17] amen
[12:18] my title this morning is the bride knows
[12:21] the interpreter of the word
[12:24] amen the bride knows the interpreter
[12:27] she knows the interpretation of the
[12:29] prophecy
[12:30] that is coming forth and she is starting
[12:33] to recognize where to place the prophecy
[12:36] in her own life in her own position
[12:39] because without that you're lost without
[12:41] that you you're blind you can't see
[12:44] amen it's not believing we're going to
[12:46] see without just believing in the past
[12:49] here amen i believe god sent a prophet
[12:52] 100
[12:53] and the ministry here believes god sent
[12:56] a prophet
[12:57] but the prophet came eliezer to
[13:00] introduce the bride amen
[13:04] to jesus christ
[13:07] amen that's what that what the purpose
[13:09] was for
[13:10] amen not to not to to rely on the past
[13:13] but look what god is doing today
[13:17] amen i can't be i can't come into my
[13:20] full manifestation and be who i am if
[13:23] i'm looking back there at his portion
[13:27] i believe his light reflected down here
[13:29] to this age amen i believe the light of
[13:32] the prophet came through the prophet
[13:34] because the word comes to the prophet it
[13:36] came to our pastor amen it came to the
[13:39] ministry here and it come through him to
[13:41] come to me and come to you
[13:44] and that's where we are this morning
[13:47] hallelujah
[13:49] i believe the bride
[13:51] is at a place of maturity
[13:54] amen
[13:55] i believe the bride is at that place of
[13:58] maturity this morning
[14:00] that that that uh
[14:02] you know she's not deceived
[14:05] by denominations out there
[14:08] she's not deceived by all the
[14:10] denominations 300 000 or whatever that
[14:13] they are all they claim to have the
[14:15] truth the way the light
[14:17] they're not to see the bride's not
[14:18] deceived by that
[14:20] because she's coming into such a
[14:22] maturity she knows but remember the
[14:24] scriptures what the scripture says
[14:27] it'll be so close if it were possible it
[14:32] would deceive the very elect
[14:34] so where is that so close lying this
[14:38] morning
[14:40] we've been hearing being preached but
[14:42] i'm just going to preach it over again
[14:46] let us turn to ii peter 1 19. we've got
[14:49] three scriptures reading here
[14:52] hallelujah
[15:02] hallelujah
[15:07] thank you father
[15:10] ii peter 1 19-21
[15:13] we have also a more sure word of
[15:16] prophecy
[15:17] where unto ye do well
[15:20] that ye take heed
[15:22] as unto the light that shineth in a dark
[15:25] place
[15:26] until the day dawn and the day star
[15:29] arise in your hearts
[15:31] knowing this first that no prophecy of
[15:34] the scripture is of any private
[15:36] interpretation
[15:38] for the prophecy came not in old times
[15:42] by the will of man
[15:44] amen
[15:46] but holy men
[15:48] of god spake
[15:50] as they were moved by the holy ghost
[15:54] there it is today
[15:56] that's not just past there that's today
[15:58] i see that scripture being fulfilled in
[16:01] our midst
[16:02] you know when jesus was standing there
[16:04] and he was declaring amen when he was in
[16:07] the temple he was declaring this is the
[16:09] day of salvation this is the day of
[16:11] deliverance tonight and they all the
[16:13] people were sitting there amazed at the
[16:15] law that was being spoken
[16:17] but when jesus stood up and said
[16:19] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[16:22] your eyes then they look to say what is
[16:24] this
[16:26] what is this
[16:33] romans 8 27.
[16:38] and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[16:40] what's in the mind of the spirit
[16:42] because he make it intercession
[16:46] for the saints according to the will of
[16:47] god
[16:48] and we know that all things work
[16:50] together for good to them that love god
[16:53] to them who are called according to his
[16:55] purpose
[16:57] for whom he did for noah he also
[16:59] predestinated to to be conformed to the
[17:03] image of his son
[17:05] that he might be the firstborn amongst
[17:07] many brethren
[17:08] moreover moreover whom he did
[17:11] predestinate them he also called and
[17:14] them he called he also justified and
[17:18] whom he justified them he also glorified
[17:23] what shall we say
[17:25] then to these things
[17:27] if god before us
[17:29] who can be against us revelations 19
[17:34] 10
[17:35] a quick scripture here
[17:41] and i fell at his feet to worship him
[17:46] and he said unto me
[17:48] see thou do it not
[17:51] many mistakes are happening today in the
[17:54] message
[17:55] with that
[17:58] interpret the scripture it wasn't they
[18:01] felt at jesus's feet
[18:04] see thou do it not
[18:06] i am thy fellow servant
[18:09] and of thy brethren
[18:11] that have the testimony of jesus
[18:14] worship god
[18:16] for the testimony of jesus
[18:19] is the spirit
[18:20] of prophecy amen thank you lord
[18:24] father bless your word
[18:26] it is blessed father bless your people
[18:29] give us ears to hear
[18:32] give us eyes the sea lord

[18:38] fulfill your word according to your
[18:39] prophecies lord

[18:43] morning as we commit each one into your
[18:45] hands father take every spirit subject
[18:48] to the holy spirit this morning to the
[18:50] word of god this morning
[18:53] put a wall of fire and a hedge around us
[18:55] i bind every spirit of doubt and
[18:57] unbelief father
[18:59] in jesus name we pray amen you may be
[19:01] seated
[19:03] hallelujah
[19:06] amen
[19:10] thank you lord
[19:12] what a day we're living
[19:15] i'm going to take a lot of quotes this
[19:17] morning and
[19:18] a lot of scripture this morning and read
[19:21] amen
[19:22] and and try to
[19:24] just bring
[19:25] what god wants to be brought out
[19:27] this thought this morning
[19:30] i know i was preparing this message uh
[19:33] five six weeks ago
[19:35] on god god struck my heart about god as
[19:38] his own interpreter
[19:39] and then i think a week or so later i
[19:42] was i was laughing because the holy
[19:43] spirit brother simon started preaching
[19:45] on it and i was looking through all my
[19:47] notes and it was like lining up
[19:49] and i said oh my
[19:50] i said uh the the the mess has already
[19:53] been preached
[19:54] and and then a brother came to me says
[19:56] no no brother
[19:58] and it's true he says god gave you that
[20:00] message because you are a different
[20:03] reflection of the of the light
[20:05] on on a different angle
[20:07] that we all bring something different
[20:11] so this morning
[20:13] hallelujah we are living in a day
[20:15] of confusion
[20:18] we are living in a day where men and
[20:20] women hardly know what to do
[20:22] everything seems in turmoil
[20:25] everything seems to be
[20:27] sold so many different ways to look
[20:30] satan is doing that
[20:32] amen we can we can see that today
[20:35] that that
[20:36] if he's talking back then
[20:38] the world and and everybody was in
[20:41] turmoil
[20:43] what what about today
[20:45] what about the condition of the people's
[20:46] minds today
[20:48] the conditions of the people's hearts
[20:50] today
[20:51] where they where the bible says that in
[20:53] the last days their hearts will be
[20:56] their conscience would be snare with a
[20:57] hot iron they'll have no conscience
[21:00] anymore
[21:01] we are seeing this manifest in this day
[21:04] and remember prophecy always follows the
[21:07] maturity of the bride
[21:09] amen so we can recognize what day that
[21:12] we are living in
[21:17] we look at we look at the
[21:19] everybody's trying to uh you know
[21:22] cove it everybody's trying to uh
[21:24] interpret covet what's going on with
[21:26] covet why was cole was sent for
[21:28] right
[21:29] ev god has a purpose in everything
[21:32] everything that is happening everything
[21:34] that's taken place is all exactly lined
[21:36] with god god is not confused he's not
[21:39] mixed up with anything he knows exactly
[21:42] what's taken place in the world today
[21:45] and why it has to take place
[21:47] and we need to just rest the bride
[21:49] dresses and trust us in him
[21:51] and what's going on
[21:53] she has in fear
[21:55] amen she's not she's not she's not uh
[21:58] unwise either she's wise in these things
[22:00] right in all the protocols and things
[22:03] that we have to do in our lives is
[22:04] common sense
[22:06] god gave us common sense we know that
[22:07] there's not much common sense left out
[22:09] there but i believe the bride of jesus
[22:11] christ has common sense
[22:13] right
[22:15] but we see how things are starting to
[22:17] line up
[22:19] amen you start seeing how you know we
[22:22] we've seen the pieces of the puzzles for
[22:24] many many years how this rapture is
[22:26] going to take place how this new world
[22:28] order how the market of beast is going
[22:29] to come into its power is going to
[22:31] happen many years we've been seeing
[22:34] pieces of the puzzle but i believe those
[22:36] pieces of the puzzle are starting to be
[22:38] clicked in clicked in clicked in the
[22:41] picture is becoming a lot clearer to us
[22:44] and if that picture is becoming a lot
[22:46] clearer to us i believe the picture of
[22:48] the bride of jesus christ and her
[22:50] portion in the word is becoming a lot
[22:52] clearer i believe she's recognizing who
[22:55] she is
[22:57] where her position is
[22:58] in this hour
[23:00] where's her position her position is not
[23:03] in the other court the inner court be
[23:05] behind the veil where the glories never
[23:08] fail
[23:09] there's a kind of glory
[23:11] that's where she's standing
[23:13] that's where she's placed this morning
[23:16] oh my
[23:18] watch out
[23:20] watch out when you start seeing that
[23:21] arise now
[23:23] oh my
[23:25] my my
[23:27] whoa
[23:28] jesus amen
[23:30] thank you lord
[23:32] amen
[23:34] amen the bible teaches us
[23:36] that god is all-knowing omniscience
[23:39] when we say that god is omniscient we
[23:42] mean that he's perfect knowledge in all
[23:44] things
[23:46] he does not have to learn anything
[23:49] and he has not forgotten anything
[23:52] like we do
[23:53] god does not have to reason things out
[23:57] he doesn't have to figure things out or
[23:59] learn them gradually
[24:02] he knows everything
[24:04] that has happened and everything that
[24:07] will happen
[24:08] and god also knows every potential thing
[24:11] that might even happen
[24:13] god even knows those things that
[24:16] humankind has yet to discover
[24:19] his knowledge is the absolute
[24:23] the omniscience of god means that he has
[24:25] perfect knowledge perfect understanding
[24:28] and perfect wisdom as how to apply that
[24:31] knowledge and that is the god i believe
[24:34] in that is the god that i trust this
[24:37] morning to lead and guide my life
[24:40] and to control my life
[24:43] amen that's his characteristics when i
[24:46] approach god into prayer when i believe
[24:48] god for anything this is the god that i
[24:51] believe that knows all things
[24:55] oh my
[24:57] hallelujah
[25:00] to god that's the faith of the bride of
[25:02] jesus christ that's the faith that's
[25:04] rising up in this hour
[25:06] amen that's coming into maturity
[25:08] hallelujah
[25:11] hallelujah
[25:14] all god's word
[25:16] is written by inspiration
[25:19] brother branham speaking here in the law
[25:21] having a shadow
[25:23] there's not a contradiction in the
[25:25] entire bible
[25:27] if there is i want to see it
[25:30] it's nothing in there
[25:32] it's written that cannot there's nothing
[25:34] written that cannot be straightened out
[25:36] by the word of god
[25:38] if it's rightly put in its place
[25:42] and that's the problem
[25:44] without faith without revelation without
[25:46] god revealing it and interpreting it to
[25:49] you is not put in this right place
[25:52] and that's man and man has always done
[25:54] it and that's why their religion and and
[25:57] even in the message is in the mess that
[25:59] it's in
[26:01] because they don't let god wait upon god
[26:04] to interpret his word
[26:06] and make it plain to us
[26:08] we always go ahead of god we always try
[26:11] to go ahead but wait on the lord those
[26:13] who wait on god shall renew their
[26:16] strength
[26:17] amen he's the one that's in control
[26:20] i'm not speaking about the bride of
[26:23] jesus christ this morning that she can
[26:24] do anything she want to do she can say
[26:27] anything she wants to say no
[26:29] that's not the revelation she's under
[26:31] the control of the headship
[26:33] she's under control
[26:35] of the leading of the spirit of god
[26:37] within her she says nothing amen unless
[26:40] he gives it to her he puts it in her
[26:43] heart by faith to speak through her lips
[26:46] or she doesn't say nothing at all
[26:49] amen
[26:51] and our life speaks
[26:54] hallelujah
[26:56] but we never do it
[26:58] but we'll never do it by man's
[27:00] interpretation
[27:02] the holy spirit
[27:03] wrote the bible
[27:05] and the vibe and the holy spirit is the
[27:08] only one who can interpret the bible
[27:11] and he'll give it to us
[27:13] listen
[27:14] as we have need
[27:19] hallelujah
[27:21] why are you pulling
[27:23] why are you fearing
[27:25] why you're frightened
[27:26] he'll give it to us as we have need of
[27:28] it
[27:29] he knows exactly what we have need of
[27:31] then he say i'll supply all your needs
[27:34] get out of the car no thinking i you
[27:36] know i'll supply your knees by my my
[27:38] rent money or my this money and my
[27:40] grocery money
[27:42] jesus said
[27:44] you you have little faith to think that
[27:46] way you go don't don't you know that
[27:49] seek the kingdom of god first
[27:51] and his righteousness
[27:54] and all things shall be added freely
[27:56] unto you
[27:58] that means whether you pray about it or
[28:00] not
[28:01] that's up to you but it will be added on
[28:03] to you
[28:04] i want to focus my life my heart amen on
[28:08] the word
[28:10] of god in my life and fulfill what he

[28:54] what a day we're living in
[28:56] we're people
[28:58] what an hour we're living in
[29:00] where people are doing what's right in
[29:01] their own
[29:03] own eyes
[29:07] what's that have to do with us this
[29:09] morning

[29:11] all the spirits
[29:13] that are manifested out there
[29:15] right
[29:16] you have to fight
[29:18] you have to overcome
[29:20] all these spirits out there because
[29:23] whether you like it or not you can't
[29:25] stay in these four walls and all of us
[29:26] together seven days a week
[29:29] you gotta go out there in the world you
[29:30] gotta face the world
[29:32] amen
[29:33] and the spirits that are out there
[29:36] and judges 17 6
[29:38] in those days there was no king in
[29:40] israel but every man did what was right
[29:43] in their own eyes
[29:44] proverbs 21 2
[29:47] every way of man is right in his own
[29:49] eyes but the lord pondereth the hearts
[29:52] at which was right in his own eyes
[29:55] proverbs 16 2
[29:57] all the ways of men
[29:59] are clean in his own eyes
[30:02] but the lord weigheth the spirits
[30:05] second timothy 3 1 it says
[30:08] this no also in the last days previous
[30:13] prayers times shall come for man shall
[30:15] be lovers of their own cells covenants
[30:17] bolsters proud blasphemers disobedient
[30:20] to parents unthankful unholy without
[30:23] natural affections truth breakers false
[30:25] accusers incontinence spice spice
[30:29] despisers of those that are good
[30:31] traitors heady high-minded lovers of
[30:33] pleasure
[30:35] more than lovers of god
[30:39] that's them out there not the bride of
[30:41] jesus christ
[30:43] to be lovers of pleasures more than
[30:45] lovers of god
[30:49] having a form
[30:51] of godliness
[30:52] but denying the power thereof from such
[30:55] turn away so here he is talking about
[30:58] all the spirits that are manifested on
[31:00] the sinners out there
[31:02] and then right at the end he says having
[31:05] a form of godliness but denying the very
[31:08] power thereof
[31:10] oh my
[31:12] from such turn away
[31:16] listen this morning
[31:19] hallelujah
[31:21] when man leads their own life
[31:23] with their own wisdom and knowledge
[31:26] and you try to interpret things your own
[31:28] way it misleads them off the path of
[31:32] life
[31:34] people today say they don't want
[31:36] religion
[31:37] they want to be spiritual
[31:40] you know that's a great movement out
[31:42] there
[31:43] they don't want religion they don't want
[31:45] they want to be spiritual
[31:47] listen that spirit is here in the
[31:50] message too
[31:51] they don't want religion because they
[31:52] don't want to come to a church they
[31:54] don't want to be subject to a pastor
[31:56] they don't want to be subject to elders
[31:59] and you know but they want to be
[32:01] spiritual
[32:04] what a spirit
[32:07] themselves they want to lead themselves
[32:10] but look at how that is turning out
[32:13] look at society look at families
[32:15] governments look at all the churches
[32:18] look at all the walks of life and see
[32:21] where man leaves themselves doesn't the
[32:23] bible say that man will destroy the
[32:25] world again
[32:27] and job 21 13 they spent their days in
[32:30] wealth
[32:31] and in a moment down to the grave
[32:35] therefore they say unto god depart from
[32:37] us
[32:38] for we desire not the knowledge of thy
[32:41] ways
[32:43] listen this is an hour of complete
[32:45] surrender to his ways

[32:55] us into that kind of life

[33:02] if it's not drawing you closer amen and
[33:06] drawing you in

[33:10] god you get more separated from this
[33:13] flesh and this life
[33:17] and you overcome
[33:18] the weaknesses in our lives
[33:21] amen

[39:43] oh my
[39:45] oh hallelujah
[39:48] oh fulfilling
[39:50] the rapture age we live in now
[39:53] when we get ourselves all settled down
[39:55] in things and we think we got it all
[39:57] made and our traditions all wrapped up
[39:59] listen i'm not talking the denominations
[40:01] out here i'm talking here
[40:03] remember so close to deceive the very
[40:05] elect i'm talking right here
[40:08] amen this is not for uh a day you know
[40:12] he preached against and and going beyond
[40:14] the camp he hit that spirit of
[40:16] denomination in every way go listen to
[40:18] that message but let me tell you that
[40:21] spirit is still alive spirits spirits
[40:24] don't die people die who operate those
[40:26] spirits but they don't die that's right
[40:29] oh my
[40:33] i thank god for
[40:37] and then let me boast i thank god for
[40:39] what we got here
[40:41] i thank god
[40:43] because i i tell you
[40:45] i would be deceived
[40:46] it's so close
[40:48] it's so religious
[40:50] it's so right you're taking the message
[40:52] and the quotes and everything oh my
[40:56] oh my
[40:59] but we're moving on
[41:01] search the scriptures
[41:04] and see
[41:05] what is promised
[41:07] and prophesied for this day
[41:10] see what the message has prophesied
[41:12] to the bride of jesus christ see what
[41:15] she has to fulfill
[41:17] see how she will be walking with him and
[41:20] her relationship to him
[41:23] and see where we're at today
[41:30] then we'll know where we're at
[41:33] when we can tell where we're standing
[41:35] that's the problem most people don't
[41:37] know where they're standing
[41:39] they don't know where they're at today
[41:42] oh i got the message i got the quotes i
[41:44] can do all this i can i don't mean
[41:46] nothing won't mean you're standing on
[41:48] anything
[41:49] unless you're standing jesus said i
[41:51] built the church upon revelation
[41:53] that is the rock that i built it upon
[41:55] unless you're standing on that rock
[41:57] revelation this morning of the word of
[41:59] god being interpreted for your day to
[42:01] you
[42:03] recognizing the prophecies that are
[42:04] being fulfilled today not yesterday
[42:08] i recognized the prophecies of the
[42:10] prophet for yesterday i recognize i
[42:12] thank god but i know because that is
[42:14] fulfilled there is something here today
[42:17] there's something for me here today
[42:20] amen
[42:27] thank you lord
[42:31] come on
[42:33] zeku said there's three different types
[42:35] of believers in every church
[42:37] make believer unbeliever
[42:41] and a real believer
[42:43] you know i don't know i can't i can't
[42:45] interpret i'm not here to interpret
[42:48] when that door is going to close
[42:52] but that door is closed and i know that
[42:54] for sure like i can tell by my my
[42:56] spiritual eyes what i can see that door
[42:58] is closing
[43:00] but when it does close it will interpret
[43:02] itself
[43:03] because then the fullness of the
[43:05] preaching to the loss
[43:07] will be manifested and nobody else will
[43:09] come into this
[43:10] revelation everybody else will be left
[43:13] back out
[43:15] and be foolish
[43:16] and be called foolish virgins
[43:19] foolish with the word of god
[43:21] and i i you know we know that that that
[43:23] is just what the word of god is we can't
[43:26] change that i know i i speak and i
[43:28] preach it because it says it that but we
[43:29] all know it's by predestination like we
[43:31] read in the scriptures by election that
[43:34] this comes to pass
[43:36] amen
[43:38] there are many camps
[43:41] there are always been camps
[43:44] in jesus day there was a lot of camps
[43:47] the pharisees and sadducees
[43:49] in every age there was religious camps
[43:52] formed to try to interpret the word
[43:57] hallelujah
[44:00] what were the camps in jesus day
[44:03] that came against him
[44:05] what did they say
[44:07] what did the pharisees were what were
[44:09] the pharisees doing they were they were
[44:12] keeping the law of moses weren't they
[44:15] they were
[44:16] they were so precise but by keeping that
[44:21] law and not having revelation amen they
[44:25] they they created traditions they they
[44:27] created their own interpretation how
[44:29] messiah would come
[44:31] they started getting a delusion in their
[44:34] minds
[44:35] and and that delusion started
[44:37] interpreting the scriptures the law for
[44:40] the day it started mixing everything up
[44:43] of how jesus christ would come to the
[44:46] earth and they and the scriptures were
[44:48] plain to see before them for behold the
[44:51] virgin shall conceive he shall come
[44:54] you know all the scriptures pertaining
[44:56] that were prophesied of jesus they were
[44:58] in a delusion they couldn't see it
[45:03] because they were looking back at the
[45:05] law and they even said to jesus you know
[45:08] who who
[45:09] are you joseph and mary's son are you a
[45:12] carpenter
[45:13] you see the delusion
[45:18] who gave you this authority
[45:21] who gave you this teaching
[45:24] they said we we we are moses disciples
[45:28] we know where we stand
[45:31] we know what we believe
[45:33] we're moses disciples
[45:37] oh my
[45:40] i said i believe god's not a prophet
[45:43] but i ain't
[45:45] brother brown's disciple
[45:47] no no no
[45:50] i'm jesus christ disciple
[45:53] amen
[45:54] but that was the delusion of that
[45:58] day then came after jesus the pagan rome
[46:01] denominations killed the word again
[46:03] amongst the people so they couldn't get
[46:06] faith to overcome
[46:08] then god sent reformers then he sent a
[46:10] prophet to the end to restore back again
[46:13] so that church can receive the holy
[46:15] ghost that took in life again
[46:18] but in the same thing is happening today
[46:22] in the message the same spirit that the
[46:25] prophet hid amongst the churches again
[46:28] deceiving people away from the revealed
[46:31] word of this hour
[46:32] so they cannot you know they can't
[46:35] receive it they can't come in jesus said
[46:37] you pharisees and sadducees be you dead
[46:41] man bones inside
[46:44] amen you can't come in so you don't let
[46:47] anybody else in
[46:50] and there's people here today i believe
[46:52] there's a few men of god that are
[46:54] speaking the word of god in this message
[46:56] but most of them are dead man bones amen
[47:00] they don't go in themselves they can't
[47:02] go in and they keep everybody else
[47:05] under the law
[47:06] under tradition
[47:08] oh you're saved you believe moses is law
[47:11] you're saved you believe the message of
[47:13] the hour you're saved you're going to
[47:15] heaven you're going in the rapture but
[47:17] no vindication
[47:19] no revelation
[47:20] no interpretation by the holy ghost
[47:23] himself in their lives
[47:25] no token life being on display no token
[47:28] life manifesting out of their lives
[47:33] dead
[47:36] hallelujah
[47:39] what an hour
[47:42] bless
[47:43] blessed be
[47:45] you
[47:46] bride of jesus christ
[47:49] you're blessed this morning
[47:52] without faith no understanding of the
[47:54] spirit
[47:55] and the prophet's message bringing
[47:57] people under a delusion in this day
[48:00] thinking that they're saved
[48:02] but have no birth no token no life
[48:05] these preachers can't go in so they
[48:07] don't let anybody else in
[48:09] the bride has been given a promise
[48:12] that it would be so close
[48:14] but you see
[48:17] the bride knows her husband
[48:20] and getting to know him very well
[48:23] as he reveals himself to her
[48:25] they share secrets all the time
[48:28] jesus said i show you things to come
[48:31] and it's given to you to know the
[48:32] mysteries of the token life
[48:35] but it's not given to them
[48:37] hallelujah
[48:38] what's the matter
[48:40] what's the matter with the age
[48:42] in every age the word of god is foreign
[48:45] to the people it's un it's too unusual
[48:49] god always does things in unusual ways
[48:52] it's unusual anyway god is
[48:55] is against the systematic of the world
[48:58] because they have gotten things
[49:01] the way that they think it should be
[49:05] god comes and he does the unusual
[49:09] that's the way it is today my brothers
[49:11] and sisters the way the words being
[49:13] listen let me tell you something the way
[49:16] the words being preached here in this
[49:18] ministry under this anointing of this
[49:20] hour
[49:21] which i believe is present truth ah it's
[49:24] unusual to a lot of people
[49:26] oh yeah it's unusual what what in the
[49:29] world is that
[49:30] amen well where did the prophet say that
[49:34] where do you find out i've had i've had
[49:36] it said to me amen what are you going to
[49:38] do argue with them debate with them
[49:42] amen it's like jesus said amen how can
[49:45] brother brown went to the person how you
[49:47] know what i smite your blind he said how
[49:49] can i split spite me by he says he said
[49:51] how can i sweat you blind when you're
[49:52] already blind
[49:54] blind leading the blind
[49:56] blind laocia
[49:58] the prophet cried out in the spirit
[50:01] blind laocia
[50:03] blindness coming not only out in the

[55:32] people who claim to know the way and
[55:34] know the scriptures and all the quotes
[55:36] and can tie them together
[55:38] and make you think you know nothing that
[55:41] only
[55:42] that only they know the way
[55:45] yes
[55:46] so many camps just like the pharisees

[56:08] desire and prayer to god for israel that
[56:11] they might be saved for i bear the
[56:14] record that they have a zeal of god
[56:17] but not according to knowledge
[56:20] for they being ignorant of god's
[56:22] righteousness
[56:23] and going about to establish their own
[56:26] righteousness have not submitted
[56:28] themselves to the righteousness of god
[56:32] today
[56:34] this scripture is fulfilled
[56:37] matthew 16 17 and jesus answered and
[56:40] said unto them blessed thou simon blair
[56:42] jonah flesh and blood has not revealed
[56:45] it to you
[56:46] upon this rock i will build my church
[56:49] and the gates of hell
[56:51] shall not prevail against it
[56:54] now i give you the keys
[56:57] of of the kingdom of heaven
[57:00] and whatsoever thou shalt bind shall be
[57:03] bound in earth whatever thou shall loose
[57:05] shall be loosed in heaven
[57:07] we have those keys that key of faith the
[57:10] key of david this morning the key of
[57:12] revelation
[57:14] to start binding
[57:16] amen where
[57:18] brother brown says you speak the word
[57:20] and create the world your own world and
[57:22] you go live on it what world is he
[57:25] talking about
[57:27] that world of uh that token life world
[57:31] that world that life that walks behind
[57:33] the inner veil
[57:35] amen
[57:36] and you speak that word of god
[57:39] in your life you speak to areas you bind
[57:42] them and you believe
[57:44] amen
[57:45] hallelujah
[57:47] so that they may loose
[57:50] but while a true believer is the
[57:52] revelation of god being revealed
[57:55] in the age we're living in
[57:57] my words are spirit and life
[58:00] it's god in word form and can only be
[58:04] interpreted by himself the human mind
[58:06] cannot comprehend and interpret god's
[58:08] mind
[58:09] how can a little human mind interpret
[58:12] the infinite mind
[58:14] when we can even interpret one another's
[58:17] mind
[58:18] and notice to whom he revealed it and he
[58:22] also designed that he can hide himself
[58:25] in the scriptures
[58:27] to the smartest theologian there is
[58:30] he can just hide himself set right there
[58:33] in the scriptures and you look all day
[58:36] long
[58:36] and never see it
[58:39] look a lifetime
[58:40] and never see it
[58:42] he can just hide himself sitting there
[58:45] now please everywheres let this soak in
[58:49] that god in the word can hide himself so
[58:52] in the word that there isn't a
[58:55] theologian or school in the world that
[58:58] could ever find him there yet he is
[59:01] sitting right there
[59:07] this day this scripture is fulfilled
[59:11] hallelujah
[59:13] brother bran was speaking here the
[59:14] importance of revelation to a true
[59:16] believer
[59:18] it's everything we know that
[59:20] everything
[59:22] in him was attributes
[59:24] it was the attributes to be god he was
[59:27] attribute he had attributes to be father
[59:29] son
[59:30] savior healer
[59:32] all these attributes were in him
[59:35] these things that has unfolded since the
[59:37] beginning of time are just his
[59:39] attributes being made manifest
[59:41] what i
[59:42] what i mean attributes was his thoughts
[59:45] a word
[59:46] expressed is his thoughts
[59:49] and now remember
[59:51] you christians you were in his thoughts
[59:53] before
[59:54] the world was
[59:57] my my
[59:59] my what's taking place here
[1:00:02] and you are the manifestation of his
[1:00:04] thinking
[1:00:05] that makes you his subjects
[1:00:07] and the whole thing is god himself
[1:00:10] materializing himself tangible so that
[1:00:13] he could be handled
[1:00:15] seen
[1:00:16] and known by his bride
[1:00:19] i was speaking here not long ago in a
[1:00:21] meeting and somebody said to me brother
[1:00:24] branham you have the wrong
[1:00:25] interpretation you don't interpret that
[1:00:28] right
[1:00:29] now you go to the methodists and they
[1:00:31] say the baptists don't interpret it
[1:00:33] right you go to the baptist and the
[1:00:34] pentecostals don't interpret a right you
[1:00:36] go to the pentecostals they say the
[1:00:38] oneness don't it the one to say the
[1:00:40] assemblies don't each of them say they
[1:00:43] don't
[1:00:44] but god is his own interpreter he don't
[1:00:47] need anybody to interpret him
[1:00:50] how can we interpret him
[1:00:54] think about it
[1:00:57] the the you know when your eyes are open
[1:01:00] to see how can
[1:01:02] how can we interpret god

[1:01:09] hands
[1:01:10] you know brother i'm seeing that serpent
[1:01:12] and he tried to cut the head off that
[1:01:15] serpent but he's seen that serpent
[1:01:16] sneaking in that spirit of denomination
[1:01:19] that spirit of man sneaking into the
[1:01:21] message amen
[1:01:23] man trying to interpret
[1:01:27] god will make his word plain
[1:01:30] he always makes his word plain
[1:01:33] he always will confirm his word
[1:01:36] by manifesting his word
[1:01:39] look for the manifestation
[1:01:41] look for the vindication
[1:01:43] to build your faith my brothers and
[1:01:45] sisters look in the scriptures and see
[1:01:49] what has been spoken
[1:01:51] what you've been hearing

[1:01:56] what is going to give you faith and
[1:01:57] perfect faith and let your faith grow is
[1:02:00] when you can identify what's being
[1:02:02] spoken and god interpreted it bringing
[1:02:05] it to pass

[1:02:10] amen
[1:02:12] hallelujah

[1:02:40] the word of faith in us
[1:02:43] you see there's a human part of us
[1:02:46] which is most of us and then there's a
[1:02:47] god part of us
[1:02:48] you see the fullness of the godhead
[1:02:50] dwelt in jesus christ
[1:02:52] he didn't bypass his theophany amen
[1:02:57] he was the fullness of god
[1:03:00] yes he was human but not sinful human
[1:03:02] like we are
[1:03:04] but we are sinful human there's a part
[1:03:06] of us that are still sinful human which
[1:03:08] we preach we call the flesh but also
[1:03:12] don't emphasize on that
[1:03:15] there's a god part of us
[1:03:17] there's a faith part of us inside

[1:11:18] shekinah glory is and the world is shut
[1:11:21] out of her heart is shut out of her mind

[1:16:22] that

[1:16:28] that wasn't it
[1:16:31] that wasn't it

[1:16:40] we can come and sit and agree with the
[1:16:42] word and everything else
[1:16:44] but don't have that token what good does
[1:16:47] it do
[1:16:48] no good
[1:16:50] get beneath it
[1:16:52] it was not responsible for anyone out of
[1:16:55] under the blood
[1:16:56] and he
[1:16:58] is not responsible for anybody today
[1:17:01] out from under the token
[1:17:04] the whole family is only safe when you
[1:17:06] get under the token
[1:17:08] and the token was displayed
[1:17:12] the entire family do you believe that
[1:17:15] today we ought to remember that people
[1:17:18] get under the blood get the token on
[1:17:21] display
[1:17:22] and even our children
[1:17:24] speaking in the token message
[1:17:28] hallelujah
[1:17:32] glory to god
[1:17:37] the answer lies in the position of the
[1:17:40] key
[1:17:44] got two pages left
[1:17:50] almost done
[1:17:53] lies in the position of the key
[1:17:55] it's not in his hand
[1:17:57] is not worn around his neck
[1:17:59] it's not
[1:18:01] it's not placed in his hand or an other
[1:18:04] man's hands
[1:18:06] or the verse could not be saying
[1:18:09] that he alone has the key of
[1:18:11] has the key
[1:18:13] for he alone opens and shuts and no man
[1:18:16] opens
[1:18:18] has the right no man has the right but
[1:18:20] jesus himself isn't that right
[1:18:22] but where is the key
[1:18:24] is on his shoulders
[1:18:27] but what does shoulders have to do with
[1:18:29] it
[1:18:30] read isaiah 9 6 and the government shall
[1:18:32] be upon his shoulders
[1:18:34] but what does this mean
[1:18:36] the answer is this the phrase government
[1:18:39] upon his shoulder comes from the wedding
[1:18:42] ceremony of the east
[1:18:44] when the bride has been committed to the
[1:18:46] groom
[1:18:47] she takes off her veil
[1:18:50] and places it over the groom's shoulder
[1:18:54] signifying that not only is she under
[1:18:57] his dominion
[1:18:59] that she has transferred
[1:19:01] her rights to him
[1:19:04] that he is head
[1:19:07] but also that he bears
[1:19:10] the responsibility and care
[1:19:13] and that he and he alone no one else no
[1:19:17] other man no other power has any right
[1:19:21] or responsibility
[1:19:22] to that beloved
[1:19:24] is the key of david
[1:19:27] god being sovereign for knew by his
[1:19:30] divine exactly who would be in his bride
[1:19:33] he chose her he did not she did not
[1:19:35] choose him
[1:19:37] he called her
[1:19:38] she did not come on her own
[1:19:41] he died for her he washed her in his
[1:19:44] blood he paid the price for her she
[1:19:46] belongs to him and him alone
[1:19:48] she is wholly committed to him and he
[1:19:51] accepts the obligation
[1:19:53] he is her head for christ is the head of
[1:19:56] the church as sarah called abraham lord
[1:19:58] even so the bride is happy
[1:20:01] to be
[1:20:02] lord call him lord
[1:20:06] he speaks and she obeys
[1:20:08] for that is her delight
[1:20:12] now he has cried out in the last age
[1:20:17] you have the word
[1:20:19] you have more bibles than ever
[1:20:22] but
[1:20:23] you are not doing anything except
[1:20:25] dividing and hacking it into pieces
[1:20:29] taking what you want and leaving out
[1:20:33] what you don't want
[1:20:36] you are not interested in the
[1:20:38] living it
[1:20:40] but debating it
[1:20:43] that's over for the bribe
[1:20:45] that's over
[1:20:47] she doesn't walk there anymore
[1:20:51] other people walk there but she doesn't
[1:20:52] walk there
[1:20:54] hallelujah
[1:20:56] the people who took revelation from god
[1:20:59] became the living epistles read of all
[1:21:01] men
[1:21:01] all men in their generation there it is
[1:21:04] again another people in the land under
[1:21:07] their their message
[1:21:08] their eternal message
[1:21:10] will be the final voice in the final age
[1:21:14] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[1:21:16] of god now let me tell you something my
[1:21:18] brothers and sisters
[1:21:22] i'm just that's just me
[1:21:25] right
[1:21:27] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[1:21:29] of god
[1:21:31] the message
[1:21:32] is no longer
[1:21:34] the mouthpiece of god
[1:21:36] no more
[1:21:38] wow
[1:21:39] okay let's read
[1:21:42] it is its own mouthpiece
[1:21:46] so god is turning on it
[1:21:50] he will speak through the prophet
[1:21:53] and the
[1:21:54] bride for the voice of god will be
[1:21:59] in the bride
[1:22:01] yes it is for this i say in the last
[1:22:05] chapter of revelation
[1:22:06] verse 17 the spirit and the bride
[1:22:11] the spirit and the bride in this day say
[1:22:15] come
[1:22:17] once more the world will hear directly
[1:22:20] from god
[1:22:21] through the bride of jesus christ
[1:22:24] let us stand musicians come
[1:22:27] hallelujah
[1:22:29] glory to god
[1:22:31] thank you lord jesus
[1:22:34] they want a great awakening they're
[1:22:36] crying believing there will there will
[1:22:38] be a great awakening there are good
[1:22:40] people in the message
[1:22:42] but they have not recognized the
[1:22:43] awakening of the bride
[1:22:46] being a christian they feel the pull of
[1:22:48] the hour but they haven't recognized
[1:22:51] what's been done
[1:22:52] that's what's making them feel that way
[1:22:55] they know something is supposed to
[1:22:57] happen but they see they're looking for
[1:22:59] it way off in the future
[1:23:03] to come
[1:23:04] when it's already happening right now
[1:23:07] before you
[1:23:08] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:23:10] your ears
[1:23:12] hallelujah
[1:23:14] the bride has been chosen
[1:23:16] it's getting her ready now
[1:23:18] the revival is over
[1:23:21] there's no more revival spirit
[1:23:23] two hours of service everybody's
[1:23:25] complaining and so there's just gleaning
[1:23:29] abraham had
[1:23:31] to sweat it out
[1:23:33] until he found character
[1:23:35] that's what the
[1:23:36] spirit of god is doing now
[1:23:37] and when he found character the next
[1:23:40] thing was prepare her to meet the
[1:23:41] bridegroom you remember when he found
[1:23:44] her in the evening time the evening
[1:23:46] light
[1:23:47] but the spiritual royal seed of abraham
[1:23:50] which believes every word of god there
[1:23:53] is a confirmation of a living
[1:23:55] resurrected jesus christ in them
[1:23:59] the church goes on through the
[1:24:00] tribulation
[1:24:02] period
[1:24:03] but not the bride
[1:24:05] the message goes on through the
[1:24:06] tribulation period
[1:24:08] but not the bride wow listen this isn't
[1:24:11] an hour this isn't an hour i know where

[1:24:17] amen let god be his own interpreter let
[1:24:20] god discern in the thoughts and intense
[1:24:23] discern the spirits of the day we need

[1:24:31] to her the bride of jesus christ to
[1:24:33] discern the word just like jesus

[1:24:57] behind him shutting off the things of
[1:24:59] the world he's in the presence of god
[1:25:01] eating manna
[1:25:02] what a beautiful picture it is today
[1:25:05] of a consecrated life who has entered
[1:25:07] into christ dead to the things of the
[1:25:09] world hid away with god that veil drops
[1:25:13] down around
[1:25:15] her

[1:25:18] there's where the shekinah glory where
[1:25:20] the light that halo
[1:25:23] that ball of fire
[1:25:25] that comes in behind the altar
[1:25:28] and went down and settled on the mercy
[1:25:31] seat where the blood was
[1:25:33] there and there that light lit up
