[0:22] spirit have flow have remnance and bless
[0:25] everyone here father oh I pray in the
[0:28] name of Jesus no one need the same but
[0:32] you draw them Father closer to yourself
[0:36] in Jesus name amen please be
[0:45] seated
[0:47] hallelujah amen so if I will title this
[0:52] I'll title it to be
[0:56] um Victory after trials or trials before
[1:01] Victory and in every
[1:05] life especially become a Christian you
[1:09] go through
[1:10] trials because a Christian work is not a
[1:13] flowy bed of Peace you have your trials
[1:17] I have my
[1:18] trials but the thing of it is when you
[1:22] get into any
[1:24] trials you as a Christian as individual
[1:28] you have to search
[1:30] your heart and find out why you have
[1:35] been in that situation of your life why
[1:39] am I in this
[1:41] trial there are so many reasons why we
[1:44] get ourselves into
[1:45] trials but I'm going to talk only about
[1:48] three of them and the one that I focus
[1:53] on is the third one mostly but the first
[1:56] one
[1:58] is some trials we go through we bring it
[2:03] upon
[2:04] ourselves it's because of our own
[2:07] unbelief our own doing it gets us into a
[2:11] place that brings some trials and
[2:13] tribulations in our life that it
[2:16] shouldn't have been the first place is
[2:18] because of our own doing that's why the
[2:22] scripture said let a man examine himself
[2:25] if he is in the faith the Bible tell to
[2:28] examine someone
[2:30] examine your own self and see because
[2:35] you have to be praying not
[2:38] um daily but you have to be praying even
[2:41] hour every time you have to be in the
[2:44] presence of God when you get out from
[2:46] the presence of God and you get your
[2:49] eyes and your your objectiv shifted so
[2:54] so long a time sometimes most of the
[2:57] time we get ourselves in trouble so so
[3:00] it's your own doing that bring some
[3:03] trials and persecutions in your
[3:06] life and when you become a Christian is
[3:11] a very um critical you got to watch your
[3:15] work you got to watch what you doing
[3:19] because as a true Christian as a
[3:22] Christian your
[3:24] actions it will affect you it's going to
[3:28] affect your children and it can even
[3:30] affect the movement of the spirit in the
[3:33] church because the sin of a affected the
[3:36] whole Camp so we walking on a treadmill
[3:40] especially when it's getting very close
[3:43] it's getting more closer each and every
[3:45] day so it's up to you as individual to
[3:50] examine and check your life all the time
[3:53] so if you get in tral and you realize
[3:56] that it's your own bringing then you got
[3:58] to repent M you got to make things right
[4:02] with the person and everything you s
[4:05] against somebody you got to go to the
[4:06] person make it right it's something with
[4:09] God you make it right with God then the
[4:11] thing is
[4:12] settled and the second trials that comes
[4:17] to our life sometimes the enemy the
[4:19] devil trying to push us around so you
[4:22] got to watch just like job when he was
[4:26] in a trial he searched his life
[4:30] he said and even made a sacrifice for
[4:34] his children to make sure that it's not
[4:36] something that his children has brought
[4:38] onto him but when he realized that it
[4:41] wasn't any one of them what I'm saying
[4:44] is that when you get in trouble you get
[4:46] into trouble you get into tribulation
[4:49] you get into any trials and you know
[4:51] that is not your own doing but you
[4:54] realize that a devil trying to make you
[4:57] miserable uncomfortable this world then
[5:00] you got the power in Jesus name to cast
[5:03] him out right because the scripture said
[5:05] that you shall cast out devils in my
[5:08] name which is unbel so you have the
[5:10] power in Jesus name to cast that out
[5:13] from your family to cast it out from you
[5:16] and be free to serve your living God
[5:18] because the spirit of Christ is in you
[5:21] so you got authority over everything
[5:24] that the devil tries to bring to you so
[5:26] you cast that out in Jesus name
[5:30] and the third one
[5:32] which uh I'm going to base all my
[5:35] thoughts on my everything on is the
[5:39] trials that Believers have not because
[5:43] he has done anything wrong just like
[5:46] J it was God proving that I have
[5:51] confidence in my servant Jo amen so when
[5:54] your walk is right with the Lord Jesus
[5:57] Christ and you do everything right
[6:00] then sometimes God could say this my son
[6:05] is's adopted he can face every situation
[6:08] Hallelujah so he allow or permit the
[6:11] enemy to bring trials and tribulations
[6:14] in your life but he knew that he has
[6:17] confidence in you praise God that
[6:20] confidence has because he know that that
[6:23] word of Christ in you so without God
[6:26] revelation of God's word in you he know
[6:28] you stand by that and overcome every
[6:31] trials so with that confidence he permit
[6:35] things to come your way and in our
[6:38] scripture Abraham was our
[6:42] example and without going into
[6:48] details Abraham is not only the natural
[6:51] Seed of Abraham as Seed of Abraham you
[6:54] are a royal SE of Abraham because you
[6:57] have the same faith that Abraham had so
[7:02] in talking about it I won't have time to
[7:05] go back and forth but far I'm talking
[7:08] about Abraham you apply yourself in the
[7:11] in his shoes because you are you have
[7:14] the same faith that Abraham has amen
[7:18] okay so
[7:20] Abraham before not Abraham went into the
[7:26] trials with Isaac here that you read he
[7:30] after he has received the Holy Ghost
[7:33] which is a type of circumcision after
[7:36] the circumcision then you have this Tri
[7:39] so that's the Bible said that gri not
[7:42] the Holy Ghost until you are un until
[7:45] you which you are sealed until the day
[7:49] of your Redemption so when you become a
[7:54] Christian is
[7:58] not
[8:04] when you become a Christian it's not a
[8:06] FL bed of e I'm going to read this here
[8:11] he said and sometimes we have more
[8:13] troubles when you become a Christian
[8:16] than we did when we were
[8:18] Sinners because it is written many is
[8:22] the afflictions of the righteous but God
[8:26] deliver him from them Allen God promised
[8:30] many afflictions strange feelings and
[8:33] strange things that will be beyond our
[8:36] understanding it's always done for our
[8:39] good we just can't understand it because
[8:43] if we did then it will not be a Fai to
[8:46] us we will go with an understanding we
[8:50] will go with an understanding but we do
[8:53] it and we have it and you believe by
[8:57] faith his word that that is going to
[9:00] work some good thing for us amen
[9:04] so
[9:06] Abraham had his
[9:08] trials after the circumcision after he
[9:13] received the Holy Ghost it's not before
[9:17] he went through but after and even what
[9:21] God dealing with Abraham the same God
[9:25] dealing with you is not what you have
[9:27] done in the first place because God gave
[9:31] the condition to Adam that if you do
[9:34] this I do this but in Abraham his
[9:38] promise for him was unconditional
[9:40] promise so it's a
[9:43] Believer you your deing with God is not
[9:46] because of what you have done not how
[9:49] much good you are not how much you can
[9:51] leave
[9:52] [Music]
[9:52] [Applause]
[9:53] this Sanctified life or anything of that
[9:57] Stu but it's the netive life God L you
[10:02] more than you can even think of and
[10:04] because he loves you he allow you to go
[10:07] through all but whom I love I reuke and
[10:12] ITI so the love of God is beyond your
[10:15] measure so when you go through all those
[10:17] trials in said your Tri is like a more
[10:21] like a gold you need it to build your up
[10:24] as a Christian if you don't have those
[10:26] trials you not even know what kind of
[10:29] power what kind of faith that you have
[10:31] your life will be just like that thank
[10:33] you Lord if you are not being attacked
[10:35] by the enemy any angle of your life
[10:37] something is wrong because if you are
[10:39] doing damage into his kingdom he always
[10:41] going to come after you so what I'm
[10:43] trying to say is that if you go through
[10:45] any afflictions don't worry that God is
[10:48] on your part he love you that's why he
[10:51] permitted that to come to your part but
[10:53] he has given us a promise that he will
[10:56] never give you anything that you can can
[10:59] not be in anything that comes your way
[11:02] he will make a way for you there is a
[11:05] way of Escape there's a way that he give
[11:08] you an escape Hallelujah when Joshua
[11:11] made that City of Refuge when you ride
[11:14] to that City
[11:16] there's you get Deliverance no your
[11:20] accusers cannot do nothing to you but
[11:22] now you have the Lord Jesus Christ he is
[11:24] our City of Refuge right so anything
[11:27] that CS your way you go back to him he
[11:30] is there for you he's your City of
[11:32] Refuge the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[11:35] any way anything that comes your way our
[11:38] Lord is more than able to bring us out
[11:41] Hallelujah so don't get down that's
[11:44] right face every situation that is up to
[11:47] you sometimes you get to a place
[11:49] situation comes you can't know where to
[11:51] go everywhere seems dark God laughes
[11:55] that way he's looking at your reaction
[11:58] amen not hasn't forsake you nor forget
[12:02] about you but he wants to see how going
[12:04] to react Hallelujah he's said good God
[12:07] isn't it
[12:12] amen and back to that sanctify life as I
[12:17] was saying before
[12:20] that the L of God it goes beyond your
[12:24] moral life if it was only to be a moral
[12:28] good life
[12:29] then said that es was more gentl than
[12:33] Jacob but God chose Jacob because of
[12:39] what love Jacob I love is I hate is
[12:44] intive life and that elective life it
[12:48] brings you to a place is not our own
[12:51] Sanctified life it's not your making
[12:54] because if it was sany life most of us
[12:58] cannot you match the denominations I
[13:01] know why I'm saying that because last
[13:03] Thursday I met a sister he said
[13:06] Pentecostal I took my kids my children
[13:08] to their school
[13:10] um family night when we went there I
[13:15] went by myself and the children I end up
[13:18] into this Pentecostal sister she's dress
[13:24] 100% perfect nothing that you can talk
[13:28] about her
[13:29] and I said wow I like the way that you
[13:32] dress because in this time you don't
[13:34] have so many people who can even dress
[13:37] dist if you look at the par she was one
[13:40] out of the million over there and we
[13:43] began to talk and she was opening up and
[13:46] I said wow how that the Christian is
[13:51] going through pressure even our
[13:53] teenagers for them to even not to be
[13:55] wearing pants they have to go through a
[13:58] lot of pressure at school even even the
[14:01] sisters on the job side they go through
[14:04] pressure because of the way they dress
[14:07] because I was saying as a man when you
[14:09] become a
[14:10] Christian what do the people don't
[14:13] really you don't have much to overcome
[14:16] because of dressing but the CH the woman
[14:18] Tes the church so the man put on suit
[14:21] and everything just like a normal person
[14:24] but the sisters have to constantly go
[14:27] through all those persecution
[14:29] to prove to the world that there's
[14:32] somebody in
[14:34] 2017 here that obey God's way and said
[14:38] judgment to the rest of the world and
[14:41] once we were talking that she said yeah
[14:43] I believe everything that you were
[14:44] saying I baptized at the age of 15 and I
[14:49] drifted a little bit I came back at the
[14:52] age of 18 in Canada and I've been
[14:54] serving God ever since I have a son 16
[14:57] years and a half 12 and have eight so
[15:01] she's supposed to may be her 40s and
[15:03] she's been serving God for all the time
[15:05] but you see the problem of faith is I
[15:08] tried to go a little bit further to see
[15:10] her reaction and I said it's good our
[15:14] conversation went on very nice said I
[15:17] said have you do you know anything about
[15:20] fulfillment of Malachi
[15:22] 45 said she doesn't know so I right away
[15:26] she has the Bible in the
[15:29] she read Malachi 45 we talk about
[15:32] revelation 10:7 we talk about like the
[15:34] promise for our time because as Pastor
[15:38] said on Sunday you can have all that but
[15:41] if you don't believe this you don't have
[15:44] the oil this is the O for the
[15:47] AG of the you can have all the moral
[15:50] life and all the speaking son and
[15:53] everything all her children have been
[15:55] baptized in the name of Jesus they have
[15:57] done everything right mean
[15:59] but they don't have the oil the oil is
[16:01] what's important give o my keep it bur
[16:05] the oil you receive your word for the
[16:08] day that's the proof that you have which
[16:11] is the Holy Ghost outside that you don't
[16:14] have
[16:15] it so we talk we talk and she never
[16:18] resist anything she read the scriptures
[16:20] and she was so excited and I gave her
[16:24] our website address because like time
[16:26] was going and things were kind of
[16:29] disturbing our conversation so I just
[16:31] gave her a Church website address and
[16:34] voice of God and we kind of end up our
[16:37] conversation but what I'm trying to say
[16:39] tonight is that you are blessed amen you
[16:42] are elected son of daughter of God don't
[16:46] look that on yourself with all the me if
[16:49] the lordus was to be here tonight you
[16:52] were the elected seat if you were to be
[16:54] living back in his time you would have
[16:57] been a class of people and the rest
[16:59] because they recognize the word of God
[17:02] for their day and for you to recognize
[17:05] what God is doing present stage of his
[17:09] ministry don't take it for granted don't
[17:12] take it for granted don't don't let take
[17:15] it
[17:16] lightly it's the most important thing in
[17:19] life to recognize what God is doing
[17:23] that's right present stage amen you are
[17:27] privileged am
[17:29] it's not because of what you have done
[17:31] but because of his elective love amen
[17:35] and love is what is doing it you can't
[17:39] buy this it's not by yourth of
[17:42] righteousness it's not your moral life
[17:46] then M they pray like 7 times a day but
[17:49] what has to them killing people and all
[17:52] that kind understand is the grace of God
[17:55] Amen it's the Sovereign Grace that has
[17:58] brought is all that far and I I just I
[18:02] can go on and on and on because we are
[18:05] privileged people we are people that God
[18:08] has
[18:09] elected one a million for this end time
[18:14] because even on the Victoria Hol day on
[18:18] Monday I went again with my children for
[18:22] a playing Ground nor come to third line
[18:25] here they have a nice playr over there
[18:27] but for some reason I said we're not
[18:30] coming there we just I reach Wiston
[18:33] Churchill let's go and relax over here
[18:36] of my daughters said no that we not
[18:38] coming here we have to go I like up I
[18:40] said no we stand here and then once they
[18:44] were playing over there I just bumped
[18:46] into a man he said his name is j he's
[18:50] been in Canada here not for too long in
[18:53] torto not for too long and he
[18:57] said he love the Lord Jesus Christ but
[19:01] since he came here he's been attending
[19:05] couple of churches so many churches but
[19:07] when he go to those churches there's
[19:11] nothing there for him he said the people
[19:14] they
[19:15] Pastor songs he goes for Fellowship
[19:19] there's no God in their
[19:21] conversation so he's kind
[19:24] of dying then I said the Bible said that
[19:28] there is going to be a farming in the
[19:31] land not for food natural food or drink
[19:35] but for the true word of God and I told
[19:38] him if there was ever a time there is
[19:41] that fing in the land it is now is a
[19:44] present tense there is a fing in the
[19:47] land what we are feeding on is unfailing
[19:50] reality of the Living God but the people
[19:53] out there the domination they don't have
[19:55] even one millions of what you got so you
[19:58] got than God you got to your L you got
[20:01] to be ready you got to ask for the
[20:03] Revival in your heart every day because
[20:06] we living the closing chapters of his
[20:08] coming what God has given to you what
[20:11] have you
[20:12] done are youing with it so
[20:17] precious with it yes it's so precious
[20:20] than anything that go Sil than anything
[20:23] else this is truth we have to give our
[20:27] all you all to it
[20:29] I wonder sometimes we sleeping too long
[20:31] too much I wonder sometimes we the
[20:35] emphas on things that have no value the
[20:39] things that have value Happ those things
[20:42] that money cannot buy only God gives
[20:45] that you can't buy piece of from the
[20:48] supermarket those are the things that
[20:50] are precious to but sometimes to things
[20:55] that have no value those things God will
[20:57] give you to you seeking theom of
[21:02] and all
[21:04] things you
[21:07] whatever to give it to you you put him

[22:17] hallelujah
[22:19] hallelujah
[22:21] amen and back what I'm
[22:23] saying that
[22:26] Abraham he went through trials is that
[22:30] right and a a true Christian a royal of
[22:34] Abraham you going to have your
[22:36] persecution going to have your own
[22:38] trials and I believe that the
[22:43] pressure that is coming in this time is
[22:47] great is coming every day we living a
[22:51] pressure age pressure for the family
[22:54] pressure for the individual pressure for
[22:56] the government and do you ever ask
[22:59] yourself why are they making all those
[23:04] laws they have one person in mind it's
[23:07] you all the laws have been formed
[23:10] against you as a bride of Christ as
[23:12] Pastor said that one time their enemies
[23:16] me so all those things are against us M
[23:20] and I believe with all my heart that
[23:25] there is this for the Bible said as was
[23:28] in the days of Sodom Andorra so shall it
[23:31] be when the stand of mind is revealed if
[23:34] there was ever a time that the coition
[23:37] in this world in it is now is a
[23:41] fulfillment of that scripture Hallelujah
[23:44] and God is Reve once again the bright
[23:47] form there that fulfillment and the
[23:49] whole world is in condition hallelujah
[23:53] hallelujah I believe the scripture in
[23:56] Luke 23
[23:58] 3 29 let me see Luke
[24:05] 23:29 I WR
[24:15] see I think yeah Luke
[24:18] [Music]
[24:20] 23 yeah yeah 29 he said for
[24:25] behold the day are
[24:29] coming in the which they shall see
[24:33] blessed are the B and the wombs that
[24:36] never
[24:38] bear and the nap which never g s do you
[24:43] think there is ever a time that scpt is
[24:46] fulfilled I believe it's
[24:48] now why saying that I'm going to read
[24:51] this to you apart from right right now

[25:38] children Sweden stepan Lin no children
[25:43] lber no children SC ni St have also have
[25:49] no children J clo president the European
[25:53] commission has no children and if I
[25:57] believe
[25:58] if somebody is a president or a prime
[26:01] minister he an example that the people
[26:06] look up to and if all these major
[26:10] leaders if they have no children you
[26:13] think if there's going to be a
[26:15] generation to come would the children
[26:17] would they have children because they're
[26:19] looking up to
[26:21] them they said in Germany one out of
[26:25] three College
[26:28] graduates have no children in Canada one
[26:32] out of five have no children in 2011
[26:36] when they did the
[26:38] census then they recognized that there
[26:40] are more people living as singles more
[26:45] than
[26:45] couples what time are we living in I
[26:49] believe it's a condition because they
[26:52] make the laws and the conditions the
[26:54] land it becomes difficult to raise
[26:57] children
[26:59] why do you think have only two children
[27:01] was the same condition right there over
[27:04] here now it becomes
[27:08] childless Society theys have no children
[27:12] how are they going to make laws to help
[27:14] you raise your children you tell
[27:17] me this is the time we are living in and
[27:21] all the
[27:22] L that they are making is to put
[27:26] pressure on you and
[27:29] me and God loves
[27:32] that he is the god who never changes
[27:36] amen we going to go through the pressure
[27:38] we going to go through the that's I said
[27:41] that I believe the same way the Rapture
[27:45] is a process leading to an
[27:47] event some of the events like the
[27:51] squeeze in it is all a process God allow
[27:55] you to go through this brings you out

[28:41] Moses Moses the people stand still and
[28:45] see the salvation of the Lord and the
[28:48] Lord told Moses why crying speak and go

[34:43] God when he de all those things what
[34:47] happened he gave up his spirit and that
[34:50] same God the Holy Ghost came on Peter he
[34:54] came on the apostles and excuse me those
[34:57] Pentecostal that try to make speaking in
[35:00] as the evidence of the Holy
[35:02] Ghost when the pet in the res the people
[35:05] understand them is that right so speak
[35:10] inong understand something is
[35:13] wrong so what I'm trying to say is
[35:16] that Peter John the rest all those
[35:21] Apostles what do you think they did when
[35:24] they found that they recognized
[35:27] that this is the truth they give their

[36:20] dwells inside of you it will
