[Music] to me [Music] to leave for I know for I know he has come he has come on [Music] yes [Music] praise God Amen glory to God [Music] this morning we're blessed have with us decided that she will identify with the body of Jesus Christ today I say we are privileged we are honored to be able to witness this wonderful testimony of our sister amoya and so you know just in talking a little bit about baptism we know that it's not baptism that saves us you know that right baptism is not like you know you go into the water and you take a bath and you leave the dirt behind though there is a spiritual application to that when it happens in a genuine way baptism is being buried in the water and knowing that your old life has been washed away amen praise God we read it in First Peter chapter 3 verse 21 where the scripture says and corresponding to that baptism now saves you not the removal of dirt from the flesh but as an appeal to God for a good conscious through the resurrection of Jesus Christ so in other words something has taken place within a moya's consciousness she has become aware of the reality of God she's become aware of her reality in God and that she has a place in the body of Jesus Christ it's now identifying herself in the same way that a woman takes her husband at marriage she is doing that in a spiritual form she's making the Lord Jesus Christ her savior her Lord her absolute amen [Music] so understanding that baptism is also a death because it says in Romans chapter 6 know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life so you're actually beginning a new life you're young you're only born how many years ago 13 years ago most of us don't experience the new birth till much later in life but you're getting to experience it at a very young age which shows that something special something genuine has taken place within you it's not because Mom and Dad go to church it's not because the Bible says you should be baptized because you went to a youth camp and maybe you heard that you need to be baptized we don't believe in that kind of baptism in this church we believe in genuine experience where the Holy Spirit reveals to you in your heart that it's time to identify who you really are in this world so in Acts 2 38 it says repent and without repentance there is no true baptism that's why it says repent and be baptized so we we look at our lives we we see the the old life and we're willing we desire for that old life to be just left behind and that's why the type of the burial it gets left behind [Music] and so you don't want to go down a dry Center and come up a wet center right [Music] amen praise God so like it says in Acts 22 16 in other words of ananias to the newly saved Paul and now why do you wait that's why you went to your parents something stirred within you why do you wait rise and be baptized wash away your sins calling on the name of the Lord let us enter into the water [Music] so amoya today you've come here on your own accord [Music] be identified with the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise God do you from this day decide that you will serve him with all of your heart [Music] the good I do amen praise God upon the confession of your faith I'm going to baptize you today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ first let us all pray our gracious Eternal Father Lord what a wonderful day this is I know all of Heaven is rejoicing because of one turning to you accepting you as their absolute this morning identifying themselves that they are a daughter of the king and Lord the enemy is not going to like it we know he's going to fight but we also as a household of faith join together as Sons and Daughters of God and we bind that power and that influence in and around amoya's life from this day we arrest your activity and we command you to lose her life her atmospheres every cell and every molecule of her being we bind your powers and your activities in the name of Jesus Christ amoya according to your confession I now baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Applause] [Music] God bless you Saints [Applause] to lead God's ego I'm I know he will guide me [Music] for I know foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you glory to God God bless you Saints wonderful wonderful see a new baby being born Hallelujah this is what it's all about amen new ones coming into the kingdom amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord today we're going to get right right into the word this morning I hope you're all feeling fine prayed up expecting to hear from him the spirit of the Living God this morning amen I know I am Hallelujah let us turn to the Book of Revelations chapter three we've got two scriptural reading this morning and then we're going to go to Mark 4 11. we're still talking on the mystery I hope the mystery is becoming not a mystery anymore to you is being unfold and revealed to you I want to take uh the title this morning the mystery of the third poll is now in the bride there's many different angles that people preach on the third pole but I pray today that this angle that I'm going to be taking here would just be as simple as possible and that you would understand amen that's what it's all about is understanding we don't want to preach it over your head that you don't understand but something a substance that you can take in your life and recognize amen we need to recognize what God is doing in our lives in order to place it back into the word to bring Faith to us that's what it's all about amen hallelujah so let us turn to Revelations 10 3. and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not so they're not written not written Hallelujah may they be Unwritten to you this today brother Tim can't do it I'm just gonna do some preaching the way I can preach but it's him that's got to do it Mark 4 11. and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God it's given to you so the Mysteries the seven Thunders weren't written but they're given to you but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables that seeing they may see and not perceive and herein they may hear but not understand less at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them father we thank you for your love grace and mercy this morning we lift you up on high father we lift no man for you said if we lift you up this morning you'll draw all men unto thee that's what we need this morning Lord we need you father the spirit of the Living God to have the preeminence here Lord speak to your children you know who they are father you know their hearts you know their lives May by your spirit father speak to them and Lord by The Authority that's invested in me I take every Spirit every contrary Spirit under subjection to the Holy Ghost the word of God this morning Lord that you might have the preeminence and that the children of the Living God might have the Liberty that is purchased for them this morning and that we may all Rejoice together and again I say rejoice in Jesus Christ's name I pray you may be seated God bless you Hallelujah amen so we see here it's not written and we can see Thunders not Thunder Thunders and we can see voices not voice but voice is so when John was caught up he heard Thunders and we know the Thunders is the voice of God so John heard God speaking many things to him and revealing many things to him but he said John seal those things up because I don't want man to touch this this is left to me and me alone to the individual and I will come to them at their appointed time and I will reveal to them and that's what this is all about it's not about religion it's not about you know ourselves and what we can preach what we can understand and what you can understand is about him revealing to us who we are I can't tell you who you are it's not my position God has not given it to me just like he hasn't given Jesus many things when he was on the earth to know and it's not given us to know but he knows Hallelujah amen brother Branham speaking here but all this mystery is revealed only as he has promised to his bride hell is against this truth of this revelation of this mystery but the bride stands on it that's her stand what is she standing on the word the revelation of the word that's what she sees for is the revealing of the word in her life Hallelujah that's why you hunger that's why you thirst that's why you seek there's something inside of you that deep calling to the Deep it's not you it's the attribute what God placed of himself inside of you and this whole mystery is about getting yourself out of the way and letting him who deposit himself inside of you take control he knows what to do with the word when it says the bride will know what to do with the word is because he knows what to do with the word I have spoken I will perform saith the Lord that's what this faith is coming to my brothers and sisters is becoming perfect within us a perfect revelation of how to get out of the way and surrender Our Lives simple amen Jesus said you must be born again you must be born it must be done it's a must Jesus said or you can't see or enter into the kingdom of this mystery that's inside of you we've seen the first steps repentance amen being baptized now Faith is if faith has been placed in her heart then the promise is she shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and when the spirit of truth comes it will guide you and lead you into all truth Who You Are your position your calling your purpose of why this happened another mystery being unfolded another mystery being revealed that was in God's mind Hallelujah amen Hallelujah Jesus said amen to Peter it is given to you to know and it's the father who reveals it to you and he said once that is revealed to you the gates of hell will not Prevail against it oh the gates of hell is against it my brothers and sisters oh against what against you recognizing who you are recognizing that you're part of this mystery Hallelujah God over and over that's what preaching is about over and over until finally the light turns on you hear it over and over and God is not he doesn't do anything for nothing he knows why He's speaking your carnal mind might say oh I heard this many many times before but in the spirit realm God said I'm working and I'm doing something to break unbelief off your heart and off your life so you can really see it for who it is and who you are amen now the meaning of Mystery something that is difficult or impossible to understand or explain now keep that in mind as we go along here because that is a big part of the third pull we know that the third poll is the revealing of the word we don't know much about the third Paul if you go study in the message about the third poll there is not a lot said because just as John said write it not even God himself to the prophet said no no the first Paul you explained you made a mess of it the second Paul you did the same thing and I told you not to but this third Paul I'm not leaving it nobody's not even the prophet's hands but I myself have come down I myself will reveal it and I myself will take control of it now and that's what he's doing now he's the one walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks he's the one walking up and down the pews not man but God revealing these things glory to God look at this mystery my brothers and sisters look at this third Paul this third poll has been activated and moving since the Garden of Eden but we didn't understand down Through the Ages they didn't understand until this day when God sent a prophet and revealed all these Mysteries that were unfolded now we can look back amen and see that the third Paul was manifesting all down through history let's take a look at Abraham we never connected like Abraham and that to the third pole third pull was operating Abraham father of our faith the faith sheet of Abraham the Royal Seed of Abraham came Hallelujah all connected together God promised to Abraham to have a son when it was impossible for Sarah to conceive there's that word I told you keep it in your mind impossible difficult to understand or explain okay when it was impossible for Sarah to conceive God revealed to Abraham by faith but then God had to change Sarah and Abraham back to young man and woman to fulfill the promise and what did God have to do it says right here God visited Sarah whoa my that's the visitation when God visited Sarah then the promise The Impossible came into view when God visits you when God spoke to you when God called you that was the third Paul the revealing of him and the revealing of you in your life that's all we need that's all we need today that's all we need going forward in the future is God to visit us and reveal these things to us amen and when he visited her he revealed to her you're going to conceive This Promise it's going to be fulfilled and that whole experience was God manifesting the third pull to Sarah Oh Glory to God when God visited us the only thing he says amen because God is the word Amen in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God it's all about the word and when God visited us he comes and speaks the word to us the promises to us and like Sarah he says you're going to conceive the promise that I give you in this day and this hour of a body change a Rapture you're going to conceive oh my glory to God we look back in the Bible at Enoch you talk about the third poll manifesting Enoch walk Walking with God and by Walking with God the word Enoch was translated and raptured as we walk with god with this perfect Faith feeding on it that is the mystery and the miracle that is unexplainable of the third Paul it's the creation of God himself creating in us the change that we need to live eternally the change that we need to be raptured Walking with God walk in with the word amen every day Enoch walk with God he walked in faith oh my Hallelujah glory to God thank you Jesus amen Hallelujah I knew this wasn't going to be easy but that's okay the real word when it comes forth is never easy Hallelujah because it's not me don't think I'm talking about myself or I'm special special gift or anything like that but it's him it's him that's what I'm saying it's not man we don't want to lift man up it's him he's here trying to reveal the secrets to you he's here trying to reveal something to you in your life Hallelujah the invisible become invisible right here right now your natural eyes see what you're seeing around here you can see me up here but there's visible eyes amen invisible eyes oh God like Elijah told Elijah open up his eyes Lord and show them that there's more here with us than them that's what it's all about he's here oh my we break into that kind of faith we break into that kind of atmosphere with him amen that's where signs wonders Miracles Supernatural things will take place Revelations Hallelujah oh my you see Enoch walking in perfect harmony with the spirit of Revelation upon him that was bringing Perfection as he walked with God Enoch Knew Too Much he couldn't stay here anymore Hallelujah God was walking so close with him and revealing so much to him God says you've got to go you can't stay here oh my I imagine Enoch just feasting on the word and the Revelation and it's just revealing and revealing you talk about the third pull you talk about perfect Faith back in that day happening to a man hallelujah it's all through the scriptures amen oh my glory to God let us walk with God let us walk with the word let's walk and put everything aside amen who can touch your heart like he does if he has touched your heart you'll know nobody can touch your heart nobody can do the things he can do in your life in your conscience when you're when you get all trapped up inside you get fear inside of you you get scared you get worried all these things nobody touches those areas like he does nobody brings faith and comfort in your life like he does nobody brings that faith that you need to overcome like he does oh my just about recognizing he's been here all along in your life he's been there all along in your life oh my God thank you Lord brother Brown is speaking here just walk unconscious of fear walk unconscious of criticism walk unconscious unto the world walk as you walk in Christ walk with him not paying attention to the right hand or to the left hand just keep moving on if something comes up in the church walk with God hallelujah he says walk with God what is it is it this carnoram amen this fleshly REM en that's why we don't walk in the flesh we don't connect in the flesh Hallelujah I don't even want to connect with my flesh why would I want you to connect with my flesh well Richard man that I am what brother Tim that's not positive speaking well Paul said oh my there's somebody inside of me that's perfect hallelujah amen Hallelujah if sickness strikes you walk with God don't interfere your walk in anything for any excuse just keep walking with God walking with this revelation God is doing something if the neighbor don't like you walk with God just keep walking with God Enoch walked one day like that you know what he done he walked all the way home with God we want to walk all the way home with God Hallelujah keep walking with God Amen thank you Lord he got so far up the road he didn't know what he didn't want to come back anymore oh yes I'm telling you my brothers and sisters I know we're experiencing it here I I can see it in Fellowship amen we're getting so far up the road here hallelujah we don't want to stay here anymore because why it's not just a mental thing a carnal thing we don't want to stay here like you know I remember when I first came into the message amen we we just this thing was striking oh my God the you talk about the third pull I didn't understand what's taking place back there things that God was revealing I wanted to go home in a Rapture Hallelujah but I didn't understand what going home in the Rapture was I didn't understand that there was nothing here for me because I went through many years of of of walking this walk ups and downs and recognizing that God had to deal with me God had to bring me through so many experiences to recognize I don't belong here now I can say this world is not my home I'm just passing through I know my treasures are laid up Hallelujah amen where my heart is there are my treasures oh God may God Find Us Faithful like that may God who knows our hearts this morning in our lives testify of that and be pleasing in his sight your walk with him oh my thank you Lord amen yes Lord in the same way God is visiting the bride secretly revealing the promises of her day that is the third Paul that will be completed in her in the same way God changed Abraham and Sarah's body God will change his bride back to being young again the third pull is revealing the word and the word is the one that is doing it in this hour not anything else but the word now I'm emphasizing on certain things because I'm going to get to certain things down the road Hallelujah is very important the third pull will be no impersonation it will be just a manifestation hallelujah thank God for that you know because every time God gives us something and we try to understand it we tried to figure it out then we tried to manifest it oh look at the law look at the legalism in this message How can there be legalism when we oh this is the message of Grace Grace call and Grace but there's legalism there's law in this message why because people try to figure it out people misplace it that's why Hallelujah amen but there will only be a manifestation look at the tent vision the people came out of the other side's change now listen they went into the tent and they came out on the other side change they could not explain what happened because there was no impersonation or explanation to this it was just a manifestation that nobody can explain when God visited you at the appointed time there will be no explanation to what has happened it will just be the promise manifested in your life oh my amen no explanation you can't explain this all you can do is believe it accept it when it comes and reveals in your heart and keep walking from one side of the tent to the other side of the tent the word and it will manifest itself it will produce itself oh my God oh I love God that way hey don't you who have experienced them that way I don't know how it happened I I know I had this I know I was hearing these voices I know I had this sickness I know I had this problem this struggle inside of my heart all of a sudden I just kept walking and believing and praying to God Amen and all of a sudden it was gone no explanation just a manifestation a change took place it was gone and I was changed I look back that's why brother Branham and his wife were walking and he's walking over the wood there amen and as he's testifying he looked down he's dripping God he said oh God I'm walking with you I forgot I was walking with you he's walking all the time with God all throughout his ministry all through the ups and downs of sicknesses he was walking with God and then he looked back at his wife as he was young he was young whoa why oh I'm walking with God oh my just to get that driven out of you and you got something to do with this get it out of you your own works your own understanding lean not to your understanding but in all your ways acknowledge me the word what I said what I promise I will perform it I will manifest it I will do it only believe that's why the angel loved us so much God is making this as easy as possible for you I hope I pray God help me to make it as easy as possible to you with your ears amen glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah Hebrews 11. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen I never seen that scripture like that before faith is a things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen is not seen amen it's not conceived by us it's not done by us is unseen this manifestation this Deliverance it's unexplainable uncomprehendable but that's what faith is when it comes to you Oh Glory to God Hallelujah yes through faith Sarah received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised that's all we need to do judge him faithful is he faithful oh my then you're a people looking for this body change and your people this morning looking for a change because that is the body change little by little I will deliver my people here a little there a little I will come and I will visit you at the appointed time of your season and of your walk and of your deliverance and amen I will reveal these things to you and I will change you what do you think these chains have been taking place brother Brandon says you live above sin don't you you don't do this anymore you don't think this anymore more amen you walk different now you act different you talk different what was that you that was him that was the visitations over and over visiting us and revealing to us oh my Hallelujah glory to God amen Mark 11 22. Jesus answered and said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you whatsoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said now that scripture became a new scripture to me it didn't become a human effort work in up scripture oh I got to speak unto this mountain I gotta say unto this mountain but it all became different to me when he says when you say unto this mountain is actually him it's actually him saying unto this mountain amen it's actually him when the spoken word was manifested in the prophet it was him manifesting the spoken word God was just using his lips to speak what he wanted to be spoken Hallelujah God gives you faith God reveals Faith to you and that's what you speak it's him doing it not you because we speak to so many things we speak to so many things and then our faith gets discouraged when that mountain stays right there the right approach to God Amen and see a nut Ezekiel 36 26 a new heart will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh amen it's him he's doing it Hallelujah the king's sword was placed in the prophet's hand and we know the sword is the word of God it was not even written in symbols but when the king's sword was placed in the prophet's hand then the Seven Seals were opened and the third Paul was now starting to reveal to the bride what was not written and and I believed it was the Awakening of the Bride to understand who she is and her position God reveals her whole life everything that's happened to her and the purpose why things are happening to her and why it happened to her you weren't saved on a certain day amen you are always in the mind of God don't want to bring you back to a day that you were saved or day that you recognized but he wants to bring you back with him that you are with him in his mind glory to God Glory Hallelujah revealing to her her purpose revealing to her her life why things had to happen the way they happen in your life why you had to go through the things that you had to go through Hallelujah that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord not only when you were here but when you were out there God was ordering your life all along the way why because it was him there was him in you he deposited himself in you and he swore by himself amen I have spoken my word not only through a prophet in these last days but before the foundation of the world when he spoke everything into existence I spoke my word and it won't return void back to me and we can see all down Through the Ages Satan trying to to take that seed try to kill that seed but God spoke amen his word he spoke us and that's why we're here today oh my unshakable faith unshakable confidence unshakable God faithful God true and faithful God all down Through the Ages who are me who are you in your little life in your little portion amen that God can't take care of you God can't watch over you God can't deliver you and what he's done all down Through the Ages that bring us to this time and this moment in life Hallelujah glory to God amen that King's sword hey was placed in the prophet's hands announced in the bride's hands glory to God amen Hallelujah God has always in every age has hid himself behind the veil but he's been God all the time you see I say that for a reason I said that before see but he kept himself hid from the world and revealed himself to the elected all the fullness of the godhead bodily was in this person Jesus Christ he was God and God Alone not a third person not a second person or even a first person no but he was the person of God failed in human flesh Hallelujah no confusion here when God speaks when God does something he's not the author of confusion Satan is he's the person of God himself and what is he saying here he said he came himself he's the person of God in you himself not anything else but the true and one living God that was veiled and hid down Through the Ages has veiled has wrecked the veil in this day and age and now that true God is manifesting himself that's who's inside of you oh Hallelujah First Timothy 3 16 without controversy what is controversy dispute or argument or debate nothing great is the mystery of godliness for God g-o-d Elohim capital in the Bible it refers to him as original in the beginning Elohim see and Elohim without controversy Hallelujah without debate argument great is the mystery of Elohim for Elohim was made flesh and we handled him Glory Elohim veiled in human flesh the great Jehovah that covered all space and time and every Wares was made man we handle him Elohim the unveiling of God God made flesh what a what what am I trying to try to say here the Holy Spirit God this is nothing but God this in your life is nothing but God Elohim not not not anything else not no Superstition not no fantasy not no gifts this is God Elohim himself when we can recognize that God owl him is inside of us the Bible says you'll do when they recognize their God that they serve as the god that's in them they'll do great exports Hallelujah they'll take this word in their lives right to the Rapture right to their Deliverance an old devil in hell can stand against you this morning if you take that word of God and speak it the gates of hell can't Prevail against this Elohim is in you made flesh again that's what he's trying to say that's what the prophets try to say not just tell you about Elohim back there but Elohim up here Elohim here what is he doing Where's God today where is he living today oh Jesus the reality of God brother coffee amen the reality of God oh thank you Jesus amen Amen brother Brown speaking here but since Pentecost since the crucifixion when that veil was rent from top to bottom for that generation Jesus was that God veiled and when he died on Calvary God sent the fire and lightning to rip that Veil from top to bottom that whole Mercy Seat was in plain view but they were too blind to see it as Paul said in the reading of Moses when Moses is read yet the veil is still on their hearts today Moses types of prophet the letter of the word not the unwritten word but the letter of the word see the ones who have given eyes to see and ears to hear can recognize what the spirit is saying to the church that this is happening again today when the prophet's message is read and the quotes are read the veil is still on their hearts not recognizing that he's in plain view again today and we Behold Him we beheld him we handled him oh God oh Lord Jesus brother Branham oh brothers and sisters that's what the Jews did when the veil was rent and brought God into Plain View hanging on the cross he was in plain view they couldn't see it could it be possible that the Gentiles has done the same thing oh God he says and God took the veil off of it and brought into Plain View in this day and they are ready to crucify it again oh help me um Hallelujah Lord Jesus remember Satan will try to impersonate it he'll try to impersonate everything that the church will do we notice it through the Antichrist but this is one thing he can't impersonate it'll be no mimics to this thing because he don't know it there's no way for him to know it it's the third pull he just don't know nothing about it see he doesn't understand it he don't understand you he don't know nothing about you but we constantly let him interpret to us who we are when he doesn't know you even your natural family don't even know you unless God rips the veil off of their eyes they won't see who's really behind there living behind there oh God it's you and God Alone how many times I gotta read this and I'll read this because the spirit leads me to read it he knows nothing about this you don't understand it he can't impersonate this so kick him out kick him out of your thoughts out of your mind all doubts doubt your doubts of Who You Are of who this word and this preaching and the Bible says you are glory to God letting people that know nothing about this I gotta bring it right home interpret to you who you are carnal people people from your workplaces you're maybe your husband that's not saved your wife that's not saved family members and try to interpret to you who this is oh my brothers and sisters separation always when the word of God comes it produces a separation and it always exposes the devil Hallelujah glory to God yeah but Satan is working hard to distract us deceive us and hinder us from seeing this truth that's why he fights it so much so we must not let Satan interpret the word to us personally in our walks in our life because he knows nothing about this just like he spoke to Eve he you know that you know when he spoke to Eve in the Garden of Eden we all know the story you know he he didn't know nothing about that tree of life he didn't know nothing what God revealed to Eve until Eve spoken and then when Eve spoke it and said oh the serpent came said eat of this tree oh no no no we we shall not the Lord God said not eat of that tree you see she revealed what God spoke through her husband the head Christ is our head not to eat of that tree but when she did it what does Satan do he twisted it he perverted it I said oh you shall surely not die hasn't God said doesn't God said you're elected president God said you're predestinated hasn't God said that you know his grace will cover you can do whatever you want oh oh my God says stay behind the word the word is what we stay behind Satan cannot fight you he can't do nothing to you if you stay behind that word or he'll fight up that's not what I'm talking about in your flesh and circumstances and situations around your life but all is well with my soul there's peace inside that passes all understanding Oh Glory to God he can't touch this yeah they got a song on the world can't touch this but I'm telling you you can't touch this Satan You Can't Touch This Hallelujah a glory to God stop worrying trust in the Lord Jesus said don't worry about tomorrow it'll worry about itself the pagans worry about such things stop being led by your feelings your emotions especially you sisters amen truth don't care about your emotions and your feelings they're great indicators there are great motivators but they are bad leaders Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God not by any of these things I thought you're preaching on the third poll I am I am this is the third poll bring this into manifestation in your life and you'll see Hallelujah the written word man tries to do things but God don't need us to do anything all we need to do is surrender and yield ourselves to the Holy Spirit John 16. 13 when the spirit of truth comes it will guide you into all truth don't worry the spirit of God is here the Holy Ghost is here in your life walk every day walk by faith the faith that God give you when you step out of these doors when you wake up tomorrow morning walk by that faith that he gives you and as the day progresses amen he the spirit of Truth we will reveal all things to you he'll show you things to come oh my no worry but trust in the Lord that's a powerful word my brothers and sisters 32 years I've heard it and it keeps getting richer and deeper and deeper as we go trust in the Lord oh my God hallelujah brother Brown's speaking here and so when man lives by faith and walks by faith I mean substance faith not imagination not put on substance that's what this is a substance he's isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in Christ there now you're getting into bride interior you want to know bride material is we're talking about it the word is talking about it it's been talking about it and he goes see see three times perfection you're getting into Rapture and condition now that means each and every one of us not just the pastor the deacons the trustees it means the laity every individual walks in a world with God Alone there you're baptized with him he gives you the orders you pack them out whatever he says there's not a shadow of a doubt nowhere you walk right on now you're coming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection you say brother Tim how do I get there how do I know when I'm getting there how do I know when this thing is starting to uh you know mature and manifest in my life here it is here it is right here now you're becoming into perfect Faith perfect Perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a message to them with his perfect faith and so it is it now those who have perfect Faith are Mystic to others he is not dead but in the form of the Holy Ghost he's in his people moving amongst his bride with a love affair to her pouring out himself to her there's nothing left for us to do but to believe it and believe amen it's the substance that and that creates perfect faith in us that is the substance is the creator himself walking with him he's the one that's creating the perfect Faith within our lives Hallelujah Hallelujah then Satan is defeated because he cannot fight against the truth this Revelation the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it perfect Faith reveals how God overcomes the enemy in our lives and drives him out so that he can have their peremians Hallelujah look at First Kings chapter 19 verse 5. Hallelujah the Lord talking to Elijah he told him rise and eat for the journey is great the bride has been given fresh Manna she has been given this revealed word of this day the third bull is here and operating and manifesting in our midst arise and eat the third Paul is the bride's fresh manna that will give her strength to make it through this journey and the pressure and the squeeze that is coming on even now this squeeze that is coming on that is the bride's purpose of fulfilling herself with oil remember that the ten virgins the wise and the foolish this Manna is filling her with oil every day glory to God hallelujah amen preparing her getting her ready a word bride prepared for the Dynamics to bring this third poll into full power manifestation in this hour it's here it's manifesting it's operating but it's got to come to the place of full manifestation and we know the events are taking place right now that are going to bring it on my brothers and sisters we got to be feeding on this word Walking with God every day walking with the spirit every day not look into the world because the world is showing the prophecies the Council of churches are here the mark of the beast is here the New World Order is here Hallelujah the Antichrist spirit is here now it's not for us to look at that Look Away to Jesus in your hearts look away to Jesus look to the word is there never been a time what am I trying to say there's never been a time of Consecration and dedication and separation to the word itself to the faith that you got with inside of you to the walk the god that's revealed himself to you is this day in this hour because I squeeze is squeezing is squeezing it's getting closer my brothers and sisters oh oh you live in Canada and there's only a little thing it's common it's common remember Russia was raised up for a purpose I heard this uh guy talking and he's talking to the feminist he says you feminist what are you going to do he's not religious this wasn't a religious thing you feminist what are you going to do or you other people what are you trans and all that and homosexuals and all that what are you going to do when Russia comes and I'm looking I'm going looking at the thing is it's not religious nothing it's just a guy speaking when Russia comes when China comes where's your feminist going to be when they walk on your land and it's prophesied Amen they're going to walk the the United States in a and Canada are going to be blown up to ashes and to Pieces amen they're going to be invaded just like they're being invaded now Supernatural invasions taking place now what are you going to do where where's all these movements going to be brother and sister don't worry about these movements all these movements that they're trying to stop and and try to change that's a that that's for them to do not for us that's not our vision and our goal our goal is to put on this perfect Faith this word our our goal is to be locked in with Jesus behind the inner veil with God Walking with God so that the world before it goes to the end can see another manifestation of Jesus Christ and flesh again oh my God that's what the third pull does in your life it brings you to that place Hallelujah glory to God amen thank you Lord my sheep hear my voice and the voice of God is his word signs of his coming those God just those God called is the ones who will hear it my sheep hear my voice that's right they know the voice of God it speaks from the word the word of God calls the bride the bride will only be chosen if they remain faithful to the word of God Jesus speaking in the Bible Revelation 17 14 and they that are with him are called The Chosen and the faithful is there never going to be a time where the test is going to come and being faithful to this word is now oh there's going to be a test and a try upon what we call the mess age of this of this hour the prophet let me tell you there's going to be something inside the Bride of Jesus Christ whatever whatever is allotted for her amen just like the down in the Dark Ages where they had to give their life the anointing was there everything that they had to go through God send the anointing there and the anointing is hair the anointing is being released today and every time you come into the presence of God upon your life to overcome Amen to withstand the pressure and all the attacks that are coming upon the Earth is here now Hallelujah that's why it's important Amen to assemble yourselves to yield yourselves to commit yourselves Oh Glory to God Hallelujah Luke 18 8 nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the Earth there will be little bible faith in the end people will just believe in man-made Fables Romans 10 17 so then Faith come by here and here and by the word of God deception is based on claiming now listen to me and hear me out before you get critical claiming that brother Brandon's quotes are the voice of God now listen to brother Branham the eagle stirs her nest 1960. I'm saying it for a reason I tell you it pays you to listen to the voice of God the still Small Voice that speaks deep and Rich it attracts the attention of his people we know the Bible is right that's not my voice the word it's not my voice he says that's God's voice speaking in the chosen of a bride but the word of God attracts the bride of Christ while the true bride attracts the attention of God by keeping his word that's how she attracts God by keeping his word you heard it many many times over here in the spirit back to the word back to this truth back to the original faith that will produce oh the spirit of God has to fight what man has done what man has interpreted what man's doctrines have come you're going to see rate you're going to see right in here amen that we we look at the Catholic Church the mother of heartless and all that stuff that Catholic spirit is right here in the message right here watch the early church searched the scriptures to check what Paul Saint Paul was saying acts 17 10 when the Brethren immediately sent Away Paul as Silas by night who come in hither went into the synagogue of the Jews there they were Noble then those in thessalonia in that they received the word with all Readiness of mine and searched the Scriptures Daily whether those things were so if we would search the Scriptures Daily and see that the things that have been spoken are so we let so many things distract us hinder us this life God help us you know the more we have the more material things we have the more responsibility we have amen sometimes it's more the curse that we have the less we have even as you get older the less you have the less you give away the more free you are why do we need all this stuff why do we need to burden ourselves when we can't search the Scriptures Daily now listen message preferred to search the quotes to confirm their base opinions brother brothers Ministry had produced two types of Believers we know there's three types but two right here the bride who wants him to reveal the understanding of the Bible the Mysteries to them and they that they can prove from the scriptures see it's the word that gives you faith not anything else but the word you bring back the scriptures you bring back the quotes back to the scriptures now listen the bride who wants him to reveal they understand the Bible the Mysteries and the foolish virgin who want to exalt him to the godhead so that they can believe their interpretations of his quotes and ignore the hard work of studying and understanding the word of God digging deep into the word the foolish virgins claim that brother Branham is infallible this is a Roman Catherine Doctrine because they say the pope is infallible this Doctrine was announced in 1870 the pope is the figurehead of the Antichrist Spirit brother Brandon speaking here the key to the door 1962 some brethren up there that said I had sent them up there and they that are preaching to men up there should leave their wives and hunt for their spiritual mate and that I am perfectly infallible he goes oh my he said that is some awful things that I've heard that were said about me being infallible would make brother Branham another Pope how awful is that well listen I'm not finished yet William Branham came to give us Revelation on the written word that's it not like people are saying he was God he unveiled the scriptures he unveiled the word what are we talking about what have we been talking about I thought it was Jesus Christ I thought the third poll cannot be impersonated by men think about it that would take us back to the teachings of the original Apostles in the first age we must use his quotes to explain the scriptures and not use his quotes to replace scriptures if his quotes can't be backed up by the word he even said of himself if what I'm saying is not in the word then leave it oh my this is this is very very touchy ground that I can say some things but people will misunderstand let the spirit reveal it to those Hallelujah Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will remain he said also in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the only way we can establish our faith is based on the word of God my brothers and sisters this is the third poll being revealed to the individual this is the spirit of Truth guiding and leading you into all truth Hallelujah I'm going to try to wind this down Hallelujah Hallelujah everything that the that was given to the prophet is given to the bride by the third pull is Sovereign Grace it's given purposely to the individual we need to get our minds out of the way and let the grace come in people find security in gifts because when they pray to God God answers I preach to people God and the people tell me God spoke to me through your preaching I laid hands upon the sick and they were healed but this third pull is not a gift we know speaking in tongues is a gift of the spirit as a manifestation of the spirit but it's not the evidence of the spirit Hallelujah God filtering all these uh wrong opinions and and wrong interpretations under your mind because you cannot produce this word for this hour with these things believe in these things that they're the absolute that's what's taking place right now God filtering all these things out of you we would believe we'd all have to speak in tongues if we believe it sounds stupid doesn't it sounds foolish if we all have to speak in tongues and believe that we had the Holy Ghost it sounds foolish to us now but that's the same thing what I'm saying here all these things I'm saying here Hallelujah Hallelujah the third pull is a part of being born again it comes with repentance so gifts can be dangerous and the more gifts that you have the more you need to ask God to help humble you so you can see the third poll manifest station in your life because it's not connected to gifts or works it's Revelation by God himself we need to stay in the pattern that was shown to us through the prophet's life the third pull came into manifestation through him the same pattern will be repeated again I will ride this Trail again I will ride this perfection in a people in flesh again I will bring the word back and flesh again this word will overcome I will bring Sons and Daughters of God back into manifestation in this day and age there was a pattern that was laid out listen when I when I listen to those tapes at the beginning Hallelujah all I heard all I've seen I didn't even understand but was Christ I've seen a life brother Brandon I didn't even see him I see Jesus Christ I've seen a life amen speaking through the word of God and it was speaking to me I want to manifest in you this is why I called you this is why I'm revealing these things to you amen Hallelujah glory to God oh my there's just so much I'm going to have to we have a church meeting here we want to get to I want to honor that Hallelujah hallelujah we're just going to have to get into the character building later Amen brother Brown says power without character satanic Hallelujah glory to God let us fight the musicians up amen Hallelujah we know about the two stories in the Bible the slave the buyer says you feed him differently do you treat him differently no then why is he so different why does he conduct himself so different it stands so different and walk so different talk so different why is there strength in his back he's got a backbone in other words is because he looks across the sea and he has a father that's King and he knows where he comes from he knows that being a slave in that condition was not him he doesn't identify with that but he identifies back home his home and that's why he conducts himself that way and that's like us the Bride of Jesus Christ we don't identify with this flesh in this world but we look to where our home is and where we come from and that's why we walk and we talk and we live the way we do and we're faithful the dishwasher woman when the kid when the Sun came and looked the rich man's son came and looked for a woman all so many beautiful churches so many beautiful women out there all dolled up and decked out and everything he's seen through the phoniness let me tell you why he called you today because he's seen through all that phoniness your life might have been upside down might have been nothing nobody thinking of you nobody maybe you thinking nothing of yourself but he's seen through all the phoniness out there and he came to you And that son came to that dishwasher woman and said who am I who am I that you would come to me and he said I have been watching I have been indigenously looking and I see character in you I have found character that I like in you [Music] oh my brothers and sisters [Music] what's the third pull doing it's building character in US [Music] the unveiling of God [Music] Moses was veiled by The Living Word of God failed behind human flesh oh brothers and sisters are you catching it this morning congregation says amen we got an amen look don't you see it's been veiled through these ages according to what God has said and it will be open in the last days those Seven Seals would be broke and the full thing will come into into view of the people what's tooken place all along [Music] what John could not write and what has been taken place all down Through the Ages through all their lives will come into plain view in this hour Hallelujah just absolutely the Living Word of God in individuals the unveiling of God so now we are invited into him to be partakers of all that he is which is hid to the unbelievers by the veil of human flesh see they know of that Glory they read of it in his word here the glory of God and the things like that but it's just a word to them but to us it's a manifestation see it's no more a word to the Bride of Jesus Christ it's no more a written word but now it's become a reality oh Hallelujah oh God the third pull unexplainable can't explain it can interpret it you can't do nothing it's just a manifestation it's just the creation of God when God speaks his word God spoke to squirrels was the creation of God we try to work up things that speak things that wasn't brother Brandon working up Creighton squirrels Hattie writes children it wasn't brother Branham saying you know what the Bible says that you know your children are coming they're part of you [Music] that's not what it is you can believe what you want to believe and I respect that that's not what it is that's not the revelation but when he gave that to Hattie Wright God gave it to him and says you give Hattie right whatever she wants it wasn't brother Brown saying how do you write I give you whatever you want God told Brother Branham you give Hattie right whatever she wants that is the right connection here God said to brother Branham how many squirrels do you want I want to let then you I give it to you speak it oh my just walk with God that's the third pull Walking with God Hallelujah I trust it was simple enough for you to understand that God give you something and if not when you leave this place you'll recognize this place is a natural building but there's a supernatural tent that we were in this morning Hallelujah and when you walk out of these this tent amen may you recognize something has changed something has manifested in my life because he brung it father I commit the word into thy hands everything that was said father God they're your people Lord many times your Prophet said Lord I I deliver what was on my heart [Music] now the people are in your hands they can never be in my hands or any man's hands Lord this work that is being done in our lives they're the hands of the Living God Lord Jesus have your way now father manifest yourself to your children and bring them to that place father like Enoch like Abraham and Sarah in Jesus name God bless
