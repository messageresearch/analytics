Morning by the grace of God he sends his greetings and his love to everyone and we'll be hearing from him on Sunday but tonight we're here by the grace of God and those that are here were the ones God wanted to be here they're the ones God is going to bless tonight tonight and give some kind of encouragement through the word of God because I can only um bring to you what the Lord has given me but if you've got faith tonight then you're going to get something a lot more than what you could possibly get from me and on Wednesday nights we do Bible study and um so uh these are opportunities where you can use these messages and again I remind you that they are uploaded to our website they're very current now we we've got somebody that um has dedicated themselves sister Patricia has dedicated herself to um following up on the messages being sure that she gets them that they're being recorded and then get put up to our website so you can use these types of messages on the Wednesday nights they're great opportunities for Bible study for teachings current teachings okay you know it's one thing to bring Bible studies that you can get all kinds of Bible studies you can go online and pick up all kinds of Bible studies but it's a lot different when you're studying the word of God according to the day and the message that God is giving in the present season it's a lot different and this is the one thing that you know that we need to understand that um when we're testifying we're not testifying of just Bible History we're testifying of what God is doing now this is Christianity amen right it's Christ in his church a lot of people forget that it's Christ in his church in the present stage of his ministry remember the Bible is a book of Prophecy it is God for 4,000 years of history in the Old Testament 2,000 years of history in the New Testament from the arrival of Jesus Christ to the present day but yet in that history there's prophecy amen that's right and within that prophecy we need to be able to see the hour the time and the season of what God is going to do in the day that were to me oh
