bless you please be seated we're so happy to see sister Sheila here with us God bless you real good amen [Applause] [Music] welcome to bring one of you here into the house of the Lord and it is our prayer that the great Holy Spirit of almighty God bless each one we know we are living in chaotic time the entire world is undergoing an upheaval of change and transformation and uh where God is preparing everything because we have to our dispensations our times are all changing and we know if we keep our eyes on Israel as God's time clock that things are swinging from the Gentiles back to the Jews and so he's preparing the groundwork and we don't have a Graphic picture of everything that God is doing or will do but we are certainly obedient in following him uh in his word and by the leadership of the great Holy Spirit now I'm standing here now because I will not speak this morning but uh my assistant here brother Danny mozilli how many knows who brother Danny was really is [Applause] brother Danny mozilli will be speaking uh bringing the word of God to you and I know it will be a blessing to you now it's not something I put him up to I don't know what he's going to be speaking on and the spirit gives him whatever he's going to speak on so we are trusting God we have no littonese here we have no um book of yearly sermons to preach that are already made out and dare anybody to divert from that we have no such systems here but we do have the word of God and we have the Holy Spirit here [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] comes on um uh may I say this group or this uh local church is not aligned with any group of note in this message we do not seek anybody's endorsement for credibility or for the propagation of the word we are not engaged in marketing we are not engaged in networking it's good for business it's good for all the natural things that man has to do and if God wants to use it he will use it but we are not purposely consciously putting ourselves in the way we are known by this big brother influential in the message or this one over here that can give you an endorsement no such a thing right we stand with the word of God hallelujah and when I say that within the confines of what we call the message and even outside of those confines we stand with the word of God Amen God wants to associate us with anybody God wants us to know anybody learn anything from anybody but that's wonderful but we are not making any conscious efforts of marketing self-promotion self-production propagation any of those who those who marvelous append directly on the spirit of almighty God Amen and may God bless us all together because we are not here just for church as we call it Church but when we come into this building we come into the presence of a supreme this Supreme Being this is not a joke we come in here and he brother Branham said he gets here before you do and he is waiting for you to walk in these doors or in your prayer closet wherever you meet him he's already there right so uh when we come here the mystery of Fellowship is something Supernatural amen once you take it ordinary you know it's not this Sunday morning you run to church go with your Bible get the message or whatever then you're you're coming out of the supernatural element of it and I want to keep you as this church under that influence of the supernatural element of the power and presence of God Amen just like the apostles have it amen and when we are like that anything can happen at any time [Applause] at any time we don't know it it could be a child could suddenly God could use it could be a woman it could be a man we don't know we are surrendered to the will and the purpose of God amen amen I want you to know that for sure so that there's no guesswork going on here no questioning uh no doubting nothing that you have to wonder about we are united as one in Christ amen may the Lord bless your real good we're going to invite uh brother Danny to come those of you who know him those of you who don't know him I presented you brother Danny mazzily [Applause] praise God God bless you Saints it's certainly good you may be seated for a moment there we go okay we got it just need to plug in oh there's one on the pulpit oh yes good thanks brother Mike it's been a while and um you may notice it today that it's been a while but by the grace of God we're here and we're very very grateful for the words of our pastor there that just came forth because I am a big fan of the supernatural and the presence of the Lord and that um we are we are led by the spirit we operate by the Holy Spirit we are a supernatural Church it's the one thing that um I can testify all day long that that's that's why I'm here that's why a lot of you are here too is because of the supernatural intervention of the Lord at a particular time in your life and here you are some of us just a few years some of us a quarter Century already right but we're still here and we still believe the same we're just as excited about the word of God as we were when when we first heard it because he's a living God Amen he's a present God you know one of the greatest scriptures that that became life to me when I first came to the Lord was uh they that thirst after the Living God and and it was it was something that burned within my heart I needed to see God I needed to know that it was real I had been through too many faults uh situations and and trying to find that you know that that that element where you know that it's real and but it would always end up being some sort of a scam or something behind it or some you know uh coming to know the Lord then you find out that it was just it was it was witchcraft there was a lot of things that were going on that were just taking us further away from God but this message is God Amen is God Amen praise God so um this morning uh you know it's been about a year and a half since I've been up here so please bear with me I may be a little bit Rusty but by the grace of God I want to get completely out of the way and I want to let the Holy Spirit speak to our lives to our hearts to our needs you know one of the things that was Heavy upon my heart over the last few months and I knew that this was coming like I knew this was coming I just didn't know when but I know when the Lord starts to do certain things and reveal certain things and inspiration starts falling then something is going on and and by the grace of God then all we can do is just bring what he gives us amen praise God so before we do that uh let's pray let's pray father it is truly a privilege Lord and we don't in any way shape or form count this as something common or simple we know that you're hidden in Simplicity but we know that your presence is awesome it is real to us it is what we Thrive and live upon father as Sons and Daughters of God and this morning we come yielded vessels each and every one of us father Lord we want to put aside everything that is of this world everything that that is so heavy Upon Our Hearts and our minds circumstances family issues Financial pressures Lord there's so many things that That Could That Could hinder us this morning but we're asking you to raise a standard and allow us to move into Heavenly places now through the word of God so that we may enter in and receive something that will Lord we will We Will Rejoice for days and and forever Lord knowing that your your spirit came and spoke to our need and and gave us a new start a new opportunity a fresh start a Deliverance a healing whatever it is that Lord that you're more than able to do today Father may you do it in the name of Jesus Christ Lord and All For Your Glory and for your honor and for your grace and mercy Lord strengthen our pastor Lord touch his body Lord renew refresh strengthen oh God keep him vibrant Lord every single day of his life father we are so thankful and so blessed Lord to have such leadership and Revelation that pours in and through this ministry thank you so much for it father we love you we appreciate you Lord remember those that are not here with us today remember those that are visiting today Lord you can speak to every heart and every life from the child to the oldest we commit this service into your hands in Jesus name amen praise God let's go to the first scripture let's all stand in honor of Our Lord Psalms chapter 46 verse 10 a very familiar scripture the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge come Behold The Works of the Lord what desolations he hath made in the earth he maketh Wars to cease unto the end of the Earth he breakth the bow and cutteth the spear in Sunder he burneth The Chariot in fire be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the Earth the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge you may be seated next slide today I want to talk to you about walking with God through a pandemic you know here we are we're we're almost two years into this pandemic there's been a lot of things happening in the world and in your lives today I want to talk about this personal walk because this walk is between you and God though we are in the midst of a pandemic though the world is falling apart in many ways many situations that are taking place around us yet we as the sons and the daughters of God the children of God I'm going to need water are walking with God in this pandemic we're not walking alone we're not to to get too caught up with this pandemic and and turn it into something more than what it is and forget about what God did in your life what God did in calling you in preparing you and bringing you into this Revelation that that you are now walking with God amen praise God next slide this Coronavirus is a plague it is it is a disease that's come upon the Earth how would God hear my God there's so many different controversies it was started here it was it was deliberately done I can tell you it was deliberately done by Satan himself too many people are getting caught up into these controversies and thinking that oh you know these people and and it was this this group and this that listen Satan is the God of this evil age we're living in the last days we're living in a time where we're going to see what's the difference between between coronavirus and cancer they both kill what's the difference between all those different diseases they're all diseases but the Lord has not changed he's still the Lord God that healeth all all every one of our diseases amen praise God forevermore so it's not coronavirus it's not cancer it's not Bell's palsy it's not uh diabetes it's not heart failure it's the devil [Applause] and there is a God that said I am the Lord I heal I give I take oh if you get that vaccination you're going to die I said is that right I got the vaccination I'm still here I'm living well I had a little sore arm big deal it didn't matter to me what they were injecting I said listen if they force me to go into a room tie me up and inject me with the most venomous snake Venoms on Earth and I had no choice they'd see a smile on my face they would not see fear because the lord giveth the lord taketh blessed be the name of the Lord we have read about too many testimonies of how God can stop death how God can reverse death how God can heal the sick raise the dead there's too many testimony listen nobody can convince me that that God is changing that all of a sudden we're in 2021 in the middle of a pandemic and we're all going to die it ain't going to happen not to Sons and Daughters of God not to those that live by faith we are not to be governed by fear we are to be governed by the word of God it is God's word listen it to Brother Brian he says here in in accepting this message I want you to take note it says accepting God's provided way at the end time that's the title of the message 1963. accepting he says now some of them said well now if the plague Falls we'll just go in the hospital if the plague if the plague happens to fall you know what we'll do we'll go get Dr Jones he'll know how to take care of it it didn't work yet they were smart oh they've got smart vaccinations now they've got things that can go into your body that can you know create any bodies to attack certain foreign this and that they're smart they're they're so intelligent the scientific world is reaching Heights and and areas where they're they're tapping into things that it almost looks Supernatural what they're doing there was a prophet that said there's nothing new Under the Sun there's nothing new Under the Sun everything that is happening is for the purpose of the Fulfillment of Prophecy God has prophecy for the end time we happen to be a part of that prophecy you need to recognize what part of the prophecy you are so that you can recognize where you are going to fit and once you see the part that God has called you to to fulfill you're not going to be you're not going to be worried and and governed by fear anymore because God has revealed to you that you are a son of God that you're an overcomer that no plague shall harm thee no no no no poisonous thing shall hurt thee so you don't have to worry if you're if you're gonna go get the vaccination go get it you're a son or daughter God what are you worried about you're worried that it's going to kill you you worry that it's gonna Mark you you're worried that it's the mark of the beast you I don't know what what kind of scam that is get back to the word and read what the word says go back and see what the prophet said he said here he said he'll know how to take care of it it didn't work yet they were smart well if the plague Falls we'll just go down beneath the ground in a cave and shut the door down that won't do it one bit of good he says we'll stay in the house and put a mask over our face and put some disinfectant on it didn't do a bit of good God made a provided way yes and it was what the blood Hallelujah I'm so glad that he allowed the blood to be poured upon my life and that I could take it I could I could apply it to my home I could apply it over my door I could apply it to my children I can apply it to my job I could apply it to my life to my health to my wealth to everything it was God's provided way in the end time but you've got to accept it too many people getting caught up not realizing that they're rejecting the word when they start to speak fear they start to speak oh this is going to happen that's going to happen if we don't do this this is going to happen we're not to be fanatical and go out there and say I'm a Son of God I'm I'm protected nothing can hurt me I don't care what you say you guys this what is that that's that's fanaticism the other way you see Walking with God is simple it's in the middle of a pandemic here we are and yet we can still walk with god without fear Hallelujah next slide the problem is right now there's too many distractions it's constant listen you got to be careful about tuning into the news every minute of the day too many people are caught up in that you got to be careful you start listening so much to that news and all it's doing is putting fear on the people fear you don't do this this is going to happen you do that this is going to happen you don't you got you cannot get caught into that as Sons and Daughters of God if you listen the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against revelation that means whatever Satan whatever he lies whatever he tells you whatever they're saying out there if you've got to realize here this is a supernatural element this is the supernatural this is what a lot of Christians Listen a lot of Christian churches out there okay but this remember what we said at the beginning we came in contact with the Living God when Jesus was on Earth he was the Living God things happened around him that didn't happen anywhere else all the churches that were there at the time they were all kinds of different interpretations but wherever Jesus was there was life there was healing there was raised from the dead there was Supernatural taking place and where is he today where are you putting him today if you're not putting him into your present day life right now right now in the midst of a pandemic then you're going to get caught up into these lies and into these deceptions and you're going to be in in this state of fear when you should be in a state of victory Hallelujah too many voices too many distractions amen research you know what research is showing and this is probably a little old 53 percent of adults are reporting that mental health is declining people are going cuckoo because they're listening to too many voices Satan's purpose and and he's the author of confusion so what does he want to do he wants to get you all confused he wants you one one day I'm getting the vaccine I'm not getting it I'm gonna get it if I get it I'm gonna die my God it's it's unbelievable I'm just using that as an example you can apply that to whatever situation in your life that you're dealing with right now whether it's health wealth uh for relationships whatever it is you've got to put God in the middle of it and you've got to say Lord this is your promise you are the Lord God that that healeth you're the Lord God that gives peace there's there's there's havoc in my home right now I want peace Lord according to your word let the peace of God fall whatever it is take your position as a Son of God marriages relationships they're being significantly and permanently damaged because of this pandemic it is separating people left right and Center don't tell me that you didn't get you you didn't see that separation coming in around your life where all of a sudden you know your family is starting to look at you funny you're you're you know like what you believe and and and then and then it's constant it's constant uh you know pressure now well you know my sister says that I shouldn't go visit my parents because you know we haven't got our vaccination yet and you know we don't want to kill them and like it's it's it's constant and then all of a sudden you know you're arguing with your siblings I want to go see no you shouldn't go you're this you're that no this is real this is what's going on this is the kind of stuff that happens when you walk with God in the middle of a pandemic that's right right you see that's separating the people it's breaking Fellowship it's it's even moved into the Realms of this message saying oh if you get coronavirus you're serpent seed so what does it mean when you get a cold what happens if somebody gets diabetes what's the difference coronavirus cancer common cold what is it you see how you see we got to wake up we got to just come out of this we got to wake up and we got to stand where we are supposed to stand in our positions as Sons and Daughters of God Hallelujah we've got the most powerful weapon which is prayer I thank God for our prayer group for our Prayer Ministry it has been such a blessing I can tell you right now uh I'm gonna Advocate that it never goes back to in the church services for prayer meetings because we've never had such great attendance and such powerful results people you know because listen we're living in a world where time is so valuable people you know that extra day during the week to drive an hour and a half to come to a prayer meeting some of us live distance away and everything else and the power that God is blessing it God is blessing it thank you what's wrong with that there's God is is not okay we do need to assemble and we will assemble here whenever we can on Sundays on Wednesday nights as the Lord Wills by the grace of God but I'm seeing something in the prayer meetings that I know a lot of you have seen and a lot of you have testified back saying that that it's just been a tremendous blessing and so this powerful prayer that God has given us that we should constantly be fueling that if there's anything you want to improve and do more of in the midst of this pandemic is prayer we don't do it enough there's too many distractions the you know it says a life full of prayer will lead to a life that is full God answers prayer God can't God God can't make a promise and then not keep it do you understand so you can count on it amen praise God you know and then you got to wait like it says in Isaiah sometimes we pray and we don't get the answer right away it takes time things you you got to give things time they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength I know for a fact that when situations are really tough we all have them saints we we all have them I've had some recently come on everybody's Adam you're facing something in your life all I know is that when when I take it to prayer and and and their sincerity and then there's a group that that's even behind it strength comes back cannot explain it all the situation doesn't change it may not be completely answered the way we want it but yet strength comes back and you're and all of a sudden you're back on the field you're you're ready to go again you're ready to overcome you're you're you're confident that God can do it amen praise God next slide what is it we're walking with God in a pandemic let us not forget we are walking with god let's look at somebody that walked with God Amen you know a simple walk next slide who would have thought that that you know a simple walk would have become so you know so much of a luxury you know while the pandemic was on people were looking forward to that walk every day they you know because they were stuck at home their jobs their businesses were shut down and they were taking a walk and they were walking because they needed to do something they needed to do some exercise and it was a luxury it was something that they enjoyed you know even us we would go out we would take that walk and it would just be you know we'd look forward to it and we'd be doing it like almost every day whenever we could and and it was just good you know it was something to to help the day get through and and everything else you know there's benefits from it you know it's great to go for walks I always you know Pastor Simon oh I'm going for my walk going for my walk you know he'd always be taking walks take his stick he'd go for walks there was a reason to it and look 75 or 76 and he's like 36. there's benefits that you can benefit from from doing physical exercise it's a great thing you will look better you will feel better it's there's just no but it doesn't change God's time for your life because to every thing there is a time and a season but you can like that's what I've always believed you can always live better you could always live wealthier you can always live closer to God even in your walk you can have a closer walk with God while you're here on Earth it all what you sow what you sow you're going to reap what you put into your relationships you're going to reap you see it's all about sowing and reaping in this Dimension and that will never change that will never change so you can benefit from all of those things but here now I'm talking about a simple walk so let's go to the next and we'll look at Genesis 5 21-24 we've we've heard of Enoch you know I believe that we are a perfect type of Enoch you that have done your studies and looked through the scriptures and looked at the life of Enoch you'll know that he parallels the Bride of Jesus Christ the church the current Ministry of Jesus Christ here on the earth because Enoch like it says here lived 65 years and begot Methuselah after he begot Methuselah Enoch walked with God he walked with God you know that those if you go back and look at those times and those days when were in the days of Enoch in the days when all those things there was a lot of things going on and civilization was probably even more advanced than it is now he built a pyramid that to this day they cannot even possibly fathom how he did it mathematically equipment wise how those those stones fit so perfect how they were measured so perfect how it was placed directly in the center of the earth latitude longitude all the aptitudes and everything else and how this this pyramid is so perfect what is it it's God it was God in Enoch God was in Enoch and Enoch was walking with God and God is in you as a son or a daughter of God and you're walking with God and there's benefits to walking 300 years he had sons and daughters so all the days of Enoch were 365 years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him well praise God you know when you look at Enoch and you look at even even the word like his name Enoch it signifies to instruct to initiate to dedicate he was dedicated disciplined from his conduct we can see that he was early instructed in the things of God you know you're blessed you young people that you've been early instructed in the things of God because those are the things that will last those are the things that will make a difference in your life down the road those are the things that will change circumstances in your life because you were early taught the things of God and instructed in the things of God initiated into the worship of his maker and dedicated to his service it is but little that is recorded concerning him but this little is enough to make his name great greater than the name of the other Enoch who had a city called by his name because there was another Enoch amen I'm going to need some kleenex the box is empty here there was another Enoch that was the son of Cain that was a different Enoch this one came through the lineage of God through Seth because Adam had Abel Abel was killed Seth was the replacement for Adam because of the lineage of God because God's lineage was not going to run through Cain who was whose whose father was the serpent it was going to run through Adam Eve Adam and Eve and then Seth was the replacement for Abel and then from Seth down to the seventh came Enoch he will find him in the lineage of the original Adam from The Garden of Eden amen praise God and that's that's who you are from we are the Seed of Abraham it all comes down next slide so Enoch walked with God amen the world condition must have gotten so bad it was unfitting to leave him here any longer so God took him praise God God took him because the world's condition got so bad things got so bad that he couldn't leave Enoch on the earth anymore Enoch was so filled with the Holy Ghost so filled with the instruction of the Lord so inspired that he built the the Great Pyramid he wrote everything that was going to happen in that pyramid you know we're not going to get into that if you ever get a chance you want to go and study the Great Pyramid of Giza you will find out uh the the just how remarkable how remarkable that pyramid was in the way that Enoch built it but the key principles that we want to look at here is that Enoch walked with God he didn't walk with the with the with the scientists of the day he didn't walk with the podcasts every day oh new podcast coming up ready to listen in to hear what the next Scandal is in the Earth you know he didn't live with those with with the newscasters the naysayers he lived and walked with God and he was he was at work he was doing whatever he was doing and because he was walking with God he was constantly being inspired amen it was constant inspiration that was coming to him constantly about what was happening what was to come what was going on around him he was given the spirit of Prophecy he had the spirit of Prophecy upon him because he walked with God every single day now walking with God as a Christian doesn't mean that you're constantly with the Bible in your hand you go to work the first thing you do to break you sit down at break time you open your Bible you look at everybody else at the table why aren't you reading the word you know you're going to go to hell if you don't read the word that's not walking with God that's not the kind of walk Walking with God is simple god listen just go back and look at when Jesus was on the Earth he didn't go in right up into the priests and says I am the Lord come down from I am the Messiah I come here and I want the pulpit move aside everybody are you kidding he was so humble he was so simple he would walk with the public and he would just walk with the with the tax collectors he would even a prostitute joined his group and he says come come no problem he said he says I didn't come for the for those that had no need of a physician I come for those that need a physician I come for those that need healing I come for those that are that are seeking because if they seek they're going to find [Music] Hallelujah glory to God that's the kind of walk with God that's simple it's not it's you don't have to make it anymore that you just got to do what you do every day but do it with God start the day and say Lord Lead Me Guide Me direct me inspire me let me Lord let me see the traps that may be laid before me in my home and my family whatever it is you want to walk with God you've got a huge Advantage Walking with God yeah next slide it's hard to please God as a human it's hard you are going to make mistakes you are going to get tired grumpy your wife is going to get on your nerves your husband's gonna get on your nerves your children are going to get on your nerves your boss is going to get on your nerves you're going to have situations that are going to get on your nerves and you're gonna you're gonna do things that are not pleasing you're gonna say things that are not pleasing sometimes thank God for the blood of Christ because it's the blood that keeps us it's the blood that that saves us on a daily basis from from from this human realm that we fight with every single day but we we got to recognize that pleasing God is not being perfect pleasing God sometimes is repenting is getting on your knees is is is is forgiving others is doing unto others as you would want done to yourself pleasing God is receiving revelation and living it you can't please the Bible says in Hebrews it is impossible to please God without faith without faith in other words God reveals to you why you love to serve him he reveals to you and blesses you in so so many ways that you just you can't you can't you can't love him enough you can't love him enough not because he did something for you it's because you know that he's always going to be there he's always going to meet your need regardless regardless of the circumstances situation God will always be there for you we want to try and please God by putting on works we want to we want to work this up and work that up that does not please God it's impossible to do it without faith and so many people try and and and do works and and and and and claim works and project works and and oh while we do this and we do that so we deserve this and we deserve that that's not the way you please God there's only one way that you please God and that's when you've received faith in your heart as a son or a daughter of God and in the midst of a pandemic in the midst of people falling from the left to the right and everything else you were there and you are serving him you are believing him you are you are trusting him regardless of the circumstances that pleases God when he sees you fall on your face weeping and crying in the midst of Despair and you are you've you know that you're at your weakest point he says that's when I'm the strongest in your life that pleases God because that's his word Hallelujah next slide says Enoch was a witness for God but it was because of Revelation that's what separates us Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him now the Holy Spirit instead of saying Enoch lived says Enoch walked with God for it is the life of a good man to walk with God this was one the business of Enoch's life his constant care and work while others live to themselves in the world he lived to God you see he he did it for God the boss comes and says you do this you do that you do this or you're going to get fired but Enoch he went and did this did that do this for God Amen and two weeks later his boss got fired you understand it's not what we think it's what we believe it's what we it's what we know by Revelation that God is in control God operates the church God leads and directs the leadership in the church to do certain things and to act in certain ways God has a purpose behind it all we need to recognize and not be too overwhelmed by by by personalities by by uh positions by titles we need to sit back and pray not gossip not say this and say that we need to believe God we need to pray we need to know that God is in control because we have a revelation of God lived for themselves he lived for God since he did not live like the rest so he did not die like the rest Hallelujah no plague is going to take you and let me just say that if by chance you know a lot of people oh this brother died from the Coronavirus oh yes he had a heart condition and he had this and he had that but they say died from the from the corona no he died because it was his time amen he died because it was his time God can use anything what when somebody dies of cancer all of a sudden what's the difference like I I try to keep things simple in my mind so I don't want to get confused here so and I don't want you to be confused I want you to understand that that the Lord gives and the Lord takes he does not change God will do what he has planned from before the foundations of the world you're here for a purpose you're here to fulfill that purpose you want to line up in your mind with that purpose you because that's where you're that's where faith is by the way perfect faith is only found when you're in your position that's why those listen don't be running from the church don't be running from the body of Christ don't be leaving this body you need to get into the body you need to get into your position because when you're in your position the blood flows right through your veins you ever take an organ out of a body put it on a table it'll beat you take a heart out of somebody's chest put it on the table leave it there for seven minutes it stops it's dead it's done it's finished okay no more nourishment no more drying from the from the body the the edification that comes from the body no more uh you know strength that that you that you that you you don't you don't understand you know you you leave the body and then all of a sudden you think you're still going to be strong no not if God puts you here and if God needs you as a son or a daughter of God and takes you from this local body you better be connected to some other body because if not there's something wrong let's keep it straight here there's there's a local Body of Christ there's sons and daughters that have been called for a purpose into each body that God has set up from before the foundations of the world with a pastor a leader guidance leadership and all those things and when you're in that body and you're operating in that body and you're standing in your position even in the middle of a pandemic a lot of people got a big break because of the pandemic they didn't have to do anything they forgot about church they barely tune in once a week if it was convenient I'll watch it later it's recorded anyway not realizing there's nourishment that the Holy Spirit he's a supernatural God he's still feeding the body this is where he feeds the body this is how he feeds the body this is how he nourishes edifies instructs gives confidence puts Faith gives gives leadership gives Vision gives you know without Vision you perish that's what the scripture says you need leadership you need guidance you need Vision to be in in you know in in you know placed on You by the word of God Faith cometh by hearing by hearing the word hallelujah glory to God Amen next slide Hebrews 11 it says by faith Enoch that's how it starts by faith Enoch not John walked with God Philip work walked with God Jennifer walked with God Abraham walk with God it's one thing anybody can say I'm walking with God but it's different when it's by faith by faith he knew that God was real that God was present God was in his life even in the midst of a pandemic God is right there walking talking revealing he was taken up so that he did not see death and was not found because God had taken him for before he had taken he had this testimony that he pleased God we're going into Rapture you know that the message of this hour is preaching the body change that the that the five-fold ministry right now what God is doing through the five-fold ministry is actually speaking revelation of the rapture in many different ways because remember it's the Revelation that rides the word that's what has an effect on you not the actual words that you see but it's the actual spirit of God writing into Julie's heart speaking into our sister's heart here speaking personally telling them exactly what he has what what what's happening in their lives what's being changed around them why these circumstances are happening why the children are such a burden in so many areas why this that because God is testing you God is causing you to overcome God is delivering you from your unbelief because unbelief is when you when you start speaking things oh God gave me Serpent seed you know you know you get you get so upset you start looking at your children you start looking at all the circumstances oh God doesn't Prosper me look at the bills are going higher again this month that's not faith God is testing you so that you can speak even in the midst of the storm even in the midst of the pandemic you can still say he is the Lord God that provideth all of my needs he is Jehovah Jireh he provided I don't need to look at my boss I don't need to look at the company because they got affected by the virus they're going to shut down so what there's another job waiting for you you are a son or a daughter of God you've got to claim your position you've got to stand in your post where God has placed you in this day you are that witness you're the witness in the midst of this pandemic right here in the City of Burlington we are the witness we are the ones that regardless of the circumstances we will stand and we're not going to stand on our own abilities we're not going to stand on our own ideas we're Standing on the Promises of God's word he pleased God but without faith look right in the same scripture he goes you know he had a testimony that he pleased God and you think oh praise God you know I've been going to church every Sunday and I've been doing everything you know he pleased God I must be pleasing God and then God turns around and says yeah but without faith foreign without faith it's impossible to please me so stop your works stop your you know works are good like don't get me wrong here okay you know there's there's like you know you've got to have good works you got to have good works you got to have good habits you got bad habits you need 21 days against that habit you'll break it that's that's known okay if you've got a certain habit you want to stop that habit you want to break that habit you want to break you know you you know foul mouth whatever it is go 21 days Go 21 days you'll break that habit it just it's something that happens it's part of our makeup okay so there is good habits you want to get into the habit of attending service you want to get into the habit of praying and seeking the Lord every single day you want to get into the habit of catching any portion of the word that you can catch whether it's a daily scripture or whether it's a Bible verse or whether it's one chapter of the Bible whatever it is wherever you can grab one because one word from God I've caught one word from God I was driving in my car one day and one word dropped into my heart I don't know where in the world it came from but I knew it came from God because all of a sudden I'm rejoicing I'm weeping I'm crying I'm saying wow Hallelujah because God can do anything amen God can reveal at any time God can you don't limit his ability in your life Saints we're in a pandemic but we're walking with God amen glory to God God must be listen it is impossible to please him for he who comes to God must believe that he is isn't that what we're talking about here that he's present right now he's here today amen I don't know if there's visitors here today listen you're in the presence of God if you're this the first time you've been here today you are in the presence of God and all things are possible in his presence I can promise you that you can you can just just be sincere in your heart be be be honest for the first time if you haven't been honest with yourself in a while and say Lord I need help I I need to change I don't want to stay this way anymore I want this thing gone in my life you can receive it today in the name of Jesus Christ because he's here his word he cannot fail Hallelujah we know that he is that he is present amen and that he is a rewarder of those who what diligently seek him oh won't you seek him today won't you seek the Lord today Hallelujah listen to The Prophet here next slide he says as I've often made this remark and said God made three Bibles the first one he put in the sky the Zodiac did you ever see the zodiac what is the first figure in the Zodiac the Virgin what is the last figure in the zodiac Leo the Lion he come the first time through the Virgin he comes the second time as the lion of the tribe of Judah he made the next one in the pyramid back in the days of Enoch when they made that pyramid and they measured them I don't understand it but to the wars where there they stoop and go on their knees for so long and can measure the distance of the wars you know where they measure to now Plum across the king's chamber and as this pyramid went up he could not build he could not build it with everything that we got today we couldn't build it why because it was God Enoch's life and this is all a type of your life it cannot be replicated it cannot be explained don't try to explain your peculiar life the way God designed you God designed you for a purpose and God designed Enoch to be the Fulfillment of Prophecy even into the last days amen praise God the next slide the word pyramid when translated from Hebrew to English actually means Revelations measured that pyramid was in such Perfection that even to the very inches to the very to each and every chamber everything was so perfectly written in there what is it saying that your life is perfectly written before God your whole walk is a progressive walk with God and it's a progression it's a progression of Revelation upon Revelation line upon line precept upon precept you will overcome you will you will prevail you will overcome this pandemic this thing will go at some point either it will go or we will go but it will not have any effect on your life unless you allow it to have an effect on your life you need to decide today you need to make that decision today whether you are going to allow these these these circumstances all these elements that are constantly bombarding you to to affect you to bring you down to get you uh depressed mental oppression is at levels that I have never seen I'm actually watching the way I talk to people nowadays thinking my God you know because I can be a little bit bold and you know the way I talk sometimes and I gotta really pull back I got to say wow you know like I got to be careful because people just boom they fly off the handle just like that you know and and it's because of the pressure you know it's the pressure that that's out there it's the constant pressure you know of of everything around them because they don't know what's going to happen they hear one thing one day the next day it's different then it's different then it's they're so confused they're becoming so oppressed people are just committing suicide because it's just too much they figure and and remember Satan will try and use this to get you to just don't care be careful of that don't care spirit I don't care I don't care if you don't care make sure you just don't care about the lies of the devil but care for others show them you care love them project the love of God that's who we are that's that's that's what we're made of Jesus when he walked on the earth they they couldn't see anything but love coming off of him you listen to the prophet of God that God sent us William Branham you listen to him just you know like when you get a chance go back and listen to that message accepting God's provided way for the end time 1963. I've got a lot of inspiration from there and you'll be really blessed if you listen to it now after hearing this message because there's nuggets in there that God says I have a provided way for you Anthony I have it for you brother I have it for you brother Gabriel I have a brother Bill I've got it for you Michael I've got a provided way he says accept it you got to accept it be careful don't get so distracted by the things in this world and everything else I've got to provide a way for you that that you will get through this end time God provided one for each and every one of those Patriarchs that when Moses faced the Red Sea God had a provided way when Joshua had to cross over God didn't give him a bridge God just gave him power in the name of Jesus Christ God gave Joshua what he had need of he had the he said I need light sun stands still in the name of Jesus it had to stay still because God has a provided way and when you tap into that provided way you tap into your position as a son or daughter of God you can overcome anything mental oppression go back to Hell from where you came from depression go back to Hell from where you came from Financial Financial uh burdens go to hell from where you came from the Lord is my God he wants to prosper me he has plans for me he's got great plans for you Hallelujah he's going to prosper you through this pandemic receive it in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] we are God's Bible today we are God's voice today and we are prophesying and calling the resurrection of the sons and the daughters of the Living God through this anointed word because the mighty Angel has come down he has possessed this five-fold ministry he is calling sons and daughters get into your position get into your office get back to the word of God where God can bless you strengthen you and take you from this dimension Hallelujah and closing here let's read two more quotes and then we close now we find out that Enoch come into God's provided way with his word and walked 500 years and pleased no not 500 but he walked for 365 years and pleased him and we find out that the mechanics was so perfect in him that when the Dynamics got to working in the engine it just took him off the Earth it took the first airplane flight to Heaven working on God's mechanics and Dynamics coming together he was not because God took him out of the earth without death Hallelujah that's exactly right he was walking in God's provided way amen glory to God Amen he was walking with god listen there's a dynamical power that's in you and when the mechanics start to come together with the Dynamics you start to place that word you start to put yourself where you're supposed to be that's the mechanics if you're out of the body right now you're not feeding on the body you're not receiving you're not you're rejecting whatever it is you're the mechanics are all off Dynamics can't come can't hit you right there in your position and fuel you with the word of God fuel you with inspiration to fulfill your part in the word of God the Dynamics and the mechanics must come together next quote in conclusion he says let's take another man with that quickening power there was a man Way Long Ago by the name of Enoch when a new thing come along when something come along and said well now we have to go back to the old school or this that or the other Enoch said I'm walking with God you're going to be taken into prisons you're going to be put into concentration camps you're going to be told that you know that this whole pandemic is is you know is all designed in a way you know to bring control in the world this and that it's all Satan's Eden it's got nothing to do with you heard the same things you know what he said I'm walking with God he said I'll walk with God and whatever God said do Enoch never missed one word he walked with God what was he he was a son of God he was an eagle that had been called to that day and you are called to this day this is your day he was full of that quickening power and when it come time for the old man to die God just sent down the ladder and he walked on up home he quickened him and took his mortal body up in a rapture amen that's that quickening power let's all stand let the musicians come do you believe it this morning are you going to leave here different today you're in a pandemic but you're walking with God there's a big difference we thank the Lord Jesus father we are so grateful this morning Lord for your word your promises these are not our words father these are your words

our week that lays before us meet every need father as we we commit all things now into your hands in Jesus name amen God bless you Saints go ahead brother Pastor Simon amen amen you know I was kind of uh disappointed and surprised when people who claim to be Believers talk about just trusting God and not having any vaccination and they're gonna just trust God and the blood and all that stuff not realizing um that you've got to do your best and then let God do the rest and faith is not Folly rather Brandon's kids sick he run them to the doctor they get cold just a cold gone to the doctor it's not that he didn't have faith but you use the things that are right here in front of you aim amen and not only that oh I take the vaccine and they're going to put change your DNA they're going to do this they're just going to happen that's going to happen the Bible tells you claim if you're a believer if you drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt you so they can inject whatever they want it doesn't make difference to the True Believer you just keep walking with God Amen right through the whole pandemic walk with God in the midst of Babylon like Danielle walk with you know that oh God
