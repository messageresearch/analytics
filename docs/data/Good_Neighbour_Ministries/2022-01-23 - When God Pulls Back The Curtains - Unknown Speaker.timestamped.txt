[17:14] blessed be the name of the lord
[17:18] well
[17:19] many years ago
[17:22] my wife and i
[17:24] once
[17:26] visited
[17:29] a beautiful concert hall
[17:35] to enjoy the artistry
[17:38] of a marvelous
[17:40] christian group
[17:42] of singers
[17:44] called the blind bo five blind boys of
[17:48] alabama
[17:50] and there we
[17:52] sat
[17:54] in the semi-darkness
[17:56] of the
[17:58] great
[17:59] concert hall
[18:03] the curtains were closed
[18:07] the place was in
[18:09] semi-darkness
[18:11] when suddenly
[18:15] the curtains were pulled
[18:18] back
[18:19] and the artists the flying five blind
[18:22] boys came into view
[18:26] the lights came on
[18:29] the music came
[18:31] and the singing
[18:34] began
[18:35] oh it was wonderful uh artistry
[18:40] to see and to hear and to experience
[18:45] what was
[18:46] going on with them and what they could
[18:50] do
[18:51] you see
[18:53] before they
[18:54] began the curtains were closed
[18:59] but when they were ready
[19:02] to display their artistry
[19:05] uh their greatness
[19:08] uh they wanted to demonstrate
[19:12] what was in them
[19:14] then
[19:16] the curtains were pulled apart
[19:20] and
[19:22] they turned on the light
[19:24] and there they were in plain view with
[19:29] clapping and rejoicing
[19:32] because here were these
[19:35] wonderful artists
[19:38] well
[19:40] let's read from genesis
[19:42] chapter one verses one two three
[19:48] another great artist the greatest of all
[19:53] in the beginning
[19:55] god created
[19:57] the heaven and the earth
[20:01] and the earth
[20:02] was without form and void
[20:07] and darkness
[20:10] was upon the face of the deep
[20:14] and the spirit of god
[20:17] moved upon the waters
[20:20] face of the waters
[20:22] and god said
[20:25] let there be light
[20:27] and there was
[20:29] light
[20:31] let us pray
[20:32] as we come to the lord's
[20:35] great
[20:37] table of his feast of this last day
[20:41] that we may partake of the bread of life
[20:45] our loving
[20:47] eternal father
[20:50] we come with our souls rejoicing
[20:55] we come with our hearts ready
[20:58] to receive what you have in store for us
[21:03] oh loving father
[21:05] we come home to thee
[21:08] and now
[21:09] your children
[21:11] want to sit around your throne
[21:14] sit at your feet lord
[21:17] and to receive the bread of life from
[21:22] the lips of our lord jesus christ by the
[21:25] holy spirit bless us together we pray
[21:29] with thankful hearts in jesus name
[21:33] amen and amen
[21:36] glory be to god hallelujah
[21:40] so
[21:42] they pulled back the curtains
[21:45] when they wanted to bring these great
[21:48] artists into view
[21:50] now
[21:53] i had already
[21:55] written down this topic
[21:59] and a few days ago started to
[22:02] work on this
[22:05] when i was moved to
[22:09] go into my
[22:11] library
[22:13] and there i was
[22:16] looking for
[22:19] a certain bit of information
[22:22] but while i was
[22:24] looking for that my hand
[22:27] fell on a book
[22:30] and i looked to see what it is i touched
[22:34] and there
[22:37] i felt
[22:38] to open that book so i opened it
[22:42] and when i opened the book
[22:46] my friends
[22:48] there was the very scene
[22:52] of this message
[22:53] that i had written
[22:56] on the page of that book
[22:59] at least
[23:01] uh
[23:02] 15
[23:03] 20 years ago
[23:06] and it is this
[23:08] when god rolls back the curtains
[23:13] and it came because at the time
[23:17] i read
[23:19] this marvelous
[23:21] quotation
[23:23] from brother william marion branham
[23:26] this great servant and prophet
[23:29] of the living god
[23:33] and
[23:34] this
[23:34] is what he said
[23:38] it was in the month of march
[23:42] 1945
[23:45] one morning
[23:47] around 3 am
[23:51] that our lord jesus christ
[23:54] gave me a vision
[23:58] and he has done that many times
[24:03] at the beginning of this vision
[24:08] i was walking north east
[24:11] on a road
[24:13] when the spirit
[24:14] turned me
[24:17] and pointed me
[24:20] westward
[24:23] i was facing a great mountain
[24:26] it seemed to be the mountain of the lord
[24:33] looking to my left
[24:35] i saw a small heap
[24:38] of smooth
[24:40] fresh
[24:41] baked bread
[24:45] and there were some white fowls
[24:50] standing near
[24:53] the bread
[24:56] but they
[24:57] would not eat much of
[25:01] the bread
[25:03] then the lord said to me
[25:06] do you know them
[25:09] i said
[25:10] no lord
[25:13] then he said
[25:15] this
[25:16] is your tabernacle
[25:21] and
[25:21] they will not eat the bread of life
[25:26] anymore
[25:31] i am sending
[25:33] you
[25:34] now
[25:36] this way
[25:38] then
[25:39] i continued to journey on westward
[25:45] i was then brought to a plane plane
[25:49] and
[25:50] there was a platform erected there
[25:57] seemingly it was under
[26:00] a a tent or or some auditorium
[26:06] there were
[26:07] curtains
[26:09] drawn on the back of that platform
[26:15] and
[26:16] the lord
[26:18] told me
[26:20] he says
[26:21] pull back those curtains
[26:24] oh praise god
[26:27] and when i did
[26:30] i saw a great mountain
[26:34] of bread
[26:36] of of bread the bread of life
[26:42] and then he said
[26:44] go feed them
[26:47] and turning around
[26:49] i saw a lot of
[26:52] white robed people
[26:55] amen
[26:58] coming from everywhere
[27:01] making up a large
[27:04] audience
[27:06] now this is from
[27:09] the first
[27:10] book or booklet
[27:12] that brother branham ever wrote
[27:18] the book that is called
[27:21] i was not disobedient
[27:24] unto the heavenly vision
[27:28] it's not around now as far as i know but
[27:32] a lot of the older brothers may still
[27:34] have
[27:35] copies of it
[27:38] i didn't realize that i even had it
[27:42] and then like i said
[27:45] preparing this message already
[27:48] come down
[27:49] feel urge to come down
[27:51] and my hand fell on this book which was
[27:54] closed
[27:55] and my heart said open it so i opened it
[27:59] and there was this very theme or topic
[28:03] written
[28:04] from around
[28:07] 1981 it was written already on that page
[28:13] my
[28:14] let me
[28:15] quote
[28:17] again
[28:22] god has always in every age
[28:27] he has always hid behind a veil
[28:32] curtains behind a veil
[28:36] through all ages
[28:38] but he's still being god all the time
[28:42] even though he's behind the curtain he
[28:44] is still god
[28:46] all the time
[28:48] but he just kept himself
[28:52] hid from the world
[28:54] and reveals himself to his elected like
[28:58] he did with the apostles at that day
[29:02] now
[29:03] god was in christ speaking in christ
[29:07] you see
[29:09] one of my first books
[29:12] i ever published
[29:15] was called i was not disobedient
[29:19] to the heavenly vision this is 1954
[29:23] and he is referring back to
[29:27] this
[29:28] booklet
[29:30] that he wrote
[29:33] since 1945.
[29:37] now he's referring to it
[29:39] oh
[29:40] praise god
[29:42] now listen
[29:44] 1960
[29:46] help me lord
[29:48] because i sincerely
[29:51] i seek sincerely to know your will
[29:56] that i might
[29:57] bring it
[29:59] do it and bring it
[30:01] as you showed to me
[30:04] many years ago
[30:07] when i left the church
[30:12] the bread of life
[30:14] to all the to the peoples of the world
[30:19] and when i saw that great mountain of
[30:22] bread
[30:24] and them white robe saints
[30:27] coming from all over the earth not fowls
[30:32] but white robbed saints type of the
[30:34] bride
[30:37] they come from all over the earth
[30:40] to eat the this bread of life
[30:43] oh god
[30:46] let me lord let me never fail
[30:49] to feed the people
[30:52] on this bread
[30:54] of life blessed be the name of the lord
[30:58] i just wanted to give you
[31:01] the
[31:02] background
[31:03] that you might understand
[31:06] where it is
[31:08] that i'm coming from
[31:10] that god
[31:12] the great father of light
[31:14] the father of spirits
[31:16] was already living behind
[31:20] a curtain of darkness
[31:24] and when the time came
[31:26] the spirit moved
[31:29] and pulled aside the curtains
[31:33] all blessed be the name of the lord he
[31:37] pulled back the curtains on what on his
[31:40] creation
[31:43] like a great artist
[31:45] will cover
[31:47] his great work
[31:49] with a dark cloth or something
[31:52] from prying eyes
[31:54] and then pulls the
[31:57] that off at the right time
[32:01] and then his great creation
[32:04] comes into plain view
[32:08] and everyone can see
[32:11] what he was working on
[32:15] behind in the shadows
[32:17] he was working on a masterpiece
[32:22] now i want to take you to see
[32:25] god always
[32:27] hides behind curtains
[32:29] hides in simplicity
[32:32] and reveals himself in the same
[32:36] so god
[32:37] with the children of israel
[32:40] god went behind the curtains of the
[32:44] tabernacle
[32:47] and there they saw the great pillar of
[32:50] fire
[32:52] which hung above them
[32:55] suddenly come down
[32:58] and went into the tabernacle
[33:01] and as you know the scripture says the
[33:04] pillar of fire went behind the veil
[33:09] into the holy of holies
[33:12] and that pillar of fire stood
[33:15] right
[33:16] above the
[33:18] ark of the covenant
[33:21] between the wings
[33:24] of the cherubims
[33:27] there was the place of that great pillar
[33:30] of fire
[33:32] all the time
[33:34] behind the curtains
[33:36] and only the priests
[33:40] were allowed to go in there
[33:44] behind that curtain
[33:47] thank god he's going to have a people
[33:50] that are all kings and priests unto the
[33:53] living god
[33:55] that will be allowed to go in
[33:58] behind the veil behind the curtains to
[34:02] see
[34:03] that god whom they serve though blessed
[34:06] be his name
[34:08] and so
[34:09] the purifier
[34:11] was behind the curtain
[34:14] and it
[34:16] covered up this great mysterious light
[34:21] was was just
[34:22] covered up
[34:24] by
[34:25] simple curtains
[34:27] which as you know was not made with
[34:31] all kinds of human beauty but
[34:34] got skins and badgers skins and
[34:37] sheepskins it was just skins and had it
[34:41] there when the god of heaven could have
[34:43] had the richest the best everything else
[34:47] but he chose to use the skins of
[34:51] ordinary animals to cover his great
[34:56] eternal glory in the tabernacle
[35:00] there he was oh praise god hallelujah
[35:05] then my friends
[35:08] we understand that he was not going to
[35:12] always stay there
[35:15] because the bible tells us
[35:18] in the book in the gospel of matthew
[35:21] chapter 27
[35:23] verses 50 and 51
[35:27] speaking about the crucifixion of our
[35:29] lord
[35:31] and then
[35:32] the bible said he lifted up his voice
[35:36] and cried and he gave up the ghost
[35:40] and the scriptures
[35:42] tell
[35:42] tells us when he gave up the ghost the
[35:46] earth shook the mountains shook there
[35:49] were great earthquakes and the bible
[35:53] says the curtain of the
[35:56] tabernacle the synagogue or temple was
[36:00] shown it was torn cut from top to bottom
[36:05] oh praise god what god had pulled back
[36:09] the curtains on jesus
[36:13] his word
[36:14] oh praise god
[36:17] amen i believe we are living in this
[36:20] same season now
[36:23] the word was gone through
[36:26] another crucifixion
[36:28] and now come to a resurrection
[36:32] that word god pulled the curtains
[36:36] pulling the curtains off of his word
[36:39] hallelujah and it just happens that god
[36:43] is looking for white raw people
[36:47] oh people that will what what white raw
[36:50] people those of whom the 24 elders said
[36:54] oh praise god who are these with robes
[36:58] in white oh these are they who wash
[37:02] their robes in the blood of the lamb and
[37:06] made them white in the blood of the lamb
[37:08] oh glory to god hallelujah amen
[37:12] now my friends i could be labor or spend
[37:17] time on that quotation i use but i don't
[37:20] want to do that i my my my real object
[37:25] was to come to the place in that
[37:28] quotation
[37:29] where the lord said to brother branham
[37:34] saw the white fowls
[37:36] that were around the back bread already
[37:40] and could have just act as much as they
[37:44] wanted
[37:45] they just took a little bit and left the
[37:48] rest there
[37:50] so now here comes this great storehouse
[37:55] this mountain of bread
[37:57] that is there
[37:59] and
[38:00] god created another platform for him
[38:04] and he found a platform
[38:08] on the planes
[38:09] and there it was already built erected
[38:12] is the word he used and he said it had
[38:15] curtains but the voice said
[38:19] pulled back those curtains
[38:22] and so he the part curtains were pulled
[38:25] he pulled the curtains back hallelujah
[38:28] and and here they come those white
[38:32] robbed ones come running he says from
[38:36] everywhere
[38:37] they were running to do what to eat from
[38:40] that
[38:41] mountain of bread he said which was the
[38:45] bread of life glory to god i want to
[38:48] thank god my friends that i believe i
[38:53] caught sight of that bread of life i
[38:56] believe that i'm walking and eating and
[39:00] running towards it and eating from it
[39:03] and enjoying it and praising god for it
[39:06] but oh thank god that bread was behind
[39:10] the veil
[39:13] oh but thank god
[39:15] he pulled back the veil
[39:17] so that i could recognize
[39:20] the word the revealed word now because
[39:23] the veil is pulled back from my heart my
[39:27] eyes your heart your eyes and you could
[39:31] see
[39:32] the revelation of the word not the
[39:35] curtain
[39:36] over the word but the revelation of the
[39:40] word i want to thank god
[39:43] because jesus was trying to do it for
[39:45] the apostles
[39:47] but they never caught on
[39:50] until they got to the upper room
[39:53] what what curtains was he trying to pull
[39:55] apart jesus was trying to
[39:59] pull
[40:00] apart the curtains of prophecy
[40:03] filled with shadows types
[40:06] symbols of things that were going to be
[40:11] and so he was trying did not moses say
[40:14] this did not isaiah say that oh and he
[40:19] caught it
[40:20] from the various prophets trying to let
[40:23] them
[40:24] see what was behind the curtains of
[40:28] prophecy
[40:30] but thank god when he did that they
[40:33] could not understand what he was saying
[40:37] only bits and pieces
[40:39] and they said lord how is it we
[40:42] understand
[40:43] what some of what you're saying what
[40:45] you're saying because unto you it is
[40:48] given to know the mysteries of the
[40:51] kingdom but unto them it's not given oh
[40:55] praise god you're on the inside there on
[40:58] the outside they
[41:00] they can't see what you are seeing
[41:02] unless they were ordained to see it oh
[41:06] praise god in our day and time
[41:09] praise god i don't know who will see who
[41:12] what see who is in and who is out i
[41:15] don't know that i cannot say i cannot
[41:20] make any differentiation i am just
[41:23] saying what i am seeing or praise god
[41:27] because as the prophet said they will
[41:30] see what it is time for them to see
[41:33] maybe god allows some of us to see a
[41:36] little ahead and others will be coming
[41:38] in later i don't know but i'm here
[41:41] preaching the word of god i'm bringing
[41:45] the anointed word of life to you let us
[41:48] eat from the storehouse let us eat from
[41:51] this mountain of bread let us partake
[41:54] from this great storehouse that god has
[41:58] for us oh blessed be the name of the
[42:00] lord for the curtains are now pulled
[42:03] back
[42:05] and now
[42:06] he the word is in plain view
[42:09] oh behold the mighty conqueror he has
[42:13] rent the veil into he has pulled the
[42:16] curtains apart i've said he's pulled the
[42:20] curtains of prophecy that we can see the
[42:23] manifestation
[42:25] of prophecy taking place in our time
[42:29] until we can recognize that we are part
[42:32] of that prophecy hallelujah blessed be
[42:36] the name of the lord glory to god amen
[42:39] hallelujah amen
[42:42] yes
[42:43] god
[42:44] speaking through jesus christ
[42:47] telling them about the curtain of
[42:49] prophecy
[42:50] and there he was
[42:53] walking amongst them
[42:55] hid behind the curtain
[42:58] or the curtain
[43:01] of the skin
[43:02] of a man called jesus
[43:06] oh my glory to god and there was god
[43:10] behind that skin veil of the man called
[43:14] jesus christ but on that dark day of
[43:18] calvary
[43:20] when he gave up the ghost hallelujah
[43:23] glory to god when he gave up the ghost
[43:26] the curtain spotted and there he was the
[43:31] mighty god in christ
[43:33] god in plain view the great holy spirit
[43:38] now released to return back upon the
[43:41] disciples and let them feed from the
[43:44] bread of life which was stored up during
[43:47] his time on earth because they could
[43:50] grow back now and remember what he spoke
[43:54] with them what he tried to make known to
[43:58] them now it could make sense now it can
[44:01] make understanding now it could be
[44:04] revelation
[44:05] praise god because he had a mountain of
[44:09] bread also there waiting for them
[44:13] storing it up in his words in his
[44:15] sermons and his sayings and the things
[44:18] that he said at that day and time my
[44:22] friends think on these things
[44:25] as i speak and after i am finished
[44:28] speaking
[44:29] may the great holy spirit of almighty
[44:33] god take these words of life and
[44:37] continue to teach and to uh oh my
[44:41] friends just witness of his word to you
[44:45] not just my
[44:46] what i say but what the lord is saying
[44:50] right out of the word for yourself glory
[44:53] to god hallelujah amen so
[44:58] when he died dark day on calvary
[45:01] he gave up the ghost that was god
[45:05] parting the curtain
[45:07] to bring himself into plain view
[45:10] oh
[45:12] there i said he stands the mighty
[45:15] conqueror

[45:51] of time

[56:18] so we see
[56:21] how that in the message called the
[56:22] masterpiece the sermon
[56:25] he said often times as i referred before
[56:31] an artist would have a painting
[56:35] a glorious piece of work
[56:37] but it would be covered
[56:39] up
[56:40] and veiled
[56:42] until the time
[56:45] of display
[56:48] my my my
[56:50] oh friends i want you to know
[56:53] that he is the same god
[56:56] for in i believe it's around page seven
[56:59] or eight
[57:01] of the unveiling of the mighty god
[57:05] he said brother branham speaking
[57:07] he says now
[57:12] many of the things that i have said and
[57:14] done
[57:16] were deliberately said
[57:19] and done
[57:20] to cause some to go out
[57:25] amen and i say from this message and
[57:28] then he says
[57:30] and to cause
[57:31] others to come in
[57:34] some to wonder
[57:36] and to ponder
[57:39] and you may say
[57:41] would god do a thing like that
[57:44] yes
[57:45] he did
[57:47] and yes he still does
[57:50] yes
[57:51] and god allows them to be purposely said
[57:56] and done
[57:57] amen hallelujah
[58:00] oh
[58:00] so that
[58:02] only the elect will be able to see
[58:04] through those things
[58:06] amen then he uses the court when he says
[58:09] don't you know
[58:10] that is why jesus said hit my flesh
[58:12] drink my blood amen what was he doing he
[58:16] said he was sending out his crowd
[58:20] oh deliberately purposely sinning out
[58:23] the crowd amen yes sir oh those who
[58:28] could see oh they said lord whither
[58:31] shall we go
[58:33] thou hast the words of eternal life oh
[58:36] standing by the truth standing by the
[58:39] word no matter what because there's
[58:42] something back there even though
[58:44] intellectually they might not be able to
[58:45] explain it expound it or they might not
[58:48] be able to theologize on it analyze it
[58:51] debate it whatever but they feel enough
[58:55] the moving in their heart they have a
[58:57] witness that there is something back of
[59:00] that veil something back of those
[59:02] curtains oh glory to god hallelujah but
[59:06] when the time comes for a quick short
[59:08] work
[59:10] when the time comes for a display of the
[59:12] holy spirit and of the bride oh my then
[59:16] what happens the the curtains are pulled
[59:20] off that you can see god in his glory on
[59:23] the word praise god hallelujah time for
[59:27] display
[59:29] time for the veil to come off the
[59:31] masterpiece
[59:33] time for the veil to be lifted off of
[59:36] them oh my glory to god
[59:39] hallelujah
[59:40] veiling as a masterpiece but thank god
[59:44] the veil is ripping
[59:46] and renting hallelujah and is starting
[59:49] to reveal him and reveal his face christ
[59:54] revealed in his own word

[1:00:48] the written this
[1:00:50] words of the message is just a veil for
[1:00:53] the logos
[1:00:55] so the logos
[1:00:58] was very and has been veiled and to the
[1:01:01] eyes of many still yet veiled
[1:01:05] but thank god

[1:01:58] close to christianity amen but contrary
[1:02:03] to the word of god the holy spirit has
[1:02:06] turned on the light and the shining
[1:02:09] light of the holy spirit my friends the
[1:02:12] great death star shining on the word
[1:02:15] brings it to life amen praise god
[1:02:19] forevermore
[1:02:20] oh
[1:02:21] there's a revival going on
[1:02:24] not a revival of masses of people and
[1:02:27] numbers
[1:02:28] but i'm a part of that revival that
[1:02:31] revivals in me that revival is in many
[1:02:34] others who believes wherever they are
[1:02:37] some of them i never met i don't know
[1:02:39] but there's got to be men women people
[1:02:43] around this world that's hearing and
[1:02:47] seeing the same thing by the
[1:02:50] manifestation of the holy spirit and the
[1:02:52] supernatural power of god who made known
[1:02:56] his word to the apostles back then oh
[1:03:00] praise god holy men of god wrote the
[1:03:04] word of god as they were inspired by the
[1:03:06] holy spirit and the same holy spirit has
[1:03:10] come again to inspire to anoint and to
[1:03:13] use men and women of god for his glory
[1:03:16] and for his honor glory to god so
[1:03:20] the logos was veiled by this message
[1:03:25] and a lot of folks
[1:03:27] just felt satisfied as long as they
[1:03:29] quoted the word form as long as they
[1:03:32] quoted the word form as long as they
[1:03:34] said exactly what the prophet said word
[1:03:38] for word
[1:03:40] their feeling is they got it oh all you
[1:03:43] got my friend is i gotta hold to the
[1:03:46] curtains
[1:03:47] all you got my friend is the curtains of
[1:03:50] darkness
[1:03:52] oh
[1:03:53] but oh ask god for a rising of the sun
[1:03:57] ask god like he said to brother branham
[1:04:00] don't just stand there pull back the
[1:04:03] curtains oh he said i pulled the
[1:04:06] curtains back and the people come

[1:04:36] not adding to the word not bringing
[1:04:40] something it's new to your ears it might
[1:04:43] sound like it's you but it's the same
[1:04:45] word of god the unwritten part of the
[1:04:48] word hallelujah a veil is coming off of
[1:04:52] that blessed be the name of the lord

[1:05:35] this message
[1:05:38] is the veil
[1:05:39] and so the logos was veiled
[1:05:43] and is still veiled to some many
[1:05:46] by the
[1:05:47] message
[1:05:50] and only the great holy spirit
[1:05:53] can lift the veil
[1:05:55] from your eyes and let you see
[1:05:58] only the holy spirit

[1:06:02] oh he is going to teach you he's going
[1:06:05] to reveal to you he's going to make
[1:06:07] known himself to you by the opening of

[1:06:18] ripped that curtain from top to bottom
[1:06:20] in the holy of holies

[1:06:25] be the angel of god himself

[1:07:24] bottom and in our day rip the whole veil
[1:07:27] from genesis right through to revelation
