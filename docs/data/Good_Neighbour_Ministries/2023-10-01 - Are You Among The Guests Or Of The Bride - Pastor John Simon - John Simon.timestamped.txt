[14:28] [Music]
[14:43] BL Church um it's
[14:47] truly a blessing to stand before you all
[14:52] um many of you witnessed on uh Late July
[14:57] their Sunday service beautiful message
[15:00] was preached by brother
[15:01] Tim and uh message
[15:05] ended my memory completely blanks out um
[15:11] and lots of many many things um happened
[15:16] and it turned out that I suffered a
[15:17] stroke that
[15:19] Sunday um when I got to the
[15:23] hospital my ability to speak walk was
[15:27] diminished I uh I needed help to do
[15:31] simple things
[15:33] um but one
[15:37] thing both brother Dany and brother Tim
[15:39] who were speaking to me during that
[15:42] period they said to me don't lose
[15:45] Faith um I was backsliding for many many
[15:49] many years
[15:51] and this ministry this church is where I
[15:55] found my way back to the Lord praise the
[15:57] Lord hallelujah
[16:04] and as soon as I started coming back to
[16:07] church and giving my life back to the
[16:08] Lord the enemy started fighting me
[16:12] fighting me fighting me fighting me
[16:14] fighting me in my
[16:15] home and finally the
[16:19] stroke
[16:21] but but the Tim said Sheila have faith
[16:24] sister Sheila have faith a battle will
[16:27] come
[16:29] but the sun will break through the
[16:32] storm and I continued to hold on I was
[16:36] scared but I continued to hold on
[16:39] finally my uh ability to walk came back
[16:42] and uh I was talking normally again and
[16:45] the doctors were
[16:47] like we've never seen somebody recover
[16:50] from a stroke so
[16:54] quickly
[16:56] um and uh turns out during the stroke I
[17:00] also suffered uh
[17:03] seizure and uh two Sundays ago on the
[17:07] 17th I texted brother Danny I said I'm
[17:09] and brother Tim I said I'm going to be
[17:11] at church this I believe I was trying to
[17:13] call brother Danny that Sunday to let
[17:15] him know that I was going to be at
[17:17] church I texted brother Tim I I'm going
[17:19] to be at church I was cleared to
[17:21] drive got into the car everything was
[17:24] perfect got into the
[17:26] car the last minut memory I have was
[17:30] getting on the qw I was coming from
[17:33] Hamilton and I merged onto the
[17:37] qw and it goes
[17:40] black and the next time I came back I
[17:43] was safely parked
[17:46] remarkably on Tesla
[17:49] Drive approximately about 1 and a half
[17:53] to 2 kilm away from the highway and my
[17:57] 7-year-old son said Mommy I just
[18:00] remember we were bouncing up and down
[18:02] bouncing up and down and I thought so my
[18:06] husband
[18:08] retraced where um we
[18:10] were so the merge onto the qw my husband
[18:15] says to me if we had swerved to the left
[18:18] we would have been hit by oncoming
[18:21] traffic if we had continued going
[18:25] forward we would have hit the um
[18:28] Burlington Skyway and God knows what
[18:31] would have happened but we swerved to
[18:34] the right an exited on um a Tesla drive
[18:40] and what had happened was the wheel of
[18:43] the car the the right wheel of the car
[18:46] had turned completely and was scraping
[18:50] along the shoulder which was creating a
[18:53] resistance to slow down the
[18:57] car and it was just and that was the
[18:59] bouncing Sensation that my son whed with
[19:02] the wheel cuz my foot was still on the
[19:05] accelerator though I was seizing and my
[19:08] foot was still on the accelerator at 100
[19:11] kilomet plus an hour but that wheel
[19:14] worked as a resistance to slow the car
[19:17] down I believe the angel of the Lord
[19:20] came down and was driving the
[19:27] vehicle many people
[19:30] are big big big time prayer people but
[19:33] the only thing I know that God has given
[19:36] me is my voice so I'm going leave you

[37:49] brother Mike his family we're glad for
[37:51] have them in the house of God
[37:54] Amen now let's look to the word and look
[38:00] into I believe they have the scriptures
[38:02] in the back there
[38:06] already I have them typed here just
[38:09] getting myself
[38:13] organized okay let's all stand and read
[38:18] respects of the word of God and read
[38:21] from the
[38:23] word and Jesus answered and spake unto
[38:26] them
[38:27] Again by
[38:31] Parables and the kingdom of heaven is
[38:33] like unto a certain King which made a
[38:37] marriage for his
[38:39] son and sent his servants to call them
[38:42] that were bidden to the wedding and they
[38:45] would not come and again he sent forth
[38:48] other servants saying tell them which
[38:51] are bidden behold I have prepared my
[38:55] dinner my oxen my fatlings are killed
[38:58] and all things are ready amen all things
[39:03] are ready do you believe that come to
[39:05] the feast because all things are ready
[39:10] come unto the
[39:12] marriage but they made light of it see
[39:17] and went their ways one to his farm
[39:20] another to his
[39:22] merchandise and the remnant took his
[39:24] servants and entreated them spite F and
[39:27] slew them but when the king heard
[39:31] thereof he was wroth angry and sent
[39:34] forth his armies and destroyed those
[39:36] murderers and burnt up their
[39:39] City then said he to his servants the
[39:42] wedding is ready but they that were
[39:46] bidden were not
[39:48] worthy go ye therefore into the highways
[39:51] and as many as you shall find bid to the
[39:55] marriage so these servants went into the
[40:00] highways and gathered together all as
[40:03] many as they found both bad and good and
[40:07] the wedding was furnished with
[40:11] guests watch that now it was furnished
[40:14] with guests those people that were
[40:17] bidden were
[40:19] guests right and when the king came to
[40:23] see the guests he saw there a man which
[40:27] had not on a wedding
[40:31] garment and he said unto him friend how
[40:35] camest thou in tther not having a
[40:40] wedding garment and he was
[40:44] speechless then said the king to the
[40:47] servants bind him hand and foot take him
[40:51] away cast him into out of Darkness there
[40:55] shall be weeping and nashing of teeth
[40:59] for many are
[41:02] called but few are chosen and I am one
[41:07] of the
[41:08] few I believe I'm one of the few I hope
[41:11] you believe that too praise the name of
[41:14] the Lord hallelujah uh let us just look
[41:18] to the Lord in prayer right now father
[41:20] we thank you for the reading of the
[41:23] word and as we go into the word Lord may
[41:27] your spirit go before us preparing the
[41:29] channels the way and opening up the uh
[41:33] Pathways of inspiration and may the
[41:36] spirit of God surge forth father
[41:38] bringing to us life forever more for we
[41:41] ask it in the name of our Lord Jesus
[41:44] Christ amen and amen praise the Lord God
[41:47] bless you please be
[41:51] seated now the first thing I'm going to
[41:53] do is bring you back up to uh uh speed
[41:57] let's say it that way uh so that we can
[42:00] uh progress and move forward uh we want
[42:04] to uh talk about this because in the
[42:07] last sermon we talked together about who
[42:10] are
[42:11] called and who are chosen who are these
[42:15] called and who are The Chosen uh it is a
[42:18] great blessing because even when I went
[42:21] to the youth Fellowship a young man who
[42:24] is not a member of this church church or
[42:26] anything else he said he just went
[42:29] online and thought he'd look up what was
[42:32] being preached and he heard that and he
[42:34] had to listen it again it's been a
[42:36] blessing to his heart and cause him to
[42:40] start really thinking and praying uh
[42:44] where am I positioned there am I just uh
[42:48] uh called or or chosen right so um this
[42:53] is the problem we have in a message so
[42:56] so many people claim that they are
[42:59] following the message and that they
[43:01] believe the message and we are not
[43:05] saying that they're not uh going to be
[43:08] saved but
[43:10] positionally um in the book of life and
[43:13] in the plan of God whether to be the
[43:16] bride whether to be a guard whether to
[43:19] be a servant whether to be whatever God
[43:23] has plans in his kingdom what position
[43:28] and what place are they going to be in
[43:31] because remember I I repeat we are not
[43:34] saying because they're not in the bride
[43:36] they're not going to be
[43:38] saved because the
[43:41] guests also had wedding
[43:44] garments but in this third or this other
[43:48] section this fellow had no wedding
[43:52] garment he had a false one an
[43:54] impersonated garment garment that he
[43:57] tried to put on but these others did
[44:00] have a wedding garment given to them by
[44:03] the bright room
[44:05] himself so they they're going to be
[44:08] saved but it's the
[44:12] classification are they in the bright
[44:14] class
[44:16] no which other class will they be in as
[44:20] I mentioned before guards servants
[44:24] whatever uh their place God has his own
[44:27] portion praise the Lord
[44:30] hallelujah now we discovered from this
[44:34] Parable that the king had a wedding for
[44:37] his for his son and sent out his
[44:41] servants to invite guests to come to
[44:45] this
[44:46] wedding um and of
[44:49] course
[44:51] groomsmen guests and bridegroom all were
[44:55] formally
[44:57] invited that doesn't make them the
[45:00] bride because they have an invitation
[45:04] because they have a desire because they
[45:07] even feel the pull because they also
[45:10] have an
[45:11] invitation so they'll feel the pull
[45:14] also
[45:16] but who is he going to reveal his
[45:19] secrets
[45:21] too that person doesn't have to have an
[45:26] invitation as we go on let me I'm
[45:28] getting ahead of myself praise the Lord
[45:31] but there's only one bride never mind if
[45:33] going beat 10 billion guests and she can
[45:37] have a whole train of bridesma and uh
[45:40] Brides uh groomsmen or whatever but
[45:44] there's only one bride can you say amen
[45:48] amen only one bride that's the way it is
[45:51] with God Amen so we understand that
[45:55] being
[45:57] called just means that you've been given
[45:59] an
[46:00] [Applause]
[46:01] invitation you see John 316 tells us
[46:05] whosoever will may come whosoever will
[46:10] may come but coming running to the altar
[46:15] going to a church it doesn't mean that
[46:18] you are in a
[46:19] bride you just felt and heard the call
[46:25] you see and this is where the prophets
[46:28] separated uh all these churches think
[46:31] because they have thousands millions of
[46:34] members running to the altar making
[46:37] confessions making sacrifices
[46:39] flagellations and uh different ways uh
[46:43] passing the flag over their head
[46:45] baptizing three times backwards three
[46:48] times forwards shaking the the Pope's
[46:51] hand or or the super superintendent's
[46:53] hand they all have their various means
[46:57] of how they tell you you're qualified to
[47:00] be saved and God's word said it plain to
[47:03] us how you must be born
[47:08] again and that is not by manmade
[47:11] standards efforts or guidelines that
[47:14] they give you not all the Bible
[47:17] teachings in the world can get your
[47:19] saved not all the theological addresses
[47:22] in the world can get you saved none of
[47:26] those things will save you right see now
[47:29] back here you should be understand that
[47:33] um is to receive the message is just to
[47:38] receive the
[47:40] invitation to receive the message is to
[47:43] receive the
[47:45] invitation the servant of God went out
[47:48] with a shout and declared to you to come
[47:51] in called out and brought in the
[47:55] multitude tudes good bad ugly whatever
[47:59] he didn't care what it was he threw out
[48:02] the net in the sea and and and just
[48:05] pulled in as many as he could because
[48:08] it's the invitation bringing you in
[48:12] Praise the Lord but he can't make you
[48:16] the
[48:17] bride Hallelujah he can't do it the
[48:21] bride was already bride from before the
[48:24] foundation of the world am so there's
[48:27] nothing that he could do now except to
[48:30] invite and call and when he call is a
[48:33] big crowd big congregation worldwide he
[48:37] doesn't even know some of them but one
[48:41] maybe bride one may not be bride one may
[48:44] be this one may be that but his business
[48:46] was to
[48:48] call back to the word back to the
[48:51] original Faith hallu back to what God
[48:54] gave in the world word hallelujah amen
[48:58] that's what he was doing praise the Lord
[49:00] amen
[49:02] so having the invitation coming to the
[49:06] message is just to receive the
[49:10] invitation and all you have there is an
[49:13] invitation to this wonderful message but
[49:16] it doesn't mean that you're one of the
[49:19] elect praise the
[49:22] Lord it just means that you were caught
[49:25] in the prophetic message
[49:28] net right and he made that plain several
[49:32] scriptures tells you there will be a
[49:34] time where you separate sheep from goost
[49:36] a time when he will send his servants
[49:37] and he will separate the chaff from the
[49:40] you know different ways that he has put
[49:42] it over there'll be a time when there
[49:45] will be
[49:46] separation God's word calls for what
[49:50] separation from unbelief not only in
[49:53] your head and your heart but un
[49:56] belief right in all its aspects even
[49:59] when it's personified God's word calls
[50:02] for separation from
[50:05] unbelief praise the Lord hallelujah so
[50:10] we understand that the Holy Spirit Jesus
[50:13] Christ in the form of the Holy Spirit
[50:16] using Brother Bren cast his net into the
[50:20] sea of
[50:21] humanity and brought in all that the net
[50:25] could catch and brought them all to sh
[50:29] believing praise the Lord but I believe
[50:33] that now is the
[50:35] time praise God this time has recycled
[50:39] from through each Church age each
[50:42] messenger had this time at the end of
[50:44] his message when God would do a
[50:46] separation right praise God but I'm
[50:49] talking at our time our day now how God
[50:52] is separating the rainbow tra out from
[50:57] the rest of uh creatures that were in
[51:01] the
[51:02] net all were in the net all were in the
[51:05] church all were in the message all was
[51:06] believing the prophet all was shouting
[51:09] all was praising God but he alone knew
[51:12] what he
[51:14] wanted he didn't come to have
[51:17] crabs he didn't feel like eating crabs
[51:20] he didn't come to eat crawfish he didn't
[51:22] come to eat Bottom Feeders he he didn't
[51:25] come for shrimp or anything else he
[51:28] wanted rainbow
[51:31] trout there were marked from since the
[51:34] day they were born the seven color
[51:37] rainbow color was striped right across
[51:40] their souls and he knew what he wanted
[51:44] and so he come to separate them from the
[51:47] rest that were there oh praise God
[51:50] forever more hallelujah amen so
[51:54] separating what the
[51:56] bride from the in those that were
[52:00] invited or from the guests praise God so
[52:04] today I really want to talk about are
[52:06] you a
[52:09] guest are you among the
[52:11] guests or are you of the
[52:15] Bride praise
[52:18] God now we know with the opening of The
[52:21] Seven
[52:23] Seals that the prophet plainly said
[52:27] it he came
[52:30] down uh when the Seven Angels Came to
[52:33] him he came down because he identified
[52:38] the angel in the front with the
[52:40] sweptback wings that was leading the
[52:42] rest of them he
[52:45] said that was not a man of Earth he's
[52:48] telling you that those angels
[52:50] represented The Messengers that was
[52:52] there before but now here is the mighty
[52:55] the angel
[52:56] himself coming on the scene amen and
[53:00] when he's coming on the scene now he
[53:02] says not he is not a man of Earth this
[53:06] is the Lord From Heaven glory to God
[53:09] what is it the opening of the seventh
[53:12] seal was the mystery coming of Jesus
[53:15] Christ who promised he would come in
[53:19] these last days as a thief in the night
[53:23] a thief comes very quietly he doesn't
[53:26] call attention to himself he doesn't
[53:28] keep a whole lot of noise to let people
[53:31] recognize what important thing is going
[53:34] on he just steals in and he steals out
[53:38] and that's what God is doing now byass
[53:41] like he did when Jesus was born he
[53:43] bypassed all the big synagogues all the
[53:46] big high priests all ananas cahas Herod
[53:50] all of he bypassed
[53:53] everyone and went out in the fields to
[53:57] simple
[53:59] Shepherds and revealed that he was born
[54:02] in the city of
[54:03] David see but why didn't he come to
[54:07] cifas these men are men of note at least
[54:10] they have doctors of divinity they have
[54:12] llds phds and what not every else but
[54:15] that's God's choosing amen is that right
[54:19] he chose the lowly the simple the humble
[54:24] and just when you are thinking no that
[54:27] guy can't be the Messiah he I know I
[54:31] know his mother he was born over here I
[54:35] saw when he used to play with the kids
[54:37] but that's how God hides what he's doing
[54:40] in Simplicity amen because man always
[54:44] tends to look for something high and
[54:46] lofty and they're looking at the stars
[54:49] and they can't even see the the the the
[54:52] genius the blessing of God God in the
[54:55] grass they can't even create a blade but
[54:58] they're talking about going to the stars
[55:01] and we know the scriptures really
[55:03] already said it though you rise to the
[55:05] Stars I will bring you down God already
[55:09] know they can go there so he already
[55:10] said it by the prophets in the word
[55:12] though you try to go up to the Stars I'm
[55:15] going to bring you down right so here we
[55:18] go praise the Lord so we know that
[55:21] separation is taken separation and
[55:24] identification
[55:25] is taking place by
[55:28] Revelation he's identifying his own
[55:32] because only they have been given the
[55:36] capacity the capacitor the whatever you
[55:38] want to call it to be able to pick up
[55:42] the Revelation coming out of the word
[55:46] which is not just the written
[55:49] bible just like when a man speaks it's
[55:52] not just the the word that you can type
[55:54] on on a piece of paper but the nuances
[55:57] and the undertones the what goes along
[56:01] with that right so so God now has really
[56:07] put his secret not just in the written
[56:11] word but in the unwritten word when you
[56:15] say Unwritten word a lot of people
[56:16] thinks mean you're going to add
[56:17] something to no you're not adding
[56:20] anything it's the same word but this one
[56:23] is the spirit of of the word that
[56:26] couldn't be written down see could not
[56:29] be written down you can't write down the
[56:31] spirit of the word the spirit of the
[56:34] message the spirit of how the person
[56:36] said it that that that person has to
[56:38] come back and tell you how they said it
[56:41] is that right why why why but if I wrote
[56:47] the word why you wouldn't know how they
[56:48] said it so God is his own interpreter am
[56:53] and he will make it thank you Jesus so
[56:56] he's come back under that seventh seal
[57:00] and he is now making himself by his word
[57:05] to his bride it's going to be preached
[57:08] everybody's going to hear it but uh some
[57:12] will hear it but only naturally because
[57:15] they have ears others will hear it in
[57:19] their heart because they were
[57:21] predestinated and chosen of God to hear
[57:23] it in their day and in their time praise
[57:27] the Lord I always stop and pause for a
[57:31] minute to ask you does this make sense
[57:33] to
[57:34] you praise the name of the Lord
[57:37] hallelujah yes sir the Deep calls to the
[57:42] deep and then when the Deep calls to the
[57:46] Deep the Deep responds in every love
[57:49] story that is what it is it's the Deep
[57:52] calling to the Deep um
[57:55] I first met my wife she's sitting right
[57:57] there she doesn't like this because she
[57:59] doesn't like to call attention but um
[58:03] here I am preaching um and I'm preaching
[58:07] the word we were in fasting and prayer
[58:09] all day two o'l now we take a break just
[58:13] to drink a bit of water and go back get
[58:17] some Breeze go back in and start praying
[58:19] again there a bunch of ministers so I go
[58:23] out on the balcony of the
[58:25] house and and there you know just taking
[58:27] it and there's this beauty coming down
[58:34] street and seven Thunders
[58:38] blasted Bam Bam Bam Bam
[58:41] Bam my good Lord have
[58:47] mercy and so I had I had to approach her
[58:50] I just couldn't look at her from afar
[58:53] right go back in and try to pray you
[58:55] can't
[58:59] concentrate anyway that's not what I'm
[59:01] preaching about let me come off of
[59:03] that and get back to what um I'm
[59:07] supposed to be talking about here praise
[59:09] the Lord so we understand
[59:13] Supernatural uh uh
[59:16] identification of the Bride by her
[59:19] capacity to receive Revelation is going
[59:23] on now yes is that right many are called
[59:29] but few are
[59:32] chosen yes that is true praise the Lord
[59:36] so the prophet used the Gathering by the
[59:41] supernatural attraction of the word of
[59:44] God and that super natural attraction
[59:49] just pray for me here I don't want to
[59:51] speak in tongues because that's not what
[59:54] we here for be here to receive the word
[59:57] praise the Lord but um we see
[1:00:01] then that before you can have a wedding
[1:00:05] before you can even have an invitation
[1:00:07] to a
[1:00:08] wedding the bridegroom already would
[1:00:11] have to have his bride and know who is
[1:00:12] his bride or there going to be no
[1:00:15] wedding invitation going
[1:00:17] out you you understand what praise the
[1:00:20] Lord so so what we are saying and what
[1:00:23] you ought to say see from the word god
[1:00:26] already had his bride in his mind from
[1:00:31] before the foundations of the
[1:00:34] [Applause]
[1:00:37] world before she was manifested on the
[1:00:40] earth and born of a ordinary mother and
[1:00:43] father and come here to live in human
[1:00:46] bodies God knew you and I if we are part
[1:00:51] of him he already knew who we were
[1:00:55] amen and that is why Satan cannot
[1:01:00] impersonate the third
[1:01:02] pool because only those ones that were
[1:01:06] in his mind that were a a part of his
[1:01:10] bride can really received his Unwritten
[1:01:15] word his revelation of this Bible that
[1:01:18] we all read only they can receive it
[1:01:21] blessed are your ears that you hear
[1:01:24] blessed are your eyes praise God that
[1:01:27] you can see here oh For unto you it is
[1:01:34] given given to what to know the
[1:01:37] mysteries of the kingdom of God it's a
[1:01:41] mystery to them but a revelation to you
[1:01:44] is that right praise the Lord hallelujah
[1:01:47] amen so we were chosen from before the
[1:01:50] foundation his bride was chosen before
[1:01:52] the foundation let that be a settled
[1:01:54] fact in your
[1:01:55] mind chosen to be the apple of his eyes
[1:01:59] praise the Lord according to Songs of
[1:02:01] Solomon praise God and so the wedding is
[1:02:05] going on here now on Earth praise God
[1:02:10] you can read a book proving his word
[1:02:12] where brother brandham says that yes but
[1:02:15] the wedding is going on here now on
[1:02:17] Earth when the word of God marries your
[1:02:22] soul is that right
[1:02:24] praise the Lord but human beings they're
[1:02:27] thinking of a marriage with a lot of
[1:02:29] people gathered around and and eating
[1:02:32] ham and eating chicken and turkey and
[1:02:36] wedding cakes and they don't understand
[1:02:38] this is we talking about a spiritual
[1:02:40] thing going on you don't you don't see
[1:02:44] that uh like that but it's in your heart
[1:02:48] the word and your heart matches and when
[1:02:52] you hear the word the the the real word
[1:02:55] if I put it that way when you hear the
[1:02:57] real word preached and the Holy Spirit
[1:03:00] start taking it and speaking to your
[1:03:02] soul it's just like you like you knew it
[1:03:06] before it's like you're are you you
[1:03:09] you're reuniting with what you're
[1:03:11] supposed to be and know and it fits you
[1:03:14] like a hand in a glove you can't get
[1:03:17] away from it you turn to the right you
[1:03:19] turn to the left you look up you look
[1:03:21] down you can't see anything else because
[1:03:23] it fits your
[1:03:25] soul amen praise God forever more glory
[1:03:29] to God I I think I mentioned to you
[1:03:31] years ago the scientists were doing h a
[1:03:34] an
[1:03:35] experiment they took a female moth to
[1:03:38] New York City and had her there and the
[1:03:42] male lab was over here in Canada they
[1:03:45] loosed
[1:03:46] him and in about 6 months time Bang Bang
[1:03:50] Bang on the window it was the male Marth
[1:03:54] which they caught and proved he was the
[1:03:56] male M because he was tagged that they
[1:03:59] could he
[1:04:01] somehow he came found a way all those
[1:04:06] miles right to where she was and that's
[1:04:09] what's happened with us we came from his
[1:04:13] side we got caught in sin we come down
[1:04:15] here and he here he comes down from his
[1:04:19] glory ever living story my God and
[1:04:23] savior came and Jesus was his name oh
[1:04:27] praise God and he came to us to find us
[1:04:30] and to bring us back to where we were we
[1:04:33] were lost but now we're found we were
[1:04:35] blind but now we see we recognize who we
[1:04:39] are because we are one of his own praise
[1:04:42] be to God
[1:04:46] hallelujah
[1:04:47] so he's coming now to take us to his
[1:04:50] father's
[1:04:51] house the wedding is over
[1:04:54] and The Chariot ride is what takes place
[1:04:58] now and we go with him to the father's
[1:05:02] house praise the Lord so we understand
[1:05:06] therefore that the bride's
[1:05:10] name was and is already recorded in the
[1:05:16] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:05:18] foundation of the
[1:05:20] world uh you take all those scriptures I
[1:05:23] don't want to think about that but your
[1:05:24] mind could go in that area where he says
[1:05:27] there's none really going to be saved
[1:05:30] talking saved except that their names
[1:05:33] are in the Lamb's Book of Life praise
[1:05:37] the Lord that would be another
[1:05:39] discussion and preaching that doesn't
[1:05:41] just mean the bride but like I tell you
[1:05:43] the guests even had wedding wedding
[1:05:46] garments praise the Lord but the fact is
[1:05:49] her name was already
[1:05:51] recorded so uh there we understand
[1:05:55] therefore the eternal
[1:05:57] security we see the teaching of
[1:06:01] predestination and for knowledge the god
[1:06:04] whom we serve capable of knowing
[1:06:08] predestinated me doesn't mean that he
[1:06:10] push you into something which means he
[1:06:12] knows he forew and because he forew he
[1:06:17] could create the circumstances to bring
[1:06:20] you to
[1:06:21] himself praise the name of the Lord
[1:06:24] Hallelujah
[1:06:25] so we are registered we are we the
[1:06:29] marriage and our names as bride is
[1:06:32] already on the marriage license amen
[1:06:36] it's
[1:06:37] registered it's
[1:06:39] recorded it's in heaven it's in the
[1:06:42] Lamb's Book of Life praise be to God
[1:06:46] Amen I can stand here today and say I am
[1:06:50] bride I am part of that bride praise the
[1:06:54] Lord I believe it with all my heart can
[1:06:57] you say it let's say it together I am
[1:07:00] part of the Bride let's repeat it again
[1:07:04] I am part of the Bride I'm recorded in
[1:07:07] the book
[1:07:09] Hallelujah
[1:07:15] Hall that's what the Seven Seals was
[1:07:19] about the first six seals the Holy
[1:07:23] Spirit used the prophet to show you the
[1:07:27] path of life to show you how the word or
[1:07:31] the light came down through all those
[1:07:33] ages to our time and it also showed to
[1:07:38] us that tracing the serpent seed right
[1:07:43] from the beginning right to now it also
[1:07:46] traced for us the uh mystery of
[1:07:52] iniquity from before for the Foundations
[1:07:55] at the foundations after the foundations
[1:07:58] he trace it right going right back to
[1:08:00] the pits of hell and so that we might
[1:08:03] know what was what is and what is going
[1:08:07] to be right we are part of him so that's
[1:08:10] why he has to make us know that praise
[1:08:13] God hallelujah so our name is recorded
[1:08:18] and we have uh here now we thank God
[1:08:21] that we can put the license on the
[1:08:23] display praise the lord we can put that
[1:08:26] license on display praise God and she
[1:08:30] can start we can start saying I am bride
[1:08:34] praise the Lord amen why you have faith
[1:08:37] confidence in your
[1:08:39] bridegroom we are not going to be a
[1:08:41] bride left waiting at the
[1:08:45] altar no it sounds funny but no he's
[1:08:48] made a
[1:08:50] promise I go to prepare a place for you
[1:08:53] that where I am you may be also praise
[1:08:57] the Lord and we are trusting in his
[1:08:59] promise the prophet said we are resting
[1:09:02] on that we're believing the word of God
[1:09:05] hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah
[1:09:09] yes sir praise God and she can say that
[1:09:13] because she knows her name is already
[1:09:18] recorded on that license praise the Lord
[1:09:22] and that's a blessing to know that that
[1:09:24] praise God so many are called to come
[1:09:28] and believe the
[1:09:32] message but they are not
[1:09:35] chosen to be a part of the supernatural
[1:09:40] body of the Lord Jesus Christ for this
[1:09:44] day I'm talking about he was the son of
[1:09:47] man she is the son of man for
[1:09:52] today back there he he was in the form
[1:09:54] of Jesus Christ but that God has come
[1:09:58] back now in a bride form in the form of
[1:10:04] a
[1:10:05] bride as he displayed on the day of
[1:10:08] Pentecost when the pillar fire broke up
[1:10:10] and there were small tongues of fire
[1:10:12] showing that he broke himself up to go
[1:10:14] into his Believers you see that's why
[1:10:18] the Bible says to us in him was the
[1:10:20] fullness of the godhead
[1:10:25] bodily God was in Christ now Christ is
[1:10:29] in Us in that day you'll know I am in
[1:10:32] the father you in me and I in you praise
[1:10:36] God hallelujah that's this day glory be
[1:10:39] to his wonderful name praise God yes so
[1:10:44] uh chosen to be a part of that
[1:10:46] Supernatural body and that's the
[1:10:49] difference between calling and election
[1:10:53] is that clear the difference between
[1:10:57] calling and election anybody can be
[1:11:01] called but only few are
[1:11:05] elected and as the song said I am one of
[1:11:08] the
[1:11:09] few amen one of the few praise God so
[1:11:14] the elected of course are the ones whose
[1:11:16] names are recorded in the Lamb's Book of
[1:11:18] Life some other names the Bible the
[1:11:22] prophet tells us and the Bible tells us
[1:11:24] we be blotted out or just use the word
[1:11:27] you
[1:11:29] erased names are going to be
[1:11:31] erased um out amen from The Book of Life
[1:11:36] in other words they will be as if they
[1:11:38] never even
[1:11:39] existed they they never they're so evil
[1:11:42] that God got to get rid of them
[1:11:44] completely and um there's not going to
[1:11:47] be any memory no record no history that
[1:11:49] they even existed they'll be blotted out
[1:11:53] and he raise forever amen praise God I
[1:11:57] am going to now move on from last week
[1:12:02] and let's go a little further is that
[1:12:05] okay uh we're going to go to the church
[1:12:08] age page
[1:12:12] 268 and I'm going to ask those uh
[1:12:15] Brothers to put that back up put that up
[1:12:19] glory to God be a little patient with me
[1:12:23] here today today uh I don't even think
[1:12:25] I'll be able to finish but I use
[1:12:28] discretion with times and all like that
[1:12:31] because I want you to receive the truth
[1:12:33] uh and I want you to receive it uh not
[1:12:36] because um I am saying it I want you to
[1:12:38] be able to think on these things right
[1:12:42] uh and receive it within your heart
[1:12:46] hallelujah
[1:12:48] amen I want to start from here by
[1:12:52] saying you will note here Judas was one
[1:12:58] of those who were casting out
[1:13:02] Devils
[1:13:04] amen but we know he was a
[1:13:10] devil is that
[1:13:12] right oh this is really interesting Oh
[1:13:16] my he was a devil he was the son of the
[1:13:21] devil the son of of ption that's what it
[1:13:25] means he was a son of Satan all right he
[1:13:29] was a son of the devil praise the Lord
[1:13:33] so but we find out
[1:13:36] amen that judas's name is in uh let me
[1:13:43] stop here just a minute The Book of Life
[1:13:46] Book of natural
[1:13:48] life right God has a record of everybody
[1:13:51] born whether they be good bad or ugly uh
[1:13:54] whatever whoever you are even those ones
[1:13:57] that were unborn and we don't know their
[1:14:00] name but the parent already had a name
[1:14:02] in their mind they were going to name
[1:14:04] God knows all about that you believe
[1:14:06] that amen because he told Jeremiah said
[1:14:09] I know you before you you were even in
[1:14:11] your mother's womb I knew you right so
[1:14:13] God knows all that right so here we go
[1:14:17] we so we see then friends that um with
[1:14:22] this book Book of Life That's natural we
[1:14:25] come back now to the Bible the Bible is
[1:14:28] also a part of the book of life right
[1:14:32] Book of Life the Bible itself you can
[1:14:35] even say is The Book of Life uh in a
[1:14:39] sense that our spirit not our body now
[1:14:43] our spirit has has is recorded in that
[1:14:48] word somewhere whether it's it's
[1:14:51] recorded as a bad Spirit a fox spirit a
[1:14:53] snake Spirit a lying Spirit a spider
[1:14:56] it's recorded there in symbol form
[1:15:00] within your word of God and that's your
[1:15:03] spirit but then we find out we come
[1:15:05] right back to the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:08] where your soul if you're a Believer and
[1:15:12] you are part of the elected bride she is
[1:15:15] recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:15:19] right the
[1:15:21] 144,000 other groups recorded in the
[1:15:24] Lamb's Book of Life praise God
[1:15:29] hallelujah now
[1:15:33] listen John 17:12 while I was with them
[1:15:37] in the world I kept them in thy name
[1:15:41] those that thou gavest me I have kept
[1:15:46] and none of them is lost but the son of
[1:15:50] predition Amen praise the Lord
[1:15:53] that the scripture might be
[1:15:56] fulfilled praise God he's talking that
[1:15:58] Judas was given to
[1:16:00] him but he was lost but all the other
[1:16:04] ones were not lost they were chosen he
[1:16:08] was telling you judas's purpose that he
[1:16:12] was here Among Us that the scripture
[1:16:15] might be
[1:16:16] fulfilled so so it's like saying for God
[1:16:20] to be a Healer there had to be a devil
[1:16:24] to create sicknesses and disease and
[1:16:26] trouble and trial for him to be a
[1:16:29] deliverer for him to show forth his
[1:16:31] power and his grace so he allowed it
[1:16:35] amen he allowed it that he could display
[1:16:38] his attributes that we could get to know
[1:16:42] him his nature his personality and his
[1:16:46] way of doing things praise the Lord
[1:16:49] hallelujah yes sir
[1:16:52] continuing
[1:16:53] John 13:10 11 to 11 and 18 Jesus said to
[1:16:58] him he that is washed need it not safe
[1:17:02] to wash his feet but is clean every wit
[1:17:06] and you are clean but not all for he
[1:17:10] knew who would betray
[1:17:13] him therefore said he you are not all
[1:17:17] clean I speak not not of you all I know
[1:17:23] whom I have
[1:17:25] chosen look it's right there in
[1:17:28] scripture he says I know whom I have
[1:17:31] chosen amen praise the Lord you don't go
[1:17:34] and and beat on an altar and say Lord
[1:17:37] choose me Lord Lord I know you chose her
[1:17:40] already to be the bride but you have a
[1:17:42] chance to change her and put me in her
[1:17:45] place and and take off her name from the
[1:17:47] license and put my no that doesn't
[1:17:50] happen with God we have a God that
[1:17:52] changes not we got a God that doesn't
[1:17:55] change his word stands forever it holds
[1:17:58] forever more our security is
[1:18:02] eternal praise God we are anchored in
[1:18:05] Him Praise the Lord and kept by the
[1:18:08] power of God glory to his wonderful name
[1:18:11] amen yes sir I know whom I have chosen
[1:18:14] but that the scripture might be
[1:18:18] fulfilled
[1:18:21] amen he that e had bread with
[1:18:25] me had lifted up his heel against
[1:18:30] me brother BR speaking now if language
[1:18:34] means anything at all we must admit that
[1:18:38] Judas was chosen by
[1:18:41] Jesus wow now we we dealt with the
[1:18:45] calling and the choosing now we got even
[1:18:47] in the
[1:18:49] chosen there's something there that that
[1:18:52] even Judas was was chosen mhm by Jesus
[1:18:56] John 13:18 yet he was not
[1:19:00] clean Judas was also given to
[1:19:04] Jesus by the
[1:19:07] father Hallelujah
[1:19:10] my now John 17:12 Let It Be noted here
[1:19:15] that the choosing and the giving is the
[1:19:18] exact parallel as in the illustration of
[1:19:22] of Moses and
[1:19:24] Pharaoh Jacob and Esau for True Esau and
[1:19:29] Jacob were both though they were both
[1:19:34] forn they were predestinated to
[1:19:37] wrath praise God one chosen for
[1:19:42] glorification and a Rapture and the
[1:19:45] other chosen for wrath deliberately left
[1:19:50] there left among among the
[1:19:54] disciples left among let's use the word
[1:19:57] the
[1:19:57] Believers but with the purpose of
[1:20:01] Wrath oh my glory to God
[1:20:06] hallelujah so we find that God didn't
[1:20:09] think about
[1:20:11] Judas he did think about him he knew him
[1:20:16] and he understood what was going to
[1:20:18] happen but they were predestinated to to
[1:20:22] Wrath
[1:20:23] uh they were called of God too you know
[1:20:26] how many of you know that they were
[1:20:28] called too everybody actually was called
[1:20:32] but then the bride had a deeper call
[1:20:35] that brought her out praise God glory to
[1:20:38] God hallelujah so though Esau and
[1:20:43] Pharaoh were both forn they were
[1:20:45] predestinated to the WTH while the end
[1:20:48] of Moses and Jacob was glorification
[1:20:53] praise the Lord amen isn't that
[1:20:55] wonderful to know that friends that God
[1:20:58] shows us for the Rapture or for
[1:21:03] glorification and that's where we see
[1:21:05] the richness of God's
[1:21:07] grace because uh like people think they
[1:21:11] have a lot to do with their salvation
[1:21:13] how much they pray how much they fast
[1:21:15] and that's why she got saved or he got
[1:21:17] saved because they really fasted they
[1:21:19] really prayed they did this they did
[1:21:21] that no salvation took place from before
[1:21:24] the foundation of the world you are just
[1:21:27] now manifested that you are one of the
[1:21:29] few you are manifesting what was
[1:21:33] happened back there just like how uh the
[1:21:36] lamb was what slain before the
[1:21:38] foundation of the world but God had to
[1:21:41] let it be displayed on the earth so then
[1:21:44] it had to come to Earth and he had to
[1:21:46] physically come here die so that you uh
[1:21:48] human beings with five senses can see it
[1:21:51] and identify and understand understand
[1:21:53] what really took place so our names
[1:21:56] already was recorded Hallelujah but we
[1:21:58] got to display that our names were
[1:22:01] already recorded by manifesting who we
[1:22:04] were up there down here by the Life of
[1:22:08] Christ flowing out of us the the the
[1:22:10] very virtues the very power and the
[1:22:13] presence of the Living God making itself
[1:22:16] manifest in the prepared vessels
[1:22:19] prepared for this hour to receive the
[1:22:22] word and displ his Divine person amen
[1:22:25] praise the name of the Lord Jesus amen
[1:22:28] wonderful praise God look I'm going to
[1:22:30] just jump over a lot of things here
[1:22:33] praise God quoting from uh that again he
[1:22:37] says Judas was numbered with the 12 and
[1:22:41] actually had a part with them in the
[1:22:43] ministry previous to
[1:22:45] Pentecost you know that Judas was a
[1:22:49] minister no it's right there it says he
[1:22:52] had a part of the
[1:22:54] ministry right and uh uh previous to
[1:22:58] Pentecost acts 1:16 to 17 says men and
[1:23:02] Brethren this scripture must needs have
[1:23:05] been fulfilled which the Holy Ghost by
[1:23:08] the mouth of David spake before
[1:23:13] concerning Judas amen praise the Lord
[1:23:17] who spoke of
[1:23:18] Judas the Holy Ghost by the mouth of
[1:23:22] David wasn't David but the Holy Ghost by
[1:23:26] the mouth of David spoke of
[1:23:31] Judas and if the Holy Ghost spoke of
[1:23:37] Judas that is why his name is in the
[1:23:41] written word his name is in written word
[1:23:45] the name of a lot of other characters of
[1:23:48] various means are in the word because
[1:23:50] God allow it to be there to fulfill his
[1:23:54] Divine Purpose and to bring glory to his
[1:23:58] name amen praise the Lord continuing now
[1:24:03] he obtained a part of this ministry the
[1:24:05] part that Judas obtained amongst the 12
[1:24:08] and then lost
[1:24:10] it was neither
[1:24:13] inferior to the ministries of the other
[1:24:16] 11 neither was it of devilish foreign uh
[1:24:22] Ministry interjected amongst them but
[1:24:27] acts 1:25 that he may take part of this
[1:24:31] ministry he was even an
[1:24:33] apostle it's right there you see as your
[1:24:37] understanding opens you begin to see
[1:24:40] what God in his great wisdom and might
[1:24:42] can do he was an apostle uh take part of
[1:24:47] this ministry and
[1:24:50] apostleship from which Judah Us by
[1:24:53] transgression
[1:24:55] fell that he might go to his own place
[1:25:00] he's going to his own place there not
[1:25:03] place where the scripture says for there
[1:25:05] was no place found for
[1:25:07] him there was no he had no place that he
[1:25:10] could find right so he got to go to his
[1:25:13] own place like brother bran speaking on
[1:25:16] the uh about the that day on Calvary
[1:25:19] when he talks about when the thieves
[1:25:21] were there there and and Jesus was on
[1:25:24] the cross and the one said Lord Remember
[1:25:27] Me Right praise the Lord Jesus said
[1:25:30] today you'll be with me in Paradise
[1:25:33] right see that man's one there he says
[1:25:36] but the other one says oh if you call
[1:25:38] yourself Christ come off the cross the
[1:25:40] prophet said and he went to his
[1:25:44] inheritance he went where he came from
[1:25:48] see it displays the chosen it displays
[1:25:51] the seed of God right there and makes
[1:25:54] the
[1:25:54] separation Judas that devil lost that
[1:25:58] God Holy Ghost Ministry and killed
[1:26:01] himself committed
[1:26:03] suicide which is a shameful act and went
[1:26:06] to his own place his name was even left
[1:26:12] uh even in the book of
[1:26:14] life
[1:26:17] amen but later his
[1:26:20] name blotted out
[1:26:22] praise the Lord it doesn't mean that
[1:26:25] it's BL out by burning the Bible but the
[1:26:28] record God has of him would be blotted
[1:26:32] out in other words it'll be like if you
[1:26:35] never
[1:26:36] existed it's just like you or I do you
[1:26:38] know if they took away your
[1:26:40] passports and burnt it no government has
[1:26:44] no if if all the information about you
[1:26:47] get burnt up nobody has any record of
[1:26:51] that you you existed you somebody says
[1:26:54] oh uh John Simon who is he what country
[1:26:58] is from there's no record of any country
[1:27:00] that he's in so it's put it in a simple
[1:27:03] way the fact is he will be totally
[1:27:08] erased and he is just an example of many
[1:27:12] others recorded in the Bible like the
[1:27:16] Pharaoh like
[1:27:18] Esau uh I don't know it says that about
[1:27:21] Kain but I mean characters like that
[1:27:24] that the Bible talks about their names
[1:27:26] being erased and completely block
[1:27:29] blotted out no record of them as if they
[1:27:33] were never there and like if they never
[1:27:35] even
[1:27:36] existed they never even left like even
[1:27:39] the most wicked guys would go and do
[1:27:43] some
[1:27:44] graffiti or they would put their hand or
[1:27:47] their feet in some freshly made concrete
[1:27:50] of somebody that worked so hard
[1:27:52] but you see it's the human thing that
[1:27:55] they they feel uh displaced if you can't
[1:27:58] leave a record that I was here I existed
[1:28:02] I I made a mark somewhere but God erased
[1:28:05] all the marks amen God erased everything
[1:28:09] there's nothing there for you because of
[1:28:12] what you did and the life that you live
[1:28:16] and who you manifest you didn't manifest
[1:28:19] him you manifested uh where you came
[1:28:22] from praise the lord we we're showing
[1:28:24] the difference between calling and
[1:28:27] election between being a guest and being
[1:28:30] part of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:28:34] praise God hallelujah now the Bible
[1:28:37] talks about a seven Church ages but when
[1:28:40] those Church ages are over um you know
[1:28:44] the quote from the stature of a perfect
[1:28:46] man where brother brandham himself and
[1:28:48] that's the thing that caught me that
[1:28:50] broke me into the fullness of the
[1:28:53] revelation of the word reading the
[1:28:55] statue of a perfect man when brother
[1:28:57] Bram talks about the the church Ages
[1:29:00] come to an end and after they are over I
[1:29:03] am waiting and looking for that man that
[1:29:07] woman that will come he's saying that
[1:29:11] way back when he was alive that will
[1:29:14] come at the ending of these
[1:29:19] seals going to the eternal Church age
[1:29:23] that will be at the end of the seals
[1:29:25] praise the Lord hallelujah brother if
[1:29:28] you could find that would be very nice
[1:29:30] um but you don't have to if it it's
[1:29:33] going to be difficult for you to find
[1:29:34] that quotation amen praise the Lord so
[1:29:38] the Bible is written but in the Bible is
[1:29:40] a lot of
[1:29:42] mystery and and that mystery revealed to
[1:29:46] the bride is the unwritten word making
[1:29:48] itself known to her right that is is the
[1:29:52] that is his letter to his
[1:29:55] bride uh that when she read it she knows
[1:29:58] exactly what he's thinking you know she
[1:30:01] knows what is in his mind she knows
[1:30:05] because uh they are uh they are um
[1:30:09] husband and wife praise the Lord amen
[1:30:13] praise the Lord so the father has got to
[1:30:16] reveal the word to you and when he
[1:30:18] reveals the word to you it identifies
[1:30:20] you pra praise the Lord he said but me I
[1:30:23] am not uh I don't understand anything
[1:30:27] you got to understand something do you
[1:30:29] know that Judas was one of the
[1:30:32] brightest of the
[1:30:35] disciples he was
[1:30:37] sharp he was
[1:30:39] bright but he was not
[1:30:43] chosen he was he was figures numbers my
[1:30:48] goodness he was just wonderful marvelous
[1:30:52] that you talk about education Judas had
[1:30:55] it and he was there amongst them praise
[1:30:59] the Lord and so we living in a day now
[1:31:04] and I mention that because everybody now
[1:31:06] now the devil always does that he
[1:31:09] follows the pattern he's a
[1:31:11] copycat see when you are only preaching
[1:31:15] about Pentecost everybody start talking
[1:31:17] about
[1:31:18] Pentecost all of a sudden it's not just
[1:31:21] Pentecost you need to be born again
[1:31:24] everybody start talking about being born
[1:31:28] again Jim Baker this one that one
[1:31:30] doesn't matter how much mascara they
[1:31:32] have on and start to cry and it all
[1:31:37] start to run down their face and they
[1:31:40] say oh thank God I'm born
[1:31:42] again and they're showing the very
[1:31:44] evidence that they're not born again but
[1:31:47] the devil always has to Copy Cat every
[1:31:51] time God
[1:31:52] moves and a cycle starts he tries to
[1:31:55] copy it as quickly as possible to say I
[1:31:58] I got it too I got it too everything God
[1:32:01] got he got God does it he does he jumps
[1:32:04] and he does that too praise the Lord and
[1:32:07] so now we talking about
[1:32:09] Revelation before they would laugh at
[1:32:12] people like me talking about
[1:32:14] Revelation I'm talking I'm telling you
[1:32:17] the
[1:32:17] facts when first of all I begin to say
[1:32:21] look we didn't just come in the message
[1:32:23] you need to have a birth out of this
[1:32:25] message oh I was scorned and laughed and
[1:32:28] pushed off to the side then they start
[1:32:31] preaching it they'll never admit that
[1:32:34] that was right but they start preaching
[1:32:37] it and everybody's now preaching it oh
[1:32:40] yes they're born again in the message
[1:32:43] then come on make a another move moving
[1:32:46] to another level again and you start to
[1:32:50] um Talk talk about you can't be born
[1:32:53] again unless God reveals it to
[1:32:56] you cannot be born again unless God
[1:32:58] reveals it to you now what happens
[1:33:01] everybody's talking about
[1:33:03] Revelation amen they will pour out um uh
[1:33:09] let's say vessels full of of information
[1:33:13] religious information even message
[1:33:17] information and then they call it
[1:33:19] Revelation because of the abundance of
[1:33:21] what they can put
[1:33:23] forth and they don't realize that that
[1:33:26] is not
[1:33:28] Revelation Revelation is Moment by
[1:33:31] moment moment by moment anytime any
[1:33:35] place it it's like that I can't fully
[1:33:38] explain it I'm just trying to give you
[1:33:39] an idea praise the
[1:33:41] Lord and they got this idea that's only
[1:33:44] to brother brandham no it's to all
[1:33:47] believers that are truly of the part of
[1:33:49] the
[1:33:50] elect
[1:33:52] amen
[1:33:54] hallelujah yes sir praise God Amen
[1:33:57] that's the way it is
[1:34:00] so Judas was very
[1:34:03] bright
[1:34:05] but and Judas was there receiving and
[1:34:08] hearing everything Jesus was preaching
[1:34:11] just as well as Peter they all were hear
[1:34:14] the very same
[1:34:17] message they were all hearing it but one
[1:34:21] there was Judas and on the other hand a
[1:34:25] uneducated Peter that can't even write
[1:34:27] his
[1:34:28] name and this one to the very end he
[1:34:32] kept trying to figure to see if there is
[1:34:34] a secret that brother Simon have the a
[1:34:37] secret that Jesus have some some little
[1:34:41] something if I can find out exactly what
[1:34:45] Jesus is doing if it's a magic trick he
[1:34:47] have with the healings
[1:34:50] and always trying to find out
[1:34:54] something and that by that proving that
[1:34:57] you don't really believe in Supernatural
[1:35:00] Revelation right because Supernatural
[1:35:03] Revelation is like that that you could
[1:35:04] be sitting right here right now and all
[1:35:07] of a sudden the Holy Spirit just
[1:35:10] say this is happening over here go here
[1:35:14] do this do you that happens
[1:35:19] today believe you me it doesn't make me
[1:35:22] or you uh some special person because
[1:35:26] among the elect we are all the same
[1:35:29] praise the Lord hallelujah yes sir
[1:35:32] sitting in a restaurant sitting with a
[1:35:34] Pentecostal um Bishop uh and the
[1:35:38] waitress comes up and she begin serving
[1:35:42] all of a sudden
[1:35:44] oh her name is Sono she comes from
[1:35:50] Sono so I said oh uh your name is soon
[1:35:53] so I just said what I
[1:35:56] heard she said how do you know that said
[1:36:00] where' you come I I said don't you live
[1:36:02] behind such and such a mall a place
[1:36:05] where where I never went uh I I don't
[1:36:08] know behind there and I'm not saying
[1:36:11] that now for you to look at me I'm just
[1:36:13] trying to tell you that this thing is
[1:36:17] alive I'm telling you it's on broadcast
[1:36:20] now
[1:36:22] it's going on
[1:36:23] now and we need to know we are a part of
[1:36:27] it thankes praise God hallelujah
[1:36:31] hallelujah blessed be his name amen she
[1:36:34] said oh my God she says I got a brother
[1:36:37] like that that he says these kinds of
[1:36:39] things and I don't understand where he
[1:36:42] get that from I said oh don't worry
[1:36:43] about that but you know maybe God is
[1:36:46] talking to you trying to get you to uh
[1:36:48] commit your soul to to him and this and
[1:36:50] that you know you know the rest of it I
[1:36:52] won't get into but that's how the Holy
[1:36:55] Spirit Works in that kind of a
[1:36:58] way but when they they hear like me
[1:37:01] talking about there some them will laugh
[1:37:04] they'll think it's a joke or like the
[1:37:07] devil always does oh he's just
[1:37:11] bragging is that right yeah you know
[1:37:14] brother Ernie FAS said brother Bram was
[1:37:16] with him in the in the vehicle and
[1:37:18] they're driving and brother Bram
[1:37:19] praising God and thanking God for what
[1:37:21] God did through him and used him in this
[1:37:24] and that and he said I just
[1:37:27] thought oh you're you're just
[1:37:30] bragging brother Bram just immediately
[1:37:32] turned and said what did you say
[1:37:34] Arnie he said oh nothing not he says
[1:37:37] come on Ernie you know better than
[1:37:44] that he said well I well I I thought you
[1:37:48] were bragging he says yes I was but not
[1:37:53] on me if you you listen closely I'm
[1:37:56] bragging like that just like David
[1:37:58] bragged on what the Lord did I'm doing
[1:38:01] that to give glory to his name for you
[1:38:03] to recognize what God is doing by his
[1:38:07] holy spirit it's real all my doubts are
[1:38:12] settled and I know by God it's real
[1:38:15] brother sister the spirit of the Lord
[1:38:18] and the power and the presence of
[1:38:19] almighty God is a life forever more
[1:38:22] behold I live I live forever more yes
[1:38:25] sir praise God Amen so we know Peter
[1:38:30] wasn't as bright as
[1:38:32] Judas ignorant
[1:38:34] unlearned couldn't even write rather BR
[1:38:37] so he couldn't even spell his name but
[1:38:40] yet the Bible says the Holy Ghost
[1:38:42] revealed to Peter and he couldn't take
[1:38:46] it he couldn't hold it he got him he
[1:38:48] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[1:38:50] living God when Jesus said who do you
[1:38:53] say I am all the rest saying well Dr so
[1:38:55] and so said you're this and you know Dr
[1:38:58] so and so brother this brother that no
[1:39:00] he said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:39:03] the Living God Jesus said Upon This Rock
[1:39:06] I'll build my church and the Gates of
[1:39:08] Hell will not Prevail against it thank
[1:39:12] you Lord amen yes sir one election and
[1:39:16] the other one reprobate to the word of
[1:39:19] God my goodness yes truly the scripture
[1:39:23] is real many are called but few are
[1:39:28] chosen amen praise God so now we talked
[1:39:33] about him coming down the Seven Seals
[1:39:35] being unveiled and through those Seven
[1:39:39] Seals uh being
[1:39:41] unveiled and because the first six were
[1:39:45] history and then after that when the
[1:39:47] seventh seal opened up you can go even
[1:39:50] now from from the book you read it all
[1:39:52] you want you can listen to all you want
[1:39:54] and and it looks like there was nothing
[1:39:56] in there he didn't identify anything
[1:39:58] because he can't at that point he can't
[1:40:01] anymore the mighty angel had come down
[1:40:04] and now he is the his own interpretor
[1:40:07] his own messenger he doesn't have to
[1:40:09] have a friend taking a note to his to
[1:40:12] his bride he can speak to her himself
[1:40:15] and so God becomes his own interpreter
[1:40:19] see a prophet is an interpreter of the
[1:40:20] word word but he doesn't need that God
[1:40:23] the great prophet becomes his own
[1:40:25] Prophet amen so he's making himself
[1:40:28] known by his Holy Spirit and you who are
[1:40:31] sitting you got to recognize of yourself
[1:40:34] when he is speaking when he is speaking
[1:40:37] to you not just to somebody else but to
[1:40:41] you and you recognize it you recognize
[1:40:44] it clear as a bell you recognize when
[1:40:47] God is speaking to you by his word amen
[1:40:52] glory to God I'm so thankful that I am
[1:40:55] one of the few and that the mystery of
[1:40:59] the Seven Seals is now unveiling and
[1:41:02] unfolding itself and calling out the
[1:41:05] names of the elect that are on the
[1:41:08] record of the book back there in the
[1:41:11] mind of God on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:41:14] that seven seal is calling out your
[1:41:18] name amen Mary
[1:41:22] you remember when he was in the
[1:41:25] garden and he was risen from the dead At
[1:41:28] first she thought it was the gardener uh
[1:41:31] she thought it was just her pastor or
[1:41:32] thought it was just the minister or she
[1:41:34] thought it was just that and it was in a
[1:41:37] sense but the fact is he wanted her to
[1:41:40] know who he really was so he says
[1:41:45] Mary well anybody could have called that
[1:41:49] word that name
[1:41:52] but she recognized the voice is that
[1:41:55] right she recognized the voice because
[1:41:58] that voice is particular to him and so
[1:42:01] when he speaks to you you will know when
[1:42:05] he's talking to
[1:42:06] you praise the name of the Lord
[1:42:09] hallelujah amen look a lot of important
[1:42:12] things happen in my life your
[1:42:16] life we all got lot of um let's say
[1:42:21] marks in our lives we could said this
[1:42:23] was a fantastic thing happened my life
[1:42:25] changed at this point my the whole
[1:42:27] trajectory of my future changed when so
[1:42:30] and so so happened you know it was a
[1:42:33] real blessing when
[1:42:36] I I I told some uh Brothers
[1:42:40] about when uh the recession they had the
[1:42:42] recession in the 80s I couldn't find a
[1:42:45] job I couldn't even buy a job nobody was
[1:42:47] giving anybody jobs and
[1:42:51] and so but when the time came and the
[1:42:53] Holy Spirit said now go and go up I
[1:42:57] walked right into a job as smooth as
[1:43:00] butter and was there for so many years
[1:43:03] by the grace of God you see was a
[1:43:05] turning point and when you get turning
[1:43:07] points in your life God can allow a
[1:43:10] certain job to come your way changes
[1:43:11] your whole life or all of a sudden out
[1:43:15] of nowhere you don't think you could get
[1:43:17] a house or you could be in a house
[1:43:19] because the economy is so bad all of a
[1:43:21] sudden God does a supernatural thing and
[1:43:25] places you right inside of a house oh my
[1:43:29] you'll never forget that for the rest of
[1:43:31] your life it's a happy event you're
[1:43:33] you're rejoicing you're joyful
[1:43:35] amen more than that none of you
[1:43:39] especially the women will never forget
[1:43:41] when their first child was
[1:43:44] born what a happy event amen oh we're
[1:43:48] just so happy certain things leaves
[1:43:51] marks in our lives that we recognize is
[1:43:54] a real blessing to us praise the Lord
[1:43:57] hallelujah but you see the greatest
[1:44:00] thing that ever happened to you or me
[1:44:03] should really be the unveiling of this
[1:44:05] word of God that has made itself blessed
[1:44:09] are your eyes that you could see and
[1:44:12] blessed are your ears that you can hear
[1:44:15] the word of God not hearing with your
[1:44:17] natural ears everybody can hear me in
[1:44:19] the building
[1:44:21] I think I preached on that and mentioned
[1:44:23] to the Believers do you know there's
[1:44:24] such such a thing as a dog
[1:44:26] whistle and I believe trainers use
[1:44:31] it you wouldn't hear
[1:44:33] anything you wouldn't hear a
[1:44:36] thing but the dogs can hear it because
[1:44:39] it's in a higher level let me use a word
[1:44:42] high higher
[1:44:43] Dimension they were built to hear that
[1:44:47] I'm not saying we are
[1:44:48] dogs but God
[1:44:51] has built us and made us as we are the
[1:44:55] pot mold this claim mold this person the
[1:44:58] individual you me every one of us mold
[1:45:02] Us in such a way that we can hear things
[1:45:05] that others can't
[1:45:08] hear it's going on right like the
[1:45:11] prophet say it's going on through the
[1:45:12] building right now I can see it but you
[1:45:15] can't see it because you don't have the
[1:45:17] equipment see but because he was
[1:45:20] ordained to be a prophet he could see it
[1:45:23] using that same Principle as the elect
[1:45:26] can hear the unwritten word because they
[1:45:30] were built to hear it it's in a higher
[1:45:33] Dimension all they're going to hear is
[1:45:35] this part of it reading of it the
[1:45:38] preaching of it they going hear all that
[1:45:40] but the other part that goes right to
[1:45:43] your soul the real True Believer
[1:45:45] recognizes and hear the word of God
[1:45:48] hallelujah amen no happiness like when I
[1:45:51] realize I can hear the word of God
[1:45:54] hallelujah none like it yes sir praise
[1:45:58] the Lord I bless God and give him all
[1:46:00] the praise and the glory and the honor
[1:46:03] here praise the Lord Jesus amen
[1:46:06] now we know all things work together for
[1:46:11] good for them that love God and to them
[1:46:15] who are called according to his purpose
[1:46:17] Romans
[1:46:19] 8:28 pray praise the Lord called
[1:46:22] according to his purpose amen so we are
[1:46:26] a purpose called
[1:46:28] people we weren't called to wander about
[1:46:32] in the wilderness is that right we were
[1:46:36] but we were called out that we may go
[1:46:39] in I said we were called out that we may
[1:46:42] go in to the promised
[1:46:44] land there bunch of them go out there
[1:46:47] have to wonder about you know wandering
[1:46:50] Stars you know I I I wonder if the
[1:46:54] prophet meant this I I wonder Oh look
[1:46:58] The Inspiration is on me because I I I
[1:47:00] don't want to go off I I let me stick
[1:47:03] with what I have to say here praise the
[1:47:05] Lord amen glory to God now you know
[1:47:10] that Judas was
[1:47:13] predestinated Pharaoh was
[1:47:16] predestinated I'm repeating actually but
[1:47:18] in a different way he was
[1:47:22] predestinated right because God had a
[1:47:25] purpose for them to see we have a
[1:47:28] purpose but they also had a purpose one
[1:47:31] for wrath and one to uh to fulfill the
[1:47:34] word and one to be the bride and to
[1:47:37] fulfill the word in another way right as
[1:47:41] such praise the Lord so this thing is
[1:47:43] like a Ra's heads now this is what I'm
[1:47:46] showing you you you you just use a term
[1:47:49] chosen you use call called any one of
[1:47:51] them is like a razor edge and takes the
[1:47:55] Holy Spirit to divide um for us to
[1:47:58] recognize what is really going on Amen
[1:48:02] so we find out that both groups are
[1:48:07] predestinated both the bride and these
[1:48:10] figures of Wrath and for damnation both
[1:48:15] uh uh were predestinated but
[1:48:17] predestinated for what one predestinated
[1:48:20] for Destruction and Damnation and
[1:48:23] fulfilling the word of God with their
[1:48:26] evil deeds and the other was also
[1:48:29] predestinated towards glory and towards
[1:48:33] being vessels to manifest
[1:48:36] him praise the Lord hallelujah so when
[1:48:39] you use these words there is the holy
[1:48:42] spirit has got to divide that for you to
[1:48:45] recognize what's really going on you say
[1:48:47] oh I'm predestinated devil says oh I'm
[1:48:49] predestinated
[1:48:51] too I got Revelation I got it too right
[1:48:56] but no he he he even can get it from God
[1:49:00] too but for his own purpose whatever
[1:49:02] God's purpose is given and be coming to
[1:49:04] show you very clearly that uh brother
[1:49:08] sister where God's spirit is uh working
[1:49:11] in such a way amen but you must
[1:49:14] understand that what God reveals to him
[1:49:20] would be totally different than what he
[1:49:22] reveals to you because he's revealing to
[1:49:26] you what you need to fulfill your
[1:49:29] purpose and to him over here he reveals
[1:49:32] what he needs to fulfill his purpose of
[1:49:36] Wrath look you don't tell me that some
[1:49:39] of those guys that get up there with a
[1:49:41] guitar and singing on the that they're
[1:49:44] not
[1:49:47] inspired but they're inspired to some
[1:49:50] something else and if you don't watch
[1:49:53] because that inspiration is there you
[1:49:56] can even be pulled into it you hear some
[1:49:59] of them singing and the drums beating
[1:50:01] and the music going and before you know
[1:50:02] it you
[1:50:05] start what did that you can feel the
[1:50:07] spirit of
[1:50:09] inspiration and you don't even know why
[1:50:11] you did that but you got to understand
[1:50:13] they're inspired to damnation and wrath
[1:50:16] and
[1:50:17] evil but the other side you're inspired
[1:50:21] to Holiness Heaven home
[1:50:24] Rapture personality of Christ in you you
[1:50:28] you inspired to that praise the Lord and
[1:50:31] that is why witches can recognize a true
[1:50:34] son is daughter of
[1:50:35] God God they can see and they can feel
[1:50:39] and they can recognize what is in you
[1:50:42] and you if you are sensitive you can
[1:50:44] recognize it too praise the Lord if you
[1:50:47] called to do that but thanks be to God
[1:50:50] so here it is brothers and sisters so it
[1:50:53] is that God's word must be fulfilled
[1:50:57] praise God hallelujah uh brother um at
[1:51:01] the end of the quotes I gave you there
[1:51:04] is the one with the a woman with the
[1:51:07] piece of cloth the cloth pattern I just
[1:51:10] brother brandham uses this he says these
[1:51:13] things but when you put it all together
[1:51:15] with understanding you can see clearly
[1:51:18] what the Lord is's telling you
[1:51:20] by telling you the story of the woman
[1:51:22] with the pattern he's actually telling
[1:51:23] you what God actually did right and so
[1:51:28] um good if they can have that up there
[1:51:31] then you'll see
[1:51:33] it look a woman is going to cut off a
[1:51:36] dress she's got a large piece of
[1:51:40] goods whatever it
[1:51:43] is and she's got a
[1:51:47] pattern she looks over this big pie
[1:51:50] peace of goods it's up to her where she
[1:51:53] lays the
[1:51:56] pattern is that right she can choose it
[1:51:58] from any part of this goods and the
[1:52:01] whole Goods is Sanctified it's clean
[1:52:04] it's election God's election so what
[1:52:07] does he do he takes my election and
[1:52:11] places this pattern of Christ anywhere
[1:52:14] he wants to on the goods then it's
[1:52:17] separated I use that word get cut
[1:52:21] out amen the rest of the goods just as
[1:52:27] holy as this part was holy but by
[1:52:32] choice that God made his choice before
[1:52:36] the foundation of the world Hallelujah I
[1:52:40] said hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[1:52:43] you're not better than anybody we not
[1:52:46] better than anybody else but God by his
[1:52:49] Divine choice CH glory to God before the
[1:52:52] foundation of the world made us who we
[1:52:54] are by his grace God rich in Mercy
[1:52:59] that's why the prophet said one in a
[1:53:01] million that pattern had gone a little
[1:53:04] this way that way that way that way you
[1:53:06] might not be within the confines of the
[1:53:08] pattern but thank God he placed Us in
[1:53:11] the pattern amen oh I'm one of his own
[1:53:15] can God can the Potter can the clay say
[1:53:19] to the
[1:53:20] why makest me
[1:53:22] thus can God who is just when he could
[1:53:26] say to Esau or Jacob before the either
[1:53:29] boy was born done right or wrong I hate
[1:53:32] Esau and I love
[1:53:34] Jacob right I put Jacob in the pattern
[1:53:38] and I put Esau outside of it it's
[1:53:41] because that by his foror knowledge he
[1:53:43] know what Esau
[1:53:46] was and what Jacob was he knows what's
[1:53:51] in man before the foundation of the
[1:53:56] world that's fine brother praise the
[1:53:58] name of the Lord Do You Believe
[1:53:59] [Applause]
[1:54:04] itall amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:54:08] God glory to God Amen the so everybody
[1:54:14] gets
[1:54:16] called but they have different purposes
[1:54:20] what this one's purpose is just to
[1:54:23] fulfill the part of being the
[1:54:26] bride and the other one's part is to be
[1:54:29] the
[1:54:31] villain and and they can't do anything
[1:54:33] else they have to be that because that's
[1:54:35] what it is God laid it out here I'm
[1:54:37] going to start winding this up praise
[1:54:39] the Lord because some of you I'm sure
[1:54:41] you want to go break break some bread
[1:54:44] or
[1:54:46] um not baked bread I'm not telling you
[1:54:48] sisters to go home and work now I'm
[1:54:51] talking about breaking bread or if you
[1:54:54] don't want to break bread you can go buy
[1:54:59] donuts Hallelujah I I just want to touch
[1:55:02] a few little things you you
[1:55:06] mind amen
[1:55:10] hallelujah now we talk a little bit
[1:55:13] about the foolish
[1:55:14] virgins how many of you know that story
[1:55:17] in the Bible but a foolish virgin
[1:55:21] there I mean know friends that uh that
[1:55:26] th These Foolish
[1:55:28] virgins uh that were there were virgins
[1:55:32] we just talk about the pattern and we
[1:55:34] just talk about oh it's the same
[1:55:37] material it's just where God chose to
[1:55:39] put the padron now I'm bringing that
[1:55:42] thought here we talking about the
[1:55:43] foolish
[1:55:44] virgins uh they were all
[1:55:47] virgins they were all holy
[1:55:50] they were all holding to the word the
[1:55:53] best they knew how right that praise the
[1:55:56] name of the Lord
[1:55:58] now brother brandham talks about when
[1:56:00] the time comes to take the mark of the
[1:56:02] beast you know the foolish virgins are
[1:56:04] going to reject
[1:56:06] that you know they're going to reject
[1:56:08] the mark of the
[1:56:09] beast because by that time when the
[1:56:13] bride is raptured and realize the
[1:56:15] Rapture is already taken
[1:56:18] place they who were foolish going to
[1:56:21] realize that they were foolish to have
[1:56:24] delayed and to not go into the fullness
[1:56:27] of the word and their Folly as the
[1:56:30] scripture says will be made manifest and
[1:56:33] when their Folly is made manifest that's
[1:56:35] all that's what makes them foolish
[1:56:37] virgins right at that time praise God so
[1:56:41] brother sister after the bride gets
[1:56:44] raptured all of a sudden now they really
[1:56:48] really believe and really going to hold
[1:56:51] the words of God's uh hold to God's word
[1:56:55] so we know that they're going to have to
[1:56:57] go through the tribulation
[1:57:00] period they're going to have to face the
[1:57:02] mark of the beast they're going to have
[1:57:04] to face persecution they're going to
[1:57:06] have to go through the
[1:57:07] tribulation uh the prophet makes it
[1:57:09] clear to be
[1:57:11] purged they're going to have to be
[1:57:13] purged and so they'll go right through
[1:57:16] all of that right into that period and
[1:57:19] then they have to come up to the white
[1:57:21] Throne judgment but thank God for the
[1:57:25] bride she doesn't have to go up to the
[1:57:27] white Throne
[1:57:28] judgment because he said if you judge
[1:57:31] yourself now by the word you shall not
[1:57:35] be judged but you already passed from
[1:57:38] death into life we will come before the
[1:57:42] Judgment seat of Christ but it will not
[1:57:44] be for judgment concerning hell and
[1:57:48] that's hell is not in in your future I
[1:57:51] let me repeat it hell is no more in your
[1:57:54] future if you are a True
[1:57:58] Believer the Judgment seat of Christ is
[1:58:01] as to
[1:58:03] rewards some will receive more some less
[1:58:07] just depends on your reward of course
[1:58:09] somebody like brother brand more rewards
[1:58:12] right like that but that's what it is
[1:58:15] but you already passed from Death onto
[1:58:18] life and pass to a place where God my
[1:58:21] friends is recognize you and God is
[1:58:26] blessing you in such a wonderful way
[1:58:29] praise the Lord hallelujah amen now I
[1:58:33] made an observation while uh looking at
[1:58:37] this that what do you call the leftover
[1:58:41] cloth
[1:58:43] after you let this Finish Well I don't
[1:58:46] know that you use scissors and that sort
[1:58:48] of stuff now these days
[1:58:52] remnants you you hear the
[1:58:55] word and the Bible uses that same word
[1:58:58] in application to certain groups of
[1:59:00] people these are
[1:59:02] remnants these are leftovers from you
[1:59:06] know and this is what God is telling you
[1:59:09] so so just like those foolish virgins
[1:59:12] they're like a Remnant right of the same
[1:59:15] pattern from which the same clause from
[1:59:19] which we were cut Hallelujah but one
[1:59:23] come out one way and one comes the other
[1:59:26] way one was in God's thoughts about that
[1:59:29] pattern and another wasn't is as simple
[1:59:32] as that amen praise God hallelujah so
[1:59:36] I'm thanking God today that God counted
[1:59:38] us worthy to escape damnation and Hell
[1:59:42] Fire he counted you worthy before you
[1:59:45] even got here amen that you are worthy
[1:59:49] to escape damnation and Hell Fire amen
[1:59:53] praise God and we won't even have to
[1:59:55] bear no mark of the beast so don't be
[1:59:58] people talking all those things going
[2:00:00] internet mark of the beast this and that
[2:00:02] and you start to get nervous and scared
[2:00:04] I hope I don't get the Mark I no how you
[2:00:07] going to get the mark you'll be me
[2:00:09] marked by the Holy Spirit I marked I'm
[2:00:12] marked everywhere I go I'm marked by the
[2:00:15] Holy Ghost amen yes sir praise God so we
[2:00:19] escape mark of the beast we escape all
[2:00:23] of that praise God because by his
[2:00:26] eternal thought by his pattern we are we
[2:00:29] are in the pattern we are in his
[2:00:31] thoughts and we're walking every step of
[2:00:34] the way with him and that's all by his
[2:00:37] Mercy we wouldn't have to go through
[2:00:39] tribulation we would have to go through
[2:00:42] persecution for for for um uh purging
[2:00:46] and all of that we would have to go
[2:00:47] through any of that Hallelujah and we
[2:00:50] are counted worthy to leave this earth
[2:00:54] Hallelujah you're counted worthy that
[2:00:57] you are to leave this earth and we go to
[2:00:59] our home beyond the blue not the literal
[2:01:02] Skies like this but we're going into the
[2:01:05] presence of almighty God many are
[2:01:09] called few are
[2:01:12] chosen wedding
[2:01:14] guest or
[2:01:17] bride I can't say that and no Pastor can
[2:01:22] get up and say that you
[2:01:25] bride and giving you a false hope when
[2:01:30] you yourself don't know where you stand
[2:01:32] with
[2:01:33] God each one today has got to come to
[2:01:38] personal and
[2:01:41] individual self
[2:01:43] Accounting in the presence of almighty
[2:01:45] God whether you do it here in church
[2:01:48] whether you you do it at home in your
[2:01:50] quiet time in prayer talking to God and
[2:01:54] let the Holy
[2:01:56] Spirit made known to
[2:01:59] you
[2:02:00] amen
[2:02:02] hallelujah now Romans
[2:02:06] 98 uh I'm I'm trying to stretch you out
[2:02:09] as much as I can am look it's it's just
[2:02:13] what it's just about a few minutes to
[2:02:15] one I'm going use every minute uh praise
[2:02:18] the Lord got R therefore
[2:02:23] he therefore ha he Mercy on whom he will
[2:02:26] have
[2:02:27] mercy and
[2:02:30] whom he will he Harden at I want to talk
[2:02:35] about how uh Pharaoh many times you know
[2:02:38] Pharaoh was going to give in to Moses
[2:02:40] but then God steep in and hardened his
[2:02:43] heart because he has to fulfill a
[2:02:46] purpose he has to fulfill a purpose of
[2:02:49] doing what he did so God kind of
[2:02:51] hardened his heart right there amen
[2:02:54] hallelujah so there we see it
[2:02:58] continue thou Willl say then unto me why
[2:03:03] do he yet find fault for who hath
[2:03:06] resisted his
[2:03:10] will nay but man who art thou that the
[2:03:13] repli against God shall the thing form
[2:03:15] say to him that formed it why hast Thou
[2:03:17] made me thus
[2:03:20] right and say well why did God choose
[2:03:22] him to be bright and her to because he
[2:03:25] knows what's in
[2:03:27] man he knows praise the Lord hallelujah
[2:03:32] let's continue the scripture the power
[2:03:35] part power over the clay over the same
[2:03:37] lump to make one vessel over the same
[2:03:39] lump to make one
[2:03:42] vessel and of honor and using the same
[2:03:46] lump make another of Dishonor
[2:03:51] you see that is it's the same principle
[2:03:54] with the pattern but it's showing you
[2:03:56] God has the power he has the right
[2:03:59] because he is the P we are the clay and
[2:04:02] he can make one to be a disposal unit
[2:04:05] and take the other one and make it a
[2:04:07] dinner plate on his table that's God's
[2:04:10] choice amen it's not you going and say I
[2:04:14] take Jesus as my savior you take him you
[2:04:18] took that man to be your husband or
[2:04:19] should he make the
[2:04:21] choice huh so so back to the word and
[2:04:25] recognize what God has done and what is
[2:04:28] doing and that's why we understand all
[2:04:30] these teachings that it's not what you
[2:04:32] doing here is going to change his mind
[2:04:34] you can't change his mind oh oh my that
[2:04:38] brother backslid well he got his own
[2:04:40] Journey he going to have to deal with
[2:04:42] that when he get in the presence of God
[2:04:44] but if he's an elected seed God will
[2:04:46] deal with that that's not my business to
[2:04:48] talk about about him deal with that let
[2:04:50] God deal with that but I'm pressing on
[2:04:52] the upward Way New Heights I'm gaining
[2:04:55] every day praise God hallelujah glory to
[2:04:58] God amen amen the holy spirit is telling
[2:05:01] me
[2:05:01] stop but it's so
[2:05:06] juicy I just want to sink my teeth more
[2:05:09] into the word but right now God bless

[2:08:54] behind uh our precious brother Danny who
[2:08:57] is here who will be the minister that
[2:09:00] will
[2:09:01] follow uh in my
[2:09:05] footsteps and preach and declare the
[2:09:07] word of
[2:09:08] God because David had armor
[2:09:12] bearers
[2:09:14] and they were right there Moses had
[2:09:18] Joshua when they were fighting the
[2:09:20] battle and his arm got tired sometimes
[2:09:23] he got overwhelmed his arm they raised
[2:09:26] his hands up right and so God has to
[2:09:31] always have men and women like that in
[2:09:34] the
[2:09:35] church to support the ministry in every
[2:09:40] way not just by attending church it's
[2:09:43] more than that it's a life that's in you
[2:09:47] that responds to the word of the hour
[2:09:50] and we're all trying to take the message
[2:09:52] out to the world now I believe another
[2:09:55] surge of the holy spirit is started and
[2:10:01] it's
[2:10:02] coming and you you be in position to
[2:10:06] receive
[2:10:07] it you may have so much work to
[2:10:11] do it don't seem like that yet some of
[2:10:14] you may end up in teaching in a z
[2:10:17] school some some of you who are sitting
[2:10:19] here may end up being uh you know
[2:10:23] people on the church board whether
[2:10:26] trustee whether deacons the rest of us
[2:10:30] are getting older we serve our purpose
[2:10:34] maybe we continue a bit more but others
[2:10:37] being raised up by the grace of God to
[2:10:39] fill our places and our positions praise
[2:10:43] the Lord amen praise the Lord amen I
[2:10:46] want to know I'm in contact with you and
[2:10:47] as you listen listening to what I'm
[2:10:49] saying here don't want to go out there
[2:10:51] and say oh well brother Simon didn't
[2:10:53] tell us I didn't hear I want you to know
[2:10:56] this because it's actually happening the
[2:10:59] cycle of life is repeating
[2:11:03] again I told them I said look God used
[2:11:06] myself and the other ministers of a
[2:11:08] certain Lifetime and age and for his own
[2:11:11] purpose and we were kind of in a rough
[2:11:14] crude way used to chop down all the big
[2:11:18] tall
[2:11:19] trees um and light
[2:11:25] fires chase out all the
[2:11:28] snakes that were trying to hide in the
[2:11:31] congregations and sometimes God use us
[2:11:35] in a rough crude way like
[2:11:38] buzas and uh uh to drive those things
[2:11:42] out but it was for his purpose that um
[2:11:46] men were built like that and us used by
[2:11:48] God for his own
[2:11:51] Glory but now after
[2:11:54] Moses it's
[2:11:56] changing it's going over to the Joshua
[2:12:01] generation it's coming over to
[2:12:04] you who have got to take the same
[2:12:07] word and maybe you will apply it in a
[2:12:10] different
[2:12:12] manner brother Brandon was waiting to
[2:12:14] see men and women that will come into
[2:12:16] this uh eight Church St this Capstone
[2:12:20] hour and see how they behave and how
[2:12:22] they live and act and I believe he's
[2:12:24] looking and seeing because we are in
[2:12:26] compassed with a cloud of
[2:12:29] witnesses and so I I am going to now sit
[2:12:33] back and watch from the end of the year
[2:12:36] and see what the holy spirit is going to
[2:12:38] do through
[2:12:39] you because you have a great time a
[2:12:42] great
[2:12:45] opportunity you have not gone this way
[2:12:47] before for in other words God was
[2:12:49] telling Joshua I know you don't know the
[2:12:52] way but I know the way you just follow
[2:12:55] me and once you follow me I'll make sure
[2:12:58] you have good
[2:13:00] success so I want every one of you here
[2:13:03] now get behind the
[2:13:09] ministry Hallelujah right get behind the
[2:13:13] ministry praise the Lord support the
[2:13:16] ministry praise the Lord in every way
[2:13:20] that means you don't eat at this
[2:13:23] restaurant over here and then go over to
[2:13:26] the next church and pay your ties over
[2:13:31] there how you get quiet all of a
[2:13:35] sudden let me say it again just stop and
[2:13:39] think if you at at the manding
[2:13:44] restaurant and then you get up to leave
[2:13:47] and they say well you supposed to pay
[2:13:48] say I will pay but I want to go over
[2:13:51] there and pay over at Swiss shallal they
[2:13:55] said no no no no no no that cannot work
[2:13:57] you got to pay where you
[2:14:01] at and
[2:14:02] so be faithful pay your
[2:14:06] ties right pay your
[2:14:09] ties and when you pay your
[2:14:11] ties it's God's
[2:14:14] ties we'll talk further on that but the
[2:14:16] fact is
[2:14:18] uh God uses that because now God will
[2:14:21] use that to be able to support the
[2:14:23] minister and the ministry for his glory
[2:14:26] and honor but the main point I was
[2:14:28] making to them is that you young men
[2:14:31] Step Up surround our
[2:14:34] brother and defend our
[2:14:37] brother physically and
[2:14:40] spiritually one time brother BR in the
[2:14:42] pulpit and he's telling a story of the
[2:14:44] pastor in the pulpit and a guy comes in
[2:14:46] with a shotgun and the deacons leave him
[2:14:49] to come right to the front to go shoot
[2:14:51] the pastor he says real deacons would
[2:14:54] have wrestled him already to the ground
[2:14:57] oh you don't think that uh Christians
[2:15:00] should do that oh I'm a Christian I
[2:15:01] can't stop him no we're not that kind of
[2:15:05] Christian you got to defend the ministry
[2:15:08] physically and spiritually you also must
[2:15:11] defend the
[2:15:12] ministry right no side issues nothing
[2:15:17] let that you can't take anything from
[2:15:20] anywhere that would cast a light on
[2:15:22] Ministry in any way are you going to be
[2:15:25] in a
[2:15:26] desert you already have an oasis of
[2:15:29] water and then here comes a guy and he
[2:15:32] wants to throw mud in it he wants to
[2:15:34] throw poison in it you don't want that
[2:15:38] you want to keep that water flowing
[2:15:40] clear so you want to protect that Oasis
[2:15:43] that you can have the best use of it may
[2:15:46] God bless every one of you
[2:15:48] man woman boy girl every one of you
[2:15:53] support the man of
[2:15:56] God support the
[2:15:58] ministry as he carries the word remember
[2:16:01] this is all
[2:16:03] new and there's going to be a learning
[2:16:05] curve so but he's been with you for
[2:16:08] years yes but now he becomes the last
[2:16:12] word everybody's going to be hanging on
[2:16:14] every word every
[2:16:16] action
[2:16:18] and it's not as simple and easy as you
[2:16:21] think so pray pray pray for him pray for
[2:16:26] his family pray for his
[2:16:29] wife God will help her strengthen her in
[2:16:33] this hour
[2:16:34] keeper and I know why I'm saying it
[2:16:36] because they need it and the evil that
[2:16:40] they will have to face me no doubt will
[2:16:41] be even more than and more sophisticated
[2:16:44] than I face uh so there will need the
[2:16:48] spirit of Revelation the spirit of God
[2:16:50] to use them for his glory and honor God
[2:16:53] bless every one of you and I will send
[2:16:56] your regard and your thankfulness to the
[2:16:59] um organization that gifted us uh this
