========================================
but him. What a what a blessing. It's a fighter not only to preach it but to live it and to get to that place with God to overcome yourselves. But when you get to that place, saints, what a blessed place. It's a place that you've always desired and always wanted to be. Get there. Don't stop. Don't look to the right, to the left. Don't listen to any other voice but what the word has said. Hallelujah. get in the word. Thank you, Lord. Let's pray. [Music] Father, you Jesus. [Music] Oh God, we're yours, Lord. [Music] You have spoken this morning by your spirit, the word of [Music] God. I believe that with all my heart, Father, this is not pride of who I am. I'm nothing, Lord. I don't deserve anything of your blessings, Lord, that you give me. But I desire one thing, Father. to look into your face on that day and hear you say been so rejected from the world and so rejected for people so put down at times but just to hear you say well done good and faithful servant enter in all that matters to me Lord I I know without your spirit in your life and what the cross did for me, Lord, I wouldn't be able to have this privilege, Father, to walk with you, talk with you. Oh, God. It's not man that the bride is looking to anymore, Father. She's only looking at one man, and that's you. I pray this morning, Father, that only you could do. I'm asking only something that you can do, Father. You asked me to believe and I believe this morning, Father, you asked the people to believe. Father, I'm asking you to to to set the people free. I'm not saying that this flesh is not going to bother that the sin the sin will always be in this flesh, Lord. We know that by the word. I hope we see that this morning, Father. This card of mind will always be there. That's that it always struggle and fight against us, Lord. We stick you right to the end. But there's something greater. That's right. What I'm asking for is deliverance, Lord. To set the people free from the unbelief that's in their heart that makes them believe that they are that man. But they are not that man. That man has been redeemed. Hallelujah. There's nails in your hands, Lord. Holes, because you redeemed this flesh. Your body was torn apart. So now, even though I'm walking in this body, Lord, and I'm seeing the sin in this body, and I'm doing things that I don't want to do, and things I should do, I'm not doing at times, I can still have the joy of the Lord. I still have the faith to believe and walk with God. That's right. I still can get victory, Lord. And so can your people, Father. That's right. Let them believe that in their hearts this morning, Father. And I believe every devil that's holding them back, lying to them, trapping them, keeping them in prison will loose this morning. Father, hallelujah. only believe in the name of Jesus Christ. As you believe for your need this morning, do you believe his word this morning? In the name of Jesus, in my name, you'll cast out devils. Speak the word and go forth. Loose the people, Satan. Yes, Lord. Every sin that's holding them and trapped with their souls, loose them this morning in the name of Jesus Christ. Every spirit of condemnation, guilt, every spirit of fear, every lying spirit from the pits of hell, every spirit, complex spirits, demon from hell that's holding through the body of this flesh, you loose them this morning in the name of Jesus Christ. Believe his word. Oh Lord, Jesus. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Jesus. Oh, worship him, saints. Release yourself. Release yourself. Believe. Release that believing. Release that believing. Believe his word this morning. Thank you, Lord. In the name of Jesus, I believe. Lord, I in the name of Jesus, I believe. I give you my soul. Oh yes, Lord. Yes. Worship her. Worship her. He'll [Music] come for your Lord. I give you my heart. I give you my soul. [Music] I live for you. I everywhere [Music] I have your Lord. I give you my heart. I give you my soul. [Music] I live for you. Every [Music] single way.
