[31:36] Paul

[31:40] that we all knew he prosecuted the
[31:43] Church of God
[31:46] but God's grace came to him
[31:51] and one Grace came to Paul believe me
[31:55] Paul did a lot of God work
[32:01] Grace was upon Paul even though the man
[32:04] taught one point
[32:08] God came to him and says my grace is
[32:11] sufficient for thee
[32:14] the bride are this hour
[32:16] I'm hearing some wrinkle on the uh
[32:21] the thing there are some small things so
[32:25] please help me to lower it up
[32:28] the bride for this hour
[32:33] God come fail us because there's one
[32:37] thing
[32:38] sorry I forgot about the song
[32:41] but when I'm finishing you're gonna put
[32:43] it
[32:44] God's grace
[32:48] is giving to us
[32:52] that no matter how we think
[32:56] or no matter
[32:59] Where We Are
[33:01] his grace is always upon us
[33:05] his grace is gonna carry us through
[33:09] it's not law
[33:11] anybody preaching law
[33:14] is up the mark
[33:17] it's all about Grace at this hour
[33:21] God is telling his bride
[33:24] you even while you were yet sinner
[33:28] God
[33:31] Spirit was upon you
[33:33] because he chose you before the
[33:36] foundations of God before the
[33:38] foundations of the world and the
[33:40] children of God has not sin because of
[33:43] the seed of God
[33:46] when the serpent
[33:48] thought he has seduced if
[33:51] so he has captured all God's seed now I
[33:56] finish all of them that are on the head
[33:59] but what he didn't know was
[34:02] it was God's plan
[34:04] it was gonna show Grace
[34:08] it was bringing Grace to You and I and
[34:12] bringing Grace to All God's Children
[34:15] because Abraham
[34:18] if you look
[34:19] Abraham lied
[34:22] Moses killed Egyptian
[34:25] David
[34:27] commit adultery Mary Magdalene commit
[34:31] adultery
[34:35] I have five men and even the one he was
[34:38] living
[34:39] wasn't his husband he was committing
[34:41] what adultery but what the devil failed
[34:45] to recognize many attacks
[34:48] even when we came to the message when
[34:51] God brought us from the world
[34:53] we look like who is sitting here most of
[34:56] us we used to look like grasshoppers
[35:00] we were like nobody
[35:03] but what
[35:05] the devil didn't know most of all the
[35:08] time
[35:09] God
[35:11] there was no Beauty when he came to the
[35:13] world to desire of him
[35:17] so God hide himself
[35:20] through his children and sometimes when
[35:23] they come everybody can push them around
[35:25] this way that way this way that way why
[35:29] they may doing why they are doing that
[35:32] what they are doing is there's no Beauty
[35:36] to desire of him
[35:39] God hiding himself in Simplicity reveal
[35:43] himself in Simplicity and today you and
[35:47] I God has taken our heart the seed that
[35:52] was in us and show us
[35:55] all that was in God eternity things God
[36:00] has poured into us at this hour through
[36:04] the faithful Ministry through Pastor
[36:07] Simon he has pour all the eternity
[36:11] things that the world before the
[36:15] foundations of this world pays that God
[36:18] hid to himself
[36:20] at this hour he has let all those things
[36:24] come down to his wife and it is you and
[36:28] I
[36:29] that God has done that too his grace has
[36:33] come upon you
[36:34] God cannot fail you he is real let me
[36:39] tell you how God is real
[36:42] no matter what you think you are
[36:45] let me tell you you are God
[36:48] Apple I you are the beauty of God Apple
[36:52] I because he loved you so much
[36:56] never mind
[36:58] your flesh the mistakes don't mean
[37:01] nothing
[37:03] because you know what
[37:05] that's what the devil does
[37:08] look at the woman of the world when you
[37:11] Jesus met her at the evening the reason
[37:14] why he met her at the evening that woman
[37:17] couldn't go there early in the morning
[37:19] or early in the afternoon because the
[37:22] people will laugh at her she was a
[37:24] prostitute
[37:25] so they would speak against her look at
[37:29] the prostitute woman you are prostitute
[37:31] you look so ugly you sleeping with every
[37:35] man
[37:36] very mothering the same thing right but
[37:40] the seed of God was lying down in her
[37:43] heart the devil has poured mud upon her
[37:47] so that
[37:50] everybody will push her around push her
[37:53] around but deep down in her heart was
[37:56] the seed of God and so is you one time
[38:00] you were living in the world
[38:02] in the mud the seed of God was laying
[38:06] down in you that people
[38:10] don't recognize that you that was
[38:14] working you are the seed of God hidden
[38:17] in flesh but now by the grace of God God
[38:22] has pulled that seed out every month
[38:27] that the seed was hidden is now pushed
[38:31] has pushed out for you to know yourself
[38:33] that you are not just a woman being
[38:37] coming here die and go and just finish
[38:40] but you are the seed of God you are the
[38:43] bride of Christ you are born of his born
[38:47] flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit
[38:51] you are Eternal as God is his Turner he
[38:55] created you as his spirit is you came
[39:00] from him you are flesh of his flesh born
[39:04] of his bone now you know who you are
[39:06] walk with not sadness walk would high up
[39:13] that you know who you are no matter what
[39:16] come against you God is able to take you
[39:19] through he says my grace is sufficient
[39:22] for me my grace is sufficient for thee
[39:27] who is he that gonna condemn you
[39:30] who can condemn God's seed When God says
[39:35] you are pure you are pure When God Says
[39:38] You Are Holy You Are Holy When God says
[39:40] I love you
[39:43] I love you more than what you think
[39:47] never mind what you see yourself I am
[39:51] the one that has brought you here
[39:54] I am the one that is speaking to you
[39:57] I am the one that led the children of
[40:01] Israel
[40:02] when I chose my servant Moses to lead
[40:06] the children of Israel anybody that
[40:09] speak against him I won't I deal with
[40:13] him
[40:14] I chose Joshua Caleb
[40:17] to go into the promised land because
[40:20] they have the spirit of God in them the
[40:24] seed of God and so is this hour anybody
[40:28] that I chose
[40:30] nobody Point her finger nobody
[40:34] talk against them because my sheep know
[40:38] my voice my sheep is my children my
[40:43] sheep I share my blood for my sheep and
[40:47] my own they will come to me I will
[40:50] discipline them I will show them the way
[40:54] I will direct them
[40:57] let me tell you God never failed his
[41:00] grace look at the Bible
[41:04] Moses a murderer and yet he went to
[41:09] pharaoh let my people go
[41:12] who do you think was that poor
[41:15] killed allowed them to kill Steven
[41:18] and yet Paul come
[41:21] the whole of mostly all the New
[41:24] Testament Paul wrote it
[41:27] Paul wrote it why the grace of God
[41:31] the grace
[41:33] abundance to Paul
[41:36] abundance to bosses
[41:38] Peter Electric
[41:40] couldn't read and write John
[41:42] and yet the grace of God goes to them
[41:45] what do you think it was it was the seed
[41:48] of God in that it's not how educated you
[41:51] are may God choose your uneducated may
[41:55] God choose you is God perfect will
[41:59] by his own election
[42:02] he elected you
[42:05] and place you in him now he has put you
[42:09] in flesh you are the one that fulfilling
[42:12] the scripture
[42:14] the scripture is you
[42:17] what do you think is Irish is somebody
[42:19] coming no
[42:21] the Bible says the spirit of Jesus
[42:24] Christ the spirit of the Bride are one
[42:28] and it's you
[42:30] if you don't know yourself I am seeing
[42:33] the pill of fire sitting sitting here in
[42:36] the bodies
[42:37] what do you think it is it's God
[42:41] in the beginning was what the word and
[42:44] the Word was what with God and the word
[42:45] made what flesh
[42:48] when the word made flesh who do you
[42:50] think
[42:52] this is your hour
[42:54] this is your time don't estimate
[42:57] yourself
[42:58] because what has happened is
[43:01] people has used legalistic to bind even
[43:05] in the message bind the people
[43:09] legalistics
[43:11] bind the people
[43:13] all the prophet was preaching
[43:16] for the bride was Grace great great
[43:20] grace
[43:25] that message was three class of people
[43:28] make unbeliever make believer and
[43:31] Believer by the True Believer and the
[43:33] wife of Christ
[43:35] so your passion is what Grace
[43:39] Grace
[43:42] you recognize Who You Are
[43:45] and you walk in the word
[43:47] and the Lord will lead you every step
[43:51] you take
[43:52] there is Grace for you that's why God
[43:55] says while you were yet sinner
[43:59] you read the scripture let me read it
[44:01] again for you to see Ephesians 1. he
[44:04] says
[44:07] according as he has chosen Us in him
[44:11] in him before the foundations of the
[44:14] world that we should
[44:17] we should be holy and without blemish
[44:21] before
[44:22] him in love
[44:24] having predestinated us unto adoption of
[44:29] children by Jesus Christ unto himself
[44:34] so God has predestinated you
[44:38] it's not your father did it is not even
[44:42] good never did it
[44:45] is Jesus Christ that did it
[44:50] that's why you you can't give this
[44:53] salvation to your children
[44:55] a lot of them think this message is a
[44:59] Muslim
[45:00] Muhammad
[45:02] the father put his head Allah then the
[45:05] child come Allah Allah
[45:08] this is
[45:12] genuine Christian
[45:17] and God says I will have mercy
[45:20] upon whom I will have it whom I don't
[45:24] want it I'm hitting it
[45:26] to be in the back I'll take one
[45:30] I will leave one
[45:32] we can't give it to our children we'll
[45:34] pray for them we'll bring them to church
[45:37] if there is elect and the seed of God
[45:40] once the word hit it I don't care what
[45:44] more the devil has done for putting on
[45:48] their flesh once the word hit it
[45:52] you will see every mod have to move out
[45:54] of the way that seed is Gonna Shine when
[45:59] Jesus spoke to Mary madarian says go
[46:02] home and see no more do you find the
[46:05] scripture where Mary mothering was
[46:07] committing adultery again do you find
[46:09] the scripture where the Samaritan woman
[46:11] have five men after meeting Jesus and
[46:15] going and and committing that act again
[46:19] no because as soon as the word come and
[46:24] spoken to them that seed open when that
[46:28] seed open let me tell you God's children
[46:31] are ego I was watching some eagle
[46:35] he was way up and he saw snake cobra
[46:41] and the eagle
[46:43] fly sometimes I love that nature he fly
[46:47] he didn't just come and kill the snake
[46:49] he just used one of his leg hit the
[46:53] snake bottom the the tail like the tail
[46:57] and that snake just rise up like that
[47:00] and the eagle was watching
[47:02] now in other words he's telling that
[47:05] snake shut up I'm gonna destroy you
[47:09] all right and the snake rise up like
[47:13] that and Eagle just use the another leg
[47:17] on his neck like this and he started to
[47:20] eat him in flesh that's how God's
[47:23] children are
[47:24] we are not made as chickens
[47:29] we are made as Eagles
[47:31] and eagles eat what flesh
[47:35] that's why the scripture says where the
[47:37] characters
[47:38] we got it the flesh word of God
[47:42] is what the eagles eat God sent us a
[47:46] prophet William Brown
[47:48] since this 20th century there's never
[47:52] been a prophet
[47:54] that has come on this earth like William
[47:56] Brown
[47:57] let me tell you
[47:59] the man spoke
[48:01] when you listen to the his messages
[48:05] his
[48:06] the wave he present the way
[48:09] let me tell you if this is not Christ in
[48:13] a man I don't know a prophet I don't
[48:15] know no prophet
[48:18] I don't know no prophet
[48:21] he was the man that's why the world hate
[48:25] him
[48:26] the word of the religious world doesn't
[48:28] like him
[48:30] but even all those that accuse him
[48:32] whether they like it or not they're
[48:34] going to see the prophecy come to pass
[48:36] everything he speaks
[48:39] that Los Angeles will go under the sea
[48:42] once he says does fear the lord is
[48:45] coming
[48:47] that's how you're going to be because
[48:50] spoken word is the Original Seed now the
[48:54] spoken word is in God's wife we are what
[48:57] William Brown was preaching we are here
[49:01] if you don't know who you are for me I
[49:04] know who I am
[49:06] I am one
[49:07] that William Abraham was speaking
[49:10] I'm here
[49:11] now tomorrow I will come not future I'll
[49:15] come here you are here
[49:19] so take authority over the world the
[49:22] word that God has given to you hold it
[49:27] Don't Put It Down
[49:29] because God
[49:30] is able to do what he says he will do
[49:34] his grace cover you
[49:37] his grace protects you
[49:39] it was grace that brought them out of
[49:42] Egypt to the Israel where they are now
[49:45] and his grace
[49:47] that will take us home
[49:49] it's not by law it's not by legalistic
[49:52] it's not by religious entertainment is
[49:56] not by how much you know how much you
[49:59] don't know or this all you need to do is
[50:02] Lord I don't know
[50:04] whatever you want me to do I am willing
[50:08] to do whether he says sleep here you
[50:11] sleep wake up you wake up walk you walk
[50:15] don't talk you don't talk speak then you
[50:18] speak that is the way God is asking his
[50:21] bride be who you are
[50:25] what you are not let me tell you the
[50:29] truth if he doesn't open my mind to
[50:32] speak me you will see the biggest dummy
[50:36] person you'll ever find but I don't
[50:39] trust myself
[50:41] I trust him
[50:43] if he can do it I can't
[50:47] that's why I don't know why you're gonna
[50:50] get me some coffee I'm bringing you down
[50:54] here
[50:55] you think I miss perfect I see Pastor
[50:59] Simon I see
[51:01] the way preachers go through
[51:04] even to stand in the prophet sometimes
[51:07] you stand here you're going tries
[51:09] brother Danny will tell you the wife
[51:12] will know it's not something Pastor
[51:14] Simon has gone through a lot
[51:17] a lot of things
[51:20] preachers who speak against you
[51:23] when you become a preacher
[51:25] let's pray for our pastor
[51:29] let's pray for his children all the time
[51:32] pray for the deacons it's not dark to be
[51:36] a leader they criticize you
[51:40] I know
[51:42] you said brother coffee how do you know
[51:43] I know
[51:45] I know
[51:48] how leaders sometimes
[51:51] they are crying behind the scene
[51:54] but God when he chose he chose you you
[51:58] can't do nothing you can't run away you
[52:01] can't do whatever they you want
[52:05] you have to say Lord not my will
[52:08] that I will be done
[52:11] Jesus even while he was in the flesh
[52:14] says father
[52:18] if this cup
[52:21] if it have to pass let it pass but not
[52:24] my will but I will
[52:27] because he wants the father's will
[52:30] so let us
[52:32] as believers
[52:34] as Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[52:38] let us therefore
[52:40] surrender ourselves
[52:42] to him that not our will because we
[52:47] women beings have Earthly will
[52:50] your mother wants you to become like
[52:52] this your father want you to become like
[52:54] this yeah they expect you the
[52:57] expectation on the the natural things
[53:01] are too high
[53:03] but sometimes that's not the way God
[53:06] wants you
[53:07] listen even me I was telling about him
[53:10] why I was a kid
[53:12] okay I heard the voice and the voice
[53:15] spoke to me I saw a plane
[53:18] it says when you grow you're going to be
[53:19] sitting playing and going and coming I
[53:21] think I hope as a sermon before
[53:23] so I thought okay I figure it out I'm
[53:27] gonna be a pilot
[53:29] since I was a kid in Africa I figure me
[53:33] I'm gonna be Apollo that voice that's
[53:36] Apollo
[53:38] so all in my heart
[53:40] was to become a pilot
[53:43] and I love sitting in the plane
[53:48] and you know it was not so
[53:51] okay it was not so
[53:55] even
[53:56] living with the families
[53:59] my uncle whom I live with very educated
[54:02] never open book can show me one day
[54:06] my brother as soon as I start school he
[54:09] went to the big high school brother
[54:11] Philip will tell you prepare College
[54:14] nobody my father cannot reach so he can
[54:17] teach me my mother can teach me
[54:20] I get stuck in school
[54:22] so living with my uncle but at the age
[54:27] of let's say 15 I'm sitting in the class
[54:30] I'm seeing myself going out of the Ghana
[54:34] country
[54:36] the body is sitting in Ghana but I'm
[54:39] seeing myself outside of Ghana
[54:42] so at the age of 17
[54:45] I got a desire to go out
[54:48] regardless food riches day you tell me
[54:52] anything no I'm going out
[54:55] I am just going what my heart
[54:59] is leading me
[55:03] and I came to Nigeria struggle upon
[55:06] struggles did that so to carry shop when
[55:10] I reach Canada here 1985
[55:13] I says now I'm free
[55:15] I'm gonna go to school
[55:17] me that pilot I'm gonna become
[55:21] and once I'm in advanced country I'm
[55:23] gonna I'm gonna do everything to go get
[55:26] it
[55:27] I used to go to school Jane and Shepard
[55:29] the Catholic School up there
[55:31] midnight wake in the morning in the
[55:34] evening go to classes but when they
[55:37] teach me
[55:38] everything they teach me as soon as I
[55:40] get out everything gone from my head
[55:43] what is this I was blaming my uncle
[55:47] blame me blame me blame me one day I was
[55:50] standing in jail and Finch all of a
[55:53] sudden a voice the same voice spoke to
[55:55] me and the child spoke again so you I
[55:58] will never let you be educated
[56:01] that thing almost killed me
[56:06] kill me in my heart was like somebody
[56:09] has to use a knife and stuck on my heart
[56:13] my desire is gone so that means I'm
[56:15] going to be laboring the rest of my life
[56:19] I know how education can make your life
[56:22] change Natural Life
[56:24] but not knowing god have a plan
[56:28] one thing I know when that voice spoke
[56:30] to me he'd been speaking to me
[56:33] since I'm child leading me from Nigeria
[56:37] went to Libya put me in jail that voice
[56:41] got me out brought me to Ghana take me
[56:43] to Germany I get in the flame prostitute
[56:46] why the prostitute the Lord says go and
[56:49] talk to her I didn't know it was the
[56:51] Lord I go the girl helped me with his
[56:54] pink guy they put me into a good place
[56:56] in Germany I had no problem everywhere I
[56:59] go Jesus is with me he never let me
[57:03] alone
[57:04] help me
[57:06] now I know
[57:08] that the grace of God
[57:12] not my will
[57:15] but his will
[57:18] not my will
[57:21] but his will whatever he wants me
[57:25] at this point
[57:27] I'm ready
[57:28] I am not gonna do my own way
[57:33] whatever whether it's on the floor
[57:35] whether it's on gato whether it's up
[57:39] whether it's down I am willing because
[57:43] without him I am nothing
[57:46] so forget of yourself God
[57:52] have his way in your life
[57:55] God should have his way in my life
[57:58] because without him
[58:01] we are what nothing
[58:04] without God
[58:06] I am nothing but I'm so thankful to the
[58:10] Lord
[58:12] for his word
[58:14] that's why when I came to church here
[58:18] I says to myself I can't read and write
[58:21] in my heart
[58:23] as soon as they called me to cream
[58:26] it doesn't bother me
[58:28] because
[58:30] once is the Lord Kingdom whether sheep
[58:33] in the floor whether cleaning the
[58:36] washroom whether anything I'm gonna do
[58:38] for this to support the kingdom God move
[58:42] that's what I want to do
[58:45] and that's what a True Believer must do
[58:48] you do it with all your height with all
[58:51] your might
[58:53] with all your soul
[58:55] with all everything that is in you
[58:59] you do it
[59:01] so that God will get the glory
[59:05] not doing for pastors to see you or meet
[59:08] a deacon to see you or trust you or
[59:10] whoever to see you properly no
[59:14] we don't do things like that
[59:16] and you come to church don't just
[59:20] squeeze your child praise God
[59:24] one-time job
[59:26] was a man
[59:28] and has so many tries
[59:32] and job
[59:34] what thinking how amazing he is
[59:38] cares everything holy God he didn't
[59:41] curse
[59:42] and one day God by his grace came to job
[59:46] took the mind of job from Air to
[59:49] Eternity
[59:50] to show him said job when I lay the
[59:55] foundations of the world where were you
[59:58] job was seeing himself praising God some
[1:00:02] of you need that shaken up
[1:00:05] when that God showed to you who you
[1:00:09] really are you sitting in eternity
[1:00:12] praising God when he was laying the
[1:00:14] foundations of the world you were with
[1:00:16] him you saw yourself there
[1:00:19] you think sorrow's gonna fill your heart
[1:00:22] like Pastor someone was saying Sunday if
[1:00:25] you praise God up there down here you're
[1:00:28] gonna praise God
[1:00:30] if you shout out there down here you're
[1:00:33] gonna Shout
[1:00:34] so job saw himself
[1:00:37] praising God of death
[1:00:40] job saw his name written before the
[1:00:44] foundations of the world with God that
[1:00:48] John all the boys that was on job job
[1:00:52] didn't care no more
[1:00:54] job get into the spirit of God and job
[1:01:00] saw himself giving all the glory and
[1:01:04] praises to God job
[1:01:07] once he began to give praises to God
[1:01:11] even show him if the conquer worms and
[1:01:15] the caterpillars and what it is flesh
[1:01:19] yet in his flesh he will see God
[1:01:23] that should be our desire
[1:01:26] that should be our worship of God you
[1:01:29] think when job saw that and he come and
[1:01:33] let's say in our day job is here Pastor
[1:01:36] someone has got into the pulpit
[1:01:37] preaching he won't Shout
[1:01:39] you think you're gonna be like a like a
[1:01:42] just like a dead wood sitting down there
[1:01:46] with his mouth can open and Shout
[1:01:49] job gonna praise God
[1:01:54] job gonna Rejoice because you have seen
[1:01:57] himself
[1:01:59] what the Lord has done for him that
[1:02:02] there's no more dead can hold him absent
[1:02:06] from this body gonna be present with the
[1:02:08] Lord that thing should be reality now to
[1:02:11] you as a Believer not future
[1:02:15] all what you are hearing is the word of
[1:02:18] God made flesh to you
[1:02:21] now
[1:02:22] present stage of the Lord Ministry
[1:02:26] he's revealing all that was in him to
[1:02:29] you it's for you it's not for somebody
[1:02:34] yes sir
[1:02:36] some preachers as preachers oh they
[1:02:39] think
[1:02:40] when a woman oh don't paint your lips
[1:02:43] don't paint your knees don't paint this
[1:02:45] don't do this don't legalistics let me
[1:02:48] tell when the true word is preached you
[1:02:51] don't need to go tell a woman should
[1:02:52] wear long skirt you don't need to tell a
[1:02:55] woman to take her lipsticks you don't
[1:02:58] need to tell a man not to wear shorts
[1:03:01] you don't need to tell the man don't
[1:03:03] commit adultery or the woman don't
[1:03:05] commit adultery as soon as the power of
[1:03:07] God fell upon that seed that seed will
[1:03:11] will begin to push herself
[1:03:14] away from the acquaintance the unclean
[1:03:18] things that seed will begin to come
[1:03:21] alive
[1:03:23] and made manifest
[1:03:25] because why the seed of God
[1:03:28] is Christ himself hidden there you have
[1:03:32] a seed of God in you recognize
[1:03:36] that it is you the Lord came and share
[1:03:40] his blood for you
[1:03:42] if you make mistake
[1:03:44] red paint 10 around
[1:03:47] the blood is there the spirit of God is
[1:03:50] there to forgive you
[1:03:52] so that you will be white as snow and
[1:03:55] walk with Christ
[1:03:57] the grace is there
[1:03:59] the grace is not for the serpents
[1:04:02] children
[1:04:03] the grace is for you
[1:04:05] he says my grace I give it unto you not
[1:04:09] as the world give the peace you give it
[1:04:12] to who you the world can give us peace
[1:04:15] there's no peace in the world they want
[1:04:17] to give us depression oppression God has
[1:04:21] created this world for us full abundance
[1:04:24] and yet they come and tell you oh you
[1:04:27] see the stock market now we go into
[1:04:29] recession we're going to walk who
[1:04:32] created anything tell me who
[1:04:34] what he has got lost in the world
[1:04:37] since God created have you seen God
[1:04:39] taking anything no everything is here
[1:04:42] it's just a serpent hiding in his
[1:04:45] children putting
[1:04:48] tries problems upon God's children
[1:04:51] that's why God by his grace
[1:04:55] as the signs increase
[1:04:57] God increases Spirit come out reveal
[1:05:01] himself more and more to us and tell us
[1:05:05] children have faith in me
[1:05:07] have confidence in me
[1:05:10] I am he
[1:05:11] the one that created this universe
[1:05:14] I have the knowledge that the world
[1:05:17] don't have I have all Treasures of the
[1:05:20] world that the world don't have if you
[1:05:23] obey me I will make a way when there's
[1:05:27] no way I'll make a way for you wonder
[1:05:30] small way because I'm taking you out
[1:05:33] from this world
[1:05:35] you don't belong to this world the world
[1:05:38] is in Sodom the church world is in Sodom
[1:05:42] but you are not in southern
[1:05:44] I can't hide what I wanted to do to the
[1:05:47] sodomize
[1:05:48] for my sin
[1:05:51] typing Abraham and Abraham see
[1:05:55] the Royal seed and it's you
[1:05:58] today the Royal Sea

[1:08:10] says okay sleep a little bit this is a
[1:08:12] little bit die a little bit I said honey
[1:08:14] let me tell you I know it's the devil I
[1:08:17] don't care I'm going to service once
[1:08:19] it's not cold or dark I'm going that
[1:08:23] pain have to get away I'm going to
[1:08:26] service and I came here and let me tell
[1:08:28] you
[1:08:29] I was telling brother Mike Daddy
[1:08:31] we talk we Rejoice I come here that's I
[1:08:35] saw the spirit of God even sometimes you
[1:08:37] don't know I'm shouting I'm praising God
[1:08:39] you don't know
[1:08:41] is the spirit of God because I fight my
[1:08:44] way to get into the presence of God and
[1:08:48] that's the way a True Believer you must
[1:08:50] be
[1:08:51] fight your way to get into the presence
[1:08:54] of God
[1:08:56] look at Russia and Ukraine
[1:08:59] Ukraine can't stand Russia but no matter
[1:09:03] what they're gonna let them fail the
[1:09:06] fight
[1:09:07] some of them are going even from Canada
[1:09:09] or us while they are Ukraine they're
[1:09:12] going they're going to fight
[1:09:17] they won't let him get it easy you
[1:09:21] understand a True Believer of Christ in
[1:09:24] here Satan won't leave you alone
[1:09:27] Satan not gonna let us go easy
[1:09:31] he gonna fight
[1:09:33] but we have to fight so if you fear
[1:09:36] fight
[1:09:36] you cannot go in
[1:09:39] anybody that is lukewarm can go in
[1:09:42] okay when you are lukewarm you can never
[1:09:45] go in but when you have the soul of the
[1:09:49] Lord like Caleb like Joshua
[1:09:53] yes sir then you are ready to charge
[1:09:57] the enemy know that you know that you
[1:10:01] are not going to give up what like David
[1:10:04] would Goliath five Stones he gonna kill
[1:10:07] Goliath no matter how strong Goliath is
[1:10:11] that God in David gonna kill Goliath and
[1:10:15] this hour that God in the wife of Christ
[1:10:19] will destroy Satan
[1:10:21] because it's prophesy already in the
[1:10:24] scriptures
[1:10:25] the seed of the woman shall bruise the
[1:10:29] serpent head and he will bruise his hair
[1:10:32] Christ Brews his head the bride was in
[1:10:35] where Christ once he brought the serpent
[1:10:38] head we bruise his head so it is your
[1:10:42] take rise up as soldiers of the Lord and
[1:10:47] charge as Caleb and Joshua and defeat
[1:10:51] the enemy
[1:10:54] overcome you you are more than that
[1:10:58] blessed be the name of the Lord our
[1:11:01] pastor never gave up
[1:11:03] Pastor Simon I see him going to Ghana
[1:11:07] with him
[1:11:09] see how the places we went the cow was
[1:11:12] going passing even in the day she still
[1:11:15] going to preach and I'm sitting down
[1:11:18] there that was very encouraging to me
[1:11:21] that's the time even I saw the spirit of
[1:11:24] God moved Pastor was able to interpret
[1:11:28] my language people were shocked how he
[1:11:32] was interpreting my language they asked
[1:11:34] me does he speak my language I says no
[1:11:37] and they saw it they saw God coming up
[1:11:40] if you're not paying the price you're
[1:11:43] not going to see those things but when
[1:11:45] you pay that price God is obligated to
[1:11:48] flow God is obligated to show you signs
[1:11:51] and wonders a lot of people think
[1:11:53] silence and wonders come by easy way it
[1:11:57] doesn't God word is doesn't come by easy
[1:12:01] way he can buy a hard way because God
[1:12:04] and Satan is fighting but God is in you
[1:12:07] so think if God is in you you are a
[1:12:12] soldier fighting Satan whose side did
[1:12:16] used to before the foundations of the
[1:12:18] world
[1:12:19] when up there the fight broke Lucifer
[1:12:22] and Michael
[1:12:24] did you stood for Michael
[1:12:26] or did you stood for Satan Lucifer we
[1:12:30] are down here I stood for Christ I'm
[1:12:34] going to fight dead or no dead until
