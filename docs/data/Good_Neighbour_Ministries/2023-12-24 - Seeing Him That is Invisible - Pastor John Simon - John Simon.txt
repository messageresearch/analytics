today uh please be seated for a moment I want to thank God others are out of town they've gone to be with their families or they're traveling at this particular time and for those who are online uh watching at this uh broadcast at this time may the Lord bless you real good and may the Lord bless us all who are gathered here today under the inspiration of the word of God for this day and for this hour thank you so much uh very much for your uh praise and worship and glory be to God Amen God is good isn't he amen uh we want to look to Hebrews chapter 11 we're not going to keep you uh long but we at least want to bring the word of God to you and point your thoughts your minds and your hearts back to the word because as you know we are not here um as part of the systems that are out there in the world uh which is caught up with this fiction uh that is called uh modern Christmas now we know that there is a Christmas in the sense that Christ was born but this that we see outside with the commercialism the the tinsil the the uh green trees and stuff like that it's all Pagan worship right it's all Pagan worship we're not teaching on that now but you read Jeremiah where he say they cut a tree and they they they fix it on another piece of wood and they keep it and dress it up with all kinds of tensil and shiny stuff like that and they worship it as a God because you see when all the other trees died the pine trees remain green right so they start worshiping it as a God and it's come down until this time until it's become a tradition um people are doing it but they don't know why they're doing it now don't think I'm here uh preaching against Christmas trees um uh as such I'm just letting you know the truth of it and you decide what you want to do if you want to have a Christmas tree up nobody's going to condemn you or tell you anything because it's just the tree right but make sure that you let your children know that that's just a tradition that's not the word of God is that right just as much as uh uh St Nicholas that that's not in the Bible it's not scripture it's it's a Fiction made up of this St Nicholas who can see everything you're doing everywhere know everything you want everywhere and he's everywhere at every time and it's nothing but reverse the name Satan St Nicholas Santa just just just turn the word around and you see Satan hiding behind that and um he's telling you right now he's trying to get his claws in you right um so so you got to be spiritual and recognize what is happening because he does these things and he stays behind the scene and he's literally laughing at the people and mocking at them because they don't recognize he is back there doing his evil works that he normally does but thank God that we have a people called out by a prophetic message amen that have recognize the day and the hour that we're living in we are no more under rituals we no more under traditions we are not under religious systems we're under the preeminence of rulership and headship of the word of God is that right we are led by God's word I know when we speak like this people on the outside of the Tabernacle of the tent they don't know what you're talking about and we are also Christians we are also go to church right now our church is fill it's more full than your church and stuff like that you know but that's not the point amen broad is the way but you see we understand Jesus said that just few there be that will find that narrow way may God help every one of us to keep our eyes on the prize and upon the word of God as we go to our subject in Hebrews 11: 24- 27 Hebrews chapter 11 24- 27 and let us read without uh delay praise God oh my uh by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter he recognize who he was uh choosing rather than to suffer I'm going to preach if I take every verse so I stop I just going to read choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible and that's what I want to talk about here today seeing him that is invisible amen our gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the reading of your word now we ask that the angel that troubled the waters back there and heal that sick man may you heal our sin sick Souls may you trouble the Waters of the word of God and Father we will give you glory and praise and we will not hesitate but to step into the anointing will step into the pool of your spirit and may you take the glory the honor and the praise in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen praise the Lord God bless you you know there's a poem that says who has seen the wind I think brother Desmond on Wednesday night was alluding to that and I said who has seen the wind uh but we have not seen the wind but we know that when the leaves are moving that the wind is passing by that's what David was saying he says when he sees the mulberry bushes moving I I'll know that that that you're passing by amen so when God begins to move and his Spirit comes into the church we know and we recognize him now when we read our scripture it tells us that Moses endured uh Pharaoh's wrath his anger uh he endured it and he had the power to endure using Brother brenham's message I I'm not quoting from that but I'm using the the topic to let you know what I'm talking about uh that he persevered he endured regardless of how angry Pharaoh was he had no fear for Pharaoh amen he had lost all the fear for Pharaoh because he had seen the face of the invisible King and seeing the invisible he was not worried about the visible because all things visible comes from the invisible Hallelujah he is the creator he is the originat he is everything of everything and so if I can come under his guidance his leadership his kingship no other king no other ruler no other power can can be of such a stature in front of my eyes that I would not obey him so Moses did not even fear uh Pharaoh anymore you see when you begin to get a vision and see him that is invisible you start to lose the fear of man you start losing the fear of great titles and great names and great authorities you respect them but you have lost your fear of all those things because you come on the invisible Kingdom of the resurrected Christ that's what we are here for today praise God anointed by the Holy Spirit to keep our eyes seeing him that is invisible hallelujah amen Lord Jesus said when you see me you have seen the father when you see me the visible me you are looking at the invisible father that indwells me praise God when you see the word hallelujah that is as the outward part but when you recognize what you're looking at you're beginning to see the father father that's in the word back of that word you're seeing invisible God hallelujah amen and that gives us the power to endure doesn't matter what problems no matter what trouble whatever trial what sickness whatever Satan puts upon you you can come through it all why you're seeing him that is invisible Hallelujah keep your eyes on him that is invisible Hallelujah yes sir praise God hallelujah yes sir so I'm saying if you can see and understand this revealed word of this hour you are looking at the father amen you are seeing the father not with your visible eyes but you are seeing him through Revelation by the eyes of the Soul amen oh praise God we sing the songs but do we really think Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord I want to see you I want to see you to see you high and lifted up oh praise God don't you want to see him high and lifted up oh yes may God Open the Eyes of My Heart on this uh this day that we are celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ into flesh amen you see all comes into view what condescension coming down from the invisible to become visible so we can understand him and then he can go back to the visible and we don't care whether we see him with our physical eyes but we recognize him within our heart the invisible God hallelujah amen yes sir praise God isn't it written in the scriptures where Jesus said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God it's only when I looked at this scripture and begin to understand what it means what he was really saying blessed are they who have that seed in them that can't sin blessed are the pure in heart for they the ones that will see God they will recognize him the invisible King made himself in a visible a a visible body so that we could understand and recognize him and know who he was praise the Lord thank God for the seed that is within your life for the seed of God cannot s amen you say oh I'm not I'm not perfect I'm not pure yes it's this man outside here but the man inside blessed are they pure in heart I said you're pure in heart I don't care what you done what you done in the past what You' done yesterday the Bible says the Lord God says you're pure in heart because his life his seed is within you and it cannot sin but you are kept not by yourself or by your you're kept by the power of God through faith you're kept by the power of God through faith hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord God I praise God and give God the glory for his wonderful works praise the Lord amen just take a little walk with me and let's go down the road a little while not here but back over there back in the east back in J Around Judea amen hallelujah and while we walk if we look in the crowds the jostling crowds because at this time of the year in Jerusalem and in Juda the people with their garments on are rushing back and forth as they're preparing to roast Lambs or whatever like that and as we walk we we see a man preaching and he's preaching by the side of the way and when we see him preaching we want to stop to hear what he is saying amen yes sir some stop to hear him like it is today some will stop to hear and some will just pass by you give them a track you give them a book they'll take it and throw it in the dumpster some will hold it and will read it when they get home but uh you see the times have changed the buildings the clothing but the sensual man has not change he's the same if at 10,000 years pass he's still the same still born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies and accept for the grace of God God by a life that he placed in us we had no hope but by him in our lives we have hope in Jesus Christ there is no other hope but the hope we have in Christ amen praise God hallelujah amen yes sir oh praise God and here is this man preaching and I tell you if that man was a lawyer he would be successful because he was preaching speaking boldly telling of the word of God thus sayeth the Lord amen yes sir that man might have been a a great doctor and maybe he'll make millions of dollars and I just thought I'd ask him who he was said sir you're preaching like we saw in Ghana we saw people preaching by the side of the road sir what is your name and he said well uh my name is Isaiah my name is Isaiah well Isaiah what are you doing Isaiah what why you here out in the street preaching why not go up in one of the churches or in the temple he said well I'd rather be out here preaching to the people so the people can hear me what it is that I have to say uh well well Isaiah you're doing a good job but it don't look like the people appreciate you because because some are walking away others don't want to hear what you have to say they don't seem to appreciate you but Isaiah said sir you don't understand uh real Servants of God I'm not here preaching to be appreciated I'm here preaching to bring forth the word of God whatever it might do or whatever it has to do I'm just here to speak it I'm here to preach it amen not to be appreciated lifted up and counted worthy but I'm here to do the will of the Living God and I hope every one of us here is here for that purpose and I hope you live your life in that way to please God and not to please your neighbor not to please Mrs Jones and Mr Jones Next Door whatever they are doing that's their Affairs but you keep you your life in line with the word of the Living God Amen praise God forever more amen well Isaiah you not normal uh how you acting is not normal Isaiah said well I can understand what you're saying but when I tell you that one day I went to the Tabernacle and I was there in prayer and when I was there in prayer I saw them cherub bims and Sims I saw them in the temple I saw the Lord sitting on the Throne I saw him high and lifted up Hallelujah the Holiness struck my soul I couldn't take it I said who is me oh I am undone My Flesh can't take it amen Oh my he was like that voice is me I am undone he said I Heard a Voice said who will go who will go for us whom shall I send and who will go oh my that's voice is crying out again today who will go who will I send who will obey the voice of God who will hear the word of God for this day and for this hour amen if you seen the word if you seen the Revelation really in its fullness you will begin to say like Isaiah who is me Lord who is me father my eyes have seen the glory of the living God and I walk with him alone amen yes sir amen praise God hallelujah and while when that was happening one of those angels went and took a a tongue and picked up a call from off the the great chandel the great sensor that they had there and took it from The Altar and brought it right and placed it on my tongue amen which means he had to open his mouth praise God and we got to open our mouths is I right I said we come to church we got to open our mouths if we want to get blessed we got to open our mouth it means we got to praise God we got to give God the glory and we got to honor him amen he placed that call on my tongue set my tongue on fire oh my that I couldn't help preaching everywhere I went I couldn't help talking about him I couldn't talk anything else about but Jehovah because the fire was on my tongue if you don't have that fire hope that fire comes upon your tongue here this morning hope the fires of God comes upon your tongue take away all our normaly take away all self and all carnality amen hallelujah and make you see speak the word hallelujah praise God because the fire of God is on your lips Isaiah said that fire is on my lips and it's because I am seeing him that is invisible I trust when you see him like Isaiah did it will set your soul on fire amen praise the name of the Lord let's walk a little further let's go up the road would you like to go with me let's walk a little further on we go further on and there's a there are great crowds of people they have come down to see a burning uh you say a burning yes the King Nebuchadnezzar gave an order to burn three of them Hebrew boys burn them in a fire and there the crowds gather and they're looking towards uh the oven where where the fire is burning each one of them in there you know their names Shadrach mishak and Abednego they're in that furnace with the fires living up and burning around them and I I made sure I pushed through the crowds and I got close enough that I can shout to them there and say you you guys uh how come you're you're now being pushed into this fire uh Wen you chosen to be leaders great men of earth great men in Israel Great Men even here in Babylon at such a young age oh my let me tell you friends doesn't matter how young you are God calls you God wants to use you God wants to lift you up the devil is going to come and give you an offer from within the world and tell you they can make you president of this and president of that Bishop of this and Bishop of that and give you the biggest offers to seduce your mind and your heart and to lure you if you are not fully aware of what God is doing nothing is wrong naturally if you haven't got a call towards Ministry and towards ministering the word of God nothing wrong with that aspiring to such Heights amen but these young men called by God amen here they were finding themselves instead of the cushy nice position of real Servants of God that are princes of the church they find themselves in a burning furnace of fire and I was asking them why are you there when you should have been leaders among the people amen yes sir well we we just uh found that uh we just refused to pray prayer is very important in our life amen and the devil really don't want you to really pray to God he wants you to pray to the wrong things they refus to pray and bow down before a a statue of the Prophet Danielle you said where you get that it's not in the Bible brother brandham said that's what it was Daniel was so spiritual and so anointed that the people go and make the king made a statue of Daniel and wanted the people to start bowing down to the Statue amen just like we are here today there's a lot of people want us to bow down to not a physical statue but to the idol of brother William Marian brandham and we don't want to we are not here to bow down to any screen Idol or we don't want to bow down to any other form of gal Idol or religious Idol we are not here for that purpose we are here to worship the invisible King eyes have not seen ears have not heard what God has restored has in store for them that truly love him amen blessed be the name of the Lord God hallelujah amen yes uh we refuse to pray amen oh we don't we the king tell us we refuse oh and I suddenly tell him HH be careful because here he comes now the king is coming oh my God here comes Nebuchadnezzar but Nebuchadnezzar looks to towards the fire amen he said I thought you Fells were born to a chrisp already from the time you leave this magnificent Cathedral this beautiful church that you were a member of you were a wonderful preacher teacher or Sunday school teacher you had a wonderful future in front of you you left all of that and you went out there getting mixed up in this message stuff and getting caught up with message of a prophet Isaiah Moses and all these other ones you get caught up with all of that I felt your whole life would have been bur up to Christmas amen and the devil thinks the same thing about you too my but watch but but wait a minute H there's a how come I'm seeing a fourth man in the fire with you who is that forth man what he doing in the fire oh my oh King they said left forever but the extra one you're seeing in the fire is him who is invisible the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace amen we are seeing him that is invisible thank God in this last day God has opened our eyes that we might see him that is invisible within the word of God by Revelation amen I don't see him with my natural eyes sometimes I do when he's passing by praise God I see little incidents little actions little things happenings with my natural eyes but every day every moment of the day I see him with the eyes of the Soul thank God Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord oh praise praise God I give God all the glory amen praise God hallelujah I tell you it's wonderful isn't it wonderful to serve the true and the Living God hallelujah amen I'll tell you friends the shepherd saw him you believe that because remember invisible condescension down into the form of a baby so that he might become VIs ible for a brief period until people can understand him and his nature and his character then he can go back to being invisible again amen so when the Shepherds came they got a revelation that he was coming down he was coming that he's here amen praise God hallelujah see I was corrected right there by the time the Shepherds knew he was already here praise the Lord praise God by the time we get the Revelation he's already here praise God oh my glory is how wonderful he's here praise God you believe it he's here by the time the wise men started traveling Amen brother brandham said it when they saw that star that star was a sign to them that Messiah was on earth now the Messiah is on the Earth right now do you believe it do you believe it the Messiah is on the earth now by the time they got there he was ready young child the word that started to grow and to mature praise the Lord hallelujah amen yes sir I tell you friends how wonderful it is to know that that God is the same God of yesterday today and forever amen Anna blind Anna back in the temple she had read the scriptures prayed sought God her physical eyes were blinded she couldn't see physical things but she had spiritual sight more than other people can ever dream to think about back in the temple the prophet said she heard the voice says Rise Up go out amen yes sir and she started shuffling going forward another part of the temple where the men are yeah Simeon hears the voice of God saying go forth and he goes there and sees the child in the mother's arms Hallelujah oh praise God at the same time he says Anna what are you doing here she says because I was inspired the same way you were inspired Hallelujah do you believe them sisters can be inspired like you are inspired I ask a question do you believe the sisters can be in inspired like you are amen they can be inspired it's just they're not called to preach but they can be inspired just as you are inspired Hallelujah sometimes they'll tell you some things that will inspire you praise the Lord maybe even give you a topic to preach on you might want to say it but sometimes things come out of their mouths that will inspire you praise the name of the Lord you got to recognize they part of you the part of the ministry they're part of the work of the Living God hallelujah amen yes sir let me tell you so s Simon said Anna you're here I'm glad you're here oh my he walks up and when he sees the Revelation the word was revealed the mother took the you know he was patted up she took that off so they can see the Christ he says oh Lord now let thy servant depart in peace my eyes have seen the invisible King my eyes have seen the glory of God I've caught a revelation amen I seen what the prophets was talking about I seen what Isaiah was talking about I seen what Moses was talking about I seen what Malachi 4:5 was talking about I recognize him praise God hallelujah amen yes sir oh my my eyes are seen the glory of God it's Christmas I said this is Christmas praise God this is not the tradition but this is the word of God the word of God is being born again here right now so that you can recognize him a man named Paul was going down the road one day riding down to take the lives of some of those uh Christian so-called Christians well learned a doctor of divinity a man of letters he no one could stand in front of him he knew how to place that law back and forth give you article and point you to page and give you knew the year and everything else he knew every quot from those prophets he could tell you what them old prophets says he could tell you praise God and there's a lot of people like that in this message now they can tell you all of that brother sister they said I'm out of denomination but denomination isn't out of them and and they still have the same spirit amen they take you they can cut you to pieces with all those quotes in it and Paul thought he had the same thing he was writing on down in the hot sun going down to Damascus and he was going to take the lives of them Christians but while he was going down he gave himself his own testimony to King Agrippa he said oh King oh he says I was riding and there a light appeared brighter than the midday Sun oh my Hallelujah and it Blinded Me struck me off my horse I fell to the ground I said who art thou Lord and a voice answered and said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest amen oh my my my glory to God and the Holy Spirit my friends led him where you know he was prayed for and his eyes open you say Paul what happened to you back there he says you don't understand I was blinded but I was still on the inside with my soul I was seeing him that is invisible seeing him that is invisible I trust every one of us leave here today and every other day realizing when you read the word and it starts to unveil itself you are seeing him that is invisible when you go to those quotations when you listen to the tapes when you hear the preaching and the word starts to express itself and manifest and break before you and in your heart you are seeing him that is invisible praise the name of the Lord blessed be the name of our great and invisible King praise God hallelujah amen praise God God is good isn't he hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen oh my yes sir I tell you he's a wonderful Mighty God Amen I I I I I'm thinking of a young man and I don't have his name here but I'm thinking of him how he might have been preaching preaching in the streets and while he's preaching they tell him the same thing they told Isaiah the people don't appreciate you but and in the first place you should not be preaching cuz you're just a deacon you're just a deacon what are you doing getting up there on the pulpit saying that you're preaching he says yeah but I'm a preaching Deacon thank God for those preaching deacons I said thank God for those preaching Deacons oh praise God and he was preaching the word of God and while he was preaching there somebody took a brick and threw it at him praise the Lord you know in some societies it's not quite as nice like here we get up on a nice pulpit in a nice Church like this you got to be out there and you are constantly in battle because you are in the streets you are preaching and whiskey bottles rum bottles are going past your head bricks are going by if people don't like it they express it they they physically express it amen and you you you got to stand with the word of God and withstand those Devils amen and no doubt that's what Steven was facing and the bricks began to hit him beat him bloody him and when they looked at him instead of him being scared and wanting to run he had a smile on his face Oh my he fell on the ground I ran over I picked him up and picked his head up he was still smiling I said Stephen you're dying you're dying why are you smiling he says I'm smiling because I see Jesus standing oh come on Steven something is wrong with you maybe when they hit your head you we know all the scriptures tell us that Jesus is sitting and now you coming with a different message telling us he's standing something is wrong with you that you are saying that Oh my he said yeah because I'm seeing him now I'm seeing him standing with his arms open to welcome me home praise be to God hallelujah I'm seeing him that is invisible oh praise God forever more yes sir Brothers we may have to go through a lot of things you get called all kinds of names we got bear the reproach for the word regardless of what it is we know our eyes are looking to the Unseen of course you know I read that message as a backgrounding too before preaching on this I'm looking at the Unseen amen my eyes are on the invisible the Unseen and I'm walking towards that and if you can see that thing that is in your heart brother brandham said even if it's sickness whatever it is if you can see it and you can keep your heart your thoughts on it and believe and keep walking towards it one day you'll walk right into it oh praise be to God forever more oh I'm thinking about heaven I'm thinking about home I'm thinking about Jesus and I keep my eyes on him and one day I'll walk right into it amen glory be to God hallelujah amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah amen praise God Amen he's wonderful isn't he amen my my my oh my Moses what about you he read the scriptures about you what about you you were a upcoming man you were I mean Pharaoh's daughter's uh son no no no no no no I was not her son that was revealed to me amen that I wasn't our son I knew who I was and where I came from and right there it started when I began to recognize who I am amen oh my but yes Moses you used to live in Pharaoh's Palace amen praise God many of us here was in high positions of lots of money and lots of friends and uh lots of uh you know areas social areas we could go into and expand our influence and expand our fortune and stuff like that amen praise God but but what are you doing here uh Moses with a stick in your hand you love hiking you hiking through the desert what what you doing here Moses to see you here doing this type of thing what happened I'm not welcoming the palace anymore you supposed to be Pharaoh's son and you're not welcome in the palace yeah you were once the devil's son but once you get this revelation of this word of who you are you're not welcome anymore in his Palace he don't want nothing to do with you anymore he throw you out matter of fact he wants your life now he wants to come after you and come to your life well you know I I kill an Egyptian there and when I killed an Egyptian I was scared of the king I I I feared The King and I had to uh come down here to Midian and to look after some sheep and and you know while I was there with those sheep one day all of a sudden a flame of fire burst in one of those bushes and when I saw the fire in those bushes it attract my attention and so I I wanted to know what is this all about how could that happen but out of the pillar of fire there came a voice amen you've seen it amen Moses Moses amen oh my who art thou Lord and you know the convers ation and and with putting his hands in his bosom and taking it out but it comes to the point where God says I am sending you down there to Pharaoh right I'm sending you down there to pharaoh and you go down there and tell him let my people go you're going to set two million people go just by your word that you're going to speak but Lord who am I he's still under the first Spirit he was under of the flesh when he fled from Pharaoh amen he said but but I I I can't talk God says I sending you I who who who owns your mouth who who who controls everything I'm the one that doing it you go in my name who shall I say send me tell him I am that I am Amen in other words Moses was to go and tell Pharaoh I am that I am and it was I am in him speaking through him at that point amen of course he wasn't aware of that but praise God hallelujah but to pick up brother bradam he says think of it praise the Lord think of it an old man with a long beard he you couldn't make out the difference from the lent of hair on his head to the hair on his chest to the hair on his beard it's all merged together being in that Wilderness with that St with his wife seapora and two kids and then he meets God in the burning bush and he it set a soul of fire the prophet said he got his old donkey got his wife amen uh he used the word mule then later on he said donkey so I'll use both so that you choose whichever one you want but he said he took his wife and put her on that mule back of him and he get on that mule amen he says and Zapora had two children one on the right and one child on the left amen praise God hallelujah message of the Cross anyway and here he was riding down going to do what Moses where are you going I'm going down to Egypt what do you think you're going to do there they're looking for you down there he says I'm going to take over Hallelujah brother BR said you are you crazy Moses he says no he says I seen the burning bush I've seen him that is invisible and I'm going to take over Egypt in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah oh praise God hallelujah take over in the name of Jehovah because his eyes have seen the Unseen he recognize and seen the face of the invisible amen praise God forever more for yes sir how could I be disobedient to that heavenly vision that I seen how could I do it he can't do it because he recognize him that is invisible I'm so thankful to God he's the same yesterday today and forever and that he cannot change and he cannot lie amen praise the Lord oh praise God let me just make one uh comment one more I want to talk about John the Revelator is that okay John the Revelation amen

what is the population here he says one amen BR let me tell you something one man in the hands of God Is Enough one woman under the influence of the holy spirit is enough one believer Anointed with the Holy Spirit one chase a thousand and two will chase 10,000 amen praise God hallelujah he says oh just a population of one and that's all God wants amen God doesn't take two by two or three by three you personally individually must believe his word and to see him that is invisible hallelujah praise God hallelujah well John you must have misunderstood my question I'm asking you actually how many people are living on this island and he says no you misunderstand me I'm telling you I'm the only one living on this island amen hallelujah well John you have all my love all my appreciation and

blessed be the name of the Lord oh well John I think you're up in years now John you must be hallucinating you start getting some strange messages you're preaching something must be wrong with your your mind John either something you eat or something of the other John must have turned to them and said no no no no don't worry about me don't worry about me at all because I'm telling you I've been here for several years and I can't help it I can only see him that is invisible my eyes are upon him that is invisible and I want to encourage you keep your eyes on him that is invisible don't let the devil Fascinate You charm you seduce you by these things of the visible that are in front of you oh my but keep your eyes upon him and look away to the Lord Jesus Christ that you might see him and see him alone him that is invisible praise the name of the Lord amen amen praise God what are you going to say now Isaiah gave up prominence and wel to preach an unpopular message Isaiah was a friend of the king and he was in and out of the palace uzziah's Palace every day and you know what God did about that because he wants Isaiah's eyes on him is that right praise the Lord and Isaiah walked away from prominance and privilege walked away from all those things that he might catch the vision and keep his eyes on him that is invisible and then go out and preach an unpopular message under the behalf of him that is invisible that's what we called to do here today to go out and preach an unpopular message that some of the people can't even see what you're talking about and those that who have a little glimmer they might listen a little bit and then afterwards when it's too much they can't take it anymore they'll walk right away amen but we have to keep going you don't stop you keep going doesn't matter who doesn't believe it who want to walk away from it we want to stand upon the word of the Living God amen hallelujah thank God we have some Isaiah still do you believe we have some Isaiah still amen praise the name of the Lord a preacher called me uh spoke to me yesterday and he said you know oh thank God we still have a real genuine five-fold Ministry he said man that brother Aubrey went to a certain place and preached a message there he said when he finished preaching this is not brother Aubrey telling me this is another preacher called me to tell me that the the the people were so blessed the preacher was so anointed he come and giv giving brother Aubrey the keys for the church says brother auy I can't preach take take take the keys take take all the people you this is your church now brother ABY said no brother give him back the keys it's not my church God only bring me here to preach the word and I'm just passing through you you are the shepherd here to keep the flock in line and walked away from it I'm saying that just to let you know there are still men of God really genuinely anointed by the Holy Ghost for his purpose for his plan Amen to keep your eyes on him that is invisible hallelujah amen we will be called to preach on popular message amen they're not going to want to pay you give you any money they're not going to want to support your ministry they're not want going to mention your name because it will taint them it will put smoke on them it will put some kind of smell on them they want nothing to do with you when you start to preach that message by a revelation it becomes unpopular to them because they're not seeing what you're seeing and they have no sense instead of just shut their mouth be quiet and wait and see how the thing will unfold they go blabbering and and talking like that but friends keep your eyes on him that is unvisible amen praise God I thank God there's lots of men like there's really fivefold Ministry and it's coming down is that right you know when you have a lot of stew in a pot you start to boil it you don't it don't end up with a pot full all of a sudden you see your sto going down it's going down it's going down it gets to a level it levels off and then you know you have the reals too with all the gravy and all oh man my some of you going to enjoy your Christmas holidays anyway you going to be slobbering with that gravy coming down all your chin and everything else you're just going to soap it with a piece of bread or something but anyway oh my friends let me let you know that this thank God for some is some real Spirit given not made up there's a lot of man-made soall calling themselves part of the fivefold ministry just because they are preaching that's not what it is no sir you don't even have to speak it of yourself the Holy Ghost himself will testify he will testify like he did to Abel he let he'll testify when you have it you don't have it amen doesn't matter what you say where you come from God will do that thank God I'm so glad also that there's still some Stevens in the church aren't you glad we have some preaching deacons I said aren't you glad you have some preaching deacons oh my amen and I'm saying not only are there preaching deacons men that refuse to play Church politics politics religious politics they're not into the church because oh I have to listen before I say that I was somewhere uh where um some people were doing certain business and one of the men because he was pretty rich and this and that was complaining because when they signed the documents his name wasn't on the top why you put my name on the bottom but as long as the document is legalized and certified it doesn't matter where your name is whatever the division of the prophets are that is what you're getting but he was still caught up with this personal thing of having his name on the top right but thank God there's God God has men in the church that not concerned with church politics is that right thank God we're not concerned with church politics amen oh this is the big one that's the one I oh this one cleans the the the the all he does is clean the floor oh this one here he's close to the pastor you know oh that other one she's this she's that no no no no we don't have church politics we are here with the word amen and the word makes us of all Nations one blood you heard what I said of all Nations one blood one blood of all Nations praise God you know during the last World War some of the German generals wounded some of them dying when they come to treat them they run out of blood and all they had was some Jewish people and they drew the blood from them they were willing to get the blood and when they come to the general and tell him well this is the only blood we have you know you will take a pig's blood you will take this Blood take that blood if we put it in you why don't you try a human blood even though you just said they Jews and some of them absolutely refused and they died they died they'd rather die than to take that blood and and a couple of them said yes I I'll take it at least you know I I'll take it amen and they took the Jewish blood and it wasn't blue black brown or some other color the it was just the same blood like your blood my blood everybody's blood what I said is right in the book of Acts God has made men of all nations of one blood amen the colors of their skin and their hair and this might be different and their Fashions might be different the cultural this but to God in his eyes he see them one amen praise the name of the Living God hallelujah yes sir I want you to know all that praise God so no church politics amen one in Christ amen hallelujah praise God when you see the carnality rise up in some people and they're still thinking a race oh brother Simon you shouldn't talk about such things that should be out in the no no no no no it's right in the Bible here amen and it's inside of the message where there a lot of people are caught up with race they're caught up with race IAL stuff and then talking about peace on Earth and Good Will towards men yeah and grace and the love of God let me tell you that the prophet said the genuine love will indeed be between the members of the Bride nowhere else it's going to be amen if you're a true child of God you're a true daughter of God a true son of the Living God then the love of God floods your heart amen hallelujah I see you I see your color I see your face you see mine but we looking past that we're looking at that spirit that Soul that's living back there that Gene that's living back there amen we know where it come from you know where it come from amen it's God behind a badger skin it's God be hiding behind skin God in his Temple glory to God glorifying himself by the great spirit of Christ amen hallelujah yes sir we don't go by Church politics we only go by the revelation of the word of God hallelujah amen Shadrach mishak and Abednego what made you so strong we seen the one that is invisible and we refuse to obey Men We rather to obey God we rather to believe God's word as the truth and the word of every other man a lie amen we stay with the word and the promise of this day and of this hour to you out there among the Nations hearing the word of God May the Holy Spirit speak directly to your heart and to your soul and recognize that we are all one in Christ Hallelujah break down every wall and every barrier Break Every Chain take off everything else and let us come before the Lord as one people I saw said I looked and I saw people of every Kingdom of every nation of every tribe every language and every town and there were all together raising holy hands saying hallelujah hosana hosana to him that sited upon the throne amen amen praise God that's what we are here for to bring glory and praise and honor to his great name amen yes sir praise God would you be like John who would be an outcast they tried to boil him in oil they couldn't even boil out that Jean out of him they couldn't burn it they couldn't boil it they couldn't do anything to get it out of him amen praise God they put him on a Lonely Island in other words he became an outcast are you willing to build reproached for the word and really become an outcast and I say sometimes you're Outcast the first people that you're Outcast

use love when to use patience Temperance and all these gifts of this uh fruits of the spirit of God but we are fearless that's why the apostles were Fearless because they're seeing him that is
