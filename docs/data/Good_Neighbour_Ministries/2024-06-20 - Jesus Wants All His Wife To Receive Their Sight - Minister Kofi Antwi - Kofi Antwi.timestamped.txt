[28:09] 2835 and it came to
[28:15] pass okay everybody is ready and it came
[28:18] to
[28:19] pass that as he was coming n onto
[28:24] Jericho a certain blind man said by the
[28:29] way side begging and hearing the
[28:34] multitude passing by he asked what it
[28:39] meant and they told him that Jesus of
[28:45] Nazareth passes by and he cried saying
[28:52] Jesus thou son of David have mercy on me
[28:58] and they which were before rebuke him
[29:03] that he should hold his peace but he
[29:08] cried so much there
[29:13] more thou son of David have mercy on me
[29:19] and Jesus
[29:21] stood
[29:23] and command him to be brought unto him
[29:29] and when he was come near he asked
[29:34] him
[29:36] saying what will thou that I shall do
[29:41] unto thee and he said
[29:45] Lord that I might receive my sight and
[29:51] Jesus said unto him receive thy sight
[29:57] thy faith had saved thee and immediately
[30:02] he receiv
[30:03] received his
[30:05] sight and follow him right Jesus didn't
[30:11] tell him follow

[30:22] amen even though he received his
[30:25] physically side it was spiritual
[30:30] side here tells me that his spiritual

[33:46] by it is
[33:48] Jesus that is passing
[33:52] by as soon as he heard that it is
[33:56] Jesus the Deep deep called to the deep
[33:59] in him rose
[34:01] up because even though he was physically
[34:06] blind the seed was laying
[34:09] down the seed need the word to open up
[34:13] to him and here was the word as soon as
[34:17] they says it is Jesus that seed just
[34:20] come up the seene
[34:24] am Jesus
[34:29] also is the
[34:32] one you can go to church message church
[34:36] for 30 years 40 years 20 years 10 years
[34:40] 5
[34:41] years by without
[34:45] Jesus passing by your way and you cry
[34:49] out to
[34:52] him if you are a seed that seed will be
[34:55] laying down there
[34:58] but when you cry out unto the Lord when
[35:00] you heard his voice and you cry out let
[35:04] me tell you he will open your spiritual
[35:07] eye and you will be a changed person
[35:11] nobody have to tell you to come to
[35:14] church nobody have to tell you to read
[35:16] brother Braham books I'm bringing it
[35:19] today come on no Pastor have to beg you
[35:23] Pastor Danny don't have to beg you to be
[35:25] in the house of the Lord because you not
[35:28] doing it for him because your eye has
[35:31] been
[35:32] open that is what happened to this man
[35:36] in the Bible Jesus was passing
[35:40] by and he had a True
[35:44] Believer he heard people
[35:47] crying some noise and he heard it
[35:50] spiritually so he called he need help he
[35:54] says who is passing by
[35:58] the True Believer told him oh here is
[36:00] Jesus says what
[36:03] Jesus Jesus I need my
[36:07] sight Lord I need my sight the people
[36:12] even the Believers tell him shut
[36:16] up shut your mouth you making too much
[36:20] noise but the man didn't care he need a
[36:25] sight because he was so Des
[36:28] he has sat down in his heart crippled
[36:31] inside even though the seed was there he
[36:35] was
[36:36] inside but through Jesus passing his way
[36:40] he says he never sees something like
[36:43] that in his life and I want to tell each
[36:45] and every one of you since you ever came
[36:49] to Good
[36:51] Neighbor have you ever seen something
[36:54] like this have you ever apart from you
[36:58] coming coming to contact Good Neighbor
[37:01] Ministry have you ever
[37:05] had the voice of God like this speak to
[37:09] you from Pastor Simon to Pastor Dany to
[37:13] desmon
[37:15] Philip Christopher timia even myself the
[37:20] least one have you heard the voice speak
[37:22] to you like this never a man speak like
[37:25] this man because Jesus Jus when he speak
[37:28] you have to
[37:31] act people don't know that's why you go
[37:34] in the message people are still in the
[37:37] message dragging their feet even they
[37:39] can go good message church but they are
[37:41] dragging their feet because why when
[37:44] Jesus is passing when Jesus is speaking
[37:48] they will open up their heart so that he
[37:50] could speak to them to open their blind
[37:53] spiritual Blind Eye for them to see the
[37:56] word of God
[37:59] making life in their
[38:02] life making way because when God come
[38:05] everything pushes
[38:08] out all fear all sorrow all pain will
[38:12] push
[38:15] out because Jesus is on the scene this
[38:19] is what happened to the blind mind and
[38:23] at this particular hour we know the
[38:25] whole world is in darkness
[38:28] and only the ones that have the
[38:31] light from starting from where the 54
[38:35] Ministry and going down to the
[38:38] congregation and the 5old ministry is
[38:40] the one that God is flowing through to
[38:44] feed the children of
[38:47] God a lot of people think you can read
[38:51] brother Braham message books you can
[38:54] listen to the tape and stay home and you
[38:57] are okay even some don't believe in
[39:00] listening to the a preacher but let me
[39:04] tell you you need a stor missing to take
[39:07] this Bible and take the prophet message
[39:10] to shape up your life yes sir and place
[39:14] you where you have to be in
[39:17] Christ then you are fit for the job call
[39:22] you to
[39:23] do
[39:25] otherwise my sister my brother mother
[39:28] you will be just walking like the blind
[39:31] mind even though you a seed of God you
[39:34] will be just like a blind mind wow
[39:37] Because Why without the five4 ministry
[39:41] because you need the word to preach in
[39:44] flesh come on without the word preach in
[39:47] flesh you can never receive God in
[39:51] spirit form in reality for your
[39:56] life for this hour thank you brother you
[39:59] have added it for this hour present
[40:02] stage of his ministry sir then he shape
[40:05] you clean you up then let me tell you it
[40:09] takes away the demon Spirits for this
[40:13] hour from your
[40:16] life so that you can do the job that
[40:19] Lord called you
[40:21] for and this is the challenge the people
[40:24] don't want the voice of God Al life for
[40:28] them for today in their life but they
[40:31] want brother Braham voice back there on
[40:35] the tape on the books oh he was a
[40:38] prophet that pill of fire was on his
[40:40] head don't you see that my brother my
[40:44] sister they can tell you ups and down
[40:47] but bring them that brother where do you
[40:52] Fellowship where are you
[40:54] fellowshipping if you believe brother AB
[40:56] Braham
[40:58] brother Abraham himself told us that we
[41:00] need five4 Ministry yes sir and it's in
[41:04] the
[41:05] Bible it's not something is making a up
[41:09] if you don't believe me believe brother
[41:11] Abraham and if you believe brother
[41:13] Abraham brother Abraham message lead you
[41:16] straight back to the Bible in the 54
[41:19] Ministry yes
[41:21] sir right it's right there teachers
[41:23] evangelist I don't want to mention it
[41:26] it's right in the
[41:28] Bible if you don't believe that let me
[41:31] tell you you are a
[41:34] sinner then you need
[41:37] God because the devil today believe
[41:39] brother Braham don't you know the devil
[41:42] don't believe what brother Braham preach
[41:45] the devil believe it and
[41:47] tremble but putting what brother Braham
[41:50] preached to
[41:54] action putting what brother Braham
[41:57] preached to action it was Christ in
[41:59] brother
[42:00] Abraham so that Christ is still
[42:04] speaking right watch this blind mind the
[42:10] Lord has opened his eye he could have
[42:11] says okay the Lord has open my I am
[42:14] going home hey whoe my eye is open
[42:17] that's it
[42:19] no he
[42:21] recognize he need
[42:23] Fellowship he recognized the word that
[42:26] he has open the word that has opened his
[42:28] eye is
[42:30] continuation and if he want to fully be
[42:34] free he have to follow the word on you
[42:37] have to walk with the word talk with the
[42:39] word receiving strength from the word
[42:42] yes sir and the more he walk with the
[42:44] Lord the more his eye were open and the
[42:47] more you since you came and contact Good
[42:50] Neighbor your eye has been open more and
[42:53] more some of us when we came here we
[42:56] didn't even know the Prophet we didn't

[1:05:51] yes he
[1:05:52] did and the Lord says come
[1:05:56] what do you want me to do for you the
[1:05:58] Lord even didn't heal him right there he
[1:06:02] he even put him to a question what do
[1:06:05] you
[1:06:06] want me to do for you
[1:06:10] on is not that his I just puffed
[1:06:15] off
[1:06:17] Lord I want to receive my
[1:06:22] sight
[1:06:24] so the Lord
[1:06:26] says receive thy sight thy faith has
[1:06:31] made thee
[1:06:34] whole the man I puffed
[1:06:37] up he didn't go home and cover himself
[1:06:41] or Rejoice or friends or outside party
[1:06:45] he followed that voice and I can tell
[1:06:49] you by the word of the Lord if your eye
[1:06:54] open you follow that word with all of
[1:06:59] your heartu with all of your mind with
[1:07:03] all of your soul yes Lord so that God
[1:07:06] will get glory in you when God sees like
[1:07:11] that all the
[1:07:15] healing all the
[1:07:18] gifts he can trust
[1:07:21] you and give it to
[1:07:24] you because why when he give it to you
[1:07:28] some of us we don't even want to come to
[1:07:30] church what about 3:00 you are sleeping
[1:07:33] and the Lord comes to you and says wake
[1:07:34] up go to this house so so and so so
[1:07:37] person is sick go pray for him then you
[1:07:40] you put a blanket and cover
[1:07:42] yourself because why you don't want to
[1:07:44] come to church and you want to see a
[1:07:47] miracle you can talk how much you want
[1:07:50] God won't give it to you but when you
[1:07:53] are serious
[1:07:56] when which father will give his
[1:07:59] inheritance to even a son or daughter
[1:08:02] that is not serious about his
[1:08:05] way unless you are serious when God
[1:08:08] opened that man eye let me tell you I
[1:08:14] believe continue reading the people
[1:08:16] start rejoicing because that man was
[1:08:18] what following the Lord working with the
[1:08:21] word so they see what the Lord Has Done
[1:08:24] says oh oh my
[1:08:26] God this man eye has open the word has
[1:08:30] opened to this man his natural eye open
[1:08:34] he can see everything so wow this is a
[1:08:39] wonderful thing is that not what the
[1:08:41] world is waiting
[1:08:43] for the world is waiting for that when
[1:08:47] the word has open to you spiritually you
[1:08:51] can open up the word to them the and you
[1:08:56] walking with Jesus let me tell you when
[1:08:58] I went to England and visit Pentecostal
[1:09:01] they give me something to talk not
[1:09:04] nothing about anything was when we were
[1:09:07] picking the their congregation members
[1:09:11] they pick me on a car some of them want
[1:09:13] the car to come and stand right on their
[1:09:15] door otherwise they not coming to church
[1:09:17] so when they give me opportunity to talk
[1:09:19] I talk I says if your eye has been open
[1:09:22] the driver don't have to come and wait
[1:09:24] you you will get into the house of the
[1:09:27] Lord do you know what the next time my
[1:09:29] brother was going to that church to do
[1:09:31] something my brother whom I go visit
[1:09:33] they told him even I didn't go there
[1:09:35] again even though his wly things this
[1:09:37] that they told my brother they said my
[1:09:40] God your brother if he's not a preacher
[1:09:43] he's so into the word of God
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:49] seriously God is my witness my brother
[1:09:51] came and told
[1:09:53] me okay
[1:09:56] that is what you want to
[1:09:59] be you want to even where you are
[1:10:01] passing by you're passing by in some
[1:10:04] areas because you have eat the word so
[1:10:08] much that the word not just you going to
[1:10:12] say repent and be baptized in Jesus name
[1:10:14] or come out from theom no no no no just
[1:10:19] leave your life go as our pastor has
[1:10:22] taught us let what God plac in your had
[1:10:26] that maybe you have seen lat you take
[1:10:29] wisdom and speak about that and just
[1:10:31] pass by God will do the rest
[1:10:35] right when my brother told me I was
[1:10:37] shocked about it and that is the
[1:10:42] way God want us to be when your eye is
[1:10:47] open don't stay back you can how can you
[1:10:52] stay back Jesus has visited you a
[1:10:58] sinner a rotting like a
[1:11:00] pck a Pok or pick and you will stay
[1:11:05] home no I
[1:11:08] can't not until my dead
[1:11:13] bed I said again some of you hear me not
[1:11:18] until brother kofy dead
[1:11:20] bed my eye is open I can't even if I
[1:11:25] close it it can't close it's
[1:11:28] open that blind mind eye he cannot close
[1:11:33] it again because the Lord has do what
[1:11:37] open the eye so all you have to do is to
[1:11:40] follow the lord all I have to do is to
[1:11:43] follow what the word in flesh and the
[1:11:47] word in flesh is what bringing it in the
[1:11:50] five4
