[25:17] to read down amen just a lot of the
[25:20] authority of God amen
[25:22] I don't might take a little twist a
[25:24] little turn maybe it will stir up your
[25:26] your understanding here how we
[25:29] understand things but what Christ gets
[25:33] inside of the life a matter we see
[25:36] something happens it's different right
[25:39] now Peter here Peter didn't pray for
[25:44] this man the unsold didn't ask God to
[25:47] heal him he said such as I have give I
[25:52] deem this is the maturity differently
[26:00] okay
[26:01] he's not saying here go crazy
[26:05] this is this is he he says all the time
[26:43] for you to speak you see here where you
[27:10] reckon actually work and your situation
[27:14] and the condition
[27:15] [Music]
[27:27] you know
[27:30] [Music]
[27:40] [Music]
[27:48] [Music]
[27:55] [Music]
[28:09] [Music]
[28:28] this 40 comes with that without maturity
[29:43] and she's under that authority amen
[29:49] we don't on the same verse 16 that was
[29:52] faked in the name of Jesus that broke
[29:55] this miracle in her didn't ask
[29:57] he'll defend he believed that the work
[29:59] already had done his part and have
[30:01] placed that power with inside of him
[30:05] sisters if you realize when you speak
[30:12] that word you believe that verb
[30:14] especially commissioned you is that in
[30:21] there you say after this mess stay there
[30:36] it was Peters responsibility to release
[30:39] that power and that's just what he did
[30:42] the Lord never told us to pray for the
[30:44] sick in the sense that we asked him to
[30:47] heal them he told us to heal the sick
[30:52] that's why there's a big difference
[30:56] between the two it has to do with the
[31:01] operation and the authority that he has
[31:04] already given us as when the bride is
[31:10] one of the word and the spirit of god is
[31:13] her revelation of what to do with the
[31:16] word the spirit moves like it did on
[31:19] Peter Peters heart and he took that
[31:22] authority and spoke the word of Jesus
[31:25] you see a lot of
[31:34] we have to rise to another level my
[31:36] brothers and sisters this denominational
[31:40] way of thinking is this immaturity us at

[44:16] so that were to return under control all
[44:21] that we can see you within us overcoming
[44:27] orders over or reading over King and
[44:30] unlimited needs or it's been always the
[44:35] same process down through time and it's
[44:37] no different in this day and age Lord
[44:39] and here we are there has become corrupt
[44:41] your Lord they're hot for the completion
[44:44] of equity that the compensate what the
