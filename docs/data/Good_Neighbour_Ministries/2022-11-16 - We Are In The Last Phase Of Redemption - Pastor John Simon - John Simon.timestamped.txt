[25:07] wonderful Ministry and it's a blessing
[25:11] to all of us I'm sure so we give God
[25:15] praise and honor and glory amen praise
[25:19] the Lord
[25:19] [Music]
[25:24] God bless you uh shall we turn in our
[25:28] Bibles to Luke 17
[25:32] verses uh 25 to 30.
[25:49] Jesus speaking
[25:54] but first must he suffer many things
[26:00] and be rejected of this generation
[26:05] and as it was in the days of Noah so
[26:09] shall it be also in the days of this son
[26:13] of man
[26:15] they did eat they drank they married
[26:18] wives they were given in marriage until
[26:21] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[26:25] and the flood came and destroyed them
[26:29] all
[26:30] likewise also as it was in the days of
[26:34] lot they did eat and they drank they
[26:37] bought they sold they planted they build
[26:42] it but in the same day that lot went out
[26:47] of Sodom
[26:49] the fire fell
[26:51] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[26:55] and destroyed them all
[26:59] even thus shall it be in the day when
[27:04] the son of man
[27:06] is revealed amen thanks be to God father
[27:10] we thank you for just reading of the
[27:13] word and we ask your blessing now in
[27:15] Jesus name amen God bless you please be
[27:18] seated of course you know we are living
[27:20] in a day of Revelation
[27:24] and uh
[27:26] when we are speaking uh the word what
[27:30] they are hearing is the written word
[27:33] and that is why they can reason it and
[27:35] they can compare and they can uh do all
[27:38] the types of analysis and uh dividing it
[27:42] and stuff like that nature but you see
[27:45] what is happening now is that the bride
[27:48] has become the word and she has become
[27:51] the voice of God to the age in which
[27:54] she's living
[27:55] therefore what is really happening is
[28:00] that
[28:01] um
[28:02] they their emphasis is on the written
[28:05] word uh which is true and it's right
[28:10] but the phase of which we are in now
[28:14] uh it's gone to a higher dimension
[28:18] and now uh we are in the seven Thunders
[28:23] you know what I'm talking about
[28:26] the the seven Thunders which is the
[28:29] revelation of the word
[28:32] see they come out of the word they are
[28:37] HID in the word but not written in the
[28:40] word it's some sort of strange and funny
[28:43] to say that but it's in the word and it
[28:47] is the word but God didn't allow it to
[28:49] be written in the word praise God that
[28:54] has got to be received by revelation
[28:58] amen and to have to receive that
[29:01] Revelation you have got to have a
[29:03] receptor in you
[29:05] and that receptor in you is not
[29:08] something you get last year when you
[29:10] repented at an altar what it was in you
[29:14] because you were born with Christ the
[29:18] Eternal seed of life within you as a
[29:21] believing son or daughter of the Living
[29:24] God
[29:25] Jesus said no man no woman can come unto
[29:29] me except the father calls him or her
[29:31] praise God you cannot come praise the
[29:34] Lord glory is marvelous wonderful name
[29:38] and I'm so glad to God for this uh
[29:42] wonderful face that he has given to us
[29:44] by the Holy Spirit of the Living God
[29:49] amen glory to God hallelujah now let's
[29:53] go and talk a little bit about the
[29:55] Pentecostals because last Sunday and uh
[29:58] for two or three Sundays we've been
[30:01] talking about separation and different
[30:03] stages of it
[30:06] and uh now we want to talk about
[30:09] continue to speak about it here now let
[30:12] me take the topic is we are in the last
[30:15] phase of redemption
[30:18] we are in the last phase of redemption
[30:21] now praise the Lord hallelujah oh my
[30:26] God now see uh brother Abraham is saying
[30:29] what the Pentecostal Church have to do
[30:32] it had to lay there it had to go to
[30:38] ground
[30:39] it had to die it has to rot
[30:44] oh my in order to bring forth that life
[30:49] again
[30:51] praise the Lord hallelujah now see he
[30:55] redeems the world the same way he
[30:57] redeems a man
[30:59] amen the man believes he's baptized he's
[31:03] cleansed by the blood Hallelujah then
[31:07] the Holy Ghost fire comes
[31:10] and it begins to take the world out of
[31:14] him
[31:15] see which that Spirit comes which is the
[31:19] word and what he's saying here that
[31:22] Spirit comes which is the word see God
[31:26] Redeeming the world the same way he says
[31:31] you know I spoke about that in the
[31:33] future home of the Heavenly bridegroom
[31:35] and the Earthly brain
[31:38] praise the Lord now let's go back now to
[31:42] see what he's saying now let's start out
[31:45] with the world was already condemned
[31:48] and it was condemned by the sin in the
[31:53] garden
[31:55] and Adam gave up the title deed and fell
[31:59] from the word
[32:02] he fell out of the word of God
[32:05] hallelujah now the preaching of Noah
[32:11] type the justification that we now
[32:15] receive from Jesus Christ
[32:18] because what happened the water the
[32:21] flood it just washed out the washed out
[32:25] sin and washed out evil but it left a
[32:28] lot of rotting corpses and stuff but it
[32:31] did its job by doing the washing
[32:35] then he then here he says the next thing
[32:39] he doesn't say that the way I said it I
[32:42] just want you to know that so that I'm
[32:45] just looking here seeing what he said I
[32:47] understand what he said and I'm just
[32:49] telling you praise the name of the Lord
[32:51] Jesus Hallelujah now see then you see
[32:56] for God use that to baptize the Earth
[33:00] with water right then his son came along
[33:05] and dropped his blood upon it my see
[33:10] water blood you see by that blood he was
[33:15] claiming it for his own he was claiming
[33:18] and sanctifying it and claiming it for
[33:21] his own then in the final wind up is the
[33:27] renovation by the fire
[33:31] Amen on this Earth will be burnt up with
[33:36] fire not destroyed not disappear you can
[33:40] annihilate it it's a spoken word of God
[33:43] but it will be burnt with fire amen and
[33:47] that fire he says I'm speaking of well
[33:51] born every germ out of the atmosphere in
[33:57] the uh Heavenly bright from an Earthly
[34:00] bright he said it will even burn up
[34:02] devils and evil spirits that infest an
[34:07] inhabit the upper atmospheres and it
[34:11] will destroy it it says this is not just
[34:14] a normal fire amen it's the fire the
[34:18] consuming fire of God hallelujah that
[34:21] can burn natural and Supernatural glory
[34:25] to God hallelujah amen so it will burn
[34:29] that out and after that what happens you
[34:33] see Millennium now I saw a new Heaven
[34:37] and a new Earth coming down from God
[34:39] hallelujah praise God now he moves from
[34:44] the world and we're talking now see the
[34:46] same phases
[34:49] the same phases uh let me use the term
[34:53] three steps to a birth
[34:55] right three steps to a birth and he's
[34:59] used and is using the same phases of the
[35:04] Natural Earth that God took the natural
[35:07] or true the flood of Noah the baptism of
[35:12] blood of Jesus Christ and then the
[35:15] baptism holy ghost at Pentecost that
[35:17] came and That Came Upon them at that
[35:21] time but for the Natural Earth I just
[35:24] mixed the spiritual and the natural day
[35:26] you see uh but for the natural art that
[35:30] will go right to the end of things when
[35:32] the fire of God burns up the Natural
[35:35] Earth
[35:37] to renovate it that's the word to
[35:41] renovate it not destroy it but to
[35:44] renovate it or to make it new praise the
[35:48] Lord because he said I saw a new Heaven
[35:50] from the new Earth praise God hallelujah
[35:53] amen but you see
[35:55] God did the same thing with Jesus
[35:59] for Jesus he says was baptized in water
[36:04] then he came Sanctified to begin with
[36:09] already by the father
[36:11] hallelujah amen
[36:14] then you see then the Dove came upon him
[36:19] and claimed that part of the life that
[36:25] was here part of the earth praise the
[36:29] Lord quickly just like you and me he's
[36:32] come back to claim that part of his life
[36:35] that is in that part of the earth in
[36:38] this hour right and eternal can only
[36:41] call out to Eternal and him God only
[36:45] calling to God and deep can only call to
[36:48] deepen that sort of thing and husband to
[36:51] wife and so on now praise God that's
[36:54] what's going on here right now
[36:56] that was taking place now praise the
[37:00] Lord that's why we feel appalled a
[37:02] pulsation within our heart that we can't
[37:05] put into words to explain to them but
[37:09] something struck the tune in Fork within
[37:11] our soul we hear a sound we hear a
[37:15] certain sound and it appeals to it and
[37:18] draws us very much into the presence of
[37:21] the Living God hallelujah amen praise
[37:24] God see and when that happens
[37:28] destroy this Temple I'll rise it up
[37:31] again in other words that can't die that
[37:35] can't die there and so when a man or a
[37:39] woman
[37:40] really comes into God
[37:44] completely now not under some spell of
[37:49] some church or under some emotion or
[37:53] real or like that but they really come
[37:57] when the word and him becomes one
[38:03] when that happens that person is saved
[38:07] amen Sanctified from the things of the
[38:11] world Hallelujah and the spirit begins
[38:14] to renovate everything of the world away
[38:18] from them with the fire of the Holy
[38:21] Ghost amen I thank God he's still
[38:24] renovating on me
[38:25] I thank God the renovation is still
[38:28] going on it's not finished yet but he's
[38:31] renovating this being let's hear praise
[38:35] the name of the Lord glory be to God
[38:38] hallelujah you see that fire falls
[38:42] and he then lives in the person
[38:47] and he lives in the person to reflect
[38:50] himself
[38:52] Hallelujah you see why he had to
[38:54] renovate you you see why he the fire had
[38:57] to come praise God so that he can come
[39:00] now and live in his own Temple not one
[39:05] that Solomon built he says you you want
[39:08] to build me a temple but I living a
[39:10] temple that is not made by hands human
[39:13] hands amen praise God and we know we are
[39:18] the Temple of the Holy Ghost and God
[39:21] dwells in us but you see he had he lives
[39:26] now in that person
[39:28] to reflect himself
[39:30] oh to reflect
[39:34] that perfect man
[39:36] that perfect woman because they are
[39:40] living by the word praise God hallelujah
[39:44] you got Perfection I said Perfection is
[39:47] within you because Perfection is Jesus
[39:50] Christ there is none other perfect uh
[39:53] than he is and perfectionist there we're
[39:56] not talking about this stumbling uh or
[39:59] fearful doubting a man on the outside
[40:03] born in sin shaped and then if we come
[40:05] to the world speaking lies but we're
[40:08] talking about the other man the inside
[40:10] man that God has in their praise be to
[40:14] God forevermore glory to God hallelujah
[40:18] amen see and so we see that praise the
[40:23] Lord see he wants the that part
[40:27] just Jesus Christ now he wants to use
[40:30] this Earth praise the Lord in the same
[40:34] way so he redeems it
[40:36] praise the Lord to make you a vessel for
[40:40] his honor and Glory
[40:42] Hallelujah praise God now let's watch
[40:46] the same three steps in the church the
[40:50] church as a whole let's watch the three
[40:52] steps here now like Adam Farrell he
[40:56] doesn't say that I'm saying it praise
[40:58] the Lord I shouldn't say that you just
[41:00] listen praise the Lord see now uh
[41:04] the church fell in the ground at nicaea
[41:08] in other words I see what he's what what
[41:11] what he's wanting to say just like Adam
[41:13] fell back there now the church fell and
[41:17] Adam fell there to throw the whole world
[41:19] in sin the church failed the whole world
[41:21] in dogmas and Creeds and sins and
[41:24] everything else amen see oh my right
[41:28] into organization hallelujah amen see
[41:32] and what happened later
[41:36] he began to bring her out under
[41:39] temporary Resurrection
[41:43] oh my and he tried to do that through
[41:47] using Luther
[41:49] now notice using Luther doing the same
[41:55] thing as he did through Noah
[41:58] amen
[42:00] justification sanctification same three
[42:03] steps back again okay oh my but Luther
[42:09] failed
[42:11] for he organized
[42:14] he failed the word hallelujah
[42:17] now but he started it he started the
[42:22] church his resurrection all right so the
[42:26] church comes up and she was just a
[42:29] little leaf didn't look like the
[42:32] original grain that went into the ground
[42:35] see because now notice
[42:40] the church was only being used as a
[42:44] carrier for the life baby
[42:47] for example Mary
[42:50] right it was used as a carrier for the
[42:54] life that's all of us elected that was
[42:58] in the church down Through the Ages
[43:00] right down to this time
[43:03] is that right the church as much as you
[43:06] you know we preach we talk the church
[43:08] this we speak about denomination but
[43:11] you've got to recognize I'm not saying
[43:13] we're going to go there and glorify them
[43:15] now but you've got to understand that
[43:18] God had to have them and have that
[43:21] vessel for us to be able to come and be
[43:25] made manifest in this day and in this
[43:27] hour praise the Lord see no mind see
[43:31] it's the carrier of the life now you
[43:36] know Wesley's message was closer to the
[43:40] Bible than Luther's message
[43:42] amen hallelujah and after that
[43:47] the Pentecostals
[43:49] but what came out of the Pentecostals
[43:52] praise God now when that first little
[43:56] grain of wheat comes out on the stock of
[43:59] wheat it absolutely like its grain it
[44:04] looks like green is that right but what
[44:07] is it it is not green that is the hour
[44:12] Jesus spoke of Matthew 24 24. oh so
[44:18] close that it would deceive the elect if
[44:23] it were possible amen it's not where
[44:26] he's talking about the hour of
[44:28] Temptation spoken of in Revelation the
[44:31] hour of Temptation and deception when
[44:34] the church matures to the point just
[44:37] past the Pentecostals when they have
[44:40] come to their rightness and they start
[44:43] looking like they're green that's the
[44:46] hour of Temptation and and deception
[44:49] right there because the thing is so
[44:51] close he says that it's the it was
[44:55] deceive even the elect if it were
[44:58] possible
[45:00] oh my what an hour that we are living in
[45:05] Hallelujah
[45:07] but it does look like the brain
[45:11] see
[45:12] now you will have to sit down and really
[45:17] get a microscope from somewhere oh thank
[45:22] God he's given us a microscope
[45:25] Hallelujah the eyes of the spirit the
[45:28] eyes of a prophet the eyes of the Holy
[45:30] Spirit to look at the word amen
[45:33] hallelujah and see when you take that
[45:38] microscope glass and begin to really
[45:41] check it out pull this back pull that
[45:45] back you'll find out it's nothing but a
[45:49] shock foreign
[45:50] a carrier if God used it not only as a
[45:56] carrier but he used it also to protect
[46:00] the grain oh blessed be the name of the
[46:04] Lord so in the middle of all of their
[46:08] jumping on their carrying on and so on
[46:11] God looking at his elect but he allowed
[46:14] them to pass through these phases
[46:17] so they can come to where they are amen
[46:22] see they spoken towns they did this they
[46:28] did that right they look exactly like
[46:32] the green
[46:34] but you go get a good glass
[46:37] look back there
[46:39] and there's a little Bob of grain coming
[46:42] on
[46:43] there is the real thing but this is a
[46:48] carrier it's there to protect the grain
[46:53] it's working
[46:55] in harmony with the grain amen when
[47:00] you're amongst them and you're a member
[47:02] of them and their denomination
[47:03] everything is fine everything is dandy
[47:06] wonderful praise God working in harmony
[47:08] but you see that he did that to protect
[47:14] that grain amen hallelujah oh my our
[47:19] seed praise the Lord now that grand come
[47:23] up and pass through all them lutherans
[47:26] Wesley through there and come right up
[47:28] down and to that hour of the Pentecostal
[47:32] and now it looks so perfectly
[47:37] no wonder Jesus said it would deceive
[47:41] the very elected if it were possible
[47:46] hallelujah amen so when the process gets
[47:50] to this stage
[47:52] if the hour of deception
[47:56] but at the same time is the hour of the
[47:59] glass of Revelation right the two comes
[48:04] together revelation God conquers Satan
[48:07] coming with his deception so the same
[48:10] hour of deception is the hour when
[48:14] Revelation goes to a higher octave to
[48:17] detect the Antichrist Spirit
[48:20] right in the church amen because you
[48:23] realize uh I I'm talking about the
[48:26] Pentecostals but it's gone further now
[48:29] amen and every time he goes up iron God
[48:33] raises up a standard against him and now
[48:36] he is hiding in the message he's hiding
[48:39] in the light
[48:40] he's hiding right in the open
[48:43] oh my think about it oh praise God now
[48:48] notice here
[48:50] oh we are living
[48:53] in in this hour and we know that any
[48:58] Revival
[49:00] only lasts about three years
[49:03] and then out of that Revival will come
[49:08] an organization
[49:10] brother sister and he's speaking at that
[49:14] time now look how many years I've passed
[49:16] he says this revival has gone on for 15
[49:23] years and there has come no organization
[49:28] out of it
[49:30] in this 15-year Revival
[49:34] listen
[49:35] I have lived in it
[49:39] I have been privileged to live in it and
[49:44] to be with you in it
[49:47] oh praise God hallelujah
[49:50] there hasn't been an organization come
[49:53] out of it out of this message
[49:56] there are no more organizations there
[50:00] won't be amen doesn't mean out in the
[50:03] world they're not going to be forming
[50:04] organizations every day but out of this
[50:08] message there will be no organizations
[50:11] amen
[50:13] there is the last of it amen but
[50:17] Pentecost was allowed and had to be
[50:20] there
[50:22] to protect this
[50:24] well amen and where would we have been
[50:28] with this message if God had not allowed
[50:32] Pentecost to be there
[50:34] so that the grain could emerge out of
[50:37] Pentecost that's what he's talking about
[50:39] and that's why many times I say
[50:43] um unless they don't attack you don't
[50:46] attack them
[50:48] uh if God didn't use the Baptist the
[50:52] Pentecost to teach the people the Bible
[50:53] you won't be able to go even witness to
[50:56] them they're going to have any biblical
[50:58] knowledge they won't have any background
[51:01] or foundations
[51:02] to be able to receive the truth of the
[51:06] word of the Living God Amen I want you
[51:11] to know the truth
[51:14] and I must say this
[51:17] I have not got much time left
[51:22] you know that I am 55 years old
[51:28] but long after I'm gone
[51:31] these steps will live on can you say
[51:34] Amen
[51:36] and then you'll see whether this is
[51:41] right or not
[51:42] you'll see
[51:44] if I am a true servant
[51:47] or I am some false prophet amen
[51:52] everything I've told you it's all come
[51:56] to pass hallelujah amen and I've never
[52:00] told you nothing yet but that it
[52:03] happened
[52:04] see but Pentecost was just a carrier see
[52:10] now the life is telling us that Christ
[52:12] is on earth now the life is now here
[52:15] praise God a greater than Solomon is
[52:19] here
[52:20] oh blessed be the name of the Lord now
[52:23] but you see when the wheat the wheat is
[52:28] talking about us now the seed of God in
[52:32] the bride amen when the wheat begins to
[52:37] grow
[52:38] like the the the Jewish church was a
[52:43] carrier for Jesus himself
[52:47] but when
[52:49] he began to tell them the truth of God's
[52:54] word that's when there began to separate
[52:58] from him you see what I'm talking about
[53:02] that's the hour that's the junction
[53:05] that's the time when the separation
[53:07] begins when they come not when we start
[53:10] out with the message
[53:12] just like he said not when he started
[53:14] out with the message but when it came to
[53:17] his turtle and began to say I see I and
[53:21] my father are one foreign
[53:29] oh my certain of God he's confident he
[53:33] knows who he is
[53:35] he knows who is and when the bride
[53:38] begins to know who she is oh praise God
[53:41] hallelujah that's the hour amen oh
[53:45] praise God no what did he say in the
[53:48] seals he says Satan then you better be
[53:50] careful amen praise God now notice
[53:54] that's the time of separation
[53:57] when they begin to tell them the truth
[54:03] that's when they're separated from him
[54:08] and now what is happening the same thing
[54:12] again amen when you speak the truth the
[54:15] Revelation is what strikes the brain
[54:17] which it has shocked her and she's
[54:20] beginning to say it back what she
[54:23] received then brother sister that's what
[54:26] caused the separation right there like
[54:29] they said to him where you see that in
[54:32] the word where it's written where did
[54:35] Moses say that he didn't say it in those
[54:38] words but I'm saying it to you
[54:41] Hallelujah now with a bride now he's
[54:44] using that technology to say when the
[54:46] bride or the grain the true seed of God
[54:49] comes to that stage again when she uh
[54:54] understands the revelation of the word
[54:58] hallelujah then she stands certain of
[55:02] God she begins to speak that word she
[55:05] becomes the voice of God she becomes the
[55:08] voice the seven Sanders began to express
[55:11] itself to her amen when she knows what
[55:16] to do with the word of God Amen
[55:19] see
[55:21] when they begin to tell the truth of
[55:25] Hallelujah because that wheat must lay
[55:29] itself before the presence of the sun he
[55:33] says s-o-n-s-u-n praise God see I'm
[55:36] talking about the spiritual wheat has
[55:39] got to lay before the sun Hallelujah the
[55:43] spiritual wheat now praise God must lay
[55:46] before the Sun so that it can be turned
[55:50] into golden grain of the world or in
[55:54] other words be made the word
[56:00] and I say for this hour
[56:03] made the word hallelujah praise God
[56:07] hallelujah now see not only that she has
[56:12] made the word
[56:14] but again God made flesh and Vindicated
[56:20] Why by the word amen praise God oh
[56:24] praise God didn't he say the word is
[56:26] becoming flesh and flesh is going back
[56:28] to being word oh praise God forevermore
[56:31] you come from God you're going back to
[56:34] God Amen yes sir praise God you come
[56:38] from being a part of God you're going
[56:39] back to his side again amen praise the
[56:42] name of the Lord yes sir now he that
[56:46] believeth on me
[56:49] the works I do shall he do and the true
[56:52] church that lives by the word rightly
[56:56] not by organization but lays itself in
[56:59] the presence of the word the sun see
[57:03] that it becomes what it becomes the very
[57:08] same word that came down on them under
[57:12] their Pentecost
[57:14] the same word hallelujah and of course
[57:17] he says the word is a spirit and we know
[57:19] that praise the Lord in that day
[57:23] I believe it is Jesus said when the son
[57:27] of man is being revealed amen he says
[57:32] listen I am saying when the son of man
[57:36] is being revealed not a man being
[57:41] revealed
[57:42] praise the Lord so in a nice ways
[57:45] referring to himself because he could
[57:47] all maybe he saw what was going to
[57:50] happen so it's not a man being revealed
[57:53] but the son of man is being revealed
[57:57] Christ is making himself known
[57:59] Hallelujah so all these others are
[58:01] talking about themselves about being son
[58:04] of man or when the when man landed on
[58:07] the moon that's when the Holy Spirit
[58:08] landed on him when he becomes the son of
[58:10] man and all these kind of false
[58:12] teachings and stuff like that I I won't
[58:15] repeat them lest one of you believe that
[58:20] but if you're a true seed of God you
[58:23] can't
[58:23] amen that's why I feel free to speak the
[58:26] word
[58:28] make a praise God I can't they can feel
[58:31] free to speak the word of God hallelujah
[58:34] amen see now you see I say when the son
[58:38] of man is being revealed not the man
[58:41] being revealed
[58:42] not some organization
[58:48] being revealed
[58:51] but the son of man what is that the word
[58:56] itself
[58:57] returning the word itself living himself
[59:01] again amongst his people glory to God
[59:06] God in us hallelujah oh praise God God
[59:11] in Christ Christ in the church and now
[59:13] he says the kingdom coming glory to God
[59:16] hallelujah amen so it's a word that's
[59:20] coming again itself made flesh he says
[59:24] in you
[59:27] then you are a reflection
[59:30] of this message of this hour
[59:34] you become a reflection of it because
[59:38] what see you can't die anymore not your
[59:42] body but the man inside you can't die
[59:44] amen amen because you are living that
[59:48] life
[59:49] [Music]
[59:50] that was Jesus Christ
[59:53] you're living the same life that was
[59:55] Jesus Christ how are you going to die
[59:57] see and what you are doing now you are
[1:00:01] laying in the presence of the sun
[1:00:05] Hallelujah and when you do the rest of
[1:00:10] the shock begins to separate itself from
[1:00:15] the beat see what I was trying to tell
[1:00:18] you I repeated over and over it's not us
[1:00:21] God's word called for total separation
[1:00:24] it's not us separating ourselves from
[1:00:27] people
[1:00:28] right right
[1:00:30] it's the Holy Spirit causing that to
[1:00:34] take place without us doing nothing or
[1:00:37] saying nothing
[1:00:39] it's his work it's his plan that we sure
[1:00:42] came right down from the beginning right
[1:00:44] on down and we are now in the last phase
[1:00:47] when the shock of all all parts All
[1:00:52] Phases of the life of a shock amen right
[1:00:56] down from Luther right through the
[1:00:58] Pentecostal and now infiltrate the
[1:01:01] message like it infiltrated Jesus's
[1:01:03] church right there we are right there in
[1:01:06] this hour right now and that is what's
[1:01:10] taking place amen hallelujah and the
[1:01:13] separation comes when that shark pulls
[1:01:17] itself away
[1:01:20] Hallelujah when it begins to be
[1:01:23] manifested
[1:01:25] amen see oh what happened see the life
[1:01:31] went out of them and all that life now
[1:01:34] goes into the grain Hallelujah and once
[1:01:39] that life is in the green that life
[1:01:42] won't change and it does not change amen
[1:01:46] but the carriers
[1:01:49] they changed
[1:01:52] they have to change
[1:01:55] and they have to denominate see for
[1:01:59] strength in other words they got to
[1:02:02] combine their strength together uh one
[1:02:05] will chase a thousand ten you know uh
[1:02:08] will chase ten thousand they gotta
[1:02:10] combine just to fight one believer so
[1:02:12] they're gonna combine their their forces
[1:02:15] together see they have to change they
[1:02:18] must denominate see but the wheat cannot
[1:02:23] change
[1:02:24] right it's your original sea that can't
[1:02:27] change
[1:02:28] it come from God that is going back to
[1:02:30] God hallelujah praise the name of the
[1:02:33] Lord see let me repeat it now
[1:02:38] the shock has to pull away from
[1:02:44] the
[1:02:45] wheat
[1:02:48] and that
[1:02:49] is God's plan
[1:02:52] that is God's Providence amen
[1:02:57] he says it again the shark has to pull
[1:03:02] away or separate
[1:03:04] from that wit
[1:03:06] why is it pulling away
[1:03:09] because now the wheat is in that
[1:03:13] maturing stage amen the wheat is
[1:03:16] maturing in the word of God hallelujah
[1:03:19] and he's finding less and less places to
[1:03:22] hide
[1:03:23] less and less places that he can deceive
[1:03:25] so so he's got to pull away oh my God
[1:03:31] that seed is maturing now now the shock
[1:03:36] now was only a supporter it was only a
[1:03:41] carrier of the life it was only a
[1:03:44] protector Hallelujah but now the life is
[1:03:47] right out there in other words the life
[1:03:49] isn't in them anymore the life is out
[1:03:51] there manifesting
[1:03:53] amen and and it's right there with the
[1:03:57] grain oh friends what a day hey we are
[1:04:01] living in praise God I want to say
[1:04:03] praise God hallelujah oh praise God
[1:04:06] forevermore he says do you know
[1:04:11] and I'm winding this down they're trying
[1:04:13] to make me make an organization
[1:04:18] they came to me and said brother Branham
[1:04:22] will you make an organization based on
[1:04:26] your ministry
[1:04:28] I said not me
[1:04:30] those are the words he got here not me
[1:04:34] oh my oh and I'm not here talking about
[1:04:38] me see you see them missing the point
[1:04:42] amen I am talking about this message of
[1:04:47] the hour and of this day that's what I
[1:04:50] am talking about amen hallelujah and
[1:04:54] some of them didn't listen they went up
[1:04:58] there now watch it now right up there
[1:05:02] into Canada

[1:05:34] started out there under the influence of
[1:05:37] the latter rain all coming out from
[1:05:40] Brother branham's Ministry but he told
[1:05:42] them plain he wants nothing to do with
[1:05:44] it he's not back of it and he's not
[1:05:46] founding nothing like that see like that
[1:05:50] no
[1:05:51] and so then oh praise God no yes
[1:05:58] and they made millions of converts from
[1:06:03] that
[1:06:05] and made them
[1:06:07] slows the slaves
[1:06:11] slaves of their Creeds this is
[1:06:15] terminology you know or what Revelation
[1:06:18] says in horror will be found the soul
[1:06:21] slaves The Souls of man amen here is our
[1:06:24] souls there are slaves to their Creeds
[1:06:27] amen no my becoming rich building
[1:06:31] millions and millions and billions of
[1:06:34] dollars in buildings and things like
[1:06:36] that saying the Lord is coming the Lord
[1:06:38] is coming sending out preachers to
[1:06:41] seminaries and things and educating them
[1:06:43] on some man-made theology amen I almost
[1:06:47] said popsicle but uh oh my oh and it all
[1:06:53] become nothing but a shock
[1:06:57] Amen in other words not that they were
[1:06:59] completely useless it wasn't God's will
[1:07:02] but out of them came out people that
[1:07:06] believe the message of the hour
[1:07:08] that if you know that praise God we have
[1:07:11] brother Hildebrandt we got other
[1:07:13] brothers many others that came out
[1:07:15] because they knew about it but they came
[1:07:18] out of it praise God and God used them
[1:07:22] in their office or they have to stay
[1:07:25] right there praise God and it becomes
[1:07:29] shock hallelujah amen but now we know
[1:07:33] them denominational and Pentecostal
[1:07:36] spirits
[1:07:38] have now found their way right into this
[1:07:42] message
[1:07:44] and that is their High form of deception
[1:07:48] that's going on
[1:07:51] it looked like a man
[1:07:53] but it was a serpent it looked like a
[1:07:56] believer
[1:07:56] but but it could be a judo Spirit it
[1:07:59] could be Antichrist Spirit it could be
[1:08:00] an unbelieving spirit I don't know but
[1:08:03] I'm just trying to cast something for
[1:08:05] you so you can see what the word what
[1:08:07] the word is trying to tell us why we got
[1:08:10] to be so vigilant
[1:08:12] and watchful praise the Lord hiding in a
[1:08:15] message trying to pervert it
[1:08:18] stay in it long enough and try to
[1:08:20] subvert it
[1:08:22] try it or stay in the message in every
[1:08:24] possible way and trying to undermine the
[1:08:28] kingdom of God
[1:08:29] somewhere in and some are out and the
[1:08:32] whole thing is working uh under uh
[1:08:35] satanic deception and Leadership but
[1:08:39] thank God he says thanks be to God the
[1:08:42] grave is still going on
[1:08:46] and that God has traveled on down and is
[1:08:49] here tonight

[1:08:54] thankful to God hallelujah amen oh my
[1:08:58] don't you see how much longer do we have
[1:09:01] here how much longer have we got amen
[1:09:05] see I hear the coming of the combined
[1:09:10] I hear it
[1:09:11] the world counseling he says here the
[1:09:14] World Council amen and she will separate
[1:09:20] it now he's gone from spiritual back to
[1:09:23] natural and saying in the natural
[1:09:26] she's going to separate it and by doing
[1:09:29] that separation of the true and the
[1:09:32] false is we're all not buying and
[1:09:35] selling and all those kinds of things
[1:09:37] are going to come in that's the natural
[1:09:38] separation but spiritually the word is
[1:09:42] already doing that separation now the
[1:09:45] word is separating us praise the Lord
[1:09:47] hallelujah but what are they going to do
[1:09:50] they'll separate it amen praise God what
[1:09:55] will she do then oh my she will shave
[1:09:59] off all the rest of them stock that's in
[1:10:02] other words hanging on in the midst and
[1:10:04] hanging on in her he said she'll shave
[1:10:07] off all of that stalker under and then
[1:10:11] she'll get on that elevator that's
[1:10:14] waiting for her and she'll go home one
[1:10:17] of these mornings oh praise God
[1:10:20] hallelujah amen I know when he's talking
[1:10:22] about Canada and Out West there all you
[1:10:25] can see is is wheat fields for aspires I
[1:10:28] could see amen they usually make a joke
[1:10:31] saying that if your your dog wanders
[1:10:34] away from home you can see him into
[1:10:37] tomorrow uh it's still out there on the
[1:10:40] horizon
[1:10:41] because it's so
[1:10:43] black I'm playing with wheat amen so
[1:10:46] when he's saying here what has she got
[1:10:48] left nothing but to get in the grain
[1:10:51] elevator
[1:10:53] and God taking the grain home praise the
[1:10:57] Lord
[1:10:58] amen yes sir and I tell you she'll go
[1:11:02] home one of these mornings
[1:11:04] I know the world won't believe this
[1:11:10] in truth they can't believe it
[1:11:15] now he's saying that it's not me there
[1:11:17] he says they can't believe it
[1:11:20] and because of that we just feel sorry
[1:11:24] for them
[1:11:25] we feel sorry cause no man can come
[1:11:30] except my father draws him
[1:11:34] and all my father has given me will come
[1:11:38] to me
[1:11:40] praise God all my father you see if
[1:11:45] their name is on The Book of Life
[1:11:49] then they will certainly recognize this
[1:11:54] word is that right amen why do you
[1:11:57] recognize it where were you when the
[1:11:59] morning Stars sang together and the sons
[1:12:01] of God were shouting for joy and if you
[1:12:04] were there and you are worshiping him
[1:12:06] and praising him and glorifying him
[1:12:08] there and he was always the word and
[1:12:11] you're going to recognize the word hair
[1:12:13] just because it comes in a word form or
[1:12:15] it comes in a spoken word form you have
[1:12:18] recognize the word
[1:12:20] Hallelujah that's why they won't even
[1:12:23] know about nor Rapture because they
[1:12:24] can't even recognize this word so when
[1:12:26] the word comes to her now they're going
[1:12:28] to see it they won't they won't
[1:12:29] recognize that all this Illusions they
[1:12:32] have of standing up and watching people
[1:12:34] rising going up in the in the air in a
[1:12:37] Rapture is just nonsense it's not in the
[1:12:39] word
[1:12:40] they won't see anything they don't have
[1:12:43] that ability to see that amen oh I know
[1:12:47] the world won't believe that they can't
[1:12:51] believe it just feel sorry for them see
[1:12:55] oh my but if
[1:12:59] that man's name is on The Book of Life
[1:13:02] they'll recognize the word
[1:13:06] he has got to
[1:13:09] amen
[1:13:10] oh my we would have no more organization
[1:13:15] but because all the organizations will
[1:13:19] go into one
[1:13:21] they are binding themselves together for
[1:13:24] the burning
[1:13:25] together in one great organization
[1:13:30] but there will be no more organization
[1:13:36] why the wheat is now here
[1:13:41] he must recognize some people right back
[1:13:44] there while he was yet preaching that
[1:13:46] had caught his message
[1:13:48] caught the genuine revelation
[1:13:51] he says because the wheat is here then
[1:13:55] he it says it raised his hands I say
[1:13:58] thanks be to God the wheat is now here
[1:14:03] praise God Christ is now here
[1:14:07] he proven his word Lord of God that's
[1:14:12] the truth the wheat he repeats again is
[1:14:16] now here and it is beginning it's
[1:14:20] maturing now
[1:14:23] oh praise God it's now laying in the
[1:14:27] presence of the Sun and maturing oh
[1:14:31] praise God and the rest of it is pulling
[1:14:35] away from him oh praise God they say we
[1:14:38] have nothing to do with that we would
[1:14:40] have anything to do with that amen oh my
[1:14:43] oh brother sister if there is anything I
[1:14:47] must say make sure get in the wheat know
[1:14:51] who you are amen praise God glory to God
[1:14:54] now he says and this is really closing
[1:14:57] now
[1:14:59] he says there was a doctor
[1:15:02] and he was a fine man
[1:15:05] he loved poor people
[1:15:07] and every time the poor
[1:15:10] came for treatment
[1:15:13] and they couldn't pay
[1:15:17] he let them go
[1:15:19] and after a while their deaths would
[1:15:21] accumulate of how much they owed him
[1:15:24] and got so large sometimes
[1:15:28] he'd take a piece of paper and write
[1:15:30] their name
[1:15:33] and said forgiven
[1:15:36] and then sign below it
[1:15:39] he did that many times and finally
[1:15:42] the doctor died oh my I can see the
[1:15:46] great physician Oh my he died
[1:15:50] and when the doctor died
[1:15:53] his wife was totally arrogant talking
[1:15:57] about the Jewish church then of course
[1:15:59] spiritual at least that's what I believe
[1:16:02] she was different see different
[1:16:06] just like the church Has Come Today this
[1:16:09] one is on the organization the other one
[1:16:11] was on the Orthodox Faith Orthodoxy
[1:16:14] right and tradition amen and she went
[1:16:19] around finding all them people and
[1:16:22] grounding them all together and brought
[1:16:26] a big lawsuit
[1:16:28] against them and throw them all into the
[1:16:33] court
[1:16:34] and told them to their face you're going
[1:16:38] to pay them bills anyhow
[1:16:42] amen you're gonna pay them
[1:16:45] he goes to court
[1:16:48] and the judge picks up the receipts and
[1:16:51] begins to examine them and said could
[1:16:55] you come here just one moment Madam
[1:16:57] would you come right here and he called
[1:17:00] her up to where he was sitting and he
[1:17:02] said is this red ink
[1:17:06] your husband's genuine signature she
[1:17:10] says yes sir it is he says then there's
[1:17:13] not one court in the land that can sue
[1:17:16] any one of these people standing here
[1:17:19] today they are everyone free of praise
[1:17:23] God forevermore Hallelujah
[1:17:25] the devil can't bring a lawsuit against
[1:17:28] your bill the devil can't bear against a
[1:17:31] lawsuit against your brother amen we are
[1:17:34] free thank God we are free amen because
[1:17:37] the blood of Jesus Christ signed with
