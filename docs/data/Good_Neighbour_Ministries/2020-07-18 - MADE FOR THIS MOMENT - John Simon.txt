god bless us all together as we look into the perfect law of liberty expecting to receive the blessing of god upon our lives and the confirmation of who we are and i want you to have confidence and knowing that you are alive in the right times you are the right person and you are in the right place for god's use and for his glory hallelujah now just to let you know god bless you i have no uh resource of of um a team back of me preparing these sermons i have no great financial resources of any nature my dependency is upon god amen i rely only upon the most high for his presence most of all for without him we can do nothing but with him we are everything one man anointed by god is a majority glory to his name praise god let us have a word of prayer before reading out of the holy book the scriptures a gracious heavenly father are wonderful to greet my beloved brethren from around the world and those who are present here within the boundaries of burlington hamilton oakville toronto and the environment byron's roundabout we praying that the great holy spirit of almighty god will anoint us together and father together will be caught up in the rhapsody of christ take glory and honor in the name of jesus christ for your glory amen and amen out of the book of first peter chapter 1 reading blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy had begotten us again on to lying a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of god through faith salvation ready to be revealed in the last time ready to be revealed in the last time thanks be to god friends we live in tremendous and momentous times as we will all be conscious of that great earth-shaking events are unfolding even as we speak great uh cataclysmic events are now in progress events with prophetic outlook on out are now in progress they vary earth and all the world systems and all the nations are experiencing the the burp pains of a new a brand new millennium is just about to dawn as one ends another one is about to be born now these tumultuous times in which we live are significant as coming events are casting their shadows upon the curtains of time these events these supernatural signs that are upon the earth lights mysterious lights appearing mysterious happenings upon the face of the earth earthquakes tidal waves typhoons hurricanes pestilences uh all manner of strange events in nature earth and sky are taking place and so friends these things are here and these are all emerging changes in the flow of human history now we know we are living in the sixth millennium i believe of course that our lord jesus christ returns towards the ending towards the ending of the sixth millennium which we are in at this time now we realize that the that that the word six the the word the number six is the number of men so we know we're living in man's day this is not the lord's day as yet but it's man's day where it's man's ideas minds inventions man's science man's wisdom even man's uh church that he has shaped through the figment of his imagination and his interpretation from the word of god into a system of what he think god uh loves or god will want just like cain making an altar a beautiful and a beautiful system but he thinks that because of the beauty of it that's what will make god love it but here was bell with a raw rugged uh significant gospel the slaying of a lamb the blood spraying everywhere oh my god how could that be a sign of the messiah to come but it was a prophetic symbol and sign of the coming lamb of god that will be taking away the sins of the world and god abel god made about by revelation to recognize what the plan of god was that since by sin came man it had to be god coming in the form of a man to deliver the entire human race and so we come back to the fact that this number six and 666 everyone knows that and the number six relates to man for it is the number of men and we live in the man's day and man's time now we realize friends that uh millennium when we use the word millennium comes from the latin word mille which means one thousand one thousand so we said the sixth millennium 6000 years as far as we know of the world the earth's existence is what we're talking about that we are living in that sixth millennium praise god hallelujah and so the fifth millennium has passed already and we are now in the sixth one every two thousand years a clap christmas or event takes place something terrible happens and now living in the sixth millennium two two thousand year periods have already passed second millennium fourth millennium now we're in the sixth millennium at the end of each something tremendous happened now we're almost to the ending of the sixth millennium something is fixing to take place my friends with this awareness as human beings have we lost any sense of god have we lost the sense of the supernatural have we any spiritual intelligence to recognize that there is something eventful fixing to their place even when there is an earthquake or some terrible a storm coming the animals the nature knows it long before human beings are even aware of it as god said the stark knows the time of my coming the swallow knows the time of my coming but my people knows not the judgments of the lord may god help us to regain the supernatural intelligence that we lost from the garden of eden when man sinned against god and fell into this state of ruin and in despair so here we are in the sixth millennium and the signs on the earth are pointing to it at this particular time in the first millennium the first thousand years well it was a time of change when the millennium comes to its end a time of tremendous change and we understand at that time the world was flooded out the world was flooded out oh my and there was we're noah which jesus said that time of noah will repeat again back there they were trying to build a castle a building that will go right up into the heavens uh and they uh it was really a form of rebellion of satan that he is going to find a way even though he was cast out he will now find an artificial way to climb up back into the presence of almighty god but it was not possible for god broke the entire thing down and later as we know there was great a flooding that took place upon we understand flooding that took place upon the face of the earth now recognize men today are actually trying to do the same things doing it by rocket ships doing it by satellites but god already spoke in the book of isaiah though you go up and try to make your nest your home among the stars lo i shall bring thee down oh may god have mercy upon us to recognize now speaking on this first millennium the world was flooded and no was the man that was used for that moment now my emphasis today is to let you know whoever you are brother sister no matter how insignificant you think you are god has you here on time in this age on the earth in this place and position for his divine purpose to fulfill the manifestation of his word and so you and i we together are the people for this moment you are the person that god has placed here for this moment along with your other brothers and sisters we were predestinated by the hand of god to be here upon the earth for this hour and to meet every challenge of the enemy every doubt every fear and to overcome them by the manifestation of the word of god through our lives thank god for noah who was a ignore of the word he was open to the revelation of the holy spirit of the living god at that time as in our time the imagination of men's hearts were evil man's heart the bible says were evil continually figuring out all vain imaginations of schemes and tricks whatever it was the bible said violence covered the land what what a culture we are living in now guns murder mass murder death on every hand bloodshed blood flowing in our streets death and violence everywhere all the works of man's hand yes sir and then noah being on the scene he had a destiny and being armed with the revealed word of god for his day he withstood all the armies of satan and stood unashamed as one man in the door of that ark and before he even built the ark he announced god told him to build an ark he was made a mocking stock a laughingstock how are you going to escape how are you going to get out of here and more than that no are you building an ark on top of a mountain you you would want to build it in the valley but no he knew what god had said and god's thoughts are far above our thoughts so he was obeying the word of the living god so noah preached the gospel for 120 years noah built the ark as a way of escape and we are here today as the persons of this moment to declare the word of the lord a way of escape for you a way of escape for anyone and there is still room at the cross for you if you come to him now and find your place and position in the kingdom of god even if you are already a believer ask god to reveal to you his prime purpose for your life your activity that you may with certainty go about the purposes of god and then god will bless you and anoint you to perform his divine will the second millennial came it was also a time of change the world was lost in darkness it was lost in the blindness of idolatry but there on the on the plains of shinar their god ordained predestinated chose one man through which he could reflect himself and declare his divine word and that man of course was abraham for the world had drifted from the original knowledge of god that god was one god and had drifted into the paganism of idolatry carvings of stone bowing down to them and worshipping them which later in exodus god was to give us the commandments saying that anything carved by man any idols of wood stone or brass thou shall not bow down to them nor serve them declare who regardless who tells you it's okay for i the lord thy god is a jealous god and god will not stand for it it is paganism it is absolutely paganism under the disguise of christianity but at that time darkness covered the land idolatry was everywhere and abraham was not different than anybody else his father will no doubt was an idol maker sculptor carver and now that he was working along with his father but god had put him on the earth for a purpose and in the fullness of god's time when god was ready to use him or to awaken the seeds of life the potentials that were hidden in him that he knew nothing about god was ready to reveal that to him then the holy spirit god visited him amen visited him because he was predestinated to hear the voice of god the word the revealed word of god for his day for his time and for his hour god woken up by his voice and here it was god placed in his heart to restore back to the world at that time the revelation of one god amen and father abraham as we know founded the great nation of israel based on that revelation of one god to whom his descendants to this day believe in only one god the great jehovah elohim the one only and true god as christians what has been revealed to us from the word is that jehovah elohim in order to save mankind created a body for himself to indwell came down and dwelt in that body in the form of the man christ jesus having a body so the body could die on the cross to pay the redemptive purchase price of redemption for his sons and daughters but then thou he gives up the ghost and the god the spirit of god can go back into glory where it was in the first place now recognize that god used abraham abraham was an idolater like everyone else abraham was not better than anybody else but through the grace of god he was chosen by god oh we are not abraham but we are of the faith seed of abraham we are abraham's fake children because remember god gave abraham promises and one of the promises he says abraham look up to the stars for even more than these stars or even if you could cut the dust of the earth oh my your descendants are going to be number less than the sands of the seashore number less than the stars within the heavens of course we realize that that did not speak only of israel for the nation of israel is actually a very small nation but in that compound statement god had included abraham's seed faith abraham's children of faith amen abraham's faith seed so we are happy to be also children of abraham not by flesh but by faith but by revelation having the same attitude to god and the very approach to god that he had god has chosen us in this millennium in this generation to be the man and women for the moment that he could use for his glory in the midst of idolatry in the midst of darkness in the midst of drifting away from the things of god that we can stand up on his word and receive his blessing which he also promised to abraham in yours in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed not only in the nation of israel certainly but also abraham's children through faith through them the gospel will enrich the entire world for this message this the smell shall be preached into all the world and then shall the end come oh thanks be to god for his blessing upon us in these last days i'm speaking about men for the moment men and women people chosen by god for this day this time this moment god has raised us up for his glory and for his honor now the third uh millennium came along the nation of israel was again found in confusion under constant attack by her enemies oh my think about it and just about that time after saul had disobeyed god disobeyed the word of the prophet samuel god anointed david and raised him up and placed him upon the throne thank god god sets up kings and he takes down kings oh praise god when saul was taken down then a david came upon the throne at that time and god used him to defeat all of israel's enemies so that they could have peace they could have security they could have hope in this present world and praise god from david's lineage the promise was given that the messiah will come from the loins or the lineage of david that he would be a son or of the lineage of david praise god a savior of all mankind thank god for that third millennium oh praise god then comes the fourth millennium once again the world was lost in sin hopelessness injustice under invasion and under the thraldom of roman tradition roman idolatry paganism at that time spiritual darkness covered the land and evil rain everywhere just about that time the millennium chains was fixing to change from the third to the fourth amen and there came one born on the scene whose the angel said to his mother mary thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins and the world changed the darkness fled away for the son the s-u-n the s-o-n of god shined upon the scene and the people that sat in darkness saw a great light in the person and life of jesus christ the word of god made flesh and so the sunrise of hope dawned upon the hearts of the people supernatural lights were turned on in the world and the darkness fled away for he was the true light that shines shining into the heart of man he was my friends the the center of all history which you know to this day is divided between before christ bc and autonomy after christ here we are praise god but his life came in the very center of history well did ezekiel say he is the wheel in the middle of the wheel she is the center of our attention at the center of everything oh praise god aren't you happy for the lord jesus christ amen then came the fifth millennium another change came in the world and again the world lay in satan's grip of error corruption ignorance spiritual bondage and at that time the bible was a closed book it was a mysterious book and it was used by certain religious authorities to engender fear and superstition in the hearts and in the minds of men for the bible remain the closed book and was closely guarded by the so-called church that claimed that it was the defender of the faith as if god needs someone to defend his faith now here it is friends we understand that that was used by the roman pagans at that time the skies under the robes and guys of christianity and guarding my friends the bible unlocking up the bible and imprisoning the very word of god and ruling on the religious fear superstition and thy force at paganism and i idolatry brought from from pagan rome invading into christianity changing from a military power into a religious power upon the face of the very earth here we find my friends the light trying to shine within a so-called church saturated and steeped in religious tradition dogmas false doctrine all of this i repeat under the disguise and honor the sheepskins of christianity the word of god was chained to the rostrums the pulpits the walls of these cathedrals magnificent cathedrals in whose shadows lay the poor helpless homeless blind and those that walked and lived in fear and darkness at that particular time and the word of god even when a little portions of it was read out it was used by satan to mask it by using a language the people did not understand whether they were hearing a blessing or a curse they did not know but they were given the impression it was a holy thing to have the word of god hidden and masked away from them instead of the clear word of god so that they can judge for themselves oh my by the holy spirit and recognize what god is saying to them oh praise god brother sister what a time of day a day of darkness now we know this is just about 700 years after the times of the apostles and the people were living under that kind of religious domination trolling and fear under the spirit of feudalism and the roman inquisition uh i'm astonished that they would claim they were the ones that were being persecuted and the inquisition was against them but we know from from even natural history that it was rome that were the prime inquisitors and the ones that empowered the inquisition to be able to convert of protestants back into catholicism and there deal with them in the harshest tortures and and using all manner of racks and all manner of terrible horrible satanic inventions and cruel inventions that will strain the limits of humanity and turning men upon men into beasts squalor was everywhere hunger was everywhere superstition my friends but the millennium was ready to change time for a change time people were mad for that moment people that were there in that hour were designed for destiny praise god and it seemed in the darkness as if god had forgotten his own but never never ever get the devil to believe that you to believe that that god forgets his own for god never forgets his own he himself said in the word i will never leave you not forsake you but i'll be with you to the very end of the age well do we know that god stands in the shadows watching over his own i i'm just thinking of an old song that says standing somewhere in the shadows you will find jesus he is the lord who cares and understands yes friends he may be standing watching and he is there watching over his own as a mother watches over their own all the time praise god god never forgets his own and he never leaves them without a witness glory to god hallelujah now friends thank god shortly after that this new millennium being born oh praise god five we see it here the number of grace then the church of god acts chapter 2 came on the scene those disciples those apostles were the men and women for that moment as i believe we are those men and women for this moment to carry the word of the lord we may feel insufficient in ourselves but let me tell you by god's help we can by god's power we can by god's spirit we can and god never forgets his own but he will keep his promises as he blesses and anoints his children glory to god hallelujah now friends this is not a complicated deep dark doctrinal message of any kind but this is something to point you into the right direction this is something to inspire you something to encourage you and something that will set your heart of fire and give you purpose in the age in which we live and when suddenly the bible says suddenly when the day of pentecost was fully come and you know the rest of the story how that the holy spirit descended upon them and gave and the disciples and apostles gave great witness of the word of god and thousands were saved and baptized even on the first day without any marketing any kind of business administration public relations of any of the scientific thing we know that that has its place but certainly friends the the real movement of god the real organism of god needs god to be on their side and anointing them and using them for his glory and honor and he'll take care of the rest of it and i'm resting upon that now when the when the church was born there hallelujah my brothers and sisters the church ages began the seven church ages found in the book of revelation chapter one which the bible speaks about those church agents coming those seven ages begun right there in the time of the apostles and we find out brothers that after the death of the apostle john then came others like saint martin irenaeus polycarp who was a direct disciple of john and others later came like looter and so friends god was going to restore back the original teaching of one god lost in the garden of eden satan tried to bury it with idolatry and a multiplicity of gods god brought abraham restored it back one god again satan with his never-ending attempts trying to break it up and destroy it through israel into egyptian idolatry god brought them out by a mighty hand and there followed that story through the bible the fight between god versus satan one god versus many gods because if you don't believe in one god you start to believe in two then he can get you to believe in three and once he can get you to believe in three you can believe in 10 20 a million gods and you're not different than any other pagan religion that believes in many gods once you veer off of the revelation of heroin israel the lord thy god is one lord amen hallelujah only one god and so friends the infant church after the time of the apostles began wandering in the wilderness of darkness and false doctrine and then they were weak hidden haunted persecuted and hunted down by the religious legions of rome moving with their pagan operations anointed by the same spirits that anointed pharaoh that a minded uh nebuchadnezzar that anointed herod always to destroy and to kill out the royal seed but the royal seed of god are the people for the moment they are here to stay for they are not just physical seed of abraham but they are the spiritual faith-seeked children of abraham by the grace of god that cannot die but in them god placed a portion of his eternal life for the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ oh lord amen so here on the disguise of christianity satan operating under that guise the true church being hunted and persecuted but the church resisted and persisted by god's grace and endured slowly slowly and ever so slowly god began to bring forth men that would this declare the truth of the word of god not revelation one tells you not only the seven church ages began but god lays out from revelation one two three how he would use seven messengers each one relegated to take care of a church age and to be the angel or messenger to that church age also to be the voice of god to that church age not that the man is god but the spirit of god will be the voice speaking through the man and pointing the people back to the word and the people of that day not understanding that god didn't need anyone need their education their wisdom for it was god himself that would be speaking through that man and so even though they may try to destroy the man destroy his repetition the word of god will stand and live forever for it was not a man's word it was the word of god and his the word of god for it stands and lived forever and forever glory to god and so god sent luther on the scene we know there were others before amen praise god but then god sent looter at this after that time upon the scene with the the revelation that the just shall live by faith not by works not by by the pain of money it's not by buying yourself out of purgatory or hell it's not by any righteousness of of your own it's not that you can move the hand of god by by the size of the candles that you burn or by the multitude of them oh my friend but by faith in his word that just shall live by faith praise god hallelujah amen but then it took another 500 years from luther wesley down to pentecost to bring the church back to the place of a revelation of one god baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and the baptism of the holy ghost then came this time when malachi 4 5 should be fulfilled in the church that is still bound by traditions denomination and walking around in confusion and then god brought his servant prophet on the scene who right now many deny many refuse and will not receive but i tell you in the name of jesus christ one of these days your the world will recognize that he was a true prophet speaking in the name of the lord and around that time it was too late for some right now they do not understand fully what god is accomplishing and doing through him but the day will come when they recognize that god was using him to restore the faith of our fathers restore us back to the faith of our fathers hallelujah for god used him to reveal to us out of the word of god how clearly that eve did not eat an apple but it was adultery which this with the serpent who was not the snake at that time but later had to be put on his belly but was the missing link between uh man and the rest of the beast he was used of god to show us friends the trail of the serpent's seed oh my hallelujah satan's children operating true cain oh my friends the false and true vine that began in the garden of eden twins that came forth from eve one of god and one of the devil oh my lord may god have mercy upon us yes sir and they are present in the church even today two different spirits in operation in the midst of god's last name church and god also used that his servant prophet with the opening of the seven seal mystery book to our generation for the glory of god and god used him also to lay out the word of god in such a way that the eyes of god's chosen ones as our tech said that reserve for the latter times to be revealed in the last day i believe we are that group i believe you may be in that group predestinated for this hour and to be revealed in this last day for god will keep his bride hidden and as it was spoken will we unveil her or lift the veil that she may be revealed in the last day and then the rapture goes up it'll be too late then after that quick short mighty work and after this evil of satan and his dark legions of doom within the operating under the very framework of the church of the living god is exposed in the midst of what is called the church today that is steeped in dynamic nationalism i want you to know friends that the true believing church of god did not just tumble upon the scene but we are the apple of his eye we are the fullness of his eternal purpose here we were made for this moment you were designed with this destiny and mind you was shaped to serve him to praise him to give him glory and to carry the word of god to bear reproach for his name in this last hour oh thank god i would encourage you never be ashamed of him but stand upon the word of god and here we are standing on the brink of another millennium change from the sixth to the seventh oh glory to god hallelujah another millennium is just about to be born and the world is undergoing the throes and the birth pains of change thank god the mighty angel praise god just come down according to revelation amen 10 1-7 and by the instrumentality of the sound angel has brought forth his mighty word and said the church agents are now over time shall be no more it doesn't mean earthly time shall be no more but the time for the ages are now over the people who are of god's uh god's elected are ready to move back into the first day the new day amen praise the lord we'll expand on that in other preachings and teachings but right now friends we are in the midst of the changing of an age as i have been emphasizing uh there in the word of god hallelujah and we are not here to present to you canned bible studies of man that are so beautifully laid out and so psychologically uh placed there for you and just available for you you don't have to be more an eagle anymore think about it the changing of the age gent from gentiles to jews back again the light going from the west back to the east again lord of god yes sir oh praise god gentile the gentile day is over praise god as the songwriter said nations are breaking and israel's awakening the signs that the prophets foretold gentiled as numbered with horrors and cumbered return all dispersed to your own for the day of redemption is so near very near man's hearts are failing for fear be filled with god's spirit your lamb streamed and clear look up your redemption is there yes you were made for this moment you were made for this season and time you were designed with a destiny to fulfill the word of god for this hour to be unveiled to be revealed in this last day not just the unveiling of the mighty god back there 1900 years ago not the unveiling of the mighty god all just uh in the ministry of brother william marion branham unveiling the mighty god who is the word but the unveiling of the mighty god in the bright form it's taking place even now god revealing and unveiling his own taking his adopted sons and daughters and placing them before the public so the public would recognize that these are the sons of god these are the children of the most high oh praise god forevermore here we are friends to rail to go on and to carry the word of god nothing could completely destroy the church the conquer worm the palmer worm the caterpillar and even the locusts eating away at the true church of god and up down it right down to a stump where the devil thought the church was dead but god promised he would restore and that's the reason why he sent the prophet william marin branham to come on the scene the messenger the last church age messenger to come upon the scene and to restore back the truth of the word of god that hero israel people of god there's only one god water baptism is in the name of jesus christ there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved these are simple apparently simple themes but god hides in simplicity and reveals himself in the same oh my friends you may want to hear great deep things that'll tickle your ears and cause you to tap your feet but this is something that will speak to your heart speak to your soul and bring you to attention of the word of the living god so we were kept for a purpose preserved stored up and saved for future use this is the time when god has kept us kept to this latter time for god to use us in this hour to be god's super sign for the age to be god's advertising billboard that you can be a christian in these dark days you can live above sin in the midst of this babylonian condition you can live up in this age of demons and denominationalism you can live above it for his glory and for his honor good hallelujah amen so praise god in every home as i'm beginning to wind up now in every home there are vessels that we don't use just for every meal but they are set apart they place somewhere and then at some other time when we have special guests they have taken out their vessels of honor and when those vessels of honor that are taken out from hiding they are taken out from where they were reserved and preserved and covered up then god begins to unveil them to the world for his glory and for his honor praise god hallelujah amen now we know those vessels when they are brought out they are not for the use of eating wieners and beans and burgers and biscuits but it's there to use for the best takes the best seven course meal that you can think about is being used on those vessels and by those vessels for his glory hallelujah amen and amen special vessels special occasions to be used for the glory of god hallelujah amen and then they are set in their rightful places oh these utensils these vessels these vessels that were prepared to receive him oh my a place in the rightful positions there for the last meal for the wedding supple of the lamb of god in their rightful places glory to god hallelujah many are called but few are chosen oh praise god hallelujah amen things are set in order oh great friends it's supper time it's separate time upon the world simple time for the church of the living god hallelujah and the unveiling of the mighty god within his bride not in jesus back there but the mighty god that was unveiled in christ is now being unveiled in his beloved ones for this hour who were made and predestinated for this moment praise god hallelujah so god's true church is not a designed by man it's not designed by man's system man's organization and administration but god set in the church his supernatural spiritual administration and no matter what anyone says the book of acts is the blueprint for the church of the living god and anyone any organization any church that sways away from the blueprint and changes the dynamics the measurements the balance the plumb line of the great architect who created earth sea and sky my friends you will be in deep trouble for the great architect knows exactly what he is doing praise god hallelujah i want to thank god that we want to design for the israel was not designed to fit in to egyptian culture and the true believer is not fit in to be conformed to this world but to be transformed by the power of god the true believer israel was not designed to be slaves and to stay in a state of slavery israel was designed to be a free people and so is the true believer designed not to be a slave to the habits of sin and the works of this world but to go and enjoy the freedom of jesus christ israel was not designed to be a wandering people but to be a people in their own land given to them by the true and living god the most high they were not designed to be a people that will ever be in captivity and the true believer was not designed to remain in captivity oh for we are god's eagles for this hour the most pitiful sight is to see an eagle caged inside of a zoo with his witness feathers drooping that's those sharp talons that were created by god to hunt to receive fresh killed meat oh my that was designed by god to eat fresh killed bloody bleeding lamb word that the eagle finds itself in a denominational zoo losing those talons losing the sharpness of its curved beak amen to be able to hook on and grab and hold to god's unchanging hand of his divine word all praises holy and precious name and and so the eagle's a pitiful sight when the the eagle falls to the ground and becomes denominationally diseased with all kinds of man-made designs not meant to scrape and claw and dig for worms and dig for things up on this earth but my god the eagle was meant to soar in the heavenly places to rise up into the presence of glory of god may god help you if you've lost your wings if you've lost your your talons you lost your beak come back to your foundations come back to the word of god come back to god's original intention for you and then god will bless you and raise you up in the heavenlies where you back where you belong amen we are not designed israel was never designed for bigotry and hatred and discrimination it was not there in them oh my many call themselves jews and they are not but the bible says no they are false amen may god help us brothers to realize that a true christian do not have these qualities within their heart it's not even in them because god's love consumes them and takes them over and there is nothing else there but the love and grace of god and lastly as true believers made for the moment we were not designed for any form of defeat for first john 4 says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world praise god and also jesus said be of good courage for i have overcome the world the overcomer is in you so there is nothing that you cannot overcome for he overcomes everything for you the battle is not yours but the battle is the lord's and he is more than a conqueror who lives within you and that is the reason why we can say that also we are more than conquerors for he conquered satan sin death hell and the grave and he lives in you and me today for he said in that day you will know i'm in the father the father in me and i in you so it doesn't matter my friend what is happening in your life at this very moment believe me in the name of the lord that no matter what is happening in your life no matter how dark it is believer no matter how it is whether you are not to believe another church goal but you in your heart still a child of the most high god you were made for this moment and by god to serve him and the glory glorify his name for matthew 16 18 he says i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it you were made for this moment you were designed for this day glory to god hallelujah and you taught my friends need to conform to the world but you need to believe god and that you can still live the way god wants you to live and to overcome and live a spirit-filled holy ghost anointed life of god and believe in one god and deny these denominational teachings of three gods and three and one and all such unbelievable nonsense and come back to the original faith hero israel there is the lord thy god is one lord and no one can show me where god ever changed his mind about his word being one and suddenly becoming three god is one god and we believe in only one god and the name of that god is jesus christ and that is why we baptize in his name and we pray and do all we do in the name of jesus christ your unchanging god hallelujah amen we are still holding to god's unchanging hand for he's an unchanging god his word is unchanging and we hold to it amen we hate sin but we love the sinner as god loves the sinner but hates his sin and god designs us we have what the world needs and this is our day we're kept for this hour and to receive this revelation and to prepare for the rapture before it goes into the tribulation after which armageddon after which we will go into the great time of the great millennium which is the seventh millennium back to eden again the complete cycle of the work on the plan of god being fulfilled in our day and in our time do you recognize your position in christ and in his word that you were really designed and made for this moment designed for this day and that's the reason why you have always been different you couldn't recognize what it was you didn't know what was speaking to you what was leaving you what was guiding you what was making you act the way you were acting but you were like an eagle trying to live in a chicken pen a barn house of something nominational so-called teaching canned worms or living off of something like that but you've come to recognize your day your time your moment and that you were made for this moment the lord bless you and keep you and cause his face to shine upon you and grant you peace now and forevermore amen and amen until next wednesday this coming wednesday oh praise god 7 30 when i will be here
