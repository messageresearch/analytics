way lord and let the spirit of god [Music] a chance to speak the word he said you are the god that healed all our disease and our disease was unbelief and you've healed it you sent your word and you've healed our unbelief lord now all things are possible this morning because of that and we just stand here claiming our promises father everything that you've laid out in your world for us in this day we claim it in the name of jesus christ our healing our deliverance our supply our inheritance those that belong to us praise god as you read lord where where you sent israel in to take the land it said the word says that they went up against towers and walls and structures so high and steel and everything it looked impenetrable it looked like it was an impossible thing but every single wall fell every single thing fell so there's nothing that could stand before us in this hour as we claim our inheritance whether it be our children whether it be our bodies whether it be or whatever it might be we claim it in the name of jesus christ and we pray that you will just now bless the testimony the preaching of your word lord as we launch out into prayer as we launch out into these things that are great and powerful in this hour [Music] is [Applause] oh that's the greatest [Music] now we had uh we know brother desmond has been away he went to ghana and he'd like to testify uh this morning about his trip he was only gone for two short weeks and he could probably stand here all day testifying but we're gonna give him a few minutes and uh lord just bless us with faith that all things are possible if we only believe praise god i was reading a little quote on the wall in the school i work in they said if you believe you can do anything what kind of dogma is that i can't do nothing but i believe with him when all things are possible he can do everything amen so it's not about what you and i can do praise god it's about what the lord jesus is doing through us in this hour amen praise the lord what praise the lord hallelujah we have to be the joyous people in the face of the air so when you come to the house of the lord prepare to worship hallelujah our god is real this morning i'm going to read the latest scripture here john c john chapter 16 verse 22 to 24 i i i yi now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no mind take it away from you and in that day shall ask me nothing very very i say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he would give it to you hello have he asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full hallelujah i just want to give a testimony this is a i kind of shocked i my my uncle died and then he was 120 years old he was a train with my mother so i left and went to ghana for funeral when i reached there the funeral everything was fantastic what i saw is wherever i know the brethren were praying and i prayed right now with them in the middle of 40 days of prayer there is a purpose for that everybody open your mind your ear get into it uh so and ghana right now is a lot of rain so the people say oh and the ghana the way they do their funerals is is open park that's why it's not here we go inside the room no so they all the people but maybe two or three hundred people come together and support you so when i read that they said it's a lot of rain that maybe we cannot have a chance to do it and that's why i'm talking about the prayer we prayed brothers prayed brother simon prayed and when i i from accra to kumasi as soon as when i left accra there was no rain when i arrived kumasi as soon as i put my my key on my door heavy rain came that time the following day i left my village when i left my village as soon as i left kumasi to my village it rained all night to the following day my village no rain so the funeral has started and everybody thought that it's not gonna work and where we started the whole around the area everywhere was written but my place there was no raid so that's what the prayer is about and then we did two days and after sunday we went to the service we came and prepared about seven o'clock the heavy rain came down after we finished everything having rain came down and when we went miami coffee and bradford when we set up we baptize people in my village there so we set up a church and when the covert came he dismantled them so when when all the people came in their heart was into god when are we going to say wait god gonna give you somebody so wait so i spoke to them and i called my my nephew that he was drunk to death and we pray for him that time and then god helped him to stop the drinking and later on after the covenant you went back heavily drinking so i said you disgrace god he came and said sorry i said no not me you disgrace god so you have to go to god and talk to him it's not me i have nothing to do with it so when i came back here i came back here my sister called me did you pray for your nephew i said no i talked to him he said that day when you left over the night happened to that boy he was there and he said i i swallow bone i'm choking i'm choking and he vomit so bad they thought he was there they thought they have to take him to the hospital my knee said no leave him all of a sudden he was then he stood up and began to beg god to forgive him for everything that he has done he has failed him he has failed me he has failed all my uncle and stuff like that about two o'clock he cried and repented to a crook and from that time after now when is she drink he cannot touch drink anymore so god is real as you are sitting here god is real and then i think a year and a year and a half ago we went to ghana can you put a picture on there on the border yes everybody look at who is sitting down there do you know who's sitting down there who who's you brother this month sitting down there praise god see there's a baby on my laps that baby there when we went to ghana me brother coffee a young man over here called his daughter they married almost 10 years they can't have children so he he urged her daughter to come and see me and brother phillip and brother kofi so she managed to came we sat down with her we opened the bible and we talked to her and we asked her if god give you a baby you're gonna give that baby to god or you're gonna serve god he said yes then we prayed with her and we came a year a year later the baby came out so when i went there they brought that baby for me to dedicate that baby to the lord so that baby you see there that's the baby that we pray for that's what a prayer can do christian without prayer you are not a christian hallelujah if god you see the manifestation of god the bible says your joy may be full how come your joy before when you see the manifestation of the word of god imprinting your eye that's your joy you know our god is real he's eaten with everything not just to come to church when you're coming to church prepare that you are coming to receive something special for god it's time to go home these 40 days of prayer is very very important we get into it and let us all join our heart and mind and soul together even that one the one i was talking about the the the how god the people in the world saw somebody call my wife i said god listen to that daddy your husband's prayer when they came to the funeral and they were going back to the city every city around there all the funeral they were doing they couldn't make it the whole place was red accepting only that place where we did our funeral so let me tell you prayer don't don't fool around with prayer be in prayer everything that you do put god first this this gospel is real this is my testimony for you enjoy the service god bless you [Applause] [Music] praise god praise god my jesus knows just what i need [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] heaven and earth [Applause] i

to god aren't you happy this morning that you were able to gather in amen gather into the house of the lord gather into fellowship with the lord gather into fellowship with one another you know um these next four you guys thank you so much god bless you all you may be seated um we are gathered here this morning to launch a campaign called 40 days of prayer something that was created by rick warren very well known from california saddleback church has over 100 000 members worldwide um is you know has a tremendous ministry i just want to say that god bless him for his great gift of um doing what he does because he does it like nobody else he can put together information and draw things from the word of god that you know it just takes the gift of god in a dedicated life and so god bless him and his ministry and may it continue to grow for the glory of god and so today we're here first of all because you know we want to give our pastor a little opportunity to rest amen praise god but you see god knows how to do things and how to bring things together in such a perfect way that when he does it we just continue to get blessed amen over and over and over again amen so he's getting a rest he's getting blessed we're here god has given us this campaign of 40 days of prayer i believe and i know i know that you will benefit you will never be the same after these 40 days i promise you that if you dedicate yourself over these next 40 days your walk with the lord jesus christ will be different it'll be much better it'll be much closer you will be much closer to your brothers and sisters you know these last two years has been chaos god has a reason why he's put this right here at this time and you know i've just been getting so blessed in the study of it and seeing what what it is that he's going to do and how he's going to restore you know um you can go ahead and put up the first slide there um so we're gonna be talking today about 40 days of prayer this is um uh something that you will have to participate in it's entirely up to you you will get directly back what you give to it in your time your sincerity your your prayer time with the lord your fellowship with one another your attendance in the ministry in the services on the wednesday nights the sunday services and even the friday night services the prayer meetings on friday nights this has all been beautifully put together so that we can just get into such a momentum that you will build you will build i've just been doing this for the last week and i'm i'm just blown away by the momentum that's starting to build in my life amen it you will see what can happen you see you just got to know that god is real you just got to know that you know this is not a program this is not about you know about doing uh you know let's let's just throw a program into the church and let's just you know decide that you know it'll kill 40 days for us and it'll give the minister some things to talk about no no no this is not what this is all about this is this is because you are under the revelation of this hour knowing what jesus christ is doing now everything that he brings to us as as those that are revelated by the word of god has a purpose it has a dramatic purpose in your life and these next 40 days are gonna be so that we can intensely grow spiritually you need to grow spiritually you are in this human realm here and you are so distracted by the things of life the cares of this world the cares of your work your job your family your health your wealth it's constantly bombarding your mind and you are under constant oppression because of this life but god wants you now to separate for 40 days it's not that you're going to stop working you're going to keep doing all the things that you're doing but you are going to focus you are going to participate you are going to dedicate yourself you're going to make a covenant with the lord and with your brothers and sisters together that you will dedicate these next 40 days to change to spiritual growth so that you can change something in your life i don't know what's in your life right now that is really hindering you but there's something every single one of us has circumstances and situations in our lives that we need change we don't want them anymore we want to release those things we don't want them to have control over our lives anymore you might have trouble with with with you know with swearing i don't know you might have trouble with with uh relationships you know one of the greatest things about prayer and why god wants to wants you to pray is because it brings you into that relationship and you get to know how much he loves you amen amen you are going to know how much god loves you in these next 40 days we've heard about how much he loves us but it's different when you get intimate with him when you get pro when you get down and you start bringing your needs before him under a different uh revelation not just by you get up in the morning you get down on your knees say lord bless me today you know i need this i need that i need to just give him a list of things that you need meanwhile you don't even sit there long enough for him to tell you how you can get those things how you can grow how you can receive the things because sometimes we just miss it god has a way to bless you and you don't understand sometimes how he speaks because you don't listen long enough you don't stay there long enough amen praise god let's go to slide number one but before we do i want to offer up a word of prayer as we enter into this i also want to remember uh our brother gabriel lamp lemthu his wife passed away about a year ago this month okay and we just want to remember his family his children that the lord will just strengthen them and bless them and allow them to move forward and and prosper i believe that these next 40 days if they really seek the lord they will find peace in god's perfect will for their lives amen let's pray father we are so blessed this morning lord we cannot possibly even word put to words father how privileged we are as your children this morning that we can approach you the living god that's present that loves us that wants to bless us that's concerned about every little thing but lord sometimes we get so caught up in the circumstance that we just don't we don't ask we don't we don't reach we we don't we don't come to you lord and father this next 40 days father may our lives be changed as a result of this may those that are hearing out in in youtube you know that are that are tuning in father where wherever they are whoever they are lord made us such an anointing go out from these services over these next 40 days that they would receive a blessing and their lives would be changed they would be delivered they would see life differently they would find peace and happiness and not be so caught up with the circumstances of this world lord meet every need remember our pastor strengthen him encourage him his family his wife lord just prosper them in a supernatural way we pray grant it now in jesus name amen and amen praise god so you know um we look here at the scripture in ephesians chapter 4 verse 14. it says now these are different versions of the scripture and how it's read but you will see that there's truth there we are not meant to remain as children at the mercy of every chance wind of teaching instead we are meant to hold firmly to the truth in love and grow up every way into christ we're not to remain as children listen you know if you are an adult today and you're still a child that's never grown up that's a sad condition to be in if you're a spiritual child in christ that's one thing that you've just come to christ but there is no way that you can remain that way you have to grow you have to spiritually grow there has to be spiritual growth you know because because if you don't grow you don't mature you see your children right we've all been through it we see them go through certain stages when they come to us you know when they're asking for things they just they just blame ass they don't know what's good for them they don't have any idea they could ask for a for for the for a super sharp knife that's on the wall that you use for hunting dad i want to play with that obviously you're not going to give it to them but they don't know they don't understand they're still children as they grow they start to develop you know certain attitudes and then they have certain desires and then they want to make certain decisions and you know as teenagers you know i i like i'm just going to say it the way it is when i was 16 i was really stupid i made a lot of stupid decisions when my dad said no don't do it i said i'm gonna do it and i paid the price and you can go back in your own life you know when you when you start to get more mature and you grow up then that maturity causes you to make the right decisions you know how to approach situations you don't make dumb decisions because that's a result of immaturity and that's what's happened with a lot of people they make stupid dumbest decisions while even serving the lord it's because they're immature but you're going to have an opportunity to spiritually grow in so many ways over these next 40 days that you will be immensely blessed let's go to slide number two the bible tells us that growth is god's will for your life babies are cute kids are cute but a child that doesn't grow up that's not cute amen you still got a lot of listen we're living in a world right now you go into some homes and you know the parents are 70 years old and they still got 35 year old children kids acting like spoiled brats why because they haven't grown up they haven't matured they're staying in a state of mind in a state of in a condition in their mind because they're they're they're being stubborn they don't want to grow they don't want to do the things that are necessary in order to develop properly disciplined new habits so that things can get better you know you're a creature of habit amen it is impossible to grow old it is possible to grow old and never grow up but our title today is do you want to grow up are you looking to grow maturely you know into into a walk with god that that's going to enhance everything around your life i mean everything you can change your health you can change your your relationships you can change your your your financial position you can change all these things if you truly sincerely focus over these next 40 days amen you want to be a really strong spiritually strong man or woman then listen to the things that you will be taught over these next 40 days participate amen growth is god's will ephesians chapter 4 there on your on the outline at the top verse 14 says we are not meant to remain as children at the mercy of every wind of teaching in other words you just fall for anything when you're immature instead we're meant to hold firmly to the truth in love and to grow up in every way into christ we're not meant to remain as children but we're meant to grow up i want you to circle the word grow up in your mind circle it right now visually grow up amen what is the perfect picture of maturity look at jesus jesus is the ultimate picture of spiritual emotional intellectual maturity to have the thoughts of christ and know how to respond like he did will be a whole lot better in your life wow what a powerful thing that you would be able to deal with circumstances and situations the way that jesus would you know when jesus was on the earth the jews they were hearing oh the messiah is coming messiah is coming but messiah is supposed to come and destroy this this this government the romans destroy them they got carried away they started to think that you know that th that all the governments had conspiracies uh on them and and that and that and that that they were gonna get wiped out and yes all those things all those conspiracies all those listen this world these governments go back to the scripture jesus went into the wilderness for 40 days and he met face to face with satan and satan told him to bow before him that if he would bow before him he'd give him all the kingdoms of the world he says they're mine i'll give them to you if you bow before jesus said get behind me satan what are you talking about but he is like let's just tell it the way it is all the governments and all the oh listen they're trying to do the best that they can but let me tell you who's behind it all right the bible says he's the he's the god of this evil age he rules the governments he's controlling the governments you know that but you as a son or a daughter of god should not be getting caught up into that because your position is not to do with anything with them your position as a son or a daughter of god in this world is to feed on the word of god and allow the word to fulfill its purpose in your life you've got a supernatural calling upon your life as a son or a daughter of god people are getting caught up with the vaccine they become anti-vaxxers to the point where even the churches even the churches in this message imagine they're getting caught up into the government situations the controls the systems of this world thinking oh well we're not gonna we aren't taking the vaccine what the heck's the difference between the vaccine and a tetanus shot will somebody tell me yeah there's a there's a virus so they got a vaccine for the virus brother brown says vaccine virus take the vaccine he had to do certain things when he went on trips you know my my one of my motives for forgetting it was because i want to travel i don't want to be bound by nothing if god wants to allow me to travel i'm going to travel i'm not going to be controlled by any government and so if i need a vaccine i don't fear any vaccine if you're a son or a daughter of god you shouldn't fear anything like that [Applause] why would you fear it but i'm not also going out there and every single person that i see you've got no vaccine you're gonna die what business what all of a sudden i'm god that i can tell that i can tell who's going to die and who's not going to die come on saints let's get let's we want to mature here we want to grow up we don't want to get caught up into these these circumstances about the vaccine or no vaccine or i'm not taking it you're not taking it listen we're saying that there's still sons and daughters of god out there the government is saying you need to take the vaccine take it amen what's the big deal if you're a son or a daughter of god you should not fear any of that you want to move on with the program of god because there's people who still need to come into the household of faith okay if they want to come here they got to get vaccinated but if they're really revelated by the word of god they don't fear any of that they know that nothing can take them only god he's purposed a season a time and a season for all things in your life has a time and a season a time to live and a time to die but we're in the time for the rapture hallelujah that's what we're feeding on that's what we're concerned about amen we're we're we're the rapture we're the people that are getting rapture ready by the word of god we're not getting caught up in any of this stuff we're gonna carry on with the program of god it's going to come fresh every sunday every wednesday every friday it's going to come fresh because god is welcome in our meetings and there are no lines he is god he is the leader he is our our divine healer our provider he does all things we're going to press on amen praise god those jews that went ahead when jesus was here they came to him and said lord you're you're supposed to destroy all of this he said love your enemy he says there's a time and a season for all things you just don't know what time it is you don't know who you're talking to you don't even realize who's standing here you think that i'm here and you're trying to tell me what it's supposed to be he was god in human flesh here on the earth he came for a purpose amen praise god hallelujah what happened to those jews they all got messed up a lot of them got killed a lot of them got so caught up into the things of the world they got snared by all the controversies by all the all the different uh you know um things that they're saying and oh we're gonna be put into concentration camps they're gonna they're you know they're injecting us with these things oh my god i don't want to hear it anymore it has nothing to do with us we're in the world but we're not of the world we are walking with god through a pandemic but we walk with god and if you're walking with him what do you fear why would you fear amen praise god forevermore hallelujah uh but you know in in this coming week in these next 40 days you want to understand the purpose behind it and you want to understand that there are laws of spiritual growth and that you have to understand these laws of spiritual growth and what is required of you to spiritually grow there's laws that control the universe there's the law of gravity these are laws that were placed here for a purpose and as long as you are in this thing here you're going to have to bring it under obedience to the laws of god's word amen you're going to do your best and you're going to let god do the rest because as a human being you you you can't do everything that god requires of you so don't think that you are invincible in that you know in this human flesh here you're still you're still susceptible to all the things that go on out there okay you got to be careful you got to make the right decisions you're still under free moral agency to make certain decisions but i'm hoping that for the next 40 days and that it's going to create such a habit in you that it is going to change your life forever and bring you into a closer walk with god that you will do these things amen praise god you know god has a way if you want to grow you've got to cooperate with these laws it's just it's in the word you're going to see it it's all over the word at the end of the service today you're going to receive a handout which you know basically outlines and covers the things that that that we're going to cover here um over this next hour or so amen slide number three it says we are not go back okay next slide sorry so we grow when we feed on god's word amen we grow when we feed on god's word this book right here is your soul food you need to feed on this every single day you don't just come in here on sunday and decide oh that's good enough no sir it ain't good enough that ain't gonna be even close to good enough can you imagine that you just all you do is you go eat one day sunday you go to a big buffet you fill yourself and then you don't eat for the rest of the week good luck you're going to have all kinds of of health issues but you need to eat a little every day you need to feed every day on the word of god amen praise god every single day slide number four matthew 4 4 jesus says people need more than bread for their life they need bread and a little bit of tuna with it is that what it says no it says you need the bread of god's word you need god's word you need to feed constantly he says people need more than bread for their life they must feed on the word of god that's what god wants you to do is to feed on it a little bit every single day amen glory to god we want to help you develop that habit through these next 40 days that's what we want to do we want you to understand that you're going to need to feed every single day on god's word amen and notice all the blessings that god has for his people come from you feeding on the word of grace amen would you like to have all the blessings that god has for you you know as your brother your friend your spiritual coach one of your spiritual coaches we've got our pastor we've got other brothers here administering brothers we want you to have uh uh you know uh all the blessings that god has for you we want you to we want you to to benefit from every aspect of these next 40 days and so you're going to need to participate you're going to need to be a part of it you know there are some gifts that god wants to give you but he's waiting for you to grow up before he gives them to you it's like our children we can't be giving them certain gifts when they're too young but as they mature and they get older then you know we start to receive you know we start to put things into their hand knowing that they're mature enough to handle the gifts that we give them well god wants to activate your gifts he wants to activate your position in the body of christ we all have a position in the word of god and we need to find it but how we find it is by feeding on the word participating in the word hearing the word and receiving the faith that activates the word in you amen so number five the word of grace is able to build you up and give you all blessings that god has for his people so it's important for you to feed now if you come here on sunday and you feed on the word guess what if that's all you do 95 of everything that i'm saying up here by wednesday night you're going to forget it that's just a fact because you have to do more than just one service one sermon you've got to build momentum that's what we're doing here these next 40 days are for you to build momentum so that you don't just forget you know in the first 72 hours you know everything that you were preached on sunday that's pretty depressing for the pastor you know that to know that you know if his people are not doing something on a daily basis to continue to feed on the word and and and have that relationship with god that within 72 hours all the time and the effort that he put in you know put into putting together that sermon that within 72 hours 95 of it is going to be gone from the minds of his people and so that's why over these next 40 days you're going to receive for those that of you that want it this 40 days of prayer workbook and it's it's it's phenomenal okay you need to have one of these if you're going to participate in the full program because it's connected to the friday night prayer meetings there's going to be teachings on there there'll be short teachings it's it's connected to you developing some some small groups you know like through you know you can zoom you know you you just choose a few you know like maybe five or six or seven of you that you that you normally associate with that you fellowship with and and use it now to bring your group together maybe once a week you know through a zoom meeting you don't have to get together at your homes but through a zoom meeting to just come together and just read through the the that week's little teaching that that week's little program and then you can actually even watch you know uh videos you can go online because rick warren has all those those little teachings he has them with very short 28-minute videos where he just shares his thoughts and goes through that and so don't be afraid don't think oh i'm not listening to him i'll listen to my pastor i'll listen to the brothers no listen you need to listen to the word amen you need to know that god has given you the spirit of revelation to discern and take from the word everything that you have need of no matter where you receive it from it's irrelevant you can be driving down the road and the truck says one way only and god could speak to you right through that one-way trucking lord your way is the way i want to go i want your way to be my way you see what i mean god can speak in any time any season and through anybody that's the thing that a lot of people are missing out and they're missing the program of god the continuation of god in this message god is progressing in this word and there's a lot of people they're not willing they're thinking that oh they're going off here they're going off there meanwhile it's christ moving in the power of revelation leading and guiding and these people that think that we're going off are being left behind i'm not going to say who or what or that's i don't even care who how what it's not it's irrelevant i love my brothers and my sisters i will continue to love them i will jesus said love everyone everything don't get he said love your enemy so if you're going to love your enemy you might as well love anybody else or anything else don't in other words don't get caught up with these tensions and these differences get caught up with the word let the love of god so fill you and penetrate your life not to be wishy-washy when you need to correct you've got to correct when you need to be corrected you are going to be corrected and you need to know how to take correction when god gives it it's for your good especially when you can take it back and you can see it's the truth pride will get in the way pride is always there just before you're gonna fall remember that so when you get all excited you get all puffed up i gotta be careful because of the position that i hold in in my business you know sometimes you you get tired you get overwhelmed you know you're going seven days a week 14 hours a day and situations start getting on your nerves you can't help it because you're you're still human and you got to watch that spirit of pride because it'll try to raise up it'll try to make you something and then the holy spirit says i will deal with this and when you can just stop and and say thank you lord and walk away from it he's your partner you're in constant prayer with him you're constantly communicating i don't know about you every single day every day constantly i'm just lord i'm going into this meeting now this guy i had to deal with it i i was dealing on a with an on an offer this week that was i'm telling you i have never dealt in a real estate transaction like this since i started real estate and i'm talking it tested every side of me i'm not kidding you i had to walk i had to stop my thoughts stop my my mouth stop when i the minute i would wanted to that i wanted to say something because this seller i was representing the buyer and this seller oh man anointed but every time that i that something would come i'd say you know he's a good businessman and he's he's trying to negotiate the best deal that's what i say i tell my clients i said he's you know what he's a shrewd businessman and he's going to go for whatever he can get and then i'd say lord deal with them that's all i had to do we got the deal because god is real i am never ever going to doubt his end result if the deal failed it failed because i tell my clients listen that was not for you that's why you didn't get it but i can promise you the one that's coming you're gonna love it'll be the right one and i'm telling you god is my witness it's the grace of god but it happens almost every time i see the supernatural constantly because we walk with god we believe that he is in control we have a relationship we can pray every day in the right way and god honors that especially if you're doing it totally reliant upon him and lord you've given me the ability you've given me this ability you've given me this negotiating ability you've given me this discipline to be to to to hold steady to to to not lose my temper lord you've given me all these things and i'm gonna i want to please you i want to serve you in the best way that i possibly can because i know that next week we we could be gone all of us we could be gone so all we want to do is have that right relationship so that when we go we can we can just exit with no baggage you're still human though you still got to recognize you got faults you're still going to make mistakes you're still gonna be disappointed you're still gonna you're still gonna get mad you're still gonna all these things but but in the back you either believe god or you don't and when you believe god through it all you're going to stand right back up and you're going to say god's will be done hallelujah glory to god amen next slide so a daily time with god is going to be one of the action steps that you're going to have to take for these next 40 days now i know you all pray i know you do you might say oh brother day i pray every day you're going to pray different by the time we move through this series you're going to have a different approach you're going to be a little bit more mature in the way that you pray you're going to realize that there was a lot of immaturity in the way that you prayed because we're creatures of habit amen we are we are designed in a certain way that you know that we we just we just habitually do things go to the next slide but you know there's there's something about how we grow and how we learn and we learn in different ways and so if you go to the next slide you know god made us all unique god made us all different god made us in a certain way that you know that we need to understand you know our human limitations and strengths and that's what this is all designed to do is to just bring priorities in place so that you'll know how to properly grow in christ and so the first way that people learn is by listening and those are the kind of people that love church they come into church and they listen and they hear and they say amen i got it hallelujah and then there's those that learn by watching they need to watch they need that's why we put these up there you know and you're gonna receive certain um you know uh pamphlets when you leave uh and and and you're gonna be able to read them and so you will absorb because you watch you might watch the video i'm big on that i'm big on watching and learning okay there's a few ways that i noticed it because this got me to you know kind of focus in how it is that i grow and then there's some that learn by talking you'll notice that those are you know like if you get into a small group discussion the one that talks a lot he's learning from his talking he's hearing he's hearing certain things and until he speaks it he doesn't really get it it's just the way people are certain people are built they might see it they might hear it they might watch it but until they actually speak it it doesn't register in their minds so you need to so that's why it's important for you to fellowship fellowship with one another because as you fellowship with one another and you talk to one another it releases the the the way that god has designed you to receive his word and then there's those that learn by doing it you know there's some people they don't like to listen they don't like to watch and they don't like to talk that's men in general not all of them but they're doers they get in get underneath that hood lift that engine up that carburetor is not sounding right before you know it's 20 pieces on the floor and it's all back together again and she's running just right because they're doers they got to get into action but this next 40 days is going to get you to activate all those areas so that you will benefit in the way that god has designed you to grow and to pray and to have that relationship with christ and one another it's going to get you to see one another differently to look at one understand one another you know on how each of us live and learn and grow together amen different styles of learning you know some of you are auditory some of you learn by listening some of you learn by watching some of you learn by doing and some of you learn by seeing now let's go to the next slide we grow when we develop spiritual habits let's face it you can just kind of look at yourself and look at your habits and look at the results there's a saying that say you know it says you continue doing what you're doing you will continue to get what you got it's as simple as that and so in order for you to change certain things in your walk with god in your spiritual relationship with god and one another you will need to change your habits you will need to develop new spiritual habits some people they just are hard-headed and they don't want to change you need a body change so you better start saying amen to change you know like some people like they just don't like change period you know you get an argument every time you want to just you know you want to can we make this yellow i don't like yellow right away the thing comes up you know and anger and this and that meanwhile you're just suggesting something can we talk about this can we communicate you know but you got to watch that if you if you're in this habit that you don't like change you're you're going to be hard people stay people stay in churches for 20 years and they never change they have this stubborn attitude regardless whatever the situation whatever the first the first thing is you will you will sense it you will feel it there's there's resistance how can you resist change when god is trying to change you daily that's the whole process he's trying to develop the right habits in you so that you can become what he wants you to be amen you know uh we cannot overestimate estimate with you the importance of you building good habits in your life if you build good habits in your life you're going to you're going to have good character if you have good character you're going to have a great destiny your habits determine what you are and what you are determines where you go in life your character is the sum total of your habits amen you can't stay for instance i'm a kind person you know i i i have the character quality of kindness unless you're always kind unless it's habitual to you it's your habit to be kind if you're only kind 25 of the time you're not kind period if you're only kind when you want something you're not kind o honey i'll be faithful for you to you for 29 days a month you're not faithful it's that simple so it's not it's it's a matter of understanding that it's not 25 of the time it's developing a habit that is 100 consistent and disciplined no matter what if it's only two or three things that you can develop over these next 40 days then let that be those fear those few things because i'll tell you something it takes at least six weeks to develop a new habit that's why this is 40 days 6 times 7 42 days it takes you three weeks just to get a little bit comfortable with it and then another three weeks to actually make it a habit desmond has a habit of being joyful everybody knows that don't try to change that the joy of the lord is your strength there's a scripture in the word he's made it a habit to be joyful no matter what and there's strength that comes from that and if i know that in the word of god i'm gonna take that i'm gonna look at it i'm gonna say praise god i i want some of that i want the joy of the lord i want his strength in my life if it means developing a certain habit then i want to develop that habit i want to be somebody that's always approachable that's a habit you don't want to be the kind of person that you can approach them on sunday but you can't approach them on monday or friday you ever notice friday it was easy to talk to the boss because you knew you didn't have to see him for the next three days you see it's it's it's like you got to get it right you are or you're not you either believe the word or you don't it's just as simple as that uh we better move along here uh slide number 10 the scripture says here in john chapter 13 verse 17 jesus says now that you know these things you will be blessed if you i want you to circle the next two words practice them there it is in the word of god you've got to practice certain things in order to develop the habit to do those things amen praise god and so you don't get god's blessings from knowing the right thing to do you get god's blessings for doing the right thing it's one thing to know oh i know this i know that but you don't do it it's no good to you unless you hear recognize and act there's no power in it there's no benefit from it amen praise god and so the way you build any habit in your life is in two ways through repetition and through practice repetition and practice you ever see an athlete they become athletes because they are disciplined to habitually do certain things regardless every single day they'll do it over and over and over again and they become olympic athletes you ever watch successful people they have certain habits they have habits on the way that they act the way that they communicate the way that they handle themselves the way that they show confidence and respect and all of those things there's a way to be successful in this world you you will not always deal with the with with with the most honest people and you will not always be under the greatest of circumstances but you don't have to change you can still be that same person you can still be truthful you can still tell the truth you can still be a person of integrity so that they will get to know this person is consistently somebody that we can trust because he's got the habit of saying the truth you see these are all examples it needs to become ingrained in your life over these next 40 days whatever it is you're gonna know you're gonna you're gonna take your own inventory you're gonna see where it is that you need new habits old habits kicked out new habits developed amen next slide some of you had habits in the past you dropped them off this is a time to go back to what god wants to do in you he says now that you know these things you'll be blessed if you practice them what happens when you practice good habits spiritual habits you grow it's that simple you grow but you see solid food is for mature people whose minds notice have been trained to practice that's called habit whose minds have been trained by practice to know the difference between good and evil see these are all scriptures right out of the word of god we read them all the time god is interested in your habits god wants you to develop some new habits amen you have to set up habits and be disciplined and do it so you need to literally you know that's what this this workbook is going to be good for you're going to be able to evaluate yourself look at certain things make some notes and study and and and work on those things 5 10 15 minutes a day that's all it's going to take but it will powerfully change your life amen hallelujah next slide the bible says in first corinthians all good athletes train hard and practice to get better they do it to win a prize that won't last but you you practice to win a prize that will last into eternity hallelujah first corinthians 9 25 you know they worked so hard to win that prize so that they can pin it right here what good is that going to do when they cross over to meet the lord unless they've got the character unless they've got that relationship with the lord unless they have something real you've got something eternal that you will benefit from these next 40 days it will enhance your walk with god it will enhance your relationship with one another so we're gonna have you know uh these friday night prayer meetings i don't know is everybody getting the emails okay because like i sent i i think there's a lot of people not getting them i sent out an email about a week and a half ago to people and i said if you're if you want to continue to get these emails please respond back i think i got 15. so either you guys are all backslidden i don't know or you're not getting the emails so i'm just saying these are things you got certain habits you don't like to respond you don't like to whatever you need to change some habits because part of responding is communication and when you don't communicate with your heavenly father or your brothers and sisters with respectful courtesy it shows you need a habit change i don't care what you think okay i don't know i don't like technology this and i don't care if you don't like technology you can phone you still use a phone right you can call you can reach you can this next 40 days is going to require communication you're going to see it you're going to you're going to see how much we actually get into that how important it is how how much of an importance it is for us to respond and to communicate and to know that it's very important amen the next slide says if there was any verse in the bible okay that that that we would want is this every day the believers had the habit of meeting together in the temple courts to worship together and also in their homes for fellowship they ate together and celebrated with happy and thankful hearts that was something that the disciples in the books in the book of acts they didn't do it on sundays only they did it every single day they had communication they reached out to one another i i gotta say you know there's a lot of brothers and sisters they reach out they communicate with me and and i love it i love it you know they'll send me a text say brother you know pray for me on this situation brother this thing happened they say i'm so blessed i said praise god i'll respond back and say god is good you know there's because because we are encouraging one another sometimes they're down and they need to be encouraged back up again we are there for one another unless we understand how important that is it's the body of christ it's how the body is operating if listen these these last two years have done one thing the best separate getting people to totally separate from each other discommunicate no contact whatsoever to the point where when you even see them it's like hey like it's it's just gotten to a place where where it like like you're losing your first love you want that first love back again you want to get it back into your life into your relationships into everything that you do you want to project the love of god into that situation so that god can take a hold of it and do miracles he does miracles i don't care if it's something at work brother gabriel that next door neighbor you love him till till he's got to give whatever it is that god got released from him it's that simple because we serve a supernatural god we heard the testimony brother desmond there in africa the woman couldn't have a child it's not because brother desmond is because he's got faith in god and he knows that god can do it and so the first thing he says well come here let's pray let me lay hands on you i believe god's word that if you have faith in your heart that god can give you a child he's going to give it to you that's faith and that's something that's available to every son and every daughter of god because you believe god hallelujah daily time alone with god it's so important you know daily time alone and fellowship very important all those aspects go to the next slide in the bible it says in the book of joshua chapter 1 verse 8 next slide please always remember what is written in this book read it and think about it every day and be sure to obey everything written in it if you do this you will be prosperous and successful in your life so why wouldn't we want to do these things why wouldn't we want to take time every single day to just believe god's word and not believe the circumstances in our lives they are there the bills do come in every month the children do act up there's health issues there's you know relationship those are all real things but there's nothing too hard for god if you are willing over the next 40 days to commit to god your time your few minutes every day your time to read your time to come into the services your time to attend the prayer meetings your time to have a little small group fellowship with one another to develop your relationships to develop and pray for one another to help one another to lift one up that's weak and to and to receive from him that's strong if you're willing to do that you will benefit you will be successful if you apply all of these things okay amen so you think god's lying god think god's just teasing you you think god's just making this up no god says you want to be prosperous you want to be successful well you're not doing what will be the key to it this is the owner's manual for life and if you do this you'll make a whole lot fewer mistakes if you read it you study it you memorize it and you get it he says i promise you i promise you you will succeed in your life you want to succeed in your business you need to read it reflect on it remember it you need to do all these habits that we're just talking about right here all right next slide we grow when we help each other grow next slide please we grow when we help each other to grow we need to know that you know paul says here in um no next slide paul says here in the book of romans i want us to help each other with the faith we have your faith will help me and my faith will help you it's it's the truth if i've got certain faith in certain areas and you feel like you know that oh brother danny can help me in this area and a lot of you do that you reach out and when i need i reach out it's a good thing because we help we encourage we we strengthen one another we support one another we know our strengths and our weaknesses and we build up each other we need to know that we grow when we help each other grow this is not a one-way street this is not just about me or just about you it's about the body of christ we're we're coming together here it's so important love one another care for one another help one another encourage one another pray for one another you can't do it in a crowd like this you serve one another share with one another build each other up be there for each other on and on 56 times god says the only way to grow is in community the only way to grow is in relationships so you don't do it while you're here sitting in a sermon you you do it when you interact with one another in fellowship and you cross each other's paths and you greet one another even if it's for 30 seconds just to say hey how's your week you know did you have a great week well you know what god bless you have a wonderful week may the lord you know you know reach out if there's anything that you know that that you get blessed i want to hear some testimonies i want to hear you know communicate choose use use each other to to to to build each other to strengthen and encourage one another amen praise god hallelujah i can't say to the foot i don't need you and the car can't say and the ear can't say to the eye i don't need you and the body of christ one part can't say i don't need you a hand served from the body of christ is worthless you take a hand and you severed that hand and you threw it over there what is that hand gonna do it's gonna wither it's gonna rot you need to be a part of a community you people out there in youtube land you need to know that you know oh i don't need to go to church you know you do need to go to church you need to fellowship with brothers and sisters that are like-minded that believe the word of god you need to strengthen one another encourage one another you need to have fellowship with one another you want to be alone out there you want to be a lone ranger oh well i believe this so i'm going to stay out here good for you good luck let me know when you need a drink of water there's still a drink right here right here hallelujah we need one another amen and we should love and i'm talking really love one another that's powerful saints it changes everything start to project love to that individual that you feel a little tension from just project hit just project love to that thing and you will see that the enemy that is between you and that person or you and that situation starts to dissolve and the power of god comes in and then god's grace takes over things start to change things just they cannot remain the same hallelujah and if that person cannot take it and that person cannot submit then don't worry god will probably take them out it's just the way the body works you know when when things get in there like antibodies you know if there's certain things that are getting into your body that that that you you know you just go and eat something that's not right it's not too long you're visiting the men's room or the ladies room right because your body knows how to kick it out well god knows every single one as they mature now because this is a this is a maturity time we're at the end of the end don't be surprised when you see certain things happen certain com certain goal don't be surprised by that every one everything must find its rightful position in the body or outside the body because remember the body the rapture it's only the body of christ that goes in the rapture okay so anything that's not supposed to be there will not be there god has a way of doing things you don't have to be fearful you don't have to worry but you still need to love them you still need to project the love of god you still need once in a while to say hey god bless you trust in all is well you still need to be there for them if they reach out we still need to pray for one another we still need to listen this is not like you know god isn't putting boundaries on his love he's not putting boundaries on the way that he wants to build this body because he's doing it and if you trust him then he'll do it and he'll do it perfectly hallelujah glory to god i'm going to just move ahead here my priorities not your priorities it's all about me we need each other it's not your priorities my priorities about us it's about the body it's about edifying nourishing strengthening building up the body of jesus christ next slide says in hebrews 10 24 he says let us be concerned for one another to help one another to show love and to do good let us not give up the habit of meeting together as some are doing instead let us encourage one another all the more let's not give up the habit of meeting together as summer doing let's let's let's get back into the habit of fellowshipping of of of you know calling one another you know you sisters you need to reach out to the other sisters on a regular basis you need to create the habit of doing that it it's every time my wife tells me about a fellowship that she had with sister june or sister elaine or sister so-and-so sister deborah sister you know a man she gets into you know little fellowship says she's always strengthened from those fellowships she's different we need to get into the habit of reaching out to one another just to say hey how's it going god bless you you know how's your week going not to gossip be careful of that oh did you hear this that's the only reason they're calling oh larry she's calling i know why she's calling i know why he's calling right as soon as something raises up right away no this you you if you're in the habit of of reaching out to one another sending out a little amen god bless you you know amanda there she sends out god bless your thursday god bless your sunday once in a while i don't see them all the time but whenever i do i thank god for them because i said praise god there's a blessing for me today and right away god bless you and your sist you and your family sister and brothers reach out in this one sense and that one sense they have the spirit of fellowship on them they understand that they need each other that we need one another that with community we can grow together next you know we need to get desperate sometimes in our situations you know notice what the bible says here also in james 16 5 16 said if you're confessing our faults getting right making ready for it confess our faults one to another having no no faults ask people to pray for you confessing our faults one to another this brother brown saying praying one for the other there you are with love love that i got confidence i can confess to you my wrong and you can confess to me you're wrong and i love you well enough that i'll pray for you and you'll pray for me and will stay with it with effectual fervent prayer until it's answered that's that's desperation that's what we should have all the time if there's a brother or sister or a situation we should immediately listen those prayer requests when they come out with brother bill he sends them out i know a lot of you you just look at it and you just go on with your day i know it it doesn't take long for you to read that and say lord just remember her right now remember him right now and move on that's all do you think that it oh lord jesus this brother lord i know what he's been doing and i know he deserves this but lord jesus oh god you know this has happened in this you hear that you look at the prayer requests and you you got the wrong habit up here oh you know what serves them right what kind of a demon is on you what kind of a spirit would think in that way in the body of christ you've got to get on your knees and you've got to get right you've got to get something out of you you need to change your habits you need to change your stinking thinking you need to you know do things and and and and and love one another in it you know change how you're seeing one another i hope after today you will look at one another different you will feel different you will know that you are a son of god that that is a son or a daughter of god that you are working together to get this work done for his glory that we are not here to separate we are here to come together in the unity of the faith so that we can do what needs to be done for the glory of god it's all about your attitude let's move on action step is to join a small group and to attend the friday night prayer meetings and start a small group and by saying that like i said like don't make it anything super you know difficult and everything else just reach out to a couple of people you know a couple of sisters and say hey let's let's just get together let's talk let's you know let's do a zoom meeting there's a few that can do zoom meetings and just you know read that thing for 15 20 minutes share each other talk between one another share some testimonies and and allow the holy spirit to bless under this umbrella of the 40 days of prayer here i'm talking about this is going to change your habits this is what's going to cause you to make those those changes amen praise god move on to the next slide we grow when we expect to grow you've got to be under expectation that god is going to do what you are asking him to do come on saints next slide you know uh for instance many times there are people come in the prayer line and i pray for them i never know what's going to happen i just pray for them and there is a power in prayer prayer will even change the word of god that was a striker wasn't it but it's the truth the word of the lord would you not believe the prophets the word of the lord came to isaiah and he went and told hezekiah that he wasn't coming off his bed he was going to die and hezekiah turned his face to the wall and wept bitterly and said lord i beseech thee i've walked before thee with a perfect heart and desire 15 more years of life and the prophet wasn't gone till the word of the lord came again to the prophet said go tell him i heard his prayer and he's coming off the bed in the next three days prayer changes things [Music] because we expect we get into desperation we know that god can do it and so you've got to put yourself under the expectation that he's going to do it you've got to get desperate you've got to go to god and say lord jesus quote his word remind him of certain promises in his word and if you've kept your promises if you're doing what you know you can do all that you do then stand god will do the rest every time god moves out of heaven and moves on earth he does a miracle in somebody's life is because somebody believed somebody believed oh glory to god and the question i ask you if you haven't even thought about it until now is what are you going to expect to happen in your life in the next 40 days we're winding it down let the musicians come what are you expecting because if you haven't thought about it that's why this workbook is going to give you an opportunity to write these things down and then you'll be able to go back and you'll be able to see the things that have changed in your life you'll be able to go back and review those things and see how god has literally changed those things and it's all because you expected it next slide we grow when we commit to grow remember this is going to take a commitment this week it's going to start today you're going to make that commitment today to god and to one another that you will choose growth that will be your choice spiritual growth is not automatic as i said you can grow older without growing up growing is not automatic it's a choice you must choose to grow you must choose to allow habits to change in your life you must choose to step out and do things that you normally haven't been doing so that change can take place it's going to take discipline next slide i go back to the question which is the title of this message do you really want to grow you'll find me when you get serious about finding me and want it more than anything else if you want it more than anything else pick something saints if it's only one thing don't make it too difficult for yourself you know your habits you know that you're maybe you're a procrastinator and you know it takes you an hour to get something that should take one minute to do takes you two days to do certain things that takes you two minutes to do you're gonna need to commit and you're gonna need to do it you're gonna need to seriously seek him and you will find when we say god i have to grow i'm tired of being a spiritual baby i don't like being manipulated by my moods by the opinions of others i don't like being a people pleaser i don't like the fears and anxieties and worries i don't like the depression i don't like the problems i have with anger i don't like the the i don't like all these things god i want to grow up i want to be a woman of god i want to be a man of god i want to man up and be strong and steady and stable well that's a choice that you need to commit to here today next slide you've got a covenant with others i want you to choose somebody it could be your husband it could be your wife it could be your brother could be your sister somebody that you have confidence that you can go to and maybe confess some things that you know you don't have to get into heavy detail but certain things that you want changed in your life and you're gonna say brother i'm covenant with you that i'm gonna pray for your needs and you're going to pray for mine and together over these next 40 days we're gonna we're gonna we're we're gonna achieve things that we never thought was possible for god's glory for god's glory amen a covenant we grow faster when we make a decision with other people and we do it in community together because we trust we have confidence amen praise god now this is a covenant that i'm going to encourage us to do here today when you go home tonight i want you to write it out i so and so make a covenant with you lord that i will take these next 40 days and work on this and that and change this habit and that habit because i really want to change if you believe that with everything that's in you what i just said you watch the supernatural start from the moment you drop that pen you will see god in every thing you'll just start to recognize wow this is real why not because i said so but because you believe so you know you you know he's god you know he's able to do it you know it hallelujah next slide our greatest wish and power is that you will become mature christians god wants you to grow god wants you to mature god wants to use you in order to bring the rapture into its final stage that's what this is all about you're gonna you're you're gonna see the greater picture here this is not just about building a prayer relationship with god and your s and your brothers and sisters this is about the power of god coming into the body with that capstone of love and bringing such an anointing and such a brother brahm said that one morning he says you're gonna feel the love of god sweep over you like you've never felt before and something and you're going to get so caught away in the moment in the twinkling of an eye it'll be over but that is something that you're going to be conscious of you need to become part of that program you need to you need to get into that revelation the the rapture is a revelation remember that and so you're gonna need to feed on the word feed on the on the prophet listen to the messages everything that you now listen to and read you watch it'll bring you back to this it'll bring you back to it'll it'll remind you of certain habits it'll remind you of certain things that you're doing that you are doing because you know over these last few days i i looked at certain habits that i had and i and i realized you know their habits that do produce good results i look at the habits of my partner frank you know i was watching he's got certain habits that man he does not compromise for a second on it and because of that and sometimes i you know i like you know i get a little bit okay all right do it you know it's got you know but at the end it worked it it's because he knows that if he does this over and over and over again it'll produce the right result and it's positive and so by doing that becoming conscious of that we can do the same thing now in whatever it is that we want to change just make it a habit decide that no matter what know that god wants you to grow so are you expecting the rapture saints are you really expecting a body change the lord wants you to grow up the question is do you want to grow up because if you grow up you go up god bless you saints [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes yeah we are going to be here on wednesday night um we're going to have our media team here for those of you that want to come you should have received an
