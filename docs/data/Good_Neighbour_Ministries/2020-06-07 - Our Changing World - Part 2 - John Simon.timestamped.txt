[2:08] they are made on this spirit Lord reach
[2:12] out and take a hold of some life some
[2:16] heart someone to recognize their day and
[2:20] their message and they are in which
[2:23] we're living to see be all the glory and
[2:26] the praise in Jesus name Amen
[2:30] it's good to be here today friends and
[2:34] to our subject
[2:37] last week we spoke on part one of our
[2:43] changing world and
[2:46] there I stressed that right before our
[2:51] very eyes our times are changing
[2:57] we
[2:58] documented or we traced or followed this
[3:03] change
[3:04] from the time of Adam and Eve
[3:08] when they lived in the dispensation of
[3:12] innocence living innocently in the
[3:16] garden but then with the
[3:19] coming of the serpent with his seductive
[3:22] powers on the scene it changed from
[3:26] innocence to men with his conscience
[3:32] then Noah followed up and the
[3:37] dispensation
[3:39] changed from conscience to human
[3:42] government not to detail every change
[3:46] but we'll go to the change in the times
[3:50] of Jesus
[3:51] when Jesus arrives on the scene to bring
[3:56] about a change from law with its
[4:00] legalisms condemnations and judgments
[4:04] took grace the day of grace so Jesus was
[4:10] the one they're changing law to grace
[4:15] now certainly friends we can also see
[4:18] Luther coming on the scene and it change
[4:23] from the all paganistic
[4:26] traditional religion of Rome
[4:32] right to
[4:34] the faith of our fathers
[4:39] the return of the true faith
[4:43] in just a little bud
[4:46] just a little glimmer of light
[4:49] came forth in the time of Luther and
[4:55] it traveled down
[4:58] pastor Wesley came to the times of the
[5:01] great Pentecostal revival when the great
[5:05] Holy Spirit of Almighty God was poured
[5:08] out upon every nation on earth under the
[5:11] Sun as it was in acts 2 there we find
[5:16] brethren at the same time there came
[5:20] upon the scene a great messenger of that
[5:25] in the time and day of that Pentecostal
[5:30] revival never had a light shine so
[5:33] bright from the pains of Jesus Christ
[5:37] himself never had a light shined upon us
[5:41] and so this messenger William Marion
[5:45] brendham
[5:47] changed the focus
[5:49] from
[5:51] denominational worship and idolatry
[5:55] to the fullness of the Word of God for
[6:01] the hour
[6:02] now we know that prophets are always
[6:06] signposts
[6:08] reading from various parts of the Bible
[6:11] when it's Ezekiel random we know that
[6:14] prophets coming on the scene it's a sign
[6:17] to the age
[6:19] now I believe this present age is in
[6:23] danger of missing their samples
[6:27] and
[6:29] if we miss our signpost friends
[6:34] we will find ourselves in great danger
[6:39] for God does not send a man or men
[6:44] into judgment without first giving them
[6:48] a warning God always gives warning
[6:52] before judgment and he is giving Fortis
[6:57] warnings even now
[6:59] you are being warned even though that it
[7:04] is God Himself that is changing the
[7:07] times
[7:08] for certain prophecies have to be
[7:12] fulfilled
[7:13] there are certain things that must take
[7:16] place
[7:17] so that his word may be fulfilled in our
[7:21] day and in our times so he changed the
[7:26] times I mentioned at the end of my last
[7:32] street livestream that we are now
[7:36] standing at the times of the ending of
[7:39] the Gentile dispensation
[7:43] and it seems that in the mind's eye we
[7:47] can see the plan writing
[7:50] written on the wall the signs around us
[7:55] in earth and sky in ear in every aspect
[7:59] whether its government will its politics
[8:01] whether it's in the courts in the
[8:03] schools in the streets wherever the
[8:06] signs of the times are everywhere and
[8:10] there's a brand new feeling coming it's
[8:13] in the air can't you feel it friends
[8:15] there's a feeling that something is
[8:18] fixing to happen something is about to
[8:23] take place there's a
[8:26] assessment shift going on right while we
[8:30] are knows we are now here seeking and
[8:33] talking about these things now many
[8:37] years ago there was an earthquake in
[8:40] India and it's most reported that many
[8:45] before the actual earthquake
[8:49] animals were were moving away from walls
[8:53] going on the trees or going into the
[8:57] open field and
[8:59] dogs were howling and people wondered
[9:03] why what was going on but you see what
[9:07] they sense the oncoming danger
[9:12] before the human beings did and even God
[9:17] and His Word says the stark
[9:20] the animals they know the judgments and
[9:24] the coming of the Lord but my people
[9:27] knows not the judgments of the Lord and
[9:29] this we are seen happening in our day
[9:33] and in our times yes friends he changed
[9:36] the tanks and to everything there is a
[9:41] season and there is a time and when that
[9:44] season is up and a new time or age is
[9:50] about to begin then my friends we must
[9:55] be able to recognize it and be prepared
[9:59] to see those changes I
[10:04] believe we are now at the changing of
[10:07] another time
[10:08] as I've said it's a time for something
[10:12] to take place
[10:15] Jesus spoke in the words
[10:18] Matthew 24 when you see
[10:23] signs in the heavens
[10:25] signs in the earth
[10:28] Paris turns upon us
[10:31] with Wars rumors of wars
[10:35] earthquakes
[10:37] everywhere
[10:38] the sea is roaring
[10:41] my friends
[10:43] pestilences he spoke about coming upon
[10:47] the face of the earth when you see those
[10:50] viruses those epidemics those
[10:54] pestilences coming upon the face of the
[10:57] earth know that my coming is naughty so
[11:01] I announce to you the coming of the Lord
[11:04] is at hand are you prepared prepare to
[11:09] meet thy God if you have not left close
[11:13] as you possibly can draw nigh to him
[11:16] call upon his name ask for his
[11:20] forgiveness ask him to come into your
[11:23] life and if you claim and believe that
[11:27] he's in your life tell him Lord I want
[11:30] to walk closer and closer as I possibly
[11:35] can for your glory and for your honor
[11:38] yes sir Jesus spoke about this day he
[11:42] says when you see this these things it
[11:45] is the beginning of Sorrows
[11:47] the beginning of Sorrows saying in other
[11:51] words we are now living in a pre
[11:54] tribulation period we are living in this
[11:58] period my friends when the tribulation
[12:02] is starting to usher its way in
[12:06] gradually by increasing
[12:10] birth pains and problems and travail and
[12:14] trials coming in and while that is
[12:17] happening the rapture is fixing to take
[12:21] the bride out of here for God is not
[12:25] going to leave his people his children
[12:28] him here upon the earth when all of the
[12:32] major judgments and the major
[12:35] tribulation begins we will be taken out
[12:40] of here by what we believers know as the
[12:44] rapture of the Saints of the Living God
[12:47] oh I live for that day and for that hour
[12:51] but even if I am NOT alive or you were
[12:55] not alight for that hour he promised he
[12:58] will raise the dead first and then that
[13:01] remain and are alight he'll be caught up
[13:05] into the presence of the Lord absent
[13:08] from the body
[13:09] with the Lord oh what a great day what a
[13:14] great captain in time we will have what
[13:17] a great brush our time in the presence
[13:20] of the Living God
[13:21] when we shall meet and greet each other
[13:24] and the saints that have gone before in
[13:28] the house of the Lord however Jesus said
[13:32] at the beginning of Sorrows the
[13:35] beginning of sorrow our tribulation that
[13:38] is to come
[13:41] also known as the time of Jacob's
[13:45] trouble
[13:48] yes my friends we live in this time when
[13:53] it's time now for God's time clock is
[13:57] striking the hour you say what do you
[14:00] mean God's time clock God's timepiece
[14:04] Israel the nation of Israel it's God's
[14:08] timepiece if you want to know the time
[14:13] of the day you want to know the hour if
[14:16] you're asking me sir do you know what
[14:20] time it is I will answer you by saying
[14:23] look at the nation of Israel for
[14:27] something is fixing to happen with her
[14:30] and for her we my friends can look ahead
[14:34] and see that Israel is suddenly going to
[14:39] be voted into a position of power and
[14:42] influence great influence if you think
[14:46] that she has influence and power on the
[14:49] earth now watch my friends what's fixing
[14:53] to happen for Israel is now fixing to
[14:59] enter into her global power
[15:04] the presence of the anointing of God is
[15:08] leaving the Chettle church as the
[15:12] Gentile church rots and goes into her
[15:16] time of corruption and travail my
[15:19] friends the Spirit of the Living God
[15:22] it's writing the words across every door
[15:26] in Chabad written across every
[15:29] denomination
[15:30] the glory of the Lord
[15:33] is the pardon the glory of the Lord is
[15:38] slowly slipping away and that's the Sun
[15:42] rose in the east and sets in the west
[15:47] my friends and then when it sets in the
[15:51] west the next morning it goes back east
[15:56] even saw the Sun s um som rose in the
[16:02] eastern world
[16:04] Jesus Christ came in East and my friends
[16:10] now
[16:11] time for sunset is the sunset hour on
[16:16] upon the western world
[16:19] everything is going dark
[16:21] everywhere the church age going dark the
[16:26] spirit of Leticia upon the church world
[16:30] cry out against the church oh my god
[16:35] take them out that blow the trumpet in
[16:37] Zion tell them people my people their
[16:40] iniquity and the house of Israel of our
[16:43] sins yes my friends and so the light of
[16:47] God which has shined and is still
[16:52] shining in a glimmer upon the Gentile
[16:55] world
[16:56] especially here in the West that
[16:59] spirit of Almighty God the anointing the
[17:03] light of God the great perfect
[17:05] realization that comes by the revelation
[17:09] of the Holy Spirit it's going right back
[17:12] east again and it's going to rest upon
[17:16] the Jewish people and anoint them and
[17:19] use them for his glory and honor no
[17:23] matter what your thoughts are about
[17:27] that's the word of the Living God
[17:29] written in the spider that must come to
[17:32] pass for heavens and earth will pass
[17:34] away but my words shall never pass away
[17:38] market in Israel is coming into power
[17:43] further and far and by the fulfillment
[17:47] of prophecy amen yes sir oh praise God
[17:53] hallelujah I'm saying my friends it's
[17:57] not that I naturally know anything but
[18:01] in my soul my spirit I know my friends
[18:06] from the Word of God than the revelation
[18:10] of the Holy Spirit that Israel my
[18:13] friends is first going to experience a
[18:17] time of great trouble and trouble upon
[18:21] earth it is the time of Jacob's trouble
[18:26] then what will it be time of Jacob's
[18:30] trouble
[18:31] Israel will be deceiving others just
[18:35] like Jacob deceived others
[18:38] trick others Israel my friends would be
[18:44] in such a place where she will also be
[18:47] betrayed by a lot of other nations in
[18:51] whom she put her trust in whom she
[18:55] trusted their loyalty and their
[18:57] friendship she's going to face a time of
[19:00] betrayal also on trickery and deception
[19:04] he will use trickery and deception
[19:10] but she will also be betrayed and
[19:14] tricked that time is right at the door
[19:18] right upon us yes sir so we see in order
[19:24] for her to come to a place
[19:27] for Israel like Jacob
[19:31] to really be able to grab ahold and hold
[19:36] on to her rightful birth right
[19:39] inheritance she will use every trickery
[19:44] every deception and every betrayal in
[19:47] the book for that's Harbert right and
[19:51] she'll take a hold of it and she what
[19:54] let it go but while she's doing that she
[19:59] will also be tricked and be betrayed for
[20:02] we know this world adding into that we
[20:06] are now the pre tribulation period and
[20:08] they're going into the tribulation
[20:10] period so subtly that you you know you
[20:14] will hardly realize or recognize what's
[20:17] really taking place and one day you'll
[20:20] wake up and say oh I thought we were to
[20:24] be warned you are being warned by the
[20:26] signs of the times by the servants of
[20:29] the lid God wherever they are that we
[20:32] are in this season and time is slipping
[20:35] away and time will soon blend and change
[20:39] into eternity it will all be over then
[20:41] but before that certain things in the
[20:45] Word of God must take place friends
[20:48] Israel must as I say come to her place
[20:52] of power she must come to her time of
[20:55] the Feast of the Trebek's she must also
[21:00] regardless of whatever obstacles are in
[21:03] her way she must rebuild Solomon's
[21:08] Temple right where it is for when she
[21:11] does that there must be the sacrifices
[21:15] reinstated so the red heifer will
[21:19] suddenly appear on the scene oh praise
[21:23] be to Jehovah praise be to the Lord God
[21:26] Almighty may his name be praised and
[21:29] blessed forevermore glory to God that
[21:32] powers upon us I feel it in my spirit my
[21:36] soul write down my friends that the Word
[21:39] of God is now moving the supernatural
[21:43] the universe is moving things are
[21:47] shifting and taking place and God is
[21:50] about receive his glory yes sir here we
[21:55] are my friends I tell you but after his
[21:59] rally
[22:00] has been tested
[22:03] after the testing will come the blessing
[22:07] after jacobs testing then came the
[22:12] blessing so will it be with Jacobs
[22:16] children and his generations that have
[22:19] held to God's unchanging hand of the
[22:23] Word of God
[22:25] friends sometimes we don't understand
[22:29] that nation may stumble it may even do
[22:34] wrong things at times it may do things
[22:37] maybe contrary to what's even written in
[22:41] the word
[22:42] but regardless of that you must look
[22:45] beyond and see they are the children of
[22:47] the people of God God will judge where
[22:52] and who he has the judge and who yes the
[22:55] best he will bless who has to repent
[22:58] they'll have to repent as a nation but
[23:01] never mind all of that the holy God of
[23:05] heaven is in control for he changed the
[23:08] times he changed the seasons and when
[23:11] they moral and spiritual supernatural
[23:14] arc of the universe is moving
[23:18] none should get in its way and try to
[23:21] hinder it or stop it for as the
[23:24] scripture said you got Mills of God
[23:26] grain slow my friends but if you get in
[23:30] its way it'll grind you to powder
[23:32] whether you be a person whether you be a
[23:35] power of government no matter who and
[23:37] what we are the mills of God will grant
[23:40] you the powder make way for the king
[23:43] make way for the fulfillment of the word
[23:46] make way for the word of God to come to
[23:49] pass my friends for it will surely come
[23:52] to pass whether we are willing not it
[23:55] will come to pass for God has spoken and
[23:59] his word cannot change yes my friends we
[24:03] see clearly
[24:05] that God's fig tree has already begun to
[24:08] blossom in preparation for when he comes
[24:12] again he'll be able to go to that tree
[24:16] Israel being the grobotz fig tree and
[24:19] find sweet fruit for his coming glory
[24:22] that he might eat something that's a
[24:25] sweet in his in his mouth and the sweet
[24:28] mass trails of
[24:30] perfume in his nostrils as he receives
[24:34] the great sacrifices in his wonderful
[24:37] presence oh praise God the Messiah's
[24:41] glory about to be made manifest oh god
[24:46] the manifest God to his people
[24:48] declaring himself by the unveiling of
[24:51] his word in this hour but then they
[24:54] shall see him face to face oh my god
[24:58] they'll see him face to face we speak
[25:01] spiritually but they will literally see
[25:04] him for all every eyes shall behold him
[25:08] and they have recognized him as their
[25:11] Messiah Oh glory to God SARS
[25:15] Ebola and
[25:18] now Karuna
[25:20] my friends when near this these plagues
[25:25] begin to fall
[25:26] and when we see the plague
[25:31] Korona crowning our lands crowning the
[25:36] people evil coming to its crowning time
[25:39] my friends I believe it's at the same
[25:43] time of darkness as it was in Egypt I
[25:49] believe it's the same time when my
[25:52] friends the angel of God comes at that
[25:57] particular time you say well why is the
[26:00] angel of God the God going to come when
[26:03] is darkness and and you've preached a
[26:05] few weeks ago how the entire light and
[26:09] truth of the word of God is going to a
[26:12] spiritual supernatural black oh
[26:16] just as it was in Egypt
[26:19] when it was darkness then the angel of
[26:24] God was set forth for those who had the
[26:27] blood upon their doorposts and
[26:31] so it was then so is it now that the
[26:35] angel of God is now going forward in a
[26:40] sealing time there is a ceiling
[26:42] anointing when the great Holy Spirit the
[26:47] great angels are here to seal the true
[26:51] believers in their foreign seal them in
[26:56] their foreign Florida God yes sir he's
[27:00] sealing his own he's sealing their minds
[27:03] he's protecting their minds against the
[27:08] arrows of the devil the suggestions the
[27:11] evil thoughts
[27:13] from the devil the temptations the
[27:16] seductions the charm the witchery that
[27:19] the devil is sending forth took to me
[27:22] guile the people of God these enticing
[27:25] and seducing spirits that have invaded
[27:27] our planet invaded the Church of the
[27:30] Living God in this hour until the mouths
[27:34] of many men of God have been corrupt and
[27:37] they then they can't even give a warning
[27:40] anymore they hardly use the word hell
[27:43] they'll hardly speak about sin
[27:46] repentance back to the word they'll
[27:49] hardly tell you repent your people get
[27:52] on your knees talk to God crane with
[27:55] sincerity not some dry eye
[27:59] mascara painted wipe of your face but a
[28:02] genuine repentance of comes from the
[28:05] Living God when your heart reaches up to
[28:08] and he reaches out to you and you
[28:10] realize from that hour you are a changed
[28:13] person changed not by the words of a man
[28:16] by your change by the hand about money

[28:36] sealing his own in this outlaw sealing
[28:40] our brains and our hearts against the
[28:43] works of the devil yes sir right now
[28:47] that greatest battle ever fought is
[28:51] going on my friends the longest running
[28:55] war which started in heaven but Michael
[28:58] and the Angels it's still running here
[29:01] today the battle between God's
[29:04] revelation wisdom versus my the wisdom
[29:08] of Satan versus the Revelation faith
[29:11] wisdom of God given to his anointed
[29:14] servants in this day and in this hour
[29:17] and a battle is now raging my friends
[29:21] and see here it is my friends that this
[29:24] great Word of God is being fulfilled so

[32:42] him that lives in us praise God
[32:46] hallelujah amen yes sir here we are then
[32:50] as believers
[32:52] walking through this world
[32:54] filled with filth and sin filled with
[32:58] all manner of evil but the Bible says
[33:02] will come out walking like Daniel
[33:05] without any smoke upon our clothing will
[33:08] come out of this sinful period with a
[33:12] robe of a bribe of spotless weight not a
[33:17] not one speck was since Cain will be
[33:21] dare there any more for reason they're
[33:23] washed by the blood of the Lamb even now
[33:26] we are under the protection of the blood
[33:30] of the Lamb upon our hearts glory to God
[33:34] this great Holy Spirit blood of God the
[33:39] sealing spirit and sealing time of the
[33:42] Living God doesn't hear upon us o
[33:45] friends God he not things that are hears
[33:50] he knows those that are here and he is
[33:53] able to call out to anoint and to seal
[33:57] those that are his for his glory praise
[34:00] God hallelujah all my friends my father
[34:05] was a builder of ships and
[34:08] when those ships were sealed I friends I
[34:13] tell you then and there launched that
[34:17] the water could be all around that ship
[34:20] but the water will not be able to get in
[34:23] the ship because that ship is sealed
[34:26] praise God from the outside to the
[34:30] inside or from the inside to the outside
[34:34] the ship is sealed and then my friends a
[34:37] true believer it can be said of them
[34:40] they're in this they're floating through
[34:43] this sea of sin and they're in the sea
[34:47] of sin but the ship sin is not in the
[34:49] ship Thanks being a God we are floating
[34:52] down the stream of time we have not long
[34:56] to stay Oh friends we're out of here by
[34:59] the power of the Holy Spirit or the same
[35:02] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[35:05] dwell in you he shall also quicken your
[35:08] mortal bodies by the Spirit of the
[35:11] Living God that dwells in you here we
[35:14] are under the protection of the blood
[35:17] the same posts everywhere are pointing
[35:20] to a coming of the Lord and evil has
[35:23] seconds and the mocking of our God and
[35:26] of his people is now taking place but
[35:30] there's a changing time as I've said
[35:33] that change will be Israel coming into
[35:37] her power in this hour amen watch it now
[35:41] it's about to happen and you must be
[35:44] ready for it amen and it's coming
[35:47] whether whether you are ready or not
[35:49] it's coming and it's going to happen
[35:52] there's another changing time that's
[35:55] here upon us a
[35:57] new world order it's now beginning to
[36:01] emerge
[36:02] [Music]
[36:04] amidst disappearance of covet 19
[36:09] revelation 19
[36:12] this
[36:14] environment of pandemic is a saying for
[36:19] spiritual people of the Living God
[36:22] to recognize what is taking place
[36:26] for it is the changing of the world
[36:29] system
[36:31] the entire changing of this systems of
[36:35] the world is now taking place
[36:40] morally
[36:42] spiritually the entire cosmic
[36:47] environment of the entire world is now
[36:51] undergoing renovation
[36:54] restoration use any word who want
[36:57] transformation simply it's going through
[37:01] change and when God begins to change the
[37:06] time the season and age he says I am God
[37:12] who can withstand who can't stop words
[37:16] ten his power who can withstand the
[37:19] changes that he is making and he makes
[37:22] glory to his marvelous and wonderful
[37:24] names so this great moral and spiritual
[37:29] supernatural are of the universe
[37:32] kids who feel it friends get to
[37:35] recognize it it has moved the
[37:38] pillar of fire
[37:40] that led the Church of Israel has picked
[37:45] up itself and it's starting to move
[37:49] as I said the force moving from the
[37:51] agendas going back to Jewish brothers
[37:54] and sisters that trust in the great
[37:56] Jehovah God amen yes sir learn his
[38:01] marvelous name but even wider than
[38:04] Israel itself
[38:06] this presence of Almighty God is it's
[38:11] just seeping out and permeating every
[38:15] aspect of the entire universe Oh
[38:20] friends it's everywhere if you have any
[38:25] super spiritual sense you'll recognize
[38:29] that the universe is moving we live in a
[38:34] changing world
[38:36] and there is a new world order
[38:40] being born and emerging and you know for
[38:45] the new world order to come into being
[38:51] or to fully appear on the scene
[38:55] the old order must go
[38:59] it has to rot and die in the put away so
[39:05] that the New World Order can come to
[39:08] life and be made manifest right before
[39:12] us so therefore we are in the midst
[39:16] social change is going on
[39:20] political change is going on
[39:25] there's a generational change that's
[39:30] going on
[39:31] yes this new generation
[39:35] their way of thinking
[39:38] their mindset is totally different
[39:43] from the last generation or let me say
[39:48] my generation even my generation they
[39:53] won't taste us and their mindset is
[39:57] totally different this is going straight
[40:00] my friends the one world
[40:03] citizens of one world
[40:07] citizens
[40:09] American German Spanish French
[40:14] African
[40:16] whatever nation you're from it's moving
[40:20] away from that and it's growing my
[40:23] friends not to any specific race or any
[40:27] specific nation but it's moving on us
[40:30] all back to the original where we were
[40:33] at the beginning of the world with Adam
[40:36] and Eve when it was one race just one
[40:40] race and the name of that great race is
[40:44] the human race and thank God I'm a part
[40:48] of it I trust you are too regardless of
[40:52] who we are we are all moving into that
[40:55] great time yes sir one man sang some
[41:00] wonderful words one loved one world one
[41:05] word and it's also of course I am
[41:08] absolutely against one world church one
[41:12] world orna of man I'm talking about the
[41:16] order of man
[41:18] trying to control the world whatever you
[41:21] want to see about it but I'm telling you
[41:23] that I am making a clear and plain I am
[41:26] against that but I look at the word and
[41:29] the Word of God said whoever or whatever
[41:32] is to be done will be done and there
[41:35] will be this one world order one world
[41:39] government and one world church it's
[41:43] coming on the scene Oh friends it's even
[41:47] now beginning to display and the
[41:50] incrementalist show its powers to change
[41:53] the entire world scene to change the
[41:56] that the politics to change all the
[42:00] thinking and thoughts of the people in
[42:02] the world it's doing that right now so
[42:06] just to repeat
[42:08] we are undergoing moral and spiritual
[42:12] change we are undergoing social change
[42:16] we're undergoing a generational change
[42:19] just as much as when
[42:22] Joshua and Caleb they came to the Jordan
[42:26] then there was a new generation led by
[42:29] Joshua and Caleb that entered over into
[42:33] the promised land and all of that older
[42:36] generation the Bible said then died out
[42:39] and their bones bleached in the
[42:41] wilderness sad as it sounds that is what
[42:43] had to happen for the new age this new
[42:46] world order to emerge and to come upon
[42:51] the stream some folks are fighting and
[42:54] resisting change but it's not time for
[42:57] that you God the true believer doesn't
[43:01] need to fight and resist change but we
[43:04] can live in that change because like
[43:07] Daniel who did not fightin and rebel
[43:12] against Nebuchadnezzar but he lived
[43:14] proved he could live godly in the midst
[43:18] of Babylon whoa friends you are called
[43:21] out to be the ladies of the Living God
[43:26] that can come up from the buck the pond
[43:29] right through all the muck and mire and
[43:32] raise yourself to the rising of the Sun
[43:36] and Jesus said of them Oh
[43:39] Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed
[43:42] like one of these because Solomon was a
[43:45] fading glory his Solomon's glory was
[43:48] temporal it was just human but that one
[43:51] was god-given glory given to that Lily
[43:55] all you great wonderful lilies of God
[43:58] you children of the Most High wherever
[44:01] you are hear the word of the Lord have a
[44:03] voice or the Holy Spirit come out from
[44:07] amongst them be not partakers of their
[44:09] plates and alter God's unchanging hand
[44:12] listen to the Shepherd's voice my sheep
[44:16] hear my voice and the stranger they will
[44:19] not follow but they will follow and come
[44:21] to their Shepherds boys my friends the
[44:25] many do not realize
[44:27] the bigger picture that a new world
[44:31] order see a new world system is now
[44:35] being born one is being dismantled while
[44:39] the new has been now constructed right
[44:44] before her very eyes it's happening and
[44:47] if you're not watching it'll go right by
[44:50] you and you will not recognize it the
[44:54] old order has to die and pass away so
[44:58] you must be aware
[45:01] acknowledge
[45:04] these changes
[45:06] are here upon us right now praise the
[45:11] name of the Lord isn't our God good my
[45:15] friends the Scriptures tell us and I'm
[45:18] beginning to wake this up now
[45:21] that perilous times will be upon us when
[45:25] men are going to be lovers of their own
[45:28] selves
[45:30] trucebreakers
[45:32] traitors heady highminded lovers
[45:35] of pleasure more than lovers of God
[45:39] selfish the Bible tells us from such
[45:42] turn away all my friends turn turn turn
[45:46] why will you die come out from amongst
[45:50] them be not partakers of their plagues

[45:59] experiments be the partakers my friends
[46:02] and their foolishness come to the wisdom
