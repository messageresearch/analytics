========================================
right um you'll be able to see a quotation from brother brandham in it and uh wonderful scriptures and blessings to you on this marvelous day and trust that every father in here will feel blessed of the Living God [Applause] Amen uh just a few things uh we're changing one of our procedures and and that is that uh when we are leaving the sanctuary we want to leave the sanctuary reverently quietly uh uh and uh with a sense of sincerity after the service right like brother BR said we shouldn't leave joking while we leaving chewing gum and whatever else while we're leaving not that I know that that was on here but I'm just saying we should leave with reverence like you tip toing out in the presence of angels amen amen and I will no longer be standing at the back door because what has been happening at the back door of the sanctuary here rather I will go in in the for you where I will greet you in there amen are you getting that now okay I'll go in the for you and the reason for that is we don't want to back up where you're talking to me and I'm talking to you you and the rest of people are waiting and meanwhile we have other people who have been blessed by the message blessed by the worship and they want to spend it doesn't matter whether it's 2 minutes 5 minutes or 10 minutes meditating before they get up to leave the presence of the Lord so we want to honor the Lord we want to honor that praise the Lord and we want to keep the sanctuary as a place where God comes and meets with us am brother Brandon said do you know if you like allocate a certain place whether it's your prayer closet or a tree or wherever and you and you start meeting the Lord there let's say uh 6:00 5:00 in the morning he says you know what he'll be there before you waiting on you so if we honor this place as a place where we come to meet with God it's not the building but it's him we honor it we act appropriately enough we invite his presence and then he'll come and draw near to us and we'll experience more of the presence of God and we'll honor him in that way [Applause] and that starts from this Sunday okay that starts from this Sunday so if the deacons know that you're hanging back and you're still in the sanctuary talking or whatever they will gently but firmly walk you out lead you out or ask you to go out right and don't take it as an offense because there's no partiality in God God deals with all of us in the same way praise the Lord may the Lord richly bless you and I'm happy to look and see all your beautiful wonderful handsome faces praise the Lord you know what you may chuckle at that but some of us are getting older but then we get a little silver on the here some people look down and that but it makes some people look even better you know praise the Lord so we praise God thank the Lord for that and give him glory amen uh God richly bless you all um today I'm going to speak on honoring thy father Exodus 20 verse 12 we welcome our visitors too we see a brother here we've never seen before may the Lord bless him praise the Lord in a wonderful way may the Lord bless each one of you that are here today Exodus 22 we're just going to read a short brief portion we're not going to labor on this subject we just speak briefly cuz we know that you have to get home and enjoy the Father's Day I can either have you enjoyed here in church or you can enjoy half here and half at home uh praise the Lord uh God bless you though amen let's read God's word before we read it let us pray praise God father we thank you for the worship the worship of the sons of Judah the singers the worshippers going before and uh the word following after so we invite your divine presence that your great holy spirit will surround us everyone and may they know and understand and is not just your son or servant standing at the pulpit but there's one greater than I Lord Jesus may the great Holy Spirit descend on us today oh God speak to us by the word Lift us up break the leonian spirit break away every Spirit contrary to Thy word and take thy Glory we ask in the name of Jesus Jus we bind and defeat and Cast Away every doubt and fear that may still be hanging around or resting upon your people take away every negative feeling every unforgiving Spirit oh God every backbiting lying devil that may seek to stare around every deceiver in the name of Jesus we take authority over you in Jesus name for the glory God right now thank you Father in the name of Jesus as we deliver your word and demonstrate the promise may you take the glory and the honor in Jesus name amen God bless you please be seated Hallelujah honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee God bless you please be seated Hallelujah now as we celebrate uh Father's Day uh today we specifically of course want to talk about fathers uh mothers have already had their day and uh you know that's all right uh I went into Sears the other day and when I walked in I said uh where's the where the men's stuff and it's all in the corner I couldn't hardly find B stuff I said what I said you mean that you redesign the place but this entire floor is the women's stuff and you've got us men way in the back and you said well that's the way they did it I said oh see seems like that's the way the whole world is going is that right praise the Lord at least I got some brothers agreeing with me here amen I got my back up praise the Lord hallelujah but that's the way the world is going but that's not the way God is going you know the prophets have spoken Isaiah the seven women will take hold of one man you know the Bible tells us in Revelation one power is coming into power women will come in the power it prophecies women will control even from the White House and that is to tell you that the carnal Natural Woman power will increase amen right but at the same time while he's saying about women increasing in power and stuff like that it's telling you also in the reverse that men will be Dishonored don't get quiet now I'm telling you the truth man will start to be Dishonored discarded cast aside thought about as a spar he me I know the husband's get say I know like you brothers can't say but this is what I'm here for let Arrows fly at me praise the Lord because I have the same what is in trueu right you agree with me isise the Lord yes oh this is the it's not atmosphere like let me say in your home this is the atmosphere that's in the world and that those Spirits are coming down and they're taking control of who soever will surrender themselves to them amen while the world is going one way God's people are going the opposite way the devil is dishonoring first of all let me pause here when I'm talking about honoring your father first I'm talking about honoring God Amen secondly when I talk about honoring your father I'm talking about honoring your pastor regardless of what was me I'm telling you it's going on the city you honor your pastor right and thirdly you honor your natural father amen your pastor is your spiritual father we know that then God is the father of us all honor your natural father so what I'm speaking about honoring your father is three-dimensional and that's how you have to listen so that you can fully understand here so we're talking about the world going one way right and uh God's people going to opposite way Satan is teaching the people that dishonor the word this honor the revelation of this hour this honor the pastor to the AG the prophet of this hour amen be little and uh and uh try to destroy the reputation credibility and confidence of the people in the servant of God that's plac in the position to be the voice of God to you locally the angel of the church amen and thirdly the devil is there to destroy the family the devil hates homogeneous United families that has a man as the headship you know the devil tries to try to replace that and put the woman as the headship well we know the neck turns the head but the neck is not the head is that right praise the Lord hallelujah see that the head is placed there specifically because that's where it is the headship spiritually Jesus Christ amen the headship in the church is not the church board it's the pastor that has the full Authority and in the hall amen the church Bo can advise the pastor this that that whatever what this is the final authority to say whether this or whether that praise the Lord now it's the same thing in the home the wife has the freedom to live is the power Amen to freely express any view amen praise the Lord but still takes the man to be the authority and the leadership in that home it doesn't matter whether the wife is educated wealthy beautiful a celebrity right with status and all like that if she wants to really know her position she'll right I can tell you for a fact this might sound funny but my mother had a relative great aunt of mine that was minister of Education brilliant studying foreign lands with all kinds of degrees to glass of the wall but she was so focused on studying that uh she she got into her 40s and and and then all of a sudden like she woke up out of this sleep uh being a student yes he's just going on studying studying getting all these accolades everything running to the United Nations there and there there and that's realize wait a minute I'm doing all of this stuff and I'm not married yet I don't even have a child yet you know I have all this money I got Prestige but I don't have a husband and I don't have a child you know and I mean she just didn't grab anybody but it just happened a humble simple fellow had the courage enough to be talking with her and before you know it they were married she didn't think and say oh this guy don't have nothing or this guy is not that educated he's just an ordinary guy and you know what after that whatever he did even though she was Minister she would come right down and be right there with him she didn't care what anybody says that was her husband amen praise the Lord that should be the attitude and the spirit that we have to Humble ourselves and be what we are supposed to be in this age and resist the spirit of the dev and the culture of the day the culture of the day some speaking to I don't want to call the person the person I was just about to tell you something there but let me say that but this woman said well when I was in the foreign country man was the leader and the boss I come to North America here and I find out the woman is the boss you see so let's not go with the way of the world but go with the way of the word of God and the word of God says that it wasn't Adam that sin Eve sin and because of that God says she shall not teach nor you serve Authority amen you serve leadership right can you serve leadership which is not your own you say why you beating on this go go on with your preaching and move on to another subject amen praise the lord it's all right when the preacher is preaching and talking about love in the atmosphere and it's nice to be sweet with one another that's good but you know sometimes you you need some medicine is that right um You need prives praise the Lord you need anti toxicant right you need stuff like that that will clean you up and clean you out and make you whole in the presence of God and it's this tasteful to any of us we don't we we don't really want to take it but uh you know that you need it and if you don't know you need it you're going to die just where you are amen Rock From Within praise the Lord I I I honestly believe that we H Christians and and take me nicely how I use the word up to cut the crap we need deification is that right let me put it this way when you have a computer so that your mind don't go in another atmosphere when you have a computer that's full with junk uh brother Glenn you know what you do you you stop one day and you're got to decrapify your computer is that right as with the computer so with the human being amen praise the Lord whether it's with your body or your soul we need deification praise and so sometimes God has to make the word come for in such a way that you begin to realize some of the nonsense you're believing in your head am some of the nonsense of your actions some of the nonsense in your attitude and come back to yourself because you know that we start losing focus we start losing the direction and we start going off and God has to pull us back bring us back into position by his grace so we must honor our father praise the Lord that thy days may be long upon the Lord land which the Lord thy God give it thee that you might this is the only commandment with a promise amen that is the father your father my father I going to honor my father me you don't know my father you know what my father did you know what my father does you know how my father acts do you know this about my father that it don't doesn't really matter you are a product of him and that is what God is talking about let me say this regardless of anything honor thy father don't you go and think it's a it's a wonderful thing to expose your father's weakness all his mistakes in other words I'm quoting here scripture from the scripture in the Book of Genesis I'm using that image to bring that truth out how Noah's son went and uncover his father's nakedness while Noah was sleeping just poess Ro well the thing about it my friend is that the the other one came and covered him one covered him praise the Lord so you have to understand that love covers a multitude of sins uh love doesn't Joy have any Joy or satisfaction in blaming in accusing or as we in West Indian uh par would say catching people I yeah we not here to expose people we are not here in any way to expose you with this we are here to rebuke sin rebuke wrong wherever it is found regardless of who is in and let the Holy Spirit deal with that heart so that we all can be right with God Amen is that right that's what we're here for so honor your father regardless of uh what whatever you might be doing maybe did in the past did to your mother did to you whatever honor your father don't you go exposing all kinds of things and think it's a joy to to reveal or show uh his weaknesses whatever honor your father by Keeping the Faith of your father amen God bless you if you had a father that even had a little bit of fa praise the Lord you say oh my God what are you saying brother Simon let me tell you you know you don't understand how God works God will take your father and make take make you uh let him take you every single day to the Catholic Church to worship god there now as you go older and you understand the Bible more and more things are revealed to you you may disagree now with the faith that that your father was taking you in to go for the baptism circumcision whatever uh like that but you know what God used that first of all to give you faith and then he opens up your understanding more and more you're not stuck there but your understanding and your Revelation unfolds it's not that it's not like a a rejection but it's just that your understanding has expanded and you can't stay in that childhood Faith you've got to move on to a mature faith in Christ where your Revelation has got a hold of you and you become the image of Christ understand me praise the Lord so let's honor our Father by Keeping the Faith of Our Fathers praise the Lord keep the faith in Jesus Christ glory to God hallelujah you honor your father also by giving gifts to your father is that right so your your father maybe lived a wrong life he's down and out maybe he's not living like he should maybe he's wealthy that doesn't matter the fathers always like after they spent their whole life giving out they might not even need it but they still feel good when the children come back and give back back something to them is it right it's the attitude and the spirit of them acknowledging their gratitude and their attitude is what is important is this making any sense amen praise the Lord hallelujah I don't want to me talking to myself but uh I want to be able to talk to you and let you see the very importance of fathers and that importance cannot be overstated amen we must understand that uh we see reports confirming the importance of fathers in a family some people say well I I don't have to have a a father or a man or a husband in my life I can make along all right no doubt God will help you maybe you can but it does not break God's first uh first principle of the Bible when he made Adam and Eve husband and wife and place the the sacredness of marriage at the very top of his agenda is that righten in other words having a a Godly marriage a peaceful relationship uh mother father children in a in a spiritual even in a natural Eden the home is a place of Peace Andis of love then we find out that is God's idea but from the ideal comes other situations right that God knows about but at the same time he wants all of us to work towards the ideal that's the ideal praise the Lord yes you can yes a woman can yes even a man can raise a family by himself but that's not God's ideal God's ideal amen is to have a wonderful home with a peaceful uh emic situations as back in the Garden of Eden praise the Lord that's what I believe in and that's what the Bible teaches and that's what we should all Inspire to and that is what I'm trying to teach you uh teach you that if you were not in that kind of a background if you were not in that kind of a atmosphere in that kind of a cultural experience where you honor your your father and this modern day thing where young people just stop their father in the back and call him Tim and Tom or Jim or John I really seen some kick their father I seen them take the the attitude of the mother that might be bitter against the father and start talking all kinds of stuff against the father and talking any way to the father even when the father is sinful and wrong the man is the image of Christ and the woman is the image of the church so when you're talking to the man personally he might he he no doubt can be 100% guilty but God is still looking at the image that you're having to deal with praise the Lord honor thy father praise the Lord now glory to his name so the important of the father cannot be overstated because the father in the home whether you like it or not is a stabilizing factor and like me the pastor in the church spiritual father sometimes he has to say things to the wife to the children that areful don't want to hear it don't like it but it's about to say because that's his position to be the rock to be the anchor to be the BW the defense The Protector the provider the one that's going to have a vision and look ahead for the family planning ahead and working together to accomplish a goal for the purpose of the glory of God Amen praise the Lord honor like Father praise God forever more Hallelujah listen friends let me tell you children need need fathers present in their lives is that right look the say look over Canada we are ending up with a whole lot of single uh uh mother families and single father families to right either the wife leaves or the mother leaves you know is this As the World Turns experiences what they call marriage today right today they're married and two weeks later a month later or a year later I'm tired of it they grab their first I'm leaving and they just walk up and they think it's a simple thing they don't real likee how seriously serious that is and how God has placed that as part of his great system of Faith amen and even if you want to go socially uh along the line of social dynamics and think about the country nations are built on families and Any Nation knows that when the family uh foundations begin to crumble and fall apart the nation starts falling apart it happened with Rome from inside it wasn't armies from outside conquered Rome it was the social conditions of family put they broke down into RS and parties and anything gos and whatever and the social structure broke down and they defeated themselves actually from within we see Society not going that way but we are going the opposite way we are going to other God's word we are going hon the preachers that are preaching God's word I'm talking about whether Pastor PRI this superintendent preser whatever name you want to put on it actually it's the same thing right you you can fancy the name but it's the same thing it's just the approach to it but let me tell you brothers and sisters you honor God honor your pastor honor your father and wies honor your husband the Bible say so praise the name of the Lord listen friends very important it's St the LI his children amen because the father is there to instruct discipline Hallelujah some of you can remember that it's all right if you stop that and you continue doing it I said stop it you continue doing it but she said you w't stop that you wait till your father comes home there's something about the father that not plac there that when you tell that child wait till your father comes home the Dynamics change is that right you don't want to deal with your father you feel that you can talk to your mother and talk around your mother but when you come to your father no amen praise the Lord hallelujah so it's very important that you have some uh Father Figure there amen praise the Lord hallelujah because sometimes you know God places people in your life that may not be your natural father it may be somebody like a big brother you know you have that organization and that figure takes that part could be an adopted father glory to God hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord um wow um the first text I got this morning is from a government official over there in GH why he took me like he take me as his father and that's how he addresses me daddy this and father that and what do you think about this whatever like that father thy father it's important that you do that so that God's promises and blessings can come upon and when you dishonor that it his his plan doesn't work the way it should yes so fathers need to discipline but not only discipline because that's all some fathers know it's the discipline every two minut discipline but they there also to encourage amen fathers need to encourage their children not put them down you know I've heard some sister child make a mistake you dummy are you useless you st or this or that are your back word or sometimes I heard even mothers say you am to no good you know you're putting these kind of curses on your children you putting those kinds of talk on them you don't realize that the words of your mouth has power amen and that we as parents in our position uh you know in the Bible when those prophets were there the Patriarchs when their sons and their daughters and they were dying said well you're going to be blessed and you going to this but you going to be a servant and you going to be the and whatever they said that's what happened so we as parents have to be careful of what we say so let's encourage them and lift them up praise the Lord they may do something bad they may not obey the word even your word but we have to say come on you know you're better than that but you could said it the other way you look look what you did run them down but don't waste your time running them down lift them up straighten the part in them that is Val good strengthen their character and encourage them that the grace of God may come upon their lives and we have the promise in the Bible that if we bend the tree while it is Young when it becomes older it will not depart from the faith why because then oh I see what mom was telling oh that's what that meant oh now they begin to understand before you know they start doing the very same things they thought they wouldn't do because they realize it wasn't bad for them it was good for them it wasn't meant to break them it was meant to bless them right this is the end of my life I can't go on like this I can't live the way no it's it's not the end it's just a little Bend in the road road that you have to pass through before you start a really wonderful life honor thy father amen praise the Lord hallelujah very important so we have to encourage one our children in this great and important work and and of course I'm doing my work by fortifying and strengthening the hearts of fathers not to give up amen because in the present environment of this AG age and with the spirit that's in the world to give women more of a domineering and dominating spirit amen rather than having a real lady like feminine Spirit right back in the back in England the term is used Gentile or gentle woman well you have women today but they're not gentlemen M I'm not saying all but now they're traing along with work boots just like a man with their wrenches in their hand and they they'll Hammer you to with the hammer that they're working with and you know praise the Lord um this has gone from just Lip lip using their lips to using everything at hand but B whatever whatever is there if you get burn you get burn if you get hit you get hit whatever else and that spirit is manifest I'm just telling you like it is we not here to make up stuff or make it sounds really nice I can preach about butterflies and about geology and and all those kinds of subjects too but that's not what this is about here this is life this is life we are now in preparation to go and live eternally and you got to we just rehearsing down here you rehears it we got to try and get it right amen praise the Lord cuz we'll be together forever and ever and ever with one another amen praise the Lord hallelujah it's so wonderful I'm glad I have a wonderful wife and um we we're going to soon be hitting 50 years together and I'm not tired of her and hopefully she's not tired of [Applause] praise the Lord hallelujah praise God I'm not going to tell you a lie like some people do in the weddings we never had a we never had any differences nothing from the cheek or from the top is that right there oh yes well real people know that a't true that you're going to live a whole lifetime and you didn't have any different I didn't marry my wife to together a yes woman anything I say yes anything I say yes yes or she didn't marry a Yes Man either and anything she wants that's a yes there and he said you marry a mouse or a man rather than a man a man has to have a back a backbone and a spine doesn't mean and he ought to be mat but he doesn't need to be controlling he needs to be T but he needs to be tender is that right right he needs to know when to comfort and when to be corrected and and and even when you're doing those things being corrective uh you still got to be correcting in love amen oh praise God hallelujah I hope I'm not getting myself on in any problems here with anybody praise the Lord hallelujah praise God you young men as you get older your able to know how to cach your words and how to act differently so that you can have a peaceful life amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so we also as a church need to fortify men in our community to strengthen them so that they don't just give up the give up and and let you know just let the let the wife run the house take over the home and everything else and they don't worry about nothing no you need to be involved M you didn't be involved with your wife with the kids and just don't leave her with her taking care of all your school stuff L not look I'm not a preach World servant on that but you need to be involved this is together I said it's together it's not just one person doing this of course you going to allocate things that I'll do this you do that I'll do this you do that but you come together and you talk about it it's together always together it's an invisible Union that last for eternity praise God who you believe this praise God say an amen amen praise God glad you're not falling asleep on me here today praise the Lord wanting to know this true so this tremendous role of fatherhood there's Great Value to it in the word of God Amen so children you who are here that have a father you're so blessed you're so blessed to have a father that really cares about you that really thinks about you prays for you and you're really doubly blessed if you have a Godly father that will point you and lead you in the right direction it's so important that you remember God blessed you with a Godly father and the father of course should be the spiritual leader of the house and in charge of making know God to his children Hallelujah we have to make God known to our children God's ways God's blessings praise the Lord and he is to be a leader but not a dictator are you listening to me one Brothers take my advice don't try to be a dictator but it must be known that you are the leader praise the Lord and of course you have different forms of leadership you have gracious leadership you know um where where it's just a put in the t- shop and and then you you have all kinds of quiet confident leadership doesn't have to keep noise just does what it has to do and and and the family goes on life goes on praise the Lord hallelujah praise God you know not those kinds of men that walk in the house and says where's my my suffer or it's not ready yet the tables the dishes and everything else well no that's not real leadership right praise God all all that this is a spirit of fear and and and whatever else you're trying to do but uh look at the Lord Jesus amen and the way he behaved amen praise God when you had to call something a fox he call it a fox when you want to call it sin he called it sin but yet he moved with Grace with character with love praise God and with compassion praise the Lord hallelujah I know you're kind of getting a little bit Restless now I can sense it but I just have a few more things to say Father's Day there's a lot for you to do when you go out of here but you need the spiritual Foundation amen praise the Lord hallelujah and so when the children are still young we as fathers ought to make Godly decisions on behalf of our children and we need to know with with with real spiritual timing there not many special age say well at 60 or at 80 or this children mature at different you know and you have to know your own child be a sense that but you need to make Godly decisions that will help and affect the future of your children now but when those children start to get to a certain age and you can start seeing them becoming uncomfortable and responsible you need to know when to start taking your hands off when to draw back like the story of the eagle put the young ones down there and let them start fending for themselves and going down in the valley and this and that but he says she was sitting on a rock and the dad sitting on a rock they just look him down he said let a wol for something thing trying to come and attack them and they'll scoop down on the wings of eagles to tear that thing those beasts apart amen so that's the same thing as parents we have to sense the season the time when they start taking your hands off all right uh when they young you make all the Godly decisions but when they get much much older you don't try to run their lives you try to advise and guide but not deand and not command and I love God to help them because you must have confidence in the in the character that you inculcated or built into them if you're still walking in fear it means you don't even believe what you T them is that right you've got to believe and have confidence that God's word will come come to pass hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah remember nobody is perfect right including your father you know when I was much Young when I and all of us know that when you were a child your father was like he was the strongest man in the world he had the biggest muscles your father was the tallest your father was the best everything about it but you notice as you get older you start to see chicks here and there in his arm is that right you realize that uh yes he he he's my father but he's still a little this a little that but you still need to honor your father praise the Lord I see my little short father of course he was short like me looking up to my eldest brother and say why and today World they scream at that father they'll pick him up by you know his shirt or something and tell him off but my brother just stood there you know quietly and he listened and he heard everything and he you know he could he could do whatever he wanted but the way he was brought up he wouldn't do that he wouldn't dream of doing that and so when the word is placed in the children and the faith of God is in them they will not depart from that doesn't matter how many years or how old we get later on so we got a job to the brother and sisters never mind whether you see CHS in your mother your father this one or that one you just honor your mother and your father that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God give thee you believe that say Amen if you believe that say Amen if you believe it one more time say amen amen praise God I [Applause] believe amen hallelujah praise the Lord and I want to honor those fathers that may stand in the position for a missing father praise the Lord hallelujah a non biological father we need to honor the father we need to honor step fathers Hallelujah and we need to honor grandfathers praise the Lord I am for so I have a double blessing today praise the lord we need father father step fathers fathers fathers and give glory to God God for them praise the Lord because God has a reason why they came into our lives amen hallelujah and if you're here today and you're a child with no father pres present in your life then let me encourage you not to be discouraged but to take heart your wonderful um men in this church there myself in this church uh and and if you want to use me uh for the image of a father then use that image and I'm sure God will help me to be a blessing and a help to you in forms of advice or counseling or anything of that nature is that clear praise the name of the Lord that's very important that we bear that remember that God loves every one of us amen and now don't forget your promise hold to the promise of God and you will see it in your life
