[1:00:40] When God Says something
[1:00:42] he he's powerful to fulfill it amen
[1:00:47] he is faithful to fulfill it amen
[1:00:51] when God said it he mean it and he can
[1:00:55] do it
[1:00:56] oh yeah
[1:00:57] I would doubt won't stop him
[1:01:00] just any system in this world will stop
[1:01:04] him when he says something he mean it
[1:01:06] and he will do it amen
[1:01:10] and I said and Isaiah 55 verse 11. the
[1:01:15] Lord said that when the when his word
[1:01:18] come out of his mouth
[1:01:20] he will not come back avoid
[1:01:23] but it will amen accomplish the purpose
[1:01:29] or he was sanded for amen so Heaven and
[1:01:34] Earth will pass but the word of God Will
[1:01:37] Remain the true amen oh I love this
[1:01:44] I talk about Peter Peter where he saw
[1:01:49] Jesus working on the water and then he
[1:01:52] said Master if it's that you
[1:01:55] make me come and walk on the water with
[1:01:57] you
[1:01:58] and Jesus said come
[1:02:01] and then he get out of the board and he
[1:02:04] started walking on the water
[1:02:07] but then he sees the Tumblers and he
[1:02:10] started doubting about it and then he is
[1:02:13] starting to go down
[1:02:15] but the important thing here is what
[1:02:19] Jesus said he said come and when he say
[1:02:22] come even if you down even if you if you
[1:02:27] falling apart he will help you to get up
[1:02:31] to get to the point because he's saying
[1:02:34] come
[1:02:35] he say that he mean it
[1:02:39] when he was on the ball with the
[1:02:41] disciple
[1:02:42] he taught the disciple let's go to the
[1:02:45] other way
[1:02:46] suddenly he starts sleeping he was tired
[1:02:49] from the ministry and then the devil
[1:02:52] make a storm
[1:02:54] the disciplegate is here
[1:02:57] destroy screaming and they started
[1:03:00] saying Lord don't you see that we dying
[1:03:03] that we're trying
[1:03:07] and then Jesus wake up and say what is
[1:03:10] your faith
[1:03:12] don't you heard what I just told you I
[1:03:16] say let's go to the other side
[1:03:21] he say that he mean it and he did it
[1:03:26] this thumb did not stop him no
[1:03:31] when he when God says something
[1:03:34] he's really mean it people
[1:03:36] oh my
[1:03:39] God I can think about the sick man 38
[1:03:42] years I think he was sick
[1:03:47] the world make flesh walk beside him and
[1:03:50] ask him
[1:03:52] will you be
[1:03:54] would you like to be healed
[1:03:59] and he say
[1:04:01] oh
[1:04:03] I try so many times
[1:04:06] to get to the pool
[1:04:12] come on I can say Jesus face
[1:04:15] and say that's not what I asked
[1:04:21] I asked
[1:04:23] do you want to be here
[1:04:28] well
[1:04:30] maybe we started to say you know last
[1:04:34] week
[1:04:35] that was the last
[1:04:41] that wasn't the question
[1:04:44] do you want it to be healed
[1:04:49] yeah but
[1:04:52] because you know my mama told me
[1:04:56] my father told me
[1:05:03] that wasn't the question
[1:05:06] the question is do you want to be here
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:12] and we have to to to to have a closer
[1:05:15] look to to this creature we cannot just
[1:05:18] read it and say okay God say this God no
[1:05:21] no when he say that he mean it and he's
[1:05:23] mean it for me
[1:05:25] because
[1:05:28] the thing that the the sick man didn't
[1:05:31] knew he was looking at the pool
[1:05:37] but there was a fact
[1:05:40] that take a revelation from God for he
[1:05:43] to understand that the pool become a man
[1:05:47] now
[1:05:48] and now the men
[1:05:51] that become the police telling him do
[1:05:54] you want to be here
[1:05:58] and he have all those kind of questions
[1:06:01] all kind of that all kind of this
[1:06:06] is that the way sometimes we act we
[1:06:10] react with the word of God
[1:06:14] we have so many opinions we have so many
[1:06:16] voices we have so many there's so many
[1:06:19] that
[1:06:20] my my
[1:06:22] let the mind the Western Christ be on us
[1:06:26] people
[1:06:27] we have to Quick all those voices
[1:06:31] because in this age we have one budge
[1:06:34] for us amen
[1:06:37] and that is the important one amen
[1:06:40] so when God says something
[1:06:43] he really mean it
[1:06:46] so when I when we read
[1:06:48] Jeremiah 29 verse 11.
[1:06:53] you have to find yourself in the
[1:06:55] scripture you have to find as a young
[1:06:59] Christian you have to find yourself in
[1:07:02] this creature
[1:07:04] because this creature belonged to you
[1:07:07] now you gotta seed yourself in this
[1:07:11] creature
[1:07:12] because when you don't see yourself on
[1:07:15] the scripture
[1:07:16] it's not personal
[1:07:19] you're saying that you're believing it
[1:07:21] for somebody else
[1:07:24] but when you see yourself on this
[1:07:26] creature when you say that belonged to
[1:07:29] me the Lord said it he will accomplish
[1:07:33] what he said I believe her I will stay
[1:07:36] in the world
[1:07:38] because there is a condition for God
[1:07:40] Amen
[1:07:44] for us to see the potential of God we
[1:07:47] have to to stay
[1:07:51] on the on the word of God people
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:56] even if faithful
[1:07:58] we must stay on the word of the promise
[1:08:05] God
[1:08:06] can make it happen
[1:08:10] if you let him happen
[1:08:13] because you can make it happen by
[1:08:16] yourself
[1:08:17] oh yeah
[1:08:20] let's go to Isaiah 41 I Don't Know
[1:08:24] and this morning the Sawyer that I
[1:08:27] brought I was thinking
[1:08:29] what word that I will use to express the
[1:08:33] thought that the Lord put on my heart
[1:08:36] and you know what has come to my heart
[1:08:39] I don't know if you have the
[1:08:46] I was not
[1:08:50] I laugh like you laugh
[1:08:53] I was man are you are you sure Lord
[1:08:56] Hakuna Matata
[1:09:00] I was like Hakuna Matata
[1:09:04] yeah
[1:09:06] Hakuna Matata and you all know what does
[1:09:09] that mean
[1:09:11] it means don't worry
[1:09:18] the story of the Bible to Isaiah 41
[1:09:25] let's take a look
[1:09:26] the scripture
[1:09:32] yeah Isaiah 41 verse 10 say fear thou
[1:09:37] not
[1:09:39] as you know that there is two atmosphere
[1:09:43] the atmosphere of faith
[1:09:47] and the atmosphere
[1:09:49] of Doubt or fear
[1:09:54] when we stay in the atmosphere of Faith
[1:09:57] well God will make it happen
[1:10:02] but when we are in the atmosphere of
[1:10:05] fear
[1:10:06] be careful
[1:10:09] because it's us
[1:10:11] making it happen
[1:10:13] and when it's us making it happen
[1:10:17] we can make a lot of mistake
[1:10:20] and you know each let's say each
[1:10:23] decision we bring their own result
[1:10:28] sometimes the result
[1:10:30] they're not good
[1:10:32] when we made decision by ourself
[1:10:36] the result
[1:10:37] become headache
[1:10:40] for years and years
[1:10:43] so
[1:10:45] what I can say
[1:10:51] in the atmosphere of faith
[1:10:54] to make sure
[1:10:56] that you have Hakuna Matata
[1:11:00] and your life
[1:11:02] because when you do it by yourself
[1:11:04] trust me
[1:11:06] you won't be singing Hakuna Matata
[1:11:13] in the atmosphere of faith God will make
[1:11:15] it happen in the atmosphere
[1:11:18] of fear
[1:11:22] we will make it happen
[1:11:24] now one of the virtue
[1:11:26] of the atmosphere of fear is to make us
[1:11:30] make bad decision
[1:11:35] when you're scared when you fear in
[1:11:38] front of something
[1:11:40] comma
[1:11:42] you're going to make a lot of a lot of
[1:11:45] mistake
[1:11:46] that's why you have to make sure amen
[1:11:49] even the prophet say when you say when
[1:11:52] you do something without it's a thing
[1:11:57] so you better know what you're doing
[1:11:59] what you're choosing in life
[1:12:02] now let's say somebody
[1:12:06] a young boy and church
[1:12:10] he said that his friends
[1:12:12] are getting married
[1:12:14] but it's not getting married
[1:12:17] and then he don't see no
[1:12:19] sister in church for him
[1:12:23] he's starting to get
[1:12:26] fear
[1:12:27] because now he's getting tired that he
[1:12:31] will not find someone to get married
[1:12:36] and what happened the devil said that
[1:12:42] and then the devil can put the wrong
[1:12:44] person and by fear you shoot that person
[1:12:47] because you're thinking if you don't
[1:12:49] take that person you won't have any more
[1:12:52] choice
[1:12:55] that's why it's pretty Spartan
[1:12:58] to to to to to to to to to know when God
[1:13:01] says something
[1:13:03] he will make it happen
[1:13:07] it's really important for us as a Young
[1:13:09] Brother John's sister to know the our
[1:13:13] ideas our project and our presence and
[1:13:17] future life they are already in God
[1:13:20] hands
[1:13:23] the prophet of God said that the first
[1:13:26] decision that God take
[1:13:30] have to be the perfect one he cannot
[1:13:33] change it because if he change it he
[1:13:36] made a mistake in the first place
[1:13:38] and we can see with God we can see God
[1:13:42] in nation with his first son Adam
[1:13:45] he he give out and everything that he
[1:13:48] needed he gave him a house he gave him a
[1:13:51] wife he give everything to take care of
[1:13:54] it
[1:13:55] and he and if that was the first the
[1:13:59] system of God every time that God will
[1:14:02] have another son he will have to do the
[1:14:06] same team again
[1:14:09] oh my
[1:14:12] God praise be to God
[1:14:14] I love God
[1:14:16] amen
[1:14:20] so by fear
[1:14:22] he gonna choose the wrong one
[1:14:25] and that Mary will turn to a headache
[1:14:29] because from the beginning the Lord said
[1:14:31] I will put enemity
[1:14:34] between those two seeds
[1:14:37] and if you buy fear you took the wrong
[1:14:41] seed
[1:14:43] you won't be singing Hakuna Matata
[1:14:52] we can say the same thing choosing a
[1:14:54] career
[1:14:57] sometimes we go with the flow
[1:15:00] we go with the wave
[1:15:02] everybody's taking technology so oh my I
[1:15:06] better take
[1:15:09] um
[1:15:11] maybe they thought that God has for you
[1:15:13] is not the same
[1:15:16] so you gotta go beside God to see the
[1:15:21] project that our God already have for
[1:15:24] you young brother and for you young
[1:15:27] sister
[1:15:28] amen
[1:15:30] we cannot go in the way of the world no
[1:15:34] we have to go on the way of this
[1:15:36] creature
[1:15:37] the creature have power the creature
[1:15:40] have by the well by the holy ghost that
[1:15:43] isn't us we have a channel called
[1:15:46] revelation God can talk to us God can
[1:15:50] reveal himself to us
[1:15:52] amen that's why we are son and daughter
[1:15:54] of God
[1:15:56] amen we continue to read in Isaiah 41
[1:16:01] say fear that not for Ayah with thee be
[1:16:05] not dismayed
[1:16:07] so this may mean
[1:16:10] I don't know if we can go to the
[1:16:12] definition he say it's my main
[1:16:15] experiencing or showing feeling of
[1:16:18] alarming concern or dismay
[1:16:21] is say upset
[1:16:24] worry
[1:16:28] or agitated because of some unwelcome
[1:16:32] situation of of currency
[1:16:35] and let me tell you this when you have
[1:16:38] when you are worry or agitated about a
[1:16:41] negative situation that means you're
[1:16:45] lacking of Revelation
[1:16:47] you have a lack of Revelation as your
[1:16:50] life that's why you have to find
[1:16:52] yourself in the scripture
[1:16:56] because the scripture become how you say
[1:16:59] um
[1:17:03] how to say this word
[1:17:06] the scripture have to become
[1:17:10] an absolute
[1:17:12] I don't know if I said it good
[1:17:15] you know I have three language and I
[1:17:17] have in my brain
[1:17:19] so if you heard a word in Spanish just
[1:17:22] say Amen
[1:17:23] if you heard a word in French just say
[1:17:26] amen and creole say a man but one thing
[1:17:30] I'm sure that you understand the thought
[1:17:32] of God today
[1:17:34] amen
[1:17:36] the world have to become an absolute
[1:17:40] whatever the God God say
[1:17:43] we have to say Amen
[1:17:45] that's why we've received the Holy Ghost
[1:17:48] and I love something brother Danny that
[1:17:50] the prophet say about Abraham he say it
[1:17:54] wasn't Abraham that believed the Lord
[1:17:57] it was the Holy Ghost in Abraham
[1:18:01] that's why we have to feed the Holy
[1:18:03] Ghost
[1:18:04] we have to make a a life in our life
[1:18:08] for him to shoot for us to guide us he
[1:18:12] is the guide amen hallelujah
[1:18:15] oh I'm feeling religious just now
[1:18:18] my my mind
[1:18:22] so when you worry
[1:18:27] you cannot say hakuna matata
[1:18:32] you worry
[1:18:34] kuna matata mean no worry
[1:18:37] that means God said it that's it
[1:18:41] it's done
[1:18:43] finish
[1:18:44] I don't care about the situation I don't
[1:18:46] care about the the the the the the
[1:18:48] circumstances
[1:18:51] no no no no no no no no no God said it
[1:18:54] he will make a way
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:18:57] when God say that nobody can stop him
[1:19:01] he said that he made it he make it
[1:19:04] happen amen
[1:19:07] I love Lord
[1:19:10] my my
[1:19:14] said for I the word
[1:19:18] yam thy God
[1:19:21] I the world

[1:19:29] will help thee
[1:19:31] yeah I the word will uphold thee with
[1:19:37] the right hand on my righteousness
[1:19:40] it's all about the word
[1:19:43] and the word become flesh and the person
[1:19:46] of Jesus Christ
[1:19:47] and if and that person is the same
[1:19:50] person of the Holy Ghost that you have
[1:19:53] inside of you young people
[1:19:57] and that Holy Ghost only feed on the
[1:20:00] world

[1:20:15] my my
[1:20:17] let's see close to the the power
[1:20:21] of the word of God
[1:20:24] and the spoken word
[1:20:26] is the Original Seed the prophets say
[1:20:29] amen but the original
[1:20:33] got life
[1:20:36] remember
[1:20:37] his preaching the spoken word is the
[1:20:41] Original Seed
[1:20:44] so what is half-life is the word of God
[1:20:47] Amen

[1:20:53] verse 11 that word will matter how can I
[1:20:58] say will manifest in my life
[1:21:01] [Applause]
[1:21:03] because what is original is what has
[1:21:06] life
[1:21:08] and if Jeremiah 29 has life
[1:21:14] it can become a reality in my life
[1:21:18] so I can say
[1:21:20] Hakuna Matata
[1:21:28] my my hope you can see it now
[1:21:33] the original have the life my my
[1:21:39] oh let's continue
[1:21:46] the prophets say again no let's go to
[1:21:49] the 92. yeah
[1:21:52] now remember every spoken word of God is
[1:21:57] The Original Seed
[1:22:00] amen God planted everything in the Earth
[1:22:05] by his word
[1:22:07] and as long as you're staying with the
[1:22:10] Original Seed it will bring itself right
[1:22:15] back
[1:22:20] that's the power of the world
[1:22:23] the word have the power to reproduce
[1:22:27] himself amen
[1:22:29] the word has the power to multiply
[1:22:31] himself
[1:22:33] and the word that we have in this age
[1:22:36] even have the power to create them
[1:22:38] [Applause]
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:22:48] my my my my my
[1:22:52] I believe nobody gonna have doubt after
[1:22:55] this service
[1:22:57] that's what I believe
[1:22:59] I believe Faith come by hearing
[1:23:03] amen
[1:23:06] my my
[1:23:09] so
[1:23:12] will breathe itself right back and
[1:23:16] reproduce itself again
[1:23:20] that's the power
[1:23:21] of the word of God
[1:23:24] that's why God in the beginning amen
[1:23:28] he said Let It Be
[1:23:31] uh a cow and a bull let it be a chicken
[1:23:35] and a
[1:23:37] and after the creation
[1:23:39] he said you know what
[1:23:41] Hakuna Matata
[1:23:47] I'm gonna take some rest now
[1:23:49] because the word that I pronounce have
[1:23:52] the power to reproduce himself
[1:23:55] [Applause]
[1:23:57] amen
[1:23:59] oh I love God
[1:24:04] my my my my
[1:24:08] God can say hakuna matata
[1:24:11] amen
[1:24:15] don't get Disturbed
[1:24:18] we all know certain copy everything
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:28] but the original
[1:24:30] house life
[1:24:32] amen
[1:24:34] why because God didn't worry about how
[1:24:39] many millions of sun he will have
[1:24:44] it's like he didn't worry if we if he
[1:24:48] has one million of son and daughter in
[1:24:51] the Earth
[1:24:52] and just one chicken
[1:24:54] and one
[1:24:56] no no
[1:24:58] he knew that his work have the power to
[1:25:02] reproduce himself
[1:25:04] he knew that it will reproduce more to
[1:25:08] play
[1:25:09] amen
[1:25:12] that's why Noah
[1:25:17] you just need a pair
[1:25:20] of each animal
[1:25:22] no more than that
[1:25:24] because those animals were the speaking
[1:25:28] work
[1:25:30] of God
[1:25:34] the creation have the power to reproduce
[1:25:40] because come from the word of God
[1:25:45] that's why a job
[1:25:49] when he lose everything
[1:25:53] he said
[1:25:54] the Lord have given
[1:25:56] the Lord have taken amen
[1:25:58] praise be to God
[1:26:01] why
[1:26:03] because he knew he had the Revelation
[1:26:06] that the word of God have the power to
[1:26:09] reproduce again
[1:26:12] the only worry that he had but the Danny
[1:26:15] is to stay on the word
[1:26:20] because he knew if he said on the word
[1:26:23] the word have the power to give him back
[1:26:26] his sons
[1:26:28] oh my I love God
[1:26:31] man
[1:26:41] why because the power
[1:26:44] of the word of God to reproduce to
[1:26:47] multiply
[1:26:49] and even to create to fulfill
[1:26:53] our needs
[1:26:57] there is no situation there is no
[1:27:00] circumstances too hard for God
[1:27:04] the word of God have the power
[1:27:06] to go across situation
[1:27:10] my my my
[1:27:14] mind
[1:27:15] oh I loved
[1:27:17] I love Jesus
[1:27:22] and the mentioned Shalom the prophet
[1:27:25] saying
[1:27:26] now good morning
[1:27:28] mean peace
[1:27:31] Darkness amen
[1:27:33] is gated him Gathering
[1:27:37] amen
[1:27:40] why he's getting for
[1:27:42] to show
[1:27:44] the light
[1:27:45] listen
[1:27:47] Isaiah
[1:27:48] 60 verse 1 say write and Shine for the
[1:27:54] light is come to you
[1:27:57] the reason I can say shalom and is
[1:28:01] familiar with Hakuna Matata because both
[1:28:06] mean peace both mean don't worry
[1:28:10] amen
[1:28:11] the light has come to you
[1:28:14] God peace to the elected woman to the
[1:28:19] elected lady those who God
[1:28:23] before the foundation of the word will
[1:28:26] call it out and all done it to that
[1:28:31] that's your people
[1:28:33] that's us
[1:28:35] God have call it loud
[1:28:39] of all that getting that we sing in the
[1:28:42] world right now
[1:28:44] we're seeing
[1:28:45] the gay BC aldeny God gated him
[1:28:48] we see the denomination gated
[1:28:52] all the darkness
[1:28:55] the getting together
[1:28:59] what did that what effect do that make
[1:29:04] listen
[1:29:07] before
[1:29:09] that the situation or the world come
[1:29:13] like he is right now
[1:29:16] before we used to be like
[1:29:19] let's say in 10 Christian
[1:29:23] you can say seven of them real belief
[1:29:27] Christ
[1:29:29] but now because of the darkness
[1:29:33] out of 10 we can say one or two
[1:29:39] so the other eight
[1:29:42] they get it together they get together
[1:29:46] but at the same time God is calling you
[1:29:51] to the light of his word
[1:29:55] and the prophet said wow the the word is
[1:29:59] falling apart
[1:30:01] for the elected we can say shalom
[1:30:10] that means peace
[1:30:12] that means Hakuna Matata
[1:30:15] because the word that we receive in this
[1:30:18] age have the power to take care of us
[1:30:23] natural and spiritual
[1:30:26] as one of the other on your church you
[1:30:29] know those really Christians they stay
[1:30:32] on the word ask them if they ever mix
[1:30:35] something
[1:30:37] ask them when the law let them uh uh uh
[1:30:41] amend let let them down in a problem
[1:30:45] never
[1:30:49] God take care of us
[1:30:53] foreign
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:56] was saying the same God that we had as a
[1:31:00] father is the same God that you have
[1:31:03] as a young Christian
[1:31:06] it's not a different God it's all
[1:31:08] another condition of God you are under
[1:31:11] the same Covenant of God
[1:31:14] if all the problem was true for me
[1:31:17] brother Kadri brother Danny and all the
[1:31:20] other orders are they are right here
[1:31:22] this morning
[1:31:25] does promise
[1:31:27] as true for you too
[1:31:31] God cannot change the same way he take
[1:31:34] care of he will take care of you people
[1:31:39] oh I love this
[1:31:42] amen
[1:31:45] and like
[1:31:47] brother kaju used to say
[1:31:49] I'm about to close
[1:31:57] oh my but the restoration of the word
[1:32:01] in this age we can come back to our
[1:32:04] reality
[1:32:07] to our original World War
[1:32:13] because the lion of the tribal of Judah
[1:32:16] have overcome for us
[1:32:20] he fight the fight
[1:32:22] just like brother Cadre described it
[1:32:24] last night
[1:32:26] he filled the paint
[1:32:28] he filled the worries
[1:32:30] he feel everything that we feel
[1:32:33] to be a faithful father father
[1:32:37] oh man
[1:32:39] we don't miss nothing
[1:32:41] we don't have to go outside on the World
[1:32:44] to seek for something everything that we
[1:32:48] need is on the word of God
[1:32:51] amen
[1:32:54] my mind
[1:32:55] and Ecclesiastes
[1:32:58] 3 verse 15.
[1:33:08] the word of God say
[1:33:12] that which has been is now
[1:33:17] and I wish to be had already been
[1:33:23] and God required it that wishes pass
[1:33:29] so here the word is going talking about
[1:33:31] cycle
[1:33:33] and life
[1:33:35] what it is have been already
[1:33:38] it's nothing new
[1:33:40] it's your cycle
[1:33:42] repeating cycle
[1:33:44] in this age
[1:33:46] we have a cycle
[1:33:52] they say if we have a cycle
[1:33:58] and this cycle starts with Elijah
[1:34:03] everybody knows Elijah amen
[1:34:10] continuing to fulfill the cycle
[1:34:15] we have Ahab
[1:34:18] interpersonality of John F Kennedy
[1:34:23] we continue
[1:34:27] no I'm telling you so repeating cycle
[1:34:32] you have Jezebel
[1:34:36] system
[1:34:41] continue to do the cycle
[1:34:45] we have the son of my woman
[1:34:52] you know that testimony about the the
[1:34:55] black sister
[1:34:59] his son sick she was praying all night
[1:35:03] and she said unto the Lord
[1:35:06] I'm a type of the son of my woman
[1:35:09] if I am a type of the son of my woman
[1:35:12] there must be a type of a liar
[1:35:18] you know what you did
[1:35:19] she just find herself in the scripture
[1:35:25] and if God is still the same if you find
[1:35:29] yourself as a young person and the
[1:35:31] scripture of Jeremiah 29 you know what I
[1:35:35] mean
[1:35:36] Hakuna Matata
[1:35:38] you won't be worrying about the present
[1:35:40] and the future
[1:35:42] because my future is on his hand
[1:35:45] amen
[1:35:47] oh my what a beautiful position
[1:35:51] amen
[1:35:53] so
[1:35:55] we have seen this sister
[1:35:58] she has the Revelation that Elijah is
[1:36:01] coming
[1:36:03] so she stay on the door the front of the
[1:36:06] door
[1:36:07] she's like that
[1:36:13] suddenly
[1:36:17] said amen
[1:36:20] and you know God worked both sides
[1:36:24] do you know the history
[1:36:27] which talked to brother Brown and she
[1:36:30] say
[1:36:31] good morning Pastor
[1:36:38] like
[1:36:40] who me
[1:36:45] and you know
[1:36:46] that sister we're here this morning
[1:36:49] she will say yeah you
[1:37:00] you know how we talk
[1:37:06] and then
[1:37:10] tell brother Brannan
[1:37:16] I have a son that is sick I pray for him
[1:37:19] all all night long
[1:37:21] and I am a kind I am a type of the son
[1:37:25] of my woman
[1:37:33] and if I'm a type of the son of my woman
[1:37:35] there must be a type of Elijah
[1:37:39] so the Holy Ghost rebuild me that Elijah
[1:37:41] is coming this morning
[1:37:55] she was a type
[1:37:58] for us to understand the cycle
[1:38:04] but that is once missing
[1:38:10] we continue
[1:38:13] who's missing
[1:38:22] somebody's missing in the cycle
[1:38:28] who is that person
[1:38:32] is the Widow
[1:38:37] to complete the cycle
[1:38:40] now us
[1:38:44] we represent the Veda
[1:38:48] now the prophet of God said and that
[1:38:51] religion
[1:38:52] of uh
[1:38:54] Jezebel tradition look what he said
[1:39:00] and when he did
[1:39:02] her husband has died
[1:39:05] her organization died
[1:39:08] so now she is ready to hurt the prophet
[1:39:13] amen
[1:39:19] our all life have to die
[1:39:23] our old system has to die
[1:39:28] for us to receive
[1:39:32] a prophet
[1:39:33] or tourists the prophet represents the
[1:39:36] word of God
[1:39:38] the message of the hour
[1:39:43] so when the prophet come to the gate and
[1:39:46] ask her
[1:39:48] for a lot of water
[1:39:50] she went to get it
[1:39:54] then he said
[1:39:56] bring me a muscle of meal
[1:39:59] and she turned it and say
[1:40:02] as the Lord lived
[1:40:04] I don't have nothing but just
[1:40:08] enough
[1:40:12] and that's how we feel
[1:40:15] when God
[1:40:17] is calling us
[1:40:19] to do a step forward through him
[1:40:23] we feel that we're going to lose the
[1:40:26] only friends that we have
[1:40:29] we feel that we want to lose the little
[1:40:33] enough that we have in our life
[1:40:40] but the prophet say
[1:40:44] now it's look like
[1:40:46] he was sent to take what letter she had
[1:40:52] but it was by subversa
[1:40:59] sometimes we made a mistake
[1:41:02] to put our effort
[1:41:05] our work
[1:41:08] and our own mindset
[1:41:16] it won't work
[1:41:19] if you are a son or a daughter of God
[1:41:22] it won't work brother
[1:41:24] it won't work sister
[1:41:27] make sure that you put you all you have
[1:41:31] on the word of God
[1:41:34] because God already have the plane
[1:41:38] usually have to give yourself to God
[1:41:41] and he will make it happen
[1:41:45] you might say but brother I don't see
[1:41:47] any brother in my church
[1:41:49] we just say the word of God have the
[1:41:52] power
[1:41:53] to reproduce or to multiply and even
[1:41:57] create a broader for you
[1:41:59] amen
[1:42:01] let's just stay on the word
[1:42:05] now
[1:42:06] we feel like that
[1:42:08] brothers and sister we feel that the
[1:42:11] letter that we have
[1:42:14] when God asks that
[1:42:17] it's like we're gonna lose everything
[1:42:21] but it ain't like that
[1:42:24] no no you know the best company the best
[1:42:27] company ever
[1:42:30] is the kingdom of God
[1:42:33] it's the only company that you can
[1:42:35] invest
[1:42:36] a bottle of water
[1:42:38] and you will have
[1:42:40] uh uh a reward for that
[1:42:47] if you put your life on the hand of God
[1:42:52] he will make it happen
[1:42:54] he just need you to give whatever you
[1:42:58] have
[1:42:59] whatever you are
[1:43:01] just give it to the Lord
[1:43:04] and he will take care of the rest
[1:43:07] don't try to make it happen by yourself
[1:43:10] by your idea no a son and daughter of
[1:43:15] God we have to let God make it happen
[1:43:20] when because when God making it happen
[1:43:25] Hakuna Matata
[1:43:27] you won't be in worries
[1:43:29] God will take care of you
[1:43:32] because this word is ordained to take
[1:43:35] care of us
[1:43:38] I'm not saying we don't have we won't
[1:43:40] have uh circumstances in life but what
[1:43:44] I'm saying the word of God is powerful
[1:43:46] it's more powerful than the
[1:43:49] circumstances
[1:43:59] when she was willing to give
[1:44:02] what she had
[1:44:04] to support of the world
[1:44:08] God feed her
[1:44:12] could you imagine
[1:44:14] that was the the only the the the last
[1:44:18] let's say the last piece of
[1:44:20] food that she had
[1:44:24] you say you know I will eat this me and
[1:44:27] my son and after that we will die
[1:44:32] she don't have nothing to to back off
[1:44:34] she don't have no one to back off her
[1:44:38] you see what I mean
[1:44:40] if the husband was there she can put her
[1:44:43] trust in the hospital
[1:44:46] that's why she was ready to receive the
[1:44:49] word
[1:44:53] that's why our idea our plan our project
[1:44:57] has to die
[1:44:59] because if they don't die
[1:45:03] we will how how can I say this we will
[1:45:07] rely on them
[1:45:11] no no God why you young people young
[1:45:14] sister Young Brother to rely on the
[1:45:17] world of God
[1:45:20] because the word of God
[1:45:23] have the power to make it
[1:45:27] amen
[1:45:32] so when she was willing to give
[1:45:35] what she had to support of the world
[1:45:39] God fear
[1:45:40] and if you are willing to give what a
[1:45:44] spirit you do have why spirit that God
[1:45:47] have gave you to support of the world
[1:45:50] then God will keep you alive
[1:45:57] [Applause]
[1:46:01] that's the problem for God for us
[1:46:04] today
[1:46:06] he's here to take care
[1:46:09] of us
[1:46:11] the same way the same God that take care
[1:46:15] of your parents
[1:46:17] he wants to take care of you guys
[1:46:22] but we have to be able
[1:46:25] to give him whatever we have
[1:46:29] my my
[1:46:38] hallelujah oh glory to God did you see a
[1:46:41] church
[1:46:42] don't think I am beside myself I'm not
[1:46:46] but why you got what you have got
[1:46:49] what letter you do believe in God
[1:46:53] what faith you have got
[1:46:56] place it on the word
[1:47:02] and if God doesn't change
[1:47:05] the same way brother Danny
[1:47:08] the
[1:47:10] the word of God take care of the wider
[1:47:18] and if if I repeat in cycle and we know
[1:47:22] that it's a repeating cycle
[1:47:25] God will have to work or make the same
[1:47:30] thing that he does in the past
[1:47:34] if we don't do it
[1:47:37] the first
[1:47:39] idea of the first creation that he has
[1:47:41] it wasn't the truth
[1:47:45] God the Bro the prophet of God said if
[1:47:48] someone is sick
[1:47:50] like
[1:47:51] they say a thousand years ago
[1:47:56] and today why not the Son of God
[1:47:58] daughter of God is sick and you find
[1:48:01] yourself in the same situation with the
[1:48:04] same faith
[1:48:05] God have to respond the same way
[1:48:09] if we are in the same situation of the
[1:48:13] Wida
[1:48:14] and if we give whatever later whatever
[1:48:18] left we have
[1:48:20] to the word of God
[1:48:23] the word is of God will take care of us
[1:48:29] when the word of God take care of us we
[1:48:32] can say hakuna
[1:48:35] Matata May the law bless you amen
[1:48:48] Lord thank you

[2:01:53] scripture then you can apply that
[2:01:55] promise to you amen praise God I was you
[2:01:59] know I was thinking about Daniel in the
[2:02:01] Bible you know Daniel was just a
[2:02:03] teenager
[2:02:04] you know a
[2:02:07] Meshach and Shadrach and have been they
[2:02:10] were just teenagers they were Daniel's
[2:02:12] friends and they were living in in a day
[2:02:15] where where everything was against them
[2:02:17] amen and they were young people that
[2:02:20] could be identified you can be
[2:02:21] identified with them amen when we think
[2:02:24] of them they were showing certain
[2:02:26] characteristics
[2:02:28] about uh uh Christ they were showing
[2:02:32] certain characteristics in their lives
[2:02:34] that gave them overcoming power to to to
[2:02:37] set a standard in the day that they were
[2:02:40] living amen because they identified with
[2:02:43] the word amen when they were there they
[2:02:46] had identified that Daniel showed that
[2:02:48] he had values amen you young people you
[2:02:52] need to set and have values in your life
[2:02:55] you need to identify with with certain
[2:02:58] values that you're not going to bow down
[2:03:01] to the king of Babylon amen there's
[2:03:04] another king in the land that calls
[2:03:06] himself the king of this world but
[2:03:08] you're not to bow down to that King
[2:03:09] because you are Sons and Daughters of
[2:03:12] the Living God Amen you're not to eat
[2:03:14] their food they were trying to force
[2:03:16] Daniel to eat their food drink their
[2:03:18] drink drink their alcohol
[2:03:21] when your friends are calling you and
[2:03:23] say hey we're going to smoke marijuana
[2:03:26] they had values they stood back and they
[2:03:29] stood upon the values that had been laid
[2:03:31] upon them in their hearts and you can do
[2:03:34] the same thing you can have those same
[2:03:36] kind of values in this day and identify
[2:03:40] yourself with the word of God Amen
[2:03:43] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they had
[2:03:45] courage
[2:03:47] and you need to have courage to stand
[2:03:49] against The Wiles of this Dimension that
[2:03:52] we're living in right now
[2:03:53] you need to have the courage to say no
[2:03:56] to the gods of this world
[2:03:59] they want you to bow down to all kinds
[2:04:01] of gods they want you to bow down to uh
[2:04:04] uh identity crisis they want you to
[2:04:07] identify with with all kinds of
[2:04:09] different identities in this life
[2:04:11] you need to identify yourself with the
[2:04:13] word of God Amen praise God that's our
[2:04:16] identity that's what gives us the power
[2:04:19] to overcome and they have the courage to
[2:04:21] trust their God in that day even when
[2:04:25] they said that you gotta bow down or
[2:04:28] you're going into a fiery furnace
[2:04:30] they said we're not bowing down
[2:04:32] because the god that we serve the god
[2:04:35] that you serve can keep you from drugs
[2:04:38] the god that you serve can keep you from
[2:04:41] identifying with the God of this world
[2:04:43] identifying with the things of this
[2:04:45] world Amen praise God they had integrity
[2:04:49] they could not find fault in Daniel
[2:04:52] because he had the Integrity of his God
[2:04:55] he believed in what he stood for they
[2:04:59] couldn't find any fault in him they
[2:05:01] looked for fault they tried to find a
[2:05:03] way to to to break him down and to get
[2:05:06] him to deny his God but he would not do
[2:05:09] it because he had Integrity amen praise
[2:05:13] God glory to God he displayed he
[2:05:17] displayed a a spirit of Excellence
[2:05:20] because there's too many people in this
[2:05:22] world today and too many young people
[2:05:24] they're they're giving up too easy
[2:05:26] they're not willing to go all the way
[2:05:28] they're not willing to to have a a life
[2:05:31] of excellence and and and be somebody
[2:05:35] that that has the Integrity that has the
[2:05:38] spiritual courage and the spiritual
[2:05:40] discipline to choose the right friends
[2:05:43] amen we need to identify ourselves with
[2:05:46] those that are in the Bible that stood
[2:05:49] for the word of God and did great things
[2:05:52] because the same God that was with
[2:05:55] Daniel Meshach Shadrach and Abednego is
[2:05:59] with you in this day and in this hour if
[2:06:02] you will stand on the word of God in the
[2:06:04] same way
[2:06:06] king of Babylon when he saw what the god
[2:06:09] that stood behind Shadrach Meshach and
[2:06:12] abednegal could do and that he could
[2:06:15] keep them in the fiery furnace God can
[2:06:17] keep you through those trials God can
[2:06:19] keep you through those circumstances God
[2:06:21] can keep you through whatever it is that
[2:06:23] you might think is overcoming you but
[2:06:26] you stand on the word of God regardless
[2:06:28] and God will meet you in that fire God
[2:06:32] will be with you God will give you the
[2:06:34] power to overcome and when the king of
[2:06:37] Babylon saw what the what the what the
[2:06:40] god of of Meshach and Shadrach and
[2:06:42] Abednego could do he told them this is
[2:06:45] the true and living God Amen and when
[2:06:47] your friends see you living for this
[2:06:50] Gospel of believing this word and
[2:06:53] believing that God has sent us a prophet
