[22:07] going to be a brief
[22:09] experation basically uh recognizing what
[22:12] you have and everything that you're
[22:14] going through in your life has a purpose
[22:16] while you're going through what you go
[22:17] through um it's not you're not called by
[22:21] chance uh into this message right so
[22:24] you're not called by chance so let's bow
[22:26] our heads we'll pray and we'll begin
[22:29] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[22:30] love your mercy and your grace Lord
[22:32] thank you for those gathered those
[22:34] represented here tonight Lord Jesus you
[22:36] bring us into a greater realization of
[22:39] our purpose in life what you placed in
[22:40] our hearts in the way of gifts Lord
[22:43] Jesus and father that uh gifts and
[22:47] callings are about repentance Lord God
[22:49] but we just got to give our gifts to you
[22:50] Lord that you can bring it to your full
[22:52] bring it to the full potential of why
[22:54] you have us here Lord you gave us you
[22:56] give it you gave our gifts in our lives
[22:59] for a reason for a purpose Lord and it's
[23:00] up to us to to give it to you or to keep
[23:03] it within ourselves Lord bless each and
[23:05] everyone here tonight blessed speaker
[23:07] Lord God hearers Lord God just let it be
[23:10] may your Holy Spirit just flow and just
[23:11] have thine own way Lord take control in
[23:13] Jesus Christ's name amen so it said here
[23:18] and Saul's servant said unto him behold
[23:21] now an evil spirit from the Lord
[23:22] troubleth thee let our Lord command thee
[23:26] oh sorry s all right let our Lord Now
[23:30] command thy servants which are before
[23:32] thee to seek out a man who is a cunning
[23:35] player out of heart cunning not just a
[23:37] player but a cunning player so he's
[23:38] refined he's been refined and it shall
[23:41] come to pass when the evil spirit from
[23:43] the Lord is upon thee that he shall play
[23:45] with his hand and thou shalt be
[23:48] well so Saul had mental illness so which
[23:52] is a key very very uh lot lot of uh the
[23:56] situations that we go through or not we
[23:58] as a whole but society as a whole is
[24:00] mental illness related right so I want
[24:03] to point something out to you guys very
[24:05] significant okay and Saul said to his
[24:08] servants provide me now a man that can
[24:10] play well not just play but play well
[24:14] right play well that's very key and
[24:16] bring him to me then answered one of his
[24:18] servants and said behold I have seen the
[24:20] son of Jesse the B bethlehemite try to
[24:24] say that 10 times fast that that is uh
[24:28] play and a mighty Valiant man and a man
[24:31] of war and prudent in matters and a
[24:34] calmly person and the Lord is with him
[24:37] wherefore Saul sent Messengers unto
[24:38] Jesse and said send me David thy son
[24:41] which is with the sheep and Jesse took
[24:44] an ass Laden with bread and a bottle
[24:46] with wine and a kid and sent them by
[24:49] David his son unto Saul and
[24:54] David and David came to Saul and stood
[24:58] before him and he loved him greatly and
[25:00] he became his armor
[25:02] Bearer and Saul said to Jesse saying let
[25:05] David I pray thee stand before me for he
[25:08] ha found favor in my sight and it came
[25:10] to pass when the evil spirit came from
[25:12] God which which came from God was upon
[25:15] Saul that David took the har and played
[25:17] with his hand so Saul was refreshed and
[25:19] was well and the evil spirit departed
[25:21] from him amen let's bow our heads father
[25:24] we thank you once again for the reading
[25:25] of your word Lord may they see the
[25:27] simplicity
[25:29] but yet the power of their gifts Lord
[25:31] God In The Name of Jesus Christ bless
[25:33] them may everyone be blessed and
[25:35] strengthened by your spirit Lord wash us
[25:37] cover us under all under the blood
[25:39] father in Jesus Christ's name amen and
[25:41] amen amen amen
[25:44] so when you listen to music refining
[25:46] your gifts refining your gifts m music
[25:49] usually gets people into a mental state
[25:52] right music gets people into a mental
[25:53] state whether a good one or a bad one
[25:55] and your gifts in particular giving unto
[25:58] the Lord you sing unto the Lord you
[26:00] Worship the Lord
[26:02] right it's different because you're
[26:05] you're worshiping God when you worship
[26:09] God you bring people into a mental state
[26:12] where they can be able to receive Faith
[26:16] they receive their Deliverance of
[26:17] whatever they're going through right and
[26:20] brother B mentioned the right mental
[26:21] state towards any promise of the word of
[26:24] God will make it come to pass any Divine
[26:26] promise of the word of God will make it
[26:27] come to pass but your job or your your
[26:31] purpose is getting people's mindset
[26:33] ready to receive their
[26:35] Deliverance that's how important it is
[26:38] right you might even think that that is
[26:41] that uh important but you have a
[26:43] Ministry too so everything that you be
[26:46] may be going through in your life all
[26:48] your mistakes everything that you're
[26:50] going through the Temptations the trials
[26:51] the situations the
[26:53] disappointments uh the isolations that
[26:55] you might be going through and amen
[26:58] everything that you may be dealing with
[27:00] as young people God is using that to
[27:03] refine you and if you're gifted and to
[27:05] sing gifted to to in any way possible
[27:09] play instruments like that it's God uses
[27:13] that to minister to other people amen
[27:16] amen
[27:19] amen praise the
[27:24] Lord and in the way of
[27:28] okay how many people take science isn't
[27:31] know about uh isn't Tak science right
[27:34] okay how many know people know about
[27:36] atoms and molecules and how they they
[27:39] vibrate right
[27:42] so this is vibrating right now by atoms
[27:45] and molecules Etc right the walls
[27:47] vibrating you can hear my voice it sends
[27:49] up the vibration right sends out a VI
[27:52] vibration you hear my voice now when you
[27:55] sing it sends out a vibration the beach
[27:58] bo uh s um um what do you call it uh
[28:03] yeah
[28:04] exactly those those uh a rock and roll
[28:08] band back in the days older days they
[28:11] they sang a song good good good good
[28:14] vibration right I'm not singer sorry
[28:18] so so good comes from the word God right
[28:23] good from the comes from the word God so
[28:25] my voice is carrying out a vibration now
[28:28] now they have a they actually in the
[28:30] medical field they have a a um they have
[28:33] a science called vibrational
[28:35] therapy I don't know if anybody's heard
[28:37] of that anybody heard of vibrational
[28:39] therapy before right so all your just
[28:41] say all of your okay everyone's giving
[28:45] off vibration right all your organs in
[28:47] your body has a different vibration
[28:50] let's just say um your liver is not
[28:53] doing too well or any organ in your body
[28:55] is not doing too well they'll get you
[28:58] this machine and whatever your whatever
[29:02] the vibrational level of the that
[29:04] particular organ is they will hook you
[29:07] up to that machine and that will they
[29:09] will send that
[29:10] vibration towards that organ in order to
[29:14] bring it up to that level where it's
[29:16] equal it's supposed to be vibrating at
[29:18] that equal level so if you're sick
[29:21] you're if that organ is sick it's
[29:23] actually vibrating at a lower level than
[29:25] normal so that machine was supposed to
[29:27] send VI ation out to bringing it up to a
[29:29] level where it's functioning normal and
[29:31] it's actually will be
[29:33] healed now from that standpoint when you
[29:37] give your gifts and talents to the Lord
[29:40] we in prayer we go through situations
[29:41] especially when you prayer when you pray
[29:44] before you start your
[29:46] ministry you're bringing God's going to
[29:49] take your voice and bring it to a
[29:51] different level he can pray he can sing
[29:53] right through you right so how do you
[29:57] know that you someone's Deliverance is

[31:05] word of words to a
[31:07] song
[31:10] right all right let me see in closing
[31:14] brief exhortation very
[31:16] brief praise the
[31:19] Lord y all okay
[31:22] today yes yes sir all right it's okay I
[31:25] know it's like Saturday evening you know
[31:29] I just want to chill out
[31:32] relax but I want to read something very
[31:36] significant okay very significant in 2
[31:39] Kings chap
[31:41] 5 verse 1- 2 actually 1 to three talks
[31:45] about Nam a general of the Syrian
[31:50] Army famous General he had leprosy and
[31:53] back then it was incurable incurable
[31:55] disease back then leprosy that's it you
[31:58] can't you know it's uh it's like one of
[32:01] the incurable diseases that they have
[32:03] today says here now non captain of the
[32:06] host of the king of Syria was a great
[32:09] man with his master and
[32:11] honorable because by him the Lord had
[32:13] deliverance from Syria he was also a
[32:16] mighty man in Valor but he was a
[32:19] leper and the syrians had gone out by
[32:22] companies and brought away captive out
[32:25] of the land of Israel little made you
[32:28] know the MA's name but a little maid and
[32:30] she waited on non's wife and she said to
[32:32] her unto her mistress what to what to my
[32:34] Lord that the the prophet that is in
[32:37] Samaria for he would recover him of his
[32:40] leprosy the Prophet Elijah so in other
[32:42] words she had the answer to the man's
[32:44] problem you know anybody know her
[32:48] name
[32:50] anybody
[32:51] no but she's in
[32:54] there how how insignificant is that
[32:58] right all right
[33:02] so he got the
[33:05] answer and in verse 17 it says then he
[33:08] went down and dipped himself seven times
[33:12] actually verse 14 he went down and
[33:14] dipped himself seven times in Jordan
[33:16] according to the saying of the man of
[33:18] God and his flesh became the Flesh of a
[33:21] little child but the answer came from a
[33:22] little girl to point them to the answer
[33:27] the solution don't make yourself
[33:28] insignificant or don't think you're
[33:30] insignificant or think you know what I
[33:32] mean you're more important than you
[33:33] think you are
