the Lord because without him I am nothing without him we are all nothing and tonight my topic that I'll bring is Jesus Christ is the resurrection for today that's all I want to bring and I'll bring it in such a way you you'll know why I took that uh title because a lot of people think Jesus they know Jesus Christ is yesterday but they don't know Jesus Christ is today Jesus Christ today a lot of people even in the m message lot of people don't know him because not until you are one of his own before the foundations of this world as his own bride chose you then he himself will come to you and tell you that you are one of his then he become reality to you then you know that you know is even if you don't know how to to read the Bible you don't know how to read brother Brown message he will make it plain to you that you are one of his then you become certain of God then you will know what you are talking about may the Lord bless each and every one of you I love you those that will be watching me in line you'll hear the testimony about what God has done for me and I promise the Lord wherever I stand in this world I will testify of it because I can't keep it to myself here is the first place the Lord want me to share because he brought me here to know him and always here will be my home my pastor Pastor Danny will always be my pastor Pastor no matter where I go I'll stick with him till we leave here or till God take me home I love you all may we brother Phillip come and lead us in prayer I feel the spirit of God already praise God Heavenly most gracious Eternal God when we live here we going to say not our hasand within us as he spoke to us we thank you and we love you amen amen my scripture reading first scripture I'm reading three scriptures one will be Psalm 46: 10 and the second one will be Hebrews 138 the third scripture will be John 11 21-27 so we reading three scriptures bear with me and may the Lord bless everyone of you for reading those scriptures and for you being here you are blessed to be here tonight to hear it not just from tape but you hearing it alive because God has done something that even I am blessed and you are going to be blessed I believe all my heart if you take it you are going to be blessed so the scripture read be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the heathens I will be exalted in the end the Lord of host is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge Sila let's turn to Hebrews 138 we all know it by our lips Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever okay if you have read that then you tend to this is my main scripture but because while I'll be talking I'll be using those things in those scriptures that's why I let us read that but this is my main scripture then said Mara unto Jesus Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died but I know that even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it thee Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Mar said unto him I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day he was putting it in future Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that he that believe in me though he were dead yet shall he live and what so whoever believeth and and believe in me shall never die believest thou this he said unto him yeah Lord I believe that thou are the Christ the son of the the Son of God which should come into the world please be seated you know and I know and as I said Jesus Christ my topic is Jesus Christ today is the resurrection not until you know him today as a resurrection you know nothing because when it comes to the letter you may know him in the letter you may know him in the form of brother Braham written where but not until he himself has come out from the pages of the book and begin to speak with you talk with you for you to know that he is the resurrection today he is the message today he is the one that you bowing you doing everything to today then you don't know nothing

passing I can't even lift my hand and punch the beell and I'm seeing the caner because the door is open a little bit and I'm watching them and all I could do is to lay on the bed and inside me the only thing I wanted was other brother Braham message or Christian song or my pastor preaching to me standing there preaching to me but there was none there so all I could do was what I have taken inside for the whole of my time being the house of the Lord I begin to chew it in the inside quiet and I begin to thank the Lord I begin [Music] to pray for even those that they were bringing so many people in Midnight people were coming they were on the uh uh hallway they were laying the people on the bed side by side andwhere so I my heart was even even though I'm going through pain I started to

form of a woman being sitting down there he can appear to you in many form this is not the first time I have seen the Lord but this time he came sat down in the chair and talking with me I have seen it God is my witness God of brother Abraham is my witness then I begin to understand when brother brah is preaching and he said the angel of the Lord is here he's sitting right here the pillow fire is moving right here he said I'm waiting for the angel of the Lord what do you think when when he say he's here he is seeing him like as Pastor Danny is sitting down there but the congregation were not seeing him brothers and sisters let us pour our heart you sinner watching me on the line Jesus Christ the resurrection today do you want him then come and repent Good Neighbor here there's water here we will baptize you in the name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ as Acts 2:38 said and if you believe I challenge you your life will never be the same because the God I'm talking is not just God hidden in the book form only but the God who is reality if he appear to Moses if he appear to William Braham you if you believe him and Obey him and if you are his son or his daughter he can appear to you because you may say kof is lying Matthew 58 what the does the scripture said blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see who God God is real like that but the churches has pushed him out and they are just most of them are worshiping imagination God in their mind that won't work you need God on the skin on may the Lord bless you may the Lord you are sitting here tonight you that are watching may the Lord Jesus Christ bless you if you are a Believer and you are backslider you love to stay home this is not time to stay home brother this is not time to stay home sister come to the house of the Lord receive the word the word that is coming from the pulpit is not a man speaking every single one of us that is speaking here God is hiding on the skreen you may think is the person speaking no we don't have our own mind to speak we have the mind of Christ and the mind of Christ is his word and his word is in us so when we stand in the pulpit that word begin to come out and when that word is coming out is God speaking you don't know where God will appear to you I didn't know when Pastor Simon came sister Simon I didn't know that God was going to appear to me like that but he did and since that day my wife is witnessed my daughter abigel is witness whether you believe this message or she doesn't the eye witness of her was he knew how I was so sick and he knew how when Pastor Simon came up to today I have never gone to the bed which I cannot walk I am walking I am talking I am eating I drive from here to Toronto I am walking around the neighborhood with my wife when we were coming here I drove the car I'm going to drove back tell me who did this explain to me the way I was sick who did this is my power it is Jesus Christ the resurrection today amen that is what the church need we need that if we not getting that then we should check ourself check our life you'll be depressed oppressed you can't even come to service the service will be boring for you but if
