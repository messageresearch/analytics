you to all the saints for your prayer I would like to say thank you to brother Danny and the whole church amen for his kindness amen the the Press of moment we already had right here in Toronto I wanted to say a bit Shalom to all of you from my Pastor Santana and I hope the Holy Ghost is going to continue to bless us this morning the same way that he did last night let's take our Bible and Jeremiah 29. verse 11. Jeremiah 29 verse 11. if you're there you can say Amen for I know the thoughts that I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of peace I know of evil amen to give you an expected end let's pray Lord bless your word bless this moment because this is only for your glory Lord in the name of Jesus Christ you may be seated before I start let me tell you it's a really blessed for me to share Purpose with brother cadrydex and to see Brothers three Bristol this morning you know I grew up in my Ministry watching those two guys amen every time I need a everything I need to to to know something in this message I would call very Steve Brazil and every time I feel dry in my heart I will put a sermon of brother Cadre dicks so you can imagine why at this moment mean to me amen so I just want to say that I've been blessed with their Ministry but I hope this morning they're going to be blessed with my Ministry amen so this morning the Lord is telling us that he knows it does that that he have for us amen thus of peace and of evil to give us an expectant end and there is something that we must know and the Lord is when he says something he really mean it God Is Not a Human Being to play around with words he won't say something and they've asked her squash his head and saying I don't think I'm going to be able to make it that ain't God When God Says something he he's powerful to fulfill it amen he is faithful to fulfill it amen when God said it he mean it and he can do it oh yeah I would doubt won't stop him just any system in this world will stop him when he says something he mean it and he will do it amen and I said and Isaiah 55 verse 11. the Lord said that when the when his word come out of his mouth he will not come back avoid but it will amen accomplish the purpose or he was sanded for amen so Heaven and Earth will pass but the word of God Will Remain the true amen oh I love this I talk about Peter Peter where he saw Jesus working on the water and then he said Master if it's that you make me come and walk on the water with you and Jesus said come and then he get out of the board and he started walking on the water but then he sees the Tumblers and he started doubting about it and then he is starting to go down but the important thing here is what Jesus said he said come and when he say come even if you down even if you if you falling apart he will help you to get up to get to the point because he's saying come he say that he mean it when he was on the ball with the disciple he taught the disciple let's go to the other way suddenly he starts sleeping he was tired from the ministry and then the devil make a storm the disciplegate is here destroy screaming and they started saying Lord don't you see that we dying that we're trying and then Jesus wake up and say what is your faith don't you heard what I just told you I say let's go to the other side he say that he mean it and he did it this thumb did not stop him no when he when God says something he's really mean it people oh my God I can think about the sick man 38 years I think he was sick the world make flesh walk beside him and ask him will you be would you like to be healed and he say oh I try so many times to get to the pool come on I can say Jesus face and say that's not what I asked I asked do you want to be here well maybe we started to say you know last week that was the last that wasn't the question do you want it to be healed yeah but because you know my mama told me my father told me that wasn't the question the question is do you want to be here [Music] and we have to to to to have a closer look to to this creature we cannot just read it and say okay God say this God no no when he say that he mean it and he's mean it for me because the thing that the the sick man didn't knew he was looking at the pool but there was a fact that take a revelation from God for he to understand that the pool become a man now and now the men that become the police telling him do you want to be here and he have all those kind of questions all kind of that all kind of this is that the way sometimes we act we react with the word of God we have so many opinions we have so many voices we have so many there's so many that my my let the mind the Western Christ be on us people we have to Quick all those voices because in this age we have one budge for us amen and that is the important one amen so when God says something he really mean it so when I when we read Jeremiah 29 verse 11. you have to find yourself in the scripture you have to find as a young Christian you have to find yourself in this creature because this creature belonged to you now you gotta seed yourself in this creature because when you don't see yourself on the scripture it's not personal you're saying that you're believing it for somebody else but when you see yourself on this creature when you say that belonged to me the Lord said it he will accomplish what he said I believe her I will stay in the world because there is a condition for God Amen for us to see the potential of God we have to to stay on the on the word of God people amen even if faithful we must stay on the word of the promise God can make it happen if you let him happen because you can make it happen by yourself oh yeah let's go to Isaiah 41 I Don't Know and this morning the Sawyer that I brought I was thinking what word that I will use to express the thought that the Lord put on my heart and you know what has come to my heart I don't know if you have the I was not I laugh like you laugh I was man are you are you sure Lord Hakuna Matata I was like Hakuna Matata yeah Hakuna Matata and you all know what does that mean it means don't worry the story of the Bible to Isaiah 41 let's take a look the scripture yeah Isaiah 41 verse 10 say fear thou not as you know that there is two atmosphere the atmosphere of faith and the atmosphere of Doubt or fear when we stay in the atmosphere of Faith well God will make it happen but when we are in the atmosphere of fear be careful because it's us making it happen and when it's us making it happen we can make a lot of mistake and you know each let's say each decision we bring their own result sometimes the result they're not good when we made decision by ourself the result become headache for years and years so what I can say in the atmosphere of faith to make sure that you have Hakuna Matata and your life because when you do it by yourself trust me you won't be singing Hakuna Matata in the atmosphere of faith God will make it happen in the atmosphere of fear we will make it happen now one of the virtue of the atmosphere of fear is to make us make bad decision when you're scared when you fear in front of something comma you're going to make a lot of a lot of mistake that's why you have to make sure amen even the prophet say when you say when you do something without it's a thing so you better know what you're doing what you're choosing in life now let's say somebody a young boy and church he said that his friends are getting married but it's not getting married and then he don't see no sister in church for him he's starting to get fear because now he's getting tired that he will not find someone to get married and what happened the devil said that and then the devil can put the wrong person and by fear you shoot that person because you're thinking if you don't take that person you won't have any more choice that's why it's pretty Spartan to to to to to to to to to know when God says something he will make it happen it's really important for us as a Young Brother John's sister to know the our ideas our project and our presence and future life they are already in God hands the prophet of God said that the first decision that God take have to be the perfect one he cannot change it because if he change it he made a mistake in the first place and we can see with God we can see God in nation with his first son Adam he he give out and everything that he needed he gave him a house he gave him a wife he give everything to take care of it and he and if that was the first the system of God every time that God will have another son he will have to do the same team again oh my God praise be to God I love God amen so by fear he gonna choose the wrong one and that Mary will turn to a headache because from the beginning the Lord said I will put enemity between those two seeds and if you buy fear you took the wrong seed you won't be singing Hakuna Matata we can say the same thing choosing a career sometimes we go with the flow we go with the wave everybody's taking technology so oh my I better take um maybe they thought that God has for you is not the same so you gotta go beside God to see the project that our God already have for you young brother and for you young sister amen we cannot go in the way of the world no we have to go on the way of this creature the creature have power the creature have by the well by the holy ghost that isn't us we have a channel called revelation God can talk to us God can reveal himself to us amen that's why we are son and daughter of God amen we continue to read in Isaiah 41 say fear that not for Ayah with thee be not dismayed so this may mean I don't know if we can go to the definition he say it's my main experiencing or showing feeling of alarming concern or dismay is say upset worry or agitated because of some unwelcome situation of of currency and let me tell you this when you have when you are worry or agitated about a negative situation that means you're lacking of Revelation you have a lack of Revelation as your life that's why you have to find yourself in the scripture because the scripture become how you say um how to say this word the scripture have to become an absolute I don't know if I said it good you know I have three language and I have in my brain so if you heard a word in Spanish just say Amen if you heard a word in French just say amen and creole say a man but one thing I'm sure that you understand the thought of God today amen the world have to become an absolute whatever the God God say we have to say Amen that's why we've received the Holy Ghost and I love something brother Danny that the prophet say about Abraham he say it wasn't Abraham that believed the Lord it was the Holy Ghost in Abraham that's why we have to feed the Holy Ghost we have to make a a life in our life for him to shoot for us to guide us he is the guide amen hallelujah oh I'm feeling religious just now my my mind so when you worry you cannot say hakuna matata you worry kuna matata mean no worry that means God said it that's it it's done finish I don't care about the situation I don't care about the the the the the the circumstances no no no no no no no no no God said it he will make a way [Applause] when God say that nobody can stop him he said that he made it he make it happen amen I love Lord my my said for I the word yam thy God I the world will Street them d yeah I the word will help thee yeah I the word will uphold thee with the right hand on my righteousness it's all about the word and the word become flesh and the person of Jesus Christ and if and that person is the same person of the Holy Ghost that you have inside of you young people and that Holy Ghost only feed on the world let's feed the Holy Ghost for our advantage we must feed the Holy Ghost amen my my let's see close to the the power of the word of God and the spoken word is the Original Seed the prophets say amen but the original got life remember his preaching the spoken word is the Original Seed so what is half-life is the word of God Amen so if I can put myself and Jeremiah 29 verse 11 that word will matter how can I say will manifest in my life [Applause] because what is original is what has life and if Jeremiah 29 has life it can become a reality in my life so I can say Hakuna Matata my my hope you can see it now the original have the life my my oh let's continue the prophets say again no let's go to the 92. yeah now remember every spoken word of God is The Original Seed amen God planted everything in the Earth by his word and as long as you're staying with the Original Seed it will bring itself right back that's the power of the world the word have the power to reproduce himself amen the word has the power to multiply himself and the word that we have in this age even have the power to create them [Applause] [Music] my my my my my I believe nobody gonna have doubt after this service that's what I believe I believe Faith come by hearing amen my my so will breathe itself right back and reproduce itself again that's the power of the word of God that's why God in the beginning amen he said Let It Be uh a cow and a bull let it be a chicken and a and after the creation he said you know what Hakuna Matata I'm gonna take some rest now because the word that I pronounce have the power to reproduce himself [Applause] amen oh I love God my my my my God can say hakuna matata amen don't get Disturbed we all know certain copy everything amen but the original house life amen why because God didn't worry about how many millions of sun he will have it's like he didn't worry if we if he has one million of son and daughter in the Earth and just one chicken and one no no he knew that his work have the power to reproduce himself he knew that it will reproduce more to play amen that's why Noah you just need a pair of each animal no more than that because those animals were the speaking work of God the creation have the power to reproduce because come from the word of God that's why a job when he lose everything he said the Lord have given the Lord have taken amen praise be to God why because he knew he had the Revelation that the word of God have the power to reproduce again the only worry that he had but the Danny is to stay on the word because he knew if he said on the word the word have the power to give him back his sons oh my I love God man why because the power of the word of God to reproduce to multiply and even to create to fulfill our needs there is no situation there is no circumstances too hard for God the word of God have the power to go across situation my my my mind oh I loved I love Jesus and the mentioned Shalom the prophet saying now good morning mean peace Darkness amen is gated him Gathering amen why he's getting for to show the light listen Isaiah 60 verse 1 say write and Shine for the light is come to you the reason I can say shalom and is familiar with Hakuna Matata because both mean peace both mean don't worry amen the light has come to you God peace to the elected woman to the elected lady those who God before the foundation of the word will call it out and all done it to that that's your people that's us God have call it loud of all that getting that we sing in the world right now we're seeing the gay BC aldeny God gated him we see the denomination gated all the darkness the getting together what did that what effect do that make listen before that the situation or the world come like he is right now before we used to be like let's say in 10 Christian you can say seven of them real belief Christ but now because of the darkness out of 10 we can say one or two so the other eight they get it together they get together but at the same time God is calling you to the light of his word and the prophet said wow the the word is falling apart for the elected we can say shalom that means peace that means Hakuna Matata because the word that we receive in this age have the power to take care of us natural and spiritual as one of the other on your church you know those really Christians they stay on the word ask them if they ever mix something ask them when the law let them uh uh uh amend let let them down in a problem never God take care of us foreign [Music] was saying the same God that we had as a father is the same God that you have as a young Christian it's not a different God it's all another condition of God you are under the same Covenant of God if all the problem was true for me brother Kadri brother Danny and all the other orders are they are right here this morning does promise as true for you too God cannot change the same way he take care of he will take care of you people oh I love this amen and like brother kaju used to say I'm about to close oh my but the restoration of the word in this age we can come back to our reality to our original World War because the lion of the tribal of Judah have overcome for us he fight the fight just like brother Cadre described it last night he filled the paint he filled the worries he feel everything that we feel to be a faithful father father oh man we don't miss nothing we don't have to go outside on the World to seek for something everything that we need is on the word of God amen my mind and Ecclesiastes 3 verse 15. the word of God say that which has been is now and I wish to be had already been and God required it that wishes pass so here the word is going talking about cycle and life what it is have been already it's nothing new it's your cycle repeating cycle in this age we have a cycle they say if we have a cycle and this cycle starts with Elijah everybody knows Elijah amen continuing to fulfill the cycle we have Ahab interpersonality of John F Kennedy we continue no I'm telling you so repeating cycle you have Jezebel system continue to do the cycle we have the son of my woman you know that testimony about the the black sister his son sick she was praying all night and she said unto the Lord I'm a type of the son of my woman if I am a type of the son of my woman there must be a type of a liar you know what you did she just find herself in the scripture and if God is still the same if you find yourself as a young person and the scripture of Jeremiah 29 you know what I mean Hakuna Matata you won't be worrying about the present and the future because my future is on his hand amen oh my what a beautiful position amen so we have seen this sister she has the Revelation that Elijah is coming so she stay on the door the front of the door she's like that suddenly said amen and you know God worked both sides do you know the history which talked to brother Brown and she say good morning Pastor like who me and you know that sister we're here this morning she will say yeah you you know how we talk and then tell brother Brannan I have a son that is sick I pray for him all all night long and I am a kind I am a type of the son of my woman and if I'm a type of the son of my woman there must be a type of Elijah so the Holy Ghost rebuild me that Elijah is coming this morning she was a type for us to understand the cycle but that is once missing we continue who's missing somebody's missing in the cycle who is that person is the Widow to complete the cycle now us we represent the Veda now the prophet of God said and that religion of uh Jezebel tradition look what he said and when he did her husband has died her organization died so now she is ready to hurt the prophet amen our all life have to die our old system has to die for us to receive a prophet or tourists the prophet represents the word of God the message of the hour so when the prophet come to the gate and ask her for a lot of water she went to get it then he said bring me a muscle of meal and she turned it and say as the Lord lived I don't have nothing but just enough and that's how we feel when God is calling us to do a step forward through him we feel that we're going to lose the only friends that we have we feel that we want to lose the little enough that we have in our life but the prophet say now it's look like he was sent to take what letter she had but it was by subversa sometimes we made a mistake to put our effort our work and our own mindset it won't work if you are a son or a daughter of God it won't work brother it won't work sister make sure that you put you all you have on the word of God because God already have the plane usually have to give yourself to God and he will make it happen you might say but brother I don't see any brother in my church we just say the word of God have the power to reproduce or to multiply and even create a broader for you amen let's just stay on the word now we feel like that brothers and sister we feel that the letter that we have when God asks that it's like we're gonna lose everything but it ain't like that no no you know the best company the best company ever is the kingdom of God it's the only company that you can invest a bottle of water and you will have uh uh a reward for that if you put your life on the hand of God he will make it happen he just need you to give whatever you have whatever you are just give it to the Lord and he will take care of the rest don't try to make it happen by yourself by your idea no a son and daughter of God we have to let God make it happen when because when God making it happen Hakuna Matata you won't be in worries God will take care of you because this word is ordained to take care of us I'm not saying we don't have we won't have uh circumstances in life but what I'm saying the word of God is powerful it's more powerful than the circumstances when she was willing to give what she had to support of the world God feed her could you imagine that was the the only the the the last let's say the last piece of food that she had you say you know I will eat this me and my son and after that we will die she don't have nothing to to back off she don't have no one to back off her you see what I mean if the husband was there she can put her trust in the hospital that's why she was ready to receive the word that's why our idea our plan our project has to die because if they don't die we will how how can I say this we will rely on them no no God why you young people young sister Young Brother to rely on the world of God because the word of God have the power to make it amen so when she was willing to give what she had to support of the world God fear and if you are willing to give what a spirit you do have why spirit that God have gave you to support of the world then God will keep you alive [Applause] that's the problem for God for us today he's here to take care of us the same way the same God that take care of your parents he wants to take care of you guys but we have to be able to give him whatever we have my my hallelujah oh glory to God did you see a church don't think I am beside myself I'm not but why you got what you have got what letter you do believe in God what faith you have got place it on the word and if God doesn't change the same way brother Danny the the word of God take care of the wider and if if I repeat in cycle and we know that it's a repeating cycle God will have to work or make the same thing that he does in the past if we don't do it the first idea of the first creation that he has

[Applause] [Music] amen praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus how many enjoyed that service amen praise God forevermore could you see yourself in the scripture he made some beautiful points there that you need to see but God said he will keep every promise and when you can see yourself in the scripture then you can apply that promise to you amen praise God I was you know I was thinking about Daniel in the Bible you know Daniel was just a teenager you know a Meshach and Shadrach and have been they were just teenagers they were Daniel's friends and they were living in in a day where where everything was against them amen and they were young people that could be identified you can be identified with them amen when we think of them they were showing certain characteristics about uh uh Christ they were showing certain characteristics in their lives that gave them overcoming power to to to set a standard in the day that they were living amen because they identified with the word amen when they were there they had identified that Daniel showed that he had values amen you young people you need to set and have values in your life you need to identify with with certain values that you're not going to bow down to the king of Babylon amen there's another king in the land that calls himself the king of this world but you're not to bow down to that King because you are Sons and Daughters of the Living God Amen you're not to eat their food they were trying to force Daniel to eat their food drink their drink drink their alcohol when your friends are calling you and say hey we're going to smoke marijuana they had values they stood back and they stood upon the values that had been laid upon them in their hearts and you can do the same thing you can have those same kind of values in this day and identify yourself with the word of God Amen Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they had courage and you need to have courage to stand against The Wiles of this Dimension that we're living in right now you need to have the courage to say no to the gods of this world they want you to bow down to all kinds of gods they want you to bow down to uh uh identity crisis they want you to identify with with all kinds of different identities in this life you need to identify yourself with the word of God Amen praise God that's our identity that's what gives us the power to overcome and they have the courage to trust their God in that day even when they said that you gotta bow down or you're going into a fiery furnace they said we're not bowing down because the god that we serve the god that you serve can keep you from drugs the god that you serve can keep you from identifying with the God of this world identifying with the things of this world Amen praise God they had integrity they could not find fault in Daniel because he had the Integrity of his God he believed in what he stood for they couldn't find any fault in him they looked for fault they tried to find a way to to to break him down and to get him to deny his God but he would not do it because he had Integrity amen praise God glory to God he displayed he displayed a a spirit of Excellence because there's too many people in this world today and too many young people they're they're giving up too easy they're not willing to go all the way they're not willing to to have a a life of excellence and and and be somebody that that has the Integrity that has the spiritual courage and the spiritual discipline to choose the right friends amen we need to identify ourselves with those that are in the Bible that stood for the word of God and did great things because the same God that was with Daniel Meshach Shadrach and Abednego is with you in this day and in this hour if you will stand on the word of God in the same way king of Babylon when he saw what the god that stood behind Shadrach Meshach and abednegal could do and that he could keep them in the fiery furnace God can keep you through those trials God can keep you through those circumstances God can keep you through whatever it is that you might think is overcoming you but you stand on the word of God regardless and God will meet you in that fire God will be with you God will give you the power to overcome and when the king of Babylon saw what the what the what the god of of Meshach and Shadrach and Abednego could do he told them this is the true and living God Amen and when your friends see you living for this Gospel of believing this word and believing that God has sent us a prophet in this day to identify and identify the true church God will stand behind you God will identify you praise God forevermore amen I believe we've got a great young people in this ministry amen there are young people that are identifying with the word of God praise God God bless each and every one of you continue to pray for the services we're under great expectation to receive something here tonight if you come with expectation in your heart
