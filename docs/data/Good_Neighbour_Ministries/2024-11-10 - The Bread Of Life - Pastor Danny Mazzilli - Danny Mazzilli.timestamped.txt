[29:52] you've prayed and you've believed the
[29:53] Lord I believe you'll be blessed today
[29:56] amen well it's been an interesting week
[29:59] to say the least
[30:01] amen um the past week uh the US went
[30:04] through some uh interesting
[30:08] elections and uh here it is we have the
[30:11] Trump back in the house the White House
[30:16] come the new year and you know it was it
[30:19] was interesting um uh you know back in
[30:22] 2016 I remember when uh he was he was
[30:25] running for the election and I was in
[30:27] insired at that time you know to
[30:29] minister on the last Trump at that time
[30:32] and then he ended up you know coming
[30:33] into the into the White House and four
[30:36] years um in his office and then you know
[30:40] it's interesting about uh two weeks
[30:42] while you know the last few weeks we've
[30:44] been ministering on on the church in
[30:46] Israel and and uh we've been sounding
[30:49] the trumpet and uh you know it was about
[30:51] maybe two weeks ago I I started to get
[30:54] all this inspiration to minister again
[30:57] on the last trumpet
[30:58] and it was you know it was uh and then I
[31:01] realized oh wait a minute I'm not
[31:03] ministering next
[31:04] Sunday Pastor Simon was ministering so I
[31:08] said oh it's going to be after the
[31:10] elections and so I'll just leave it
[31:12] alone and um and you know and then the
[31:15] inspiration just kind of left me but
[31:17] then all of a sudden here he is back you
[31:20] know and uh he was elected uh so I
[31:22] believe the Lord You Know listen the
[31:25] Lord is the one that deals and raises up
[31:31] individuals governments kingdoms Kings
[31:35] he's the one that places them into their
[31:38] positions and puts them on the Thrones
[31:40] amen go back into the Old Testament
[31:42] you'll see it over and over again how it
[31:45] was that the Lord did these things why
[31:49] in order to fulfill his
[31:52] prophecy so that his word could be
[31:54] fulfilled so all of these things that
[31:57] that that we've seen happening and we're
[31:59] witnessing now more than ever before we

[36:16] way amen praise God let's go to our
[36:19] scripture from St John chapter
[36:21] 6 we'll start reading from verse 25 and
[36:25] when they had found him on the other
[36:27] side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi
[36:31] when camest thou hither Jesus answered
[36:34] them and said verily verily I say unto
[36:37] you you seek me not because you saw the
[36:40] Miracles but because you did eat of the
[36:44] Loaves and were filled you see he was
[36:47] you know telling them you know like uh
[36:49] you know oh Lord you showed up and you
[36:51] know we're so happy to see you and you
[36:53] know what we we're we're hungry again
[36:57] you you know like can you feed us again
[36:59] you know um but here he says labor not
[37:02] for the meat which perisheth but for
[37:05] that meat which endureth unto
[37:09] everlasting life which the son of man
[37:12] shall give unto you for him hath God the
[37:16] Father
[37:17] sealed then said they unto him what
[37:20] shall we do that we might work the works
[37:23] of God and Jesus answered and said unto
[37:26] them this is the work of God that you
[37:29] believe on him whom he hath sent Amen in
[37:32] other words believe the word pay
[37:34] attention to the word amen we're not
[37:37] here to come in you know in a
[37:39] traditional uh sense of the of the word
[37:42] you know to come here and oh we're going
[37:43] to have the Lord's Supper so I'm going
[37:45] to go I need to go have the Lord's
[37:46] Supper I need a little bit of the wine
[37:48] you know I need some stimulation no
[37:51] we're not come under that kind of
[37:54] Revelation amen we're here because
[37:57] because we've we've recognized when what
[38:00] what he said and they said therefore
[38:02] unto him what sign showest thou then
[38:05] that we may see and believe thee what
[38:08] Dost thou work our fathers did eat Mana
[38:12] in the desert as it is written he gave
[38:15] them bread from Heaven to eat you know
[38:18] they were they were saying oh well you
[38:20] know um we we know that uh that there's
[38:23] the supernatural we know that uh you can
[38:26] do those kind of mirac Miracles you know
[38:28] we know that you can you know if you
[38:30] want to do it again Lord and you know
[38:32] take five fish and take you know uh the
[38:35] Loaves and and and multiply it you know
[38:37] and we believe in that kind of
[38:39] Supernatural but here now then Jesus
[38:42] said unto them verily
[38:44] verily I say unto you Moses gave you not
[38:48] that bread from
[38:50] Heaven because we know that from the
[38:52] scriptures that the children of Israel
[38:55] they ate the Mana but then they perished
[38:58] in the
[38:59] wilderness it was only a couple that
[39:01] actually went into the promised land
[39:04] because that Mana was only good for that
[39:06] day amen and the next day it started to
[39:10] rot and the worms would show up into it
[39:13] but this Mana that we're feeding on this
[39:15] bread that we've come to assemble
[39:17] ourselves to feed on is a bread that
[39:21] that that that super uh supersedes the
[39:25] Mana that they ate in the wilderness
[39:28] this one produces eternal life this is
[39:31] eternal life amen he says but my father
[39:36] giveth you the true
[39:38] bread from heaven for the bread of God
[39:42] is he which cometh down from heaven and
[39:46] giveth life unto the
[39:49] world then said they unto him Lord
[39:52] Evermore give us this bread and Jesus
[39:56] said unto them I am the bread you see we
[40:00] don't want to be looking to the Natural
[40:02] bread here this morning we don't want to
[40:04] be looking to the natural wine here this
[40:07] morning amen there's something that
[40:10] that's available to you this morning
[40:13] that is that goes beyond this natural
[40:15] bread and this wine we want to go beyond
[40:19] the
[40:20] tradition Jesus said do this in
[40:24] remembrance amen
[40:27] he saysi am that bread of life he that
[40:30] cometh to me shall never hunger and he
[40:32] that believeth on me shall never thirst
[40:36] God bless you you may be
[40:38] seated amen glory to God what a Time
[40:42] Saints what an hour that we're living in
[40:45] amen that we would uh you know come to
[40:48] recognize what the true bread of life is
[40:52] listen to brother brandom here he
[40:54] says in the message Paradox he say says
[40:57] Heavenly Father we thank thee this
[41:00] morning for the blood that makes us
[41:02] Brothers we thank thee for the Son of
[41:05] God who gave his life that we might be
[41:08] one with him in this great Kingdom upon
[41:11] the Earth the Kingdom of Heaven that's
[41:14] to be established we're looking for that
[41:17] glad Millennium day when our blessed
[41:20] Lord shall come and catch his waiting
[41:23] bride away the little bride tree he is
[41:26] that tree
[41:27] that was in the Garden of Eden the bread
[41:30] of life so
[41:34] is his little wife a tree the bride tree
[41:38] of the last days where everything has
[41:41] tried to bring but the great powers of
[41:45] God prunes the branches off that the
[41:48] fruit might ripen Grant Lord that we can
[41:52] be included in that give us eternal life
[41:57] life amen praise God listen this is not
[42:01] a tradition this is not just oh we're
[42:04] going to have the Lord's suffer and
[42:05] we're going to come together no we are
[42:07] feeding on the body word of Jesus Christ
[42:12] and the bride has come to realize that
[42:14] she's one with Christ that she now is a
[42:20] part of that bread of life amen she now
[42:23] comes into that kind of a communion that
[42:26] that goes beyond
[42:27] you know the kind of communion that that
[42:30] the that the the Christian world out
[42:32] there claims when they have the Lord's
[42:34] Supper when this people that have
[42:37] received a revelation on true communion
[42:40] come into the presence of the Lord they
[42:42] come to realize that they're in his
[42:45] presence they're having communion with
[42:49] him they're realizing that this is not
[42:52] just some tradition where we just take
[42:54] some bread because that's just natural
[42:57] that ain't going to do us any good but
[42:59] it's the Revelation that burns within
[43:01] our hearts to know that Jesus Christ is
[43:05] the bread of life amen and listen he
[43:08] says here in God's gifts always find
[43:10] their places in 1963 he says and Christ
[43:14] is our
[43:15] Bethlehem Christ and could prove that
[43:18] every man that's born of God is born in
[43:22] Bethlehem you know what Bethlehem means
[43:25] the the house of God's bread Jesus
[43:28] Christ was the house of God's bread amen
[43:32] Jesus Christ was the word he said I the
[43:35] bread of life that come down from heaven
[43:38] he that believeth in me he shall never
[43:42] perish if he eats this bread which is
[43:45] what the word if you look at the Book of
[43:48] John you you could read you know when
[43:50] you get a chance go back read the whole
[43:52] book of John The Book of John contains
[43:55] Revelation that you will not find in all
[43:58] the other gospels John had a way of
[44:02] receiving the word and and delivering
[44:05] the word of God so that you know and
[44:07] John's a type of the Bride so he he
[44:10] could see the word in a certain way and
[44:13] God's given us that same Revelation that
[44:16] that that John had on recognizing that
[44:19] the Word was God in the beginning was
[44:22] the word and the Word was God and the
[44:24] Word was made flesh that bread of life
[44:28] was made flesh remember bread and all
[44:32] those words they're only descriptions
[44:35] they're only words that's why we we we
[44:38] need to go behind the word we need to
[44:41] recognize what the logos of the word is
[44:43] actually saying when Jesus said I am
[44:47] that bread that comes down from heaven
[44:49] he's not talking about that beautiful
[44:51] loaf of bread that's there he's not
[44:53] talking about it in that way that when
[44:55] you partake of the bread and you and you
[44:57] go to the Lord's Supper you know that
[44:59] that you're actually you know uh
[45:01] partaking of of his actual body if you
[45:05] had a true Revelation which is what how
[45:07] we're going to you know we're going to
[45:08] just progress here we're going to look
[45:09] at the real body of Christ you'll come
[45:12] to realize that that body is a living
[45:15] body that has many individuals that are
[45:19] part of that body and I'm looking at the
[45:22] bride body this morning amen amen praise
[45:25] God and he says now every every man
[45:28] that's born of God is born in Bethlehem
[45:32] in God's house of bread cuz Christ is
[45:36] Bethlehem and that's what he was the
[45:39] bread of life and bethl means house L is
[45:45] God and elhem is elhem which means bread
[45:51] and the house of God's bread and Jesus
[45:53] Christ was the house of God's bread
[45:57] bread of eternal life and every man
[45:59] that's born into Christ you're born into
[46:03] Bethlehem God's house of bread and how
[46:07] that the leagues of these churches today
[46:10] garrisoned like the
[46:13] Philistines to keep the people away from
[46:15] it you see that's why you're not going
[46:18] to hear teachings on the Lord's Supper
[46:22] like this out in the regular Church
[46:25] denominational teachings
[46:27] you're not going to hear it in this way
[46:30] because this
[46:31] Revelation is only in the body of
[46:35] Christ it's only available to those that
[46:38] are born again into that Bethlehem into
[46:43] that house of bread into that place
[46:46] where you can feed on the
[46:48] word and that word never never grows old
[46:52] that's why you know the Mana that was in
[46:54] the behind the the the the the veil that
[46:57] was in the presence of God it never got
[47:01] stale it it it was always fresh you know
[47:05] there's there's something about fresh
[47:07] bread the smell of fresh bread is isn't
[47:10] it wonderful when you smell fresh bread
[47:13] and man you take it and it's warm it's
[47:15] it's got life in it you put some I won't
[47:18] put butter on it but you would put
[47:20] butter on there and you would eat that
[47:22] fresh bread because it's so tasty it
[47:25] smells so good well that's like the Lord
[47:28] the Lord is is good taste and see how
[47:32] good the Lord is taste and see how this
[47:35] word can transform your life and and and
[47:38] take you into places where you've never
[47:40] been before amen praise God hallelujah
[47:45] and so here now he says in in uh 1965
[47:50] spiritual food in due season he says so
[47:53] it is today friends so it is today that
[47:56] the bread of life that the children Ed
[47:59] on follows the message to
[48:03] God to sustain them during the time of
[48:07] drought I'll tell you there's a famine
[48:09] in the land for the word of God the
[48:12] people don't realize it out there they
[48:14] got to just keep regurgitating the same
[48:17] thing over and over and over again and
[48:19] they'll take studies on this and take
[48:21] studies on that but without the mind of
[48:24] God without the logos of God god without
[48:27] the Revelation the spirit of God that
[48:31] anoints the word of God all the
[48:34] scriptures that we read are just the
[48:37] same scriptures that everybody else
[48:38] reads but why is it that when we read
[48:41] the
[48:41] scripture the holy spirit opens the word
[48:46] and gives us an understanding and he
[48:47] says here what if he
[48:50] stood in our presence today what if he
[48:53] stood in our presence right now he would
[48:56] act and do just exactly like he done the
[48:59] days when he was in flesh here on the
[49:03] earth the bride is part of the
[49:07] husband the church is the same as Christ
[49:12] The Works that I do shall you do also
[49:16] and it is the word that done it he told
[49:20] us that the things that he did that we
[49:24] would do also
[49:27] amen he's talking about how the
[49:29] bridegroom Christ and the bride are one
[49:34] and they're now they're they're now the
[49:36] bread they're actually the bread of life
[49:40] in this age and in this
[49:42] dispensation people are thirsting and
[49:45] hungering for there's a famine for the
[49:47] word of God and when they meet you and
[49:51] and you start to talk on the word of God
[49:53] there's a spirit and an anointing on on
[49:57] your
[49:58] testimonies on how you testify about the
[50:01] word of God how when you read the word
[50:03] of God life comes out of the word of God
[50:06] Amen and and you and out of your belly
[50:10] shall flow rivers of Living Water
[50:13] because of your Revelation and your
[50:15] experience in the word of God and what
[50:18] Christ has done in your life amen glory
[50:20] to God hallelujah praise God let's go to
[50:23] the next scripture here we're going to
[50:24] move along in Luke
[50:28] 24 verse
[50:30] 27-32 and I want you to notice here you
[50:33] see listen here carefully Jesus was you
[50:36] know walking on the road to Emmas with
[50:40] the disciples but they didn't recognize
[50:42] that he was actually there with them but
[50:44] watch and beginning at Moses and all the
[50:47] prophets he expounded unto them all the
[50:51] scriptures and the things concerning
[50:54] himself like I said if you go from
[50:57] Genesis to Revelation and you don't see
[51:00] Jesus Christ right from Genesis all the
[51:03] way to Revelation you need to go back
[51:05] and read it over again because
[51:09] everything that we read from the Old
[51:11] Testament beginning from Genesis all the
[51:13] way to the very last scripture is about
[51:17] the revelation of Jesus Christ it's
[51:20] about Christ The Mystery of God
[51:22] revealing himself bringing himself into
[51:26] his own Plan of
[51:28] Redemption where he manifests himself in
[51:32] many different imorph positions and and
[51:36] characters and and Prophets and and all
[51:39] the way down through until he himself
[51:41] came to the Earth and he was telling
[51:43] them all about and he was giving them
[51:45] scriptures all about himself amen
[51:48] starting from Moses well where where
[51:50] does Moses start
[51:52] Genesis so he was telling them about
[51:55] himself
[51:57] starting back in the Book of
[52:01] Genesis and they drew nigh unto the
[52:04] village with they went and he made as
[52:07] though he would have gone
[52:09] further but they constrained him saying
[52:12] abide with us for it is toward evening
[52:15] and the day is far spent and he went in
[52:18] to Terry with them and it came to pass
[52:21] as he sat at meat with them he took
[52:25] bread and blessed blessed
[52:27] it and break and gave to them notice
[52:32] that Jesus Took the bread am Jesus broke
[52:36] the bread Jesus gave it to
[52:41] them if Jesus doesn't break the Word of
[52:45] Life to you personally to you as an
[52:49] individual if Jesus himself isn't isn't
[52:52] a part of your experience where God
[52:55] opens the word of God listen what
[52:56] happens here and look it and their eyes
[53:00] were opened and they knew
[53:02] him you see when Jesus comes and and
[53:05] reveals himself to you and he opens his
[53:07] word to you all of a sudden you're going
[53:10] to know him I remember when I listen you
[53:13] can go back to your own experiences but
[53:15] I I remember when all of a sudden I
[53:17] didn't I didn't know I I was reading the
[53:20] word you know people were telling me
[53:22] about the word I was watching the TV
[53:25] evangelist I was listening to people
[53:27] talk on the word nothing was penetrating
[53:30] my mind or my heart it was just words it
[53:33] was just it was just it didn't didn't
[53:36] mean nothing and that's what happens
[53:38] until you come to a place where God
[53:41] breaks the bread amen God breaks it and
[53:44] he and he hands it to you all of a
[53:45] sudden you take that bread and you eat
[53:47] it and all of a sudden you look and you
[53:49] go wait a minute here that's the Lord
[53:53] that's the Holy Spirit that's God amen
[53:57] he broke the bread he he showed me all
[53:59] about myself amen and and listen and
[54:02] their eyes were open and they knew him
[54:05] and he vanished out of their sight see
[54:07] because he had come in the form of his
[54:09] theophany this was after he had
[54:12] resurrected from the dead it goes to
[54:15] show that there's another body that if
[54:18] this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we
[54:21] have another one waiting that can still
[54:23] operate in this Dimension amen thank
[54:26] Hallelujah glory to God praise God
[54:28] you'll be able to you listen when when
[54:30] this Earthly Tabernacle dissolves we go
[54:32] to that other that other body we're
[54:34] going to be coming back to the Earth for
[54:36] 1,000 years of ruling and reigning with
[54:40] Christ and we're going to have eternal
[54:43] bodies we're going to be able to break

[1:07:47] scripture in 1 Corinthians
[1:07:50] 11 23 to 2
[1:07:56] and Jesus said for I have received of
[1:07:58] the Lord that which I delivered unto you
[1:08:02] that the Lord Jesus the same night which
[1:08:04] he was betrayed took
[1:08:08] bread and when he had given thanks he
[1:08:10] break it and said take eat this is my
[1:08:14] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:08:20] remembrance of
[1:08:22] me brother Phillip would you take the
[1:08:27] bread and give thanks

[1:09:06] this cup is the New Testament in my
[1:09:09] blood this do ye as often as you drink
[1:09:12] it in
[1:09:14] remembrance of me brother Desmond would

[1:10:01] Christ we pray
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:05] amen and
[1:10:07] so we want at this time also to examine
[1:10:11] ourselves you know back in the Old
[1:10:13] Testament the children of Israel they
[1:10:15] would they would sin and they they knew
[1:10:18] that they had sinned and they would take
[1:10:20] a lamb and they would take that lamb to
[1:10:22] the priest and they'd have to sacrifice
[1:10:24] that lamb and the priest would would
[1:10:26] would slice the throat of that lamb and
[1:10:28] the blood would pour out and the life
[1:10:31] the innocent life of that lamb would be
[1:10:35] uh in place of that sinner who deserved
[1:10:40] death just like all of us before the
[1:10:43] Lord went and made the ultimate
[1:10:47] sacrifice and so today if there's
[1:10:50] anything that we want to do is we want
[1:10:53] to examine ourselves because he's
[1:10:57] already done
[1:11:00] it we are already Sanctified
[1:11:05] Justified because like we said when he
[1:11:07] died we died when he rose we
[1:11:10] Rose but because we live in this world
[1:11:13] and because we have to overcome this
[1:11:16] flesh we make
[1:11:18] mistakes we say things we do things we
[1:11:21] walk into places where we shouldn't
[1:11:23] walk and so I'm going to ask you to take
[1:11:26] a moment right now and examine
[1:11:31] yourself and and say Lord I'm
[1:11:36] sorry examine yourself before we take

[1:21:33] amen and now I'd like to change the
[1:21:35] order of the service as we move into the
[1:21:39] foot washing let's go to the next
[1:21:41] scripture in
[1:21:43] John chap 13: 3
[1:21:48] to8 and Jesus knowing that the father
[1:21:50] had given all things unto his hands and
[1:21:54] that he was come from God and was sent
[1:21:57] and went to God he riseth from
[1:22:01] supper and laid aside his garments and
[1:22:04] took a towel and girded
[1:22:07] himself I want you to notice right after
[1:22:09] the supper he just had he just had
[1:22:11] supper with the with the disciples and
[1:22:14] now he gets up knowing that it's already
[1:22:18] a finished work you see what he said he
[1:22:21] says knowing that all things had been
[1:22:24] given already already into his
[1:22:25] hands pay attention now and GED himself
[1:22:30] after that he poured water into a basin
[1:22:33] and began to wash the disciples feet and
[1:22:36] to wipe them with towel wherewith he was
[1:22:40] girded then cometh he to to Simon Peter
[1:22:44] and Peter saith unto him Lord does thou
[1:22:46] wash my feet and Jesus answered and said
[1:22:50] unto him what I do thou knowest not now
[1:22:55] now but Thou shalt know
[1:22:58] Hereafter see Jesus knew what he was
[1:23:02] doing Jesus knew that he has uh he he's
[1:23:06] got to go to the Cross he knows now what
[1:23:09] he has to do for them that they're going
[1:23:12] to be made clean that they're going to
[1:23:13] be made whole listen what he goes on and
[1:23:16] says here Peter saith unto him Thou
[1:23:18] shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered
[1:23:21] him and said if I wash thee not thou has
[1:23:23] has no part with
[1:23:26] me you see he
[1:23:28] knew that they were a part of him amen
[1:23:32] he knew that Peter was a part of him he
[1:23:35] knew that the disciples were all those
[1:23:37] that that that God from before the
[1:23:40] foundations of the world had been given
[1:23:42] to him you are not here by accident you
[1:23:45] are Sons and Daughters of God that were
[1:23:48] in Christ before the foundations of this
[1:23:51] world and he knew it he knew knew that
[1:23:54] you would come to this place he knew
[1:23:56] that you would have to go through this
[1:23:57] Humanity he knew that you would have to
[1:23:59] face situations as a human being that's
[1:24:03] why he told Peter listen you if I don't
[1:24:06] wash you you're not going to have any
[1:24:08] part of me because he knew that now he
[1:24:11] was going to be going to Calvary and the
[1:24:13] same spirit that was upon him that was
[1:24:16] on Jesus Christ that took him to Calvary
[1:24:18] was going to be released so that a
[1:24:21] portion could come down on each and
[1:24:22] every one of us so that we could
[1:24:25] manifest the word in our day so that we
[1:24:28] could recognize that that like Jesus
[1:24:30] said you're going to do as I do listen
[1:24:34] here he goes on if I wash thee not thou
[1:24:36] H has no part go to the next frame he
[1:24:38] says Simon Peter saith unto him Lord not
[1:24:41] my feet only but also my hands and my
[1:24:44] head you know all of a sudden P Peter
[1:24:46] says oh man if you're going to wash me
[1:24:48] then wash me completely but listen to
[1:24:51] what Jesus said he says he that is
[1:24:54] washed needeth not Sav to wash his
[1:24:59] feet but is clean every wit and ye are
[1:25:03] clean but not all you see Jesus was
[1:25:06] saying you don't need to be washed from
[1:25:11] head all the way down he says just your
[1:25:14] feet because that's that's the part of
[1:25:16] you that touches this Earth but your
[1:25:19] souls your attributes who you really are
[1:25:22] you're already clean
[1:25:25] Jesus already knew that the that it was
[1:25:27] a unfinished work that he was just
[1:25:30] manifesting in a human form that which
[1:25:34] was that was was was already done from
[1:25:37] before the foundations of the world the
[1:25:40] lamb had already given his life he was a
[1:25:42] bleeding bloody lamb that had already
[1:25:44] given he knew what he had to do but he
[1:25:47] had to fulfill the scripture amen and he
[1:25:51] knew that we were already clean but
[1:25:53] because we we still in this human form
[1:25:56] brother Gabriel once in a while we go
[1:25:58] into places where we shouldn't go amen
[1:26:00] we touch the Earth and we we we you know
[1:26:03] we we we we we get dirty
[1:26:07] feet and we need to wash one
[1:26:11] another because Jesus in in washing the
[1:26:15] disciples feet was showing that that
[1:26:18] when you come to that day that you know
[1:26:20] that I am in the father and ye and me
[1:26:22] and I in you
[1:26:24] then it's going to be you washing the
[1:26:26] Saint's feet you're going to be washing
[1:26:28] one another's feet it's going to be like
[1:26:30] washing his feet the bride's feet the
[1:26:34] bride age the season that we're living
[1:26:37] in where we recognize that that that we
[1:26:40] are
[1:26:41] Justified we're not we're not you know
[1:26:44] uh eating the bread and drinking the
[1:26:46] wine so that so that we can be
[1:26:49] reusi so that we can be forgiven again
[1:26:56] there is therefore no condemnation to
[1:26:58] them that are in Christ amen we were
[1:27:01] talking about how the how Bethlehem is
[1:27:04] the house of God's bread and if in you
[1:27:06] if you're in that house then you're
[1:27:08] Justified your sins are forgiven as
[1:27:12] though you never done it in the first
[1:27:14] place but you need to be reminded of
[1:27:17] this hour and you need to recognize who
[1:27:20] you really are and by doing this and by
[1:27:23] coming together today I hope you're not
[1:27:26] just seeing a tradition but I hope
[1:27:28] you're seeing the word Christ in you
[1:27:31] Christ The Mystery of God being revealed
[1:27:34] in you Christ in you washing each
[1:27:36] other's feet feeding and edifying one
[1:27:39] another in the body of Jesus
[1:27:44] Christ
[1:27:46] Hallelujah but he says but not all
[1:27:49] because God knew that that there was
[1:27:51] going to be those that were going to be
[1:27:53] like Judas
[1:27:54] that's right that we're not going to be
[1:27:56] able to receive the word that's why he
[1:27:59] says you're all clean but not
[1:28:03] all Oh Glory to God for he knew who
[1:28:06] should betray him therefore said he ye
[1:28:09] are not all
[1:28:11] clean but the ones that were clean the
[1:28:14] ones that were attributes of God the
[1:28:15] ones that were Sons and Daughters of God
[1:28:18] they were clean before he washed their
[1:28:22] feet Hallelujah
[1:28:24] but he was showing them that you're
[1:28:26] still going to be on earth you're still
[1:28:28] going to have to overcome this Dimension
[1:28:31] you're going to still have to uh stand
[1:28:33] on the word of God you're going to have
[1:28:35] to display my word in a in a generation
[1:28:39] that that absolutely rejects Jesus
[1:28:41] Christ the word oh they'll say oh I
[1:28:43] believe Jesus Oh Hallelujah I go to the
[1:28:46] Altar and I take the body of Jesus
[1:28:48] Christ I'm eating the literal flesh of
[1:28:52] Jesus you're not eating the Flesh of
[1:28:54] Jesus if you've come into a revelation
[1:28:57] you are the body of Christ am you are
[1:29:01] the walking body of Jesus Christ in this
[1:29:03] hour you've recognized that the church
[1:29:06] like he said he came to redeem Jesus
[1:29:09] says I come not one of them is going to
[1:29:12] be lost he said my sheep hear my voice
[1:29:15] what did he mean by all of that all that
[1:29:17] the father hath given me will come the
[1:29:20] mystical body of Jesus Christ we can go
[1:29:23] on on and on and talk about how we are
[1:29:26] the family of God and each and every one
[1:29:28] of us has a part in the body of Christ
[1:29:31] amen and if you've truly come by
[1:29:33] Revelation into your position you'll
[1:29:36] know exactly what it is that I'm saying
[1:29:38] he goes on and he says here so after he
[1:29:40] had washed their feet and had taken his
[1:29:44] garments and was set down again he said
[1:29:47] unto them know ye what I have done to
[1:29:51] you he says ye call me me master and
[1:29:55] Lord and you say well he was telling
[1:29:59] them you've got a revelation of who I am
[1:30:01] you know listen there's only one master
[1:30:04] and one Lord in the Old Testament the
[1:30:07] Lord was Jehovah God and that's why he

[1:31:19] where you're going to recognize that you
[1:31:21] are the bride you are the female part of
[1:31:24] Jesus Christ manifesting him in this
[1:31:27] hour and the bride will always serve her
[1:31:31] husband she will be ready to wash his

[1:31:44] to wash his disciples feet amen and he
[1:31:49] said Master have washed your and he says
