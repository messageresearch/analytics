[0:21] praise and honor to God may God richly
[0:26] bless you and may he anoint the words of
[0:30] the Bible and of this sermon right to
[0:36] your heart
[0:36] reading from Daniel 2 verses 19 to 22 in
[0:43] there is found this verse where Daniel
[0:47] said to King Nebuchadnezzar he Jehovah
[0:52] change at the times and in Ecclesiastes
[0:57] chapter 3 verse 1 it reads to everything
[1:05] there is a season and a time for every
[1:10] purpose under heaven

[1:30] to every hammer every one that passes by
[1:35] Oh Lord may the Holy Spirit come up on
[1:40] the scene father and let thy word live
[1:44] again
[1:45] in the name of Jesus Christ we ask her
[1:49] divine blessing amen
[1:52] granted father that you'll bring that
[1:54] lawsuit last one in that lost one in
[1:59] wherever they are whoever he isshe is
[2:03] they are made a great holy spirit lord
[2:06] reach out and take ahold of some life
[2:11] some heart someone to recognize their
[2:15] day and their message and they are in
[2:18] which we are living to thee be all the
[2:20] glory and the praise in Jesus name Amen
[2:25] it's good to be here today friends and
[2:29] to our subject last week we spoke on
[2:34] part one of our changing world
[2:40] and there I stressed that right before
[2:46] our very eyes our times are changing we
[2:53] documented or we traced or followed this
[2:58] change from the time of Adam and Eve
[3:03] when they lived in the dispensation of
[3:07] innocence living innocently in the
[3:11] garden but then with the coming of the
[3:16] serpent with his seductive powers on the
[3:18] scene it changed from innocence to men
[3:24] with his conscience then Noah followed
[3:30] up and the dispensation changed from
[3:35] conscience to human government not to
[3:38] detail every change but we'll go to the
[3:43] change in the times of Jesus when Jesus
[3:48] arrives on the scene to bring about a
[3:52] change from law with its legalisms
[3:56] condemnations and judgments took grace
[4:01] the day of grace so Jesus was the one
[4:06] there changing law to grace now
[4:11] certainly friends we can also see Luther
[4:14] coming on the scene and it changed from
[4:18] the all paid mystic traditional religion
[4:24] of Rome right to the faith of our
[4:31] fathers the return of the true faith
[4:38] in just a little bug just a little
[4:42] glimmer of light came forth in the time
[4:46] of Luther and it traveled down past ro
[4:54] Wesley came to the times of the great
[4:57] Pentecostal revival when the great Holy
[5:00] Spirit of Almighty God was poured out
[5:03] upon every nation on earth under the Sun
[5:07] as it was in acts 2 there we find the
[5:11] bread when at the same time there came
[5:15] upon the scene a great messenger of that
[5:20] in the time and day of that Pentecostal
[5:25] revival never had a light shine so
[5:28] bright from the times of Jesus Christ
[5:32] himself never had a light shined upon us
[5:36] and so this messenger William Marion
[5:40] Branham changed the focus from
[5:46] denominational worship an idolatry to
[5:51] the fullness of the Word of God for the
[5:56] hour now we know that prophets are
[6:00] always signposts reading from various
[6:05] parts of the Bible when it's Ezekiel
[6:07] random we know that prophets coming on
[6:10] the scene it's a sign to the age now I
[6:15] believe this present age is in danger of
[6:19] missing their samples and if we miss
[6:26] their signpost friends we will find
[6:32] ourselves in great danger for God does
[6:36] not send a man or men in the judgment
[6:41] without first giving them a warning God
[6:45] always gives warning before judgment and
[6:49] he is giving 14
[6:52] warnings even now you are being warned
[6:57] even though that it is God Himself that
[7:01] is changing the times for certain
[7:05] prophecies have to be fulfilled there
[7:09] are certain things that must take place
[7:12] so that his word may be fulfilled in our
[7:16] day and in our times so he changes the
[7:21] times I mentioned at the end of my last
[7:27] stream livestream that we are now
[7:31] standing at the times of the ending of
[7:34] the Gentile dispensation and it seems
[7:40] that in the mind's eye we can see the
[7:43] plan writing written on the wall the
[7:48] signs around us in earth and sky in ear
[7:52] in every aspect whether it's government
[7:55] will its politics whether it's in the
[7:58] courts in the schools in the streets
[8:00] wherever the signs of the times are
[8:03] everywhere and there's a brand new
[8:06] feeling coming it's in the air can't you
[8:09] feel it friends there's a feeling that
[8:12] something is fixing to happen something
[8:16] is about to take place there's a
[8:21] assessment shift going on right while we
[8:25] aren't knows we are now here sinking and
[8:28] talking about these things
[8:30] now many years ago there was an
[8:33] earthquake in India and it's most
[8:37] reported that many days before the
[8:41] actual earthquake animals were were
[8:46] moving away from walls going on the
[8:49] trees or going into the open field and
[8:54] dogs were howling and people wondered
[8:58] why what was going on but you see what
[9:03] since neon coming danger before the
[9:08] human beings did and even God and His
[9:12] Word says the stork the animals they
[9:17] know the judgments and the coming of the
[9:20] Lord but my people knows not the
[9:23] judgments of the Lord and this we are
[9:26] seen happening in our day and in our
[9:29] times yes friends he changes the things
[9:32] and to everything there is a season and
[9:37] there is a time and when that season is
[9:40] up and a new time or age is about to
[9:46] begin then my friends we must be able to
[9:51] recognize it and be prepared to see
[9:55] those changes I believe we are now at
[10:01] the changing of another time as I've
[10:05] said it's a time for something to take
[10:07] place Jesus spoke in the words Matthew
[10:14] 24 when you see signs in the heavens
[10:20] signs in the earth perilous times upon
[10:25] us with Wars rumors of wars earthquakes
[10:32] everywhere the sea is Rory
[10:36] my friends pestilences he spoke about
[10:41] coming upon the face of the earth when
[10:44] you see those viruses those epidemics
[10:48] those pestilences coming upon the face
[10:51] of the earth know that my coming is not
[10:55] a so I announce to you the coming of the
[10:59] Lord is at hand are you prepared prepare
[11:03] to meet thy God if you have not left
[11:07] close as you possibly can draw nigh to
[11:11] him call upon his name ask for his
[11:15] forgiveness
[11:16] ask him to come into your life and if
[11:19] you claim and believe that he's in your
[11:22] life
[11:23] tell him Lord I want to walk closer and
[11:27] closer as I possibly can for your glory
[11:31] and for your honor yes sir
[11:34] Jesus spoke about this day he says when
[11:38] you see this these things it is the
[11:40] beginning of Sorrows the beginning of
[11:44] Sorrows saying in other words we are now
[11:48] living in a pre tribulation period we
[11:52] are living in this period my friends
[11:55] when the tribulation is starting to
[11:59] usher its way in gradually by increasing
[12:05] birth pains and problems and travail and
[12:09] trials coming in and while that is
[12:13] happening the rapture is fixing to take
[12:16] the bride out of here for God is not
[12:20] going to leave his people his children
[12:23] him here upon the earth when all of the
[12:27] major judgments and the major
[12:30] tribulation begins we will be taken out
[12:35] of here by what we believers know as the
[12:39] rapture of the saints of the Living God
[12:42] oh I live for that day and for that hour
[12:46] but even if I am NOT alive or you were
[12:50] not alight for that hour he promised he
[12:53] will raise the dead first and then that
[12:56] remain and are alive he'll be caught up
[13:00] into the presence of the Lord
[13:02] absent from the body present with the
[13:05] Lord
[13:06] oh what a great day what a great camp
[13:09] meeting time we will have what a great
[13:12] brush Arba time in the presence of the
[13:15] Living God when we shall meet and greet
[13:18] each other and the saints that have gone
[13:22] before in the house of the Lord however
[13:25] Jesus said it the beginning of Sorrows
[13:29] the beginning of sorrow or tribulation
[13:33] that is to come
[13:36] also known as the time of Jacob's
[13:40] trouble yes my friends we live in this
[13:46] time when it's time now for God's time
[13:51] clock is striking the hour you say what
[13:55] do you mean God's time clock God's
[13:57] timepiece Israel the nation of Israel
[14:02] it's God's timepiece if you want to know
[14:07] the time of the day you want to know the
[14:10] hour if you're asking me sir do you know
[14:14] what time it is I will answer you by
[14:17] saying look at the nation of Israel for
[14:22] something is fixing to happen with her
[14:25] and for her we my friends can look ahead
[14:29] and see that Israel is suddenly going to
[14:34] be voted into a position of power and
[14:37] influence great influence if you think
[14:41] that she has influence and power on the
[14:44] earth now watch my friends what's fixing
[14:48] to happen for Israel is now fixing to
[14:54] enter into her global power the presence
[15:01] of the anointing of God is leaving the
[15:04] Gentile Church as the Gentile church
[15:08] rots and goes into her time of
[15:12] corruption and travail my friends the
[15:16] Spirit of the Living God
[15:18] is writing the words across every door
[15:21] in Chabad written across every
[15:24] denomination the glory of the Lord is
[15:29] departed the glory of the Lord is slowly
[15:34] slipping away and as the Sun rose in the
[15:39] east and sets in the
[15:41] first my friends and then when it sets
[15:46] in the west the next morning
[15:48] it goes back east even saw the Sun s UN
[15:54] som rose in the eastern world Jesus
[16:00] Christ came in East and my friends now
[16:06] time for sunset is the sunset hour on
[16:11] upon the western world everything is
[16:15] going dark everywhere the church age
[16:19] going dark the spirit of love this young
[16:23] upon the church world cry out against
[16:27] the church oh my god take them out that
[16:31] blow the trumpet in Zion tell them
[16:34] people my people their iniquity and the
[16:37] house of Israel of our sins yes my
[16:39] friends and so the light of God which
[16:44] has shined and is still shining in a
[16:48] glimmer upon the Gentile world
[16:51] especially here in the West that spirit
[16:55] of Almighty God the anointing the light
[16:58] of God the great perfect realization
[17:01] that comes by the revelation of the Holy
[17:04] Spirit it's going right back east again
[17:08] and it's going to rest upon the Jewish
[17:11] people and anoint them and use them for
[17:15] his glory and honor no matter what your
[17:19] thoughts are about them that's the word
[17:23] of the Living God written in the spider
[17:25] that must come to pass for heavens on
[17:29] earth will pass away but my words shall
[17:32] never pass away market Israel is coming
[17:37] into power for the fun for and by the
[17:41] fulfillment of prophecy amen yes sir oh
[17:46] praise God hallelujah I'm saying my
[17:50] friends it's not that I
[17:53] naturally know anything
[17:55] but in my soul my spirit I know my
[18:01] friends from the Word of God than the
[18:04] revelation of the Holy Spirit that
[18:07] Israel my friends is first going to
[18:11] experience a time of great trouble and
[18:15] trouble upon earth it is a time of
[18:19] Jacob's trouble then what will it be
[18:23] time of Jacob's trouble Israel will be
[18:28] deceiving others just like Jacob
[18:31] deceived others trick others Israel my
[18:37] friends would be in such a place where
[18:41] she will also be betrayed by a lot of
[18:45] other nations in whom she put her trust
[18:48] in whom she trusted their loyalty and
[18:52] their friendship she's going to face a
[18:54] time of betrayal also on trickery and
[18:58] deception he will use trickery and
[19:02] deception but she will also be betrayed
[19:08] and tricked that time is right at the
[19:13] door right upon us yes sir so we see in
[19:18] order for her to come to a place for
[19:23] Israel like Jacob to really be able to
[19:29] grab ahold and hold on to her rightful
[19:33] birthright and inheritance she will use
[19:37] every trickery every deception and every
[19:41] betrayal in the book for that's hard but
[19:45] right and she'll take a hold of it and
[19:48] she what let it go but while she's doing
[19:52] that she will also be tricked and be
[19:56] betrayed for we know this world heading
[19:59] into that we are now the pre tribulation
[20:02] period and they're going into the
[20:04] Tribulation Period so subtly
[20:08] you you know you will hardly realize or
[20:11] recognize what's really taking place and
[20:14] one day you'll wake up and say oh I
[20:17] thought that we were to be warned you
[20:20] are being warned by the signs of the
[20:22] times by the servants of the lead God
[20:25] wherever they are that we are in this
[20:28] season and time is slipping away and
[20:31] time will soon blend and change into
[20:34] eternity it will all be over then but
[20:37] before that certain things in the Word
[20:40] of God must take place friends Israel
[20:44] must as I say come to her place of power
[20:47] she must come to her time of the feast
[20:51] of the trumpets she must also regardless
[20:56] of whatever obstacles are in her way she
[21:00] must read bill Solomon's Temple right
[21:04] where it is for when she does that
[21:07] there must be the sacrifices reinstated
[21:11] so the red heifer will suddenly appear
[21:14] on the scene oh praise be to Jehovah
[21:19] praise be to the Lord God Almighty may
[21:22] his name be praised and blessed
[21:25] forevermore glory to God hours upon us I
[21:29] feel it in my spirit my soul write down
[21:33] my friends that the Word of God is now
[21:36] moving the supernatural
[21:40] universe is moving things are shifting
[21:42] and taking place and God is about to
[21:46] receive his glory yes sir here we are my
[21:51] friends
[21:51] I tell you but after Israel has been
[21:56] destined after the testing welcome the
[22:02] blessing after Jacob's testing then came
[22:07] the blessing so will it be with Jacobs
[22:11] children and his generations that of
[22:14] help to God's unchanging hand
[22:17] of the Word of God friends sometimes we
[22:21] don't understand that nation may stumble
[22:27] it may even do wrong things at times it
[22:31] may do things maybe contrary to what's
[22:34] even written in the word but regardless
[22:38] of that you must look beyond and see
[22:41] they are the children of the people of
[22:43] God God will judge where and who he has
[22:48] the judge and who has the best healer
[22:51] best who has to repent
[22:53] they'll have to repent as a nation but
[22:56] never mind all of that the holy God of
[23:00] heaven is in control for he changed the
[23:03] times he changed the seasons and when
[23:06] they moral and spiritual and
[23:09] supernatural are of the universe is
[23:11] moving none should get in its way and
[23:15] try to hinder it or stop it for as the
[23:18] scripture said you got Mills of God
[23:21] grain slow my friends but if you get in
[23:25] its way it'll grind you to powder
[23:27] whether you be a person whether you be a
[23:30] power of government no matter who and
[23:32] what we are the mills of God will drain
[23:36] you the powder make way for the king
[23:38] make way for the fulfillment of the word
[23:41] make way for the Word of God to come to
[23:44] pass my friends for it will surely come
[23:47] to pass whether we are willing or not it
[23:50] will come to pass for God has spoken and
[23:54] his word cannot change yes my friends we
[23:58] see clearly that God's fig tree has
[24:02] already began to blossom in preparation
[24:06] for when he comes again he'll be able to
[24:09] go to that tree Israel being the grobotz
[24:13] fig tree and find sweet fruit for his
[24:16] coming glory that he might eat something
[24:19] that's a sweet in his in his mouth and
[24:22] the sweet must rolls of perfume in his
[24:27] nostrils
[24:28] he receives the great sacrifices in his
[24:31] wonderful presence oh praise God the
[24:35] Messiah's glory about to be made
[24:38] manifest Oh God the manifest God to his
[24:43] people declaring himself by the
[24:45] unveiling of his word in this hour
[24:48] but then they shall see him face to face
[24:51] oh my god they'll see him face to face
[24:55] we speak spiritually but they will
[24:58] literally see him for all every eye
[25:01] shall behold him and they have
[25:04] recognized him as their Messiah Oh glory
[25:08] to God SARS Ebola and now Karuna my
[25:16] friends when they this this plagues
[25:20] begin to fall and when we see the plague
[25:26] Korona crowning our lands crowning the
[25:30] people evil coming to its crowning time
[25:34] my friends I believe it's at the same
[25:38] time of darkness as it was in Egypt I
[25:44] believe it's the same time when my
[25:47] friends the angel of God comes at that
[25:52] particular time you say well why is the
[25:55] angel of God the God going to come when
[25:57] it's darkness and you've preached a few
[26:00] weeks ago how the entire light and
[26:04] troops of the Word of God is going to a
[26:07] spiritual supernatural blacoh just as it
[26:12] was in Egypt when it was darkness then
[26:17] the angel of God was set forth for those
[26:21] who had the blood upon their doorposts
[26:24] and so it was then so is it now that the
[26:30] angel of God is now going forth in a
[26:35] sealing time there is a ceiling
[26:37] anointing when the break holy s--t
[26:40] the great angels are here to seal the
[26:46] true believers in their foreign seal
[26:50] them in their foreign Florida God yes
[26:54] sir he's sealing his own he's sealing
[26:57] their minds he's protecting their minds
[27:01] against the arrows of the devil the
[27:05] suggestions the evil thoughts from the
[27:09] devil the temptations the seductions the
[27:12] charm the witchery that the devil is
[27:14] sending forth took to me guile the
[27:18] people of God these enticing and
[27:20] seducing spirits that have invaded our
[27:23] planet invaded the Church of the Living
[27:26] God in this hour until the mouths of
[27:29] many men of God have been corrupt and
[27:32] they then they can't even give a warning
[27:35] anymore
[27:36] they hardly use the word hell they'll
[27:39] hardly speak about sin repentance back
[27:42] to the word they'll hardly tell you
[27:44] repent your people get on your knees
[27:48] talk to God crane with sincerity not
[27:52] some dry eye mascara painted wipe of
[27:56] your face but a genuine repentance of
[27:59] comes from the Living God when your
[28:01] heart reaches up to him and he reaches
[28:04] out to you and you realize from that
[28:06] hour you are a changed person changed

[34:19] because that ship is sealed praise God
[34:23] from the outside to the inside or from

[34:33] believer it can be said of them they're
[34:35] in this they're floating through this
[34:38] sea of sin and they're in the sea of sin
[34:42] but the ships in is not in the ship

[34:54] power of the Holy Spirit or the same
[34:57] spirit that raised Christ from the dead
[35:00] dwell in you he shall also quicken your
[35:03] mortal bodies by the Spirit of the
[35:06] Living God that dwells in you here we
[35:09] are under the protection of the blood
[35:12] the same posts everywhere are pointing
[35:15] to a coming of the Lord and evil has
[35:18] seconds and the mocking of our God and
[35:21] of his people is now taking place but
[35:25] there's a
[35:26] changing time as I've said that change
[35:29] will be Israel coming into her power in
[35:33] this hour amen watch it now it's about
[35:37] to happen and who must be ready for it
[35:40] amen and it's coming whether whether you

[35:46] going to happen there's another changing
[35:49] time that's here upon us a new world
[35:54] order is now beginning to emerge amidst
[36:00] disappearance of covet 19 revelation 19
[36:07] this environment of pandemic is a saying
[36:14] for spiritual people of the Living God
[36:16] to recognize what is taking place for it
[36:22] is the changing of the world system the
[36:27] entire changing of this systems of the
[36:30] world is now taking place morally
[36:37] spiritually the entire cosmic
[36:42] environment of the entire world is now
[36:46] undergoing renovation restoration use
[36:51] any word who want transformation simply
[36:55] it's going through change and when God
[37:00] begins to change the time the season and
[37:03] the age he says I am God who can
[37:08] withstand who can stop her extend his
[37:11] power who can withstand the changes that
[37:15] he is making and he makes glory to his
[37:18] marvelous and wonderful names so this
[37:21] great moral and spiritual supernatural
[37:24] arc of the universe kids who feel it
[37:29] friends get to recognize it it has moved
[37:32] the pillar of fire that led the church
[37:36] of Israel pass
[37:39] picked up itself and it's starting to
[37:42] move as I said the force moving from the
[37:46] Gentiles going back to Jewish brothers
[37:49] and sisters that trust in the great
[37:51] Jehovah God amen yes sir
[37:55] Gloria's marvelous name but even wider
[37:58] than Israel itself this presence of
[38:03] Almighty God is it's just seeping out
[38:07] and permeating every aspect of the
[38:12] entire universe Oh friends it's
[38:17] everywhere if you have any super
[38:20] spiritual sense you'll recognize that
[38:25] the universe is moving we live in a
[38:29] changing world and there is a new world
[38:34] order being born and emerging and you
[38:39] know for the new world order to come
[38:43] into being or to fully appear on the
[38:49] scene the old order must go it has to
[38:56] rot and die and be put away so that the
[39:00] new world order can come to life and be
[39:05] made manifest right before us so
[39:08] therefore we are in the midst social
[39:12] change is going on political change is
[39:18] going on there's a generational change
[39:24] that's going on yes this new generation
[39:30] their way of thinking their mindset is
[39:36] totally different from the last
[39:40] generation or let me say my generation
[39:45] even my generation they have outpaced us
[39:50] and their mindset is
[39:52] different this is going straight my
[39:55] friends the one world citizens of one
[40:00] world citizens not American German
[40:06] Spanish French African whatever nation
[40:13] you're from it's moving away from that
[40:16] and it's growing my friends not to any
[40:20] specific race or any specific nation but
[40:23] it's moving on us all back to the
[40:26] original where we were at the beginning
[40:29] of the world with Adam and Eve when it
[40:32] was one race just one race and the name
[40:37] of that great race is the human race and
[40:41] thank God I'm a part of it I trust you
[40:45] are too regardless of who we are we are
[40:48] all moving into that great time yes sir
[40:52] one man sang some wonderful words one
[40:56] loved one world one word and it's also
[41:01] of course I am absolutely against one
[41:05] world Church one world
[41:09] orna oh man I'm talking about the order
[41:12] of man trying to control the world
[41:15] whenever you want to see about it but
[41:17] I'm telling you that I am making a clear
[41:19] and plain I am against that but I look
[41:23] at the word and the Word of God said
[41:25] whoever or whatever is to be done will
[41:29] be done and there will be this one world
[41:32] order one world government and one world
[41:36] church it's coming on the scene o
[41:40] friends it's even now beginning to
[41:43] display until incrementalist show its
[41:46] powers to change the entire world seem
[41:49] to change the that the politics to
[41:53] change all the thinking and thoughts of
[41:57] the people in the world it's doing that
[41:59] right now
[42:00] so just to repeat we are undergoing
[42:06] Marland spiritual change we're
[42:08] undergoing social change
[42:11] we're undergoing a generational change
[42:14] just as much as when Joshua and Caleb
[42:18] and they came to the Jordan they there
[42:22] was a new generation led by Joshua and
[42:25] Caleb that entered over into the
[42:28] Promised Land and all of that older
[42:31] generation the Bible said they died out
[42:33] and their bones bleached in the
[42:36] wilderness sad as it sounds
[42:37] that is what had to happen for the new
[42:40] age this new world order to emerge and
[42:45] to come upon the scene
[42:47] some folks are fighting and resisting
[42:50] change but it's not time for that you
[42:53] God the true believer doesn't need to
[42:56] fight and resist change but we can live
[42:59] in that change because like Daniel who
[43:04] did not fightin and rebel against
[43:07] Nebuchadnezzar but he lived proved he
[43:10] could live godly in the midst of Babylon
[43:13] whoa friends you are called out to be
[43:17] the ladies of the Living God that can
[43:22] come up from the bottom of the pond
[43:24] right through all the muck and mire and
[43:27] raise yourself to the rising of the Sun
[43:31] and Jesus said of them Oh Solomon in all
[43:35] his glory was not arrayed like one of
[43:38] these because Solomon was a fading glory
[43:41] his Solomon's glory was temporal was
[43:44] just human but that one was god-given
[43:47] glory given to that Lily all you great
[43:51] wonderful lilies of God you children of
[43:54] the Most High wherever you are hear the
[43:57] word of the Lord have a voice of the
[43:59] Holy Spirit come out from amongst them
[44:02] be not partakers of their plates and
[44:05] alter God's unchanging hand listen to
[44:08] the Shepherd's boys my sheep hear my
[44:11] voice and a stranger they will not
[44:14] follow but they will follow and come to
[44:17] their Shepherd
[44:18] voice my friends the many do not realize
[44:22] the bigger picture that a new world
[44:26] order a new world system is now being
[44:30] born one is being dismantled while the
[44:35] new has been now constructed right
[44:39] before your very eyes
[44:40] it's happening and if you're not
[44:43] watching it'll go right by you and you
[44:46] will not recognize it the old order has
[44:50] to die and pass away so you must be
[44:54] aware acknowledge these changes are here
[45:02] upon us right now
[45:05] praise the name of the Lord isn't our
[45:08] God good my friends the Scriptures tell
[45:12] us and I'm beginning to wind this up now
[45:16] that perilous times will be upon us when
[45:20] men are going to be lovers of their own
[45:23] selves trucebreakers traitors heady
[45:29] highminded lovers of pleasure more than
[45:33] lovers of God selfish the Bible tells us
[45:37] from such turn away all my friends turn
[45:40] turn turn why will you die come out from
[45:45] amongst them be not partakers of their
[45:47] plagues be not partakers of their sins

[45:57] friends and their foolishness come to
