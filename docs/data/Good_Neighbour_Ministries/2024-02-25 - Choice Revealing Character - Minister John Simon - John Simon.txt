listening for my name God bless you please be seated it's good to be here together with you gaed in his name praise the Lord it just so happens that uh uh last week instead of being here um a very close relative of mine passed away uh suddenly it was quickly so I was called quickly and had to leave so practically most of my week last week into this early part of this week was taken up with that because the father who with my myself or the first two of the family that came into the country in the early early 70s and we stayed together in one room until we were able to do better and separate and go our various ways okay so I know uh he's my first cousin actually and so he passed and then the wife and the family were in Toronto and uh somehow I haven't been in touch with them for I don't know maybe about 5 years something like that um but anyway when a mother passed they don't have anybody else you don't have any any relatives in the country except me so obviously uh when they call I just this one of those things you have to do so I had to be there for them um you know comforting strengthening in every possible way and we thank the Lord Jesus for that um I couldn't even listen to last week service actually I started and started a little bit of it and then I had to come off so I apologize uh brother brother Tim but I was into so many other things we praise God that the word of God is still in our our hearts It Never Dies it's a burning fire it's a flame that cannot be put out it's like the fire that was in the Tabernacle never can go out it's not a Strange Fire it's Holy Fire it's fire from the presence of almighty God we don't have to stoke it light it beat it up drum it down or sing it up or whatever that's part of inspiration but that's not why we are here we are are here because of the word of God making itself known to Us Praise the Lord we are here gathered together to worship Him glorify him and also to express ourselves one to the other we not only here not just to hear the word but we are here to experience him and his presence and his power this great one that lives in us and with us around us walks with us talks with us every step of the way and really um your human beings we feed natural food but spirit with spirit will meet uh if if your soul can only feed on God because you are part of him praise the Lord and like a mother feeds her child God feeds us with his word and we thank him for his word here today I'm thanking him within my heart while I'm saying that for his word and and and the Simplicity of the Holy Spirit you know find as the the the the this that the devil gets in the minds of men because the prophet was was one Prophet sent here to bring the word that the the deeper you go or appear to go as more recognition you're going to get or whatever it doesn't work that way we are Who We Are by the grace of God Amen you see and the prophet gave us the secret God hides in Simplicity what you appear to think is nothing sometimes under there is some of the greatest things so the prophet says watch be careful watch be vigilant or else it'll pass right by you and you won't even notice it see Jesus got up on on the the greatest sermon ever preached on the Mount of Olives and blessed are the pure in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God my that doesn't sound mysterious you see but that's how it comes and it appears to come right and uh and it's the spirit in you the deep that calling back to that begins to see that thing unfold right what appears simple and appears to be nothing over there in your eyes when you see it it starts to bloom and Blossom and you recognize the Roman Candlestick the prophet was talking about fireworks going on in your soul brother good to see you brother hallelujah amen he's here strong in the house of God uh and I'm thankful to see you praise the Lord you had your battles too brother Glenn I know I know you've had your battles we all having our battles cuz we we're getting up there I know you would admit it but uh but we all getting up there but be like it or not God is going to make sure you know you're going to become aware that something is going on it's different I can't uh go out the way I used to go out before it's changed truly it's changing and we thank God and we must recognize the change right the Bible gives a special blessing and there was a special tribe mentioned in the bible men whom God gives spiritual understanding to recognize the seasons and the times and how to tell the children of Israel how to avoid certain dangers of the seasons times that's going on we know we're living in a time of chaos yes we know the prophet prophesied it how we'd be living in a season of Life the Prophet tells us plainly he says your whole economies are built on the seat and lies is that right yes it's all lies everything they sell you is a lie everything they try to tell it's lies it's lies they can't speak the truth because they don't have this word they they want to but they can't you understand praise the Lord and it just moves like that in them praise the Lord hallelujah thank god well uh today uh our brother has the scripture can you put the scripture up so that we can read it today uh brother together shall we all stand praise the Lord uh my topic today is Choice revealing character Hebrews 11:23 gracious father as we are about to break the bread like Jesus did we raise our hands and hearts to heaven and give thee thanks for the word of God and as you break the bread we pray you'll multiply it amongst and upon the people that we might all receive Divine strength to give you more praise honor and Glory Ines Jesus name amen and amen by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of hisence because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for ye had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them amen praise the Lord and my a is to show you exactly what I said that the choices that we make in our lives uh reveals what character nature what character uh is in you amen and the choices that we make in our lives shapes or helps to shape our futures sir is that right God bless you please be seated first of all let's do something extemporaneous by looking at the scripture amen by faith when he was born he was HD for three months because they saw he was a proper child they were not afraid of the king's commandment they saw he was a proper child what do you mean you think a NIC looking baby no they had a revelation that he was a god-sent child a god-given child child he was not just a regular baby you know we all come as babies but they recognized that he was a proper child that he was a godsent child and so they wanted to protect him in every way and later on of course he grew up and when he grew up he grew on grew up in Pharaoh's Palace as you know the story uh with the bull rushes and Pharaoh's daughter and uh he grew up in Pharaoh's Palace he grew up with all the privileges of life he he grew up with the best education he was known to be when he was just a young man one of the wisest men of of that time right so he was when he was come to years he's come to understanding he come to maturity when he's come to years he refused to be called a Baptist because he was raised in a beautiful church he was raised with a marvelous uh preacher educated in the best universities he lacked nothing and he was even a master of that uh he was a master he became one of the top church members and leaders within the system and he was favored that in next in line or he could have become the superintendent or he could have become the the the the president or the head of everything but what the Bible tells us he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter well of course we know Pharaoh still has a lot of daughters all around uh they're now known in the Bible Daughters of the Harlot Revelation right so we understand that he came out of that and it was wonderful we all were inside of that amen yes I said we all were in that amen Okay so we were all in there enjoying the Privileges and the blessings of it the offers the goodness you know H H for myself I have offers we will send you a scholarship this University that univ we'll send you over here we'll all we'll take care of everything don't worry about it you see they see that just as much as the parents could see God in him the devil also recognize there's a gift under there and he wants to get a hold of that and to use it and that's the reason why a lot of us before we were really and truly born again or our eyes were opened or we recognized who we really are we did a lot of things and we did it with sincerity if we drink we want to drink like anybody else if we want to dance we danc amen if anything we want to do we want want to use our drugs we want to use smoke we we want to whatever we did it with everything we enjoy the parties the pleasures of sin the Bible says yeah we went out there we had a wonderful time because that's exactly the devil wants to suck you in and draw you in to his way of life his way of living just like Pharaoh wanted to do with Moses but something in Moses was already calling before he recognized who he was because gifts and callings are without repentance and so the spirit of Christ was already working in him amen are you going to let me preach here a little bit today oh my praise God praise God hallelujah yeah so here he was he refused once he recognized that something was calling to be called what some denomination name anymore it bothered him to be called a Methodist it bothered him to be called a a Church of Christ or whatever denomination he didn't care how powerful how glorious it was he didn't want anything to do with it amen and when you're a real child of God and a real seed of God even when you didn't know it God's spirit was already called and you start feeling you don't know why you feel bad about this why do I feel this way that way you feel strange to your own self but it's God's spirit calling it's the pull of the Holy Ghost amen praise God do you believe in the Holy Ghost amen praise God hallelujah yesterday I'm walking in walking by the gate by the doorway of a dollar store and I'm going to walk in there's a fellow sitting there and all of a sudden his eyes go back and start rolling in his head and he starts looking at me and shouting and I just walked away as quickly as I could amen the same same I left that place and I drove and I went somewhere else I parked to go do my business I come back in and the guy runs off of the of the sidewalk and saids look look you you you you're drunk I said what are you talking about he says I know you're drunk you you're so drunk you can't even stand up straight I I'm puzzled I'm I'm just amazed see I wasn't thinking yet about what I'm telling you now cuz I'm wonder what in the world is going on he says you can't walk a straight line and and this and that and moreover I believe you're going to hit that car he's telling me I'm going to hit that car said what are you talking about about he saids I know don't move from here and let me take your picture take the picture of the car and take a picture of of your car I said oh so this car you're telling me that I'm going to hit you're the owner he said no I'm not the owner but I still in case I said my what is wrong with you and he's turn on like that and shouting and shouting and calling the crowd you know calling the crowd to come around and see this guy here I said for what I don't understand what is going on you know he runs to it and calls the security guard the security comes up and looks at me and looks at him and you know the guy and all is puzzled well I'm just saying that to let you know there's something going on Amen the spirit is uh you said he's coming back again he is coming back again not in the way we're looking for the Rapture to come and him to come back in that way but before that coming he start coming now he's already started coming the spirit of Christ the power of God the presence of the holy spirit amen the look you you know what we're coming back to the seed comes it goes through a cycle and and uh the church and even the Believers look like they're dying like the trees outside in Winter they look like they're dying but it's going through a cycle it has to go through and then it's coming back again amen praise God now brother Brandon said I preach what Paul preached amen and that same spirit is coming back again amen the spirit of the resurrected Christ Christ Hallelujah coming again we are the real Pentecostals Believers come preachers preaching say oh brother Simon acting like a Pentecostal Lord Brother Simon's church or this church or that church the the Pentecostal yes we are the Pentecostal the real ones and the devil puts it that way so that the people are left with a true and a false and they're trying to put the false flag on on you but you don't have no false flag you're the real Pentecostal a real Pentecostal is part like Paul a real Pentecost is like Peter who said repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the Holy Ghost amen when he has come upon you amen that same Spirit of Christ come to rest upon Peter who tells the people you must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ repent and turn to God and give your heart to him amen yes sir and so uh Moses refused to be called a a nominal Christian he refused to be called some church member or some denominational amen oh praise God and he chose to uh suffer Affliction listen that's a choice yes amen because he was already next in line to be the next Pharaoh right he didn't have to do anything he just had to continue the way Road he was going and he would become a very wealthy powerful personality in the Kingdom but then he made a choice amen amen must I lie in a flowery bed of East While others fight and die on Bloody Seas he made a choice that he was going to take that road and choose to suffer Affliction with the people of God hallelujah amen many a man could have walked away look there's brother Gabriel right there I'm talking about him right here which had a a a massive company uh with thousands of square footage of space trucks going and coming over 200 and something employees I don't know if that's the exact number or for but praise God going like that millions and millions of dollars coming in and then when all at once God wants to call him to a higher uh status then God takes that company way out of his hands and he comes right back to zero right back to zero and then when the Holy Spirit could pass him through the Mill and start to recognize what God is doing then God slowly start to give him back like job is that right yes start giving them back like job praise the Lord now I'm not saying something that's imagination he seated right here and you know him he's the man that speaks his mind even while I'm preaching he'll get up and say no that's not right hopefully he doesn't oh my choosing right what I'm trying to tell you in his Society in his status that he was and is still living in now he made the choice because he recognized this is the word of the hour Jesus Christ there's only one God and his name is Jesus Christ Hallelujah he recognize baptism is not sprinkling of holy water but it is going down into the water coming up out of the water and the Holy Spirit anointing you to recognize your day and the message of your day that you are living in Hallelujah and he recognized that he could have walked off with his uh with his with his brother uh he could walk off with his brothers amen who praise God he he could have gone in this direction that direction amen praise God but he chose rather to be with the people of God here amen there's me not only brother Gabriel but there's others here don't have they didn't have to be here they appear like nobody or nothing to you but they didn't have to be here they going to be somewhere else living a high life and walking with society and the highest levels of society and everything else but God's spirit in their heart and lives they made a choice to be here in the house of God with the people of God not just because of you but I've caught a revelation I've caught an anointing of this last prophet's message I've heard the seventh Thunders blast and I heard the voice the mighty Angel has spoken amen and I recognize what he is saying praise the Lord oh praise God forever more and praise God he suffered with the people of God rather to enjoy the pleasures of sin and esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt re oh my to take the reproach for the word and counting that to be greater riches to bear the reproach for this word can we all do that today if you are not doing that do that today commit yourself like Mary did to Bear the reproach of carrying the word let's carry this message amen and not be ashamed of it we don't have to be ashamed of it we don't have to apologize to nobody it's God doing it this is not my doing your doing this church is not my church or whatever I was just a vessel you are just a we not here for nothing else but to serve the true and the Living God Amen if you got some other motive than that try out the door try out the window let's live for him like never before he's coming back again amen praise God hallelujah amen yes sir for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward he recognized the prize amen oh oh my when we look ahead and realize all the prizes that we are offered amen behold I give you the Morning Star amen praise God he tells you you wear a shining Crown he tells you clear in the word of God you come and drink of the Waters of Life freely Amen in the paradises of God hallelujah now imaginatively we we imagine a tree you imagine a river but he's telling you rivers of Revelation and truth will suddenly come out of this Bible that used to appear dead all of a sudden it come to life and rivers of Revelation flowing out of it amen Trees of Righteousness growing within your heart glory to God Amen yes sir and giving you the light of the day and for this hour praise God by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king amen Faith gives you boldness because when you are certain about something you you don't if maybe or or or or or you get stumbling around no you are sure you are certain of God you know who you are what you were raised up for and you're going out there by the grace of God hallelujah through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood amen that's what we are doing by faith we are keeping the Passover feast amen because he passed over us is that right amen he passed over your mistakes didn't he he passed over all your struggles didn't he he he give you a chance by looking away from you so you got time to repent time to pull up your socks time to correct your mistakes amen God's passed over you and all the the blames all the mistakes you made in your whole life the spirit of Christ pass right over you that you can have a chance to come before him repent and turn to God and give him your life over again amen hallelujah amen glory to God isn't it wonderful to know we serve a god like that now there are many examples in the Bible but we will only point out some of them leave it to the brothers or any other preacher that might be listening or watching to recognize it amen and when it comes to choices there are negative choices and positive is that right I don't have to explain too much of that you know that because nobody has to tell you what is negative you already made choices and you see the reaction and you know you know what to call it amen if you couldn't put a word to it when I said that word you recognize oh that was a negative choice you see so there are negative choices and Positive Choices amen which are seen in the Bible First of all look in the life of the Gen Noah's generation look at the choice they make for 120 years that that Prophet was preaching the message of his hour and when he preach the message of his hour they choose to laugh at the message they choose to laugh at the individual they choose to mock at the messenger they did not recognize God hiding in Simplicity God hiding in just a a boat builder you know with with with pieces of uh wood over here wood over there praise God I know we may appear to some people like Wooden Heads but anywhere we are here but let me tell you God knows what he's doing even if you don't know why you are here God knows why you here no generation made the wrong choice they prefer to make the choice for sex and sin womanizing partying amen the next boom box drugs drink everything else popularity pleasure have a good time wow greatness this is life my goodness that's the choice they made for a part of our lives a lot of us did the same we danced the night away and now when it's time to come to church church right you come to church in the morning but you're ready to go to a party at midnight 10:00 11: in the night or or 2:00 in the morning and stay up if it come to two or three and then if you got to stack her home or whatever you got to enjoy yourself in that party but when it comes to the house of God and the Church of God no see you haven't caught the you haven't caught the trill you haven't caught the fullness of that Revelation to bring you to that state where where it's endless you can't do without it sometimes it keep you awake because your mind keeps going on the word of Jesus Christ not because you decide I'm going to stay up and fast I'm just going to stay up no but the spirit of Christ in you with that word even when you're not thinking of it suddenly it wakes you up and your mind goes off on that Amen brother sister he's sweet he's sweet I know he's wonderful nothing sweeter than Jesus Christ who makes himself known through the word of God Amen if it's me alone here feeling like this then praise God the prophet said it leave me alone let me enjoy myself I hope and I'll say it the way the world says it I'm going to enjoy myself it's later than you think amen Esau made the wrong choice Choice all right instead of him taking the word he went and sold out his birth right he sold it out amen there he gave it away for what a mess of potage so that he he could be a foodie a foodie offic uh somebody that recognized the different cheeses oh this is a splendid wine I I my wines don't come from the ordinary place my wine came from a pirate ship that sank about 2,000 years ago and they brought up those bottles and they were better than they ever was and I bought one bottle for $20,000 one sip of this oh my see they get to that point where cheeses wines different cigarettes with different finesse and using a cigarette you you just grab a cigarette and just put in your your mouth or something like that no it's got to be properly SM I'm sorry but the oh my God there's a style with it to attract that's the devil using them to attract young people who that M their their their fantastic looking style of the cigarette in their mouth killing themselves there they are my God so but we see that is what's going on yes sir e so preferred that I better enjoy myself now because they're telling me about heaven they're telling me about hell tell me about all them things not that's tomorrow that's next week and I don't even know if it's really going to happen so I better take a hold of my life now to make as much money as I can to eat as much as I can have the best furniture the best house I'm going to enjoy myself and he sold out thinking at the last minute he could get the bo right but before before he come to it his brother already got it see what about bam and and this one is more appointed he was a preacher and and he was not just a preacher he was a god anointed preacher bam was a Pentecostal you know that he was anointed but he didn't have the revelation of the word and here bam turned around and sold out a genuine gift they think having gifts is a glorious thing to have a gift no brother Bram said no do you said do you know that Wizards and witches is a similar gift to what I have but they surrender that gift to the devil they surrender it for the devil to use it and this is surrender to God you see so being a Pentecostal and having gifts of this and gifts so that that's wonderful that's marvelous but that's not the word of yah back to the word back to the Revelation back to God himself hallelujah amen so bam did what he sold out his ability to preach and man and and deliver the word and to reveal truth and to prophesy and to warn generations to come for a big purse from a pagan King filthy LCA private jet amen thank you Jes is that right am don't get too quiet because I might think you're not agreeing with me but actually I'm pushing you away by preaching about private jets private jets having a whole set set of bodyguards around you you're a preacher and you got to have a whole set of bodyguards around you to protect you you can't go anywhere in a simple car no it's got to be a stretch limo it's got to be a bentle it's got to be something of that nature then you find you a preacher is that right I was in New York and there is one uh uh female Bishop God forbid but I have to tell you the truth but a female bishop and she invited a certain Bishop from Georgia to come and have meetings in her Tabernacle her Temple which was very large in the sense that she had was large she had about 250 people she invited this bishop and uh uh he says yes uh he said you know um how many members he said oh I only have 250 he says oh he says no I can't come he says that can't even pay for an hour of jet fuel from my from my private jet so he turned it down he couldn't come he has to go somewhere else that has thousands of people that can do that right you see this is the world we are living in and while this is going on around us we keep our eyes upon the word of God and do you think people like us will grow more and more if you're thinking that way no it gets less and less is right you're cooking the food starts out with a whole big pot and by the time it starts to Stew down it comes down to like a handful is that right I'm not telling you that's going to happen in this particular church I'm talking about the message as a whole God still is going to choose whether when he was throwing out the seeds as the Divine planter whether a handful is going to fall here or a whole basket full going to fall over there or 5,000 fall here or five over there I don't know that's up to God but God knows why he placed you here in Burlington go why God knows why he put us here and give us this facility amen God and I believe God will fill it and God is going to give you a brand new facility after a while not maybe not now not because I made plans or I talk of plans with the pastor or anybody I am the one that's talking here now not because of what I hear or think or whatever but it's what I I'm telling you what I'm seeing praise the Lord that God you're going to have to have a new facility it's going to be different praise the Lord everything is going to be changed praise God hallelujah but I want you to know that that the message as a whole you're going to find a lot of Jews who say they are Jews and are not but Liars don't recognize the word but still quoting and talking and message and everything else that those are the deceivers what's going to deceive you somebody close to you when the devil want to deceive Adam where you think he goes he he didn't go and find a a a some kind of a poisonous snake out there didn't find he didn't even come himself personally trying to talk to Adam he knew that's a waste of time but he goes to that is closest to him today it's the church so the devil wants will come to the church and try to uh take control of the mind and heart part of the church he tried to displace Adam in his position amen because he wants to influence the church amen but we keep our eyes God give us a headship Christ amen God give us a headship we stand with the headship we stand with the word of the Living God Amen praise God hallelujah amen what about the so bam took money and a lot of preachers are like that they don't know about real Walking By Faith amen oh praise God yes sir they don't know about real Walking By Faith at all uh they're walking by faith is making sure that they have the money for the trip or that the money is already provided for the trip and then they have faith that I can go it doesn't work that way faith is to step out when you don't even know what is going to happen amen it's the evidence of things Hop For You Haven't Seen Nothing you didn't feel anything you didn't have no evidence of of of what is going to happen when you go but you have to go in Jesus name you've got to go obeying the word the word tells you follow him the word your headship your husband follow that word to the very end Amen brother Bram said if he even took me into hell I'm follow him amen he has a right because that's the one Hallelujah he is the one that's leading me home praise God what about Judas did he make the right choice do you know that Judas heard every single sermon that the prophet preached the prophet Jesus at the time he heard every message the prophet preached Judas could have quoted every tell you about every elk he shot and every whatever he hunted where he fished and he he he he can tell you what clothes he wore and and oh if you could only get a piece like that woman got it would heal you and I got a piece at home I I can share that with you those kinds of things they got people looking to shrines shrines of the Prophet starting to arise Prophet used to be here so if you come here you're going to be healed the prophet used to be here so if you come over here this is going to no the prophet was representing an invisible being Supernatural person he he was representing an invisible person amen and when we come to worship that's why we different from how a church should be we we not here to worship some savior nailed on a cross amen these things are only representations that we use but the fact is we come here to worship an unseen God the the Unseen presence of God and not just to lift our hands but to experience God by him revealing himself to us through the word amen praise God hallelujah if I leave nothing else with you I want to bring you in contact with this person that you recognize the person hallelujah praise God forever more listen I can stand here and and and start to describe ice cream and chocolate ice cream mild High ice cream with gobs of warm chocolate trick cing down the sides of it just waiting for you to scoop it up but those are just descriptions I still haven't given you any ice cream you see you brother Brandon puts it this way it's the same thing I'm saying you can't uh warm yourself from a painted fire on the wall how you going to warm yourself from Luther's Revival Wesley Revival you can't warm yourself with that how you going to come to that you got to have Jehovah himself who is the present tense God who meets your needs meet our needs who is here in this day with this generation meeting the word for this hour that's what we are here for praise God Amen yes sir so Judas made a bad decision after he heard all those sermons he heard all the messages he he know all the quotes he he can out quat you matter fact he can bury you with coats and and everything else like that and still he didn't recognize who Jesus was what you mean to tell me that I can have all brother bram's sermons messages and book form and video form and voice form and every possible form and I can be hearing them day in day out sleeping waking up with them and still not recognize him no you will not recognize them because no man can come unto me unless my father draws him thank you they will know when it's time for them to know amen yes sir oh my I open and no man shuts and when I shut your eyes no man can open it no Theologian no no explanation from no wise man can open up your eyes because I hold the Bible says Book of Revelation I hold the key of David and when I shut no man can open and if I open your eyes even if you yourself Paul said even if my own heart Tred to condemn me God is greater than my heart I can't even doubt it anymore because I'm seeing it too plain it's clear it's part of the word and I see it here in the word of God hallelujah that keeps me going praise the Lord my God you're getting old you're getting tired you feel weary you haven't done nothing and yet you feel tired you start feeling weary but praise God brother that's not stopping me this outward man made Decay but the inward man on the inside is growing stronger every day it's getting richer in the word of God and recognizing what God has done and is doing amen praise God hallelujah but look at the ends of these people that were so negative a lot of us made negative choice but thank God you're in here today I would say most of all because you recognize somewhere along the line I can't explain it but I I I think I made some wrong choices is that right don't get scared I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand but we all know it I made wrong choices too praise God I'm not saying I'm making wrong choice with my wife that was a right choice but she has to tell you if she made the wrong choice but the point is here you get the point I'm making here that you they made wrong choices and then Judas went out and hang himself and but thank God the Bible gives us positive examples in the Bible and the first of these is job in job 2:9 the the Bible tells us and you know the background of job job was the richest man in his day having a big Camp a company with camels that took Goods across the desert and and and and he was paid gobs and gobs of money very wealthy very very wealthy man and then one day the Bible tells us Satan went up into heaven not because of something you done the devil always like to put it that way it's your fault this happened and that happened it's it's his fault is no the devil in the background is working these things to stir up chaos and trouble in our lives and we got to recognize it Bible says he went up into the presence of God and he said look at that job he's only rich like that because you blessing him he says he's only worshiping you because uh you know you're there protecting him he said you take off your hand and let me get a chance at him you going to see how fast he going to curse your name it's right in your Bible you got to read it job and and God says okay but don't take his life try him test him prove him but don't take his life you know some Trials come like that that you almost feel the next step is death the next step is suicide then I can't take this no more you think you can't but God knows what is in you and a devil can't go further than what God tell him yes he says I command even the sea the waves can't go further up on the shore unless I tell them right they got to go back amen it's the same in our lives so chest come and it will stretch you to your limit where you feel I'm dead I can't go on this is too much it's you mean God don't know what's happening yes he does but he's letting it happen so that you come to a point where you give up and say I can't do this more Lord I rely on you you take it over that's what he waiting for when you going to give him over and say Lord you take over amen so God uses job was rich like that and God get his children a windstorm came and kill every one of them one day they all gone and while he mourning for the children news come again his Trucking Company gone bankrupt news come again the hordes of sheep that he had Bandits and every robbers come and take it away everyone part of his wealth taken away from him and then look the devil turn around go straight to his wife now instead of the wife encouraging job and saying man look at what you go through is you know let's pray or something like that listen job 2:9 then said his wife unto him thust thou still rain your integrity do you still believe that stuff you've been talking about message do you still believe the word of God you still have faith in the midst of all these trials Dost thou retain thine Integrity Curse God and die come out of that message get away from that word move out of that stuff oh my job 13 15 you know what job's response was listen though he slay me yet will I trust him I will maintain my own ways in other words my Integrity I will maintain my own ways before him Hallelujah that's the stand the believer should take can you say Amen can you say amen I maintain my integrity I'll stand by the word until the crown I gain amen hallelujah amen I'll pass by Jacob you can deal with that I just touch a few of them what about this Moses we were touching about and we read the scripture from him what about him how he esteemed the reproach praise God I'll pass over that he's an example of making a choice amen and the choice taking him in the right place so young people even us who are old the ones let us make the right choices it's you don't blame somebody else things are happening and has happened because of former choices that we made is that right but now God is showing you that so from now on you have the ability and the opportunity to make the proper and the right choices so that God Spirit can guide you he said I will guide you with my eyes not what your eyes seeing but I will guide you with my eyes is that right I'll go before you I'll protect you I'll send my angel before you to protect you and provide your way clear the way and prepare your way for the steps of a righteous man or woman are ordained of the Lord ordained of the Lord you know God's has certain things that he has that you must do while you are here on this Earth is that right he knows what you're going to do before you do it and so he says I I can guide you into that or else you're going to stumble around trying to find what is the path where you should be in but let me guide you let me have the way praise the Lord I'm trying not to spend too much time on each one here what about Joshua Joshua was in the same church as Moses he was in the same church as as as uh uh all those what were are those other guys name um names Kora dayon Abu and the others they were all in the same group following Moses the prophet Pillar of Fire above them manifestation of the spirit of Christ amen the the rod was in his hand well he had the power to command the sea to part and for them to to walk through amen a prophet like that man you you can make a Ministry after saying I was there when the sea opened up my God and and then people walk out on dry ground and your description of that for the next years to come you can wonderful preaching is that right but that doesn't bring them under that Ministry or that spirit amen Joshua walked with all of that Joshua seen it all but you know what after a while they said you know that Prophet maybe he had some kind of trick maybe it was some magician maybe it's something that he was doing but we don't know yet so but let's follow on and maybe we will find out and they were following but from the very beginning Joshua said no that's the spirit of God Joshua Kaleb said no that's the spirit of God Moses goes up on the mountain praise prise God we know the prophets gone to glory and uh then the chaos start to ensue chaos everywhere taking place now oh my he's up there you know this and that next thing all kinds of Miracles happening of golden calves walking out of a Boiling Pot uh Miracles start to take place amen everybody wants to be the prophet everybody wants to lead this message everybody wants to use their Ministry to grab a all of a piece of the message and be a a leader over thousands and thousands and have a great name everything else like that oh my and that's going on even in the message right now amen using the very prophet's message to elevate themselves into these Realms and said let the spirit of God putting you there amen hallelujah glory to God but you know what Joshua Caleb said choose this day whom you will serve if God be God serve him if the devil is your god serve him brother Bram said if you you feel you need to be a bomb he said then I will advise you to be the best bum but if you're going to if you know you are a real Christian then be the best Christian that you can be for the glory of God hallelujah praise the name of the Living God choose this day whom you're going to serve praise God hallelujah look at Rebecca Genesis 2457 Eleazar had gone down searching for a wife for Isaac which was Abraham's son and Eleazar took a lot of gifts and jewels with him and when he found the parents and the relatives he started showering them with money showering them with gifts showering them with glittering diamonds and sparkling Sapphires and rubies because Abraham again was the richest man of his time five Kings come with the treasures and they want to give it to him he says no my God has already made me Rich I don't need even that money you giving to me he refused the money from 5K because he was already rich and let me tell you something it's not wrong for a Christian to be rich God wants you to prosper God wants you to be rich that's not my subject here this morning but I don't want the devil to twist it and make you think I'm preaching against money is that right because I'm not going to preach it on a on a Sunday and then go on a Monday trying to make it forgive me but I got to tell you the truth other word of God you know but here it is brother sister he gave out all these jewels and these gifts do you know what Rebecca did the Bible you go back to this chapter you'll find she the Bible says she took all the jewels and treasures that he gave and he she gave them to her brothers her sisters her family she didn't keep any for herself she they said but but Rebecca uh are you going to go to this man who who you never seen we never seen him have you I mean Naturally Speaking you see him in the word but but by the word comes through the El you you've seen him but but but you never see him face to face she said no I will go she made a choice she says I'm going to go I don't know what my future is going to be but that's the man I commit myself to I made a choice and she chose to go hallelujah amen praise the Lord not some silly simpering Sally that's just going to be oh my mother said this my father said that my uncle this my uncle that you your marrying your uncle your father your mother your preacher who you marrying your oh my god brother sister we need people with backbone we need people that will hold to God's unchanging hand in this day and in this hour amen man we not look into buildings we not look into property we're not looking to Prosperity we look into the Prince of Peace we look into this one that's able to take us through amen glory to God hallelujah amen and around this time the devil going to say brother you need to stop preaching now you know my physical body starting to feel a little tired I'm starting to get hungry I can almost smell my turkey there which I left on a timer um this is how the Holy Spirit used me I can't help I got to stay with this right praise the Lord I got it on a timer and I I got to get home the devil going to start to make you imagine it burning up as a crisp and I got to get out for the turkey and you're missing oh Lord have mercy help us Lord Jesus amen yes sir oh my praise God list L listen friends we don't want like Joshua said let us not choose to serve the gods that were on the other side of the flood but this day choose this God whom you will serve is that right oh my not the Gods on the other side of the Capstone but but but don't serve them Gods over there don't walk in paganism but walk in to Christianity and be a Capstone bride of Jesus Christ wil thou go she said I will go Genesis 2464 and Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw Isaac in the Fe she lighted off the camel amen for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walth in the fields to meet us amen who is is this who is this it is Jesus is that right who is it it's Jesus who is it the Eternal God made manifested in a human form yes named Jesus Christ is that right praise God and when she saw Isaac she lighted off the camel is that right I'm running I don't know about you but I'm running amen praise God because she come off the camel which could have gotten her there faster than her two feet could have taken her but she was so excited she got off that Camel and she began to run towards Isaac praise God hallelujah and I'm still running I've been running for a long time and I'm still running and I'm going to keep running for the glory of God hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah amen now uh um quickly what about Ruth Ruth made a choice Ruth had married to the son of Naomi noomi of course typing uh you know the Jews also typing the denomination and Ruth typing the Gentile bride but she was married before to a no Nom's son like many of us we were married or were members or joined certain denominations right okay and he died right just like all these seven Church ages died the song says that uh uh I won't go into that I'll be preaching on that scripture but the point is that um it came to pass that there was famine in the land of Israel famine in the land of Israel and um noomi being where they were her her husband dead her son dead she has no no no nothing else there so she said I have to go back to Israel and when she said that there was orpa which was one daughter-in-law and there was Ruth she said well girls I'm going back to Israel you can go back to your mothers your fathers your family wherever you all came from and have a good life have a wonderful time you're going to have your family support and this and that you know and Ora says okay okay I'm going to go back like a lot of members that the people that been following the message they're turning back is that right because they can't see what lies ahead what lies ahead seem like famine like barrenness like trouble like problems they can't imagine is mine and so they say I'm going to go back to my mother right they're going right back in the denomination I'm going back to my mother I I know at least they can uh provide me with charitable Aid and times when I need it I know they at least they got nursing home I know they got burial grung from when I dead I know Children's Aid Society is for me I know they got insurance company they own I know they have this they have that everything I I better go back to my mother oh my and so she turned back but Nomi said to Ruth what are you going to do she says no R Ruth 11:16 Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee don't try to influence me or beg me to turn back no I'm not leaving you I'm not leaving this message I'm not leaving this Revelation but I've received it in my heart don't even try to convince me or entreat me to turn back in any way or to return from following after thee whether thou goest out I will go that's the attitude of a real wife I said that's the attitude of a real bride of Christ amen whether you go I will go and she knew where noi was going back into Israel where there was famine where there was drought rain hadn't Fallen where there was trouble and everything else and yet she said wherever you are going I will go means she's admitting recognizing the leadership and the guidance of the holy spirit amen and where thou lodgest I will Lodge I don't care if it's in a tent like some of the homeless people uh if it's got to God forbid I'm just preaching here right now but I'm saying that this is the commitment we must have to Christ unto the word wherever he leads me I will will follow amen I'll follow him through trial through testing through Temptation oh my through my own trespasses I'll follow him regardless of what it is I'm walking with the word of the Living God for this day and for this hour amen I will go where thou lodgest I will Lodge and thy people shall be my people is that right history Legend says she was actually a priestess of the god Ammon yes right oh my and being a priestess everything for her was taken care of in other words she was like a almost a princess with with everything and she was walking away from all of that to go into what seemed or appeared to be poverty trial drought famine amen for oh my God but she says no where you go I go you the leader you you you're the one that's guiding me amen and I'm this is going to prove my faith in you and faith in the word of the Living God hallelujah where do you go I'm going amen and where you Lodge I Lodge and your people will be my people and your God my God Amen listen brother Bram and I'm quickly I'm going to follow this up and close it out but you have a little more more time okay you brother brand speaking now this is not me you had to make a choice every one of us who is going to be your wife who is going to be your husband what you're going to do you know what job you're going to take there has to be decisions choices must be made in life this may be the night that you may even be having your final call to make your choice of whom you are going to serve what you are going to do maybe your final choice is here amen oh my may you in this final time hearing this make your choice amen oh look at Ruth think about Ruth when I speak of choice think about Ruth some of these old nuggets are here I want to just hit some highlights on these nuggets Ruth was willing to forsake all her Idols is that right we're not talking about them Idols they used to put on the wall but but you start to forsake your your Idols whether you're singing Idols whether it's Jame Bronx that can do a moonwalk or whether it's Taylor twist that can do the twist or whether oh my see God is she forsook her Idols she got out of Hollywood and went into the holy Woods is that right she instead of coming and being a Hollywood star she recognized that she is a morning star from the presence of the Living God Amen yes sir she forsook her Idols she forsook all of our past life whatever it might be she forsook her people her own people she forsook her people forsake everything amen and return back with Naomi no matter what circumstances were there he was willing to go on that's the way that every man or woman that comes to Christ must first be will in regardless I never like to tell the people oh you're going to prosper you're going to be rich now and God is going to bless you you ain't going to have no sickness you're not going to have no problem I don't promise that because God doesn't promise them that I say that if you're really born in your heart I don't care how rough the road gets you'll still hold to God's unchanging hand is that right oh praise God I'm not here to preach but the next time we'll preach on God's economy how God wants some of his people to be rich so that he can they can turn around and support his kingdom of what he's doing he'll put some in a middle class he'll put some here he'll put some and he'll put some right in the bottom not he'll provide their every need but they'll be at the bottom so they can witness they can speak to people on that level because this one that's way up at the top it's hard for him to come down and meet some of those people at that level so he scatter Us in all levels of society and community that we can be able to speak to those that are uh to be riched with the God's word amen oh yes praise God oh my yes sir we must come to that place if Jesus goes with me I'll go long as he goes That's all that is necessary praise the Lord amen praise God what about Esther did you think of her that she had to make a choice she was already queen of Iran Queen of Persia pers in the Bible it's Iran is called Persia and Persia is where Babylon was that is where Nebuchadnezzar was king so it's an ancient uh community and an ancient culture that they had there praise the Lord and you know at one time Nebuchadnezzar was worshiping all kinds of Gods even wanted to was worship Danielle but when the Revelation begin to strike him and he begins to see then he says your God is God Amen and he started serving God then his son his grandson start taking the nation away from the original teaching of the word of God now listen brother Brandon speaking now Romans 8:17 to18 if you are children then ears ears of God joint ears with Christ if so be that you suffer with him that you may be also glorified together for I reckon the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us oh praise God there's Glory being revealed in us here today I believe there's Glory being revealed in every one of us that believes this word of God you can't see it but you are a shining light for the glory of God every one of us is a little bright shining star amen you shine in your corner Let Me Shine in mine continuing brother bradam let me unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to rain and the reason for this is that character is simply never made without suffering the seed that's in you is never going to be able to fully manif manest and come into its maturity and the character of Christ that is in there is not going to be able to express itself suffering the fire and the furnace of suffering and trial brings that out is not that your life is going to be spent and your entire life in suffering but every child got to uh pass through um correction with their parents is that right he says if you are my children then I have a right to correct you don't I have a right to test you to try you to prove you amen then one day you're going to come to a maturity when you don't need that no more and you're going to walk by yourself in the word hallelujah amen see character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't rain is that right because power from apart from character is satanic if you don't have the character to control the power that you revealed it will just become evil and satanic amen yes sir so but but Power with character fit to rule it's fit to rule praise God you'll find that um in the church age is I want to give you so you find a place there a sman church age praise the Lord you'll be able to find right there those are some quotes I wanted to share with you as far as this goes you can do your own search and you'll find even more and there's other examples you'll find within the Bible while the musicians are coming rejoicing and singing for the glory of God I'll go with him praise the Lord amen are the musicians coming up are they running coming praise God hallelujah if you can't come I'll come down fet you up praise God hallelujah amen brother Mike I know you still got a skip and a jump praise God show me
