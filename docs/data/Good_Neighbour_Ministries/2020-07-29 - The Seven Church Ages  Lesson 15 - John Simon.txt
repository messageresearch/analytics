TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the lord praise be to god good evening friends once again we are here in the presence of the lord and we are asking and desiring his august presence and the blessed anointing of the holy spirit of almighty god may the lord bless his word today as we read from the book of revelation chapter 1 verse 16 and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp to edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shinet in his strength god bless us god bless his precious and wonderful words now in our last teaching on the seven church ages we emphasize the fact of this seven-fold glory of the person of jesus christ now uh we were only able to touch on four brilliant facets of this great diamond of his personage today we will speak on the other three parts of this and praying that god will bless us together now as the scriptures have said in revelation 1 16 and he had in his right hand seven stars of course we are aware that the right hand of god symbolizes the right hand of power the right hand of deliverance the right hand of redemption it speaks of god's great omnipotence and in his right hand of his omnipotence and his glorious mighty power the bible graphically shows him having these seven stars in a mini universe in his right hand shining as they were in his right hand now this is no secret or mystery for in verse 20. he interprets this for us and tells us clearly and the mystery of the seven stars are the angels or messengers of the seven churches we could not mistake this for the lord himself interprets it for us not according to me not according to you not according to any man's theology but according to this word of god he says these are the seven messengers or seven angels that he sent to the seven churches and as we know seven messengers seven sent to seven successive church ages one of them sent to each age god using them the first one coming first of all for to the ephesian church age and right on down to the laodicean or last church age when time for the church ages will be over now each messenger brought his message as it was revealed to him to his particular church age and when he received that revelation that messenger was absolutely and totally loyal to the message given to him directly from the presence of god now as each uh church age began to pull away or wander away from god's word began to be seduced by the workings of satan then god as we have said before never leaves himself without a witness and so god sent a faithful messenger to that church age and usually the messenger comes towards the very ending of that church age for what he is trying to do as he comes with his message is attempting under divine direction and under sealed holy ghost orders from the presence of god is to return the people back to the word is to bring god's sheep back to the fold it's to feed them a fresh taste of the bread of life to open their appetite not for any kind of false falsities or or things that are fake but give them a real taste of the true bread of life and draw them back to the original word of god now of course these messengers coming on the scene each one had to face some form of opposition in his day for jesus had already prophesied i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it which is to say he anticipated and prophesied opposition to the true church of the living god but thanks be to god he says that gates of hell shall not prevail they're assured of are assured of the presence of god with them to fulfill his word now this is where i would say where did they get their strength from their strength come from the lord just as much as our strength comes from the lord we look to the hills from whence cometh our help not the mount natural mountains but the hills of god amen we are strength cometh from the lord the creator of heaven and of earth so their strength coming from the lord they were fearless they were safe in his care and in his arms and nothing could pluck them out of his mighty hand nothing my friends could separate them from the love of the living god whether it be sickness while in the pathway and of duty and of service sickness could not separate them from the love of god the problems that paul had with his eyes could not separate him from the love of god peril jail time nakedness one coat famine these find the easy way the easy so-called successful ministry these men wandered in sheepskins goat skins they wandered in caves in the wilderness in the deserts in the mountains and would swoop down like the eagles of god upon the population of civilization and preach thus saith the lord god and after their message returned back to the deserts so that their minds were not framed shaped or influenced by the various ideas and propositions of man but they stood firmly upon the pure word of god with change at not think of my it my friends they were so yielded to him and kept by his divine omnipotence they were not concerned and worried too much about persecution that came their way they were not worried by physical pain and by mental duration of men because in this they found the cause for glorying in the lord hallelujah oh my friends crowler glory to god i bear in my body paul said the marks of jesus christ they were like the stripes of a sergeant or a general recognizing that these were the marks of his general ship and his position in the in the church of god in the plan and economy of god he recognized his position and born with pride those marks that others will call marks of shame but to him they were marks of the glory of god upon his life as gods used him and they found themselves feeling worthy to suffer for him and for that glorious name jesus i say it again for that marvelous name jesus for that wonderful name jesus for there is no other name given under heaven whereby we must be saved but the name of jesus christ in whose name we baptize and are baptized into the holy spirit and in water uh in obedience to the word of god hallelujah amen my friends they were so thankful as each of us should be thankful that we were chosen selected by god called by the lord god to serve him as honored vessels to bring glory and honor to his name and in that state of thankfulness they were willing to burn out their life with zeal and become shining glorious lights carrying the torch of life their word of god which lightens the pathway of any man or woman that seeks to know the lord god hallelujah and burning with the light of his divine presence within their life oh praise god they reflected the personality they reflected the very virtues of jesus christ emanated and flowed out from their lives like a mighty streams of light rainbow-colored powers of god flowing through them to bless the multitudes to whom they were sent oh may god bless us individually in this fashion that we may be those who are emanating the uh influence of another person oh this supernatural being the great almighty god choosing a humble vessel or humble vessels with in which to show himself god hiding in simplicity revealing and reflecting his personality right through those messengers as he wants to do through your life here today if you are willing to surrender to him and walk in obedience and of his word and in thankfulness for his life in you his love his patience his meekness his temperance gentleness his faithfulness godliness within our lives to reflect the virtues of god out of our lives no wonder we love to sing the old song to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i long to be like him all true lies journey from earth to glory i only ask to be like him may this be our desires here today to be like jesus in all our heart and in all our life lives and because they so surrendered uh themselves and walked in obedience to the word of god god backed them up oh may the holy spirit back up our words back up our lies back up everything we do and say oh praise god hallelujah i want you to just think on the word back up amen right there i will not expand on it but think of god backing you up and what it means to be backed up by god god standing beside before and behind you makes you fearless makes you bold with the gospel of jesus christ knowing that like a great mighty eagle on the mountain top while her young ones are feeding down in the valley but whatever they were feeding on if any wild beasts or beasts of the wild would seek to come to worry them or make them fearful or to pounce upon them with her eagle eyes she's looking upon them and she'll swoop down with those mighty wings to defend them and to lift them up where they belong oh thanks be to god what a comfort to know that his eye is on the sparrow and he watches over me oh my friends no matter what you may be going through no matter what may come in your life i want you to have this blessed assurance that there is an eye watching over you with tender love and care god will back up his own thanks be to god oh think of it god backed them up with signs and wonders god backed them up with miracles god backed them up with his divine presence with them they were accused of being fanatics and any true believer that honestly truly follows the word of god they will want to call you also a fanatic but my friends realize this that you are being numbered with that glorious number of those who have gone before they were called and announced by the organized religions of that day the religions of that day sought to destroy them denounce them in every possible way they were mocked they were scuffed at most of them fishermen shepherds men that might not be punished men that may not have uh extreme education or or any education could not properly read and write their their names there were some that were kings some that were great intellectuals and there were others that were just regular people from the street corners of what god uses whomsoever he wills and anoints them with the holy spirit and uses them for his glory and for his honor but the main thing about it they kept to the word of god true to the word they held to god's unchanging hand and in response god held them in his hands oh many say i've got the holy ghost but i think it's a greater and more wonderful thing to be know that the holy ghost has a hold of you and that you are kept by the power of god through faith in his word hallelujah amen it's not too hard to keep holding on to some creed or to keep true to a feed a creed because it's easy when the devil is back of you giving you of his wealth giving you of his fame giving you of his name he did this with eve appealed to the pride of life a appeal to all our senses like that and uh decedent seduced her and surely the devil will back up his man the devil will back up his woman the devil will back up his people and god backs up his own with his divine presence amen hallelujah oh my friends if we are to go back to the word then we must by faith return back to the original pentecost even in this message today the word pentecost is uttered like if it's a a curse or if it's some evil thing but uh the prophet of god was not speaking of original pentecost he's speaking of modern day pentecost that's here among us but we must go back to the pattern the world back to the blueprint and then by faith we'll see the presence of the hand of god working in our ministries in our hearts and within our lives now friends as we look into the word of god we realize clearly here amen that these men were faithful only to god's word never mind if they were sawn asunder burnt at the stake never mind if they were persecuted tortured by inquisitions driven from pillar to post hiding in caves hiding in homes running from place to place but yet they stayed true to god's word i wept my friends when i stood at their forum at rome in rome and watched the places where our beloved brethren sang hymns and walked to their death to be eaten and torn apart by lions but they held to god's unchanging hand wall to god's unchanging hand no matter what happens around you society may change politics may change the world may change but our god he changeth not and his word stands true forever and forever glory to god hallelujah the miracle is how did the little flock of god survive but she only survived because god never leaves himself without a witness and god keeps a a seed a seed for a new harvest praise god so the devil could not eradicate the devil could not come destroy the church of god for he already prophesied amen that that it shall not prevail the gates of hell shall not prevail against the church what comforting knowledge to know that these seven messengers were kept by the hand of god it is also true for every believer that we are also in his right hand and kept by him and we can draw from his life from his presence for we realize that back there that uh a candle stand my friend is one that drew its life for uh from the oil that was in it and now we draw our lives from him we draw our lines from the true vine for without him we can do nothing oh how comforting and strengthening that is to know glory to god that god gives us his love his power power and the benefits of his backing and of his life behind us and thank god each messenger to each age is an example sent forth to that age for he is there and as an a sample an example and as a sample of what the rest of the harvest will be like later on when the entire bright church little flock ripens he gives us an example of what the individual believer and the church will look like act like and function on what fashion she will function not that every believer will come up to the level of that messenger but each one will carry a portion of something that was in the life of that believer that a messenger praise god for god used him as a wave shift a sample and as a an example may you realize what i'm saying here today and ask god show me a part of that within my walk within my life lord that i may see it as i have seen you not back in the bible i've read about that but i've seen you displayed in the life of the messenger of this seventh church age lord and i seen your example jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and i want a part of that oh may god hear your prayer and answer and bless you in every single way now that is the seven stars in his right hand now let's deal with another part of his personality of the two-edged sword the bible tells us and and out of his mouth with a two-edged sword of course we know that speaks of hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and sharper than any edge it sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and the joints and marrow and is a deserter of the thoughts and intents of the heart out of his mouth with the sharp wedges sword which is the word of god you will find that again in revelation 19 verses 11 to 16 in which the heavens opened the white horse writer came down to judge and to make war and the bible tells us that his name is called the word of god and the armies of heaven followed him now john 1 4 8 when uh nathaniel came in the presence of jesus jesus told him before you were called i saw you before philip called you while you were sitting under that fig tree i saw thee that was the hebrews 4 12 the word of god quick sharp a discern though amen the word of god can discern and recognize you and not only your thoughts but your motivations your intentions god shows it amen hallelujah and think about it that same word will judge the nations and judge the entire world not only by their outward action of ungodliness unrighteousness on cleanliness carnality or any such a thing god does not judge by appearance but he discerns by his word and knows the motives the intentions of what the individual is doing far beyond the knowledge and wisdom of mortal man by this we know the world will not be judged by the doctrines of any particular church but the world will be judged by the word of god which is a discerner of the hearts and motives and thoughts as i have said if that be the case which it is the case then we know when we come to the end that all the mysteries of human history will all be unveiled and be made clear before us then we will tell us this happened because of this because of this because of this i allowed this so that this could happen so this could be fulfilled and that could happen we will understand then shall we know as we are known when we come to the end of life's way praise god thank god that he is he has revealed the secrets of the hearts of men and women in this age in which we are living the prophet is gone but by the opening of the word he is still revealing the hearts of men and the women and their reaction to his spoken word he will judge you exactly by that thank god the word of god is full of power and the same spirit that was in jesus the word of god is again present in the bright church of this last age working through it and we find as the people head to judgment as they head towards the end many are rejecting him in this day and in this hour crucifying him again as hebrews 6 6 says if they shall fall away it's so it's so dynamic how the word of god its economy and its poor tents are so remarkable listen hebrews 6 6 66 and you'll find the number six the number of men number of the antichrist all of that wrapped up in this verse if they shall fall away to renew them them again onto repentance seeing they crucify themselves the son of god afresh and put him to open shame that speaking of a lot of message people a lot of word people that once believed and have fallen away this is not john simon saying this is the word of god saying oh praise god read it for yourselves and hear what the word of god says now paul said that the word came not only in power but it also came with a voice it came speaking and paul preached it by voice and demonstrated it by the blessed holy spirit and when the word is preached on the divine unwinding it's like the cutting of a flaming sword it's like the piercings of a surgical knife and it cuts out the diseases of the body it cuts out the diseases of the conscience and of the mind it sets the captives free and everywhere the believers go they preach this word praise god the word that the apostles preach that paul preached that the doctrines that they taught and insists according to the promise that we serve the lord that changeth not one god one lord one baptism one name one true church of the living god yes the family may be scattered here and there in various denominations but lord we love them there they know one another by the presence of his spirit in each one's heart and they know it for the deep calls to the deep and the deep response for they know that they are of light precious faith and revelation living in the presence of the king praise god hallelujah whoa what a day of the word of god in action the word of god word of god in action another book of acts being written another book of acts being displayed by the word and presence of the living god and the word of god has never failed throughout all ages once it's anointed in the mouths of true believers that are sent from the presence of almighty god to bear his name without any shame and to carry out his word and his directives amen hallelujah and thanks be the god that as they as a the path of the justice as a shiny light that grows brighter and brighter onto this wonderful day so is it that the presence the understanding the revelation the sharp discernment and piercings of the conscience by the word of god hallelujah is growing stronger and stronger every single day oh praise god the little slug i know she's in a little minority but hold on hold on things are gonna change for one day my friends i tell you he will fill your heart and fill your mouth with his divine presence and god will bring you into his kingdom finally but right now it's manifesting time it's manifesting time and their fruits are on the vine praise god hallelujah and now lastly and his face was like the sun and his countenance was as the sun that shineth in his strength and matthew chapter 17 verses 1 to 13 we have the uh the recounting of the uh transfiguration and there we see it he is referring to himself he is speaking in the last book of the bible the book of revelation and referring back to himself that they may recognize who he is speaking of that he is the same one whose face was shining in his strength shining through moses i am that i am speaking through the prophet moses and on the mount of transgression the same one speaking and anointing jesus christ transfigured before them with blinding shining light of god upon him they and whenever a believer gets to that place when the holy spirit is transfigured within them the word of god that's upon the page of the bible that we walk with every day one day becomes transfigured before you you can see nothing else but jesus christ from genesis the revelation they saw no man but jesus only a true believer will see jesus only for the entire bible is christ being revealed in his own word with the great cored red cord bloody uh blood stream of blood running from genesis to revelation the story of redemption and of the redeeming power of the very hand of god hallelujah amen yes sir and so we see the great order of his coming of how that he will come back again in his second coming shining in his strength but for as he comes in the rapture for his bride then he comes again to israel he comes with his bride he armies of heaven following him to defend israel at that particular time now we recognize that israel is already a nation israel has been reborn naturally since 1948 her natural rebirth started from that time and she is now established with armies navy's postal system a glorious beautiful flag and everything else that pertains and speaks of nationhood the scripture tells us uh shall the nation be born all at once isaiah 66 8 so we see she is born naturally but she is yet to be born spiritually when all the things of the old testament the signs the symbols the types the substitutions and shadows will be fulfilled and she will experience a national revival and rebirth in the presence of god right now the fig tree is putting forth her buds she is waiting for the arrival waiting with great expectation for the coming of her messiah and they are expecting him may god help their expectations to be fulfilled so she will be reborn in the light in her light understanding of him on the word and in her life individually and national life she will be be reborn amen because he himself will be revealed to her and praise god hallelujah oh what a marvelous season of time in which we are living in glory to god so here he is the sun shining in his strength shining in the middle of the seven golden candlesticks they are candlesticks but he is the sun think of it candlesticks will burn out after a while after they've served their purpose after they have shined their light they will burn out and pass away but the sun will continue to shine in the strength remember the sun that we are seeing today it's the same sun that shone upon adam and eve in the garden it is the same sun that is shining upon us today of course that is a symbol of the word of god shining upon them shining so bright that same word of god unchanging shines upon us whether it be cloudy thundering lightning stormy day but it's the same son of god that will return after all the darkness and the fallen have passed away the light of god will shine again and is shining again rising and glory and growing its divine strength glory to god and as we have already stated god will speak again and his voice will be to the sinner a death sentence but to the true believer it's deliverance it's rapture its freedom to go back into the presence of god for its comfort its love its mercy its grace walking with him thank god believers never give up never give up to your sorrows never give up to your trials or tribulations for the gates of hell shall not prevail against the church and once again he says to us fear not i am he which was which is and which is to come i am almighty i am the almighty beside me there is none else there is no two three four there is none else not through three four gods but i am the only one and beside me there is no other i am alpha i am omega i am all of it i am the all in all i am father son and holy ghost i am the mighty god the same yesterday today and forever thank god to me he's the fairest of ten thousands he is my friends the lover of my soul praise god i want to tell you friends morning is coming the night is soon to be over and the morning is coming the son of righteous the son of righteousness is soon to break forth upon us and to rise up with healing in his wings and may we be faithful unto death and we shall receive a crown of life that fadeth not away god bless you god bless you god rest and remain with you and take the name of jesus with you [Music] amen [Music] you
