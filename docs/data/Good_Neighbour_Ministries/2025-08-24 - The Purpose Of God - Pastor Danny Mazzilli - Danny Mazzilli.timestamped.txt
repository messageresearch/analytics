[31:37] Amen.
[31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[31:43] God bless you, saints. Welcome into the
[31:46] house of the Lord this morning. It's
[31:48] good to see each and every one of you.
[31:50] We certainly appreciate
[31:53] having had the time. You may be seated
[31:55] for a moment. God bless you, saints.
[31:57] Thank you, musicians.
[32:00] Praise God.
[32:02] We certainly appreciated our time of
[32:06] rest.
[32:08] We want to thank God for his goodness.
[32:11] Amen. For allowing us this time. I'm
[32:14] just plugging in here because the
[32:16] charger.
[32:20] Just need the charger here.
[32:27] Praise God.
[32:29] Still not showing.
[32:33] Amen. Praise God. Well, we'll leave it.
[32:35] I'm sure we'll be fine.
[32:38] So, how many likes the new wall?
[32:46] &gt;&gt; We want to thank God for uh for having
[32:49] it done so quickly.
[32:51] Um, brother Alvin uh was able to bring
[32:54] his brother-in-law, Das, and one of his
[32:58] technicians, Nazil, to come and um get
[33:02] this wall done in two miraculous days.
[33:06] Amen. Two days. They put it all
[33:08] together. And um and then we want to
[33:11] thank God for um for the uh East Porters
[33:16] AV uh company here in Burlington. they
[33:19] were able to uh install our new
[33:21] projection system. As you can see, it is
[33:25] pretty much like a 4K quality. Okay. And
[33:28] understand that you know what it is,
[33:30] whatever we're projecting, the quality
[33:33] of, you know, the imaging that we're
[33:35] projecting,
[33:36] that's what the projector will project.
[33:39] So, you know, if we're still using some
[33:41] older technology in any way, shape, or
[33:44] form, then it's going to reflect, you
[33:46] know, in the way that it actually shows.
[33:48] But you can see, you know, even seated
[33:50] right at the very back that it is very
[33:53] clear and um much clearer. You can read
[33:56] everything much clearer. And I trust
[33:58] that um as we move forward, it'll be
[34:02] tweaked and and enhanced even more and
[34:04] you know allow us to uh uh you know
[34:07] improve. Everything is in a in a um
[34:11] transition.
[34:13] The sanctuary is still going to, you
[34:16] know, get some new lighting, some, you
[34:19] know, we're gonna have a cross going
[34:20] over here. Uh, you know, there's going
[34:22] to be more um that's going to just
[34:24] create the atmosphere that we want in
[34:27] the um in the actual physical um
[34:30] sanctuary. We know that the atmosphere
[34:32] of the Holy Ghost is uh what we come to
[34:36] really uh feed upon and to uh add to
[34:40] because we're each and every one licks a
[34:43] fire that have an anointing and a and an
[34:47] expectation and a purpose that's built
[34:50] and designed into our lives to come and
[34:52] worship the Lord. Amen.
[34:54] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so we certainly um look
[34:57] forward to this just as the transition
[35:02] uh comes along and matures, we continue
[35:05] to grow and mature into what God wants
[35:08] to do in each and every one of our
[35:10] lives. Amen.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Praise God. And so um just a couple of
[35:15] quick announcements. You can go to the
[35:17] next slide. um GN Youth Ministry uh
[35:22] youth camp Friday, August the 29th.
[35:26] That's next weekend. How many's aware of
[35:28] that?
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Special services. Amen. We have a lot of
[35:32] people that are going to be joining us.
[35:34] Okay. I've been hearing from ministers
[35:35] and and uh so there's there's going to
[35:39] be um there's going to be uh uh a pull.
[35:42] I believe that the Lord is already
[35:44] pulling on the hearts of the people. You
[35:46] know, I reached out to one minister that
[35:48] I, you know, thought, "Oh, I got to
[35:50] reach out to him yesterday." And I I
[35:51] reached out. He said, "Oh, brother, I've
[35:53] got plans. We're going to be there. We
[35:55] we we heard about it weeks ago." I said,
[35:57] "Praise God. Wonderful." And so, I'm
[36:01] just I'm very grateful that um you know,
[36:05] for it's got to be 27 or 28 years. I I
[36:08] keep forgetting, you know, how many
[36:10] years in a row that we've been running
[36:12] this um this youth ministry. But um you
[36:16] know every year the Lord has always been
[36:19] good to us
[36:21] &gt;&gt; and um you you can see that it's not
[36:23] something that yeah we do our part and
[36:26] God wants us to step out and throw up
[36:29] the rock and and get things in motion
[36:31] and invite the minister and you know be
[36:34] led and be in prayer about it and
[36:36] everything else. But then it still takes
[36:38] him to come and cap it off and and do a
[36:42] a a great work and set captives free and
[36:46] liberate our young people and and uh you
[36:49] know and and you got to understand that
[36:51] that this has been evolving over the
[36:53] years. This has been evolving in in the
[36:56] level of maturity um and the season and
[37:00] what it is that God is wanting to do in
[37:02] our young people. Amen. And so, you
[37:05] know, every year we always have a theme.
[37:07] And, you know, this week it started to
[37:09] come upon me. And the and the thing that
[37:10] the Lord brought to my heart was
[37:12] preserving the word. And how is it that
[37:15] we're going to preserve the word? It
[37:18] needs to be brought and taught to the
[37:21] young people. It needs to be preached to
[37:23] the young people. the same word, not a
[37:27] different word, but a word that that is
[37:29] the that that is the same yesterday,
[37:31] today, and forever, but in season to
[37:35] meet the needs of the current uh sons
[37:39] and daughters of God that are that, you
[37:41] know, attributes of God that are locked
[37:43] up in young bodies that need to be
[37:45] awakened to their true purpose and
[37:48] understanding. So, so we're looking this
[37:51] week and even this sermon today, you
[37:53] know, they they were on my mind. They
[37:55] were in my heart, the young people. And
[37:58] and um you know, uh I'm trusting that
[38:01] this is going to be like a like a you
[38:03] know, uh um
[38:06] you know, like you know, the the the
[38:07] jumping board to starting things, you
[38:10] know, like you dive into it and uh you
[38:14] know, you got to start somewhere. And I
[38:15] trust that this service today somehow
[38:17] will speak to the hearts of our young
[38:19] people, those that are present and those
[38:22] that are online and and uh you know
[38:26] there's no old people when in the Lord.
[38:28] You know that, right?
[38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. So don't be thinking, you know,
[38:31] when I say young people, I'm discounting
[38:33] you that have been you know that you're
[38:35] in your 50s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s,
[38:39] whatever. The word is still the same
[38:41] word
[38:42] &gt;&gt; and it's doing the same thing. It's
[38:44] calling sons and daughters of God into
[38:47] their purpose, into their placing in the
[38:50] word of God. Amen. That's what we're
[38:52] going to be looking at today as we as we
[38:53] we look into the word of God. Amen. And
[38:56] so, we're excited about what the Lord is
[38:59] going to do for our young people. We're
[39:01] looking forward to it. I'm asking you to
[39:03] pray, fast, believe for these meetings
[39:07] this weekend that the Lord will will do
[39:10] a mighty work and and show that truly
[39:13] he's interested in preserving his word
[39:15] and bringing it to life even into the
[39:18] youngest that are amongst us. Amen.
[39:21] Praise God. Because he's God. He can do
[39:23] that. Amen. Praise the Lord. Next slide.
[39:27] I want to let you know that this
[39:28] Wednesday's service is going to be
[39:30] cancelled in preparation for these
[39:32] meetings so that you know people can
[39:34] focus um direct their thoughts, their
[39:37] their positions because every single one
[39:40] of us that are members of Good Neighbor
[39:43] Ministries are on call for this weekend
[39:47] to stand in their post of duty and in
[39:51] their voluntary post of duty. Wherever
[39:53] the Lord has shown you to go and take
[39:56] your position in order to to fulfill
[39:59] God's purpose and desire for these
[40:01] meetings this weekend, I'm trusting that
[40:04] every single one of you are ready and
[40:07] willing and allowing. And if you do
[40:09] that, you will see God move in
[40:11] miraculous ways in your life this week
[40:14] and into the weekend. I promise you. All
[40:17] you need to do get into the channel
[40:19] where God wants you to be. Watch out.
[40:21] You'll see things have to move.
[40:24] Everything has to come into position so
[40:26] that you can fulfill your purpose.
[40:29] Praise God. That's what we're that's the
[40:32] that's how we believe God. We're not
[40:34] just having an event. We're not just
[40:37] throwing together meetings. We're not
[40:38] just having an annual uh you know
[40:41] special meetings for our young people.
[40:43] We are we are under the inspiration of
[40:46] the word of God for this hour to fulfill
[40:49] God's plan and purpose in bringing his
[40:52] word into manifestation in a world right
[40:56] now where many young people have no
[40:59] direction.
[41:00] No. Uh under great depression under
[41:03] under total uh mis misleading uh
[41:07] teachings and and uh and you know uh
[41:11] organizations that are leading them
[41:13] completely away from their true nature,
[41:16] their true purpose which is only found
[41:20] in Jesus Christ.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we want to we want this to be a
[41:25] lighthouse this weekend. We want it to
[41:27] to to stir the hearts of the people. We
[41:30] want to see young people being stirred
[41:32] by the word of God. Not going after the
[41:35] gifts, not going after the emotions, but
[41:37] going after the giver himself,
[41:39] &gt;&gt; coming into his presence with
[41:41] expectation that he can discern your
[41:43] needs no matter what condition. Amen.
[41:46] Praise God. And so we look forward to
[41:49] that. How many enjoyed the services with
[41:52] uh brother Simon uh a week ago Sunday?
[41:56] He brought a beautiful message on
[41:58] standing on the rock. We know that that
[42:01] rock is something that if we're not
[42:02] standing on that rock in this hour where
[42:04] the world is completely falling apart.
[42:07] We're going to be tossed to and fro.
[42:09] We're not going to know what's up,
[42:10] what's down. We're not going to know who
[42:12] we are. But thank God for the rock of
[42:15] revelation that he's placed within this
[42:18] body and within our hearts to serve him
[42:20] with all that we have within us. Amen.
[42:23] So I I really appreciated that message
[42:26] and uh I really appreciated brother
[42:28] Tim's service um message last Sunday
[42:32] um you know that the seventh seal sets
[42:35] you free and uh you know I've always
[42:38] enjoyed brother Tim's personal
[42:40] testimony. It's always been a blessing.
[42:43] I remember, you know, back in the late
[42:45] 90s, him and I went on a on a missionary
[42:48] trip. It was our first missionary trip,
[42:49] and I was I was ministering at the time.
[42:52] Brother Tim was not actually uh called
[42:54] to to the ministry as of yet, but he,
[42:57] you know, he was with me and and I was
[43:00] ministering the word, but every service
[43:02] and we did we we went to like I think
[43:04] seven or eight different places and we
[43:06] ministered almost seven or eight or nine
[43:09] times, something like that. It was a lot
[43:11] of services and before every service I
[43:14] would have brother Tim come up and give
[43:16] his testimony. And let me tell you,
[43:19] every service I wept hearing the
[43:23] testimony that was coming forth because
[43:25] I knew the reality of God and what he
[43:28] had done in him. I knew that that's the
[43:30] same God that I know. And and and and it
[43:34] was always a tremendous blessing. And
[43:36] here now we see him, you know, maturing
[43:39] and coming into his into his maturity in
[43:43] the word of God and God dealing. Listen,
[43:45] that that work that he started way back
[43:48] then when when he said to him, uh,
[43:51] you'll not find me here. Well, that that
[43:54] that's still progressing in his life and
[43:57] in your life and in my life.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; Okay? Because there's places that we go
[44:02] sometimes in life, you know, along, you
[44:04] know, the the journey that we have and
[44:06] the walk that God has placed. It doesn't
[44:08] matter if you're here for you're you're
[44:10] serving the Lord and in this message 10,
[44:12] 20, 30 years, it's irrelevant.
[44:15] You will find that there are areas that
[44:18] you will not find God because of your
[44:21] own ideas, your own interpretation, your
[44:24] own, you know, thoughts of how things
[44:26] are supposed to work out and how things
[44:28] are supposed to be. And yet God, because
[44:31] he's placed that portion of himself in
[44:35] you, that experience continues
[44:39] &gt;&gt; and it evolves
[44:41] &gt;&gt; and it brings us to times like this in
[44:43] our lives. And I believe that, you know,
[44:45] Tim brought out, you know, a beautiful
[44:48] thought and and and and process by which
[44:52] God is delivering his people and
[44:55] bringing them into the liberty of the
[44:58] Holy Spirit and especially under the
[45:00] opening of the word because that is what
[45:04] truly sets us into our rightful position
[45:07] as sons and daughters of God and free.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Free.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, praise God. I trust that you
[45:15] enjoyed that. I really enjoyed it. I was
[45:18] so blessed. Sister Jennifer and I were
[45:19] just really blessed. And so, we thank
[45:22] God. You know, we were on vacation, but
[45:24] we never stop feeding on the word.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:26] &gt;&gt; No, sir. How can you can you go a day or
[45:29] two without eating? Sure, you can do
[45:31] that for a couple days. You can fast if
[45:33] you've got a purpose for it. But if you
[45:35] don't have a real reason for it, your
[45:37] stomach's going to hurt. Your body's
[45:39] going to react. you're, you know, so you
[45:41] need to feed, you know, and this word
[45:43] that we're feeding on in this hour, it's
[45:46] fresh.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; It's not stale. Amen. That's why this
[45:51] whole church, this whole ministry is
[45:54] based on the supernatural present stage
[45:59] of the ministry of Jesus Christ.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. So, this is Let's all
[46:04] stand and let's go to the word of God.
[46:06] We certainly want to remember
[46:09] um brother Bill uh you know that the
[46:12] Lord will finish the work. I believe
[46:13] that that he's already started the the
[46:16] process of healing in his body. We want
[46:19] to remember sister Sheila continue to
[46:21] pray that uh you know till complete and
[46:24] total victory. Amen. This is a great
[46:26] battle. These are these are sons and
[46:28] daughters of God that are standing on
[46:30] the word of God. You hear their
[46:32] testimony. They're not giving up.
[46:34] They're not bowing down. They're not
[46:36] they're they're they're not discouraged.
[46:37] They they are pressing on. They're
[46:40] pressing through. Amen. Praise God. And
[46:42] this is what we're doing. And so, let's
[46:45] remember them in prayer. And if you've
[46:46] got a need this morning, then raise your
[46:49] hand unto the Lord and say, "Lord,
[46:53] remember me. Father,
[46:56] truly Lord, this this opportunity every
[46:59] time that we come together like this,
[47:02] Lord, where
[47:03] you know a man stands behind the pulpit
[47:07] and Lord has been prepared and has taken
[47:12] the time to uh you know look into your
[47:15] desire, your inspiration, what what you
[47:18] would have for the people, Lord. And
[47:20] then the people, Lord, they've been
[47:22] toiling all week and they've been
[47:24] dealing with all kinds of situations in
[47:26] their lives. And Lord, it seems almost
[47:29] like, you know, Sunday comes or
[47:31] Wednesday comes and and the battle is so
[47:34] great, Lord, that it's so difficult even
[47:36] to get into your presence, even to come
[47:39] into the house of the Lord, Father. But
[47:41] Lord, is it ever worth it every time we
[47:44] come, Lord? I know for sure today, Lord,
[47:47] that your presence is here, that your
[47:50] desire is here, that your your your uh
[47:54] uh purpose and your desire for each and
[47:56] every individual, Father, if if if each
[48:00] one of us can just Lord, put aside
[48:02] everything now. Set aside our thoughts
[48:04] of the week and set aside our thoughts
[48:06] of the morning and the burden that lays
[48:09] heavy on our hearts, tiredness. Lord, we
[48:12] we we speak your word this morning in
[48:14] the name of Jesus Christ. And we bind
[48:17] these powers, these principalities,
[48:19] these oppressions that would try to
[48:21] hinder the people. Father, Lord, let
[48:23] there be liberty in the atmosphere this
[48:25] morning so that your word can have
[48:27] liberty, so that you can you can speak
[48:30] to to personal needs and and situations
[48:34] and you can speak life into those uh
[48:36] situations. You can bring healing to
[48:39] bodies that need healing. You can bring
[48:40] restoration to relationships that are
[48:43] broken. Lord, you can bring uh total
[48:47] liberty in in finance. Father, these are
[48:50] things that you're mindful of. You said
[48:52] that that that that above all things you
[48:54] would that we would prosper even as our
[48:57] soul prospers. Lord, you know that
[48:59] you've already got our soul. You've
[49:01] already taken it, Lord. You've already
[49:03] uh ordained it to life, Father. But
[49:05] Lord, we're the these souls. are still
[49:08] locked into these human realms of of
[49:11] flesh, Father, and they fight. They they
[49:14] they resist, Lord. They're at emnity,
[49:16] Father. Even our thoughts at times,
[49:19] Lord, are not our own thoughts. We know
[49:21] they they they are of the enemy, Lord,
[49:22] to try and turn us back. But your
[49:25] purpose is greater than all of that,
[49:27] Father. And that is what we look to uh
[49:30] uh you know, to to look into this
[49:32] morning, Lord, that you would open this
[49:34] up in a greater way. Lord, we've talked
[49:36] about the purpose-driven life. We've
[49:38] talked about all these things, but Lord,
[49:40] there's more to it, Father. There's a
[49:43] purpose for each and every one of us
[49:46] today,
[49:47] &gt;&gt; right now.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; And Lord, that's what we're interested
[49:50] in knowing, Lord, that you would come
[49:52] and meet that need. Lord, take control
[49:54] of this vessel. Anoint it to speak.
[49:57] Anoint every vessel that's here and
[50:00] online to to receive. Father, open the
[50:04] understanding.
[50:05] Only you can do that. Grant it, Father.
[50:09] We commit this service into your hands
[50:13] in Jesus name. Amen.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, we're looking at um the
[50:21] purpose of God. I believe, like I said,
[50:24] that this is going to be a springboard
[50:26] for the services that are up and coming.
[50:29] I believe that God has a purpose in
[50:32] bringing our young people together, in
[50:34] bringing us together. And I believe that
[50:36] that purpose is for us to recognize
[50:39] our purpose
[50:41] &gt;&gt; so that we can live it.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Recognize and act upon the word of God
[50:46] that God has made available to us in
[50:49] this day and in this hour. We can talk
[50:52] about purpose all day long, but until we
[50:54] come into that place where we where we
[50:57] where where we tap into the purpose of
[50:59] God and his desire, that changes
[51:02] everything, saints. And so, let's read
[51:04] our scripture from the book of Acts. But
[51:08] before that, I'd like um actually, yeah,
[51:15] we're going to read the book. Yeah,
[51:16] we'll read that and then we'll play the
[51:18] video. We've got a very short video that
[51:20] we want to play. And it says here in the
[51:22] book of Acts 13:36-39,
[51:25] it says, "For David after he had served
[51:29] his own generation
[51:31] by the will of God," I I emphasize that
[51:34] because you can take that and you can
[51:37] change will to purpose. You can change
[51:40] will to the plan of God. You can change
[51:43] that to the thoughts that the Lord had
[51:46] about David uh before the foundations of
[51:49] the world. Amen. And he fulfilled and
[51:53] served his generation by the will of God
[51:56] fell on sleep and was laid unto his
[51:59] fathers and saw corruption.
[52:02] But he whom God raised again saw no
[52:06] corruption. He's talking about Jesus
[52:08] Christ. Be it known unto you, therefore,
[52:11] men and brethren, that through this man,
[52:15] Jesus, is preached unto you, the
[52:18] forgiveness of sins, and by him all that
[52:22] believe are justified from all things,
[52:26] from which ye could not be justified by
[52:30] the law of Moses.
[52:33] Blessed be the name of the Lord. The
[52:34] Lord add his blessings to the word of
[52:36] God. You may be seated. A Glory.
[52:40] Hallelujah. You know that's that's just
[52:43] wonderful. You know when we look at this
[52:45] scripture here and you know uh you know
[52:47] the book of acts is is not about the
[52:49] acts of the apostles not about the acts
[52:52] of the disciples or the common people.
[52:55] It's it's about the acts of the Holy
[52:57] Spirit
[52:59] moving in and through the people,
[53:02] placing them, giving them position in
[53:05] the word of God and giving them a word
[53:07] and a message that they would take into
[53:11] all the world. Amen. Praise God. Before
[53:14] we go into
[53:16] the actual service, I just want to play
[53:18] this video. It'll give us an opportunity
[53:21] to test our new projection system and at
[53:24] the same time give us a little
[53:28] quick inspiration.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; We all want a life that matters. So we
[53:35] pour ourselves into our work, our
[53:38] relationships, our experiences, and our
[53:41] achievements, always searching for some
[53:44] deeper sense of meaning.
[53:46] But in the pauses between our striving,
[53:49] we still feel like there's something
[53:51] missing.
[53:53] What if the problem isn't our desire for
[53:55] purpose, but in where we're looking to
[53:57] find it?
[53:59] Real fulfillment starts with a shift in
[54:01] focus. It happens when we respond to the
[54:04] love of God that's never stopped
[54:06] reaching toward us.
[54:08] Because true purpose isn't something we
[54:11] earn. It's something we find when we
[54:13] surrender.
[54:16] This is where you step into all that God
[54:18] has for you and into all that he desires
[54:21] for your life, no matter what the cost.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Well, that was nice and
[54:32] clear.
[54:37] Now, we trust that the word of God is
[54:39] going to be nice and clear.
[54:41] Amen. Praise God. So today I'd like to
[54:44] look at you know uh the purpose of God
[54:48] and you know living a life of purpose
[54:52] you know
[54:54] purposeful living. Amen. Glory to God.
[54:57] But you know in order to do that we need
[54:59] to recognize what our purpose is where
[55:03] we fit. How we fit into God's plan in
[55:06] this day and in this hour. The scripture
[55:09] that we read here, you know, it it
[55:12] defines what the meaning to live for God
[55:15] is and to live, you know, your purpose
[55:17] in your generation. You know, David
[55:20] lived his purpose in his generation. And
[55:23] David was not perfect in his generation.
[55:27] So, we're not looking at, you know, a
[55:29] perfect life. We're not looking at a at
[55:32] a life that, you know, that has to be
[55:33] absolutely perfect and so supernatural
[55:37] in everything that we do and religious.
[55:39] We're not looking for that. We're
[55:42] looking for a natural life that that has
[55:45] a supernatural element built into it to
[55:48] recognize God's desire and purpose for
[55:52] you.
[55:54] Amen. What a statement was made about
[55:57] David that he served his purpose in his
[56:01] generation.
[56:03] Would you like that statement to be said
[56:05] about you?
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. This description defines the type
[56:10] of life that we as Christians should
[56:13] strive towards,
[56:16] motivating us and moving us forward down
[56:19] the path that the Lord has for us.
[56:23] Can you imagine this being said about
[56:25] us? If the Lord should terry and some of
[56:28] us have to go by the grave, I would want
[56:31] to hear that said about me, about you
[56:37] that you served your purpose in the
[56:40] generation that you were called to this
[56:42] message.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God. that that at our graduation
[56:49] service that would be said, well done.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Well done in serving the Lord in in in
[56:58] letting go of everything. Like the video
[56:59] said, at whatever cost
[57:02] once the purpose of God was revealed and
[57:05] made known, everything else had to come
[57:08] subject to that purpose.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. that we served God's
[57:14] purpose for this generation in our
[57:16] homes, in our communities,
[57:19] in our workplaces,
[57:21] in whatever area that you've been placed
[57:24] here in this life,
[57:27] people will look and say that person
[57:30] served God.
[57:32] They had a purpose in serving God.
[57:37] Every time we would talk about things,
[57:39] they would inject just, you know,
[57:43] lightly inject,
[57:45] you know, God has a plan. God has a
[57:48] purpose in all of these things.
[57:51] Amen.
[57:52] But what happens when you don't have
[57:54] purpose?
[57:56] You know, I remember as a young person
[57:59] that um I had, you know, ever since I
[58:02] was like early teens, I just wanted to
[58:07] be a successful businessman. I would
[58:10] have lawnmower business. I would have
[58:13] paper roots. I would be shoveling snow
[58:16] in the in the winter. I I'd be painting
[58:19] people's homes. I'd be looking, knocking
[58:22] on their doors, trying to, you know,
[58:24] because I had this desire because I was
[58:26] brought up in a family where nothing was
[58:28] given to me. When my dad said, "You want
[58:31] this, you got to work.
[58:34] You want money, you got to go do this.
[58:36] You got to go and work for your money."
[58:38] And so I, you know, as as young, you
[58:40] know, we're taught that in this world,
[58:42] you got to work and you've got to
[58:44] strive. And you know, as I got older,
[58:48] you know, into my late teens, I I
[58:50] started to, you know, you know, look
[58:52] deeper and I' I'd look into, you know,
[58:55] um, different, uh, you know, programs
[58:58] on, you know, on how to develop a
[59:00] successful attitude and how to, you
[59:03] know, develop, uh, you know, um, a
[59:06] mental attitude that would that would
[59:08] bring success into my life. And I
[59:10] started taking all these different
[59:12] courses, you know, as I got into my
[59:14] early 20s. and I'd be listening to
[59:16] these, you know, um, personal
[59:18] development motivators and and they
[59:20] would excite me because I would be able
[59:22] to grasp, you know, a little glimpse.
[59:24] And one of the things that they always
[59:27] made very clear that I can remember was
[59:29] a was a was a a thread that ran through
[59:32] all of those teachings was you need to
[59:35] set goals.
[59:37] if you have no goals or purpose because
[59:42] a goal what it does is it sets something
[59:46] you know a destination for your life and
[59:49] in order for you to have you know like
[59:51] so they would tell you you know like you
[59:52] got to write your goals you want to you
[59:55] want to earn a a $100,000 a year you
[59:59] need to write yourself a check and place
[1:00:02] that check on the wall and you need to
[1:00:04] look at that check every single day and
[1:00:07] you need to affirm it in your mind and
[1:00:09] in your thoughts that I am going to earn
[1:00:13] $100,000
[1:00:14] per year. I will earn 100. And then as
[1:00:18] your goals started to grow and your your
[1:00:20] vision started to expand, you would you
[1:00:23] would you would set these higher goals
[1:00:25] for your life. And you know, you'd you'd
[1:00:27] put pictures of of boats and and houses
[1:00:31] and and cars and and money. You would
[1:00:35] you would put all these things around
[1:00:36] you, you know, uh because and and this
[1:00:39] is all scriptural,
[1:00:42] you know, like David said, you know, let
[1:00:44] let
[1:00:45] me see you on the doorpost. Let me see
[1:00:47] you here, there, everywhere, Lord, you
[1:00:49] know, but it was a perversion.
[1:00:52] It was a total perversion because no
[1:00:54] matter what and especially
[1:00:58] if you're a son or a daughter of God,
[1:01:01] and this is the element that we're
[1:01:03] trying to discover here,
[1:01:06] that because we are sons and daughters
[1:01:09] of God, we need to discover his purpose
[1:01:12] for our lives.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] and all that I was doing in in all of
[1:01:19] those trainings and developing and many
[1:01:21] of you have probably done it and you you
[1:01:24] know you still may be doing it and
[1:01:25] that's good because now you've got a
[1:01:27] revelation on it. There's nothing wrong
[1:01:29] with positive affirmation. There's
[1:01:31] nothing wrong with visualizing.
[1:01:33] God is a visualizer. God saw
[1:01:37] in his mind
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; exactly what he was going to create
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; and it manifested and you as a son or
[1:01:46] daughter of God have that same image
[1:01:50] built into you as an attribute of God.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Once you come into your total, you know,
[1:01:56] understanding of this, it changes your
[1:01:58] your your entire life. Once you realize
[1:02:01] that that the one that that created the
[1:02:03] universe has a purpose to dwell in you
[1:02:06] in this hour and you have the ability to
[1:02:09] speak God's thoughts into the
[1:02:12] circumstances and the situations but
[1:02:14] with character
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; with understanding with revelation
[1:02:18] not with with the teachings of man like
[1:02:22] this that I just mentioned to you. It's
[1:02:25] all based on man's teachings, man's
[1:02:27] ideas, and and you set goals.
[1:02:32] But goals are important
[1:02:34] in the mind of God. God sent forth
[1:02:38] attributes
[1:02:40] which were were his thoughts and his
[1:02:43] goals into each and every generation.
[1:02:47] And each generation would bring forth
[1:02:50] the purpose of God in that particular
[1:02:53] generation. And that's why David when
[1:02:55] when God chose David from a from a from
[1:02:58] a you know from a young shepherd in the
[1:03:00] field who was just a young you know man.
[1:03:03] God saw in David before anybody else
[1:03:07] could see it. He saw that there was a
[1:03:09] king there.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. That there would be one after his
[1:03:13] own heart.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; That there would be one whom he would
[1:03:17] use. But David was also just a man.
[1:03:21] Amen. And that's what we need to
[1:03:23] understand that that we're still human
[1:03:26] beings here on this earth and we have to
[1:03:28] deal with situations in our lives and we
[1:03:30] have to overcome things in our lives in
[1:03:33] order to get to the place where God's
[1:03:35] purpose can start to take control and
[1:03:38] have total preeminence in our lives.
[1:03:41] Amen. So many of these teachings would
[1:03:44] use the scriptures like as a man thinks
[1:03:46] in his heart so is he.
[1:03:50] And they would teach those, you know,
[1:03:51] I'd listen to some, you know, uh,
[1:03:54] personal development speakers that were
[1:03:55] actually ministers. Zigg Ziggler, he's
[1:03:59] one of the ones that comes to my mind.
[1:04:00] He was a he was a a minister and yet he
[1:04:03] was a a a professional development
[1:04:05] speaker on on positive mental attitude
[1:04:09] and how to bring how to bring prosperity
[1:04:11] into your life and all of those things.
[1:04:14] you know, seeing yourself imagining all
[1:04:15] these things. But but as a son or a
[1:04:19] daughter of God, this when when I came
[1:04:22] to the Lord 31 years ago ago,
[1:04:26] all those things that had been laid in
[1:04:29] as foundations as I was coming to my
[1:04:33] calling, my my placing in the word of
[1:04:36] God until God, all those things, they
[1:04:39] all made sense when God gave me the
[1:04:42] first revelation on himself. Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Because I was desiring to satisfy a
[1:04:51] thirst.
[1:04:53] And if you've got a thirst for God in
[1:04:55] your soul and you don't understand that
[1:04:58] thirst because you're still unsatisfied,
[1:05:02] you're still in a condition that that
[1:05:04] that even though you come to church
[1:05:06] every Sunday, every Wednesday,
[1:05:09] you come in, you get you get the
[1:05:11] anointing on you, you rejoice, and then
[1:05:13] a few days later, you're miserable,
[1:05:16] you're depressed, you're wondering
[1:05:18] whether God even called you. you get
[1:05:21] into these conditions. What is it? It's
[1:05:24] because you fully have not come into
[1:05:26] that that that that absolute purpose and
[1:05:30] plan of God. You haven't recognized it
[1:05:32] yet and you haven't surrendered your
[1:05:34] life to the things that are keeping you
[1:05:37] bound
[1:05:39] in this world.
[1:05:42] Amen. We need his purpose. God's purpose
[1:05:46] overrides all your goals.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. When I came to realize, I said, I
[1:05:53] remember I remember telling Pastor Simon
[1:05:55] when when when when this revelation came
[1:05:57] on my uh in my life and it transformed
[1:06:00] my whole life, everything all I could
[1:06:02] all I all I desired was to to to make
[1:06:06] sure that everything around my life
[1:06:08] would only look at that purpose that the
[1:06:12] coming of the Lord that that God was
[1:06:14] real that he'd actually called he'd
[1:06:16] actually called me and called my family
[1:06:18] out of this world. I didn't want
[1:06:20] anything else. I just wanted to serve
[1:06:21] God. I wanted to let go of everything. I
[1:06:23] said, "Brother, I'm going to sell the
[1:06:25] businesses. I'm going to I'm going to
[1:06:26] get rid of all these things." You Whoa,
[1:06:28] whoa, whoa. Easy, brother. Slow down.
[1:06:31] You see, because because that awakening
[1:06:35] when it happens, you know, it it it
[1:06:38] brings his purpose to the forefront and
[1:06:41] then all of a sudden everything else
[1:06:43] around you just becomes secondary.
[1:06:47] That's how you know that you've that
[1:06:49] you've genuinely come into a a a
[1:06:53] relationship with the Lord,
[1:06:56] you know, like it's it's something that
[1:06:58] that you you realize that you're it's
[1:07:01] not a sensation. It wasn't a sensation.
[1:07:04] It wasn't a uh you know, that that that
[1:07:06] I met a a supernatural angel that that
[1:07:09] spoke to me. It had nothing to do with
[1:07:12] all that. It was a divine revelation of
[1:07:15] something that had taken place on the
[1:07:18] inside of the inside that no man can
[1:07:21] explain that.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; It's called the purpose of God.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; It's called the attribute of God. Every
[1:07:29] single attribute that God sent forth had
[1:07:33] a purpose instilled within that
[1:07:35] attribute. It had a time and a season
[1:07:38] when it would come into manifestation.
[1:07:42] And so this element takes place in every
[1:07:47] single life that once you are truly born
[1:07:52] again and your experience with the Lord
[1:07:55] is is it it has become your absolute
[1:07:59] then all the purposes all the goals that
[1:08:03] you had that's why you know a lot of the
[1:08:06] people like you know I remember in the
[1:08:08] early days like I was very active with
[1:08:12] friends,
[1:08:13] traveling, going golfing three times a
[1:08:17] year away, golfing three times a week,
[1:08:22] you know, going to the bars, very
[1:08:25] active, had a wide, you know,
[1:08:27] surrounding of friends in many areas of
[1:08:30] my life. And I remember when that time
[1:08:33] came, it was like they everything just
[1:08:36] faded out.
[1:08:38] It just completely faded away. And
[1:08:41] people were wondering, "What's the
[1:08:42] matter with you? You're not coming this
[1:08:44] year. Are you you you're the life of the
[1:08:48] party a lot of the times with the jokes
[1:08:50] and with the this and you know, come on,
[1:08:53] Dan. You're not No, I No, I'm not that
[1:08:56] person anymore.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Purpose changed. The goals changed.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; All of a sudden, all those desires for
[1:09:04] for riches and and for wealth and all
[1:09:07] those things. Now God brings that all
[1:09:10] into balance as we mature and as we grow
[1:09:12] in the Lord.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Because those things are also part of
[1:09:18] serving the Lord.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:20] when when when you know, brother Simon
[1:09:22] was bringing all those series on
[1:09:24] prosperity and like how God wants you to
[1:09:27] prosper and all of those things. I
[1:09:30] remember I I was feeding on that word
[1:09:33] because I had to override a lot of of a
[1:09:36] lot of the mental legalism that I that I
[1:09:39] had taken into my mind because that's
[1:09:41] what happens, you know. you know, uh,
[1:09:43] and and that's that's what this whole
[1:09:45] message has gone through. And that's why
[1:09:47] there's a mess within the message is
[1:09:50] because a lot of a lot of people took
[1:09:53] the things that were spoken by the
[1:09:55] prophet and made those things either too
[1:09:58] liberal or totally legalistic to the
[1:10:01] point where people got into total
[1:10:03] confusion.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; And now they're not serving their
[1:10:06] purpose. They're not recognizing what it
[1:10:08] is that God wants them to fulfill. I
[1:10:12] thank God for a a pastor that over the
[1:10:14] last 30 years was was balanced, that was
[1:10:18] able to walk down the middle of the road
[1:10:20] and look at all of these factions. Look
[1:10:22] at this thunder movement. Look at this
[1:10:24] Peruia movement. Look at this. The seal
[1:10:26] ain't open. The seal is open. all these
[1:10:29] things allowing us to be to be uh you
[1:10:33] know like like uh uh weathered and and
[1:10:37] and and matured through it all by
[1:10:40] allowing ourselves you know that he
[1:10:42] wouldn't he wouldn't point us to it. But
[1:10:44] he wouldn't he wouldn't like take it and
[1:10:46] say you got to stay away from that. You
[1:10:48] that's wrong. That's no no no no. He
[1:10:50] would just preach the word.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; And this is what we need to understand
[1:10:55] in this hour that the word and the
[1:10:57] purpose of God in this hour is for us to
[1:11:00] preach the word.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; The word that is in season.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. not to be filtered or or or or
[1:11:09] placed under a legalistic interpretation
[1:11:13] or to you know everything is finding the
[1:11:15] middle of the road.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. And so this is why you
[1:11:23] know our lives you know
[1:11:26] we're overridden
[1:11:28] by the purpose of God.
[1:11:31] But let's let's look at the next
[1:11:33] scripture here. We're going to move
[1:11:34] along here.
[1:11:36] in the book of Ecclesiastes.
[1:11:39] Well, actually, before we go there,
[1:11:41] before we go there, just go back for a
[1:11:43] minute. I want to read a couple of
[1:11:46] things here that I found very
[1:11:47] interesting.
[1:11:49] um because we're going to be looking at
[1:11:50] Ecclesiastes because, you know, Solomon
[1:11:52] brought out some beautiful thoughts and
[1:11:54] understanding on, you know, the purpose
[1:11:58] of life and how, you know, you can find
[1:12:02] that that there's a lot of vanity in
[1:12:05] life if you're not looking in the right
[1:12:07] places. But, you know, but if if we just
[1:12:10] look for a few minutes here at a life
[1:12:11] without purpose, you know, sometimes I
[1:12:14] get ahead of my notes. You know, during
[1:12:16] times of war, prison guards were known
[1:12:19] to give prisoners the task of digging a
[1:12:22] great big hole. He would give them
[1:12:25] shovels and a big burlap bag and sacks
[1:12:28] to dig and carry the dirt to the other
[1:12:30] side of the compound. Generally, this
[1:12:33] was done during the heat of the day
[1:12:35] because these were prisoners of war. And
[1:12:38] the prisoners would work for months
[1:12:41] digging these holes. And when the job
[1:12:43] was finished, the prisoners would feel a
[1:12:45] little satisfaction.
[1:12:48] The hole's been completed.
[1:12:51] The dirt pile is moved where they wanted
[1:12:53] it.
[1:12:55] But moving the dirt, okay, but then the
[1:12:59] prison guard would give them a new
[1:13:01] burlap sack and tell them to refill the
[1:13:04] hole with the dirt that they just moved.
[1:13:08] And it would take them weeks and months
[1:13:11] to do the same thing. And now they're
[1:13:14] doing it
[1:13:16] arbitrarily.
[1:13:25] So some of the prisoners couldn't handle
[1:13:27] it. If they had been moving dirt for for
[1:13:29] for a reason, if there was a purpose for
[1:13:33] moving the dirt, well, then there would
[1:13:34] be some satisfaction. But moving the
[1:13:37] dirt for no reason at all for months
[1:13:39] without any purpose
[1:13:42] would would drive them completely
[1:13:45] insane.
[1:13:46] And this is something that we need to
[1:13:48] just draw a little thought from there
[1:13:50] that you know without a purpose, without
[1:13:55] having some sort of of clarity,
[1:13:59] we can get into a rat race where we're
[1:14:02] doing the same thing over and over and
[1:14:06] over again. You Oh, I go to church. I am
[1:14:09] I'm one of the best church members. I'm
[1:14:11] there every Sunday. You know, you're
[1:14:14] doing it over and over and over again,
[1:14:17] but you haven't discovered the purpose
[1:14:21] of why God is speaking to you personally
[1:14:25] and placing you and positioning you for
[1:14:28] the rapture.
[1:14:31] As humans, we weren't built like this.
[1:14:34] We need to know that there's a purpose
[1:14:36] in whatever we do. So, living without
[1:14:38] purpose is insanity. Actually, there's a
[1:14:41] book in the Bible that gives us insight,
[1:14:44] and this book is from the book of
[1:14:46] Ecclesiastes.
[1:14:48] And so, now, you know, I believe that
[1:14:50] the Holy Spirit inspired Solomon with
[1:14:53] these inspirations. And so, now let's
[1:14:55] read, you know, the first scripture. It
[1:14:57] says, "Vanity of vanities, saith the
[1:15:00] preacher." Vanity of vanities. All is
[1:15:04] vanity.
[1:15:05] What profitth had a man of all his
[1:15:07] labor, which he taketh under the sun?
[1:15:10] One generation passeth away, another
[1:15:12] generation comes, but the earth abideth
[1:15:15] forever. The sun also rise and the sun
[1:15:20] goes down and hastes to his place where
[1:15:23] he arose.
[1:15:25] You know, you know, they say Solomon was
[1:15:28] one of the wisest men that ever lived
[1:15:31] and he tried living his life for various
[1:15:34] purposes.
[1:15:35] He tried living his life for
[1:15:38] possessions. So he went out and
[1:15:40] accumulated great wealth.
[1:15:43] He was actually considered the
[1:15:44] wealthiest wealthiest person in the
[1:15:46] world uh to to ever live. But what he
[1:15:50] found is that living life for the
[1:15:52] purpose of possessions is a wasted life.
[1:15:55] And we can get caught up in, you know,
[1:15:58] in everything being possession,
[1:16:00] everything being, you know, getting
[1:16:02] ahead financially, getting ahead bigger
[1:16:05] house, getting ahead with, uh, you know,
[1:16:07] with with better clothes and and and and
[1:16:10] all these things. We can get we can get
[1:16:13] off track by those things. Those things
[1:16:16] when they line up with the purpose of
[1:16:18] God, they fall together perfectly.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; All those things. That's why the
[1:16:23] scripture says, "Seek first the kingdom
[1:16:25] of God." Next, Solomon tried living a
[1:16:28] life for prestige and power. He actually
[1:16:31] became the most powerful man in the
[1:16:33] world. Kings and queens came from around
[1:16:36] the world just to see his magnificence
[1:16:39] and hear what he had to say because he
[1:16:42] had such wisdom and understanding. But
[1:16:44] Solomon found that living for power was
[1:16:46] unfulfilling.
[1:16:49] Finally, he tried living life for
[1:16:50] pleasure.
[1:16:52] Nothing was withheld from him. He had
[1:16:55] 700 wives and over 300 concubines.
[1:17:01] He also built entire cities just to hold
[1:17:04] his sports cars, his chariots,
[1:17:08] his horses.
[1:17:10] But again, he found it all in vain and
[1:17:15] without value.
[1:17:19] Praise God. Solomon lived for everything
[1:17:22] the world values but found that he had
[1:17:25] no real purpose
[1:17:28] with this kind of understanding.
[1:17:31] Solomon under the inspiration of the
[1:17:32] Holy Spirit wrote the book of
[1:17:34] Ecclesiastes and he talks about what
[1:17:36] happens when we don't know the real
[1:17:38] meaning of life. That's what we can draw
[1:17:40] from these scriptures to cause us to
[1:17:43] look into the real purpose that God has
[1:17:45] for each and every one of us. what his
[1:17:48] purpose. Solomon gives us five tragic
[1:17:51] consequences of living life without
[1:17:53] purpose.
[1:17:55] This is all laying in a little
[1:17:56] foundation here so that we can
[1:17:58] springboard from here because a lot of
[1:18:00] our young people, they don't realize
[1:18:02] that the the the world that's around
[1:18:05] them and and and all of the media and
[1:18:08] all of these, you know, these sites,
[1:18:10] they they're creating worlds
[1:18:13] that don't exist.
[1:18:15] They exist in in in in one in a million
[1:18:20] because they're stars or because they're
[1:18:22] they've made, you know, great wealth and
[1:18:24] and those are one in a million that
[1:18:26] reach those levels. But yet they want
[1:18:28] these people. These people go out and
[1:18:31] they and they and they set up their
[1:18:33] Instagrams and all these things and they
[1:18:35] get followers. And what they're trying
[1:18:37] to do is they're trying to capture the
[1:18:39] minds of our young people to create uh
[1:18:42] futures and lives that don't really
[1:18:45] exist. Getting them to to create a
[1:18:48] future without God.
[1:18:53] Amen.
[1:18:55] A life without purpose is totally
[1:18:57] useless.
[1:18:59] Vanity of vanity, says the preacher.
[1:19:01] Vanity, it's all vanity. This word
[1:19:04] vanity is not what many people think
[1:19:07] because it has nothing to do with having
[1:19:09] excessive pride in oneself or one's
[1:19:12] appearance. Rather in the Hebrew
[1:19:15] language the word means useless,
[1:19:20] meaningless
[1:19:22] that all these great achievements of you
[1:19:25] know fixing your face so that you can
[1:19:28] you know you so that you can look
[1:19:29] younger and and and and wearing clothes
[1:19:32] that are that are like sexier and you
[1:19:35] know so that you can attract the right
[1:19:37] person and and and having great
[1:19:40] possessions and fancy cars and all those
[1:19:42] things. Without God's purpose in your
[1:19:46] life, young people, you will be drawn
[1:19:48] into a life of hardship. Sure, one out
[1:19:52] of 10, one out of a hundred are going to
[1:19:55] make it and they're going to say, "Oh,
[1:19:56] yes, I'm happy." But then look at them
[1:19:58] maybe five or 10 years down the road and
[1:20:00] see if their life is still a life that
[1:20:04] has purpose and destination to it.
[1:20:08] see if they're if the direction that
[1:20:10] they're walking in is leading them into
[1:20:13] a better life or a broken marriage
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; or a dysfunctional relationship with
[1:20:19] their friends, their families, their
[1:20:22] parents,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; vanity.
[1:20:27] It's all meaningless. And what Solomon
[1:20:30] is saying is that living a life without
[1:20:32] the purpose of God is useless and
[1:20:35] without meaning.
[1:20:37] The problem is that far too many people
[1:20:40] simply want to only do enough and they
[1:20:43] want a quick way to get to where they
[1:20:46] want to go. They they they want a quick
[1:20:49] fix.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; That's why nowadays the women, they can
[1:20:52] go into a beauty parlor. If they've got
[1:20:55] a sagging face over here or they've got
[1:20:57] something wrong over there, they can go
[1:20:58] in and get a quick fix.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; But they don't realize that they're just
[1:21:02] setting themselves up for something down
[1:21:04] the road. Amen. We're not looking for
[1:21:07] quick fixes. We're looking for the plan
[1:21:09] and the purpose of God.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; And when his purpose becomes the
[1:21:13] forefront of your life, then your your
[1:21:16] own beauty is not is not based on your
[1:21:19] outward appearance.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; The true beauty now becomes your
[1:21:22] character,
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; your your your nature.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; The nature of God starts to express
[1:21:28] itself through your life. And people
[1:21:30] start to realize a beauty that's on you
[1:21:33] that goes beyond human beauty.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; It's when God's purpose.
[1:21:42] So we need to understand that that you
[1:21:45] know living this kind of a life for
[1:21:49] desiring
[1:21:51] things
[1:21:52] can lead to absolute heartache
[1:21:58] and destruction.
[1:22:00] Life without purpose is tiring.
[1:22:03] Look at he says it here. The sun also
[1:22:06] rises and the sun goes down and hastens
[1:22:08] to the place where it arose. The wind
[1:22:11] goes towards the south and turns around
[1:22:13] to the north. The winds whirl
[1:22:15] continually and comes again on its
[1:22:18] circuit. All the rivers run into the
[1:22:20] sea. Yet the sea is not full to the
[1:22:23] place from which the rivers come. What's
[1:22:26] he saying? Life without purpose is a
[1:22:28] life that goes around in circles. And
[1:22:31] Solomon gives us three examples of this
[1:22:34] sort of circular living. First is the
[1:22:37] rotation of the sun. He says it just
[1:22:39] keeps coming and it keeps going. Things
[1:22:42] don't change and you're living a life
[1:22:44] and you're caught into this circle of
[1:22:46] life that is useless. And he gives it
[1:22:49] the example through the wind. And then
[1:22:50] he gives the example through the rivers.
[1:22:52] Another way to say this is that it's
[1:22:55] like we're on a great big treadmill.
[1:23:00] Using up a whole lot of energy and going
[1:23:02] a whole lot nowhere.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:10] And you know if you ask people right
[1:23:12] now, you ask people how you doing? You
[1:23:14] know what most people are going to say?
[1:23:15] Oh brother, I'm tired.
[1:23:18] Oh man, I'm tired. You know, you know
[1:23:21] why they're tired? Because they're just
[1:23:23] doing the same old thing and they don't
[1:23:25] have a purpose.
[1:23:27] We need to refocus ourselves into the
[1:23:30] purpose of God.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; It'll change everything. It'll it'll
[1:23:34] it'll put a light onto your feet because
[1:23:37] now God's God's now saying, "Yes, you've
[1:23:40] caught my thought. You've caught my
[1:23:42] desire. You've caught my purpose for
[1:23:44] your life." Amen. Glory to God.
[1:23:48] Let's go to the next slide. Ecclesiastes
[1:23:50] 1:8-9. All things are full of labor. Man
[1:23:53] cannot utter it. The eye is not
[1:23:55] satisfied with seeing, nor the ear
[1:23:57] filled with hearing. The thing that hath
[1:23:59] been is that which shall be, and that
[1:24:02] which is done is that which shall be
[1:24:04] done. And there is no new thing under
[1:24:07] the sun. People are striving to find
[1:24:10] something new to do. I got to get a new
[1:24:12] house. I got to get a new car. I got to
[1:24:14] get a new, you know, every week they
[1:24:17] want new clothes because they get, you
[1:24:19] know, they they figure the clothes will
[1:24:20] make them feel better, look better, all
[1:24:22] these things. Always constantly looking
[1:24:25] to to to do things in order to produce
[1:24:28] things. But all things are, you know,
[1:24:31] Solomon is saying that without purpose,
[1:24:33] there's never going to be a
[1:24:35] satisfaction.
[1:24:37] That is nothing of this world can
[1:24:39] satisfy what the human soul desires.
[1:24:43] That attribute that God has placed in
[1:24:45] you desires the word.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; You may not know it yet, but when you
[1:24:50] come into these services and you come
[1:24:53] under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:55] and the Lord starts to water his word,
[1:24:59] he starts to water that attribute that
[1:25:01] was placed in you before the foundations
[1:25:03] of the world. The purpose of God starts
[1:25:06] to light up in your life.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. When we see no point
[1:25:12] to life, we become restless. You know,
[1:25:15] consider the TV remote. You know, these
[1:25:17] are things that I picked up here. He
[1:25:18] says, you know, the average person will
[1:25:20] change channels 325,000
[1:25:23] times in their lifetime.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Some people do it in a week.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Nothing makes me happy.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God, brother. G.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; You can never totally satisfy a son or a
[1:25:39] daughter of God until God's purpose is
[1:25:42] in them.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; It settles everything.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; We don't see any purpose in life. Then
[1:25:49] we get restless and life will be
[1:25:52] unfulfilling. Life without purpose is
[1:25:54] insignificant.
[1:25:56] He goes on, you know, if you read the
[1:25:58] whole chapter, he goes on, there is no
[1:26:00] remembrance of for former things, nor
[1:26:02] will there be any remembrance of things
[1:26:05] that are to come by those who will come
[1:26:07] after.
[1:26:09] You got to live a life and you know,
[1:26:11] listen,
[1:26:13] a generation goes by, two generations go
[1:26:16] by, three generations go by, by the time
[1:26:19] you get to the second and third
[1:26:20] generation, you don't remember those
[1:26:22] people. you don't remember uh you know
[1:26:26] the significance of their lives. Their
[1:26:29] lives just pass. In other words, they if
[1:26:32] if they had no purpose, if they had if
[1:26:35] they had not lived in their generation
[1:26:37] according to their purpose in God, they
[1:26:40] are forgotten.
[1:26:43] And we've got a a generation of young
[1:26:45] people that are now in the third and
[1:26:47] fourth generation just like they were
[1:26:50] back in in when they came out into the
[1:26:52] into the wilderness. There there came a
[1:26:54] generation that forgot Moses
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; that that knew not Moses. And here we
[1:27:00] are. We're talking about preserving the
[1:27:02] word in our young people. They need to
[1:27:05] know that God sent a prophet. They need
[1:27:07] to know the purpose of God sending a
[1:27:10] prophet. They need to understand the
[1:27:12] dispensational changes and and the
[1:27:15] fulfillment of the purpose of God in
[1:27:17] each and every one of those
[1:27:19] dispensations and individuals that God
[1:27:21] used to bring us to this day.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; This message was brought to us by
[1:27:27] individuals that had to sacrifice their
[1:27:30] lives to the purpose of God.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; We have this message today because of
[1:27:35] those individuals.
[1:27:37] We have this message today because of
[1:27:40] those that even went off the word.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Those that that that went off into
[1:27:45] certain, you know, uh teachings, whether
[1:27:48] it be the thunders or the perusia, those
[1:27:50] things were there. God permitted those
[1:27:53] things to to come into the message in
[1:27:56] order to allow the the genuine reality
[1:27:58] of the message to surface
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; so that the real so so that the real
[1:28:03] truth could could be made known. They
[1:28:05] were partial truths. They had a purpose.
[1:28:08] They God permitted it. God allowed it to
[1:28:11] come in order to to meet and and to and
[1:28:13] to deal with with certain other
[1:28:15] standards that were coming up within the
[1:28:17] message to try and bring it down.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; But God would always raise a standard
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; by his word. And how would he do it?
[1:28:27] He'd go to certain individuals
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; and he'd awaken his purpose in them.
[1:28:35] Hallelujah.
[1:28:39] Fame is fleeting.
[1:28:41] What what you know what use is 15
[1:28:44] minutes of fame, you know, or five
[1:28:47] minutes if if you're lucky, you break a
[1:28:49] record and and it's a broken record and
[1:28:52] you know 20 minutes the two three days
[1:28:54] later it's forgotten. People looking for
[1:28:56] fame.
[1:28:58] That's not going to bring us happiness.
[1:29:00] That's not going to bring us what God
[1:29:02] desires to accomplish in our lives.
[1:29:04] Amen. Regardless of what you've
[1:29:07] accomplished, most of it will be
[1:29:08] forgotten over time. Consider the names
[1:29:11] that that grace various buildings and
[1:29:14] schools. Most of them have no idea who
[1:29:17] these people are. They go to those
[1:29:19] schools. They don't know who this person
[1:29:21] is. They have no idea
[1:29:24] because time
[1:29:27] disintegrates all of those things. But
[1:29:29] the word of God will remain.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; You could gain the wealth of the world
[1:29:35] like Elon Musk and yet deny that God
[1:29:38] even exists.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Life without a purpose. Jesus said in
[1:29:45] Mark 8:36 37, "For what shall it profit
[1:29:49] a man if he shall gain the whole world
[1:29:51] and lose his own soul?"
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Or what shall a a man give in exchange
[1:29:56] for his soul? This is the reality
[1:30:00] of the sons and daughters of God. Amen.
[1:30:03] Life without purpose seems insignificant
[1:30:06] when compared
[1:30:07] to eternity and the plan that God has
[1:30:10] for our lives.
[1:30:13] It's uncontrollable. Let's go to our
[1:30:15] next slide.
[1:30:20] All things are full of labor. No, next
[1:30:22] one. Sorry.
[1:30:26] I commune with my own heart saying lo I
[1:30:29] am come to great estate. But here
[1:30:31] Solomon he came to a place where you
[1:30:33] know he started to commune within
[1:30:34] himself. And every single one of us must
[1:30:37] come to a place like this in our lives
[1:30:40] and have gotten more wisdom than all
[1:30:43] they that have been before me in
[1:30:45] Jerusalem. Yay. My heart had great
[1:30:47] experience of wisdom and knowledge. And
[1:30:49] I gave my heart to know wisdom and to
[1:30:51] know madness and folly. I perceive that
[1:30:54] this also is vexation of the spirit.
[1:30:59] For in much wisdom is much grief, and he
[1:31:03] that increasth knowledge increased
[1:31:06] sorrow. So you can become the smartest
[1:31:09] individual. I'm going to have every
[1:31:11] degree that I can possibly get. I'm
[1:31:14] going to have LLDs, PhDs, all these, you
[1:31:17] know, MDs and all these, you know,
[1:31:20] things. Uh, bachelor of arts and all
[1:31:22] these things. Young people, these are
[1:31:24] these are okay,
[1:31:26] but you need to look to see how they
[1:31:29] come in line with the purpose of God in
[1:31:33] your life. Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Think about, you know, you want to go
[1:31:37] out and you want to be like a a a a
[1:31:40] hip-hop singer.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; You know, you you you want to rap,
[1:31:47] but hey, you want to rap gospel music
[1:31:50] and you think, well, this is well, I'm
[1:31:52] I'm I'm rapping gospel.
[1:31:57] That doesn't line up with the purpose of
[1:31:58] God.
[1:32:00] that doesn't have the spirit of God on
[1:32:03] it.
[1:32:05] You could have a gift to sing. You could
[1:32:08] have a gift of the Holy Spirit. You
[1:32:10] could have a baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:32:13] all
[1:32:14] 10 times a day and still have a soul
[1:32:17] that's bound for hell
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; because you haven't you you you you
[1:32:23] haven't discovered that there's an
[1:32:25] actual attribute in you that has a
[1:32:27] purpose. And when that purpose comes to
[1:32:30] the surface, that rap music's got to go.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Because it brings it subject to the
[1:32:37] purpose of God in your life.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; It cannot remain
[1:32:42] in your life
[1:32:45] if the attribute has been awakened in
[1:32:47] your life. Amen.
[1:32:50] You can learn all the greatest things
[1:32:52] that you could possibly learn. What good
[1:32:54] is it going to do you? it all. He came
[1:32:57] to a point where it was all vanity.
[1:33:04] Here's the sum total of it all. Life
[1:33:06] without purpose is pointless.
[1:33:11] Listen to now. These are some
[1:33:13] individuals that are well-known
[1:33:17] psychiatrists and philosophers and
[1:33:19] everything else. And here's what they
[1:33:21] came to realize about life with all the
[1:33:25] knowledge that they could acquire and
[1:33:27] gain and everything else. You got Isaac
[1:33:30] Aszoff, a prolific science fiction
[1:33:33] writer. As far as I can see, there is no
[1:33:37] purpose to life. That's what he came to.
[1:33:40] A prolific writer.
[1:33:43] Then you got Carl Jung, a psychiatrist.
[1:33:46] I don't know what the meaning or purpose
[1:33:48] of life is, but it looks as if there was
[1:33:51] something meant by it.
[1:33:55] Albert Ellis, as far as I can tell, life
[1:33:58] has no special or intrinsic meaning or
[1:34:01] purpose.
[1:34:03] Thomas Nagel, an economist, I'm afraid
[1:34:06] the meaning of life still eludes me.
[1:34:10] It's it's any wonder then that our
[1:34:12] culture has turned its back on God
[1:34:14] because they look to these great
[1:34:16] philosophers and these these individuals
[1:34:18] that that have tried to discover the
[1:34:20] purpose of life and they found that they
[1:34:22] cannot discover anything that relates to
[1:34:27] their real genuine purpose and God's
[1:34:29] purpose in this life.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Another one says Bertrand Russell
[1:34:34] he was a philosopher and an atheist. He
[1:34:37] says unless you assume a God the
[1:34:40] question about life's purpose is
[1:34:42] meaningless.
[1:34:44] See he came to a place that you that
[1:34:46] without God there is no purpose.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; That's because he's an atheist.
[1:34:57] Sigman fraud
[1:35:00] fraud.
[1:35:02] The idea of a purpose stands or falls
[1:35:05] with the religious
[1:35:07] system.
[1:35:10] He came to a place where you know oh
[1:35:12] unless you you actually believe in a god
[1:35:15] then you can have a purpose.
[1:35:18] That is the purpose to know that there
[1:35:21] is a god.
[1:35:23] Amen. Praise God. Our society is saying
[1:35:28] if that if God does not exist then we
[1:35:32] are nothing more than an evolutionary
[1:35:34] ancient
[1:35:37] an evolutionary accident.
[1:35:41] If God did not create us then life has
[1:35:44] no meaning or purpose and that life
[1:35:46] really doesn't matter. Basically, the
[1:35:48] world's approach to life and finding
[1:35:50] purpose is bankrupt. Which is why we see
[1:35:53] so much chaos that's taking place in our
[1:35:56] churches and in our schools and in our
[1:35:59] political systems these days.
[1:36:02] Praise God.
[1:36:05] Let's go to our next scripture. We're
[1:36:07] going to wind down here now.
[1:36:10] We're going to look at
[1:36:12] Ephesians chapter 1 verses 4 to 5.
[1:36:17] according as he hath chosen us in him
[1:36:20] before the foundation of the world that
[1:36:24] we should be holy. I emphasize the word
[1:36:27] holy because I want to bring up the
[1:36:29] definition of it. And without blame
[1:36:31] before him in love, having predestinated
[1:36:34] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:36:37] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[1:36:39] good pleasure of his will.
[1:36:44] Next slide. having made known unto us
[1:36:48] the mystery of his will
[1:36:51] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:36:54] hath purposed in himself.
[1:36:58] Remember everything started in him.
[1:37:03] And when he created Adam, Adam was a
[1:37:06] reflection in the image of God.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; And within Adam was a purpose to express
[1:37:13] God.
[1:37:15] Amen. And so we need to realize that
[1:37:19] that it's his purpose now
[1:37:23] that has come down into this generation
[1:37:26] that we're living in right now, this
[1:37:28] time and season that he wants to reflect
[1:37:31] in and through our lives. that in the
[1:37:34] dispensation of the fullness of times,
[1:37:36] he might gather together in one all
[1:37:39] things in Christ, both which are in
[1:37:42] heaven and which are on earth, even in
[1:37:45] him, in whom also we have obtained an
[1:37:48] inheritance,
[1:37:50] being predestinated according to what
[1:37:53] the purpose of him who workketh all
[1:37:55] things after the counsel of his own will
[1:37:59] within the attribute of God that he's
[1:38:02] placed inside of you is his will.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; His desire for your life,
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; his purpose and his plan for your life,
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; when you receive the Holy Ghost, when we
[1:38:13] look at the word holy, go to the next
[1:38:15] slide here. I want you to see the
[1:38:16] definition in the Bible. Holy
[1:38:18] fundamentally means separated, set apart
[1:38:22] or distinct.
[1:38:24] This concept applies to God in his
[1:38:27] perfect moral purity and uniqueness from
[1:38:30] all creation and to people or things
[1:38:34] called to be holy through being set
[1:38:37] apart for God's use.
[1:38:41] that attribute that God has placed in
[1:38:43] you when when when when he's talking
[1:38:46] about giving you the Holy Ghost, he's
[1:38:49] not and when he and when you hear him
[1:38:50] say, "Be ye holy as your heavenly father
[1:38:53] is holy," he's not talking about you
[1:38:55] taking on a holiness that that is like
[1:38:58] God.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; The word means being set apart for the
[1:39:04] use of God.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And your purpose as a son or
[1:39:09] a daughter of God has a time and a
[1:39:12] season to come into full manifestation
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; where you are going to reflect what it
[1:39:17] is that God wants to accomplish in this
[1:39:20] generation.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; And this is the generation for the
[1:39:23] rapture.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; In that attribute is placed the purpose
[1:39:27] of God to set you apart from the rest of
[1:39:31] the world. That's why you go to
[1:39:33] churches, you've got you've got
[1:39:35] thousands of different denominations.
[1:39:37] They're all claiming that they receive
[1:39:39] the Holy Ghost, but they don't
[1:39:41] understand what the Holy Ghost is. They
[1:39:43] think it's a sensation. They think that
[1:39:45] it's something that comes on them and
[1:39:47] makes them speak in unknown languages.
[1:39:52] Yes, it can do all of those things, but
[1:39:55] it's not the evidence that God is with
[1:39:57] you.
[1:39:59] It's not the evidence that you are a son
[1:40:01] or a daughter of God.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; The evidence that you are a son or a
[1:40:05] daughter of God is when the Holy Ghost
[1:40:07] comes upon you
[1:40:10] and takes you out of the world. Remember
[1:40:13] we were saying earlier how when the Holy
[1:40:15] Ghost came into my life, I didn't
[1:40:18] understand what was going on, but
[1:40:20] everything around me started to fade
[1:40:22] away. Why? Because in that attribute
[1:40:26] that was in your life when God called
[1:40:28] you, there was a purpose
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; to set you aside for his use.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Not to give you a religious spirit,
[1:40:39] not to give you a spirit where you're
[1:40:41] condemning everybody. You got to receive
[1:40:43] Jesus. You're going to hell. You're this
[1:40:45] and you're that and and get you into a a
[1:40:48] state of confusion where you're where
[1:40:50] where you're causing more confusion than
[1:40:51] anything else.
[1:40:53] No, it was for you. The Holy Ghost and
[1:40:58] the spirit of God coming upon you was to
[1:41:01] bring into action
[1:41:04] the attribute purpose of God so that you
[1:41:09] could fulfill and be set aside and set
[1:41:12] apart for the use of God.
[1:41:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; That's what the Holy Ghost was given
[1:41:17] for.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. When we look back into the Old
[1:41:20] Testament, you take you take the word
[1:41:23] Holy Spirit and you take the word Holy
[1:41:25] Ghost.
[1:41:27] You will find that you will not find
[1:41:30] Holy Ghost anywhere in the Old
[1:41:32] Testament.
[1:41:34] You'll find Holy Spirit in the Old
[1:41:36] Testament. You'll find Holy Spirit in
[1:41:38] the New Testament. Holy Ghost is in the
[1:41:41] in the New Testament. And I looked it up
[1:41:43] yesterday on the on my concordance and
[1:41:45] Holy Ghost came up 89 times
[1:41:49] in the New Testament
[1:41:51] and it didn't show up anywhere in the
[1:41:53] Old Testament. Why? Because the spirit
[1:41:56] of God,
[1:41:57] it was known as the spirit of God in the
[1:42:00] Old Testament. And always the spirit of
[1:42:03] God was about God coming to man,
[1:42:06] anointing individuals
[1:42:09] in order to fulfill the purpose that he
[1:42:12] had for that individual at that time and
[1:42:15] that season.
[1:42:17] But then you'll notice that it's
[1:42:19] mentioned as Holy Ghost in the New
[1:42:21] Testament.
[1:42:23] The Holy Ghost is because it's now the
[1:42:26] it's now the person of Jesus Christ.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You'll you'll you you'll see
[1:42:32] scriptures where it says that that the
[1:42:34] Holy Ghost had not been yet given
[1:42:36] because he had not ascended yet.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; And so now we come to realize that that
[1:42:43] there was something that God was doing.
[1:42:45] Remember this is all based on God's plan
[1:42:47] that he had right from the beginning
[1:42:50] that he wanted to he wanted to dwell in
[1:42:53] man. He wanted to have possession of
[1:42:56] man. He wanted to rule
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; and reign with his family here on the
[1:43:01] earth.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; But there was a process by which he
[1:43:04] would bring his word.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, the spirit of God
[1:43:08] would come upon the prophets.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; They would prophesy. They would speak
[1:43:13] things. They would know things because
[1:43:15] God was anointing them with the ability
[1:43:18] of the of the discerning and the ability
[1:43:20] to open the word and and unveil the word
[1:43:23] to the people of that particular age to
[1:43:27] draw them to the attention of what God's
[1:43:29] purpose was in that time.
[1:43:34] Well, here we are now
[1:43:36] and we're living in a day where people
[1:43:38] are all talking about, you know, have
[1:43:40] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:43:42] believed?
[1:43:43] And a lot of people don't understand
[1:43:45] what it what the Holy Ghost actually is.
[1:43:49] The Holy Ghost is not something that's
[1:43:52] that that's about sensations and
[1:43:54] speaking in tongues and and and
[1:43:56] prophesying. It's about God coming to
[1:43:59] you individually as a as a as an
[1:44:02] individual and opening your
[1:44:04] understanding to to his purpose for your
[1:44:08] life.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Being set apart for his purpose.
[1:44:17] Let's go to the next scripture.
[1:44:20] And we know that all things work
[1:44:21] together for good to them that love God,
[1:44:24] to whom whom uh to to who are called
[1:44:27] according to his purpose.
[1:44:30] everything that's going on in your life,
[1:44:32] every circumstance
[1:44:34] that when you come into a a a
[1:44:37] recognition of who you are as a son or a
[1:44:39] daughter of God, regardless of the
[1:44:42] things that you've gone through, what
[1:44:43] you've come through, what you're what
[1:44:45] you're dealing with right now, let me
[1:44:48] tell you, if if the if you've been
[1:44:50] awakened
[1:44:52] to God's purpose in your personal life,
[1:44:55] you will look at every single thing and
[1:44:57] know that it's working for good.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; It's coming for a purpose to bring you
[1:45:02] into your position so that you can
[1:45:04] fulfill the portion of the word that's
[1:45:07] going to bring the rapture in this
[1:45:10] dispensation.
[1:45:12] For whom he did forno, he also did
[1:45:15] predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:45:17] image of his son that he might be the
[1:45:19] firstborn among many brethren. Moreover,
[1:45:22] whom he did predestinate them, he also
[1:45:24] called. In whom he called them, he also
[1:45:27] justified. in whom he justified them, he
[1:45:29] also glorified. Listen, everything that
[1:45:32] you have need of is already in you.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; You've been justified. You've been you
[1:45:38] you everything that God knew you would
[1:45:40] require in this day in order to fulfill
[1:45:43] his purpose, he placed it inside of you.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; It must come to the surface. It must
[1:45:50] override the situations in your life. It
[1:45:53] must override even your mistakes.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. all the things that you that you
[1:45:58] struggle with in your life right now and
[1:46:01] you're wondering why am I not, you know,
[1:46:03] why why why am I not, you know,
[1:46:05] fulfilled? Why am I not feeling the
[1:46:07] peace of God? Why am I not feeling the
[1:46:09] liberty that I should as a son or a
[1:46:12] daughter of God? It's because you
[1:46:14] haven't fully discovered why God gave
[1:46:16] you the Holy Ghost. He didn't give you
[1:46:19] the Holy Ghost to come and sit in a
[1:46:21] church and just be a church member and
[1:46:23] and be on one of the committees. He gave
[1:46:26] you the Holy Ghost so that you could
[1:46:28] fulfill his purpose. And you knowing
[1:46:30] that and having a revelation of that
[1:46:32] gives you perfect faith to change your
[1:46:35] body
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; to move you out of this dimension to
[1:46:38] give you the faith that you need for
[1:46:40] this body to be changed.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to happen because of some
[1:46:45] scientific understanding. It's going to
[1:46:48] happen because the word said so.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; Because the word is is purpose. His
[1:46:54] purpose is in the word and nothing can
[1:46:57] change what God has purposed within his
[1:46:59] word.
[1:47:03] Romans,
[1:47:05] he's already done those things. Now
[1:47:06] look, let's read on.
[1:47:10] Who shall separate us from the love of
[1:47:13] Christ? Who shall separate us from his
[1:47:16] purpose?
[1:47:19] There's nothing that can separate you
[1:47:20] from God's purpose.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; I'm trusting I'm speaking to some people
[1:47:24] here this morning that maybe there's s
[1:47:27] there's sin, you know, knocking at their
[1:47:31] doors.
[1:47:33] There's there's situations that are that
[1:47:35] are that are holding them back, making
[1:47:37] them feel like they like they like they
[1:47:39] can't fulfill God's purpose. They it's
[1:47:42] not clear in their minds what it is that
[1:47:44] that God because because I've got too
[1:47:46] many things. I've made too many
[1:47:47] mistakes.
[1:47:49] Shall tribulation or distress or
[1:47:52] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:47:55] peril or sword separate us from the love
[1:47:58] of God?
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; You know what his love for you is,
[1:48:00] right? His purpose for you.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Nay, in all these things we are what?
[1:48:06] More than conquerors through him that
[1:48:08] loved us. Amen.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; For I am persuaded that neither death
[1:48:12] nor life, nor angels, nor
[1:48:14] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[1:48:17] present, nor things to come. Listen, I
[1:48:19] don't care what's going to come into
[1:48:21] your life. If you've come into God's
[1:48:23] purpose, you know where you stand this
[1:48:24] morning.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; You know that that nothing can come into
[1:48:28] my life that it's not going to work for
[1:48:30] good.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; I've I've got an absolute this morning.
[1:48:33] I know that the word is a reality in my
[1:48:35] life. There's nothing that's going to
[1:48:37] get me looking left, right, or center.
[1:48:39] No power, no principality. Oh, demons
[1:48:42] are going to come and get you. They're
[1:48:43] going to get you in your sleep. Oh, I
[1:48:45] had a dream last night that a demon
[1:48:46] attacked me. Oh, I'm I I probably under
[1:48:49] attack. Oh, I better watch out. There's
[1:48:51] something going to come. Oh, there's a
[1:48:53] blow coming my way. What is that? That's
[1:48:55] all fear.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; It's all fear. You cannot allow fear to
[1:49:00] control a son or a daughter of God. Not
[1:49:03] in this hour. Amen.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Not when you've been anointed with the
[1:49:06] purpose of God. It'll override those
[1:49:08] things.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Look what he says here. He says, he
[1:49:12] says, "Nor height, nor depth, nor any
[1:49:14] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:49:18] from the love of God, which is where?
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; In the anointed body of Jesus Christ our
[1:49:25] Lord."
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Nothing can separate us.
[1:49:32] Let's read let's read this uh quote
[1:49:34] here. Listen to brother Brandham.
[1:49:36] Perfect strength by perfect weakness. He
[1:49:38] says, 'Now we are very grateful that we
[1:49:40] still have a kind heavenly father who
[1:49:43] looks over our mistakes.
[1:49:46] Thank you Lord. And doesn't reckon them
[1:49:49] to us. I was reading over in the book of
[1:49:51] Romans the 4th chapter where Paul wrote
[1:49:54] the divine commentary on the life of
[1:49:57] Abraham. Now, we know that Abraham many
[1:50:00] times got kind of flustered like we do.
[1:50:03] But when but when his commentary was
[1:50:05] written, there wasn't any of his
[1:50:08] frustrations mentioned.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You see, never mentioned
[1:50:12] them at all. Said Abraham staggered not
[1:50:17] at the promises of God through unbelief,
[1:50:20] but was strong giving praise to God.
[1:50:23] See, and that's the way I hope mine will
[1:50:26] be wrote down in there. It's not my
[1:50:28] mistakes and everything, but just what I
[1:50:31] try to do, the intention of my heart to
[1:50:34] do for God's people.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:40] That's that's the kind of purpose that
[1:50:43] God has placed within us that it
[1:50:45] overrides our mistakes. It overrides the
[1:50:48] things that we think have control over
[1:50:50] our lives. But here, go next slide.
[1:50:54] We're winding down here a few more
[1:50:55] minutes. That's the reason our sins
[1:50:57] today would be every No, sorry,
[1:51:03] John. I I hit the thing twice. Ye have
[1:51:06] not chosen me. Okay, let's let's let's
[1:51:09] make this clear. Jesus is making it very
[1:51:12] clear here that you don't choose me. I
[1:51:17] choose you.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; I choose you. I choose you
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; for a purpose.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; I got a purpose to to fulfill in your
[1:51:26] life that's going to override your
[1:51:28] entire life. I don't care where you came
[1:51:30] from, what situation you're in right
[1:51:33] now. I don't care where you think you've
[1:51:35] been, where you think you you think, oh,
[1:51:37] that's too deep. That's that's I've gone
[1:51:40] too far. I've gone too far. I can never
[1:51:42] come back to God. Never mind. I have
[1:51:45] chosen you. you I but I chose you and I
[1:51:48] ordained you that ye should go and bring
[1:51:51] forth fruit.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Not only he's going to call you with his
[1:51:55] purpose, but you're going to bring forth
[1:51:56] a manifestation
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; of his word, his purpose that your fruit
[1:52:02] will remain. It's not going to be
[1:52:04] something that you're going to that
[1:52:06] you're going to come to church and
[1:52:07] you're going to last for a year or two.
[1:52:09] No, no, no, no. You're going to remain.
[1:52:11] You might go through some battles. You
[1:52:13] might go through some situations, but
[1:52:15] the purpose in my attribute that I've
[1:52:18] placed in you, it will not return unto
[1:52:20] me void.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; It will accomplish that whatsoever ye
[1:52:24] shall ask of the father in my name, he
[1:52:27] may give it you. Go to the next slide.
[1:52:29] He says here in a testimony upon the
[1:52:31] sea, that's the reason our sins today
[1:52:34] would be everyone condemned. We'd all be
[1:52:37] condemned if we look at all our sin. But
[1:52:39] God can't take us because because he
[1:52:42] does. He hurts Christ.
[1:52:45] Imagine we're part of him.
[1:52:49] We're the bride. Don't you see? So there
[1:52:51] it is. So grace, I love this statement.
[1:52:54] So grace holds us in our mistakes until
[1:52:59] we see better.
[1:53:01] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Listen,
[1:53:04] sometimes you can get blinded by the
[1:53:06] light. You can get blinded by the by the
[1:53:09] you know by by by the trial by the
[1:53:11] situation that you're dealing with. You
[1:53:13] can get to a place where you know you
[1:53:15] know I got deceived. I fell into sin.
[1:53:18] This situation happened. I couldn't
[1:53:20] control myself. Listen, you are being
[1:53:22] held by grace because God's purpose
[1:53:26] cannot return void. It has to come to
[1:53:28] him. It has to accomplish his purpose
[1:53:31] and his plan. Amen. And he says, "I'm so
[1:53:33] thankful for that." Amen. Praise God.
[1:53:36] Let the musicians come. I want to read
[1:53:38] this. I was really blessed when I read
[1:53:41] this in questions and answers. Here's
[1:53:44] somebody now that's coming to brother
[1:53:45] Brandham with a question. He says, "I
[1:53:47] lived many years in sin until I found
[1:53:49] the Lord. Please, Brother Brandham, I
[1:53:52] have sinned again and I am not worthy to
[1:53:54] come before you in this holy place.
[1:53:57] Please tell me if I can be restored holy
[1:53:59] again. Please help me, brother Brandham.
[1:54:02] I have a I have a devil in me."
[1:54:04] You know people can get you know like
[1:54:07] this person is being sincere. Help me.
[1:54:10] Will you lay your hands upon me and
[1:54:12] restore me again?
[1:54:15] And brother Ram says now there is a
[1:54:17] question. I never noticed it when I read
[1:54:19] it a while ago. There is a question now
[1:54:22] that the person and now if the person is
[1:54:25] present now here he goes on. Next slide.
[1:54:28] He says let me just read it to you. I
[1:54:30] have lived many years in sin until I
[1:54:33] found the Lord. Please, brother
[1:54:34] Brandham, see I have sinned again and
[1:54:37] I'm not worthy to come before you in
[1:54:39] this holy place. Please tell me if I can
[1:54:42] be restored whole again. Listen to what
[1:54:44] he says. Yes,
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; you have not sinned, my friend.
[1:54:53] Why could he say that?
[1:54:57] You got to you got to get the thought
[1:54:58] behind what he's saying here, okay? He
[1:55:01] says you you never he says uh
[1:55:08] please tell me okay so far he says yes
[1:55:11] you have not sinned my friend so far in
[1:55:14] God you have not you have not sinned my
[1:55:17] friend so far in God but what you could
[1:55:19] be restored in other words you could
[1:55:22] never sin too much
[1:55:25] as a son or a daughter of God I'm not
[1:55:28] saying go out and sin here let's get
[1:55:30] this clear here. I'm talking to people
[1:55:32] that are that are in that condition
[1:55:34] right now that are in a they they may
[1:55:36] find themselves in a circumstance and
[1:55:38] you know, we're looking for that last
[1:55:40] one. Okay, saints.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; We we got to get this word out to the
[1:55:43] people. We got to let them know that
[1:55:44] there's a way back. Amen. Because if
[1:55:47] there's representation in there, they're
[1:55:49] going to hear this word and there and
[1:55:51] something's going to awaken just like it
[1:55:53] happened to you, just like it happened
[1:55:54] to me.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Okay? I wasn't expecting it to happen
[1:55:57] the day that brother Gabriel, you know,
[1:55:59] finally picked me up and brought me into
[1:56:00] the house of the Lord. I had no idea.
[1:56:03] And my life was was was a mess.
[1:56:07] But when he wants to call, you can't go
[1:56:11] too deep into sin.
[1:56:15] Hallelujah. He says, see, but as long as
[1:56:17] there is something dealing with your
[1:56:19] heart, you're still in line of
[1:56:22] restoration.
[1:56:23] Guilty of the least is guilty of the
[1:56:25] whole.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; I have sinned many times every day.
[1:56:29] Every one of us do things that we don't
[1:56:32] want to do. But that attribute in you
[1:56:36] cannot fail.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God, Lord.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; I'm going to end it with this
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; psalm. It says, "The steps of a good man
[1:56:50] are ordered by the Lord."
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; And he delightth in his ways, though he
[1:56:57] fall.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; You know that God still delights in your
[1:57:00] ways, though you fall. Though you make
[1:57:02] mistakes,
[1:57:04] God delights in you because he's
[1:57:07] purposed himself in you.
[1:57:11] He's placed himself in you.
[1:57:15] He shall not be utterly cast down, for
[1:57:18] the Lord upholdeth him with his hand. I
[1:57:21] have been young and now am old, yet have
[1:57:26] I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor
[1:57:29] his seed begging bread.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Saints, you can never get away from
[1:57:34] God's purpose in your life.
[1:57:39] Regardless of your situation, regardless
[1:57:41] of your mistakes, regardless of your
[1:57:43] thoughts, regardless of your upbringing,
[1:57:46] regardless of the mess that maybe is
[1:57:49] happened within your mind, young people,
[1:57:51] you know, uh even young people that have
[1:57:53] been brought up into this message, not
[1:57:55] understanding the real purpose of the
[1:57:58] Holy Ghost, which is to awaken within
[1:58:01] you God's purpose for your life, to
[1:58:05] fulfill his plan,
[1:58:08] his desire for you. That's what we want
[1:58:12] to recognize, his life, his purpose, so
[1:58:16] that we can live it. Amen.
[1:58:20] Praise God. Let's sing that song. Create
[1:58:22] in me a clean heart. David, you know,
[1:58:25] David cried out.
[1:58:28] David had the Holy Spirit, but he didn't
[1:58:30] have it in the way that we're receiving
[1:58:31] it now. Did you know that? He had the
[1:58:34] anointing of the Holy Spirit on his
[1:58:36] life. That's why when he sang this song,
[1:58:39] he sang it. He says, "Take not thine
[1:58:42] Holy Spirit away from me." Because the
[1:58:46] Holy Spirit, we need the Holy Ghost.
[1:58:49] Because the Holy Ghost is what gives us
[1:58:51] the ability to overcome this dimension.
[1:58:55] The Holy Spirit, the the Holy Ghost is
[1:58:57] is God himself. When you receive that,
[1:59:00] that can never go to that that portion
[1:59:03] of him in you can never go to hell.
[1:59:06] If he's in you, that's why he says on
[1:59:08] that day ye shall know that I am in the
[1:59:11] father. He in me and I in you. You hear
[1:59:14] the scripture. It says Christ in you
[1:59:17] your hope of glory.
[1:59:19] What is it? It's him in us.
[1:59:24] Create
[1:59:26] in me a clean
[1:59:30] heart.
[1:59:33] Oh
[1:59:35] God,
[1:59:39] and renew a right spirit
[1:59:43] within
[1:59:45] me. This is something that you can
[1:59:48] desire. Create in me a clean heart.
[1:59:51] Create
[1:59:53] in me a clean
[1:59:56] heart.
[1:59:57] [Music]
[2:00:00] Oh
[2:00:02] God,
[2:00:06] and renew right spirit
[2:00:10] within
[2:00:12] me.
[2:00:18] Oh, cast me now away
[2:00:23] from thy presence,
[2:00:27] oh my Lord,
[2:00:30] and take.
[2:00:33] That's the joy
[2:00:35] of my salvation.
[2:00:38] Your spirit is the joy of my salvation.
[2:00:40] Lord, created me. Restore
[2:00:47] to me
[2:00:49] the joy, the joy of thy salvation
[2:00:57] and renew my spirit
[2:01:02] within me.
[2:01:05] [Music]
[2:01:09] Let's pray. Heavenly Father,
[2:01:14] I know there's a lot said here today,
[2:01:16] Lord. I
[2:01:19] don't even
[2:01:20] I know that Lord, I I did my best. Lord,
[2:01:24] I I just I bring the word in the way
[2:01:27] that I see the word and the best that I
[2:01:28] can possibly convey. Father, this word
[2:01:33] of life that burns within our hearts, oh
[2:01:35] God, burns within my heart, Lord, it'll
[2:01:38] take you now, Lord, to to go into every
[2:01:41] heart and every life and get them, Lord,
[2:01:44] to the attention of your purpose.
[2:01:47] [Music]
[2:01:48] A real desire for your purpose,
[2:01:52] which is the Holy Ghost in this day and
[2:01:54] in this hour. That is your purpose to
[2:01:57] recognize the word for our day.
[2:02:01] Lord God, may your spirit go out into
[2:02:04] every heart and every life this week
[2:02:06] after this word has been spoken. Lord,
[2:02:08] may things be brought to our
[2:02:10] remembrance, Father. that there's
[2:02:12] nothing that that can override your
[2:02:15] purpose. While we face situations and
[2:02:18] circumstances and Lord, having to go to
[2:02:21] work and maybe deal with a person that
[2:02:23] that that really gets on our nerves.
[2:02:25] Lord, may we just look and remember that
[2:02:28] this is working for good. This is
[2:02:30] working your purpose in my life. This is
[2:02:33] going to bring to pass what what what
[2:02:36] has been promised, Lord, according to
[2:02:38] your word in this hour. that there's
[2:02:40] going to be a church without spot,
[2:02:42] without wrinkle that's going to stand on
[2:02:44] the word of God. That's going to be
[2:02:46] changed in a moment and in the twinkling
[2:02:48] of an eye. Lord, that is going to be the
[2:02:50] reward of the church in this
[2:02:52] dispensation. Father, that they're not
[2:02:55] going to have to be drawn into the into
[2:02:57] the tribulation that this world is right
[2:02:59] now, Lord. Even right now, you don't
[2:03:01] have to be a genius to figure that out,
[2:03:04] Lord. All we have to do is look and you
[2:03:06] know read the newspapers and listen to
[2:03:07] the news and hear how this world is
[2:03:10] completely collapsing around us where
[2:03:13] systems are falling apart now the people
[2:03:15] are falling into financial difficulty
[2:03:18] like never before. Lord I'm seeing it in
[2:03:20] the real estate markets and in the uh in
[2:03:22] many areas father where where there's
[2:03:25] distress in the hearts of the people
[2:03:27] father they don't know where to turn.
[2:03:29] They're looking to the government. They
[2:03:31] can't find an answer. They're looking to
[2:03:33] their friends. They can't find an
[2:03:35] answer, Lord. But you are the answer.
[2:03:38] You are the purpose. You are the plan.
[2:03:41] You are the desire that that that can be
[2:03:43] placed into the hearts of the people
[2:03:45] that can change their lives and give
[2:03:47] them a future, Lord, where they can be
[2:03:49] happy, they can be joyful, they can they
[2:03:51] can have an effect. Lord, place place a
[2:03:54] a spirit of of of uh of testimony upon
[2:03:58] our lives that we can share these
[2:04:00] testimonies. Lord, we should be able to
[2:04:02] share with the people the joy of our
[2:04:06] salvation. We should be able to share
[2:04:08] with the people how how glorious it is
[2:04:12] to serve you, Father. That it is that
[2:04:14] it's good to be a Christian. That it's
[2:04:16] good to serve the living God. That
[2:04:18] there's that there is a future in
[2:04:20] serving the living God. Even our young
[2:04:22] people, Father, they need to know that
[2:04:24] there's that there's a a life that they
[2:04:28] can live, that they can have a real
[2:04:30] genuine, happy life as a young person
[2:04:33] here on this earth. They can even get
[2:04:35] married. They can have children. But
[2:04:38] Lord, they need to find your purpose in
[2:04:41] their lives first and then everything
[2:04:43] else will follow. Yes, Lord.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; I believe that with all of my heart.
[2:04:48] Lord, may this weekend that's coming,
[2:04:50] Father, these upcoming meetings, may
[2:04:53] there be such an outpouring of your
[2:04:56] purpose
[2:04:57] into the hearts of the young people that
[2:05:01] they will desire you, Lord, the person
[2:05:05] of the Holy Ghost.
[2:05:08] Not a sensation,
[2:05:11] not some vision or some dream, but the
[2:05:15] person.
[2:05:16] Lord, you come into their hearts. You
[2:05:18] come into their lives. You make yourself
[2:05:21] real to the individual. It'll change
[2:05:23] their lives. It'll they'll never be the
[2:05:26] same again. Father, that's what we
[2:05:28] desire for our children, for our young
[2:05:30] people. Father, Lord, help each and
[2:05:33] every one of us this week to fall into
[2:05:35] our duty, fall into our position, be
[2:05:38] ready, willing, desiring uh to have a
[2:05:41] passion to serve the body of Jesus
[2:05:44] Christ. This is the the message of the
[2:05:47] hour, Lord. To serve one another, to
[2:05:50] edify one another, to nourish one
[2:05:52] another by the word of God. To testify
[2:05:55] to to our friends, to our family
[2:05:57] members, to our uh to even those that we
[2:06:00] that we cross paths with. Lord,
[2:06:03] sometimes it just a person comes into
[2:06:05] our life and they're in need. Father,
[2:06:07] may we let them know that you're a
[2:06:09] living God that's present
[2:06:12] and let us have the testimony of Jesus
[2:06:15] Christ upon our lips. Granted, Father,
[2:06:18] this is our desire, Lord.
[2:06:22] We commit
[2:06:24] ourselves to your service.
[2:06:29] Lord, may you just bless,
[2:06:31] prosper,
[2:06:33] strengthen each and every heart here
[2:06:35] today. Lord, may they go out and live
[2:06:38] your purpose in their lives. Grant it.
[2:06:42] We pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
