[23:14] want to title my message blessings in
[23:18] disgu blessings in
[23:22] disgu you see we are living a time when
[23:26] Christianity has been hybridized
[23:29] Christianity has been
[23:31] modernized amen we have a modern version
[23:35] of Christianity and we have the
[23:37] hybridized version of
[23:39] Christianity but Christianity is an
[23:42] oldtime
[23:44] religion Hallelujah the gospel is not as
[23:48] sweet as the world sells
[23:51] it amen and amen I want to read my first
[23:54] quote from the message the acts of the
[23:57] Holy Spirit
[23:59] acts of the Holy Spirit
[24:01] 5429
[24:03] a brother Abraham says times may be
[24:08] hard God has not promised a flowery Beed
[24:12] of East but he has promised Grace for
[24:16] every trial that can hit
[24:18] you
[24:20] amen times may be
[24:23] hard so if today this world or this
[24:27] country is uh going through hard
[24:29] times we must not be
[24:32] surprised because the Bible says perous
[24:35] times shall
[24:36] come amen perous times shall come time
[24:42] may be
[24:43] hard but God has not and never promised
[24:47] us a flowery bird of
[24:50] ease amen but he promised great
[24:55] sufficient for every trial that will hit
[24:59] you is that not beautiful that every Tri
[25:03] that will hit you God has equivalence of
[25:06] sufficient
[25:07] Grace amen and amen he said that's right
[25:11] yes indeed grace is sufficient he said
[25:14] now he is not he's on a flower flower
[25:17] bed of East but he promised Grace to
[25:21] overcome in every
[25:23] Temptation when the cross gets heavy
[25:27] Christ promise prise to be with
[25:29] you you didn't hear
[25:32] that when the cross get heavy Christ
[25:36] promise to be with
[25:37] you the scriptures we read are four
[25:42] says every son that comes to God every
[25:47] daughter that comes to God must be
[25:52] scorched must be
[25:54] chastised not because he hates you but
[25:58] because he loves you yes in Revelation
[26:02] 3:21 said those that I love I rebuke and
[26:07] I
[26:08] chastise not those he hates but those
[26:11] that He Love yes
[26:13] sir Christianity has been sold as if
[26:16] when you come to Christ then everything
[26:19] goes well for
[26:21] you let's see from the true Easter seal
[26:24] that was preached in
[26:26] 61042 paragraph
[26:28] 79 the prophet of God said the Christian
[26:31] doesn't ask for easy
[26:35] things he said there is so much promises
[26:38] today made among Christian people so
[26:42] many
[26:43] ministers promise a people a false
[26:48] thing and what is that false thing that
[26:52] first thing is what have kept the
[26:54] denomination busy with people fill with
[26:57] members all the time because of that
[26:59] false thing they are hanging on and what
[27:01] is that false thing if you just come to
[27:04] Christ all your troubles is
[27:09] settled oh Lord have
[27:12] mercy the prophet that I tell you when
[27:15] you come to Christ then they
[27:19] begin see that is the difference between
[27:22] the modern Christianity and the old time
[27:25] religion because the old time religion
[27:28] we have been made known and aware that
[27:32] every son that comes to God must be
[27:34] tested and
[27:36] tried oh
[27:38] Hallelujah he said when you come to
[27:40] Christ then they begin that's when you
[27:43] put on a
[27:45] uniform and take a gun and enter into
[27:51] Battlefield Christianity is not a
[27:55] picnic Christianity is a war is a
[27:59] spiritual
[28:01] warfare Christianity is a
[28:03] battlefield it's a battle between right
[28:06] and wrong it's a battle between
[28:09] immorality
[28:10] immorality it's a battle between Christ
[28:13] and the devil it is a battle between
[28:15] Creed and dogmas it's a battle between
[28:19] Christ and the
[28:21] world
[28:23] Hallelujah he said the Christian road is
[28:27] not a flly flower bed of
[28:30] ease is a battle from the very hour you
[28:34] start until you are your spirit is set
[28:38] free by death you are not on a no picnic
[28:42] you are on a
[28:43] Battleground and so we are promised
[28:47] things so even in the service we are on
[28:51] the
[28:52] battlefield the holy spirit is
[28:54] ministering to you the devil is also
[28:56] whispering to you
[28:58] are you going to believe by faith or you
[29:00] are going to doubt the word the battle
[29:03] is ranging
[29:04] on oh glory be to God but as for me I
[29:09] will receive what the Lord have for me
[29:11] tonight I will open my heart and my mind
[29:14] in my hands to receive the fullness of
[29:16] the blessings of God in my life
[29:19] tonight blessed be the name of the
[29:22] Lord let us read from the book of Romans
[29:25] 8:28 another popular scripture
[29:29] here we are all very much acquainted
[29:33] with Romans chapter 8 ver
[29:36] 28 the Bible says
[29:40] here and we know that all things
[29:45] work all things work together for good
[29:48] to them that love
[29:51] God when the scripture says all things
[29:55] it means all things am Hallelujah the
[30:00] scripture didn't say some things but all
[30:03] things so all things means all
[30:07] things all things work together for your
[30:12] good to them that love God not them that
[30:17] God hate not them that hate God but them
[30:21] that love God all things work together
[30:24] for their good to them who are called
[30:27] according to his purpose Hallelujah for
[30:31] whom he did
[30:34] forn he also did
[30:36] predestinate to be conformed to the
[30:39] image of his son that he might be the
[30:41] firstborn among many
[30:44] Brethren Christianity is by
[30:50] predestination you are not a Christian
[30:52] by your will you are not your Christian
[30:56] by your desire
[30:59] we are saved by the desire of
[31:01] God God forew you before the foundation
[31:05] of the
[31:06] world and he did predestinated you in
[31:11] other words he pre plan your
[31:14] life because he is an infinite God that
[31:18] knows the end from the beginning and the

[32:50] that SP not his own son but delivered
[32:52] him up for us all how shall he not with
[32:55] him also freely give us all things
[32:58] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[33:00] God's elect it is God that justify who
[33:04] is either that condemn it it is Christ
[33:07] that died oh

[33:13] accusers oh glory be to God it is Christ
[33:18] that

[33:29] who shall separate us from the love of
[33:33] Christ oh blessed be the name of the
[33:35] Lord shall tribulation or distress or
[33:40] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[33:44] Peril or
[33:46] S
[33:48] Hallelujah he says here as is written
[33:50] for thy sake we are killed all day long
[33:53] we are accounted as sheep for the
[33:56] slaughter nay in all these things we are
[34:00] more than
[34:02] conquerors through him that love
[34:05] us
[34:07] hallelujah oh thank you Lord for I am
[34:10] persuaded that neither death nor life
[34:13] nor angels nor principalities nor powers
[34:17] nor things presentence nor things to
[34:19] come oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[34:22] nor height oh nor depth nor any other
[34:26] creature shall be able to separate us
[34:29] from the love of God which is in Christ
[34:32] Jesus our
[34:36] lord why am I reading
[34:39] this the world is selling Christ that
[34:42] when you come to church when you come to
[34:44] Christ and All Things become cool and
[34:47] soft and coozy so when you come to
[34:49] Christ with such expectation that you
[34:51] don't have what you expect because of
[34:54] what you have heard then you are
[34:56] disappointed
[34:58] so people's laugh of God cools down when
[35:02] they are naked we have no place to sleep
[35:05] when they are having famine when all
[35:08] those things the LA begin to cool
[35:11] because they come with such
[35:13] expectation but we are more than
[35:16] conquerors through him that love us
[35:20] hallelujah in all these things we are
[35:22] more than conquerors if you catch such a
[35:25] revelation you will be persu worded also
[35:29] that neither death or life nor angels or
[35:33] principalities nor height or death
[35:36] nothing present or nothing in the future
[35:39] can separate us from the love of
[35:43] God which is in Christ
[35:46] Jesus I want to read from the message in
[35:48] 19 time and sign paragraph
[35:52] 17 but Abraham says some people tries to
[35:56] introduce Christianity that you are free
[35:58] from
[36:00] worry you are free from worry nothing
[36:03] bothers you he said no you are
[36:07] not you are free from tension he said oh
[36:11] no you are tension when you become a
[36:16] Christian every brother came to the
[36:18] prophet oh brother Abraham pray for me I
[36:20] have a high temper so that God will take
[36:22] it away so no problem as you know that
[36:25] the prophet begin to pray God let people
[36:27] Cur him Lord drink troubles his way said
[36:29] no no no brother I mean pray that God
[36:31] will take away my temper he said you
[36:35] know what if God don't bring those
[36:37] things your way how will you know the
[36:39] prayers have been
[36:40] answered so God bring all those things
[36:43] and when you are able to stand without
[36:45] reacting then you know something has
[36:48] happened unto you that you know a work
[36:50] has been done on you blessed be the name
[36:53] of the Lord you are not free from
[36:55] tension oh no you attention when you
[36:59] become a
[37:02] Christian he said because he was kind of
[37:04] slow Go Happy Lucky whatever it was out
[37:08] there not caring what you
[37:10] did but when you become a real
[37:14] Christian every moment you are
[37:18] wondering am I pleasing my
[37:21] Lord the people of the world don't ask
[37:24] such a question they are question is am
[37:26] I pleasing the
[37:28] world but a Christian asks a question am
[37:31] I pleasing my
[37:33] Lord so it's not about yourself but
[37:36] about the Lord our Prophet taught us you
[37:40] don't leave for
[37:42] ourself is said first you leave for the
[37:45] Lord second you leave for your family
[37:48] before third you leave for
[37:51] yourself Hallelujah but people today are
[37:55] more careful and concerned what they
[37:57] well thinks about them more than what
[38:01] the Lord thinks about them but when you
[38:03] become a real
[38:06] Christian then you think of what the
[38:09] Lord thinks about you he said every
[38:12] woman you are wondering am I pleasing my
[38:14] Lord if I could hear from him he said he
[38:18] puts you on tension put you on God
[38:22] that's what makes you what you are
[38:26] Hallelujah so after all tension is a
[38:30] blessing it was tension that pushed Mary
[38:35] to go to where Jesus will be giv birth
[38:38] to fulfill the
[38:40] law if it was not tension that said
[38:43] everybody go to your hometown there is
[38:46] going to be a population sensous they
[38:48] will not have
[38:49] moved Jesus will be born where it was
[38:52] not prophesied so tension drove them out
[38:55] you can imagine a pregnant woman
[38:58] on the ass of the O pushing up and down
[39:01] oh my tired no in want to receive them
[39:05] yes he cannot be born in the hospital if
[39:07] he's a lamb of God he must be born where
[39:09] Lambs are born it was tension that drove
[39:12] them
[39:14] there attenion is a blessing it's just
[39:17] the way you are looking at it it's just
[39:20] the way you are looking at it see if you
[39:22] just look at the other side no matter
[39:24] how thin you slice anything you so got
[39:27] two sides to rate you see you want to
[39:30] see both
[39:32] sides Hallelujah so I think oh my what's
[39:37] this tension if I could have been born
[39:39] without this tension well if I wouldn't
[39:44] have had this tension I wouldn't have
[39:46] been what I am I wouldn't have been a
[39:50] Christian
[39:53] perhaps it was this tension that drove
[39:56] me to Jesus
[39:58] Christ so he being a blessing to
[40:04] me sometimes God puts you in a
[40:08] situation that will drive you to
[40:11] him when things are good and coozy oh
[40:16] Lord have mercy we sometimes forget
[40:19] God David prayed they was level prayer
[40:23] say
[40:24] Lord do not let me be rich over overflow
[40:27] that I might forget you and do not let
[40:30] me be hungry that I will
[40:33] stale amen and amen that is what tension
[40:39] does in the book of Corinthians 15 you
[40:42] will see Paul the great messenger of
[40:45] God
[40:46] whose aprons and handkerchief was taken
[40:49] from him and were laid on the sick and
[40:52] they were
[40:53] healed that same powerful messenger of
[40:56] God have
[40:59] infirmity he said I've saw the Lord
[41:01] tce but the Lord did not take it away
[41:04] from
[41:04] him does it mean God does not laugh for
[41:10] hello does it mean God does not laugh
[41:13] for you still love
[41:16] him then God told him my grace is
[41:20] sufficient for
[41:23] you Hallelujah he said my grace is
[41:26] sufficient for
[41:28] you that the power of Christ May rest on
[41:32] you and said therefore I will glory in
[41:36] my infirmities that when I am weak I am
[41:41] strong oh blessed be the name of the
[41:45] Lord a prophet also had a stomach
[41:49] infirmity that comes every seven
[41:52] years God used this great man of God
[41:55] across the world seven times great
[41:57] healing campaigns discernment and
[41:59] prophecies Miracles dead being raised
[42:03] and yet God didn't take away that
[42:07] infirmity it took seven years 7 by seven
[42:11] 49
[42:13] years when he had a vision that little
[42:16] animal was coming to enter his mother
[42:18] gate and he hit the chest and fell down
[42:21] and God told him your enemy is dead but
[42:24] he suffered that infirmity every seven
[42:26] years
[42:28] for 49
[42:30] years regardless of all the healing in
[42:33] his
[42:35] ministry he didn't change his God he
[42:38] didn't make his God less a
[42:41] Healer said if I
[42:44] go and pray for thousand people and they
[42:47] all die tomorrow I'll still be praying
[42:48] for the
[42:50] sick when you pray and you are not
[42:52] healed does not mean God is not the
[42:55] Healer God still he he the
[42:58] sick you know as humans sometime we pray
[43:01] and we say oh God I pray that heal me so
[43:05] I will know you are God Lord do this for
[43:07] me so that I know you are God let me
[43:09] tell you whether God do it or he does
[43:12] not do it he is still
[43:14] God you can't time God you can't put him
[43:19] in a little match box say Lord unless
[43:22] you do this you are not
[43:25] God he will laugh at you
[43:28] because he being God is by his
[43:32] sovereignty whether he will heal you he
[43:34] will heal you by his
[43:36] will he will not heal you by your
[43:41] desire blessed be the name of the Lord
[43:44] but Abraham said God heals not to prove
[43:46] his power but God heals to keep his
[43:50] word oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[43:53] I want to read from the message perfect
[43:55] strength by Perfect weakness paragraph
[43:58] 181 he said did God feel

[44:51] sympathizing with him oh sorry oh no and
[44:56] when when when you feel that somebody is
[44:58] faing your situation it makes you feel

[46:27] shape then where he can use

[46:34] Lord let us read another scripture here
[46:37] in First
[46:39] Peter 1 Peter
[46:42] 4:12 he said
[46:44] beloved think it not strange concerning
[46:48] the fairy trial which is to try

[47:21] Christ happy are ye for the spirit of
[47:25] glory and of God God rested upon
[47:29] you on their part he is evil spoken of
[47:33] but on your part he is
[47:36] glorified but let none of you suffer as
[47:39] a murderer or as a thief or as an evil
[47:42] doer or as a busy body in other men's
[47:46] matters don't give any excuse for the
[47:50] devil I did this because of this I
[47:53] didn't come to church because of this
[47:55] this happened because of this is no s
[47:59] amen but yet if any man suffer as a
[48:03] Christian let him not be
[48:06] ashamed but let him glorify God on his
[48:11] behalf for the time is come that
[48:14] judgment must begin at the house of God
[48:18] Pastor you are judging
[48:20] me the church is
[48:23] judgmental but judgment must begin in
[48:26] the house of of God because if we are
[48:29] judged here we will not more be judged
[48:31] there that is why the bride of Christ
[48:33] will not be judged we will sit in the
[48:35] throne to judge the
[48:37] world

[52:52] work that ye may be perfect and entire
[52:55] wanting
[52:57] nothing some through the
[53:01] waters some through the floods some
[53:03] through the
[53:05] fire but all through the blood some
[53:08] through great sorrow but Jesus Lead
[53:13] along mess Jehovah jaah the prophet of

[54:18] of testing and tring I am also going
[54:20] through some kind of test or trial but
[54:22] that has not stopped me from preaching

[57:12] such as is common to
[57:15] man but God is
[57:18] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[57:22] tempted above that which ye are able
[57:27] but will with the Temptation also make a
[57:32] way of Escape that he may be able to
[57:36] Bear
[57:37] it what a
[57:39] consolation what an
[57:43] encouragement when David went to war
[57:45] with his army and they return and the
[57:48] enemy R the town the camp take away
[57:51] their women their children captive
[57:54] thinking everything
[57:57] everybody's heart was melt and sad but
[58:00] the scripture says that David encorate
[58:05] himself in the Lord is
[58:07] God we have got to come to a time that
[58:11] we have to have inner
[58:14] encouragement self
[58:16] encouragement individual
[58:19] encouragement when the pastor can
[58:21] encourage you when your brethren can
[58:23] encourage you lean on the Lord to
[58:26] encourage
[58:28] you when you lean on God for his
[58:31] encouragement you will not be
[58:33] disappointed and each and every
[58:36] individual must come to a place to know
[58:38] how to encourage yourself in the
[58:43] Lord oh help us Lord
[58:47] tonight from the church ages the prophet
[58:49] of God said
[58:50] persecutions and trials are natural
[58:56] normal part of the Christian
[58:59] Life how do you say trials and
[59:03] persecutions a normal and natural part
[59:07] of the Christian Life what do you mean
[59:10] he said there is only one thing you can
[59:12] do about them commit them all onto God
[59:18] judge not and leave their heart working
[59:22] and final judgment to him
[59:26] as humans when things happen we begin to
[59:29] say things we begin to guess things but
[59:33] no it might not be
[59:36] so when
[59:38] job was going through what he was going
[59:41] through when his friends came
[59:44] around it took about 3 days they were
[59:49] silent they did not say anything
[1:00:11] why is job was going through what he was
[1:00:13] going through on
[1:00:14] Earth little did he know God was
[1:00:19] gambling with his life above
[1:00:22] them how did it happen
[1:00:27] the devil was going through and through
[1:00:29] as his normal business then one day God
[1:00:32] told
[1:00:33] him hey devil have you considered my
[1:00:37] servant job job was de
[1:00:41] there yet God went and challenge oh Lord
[1:00:45] have
[1:00:46] mercy then the devil said of course you
[1:00:49] have blessed him what why would a man
[1:00:52] worship him if you have blessed him so
[1:00:55] in Christian we don't serve God because
[1:00:57] we have
[1:00:58] everything that is not
[1:01:01] Christianity he said no it's not so you
[1:01:04] touch him and see said are you sure but
[1:01:08] the good news is
[1:01:10] that the devil cannot do anything to you
[1:01:15] unless God permit
[1:01:18] him Hallelujah on knowing to Jo the
[1:01:22] devil told God are you not the one that
[1:01:24] have thrown a w all of fire around
[1:01:28] him meanwhile Jo might think he is
[1:01:31] nobody how you know that God a world of
[1:01:36] fire around us you might not know but
[1:01:40] God has secured us oh blessed
[1:01:46] be the prophet of God said when God is
[1:01:51] taking you to a
[1:01:52] trial it means that you are
[1:01:56] favor with
[1:01:59] God I'm going through
[1:02:02] this he
[1:02:04] says God had confidence in
[1:02:08] job knowing that job will not disappoint
[1:02:13] Him Sister when you are going through
[1:02:15] any kind of trial it shows God has
[1:02:18] confidence in you God knows you will not
[1:02:21] let him

[1:02:25] God in
[1:02:28] oh go and take everything you would
[1:02:30] like and of course job was not
[1:02:32] worshiping God because of what he has
[1:02:35] all his animals his cars his sheep
[1:02:37] everything was taken away and job still
[1:02:40] wakes up in the morning and say praise
[1:02:42] the
[1:02:44] Lord you can
[1:02:46] imagine what can separate us from the
[1:02:50] love of God which is in Christ
[1:02:53] Jesus sh per
[1:02:56] our nakedness our faring nothing
[1:03:00] absolutely nothing can separate us from
[1:03:03] the love of
[1:03:04] God which is in Christ
[1:03:07] Jesus went as far as taking his children
[1:03:11] taking
[1:03:13] everything God because I want to touch
[1:03:16] his body he feel how to deny you

[1:03:43] woman she can be tired cares God and
[1:03:47] die said you talking like one of those
[1:03:52] foolish and also ask the wife a question
[1:03:56] we have received good things from the

[1:06:27] from the message without money or Price
[1:06:30] 5982 paragraph
[1:06:33] 6 if we live right let care if we live
[1:06:40] right that doesn't mean that we are
[1:06:43] immune from
[1:06:46] TR just like Jo's friend were
[1:06:49] thinking because going through whatever
[1:06:52] he's going
[1:06:56] be careful of how you judge one
[1:06:58] another you are not the one
[1:07:01] who the
[1:07:06] one it to
[1:07:08] God knows what
[1:07:10] doing if we live right that doesn't mean
[1:07:13] that we are immune from
[1:07:15] troubles frankly it means that all
[1:07:19] troubles are directed our
[1:07:22] waying right
[1:07:26] for many are the afflictions of the
[1:07:28] righteous but God delivered him out all
[1:07:32] of them that's a glorious part that one
[1:07:36] is found in the book of Psalm 34 verse
[1:07:39] 19 Psalm 34:
[1:07:42] 19 many other afflictions of the
[1:07:45] righteous
[1:07:47] but that is the good
[1:07:49] news but the Lord delivered
[1:07:56] the Lord delivered him out of them
[1:08:00] all but the secret is the f are
[1:08:05] many and he is not because he's a sinner
[1:08:08] the Bible didn't say many other fles of
[1:08:11] The Sinner
[1:08:12] hello is that how it read many other
[1:08:16] affli of The Sinner no sir but many

[1:09:14] open East
[1:09:16] Africa Africa country
[1:09:22] Mal I didn't want to go because of
[1:09:24] experience I when I
[1:09:30] was I was going by
[1:09:33] land and
[1:09:35] uh when I got to malari it was only for
[1:09:38] a Transit basa to cross over to go
[1:09:42] to mosambik where my destination was and
[1:09:46] it looks like the immigration officers
[1:09:48] didn't want me to
[1:09:50] Cross they made hell out of this the The
[1:09:54] Crossing
[1:09:56] a Transit visitor a visit of two days of
[1:09:59] $50 they said it's 100 I've paid and
[1:10:03] when he brought the receipt and the
[1:10:04] stamp it was I said what about my
[1:10:06] imbalance he said no we will cancel you
[1:10:08] you will not go here so I went and I was
[1:10:11] the step and in the bus going praying to
[1:10:16] go whatever I was going I was sharing
[1:10:18] message books of course what I do
[1:10:21] whatever I go out of missions praying
[1:10:23] and
[1:10:24] singing so as I was giving my number was
[1:10:27] behind I left and 3 month ago or 3 month
[1:10:31] after us I received a message from a
[1:10:34] pastor in
[1:10:36] Malawi and he says he mentioned his name
[1:10:40] and his training and his many years in
[1:10:42] Ministry but the book I gave him he has
[1:10:45] never come across such a book before
[1:10:49] said I want you to come to malari and
[1:10:50] bring this
[1:10:52] message so I said malari again
[1:10:56] I'm not going with the immigration and
[1:10:59] all that I went
[1:11:00] through and whilst I was praying and
[1:11:04] while they were praying God was giving
[1:11:07] them Revelation upon Revelation his
[1:11:10] church members who have not seen who
[1:11:12] doesn't even know me God will give them
[1:11:13] Revelation they will describe me to
[1:11:15] their Pastor that this is the man we
[1:11:18] saw was so much that God was even giving
[1:11:21] Revelation to my mom she's in blessed
[1:11:24] memory now said my son I had a vision
[1:11:27] you were on a big platform having a
[1:11:28] crusade somewhere I said finally I canot
[1:11:33] fight God I said okay I will go and as
[1:11:35] usual I go through Kenya by flight from
[1:11:38] West Africa to East Africa then I take
[1:11:40] four days to cross by road because of
[1:11:43] the H not because I wanted that way but
[1:11:46] that is how I could be able to manage to
[1:11:48] be able to get there so when I get to
[1:11:52] the B because of the past experience so
[1:11:54] I have to to change my $50 holding me so
[1:11:58] when I got I said I'm coming for a
[1:11:59] Transit so that is my
[1:12:02] $50 the immigration officer look at me
[1:12:04] said you I know you I will not let you
[1:12:07] cross he actually took a pen and crossed
[1:12:10] my passport refuse entry unless you pay
[1:12:14] $100 Jesus you see God that is why I
[1:12:17] didn't want to come here again I didn't
[1:12:19] want to avoid all those
[1:12:21] things so I have no option I have to pay
[1:12:25] and when I got down there to chawa Below
[1:12:28] blanta in Malawi when that Pastor met me
[1:12:32] said do you know I invited you I said no
[1:12:35] he said when we were in that bus I kept
[1:12:38] hearing the voice of God telling me
[1:12:41] there is a blessing in this bus I kept
[1:12:44] looking around where is a blessing it
[1:12:46] was no long a Pentecostal preacher came
[1:12:49] to preach in the bus said I commun with
[1:12:51] my Lord and asked him is that a blessing
[1:12:54] nothing was ringing
[1:12:56] so he said you saw a little boy sitting
[1:12:58] in the entrance of the car the bar
[1:13:00] bubbling his mouth whether he's singing
[1:13:02] or praying so said when he were giving
[1:13:04] out the books said when he stretched the
[1:13:07] hand to receive that book The Voice
[1:13:10] spoke back to him this is a
[1:13:13] blessing so he asked the Lord how can
[1:13:15] this small bo be a blessing so he said
[1:13:17] because I need that blessing that is why
[1:13:20] I invited you here and I said you didn't
[1:13:23] tell me about this then I told him I am
[1:13:26] not the blessing the blessing is in
[1:13:29] those books I gave
[1:13:31] you then he look at me he said as much
[1:13:35] as you are carrying those books then you
[1:13:37] are my
[1:13:39] blessing then the scripture came back to
[1:13:42] me in Revelation 1:3 maybe we can read
[1:13:45] that as our last scripture Revelation
[1:13:47] 1:3 the Bible said blessed are
[1:13:52] those blessed is he that reth
[1:13:56] and they that hear the words of this
[1:13:59] prophecy and keep those things which are
[1:14:01] written the ring for the time is at hand
[1:14:04] that is the day understand this
[1:14:06] prophecy you organized meetings upon
[1:14:09] meetings conferences and ministers
[1:14:12] meetings 50 denomination preachers woman
[1:14:15] preachers all over after the first day
[1:14:18] meeting the one woman preacher resigned
[1:14:20] that very evening One Pastor one
[1:14:23] baptized
[1:14:25] I think if I remember we baptized about
[1:14:26] five churches during that campaign in
[1:14:29] malari and the bush begin to spread all
[1:14:34] over but yet I asked
[1:14:36] myself why was I being blocked at the
[1:14:40] border it was because of that blessing
[1:14:43] ahead but Abraham said when Satan make a
[1:14:47] big fight it is a sign to you that there
[1:14:51] is a blessing ahead
[1:14:55] that was the southern part of Malawi God
[1:14:57] brought me to muu the middle B of Mala
[1:15:01] and you baptized about five pastors also
[1:15:03] about two three years
[1:15:05] ago one of them was a a bible school
[1:15:08] scholar he said I've gone through Bible
[1:15:09] school by the message you are preaching
[1:15:10] Apostle I've never heard it before what
[1:15:12] do I do I said repent and baptized in
[1:15:14] the name of Jesus Christ and that very
[1:15:16] day he
[1:15:17] surrounded he brought the wife to the
[1:15:19] service in the evening and by the
[1:15:21] preaching of the word they testify of
[1:15:22] the service my wife was sick but the
[1:15:24] Lord healed there right down
[1:15:27] there I said why would I go to S thing
[1:15:31] at the
[1:15:33] border it was last year for the first
[1:15:36] time God gave me Grace to able to fly
[1:15:38] over from Kenya to malari and to go be
[1:15:41] the glory this year the Foreign Affairs
[1:15:44] have wiped away visa for ghans and
[1:15:47] malarian when I saw the news I said
[1:15:49] Thank You
[1:15:52] Lord so last Sunday I was preping to go
[1:15:55] and preach for Pastor John Saga my
[1:15:57] pastor the first Pastor baptized over
[1:15:59] there sent me a WhatsApp message saw
[1:16:02] baptism pictures how many were baptized
[1:16:04] he said two I said glory be to God then
[1:16:06] he said this is the result because we
[1:16:09] came to visit us in
[1:16:11] Mal and these are many other testimonies
[1:16:14] God is doing in East and Central
[1:16:18] Africa I was sharing one with Pastor in
[1:16:21] the car one of them also denomination
[1:16:25] what God deals with me he give me Grace
[1:16:27] among denominational churches and
[1:16:29] somehow somewhere they open their door
[1:16:32] and I preach the message among them and
[1:16:34] they believe an entire church and the
[1:16:36] pastors believe baptizing I give them
[1:16:38] books and when they hear it they tell
[1:16:40] the other churches and they all
[1:16:42] organized so I've lost count of the
[1:16:44] churches in Uganda in Kenya in malari
[1:16:47] and Z of but one particular one I would
[1:16:50] never forget was last year December I
[1:16:52] was in Kenya when I was preaching the
[1:16:54] goel
[1:16:55] among one denominational church with
[1:16:57] other three pastors coming to one of the
[1:17:00] pastors who came from a different church
[1:17:02] he
[1:17:10] was to
[1:17:13] the and the wife was a preacher but
[1:17:22] sheeded Church
[1:17:31] after and
[1:17:38] he saw with STS and Tre and they saw me
[1:17:44] coming with a sword I to all those STS

[1:18:50] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ oh
[1:18:53] my God
[1:18:56] so I told them that the hard message I
[1:18:59] was preaching I was apprting
[1:19:01] denominational stamps increase and I'm
[1:19:04] sowing the seeds of the message of the
[1:19:06] in your
[1:19:08] heart and God gave me Grace the existing
[1:19:11] Mage churches there the elders are doing
[1:19:13] very good work behind and they are
[1:19:16] keeping them active join join services
[1:19:18] and preaching to them and they are
[1:19:20] pleading and praying for God to give
[1:19:22] them Grace to have a place of Fellowship
[1:19:25] a structure to praise the name of the
[1:19:27] Lord the testimonies are wonderful
[1:19:30] sometimes you go far in the north part
[1:19:33] of Uganda a place called
[1:19:35] Cabo they were they are out of
[1:19:37] civilization they are not part they are
[1:19:40] C Raiders they fight to steal C from one
[1:19:43] another military are afraid to go there
[1:19:46] and the pastor didn't tell me so when I
[1:19:48] came there he said you are the second
[1:19:50] missionary to come to this place because
[1:19:52] ministers in Uganda don't want to even
[1:19:54] go there from the city because the place
[1:19:56] is
[1:19:58] dangerous we have to take bike motorbike
[1:20:01] to ride 15 miles to the Wilderness we
[1:20:03] have services on the Rocks Under the
[1:20:05] trees no chair you having good time
[1:20:09] yet we sit on the floor you preach them
[1:20:13] standing there is even no water to
[1:20:15] baptize we have to they have to get a
[1:20:17] pumping baptism pool and walk miles and
[1:20:20] fetch water and baptize them I think we
[1:20:22] baptize 22
[1:20:25] from those native lands they don't know
[1:20:27] their left or right they are living in
[1:20:29] another world all together there's
[1:20:31] nothing like Civilization they drink the
[1:20:33] blood of the cows they are warriors I
[1:20:36] was told before they come to church with
[1:20:38] guns and knife and arrows and stick all
[1:20:41] weapons but when the love of Christ
[1:20:44] enter their heart they drop all those
[1:20:46] things and come to church and praise the
[1:20:49] name of the
[1:20:50] Lord that is what the love of God can
