[21:07] we just take advantage of
[21:11] it I'm G ask you where the clock
[21:16] is
[21:24] um we're going to be talking about a
[21:26] character that is very special to me
[21:29] it's his name is
[21:34] Jesus there's one here that needs
[21:38] him or would possibly want to know him
[21:43] more then be attented to the word of
[21:47] God for me it's been of a great
[21:51] blessing I'm going to read in the book
[21:53] of
[21:55] Isaiah chapter 53
[22:02] reading verse
[22:11] three what I'm gonna be speaking this
[22:17] evening the majority of what you'll be
[22:20] hearing you'll find it in the
[22:23] message the crty of
[22:26] sin
[22:29] and the price and the penalty that had
[22:31] to be paid to read it from our
[22:35] lives scripture says like
[22:38] this
[22:55] verse he is despised and rejected of men
[22:58] a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with
[22:59] grief and we hid as it were our faces
[23:02] from him he was despised and we esteemed
[23:04] him
[23:16] not he had borne our griefs and carried
[23:19] our sorrows yet we did esteem him
[23:21] stricken smitten of God and
[23:26] afflicted
[23:38] but he was wounded for our
[23:39] transgressions he was bruised for our
[23:41] iniquities the chastisement of our peace
[23:43] was upon him and with his stripes we are
[23:54] healed all we like sheep have gone
[23:57] astray we have turned everyone to his
[23:59] own way and the Lord hath laid on him
[24:01] the iniquity of us
[24:15] Soul he was oppressed and he was
[24:17] afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he
[24:20] is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[24:22] and as the Sheep before shears is dumb
[24:25] so he open openeth not his mouth
[24:29] let us
[24:30] pray heav
[24:34] father at this hour we have read your
[24:38] word asking Lord of your
[24:42] blessing that you would go to every
[24:46] heart that would not be my words
[24:49] Lord that it would be your word
[24:51] Lord giving life
[24:55] Lord father we put ourselves in your
[24:57] hands
[25:01] expecting that your grace would accomp
[25:03] us this
[25:05] evening and we put ourselves in your
[25:08] hands in the name of our Lord Jesus
[25:10] Christ amen you may be seated
[25:14] Brothers
[25:17] um when I think about
[25:25] Jesus I believe it's the found of every
[25:29] Christian if you have
[25:32] problems just look at
[25:37] Jesus because we can learn very much
[25:39] from
[25:40] him he is the
[25:43] life
[25:47] uh so int to introduce a little bit
[25:50] about
[25:52] Jesus I'm going to go to that great
[25:56] event of the
[26:02] crucifixion and quite possibly Jesus got
[26:04] to a
[26:06] point where he had to make a
[26:12] decision just as we have to make
[26:14] decisions in our
[26:16] lives but Jesus got to a point
[26:19] [Music]
[26:21] Brothers where he began began to be in
[26:26] anguish because he he knew his hour had
[26:32] come and many times we as
[26:35] Christians we know our hour has come and
[26:40] brothers uh you get
[26:44] nervous in any circumstance
[26:48] Brothers you may possibly be a little
[26:53] fearful Jesus was in a
[26:56] moment
[26:58] a decisive moment for all
[27:01] humanity and he
[27:04] [Music]
[27:06] knew that due to this
[27:11] decision it it was not only going to
[27:13] depend on
[27:14] [Music]
[27:15] him but the the people were involved as
[27:20] well so him in these
[27:25] circumstances he went to goek for that
[27:28] place to
[27:32] pray and when he was there
[27:35] Brothers the Bible teaches
[27:40] us that he went into a profound
[27:44] prayer and in that
[27:48] prayer so many things
[27:52] happened and one of the things that
[27:53] happened there is that
[27:56] Jesus
[27:59] he wanted to abort the
[28:02] mission he said
[28:05] father if it if it were
[28:09] possible if there's somebody better than
[28:14] me let this cup pass from
[28:17] me the Bible
[28:20] says that Jesus stood
[28:23] up and he went to look at his
[28:26] disciples and he said Lord which
[28:30] one which one will take my
[28:33] place Jesus said
[28:38] no and they said he went back to
[28:41] prayer and he got up
[28:44] again and he said Lord he said father if
[28:47] it's
[28:49] possible amongst the 12 that are
[28:52] here if it were
[28:56] possible Jesus Jesus went back to prayer
[29:03] again and Jesus went back and he
[29:06] said Lord
[29:09] father may your will be
[29:15] done when Jesus was there
[29:20] Brothers he got into such a
[29:24] state that the Bible lets us know
[29:31] that he began to sweat drops of
[29:34] blood
[29:38] scientifically this process is called
[29:56] OSIS a
[30:01] condition where a person that is very
[30:04] nervous and he is
[30:10] fearful and he is he is
[30:16] scared the prophet
[30:21] says God had to let Jesus
[30:24] go to take this decision make this
[30:26] decision
[30:29] as a human
[30:32] being did you know
[30:37] Brothers there have been
[30:40] occasions where God is going to have to
[30:43] leave
[30:45] you not because God wants
[30:49] to the Bible teaches
[30:51] [Music]
[30:53] me that when the people of Israel were
[30:55] going to sacrifice the land
[31:00] they had to do it
[31:03] willfully that's why being a
[31:06] Christian it's not an
[31:10] obligation it's not CU my
[31:13] father or my mom tells
[31:18] me to be a Christian is something
[31:24] voluntary Jesus Jesus
[31:30] in such a
[31:32] condition the prophet tells
[31:35] us that that God turned his
[31:42] back Brothers in such an
[31:47] Agony and he
[31:54] praying oh and and he turned his back to
[31:56] him
[31:59] what would you do
[32:09] Brothers in
[32:13] Hebrews that although he was a
[32:17] son he had to learn
[32:25] obedience so Jesus in this uh
[32:33] condition if we uh take it to the place
[32:35] where they they they
[32:37] went the Bible teaches
[32:41] us that that uh the many soldiers had
[32:46] gone to go and and and go for one
[32:51] man we'll look at it through the
[32:56] scripture
[32:57] [Music]
[32:59] the Bible says that that Jesus's Fame
[33:01] began to go throughout
[33:04] Jerusalem there was a good
[33:07] Fame but there was also the ill
[33:12] Fame to the point where they began to
[33:17] think that that he was a he was a person
[33:20] that was a
[33:22] demonized he had he had the Devil Within
[33:25] him
[33:27] they got to think of such a
[33:31] thing that the people began to be
[33:33] fearful of
[33:37] him it seems like there's a witchcraft
[33:43] there so there was the a good
[33:46] Fame and then there was the bad fame or
[33:49] ill
[33:53] Fame like well how are we going to trap
[33:56] him
[33:58] because he has
[34:00] powers we've
[34:03] heard that he's resurrects the
[34:07] dead we've
[34:10] heard that he he walks he goes through
[34:22] walls how can we do it to to trap this
[34:25] person
[34:27] bring the best of the
[34:31] soldiers we're going to find the best
[34:36] weapons the priests came with
[34:40] them just just in case that they have to
[34:42] do a cast out some
[34:47] Demon you know Jesus already
[34:50] knew and in on that
[34:53] morning when they were going for
[34:55] Jesus
[34:59] Jesus went out to meet
[35:02] them and he
[35:04] asked uh who whom do you
[35:09] seek said they said
[35:15] Jesus and the Bible
[35:18] says that Jesus asked once
[35:21] again whom do you
[35:24] seek they said we seek Jesus
[35:28] he said he said I am
[35:33] he the Bible doesn't just say
[35:37] that it says when when he said I am
[35:40] [Music]
[35:42] he all all of the soldiers were taken
[35:46] back they all fell to the
[35:49] ground because that I
[35:52] am
[35:54] Brothers when Moses
[35:58] received the
[36:00] commission he said what do who do I tell
[36:02] them I
[36:04] am I am that I
[36:10] am there was the the main
[36:13] one great I
[36:16] am the one that
[36:19] isy God the
[36:23] Conqueror that's why when those words
[36:25] came out of
[36:30] no demon that can stand before those
[36:37] words he wanted to intended to let them
[36:39] know one
[36:42] thing that if he went to
[36:47] Calvary it wasn't because it was going
[36:49] to be something forceful
[36:51] brothers because if he was going to go
[36:53] to
[36:54] Calvary it was because of love
[37:06] Brothers if you have made the decision
[37:07] to be a
[37:09] Christian do it out of
[37:15] love when you do things out of love
[37:18] brother all of Heaven is backing you
[37:21] [Music]
[37:23] up all of the angels are at your
[37:25] disposition
[37:30] but Jesus
[37:32] brothers when they took
[37:34] him
[37:36] Brothers
[37:40] Jesus they took him and and and they
[37:42] took him and put him in a
[37:46] prison his friends had forsaken
[37:52] him if you perhaps one time have been in
[37:54] a prison or or or a place like that
[37:59] you know what it feels like to to be
[38:01] there uh it's
[38:04] lonely without
[38:07] friends but Jesus was there
[38:09] Brothers in that
[38:15] condition the Bible says
[38:20] that he he was in in
[38:23] anguish and he was afflicted
[38:28] yet he did not open his
[38:34] mouth like a lamb he was taken to the
[38:40] slaughter and and and like uh like a
[38:43] lamb was taken before the the
[38:46] shears and he opened not his
[38:50] mouth and he opened not his
[38:54] [Music]
[38:55] mouth
[38:57] Brothers sometimes we go through
[38:58] circumstances in
[39:00] [Music]
[39:03] life oh Brothers but why the brother
[39:06] this and and and not
[39:08] me why does God do this for him and not
[39:10] for
[39:15] me the Bible says that
[39:17] he he opened not his
[39:21] mouth the prophet of God tells
[39:25] us
[39:28] that Jesus could have told the disciples
[39:29] the
[39:32] future he said you know what
[39:35] Peter you're gonna go through this and
[39:37] and
[39:41] this but the prophet says that Jesus
[39:43] never told them the
[39:45] future in order to not discourage
[39:53] them because sometimes we're so worried
[39:55] we're like oh what's going to happen
[39:55] further ahead
[40:00] head and you'll find out the process
[40:03] that the disciples had to go
[40:07] through I'm go to
[40:14] one we're going to the Book of
[40:18] Psalms chapter
[40:22] 22 and David will Express to us a little
[40:24] more here
[40:27] about what happened
[40:38] there verse
[40:45] one verse one of Psalms chapter
[40:53] 22 I believe it was the spirit of God in
[40:56] David
[40:58] that's what brother BR
[41:04] said my God my God why hast Thou
[41:07] forsaken
[41:09] me do you see
[41:12] brothers that God won't always be
[41:17] there when you have to make a decision
[41:23] brothers and you feel like you've been
[41:25] you've been forsaken
[41:30] think upon the
[41:33] scure why are th so far from helping
[41:39] me and from the words of my
[41:46] roaring oh my God I cry in the daytime
[41:49] thou hearest
[41:53] not thou holy
[41:59] oh thou that inhabit the Praises
[42:01] of our fathers trusted in
[42:05] thee they trusted and thou did deliver
[42:10] them they Cried unto thee and were
[42:13] [Music]
[42:14] delivered they trusted in thee and were
[42:16] not
[42:19] confounded but I am a
[42:22] worm and no
[42:24] man a reproach of
[42:27] men and despised of the
[42:31] people all they that see me laugh me to
[42:34] scorn they shoot out the
[42:36] lips they shake the head
[42:40] saying he trusted on the
[42:42] Lord that he would deliver let him
[42:45] deliver
[42:47] him seeing he delighted in
[42:53] him but thou are he that took me out of
[42:55] the womb
[42:59] that did make me hope when I was upon my
[43:01] mother's
[43:04] breast I was a cast upon thee from the
[43:09] world Thou Art my God from
[43:12] my oh how beautiful
[43:15] Brothers when you as a
[43:18] [Music]
[43:22] Christian whether God blesses you or not
[43:26] say
[43:27] God you have set you
[43:30] have but the womb
[43:34] of God knows you
[43:37] brother he knows your
[43:40] needs but what he doesn't
[43:44] want is to put your needs
[43:47] first and then
[43:50] him it's first it's
[43:53] God and then he'll take care
[43:57] of your
[44:00] needs blessed be the name of the
[44:07] Lord be not far from
[44:10] me for trouble is
[44:14] near for there is none to
[44:18] help many bulls have compassed
[44:23] me strong BS of B have sent me
[44:30] round they gaped upon me with their
[44:32] mouths as a raving and a roaring
[44:37] lion
[44:41] Brothers when the prophet narrates
[44:45] this there are certain
[44:47] things that that that really shake you
[44:51] up because when they took Jesus to that
[44:54] place
[44:58] Jesus was in a
[45:03] condition where the Bible
[45:07] says the Bulls of Bashan have beset
[45:14] me you know the capital punishment of
[45:17] that
[45:19] time is that first that they would beat
[45:22] the
[45:24] people and then they would CR crucify
[45:31] them when they took
[45:36] Jesus and they took him there to give
[45:38] him a
[45:41] lashing those people that were were they
[45:43] whipping
[45:47] Jesus the the the story
[45:50] says that they would take
[45:54] turns because not only one person would
[45:58] die it was a certain number of
[46:03] people and when Jesus's time came
[46:09] around if one
[46:16] person died in the hands of the one that
[46:18] was punishing
[46:20] them he would get a
[46:24] reward so those
[46:28] men when they were approaching to a to
[46:31] whip a a
[46:33] man they weren't just just uh swinging
[46:38] softly no no
[46:44] brothers they knew that if the person
[46:46] died in their turn they received a
[46:51] reward so they took those
[46:54] whips the prophet Des describes
[46:57] him it it was it they were like a cat
[47:00] [Music]
[47:02] cloths they were like a the barbed
[47:06] wire and when they would hit the
[47:09] body it it would tear the flesh when he
[47:13] they
[47:14] P so those men
[47:17] brothers anointed by
[47:20] Satan they knew who was
[47:23] there they knew
[47:26] that he would
[47:28] die and Satan
[47:31] brother he wanted to finish him
[47:34] off and they started to whip
[47:37] him and the Bible
[47:40] says let us
[47:43] read I am poured out like
[47:48] water and all my bones are out of my
[47:50] joint out of
[47:53] joint my heart is like Wax
[47:58] is melted in the midst of my
[48:01] bowels could you imagine
[48:04] Brothers those
[48:06] men
[48:09] trying to whip
[48:11] Jesus with all of their
[48:15] might oh
[48:20] Brothers says my strength is dried up
[48:23] like a a pot's
[48:24] herd
[48:27] and my tongue cleaveth to my
[48:31] jaws and thou has brought me into the
[48:34] dust of
[48:37] death for dogs have compassed
[48:41] me the Assembly of the wicked have
[48:43] enclosed
[48:46] me they pierced my hands and my
[48:53] feet I may tell all my b
[48:56] bones oh
[49:00] Brothers I could imagine that those
[49:02] those cat
[49:04] claws when they would hit the
[49:09] body and they would tear the pieces of
[49:13] [Music]
[49:15] Flesh that's why the Bible says I going
[49:17] tell all my
[49:23] bones but miraculous L
[49:27] Brothers Jesus continued
[49:33] living because Satan knew that if he
[49:35] finished
[49:37] him he would not be able to carry the
[49:42] cross but
[49:45] miraculous Jesus continued
[49:51] alive and he's not dead
[49:53] Brothers he is alive
[50:05] they part my garments among
[50:08] them and cast L upon my
[50:13] V but be thou not far from me oh
[50:16] Lord oh my
[50:19] strength haste thee to help
[50:23] me deliver my soul from the
[50:27] my darling from the power of
[50:29] [Music]
[50:33] God save me from the lion's mouth for
[50:35] thou has heard me from the horns of the
[50:38] UN will declare my name unto my
[50:42] bre in the midst of the congregation
[50:45] will I praise
[50:48] thee so this is letting us know one
[50:51] thing when Jesus arrived
[50:54] there
[50:56] he didn't arrive there
[51:00] complaining although his father was not
[51:04] there there there was no answer when he
[51:08] cried
[51:10] out it's not easy
[51:15] Brothers but those were the
[51:17] circumstances Jesus found himself
[51:23] in when Jesus arrived
[51:28] they took him to the
[51:34] Cross scientifically
[51:39] Brothers body has a nerve in
[51:42] its
[51:45] feet they say that when that
[51:49] nerve they they massage it
[51:53] well you could be healed
[51:56] from any
[52:01] sickness
[52:04] medically but when Jesus arrived
[52:09] there and they placed that that uh that
[52:13] nail upon that
[52:17] nerve he
[52:21] experimented the the harshest
[52:24] pain that the human being could
[52:30] experience and with all of
[52:33] that he opened not his
[52:37] mouth he opened not his
[52:43] mouth aren't you thankful with with God
[52:45] for
[52:46] that the prophet says
[52:51] Jesus could have used his
[52:54] pow
[52:56] did you know there was a legion of
[52:57] angels
[53:00] waiting the order of
[53:05] [Music]
[53:08] Jesus any Proclamation from
[53:11] Jesus those
[53:14] [Music]
[53:16] angels were at Jesus's
[53:19] disposition if he said
[53:23] something those angels would have helped
[53:25] him
[53:30] the prophet
[53:32] says that are in
[53:36] heaven the Angels were saying
[53:40] father what they will do to your
[53:44] [Music]
[53:46] son do you want us to go
[53:49] [Music]
[53:50] down and and bring us storms and
[53:53] annihilate them all no said
[53:59] no because he has to go
[54:06] alone remember there will be things you
[54:08] will have to do
[54:12] alone the majority of the
[54:15] time men of
[54:18] God they have to cry
[54:22] alone where no one hear sees them
[54:28] that was the condition of
[54:30] Jesus when he was there in
[54:33] Gethsemane crying
[54:35] out praying to the
[54:39] Lord Bible
[54:41] says that a legion of
[54:46] Angels Came to strengthen
[54:50] him said look in fours over there in
[54:53] four Callins
[54:56] there is a
[54:58] people that are waiting for your
[55:04] decision did you know the Bible
[55:08] says that Jesus knew all
[55:11] things Jesus knew you
[55:14] Brothers he knew about
[55:20] you Jesus felt
[55:24] alone
[55:25] he experimented loneliness just the same
[55:28] as you
[55:29] do he experimented
[55:34] pain the pain that you sometimes
[55:37] feel he felt it as
[55:43] well that's why the Bible was not
[55:48] mistaken when they said that he
[55:53] experimented so much
[55:59] that God
[56:04] constituted positioned him as a high
[56:07] priest for you and
[56:12] I because he he knows exactly how you
[56:15] feel because that's that's why he
[56:18] said if you need
[56:21] something ask it in my name
[56:25] because I
[56:27] know what you're
[56:34] feeling blessed be the name of the
[56:38] Lord when Jesus Jesus got to that
[56:44] position those angels came to strengthen
[56:49] him have you ever felt like that
[56:52] brother sometimes Maybe
[56:55] disappointed
[56:59] discouraged you feel something in your
[57:01] heart that speaks to
[57:03] you perhaps a
[57:06] call and one
[57:09] day there was such difficult
[57:12] circumstances I said
[57:16] Lord I know you dwell you dwell in the
[57:19] highest I was going through the center
[57:22] of a
[57:23] city in the middle of some
[57:27] you know when you get to a
[57:29] condition of sadness and
[57:32] pain what the devil
[57:35] wants and the first thing that he tells
[57:38] you is he says we'll just
[57:42] die it's
[57:44] easier problems are over
[57:47] with that's the first thing the devil
[57:49] tells
[57:51] us when I when I looked up
[57:57] I said Lord that building is very
[58:02] high and you know just imagine him
[58:04] falling from up
[58:07] there it would be easier than dealing
[58:09] with all these
[58:13] problems I said Lord but if you send two
[58:17] angels to help
[58:21] me simply just seeing them would be
[58:24] enough
[58:26] when I was there
[58:27] Brothers I I I I I put my head
[58:30] down but when I and I when I raised it
[58:34] up I saw my pastor coming over there
[58:37] from over
[58:38] there and he was with another
[58:43] Pastor y I said oh
[58:49] God said oh my
[58:52] God because God is so simple
[58:56] he is very
[58:58] simple he does things in
[59:03] Simplicity sometimes we are the ones
[59:05] that make them
[59:08] complicated but God is is is so
[59:15] simple when Jesus
[59:17] Brothers cried
[59:21] out he was there in the cross of calvary
[59:25] and
[59:28] then he
[59:33] experimented all things that a human
[59:35] being could experiment or go
[59:38] through the the the the sun did not give
[59:41] its
[59:43] light it was a very sad
[59:50] day but the thing that catches my
[59:52] attention of the
[59:53] disciples is that he had had told
[59:56] them he said
[59:58] men I have to
[1:00:00] go but on the third
[1:00:04] day I shall
[1:00:09] rise you know what the disciples
[1:00:12] did when they saw him over there
[1:00:19] crucified they thought that all hope was
[1:00:23] finished
[1:00:25] the prophet
[1:00:27] says that they became
[1:00:34] discouraged he said but you know what he
[1:00:36] they said oh it's all finished
[1:00:39] now I'm I'm gonna go
[1:00:42] fishing other said well
[1:00:45] Peter well we'll go with you
[1:00:50] too they crucified him on a
[1:00:52] Friday a Saturday
[1:00:57] they should have they should have
[1:00:59] been preparing
[1:01:01] themselves for
[1:01:04] Sunday because on
[1:01:07] Sunday he was going to
[1:01:12] resurrect should have been like
[1:01:16] oh should have been saying oh he
[1:01:18] promised that he he would resurrect on a
[1:01:20] sun on
[1:01:21] Sunday and where were they they were
[1:01:27] fishing the Bible
[1:01:31] says that on a Sunday
[1:01:35] morning those
[1:01:37] women uh woke up very
[1:01:42] early and the sun had come
[1:01:46] out and when they arrived
[1:01:51] there then
[1:01:53] Jesus had
[1:01:58] resurrected but Jesus was there was
[1:02:01] there in in in the grave or in the
[1:02:07] cemetery I imagine they greeted him good
[1:02:11] morning said good
[1:02:15] morning they went to go see the
[1:02:18] tomb and they didn't find
[1:02:22] him they went on this said uh
[1:02:26] sir what happened to the man that was
[1:02:29] right
[1:02:30] here the Bible
[1:02:33] says that they did not recognize
[1:02:39] him they they had confused
[1:02:42] him with with the guy that maintains the
[1:02:45] the cemer the
[1:02:46] grave or the one that that does the
[1:02:49] maintenance
[1:02:51] on and and they asked where did you put
[1:02:53] him
[1:02:55] Jesus
[1:02:57] said
[1:02:59] Mary she said a
[1:03:03] master that's why Brothers it's so
[1:03:08] important to learn to hear the voice of
[1:03:12] God because one day he's goingon to
[1:03:16] call you are going to have to
[1:03:21] answer that God would open our eyes for
[1:03:25] and we would understand and
[1:03:29] comprehend what God has for you and
[1:03:34] I those women Jesus told
[1:03:37] them go quickly and tell my
[1:03:42] disciples that I have
[1:03:45] resurrected what do you think happened
[1:03:50] Brothers went
[1:03:53] Jesus we've seen
[1:03:55] him he has
[1:03:59] resurrected the Bible says
[1:04:01] that they did not believe
[1:04:07] them they didn't
[1:04:13] believe that's why it's very
[1:04:17] different to be a
[1:04:20] Christian somebody professes that
[1:04:22] professes to be a Christian
[1:04:26] instead of and a genuine
[1:04:30] Christian a genuine Christian brother he
[1:04:34] he believes
[1:04:36] it even if he doesn't see it he believes
[1:04:42] it and if you
[1:04:46] notice when Jesus was there amongst
[1:04:49] them him even being
[1:04:53] there
[1:04:54] they said they could not believe
[1:04:59] it him them seeing him
[1:05:05] there they said that they couldn't
[1:05:07] believe it out of the
[1:05:15] joy sometimes I I understand what it is
[1:05:18] what the joy of the Lord
[1:05:20] is but sometimes we Rejoice so
[1:05:23] much
[1:05:24] that we don't
[1:05:31] believe why I have
[1:05:35] understood the one thing is the
[1:05:38] anointing and another thing is the
[1:05:42] truth did you know
[1:05:44] brothers that the
[1:05:47] anointing bring so many marvelous
[1:05:51] things and that's what what what makes
[1:05:53] it so lucrative
[1:05:55] the the the the religious system
[1:05:58] so because with the anointing
[1:06:05] Brothers you know what the the pastor
[1:06:09] does oh Brothers we need an offering for
[1:06:11] the
[1:06:14] Lord because he's under an
[1:06:18] anointing and and in the
[1:06:23] anointing
[1:06:24] look at
[1:06:27] Elijah Elijah was under an
[1:06:33] anointing and he killed 400
[1:06:37] prophets but without the
[1:06:40] anointing he was running from a
[1:06:46] woman but the anointing
[1:06:50] Brothers the anointing
[1:06:53] Brothers
[1:07:02] for the title deed of your
[1:07:11] house
[1:07:13] Brothers but when the truth
[1:07:17] comes the truth establishes
[1:07:22] you it put you in a position
[1:07:27] position that's why this word
[1:07:33] Brothers they're they're prohibiting to
[1:07:35] even speak of
[1:07:37] Jesus because that name
[1:07:40] Brothers it's it's a
[1:07:43] blessing for the entire
[1:07:47] world just some people have made it so
[1:07:52] lucrative
[1:07:56] but there something that Jesus
[1:07:58] reproached to the
[1:07:59] disciples it was of their
[1:08:05] unbelief they said they said do not be
[1:08:08] unbelievers he told
[1:08:09] them be
[1:08:13] Believers because what God wants is
[1:08:19] Believers it doesn't matter the
[1:08:22] circumstances
[1:08:24] God needs people to believe
[1:08:29] him so you can say from now on I'm not
[1:08:31] going to
[1:08:36] complain Jesus said these
[1:08:39] words you without
[1:08:43] me can do
[1:08:47] nothing Brothers if you don't have
[1:08:51] Jesus it doesn't matter the efforts that
[1:08:53] you
[1:08:55] give or what you try to
[1:08:59] do you will not achieve
[1:09:03] it but if you have
[1:09:07] Jesus if you have Jesus
[1:09:12] Brothers this this
[1:09:16] evening Heaven is at your
[1:09:22] disposition
[1:09:25] don't be fearful brothers or
[1:09:30] scared the world is is is is turning
[1:09:33] upside
[1:09:36] down but the people that know their
[1:09:40] God they shall
[1:09:43] recognize and they shall
[1:09:47] act Jesus said when you
[1:09:51] see and this over here this happening
[1:09:55] here he said
[1:09:58] Rejoice Rejoice he
[1:10:02] said
[1:10:05] because your
[1:10:07] Redemption is
[1:10:11] n let's not be halfway
[1:10:16] Christians did you know that Peter stood
[1:10:18] before
[1:10:19] Jesus he said look
[1:10:22] Jesus it's NE
[1:10:24] Neary I'm going to die with
[1:10:30] you it's
[1:10:33] necessary I will
[1:10:36] die for
[1:10:38] you that was not God's
[1:10:45] plan Peter didn't know what he was
[1:10:50] saying so that time of trial came
[1:10:55] because as long as we're in a group
[1:10:57] Brothers as long as we're
[1:11:00] together we we we think we're pretty
[1:11:05] tough like the men young men when
[1:11:07] they're
[1:11:08] together they see a young lady Go
[1:11:11] by they they they think a whole lot of
[1:11:15] themselves but leave them
[1:11:21] alone what's your name
[1:11:31] Peter said I understand and
[1:11:34] know that you're the Christ the son of
[1:11:37] the Living
[1:11:39] God and I will stand for
[1:11:43] you be careful with your words
[1:11:47] brothers be
[1:11:49] careful you know
[1:11:52] why because the devil has already heard
[1:11:58] them here I
[1:12:02] come look the brother's doing so and so
[1:12:05] thing
[1:12:14] really Jesus said look
[1:12:17] Peter
[1:12:19] Satan I already
[1:12:21] talked how many speak
[1:12:26] how many the saint speak
[1:12:31] to sometimes you talk to
[1:12:35] Satan it's like you talk with
[1:12:38] God you need to talk with Satan to
[1:12:42] you read the message the prophet says
[1:12:44] tells tell the
[1:12:46] devil depart for
[1:12:52] me
[1:12:57] just like Jesus is the same
[1:13:02] yesterday Satan doesn't change his
[1:13:04] strategies
[1:13:14] either when uh Peter
[1:13:19] comes
[1:13:21] Jesus Jesus said I have I have prayed
[1:13:23] for you that your
[1:13:26] faith fail
[1:13:31] not that's what the Christian should not
[1:13:33] lack is
[1:13:35] Faith
[1:13:37] Peter he had good
[1:13:43] intentions but Christian is not measured
[1:13:45] by his good by his good
[1:13:47] intentions Peter took out his sword and
[1:13:51] said he said you die
[1:13:58] and Jesus Peter that's not how you do it
[1:14:01] the prophet
[1:14:03] said Jesus had to
[1:14:06] correct Peter's
[1:14:09] error how many times does
[1:14:13] God have to correct our
[1:14:19] errors when that time
[1:14:22] came Peter denied
[1:14:27] Jesus you know what happened with with
[1:14:31] that
[1:14:33] night Judas had had hung
[1:14:38] himself and that spirit that followed
[1:14:41] that that followed
[1:14:43] Judas it was following
[1:14:47] Peter to to so that he would hang
[1:14:51] himself you know what happened was that
[1:14:53] Peter didn't find a
[1:14:56] rope and he could not hang
[1:15:00] himself because he felt ashamed about
[1:15:02] what he had
[1:15:04] done difference between a genuine
[1:15:07] Christian
[1:15:10] brothers that he repents about what he's
[1:15:14] done he corrects
[1:15:17] his he departs from from
[1:15:20] Evil and he is able to obtain Mercy
[1:15:26] after that time Peter
[1:15:30] Brothers they were they were
[1:15:33] hid they were persecuted and and and and
[1:15:37] and trying to imprison
[1:15:40] them and they were uh they were
