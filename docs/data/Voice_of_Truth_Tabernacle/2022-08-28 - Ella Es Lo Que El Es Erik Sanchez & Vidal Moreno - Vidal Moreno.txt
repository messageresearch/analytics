and fort collins but our sister vicky is still there my name is we sent her a greeting he will give us the right words is she is what he is how does god see the woman you know abraham david noah jose joseph josue joshua et cetera et cetera but as you read yes or be under the teaching of a rabbi in la corte they could not testify in court women that were divorced for any reason didn't have legal rights and in the worst of cases they were murdered can you imagine how difficult and how sad how many [Music] to the woman and places where women were present places like villages street side on the that is in luke as it went that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house and she had a sister called mary jesus which also sat at jesus feed and heard his word also jesus jesus invited mary magdalene to unite to his ministry team and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and village preaching showing glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the twelve were with him and a certain woman which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities lucas and a woman having an issue of blood 12 urchoid has spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed by any behind him and touched the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stanched this woman anything she touched was impure for 12 years the man saw her that way but the lord jesus christ yes and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at me in the pharisee's house brought an alabaster box of ointment yesterday and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment wanted to stay with him he stayed for two days in samaria magdalena trusted it to mary magdalene and told her to go and tell the disciples amongst the dead see john 2017. yes i ascended to my father and and that he had spoken these things to her how does the lord back then [Applause] and transformed and every one see what the lord about this woman that anointed his head with ointment matthew 26 12. foreign has poured this ointment on my body she did it for my bureau verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman has done be told for a memorial of her man what you sisters argan whatever you do for the lord it will be taken in account and it will be taken like a great memorial if you help me with this this image um human flesh no important significante no matter how little or insignificant he cared morales alcoholics whatever it was in chicago i think of little rosella griffith in chicago her book is coming out now quentin tambil algran association that came into the meeting so vile till the great alcoholics anonymous had turned her down and about six or eight famous hospitals of chicago had wrote her name off the book never to come there maybe those hospitals removed her name of the world until the only thing she had left was a code that her mother gave her parameters she cut it on the inside to put her bottles down into there such an alcoholic [Music] smart [Music] where we was having a meeting but she's an alcoholic a to save alcoholics but i enjoyed it and i give thanks to god my brother titus shared with me of this fragile vessel it doesn't mean it's a weak vessel but on all the contrary it's made of a special material do a lot i believe he closed with a golden brush although the woman wasn't created in the original creation i believe that was a ceiling with a golden brush sealing god bless you brother [Applause] god bless everyone um if you would just uh stand with me for a little bit yeah now open your bibles to the book of genesis chapter two ayan hennessey's capital of those verse 23. saying greetings to the brothers mr manos genesis 2 verse 23. reads like this this i see and adam said this is now a bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man says therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh this is actually the first time recorded in the bible the man expresses himself towards somebody so he expresses himself towards his his his wife elsa espresso those were his of uh first words towards somebody similar to to who he was that's that was uh to me that just kind of stood out to me how he just expresses himself and i could just imagine uh you know that moment and he sees uh the most beautiful thing that he has ever seen outside of god and he says you know this is bone of my bone so that means flesh of my flesh in and i just kind of uh just got into a little bit what actually the bone and flesh is you know and then that's exactly what it is that's what i would say more to i would incline more to saying something softer because it's more fragile but you know what we man couldn't be couldn't be man without without either perro you see man could not be he could not be one flesh you know had he not had that softer side amen so there had to be the the the the hard side of man i wouldn't say solve the strong side the stronger style you know but you know he couldn't be one flesh you know without that softer side so in other words he was and then he just felt lonely for a moment so he needed he could step on somebody that would be equal to what he wanted that's what i believe i believe man is not better than women [Music] that last sub brought us so that he could finish you know the creation amen amen i believe that 100 percent you know because god just keeps showing his greatness he goes from faith to faith from glory to glory and glory and when he's saying when adam saw this woman he had never seen anything you know he uh he says he says this in the restoration of the bride tree restoration he says but watch him say he was god's perfect prophet tree speaking of jesus here perfecto prophet he said the example tree the bridegroom tree amen el ar vol novio a man glory gloria he says i'm going to say something directly it says if he is the bridegroom tree do you believe it this is from the garden of eden it says in the bridegroom tree without the female don't of what the what could god do how could he express himself if if he did not have a bride if he didn't have somebody that that that was made of the same material what he says we reflect god as god is in us that's how your walks your talks your actions all reflect christ because you might not think that people are watching you but they're watching every our business amen amen and when we think about this this god you know we we want to express what he wants or what he is when we think about god we want to express what he is not what he is amen amen that that's what he wants that's what he's looking for you said he's not looking for a for a bribe he's not looking for that woman oh that that does not trust him that does not trust in his power that does not trust in his words but that's fearful that's fearful that he's scared of taking him at his word because then you're showing the people because then you're showing the people who's telling them if you don't act on his words you're not trusting i don't want people to think that i serve a god that's scared salvation amen amen that's why she's so special special you know she's so special i'm going to be closing here in a bit and give myself some time but uh the woman she just has something very special especially it's pretty insane i saw enclave oh what what the woman can do okay she just moves uh the man in a certain way you know when there's actual love oh there ai you know i'm gonna say this my wife's not here so i'm not i'm not putting her on the spot and uh i can kind of identify with adam you know when he saw her for the first time and uh just uh just it just kind of it was just something man i can't really explain it yes but i believe that this is uh something you know that um adam may have felt the adam felt okay you know when he saw his wife when he's when he felt loved for the very first time towards another being like him a man a man you know and and i can see this oh you know in in in in the fall and and you know a lot of times muchas vez says you see we we don't fully understand many times completely oh you know the the the fragile uh um side of of of our other half eladon without her you know so that's where the devil is that's where he'll attack but that's where he'll attack the man he can't take the man down that's right we have to by anybody else that jesus had for his church jesus yeah i just want to read one more quote from brother branham remember remember our thought is she is what he is he says now he is looking for the day for the day that the for that bribe to be formed just exactly like it was like he was esperanto it's got to be his same flesh and them two then become one this he was you know i was just kind of expressing with the pastor especially um the other day hello just kind of wondering why jesus you know in in in revelations 3 17 you know he just expresses that he would spew you know the the church out of his mouth you know why why would we be in his mouth no we're uh the reason you know i believe it's because we're we're an expression of what he is an expression because they're not expressing what he is don't give them another they have nothing to show for them they have no out of it because if they did they would realize how poor they are when it's all you know we think it's all over nope you know i don't think that uh the true church you know croqueta verdadera the real bride of jesus jesus she won't trust in what she is yeah no confirm okay yes so trust in what he is oh she'll trust in what he did but she won't trust in her own strengths if there's a [Music] we are his expressions amen amen and you know that's all i have brothers god bless you [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] oh [Music] [Music]
