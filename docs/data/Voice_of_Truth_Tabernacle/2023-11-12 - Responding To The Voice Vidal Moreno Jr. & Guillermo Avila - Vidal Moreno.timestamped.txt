[28:33] John chapter
[28:37] 10 verse
[28:42] 27 we want to uh preach with uh the
[28:47] title responding to the
[28:53] voice let us uh read the the word of the
[28:56] Lord
[28:59] John 10 verse
[29:01] 27 it reads like
[29:04] this says my sheep hear my voice and I
[29:08] know them and they follow
[29:13] me um John 15 verse
[29:22] 13 John 15 verse
[29:26] 13
[29:28] reads like
[29:29] this says greater love hath no man than
[29:32] this that a man laay down his life for
[29:34] his
[29:39] friends uh let us bow our heads in
[29:43] prayer Heavenly Father we're so grateful
[29:46] Lord this
[29:48] morning for the privilege that you uh
[29:51] that you give
[29:53] us uh to come before your presence
[29:56] Lord to be able to speak your
[29:59] word that brings life to your
[30:03] church that quickens the dead
[30:06] father we just ask Lord that you move in
[30:09] every heart
[30:11] Lord in every heart that's expecting
[30:13] Lord great from
[30:16] you because I believe there's nothing
[30:18] greater than your
[30:20] word we just we just uh we're just
[30:23] grateful
[30:24] Lord and we just uh we just Des desire
[30:27] that that you would just move amongst
[30:31] us and just Quicken every fiber of our
[30:34] body
[30:36] Lord that we would uh that we would
[30:40] live uh live live for your purpose
[30:43] father put ourselves in your
[30:46] hands that we ask this in the name of
[30:48] our Lord Jesus
[30:50] Christ amen amen uh you may be
[30:55] seated um
[30:59] responding to the
[31:01] voice
[31:03] uh you know our Lord Jesus
[31:07] Christ you know when he's uh speaking
[31:10] here he
[31:13] uh there's two things that he says that
[31:15] really uh catch my
[31:19] attention uh you know he says my sheep
[31:22] hear my
[31:24] voice and he says and then and and they
[31:27] and they follow
[31:28] me amen
[31:31] amen so there's a
[31:35] hearing and then there's and then
[31:37] there's a there's an
[31:39] action uh because when you uh when you
[31:42] hear
[31:44] something a lot of times it seems like
[31:46] people don't hear
[31:49] anything you know it's like it's like
[31:51] they they they're they're
[31:55] dead you know because there's no action
[31:57] behind behind what they
[32:01] heard you know and a lot of times it's
[32:03] not so much the people out there that
[32:05] are
[32:08] hearing uh you know that it's not it's
[32:11] not their fault a lot of
[32:13] times other times it's behind the pulpit
[32:17] amen because there has to be a a
[32:20] quickened
[32:22] words you know something that has life
[32:24] in
[32:25] it it it order to
[32:28] produce an
[32:31] action amen amen you know the the the
[32:34] phes you know in this
[32:37] chapter you know they come and they uh
[32:41] they want uh they want an answer from
[32:44] the
[32:45] Lord it seemed like they were uh for
[32:48] some reason in
[32:51] suspense no they they they come and they
[32:53] tell
[32:55] them like don't leave us in suspense or
[32:57] in doubt any
[33:00] longer uh you know but the
[33:04] Lord the Lord had reminded reminds
[33:08] them of all the things he had done up to
[33:11] this
[33:13] point amen amen uh because he had done
[33:16] many
[33:17] things he he had had shown them many
[33:22] miracles uh many
[33:24] signs uh up to that point
[33:28] but they they wanted uh they wanted
[33:32] more but uh Matthew I want you to go to
[33:35] Matthew 12 verse
[33:41] 40 something that uh our brother Isaac
[33:44] touched on a little
[33:46] bit touched on Jonas on Friday on Jonah
[33:51] Friday it says for as as as Jonas was
[33:54] three days and three nights in the wells
[33:57] belly so shall the son of man be three
[34:00] days and three nights in the heart of
[34:02] the
[34:11] earth you know when uh the the when the
[34:14] the Pharisees you know ask the Lord for
[34:16] a
[34:19] sign you know he tells them you're not
[34:21] going to get any any other
[34:25] sign
[34:27] uh than the sign of the prophet
[34:32] Jonah because up to that point he had
[34:34] done many
[34:37] things uh and and you know they still
[34:39] didn't
[34:40] believe they didn't believe the
[34:43] Miracles oh they didn't believe the the
[34:45] the
[34:47] signs and so they weren't going to
[34:49] believe
[34:51] anything but but Jonah when Jonah was
[34:54] sent to uh to n
[34:59] oh there there was something that there
[35:00] was a lot of things that he didn't
[35:03] do and the people still
[35:06] believed you see Jonah didn't he didn't
[35:09] perform any
[35:12] Miracles Jonah didn't have forgiveness
[35:14] for
[35:15] him he had no
[35:17] mercy he had no
[35:19] love and they still believed the
[35:22] preaching of the
[35:25] word and is telling
[35:28] them all I'm going to give you
[35:31] now is the preaching of the
[35:34] word see I don't believe it's any
[35:36] different in this
[35:38] day because I believe the Lord Has Done
[35:40] many things in our
[35:43] Liv worked many
[35:46] miracles
[35:49] wond
[35:52] comprehend he's done
[35:54] it and we still want a sign
[35:58] we still want some kind of
[36:02] indication if it's him or
[36:04] not well he tells us the same thing
[36:08] today I won't give you anything
[36:11] else but the preaching of the
[36:16] word amen
[36:19] amen don't get me
[36:22] wrong the Lord still does great
[36:25] things
[36:27] but if it seems like after he's done
[36:29] he's he's done great
[36:32] things it seems like we're uh we're
[36:34] quick to forget
[36:36] him and uh we're ready to ask for
[36:39] another
[36:41] one as if he had never done
[36:45] anything so I believe that the Lord
[36:47] Jesus was in his every
[36:50] right to not give them any more
[36:54] signs uh because you know it seemed like
[36:56] like they were the ones that were trying
[36:57] to set the
[37:01] standard you know but but the only one
[37:03] that puts the standard is our lord
[37:07] Jesus standard he has for every son and
[37:10] daughter of
[37:12] God is to have
[37:15] faith that's the
[37:17] standard that's what he wants from every
[37:19] single one of
[37:21] us amen amen I want to read a quote from
[37:25] uh brother brandom
[37:28] you know when he talks about the
[37:32] voice it says the same voice that
[37:35] summoned
[37:37] John come up the same voice that said to
[37:41] John come up it's the same voice that
[37:45] will summon the church
[37:48] someday also the same voice that
[37:50] summoned John to come
[37:54] up is the same voice that summoned dead
[37:57] Lazarus out of the
[38:00] Grave it says that same voice of the
[38:05] Archangel it says Christ is the voice of
[38:08] the
[38:10] Archangel oh that trumpet voice of
[38:13] Christ summon John to come
[38:19] up the same voice that summoned
[38:23] Lazarus it says did you notice at the
[38:25] grave of Lazarus
[38:29] he spoke with a loud
[38:31] voice not just said Lazarus come
[38:35] forth he says
[38:38] Lazarus come forth you summon him from
[38:42] the
[38:44] dead and he
[38:46] answered here am I and he come from the
[38:50] dead after he was dead and his body rot
[38:55] in amen
[38:58] amen I believe we have the
[39:01] privilege uh this
[39:03] morning of being able to hear that same
[39:07] voice amen amen I believe it
[39:12] 100% I believe uh that the word of
[39:17] God spoken through a vessel of
[39:21] God is no different than the voice of
[39:23] God for this
[39:25] day
[39:27] amen amen you see because they were many
[39:30] of them were
[39:32] saying they they were saying well well
[39:34] show us a
[39:36] sign you know when the rich
[39:38] man when the rich man heard
[39:42] Jesus and Jesus asks him to do
[39:47] something he didn't quite
[39:51] hear exactly
[39:53] what what was being asked of Hima
[39:58] you see uh
[40:00] because a lot of times we don't like
[40:02] what we
[40:04] hear you know it's like we get that rich
[40:06] man
[40:09] syndrome amen amen the reason I say
[40:14] that is because there was no
[40:18] response to uh to what Jesus asked him
[40:21] to
[40:22] do you know and I believe it's a lot
[40:24] whole lot different many times
[40:28] because now we come to
[40:29] church now we hear God's
[40:33] word there's no response to the
[40:37] word there's no
[40:40] obedience to the word of God when God
[40:43] asks you to do
[40:45] something and you act like you don't
[40:47] hear
[40:48] it I want to let you
[40:51] know that there's a problem there you
[40:55] know there's a spiritual death that's
[41:00] happening you know there's a spiritual
[41:02] death that's
[41:05] happening and you know and it's it's
[41:08] it's not so much out in the
[41:10] world you know a lot of times it's here
[41:13] in the
[41:14] church a lot of times we think we're
[41:18] alive but we're dying on the church
[41:22] PE there's no
[41:25] action no
[41:27] obedience there's no
[41:33] humility but
[41:35] Jesus he didn't come just tell us what
[41:37] to
[41:39] do but he came to show us how to
[41:43] do that's right you see I don't have a
[41:47] lot of respect for
[41:49] somebody uh that tells me to do
[41:54] something and they themselves don't
[41:57] can't do
[41:58] it there's a lot of
[42:00] people that are given a
[42:03] position they're given a
[42:05] place and and they just because it was
[42:09] given to
[42:11] them they think that they could just
[42:13] order people to do
[42:18] things when they themselves don't know
[42:20] how to do
[42:22] it see I don't believe that that's a
[42:24] true leader amen
[42:27] because I'm not saying a leader has to
[42:29] know
[42:32] everything but he does have to get
[42:36] involved he has to get involved in the
[42:38] in in in things of the
[42:42] church he has to show you how to be
[42:45] humble he has to show you he has to show
[42:48] you the way of
[42:51] God because he's been put in a
[42:53] leadership
[42:55] role
[42:58] amen
[43:03] amen I mean could you
[43:08] imagine if
[43:11] Jesus had spoke you know Lazarus come
[43:16] forth and nothing would have
[43:21] happened you see there's a lot of
[43:24] people uh you know they they they they
[43:27] tell somebody to do
[43:30] something and it's not
[43:34] done you know it would be a shame it
[43:37] would be a shame you know if if this if
[43:41] if this would have been the situation
[43:42] with
[43:44] Jesus but you know it
[43:47] wasn't you know but this happens in
[43:49] church a lot of
[43:50] times you know what I'm I'm I'm guilty
[43:53] I'm I'm I'm a guilty person
[43:57] I don't believe I'm the only one
[43:58] amen you know when God calls us to
[44:01] complete
[44:04] obedience and you know and we don't do
[44:09] it it it's it's
[44:12] uh it's pretty
[44:16] disappointing you know but what's more
[44:20] disappointing is when you acknowledge
[44:22] that you haven't done certain
[44:25] things
[44:28] and you don't do anything to fix
[44:33] it amen amen you know I I want to read a
[44:36] quote from Brother
[44:39] brandom you know in the message the end
[44:41] time
[44:47] seed he says that's the way the people
[44:50] gets away from the word of
[44:54] God it becomes a hybrid
[44:58] Affair it must die it says it cannot
[45:02] bring forth of its kind to life
[45:07] again it says now listen to this it says
[45:10] the church that will refuse to believe
[45:12] the word of
[45:14] God is a hybrid
[45:17] church with dogmas a Creeds a doctr
[45:23] that's not
[45:24] scriptural it says that church cannot
[45:27] bring forth the spirit filled child
[45:29] because it's
[45:35] hybrid it's no
[45:37] good it might be
[45:39] bigger a great big
[45:42] wall ofine
[45:44] pews of big
[45:46] bells
[45:48] seats but that doesn't mean one
[45:52] thing it's spiritually dead
[45:57] it cannot bring forth spirit filled
[46:04] children because it's dead
[46:08] itself amen amen you see I believe but
[46:12] that when when we hear the word of
[46:15] God you see it should
[46:19] Quicken it should take us to an
[46:22] action you see that's the response
[46:27] that God wants he wants to see
[46:30] action he wants to see you do
[46:33] something you it it may not be a big
[46:36] thing you know to somebody
[46:38] else but if you're doing it for
[46:41] God if you're doing it for his
[46:44] children then it's as if you were doing
[46:46] it for God
[46:49] himself but you know we we like to run
[46:51] from those
[46:53] things we like to run from resp
[46:58] responsibility you know we got of push
[47:00] our jobs off on somebody
[47:03] else amen amen or is it just
[47:06] me you know because I'm I'm guilty of
[47:09] it but you know God doesn't want that he
[47:13] wants you to take
[47:16] responsibility he wants you to take
[47:19] ownership to take ownership of of of
[47:22] what he called you to
[47:24] do
[47:27] he wants you to
[47:28] say here am
[47:30] I behold I'm
[47:33] here I'm ready to go to the
[47:36] work you see when Jesus
[47:39] came he didn't come so that everybody
[47:41] would come serve
[47:43] him but he went to go
[47:46] serve he went to go Serve the
[47:49] People wherever he
[47:52] went he was doing
[47:54] something to the point that the
[47:57] reputation he
[47:59] had it went ahead of
[48:02] him it went before him see Jesus Jesus
[48:06] before he got to a
[48:09] place they were already doing
[48:12] something see that's the type of
[48:14] reputation the children of God should
[48:18] have when people find out you're
[48:23] going you know they should be already
[48:27] active because a child of God if you're
[48:30] a son or daughter of
[48:32] God your
[48:35] reputation will take people to
[48:39] action there's something inside of
[48:42] you because there's a name that's
[48:44] backing you
[48:46] up not so much a
[48:49] name but a god a true and living
[48:54] God with with
[48:57] power with a word of
[49:01] power that takes you to do something for
[49:09] him but
[49:12] when when we find out where he's where
[49:15] where we're going a lot of
[49:18] times because Jesus wasn't just leading
[49:20] them in the
[49:24] blind you know work like
[49:26] that he wasn't leading them on some kind
[49:29] of suicide
[49:31] mission and he's not leading you he's
[49:34] not leading you to a suicide
[49:38] mission if you trust
[49:40] God you know he may put you in an
[49:43] uncomfortable
[49:46] situation you know he may take things
[49:48] away from
[49:50] you and you may not like
[49:53] it but he's showing you
[49:56] you know that the Way
[49:59] Up Is
[50:00] Down amen amen I believe that you see
[50:05] because Jesus he wasn't running from
[50:09] death but because the
[50:13] mission death was actually a part of
[50:15] that
[50:17] mission amen and he wasn't running from
[50:21] it he was running to
[50:24] it
[50:26] he was going to
[50:27] it he was ready to face
[50:31] it no matter what it
[50:33] was and no matter who was in his way no
[50:37] matter what
[50:39] obstacle no matter who was with
[50:42] them and who wasn't
[50:44] with he was going all the
[50:48] way the disciples tried to stop
[50:52] them but they couldn't do it that leads
[50:55] me to
[50:57] believe that there are people even in
[51:00] the
[51:01] church that are going to try to stop
[51:04] you fulfilling God's work from
[51:07] fulfilling God's
[51:09] work but if you're a true son or
[51:12] daughter of
[51:13] God are you keep pushing
[51:16] through you keep
[51:19] persevering keep
[51:21] walking you'll keep
[51:23] fighting even if you're
[51:26] uing if you're in
[51:28] pain even if it's almost too much to
[51:32] bear you're going to keep
[51:35] going you trusted
[51:38] God you trusted him when it was
[51:41] good and you trust him when it's looking
[51:45] bad you trust him through the
[51:48] trial you trust through the
[51:52] Temptation
[51:53] understanding and knowing
[51:56] that you will be
[51:58] rejected amen amen you'll be
[52:01] rejected you see I got to
[52:04] thinking I got to
[52:07] thinking you see Jesus just kept
[52:10] going he he got rejected by his own
[52:16] people he got rejected for doing
[52:20] good amen amen that was one of the
[52:24] reasons
[52:27] I believe part of the
[52:31] reason that hell couldn't hold
[52:35] them the hell couldn't hold
[52:38] them because like our Pastor
[52:41] said and like the word
[52:46] says they weren't
[52:49] worthy they weren't worthy of having him
[52:51] down
[52:53] there too good for him
[52:56] so he was
[52:58] expelled he was expelled from
[53:01] [Music]
[53:02] Hell much for them to
[53:05] hear and you know it's the same way with
[53:09] you go out doing
[53:12] good you go out doing
[53:15] good and they're going to reject you as
[53:18] well not for doing something
[53:21] bad you know there's people that go to
[53:24] school
[53:25] and they get
[53:27] expelled they expel them they get
[53:30] expelled for doing something
[53:33] bad but we're living in an
[53:35] age where they're they're rejecting
[53:39] you for doing good for doing the right
[53:44] thing because that's not good to
[53:47] them the Bible says in the last
[53:51] days that they would call they would
[53:54] call good evil and Evil
[53:58] good but what will you respond
[54:01] to will you respond to the
[54:04] voice to the voice of God in this last
[54:08] days to the word of
[54:10] God because Lazarus
[54:14] responded because he had a
[54:17] seed he had the seed of
[54:19] God that would not allow him to stay in
[54:22] the
[54:23] grave it won allow you to stay
[54:27] down going allow you to stay in your
[54:31] condition on your
[54:33] circumstances it won't allow you to stay
[54:37] falling not only will it bring you
[54:41] up but it'll take you
[54:43] out that's exactly what it'll
[54:46] do May our brother come
[54:49] forward God bless
[54:54] you
[54:56] [Music]
[55:06] how many can thank the Lord for his
[55:14] wordin can follow me to the scripture in
[55:17] 1 Corinthians 14
[55:23] verse6 answering to The Voice
[55:29] um the Lord only has one
[55:35] voice the question this
[55:39] morning what are you answering
[55:42] to
[55:44] [Music]
[55:46] um are you responding to your
[55:51] feelings are you responding to what you
[55:54] believe
[55:56] are you responding to your
[56:02] brother that is giving you something
[56:04] that isn't God's
[56:07] word I always say
[56:11] this what I
[56:14] think doesn't
[56:16] matter many times what I believe doesn't
[56:21] matter many
[56:23] times
[56:25] what someone else believes doesn't
[56:30] matter all that matters
[56:33] is the word what the word of our Lord
[56:36] Jesus Christ
[56:38] says for me this is my
[56:41] absolute for me there's
[56:45] Assurance if I stay with the
[56:49] word my feelings don't
[56:53] count if I answer to that
[56:56] voice there is Assurance
[57:01] amen so the question
[57:04] is what do we answer
[57:08] to are we listening to The
[57:10] Voice he has one
[57:13] voice and that
[57:16] voice many times is
[57:21] uncomfortable because it's not fixing to
[57:23] how I am
[57:26] because it's not related to what I
[57:28] want and it makes me
[57:34] uncomfortable that's why the people
[57:35] don't
[57:37] accept that
[57:39] voice that reached Us in this
[57:44] time when that voice
[57:47] comes it beats
[57:50] you like gold that is
[57:53] beaten
[57:55] how how gold is
[57:59] stricken until he begins to
[58:02] project or
[58:06] reflects he that is beating
[58:09] him but it's so
[58:12] tremendous and
[58:14] painful to hear that
[58:18] voice let's bring it to pass amen
[58:23] amen I would like to
[58:26] read because we heard a lot of
[58:30] things but we don't hear his
[58:34] [Music]
[58:36] voice and the scripture says in 1
[58:38] Corinthians 14
[58:46] verse6 ahe now Brethren if I come unto
[58:50] you speaking with
[58:53] tongues
[58:57] what shall I profit you except I shall
[59:00] speak to you either by
[59:04] Revelation or by knowledge or
[59:06] prophesying or by
[59:14] Doctrine and even the things without
[59:16] Life Giving
[59:23] sound
[59:25] whether pipe or harp except they give a
[59:27] distinction in
[59:30] [Music]
[59:33] sounds how shall it be known what is
[59:35] piped or
[59:40] harped for if the trumpet give an
[59:42] uncertain
[59:45] sound who shall prepare himself to the
[59:48] battle amen
[59:51] amen and I got all of this
[59:55] from one
[59:58] message that our brother Bram
[1:00:02] preached the message is called uncertain
[1:00:06] sound what are we
[1:00:08] [Music]
[1:00:11] hearing and brother brandham
[1:00:15] speaks about the mind and the
[1:00:20] Soul how it is that we
[1:00:23] receive
[1:00:26] how we receive God's word many times in
[1:00:28] our
[1:00:30] mind but never comes to the
[1:00:35] soul and brother bam expresses himself
[1:00:38] in this
[1:00:43] message and I love so much how he says
[1:00:46] it's time to put milk
[1:00:48] aside and it's time to go in
[1:00:52] deeper that's why I say this this
[1:00:55] message is so
[1:00:58] beautiful Mage this
[1:01:00] word takes us to
[1:01:03] maturity takes us to a
[1:01:06] growth where you can be
[1:01:08] safe safe
[1:01:13] Brethren this morning if I can
[1:01:14] accomplish
[1:01:17] this to remove your conscience a
[1:01:21] little that you analyze yourself
[1:01:26] what have you
[1:01:28] heard what do you
[1:01:31] have and what's in your
[1:01:36] hearts because in the heart is a
[1:01:40] compartment where God deposited the soul
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:48] amen the prophet
[1:01:51] says in the message uncertain sound
[1:02:08] because I don't to me it doesn't matter
[1:02:10] to me what church people belongs
[1:02:15] to the main thing is if they're
[1:02:23] Christian
[1:02:27] how many times do we believe that
[1:02:28] message Believers are the only
[1:02:36] Christians we shout it and preach
[1:02:39] it but here brother
[1:02:43] brandom he says it doesn't matter to me
[1:02:45] what church people belongs
[1:02:50] to the main thing is if they're
[1:02:53] Christian
[1:02:55] and look we're
[1:02:57] walking to
[1:02:59] something that a lot of
[1:03:01] people even in
[1:03:04] denominations brother is even going to
[1:03:06] say
[1:03:09] here Catholic
[1:03:13] Church I believe there are children of
[1:03:15] God in
[1:03:16] there and in this
[1:03:19] church Message
[1:03:21] Church there are three types of
[1:03:23] believers
[1:03:25] also there's the
[1:03:27] manufactur there's the
[1:03:30] Believers and the
[1:03:33] unbelievers in this
[1:03:36] church you can uh Point them
[1:03:40] out you can't tell your brother he's an
[1:03:44] unbeliever we believe we're all
[1:03:47] believers but we know by the
[1:03:50] message it's not so amen
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:56] so brother brandham says what's in your
[1:04:00] soul what matters is if you're a
[1:04:04] Christian because there are many
[1:04:06] manufactured
[1:04:12] amen if you're Catholic if you're
[1:04:15] Protestant if you're
[1:04:18] Methodist
[1:04:20] Baptist or whatever you might
[1:04:23] be as long as you're a
[1:04:26] Christian that's the main
[1:04:30] thing
[1:04:32] Christ Christ don't look at your church
[1:04:34] you belong
[1:04:39] to because they'll all perish and go
[1:04:41] away
[1:04:43] someday and break
[1:04:46] up and they'll not be thought of
[1:04:50] anymore but the principle of
[1:04:53] Christianity
[1:04:55] is the
[1:04:56] conditions of the heart towards
[1:05:05] God and that's the thing we want like to
[1:05:08] concentrate
[1:05:11] on is to know a
[1:05:14] brother not by the church he belongs
[1:05:18] to or how he wears his
[1:05:22] clothes but what he is in his
[1:05:26] Hearts amen
[1:05:30] amen have you met beautiful
[1:05:34] people people that love the
[1:05:38] Lord people that show us said that have
[1:05:45] heard and you can see the life they
[1:05:49] live and it's a people that love the
[1:05:51] Lord amen amen
[1:05:55] and you can also see
[1:05:57] people that say they're
[1:06:01] Christian they claim to be
[1:06:06] Christian but have received an
[1:06:08] intellectual
[1:06:12] Christianity Bram in the message
[1:06:14] uncertain
[1:06:15] sound he's
[1:06:19] narrating a fiction women fictional
[1:06:23] Wom
[1:06:25] he says this
[1:06:27] sister goes to church every
[1:06:31] Sunday this
[1:06:34] sister gives her tithe her offering this
[1:06:39] sister serves in
[1:06:41] church this
[1:06:43] sister is a good
[1:06:46] sister this
[1:06:48] sister lives with her
[1:06:53] husband
[1:06:54] but begins to get along with other
[1:06:59] brothers and begins to have a different
[1:07:06] attitude because not everyone in church
[1:07:08] are
[1:07:12] Christians and she begins to listen and
[1:07:14] takes on another
[1:07:17] attitude
[1:07:19] brother she begins to act
[1:07:22] different
[1:07:25] all of a sudden she begins to see a
[1:07:30] man and she begins to see that he is
[1:07:32] more handsome than her
[1:07:38] husband and all of a sudden she says I
[1:07:40] fell in love with this
[1:07:42] man all of a sudden she
[1:07:45] says should I marry
[1:07:49] him brother Bram says she marries this
[1:07:52] man and all of a
[1:07:56] sudden she notices she finds out he is
[1:07:59] not like her
[1:08:01] husband that he is not polite like her
[1:08:06] husband but he's there already or she's
[1:08:09] there
[1:08:11] already and then she
[1:08:14] says I'm gonna look for someone
[1:08:18] else and brother Brown says she began to
[1:08:21] kill little by little
[1:08:24] that
[1:08:27] conscience that Soul inside
[1:08:32] crying because everything she had
[1:08:37] received stayed only in one
[1:08:40] place and was in her
[1:08:43] mind her
[1:08:46] intellectual never went to the
[1:08:50] heart and is if it doesn't come to the
[1:08:53] heart
[1:08:55] you can imitate a
[1:08:57] Christian you can
[1:09:00] shout that you're a Son of God but your
[1:09:04] life does not prove that you
[1:09:08] are does not prove I am that's why
[1:09:14] Jesus said to the
[1:09:16] Pharisees ohes
[1:09:20] Hypocrites you tell
[1:09:22] me good teacher good Master good
[1:09:27] Master good
[1:09:30] Master but inside your
[1:09:32] heart you hate
[1:09:35] me that is the condition you're
[1:09:39] in with your mouth you confess
[1:09:41] Hallelujah to be
[1:09:43] Christian I love my Lord my life
[1:09:48] proves I am not a
[1:09:51] Christian my life proves
[1:09:54] I hate
[1:09:56] Jesus that is
[1:09:58] hard to
[1:10:00] eat but this
[1:10:02] is the message of the
[1:10:05] hour the message we've
[1:10:08] received brother it's
[1:10:12] time go on Beyond the
[1:10:15] Veil to go
[1:10:18] beyond because one day
[1:10:21] brother when you're on your death bed
[1:10:25] that
[1:10:27] soul that soul is going to come out your
[1:10:31] mind look
[1:10:33] brotherr if you received him in your
[1:10:36] mind the day you're
[1:10:40] dying the mind will begin to
[1:10:44] die and everything you received in that
[1:10:47] mind will
[1:10:50] end but what's in the
[1:10:52] soul what is truly
[1:10:55] you will come
[1:10:57] out will
[1:10:59] shout and will
[1:11:01] say I am
[1:11:06] lost because the
[1:11:08] soul that
[1:11:10] sins Shall
[1:11:14] Perish what are you in your
[1:11:17] soul what have we
[1:11:20] received that's why Jesus tells
[1:11:22] Nicodemus
[1:11:25] Nicodemus you
[1:11:27] must be born
[1:11:31] again receive him in the
[1:11:35] soul because if you received it
[1:11:38] here you have a lot of
[1:11:42] knowledge a lot of scripture
[1:11:46] Nicodemus but you haven't received
[1:11:52] it and this
[1:11:56] thought God gave it to
[1:11:59] me for the
[1:12:02] condition or what we are going
[1:12:06] through God is has everything under
[1:12:10] control and everything helps for
[1:12:15] good for us seeing my
[1:12:18] uncle the condition he's currently
[1:12:22] in
[1:12:26] bedridden he can't
[1:12:29] speak his strength is
[1:12:33] waning but his soul is
[1:12:40] resting even the nurses are
[1:12:47] admired they say I have 10 years helping
[1:12:50] aiding people that are dying and I
[1:12:54] admire
[1:12:55] Gustavo his
[1:13:00] faith how he is at
[1:13:05] peace how he is resting in the
[1:13:08] Lord how nothing matters to
[1:13:12] him when there are
[1:13:15] people that don't want to
[1:13:18] die there are people fighting to not
[1:13:22] die they don't want to
[1:13:25] die because there's a
[1:13:28] conscience that is
[1:13:32] screaming I truly haven't been a
[1:13:38] Christian that young lady brother
[1:13:40] brandham
[1:13:41] says I told her pastor oh
[1:13:45] Pastor you a
[1:13:47] liar you deceived me my entire
[1:13:51] life you never told me the
[1:13:55] truth and I'm here
[1:13:59] dying because we don't want
[1:14:03] that we want to hear his
[1:14:08] voice that voice has sounded that voice
[1:14:12] has sounded in this
[1:14:15] day that voice has power to transform
[1:14:20] us that voice has the power to change
[1:14:25] that voice raises the
[1:14:28] dead dead in your transgressions and
[1:14:33] sins necessary to hear his voice in this
[1:14:38] morning and that he can speak to your
[1:14:43] heart because you need to be
[1:14:46] sure because the time will
[1:14:49] come that you need to be sure oh
[1:14:53] oh I can
[1:14:55] say Daniel was
[1:15:02] sure they told them we're going to put
[1:15:04] you in the Lions
[1:15:06] Den what did Daniel
[1:15:09] have he had
[1:15:12] him he had him in his
[1:15:17] heart he didn't care what he'
[1:15:21] be he was sure
[1:15:25] certainly he was
[1:15:28] sure when you are certain in
