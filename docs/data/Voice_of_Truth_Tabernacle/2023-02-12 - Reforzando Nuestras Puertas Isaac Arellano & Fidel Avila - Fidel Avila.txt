Hallelujah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] reinforcing our uh our gates do you all have the scripture Mandisa says like this is the high priest rose up with his Brethren the priests and they builded the Sheep gate they Sanctified it and set up the doors of it even into the Tower of Mia they Sanctified it unto the Tower of hananil may be seated um Nesta Manana this morning I'd like to focus on the sheep gate in our pastor last week he left it there with the gates of of the city of Jerusalem um and I'd like to read two more scriptures before I go in deeper would be John chapter 10 you don't have to look for it they're just going to put up here on the screen and the Hebrews 11 as well the first scripture says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me in the second scriptures in Hebrews 11 6 is without faith it's impossible to please him uh He also mentioned that that the fivefold Ministries was related to that is I can see the 10 gates to our body and our spirit as well memory I wanted to review those to engage quickly the first one is which one is um the Gate of the gate then it's the Gate of the fountain la puerta del agua the Gate of the water La Puerta de los caballos de Guerra the Gate of the horses of War LA puertas and then it's the Gate of judgment I I get a little lost years so I just want to focus on the sheep gate and as we read the word of God says my sheep hear my voice how many are sheep here our Pastor said pastor a land without a pastor a shepherd and a pastor without sheep a pastor a shepherd is this morning I want to speak on the census a little bit we're taught that we have five senses The Taste here can somebody help me with two hearing the taste God gave us his senses to contact this Earth they are only Earthly I only hear in order that we would contact this Earth is because without that we can't live a normal life because we need to make contact a man there's something we lack no point we cannot live a normal life it is yeah if we were liking something in the natural and we couldn't live how much more of we like something spiritual well if we were lacking the the Natural Science if you were lacking the spiritual Faith man we go by faith amen I'm taking this out of the message the super sense God makes use of these natural senses how much more of the spiritual senses I'd like to read in the message the super sense and it says like this the first quote okay Dios diosos God gave those senses but they're given to you as a gift and I'm gonna switch to English okay and it depends how you what you heal these senses too these senses he's saying needs to be yielded to something and then he says will be the way that your life is controlled it is if I yield my senses to entertainment my senses to hurting someone if I hold my senses to football Americano I'm gonna be led by football I'm gonna be led by by destruction basically yeah well you see what you hear what you taste smell or fear whatever those senses are yielded too they won't dominate you yes it they were given to you for Earthly contact foreign [Music] and one of them is Faith Yuna is FEI and he says it's the one that governs and guides you this is and it's Superior to all the other senses appear to the other five senses how many are with me now back to the Sheep Gates this place was special is because our Pastor said is where the sacrifices came in all that I could learn was from our pastor I couldn't find this anywhere else so I would just be kind of rephrasing a couple things he said is where the sacrifices for the Temple of the Lord came in through it is and the priests and the high priest were in charge of this case and if you read the Bible says that this gay was the only one that was sanctified if we're expecting God to come for us he's not coming he said for goats he's not coming for unbelievers or he's not coming for people that are waiting for him to come still I don't want to get too deep but is the word of God the coming of the Lord has begun already sure ain't bad that's right that's right and if you want to repair your life our pastor says how many need reinforcement in their Gates how many need more armor in their games the scripture we just read was my sheep hear my voice and follow a message and they submit he says they let themselves be letters I made a decision of think uh like a year and a half ago maybe two years ago when I I fully let myself I can't say fully but I'm trying my best to be under the leadership of our pastors you know I've been trying to hear everything he tells me and Obey is because I'm his sheep and he is the Shepherd in this place and the sheep hear the voice and I don't know if sometimes bad things have happened in your life well it's because we don't hearken to the voice of the shepherd and if you ever want to hear the voice of God it's right here it's the voice of our pastors but you know I used to be maybe a little religious and I will just want God to like talk to me in a supernatural way I wanted God to for a lie to appear you know like like a movie you know but it's more simple than that because if God is more simple than that you know he gave us he a body that he could dwell in don't then because it says the sheep hear my voice I also want to bring that scripture we just read it says it says hear my voice tie this together with hearing yeah it says but without faith it is impossible to please him he said and what comes by hearing faith comes by him by hearing my pastor hear me Pastor I receive more faith I can reinforce my natural Gators of hearing amen amen it's not too hard right I'm trying to be as simple as I can by hearing my pastor is I dwindle the opportunity of the devil opportunity of doubts you know of reasoning to come in because I'm I'm being filled by the voice of the shepherd amen amen give me some time I need to take this really slow brother amen amen uh brother Branham continue saying in the message super sense he says this is the oh it's 57 in Spanish okay it says and the super sense is the holy spirit is the faith of God that dwells in you so the super sense is the Holy Spirit and the faith of God can we repeat that is the Holy Spirit and the faith of God and then he says and if you let the five senses be yielded to the sixth sense it will guide you and bring all the other five senses under control of the super sense under the control of the Holy Spirit and faith and he continues saying continuation for it's so far above the natural sense as the spiritual man it's above the natural it's as far as high as the heavens is above the natural man and his five senses foreign so many so many Saints the devil always tries to come in our five senses doesn't matter how strong you you think you are important how religious or devoted you think you are the devil can come in there because to start off the five senses are Earthly they're not spiritual senses amen amen but he says but he cannot touch that super sense that's far beyond his reach that come from God and it's called Faith glory to God I'm gonna be closing Hermanos now how will the Lord come to my life to this church Iglesia to this bride is to my family actually but I mean Familia my I have a new family you think and we need the Lord too and how is the Lord going to come into my family you know I just not just recently recientemente I had a reality check someone's spiritual life is depending on me I don't know if you have that burden as a father or mother is when you not only think of the spirit of their natural life but where were their souls no where's your children's your wives your husband's Souls where are they gonna go so how will the Lord come to us and I would like to finish how our pastor was saying that everyone is and through these Gates God wants to return to us so yielding these senses to the super sense and that comes by hearing yes and sheep here is that's why I really like to talk about this Gates and through these Gates God wants to return to this world to take back his because all this is about the coming of the Lord and how will the Lord if our defenses are down if the enemy can infiltrate at any time God wants to be received where he knows he can be safe although he doesn't need our our security okay who would want to go somewhere where you're not safe you know God wants to have fellowship and and God doesn't want that interrupted that's why there's Gates amen amen and I would like to read one last quote and the message when their eyes were open it says remember there was two trees in the Garden of Eden how many knows that one was of the tree of science the other was the tree of Faith listen the tree of Faith as long as man eat from the Tree of Faith he lived but the first part he took off the tree of science knowledge he separated himself from God and he destroyed himself he says and every time man bites from the Tree of science he destroys himself kills more people than all the wars put together himself off a cobra Obama wonder what he's going to do with that see and now if you read English let's all repeat that at the the last line at the end is on three ready one two now those three science destroys Faith Fields we're talking about building the walls is we're talking about building the gates and how are we gonna build faith and what does faith come through here again Shepherd and Pastor God bless you [Applause] amen how many have rejoiced word of God is very tremendous thank you brother for that word you know something that caught my attention brother Isaac already read the scripture I think our pastor for the trust Fresco right now that I have it fresh before I get into what I have reinforcing the gates the Gate of the sheep something that caught my attention it doesn't close it but it doesn't have a a bolt or deadbolt or a lock everything else talks of dead balls and this one doesn't it's not a coincidence the gate is open the gate I don't know about you but that um that drives me out that it makes me go crazy the gate is open right now it is open I can enter into him to the holiest place it all depends on you and I what we want to do reinforcing the gates telling us when you talked about the self-control Wednesdays and I like what he brought like what he said is just about Todd and seduced the children of God to commit fornication and eating sacrifice to Idols if you look at that yes basically seduce the people to satisfy their body to satisfy something superficial well brother Isaac read a little bit the the science tries to foreign foreign because if you focus on the internet it eventually will come in the promise we focus so much there's nothing there that's what we can't give life foreign foreign I'm very curious about things because I I put it to the test this week how many uh don't raise your hand how many are governed by these these senses five senses I see because I put myself to the test and I've said well it doesn't matter this week grab hold of it and within that there's the soul is within him Enderman well mine will show you the letters red we cannot lie to ourselves because we're good to lie to ourselves we're gonna lying about ourselves uh Las puertas I would like to put together so you can go and and study Brothers this is Sunday school Brothers your um I'm a little explosive um I like to explain a little bit if it's something that I've learned here is to uh stay calm or calm down sometimes brother Isaac spoke on the gates please these are the the gates uh how they they are tied in Las puertas how the gates with our senses no I can't talk about all of them you go home and study a man is and then uh if you have questions you can we have questions and answers later you write them all down brothers write them down the Gate of the sheep is is the hearing the door of the fish is why did we put uh affection on there because that was the Great Commission but the Great Commission if we don't have love for the people there is no love within me what will I preach that door was very clear right because sometimes we want to breathe and we're good at preaching them for me but we have to when we have to put into action the love it's just the five external senses in other words he lost the battle no control he's the son of the devil isn't that beautiful this door here I put the smell look Brothers usted we know ourselves well there has to come a time in your life as well as mine where sin the intro you stay within you and you have to do yours he does nothing the gate the horse key I put a touch sorry you know was saying that in this gate it's a gate we're the horses they are presented in the battle foreign a spiritual war going on if you feel it in the body as well okay I'm going to read a quote from the prophet here is remember we're Body Spirit and soul I don't want to get too much more into the gates you just gave a one percent of it here just a little bit you have to come already okay this is another there are five of Senses that control the flesh you know what it is he says that's to me the hour course that's the five things that you can't depend on because it's meat I'm gonna bring it very simple Brothers when you come here to church especially here to the to the sanctuary you have to poner and control so putting into control the five senses in order for the sixth sense because if you don't do it the five senses they are defeating you right now I'll put it very simple guess you can very easily say I'm gonna go to the bathroom [Music] to work he takes control I won't go to the bathroom here's the word of God but why does the person go to the bathroom because the five senses than anything else [Music] put them under subjection that's why we're we are beat brothers or defeated we have the inner courts which is the next yes and the next author enters and answers with conscience imagination memories passions and affection foreign have control you have to be born again foreign let's go eat better [Music] as we take this at least take this with you put that sixth sense to work when the site wants to control you yes your mouth wants to speak of the brother or sister the sixth sense because it helps us it helps us to avoid getting into problems and with that we will burden our pastors that's how we will help him I know the Sheep gate it didn't have a a deadbolt like he has key right from for the thieves but in the spiritual you have access you have access to enter that's tremendous isn't it because maybe I'm getting a little crazy but I'm rejoicing is [Music] the the inner senses and there would also be memories and conscious and memories and so on you shouldn't imagine things how do you do it you don't do it is an inner core within you foreign but this morning we don't want to just to stay outside something I also really liked interior between the outer courts and the inner Court Avia there was there was a Badger's kids but that means foreign T govern you or will Faith governance that's what the Badgers we make the decision what will control our governance if we are vaccinated this is the senses govern us Christian or he's of the devil it just simply he just the flesh beat him but he will recover later let's please stand Brothers let's pray Heavenly Father [Music] thank you Lord for your word [Music] I know we could bring something else something to make us jump and scream recipe but if we could just simply understand this is that my brother and I brothers and I would put this to practice we thank you Lord Glory [Music] amen [Music] let's give thanks to the Lord for his word [Music] answer [Music]
