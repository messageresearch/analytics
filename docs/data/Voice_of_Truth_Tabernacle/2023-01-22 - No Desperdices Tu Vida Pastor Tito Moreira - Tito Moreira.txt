anything Psalms 103 is uh because I learned it by memory when I was young yesterday is the Lord executive righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed notifications is action to the children of Israel the Lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous and mercy he was not always tried neither will he keep his anger forever with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for a seven is high above the Earth so great is his Mercy towards them that fear Himes as far as the East is from the West so far hath he removed our transgressions from us like as the father pitted his children I'll be focusing in verse 14. for he knows our frame he remembers that we're dust as for man his days are his grass as the flower of the field so he flourishes for the wind passes over that it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more will be speaking with our subject don't waste your life let us pray Heavenly Father Moment In This Moment We ask your Holy Spirit open our mind in our hearts our understanding Lord as your word has been spoken when you move in our hearts break bread with us foreign it was about to pass away drieste and saw him very sad Tana so frightened when he said these words I've wasted my life wasted my life he decided that his life would not be wasted anymore um you know at some point of my life uh God helped me and then there understand foreign foreign in something that wasn't worth it to waste the Spicer wasted his own life people that are more worried for not wasting money not wasting food if you're not wasting etc etc they don't realize how much life they're wasting opportunities receive again bye bye who that's Judas so worriedles for not wasting temporary resources he ended up wasting his entire life I asked myself how many of us get to the end of our time and realize I tell myself [Music] we read is [Applause] foreign foreign foreign [Music] inequity causation makes us spend more time and cause us Banas and things that are in vain can cause us and in things if there's one thing you should do is make sure you don't waste your life I wasted my life to spend a lot of time investigating what's the purpose of Our Lives purposes for life there's books YouTube videos there's YouTube videos a lot of things trying to investigate the purpose of our lives so your life can be an impact if you realize your life has no matter oh no one is that your life you can have happiness you will make an impact on this Earth one thing I want there's one thing yes says but be happy foreign life if we drink or eat let's do it all for the glory of God now I know when I say this is hard to understand to try to bring it better to your own life so you may understand um he says only one life only what is Christ will remain just one life will quickly pass will soon be passed will soon be passed only what has been done for Christ will remain I want to tell you this president if you're a Christian I'm gonna hear our Christians how many are Christians Yes to God to Christ one day or if you belong to Christ what are we doing living Our Lives to other things survives hopefully it's time today yes sir all right you know I don't believe that God now wants to make us unhappy I believe he wants us to be happy I believe happiness is in God Delight thyself also in the Lord and He Shall give Thee the desires of thine heart I want you to understand this thing God made you parachute so you were to lie in the Lord foreign serving him I enjoy Isaiah says Isaiah 6 as a prophet I said yes as the prophet Isaiah says put in chapter six you're one of his friends died and it says Atlanta is also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple but above it through the surfives each one had six wings with twine he covered his face and with 20 covered his feet and with twin he did fly recorded now he saw some seraphims they are special angels this is what they did in verse 3. and one cried onto another and said holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory now I see these angels crying holy holy holy and many of us could think how boring that's the most boring thing go to church let me tell you God showed him this vision is showing him this his purpose they were doing it [Music] in that place [Applause] [Applause] the name of the Lord foreign most horrible years of my life I want to understand one thing you are being used at your highest capability your highest capability when you use glorify God Persona because a person that is useful in God's hands Glory so much don't think you're adding something that in your life that then you'll be used at your highest capacity capacitor capability God doesn't want um when you interpret nibblers is when and they said you can play this bro well you can throw it as far as you can there's not an action however you want many of them so take the Horseshoes and go up to the nail and just put it exactly on it consistency that's simple they didn't want any effort I know there's one even further back the people that had the most uh Joy well no foreign [Music] This Promise for me and he shows himself completely through what he can do through me all right I mean now we can speak plenty on this hello I want to tell you this so if you don't want to waste your life then you need to begin today yes sir she doesn't see you as simple as that is you need to begin today yes when Isaiah this is all these seraphims this is it's up about the middle so yes I think particular says yes later upon my mouth and said Lord this had touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged this pues also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and whom will go for us then here mice and me now the first thing you must do is know that God did call you for a purpose but don't wait too long you need to begin today now beginning today the Bible says who doesn't sit down before building a building and calculate the cause start today many of us are waiting for something we're waiting to be prepared Waiting for God to show us something to do something foreign the Lord says I use you foreign amen amen right but you must begin today now beginning today significa means you might need to plan a little okay but you're doing something La planifications that you never did anything and say here in my Lord that exists whether Brandon says about Moses many times we're afraid of making mistakes but Moses he says I give more to someone that tries I give more to someone that tries than someone that never tries we can say Moses was a failure to begin again was part of God's plan [Music] want to use them Moses so the preparation Hallelujah amen God wants failures and failures only happen by trying this is in a message perseverance Moses rather going down to Egypt a nation that had the whole world scared about like Russia Today a one-man Invasion an old man 80 years [Applause] I want you to understand I need a whole church Lord [Music] one is enough California when we moved from California I told the brothers I'll be the first one to move because I know God has called me to move I didn't know I wasn't sure who else would follow I might might have stayed here alone that's a possibility gonna have to accept maybe I have to start it but I knew God called me to Colorado he wanted me over here one day I'll give accounts is having care and you know one is enough one is enough you can make the difference don't wait for someone else to do it yeah you're wasting your time the most horrible thing will be YouTubers okay yes sir okay what happens people like to grab the Horseshoe and walk up to it and place it people don't want risks people aren't willing to lose everything if you're not willing to lose everything you won't gain any anything instead of experimentary life that was taken advantage of yes a life you took advantage of David is another example when he started in front of Goliath El Nolin Porto he didn't care what he could lose many people say I'm gonna lose how many cowards that are here don't believe God lives have been wasted to lose everything that's the truth foreign [Music] all right what are we doing we wasted too much why do you want to wait longer now okay do something he doesn't want nibblers who doesn't want people I'm gonna try this here try that people that aren't committed David was committed all the great men that did something for God we're committed or surrendered crazy but he was committed Jose um there was another family foreign they died of old age and said I spent a great time in my life collection I collected all the baseball cards I've wanted and I spent most of the time that's a tragedy what difference did they make um that's why people can't find happiness because happiness is only found giving everything for God so I there's joy when you surrender everything is I won't Reserve anything don't give a true commitment Lord to something that's worth it God wants people with a passion compassion with a passion I know that their Joy is in the Lord we don't have to be complaining throughout my life it's a waste of time to be angry here you could do something good for the Eternal things [Music] God wants people with a passion if it's worth it it's worth to give everything this Chinese boy said Mr Taylor I have felt that my call in Christ my Bachelor of Arts and then go for my PhD and all I have to have my doctor's degree Mr Taylor said go now son say go now don't wait till that time comes you'll waste away too much of your life I think that's right I agree with Mr Taylor he says go now I'm not trying to support my ignorance for Education Without salvation if you don't know nothing no more than how we got lived yeah do it now Lord I'm closing with this now God wants us to be happy in what we do God didn't call us look that will be our greatest happiness the soul tiene Feliz has something that makes it happy yes and that is fulfilling God's purpose it proposal principal and the main purpose is Distributors of the purposes of Our Lives it's to give glory to God with our lives and God wants that not because he has a great ego no Perkins not because he enjoys it he does like that glorify him but because he knows that that is where our happiness is used to our fullness won't be wasted we will take the greatest risk if our life is basic because we haven't had Faith it's the truth and let me tell you life will stop being basic Ally estamos but many times we're sados angry because we're not doing what we want it let me tell you this David had a dream he was a man of Dreams or spiritual s he had a dream to build God a temple no one asked him and who says but you know he came out of David's heart to do this God didn't ask David to build the temples more from us what else can I do for you what else can we do for you Lord and He dreamed and said I want to build God a temple it's hard you know what God told him no David yeah I know it's a good dream not for a builder notos you know this so many times God tells us I didn't call you for that and we don't want to do anything else now [Music] but David's happiness calling was not to be calling to fight again is [Music] [Applause] I'll support you that's right amen that's right musicians can
