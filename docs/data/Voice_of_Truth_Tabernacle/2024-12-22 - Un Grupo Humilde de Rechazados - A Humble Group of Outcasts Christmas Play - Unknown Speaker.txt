despreciado por mucha gente por su propia gente por la sociedad Simplemente porque se pensaba que El Mesías iba a venir en una gran manera la gente lo estaba esperando en un gran Palacio lo estaba esperando como un gran Guerrero de guerra pero él no quiso venir de esa manera quiso venir a gente humilde loses no eran Bienvenidos en los templos no podían hacer ofrendas a su Dios eran después de los leprosos de lo más bajo que podía ha en ese tiempo y rechazado despu los pastores desprecio que ellos vivían en ese tiempo pero cuenta la historia que este pequeño pastorcito no sabiendo que iba a ofrecer agua a esta mujer llamada María llevaba en su vientre al Salvador el mundo Dios lo iba a mirar e iba a cambiar la historia de la humanidad y con ustedes los dejo con la historia de un pequeño pastor llamado [Aplausos] [Música] Good Evening in a World that often measures Worth by wealth and status there are those whose Liv seem hiden in the shadows and among Those is a young sheer namra He's humble quiet and of Dreams but yet often feel small overlook by Those around him in a society that values titles appearances ezra has Come To believe that his Life marked by dust And sheep might Be of a little importance but Tonight the Shepherd Boy Will find himself at the Heart of a greater than he Ever imagined he does not Know It yet for Now his Journey begins not with Angels or miracles but with the harsh words of those who can see What is on the surface it would be amaz [Música] so Oh Friends in a World of Grand expectation hes not Heart and Those whose hands worked in dust and whose cloes were the roughest of labor is a young Boy named a shey with a Heart that Dreams but often feels his Place in the world like a Shadow guys Can I She yeah I from here How long has it been since you took a bath you smell worse than your sheep I I just came here to get some supplies from my mother I'm not bothering anyone Maybe It's people Like You that are keeping the messiah away like

say I'm not [Música] Enough Every single Lie that tells me I will never [Música] up am I More Than Just the sun of Every High and Every [Música] low please remind me once Again Just Who I am Because I need To Know Oh po e esra leaves the Village Square his heart is heavy with the Sting of cruel words though he keeps his Head bowed his thought rises to questions he cannot answer yet does his Life truly Hold meaning Is there Place in this World Someone Like Me but as steps to his humble home he has Met with the warmth That the world outside cannot offer a mother's unwavering Faith a mother's unwavering love and all all hearts judged by appearances in ezra's home he finds a Mother Who gazes looks Beyond the dust and weariness seeing the kindness and the strength her son holds within Miriam simple Oh She is Rich in a fai that does not W What happen Nothing Just some Kids in the Village here come Tell more terrible things they called mees they said the mah Never come Because of people like me ezra Don't let The World in your heart What do they know of the messiah love but What if they're right What does God want to people like us people like me people who others think are dirty or lon ohra his heart is way down Not Just by the words but by the doubt That comes from feeling unseen Oh but Thanks to God for his mother why isn't steadfast She sees something that they and even ezra cannot see ezra Let me Tell you something the world often forgets God does not Look at Our clothes or Our title the prophet spoke of a messiah Who would come and bring light to all people Why would he Come to people like us people who others think are dirty Lonely smelling of sheep covered in Cuz my son God sees with different eyes he does not see you as the world sees you but What if they're right What if the messiah Never comes Because Because I'm not good Enough ezra the messiah is going to come for those who need him So You saying that smelling of sheep doesn't Make Me Any less important Yes and Maybe a little less popular with the Village Boys but to God ezra You are the most precious Thing in Because he says You are led but I can't feel with the he says You are strong but I feel I am weak he says You are H When I am falling short and When I don't belong Oh he says you are his so Just believe Oh I believe so Just believe I will believe What he says of you so Just believe come onra

Rest he doesn't realize it yet but his simple kindness has prepared a Place for the world's greatest gift Now Friends me to take you to another Place on the Hills stretch Under a vast expansion of stars qui and unbroken except for the soft bleeding of sheep foron Life was RM simplicity watching Waiting anding the FL there were men of dust and labor overlooked by the world but not untouched by questions that they be that theye The Silence of the night theirs unp but shared does God see Us here so Far away from the noise and the importance of the Village on this night these men Who thought themselves the least were about to encounter a message so profound it would lift the and illuminate the darkest corners of their hearts you you know Jonah do do you ever Wonder If there's more Life than than I don't know then just tending to these sheep All the time or or Being in the fields all day What are you saying are you saying You're tired of taking care of sheep That's Our That's Our Duty in Life I I I know we're Just sheff but why do I have to go unnoticed or unrecognized for we do for The towns People Maybe Maybe the the Town people look down on Us but I think God sees more in Us than than What we even [Música] see I don't know e It's kind of hard to believe When everyone Under appreciates Us and and look down on Us like as If for Nothing yeah He's right We we're the last people anybody would call on butes Things differently he knows Our lives matters in Ways that they May not see but but when's the last time Any Any FR from the Town has has thought of a Shepherd Worth More Than than than a handful of grain or or the dust off their sandals you know [Música] Maybe Maybe It's like David he he was a shepher but God chose him yeah Jonah You're right God chooses the lowest the people who You wouldn't really choose I don't know but I don't know but you you got me thinking is Maybe There is a Chance or or Maybe Maybe a slight possibility that that Maybe Maybe God sees Us too I don't know but Maybe Maybe there's just a slight Chance that that God sees Us to however small it May be yeah things much differently than we can Ever understand Hey where's your sheep going Come Back Come Back going Where you going what what What's wrong With Your Face Oh fear Not For i bring you good tidings of Great Joy Which shall be for all people today in the City of David a savior has been born he is Christ the lord and this Will be a Sign to you You Will find him W in SW and l in a m [Música] to God in the [Música] to God in the [Música] the song lifed Every Every fear replacing with a Peace that only Heaven could be each Note seemed to speak directly to their hearts reminding them that the lowest places in the world did not matter and did not seem unworthy in the eyes of God The shepherds Who Had spent their lives uned and unseen were Now bathed in the light of Love Far greater than they could have Ever imagined did you guys See That the Angel and All the singing you guys heard that too yeah but but Why would God choose Us to see this Maybe god's Love does Reach down to the lowest to those who go on scen to those who feel humble the Angel he said he said about the City of David That's Bethlehem we must go the Angel said a savior has been born to Us to Us the shepherds the The ones Who Just Go onen You're right I think we should Go we we must Go you heard the Angel We have to go Let's go Let's go oha be to God the shepherds humbl yet filled with a New Found purpose set out to find the savior they Go not as men of Power or wealth but as humble shepherds caring the greatest news Ever given They are ordinary Yes but in this very moment They are extraordinary chosen to witness the miracles of god's Love and here in a humble stable the savior lies wrapped in cloes resting in a maj and Now Friends is not a Place nor a Place of glamour but a Place as simple as the shepherds themselves on you [Música] lord all Our hope in you lord all Our Trust in you lord all We want is you lord on you lord all Our hope in you [Música] lord all Our Trust in you lord all We want is you lord [Música] the lord is Our sh the lord is Our helper Oh Jesus lead Us and show Us the come closer Welcome here is this is this truly the savior the one the Angel spoke of Yes e This is the one that the Angel promised Us this Child is a gift from God and a light for all The People god's Love does not need to be it could be Found in places as simple as this and in lives as humble as yours God sees More Than the world sees he does not Look at your clothes or your title he sees the kindness in your heart The Love You show for others but but but the messiah a maj Just it doesn't make Any sense perhaps God Wanted it This Way Maybe he chose his Place for A Reason for Us to see this I'm nobody Only a Shepherd yet I am here in the presence of the messiah Why would God choose Someone like me to show them such a Wonder God came to this Place this stable to show that his Love Is for all even those who feel they have Nothing I feel like as If Everything That's happened to Us up To This Point has has prepared Us for this moment But I'm I'm I'm just no closer to understanding it You're right How Why would God want Us to see this perhaps It's true god's Love does Reach to the [Música] lowest in the stable e's heart is renewed he Still feels humble Still rough and dust but now he knows without a doubt that He's deeply loved and unseen but the very God he once questioned as a child at Last he understood God Had Always noticed [Música] him I can't Stay styling about this the messiah came for Us in the stable rejected by everybody Else but He's here for me for you I can't Ever forget about this He's here for He's a savior born for Us For Us all Go Now and share the Joy you F Tonight Let the world know that the savior has come here not in his Palace but among the humble the lowly for it is in the simplest places Thank you Thank you for all Us to be here I carry this moment with me forever and so Under a Silent Sky the shepherds carry the Memory of this night in their hearts knowing that they have witnessed something sacred in a humble stable among the lowest of men The highest Love Was revealed and god's wisdom bypasses the nobles and the scholars rests on the shepherds for god's wisdom takes the Nothing of the world to make them something What the mighty could not seen the humble understood and as they spread the news the world would never be the same Again Oh jus lead It's the mess mah mah here he was born my life is better And I like it better When I am following you Oh my life is better And I like it better When I following you Oh my life is better And I like it better When I am following you Oh my life is better And I like it better When I am following you [Música] and with that the She depart the stable their hearts overflowed with Joy While they spread the news the messiah birth ohra his steps lead him back home caring not only the Wonder of What he Had seen but the need to share it with the one Who Had tau him to believe mother well I've seen the messiah he came in the stable he wasn't born in no Palace he came for Us the humble i told you ezra the messiah would come he Cuz He loves you so much ezra the Angel he said he he came for Us For for Just Thank you exactly e God Will Always come in his Time buse he goes to those who need him the most Let's go spread the good news to all Parts of the world and with that we Come To understand that god's greatest gift did not come for The powerful Or the wise but to humble shepherds simple men that were willing to Open up their hearts and humble themselves Enough for God to receive Friends takes low of Show The highest and the greatest of things in this World and with this Friends I leave you and until we Meet Again Oh Jesus Was the [Música] way my life is better And I like it better When I am following you Oh my life is better And I like it better When I am following you [Música] following podemos dar otro aplauso [Música] [Aplausos] [Música] pienso que todos en algún [Música] momento nos hemos sentido como olvidados [Música] mucho tal vez nos comparamos a los demás y miramos de que somos muy diferentes de que somos muy pequeños comparados a otros tal vez sentimos de que nadie mira lo que hacemos pero yo quiero decirle aquellos que nos sentimos pequeños aquellos que nos sentimos olvidados son exactamente las personas que Dios está buscando para él poderlos usar el apóstol Pablo nos dice haya Pues en vosotros el mismo sentir que hubo en Cristo Jesús el cual siendo el Dios eterno el cual no se aferró a ser igual que Dios sino que se despojó de sí mismo y se hizo pequeño por nosotros y vino a los pequeños él todavía es pequeño él todavía es pequeño él todavía viene a los pequeños en una ocasión Elías se sentía pequeño se sentía solo y la Biblia nos dice que él se fue triste quebrantado de corazón a una cueva y le dijo dios Mátame mejor mejor má todo lo que hago de nada sirve y Dios se le apareció para mostrarle que Dios no obra solamente en las cosas grandes sino que él obra en las cosas pequeñas y le mostró un gran terremoto le mostró un gran viento y le mostró un gran fuego y se dio cuenta de que Dios no estaba en esas grandes cosas pero luego le mostró una pequeña suave voz pequeña y quieta voz y ahí estaba Dios Dios Estaba mostrando a el yo no solamente obro en las cosas grandes yo no me muevo solamente en las cosas enormes Yo me muevo en las cosas pequeñas y Dios todavía está pequeño y Dios todavía es una voz pequeña Dios todavía obra con Los pequeños era [Música] voz quieta y pequeña para mostrar de que Dios todavía permanece [Música] pequeño todavía pequeño diga todavía pequeño permanece pequeño Yo quiero decirle a cada uno de ustedes permanece pequeño así como él permanece pequeño tú permane pequeño yo pudiera decirte todas las razones porque eres grande yo pudiera decirte de que Dios te hizo una persona tan única [Música] porque Dios esconde sus cosas grandes en cosas pequeñas dice de que el sol es tan grande tan enorme pero no hace nada de ruido puede sacar miles de galones de Agua de la Tierra y hacer menos ruido que lo que nosotros hacemos cuando sacamos un galón de agua de una pompa una bomba porque Dios esconde las cosas grandes dentro de cosas pequeñas por eso Dios te hizo pequeñ por eso dios busca los peños dice permanece pequeño Oh es fácil creernos algo grande y pudiéramos hablar de Por qué somos gente grande delante de los ojos de Dios pero Dios no quiere Eso Dios quiere personas pequeñas yo me estaba recordando de mi propia vida cuando iba creciendo siempre era el raro verdaderamente yo era el raro no me juntaba con nadie todos tenían ropa bonita zapatos bonitos todos tenían buenas cosas para Navidad recibían grandes regalos yo recibía lo que agarraban allá en el lugar de donación Toa me recuerdo caminar a la escuela con zapatos rotos un suer siempre me cubría la cabeza con un Hood iba era raro y eso me enseñó una gran lección entre más pequeños podemos ser más Dios nos puede usar permanece pequeño es lo que Dios siempre me ha dicho a mi corazón Eso es lo que Dios siempre me ha recordado Tito No te creas nadie No te creas que eres importante recuerda entre más pequeño tú te puedas hacer más yo puedo usarte no busques títulos no busques grandes cosas en esta tierra si puedes ser más sencillo yo puedo manifestar en tu vida a veces me miro al lado de otros grandes ministros y digo miro todas mis fallas a ve me gusta ni presentarme la gente dice se presenta ni saluda viene es porque Dios siempre me ha dicho no busques un lugar importante en el momento que tú te creas importante Dios te va a quitar todo y yo te digo iglesia yo te digo a ti si eres un es tal vez eres el raro Tal vez Dios te dio un aguijón como el apóstol Pablo él podía haberse creído el más grande de todos él podría haber sido el más grande de todos él tenía más revelación que todos los apóstoles Pero él dijo para que yo no me engrandezca para que yo no me crea alguien grande me dio un aguijón para mantenerme pequeño lo segó lo tumbó del caballo Oh iglesia si pudiéramos bajarnos de nuestro caballo suficiente tiempo para que él pueda ayudarnos la razón que no nos puede ayudar que estamos en nuestro caballo todava nos creemos algo no te das cuenta Eso lo que Dios no quiere Él está buscando alguien que se sienta pequeño yal vez Dios te dio a ti un aguijón algunos aquí no pueden hablar bien yo digo Gracias Señor gracias porque pienso que si habláramos bien nos creyéramos alguno de ustedes Dios les dio algo raro algo que los hace sentirse raros el nerviosismo tal vez como se miran tal vez su cuerpo se siente raro vez ustedes se sienten menos que los demás eso es exactamente lo que Dios quiere es exactamente lo que Dios quiere por eso Dios te hizo raro yo me miro y miro señor he sido un tartamudo señor antes no podía ni hablar era tan callado y Dios me dijo Esto es lo que quiero quiero que te siempre recuerdes que eres pequeño porque en cuanto tú te creas algo Dios no te puede usar porque Dios Escoge a los pequeños a los publicanos a los pecadores tal vez tú dices tengo tantos errores he hecho tantos errores es caído una y otra y otra y otra y otra vez Dios no me puede usar y Dios dice Ese es el corazón que yo quiero aquel que sabe de que es poco para este mundo pero yo los voy a hacer grandes deje que Dios lo haga grande yo no quiero enaltecer a mí mismo si Dios haya gracia en uno que sea él el que lo haga Yo no quiero nada por mí mismo yo quiero que él me dé mi lugar yo quiero que él me enaltezca Yo quiero que sea su espíritu santo que la gente pueda mirar en una ocasión dicen que pasó el violinista más reconocido del mundo y agarró un violín en una condición de teid que estaba deteriorado con una sola cuerda y este violinista lo tomó y empezó a tocar con una sola cuerda empezó a hacer una melodía que nadie se esperaba la audiencia con el sonido de ese viol la audiencia empezó a emocionarse a tal punto donde aú lágrimas salieron de ellos por cómo estaba tocando este violinista al final todos lo aplaudieron todos estaban contentos pero se preguntaban Por qué tocó con un violín quebrado y le [Música] dijeron dijeron de él tocó con un violín quebrado para que la gloria no fuera del violín sino del violinista ese violín quebrado soy yo ese violín quebrado Eres Tú siempre has dicho por estoy tan quebrado Yo siempre me he preguntado por estoy tan quebrado por mi corazón siempre está dolido porque siempre estoy dich para que la gloria no sea del violín pero de aquel que lo tomó de aquel que lo escogió de aquel que puede hacer de un violín quebrado algo grande Oh gracias señor que la honra no es mía toda honra y toda Gloria es de él si algo bueno sale de m [Música] eso te digo iglesia tabernáculo voz de la verdad ministro músicos directores si quieres que Dios te use permanece pequeño que no te importe todos tus errores que solamente sirvan para recordarte él todavía puede usar un violín quebrado que no te importe que no puedes hablar que no tienes gramática que no sabes cómo expresarte d Dios Aquí está un violín quebrado que para ti sea toda honra y toda Gloria permanece pequeño permanece pequeño querido corazón aunque el mundo sea ruidoso aunque llame a lo grande [Música] orgulloso permanece pequeño donde crecen los urros callados donde las semillas de la verdad echan raíces y son reveladas permanece pequeño suelo esondido por Dios siempre conocido porque el humilde lo bajo lo sencillo está el tesoro que busca el altivo permanece pequeño porque el reino es a estos les pertenece a manos que sirven y corazones que agradecen los el cielo tocar Pero el grano de mostaza la montaña hará mudar permanece pequeño donde el amor tiene espacio para florecer donde el orgullo se disipa y la gracia puede crecer porque Dios levanta Los Humildes exalta Los sencillos y reúne a los pequeños para El banquete divino permanece pequeño y deja que su poder brille a través de actos simples y un corazón que camine el mundo puede buscar lo que pronto caerá pero la gloria eterna está en permanecer mientr que se Yo te invito a bajarte por un momento baja tu guardia ha un poco humilde en esta ma [Música] sientes mirando invito a ser humilde aunque sea estea porque sezo
