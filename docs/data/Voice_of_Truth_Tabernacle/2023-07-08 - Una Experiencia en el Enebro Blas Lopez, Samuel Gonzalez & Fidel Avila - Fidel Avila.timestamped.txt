[22:02] God bless you my brothers
[22:04] are you happy Brothers
[22:16] to do a service to the Lord
[22:19] foreign
[23:10] and Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah
[23:13] had done and with all how he had slain
[23:15] all the prophets with the sword in
[23:17] donces
[23:34] then Jezebel sent a messenger unto
[23:36] Elijah saying so let the gods do to me
[23:38] and more also if I may not thy life as
[23:40] the life of one of them by tomorrow
[23:42] about this time
[23:55] and when he saw that he arose and went
[23:58] for his life and came to Beersheba which
[24:00] belonged to Judah and left his servant
[24:02] there yes
[24:17] but he himself went a Day's Journey Into
[24:19] the Wilderness and came and sat down
[24:21] under a juniper tree and he requested
[24:23] for himself that he might die and said
[24:25] it is enough now oh Lord take away my
[24:28] life for I am not better than my father
[24:30] is
[24:39] and as he lay and slept under a juniper
[24:42] tree behold then an angel touched him
[24:44] and said unto him arise indeed
[24:53] is
[24:58] and he looked and behold there was a
[25:00] cake bacon on the coals and a cruise of
[25:02] water at his head and he did eat and
[25:04] drink and laid him down again
[25:15] and the angel of the Lord came again the
[25:18] second time and touched him and said
[25:19] arise indeed because the journey is too
[25:22] great
[25:33] and drink and went in the strength of
[25:36] that meat 40 days and 40 nights until he
[25:38] grabbed the Mount of god
[25:41] let's pray Brothers
[25:44] gracious Heavenly Father
[25:47] before your presence
[25:51] foreign
[27:01] and we'll continue with the topic
[27:09] an experience
[27:13] or under an experience under a junior
[27:21] Elijah had had a great Revival
[27:24] Hermanos
[27:29] he had a challenge there yes
[27:45] because I believe that God is
[27:49] he Vindicated
[27:53] that man
[28:16] he was uh
[28:57] wasn't mine foreign
[29:22] foreign
[30:22] Brothers
[31:14] as we read in the word of the Lord right
[31:18] again that she says although the gods do
[31:21] to me
[31:25] she just wanted to kill Elijah
[31:27] experience
[32:14] no other place
[32:20] amen my brother
[32:24] with the Lord Brothers
[32:27] Hermanos Brothers
[33:01] foreign
[34:00] many times when we come across
[34:03] for God to just take our lives
[34:08] I don't want to live
[34:11] this problem to disappeared
[34:14] let me tell you bro
[34:17] God isn't going to give you Allah
[34:23] God knows
[34:27] Elijah fell asleep
[34:31] here's the word Brothers
[34:57] many times why
[35:00] foreign
[35:47] in the message
[35:50] [Music]
[35:58] I believe that it was
[36:59] what is What is the encouragement
[37:13] because I'm still not done
[37:16] and that's how the Lord
[37:50] and why did he grab him because they
[37:52] would all come and eat the corners
[38:02] and he had him there for a long time
[38:07] that the winter time
[38:34] the prophecies
[38:47] when did
[38:48] there must be the Lord I'm excited
[38:53] oh Brothers
[39:11] God bless you
[39:14] [Applause]
[39:17] thank you
[39:19] Santos
[39:25] foreign
[40:37] it grows in that atmosphere
[40:42] amen and if verse 4 says like this
[40:45] Brothers
[40:46] but he himself went a Day's Journey Into
[40:49] the Wilderness
[40:54] and came and sat down under a juniper
[40:57] tree
[40:58] and he requested for himself that he
[41:01] might die
[41:03] and said it is enough now O Lord take
[41:07] away my life
[41:10] for I am not better than my fathers
[41:16] and as he lay and slept under a juniper
[41:19] tree
[41:21] behold then an angel touched him
[41:26] and said unto him
[41:28] arise and eat
[41:31] amen you may take your seats Brothers
[41:35] focus is on Elijah the prophet is
[41:39] diving into the word
[41:42] we know that Elijah was the prophet sent
[41:45] by God
[41:49] sent to preach to the people of Israel
[41:53] about repentance
[41:56] but also to bring the word of the Lord's
[41:59] judgments
[42:02] upon Israel
[42:04] because the people of Israel
[42:07] you see I've turned their backs on the
[42:09] Lord
[42:11] and they have broke the Covenant with
[42:13] the Lord
[42:15] this is due to the idolatry yes
[42:20] you know and one occasion in chapter 18
[42:25] like our brothers preached last week
[42:29] Elijah eventually stands up
[42:35] and the 450 prophets
[42:40] and we see God manifesting in Mount
[42:42] Carmen
[43:14] and he kills all the false prophets
[43:18] you see but in first the Kings chapter
[43:20] 19 verse 2 we can see
[43:24] we see that Queen Jezebel um
[43:28] after hearing that Elijah had slained
[43:30] all the false prophets
[43:34] as he becomes angry
[43:37] and trains to kill Elijah
[43:42] and the Bible foreign
[44:29] I believe I believe scared
[44:34] discouraged
[44:36] and at some points
[44:40] Elijah was so discouraged
[44:43] to the point that the Bible says
[44:47] that he prayed to God that he would take
[44:50] his life
[44:52] and you know looking into the term or
[44:55] meaning desert
[44:58] in Greek or in Hebrews
[45:03] it means unhabited Place uh
[45:23] amen brothers and I believe that just
[45:26] like Elijah
[45:29] each and every one of us
[45:32] as Christians in this world
[45:36] we will all go through through our own
[45:38] spiritual deserts
[45:42] you see many times do we like to think
[45:45] that by having crushed in our lives
[45:49] we're having a close relationship
[45:53] we all have to deal with problems
[45:56] we won't have to worry about the
[45:58] problems
[45:59] foreign
[46:25] each and every one of us
[46:29] we will
[46:35] go through problems
[46:38] we will go through our spiritual desert
[46:42] s
[46:44] we will go through times
[46:47] of Despair
[46:52] at times where it will be dark and
[46:54] lonely
[46:57] you see but in those deserts
[46:59] you see God can do marvelous things as
[47:02] well
[47:03] foreign
[49:14] Sacramento
[49:16] but as soon as we leave service
[49:20] we lose that momentum Brothers
[49:53] we can't get anything from the service
[49:57] foreign
[50:12] [Applause]
[50:25] so that we could realize
[50:28] your true friend is
[51:02] there will be times
[51:05] where it feels like we are rejected and
[51:07] alone
[51:09] there will be times
[51:14] where the voices of our friends
[51:20] there will be times
[51:22] where it feels like everyone is against
[51:24] us
[51:33] oh but our God says
[52:01] do everything you can
[52:04] to build the kingdom of God
[52:08] you see we can't admit this sometimes
[52:11] but we need to go through that desert
[52:18] because it seems like the youth is
[52:20] relaxing foreign
[52:36] you see in that place money will become
[52:40] worthless
[52:41] foreign
[53:52] God doesn't want cowards
[54:46] when it came to a showdown
[54:49] so he thought he was the only one in the
[54:52] nation who was still living for God
[54:58] and the King was going to put him under
[55:01] a trial
[55:02] s
[55:04] and they persecuted him
[55:07] and that little painted up Queen by the
[55:10] name of Jessica
[55:13] Strange's life
[55:15] and when he came to The Showdown
[55:20] Elijah possessed the gates of his
[55:22] enemies
[55:27] back to God again
[55:34] amen when Elijah was under that juniper
[55:37] tree
[55:39] I believe that he was at a point
[55:43] where he was in despair
[55:47] he thought that he couldn't do it
[55:49] anymore
[55:50] because he prayed to God he prayed to
[55:54] God he would take his own life
[55:58] I believe that Elijah fell alone
[56:03] knowing that the king and queen were
[56:05] again
[56:08] you see I believe that for a moment
[56:10] Elijah looked at his circumstances
[56:15] that he was alone
[56:17] and sometimes the devil
[56:20] wants us to look at our circumstances
[56:28] from our true purpose
[56:37] we start losing brothers
[56:40] because God is this because the devil is
[56:43] distracting us
[56:44] with the things of this world
[56:47] you see I remember that our brother
[56:49] Kayla Perez who inside
[56:52] when I look around the church
[56:55] I see so many people Bound by chains
[57:01] chains of circumstances
[57:05] chains of problems
[57:10] of school the Escuela and the saddest
[57:13] part about it is
[57:15] that it's become normal to all of us
[57:20] to be bound by chains
[57:23] maybe tonight
[57:26] maybe tonight we are changed
[57:32] we're chained by the same routines of
[57:34] coming to church
[57:40] over and over and over
[57:42] you see but tonight God wants to break
[57:46] those chains
[57:54] we have to wake up
[57:57] and look in the mirror and say I am a
[58:01] child of God
[58:08] [Applause]
[58:10] I was blind
[58:14] I am one that believes the message
[58:18] you see Brothers
[58:20] we will have to suffer in this Christian
[58:22] works
[58:30] you see our brother Brandon said and I'm
[58:32] foreign
[59:36] Elijah thought he was alone you see but
[59:40] the angel of the Lord
[59:43] rise
[59:45] for the journey is too great for you
[59:51] tonight God wants to wake us up
[59:54] and say I'm not done with you yes
[1:00:01] I'm just getting started with you
[1:00:03] oh Brothers we lifted ourselves we limit
[1:00:08] ourselves
[1:00:09] because we look at our problems we look
[1:00:13] at our circumstances
[1:00:18] and what he says
[1:00:21] Elijah might have been alone
[1:00:25] but God pursued him in that desert
[1:00:30] and you know what you call that is
[1:00:33] the grace of God
[1:00:35] no matter where the problems are
[1:00:37] important
[1:00:39] no matter how distant we are
[1:00:43] always there
[1:00:46] but he won't stop
[1:00:48] until you bow
[1:00:55] and say you are the true Lord
[1:00:59] and the King of Kings
[1:01:15] stronger
[1:01:19] [Applause]
[1:01:26] una experience an experience in the
[1:01:29] Juniper
[1:01:33] how many have had an experience
[1:01:38] you haven't had an experience
[1:01:41] don't worry
[1:01:50] you know what's being spoken of
[1:01:54] this is the scripture says
[1:01:58] that Elijah went through the desert
[1:02:03] and that he sat under a juniper tree
[1:02:07] on a good Sunday
[1:02:11] from having a good service on a Sunday
[1:02:14] morning
[1:02:16] there's a park that exists
[1:02:20] we're gonna bring this down a little
[1:02:23] there's a park
[1:02:27] after a great victory that Elijah
[1:02:30] there was a uh
[1:02:55] he is taking it all in Domingo
[1:03:02] after a good song
[1:03:03] There is a good uh
[1:03:06] you know what I'm referring referring to
[1:03:10] Domingo after a good Sunday
[1:03:12] there's a Monday
[1:03:15] afternoon
[1:03:21] [Music]
[1:03:33] we run as cows
[1:03:40] and you
[1:03:42] begin to cry
[1:04:07] that's why sometimes I just watch myself
[1:04:10] [Music]
[1:04:37] thanks to God for that Juniper
[1:04:42] this is all God's people need to go to
[1:04:46] go
[1:04:50] it's a place he was so discouraged that
[1:04:53] he didn't know what to do
[1:04:55] where Elijah was under the Juniper
[1:04:59] very discouraging
[1:05:02] how many of us
[1:05:04] we don't even want to come to church
[1:05:23] some people
[1:05:25] foreign
[1:05:59] well the problem lies
[1:06:06] [Applause]
[1:06:10] the word discouraged negative thoughts
[1:06:12] about himself
[1:06:13] and your environment
[1:06:18] irritability and changes in Moon
[1:06:23] your Elijah was
[1:06:28] to die
[1:06:31] you know I'm going to touch on a few
[1:06:33] points here
[1:06:35] I'd like to take it from this
[1:06:37] perspective
[1:06:39] why did Elijah run porque why
[1:06:45] was it because Jezebel threatened him
[1:06:52] in First Kings 19 10.
[1:06:59] and he said I have been very zealous for
[1:07:01] the Lord of God of hosts
[1:07:06] for the children of those who have
[1:07:08] forsaken thy Covenant
[1:07:10] look what Elijah's telling God here
[1:07:31] for the people of Israel to believe
[1:07:34] that's good Brother come on
[1:07:39] Miracles amongst us
[1:07:42] and the people won't believe
[1:08:16] [Applause]
[1:08:17] [Music]
[1:08:19] I'm happy for that Brothers I'm happy
[1:08:21] because of that
[1:08:24] because I was able to see it
[1:08:29] I can see it
[1:08:36] sometimes our expectations
[1:08:40] they're not the ones that we just we'd
[1:08:43] like
[1:08:44] I don't know if you can identify it this
[1:08:46] evening
[1:08:47] sometimes you look at your life
[1:08:52] and it's not what you'd like it to be
[1:08:55] and that's how Elijah
[1:08:58] his expectations
[1:09:11] that is what it's telling us here when
[1:09:13] he was in the cave
[1:09:16] it was the opposite my mind
[1:09:23] sometimes we've been years in church
[1:09:29] and our expectations
[1:09:31] there's no we're not trying to get
[1:09:33] better there's no growth
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:39] expectations aren't met
[1:09:45] my mind
[1:09:48] or sometimes as a couple
[1:09:52] we get married
[1:09:59] and time goes by yeah
[1:10:03] and your expectations aren't what you
[1:10:05] thought they were
[1:10:07] doing
[1:10:09] if your husband isn't that many times
[1:10:17] your expectations
[1:10:20] and that's how Elijah was
[1:10:26] he thought
[1:10:30] I'm on good
[1:10:34] we can speak a lot on there
[1:10:40] this is
[1:10:45] in verse 2 it says then Jezebel said
[1:10:49] a messenger unto Elijah
[1:10:53] yeah
[1:10:55] sometimes we feel uh discouraged
[1:11:00] when we allow the devil
[1:11:04] to come and sow thoughts in our minds
[1:11:10] because Jezebel simply told him
[1:11:43] that's right all right brother I might
[1:11:47] yeah
[1:11:50] sometimes we allow the devs
[1:11:53] simply because he threats
[1:11:56] and he has no rights
[1:12:11] so come and put a sickness
[1:12:14] God doesn't allow him
[1:12:19] he has no right
[1:12:24] that always allows things
[1:12:28] [Music]
[1:12:29] true
[1:12:33] that's why sometimes we're discouraged
[1:12:37] we allow the devil to play with us
[1:12:42] for them to go down and then they're
[1:12:46] manifested
[1:12:49] another point I'd like to make or I
[1:12:52] liked
[1:12:53] sincere man I'm trying to bring it
[1:12:55] simply Brothers to see you simply
[1:13:01] another point I see here
[1:13:05] is wounds
[1:13:09] Elijah was wounded
[1:13:13] he was wounded yes he was
[1:13:16] because he thought
[1:13:19] que foreign
[1:13:38] yeah
[1:13:40] and those same people
[1:13:44] we're trying to look for him to kill him
[1:13:49] let's speak a little bit more here
[1:13:52] the Lord calls us
[1:13:57] to work in in the vineyard of the Lord
[1:14:00] in his work
[1:14:03] and the people come much
[1:14:09] they hurt
[1:14:12] do you not think that our pastor has
[1:14:14] been hurt many times
[1:14:19] you think that he has never been in a
[1:14:23] juniper
[1:14:24] he is a man
[1:14:26] he is a man
[1:14:32] and there are times that people are
[1:14:34] going to come
[1:14:40] to do something for the for the work of
[1:14:42] the lord
[1:14:44] and there are times when people even
[1:14:46] make faces and they make faces
[1:14:55] you're not in the right place
[1:15:05] that are wounded
[1:15:24] and shoots it at you hmm
[1:15:29] they shoot a dart at you
[1:15:33] no you don't want to do anything
[1:15:37] be sitting there on the bed because
[1:15:39] you're wounded
[1:15:41] you're wounded
[1:15:44] and that's how Elijah was he was wounded
[1:15:49] [Music]
[1:15:51] but I don't want to get to them
[1:15:57] I want to get to the glory of the Lord
[1:16:00] put marks on my body with marks on my
[1:16:05] soul
[1:16:05] of what I fought for
[1:16:12] what good is it to get there as a coward
[1:16:17] [Music]
[1:16:22] I wanna go I want to leave
[1:16:27] everything on the table
[1:16:33] although they heard us
[1:16:35] they hurt us badly
[1:16:40] sometimes people come without mercies
[1:16:43] they don't have any Mercy
[1:16:49] thanks be to God for a juniper
[1:16:57] now what should we do
[1:17:02] when we find ourselves
[1:17:04] where we're all wounded
[1:17:07] where we don't know where to go
[1:17:13] dios God
[1:17:17] Elias told Elijah
[1:17:21] bete
[1:17:24] go to Mount Horeb
[1:17:31] ird you know where Mount Arab is
[1:17:36] it is the Mountain of God
[1:17:41] he tells them go to the origins
[1:17:45] go to the beginning
[1:17:52] when we start in the way of the Lord
[1:17:55] foreign
[1:18:21] piano
[1:18:26] even then I fulfilled myself
[1:18:29] because I know what I can do when you
[1:18:33] know what you call it doesn't matter
[1:18:36] what they do for you
[1:18:40] you know what you were born for
[1:18:43] glory to God that's good
[1:18:48] amen
[1:18:55] and he runs to his word
[1:19:05] come forward

[1:19:15] that there came an earthquake

[1:19:34] but then it says that there came a tiny
[1:19:37] a small gentlemen
[1:19:40] brother sometimes
[1:19:43] that's what Elijah thought
[1:19:47] that he was alone
[1:19:51] the God was working in silence

[1:52:57] turn back because I wanna see my Jesus
[1:53:02] someday
[1:53:04] I've Got My Mind Made Up and I won't
[1:53:09] turn back because I want
[1:53:17] to
[1:53:22] be my Jesus someday
[1:53:26] goodbye world
