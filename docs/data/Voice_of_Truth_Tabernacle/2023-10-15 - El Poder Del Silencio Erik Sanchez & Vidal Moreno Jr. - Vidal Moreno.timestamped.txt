[34:48] 53 verse
[34:55] 7

[36:22] name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[36:24] amen may be seated
[36:30] this is the foundation
[36:36] service and our subject continues
[36:38] conquering
[36:41] ourselves and with brother
[36:45] VI we have this
[36:49] subtitle and we have titled our message
[36:51] the power of
[36:54] Silence now I'm going to start with this
[36:57] with this
[36:59] reflection there was a
[37:03] farmer that had a clock or was that he
[37:07] appreciated so much and in his
[37:11] farm this
[37:13] farmer lost this
[37:16] watch he spends
[37:20] time trying to find this precious object
[37:22] for him in the
[37:25] hay and every corner of the
[37:29] barn but he is not
[37:34] successful and then he sees a group of
[37:36] kids playing outside his
[37:37] barn and tells them
[37:41] children if you can help me find this
[37:45] watch I will reward
[37:48] you the children
[37:51] obviously when they heard that they'd be
[37:53] rewarded they go and get in this
[37:58] barn and they look begin to look for it
[38:02] in the hay in every
[38:05] corner and they make a
[38:09] mess and the hours go
[38:14] by and these children do not
[38:17] succeed they began to be
[38:20] fussy and
[38:21] leave they leave the
[38:24] barn until the children that were left
[38:28] without success they leave
[38:32] also and they couldn't find this
[38:34] watch the
[38:36] farmer was going to give
[38:40] up and when he was closing the doors
[38:42] from the
[38:45] barn one of the children stand in front
[38:48] of him and tell
[38:50] him give me a new
[38:53] opportunity to look for the watch
[38:57] and the farmer said
[39:00] well nothing's going to happen if I give
[39:02] him another chance and he says go and he
[39:06] closed the
[39:09] doors after 10 15 minutes this boy comes
[39:13] out with the
[39:15] watch and the farmer tells him with
[39:19] joy to see this precious object that
[39:23] was how did you find it and the boy
[39:28] said I didn't do
[39:30] anything all I did was sit down I stayed
[39:34] still in
[39:36] silence and I began to hear tick the
[39:41] ticking of the
[39:43] watch and that
[39:45] sound I began to follow
[39:47] it and that's where I found the
[39:55] watch the power of
[39:58] Silence has power if we
[40:03] learn to be
[40:05] quiet to stay still without a doubt that
[40:09] in the silence we will
[40:12] find what many times we
[40:16] lose look the secrets of Silence a
[40:21] mind and a peaceful Spirit can think
[40:26] better than a
[40:27] mind and a and a spirit that is
[40:32] uneasy here and
[40:34] now let's
[40:37] allow a few moments of Silence in our
[40:39] lives in our spirit in our mind
[40:44] sometimes all that we need is to relax
[40:49] be
[40:50] still stay in
[40:52] silence and
[40:55] hear let's stop from always that our
[40:59] mind our spirit our
[41:04] soul let's allow it to have a few
[41:06] minutes of silence because a mind a
[41:10] spirit a soul that is at peace that can
[41:16] meditate is better than a mind and a
[41:19] spirit that is
[41:22] stressed in
[41:24] silence it's often
[41:27] in the
[41:28] place the place where God is waiting for
[41:31] us so we can accomplish to hear
[41:37] him Psalms 46 10 says you know it be
[41:42] still and know that I am
[41:46] God now
[41:49] look because
[41:52] God not only is God in the
[41:55] Thunder not only is God in the
[41:58] praise not only is God in the
[42:00] shout not only in the
[42:04] noise not only is he in the
[42:06] valley not only is he in the
[42:08] mountain is in silence
[42:11] also because he is a god of Silence
[42:14] also the power of Silence gives
[42:18] trust but trust in
[42:20] God
[42:23] only and
[42:25] truly
[42:27] can be seen in God's
[42:29] hands and above
[42:33] trials that we can have in this life as
[42:36] human
[42:38] beings have been
[42:40] able to be
[42:43] silent even in these complicated
[42:46] situations Luther Martin Luther King
[42:49] said
[42:50] this at the
[42:54] end we remember not the words of our
[42:58] enemies but the Silence of our friends
[43:02] and that's the truth a man
[43:07] look when God is
[43:11] silent it's because something great is
[43:13] about to
[43:16] happen is Isaiah
[43:20] said a virgin shall
[43:25] conceive between the New and Old
[43:28] Testament 400 years
[43:30] pass where God stayed
[43:34] silent why because something great
[43:36] was but our
[43:38] problem is that we cannot
[43:41] wait we get
[43:43] desperate and in that
[43:46] time in the time between the New and Old
[43:49] Testament the
[43:51] people got desperate brother
[43:54] Alex they made their own religion
[43:57] they confused
[43:59] themselves that's the
[44:02] problem but always may
[44:07] God anytime that God stays still silence
[44:11] is because something great is about to
[44:16] happen and we have a great example there
[44:19] was a man that was
[44:21] oppressed that humbled himself and did
[44:24] not open his mouth and like a
[44:27] lamb straight to the slaughter house and
[44:31] like a sheep
[44:33] also did not open her
[44:37] mouth before its
[44:40] shearers this person did not open their
[44:49] mouth our brother from no Mexico was
[44:51] preaching on Wednesday Enrique brother
[44:55] Enrique
[44:56] [Music]
[45:00] a lot of what he spoke
[45:04] about it really got to
[45:07] me
[45:09] look when the Lord Jesus
[45:12] Christ they taking him
[45:15] prisoner before
[45:18] pilot pilot says
[45:22] speak what do you have to say against
[45:24] yourself because they accuse you our
[45:28] brother Bram
[45:29] said he closed his
[45:32] mouth and didn't say
[45:34] anything he stayed in
[45:40] silence when
[45:42] he when they're taking
[45:45] him after having him
[45:48] been and they begin to strike him they
[45:52] bind his hands those hands that healed
[45:55] kill the
[45:57] sick were now in
[45:59] binds and they punish him
[46:02] now but he never
[46:05] complained he never opened his mouth
[46:09] after other
[46:11] men they make a crown of for and put it
[46:15] on his
[46:17] head and they make wounds in his head
[46:20] and he stays still he doesn't say
[46:23] anything he does not open his mouth and
[46:26] other soldiers and they bind his
[46:29] eyes and they beat his head and they
[46:32] tell him you that are a Seer you that
[46:36] are a prophet tell us who hit
[46:40] you but he did not open his mouth and
[46:44] stayed in
[46:46] silent when he's carrying that cross
[46:48] brother Bram
[46:51] says cross was not like this wood here
[46:54] no it was not smooth
[46:57] it was a rough W it was
[47:01] rough a wood that that hurts and
[47:04] wounds but he didn't say anything he did
[47:07] not open his
[47:10] mouth and that's how it
[47:13] was that's how he went to
[47:24] Calvary
[47:27] it's at the
[47:30] cross when he is being
[47:38] crucified where he gives seven
[47:45] Expressions we don't know the order of
[47:47] them but they're like
[47:49] this the first one was
[47:52] father forgive them for they know not
[47:55] what they
[47:56] already
[47:59] crucified and then he answers to the
[48:03] thief truly I
[48:06] say today you will be with me in
[48:10] paradise and then he tells John the
[48:13] Beloved disciple
[48:14] son behold your mother mother behold
[48:19] your
[48:21] son then he says my God my God
[48:27] why have Thou forsaken me and then he
[48:30] says I'm
[48:32] thirsty and they gave him
[48:36] vinegar he did not open his mouth for
[48:38] anything
[48:39] else then he
[48:41] says it is
[48:44] finished and at the end he says
[48:48] father I command my spirit in your
[48:53] hands those were the words he spoke you
[48:56] know
[48:58] brother he conquered in silence many
[49:02] times we want to
[49:04] conquer in the disorder in the
[49:08] noise for the people to see
[49:11] us we have not conquered in the silence
[49:15] the Lord Jesus Christ never opened his
[49:17] mou to curse or
[49:21] complain he took his
[49:23] cross he knew it had to be
[49:26] he conquered in silence and when he went
[49:29] to
[49:30] the he had conquered already his
[49:34] flesh he had conquered
[49:36] this he had already conquered two
[49:40] kingdoms spiritual real and the the
[49:44] natural realm but first of
[49:46] all he had to conquer himself in
[49:54] silence
[50:02] Matthew 66
[50:05] reads but thou when thou
[50:08] prayest enter into thy
[50:11] closet shut thy
[50:13] door pray to thy
[50:16] father which is in secret and thy
[50:20] father which see in
[50:23] secret shall reward thee open
[50:28] and sometimes we're
[50:30] backwards we want to be rewarded in
[50:33] public we want to conquer in
[50:36] public but we're not
[50:38] able to get into our secret place close
[50:42] that
[50:43] door bend the
[50:45] knee and Conquer in
[50:47] silence and let
[50:51] him let him
[50:54] speak
[50:57] I'll be closing with
[51:01] this in the message hear his
[51:06] voice preach
[51:10] 1958 brother random
[51:13] says here he's speaking about
[51:16] Moses but this called my
[51:22] attention and we won't stay quiet 10
[51:25] minutes
[51:27] so God can speak to
[51:31] us with all the rumble and Bumble we
[51:34] have on this
[51:37] day and yet Moses after 40 years stood
[51:43] there and in that presence of that
[51:47] bush and that one voice that called him
[51:50] Watch what it
[51:53] says he knew more about God in five
[51:56] minutes after
[52:01] that then all the 80 years of training
[52:04] had taught him
[52:06] look if
[52:09] only we could
[52:11] stay
[52:12] silent still and
[52:15] silence we would learn more from our
[52:18] beloved
[52:20] God than what we've
[52:22] learned through our lives
[52:28] that made him a different
[52:31] man it'll make a different man and woman
[52:36] out if you'll just stand still long
[52:39] enough to hear his voice like
[52:42] Samuel stand
[52:45] still don't be
[52:47] excited if you want something of God ask
[52:52] him then stand still and listen
[52:57] see what he's going to say about
[53:00] it just open your heart
[53:05] say what about it Lord
[53:08] Jesus just stay
[53:11] there if he doesn't
[53:13] answer the first five
[53:16] hours then wait
[53:19] another if he doesn't answer
[53:22] today he'll answer
[53:24] tomorrow
[53:25] this
[53:27] week next
[53:29] week
[53:32] Hew hear his voice speak back in your
[53:35] heart and
[53:40] say yes I'm the Lord that Health thee
[53:44] then it is all over
[53:48] then it's settled then
[53:53] see I'm the the Lord who forgives thy
[53:57] sins now go and sin no more I don't
[54:00] condemn
[54:01] you then you can go
[54:04] free you're all
[54:06] right if we can only
[54:10] keep in
[54:12] silence and we give him the
[54:18] opportunity I
[54:22] believe that we cannot conquer ourselves
[54:28] ourselves if first of
[54:30] all we don't give God the
[54:33] opportunity to hear him to hear him in
[54:41] silence because not only can you conquer
[54:43] in
[54:45] public the
[54:47] majority and the greatest conquering is
[54:51] in
[54:52] silence God bless you Breen
[54:59] God bless
[55:01] you God bless
[55:05] the you know Sister Vicki in

[56:10] congregate in a
[56:14] basement it was actually two
[56:17] basements and then we got we got to this
[56:19] uh we got we got to have a little
[56:22] school it's an old school
[56:25] and it was
[56:27] cold I remember uh we used to be able to
[56:30] see our
[56:34] breath and and you know it was it was
[56:37] amazing because it it never stopped us
[56:39] from serving the
[56:41] lord I we'd have our
[56:44] blankets my wife you know she gets cold
[56:46] really
[56:48] easy and we couldn't even go to the
[56:51] bathroom because the water was
[56:53] frozen and uh you know bathroom is off
[56:58] limits but there we were serving the
[57:01] lord and I I I never want to get to a
[57:05] place uh you know where I'm too big to
[57:07] go
[57:09] somewhere amen amen you know we don't
[57:12] matter how big our church
[57:14] is you know I don't believe that we
[57:16] serve a
[57:18] God you know that won't go to the the
[57:20] most humblest of
[57:22] places to the most humblest of places
[57:28] you know he he he'll he'll just he he'll
[57:30] go wherever you know there's a soul
[57:31] that's crying
[57:33] out you know and that's a that's a big a
[57:36] big uh you know that's that's one of the
[57:38] silent things you know that God
[57:41] does you know and and that's the God
[57:43] that I serve
[57:44] amen let us go to Joshua chapter
[57:49] 6 you know they're just beautiful
[57:50] memories you know I never want to
[57:53] forget
[57:56] Joshua 6
[58:00] ver8 and it reads like
[58:02] this and it came to and it came to pass
[58:05] when Joshua had spoken unto the people
[58:08] that the seven priests bearing the seven
[58:10] trumpets of rams horns passed on before
[58:12] the Lord and blew with the trumpets and
[58:14] the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord
[58:16] followed
[58:23] them
[58:29] and the armed men went before the
[58:30] priests that blew with the trumpets and
[58:33] the reward came after the ark the the
[58:37] the priests going on and blowing with
[58:39] the
[58:50] trumpets and Joshua had commanded the
[58:52] people saying you shall not shout nor
[58:55] make any noise with your
[59:05] voice neither shall any word proceed out
[59:07] of your
[59:09] mouth until the day I bid you to
[59:14] shout then shall you
[59:17] shout uh you know when we uh talk about
[59:21] silence you know we're talking about
[59:23] conquering ourselves
[59:27] you know in the
[59:29] foundation and uh you know when when we
[59:32] think about those
[59:34] things you know and and and the warfare
[59:36] that's going
[59:38] on you know a lot of people think that
[59:40] Warfare is all about screaming and
[59:45] shouting and uh you know you you think
[59:47] about when you think about
[59:49] it you know there is a lot of
[59:52] screaming there is a lot of shouting
[59:56] you know there's a lot of wounded
[59:57] people and there's people that act like
[59:59] they're
[1:00:01] wounded you know but you know the point
[1:00:04] is it's just there's just a lot of
[1:00:07] noise you know but uh I believe I serve
[1:00:10] a
[1:00:11] God you know he doesn't he doesn't need
[1:00:13] to make a lot of
[1:00:15] noise you know to to to
[1:00:18] win amen amen you know my my God can
[1:00:21] just he he he can stay
[1:00:23] silent you know because he's he's not
[1:00:26] worried about who he
[1:00:29] is amen amen he he knows who he
[1:00:32] is he's not gonna talk just to
[1:00:35] talk you know and I believe his children
[1:00:38] should be the same
[1:00:39] way you know I believe that we talk a
[1:00:42] whole lot a lot of
[1:00:44] times you know and we talk so
[1:00:47] much because you know we like to hear
[1:00:51] ourselves you know but in all reality
[1:00:55] you know when you talk a whole
[1:00:56] lot you know it just shows how insecure
[1:01:00] you may
[1:01:02] be amen amen how many believe that you
[1:01:06] know some people like to hear
[1:01:09] themselves you know and they put off a
[1:01:10] fight for
[1:01:13] everything it doesn't matter how simple
[1:01:15] it
[1:01:16] is you know they put up a
[1:01:19] fight amen amen but you know I want to
[1:01:22] read what brother brandham says
[1:01:25] you know uh he he says this he says look
[1:01:29] at
[1:01:30] Elijah he says look at Elicia that
[1:01:32] followed
[1:01:33] him he says look at John the Baptist in
[1:01:36] his
[1:01:37] day he says look at Paul when all had
[1:01:41] forsaken
[1:01:42] him he still
[1:01:45] stood because he had met
[1:01:48] God he he heard a voice speaking to him
[1:01:51] one
[1:01:52] day he says look at John Wesley
[1:01:55] Martin Luther
[1:01:57] luvin men who's ever done anything for
[1:02:01] God been men who heard
[1:02:04] God and stood and and stood on their
[1:02:08] convictions listened and
[1:02:11] waited it don't make any difference what
[1:02:13] the rest
[1:02:15] says they wait till they hear
[1:02:19] God amen amen it says and then he says
[1:02:22] in the next quote or the next says you
[1:02:24] know great
[1:02:26] things don't make much noise did you
[1:02:30] ever think of that you know the sun can
[1:02:32] draw 10 million barrels of water with
[1:02:35] less
[1:02:39] noise then we can pump a glass full of a
[1:02:42] glass full out of a
[1:02:46] pump it says great things usually move
[1:02:51] silently did you ever hear the planets
[1:02:53] turning around around one
[1:02:57] another says no but how great is
[1:03:00] it did you ever hear the day
[1:03:05] break and yet it scatters all the
[1:03:09] darkness and it's so
[1:03:11] silent it don't even wake us
[1:03:14] up but it scatters all the
[1:03:18] night could you you imagine that how
[1:03:21] great of a God we have
[1:03:25] you know what he brother brandham says
[1:03:27] that when he spoke the world into
[1:03:30] existence that there wasn't there wasn't
[1:03:32] a whole lot of
[1:03:33] noise you know and and you know you may
[1:03:37] say you know maybe because he understood
[1:03:39] it
[1:03:40] all you know and he did you know but I
[1:03:44] believe you know that as Sons and
[1:03:47] Daughters of
[1:03:48] God you may not have to you may not
[1:03:51] understand it
[1:03:53] all you know but you don't have to
[1:03:56] understand it
[1:03:57] all in order to believe it all you know
[1:04:00] I believe you know that if you
[1:04:03] believe you know that that God that God
[1:04:07] has ordained this place for
[1:04:09] us you don't have to wonder how he did
[1:04:13] it you just got to believe and know that
[1:04:16] he did
[1:04:17] it amen you know there's a lot of people
[1:04:21] when they don't understand
[1:04:22] something you know don't want to do it
[1:04:26] so they start putting up a
[1:04:29] fuz you know and and they start fighting
[1:04:31] about this and
[1:04:33] that when all
[1:04:35] reality if you knew the god that you
[1:04:37] claim to
[1:04:40] know then you would just do what he said
[1:04:43] to
[1:04:44] do that's exactly
[1:04:46] right we have come to a
[1:04:49] place know I hope this church never gets
[1:04:51] to a
[1:04:53] place you have to understand
[1:04:56] everything in order to do
[1:04:59] something amen amen you know I believe
[1:05:03] uh that when these people when the
[1:05:05] people of Israel you know they had had a
[1:05:08] great
[1:05:09] Victory you know they had crossed the
[1:05:11] Red Sea you see they had come into the
[1:05:13] promised
[1:05:14] land you see and I believe that they
[1:05:17] were they were
[1:05:19] rejoicing but you know then they hit a
[1:05:22] wall they went they they looked at
[1:05:25] Jericho how they saw the great biggest
[1:05:27] walls they ever
[1:05:30] seen and I believe that a lot of them
[1:05:33] got real
[1:05:35] quiet you know after that they had seen
[1:05:38] these
[1:05:39] walls because even
[1:05:42] Joshua oh went to go take a
[1:05:46] walk amen amen because a lot of
[1:05:50] times even the leader doesn't have all
[1:05:53] the answers
[1:05:55] I believe that that's why you got to get
[1:05:57] quiet a lot of
[1:06:00] times I believe our pastor many
[1:06:03] times he don't make decisions just
[1:06:05] because he
[1:06:07] thinks he's got to go to his to his to
[1:06:10] his
[1:06:12] place he's got to go into that secret
[1:06:16] chamber where he has to take
[1:06:19] counsel he has to be one
[1:06:22] onone and he has to face the
[1:06:27] almighty trust me I believe that the
[1:06:30] people
[1:06:31] know when a man of
[1:06:34] God has been with the
[1:06:37] almighty you ain't going to fool the
[1:06:40] people you know sometimes you can fool
[1:06:43] your mom you can fool your dad you can
[1:06:47] fool the
[1:06:48] brother but you are never going to
[1:06:51] God that you are not going to be able to
[1:06:54] lie to him knows exactly what you're
[1:06:58] [Music]
[1:07:00] doing he knows those
[1:07:05] things he
[1:07:07] knows you know
[1:07:10] faith faith is
[1:07:13] silent brother brand says faith is
[1:07:17] silent Faith doesn't have to make a
[1:07:19] whole lot of
[1:07:20] noise because Faith knows where it
[1:07:23] stands
[1:07:25] amen
[1:07:27] amen I
[1:07:29] believe that when Joshua took his
[1:07:34] walk to to seek counsel from the
[1:07:39] Lord he was by
[1:07:42] himself he was like Lord what are we
[1:07:44] going to
[1:07:46] do we've run into a
[1:07:50] wall we don't know what's on the other
[1:07:53] side
[1:07:58] believe a lot of
[1:08:01] times we don't even
[1:08:03] know what the enemy on the other side
[1:08:06] looks
[1:08:09] like because of the
[1:08:12] walls amen amen and you know the way
[1:08:16] that the Lord
[1:08:18] works it's just beyond my
[1:08:22] understanding you know I just got got to
[1:08:24] believe
[1:08:25] it you know and the council that Joshua
[1:08:30] receives from the
[1:08:32] Lord is to start start
[1:08:36] walking you know just start
[1:08:38] marching you know just start marching
[1:08:40] around this
[1:08:44] city it almost looked like Child's
[1:08:49] Play you know that when these people
[1:08:51] might have poked their head out
[1:08:55] you know they what are they
[1:08:58] doing what what are they doing out
[1:09:01] there they may say the same thing about
[1:09:04] you but what do he do going to
[1:09:07] church go to church every
[1:09:12] Sunday what what's happening
[1:09:14] there it's
[1:09:18] ridiculous in the eyes of the
[1:09:21] unbeliever it may seem ridiculous to you
[1:09:26] at the moment but God said to do
[1:09:30] it and they R away and they went around
[1:09:32] the first
[1:09:35] day sir and the trumpet was sounding the
[1:09:38] whole
[1:09:40] time and the trumpet hasn't stopped
[1:09:42] sounding
[1:09:44] amen the gospel still being
[1:09:47] preached and you know you come to church
[1:09:51] you may hear the same thing
[1:09:54] the next
[1:09:55] Sunday and then the next
[1:09:58] Sunday you may still feel sick the next
[1:10:02] Sunday but you still keep
[1:10:05] going you see because it it seems
[1:10:09] ridiculous that that the people would
[1:10:12] conquer this
[1:10:14] way amen amen it seem
[1:10:20] foolish just like the way the the Bible
[1:10:22] says
[1:10:24] you know how the the gospel the
[1:10:26] preaching of the Gospel seems fo like
[1:10:30] foolishness but we know but we know that
[1:10:34] we've
[1:10:35] seen we've seen the hand of the
[1:10:39] almighty amongst
[1:10:41] us only goes before
[1:10:45] us behind
[1:10:47] us we have we have we have
[1:10:52] backing that we have
[1:10:56] and I believe that this isn't this isn't
[1:11:00] it having a big
[1:11:02] church that's not
[1:11:05] it if you think that's
[1:11:07] it got something else
[1:11:10] coming I'm not just expecting a big
[1:11:14] church God to do greater
[1:11:18] things this is just the
[1:11:21] beginning you see this was the first the
[1:11:24] First
[1:11:25] wall but this was the first wall that
[1:11:28] Israel had to
[1:11:31] face amen
[1:11:34] amen I'm closing
[1:11:39] now and they go around
[1:11:42] once twice three four five
[1:11:51] six Maybe you haven't seen a
[1:11:56] change in your
[1:11:58] life you still got to keep
[1:12:01] believing amen amen see we're not
[1:12:04] working on our
[1:12:06] time and we and we saw that with the
[1:12:10] church we work on God's
[1:12:12] time you see because when I when I was
[1:12:16] young I was waiting for the time that I
[1:12:18] could grow
[1:12:20] up you know I was just quiet I wouldn't
[1:12:22] say a whole lot
[1:12:24] but I was just waiting for the
[1:12:26] moment and you know God's just waiting
[1:12:29] for that
[1:12:30] moment where you can just be still you
[1:12:34] can just be
[1:12:35] silence and you can begin to
[1:12:38] grow because that's what God
[1:12:41] wants he wants you to
[1:12:43] grow he wants you to grow in the things
[1:12:45] of the
[1:12:47] Lord because he was not going to give us
[1:12:49] this
[1:12:51] church acting like a bunch of little
[1:12:53] kids
[1:12:55] like he wants
[1:12:56] maturity he want the only way you'll
[1:12:59] ever get up someplace with
[1:13:02] God is when you get
[1:13:05] silent amen
[1:13:08] Amen brother brandham says
[1:13:14] this he says this in the message of the
[1:13:17] reaction to an
[1:13:21] action he says but when real faith has
[1:13:24] caught the
[1:13:28] vision but when real faith has caught
[1:13:30] the
[1:13:32] vision it can keep
[1:13:35] silence and rest
[1:13:37] calmly because it knows it's going to
[1:13:40] happen don't forget
[1:13:44] that faith will rest with perfect
[1:13:48] Assurance no matter what the storms are
[1:13:52] saying
[1:13:55] Faith rest with
[1:13:57] Assurance faith can take it stand upon a
[1:14:01] rock look into a
[1:14:03] grave
[1:14:06] or a lovely little chunk of your own
[1:14:08] lovely loving heart has been
[1:14:13] buried the
[1:14:17] SE I am the resurrection of the
[1:14:21] life rest
[1:14:24] Assurance we speak of
[1:14:29] faith we talk of faith and I wonder
[1:14:33] sometimes if we know what we're talking
[1:14:36] about I wonder if it isn't hope instead
[1:14:38] of
[1:14:41] faith faith doesn't
[1:14:43] move no matter how contrary it
[1:14:47] looks our faith stays right
[1:14:50] there our faith stays right there
[1:14:53] and you know there everybody was
[1:14:56] silent they were going around the walls
[1:14:58] of
[1:14:59] Jericho you know and on the in the last
[1:15:02] at the at the the on the seventh
[1:15:05] one they went around seven
[1:15:08] times you know and when and when the
[1:15:11] leader gave the
[1:15:14] shout when he said you know do he speak
[1:15:16] or
[1:15:19] shout then and that's when the walls
[1:15:21] came down
[1:15:23] you see because God don't speak in
[1:15:26] vain Jesus doesn't speak in
[1:15:29] vain Jesus doesn't speak in
[1:15:32] vain you see when he went to the
[1:15:35] cross it was just something you know
[1:15:38] something beyond our
[1:15:41] comprehension you know until a prophet
[1:15:44] came you know and revealed to us oh you
[1:15:47] know the the mighty thing that silence
[1:15:49] can
[1:15:52] do amen amen amen oh because when he
[1:15:56] dies you see when you
[1:15:59] die because it's not just about him
[1:16:03] dying but that was just the beginning of
[1:16:05] something
[1:16:07] else because it wasn't just about him
[1:16:11] dying but you have to
[1:16:18] die when he was on the
[1:16:21] cross and he didn't say
[1:16:23] word oh he could have said a
[1:16:26] word but you know at that
[1:16:28] point you know if he would have called
[1:16:32] for the
[1:16:34] Angels they would have
[1:16:37] came but then he wouldn't have received
[1:16:39] the
[1:16:41] glory he would not have received the
[1:16:43] glory if the Angels had
[1:16:46] come he had to stay
[1:16:49] silent amen
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:52] amen
[1:16:55] but he gave up The
[1:17:01] Ghost and what we fail to realize many
[1:17:05] times is that when it's our turn to
[1:17:10] die when it's our time to let
[1:17:14] go of what we
[1:17:16] have of who we
[1:17:18] are we don't
[1:17:21] realize that it's an opport
[1:17:25] it's an
[1:17:26] opportunity that opens up so many more
[1:17:30] channels more channels for somebody
[1:17:34] else more channels to do things for
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:37] others it opens up so many
[1:17:40] things you see the conquer of
[1:17:44] Jero it was the tearing down of the
[1:17:48] walls and you know that's what we put up
[1:17:50] many
[1:17:52] times we put up
[1:17:54] walls maybe amongst the
[1:17:57] Brethren or maybe amongst amongst you
[1:18:00] know other
[1:18:01] churches but God came to tear those
[1:18:06] down because he wants to
[1:18:09] conquer and you know you put up walls
[1:18:11] against God many
[1:18:14] times but you know he wants to
[1:18:17] conquer he wants to conquer the
[1:18:20] hearts because that's what we've done
[1:18:24] done we put up these
[1:18:27] walls but at the hearing of the word one
[1:18:30] more time at the hearing of the
[1:18:31] word oh we know that God breaks down
[1:18:35] those
[1:18:36] walls you know with just his
[1:18:39] love to know how great of a love that he

[1:19:09] way if you ever want to get
[1:19:14] conquer you're going to have to allow
[1:19:16] God to
[1:19:20] work to find that place
[1:19:24] where you can just hear hear
[1:19:27] him where it's not it's nobody else
