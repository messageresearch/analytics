I give thanks to God for the prege to be here I give thanks to my pastor for the trust nothing in the ways of God and one can wait on God God works in his perfect how many believe that how many bring their Bible remember this is the sword to the church we should bring our Bible many people bring their iphon their phones many people bring a lot of stuff but they don't bring their Bible if you don't bring your Bible you came to the wrong place because we came here to the word of God and we're all here to learn how are we going to learn if we have the we can say many words here but you need to what is a word of God if you may please stand we'll go to the book of Acts my name is Oscar I am Mexican I'm not salad I'm Mexican book of Acts chapter two and verse one when you're ready you may say amen amen is the word of God is written in these pages p and when the when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place in that same book in chapter one verse four it says like this me and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he ye have heard of me let us pray Our Father who are in heaven I come before your presence tonight recognizing Lord that you are The Sovereign God and that in you there is there's no coincidences your word is infallible and your purposes must be done Lord I ask for my brothers tonight may you touch every heart may you an my lips May Oscar depart so that you can take this place and speak through my lips and may it be a blessing to your people because I ask this in your in the precious name of Lord our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may be seated Brothers one of the points that stand out to me reading this book was the key word was they said do not depart wait on the promise today's thought is on waiting wait to wait to wait we're living in some times where people don't know how to wait people outside and people in here as well we don't know how to wait you see the life of the human being the life of human being is running and running join fastly and if your secular or natural life is to run and to run and not to wait let me tell you you will fail you will fail because all Son of God the word says is Guided by the spirit of God and when you're Guided by the spirit of God you will know to wait on him God never fails or never makes a mistake God has made everything perfect at his time first he created man and then the heavens he did not create man and then Stars it was all an order because if he created man first where would he put him if he created man first where would that man from so we recognize God is a god of order in these times we are seeing there's a desperation in the humankind and that desperation has not been good to the humankind we have a pregnant woman and her nine months of pregnancy but when she has six seven months she wants to see that baby when the young man is 14 years old many of you when one is Young and has 14 years of age we wanted to be 20 already and when you got to 20 he wanted to be 30 because you saw everyone else how they how much Freedom they had to do what they wanted to and now that we have 40 or 50 we want to have we want to be 10 because we see our children and how much we say I want to you work you don't work and you're not worried about anything you have everything you have to eat and what he asked for it is given to him I want to tell you tonight youth that you're in the right time not not more or less the time of god is perfect there's a desperation place it in the hands of God God has the best for you I tell you this by experience because I was from a family that I was adopted I want to say this quickly because I believe it's going to be a help to you knowing that every single one of you has their testimony some got brought them out of alcoholism others out of drugs and others out of the worst but if God call us out of there it's for something these people went to go away for the Holy Spirit and when they received the Holy Spirit the Lord Jesus said you will be a witness today witness of what of his power of His glory because many were saved so every single one of us has a purpose I want to focus on youth because there's who next because those of us who have 40 50 60 years of age brother B would say this I have 45 years of age and I already feel old what how is it to those who are 50 or those 55 or 60 pastor at the park that there was a sadness in my heart because God called me since the age of eight and I always avoided God and he kept on calling me from 14 to 15 years and I avoided him and time passed on until he had to do something to call me out and when I recognized it was the calling of God I had to do what he was telling me to do when the re to my life and I knew it was God my life was filled of sadness why because now I want to do do the will of God many things but there's no more strengths the strength are waning out I can't see as well sad we have such a great God and full of love that he does not condemn you for that he's a god of opportunity and I believe every single one of us has an opport opportunity from God what will we do with that opportunity God took me to a family so they would raise me to to guard to protect me they instruct me in the ways of the Lord under the denomination M my mom was a Pres Arian my sisters were Baptists and had a Pentecostal brother it was a salad and it comes to a moment where you have to make the decision I was baptized in every single one of those churches I have like six or seven baptisms so if it's about baptism already there it's about the Revelation on the part of God when I was 40 years of age about that the Lord brought me to the message I'm I'm not for so long in the message but I believe it with all my heart that it's the truth of God and the Youth of this place should be thankful with God it's a supernatural way because they're in the right place they're with the right message look many people fail outside because they don't have any advice they need advice or counseling but the counseling depends on who is from amen but even then people outside fail because there's no counseling but the people of God when they have a good that's unexplainable that's unexplainable the people of God as they walk with him everything was good there were blessings no one would get sick everything was going well but when they deviated when they did not want to take the counseling of their Prophet when they no longer want to listen to the coun of their Pastor that's when it went wrong they paid the consequences of their decisions and brother Bram says this every person will pay their consequence of their decisions we have to learn to wait on God Patiently I Waited on the Lord said David patiently we are not patient every single one of us has a burden here have a struggle or a fight or a battle some may be financially others may be a sickness others are struggling because they want a boyfriend or girl others because they want a girlfriend but we're all struggling in this walk it's a struggle it's a battle and if you don't grab on to God and wait on God we're going to struggle even more I want to tell you this story for the Youth because the adults we're already we don't apply to this I knew an evangelist who ministered to some Youth and this that this camper campaign this was his theme ask do not choose or do not grab he preached this to the youth ask do not choose and he gave his testimony on how God gave him his wife I want to tell this to the youth because if you're praying a deep call it the deep and this young man started to pray for his partner and he asked God God is a specific God and whatever you ask him that's what he'll give you and this young man started to ask God God I want a young lady that is thin long hair clear or light light colored eyes but above all that loves you and that was his prayer until one occasion God talked to him through a vision and told him tomorrow at 9 in the morning you go to this certain place to this Supermarket the market there's a section where they sell food and he told me you go to the aisle four you go to the left and at the last Shelf at the right hand there will be a a cafe you'll go there and you ask for a coffee a young lady will attend to you when she gives you this coffee and you grab that coffee she will not let you pay for it that is her the brother said he woke up at 5 in the morning he took a shower and he dressed and he did his hair as best he could and at 7 in the morning he was at the supermarket to church he was late but he went to the supermarket early he said that when he walked on the aisle like God had told him he went he went to the right and he went to the cafe and there was this young lady and the young lady was worshiping God she had her praise and he greeted her and he said what she said what would you like and he told her I like a coffee with my my pleasure she served him the coffee they talked and when he finished that coffee he he told her how much will it be she said nothing he said how come it's nothing she said nothing because the Lord told me you would come here today how is was that I have been praying for my partner and the Lord told me he'd be here and he told me he'd ask Mee but not to charge him that is your partner now we believe if that's the word of God or not because brother BR St when he went to go for a brother and he was guided the Bible says we're all the children of God by the spirit of God I want to say you tonight keep on praying keep on waiting patiently wait God has something better for you than you canose you can make a mistake make a mistake but God could never God bless it was a [Applause] pleasure bless you man I'm going to go ahead and uh read that verse once again Acts chapter 2 verse one says like this says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place amen may God have the blessing to the reading of his word amen Pentecost P I think Pentecost is a process hard one amen um when they told us we were going to preach on Pentecost I didn't know really know what to say I've got a little taste of Pentecost um so I I didn't know what I could share you know that's why I stayed on verse one and didn't go past that amen but I just kind of started thinking if you allow me to dramatize a little bit how this group of people um they're all gathered together in one place I mean you can probably imagine they're pretty Maybe dirty beaten left everything they don't have nothing to turn back to now their leader is gone maybe they turned to one another and they're like hey hey and he's like you think it's worth it you got any regrets and maybe that guy or that sister whoever it might have been they started going back to all the adventures they might have had with Jesus all the things that they went through with him then he gives them the answer says no no amen amen that's kind of how I feel you sit here and you try to live a Christian Life trying to push and get to your experience amen that turning point in your life and you start thinking about quitting you start thinking it's too much amen because I think that we as Christian we struggle more than the people in the world we have our everyday problems along with the ones that the spiritual amen and I think that that's just a part of life you know life has Seasons amen our life is constantly changing we're put in different conditions all the time man I think there's one thing that we can count on though and that's that God doesn't change amen amen the sun always comes out and I was kind of thinking about that today was we had a rainy day a couple days ago but the sun still came out a lot of times we don't I don't personally realize the sun's out it's just out there amen but I kind of started thinking about it and I realized that in order to reap those benefits that the son gives us we have to be out in the sun there's got to be contact with the sun amen amen if we want our Pentecostal [Music] experience it's not going to cut it just to come to church amen we have to have a relationship with God if we want God to come to us I don't know how many times I can count where I Crow to God and I want God to come on the scene but there's no relationship amen amen I don't know if we realize church but God when his holy spirit comes down he is impregnating us amen his spirit is living us inside of us amen and in order for that to happen there has to be a relationship amen just like the world revolves around the Sun our our world has to revolve around the son the Lord Jesus amen amen praise be to God amen I don't even know where to begin just a lot going on right now with me you talk about conditions and conditions change for me every day seems like there's so much stress all the time right in the morning you can ask I couldn't even hold something yesterday I was dropping it you know but in I think in those moments I think I personally I tend to hide myself you know um and that's opposite of what you should do you know I think that relationship that relationship with God is is that's when it should really come out you know is when you don't feel it amen a lot of times I tend to hide myself you know we hide ourselves in the shade you know and God only knows what we go through right um sorry yeah God only knows what we go through it's it's a personal battle for sure amen but you know the light the light it exposes amen and a lot of times that's what scares us when you get closer to God is everything else comes with it amen all of our sins all of our secrets they all come with it amen it brings them out but that's the only way that we can really truly know our condition and get better is if we come out into the light and man I think a lot of times for us we're just afraid of what people are going to think maybe or maybe we're ashamed you know and I get it you know our conditions are pretty bad sometimes but they don't get any better by us hiding amen I just ask that God you know God stand still long enough you know for me to get rid of this condition you know you sit here in the you read that story in the Bible where God stopped the Sun and uh he stopped the Sun for the children of Israel and Joshua said to him you know God he said God let the sun stand still long enough for me to avenge myself of my enemies and I liked that I was like you know what God give me the same Lord God stand still long enough for me to get rid of this stress stand so long enough for me to get rid of this anxiety stand still long enough for me to get rid of this depression this bad attitude these sins me being judgmental to my brother and you know and that's another thing too imagine if the children of Israel were fighting in darkness I can't be in one Accord with him or any of you for that matter if I'm in sin if I'm in darkness if I can't see my condition we're going to be fighting each other and God can't come down God needs one Accord God needs for us to be together amen amen I'll be closing with this quote from the message the resurrection of Lazarus it's paragraph 24 says this it says notice that the angel of God will perform his word he'll bring his word to pass regardless when the season comes Harvesters arrive God is going to send his word and perform his things amen so this just tells us the prophet right there just told us that regardless of our season God's still going to come and and perform his word amen we just have to trust in that a lot of times I I don't have anything else to trust you know and I think that's the best way to be is when you don't have anything else to fall back on it's all God it's all up to God Amen and that's what brings you to Pentecost is you're not rolling the dice it's not a gamble but it's an assurance it's an assurance that there's light at the end of the tunnel if you notice all these people in the upper room they were all worshiping they were getting ready and God up in heaven above that began to pull him down amen amen our conditions regardless of what they are if we bring them to him he's going to come down regardless Brothers amen that's all I have God bless you [Applause] amen God bless you I believe God is already here tonight I believe he's already here working I hope that's not by feeling though but by faith knowing that God is working knowing that God is faithful when everything else seems contrary right away if you could please stand for the reading of the word Acts 2 verse 1- 4 says like this and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them UT may God add blessings to his word you may take your seats I'm just going to start off with the simple question how many are ready for a Pentecost tell yourselves right now how many want a new Pentecost do we want a new Pentecost Church how many want it tonight how many truly want a new Pentecost tonight how many want a new experience tonight how many want the Holy Spirit know the title in which I which we and my brother Diego have chosen was another Pentecost and if there's one thing certain if there's something that I truly believe is that we as one church we as one bride we we need another Pentecost see see brother brandham says it himself a real of Pentecost gathered as one heart one soul and one mind that is how God wants the church you see when the Bible talks to us about the Pentecost you know we must understand brothers that you see it's what we must understand is uh one thing to know about the story of Pentecost you know what does Pentecost mean what's the meaning behind Pentecost you know the Greek word for Pentecost signifies 50 days why 50 days you see the Pentecost it wasn't just one day the Pentecost wasn't just an event of one day you see the Bible shows us that it took many days it didn't take one day but many days it would took many days many days had to pass in order to fulfill the days of Pentecost you see but the day of Pentecost it didn't fulfill it didn't fulfill till Jesus resurrected from the grave you see there was 50 days in which it had to happen in order for the Pentecost to fully come before the 50 days we know that Jesus had to go through the crucifixion that came the resurrection but something else came after the resurrection and that's something that we must understand the Bible shows us that on the third day when Jesus resurrected from the [Applause] grave appeared unto his disciples and he walked with them for 40 days God resurrected on the third day and walked with the disciples for 40 days acts 1:3 to whom also he shot himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs being SE of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God so we see that after the crucifixion his flesh died but his Spirit ra but his Spirit raised from the dead and brother Bram says that he was 40 days on Earth with men what happened after those 40 days the the Ascension he was lifted up and raptured but before he was raptured or ascended he tells his disciples to go and wait wait for what what did they have to wait for you see the disciples they needed to wait so they seen the kingdom of God upon them you see they needed to wait till they were endured with the power from on high you see but what else did they have to wait for the promise in which Jesus gave them and church what was that promise what was the promise that he gave them brother says in which God said that he will come again and dwell among his people by the not by flesh not by flesh but by spiritual Revelation and let me tell you tonight Brothers let me tell you tonight that fulfilled promise brother brandom says that that fulfilled promise was John 1420 and what's that promise but at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye in me and I in you that was the promise right there church you see in Acts chapter 2 in the inauguration of Pentecost we see the Apostle Paul here gathered with the other disciples and they are gathered in one Accord there are there are many there were many but they were in one Accord in in the upper room see brother Bram says that on that day about 120 people men and women were in one Upper Room praying together you see and here we see them praying for 10 days 10 days and 10 nights brother Bren 10 days and nights they had to wait they had to wait for Jesus so that he could pour himself onto them and something thing that we must understand is that they weren't going to receive that power from on high quickly they wer going to receive it right away see they had to prepare themselves spiritually they couldn't receive the spirit of Christ the way they were no brothers let me tell you something they had to correct themselves spiritually and they had to correct their [Applause] atmosphere in order for God you will be able to manifest in them you see they had to prepare themselves as one and in one Accord and that's the problem that we as a church have that's the problem that I have you see Brothers I include myself in this problem we we have become blind to the promise that God gave us God wants to abide in the church God wants to dwell in the church God wants to pour himself on the church you see but the problem is you see the problem is that there is no unity in the church there is no unity in the congregation we see Brothers gossiping we see brothers fighting we see Brothers talking behind their backs we see all this fighting but there's no unity and God can't work in un when there is no Unity you see there was a purpose for Why God sent the Holy Spirit it was so that he [Applause] himself the that same Pillar of Fire that was with the Israelites that same holy spirit that fell on Pentecost might dwell in this church too but what happened we have become too coldhearted our hearts are too [Applause] hardened we have become so cold brother too cold to the Holy Spirit brother Bram says we become so coldhearted to the point where we can't even shed one tear it's sad it's sad Brothers we can't even shed one tear [Music] anymore because we are so spiritually dead spiritually cold you see brother the love of God seems to be pulling away we don't have the hunger for Christ anymore we don't have the thirst for Christ anymore we don't have the thirst or hunger for this message and this message this message it's a privilege it's a privilege because this is not for anybody this message is not for anybody message is for the bride but yet we don't have the hunger for it we don't have the thirst for it and I speak for myself because I I don't take that time to really dig myself in the message brother the fire the fire is gone brothers that fire that fire is no longer there in the church we as a church have taken a pattern a pattern that is not of the Bible that is not of the message you see youth we have confirmed ourselves to thinking that by going to church that is going to save us that by going to a congregation three times a week that's going to save us we have conf confirmed ourselves with thinking that by saying that we are Christians by saying that we know this message we're all good we don't have to do anything else let's just relax you see brother brandom says no wonder no wonder the church has gone to Sentimental feelings and emotions we have confirmed ourselves with emotions and feelings if the service isn't good if the preaching isn't good if the if if the whole service isn't good I'm going home man this isn't even worth it God's not even working it feels like God's God's God's away from us let me tell you something God isn't the one who moved God isn't the one who moved the one who Moved is us because we are so blind we are so blind you see to the point where we have gone to the old ways of this world and the truth of it is brothers and I say this for myself because I I don't stand behind this Pulpit as this holy person I'm a sinner I think I'm the worst sinner in this room that's how I think of myself and I want to tell you all tonight youth it's sad we try to live in sin and possess the holy ghost at the same time oh how we need a holy ghost Revival to clean up this Church something that I like that one that brother ber once said is that we as human beings we have serpents inside of us serpent is inside of us it doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter if you're a preacher doesn't matter if you're a musician doesn't matter if you work in the audio room it does not matter you have that serpent inside of you and that serpent will try its best to separate you from God little by little you see Brothers it's part of our nature it's part of our human nature our flesh doesn't want to have Fellowship our flesh doesn't want to go to church our flesh wants to stay at home flesh wants to go on the couch and watch Netflix our flesh just wants to relax our our flesh doesn't want want time to spend with God doesn't want fellowship with God you see this flesh prefers to be out there in the world and the truth of it is there is no desperation in us to receive more of God there is no desperation in us to go to church to get closer to God to grow more spiritually that desperation has G you it is gone you see I get desperate when my football team is playing I got to know if they're winning or losing I got to know if they're winning or losing otherwise I'm going go crazy you see sometimes we youth we are desperate to see when the service will end we are so desperate to see when church is going to be done so that we can go back home and go back to our routine so we can do what our flesh loves if the musicians may pass you see this flesh prefers to be out there in the world but where's the desperation of Christ where's the desperation of Christ I don't have the desperation Brothers I I'm not going to I'm not going to be behind this pulpit and act like a holy person I'm a sinner and I know that I don't have that desperation in me I haven't given it all for Christ we haven't given it all for Christ we haven't given it 100% why there's no unity in the church there's no unity in the congregation you see on that day of Pentecost when the pillar of fire when the Holy Spirit separated itself and settled itself onto the church it brought back the unified Body of Christ look at the church now look at the church now living in times of Separation you see not from the world but from the spirit of God but from the word of God see Brothers we live in times of denominational differences and those make me feel good doctrines you see the reason why the so many churches are losing their power why they're losing so much many power and losing their position in the body of Christ is because the church is not United the church is not in [Music] unity the family is not strong as one see God cannot manifest himself and reveal himself if the church is not spiritually United you see there is revelation in the the word when there is spiritual [Music] Unity stand you know we have the incorrect nature in US Brothers have the incorrect atmosphere and it's difficult for us to enter into the right [Music] atmosphere you know it's difficult for us to give up [Music] it's difficult for us to give up what our flesh [Music] desires our flesh wants to stay at [Music] home let's be honest our flesh doesn't want this don't try to act holy [Music] tonight don't be holy tonight brothers and sisters our flesh doesn't want to be here we don't want to sacrifice enough to the Lord and I know you it's difficult to [Music] change I know it's difficult to change but I tell you tonight out there we won we won't find [Music] anything it's a shame it's a shame that I call myself a Christian I call myself a Christian Christian and yet I go back to the things that I told God to bring me out [Music] of why do we resist the Holy Spirit Brothers why do we resist [Music] it God wants to dwell inside of us but we just pull back we're too cold hard [Music] but Brothers God has everything that we need I could only say so much behind this pulit you can you have to make the decision tonight do we want to give everything for Christ it takes a sacrifice it takes a sacrifice to have the Holy Spirit you see but it's worth it you see because in the Holy Spirit there is fire and that fire when that fire comes down it burns out it burns it burns what what is impure inside of us and tonight church we burn we need to burn we need that fire set us so that we we may like God so that he could dwell in us remember youth God loves each and every one of us he just wants to dwell inside of us just open your hearts it doesn't take much it doesn't take much all it takes is a sincere Hearts just open up tonight you'll see what God will do with you tonight God bless [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
