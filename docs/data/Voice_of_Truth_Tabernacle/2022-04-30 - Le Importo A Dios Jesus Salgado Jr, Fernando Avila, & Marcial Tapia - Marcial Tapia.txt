other different places but god chose you to be here because we know that god has something for us tonight god's blessings amen if you can open your bibles to genesis chapter 37 [Music] verse 3 when you have you may say amen now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a court of many colors and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him i want to thank god for allowing me to be here tonight and also my pastor for giving me the opportunity to be behind us now we are continuing the topic of joseph jose and through these friday services that have been coming up i believe we all have a good understanding of joseph's life and something that joseph's life that he has taught me joseph's story has shown me that god was always with joseph jose that god was with joseph from where his brother betrayed him from where his brother sold him and god the same way is still with us god has always been with us he's not only with us today he's always with us brothers we see our past life and we see what we are now [Music] and we can see through through the through the years that god has really changed us amen the the the subject of tonight is i matter to god he would leave he still wants us to go to his path now we see that that joseph was the favorite the favorite son joseph was loved more more than all his brothers and his brothers hated him because of that he was the youngest amongst the 12 brothers saying how is my father gonna love him more than me how is he gonna love him more than more than me i am the oldest brother they hated joseph so much to the point where they wanted to get rid of him to the point where they wanted they didn't want to see him no more we have to understand the the the much anger they had the and there's a love that makes me love my brother that is what makes me love my brother that is what makes me appreciate my brothers in the the location in joseph's brothers because they might have seen the blessing that jose that god gave to joseph but they didn't see the blessings that they had they [Music] i believe that it is a blessing that we woke up today we don't know how many more services we have amen and god has grace towards us amen in the in the message talk on the word preached in the in the year 53. it says how how joseph perfect type of christ how he was born and admits his brothers hated of his brothers loved of his father court of many because he could see with spiritual eyes he really felt bad when he was sold by his brothers from the beginning to the end god had control over joseph over joseph's life he kept saying he could interpret dreams and see visions and they hated him they hated him for a just cause he seems in causa so they so did they hate jesus because he was a spirit because he was spiritual his brothers just had envy towards joseph because what god because the blessing that god that god gave to joseph but i believe that we need to take a look at our blessings because a lot want joseph to do better than them they they weren't okay with joseph being loved more okay they call them beltabus they they hate his church today those have brothers and sisters because because of the spiritual spirit of god that moves in the in the in the in the born-again believers brothers is because that is what god came to us we just have to let him take control of our life we have to allow him to to move inside of us even though joseph was served by by his brothers even though joseph felt bad because of his what his brothers did i believe that he always knew that there was something more for him joseph's life might have been falling apart even when it may seem like god is nowhere to be found he is always with us he always has an eye over us he's always taking care of us at all times brothers uh when things might have been falling apart that is what god is doing tonight at the end i i'll go i'll go when was that joseph and they ended up providing for his brothers not just providing for them for providing for the people but there is still someone that you can trust yeah you know i ask myself a lot of the time why is it so hard to believe why is it so hard to receive of god and it is because we make it hard because [Music] because even a lot of the time we can give sometimes our time to god we can give god his worship but we want to receive of god that is why we name that god is always with us that we matter to god if we matter to god you say you will always take care of us he's always been taken care of may god bless you [Applause] amen god bless you can you guys hear me thank you uh brother jesus for the word tonight amen the story of joseph teaches us a lot like he says about envy amen let's be meek and humble amen because that's a godly character that's how jesus walked on this earth and that's how brother branham walked on this earth because everything he did he pointed towards god and not himself you know thus says the lord how long will it be until you humble yourself and us says the lord in this you will know that i am the lord yes that i am your lord amen um there was a there's a story that i was i was i was recalling when when he was uh talking about the brothers you know it would be nice if you if you kill that ego flying up there orlando and the the hunter tells the ego i need feathers to reach that that that uh that um the highness that high yeah he shoots tira he misses ifaya and it contains you the ego getting more more feathers he aims and he misses ifaya and then another feather then another he no longer could fly because he had he was left with no with no feathers is that if you are envy if you have envy towards your brother if you have jealousy for someone else the only person you are hurting amen let's go ahead and open our bibles to uh the book of um the book of genesis genesis book of genesis 37 capital and then from there i'm going to go to verse 19 and 20. so it says like this verse 5. now joseph had a dream and he told it to his brothers and they hated him even more verse 19 and 20. then they said to one another look this streamer is coming tony come therefore let us now kill him and cast him in into some pit and we shall say some wild beasts has has devoured him we we shall see what will become of his dreams is so we have joseph here and just the background i'm sure we all know the story of joseph jose the second youngest of the brothers and our brothers preached about that though two fridays ago about the coke so god god god spoke to joseph through dreams amen yes amen uh how many dreams how many dreamers do we have do we have any just a few of us the rest i'm guessing nightmares you know i had a dream once and this was before i moved to colorado colorado and i i've only shared with my family back in cali solomon family in california and god is my witness because i believe god gave me that dream the second one the segundo it was i was gonna own a house and then the third one it was i was gonna have a family okay all before the age of 30. probably one of the best dreams i've ever had and i'm claiming it in the name of jesus and i tell god nowadays if you want to fulfill that dream by next year is the harder it gets your life gets tougher in order for your dream to come true you must go through nightmares is to discourage you from fulfilling fulfilling your dreams amen amen so in order to fulfill your dreams you have to have the holy spirit you can't do it alone do you only walk with him on fridays and sundays domingos you know you're gonna have to struggle before you receive the blessings it was joseph's dream of jose i got him into the pit because after joseph told his brothers it says in genesis 37 24. and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it agua that joseph was the perfect type of jesus christ not just perfect but he also says a beautiful type of better sounds i was with joseph when he was rejected of his brothers because he was spiritual and the rest of them were carnal spiritually i was with him when all the reproach he had to stand by his own brothers he was for we are all one in jesus christ i was with joseph in his cave i was with him when he went to the right hand of pharaoh how would you ever know that i was going to come to your rescue yo you know joseph kept the faith [Music] a good fight finished and kept the face the story of olympic runner olimpico [Music] he was telling the story that he got an injury and he said uh that his father his number one fan was watching and that he notices that his dad was watching him on the sideline and he told he told his medical teams like leave me alone but they wouldn't leave him alone so he started hopping he started continuing and then his dad stepped in and the dad was telling the medical team he's like leave him alone they can leave him alone it's not about winning this race is not about winning this race is about finishing strong my son strong and i'm telling you tonight don't quit the race amen latoya if you don't have the friends necessary if [Music] because you matter to god you may go ahead and stand up and with this i'm going to leave the place to our brother marshall god rest you joseph hussain in order if we continue reading the story of joseph god rescue joseph in order to rescue judah in order and then from rescuing judah yes there is but don't worry because we have god on our side is possible with him [Applause] very nice today for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the
