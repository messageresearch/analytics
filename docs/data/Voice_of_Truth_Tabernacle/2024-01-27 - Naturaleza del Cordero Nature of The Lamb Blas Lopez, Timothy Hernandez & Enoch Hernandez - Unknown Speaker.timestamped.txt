[28:13] scripture we continue to speak on our
[28:15] Lord Jesus
[28:16] Christ how many like the
[28:19] word how many like the word
[28:23] Brothers the word of God Brothers it's
[28:27] life
[28:29] it's truly the word of God
[28:34] Brothers it brings us closer to
[28:39] God let's read 1 Corinthians
[28:44] 13:11 the word of the Lord says like
[28:56] this
[29:02] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[29:05] understood as a child I thought as a
[29:07] child but when I became a man I put away
[29:10] childish
[29:13] things we're reading this biblical
[29:18] passage and last week my
[29:22] brothers Isaac and brother
[29:26] Marshall they spoken of this same
[29:29] verse because we're understanding
[29:32] brother have you thought have you put
[29:37] yourself what was the Lord Jesus
[29:41] doing what did he want to do he was a
[29:47] youth he was a youth he the word says He
[29:50] was around 12 years
[29:53] old and we know through the
[29:56] prophet that between 12 and 13 years
[30:00] old a youth
[30:02] Brothers they go into their youth or
[30:05] they go into a young
[30:08] adulthood they go past the age of
[30:12] accountability he's no longer going to
[30:13] have excuses you're no longer going to
[30:16] have excuses if you're 12 or 13 years
[30:18] old you're not going to be able to say
[30:20] over
[30:21] there I didn't hear speak the Lord or
[30:24] they didn't tell me anything Brothers
[30:31] at that age you're responsible for your
[30:34] actions you
[30:36] brothers and
[30:39] I we're in the same boat this evening
[30:45] Brothers we have the prophetic
[30:48] word the most certain
[30:50] word is this
[30:54] word outside of this brother there's
[30:58] nothing we have the message of the hour
[31:01] Brothers we know
[31:03] Brothers Through The
[31:07] Prophet that
[31:10] he he came to fulfill the word of the
[31:13] Lord he didn't to lose time or just
[31:16] waste time he came
[31:19] humble showing the
[31:21] world in the Old
[31:24] Testament that is they spoke of a lamb
[31:28] was going to be
[31:30] slain where did they find
[31:34] him found sitting in the
[31:36] temple on
[31:39] Easter what was celebrated on Easter
[31:42] Brothers every man
[31:46] Brothers had to take a
[31:48] dove for the
[31:51] sacrifice but the sacrifice was there
[31:55] seated there was a sacrifice
[31:57] Brothers
[31:59] Brothers in this
[32:01] evening the Lord is
[32:04] here the Lord is here in the same
[32:08] way waiting to hear from
[32:11] you you have questions deceive me here's
[32:15] the Lord
[32:16] Brothers he can answer
[32:18] them the word of the Lord
[32:21] says that he was seated sitting
[32:24] down those doctors of the law
[32:28] right
[32:30] brothers and he would
[32:32] answer he didn't keep silent he he
[32:35] answered
[32:37] them what does a youth do today of 13
[32:40] years of
[32:42] age I was hearing our
[32:44] brother because I hear every I don't
[32:47] have I don't
[32:49] have I don't have any
[32:52] favor the word of the
[32:55] lord it's life brother
[32:58] I hear
[33:00] everyone my
[33:02] brother and my brother
[33:05] Marsh last
[33:09] Friday and I was hearing brother Alden
[33:11] as
[33:12] well those that preach
[33:15] Brothers it's all a
[33:17] blessing it's all a
[33:19] blessing the prophet shows us that if
[33:23] you or
[33:25] someone if you don't like
[33:29] something puts it like a cherry
[33:32] pie you're eating a cherry pie
[33:35] right and sometimes that that pie has
[33:38] the pit in
[33:42] [Music]
[33:44] it he says that he takes that which is
[33:46] good and throws out that and that's the
[33:49] way I believe with all of my heart that
[33:53] this message and in this
[33:55] word
[33:57] everything is edible nothing is thrown
[34:00] out and I tell you
[34:06] that I want to read a little bit because
[34:07] I believe in my
[34:09] heart Brothers of 13 years of
[34:12] age he shouldn't be
[34:15] relaxed sometimes the youth don't want
[34:17] to come to
[34:20] church I was also a youth at one point
[34:23] don't think
[34:25] that but at one point I was young
[34:28] I went through that
[34:30] Brothers a youth can have a lot of
[34:33] excus to not come to
[34:36] church he can say well I have a lot of
[34:40] homework I'm not gonna
[34:43] go because I feel a little
[34:48] sick I was feeling sick
[34:51] today I couldn't even
[34:53] speak but
[34:55] Brothers Brothers I believe in the
[34:58] Lord and I believe in Divine Healing as
[35:02] well the prophet
[35:05] says the doctors give you medicine and
[35:08] you take it
[35:10] right but the Lord is the one who gives
[35:12] a
[35:13] healing well if you believe it if you
[35:16] believe
[35:17] it forgive
[35:19] me are you happy
[35:25] Brothers how many can say glory to God
[35:29] Brothers how many can say I believe God
[35:33] Amen brother I also believe
[35:36] him the word
[35:44] says I like this because the prophet
[35:46] said lean not unto your own
[35:48] understand many people go off based off
[35:51] of their own understanding they
[35:54] say they can say I think this
[35:57] I think
[36:01] that that is leaning on our own
[36:05] understanding we have the word of the
[36:09] Lord and this is
[36:12] our it's not in the
[36:14] word then do away
[36:17] with ask God Be
[36:20] Still as Mary
[36:23] brothers look at what she's saying here
[36:29] but they did not understand the words
[36:30] she
[36:38] spoke but she kept all these things in
[36:40] her
[36:43] heart and she didn't understand
[36:45] everything she didn't understand
[36:48] everything I don't understand everything
[36:50] either but I believe
[36:52] it I keep it in my heart
[36:55] Brothers oh this isn't that
[36:58] way because I haven't heard it but I
[37:01] believe it
[37:02] right later on Brothers in our
[37:06] walk God is going to give us
[37:09] understanding of what that meant to
[37:13] say lead not unto your own
[37:16] understanding
[37:18] education it it it'll
[37:22] last and it will give you a good
[37:25] job
[37:27] look as the prophet
[37:31] said I'm not telling the youth not to go
[37:33] and get an
[37:35] education or for them to be
[37:38] illiterate you have to continue
[37:41] on you have to put God
[37:45] first it's
[37:48] God at 13 years
[37:52] old he might have wanted to be
[37:55] with May playing PlayStation
[38:00] online oh Brothers I see how
[38:02] much because I have
[38:06] youth pray day after
[38:09] day the example
[38:12] Brothers set them the
[38:14] example because that's what the Lord is
[38:16] telling
[38:17] you I don't tell you anything
[38:21] truly pray for every one of
[38:25] them also going to
[38:28] share
[38:31] um oh I'm adding a little bit to my
[38:36] trailer and I I scolded my son
[38:38] Christopher very and I felt so bad
[38:41] brothers I asked him for forgiveness
[38:46] Brothers it's because you have to be
[38:49] humble and also respect what they
[38:52] do many times
[38:55] Brothers you have have to live the word
[38:58] for
[38:59] them you have to live the
[39:02] word so that they can believe
[39:07] it how are you going to want them to
[39:09] come to
[39:10] church if the dad if the head of the
[39:13] family the dad doesn't want to
[39:15] go how can you set an example to your
[39:19] children thankful with the
[39:22] Lord truly right
[39:24] brothers and at the same time brother I
[39:26] want to I want
[39:29] to I have two minutes my time almost
[39:34] up but I also want to send my
[39:37] condolences to our sister y's
[39:40] family of our sister
[39:43] FL Brothers I know what it feels
[39:46] like to lose a
[39:49] nephew truly something
[39:51] painful because we know
[39:55] brother that when a member of the body
[39:58] of the Lord Jes
[40:01] hurts rest also joined with
[40:06] them and I send my
[40:09] condolences blessed be the
[40:14] Lord God sometimes lets us go through
[40:17] trial so that we can see
[40:20] brother he hasn't left
[40:22] us he with us Brothers he is there
[40:28] Al we might not
[40:29] see he's there with
[40:33] us I'm going to read a
[40:36] little I know that time
[40:41] flies that we're here in eternity when
[40:43] we're here Brothers the word
[40:47] Brothers I believe with all of my
[40:51] heart the Eternal Word of
[40:54] God it says
[40:59] education will bring you a good
[41:04] job possibly a position
[41:07] among and that's
[41:12] fine which will probably be a great help
[41:14] to
[41:16] you it will help you
[41:19] economic helping to sustain
[41:22] yourself perhaps it make a little bit
[41:24] better for you the prophet it
[41:27] says but remember
[41:29] child remember my son he says one day
[41:33] you're going to die oh
[41:36] Brothers you're not going to want to die
[41:38] without God one day you're GNA die he
[41:42] says after
[41:44] that listen young man young
[41:48] lady education is
[41:50] good put God first
[41:53] Brothers
[41:55] God
[41:57] God is the beginning of all
[41:59] wisdom if you want
[42:01] wisdom understand then ask God and God
[42:05] will give it to
[42:07] you godess I don't want to go over my
[42:11] may God bless
[42:17] you time
[42:21] flies amen the nature of the Lamb
[42:28] and now I want you to really think on
[42:29] that for a
[42:31] moment you know because the nature of a
[42:34] lamb you know the nature of a lamb is
[42:36] something that is subtle it's it's
[42:40] sweet you know when
[42:44] God you know God humbled himself so
[42:50] much that
[42:53] Jesus submitted himself says
[42:58] own
[43:00] parents now I don't think I don't think
[43:02] you guys are understanding
[43:04] this for me exploited my
[43:08] mind for for because of a because of
[43:12] God yeah how can
[43:15] God this almighty
[43:20] God come down to
[43:23] earth and be submitted
[43:27] to his own
[43:30] creation Now I think that should be
[43:32] enough for
[43:34] us that's enough for
[43:38] me how God can humble himself so
[43:43] much now we already read in Luke 2 verse
[43:46] 51 you don't have to turn your
[43:50] pages it says and he went down with them
[43:52] and came to
[43:55] Nazareth
[43:57] now this is the word that really
[43:59] intrigues me a
[44:02] lot it says and was
[44:06] subject unto them how many of us are
[44:10] subject to our
[44:14] pastor youth brother young man young
[44:17] lady how many of you are subject to your
[44:19] own
[44:22] parents how many of you obey your own
[44:25] parents
[44:29] I guess there's none
[44:31] here you know but you know in order for
[44:34] you to be
[44:37] obedient you have to be
[44:42] humble and that's what Jesus
[44:46] was Jesus was
[44:52] humble that's enough for me brothers and
[44:54] sisters
[44:56] if you can take something
[44:59] tonight brother
[45:05] sister you know among all the Miracles
[45:07] and surprises that you know surrounding
[45:10] God
[45:13] himself you know you know Luke 2 verse
[45:19] 51 you know it may sound like the most
[45:21] unexpected
[45:24] thing
[45:28] like the most
[45:31] unexpected
[45:35] amen and when I think of
[45:38] Jesus in this young
[45:41] man you know at the age of 12 as the
[45:45] Bible
[45:47] mentions you know
[45:49] when Jesus was over there doing the
[45:51] works of
[45:54] God you know when I think of
[45:58] that you know it makes
[46:01] me want
[46:04] to to a certain point want to feel like
[46:08] I'm not
[46:13] enough you know because at the age of 12
[46:16] I don't know what I was
[46:21] doing James 4:10
[46:24] says says humble yourselves in the sight
[46:27] of the
[46:31] Lord and He Shall lift you
[46:36] up and he shall lift you
[46:42] up you know what does the word humble
[46:45] mean to
[46:48] us what does the word humble mean to us
[46:53] youth what does it mean to you
[46:59] and the message the worst sinner in the
[47:06] city it says like this and when we think
[47:08] we're somebody's because we wear good
[47:14] clothing and ride a nice
[47:18] car shame on
[47:21] you it's a Pity that we got so far away
[47:24] from God
[47:29] I I can say that for
[47:31] myself there's many times in my
[47:34] life you know where I've gone so far
[47:36] away from
[47:37] God you know but there's something about
[47:40] Jesus you know that draws me that
[47:43] doesn't let me
[47:44] leave and I believe many of us can say
[47:47] the same
[47:48] thing something about
[47:53] that so few
[47:56] brother says I hate to say this but so
[47:58] few profess Christians today in our
[48:02] land profess today in our land know so
[48:05] little about
[48:10] God they know so little about
[48:19] God but to know
[48:22] God humbled himself
[48:26] that's what makes him great to
[48:29] me that's what makes him real to
[48:32] me think that he was willing to come
[48:37] down here and not be some great
[48:42] somebody take some great
[48:45] name or something like that he made
[48:48] himself
[48:49] humble and became a
[48:52] servant to all of them
[48:56] that's my Lord
[48:58] Jesus that's the one I love you love him
[49:05] tonight I want to give my life entirely
[49:08] to serve
[49:11] him how many can say the same thing
[49:15] tonight you know don't get me
[49:18] wrong you know us as Youth and I believe
[49:22] all of us youth can
[49:24] relate
[49:26] Ro can get a little bit
[49:31] bumpy am I
[49:42] right in the message humble
[49:47] thyself he says brother says the Way
[49:52] Up Is
[49:54] Down
[49:56] always he goes on saying if you want
[50:01] Power see how humble you can
[50:09] get my that's that's that's something
[50:12] for me that's personally for myself it's
[50:13] something that just explodes my
[50:20] mind just get away from all your your
[50:23] worldly
[50:24] thinking
[50:27] yourself before
[50:30] God and then you've got more power than
[50:33] the man that runs all over the buildings
[50:35] that makes a big lot of
[50:41] noise see because you have been able to
[50:43] conquer
[50:46] yourself and commit
[50:49] yourself to
[50:51] Christ you see to humble yourself before
[50:55] him
[50:58] that's really
[51:04] power how many of us are
[51:09] obedient I'm not saying you
[51:13] aren't but how many are obedient
[51:16] to what God tells you to
[51:24] do
[51:28] and and it takes it takes to be
[51:33] submissive I was talking to my dad
[51:38] earlier and and I he told me you know
[51:43] what is it to really be
[51:46] submissive you know because when
[51:49] somebody gets
[51:51] married you know of course the wife is
[51:54] sub submitt it to the
[52:00] husband but do they just do it does she
[52:03] just do it because she wants
[52:08] to or is it because out of
[52:12] love and I I I do believe that it takes
[52:19] love the the God's
[52:22] word no to God's word takes love for
[52:25] God's
[52:29] word am I
[52:31] right you do need
[52:44] love I want to read this me message
[52:50] too the message faith is our
[52:54] victory
[52:58] and that's the way it is with human
[53:01] life you can't play the rules of the
[53:03] game of Life wrong and expect you expect
[53:05] to
[53:10] win you've got to play it according to
[53:13] God's
[53:16] word and the purpose that you were
[53:18] brought here
[53:22] for now I I want us I want to get to a
[53:24] certain
[53:26] point you know
[53:28] and when you humble
[53:31] yourself and you're
[53:33] obedient to your parents to your
[53:37] pastor to
[53:39] God to God I believe that we can find
[53:43] our
[53:48] purpose continues on saying now there's
[53:50] so many people that doesn't seem to have
[53:52] any kind of purpose in life
[53:59] especially in this day that we live
[54:04] now people just seem to think that they
[54:06] have they have to do is keep up with
[54:08] somebody
[54:13] else with the Fashions of this world and
[54:16] with the enticement that the world has
[54:17] given to
[54:21] them just like this if you go to school
[54:24] and some of the little girls wear a
[54:25] certain little
[54:27] frock or
[54:34] dress or whatever you would call it and
[54:36] the ambition and the ambition the rest
[54:38] of the school has is to pattern after
[54:41] that
[54:46] girl now I want you to keep up with
[54:49] me some of the women see see on the
[54:52] television some certain lady come
[54:54] out
[54:57] andess and dress in a certain
[55:00] fashion well that's your ambition is to
[55:02] dress and act like
[55:06] that and that seems to just be about the
[55:08] limit of the American
[55:15] ambition to get a new job or to get a
[55:18] raise in your salary and to get a
[55:19] television or a new
[55:24] car
[55:27] let me say this those things may be all
[55:31] right but there's higher
[55:35] Ambitions in the human
[55:37] life than those
[55:40] things and Christians to set their
[55:45] affection on higher
[55:50] Ambitions that's what Jesus
[55:52] did Jesus Jesus wasn't here to please
[55:57] man here to please his father that was
[56:00] in
[56:01] heaven and why is it so hard for
[56:05] us that's the question that I've
[56:09] meditated is it so hard for
[56:14] me why is it so hard for
[56:18] me
[56:21] me to
[56:22] [Music]
[56:23] be to let myself be controlled in other
[56:29] words be guided by
[56:33] God continues on saying and I think it
[56:36] would pay us all to sit down and wonder
[56:38] why we are
[56:45] here and and ever who was kind enough to
[56:49] bring us here we we ought to consider
[56:51] and ask him what we what he would have
[56:53] us to do
[57:07] the purpose of Us
[57:11] coming to fulfill what he has purposed
[57:14] for
[57:20] us I'm sorry no you're
[57:23] okay
[57:26] and then this is this is where I I found
[57:29] the answer to my
[57:32] question but we seem to be just wanting
[57:36] to keep up with the
[57:45] world I I I believe that's true
[57:49] youth brother sister I mean can you can
[57:52] you are you with me
[57:56] you know and and sometimes you know we
[58:00] we just want to do our own
[58:03] thing or we want to kind of backslide a
[58:06] little
[58:09] bit you know but I truly
[58:14] believe that you're here for a
[58:17] purpose youth it's it's it might be
[58:21] hard it might be hard let me tell you
[58:25] it's
[58:28] possible With God all things are
[58:36] possible my brother can come
[58:40] forward uh if I would just like to leave
[58:42] you with with with a
[58:46] thought something that you can meditate
[58:53] on if God didn't humble
[58:58] himself where would we
[59:01] be God bless your brothers and
[59:07] [Applause]
[59:13] sister may you please stand for a little
[59:15] moment
[59:22] here please the scpt to
[59:28] [Music]
[59:30] John and then we'll jump to 14
[59:40] verse and the beginning was the word and
[59:42] the Word was God and the Word was no and
[59:44] the Word was with God and the Word was
[59:53] God
[59:58] verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and
[1:00:00] dwelt among us and we beheld his glory
[1:00:03] the glory as of the one of the begotten
[1:00:06] of the father full of grace and
[1:00:12] truth now let us go to Ezekiel 36 verse
[1:00:23] 26 you may not have heard
[1:00:27] before but I take them from brother
[1:00:48] brandham say a new heart also will I
[1:00:50] give you and a new spirit will I put
[1:00:52] within you and will take away the Stony
[1:00:54] heart out of your flesh and I will give
[1:00:55] you a heart of
[1:00:59] Flesh this is the new
[1:01:13] birth verse 27 says I will put my spirit
[1:01:16] within you and cause you to to walk in
[1:01:18] my statute statutes and you shall keep
[1:01:21] my judgments and do
[1:01:23] them
[1:01:25] this is the statue of a perfect
[1:01:28] man you may be
[1:01:33] seated I would like to speak a little
[1:01:35] bit about
[1:01:37] Jesus that is the
[1:01:42] theme but when I heard what I
[1:01:47] heard I thought it was a little
[1:01:49] difficult to
[1:01:53] believe knew
[1:01:56] Jesus is not
[1:01:59] God okay I'll explain it now
[1:02:04] okay
[1:02:06] um when Jesus was
[1:02:10] born he born as the he was born as the
[1:02:12] Lamb of
[1:02:14] God and as we read in St John
[1:02:19] 1 the word was made
[1:02:22] flesh but Jesus
[1:02:27] did not have God inside of
[1:02:30] him you might say oh it's because he was
[1:02:33] God he was
[1:02:37] flesh and when John saw
[1:02:39] him and he
[1:02:42] said here is the Lamb of
[1:02:44] God who taketh away the sin of the
[1:02:47] world and he saw the holy spirit in the
[1:02:51] form of a
[1:02:53] dove that's where the
[1:02:55] father dwelt in
[1:03:00] Jesus it's a little bit difficult to
[1:03:03] digest
[1:03:04] okay now let us go to the
[1:03:09] beginning how many of you know that
[1:03:11] Jesus was the second
[1:03:14] Adam so to understand the second
[1:03:18] Adam let us go back to the first Adam
[1:03:21] amen
[1:03:23] amen so let's go to Genesis
[1:03:26] 1 and man is formed
[1:03:30] there and God created him according to
[1:03:33] his
[1:03:35] form according to His
[1:03:38] Image he created male and
[1:03:41] female and God created him there in
[1:03:46] spirit but when we go to Genesis
[1:03:52] 27 it says that God God forms Man Out of
[1:03:55] the Dust of the
[1:03:56] earth
[1:04:00] comma and he he put Breath of Life in
[1:04:05] him brother Bram
[1:04:09] says that when God made man of
[1:04:15] the man walked in the garden of e or on
[1:04:20] Earth without the Holy
[1:04:23] Spirit
[1:04:30] when he said that I said how could that
[1:04:31] be I thought he he had the Holy Spirit
[1:04:34] when but brother
[1:04:36] says that Adam was with a certain time
[1:04:42] before that God placed the
[1:04:45] theop that Holy Spirit the part of
[1:04:48] God in
[1:04:53] man understand that part of the first
[1:04:57] Adam then we can understand the second
[1:05:03] Adam right it's a little bit different
[1:05:05] to
[1:05:06] digest so why do I say
[1:05:11] this to create some
[1:05:12] [Music]
[1:05:15] confusion I want you to understand
[1:05:19] yourselves look
[1:05:22] now we have here man
[1:05:24] in
[1:05:26] flesh with the Holy
[1:05:28] Spirit In the Garden of
[1:05:31] Eden in this
[1:05:34] day he had two
[1:05:37] Natures he had the male
[1:05:41] nature and the female
[1:05:46] nature when Jesus Christ was in
[1:05:50] flesh he had the nature of being a lamb
[1:05:58] when he was baptized by John the
[1:06:02] Baptist the nature of the Dove came
[1:06:04] inside of
[1:06:06] him and now he has two
[1:06:09] Natures the nature of a
[1:06:12] lamb and the nature of a
[1:06:17] dove but man and the first
[1:06:19] Adam
[1:06:23] fell they allowed sin to come into his
[1:06:26] life to come to his
[1:06:28] family to come to his
[1:06:30] home and the
[1:06:33] sin created a separation from
[1:06:37] God and that's what we know
[1:06:42] it we know it as the Fallen state of man
[1:06:44] or the Fallen nature of
[1:06:46] man and in his
[1:06:49] nature every single one of us is born
[1:06:52] with
[1:06:53] it
[1:06:57] it's a nature that has desires of the
[1:06:58] flesh
[1:07:03] okay so we must
[1:07:07] understand that to come to
[1:07:10] get the nature of a
[1:07:13] lamb the nature that Jesus Christ
[1:07:18] had we must be born
[1:07:21] again so we see in Ezekiel
[1:07:28] 3626 that he will give you a new
[1:07:31] heart he gives you a new
[1:07:36] spirit there God gives you the spirit of
[1:07:38] a
[1:07:40] lamb and although you were born
[1:07:44] again you still don't have the Holy
[1:07:49] Spirit and a journey with God
[1:07:52] begins
[1:07:57] I like the way our brother blast started
[1:07:59] and the way brother Timmy
[1:08:03] end explaining a little bit
[1:08:06] on the nature of a
[1:08:11] lamb so then brother BR
[1:08:14] says
[1:08:18] difference between the foolish and the
[1:08:20] true ver the true true bride
[1:08:27] that the
[1:08:29] foolish she has the nature of a
[1:08:33] lamb she never receives the holy
[1:08:36] spirit so then let us go back a
[1:08:42] little before being born
[1:08:46] again we find with a fallen
[1:08:50] nature that constantly desires the
[1:08:52] things of the world
[1:09:00] nature believes all the propaganda that
[1:09:01] the world gives
[1:09:06] ity as the quote that Timmy
[1:09:13] gave that our nature is to have a new
[1:09:16] car of the
[1:09:17] year have a big
[1:09:19] house if it's possible a
[1:09:22] mansion that's all right
[1:09:25] none of that is
[1:09:26] wrong but if you put that in first place
[1:09:29] before
[1:09:31] God then that is
[1:09:34] incorrect but we're born with that
[1:09:37] nature we see the
[1:09:41] children us as
[1:09:44] adults we understand what a young
[1:09:50] man we understand that that young age
[1:09:53] that
[1:09:56] where you find yourself with a
[1:09:58] generation so
[1:10:06] confused by social media
[1:10:09] influencers
[1:10:13] influencers they don't know what to
[1:10:14] believe
[1:10:16] in they don't know what you
[1:10:19] believe they don't even know who they
[1:10:22] are you don't even know what their
[1:10:25] purpose
[1:10:27] is find your purpose
[1:10:31] youth until you are born
[1:10:36] again there is so much confusion in the
[1:10:40] youth also in the
[1:10:45] adults because there's people of 50
[1:10:48] years of
[1:10:49] age who are not born
[1:10:52] again there's people of 60 years of
[1:10:55] age and they still have not been born
[1:11:00] again but if Jesus at 30 years
[1:11:06] old he did not have the Holy
[1:11:11] Spirit what made him free from
[1:11:15] Temptation Temptation was
[1:11:18] there the Bible said he was tempted in
[1:11:22] everything but what was
[1:11:27] it it was the
[1:11:30] word that maintained him
[1:11:32] firm in a
[1:11:35] state where Temptation did not
[1:11:38] Happ he just depended on the
[1:11:42] word that's why
[1:11:45] youth Jesus says to Nicodemus is necess
[1:11:50] it is it is it is necessary that you
[1:11:53] must be born
[1:11:56] again it's not an
[1:11:59] option you must be born
[1:12:03] again because if you are not born
[1:12:08] again you'll be consumed by this
[1:12:11] world so
[1:12:13] then look
[1:12:18] now I say this in a good
[1:12:22] manner and I hope hope you believe my
[1:12:25] word there is
[1:12:27] nothing out
[1:12:29] there that will give you
[1:12:33] life the only
[1:12:35] life that you will
[1:12:38] find is in his
[1:12:42] word I will say
[1:12:44] this not as a
[1:12:47] joke because to me it's as a
[1:12:52] reality
[1:12:55] because brother Bram says here is not a
[1:12:57] place to make
[1:13:00] jok but he says that a man came to the
[1:13:03] Gates of
[1:13:06] Heaven and when he got to the gates of
[1:13:08] Ken he
[1:13:11] saw there was some calm music over
[1:13:20] there and he said he saw a little letter
[1:13:23] board over
[1:13:25] there and it says look what you're
[1:13:27] missing out
[1:13:29] on so C curiy got him got to him and
[1:13:34] went to go
[1:13:36] see he said he had some
[1:13:40] binoculars and he was looking to
[1:13:43] hell and when he saw through the
[1:13:47] binoculars there was a great
[1:13:52] part
[1:13:53] people were
[1:13:58] laughing they were having a good
[1:14:03] time and he left Heaven he went down to
[1:14:06] Hell and when he got to
[1:14:10] hell he found that it was a lake of
[1:14:14] fire that everyone in hell was
[1:14:17] suffering but he already made his
[1:14:22] choice
[1:14:23] but what was that that I
[1:14:26] saw he said it was just
[1:14:31] propaganda and that's the reality that
[1:14:33] devil offers to
[1:14:35] you he offers
[1:14:38] life but in reality he offers
[1:14:43] death
[1:14:45] necessary and I tell you as someone who
[1:14:47] went through that no one told me
[1:14:52] this I know there's only death and death
[1:14:57] and More
[1:14:59] Death where you come to lose your
[1:15:04] personality where you can't even know
[1:15:07] yourself where you can see
[1:15:11] yourself and you can't even get one
[1:15:13] penny to
[1:15:16] yourself you please
[1:15:21] stand although Jesus
[1:15:26] Christ came to have the nature of a
[1:15:30] lamb he came to have the Holy
[1:15:33] Spirit the same Holy
[1:15:36] Spirit left him in
[1:15:42] bet and when he was on the
[1:15:45] cross he said
[1:15:48] father in your
[1:15:51] hands I give you my spirit
[1:15:56] What Spirit was he surrendering on the
[1:15:59] CR it was not the holy
[1:16:02] spirit because the Holy Spirit already
[1:16:04] left
[1:16:08] him it was the spirit of a lamb that
