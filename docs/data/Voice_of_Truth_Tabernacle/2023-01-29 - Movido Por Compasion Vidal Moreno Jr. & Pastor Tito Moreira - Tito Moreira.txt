starting our sermon Celestial Heavenly Father give you thanks Lord for the girl you've been with us we ask you to bless the service is in the same manner the ears of the ears may we live better than how we came in yes glorify your name you have preeminence of our assistance Lord we give you thanks for everything I saw this in the name Lord Jesus Christ amen amen chapter 1 verse 3 reads and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the Captivity there in the province are in great Affliction and reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burnt with fire estas is and it came to a past when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and more on certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of Heaven I'll read one more scripture you can turn to Matthew chapter 9. and we'll be reading verse 36 to 38. here our Lord Jesus Christ speaks to us Matthew 9 36 DC is but when he saw the multitude but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no Shepherd and tons is unto his disciples the Harvest truly as planets but the laborers are few pray therefore the lord of the Harvest that he will send forth laborers into his Harvest you may be seated Brothers for a title uh our pastor alongside myself we've decided to title um our message moved by compassion amen amen find out in the Maya uh noticias he received the news Jerusalem of how the people of Jerusalem are doing uh um and the conditions they live in is we see this new series I believe sometimes when we hear bad news you don't really pay too much attention to those things I think it's happened to all of us we want to ignore the situations foreign [Music] [Music] is slow amen amen yes [Music] to take action s because God gave a great position to Nehemiah um the ray of the king and Don says so when you read the scriptures uh uh was uh take it easier he was in a good position he actually didn't know the people in captivity but something did not let him stay idle amen amen that thing in his heart give him peace amen amen and I believe is a compassion if we do not have that compassion if there is no compassion in us there won't be an effort no no no no other Cambio there won't be a change that's why there's people okay motivate for us get motivated for a season they're just motivated that takes them leads them to take action that's what I believe that's why people cannot live a Christian Life and have success so you don't have that weight in their hearts I was actually streaming and how is it that this is something compassion towards the people is that leads you to take or make an effort foreign my honor today as my father he says when we went to school I am firmly against drinking I remember reading of a man that was born a hundred miles from me a hundred years difference in a little Log Cabin Abraham Lincoln his name was Abraham Lincoln one of the greatest man Kentucky ever produced to my opinion the Abraham Lincoln cuando says and when Abraham Lincoln when he got off off the boat of the boat down in New Orleans Zoo he's seen them auction some color people off as a slave um a big heavy man is poor little wife and children standing out crying him like cattle to bigger heavier women to make better slaves he's a Lincoln Lincoln as many of you know in the history when he folded his hands and smacked them together and said that's wrong and by the help of God if it takes my life and he did amen amen it was something that impacted in La Villa the Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln's life the impact was so great okay that it took him to take an action because I believe when God gave him the privilege to be the president I believe this was one of the reasons for which uh that ego foreign that's the plane the children of God matters but I believe are born again God is places the right motive is and I believe that's what he's done in this [Music] we're all here together working together with a purpose so glorify our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen that's why we are here that's why we couldn't stay where we used to because God calls us in California and I believe they affect this news had on him took him to prayer in French the difference I saw between Elijah and Amaya is Elijah thought he was the last one there was um that would believe as he did Maya corazones that's the reason God can't get a hold of Hearts is because that man won't let him you got your life all choked up with something else some kind of organizations well they got a Revival down at the Methodist or Baptists oh that's not my church I don't go down there he says he says sure you're a member of that tree it is every man that's born again of the spirit of God is a member of the body of Christ amen every man that's born of the spirit of God has that kind of motive towards his Christian Brothers foreign in little bitty things but what difference does that make that doesn't matter the little differences if we can agree or be in one Accord on Jesus Christ we're brothers that's what he says we press on even in families sometimes a husband and wife do not agree that doesn't mean you need a trip to God's altar to get right with God he said well they're down at the church of the open door I belong to the Baptist Church no need me going down there praying for rain he says don't do that if you do you'll never get rained you're close to Heavens again yes sir amen amen uh I keep chill he fled after killing an Egyptian but on this Quest I I ye but after in the desert God started to work with him starts the process of the return because God had to work with him action he took action he took action but it wasn't the right one when you have a calling brother God won't leave you alone [Music] so God takes you uh for you to do your part any one of us here we must have a similar weight that's what I believe similar way because when the Israelites when they were given twice the work so if you have that same way don't complain just carry your clothes God works not just for yourself but for God leave the place God bless you yeah man Mateo Capital Tres you 23 basically verse 37 Mateo Matthew 23 verse 37. when Jesus spoke these words yeah yeah he spoke to the Pharisees his disciples Jerusalem Israel how many times he sent them prophets and how many times he said since righteous Abel hasta Zacharias how many members and the temple oh Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that kills the prophets and stone is them which are sent unto thee cuantas versus how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a hand gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not Libro is a book about Unity when we see these walls being built they're the walls of Jerusalem God sends them together your enemy keeps infiltrating himself is not with one purpose as God tells Jerusalem how many times I wanted to gather you repeat God wants to gather again okay like if you believe it is your neighbor God wants to gather us now when Jesus says he was moved by compassion as David wept Jesus Jesus Jesus did the same thing at this moment we have the privilege to go to the same time I saw the entire city of Jerusalem Jerusalem how many times what does [Music] how about the future he says how Jesus said these words this scripture we just read them says you know as I told you this morning in the breakfast and me diciendo cuantas the Holy Spirit down in me saying how off would I have gathered times foreign do not get along by themselves that's why there's so much [Music] [Music] two or three foreign with the word it says in the indictment is this verse again how God has tried in his in this last days to unite history but you would not foreign together [Music] Martin Luther King Jr Martin Luther King Jr live together separated that's what the devil has done but the message came to unite a brighter because together she won't happen or with branhams yeah no about Korea it won't happen no puedo Korea superstars no Revival [Music] study the book of Nehemiah was United people for everyone to work even made the high priest words the high priest work s the high priest put the whole people to work and what happened the devil didn't stay still foreign brother Branham says it's the second to last quote for paragraph 43. foreign foreign a thing this is pray for them stay with your passengers [Applause] gather the people stop working prophets how a man as myself amen amen hallelujah [Music] gossip Rises that's what happens people I thought the work wasn't fair to do a little and not help the rest does it sound a little like us come on cheers you know what that was that was the Devils seven great attacks on a mile um with love and dignity Unity that's how he overcame allow the people to be led by this gospel you must be careful when you're taking something again when you're speaking against it is using you someone's someone's done meaning and I preach it because I know it I hear it all the time we're killing ourselves the same Jews there were there was fights when he accomplishes that that's right foreign that's all stay right here where you don't want to lose even a hair Salon I watch my hair um and I told her okay I love all of you that's right yes sir okay I don't want one hair to leave her foreign I need all of you what I mean now watch brother Brandon I need to say this as a pastor brother even in marriage and divorce says as I prepare for this message I know this word would cost division he says the truth of marriage and divorce will cause problems myself having friends Ministries I've been married twice or Thrice how can this be when I preach this but then he says don't do it again love one another you could have said okay okay right Doctrine locations differences you think we can find differences amongst everyone here because nobody qualifies I need help it takes for someone to go after Unity for the brothers Grande so make the circle bigger but we'd like to draw but make a bigger Circle to gather his people Jerusalem is the city of Peace Jerusalem means peace peace means don't be fighting that's the only thing you think you're going to help your brother by criticizing him oh you're going to help him by praying and loving him pray foreign can come how many times did I want to gather you but you were not but now I want to tell God lord if I'm criticized if I'm told things but I want you to unite us if there were five men United there were 10 men United States to work together to do forgive pray for your brothers don't speak against them because there's there's no unity in the chain oh there's weakness in the links the entire chain is weak Ness oh brother Brandon says that there will be titled with a chain of circus brother Branham says that chain is a bride the devil cannot come in or just say yeah brother says when she finds out Brian finds out who she is he says she will be an invincible Army amen Invincible Invincible you alone there's Invincible armies an invincible Army I love this is [Music] together they say please see that I
