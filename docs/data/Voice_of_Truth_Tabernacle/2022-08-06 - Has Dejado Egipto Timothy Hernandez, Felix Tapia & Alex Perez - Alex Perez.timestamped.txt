[26:28] [Music]
[26:42] foreign
[26:49] [Applause]
[27:37] you have seen what I did unto the
[27:39] Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's
[27:41] Wings and brought you unto myself
[27:55] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[27:58] indeed and keep my Covenant then shall
[28:00] then you shall be a peculiar treasure
[28:02] unto me above all people for all the
[28:04] Earth is mine
[28:06] one more scripture in the book of Exodus
[28:09] verse 1 and 2.
[28:21] and God spake all these words saying I
[28:24] am the Lord thy God which have brought
[28:26] thee out of the land of Egypt out of the
[28:28] house of bondage
[28:35] we thank you for one more opportunity
[28:40] one more opportunity to surrender
[28:42] ourselves to you
[28:44] and give you more of us
[28:51] as you would be with my lips
[28:54] there would be a blessing to your people
[28:57] put all this in your hands
[29:02] and Savior Jesus Christo
[29:13] we have placed it have you left
[29:16] egyptus Viejas have you left your old
[29:19] ways
[29:22] have you left your old thoughts amen
[29:25] have you left the world
[29:29] or if I could ask you
[29:32] or do you still can uh are you still in
[29:36] bondage
[29:39] because we could have it all but
[29:43] we continue being uh being slaves
[29:48] the people of of Egypt
[29:55] the people of Israel after they had
[29:58] broughten them out of of the Red Sea
[30:02] they had a slave mentality they had a
[30:06] slave mentality
[30:08] it's like being being in a cage
[30:13] where somebody tells you you have it all
[30:16] but you don't you don't get out of here
[30:21] the definition of a slave is
[30:30] it's one who lacks their own freedom and
[30:33] rights because they are absolutely
[30:34] subject to the will and control of
[30:35] another person
[30:39] who was their owner who can buy or sell
[30:42] them as if they were merchandise
[30:51] number two is the person who is
[30:54] dominated by a passion or by a vice that
[30:56] he needs to live or to feel good Israel
[30:59] the people of Israel says
[31:03] in other words
[31:29] it's a great story where the Lord brings
[31:32] the people out of Egypt
[31:39] facing and defeating Pharaoh offices
[31:45] offering a wave Escape through the blood
[31:47] of the land
[31:50] brings out his people
[31:53] and takes them through the through the
[31:55] waters of the Seas
[31:58] into the desert where they would they
[32:00] were complaining and murmuring vemos que
[32:03] dios we see that God
[32:05] he shows his mighty hands
[32:08] he shows what he is
[32:15] what he is capable of doing
[32:19] how many this evening trust in God
[32:28] because I believe if the people of
[32:30] Israel
[32:31] would have trusted in God yes and
[32:35] accepted his grace
[32:38] what would have happened what happened
[32:40] it wouldn't have happened amen all right
[32:42] man the next one is
[32:50] Exodus 19 Verse 6 says and he shall be
[32:53] unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy
[32:55] nation these are the words which Thou
[32:56] shalt speak unto the children of Israel
[32:57] says
[33:04] and Moses came and called for all the
[33:06] Elders of the people respond
[33:10] and then late before they face all these
[33:12] words
[33:15] and the people answered all that the
[33:18] Lord had spoken we will do
[33:21] Pueblo and Moses returned the words of
[33:23] the people unto the Lord
[33:26] and the Lord said unto Moses
[33:34] although I come unto thee in a thick
[33:36] Cloud that the people may hear when I
[33:38] speak with them
[33:40] and believe thee forever
[33:44] and Moses told the words of the people
[33:47] unto the Lord
[33:49] now God is
[33:53] brings the people of Israel
[33:58] he shows him he shows he's manifested in
[34:01] a thick cloud
[34:03] and we see here it's very important
[34:08] because just like the Lord was in that
[34:10] cloud foreign
[34:42] [Music]
[34:43] but like I had I said
[34:50] they left them at the slaves
[34:55] amen
[34:59] in Exodus 32 of verse 1.
[35:21] and when the people saw that Moses
[35:23] delayed to come down out of the mountain
[35:24] the people gathered themselves together
[35:26] unto Aaron and said unto him up make us
[35:28] Gods which shall go before us for as for
[35:31] this Moses the man that brought us out
[35:33] of the land of Egypt we want not what
[35:36] has become of him
[35:39] brother Branham
[35:42] tells us that Moses it was the type of
[35:45] Christ
[36:15] we have our own ideas and we have our
[36:18] own idols amen
[36:23] how is it that is the people of Israel
[36:28] yeah there's even a thing is yours and
[36:31] and God
[36:33] giving them everything
[36:37] even then they they decided to put God
[36:43] they put the Lord who had taken them out
[36:46] of Egypt
[36:47] they set him aside
[36:51] we want nothing to do with you
[37:02] they are contrary
[37:09] they win they made their Idols
[37:13] they said let us live
[37:15] as we lived previously
[37:21] let us live like we lived
[37:25] so that's when they made their Idols
[37:29] if I could put it in a spiritual form
[37:41] the Lord wants
[37:44] muchas
[37:47] he has taken us out of many things
[37:52] at one point we thought we weren't going
[37:54] to come out
[38:00] says as a dog returning to his vomit so
[38:03] will fool return it to his folly
[38:06] as the dog returning to his
[38:10] vomites
[38:13] amen amen
[38:25] sometimes we leave the things but
[38:29] even but but yet
[38:32] we have not left them completely
[38:37] if the people of Israel
[38:41] I could have simply trusted in him
[38:45] if the Voice of Truth Tabernacles
[38:48] could just trust in God
[38:57] [Music]
[39:13] so then
[39:16] we don't allow God
[39:19] to do what he wants to do with us amen
[39:22] amen
[39:48] I know many of us don't want to dwell in
[39:51] dry lands amen amen
[39:54] Glory
[39:57] in the message
[40:01] the
[40:03] Lord keeps all his appointments
[40:07] and just like Israel is
[40:13] when they were shouting the victory at
[40:16] the bank of Jordan yes
[40:21] they were within a four days Germany oh
[40:25] from the promised land is
[40:29] they didn't realize that they were going
[40:31] to take 40 years
[40:33] why was it
[40:37] the grace had provided a prophet for
[40:39] them
[40:42] a lamb of sacrifice a Deliverance
[40:47] but yet they wanted Allah
[40:51] they wanted to be able to do something
[40:56] they wanted to put their hands in it
[41:01] this was the the greatest error that
[41:03] they had committed
[41:07] in Exodus 19 where they rejected Grace
[41:10] and accepted the law and then what did
[41:13] they do
[41:16] he allowed them to stay in the desert
[41:18] for 40 years
[41:29] and they had children there and and for
[41:33] 40 years that's that's where they were
[41:36] God is in our midst Brothers
[41:50] in US
[41:52] amen
[42:01] see
[42:03] if I could put it this way
[42:08] Nosotros
[42:11] are the ones that don't allow God to
[42:14] work in us
[42:16] we don't allow God to move
[42:21] this is because of our old mentality
[42:25] it doesn't allow us to take us
[42:28] that doesn't allow us to advance
[42:31] it leaves us
[42:36] God wants to take us
[42:40] the Lord wanted to take the other people
[42:42] to a Promised Land
[42:47] we are the problem
[42:50] our old mentality
[42:55] amen
[42:58] I am the Lord your God
[43:01] which brought thee out of the land of
[43:04] Egypt
[43:05] out of the house of bondage
[43:08] that's right amen
[43:12] in the message
[43:15] foreign
[43:22] I am grateful this evening with our Lord
[43:25] God
[43:28] that was at one time on Mount Sinai
[43:35] sorry because I have it in English
[43:38] that one stood on the mount and taught
[43:39] the Beatitudes and raised from the dead
[43:41] is in our midst tonight
[43:45] and taught the beauty and raised from
[43:47] the dead is in our midst tonight
[43:51] and it's the same yes he was then
[43:54] yesterday and he foreign
[43:59] and to think that he is the god of
[44:03] Heaven
[44:04] would humiliate himself
[44:07] to come down and associate with such as
[44:10] myself and us here
[44:13] poor people not much of this world's
[44:16] goods
[44:18] and just illiterate
[44:23] and yet he loved me so you know
[44:27] he came down and saved me by his grace
[44:31] nothing I deserve or could not do
[44:35] but he saved me because before the
[44:39] foundation of the world
[44:41] he predestinated me to be safe
[44:45] own foreign
[44:52] [Music]
[45:12] amen
[45:33] thank you
[45:41] God bless you
[45:44] if you can please turn your page
[45:50] to Exodus chapter 16 verse 2. I'll leave
[45:53] it all the eggs
[45:55] I'd like to thank God and the trust for
[45:58] the people put in me um
[46:05] and the whole Congregation of the
[46:07] children of of Israel murmured against
[46:09] Moses
[46:15] may God have blessings to his word
[46:19] I'm going to continue talking about
[46:22] Moses and the children
[46:27] after they they crossed the Red Sea
[46:29] cuando
[46:30] and they began to murmur
[46:34] when they started walking in the
[46:36] wilderness
[46:38] in the wilderness
[46:41] they began to murmur against God and
[46:44] Moses
[46:47] because it was just a dry desert there
[46:52] and they thought you brought us out of
[46:54] out here to die yes
[47:02] and they they they they had thirsts
[47:06] then they had nothing to drink
[47:09] that's what it says in the Bible
[47:12] brother Branham says they begin to
[47:15] complain
[47:17] you took us out of Egypt
[47:21] to stay here and die in the desert
[47:25] you know over there and in Egypt and
[47:28] egito they had a lot of things
[47:31] they had fruit
[47:33] they they they they they had grapes
[47:36] you know they had all kinds of things
[47:39] and there in the desert they found
[47:42] themselves with nothing
[47:44] absolutely and that's why they were
[47:47] complaining
[47:48] you know Pharaoh had just doubled their
[47:52] their tally
[47:57] you know and and they they had more
[47:59] things
[48:01] but Moses was already unified with God
[48:07] and he could see the Promise
[48:10] something that the children of Israel
[48:13] couldn't see I go que Pueblo de Israel
[48:15] because they were still insane
[48:19] even though they were free
[48:24] at that point is punto they wanted to go
[48:28] back
[48:29] and they wanted to be slaves again
[48:33] even though they just had seen the
[48:35] miracle of God
[48:38] of the Red Sea just opening them
[48:42] and they're able to walk through it
[48:48] you know they still wanted to go back to
[48:50] Egypt
[48:52] you know because they had everything
[48:54] there
[48:56] you know Egypt is the type of the world
[49:00] I want to share this quote
[49:05] it's in a message a total Deliverance is
[49:12] okay okay I have it in English bro yeah
[49:17] okay
[49:21] this is that's the way uh Moses and his
[49:25] group did
[49:26] they got over there and got under the
[49:29] blood you notice until they got under
[49:31] the blood there was no total Deliverance
[49:34] Moses himself he was unified with God
[49:37] but Israel wasn't
[49:40] there still was sin and they murmured
[49:43] against Moses and they said why why do
[49:46] you do this you bring more trouble upon
[49:48] us
[49:49] because Pharaoh just doubled their tally
[49:51] of Brixton and so forth that was Moses
[49:54] he was completely in the hands of God
[49:56] totally delivered from the from sheep
[49:58] herding to herd God's sheep he was
[50:01] totally delivered himself but the people
[50:04] wasn't delivered because there there was
[50:06] still murmuring among them
[50:09] they were still complaining
[50:12] even though God delivered them
[50:15] they wanted to go back
[50:18] you know because they couldn't see
[50:20] nothing
[50:21] you know they were just in a dry desert
[50:25] you know there's no water for them to
[50:27] drink
[50:28] and they thirst yeah
[50:32] they want they they wanted to go back
[50:34] and be slaves instead of being having
[50:36] freedom
[50:40] and see and just like today
[50:43] you know we are fortunate to live in a
[50:46] country where there is freedom estamos
[50:48] have been decisions
[50:51] you know but brother Branham says we're
[50:53] a million miles away from being free
[50:58] um
[51:01] the enemy makes us think that we're free
[51:08] he uses that to deceive us
[51:11] he said you have the freedom you want
[51:14] this is
[51:17] and you could do whatever you want
[51:20] here in this place in this free country
[51:26] you have the freedom to have whatever
[51:28] you want
[51:32] come on
[51:34] and that's how he gets in our mind
[51:38] when we make mistakes
[51:41] he says you can't fix it
[51:45] just stay in the world
[51:48] go back to the world
[51:50] you have everything you have there
[51:54] you can have everything you want
[51:57] you're gonna have money you're gonna
[52:01] have drugs you can have whatever you
[52:04] want it is all yours
[52:08] you know it's not worth it being
[52:12] Christiano that's what the devil tells
[52:14] us
[52:15] it's not worth it being a Christian
[52:18] there you don't have all what you have
[52:21] here
[52:24] you you're just there in a dry place
[52:27] you don't have nothing there no tiene is
[52:33] and out here you can have whatever you
[52:35] want yeah
[52:37] and he gets in our minds and he says it
[52:41] is not worth it
[52:43] and just like the children of Israel
[52:48] God is doing great things
[52:51] here at church he's doing he's changing
[52:55] people's lives
[52:57] you know he's doing Miracles here
[53:00] you know he is doing wonderful things
[53:04] you know but there's things they but
[53:07] that the devil doesn't want us to see
[53:08] those things
[53:11] he tells you it's more comfortable to
[53:13] live in the world
[53:16] you know you have it all there
[53:19] [Music]
[53:23] my my
[53:26] he says you are comfortable out there
[53:32] why go to church
[53:34] why Surrender Your Life to God
[53:40] but God wants to take us out of the
[53:42] worldly thing
[53:45] but sometimes we just want to stay there
[53:49] we're closed off we refuse to accept
[53:51] what God is doing is
[53:56] what he wants to do with us
[53:59] he wants to do wonders
[54:01] he wants to do Miracles
[54:04] he wants us to help him change lives
[54:08] he wants us to go and find Souls
[54:12] three there's no salvation for this
[54:14] world
[54:16] you know but there is a lot of Salvation
[54:18] and souls out there
[54:21] are still souls
[54:27] he wants something greater for you
[54:30] he doesn't want it to stop here
[54:33] there's still a long road
[54:41] amen I think it's time that we let go of
[54:44] these things of the world
[54:45] [Music]
[54:47] you know
[54:49] I was thinking the other day
[54:52] you know I need to stop and let go of
[54:55] things
[54:57] and bring other people for my problems
[55:01] um
[55:05] and say and take responsibility for my
[55:08] own problems
[55:10] that it is
[55:13] you know but it is my fault
[55:15] that God cannot do certain things in my
[55:18] life
[55:20] you know that's what we need to do
[55:23] we need to quit blaming the people
[55:25] around us
[55:27] say God it is just me and you he is
[55:32] South we ride brother
[55:34] that's right we need to take God's
[55:37] promises
[55:38] even though we're in the desert
[55:41] and we can't see nothing
[55:44] we just see dried dirt and rods
[55:48] you know we don't see water novemosawa
[55:53] but we need to unite ourselves with God
[55:57] like Moses was United with God
[56:01] even though they couldn't see nothing on
[56:04] chaos
[56:06] even though the Israelite children
[56:08] couldn't see nothing
[56:10] but Moses could see the promises of God
[56:14] you know that's what we need to do
[56:17] look at the promises that God gave us
[56:21] and there is nothing that can take it
[56:24] away from us
[56:25] you know we were meant to be slaves
[56:29] we were meant to be slazier in this
[56:31] earth
[56:36] God made us different
[56:38] it made you unique
[56:41] he made you special
[56:43] even though you don't see it in you know
[56:46] classes
[56:58] your name

[58:38] Israel
[58:41] out of Egypt which is the type of the
[58:44] world
[58:45] it is the same God that can take us out
[58:47] of the world
[58:49] he is the same God that can restore us
[58:52] he is the same God that could make
[58:54] something different

[1:01:40] to the altar uh
[1:01:42] you know it could be you buddy you know
[1:01:46] you can just ask God
[1:01:48] I don't want to be a slave no more
[1:01:52] I don't want to be a slave to this world
[1:01:55] I want to get out of Egypt

[1:02:02] we're going to have a new relationship
[1:02:05] man God bless you amen
[1:02:12] glory to God
[1:02:15] amen I'm gonna ask you to stand um you
[1:02:17] can stretch a little bit
[1:02:19] amen
[1:02:21] numerous
[1:02:24] Numbers chapter 11 verse four amen
[1:02:30] how many are happy for what the Lord has
[1:02:32] already given us amen
[1:02:34] so good with us
[1:02:38] Numbers chapter 11 verse 4 says like
[1:02:41] this
[1:02:42] La Quinte
[1:02:44] extra
[1:02:46] questions
[1:02:58] and the mixed multitude that was among
[1:03:00] them felt a lusting and the children of
[1:03:02] Israel also wept again and said who
[1:03:04] shall give us flesh to eat
[1:03:14] de los pepinos
[1:03:16] de los Melones
[1:03:19] Los pueros
[1:03:21] Los Angeles we remember the fish we did
[1:03:25] eat in Egypt freely the Cucumbers the
[1:03:27] melons and the leeks and the onions and
[1:03:29] the garlic
[1:03:30] bread
[1:03:40] but now our soul is dried away there is
[1:03:43] nothing at all beside this manner before
[1:03:45] our eyes
[1:03:54] God chose Israel
[1:03:57] I like something that brother Eric said
[1:04:00] this is
[1:04:01] that God chose the people of Israel
[1:05:01] honors his word
[1:05:04] [Applause]
[1:05:15] he wanted him to be an example to the
[1:05:18] rest of the Nations
[1:05:20] God had made a covenant with Abraham
[1:05:23] idiots
[1:05:26] and God brought the people of Israel
[1:05:32] okay
[1:05:45] and the reason that God
[1:05:48] has so much patience with us
[1:05:51] because he loves us
[1:05:54] he has chosen
[1:05:57] Foundation
[1:06:02] what you're able to do
[1:06:06] I hope you believe it tonight
[1:06:10] God chooses the people of Israel
[1:06:13] he loves the people of Israel
[1:06:17] God takes the people out from Egypt
[1:06:20] through a prophet
[1:06:22] but the mentality of these people
[1:06:25] as our brothers have said the most
[1:06:29] difficult is
[1:06:31] to leave our old mentality
[1:06:35] God always wants to bless
[1:06:39] but as our brothers say that I've spoken
[1:06:42] nosotroses
[1:06:48] it's no longer God but it's oneself
[1:06:51] that keeps God's blessings away
[1:06:55] it was difficult to leave the old
[1:06:58] mentality
[1:06:59] that mentality
[1:07:02] of leaving your your comfort zone
[1:07:06] you know
[1:07:58] with you
[1:08:08] there's another error that these people
[1:08:11] made when they left
[1:08:12] the Bible says
[1:08:16] in Ecclesiastes
[1:08:20] he says
[1:08:23] what is the cause of the former days
[1:08:26] we're better
[1:08:28] than these
[1:08:50] in other words
[1:09:39] do you know why
[1:09:44] because in US returning
[1:09:47] we're returning
[1:09:50] not only to the mentality
[1:09:56] for 430 years
[1:10:00] they didn't know anything but Egypt
[1:10:03] is that right
[1:10:10] young men and young ladies have
[1:10:13] eggs
[1:10:15] they were born many of them in Egypt
[1:10:19] they grew up around idols
[1:10:27] so many facts
[1:10:33] they grew up with oh I like the way this
[1:10:35] this young man he lets his hair grow
[1:10:38] I like how Pharaoh lets his beard grow
[1:10:41] out
[1:11:09] you are special
[1:11:47] waiting for the Deliverance
[1:12:13] the world
[1:13:14] keep walking
[1:13:28] I die there
[1:13:33] you have to advance
[1:13:36] foreign
[1:14:27] where there is no vision El Pueblo
[1:14:33] the people perish
[1:14:38] when I think of Israel
[1:14:42] and I I I think
[1:14:49] on why they never understood what God
[1:14:51] wanted me to do with them look God loved
[1:14:54] them brothers
[1:14:55] and God loves us
[1:15:06] perhaps it's wrong in my way of thinking
[1:15:10] but I believe that if Israel
[1:15:13] the Commandments of God
[1:15:19] there would have been the most
[1:15:20] tremendous people on the face of the
[1:15:22] Earth
[1:15:24] now our election
[1:15:28] it doesn't determine
[1:15:53] and I believe that we are
[1:16:17] or what God has told us
[1:16:23] God has to send his law
[1:16:26] the law
[1:16:30] s
[1:16:33] the law when God gives it to the people
[1:16:35] of Israel
[1:16:38] for them to understand
[1:16:41] look because with our law there is no
[1:16:43] order
[1:16:45] without a law there's no orders
[1:16:49] give them his word his law
[1:16:53] so like they could understand that
[1:16:55] they're different
[1:16:57] and
[1:17:05] maintenance they maintain the order of
[1:17:09] this church is that correct
[1:17:12] the law brings structure
[1:17:20] Brothers
[1:17:34] they are a person that is is
[1:17:45] the word of God
[1:17:49] reminds me of my position
[1:17:57] then I would be a reckless person
[1:18:02] but the word of God
[1:18:05] my position in Christ
[1:18:10] foreign
[1:18:54] foreign
[1:19:25] [Music]
[1:20:10] there's a manual for my life
[1:20:12] [Music]
[1:20:15] if they would have understood that
[1:20:20] what God wanted to do
[1:20:23] and God had to send a man
[1:20:29] Moses to give them their word
[1:20:34] when you think of Moses you always think
[1:20:37] of the law
[1:20:39] the law was not bad
[1:20:42] did you know that even is
[1:20:49] healthy you'd be skinny
[1:20:52] foreign
[1:21:02] nombre
[1:21:06] right that's sometimes when we think
[1:21:08] about we think of a man that was that
[1:21:11] was so tremendous
[1:21:13] you know he was a man like you and I
[1:21:16] said the only thing that was different
[1:21:18] from Moses is that he believed God
[1:21:23] and he grabbed a hold of the promises
[1:21:28] that's all that you and I have to do
[1:21:30] it's that simple estan simply get a hold
[1:21:33] of his words
[1:21:38] foreign
[1:21:48] on Moses
[1:21:52] I want to say this is the musicians come
[1:21:54] forward
[1:22:00] when Moses began he was a he was a
[1:22:03] rebellious man an angry man
[1:22:06] just as many of us right
[1:22:09] Egyptian
[1:22:16] s
[1:22:18] but along his journey he began to change
[1:22:22] because the trials Brothers
[1:22:28] [Music]
[1:22:30] if you can see it the correct way
[1:22:34] if you visualize this is gonna help me
[1:22:44] of the people of Israel
[1:22:47] and God wanted to kill them
[1:22:50] he wanted to exterminate finish them off
[1:22:54] you know what they're so hard
[1:22:58] we're so rebellious
[1:23:07] because
[1:23:10] everything is changing
[1:23:15] are better than the times you have now
[1:23:18] let's never say that
[1:23:22] both of those beginners
[1:23:43] Moses came to the point in his life
[1:23:45] history
[1:23:47] [Music]
[1:23:58] that was rebellious that was angry
[1:24:02] he began he got to be a man like me
[1:24:06] humble
[1:24:07] [Music]
[1:24:09] Amoroso loving
[1:24:13] is
[1:24:16] willing to give his life

[1:24:33] [Music]
[1:24:41] help us for the better
[1:24:42] [Music]
[1:24:45] that our mentality change
[1:24:48] that our focus is

[1:24:58] as you benefit for your benefit
[1:25:02] do you see how things change is
