[24:48] work Revelation
[24:52] 3:10 Phil we're going to continue with
[24:55] the Philadelphia
[24:57] Church
[25:09] because thou has kept the word of my
[25:10] patience I will also keep thee from the
[25:12] hour of Temptation which shall come upon
[25:14] all the world to try them that dwell
[25:16] upon the
[25:22] Earth behold I come quickly hold that
[25:26] fast which thou Hast that no man take th
[25:48] crown him that overcometh will I make a
[25:50] pillar in the temple of my God and he
[25:52] shall go no more out and I will write
[25:54] upon him the name of my God the name of
[25:56] the city of my God which is New
[25:58] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[26:00] Heaven from my God and I will write upon
[26:02] him my new
[26:07] name he that hath an ear let him hear
[26:09] what the spirit sayth into the churches
[26:11] let us pray Lord Jesus
[26:20] Christ each member that each person that
[26:23] assisted uh we put them in your
[26:27] hands
[26:32] every mind and every heart be in the
[26:34] right
[26:37] place I already hear something from you
[26:42] this most certainly we all need
[26:43] something from
[26:46] you there is no one here that is
[26:48] perfectly
[26:50] right there's something in our soul that
[26:52] is crying
[26:55] out may possibly be that our body may
[26:57] not be
[27:00] but our soul is crying
[27:02] out there's a hunger for you
[27:06] Lord there's a desire for you to help us
[27:08] a little bit
[27:09] more we put ourselves in your
[27:11] hands help us we ask name of the Lord
[27:15] Jesus Christ amen
[27:16] amen may be
[27:21] seated phph trying to get to the end of
[27:24] the Philadelphia
[27:27] Church we've been on Philadelphia for a
[27:29] time
[27:32] now it's a very important a very
[27:34] interesting
[27:38] age and we've been learning on this
[27:40] sixth Church
[27:43] age of the seven that book of
[27:46] Revelations
[27:47] speaks we are on the sixth one Phil
[27:54] Philadelphia and we know and we also are
[27:57] speaking on the sixth virtue
[28:01] the Sixt that second Peter chapter one
[28:04] speaks
[28:06] of six virtue is does anybody
[28:12] remember six
[28:14] virtue
[28:17] godl I go to we
[28:22] forgot we're learning on
[28:25] godliness what does godliness mean
[28:29] Amen to be like
[28:32] God godliness means to be like
[28:35] [Music]
[28:39] God godliness means to be like
[28:50] God so we're getting to the end of what
[28:53] God is telling this church
[28:57] age and he is telling them about the
[29:00] reward the
[29:02] rewards of
[29:05] godliness when you have obtained
[29:08] godliness when you have fought to know
[29:16] him when you have let go of all form of
[29:21] godliness when you have been been real
[29:23] sincere with
[29:25] God and you see him real in your life
[29:29] you get to
[29:31] Godliness there are rewards there are
[29:38] benefits there are things that God gives
[29:42] us there's a reason why God wants us to
[29:44] get to
[29:46] Godliness it's not just to have
[29:49] godliness it's because there's benefits
[29:51] for the child of
[29:53] God and he begins to say in verse
[29:57] 10
[29:59] because thou has kept the word of my
[30:00] patience in other
[30:03] words because you have kept my
[30:06] name you have kept what I said what I
[30:10] am you grabbed hold of
[30:15] it he says I will also keep thee from
[30:17] the hour of
[30:19] Temptation let me tell
[30:23] you that there are times when
[30:26] you you take care of what God has G
[30:28] given
[30:31] you there are moments where he is the
[30:33] one that is keeping
[30:36] you in the message the unconditional
[30:39] Covenant that God made with the
[30:42] people
[30:46] says someone said brother Bram when you
[30:49] was
[30:49] off those eight
[30:53] months was going through some difficult
[30:56] times some hard
[30:59] times and he was out for eight
[31:03] months he wasn't in in the
[31:12] work that time I almost to break down
[31:14] he's almost
[31:16] collapsed almost
[31:19] died says did you keep no did you keep
[31:21] your
[31:23] religion words did you keep your
[31:26] religion
[31:31] says says no
[31:36] sir my religion kept me in other
[31:40] words My Religion kept
[31:46] me let me tell you we're all going to
[31:48] get to a point in our
[31:49] lives where we've given great
[31:52] effort we have
[31:54] struggled we've done the best we
[31:56] could
[31:59] and even then we will fail many
[32:02] times our efforts our strength won't be
[32:05] able
[32:06] to our strength won't be
[32:09] enough we'll
[32:11] realize that in those moments God
[32:15] says because you give
[32:19] efforts because you gave the best that
[32:21] you
[32:23] could now I will keep
[32:26] you
[32:29] come on Brothers this isn't just
[32:32] anything this isn't just anything
[32:34] brother
[32:36] VI he keeps
[32:39] us when we can't keep
[32:43] him for our strength isn't
[32:48] enough he says because you've done the
[32:50] best you
[32:52] can because you have believed in
[32:55] me because you've continued believing
[32:59] perhaps your strength is
[33:02] little but now I will take care of
[33:05] you now I will keep
[33:10] you when he should have left
[33:13] us when he should let us
[33:16] go he says I will not let you go I will
[33:20] keep
[33:22] you because you've done the best you
[33:26] can how tremendous
[33:29] I begin to think a little
[33:31] bit on
[33:34] Noah how many times he perhaps wanted to
[33:37] give
[33:38] [Applause]
[33:43] UPS perhaps you may said I I I spent a
[33:45] long time building this
[33:48] Ark how many how many
[33:50] days I
[33:52] imagine getting there with his hmer with
[33:55] his
[33:56] saw and the
[34:00] wood and the construction of the
[34:05] Ark maybe he uh he he took a deep
[34:09] breath he said do I want to continue or
[34:13] not 120
[34:16] years 120
[34:21] years or not have you ever come to
[34:26] service you're on the bench but it seems
[34:28] like you're there but you're
[34:31] not perhaps you may have wanted to go
[34:33] back
[34:36] home let me tell you but you you you
[34:38] remain there you you you stay
[34:42] there Lord I'm going to do everything
[34:44] possible do the best that I
[34:49] can and when Noah was going through that
[34:51] great
[34:53] storm he was going through the hour of
[34:56] Temptation he may have said
[34:59] the good thing is I didn't give
[35:02] up good thing is I kept going to
[35:05] service one day you will
[35:09] say the good thing is I kept going to
[35:12] service per may be difficult
[35:17] right it may seem that you you don't
[35:20] what are you so worried about but one
[35:23] day you will look
[35:25] back when you see the others
[35:29] the others thrown along the
[35:32] way Great Tribulation comes upon this
[35:35] Earth You will say thank you
[35:37] Lord that you kept
[35:40] me that I continued going to
[35:44] church come on
[35:49] Church stay strong this this
[35:53] evening if you're planning on giving up
[35:55] just just keep going forward
[35:58] one day it will be worth
[36:06] it one day it will be worth
[36:11] it says because I was kept the word of
[36:14] my
[36:20] patience I will also keep thee from the
[36:22] out Temptation which shall come upon all
[36:25] the
[36:26] world
[36:28] to try them that dwell upon the
[36:31] Earth God will not ask
[36:35] you to do something that you are unable
[36:37] to
[36:38] do he will take care of
[36:42] that but he will ask of you to do what
[36:45] you
[36:46] [Applause]
[36:48] can you may you may not be able to do
[36:50] anything in that
[36:52] day the day of Great
[36:55] Tribulation the great and terrible day
[36:57] of the Lord
[36:59] you won't be able to do much on that
[37:01] day but now is when you can do
[37:04] something today is when you can do
[37:07] something right now is when you can say
[37:09] Lord help me right now I want to serve
[37:13] you
[37:14] now I want to do what I can right
[37:18] now and when that day
[37:22] arrives that you and I won't be able to
[37:24] do a whole
[37:26] lot you will be able to say Thank You
[37:30] Lord because now you will keep
[37:36] me it's worth it to serve
[37:40] God it's worth it to
[37:44] give it's worth it to read our
[37:50] Bible lamp is a is a
[37:55] Light lamp is is your to my
[38:00] feet that's what keeps
[38:02] us it may seem like nothing is
[38:07] happening say what good does he do to
[38:09] come to service or
[38:11] read but let me tell you a little by
[38:14] little you are building your
[38:18] Ark you are constructing what will take
[38:20] you to heaven little by
[38:23] little you are
[38:26] constructing
[38:28] you are fighting for your
[38:32] salvation amen
[38:35] amen sometimes it seems like we're
[38:37] crawling but at least we're
[38:43] going verse 11 he says behold I come
[38:49] quickly hold that fast which thou Hast
[38:51] that no man take that
[38:54] Crown says I come
[38:56] quickly
[38:59] I believe he's coming quicker than we
[39:00] can
[39:02] imagine he's coming quicker than we
[39:05] think do not get
[39:08] relaxed it's the most difficult
[39:11] time but don't
[39:14] relax there's not a whole lot of time
[39:16] left there's not a lot of time left
[39:19] church the more difficult that seems to
[39:23] get that is the evidence that there's
[39:25] not a whole lot of time help me
[39:28] God in these difficult
[39:34] times remember why I'm doing what I'm
[39:38] doing there's not a whole lot of time
[39:40] left grab hold of it grab hold of what
[39:43] you
[39:45] can grab hold of your
[39:54] faith he says behold I come quickly
[39:58] then verse 12
[40:00] says him that
[40:06] overcometh will I make a pillar in the
[40:08] temple of my
[40:16] God pillar is in English call them in
[40:20] Spanish call them in
[40:23] Spanish says he that him that
[40:26] overcometh will I make a a
[40:31] pillar brother Bram says in the
[40:33] Philadelphia Church
[40:34] age this
[40:37] pillar a pillar or a
[40:41] foundation foundation in the temple the
[40:44] house or the house of God the Temple of
[40:47] my
[40:48] God or the house of my God it's a pillar
[40:53] the
[40:56] foundation
[40:58] these are those that took the word which
[40:59] they heard in verse
[41:02] eight and went back to the
[41:06] foundation he's speaking on of a pillar
[41:08] of a
[41:11] column know something that that holds up
[41:13] the the the
[41:19] building surely connected to the highest
[41:21] part of the building and the
[41:23] lowest a pillar is
[41:26] connected
[41:29] of the the structure of of the
[41:31] frame it is so
[41:35] essential it is what strengthens the
[41:39] building is what can uphold the
[41:43] weight and it's connected to the
[41:47] foundation and to the whole
[41:49] structure from the top to bottom that is
[41:53] the pillar brother bam says it's a
[41:57] column
[42:02] these are those which took the word and
[42:03] they heard it and and went back to the
[42:07] foundation he says now let's get
[42:09] Ephesians
[42:11] 2:19 over at the church of Ephesus you
[42:14] know you have to go back to
[42:16] Ephesus that was the beginning is that
[42:20] right let's go back to Ephesus where
[42:23] Paul
[42:24] was the church that he established
[42:28] and let's see now where we're
[42:30] at the church of
[42:35] Ephesus let's go back now and see what
[42:37] this Foundation is back
[42:39] there see what Paul said about the
[42:43] foundation back in that first church age
[42:47] there now he's talking to the
[42:56] Ephesians
[42:58] now therefore you are no more strangers
[42:59] or foreigners but fellow citizens with
[43:01] the saint and of the household of
[43:10] God and are built upon the foundation of
[43:13] the Lutheran of or or the Baptist now
[43:15] wait I got mixed up didn't I
[43:21] oh but are built upon the foundation of
[43:23] the Apostles and
[43:26] Prophets
[43:27] Jesus Christ being himself the Chief
[43:31] Cornerstone everything went in at the
[43:33] door
[43:36] Jesus and he that overcometh will I make
[43:38] him a
[43:39] pillar in other
[43:42] words part of the
[43:45] foundation what does a pillar
[43:49] mean means to be a part of the
[43:53] foundation going back to the
[43:56] foundation
[43:57] being
[43:58] connected to the
[44:00] original let me tell
[44:02] you if we need something right
[44:06] now connect to the
[44:12] original I want the modern
[44:15] Doctrine I want the original
[44:18] doctr the original
[44:20] word the original life come on
[44:25] Church Jesus Christ
[44:28] yesterday today and
[44:30] forever I don't want another Jesus
[44:34] Christ want the original Jesus
[44:40] Christ I will make you a
[44:43] pillar you will be a part of the
[44:47] foundation says what will I give
[44:53] him I'll put him in the do in the
[44:56] doctrine of the the apostles and
[44:57] prophets from the
[44:59] beginning and give him the
[45:02] Revelation what the prophets say about
[45:04] him counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God
[45:09] Everlasting father oh church I don't
[45:13] know if you're understanding what the
[45:14] prophet's
[45:17] saying will have the same Revelation
[45:19] that the apostles
[45:21] hadu I don't know if you believe that or
[45:25] not perhaps you don't desire it
[45:28] but who what kept
[45:30] them what made them what they
[45:34] were because they were men that were so
[45:36] filled with the holy
[45:37] spirit because why why were they men
[45:40] filled with the Holy
[45:44] Ghost because they had the right
[45:47] Revelation they understood something of
[45:51] God knew the Lord Jesus
[45:54] Christ face to face they walked with him
[45:58] they were with him they knew his
[46:03] nature the word of God says
[46:05] here if you obtain
[46:08] godl I will connect you you will
[46:12] understand what the apostles
[46:19] understood this isn't just
[46:21] anything this isn't just anything
[46:25] Brothers
[46:27] that's to have the
[46:29] Revelation that the apostles
[46:34] had the ones that laid the foundation
[46:37] the
[46:38] pillars of this
[46:41] gospel you become one with
[46:44] them

[46:49] big for you or
[46:51] not you are a part of the
[46:54] structure and you understand
[46:58] what they
[47:00] understood it's
[47:04] difficult for
[47:07] example somebody new that comes into
[47:09] this
[47:10] church it's difficult for them to
[47:16] understand what it means to be here
[47:19] today to have this
[47:22] building somebody new
[47:24] arrives and they come and sit down
[47:29] they don't understand the beginnings of
[47:31] a Voice of Truth
[47:34] Tabernacle
[47:37] they they weren't
[47:41] there they weren't there
[47:44] when when God placed on my
[47:48] heart to to initiate or start Voice of
[47:51] Truth
[47:52] Tabernacle
[47:54] move from one place to another
[47:58] to help my father and to
[48:03] start Voice of Truth
[48:06] Tabernacle they don't
[48:11] understand what it
[48:14] was to have services at 3:00 p.m.
[48:17] because that's when they rented the
[48:18] building to us in a small
[48:20] room we couldn't have services in the
[48:24] morning they don't understand
[48:30] but it
[48:32] was when we moved to
[48:36] Colorado to just leave everything
[48:38] forsake
[48:39] everything and start over
[48:45] again they don't
[48:48] understand when we cried out for a new
[48:50] building a place of our
[48:54] own someone that barely arrived
[48:59] they don't understand those
[49:02] pains understand those sufferings those
[49:06] moments until they begin to
[49:10] connect to the
[49:15] church they begin to
[49:17] understand where we come
[49:20] from what we've gone through it hasn't
[49:23] been
[49:25] easy
[49:28] what the apostles went through wasn't
[49:30] easy they gave their
[49:33] life they gave their
[49:36] life they literally gave their
[49:40] life they literally
[49:44] paid sufferings and
[49:48] lashings so you and I could be here
[49:53] today they rejected them they mocked
[49:57] them look at them for a
[50:00] moment look at Paul how many times they
[50:05] tried to kill they put him in
[50:07] jail look at him
[50:10] incarcerated with
[50:14] cold and once they let him
[50:17] go he wouldn't stay
[50:21] still he continued and he looked for
[50:23] another
[50:24] place to go and take the
[50:32] gospel many times we don't
[50:36] understand because we're here
[50:40] comfortable we don't
[50:43] understand where it all
[50:47] began and God
[50:50] says I'll give you
[50:52] understanding I will connect you to the
[50:56] foundation
[50:57] to the beginning of
[51:01] everything you will not
[51:11] understand significance of the moments
[51:14] of
[51:19] success unless you've been a part of the
[51:22] lowest
[51:25] times
[51:27] until you've experimented the low
[51:31] moments you won't understand the the the
[51:34] the high moments the High Times the good
[51:39] times a pillar somebody something that's
[51:41] connected to the low and to to the to
[51:43] the high
[51:47] parts something someone that not not
[51:49] only uh not only understands the moments
[51:51] of
[51:53] success but someone that understands the
[51:56] lowest moments as
[51:59] well when everything we see was not here
[52:03] yet there was a
[52:07] foundation there was something
[52:10] solid something that was
[52:14] founded that's what a pillar grabs hold
[52:17] of of those low
[52:20] moments of the difficult
[52:24] moments you won't understand
[52:31] for example you you'll never
[52:35] understand what it means to uh to see
[52:38] the grace of God in your
[52:46] life unless you connect with that Jesus
[52:49] that was
[52:51] crucified through by which came the
[52:55] grace
[52:59] you have to see the pain that Jesus went
[53:05] through you have to connect yourself
[53:07] with that
[53:09] cross you have to connect with every
[53:12] lash that he
[53:14] received every all the pain he
[53:19] felt when he felt as though every bone
[53:22] was
[53:24] breaking if you don't connect to that
[53:28] you don't understand the grace you don't
[53:30] appreciate
[53:32] Grace that's why Grace becomes a
[53:36] disgrace because people have not
[53:38] understood what theyve
[53:41] received don't understand what Jesus did
[53:43] for us oh
[53:45] Brothers if we need something
[53:49] today connect with what he did for
[53:53] us connect with the cross
[53:57] connect with the great love he
[54:00] had for you and
[54:03] I brother
[54:07] brandom he says in the message the
[54:09] Mighty God unveiled before
[54:12] us he says I was with John the
[54:15] Baptist and before them
[54:20] critics I seen the spirit of God
[54:25] descending I heard the voice of God
[54:28] say this is my beloved
[54:30] Son in whom I'm well
[54:33] pleased yes
[54:37] sir I sure was identified with him
[54:41] that's exactly
[54:44] right was identified there at at the
[54:47] grave of
[54:48] Lazarus when he raised up
[54:51] [Music]
[54:52] Lazarus I was identified with the woman
[54:54] at the well
[54:57] when he told her her sins yes
[55:01] sir I surely was
[55:04] identified with him and his
[55:07] death and I was
[55:09] identified with him in
[55:12] his first EAS I raised with him from
[55:18] Death you have to identify
[55:23] yourself with that
[55:25] moment
[55:28] when he
[55:29] gave life and
[55:32] hope to a world full of
[55:36] Darkness that that had no
[55:41] Redemption had no fellowship with their
[55:44] creator you need to
[55:47] identify and say had it not been for
[55:49] him I would not be
[55:55] here
[55:56] how can you
[55:59] identify you have to have the same
[56:02] Spirit you have to have that
[56:07] spirit that makes you do the same things
[56:09] that he
[56:11] did oh
[56:14] Brothers everyone can
[56:16] say if I had been there that
[56:19] day if I was there at that
[56:22] moment I wouldn't have denied the Lord
[56:25] Jesus
[56:26] but we deny him
[56:28] daily we deny him even when we come to
[56:31] church
[56:34] yes sometimes there's unbelief amongst
[56:40] us we are
[56:45] standing we are
[56:49] standing with that great
[56:52] multitude that heard
[56:54] him on on that
[56:57] M when he gave that great
[57:01] preaching of the
[57:05] Beatitudes there at the Sea of
[57:13] Galilee put yourself
[57:16] there what do you think of
[57:19] him what do you think of that
[57:25] man

[57:30] man that said that said blessed are
[57:33] those that are poor in
[57:36] spirit what do you think of that bearded
[57:42] man what do you think of
[57:46] him will you follow
[57:49] him will give will you give your life
[57:52] for
[57:55] him
[57:57] will you just be one of those that heard
[58:00] him and you went
[58:04] home and that that was the end of
[58:11] it I don't want to be like
[58:16] that I want to be with those that
[58:18] followed
[58:20] him brother brandham
[58:25] says was with the 120 in the upper
[58:32] room I was identified up there with him
[58:35] with

[59:22] not perhaps we haven't waited enough
[59:27] perhaps we're with those that get
[59:29] desperate we get impatient
[59:39] impatient and we may say perhaps it's
[59:42] not for
[59:45] me who do you identify
[59:55] with
[59:57] it's until that same
[59:59] spirit is in
[1:00:06] us that we begin to connect with the
[1:00:11] 120 there's something in
[1:00:15] us if we are a part of him
[1:00:18] Brothers there's something that will
[1:00:20] connect
[1:00:23] us something that may that will say if

[1:07:59] generation to receive the holy spirit in
[1:08:01] their
[1:08:03] generation see
[1:08:10] yes we will not be an exception to
[1:08:14] that God
[1:08:18] says you have to live the same
[1:08:21] life you have to suffer the same
[1:08:24] way
[1:08:26] to pay the same
[1:08:32] price it's not so that we would be
[1:08:35] slothful
[1:08:39] brothers they didn't pay the price so
[1:08:41] that we could be slothful or
[1:08:47] lazy I I there are millionaires
[1:08:53] that they leave everything for their
[1:08:55] children
[1:08:58] and they never have to
[1:09:00] work they never have to give an
[1:09:03] effort but brother brandom says that God
[1:09:06] doesn't have
[1:09:08] grandchildren he has original sons and
[1:09:13] do and everyone has to come the same
[1:09:19] manner have to come in the same manner
[1:09:22] if Paul
[1:09:24] fought pet was
[1:09:28] crucified if James was cut in
[1:09:31] half imagine being sought in
[1:09:38] half if they had to do that then who are
[1:09:42] we to have an easy life
[1:09:46] Brothers perhaps they won't saw you in
[1:09:50] half

[1:10:04] life for this
[1:10:11] message you have to show that you're a
[1:10:13] child of
[1:10:16] God We complain about the
[1:10:19] problems complain about our
[1:10:22] life oh Lord forgive us
[1:10:25] forgive
[1:10:27] us it's time to connect
[1:10:31] ourselves to what they were in the
[1:10:34] beginning to what the true child of God
[1:10:38] is to feel what they
[1:10:41] felt to understand
[1:10:45] them to understand someone you have to
[1:10:48] go through the same
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:54] thing and we're
[1:11:00] suffering and we're we're we're become
[1:11:03] traitors it seems

[1:11:43] give it all for
[1:11:46] him doesn't matter the price I have to
[1:11:50] pay it is worth
[1:11:54] it
