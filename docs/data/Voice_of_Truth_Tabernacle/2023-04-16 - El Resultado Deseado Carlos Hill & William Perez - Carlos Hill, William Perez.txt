morning it's a privilege to be here in the house of the Lord with you all this morning it's a privilege to see another part of the bride of Christ this morning to be able to address you all is such a such a wonderful privilege such a wonderful thing amen amen so so happy to be here with you guys we had such a wonderful time yesterday at the wedding it was it was fantastic we we had an awesome time so thank you all very much and and we feel at home I feel like I'm at home I hope you don't mind if I make myself comfortable all right not taking too much more time let's get right into the word this morning we had a tremendous time this morning at the eight of clocks if you would turn in your Bibles to to the Book of Daniel chapter three and and this morning we want to talk about a a topic this morning and that's producing the desired result yes you see we come to church and and we we receive our salvation and a lot of times we we don't know maybe what what the result of of coming to church should be sometimes we we become a Christian by name and we're not sure what the desired result is we reach certain points in our journey along the way and we're not sure what the desired result should be okay so this morning we want to understand what's a desired result what are we supposed to be doing what is the the word of God supposed to be doing in our lives The Book of Daniel chapter 3 verse 15. and it's a story that we know very very well this is the story of Shadrach Meshach and abedna it says and I just want to read the last part of the of 15. and it says and this is Nebuchadnezzar speaking and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hand answered and said to the Kings we are not careful to answer thee in this matter response and may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word and you may be seated now verse 17 says our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thy hands you see there's something significant about the Shadrach Meshach and Abednego stories a lot of times we think about these three young men that's just three Israelites that were scared and terrified of what was about to happen but I want you to know that that's not the case you see these three young men and I learned so much about the way that the Israelites and the Jews think and operate you see from the time there's three or four years old these young men sit in front of the Wailing Wall foreign [Music] that is to you see they purposed within themselves to create a situation that would produce desired results and they knew the statue would be a solid gold and they began to do their research and they're plotting and they're planning and they said we will produce a situation what's the result that we look for Esperance because we want to see him how many of us walk every day what's the desired result of my salvation [Music] can be made manifested but these young men approached nebuchadnezzars and when everyone else us three young men still standing and they knew Nebuchadnezzar was going to call them up and they knew Nebuchadnezzar had a foul temper it is why the Bible tells us there were Nebuchadnezzar approach them they said we are prepared for this question we are ready for your for your for your trouble for your problems and we're ready to give you an answer in a certain way and if you notice the answer that they returned to Nebuchadnezzar is it wasn't an answer of well you know we're we're we're sorry they were confident where they stood they were men on a mission they would be stopped by nowhere and they walked up to the king of that area look keep squaring the eyes and they said we will not Bowser says but you know these young men they had something on their minds because they knew something that they had learned from studying they knew that there's a certain number that produced the results and they looked back in the laws and they saw that on in Genesis it was on the seventh day foreign [Music] [Music] better Elijah said I see a cloud about the size of a man's hands and they knew that was Joshua when they got to Jericho they knew that it was the seventh time around that they would blow the trumpet seven times and so when they went before Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar said heat the furnaces but do you know what kind of furnaces they were gold smelting furnaces they were made to Smite to smelt the gold that was used for the Statue gold melts at 1948 degrees but that wasn't hot enough I gotta get that furnace harder temperatures foreign [Music] [Music] thirteen thousand degrees is the three young men understood there's only one thing that runs at 13 000 degrees and that is the core of the earth yes [Music] and I knew it had to be heated seven times [Music] it's just about right right now [Music] I can feel myself going out I can feel the heat of the Holy ghosts just about right now thought he was doing something incredible so he says throw them in the furnace and when he throws them in the first they go in Three Men and they look again and it even Nebuchadnezzar who had studied the word of God because when he saw the Fourth Man when he saw that first man wow [Music] it wasn't by chance it wasn't just a coincidence that they ended up in a furnace they created the situation in which the Holy Ghost as the Son of God could be made manifests in their very days ahead of his scheduled time [Music] [Music] [Music] they drew him to himself I'm sorry for those of you sitting in the front row that's the Splash Zone so I apologize but they created an environment [Music] your dispensation that was a time of God above us sovereign [Music] [Music] is the Hope wow come on Amen brother Branham makes a statement mono Branham this says though and he says the sickest body is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ but you know if you only take that so far you lose half the revelations because if I take that statement and I say it's the body of the Lord Jesus Christ out there I haven't recognized my day in its message but when I look at it and I say this body is the sickest body then it changes the whole entire Outlook because now I'm looking inwardly the Bible says let every man examine everybody else around him no sir no Senor the Bible says let every man a woman a child examine ourselves [Music] let us all check ourselves that's what Paul is so tremendous because you hear people say I remember the day that I died and as tremendous as that is my question to that is simply this is [Music] some new situation in my life that does not line up with God that will not produce the desired result [Music] and when I find that so I die that day and then tomorrow I'll find something else [Music] but Christ still lives then I don't do and don't says what I want to do look at your kiddo I do what is necessary to produce the desired results the person of Jesus Christ to manifest the life that he lives yes esto is Jesus Christ the only difference is today he's wearing this suit I did not praise the Lord amen can we produce the desired results forgive me for screaming I just get excited this is life is the spirit is this is our day this is our dispensation before the foundation of the world each and every one of you chose because you understood just like Shadrach Meshach that in the seventh Church age and lost yeah cooked Seven Seals that there was seven trumpets that there was seven angels that would show themselves in the clouds and even though you can't remember because I see the desired results being produced in a way that it had never been produced before and we stood there you said before the foundation of the world and we said all those Seven Seals it is how those Mysteries oh it says mysterious they were hidden Escondidos oh I can see them start to unfold in that day oh that's seventh messenger oh it says Jesus told Peter Jesus Upon This Rock sobre esta Piedra I built my church yes but when we hear it we always think of a stone cold dead lifeless rocks but that's not the rock Jesus was talking about he was referring the 13 000 degrees because it doesn't matter who I get around it doesn't matter who I get around uh if I get around a brother who's called say yes it doesn't matter because I've got molten lava I've got love of the Holy ghosts it's gonna ignite my brother it doesn't matter where I go I don't know because I'm not afraid because upon the rock of Revelations I stand upon that rock um amen and we are able it's almost capacity to produce the producer the desired result for Our Generation for our dispensation we are able to Worship in spirit and a spiritual and in truth we are able to call that same Messiah that the Shadrach Meshach and Abednego I said able to bring him on the scene just like they did so why then do we walk around as defeated broke down Christians it's because we've never recognized what lives inside of each and every morning Nosotros you've never been able to see that core that's inside of it is hot and churning and going Caliente is just anxious to spread the love of Jesus Christ but it's time it's high time that we bring God out of History it's high time that we live in our distance that we worship in our district and that we become a manifested son or daughter of God to a Dying World it's nobody else's problem it's mine and yours that's why we're here may God bless you [Applause] my goodness we've heard some fire today amen God bless Brother Carlos Carlos what a word from Brother Marcos this morning you know whenever you can start the day off hearing from the Throne of God it's always a good day Amen brother Titus I want to thank you for the opportunity this this morning you know I I bring greetings from our pastor brother Caleb saludos for my father is Junior um the rest of the ministry and the Saints there in Las Cruces in Las Cruces and they wanted me to tell you that they love you and I bring special greetings from our brothers in Uganda they wanted me to uh to tell you all okay that they thank you for loving Uganda special uh greetings brother Titus to brother Marshall and brother Alex I know they've gone in the past and they said they were extremely blessed by their Ministries amen I'm happy this morning to have my wife and then God bless you thank you all those that came from Las Cruces God bless you can stand as well you know this this week has been a peculiar week and and I thank God for something uh on Thursday and I thank God for something yesterday you know on Thursday was uh was the wedding of my niece and I saw my my brother-in-law walk her down the aisle yeah and I said my goodness I could never do that so at least with not drenching the aisle in tears [Music] and then I saw again brother brother Alex she's walking his daughter down Alex I said my goodness thank you for giving me boys because I could never have done that without sharing many many tears but those that have done that may God bless you okay you guys are amazing hey man let's turn into our description this morning we're gonna we're gonna go into the book of lukeas chapter 22. I'm gonna ask you to stand we're gonna stand for the reading of the word this morning we're going to go to Luke 22. verses 24 through 27 verse it says and it reads this and there was also a Strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated you know so many times in in our in our uh Church Life you know I've I've seen this so so often your lawn growing up as a son of a pastor Christian there's there's always Strife among uh among menombres of who is uh who is the closest with the pastor thank God that doesn't happen here that's only a New Mexico praise the Lord for that so Strife who's the closest with the pastor Del Pastor they say well I've been with the pastor the longest December is I've been with him since the beginning oh but look at me open up meet him at me I've given more to the ministry than anybody else and you start getting complexes amongst the Brethren usted you start getting Strife amongst the brethrens of who is the greatest of who's the best and I can see these uh these disciples well look at me not only am I a fisherman but I am an entrepreneur you know I I employ other fishermen I can see Judas maybe come up well that's that's that's pretty good but um I'm the accountant [Music] I take care of the funds of uh of the ministry well uh Matthew might have gotten up a little bit he said you know what I'm pretty educated you know there's not many of us that were tax collectors as he's hearing them amongst themselves this is what he says and he said unto them verse 25 the kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise Authority upon them are called benefactors verse 26 but ye shall not be so verse says but he that is greatest among you know let him be as the younger Como El Mas Joven and I I'm pretty sure this was addressed to to Peter yes and he that is Chief as he that doth serves for weather is greater he that sitteth at meat um we like to be served right we like to go to uh to the Texas Roadhouse Texas Roadhouse you know we got it got a little extra cash we had a good week at work Beverly take you out you know take you out tonight we get there sit at the table all right bring the bread what do you mean you only brought me five five pieces of bread this is a Texas Roadhouse I need at least 10 or 12. right this is Texas Roadhouse so there you are please refill my uh my tea please Anton sir Siesta por favor yes I'll take another and that and that uh that way of being served yes so often times not only does it does it hinder us in our natural life but it hinders us in our spiritual life I've seen so often times where where there's people that have that have served the Lord or that that have come to church I should say okay for years and years and all that they're doing oh my goodness for weather is greater he that sitteth that meat or he that service is not he that sitteth and Me Greater La Mesa isn't that what Jesus is saying isn't isn't the one that is being served greater Jesus he says but I am among You parody as he but imagine one thing God in flesh and carne he came in a way that the Sadducees that the Pharisees they were so blinded or I should say maybe they were so blindsided at the way that Jesus came you know they expected a man to come okay sit on the throne people waving palms and make sure he's he's all right and cool Las personas they expected somebody that was royalty but what they got you was just a humble man serving oh my goodness so many times muchas versus you know I remember growing up I had a bad complex and I want to share something personal with you this morning that's all right you know when you're when you're at somebody's house you know when I go to brother Carlos's house I take off my shoes you know I I put the couch back a little bit it gets served some iced tea he makes me feel at home but that's the way that we feel here but uh we can just be ourselves this morning so growing up Crescendo I had a I had a complex I had a complex well my dad's the pasture so whatever you give to the pastor well that should be given to me as well imagine that you've served the pasture Pastor hey hey it's my dad that's me papa you serve me as well so there I go Antonio a big shot right Persona Grande everybody knows who my dad is what's your dad's name again of yes I want to be servedo but I never realized and I never saw or I shouldn't say I never saw but I I was blinded by my own by my own thoughts I wouldn't would see my dad in a certain way but when he would go on the missionary film and he was there with people in all hours of the morning in a hospital the way he served you know sometimes we see great ministers and we see him in a certain light we see him in a certain way but we have no idea sometimes what they go through to serve God's people you know that's what Jesus was trying to get to the disciples he even brought in our little child we're going to go to uh Mark 9 33.3 we'll actually go with verse 36. then he took a child and set him set him in the midst of them and when he had taken him in his arms he said unto them whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name is and whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me Manville what a thing it is once again for God in flesh to serve his people you know what it brings me to something a few years ago I was I was uh I was reading in the book of Isaiah and we could turn to it right now the book of Isaiah chapter 40. verse 31. and I read this and I I this was one of the first um first scriptures that my uh that I remember as as as a boy that my mother taught me [Music] and it reads that reads like this but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not think and I remember reading that the Lord brought this to my attention and I read it and I said but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength wow that's awesome thank you Lord foreign because that's not it it is you're not you're you're not catching what I'm trying to show you I want you to read it slow and I want you to change the perspective that you see of this scripture so he says read it slow yeah he said he says but they that wait upon and he said stop that's the only part I want you to see is but they that weighed upon ah [Music] I said a waiter my so then I look at it again and my perspective changes because so many times we're waiting for the Lord to do something and not realizing why we are so weak why we have no strength because what happens we're in the bench give me the word ministry give me the words and the Lord is trying to tell you that wait upon so check this out when you wait upon something it's to serve it's to ministers to someone that has personal needs so here you go you see who said the scripture again and you say Lord you say senor how am I going to renew my strength so many times the doctor will say okay in order for you to get strength you need to go on bed rest you need to relax just Netflix and chill for a while but God what God is telling you he's not telling you to just stay in the bench but what he's showing you is to wait upon so when you see your brother when you see him in need what can I do for you what can I do to wait upon you know there's something wonderful when you're at your lowest when you're at your weakest God wants you to serve D it's rough brother it's rough as the face seal says okay it is okay you have problems this is probably one of the one of the greatest things I've I've learned from Brother Calum is that you have problems I said yeah I have problems see go visit somebody baby but but I'm looking for counseling brother go visit somebody you have issues go visit somebody try and serve somebody for for a change we learned about that this morning feel like pastors pastors condemning me now but that's how you realize if you truly have the Holy Ghost it's how you react to correction right whoo but here's the problem sometimes we all want to be Eagles right that's our goal right the prophet says we're liking to Eagles but I've realized in life there's a lot of ostriches here it's a bird right it's a bird but I asked I asked my uh my family what's what's the difference between an oxygen and an eagle family right off the baton one can fly yeah that's exactly right you see the ostrich the ostrich has what it takes to fly oh my God it has one of the largest wingspans of any birds but it also has the largest body of any birds so so my thinking is well an eagle can fly an ostrich they weigh about 300 pounds or so uh Libras but why doesn't it want to fly it has the ability to but doesn't want to and I looked in the spiritual aspect of a straw of an ostrich if if for years you have listened to the message and you have been served so much what happens what you want to you want the pastor to do everything for you so after a while the wings that God has given you fly parabola now Aura they have no use the body that God has given you now has just become expandingo solamente what's that you become spiritually chunky you become spiritually obese because you've just eating and you're eating and year after year he says well I'm waiting on the Lord praise the Lord he's coming ah and what happens the wings don't work he said well I'm supposed to be an eagle wow brother you've been served too long you know it's time it's time Brothers with all the word that has been spoken all the word that has been consumed by us it's time to start serving brother sister hermana don't get complacent uh don't get relaxed and just because oh it's so good to to be a Christian I know I've accepted the message oh God is so good to me he's blessed me and we get relaxed we get complacents and then instead of eagles we start acting like ostriches oh my goodness [Music] brother Brandon says when God has called a person for a job to do there is no one that can take its place that's right amen yes there is no one that can take your place you are peculiar he says how often I have wondered how I would like to take oral Robert's Place how I would like to take Billy Graham's Place go speak to an audience of people call centers forget it and go home not have to stand there and wrestle again I cannot be Billy Graham Billy Graham but neither can Billy Graham be mean or we are both I cannot be Oral Roberts all the robbers cannot be mean Oral Roberts or robbers you're each one set in God's economy just for its place won fast all the time and communes with God while another one casts out devil because this one is fasting but it's the whole body of Christ working together imagine that for for a minute the body of Christ working together when we see these denominational barriers breaking us up and if I can bring that into our two hour time when we see these Malachi 4 5 barriers breaking us up we didn't have to look at the at the denominations anymore that's what hurts my heart because that's the thing that separates separates us there is no big people among us there's no great people among us we are all the same todos you know when we were in Uganda Uganda when you preach the matches when you preach a message like this that we are all the same it blows their mind because there are so many people that are looked down upon just because we're from America doesn't mean we're better just because we have the revelation of of who our of who our Prophet is that doesn't make us any better he says there is only one great Among Us you know there's no Fort Collins bride foreign [Music] how many are happy to be called The Bride Novia he says we must recognize him and if we seek honor is one from another we can't have faith because we are having faith in one another we got to have faith in Christ he is the one he is the one Among Us that we must have faith and then faith in what he is doing and has to give us now no one could take Moses's place no matter how much he ran wow brother Alex doesn't matter how much I ran because I want to tell you something again personally being behind a Pulpit I started was the last thing in my life that I ever wanted this was the last place I wanted to be care they asked me why you're going to be a preacher because your your grandpa was a preacher your dad is a preacher is your uncles are preachers your brothers are preachers and I said well that's fine I ain't gonna be a preacher no matter how much I ran I want to make this uh this uh this um this this paragraph here a little personal to me okay [Music] and you take it personal as well no matter how much Iran and no matter how much I tried to get away from it yet God knows what he is doing he knowed just what he had to take and make out of Williams these things had to happen no one could take William's place but just because no one could take my place does not give me the rights or the reason to feel that I am greater than anybody no brother the days of being in ostrich are over the days of putting your head in the sand because [Music] I'm going to read this last scripture here we're closing right now in the Book of Job 39 18. really quick here and this is why God wants us to be as Eagles Aguilas verse 12. 13 gave us thou the girly Wings unto the peacocks or wings and Feathers into the ostrich which leave with her eggs in the earth and warm with them in dust is and forget that the foot may crush them or that the wild beast may break them she is hardened against her young ones as though they were not hers her labor is in vain without fears because God has deprived her of wisdom neither hath he imparted to her understanding I'm gonna ask you to stand this morning yeah brother and sister hermano hermana if you feel siente at this time and that's the momento do an inventory of your life check to see what you need to get get rid of the things that you don't need we're not asking you to come to a church but we're asking you this morning to leave what you have and come to Christ it's the only way out of your situation the only way that you can never get peace in your life if you need peace in your life if you need a touch from the Lord the altar is open if you need something from the Lord cry out to him this morning I said Lord Do not pass me by either God said me do not pass me by Lord calling do not pass me byor and pass me not oh Jen gentle say Avion [Music] here my home [Music] and why oh no others out are called bless my brother this morning Father in the name of Jesus that you would touch him foreign [Music] [Music] thank you Hallelujah [Music] because [Applause] foreign

[Applause] [Music] impact but instead of life [Music] maybe you you may feel like you have received the the results you want salary results the desired results but he is here he is here to test himself in your life to prove himself to prove himself in your life God is here to prove himself he wants you to know him he wants you to know what to use he wants you to know what type of God you have he doesn't want you to hear from someone else he wants you to know what type of God you have usted you can call God to the scene you could call God to the scene you can create it inside of yourself the true atmosphere to cause God to come to your life but you have to create it you have to produce the true atmosphere in your heart I am here the neces [Music] that I don't desire [Music] but I cannot do it without your help is there someone here that can say I cannot do it without your help Lord are you the man help me to burn everything that's in in vividas bothering me in my life but you have to believe it and so I can see you in me you have a desire from God if we can't see it is if we don't see the desired results do something what do I need to do you see their result in my life he has not changed he is demonstrate himself to you [Music] [Music] in me while we worship Him the president of God is here the Ministers of God are here it is just up to you to want it and he will do it in your life amen amen [Music] [Music] blue blue [Music] [Applause] [Music] years [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] distance [Music] [Music] yesterday we gathered with my family at my house [Music] with my uncles [Music] cancer to one of my uncles he was attacked by cancer to the another one he was also attacked by cancer another one was what was attacked by diabetes and he is blind ICA and as we're talking with the family [Music] allows certain things to happen what the prophet says when we're on our weakest right there in our weakness that's where God manifests himself when you have your needs when you truly need God in your life when you're in desperation God is going to take you to that place so you cry out so you cry out but why you win for a cancer to come a sickness to come that wants to kill you why you could cry in afraid with your old heart where God has given you out can we just worship him he cannot speak glory to God but you have your voice God has allowed you that you can see but you're more dead [Music] they know someone that's sick okay because the spiritual death and it gives me sadness and he will respond to you yes and I will still cry out to my Lord Hallelujah foreign [Music] [Music] Canada is [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] yes Lord this is [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music]

[Music] we're waiting for the song leader to say something to do something waiting for the preachers give glory to God but a good waiter he deserves it wait upon the Lord significa means to be a good servant significant To Be watchful what else does my Lord need what else does my savior need what does he want from me that's how we should be waiting upon the Lord does it mean not doing anything no waiting upon the Lord means that you're watching okay what does he desire of me when he knocks at the door of my heart what does he want me to do I'm here to the answer to your call no have you ever seen those bad Waiters that you try to wave them down they're over there talking with their co-workers they don't even realize when somebody is needing them I believe that's how God is calling and calling and calling speaks and he speaks and speaks to us and we just ignore them but those that wait upon the Lord those that are already in willing to serve him to do something for him okay although it would be the dorm out of the church but to do something for him they shall receive new Strength she'll lift up their wings like eagles oh that's what I want to be okay he says the word to my heart you know the more I walk in the ways of God the more sensitive I am to his voice I don't want him to yell at me I want to hear his thoughts and his desires they don't get excited when they hear the voice of God they've heard it so much perhaps perhaps they've heard it so much they don't get excited they want him to do spoken about greatly spoken of great Revelations to be spoken so that they could get excited so that they would answer but I don't want to be that way I wonder even if he speaks the most simple things even if he just speaks of Amazing Grace that my heart would answer to his voice [Music] I'm the one that was lost and it's only by his grace I want to get excited look Brothers I want to get excited with just knowing that his presence is in this place I don't want to be
