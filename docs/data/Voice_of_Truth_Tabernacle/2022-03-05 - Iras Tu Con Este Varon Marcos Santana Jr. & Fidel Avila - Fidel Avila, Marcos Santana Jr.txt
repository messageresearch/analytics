[Music] god bless you all this evening uh it's a honor and pleasure to be with you all once again here in fort collins uh caught a little bit by surprise tomorrow but uh i was once told a long time we would always be ready to to know that i was going to be able to see your faces once again and i want to thank rotito for the opportunity to speak to you all this evening uh and uh we're just passing by on our way to nebraska portfolios asia nebraska and you know me and brother michael were talking yo el hermano my costa lando how can we stop by colorado not visit our brothers from fort collins accompany me is our brother michael rodriguez hermano michael rodriguez uh his wife's sister briana rodriguez sister biryanda rodriguez and their three beautiful children jesus uh michael jose uh michael josue matthew jeremiah jeremy has michael and the newest blessing to their family the miracle baby for the family little ruth joy his precious daughter ruth joyce we i want to send you greetings from our pastor back home in phoenix in phoenix he sends greetings to everyone and likewise my father he sends his greetings along with my mother my father my mother i don't want to take too much time i know and uh even though i think the youth should be able to last longer than the older folks [Music] but i know how it is i i'd like to still consider myself since i have you standing can you please turn your bibles to genesis chapter 24. and to my understanding uh what what uh the focus for this evening was going to be on rebecca in rebecca and that the youth have been preaching lately on the characters of the bible so we don't want to come and break that continuity that you have established already so we want to start in genesis 24 verse 57 when you have it if you can say amen 57 reads and they said we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth and in other words we're going to bring the young lady and we're going to ask her the question without influencing her seeing influence without pressuring her tim but to put the decision for the rest of her life in her own hands and they called rebecca and said unto her we'll thou go with this man and she said i will go rebecca so to give this a title we thank you so much for another opportunity to be in your house lord gracias foreign to be worshipping here with like believers of the faith father that that love you so much lord that can serve you every day of their life and young people that make the effort to be at a youth service some of which don't even need to be told to come and we put everything in your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated i'm going to just read 58 one more time well and they called rebecca and said unto her wilt i'll go with this man go ahead bro yeah pregnant so we should all know that rebecca is a type of the bride and i know that here this evening this is the voice of truth tabernacles and and i know this here is the bride and tonight i'm going to call you all rebecca rebecca i hope that you're identifying with rebecca espero and we know that the messenger was our prophet william branham william mary and branham and the message was to look for a bride for his master rebecca's here tonight uh will we go with this man hombre will we go with this man and rebecca said that i will go si i will go with that message that we're going to speak to you this evening there are like types of messengers this evening messengers that do not bring their messages messengers that do not bring messengers that do not bring their orders but they bring a message from the king del rey they mean a message from the lord and they're bringing that word unto the rebecca la rebecca unto the bride that we have this evening so now going to the message brother branham says he says what if a woman won't come with me elijah like it says in the bible when he's asking well what if the woman the bride doesn't want to come with me it was a very valid question because like we said the option is yours young sisters you said the young man the option is yours so rebecca could have said no so rebecca but i believe he was a little more wise than that he was he was told brother says he said then you're free of this oath so in other words he knew that she wouldn't say no yes because the angel of the lord was going to be with him and that holy spirit that was with him that holy spirit that was with our prophet and he met the beautiful rebecca they're getting in consecration to come bring a message it's just like right here he says how he begins praying he's waiting for the leadership of the angel of the lord because he's about to meet these beautiful rebeccas that brother branham's talking about that are going to one day be the bride of jesus christ you've got the potential today so like we said the minister's only here to deliver a message just to invite you into the lord jesus christ invite you to be a bride to the lord jesus christ of christ that's what i'm here for brother says and what was our brother branham he was our prophet he was the messenger he was the angel all these titles all these gifts and amen to every single one of those but at least to me but i believe greater than all those things [Music] here to a leader to serve the duty he was set forth and that was just to send a message there's a king seeking a bribe there's a lord seeking a wife and he's only looking for one kind of bribe for virtuous rebecca's to take as his queen una rebekah and the gift of serving it comes in many different ways you know as we were taking that long 15-hour drive over here [Music] we were talking a little bit about serving and the gift of serving and yes it comes in very different forms different formas was just telling us that he's got amazing ministers that come and speak to you all week in and week out okay ministers but this is only a part of the work up here he said i depend more upon what they do off the pulpit than on the public was sent with the ministry to serve and deliver messages and he fulfilled and rebecca too had a ministry of surveys her her serving is when she came and she gave water to those camels my brother was telling me in the back how much water each camel depended upon cameo you know we're joking in the back thinking wow this rebecca must have been a pretty strong woman i don't know if she had big muscles or she carried it on her head one way or another that gift of serving gave her the strength to do what she was sent to do una forma not just that she was sent to feed a laser the messenger so how is that messenger in her home so i found and you don't need an invitation to get to that wedding because you are the bride you slandov you're the one that's getting married to that king brother branham says he said once again go get that bride that's the duty 1962-1962 july 8th julio ocho brother branham says and quickly as soon as she heard about isaac in cuando escucho de isak before she had ever saw him antes she said hey adijo can you guess what she said i will go yo like we read in the scriptures i will go all you had to do was believe in jesus rebecca didn't have to see those features rebecca didn't have to hear that masculine voice that was good she didn't have to see that big body noise but she just accepted the message that was given to him and she put into effect this tiny little thing that each and every one of us should have es which is faith she put her faith in that messenger she put her faith in that message see that was abraham's brother's child showing that the church in the last days will be blood relation to jesus christ that's talking about us tonight that's why we turn our hair to see where's it coming from because we are predestinating when we as sheep we hear the pastor's voice and it's now that his blood flows through my veins that blood made me his kindred essa miso his kindred miso that blood may be a part of his dna so when the laser he was told specifically not to go out into the world go to the canaanites the the sodomites and whatever was out at that time he was told no no no you go to my people [Music] our prophet was sent unto the churches to bring out a bride for himself and he said rebecca come out bridegroom awaits you but continues and rebecca is rebecca as soon as she heard of isaac she there was something in her that pulled her straight to him and though she hadn't seen him or nothing she yet wanted to go by her own choice away from her mother and away from her brother is your mother have you forsaken your mother and father tonight as they say to put on the name of our lord jesus christ tonight like i said i hope i'm talking to rebecca's this evening because this is a youth servant and i know the young people you know they're gonna understand me i know a lot of you have social media and we get caught on it from time to time and i've heard so much that term don't be a karen and i see a couple of smiles right now we don't got to be too religious this evening is complaining karen's question uh uh these i want my rights karen okay these racist karen's currents no young people no homeless what jesus christ is looking for tonight lo que estas he's looking for humble rebecca now isaac was a type of christian and through isaac come christ and then rebecca was the type of the church did you notice the bride nota la novia maybe there's some rebeccas that are going to get found tonight the sign it was in the evening time when rebecca came out and was led by the holy spirit do you believe that you young people came here tonight to hear that call of the holy spirit brother branham says that's the reason why i think today that that the born again and that's why they act so peculiar to people yes they've made their decisions brother branham says they're going to go out and go out regardless if the rest of them don't go out independent they're going anyhow no important and i like that for prayer lord we place these young people in your hands thank you lord for that prophet messenger and continue to give us more of this message every day of our life [Music] we want more and more of your holy spirit and we ask of it each and every day more and more we give you all the honor and the glory gloria in the name of the lord jesus christ jesus amen amen [Applause] [Music] cuatro how many came to have [Music] is tonight is amen from being able to make that decision this is a question this is the question will you go with this man this is a question [Music] i like what our pastor told us about two fridays ago this is i like what the pastor said he says is you know the devil makes us think many times that we have we still have time to settle with the lord in other words the devil plays with our minds he plays with you and i say he tells how many how many uh children are dying of the war and today is a day to make that decision you haven't accepted the lord jesus christ in your heart is we still have time to settle with the lord he makes us think that things are going to remain the same that is the devil's strategy stink brothers that everything's going to be okay we're going to be okay but let me tell you tonight today is and how this [Music] [Music] i remember that i was very young there are there are characters there's abraham the father isaac the son rebekah rebecca the bride eliza the servant hermano and laban and one thing that catches my attention isn't abraham's decision abraham had to take how to make it he he he realized that his son needed a bride and or it says in verse two it says and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had yes so he sent eliza and this is a number one point like this and the servant took ten camels of of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and they already explained to us of the of the gifts these guests brothers amongst these gifts when is the will of god and the most tremendous thing was how they felt when says and he said oh lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and shoot kindness unto me and to my master abraham and there was a servant and he began to pray and he began to pray and i heard these people and the wind begins to blow it i know the judah scripture yeah and the wind blows because god vindicates i believe that there's examples here bracelets on rebecca is these characters uh what is uh the mother of rebecca and laban it says that the mother typifies a church they were they were uh putting a a snare taker and in parentheses maybe maybe levin wanted a little bit more money so then with us a few days at least at least 10 after that she shall go that's what the devil does he tells you wait that's woven you're young it's pretty much he's pretty much telling him let's tell him to wait a little bit but rebecca brothers yes she was waiting brother she had already spoken with eliezer yeah [Music] and she already knew who her isaac was and and look at this brother nada and there's nothing [Music] and day after day we reject him rebecca rebecca rebecca rebecca she's simply by what she heard from elijah because she knows oh to tell you i stopped to suck there's your isaac and this is how she was she that's how she was yes and he said don't don't keep me here [Music] because we're so to play and if the rapture happens today i'm thinking about going to go get a coffee or going to the outside to go talk with a brother or sister don't misunderstand me it's fine but this is more important i haven't regretted don't think that there's more time [Applause] and that's the question brothers [Music] and this is where rebecca looked up or lifted her up her eyes [Music] there is nothing that can take the place of the lord jesus christ no no no no no nothing amen [Music] unto the servant what man is it that walketh in the field to meet us now i ask myself if he's already on his way [Music] it is my master [Music] there's nothing else that's worth it please stand thank you lord forgive me but he is just waiting for you to accept him don't don't miss out on that wedding on that let's pray heavenly father lord to make my decision [Applause] amen amen [Music] he [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] from [Music]
