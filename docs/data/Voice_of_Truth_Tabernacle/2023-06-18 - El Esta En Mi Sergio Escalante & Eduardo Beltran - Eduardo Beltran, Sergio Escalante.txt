I'm almost forgetting it but my wife reminded me yeah [Music] the moment came when God revealed to me what was happening I was struggling a lot with work it was a 2008 forgiveness uh [Music] face to face it was something very odd pero is if God was speaking to it to me I was speaking I was speaking to myself yes and the person I saw before me was I was mocking me is the um it was as if it was it was looking at me like like in a despiteful way but at the same time kind of mocking me I remember seeing him so I was between us asleep and awake yes and I felt like I was being bullied something within me foreign and I said you know what is I'm a son of God and you know very well I said I don't care uh how much you make me or fall into the mud I know I'm a son of God [Music] and I will reign with him in eternity and for many time that troubled me for a long time that troubled me but at the same time he gave me strength because I said yes I am the Son of God I began to surrender more and more to God and began to do what I could to help a church we built a church I was always there I was doing it for God and I got into the habit of listening to tapes and I had tapes all the time in my on my headphones that was giving me a lot of spiritual strength and I felt unworthy yes I felt that like a man with many flaws but I also knew that God saw me as a finished product resume and I knew that God was working through me and God continue to help me so I thought strong but the Bible says they think in terms of strong beware that he not fall is you begin to relax as the brother said this morning and then you think you have it made you think you can overcome anything you feel like you're invincible and the devil has many years but uh he's had many years of experience to know how to trap you and all he's waiting for is for that time you begin to get careless and when you least expect it you'll be on the ground yes the devil will be mocking yeah that's the truth Brothers for example I I see my home and I see it it's it still needs a lot of work but it's not the same as when we began [Music] you can see a lot of work has been done sometimes I see myself uh and I I began to get depressed because I see it I like a lot of things when you get the mirror of the word you begin to uh see yourself and see all your imperfections and see all the things that you're lacking the devil tells you uh so much time and you continue to struggle with it but if you look the house isn't the same man yes my wife and I have we were just had 25 years of marriage when we had to 25 years we are remarried is my wife's friend said I said you're going to marry the same man he said no he's not the same Glory right [Applause] yes and that is only the grace of God [Music] and the mercy of God okay that's been working in our lives yeah this is I feel like we need to surrender a little bit more but I can recognize there's not a there's not a better thing than to serve God there's not another person that can help us only God so I thank God for my wife [Music] because uh you may not believe it but she has helped me very much I believe that if it wasn't for her then I wouldn't be here I would have threw in the towel mini a long time ago yeah yes she's one of the ones that God always answers her prayers if we have a home it's because she asked God foreign I couldn't eat and I uh I went into the bathroom to uh to spit out some phlegms and when I made the effort to to cough I fainted the next thing I heard was just a loud cracking crash and I was on the ground I was just there a confused days and my wife came and she said what happened I said I don't know help me help me get up and I I told her I got up and I said I told her take me to the emergency room I told her I think I broke my leg we went to the hospital they took an x-ray from my chest and from my knee they said you have nothing we're going to give you we're going to give you a bomb there and send some pills for the pain yeah I was working with a client it's actually a doctor and I told him that I hurt my knee I told him the story he asked me if I wanted an MRI I said that that'd be fine he made the appointment at the hospital and I went in and when they sent him the results he told me sorry but your knee is very very dangerous from the front and from the inside and are the ones on the side [Music] you're gonna have to get operated on yeah I told them well if I needed he said don't worry I know the best surgeons in Phoenix so that it won't be so expensive that moment begins in Texas and one of them he charged I thought it would be more results [Music] it was 3 000 plus anesthesia plus the place the operating room yeah it ended up actually being 14. [Music] looking about six months you're barely going to be able to support your knees uh he told me I hope you're ready for about a year where you don't work I told my wife okay she said what without working no come on let's pray for you Europe for me and she prayed for me and in less than a week I was working in less than a month I didn't even have the knee brace on anymore and I went with the clients and he said what are you doing I I said he says you don't have your knee brace hurts and I told them it didn't hurt he said that's not possible we want to know what you and then they they asked me for the physical therapist information but in our reality it was the prayer of my wife she just didn't want me I said she didn't want me there just being late she didn't want me to just be there at home but here recently there was another virus going around that affected and it was draining my energy one day I was working and I I wasn't able I went home and just there I fell on the bed and that's how my wife found me just laying there in the bed she said what happened I I told her I don't know I just was just very tired okay she said oh that's fine and the next day was the same I went to work and I felt very very tired and I went back home yeah and just as I fell there in the bed that's how my wife would find me he said no that's not right I'm gonna pray for you assistant [Music] so sometimes you get accustomed or used to the things and it becomes so normal but the Miracles go over our head and we don't no longer see them sometimes God pinches our conscience and we realize that God is with us another trial like that is he is here with us he's been here at home for uh for a time now and God had to bring him with a broken leg but God brought him yes and it's due to the prayers of my wife but um the situation my family was going to with with uh it was one of the things that the devil was using to attack me [Music] I couldn't speak about that with anyone yes I heard somebody I was someone talking when I was Thomas one time we were at a restaurant and they were telling my wife you know I saw your son and it hurt me to see him yes I could not hear that get up and leave because I would begin to cry and the devil was just hitting me there yeah but then God comes and he reminds us of the promises [Music] to know that that it's all worth it and to be on alert foreign we get lost if I'm lost I'm lost and it's a very sad thing to think that way but we know that it's only the process that we're going through and when we feel the most lonely we're just simply listening to a tape you can hear the you can feel the injection of the strength yes you can feel as though that somebody has given you oxygen yeah and then you want to begin to fight and then and the best defense is is the attack when you feel attacked just stay there you just like do nothing you have to swing back you have to hit the devil and the best way to hit him is to say I'm a Son of God by the blood of the Lord the Lord Jesus Christ is working in my life come forward thank you 've been together thank you God bless brother Sergio always good to hear that what God does God works different with everyone and we all struggle somewhere there is not one person that doesn't struggle momento but the time comes when we say where is where is it with what I struggle it's only like a memory porque de La promoted because he has promised to help us and he helps us even ourselves helping ourselves it's him and us I'll be reading Colossians from verse 24 to verse 29. the reason I'll be reading that Focus only on 27 is because it has a semi-colon and colon and then a period till 27. so God is trying to tell us something here Colossians 1 24 says carne locaff Iglesia who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church a La palabradios whereof I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God edades even the mystery which had been hit from ages and from Generations but now is made manifest to his Saints Mysterio

the subject he is in me he is in me and this is that God's gonna speak I saw it foreign I know it's a prophet speaks of God's triple purpose and God's first purpose was to reveal himself to man is to express himself the prophet says when God was alone what a thing this takes us before there was an atom before it was a star before there was a tree before anything existence of the world the back of his mind when he was alone it is I believe in my opinion that the first thing was Angels now he had something to worship but nothing else existed did not know that why are you so afraid of the devil s yes he can come and tell you all the things other than the things when God formed you you can't come and torment me with anything God had a purpose or nuestro primero Padres when he plays our first Father's Adam and Eve now he has someone to worship him here again someone who he could manifest that's what the prophet is the ministry of God revealed ah but they had to fall did you know they had to fall they had to fall in the back of his mind when they fell is so he already knew that that was inside him tanto why are you so sad this is the prophet says God gradually begins so bring forth his purpose Moises typed everything in the Lord Jesus it was a mystery yeah Jose Joseph go and see and see Jesus because he is there that's right we cannot understand the creature that lives we had to become one of us that's why he presented himself it could [Music] I Rejoice with this I see him you know I weep alone but of joy [Music] everything here's hears for me now he was displayed but he had it in secret he came to his own what did you come to albino he came to his own to die to redeem us the day of Pentecost he came and what he is he is so great brethren you know I see him everywhere I
