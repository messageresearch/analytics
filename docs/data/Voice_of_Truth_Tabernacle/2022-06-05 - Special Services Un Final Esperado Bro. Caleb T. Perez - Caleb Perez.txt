[Applause] of you as i said those that have come from different places god bless you as we start this message we we also want to greet those that are online a beggar came and sat [Music] and i began to tell him of all the types of bread that there were yeah i told him everything i knew about bread i spoke of flour and wheat grain and but i looked up and i was surprised that he was not smiling i just want bread how wise for the saviors i applaud his choice follow me and i'll show you our bakery took him down the hall guided him with a different room is i knew he was moved as we stepped into this auditorium full of stained glass windows the beggar did not and i read them the recipe from the cookbook of life by now the beggar had taken a seat on the front row i knew what he wanted he wanted to hear me speak so i asked him would you like to hear me speak here he said no no i just want friends oh why so far i replied because savior is and get him to the front door of the bakery what i have to say next is very important i told him as we stood outside i know one who adds two spoons of salt rather than one of those i know another whose oven is three degrees too hot they call it bread looked back at me and shrugged his shoulders and said i guess i just lost my appetite i shook my head and returned to my office the world is just desiring a piece of paper i believe this morning if you've come with the right attitude i believe you'll take and you'll receive the bread of the lord you will and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be that is when one stone shall not be left upon another and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world is [Music] amen may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated many times it is a word that brings a lot of fear into people the bible is full of phrases that talks about the [Music] and each one of those phrases deals with time so very fearful now i don't know how many of i can if i can see your hands the more the moment we see pandemic churches began to be false people are fearful and that's one of the things that we find out through those wholes we do not have the knowledge the wisdom of what these words really mean pray that this really helps you into your soul we are not afraid anymore which simply is the fear of the end of the world anybody here have doomsday photos we want to go as a sunday school this morning how many of you how many of you have doomsday phobias and if you hear the end of the world oh my god your palms get sweaty maybe your neck [Music] oh you get a little nervous is anybody here you watch you watch too much cnn and what happens oh you start to go crazy you become like a neurotic my goodness we're at the end but let me tell you without understanding without knowledge it will destroy us yes sir yes yoshi hosea 4 6 says this jose cuatro says my people are destroyed because of world war ii my people are destroyed no no it doesn't say that nobody says it says my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge without knowledge of what is happening for what is going to happen it gets us to feeling a certain way paranoid depressed and everything else but i'm here to tell you that's the only way for us not to be fearful [Music] that right i mean there's a lot of people out there there's a lot of preachers which is a [Music] and that's in verse 14. and it simply says this this is implementation and the gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness now i have to get this and make sure that you understand me where i'm going with it okay so and what's the sign of the coming and of the end of the world those are two different words but it talks about the end of the world the greek word is soon but when it talks about the end the greek word is telos ah now you have to take this and because to know where i'm going when the gospel of the kingdom is preached in all the worlds [Music] but these words are jesus speaking i you go on and he says i am the first why are i want you to catch that you're okay captain is because to see jesus christ in everything in spanish brother henry help us out in espanol he says i am alpha you say yo omega ah we are creatures of time and we are finite in our minds and we cannot process the infinite process we cannot process the he's and it is not so much a period of i gotta let that one just sink we always think of it oh my gosh the end of the world disaster it's the end of all things not to the believer nope she's not fearful of this she's not fearful of that word watch as this unfolds this morning notice what the bible says he that endureth unto the end it doesn't say he that endures to the end of the world it says he that endureth unto thee then let's follow that for a moment because the scripture does not lie what it's talking about he that endureth unto the goal he that [Music] until the fulfillment of we don't have an end church listen to me we don't have an egg i'm just gonna see what happens at the end come on you know the the greatest spirit that there is in a church the greatest bad spirit i should say in the church in legalism can somebody tell me what it is that should be the spirit that should be cast out you know why because in every church you get a little bit of a religious spirit the spiritual relationship i've been in the message a religious spirit will tell you that you're okay but when the power of almighty god is come on church well i go to church every sunday and the devil beats you every sunday domingo what does that mean yes significance come on now we want [Applause] it is how many of you believe you haven't expected we got to make sure then by the end of the service that you know what your end is ah we're amongst believers praise god what is will come [Applause] [Applause] i want you to get this because this is important once again they asked about the end of the world but he answers them by pointing them to the end in other words what shall be the sign of thy coming no that's the seventh still oh you want to know what will be the sign of my coming he's telling you when the full perfect complete word bender it is what we are striving how many know that god that god he he wants the best for you tell your neighbor and his strategy is to fulfill his plan i want to know how many of you are in his plan in the message perfect faith by perfect weakness and i want to know how many empty vessels are here when's the last time you shook the world a religious spirit you says you're doing okay yeah you preach i want to know if it's anybody here it taken them 10 days to get all emptied out and the religious spirit in the church says you don't need to do that you don't need to fast get yourself ready starting you're okay lesbian you'll be fine until the coming of the lord oh yeah and you're like yes i believe i'm okay oh we begin okay stand in church sometimes you know negligence i mean i i watch we stand in church they're praying i've already heard all that i already [Music] and that religious spirit can blow both ways oh but when the word of god comes forward and says will thou be made whole completely i did what i did to a harlot with rehab whole then that by giving themselves completely over to christ they knew what their end would be i find people struggling with that so much i don't know what my end is going to be wait wait a minute in the gospel of saint thompson he says he said the disciples come and say vienna disciples master maestro have you found the beginning he said in the place of the beginning of the principle is the place of the end i don't know if you got that enough i'm going to say it again this is the beginning of the place of the year come on now it's time to not play church anymore you got to get ready we got to get it [Applause] revival fires like but they are baptizing hundreds now we actually believe what we a religious spirit will say oh thank you preach good today hogwash after giving breakfast and he's doing wonderful things in ours come on tell your neighbors why don't you start by shaking your own little world hello everybody you get in by grace a man shows up to the gates of heaven i want to go in what do i have to do well good job [Music] is [Applause] [Applause] jeremiah 29 11 says or i know the thoughts that i think toward you i don't know if jesus loves me jesus wow i'm gonna say again i know the thoughts that i have towards me and not of evil you and i in the spirit and not of affliction you know the affliction calamity misery or trouble problems to give you a future a reward that i longed for you okay we're not playing churches we have an expected end god has a plan that we must follow to give you an expected end and that plan was laid out in six seals it is called the plan of redemption then what was the seventh seal our expectations and if he will reveal to you this morning by revelation for revelation that this is the end of your suffering i'm here suffering for something let me see your hands that doesn't matter what it is look at the hands that have gone up this is brother brad i'm speaking on adoption he'll reveal to you that this is the end of your suffering nobody has to put your hand their hands on you right now somebody can receive that today it's according to your face that this is the end of my suffering he says this is the end of your sickness there's a sister here that has blood clots in her lungs

him that's not brother caleb [Applause] come on anyone else can stand up and say this yeah my suffering and feminine music the end of your sickness this is not to say you're never going to have a problem what you have been dealing with today the answer is there is an expectation this word says and give your testimonies [Applause] what kind of people should we be a people that know um habakkuk 2 verse 2 and 3 says this and the lord answered me and said write the vision playing upon tables is i'm going to make this declaration i've made this before declaration look at your life right now

is not what you saw oh what you see temporary found himself in prison peru because as did you see the way he treated me is my time is almost out i gotta go just a little bit more that's what satan is trying to do keep the vision from speaking oh oh i'm gonna say it again that's what satan's trying to do he doesn't want his vision to speak that's why it's a full-on attack today of our freedom of speech yes sir yes attack oh freedom of speech for everyone as long as you're on their agenda when you speak against what they have going on now you're a bigot you're a racist what's going on satan to

don't want to leave you hanging that's the thunder against the enemies consecrated [Music] oh my then as soon as the holy ghost was given for as soon as he gets his church in speaking condition well if the pastor says it then that's what it is okay that's okay but when are you going to speak through love and persuade yeah um fellowship then there will come an eden and those has been drawn again that's our expected experience but i to get into speaking conditions we are the last names and all it's waiting for is for the last name to be manifest when you fulfill it through your life that is
