you would Inspire them bless your people Lord Jesus bless your servants Lord bless the Ley Lord Jesus in Jesus name amen amen if you have your bible let us let us get into the word and in 1 Samuel chapter 1 verse 11 and the word of God God reads this way and she vowed a vow and said oh lord of hosts if thou Willl look indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thy forget thine handmade but will give unto thy handmade a man child and then I will give unto him the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word and you may be seated very fine job to the musicians and the song leader so many familiar faces that I that I see and it brings a lot of good memories it is a privilege to be here tonight I want to thank brother Tito for the confidence my pastor for the confidence amen amen so the story we took the scripture from is a story that you may have heard before and it talks of this woman her name was Hannah see Hannah had a husband and her husband had another wife and that wife had many children and every year they would go to the house of the Lord and they would go to the priest Eli and they would Worship the Lord but Hannah desired a [Music] son there was a desire placed in her heart that not the desire I believe was placed there by God and year after year the husband would give them portions to give unto the Lord but Hannah want wanted something a little bit more she wanted to f f fulfill her motherly duties she wanted to train a child in the ways of the Lord she wanted to dedicate something she wanted a vow a vow because Hannah had got so desperate in the things of this thing that it just tore her up she was just crying to the Lord one day H have you ever done anything like that maybe there's something that you see your brother receiving and maybe year after year you could say okay that's fine but then it's like when is it my [Music] turn am I talking to any of the youth today is there something that you desire of the Lord maybe it's not a son but there's something groaning inside of you something that something that you want to birth out and we'll get into that you know she couldn't have the children but she made a vow to the Lord she said Lord if you give me a son I will return it back to you kind of a little hard sometimes right Lord if you give me a new Xbox I might start clapping my hands in church Lord I need a new car so I can go to the game but no she wanted to give something to the Lord Lord if you give something to me in my heart the desire is right sometimes we have the wrong desire but Lord look at my heart look at the desire in my heart cuz as soon as you give it to [Music] me I want to give it back to you I will give unto you all the days of his life and no razor should should come upon his head wow what what future that this child had right in one sense he didn't have a choice one sense but his mama brought him to church when he was old enough brought him to the feet of Eli and said you know my my my petition you know what the Lord did for me I'm bringing my I'm dedicating my son to the Lord and this is wasn't something that they brought him to church one day and then she left with him to their home no she left him at church who is this boy does anybody know who this this boy is this is Samuel we're talking about right a prophet of the Lord not just anybody when she vowed a vow to have a razor not touch his head she was fulfilling the guidelines of a Nazarite vow you might be familiar with that right the Nazarite they weren't able to they were guided to not drink any strong drink they were told that they must wear their hair long and don't go to any near dead bodies they were told to be separated separated the Israelites the special ones would do this for a purpose to consecrate themselves to the Lord but they wanted not just to separate from their brothers per se it was a special purpose to not just separate from my brother here it was to say to the Lord I hear your commandment I am separating myself unto you Lord and the Israelites that would see these brothers that would take this vow it was very obvious to them who was doing it I see the ladies they wear the long hair and the long dress many times it's so easy to see them you go to the store you see a lady with long hair and a dress you think why I think there's a bunch there's some Believers around here somewhere are you a Christian oh okay yeah yeah everybody knows this the world knows this cuz you look a little different even the devil knows this and he likes to look hold on guys come on demon friends I want you to keep an eye on these ones right here they look a little different for the guys sometimes it's not very easy to see because we don't all have long hair right it's not talking so much about your long hair phally more of spiritually what did the angel tell brother branam don't ever drink or smoke or defile your body in any way because there's a purpose for you when you get older while you say now that's just for the Prophet this is the New Age The Prophet's been gone for a little while kind not really his physical body yes but not his message his message is alive to today and doing very well and doing very well but I say unto you today is there any young man who has been offered a drink by the world and said come on try it you might like it has that ever happened to you any young men any young lady why it happens to me about every week at at work dealing with the world and they would say hey come on you got to come out with us you got to come out to drink with us and I say well why don't you come to church with me well the the walls might find fall down brother the walls might fall down brother that's the way the world thinks right they're a little scared well maybe if I fellowship with you I ain't going to drink well why do you not drink Seth I am a Christian too I'm just like you come on with me a little drink won't hurt a little drink won't hurt let's just have a good time no no no no I will not do that no finally they started to respect me a little bit because one of them says man you have church again this weekend why are you taking off a church or taking off from work cuz we're going to go do a work of the Lord cuz I want to be there with my brothers and sisters when they said let us go into the house a Voice of Truth Tabernacle Voice of Truth Tabernacle we're going to dedicate a building here doesn't it thrill your soul for all the hard work that you put in Church looks beautiful but even so I see a lot of work that you've been putting in the members that this ministry has been putting in the people of God here that the young people have been feeding Friday night I see you and I want to say Well done you should give yourself an Applause I'm a p I'm privileged to be able to work with the young people in Las Cruses a privilege and I'll smile because sometimes they look at me and say hey are you happy to be here sth but I want to let you know I'm very happy nothing more that I want to do in this world because of the great parents that I had that they're sitting right here today if you would see me I don't try to Puff myself up but my parents have had a great hand in the way I was grown up in the way that I was trained because they love the Lord with all their heart they're very Godly Parents and sometimes when I don't do something right they're not afraid to take me to God's [Music] word and gave me a spanking I used to get spanking a lot when I was a child and as I look back on my life I deserved each one but I'm thankful for the parents because they brought me to church and that my father would say as long as you live in my house we're going to church as long as you live in my house we're going to praise the Lord even when he don't want to and how dare I say Dad I'm tired of going to church because you know what would happen and this wouldn't mean much much to me until I would get a little older you see the prophet samel the more time he spent in church at the temple they might have dropped him off when he was about four years old the Bible says as soon as she weaned him off would you drop your child off but I was brought here to church and I would sit in the back and I always would see my father singing at the pulpit and the Lord would just move when he would sing the Lord still does and I would sit down and sometimes I would say Lord I want that maybe I'm a bad kid at home I don't know everything but something I want to sing to you Lord and I just had my grandfather would always tell me when you would sing open your heart to the Lord so you grow older Samuel will grow older and he would Minister but yet the word of the Lord didn't come to him yet until finally he would hear something saying Samuel Samuel Samuel Samuel Samuel do you remember remember when the Lord has called you do you remember how it felt do you remember how I felt and I was just like Samuel I felt I I I could have align with this story and Samuel would go to Eli you here I am Eli you called for me right well it wasn't me no Samuel Samuel here I am Eli what do you need of me that wasn't me Samuel go back to your room Samuel Samuel Samu Sam here I am Eli well that wasn't me go back to your room and on that third try he he finally figured out what was going on and he said go go back to your room and let us read that and the Lord came and stood 1 Samuel 3:10 and called at other times Samuel Samuel and as Eli's instructions he said speak for thy servant heareth you see he must remembered what his mama did but now it comes to a point in our lives as young people your parents can bring you to church kicking and screaming and maybe you don't want it but I urge you to not open your heart to the Lord why do these people I would always ask why does my father my grandfather my Theos why do they work so hard for the Lord without complaint I never heard them complain I got to go help God's children even if it was during the night because they open themselves to the Lord they were brought up right they dedicated themselves to the Lord they were separated from the world because their purpose was not to act like the world and your purpose tonight young people no matter how much you kick and complain you g the you gripe and moan when they say we're going to go have service Friday night in Las Cruses they didn't complain cuz they made up their mind and let us go as another one in the Bible who took this vow you heard about a man named Samson you heard about him and how his parents they presented him to the Lord with a Nazarite vow don't let the razor come upon your head let it happen don't drink the strong drink we need you Samson we need you Samson because there's a purpose for you when you get older well maybe Samson would say as a youth why does have to be my job I don't want to do it let somebody else let somebody else's problem I want to do something else I want to fulfill my own desires and as the Lord would come upon him because he had the Nazarite vow he would just go and Bully the Philistines all around the gift he had inside of him was to tear down the Philistines there was no King that in that day only judges and the Lord raised him up put the desire on his parents' heart and Sansum grew he grew and he did what the Lord commanded but only just because he commanded it wasn't something in his heart that he did it from Just because of the pressure of the parents maybe we serve the Lord not because we want to but because maybe my daddy is a minister in this church my daddy is a pastor I had to do it or I'll get in trouble and Samson wanted to go to the world that was his desire right and who did he go to when he go to the world the world has opened up arms for youve been waiting for you come on Samson and a pretty girl appeared to him has a pretty girl appeared to you a pretty boy and the world would love Samson and Samson loved to flirt with the world in a drop of a hat he would said Lord he commissioned me for a purpose and they would say Samson the Philistines are beating beating the Israelites up all right give me a second and he would take care of it but it wasn't truly what was in his heart yet yet until the that woman Delight she wanted to know something about Samson because the world's tired of the ministry beating up the devil they're just a little tired and so let's send someone that could maybe break down Samson's defenses you know Satan wants to break your defenses when you make a stand for the Lord he's trying to entice you he wants your heart Satan does he wants that I see how hard he's working for the Lord I want him to work for me I can promise him anything so Delilah went to Samson tell me your secret Samson where does your your strength lie come on Samson I need to know I want it to I want it too well and he gave him gave her some riddles right you know the story he wanted to know where the strength lith because Satan knows he knows There Is Power of a vow that's kept and the longer you keep it the longer you keep it the stronger it gets it is a sacrifice where you have to separate yourself from unbelief where you have to separates yourself from the things of the world and it's hard when your desire is worldly and you're trying to serve two masters but being dedicated to one thing is not hard when you put your whole heart into it when you make your decision from the depths of your soul that as for me and my heart house we will serve the Lord forever but hey your job is not going to be there you're not going to have any friends the kids at school are not going to say you're [Music] popular did you make a decision in your heart well that's why we're here tonight if you haven't made that decision the Lord is here and the ministry they're like the coaches they're here to encourage you make the decision you have life or death but the Bible tells you choose life choose it choose life but sometimes we can't get out of our own way when we're young people and Samson couldn't get out of his way and he told the secret to Delila my strength lith in the locks of my hair you see because when I was born the Lord dedicated to me dedicated me to the Lord and I took the vow this is how she raised me and my hair was long so you know the story that they came in and they cut off his locks and maybe tonight your parents dedicated you to the Lord and you may have said but I lost my joy for the things of the Lord I don't have strength to go help the pastor I'm just not feeling it it it doesn't do anything for me go help brother Seth I guess and maybe the desire is not there anymore because you lost the joy of the Lord the joy of the the Lord is my strength you forgot your original purpose in life and maybe your eyes were plucked out just like Samson's and you feel that the Lord can't help me anymore and you're just groaning maybe in a bad place in your life where you don't think the Lord wants you anymore how could anybody help me for the evil that I have done when when my sin is soever before me but just wait you might be struggling here tonight but the Lord is here and give it time keep coming to church even when you don't want to oh man service [Music] again but sometimes you got to just talk to yourself you can't expect nobody else to do it maybe you hear somebody else it's like when uh the parents tell something to the kids you should do this this will solve your problem yeah whatever they don't know what they're talking about and then another person comes over to you and tells you the same thing you should do this because this is how you get past your obstacle why didn't I think of that where did you come up with that from golly what inspiration you have I'm going to listen I'm going to listen why do we do that because that's how kids are I'm my new parent but the locks hold something for you they did something for Samson as he was just being beat up by the Philistines I can't see anything someone lead me I'm good for nothing that dirty woman she tricked me she didn't want anything to do with me and the world really doesn't care about you let me rephrase the world absolutely doesn't care about you about who you are only just because they want you to not fulfill your purpose it's all a distraction G they don't want to know who you are and what you they don't want you to know who you are they want to pluck your eyes out maybe we could tear them up that way they want to pluck your spiritual eyes out but at last time I checked since we're born in the message it is a privilege like no other and I didn't realize this and when I was a young child but as you grow and you go places you talk to different people and you're just different but I'm a Christian too that is weird because when I go to church the Lord called me to be different just come out to drink with us the Bible don't say that it says don't defile your body in any way don't drink want to be different the Lord's calling you to be different you're not like anybody else you're a chosen people a chosen generation you are beautiful in the sight of God in this day and age he doesn't want you to be the same like other churches bride is not the same because when they believe the Lord they do it with all their hearts they took a Nazarite vow and every child of Abraham every child of Abraham when he comes to the Lord he takes that Nazarite V you were called to be different young people know not to be weirdos different from the world does it throw your soul to be called different come on young people do you want to be different do you want to look the same cuz the Lord told you come on and step on now step on out separate yourself come on separate yourself we don't do those things we got a higher purpose here on Earth do you know what your purpose is when I was a young purpose uh young person I would always ask myself that Lord what purpose would I have and I was so busy living up to my parents until into instead of living to God they taught me to have fear the lord which is a great thing but you have to seek the Lord the parents as much as they wanted me to be a certain way and to get it instantaneous as much as I want the young people to get it like that it doesn't happen such but it takes an action from each and every one of you I can preach everything until my voice goes out and I will because I love you so much I love each and every one of you not just the young people because the Lord loved me when he called me I would go and is is that is that what is the Lord calling me why would he call me and they would say go listen again go listen again stay in church get the word inside of you eat this all up it's a little boring I don't understand it yet but as I as I turn I just kept pushing and pushing and they would describe it to me but one day I had to have my own personal experience you have to have your own personal experience with God and it's a choice that I can't even make for you and today if you hear the voice of the Lord if you hear him knocking on your heart I challenge you open your heart to the Lord we open we have no problem opening ourselves to anything or everything that the world gives us but I challenge you tonight open yourself to the Lord let it let him talk to you tonight because Paul knew something about the Nazarite V he knew that you have to surrender yourself to the Lord he knew that he had to crucify his old man he would always want to die to himself so that the Lord can be resurrected in his life so that the Lord could use him and he would tell you I beseech you therefore Brethren Romans 121 by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy accept able unto the Lord which is your reasonable service oh it's hard because you're trying how can you live and be sacrificed at the same time sure it's hard but he says I urge you if you do nothing in this world I urge you as the number one priority behold attention I beseech you you want to make your life easier on yourself present yourself to the Lord I've been coming to church since I was a kid but maybe your heart is not in church I've been in the message since I was born but let the message come into you let it come and fill your heart it is our Prophet William Bram Willam who who saw you in the vision and he himself separated himself for you he sacrificed himself for you when he may have thought he was all alone at some but look at you now I think when he would see it when he would see you oh it would do him so good know you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you you have of God and ye are not your own you are not your own but I tell you today you are not your own but I want to do this and I want to do that and I want to go be a great somebody you're not your own as he would stand you are not your own don't let that frighten you because because you should be excited that you're his you're his today and he wants you to know that but he wants you to make the decision today to open your heart to the Lord to reach out to him and say Lord with everything that I [Music] have I separate myself I want to give you of myself today Lord the world doesn't understand it why would you fast what are you doing that for why do you pray to God why do you go to church all the time as the musicians would come why do you do all these things cuz my life is not my own my life is not my own for a period of time I thought it was and I try to run away from the things of the Lord but when I made it my choice it made everything easier because I was single-minded my eyes were open to look upon him my ear did yield to him it did yield to the Lord and I said Lord this is the day that I have died tired of running Lord Would You Close Your Eyes young people maybe you haven't gotten there yet maybe you already gave your heart to the Lord but the Lord is still calling for those that are lost is here he is here you don't have to fear anymore you don't even have to worry about tomorrow but the one thing that you have to worry about is what you do right now with the Lord and he wants you tonight Lord Jesus I said everything that you wanted me to say Lord because you're my everything Lord I can't do life without you lord Jesus and I never would want to think that Lord but Lord I urge your young people Lord the older people the people of this church Lord Lord you see how the hard work that they put in Lord because they know what you're going to do Lord Jesus they believe on you Lord there is great faith here and they set this church this beautiful Church Lord for your honor and glory and I ask Lord that if there is anybody that hasn't received you Lord into their heart as their personal savior and they haven't been born again or maybe just felt a little tingle down their spine one service and they're up and down all the time Lord I ask you to prick their heart Lord that this weekend Lord would not be like any other weekend that it would change their life Lord I never thought you could change my life Lord but Lord you are a worker of Miracles and you make way you made the way when I couldn't see it Lord Lord I just Trust
