[8:51] gusto in English and I like the way it
[8:52] said it in English
[8:55] that's in Scripture that we're going to
[8:57] read okay
[8:59] say behold I will send you I will send
[9:03] you
[9:05] Elijah the prophet they sayaki yours
[9:08] Prophet Elias in English
[9:12] in English it says
[9:15] Spanish in Spanish says
[9:23] it goes directly to you it is
[9:44] [Music]
[9:53] because it's not for everyone
[9:56] not everyone is going to receive
[9:59] he was sent to you amen amen
[10:02] that's why we're happy
[10:37] if we got up this morning
[10:45] with food in our homes
[10:48] with health but it's almost when they
[10:52] see those other than we're blessed
[10:54] you've given us so much
[10:57] and this morning we come to your house
[11:03] to hear you
[11:06] so you can help us
[11:10] place the service in your hands
[11:13] place myself
[11:22] at the end of this discussion
[11:27] that we can be able to leave like those
[11:29] walking on the road
[11:36] these words
[11:40] that you place that in us
[11:44] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[11:48] you may be seated
[11:50] and those is a
[12:17] and in the last week
[12:20] it was split into two amen amen
[12:39] the Forerunner is someone who points
[13:41] so then he told us
[13:52] are you guys
[14:05] [Music]
[14:28] or how many were watching a movie
[14:37] this is uh
[14:40] correct so the right time to plan
[14:47] now you have to have the right time
[14:53] even when you go and buy your seeds at
[14:55] Walmart
[14:59] it gives you a certain time
[15:02] and that's the the time frame you have
[15:04] to sewing
[15:06] if you plant them before
[15:10] then you're not going to reap anything
[15:16] the Lord knows
[15:46] the Bible says
[16:09] [Music]
[16:47] foreign
[17:01] because there was something in you amen
[17:04] amen
[17:08] um
[17:09] when he came to Rahab and foreign
[17:19] how did he find Rahab
[17:22] she was a prostitute amen
[17:26] she lived with other men
[17:32] she wasn't a wife
[17:34] she was a harlot
[17:37] and when uh Joshua came here and he
[17:41] spoke the message
[17:44] she believed it amen amen
[17:47] and when she believed
[17:51] she accepted the message
[17:54] she accepted the message amen amen this
[17:57] is
[18:11] the
[18:19] mouth of God
[18:54] so there's a time to sew scripture
[19:06] [Music]
[19:11] is
[19:20] that he always came to women that
[19:22] weren't living a very good life
[19:24] is uh
[19:30] foreign
[19:51] [Music]
[20:36] that's what the Lord looks at amen amen
[20:40] yeah
[20:43] now this precursor
[20:46] he comes and gives a
[20:50] significant
[20:52] what is going on here
[20:58] is the second coming of the Lord this is
[21:03] like this
[21:05] um
[21:08] this is
[21:11] signs of his coming
[21:19] the prophecies oh it's a great day that
[21:21] we're now living in different
[21:25] earthquakes places pestilence
[21:29] Jesus
[21:31] all those things that Jesus spoke of is
[21:33] here
[21:36] he says to my way of seeing it
[21:40] I don't see anything left
[21:46] when I hear people say oh it can't
[21:48] happen
[22:06] he says I don't see anything left
[22:11] but the coming of the Lord is at hand
[22:13] amen amen

[22:21] how many are waiting for is coming are
[22:25] you ready
[22:29] how are you this evening would you be
[22:31] ready
[22:36] I I heard when they asked my mother that
[22:38] question
[22:40] and they asked are you ready
[22:44] she had to be sure
[22:48] she had to be a hundred percent
[22:52] she couldn't have a shadow of a doubt
[22:54] that she was ready
[22:57] for us this morning
[22:59] are we ready Brothers
[24:00] amen seniority
[25:00] I'm waiting for you
[25:03] amen amen
[25:08] the scripture says there in Luke Chapter
[25:10] 15.
[25:13] this is
[25:27] either what woman having 10 pieces of
[25:29] silver if she lose one piece peace does
[25:32] not light a candle and sweep the house
[25:34] and seek diligently till she find it
[25:35] this is
[25:39] in those days the woman didn't use a
[25:42] ring
[25:44] what she used was a was a necklace
[25:48] or she used a crown she had a medals she
[25:54] had coins
[25:55] on her crown
[25:59] so when she did something that was
[26:01] incorrect is
[26:06] when the people seen that that woman was
[26:08] found in adults or that she was
[26:10] gossiping correct I thought she was done
[26:13] doing something in Korea
[26:14] they brought her before the priest
[26:17] and the priest
[26:20] if it was true what had happened
[26:25] would remove a coin from her from her
[26:27] crap amen amen
[26:32] those were the vows tourists
[26:44] she took that coin he took that coin
[26:47] amen amen
[26:50] Dishonored her husband
[26:55] Lord have mercy the prophet says
[27:16] we've almost lost all of our coins
[27:21] we've about lost all of our coins
[27:29] but the fruit of the spirit is
[27:32] how many of us has lost love
[27:41] a tremendous message
[27:44] and he said love your enemies
[27:48] Brothers we can't love the one who loves
[27:50] us

[32:45] may the Lord bless you
[32:47] [Applause]
[32:55] bendiga
[32:57] God bless you
[33:02] are happy uh
[33:07] let's open up our scriptures
[33:10] um
[33:11] the the Lucas to the Book of Luke
[33:17] said is a Lucas
[33:21] to Luke chapter three
[33:24] um
[33:32] how many are happy
[33:42] Luke 3 2 says
[33:54] being the high priest the word of God
[33:57] came unto unto John the son of Zachary
[34:00] Zacharias Zacharias in the wilderness
[34:05] I want you to notice here yeah
[34:11] there were the priests at that time
[34:16] but the word didn't come to them
[34:19] the scripture says that the word came to
[34:21] John amen amen
[34:28] God does things in a strange way
[34:30] [Music]
[34:33] to God for that
[34:36] he has a strange message
[34:43] he also has a strange group of people
[34:46] that they're unique
[34:48] identification and they identified
[34:51] with a message
[34:53] that is very unique as well amen amen uh
[34:58] [Music]
[35:23] El profeta
[35:27] [Music]
[35:33] as it is written in the prophets behold
[35:36] I send my messenger before thy face
[35:38] which shall prepare the thy way before
[35:40] thee he said
[35:45] um
[35:54] and the following scripture says the
[35:56] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[35:57] prepare ye the way of the Lord make his
[35:59] path straight
[36:02] I think that when one goes ahead
[36:05] in Europe
[36:09] it's not a very easy job
[36:18] I think he could identify with his
[36:20] college
[36:23] because when I've shared a little with
[36:26] my children
[36:29] I share that when sometimes when you
[36:32] have plans
[36:37] the one who's preparing a party or a
[36:40] wedding event or any kind of a great
[36:43] event it
[37:07] you see that in the olden times when you
[37:10] were prepared for the coming of a king
[37:26] [Music]
[38:12] I don't know foreign
[40:09] amen amen
[40:13] the Messiah
[40:26] it says Like This is
[40:30] Gospel ain't going to shake the world
[40:48] the church has been shook like it never
[40:51] has been before this is
[40:58] supposed to shake the world
[41:02] they're dead
[41:17] and the people say why did why doesn't
[41:19] the world hear it
[41:26] it's not for everyone
[41:28] this message
[41:32] the message that's criticized
[41:36] but a message
[41:40] I guess the greater things amen Brothers
[41:43] I believe that
[41:46] and when you're criticized
[41:50] I imagine John
[41:54] knew what criticism was
[41:57] [Music]
[41:59] you know what criticism was
[42:03] because in his times
[42:15] [Music]
[42:19] and how we dress ourselves with
[42:21] religions
[42:28] John came dresses
[42:47] he wasn't dressed in religion
[42:50] so then John was criticized
[42:54] and look at this
[42:58] it's implicit
[43:06] you didn't have to dress a certain way
[43:11] how the religious world of that day
[43:15] to be recognized by God amen amen
[43:20] ities
[43:24] Brothers entonces
[43:32] he was simply happy
[43:35] with being the voice concerns we're
[43:39] simply being the voice
[43:46] he didn't care
[43:50] he didn't care just uh being the voice
[43:55] just being the voice of God
[44:01] God gives us nothing else
[45:00] someone is preparing the ground
[45:13] the president of the United States would
[45:15] have come to Fort Collins
[45:56] in our terms
[46:34] he was evening things out it's located
[46:38] that's what he did
[46:40] it was a rugged job
[46:44] that was very rugged
[46:46] and it was so rugged
[46:52] that when John is
[46:55] when he was preaching on the edge of the
[46:57] Jewish
[47:04] go into the Seas to preachers
[47:30] what God was doing there
[47:45] come and see uh something spectacular
[47:48] foreign
[47:52] Jesus said
[47:55] that they went to see
[48:00] because they were only going to see
[48:03] they weren't here
[48:11] with a message
[49:01] for absolutely all of us
[49:05] I believe it
[49:11] God help us Brothers
[49:16] the job that John had
[49:21] her brother Guillermo expressed
[49:26] how it is that when you open up when you
[49:29] when you till or plow the soil
[49:32] um
[49:37] that's the most difficult part
[49:40] is it's the most difficult part
[49:44] it's a message
[49:47] the message
[49:48] being a forerunner
[49:52] it made the people uncomfortable
[49:55] it was a very uncomfortable message
[49:58] foreign
[50:32] [Applause]
[50:39] we all needed
[50:52] [Music]
[51:30] that's where it was
[51:34] that's where John came from
[51:38] and that's why uh
[51:48] very special job for you
[51:52] very special job
[52:00] a job
[52:04] that is that is painful
[52:10] because when you're different
[52:13] you believe in a message that's
[52:14] different
[52:17] it comes with a lot of Solitude
[52:23] a lot of solitude
[52:28] over there in the desert
[52:31] and I imagine as a young man
[52:36] he was maybe playing with uh
[52:39] with the snakes
[52:44] we didn't have a lot of toys
[52:46] station didn't have a PlayStation
[52:51] he didn't have an iPhone
[52:58] and sometimes we're crying
[53:01] because we don't have the most recent
[53:03] things
[53:30] amen
[53:49] amen
[53:50] yes and the message
[53:53] he was hurting Brothers
[53:56] he was plowing he was plowing
[53:59] he was plowing the Earth he put in some
[54:01] businesses
[54:32] although we know that the seed
[54:35] we know it was already planted
[54:38] but there are many things
[55:37] don't worry
[56:02] do something for him yeah
[56:06] that's what John did yesterday and I'm
[56:09] closing with this
[56:13] is
[56:14] sometimes it feels
[56:18] when we work yes
[56:25] [Music]
[56:29] when someone is working for God
[56:34] my business there are times
[56:40] that there's disappointment
[56:44] I imagine our pastor
[56:47] it feels disappointment sometimes
[56:50] when the people don't listen
[56:53] when the people aren't working
[56:56] when he's giving his all yeah and he
[57:00] gets here
[57:01] and the people aren't doing anything
[57:06] you can throw in the towel at any time
[57:09] but he has to attend to a colleague
[57:12] there
[58:13] to the word
[58:16] and it's time
[58:26] we get up in the mornings
[58:41] you're not going to be successful every
[58:43] time
[58:45] not even Jesus was successful in all
[58:48] things Brothers
[58:50] and the scripture says
[58:54] that he couldn't do anything in some
[58:56] places
[58:57] because of the unbelief that was there
[59:00] that's scriptural Brothers
[59:03] God knew looked
[59:06] what it was like to not be successful
[59:13] you're not successful
[59:16] you won't be successful in all things
[59:20] and John wasn't always successful
[59:23] and when the people came
[59:28] in in their hearts
[59:41] or just criticizing
[59:43] people laughing at it and inviting
[59:47] everyone
[59:56] he didn't even call himself a prophet
[1:00:03] one day he got up in the morning
[1:00:05] [Music]
[1:00:06] and they're at the Jordan River
[1:00:10] baptizing the people you go Uno there
[1:00:13] came one this is and the scripture says
[1:00:18] the scripture says that heaven
[1:00:21] and a Dove came down
[1:00:27] lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:47] he said here am I
[1:00:50] or he behold here's the Lamb of God
[1:01:41] you've been criticized
[1:01:54] he knows
[1:01:56] what you need
[1:02:00] the correct time
[1:02:02] correct in the right season
[1:02:08] what God can do
[1:02:10] you just accept it
[1:02:18] because the king
[1:02:20] yes he sent a message
[1:02:30] it's all been revealed
[1:02:34] that John bro but I said for that time
[1:02:40] explicitly expressing the thoughts of
[1:02:42] God
[1:02:45] I believe that that's what God wants to
[1:02:47] do
[1:02:48] is when you prepare yourself
[1:03:06] [Music]
[1:03:07] all things work for the good
