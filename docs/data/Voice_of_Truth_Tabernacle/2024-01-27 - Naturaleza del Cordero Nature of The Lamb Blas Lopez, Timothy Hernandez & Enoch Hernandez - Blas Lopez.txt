to be here dwell amongst the brothers in the presence of the Lord how many are happy Brothers why don't you give a clap offering to the Lord we're standing if you'll go quickly reading the word Luke chapter 2 verse 48 we're still speaking on our lord Jesus was a youth say Amen Brothers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother and his mother said unto him son why hast thou dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee Sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me was ye not know that I must be about my father's business and they understood not the same which he spoke unto them and he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these saying in her heart and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and manay brothers if you can close your eyes gracious heavenly father father we come before your presence asking you Lord You Lord to help us Lord give us the understanding of your only you can reveal it to us I ask you for my interpreter other man who will be sharing with me for the audience the children that you give us a peaceful spirit father but because we're doing this for your honor and For Your Glory we're speaking on Obed humility and we believe Lord that we come with a humble and a contrite heart to hear your holy word help us father ask this in the precious name Savior Jesus Christ amen amen if you're so kind to take your seat we're going to be reading one more scripture we continue to speak on our Lord Jesus Christ how many like the word how many like the word Brothers the word of God Brothers it's life it's truly the word of God Brothers it brings us closer to God let's read 1 Corinthians 13:11 the word of the Lord says like this when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things we're reading this biblical passage and last week my brothers Isaac and brother Marshall they spoken of this same verse because we're understanding brother have you thought have you put yourself what was the Lord Jesus doing what did he want to do he was a youth he was a youth he the word says He was around 12 years old and we know through the prophet that between 12 and 13 years old a youth Brothers they go into their youth or they go into a young adulthood they go past the age of accountability he's no longer going to have excuses you're no longer going to have excuses if you're 12 or 13 years old you're not going to be able to say over there I didn't hear speak the Lord or they didn't tell me anything Brothers at that age you're responsible for your actions you brothers and I we're in the same boat this evening Brothers we have the prophetic word the most certain word is this word outside of this brother there's nothing we have the message of the hour Brothers we know Brothers Through The Prophet that he he came to fulfill the word of the Lord he didn't to lose time or just waste time he came humble showing the world in the Old Testament that is they spoke of a lamb was going to be slain where did they find him found sitting in the temple on Easter what was celebrated on Easter Brothers every man Brothers had to take a dove for the sacrifice but the sacrifice was there seated there was a sacrifice Brothers Brothers in this evening the Lord is here the Lord is here in the same way waiting to hear from you you have questions deceive me here's the Lord Brothers he can answer them the word of the Lord says that he was seated sitting down those doctors of the law right brothers and he would answer he didn't keep silent he he answered them what does a youth do today of 13 years of age I was hearing our brother because I hear every I don't have I don't have I don't have any favor the word of the lord it's life brother I hear everyone my brother and my brother Marsh last Friday and I was hearing brother Alden as well those that preach Brothers it's all a blessing it's all a blessing the prophet shows us that if you or someone if you don't like something puts it like a cherry pie you're eating a cherry pie right and sometimes that that pie has the pit in [Music] it he says that he takes that which is good and throws out that and that's the way I believe with all of my heart that this message and in this word everything is edible nothing is thrown out and I tell you that I want to read a little bit because I believe in my heart Brothers of 13 years of age he shouldn't be relaxed sometimes the youth don't want to come to church I was also a youth at one point don't think that but at one point I was young I went through that Brothers a youth can have a lot of excus to not come to church he can say well I have a lot of homework I'm not gonna go because I feel a little sick I was feeling sick today I couldn't even speak but Brothers Brothers I believe in the Lord and I believe in Divine Healing as well the prophet says the doctors give you medicine and you take it right but the Lord is the one who gives a healing well if you believe it if you believe it forgive me are you happy Brothers how many can say glory to God Brothers how many can say I believe God Amen brother I also believe him the word says I like this because the prophet said lean not unto your own understand many people go off based off of their own understanding they say they can say I think this I think that that is leaning on our own understanding we have the word of the Lord and this is our it's not in the word then do away with ask God Be Still as Mary brothers look at what she's saying here but they did not understand the words she spoke but she kept all these things in her heart and she didn't understand everything she didn't understand everything I don't understand everything either but I believe it I keep it in my heart Brothers oh this isn't that way because I haven't heard it but I believe it right later on Brothers in our walk God is going to give us understanding of what that meant to say lead not unto your own understanding education it it it'll last and it will give you a good job look as the prophet said I'm not telling the youth not to go and get an education or for them to be illiterate you have to continue on you have to put God first it's God at 13 years old he might have wanted to be with May playing PlayStation online oh Brothers I see how much because I have youth pray day after day the example Brothers set them the example because that's what the Lord is telling you I don't tell you anything truly pray for every one of them also going to share um oh I'm adding a little bit to my trailer and I I scolded my son Christopher very and I felt so bad brothers I asked him for forgiveness Brothers it's because you have to be humble and also respect what they do many times Brothers you have have to live the word for them you have to live the word so that they can believe it how are you going to want them to come to church if the dad if the head of the family the dad doesn't want to go how can you set an example to your children thankful with the Lord truly right brothers and at the same time brother I want to I want to I have two minutes my time almost up but I also want to send my condolences to our sister y's family of our sister FL Brothers I know what it feels like to lose a nephew truly something painful because we know brother that when a member of the body of the Lord Jes hurts rest also joined with them and I send my condolences blessed be the Lord God sometimes lets us go through trial so that we can see brother he hasn't left us he with us Brothers he is there Al we might not see he's there with us I'm going to read a little I know that time flies that we're here in eternity when we're here Brothers the word Brothers I believe with all of my heart the Eternal Word of God it says education will bring you a good job possibly a position among and that's fine which will probably be a great help to you it will help you economic helping to sustain yourself perhaps it make a little bit better for you the prophet it says but remember child remember my son he says one day you're going to die oh Brothers you're not going to want to die without God one day you're GNA die he says after that listen young man young lady education is good put God first Brothers God God is the beginning of all wisdom if you want wisdom understand then ask God and God will give it to you godess I don't want to go over my may God bless you time flies amen the nature of the Lamb and now I want you to really think on that for a moment you know because the nature of a lamb you know the nature of a lamb is something that is subtle it's it's sweet you know when God you know God humbled himself so much that Jesus submitted himself says own parents now I don't think I don't think you guys are understanding this for me exploited my mind for for because of a because of God yeah how can God this almighty God come down to earth and be submitted to his own creation Now I think that should be enough for us that's enough for me how God can humble himself so much now we already read in Luke 2 verse 51 you don't have to turn your pages it says and he went down with them and came to Nazareth now this is the word that really intrigues me a lot it says and was subject unto them how many of us are subject to our pastor youth brother young man young lady how many of you are subject to your own parents how many of you obey your own parents I guess there's none here you know but you know in order for you to be obedient you have to be humble and that's what Jesus was Jesus was humble that's enough for me brothers and sisters if you can take something tonight brother sister you know among all the Miracles and surprises that you know surrounding God himself you know you know Luke 2 verse 51 you know it may sound like the most unexpected thing like the most unexpected amen and when I think of Jesus in this young man you know at the age of 12 as the Bible mentions you know when Jesus was over there doing the works of God you know when I think of that you know it makes me want to to a certain point want to feel like I'm not enough you know because at the age of 12 I don't know what I was doing James 4:10 says says humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up and he shall lift you up you know what does the word humble mean to us what does the word humble mean to us youth what does it mean to you and the message the worst sinner in the city it says like this and when we think we're somebody's because we wear good clothing and ride a nice car shame on you it's a Pity that we got so far away from God I I can say that for myself there's many times in my life you know where I've gone so far away from God you know but there's something about Jesus you know that draws me that doesn't let me leave and I believe many of us can say the same thing something about that so few brother says I hate to say this but so few profess Christians today in our land profess today in our land know so little about God they know so little about God but to know God humbled himself that's what makes him great to me that's what makes him real to me think that he was willing to come down here and not be some great somebody take some great name or something like that he made himself humble and became a servant to all of them that's my Lord Jesus that's the one I love you love him tonight I want to give my life entirely to serve him how many can say the same thing tonight you know don't get me wrong you know us as Youth and I believe all of us youth can relate Ro can get a little bit bumpy am I right in the message humble thyself he says brother says the Way Up Is Down always he goes on saying if you want Power see how humble you can get my that's that's that's something for me that's personally for myself it's something that just explodes my mind just get away from all your your worldly thinking yourself before God and then you've got more power than the man that runs all over the buildings that makes a big lot of noise see because you have been able to conquer yourself and commit yourself to Christ you see to humble yourself before him that's really power how many of us are obedient I'm not saying you aren't but how many are obedient to what God tells you to do and and it takes it takes to be submissive I was talking to my dad earlier and and I he told me you know what is it to really be submissive you know because when somebody gets married you know of course the wife is sub submitt it to the husband but do they just do it does she just do it because she wants to or is it because out of love and I I I do believe that it takes love the the God's word no to God's word takes love for God's word am I right you do need love I want to read this me message too the message faith is our victory and that's the way it is with human life you can't play the rules of the game of Life wrong and expect you expect to win you've got to play it according to God's word and the purpose that you were brought here for now I I want us I want to get to a certain point you know and when you humble yourself and you're obedient to your parents to your pastor to God to God I believe that we can find our purpose continues on saying now there's so many people that doesn't seem to have any kind of purpose in life especially in this day that we live now people just seem to think that they have they have to do is keep up with somebody else with the Fashions of this world and with the enticement that the world has given to them just like this if you go to school and some of the little girls wear a certain little frock or dress or whatever you would call it and the ambition and the ambition the rest of the school has is to pattern after that girl now I want you to keep up with me some of the women see see on the television some certain lady come out andess and dress in a certain fashion well that's your ambition is to dress and act like that and that seems to just be about the limit of the American ambition to get a new job or to get a raise in your salary and to get a television or a new car let me say this those things may be all right but there's higher Ambitions in the human life than those things and Christians to set their affection on higher Ambitions that's what Jesus did Jesus Jesus wasn't here to please man here to please his father that was in heaven and why is it so hard for us that's the question that I've meditated is it so hard for me why is it so hard for me me to [Music] be to let myself be controlled in other words be guided by God continues on saying and I think it would pay us all to sit down and wonder why we are here and and ever who was kind enough to bring us here we we ought to consider and ask him what we what he would have us to do the purpose of Us coming to fulfill what he has purposed for us I'm sorry no you're okay and then this is this is where I I found the answer to my question but we seem to be just wanting to keep up with the world I I I believe that's true youth brother sister I mean can you can you are you with me you know and and sometimes you know we we just want to do our own thing or we want to kind of backslide a little bit you know but I truly believe that you're here for a purpose youth it's it's it might be hard it might be hard let me tell you it's possible With God all things are possible my brother can come forward uh if I would just like to leave you with with with a thought something that you can meditate on if God didn't humble himself where would we be God bless your brothers and [Applause] sister may you please stand for a little moment here please the scpt to [Music] John and then we'll jump to 14 verse and the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was no and the Word was with God and the Word was God verse 14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the one of the begotten of the father full of grace and truth now let us go to Ezekiel 36 verse 26 you may not have heard before but I take them from brother brandham say a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of Flesh this is the new birth verse 27 says I will put my spirit within you and cause you to to walk in my statute statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them this is the statue of a perfect man you may be seated I would like to speak a little bit about Jesus that is the theme but when I heard what I heard I thought it was a little difficult to believe knew Jesus is not God okay I'll explain it now okay um when Jesus was born he born as the he was born as the Lamb of God and as we read in St John 1 the word was made flesh but Jesus did not have God inside of him you might say oh it's because he was God he was flesh and when John saw him and he said here is the Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world and he saw the holy spirit in the form of a dove that's where the father dwelt in Jesus it's a little bit difficult to digest okay now let us go to the beginning how many of you know that Jesus was the second Adam so to understand the second Adam let us go back to the first Adam amen amen so let's go to Genesis 1 and man is formed there and God created him according to his form according to His Image he created male and female and God created him there in spirit but when we go to Genesis 27 it says that God God forms Man Out of the Dust of the earth comma and he he put Breath of Life in him brother Bram says that when God made man of the man walked in the garden of e or on Earth without the Holy Spirit when he said that I said how could that be I thought he he had the Holy Spirit when but brother says that Adam was with a certain time before that God placed the theop that Holy Spirit the part of God in man understand that part of the first Adam then we can understand the second Adam right it's a little bit different to digest so why do I say this to create some [Music] confusion I want you to understand yourselves look now we have here man in flesh with the Holy Spirit In the Garden of Eden in this day he had two Natures he had the male nature and the female nature when Jesus Christ was in flesh he had the nature of being a lamb when he was baptized by John the Baptist the nature of the Dove came inside of him and now he has two Natures the nature of a lamb and the nature of a dove but man and the first Adam fell they allowed sin to come into his life to come to his family to come to his home and the sin created a separation from God and that's what we know it we know it as the Fallen state of man or the Fallen nature of man and in his nature every single one of us is born with it it's a nature that has desires of the flesh okay so we must understand that to come to get the nature of a lamb the nature that Jesus Christ had we must be born again so we see in Ezekiel 3626 that he will give you a new heart he gives you a new spirit there God gives you the spirit of a lamb and although you were born again you still don't have the Holy Spirit and a journey with God begins I like the way our brother blast started and the way brother Timmy end explaining a little bit on the nature of a lamb so then brother BR says difference between the foolish and the true ver the true true bride that the foolish she has the nature of a lamb she never receives the holy spirit so then let us go back a little before being born again we find with a fallen nature that constantly desires the things of the world nature believes all the propaganda that the world gives ity as the quote that Timmy gave that our nature is to have a new car of the year have a big house if it's possible a mansion that's all right none of that is wrong but if you put that in first place before God then that is incorrect but we're born with that nature we see the children us as adults we understand what a young man we understand that that young age that where you find yourself with a generation so confused by social media influencers influencers they don't know what to believe in they don't know what you believe they don't even know who they are you don't even know what their purpose is find your purpose youth until you are born again there is so much confusion in the youth also in the adults because there's people of 50 years of age who are not born again there's people of 60 years of age and they still have not been born again but if Jesus at 30 years old he did not have the Holy Spirit what made him free from Temptation Temptation was there the Bible said he was tempted in everything but what was it it was the word that maintained him firm in a state where Temptation did not Happ he just depended on the word that's why youth Jesus says to Nicodemus is necess it is it is it is necessary that you must be born again it's not an option you must be born again because if you are not born again you'll be consumed by this world so then look now I say this in a good manner and I hope hope you believe my word there is nothing out there that will give you life the only life that you will find is in his word I will say this not as a joke because to me it's as a reality because brother Bram says here is not a place to make jok but he says that a man came to the Gates of Heaven and when he got to the gates of Ken he saw there was some calm music over there and he said he saw a little letter board over there and it says look what you're missing out on so C curiy got him got to him and went to go see he said he had some binoculars and he was looking to hell and when he saw through the binoculars there was a great part people were laughing they were having a good time and he left Heaven he went down to Hell and when he got to hell he found that it was a lake of fire that everyone in hell was suffering but he already made his choice but what was that that I saw he said it was just propaganda and that's the reality that devil offers to you he offers life but in reality he offers death necessary and I tell you as someone who went through that no one told me this I know there's only death and death and More Death where you come to lose your personality where you can't even know yourself where you can see yourself and you can't even get one penny to yourself you please stand although Jesus Christ came to have the nature of a lamb he came to have the Holy Spirit the same Holy Spirit left him in bet and when he was on the cross he said father in your hands I give you my spirit What Spirit was he surrendering on the CR it was not the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit already left him it was the spirit of a lamb that brought him to the Cross he was so obedient even obedient to that's where every single one of you every single one of us have to get to we have to leave this flesh leave the things of the world and come to the three stages of Grace you don't have to wait you're already in a body of sin you're already a body of work worldliness that's the nature we have right now it's a fallen nature but he wants you to have his nature the nature of a lamb and he showed you that it can be done and he told God wherever I may be I want them to them to be there as well Celestial father I place your people I know they are struggling Lord because I'm struggling single step of the way [Music] Lord I see blood leaving trails it's not easy father we hold on to your word we hold on to your calling believing that whoever started the work is the same
