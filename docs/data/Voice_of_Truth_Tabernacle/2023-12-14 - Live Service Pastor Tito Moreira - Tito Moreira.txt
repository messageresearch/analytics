[Music] amen clap offering to our [Music] Lord amen I just want to read one scripture we have a testimonies tonight and some words for you but I just want to read one scripture before we have the testimon ROM Romans 8 R Romans chapter 8 we'll read from verse 35 I'm glad to see everyone we're getting close to the end of the year and I think it's great time to testify I'm sure we had battles maybe some failures but above all the Lord has preserved us till now and it's good to speak of him people need to know and hear what he has done you and I can't help them but he can help them that's why we should speak to them about [Music] him we do not point to ourselves everything has been God God has been everything God has been everything amen I want to read verse 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ tribulation distress pers nakedness Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter now in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I'm that neither death nor life Angels principalities powers or things present nor things to come nor height nor nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord and I want to read this quote from the prophet that says this about God's love and I'll let you have your seats this is the love of God no wonder the poet said would we with ink the ocean fill and were the Skies of parchment made and every stock on earth a quill and every man a scribe by trade to write the love of God above would drain the ocean dry nor could the scroll contain the whole though stretch from Sky to Sky that is God's love brother say that is God's love see the love of God says brother BR after man had fallen and deliberately opened the door to the enemy now put yourself here because we deliberately many times I've opened the door to the enemy and he come in and marred him set death in him still God was not willing to be defeated he came down and started all over again he was going to make that man again that is the love of God we should speak of what he has done let us pray Heavenly Father put ourselves in your hands Lord Lord as we hear some of these testimonies may they be of benefit and edification motive us to press on but above all Lord we want to glorify your name because you're the one that deserves all glory and honor you're the reason why we're still standing and everything we have is by your grace because we have more than what we deserve because you haven't paid us according to our sin nor to towards our iniquities you helped us Time After Time Lord and I believe it's worth it to speak about you like brother brandham said if they have accused me of one thing is to speak too much about him and brother B says we can never speak too much about him so Lord put these testimonies in your hands in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen May and our sister Sharon can begin God bless you this is one of many testimonies I have in 2012 the enemy tried to derail me from the ways of the Lord that God had prepared for me and I began with a pain in my stomach my father took me to the hospital and they told me that my colon was inflamed so I felt my pain was at a level five and I told my father and they gave me treatment and they sent me home and as they went by I said you know what I couldn't eat anything everything I ate I would vomit and the pain continued to grow until a week went by and I told my father I feel like something swells in my stomach if you don't take me to the I don't think I'm going to make it my father took me I remember it was on a Saturday we lived close to my uncle and they took me to the ER I couldn't speak anymore because of the strong pain and they did an exam they did an ultrasound and they still couldn't find anything but the next day they found out that in the ultrasound my appendicitis was leaking and they transferred me to El Paso uh they put a catheter on me and then they returned me to the hospital and when they returned me to the hospital my skin was turning red because my stomach was about to explode on the inside so they called the doctor in the ER and on Monday I was in an emergency surgery because it had exploded and it was in affecting my areas inside me or ruptured inside me I was in a lot of pain and they did a bigger incision than normal more because they had to cut my intestine panc pancreas and my stomach I spent in the hospital almost a month for all of the damage of the appendicitis had done uh it was difficult when I had operations or surgeries um but I'm thankful with God despite going through all those problems God was always there for me my parents had to work and I had to stay in the hospital and it was a tough situation because there was no one there to help me use the restroom or get dressed but I give thanks to God because he's always been there when I need him the most and I know he'll always be there no matter what the enemy says I know he's always been my hero and that's why I love him more every [Applause] day God bless [Music] you I want to give my testimony how God has worked through me all these years I was always raised in a Christian household and for being rebellious I left church but before that I told the Lord give me permission I'm going to go but let me return well don't let me return with a broken limb or anything uh damaged from me and that's how he did it he returned me he returned me whole I'm praising the Lord now because all of these years the Lord has been with me now when I told the Lord I want to serve him better I told him to put me in a place where I could do my best he he gave me a dream and I could see where the Sun would rise Washington and I thought it was in another place I was in Washington and it wasn't there and my heart told me it wasn't there when I came to Colorado my heart told me it's in Colorado and God has been with me this far I came by faith we didn't have anywhere to stay but God had everything prepared for us brother Titus had an apartment ready for us and everything it wasn't just for us but it was for us in that time time we came only believing in the Lord and that's how the Lord has been dealing with me everything I've asked the Lord he has granted me I can't say God doesn't exist because God has been in every moment of my life every person God has put in my path is for a blessing and I'm very glad and thankful with the Lord for everything has given me in these years here this is the first part and I'll tell you the second part of my husband later God bless [Applause] you God bless you Brothers I'd like to share with you my [Music] experience how my sister said we were raising a Christian home all my life in this message my mother tells and I'd like to tell when I was born I was born with allergies a lot of spots on my body I was a very young girl all of my life it was always kind of shameful for me because I would go to sleep more and I would wake up with a rash on my face or a rash on my throat all of my body my head everywhere it was something impossible to overtake for me it was a tough burden I didn't understand why that happened to me or why me I remember always cried and asked God to heal me I didn't want to live that way no more my mother tried to treat me with anything took me to the doctor everything normal everything was normal one time in church I was 15 and the Pastor said raise your hand who wanted to be baptized who had the desire to be baptized and I did I did it with all my heart and I remember that day went to the river brother baptized [Music] me and as I was in the water I raised my hands and said Lord here I give you I give up my sickness I don't want it anymore I can't stand this anymore entire life all my life I couldn't withstand the pain the the shame that people would stare at me that day I raised my hands and I said deler you everything heal me I don't want this anymore and they took me to the waters I was baptized I remember when I stepped out I felt different and I not remembering about the rashes or the allergies because with the breeze when there was a fresh Breeze it would rash my [Music] skin or the dust I was very [Music] allergic I remember it was at night to go out late at night with [Music] the and we would get together at a coffee place and drink and talk I remember the wind was fresh and I didn't get any rashes and I said I can't see them because you could tell on my skin and I said I don't see them anymore and I said it left it's gone until this day I don't have that I don't have it so I tell you youth God does exist he can heal you from any sickness just have faith and this is one of many testimonies I have about my life life God bless [Applause] you God bless you Brothers good evening I'm here to first of all give thanks to everyone here my family and I have been congregating here alongside everyone since February you have been very loving and received us as brothers and I give you thanks and also thanks to the pastor I have in my heart to tell about two testimonies the first one is uh in April 2019 I was 36 years old and I had a stroke and this is something that was very unexpected for me because I had no risk factors I went to go uh warm up my car one morning and then all of my right side was foggy and I got drowsy and I went to go lay down and I was calling uh my work to call in and say I couldn't come in and they told me that it sounded like I was having a stroke that I should go to the hospital this was a three days later they did some exams in the hospital and they said I did have a stroke on my left side I had a pain um then I had a pton for Amo Valley in the Superior part of my heart and I went to the cardiologist and he told me I had no reason to suffer a stroke they told me it was higher probability to have a stroke giving birth to my daughters and thanks to God it wasn't that way so they corrected that issue and I'm thankful to the Lord because there was no uh damage left on me in my body I'm not sure why the Lord wanted to test me that way I I know the complications that patients can go after having a stroke but thanks to the Lord by his grace that was not my case so I thank the Lord for that my second testimony is in January 2021 when I went to go do the second part of my uh nursing exam nursing program or nursing program um I had a lot of obstacles uh to cross due to a decision that I made I can tell you this because my faith has grown and it's elevated and I'm better spiritually now and this trial was that I trimmed my hair that was the last time I trimmed my hair and what happened after was undeniable because there were successions that happened that the Lord put in my path the first one was that my car was uh warming up outside to leave to work and some uh young people came and they stole my car but three or four days later I found my car without any damages and by this time I had already left my job and left all my benefits because I was going to begin the nursing program that was 5 minutes from my house and something else that happened that was uh like a tough punch is that I failed a Psychiatry class this for me before having a a stronger faith I couldn't even talk about this because a human ego is very [Music] weak because I had never felted a class I've passed every class in my life with A's and B's and this was the first time that failing a class hurt my ego and that was tough because humanly I was struggling I had a a tough anxiety before this I didn't have compassion for people that said they suffer with anxiety because I never had it so I say they can do something with to overcome their anxiety until you experience that in your own flesh then you can have compassion for the others because now you know how it feels the next thing that happened was that my daughter Mimi was seven years old and she fell and uh cut her waist and I took her to urgent care to get stitches this was very traumatizing for me because I took her to urgent care with an open wound and I could feel the I could see the W moving wound moving and I was just saying this was your [Music] fault the next thing that happened was through the course of three or four months we had a misunderstanding with my husband and we had some time that we were not even talking to each other it went on for about four months but uh that should not be the case because we live in a Christian home and we shouldn't um be fighting that way and none of us would intent to make peace I was living a hell I was living a hard anxiety I felt very ashamed I felt like I couldn't tell anyone or someone to support me so it was one of the worst moments of my life but now I can testify here that the lord gave me back everything to God my vehicle is a minimum but it's material but I recovered it my daughter is fine and it was only stitches she needed in her waist the Lord allowed me another opportunity to graduate and have a job but the most important and ways in my heart the most is that my faith could give a step forward because I've always been persistent in life and in professional things but that same gift of persistence I should be able to apply it to my faith I couldn't given this testimony if my faith would have not gotten stronger because I was embarrassed but now I can say I'm not embarrassed because I haven't trimed my hair since then the Devil is a devil and he brings us thoughts I've learned to tell him leave me alone and the Lord give me this Victory so thank you so much and God bless [Applause] you amen we give another clap offer to our Lord Jesus [Applause] Christ thanks to the Lord for the testimonies I believe when we testify about God our faith grows our faith grows and everyone else's Faith grows also because the small things and big things matter to God how many believe that God cares about small things and cares about big things so we Rejoice we can't wait to hear the second part of our sister Jenny's testimony am I thought she was going to say it but next time Glory God for that we thank the sisters that uh came forward God bless them I believe the men also have things to testify of it's just that sometimes the sisters are more Brave so may God bless them [Music] [Applause] um clap offering [Applause] yes there's petitions can I have them quickly I just want to read the petitions and sing some songs the musicians can come and then speak
