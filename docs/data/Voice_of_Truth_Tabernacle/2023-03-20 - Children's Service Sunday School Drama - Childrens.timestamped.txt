[36:09] yeah all right let's go on over
[36:13] just don't forget that you guys are
[36:15] gonna help me with the food later okay
[36:18] all right
[36:20] so this story is about two Christians
[36:24] the first Christian's name is sister
[36:26] Teresa
[36:28] now sister Teresa is constantly Walking
[36:31] with God
[36:33] she has peace
[36:36] and joy
[36:39] and faith
[36:42] she strengthens her faith by reading the
[36:45] word of God and listening to messages
[36:48] she's always putting it into action as
[36:50] well by prayer or sharing the gospel to
[36:53] others
[36:54] she seems like a good Christian doesn't
[36:55] she uh-huh
[36:58] now the second Christian his life is
[37:00] going a little different right now it's
[37:03] brother Pierre brother peer is going
[37:06] through a desert in his Christian
[37:07] Journey
[37:09] he's not sure why God chose him in doubt
[37:12] sometimes if he's really a child of God
[37:15] the spirit of depression
[37:18] and pride have been holding him down all
[37:21] of those evil spirits
[37:23] they've been tormenting him calling him
[37:26] a hypocrite and a liar
[37:31] they're always reminding him of his past
[37:34] and pointing out all of his flaws
[37:37] that's not really nice huh
[37:43] now brother peer he sees that his life
[37:46] isn't really going so good he's not the
[37:49] Christian that he thinks that he should
[37:50] be so he admires the life of sister
[37:54] Teresa always wishing that his could be
[37:56] just like hers
[37:58] however any time he goes to a fellow
[38:01] brother or sister from church he talks
[38:04] bad about her and this is what we call
[38:06] girls cheese man foreign
[38:12] stuff that's not even true
[38:16] guess what I heard that when sister
[38:19] Teresa raises her hands up in the air in
[38:21] church that she's not actually praising
[38:23] God for reals nah yeah for reals and
[38:27] which is Prince she's not actually doing
[38:29] it with her heart
[38:31] like for reals I'm just telling you the
[38:35] truth
[38:35] I can't wait to tell my friends that's
[38:39] good that's good I just I don't want you
[38:41] to end up like her okay
[38:43] so you're gonna go okay just try not to
[38:46] be like her
[38:47] now brother Pierre doesn't understand
[38:49] why he's doing this why is he talking
[38:51] bad about the sister why is his life
[38:54] like this but the truth is he actually
[38:56] does know why you know what it is
[38:59] is
[39:01] he doesn't want to surrender his life to
[39:04] God because he's scared he's scared that
[39:06] he won't be able to please God perfectly
[39:09] he's scared that he's gonna fail again
[39:11] just like the devil has been reminding
[39:13] him
[39:14] now later on sister Teresa notices that
[39:18] her brother is struggling and decides
[39:21] that she's gonna offer help
[39:23] the Holy Spirit talked to her to do this
[39:25] you know
[39:26] Hey Brother fear of noticing
[39:31] you've no you can go back to your home I
[39:33] don't need any help you could do your
[39:34] business I can do mine okay
[39:40] just like he's always been struggling
[39:43] with brother peers Pride took over him
[39:46] and made him think that the sister was
[39:48] trying to make him look little and
[39:49] embarrass him so he rejected any helping
[39:51] hand that came his way
[39:54] but later on during that night he
[39:57] started realizing that he couldn't do
[39:59] this on his own anymore
[40:01] that he really wasn't strong enough and
[40:04] that he truly needed God
[40:06] so then while crying out to God he
[40:09] decides to call sister Teresa in hopes
[40:11] that she still felt compassion towards
[40:13] him
[40:26] [Music]
[40:32] Just Dance
[40:40] the devil's trying to work his way right
[40:42] now
[40:44] hello
[40:45] hello brother here
[40:48] hello says Theresa
[40:52] how do you feel
[40:54] well I'm okay I guess actually no I'm
[40:57] not doing so well what's wrong would you
[41:00] like to talk about it I just wanted to
[41:02] say sorry for speaking so harsh to you
[41:04] earlier
[41:05] oh no it's okay don't worry about it I
[41:08] understand no you don't
[41:11] I've been so jealous of you and I
[41:17] and as well that
[41:20] you you just have a perfect life and
[41:23] last time we talk that felt humiliated
[41:25] and
[41:26] also when last time we talked it was
[41:29] also like I felt like you were trying to
[41:31] make me feel small and well
[41:34] your life is just so perfect and I wish
[41:37] that I could have the life but I don't
[41:41] oh brother don't think that way I have
[41:43] bad times and struggles too I'm fighting
[41:47] every minute I can understand why you're
[41:49] why you get discouraged we ourselves are
[41:52] our worst enemy you know really I never
[41:55] knew that I thought the devil was our
[41:57] only enemy do you believe you're a child
[42:00] of God
[42:02] um well
[42:03] sometimes I don't feel like one and most
[42:06] of the times I don't think I am one
[42:09] brother it's not about
[42:10] feelings it's about believing
[42:15] do you have faith your sister there you
[42:18] go that's all you need don't let the
[42:20] double trick you into staying as a
[42:23] prisoner to this flesh don't fall into
[42:25] your negative thoughts
[42:32] you choose sister Teresa yes this mine
[42:36] is where the greatest
[42:37] battle has ever fought you need to
[42:40] constantly be letting go of ourselves
[42:43] and our flesh so God can take over we
[42:45] can't do it in our um
[42:48] you choose it's Teresa may I ask you
[42:51] something sure can you come over to my
[42:54] house and and pray for me so that I may
[42:58] so that it may be delivered from this
[43:00] selfish desire
[43:02] sure
[43:03] so then after the phone call sister
[43:05] Teresa gave him words of life
[43:08] and so they got together and prayed that
[43:10] night
[43:13] brother Pierre finally decided to
[43:15] surrender to God and he was finally
[43:17] delivered with the help of God he was
[43:21] able to let go of all of his selfish
[43:23] Ambitions desires and give back what the
[43:26] devil had given him all of those lies
[43:28] and gods
[43:29] brother Pierre was now fully surrendered
[43:33] to God and he had number one in his life
[43:36] as God
