of their prayers I was able to have a nice little bowl of ciche today so thank you Brothers for your prayers they're not in vain I'm saying they're not in vain amen we serve a living God we serve a God that doesn't do things halfway because I have a miracle at home showing me that God showing me that a God is still working today amen amen amen so I want to give you that greeting from him Amen in this moment if you can please open up to your books of chapter in The Book of Daniel chapter chapter and we're going to be reading right there in verse seven or sorry verse six and seven glor amen and it says like this then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said thus unto him King Darius live forever tell your tell your neighbor assembled together assembled together amen all right it says verse seven all the presidents of the Kingdom the governors and the princes and the counselors and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statue to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or any man for 30 days save of thee Oh King he shall be cast into the dens of lions cap amen all right let us pray now all right beloved God thank you cuz we have a place to come it's you're so simple there's a need you answer it here is our need we have this Temple but it's not these four walls that defy you God it's the life that I live the life of gratitude I live every single day that shows the great God that I serve and I believe there's more than one or two witnesses here tonight that can say that you have been in their lives you have walked with them and you've been with them every single step of the way we thank you be with us tonight some people may be asleep some people but wake us up in this night let us not fall asleep you are the guest of honor and we thank you in this evening in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may be seated I'm gonna try to wake you up let's be honest it's Friday cold and you kind of want to be in somewhere nice and warm and comfortable but tonight we're going to take a different view of of chapter six of Daniel our brother our beloved pastor and our brother blast last week preached about but with our brother VI and brother tonight want to bring it in this angle yeah we're going to call it silencing the critics siling the critics how many want to do that how many want that power cuz it's needed of a great power it's needed of a great power to shut out those voices telling you every single day you ain't nobody you you're you're not going to amount to nothing you you're just a showoff it's just an emotion you're feeling but the Apostle Paul says it right there in Philippians chap 3:3 it says Brethren I count not myself to be a apprehended he said but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind me listen now and reaching forth unto those things which are before and I press towards the Mark Paul all right for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus you got to let things behind you Brothers you got to let the critics behind you cuz if Daniel had paid attention cuz if Daniel had paid attention to those voices to those princes he would have never opened up his windows he would have never ever been able to stand with such Valor such courage to and worshiping God with all of his Hearts cuz I would I rather be criticized to try to do something for God and to be criticized and doing nothing because in this world in this life we're going to be criticized no matter what amen or amen you're going to be criticized whether you do good or bad and often the critics those that criticize other people criticize them and they reveal something that they themselves are lacking the princes and the presidents and I love this had to assemble the devil has to get together because he knows where when when he has to face a child of God oh it ain't nothing easy brothers and sisters I'm a witness to that I am a witness to being criticized I think there's one out there I think there's someone out there that's been criticized we've open been but let us stand like Daniel having a certainty in his heart having a daily fellowship with his God and not caring what the critics had to say because he knew he know that Vengeance are his amen says vengeance are his and I believe Daniel knew that he didn't have to do a big show he knew what he was facing but I want to be more like Daniel tonight face the the enemy head on with certainty inside your heart knowing that you're God's backing you up because we got to believe that guys we have a God that if you stand for him he'll stand for you it's not complicated the scripture says he knows the desires of your heart he knows the desires of your heart he knows you want to do good the scripture says when I want to do good evil is present right but he knows that we're going to be judged we're going to be cried but he knows also that he would never forsake us he will never leave us alone when it seems like it's you're never alone brother I am a witness to that that's why I'm talking the way I'm talking right now I'm not talking something I don't know about I've been there I've been there when you're on the spot like trying to do right but then someone or a little voice and and it's sad to say this but sometimes amongst our own youth are those voices criticizing one another bringing one another down when we shouldn't why should we be embarrassed about talking about our God in a youth Gathering explodes my mind when we want to when someone wants to talk about God oh but someone else is turned off I don't want to talk about that right now we're not in church right now you're just trying to be another fanatic you're just trying to build up to some emotion but let us be like Daniel not caring what they got to say about us siling the voices outside and listening to the voice inside that keeps on saying keep going don't stop I'm here with you I see you son I see you daughter I know you're trying I know what age you're living at I know it's hard to come out of Le but I'm here with you in the midst of the fire I'm there with you come on Brothers brother Bron says if you come expecting you're going to get what you receive it right I'm not trying to be a fanatic I'm not trying to build up to anything our Pastor said it this last service on Wednesday I took that the heart I don't know about you we're sick and tired of word we need the gospel and I'm trying to do that the best I can yes we're going to fail yes we're going to mess up but that doesn't mean we have to stop that's what the devil wants you to do that's what the devil wants you to do he knows if he could stop God's plan in your life he know he can overcome anything else he can take over anything else but let's put a stop to that tonight devil shut up shut up shut your stinking mouth tonight he's talking to you right now brother Gustavo is just an emotion this ain't no different from any other Friday night all right okay God bless you I hope everything goes well for you after this but I think there's people here tonight there's youth tonight that came wanting something they they want something real do you guys want something real I really want it I I don't know about you I don't want to go 25 years wasted of my life sitting on just a nice Pew nice Church what's the point of all of this if the torch if if the torch burns out with us the Next Generation I remember what brother calb said that service on Sunday who's going to be the face of this generation who's going to be the gener face of that generation are you going to be a bystandard are you going to be a bystandard yes someone just criticizing criticizing those that want to make it hindering those that want to try we should be encouraging one another one another not stomping amen it's very simple but we all have to go through through all of that I'm going read this quote from our prophets and it's majority of what I I thought I was going to bring but he says in the message show us the father and it'll satisfy us brother's talking about a picture photo I think it's the picture of the painting without the door knob right bro and brother Bar says every famous pict picture must first go through the Hall of critics oh my before it can be hung in a Hall of Fame and he says and I tell you he's telling me and you that's what the church has done today it went through the critics we are going through our critics amen today we're going through our our fire amen but one day or sorry one of these mornings are you waiting for that morning God's going to hang her in a Hall of Fame out here just sure as the world I'm going jump ahead and he says that's the same church is going to be caught up one of these mornings Daniel went through the Hall of critics Jesus Christ was also criticized in the in the pool of Betha Daniel was also criticized for wanting to take on a giant Moses was criticized for marrying an Ethiopian woman you and I are are nothing EXC we're not an excuse we're our targets but it's up to us and I'm going to close with this there's there's there's no perfect outside of God there's always struggle but it depends on who on you who you want to struggle with wow I don't know about you but I want to struggle alongside my God I want to fight next to my God Amen God bless you the you can accomp me to Daniel 620 bad criticism and positive criticism bad criticism is a demon Daniel 6 verse 20 Le and he came to the den and he cried with a lament a lamentable voice to Daniel and the King spake and Daniel and said to Daniel oh Daniel servant of the Living God is thy God whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the Lions Daniel then Daniel said unto the king oh King live Forever by God hath sent his Angel and hath shut the Lion's mouths they have they have not hurt me for as much as before him in since he has found in me and also before thee Oh King I have done no hurt then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel out of the den So Daniel was taken out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his God Deuteronomy 31 ver6 be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the Lord thy God he is that that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee and that's what we can see in the story of Daniel God never left him God was always with him from the beginning when he was in Babylon when they cast him into the den of the Lions it all started with a lie that's why criticism is a demon a demon doesn't come by himself our brother Gustavo read chapter 6 Daniel chapter 6 verse 7 and it says there all the governors were in agreement but Daniel was not and he was the Mainer so that's how the king fell in the Trap we're talking about silencing the critic but for that to happen you have to have biblical principles and keep with the word of God it's all a process maybe you youth that look like to look into the Bible you may say Daniel was not a young man when he was cast into the lions den maybe he was about 70 years old but his PR his biblical principles was from he was his youth before he was a captive to Babylon perhaps his father took on Fridays to bible study on Fridays to youth you perhaps on Sunday twice and Daniel likeed to search into the scripture he knew what they were talking about perhaps his father did a a service in his home and Daniel received it with all because a Son of God should search the Scriptures Daily to not be deceived perhaps when Daniel came into Babylon you remember Jeremiah's prophecies and Jeremiah would say that they would be captives but the Liberation would come the Deliverance it would come I would like to read Genesis 22:1 17 that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stairs stars of heaven and as the sand which is upon the seash shore and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice so in a moment in his life Daniel at a in a scripture study was looking at the scripture so that fortified him and his faith began to grow why because he had faith if we can study well Daniel could have gone to the per the statue of perect man but he had a disadvantage you you do not you have a great Advantage here because Daniel was in a different age he was not given the Holy Spirit you tonight you can receive the Holy Spirit if you do know how it's an advantage to strengthen your spirit anything that come against you it may not Prevail right the power of the de devil preached in 1955 I love him and I want you to love him I want you to believe him perfect love cast cast out all fear if you love him with the right kind of heart you won't have one Speck of fear whether to keep his word or not night after night standing in the platform before the gross thousands of people around this world critics sitting there saying is that it's this that and the other which doctors sitting there trying to throw spells on you challenge you to duels and things like that never one time I say by the grace of God has one Speck of fear ever hit my heart not one time why he said that he would take care of me and I believe him that's why if I'd be scared I'd run amen but I tell you when Jesus Christ anoints you you're not made with the same running material that's all not the rock of gilbar but the Rock of Ages you climb on the rock of Ages that's God's word and take your position there and stand while the gates of hell is Belling against it and with his perfect assurance that he who promised it not fail will never fail amen that's fa that's when you're not scared from the beginning Daniel had Faith he believed in the prophecies he believed in the word of God God believed he was Abraham's seed why because the seed of serpent is not nothing new the Jews knew the super but when Jesus Christ went to the Pharisees they told him we're sons of Abraham we're not sons of fornication so they had knowledge of the serpent seed it's nothing new it's just restoring the word that was there Genesis Genesis 2278 that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven and that the sand which which is upon the seashore in thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou Hast obeyed my voice thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemies preaching 59 Danel a SE of Abraham was thrown into a fire furnace or no to a lion Zen pardon me Daniel was thrown into a lion Z to be killed by the and the angel of the Lord came that night and stopped the line no doubt it was that great Pillar of Fire that allowed the children of Israel an animal an animal is scared of the light and when the big light stood there the lion laid down and Daniel possessed the Gate of his enemy closed the mouth of the lion because he had God's promise and he was Abraham seed the Hebrew children when they was thrown into a fire furnace they they possessed the gates of the furnace and the Son of God came down and took the fire off of them and they possessed the gates of their enemy and not only did he shut the lion's mouth he shut the mouth of his enemies because he trusted in God he had faith in God he stood for the word but for that to happen when the problem comes to you when the critic criticism comes to you it's important to have what what type of attitude you have what attitude will you have what will you do why because if you take a wrong attitude God cannot support you so Daniel he had a good attitude Fellowship preaching 55 we're going to see what a good attitude is because Daniel SED SED it since he was a young man the word is the word is a seed but the seed won't grow unless you it is placed in the right kind of ground no matter how much seed you got if you're afraid to sew it the seed will do you no good but listen to this every word of God is a seed Jesus said so and every promise of God will come to the pass will come to pass if if you will receive it and don't doubt it can place it in your heart and believe it came from God and water it with faith it will Spring forth of its kind don't ever forget the statement I make this from my heart the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass do you believe that if you'll take the right attitude and that's it's God's word and God is behind his word and the word is God it'll bring to pass what it says if you plant wheat you will get wheat if you plant corn you get if you plant corn you will get corn if you want to be saved accept his Plan of Salvation if you want to be healed accept his plan of healing there there they areu he Christ was wounded for our transgressions and his stripes were we were healed that's all you have to know the next thing you have to believe it it'll take care of itself all of you H Allelujah it will now the attitude of Daniel Every problem that presented itself to himself to him he took it with the right attitude why because he kept the word of God when these critics came to him and deceived the king he simply kept the word of God he didn't have to do anything else all you had to do is believe keep the word of God why because God takes care of the rest you don't have to do anymore young man if someone comes to you with a criticism what will you do what attitude will you have where you have the attitude of the Lord Jesus Christ why they spit on him they did everything to him and the word of God says he did not open his mouth he did not complain he took the right attitude if you and this night take the right attitude every problem that comes to you any criticism that comes God will take care of the rest as long as you keep with the word of God don't move stay going straight uh one night when we were at the other building or other the church a young man came to me said brother uh I would like to talk to you I said that's all right tell me he said one time me and the [Music] youth firstly I would like to ask for for foress I spoke some things about you because sometimes you are very exceedingly in in the order he's my brother and my friend God bless his heart for the honesty and I told him there's no problem brother everything's going to be okay but apart from that what I did is check myself to see if what he was saying was true why because there's good criticism and there's bad criticism you have to discern what type of criticism is coming towards you why because if it's constructive criticism that will bless you it will lift you up why because when God puts you in a problem be of criticism or something else and something come someone comes against you you need to have the right attitude because Danel you knew that God had permitted had allowed everything that had been happening to him and not to hurt him it was for him to rise higher to get another step higher for the attitude that he had would make him grow spiritually it depends how you take things despite being a good ISM check yourself if it's a bad criticism stay still stay with the word of God it's another step grow more you won't see it another way God bless [Applause] you God bless the brothers amen uh you know I heard uh I was doing some studying and uh there was uh something I read that I really liked it said uh you know if if a criticism had any power then uh skunks would be extinct you know because they they get criticized all the time hey man did did did you guys catch that or was it just sorry uh it said if if criticism had any power then skunks would be extinct they they would cease to exist they would no longer exist so so uh that's uh you know and I believe that 100% you know that uh criticism only has the power that that that you give it amen amen uh and uh you know that's just uh that's just one of the things that's inevitable in in in in life it it's something that that we have to go through you know throughout our lives you know the world's going to criticize you you know and even sometimes you get criticized in church amen amen uh you know when uh Daniel was in you know in in this Kingdom they put him as one of the the president you know he was he was one of the ones in charge but even within that Kingdom uh you know there was uh there there was haters you know as a youth service you know and you know there's a lot of haters out there you know they just they just like they like to criticize amen uh you know and and uh you know know sometimes you know they it's like I was telling brother Gustavo sometimes you know they they're they're rooting right there with you they're just you know support you come on brother you got this and they'll support you as long as you're not doing better than they are you know as long as you're as long as you're not doing better than them then they support you as long as you don't sing better than them as long as you don't play the drums better than them you know as long as you're not doing something better than them then then they're on your team but as soon as you start you know standing out a little [Music] bit then all of that begins to change amen it it's it's the truth Brothers you know I remember uh you know one of the first uh when I first came to church uh you know I didn't I didn't quite look like this uh you know I was uh I remember going you know in some uh baggy baggy jeans you know I might had some earrings I don't remember uh but you know I'm just I just thank God that there wasn't anybody there that criticized me for for going to church the way I did uh because I believe that if they would have criticized me at that moment I don't think I'd be standing here before you because uh you know as a young man as a young lady oh you know that's one of the things that probably hurts the most it it it hurts you know I see some of the youth you know some of you walk with walk in here with a heavy heart do you know maybe you got criticized maybe you got criticized the home know because I because I'm going to be honest with you you know even as parents sometimes we have a critical spirit you know and instead of supporting our youth being happy that they're just even sitting here at church all you do is smash them just put them down in all reality you should be thankful to God you should be thankful to God that they're still here they could be out there in the world doing drugs or they could be out there doing things with their friends they could be stealing they could be anywhere else by the grace of God but they're still here amen amen we should be encouraging them you know I I I remember growing up I felt like I got smashed my whole life and you know it was just upset me and we wonder why they're not inspired because they haven't heard the inspired word all they've heard is negativity and you know and you use the word but you use it to condemn them and you tell them how ashamed you are of them and you know what is that supposed to do to somebody what is it supposed to do it definitely doesn't make you want to do more you want to do less you know there was sometimes people that I thought was real close to me now you know when I was younger and uh you know I thought that they were supposed to encourage me through life but all they did they did the exact opposite they just put me down you know and and and you just you just get tired of it but you know the devil the devil's real good at this you see the devil doesn't take Small Things lightly [Music] amen you see the devil knows that in the infancy of something that's the easiest time to kill it but when Jesus came to the Earth but when Moses came to the Earth there was a persecution and you know the reason was because he had heard he he had heard that that somebody that that was a king around there was a king that was coming and you know he wanted to make sure that he killed it before it grew and I believe the devil doesn't change his strategy he's trying to kill the youth he's trying to kill them with criticism as long as they as long as they're young because he knows the potential that that's there and if they can get through that stage that he has something coming to him if if the Youth of voice the true Tabernacle I could overcome the criticism the devil has a force to be reckoned with he's got something coming to him and it's not just one person I believe I don't believe it's just brotherto I don't believe it's just the ministers up here but we all have some sort of potential amen amen I believe that when uh Daniel when Daniel was amongst those people you know amongst amongst the the the the leaders of that Kingdom he uh he was well aware of where he stood amen amen you know this Book of Daniel he this chapter he doesn't talk very much you know when you get criticized and you hear about it you know you're out for blood you know that that that's just the way the human being is you're like oh yeah he's going to get it and you and all of a sudden you have a great memory you're like I got some dirt on him you know I I know what you did you know and you just you just want to get right back at them amen amen but but you notice that a spirit filled man he don't go by his feelings he he don't go by those things because he knows where he's [Music] standing Daniel didn't say a word he he had already won before the trial came Daniel had already overcame because not only did he open those curtains but he opened his heart he opened his heart to God there wasn't nobody that was going to stop him he was on his way amen Amen brother bham says this he says one thing's sure that's God's word that's God's word that God's word will never fail no matter how critical critics might criticize it it says how education might explain it away how they might do this that or the other but it won't stop it one bit it'll happen just the same as John said God's able the stones toise children to [Music] Abraham God's going to do it his words are going to be fulfilled in their season and nothing's going to stop it I'm so glad of that oh how glad I am you see if you're a true son or daughter of God see you got something in you that don't matter what they say about you it doesn't even matter who said it if God didn't say it then it doesn't matter amen amen I don't I don't care who it was because sometimes even as parents we say the wrong things that's why it's so important to have the inspired word the inspired word of God this is not the word of man but this is the word of God know we come here and we preach the gospel that's what we preach here we preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen and you know but sometimes I wonder what gospel we we're listening to because if you're listening to the right gospel it will produce the life of Jesus but you know sometimes we like to hear the gospel of Satan you know what his gospel is you know it's a p pluma you know it's it's all these rappers all this garbage and that's what brings you down that's what makes you not want to walk come on youth I don't act like you know you don't know who he is you know who he is you should know who Jesus is that's who you should know that that gospel ain't going to do a thing for you but it seems like that's what we listen to the most we hear more than than than the than the preachings of brother brandom amen amen we hear it so often because we think we're in love we think you know that we're just it's a big shot now you know that you're something big but you know the devil knows where to play this gospel you know he was he was uh his his his gospel was was was the music in heaven amen that's how that's how he wins the youth over think you know the youth you know I was watching them one time you know there was some music going it was Christian music but they get a little beat going and you know and all of a sudden I started looking down and I saw about 10 or 15 you know their feet just start moving because they you know just the flesh likes that man you know if you're going to dance oh you know you better make sure you dance in the spirit amen better make sure you're dancing for Jesus amen that's what we need amen amen you know I'm closing now Daniel didn't talk a whole lot because he didn't have to you see when when God speaks when God tells a son or daughter of God to speak it's not going to be vain words when God speaks the word you better believe it does something it it'll do something to your heart you see It'll it not only it'll just go straight into the depths of your soul and when his sons or daughters speak it should produce the same thing you know Proverbs 18:21 says this it says death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof what are we speaking what are we talking about what are we doing in the fellowship you see the only time Daniel talked in the whole chapter he talked to testify that that's what he did that's that's all he did I want to read what he said because I believe it's the inspired word amen he says this in Daniel 6:21 he says then said Daniel unto the king oh King live forever my God has sent his Angel and has shut the lion's mouth that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocence he was found in me and also before thee King have I done no hurts you see God stood for him he was testifying that's what we should be doing you're going to say something testify about your God testify about what he's done and confess about what he's going to do because he's not done it's just beginning you know uh when he was in that Den I'm sure all the critics and the people that accused him were laughing they're like man he's he's dead meat that's right he's going to be a a Lon cocktail that's right he's done they probably bought their new suit they're ready to get promoted but Daniel Daniel had prayed Daniel knew who his God was he knew where he stood said God if this is if this is what you want this is where I'll be I'll be here because I believe that you put me you allowed this to happen you allowed this to happen to me and I'm here because I know that you're able to deliver me and the guys put their suit on and they might have went with the King to see what was left of Daniel but when Daniel when they called for Daniel and they heard heard him speak they couldn't say a word everybody they had criticized him everybody that had laughed at him everybody that laughed at the God that he served they couldn't say anything see he not only shut the mouth of the lion but he shut the mouth of the critics shut the mouth of the people that had made fun of them that laughed him because he went to church because maybe he didn't have what the others had but when he came out when Daniel came out of the den God was magnified his influence that he had was greater when he came out of the den then when when he was going in and that's what the god that we serve can do for you he can do it for you young man he can do it for you young lady and even if he didn't and even if he didn't even if he did not do it I'd still rather go out swinging I'll go out swinging as hard as I could but knowing that I gave it my all knowing that I gave it my all everything I could I swung as hard as I could I did what I could Lord sometimes that's all you can do you could just give one more step maybe that step is here at the altar maybe that step is just take to ask somebody for forgiveness maybe that step is to make things right I wish your friend because maybe you've been on the criticizing end but all it takes is one step all it takes for you is to believe I believe that God I can and will deliver if he did it for Daniel he can do it for you I believe it that's the God that I serve that's the God that I live for and that's the God that I die for the altar is open God bless you amen I'm going to ask you to stand this evening it's
