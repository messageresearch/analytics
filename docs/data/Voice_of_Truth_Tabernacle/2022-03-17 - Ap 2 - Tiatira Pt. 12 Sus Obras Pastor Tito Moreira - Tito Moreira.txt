is [Music] here i am [Music] [Music] [Music] what shall we repay is great love [Music] is [Music] [Music] i [Music] oh [Music] [Music] god [Music] is [Applause] [Music] tengo [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] [Applause] [Music] we don't have what it takes [Music] amen [Music] so [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Music] i [Music] chase my heart [Music] may i be like you chase my heart [Music] make it [Music] [Music] [Applause] thank you for doing the effort i know it's not easy to come to church during the week we're working many and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broke into shivers even as i received of my father and i will give him the morning star i want to focus on the first verse we read his works yes [Music] on you will fulfill last week we spoke how god needs says in the message the wedding of the lamb they say the because he says you have nothing to overcome but you have to do something now we understand what we must do what you and i should do is the things we love songs and brother branham says god isn't going to take away until you let them go so that's what we spoke about the greatest enemy i got is william branham is he's the one that gets to a place sometimes when he thinks he can do it and when he does fuera that shoves god right out of the picture but when i can get rid of that guy when i can get to a place that he is out of the way entonces then god can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about it that's when god can use you all that's when god [Music] and we spoke of the things that make up our ego [Music] estrestoria our ego is our story that doesn't about [Music] being right i have i'm right that makes us feel like we're better than the rest of them we know what we're doing and the rest don'ts that's why we gossip and speak about the rest or better about yourself if we accomplish to let go so let go of our ego que yo no now we're going to speak about this he says verse 26 it says see that overcometh and keepeth my works notice it's not saying we must keep our own words but if it is repeat after [Music] i need to make sure what i'm doing are his works not my own but it also lets me know the question that i have to do what he did do now that sounds like something very hard what should we do how can we accomplish to do what he did to do his works how can we accomplish that bueno libra de felipe capitolo dos we'll read philippians this is the way that jesus did what he did this is the way he accomplished what he did on earth and this is the way you and i also accomplished to do his works but in loneliness of mine let each esteem other better than themselves not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others jesus now spanish says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus [Music] jesus forgive me in spanish it says let this feeling but in english it says let this mind correct that's right in english in english it says let this mind and this is actually the right word because everything begins in the mind remember when we spoke about the mind and what the that's where repeat if i accomplish to have the mind of jesus i'll be able to do what he did okay that's why it says jesus let this mind be in here but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of it was made in the likeness of men and being found in a fashion as well he humbled himself that you can keep his works you must have the same mind he did okay now see what brother branham says i'm gonna now let's go back a little on his life and see what he did when he was honest the bible said he made himself of no reputation yeah he was the creator or how many of you have false teeth this but the man who made them first no reputation had no jesus he didn't care [Music] [Music] is he didn't have to impress anyone the man who made an artificial arm made himself a reputation but the man who made your real arm he made it of himself no reputation is that right now he may he was a humble man and here he didn't claim to be anything of within himself it was jesus [Music] you to earth and was not to be made in angels he came down on earth and took the form of a bondsman not an angel in order to pay the penalties the bible said he was made a little little lower than the enemies in order for death that he he was probably a little skinny spinly looking fellow nose didn't look like a king do you notice a handsome man he was a a horrible horrible looking he wasn't there was no beauty to desire nevertheless he did it [Music] many times the people judge people by the way they dress or by the by their statures we man is not judged by how big he is and how strong is his muscles by character and character alone i've seen men that way 200 pounds and didn't have all great vehicles good suits mascaras the most expensive things i'm gonna go back to the second quote jesus and the message seeking after jesus watch the ministry of our lord el norreclamos he didn't he did not claim to be a great person come by the way of a stable door salio por la pena capital went out the way of capital punishment sola owned about one garment in his lifetime [Music] and our wardrobes fall you know he's and my lord jesus maybe only one garment that's the one he had me or jesus my lord jesus that's how he conquered el noli how he looked a jesus no important [Music] if he had the best clothes or if he didn't [Music] he took on himself of knowledge oh but every time god confirms what we want come on [Music] [Applause] [Music] if you don't like that they tell you that you're wrong it's our ego no no we don't like to be told we're wrong we'd like to always be right that's ego that makes us feel like something better than that because i'm right strip yourselves before god unless you will trying to do something within yourselves i hope that gets down deep to us both here in the tape world [Music] we we know it doesn't matter [Applause] we're there for a while uh i only want your will you've got to get to a place that you know you're nothing and don't never rise above it for as soon as you ride you rise above god you've got to keep yourself up and on the foreign [Music] if [Applause] [Music] come on you've got to keep yourself off your high horses and that's forever here and in the tape world going around can anyone say there's demons in my life [Music] there are demons of the devil under the name of christianity teaching the doctrine the commandments of men theological seminary doctrines hallelujah who's able to but who's stronger watch what he says here quebec that make us do everything we do [Music] denomination is able to conquer nominations walking up and down through these tombstones cry in the days of miracles we don't there were no miracles but after brother branham's time seminar there was many miracles so now maybe you don't hear the time of miracles but maybe you do hear you can't come out of [Music] they them [Music] the holy ghost your ego [Music] [Applause] take that away from me desires we have [Music] and seen right at the weakest moment jesus speaking about jesus and there jesus has stood against the evil he had the right [Music] to be surrounded with good things to have good things [Music] but jesus preserved himself [Music] is and jesus is [Music] [Music] but then from there god begins to raise him up please stand [Music] what should you and i do [Music] let go of our ego [Music] lord [Music] [Music] i [Music] how many times lord have i spoken things with me because i don't want people to think less of it how many times critical have i criticized [Music] because i want yo so feel better than the rest what does this is how many times without knowing it's leading me to my death lord [Music] remove every wrong desire from me lord we move [Music] [Music] i don't know anything [Music] do your works [Music] may we do lord [Music] may we know that without you we aren't anything we are dust [Music] i don't want to have anything you don't want me to have [Music] [Music] in my life [Music] that isn't for [Music] to be for you lord [Music] is always hindering you [Music] lord forgive us [Music] that they don't [Music] [Music] against you lord [Music]
