[Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] God will give it to you it's an honor and a privilege to be before sharing the word of the Lord foreign dead in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen Ephesians chapter 1 11. in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will find Cristo that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ verse 12. second Timothy chapter 1 verse 8 and 9. foreign nor of him his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God pay attention to verse 9. who has saved us and called us within holy calling who called us dios and he called us with a purpose but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus pay attention to the last part before the world began you may be serious Brothers they got our blessings to his word um we're in the title a purpose and a vision a theme all right so for this morning as well as brother Alex we're not a coincidence no no God has brought you to this day with a purpose so now is it why that people many times they think or believe and act as if though it was only a coincidence I I think I look at them and think when we act like as if there were a coincidence a um because we don't want to surrender or give accounts to anybody look Brothers the greatest minds of humanity in the world actually the biggest Theory there is that is that we come from a coincidence [Music] that has everything it does everything with a purpose so I asked myself has a purpose even your name in influencia has an influence sit on you know the names that our parents have an influence on us foreign Richard means rats we don't want any rats here right so everything in God there is no coincidence nothing happened by a coincidence nothing God had the delicacy to put you in a certain position or place sooner or later you know when Jesus Christ came to this world and he came to a small city of Bethlehem why did he get to Bethlehem porque why because it also has a significance why did he get to a bigger city so that he wouldn't suffer so much and sometimes we ask why are we born Mexicans oh why are we born why are we born this way our inheritance is this everything has a purpose why was I born in my family wow for Kim we Spanish foreign [Applause] they think that they have the right to do whatever they want when you do that you're not living with a purpose you're just living by a coincidence whatever comes to your mind is in the message God's gifts always find their places you know coincidence will always take you to something living as you want will always take you to something and what we'll take you is to rebelliousness we'll take it to uh rebelliousness to your um right Gia ruin this is in this paragraph 79. he went to New York this is [Music] a few weeks ago I went down I don't know the name of the place down there in New York where they just got city blocks of bitniks where it says that they're a youth of the rebellious okay this is now then grows down there with uh legal Tarts on and nothing on one of those little bikinis as they call it over the top of that because he says they do anything that's on their minds no matter what it is they can do just anything and they want to lay down don't get up yes just lay down and not get up if they want to go do a certain thing they do it if not they don't just traveling in their own minds and what does the unconverted mind come to wow where does the mind go to there's no purpose something yourself no one else can force you yes appointed with the gun to come to church today we're like you know right nobody was because we want something better yes well when the Lord Jesus Christ was born in this world he was born in the worst place that you could yourself imagine but there wasn't even much people there was animals there was a filthiness but he chose to be born there with a purpose the three the three wise men yeah got there came with three gifts amen amen those three gifts was gold significantly that which means deity the incense significance which means service that means bitterness or death oh to death that's right that has to be the purpose I can't be like Jesus Christ [Music] it's a lot to ask to be like Jesus Christ I want to tell you this morning that it is possible to be like Jesus Christ many times we see Jesus Christ as the father I don't know Jesus Christ is our brother our older brother as our older brothers he came to put an example for us just like I did I want you to do it as well that lights up our purpose Siempre always when the Lord Jesus Christ that John had been oppressed then he began his ministry Jesus Jesus doesn't go Jesus Christ Jesus Christ doesn't impose something Jesus Christ is always waiting time his time and his place even though we're not ready amen locations everything in the Lord Jesus Christ everything everything even when he took out the belts and began to give some good ones to everybody how is it that he called his disciples that was not a coincidence it had a purpose it has a purpose where did he called him from and all the the man that God calls they had always been always yes they were already working that's right foreign [Music] Brothers from other two people I have brought blessing for yourself it's okay it's okay [Music] but God wants us to bless others everything that we do is foreign have we heard or do we live everything to to the coincidence or let life take take its course Thomas significa means twin this is this is Jesus it says it seems that Thomas looked a lot like Jesus no Brothers I would like to to be like Jesus none of his appearance not his appearance no um physical appearance but in everything else I would like to be like Jesus means the son of taomai we're sons of somebody no we're not sons of coincidence we're sons of someone now John it means manly or masculine so in other words a hard worker what have you done for your brother or sister Pedro Peter Piedra stone that means yeah we need Revelation Santiago planta the one that supplants you know there's two significa okay okay there's two things there's someone that's a plants yes that is for good yeah and that's something that is for bad there's something in us to get rid of a power gift of God Judas Iscariot and uh Judas tadius means praised foreign whoever wants to conduct an orchestra must turn their back to the crowd um to direct the orchestra and everybody to see us no no no no no no he that directs the orchestra will never give his face to the audience no we're not a coincidence let us read first Ephesians but we are his work mentions created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them [Music] many generations back so that you could be here tonight this morning did you know that think about it that you at one time he says I'll repeat this again you at one time was in your father in the gene of your father now he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him but you see usted and then you became a person expressed in the image like your father like your father that is where the fellowship then there's the fellowship we need to enter into the fellowship with a purpose we need to this is who needs life this morning no brothers they need us we need them you know a good purpose and to understand the vision gives you a mission a mission a purpose that you have to fulfill God bless you foreign Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing I'll ask you a question in this morning with joy with happiness that God is with you because on verse 3 and now this is where we want to focus on this is that the Lord he is a center of all things recognize that the Lord the first thing that we have to do in our lives to First find our purpose is that God is the center of all things it continues to say knowing ye that the Lord he is it is he that has made us and not we ourselves the second point in which I'd like to tell you in this morning you did not create yourself according to the words and not we ourselves is of our actions we don't want we don't we don't have someone to tell us what to do no no no no no we don't seek advice we don't seek guidance Vision in which who I am in this life the person is foreign you're a coincidence you're here in this life with a purpose amen [Music] look there's people that live their life and all they think everything is is a coincidence everything they think is just luck I don't believe in karma if you follow the statues the statues of God and everything's gonna be fine now I want to remind you in this morning maybe someone said to you you were an accident when you were born why I want to say it is maybe for a parent it wasn't their plan for you to come to this world he is waiting for you he was waiting for you to be born that's right circumstances because the plans of God doesn't have to do with the circumstances in which we're living in the city now you may step into the city you could say I came from the world the pastor will be my oh my God foreign foreign that was gone here my life would be different a young man if I was six feet tall the ladies will pay attention to me they can't accept themselves because God created me hey man [Music] um I've seen people do you know you know that attraction the real attractions that's what makes them attractive oh my um amen are you with me this morning say to your neighbor Hood if it's a man or a woman don't say nothing but if it's a break for you to a brother say to them you are beautiful Brothers you are beautiful Church even though this is [Applause] n't everything around you is foreign [Applause] you sent it to me to your grace he know he knew your habits and Super Shoes you know your weaknesses you know that we were going to have bad habits sometimes people without purpose oh El Super savitos you know your habits everything reference you're not a coincidence God brought you here God bless you here so you can recognize who you are yeah and then when he looked all over the creek as it was I Choose You I Choose You and when he did that before there was a speck of life [Music] then you're Eternal then you're you're Eternal with God you're not a coincidence I'm going to give a little Revelation on that salmoches salty is my favorite song my birthday is uh June 30th thank you when I see you your Heavens like Heavens the work of thy fingers [Music] for what what did God create all that foreign it's for you who are we how this is the value of ourselves right here with the purpose amen ities and the son of man that thou visits him for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with the glory and honor so you're not a question God has chosen it with a purpose in the message um I know my redeemer lives preached in 1958 these implantation now we want to draw this first into our mind is that there is not one thing that can destroy us until the purpose of he who created us has been fulfilled we are made for a purpose esta Iglesia this church was built here for a purpose for a purpose foreign and the roof and the interior was not put here just to see if it could be done it was put here by a purpose it was put here by a purpose or for a purpose if I was created with a purpose and if you you take something with you now take this with you if I was born with a purpose that all the resources in which I need have to be placed for that purpose the house in which Northwest your home that you live in was not just accidentally put there you know so this is your home was made for a purpose to serve a purpose is if you did drive this morning here in your automobile the automobile was not just made just to see if it could be made the material was not wasted by man it

everything that you got everything that's part of you suvida your life that you have everything we have is for the glory of God I remember my father never had a brand new car until they gave him for many years to go to church [Music] and I was going to say oh man they're going to hear that old crusty car he said God gave it to me why not in this morning they located what God put in our hands to
