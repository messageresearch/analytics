[30:48] it's a power
[31:30] and how
[31:58] that is
[32:00] on seduction or seducing hacies
[32:04] that's how he control he gets to control
[32:06] us
[32:08] he seduces us
[32:09] [Music]
[32:11] the devil controls me
[32:28] influence
[32:29] you have the influence that she had
[32:35] and then she controlled the people of
[32:36] israel
[32:39] through the power of seduction
[32:43] she was she could seduce the people she
[32:45] had to be able to seduce the people
[32:49] through fornication
[32:52] everything she was doing
[33:33] [Music]
[33:49] the way she feels
[34:18] as long as he can seduce
[34:46] is not based
[34:59] god obtains over his

[36:09] will be able to obtain or have
[36:21] it's a true power
[36:38] a
[37:02] that even the most desperate enemy will
[37:04] be broken if need be
[37:13] his demonstration of rule by power will
[37:15] be like unto the very sons
[37:18] the son of god
[37:33] yes

[38:37] [Music]
[38:43] it doesn't need uh seduction
[39:20] [Applause]
[39:48] [Music]
[40:34] [Music]
[40:35] yes sir thank you god
[40:49] this is the first thing i'll give you
[40:59] verse 28 says and i will give him the
[41:01] morning star
[41:03] two things
[41:18] i'm going to read what brother branham
[41:20] says
[41:22] in the church ages book
[41:25] uh
[41:53] it says until the day dawn of the the
[41:55] day star arises in your heart
[41:59] second peter 1 19.
[42:19] the spirit is making a promise to to the
[42:21] the people of the dark ages
[42:25] relating to himself
[42:42] is
[42:53] [Music]
[42:57] even lucifer satan himself
[43:00] we know the book of isaiah
[43:04] calls him the star of the morning
[43:08] the star of the morning
[43:09] tambien
[43:25] of the morning uh
[43:28] they were appraising or worshiping god
[43:30] cuando diosponia los fundamentos de la
[43:32] tierra when he laid the foundations of
[43:33] the earth
[43:40] so we see that that term the morning
[43:41] star is not only used for our lord jesus
[43:46] but one thing that is very different
[43:50] is that
[43:51] an apocalypse that in the book of
[43:53] revelation
[43:57] he says i'm the ruling offspring of
[43:59] david
[44:02] this is the bright and morning star in
[44:04] england in english it says
[44:35] el diablo and the devil
[44:38] appears to
[44:40] be as a lion
[44:43] trying to devour
[44:50] so he tries to attribute the same
[44:51] characteristics that god has el trata de
[44:54] tener los amiens he tries to have them
[44:56] as well el mundo the world
[45:00] the world and his power
[45:44] in the morning or in the beginning
[45:56] he is the the brightest morning star
[46:04] the scientists have a certain way to
[46:05] describe it
[46:09] but i'm going to focus on what brother
[46:10] branham has to say about it
[46:12] because
[46:27] before the sun arises
[46:35] in the thai and church age they say
[46:38] las cosas
[46:42] he says the things of god were to the
[46:44] lowest point at that time
[46:50] and it appeared that satan was going to
[46:52] conquer the people of god
[47:06] it says if ever a people needed a
[47:08] promise embracing the land where there
[47:09] is no night it was the people of the
[47:11] dark ages
[47:17] and that is why the spirit is promising
[47:19] them the morning star el es estadi
[47:21] siendo que la estrella
[47:45] he will not be using the stars or
[47:47] messengers to give light in the dirt
[47:53] any longer it will be jesus himself
[47:54] speaking to them face to face as he
[47:56] shares his kingdom with them
[48:01] it is the morning star that is visible
[48:02] when the light of the sun commences to
[48:04] shine
[48:27] the light of the world will become
[48:28] brighter and brighter in our perfect day
[49:00] a dark time in our
[50:09] if you are able this a cersei to do away
[50:15] with your old self
[50:18] the suego of your ego
[50:20] us
[50:22] you are giving a rumor space
[50:39] as long as the old old man leaves the
[50:42] older self leaves
[50:44] but that person
[50:47] they can let go of their ego
[50:50] let go of their desires
[51:19] let me tell you
[51:42] [Music]
[51:48] that's the real
[51:57] come to our lives
[52:16] the one i love
[52:23] everything i've created in these 38
[52:25] years oh let's take my hand them all
[52:27] this image of myself
[52:58] and take its
[53:11] and if you notice the very teaching of
[53:12] nature this
[53:14] nature if you want to see god
[53:17] god is in his great nature
[53:20] and god is great
[53:24] of a morning
[53:29] i believe it was the prophet isaiah one
[53:31] time
[53:33] he said washington what are the nights
[53:35] he said
[53:38] the night cometh in the morning this is
[53:53] always before the
[53:55] daylight it's the darkness
[53:58] for god is about to make a change
[54:04] to come to our lives
[54:36] the
[55:13] [Music]
[55:16] god allows darkness in our lives
[55:30] is
