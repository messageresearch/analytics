[22:13] this man his superpower right now will
[22:17] know it
[22:18] he believed he had faith in god
[22:22] and that was his superpower do you can
[22:24] guess who it was
[22:26] who was it faithy that's right
[22:29] it was abraham
[22:35] but we forget also don't forget sarah
[22:38] also
[22:42] [Music]
[22:43] ten years later
[23:03] sarah sarah i i i i just i just spoke to
[23:07] god

[23:37] insane
[23:43] and like i said boys and girls abraham's
[23:46] superpower
[23:47] was having faith in god and in his
[23:50] promise
[23:52] and as we know as the story goes god did
[23:56] something supernatural in
[23:59] abraham and sarah to bring forth that
[24:02] promise
[24:19] sarah your your hair it's it's it's not

[25:04] boys and girls god's superpower

[25:10] we know
[25:11] later on after like we said abraham
[25:14] keeping the faith
[25:15] and it took a lot of strength to believe
[25:18] that it took what
[25:19] to believe 25 years after that broad
[25:22] promised him he would have a son
[25:24] but he still believed and it takes a lot
[25:27] of power to believe
[25:28] you know something that seems impossible
[25:31] but god makes the impossible
[25:34] impossible possible amen now
[25:37] we got one more all right well let's see
[25:42] give me one second i can't see as i used
[25:44] to
[25:46] okay well this young fellow
[25:49] as we know him he was young
[25:52] you know he was the very last one the
[25:55] very small child you know
[25:57] many times they forgot about him but
[26:00] it's the ones that seem insignificant
[26:03] the ones that
[26:04] you may not think twice about that god
[26:06] loves to use
[26:07] the smallest ones you want to know who
[26:09] that was
[26:11] it was david david and he pleased god to
[26:16] use david
[26:20] david oh david
[26:24] one second we're having technical
[26:26] difficulties
[26:27] oh oh well oh so we're gonna turn off
[26:31] the lights real quick light lady thank
[26:33] you
[26:34] and then like i was saying david having
[26:37] the superpowers
[26:39] and believing in god that no matter what
[26:42] he was faced with
[26:44] he was able to endure all things
[26:50] and as it came to be like i said david
[26:53] being the youngest
[26:54] you know he was it says the word of god
[26:56] said that he was a man
[26:58] according to the heart of god believing
[27:01] that anything that he would face
[27:03] anything that would come into his life
[27:05] he would be able to do it with the help
[27:07] of god
[27:08] and one day he was faced with a great
[27:11] tremendous goliath
[27:24] [Music]
[27:32] i came here to defeat you in the name of
[27:34] the lord
[27:35] and i will feed your corpse to the birds
[27:37] of the sky
[27:38] and the beasts of the lands
[27:41] and david believing that the lord had
[27:44] promised him
[27:44] and he rather sling and slew
[27:52] showing his superpower
[27:55] [Applause]
[27:58] any crabs goliath sword and slayed
[28:02] the great giants lights off life's not
[28:05] too gruesome too gruesome
[28:09] again god showing his superpower
[28:12] you know david's who was a man according
[28:15] to the heart of
[28:16] god amen believing not doubting
[28:19] believing that god was with him no
[28:21] matter what
[28:22] and now now
[28:26] after a while now we've been talking
[28:28] about great men of god but god
[28:30] also used women amen and when we believe
[28:33] god used women as well
[28:35] women that also had great superpowers
[28:38] you know and now we're going to present
[28:40] one of many
[28:42] great women in the bible who is mary
[28:45] mary the mother of jesus who
[28:49] also had a great superpower
[29:12] and mary being the mother at the age of
[29:16] 14
[29:17] or almost to be a mother just doing her
[29:20] daily things but believing
[29:22] that whatever came to pass would happen
[29:25] when the angel of the lord came to her
[29:30] angel of the lord
[29:44] mary mary it is i the angel the lord
[29:48] fear not mary for thou hast found favor
[29:51] with god
[29:52] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[29:55] womb
[29:56] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[29:59] name
[30:00] jesus the hell might this happen having
[30:03] known that i
[30:04] do not know man mary
[30:07] just believe believe
[30:11] okay i believe lord i believe
[30:15] and that was mary's superpower believing
[30:18] that despite
[30:19] not knowing a man she would conceive a
[30:22] son
[30:23] in whom his name is jesus
[30:27] amen
[30:33] it's okay baby jesus it's okay here he
[30:36] is the savior of the year
[30:40] and as we know many times it takes a lot
[30:42] of strength
[30:43] to believe you know believe things that
[30:46] may
[30:47] seem impossible but god like i said
[30:50] makes the impossible possible
[30:53] and as we know now we come to the
[30:55] greatest moment the greatest superhero
[30:58] of all times you guys want to know who
[31:01] that is

[32:07] just like david did with goliath and in
[32:10] one of those moments
