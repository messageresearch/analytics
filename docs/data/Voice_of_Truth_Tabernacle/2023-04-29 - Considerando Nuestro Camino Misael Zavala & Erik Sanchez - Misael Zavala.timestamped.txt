[7:00] Who I Am The Glitch
[8:18] how could David take uriah's wife the
[8:21] beautiful Bathsheba when he had 500
[8:23] wives 500 of his own
[8:29] implemented
[8:31] but seeing her taking a bath and there's
[8:34] the negligence now she just got she just
[8:36] forgot to pull the shades down when she
[8:38] was taking her bath system
[8:44] and know that know that King made a trip
[8:48] by there every day down over that wall
[8:51] now we are seeing okay
[8:58] she knew that David David
[9:00] would have strolled around that area
[9:05] the word negligence
[9:11] of her own self
[9:14] but she also knew
[9:16] that the king could see her
[9:23] he took her
[9:25] this is
[9:29] the word of God says when she told him
[9:31] that she that she was impregnated
[9:35] it seems as though he wanted to kind of
[9:37] wash his hands
[9:42] and we don't recognize
[9:46] sin after sin continues to happen
[9:50] one thing brings another and thus
[9:57] the Bible says that he is sent for Uriah
[10:03] and he tried to persuade Uriah
[10:06] to go back home
[10:09] and go asleep with his wife
[10:14] so that it would appear that it was
[10:16] uriah's child
[10:19] but Uriah did not to take heed or pay
[10:22] attention to the king
[10:25] so the king formed a he uh he
[10:28] constructed a plan
[10:29] on how to get rid of Uriah
[10:33] [Music]
[10:34] that's how far his sin took him
[10:39] because him being according to the heart
[10:42] of God
[10:44] he was also of Flesh
[10:47] he also failed and made mistakes
[10:51] but God knew David's heart
[10:58] who was Uriah Urias
[11:03] Uriah was of the people of the Hittites
[11:06] Caribbean and Israel that dwelled in
[11:09] Israel
[11:11] they were in Canaan Dios
[11:16] te Pueblo God had sent to kill these
[11:18] people
[11:21] completely in the time of Joshua Josue
[11:28] but Joshua left us some of the tribes of
[11:31] the hittite and others he didn't
[11:33] completely obey God
[11:36] so the descendants of Uriah Israel they
[11:40] they stayed in
[11:43] israelitas and with time they became
[11:46] Israelites they believed in the same God
[11:50] and Uriah was faithful to God
[11:53] he worshiped the Lord as well
[11:57] now
[12:01] is
[12:04] second Samuel 11 14 and 15. this is
[12:13] 14 says and it came to pass in the
[12:15] morning that David wrote a letter to
[12:17] joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah
[12:19] yes
[12:27] and he wrote in the letter saying said
[12:29] ye Uriah in the Forefront of the hottest
[12:32] battle and retiree from him that he may
[12:34] be smitten and die
[12:38] now Not only was it just adultery
[12:42] but it was also a homicide
[12:45] because it was not a righteous a fight
[12:49] it's like I say
[12:53] one sin leads to another if you don't
[12:56] come out of it
[12:57] aura
[13:01] now David was becoming a murderer
[13:05] this is
[13:07] second Samuel 11 verse 26 says
[13:11] after Uriah had had died in the Battle
[13:20] and when the wife of Uriah heard that
[13:22] Uriah her husband was dead she mourned
[13:25] for her husband
[13:30] is
[13:41] and when the morning was passed David
[13:44] sent investor to his house and she
[13:46] became his wife and bear him a son but
[13:48] the thing that David had done displeased
[13:50] the Lord
[13:53] now in order for it to displease the
[13:55] Lord
[13:57] we don't need to just be adulterers
[14:02] any sin displeases
[14:07] because the sin doesn't doesn't have a
[14:10] great sinner a small sin this is
[14:17] nor the liar will be saved
[14:21] it doesn't put one higher than the
[14:23] others
[14:24] Sin is Sin now
[14:31] cuando cuando Senor West when the Lord
[14:35] sees this
[14:37] since his Prophet Nathan
[14:40] to go and and seek out David yes
[14:44] II Samuel don't say uno chapter 12 verse
[14:48] 1
[14:50] all the way to 14. this is
[14:54] and the Lord sent Nathan unto
[14:57] Davido
[15:03] and he came into him and said unto him
[15:05] there was were two men in one city the
[15:08] one rich and the other
[15:10] poorjas
[15:17] is
[15:25] the rich man had many flocks and herds
[15:27] but the poor man had nothing say one
[15:29] little you left which he had bought and
[15:31] nourished up and it grew up together
[15:33] with him and with his children he did
[15:35] eat of his own meat and drink of his own
[15:36] cup and lay in his bosom and was unto
[15:38] him as a daughter yes
[15:54] traveled unto the rich man and he spared
[15:56] to take of his own flock and of his own
[15:59] herd to dress for the wayfaring man that
[16:01] was come unto him but took the poor
[16:04] man's lamb and dressed it for the man
[16:05] that was come to him
[16:15] and David's anger was greatly kindled
[16:17] against the man and he said to Nathan as
[16:20] the Lord liveth the man that has done
[16:21] this thing shall surely die
[16:27] and he shall restore the lamb fourfold
[16:30] because he did this thing and because he
[16:31] had no pity
[16:34] is
[16:41] and Nathan said to David Thou Art the
[16:44] man thus said the Lord God of Israel I
[16:46] Anointed The King over Israel and I
[16:48] delivered thee out of the hand of Saul
[16:54] is
[17:01] and I gave thee that Master's house and
[17:03] thy Masters wives into thy bosom and
[17:06] gave you the house of Israel and of
[17:07] Judah and if that had been too little I
[17:09] would moreover have given unto thee such
[17:11] and such things
[17:23] wherefore has not despised the
[17:25] Commandment of the Lord to do evil in
[17:27] his sight that was killed Uriah the
[17:28] hittite with a sword and has taken his
[17:30] wife to be thy wife and has slain him
[17:33] with the sword of the children of Amen
[17:42] now therefore the sword shall never
[17:44] depart from thine house because thou has
[17:46] despised me and has taken the wife of
[17:48] Uriah the hittite to be thy wife
[17:53] David
[17:58] o
[18:01] and David said unto Nathan I have sinned
[18:03] against the Lord and Nathan said unto
[18:05] David the Lord also hath put away thy
[18:07] sin Thou shalt not die
[18:12] Amigos
[18:18] because by this deed thou has given
[18:20] great occasion to the enemies of the
[18:22] Lord to blaspheme the child also that is
[18:24] born unto thee shall surely die
[18:28] it's like Historia this uh this story
[18:33] David only knew it
[18:35] Bathsheba as well
[18:38] and the Commandment of the art the
[18:41] commander of the army Pennsylvania
[18:43] David knew thought that he was safe
[18:47] that he could keep it uh hidden yeah
[18:51] and sometimes you that's how we are
[19:16] and the more we make mistakes we commit
[19:19] we continue to make mistakes that's what
[19:22] happened with David
[19:26] he took the word of God very lightly
[19:35] he didn't realize what he was doing
[19:40] but he was sent a prophet
[19:44] and in this age we are sent a prophet in
[19:48] order to tell us
[19:50] where we are wrong
[19:53] what we are doing wrong
[19:55] whether it be great or small
[19:58] as I said as I said there's no greater
[20:02] before the eyes of God it's just it's
[20:06] all sin
[20:09] now
[20:15] knowing that just these three are knew
[20:18] of this story
[20:20] verse 14.
[20:28] how about because
[20:30] by this deed thou has given dedication
[20:32] to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme
[20:34] the child also that is born unto thee
[20:35] shall surely die
[20:37] which enemies
[20:39] but there were many
[20:48] when David Fell
[20:55] I want to read on verse 4 a little bit
[20:59] this is one of the causes by which David
[21:01] is
[21:02] he was distracted
[21:05] he was relaxed and comfortable in his
[21:08] Palace
[21:12] and there came a traveler unto the rich
[21:14] man
[21:16] yes
[21:18] this is another another character here
[21:22] it says that he was a traveler here
[21:25] one that was walking toward
[21:29] Davido who was the one that was walking
[21:32] it's a spirit
[21:41] which took him to the act of adultery
[21:45] but a a walker
[21:50] in either of the lives
[21:53] it could be any a bad spirit because
[21:55] that would come to you and you feed it
[21:59] with your Deeds
[22:02] you feed those Spirits
[22:05] that's what verse 4 is referring to
[22:13] the messenger says in in the in the
[22:16] message the the message of Grace in 61.
[22:22] now that was David's passions
[22:25] he had 500 wives
[22:37] instead of taking one of his 500 wives
[22:39] to appease or satisfy his passions he
[22:41] went and took this other man's wife then
[22:43] killed Uriah when she became a mother
[22:46] Mercy
[23:57] bring him to the courts
[24:00] we could give him one more opportunity
[24:03] but when he found himself lost
[24:07] he immediately asked for mercy
[24:14] since he was a man according to God's
[24:17] heart
[24:19] he acknowledged
[24:22] he recognizes his fault in Los Angeles
[24:26] in Psalms 51
[24:42] according to the multitude really I
[24:44] Tender Mercies brought out my
[24:45] transgression
[24:50] watch me thoroughly from my iniquity and
[24:53] cleanse me from my sins
[24:58] for I acknowledge my transgressions and
[25:00] my sin is ever before me
[25:10] against the the only have I sinned and
[25:13] done this evil in thy sight that thou
[25:15] might as be justified when thou speakest
[25:17] and be clear when thou judges
[25:23] behold I was shaping an iniquity and in
[25:26] sin did my mother conceived me yeah
[25:32] behold thou desire is truth in the
[25:34] inward parts and in the hidden part Thou
[25:36] shalt make me to know wisdom
[25:38] now David is recognizing
[25:42] that he had sinned
[25:47] she exposed herself
[25:51] he should have remained firm in the word
[25:53] of God
[25:55] and youth sometimes in our short in our
[25:58] young age
[26:00] you have I mean this is
[26:03] sometimes you think
[26:06] if my if my father weren't like this
[26:10] if my mother wasn't like this
[26:24] as long as you don't recognize your sins
[26:28] as long as you don't recognize your
[26:30] faults
[26:32] you will be in the same condition
[26:34] doesn't matter who your father is
[26:41] the best preachers
[26:43] if you don't recognize that you're wrong
[26:54] that we were born
[26:58] to work with his flesh
[27:02] but the message of the hour came you
[27:04] know
[27:06] the perfect man
[27:09] you can't do away
[27:14] you weren't allowed to do anything
[27:17] but let's recognize
[27:19] our condition God bless you
[27:23] [Applause]
[27:29] God bless you Brothers
[27:33] it's a privilege to be able to greet you
[27:34] it's the
[27:36] um
[27:37] we thank God as well
[27:41] for this precious day what is
[27:44] time
[27:46] we greet our brother Tito California in
[27:50] California
[27:53] hoping that the day of tomorrow all goes
[27:57] well
[28:00] and have some great news
[28:03] we uh missed them already yesterday
[28:20] let us open our Bibles
[28:23] The Book of Proverbs chapter four
[28:29] and we'll be reading from verse 25
[28:32] through 27.
[28:41] verse 25 26-27.
[28:51] the word of the Lord says like this
[28:56] is
[28:59] look right on and let thine eyelids look
[29:02] straight before thee examine
[29:07] Ponder the path of thy feet and let all
[29:10] thy ways be established
[29:14] turn not to the right hand or to the
[29:17] left remove thy foot from Evil
[29:22] now let us go to a second Samuel ah
[29:35] and we'll be staying there and then
[29:38] we'll be reading in the same chapter
[29:56] and it came to pass in an evening tide
[29:59] that David arose from off his bed and
[30:01] walked upon the roof of the King's house
[30:03] and from the roof he saw a woman washing
[30:05] herself and the woman is very beautiful
[30:06] to look upon okay
[30:09] may God add blessings to the reading of
[30:11] his words
[30:15] of biblical characters
[30:18] we are with David
[30:21] we'll be learning on Bathsheba
[30:24] and Uriah
[30:46] or open up with this
[30:48] instructions about the distractions
[30:51] what is a distraction
[31:05] and provokes a lack of attention
[31:09] that is
[31:17] that is
[31:22] in these last days
[31:25] to get us off balance
[31:36] there's a distraction Even in our homes
[31:39] there's
[31:43] a distraction
[31:50] and he uses it well
[31:53] what is
[31:56] the purpose of distraction
[31:59] is to avoid
[32:02] that we will be able to achieve our
[32:05] goals the
[32:13] and fulfill the real purpose in our
[32:17] lives
[32:20] that's what a distraction causes
[32:23] Aura now
[32:25] una destruction a distraction
[32:28] can can pull us away it can separate us
[32:32] from
[32:35] the the the the the location of what is
[32:39] is wanted to be given to us
[32:45] and the purpose that
[32:47] has for us
[32:50] it's important to know
[32:52] what the how are we distracted
[32:56] or how they come
[33:02] in the form of
[33:05] places
[33:08] and uh things as well
[33:11] yes and this is what happened with David
[33:15] now look
[33:17] yes
[33:21] he was he was a foreigner he was a
[33:24] gentile it was hittite
[33:28] he was also a soldier Guerrero he was a
[33:32] soldier of
[33:34] Elizabeth
[33:37] Elite yeah
[33:42] he was one of the the men of valor of
[33:45] David he was he was a valiant man
[33:50] and now look
[33:53] he was of another religion
[33:56] of a different culture
[33:59] but when he meets the people of Israel
[34:04] through the marriage with Bathsheba is
[34:07] he decides to to turn his face
[34:13] toward what the Israelites believe
[34:16] Uriah
[34:23] 's place even in the Bible demonstrating
[35:04] after the year was expired Jerusalem
[35:30] we just read David
[35:33] stayed in Jerusalem
[35:36] foreign
[35:38] what was this man doing
[35:42] at a time he was The Shepherd of a sheep
[35:46] in in the palace
[35:49] the word of God says that he begins to
[35:53] walk on on the rooftops
[35:56] I imagine he was a little bored
[36:02] maybe he didn't have anything else to do
[36:05] and when you get bored
[36:07] you don't have anything to do
[36:10] you find yourself alone
[36:13] the enemy begins to work
[36:16] I tell you because it's happening I'm
[36:19] being sincere
[36:21] a
[36:24] machinar the Mind begins to imagine
[36:27] things
[36:29] and this happens with David
[36:32] imagine he's bored and all of a sudden
[36:38] what happens
[36:43] in one of the homes
[36:47] he sees this woman
[36:49] and he fixed his eyes
[36:53] upon that beautiful body
[36:55] because dashibo was a very beautiful
[36:58] woman
[37:02] forcefully
[37:06] but not right
[37:09] there's a reflection here
[37:13] how are we Brothers
[37:16] what's our condition
[37:20] now look
[37:26] when we fall into a distraction
[37:30] s
[37:31] many times we begin to develop
[37:34] we we are our loved ones are involved
[37:59] he enters into conflict
[38:03] he decides to forsake Him
[38:19] all because of a distraction
[38:22] meet it look
[38:25] that man
[38:29] um
[38:30] the one that was that was a small
[38:32] Shepherd
[38:34] that that a poet
[38:36] the man that played the harp
[38:39] explain
[38:41] to cast out Souls demons one day he said
[38:46] he said Keep Me Lord from extending my
[38:49] hands
[38:51] the anointed one of God
[38:53] but when you're distracted
[38:57] your nature begins to change all right
[39:01] and here's the other part
[39:05] here's the other attitude of David when
[39:08] he says
[39:09] and he sent a message
[39:16] and he uh he went inner to her
[39:20] attitude and the first attitude
[39:26] it was the attitude of Christ in him
[39:31] but on the second attitude
[39:34] it was this other nature
[39:41] perhaps the spirit of Allah took hold of
[39:43] him yeah
[39:44] and uh and and the consequences
[39:53] that was no longer the attitude of God
[39:55] in David
[40:06] took care of the Sheep
[40:09] the man that loved his people he had
[40:13] changed
[40:14] now look
[40:16] around
[40:20] I want to enter into the the character
[40:23] Uriah
[40:25] and I see three attitudes of this man
[40:28] Implement
[40:31] of second Samuel chapter 11 verse 1 it
[40:35] says
[40:54] one way or another
[41:24] um answered unto David
[41:27] is
[41:36] The Ark in Israel and Judah by intense
[41:38] and my Lord joab and the Servants of my
[41:40] Lord are encamped in the Open Fields
[41:51] so I didn't go into my house to eat and
[41:54] to drink and to lie with my wife as thou
[41:56] livest and as thy Soul live it I will
[41:59] not do this thing
[42:00] do you see the attitude of this man
[42:04] he had Christian principles
[42:07] he was faithful to the to to his
[42:11] Christianity
[42:13] he was not just a Christian by words
[42:16] he was a Christian through deeds
[42:19] and he fulfilled his word
[42:24] the next point
[42:27] second Samuel
[42:30] 11 verse 9.
[42:38] but Uriah said to the door of the King's
[42:40] house with all the Servants of his Lord
[42:42] and went not down to his house
[42:46] I believe that Uriah was showing David
[42:49] something here
[42:50] The loyalty
[42:53] putting God first but for everything
[42:59] he was a
[43:03] H solidario
[43:06] um
[43:06] he was faithful with uh
[43:09] with his brothers
[43:11] with his brother in battle
[43:15] he refuses
[43:18] and and and and and take a shower Comer
[43:22] and eat
[43:24] and be with his wife
[43:44] because they were in battle
[43:52] for the soldiers that were there
[43:57] now we'll go to the third attitude
[44:02] second Samuel 11 verse 17. is
[44:13] the city went out and fought with joab
[44:15] and therefore some of the people of the
[44:17] Servants of David and Uriah the hittite
[44:19] died also
[44:23] esta
[44:25] is
[44:26] this attitude of Uriah the conviction of
[44:29] conviction and and commitment
[44:33] he knew that the words of God
[44:39] fought the battles
[44:43] what's greater with God
[44:46] then when then even even more so than
[44:48] with the King
[44:50] and and because of that
[44:53] what right did David have the permitters
[45:00] to allow himself to get distracted
[45:12] he was not able to relax
[45:18] how could Uriah
[45:23] a God in the middle of War
[45:25] his face
[45:29] they were they were settled on God and I
[45:34] believe this is
[45:57] in the front lines of battle
[46:00] but he was willing to give his life
[46:06] for his people
[46:08] look what brother Branham says
[46:13] in the message you're considering our
[46:15] ways foreign
[47:32] after he did wrong and taken Uriah the
[47:35] hittite's wife
[47:45] and it calls her Gallant husband to be
[47:48] killed in battle
[47:49] but when the prophet Nathan come in
[47:52] and revealed his sins are
[48:17] God will always hear a man or woman
[48:19] that'll turn their feet to his testimony
[48:24] David was worthy of dying
[48:27] and that was the law
[48:30] right
[48:31] he he should have died
[48:35] and he pronounced his own death
[48:38] but Nathan said
[48:40] surely you'll not die
[48:44] for he know David knew God
[48:47] I knew that he'd done wrong
[48:50] he defiled his brother's wife
[49:06] and forgiveness
[49:08] o
[49:10] pares
[49:19] people going on knowing that you're
[49:22] walking hour by hour in the face of
[49:23] death
[49:28] why do we continue on with selfishness
[49:30] and greed and ungodliness
[49:33] in our eyes on the things of the world
[49:37] time we turn back to God's testimony
[49:44] I turned my feet to thy testimony
[49:51] due to a distraction
[49:54] he had a deviated from the way
[49:59] to the point where he had lost the joy
[50:01] of his salvation
[50:03] we have a god that is
[50:07] written Mercy
[50:09] is
[50:11] we are all we we are all going to commit
[50:14] sins
[50:15] I've committed many mistakes
[50:18] and I'll continue perhaps making them
[50:23] yes
[50:32] and then our testimony
[50:35] will be on his behalf
[50:39] sorry you know
[50:45] in California when I was in California
[50:47] I'll be closing with this
[50:55] there was a time in our life
