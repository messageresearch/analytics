[Laughter] [Music] free [Music] god bless you this morning it's a it's a pleasure to be here on a sunday morning i would like to have for you we'll be uh opening the word to ezra chapter four as you read it we send greetings to those who are watching through the internet los armanos in california mexico in california and in mexico weak in the hands of the people of judah and troubled them in the building we're going to be uh having a short prayer para celestial heavenly father thomas gracias i want to thank you my interpreter control the mind of the hearers as well what i would speak would be of edification the opposition can't uh overcome the opposition and this morning i want to focus on discouragement a little of the back story just to refresh your mind the work stopped in the house of the lord laura in some of the things that i found out is that the measure of greatness in a person's life the measure of the greatness of anyone you can think of even yourself is measured it is medieval by what it takes to discourage us and we know he was a great man because it took a lot to discourage him just like the temple stop and then the voices that come into our mind also discourage us they discouraged discouragement causes people to feel defeated and want to give up for the lord in their lives say that again they want to give up for the lord they want to give up what they're doing for the lord and if it's not for the lord he wants to give up what they're doing for themselves and the word of god says that god is so you don't think you're the only one discouraged this morning [Music] by god's grace i'm here and a couple of examples so we don't feel alone moses ran away from egypt with discouragement elijah the great man that caught fire at some point he wanted to die job was discouraged when he saw his children dying and i feel like the biggest discouragement that a person could face in my shoes i identify with the apostle peter discouragement is what leads us to hopelessness and the enemy of our soul loves to do that and i the devil can use that very simply brother and now can you imagine these people the people of israel doing what the lord told them to do us and you feel very strong about something you know and all we're seeing is a horrible time just not in a then sees the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem so it's seized unto the second year of the reign of darius king of persia del rey they had remember that the one that sent them was king cyrus but now there's been three kings since then and obviously building a temple is not from day to night it takes years and as you know they write a letter to artist xerxes saying these are a rebellious people don't let them build a working this is god's doing is this they went to jerusalem originally under ezra and by the leadership of the lord uh and a little bit of work here a little bit of work there there's some stone sitting here yeah and this is where haggai the prophet comes in and if we can turn to haggai and i'll be starting my message in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month the first day of the month came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shaltil governor of judah and to joshua the son of josedic the high priest saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying this people say so notice god is saying they hired counselors now indeed they're attorneys these people are saying the time has not come for the lord's house to be built human life is that we come before obstacles but sooner or later we run into obstacles and some of us might say i've said well i guess god didn't want me to do it and the people of israel were shut down of the lord's temple and so they might say if i was back there i could have said and putting the blame on god putting the blame on god for the fact they're not going forward and doing what god told them uh argenized the time hasn't come for the lord's house to be built the time hasn't come to surrender my life pleasure and it's hard to abstain from pleasure amen i'm in and aren't we really good aren't we really good that when we we do it in a way of convenience because we're running into because we're running into opposition now if you follow me to 2nd timothy 3. paul telling timothy and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall be happy [Music] is that what it says this hassle difficulties trials challenges we should just consider is open unto me and there are many many words let's say it all together many adversaries adversaries the apostle paul saying that he's received a great open door a great effectual door is open and many opposed me he says that's what that was what paul's way of knowing is that's how paul knew as he said pablo that god had him where he wanted him because there was plenty of opposition opposition to paul was part of the journey of interpreting there's problems happening we the will of god circumstantially one three uh then came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet saying [Music] [Applause] we say i can't fight against the will of god what do you think i am uh has anyone thought that but now in verse 5 god speaks about their behavior and it says that they don't they drink but they're not full and other things they have wages and they pull in a bag of holes it's in verse six but i don't have enough time but what god is telling them since you're so good at interpreting my will she is have you noticed you don't harvest like you used to okay like when you were serving me have you noticed you eat but are never full okay have you noticed you aren't being satisfied go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and i will take pleasure in it and will be glorified saith the lord which one is that haggai 1-8 it says uh and i will be glorified or forgive me i will take pleasure in it and i will be glorified so god will take pleasure that and god is saying how about doing something for my pleasure how about living for my honor your house is being honored well mine is in ruins and dishonored condos well this temple is in this honor [Music] all right and now we see in the end says then zerubbabel the son of shaltil and joshua the son of josedic the high priest with all the remnant of the people obey the voice of the lord their god and the words of haggai the prophet and to me that's awesome to hear they begin to walk in wisdom when they began to fear the lord god bless you [Applause] in the first book of hagai no the chapter gives a mighty weapon to his people that's right brother he speaks to them through the prophet and speaks to them about time he says the lord has spoken to you thus speak the lord of hosts people say the time has not come the time that the lord's house should be built notice how he speaks to them about you diablo how the the devil avia usado had used what they [Music] is this was the idea that the devil had placed in their minds and they were speaking it amongst themselves they they didn't have to do it they believed that it had to be done they believed they had to uh build a temple but the lie of the devil and the deceit that was the lie of [Applause] christ and especially in the way of bringing the words if there's a time when there's a spirit surrounding thinking that nothing happened but at this moment that's the word of god [Music] speaks on time [Applause] [Applause] you can run and run through the ages and eternity and they're never never never been into it and that's the way god is the devil perverted in brazil because it's a terrible word the little hickey el moreno is a hickey brother says hickey in english but it's like a a little there's a little gap that comes down though it breaks over this way goes out this way god had to do that what brother brother puts it here he says and now time is this little loop that loops down jesus jesus was from eternity to eternity but he stepped into the times and came through here in order to sanctify our put a streak of blood all across this place to reach it that's all the time is [Applause] to just kind of break it down because many times we misunderstand time and we waste time we don't care about you about the opportunities god gives us i want you to understand one he's talking until jesus yes caused the time to come into action not in the form of a father but in the form of a study in the form of the father of the father god is eternal foreign [Applause] you will be eliminated but not [Applause] perfect and bringing them back into eternity things [Music] and we waste where we can be a part of this plan or we could just decide when how much or how much quanto how much god can use us throughout that time opportunity what are you doing with your time if you're waiting for the perfect time just like them it'll never arrive it will never arrive there will always be an excuse there will always waiting for what are you waiting for shall be finished [Applause] to the grace of god every day we're waiting for somebody uh are we waiting for the pastor what if the pastor never does it are you gonna stay there take advantage of what has been given to them there won't ever be a perfect time but at any moment there's something we could do maybe we won't be able to do it all immediately [Music] even with just so you can't do anything diablo but you've given a lot to the devil that's what the devil or god's telling you so you you say you can't do anything for me but you've given a lot to the devil to worship how do you spend so much time on your phone how do you spend so much time speaking about talking about others we changed what we were doing that we have change your mind to give god that's what we say right we look at our condition my pockets are empty my heart's empty my mind is empty i got nothing against you that's why i come empty the church and i leave empty i got nothing to give you have nothing to give why do you give so much to your to your vices or your habits brothers thirst of the fountain of the water of life freely in other words you take advantage of time the principle the beginning in the end is to give freely but you have this moment i've always told you why not give him this moment why leave to your house empty the musicians can't come forward lord look many times people that say they have they have a little bit of time it's because they've used it in the the wrong things we're still [Applause] take advantage [Music] you have this moment [Music] moment to say lord [Music] please stand [Music] because i took advantage of that moment [Music] but give this moment to him give it to him yes give it to him oh he let's see oh church [Music] i don't [Applause] i want to give it to him
