[24:26] but amen amen amen uh Hebrews 11:15
[24:30] verse
[24:32] 16 uh says and truly if they had been
[24:36] mindful of that country from whence they
[24:38] came out they might have had opportunity
[24:41] to have
[24:48] returned but now they desire a better
[24:50] country that is in Heavenly wherefore

[24:55] God for he hath prepared for them a
[25:07] city we'll go to uh the Gospel of Luke
[25:10] Chapter
[25:14] 2 we'll be reading verse 25
[25:22] and Luke 2 verse 25 and 26 Lucas cap
[25:30] it reads like this say and behold there
[25:34] was a man in Jerusalem whose name was
[25:37] Simeon and the same man was just and
[25:39] devout waiting for the consolation of
[25:42] Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon
[25:54] him and it was revealed unto him by the
[25:57] Holy Ghost ghost that he should not see
[25:59] death before he had seen the Lord's
[26:08] Christ that let us bow our heads in
[26:12] prayer Heavenly

[27:29] May at the end of the service your Holy
[27:31] Name be
[27:34] glorified we ask this in the name of our
[27:36] Lord Jesus
[27:38] Christ amen
[27:40] amen uh you may be
[27:44] seated uh yeah I was uh talking with our
[27:47] pastor back in the
[27:51] back and uh uh one of the questions I
[27:54] used to ask myself uh when I would read
[27:56] uh uh the message messages
[28:03] expectations uh one of the things I'd
[28:06] always ask myself was why why does
[28:07] brother brandham talk about this man so
[28:12] much he he he preached on him quite
[28:15] often as a matter of
[28:18] fact probably sa more than 10 or 15
[28:22] times he preached message
[28:26] expectations
[28:28] not exactly sure but it was it was more
[28:30] than 10 times for
[28:33] sure and uh one of the things you know
[28:36] that I I really uh God led me to uh to
[28:40] preach on of
[28:44] Simeon uh was uh you know how how devout
[28:48] you know he he was to what he
[28:56] did and uh you know he the history says
[29:00] that he was an elderly
[29:02] man nobody knows exactly how old he
[29:07] was uh but some people uh some people
[29:12] say that he could have been over the
[29:15] hundred years of
[29:16] [Music]
[29:18] age but nobody knows for
[29:21] sure and that just uh shows you know how
[29:24] devoted he was you know to uh to the
[29:27] Lord
[29:31] and how devoted he was to to the service
[29:33] of
[29:36] God and uh you know you have to really
[29:39] uh God really has to honor someone like
[29:43] that when you stand at your post of
[29:47] Duty I imagine every time he went to the
[29:50] to the
[29:52] temple uh I'm sure his legs
[29:56] hurt you know when you get up there in
[30:00] age it seems like everything
[30:03] hurts uh but uh he didn't allow his
[30:09] conditions or his
[30:12] circumstances you know to get in the way
[30:15] of what was told to
[30:18] him amen amen you see because God had
[30:21] revealed to him
[30:24] something you know that he would not see
[30:26] death
[30:28] you know until until he saw the
[30:31] consolation of
[30:35] Israel how many come expecting something
[30:37] this this uh this
[30:41] service I I I know it's a
[30:44] Wednesday but I believe it's a good
[30:46] day any anytime you can come to the
[30:49] house of
[30:51] God it's a good
[30:53] day I I believe that I believe God could
[30:57] work on a
[30:59] Wednesday just like he can on a
[31:02] Sunday it don't matter if you come
[31:04] expecting
[31:06] something then God can do
[31:08] it it just got to has to be revealed to
[31:11] you you know and this is the type of
[31:14] Revelation that that Simeon
[31:17] had amen amen you know we're getting
[31:20] close to the end of the
[31:23] year and uh you know uh Simeon was
[31:25] getting close to the end of his life
[31:29] oh but that didn't stop him from going
[31:31] to the house of
[31:33] God he may not have seen what he he was
[31:37] expecting
[31:40] yet but it didn't stop
[31:42] him you see you may not have seen what
[31:45] you're expecting this
[31:49] year but you can still have
[31:52] it you know if you're
[31:55] expecting amen amen
[31:59] you know the thing about it is a lot of
[32:02] times is that you know uh he was he he
[32:06] was he was
[32:08] expecting he was waiting for the
[32:11] consolation of
[32:14] Israel amen amen you know so that was
[32:17] the
[32:19] Revelation you know that he was
[32:21] expecting to
[32:23] obtain you know because when we come to
[32:25] church a lot of times
[32:28] you know God deals with individuals
[32:32] amen the Bible says it was revealed unto
[32:37] him that he was going to see the
[32:40] consolation of
[32:42] Israel Not only was he going to see
[32:46] it but he was going to hold
[32:50] it he was going to have it in his
[32:53] hands amen amen you know I I wouldn't
[32:56] that be
[32:57] something you see if what you were
[33:01] expecting you could
[33:04] possess you see his his sight may have
[33:06] been
[33:08] dimon you see because he was older in
[33:12] age you see but the but the eyesight of
[33:14] his
[33:16] faith it never
[33:19] damned it never
[33:21] weakened you see his legs may have been
[33:23] feeling shaky when he'd go to the
[33:25] temple
[33:28] but but he but his faith did not
[33:32] weaken because he wasn't looking at what
[33:34] he
[33:36] felt or the circumstances he was
[33:39] in or how much money he
[33:42] had or that he wasn't happy about what
[33:45] he got or didn't
[33:48] get he wasn't living in that
[33:51] moment you see he was looking
[33:55] ahead and that's how we should
[33:58] live see we shouldn't be looking at our
[34:02] circumstances we should be expecting
[34:04] something
[34:06] better amen amen he wanted something
[34:13] better we should want something
[34:19] better you know uh this time of
[34:23] year you know it was uh was telling you
[34:27] know uh some of the brothers while
[34:31] back you know there they're kind of hard
[34:34] for me
[34:37] sometimes you know grow growing up we we
[34:40] didn't we didn't get a whole
[34:43] lot you know there wasn't a whole lot to
[34:48] expect you know um one of the things you
[34:51] know that
[34:53] uh that that I guess that that affected
[34:56] me
[34:58] you know I I I honest I'm going to be
[35:00] honest with
[35:01] you I I I grew up to to hate days like
[35:05] like holidays like around this
[35:11] time I'm not trying to be a grinch or
[35:16] anything you know but uh I uh you know
[35:19] that green guy you know that on the
[35:21] cartoons you guys
[35:23] know you know but you know I I don't
[35:27] Christmas passed anyway I can't take
[35:31] nothing but uh the thing of it
[35:34] is is that you know I growing up as a
[35:36] child I wouldn't get a whole
[35:39] lot you know and that was kind of
[35:42] difficult it's kind of difficult to see
[35:44] other people getting
[35:47] things you know and uh you know I'd look
[35:51] outside and I see everybody else playing
[35:53] with their
[35:55] toys and you know you know we wouldn't
[35:59] really have very
[36:01] much uh but but you know so I wasn't
[36:04] really expecting a whole lot you know
[36:05] when I was
[36:08] younger you know but I think that God
[36:09] was building character the whole time
[36:15] amen you know I could live with or
[36:17] without you know the
[36:21] gifts you know but one thing I can't
[36:23] live without is
[36:25] him I can't live without
[36:28] Jesus you know he's the source of
[36:30] everything I
[36:32] have you know Paul
[36:34] said I am what I
[36:37] am by the grace of
[36:40] God you know and so God's been good
[36:43] amen he's been
[36:45] good you know he's you know if we didn't
[36:48] open anything else
[36:51] up you know we open up some tamales you
[36:53] know this uh this Christmas
[36:57] you know but but even so God's been good
[37:01] amen but you know even greater than
[37:04] that the greatest thing that he has been
[37:07] able to give
[37:08] us is that he has opened up his
[37:12] word that's the greatest thing God can
[37:15] do is to open up the
[37:18] word because that's the greatest thing
[37:20] that you can
[37:22] have he's opened up the word to his
[37:25] children
[37:27] amen amen he's opened it
[37:32] up and that's what makes me desire
[37:36] more I cuz I know there's something
[37:39] better amen
[37:42] amen but a lot of times we think that
[37:44] he's
[37:46] done uh but you know I I remember
[37:48] growing
[37:50] up you know I was barely you know
[37:53] starting to get to know the
[37:55] message
[37:57] and
[37:58] uh one of the things I I remember uh
[38:01] quite
[38:04] well was that you know the Lord revealed
[38:06] to me you know what I should do in my
[38:11] career and uh you know I remember I went
[38:13] in and I put in my two weeks
[38:18] notice you know I was trying to do the
[38:20] right
[38:21] thing and uh you know one of one of my
[38:24] the
[38:25] boss you know he he told me he said you
[38:29] know what he's like you leave and he's
[38:32] like I'll never hire you
[38:35] back you know and I remember telling him
[38:37] uh
[38:41] this I said uh you know uh Cliff cuz his
[38:44] name was Cliff Cliff uh you know I don't
[38:47] leave a place of of I don't leave a
[38:51] place you know uh so that I could come
[38:54] back to
[38:55] it you know I I I I I leave it because
[38:59] there's something better out
[39:01] there now I was just I was believing
[39:05] that there was something better out
[39:08] there you see I was expecting there was
[39:11] something better out
[39:14] there but you know I I didn't have it
[39:17] quite
[39:18] yet you see they had just told me about
[39:23] it and you know I think uh when uh you
[39:26] leave the service of the
[39:30] devil when you stop serving
[39:33] him he he don't like it he he doesn't he
[39:37] wants to keep you right
[39:39] there you know and he says I won't take
[39:42] you back if you
[39:46] leave if you take off I'm not getting
[39:48] you
[39:50] back and you know he didn't have a whole
[39:53] lot to begin with
[39:55] amen
[39:57] because if he
[39:58] did then I wouldn't be right
[40:01] here I wouldn't be here if the devil had
[40:05] something to offer
[40:06] me I would not be serving
[40:10] God
[40:12] Amen he's a
[40:14] liar he he lies about what he tells
[40:18] you and he and he and he just he just
[40:21] he's a he's just a
[40:23] liar you know but a lot of times we
[40:25] believe his
[40:28] Lies We believe what he's telling
[40:30] us we believe what he's what that what
[40:33] we have at the moment is
[40:37] good but my
[40:39] ambitions you see the Ambitions of a Son
[40:42] of
[40:43] God are not very
[40:47] low you see the standards have gone
[40:52] up and they've gone up
[40:55] substantially
[40:58] that's exactly
[40:59] right it wasn't just a little bit
[41:03] better I went from
[41:07] poverty uh to completely
[41:10] rich I am rich in
[41:13] Mercy I have I have I have so much
[41:17] peace I have so much love I got so much
[41:22] joy I have
[41:25] everything God has it's in the house
[41:30] it's in God's
[41:32] Storehouse and he can give it to
[41:35] you if you want
[41:37] it if you can accept it for you you see
[41:41] if you expecting that then God can give
[41:45] it to
[41:47] you but that's the
[41:50] problem we don't
[41:52] expect we're not
[41:55] expecting we're not in
[41:58] service I
[42:00] believe that
[42:02] Simeon was so
[42:06] careful to make it to the house of
[42:10] God uh
[42:12] because he was
[42:15] scared he was
[42:17] fearful that he might
[42:20] miss he might miss what God had promised
[42:25] him so I
[42:27] believe I I
[42:29] believe that when he got
[42:33] up he maybe his body
[42:36] hurts you know when I get up in the
[42:39] morning like I being I'm just my body's
[42:42] just popping all over the
[42:44] place my my bones are
[42:48] popping and and you know just you just
[42:50] get
[42:52] older and uh you know um CA
[42:57] you know she's like man you're Pop
[43:00] Rocks rocks you know you know it's a if
[43:04] you know English you know you you get it
[43:06] but but so basically you you I'll
[43:10] explain it to you
[43:13] later but but you know so my uh that
[43:17] that's your your body just pops you
[43:20] know you just get
[43:23] older and I believe the simeon's body
[43:27] was very
[43:30] frail and uh and you know he and but
[43:33] that didn't stop him because I know In
[43:37] the
[43:38] Flesh he wanted to stay laying
[43:42] down in the flesh he wanted to stay
[43:45] laying
[43:45] [Applause]
[43:47] down but you know he
[43:50] remembered he remembered the
[43:53] Revelation it was revealed unto him
[43:59] see a lot of people
[44:02] think that you know the Revelation
[44:06] comes uh when uh you're because you're a
[44:09] part of the
[44:12] church amen amen you see because people
[44:16] nowadays when you talk about
[44:19] church oh they are they they think about
[44:22] the
[44:24] building they think about this being the
[44:28] church you see but in all
[44:31] reality is that this building is not the
[44:35] church amen amen it's it's not the
[44:38] church you want me to tell you who the
[44:40] church
[44:42] is it's you you see you are the
[44:46] church amen amen so the Revelation
[44:49] doesn't come to a whole
[44:52] group it comes to an individual
[44:56] you see it was a private
[44:59] Revelation it was a revelation between
[45:01] him and
[45:03] God because if it
[45:05] wasn't then everybody else would have
[45:11] known everybody else in the
[45:17] temple everybody else in that
[45:20] Temple I would have known who Jesus was
[45:25] you see all the religious
[45:27] people they would have
[45:30] known but they didn't because it was not
[45:34] revealed unto
[45:36] them you see that's why that's why
[45:39] people act kind of different in
[45:42] church oh because something's been
[45:44] revealed to
[45:46] them something has happened in
[45:49] them they have got they have CAU the
[45:54] Revelation amen amen it's it's an
[45:56] individual
[45:58] Affair it's it's not just a
[46:01] religion it is a
[46:04] relationship it's a
[46:07] relationship and that's what God wants
[46:10] you see when you have re when you have a
[46:13] relationship oh then then things change
[46:17] you get to know the
[46:19] person on a more intimate
[46:22] level so that's when God
[46:26] or can be begin to reveal
[46:29] things and I believe that's the kind of
[46:34] relationship that Simeon
[46:36] had because the Bible
[46:39] says that the Holy
[46:41] Ghost was upon
[46:44] Him amen amen so he had some
[46:48] Revelation and until you until you don't
[46:51] get that new
[46:54] birth until you get the new
[46:58] rebirth you won't get any type of
[47:02] Revelation amen
[47:07] amen so that's what we
[47:10] want we want
[47:12] God you see to
[47:15] reveal to reveal to
[47:20] you what it is that you're
[47:23] needing to reveal to you
[47:27] what it is that you
[47:29] want amen
[47:33] amen I'm going to keep reading in verse
[47:38] 27 but the Bible says
[47:41] this and he came by the spirit into the
[47:49] temple you see he didn't come in the
[47:53] flesh but he came in the spirit
[47:57] you see I
[47:58] wonder how we
[48:01] come to the house of God how do we come
[48:05] in the
[48:06] spirit because if you come in the
[48:09] spirit then the spirit can do
[48:13] things you see the spirit
[48:16] moves you see it moved
[48:19] him or to go to the
[48:22] temple yeah his body may have been
[48:24] hurting
[48:27] you see he may have been he may have
[48:29] been not feeling very well that
[48:32] day but that did not stop
[48:35] him because when you get the
[48:39] spirit there's not a thing that can stop
[48:43] you from coming into the presence of
[48:47] God amen amen I believe it I believe it
[48:52] with all my
[48:54] heart
[48:59] I keep
[49:02] reading it says that when the parents
[49:04] brought in the Child Jesus to do for him
[49:07] after the custom of the
[49:08] [Applause]
[49:14] law says then took he him him up in his
[49:17] arms and blessed God and
[49:24] said now let us thou serve thy servant
[49:26] depart in peace according to Thy
[49:33] word for my eyes have seen thy
[49:38] salvation amen amen you see how I I want
[49:42] you to
[49:44] notice of that last
[49:46] part it says for mine
[49:50] eyes my eyes have seen thy
[49:54] salvation it wasn't the brother it
[49:56] wasn't brother Tito's
[49:59] eyes it wasn't brother Isaac's eyes you
[50:03] see it cannot be somebody else's
[50:06] eyes it has to be your
[50:08] eyes see you have to see it you have to
[50:13] want it you have to work for it but you
[50:17] have to go get
[50:18] it and the devil's going to do
[50:20] everything in his
[50:23] power to stop it
[50:27] he's going to do everything he
[50:30] can so that you look at anything
[50:35] else except for God's
[50:38] word because that's where the Revelation
[50:42] is the Revelation was
[50:45] given it's been
[50:47] given through a
[50:50] prophet amen amen and we believe it we
[50:54] believe it
[50:56] amen who believes
[50:57] it amen I I believe it I believe I
[51:01] believe then I'm standing amongst
[51:05] people that believe the same
[51:07] thing that are working for one
[51:11] cause working working for one
[51:15] purpose work serving one
[51:19] God under one
[51:22] spirit I believe it
[51:27] it's
[51:28] one it's one
[51:33] spirit I believe
[51:38] it I'm going to read a
[51:41] message it's well it's it's a quote from
[51:43] Brother brandom
[51:48] uh it says
[51:50] this I'm expecting greater
[51:54] things
[51:57] say I'm Baptist I'm Methodist I'm oness
[51:59] two is
[52:05] three or whatever you
[52:07] are you see that don't satisfy
[52:10] me I got Ambitions to move
[52:14] on till I meet
[52:17] him then he says up up up up
[52:22] up he says I receive the Holy Ghost
[52:27] that settles
[52:28] it it didn't with
[52:31] me that's what brother Bram
[52:35] says it says I'm still I'm just still
[52:38] taking
[52:40] it and I'm moving higher and
[52:43] higher just moving on way
[52:46] high high
[52:49] Ambitions
[52:51] expectations
[52:53] Ambitions says well we got a pretty nice
[52:55] little
[52:58] church we'll just settle down me and
[53:00] this little
[53:04] crowd that's not enough for
[53:08] me that is not enough for brother
[53:12] VI I I don't know about you but I am not
[53:16] satisfied with just a church
[53:18] building because I don't believe that
[53:20] God put us
[53:21] here to just chill
[53:24] out just
[53:26] relax but it's time to keep
[53:28] pressing we got to keep moving we have
[53:32] to keep
[53:33] believing keep
[53:36] expecting that God has
[53:38] more because when you believe
[53:41] it oh then God will take you to move one
[53:45] more time it will take you to
[53:47] move it will take you to do
[53:51] something because it's a
[53:54] revelation
[53:56] yes this this isn't
[53:58] it it's not it for
[54:03] me I came from a
[54:06] place and and you know it got to it
[54:09] gotten where you know I I just it got
[54:12] just so uh so
[54:15] traditional no the place where I come
[54:20] from and uh you know I just I couldn't
[54:22] believe
[54:23] it and and you know the devil is like
[54:26] this is
[54:27] it that's
[54:29] it you see that the message in my head
[54:32] he was telling
[54:35] me the devil you know he talks to
[54:39] you the message isn't
[54:42] real the Revelation is not
[54:44] [Applause]
[54:46] real but I just something inside me
[54:48] could not accept
[54:51] that because I had been with
[54:54] God you see when you catch the
[54:57] Revelation you don't beat into the
[55:01] lies you don't beat into your
[55:06] circumstances you don't feel into your
[55:09] feelings so many
[55:12] feelings we don't move by
[55:15] feelings we move by the
[55:18] spirit moved by the Holy
[55:21] Spirit that's what moves
[55:24] me what moves God's
[55:26] church and when it's a real
[55:29] Revelation it moves you it moves you
[55:33] more it'll take you higher it'll take
[55:37] you
[55:38] further and then you become some kind of
[55:43] weirdo you become a weirdo amen you what
[55:47] separates you from everybody else do you
[55:50] know what separates
[55:52] you it's your faith
[55:55] that's what separates
[55:57] you it's the truth because you you
[56:02] know but when you catch the
[56:05] Revelation you know this world isn't
[56:07] your
[56:08] home you just
[56:11] moving you can't be
[56:14] satisfied with these little
[56:17] things these things are
[56:20] nothing but this is not my
[56:22] home I got to go higher
[56:26] I got to go
[56:27] further I want more
[56:30] peace I want more
[56:32] Comfort I want
[56:37] consolation that's what I
[56:40] want these things don't satisfy
[56:47] me and
[56:49] uh you know
[56:53] imagine when people saw Simeon going to
[56:56] the
[57:00] temple imagine they'd look at
[57:03] him they'd
[57:06] laugh it'd mock
[57:08] them look at that crazy old
[57:13] man going to the
[57:16] temple and they'd say amongst
[57:20] themselves you know he's been doing it
[57:22] for
[57:23] years
[57:27] and there hasn't been a
[57:29] change there hasn't been a
[57:32] difference he's gotten
[57:38] older he's gotten a little
[57:45] crazier and nobody wants to be around
[57:47] him
[57:52] anymore even your own family doesn't
[57:54] want want to be around you
[57:58] sometimes you're too
[58:00] weird you're too
[58:03] different they talk about some
[58:07] Prophet they talk about Jesus's Second
[58:12] Coming they've been talking about that
[58:14] for
[58:15] years how
[58:20] ridiculous ain't that
[58:22] right isn't that right
[58:26] see I
[58:30] imagine that there was
[58:33] many many men of
[58:36] God that served along with
[58:42] Simeon and they had fallen away from the
[58:48] faith they couldn't
[58:51] wait they couldn't wait any
[58:53] longer their
[58:56] faith had
[58:58] weakened their eyes had
[59:04] dimmed but not
[59:07] Simeon Simeon had the eyes of an
[59:13] eagle he had the eyes of an
[59:16] eagle and I
[59:19] believe that he had the heart of a
[59:22] lion I believe that
[59:25] because a
[59:26] lion a lion won't give up a lion keep
[59:31] fighting it's not going to stop
[59:34] him or whatever he goes for or he takes
[59:38] it it's his it's not going to
[59:43] stop that's the kind of Faith he
[59:47] had that's the kind of
[59:49] Faith a son and daughter of God should
[59:53] have the eyes of an
[59:56] eagle because they caught the
[59:59] vision because they've got higher
[1:00:02] they've got
[1:00:03] higher and they've got
[1:00:05] higher and they've got higher they've
[1:00:08] got above their
[1:00:11] problems above their
[1:00:14] circumstances above their
[1:00:17] feelings above their
[1:00:23] situation
[1:00:26] am now keep in
[1:00:29] mind that
[1:00:32] Simeon was still in the
[1:00:36] flesh he was still in his
[1:00:39] body amen amen as long as you're in this
[1:00:45] body you'll have
[1:00:48] feelings you'll have those
[1:00:52] desires you'll have the
[1:00:57] opportunities to go
[1:00:59] back the opportunities are
[1:01:03] there on a daily
[1:01:06] basis every
[1:01:07] day there's an
[1:01:10] opportunity to go
[1:01:13] back when you're in this
[1:01:17] body because the
[1:01:20] flesh it fights against the
[1:01:23] spirit so every
[1:01:26] day unless you know you've uh you've
[1:01:28] already made
[1:01:32] it but you know I still have a ways to
[1:01:37] go I still have
[1:01:40] people you know I still have people I
[1:01:42] have to
[1:01:43] help the Lord still has to help
[1:01:47] me that's why it's so
[1:01:50] important you know to stay in the
[1:01:53] spirit be in the
[1:01:56] spirit you see when we when we preach up
[1:02:00] here you see when the minister are up
[1:02:02] here brother Tito's up
[1:02:05] here I believe he's in the
[1:02:09] spirit because I believe that God has
[1:02:11] has SP spoke with
[1:02:13] him and has revealed to him you know
[1:02:17] things that the church
[1:02:21] needs but when you're not open to that
[1:02:26] then it gets real
[1:02:29] hard you're like
[1:02:34] well I don't know what but he's
[1:02:40] on I don't know what he's
[1:02:44] taking because I don't feel that
[1:02:48] way I want to tell you something
[1:02:51] Brothers
[1:02:53] SS you don't know what you're
[1:02:56] missing you know when
[1:02:59] Caleb he went to the promised
[1:03:02] land oh he had some
[1:03:05] wine know he had he got he had
[1:03:09] grapes I believe that I believe Caleb
[1:03:12] drank some
[1:03:13] wine I believe that you don't have
[1:03:17] to oh because as soon as he got back to
[1:03:19] tell
[1:03:21] everybody he was ready to go back
[1:03:26] yeah let's go we got to go take what's
[1:03:30] ours you got to leave all that you got
[1:03:32] to leave Egypt behind
[1:03:34] you we got to go get what's
[1:03:38] ours and you know he was
[1:03:40] ready he was he was in the
[1:03:43] spirit he had CAU the
[1:03:47] Revelation he was ready to go
[1:03:50] back you see in this coming
[1:03:53] year we got to we got to catch that
[1:03:57] Revelation if you don't have
[1:03:59] it go get it you got to work for
[1:04:04] it you got to go get
[1:04:07] it and when you get
[1:04:09] it I'll be ready I'll be ready to go
[1:04:14] fight be ready to go get what is
[1:04:18] yours you got to leave everything in the
[1:04:21] past because something God has something
[1:04:24] more for you
[1:04:26] ahead see he's not
[1:04:32] done I'm
[1:04:42] closing know there's a lot of
[1:04:48] times especially you know in in in the
[1:04:51] circumstance of
[1:04:53] Simeon
[1:05:00] where you know it becomes it gets a
[1:05:02] little disappointing
[1:05:07] perhaps when you may not have received
[1:05:09] what you
[1:05:13] wanted may not have received
[1:05:17] perhaps your
[1:05:20] healing
[1:05:22] or Deliverance
[1:05:27] or your
[1:05:30] peace you know things of the
[1:05:33] past you know keep coming
[1:05:38] back and they haunt
[1:05:41] you you know because because that's what
[1:05:43] the devil
[1:05:44] wants he wants to he wants to haunt
[1:05:48] you he wants to torment
[1:05:51] you he wants you to think
[1:05:55] that there's nothing for
[1:05:57] you that it's all
[1:05:59] over everything is
[1:06:02] finished that you'll always be that
[1:06:07] way that he brought you this
[1:06:11] far only to be
[1:06:16] disappointed
[1:06:21] again year after year
[1:06:24] you may have been waiting for
[1:06:30] something but I
[1:06:36] believe that that last day that Simeon
[1:06:40] went into the
[1:06:45] temple when God showed
[1:06:48] him when God gave
[1:06:51] him in his hands
[1:06:55] what he had been waiting for his whole
[1:06:58] life I
[1:07:00] believe that it was worth
[1:07:02] it it was worth more than everybody
[1:07:05] laughing at
[1:07:07] him I don't think that Simeon could hear
[1:07:10] the
[1:07:12] people you don't believe that he could
[1:07:14] hear a
[1:07:16] mocking and laughing at him and letting
[1:07:20] him know he was
[1:07:21] crazy and letting him know that it was
[1:07:24] going to be
[1:07:25] nothing that God wasn't
[1:07:28] real but it
[1:07:31] was and he saw it he saw it with his own
[1:07:35] eyes you see Simon could have stayed in
[1:07:38] bed that
[1:07:44] day job
[1:07:47] H he could have stayed on the ground
[1:07:50] that
[1:07:52] day scratching his
[1:07:58] boils but he
[1:08:02] didn't I believe they got
[1:08:05] up and I tell
[1:08:08] you you may be fine trying to find
[1:08:15] comfort and all these other
[1:08:19] things you may be going through
[1:08:22] pain may not
[1:08:25] know how to get
[1:08:28] help but I can tell you one
[1:08:33] thing that Simeon didn't stay
[1:08:36] down that job didn't stay
[1:08:40] down and I believe that when Paul
[1:08:44] fell on his road to
[1:08:47] Damascus he didn't stay
[1:08:51] down and above all
[1:08:56] Jesus didn't stay
[1:08:59] down but he got
[1:09:01] up he rose
[1:09:03] up he rose
[1:09:05] up because he
[1:09:08] knew that one day he was going to see
[1:09:12] his
[1:09:13] seed he was going to see his
[1:09:17] seed I believe
[1:09:19] it and I take that for
[1:09:22] me
[1:09:25] it has to be
[1:09:28] personal it has to be
[1:09:30] something that God has to show
[1:09:33] you see the church the church ain't
[1:09:36] going to show
[1:09:39] you it has to be the Holy
[1:09:43] Ghost he'll show you the Bible says that
[1:09:48] he'll take you to all
[1:09:50] truth he'll guide you to all truth
[1:09:56] let us bow our heads to
[1:09:57] pray you please
[1:10:00] stand Heavenly
[1:10:02] Father we thank you

[1:20:54] [Music]
[1:20:59] sometimes we
[1:21:02] think if I were someone important in the
[1:21:05] temple Sim if Simeon was something temp
[1:21:10] sometimes we
[1:21:11] think s was someone important in the
[1:21:15] temple but he was
[1:21:17] not he wasn't a
[1:21:19] priest he was not a levite
[1:21:24] he wasn't someone who helped out in the
[1:21:27] temple he was simply a
[1:21:32] worshipper he was simply a
[1:21:35] worshipper went to the temple to worship
[1:21:38] God the temple to worship
[1:21:43] God he was simply a
[1:21:47] member but the Bible says he was
[1:21:50] just it was righteous and
[1:21:54] devout he was someone
[1:21:57] faithful he was someone who was
[1:22:01] faithful and I
[1:22:05] believe if we're only just
[1:22:10] faithful if we say
[1:22:15] Lord I don't feel like doing this for
[1:22:17] you right
[1:22:19] now but I will be
[1:22:21] faithful
[1:22:23] I will do what I came to do
[1:22:24] Lord I will
[1:22:29] do what you called me to do a
[1:22:34] worshipper I believe it's
[1:22:38] possible the Bible says that the temple
[1:22:40] the spirit moved the
[1:22:43] temple and I start to
[1:22:50] meditate that perhaps the devil was
[1:22:52] telling him
[1:22:53] him why do you keep going
[1:22:55] on why do you keep
[1:22:59] waiting why do you keep
[1:23:02] trying why do you keep waiting on
[1:23:09] God I believe the devil placed a lot of
[1:23:12] thoughts in his
[1:23:14] mind many stumbling
[1:23:19] blocks but I believe that day he said
[1:23:24] I will go and worship him
[1:23:28] anyways
[1:23:33] anyways thank you
[1:23:36] anyway to church like
[1:23:39] [Applause]
[1:23:40] that
[1:23:44] anys I'm G to worship
[1:23:51] Him
[1:23:56] I will worship him
[1:23:58] anyways I'll worship him
[1:24:07] anyways maybe that was his thought that
[1:24:10] day I worship him
[1:24:16] anyways tremendous
[1:24:18] amen all
[1:24:21] right okay
[1:24:23] I
[1:24:26] believe if we could only keep on
[1:24:33] waiting being faithful with
[1:24:38] God I'll keep on waiting say I'll keep
[1:24:40] on
[1:24:45] waiting tell your neighbor I'll keep on
[1:24:51] waiting but say it like you believe
[1:24:54] it I'll I'll keep on
[1:24:57] waiting you waiting on
[1:25:02] God I believe you're always waiting for
[1:25:04] something on
[1:25:06] God I believe there's no ending
[1:25:11] point you should always be waiting for
[1:25:13] something from
[1:25:14] God what else do you
[1:25:16] have what other blessings have I will
[1:25:20] keep on
[1:25:21] waiting
[1:25:26] we don't receive because we don't
[1:25:33] wait and we feel like God doesn't listen
[1:25:36] to
[1:25:39] us revive that calling inside of
[1:25:42] you Rive that inside of
[1:25:45] you I will keep on
[1:25:49] waiting maybe I got a little impatient
[1:25:53] maybe I got a little
[1:25:57] imp I will keep on
[1:26:00] waiting

[1:27:17] temple so they can give him something he
[1:27:20] went to worship
[1:27:23] that's why he went to the temple not
[1:27:25] because there were good people there
[1:27:27] went to worship God that
[1:27:36] day I believe
[1:27:40] as while Mary and
[1:27:44] Joseph took the
