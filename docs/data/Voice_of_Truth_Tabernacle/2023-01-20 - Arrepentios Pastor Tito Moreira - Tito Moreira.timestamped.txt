[35:07] hello
[35:19] where are you here
[35:23] [Music]
[35:53] [Music]
[36:03] let us open our Bibles
[36:07] to the book of Acts
[36:10] chapter 2 verse
[36:13] 38.
[36:17] Acts chapter 2 verse
[36:20] good to be in the house of the Lord
[36:24] good to have come have communion with
[36:26] him
[36:40] I desire to receive it amen
[36:44] if you're not in the right attitude it's
[36:46] important
[36:48] to be in the right attitude
[36:55] with the right attitude
[36:57] you come with an incorrect attitude
[37:00] we will receive nothing on behalf of God
[37:03] the good news is that we can change it
[37:08] we can change our attitude
[37:15] is my way of thinking
[37:17] help me this evening
[37:20] to come in a very humble way
[37:23] and sincere with him
[37:28] acts 238 we know this by a memory I
[37:31] believe
[37:32] and if you don't know about it
[37:35] it's a good verse to memorize
[37:50] Acts 2 38 then Peter said unto them
[37:52] repent and be baptized every one of you
[37:55] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[37:56] remission of sins and you shall receive
[37:58] the gift of the Holy Ghost
[38:01] we want to title this message
[38:06] repentios say repent
[38:09] let us pray
[38:11] heavenly father that's the momentum at
[38:13] this moment
[38:14] you want to put ourselves
[38:28] in the communion
[38:33] we can receive what we need foreign
[38:39] repent
[39:07] Pedro Peter
[39:13] believe he was the right person
[39:16] to give that sermon
[39:19] that he gave on that day
[39:22] Pedro Peter savias
[39:25] he knew what it was to repent
[39:31] if you don't know what it was to to
[39:33] carry the sin Center
[39:36] and feel uh guilty is
[39:40] a sermon speaking
[39:43] on who Jesus was
[39:47] he started telling them the history
[39:50] before giving them the medicine
[39:53] he tells them the problem
[39:56] any chance we want to give the medicine
[40:01] or give the answer better you said
[40:05] then put in the questions
[40:20] speaking on them
[40:22] all these Jewish people
[40:26] to tell them who Jesus was
[40:29] and how guilty they were
[40:34] how great of a sin they have committed
[40:36] crucified in crucifying him he
[40:41] is
[40:42] and when they heard this UVO
[40:45] um
[40:47] there was a guilt that came upon their
[40:49] hearts
[40:51] so the Bible says that they were pricked
[40:55] in their hearts
[40:56] now this is very important
[40:59] normally
[41:01] we feel guilt cuando algono is important
[41:06] when something matters to us
[41:08] something doesn't matter to us
[41:11] normally we don't feel guilt
[41:15] before the repentance
[41:18] there comes a guilt
[41:21] I believe one of the reasons
[41:25] there's no revivals
[41:30] where the people Truly Come To The Altar
[41:32] and humble themselves
[41:34] because the people have not repented
[41:38] truly there are many here
[41:40] that we have not repented yes important
[41:45] it's important to come to to the
[41:47] community repented
[41:51] it's important that when we get baptized
[41:55] when we come to the communion as well
[41:59] now the problem we know is
[42:04] the problem is
[42:11] it's unbelief of course
[42:14] but a little bit further on
[42:18] when you study what sin is
[42:23] in the message
[42:28] he says in sin means to miss the marks
[42:31] to Mr Mark
[42:47] because there's something wrong all
[42:49] right
[42:51] now the problem
[42:54] normally with sin is
[42:58] it it brings uh consequences
[43:03] [Music]
[43:06] sin is not evil only because of what
[43:08] what is done
[43:12] but the consequence is that it brings
[43:17] sin brings the consequences of death
[43:21] the Bible says the wages of sin are dead
[43:27] it comes in different manners
[43:30] and one of the things
[43:33] one of the things the sin brings is
[43:37] it's guilt is
[43:40] knowing that you could have done better
[43:49] you're better than what you did
[43:52] it's better than what you thought you
[43:55] are better you are a better person
[43:57] you're a better person
[43:58] [Music]
[44:43] there's a guilt
[44:47] uh
[45:01] gradido they have a transgressed
[45:08] guilt and a shame and a dishonor that
[45:10] comes with it
[45:12] the greatest problem is not is not the
[45:15] sin
[45:16] the greatest problem is what you have
[45:19] it brings
[45:21] see look at today uh
[45:29] no guilt is
[45:34] one of the feelings one of the most
[45:36] experiences of the human experiences
[45:40] one of the most profound human
[45:42] experiences that exists
[45:47] studying a little bit on what the guilt
[45:49] is
[46:34] and affects every area of your life
[46:38] someone carries the guilt
[47:06] people hide
[47:15] hide our sin behind a religion is
[47:27] but yet it is
[47:33] foreign
[48:25] foreign
[49:09] doing what they should truly do
[49:12] that's right brother
[49:13] we try to make excuses of it
[49:17] but the truth is
[49:20] the sin is uh it brings torments
[49:33] I haven't done things
[49:36] because
[49:39] there are times that the biggest critic
[49:41] that there is is the one that's within
[49:42] us
[49:55] [Music]
[50:09] it was so draining
[50:14] he was tormenting her so much
[50:18] that she couldn't bear it any longer
[50:21] so she ran to the feet of Jesus Christ
[50:37] of giving everything she had
[50:41] to to resolve El problem
[50:44] the problem that was within her problem
[50:47] is
[51:12] the only problem
[51:15] she had
[51:18] you could see her
[51:21] she has a very beautiful home she had a
[51:24] beautiful home maybe
[51:26] a very beautiful woman
[51:30] you could say she maybe didn't have a
[51:33] complex
[51:35] everyone thought that maybe she was
[51:37] beautiful
[51:40] she had no sickness
[51:47] she was being tormented
[51:53] there's people that are conscious of
[51:55] their torment and there's people that
[51:56] are not because but sin always torments
[52:15] I believe one of the biggest problems
[52:17] foreign
[52:32] able to repent of them
[52:38] let me tell you
[52:44] many of us
[52:48] we have the we would have
[52:51] or should have
[52:54] I I should have done it
[52:57] I I could have done things different yes
[53:01] and that torment is within us
[53:09] many times we want to make an excuse of
[53:10] it we want to change the story
[53:13] Adam changed the story
[53:19] why are you hiding
[53:22] because the woman that you gave me Lord
[53:26] how we are many times
[53:47] the judging the others
[53:51] of not forgiving
[53:53] because
[53:55] that is a great sin
[53:59] we changed the story
[54:01] our mind changes the story
[54:05] so that we are not the guilty ones
[54:16] how much
[54:19] you heard in your heart
[54:23] is
[54:49] hindering you within
[54:51] foreign
[55:04] of The Sinner
[55:07] they only covered it but they didn't
[55:10] take it away
[55:12] continue feeling guilty say yes
[55:19] they were
[55:26] we make ourselves strong we
[55:53] but no one truly knows
[55:56] of that guilt that we truly carry within
[55:59] us
[56:05] of perhaps maybe stealing
[56:11] I worked your business
[56:14] the brother
[56:17] of maybe betraying someone
[56:24] I've spoken speaking against someone
[56:30] you could just try to justify it all you
[56:32] want to
[56:34] yeah well it's going to be there
[56:38] and it will hinder you yeah
[56:41] Holy Spirit can no longer help you
[56:52] until you deal with that
[56:57] sorry that
[57:00] is
[57:06] we got something we speak
[57:09] it's more weight for us
[57:13] some pencil Mass it's more weight
[57:30] the weight of the act that we committed
[57:34] peso del nino
[57:36] or the the child that died
[57:42] the way of breaking someone's heart
[57:49] that's what
[57:52] that's what sin causes
[57:55] a way within us
[58:09] we could have made another decision
[58:14] what about those sins
[58:17] that we can no longer restore
[58:21] you steal from somebody you can return
[58:23] the money to them
[58:25] there are things that you cannot repair
[58:29] they're just there
[58:35] the peso the weight
[58:38] of the things that cannot be changed
[59:10] tense muscles
[59:13] El nopoder
[59:15] to socialment not being able to be open
[59:18] socially
[59:20] hiding your actions
[59:24] stress
[59:27] stressartanto I'm thinking so much and
[59:31] your secrets
[59:44] especially one
[59:46] a problem
[59:48] the problem that because it cannot be
[59:51] repaired
[59:58] is
[1:00:01] especially when we're our own punishment
[1:00:10] there's nothing
[1:00:12] okay
[1:00:13] it's watching to the internet
[1:00:17] that has not felt
[1:00:20] there's nobody here
[1:00:36] we like to jump
[1:00:43] but we all have something
[1:00:48] like first the people to know
[1:00:52] Bueno
[1:01:43] you look all around till you find where
[1:01:45] you can get good enough then tell me
[1:01:47] where that place is I want to go too
[1:01:50] I said Christ can never came to say good
[1:01:53] man
[1:01:57] you think you're good
[1:02:08] Christ
[1:02:17] there's a line right here
[1:02:21] cigarettes
[1:02:33] you talk about cigarettes
[1:02:36] [Applause]
[1:03:10] in that person of Jesus Christ in order
[1:03:13] to save man
[1:03:14] yes I believe that
[1:03:18] and he died to say sinners like you and
[1:03:21] I then see yes I believe that
[1:03:25] now it's just like this
[1:03:29] we're on one big building here
[1:03:32] and we're in jail
[1:03:35] United scene and I can't start over in
[1:03:37] this corner
[1:03:38] this will help me get out of
[1:03:45] jails
[1:03:52] [Applause]
[1:04:01] he's a renegade to begin with
[1:04:05] someone else
[1:04:26] it was the one that wasn't born
[1:04:32] no matter what he is
[1:04:37] [Applause]
[1:05:33] will take care of themselves
[1:06:32] two things
[1:06:36] forgiveness
[1:06:57] accept your conditions
[1:07:00] before you can face
[1:07:02] The One That Forgives
[1:07:08] no try to excuse me
[1:07:20] this way
[1:07:36] you have to face your sin
[1:07:41] you have to face your sin
[1:07:45] does you know good this is the problem
[1:07:48] with the church in these days with all
[1:07:50] of us
[1:07:53] we come in accepting forgiveness
[1:07:56] well he forgives me
[1:07:58] but you never repented
[1:08:01] you never faced
[1:08:06] we never realized
[1:08:11] in your life
[1:08:16] we didn't get stayed back with what we
[1:08:19] we did
[1:08:21] it didn't stay back with what you did
[1:08:26] the Bible says the Sin Zim follows you
[1:08:30] it catches up to you
[1:08:34] it comes with a dishonor
[1:08:38] the feeling that you could have done
[1:08:40] better
[1:08:45] you try to hide it
[1:08:49] and then it becomes anger
[1:08:51] and you begin to accuse others
[1:08:57] because they haven't been delivered of
[1:08:59] their own sins
[1:09:19] to the soul of man
[1:09:23] amen
[1:09:33] and the tongue critical
[1:09:35] people's so critical we're very critical
[1:09:38] as human beings
[1:09:44] you know why you get so angry
[1:09:49] while we react the way we do
[1:09:54] because there's a weight within us
[1:10:00] you get upset with everything
[1:10:03] we get frustrated
[1:10:05] there's no peace within us
[1:10:10] why because there's a weight in our soul
[1:10:15] doesn't matter how much you've tried
[1:10:19] to ignore it
[1:10:22] nothing will take it away nothing nada
[1:10:25] nothing
[1:10:28] psychology or excuses or your
[1:10:31] justification we're trying to cover it
[1:10:33] or hide it
[1:10:34] nothing takes away that weight
[1:10:41] until you repent
[1:10:44] until you face your sin
[1:10:49] Until you realize you're guilty
[1:10:56] until you come to God and say I'm guilty
[1:11:00] guilty
[1:11:04] we are guilty tell us
[1:11:09] that are in our lives
[1:11:16] it's there in you
[1:11:20] and nothing will undo it
[1:11:23] until you
[1:11:25] understand that you're guilty
[1:11:32] that's why we can't make progress
[1:11:38] Brandon says
[1:11:41] that they criticize him for baptizing
[1:11:43] this man
[1:11:44] because as soon as he got out of the
[1:11:47] water of baptism he went to go smoke
[1:11:55] a few weeks ago I was downstairs
[1:13:21] because we have never faced
[1:13:26] our guilt
[1:13:30] but think to the holy ghost
[1:13:33] that he comes and revealed to us
[1:13:36] and he says you've done this wrong son
[1:13:47] thank me
[1:13:50] he's still knocking at the door

[1:15:07] the only one
[1:15:11] you can take that torment out of her
[1:15:13] heart
[1:15:17] that guilt
[1:15:22] that's why she didn't care about
[1:15:24] anything else
[1:15:26] resolution
[1:16:33] anyone that can help us
[1:16:50] many of us
[1:16:52] we're accepting forgiveness
[1:16:57] without accepting our guilt
[1:17:01] that's not how it works
[1:17:06] come
[1:17:09] here that's why there's no Revival
[1:17:11] Brothers
[1:17:21] accept their obligations of this of sin
[1:17:24] is
[1:17:26] simply just hide it

[1:17:40] but if my people were to Humble
[1:17:41] themselves

[1:19:05] did she feel
