[21:53] me to build him and house at jerusalem
[21:54] which is in judah
[22:08] who is there among you of all his people

[22:13] jerusalem which is in judah and build
[22:14] the house of the lord god of israel he
[22:16] is the god which is in jerusalem
[22:34] and whosoever remaineth in any place
[22:36] where he sojourneth let the men of his
[22:38] place help him with silver and with gold
[22:40] and with goods and with beasts beside
[22:42] the free will offering for the house of
[22:43] god that is in jerusalem
[22:49] jeremiah 27 22.
[23:04] they shall be carried to babylon and
[23:06] there shall they be until the day that i
[23:08] visit them saith the lord and then i

[25:17] [Music]
[26:07] in which they found themselves
[26:10] referring to the children of israel
[26:13] and it continues saying
[26:16] how difficult it was to return
[26:19] listen
[26:21] how difficult it is regresar to return
[26:27] to the place of origin
[26:30] or to the place of our origin
[26:33] after having been exiled
[26:36] for around 70 years
[26:39] 60 years
[26:41] 70 years yes
[26:48] and the last time that i went to mexico
[27:04] i thought that everything
[27:31] and i get there
[27:35] i begin to see many different things
[27:38] many surprises
[27:43] the little ones that i'd left from seven
[27:45] six seven
[27:49] young men of 12 or 13 years old miss
[27:51] padres and my parents
[27:55] you could see
[27:57] el tras
[28:00] how years had gone by for them
[28:03] algo cambiado something had changed in
[28:05] their face in their countenance
[28:08] they were a little more hunched over
[28:12] and the city was no longer the same las
[28:14] cayas
[28:22] [Music]
[28:27] this is
[28:40] themselves
[28:57] the hardest challenge they've ever faced
[29:03] because our pastor says that every
[29:05] anyone can start from ground zero
[29:09] it's easier to do that
[29:39] then to start once again pick up where
[29:41] you left off
[29:42] yes
[29:47] and it's true
[30:34] move or
[30:49] pieces of 25 feet
[30:52] and they're filled with like hey
[30:57] imagine 300 feet
[31:00] and uh to just to make the perimeter
[31:03] roundy
[31:04] fence it off
[31:06] the dirt not leave right
[31:10] and to go and place him is the easy part
[31:14] but when i get there
[31:16] and i see
[31:35] which makes that material that much
[31:37] heavier est
[31:39] and it's filled with dirt
[31:44] and that's what i want
[32:13] yesterday it's already been damaged
[32:18] let's move the or we have to move the
[32:20] dirt that's already uh gone out
[32:23] and that took me like two hours
[32:36] if you can put the images here
[33:06] the second image please
[33:18] on the 6th of august of 1945
[33:25] a bombing aircraft from the u.s
[33:31] drops the first atomic bomb
[33:37] and more than 70 thousand people
[33:41] die instantly
[33:47] this is a part of the city of hiroshima
[34:04] now we can go on to the next image
[34:12] now this is the present-day city of
[34:14] hiroshima
[34:17] is important
[34:31] this is the city of berlin
[34:34] after being bombed
[34:37] the next slide
[34:44] 80 of the city was destroyed
[35:00] now for a moment hitler
[35:02] pensaba he thought
[35:05] of berlin of making the city of berlin
[35:08] la capital mundial the world capital
[35:12] but look at his dream in rena's
[35:15] ruins
[35:18] next slide
[35:23] now this is how it shines now in days
[35:25] in the present day
[35:27] and they are still even rebuilding it
[35:34] and now berlin is one of the most
[35:35] important cities
[35:37] of germany europa of europe
[35:56] perhaps without life
[35:59] a felice not even the most happy
[36:03] not even the most encouraged
[36:05] could have could have given
[36:08] could have placed
[36:24] to construct
[36:26] from the from the ruins
[36:29] why because it's a great labor inaudib
[36:52] and give
[37:06] when
[37:20] amen
[38:03] de dios as an instrument of the grace of
[38:05] god
[38:06] she was sent
[38:08] to to occupy the throne of
[38:11] god
[38:16] and she moved the heart of the king her
[38:17] husband
[38:19] who allowed quenemias nehemiah su pero
[38:23] her her
[38:24] her cupbearer vulvira
[38:26] returned to jerusalem
[38:29] name is
[38:44] of babylon
[38:47] and now
[38:49] um a true overcomer
[38:53] constructs
[38:54] over the ruins
[38:56] these men esdras ezra
[39:25] when they get there
[39:40] have
[39:41] [Music]
[39:53] are the ones that are willing
[39:56] to
[39:56] are the ones that are motivated
[39:58] and do it out of love
[40:03] all the men of this church
[40:05] for the women
[40:08] do the
[40:32] faith by experience
[41:02] [Music]
[41:08] if there's if anything that christ could
[41:09] not use in his kingdom
[41:11] would be a coward
[41:14] we see here
[41:17] he said have faith in god
[42:44] they would have taken hope
[42:47] on getting to jerusalem
[42:52] that that hope would have been
[42:54] but it was affected
[42:56] it was a lot
[43:22] rather than look for cowards
[43:59] [Music]
[44:20] over
[44:34] but he prefers
