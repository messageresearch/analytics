amen foreign [Music] six better yet let's start from verse 5. chapter 1 verse 5. now we're talking about the first coming of the Lord and it says in a in the coming manner you said no contraya and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it's not there was a man sent from God whose name was John Estes the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not the light but was sent to Bear witness of the light let's go to the book of Isaiah chapter 40 verse three to five Isaiah 40 verse 3 this is in the following manner and it is the force of him that Christ in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for our God a hello every Valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hail shall be made low and the crooks shall be made straight and the rough Place plain let us power our heads to pray blessed and glorious Heavenly Father give you thanks in this morning for the privilege that you give us so being able to listen to this precious word you anoint the lips are going to speak and you see the need of your people and see what they are needing off through your word father uh that you Lord be glorified in this morning we give you thanks for all so that you may be ingratened yeah we ask all of this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean amen you you may be seated Brethren uh as a title Alex brother Alex alongside me uh we put from Darkness to lights now we're going to talk about what is a forerunner his message amen he was the Forerunner of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen but we see that when he sent someone else he always prepares that man he always separates him he never has them with the punches because he has to make a separation I believe we have been separated each and every one of us every individual here in circular Greek the term was frequently as as a military term for advanced scouts or Calvary that prepared for a Full Assault I mean amen amen Brothers forerunners is used to metaphorically for the first ripe fruits this usually suggests that the Christian hope of entering God's presence is guaranteed by the Forerunner already reaching this goal I don't know if you're capturing this a foreign Jesus Christ let us continue reading ideas a similar ideas expressed in the image of Christ as a pioneer of salvation the first of many children that God brings to Glory through suffering significant significant significantly Christ is Forerunner for us having run ahead on the road of suffering Christ became the source of Salvation that makes our following possible in English foreign and the people had to be in a certain conditions that's where God prepared him a place in which I can say truly was lonely I could imagine John asked himself why am I here I could imagine many of you asked yourself the same question because God prepares his people a complete Saint person there has to be a complete separation [Music] because he's a jealous God Brothers the scripture shows me here um what the message that John had in Isaiah 40 . this is every Valley shall be exalted Every Mountain and Hills shall be made low and the Crooked shall be made straight and The Rock Place is plain no message in which John had [Music] and the Pharisees were bringing in those days that's what I believe amen amen in this life is no I believe that people believe there's disadvantages they say well I'm poor oh the rich man has more advantages because he has more than me bought this message is made to make things even your poverty Aquino important it does not matter to God we have a good home I know in Portland if you have education let's do even things out amen amen God comes here and brings them down [Applause] I'm sorry oh girl that's what I believe whoever you can obtain it here amen amen amen amen you're looking over Manos I believe her brothers the prophet says the great king and Prince sorry and King this is hope we have Christ The Foreigner has already come this is [Music] you know what a forerunner is something that runs before or goes ahead in the foreign after he had completed his sacrifice on Calvary Calvary you see it he said nothing this is nothing now he says he was born in humility in a Manger he was made fun of us anyone else who serves him this is a person respect the person he loves it is [Applause] John was a foreign he goes ahead [Applause] [Music] come on Amen the question is will you suffer with him that's something one should one should think in the message you throw one that John brought came to declare Jesus we see Juan where John went we see when God sends them to his ministry he sends them to the people of that day he didn't go through the big cities [Music] you know the Jordan River significance I don't believe amen Brothers I'm going to be finishing now you know the message that John brought it's not very popular especially with the religious people of that day in itself this message John said in the scripture the ax is put on the roots this message came to decapitate amen amen you know what this message came to do is you know that all of us tear down our heads how many times I have the message they say Hermanos Brothers all right you have the message now the question is [Applause] Jesus Christ the word amen that's what I believe this message came to cut off heads people that thought they knew I know we don't know Jesus a man came to Jesus called Nicodemus Jesus and I believe when he saw all the Wonders that God did maybe he thoughts I want one yes I believe that we have that type of mentality draws near to Jesus and Jesus says to him it is necessary to be born again in few words it's worth nothing it doesn't look good Brothers the question is do you have him amen amen one John here in darkness but he had said separated many yes yes many kids are scared of the dark is it because you have no head possible foreign entered into prison before going in what he was doing had a plan is when they put them into darkness prison God bless you [Applause] Hallelujah God bless you in this precious morning look Luke chapter 10 verse 21 . we're happy to be in this place in this morning talking about the coming of the Lord said and we're going to talk about Darkness to light apocalypse Luke chapter 10 verse 21 where once you have it you can say with the name man this is the word of God says in the coming manner Espiritu foreign Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudence and has revealed them unto babies even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight Okay add blessings unto his word throughout time God has never revealed himself to a great punch religios religious groups God has always revealed himself to individuals you may ask yourself this in this morning why doesn't God reveal to himself to Great multitude religious systems Grande wouldn't that be something greater wouldn't God be able to take the message disperse his message apparently it would seem that there will be more benefits could you imagine yourself walking through to the temple presenting himself to the priest and saying to them behold I have come to the city can you imagine the high priests and say okay [Applause] let's see how this situation is will come and presenting himself as Christ the Messiah can you imagine yourself with different ideas that would come out of that place it would be something terrible foreign is that we like to reason things sir dios no puede God cannot ariasgar risk etos giving up his secrets to a great group of people do you know analyzes certain things Jesus Christ to start off foreign why [Applause] to start off Supreme amen because God cannot risk one of the reasons why God is very careful because God has secrets that's fine secrets imagine yourself to you his secrets mysterious and you're not having the capacity of being able to to to go through those secrets the prophets a forerunner big secrets do you remember the first time I wanted to speak with his people is fast don't you don't know you're wrong let's go prepare ourselves let's go keep ourselves oh sorry on the mysteries of God stop being touched by humans foreign God can take one man in his hands organization he doesn't deal organization he doesn't deal with the organization he deals with you hey Matt stretcher amen God has many Mysteries the new birth is a mystery is Christ the minister the mystery of God then what is the new birth you may say November listen now it's a question is it's a

a mystery the way he came amen several years a virgin coach shall conceived that's right that's right he didn't even know what he was talking about God what God wants him to say look what brother Brown says I like this quote which they sent for me if I can find it God rebuked the devil the oncoming storms many times Vision say things we don't know what they are the prophet speaking churches say things we don't know what they are the prophets they just wrote it and they were Vindicated men inspired I see these elements that's what the message says Church mysterious Mysteries is one of the greatest Mysteries the coming of the Lord I want to leave you with this when God came the first time God had to keep yes and hide his mystery of his coming because the devil cannot put his Filthy Hands in their Church even yet still that is look what the devil wanted to do when Jesus was a baby he moves by instincts wow I'm going to leave you with this the devil is like an animal German my
