capitolo john chapter 21 we'll be reading verse 15 16 and 17. 15 16 and 17. so when they had dying jesus said to simon peter simon simon son of jonas love is tell me more than these senor tusaves he said unto him yeah lord thou knowest that i love thee he says unto me feed my lambs he said to him again the second time simon son of jonas love is thou me pedro [Music] peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time love is now me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus jesus saith unto him feed my sheep restoring our relationship with god is not only caressing and kisses i our blood flowing in our veins love is fulfilled the strength you face any situation face any challenge [Music] is [Music] himself to the disciples and amongst them simon peter who were fishing yesterday and this is their first conversation between jesus and peter pedro after peter denied him thrice i imagine a conversation is long and hard for peter imagine the person that gave us their back when we needed them the most person but that person i said was willing for everything but in the most defining moment he didn't even say he knew us but see how beautiful is the lord because jesus did not sit to speak with peter to uh complain jesus christ [Applause] [Music] [Applause] how curious the same amount of times how curious las mismas basis the same amount of times that peter denied him three times he denied him these were the three that they're crucifying his face was never the same he was afraid he was fearful for a moment they didn't know anything of him he wanted to go back to fish maybe he didn't want to continue with this commission what's the point [Music] [Applause] jesus [Music] and peter heard the most wonderful words that anyone that has failed can hear in juan mention in john 21 19 yes this speak he's signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this see me he saith unto him follow me in other words pedro peter important it doesn't matter that you deny me thrice that you said you didn't know me continue get up no important amen thank you see what ecclesiastes 3 15 says that which hath been yes is now eloquently that's right [Music] see what our brother branham says the return of the sun to restore what the winner killed cuando gets away from the s-o-n son where this is the s-u-n see what it says but when this earth begins to come back i live preserve and as soon as the sun gets back in position and position with the earth again there's an easter egg a restoration stores [Music] then god will restore also his habitation [Music] what does the return of the sun do enforcer the forces listen the spring sun comes back in line of the earth again it actually forces death to give up its death to a resurrection okay for what a restoration [Music] but the moment comes when the son of god recognizes realizes that he is in the conditional condition damaged conditions and needs that spring son puerto to strike him again [Music] the time comes when peter i'll [Applause] [Music] they could heal the sick [Applause] and then 5 000. [Music] [Applause] yes decisions can come [Music] [Applause] [Music] wants us to get away no they say nobody's not houses you're not worth anything look you denied him take your life because he loved us first [Music] he already restored everything everything that had been lost [Music] but now it's our turn [Music] he tells me eric do you love me what's that i say do you love me [Music] my children [Music] so go into the high place does it matter if [Music] by not seeing my brother's condition when i judge my own people but he says do you love me it's time to return god bless you [Music] foreign

[Music] and he's going to let us know what god is doing through them amen my brother tabernacle uh on behalf of the gideon's international thank you for having me today departed the uh international gracious portugal so church who are these men and women the gideon's international and with our wives at the auxiliary los angeles internationales esposas como assistantes since 1899 have been bound together with our churches as a missionary group to the world common group currently we have gideon camps in 200 countries and our testaments are printed in a hundred and nine languages and our mission is sharing the gospel with the world we are sharing the gospel and over 12 000 individual locations in the world we call camps three thousand in the u.s tres mills los estados unidos and over nine thousand in the rest of the world and el reso del mundo we have camps in russia tenemos campamento several years ago the director of gideon's in russia came and spoke to our international convention he said the government had stopped the gideon babbles from coming into the country they went to court and the border is again open to allow our bibles to come in and they are still coming in today because jesus commanded us to preach the gospel in judea and judea and samaria and the uttermost part of the earth isaiah 55 11 is says so shall my word be deceptive it shall not return unto me foreign but shall accomplish that which i please and prosper in the thing where to ascended church in june of 2019 i was blessed to be chosen as part of a gideon international scripture blitz to peru iglesias internationales i had to go through a lot of preparation before going to preparation i had to have a medical checkup and i had to get shots that i hadn't had before i had to have my last permission you think that was easy i had to send money ahead to help with the logistics for moving a hundred thousand bibles and testaments from one place to another mandarin video my itinerary was a 19-hour trip from denver to peru i would meet other gideons in dallas and we would go together for the rest of the trip well god as he often does had other plans i went to denver for the first leg of my trip and a big thunderstorm was affecting traffic in oklahoma the plane coming from me was cancelled well what do i do now anton says i've been planning this trip for six months i know my plans were out the windows so after a wait i finally got to an agent who said we can get you to peru through miami in other words my trip was now 48 hours so when i finally got on the plane from miami to lima ecuador miami lima sitting next to me was a well-dressed businessman from peru who spoke better english than i do i was prompted by the holy spirit to offer him a spanish testament el espiritu santo mejo que lo fresiera un testamento en espanol he said he wanted an english one to help him with his english i said you don't need that you speak very good english he said he wanted it to help with the big words i gave him one and soon noticed he was thumbing through the gps are god's plan of salvation in the back of the gideon testament [Music] it tells you how to meet jesus this is where you come in help me to stay out of it and not mess it up i also prayed that he was reading dear jesus i know i am a sinner jesus i believe you died on the cross at my place please come into my heart right then alfonso took out his pen and signed his name in the back of the gideon testament accepting jesus as his savior jesus [Music] if i hadn't been on the wrong plane alfonso wouldn't have met jesus that day alfonso novera encontrado or conocido jesus suddenly i wasn't concerned about the long trip and i knew god's plan was more important than my inconvenience important peru is a city with a population of nearly 500 000 located in northwestern peru localization was the first city in peru established by the spaniards seventy-six percent of peruvians are catholic says [Music] and they believe that good works are what is needed to get to heaven next slide please it is in these circumstances that members of the gideon international were called to share the gospel of our lord jesus christ in pura peru forever so i finally got to pura on sunday around 11 a.m finalemente mingo a la sonsa de la manana we met our translators and our team the next morning each of the international gains were signed to a team with an interpreter and two or three peruvian gideons we went to work going to classrooms universities police stations fire stations and to prison universidades [Music] myself and three peruvian gideons went to a catholic school that we thought we had permission to go to when we arrived the director said no you can wait until 12 30 when the students get out and see them outside on the sidewalk foreign since it was only 8 a.m and there were other things we could be doing i asked the peruvian gideons to call the local organizer to find another place we could go and not waste our time fortunately they took a different approach and call someone and they convince the director to allow us in and to let us give out bibles in each classroom director so now we are allowed to go into classrooms we could hand out bibles but not witness either vividly and we are escorted by none other than the director himself escorted nadia director mismo after we had done almost all the classrooms the director said we could speak in one class it was a senior class with all the older students i spoke through my interpreter joel about when we were children we sometimes tell something that is not true to our parents to our brothers and sisters or to our friends amigos and how we sometimes take something which we know is not ours from our brothers or our sisters or our friends or questions them no one taught them how to do this we were born with it it is built in esta compuesto por dentro i asked them who put that inside of us psalms 58 3 tells us the wicked are estranged from the womb telling lies says i said we could do nothing ourselves because we are all born with a sin nature. because it comes from satan and the only way to overcome him was jesus i asked for a show of hands who had already accepted jesus and sarah will raise their hands the whole time i was speaking beside me i then had my interpreter speak this press the interpreter who's a very young gideon and a good soul winner and he presented god's plan of salvation in their language when he finished he had the students that wanted to recite after him the sinner's prayer estudiantes as i look to my left voltami the director was reciting along with the students he had accepted jesus after leaving the class especially we all congratulated him on his decision [Music] received the big christian brotherly hug cristiano it was a god-ordained moment that day church iglesia it was a pleasure to partner with you in sharing the gospel es un placer thank you pastor tito gracias pastor tito for standing for christ and letting us join you today on [Applause] so [Music] [Music] normally they stay a few minutes afterwards if they have any questions or anything um and we thank god [Music] for taking care of me and my family [Music] and thank you for your prayers [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i take control of everything miguel brother miguel uh [Music] the same petition that god delivered him from an accident this morning kept them safe amen [Music] i know there's going to be a few going out to california this weekend that's [Music] a lovely lord [Music] who shall we go to the only you that has eternal words of eternal life [Music] we have heard the thanksgiving our brother for that fast that they did it with reverence may you continue to bless them and continue to help them and also for our brother eric that he's going to be going to mexico on tuesday it may be you helping them and when you bring them back safely [Music] you help them as soon as you see that and there is no needs i'm plainly believing that you're the one that answers our cry like a calling calling another calling the one that restores our joy that gives us our health and that helps us in our economy the one that gives us because today is a new day and we came out victorious by your word lord [Music] [Music] may we be a living bible lord help us to be better may it be you with us leaving this place may you never depart from us may you bless them in the name of our lord jesus christ amen [Music] the time continues brothers [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
