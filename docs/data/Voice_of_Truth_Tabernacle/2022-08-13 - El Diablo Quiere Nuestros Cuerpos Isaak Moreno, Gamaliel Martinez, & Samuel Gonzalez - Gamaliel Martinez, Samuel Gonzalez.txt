[Music] hey man we see moses here we see him he tells us we're not going to have to make a sacrifice he's like just leave your flocks here leave your flocks here when you go back home leave your flocks we're too ashamed to come to the altar a lot of the times and it's it and he says moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and bear offerings amen see god doesn't want you the way you are veg and you see a lot of the times even muchas versus how i was reading how sometimes we're cowards and the devil uses us because we're too ashamed to serve god amen show our gifts i i don't believe yeah alex and he says it is a you have a you have choices god will not make all of our choices if we want to be in church it's because it's our choice but god doesn't want you unhappy here in church if you want to if you want to go smoke you want to go drink it you want to go parties you want to go cuss whatever you want to do [Applause] what a very good job my brother isaac did it in which we placed in this episode it's because it's the closing characteristic of the character moses so the subject or interest in me because we're going to re-read jude chapter one verse nine once again brothers yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bringing bringing against him and reeling accusation but said the lord rebuked thee look brothers we see here uh you can ask or start to question yourself why did the devil want the body of moses [Applause] it's not 100 certain but historians from back then i like what the historians said they said the devil wanted the body of moses for one simple reason because he wanted to raise them up because he knew barrios that several barrios with a false spirit man right that's what the historian said [Music] so why the title the devil wants your body youth el diablo the devil wants this body for those motivos and so you 100 sure god's going to use is of the lord died in the land of moab according to the word of the lord and he buried him in a valley in in a valley in the land of moa over against the devil claims or fought for the body of moses for two arguments [Applause] tries tries to keep your bodies in first corinthians chapter 6 verse 19 it says what no ye not that your body is the temple of the of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and you are not of your of your peace this body is not about that's the reason why the lord jesus christ takes care of us what protects us for ye are bought with a price therefore glorifying god in your body and in your spirit which are gods los cuales which are gods figures which are gods because he knows that we will fail in 1955 1005. i can connect it this way do not ignore that your body is the temple of the lord jesus christ the believer with the holy ghost until they're so soaked full they're not they're they're not full of themselves anymore they're not full of themselves anymore then she can blunt the waves bump against the logs and knock them out of the way but keep going on hallelujah do not ignore that your part is the temple of the lord jesus christ i'm going to put it in this way oh semester like a brother isaac be soaked with that it doesn't matter if that pitch breaks a couple times saying you got the position you understand that's right puts things in what do you want to withhold in your body that right those many of those that did not want to pay attention to the advice of bosses he was with them they would have been in danger of committing adultery idolatry with their dead body the the statue of the ox if i if he had known where he was buried uh if the the body of moses had been gay by the waves we he has to cast out all things all things idolatry enojo anger depression depression whatever you want to cast all that out youth [Applause] god bless you our god noise fulfills his promises amen if you could please open your bibles to deuteronomy 34 verse 4. and it says like this dc and the lord said unto him this is the land which i swear unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob i have caused thee to see you with thine eyes but thou shalt not go over it 5 so moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab according to the word of the lord verse 6 and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab over against beth but no man knoweth of his simple tree unto this day logarithm i want all the youth to understand where he reaches the top of mount pisgah and god shows him the front of jericho and he shows him all the promised lands you will not be his because there was no reason for moses to strike that wrong okay god knows what he is doing you see it god wanted to take him to another level but because of letting himself get carried away pero porque and to this day nobody knows where the grave of moses is but i want to express something before giving details of moses we know that moses was one of the greatest leaders and i believe that moses was one of the greatest men shown in the bible you see moses left the great legacy the whole grand legato and we all know it also that moses did die but he did not die a coward he did not die leaving it like a sad story no because this they say and moses calls unto joshua and said unto him in the sight of all israel israel be strong and of good courage thou must go with these people into the land which the lord has sworn unto their fathers and thou shalt cause them to inherit and the lord he it is that doth you see the new testament in jude it shows us that after moses died of moses because the angel of the lord disputed 1957. moses was never absent no his body was packed away the angels took him los angeles he did not mortified he did not corrupt you see moses was a good leader family says the with the simplicity of just looking at his body simplicidade solo versus it looks like the life of moses is sad in the end it's like for an example for example it's like my father telling me you see when there was the great transfiguration in matthew 17. moses appeared in the great transfiguration i want to explain something and i want you all to listen carefully you see why did moses appear in the great transfiguration is that moses always pointed towards jesus whatever the bible says that he was the type of christ he would always point out to jesus who will be greater than was the one that he spoke of now we are speaking in the time of jesus and the jewish people there in that time we're with the law of moses so now moses needs to return and prove to the jewish people not to say this is parallel i could say this is one there was the ditch you see number two the wife of part of the las posada trapping brothers amen amen you see god fulfills his promises you see everything in the bible is parallel with the purpose in the end you see the is my but god knows more and what god brings to us you see romans 12 2 romano's and be not confirmed to this world nos conforma [Music] you the devil wants to destroy our families from what matters to us you see the the devil diablo i want to give an example my pastor is here as a witness look at god look at how god took care of our pastors look at how god has prepared our past and that's why he is here [Music] and you know bad things come to me so bad if it feels traumatizing let me be honest i've fallen many of the times hoveness let us not get comfortable i believe that in this church yeah god wants to prepare who will rise up just like moses i see come on just like just like joseph jose just like our prophets like our pastor and youth we are the coming generation and god wants what [Applause] amen amen we have a purpose here we all have gifts but the devil is here to destroy them you see the devil does it rest we shouldn't serve god with our knowledge don't be embarrassed don't think i'm better once don't [Music] [Applause] this world only brings temporary things yesterday will pass at some point the old generation will pass and the new generation will have to rise what legacy will you need tonight which is why i doesn't [Music] what god has for us give your bodies to the lord and tell the lord god take my body [Music] just give your bodies to them and accept what he has for you this this to earth this outside fuera will give you no won't give you god [Music] he deserves the glory
