[27:32] throne of god jesus
[27:40] christ
[27:46] and we'll go to luke chapter 2 verse 26
[27:55] and it reads like this this i see
[27:59] and it was revealed unto him by the holy
[28:01] ghost
[28:03] that he should not see death
[28:04] before he had seen the lord's christ

[28:20] morning lord
[28:24] for your love and your goodness
[28:27] and the mercy you show uh to us every
[28:29] every day
[28:32] we asked you you would speak to your
[28:33] people father
[28:37] efforts that they made lord senor van
[28:38] dierer
[28:40] uh to uh come to your house father
[28:43] veneras
[28:44] that you would just speak to their
[28:46] hearts
[28:49] you would just supply their needs
[28:53] because that's why we come here lord
[29:08] [Music]
[29:13] and that you would just anoint the lips
[29:14] that are speaking
[29:18] you would be with my interpreter as well
[29:22] and at the end of the service
[29:24] may
[29:28] the name of our lord jesus christ
[29:31] amen amen uh you may be seated brothers
[29:37] uh for a title common
[29:50] and just for a thought
[29:54] waiting for that day esperando el dia
[29:59] you know uh
[30:02] just kind of reading a little bit on
[30:04] simeon
[30:07] when i first started reading the message
[30:09] of the hour
[30:12] elements
[30:14] i would read quite a bit
[30:16] and i always found that brother branham
[30:32] he preached it it seemed like
[30:44] you know why he talked about these these
[30:46] older folks
[30:58] you know there's not a whole lot said
[30:59] about them in the bible
[31:15] they were people that were waiting
[31:19] there were people that were expecting
[31:21] personas
[31:23] and you know i think that's how we
[31:24] should come to the house of the lord
[31:28] you know we should come to the house of
[31:29] the lord expecting
[31:58] they
[32:42] amen amen
[32:45] but when we expect something
[32:49] i believe that uh not only do you do
[32:51] should you expect it
[32:54] is
[33:07] when we expect something
[33:12] oh you know you have to you have to
[33:13] prepare for it
[33:16] you see because your preparation
[33:19] i will determine your expectations
[33:50] you see because
[34:45] [Music]
[34:53] i just haven't been able to quite get
[34:55] away from this scripture
[35:00] i don't have it on there
[35:02] got it
[35:03] he talks about el avla he he this is the
[35:07] calling of abraham now
[35:11] and we uh we know that that he called
[35:14] abraham
[35:27] [Music]
[35:28] i will show you
[35:32] i will make you a great nation
[35:35] i will make you a blessing
[35:39] you see i will make i i will make you a
[35:42] great of nation
[35:46] pueblo you see he just keeps saying aye
[35:48] aye
[35:51] and that's it's it's not abraham talking
[35:52] here you know
[35:54] but it's god
[35:56] you see when i
[36:08] i will make you a great name
[36:24] i
[36:50] amen amen
[36:52] yes
[37:05] amen
[37:08] you see many times
[37:10] you know throughout our lives
[37:13] we are expecting esperamos oh great
[37:16] things
[37:18] grandes
[37:21] but there's so much uh disappointments
[37:26] we get very disappointed
[37:33] and you know we should probably ask
[37:35] ourselves
[37:38] why aren't our expectations met
[37:41] no ramos
[37:44] why didn't why why weren't the
[37:45] expectations meant
[37:48] you see those are all the questions that
[37:50] we should ask ourselves
[37:57] because if we prepared right
[38:00] if we had the right attitude
[38:15] oh you know the outcome
[38:51] [Music]
[38:56] you may be disappointed with your why
[39:10] and his name is jesus christ
[39:37] he has given me more mercy hello
[39:46] [Applause]
[39:54] we prepare for it
[39:57] you know i i i look around
[40:00] you know and i you know brother tito was
[40:02] saying last week
[40:07] you know how there's just a lot of
[40:09] love going around in the air okay
[40:15] and that's okay yes
[40:17] we need we all need love
[40:22] the greatest love we need
[40:25] you know before any other kind of love
[40:29] it's the love of jesus
[40:31] amen amen
[40:33] i uh
[40:34] i was just kind of meditating on that
[40:36] solos
[40:41] you know they're with great expectations
[40:45] you know and i mean i i would be too
[40:47] yo
[40:49] yeah you know you'd be expecting great
[40:51] things
[40:53] uh but
[40:56] before
[40:58] anything goes down
[41:01] uh you know there has to be a
[41:02] preparation
[41:04] preparation
[41:05] we have we prepare we prepare for
[41:07] everything
[41:08] it seems like
[41:10] you know
[41:11] except for coming to church
[41:16] i promise this is going to be an
[41:17] encouraging message
[42:00] i'm
[42:13] you know the boxing night seems like
[42:15] it's saturday night
[42:18] el salvador
[42:20] back when i was growing up it wasn't so
[42:21] much the ufc
[42:24] but it was it was boxing
[42:26] you see and they and the devil just
[42:28] always trying to beat god to the punch
[42:33] he's like you know i'm a traitor he's
[42:34] gonna try and stop it
[42:38] you know and you know they they just
[42:40] kind of hype up the match hey come on
[42:55] just kind of look at each other and they
[42:56] put them face to face
[43:00] and then all of a sudden they get back
[43:01] and they swing
[43:03] you know and they're just going at each
[43:04] other and everybody's trying to hold
[43:06] them back
[43:09] you see that they're hyping up to five
[43:38] you
[44:34] of this
[44:48] i love you i am your great and exceeding
[44:51] reward
[44:53] compensation and that's who i'm running
[44:55] today
[44:56] that's who i'm looking for
[44:59] the one that called me
[45:01] he's the one that will help me
[45:16] he would not
[45:26] amen
[45:27] [Applause]
[45:31] you amen call us to be spectators
[45:39] i don't like watching people you know
[45:41] enjoy themselves
[45:44] fruity
[45:54] you're just praising god and you know
[45:55] god is just blessed
[46:10] that we won't always be able to praise
[46:12] like somebody else
[46:16] well you know i i want a piece of that
[46:18] but
[46:20] oh i want a piece of jesus
[46:22] and he's willing to give you a piece of
[46:24] him
[46:26] you're willing
[46:50] but you know i'm always you know maybe
[46:52] just like they give me a piece
[47:09] that opportunity
[47:11] you know and i think that that's what we
[47:13] should have
[47:15] we should have a piece of jesus
[47:19] you see that the people out there
[47:21] that the people out there in the world
[47:25] would just have that desire
[47:28] oh you know to just to just have what
[47:31] you have that's solo
[47:33] you know what they would say
[48:04] and if we don't have it
[48:33] day
[48:36] is the moment that it would be right now
[48:40] that every time you came
[48:43] but then it was not invaded
[48:46] i thought you were building
[48:58] oh because because you were prepared
[49:00] more for it
[49:03] we have to prepare for the blessings
[49:07] amen amen come on brother free come on
[49:11] amen
[49:12] i'm in
[49:18] when there's preparation
[49:22] i want you to know
[49:25] that it
[49:29] that it proves just a sensation
[49:33] amen
[49:34] amen
[49:35] amen
[49:37] that's exactly what it proves let's look
[49:39] at brother
[49:40] uh because when you get excited about
[49:43] something
[49:45] uh you know you you are you should
[49:47] prepare for it
[49:49] you should prepare for it
[49:52] i read one time
[49:54] uh you somebody i i can't remember who
[49:56] it was
[50:08] then that's what god has to do
[50:25] caring for your children
[50:27] he's going to see how you where how
[50:29] you're acting in your pose of duty
[50:33] he's going to see how you're teaching
[50:34] those little kids
[50:58] i want to read a quote from brother
[51:00] branham
[51:03] and he says this
[51:08] it's in the message who is this
[51:14] este he says you know unusually where we
[51:16] have services
[51:29] it says you know and usually where we
[51:31] have services
[51:33] we have our regular service and do our
[51:34] worship
[51:46] and fellowship with our people
[52:30] that know nothing
[52:57] of the world
[53:11] and knowing there's something special
[53:25] unless something special does take place
[53:29] there's always something new when he
[53:31] appears
[53:34] and they were charged with expectations
[53:38] oh i hope
[53:40] i hope
[54:08] oh
[54:20] that's one of the sad things about today
[54:34] there will be those who know god
[54:40] [Applause]
[54:49] you know god knows it
[54:52] and he knows it because he knows you've
[54:54] prepared for him
[54:56] he knows you've studied
[54:59] he knows that you've done the word
[55:02] he knows you know about him
[55:13] because you lived like he wanted you to
[55:14] live but
[55:17] he knows who you are
[55:45] i had great expectations
[55:49] and i hope that you have the same kind
[55:50] of expectations
[55:54] i don't want to just house
[55:55] normal expectations
[55:59] you see normal expectations
[56:16] i would not listen to this kind of
[56:17] message one more time would not listen
[56:20] to this kind of message
[56:23] this message is not normal
[56:26] he did not goes to be average
[56:57] so
[56:58] we like it
[57:00] we run like this
[57:08] i believe it you look real my
[57:10] expectations are great
[57:13] he promised us
[57:16] they promised me
[57:18] oh i'd say me yo they go
[57:21] because the promise is individual
[57:24] this
[57:27] [Applause]
[58:30] you know sister daniela's a testimony
[58:33] testimony
[58:44] and
[58:46] i remember her saying
[59:01] that she felt like her heart was going
[59:02] to come out
[59:08] you know and i think that uh
[59:11] that's how we should run this kind of
[59:13] race
[59:16] carrera
[59:34] oh you should keep going
[59:36] you know when things get harder
[59:40] you know you you should you you should
[59:41] know
[59:43] that god is
[59:46] in order to get you in the right
[59:47] condition
[59:50] this race
[59:53] i want to let you know
[59:55] that this race is not to the swift
[59:58] go to ecclesiastes nine verse eleven
[1:00:00] sierra clastes
[1:00:03] nine verse eleven
[1:00:05] capitol nueve versicolo
[1:00:08] the words of solomon
[1:00:11] he says this
[1:00:40] to them
[1:01:08] is but they have missed the greatest
[1:01:12] gifts
[1:01:14] they have not found favor with god
[1:01:18] that's what he says
[1:01:21] that the race is not to the swift
[1:01:50] and i believe
[1:02:59] and you have to keep working you gotta
[1:03:02] keep persevering
[1:03:04] but you gotta keep running
[1:03:07] and you gotta keep pulling
[1:03:10] you gotta keep working you say love it
[1:03:12] but nobody else follows
[1:03:42] i want to read one more one more quote
[1:03:46] um
[1:03:51] he says this in the message uh christ is
[1:03:53] revealed in his own word
[1:03:56] and el mensah
[1:03:59] he says
[1:04:01] the thing that's the matter with the
[1:04:02] message today is
[1:04:04] okay
[1:04:08] those who obtain it in their hearts
[1:04:13] must lay in the presence of the sun to
[1:04:16] get ripened
[1:04:20] says you can pick up the message
[1:04:25] and then let the sun bake all the
[1:04:27] greenness out of you
[1:04:31] make you mature christians
[1:04:34] cristianos maduros he says you see what
[1:04:36] i mean
[1:04:52] it says the weeds got to get ripe
[1:04:57] all right
[1:04:58] and you know i believe yo
[1:05:03] that if we want to see
[1:05:30] it has to have the sun
[1:05:33] you see and when you have the sun
[1:05:37] you know when you're in the presence of
[1:05:38] the sun
[1:05:40] you see that's why i said in the
