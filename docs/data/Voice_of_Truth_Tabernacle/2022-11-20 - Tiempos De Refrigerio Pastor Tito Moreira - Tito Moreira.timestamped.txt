[26:05] chapter 3 verse
[26:09] 19 and um
[26:15] thankful with him amen
[26:19] how many can say I love you Lord
[26:25] is the best from us this morning
[26:28] and we want to give you the best
[26:33] Acts 3 verse 19.
[26:37] Acts 3 verse 19.
[26:44] ie
[26:49] repent you therefore and be converted
[26:52] that your sins may be blotted out when
[26:54] the times of refreshing shall come from
[26:56] the presence of the Lord
[27:00] we'll be speaking with our title times
[27:03] of refreshing yeah
[27:08] go ahead and he shall send Jesus Christ
[27:11] which before was preached unto you again
[27:25] whom the Heaven Must receive until the
[27:27] times of restitution of all things which
[27:29] God hath spoken by the mouth of all his
[27:31] holy prophets since the world began
[27:34] foreign
[28:34] foreign
[30:18] this is the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:23] now we're speaking that she is a broken
[30:25] bride
[30:28] but we're also speaking that God
[30:31] repeat God has the medicine
[30:48] speaking of the times of restitution of
[30:50] all things
[30:56] it's speaking about
[31:42] the second coming of the Lord how many
[31:46] are waiting foreign
[32:20] for her
[33:30] from any type of illness
[33:34] foreign
[35:32] so you
[36:33] brethren
[37:36] I believe that the word refreshing here
[37:39] is
[37:41] more than just food
[37:44] what the word means here is
[37:48] that he will send time of Aid or help
[37:53] times of Hell
[37:56] how many of us need help
[38:00] is
[39:57] out of the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:00] amen
[41:05] is looking for a place to rest
[41:10] foreign
[41:56] do not benefit them why foreign
[42:16] to relax
[42:17] [Music]
[42:20] yeah worry that nervousness
[42:28] now look
[42:30] at this is
[42:32] Revelation 3 17 says
[42:39] I'm rich and increase with goods and
[42:41] have need of nothing
[42:46] no it's not Thou Art wretched and
[42:50] miserable and poor and blind and naked
[42:54] yes
[42:55] la
[42:57] is that the age of vladesia
[43:01] Refugio they find their own refuge in
[43:05] quentinence they find their own help in
[43:08] Las Casas Este Mundo and the things of
[43:11] this world
[43:17] that's the difference between the the
[43:19] bride and the foolish or the Church of
[43:21] this age
[43:22] because the bride no pueden contrary
[43:26] cannot find that help in religion in
[43:29] religion in Iglesias in churches
[43:33] only come to church so often
[44:27] what they want
[44:29] is
[45:29] foreign
[46:04] the signaling angel
[46:06] estaba buscando
[46:08] a personas was looking for people that
[46:11] were groaning
[46:14] we were in the denomination
[46:16] and we were grown in porque located
[46:58] [Music]
[47:33] a living life
[47:35] that's right amen
[47:41] the Bible says that the children of God
[47:44] are groaning in themselves
[47:51] God didn't call you
[47:54] just to be a Christian
[47:56] in a church
[47:58] God didn't call you
[48:01] yes
[48:05] but God called you
[48:09] familiar your family
[48:22] daughters
[48:27] is groaning this is
[48:33] children of God
[48:36] Amen
[48:38] and that's why the bridegroom
[49:20] Lord Jesus Christ needs to be
[49:24] healed
[50:04] located
[50:51] if for God wanted
[50:55] was to correct his bride
[50:59] I'm not saying it doesn't go with this
[51:03] but let me I want you to understand that
[51:05] first it's a refuge
[51:07] this message is a refuge
[51:11] many of us take it as a rock
[51:16] if you're not in the message
[51:24] I haven't understood what this message
[51:43] and the message
[51:48] he's speaking of a series of Refuge
[51:50] foreign
[51:56] [Applause]
[53:12] wow his enemy had the privilege and
[53:14] right to drag him from that Altar and
[53:17] kill him
[53:18] next paragraph says
[53:21] foreign
[53:29] [Music]
[54:32] water Brooks
[54:35] she doesn't want to do it
[54:39] that's why I believe this message
[54:45] shouldn't be taken as some for something
[54:48] to correct
[54:50] there's a balance in all this I don't
[54:52] want you to be unbalanced
[54:54] but I believe that first
[55:00] as a refreshing yeah
[55:05] she doesn't want to do it
[55:08] something in here
[55:11] I don't want to do this
[55:22] is what God's word says
[55:35] she's in love with him
[55:39] [Applause]
[56:14] [Applause]
[56:25] amen right
[56:27] oh brethren
[56:31] is this message is
[56:35] a refuge
[56:42] I don't believe the bride needs so much
[56:47] I believe she needs a refuge
[56:50] because she corrects herself
[56:54] she should stop doing it
[56:58] says
[57:06] you can do it by her own strengths
[57:11] God provides a place
[57:19] a message of Grace
[57:22] that makes the difference
[57:24] from all the restaurants
[57:30] those places are a refuge
[57:34] but let me tell you this
[57:37] here is where it's heard
[57:40] a place of Refuge
[57:44] must have two things
[57:46] must have help
[57:49] for whoever is your protection from the
[57:54] enemy
[57:57] but must also be strong
[58:02] has to be strengthened
[58:05] for the Enemy No pueda so not be able to
[58:10] The Refuge
[58:13] take that person out
[58:18] of denominations
[58:22] they offer help
[58:26] they don't have enough strength
[58:29] Paramount
[58:33] Christian
[58:36] in the things of God
[58:39] that's why Spirits returns
[58:43] that's why they're spirits
[58:47] of religious what happens
[58:53] to those places
[59:07] so hold that person there
[59:11] but my God
[59:14] he's a refugee yes
[59:42] and David speaking to the Lord the
[59:48] day that the Lord had delivered him out
[59:50] of the hand of all his enemies
[1:00:25] My Savior thou saves me from violence
[1:00:29] because you can have a refuge yes
[1:00:32] and that's what that's all people have
[1:00:35] found
[1:00:36] only a refuge
[1:00:39] that's all they find in drugs just a
[1:00:43] refuge something temporary
[1:00:47] comes with his clothes
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:11] this place where the Waters of the Holy
[1:01:13] Ghost descended
[1:01:16] and he says but they would uh leave
[1:01:19] again
[1:01:22] they couldn't hold it
[1:01:25] now that's what happens with us the Holy
[1:01:29] Ghost comes in
[1:01:30] but just as it came in
[1:01:33] we have a baptism yes
[1:01:49] stay there
[1:01:54] your Refuge
[1:02:06] [Music]
[1:02:18] so hold it there
[1:02:23] you need a fortress in that reference
[1:02:29] a fortress forgive me a refuge without a
[1:02:33] fortress is of no benefit
[1:02:35] are you understanding
[1:02:41] is of no
[1:02:44] benefits
[1:02:46] use your enemy will come in
[1:02:49] the Fortress
[1:03:03] [Music]
[1:03:06] but if the Refuge is missing a fortress
[1:03:11] easily they'll take you out
[1:03:14] yes
[1:03:15] and that's what has happened
[1:03:18] they are a lot they are refuges
[1:03:22] but they don't have a fortress
[1:03:27] that is what has happened
[1:03:31] the Holy Spirit comes we open our heart
[1:03:33] to God
[1:03:35] we give a place in our hearts of the
[1:03:39] Lord
[1:03:39] but there's not a fortress
[1:03:56] and Life come out
[1:04:04] if the bride can stay long enough Under
[1:04:06] the Sun
[1:04:09] to germanize that seed of life but we
[1:04:13] are unable to foreign
[1:04:50] for When government promised to Abraham
[1:04:52] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:04:54] swore by himself
[1:04:59] sincerely blessing I Will Bless thee and
[1:05:02] multiplying I will multiply themes
[1:05:07] and so after he patiently endured he
[1:05:09] obtained the promise
[1:05:17] foreign by the greater and on oath for
[1:05:20] confirmation is to them
[1:05:22] and end of our Strife this is
[1:05:33] God willing more abundantly to show unto
[1:05:36] The Heirs of the Prime Minister
[1:05:40] amen
[1:05:42] immutable immutability of his Council
[1:05:46] confirmed it by an oath
[1:05:48] this is
[1:06:06] immutable things in which it was
[1:06:08] impossible for God to lie we might have
[1:06:10] a strong consolation who have fled for
[1:06:13] Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set
[1:06:15] before us
[1:06:23] which hope we have as an anchor of the
[1:06:26] Soul both sure and steadfast and which
[1:06:28] entries into that within the veil now
[1:06:33] one
[1:06:34] Lugar a place of
[1:06:38] refugees I believe is this message
[1:06:41] I believe this is
[1:06:44] the help God's children needed is
[1:06:49] the voice of Elijah for our time
[1:06:57] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:07:01] not only just to heal the world
[1:07:04] but it has enough power
[1:07:07] to Anchor the Believers
[1:07:10] anchor the Son of God
[1:07:13] and to protect
[1:07:15] from the enemy they lost the spirit
[1:07:20] from the Shadows
[1:07:25] because there's no benefits
[1:07:31] still attacking us
[1:07:34] but this message is
[1:07:37] a real Refuge
[1:07:39] look
[1:07:41] our problem is
[1:07:46] that many times we stay on the edge
[1:07:49] we stay at the Gate of The Refuge
[1:07:54] protection but for you to really be
[1:07:57] protected
[1:07:58] you must come in
[1:08:03] I'll just come in but come in although
[1:08:07] the deeper that you go in
[1:08:10] the more hidden that you are
[1:08:14] the more you go in
[1:08:16] the word and the message
[1:08:20] [Music]
[1:08:22] but we like to play we want the medicine
[1:08:28] you don't want to answer completely
[1:08:31] we want the medicine
[1:08:34] but then we want to go out out again SOS
[1:08:37] that is
[1:09:34] foreign foreign
[1:10:42] the first thing he had to come upon his
[1:10:45] own free will see brother
[1:10:51] it's not to force the people
[1:10:54] if the people
[1:10:56] okay foreign
[1:11:03] [Music]
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:53] No One's Gonna force you
[1:11:56] look brother
[1:11:58] what happens when we aren't forced
[1:12:02] sometimes there's not an urgency
[1:12:07] or when we feel a little bit of Refuge
[1:12:10] it's okay
[1:12:18] we begin to think about everything
[1:12:20] that's behind us
[1:12:23] and we stop going in elementary
[1:12:31] is a rapture
[1:12:36] he reads the scripture for that message
[1:12:40] and in Psalms 27. it was Psalm 27 says
[1:12:47] this is too important Brethren it's
[1:12:50] important this is important for the
[1:12:53] bride
[1:12:55] might be not important for someone else
[1:12:58] but it's important
[1:13:00] the Lord is my light and my salvation
[1:13:03] Whom Shall I
[1:13:04] Fearless
[1:13:08] the Lord is the strength of my life of
[1:13:10] whom shall I be afraid
[1:13:20] even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me
[1:13:23] to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[1:13:25] fell down
[1:13:34] though a host shouldn't Camp against me
[1:13:36] my heart shall not fear the world shall
[1:13:38] rise against me and this will I be
[1:13:40] confident
[1:14:05] it's all in the house of the Lord all
[1:14:07] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[1:14:09] of the Lord and to inquire in this
[1:14:11] Temple Brothers
[1:15:01] are his wonders
[1:15:05] we are satisfied
[1:15:09] with plain church
[1:15:13] but God says that's not what I want with
[1:15:16] us
[1:15:29] truly know who I am um
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:43] You Don't See either way out yeah that's
[1:16:46] that that's bulldoze yourself

[1:17:54] like
[1:17:56] this is a completely
[1:17:59] where you're completely sold to him
[1:18:12] where plane was the medicine
[1:18:16] we're playing with it David
[1:18:19] is saying
[1:18:22] you will be my Refugee
[1:18:25] when I decide
[1:18:29] that this is my house to dwell forever
[1:19:06] decisions can come
[1:19:39] he says
[1:20:01] he says you need to be planted
[1:20:04] by the by the currents of water this is
[1:20:09] that gives its fruit at its time
[1:20:13] she says this is
[1:20:21] the fruit of the Lord
[1:20:45] everything she needs to produce
[1:20:48] [Music]
[1:20:50] I'm not sure if you're found amongst
[1:20:53] them
