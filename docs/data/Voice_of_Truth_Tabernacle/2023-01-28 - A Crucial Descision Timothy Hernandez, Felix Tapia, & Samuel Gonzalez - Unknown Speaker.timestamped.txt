[17:15] [Music]
[17:23] it's an honor and a privilege to be
[17:25] before you
[17:27] I want to thank my pastor
[17:30] for the trust that he's given each and
[17:32] every one of us
[17:36] um as a title
[17:40] um we've put
[17:42] a momentous decision
[17:54] a momentous decision
[17:57] but if I can give a little thoughts
[18:02] the right decision
[18:07] if I can give the definition of decision
[18:14] it's the ACT
[18:16] of or need for making up one's mind
[18:22] something you choose
[18:25] a choice
[18:29] if we can open our scriptures to Ruth
[18:31] chapter 1 verse 14.
[18:37] you know and it's just not any decision
[18:39] that we have to make
[18:42] it's the right decision we should make
[18:48] Ruth chapter 1 verse 14 says like this
[18:53] and they lifted up their voice and wept
[18:56] again
[18:58] mother-in-law by Ruth clave unto her yes
[19:07] and she said behold thy sister-in-law
[19:10] has gone back unto her people
[19:17] and unto her Gods return Thou after thy
[19:20] sister-in-law
[19:22] Andrew said and treat me not to leave
[19:25] thee or to return from falling after
[19:28] thee for whether thou goest I will go
[19:31] and where thou largest I will launch thy
[19:35] people shall be my people and thy God my
[19:38] God
[19:42] is
[19:52] listen closely without dyest I will die
[19:56] and there will I be buried the Lord do
[19:59] so to me and more also if odd but death
[20:01] part thee and me
[20:04] um
[20:18] Heavenly Father Lord we give you thanks
[20:21] gracias Lord for giving us a privilege
[20:24] to be here once again
[20:26] Lord to be able to exalt Your Name
[20:29] Lord to glorify and Worship You Lord
[20:33] without you or nothing
[20:36] Lord I put myself aside and maybe you
[20:39] speaking through through me Lord
[20:42] and Lord if I make a mistake
[20:48] you help me Lord you stand me are you
[20:51] there we put all this in your hands we
[20:52] put the service in your hands
[20:55] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:58] amen you may be seated
[21:01] you know
[21:04] in our daily lives
[21:06] we all always make decisions
[21:09] it should be moment every every day
[21:12] there's always a decision that has to be
[21:15] taken you know this is to even wake up
[21:18] it's a decision to get out of bed as a
[21:20] decision
[21:23] you know and and
[21:25] but I think it's necessary you know that
[21:29] we do the right decision
[21:31] correct the right decision with God
[21:37] and and this the scripture that I read
[21:40] you know it I believe it typifies
[21:44] the time and day we are today
[21:47] in that time there was uh scarce of food
[21:50] and this is
[21:55] you know we don't even see that many
[21:58] eggs anymore in the stores no no we must
[22:00] no November where was you know but I
[22:03] believe there's also a spiritual
[22:05] scarceness
[22:08] you know that that people need more
[22:12] you know there was Hunger in that time
[22:15] [Music]
[22:16] you know but hear the scripture
[22:19] shows us of a decision that someone made
[22:24] you know Ruth root
[22:28] that she made the decision to go with
[22:30] Naomi
[22:32] you know in this land
[22:36] uh in the land of the moabites
[22:40] um there was there was a
[22:43] a father named abimelech
[22:47] Naomi you know what me you know and they
[22:50] had children
[22:52] melon and Chilean Maloney
[22:56] and they married unto orpha and Ruth
[23:02] you know but the time came
[23:04] uh when Naomi became a widow
[23:08] the time came when orpha became a widow
[23:13] and then Ruth did as well
[23:16] and so we see now that they did not have
[23:22] a head okay
[23:24] you know because the Bible says
[23:28] is the head of the man
[23:31] and the man is the head of the wife yeah
[23:34] you know but now we're seeing that that
[23:37] now they're widows so they have no one
[23:39] to lean on to uh
[23:44] so now the conditions are a little bit
[23:47] different conditions you know it's three
[23:50] widows living together now
[23:53] and Naomi heard the news
[23:56] like I said they were scarce of food
[23:59] yeah
[24:01] but she heard that there was food in her
[24:03] Homeland is
[24:09] you know there was something better than
[24:11] where she was at at that moment yeah
[24:17] Ruth was um
[24:20] she was a moabite a gentile
[24:24] she was a
[24:27] Pagano and Naomi said it's necessary for
[24:31] me to go home you know
[24:34] you know but what about Ruth
[24:38] you know
[24:40] Ruth didn't have anyone
[24:44] where she was going to go
[24:47] you know the decision that she was going
[24:49] to take
[24:51] so she had to leave everything behind
[24:55] she actually family friends
[24:58] everything that she has you know and now
[25:02] so that that time came
[25:05] what she had to do a momentous decision
[25:10] in other words a crucial decision
[25:15] that could Define her future definition
[25:21] hallelujah amen
[25:24] we see that Naomi is
[25:27] her her name means placenta
[25:35] um
[25:37] uh and she changed her name Tamara
[25:41] which means bitterness
[25:43] you know everywhere that that
[25:46] Naomi looked
[25:49] you know she saw that she was surrounded
[25:52] by bitterness
[25:55] Ruth was a widow
[25:58] orpha was a winner
[26:00] and she was also widowed
[26:05] you know that that kind of takes me to
[26:08] one conclusion
[26:10] that the things where that the the
[26:12] things that we're surrounded by the
[26:14] people
[26:17] our atmosphere that we're buying
[26:20] you know can take us to do the wrong
[26:22] decisions
[26:24] you know so so what are you doing
[26:28] to not make those wrong decisions
[26:34] while an individual
[26:37] you know it doesn't have to make a
[26:39] decision
[26:41] you know there's there's there's peace I
[26:44] I pass you know there's there's uh
[26:46] Tranquility
[26:47] you know but when someone is has to make
[26:52] a decision
[26:54] you know that's when schools can get a
[26:57] little bit
[26:58] you know a little bit weird you know
[27:00] because
[27:01] now it's up to you to make that decision
[27:06] you know but what are you going to do
[27:08] when the times get rough it'll give us
[27:11] when it's good it gets hard when
[27:13] everything seems like it's going
[27:14] downhill
[27:17] you know in that time God is waiting for
[27:20] a response from you
[27:24] now are you going to wait upon him
[27:28] are you going to make the right
[27:29] decisions
[27:31] you know
[27:33] Hallelujah when the time comes for
[27:35] decisions
[27:39] you know we have to make sure we're
[27:40] anchored to God
[27:43] you know because it's
[27:48] a decision
[27:50] you know
[27:52] to follow God
[27:54] you know if if you don't want to that's
[27:57] up to you
[27:59] if you don't want to leave everything
[28:03] you know but but I believe you will you
[28:06] will suffer the song consequences
[28:09] you know but make sure you grab a hold
[28:12] of his promises
[28:14] you know he said that he would take you
[28:16] out
[28:17] you know that he would deliver you you
[28:21] know he would he said he promised that
[28:22] he would be there with you
[28:24] and also just believe
[28:27] trust in him
[28:35] nowadays
[28:37] or India
[28:40] we're faced with a lot of decisions
[28:45] a lot of a lot of decisions muchas
[28:48] decisions
[28:49] and and so Naomi said
[28:52] I'm gonna return home
[28:56] and they they all answer they said well
[28:59] we're not going to leave
[29:03] and Naomi kept insisting
[29:06] she said I'm going to leave
[29:11] and orpha
[29:13] kissed her and said goodbye
[29:21] she said in other words I don't want to
[29:23] make the right decision
[29:26] correct I don't want God to bless me you
[29:28] know
[29:29] I don't want to leave my Idols
[29:32] I don't want to leave what's mine you
[29:36] know but a child of God you know he's
[29:38] going to give up his rights
[29:40] he's going to give up everything that he
[29:42] owns
[29:43] you know it's a follow what God wants
[29:46] for him
[29:49] but here's Ruth
[29:53] he says no way I'm leaving you yeah
[29:56] where you go I'll go
[29:59] where you go
[30:01] I'll go yeah
[30:13] I think we can see here
[30:17] that that Ruth made the right decision
[30:21] correct the room made the decision
[30:28] that impacted her yeah
[30:31] her future
[30:33] now I I started to think
[30:35] what if Rue didn't make that decision
[30:41] where would that decision have taken her
[30:53] yeah
[30:54] Lori
[30:55] the definition of the word momentous
[30:59] it's of great significance or of great
[31:02] importance
[31:07] especially in its bearing on the future
[31:14] especially in the burying of the future
[31:18] you know it only takes one decision
[31:22] it only takes up one decision
[31:25] to follow God
[31:27] and leave everything
[31:30] or make the wrong decision
[31:33] and not end up where we should have been
[31:37] is
[31:41] Hallelujah many times we don't make the
[31:44] right decisions
[31:46] it's because we're not still working
[31:50] you know we're not calmos
[31:54] you know we don't wait on the Lord
[32:00] and and that's what takes us to do
[32:03] the decision that sometimes we regrets
[32:08] I want to read this quote from Brother
[32:10] Branham
[32:12] and the message Redeemer Redemption
[32:17] notice Ruth was willing to forsake her
[32:20] Idols
[32:24] forsake her past life
[32:27] forsaker people
[32:29] forsake everything and return with Naomi
[32:33] no matter what the circumstances
[32:36] she was willing to go on
[32:40] that's the way every man that comes to
[32:43] Christ must be first be willing
[32:46] [Applause]
[32:50] regardless
[32:52] regardless of the circumstances
[32:56] regardless of what life throws at us
[33:00] regardless of what what what Satan
[33:03] throws at us
[33:06] you know we should still decide and make
[33:09] the right decisions
[33:11] the decision that Ruth made
[33:14] led her to the right path
[33:17] correct you know it was not an easy
[33:20] decision
[33:21] she was human like you and me
[33:23] you know maybe she could have doubted
[33:27] you know but but she made the right
[33:30] decisions
[33:33] that God has something for him
[33:40] and I believe Ruth
[33:44] she was not forgotten but she was
[33:47] remembered
[33:48] you know who here wants to be remembered
[33:52] we're up there in heaven
[33:55] you know to remember that we did
[33:58] everything that we could
[34:01] you know for God
[34:07] my my dad was told me
[34:13] from Brother Branham I believe
[34:17] where he said that this man was uh in
[34:20] heaven is
[34:22] you know and he was standing before God
[34:26] the white Throne
[34:27] Blanco you know
[34:30] and and he said the whole
[34:33] sorry excuse me before the gates
[34:36] and his name and he said hold my name is
[34:39] you know Timothy Hernandez
[34:43] and so the angel kept looking and
[34:45] looking yeah
[34:47] and he says you know your name is not
[34:50] here
[34:52] and so
[34:54] he said no but look again it should be
[34:57] in there
[34:59] no I'm looking I'm looking it's not
[35:01] there it's not there
[35:03] but if you would like to present your
[35:05] case
[35:07] you know before God you know go in there
[35:13] so there was that man that stood before
[35:17] God and this is
[35:20] and he asked him
[35:22] you know you know what did you do okay
[35:25] well you know I brought lives to Christ
[35:28] I did this
[35:31] and then he says but have you ever
[35:33] stolen
[35:37] have you ever lied
[35:39] yes yes
[35:41] see have you ever done something you
[35:46] shouldn't have done yes
[35:51] you know but so then
[35:54] he saw that you know where he was
[35:57] heading to
[35:59] Eva but then he felt a touch on his
[36:01] shoulders
[36:03] you know Jesus Christ you know saying
[36:07] but he stood up for me
[36:10] he stood up for me you know he stood up
[36:14] for for me for me like in Earth
[36:37] you know
[36:41] when a person is LED and guided by God
[36:43] Persona is and keeps us calm yes
[36:48] you know
[36:52] you know God guides them
[36:54] you know because it's the word of God
[36:56] that said that says
[36:59] blessed are those who wait
[37:02] on the Lord your brothers and sisters
[37:06] let's make that right decision
[37:09] let's make that right decision
[37:11] to leave everything that we that we have
[37:14] you know and if you can't leave
[37:16] everything
[37:17] start with one thing
[37:24] amen
[37:33] [Applause]
[37:35] for God
[37:40] but I came to have church
[37:45] tonight's decision I don't know if I
[37:47] pronounced that right
[37:52] uh
[37:53] but
[37:54] I would like to thank God
[37:58] for putting the trust in me
[38:02] I would like to thank brother Timmy and
[38:04] Samuel
[38:07] Samuel to be able to share this Pulpit
[38:10] tonight with them
[38:12] you know we're Gathering last yesterday
[38:15] the other day with Isaac with uh Samuel
[38:18] estamos
[38:21] and we're ashamed what we're going to
[38:23] talk about is
[38:26] and we started talking about a crucial
[38:28] decision
[38:31] you know every day we make decisions
[38:36] you know and what we're going to wear
[38:39] you know we don't know if there's going
[38:41] to be a thunderstorm coming up
[38:48] living here in Colorado
[38:50] 20 means 100.
[39:26] you know the crucial decision on what
[39:29] we're gonna do that day
[39:32] every day in our lives
[39:36] we make a crucial decision
[39:41] whether we're going to get up and go to
[39:43] work
[39:45] or we're going to stay home and stay
[39:48] sleep and get fired
[39:52] you know but if you can turn your your
[39:55] your uh your scriptures
[39:59] to root chapter 2 verse 10 and 11.
[40:06] then she fell on her face and bowed
[40:09] herself
[40:11] bowed herself to the ground and said
[40:13] unto him why have have I found Grace and
[40:17] die eyes and thou showed us
[40:20] that shouldn't take knowledge of me
[40:24] seeing that I am a sin I am a stranger
[40:27] rude
[40:40] foreign
[40:58] father and thy mother and their mother
[41:01] and the land that they uh David and art
[41:06] come into the people that
[41:08] that which though knowest therefore not
[41:12] boss
[41:17] ladyjo is
[41:39] when Naomi
[41:41] lost her two sons and her husband
[41:46] she talked to her two daughter-in-laws
[41:53] and she said and she said I am gonna go
[41:56] back to my land
[42:00] and those two daughter-in-laws were root
[42:02] and Opera
[42:04] I I don't know
[42:10] and they shall return back to their
[42:13] family yes
[42:16] so they can take care of you
[42:20] and also made the decision to leave
[42:25] she went back to worship her Idols
[42:30] to her God Jesus
[42:36] that she wanted to go back with Naomi
[42:42] Ruth told Naomi
[42:46] let your people be my people
[42:50] let me live where you live
[42:54] let me die where you die
[42:59] bury me where you are buried
[43:04] but the biggest one for me is
[43:08] she said let your God be my God
[43:14] you know at that point man and that's
[43:17] the moment that was a crucial decision
[43:20] you know to live where she was
[43:22] comfortable
[43:25] you know sometimes it's hard to live
[43:27] where we're comfortable
[43:30] every morning when it's cold
[43:33] you know we it's hard for us to get out
[43:36] of our bed is
[43:41] you know I can imagine
[43:44] that she was going to leave everything
[43:46] behind
[43:49] everything that she probably knew
[43:52] she was leaving it behind
[43:55] all those Idols all those Gods
[44:00] she was leaving all that behind
[44:06] man what did these fishing Ruth bad made
[44:11] to go to a different place
[44:17] see and she went and she worked on the
[44:19] fields
[44:22] you know to help her mother-in-law
[44:25] and you know and that's when Boaz saw
[44:28] her yeah
[44:30] and he saw Grace on Earth
[44:34] and she asked why did you see grace on
[44:37] me
[44:40] and he said because I see what you have
[44:43] done for thy mother-in-laws
[44:47] you know brother Brandon says that's
[44:49] where she received her Redemption
[44:54] see brother Branham says
[44:57] that Boaz represents Christ
[45:01] and root represents the church
[45:06] Boaz was Ruth's Redemption
[45:11] the root so how do we receive our
[45:14] Redemption
[45:17] that was when Christ died for us
[45:21] you know there is no other way that we
[45:23] could receive this
[45:26] you know it was so hard imagine
[45:31] why it's so painful to go through what
[45:34] Christ did
[45:36] but he says that will be done
[45:41] you know he says that will be done
[45:45] you know he loves us so much
[45:48] you know he didn't say he couldn't
[45:50] destroy the world at that moment
[45:53] but he said that will be done
[45:57] and it's surrendered everything
[46:00] and he surrendered everything
[46:03] so we can receive so we can be safe from
[46:06] our sins
[46:09] so we can be saved from our sicknesses
[46:14] see there is no sickness that can stand
[46:16] in your Nosotros
[46:49] halleluia
[46:52] see sometimes it's hard for us to make
[46:54] decisions
[46:57] especially when when when when it's a
[47:00] critical situation
[47:05] you know we we it's it's hard it's
[47:08] official you know when when you want to
[47:10] leave to to a different place
[47:14] you know you say I don't want to do this
[47:17] it's comfortable where I'm at it's
[47:19] comfortable but I believe sometimes we
[47:22] just need to get out of our comfort zone
[47:27] you know and just move around a little
[47:30] bit
[47:31] you know and and let God begin to do his
[47:34] work on us
[47:37] you're not gonna go fully
[47:41] um how do I say this
[47:45] see when when you decide to to follow
[47:48] God
[47:51] you know it's not it's not an easy way
[47:54] to
[47:55] it's when you do it
[47:58] you do it one step at a time
[48:02] I know I know it's hard to surrender
[48:05] everything at once
[48:09] you know to be honest I'm still
[48:12] struggling with some things
[48:16] I am not a perfect
[48:19] Christiano Perfecto you know I'm still
[48:21] making decisions to let go of things
[48:26] and sometimes it's hard
[48:28] you know because that's what the flesh
[48:31] learns
[48:32] because the flesh is from this Earth
[48:36] and I love the things
[48:39] you know it's not easy no it's faster
[48:42] that's right brother you know we have to
[48:45] leave all those Idols behind
[48:49] you know we have to just start letting
[48:51] them go one by one
[48:54] see when Ruth made the decision
[48:58] to leave her land to go in Naomi
[49:03] that was one decision
[49:06] you know and every time she made a
[49:09] decision
[49:12] if you made a decision a few Services
[49:15] back
[49:17] to leave something behind
[49:20] come to the Altar for the first time
[49:24] you know today you can make another
[49:27] decision oh you step
[49:50] you know when I made the decision to
[49:52] follow Christ
[49:56] there a lot of people probably laughed
[49:59] at me
[50:00] they said oh you're you're a Christian
[50:03] now
[50:06] they told me oh you're a Christian now
[50:11] you know oh you're a pastor
[50:13] oh here comes the Hallelujah
[50:16] you know but I didn't care what they
[50:18] said
[50:20] I made the decision
[50:22] and it was from my own for my own Goods
[50:26] it wasn't for the good
[51:24] you know you make a decision to wake me
[51:27] up every day
[52:00] I've been out there
[52:49] it's coming foreign
[53:02] foreign
[53:58] I want to read this quote
[54:03] and I'm going to be finishing with this
[54:05] yesterday

[54:10] young beautiful life a life never like
[54:13] that was never to be will be go ahead

[54:32] a life like the lamb had but now the
[54:36] father said are you willing
[54:42] is your love for your brother and great
[54:45] enough is
[54:51] your love for that sinful stinking world
[54:54] that you were born in
[54:56] is
[55:00] do you love them enough to forfeit your
[55:04] life
[55:08] do you love them enough to take their
[55:10] place
[55:14] to Bear their sins
[55:17] the hardest critical death
[55:21] you're there it could be nothing
[55:25] to die to die that kind of death but him
[55:32] and in their confidence such a decision
[55:35] was made
[55:36] circumference
[55:39] until the blood dripped from his from
[55:42] his brows
[55:45] he was under a string of of the sins of
[55:49] the world was upon him yes
[55:55] and he looked into the face of the dove
[55:58] and said not my will be but thy will be
[56:01] done
[56:09] oh can we have that decision in our
[56:11] hearts
[56:14] can we have that decision in our hearts
[56:17] tonight
[56:19] just one step at a time
[56:22] um it could be a domino effect
[56:27] you know one thing after another
[56:30] you know you could leave one thing after
[56:33] another
[56:35] and maybe if you have never made that
[56:37] decision
[56:39] maybe you haven't made a decision if you
[56:42] want to follow God or not
[56:45] you haven't decided if you wanna if you
[56:47] want to live for the world
[56:53] tonight could be your night
[56:56] leave everything behind
[56:58] trust me I know it's not easy
[57:02] just leave everything behind
[57:04] one step at a time
[57:06] are you gonna make that crucial decision
[57:09] foreign
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:27] [Applause]
[58:11] even through the midst of our of our our
[58:14] flaws
[58:17] amen right away if you please open your
[58:19] Bibles to Ruth chapter 1 verses 16.
[58:27] when you have him please say Amen
[58:31] Ruth chapter 1 verse 16 to 17.
[58:42] laughs
[58:46] and it says like this these say I see
[58:48] and Ruth said
[58:50] respond and treat me not to leave thee
[58:53] or to return from following after thee
[58:56] now
[58:59] for whether thou go is
[59:09] thy people shall be my people
[59:12] and thy God my God
[59:16] verse 17 where thou diaist will I die
[59:22] and there will I be buried
[59:26] the Lord do so to me and more also if
[59:29] ought but death part thee and me
[59:39] God are the blessings
[59:43] The Book of Ruth Brothers
[59:45] it's not just the book of History
[59:50] not only is it a story of love no
[59:52] solamentes but I believe that this book
[59:56] of Ruth is
[59:58] a book of Revelation too
[1:00:02] you see it might be a short book of just
[1:00:05] four chapters
[1:00:08] you see but there is a lot that we can
[1:00:10] capture from this book you know
[1:00:15] Ruth is one of the two books that has
[1:00:18] the name of a woman
[1:00:24] is there any brother or sister out there
[1:00:27] that can tell me the other name of the
[1:00:29] book
[1:00:32] there's Ruth and what else
[1:00:37] it's there that's right Brothers sorry
[1:00:40] Brothers I just want to make sure all of
[1:00:41] you are awake tonight
[1:00:45] in this book
[1:00:47] we can find the pilgrimage
[1:00:55] these women
[1:00:57] that we see in this book
[1:01:00] we see them walking in this path Las
[1:01:03] miramos
[1:01:04] where these women had walked through
[1:01:08] you see but there also had to be a
[1:01:10] rejection
[1:01:13] through a woman
[1:01:16] through a church
[1:01:19] because these women
[1:01:22] represented a church
[1:01:24] you see Naomi Ruth de Norfolk
[1:01:29] they represented a church
[1:01:32] you see Ruth
[1:01:35] represented the Church of the Bride
[1:01:37] representative
[1:01:42] represented the Orthodox Church
[1:01:46] which brother Branham says and mentions
[1:01:48] too
[1:01:50] but in this book
[1:01:53] we also see the rejection of a woman
[1:01:55] named orphan miramos
[1:01:59] you see brother Branham says
[1:02:02] the orpha represented the lukewarm
[1:02:05] Church
[1:02:09] the cultures like Alessia
[1:02:36] etc
[1:02:37] etc this lukewarm church is
[1:02:40] appears in the Bible too
[1:02:43] we could see in Revelations chapter 3
[1:02:46] verse 15 to 16.
[1:02:49] you could see for yourself Brothers
[1:02:53] in the beginning of the book of Ruth
[1:02:57] I believe that we can already start to
[1:02:59] see death
[1:03:02] you see we see Naomi with their family
[1:03:04] and and Bethlehem
[1:03:07] familia in Belen but in the time that
[1:03:10] they are there
[1:03:12] you know there was a shortage
[1:03:17] of bread and wheat the comida Is So
[1:03:21] eventually they leave
[1:03:23] they leave from Bethlehem
[1:03:27] to go to the land of Moab
[1:03:31] you see and there's something that we
[1:03:33] must capture from here Brothers
[1:03:36] you see there is always a
[1:03:40] dangerous when one leaves its land
[1:03:44] there is always a danger
[1:03:47] there's always going to be problems
[1:03:52] when one leaves its land
[1:03:55] and here we can see that when Naomi and
[1:03:58] her family leave yeah
[1:04:02] from Bethlehem to Moab cuando salad
[1:04:06] they start to have problems
[1:04:09] listen but through the midst of all
[1:04:11] these problems
[1:04:15] go through
[1:04:17] it was all a plan of God
[1:04:20] you see Brothers Hermanos the prophet
[1:04:23] brother Branham said
[1:04:26] once we leave from the will of God
[1:04:30] we will see how horrible we will have to
[1:04:32] pay we will see how horrible we will
[1:04:35] have to pay
[1:04:37] you see Brothers once we leave from the
[1:04:40] will of God
[1:04:46] once we leave God's will
[1:04:49] don't think that everything will go well
[1:04:51] right
[1:04:53] because eventually the problems will
[1:04:55] come
[1:04:57] failures will come
[1:04:59] the tribulations
[1:05:06] left the land of bethlehemian
[1:05:10] they begin to have problems
[1:05:13] they begin to have failures
[1:05:23] one of the first things that happened
[1:05:27] I think I already I think everyone
[1:05:29] already knows
[1:05:30] Naomi's husband dies
[1:05:34] the second thing that happens is
[1:05:37] that the both sons of Naomi dies
[1:05:43] and here we can see Naomi yeah
[1:05:47] in a situation
[1:05:49] well she is helpless
[1:05:56] without a husband
[1:05:59] and without her sons and Naomi is left
[1:06:03] with her two daughter-in-laws
[1:06:08] gracias
[1:06:11] but the daughters
[1:06:14] are also left without husbands
[1:06:18] esposos so it seems like Naomi is
[1:06:23] left without hope is
[1:06:26] she decides to tell the
[1:06:28] daughters-in-laws
[1:06:31] to go back to their parents homes
[1:06:35] you see they tell it says here in Ruth
[1:06:38] chapter one verse 8.
[1:06:42] and Naomi said unto her two
[1:06:46] daughters-in-laws
[1:06:48] go return each to her mother's house the
[1:06:52] Lord deal kindly with you as ye have
[1:06:54] dealt with the dead and with me this is
[1:07:12] trying to send her daughters-in-law back
[1:07:18] you see Brothers Naomi no I mean was so
[1:07:22] bitter is
[1:07:24] because of what she has been through
[1:07:26] youth
[1:08:06] Holiness when we are outside of the will
[1:08:08] of God
[1:08:10] when we think that our life
[1:08:14] we can do it on our own and not by the
[1:08:18] will of God
[1:08:19] you see that then there is no Revival it
[1:08:22] says there is no true Revival
[1:08:26] there's no Revival
[1:08:29] there is no true happiness
[1:08:31] and that's why the holy spirit is not
[1:08:34] there
[1:08:35] you see Naomi I believe in her Hearts
[1:08:39] she wanted a Revival
[1:08:42] I believe that she was looking for a
[1:08:45] great room
[1:08:46] I believe that she was looking for
[1:08:48] something spiritual Brothers
[1:08:55] Naomi found herself
[1:08:59] and the denomination with their family
[1:09:04] Naomi found herself
[1:09:06] control surrounded
[1:09:11] all these religious people
[1:09:17] Naomi and her family were there
[1:09:21] was no joy
[1:09:24] and there was no Revival in the family
[1:09:29] you see when Naomi told her
[1:09:31] daughters-in-law to go cuando no I mean
[1:09:37] she could have stayed with Naomi
[1:09:42] but there was something that was pulling
[1:09:44] her
[1:09:46] from doing that
[1:09:49] you see orpha saw the world
[1:09:53] orfa observe the land of
[1:09:56] moabster
[1:09:58] they all looked good in Los Angeles
[1:10:04] the Gods in vain
[1:10:07] the fame the farmer
[1:10:35] [Applause]
[1:11:08] meanwhile we find ourselves
[1:11:24] there will be no true revive
[1:11:29] and if there is no true Revival
[1:11:32] there is no true joy in us
[1:11:36] just look at all these religious
[1:11:39] churches
[1:11:41] just look at all these denominational
[1:11:43] churches today
[1:11:45] all these churches can hold up to a
[1:11:47] thousand people denominations
[1:12:09] there
[1:12:17] was four stages
[1:12:23] in the Journey of Ruth
[1:12:26] meanwhile she went back to Berlin
[1:12:30] you see when Naomi returns
[1:12:33] I like that she returns being the type
[1:12:36] of the Jewish church
[1:12:41] but she doesn't go alone
[1:12:44] Ruth goes with her
[1:12:46] and when they arrived to belem
[1:12:51] don't think that the people welcome them
[1:12:54] with open arms
[1:13:00] is that Ruth found herself
[1:13:06] foreign
[1:14:07] that is when the problems will come yes
[1:14:13] it is when the devil will come with this
[1:14:16] doors
[1:14:18] and many other times that is one of the
[1:14:21] biggest problems
[1:14:25] you see sometimes not only our friends
[1:14:27] are going to criticize
[1:14:30] but our family is all criticize
[1:14:35] when Ruth arrives
[1:14:43] this is what we must understand
[1:14:46] sometimes we think that in the house of
[1:14:50] God
[1:14:51] only Believers of the message go there
[1:14:58] foreign
[1:15:52] to this world
[1:15:54] because this world doesn't have
[1:15:56] happiness
[1:15:58] this world is filled with drugs
[1:16:01] this one is filled with games
[1:16:04] prostitutes and everything
[1:16:08] oh Brothers Hermanos but when we're here
[1:16:12] that is where true happiness
[1:16:16] you see Brothers Brothers
[1:16:20] said in the message leaving it on
[1:16:22] element
[1:16:24] brother Brandon said this is it is true
[1:16:28] Brothers
[1:16:29] if Satan doesn't pursue Diablo
[1:16:34] if Satan isn't pursuing you
[1:16:38] that is because he already has yourself
[1:16:57] because we are fighting
[1:17:08] had to make a decision
[1:17:11] and there we can see justification
[1:17:16] the second one is that Ruth had to go
[1:17:18] work in the fields
[1:17:23] which was sanctification
[1:17:26] the third stage
[1:17:29] was that Ruth had to rest
[1:17:32] in other words
[1:17:34] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:40] we can it doesn't finish there you know
[1:17:43] what I mean it doesn't finish in those
[1:17:45] three stages
[1:17:48] don't just stay in the baptism of the
[1:17:51] Holy Spirit
[1:17:53] don't confirm yourself to just the
[1:17:55] baptism
[1:17:57] because we can lose ourselves
[1:18:01] but we need to keep going
[1:18:05] you see in the fourth stage
[1:18:08] we can see the marriage of Ruth and Boaz
[1:18:12] is
[1:18:15] you see when Boaz first saw Ruth
[1:18:20] the prophet says that it was love at
[1:18:24] first sight
[1:18:26] he did it Boaz didn't care
[1:18:30] what shirt
[1:18:33] well where she came from
[1:18:36] he always didn't care whether she had
[1:18:38] the Holy Spirit
[1:18:49] but she was gonna have a great journey
[1:18:53] a journey of justification
[1:18:56] sanctification baptism of the Holy
[1:19:00] Spirit
[1:19:04] eventually it was going to be an
[1:19:07] adoption
[1:19:10] because then the marriage comes foreign
[1:20:21] they were oh
[1:20:27] Brothers gracias brothers and in the
[1:20:32] same way
[1:20:40] he did it criticize us
[1:20:42] he didn't see our flies
[1:20:45] he didn't see what our weaknesses
[1:20:55] foreign
[1:21:41] [Music]
[1:21:49] preached in 1955
[1:21:53] that's where every man has to come to
[1:21:55] his life
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:21:59] is
[1:22:02] sometime is make a decision
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:07] you have to make a choice
[1:22:11] you have to make a choice whether you
[1:22:14] was going to have an education or not
[1:22:20] you had to make a choice who was going
[1:22:23] to be your wife
[1:22:28] there has to be a decisions and choices
[1:22:34] made in life and
[1:22:37] in this and this is
[1:22:40] this may be the night
[1:22:43] that you have your final call
[1:22:48] you make your choice
[1:22:51] whom you're going to serve
[1:22:55] oh brothers who are we going to serve
[1:22:58] we can't served two masters
[1:23:05] big one tonight
[1:23:06] [Music]
[1:23:09] we can't have one foot in the world and
[1:23:12] one foreign
[1:24:07] accept this message
[1:24:10] that God has given us through our
[1:24:12] prophets
[1:24:14] don't think that everything will go
[1:24:16] smooth Brothers
[1:24:26] the devil will throw his darts
[1:24:28] you see we will be criticized too
[1:24:32] not on the outside but in the church
[1:24:34] sometimes
[1:24:36] but no matter the circumstances
[1:24:40] whether we are being criticized
[1:24:44] we're going through hard times
[1:24:48] stay with the word of God
[1:24:51] you're always the message
[1:24:59] God is here tonight
[1:25:02] you see we are in the house of God
[1:25:06] the altar is open
[1:25:08] we are in the land
[1:25:13] oh Brothers how many what a Revival
[1:25:16] tonight
[1:25:25] there is no true happiness
[1:25:29] I don't want to be there no more
[1:25:37] he's waiting for you to make your
[1:25:40] decision
[1:25:42] oh Brothers Hermanos I don't know what
[1:25:45] you may be going tonight
[1:25:47] maybe tonight you might be going through
[1:25:49] some problems
[1:25:52] maybe you'll be going through some
[1:25:54] things
[1:25:58] he is here tonight
[1:26:05] it just requires of a decision
[1:26:09] it requires the attitude
[1:26:13] do we truly want the Revival tonight
[1:26:36] he is here to
[1:26:45] open your heart
