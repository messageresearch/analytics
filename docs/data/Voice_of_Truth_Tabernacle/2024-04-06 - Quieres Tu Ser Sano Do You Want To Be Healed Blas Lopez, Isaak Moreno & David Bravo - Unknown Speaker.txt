Jesus Christ love sweeter than that of our lordes by his love that we're here to worship His holy name we're going to be reading the word brothers because time goes by very quickly before that I'd like to thank our pastor brother Tito those watching to the internet may God bless them wherever they find themselves and may God give them the desire of their heart we're going to be reading the word in the Book of John chapter 5 when you have it you can say Amen Brothers the word of the Lord says like this after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda having five porches in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind of Hall withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubl the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 30 and8 years when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wil thou be made whole the impotent man answered him sir I have no man when the TR water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another steth down before me Jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk the the theme of today would you like to be healed how many would like to be healed Brothers we're going to be praying now gracious good Heavenly Father We Believe Lord that we're here before your presence I believe Lord that you're here father and I ask you help me and my interpreter you help the audience and if there's someone sick here the word is telling us if we would like to be healed and I believe that the angel of the Lord is here we give you thanks for everything Lord Lord and Savior Jesus Christ you may be seated Brothers as we're reading here of the paralytic that was in Bethesda and the House of Mercy Mercy Brothers how many believe they've come to the House of Mercy how many want to be healed Brothers Here Brothers we're going to leave healed if you come asking for something tonight going to obtain it tonight this paralyzed man that was here his healing Brothers he was Desiring for someone to place him into that pool blessed be the name of the and I believe that we're in it no one is pushing us into it we have the [Music] word In this passage Brothers there was five porches and the historians they go on to say they say that there was a porch there that was called the the Sheep porch porch of the sheep gate there that was the Sheep gate and we know brothers that the Lord Jesus Christ is the L of God and I believe with all of my heart that he went through those Gates because he was the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world don't you get excited about that Brothers Oh Brothers Here C there came an angel from time to time there many sick the word of God says God says there were many that were sick that were blind lame paralytics there were of All Sorts but they were just waiting for the troubling of the wat they couldn't see the angel they couldn't see the angel and I believe with all of my heart there are many people today that can't see the angel Brothers we have the angel of the church and many people can't see him we have an angel brothers who is a man he's a messenger brother who brings the word right so then Brothers they could only hear that when that angel would move the water we have the waters that is the word of God being tonight in the word there is heal there is Deliverance Brothers there is healing blessed be the Lord Brothers I don't know if you're happy many in that time they wanted to be healed but this man had been there 38 years laying down now I identify with this man I identify with was also laying down I was laying down and I didn't realize I was lost and I didn't realize I was sick and I didn't realize it Brothers do you believe it Brothers but brother Brothers there came that angel that angel brothers and he spoke to me of the word of the Eternal Word of God a Deliverance Brothers blessed be the Lord Something Beautiful to when you're able to say I've been delivered I no longer live but Christ liveth in me blessed be the Lord the most beautiful thing you can testify is that you no longer live Christ lives in you now Brothers the people want to see acts they want to see acts I am in a process as well believe every youth is also in a process I always say this that I was young Ono I have youth at my home now I have to live a life to my youth say oh my dad is living the life for me and I can't live a it's not by God God is my motor my God is my engine blessed be the Lord Prophet says in the message in the message let me look for it because I searched because I always take a picture I don't my I'm a little old school but glory to God I have to learn the prophet says Brothers in the message perseverance he says Jesus went by the pool he looked around Brothers filled with love filled with compassion we know what love means we see it from a human standpoint we see it from a human standpoint he says filled with compassion for sure you're speaking of human compassion true compassion is to do the will of who Brothers of God mine but God's see there it is uh in two paragraph 203 Jesus went through there he knew the will of God he had just finished resurrecting a dead man remember what happened here he went by that pool he went by this side there were mothers with children they waited for the angel of the Lord for him to trouble the waters and he came by there and went to a man that that had a sickness let's say a prostate issue he suffered with it for 38 years he was and that wasn't going to kill him do you want to be healed he said you want to be healed Brothers the angel of the Lord e e e believe of the the one that's all that's expected is just to believe on one occasion there was also a woman know the story she cried out brother she cried out one day I also C I shared with you a little bit of my testimony my son was burned a little and I would cry out in the hospit I would see him suffering for months but this woman only touched the edge of his garden and the prophet saids she came with something that many didn't have they didn't have brothers she was suffering for much time and I was like that for some time when I surrendered to the Lord it all changed now with god brother and that's why I'm here because I'm thankful that me being a sinner you know what the prophet says in the message everyone in the egg everyone is is similar they all look in the in the want get of one of those and here he got to this this I see myself in this picture I was in this picture Brothers begging Brothers like when the word says brothers that if we were to only believe of who this gift the greatest gift God could give man was his word bless be the Lord Brothers give the place to my brother now and God bless you God bless you Brothers how happy to be here amen you see talking about the lay man here I was seeing the difference between Spanish and English in verse six and in Spanish it says you want to be healed but in English it says wil thou be made whole you see brother brandham says we need to be made whole through the Mind spirit and body so Not only was this man going to be healed just from his condition but from his mind and his body and his soul amen amen we we all need that you see I was listening to something with um with my mom the other day and also our title is do you want to be healed and as a little subtitle I put take action or stay paralyzed but as I was was saying we were listening to a little motivation video and the guy says justice is when you get what you deserve Mercy is when when you don't get what what you deserve but Grace is when you get what you don't deserve amen see this man God Jesus had Grace for him you see I believe you know this guy as a young young man probably because this was an uncondition for 38 years so imagine you you know let's just say you've been struggling with the condition I don't know since you were 10 you know now I'm 20 that's already 10 years this man was struggling with the condition for 38 years I want to relate it to a person that maybe gets in a wreck get hurt they can't do what they like anymore you see at first you're all upset might be discouraged or you might be you know seeking God wanting your healing wanting recovery but then there comes a moment where this guy probably realized this is how I'm going to be forever now there's no hope for me you see I first he was probably claiming to God Lord Heal me take this away from me I don't want to be like this anymore how many have been like that I've been like that I don't want to be the same anymore you know on this man I believe after so much time ended up just being comfortable you see we get in a comfortable situation we get comfortable in our sin we get comfortable in our ways we say oh it's not that bad it's just a movie it's just a funny little joke but that joke keeps going and deeper the movie scenes get deeper you start hearing other things your mind starts opening up a little more to where now you want to experiment but we see that this man got comfortable that when Jesus came to him he just said they keep beating me to the pool now it doesn't say how far this pool was from him that I read anyways but this man had 38 years to get to that pool right you see a lot of the times we make excuses and we say oh it's because I'm not ready oh it's because you know I don't feel like it yet when I get older I'll just come to church I'll I'll just play the Bas I'll just song Lead I'll just preach but I'll give my life to God later because you see I could I could preach I could play the bass I could song Lead but that doesn't mean that I given my life to God you see many of you might be surprised and why why are you up there then many might be surprised and might say why are you up there then well one is because I'm being obedient to my pastor and second because I want to do better you see we should want to do better every day we should have a desire to keep pushing forward it shouldn't take years to get close to God you see but the good thing that I love about this story sorry my mouth's getting ey but the what I love about this story is that Jesus still came to this man you see even when we don't go to Jesus Jesus will still come to you and he will still give you the opportunity you see even when you're depressed when you're discouraged when you don't feel like getting up in the morning when you don't have any motivation Jesus will still come to you and tell you child come I want to help you just give me the chance you see another interesting thing about this story is that Jesus didn't say it was my will that thou be whole but he asked them will thou be whole you see it was the man's decision you see it's our decision Jesus is a gentleman amen he's not going to force you to do anything he's going to give you the choice because he wants to see that you actually love him you see and if this man didn't take action he would have stayed paralyzed still he would have never walked you say if if we don't take action tonight if we keep waiting day after day we're going to stay paralyzed it might not be physically it's going to be spiritually and I believe that's worse than physically because a paralyzed man could be spiritually right spiritually paralyzed is a whole different level I don't want to get to that point amen amenu you see we have to jump the hurdle of a Haven of being comfortable you see um a lot of the times we just be comfortable on the porch see there was five porches the story says and the number five means Grace you see this man was living in Grace all these people that were there were living in Grace but there comes a time we have to get out of living in that Grace for so long that situation that you're in you see your porches will build a determent or discouragement to becoming to not becoming better because we because we'll just make excuses because we'll just say oh well I'm living by Grace God had Grace for me then a year passes five years pass years this man had 38 years of just living this way because he was comfortable the next thing I think we have to jump is the hurdle blame I'm sorry the hurdle of blame you see a lot of the times we blame our parents we blame our brothers we blame our pastor we blame everyone that we could think of I even heard something today that we blame people that are already dead what are we why are we blaming people out there they're not going to come back you see we're so focused on our past on what happened when we were young what what our parents did what they didn't let us do that we start blaming everyone for the situation that we're in but in reality we should be blaming ourselves because we can't get out of that situation we're too in love with it we're too in love with the condition that we're in we're in love with the com the comfort that we're in and not in love with Jesus you see and I said we can't be living in Grace for for all that time and I wanted to read the scripture as well Romans 6 1- two and The New International Version I liked it better that it says what shall we say then question mark are we to remain in sin so that Grace may increase another question mark and it says absolutely not how how can we someone moved my notes I think it was the computer up there oh thank you how can we who died to sin still live in it see we can't live in that Grace for too long Brothers we get stuck I want to read a quote before my time ends it says can we see Jesus the or the message can we see Jesus preaching 58 and it says and I just wonder if that isn't the condition of the church tonight you are Christian people you are people who profess to know the Lord [Music] Jesus and he shook every kind of gift before you and this United States of America is supposed to be a Christian Nation and great man has crossed this nation Billy granham and or Roberts and AA Allen or or Roberts and many great ministers with great gifts and they shook it before their eyes and they sit like they are paralyzed spiritually paralyzed I wonder what God thinks about his children when he can show show them his divine presence and listen brothers and they'll still say well I'll wait till brother Allen comes by or brother Roberts or brother brandham robt and he says don't wait for them to come by see they're men Jesus is here now showing himself before you as a living God see Jesus is here tonight Brothers see we don't have to wait on our pastor we don't have to wait on brother Alex or all the ordained ministers or ministers here oh you could have it today you just have to come to Jesus with all your heart and believe with all your heart and you see it keeps saying and the church has become just staring out why we believe oh yes we believe but it's become so common to the people see Brothers we're not common people see I don't know if you're common but I don't think we're common people you see brother brandham says we're odd balls amen and he keeps saying but the Bible is saying he is the same yesterday today and forever then he has to be the same amen My Brother David could come up you see we are not common people Brothers you see Jesus is here tonight you just have to believe it with all your heart God bless brother [Applause] God bless you Brothers I would like to read James 410 real quick it says humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up today brother I would like to speak on on spiritual on spiritual paralysis now many times we fall into sin but many times when we fall into sin instead of getting up I'm sorry instead of getting up we stay down we get deeper and deeper into that hole of sin to the point where we become cold where we become cold and distant from God and brothers that shouldn't happen especially for children of God but unfortunately it happens more often and not and we become so cold and distant from God we become spiritually paralyzed and we become so deep in our sin we become comfortable and we like to stay down there we don't want to get up no more it gets so bad we become attracted to or worse than that we change our own environment to reflect our condition and that just makes it harder for us to come out of that sin to come out of that addiction that we formed that changed us and does not allow us to come out and many [Music] times can you help me sing this [Music] even I believe everyone knows this
