[19:17] [Music]
[19:31] [Music]
[19:44] this is
[19:46] a whole family
[19:53] Hermanos
[19:56] is
[19:58] a cow can follow me with you know in
[20:00] your Bibles
[20:03] says Deuteronomy chapter 23 verse three
[20:08] it's a fifth book of the Old Testament
[20:13] OS
[20:16] de California from California
[20:20] I was watching us to the internet
[20:23] it is a c and it reads like this is
[20:36] shall not enter into the congregation of
[20:38] the Lord even to their 10th Generation
[20:40] shall they and not enter into the
[20:42] congregation of the Lord forever
[20:53] and Mesopotamia
[20:56] because they met you not with bread and
[20:59] with water in the way when you came
[21:01] forth out of Egypt and because they
[21:02] hired against the Balaam the son of
[21:05] Biore of pathor of Mesopotamia to Kirsty
[21:08] is
[21:18] nevertheless the Lord thy God we're not
[21:20] hearken into Balaam but the Lord thy God
[21:22] turned the curse into a blessing Unity
[21:23] because the Lord thy God loved thee
[21:36] if you can open up to Romans chapter 8
[21:39] verse 28.
[21:44] it is the sixth book in the New
[21:46] Testament
[21:49] um
[21:55] California in California
[22:07] I think it's even more difficult for
[22:10] them
[22:12] but God covers them with his mantle
[22:15] Romanos
[22:17] Romans 8 28. is
[22:26] we know that all things work together
[22:28] for good to them that love God to them
[22:30] who are called according to his purpose
[22:32] you may be seated
[22:35] uh
[22:36] in Genesis
[22:38] in Genesis 29 verse 32
[22:43] 38. this is
[22:51] that the descendants of Moab they come
[22:53] from the incest or from incest
[22:58] from Lord's daughters
[23:02] when they get their father drunk
[23:06] and they have children by him
[23:09] foreign
[23:20] God prohibits
[23:27] they can't enter into the congregation
[23:30] of Israel they can turn to the people of
[23:32] Israel it is
[23:36] and he says he tells them that they
[23:38] shouldn't seek their peace nor their
[23:40] prosperity all the days of their lives
[23:43] and I open with this verse because
[23:47] Ruth was a moabite
[23:56] um
[23:59] it was a Commandment that God had placed
[24:05] but the grace of God is great
[24:16] when Ruth gets to Bethlehem yeah
[24:19] she gets there um at the Harvest Time
[24:29] she makes the decision to follow Noemi
[24:32] promesa
[24:36] didn't have a promise because she wasn't
[24:40] in Israelite
[24:42] a promise was foreign
[25:16] sometimes we're sitting here very
[25:18] comfortable
[25:20] thinking that everything is okay
[25:23] why because we get a customer
[25:27] Iglesia from a young age they bring us
[25:29] to church
[25:31] have to take our own decision
[25:41] when Ruth went out to the fields of
[25:44] Bethlehem yeah
[25:45] she didn't have any uh benefits she
[25:49] couldn't work
[25:52] just any job and those Deuteronomy
[25:59] um 24 19.
[26:03] God put a law down
[26:13] here
[26:21] in Harvest and thine field and has
[26:24] forgot a sheath in the field that shall
[26:26] not go again to fetch it it shall be for
[26:29] the stranger for the fatherless and for
[26:31] the Widow that the Lord thy God May
[26:33] bless thee and all thy Work of thy hands
[26:36] food so then Ruth
[26:38] she had to it's
[26:41] she had to gleam
[26:45] and she had to go pick up what was what
[26:49] was left
[26:50] a little things that are falling
[26:53] that's what she was allowed to do
[26:57] spiritual bring it to the spiritual side
[27:03] do you say oh on Friday brother it was
[27:06] his turn to preach well he doesn't bring
[27:08] so much but let me tell you
[27:12] there's a true Ruth there sitting amen
[27:15] she's gonna she's gonna grab
[27:19] every grain of the word of God
[27:23] it doesn't matter if the preacher is bad
[27:26] root was a laborer
[27:31] from night to day or day to night
[27:35] sorry bro amen
[27:37] rude
[27:39] rudos Ruth chapter two
[27:42] verse
[27:46] came from Bethlehem
[27:48] to the Reapers
[27:53] they answered him
[27:56] the Lord
[28:03] hears them yes
[28:27] and the servant who was set over the
[28:30] Reaper's answer and said is the mobile
[28:31] dandel who came back with Naomi out of
[28:34] the country of Moab
[28:36] discans
[28:49] and she said I pray you let me glean and
[28:51] gather after the Reapers among the
[28:53] sheaves so she came and has continued
[28:55] even from the morning until now except
[28:57] she carried a little in the house is
[29:08] then boy said unto Ruth here is thou not
[29:10] my daughter go not to glean in another
[29:12] field neither go from hence but abide
[29:14] here fast by my maidens
[29:17] now when you find the word of God
[29:20] you find the message of the hours
[29:23] you don't have to look for it in any
[29:26] other place
[29:28] you don't have to look for it in the
[29:30] world
[29:41] of God
[29:52] then she fell on her face and bowed
[29:54] herself to the ground and said unto him
[29:55] why have I found Grace in thine eyes
[29:57] that thou should take notice of me
[29:59] seeing I am a stranger
[30:01] is
[30:13] answering Center it have fully been
[30:15] shown to me all that thou has done unto
[30:17] thy mother-in-law since the death of
[30:19] thine husband and how thou has left thy
[30:21] father and thy mother and thy land of
[30:23] thine activity and has come unto a
[30:25] people whom thou knew is not heretofore
[30:41] from the Lord God of Israel under whose
[30:44] wings he has come to trust
[30:54] then she said let me find favor in that
[30:57] side Marlo for thou has comforted me and
[30:59] thou has spoken friendly unto thine
[31:00] handmade though I am not like one unto
[31:03] one of thine handmaids
[31:05] root didn't deserve that Grace
[31:08] Just Like Us
[31:12] represents the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:18] there were for the Gentiles
[31:37] it comes with a great message yeah this
[31:40] is
[31:42] and sometimes we say around there oh
[31:44] he's mad
[31:48] if the pastors matter or not
[31:58] and when she was risen up to glean Boaz
[32:01] commanded his young man saying let her
[32:03] glean even among the sheaves and
[32:04] reproach your knot
[32:13] and and he led for also some of the
[32:16] handfuls of purpose for her and leave
[32:18] them that she may glean them and rebuke
[32:20] her not
[32:22] sometimes a pastor comes with a great
[32:24] message
[32:25] a majority of the times
[32:28] and those are they're those little
[32:31] sheaves
[32:32] the little grains of the word
[32:36] by the order of God
[32:39] he's telling the the reaper every
[33:18] [Music]
[33:38] or she would give to her to her
[33:40] mother-in-law as well
[33:43] what are we doing with the word
[33:46] those handfuls that the Lord allows to
[33:49] fall
[33:57] Ruth 3-1
[34:08] the Naomi her mother-in-law said unto
[34:11] her my daughter shall I not seek rest
[34:12] really that it may be well with thee is
[34:23] and now is not Boaz of our Kindred with
[34:25] whose maidens thou worst be holy winner

[35:01] shall lie and thou shalt go in and
[35:03] uncover his feet and lay thee down and
[35:05] he will tell thee what Thou shalt do
[35:07] yeah
[35:10] and she said unto her all that thou says
[35:13] unto me I will do this
[35:18] and she went down onto the floor and did
[35:20] according to all that her mother-in-law
[35:22] paid

[35:39] uncovered his feet and lay herself down
[35:42] we see The Obedience of Ruth here

[39:50] husband's side
[39:54] a man of standing from the clan of
[39:56] elimelech
[39:58] whose name was Boaz

[40:08] let me go to the fields
[40:15] and pick up the leftover grain behind
[40:17] anyone in whose eyes I found favor
[40:20] foreign
[41:00] [Music]

[43:52] because
[44:03] a passion to serve Christ
[44:06] to worship him
[44:13] [Applause]
[44:19] that is of his word
[44:26] while she was in Moab
[44:29] but let me tell you as
[44:33] um
[44:44] if the Book of Ruth wasn't foreign
[45:23] let's give glory to God for the Book of
[45:25] Ruth
[45:28] is
[45:30] a story
[45:32] it's a book it's a story of love
[45:37] in the old
[45:42] testamento boss
[45:44] es
[46:03] it had to be someone of of a Kingsman
[46:08] it had to be a Kingsman by blood
[46:11] pressure to be a redeemer
[46:15] he also has to pay whatever the price
[46:18] was
[46:19] and and to be able to do it
[46:23] not just be able to do it
[46:27] because
[46:35] I want to praise God
[46:41] amen amen
[46:44] I don't know if you can put the time
[46:46] okay
[46:56] it's found also in the New Testament
[46:59] The Book of John says
[47:03] that the verb became
[47:26] a servant of God
[47:29] it says
[47:32] here's a great place
[47:38] in Israel someone who can redeem a lost
[47:40] estate
[48:10] that's right
[48:13] the only way it could be flesh
[48:27] [Music]
[49:00] by his grace
[49:03] foreign
[49:28] amen
[50:12] that men
[50:15] they wanted to become Kings
[50:18] and the Kings wanted to become God
[50:22] wanted to be a man
[50:52] in our life
[51:25] his glory
[51:28] for his glory excuse me
[51:32] God paid the price
[51:36] you paid the price everything that was
[51:39] due
[51:41] he said his blood for you and die
[51:50] sometimes we just need to have an
[51:52] encounter with Our Redeemer
[51:56] and it's time to know who we are yeah
[51:59] amen
[52:01] Elizabeth
[52:03] sent me a preaching dangerous
[52:09] um dangerous
[52:10] and the preacher said
[52:13] when one knows who you are when you know
[52:16] who you are
[52:18] you become a danger to the devil
[52:23] you become a threat to yourself
[52:32] instead of us to him
[52:38] for the glory of God Amen God bless you
[52:46] foreign
[52:46] [Applause]
[53:53] someone that is punished
[53:58] but I like the way our Pastor said last
[54:01] time
[54:03] something has been lost
[54:07] returns it or restores it is
[54:26] but because that thing is
[54:41] it's already theirs
[54:44] yeah animals have yours we were already
[54:46] Gods you hear the price
[54:51] every one of us say amen amen
[54:54] what a beautiful story they already said
[54:58] yes
[55:03] this night I like to focus on one of the
[55:05] points our brother
[55:07] mentions in the message Kinsmen Redeemer
[55:10] El Capitol
[55:16] was decided
[55:19] in chapter two he says
[55:23] chapter 3 he says Ruth descans resting
[55:29] Ruth chapter four
[55:32] amen
[55:38] our brothers
[55:44] foreign
[57:18] sometimes you do things
[57:21] that for other people they say that's
[57:23] too much
[57:24] that's enough
[57:27] but for the love of God
[57:30] that he had towards us he gave us the
[57:34] best
[57:35] he gives us the best we have the best
[57:40] and being the Ruth
[57:44] appreciating everything we have yes
[57:47] because we know that we don't deserve
[57:49] anything we have we don't deserve the
[57:51] life
[57:55] for many times
[58:03] we get used to having it
[58:08] if they take your phone for a day
[58:12] you'll find out how valuable it is
[58:24] appreciate it when you have it yeah
[58:30] she shows it every time amen amen
[58:35] God bless his word
[58:38] condo
[58:40] images
[58:51] the first time he sees Ruth
[58:56] how perfect God's timing was
[59:01] because he had to place that time
[59:23] has been a type of price
[59:34] he saw something
[59:36] not a wife
[1:00:33] listen to anything for herself
[1:00:39] I
[1:01:41] it wasn't in the future to be seen by
[1:01:44] the rest she went
[1:01:47] because there was an elderly woman
[1:01:52] they showed her a life
[1:01:55] compared to her own life
[1:01:58] yeah she said I want something that she
[1:02:01] said
[1:02:05] Naomi from Bethlehem Romero album
[1:02:16] welcome to this message
[1:02:41] and that's why
[1:03:00] I speak for myself
[1:03:05] that we have men and women
[1:03:09] that love us
[1:03:12] and call us daughter and
[1:03:15] want the best for us
[1:03:20] to offer the best
[1:03:23] why not be thankful for that
[1:03:27] thankful that they push us forward
[1:03:29] to do things yeah
[1:03:32] maybe look old-fashioned
[1:03:37] everything that Naomi was talking about
[1:03:41] teaching her her Traditions
[1:03:44] things old-fashioned things we could
[1:03:47] call them
[1:03:52] something true
[1:04:03] and that's why we're all here
[1:04:06] or why are you here this night
[1:04:10] just because you want to come just to
[1:04:13] come
[1:04:14] in English there's many having Church
[1:04:17] there's many worshiping God
[1:04:20] but
[1:04:21] there's only one truth
[1:04:24] and there's only something
[1:04:26] that should be true
[1:04:29] and what is true
[1:04:33] amen amen
[1:05:00] this message
[1:05:04] says
[1:05:43] although it's not written in the letter
[1:05:46] you say okay I know what she actually
[1:05:49] means
[1:05:53] and thanks to God that we have what our
[1:05:55] Prophet brought us
[1:06:00] so look beyond what the story of Ruth
[1:06:03] really means
[1:06:13] went there in the first program first
[1:06:16] one
[1:06:22] how has Boaz come riding out there in
[1:06:25] that Carriage looking around over the
[1:06:26] fields say
[1:06:31] and his eyes fell on Ruth
[1:06:34] he was a mess
[1:06:42] and she found Grace in his Society
[1:06:46] the eyes of Our Lord foreign
[1:07:02] [Music]
[1:07:20] but how do we treat the best
[1:07:44] [Applause]
[1:07:50] looking for individuals
[1:08:07] that's what he wants
[1:08:29] he wants to give to us
[1:08:33] why not take it
[1:08:35] why not appreciate it
[1:08:37] amen
[1:08:41] ities
[1:08:46] it was love at first sight
[1:09:04] if we can take something
[1:09:08] implemented
[1:09:09] is to Simply Be Thankful for can see
[1:09:13] because actually
[1:09:27] and actually it was only for Naomi yes
[1:09:38] typifies the Jews
[1:09:41] the message our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:44] was for the Jews
[1:09:47] for us the Gentiles
[1:09:50] we didn't deserve an opportunity
[1:09:53] so come and ask for forgiveness
[1:09:58] deserve the opportunity
[1:10:00] to come and worship God
[1:10:04] it was actually for the Jews
[1:10:39] that's what Ruth showed Boaz
[1:10:43] what the people saw in roof
[1:10:47] okay boss because Boaz
[1:10:50] is
[1:10:56] going to look foreign
[1:11:39] and that's the reason
[1:11:44] Boaz was ready to pay that price
[1:11:48] remember
[1:11:51] when Naomi and Ruth arrived to
[1:11:54] bethlehempo
[1:11:58] is they arrived in a time of scarcity
[1:12:05] maybe the people wouldn't give anything
[1:12:07] for them
[1:12:08] maybe the people were criticizing
[1:12:12] how many times have they judged us
[1:12:16] maybe speaking about us
[1:12:23] not only do they speak well about Ruth
[1:12:25] against Ruth telling Boaz
[1:12:29] don't do it
[1:12:31] but gay why hurt
[1:12:34] my question for you tonight is
[1:12:38] why did it please
[1:12:40] to redeem us
[1:12:46] there are better people out there
[1:12:50] are consecrated more dedicated
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:56] but that didn't matter to him
[1:12:59] the great buildings didn't matter
[1:13:03] to him if you could sing well or not
[1:13:08] let's implement the the middle he simply
[1:13:11] saw you memito saw me
[1:13:15] and saw something
[1:13:19] that was worth redeeming
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:23] maybe you don't see it
[1:13:27] you'll never see it in my life
[1:13:29] [Music]
[1:13:32] he made that decision for every one of
[1:13:35] us
[1:13:37] and he didn't think twice
[1:13:40] [Music]
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:13] [Music]
[1:14:15] because no one else could love me the
[1:14:18] way he does

[1:14:24] to Naomi brothers
[1:14:27] and brother Brown says that was the
[1:14:29] devil for us
[1:14:31] [Music]
[1:14:39] [Music]
[1:14:41] he didn't love us forgive me and it's by
[1:14:43] God's love
