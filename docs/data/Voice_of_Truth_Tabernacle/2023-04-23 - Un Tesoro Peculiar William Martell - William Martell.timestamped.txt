[23:34] Greeley and and uh and from Denver
[23:37] International
[23:39] I thank them for coming as well
[23:44] for the invitation this morning
[23:49] I know it's been a while since I've been
[23:51] here
[23:53] I was trying to remember I think it was
[23:55] about five years is what we kind of
[23:56] concluded
[23:59] a lot of buildings been going on yeah
[24:03] but I got to enjoy part of the service
[24:06] this morning
[24:09] and I see a lot of building going on
[24:12] yeah
[24:13] I believe the word of God is abundant
[24:17] and the edification of the body of
[24:20] Christ is
[24:21] prevalented
[24:24] I don't want to keep you standing for a
[24:26] long time so if you take and turn with
[24:28] me in your Bible
[24:31] to the Book of Exodus chapter 19
[24:36] we're going to take four verses verses
[24:38] three through six
[24:41] and it reads like this
[24:44] and Moses went up unto God
[24:47] and the Lord called unto him out of the
[24:50] mountain saying thus shalt thou say to
[24:53] the house of Jacob and tell the children
[24:56] of Israel Israel
[25:05] ye have seen what I did unto the
[25:08] Egyptians and how I bear You On Eagle's
[25:11] Wings and brought you unto myself
[25:21] now therefore if ye will obey my voice
[25:25] indeed and keep my Covenant then ye
[25:28] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[25:31] above all people for all the Earth is
[25:34] mine voice
[25:45] and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of
[25:47] priests and an holy nation these are the
[25:50] words which Thou shalt speak unto the
[25:52] children of Israel
[25:59] let us pray
[26:00] gracious Heavenly Father
[26:03] Lord we thank you Lord once again for
[26:06] your mercy and Grace this morning
[26:09] we thank you for providing a place for
[26:12] us Lord to meet in thy divine presence
[26:17] we ask Lord as we have taken a portion
[26:20] of thy words
[26:27] [Music]
[26:28] and open it up Lord and give us the
[26:32] context Lord
[26:34] bless each one that believes Thy word
[26:37] father
[26:38] and if there are any here Lord that do
[26:40] not know you Lord or or and and your
[26:43] word Lord
[26:46] may they come to know you today
[26:49] we commit ourselves to you Lord in this
[26:52] time of service
[26:54] asking for forgiveness of our
[26:56] shortcomings
[26:58] that there'll be no hindrance lord of
[27:01] the moving of thy Spirit
[27:05] speak to us now Lord as only you can
[27:07] Senor
[27:09] for we commit ourselves to you asking
[27:11] you these things
[27:13] in the precious name of Jesus Christ
[27:18] amen amen you may be seated
[27:25] I'd like to read once again
[27:28] verse 5. and from this particular verse
[27:33] we're going to draw our title this
[27:37] morning
[27:39] and Moses writes
[27:42] one more time Moses right
[27:45] and and it's said here
[27:48] now therefore
[27:50] if ye obey my voice indeed
[27:55] and keep my Covenant
[27:57] then ye shall be a peculiar treasure
[28:01] vosotros me Especial
[28:03] unto me above all people
[28:06] for all the Earth is mine
[28:10] I like to title this morning's message
[28:17] there are many things that we can say
[28:20] this morning but time does not permit
[28:24] so I'll just try to hit high points
[28:29] but as we believe in what God is doing
[28:32] in our day
[28:34] he has a Ministry that he uses
[28:38] these are the Servants of God yes they
[28:42] don't lift them
[29:01] so we rely upon the word of God
[29:05] we rely upon the spirit of
[29:28] in my own studies
[29:31] and when I am inspired on a particular
[29:34] message
[29:37] I use that sermon as my my reference
[29:40] point
[29:42] so many times I'll have quotes from that
[29:45] sermon
[29:48] what I like to do is I like to give
[29:50] those sermons
[29:53] because the children of God do not just
[29:56] eat the word of God on Sundays
[30:00] the Believers do not just trust God one
[30:04] day out of the week
[30:07] we do not just look for the spiritual
[30:09] food and due season
[30:11] one day out of the week
[30:16] so we like to make time to Feast on the
[30:20] word of God throughout the week
[30:24] so there's two sermons the first sermon
[30:28] is 5308 31.
[30:33] titled God talk to Moses
[30:38] the second sermon is
[30:40] 6005-15 yes
[30:45] the rejected King
[30:48] I'd like to title this morning's message
[30:51] did I give the title already
[30:54] peculiar A peculiar treasure
[30:57] and just for the background now but uh
[31:00] uh
[31:02] we see that that Moses is having a
[31:06] conversation with god
[31:10] this is after after they have come out
[31:12] of Egypt
[31:14] how many knows that Moses was the
[31:16] servant of God
[31:18] the beliefs that Moses existed
[31:22] nobody ever met Moses in here
[31:26] you don't see this actually happening
[31:29] but yet your faith believes
[31:37] as we see this story unfolds
[31:42] I want to lay this foundation for this
[31:45] message this morning
[31:49] that when when God is speaking to Moses
[31:53] that there were many experiences that
[31:56] Moses had before God spoke to Moses
[32:01] before God spoke to Moses out of the
[32:04] burning bushes
[32:08] and there was a reason why the burning
[32:11] bush happened
[32:15] the experience of The Burning Bush was
[32:17] set for Moses
[32:21] but God had this plan to speak to Moses
[32:25] All Along
[32:27] we heard a little bit about the plan
[32:30] this morning
[32:33] this has always been part of the planet
[32:36] for God
[32:39] forgot to have an expression
[32:43] and as Moses is is growing up in the
[32:47] land of Egypt
[32:49] I want to emphasize that he was not
[32:52] Egyptian
[32:54] he grew up amongst the Egyptians
[33:05] where he realized he was somebody else
[33:09] from another
[33:28] [Music]
[34:08] it was never supposed to be that
[34:12] but we do have a god this morning
[34:15] and if you're still in bondage this is
[34:26] so Moses God is dealing with Moses Anton
[34:30] says
[34:32] and he he notices something on a
[34:36] mountain
[34:37] and he sees a bush that is burning but
[34:40] is not consumed
[34:45] so he recognizes the light
[34:50] and that's what is attracting him yes
[35:00] and he doesn't know
[35:05] so he realizes he's got to get a little
[35:08] closer
[35:10] for him to get a little closer
[35:14] stop what he's doing
[35:26] see what this bush that doesn't burn is
[35:33] not being consumed
[35:37] so he starts
[36:02] because the servant of God is not taking
[36:04] the people of God
[36:07] to a different place of experience
[36:12] is the same place
[36:24] [Applause]
[36:26] God calls him
[36:28] so God speaks to him first in his heart
[36:32] just like God spoke to us
[36:39] Puerta
[36:43] we walked into a church service and
[36:45] heard the preaching of the word
[36:48] and it was the word of which is God
[36:51] speaking to our hearts yes
[37:06] then we begin to hear God
[37:10] and that's what happened with Moses
[37:12] they step they they have left now Egypt
[37:18] but I want you to understand something
[37:21] greater in the Servants of God
[37:24] that when God speaks to one of his
[37:27] servants
[37:29] most of the time
[37:33] it is
[37:38] for the benefit of who he's the
[37:40] messenger too as far as
[37:42] Hittle so God is speaking to Moses
[37:47] speaking to his heart
[37:50] benefited Moses
[37:52] from the burning bush
[37:55] that benefited Moses
[37:58] from the mountains that benefited Moses
[38:03] but it was for the children
[38:07] so all this is going on
[38:11] Ministry and calling of Moses
[38:22] amen amen
[38:24] it was for the benefit of the people of
[38:26] god
[38:28] let's take our text
[38:31] so he tells Moses that he calls Moses
[38:35] and he says this is what I want you to
[38:38] say to the house of Jacob
[38:41] tell the children of Israel
[38:44] that ye have seen what I I did unto the
[38:48] Egyptians
[38:50] you see the children of Israel were
[38:53] Witnesses
[38:55] of the power of God
[38:57] they were Witnesses of the Miracles
[39:02] they were Witnesses because they were
[39:05] there
[39:10] experiencing this firsthand
[39:14] this is why the gospel many times we can
[39:17] relate
[39:28] and we begin to identify with this word
[39:31] that's been increments
[39:36] now he's pointing out now
[39:39] that that you saw what I did to the
[39:42] Egyptians
[39:44] what what God did
[40:11] [Music]
[40:31] listen now
[40:35] God Specializes especially in those
[40:39] things not impossible
[40:42] it was an impossible appearance
[40:47] wow the Israel's in trouble now
[40:50] problems
[40:53] oh wow this this man or this woman or
[40:56] this child is in trouble
[40:59] what are they going to get out of this
[41:04] same way Israel got out of it is
[41:09] what God did to the Egyptians
[41:12] amen he says you saw what I did unto the
[41:16] Egyptians
[41:17] how did I bear you upon
[41:26] now somewhere along the line here in
[41:29] Exodus
[41:31] and I I I believe it it uh I don't have
[41:34] it written down
[41:36] but there is a passage of text that God
[41:39] says to Israel
[41:44] that your enemies if you'll obey my
[41:46] voice
[41:50] will be my enemies
[41:53] your adversaries will be my side this is
[41:57] what God is showing the children of
[41:59] Israel with the Egyptians
[42:03] didn't start out as their enemies
[42:12] they weren't enemies
[42:20] but then there arose a pharaoh who knew
[42:22] not Joseph
[42:32] and that's what drew the people of God
[42:35] into slavery yes
[42:39] and if you notice laws that get passed
[42:42] and things that we have to deal with yes
[42:52] they don't have a relationship
[42:58] mandatos
[43:11] so he says your enemies are going to be
[43:13] my enemies
[43:30] took everything
[43:33] everything
[43:35] [Music]
[43:42] we we can't foreign
[43:52] to go worship God
[43:58] and they back themselves up against the
[44:00] Red Sea yes
[44:01] [Applause]
[44:04] and this is what I really like
[44:09] God is he's he's the ultimate
[44:12] strategisters
[44:18] he he have to read how do you say it
[44:21] like re-plan ET
[44:24] like plan a and plan B
[44:27] and the plan a doesn't work then we go
[44:29] to plan
[44:30] bunches
[44:35] and we don't need another guy
[44:38] the plan is the word of God
[44:48] and as they're ladder their their backs
[44:50] are against us
[44:55] and they're facing towards where God's
[44:58] leading them yes
[45:05] [Music]
[45:07] foreign
[46:07] foreign
[46:35] but God is speaking to him he's saying
[46:37] come down
[46:45] today God does battle for you
[46:50] because they were being led into the
[46:52] Wilderness
[47:12] he put himself
[47:14] between his children
[47:33] the kingdom of God is
[47:37] the children of God
[47:41] and the cloud is standing stand between
[47:43] the children of Israel
[47:47] Egyptians
[47:51] from the Egyptians
[47:57] that separates us from the agility
[48:07] the cloud was not for the Egyptians
[48:20] from the Egyptians
[48:23] amen amen
[48:28] the Egyptian Egypt was a type of the
[48:31] world
[48:32] and in this type
[48:35] the Egyptians the the the the people of
[48:39] Egypt
[48:41] were chasing after Israelites
[48:45] chasing after the people of God
[48:51] now when they were in Egypt
[48:56] but when they came out of Egypt
[48:59] the Church of God
[49:05] so the Egyptians were chasing after the
[49:08] Church of God
[49:16] and the enemy chases after the Church of
[49:18] God
[49:22] and when it chases after them
[49:24] it is not because it's your friend
[49:28] he just was chasing after Israel
[49:35] to score them
[49:37] and to kill them
[49:48] it is
[50:04] surrender
[50:06] to the leadership of God
[50:08] because when you're doing what God tells
[50:11] you to do
[50:30] if you understand
[50:34] to calm you when you're Restless
[50:43] amen amen I want to read a quote una
[50:48] Sita
[50:51] from the message of the hour
[50:54] God talked to Moses
[50:58] 5308-31
[51:02] and and it reads like this now remember
[51:05] Egypt is the world
[51:07] and the children of Israel are the
[51:10] Church of God
[51:12] the world
[51:15] is behind them
[51:19] we're facing towards the word right
[51:23] fulfillment of the promises of God
[51:28] we're facing we're being part of the
[51:30] plan of God
[51:34] brother Branham says now the world is
[51:37] looking for good mixers
[51:41] but God's looking for separators
[51:45] for those who will separate themselves
[51:50] I'm gonna pause right there that's just
[51:53] like Moses
[51:56] nobody the Egyptians didn't teach him
[51:59] you know what you should go back to your
[52:00] people and say yeah
[52:03] you should start living right now
[52:08] you should do what's right
[52:27] that's what pulls you let's look at Ohio
[52:30] State it's not a different God
[52:34] it is
[52:44] the pool was from the inside and
[52:48] he made a decision
[52:50] because of the word that was coming to
[52:53] him
[52:54] that you and how many knows what it is
[52:57] first before God gives his word it's a
[53:01] thought yes
[53:03] yes we begin to think a little bit
[53:07] differently
[53:08] if I could just get a little closer
[53:14] sir but if it stays with the word
[53:17] that's the word of God it's the thought
[53:21] of God
[53:22] you can't come back
[53:30] so God's looking for separation
[53:33] for those that will separate themselves
[53:51] while we were yet sinners
[53:59] before we even confessed
[54:02] the sacrifice was already made sure
[54:07] in Egypt the lamb was offered
[54:11] God Made A Difference
[54:15] he made the difference
[54:18] he separated the Israelites
[54:25] he separated us from the Gentiles
[54:30] we are called to be a separated
[54:37] and made the difference in them
[54:40] and God's people is a separated
[54:45] a holy Nations
[54:54] so the world
[54:56] will never understand
[55:08] get over it
[55:13] septelo you never be like the world
[55:16] because you were made for you
[55:26] [Applause]
[55:29] so just don't think about the world
[55:34] think about God
[55:36] that's the main thing
[55:39] watch this
[55:43] oh man
[55:46] he tells Moses hey lady someone says to
[55:49] tell this to the children of Israel
[55:51] Israel and he says that that see what I
[55:55] did to the Egyptians
[56:01] On Eagle's Wings
[56:10] do you remember the wings
[56:13] right do you remember the wings
[56:16] the prophet taught us it was Old
[56:18] Testament and New testamento
[56:23] the prophet taught us that the law
[56:26] is a shadow of things to come
[56:31] so even in the symbol that God is using
[56:34] to speak to the children of Israel
[56:39] of God in the Old Testament that new
[56:45] testamento Just Like Us in the New
[56:47] Testament
[56:48] we identify God and his people and what
[56:51] he's done
[56:57] they in the old testamento always looked
[57:02] for something that God was going to do
[57:04] in the future
[57:07] brothers and sisters
[57:09] we are the future
[57:13] we are these this this new testament
[57:16] Bros
[57:25] somebody's going to fulfill that
[57:27] might as well be me
[57:30] as well be one of them
[57:32] if you stay with the word
[57:38] the Old and New Testament
[57:41] what did he bring them to do
[57:46] Moses didn't bring them to another
[57:48] Nation
[57:50] he brought them to the Mount of God
[57:53] he brought them to the place where he
[57:56] had a personal experience with God
[58:00] experience our Prophet said that no man
[58:04] deserves to be behind this sacred desk
[58:06] experience
[58:16] amazing
[58:18] but as we've heard
[58:20] all the children of God have got to have
[58:23] a burning bush experience
[58:26] experience is not limited to the
[58:29] ministry
[58:32] God didn't just want to speak to Moses
[58:37] he used Moses to speak to Israel says
[58:42] the friends to the bridegrooms
[58:46] you know they just don't whatever it is
[58:49] in the natural don't have the nerves
[58:54] you know she said hi to me
[58:58] everybody
[59:01] she shook my hand
[59:03] she's in line shaking everybody's head
[59:06] I know but this was different
[59:11] what is that
[59:14] something on the inside
[59:21] right
[59:23] and the word that God gives
[59:26] was for the children of Israel
[59:29] Israel I mean this is the great part of
[59:32] it to me
[59:34] Moses isn't excluded
[59:37] he's one of the members of the children
[59:39] of Israel
[59:43] that's right and when he's giving this
[59:45] word
[59:47] the word of God
[59:49] Moses is saying exactly what God is
[59:52] saying to him
[59:55] when you read a little bit better it
[59:58] tells you it tells you how he did it
[1:00:01] Moses being the prophet of God
[1:00:03] messenger of the days
[1:00:11] the Church of God Grande
[1:00:17] as Moses going to speak to every member
[1:00:19] of the church Israel
[1:00:27] but what did he do but okay he was
[1:00:29] called so he decided to return the
[1:00:32] gesture Anton says
[1:00:35] and he called the elders
[1:00:38] and they weren't just any Elders
[1:00:41] the Elders of the people
[1:00:46] they didn't have any other ulterior
[1:00:48] motives
[1:00:49] one more time
[1:00:51] ulterior motives they didn't have any
[1:00:53] other uh plans
[1:00:55] motivos another plan they didn't have a
[1:00:58] different place
[1:00:59] they were just going to say the same
[1:01:01] thing that Moses told them to say
[1:01:06] so they call the children of Israel and
[1:01:09] they repeat the same thing Anton says
[1:01:14] looking for a different message
[1:01:32] Lord
[1:01:35] God amen amen look it figures he says
[1:01:41] now therefore this
[1:01:47] if ye will obey my voice indeed
[1:01:52] now this isn't just obey my voice
[1:01:58] may my voice indeed
[1:02:03] so it isn't just like say amen
[1:02:07] amen it isn't just like I agree with
[1:02:10] this
[1:02:12] it is it just that I I could see what
[1:02:15] he's saying
[1:02:17] but indeed
[1:02:21] is to do what it says
[1:02:29] it's to do it
[1:02:32] to obey my voice indeed
[1:02:38] prove that you're obeying the voice
[1:02:42] whose voice is it
[1:02:45] come on depends on what's being said
[1:02:48] depends
[1:02:50] and the anointing behind it
[1:03:16] this word
[1:03:18] is
[1:03:25] amen
[1:03:54] amen amen
[1:03:56] obey my voice indeed
[1:03:59] all right
[1:04:01] and keep my Covenant
[1:04:04] now this is important
[1:04:08] that is
[1:04:11] as God is giving his word
[1:04:15] he's giving it to Moses to give to the
[1:04:18] elders and the children of Israel
[1:04:22] so it's important that God trusts the
[1:04:24] man that he's giving the message
[1:04:42] now that friend has got to make a
[1:04:44] judgment call All right
[1:04:47] we don't just want anybody to interfere
[1:04:51] with this this scene
[1:04:55] this circumstance
[1:04:57] so who he gives it to as a friend
[1:05:02] has also got to be worthy men to keep
[1:05:05] with the same message that his friend
[1:05:07] first gave me
[1:05:13] God doesn't doesn't change his mind
[1:05:15] about his work
[1:05:17] this is why his voice is so important
[1:05:20] foreign
[1:05:48] and in this plan God sees it all yes
[1:05:51] and what we are seeing before our very
[1:05:54] eyes
[1:06:01] they can't redo the Old Testament
[1:06:05] coming out of Egypt
[1:06:10] so God confirmed
[1:06:13] amen
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:48] it's spoken about you
[1:06:52] this is the word of God is fulfilled in
[1:06:55] your day before your very eyes
[1:07:05] members in particulars that are supposed
[1:07:09] to have this word fulfilled in their
[1:07:11] lives
[1:07:21] that means don't discard it
[1:07:26] don't discard the Covenant that I've
[1:07:28] giveness
[1:07:30] don't discard the Covenant that I agreed
[1:07:34] to no service
[1:07:38] well how long is it going to take
[1:07:39] brother Williams
[1:07:43] yes sir God's timing is perfect
[1:07:52] I'm good with it um
[1:08:12] amen
[1:08:27] amen amen amen look at how important it
[1:08:29] is to stay with the word
[1:08:32] we we it's important to say what the
[1:08:36] word says
[1:08:38] thousands of years hundreds of years
[1:08:40] later
[1:08:43] we see the psalmist David
[1:08:49] writing a song
[1:08:51] and in this song
[1:08:56] 135 4 El salmos
[1:08:59] for the Lord hath chosen Jacob
[1:09:04] unto himself
[1:09:09] and Israel Israel for his peculiar
[1:09:14] treasure
[1:09:17] Generations later
[1:09:21] King David
[1:09:23] is holding on to the same words
[1:09:38] but he's keeping the Covenant that God
[1:09:41] gave us
[1:09:46] but speaking the covenants
[1:09:50] keeping it in the
[1:09:53] forefronto put it on a shelf and store
[1:09:56] it away
[1:10:01] amen amen and it's the same plan for us
[1:10:05] today
[1:10:06] the only difference is the dispensations
[1:10:23] [Music]
[1:10:30] and we find and pick it up
[1:10:33] in the new
[1:10:35] testamento the New Testament isn't
[1:10:37] listen to this brothers and sisters
[1:10:39] it isn't a different word
[1:10:44] it isn't a different God
[1:10:47] it's a different dispensation
[1:10:57] first Peter 2 9.
[1:11:01] but ye are a chosen generation
[1:11:05] yes sir a royal priesthood
[1:11:08] Unholy Nations
[1:11:20] what does it mean to be peculiar okay
[1:11:23] significance
[1:11:24] basic definition means not ordinary
[1:11:27] definition
[1:11:30] anybody ever feel like they're odd
[1:11:34] like not ordinary
[1:11:36] I'm just not like everybody else
[1:11:40] God knows you know what God's not like
[1:11:44] all the other so-called Gods out there
[1:11:46] in Egypt either
[1:11:59] he brought him to himself
[1:12:02] Peter says that he should show forth
[1:12:06] the Praises of him who called you
[1:12:13] it's the same word it's the same God
[1:12:16] cause
[1:12:46] to show forth his purpose
[1:12:54] to reveal irrever
[1:12:58] his praises
[1:13:00] to reveal the Praises of him that has
[1:13:04] called you today
[1:13:19] Pueblo
[1:13:42] we worship God because of an experience
[1:13:47] not just because we just I was raised in
[1:13:50] church so I just raised my hands
[1:13:53] because we're identified identified
[1:14:18] it's not even the way we dress
[1:14:21] it's not even the way we worship
[1:14:24] what makes us peculiar
[1:14:27] is what causes us to do those things
[1:14:35] an experience with God
[1:14:38] coming out of Egypt
[1:14:41] and he called them out
[1:14:44] of Darkness
[1:14:46] into his marvelous life
[1:14:52] out of Darkness
[1:14:54] into his marvelous life
[1:15:00] out of Darkness
[1:15:02] into His Marvelous
[1:15:07] I said this to a man the other day
[1:15:10] and I'm going to close with this
[1:15:12] as I was speaking to this man
[1:15:16] I got on to talking about the
[1:15:19] peculiarity of God's people
[1:15:25] it's it's God himself
[1:15:29] but it's not like God himself over there
[1:15:34] it's God himself in his people
[1:15:37] his people having fellowship with him
[1:15:45] and I I I told him I says and this is
[1:15:49] the power of God
[1:15:52] the way that he he likes to show himself
[1:15:56] how he has chosen Israel
[1:15:59] or chosen the church
[1:16:04] his word to them
[1:16:07] and you know first we're like Moses
[1:16:11] you see God got his attention
[1:16:14] that's why he left Egypt
[1:16:17] but he wasn't on the mountain when he
[1:16:19] left Egypt
[1:16:21] he wasn't in the presence of God when he
[1:16:24] left Egypt
[1:16:31] who made the decisions
[1:16:40] he heard our Prophet say it took 40
[1:16:42] years for Egypt to put in him
[1:16:48] how to be a good Egyptian
[1:16:53] yeah see he was a good Egyptian
[1:16:58] but he was an Egyptian could you imagine
[1:17:01] if you really figured out who he was and
[1:17:03] what he was going to be like
[1:17:06] if he was a good Egyptian
[1:17:09] and he realized he's a child of God
[1:17:14] how much when he knows where he's really
[1:17:17] supposed to be
[1:17:32] and this light is shining in a bush yes
[1:17:39] but the light is calling him
[1:17:41] not with an audible voice
[1:17:45] but with interest
[1:17:48] with inspiration on inspiration with
[1:17:51] with a a an emotion
[1:17:54] consentimiento of Faith they're fair
[1:17:57] that I I need to turn aside and see what
[1:17:59] that's about
[1:18:02] he had to believe he could he could get
[1:18:04] there before it went out
[1:18:06] I believe that he I however long it's
[1:18:09] going to take for me to get there I'm
[1:18:11] going to keep my eye on it I'm going to
[1:18:12] I'm keep I'm going towards it
[1:18:16] and God knowing the whole time that he
[1:18:18] was going to talk to Moses
[1:18:26] oh he saw what he didn't say hey look
[1:18:28] there's God in the form of the pillar of
[1:18:30] fire there in the bush
[1:18:32] he didn't say that he was like man
[1:18:36] there's this bush that's burning
[1:18:39] I did surely everything I've been doing
[1:18:41] has been for a reason
[1:18:45] right over there
[1:18:51] it's not being consumed
[1:18:53] I gotta check this out
[1:19:00] foreign
[1:19:28] for the ground that you stand on
[1:19:31] is Holy Ground Santa is that's the same
[1:19:37] grounds of time
[1:19:39] give you yourself stood on Monday

[1:19:51] me
[1:19:53] you took off your shoes
[1:20:03] Dios
[1:20:09] Hallelujah
[1:20:13] The Peculiar treasure El Tesoro special
[1:20:16] is a treasure that is possessed or owned
[1:20:19] by someone
[1:20:23] and this peculiar treasure that Israel
[1:20:26] is yes
[1:20:28] is owned by the same person as as
[1:20:34] the Bride of Jesus Christ is owned by
[1:20:38] La Novia de Jesus Christ we are A
[1:20:41] peculiar people
[1:20:43] it means an acquisition
[1:20:47] something that has been purchased
[1:20:51] and we are told in our Bible that we are
[1:20:54] not our own
[1:21:01] that price was Ultimate yes
[1:21:04] where God sold everything that he has
[1:21:08] he gave up everything that he has
[1:21:13] as God couldn't change
[1:21:16] even though he gave everything up
[1:21:19] even though he became a man
[1:21:22] he should not stop being God
[1:21:25] because he doesn't change
[1:21:31] he left eternity
[1:21:35] Elohim Elohim the position of almighty
[1:21:38] God
[1:21:41] he left that to begin creation
[1:21:46] but it didn't change
[1:21:49] and that was God wasn't done
[1:21:53] he saw a man fall
[1:21:56] he saw the whole purpose of creating
[1:22:00] and he says I got to make this right
[1:22:04] I've always wanted to have fellowship
[1:22:06] with them
[1:22:08] to have fellowship with them
[1:22:13] to save them
[1:22:16] now I could do it from up here
[1:22:19] but I really want them to know how much
[1:22:21] I really care important
[1:22:27] I'm gonna go where they are
[1:22:33] right where you are
[1:22:37] many of us hit rock bottoms
[1:22:41] right where we were is
[1:22:46] he wasn't so holy he says oh man them
[1:22:49] people are messed up
[1:22:55] yes Lord
[1:23:00] they got problems
[1:23:03] yes Lord SI senor
[1:23:06] where else could I go but
[1:23:10] [Music]
[1:23:12] and watch what he says even the world
[1:23:15] tried to
[1:23:17] condemned that was caught in the very
[1:23:19] Act of sin right woman
[1:23:31] where's thine accusers
[1:23:39] they're gone
[1:23:42] neither do I condemn you know
[1:23:45] the very one that could have condemned
[1:23:49] and he didn't condemnon
[1:23:52] now I don't know if all of you can
[1:23:54] identify with what I'm saying
[1:23:57] but I want to say this
[1:24:00] right where you are
[1:24:02] if you will answer the call that God has
[1:24:05] put in your life
[1:24:08] regardless of what you've gone through
[1:24:11] regardless of your circumstances
[1:24:14] if you will just answer the call
[1:24:18] knows how to deal with it
[1:24:21] knows where he has you
[1:24:24] may not be called for this position or
[1:24:27] this other positions
[1:24:39] God's place that he called me foreign
[1:24:52] don't wait any longer but leave
[1:25:27] all that he's provided for you
[1:25:32] with every headbound
[1:25:37] if you're here this morning
[1:25:40] and you know now
[1:25:42] maybe you heard something about the
[1:25:45] grace of God
[1:25:47] but now you're beginning to experience
[1:25:49] the grace of God
[1:25:52] you're facing towards the lights
[1:25:58] the call of God yeah don't let another
[1:26:01] day go by
[1:26:03] why would you rather stay in Egypt to be
[1:26:05] a slave in Egypt
[1:26:08] when there is so much more God has
[1:26:11] provided foreign
[1:27:00] where you have to have everything in
[1:27:02] order
[1:27:04] you can't leave the country anymore
[1:27:08] without having everything in order
[1:27:12] you gotta have things in order
[1:27:14] going in a Rapture is
[1:27:17] superior to that
[1:27:19] you are not going in a Rapture without
[1:27:23] having everything
[1:27:25] whatever you lack now
[1:27:27] get in order now
[1:27:30] if you need to be baptized in the name
[1:27:32] of the Lord
[1:27:34] there ain't no better way better day
[1:27:37] than today
[1:27:39] if you need to come to the altar to
[1:27:42] repentance
[1:27:44] there ain't no better day than today
[1:27:50] God if you need the Holy Ghost
[1:27:54] there ain't no better day than today
[1:27:58] if you need another experience or a
[1:28:01] greater experience
[1:28:04] there ain't no better day than today
[1:28:09] you can't leave in the Rapture the day
[1:28:12] after
[1:28:15] when the Rapture
[1:28:18] is happening
[1:28:31] always
[1:28:41] he will always fulfills and he will
[1:28:45] always set things in motion
[1:28:47] and for his word to be compliant
[1:28:50] completa
[1:28:53] as we pray
[1:28:55] whatever now my brothers and sisters
[1:29:06] you have a very capable Pastor here
[1:29:10] the brothers that are visiting there's
[1:29:12] God has provided still what you have
[1:29:14] need of don't never underestimate it
[1:29:18] God provides all that we have
[1:29:23] but you that are members of The church
[1:29:25] here
[1:29:28] you have God's man here
[1:29:32] and just as as I would say in my home
