God put a law down here in Harvest and thine field and has forgot a sheath in the field that shall not go again to fetch it it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the Widow that the Lord thy God May bless thee and all thy Work of thy hands food so then Ruth she had to it's she had to gleam and she had to go pick up what was what was left a little things that are falling that's what she was allowed to do spiritual bring it to the spiritual side do you say oh on Friday brother it was his turn to preach well he doesn't bring so much but let me tell you there's a true Ruth there sitting amen she's gonna she's gonna grab every grain of the word of God it doesn't matter if the preacher is bad root was a laborer from night to day or day to night sorry bro amen rude rudos Ruth chapter two verse came from Bethlehem to the Reapers they answered him the Lord hears them yes and the servant who was set over the Reaper's answer and said is the mobile dandel who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab discans and she said I pray you let me glean and gather after the Reapers among the sheaves so she came and has continued even from the morning until now except she carried a little in the house is then boy said unto Ruth here is thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens now when you find the word of God you find the message of the hours you don't have to look for it in any other place you don't have to look for it in the world of God then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have I found Grace in thine eyes that thou should take notice of me seeing I am a stranger is answering Center it have fully been shown to me all that thou has done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thine husband and how thou has left thy father and thy mother and thy land of thine activity and has come unto a people whom thou knew is not heretofore from the Lord God of Israel under whose wings he has come to trust then she said let me find favor in that side Marlo for thou has comforted me and thou has spoken friendly unto thine handmade though I am not like one unto one of thine handmaids root didn't deserve that Grace Just Like Us represents the Lord Jesus Christ there were for the Gentiles it comes with a great message yeah this is and sometimes we say around there oh he's mad if the pastors matter or not and when she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young man saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach your knot and and he led for also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not sometimes a pastor comes with a great message a majority of the times and those are they're those little sheaves the little grains of the word by the order of God he's telling the the reaper every [Music] or she would give to her to her mother-in-law as well what are we doing with the word those handfuls that the Lord allows to fall Ruth 3-1 the Naomi her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest really that it may be well with thee is and now is not Boaz of our Kindred with whose maidens thou worst be holy winner with barley tonight at the threshing floor it is Raymond upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking that thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do yeah and she said unto her all that thou says unto me I will do this and she went down onto the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law paid hero is had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay herself down we see The Obedience of Ruth here many other gifts that she had but in verse seven this is and he went down to LA to lie down to sleep in La Biblia in the Bible significa morir it means to die yes is Jesus Christ where did he go sleep Ario a Calvary Jesus Christ Jesus slept that cow yeah and where did Ruth go she went to Calvary because she couldn't receive a reward sir it's hard the Labor's hard a sacrifice is the same size as a reward is necessary what a great rewards a great sacrifice now to close [Music] I want to read Redeemer Redemption uh priest in 1955 Jesus Christ on Calvary was your kinsman redeemer that redeemed you from Every curse of the devil he redeems your soul he redeems your weary dreary Spirit he brought you happiness that's what a Redemption brought you peace he brought you Divine Healing three stages of Grace there is the work of the seven churches you can see Calvary there is you can see the statue of a perfect man there is such an incredible book that God for some reason left it there uh foreign [Music] from verse one to three I mean you're happy to be here amen The Book of Ruth says like this now Naomi had a relative on her husband's side a man of standing from the clan of elimelech whose name was Boaz says to Naomi let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I found favor foreign [Music] uh [Music] [Music] hear the bride the Pentecost say with the gifts come to church foreign [Music] Nemos read the word of God because a passion to serve Christ to worship him [Applause] that is of his word while she was in Moab but let me tell you as um if the Book of Ruth wasn't foreign let's give glory to God for the Book of Ruth is a story it's a book it's a story of love in the old testamento boss es it had to be someone of of a Kingsman it had to be a Kingsman by blood pressure to be a redeemer he also has to pay whatever the price was and and to be able to do it not just be able to do it because I want to praise God amen amen I don't know if you can put the time okay it's found also in the New Testament The Book of John says that the verb became a servant of God it says here's a great place in Israel someone who can redeem a lost estate that's right the only way it could be flesh [Music] by his grace foreign amen that men they wanted to become Kings and the Kings wanted to become God wanted to be a man in our life his glory for his glory excuse me God paid the price you paid the price everything that was due he said his blood for you and die sometimes we just need to have an encounter with Our Redeemer and it's time to know who we are yeah amen Elizabeth sent me a preaching dangerous um dangerous and the preacher said when one knows who you are when you know who you are you become a danger to the devil you become a threat to yourself instead of us to him for the glory of God Amen God bless you foreign [Applause] someone that is punished but I like the way our Pastor said last time something has been lost returns it or restores it is but because that thing is it's already theirs yeah animals have yours we were already Gods you hear the price every one of us say amen amen what a beautiful story they already said yes this night I like to focus on one of the points our brother mentions in the message Kinsmen Redeemer El Capitol was decided in chapter two he says chapter 3 he says Ruth descans resting Ruth chapter four amen our brothers foreign sometimes you do things that for other people they say that's too much that's enough but for the love of God that he had towards us he gave us the best he gives us the best we have the best and being the Ruth appreciating everything we have yes because we know that we don't deserve anything we have we don't deserve the life for many times we get used to having it if they take your phone for a day you'll find out how valuable it is appreciate it when you have it yeah she shows it every time amen amen God bless his word condo images the first time he sees Ruth how perfect God's timing was because he had to place that time has been a type of price he saw something not a wife listen to anything for herself I it wasn't in the future to be seen by the rest she went because there was an elderly woman they showed her a life compared to her own life yeah she said I want something that she said Naomi from Bethlehem Romero album welcome to this message and that's why I speak for myself that we have men and women that love us and call us daughter and want the best for us to offer the best why not be thankful for that thankful that they push us forward to do things yeah maybe look old-fashioned everything that Naomi was talking about teaching her her Traditions things old-fashioned things we could call them something true and that's why we're all here or why are you here this night just because you want to come just to come in English there's many having Church there's many worshiping God but there's only one truth and there's only something that should be true and what is true amen amen this message says although it's not written in the letter you say okay I know what she actually means and thanks to God that we have what our Prophet brought us so look beyond what the story of Ruth really means went there in the first program first one how has Boaz come riding out there in that Carriage looking around over the fields say and his eyes fell on Ruth he was a mess and she found Grace in his Society the eyes of Our Lord foreign [Music] but how do we treat the best [Applause] looking for individuals that's what he wants he wants to give to us why not take it why not appreciate it amen ities it was love at first sight if we can take something implemented is to Simply Be Thankful for can see because actually and actually it was only for Naomi yes typifies the Jews the message our Lord Jesus Christ was for the Jews for us the Gentiles we didn't deserve an opportunity so come and ask for forgiveness deserve the opportunity to come and worship God it was actually for the Jews that's what Ruth showed Boaz what the people saw in roof okay boss because Boaz is going to look foreign and that's the reason Boaz was ready to pay that price remember when Naomi and Ruth arrived to bethlehempo is they arrived in a time of scarcity maybe the people wouldn't give anything for them maybe the people were criticizing how many times have they judged us maybe speaking about us not only do they speak well about Ruth against Ruth telling Boaz don't do it but gay why hurt my question for you tonight is why did it please to redeem us there are better people out there are consecrated more dedicated [Music] but that didn't matter to him the great buildings didn't matter to him if you could sing well or not let's implement the the middle he simply saw you memito saw me and saw something that was worth redeeming [Music] maybe you don't see it you'll never see it in my life [Music] he made that decision for every one of us and he didn't think twice [Music] [Music] [Music] because no one else could love me the way he does there was another Kinsman to Naomi brothers and brother Brown says that was the devil for us [Music] [Music] he didn't love us forgive me and it's by God's love yes it's by his grace that we are redeemed we have this opportunity tonight simply and spirit to bring glass to roster you may bow your heads beloved Heavenly Father [Music] yes
