[0:06] letting go of every single dream away
[0:12] each one down to your feet every moment
[0:18] of my wandering never changes what you
[0:25] see hi everyone we're a growing church
[0:35] located in the city of Fort Collins
[0:36] Colorado our church family along with
[0:39] the pastor boost of true Tabernacle
[0:41] planted at the church here five years
[0:43] ago and has been leasing a building
[0:45] which has been a place of comfort and
[0:47] spiritual healing for many of us the
[0:50] past two years we've been trying to
[0:52] raise some funds by selling food and
[0:54] doing jars cells and car watching
[0:55] Saturdays thinking that in the near
[0:57] future we wanted to buy or built a
[1:00] church to call our own well last week
[1:03] talking to the awesome owner of the
[1:05] building he told us that he was thinking
[1:07] of selling the building this can be a
[1:10] good thing for us or not really good
[1:12] thing let me start with the good thing
[1:14] if we think positive we can buy the
[1:17] whole building and finally we can have a
[1:19] church of our own but we don't have
[1:22] enough money to give the downpayment
[1:24] right now however we will love your help
[1:28] to help us reach our gold the bad thing
[1:30] it's that if we don't obtain the money
[1:32] that the owner is asking for we may have
[1:35] to look for a different place to rent
[1:37] where the rank will be it's twice as
[1:39] much for a smaller place and some of our
[1:41] savings could be gone because we will
[1:44] have to invest in jets another rental
[1:46] place even if we don't end up buying
[1:48] this building we want to buy another one
[1:51] so we need all the help we can get
[1:54] we really need your help to reach our
[1:56] gold any donation that you're willing to
[1:59] give can be deducted out from your taxes
[2:01] because we're a nonprofit organization
[2:04] please do not with our cost we need you
[2:07] at this moment
[2:08] thank you beforehand and god bless you
[2:11] richly
[2:17] [Music]
