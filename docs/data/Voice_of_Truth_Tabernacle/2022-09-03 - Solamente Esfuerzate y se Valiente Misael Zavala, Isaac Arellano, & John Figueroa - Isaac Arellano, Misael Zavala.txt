the ones watching in the internet our sister vicky in california and the ones that are in california our brothers and everyone else who couldn't be here tonight and for the ones that will be watching after as well where the lord says let the lord the god of the spirits of all the flesh set a man over the congregation which may go out before them and which may go in before them and which may lead them out and which may bring them in that the congregation of the lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd says and the lord said unto moses take thee joshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thine hand upon him and set him before eli azar the priests and before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sight and thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him that all the congregation of the children of israel may be obedient and he shall stand before eleazar the priest who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of arim before the lord at his word shall they go out and at his word they shall come in both he and all the children of israel with him even all the congregation and moses did as the lord commanded him and he took joshua and set him before eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge as the lord commanded by the hand of moses may bow your head brother father celestial heavenly father we're thankful lord the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated this passage of the bible is when god orders moses to go to the mountain of urim so he can see the promised land now that moses would not enter moses is asking god if he can have a successor so israel can come into the promised land having the foreknowledge he had already observed joshua josue not only and so much god plays joshua as moses successor algona some of the characteristics god saw in joshua josue joshua was a helper he could help moses anywhere he offered to help forgive me joshua did not move alone joshua always awaited on moses's orders yes that's right one more thing josue joshua was faithful to moses ministry as a prophet and pastor this was one of the qualities joshua he was faithful to the ministry with what the head of the church says servant significa but what does a minister mean is a servant and a servant as a servant that's what ministers all of them that enforce something out there and the preaching ordinance preached 1962. we believe the holy ghost calls men the holy ghost ordains men no importa last month don't matter how much hands we put on brother mckinney or any other minister hour after hour and give them a long uh list of things to sign swearing to certain creeds it won't benefit [Music] so this is what joshua was for moses a servant joshua was always working in the lord's work and that's what god was watching honesty under moses's orders it was on mount sinai with moses who was in charge of the new tabernacle that is 40 years joshua return but when moses delivers them now they're the church of god god bring him out a nation from did not go into the promised land because he smit the rock there's another reason why he did an answer so if moses was the type of the denominational church what was joshua joshua was the type of the holy ghost the ones joshua was a type of the holy ghost the word joshua in hebrew yes jesus is jesus a type of god calling his church coming out of a church because his bride out of a church but it doesn't stop there josue joshua is also a type the ministerio de los ultimos of the end time ministry or coming into the promised land this chosen joshua's ministry castle in this case syria would it be el ministerio de los ultimos the end-time ministry that has a prophet because joshua was also a prophet it was just a change and joshua becomes moses successor to place the bride in the promised land josue with the bride of the lord jesus christ you have the promise of entering into the promised land god bless you [Applause] god bless you brethren we enter now into the story we've entered where moses is but the purpose of god and now our prophet is dead but our works continue through the bride amen amen how many believers are here in this night i just have to express i have a lot of joy especially i'm happy to see my brother bailey here estoy content no he was the first side i saw when i walked up here and he's one of my best friends amigos and all glory to god amen man but this message was born thinking on the bad report of the 10 spies pensando de los el reported espios so making a personal haciendo personal we move from slavery you can't think of the people of israel that was their journey amen slavery brokenness but a victorious christian living victoria and blessings even this younes as soon as we stop watching an area the devil is already there so we need a v being constant vigilance um caleb and joshua josue no i don't want to get too deep but so if you i can think of these other 10 spies with negative negativity amen amen because they were not watching they're not watching the promises of god they were watching the same thing so many christians christians failed to leave the place of slavery and to answer in a place of victory these 10 spies espionage they failed to enter in a place of victory you know there are people that are offended that the occupation of the land of canaan amen amen so bring that to our time the moment that you give that i give my life to christ the moment you decide you're going to be a christian the moment you invite the holy spirit to come in your life and the journey of the christian life cristiano where things are inside your head you can but what's interesting about the passage of joshua is that god has given them the land the issue the problem is not no is if god would give it to them the issue it's not if god is is not if god is going to give you the holy ghost the issue el problema is if they're going to occupy the land of canaan the issue the problem is if you're going to occupy the position in the holy spirit of a in the ten spies that we're saying we should have died back there amen amen we wanna remain bound [Music] but joshua's going to show us a different life and you know what the book of or starting this book of joshua josue god's speaking to me i take these words personally and there's never been a greater time never else in history there's never been a greater time in your life for you to do exactly there's never been another greater time joshua 1 5 says josue there shall not any man be able to stand before the other days of thy life as i was with moses so will i be with thee i will not filthy nor forsake thee here god is promising a lifetime una vida and terrain [Applause] for the rest of thy days i will not fail thee if you can take something tonight god will never fail you brother can put let your conversation be without coverage covetousness and be content with such things as you have again the same thing lo mismo i will never leave thee nor forsake thee another confirmation for this present time that we will not fear que nobo like david said the lord is my comfort mediocre amen amen joshua 1-6 josue uno says and i'm going to be closing what i want to focus on here it says be strong and of good courage for unto this people shall not divide for an inheritance to the land which i swear unto the fathers to give tierra de la hoya command courage and strength from joshua josue anybody ask yourselves he has promised joshua josue and in that sense he becomes a type of jesus jesus just like joshua's dividing the land jesus is dividing the gift now are the occupants of the land gonna go quietly the ones that occupy your mind are they going to leave quietly the ones that occupy your flesh we gotta admit brother tenemos there's other spirits occupying us is that he's going to be part of in the future there are hard-fought battles there's battles that you will be part of in the future amen amen so it's going to take strength and courage for you to walk the walk god has called you to wake up it's going to take strength and courage to pray for your brother the courage we're talking about amen amen the courage that i'm reading here la valentina questo is god's permission is la el permiso de dios to go forward in spite of the obstacles amen the courage we're talking about is a divine nerve eso i get excited just saying that courage the courage la valencia is a divine is fueled by acting under the lord's instruction is gasolina so i'm not talking no story of lando the word of god is not talking you all know this yaki about having strength and courage and go do your own business to go and occupy the land we're talking about having courage what god has called us to do so fulfill us think of the same courage that david had espionage that he said my desire and the fathers are one misdemeanors desiring what the lord wants and if you can take something tonight is that courage is it valentia god has given you permission god bless you [Applause] all lord of god god bless you ma'am we went travajo your bibles are in joshua turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whether so ever thou go is josue to speak on chance although it is a youth service we the adults but the story and the adults and the bible teaches us from a young age is is because he is and courageous is i seven after giving it joshua you will answer and divide it i go before you not [Applause] [Music] imagine how joshua [Applause] [Music] oh a tough they're great [Music] is uh foreign [Music] the son of jefferna which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake and swallow the company of the church the language [Applause] was full of the spirit of wisdom and moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of israel hearken unto him and did as the lord commanded moses he was full of the spirit to trust and do according to the words the life of this man is extraordinary man as you and i know these nations their way of torturing people was without was greater than them but he held on to the word [Music] of god work of god and they do strikes but if we set ourselves up on god's word we begin oh and we don't word of god choosing is very difficult but i hope you received the the
