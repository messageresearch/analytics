in First Peter chapter 5 verse 7 I'll be switching to English casting all your care upon him for he carth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking who he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world if you could please bow your heads do a quick prayer Heavenly Father we give you thanks Father for giving us the opportunity to be here in your house I would like to thank you Lord for all that you do in our lives Lord I ask you Lord that you may anoint my lips and that no foolish word may come out of them I also ask that you help my brothers those in the audience and those who are going be preaching beside me Lord ask you this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen amen I would like to thank uh God and my pastor Tito for the opportunity to be here and for his trust tonight as a youth service oh you may be seated we're going to be speaking on Daniel tonight as they preached a few weeks ago they they preached a few weeks ago that Daniel did not defile himself with the things of the king's [Music] doing and it was preached to us that that because of that that Daniel was blessed and I want to take that thought and bring it to chapter two now and we're going to be reading Daniel chapter 2 verse 1-3 and in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed the dreams wherewith his Spirit was troubled and his sleep break from him then the king commanded to call The Magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers and the C alans for to show the king his dreams and they came and stood before the king and the King said unto them I have dreamed a dream and my spirit was troubled to know the dream so the King Nebuchadnezzar he had this dream and when he he was troubled by this dream so he called his calans and his Sorcerers and his wise men but by the time they got there he already forgot the dream so he told his Sorcerers and his wise men tell me the dream and the interpretation of it and these C and these wise men they did not know the dream they told him that no man could do it and because of this his King was very Furious and he made a decree to kill all the wise men of the land and Daniel was included in there and and this King is kind of like enemy our enemy because he wants to kill us the devil's always going to try to find something to to destroy us especially his children especially those that do not defile themselves with the world those that do Godly things I'm going be reading Daniel chapter 2 17- 19 then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to hananiah mishel and and Azariah his companions that they would desire mercies of the god of Heaven concerning the secret that Daniel and his followers would not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon Bon then was the secret raled unto Daniel in a night vision then Daniel blessed the god of heaven so the king had ordered his men to go kill the wise men of Babylon Daniel and his companions included so what Daniel did is something that a lot of us don't do he went to his house and asked his friends to pray with him so that God may have mercy upon them he was going to God with his problems so he may get any Mercy from him and that's something we don't do a lot of times we like to solve everything on our own we think we're enough we think we're enough we think we don't need God's help and we think we don't need anybody else's help but the Bible says in James 5:116 that we should pray one for the other we should be asking for prayer we should be asking for because that's what's going to help us in the end because God knows all things he wants the best for us now Daniel went to his friends and asked for prayer right and the vision came to him and this Vision was the King's dream and then Daniel gave worship and worship to God that's also a lot of things we don't do God has done so many things for us and we can't even say thank you we can't even thank him for whatever he's done just breathing is his Mercy and he blessed the god of heaven and later on Daniel showed the king the dream and the interpretation of it and we'll be reading Daniel 246 then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped Daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him the king answered unto Daniel and said of a truth it is that your God is a god of gods and Lord of kings and revealer of Secrets seest thou couldest couldest revealed this Secret then the king made Daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon and chief of the governors over the wise men of Babylon and so when Daniel went to God [Music] God gave him the answer to his problems and this solution solved that problem but it didn't only solve the problem God blessed him as well Daniel asked for a solution to his problem and God gave him more and I would like to read the handwriting on the wall 56 notice in there God has a servant down there by the name of Daniel a young Prophet about 40 years old who was serving the Lord with all his heart and God had a work for him to do notice in there God had a servant down there by the name Daniel a young Prophet about 40 years old who was serving the Lord with all his hearts and God had a work for him to do and in the carrying away of Babylon remember if God has a work for you to do all the demons out of Torment can't take you they just can't store to you in any way God's got a purpose for the Holy Ghost Church and all the Devils of Hell will never be able to take it any away God's got a purpose for it and will never be destroyed until God lets the Fulfillment of that purpose and he has ordained it to do and it will and remember as Daniel went to the Hebrew children down in there I want you to notice many of them already Wordly minded many of them didn't care well they just go to the tide of the least resistance and isn't that just about a picture of our country today so if God has given you a purpose the devil can't do anything to hinder you because God ordained that purpose he can set Temptation he can send temptation but God's got a way out because he won't give you more Temptation than you will you can [Music] and it keeps on saying oh God give us more men like Daniel give us Christians like Shadrach mesach and Abednego or willing to sacrifice or forfeit every right that they have to become a servant of the lord we have to sacrifice ourselves youth we have to stand up for the word of God look at the Times we're living in right now we can't sit around on the benches doing nothing anymore the end times are here the end times are here Babylon was a time like our time full of sin keeps on saying Daniel and alien away from home way down but watch what he did he purposed in his heart that he wouldn't defile himself with the king's doings down there all the king's fancy foods and all the dainties and that he was eat upon his wine Liquors and that he purposed in his heart while he was an alien he keep himself for God Amen amen now listen youth listen to what I'm about to say there you are though the world forsake you yeah everybody laughs at you calls you every fanatical name that could be called purpose in your heart to do which is right purpose in your heart that you'll do nothing to do with the world living the Shadows of the coming of the lord we can't sit still anymore youth we can't run away from God anymore we're the Next Generation up and coming if God doesn't come before our ministers are getting old then it's our turn I know that scares you because that scares me but don't worry because we are predestinated for this time we were built for this age it's time to stand up to the devil we can't run away from God anymore we have to go to him May full of sin and trouble but he's going to help us out he has the solution he is the solution we reading and the and thy seed shall possess the Gate of his enemy PR 62 the Hebrew children after they had stood the test whether they would stay for the The Word of Promise or not they were put to a trial and what do they do they possessed the Gate of the enemy amen why they sit on the word stay with the word that voice of God that speaks to you youth we have to keep with the word I know it's hard to read the word sometimes I'll admit I don't really do it that often but when I do it's the times where I find out what I need to do and sometimes we may feel alone because we don't do like the rest of the world does because we don't defy ourselves with them but that's all right like Brother D like brother brandom said Daniel was an alien down there with all the other people in Babylon but that didn't stop him he purposed in his heart to not defile himself and we should do the same we shouldn't be out there prostituting ourselves to we should be here worshiping him because that's our purpose to serve it with all our heart I'll be closing with this uh Expectations by Brother Bron PR 51 Daniel when they told him they was going to throw him in the Lion's Den he was expecting God to be there he believed that he lived right before God and he had a right and every day he raised the shades if there was any way in them days towards the temple and looked towards the Holy Temple and prayed because he believed that there was a burning sacrifice at the altar that the hour at the that hour at the temple and he believed that God heard his prayer because there was no was an innocent substitute died in his place making an anoint atonement and when God went went into the lion's den and when he went into the D L Li Den he did not fear the Lions because he was expecting God to deliver him amen amen let's run to God brothers because he's going to be the one who delivers us and remember youth we're not alone he's always going to be by our side even though we're down in sin he's the one who Rises us up God bless you God bless you it's wonderful to see how God never leaves us and this night we've tled are preaching You Are Not Alone how many believe you're not alone he is in our midst he's always with us amen imagine everything Daniel went through and taking care of himself and that's only with the blood of the sacrifices and now that we have the blood of the perfect sacrifice how much much more can it do for us even more you can open your Bibles in Daniel chapter 3 we'll be reading Daniel chapter 3 verse 1-7 while you look for I want to give thanks our Titus for giving me the opportunity to speak here and it says Daniel 3 ver onear the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits he set it up in the pl of dura in the province of Babylon then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image of Nebuchadnezzar the the king had set up then and Herald cried aloud to you it is commanded all people Nations and languages that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornate flute harp sacka Suter dolmer and all kinds of music ye Fall Down and Worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up and who so fth not down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the Cornet flute harp sacka Sultry and all kinds of music all the people all the nations and the languages fell down and worshiped the golden image Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and this evening I'd like to share the experience these three Hebrew men had in the fury fness for standing up for God's word they had already made a decision to stand for God's word not mattering the circumstance what they were going through not mattering anything their decision was to accept God it didn't matter if God answered at the hour when they would put them in the fiery furnace in chapter one of Daniel uh the king is is uh bothered or troubled by his dream and in chapter two his dream is revealed by Daniel and in chapter three the dream is manifested we can say brother Brom says the statue image of [Music] Daniel because in chapter two he was the only one that could reveal that dream they made it they made him a god they changed his name to Bazar amen because they thought him a God because the king's people could not reveal it now I'd like to play out this story of the Three Hebrew [Music] children I imagine them three there that did not want to kneel to this statue they said we cannot bow because God God is the only one that we can worship and they would not bow to any other God so they were willing in their heart not to do that they decided to fight you will always have a battle before having the Victory and when they decided the consequence brought them to not accept and kneeling the consequence was to go to the fiery furnace amen the decree was to toss them in the furnace for not bowing down before this statue but God never leaves you alone God was watching them they thought Shadrach and ab AG go that or the night before were in a prayer service says brother Brandon praying for that coming trial amen and they had to prove that God hasn't changed that God continued there with them not mattering the situation they decided not to to not surrender decided to fight that battle amen so it says they were cast into the fiery furnace I imagine when they were going to throw them in there they he it up the oven the furnace seven times hotter than it is even the ones that threw them in the in the furnace says that they died with the the vapor or the heat waves I can imagine kingar sitting next to the watching them when they would perish watching if their God would deliver them but God was also working there because God never leaves his children when something is happening on Earth something is happening in heaven when they were walking towards the fire furnace God was in heaven SE seated watching them he was in his throne with his angels when Gabriel got close and said oh Lord have you considered thy servants thy children they are there standing for your word they have trusted in you let me go and change the scene annihilate everyone and he said Gabriel since I formed you you have been faithful and obeyed me you have done everything I've asked but I cannot let you go he didn't let him go a HHO showed up a hanho was there and he said Lord when Noah was on the earth you gave me permission to flood the Earth give me permission to flood Babylon and save your children and if there is a God but he said but he said I can't let you go then he said why Lord because they're my children I need to go myself amen he will never leave us alone he needs to be there we can say like Joshua said I will not leave you be be strong and courageous if God would tell me that word I wouldn't be afraid to continue but he has given a promise that he will be with us amen so he's given that promise to us as well to trust in him so when they were about at the last step they went to the furnace but one waiting for them there and they never burned or they didn't even smell like smoke because God was in their midst God will never leave you alone in the middle of the trial he will be there if you are fighting be joyful because God is with you if you're fighting because God hasn't left you theil to convince you but God hasn't left you God is with you doesn't matter what you need if you decided to follow Christ God is willing to give you everything doesn't matter what it is God will be with you just like the Hebrew children amen the situation W matter they said brother Brom says that they said no not carrying that's the decision we must to tell the world no put a stop and no it's that decision but it's not the decision that we say yes we say yes here in church and when we leave we're thinking something different if we make a decision you need to support that because God God will support his word amen he said that he be with us till the end of the world Amen not mattering he will be with you as he was with the Hebrew children God was with them King Nebuchadnezzar was there and went to see because now he saw there was four and he asked did you not put three three they said we did so he was amaz and said there's another one and he looked like the Son of God he said God will never leave you alone God was there with them amen because God supports his word they had stood for God and God will stand for if you stand for God God will stand for you amen he will be with you amen amen that's everything brother God bless you brother Marshall God bless you brother let's open our Bibles to John John 14 chapter one or verse one John Chapter 14 verse one it reads let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me and in Jeremiah 2 verse [Music] reads and I will give them in heart to know me that I am the Lord and they shall be my people and I will be their God for they shall return unto me with their whole heart may God help us this evening for title we' titled You are not alone and I believe with all my heart that we are not alone although things things seem difficult in our lives God allows them with a purpose if there's one thing that I know that God has never left me and if God hasn't left this I believe with all my heart has never left you also I don't know brother but I Rejoice I rejoice in my tribulations and in [Music] problems because that's when God gives me the most that's when God gives that's when he proves himself more to my life and he reminds me and he tells me son you are not alone I haven't left you you can maybe do anything on this Earth can leave to the world if you want you can wear whatever you want you can act however you want but God will always be with you God has never left you will never leave you sons of God I just remind you that you're not alone Amen brother now we're speaking on Daniel this scripture I read in Jeremiah I'm going to read this quote from Brother brandham a man running from the presence of God God preached 1965 we find out father that what we need is to understand because if we don't know what we're doing then how do we know how to do it but we should have understanding as Daniel said that had understanding by the writings of the Prophet Jeremiah and father we have understanding by the writings of the holy spirit that he reveals to us in this hour give us Lord the desires we have for you brother Bram is saying [Music] herei that Daniel understood the scriptures from Jeremiah he understood what was going to happen for him to be in was not a coincidence he knew that would happen children of God go will be you should know one is with you God will never leave you doesn't matter if you don't feel it or if you do God is with you God promised to be with you now I don't stand up here to just give you a show I stand here as a testimony that through tribulations that's when God reveals in my life through what you're going through God promised to reveal to you come on children of God because the scripture we read the Lord Jesus Christ speaking says let your hearts not be trouble what does that [Music] mean that when the problems and tribulations our hearts are troubled our [Music] hearts goes through a phase of fear of insecurity and everyone goes through that any bad news that we listen and more if it's a beloved we're going to be a little uneasy a little our hearts will be troubled yes Brethren if someone walked in through these doors screaming that someone isn't feeling well back there or that they fainted or or died our hearts are going to be troubled by the news yes Brethren because every human goes through that Les brother if we do stay still as the scripture says be still that I am God see God in the scene if we St still with his word we can see we would see God's wonders in our lives amen amen but what happens the devil has a subtle way of getting in our mind to our heart and trouble you by using insecurity but if we would understand that we will go through trials no longer is in you will knowed on this Ser but also also you will know now which God you're serving these three Hebrew men they knew where they were going it wasn't something new where they're taking were they going to do they knew they were preparing and they would put them in there up seven but they were not afraid of that because they knew their trust was in God Son of God God's presence there's nothing on this plan that can move you why because you come in into the presence of the Holy Spirit problem will show in your life come on youth what God hasn't shown God brought you out of Youth has God not given you a purpose has not filled you of his filled you of his holy ghost human can receive his holy spirit what I need on this Earth be filled by the Holy Spirit oh but I'm a sinner oh I'll be filled with the Holy Spirit if you failed a couple hours ago how can I receive the Holy Ghost well look Brethren the scripture tells us and reminds us that we would return with the whole heart to God and we would worship him with all of our hearts what we need in this hour to give our heart surrender sincere heart to God and then you will glory of God in your lives this Earth in this time and in this hour what happens many times is the devil gets in our mind it reminds us how filthy we are how sinful we are and that's why we doubt bless us in this evening don't think you're the only one strug very much to come up here a lot because I don't feel worthy I'm a sinner I sin every day if I'm sincere I fa every second that's why I understand this is a youth service are there youth here in this evening did the youth come did we come to receive something from God look youth it doesn't matter who stands here if you don't come with an receive from God you will leave worse from these doors so I want to tell you is that God God is already in you all that's left for is for you to bring him out bring him out ohen like brother Caleb said you are God's face you are God's face I am God's face amen Amen brother why is it hard to believe that I've purposed myself to finish on time because I've understood and understanding the importance about time and I'll express it public I I'm expecting God I'm Wai I'm hoping in God that I don't go over my time from now on let's see if we can do it past but look we should have understanding look one of the things that I found out why I struggle is because I don't understand where I get in I just make decisions lightly and when I'm in in it I look at reality and I'm suffering so understand youth understand where you're getting into where you are look I heard a brother that congregated with brother I I like he said brother ber I want to congregate with you you accept me I want you to be my pastor brother Bernie told you know how many millions or thousands of demons want to kill me he said yes so then you are willing and he said yes I am willing he was willing with understanding understanding where he was getting into that's how Daniel was that's how the three Hebrew men were that's how every Son of God is that's how every Son of God is amen amen the problems tribulations come time to kneel and say bring God down to say Lord if you don't help me if you don't help me find a p bones oh God cannot leave you in that condition he promised to for any of his children does matter what you were going through he promised to come down yes Brethren ohren just imagine these Hebrew young men I have two minutes left look I look for the meaning a little if the musicians can come shadra Shadrach an his name was ananiah the meaning of shadra is the one that is merciful That Forgives watch the meaning of meac whom like god wow aarah AB Abednego y has helped so there we see brother how merciful god is that he forgive us from any that we've made on this Earth all that we have to do is come to him and you will see God's hand in your life whom like God who like my God can do what my God can do and accept a sinner It's Only Our God it's my God that ACS me just how I am Jehovah has helped me the Lord has helped us this far the Lord has helped us this far oh Brothers I tell you are not alone you are not alone out with all of your hearts I assure you that God will because God where his children are

Christians and he was not scared to worship God he did not have any fear he was so brave that he would open the the W the the curse to his even though he knew that they were they may they maybe could kill him but he did not have fear to the people but he feared God he knew what type of God he was serving come on [Music] church God has given us this place to worship Him amen amen that's sometimes I

[Music] place we need brave people like Daniel do not be scared you were born to worship God created you to worship Him Do not be scared to stand up for God young man young people see yes we should not be scared who who cares if everyone else is listening to the music of the world I have I don't have any complex that I don't know I don't know the the artist the world they can they could talk to me about the the the the the artist of the world and I don't have no idea who they're talking to be different even here at church let's be different if we see all the other Christians or or children of Christians and we see them halfway in the in the world and halfway in the things of God and we want to feel a little bit weird sometimes do not feel weird this is a place for Christians and the children of God we need people to stand up for the word like sadrach I don't know that when everyone else bows down they remain stand they were the we the weird ones but what what how proud they were who cares of everyone else who cares if everyone else wants to dress I came to stand for my God I am going to be different amen don't don't feel don't follow everyone else's don't follow the influence of your friends don't follow the influence of your friends here at church someone does something be different be [Music] different be the influence to someone that wants to follow [Music] God look for be an influence for that Soul that's looking for a witness what we [Music] need and I say it here at church I'm not saying I'm not they don't know we know we need people to stand up for the [Music] truth come on you people not be scared to be [Music] different I believe I I I love D he stood up and Danel open so they can see him not because he wanted to be seen simply because he was not SC because that's what he did that was his he did not have to hide from anyone we want to hide that we're [Music] Christian we need men that seek the correct what's correct that they want the correct I want when there when there's young people I I believe when there's youth when there is youth men when they're seeking a young girl not someone that looks like the world but they're looking for a lady I believe that that the ladies are going to fix themselves that they realize that they realize what the that they're looking for daughters of God a man should be so clear a young man I don't want someone that looks like the artist of the world young men stand up for God and stand up for what's [Music] correct you cannot force anyone but you can be an influence for someone else if you say I am seeking and I believe there's going to be that they're going to want to be Daughters of God but if you you look at anything the the women are not going to have a desire to be a a young lady uh a lady a lady a lady a daughter of [Music] God I believe it begins with the men amen I am challenging the men here look for ladies with someone that's Halfway Christian that's going to motivate you that's going to motivate them that's going to motivate them to say to say Lord I want to be a lady but while there there's still men that want like like the rest of the world there's going to be Queens of sex here at church forgive me Brothers [Music] I believe we should all go up higher God has given us a bigger responsibility here in for we should go up even higher our expectation should be higher our worshiping should be more we should be an example fors we should be an example for Fort Collins we should be an example for the message of the hour God has not given this to every one of the message of the hour but God has given it to us we should be an example for other [Music] churches I I'm challenging the the youth not to be scared and I am starting starting with the young men do not be scared do not be scared to stand for your God do not be scared to ask for what's [Music] right the statue it was the Statue of Daniel brother brandham says even even though is there's is a statue of a child of God even though if it's a statue of your best friend even if it's a statue that someone that helped you do not uh to break the word of God even though if it's someone that just comes to church we listen to this music you don't you know say this is even though you're wrong that is even though if they say whatever it is that is wrong even though they're your friend even though there's somebody here at church it's still wrong if you if you think I'm scaling you I am scaling you I am your pastor that's why God put me here we thank God for for young strong men like like like Daniel and shadra and shamro and thank you God for young men like them that they did not were they were not scared to stand up for their God may God give that to us that brave that that courage to stand for our I'm not scared to worship Him don't be scared to worship Him don't be scared to say glory to God don't be scared to say I am a child of God we failed yes we failed but we are we are fighting there

everything for our God they have been such brave men like them there has been such brave men like them that they have worshiped God in in the middle in the middle of a death threat and we are here
