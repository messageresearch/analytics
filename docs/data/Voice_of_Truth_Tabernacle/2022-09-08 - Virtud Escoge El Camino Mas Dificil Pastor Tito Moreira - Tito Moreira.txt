to the Book of Revelations we welcome all those that were out of town and it's good to see you once again some God come back a little sick they said that we staying home a fuse actually told me they weren't feeling well so let's be praying for them we thank God for everything the little otter on my face it's not because I'm depressed I'm actually very happy and it's not to look better but I I don't feel like I look better on a look in the mirror and I'm like but I'm about to go into the promise and I want to go like a spy yeah a little bit uh just uh looking a little different disguised if you don't like it just uh just bear with me um a I Know Thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou are rich and I know the blasphemy of them would say are they are Jews and are not but are the synagogue of satanos is if you're none of those things without shall suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that he may be tried and ye shall have tribulation 10 days be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a Crown of Life let us pray foreign in the Book of Revelation which is the Smyrna Church age we're speaking in a time of Christianity where there was a Great Tribulation great suffering persecution great persecution they say that uh one other there was when there was that the 19 Council that happened in the next stage the majority of the Christian Church went through a Great Tribulation Paso program persecution through great persecution they killed them and El Tiempo masstoria Cristiana in the bloodiest time of Christianity were being it was one of the most dangerous things throughout the world's history God is speaking to them in these verses God is sending the message to them is our faithful unto death now be thou faithful unto death I get my title out of the Dead those words because brother Branham says it like this he says this reminds me of the marriage vows you'll be faithful until death do you part it's a election or choosing and we'll be speaking with the title virtue chooses the harder way chooses the harder way Dios [Applause] Dios uh now God is is a God he is the Bible says that God's wisdom is very different than man's Wisdom and the wisdom of God not only does it allow suffering tribulation and persecution but it's part of God's plan is part of God's design that his children would be tried there's no other way there's no other there's no escaping from it it's not an easy way out for the child of God it does not exist the one that is foreign no [Applause] [Applause] muchacher foreign Lord will have great Treasures that don't want to suffer will God have great choice this is so fundamental crucial or crucial do you want Treasures in Heaven if you want to be rich in God there's no listen there's no other way produces treasure amen I want you to remember that that's right brother tribulation produces treasure all right now I'm going to continue reading on the Smyrna churches speaks on second Timothy 4. he says without watching all things do the work of an evangelists make full proof of thy Ministries when the church allowed herself to move away from the original like Adam and Eve this is important is when the original was changed now he's speaking on this church then he says there is no strength in her yeah she has become a monstrosity the minute the church moved toward a form and ceremony yes she changed to a powerless people no no this virtue means a strength or power virtue means power virtue means notice what took the strength away notice they were left without strength apparently they were a monstrosity they have great buildings good preachers but they have no virtue they have no power not yet they have they look like they don't have what the Church of God should have Lo Mas Fuerte is the power of the Holy ghosts [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] but I have little of the power of God [Applause] [Applause] and follow me right brother and the hollow La Cruz they have left the cross and acquires and emotions like less the church has left their cross yes sir Los cristianos the Christians have left the cross yes as a Living Sacrifice Flores produce a church without power to us today God is speaking to us foreign why we all have advising and criticisms few people have Solutions a church without power or our character there's no character because we want everything easy that's why we're so poor in character a person with a true character is it's like as Roman 8 35 says who shall separate us from the love of Christ tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter in in all these things and all these things and all these things we are more than conquerors how do you become a conqueror you know these things [Applause] all these things we are more than conquerors hey man Hallelujah for which I am certain I'm persuaded that neither yes nor life nor angels or principalities nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord foreign and so forth like that you're made rich through this those tribulations you're made Rich through there those tribulations foreign it strengthens it is always it strengthens the church always strength is always strengthens the child of God in tribulations but you're rich one time they asked T.S Lewis a great evangelisto suffering why do the righteous suffer they asked them the question he replied why not they're the only ones who can take it Mundo estas although the world is full of suffering that's the great thing it is also foreign of the overcoming of it [Music] yeah yesterday and that's the Glorious thing got a loud suffering in order to see the overcomer there's a famous man perhaps you know perhaps you don't uh is somebody that studies his name is Stephen uh Hawkins Hawking yeah um and it has uh scientific problems very famous and he'll be he'll be known in history for forever Una syndrome he was diagnosed with a syndrome ALS syndrome ALS um it took his life he died not that long ago if I recall um that syndrome [Music] it bound him to a wheelchair for years and think he couldn't even speak and the way that he was able to communicate [Music] was through a machine that they put in his eyes a little bit of movement in his fingers on the tips of his fingers it was too weak to write he was unable to eat by himself he couldn't even comb his hair he couldn't even fix just his glasses somebody had to do those things for him um Hawkins said okay he had little interest in life he called it an existence without purpose pointless existence well pointless existence he spent his time aboard he drank a lot yes he did little work then he realized he had this he found out he had the syndrome and they told him he wouldn't live of more than two years then after the shock he had received to do this his life became very positive to have been happier Affliction after he was afflicted then before they asked him how that could be understood when one's expectations are reduced to zero the sentence he said one really appreciates everything that one does have in other words happiness in life is determined in part by what a person anticipates from it to a man like Hawking Pronto I thought he would die soon quickly significado everything takes on meaning a sunrise or the laughter of children suddenly each small pleasure becomes precious by contrast those who believe alive [Applause] Gente quesmas in Feliz are often discontented even with its finest gifts a man said this is that was unable to to speak even he did more with his life when he was sick then when he was healthy my mind Gloria is I was reading there are almost all the Bible all the songs all of Paul's Epistles we're written through a time of suffering the greatest the best songs were written when David was running with God for his life the greatest cries forsaken [Applause] sometimes with pain in their lives even the Book of Revelation We Know It Was Written inspired when John was found on the Isle of Patmos solo alone when they wanted to kill him why is it that in pain because it is because it's in pain it's in pain when God gets the best out of his children yes [Applause] that's the devil that's the devil speaking Brothers the Holy Spirit to become dormant in US is the devil telling you to just be still there on the beaches with the preachers take it easy Hallelujah but I want to tell you one thing is suffering has very little effect in somebody until that person chooses it themselves there has to come a time where the son or daughter of God is [Applause] not something that somebody else repentance Jesus Christ nobody takes my life I'll lay it down myself because he chose it and that made the whole difference the great thing wasn't that he was crucial the great thing was that he chose to be crucified that's right brother Hebrews 11 24 says by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a seasoning the reproach of Christ greater riches in the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the rewards he chose Moses chose he made the choosing he was told in the message you're standing in the bridge and he shares it on other occasions how this interpreter how this brother had spoken tongues an interpreter interpreted it and this was the message that was spoken the spoken tongues this is what it was related because thou has chosen because you chose it because you made the election because you decided because you made a Consciousness because you had the options you chose this or that but because you have children the harder way thou has walked in your own choosing you're not there for a sin I didn't force you this is God says you're not therefore said I didn't obligate nobody forced you that's what he made you do it that's the greatest battle in this day is that we have the elections perhaps they didn't have the uh foreign [Applause] the Book of James says one of verse two my brethren County versus when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this at the triangle for your faith work is patience but let patience you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing when can you be happy in Tribulation when you choose it can you be joyful in tribulations come and find the riches of God to suffer with God then to enjoy the world where does it become a joy and a privilege to have long hair foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] to the difficult way s had just gone through a great trial he said that he had just lost his job a great Fortune as well and his home and to add to that his wife had just passed away even then he tried to keep stand firm in his faith that was all he had left one day as he was walking outside trying to find employment foreign work we're working on Stones he was shaping a stone for this a great church one of the most chasing a triangular piece of Rock and he asked this man is where are you gonna put that contest the Workman said do you see that little opening up there near the Aspire Bueno yo estoy for Mando esta Piedra well I'm shaping this Stone akbajo down here so the red will fit in up there is this the stone down here so that it would fill up a fit in up there they said the tears filled his friend's eyes God has just spoke with him through the labor I have the right character for [Applause] the reason for why he needs you there in eternity and we seek the easier way the musicians can come forward they said when Williams Sangster Una is musculos it was told he was dying of a progressive muscular atrophy this is made of a decision he made a juicy he resolved within his heart that he Faithfully he was going to do four of these things Faithfully [Music] he said I'll do these four things for the rest of my life I will never complain ment [Music] I'll keep the home bright boys I will count my

[Music] chooses the difficult way [Music] this is [Music] when they uh when they threatened are you eusebius foreign as well [Music] they threatened that they were going to take everything from him and confiscate from them and torture him banish him or even death eusebius said [Music] the one who has nothing to lose he should not be fearful that they would take everything from him [Music] the one who has his home in his home in heaven he has no reason to fear less that they would disappear him [Music] knowing that this body is can be destroyed so easily we have no reason to fear a torment or torture [Music] this body is dissolved very easily anyhow it is a and he says the one that knows that the only way to be set free from the sins and and the Sorrows they know the only way to be delivered the only way to be delivered is to death [Music] he's not scared of death [Music] then he says the writer says when I hear oh yes oh I I hope that my children will go through what I went through he says I don't agree with that difficult it was through those hardships that made us what we are [Music] they would become a disadvantage [Music] if they don't have to suffer as I did your children this generation and we ourselves as the first church we have to give our lives and give it all for him as long as you have it all you'll never be able to produce the Life of Christ [Music] is
