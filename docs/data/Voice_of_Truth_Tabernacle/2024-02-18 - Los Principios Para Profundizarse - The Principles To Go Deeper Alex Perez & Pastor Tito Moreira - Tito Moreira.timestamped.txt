[36:34] place Psalms 92 verse2 when you have you
[36:38] can say
[36:42] Amen thank the Lord for
[36:45] the privil to be
[36:49] here and to be standing behind the
[36:51] pulpit
[36:54] um when you have a say
[36:58] Amen God's word
[37:09] reads the righteous shall flourish like
[37:11] the palm tree he shall grow like Cedar
[37:14] in
[37:24] Lebanon and chapter the next verse
[37:36] 13 those that be planted in the house of
[37:39] the Lord shall flourish in the courts of
[37:41] our
[37:44] God the Lord blessing to his word you
[37:46] may be
[37:48] seated this morning our
[37:53] title we are sharing along with our
[37:55] pastor
[38:00] are principles to be
[38:06] deeper as you know we've been speaking a
[38:08] few weeks a month two
[38:13] months on how to get deeper with
[38:17] God how to go beyond with
[38:25] God I believe the Holy Ghost has led our
[38:28] P to establish this
[38:32] subject because I
[38:35] believe can go deeper with
[38:39] God I believe every one of us including
[38:45] myself we cannot say I've come to the
[38:48] fullness with
[38:51] God come to be so deep with God that I
[38:55] can fly
[38:58] no I believe we can all
[39:04] improve the Christian relationship the
[39:06] relationship between God and
[39:10] us I believe should be deeper every
[39:17] time as you know God's word multiple of
[39:23] times Compares us to trees
[39:39] we could spend minutes talking about
[39:41] God's word how his word Compares us to
[39:43] trees and and other types of plants and
[39:47] palm
[39:52] trees and I believe it's convenient for
[39:55] us if we want to go deeper with
[39:59] God to examine what occurs in a
[40:06] tree in this case I want to focus on a
[40:09] palm
[40:13] tree because I feel there are special
[40:15] qualities about a palm
[40:20] tree and the scripture we just
[40:23] read tells
[40:25] us
[40:27] number
[40:28] one the
[40:32] righteous it's something wonderful to
[40:35] read
[40:37] this because the righteous shall
[40:39] flourish
[40:44] uh a Hebrew version of the
[40:48] Bible
[40:49] flish is to
[40:52] expand is to
[40:54] grow renew yourself
[40:57] is
[41:02] extending that's what flourish
[41:05] means so the
[41:08] righteous shall
[41:10] flourish or
[41:12] expand
[41:15] grow like the palm
[41:19] tree to
[41:24] begin the question comes to my
[41:27] mind who is
[41:30] righteous because seeing my
[41:33] life I'm not
[41:36] righteous I find that my own
[41:40] righteousness and
[41:43] quotations I can't profit of
[41:47] anything the Bible says our best
[41:51] deed like worldly
[41:53] Rags my righteous
[42:01] rag before
[42:03] God I cannot
[42:06] benefit it doesn't help me a
[42:10] lot but when I take his
[42:14] righteousness when I take God's
[42:17] word then I
[42:20] realize that I am full in
[42:25] him
[42:27] give a clap offering to the word of the
[42:29] [Applause]
[42:36] Lord are you gonna forgive
[42:42] me we were sharing some notes with the
[42:50] pastor I feel like my notes got a little
[42:52] mixed
[42:54] up I want to tell you something this
[43:01] morning there's something wonderful
[43:03] about a palm
[43:05] tree the first
[43:09] thing that we must
[43:15] do before the palm tree can put Roots
[43:21] down says a palm tree can be as high as
[43:24] 115 ft
[43:31] there's a beautiful quality about a palm
[43:33] tree that it grows straight
[43:37] up no matter where you SE a
[43:43] palm whether in the valley or in a
[43:47] mountain something
[43:51] inside makes her grow
[43:54] vertical she is is not grow
[43:59] cricked but before examining
[44:03] everything something we should
[44:10] notice first we must be
[44:15] S so you can go deeper with
[44:20] God so you can expand or St
[44:25] Ro thing we should do is to
[44:30] know where we will be
[44:35] planted it
[44:39] matters where we are
[44:43] placed we will be
[44:48] established because it matters a
[44:51] l where you will spread
[44:54] your you will advance with
[45:01] God County I was telling the brothers
[45:03] last week in Orange County
[45:13] um one of the things I was sharing
[45:15] brother Ro
[45:19] and told him before I came to the
[45:21] message of
[45:24] the
[45:27] through the vessel that God chose our
[45:28] pastor brother
[45:32] Titus I went through plenty of
[45:41] churches I was like that tree that is
[45:44] rooted up and placed somewhere
[45:48] else before the message I could never
[45:51] put Deep Roots
[45:53] on and so much I could never produce
[45:58] if you don't put
[46:01] Roots rooted
[46:04] completely it's hard for a tree bear
[46:08] fruit have you notice it's not fixed yet
[46:11] so it's okay um I don't know what
[46:15] happened have you
[46:19] noticed thank you brother it is fixed
[46:23] now I think it's God right
[46:29] have you seen trees that don't bear
[46:33] fruit you know if a tree is
[46:38] planted and after a season they
[46:41] transfer it runs RIS that it will
[46:49] die
[46:50] because
[46:53] pled
[46:54] established stay
[46:59] there I cannot be moving
[47:03] around tell you I made a
[47:06] decision about 12 years
[47:09] ago
[47:12] AC this
[47:14] ministry and trials have come battles
[47:18] have where my
[47:20] tree been
[47:24] threatened
[47:28] Roots have
[47:29] moved says
[47:31] something while the
[47:34] Tre it's
[47:37] swinging storms are hitting
[47:40] the the roots are
[47:44] moving stretch in
[47:46] deeper can grow
[47:52] deeper God for the
[47:54] storms
[47:56] for the
[47:57] battles but it's
[48:00] important to be
[48:08] established someone that is
[48:13] planted has made their
[48:18] decision that that will be the
[48:22] place where they will
[48:24] grow
[48:26] put Roots
[48:28] down and for
[48:31] consequence good
[48:34] consequence will bear
[48:38] fruit a
[48:40] tree when
[48:42] it's inside that
[48:45] tree something tells
[48:48] it you need to establish
[48:51] yourself let me tell you something this
[48:54] morning I believe many times looking at
[48:57] my own
[48:59] life why can
[49:02] I why can I be
[49:07] closer why do I need to look for God
[49:10] more
[49:13] maybe I'm not
[49:16] established i't planted myself how I
[49:20] it's time to
[49:21] put it's time to grow in
[49:24] God like fruitful
[49:27] trees the
[49:33] scripture he was a he was a man wherever
[49:37] he was he could bear
[49:40] fruit
[49:43] flourish but we need to be
[49:52] planted Bible says in Isaiah 40
[50:17] says that bringeth a princess to nothing
[50:19] he maketh the judges of the earth as
[50:23] vanity justification
[50:26] is
[50:27] based on knowing
[50:30] something that it's not by my
[50:32] own not me leading the
[50:37] ship it's not me
[50:40] growing it's him giving me the
[50:50] says God that bears the
[50:53] fruits at the end of
[50:58] who will make us go
[51:01] deep but we have an important
[51:03] role to
[51:07] play because sometimes we don't want to
[51:09] be
[51:12] established we must make a
[51:19] decision y they shall not be
[51:24] planted
[51:26] y they shall not be
[51:31] sown their stock shall not take root in
[51:34] the
[51:38] earth and he shall also blow upon them
[51:40] and they shall
[51:45] wi and the worldwind shall take them
[51:47] away as
[51:51] stubble look the things without
[51:54] roots do not last
[52:02] long they're easy or quick to
[52:07] die can I preach
[52:13] freely a person without making their
[52:15] decision where they're going to put
[52:17] their Roots
[52:20] down is moved easily by
[52:24] wind
[52:26] they are a cloud
[52:28] without there's no
[52:33] stability and the consequences there's
[52:35] no
[52:37] roots I want to put Roots down because
[52:41] the
[52:43] roots
[52:46] expands bear fruit to
[52:50] our time to
[52:52] go to bear fruit
[52:56] the
[52:59] people's there's the Son of
[53:02] God
[53:04] no reflect
[53:14] Christ what a beautiful
[53:21] word La pal the palm
[53:24] tree
[53:27] when is
[53:37] sewn we usually find a palm tree in
[53:39] tropical
[53:43] areas but I'm speaking about a palm Tre
[53:45] in the
[53:51] desert that we are in a A wilderness
[53:54] world
[53:57] World we're bombarded by many
[54:00] things I want to grow more
[54:03] God but many things bother me the world
[54:09] daily
[54:12] Society they show me different they
[54:15] teach me different
[54:17] things I see a war in
[54:20] my and I
[54:23] say deeper with God
[54:26] but the world is stopping
[54:28] me the world doesn't let
[54:32] me the world brings
[54:34] me I believe it's
[54:38] important to be sincere with
[54:40] God
[54:42] lord I want
[54:45] toow I don't
[54:47] care I the
[54:50] world I want to grow with
[54:54] you
[55:00] Bram
[55:02] says it doesn't matter where you
[55:05] are produce a new
[55:08] life makes a new life it calls my
[55:11] attention a palm
[55:14] tree the palm tree in the
[55:20] East because they don't bear
[55:23] fruit immediately
[55:27] look the things that
[55:32] last you don't see the result
[55:36] quick you don't see the from night to
[55:45] morning the things that last or the
[55:47] trees that really bear
[55:49] fruit they go through a
[55:54] process
[55:56] when own life and I see I'm
[56:00] here I believe you're
[56:02] here I don't think you're here wasting
[56:04] your
[56:05] time want to grow
[56:13] in cemented in the
[56:20] word the palm tree in the
[56:23] east
[56:27] they say it does not bear fruit until
[56:29] seven or 10 years after it's
[56:31] planted
[56:34] notice I tell every one of
[56:37] you don't be discouraged if you haven't
[56:40] seen anything
[56:44] yet maybe you see your life and say I
[56:46] haven't produced much or
[56:49] anything one year goes by two years go I
[56:53] don't see anything
[56:57] I don't see a
[56:59] fruit get rooted in get
[57:07] Ry to
[57:10] make and sooner or later you'll bear
[57:23] fruits
[57:27] we are told that when the palm tree and
[57:28] I'm
[57:34] closing when it puts its roots
[57:37] down in the
[57:45] wilderness it begins to open a way where
[57:47] there
[57:50] isn't that palm tree is seeking water
[57:54] you'll say
[57:58] How can there be water in the
[58:00] desert yes there can
[58:03] be can bring water
[58:05] in there's
[58:07] water you need a palm
[58:10] tree it begins to open
[58:16] way begins to crack the
[58:22] J it's not easy
[58:26] it's not easy to put Roots
[58:28] down it costs
[58:30] work it
[58:40] cost I'm going to
[58:49] work I'm not
[58:52] satisfied to be deeper
[59:01] we're told in the
[59:03] desert when a palm
[59:06] tree begins to put its roots
[59:09] down it cracks the
[59:15] ground if you can put the image for
[59:20] me until they find
[59:23] water when they find
[59:29] water then they find their
[59:36] purpose keep growing
[59:41] Church keep establishing yourself in
[59:49] God we're told palm trees are around
[59:53] oases
[59:56] if you look in the
[59:59] desert there's an
[1:00:03] oasis and it's because that palm
[1:00:06] tree fought so
[1:00:10] much broke the
[1:00:12] ground to connect with the
[1:00:15] water I am not
[1:00:18] satisfi living a
[1:00:23] superficial
[1:00:35] purpose in
[1:00:39] God by consequence bear fruit God bless
[1:00:43] [Applause]
[1:00:51] you let's read in the Book of John
[1:00:55] chapter
[1:00:58] 1 verse
[1:01:01] 45 we're speaking about
[1:01:04] Beginnings principles I'm sorry
[1:01:08] laws of how to be
[1:01:15] deeper and we want to take what our
[1:01:17] brother Alex
[1:01:20] spoke and speak to you about seriousness
[1:01:22] and sincerity
[1:01:25] you need to be
[1:01:28] serious you need to know where you'll be
[1:01:31] placed and stay
[1:01:34] there because sin is serious I repeat
[1:01:38] that sin is
[1:01:41] serious so
[1:01:44] serious that it sent the Lord Jesus
[1:01:46] Christ to the Cross it's so
[1:01:50] Ser God himself had to
[1:01:53] come and fix the case in
[1:01:56] person he did not send an angel did not
[1:01:59] send a different person sin is so
[1:02:03] serious that him
[1:02:07] himself I will go fix this
[1:02:10] problem and he himself died at the
[1:02:13] cross sin is
[1:02:16] serious and God is serious with us God
[1:02:20] son needs to be serious with
[1:02:23] him to have complete
[1:02:27] seriousness and complete sincerity with
[1:02:30] him to be
[1:02:35] establish John 145 speaks to us of
[1:02:37] Philip and Nathaniel if you can look it
[1:02:39] up because I'm going to read more than
[1:02:40] those verses
[1:02:50] [Applause]
[1:02:53] there
[1:03:02] Philip finded Nathaniel and sath unto
[1:03:04] him we have found him of whom Moses in
[1:03:06] the law and the prophets did write Jesus
[1:03:09] of Nazareth the son of
[1:03:11] Joseph I want to tell
[1:03:13] you we have found the
[1:03:17] truth that is what Philip
[1:03:20] tells we have found the
[1:03:23] truth we have found the Fountain of
[1:03:27] Life found where eternal
[1:03:30] life oh when you have found the
[1:03:33] TR you should go
[1:03:36] there you should want to be established
[1:03:39] there rooted next to
[1:03:42] Jesus planted in
[1:03:48] Jesus and Nathaniel said unto
[1:03:52] him notice the sincerity
[1:03:58] notice he wasn't trying to be a good
[1:04:01] person and be
[1:04:04] educated and not hurt anyone's
[1:04:07] feelings but he says
[1:04:12] this can there any good thing come out
[1:04:15] of
[1:04:16] Nazareth in other
[1:04:20] words this sounds like a bunch of Lies
[1:04:25] Nathaniel
[1:04:27] now although he wasn't saying anything
[1:04:31] good but he was sincere
[1:04:35] about he wasn't pretending to be
[1:04:37] anything
[1:04:38] [Applause]
[1:04:39] else let me tell you brother we
[1:04:41] shouldn't have to pretend with God there
[1:04:44] are people there are
[1:04:48] people that they can't stand when
[1:04:50] they're sincere with
[1:04:52] them they can't stand being told told
[1:04:54] the
[1:04:55] truth they can't stand being told you
[1:04:57] know why I don't like your
[1:04:59] food we always have to be
[1:05:03] careful we have to be we have we think
[1:05:06] oh we make them feel good let's not make
[1:05:08] them feel
[1:05:10] bad and there's people that can't stand
[1:05:12] the
[1:05:13] truth can't stand being told you know
[1:05:15] why you look
[1:05:17] hideous you know that that clothes
[1:05:20] doesn't look
[1:05:21] good there's people that can't stand
[1:05:23] there
[1:05:25] maybe some of us are that
[1:05:28] way God isn't that
[1:05:32] way God can stand us being sincere him
[1:05:36] not only can stand
[1:05:40] or enjoys it when we're sincere with
[1:05:45] him after Nathaniel said this that came
[1:05:48] out of his
[1:05:49] heart notice how Jesus
[1:05:53] answered Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to
[1:05:56] him coming to him and saith of
[1:06:03] him behold an Israelite
[1:06:07] indeed in whom is no
[1:06:10] G in other
[1:06:12] words this fellow is
[1:06:17] sincere love this about
[1:06:19] him he
[1:06:21] calls white white
[1:06:24] tried to please
[1:06:26] anyone simply wants the what's
[1:06:29] true he had just said he had just
[1:06:37] said Can there anything good come out of
[1:06:39] Nazareth nothing good comes out of
[1:06:42] Nazareth and Jesus
[1:06:46] answers I'm sure Jesus had just finished
[1:06:49] hearing what he
[1:06:52] said maybe not with his little
[1:06:56] but he knew who Nathaniel
[1:06:58] was and he
[1:07:00] says
[1:07:03] behold Israelite
[1:07:06] indeed
[1:07:08] Israelite there's no
[1:07:12] G when Jesus was choosing his
[1:07:16] disciples he didn't say this about Peter
[1:07:20] and he didn't say this about any other
[1:07:22] disciple what about
[1:07:27] Nathaniel this fellow is a true
[1:07:31] Israelite and there's no
[1:07:33] go there's no
[1:07:36] hypocrisy he's not
[1:07:38] hiding to please
[1:07:41] anyone is a man without
[1:07:45] G Nathaniel sayith unto
[1:07:48] him whence knowest th
[1:07:50] me in other words that's the way I am
[1:07:54] Jesus answered him
[1:07:56] said before that Philip called
[1:08:00] the when thou was under the Fig Tree I
[1:08:02] saw
[1:08:03] the Nathaniel answered sayith unto him
[1:08:09] Rabbi Thou Art the Son of
[1:08:12] God Thou Art the king of Israel now
[1:08:18] notice how tremendous this man
[1:08:22] left
[1:08:25] or when from saying nothing good from
[1:08:27] Nazareth can come to say
[1:08:31] Rabbi th art the Son of
[1:08:36] God th art the king of
[1:08:39] Israel
[1:08:41] why what a tremendous
[1:08:46] man that can be sincere with
[1:08:50] God God loves someone that's
[1:08:52] sincere
[1:08:54] because
[1:08:55] sincerity and
[1:08:58] serious are linked
[1:09:01] together when someone is
[1:09:04] sincere that person can become to be
[1:09:07] serious and when someone is
[1:09:11] serious they take seriously what they're
[1:09:15] saying and someone standing seriously
[1:09:18] with
[1:09:19] God someone that can go far with God
[1:09:23] because they're not
[1:09:25] playing they're not
[1:09:27] pretending if they do it they'll do
[1:09:30] it I say this is
[1:09:33] true because I will stand with
[1:09:37] it I will give all I am for
[1:09:44] itet got the queen
[1:09:46] of
[1:09:48] she she stood up for
[1:09:52] Solomon she was
[1:09:54] willing
[1:09:57] ready when she found the
[1:10:00] truth when I find the
[1:10:02] truth when I find what's
[1:10:05] real I will support with everything I
[1:10:11] have says when you find the
[1:10:13] truth when you find what's
[1:10:16] right
[1:10:18] supported with everything you
[1:10:20] [Applause]

[1:10:28] amen message of hidden life in
[1:10:32] Christ brother BR

[1:12:39] here after speaking about the oak and
[1:12:41] the
[1:12:42] mushroom and roots and being
[1:12:47] placed and then he tells us to be
[1:12:50] sincere
[1:12:52] sincerity
[1:12:57] means that you've peeled back those
[1:13:03] layers of those initial
[1:13:06] feelings because sometimes we have
[1:13:08] initial
[1:13:10] feelings and you've dug
[1:13:13] deeper and have seen
[1:13:16] deeper what the root of
[1:13:19] the what do I really believe come on
[1:13:23] Church
[1:13:26] sometimes we're not sincere with
[1:13:29] ourselves we think because we're in
[1:13:30] church we're
[1:13:33] okay but we haven't peeled back the
[1:13:37] layers of our
[1:13:40] feelings of our
[1:13:42] thoughts and go
[1:13:45] deeper and say do I really believe what
[1:13:48] I'm saying I
[1:13:50] believe am I truly where am I truly
[1:13:54] where I'm saying I
[1:13:55] am Church how many have gone
[1:13:58] excited and say yes I'm going to do that
[1:14:01] oh that sounds good but be
[1:14:07] sincere let let those initial emotions
[1:14:10] or
[1:14:11] feelings meditate a little and
[1:14:16] say after I got
[1:14:19] excited do I still want to do
[1:14:22] that
[1:14:24] is that what I'm truly
[1:14:27] facing do I really know what awaits
[1:14:30] for or am I just getting
[1:14:33] excited come on
[1:14:35] Church many of us only get excited in
[1:14:39] church and that's why we leave and
[1:14:41] nothing
[1:14:42] changes because we were never
[1:14:45] sincere we only got
[1:14:48] [Applause]
[1:14:49] excited we only get
[1:14:52] excited
[1:14:53] and don't look
[1:14:56] deeper deeper under our
[1:15:00] emotion beyond what the preacher
[1:15:04] said and and think what are they trying
[1:15:06] to tell
[1:15:07] me this should change my
[1:15:10] life this is not just any type of
[1:15:13] change this is something
[1:15:17] serious a walk with God is serious it's
[1:15:21] not just anything
[1:15:23] it's not just lift your hand and say
[1:15:26] Amen it's a life
[1:15:29] changing it's a change in
[1:15:33] [Applause]
[1:15:36] nature do I really know what I'm
[1:15:40] facing am I really
[1:15:43] willing that's to be
[1:15:46] sincere and I
[1:15:50] understand you can be sincerely
[1:15:53] mistaken but brother brandham
[1:15:58] says I'll throw my lot in with someone
[1:16:01] that is sincerely
[1:16:03] Mist because they're at least standing
[1:16:05] for what they
[1:16:08] believe than someone
[1:16:13] halfway that's why the Bible
[1:16:16] says I prefer you be cold or
[1:16:21] hot you're going to be mistaken but
[1:16:23] stand what's what you're mistaken
[1:16:26] for but in this morning we're not
[1:16:29] mistaken we have found the
[1:16:32] truth and if there's a higher truth in
[1:16:35] this tell me where it
[1:16:38] is this is the highest truth I
[1:16:41] found I need to be so sincere as I can
[1:16:52] be
[1:16:58] watch how brother brandham
[1:17:02] says do this to yourself and mean
[1:17:05] it come to the Lord Jesus
[1:17:08] say God you know what my fault
[1:17:14] is you know I have these little things I
[1:17:16] have to battle every
[1:17:18] day and I have a hard time of doing
[1:17:21] it that's why I'm standing here notice
[1:17:25] the prophet he's telling
[1:17:28] us you need to be sincere with
[1:17:32] God that's the way to be
[1:17:36] placed part of the principles of a
[1:17:39] place of going deeper with
[1:17:42] God you need to be
[1:17:45] sincere go beyond your
[1:17:48] feelings you need to see your
[1:17:51] mistakes God prefers
[1:17:53] someone angry than
[1:17:58] someone pretending to be
[1:18:02] happy say God I'm angry with you come on
[1:18:07] church not everything is
[1:18:09] happening but let's be sincere with him
[1:18:13] let's say
[1:18:15] Lord this journey is
[1:18:17] hard it hurts to leave the
[1:18:21] evil my soul my heart
[1:18:24] hurts I don't want to let
[1:18:26] go come on God prefer someone that
[1:18:30] way that says Lord I love I love the
[1:18:34] world I love the world a
[1:18:36] lot let's not pretend to be Saints
[1:18:41] here let's not pretend oh
[1:18:44] yes tell God I love worldly
[1:18:48] music tell God I love this
[1:18:51] flesh help help me do that man help
[1:18:55] [Applause]
[1:19:09] me God is able with your sincerity God
[1:19:12] can
[1:19:13] endure and I
[1:19:17] understand there are many of us that
[1:19:19] have never been able to be
[1:19:21] sincere
[1:19:26] sometimes we
[1:19:27] can't someone being sincere with
[1:19:30] us there's people that can't stand it as
[1:19:33] a
[1:19:35] pastor I see people in different
[1:19:39] levels if I there's people that I see
[1:19:41] and I I know if I tell them you're
[1:19:43] messing the next service they won't come
[1:19:45] to
[1:19:47] [Applause]
[1:19:50] church that's I need to watch How I say
[1:19:52] say things but there are
[1:19:55] people that love
[1:19:58] sincerity that love when someone tells
[1:20:01] you're messing
[1:20:04] up you're not being
[1:20:08] real there are people that can't
[1:20:12] stand their entire life trying to please
[1:20:15] someone
[1:20:19] else and they never say when they don't
[1:20:21] like something
[1:20:24] there are people that can't be sincere
[1:20:26] or don't know
[1:20:28] how because they are
[1:20:32] used to pretending to be something
[1:20:34] they're
[1:20:35] not but God can
[1:20:40] end I'll tell you this your brother
[1:20:42] might not be able to endure so be
[1:20:45] careful your wife or your husband might
[1:20:47] not be able to endure to be truec with
[1:20:49] them but if there's someone that endures
[1:20:52] is God
[1:20:54] God prefers someone sincere their heart
[1:20:57] someone that can tell
[1:20:58] God look at all the sin there's in
[1:21:02] me like the
[1:21:05] Centurion when God told him if you
[1:21:07] believe if you can believe all things
[1:21:09] are
[1:21:10] possible C said
[1:21:12] I I believe but help me believe there's
[1:21:17] a lot of unbelief in
[1:21:19] me sometimes we have to say God have a
[1:21:23] lot of
[1:21:26] unbelief Don't Be Afraid with
[1:21:29] God sometimes you have to say Lord I
[1:21:31] don't believe
[1:21:33] you I don't believe
[1:21:35] you but I want to believe
[1:21:39] you forgive me for not believing

[1:25:37] God it's time to see
[1:25:42] beyond have the courage to look
[1:25:46] beyond your
[1:25:48] presentation towards the
[1:25:51] rest begin to
[1:25:54] see so what really is inside of
[1:26:01] you I want you to be
[1:26:07] sincere be
[1:26:09] sincere with a few
[1:26:16] questions with
[1:26:19] God and so God can help you
[1:26:26] are you happier in sin than in the
[1:26:28] things of
[1:26:31] God you need to ask yourselves these
[1:26:35] questions to get deeper with
[1:26:39] God now if you see it in the
[1:26:42] flesh you will say yes if you are
[1:26:48] sincere I'm sure no one will say yes
[1:26:51] because
[1:26:53] everyone's going to think this or that
[1:26:55] about
[1:26:57] you but let's just begin on the first
[1:27:03] layer if you see it in the first
[1:27:06] layer through the
[1:27:08] flesh you'll say
[1:27:11] yes and many of us are even more
[1:27:14] happy yes sir I yes sir I
[1:27:18] see so watch a football
[1:27:20] game I see you more happier doing that
[1:27:23] than here in
[1:27:30] church there are people that look
[1:27:32] happier when they're going to watch a
[1:27:33] game or get their pop watch a movie they
[1:27:36] put their their slippers
[1:27:39] on oh how comfortable a big
[1:27:45] smile I let's be
[1:27:51] sincere that are happier out there than
[1:27:53] in
[1:27:54] here let's be sincere with
[1:27:57] God say you know what sin excites me
[1:28:03] Hallelujah but then let's go beyond
[1:28:07] that when all of that
[1:28:10] passes am I
[1:28:18] happier after those initial feelings
[1:28:21] pass
[1:28:23] how do I
[1:28:25] remain do I feel
[1:28:29] empty do I feel
[1:28:32] sad do I feel
[1:28:36] lonely when that first layer of emotion
[1:28:41] passes and I go
[1:28:49] deeper when that moment of gratification
[1:29:00] passes when the high left you when the
[1:29:02] buzz left
[1:29:06] you when you did whatever excited you
[1:29:10] after and then it
[1:29:12] passed how are you
[1:29:15] now are you
[1:29:18] happier are you
[1:29:20] happier
[1:29:22] now you're being more
[1:29:25] sincere because now you're going deeper
[1:29:27] in your
[1:29:30] heart and you're saying Lord I'm not as
[1:29:33] happy because when all those feelings
[1:29:37] pass when the friends left
[1:29:40] me I I realize I feel so bad inside so
[1:29:45] empty
[1:29:48] inside see that's what God wants that
[1:29:52] you go
[1:29:56] deeper and be courageous
[1:30:00] enough to
[1:30:02] recognize
[1:30:04] Lord the reason I am
[1:30:06] here is because I'm not happier out
[1:30:11] there I'm not happy doing what I
[1:30:14] want otherwise I'd be better off but I
[1:30:18] want to tell
[1:30:19] you the truth of the truth of the truth
[1:30:23] is that I'm only happy with
[1:30:26] you I am only truly happy with you and
[1:30:31] Lord if this makes me
[1:30:34] happy help me be serious with this not
[1:30:38] be playing with

[1:31:23] [Music]
[1:31:29] stand I was
[1:31:30] [Music]
[1:31:32] meditating in the scripture of Isaiah
[1:31:37] 53 talks about the Lord Jesus
[1:31:40] Christ and
[1:31:43] says like roots and dry
[1:31:48] ground like roots in dry ground
[1:31:54] there's no Beauty in
[1:31:57] [Music]
[1:31:59] it but like roots in dry
[1:32:03] [Music]
[1:32:06] ground and I say God did not put
[1:32:10] Jesus next to the
[1:32:13] water God put him like a
[1:32:16] root speaking of
[1:32:20] Jesus
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:25] because it's in the moment of
[1:32:29] drought it's in the hard
[1:32:33] place it's in
[1:32:37] pain where we become more
[1:32:41] sincere it's in
[1:32:43] pain and
[1:32:46] tears we turn more
[1:32:50] sincere
[1:32:52] that's why I made you go through the
[1:32:55] W to know what was in your
[1:32:59] heart everyone can worship when
[1:33:01] everything
[1:33:03] go everyone can pretend to in a good
[1:33:08] place but put them in a tough
[1:33:11] situation put them in a
[1:33:14] painful the true colors will
