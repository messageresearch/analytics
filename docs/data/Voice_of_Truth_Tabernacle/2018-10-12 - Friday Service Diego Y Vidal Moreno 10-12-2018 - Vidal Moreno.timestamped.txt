[1:02:50] a great adversary are you not saying
[1:02:52] you're a ho the Allison we're not
[1:02:55] Rosario you know in any and it's true
[1:02:57] when an amigo es verdad you know but one
[1:03:01] thing
[1:03:01] I've learned in in this in this work
[1:03:03] we're all ok aprendido etc bajo that I
[1:03:06] used to struggle with so much ok Yatta
[1:03:08] Yatta con mucho was a was it was my
[1:03:11] attitude ok why but I am a ceramic
[1:03:14] important you know not not in the sense
[1:03:16] that I had a bad attitude on el sentido
[1:03:19] que estaba the Malo more but uh but I
[1:03:22] always struggled with my own abilities
[1:03:24] simply what I a con mis propios I really
[1:03:27] you know what I couldn't couldn't do lo
[1:03:29] que por dia nobody I said you know there
[1:03:31] was a lot of things I just can't do it
[1:03:33] oh yeah muchas cosas no lo puedo lager
[1:03:36] are you see that that shouldn't be the
[1:03:37] language of a Christian mean I said not
[1:03:39] every other settle my head in Christian
[1:03:41] you know these these guys that I work
[1:03:44] with los compañeros kaho you see that
[1:03:47] they're not they're not all Christian
[1:03:49] todos no song Cristiano's I mean they
[1:03:53] have they're pretty bad mouth and then
[1:03:55] my last you know and they do a lot of
[1:03:58] things that you know maybe we do
[1:04:00] inclusive our sin causes mulaskey a lo
[1:04:03] mejor nosotros también a semo's oh you
[1:04:05] know but but one thing that I have
[1:04:07] learned from them algo que aprendido the
[1:04:09] ellos is that they are they like a
[1:04:12] challenge
[1:04:12] Escalus whose town reto you see they
[1:04:14] don't like things they don't like things
[1:04:17] that are easy no les gusta la cosa fácil
[1:04:19] do they like they like change
[1:04:21] cambio see the harder it is Lamaze
[1:04:24] difficile can see the more exciting it
[1:04:26] is for the mass emotion antic Apsara hey
[1:04:28] yo you know and the devil comes and he
[1:04:30] tells you you can't do something yeah I
[1:04:32] love you an 80-second open I said you
[1:04:34] know as Christian if I'm a Christian oh
[1:04:37] you know we shouldn't we shouldn't shy
[1:04:39] away from that
[1:04:39] almost a quarter there so you know we we
[1:04:42] should we should we should take a step
[1:04:43] forward
[1:04:44] yeah I'm all set to my don't pass waddle
[1:04:45] on you know he tells you you know you're
[1:04:47] not a Christian and sorry ladies who
[1:04:49] stand with some Christian look what you
[1:04:50] did Mira lo que sister she's accusing

[1:04:55] times we step back yeah that's estamos
[1:04:57] oompah so I you know and we don't we
[1:05:00] don't do anything no somos nada say
[1:05:02] maybe he's right it is Somoza la mejor
[1:05:04] tiene la razón we should change our
[1:05:06] attitude the very almost can be on a
[1:05:09] stroke important you know because the
[1:05:10] Bible says porque la vela he said you
[1:05:12] know the Bible says

[1:05:16] total up whether increased in Christ who
[1:05:19] strengthens me I'm a fourth Alessa you
