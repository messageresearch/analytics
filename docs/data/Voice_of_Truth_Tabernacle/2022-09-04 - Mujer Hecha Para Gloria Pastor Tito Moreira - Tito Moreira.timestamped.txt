[25:28] we'll be speaking dilemma on our subject
[25:32] restaurant
[25:33] restoring the woman
[25:42] and we'll focus on our title
[25:46] gloria woman made for glory genesis
[25:49] genesis 3 15.
[26:03] and i will put enmity between thee and
[26:05] the woman and between thy seed and her
[26:07] seed it shall bruise thy head and thou
[26:09] shalt bruise his feet
[26:11] his heel forgive me let us pray
[26:15] heavenly father
[26:17] we come before you
[26:22] to give you all honor and glory lord
[26:26] because you are the only one that
[26:27] deserves it
[26:29] you're the only one
[26:32] that deserves everything from us
[26:36] or you deserve
[27:33] who speak on this subject
[27:36] it's very complex
[27:40] because it has many phases
[27:44] it has many sides or angles
[28:08] and teach us what type of bride god is
[28:10] seeking
[28:12] because jesus christ is
[28:28] the
[28:29] wedding supper of the lamb says
[28:33] so god sends a message
[28:39] to search for a bribe
[28:56] and
[29:09] she judges herself it is a senor it says
[29:12] lord
[29:14] what pleases you
[29:16] and what doesn't please you
[29:19] do you realize
[29:22] why we needed a message
[29:40] [Applause]
[30:49] better said proverbs 19 13.
[30:53] proverbs 19 13.
[31:02] a foolish son is the calamity of his
[31:04] father and the contentions of a wife are
[31:06] they continue dropping
[31:10] i believe that man
[31:15] although you don't have to okay
[31:28] but when there are problems with a woman
[31:31] i problemas there are problems
[31:36] and it's something terrible
[31:38] for the entire household
[31:58] but the foolish plucketh it down with
[31:59] her hands
[32:03] so we want to set the woman on the right
[32:05] place
[32:09] the woman has an important position in
[32:10] the body of christ
[33:06] [Applause]
[33:07] the woman feel good
[33:21] you were made for something great
[33:24] inside the woman
[33:26] there's something in her
[33:29] okay
[33:31] she was made for something great
[33:35] when a man comes
[33:40] and shows her how she can be great
[33:44] that caused the woman's attention
[33:47] follow me for a moment
[33:49] the serpent
[33:51] told her
[33:53] according to the message of the hour
[33:57] that from the woman would come
[34:00] the messiah
[34:03] now that was true
[34:16] [Applause]
[34:23] [Applause]
[34:32] simply change the story
[34:34] that's all he did
[34:38] the serpent tells eve
[34:41] look
[34:42] this is the way
[34:46] that you can bring forth
[34:48] [Applause]
[35:00] is
[35:41] she'll give you a meal
[35:53] she multiplies and enlarges what is
[35:55] given to her
[35:58] frustration so if you give her
[36:00] frustration
[36:05] they'll multiply and enlarge that
[36:17] if you give a woman
[36:19] um
[36:21] jealousy jealousy and vigilance
[36:24] nova
[36:26] it won't produce anything good from that
[36:31] if you give a woman jealousy and
[36:33] vigilance
[36:36] yes she likes protection
[36:43] if you give her jealousy and vigilance
[36:45] that is not equal to protection
[36:49] that will only give you somebody
[37:04] if you give her
[37:05] chauvinism
[37:34] they need to obey him
[37:38] and that's not the way
[37:41] we'll speak on that
[37:44] if you give chauvinism to the woman
[38:02] he won't
[38:28] she will let her let you guide her
[38:35] the woman was made
[38:39] to receive something from the man's
[38:41] behalf
[38:43] and give him something better
[38:48] a woman
[38:51] you give her an immature man
[38:55] and she will help that immature man
[39:18] the man and the woman need each other
[39:22] the woman
[39:24] helps the man yes or no hello
[39:40] needs that's the minimum
[39:44] but she helps
[39:46] makes him a better person
[39:49] how many here are marriages
[39:52] you don't need to raise your hands
[39:54] i don't want to get you into problems
[39:57] but you are a better man
[39:59] because you have a good woman
[40:03] that's right
[40:39] wherefore he saith the wake thou that
[40:40] sleepless and arise from the dead and
[40:42] christ shall give thee life
[40:45] desire to be enlightened
[40:50] no
[41:20] wherefore be ye not unwise but
[41:22] understanding what the will of the lord
[41:24] is
[41:29] and be not drunk with wine worm and
[41:32] wherein is excess but be filled with the
[41:34] spirit
[41:35] uh
[41:36] now after he says this
[41:39] yesterday verse 21 says this
[41:44] submitting yourselves one to another in
[41:46] the fear of god
[42:00] we need to understand what we're doing
[42:04] that we should be enlightened
[42:11] believe that the word
[42:31] submit yourselves into your own husbands
[42:33] as unto the lord
[42:36] now men enjoy this scripture
[42:43] because it's saying that the woman
[42:44] should submit herself
[42:47] and we read the scriptures
[42:49] but we stop there
[42:53] but as they say keep reading
[42:56] [Applause]
[43:09] and he is the savior of the
[43:24] but then he speaks to the husbands
[43:27] husbands love your wives
[43:30] christ also love the church
[43:33] gave himself for it
[43:35] that he might sanctify him
[43:40] and cleanse it with the washing of the
[43:41] word
[43:42] washing of the water by the words
[43:46] notice what verse 27 says
[43:48] repeat four
[43:50] para
[43:51] four oracle
[44:07] [Applause]
[44:44] to a great purpose
[44:55] we're going to speak the woman in the
[44:57] animal kingdom in nature
[44:59] she's
[45:01] a strong male
[45:43] are you understanding
[45:58] not because she wants him so much
[46:02] wants to produce something good
[46:07] the product that she'll produce
[46:11] something that's worth it
[46:44] is that what they're going to produce
[46:52] she knows she'll produce weakly
[47:34] so they are worried for what they'll
[47:36] produce
[47:38] it matters a lot to them
[47:41] what will come out of them
[47:44] what they're going to produce
[47:50] this was the way the serpent came into
[47:52] east porquelle
[47:54] because he promised her produce
[47:57] that she would produce something great
[48:00] she didn't know
[48:02] but she believes
[48:18] this
[48:31] oh
[48:47] he might sanctify her limp
[48:53] cleanser with the washing of the water
[48:56] gloriosa
[48:58] that he presented to himself
[49:18] [Applause]
[50:09] the life of god
[50:11] [Applause]
[50:11] [Music]
[50:23] through the hands of god
[50:29] [Music]
[50:38] surrenders gladly
[50:52] she sees
[50:58] that he might present it to himself a
[51:01] glorious church
[51:06] we know that genesis 24.
[51:09] if you have your bible
[51:11] and if you don't it's fine
[51:14] i don't think i'll read it
[51:20] genesis 24 speaks to us of a type of the
[51:23] bride
[51:26] eliezer the servant of abraham
[51:32] for a bride for his lord his master
[51:45] when he goes and searches for a woman
[51:50] he searched for string characteristics
[51:57] where she needs to be convinced
[52:29] but for what reason no matter
[52:32] just because
[52:35] just because he has the title
[52:41] myself to you is the question women have
[52:58] is to the husband
[53:03] it's what it says
[53:06] it was with abraham and sarah
[53:09] says
[53:11] in the end times
[53:24] and he says there was a union between
[53:26] abram and sarah
[53:43] [Music]
[54:16] [Music]
[54:21] follows her husband gladly
[54:24] amira when she sees cuando ella when she
[54:27] sees
[54:30] that he guides her to the correct place
[54:35] but there's many of us
[54:41] want them to follow us just because we
[54:43] have the title sorry but you're so
[54:45] elongated just because i'm well i'm the
[54:47] man yes okay
[54:48] and and
[54:50] you know what
[54:57] this is one of the reasons why women
[54:59] have pain to follow their man
[55:02] because they're more wiser than he is
[55:18] if
[55:31] is
[55:46] is asking herself
[55:49] if i'm going to be just as you
[55:53] query
[55:54] do i want to be like you
[55:57] hallelujah yeah
[56:00] sometimes
[56:04] [Music]
[56:37] let me read this
[56:48] um this is the last one
[56:52] the master is a super sign this is
[56:58] but now he said you've got to make your
[57:00] choice where you go
[57:06] and look quickly as soon as she heard
[57:07] about isaac
[57:10] before she had ever saw him dijo yo she
[57:13] said i will go
[57:15] notice now rebecca rebecca
[57:20] accepted to follow him
[57:23] without even seeing him
[57:29] it's not about how it looks know how he
[57:32] looks or it's not about how he looks
[57:37] sometimes we think the woman follows a
[57:39] man for how handsome he is
[57:43] she does not follow him for how handsome
[57:45] he is
[57:48] women are very wise
[57:52] they hate to
[58:04] amen
[58:10] she did not follow isaac
[58:13] she did not follow this man
[58:17] just because he was handsome
[58:20] actually
[58:48] man
[58:58] now i don't believe rebecca followed him
[59:00] because she said oh he's great and big
[59:02] muscles
[59:05] why did she follow him
[59:08] what convinced her
[59:10] so follow me
[59:13] she had the decision to make
[59:30] purpose
[59:33] was because she believed
[59:37] that would come out of her iva grande
[59:40] would be something great
[59:44] when
[59:53] well god promised abraham and isaac dude
[59:56] you're descending
[1:00:37] [Applause]
[1:00:53] [Music]
[1:01:33] she was a blood relative to him
[1:01:40] that was abraham's brother's child
[1:01:45] isaac and rebecca were first cousins
[1:01:50] blood relation
[1:02:05] for the very god that predestinated the
[1:02:07] christ
[1:02:09] who was the lamb
[1:02:11] before the foundation
[1:02:14] the church itself
[1:02:16] its name
[1:02:18] was put on
[1:02:45] away from her mother or brother
[1:02:48] i want you to see this brethren
[1:02:52] it wasn't how wonderful isaac spoke to
[1:02:54] you
[1:02:55] i believe
[1:02:57] all of my hearts
[1:03:00] that will
[1:03:28] oh
[1:04:08] hallelujah
[1:04:38] it's
[1:04:45] speaking of a woman that went
[1:04:47] parachuting
[1:04:51] and when she was falling the parachute
[1:04:54] did not
[1:04:55] open
[1:05:00] ejected and choked the instructions
[1:05:05] and in that moment she realized she
[1:05:07] would die
[1:05:11] says that she fell on the ground and was
[1:05:12] surprised she was still alive and she's
[1:05:14] telling me
[1:05:16] of what happened to her uh
[1:05:19] i'm summarizing
[1:05:48] she says she noticed her legs were not
[1:05:51] responding
[1:05:56] she broke her spine
[1:06:00] she said she felt a pain so great on
[1:06:14] she's trying to understand where the
[1:06:15] pain is coming from
[1:06:18] until she realized
[1:06:20] that the pain was not something physical
[1:06:25] the pain was coming
[1:06:28] and began when she noticed
[1:06:42] and now her life wasn't worth anything
[1:07:10] and i read the scripture
[1:07:36] [Music]
[1:07:40] i believe uh beautiful is an
[1:07:42] understatement of how
[1:07:44] very beautiful she actually was
[1:07:49] in chapter 30 verse one says
[1:07:54] and when rachel saw that she bear jacob
[1:07:57] no children
[1:07:59] rachel envied her sister
[1:08:02] now notice raquel rachel
[1:08:06] pay attention please raquel rachel
[1:08:21] the one that everything fit her well
[1:08:25] elia and leah
[1:08:29] was the one that no one wanted to see
[1:08:35] she was an oddball
[1:08:38] no one set eyes on her
[1:08:43] but here's rachel embiliando alea
[1:08:46] envin her sister leah raquel rachel
[1:08:50] embiando
[1:09:03] or rachel says to jacob
[1:09:08] and said unto jacob give me children or
[1:09:10] else i die
[1:09:14] to see the pain inside this woman
[1:09:18] because she wants to
[1:09:32] where she didn't
[1:09:45] they're not going anywhere
[1:10:06] [Music]
[1:10:13] glory of
[1:10:14] jesus church
[1:10:17] his bride hella glorious
[1:10:19] prisoner of the lord jesus christ
[1:10:23] gloria no you say does god need glory no
[1:10:27] the glory in the world
[1:10:34] [Applause]
[1:11:11] a woman no establish isn't searching no
[1:11:14] necessity
[1:11:16] her
[1:11:16] main need is not versa
[1:11:21] we see it here with rachel
[1:11:25] she's probably the most beautiful in
[1:11:27] that region
[1:11:29] she was dying of pain
[1:11:35] the main need of a woman
[1:12:06] is
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:34] who will
[1:13:02] because the moon does not have its own
[1:13:04] light
[1:13:10] and i'm getting into other things
[1:13:13] that's why i tell you this is very
[1:13:15] complex
[1:13:45] and the message of the philadelphian
[1:13:47] church age
[1:13:52] this is for the husbands and wives for
[1:13:54] both
[1:13:55] speaking on the woman
[1:14:26] a woman has no desire to follow him
[1:14:30] you have to follow me because it's god's
[1:14:31] word
[1:14:34] see
[1:14:35] yes
[1:14:39] but she will not do it gladly
[1:14:44] when that man submits himself
[1:14:48] to his kids
[1:14:49] that god has given him
[1:14:53] he gives purpose to his wife
[1:14:57] and that's what she was born for
[1:14:58] brethren
[1:15:01] so give birth to something great
[1:15:04] gloria to reflect glory
[1:15:07] see what brother branham says
[1:15:11] he reads isaiah 22 22.
[1:15:17] and the key of the house of david will i
[1:15:19] lay upon his shoulders
[1:15:32] the spur uses this old testament
[1:15:34] reference concerning the lord jesus
[1:15:36] christ and his ministry in the church
[1:15:39] significa what the key of david's
[1:15:41] signatures
[1:15:43] at that time is mere shadow while sombra
[1:15:46] is complete in jesus which is now
[1:15:47] fulfilled in jesus
[1:15:50] christ
[1:16:04] but what
[1:16:19] hands
[1:16:21] it's not worn around his neck
[1:16:25] it is not placed in the hands of other
[1:16:26] men
[1:16:29] or the verse could not be saved
[1:16:40] no man has the right but jesus himself
[1:16:45] but where is
[1:17:08] just read then the government shall be
[1:17:09] under over his shoulder and the
[1:17:11] government upon his shoulder
[1:17:56] he is
[1:18:24] is
[1:18:51] she paid the price for her
[1:18:55] she be lost
[1:19:00] fully committed to him
[1:19:03] he accepts
[1:19:45] foreign
[1:19:52] [Applause]
[1:19:58] the light of my woman is to obey
[1:20:14] i believe there are that do
[1:20:16] so

[1:54:53] brother branham says
[1:54:56] that those keys are on the shoulder
[1:55:02] he said that principal will be by over

[1:55:05] [Music]
[1:55:10] we begin to think what do you have in
[1:55:12] your shoulders
[1:55:14] what's on the shoulder
[1:55:33] where she takes her veil off and puts it
[1:55:35] over the man's shoulder
[1:55:37] [Music]
[1:55:38] why the shoulder
[1:55:40] is the key in the shoulder
[1:55:44] brother
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:56:13] [Music]
[1:56:32] [Music]
[1:56:41] into so much detail about that
[1:56:47] i was listening to a poet and and i like
[1:56:50] what he said
[1:56:52] look at the shoulders of the lord jesus
[1:56:54] christ
[1:56:57] because that's where we're going to put
[1:56:59] our trust
[1:57:00] this is
[1:57:02] our shoulders and who to cry on hombros
[1:57:08] shoulders we can lay our heads
[1:57:12] the shoulders that take all the the
[1:57:13] weight
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:16] that takes the weight away from us
[1:57:19] [Music]

[1:58:01] [Music]
[1:58:03] of her husband
[1:58:15] [Music]
[1:58:32] but these suits make us look like we
[1:58:33] have big shoulders
[1:58:37] that's why a woman says man a man looks
[1:58:39] so good
[1:58:41] because you even get shoulders
[1:58:43] [Music]
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:58:52] they make them so the shoulders look a
[1:58:54] little bit more firm and more bigger
[1:58:56] you look at a man
[1:59:14] later
[1:59:24] [Music]
[1:59:38] if the woman cannot come and lay herself
[1:59:41] on them
[1:59:42] [Music]
