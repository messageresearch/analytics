sisters I greet you in the name of Lord Jesus Christ I want to thank our pastor Pastor for the privilege for allowing me to be up here as well as my brother Gustavo Gustavo I would like to First say um uh to remember keep our brothers in prayer that are in Mexico our pastor may they may God bring them home safe and as well a prayer for Brother John amen I think we we believe in a god that is it's so great that he can do anything just as he left a Lazarus from the dead he can do so with anybody if we can please open our scriptures to the book of First Samuel chapter 18 Samuel um to 15 and then we'll be after that we'll be going to proverbs 4 23. and then in the book of Acts Chapter 13 Verse 22. first Samuel chapter 18 verse 14 through 15 says like this is and David behaved himself wisely in all of his ways and the Lord was with him foreign saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of him now in Proverbs chapter 4 verse 23 yeah it says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life amen and then one last scripture in the book of Acts chapter 13 says like this and when he had removed him he raised him he raised up unto them David to be their King to whom he also gave their testimony and said I have found David the son of Jesse they can Lord to be here tonight Lord an opportunity that not many of us not many people had an opportunity Lord to worship your name and give you glory Gloria Lord and and may not be me Lord Lord but maybe you speaking to me Lord put me aside so that your people can understand what I'm trying to say we also asked for our pastor Lord and brother John we put all this in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ um did did you realize that David that aside from Jesus that more scripture is written about David than any other biblical character there's 66 66 chapters about him 56 a reference in the New Testament uh sequence but he also wrote 73 of the 150 Psalms so David was a musician he was a leader he was a warrior and he was a poeta you know David has some deep laws in his life but he also had some highs in his life and I think many of us can relate to that has brought us up David survived I believe that David survived all the things that he went through because of his heart now our title for this evening is a man after mine own heart yes so God wants people that are according to his heart not to the heart of somebody else but to the heart of God and as we read it says someone that which shall fulfill all of my will you know where is your heart tonight is it is it at work are you thinking about school why are you thinking about him or are you are you trusting in God tonight that whatever you're going through he's going to take you out foreign David knew that no matter what came to him he has something sure he wanted what God wants but he wanted what God wants there's five things that I was able to get from from David I think was his willingness to acknowledge his mistakes do we acknowledge our mistakes sometimes you know because sometimes you know and we do things we're not supposed to yeah but we don't acknowledge them and we don't ask God for forgiveness and we don't repent I say this for myself I don't know about you but I say this for myself number two the humility to recognize that he was weakness all right Saul thought that he could do it all the people of Israel wanted the king brothers that Israel wants to be like the rest of the Nations they wanted a king but he says that that's where they messed up because to start off they already had a king and that was God yes God was their King but they wanted to be like the why do we want to be like the rest number three the courage to step up in challenging situations [Music] strong passion Fuerte and love for godos do you love God tonight brothers and sisters the strength to change the strength should be different different than the others you know because David was a man into God's Own Hearts you know and David every time that he did something something that wasn't right he would ask God for forgiveness he will repentia because he wanted to be different he didn't want to be like the rest I believe that David's greatest assets there's going on there's a lot of stuff in the world today that try to steal our heart okay try to take us away from the things of God you know and David faced a lot of those challenges where he was faced with situations that you know he could have easily stepped aside or moved away from God but he still wanted what God wants and that's what we should have we should we should desires to have what God what God wants for us but then there's a different side that that the Bible describes that the hearts can also be deceitful therefore with must also pay attention to our hearts attention because I believe that God is constantly checking our hearts I know that many of us sometimes we're in situations you know where we're at and then all of a sudden we're like oh God I messed up you know but it's how I respond to my problems now I respond to my brothers or sisters When God Says to my Palms when my flesh says what what I want to do is it says like this now what a beautiful picture this gives us they say okay how God must be so broken heart because of our conducted after he has received us as Sons and Daughters the way we act and Carry On and grudges we hold us and first is and the little things that doesn't that should not be and yet calling ourselves Sons and Daughters of God we must be Gallant men we must be Gallant woman we must hold ourselves up [Music] man he was and God said thou art a man unto my own Hearts you know I I believe David really set the example in his time because he stood out from the rest it wasn't like the rest the Bible the Bible tells us that Saul was afraid of David you know it is one thing to have a wise heart and it's another thing to behave wisely as I read in proverbs 4 23 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life I like the way it says it in English because out of it are the issues of problems are the problem is life how many can say men tonight we need we need people like David this is people that are willing to stand up for God people that are willing to set themselves on the front line to die for others in the message the great warrior David Guerrero David it says he was a Believer he was elected he was called he was anointed and he was placed Hallelujah no matter where you where you're just important you say well brother I wasn't called to be a preacher you might be called to be a housewife but you got your position in Christ Jesus by the Holy Ghost and it says amen your Justice mustache David as the rest of them was how many David's here tonight many of the times muchas versus you know I I think we we we put God aside we put God in a little corner and we say God we I don't need you you know God I don't I don't need you in my problems but God is saying let me be that hell for your problems for the things that you were going through I want to be there with you but sometimes we're just so so so selfish we don't let him control us we don't see guidance from God and like I said this is speaking for myself sometimes we just put God in a little corner but you know brother Brown says that Jesus is just an arms length away so Jesus is right there with you then how do we seem to push God aside I don't know about you but this is for me you know because I I personally I there's there's there's times where I I put God aside with the way I act with the way I behave you know and it makes me think so selfish of myself that somebody One Day in India died on the cross for you and I foreign that's what God that's what God wants Kitty people that seek Him people that want his guidance Isa I'll be finishing up if Mr Gustavo can get ready Gustavo youth brother sister where is your heart tonight really in the depth of your heart examine yourself you know because Jesus is always knocking on your door on the door of your heart you know he's just there knocking and knocking and knocking and sometimes and sometimes we just peek through that door yeah and we talk and we tell Jesus Jesus you're not welcome but you know what Tenaya I want to dine with him I want to eat supper with him I want him to know that I am with him and then he is with me no matter what I go through God is with me you know just just like David as the Bible said there came a point where noticed that he could not do anything there's not a sickness there's not a child there's nothing that will stand against you but we must know where we're standing [Music] thank you [Applause] India God bless you is the first thing I'd like to say is that I love you [Music] truly you see a young man but as young as I am in age God has allowed me to go through certain things he's taught me one thing just simply telling somebody I love you with all your heart it makes the difference many times it's a privilege to be a part of a beautiful church people that have showed me so much love and giving me love as as though I was their their son since I truly don't deserve all the love that many of you have given me it's a privilege to be a part of this church amen a man after his own heart um foreign we had something that many people something many people try to fake but there's something that you can never fake and that's the love of God the devil cannot fake the love of God he can try but at the end of the day what he offers is always something temporary something that just lasts you maybe five or ten minutes maybe a day maybe a week but my God offers a type of love that takes me back to him give me give us back to my home back to where I belong and only his love can do that inside of me then through the meat in this dark cruel world a man after my own heart that was David and tonight that's what I want to point you and my brother Timothy wants to point you is the simple fact is that's what people have always seeked is something real is they want something that works okay the definition of influence the capacity to have an effect on the character development or behavior of someone or something or the effect itself it's all right if I preach about what we're living today that's why our beloved God gave us he gave us a message he gave us word of love so that we can go through this dark and evil hey and that's why like I said there's people called influencers nowadays um in India that I want to tell you something momentarily and then they say oh if you buy this it is and then they have videos of people saying videos oh my life has changed I've never been the same again but better even still with those videos there's still a doubt there's a doubt I will not do that there's still a doubt yeah because you yourself still haven't tested it hasn't it happened to you Holiness out of the 35 to an hour that you're on your phone that in that 30 to an hour that you're on your phone you see a video or something that pops up trying to sell you something and you think for a second is but I want to talk to you about someone of a character that never doubted and what he really had because it was the love that made him take the decisions that he made take the battles that no one else wanted to take the challenge to say how dare this uncircumcised Philistines defile the army of the Lord imagine yourself what's your size imagine you saw someone twice your size insulting your culture insulting your family not even Having the courage to say something back has that ever happened to someone but in a spiritual sense spiritual my question tonight and many times can I have this question is do I have enough of God inside of me and if I if I do worry his fruits he says because David bear fruits [Music] of challenging moments he poured out what he had inside of him because he knew what he had inside of him was real he didn't doubt it for one second but many times like I said right now there are influencers and in this time maybe there was influences as well when he came into the army of Israel those people influencing fear upon Him anger Maybe trying to make them like the rest but tonight again I know I'm not I'm not someone per se of a name but I'm not trying to be there but I'm going to try to point you to someone else that's my Lord Jesus Christ through my Prophet I'm going to show you what my Prophet says he says in the message to reject the king but it has it has never been in any age God's intention for his people to act like the people of this world or to be governed or control like the people of this world God's people always have been peculiar people and the love of God always makes you duplicate your things hold your tongue when you have maybe the right way to say things to them Love Takes control of you the love of God can only do that different people he says I'm gonna jump ahead it says their appetite for things Jesus and all that and all that their makeups is has been always contrary to the things that the people of this world desire Simplex what's your appetite when and I have trouble cuando tengo problemas why do I always look to my phone oh I go deep into my studies or go deep into my work try to clog up my mind [Music] try to clog up my time and try not to worry about that problem we're trying to find another source that will satisfied my momento and I take away the the problem [Music] a prophet talks about three types of Believers and many times I've aspects of which believer am I pregnant I want you to know what type of believer you are uh yes you'll be in here right now shows yourself and the world um they're not that common Christian Believers it's just going to church for routine there's something inside of you that's tickling away I'll go the introduce Texas even though you may dip your hat okay there's something still inside you're saying that ain't right and that's the love to your God yes the love that God placed in you before the foundation of the world he knew he were gonna need that because he knew what type of heart you were gonna have and he knew that it was a type of hearts that was gonna please him put a part of himself inside and the devil has always wanted to take that away from us take that and make it something normal but like David the love that he had for his God made him stand out the love that we have for our God through this world makes us look god um we were called to be oddballs in this dark and cruel age but I have a message I am one of them that has that part of God that doesn't let him stay still that even within my lowest moment yeah my darkest moments there's still something inside of me come back to me I'm still here the grace is still here I don't love you less I don't love you less when you make a message you didn't choose me to be a Christian when I was perfect he chose me when I was in my lowest he chose me when I was when the world wouldn't give it a scent for me this is what God chose you and me Nosotros s the message to reject the king in the men's it says he said there's some people they like to live through six days any way they want to it and go to church on Sunday morning and find an intellectual college graduate with a pleasant degree certificate that can speak a little sermon thanks be to God we're not that type of church we don't need a big old preaching we don't need much shouting that's what I want to believe that we have been brought a simple message that this world may say yes it can't be that simple I've said that before it can't be that simple but it is your three struggle with that because many times we feel like if we do something equally bad foreign [Music] [Music] true of Hearts is something that you want more I can't give it to you but we know who cares we've always known this the Simplicity of God the Simplicity of his forgiveness to make you doubt that foreign thus saith the Lord is for pure hearts it's your life sorry is an undefiled character who characters in Manchester for a different life A peculiar people a holy nation they'd rather consider with the world sorry coincide with the world and act like the world and go to some church that says that's all right just go just just act like the way you go on yes I know the devil is tried it many times but one thing that my pastor has shown me Pastor it makes me know that this God of ours is real may I say uh is there such a simple love an unconditional love a love that will make you not only recognize that you're wrong but I have the trust to want to come back the poder regressar if you please stand up she is again I'm not trying to excite no one no kiddo uh I'm not preaching anything we all know this we can call it ABC but why do we still struggle to Simply know forgiveness is right there for me love is an armed strength away but tonight I want you to know what type of heart you have um even though the devil has tried to smudge tried to take it away and try to mix it up with the whole world [Music] our Gods love uh has provided such a protection a fortress like when he said God says about job you can touch his body always belongs but just don't touch his heart that's the type of God we have he cares for us so much he loves us so much and it is so simple it overpasses us many of the times is [Music] that that God is for us is he knew what we were going to go through in this dark time and that's why the Bible says for God so loved the world foreign if there's any doubts you want to give your heart back to him and ask him to fill him up with that type of love [Music] that type of love that makes you trusted is [Music] that type of Love Is Egoista and think that you can do it on your own I've done it many times say you've been in church for so long yeah you still can't overcome this yeah uh tonight if you could tell that devil Diablo [Music] I forgotios and despite my condition despite my behavior despite all my flaws it pleased him before the foundation of this world to use me for his simple honor and glory to glory to Simply use someone like me to manifest the greatness of God foreign that was made by Love More please bow your heads let me see assembly father father you do as you please God who's there is [Music] many people say it's
