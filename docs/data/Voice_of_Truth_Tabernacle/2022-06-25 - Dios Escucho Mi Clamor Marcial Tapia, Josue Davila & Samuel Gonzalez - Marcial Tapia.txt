to the book of exodus chapter 3. man amen [Music] i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters verse eight says like this and i've come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land in a tierrace onto a land flowing with milk and honey verse 9. now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto you and i have also seen the oppression where with the egyptians oppress them uh you may be seated 25. matthew 16 25. okay let's read it for whosoever will save his life and whosoever will lose his life for my sister shall find it verse 26 says out of egypt [Applause] the only one [Applause] the way of [Music] i'm going to give a little bit about the story of moses how he came to this world the people of israel found themselves in differences they found themselves in slavery israel where the people of egypt took advantage of the people [Music] and there was a little couple that brother speaks about it was amram [Music] and joshua and i believe that there are couples we don't see i'm tired use us pirouette but god doesn't need you god bless you god bless you good to see you it's good to see you it's been a while you look good amen holy spirit we in ourselves can't do it no is on on living the crazy life in this world and acting as he pleases happiness that we're going to lose it we're going to lose our life [Music] they know your lives nermanos and look brothers i'm going to read this story and i'm going to be closing with this midi look i'm going to read it many and he was about to get married throughout the trip the man thought it'd be better if he took a different path of the one that he would take to to get to his promised ones and he decided to learn a new route that was more comfortable and that would promise new adventures going going on a path that they really didn't take him anywhere until one day he felt tired and the adventures have stopped being new and he despised the warmth of a home and so we decided to return however when he got there he found out that his promise so many years of not hearing about him she had thought he was dead the man regretting about the moment that he had taken the the opposite path and here's the let's run to god heard in slavery for 400 years with pain and sorrows a people that had possibly forgotten about the promises god had but there came the oppression of many um [Music] i want to share a testimony and i have three weeks with this same thought no matter how tranquilo and it hasn't left me still it hasn't left me alone [Music] and i thank god on the 20th of june of last i was in the wrong room [Music] [Music] yeah and what happened there was fulfilled part of the dream i was seated it appeared like if i was at a camp cristiano in a christian camp i said well what am i doing here and i would see a lot of youth and on my right side persona there was a person you may josue and they said to me josue josue you have to die you have to die [Applause] [Music] it doesn't matter [Music] a child of god [Music] foreign they began god don't leave us alone forgive us our freedom and if you came today you're looking for freedom a deliverance from something in my heart amen [Music] he gave them i believe in that [Music] and the reasons of their and i'm going to send you there ismo just as soon as he gets another out brother sister perot but he is here in your cry perhaps you possibly have a lot i don't want to return he's hundred thousand four hundred years of slavery until they began to cry to god it was a different kind of cry it's a different question that are crying for something more no i don't know what your situation is perhaps you're not coming to church i know [Music] i made profit god bless you brothers [Applause] god bless you you all look beautiful tonight if you may please stand if you could open your bibles to exodus chapter 3 verse 7 to 10. and it says like this see and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their onto a good land and enlarge onto a land flowing with milk and honey carlos now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is common to me jose is that me and i have also seen the oppression it my people the children of israel out of egypt amen you may take your seeds brothers god heard my cry is one of the greatest leaders in the bible you see he shows a great example of leadership you see when he freed the israelites from bondage israelites during those years you see moses wasn't always the same leader that he was vermouth when he freed the israelites no brother branham says that moses was keeping the flock of his father-in-law and it went to the back side of the mountain of horror and he spoke to him through a burning baby and god told moses moses i have brought you here because i have heard the clamor of my people in you see when moses heard the responsibility when moses heard the rules you see this is what most of us do these days i i am the one who makes the blind makes it blind makes the yo and the people so god tells moses anton says dios ladies someone says go there because i will do wonders in egypt and moses says what if they don't believe me god promised moses but he was going to be with him you see it a what does it matter to me who your god is important double the and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with you see because of pharaoh por causa del faragon put in more more uh more burden on the people of israel this led to the people of israel feeling oppressed the people estoy every morning every night moses didn't stop going to pharaoh he says although the israelites didn't care moses didn't lock himself in a room vamoy says no sense and said all these people do not do not support me [Applause] you know the point that shocks me the most about moses's story is that god knows who he chooses how many believe that tonight care about the opinions of this world again god said it and what is about god is going to be what i need to clarify something okay no this life is not easy let's not be that nice fascinating we gotta stop playing church brothers it's not easy not everyone will believe in us not everyone is gonna give us a pat on the shoulder saying well done this life is easy this life is not easy established people will think that you're crazy but that does not give us the license tie ourselves up to tie ourselves to hide ourselves no brothers god spoke with us because the kind of relationship that you have with god because we are so attached to the keys of this world and instead of accepting what god has for us we start making up excuses why do we start making up excuses and they were put in a certain position where it looked impossible where it looked a little difficult you see in front of them what's the red sea established the south and because that is you see god wanted to bring moses to the red sea because while the israelites were going to die god was going to manifest this power support moses and it says like this this i see god said stand on your feet moses go speak to the children of israel that they go forward never does god ever say retreat there's no retreat in god no matter what stage of the battle you're in if you've i'm afraid about the baptism of the holy spirit and go forward don't come back there's nothing about god god is always going forward just keep moving forward moses was different the egyptians beating up the hebrews was because he didn't have that holy spirit and that's how we are brothers well we don't have that holy spirit we make so many mistakes we fell in so many places where we certified [Music] they might have been free physically but they were not free spiritually you see they wanted to do things in their own ways and because of them they had to suffer don't think that going to church on wednesdays fridays and sundays is going to save you no piece of domingo brothers we need the holy spirit we need him you see god can free us from the oppression of you just that oppression cannot hold us [Music] and that is how many believe that god is here tonight how many believe that the lord jesus christ you see it maybe you might be in chains right now by the enemy those any oppression of the enemy they will make a way well there is no way oh i will come he will make a way if you want to be free tonight tonight is your opportunity [Music] [Music] the altar is open
