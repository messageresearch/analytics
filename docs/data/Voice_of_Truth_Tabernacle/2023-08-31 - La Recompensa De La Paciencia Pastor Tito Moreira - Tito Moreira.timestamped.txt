[19:45] amen
[19:47] says
[19:49] that Shield every day
[19:52] every day the devil is attacking us
[19:56] [Music]
[19:59] Revelation 3
[20:02] says first
[20:08] Revelations 3 verse
[20:13] the last preaching on the Sardis Church
[20:22] the end of this summary
[20:25] and we're speaking about the reward
[20:28] patience
[20:30] Blancas
[20:36] de la vida is
[20:43] you that overcometh the same shall be
[20:46] clothed in white Raymond and I will not
[20:47] blot out his name out of the book of
[20:49] life but I will confess his name before
[20:51] my father and before his angels
[20:58] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[21:00] the church let us pray Heavenly Father
[21:07] be the bomb that we need in this is
[21:12] surely some of us are wounded and hurts
[21:20] wounds from the battles
[21:30] so keep looking forward
[21:33] and know that we are not pero Pronto
[21:36] Pronto but soon Lord yeah
[21:48] may be seated
[22:01] [Music]
[22:13] [Music]
[22:38] not how much you pay the Catholic church
[22:45] it's not about how much you do to come
[22:47] out of the Purgatory
[22:51] to Chris so faith that you have in the
[22:53] Lord Jesus Christ
[22:55] it's not about how many years you have
[22:57] insurance
[22:58] or how much message you've read
[23:01] how much Bible you've memorized it's
[23:04] about your faith it's what you believe
[23:08] that gives you your salvation
[23:12] that was Luther's message
[23:15] that's what he
[23:18] preachedification a message of
[23:20] justification crucification
[23:21] justification
[23:23] the first stage
[23:28] so getting to the news
[23:30] the stage of water
[23:33] the stage
[23:36] where we make a lot of mistakes
[23:41] because we continue making mistakes
[23:49] we still need is
[25:06] he wants to have
[25:08] get it and when he wants Mandara
[25:13] like in Noah's day
[25:17] wants to give the promises
[25:25] if we can have patience with God
[25:29] patience with our brothers
[25:34] we will have a room
[25:43] some tell about the future
[25:48] I believe God's word is not just about
[25:51] the future
[25:52] I believe we can apply to it
[25:55] today
[25:59] yesterday today and forever
[26:02] we have in the future
[26:05] that's the type of God we have today is
[26:08] and he says he that overcomes
[26:13] he that is patience
[26:15] that overcomes
[26:21] those tough moments
[26:25] the same shall be clothed in Hawaii
[26:27] Raymond
[26:30] and I will now blot out his name of the
[26:32] book of life
[26:36] I will focus on this other thing
[26:40] but I will confess his name before my
[26:43] father
[26:45] now this phrase
[26:50] sounds similar to other scriptures in
[26:53] the Bible
[26:54] and Revelation actually
[27:00] refers to different scriptures in
[27:03] different passages
[27:06] and one of those scriptures is in yes
[27:16] Matthew chapter 10 verse 32
[27:24] Matthew 10 32.
[27:28] IES
[27:36] whosoever therefore shall confess me
[27:38] before men him will I confess also
[27:40] before my Father which is in heaven
[27:43] that sounds very similar hello
[27:46] and then verse 33 says
[27:55] whosoever shall deny me before man him
[27:58] will I also deny before my Father which
[28:01] is in heaven
[28:05] if we do not place them in the right
[28:09] I think we can confuse ourselves a
[28:11] little uh
[28:13] we could think
[28:17] when it says he that confesses me before
[28:20] men
[28:20] [Music]
[28:24] you might say well what does that mean
[28:26] to confess before man significance
[28:29] simply mean to say I'm a Christian
[28:32] significa Jesus
[28:35] I mean Jesus saves me significa Jesus
[28:39] does it mean to say what Jesus says
[28:42] confess what he said
[28:46] what does it
[28:48] means him before men
[28:51] and the next question is
[28:54] what does it mean to deny him before
[28:58] doesn't mean to make a mistake significa
[29:02] doesn't mean to say something against
[29:05] him
[29:08] I think there's a very known story on
[29:12] Peter Pedro
[29:14] denied the Lord Jesus Christ
[29:19] if we take the scripture of denying him
[29:22] literally and don't says
[29:26] Peter is a perfect example of someone
[29:31] and if that's the way Jesus Jesus
[29:35] should deny him
[29:37] he says it says Matthew 26.
[29:58] came unto him saying thou also was with
[30:01] Jesus of Galilee
[30:04] notice the picture here Jesus
[30:07] uh
[30:17] juicio he was taken to judgment
[30:20] [Applause]
[30:22] and near there is Peter Pedro Peter
[30:28] will never or deny you
[30:31] mean
[30:33] I'll give my own life for you
[30:39] slice an ear off a soldier Pedro Peters
[30:45] apparently so brave
[30:51] was so close
[30:56] when Jesus was being judged
[31:00] and outside in the palace was Peter yes
[31:08] now also was with Jesus
[31:11] you are one of them
[31:28] how horrible
[31:33] and when he was gone out into the porch
[31:36] another made song
[31:38] and said unto them that were there
[31:42] this fellow was also with Jesus of
[31:45] Nazareth
[31:53] and again he's a knight with an
[31:57] he promised it
[31:59] that's tremendous
[32:04] if this is not worthy of Jesus denying
[32:07] him I don't know what else is
[32:10] he promised
[32:13] he had no business with him
[32:16] how horrible how horrible to here
[32:25] Peter say I don't know this man
[32:30] foreign
[33:23] oh
[33:32] 74 73 and after a while came up to him
[33:36] they sat stood by and said Peter surely
[33:38] thou also are one of them for thy speech
[33:41] be wraith thee and
[33:46] and then he
[33:48] then began he took courage
[33:51] what did Peter
[33:55] says that he cursed and swore
[33:59] for the third time
[34:03] his Lord his God
[34:30] make him seem so dirty that he couldn't
[34:32] be with Jesus
[34:35] what did he say
[34:37] s
[34:38] you can just imagine I'm sure
[34:49] saying I know not the man and
[34:51] immediately the car crew
[34:58] and then it says that Peter went and
[35:00] webbed bitterly
[35:03] now
[35:05] I ask you has anyone done something like
[35:08] that
[35:11] we've complained
[35:15] so terrible like Peter
[35:20] yeah
[35:23] a bunch of Hypocrites
[35:30] be no Pastor I've never heard anyone
[35:32] deny Jesus like Peter did
[35:50] there was something that he deserved
[35:53] [Music]
[35:56] Jesus
[36:00] if someone deserves to be denied by
[36:03] Jesus this would be the example
[36:06] this would be the case
[36:12] he should be the person Jesus denies
[36:17] nevertheless we know the stories
[36:19] that after the resurrection Jesus
[36:23] Jesus looks for Peter himself right
[36:29] looks for Peter himself
[36:32] do you love me
[36:40] what Peter had done Peter do you love it
[36:45] feel my flock
[36:49] and those
[36:52] so what of the scriptures if they denied
[36:56] me
[36:59] Matthew 10 says anyone that denies meant
[37:03] before men
[37:06] okay or they're Peter
[37:11] Peter qualifies
[37:15] I will also deny him before my Father
[37:17] which is in heaven
[37:40] with Peter
[37:43] amen amen Mateo Diaz Matthew 10.
[37:49] now we read from verse
[37:54] however therefore shall confess
[38:03] let's read before the entire chapter
[38:06] it says
[38:43] these 12 Jesus and forth and commanded
[38:46] them saying
[38:49] now the first we read
[38:53] the one that says if anyone confessed me
[38:56] before man is
[38:58] part of these instructions
[39:24] saying the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[39:44] in foreign
[40:46] for they will deliver you up to the
[40:49] councils and they will Scorch you in
[40:51] their synagogues
[40:57] verse 19 but when they deliver you up
[41:00] take no thought how or what you shall
[41:02] speak
[41:03] verse
[41:12] and the brothers shall deliver up the
[41:14] brother to death and the Father the
[41:16] child and the children shall rise up
[41:17] against their parents and cause them to
[41:19] be put to death
[41:20] notice what Jesus does he's preparing
[42:25] don't matter so much foreign
[43:27] now we're getting closer to
[43:36] are not Two Sparrows sold for a farthing
[43:39] and one of them shall not fall on the
[43:41] ground without your
[43:43] fathers
[43:45] but the very hairs of your head are all
[43:48] numbers
[43:50] it's like Jesus is giving them
[43:52] confidence
[44:06] they're going to kick you out
[44:09] [Music]
[44:10] don't be afraid of them
[44:15] for your father is watching you know
[44:19] so 31 says
[44:24] you are of more value than many sparrows
[44:28] that's 31.
[44:34] Grande
[45:34] I think it's a bigger challenge
[45:36] to say that you're satanic
[45:39] and you worship
[45:42] than to say you're Christians
[45:46] yeah
[45:49] right
[45:52] there's no dangerous
[46:00] but there's no danger
[46:03] Jesus is speaking
[46:07] after coming in today
[46:10] before he tells them
[46:15] whosoever confessed me before men
[46:20] before he says these words
[46:31] but they're not alone
[46:33] foreign
[47:22] think a little on job
[47:26] remember job now
[47:30] remember adios the offer saying gave God
[47:36] saying comes to God and tells him
[47:44] the reason job praises
[47:50] the reason why job is happy to confess
[47:58] the reason why it's easy for him to come
[48:01] to church
[48:04] and sing to you
[48:06] and speak about you is
[48:09] because you have them well protected
[48:13] well protected
[48:17] but give them to me for a moment
[48:20] give him to me for a moment
[48:24] and we'll see if he denies your name is
[48:57] this is where he would prove to stand
[49:00] for God or not
[49:03] and I believe every Son of God has to be
[49:05] tested
[49:07] it's in the times of the trials
[49:13] we will show if we're going to stand for
[49:15] God or if we won't
[49:19] easy to say we all love Christ
[49:24] it's easy to say we love Christ
[49:27] just let the devil take everything away
[49:35] to go against you
[49:39] nothing goes against you yes
[49:43] [Applause]
[49:57] your retreat there
[51:02] your name
[51:04] I hope to job
[51:07] his work was taken away
[51:11] his income or earnings were taken
[51:15] his children were taken away
[51:17] his family was taken
[51:20] Health was taken away and the Bible says
[51:24] specifically says
[51:39] the last verse and all this job sin not
[51:42] nor charge God foolishly
[51:45] and all this is
[51:51] nor charge God foolishly
[51:54] how tremendous
[51:59] I'm going to tell you something
[52:49] love you
[53:28] those confessions
[53:36] all of eternity
[53:42] I believe that God
[53:47] is
[53:48] confession writes those confessions
[53:56] Paul
[54:01] Pablo
[54:02] Timothy
[54:08] 4 9.
[54:10] second Timothy 4 9. he was in prison
[54:15] thought he was going to die
[54:20] he didn't die in that place but he
[54:23] thought he was going to is
[54:29] and what he thought were his last
[54:31] letters to Timothy
[54:34] he wrote what he thought were his last
[54:36] name he was in prison
[54:41] it says to thy diligence to come shortly
[54:45] unto me
[54:50] how lonely did Paul feel
[54:53] Paras
[54:55] to ask Timothy to come see him
[55:00] for Dimas hath forsaken Amanda
[55:05] issalonica having loved this present
[55:08] world and is departed unto thessalonica
[55:24] only Luke is with me this is
[55:34] me for this ministry then verse 14 says
[55:36] Alejandro calderero
[55:42] Alexander the coppersmith did me much
[55:45] evil
[55:48] verse 16.
[55:52] my first answer
[55:54] the
[55:59] Primera when I try to plea my case
[56:03] because he went to court
[56:07] he was being accused
[56:10] he says in my at my first answer
[56:15] no man stood with me
[56:19] but all men forsook me
[56:26] well verse 17 says
[56:31] now withstanding the Lord stood with me
[56:36] this is what it's about
[56:42] the Lord stood with me
[56:46] is
[56:54] the Lord stood with me
[56:58] when everyone has criticized
[57:09] and strengthened me
[57:14] the preaching
[57:17] and that all the Gentiles
[57:21] and I was delivered out of the mouth of
[57:24] the Lion
[58:23] they will not
[58:36] on him
[58:39] velocity
[59:55] you deliver me from this situation
[1:00:09] for we were not Brethren no queremos
[1:00:12] King no race have you ignorance
[1:00:15] of our trouble
[1:00:18] which came to us in Asia
[1:00:22] that we were oppressed
[1:00:28] and what we read it and we say well
[1:00:30] glory to God for Paulo
[1:00:36] he wanted to make sure it was written
[1:00:41] God wanted to make sure it was written
[1:00:48] we were pressed out of measure above
[1:00:51] strength
[1:00:54] oh
[1:00:57] was so great
[1:01:00] that my strength would not were not
[1:01:02] enough
[1:01:06] have you ever felt that way
[1:01:10] the trial is so tough
[1:01:13] this is
[1:01:16] above strength you've been looking
[1:01:19] foreign
[1:03:33] he will do it foreign
[1:04:10] algunos
[1:04:12] de Nosotros some of us
[1:04:19] Dolores indescribles we'll have to go
[1:04:22] through Indescribable pain
[1:04:27] the religious
[1:04:30] but the fact that you still stand with
[1:04:33] Christ in mediator
[1:04:36] in the midst of everything is
[1:04:41] the greatest confession you can have
[1:04:53] foreign not complaining no
[1:04:58] no
[1:05:01] not letting go of the plow
[1:05:05] preparation but standing beside God
[1:05:12] sometimes we say Lord how can I stand
[1:05:15] beside you the way I am
[1:05:20] how Lord
[1:05:24] Pedro there was Peter
[1:05:27] come up
[1:05:29] how can I stand with you Lord
[1:05:36] how can I stand with you
[1:05:40] but Jesus knew
[1:05:43] Peter will stand for him
[1:05:47] Jesus
[1:05:49] knew although he messed up
[1:05:57] will not stay down forever
[1:06:01] we all know the story
[1:06:10] at the end of Peter's life
[1:06:15] says that he was fleeing from Jerusalem
[1:06:21] and while he was fleeing
[1:06:26] he saw Jesus in a vision
[1:06:33] and Jesus was going the opposite way
[1:06:36] Peter was
[1:06:39] Jesus
[1:06:41] was going to Jerusalem
[1:06:46] Peter says Jesus where are you going
[1:06:52] Jesus says to be crucified again
[1:06:57] Peter understood
[1:07:02] that it was his job
[1:07:07] to take that place for Jesus this is
[1:07:15] and face the ones that were looking for
[1:07:18] him
[1:07:22] and he stood up for Jesus
[1:07:26] I'm not worthy they said crucified so be
[1:07:31] crucified like my Lord crucified
[1:07:34] crucify me upside down
[1:07:39] Pedro
[1:07:41] and Peter was crucified upside down
[1:07:46] here stood up for the Lord
[1:07:49] Jesus Peter confessed Jesus
[1:07:54] while they crucified him
[1:07:57] he said he is my lord for me he stood up
[1:08:02] for me
[1:08:03] I'll stand for him
[1:08:09] when you stand for him
[1:08:11] Jesus says
[1:08:14] I will not blow out your name
[1:08:21] he will have reasons to blot out my name
[1:08:27] is
[1:08:28] I believe he has many of them
[1:08:35] how many can say the same
[1:08:39] he's got reasons to blot out my name
[1:08:44] but if you stand for him
[1:08:48] if you
[1:08:52] believe in him despite everything
[1:08:59] if your life still says God I love you
[1:09:05] in the midst of tribulation Jesus Jesus
[1:09:09] says
[1:09:10] I will now blot out your name
[1:09:14] I believe when he says I will not blot
[1:09:17] out your name
[1:09:19] what I understand
[1:09:22] is
[1:09:23] that he could blot out my name
[1:09:29] that I've done enough for my name to be
[1:09:32] bloody
[1:09:33] but because
[1:09:40] I'll stand for you
[1:09:47] your name
[1:09:51] although you're like Peter
[1:09:54] because I know that you love me
[1:10:01] musicians can come
[1:10:08] he said
[1:10:13] Revelation 3 5 says
[1:10:17] he's not overcometh the same shall be
[1:10:20] clothed in white Rain Man
[1:10:24] and I will not blot out his name out of
[1:10:27] the book of life
[1:10:31] but I will confess his name before my
[1:10:34] father is
[1:10:35] and before his angels
[1:10:49] whosoever therefore shall confess me
[1:10:51] before men
[1:10:56] I confess also before my Father which is
[1:10:58] in heaven
[1:11:03] I know you can think about the future
[1:11:10] but brother Brown says that God is
[1:11:12] interceding for us
[1:11:14] the Bible says that Jesus is
[1:11:20] between us and God
[1:11:24] and brother Branham says
[1:11:28] whenever you confess something
[1:11:31] Jesus
[1:11:33] says Jesus confesses that to the father
[1:11:38] you could okay I believe that in those
[1:11:41] moments
[1:11:44] Jesus spoke with his disciples
[1:11:47] he was telling them
[1:11:50] you will go through a lot
[1:11:54] status
[1:11:56] is
[1:11:59] deliver you up
[1:12:02] moment you will go through tough times
[1:12:08] but confess me there
[1:12:12] confess that I am your lord
[1:12:16] and I will confess
[1:12:19] before my father
[1:12:21] and before my angels and I imagine
[1:12:26] Jesus saying
[1:12:33] now you'll help them
[1:12:38] Angeles Angels
[1:12:41] Go Aid my son
[1:12:44] give them strength give them courage
[1:12:48] tell them they'll make it
[1:12:52] give them the strength they don't have
[1:13:02] here please stand
[1:13:13] give him the mercy Jesus I see Jesus
[1:13:20] saying father
[1:13:36] extend your mercy oh brother
