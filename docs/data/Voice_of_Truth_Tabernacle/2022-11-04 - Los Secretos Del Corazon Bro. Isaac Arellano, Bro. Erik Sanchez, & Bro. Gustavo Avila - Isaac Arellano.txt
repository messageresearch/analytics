the house of God want to greet everyone watching through the internet internet and we're happy that God has allowed us to be here one more night amen yes at the end of the week we can come and worship God and thank him for giving us the strength gracias hey man I hope you're all doing good our title for this night is the secrets of the heart is Los secretos and we'll be reading there in judges 14 14. and when you have you can say Amen and I'm gonna be focusing if you know what we're gonna read it's a riddleston Enigma and riddles have a lot of meanings significados but I want to focus on one of them and the scripture of God reads and he said unto them out of the ear came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness and they could not in three days expound the riddle is bow our heads and let us pray Heavenly Father pares take over my mind over my lips or may only you be speaking and may you also be with my brother Fidel and my brother Eric Glory and Honor be for you glorious amen Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may be seated uh we've heard our brothers already preach on Samson yeah we heard our brother Enoch we heard our brother Hector our brother blast and they all share how they relate to Samson and I also identify with Samson the same way they did I know they went after something they were not supposed to see and so I don't repeat my story I'm sure you all know it already and it's very similar yes but I want to focus on this riddle tonight now in this story of Samson is about victory Victoria and victimhood the we see that Samson is victorious victorious killing 1 000 Philistines he's tough and strong and that's only one side of his life just like we can be only tough and strong on one side of our life is Samson's story is about strength an embarrassing weakness from Force does that sound like anyone's life that's how I've been sometimes I've been up Estados and I've been down amen amen now we've been in the gospel long enough or maybe in the message long enough to know that we can walk in victory Victoria in one area of our lives and another area of Our Lives you could have victory in church Victorian like let's be a victim in your home you know uh TD Jake said TD Jakes dijo you can have a PhD on a and have credit so bad that you can't even pay attention can can this attention amen little little comical for you credit is so bad you can't pay attention brother I don't know how to translate amen but it's amazing how Samsung is strong enough to defeat a Philistines with a Jawbone but he couldn't put up with a crying woman for seven days and that was just Samsung's case what is our case there's sides of us that are also vulnerable okay the Devil beats us foreign system the scripture says that he came under the spirit of the Lord when he defeated the lion but on his way back the spirit of the Lord was not with him so he touched that dead body now Samson did this is after he was filled with the Holy Spirit and this just shows yes that an outpouring of the Holy Ghost not automatically makes a person godlier I'm gonna repeat it and outpouring of the Holy Spirit and a person can be wonderfully gifted by the Holy Spirit In other words the Holy Spirit can come over someone and after so be spiritually immature spiritual do we understand that he was filled with the Holy Spirit and he just proved it provoked that he was immature to his vowelto amen amen now I want you to think about all the lions that have tried to kill you because Samsung was on his way to a wedding and who's ever gotten married here on your way you don't think to fight a lion he is nobody thinks the father lying going to get married amen but here this lion did it wait for Samson to be ready just like the devil is not waiting for us to be ready you know the Lions have tried to kill us in our lives the line of depression the line of grief of fear of death the more of Trouble they and you don't fight so you don't plan to fight on your way to get married amen amen that's why we say porreso de simos when when somebody says why are you like this why why are you so defensive defensivo and this and and they say yes that's that's why I got scars on my heart because the line jumped out that's why I overreact but says because a lion jumped out that's why I'm so offended because a line jumped out there's some people in this room that don't understand the way they are sometimes I don't understand the way I am because so many lions have jumped at me out of nowhere when when always people forgive me we're always I don't know if you if this is you you know but we go about our lives ready to throw down you know we're ready we're half locked and loaded all the time yeah we're we're always looking we're always looking behind our shoulder uh we're walking in the trees in the bushes waiting for the next lion to jump out Esperanto cuando you know and and that's how we that's that's that's not good yes correct to always be watching your back and I want to leave that up to God Amen so yes I'm in I wanna I wanna point something out and I'm closing already that killing a lion empty-handed is no easy thing but killing a lion can be done is he was bare-handed he didn't have nothing in his hands God is going to give us the victory against our lion La Victorian Contra and Western tell your neighbor I'm gonna do it bare-handed we cannot be laid-back people no problemos who let the lion come in and destroy us destroy our youth this through youngest to his Holiness even our elders sometimes our elders are going at it the devil's coming against all of us bare-handed Warriors somos Guerreros but so bare-handed Warriors Guerreros is what God wants you know you don't need a lot in your hands you don't need the advantages that your brother has the spirit of God to come in and Samsung did it with his bare hands even though the odds are against us we need to fight back even if their teeth are bigger even if their claws are longer fight back to the youth you need to fight back insecure because because if you don't fight back it's gonna kill you and you'll be dead for a while until you start fighting back again fight it back or it'll kill you because the answer to this riddle respuesta is that the bigger the fight is the sweeter the honey bad mazdul say is the bigger the fight the stronger the fights the stronger the trials you know go back to the place that almost killed you go back to that place I almost left you for dead and take that honey from there [Applause] God bless you [Applause] thank you Hermanos very tremendous message from our brother Isaac is now if you can follow me to the Book of Judges chapter 16. we're going to be reading verses 15 and 16. this is 17. what's this disease Judges chapter 16 15 17. and she said unto him how can thou say I love thee when thine heart is not with me thus mock me these three times and has not told me we're in thy great strength life hijo es foreign there hath not come a razor upon my head for I have been a Nazarite unto God for my mother's womb if I be shaving then my strength will go for me and I shall become weak and be like any other man in a second scripture in Deuteronomy chapter 29 verse 29. Deuteronomy 29 29. Australia Nosotros is the secret things belong unto the Lord Our God but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the work the words of this law amen the blessings the secrets of the heart and look it's a secret is very important Isaac our brother Isaac with this scripture about this riddle to his first wife and it would later cost Sampson to go and get 30 linen garments and 30 of feast outfits or garments I would have liked to have been born in a home that had advantages to be born in home with advantages is to have a loving father a mother that shows a lot of affection grandparents that love you and possible economic opportunities perhaps a good home a house you know they say and one says or you say I didn't have all that but even even uh even besides all that I want to I'm still here standing in La Vida in life in the life of this man named Samson he had a very home with a lot of advantages he had all the love from his parents economically I imagine he didn't like anything a good example of parents spiritually an exceptional pair of parents that were connected to God and look apart from all that Samson was a was a son that was a desired child because his mother his mother was sterile she couldn't have children so I imagine that when she receives the news that she was going to be a mother how happy that woman must have became to the degree that she desire the moment for Samson to be born as our Pastor said last Friday was a very privileged man and not only that spiritual but in the spiritual dios God Elijah God chooses from his birth and he sets him apart for his service he sets him apart away in a special way to the point that he's a Nazarene from his birth right now look everything was going well Sanson Sampson said he made any kind of error differences he got involved with different women he got close to a dead body or a dead a carcass and he he lied but even then God was with him God was with him the secret that God had given him that no no razor no knife could come across the locks of his hair and that's where God up to a certain point abandons him he revealed because he opened up his heart to the wrong person he reveals secrets to them that are for yourself they're personal to the first person you meet in downtown Alex dios God reveals secrets to his children God doesn't reveal his secrets to the whole world look even the disciples they ask the Lord Jesus Christ why do you speak to us in Parables the Lord responded to them because you it's made known to you the the Mysteries and it's not given to them do you see look I want to get to this point this is what I'm getting at secretos or God looks at who he shares his secrets with dios God is careful of who he shares the secrets with look a young Kinesis in Genesis he told the woman in the serpentine between your seat and her seat she her Offspring will bruise your head [Music] in other words a messiah and the devil was waiting for him but he didn't know exactly how it was going to come but that right when the Lord Jesus when they crucify him the devil wasn't sure if it was him or if it wasn't him people beat you you do nothing he didn't know for certain that if it was yeah he thought that he was just another prophet the Lord Jesus Goes to Hell the devil tells him he tells him I thought I had you when I killed Adam when I killed Moses but look here you are now that he was God himself is the mystery of God revealed do you see how God hides things to other types of people but to his children he reveals it to them when he says that woman at the well you're the son of the Living God he only reveals it to his children look youth yes reveals he's in his word and when God reveals something to you keep it in your heart don't just share it to anyone you know in a simple way s that's how you cut your hair don't listen to him just keep walking with God look Enoch walks so much with God to the point that when he least realized he was already with God Brothers to the point that he didn't want to return again that is how it is keep walking with God lines can rise up against you to leave the place to my brother aura is absolutely is absolutely absolutely now if he is our absolute there can be no other app so you can have say well my church is my absolute my Creed is my absolutely if Christ is your absolute you believe Christ's word there's no other way to do it you know I think about the time that he saved me I'll tell you why I stand the way I do not to be different I made myself clear on that I hope I have why when Christ saved me there were millions of people groping in sin us when he saved me he had a purpose in doing it he had a purpose like me and somehow or another intelligentes when there was plenty of smart men Hombres Mas capacities more able to do it me here with not even a hardly a seventh grade education when there was men who studied in school and got degrees and doctors of divinity and philosophy and so forth safe I love you and you know that but I'm determining my heart that I'll never back on that one I'll stay right there this is foreign but to be honest and sincere with God look if somebody's going to bind you let it be to have things there is nothing that you can get out of he was a set apart from God I believe that God has something for you you are the future keep walking with God don't allow the world God bless you Brothers [Applause] it's beautiful how God works even when not knowing what my brother Isaac was going to preach about without knowing and yeah I can feel that God having control of all things the secrets of our hearts Los secretos you know the riddle saving like nigma the secret is and then all those two things what I bring tonight all fall in the lines of being placed in the heart the circles if you can take something from all three of us is God simply wants the most intimate part of you and the most intimate part of you can only be found inside your heart because in itself what can see it takes a lot of strengtha to to reveal yourself to give someone else the most intimate part of you you're allowing someone else to know things about you and no one else knows and you're you find yourself in your most vulnerable state and this is where Samsung found himself in that verse chapter 16 verse 18 and that's the verse where he opens his heart to Delilah and as many young people the young man Hombres many times a young lady comes into your life vice versa young ladies a young man comes into your life and you want to say you know what love is but when you come to know God's love the love that you feel in his body the love that you feel in his body does not compare it's a different type of love and the only way you can get to know about that love is when you can give your heart first to God and not do what Samson did in this case give his heart to someone else that he wanted to trust believing but the only person we can come to believe in and trust him again I've seen in my life brothers and sisters have seen it in their lives the only person you can be vulnerable with I know that they're not going to turn your back they're back on you is Dios because there is a huge difference between doing something foreign it's something that it's not for yourself it's for someone else brother Brandon says God's love God's love is the beginning of all love what makes you do things and when the church can get in the real love he says in the love of God in their hearts doing things ashamed how many have been a shades yeah it's happened to me it's come to me before but the reason is because there's a lack of love there's a lack of God inside of me but when that love of God can come inside it doesn't matter how sweet the voice is doesn't matter how much the devil presses in that line that comes against you gravity sometimes one more time it makes you like gravity that just makes people go towards you be pulled towards personas it's like brother Brandon says the world America was just wanting a little bit of love Godly type of blessings and like many of us to avoid many of the problems that we find ourselves if we could have foreign but yet God has a purpose to all things but the only way we know that purpose of that purpose is the most intimate places with God because the devil has always tried to take what belongs to God says in the message where thy strength where has thy strength gone Samson it says but in the Garden of Eden the devil chose the man's hair and now the Devil comes into the intellectual Diablo entrance and has brought his religion to intellectual he says you know you'll never know God intellectually you say this [Music] nothing can be taken away from him he's always wanted to take God's Throne were designed and what is designed for God's dwelling place as much as the devil who tries to fit in there [Music] you're not 100 sure you can find your your heart but when you can find yourself placed in God's hands foreign compared to God's love comparable so I love about this world offers again like my brothers if you could take anything I'm trying to just trying to make sure I'm not trying to waste no more time but ask yourself tonight am I putting my heart in the right place where I'm going is my heart in it what I'm doing for God is my heart in it many times you find ourselves like Samsung we give our our body instead of our hearts where it's supposed to be the opposite God has always wanted to deal with a person's Hearts Jesus what is the greatest of The Commandments he said You shall love your God with all your heart foreign Eva but many but again God knows all things God knows why you go through things he wants to show you something like a brother Eric said there was a reason there's a lot of better people than us I'm muchas personas are a lot more devoted people than us worthy of God's Grace trying to be like the world cry cry out wholeheartedly that's when many times we lack as long as says it's a lack of sincerity and there's a sturdist sincerity that God requires I don't know what's going on tonight I don't know how God wants to move right now but if tonight you could do what you're not used to doing and be vulnerable be vulnerable with God right now I'm telling you again he's never going to turn your back on you he's never going to make fun of you how you phrase them how you sing to him he loves it when you do that he loves to see you when when you're being the real but only in the love of God and that secret place can God be with you if you could please stand foreign foreign dying in her mother's arms seeing her suffer Miranda and him crying with all his heart God please don't take my little girl please don't take my little girl the things he loved the most the thing that took his heart but then later on a brother comes to brother Branham and he asks them the questions after God took your little girl and your wife away how do you feel towards God do you still love him after he took everything from you and then our Prophet turns and says I love him with all my life I love him with all my heart I could be alone physically I can be an audible thank you Father but because I gave my heart to God because I let them enter into not only my living room not only it's in the kitchen to the bedroom of my heart oh that love I have towards him makes me do and say things that it's out of My Own Strength I know it's no longer I know it's no longer me doing it by the power of his love me that helps me do it [Music] the prophet says before praying with your heads bowed concertos I would like to ask you this question as your brother and who loves you only says these things not to come and and Pat you know but to make sure that you're right with God how many would like to have that experience they once had experience a renewing in the spirit pray for me right now that God renew my strengths God renew my strength Joseph all things of this world all the cleave and cleave to thee Donald he will not he that will not forsake all and take up his cross daily Elke
