[28:52] this is jeremiah
[29:51] to the people of israel
[30:06] who jeremiah is
[30:10] the prophet of god
[30:16] that was born around 650 ac emory
[30:33] okay
[30:50] there were three exiles of the children
[30:52] of israel avadonia to babylon
[30:57] there were three exiles la primera
[30:59] deportacion first exile fueno
[31:02] approximately
[31:05] took place approximately in the year 605
[31:08] ac enessa salida and in that and that
[31:10] certain uh exit cuando e este hombre
[31:15] he wasn't yet a king ncl
[31:43] want you to get the best of the best of
[31:45] jerusalem es afuela primera and that was
[31:47] a seperate
[31:49] deportation
[31:52] that was done
[31:54] jerusalem went to jerusalem
[31:57] he went and grabbed danny
[32:27] and daniel's approximately 12 to 50
[32:29] years old juan does
[32:31] babylonia he's taken to babylon
[32:34] are you following me
[32:37] on the second exile the second
[32:38] deportation second exile fuelling
[33:17] in the books of chronicles in the second
[33:19] kings
[35:13] where did abraham come from ur de los
[35:16] calderos
[35:28] of babel and it's
[36:10] [Applause]
[36:52] later in questions and answers
[36:56] ezekiel was a prophet and a priest
[37:01] he was born in the in the year six
[37:03] twenty two aces
[37:08] and he died in 571 ac
[37:12] now there are three things we have to
[37:13] notice
[37:17] there's jeremiah who's still alive and
[37:20] jerusalem in
[37:56] and jeremiah is still alive in jerusalem
[38:01] seeing everything that's going on with
[38:02] these people
[38:06] [Music]
[38:13] that was in the year 587 ac
[38:15] d
[38:44] that the only thing that was left was
[38:46] the poor farmers

[38:50] jeremiah never went to babylon
[38:52] in jerusalem
[38:53] in jerusalem and dies there

[39:53] foreign
[40:12] [Music]
[40:22] even then god
[40:34] is
[40:50] it doesn't
[41:32] i want to take you to where daniel was
[41:34] taken to babylon
[41:37] this is very interesting brothers estos
[41:40] vivid this is bible
[41:43] daniel
[41:46] aspenas
[41:59] that he should bring certain of the
[42:00] children of israel and of the king seed
[42:02] and other princes
[42:11] when nebuchadnezzar goes and brings the
[42:12] best of the best okay

[43:06] king's palace
[43:08] listen escuche listen
[43:25] next slide
[43:27] cuales el proposito de babylonia what is
[43:29] the purpose of babylon
[44:05] a new way to worship
[44:19] their identity
[44:48] worship
[45:02] is
[45:52] [Music]
[45:58] who they
[46:01] [Music]
[46:12] babylon
[46:26] it's a spirit that's more free oh
[46:28] no
[46:30] you don't have to dress this way
[46:32] you can also worship your god
[46:37] it presents to you differently
[46:40] he changes your
[46:48] [Music]
[47:12] [Music]
[47:36] brother sister
[48:01] and i will be your king your god
[48:31] it's because i just want him to get to
[48:32] the point so i can yell.
[48:43] when i begin to shout they lose the
[48:45] point
[49:24] there are two things that i want to i
[49:25] want to highlight
[49:27] slide 22 please
[49:33] remember
[49:36] jeremiah is now old he's in babylon
[50:51] and i found one thing in common
[50:55] of these three individuals
[50:58] look at what ezekiel five one says
[51:01] three one three one they say
[51:05] this is moreover
[51:21] he's already in babylon
[51:25] and he said
[51:26] moreover he said unto me son of man
[51:31] i'll find this
[52:01] is
[52:06] [Music]
[52:32] you know when something like this so
[52:33] dramatic that the people of israel were
[52:35] going through
[52:39] they were they were stripped
[52:43] they were stripped from their homes
[52:46] uprooted from their homes
[52:52] enough to get food or their belongings
[53:40] foreign
[53:44] the holy spirit has wanted us to speak
[53:46] on these things
[54:35] word of god
[54:41] [Applause]
[54:48] [Music]
[54:48] [Applause]
[54:59] [Music]
[55:18] when you're uprooted
[55:23] my question is what's going to be left
[55:24] to you
[55:29] if they stripped you
[55:30] what would they find what would be left
[55:38] if they would take everything
[55:41] would you still have the joy that you
[55:42] have today
[55:59] that's why they could prophesy
[56:14] but his delight is in the law of the
[56:15] lord and his law that he meditate day
[56:17] and night
[56:26] you don't know when there's going to be
[56:27] a squeeze to the bride
[56:47] we're in the last times brothers and the
[56:49] end times
[56:53] number two
[56:55] slide thirty-one
[57:28] jeremiah is in jerusalem and he dies in
[57:30] jerusalem
[57:34] in babylonia ezekiel is in babylon
[57:52] the forehead of those
[57:59] of those that cry that cry out
[58:04] for the abominations
[58:45] [Music]
[58:52] [Applause]
[59:16] in the in chapter 9 daniel's already an
[59:19] old man
[59:25] and he begins to see the writings of
[59:27] jeremiah
[59:32] and he sees that the designated time is
[59:34] is near
[59:41] and he jumps for joy
[1:00:00] to seek by prayer and supplications with
[1:00:02] fasting and sacrifice and ashes
[1:00:07] and i paid him to the lord my god
[1:00:11] i made my confession and said
[1:00:26] it's
[1:00:37] sinned
[1:00:41] [Applause]
[1:01:06] is
[1:02:01] when you know that you should do
[1:02:02] something you don't do it
[1:03:00] that we
