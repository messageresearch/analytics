[23:20] god
[23:44] if we may open our bibles
[23:46] um
[24:15] we're happy to have him here still
[24:20] the word of god says like this
[24:30] and moses was learned in all the wisdom
[24:32] of the egyptians and was mighty in the
[24:35] in words and in deeds
[24:37] let's pray
[24:40] lord jesus christ
[24:58] and
[25:26] thank you for everything
[25:29] christ
[25:54] oh
[25:56] a person or a theme parapelliculus for a
[25:58] movie para para libros or books
[26:02] or work of arts
[26:05] and for many other things
[26:07] moses is
[26:21] [Music]
[26:50] amongst
[27:04] or the chief of egypt the converter
[27:07] in pharaoh
[27:10] of that man
[27:12] that was in the desert
[27:14] for 40 years
[27:16] and could survive hablar
[27:18] to
[27:28] [Applause]
[27:58] the first five books of the bible
[28:28] you
[28:41] read
[28:57] run in a cycle of 40s
[29:00] he was called at 40.
[29:03] refused by his brethren
[29:08] went out to
[29:10] on the desert and herded sheep for 40
[29:13] years
[29:14] when he was 80
[29:17] israel
[29:18] he sent him down delivered israel out of
[29:20] egypt
[29:23] and when he got close to the promised
[29:25] land
[29:27] he was 120 years old
[29:32] he had the stride of a young man
[29:35] and his sights never failed him
[29:38] that's right
[30:06] but look
[30:34] authority
[31:29] leaving everything behind the candle la
[31:31] grande leaving the greatness
[31:41] that they were going to worship his name
[31:42] erase his name
[32:27] el saldo the wage era
[32:30] was of a man who failed
[32:33] a man
[32:35] lost everything
[32:37] a man
[32:40] where he abided
[32:42] was known
[32:44] but now
[32:46] he was found himself alone
[32:49] found himself frustrated
[32:54] as a failure
[33:04] this is what i want to read from our
[33:06] brother branham
[33:07] yeah
[33:36] that's been total
[33:50] to your parents
[34:18] even as a preacher
[34:20] how many times
[34:23] have i failed
[34:24] to you i'm his father it's my parents
[34:26] i'm hermano it's my brother
[34:30] but let that not be in finale
[35:27] we don't have a strong character
[35:32] come on brother
[35:33] come on look
[35:35] when we talk about failure
[35:38] no one likes to talk about faith
[35:41] no one likes to hear the word failure
[37:18] because he decided to do it
[37:20] for himself
[37:33] you come to be as a failure as moses was
[37:38] look
[37:43] at
[37:44] before moses manifest manifested
[37:48] what god had
[38:02] many times i see your mess until that's
[38:04] how i felt
[38:06] i leave god outside
[38:09] i'm in my room
[38:12] just like our pastor said last wednesday
[38:16] television
[38:30] but when i look
[38:43] let me in
[38:46] [Music]
[39:11] many times it's the hand of god
[39:15] and i believe
[39:17] that when moses
[39:19] killed that egyptians
[39:24] maybe he fed in darkness
[40:08] i'll give entry to my brother
[40:15] now we found moses being called it
[40:18] and after being commissioned
[40:24] he filled his commission by trying to do
[40:25] it in the way that he thought was best
[40:29] therefore
[40:35] it teaches us again that we can't take
[40:36] what we think is best
[40:40] what man think thinks is best
[40:45] we've got to take the way that god has
[40:47] said is best
[40:49] therefore
[41:06] we find out that he fled from the face
[41:08] of pharaoh into the wilderness
[41:18] god
[41:32] it's interrupted
[42:00] i have
[42:14] take
[42:49] god
[42:51] [Applause]
[42:58] god bless you brothers
[43:03] who's happy to be here tonight
[43:07] failure isn't my final and
[43:11] if we can
[43:13] turn our bibles to exodus chapter 2
[43:15] verse 11 and 12.
[43:20] verse
[43:48] and it came to pass in those days when
[43:50] moses was grown that he went out unto
[43:52] his brethren and looked on their burdens
[43:55] and he spied an egyptian smiting in
[43:57] hebrew one of his brethren
[44:04] says
[44:12] and he looked this way and that way and
[44:14] when he saw there
[44:15] was no man he slew the egyptian and hid
[44:18] him in the sand
[44:34] and the message that we talked with
[44:36] titled this
[44:40] failure is not my final el fracasso
[44:44] you know and moses grew up receiving
[44:46] some of the best education
[44:57] it was some of the best science that
[44:59] ever existed
[45:02] when he float like the brothers said
[45:04] previously
[45:07] uh
[45:08] he was floating down the the nile river
[45:15] and he was picked up by pharaoh's
[45:16] daughter
[45:22] and she named him moses
[45:25] and to review it again
[45:28] it means taken out or drawn out
[45:30] significant
[45:43] you know if if we were to build try to
[45:46] build a pyramid like they build then
[45:50] we wouldn't be able to do it
[45:54] you know
[45:55] and i can just imagine how er
[45:58] how educated moses was
[46:03] his mother always told him
[46:06] you're gonna deliver one day deliver the
[46:08] savior children
[46:17] but he tried to do it he he but he knew
[46:20] he was going to do it one day
[46:24] and when he saw the egyptians
[46:40] and at that time he thought he unders he
[46:42] thought he was doing the right thing
[46:46] but even his only even his his own
[46:49] brothers didn't did it didn't want to be
[46:51] in his side
[46:52] yeah
[47:00] you know because he thought he was doing
[47:02] the right thing
[47:04] but he ran away
[47:14] and when he fled to the to the
[47:16] wilderness
[47:18] he met their uh uh
[47:20] ethiopian girl is
[47:25] i'm not sure if i'm going to pronounce
[47:27] her name right
[47:30] but her name is sapporo
[47:35] sephora sephora
[47:37] and she bear two children
[47:41] and moses became the the sheep herder
[47:48] for his father-in-law
[47:51] and i'm sure at that time
[47:54] he was living very comfortably
[47:58] and he probably had forgotten about his
[47:59] education
[48:02] and how smart he was
[48:05] and you know and that's the way god
[48:07] wanted him
[48:09] you know that's the way he wanted him so
[48:11] he can go and and and and and speak to
[48:14] him
[48:17] and one day when he was
[48:19] wandering through through
[48:21] he was wondering in the wilderness
[48:28] that's when he saw the burning bush
[48:32] and
[49:22] and he said there's no way it's going to
[49:23] be possible
[49:26] because i am not educated and they're
[49:28] not going to believe me
[49:34] you know i failed them and they're not
[49:36] going to believe me because i failed
[49:37] them
[49:40] but god told them go back and do it
[49:56] israel it didn't matter how
[50:00] how he thought he was a failure
[50:04] but had something for him
[50:07] he knew
[50:08] elsa
[50:10] that it didn't matter how many times he
[50:11] had failed
[50:14] god had restored his faith
[50:18] you know and sometimes we can't have
[50:20] faith
[50:23] you know because we we want to be we
[50:26] want to educate ourselves with so many
[50:28] different things
[50:32] you know how brother tito said on on
[50:34] wednesday
[50:36] we fill ourselves with more things with
[50:38] more tv than what we do with the word of
[50:40] god
[50:43] and you know and to be honest
[50:46] i think i could be honest with you guys
[50:49] sometimes i feel myself with more things
[50:51] of the world
[51:07] you know i i i to be honest i i i am a
[51:10] failure
[51:11] yo so you know yeah you know i am a
[51:14] failure of what this
[51:15] what the bible has for us
[51:19] you know we we we we need to empty
[51:22] ourselves
[51:25] we need to empty ourselves
[51:27] because when we're filled with things of
[51:29] the world
[51:32] you know we cannot we cannot let god in
[51:34] nope
[51:49] he filled himself he filled him with
[51:51] faith
[51:51] jose normally says confess and i believe
[51:54] that he can fill our uh fill us again
[51:59] you know it you know it doesn't matter
[52:01] how many times you fail important
[52:07] it doesn't matter how many times you get
[52:09] knocked down
[52:11] but what matters is how many times you
[52:13] get back
[52:16] michael jordan once said michael jordan
[52:18] you know a winner is just a loser that
[52:20] tried again
[52:24] so brothers it doesn't matter how many
[52:26] times
[52:28] it says
[52:29] but you have to just keep trying
[53:25] does not mean that god left us behind
[53:27] significa
[53:29] it means that god has a better way for
[53:31] you and i think
[53:34] you know we have to let god work in us
[53:39] we may fail god
[54:18] but we need we need to empty ourselves
[54:20] with this modern trend
[54:22] thread
[54:24] one more time
[54:25] but we need to empty ourselves with this
[54:27] modern thread
[54:29] tren
[54:35] and we have to let god
[54:42] you know
[54:44] the world looks nice
[54:48] it looks beautiful honestly
[54:51] and it looks like you want to go and
[54:53] have fun just like the world list
[54:58] you know but we weren't called for that
[55:02] we were called for something better
[55:04] algo
[55:19] el tiempo
[55:20] to let those gifts pour out
[55:24] you let those gifts bloom
[55:28] you know sometimes we don't let them go
[55:30] out which is not
[55:32] gonna
[55:32] be because we're too full with the
[55:35] things of the world
[55:38] and we let those things hold us back
[55:42] i know i let those things happen
[55:46] they let me they hold me back
[55:49] and how is the way that god can help us
[55:54] i want to read a scripture
[55:58] but brother isaac is going to help me
[56:00] now
[56:13] espanol
[56:53] he can't do that he can't do it it's
[56:56] against his principles he'd have to go
[56:58] against his word and that he will not do
[57:00] he will not do it as long as you don't
[57:03] cope with his word you have to come
[57:05] we've got to come to this before
[57:07] anything else can be done you know that
[57:09] every one of you is aware of that how
[57:11] many believes that raise your hand sure
[57:13] you believe it now let's do something
[57:15] about it
[57:17] i don't know about you but i want to do
[57:18] something
[57:21] i want to empty myself
[57:24] i can imagine
[57:25] moses
[57:27] when he got his wife
[57:30] and and and
[57:32] his two kids
[57:34] and he went back to egypt
[57:37] and he said i am gonna do one man
[57:39] invasion
[57:44] he's going to deliver the whole
[57:46] pueblo
[57:48] you know imagine how determined he was
[57:50] going
[57:51] to determine
[58:19] just be determined like moses
[58:23] don't let nothing hold you back
[58:26] it doesn't matter how many times you
[58:27] fail
[58:30] just keep going
[58:35] just keep going
[58:37] it doesn't matter what the enemy comes
[58:39] and tells you important
[58:41] it tells you how many times you have
[58:43] failed
[58:45] he brings all your mistakes
[58:50] it doesn't matter how many times he
[58:51] brings your past to you
[58:56] you know what we need to do today
[58:58] we need to bring him his future
[59:01] record
[59:16] stronger than
[59:25] hallelujah
[59:36] i was reading a few moments ago
[59:40] scripture
[59:41] that somebody you wrote
[59:44] is
[59:58] but not everyone will get up after that
[1:00:02] always remember this embargo
[1:00:05] even though el fracasso no es definitivo
[1:00:09] failure is is not is not final
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:55] and it gives me a great happiness
[1:01:00] to see what god has for them in their
[1:01:02] coming years
[1:01:07] moses was that typical child
[1:01:22] we've all heard
[1:01:50] it's not enough
[1:02:04] you're a child of god
[1:03:13] uh
[1:03:19] [Music]
[1:03:28] oh
[1:03:42] god's plan
[1:03:45] but before that
[1:03:50] moses grew up with many things upon him
[1:03:55] perhaps he would ponder
[1:05:05] vision for our lives
