[28:27] christopher greet you in the precious
[28:28] name of the lord jesus christ

[28:38] i hope that you feel welcome
[28:56] through the internet
[28:58] brothers from california
[29:01] our precious brothers
[29:02] as well
[29:04] and all around the world
[29:07] you uh we just love you if you just open
[29:09] our bibles
[29:11] the book of proverbs
[29:13] chapter 11
[29:16] um verse 14. proverbial
[29:19] proverbs 11 14.
[29:41] is the people fall but in the multitude
[29:43] of counselors there is safety
[29:46] let us pray
[29:48] eternal heavenly father
[29:51] we thank you
[30:34] restoring the man
[30:48] this title in the form of a question
[30:52] what guy's your life
[30:57] now the word guy or jordicho or better
[31:00] said the person
[31:03] the person a guide
[31:07] it's a guide
[31:12] that has to know the way
[31:14] he has to know where he's going
[31:30] is
[31:46] as a guide
[31:48] because he is chosen and he is prepared
[31:53] to undertake the work
[31:58] i
[32:21] that he would be a man of god first
[32:25] he has to first be a man of god
[32:27] [Music]
[32:29] we need men of god
[32:32] our church
[32:33] our families
[32:55] that eva or in other words eve
[32:58] adam already had a work
[33:02] it was to follow what god had told him
[33:07] and look at
[33:19] he says
[33:28] and there here was god unfolding himself
[33:31] now down into let us make man which was
[33:34] his son
[33:49] and let him have dominion over the
[33:50] cattle the field so forth
[33:57] now the man led the men that led the
[33:58] cattle and everything yeah
[34:19] this way
[34:21] call the sheep over to this pasture
[34:25] call the fishes to this water
[34:30] everything obeyed him entonces
[35:07] because i'm going to clean up this area
[35:10] maybe to the cattle
[35:12] you would guide them to different paths
[35:28] the
[35:51] perhaps maybe a lion would come up close
[35:55] and he would just caress him
[36:10] but don't take advantage of the smaller
[36:11] ones
[36:13] you are here to defend them
[36:15] [Music]
[36:16] i could imagine adam like that
[36:19] in one of his first offices
[36:22] guiding creation
[36:38] he gets lost consequence here and
[36:41] the consequence
[36:45] all the creation
[36:47] all the animals
[36:49] are lost as well
[36:51] because the guide
[37:06] nor was
[37:32] [Music]
[38:16] is
[38:43] a wonderful
[39:11] the prince of peace
[39:22] i could imagine
[39:24] that the devil
[39:26] was
[39:55] once again
[39:57] to the light
[39:59] and to the truth of his word amen
[40:03] because the father
[40:05] that gave it to me
[40:07] it's greater than all
[40:22] made
[41:12] [Music]
[41:17] it didn't matter
[41:56] that's why i know the holy spirit is my
[41:58] compass
[42:00] that
[42:14] is my anchor
[42:18] when troubles are on
[42:19] estrella
[42:20] he's my north star
[42:23] when i'm lost
[42:26] the holy spirit is my compass
[42:56] is
[43:09] that's the way the denomination is
[43:14] [Applause]
[43:36] as our pastor told us this morning
[44:17] his words
[44:22] [Music]
[44:34] yes there are
[44:49] in the message what will we do with this
[44:50] jesus called the christ
[44:53] the holy spirit is the compass
[44:57] and the north star is the word
[45:01] the compass only points to the north
[45:03] star
[45:05] and the holy spirit will only
[45:08] point to um
[45:10] to toward the word
[45:13] it doesn't make any other movements
[45:44] it has to line up with
[45:46] [Music]
[46:27] because also
[46:29] in this church
[46:32] leaders leaders
[46:35] we should continue praying
[46:36] so that god
[46:38] would rise up more guys
[46:40] but
[46:45] line up with the north star
[47:08] from from mexico to the united states
[47:14] i was about four years old
[47:20] and i i just i was left without the
[47:22] image of my father but it was the grace
[47:26] and mercy of god
[47:28] that through my brother estevan
[47:31] he rolls up a guide
[47:33] and i thank him
[47:36] you know
[47:47] young lad he would tell me you want to
[47:48] go out with me he's a kiddo and i would
[47:50] tell him yes i do
[47:52] he would say come on
[47:53] you got amigos and his friends would
[47:55] arrive
[47:58] up and down
[48:00] and in front of me there was
[48:02] there was a liquor store
[48:19] three or four itomando and then drinking
[48:24] and then when i saw that they would
[48:26] offer him a drink
[48:28] alcohol or
[48:29] or wine or liquor
[48:32] or
[49:00] it wasn't because i wanted you to be all
[49:02] up in the mix
[49:04] but i i wanted you to me
[49:09] don't don't allow anyone to put a gun to
[49:11] your head
[49:13] so that you would do no
[49:28] and i thank
[50:04] i'll be closing with this
[51:33] god bless you
[51:37] [Applause]
[51:44] [Applause]
[51:58] [Music]
[52:02] let's go to uh john 16 13.
[52:10] god bless uh the word our brother
[52:11] brought this this morning
[52:15] eric and our brother erica
[52:32] but when the spirit of truth comes he
[52:33] will guide you into all truth
[52:37] let's go to john um
[52:40] 14
[52:42] 6 26 marcel consolador
[52:55] but the counselor the holy spirit whom
[52:56] the father will send in my name he will
[52:58] teach you all things
[53:02] we would be so kind as to be seated
[53:04] just want to thank our pastor
[53:06] with the trust
[53:09] he places in us
[53:12] not easy
[53:36] [Music]
[53:55] and that's how this message came about
[53:58] it was the guide
[54:01] and then i began to think uh
[54:06] how god brought me from mexico to the
[54:08] united st
[54:38] he needs to know what position he needs
[54:40] to know what position what his position
[54:41] is
[54:43] if god is restoring you
[54:46] whether you be man
[54:48] you need to know
[54:50] what your position is
[54:52] we're speaking on a guide
[54:58] but you know as a housewife
[55:01] you are also a guy
[55:02] for your children
[55:22] sometimes he focuses more on fulfilling
[55:24] the desires
[55:25] of his wife and he forgets what he was
[55:27] called to it was called to be a leader
[55:42] you know as i see that many of the the
[55:44] youth that are courting
[55:46] it
[55:57] [Music]
[56:00] how it
[56:27] okay i said okay
[56:55] to your
[56:56] children
[56:58] you are a guy
[57:00] with your life
[57:05] you're a true guy
[57:08] well you yourself
[57:10] are being
[57:24] 2022
[57:48] [Applause]
[58:20] i have the the luggage ready i'm over
[58:22] here with my family
[58:26] can you imagine what kind of guide
[58:28] matrimony
[58:29] what kind of marriage
[58:31] this is
[58:33] the luggage is ready
[58:48] i'm
[59:01] [Music]
[1:00:12] fear enter into
[1:00:38] he did many things
[1:01:36] it will come out to help
[1:01:38] to lift him up
[1:01:41] because sometimes we forget
[1:01:44] that we were in a worse condition
[1:01:48] and very easily we opened up
[1:02:21] we're shown to be more likely than men
[1:02:23] to experience major uh depressive
[1:02:25] episodes
[1:02:28] you know there's a lot of depressed
[1:02:29] people
[1:02:30] even here in the church
[1:02:46] this
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:45] [Music]
[1:03:49] i was driving with my father-in-law
[1:03:53] and we were going to see a sister atita
[1:04:51] look
[1:04:51] you say uh
[1:05:06] separation of a of a marriage
[1:05:10] the people become depressed
[1:05:13] they think that because they're they
[1:05:15] think they're alone
[1:05:17] you know why
[1:05:20] because they truly haven't known can you
[1:05:22] stand so long but they're not alone
[1:05:26] you'll never be alone
[1:05:34] that was leading us from mexico to the
[1:05:36] united states
[1:05:37] i remember when he got lost
[1:05:43] men can get lost
[1:05:45] the man can fail
[1:06:02] that we went up our mountain
[1:06:05] it was about the third or fourth year

[1:06:09] we didn't have any food
[1:06:11] the guide was lost
[1:06:16] i was uh i was a teenager about 16 years
[1:06:19] old
[1:06:21] and i remember brothers
[1:06:24] and i say it for for his honor
[1:06:29] so you would never think
[1:06:31] solo that you're alone
[1:06:35] that's a thought of the devil
[1:06:39] i remember when we were on the mountain
[1:06:41] and we were we come down you know
[1:06:44] and one of the
[1:08:08] brothers
[1:08:50] god
[1:09:03] and he said
[1:09:32] it was three of us
[1:09:34] and they took us to dallas
[1:09:38] brothers
[1:09:40] out of nothing
[1:09:43] that was this man
[1:09:46] and god
[1:09:58] but god has a purpose
[1:10:14] you could be
[1:10:42] when they came
[1:11:20] but he with all the pain in his heart
[1:11:23] he knew
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:52] they began to complain so much about him
