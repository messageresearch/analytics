[25:18] to the book of First Kings chapter 11 1
[25:21] verse verse 1 through 4.
[25:25] thanks to God for the opportunity
[25:35] California our brothers from California
[25:37] internet and all of those who watches
[25:40] via the Internet
[25:42] the word of God says like this
[25:55] but King Solomon loved many strange
[25:57] women together with the daughter of
[25:59] pharaoh woman of the moabites ammonites
[26:03] adamites
[26:05] zidonians and Hittites
[26:21] verse two of the Nations concerning
[26:23] which the Lord said unto the children of
[26:24] Israel ye shall not go into them neither
[26:27] shall they come in unto you for surely
[26:29] they will turn away your heart after
[26:31] their gods Solomon claim unto these in
[26:34] love
[26:37] is
[26:39] 700 wives princesses and 300 concubines
[26:44] and his wives turned away
[26:55] it came to pass when Solomon was owed
[26:58] that his wives turn away his heart after
[27:00] other gods and his heart was not perfect
[27:02] with the Lord his God as was the heart
[27:04] of David with his father
[27:09] you may be seated
[27:24] vanity under the sun
[27:30] a chosen King by God
[27:36] a son of
[27:39] according to the heart of God
[27:42] as they have preached to us already
[27:46] Solomon had a dream
[27:51] would give him a gift of wisdom
[27:55] now we know that the gifts are for the
[27:57] people
[27:59] and it's not for those who operates
[28:04] that blinded Solomon a little because
[28:08] he took advantage of that gift he
[28:12] started well
[28:13] he started to Reign good dios
[28:17] God Vindicated him
[28:19] God Vindicated what he dreamed
[28:24] and the god of wisdom God manifested
[28:26] through him
[28:28] God manifested in a man amen
[28:33] a legitimate gift of God
[28:36] foreign
[29:23] persuade him
[29:29] we can see in First Kings chapter 2 21
[29:32] and 22
[29:36] speaking on the Chiba
[29:39] they say
[29:43] and she said
[29:46] and I be given unto Niger thy brother to
[29:49] wife
[30:05] the king of Solomon answer and said unto
[30:07] his mother and why does thou ask
[30:09] Abhishek and Shino Knight for adonijah
[30:11] as for him the kingdom also for he is my
[30:14] elder brother even for him and for
[30:16] abaithar the priest and for joab the son
[30:19] of zeroyah is
[30:37] and King Solomon swore before God for
[30:40] God saying do me as
[30:43] God even unto me be added
[30:51] amen
[31:32] because he gathered riches for himself
[31:38] in reality all of Israel was rich
[31:41] because there was Prosperity
[31:44] but there was some laws and we'll see
[31:48] later on for the Kings of Israel
[31:54] says
[32:05] I got me servants and maidens and had
[32:08] servants born in my house also I had
[32:10] great possessions of Great and Small
[32:11] cattle above all that were in Jerusalem
[32:13] before me
[32:15] is
[32:24] I gather me also silver and gold and the
[32:27] peculiar Treasure of kings and all the
[32:28] provinces I got me men singers and women
[32:31] singers and the Delights of Sons of men
[32:33] as musical instruments and and that all
[32:36] and all all of that sorts
[32:45] so I was great and increased more than
[32:47] all that were before me Jerusalem also
[32:49] and my wisdom remained with me
[32:53] so we see that Solomon starts to fall
[32:57] in verse eight he said
[33:00] the Delights of the sons of men
[33:03] he says he has as a musical instruments
[33:07] maybe with Pagan
[33:12] downtown
[33:14] going to downtown
[33:30] when I got over here the center the
[33:32] downtown hasn't gotten any better
[33:33] they say
[33:38] verse 9 says also my wisdom remained
[33:41] with me
[33:44] we see that although he began to fall
[33:47] God did not take that gift away
[33:50] the guests continue to operate
[33:54] so what does that
[33:56] means
[33:58] that even if you have the best gift in
[34:00] church
[34:01] be a preacher musical or a musician
[34:05] salvation the gift doesn't guarantee you
[34:09] salvation that's right
[34:11] doesn't guarantee you being with God
[34:16] it doesn't mean that God is backing you
[34:18] up
[34:19] because the gift is not for you
[34:24] [Music]
[34:26] hola
[34:29] so we see that God had a sequence
[34:38] he reigned
[34:41] he didn't take the kingdom away
[34:43] 40 years
[34:46] and the word of God says
[34:51] giving his heart to the world
[34:53] 40 years until he died
[34:57] God didn't take him away from the scene
[35:00] but he had a purpose I had a purpose
[35:05] I like to read some Commandments for the
[35:09] Kings
[35:12] as read in Deuteronomy in Israel before
[35:16] there was a king in Israel
[35:18] because God knew that they were going to
[35:20] ask for a king
[35:22] and God knew that they would derail or
[35:24] adios
[35:26] but God you can't hide anything God
[35:29] knows everything
[35:30] everything that you do everything that
[35:33] you think
[35:34] God already knew it
[35:38] he's in the presence
[35:53] foreign
[35:54] to the land which the Lord thy God
[35:57] giveth thee and shall possess it and
[35:59] shall dwell therein and shall say I will
[36:02] say they came over me like as all of the
[36:04] Nations that were that are about me
[36:19] whom the Lord thy God shall choose one
[36:22] from among thy Brethren shall thou said
[36:24] as king over there thou mayest not set a
[36:27] stranger over thee which is not thy
[36:29] brother
[36:30] and the sixth thing is for the king is
[36:42] but but he shall not multiply horses to
[36:44] himself nor cause the people to return
[36:46] to Egypt to the end that he should
[36:48] multiply horses for as much as the Lord
[36:50] has said unto you ye shall henceforth
[36:52] return no more that way
[36:59] neither shall you multiply wives to
[37:01] himself that his heart turned not away
[37:03] neither have he greatly multiplied to
[37:05] himself silver and gold
[37:24] not just have many women
[37:29] these are riches for himself in
[37:32] abundance
[37:35] this had a purpose
[37:42] maybe if he would have had 700 wives
[37:45] Israelites
[37:48] the scene would have changed a little
[37:50] well
[37:52] Mundo but he started to mix with the
[37:54] world
[37:56] when you start to mix yourself with the
[37:59] world
[38:01] that doesn't mean you can't have a
[38:02] friendship
[38:04] sick
[38:36] aura
[38:39] foreign
[39:04] [Music]
[39:20] David represented Christ do you believe
[39:24] that
[39:26] the Congress says amen Christ
[39:28] is going to sit in Israel yesterday
[39:32] and it's David a man after God's Own
[39:34] Hearts had 500 wives
[39:38] see what I mean
[39:42] David with his 500 wives Solomon with
[39:44] his thousands
[39:47] the son of David in the natural
[39:49] representation which represents Jesus
[39:52] Christ
[39:54] the son of David in the spiritual okay
[39:57] yeah
[40:02] this is going to be spiritual created
[40:05] life created why
[40:09] Ben
[40:10] is
[40:14] that's the way it was in the beginning
[40:16] but not not now the life we live now
[40:21] don't let that escape you accepted
[40:24] accept it in your hearts
[40:29] but neither of those women could have
[40:32] another husband
[40:33] he was of the original creation
[40:39] none of those women could have another
[40:41] husband
[40:42] but that husband could have a thousand
[40:45] wives
[40:46] thus saith the Lord that's the Bible
[40:52] now I went back took my time
[40:59] and show you about you under and what
[41:00] started and what Jesus said
[41:02] now do you see it clearly
[41:08] now that was a shadow and a figure
[41:11] the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:15] because the Lord Jesus Christ has a wife
[41:20] that's of all types of all Races
[41:39] Jonah chapter 2 verse 8. this is
[41:47] they that observe lime vanities forsake
[41:50] their own Mercy what is vanity
[41:53] it's an illusion
[41:57] the devil places
[42:00] it's only an illusion something that
[42:03] that
[42:04] something that already passed something
[42:07] that Fades away but nevertheless
[42:10] instead of an illusion
[42:13] stay with the word of God something that
[42:16] is
[42:17] something that remains
[42:22] something
[42:24] that will not never finish
[42:42] God bless you
[42:44] [Applause]
[42:58] this evening
[43:02] I was vanity under the sun
[43:05] is
[43:07] a subtitle
[43:11] Mento wisdom tied to understanding
[43:17] and we will be worried in the word in
[43:19] the Book of Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7.
[43:24] Proverbs chapter 1 verse 7.
[43:29] [Music]
[43:31] this evening I'd like to bring out so
[43:33] much a Sunday school teaching
[43:37] a lot on the Bibles
[43:42] [Music]
[43:43] the whole Bible amen God it says in the
[43:47] following way
[43:51] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[43:53] knowledge
[43:54] let's pray now
[44:00] we come before your glorious presence
[44:12] that's allowed us to be in your place
[44:15] use your service
[44:21] but it's foreign
[44:26] your word through the Holy Spirit
[44:30] to each
[44:32] other
[44:33] every one of us needs this evening we
[44:37] give you thanks for everything
[44:39] to the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:44] [Music]
[44:45] everything is
[44:59] the first scripture I read here is
[45:03] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[45:05] knowledge
[45:08] we know that our Prophet said
[45:17] it's a respective
[45:23] I want a place this is if there's
[45:25] something you can take this evening
[45:27] fear of God yes respect is respect and
[45:32] respect to God is love to God
[45:38] now this evening obviously we're talking
[45:40] about the characters
[45:41] he was a wise man
[45:47] and I'd like to bring the word for
[45:50] wisdom in Hebrew
[45:53] that it's called hokma they say is
[45:56] correct
[46:04] opportuno and this means it's the
[46:07] knowledge and the ability to make the
[46:08] right decisions at the opportune time
[46:10] yes
[46:13] and this evening if you notice I'm
[46:15] preaching in Spanish
[46:18] it's for my brothers
[46:25] [Music]
[46:33] wisdom is a knowledge and the ability to
[46:36] make the right choices
[46:39] to make the right choices
[46:45] [Music]
[46:51] to be able to take the right decisions
[46:54] [Music]
[47:02] foreign
[47:43] [Music]
[48:03] [Music]
[48:16] [Music]
[48:27] [Music]
[48:41] and so the wisdom that I want you to get
[48:43] straightened out on here before we start
[48:46] is a wisdom of God Amen
[48:51] the wisdom of God is
[49:04] try to twist the words now I'm going to
[49:08] jump a little forward on this
[49:12] in order to accept Satan you've got to
[49:15] believe Satan he is
[49:19] and there's a part here that says that
[49:21] there is
[49:22] perverted
[49:26] that is perverted to a perverted cause
[49:29] [Music]
[49:31] don't you give thanks to God that not
[49:33] only
[49:35] not only does the prophet tell us
[49:38] what kind of wisdom there is
[49:42] also tells us how to distinguish one
[49:44] from the earth
[49:49] because he says and anything that would
[49:51] try to twist the word of God
[50:06] this isn't anything that would try to
[50:08] twist the word of God
[50:12] it is the incorrect Spirit
[50:15] as we know in the beginning
[50:18] it's the same as it is today
[50:22] the devil doesn't change his ways
[50:28] or he works the same way foreign
[52:00] we're gonna go through
[52:13] yes sir
[52:15] because
[53:15] the scriptures his Commandments
[53:23] because to understand God and see
[53:28] to know how he conducted
[53:31] his characteristics
[54:10] and the fear of God is to respect
[54:13] and to respect
[54:36] and just because of love can one go
[54:39] through that is
[54:43] and you can only obtain that wisdom
[54:45] through that way of that person foreign
[54:49] [Music]
[55:41] keep my Commandments and live and my law
[55:44] as the ability
[55:46] and I love this part
[55:49] is
[55:54] my sister and call understanding thy
[55:56] King's woman
[55:59] no in English it says
[56:04] but look at how it's saying to wisdom
[56:07] there are my sisters
[56:15] Solomon is saying have them along with
[56:17] you again
[56:19] yes
[56:27] we know that wisdom is the entire word
[56:29] of God but
[56:32] not just having the word of God
[56:35] you understand the word of God in your
[56:39] life
[56:44] that they may keep thee from the strange
[56:47] woman
[56:49] from The Stranger with flat Earth
[56:57] how he is
[57:01] saying is always going to try and make
[57:03] it easy
[57:06] to get a hold of the things that are
[57:09] outside of the word of God
[57:12] and he knows all the things that are
[57:14] going to attract
[57:25] [Music]
[58:08] and be held among the simple ones that
[58:10] discerned among the youths a young man
[58:12] void of understanding again
[58:16] if we can link that a word
[58:19] understanding to knowledge to knowledge
[58:23] and as our pastor has shown
[58:27] that knowledge is
[58:33] and I like to bring this as a Young Man
[58:37] void of understanding
[58:39] um
[58:57] he's going to present everything very
[59:00] easy
[59:01] at the age of 12.
[59:04] I'm opening up here
[59:15] and I had an attraction to them
[59:18] I knew that that attracted me
[59:21] and at a young age
[59:25] I remember that when we moved to
[59:27] California from California to
[59:28] Albuquerque
[59:30] not less than two weeks I already had a
[59:33] girlfriend
[59:36] and a week and a half afterwards I broke
[59:39] up with her and had another one
[59:42] it causes us to laugh right that's funny
[59:45] but
[59:47] the devil isn't playing games
[59:51] playing church
[1:00:09] if they allow themselves
[1:00:13] he knows that he if God can get a hold
[1:00:16] of them or if the devil
[1:00:18] at a young age he knows
[1:00:22] he knows how much he can do
[1:00:26] verse 9 says
[1:00:41] in the Twilight in the evening in the
[1:00:43] black and dark night is
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:49] the devil likes to work in the dark
[1:00:51] places
[1:01:00] youth
[1:01:25] and at the end of the day
[1:01:27] solamentea
[1:01:30] Brothers
[1:01:54] he said do I want a reality to do I want
[1:01:57] an illusion
[1:01:59] that's really what it is
[1:02:01] all the vanities of this world
[1:02:06] it's your choice
[1:02:09] I'm here because of a choice
[1:02:12] because I want something real yeah
[1:02:28] [Music]
[1:02:32] we still want to return to that
[1:02:34] sometimes
[1:02:35] but I returned to this is
[1:02:52] foreign
[1:03:55] all that you need
[1:03:58] to overcome this world God bless you
[1:04:02] [Applause]
[1:04:06] God bless you
[1:04:08] can you guys hear me
[1:04:11] it's been a long time
[1:04:13] I took a little break
[1:04:16] but you know I'm back
[1:04:18] it feels good to be back
[1:04:22] can we give a round of applause
[1:04:26] thank God for this opportunity
[1:04:33] we're putting the trust in me
[1:04:36] and if I can put a little title to this
[1:04:38] message
[1:04:41] vanity will fail you uh
[1:04:47] if we can jump to First of Kings chapter
[1:04:50] 11 verse 11.
[1:04:57] wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon for
[1:05:00] as much as as this is done of thee and
[1:05:04] Dallas has not kept my Covenant and my
[1:05:06] status in which I have commanded Thee I
[1:05:09] will surely rent Thee the Kingdom from
[1:05:11] thee and I will give it into thy
[1:05:13] servanti
[1:05:28] chapter 31 verse 8.
[1:05:36] and the Lord he is that they'll go
[1:05:39] before thee and he will be with thee and
[1:05:41] he will not fail the neither for safety
[1:05:45] fear not neither this mice
[1:05:47] intimidates
[1:05:57] I believe we're towards the end of
[1:05:59] Solomon right
[1:06:02] at this point
[1:06:04] you know God already had taken his
[1:06:06] kingdom
[1:06:08] and he was going to give it to his
[1:06:10] service
[1:06:12] you know he had all the wisdom
[1:06:15] he had everything he wanted
[1:06:18] and we read for for the first couple uh
[1:06:22] chapters of of first of kings
[1:06:26] and how is described on how that Palace
[1:06:29] was built describe
[1:06:32] you know I'm like whoa
[1:06:35] that that's a nice house
[1:06:38] you know that's something nice
[1:06:41] you know me with my one bedroom
[1:06:44] apartment I feel good
[1:06:48] but you know imagine him
[1:06:51] he had a little area that was by the
[1:06:53] beach
[1:06:54] you know it was nice he had everything
[1:07:18] you know
[1:07:23] I believe that he realized
[1:07:25] at that point that everything was just
[1:07:28] vanity
[1:07:30] everything that you have in this world
[1:07:33] it's not for you it's gonna stay here
[1:07:37] one day we will perish and it will be
[1:07:40] here
[1:07:41] you cannot take it with you
[1:07:44] it's gonna be here it's going to stay
[1:07:46] here
[1:07:47] that's where he realized wow I don't
[1:07:49] have nothing
[1:07:52] he didn't do nothing that what God had
[1:07:54] commanded
[1:07:57] you know he he went off to the world he
[1:08:01] had different types of things
[1:08:03] yeah he's he he went and married
[1:08:06] different type of of
[1:08:08] wives
[1:08:11] and he lost everything at the end
[1:08:21] I always ask the question
[1:08:24] I don't know if you ever asked yourself
[1:08:27] and uh sometimes
[1:08:30] let's be
[1:08:32] honestos sometimes I I feel like a
[1:08:35] failure
[1:08:36] I don't know who can relate with that
[1:08:39] let's be honest we all at one point in
[1:08:43] our life felt like a failure
[1:08:45] we felt like we couldn't do it anymore
[1:08:49] we felt like quitting
[1:08:52] we said there is no way for us
[1:08:55] we're gonna throw the towel
[1:08:58] I am a failure I don't know how God can
[1:09:01] make a relationship with me
[1:09:04] I am a failure
[1:09:11] and this being a youth service
[1:09:14] I was reading an article
[1:09:17] why sometimes young people
[1:09:20] sometimes feel like failure
[1:09:25] sometimes we try to fit in with certain
[1:09:27] groups
[1:09:29] and we don't fit in
[1:09:32] we feel like we're the outcasts
[1:09:37] that we're different that we don't fit
[1:09:40] in we say I'm not cool enough
[1:09:45] I don't fit in no no no no no I I am a
[1:09:49] failure
[1:09:50] my mind they try to do certain we try to
[1:09:53] do certain things sometimes
[1:09:55] and we don't get the results we
[1:09:59] take a test
[1:10:02] Ament we take a test
[1:10:04] and we don't get the results we want no
[1:10:06] no uh
[1:10:08] and we feel like a failure
[1:10:11] we said I am not going to be successful
[1:10:20] when you go on social media
[1:10:24] you start looking at other people's
[1:10:26] lives
[1:10:29] and how great they're living their life
[1:10:32] how they're going traveling around the
[1:10:34] world
[1:10:36] and you're just right here your sister
[1:10:38] and you're just sitting here and you're
[1:10:41] like I want to be like them
[1:10:43] I want to travel like them
[1:10:46] you know you start wanting to be like
[1:10:49] them
[1:10:51] all these these uh I don't know what you
[1:10:55] call them these things advocates for
[1:10:57] social media is
[1:11:00] all these influencers
[1:11:04] they make their life seem so happy
[1:11:08] like they're living in Paradise every
[1:11:10] day
[1:11:12] but that's just what they show you
[1:11:15] know deep inside they're probably
[1:11:17] hurting
[1:11:20] you know and that's what we want
[1:11:24] you know we want to go after those
[1:11:26] things sometimes
[1:11:27] that's what I
[1:11:32] that's what our heart wants is
[1:11:36] but all that at the end of the day
[1:11:39] all that stuff from the world
[1:11:42] it's gonna failure
[1:11:45] it's gonna break you hello
[1:11:47] it's going to destroy you are sweet it's
[1:11:50] gonna take you no place
[1:11:53] I've seen a picture once
[1:11:56] it showed a really nice house
[1:12:00] and they showed a very old broken-down
[1:12:02] house
[1:12:07] and I said one was rich
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:13] and the bottoman had another picture
[1:12:16] and they had a picture of two grapes
[1:12:22] and that's
[1:12:24] that's what's going to be the end yes
[1:12:27] you know that's what the world is going
[1:12:29] to be this is looking that's where we're
[1:12:32] gonna end up
[1:12:33] we can have all the riches of this world
[1:12:37] but it's never going to take us nowhere
[1:12:43] that every human being has to fail this
[1:12:46] is
[1:12:49] and I'm going to read this quote trying
[1:12:51] to do trying to do God a service without
[1:12:54] being the will of God
[1:12:58] and I'm just going to paraphrase it I
[1:13:03] I can't let him do it I'll bring the man
[1:13:06] along and his son will rise the
[1:13:08] Everlasting House of God and that was
[1:13:10] David of course which was Solomon a type
[1:13:13] of it and then he failed Every Man Has
[1:13:16] to fail every human being has to fail
[1:13:19] only
[1:13:22] um he said
[1:13:30] foreign
[1:13:37] uh and then you could read the rest of
[1:13:39] them

[1:13:45] one listen to this God is the only one
[1:13:49] that can't failure
