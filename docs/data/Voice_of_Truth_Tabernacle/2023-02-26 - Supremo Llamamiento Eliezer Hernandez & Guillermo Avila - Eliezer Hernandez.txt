Philippines Philippians 3 verse 12 13 and 14. I just want to be obedient to him foreign Ed either were already perfect but I follow after and that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ jesusado verse 13 Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but there's one thing I do forgetting those things which which are behind and reaching forth unto the things which are before I pressed I pressed toward the mark for the price of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus thank you for the opportunity you give us Lord we're here in this place take anything that's contrary to your words but you are the only one that deserves it you may be seated services and the second Services we've been speaking on a purpose and a vision and that is our title our subject and as a thought for this morning it is High Calling we've seen throughout the months each and every one of us has a purpose it doesn't matter who you are important no matter where you come from no matter who your parents is the son of the brother that cleans the church to fulfill a that should be a priority but what is holding us back what is bothering us from fulfilling our purpose hey when I see it and the brothers has spoken to us many times that we have to let go of things in our life a you can mirror studio and when I see and I study I saw some Biblical characters some great characters and I've seen their life yes at a certain point in their life they were afraid it is they were afraid to fulfill their calling so then I ask myself if they were afraid is it bad for us to be afraid fear is nothing bad how we react towards that fear foreign of the Bible says many times fear took them to be cowards do you know what a coward is someone who that knows what they should and they don't do it they take a step back a coward is always looking back [Music] they're always putting excuses a phrase says you will never make history in your comfort zone a cow will always stay in their Comforts they want everything to come to them all the blessings come to them sitting down at church and they don't want to put the effort come on this is in the message a hidden life he speaks about a young boy who won a bicycle this is and if I will look at the present times are the things it is I would be a very discouraged person if we pay attention so what is happening around we're going to get discouraged right and even more if we look back if we look at our mistakes were the mistakes of someone else discourage us it will take us to cowardness he says but I learned the lesson one time a little thing that I heard a man say yes they were going to give away swim bicycle to the best Rider they said you know I don't know whether I ever quoted it in this church he said the boy that could ride a 12-inch plank 100 yards around the city they thought they could write it and was going to win the cards and they had a little one little boy there was kind of a yes it's someone that's it's uh feminine and when he speaks about David um he was a fearful young man he was fearful that was his aspect if we go by what we see foreign they say said when they started off they gave them a little push so that they could get started hold them up and let them start sometimes we all need a little push that they were with him are you randomly helping him on fire behind you so you can see a little push Brothers all the great people go and look at the stories they needed a little push they needed a push so when they start you off to say you were looking down like this trying to keep your bicycle on board but said I never noticed I see and you do that and it makes you nervous Hermanos because that person is why doesn't he put the the the the firewood the chairs the tables I always have to do it but see I never looked down so when you do that it makes you nervous I said you fell off I just put my at the end another phrase says instead of giving up your projects give up laziness give up excuses because we're good to give excuses to a certain point in my life foreign [Music] where they put the metal and it um melts to a certain degree but it has to go through a fire it has to go through a process of giving ourselves when I was young I saw my parents Take Me to Church and good thing and you have to travel hours I didn't even want to go to church foreign or fasting Anton says then it was too much to go to church it was too much to go to church there was a time where I had to make my decisions and a servant of God you have to make a decision that time will always come together and the point that it came in my life the point in taking the decision is if I wanted to be continue put the effort to be brave many times we imagine it requires of an effort so great heavy burden is when I decided to serve God you're already born with it Holy Ghost s the calling is subject to The Giver of the calling yeah they don't take us into account I want to be something big we don't want to be something small yes another [Music] we're doing it for us foreign says living for others is a rule of nature is living for others as a rule of nature life is good when you are happy but life is much better when others are happy because of you know he does not live to serve he does not serve to live not according to ourselves but according to his own purpose which was giving us Jesus in Christ Jesus before the world began we have a holy to fulfill apocalypse so in Revelation 21 uh it speaks of the overcomer and it also speaks of those who are not okay and the first one that I mentioned that is not an overcomer Revelations 21 7 says and a person first first coward incredible for an unbeliever credulous foreign ERS and warmongers and Sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death to a certain extent is for you it's easy to say the family that you come from he's a pastor his purpose see you've got to be in touch with it you say well you ought to be easy for you brother anything you do God just tell you he said no and he says he doesn't I sweat it out like you do yeah and a whole lot harder sure I have to sweat it much harder than you and there's going to be more requirements receive the greatest you say and it didn't work until one did work together it is if it don't fire I won't quit I'll throw that one out as a third and China one of them is God bless you [Applause] foreign amen amen if you can follow me to the scripture in Proverbs 29. chapter 29 verse 18. uh as you find it I heard the story of a father it's almost like a poem they were saying uh a [Music] el padre and he was asking on the father's responsibility and he was saying teach my children to be good children who will teach my children to love the Lord we will teach my children to be a good Christian responsibility on who does that responsibility fall well it falls on me how to be a good Christian I want to show my son to be a true Son of God our own responsibility as parents teach our family where there is no vision the people perish in English in English it says well there is no vision El Pueblo Perez the people perish amen amen you must have a vision amen amen we must know where we're going what do we want to build just a nice Church you know there's many nicer churches in this one Iglesia if we're chasing a church full of members there are churches with five thousand members but what are we trying to reach I believe our pastor's visions and he confessed the first time he preached about this subject he said from this church there would be men capacitados that were capable why is God moving and foreign amen [Applause] amen well my question is can he do everything you cannot do it alone I have good preachers don't just be a good preacher says transmitted [Music] that's where we're headed I don't believe it yeah we have good choirsias then we would be far from them but the prophet said yes voice of God he could not see to get around this is a great heavy man and he had began to let the work of the Lord go undone watch because there's no video because there wasn't a problem because there was in guidance and they were living incorrect lives follow them precious message because there was no vision the people perish what are we chasing what do you want from this church where are you headed do we want great choirs you know in the denomination they produce denominational children there isn't life foreign foreign amen we want to be church members comfortable your food you're so relaxed feed me feed me for lack of vision amen amen is organizations I think the church the organization and denominations they've been on the field for a long time yes and they're beginning getting laxed amen amen the prophet went to churches and they all rejected him the question was that's why the prophet was so rejected they even called him a Woman Haters I don't hate the women the sisters I love them I do this because the prophet would say it says you sister incorrectly fossil this morning what a tremendous message they got a tape from Brother Garcia says that God placed that sperm in there he is and that sounded horrendous horrible for them and they will say how is this is it possible that man can speak such a thing and I told them how are you doing if God would have wanted to form Jesus don't you think he would have been here he could have done it began how life begins with a sperm there is and that man grabbed the tape and destroyed it in his hand and said that's garbage you know where that man is divorced Jose left his wife children and because there's nothing in you I was so rejected amen hallelujah yeah yeah we're finishing now I have a lot here that's why they brought that blind man that Jesus healed they brought him before the first season you remember this story him before them and they said who is this don't you know he's a sinner where is he from having given him Authority the
