chapter verse 44 to 46 Matthew 13. amen the word of God says the Kingdom of Heaven is like treasure hidden in a field when a man found it he hid it again and then his Joy went and sold all he had and bought that field again the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls when he found a one of Great Value he went away and sold everything he had and bought it Lord Heavenly loving father gracias foreign [Music] [Music] everything you've lived through you'll see things at maybe we're pointless yeah they're useful for something good and with this I like to get into the story is when they serve a drink to the king uh Maya's job and taste the drink yes that's right before giving it to the king is the reason why that was done was because in Persia they were known for giving the the king poisonous kill him get rid of him so nemaya lived every day knowing that that might be his last day I didn't know if he would drink a cup with poison but I with a purpose yes and in the same manner God puts us in places from there comes our purpose It won't always be about living our own lives revolves around them a selfish person is before anything I've said it many times they suffer um I had never lived for others the church enjoys it what are we doing foreign and like I told you living for others yes yes of his fathers were in Ruins I believe Nehemiah had no need in working with the king I believe he had everything foreign [Music] [Applause] in that church with our hands arms crossed they say that's the church's business but I'll give you a dollar here we need of everything this building has this is forgive me we enjoy the food after service come on [Music] we must live with a purpose forgive me brethren is let me ask you what leads you guess what moves a person that can't control their Spirits the Bible says the person that can't control their Spirits can't control their speak speech strike versus sometimes we can't control our thoughts our walls are torn down and anything leaves in other words any little thing comes and attacks us and any little thing leaves we shouldn't be doing that's right when you find what moves you know moves your interior being is what this world offers oh this is sometimes we're waiting for God to touch us well God needs us to move sometimes because how can you move a car that's parked foreign sometimes we want things from this world sometimes we don't think things right lately if you see my search history it's all trucks but then I think and what do I need a truck for no La necesito I don't need it I'm still just one person I'm by myself right now [Applause] I want to Satisfy My Flesh for more than that is the god that is more than words [Music] to receive um the message questions and answers brother Branham says do you love him with all your heart isn't he wonderful what could we do now could you tell me anything that would be great if you can show me something great then I'll sell out that's greater than this yes what's the point of having everything if we're going to lose our soul you can please stand the Bible says who wants to save their life well shall lose it so he that loses his life why is it so hard surrender everything together in any church but until you find yes God bless you brother [Applause] foreign verse 24. amen foreign God is good evidence Hebrews 11 24 a life with a purpose is the the title the theme in esta Manana and this morning the word of the Lord says by faith Moses when he was come two years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter escort choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season de Cristo que loses esteeming the reproach of Christ's greater riches and the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the rewards may God our blessing to his word Moses is born in Israelite when he was a child a baby we all know the story there was a decree is and his life was in danger
