on friday that this generation new generation are brother branham said when you are sick you have to begin to confess that you're healed that you're healed you are healed i'm healed i am healed but you know what it is it's your own decisions of decision this is the problem with people tonight with healing divine and everything it's yours go and take it hallelujah hallelujah god promised that you would walk in other words you're healing do you believe it you have to take it god promised life the land they have to clean the house clean our house our home it's yours but he ain't going to come poke it down your neck you got to take the land yourself he gave he gave a chance and it's yours and possess it hallelujah hallelujah it was to each and every one of us god bless you god bless you brothers this was my first year of camp estafoe primer campamento perimerano i thought it was pretty cool yeah like the brother said the theme was as i was with moses so i will be with you and you know on the way there yes and it was a little tiring i got brother said it smells like feet yes the message uh as i was with moses so i will be with you our brother that pharaoh looked like at the people of israel like slaves nothing more than trash but moses looked at the people of israel and god's children and i believe that's what camp was too yo brother brandon said it's the angle you look at it from diesel depending i believe if you look at camp at a certain angle you'll find that god's there and the people there are god's children and on the way back it was a little tiring too el camino but it was a very beautiful experience and for those youth who haven't gone yep and yeah thank you [Applause] god bless you brothers so the first day that we got there they were cutting the lawn my allergies just didn't like they just hit me hard and it kind of affected me throughout the throughout the camp yes i would get tired yo me fatigue because i would get frustrated with my allergies but on saturday they were talking about the new generation and how we have to rise up because yeah because we're the new generation and so i feel like i had a pretty good service on saturday domingo in the morning service i couldn't really be in the service because like my i would get a runny nose super quick santuary [Music] so i was just outside sitting down but still watching and listening because foreign was uh brother bernie the second is uh no i mean william garcia william garcia and it got pretty good but i couldn't really feel anything on the outside but on sun sunday afternoon and the plays yeah there were there were some that made us giggle and all you see here and we had to do a play on neyman when he when moses told him to go wash in the jordan river seven times and um that kind of touched me yes because i i might um might be in church but i feel like i'm not fully in church i feel like i needed to be in like in the church if that makes sense and during the play neyman didn't want to fully listen completely and he would only go in the river like halfways and he he would be like oh it's not working and then i would tell him no seven times go in and i felt like after this well during the service we had a very special time i had a special time with god i felt like i was able to get fully in and be with god because i feel like before i would just be like no you could only go to a certain point but once i opened all my doors it felt super natural um yeah that's all i gotta say brothers well and all if you if you haven't been to the youth camp you see no i need a campaign gracias [Applause] [Music] gracias [Applause] [Music] there was a six of us on our one bed and it was very hot and like i said it smelled like feet william william was lost for three hours i felt like god has started uh heating things up we went to the cabins and then we uh we went to bed la proxima then we went to service and we all but it got to that point we went to bed in the next morning we went to a service not and we just felt like god was working up towards towards something else then the skit service began i there was other brothers there jumping and shouting as well we were crazy yes when i went to camp i said and i've been praying about something for a few months now and like matthew 7 7 says seek and you will find eva it will be given to you he got his 12 hours of sleep those that haven't gone to a camp yet yolo recommendo i would highly recommend it it helped me very much it helped me with my relationship with god and also to know that we're not the only ones that we have other brethren god bless you [Applause] um i really don't know how to give a testimony but we're gonna try so basically it started off when i first found out about camp i had since the beginning i told my parents i did not want to go so do not sign me up they signed me up anyways and for that i was very angry and i was mad at the file that they would sign me up when i said no but them being my parents and they know what's best for me um they knew that i was going to have a really good time and they knew that i was going to enjoy and receive something so on saturday the when we had service i was not expecting to have received anything or i didn't know what to expect i didn't think anything of it um as soon as we started singing um and clapping i started singing and clapping something i never thought i would do because i'm really shy and i keep to myself a lot but i knew that i was doing it for god and i knew what i was doing was right and i hope that he was proud of me in that moment and that he continues to be proud of me but once it was over i was excited but nervous for sunday for the sunday service because i didn't know if i would be receiving anything i just thought it would be a one-time thing but it didn't turn out that way um i received something again i started singing and clapping louder and i was i was surprised with myself because i never thought i would be doing that i'm very very blessed and thankful to have received something and i can't wait to go to camp again with that being said i also have started wearing skirts for the first time not something i would ever have done because i told myself and i told my mom that i that's not me that i was never gonna wear skirts that i'm gonna look weird in them and what if people look at me weird but that's not the case anymore i know what i'm doing is what god wants and i'm trying for him and i don't care about what the world says i'm doing this for him and i'm very blessed to be doing this and thankful so yeah that is my testimony thank you [Applause] god bless you brothers um it's nice to see everyone again i don't know i get a little nervous right here we went to camp campbell i didn't get no sleep we had a game thursday night varsity played at like 8 p.m isaac was picking us up at two o'clock in the morning when i looked at the time or when i came out of the shower giovanna was waiting in the is here uh well giovanna we actually had a good conversation i felt like i really connected with her like was for 30 minutes so i was like daisy right there i just felt like my head bobbing and then they sat me to be honest i didn't really receive nothing in that service and then um well then the food la comida the food was good but i don't know why every time i go to phoenix camp campamento de phoenix i can't eat no no no i was just eating um what are they called fruit fruit things those things that like you put on your tongue fruit roll-ups i was eating those things and um that's the only thing that did good to my stomach and well then that saturday service is when god kind of started working with us i hadn't gone to i didn't go to the altar that night but um isaac osorio he preached a really good message proud of him um but yeah he um i remember him saying talking about the because they invited them but they really didn't welcome him that really touched my heart i was like wow how many times have i invited him i really welcome him i was like i don't feel nothing i'm tired my stomach's upset so the next day yeah we had the place and um i remember um they did a game show play the television there was all these cases anxiety but phoebe picked one one before and that really touched me because it's like why can't we make so many deals with the devil but we can never make a deal with god and well i remember um that night sam was samuel little sam right here was sitting next to me and i still wasn't feeling nothing and i looked at sam he was ballin for him i was like maybe i'll just pray for my brother samuel might as well do something useful so he was just there raising his hands me and you need to deal with each other literally when i stopped someone came to samuel and actually prayed for him so i still didn't feel nothing but i went to the altar anyways and god just touched me right there he answered some questions and yeah i went back to my seat i was just happy that was really good services really fun time when we went to import um but you know if you know the main thing is to receive from god though that was my main reason anyway just to receive more from god you know i we just got back from mexico as well not too long ago you know i was just blessing after blessings so you know i i believe god's doing something great not just with the older older you know all these young guys praising the lord you know jj really really um surprised me remember him coming out i think it was saturday service the guy was on fire i was like i went up to him and i was like bro i'm proud of you he's like he was like he like jumped yeah i know we had some couple of good compliments over there as well now we're clean and everything and okay you just wanna say good job to everyone as well [Applause] amen um this camp was uh it's nothing new it was like i've been there before where i'll go come okay yeah but i had like a new experience instead of being like um like greatly blessed by their preachings i was blessed more by like the people you feel most personas you know um like the first time i went to the camp la primeros hey man i want you to look to your left you say that you got the person look at the person that you're right now the person behind you hey man i met the lady of the lord jesus christ i know we give the lord a handcuff of prayer [Applause] and man just to be able to see so many youth so so it just encourages you yes being able to see brother isaac osorio how he's ministering is definitely inspiration for me amen and and on the way back we were kind of talking with brother tabo gustavo and he was telling us how like the the youth that we went with that's the people that we're that we're gonna that we're gonna serve with in the future you know we're going to be that upcoming generation that we're talking about amen to just to be able to see all the youth just praising god and the guys and the girls we're just all just getting closer to you as brothers and sisters it just it makes you like it makes you want to serve god more la don center servio amen and i like my brother said we've been on a lot of trips this year amen and and to be able to see the youth at that youth campaign man it just gets it just helps it just makes me start to wonder yes so i said what will happen if they took that fire where we go amen i feel like it could be such a blessing brothers so god [Applause] this was my first time at camp and the letter we wrote before leaving specifically i was sincere with god and i said i don't know what i'm looking for at camp but i'm trusting that you will give me what i need and i went to camp and on friday i didn't feel much to say that i rejoiced at camp [Music] when i got back i was thinking on if i did receive something at camp testimonial and i was actually not going to test if i told brother dale i said god is so good and and we don't want to testify about how good he is and god has done great things in my life now was remembering if our destiny is in heaven or hell that was our decision and on wednesday brother titus was also preaching a decision to suffer in this world but how our riches in heaven is our own decision [Music] and i said i prefer to suffer in this world and what the devil offers us that it doesn't matter how much i try to find the things of this world to satisfy me no one will love me more than god satisface nothing will satisfy my soul more than his word more and i recommend all the youth to go to camp as foreign it was a great blessing for me god bless you there were many things going on and at some time i decided and told brother fidel you know i'm not going to camp brother i had spirits fighting against me to my left and right me but in my mind i said if it's for me to go i will go entonces see the cd so and i truly had high expectations for the camp i forgot his name but the brother was sharing that this camp seemed impossible and at that time my father and the brother were there um and then he said what if this camp is for you speaking to my father or what if this camp is for anyone says um i felt like something grabbed my hand it doesn't mean but i follow presents behind me very strong but i saw nothing happen i was meditating on god my father was nothing there anymore and i lifted my hand higher yo travis and i fell on another hand was squeezing me and a voice came to me saying and the subject was time of decision and as i was up there i was meditating and it said i said to myself sometimes i uh persona or a person forget about what god has done in their lives and i was reflecting if today is the day i make my decision to follow christ i believe god bless you brother this is my second time at camp this one would be like my first one pero pero estaba and i just i was like i could just stay home and just live here and just be just do regular things here pero pero yo sentien that i could go to camp again the road was long for me but it was worth it to arrive there first when we got there [Music] i didn't know what to expect [Music] but when uh but on the first day there savion i knew that i was onto something i was going to find something not only the answers i was seeking [Music] but also something else that god had there for me but i knew that i wanted to find a relationship with qatar [Music] i knew i just wanted to be more than just a person that was in their comfort zone when i went to the services that were that were there you are your [Music] [Music] and i was blessed in going there in los angeles to the services we don't know solo in [Music] i knew that i had the courage to to be able to be blessed and received i knew that uh i was there so that god could find me and and so i would follow him the same as joshua and moses did joseph [Applause] god bless you and thankful with god for allowing me to go to the camp i wasn't going to go um [Music] a time back i was suffering a lot with anxiety and i was struggling also with the depression eating ammunition and i was scared of going and then to have an anxiety attack over there something was saying don't go because it could happen [Music] but another park would say uh you could be delivered when we got to camp i felt nervous [Music] [Music] and there was a voice that was telling me to go back to the and to me when i went to the altar somebody went to pray for me and he said that this was my appointment or meeting with god and that we were there at the appointment and i said i wanted to i wanted to make my decisions and the pain would not be greater than he is my heart was my heart for making me feel weird very thankful and grateful with god that i am delivered from my anxiety and depression may god bless you i just want to say that this camp was such a blessing and i can say that um that what i received at camp was tremendous saturday night the yellow team i'm i think did uh a play croco and um it was about uh neyman before i saw that and um it was such a such a touching um drama because um when neyman went into that um when he dipped himself and then oh yeah after seven times and then dipped himself again like completely completely um he came out cleansed el salli and i liked how they brought it to our time how we hide our leprosy and i i i could relate to that because um i've been hiding a lot of things within me and um at this camp um uh someone prayed for me i don't know who it was but you know for me he was telling me that whatever i had just to let it go and just to start confessing and when he was praying for me and when i and when i when i started confessing um something was like my body tightened up and i knew it was god and i just started i'm just confessing your comments are confessed and it felt good um just to just let it all out just place it there before the uh before god's uh and um i can now say that i'm free and i don't have to hide whatever i had within me and um yeah that's it yes god bless you bless you brothers what i want to say is that camp um it was blessing amongst blessing upon blessing upon blessing from the sometimes we don't even look at that we start to not realize we get all excited and remote in the moment and we start seeing people and we we real we don't [Music] we start to overlook how god has already started to bless us from the beginning and it was until the end of camp that i realized that it was until the end of camp that i realized how much god has really blessed each and every one of us as you guys know from the beginning of camp i was extremely excited for all of us that we're going to use we got to and i was there and i was excited for the team that i was going to get yeah so i knew that my friend one of my friends was going to be a leader and i get to the camp i pick out one of the little wristbands and it was her team [Music] she's like here and she gives me a different response i was like lord jesus but little did i realize that god needed me somewhere else and little did i realize that god was going to use me in a different way and sometimes we try to it made me realize that sometimes i always try to push my way with god just to cut it short sunday night el domingo i was looking left and right and i was seeing all of my the youth getting blessed by the lord and the devil came to me and said maybe it's not today maybe it's not this camp maybe that was enough [Music] but i got stubborn and i said no no like i'm not leaving until i get my blessings and brother after brother was praying for me but no one got to the point and i don't know why i just didn't leave you until someone came and gave me what i was looking at and it was until brother william came up william and god used him and he told me exactly what i was going through and that's when i knew yeah it was worth it to stay okay so what i want to say is that youth i know there's a lot of times that we don't understand and we don't feel anything but that's when i say push a little longer uh god bless you brothers um i just want to start off by saying that um that i didn't sign up to be here um to to come up and give my testimony um and i want to say that um that my testimony isn't anything crazy for for you guys but i feel like um testimonials but i feel like why um i just told the brother to come up here was to to ensure what i got um i can say um for everybody else that i feel like your poster um saturday everybody was in it i just couldn't yeah i was singing nothing happened sunday morning pass and i'm still tired [Music] but it's um sunday afternoon where you know everything happened um i think all the plays touched us and um like most some other people said when they were talking about when he was watched seven times of leprosy yeah it definitely um helped me a lot definitely um so for the second part i was blessed um by sharing my gift on playing the guitar ladder because we were at the church and we were checking if everything was going to be okay with the commercials and videos and natalie and um i'm not sure what the guy's name was uh was on the base and they asked me to go up and just play hinata um so i went up and afterwards they asked me hey um do you want to play for service yeah and i'm and i that's when i gave him that unsure answer um and afterwards they they talk to me and they're like we got the okay for you to go esta yares i didn't want to play i'm like i want to be down there i want to be here during like afterwards when they were worshiping um i was in it i was singing and after then i was still kind of like mad that i wasn't able to be a part of it um but now i know why afterwards i told a lot of the other youth i'm like that i feel like my body feels really tired not so much my fingers or anything i just felt like really worn out no simple and um i believe that that i was running and i was jumping like everybody else um i encourage everybody else to continue with the fire that we yeah i was asked but um yeah so let's continue with the fire that we got during the services um yeah i think samuel's coming up but um i think the main reason for camp is to be um amongst youth going towards the same goal you feel that motivation and that and that just great power towards you that gets into you like hey i definitely got part of that motivation in that fire definitely [Applause] um you guys could sit down if you guys want to support me i'm sorry it was my first time going to camp and uh i wanted to thank god for allowing me and my dad to go there along with my brothers and sisters and you know uh before before we were going to go to the camp i think he was on a wednesday crocophone miracles oh we were given these cards we were to write down we're going to receive what we think we were going to receive and you know i was thinking to myself you almost panzano i mean no maybe i'll find a special someone there especially you know i said maybe you'll never know you know but i felt like god was talking to me and he told me son i have a lot more than you thank you a lot more than just that and you know on our way there you know i i made memory memories there is memorials you know we were lost for three hours and i have never seen our brother gamma so frustrated to a point where he posted on his ig story and so uh perfect instagram per videos in phoenix we're lost in phoenix it was a blessing memories on our way over there memorial yeah driving on our way to phoenix no the rv would get bumpy and you know us us as guys that were in the back los muchachos we would like a few inches in the air and you know i felt jealous of her brother jj yostava nos romano because he slept through there and todd man i wish i could sleep and you know uh i think it was on a sunday morning you know i and you know sunday night came by el domingo and you know uh we were worshiping yesterday and i didn't really feel anything you know but i remember what my father would always tell me we have to make a decision [Music] and i felt like i was living a lukewarm life i was living a life where i would live a life for jesus christ and a life for the world you know brothers living the life of a christian isn't easy christianity and you know going to going to the camp you know it was a blessing god wanted me to get out of my comfort zone so then he could so he could uh go to my heart and you know uh i didn't really think yo no pence i was going to raise my hands okay isaac said that uh he watched me at least ten times versus no i was crying a lot you know i was crying to a certain point where i thought my boogers were going to fall off and uh you know that's what i love about our lord jesus christ brothers if you're in you have anxiety it doesn't matter for god he could he could give you a blessing no i thank god for that you [Applause] god bless you brothers i just want to let the youth know not only in phoenix in phoenix but also las cruces they know us as a bunch of oddballs [Music] faith in the elders but in the youth but later on he says but the youth need the elders is what was going on in the first generation at his that in the very very beginning of the camps where our beloved pastor and our sister were witnesses and she would testify to me yeah and the sisters thought that the campground were on fire and they said wow it's not going to stop going no no no so why not join it why not be part of it why not continue that fire and it can be the same thing with us youth that was my blessing and it was a true blessing to enjoy with all of you [Applause] uh [Music] but i believe it's a different kind of a circuit because the testimony that each and every one of them gave is special it's something special brothers i just want to give thanks to each and every one of you of this camp of this uh this trip that we made thank you to our pastor but i had never gotten so tired brothers trying to avoid or trying to hinder us from getting to that camp las cosas i had planned many things and they didn't turn out the way i wanted him to eh uno planeta one plans but god has a different plan i was going with the expectation us you didn't leave us not at one moment and i'm going to share this very quickly because god is really [Music] [Music] i see a car and i kind of turned and looked illuminated and then i i kind of just looked again or i i put my eyes back on the running and i looked again again and i looked again you know this thing given that your fan and i wasn't able to distinguish the the show [Music] but somebody told me to to return to go back it doesn't simplicity it's got it or working in simplicity that's how god is god is real when we come with the career [Music] [Music] if you guys haven't seen his face [Music] [Music] [Applause] who helped god [Music] [Music] no [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] is oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] um [Music] so i know [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it lets us know and that the god keeps using this youth [Music] i've had the privilege to grow up as a youth in the church and i know it's not easy every opportunity that we have every opportunity that you as youth have to grab a little bit more of god take advantage of it because the battle is tough and the devil comes with us with everything he's got [Music] he will um [Music] [Music] our [Music] i give thanks to god for bringing us here safely to vallejo california many thanks
