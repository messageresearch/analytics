[38:27] we we had an awesome time so thank you
[38:29] all very much
[38:33] and and we feel at home I feel like I'm
[38:37] at home
[38:39] I hope you don't mind if I make myself
[38:42] comfortable
[38:45] all right not taking too much more time
[38:48] let's get right into the word this
[38:49] morning
[38:51] we had a tremendous time this morning at
[38:54] the eight of clocks
[39:07] if you would turn in your Bibles to to
[39:09] the Book of Daniel chapter three
[39:14] and and this morning we want to talk
[39:17] about
[39:18] a a topic this morning
[39:21] and that's producing the desired result
[39:24] yes
[39:27] you see we come to church
[39:30] and and we we receive our salvation
[39:35] and a lot of times we we don't know
[39:38] maybe what what the result of of coming
[39:40] to church should be
[39:44] sometimes we we become a Christian by
[39:47] name
[39:49] and we're not sure what the desired
[39:52] result is
[39:55] we reach certain points in our journey
[39:58] along the way
[40:00] and we're not sure what the desired
[40:03] result should be
[40:05] okay so this morning we want to
[40:08] understand what's a desired result
[40:13] what are we supposed to be doing
[40:16] what is the the word of God supposed to
[40:19] be doing in our lives
[40:23] The Book of Daniel chapter 3 verse 15.
[40:28] and it's a story that we know very very
[40:31] well
[40:32] this is the story of Shadrach Meshach
[40:35] and abedna it says
[40:38] and I just want to read the last part of
[40:40] the of 15.
[40:44] and it says and this is Nebuchadnezzar
[40:47] speaking
[40:49] and who is that God that shall deliver
[40:52] you out of my hand
[41:00] answered and said to the Kings
[41:11] we are not careful to answer thee in
[41:15] this matter
[41:16] response
[41:19] and may the Lord add His blessings to
[41:21] the reading of the word and you may be
[41:23] seated
[41:26] now verse 17 says
[41:33] our God whom we serve
[41:36] is able to Deliver Us From The Burning
[41:40] fiery furnace
[41:43] and he will deliver us out of thy hands
[41:49] you see there's something significant
[41:52] about the Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[41:54] stories
[41:57] a lot of times we think about these
[42:00] three young men
[42:03] that's just three Israelites that were
[42:05] scared and terrified of what was about
[42:07] to happen
[42:10] but I want you to know that that's not
[42:13] the case
[42:15] you see these three young men
[42:28] and I learned so much about the way that
[42:31] the Israelites and the Jews think and
[42:33] operate
[42:38] you see from the time there's three or
[42:40] four years old
[42:44] these young men sit in front of the
[42:46] Wailing Wall
[42:47] foreign
[43:03] [Music]
[43:47] that is to
[44:15] you see they purposed within themselves
[44:19] to create a situation
[44:24] that would produce
[44:27] desired results
[44:38] and they knew the statue would be a
[44:42] solid gold
[44:44] and they began to do their research and
[44:48] they're plotting and they're planning
[44:51] and they said we will produce a
[44:54] situation
[44:58] what's the result that we look for
[45:03] Esperance
[45:06] because we want to see him
[45:11] how many of us walk every day
[45:21] what's the desired result of my
[45:24] salvation
[45:24] [Music]
[45:28] can be made manifested
[45:32] but these young men approached
[45:34] nebuchadnezzars
[45:35] and when everyone else
[45:41] us three young men still standing
[45:44] and they knew Nebuchadnezzar was going
[45:47] to call them up
[45:50] and they knew Nebuchadnezzar had a foul
[45:53] temper it
[45:54] is
[46:01] why the Bible tells us
[46:04] there were Nebuchadnezzar approach them
[46:08] they said we are prepared for this
[46:11] question
[46:14] we are ready for your for your for your
[46:17] trouble for your problems
[46:20] and we're ready to give you an answer in
[46:23] a certain way
[46:26] and if you notice the answer that they
[46:29] returned to Nebuchadnezzar is
[46:33] it wasn't an answer of well you know
[46:37] we're we're we're sorry
[46:41] they were confident where they stood
[46:46] they were men on a mission
[46:50] they would be stopped by nowhere
[46:54] and they walked up to the king of that
[46:56] area
[46:58] look keep squaring the eyes
[47:01] and they said we will not
[47:06] Bowser says
[47:09] but you know these young men they had
[47:12] something on their minds
[47:14] because they knew something that they
[47:17] had learned from studying
[47:20] they knew that there's a certain number
[47:24] that produced the results
[47:28] and they looked back in the laws
[47:32] and they saw that on in Genesis
[47:37] it was on the seventh day foreign
[47:45] [Music]
[48:22] [Music]
[48:35] better Elijah said I see a cloud about
[48:38] the size of a man's hands
[48:42] and they knew that was Joshua
[48:46] when they got to Jericho
[48:49] they knew that it was the seventh time
[48:52] around
[48:54] that they would blow the trumpet seven
[48:57] times
[49:09] and so when they went before
[49:11] Nebuchadnezzar
[49:14] Nebuchadnezzar said heat the furnaces
[49:26] but do you know what kind of furnaces
[49:32] they were gold smelting furnaces
[49:36] they were made to Smite to smelt the
[49:39] gold that was used for the Statue
[49:44] gold melts
[49:47] at
[49:49] 1948 degrees
[49:54] but that wasn't hot enough
[50:01] I gotta get that furnace harder
[50:04] temperatures
[50:32] foreign
[51:19] [Music]
[51:29] [Music]
[51:31] thirteen thousand degrees is
[51:37] the three young men understood
[51:41] there's only one thing that runs at 13
[51:44] 000 degrees
[51:47] and that is the core of the earth yes
[51:55] [Music]
[51:57] and I knew it had to be heated seven
[52:01] times
[52:26] [Music]
[52:31] it's just about right right now
[52:34] [Music]
[52:35] I can feel myself going out
[52:40] I can feel the heat of the Holy ghosts
[52:46] just about right now
[52:55] thought he was doing something
[52:57] incredible
[52:59] so he says throw them in the furnace
[53:03] and when he throws them in the first
[53:10] they go in Three Men
[53:13] and they look again
[53:16] and it even Nebuchadnezzar
[53:20] who had studied the word of God
[53:23] because when he saw the Fourth Man
[53:28] when he saw that first man
[53:31] wow
[53:53] [Music]
[54:03] it wasn't by chance
[54:07] it wasn't just a coincidence that they
[54:09] ended up in a furnace
[54:12] they created the situation
[54:17] in which the Holy Ghost
[54:21] as the Son of God
[54:24] could be made manifests
[54:27] in their very days
[54:31] ahead of his scheduled time
[54:38] [Music]
[54:45] [Music]
[55:05] [Music]
[55:06] they drew him to himself
[55:15] I'm sorry for those of you sitting in
[55:16] the front row
[55:19] that's the Splash Zone
[55:23] so I apologize
[55:28] but they created
[55:31] an environment
[55:54] [Music]
[56:21] your dispensation
[56:24] that was a time of God above us
[56:27] sovereign
[56:42] [Music]
[57:13] [Music]
[57:34] is the Hope wow
[57:57] come on Amen
[57:58] brother Branham makes a statement mono
[58:00] Branham this says though and he says the
[58:03] sickest body
[58:05] is the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:09] but you know if you only take that so
[58:12] far you lose half the revelations
[58:18] because if I take that statement
[58:21] and I say it's the body of the Lord
[58:24] Jesus Christ out there
[58:29] I haven't recognized my day in its
[58:32] message
[58:34] but when I look at it
[58:37] and I say this body is the sickest body
[58:44] then it changes the whole entire Outlook
[58:50] because now I'm looking inwardly
[58:54] the Bible says let every man
[58:59] examine everybody else around him
[59:05] no sir no Senor the Bible says let every
[59:09] man a woman a child
[59:12] examine ourselves
[59:14] [Music]
[59:16] let us all check ourselves
[59:25] that's what Paul is so tremendous
[59:29] because you hear people say
[59:32] I remember the day that I died
[59:36] and as tremendous as that is
[59:40] my question to that is simply this is
[1:00:09] [Music]
[1:00:23] some new situation in my life
[1:00:27] that does not line up with God
[1:00:31] that will not produce the desired result
[1:00:34] [Music]
[1:00:36] and when I find that
[1:00:39] so I die that day
[1:00:42] and then tomorrow I'll find something
[1:00:44] else
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:01:07] but Christ still lives
[1:01:12] then I don't do and don't says what I
[1:01:16] want to do look at your kiddo I do what
[1:01:19] is necessary
[1:01:21] to produce the desired results
[1:01:32] the person of Jesus Christ
[1:01:39] to manifest the life that he lives
[1:01:47] yes esto is Jesus Christ
[1:01:51] the only difference
[1:01:53] is today he's wearing this suit
[1:01:59] I did not
[1:02:01] praise the Lord amen can we produce
[1:02:05] the desired results
[1:02:12] forgive me for screaming
[1:02:16] I just get excited
[1:02:21] this is life is the spirit is
[1:02:29] this is our day
[1:02:31] this is our dispensation
[1:02:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:02:39] each and every one of you chose
[1:02:42] because you understood
[1:02:45] just like Shadrach Meshach
[1:02:50] that in the seventh Church age and lost
[1:02:55] yeah cooked Seven Seals
[1:02:58] that there was seven trumpets
[1:03:02] that there was seven angels that would
[1:03:04] show themselves in the clouds
[1:03:08] and even though you can't remember
[1:03:20] because I see the desired results
[1:03:24] being produced in a way
[1:03:27] that it had never been produced before
[1:03:35] and we stood there you said before the
[1:03:38] foundation of the world
[1:03:40] and we said all those Seven Seals it is
[1:03:45] how those Mysteries oh it says
[1:03:48] mysterious they were hidden
[1:03:50] Escondidos oh I can see them start to
[1:03:53] unfold in that day
[1:03:56] oh that's seventh messenger oh it says
[1:04:04] Jesus told Peter Jesus
[1:04:07] Upon This Rock sobre esta Piedra I built
[1:04:11] my church yes
[1:04:13] but when we hear it
[1:04:16] we always think of a stone cold dead
[1:04:19] lifeless rocks
[1:04:23] but that's not the rock Jesus was
[1:04:25] talking about
[1:04:28] he was referring
[1:04:30] the 13 000 degrees
[1:04:45] because it doesn't matter who I get
[1:04:48] around
[1:04:49] it doesn't matter who I get around uh
[1:04:55] if I get around a brother who's called
[1:04:58] say yes
[1:05:03] it doesn't matter
[1:05:06] because I've got molten lava
[1:05:10] I've got love of the Holy ghosts
[1:05:15] it's gonna ignite my brother
[1:05:18] it doesn't matter
[1:05:20] where I go I don't know because I'm not
[1:05:24] afraid
[1:05:25] because upon the rock of Revelations
[1:05:32] I stand upon that rock um
[1:05:38] amen
[1:05:40] and we are able it's almost capacity to
[1:05:44] produce the producer the desired result
[1:05:48] for Our Generation
[1:05:51] for our dispensation
[1:05:54] we are able to Worship
[1:05:57] in spirit and a spiritual and in truth
[1:06:01] we are able to call
[1:06:04] that same Messiah that the Shadrach
[1:06:07] Meshach and Abednego I said
[1:06:10] able to bring him on the scene
[1:06:14] just like they did
[1:06:17] so why then do we walk around
[1:06:22] as defeated broke down Christians
[1:06:29] it's because we've never recognized
[1:06:33] what lives inside of each and every
[1:06:35] morning
[1:06:37] Nosotros you've never been able to see
[1:06:42] that core that's inside of it is
[1:06:45] hot and churning and going Caliente is
[1:06:50] just anxious to spread the love of Jesus
[1:06:53] Christ
[1:06:56] but it's time
[1:06:58] it's high time
[1:07:02] that we bring God out of History
[1:07:08] it's high time
[1:07:11] that we live in our distance
[1:07:15] that we worship in our district
[1:07:20] and that we become
[1:07:24] a manifested son or daughter of God
[1:07:29] to a Dying World
[1:07:32] it's nobody else's problem
[1:07:36] it's mine and yours
[1:07:39] that's why we're here
[1:07:44] may God bless you

[1:14:56] that exercise Authority upon them are

[1:16:55] not only does it does it hinder us in
[1:16:58] our natural life
[1:17:01] but it hinders us in our spiritual life
[1:17:06] I've seen so often times
[1:17:10] where where there's people
[1:17:13] that have that have served the Lord
[1:17:17] or that that have come to church I
[1:17:20] should say okay

[1:18:05] Mesa isn't that what Jesus is saying
[1:18:07] isn't isn't the one that is being served
[1:18:09] greater Jesus
[1:18:12] he says but I am among You parody
[1:18:17] as he
[1:18:21] but imagine one thing
[1:18:25] God in flesh and carne
[1:18:29] he came in a way
[1:18:32] that the Sadducees
[1:18:35] that the Pharisees
[1:18:37] they were so blinded
[1:18:40] or I should say maybe they were so
[1:18:42] blindsided
[1:18:45] at the way that Jesus came
[1:18:49] you know they expected
[1:18:52] a man to come okay
[1:18:55] sit on the throne
[1:18:57] people waving palms and make sure he's
[1:19:00] he's all right and cool Las personas
[1:19:06] they expected somebody that was royalty
[1:19:12] but what they got
[1:19:14] you was just a humble man serving
[1:19:22] oh my goodness
[1:19:26] so many times muchas versus you know I
[1:19:29] remember growing up
[1:19:30] I had a bad complex
[1:19:37] and I want to share something personal
[1:19:39] with you this morning that's all right
[1:19:46] you know when you're when you're at
[1:19:48] somebody's house you know when I go to
[1:19:49] brother Carlos's house
[1:19:53] I take off my shoes
[1:19:56] you know I I put the couch back a little
[1:19:59] bit
[1:20:01] it gets served some iced tea
[1:20:04] he makes me feel at home
[1:20:09] but that's the way that we feel here but
[1:20:12] uh
[1:20:13] we can just be ourselves this morning so
[1:20:20] growing up Crescendo I had a I had a
[1:20:23] complex
[1:20:24] I had a complex well my dad's the
[1:20:27] pasture
[1:20:29] so whatever you give to the pastor
[1:20:34] well that should be given to me as well
[1:20:42] imagine that
[1:20:44] you've served the pasture Pastor hey hey
[1:20:48] it's my dad that's me papa
[1:20:50] you serve me as well
[1:20:52] so there I go Antonio a big shot right
[1:20:56] Persona Grande everybody knows who my
[1:20:59] dad is
[1:21:00] what's your dad's name again
[1:21:26] of yes
[1:21:28] I want to be servedo
[1:21:34] but I never realized
[1:21:37] and I never saw
[1:21:42] or I shouldn't say I never saw but I I
[1:21:44] was blinded by my own by my own thoughts
[1:21:51] I wouldn't would see my dad in a certain
[1:21:55] way
[1:21:56] but when he would go on the missionary
[1:21:58] film
[1:22:00] and he was there with people
[1:22:03] in all hours of the morning
[1:22:06] in a hospital
[1:22:10] the way
[1:22:12] he served
[1:22:16] you know sometimes we see great
[1:22:18] ministers
[1:22:20] and we see him in a certain light
[1:22:23] we see him in a certain way
[1:22:26] but we have no idea sometimes
[1:22:31] what they go through to serve God's
[1:22:33] people
[1:22:36] you know that's what Jesus was trying to
[1:22:38] get to the disciples
[1:22:42] he even brought in our little child
[1:22:45] we're going to go to uh Mark 9 33.3
[1:22:58] we'll actually go with verse 36.
[1:23:03] then he took a child
[1:23:06] and set him set him in the midst of them
[1:23:10] and when he had taken him in his arms
[1:23:13] he said unto them whosoever
[1:23:18] shall receive one of such children in my
[1:23:21] name is
[1:23:27] and whosoever shall receive me
[1:23:31] receiveth not me
[1:23:34] but him
[1:23:36] that sent me Manville
[1:23:40] what a thing it is once again
[1:23:44] for God in flesh
[1:23:47] to serve his people
[1:23:51] you know what it brings me to something
[1:23:56] a few years ago
[1:23:58] I was I was uh I was reading in the book
[1:24:03] of Isaiah and we could turn to it right
[1:24:06] now
[1:24:08] the book of Isaiah chapter 40.
[1:24:11] verse 31.
[1:24:21] and I read this and I I this was one of
[1:24:24] the first
[1:24:26] um first scriptures
[1:24:28] that my uh that I remember as as as a
[1:24:33] boy
[1:24:38] that my mother taught me
[1:24:42] [Music]
[1:24:43] and it reads that reads like this
[1:24:47] but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:24:50] shall renew their strength
[1:24:53] they shall Mount up with wings as eagles
[1:24:57] they shall run and not be weary
[1:25:00] and they shall walk and not think
[1:25:03] and I remember reading that
[1:25:06] the Lord brought this to my attention
[1:25:10] and I read it and I said but they that
[1:25:13] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[1:25:15] strength
[1:25:18] wow that's awesome
[1:25:23] thank you Lord
[1:25:28] foreign
[1:25:40] because that's not it it is you're not
[1:25:43] you're you're not catching what I'm
[1:25:45] trying to show you
[1:25:48] I want you to read it slow
[1:25:52] and I want you to change the perspective
[1:25:55] that you see of this scripture
[1:26:01] so he says read it slow yeah he said
[1:26:04] he says but they that wait upon and he
[1:26:08] said stop
[1:26:11] that's the only part I want you to see
[1:26:13] is
[1:26:15] but they that weighed upon ah
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:48] I said a waiter
[1:26:52] my
[1:26:54] so then I look at it again and my
[1:26:57] perspective changes
[1:27:00] because so many times
[1:27:02] we're waiting
[1:27:04] for the Lord to do something
[1:27:07] and not realizing
[1:27:10] why we are so weak
[1:27:12] why we have no strength
[1:27:16] because what happens we're in the bench
[1:27:21] give me the word
[1:27:23] ministry give me the words
[1:27:32] and the Lord is trying to tell you
[1:27:37] that wait upon
[1:27:40] so check this out
[1:27:43] when you wait upon something
[1:27:46] it's to serve
[1:27:48] it's to ministers
[1:27:51] to someone
[1:27:54] that has personal needs
[1:27:58] so here you go
[1:28:00] you see who said the scripture again and
[1:28:04] you say Lord you say senor how am I
[1:28:07] going to renew my strength
[1:28:10] so many times
[1:28:12] the doctor will say okay in order for
[1:28:16] you to get strength
[1:28:18] you need to go on bed rest
[1:28:20] you need to relax
[1:28:22] just Netflix and chill for a while
[1:28:26] but God what God is telling you
[1:28:29] he's not telling you to just stay in the
[1:28:33] bench
[1:28:34] but what he's showing you is to wait
[1:28:38] upon
[1:28:43] so when you see your brother when you
[1:28:46] see him in need
[1:28:51] what can I do for you
[1:28:55] what can I do to wait upon you
[1:28:58] know there's something wonderful
[1:29:04] when you're at your lowest
[1:29:07] when you're at your weakest
[1:29:10] God wants you to serve
[1:29:17] D it's rough brother
[1:29:19] it's rough as the face seal says okay it
[1:29:24] is okay you have problems this is
[1:29:27] probably one of the one of the greatest
[1:29:28] things I've I've learned from Brother
[1:29:29] Calum
[1:29:33] is that you have problems
[1:29:35] I said yeah I have problems see go visit
[1:29:38] somebody baby
[1:29:48] but but I'm looking for counseling
[1:29:49] brother
[1:29:52] go visit somebody
[1:29:54] you have issues go visit somebody
[1:29:59] try and serve somebody for for a change
[1:30:07] we learned about that this morning
[1:30:12] feel like pastors pastors condemning me
[1:30:14] now
[1:30:16] but that's how you realize
[1:30:19] if you truly have the Holy Ghost
[1:30:24] it's how you react
[1:30:27] to correction
[1:30:31] right whoo
[1:30:35] but here's the problem sometimes
[1:30:39] we all want to be Eagles right
[1:30:42] that's our goal right
[1:30:45] the prophet says we're liking to Eagles
[1:30:49] but I've realized in life
[1:30:52] there's a lot of ostriches here
[1:31:02] it's a bird
[1:31:04] right it's a bird
[1:31:11] but I asked I asked my uh my family
[1:31:14] what's what's the difference between an
[1:31:17] oxygen and an eagle family
[1:31:21] right off the baton one can fly
[1:31:27] yeah that's exactly right
[1:31:33] you see the ostrich
[1:31:37] the ostrich has
[1:31:39] what it takes
[1:31:41] to fly
[1:31:44] oh my God
[1:31:45] it has one of the largest wingspans of
[1:31:48] any birds
[1:31:52] but it also has
[1:31:55] the largest body of any birds
[1:31:59] so so my thinking is
[1:32:03] well an eagle can fly
[1:32:07] an ostrich
[1:32:09] they weigh about 300 pounds or so uh
[1:32:13] Libras
[1:32:15] but why doesn't it want to fly
[1:32:20] it has the ability to but doesn't want
[1:32:22] to
[1:32:26] and I looked in the spiritual aspect of
[1:32:28] a straw of an ostrich
[1:32:32] if if for years
[1:32:37] you have listened to the message
[1:32:41] and you have been served so much
[1:32:48] what happens
[1:32:50] what you want to you want the pastor to
[1:32:53] do everything for you
[1:32:55] so after a while
[1:32:58] the wings that God has given you

[1:33:21] what's that
[1:33:22] you become spiritually chunky
[1:33:27] you become spiritually obese

[1:33:34] and you're eating and year after year he
[1:33:40] says well I'm waiting on the Lord
[1:33:44] praise the Lord he's coming
[1:33:50] ah and what happens

[1:33:58] he said well I'm supposed to be an eagle
[1:34:03] wow brother
[1:34:05] you've been served too long
[1:34:10] you know it's time
[1:34:13] it's time Brothers
[1:34:16] with all the word that has been spoken
[1:34:22] all the word that has been consumed by
[1:34:25] us
[1:34:27] it's time to start serving
[1:34:32] brother sister hermana don't get
[1:34:36] complacent uh
[1:34:39] don't get relaxed and just because oh
[1:34:44] it's so good to to be a Christian
[1:34:47] I know I've accepted the message
[1:34:51] oh God is so good to me
[1:34:54] he's blessed me and we get relaxed
[1:35:00] we get complacents
[1:35:03] and then instead of eagles
[1:35:06] we start acting like ostriches
[1:35:11] oh my goodness
[1:35:13] [Music]
[1:35:15] brother Brandon says when God
[1:35:18] has called a person for a job to do
[1:35:24] there is no one that can take its place
[1:35:29] that's right amen yes
[1:35:33] there is no one that can take your place
[1:35:38] you are peculiar
[1:35:43] he says how often I have wondered
[1:35:47] how I would like to take oral Robert's
[1:35:49] Place
[1:35:51] how I would like to take Billy Graham's
[1:35:54] Place
[1:35:58] go speak to an audience of people
[1:36:02] call centers
[1:36:05] forget it and go home
[1:36:08] not have to stand there
[1:36:11] and wrestle again
[1:36:14] I cannot be Billy Graham Billy Graham
[1:36:17] but neither can Billy Graham be mean
[1:36:21] or we are both
[1:36:24] I cannot be Oral Roberts all the robbers
[1:36:27] cannot be mean Oral Roberts or robbers
[1:36:30] you're each one
[1:36:32] set in God's economy
[1:36:36] just for its place
[1:36:40] won fast all the time and communes with
[1:36:42] God
[1:36:45] while another one casts out devil
[1:36:48] because this one is fasting
[1:36:53] but it's the whole body of Christ
[1:36:58] working together
[1:37:03] imagine that for for a minute
[1:37:07] the body of Christ working together
[1:37:13] when we see these denominational
[1:37:16] barriers breaking us up
[1:37:20] and if I can bring that into our two
[1:37:23] hour time
[1:37:26] when we see these Malachi 4 5 barriers
[1:37:30] breaking us up
[1:37:34] we didn't have to look at the at the
[1:37:37] denominations anymore
[1:37:39] that's what hurts my heart
[1:37:42] because that's the thing that separates
[1:37:45] separates us
[1:37:47] there is no big people among us
[1:37:51] there's no great people among us
[1:37:55] we are all the same todos
[1:38:00] you know
[1:38:02] when we were in Uganda
[1:38:05] Uganda
[1:38:06] when you preach the matches when you
[1:38:08] preach a message like this
[1:38:12] that we are all the same
[1:38:15] it blows their mind
[1:38:19] because there are so many people that
[1:38:21] are looked down upon
[1:38:25] just because we're from America doesn't
[1:38:27] mean we're better
[1:38:33] just because we have the revelation of
[1:38:35] of who our of who our Prophet is
[1:38:42] that doesn't make us any better
[1:38:45] he says there is only one great Among Us
[1:38:49] you know there's no Fort Collins bride
[1:38:52] foreign
[1:39:01] [Music]
[1:39:06] how many are happy to be called The
[1:39:09] Bride Novia
[1:39:14] he says we must recognize him
[1:39:18] and if we seek honor is one from another
[1:39:23] we can't have faith
[1:39:25] because we are having faith in one
[1:39:28] another
[1:39:31] we got to have faith in Christ
[1:39:36] he is the one he is the one Among Us
[1:39:40] that we must have faith
[1:39:43] and then faith in what he is doing and
[1:39:46] has to give us
[1:39:49] now no one could take Moses's place
[1:39:55] no matter how much he ran
[1:40:02] wow brother Alex doesn't matter how much
[1:40:05] I ran
[1:40:07] because I want to tell you something
[1:40:09] again personally
[1:40:12] being behind a Pulpit I started was the
[1:40:16] last thing in my life that I ever wanted
[1:40:20] this was the last place I wanted to be
[1:40:25] care they asked me why you're going to
[1:40:27] be a preacher because your your grandpa
[1:40:29] was a preacher your dad is a preacher is
[1:40:36] your uncles are preachers
[1:40:39] your brothers are preachers
[1:40:41] and I said well that's fine
[1:40:44] I ain't gonna be a preacher
[1:40:49] no matter how much I ran
[1:40:53] I want to make this uh this uh this um
[1:40:57] this this paragraph here a little
[1:40:58] personal to me okay
[1:41:00] [Music]
[1:41:02] and you take it personal as well
[1:41:05] no matter how much Iran
[1:41:09] and no matter how much I tried to get
[1:41:12] away from it
[1:41:14] yet God knows what he is doing
[1:41:19] he knowed just what he had to take
[1:41:24] and make out of Williams
[1:41:28] these things had to happen
[1:41:33] no one could take William's place
[1:41:39] but just because no one could take my
[1:41:43] place
[1:41:45] does not give me the rights
[1:41:50] or the reason
[1:41:52] to feel that I am greater than anybody

[2:13:20] we are happy with the Lord
[2:13:24] those who wait upon the Lord
[2:13:30] seen a good waiter
[2:13:33] being a good waiter
[2:13:36] hey
[2:13:38] they're not waiting for you to ask them
[2:13:41] for more water

[2:13:46] we're waiting for the song leader to say
[2:13:49] something to do something
[2:13:52] waiting for the preachers
[2:13:55] give glory to God but a good waiter
[2:14:35] he deserves it
[2:14:40] wait upon the Lord significa means to be
[2:14:45] a good servant significant To Be
[2:14:49] watchful
[2:14:51] what else does my Lord need
[2:14:54] what else does my savior need what does
[2:14:58] he want from me
[2:15:03] that's how we should be
[2:15:06] waiting upon the Lord does it mean
[2:15:11] not doing anything
[2:15:14] no waiting upon the Lord
[2:15:19] means that you're watching okay
[2:15:21] what does he desire of me
[2:15:24] when he knocks at the door of my heart
[2:15:26] what does he want me to do
[2:15:29] I'm here
[2:15:32] to the answer to your call no
[2:15:36] have you ever seen those bad Waiters
[2:15:39] that you try to wave them down
[2:15:42] they're over there talking with their
[2:15:44] co-workers
[2:15:46] they don't even realize
[2:15:49] when somebody is needing them
[2:15:52] I believe that's how God is
[2:15:56] calling and calling and calling
[2:15:59] speaks and he speaks and speaks to us
[2:16:01] and we just ignore them
[2:16:06] but those that wait upon the Lord
[2:16:09] those that are already in willing to
[2:16:12] serve him
[2:16:14] to do something for him okay
[2:16:18] although it would be the dorm out of the
[2:16:20] church but to do something for him
[2:16:24] they shall receive new Strength
[2:16:27] she'll lift up their wings like eagles
[2:16:35] oh that's what I want to be okay
[2:16:40] he says the word to my heart
[2:16:43] you know
[2:16:47] the more I walk in the ways of God
[2:16:50] the more sensitive I am to his voice
[2:16:55] I don't want him to yell at me
[2:17:00] I want to hear his thoughts and his
[2:17:01] desires
[2:17:06] they don't get excited
[2:17:09] when they hear the voice of God
[2:17:11] they've heard it so much perhaps
[2:17:14] perhaps they've heard it so much
[2:17:17] they don't get excited
[2:17:20] they want him to do spoken about greatly
[2:17:24] spoken of great Revelations to be spoken
[2:17:26] so that they could get excited so that
[2:17:29] they would answer
[2:17:31] but I don't want to be that way
[2:17:37] I wonder even if he speaks the most
[2:17:38] simple things
[2:17:40] even if he just speaks of Amazing Grace
[2:17:43] that my heart would answer to his voice
[2:17:46] [Music]
[2:17:52] I'm the one that was lost
[2:17:56] and it's only by his grace
[2:18:01] I want to get excited look Brothers I
[2:18:04] want to get excited
[2:18:06] with just knowing that his presence is
[2:18:10] in this place
[2:18:15] I don't want to be those Christians
[2:18:21] nothing makes him glorify God
[2:18:40] [Applause]
[2:18:45] has been able to separate me
[2:18:49] from your hand
[2:18:54] those that wait upon the Lord
[2:18:57] those are sensitive to his voice
[2:19:00] that are listening
