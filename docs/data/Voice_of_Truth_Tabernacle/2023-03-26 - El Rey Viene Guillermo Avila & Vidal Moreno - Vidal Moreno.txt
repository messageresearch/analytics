Elijah the prophet they sayaki yours Prophet Elias in English in English it says Spanish in Spanish says it goes directly to you it is [Music] because it's not for everyone not everyone is going to receive he was sent to you amen amen that's why we're happy if we got up this morning with food in our homes with health but it's almost when they see those other than we're blessed you've given us so much and this morning we come to your house to hear you so you can help us place the service in your hands place myself at the end of this discussion that we can be able to leave like those walking on the road these words that you place that in us the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated and those is a and in the last week it was split into two amen amen the Forerunner is someone who points so then he told us are you guys [Music] or how many were watching a movie this is uh correct so the right time to plan now you have to have the right time even when you go and buy your seeds at Walmart it gives you a certain time and that's the the time frame you have to sewing if you plant them before then you're not going to reap anything the Lord knows the Bible says [Music] foreign because there was something in you amen amen um when he came to Rahab and foreign how did he find Rahab she was a prostitute amen she lived with other men she wasn't a wife she was a harlot and when uh Joshua came here and he spoke the message she believed it amen amen and when she believed she accepted the message she accepted the message amen amen this is the mouth of God so there's a time to sew scripture [Music] is that he always came to women that weren't living a very good life is uh foreign [Music] that's what the Lord looks at amen amen yeah now this precursor he comes and gives a significant what is going on here is the second coming of the Lord this is like this um this is signs of his coming the prophecies oh it's a great day that we're now living in different earthquakes places pestilence Jesus all those things that Jesus spoke of is here he says to my way of seeing it I don't see anything left when I hear people say oh it can't happen he says I don't see anything left but the coming of the Lord is at hand amen amen how many believe your brothers how many love is coming how many are waiting for is coming are you ready how are you this evening would you be ready I I heard when they asked my mother that question and they asked are you ready she had to be sure she had to be a hundred percent she couldn't have a shadow of a doubt that she was ready for us this morning are we ready Brothers amen seniority I'm waiting for you amen amen the scripture says there in Luke Chapter 15. this is either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece peace does not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it this is in those days the woman didn't use a ring what she used was a was a necklace or she used a crown she had a medals she had coins on her crown so when she did something that was incorrect is when the people seen that that woman was found in adults or that she was gossiping correct I thought she was done doing something in Korea they brought her before the priest and the priest if it was true what had happened would remove a coin from her from her crap amen amen those were the vows tourists she took that coin he took that coin amen amen Dishonored her husband Lord have mercy the prophet says we've almost lost all of our coins we've about lost all of our coins but the fruit of the spirit is how many of us has lost love a tremendous message and he said love your enemies Brothers we can't love the one who loves us and he cursed it foreign do we have something loose predicador [Music] could you imagine coming in at nighttime tired weary worn if you're a farmer mechanic preacher usted yoga whatever you are come in and when you get into your little home it is you long until you can get there you open the door and the sweet little wife stands there yeah she greets you she's all prettied up and cleaned up she walks over and kisses you on the cheek and she says Dad you're tired Ness she sits you down in a chair she sits herself down on your lap rasa okay she puts her arms around you and she patches you it's just like seems like that you're not tired something picks you up it's something that God gave you this is what he gave a woman for amen it's a part of you this is may the Lord bless you [Applause] bendiga God bless you are happy uh let's open up our scriptures um the the Lucas to the Book of Luke said is a Lucas to Luke chapter three um how many are happy Luke 3 2 says being the high priest the word of God came unto unto John the son of Zachary Zacharias Zacharias in the wilderness I want you to notice here yeah there were the priests at that time but the word didn't come to them the scripture says that the word came to John amen amen God does things in a strange way [Music] to God for that he has a strange message he also has a strange group of people that they're unique identification and they identified with a message that is very unique as well amen amen uh [Music] El profeta [Music] as it is written in the prophets behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare the thy way before thee he said um and the following scripture says the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his path straight I think that when one goes ahead in Europe it's not a very easy job I think he could identify with his college because when I've shared a little with my children I share that when sometimes when you have plans the one who's preparing a party or a wedding event or any kind of a great event it you see that in the olden times when you were prepared for the coming of a king [Music] I don't know foreign amen amen the Messiah it says Like This is Gospel ain't going to shake the world the church has been shook like it never has been before this is supposed to shake the world they're dead and the people say why did why doesn't the world hear it it's not for everyone this message the message that's criticized but a message I guess the greater things amen Brothers I believe that and when you're criticized I imagine John knew what criticism was [Music] you know what criticism was because in his times [Music] and how we dress ourselves with religions John came dresses he wasn't dressed in religion so then John was criticized and look at this it's implicit you didn't have to dress a certain way how the religious world of that day to be recognized by God amen amen ities Brothers entonces he was simply happy with being the voice concerns we're simply being the voice he didn't care he didn't care just uh being the voice just being the voice of God God gives us nothing else someone is preparing the ground the president of the United States would have come to Fort Collins in our terms he was evening things out it's located that's what he did it was a rugged job that was very rugged and it was so rugged that when John is when he was preaching on the edge of the Jewish go into the Seas to preachers what God was doing there come and see uh something spectacular foreign Jesus said that they went to see because they were only going to see they weren't here with a message for absolutely all of us I believe it God help us Brothers the job that John had her brother Guillermo expressed how it is that when you open up when you when you till or plow the soil um that's the most difficult part is it's the most difficult part it's a message the message being a forerunner it made the people uncomfortable it was a very uncomfortable message foreign [Applause] we all needed [Music] that's where it was that's where John came from and that's why uh very special job for you very special job a job that is that is painful because when you're different you believe in a message that's different it comes with a lot of Solitude a lot of solitude over there in the desert and I imagine as a young man he was maybe playing with uh with the snakes we didn't have a lot of toys station didn't have a PlayStation he didn't have an iPhone and sometimes we're crying because we don't have the most recent things amen amen yes and the message he was hurting Brothers he was plowing he was plowing he was plowing the Earth he put in some businesses although we know that the seed we know it was already planted but there are many things don't worry do something for him yeah that's what John did yesterday and I'm closing with this is sometimes it feels when we work yes [Music] when someone is working for God my business there are times that there's disappointment I imagine our pastor it feels disappointment sometimes when the people don't listen when the people aren't working when he's giving his all yeah and he gets here and the people aren't doing anything you can throw in the towel at any time but he has to attend to a colleague there to the word and it's time we get up in the mornings you're not going to be successful every time not even Jesus was successful in all things Brothers and the scripture says that he couldn't do anything in some places because of the unbelief that was there that's scriptural Brothers God knew looked what it was like to not be successful you're not successful you won't be successful in all things and John wasn't always successful and when the people came in in their hearts or just criticizing people laughing at it and inviting everyone he didn't even call himself a prophet one day he got up in the morning [Music] and they're at the Jordan River baptizing the people you go Uno there came one this is and the scripture says the scripture says that heaven and a Dove came down lord Jesus Christ he said here am I or he behold here's the Lamb of God you've been criticized he knows what you need the correct time correct in the right season what God can do you just accept it because the king yes he sent a message it's all been revealed that John bro but I said for that time explicitly expressing the thoughts of God I believe that that's what God wants to do is when you prepare yourself [Music] all things work for the good thank you [Music] what is fear the office the episodes [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] episode [Music]
