[28:58] [Music]
[29:13] Matthew chapter 6 verse 21
[29:18] what a beautiful song
[29:26] I hope that their heart that sounds like
[29:29] our hearts and prepare us
[29:32] for what God has for us this morning
[29:34] okay
[29:39] the Holy Ghost descends
[29:45] it reads like this
[29:48] is
[29:52] for where your treasure is
[29:55] there will your heart be also
[30:04] you may be seated
[30:08] este
[30:11] Pastore
[30:13] with our pastor replace the title
[30:17] let go to obtain
[30:20] is
[30:26] I believe we're living in a Time donde
[30:32] where we've been offered very much
[30:36] it's made it very difficult
[30:39] to let go of things because they're nice
[30:43] things
[30:45] that the devil offers us
[30:48] they're nice things
[30:52] I believe that the devil offers us on
[30:54] this earth
[30:56] that is his job
[30:58] but I also believe
[31:02] everything on this Earth
[31:31] we're gonna go in little by little
[31:37] to begin
[31:44] where is my heart
[31:48] where is my heart
[31:50] this is the side of my heart
[31:54] if you ask yourself
[32:11] what's your heart
[32:20] he wants to live in our hearts
[32:24] and what the devil is
[32:31] where we make our choice
[32:36] [Music]
[32:51] that's what moves us
[32:53] that's what moves
[33:02] now when God sees that Brothers
[33:05] when God sees that
[33:08] is
[33:09] God is a very jealous
[33:13] now God is
[33:15] because God loves it
[33:19] in that such a way
[33:23] we have to make our choice
[33:31] what God has for me
[33:33] amen Brothers okay okay
[33:37] let's read a little bit
[33:40] in the Book of Matthew
[33:44] chapter 19.
[33:46] foreign
[33:54] we're going to read verses 19 and 20.
[34:01] this is the story of the Russian rules
[34:13] I believe that there's something inside
[34:15] of this
[34:17] is
[34:22] a young man
[34:28] this is
[34:39] he was a religious person
[34:44] um
[34:46] uh
[34:49] he was somebody who was content who was
[34:51] happy
[34:52] [Applause]
[34:55] but within him then
[34:58] within him there was a void there was an
[35:00] Empire
[35:02] emptiness inside of this young man
[35:05] when he explained to us they
[35:12] imagine of every time he hurts
[35:16] got something within his heart
[35:21] a desire to know
[35:24] I believe that within history
[35:28] that he wanted something
[35:31] he had to realize yeah
[36:06] Nosotros
[36:13] we could feel underst we could feel a
[36:17] rest
[36:18] yes
[36:20] that is why we come together foreign
[37:25] this young man had a reverence
[37:29] he was a sincere man
[37:37] because he felt empty or he felt that
[37:41] fall he felt guilty meet him now look
[37:44] Brothers
[37:52] he's speaking of we're speaking of a
[37:54] purpose that is the theme
[38:07] all of this is going to pass away
[38:10] all of this will pass away
[38:13] of course we need it
[38:21] they have to have contacts
[38:23] but this isn't what's going to give us
[38:25] eternal life
[38:33] eternal life is
[38:41] [Applause]
[38:46] because this young man was given the
[38:48] opportunity
[38:55] amen Brothers
[39:07] but he had a great
[39:10] problems
[39:13] because we all have problems
[39:54] but not just because we care for them
[39:56] does it mean that we have to obtains no
[39:58] brothers
[40:03] this young man
[40:06] he came to the Lord Jesus
[40:10] he
[40:13] and when he heard
[40:16] now you know brothers
[40:20] that God searches our hearts
[40:23] right see yes
[40:27] God is searching our hearts this morning
[40:32] in my heart this morning
[40:34] foreign
[41:30] [Applause]
[41:51] [Music]
[41:59] all of my heart
[42:53] it makes me happy like the word of God
[42:56] does amen
[43:15] I tell it to you from the bottom of my
[43:17] heart yes
[43:23] they make me suffer Brothers
[43:26] I cry more
[43:28] yeah
[43:31] you're on and I'm a crybaby as it is
[43:38] brother Samuel says if you see the kids
[43:40] are crying baby you go over there
[43:44] I'm very sentimental
[43:48] glorious and glory to God Brothers
[43:54] but now when the Lord Jesus Christ told
[43:56] us your man
[43:58] he was searching his heart
[44:01] [Music]
[44:03] he had seen what was uh what was
[44:06] hindering him
[44:07] and he told
[44:09] us
[44:10] you've done everything
[44:13] Cristiano you're a good Christian
[44:16] s
[44:26] i sweep my mom for the church
[44:29] I cook
[44:34] [Music]
[44:36] I am so ready
[44:39] come take me Lord I am so tired
[44:48] I'm also sleepy
[44:51] Hermanos
[44:55] if you want to be asleep
[44:58] and not wake up
[45:00] there's a reality
[45:11] amen Brothers now look
[45:17] when God searched this young man's heart
[45:21] he told him Let It Go
[45:23] es
[45:25] now perhaps for this young man
[45:31] it was his reputation
[45:35] how he was going to give everything in
[45:37] and um
[45:48] abundance Brothers
[45:52] sometimes we think that when we give a
[45:55] thousand dollars
[46:03] when the Son of God gives God gives you
[46:06] a double
[46:08] when Elijah
[46:11] when Elijah Brothers
[46:19] and when you give to God God gives you
[46:22] more
[46:24] that is our God
[46:28] now
[46:30] you is only you can see your heart
[46:37] you know what you're struggling with
[46:41] it
[46:43] and that is what God wants you to let go
[46:45] of it
[46:47] you guys giving us the opportunity this
[46:49] morning to let it go
[46:52] but God is not going to force you meet
[46:54] it
[46:56] God love this young man
[47:00] God loves you this morning
[47:11] God loves me
[47:14] it's important it's important to know
[47:17] that Brothers
[47:18] to know that God loves us
[47:22] but God wants us to let go
[47:25] to be able to obtain that's right
[47:32] what he possessed
[47:35] was what possessed him
[47:39] what he possessed
[47:42] was what possessed him
[47:45] do you see brothers look
[47:49] at me what binds me is what I don't want
[47:54] to let go of it's looking
[47:57] that's what kills me
[47:59] is but the word of God says
[48:03] it's time to let it go let it goes and
[48:09] I've decided to let it goes
[48:12] to let go of all of this world
[48:17] to let it all go
[48:21] it's worth it
[48:24] God called you to be a leader
[48:26] and God sent you
[48:29] Bruno
[50:01] in the ninth hour
[50:08] there was a crippled man there from
[50:10] birth a lame man
[50:13] ero he was asking for money
[50:24] they looked into his eyes
[50:27] and they kept looking at him
[50:31] dinero they didn't have money
[50:40] had the Holy Ghost
[50:44] had everything inside
[50:48] that they offered this young man
[50:57] Brothers
[51:20] why do we go so far
[51:22] that is what I need
[51:27] Gloria glory to God Brothers
[51:31] meeting look
[51:34] at I'm going to finish with this
[51:37] and the message straight is the gate he
[51:40] said
[51:44] no I know that you think that I'm a hard
[51:46] person
[51:47] I'm not hard brother Brown
[51:50] I'm your brother and I love you
[51:55] you see that's what God does
[51:57] that God shows us his love
[52:20] so we should do the same
[52:22] this is
[52:30] an anger that was pure amen they say
[52:34] this is
[52:35] I love you this is
[52:39] the Wrath that is
[52:42] go to the cross
[52:46] and cry until your heart is
[53:09] Christ is not a duty
[53:13] it's a lot of services
[54:06] so God has foreign
[54:34] foreign
[54:49] [Applause]
[56:28] is to become rich
[56:34] so it appears as though that's their
[56:37] purpose
[56:38] foreign
[57:38] foreign
[58:38] foreign
[1:00:24] it's more than just dollars foreign
[1:01:01] but it's very difficult right
[1:01:04] on one occasion
[1:01:07] the Lord presented himself to the
[1:01:09] prophet Isaiah
[1:01:13] and he presented to him presented
[1:01:16] himself in chapter six to him we won't
[1:01:18] read it
[1:01:19] and he asks him this question who shall
[1:01:23] go Canada
[1:01:25] who will go which one of us
[1:01:28] believe it's the same question
[1:01:34] we will go to do what needs to get done
[1:01:40] in Phoenix
[1:01:52] in the city of Phoenix
[1:01:56] and God asked who shall go
[1:01:59] shall go make an impact
[1:02:03] and God asks Isaiah
[1:02:08] and I ask you if I asked why did he ask
[1:02:10] him in chapter six
[1:02:13] that he had to let go
[1:02:18] what he saw in a case
[1:02:23] named uh um
[1:02:27] so this chapter begins with the death of
[1:02:30] uziah
[1:02:32] because he had to let go of that
[1:02:34] friendship
[1:02:35] yeah
[1:02:51] things of this world
[1:02:58] the things of this world
[1:03:06] keeping you bound
[1:03:08] s
[1:03:09] you will not be able to serve me because
[1:03:15] that goes to war
[1:03:18] entangles himself with the businesses
[1:03:22] that he may please him with who hath
[1:03:25] chosen him to be a soldier
[1:03:30] now brother Marshall was speaking on
[1:03:32] this uh Richard ruler Dios de niago God
[1:03:36] has something more for him
[1:03:38] God wanted to use them in a greater way
[1:03:47] he knew there was something better
[1:03:50] because we know there's something great
[1:03:53] God can use you more than you can
[1:03:55] imagine
[1:04:14] foreign
[1:04:42] God can use money
[1:04:45] there are people that have nothing
[1:04:48] and they have a love towards money or
[1:04:52] the material things
[1:05:00] God is instructing Timothy through the
[1:05:03] Apostle Paul the Como service
[1:05:07] how to serve like a true servant of God
[1:05:10] he says
[1:05:14] but godliness with the contentment is
[1:05:17] great
[1:05:18] first Timothy 6 6. foreign

[1:06:22] [Music]
[1:07:35] Amanda

[1:08:51] so with their Educational Systems and
[1:08:53] things of this day but it's not so
[1:08:57] there's an investment
[1:09:03] that gives us a greater gain yes
[1:09:09] and that is is to put it all in the
[1:09:11] hands of God
[1:09:13] Jesus Christ from a child
[1:09:17] [Music]
[1:09:18] negotios
[1:09:21] it's my it's it's pertains to me to be
[1:09:24] about my father's business
[1:09:40] we're the ones that don't want to let it
[1:09:43] go
[1:09:44] es
[1:09:46] God wants to free us from what has us
[1:09:48] bounds
[1:09:49] but it's us
[1:09:52] but don't let that go
[1:09:55] in order to obtain the other
[1:09:59] I want you to let go of your possessions
[1:10:02] foreign
[1:10:18] people would rather have possessions
[1:10:21] than experiences
[1:10:50] [Music]

[1:11:23] you could possess
[1:11:27] Ed

[1:13:15] because somebody will always have more

[1:14:05] God will give you the the power to
[1:14:08] impact
[1:14:11] people focus on impressing isn't that
[1:14:15] right
[1:14:16] they don't even impress very much
[1:14:25] Impressions
[1:14:39] that impresses me more
[1:14:43] yourself
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:15:23] I like them
[1:15:36] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:50] that would make a difference in the
[1:15:52] world
[1:15:54] never
[1:16:10] about you
[1:16:12] is
[1:16:18] change the lives
[1:16:43] that
[1:16:45] yes
[1:16:50] you let go of the distractions
[1:16:54] you know technology
[1:16:57] having the the most up-to-date things
[1:17:00] looking at the new things
[1:17:07] just a bunch of distractions
[1:17:10] but if you let it go
[1:17:13] God will give you something he will give
[1:17:16] you a purpose
[1:17:18] occupied for the rest of your life
[1:17:22] the second that you live for that it
[1:17:24] will it will be worth it
[1:17:28] hold of eternal life
[1:17:30] you have to let go of the rest
[1:17:35] say I can't
[1:17:38] two masters
[1:17:49] but you use it for the kingdom of God
[1:17:53] use it for yourself
[1:17:58] to fulfill your own desires
[1:18:01] you're using God's money
[1:18:44] what you have need of
[1:18:48] that's why Paul tells Timothy
[1:18:53] having enough to eat into where that
[1:18:56] should be enough
[1:18:58] in other words he's saying having
[1:19:01] a food and Raymonds
[1:19:07] he'll give you what you need
[1:19:10] to have a clothing is to have a security
[1:19:15] to be safe
[1:19:17] in other words you're not in danger
[1:19:20] and then having what you need
[1:19:23] that's more than enough
[1:19:27] happy fulfilling God's purpose
[1:19:30] let me tell you something
[1:19:34] this is the world has brainwashed us
[1:19:38] it has a serving money
[1:19:45] for everybody
[1:19:51] Gloria
[1:20:39] to the glory of God this is yours he
[1:20:42] says God
[1:20:45] cradled him in his arms
[1:20:48] cradled him in his arms
[1:20:51] I see the glory of Gods
[1:21:05] Matthew 6 19 says
[1:21:11] we have not your Treasures upon Earth
[1:21:15] where Martin Russ does corrupt
[1:21:22] this a he is
[1:21:26] and where thieves break through and
[1:21:28] steals
[1:21:30] lay up your Treasures in Heaven is
[1:21:37] where thieves do not break through and
[1:21:40] Norse
[1:21:41] and here's the verse
[1:21:47] there were your heartbeat also
[1:21:51] God needs a surrendered heart to him
[1:21:54] so in order for him to use it there's no
[1:21:57] other way Brothers
[1:22:03] thank God to give you your vision and
[1:22:05] purpose
[1:22:06] Hallelujah
[1:22:07] dinero gonna forever money as a trial
[1:22:11] that's in your heart
[1:22:13] yes it's a test
[1:22:15] God uses money
[1:22:17] the way we use money
[1:22:20] he sees what's in our hearts
[1:22:23] [Music]
[1:22:24] God doesn't need our money
[1:22:32] he doesn't need our money but
[1:22:34] he needs he needs sons and daughters
[1:22:39] that are
[1:22:41] giversity God does not need our money
[1:22:48] this is
[1:22:59] a servant of God
[1:23:02] the daughter of God
[1:23:08] give themselves
[1:23:16] a person that is greedy
[1:23:19] foreign
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:43] to give
[1:23:45] noise
[1:23:48] it's not in order for God to greaten his
[1:23:51] finances or make them more
[1:23:56] it's the way he uses to to make his
[1:23:59] children greater
[1:24:01] in English I would say it this way
[1:24:05] giving is not God's way of raising funds
[1:24:08] um
[1:24:10] it's God's way of raising children
[1:24:16] that's the way God will form your
[1:24:18] character
[1:24:19] every time I guess
[1:24:27] I'm Letting Go a little more of my my
[1:24:29] selfishness
[1:24:33] letting go of a little more of my greens
[1:24:36] every time I give Carlos
[1:24:42] I'm saying
[1:24:45] it's greater than the money mefendios
[1:25:13] what God has for you
[1:25:18] the Lord wants my heart not my money
[1:25:24] but that's how he has it
[1:25:27] in your heart when when you let go
[1:25:32] the Bible says if you're not even
[1:25:34] faithful with money
[1:25:36] this includes all the materials
[1:25:40] with that
[1:25:44] you won't be faithful in the spirituals
[1:25:48] the Bible says that God will not give
[1:25:51] you what is real
[1:25:57] you can't serve both
[1:26:00] foreign
[1:26:05] and your heart will be there
[1:26:11] we don't do more for God because
[1:26:15] we walk for money
[1:26:17] buy money buy money
[1:26:20] if I don't have money I won't go I mean
[1:26:25] the greedy one isn't the one that just
[1:26:27] has money
[1:26:30] the ones that are greedy the ones
[1:26:42] in other words agreed
[1:26:47] not just the money
[1:26:49] the possessions
[1:27:11] then we won't go
[1:27:36] good job God will provide
[1:27:41] you don't have to worry Church
[1:28:16] here we go
[1:28:17] yes
[1:28:20] and there's others that don't want to
[1:28:22] sacrifice
[1:28:23] there's some that don't do anything
[1:28:24] because they say they don't have
[1:28:26] anything
[1:28:29] that don't do anything
[1:28:31] because they don't want to sacrifice
[1:28:33] what they have
[1:28:36] the more we have sacrificio the greater
[1:28:39] the sacrifice foreign
[1:28:59] the more things are holding us back
[1:29:04] it's hard it's harder to sacrifice
[1:29:10] you think somebody that lives on a Bed
[1:29:12] of Roses
[1:29:17] go sleep on a bed
[1:29:19] a hot bed
[1:29:24] it's hot it'll be hot at night
[1:29:27] they say well I'm okay
[1:29:33] it's kind of hard to serve God
[1:29:36] the reason is because you have a lot
[1:29:40] he didn't have a place to lay his head
[1:29:42] on
[1:29:43] the fox has had more than him
[1:29:47] that's what he said
[1:29:50] they had more than he did
[1:29:52] the more we have
[1:29:54] the less we want to sacrifice
[1:30:04] what happens
[1:30:07] we die with our money
[1:30:10] like the richest
[1:30:12] without doing anything for God
[1:30:16] says
[1:30:19] lean on to thy own understanding this is
[1:30:25] you know we get up here as ministers
[1:30:30] we're always giving out to the people
[1:30:32] everything that's in us
[1:30:35] I preached the subject one time where
[1:30:37] Jesus said
[1:30:47] are they neither toil or spinning yet I
[1:30:50] say unto you that Solomon in all his
[1:30:51] glory was not a raid like one image
[1:30:56] [Music]
[1:31:00] to make itself
[1:31:07] he opens up
[1:31:12] they say
[1:31:14] is
[1:31:17] to smell the perfume from him
[1:31:21] the biggest the honey right out of the
[1:31:23] heart
[1:31:28] gives everything out that he toils to
[1:31:31] take it
[1:31:33] and I call my message
[1:31:41] ministers give themselves
[1:31:45] and it's good then just to sit down
[1:31:53] we like to sit under each others
[1:32:05] grateful to have this opportunity to do
[1:32:07] that
[1:32:10] the musicians can't come forward
[1:32:14] they were sharing with brother Branham
[1:32:19] about the first church
[1:32:25] and how did they they sold everything
[1:32:31] have you read the book of Acts
[1:32:34] have you read the book of Acts
[1:32:38] it says that they sold it all right
[1:32:42] no I'm not asking you to sell everything
[1:32:45] before you get scared
[1:32:54] what a mistake that they made
[1:32:57] why did they sell everything
[1:33:02] persecution came they didn't have houses
[1:33:04] or anything
[1:33:05] they didn't have a place to hide
[1:33:08] but brother says
[1:33:17] when the persecution came
[1:33:21] in order to disperse or spread the
[1:33:24] message
[1:33:26] to places throughout the world
[1:33:29] because they didn't have anything to
[1:33:31] hold them back
[1:33:32] let me tell you
[1:33:37] well they don't have anything to hold
[1:33:39] them back when you've lost it all
[1:33:42] when you have nothing
[1:33:44] to say this is mine
[1:33:47] then God can use you
[1:33:50] then God shows you what you were made
[1:33:52] for
[1:33:54] Paul said I all have it as well
[1:34:08] again over there in eternity
[1:34:13] it has nothing to offer me oh Brothers
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:20] there's nothing wrong with having things
[1:34:23] the problem is we're so greedy
[1:34:27] and the Bible says that the greedy will
[1:34:30] not enter because
[1:34:31] God can't use them
[1:34:36] the little that we have we want to is
[1:34:40] we don't use it for God's Kingdom
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:49] Lord I don't have anything to lose
[1:35:00] all I can take is what I did for God
[1:35:04] I don't have anything to lose
[1:35:07] the money that you have in the bank
[1:35:09] [Music]
[1:35:11] the the economists
[1:35:17] if the economy fails
[1:35:20] only ten percent of what's in the bank
[1:35:23] truly exists
[1:35:25] the rest is all digital
[1:35:33] what we have
[1:35:36] but okay
[1:35:37] but what I have in heaven is
[1:35:41] greater than anything we have on this
[1:35:43] Earth
[1:35:47] how many Souls have you impacted
[1:35:51] how much has your life done for someone
[1:35:53] something somebody else
[1:35:55] how much do you have in glory

[1:36:57] how many want to be used by God
[1:37:02] Brown says about Stephen this is
[1:37:06] that man knew what he was talking about
[1:37:11] the customers
[1:37:17] they knew what he was believing in he
[1:37:19] knew what he was believing in is
[1:37:29] that small little fellow he raised up
[1:37:33] and said
[1:37:34] yesterday I see Jesus standing at the
[1:37:36] right hand of God
[1:37:40] when the Clause was beating his little
[1:37:42] brains
[1:37:48] I don't believe he fought the lick of it
[1:37:51] God had him huddled into his arms
[1:38:26] he impacted that man had upon his life
[1:38:29] Paulo Paul
[1:38:33] he's not Jesus in that man
[1:38:37] [Music]
[1:38:42] you say well I have a lot of things
[1:38:45] but how many Souls do you have
[1:38:49] how much have you done for God
[1:38:52] that's what's gonna be worth anything in
[1:38:55] the end
[1:38:57] please stand
[1:39:05] there are people
[1:39:09] that love the material things without
[1:39:13] having them
[1:39:17] and there are people that have the
[1:39:19] material things without loving them
[1:39:27] the more you use it for God
[1:39:31] the easier will be for God to give to
[1:39:33] you because
[1:39:35] he knows what you're using it foreign
[1:39:45] sorry you know
[1:39:52] just have a Pequeno and I was uh young I
[1:39:55] was a child
[1:39:56] I grew up poor we probably very poor
[1:40:02] Burger King once a month we'd go to
[1:40:04] Burger King
[1:40:05] when the government would help us
[1:40:10] that was a great event for us
[1:40:15] yeah I would always say I'm gonna give
[1:40:18] it all I got
[1:40:21] I want to do something on this Earth

[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:54] I know I could have made a lot of money
[1:40:57] [Music]
[1:40:58] but it got to the point
[1:41:02] where I realized that that won't make a
[1:41:05] person happy
[1:41:08] but like brother Brandon says
[1:41:11] when he saw Souls on the altar
[1:41:14] IO
[1:41:15] [Music]

[1:42:27] this world
[1:42:30] but I want to use what he has given me
[1:42:33] for his honor and His glory
[1:42:37] I was telling the Lord in these days
[1:42:54] [Music]
