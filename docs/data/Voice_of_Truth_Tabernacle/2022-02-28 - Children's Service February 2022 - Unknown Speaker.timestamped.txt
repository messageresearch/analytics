[18:38] have had a dream that deeply troubles me
[18:41] and i must know what it means
[18:43] but they couldn't tell the dream because
[18:45] god had a plan for his children even
[18:47] when they were in slavery the king was
[18:50] furious because nobody could tell him
[18:52] his dream and he ordered that all the
[18:54] wise men of babylon be executed
[18:57] and because of the king's decree men
[18:59] were sent to find and kill daniel and
