[40:10] his word
[40:13] also jesus
[40:16] jesus invited mary magdalene
[40:20] to unite to his ministry team
[40:42] and it came to pass afterward that he
[40:44] went throughout every city and village
[40:46] preaching showing glad tidings of the
[40:48] kingdom of god and the twelve were with
[40:50] him
[40:56] and a certain woman which had been

[42:05] urchoid has spent all her living upon
[42:07] physicians neither could be healed by
[42:09] any
[42:16] behind him and touched the border of his
[42:18] garment and immediately her issue of
[42:19] blood
[42:20] stanched
[42:26] this woman
[42:42] anything she touched
[42:44] was impure
[42:46] for 12 years
[42:49] the man saw her that way
[42:53] but the lord jesus christ
[43:18] yes
[43:37] and behold a woman in the city which was
[43:38] a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at
[43:40] me in the pharisee's house brought an
[43:42] alabaster box of ointment yesterday
[43:58] and stood at his feet behind him weeping
[44:00] and began to wash his feet with tears
[44:01] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[44:03] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[44:05] them with the ointment
[44:39] wanted to stay with him
[44:45] he stayed for two days in samaria
[45:03] magdalena trusted it to mary magdalene
[45:07] and told her to go
[45:10] and tell the disciples
[45:15] amongst the dead

[46:14] and that he had spoken these things to
[46:15] her
[46:22] how does the lord
[46:25] back then
[47:10] [Applause]
[47:21] and transformed
[47:36] and every one

[47:53] about this woman that anointed his head
[47:55] with ointment
[47:58] matthew 26 12.

[48:27] be told for a memorial of her man
[48:32] what you sisters argan whatever you do
[48:36] for the lord
[48:38] it will be taken in account
[48:41] and it will be taken
[48:43] like a great memorial
[49:09] if you help me with this this image
[49:22] um
[50:10] human flesh no important
[50:12] significante no matter how little or
[50:14] insignificant
[50:17] he cared
[50:19] morales
[50:22] alcoholics
[50:23] whatever it was
[50:28] in chicago i think of little rosella
[50:30] griffith in chicago
[50:33] her book is coming out now quentin
[50:36] tambil algran association
[50:42] that came into the meeting so vile till
[50:44] the great alcoholics anonymous had
[50:46] turned her down
[50:52] and about six or eight famous hospitals
[50:54] of chicago had wrote her name off the
[50:57] book
[50:58] never to come there
[51:03] maybe those hospitals removed her name
[51:19] of the world
[51:33] until the only thing she had left was a
[51:35] code that her mother gave her
[51:39] parameters
[51:40] she cut it on the inside to put her
[51:43] bottles down into there
[51:46] such an alcoholic
[51:57] [Music]
[52:02] smart
[52:09] [Music]
[52:14] where we was having a meeting
[52:30] but
[52:43] she's an alcoholic
[53:12] a
[53:24] to save alcoholics
[54:02] but i enjoyed it and i give thanks to
[54:04] god my brother titus shared with me
[54:08] of this
[54:09] fragile vessel
[54:13] it doesn't mean it's a weak vessel
[54:16] but on all the contrary
[54:20] it's made of a special material
[54:36] do a lot
[55:17] i believe he closed with a golden brush
[55:21] although the woman
[55:28] wasn't created
[55:30] in the original creation
[55:42] i believe that was a ceiling with a
[55:44] golden brush
[55:46] sealing
[56:11] god bless you brother
[56:14] [Applause]
[56:20] god bless everyone
[56:23] um if you would just uh stand with me
[56:24] for a little bit
[56:27] yeah now open your bibles
[56:31] to the book of genesis chapter two ayan
[56:33] hennessey's capital of those verse 23.
[56:38] saying greetings to the brothers
[56:41] mr manos
[56:53] genesis 2 verse 23.
[56:56] reads like this this i see
[56:58] and adam said this is now a bone of my
[57:01] bones
[57:02] and flesh of my flesh
[57:04] she shall be called woman because she
[57:06] was taken out of man
[57:09] says
[57:17] therefore shall a man leave his father
[57:19] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[57:21] wife and they shall be one flesh
[57:37] this is actually the first time recorded
[57:39] in the bible
[57:43] the man expresses himself
[57:45] towards somebody
[57:50] so he expresses himself
[57:52] towards
[57:53] his his his wife elsa espresso
[57:58] those were his of uh first words towards
[58:00] somebody similar to to who he was
[58:08] that's that was uh to me that just kind
[58:10] of stood out to me
[58:13] how he just expresses himself
[58:17] and i could just imagine uh you know
[58:19] that moment
[58:31] and he sees uh the most beautiful thing
[58:34] that he has ever seen outside of god
[58:40] and he says you know this is bone of my
[58:43] bone
[58:45] so that means
[58:46] flesh of my flesh
[58:48] in
[59:10] and i just kind of uh just got into a
[59:13] little bit what actually the bone and
[59:15] flesh is
[59:30] you know and then
[59:44] that's exactly what it is
[59:47] that's what i would say more to i would
[59:49] incline more to saying something softer
[59:54] because it's more fragile
[59:56] but you know what we man couldn't be
[59:59] couldn't be man without without either
[1:00:02] perro
[1:00:04] you see man could not be
[1:00:08] he could not be one flesh
[1:00:12] you know had he not had that softer side
[1:00:16] amen so there had to be the the the the
[1:00:20] hard side of man
[1:00:24] i wouldn't say solve the strong
[1:00:26] side the stronger style
[1:00:30] you know
[1:00:31] but you know he couldn't be one flesh
[1:00:33] you know without that softer side
[1:00:38] so in other words
[1:00:40] he was
[1:00:52] and then he just felt lonely for a
[1:00:54] moment
[1:01:22] so he needed
[1:01:36] he could step on
[1:01:39] somebody that would be equal to what he
[1:01:41] wanted
[1:01:45] that's what i believe
[1:01:46] i believe man is not better than women
[1:02:02] [Music]
[1:02:05] that last sub brought us
[1:02:08] so that he could finish you know the
[1:02:10] creation
[1:02:13] amen amen i believe that 100 percent
[1:02:17] you know because god just keeps showing
[1:02:19] his greatness
[1:02:22] he goes from faith to faith
[1:02:25] from glory to glory and glory and when
[1:02:27] he's saying when adam saw this woman
[1:02:30] he had never seen anything
[1:03:12] you know he uh
[1:03:16] he says
[1:03:19] he says this in the restoration of the
[1:03:22] bride tree restoration
[1:03:24] he says but watch
[1:03:26] him say he was god's perfect prophet
[1:03:29] tree speaking of jesus here
[1:03:32] perfecto prophet
[1:03:35] he said the example tree the bridegroom
[1:03:37] tree amen el ar vol novio a man glory
[1:03:40] gloria he says i'm going to say
[1:03:42] something directly
[1:03:44] it says if he is the bridegroom tree
[1:03:48] do you believe it
[1:03:50] this is from the garden of eden
[1:03:53] it says in the bridegroom tree without
[1:03:55] the female don't
[1:04:38] of what the
[1:04:52] what could god do
[1:04:54] how could he express himself
[1:04:58] if if he did not have a bride
[1:05:01] if he didn't have somebody
[1:05:04] that that that was made of the same
[1:05:06] material
[1:05:48] what
[1:06:23] he says we reflect god
[1:06:26] as god is in us
[1:06:44] that's how
[1:06:57] your walks your talks your actions all
[1:07:00] reflect christ
[1:07:06] because you might not think that people
[1:07:07] are watching you
[1:07:11] but they're watching every
[1:07:26] our business
[1:08:25] amen amen
[1:08:29] and when we think about
[1:08:30] this
[1:08:31] this god
[1:08:34] you know we we
[1:08:36] want to express what he wants or what he
[1:08:39] is
[1:08:40] when we think about god
[1:08:43] we want to express what he is
[1:08:47] not what he is
[1:08:50] amen amen that that's what he wants
[1:08:53] that's what he's looking for
[1:08:56] you said he's not looking for a for a
[1:08:58] bribe
[1:09:00] he's not looking for that woman
[1:09:04] oh that that does not trust him
[1:09:08] that does not trust in his power
[1:09:11] that does not trust in
[1:09:13] his words
[1:09:15] but that's fearful
[1:09:17] that's fearful that he's scared of
[1:09:19] taking him at his word
[1:09:22] because then you're showing the people
[1:09:25] because then you're showing the people
[1:09:27] who's telling them
[1:09:30] if you don't act on his words
[1:09:46] you're not trusting
[1:10:24] i don't want people to think that i
[1:10:25] serve a god that's scared
[1:10:56] salvation
[1:11:09] amen amen
[1:11:25] that's why she's so special
[1:11:28] special you know she's so special
[1:11:32] i'm going to be closing here in a bit
[1:11:35] and give myself some time
[1:11:38] but uh
[1:11:41] the woman she just has something very
[1:11:43] special
[1:11:45] especially it's
[1:11:47] pretty insane
[1:11:49] i saw enclave oh what what the woman can
[1:11:52] do okay
[1:11:59] she just moves uh the man in a certain
[1:12:02] way
[1:12:06] you know when there's actual love
[1:12:10] oh there ai you know i'm gonna say this
[1:12:13] my wife's not here so i'm not i'm not
[1:12:15] putting her on the spot
[1:12:18] and
[1:12:20] uh
[1:12:34] i can kind of identify with adam
[1:12:38] you know when he saw her for the first
[1:12:40] time
[1:12:43] and uh just uh just
[1:12:45] it just kind of
[1:12:46] it was just something man i can't really
[1:12:49] explain it yes
[1:12:55] but i believe that this is uh something
[1:13:00] you know that um adam may have felt
[1:13:03] the adam felt okay
[1:13:06] you know when he saw his wife
[1:13:09] when he's when he felt loved for the
[1:13:12] very first time
[1:13:15] towards another being like him
[1:13:23] a man a man you know and and i can see
[1:13:26] this
[1:13:28] oh you know in in in in the fall and
[1:14:25] and you know a lot of times muchas vez
[1:14:28] says you see we we don't fully
[1:14:30] understand many times
[1:14:32] completely oh you know the the the
[1:14:35] fragile uh um side of of of our other
[1:14:38] half eladon
[1:15:08] without her
[1:15:11] you know so that's where the devil
[1:15:13] is
[1:15:14] that's where he'll attack
[1:15:17] but that's where he'll attack the man
[1:15:21] he can't take the man down
[1:16:03] that's right
[1:16:18] we have to
[1:17:13] by anybody else
[1:17:42] that jesus had for his church jesus
[1:17:46] yeah i just want to read one more quote
[1:17:48] from brother branham
[1:17:50] remember remember our thought is she is
[1:17:52] what he is
[1:18:04] he says
[1:18:06] now he is looking for the day
[1:18:09] for the day that the for that bribe to
[1:18:12] be formed
[1:18:13] just exactly like it was like he was
[1:18:17] esperanto
[1:18:22] it's got to be his same flesh
[1:18:37] and them two then become one
[1:19:06] this
[1:19:33] he was
[1:22:09] you know i was just kind of expressing
[1:22:11] with the pastor especially
[1:22:14] um the other day hello
[1:22:16] just kind of wondering
[1:22:19] why jesus you know in in in revelations
[1:22:22] 3 17
[1:22:27] you know he just expresses that he would
[1:22:29] spew you know the the church out of his
[1:22:32] mouth
[1:22:36] you know why why would we be in his
[1:22:38] mouth
[1:22:41] no we're uh
[1:22:43] the reason you know i believe
[1:22:46] it's because we're we're an expression
[1:22:48] of what he is
[1:22:50] an expression
[1:23:15] because they're not expressing what he
[1:23:17] is
[1:23:32] don't give them another they have
[1:23:34] nothing to show for them
[1:23:36] they have no out of it
[1:23:39] because if they did
[1:23:41] they would realize how poor they are
[1:24:12] when it's all you know we think it's all
[1:24:15] over nope
[1:24:18] you know i don't think that uh the true
[1:24:20] church you know croqueta
[1:24:22] verdadera
[1:24:24] the real bride of jesus
[1:24:27] jesus she won't trust in what she is
[1:24:30] yeah no confirm okay yes
[1:24:33] so trust in what he is
[1:24:36] oh she'll trust in what he did
[1:24:39] but she won't trust in her own strengths
[1:24:56] if there's a
[1:24:57] [Music]
