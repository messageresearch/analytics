[24:05] Ty
[24:12] as
[24:17] well unto the Lord thy God Thou shalt
[24:20] not select to pay it for the Lord thy

[24:34] shall keep and perform
[24:46] even a free will offering according as
[24:49] thou has vowed unto the Lord thy God
[24:51] which thou has promised with thy mouth
[24:56] I'm not sure how many of you knew this
[24:59] was written here
[25:00] [Music]
[25:02] when I read this I discovered it wow and

[28:42] to stop going yeah
[28:48] according to it is
[29:21] but he made a disaster
[29:28] La Familia
[29:30] good morning to the family
[29:38] my brothers and I would raise the noise
[29:42] they went on different paths
[29:48] they did things they never thought they
[29:50] do
[29:54] and because
[29:56] they didn't stand
[29:59] sometimes we don't measure the
[30:01] consequences
[30:04] [Music]
[30:59] what's happening
[31:40] and he's just waiting foreign
[32:08] that's what the enemy does
[32:11] That's what Satan does
[32:14] I was next
[32:21] my country a hurricane that
[32:24] people were devastated
[32:29] and after this hurricane that strikes
[32:32] our country
[32:33] I began to feel better
[32:37] I had a fever
[32:42] my body began to change
[32:44] I went to the doctor
[32:53] medication
[32:57] a couple days later
[33:02] and that's how I was for about two
[33:04] months
[33:10] I couldn't walk
[33:12] spiritual
[33:19] is
[33:22] my spiritual blindness and in my heart
[33:27] I couldn't see God
[33:33] although I knew there was a God I never
[33:37] saw him
[33:39] the enemy had me very bound
[33:43] very locked up
[33:51] I feel very weird
[33:56] the doctor already
[34:07] [Music]
[34:12] let me stay in the hospital
[34:15] in my conditions
[34:19] foreign

[36:03] and
[36:09] they begin to explain me there's two
[36:11] valves in your home
[36:14] okay
[36:21] Japanese
[36:23] this bacteria was able to pass a
[36:29] through the the end
[36:33] through the valve and it came into my
[36:37] heart is
[36:44] so the two main veins
[36:48] that's why your heart is not working
[36:52] that's why it is
[36:55] your valves are not functioning
[36:59] and they give me this news
[37:08] so we can understand
[37:12] when we allow problems
[37:15] the advantage over our family
[37:19] may God help us
[37:22] and we can understand
[37:29] so
[38:29] succeeding killing this
[38:31] and then have surgery
[38:35] and they give me that news and they
[38:37] leave the room oh beloved imagine
[38:43] I was young
[38:45] I didn't want to die
[38:48] when they tell me that news
[38:51] God is so good
[38:54] it was so merciful
[38:58] he brought to my memories
[39:25] I fell on the floor
[39:29] foreign
[39:54] [Music]
[40:29] foreign
[41:50] Lord
[41:55] [Music]
[42:07] if you give me a car
[42:11] okay
[42:21] I said it in my heart
[42:24] I promise
[42:27] that I will go to church
[42:34] and I'll go to church again
[42:58] a new job new car
[43:19] and then God came and reminded me
[43:23] in a surgical room dying
[43:29] between life and death
[43:32] is
[43:33] there I remember my promise wow
[43:40] and there was only God and I
[43:43] see you God and I noticed
[43:47] with a news of death
[43:51] a body that's deteriorating
[43:56] and there I fell on the floor
[44:01] and I began to ask God to forgive me
[44:05] impossible I began to ask God for
[44:09] forgiveness
[44:11] because I didn't want to die yesterday
[44:15] I knew there was a hell
[44:18] and my life was in danger
[44:23] of how far the devil took me
[44:28] because I disobeyed God
[44:31] and there I was
[44:46] he will not despise or turn away
[44:51] all of a sudden I hear
[44:54] I knock out the door
[44:58] an older man
[45:01] that I've never seen okay never seen
[45:05] this man
[45:06] foreign
[45:12] he was a chaplain at the hospital he was
[45:14] telling me
[45:16] um
[45:17] he says young man
[45:21] I I'm finished in the hospital
[45:25] and I'm going home
[45:30] but as he was leaving the door
[45:33] God speaks to my heart
[45:36] and he tells me stop
[45:38] [Music]
[45:40] go inside that room that's there is
[45:48] that I have the last word
[45:53] that I have the last word
[45:57] that if he repents from his sin he said
[46:00] William me and turns back to me
[46:04] I will take him away from this
[46:08] I will heal him
[46:12] and I'll make him a preacher of my word
[46:16] wow
[47:05] because I
[47:08] didn't fulfill him
[47:13] something so material
[47:15] or something material a
[47:19] simple car
[47:21] Hallelujah
[47:24] yeah

[47:41] 24 years ago
[47:44] not manifested in a mighty way
[47:48] and he took us out of the hospital
[47:53] and ever since we've been preaching the
[47:55] word of God
[47:59] wonders of God
[48:03] telling the people
[48:05] there's nothing impossible
[48:09] but it's necessary to get here
[48:11] to stop ourselves
[48:16] our differences
[48:19] and serve God
[48:21] forgive each other
[48:24] as God demands in his word
[48:42] thank you
[48:45] [Applause]
[48:50] you could just open your Bibles
[48:54] and just stand for a few moments
[48:57] to the Book of Jeremiah chapter 30.
[49:02] verse 12 is the 13 verse
[49:07] our theme is restoring the bride
[49:11] and for a title
[49:13] John and I mean
[49:16] we titled it all access
[49:21] amen amen
[49:23] and we're just going to leave off where
[49:25] our pastor left off last week or take
[49:28] off where he left off
[49:32] we had Jeremiah 30 verse 12 and 13 reads
[49:36] like this
[49:37] [Music]
[49:41] it says for thus said the Lord thy
[49:44] bruise is incurable and thy wound is
[49:46] Grievous
[49:48] there is none to plead thy cause the
[49:50] thou mayest be bound up
[49:52] thou Hast no healing medicine
[50:05] for I will restore Health unto thee and
[50:08] I will heal that's this is verse 17.
[50:11] yesterday
[50:13] will restore Health unto thee and I will
[50:16] heal thee of thy wounds said the Lord
[50:22] because they call the an outcast saying
[50:25] this is Zion whom no man seeketh after
[50:28] this
[50:39] uh you know uh I'm pretty I'm pretty
[50:42] excited
[50:44] I'm a
[50:47] it's actually the first the first time
[50:50] I've actually brought a fellow alignment
[50:53] to church
[50:57] yeah and you know
[51:01] um I think maybe some of them seen me on
[51:02] online or something
[51:05] but you know the first time it's always
[51:07] special
[51:08] you know I remember uh you know the
[51:11] first time my wife took me to church
[51:13] I remember my mentality was
[51:18] well I was I wanted to go because I
[51:21] wanted to make her happy okay
[51:23] yeah but you know at the end of the day
[51:26] you know I was like you know she needs
[51:28] help
[51:31] but you know I I think I was the one
[51:33] that that needed the help
[51:36] he was he was after me
[51:39] a lot of times we're always you know
[51:40] like hey man they need help
[51:44] we're actually the ones
[52:11] amen amen and you know when we talk
[52:14] about you know a brother Titus left off
[52:17] on the Brokenness
[52:21] you know how uh you know the bride needs
[52:23] to be restored
[52:26] you know brother John's a testimony
[52:29] you know him having to go to the doctor
[52:33] in order for uh for for the help
[52:37] you know that he actually needed
[52:39] you know the circumstances of life
[52:45] I was actually reading something that
[52:56] [Music]
[53:04] [Music]
[53:08] while mentally emotionally morally
[53:10] socially and spiritually well
[53:18] so we can have all those you know we
[53:21] could we could be spiritual sick but we
[53:22] could be fine in that area
[53:26] and then it says this is
[53:33] and and sickness in any other
[53:35] combination
[53:45] [Music]
[54:03] so you know when you're emotionally and
[54:06] spiritually not well
[54:09] that actually carries over into your
[54:12] physical body
[54:15] and then you're not understanding what's
[54:18] happening
[54:21] how you could be physically well
[54:25] but you know emotionally
[54:28] or your state of mind
[54:30] it's not in the right place
[54:37] oh you know you you're trying to find
[54:39] some help
[54:40] you know sometimes people go to the
[54:43] psychologists
[54:45] sometimes they go to the co-workers
[54:49] you know so dear friends
[54:51] you know or just somebody out there
[54:55] you know they're trying to find help
[54:58] you know a lot of times they can't find
[55:00] it
[55:01] you know but I know uh you know I think
[55:03] we come to a place
[55:05] you know what we can find where we know
[55:07] where the hell is
[55:09] no I think that when we come up here
[55:13] you know we're here to help
[55:18] oh we should all be here
[55:21] one another
[55:24] you know in one way or another
[55:27] we were called here
[55:29] you know to strengthen one another
[55:31] foreign
[55:46] amen amen you know and when we sit there
[55:48] and we we talk about healing
[55:52] you know I think you can't speak of
[55:54] healing without speaking about Jesus
[55:59] amen amen you know in Revelation chapter
[56:02] three an apocalypse is stress now verse
[56:05] 20. it reads like this very familiar
[56:09] scripture
[56:11] it says behold I stand at the door and
[56:13] knock
[56:15] If any man hear my voice
[56:26] you know I believe Jesus is knocking
[56:29] Jesus
[56:40] and uh you know one of the things that
[56:43] the restoration is our business
[56:47] that's what we do oh we restore
[56:50] restaurant you know and one of the
[56:52] things that we have to do
[56:54] a lot of times you know we would at
[56:57] least I don't like to do it
[56:59] is that you know we have to go knocking
[57:02] on people's doors
[57:05] I like to go knock it on doors
[57:09] because I don't have a very friendly
[57:11] face
[57:14] if I was the person inside
[57:17] I wouldn't open the door I'd be like man
[57:21] I you better call the cops
[57:24] you know because I don't have a very
[57:26] friendly face
[57:27] and you know I think uh you know when
[57:30] when somebody comes knocking
[57:32] oh you know we're living in the time
[57:35] where you know you can see who's at the
[57:37] door without opening the door
[57:40] you know we have all this Electronics
[57:42] all these cameras
[57:46] I mean I could be uh I could be 300
[57:48] miles away
[57:50] I could see the Amazon package
[57:53] Amazon you know right there at the door
[57:56] you probably change your whole mood
[58:03] don't tell Alex to go get it
[58:05] he will leave it out there
[58:08] but anyway
[58:10] the thing about it is that you know we
[58:14] sit there and we hear the door knocking
[58:17] you know I go knock on somebody's door
[58:21] and uh you know they don't answer in
[58:24] novren and uh you know I I always ask
[58:27] myself
[58:29] I wonder if somebody's in there
[58:32] no because if they're not if they if
[58:35] they are there
[58:36] and we and we kill the power
[58:40] I guarantee you they'll come out
[58:43] I guarantee you they'll come out
[58:46] we went to a place one time
[58:49] we were in Denver and Denver and we had
[58:51] to we had uh we had to open some fuses
[59:18] we got to go ahead
[59:22] to go open the fuses
[59:24] we started we all started laughing
[59:28] but watch everybody's gonna come out
[59:35] like that was like like 100 people that
[59:37] came out
[59:39] well at first the door would not be open
[59:42] you know somebody was knocking against
[59:45] you know and they wouldn't open the door
[59:48] and as soon as the power is gone
[59:51] electricity you know then everybody
[59:54] comes out
[1:00:51] I want
[1:00:53] complete heal
[1:01:53] when you
[1:02:42] amen amen
[1:02:46] foreign
[1:03:25] and uh you know one of the other things
[1:03:27] that happens when they don't answer is
[1:03:32] that uh you know the the power is gone
[1:03:35] there's no lights
[1:03:40] it's funny how people come up yes
[1:03:47] and all of a sudden you know they can't
[1:03:49] breathe
[1:03:51] I can't breathe
[1:03:53] they've been on oxygen
[1:03:56] I went to a place one time
[1:03:58] and there was like 10 people like maybe
[1:04:01] like nine out of the ten they they were
[1:04:03] they needed oxygen to breathe yeah
[1:04:06] I'm wondering if they were that they
[1:04:09] weren't being they weren't able to
[1:04:10] breathe
[1:04:11] because you know maybe there are social
[1:04:14] media life was uh was it was an intended
[1:04:16] for the moment
[1:04:19] so your life
[1:04:24] you know I got no Facebook foreign
[1:05:37] what we do is we have to start a
[1:05:40] call in and locate
[1:05:42] just just say like like I said it is
[1:05:49] you know different parts
[1:05:52] we have to locate gas we have to locate
[1:05:56] water
[1:05:57] we have to locate Communications
[1:06:00] we gotta locate all kinds of different
[1:06:03] things
[1:06:03] [Music]
[1:06:05] that actually go to your home you can
[1:06:08] see
[1:06:10] so that we don't hit it
[1:06:14] so you know we we we have to call that

[1:15:47] savior if he's your healer if he's your
[1:15:51] God he shouldn't have to ask

[1:16:05] he's God with or without you
[1:16:08] if you reject the healing
[1:16:11] he's gonna find somebody else that will
