[20:58] and the lord said to her two nations are
[21:00] in your womb and two peoples from within
[21:02] you shall be divided the one shall be
[21:04] stronger than the other the older shall
[21:05] serve the younger when her days to give
[21:07] birth were completed behold there were
[21:09] two there were twins in her womb
[21:12] you may be seated
[21:25] we always have those two natures in us
[21:41] he had supernatural signs
[21:47] supernatural signs
[21:50] but he was also born with the two
[21:52] natures
[21:54] he had to struggle he had to fight
[22:21] down but not out man
[22:38] and then chapter 64.
[22:42] it's called
[22:43] the
[22:44] the anointing for life or of life
[22:48] from 1953
[22:52] alert
[22:57] but first i would like to read this
[22:58] quote
[23:01] priest in 1960.
[23:22] and how and how it could come from that
[23:24] perfect pure elected holy consecrated
[23:26] father or mother so to base that god
[23:29] calls by election it must be no matter
[23:30] how good your father or mother was
[23:34] important
[23:47] no matter how good your father and
[23:48] mother was how nice they was how much
[23:50] christians your father and mother was it
[23:52] still lies to you as an individual
[23:54] you're standing before god
[23:58] and this i believe it it correlates well
[24:00] with the youth por cabezes
[24:08] because sometimes we think just because
[24:09] we're born in the gospel or because our
[24:10] father or mother
[24:12] we don't have to fight
[24:15] we don't have anything to overcome no
[24:28] but we should take into account that we
[24:29] have both natures
[24:44] william branham had a few nervous
[24:45] conditions he had to go through
[24:49] this
[24:51] table
[24:55] responsibilities
[24:58] wanted to live his life his life without
[25:00] responsibilities or restrictions
[25:06] and then unfortunately this attitude was
[25:08] inducing him to a wrong path
[25:14] and bill look for the right moment to
[25:16] talk about this with his son
[25:20] one one night bill was praying
[25:23] and he saw a vision of his son
[25:26] and he was in a party where they were
[25:28] drinking
[25:35] jumping jumping out of a window and
[25:36] falling until he hit his head fuera
[25:38] control out of control
[25:40] empanada
[25:54] the vision was was finished without a
[25:56] final conclusion
[26:01] and uh bill was was uh put in suspense
[26:05] he was sweating
[26:07] and he prayed
[26:21] that billy didn't have a uh
[26:24] an excuse
[26:26] his father was a man of god
[26:29] filled with the holy spirit
[26:32] billy paul was given the privilege
[26:35] to see the angel of god
[27:18] if
[27:42] he snuck into the house and he was drunk
[27:44] or he smelled like alcohol
[27:55] and bill allowed his son to sleep in as
[27:57] long as he wanted to and when you when
[27:59] he woke up billy paul had planned to go
[28:01] and see a friend
[28:03] established automobile and bill was
[28:05] washing his car
[28:08] and here we can see
[28:11] that that one was also
[28:14] young and one always tries to keep
[28:17] things from their parents
[28:20] and one thing i've always told my
[28:21] children
[28:24] sometimes you think that you deceive us
[28:26] or that you
[28:27] know
[28:28] maybe we may not ever find out
[28:31] what i always tell them
[28:36] many times you think one is dumb
[28:42] but only dumb ones are them
[28:45] diablo
[28:46] because the devil is making you dumb
[28:51] why because the only ones that are
[28:53] persecuted for that are going to be you
[28:56] know the
[29:38] you're starting on the wrong
[30:09] and i can no longer have you there at
[30:11] the reunions
[30:14] because that harms my ministry very much
[30:16] no solo eso and not only that
[30:20] puedesi
[30:33] or leave the house and go to the world
[30:35] decision
[30:37] hard decisions
[30:39] because when the devil deceives you
[30:42] you go for the easy thing
[30:44] which is the world apart
[30:48] and
[31:17] with the firmness of what it was going
[31:18] to tell us
[31:20] but first putting forth love
[31:22] sometimes uh we as parents
[31:26] we catch something in our children
[31:29] and we don't wait for the moment to talk
[31:31] to them
[31:35] sometimes we don't we don't have the
[31:36] discernment of when to stop hitting them
[31:40] sometimes we hit them and so that
[31:42] doesn't work
[31:43] we scream at them
[31:58] and we're seeing the two natures the
[32:00] prophet the prophet
[32:03] with the nature of god
[32:05] standing by the word
[32:06] paul and billy paul
[32:09] on the other side of the scale
[32:12] going to the world
[32:22] and he says that he's the son of a
[32:24] prophet
[32:25] or he's the son of the pastor
[32:41] moment
[32:42] one moment in our lives
[32:44] the devil is going to ask
[32:47] and the devil is going to ask us and
[32:48] we're going to make a mistake
[32:51] but we have to fight
[32:54] a true nature
[32:57] the nature of god
[32:59] because of which you're here
[33:02] because of what you were called
[33:04] you weren't called here
[33:08] to lose yourself
[33:22] from a young age
[33:25] sometimes we want the sunday school
[33:26] teachers
[33:28] in two hours on a sunday
[33:31] to do the work that we should be doing
[33:32] the entire week
[34:16] sometimes we don't we don't uh see the
[34:17] consequences
[34:59] when billy decided to go from his home
[35:03] the story says you can read it
[35:06] that he went to go fishing
[35:08] and he found the lake
[35:13] and he went to the hospital because his
[35:14] throat hurts
[35:28] found him in the hospital
[35:30] he was already he was purple
[35:32] and almost without life
[35:36] and he prayed for him
[35:39] and he was healed
[35:42] pero
[35:54] unfortunately this encounter with death
[36:07] to the crooked way to the evil way
[36:27] he was going to need a stronger lesson
[36:30] than that to straighten his path out
[36:34] and sometimes we don't understand the
[36:35] first time
[36:50] [Music]
[37:06] 34 verse one is
[37:09] estaba
[37:11] now the daughter of leah of leah whom uh
[37:14] nadina the daughter of leah whom she had
[37:15] born to jacob
[37:19] went out to see the woman of the land
[37:34] with her and humiliated her practically
[37:37] he practically raped her
[37:41] what does it refer to when it says go to
[37:43] see the woman of the land
[37:48] she went to go
[38:02] once again fell into the hospital
[38:08] from being drunk so much
[38:12] he had ulcers in his stomach
[38:16] and the prophet had gone on
[39:17] what do you see there esta la cruz he
[39:19] said there's a cross they say
[39:21] and in the midst of in the middle of
[39:23] that cross
[39:24] there are two ways
[39:26] they say uh
[39:53] and at the end when he was healed the
[39:55] second time he said libro the book says
[39:59] that billy paul returned there el centro
[40:01] de la cruz to the middle of the cross
[40:04] this time he decided by jesus christ
[40:06] yesterday
[40:07] and this and tonight
[40:52] with all my heart if you're fine and you
[40:53] pray
[40:55] god will be there
[40:57] el diablo the devil will also be there
[41:01] you're going to get to the side
[41:03] and if you decide
[41:04] wrongly regression
[41:06] it's time for you to go back to the
[41:07] cross
[41:09] thank you brothers god bless you

[43:35] i was asking the lord
[43:40] because the theme is we're still talking
[43:41] about jacob
[43:44] but god gave me this it says he and it
[43:47] says like this
[43:49] is
[43:54] but a young girl that suffered from the
[43:55] age of 12 with a blood illness
[44:04] and had
[44:05] suffered from many medics and had wasted
[44:07] all that she had earned
[44:13] and nothing had had made her profit and
[44:15] it went worse for her
[44:17] cuando hablar de jesus when she heard
[44:20] talking about jesus
[44:22] jesus when she heard about jesus
[44:28] she be she came behind the multitude and
[44:31] touched his garment porque de sia
[44:33] because it would say sito
[44:38] if i'd only touch his garment i shall be
[44:41] healed
[44:45] and instantly the the her sickness was
[44:47] healed
[44:52] and she felt in her body that from that
[44:55] touch she was healed
[44:58] especially
[45:05] and knowing the jesus himself the power
[45:07] that came out of him
[45:10] turning to the multitudes
[45:15] who has touched my garments
[45:23] and his disciples say unto him thou
[45:25] seest the multitude through
[45:27] throgging thee and says thou who touched
[45:29] me
[45:30] pero el

[45:36] that her who had done this thing
[45:39] entonces
[45:52] but the woman fearing and trembling
[45:53] knowing what was done in her came and
[45:55] fell down before him and told him all

[1:02:31] down but not out brother
[1:02:45] that there are two nations in her womb
[1:02:48] pueblos
[1:02:50] the bible says that there are twins
[1:02:52] born
[1:02:55] esau came out first
[1:03:20] why would jacob want to grab his heels
[1:03:26] anybody ask yourself that again
[1:03:43] from the heels
[1:03:47] because jacob
[1:03:50] wanted
[1:03:51] to be
[1:03:53] so born first sido primero
[1:03:58] that was mind-blowing for me
[1:04:04] because jacob unconsciously
[1:04:10] thank you
[1:04:10] wanted
[1:06:01] and jacob a plain man
[1:06:04] dwelling in tents
[1:06:07] now genesis 25 28

[1:06:48] that's what happened here
[1:06:52] and this made them yes
[1:06:54] a dysfunctional family una familia
[1:06:58] this dysfunctional because isaac
[1:07:02] loved esau
