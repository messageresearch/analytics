[29:08] something they said when we come to
[29:10] second service on
[29:13] Sunday they said there's not room for
[29:16] the
[29:17] people they said some of us has to wait

[29:33] faith where's the faith this
[29:36] morning can you call God on the
[29:39] scene there's nothing
[29:41] impossible if you need a
[29:43] church you got to speak the word of
[29:46] God because there's no more
[29:50] people that can fit in this
[29:53] place now the problem that I
[29:56] see we can't can't find any more
[30:02] souls right brother we going to put
[30:06] him so why not call him on the
[30:09] scene why not cry to him this

[33:00] won start with me your
[33:06] [Music]
[33:20] in leader of the audio department so
[33:24] that's our live stream and our lyrics
[33:26] and that are on the screen I have been
[33:29] serving for five years now and I just
[33:34] wanted to share a Thanksgiving and small
[33:36] testimony about our new church uh when I
[33:39] started we only had a small room
[33:42] probably the size of like a walk-in
[33:45] closet um we later then the church and
[33:48] the brothers built a bigger room with
[33:51] some more space for us and it had a
[33:52] window this time that we could see um
[33:56] inside the Sanctuary after that I had
[33:59] this um desire this wish in my heart
[34:03] that we could have a space that was more
[34:06] inside the sanctuary or had a bigger
[34:09] window where we could feel more in the
[34:13] service and be able to to worship with
[34:17] the rest of our church together um as if
[34:20] we were in service and so when we were
[34:23] trying to purchase our current church I
[34:25] actually wasn't able tour the building
[34:27] and just was able to see their pictures
[34:30] but I could see that there was the the
[34:32] balcony there and that was really
[34:34] exciting for me imagining that we could
[34:37] be up there and feel really in service
[34:40] as it wasn't just the window anymore our
[34:43] first service that we had was um I
[34:46] remember this was a Friday service and
[34:49] to me just getting there it was a first
[34:52] ever service and that was just um I just
[34:55] felt super blessed and honestly it was
[34:58] emotional for me it was like a huge
[35:01] milestone a huge deal and I just felt so
[35:04] blessed to be able to call that Church
[35:06] hours and I just wanted to say a big
[35:09] thank you for allowing us to purchase
[35:12] this church and make it our own and make
[35:14] it our new home um and I am I feel so
[35:19] blessed and so grateful every time that
[35:22] um I'm up there serving and it has just
[35:25] been amazing just wanted to say thank
[35:39] you he closed his doors and opens doors
[35:43] where His blessings overflow he says be
[35:47] still and know that I am God and all
[35:50] that he asks is our trust I remember
[35:54] days throughout the years C because we
[35:57] didn't have enough space in our Sunday
[35:59] school department for our children to be
[36:02] taught properly in a classroom I used to
[36:05] pray to God if his will was not for us
[36:09] to build a church to at least give us a
[36:11] bigger
[36:13] building there were times that there
[36:15] were so many kids in one small classroom
[36:19] that it was hard for teachers and kids
[36:21] to move around I used to constant
[36:24] teacher Junior Youth and didn't a
[36:26] classroom at all they were thought in
[36:29] the kitchen in our pastor's office and
[36:32] if the weather was nice we used to go
[36:35] outside there were times where we had to
[36:38] wait for the songs to be over because we
[36:41] were in the kitchen and the sanctuary
[36:44] was in the Next Room and the sound was
[36:46] so loud for them to hear the
[36:49] lesson we had great times and great
[36:51] memories in our old church and even
[36:54] though with our lack of space we never
[36:56] never stop believing that God will open
[36:58] a way for us to walk through and he one
[37:02] day will give us the space that we
[37:04] needed one day
[37:07] unexpectedly I remember the day that
[37:09] reito called me to let me know that a
[37:13] church was for sale the excitement in
[37:16] his voice made my heartbeat so fast of
[37:19] happiness that day I came to my closet
[37:23] and made a sincere prayer telling God
[37:26] that having a bigger church was not a
[37:29] want but a
[37:32] need that this opportunity was a prayer
[37:35] that we were praying for years and I
[37:38] started giving thanks for what was to
[37:40] come little did we know that within two
[37:44] months God was going to work the
[37:46] impossible into possible I remember when
[37:51] Bill shows the building but hard wanted
[37:54] to come out seeing how big the
[37:56] classrooms were my eyes got watery
[37:59] because I could see our kids being
[38:01] thought in those classrooms freely and
[38:05] having the space that they
[38:07] needed God fulfill his promises all we
[38:11] have to do is wait and believe he works
[38:15] in ways we cannot understand I thank God
[38:20] that he still got and he still answers
[38:23] prayers he's the same yesterday today
[38:26] and
[38:49] forever God bless
[38:52] you once again we give you a cordial
[38:55] welcome
[38:57] we're g to uh make the presentation for
[38:59] the drama the
[39:03] play but before that we want to honor
[39:06] and glorify our Lord Jesus
[39:08] Christ and if you would please stand we
[39:11] are going to be reading a
[39:14] scripture it's in the gospel of Mark
[39:16] chap 10 verse
[39:20] 27 Mark 10 verse 27
[39:25] says
[39:34] and Jesus looking upon them said with
[39:36] men it is impossible but not with God
[39:39] for With God all things are
[39:41] possible you may be
[39:44] seated throughout the history of the
[39:47] Bible and
[39:51] Humanity there have been men that have
[39:53] believed in the
[39:55] impossible
[40:01] and they have been common people like
[40:03] each and every one of
[40:05] us that have believed in the
[40:08] impossible we have the example of
[40:11] Moses the example of
[40:13] Noah the example of
[40:15] Abraham as well as
[40:20] Ruth but now we want to present to you a
[40:22] very special
[40:25] person
[40:27] and
[40:29] and about one year
[40:31] ago our
[40:34] church couldn't even
[40:36] imagine that we would have this
[40:40] building but because somebody
[40:43] believed because somebody believed God's
[40:47] word we have what we have we thank
[40:54] god brother it says in the message then
[40:57] Jesus came and
[41:04] called but impossible things are made
[41:06] real when God is took at his
[41:14] word the impossi is made realities when
[41:16] God is taken at his
[41:18] word the theme for the the
[41:22] play is believing The
[41:25] Impossible
[41:27] we know who our Lord Jesus Christ
[41:32] is but we also want to mention Virgin
[41:36] Mary as
[41:37] well because that person
[41:42] believed in the
[41:45] impossible and and and changed the
[41:50] humanity so I'm going to ask that the
[41:52] lights be shut
[41:54] off we will start the the play God bless
[42:25] you
[42:41] almighty
[42:42] God I want to
[42:45] understand you've shown me these things
[42:47] yet to
[42:48] happen and of a special
[42:51] person the
[42:53] Messiah for you have told unto me
[42:56] a virgin shall conceive and bear forth a
[43:00] son and the government shall be upon his
[43:03] shoulders and his name shall be Emanuel
[43:07] and Lord I believe the same Emanuel
[43:10] shall be this Messiah one day
[43:13] send Lord you have showed unto me he
[43:17] will were born in Bethlehem but Lord why
[43:20] will he be born in Bethlehem shouldn't
[43:23] he be born in a mighty City
[43:27] but I do suppose our Mighty King David
[43:30] came from little old Bethlehem and you
[43:32] showed me that he shall be from David's
[43:35] family
[43:36] line and Lord you call this Messiah with
[43:40] great titles such as everlasting God
[43:43] Everlasting father Prince of Peace and
[43:47] mighty God
[43:49] lord if I didn't know any better it'd be
[43:53] Blasphemous to call anyone but you with
[43:54] these names but you calling him in such
[43:57] manner only shows me more he comes
[44:00] straight from
[44:01] you but father in these
[44:04] Visions he looks to be like a servant
[44:07] than a
[44:08] king I see him opening the eyes of the
[44:11] blind Healing The Sick and Performing
[44:14] other great Miracles among the people so
[44:18] Lord if he's such a compassionate King
[44:21] who looks after his
[44:23] people why shall he be rejected
[44:26] I see these sad visions of him being
[44:30] betrayed
[44:32] rejected
[44:33] beaten and even
[44:36] killed
[44:37] Lord why will his own people reject him
[44:41] won't they see he has been the one
[44:44] they've been waiting for for so
[44:47] long oh but Lord you've shown me that
[44:50] this Messiah will be the perfect
[44:54] sacrifice to cleanse us of our sins and
[44:57] forgive us of our
[45:00] wrongdoings oh but Lord I'm exceedingly
[45:03] glad my visions do not end there for on
[45:05] the third day of his death he shall
[45:07] resurrect and the good news of his
[45:09] salvation shall come to every corner of
[45:12] the
[45:14] earth oh Father your ways and
[45:17] understandment are high above
[45:19] mine Lord even if in my mind it may seem
[45:23] impossible at times over the years years
[45:26] of being your Prophet you have shown me
[45:29] that you can do the
[45:31] impossible Lord I will continue to tell
[45:34] your people of what is Yet to Come and
[45:37] we shall wait for our
[45:39] Salvation even if it may take many many
[45:44] [Music]

[47:21] down
[47:24] yes Joseph I was thinking earlier on on
[47:28] my way to the well about the sermon that
[47:30] we heard the other day do you remember
[47:31] that sermon yes I do remember where that
[47:34] that Rabbi where he took his scriptures
[47:36] from over in Genesis and exodus where he
[47:38] said that that Mo God met Moses as the
[47:41] pillar of fire and you know God he took
[47:45] such care of his people Israel that he
[47:48] did he always took them through every
[47:49] trials and every problem that they had
[47:52] doesn't that make you so happy Joseph to
[47:54] know that God is over were our great
[47:56] people it makes me so happy Mary it
[47:59] Thrills my heart so much how he went
[48:02] down there in Egypt this great prophet
[48:05] and showed great signs and wonders and
[48:07] Jehovah just being a provider just just
[48:11] brought the Israelites out to the Red
[48:12] Sea and opened it up and when the
[48:15] Israelites when they were hungry God
[48:18] blowed in coils Mary just for being a
[48:21] provider our Jehovah is a provider Mary
[48:25] and when the is isites when they were
[48:26] thirsty they spoke to a rock and from
[48:30] that rock they got water and when the
[48:32] Israelites when they were in sin when
[48:34] they were bitten by serpents God had
[48:37] Moses make a brass serpent to put it on
[48:39] a pool
[48:40] Mary that that's true but what was your
[48:43] interpretation of that Joseph well Mary
[48:46] my dear I believe it meant that there
[48:47] would be a sin a sin offering one day
[48:50] that the brass serpent the brass meant
[48:53] that the serpent himself was s already
[48:56] judged and the brass serpent was divine
[48:59] judgment and divine judgment would be
[49:02] upon one some day and would be an
[49:05] atonement for healing and my dear Mary
[49:08] that brass serpent meant that I
[49:11] believe but did you notice that he
[49:14] ruined his sermon after speaking of how
[49:16] great Jehovah is and all the Miracles
[49:19] that he does he says that God doesn't
[49:23] doesn't make Miracles anymore that the
[49:25] healing for the sick it just doesn't
[49:28] happen anymore but you know Joseph I
[49:31] could hardly agree with that Rabbi on
[49:32] that I know if he ever was Almighty he
[49:36] is still Almighty if he ever was Jehovah
[49:39] he is still
[49:41] Jehovah and you know why Joseph because
[49:44] he is
[49:48] Je Lord God
[49:52] Almighty he is Je
[49:57] oh god of
[49:59] [Music]
[50:01] creation the of
[50:05] GAD the Rock of
[50:09] Ages he
[50:12] is the god that he
[50:16] the and you know what Joseph I can prove
[50:19] it it says right there in Isaiah let me
[50:21] let me look at the
[50:22] scriptures here Joseph why don't you
[50:24] read the scriptures for today how about
[50:26] you go in and get it dear
[50:39] okay
[50:41] says unto us a child is born unto us a
[50:45] son is given and the government shall be
[50:47] upon his shoulders and his name Shall be
[50:50] Called wonderful counselor Mighty God
[50:54] the Prince of Peace
[50:57] Joseph you're well learned of the
[50:58] scriptures yes what was the prophet
[51:00] speaking of when he said unto us son is
[51:04] born well Mary I believe he was meaning
[51:07] the Messiah the coming Messiah that the
[51:10] prophet Moses spoke of but how will this
[51:13] son be my dear Mary he will be made God
[51:17] he will be God manifested In the Flesh
[51:20] he will be made manifest in the Sun that
[51:23] he will create but what Rel will he have
[51:26] to God my dear Mary remember what Isaiah
[51:29] 7:14 says for that a virgin shall
[51:33] conceive and shall bear a son and he
[51:36] shall be named Emmanuel meaning God With
[51:41] Us that's beautiful it is beautiful Mary

[1:04:09] this is all mysterious to the both of us
[1:04:12] yes but both of us being Believers we
[1:04:15] know that Jehovah has something in store
[1:04:17] for the both of us because he chose us

[1:05:12] we have two baby sheep in our family new

[1:21:34] in Jerusalem no it's not a bunch of
[1:21:37] nonsense why who are you why have you
[1:21:41] come here we came here because the angel
[1:21:44] he spoke to
[1:21:46] me he told me he told me of a king of a
[1:21:51] new king but haven't you heard that I am
[1:21:55] the king here the king of the Jews here
[1:21:58] in Jerusalem no and you're standing in
[1:22:01] front of him no no the angel he told me
[1:22:04] in the dream it was it was a baby boy it
[1:22:07] it can't be you silence
[1:22:11] silence be careful about the next thing
[1:22:14] you say to
[1:22:16] me I'll be

[1:22:43] ago and we've been following it ever
[1:22:46] since to this town of
[1:22:50] Bethlehem so you traveled far from the
[1:22:53] East and then you try and came all this
[1:22:56] way to follow a star to show you this
[1:23:00] new
[1:23:01] king yes that's correct and you say
[1:23:04] there is a child a messiah you say yes
[1:23:08] the new
[1:23:09] king that sounds

[1:24:10] of Israel whose goings forth have been
[1:24:13] from old from
