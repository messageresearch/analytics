his trust also our brothers inan we greet them maybe they're not watching the service now but when the time is right may they receive greetings on our behalf may God be with our brother Titus and the brothers that accompany him and might return them safe at their due time and it's also a pleasure to see everyone here and continue fighting the good battle uh you can follow me to Psalm 73 Psalm 73 we'll read from verse 25 and 26 verse 25 to verse 28 Psalm 73 from verse 25 to 28 whom have I in heaven but thee and there is none upon Earth that I desire beside thee My Flesh and my heart faileth but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever for they that are AAR from thee Shall Perish thou Hast destroyed all them that go a whing from thee verse 28 says but it is good for me to draw near to God I have put my trust the Lord God that I may declare all thy works let us pray bless father we are here in this morning ready to draw nigh unto you Lord and see you closer to our lives be able to feel you touch you and hear you allow it to be bless your congregation here bless everyone seen us throughout the world help us in this morning may you be with us and may you move freely we thank you for all things in your holy precious name our Lord Jesus Christ amen may be seated brother we we are in the subject getting deeper with godber Titus began this subject with another subject that is drawing to God this morning brother guo and myself we titled our message draw closer draw closer and I'd like to read this as close but so far from Jesus and I want to take some words our brother Titus mentioned when he began this subject and these were a few of the words he said said brother what is between you and God an idol another God your job money lies sin what stands between you and God what's causing you to not feel him close today would be a good day to be in accounts with him and say God I feel you far sometimes I say my God we're so far from you maybe so far further than what we think we are further than what we think there in that Pew in this church you can feel very close to God or better said and brother Titus says the Devil Makes Us think that we are close to God but we are so far we think we're following him but we're so far from him and that's how it happens think we're close to God but in reality we're far from him everyone at some point in their lives we have fell far from God whether it be from a situation or problems distractions lack of time or simply just because we decide to act in our own lives and leave God out of our life that's what happens and The Devil Makes Us believe that we are close to God but in reality we're far from God and I want to take this character Judas Judas the scripture says in Luke 22 verse three then entered Sayan into Judah surname is carot being of number of the 12 now you know Judas is the one that delivers the Lord Jesus is the one that sells him out and Matthew 26 also reads verse 47 48 and 49 say and while yet he spake Lo Judas one of the 12 and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and Elders of the people now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever I shall kiss that's same as he hold him fast and for forth with he came to Jesus and said hail master and kissed him now look Judas a character that was so close but so far from Jesus was a man a man elected by Jesus to be part of his disciples he was used by God to glorify his name Judas walked with God With Jesus three years heard the sermons of Jesus heard the teachings of Jesus these teachings against lust against the hardened Hearts against luxury even so Judas betrayed Jesus selling him for a pile of coins Judas saw Jesus's wonders including when Jesus resurrected Lazarus Judas was also serving those baskets when they produced food for more than 500 people he was serving there he was giving and putting his time and even a day before Jesus was betrayed the other 11 disciples could never imagine that it would be Judas that would betray him what was most sure was that Judas couldn't show or you couldn't tell you couldn't tell that role of a someone that would betray him he could hide that that role very well because imagine if the other 11 disciples could notice that Judas his intentions were to sell the master I imagine Peter would have reacted and would have beat him Peter had a high temper but Judas would hide this role very well now look Judas did not betray Jesus the day he kissed him one day one day after the Last Supper judas's fall judas's mistakes was not from one day to the next or it was not all of a sudden some time ago this man had been tempted by the devil and falling and what's worse is that he did nothing to stop what was happening inside him and that's how we are sometimes we know our own condition we know something's wrong with us but many times we don't do anything about it to stop that and we let it continue and we let it grow as our brother Titus said when we're in problems that's when we draw to God but while everything's okay we don't even remember about God sin comes to us draws us far from God sin drains the little of God that is in US s gets us caught up until we are slaves from ourselves because in Judas there was a process it was not all of a sudden it was not from night to morning it was a process he was in charge of money he was in charge of finances and sometimes he would take something from there he would steal so it was a process it was not all of a sudden but all of a sudden his heart would Harden unfaithfulness came out he began to separate and isolate himself he separated himself from life he separated himself from the truth Judas wasn't any type of person this man was a disciple elected by Jesus Christ he was part of the 12 apostles but he wanted to lie to the truth and who is the truth the truth is the Lord Jesus Christ Judas tried to hide from the one that sees everything Judas walked with but his heart was far from him how many believe it so close but so far from Jesus when he betrays him with a kiss that was the sign then he repents but I don't think he repented from his heart to him more than anything it pricked his conscience to deliver innocent blood and this is where he I believe he did not repent from his heart because when he repents for delivering innocent blood how we say instead of putting your chest to the bull and facing reality to go and seek the Lord to go and seek the face of the Lord to go and be humble to go and ask for forgiveness he simply goes to these Pharisees returns their money he leaves and seeks the easiest way goes and commits suicide and that's how we are sometimes many times we fall maybe we fail instead of drawing closer to God it's not just about coming close but to get in be humble seek Jesus's face and ask him for forgiv many times we prer to choke ourselves spiritually yet here's another character Peter another man that also betrayed the Lord Jesus Christ Judas sold him and the Lord Judas sold him and Peter denied him but here's the difference between both both Apostles Walk With Jesus both Apostles sat at Jesus's both Apostles saw his wonders both Apostles saw the Miracles Jesus did both apostles ate with Jesus most Apostles laugh with Jesus but when the time came the most crucial moment was com that was a moment for the Lord Jesus Christ to die and be delivered after that last supper the Lord Jesus Christ went with the disciples to the Mount of jemane to pray and that's where Judas betrays him and takes these Pharisees they betray him and sell him you know then PA forgive me Peter also betrays him and he betrays him by denying him denies him both of them but the difference was this that Peter Knew by Revelation that Jesus Christ was the son of the Living God he could get close and seek Jesus's face he could be humble and ask for forgiveness look both of them to Judas the devil came inside him and I believe also came inside Peter the devil got inside him when the Lord Jesus begins to reveal to them it was necessary to return to Jerusalem to be crucified Peter takes some takes some on a on a walk and tells him don't do that avoid that that's when the Lord Jesus tell him apart from me Satan the devil asked for Peter to sift him but Peter had the Revelation he knew the one inside him is greater than the one in the world he knew that Jesus was the son of the living that was the difference it's necessary to draw closer to him see what brother brandham says the Devil is a real smart shrewd bird in the message the Third Exodus the devil is real smart shrewd bird he knows how to hit the thing before it gets started he knows it see and the only thing that you can ever do to beat him is rely on Christ and humble yourself and let him lead you see you'll never do it any other way your intellectual Powers will never do it you've got to believe it just rely on him he's the shepherd it ain't the Sheep's business to keep the wolf away it's the shepherd's business but the Sheep must stay with the Shepherd in order to stay safe that's my safety zone is in Christ and Christ is the word that's the safety zone Peter he knew Who The Shepherd of Shepherd was he knew it wasn't so much his business but he had to wait and only trust and that's how Peter did he waited Drew nigh he drew closer to him he humbled himself he sought the Lord's face in comparison to Judas Judas decided to take his own route he decided to do it his way he decided to take his life and it calls my attention what the scripture says here look after Judas betrays him with a kiss the Lord calls him friend I believe Jesus got to love Judas to call him a friend I believe he loved him because in the Lord Jesus Christ there cannot be anything else other than love but sometimes we betray him we betray what he's given us we betray every one of his blessings we betray his promises and even then he still loves us even then he still considers us friends we sell our time that time that should be his that time we should spend close to him we betrayed for a pile of coins but even then he calls us friend Brothers I believe he loves us let's draw closer to him draw closer to him let's be more humble there's nothing impossible for him if he could forgive even Peter after denying him but your attitude counts a lot also God bless [Applause] you amen [Music] we GRE you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's no need why to be far from him if he is here with us I asked myself if the Lord Jesus Christ in his glorified body in any case came this morning cross those doors stand in this pulpit and would tell me son I will preach What attitude would we have what expect would we live how would we get of glad for myself I at least sit on the first bench and I would say Lord I want to hear you because you have what I need your word is life and there's really no reason why I live this morning our title draw closer draw closer to him invitation for you this morning the scripture says in Psalms 329 says a little blunt like this but it's the truth this is God's word be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding this is how we are sometimes whose mouth must be held in with bit and BR Britt bit and brittle who doesn't know who bit or brittle is it's it's a mouthpiece you put on the the horse or the mule so you can hold him from there so you can control it and the scripture says let us not be that way that we need a brittle we need a bit he can pull us towards him says L they come near unto thee many times times we need something like the preacher this morning said why wait why wait something come to you why wait for a bad news and be told you have cancer or you have so many days left that's a bit that's a brittle of the Lord many times he uses that to draw Us near him because we believe the Son of God if he is predestinated he cannot be lost sooner or later God will return you why go so far if he is so close he wants you to come to to him in such a way that you get much closer to him in such a way that you begin to rid of yourself the more you get closer to the Sun you begin to in in simple words I'm sorry you begin to melt I begin to disappear more and I begin to fuse a little more if we got close enough this flesh would dissolve and we would become him and that's the entire purpose that you get close enough so that this flesh melts or disolves that you let go of your desires you let go of your evil hearts that you begin to get close to him close enough that you see yourself in him I believe something that sooner later the worshipper turns into what he worships I repeat that the worshiper sooner or later will turn into what he worships you come to worship Him you surrender to Jesus Christ like the everything for you you dedicate your life to him sooner or later you will become him if you dedicate to your wife to women to the world sooner or later you will you will be with a lot of women if you dedicate to your job you devote to your job you get you dive into what you like sooner or later you will become that you become what you are worshiping I want to surrender to him enough brother I can become more like to be less like me less of me and more of him less of me and more of him that I wi so that he can grow in me the invitation that's why he prays in this tremendous prayer he makes John 1720 and he prays in this manner neither pray I for these alone for who the apostles for for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word who are they that's you and I the Lord is praying and say neither do I pray only for these but I pray for those that are to come he was praying for me brother he was praying for you and what is this prayer that they all may be [Music] one as thou father in me are in me and I in thee Jesus says I and the father are one and in few words I was trying to find a word that describes this and what I found out is this word or term Fusion the word Fusion is a change of of state is changing from a solid state and then turns into a liquid and the best example of that it's like a glass you have a glass with he is the Water of Life Living Water many times we're like this cold piece of ice you deposit in the water what happens that ice cube that ice cube fuses joins with the water then they're no longer two now it's only one enough you got close enough submer in the water that you melt a little bit of few falls off every time you get closer to him there's less of you and you begin to reflect him more [Applause] [Music] I don't know if this excites you a little because he's already here why live far from him the scripture says that they also may be one in US that in them who's them that's us this is the prayer Jesus is that you and I can be one with them that's what the scripture says because he and the father were one and he says let them be one with us for what um that the [Music] world may believe that thou has sent me did you understand there's a purpose a reason why Jesus is praying and he wants you to be one with him and he says for what so the world can believe the only way the world will believe that he did come is that he be through you the people cannot believe he came and resurrected when you are not one with him you are not close enough to the word or you haven't ate the word and you have not become word because when you come to the word and you eat of the word you become word and that's Jesus's worry that he wants us to come to this un that we draw close enough to him that we can become one so the world can believe in him there's no other way amen amen that's the reason when Earth gets close enough to the Sun it produces life don't fall asleep brother stay here when the earth we see that easily in Colorado we have winter everything is dead and dry but once the Earth spins and gets closer to the Sun closer to the Sun Life blooms again amen amen that's why we are lifeless that's why we are fruitless many times because we're not close enough to him but why don't you get close to him this morning why not get more closer a little bit more brother get closer to him he won't reject you our Pastor said even when Adam sinned God did not miss his appointment he keeps coming to you why Brethren because he simply loves us so we are his children he comes to us maybe the condition wasn't the best and he began to flee because his sin pricked him that's why you don't get close sometimes but I don't think there's such a great sin that my God can't forgive you know at the end of accounts the problem the problem I see here we want to impress god with works with something that I can do but you cannot impress God Jes impressed him for me Jesus impressed him for me he already did everything the grade that we can give Jesus when God calls Jesus and see Jesus's grades A+ and he sees A+ everywhere A+ just A+ everywhere Jesus's great are mine in other words when I get to heaven and they call me show me his grace let me tell you I have an A I have straight A because I don't have to impress he impressed him for me all I have get a little closer a little closer brother so you fuse you join with him does the scripture not say he is the life he's the vine we are the branches inserted from the vine so I was a wild Branch but when I joined the vine part of the Vine I am him that is Unity that he is searching for if we get close enough we become one with him you come to be him that's why in adoption says when the son becomes adopted when the son becomes adopted brother William he can sign the check oh hallelujah oh [Applause] Hallelujah because his signature is as good as the father father belongs to the son he becomes one with the father that is adoption his signature is as good as the father's you cannot dive into the water and come out dry you get in the water and come out wet you cannot get in with a supernatural and keep being fleshly you become Supernatural if you truly draw to him your nature will be his nature you cannot come to the Holy Spirit you cannot come to the Holy Spirit and continue being caral if you get close to the Holy Spirit you become spiritual and holy if you are caral you have not gone close enough come to him this morning get a little closer if you get close to the word you become word the worshipper becomes what he worships amen amen that word Fusion or that you are one is described in 2 Corinthians 3:18 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory the more you admire him the more you see his glory you are being transformed to what you are seeing reflect like a mirror and when you see the mirror I don't see myself I see him when you get close enough to him and become one with him the people see you people can see Jesus walking and you are one with him so whatever you say that happens we can make worlds God said let there be light and there was light why because he is [Music] God if the light never came then God never spoke but when God speaks things happen he said let there be light and there was light but my question is if we are his children if we are God's children what are we aren't we also creators no aren't we are we creators you can create the right atmosphere or the wrong atmosphere and this morning you decide where you're headed where do you want to go what do you desire the decision is put before you this morning you can make the correct atmosphere for you to obtain your new birth we are creators we can make a world and go live in it that's what the prophet said we can make a world and go live in it many times that's what I've done you know when things aren't going smooth Maybe life circumstances have led us to have many problems full of illnesses full of problems and there we are but the Son of God has power to make a world and go live in it by faith brother everything around you is falling and I come and make my own world and I say everything is well where I am everything is well maybe around me the circumstances are difficult but I've made a world by the faith I've been given and I've gone to live in there and that's where I am in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus there I hide inable Rock nobody move me there nobody can take me out of there nobody because I myself have made that because of what I believed and it's scriptural you say brother that's a lie do you remember Elisha Elisha lived in a different world Jessie Jesse could not see and he said we're surrounded we're surrounded we're finished the case is over and the prophet Elisha Rises Lord Open the Eyes of My servants so that he can see is next to us if he is with us who can be against us why do you keep running away from him brother and get close to him there was a man reading his Bible and theologians came and asked him what are you doing you may stand brother musicians can come they asked him what are you doing this man maybe barely knew how to read and he said I'm reading the Bible and they were very arrogant and asked him and what are you reading fellow in other words you don't even understand he said I'm reading the book of Revelation and they said oh well you believe do you understand can you explain that to me he said well all that I understand that at the end we [Applause] win we're on the right side why are you running away come to The Winning Side get closer to him if you get close enough brother you will be the problems won't matter the sickness won't matter doesn't matter what you go through are on The Winning Side we are sure in him and only in him let us pray father thank you Lord bless your children Lord
