finishing for finn oh finally [Music] and i believe that we'll also be speaking on the titanic since i won't be here the these the next few wednesdays [Music] this will be one of my last item church messages and i want to speak on the morning star the reward of the overcomer in the dietary [Music] especially this book of revelations it's for the brightest in time the book of revelation is the bride del tiempo but the book of revelations is especially for you in time it's for all of the bride special apocalypse but there's something special for us in the book of revelation somos parte de he that overcometh and keepeth my works into the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broke into shivers even as i received of my father established he's speaking on authority lo primero the first thing he'll give you is authority in english it is power this and now he says that he who gives do he keeps he who keeps doing his works faithfully until the end will be given power it will be given power over nations will be strong and capable who can cope so powerfully with any situation that even the most desperate russia it's much greater it's much greater it's much greater than what can be obtained of the kingdoms of this earth it's a power and how that is on seduction or seducing hacies that's how he control he gets to control us he seduces us [Music] the devil controls me influence you have the influence that she had and then she controlled the people of israel through the power of seduction she was she could seduce the people she had to be able to seduce the people through fornication everything she was doing [Music] the way she feels as long as he can seduce is not based god obtains over his oh um that only the bride of the lord jesus will be able to obtain or have it's a true power a that even the most desperate enemy will be broken if need be his demonstration of rule by power will be like unto the very sons the son of god yes and he came back to life [Music] he said to let him go and then they let him go he had power over death [Music] it doesn't need uh seduction [Applause] [Music] [Music] yes sir thank you god this is the first thing i'll give you verse 28 says and i will give him the morning star two things i'm going to read what brother branham says in the church ages book uh it says until the day dawn of the the day star arises in your heart second peter 1 19. the spirit is making a promise to to the the people of the dark ages relating to himself is [Music] even lucifer satan himself we know the book of isaiah calls him the star of the morning the star of the morning tambien of the morning uh they were appraising or worshiping god cuando diosponia los fundamentos de la tierra when he laid the foundations of the earth so we see that that term the morning star is not only used for our lord jesus but one thing that is very different is that an apocalypse that in the book of revelation he says i'm the ruling offspring of david this is the bright and morning star in england in english it says el diablo and the devil appears to be as a lion trying to devour so he tries to attribute the same characteristics that god has el trata de tener los amiens he tries to have them as well el mundo the world the world and his power in the morning or in the beginning he is the the brightest morning star the scientists have a certain way to describe it but i'm going to focus on what brother branham has to say about it because before the sun arises in the thai and church age they say las cosas he says the things of god were to the lowest point at that time and it appeared that satan was going to conquer the people of god it says if ever a people needed a promise embracing the land where there is no night it was the people of the dark ages and that is why the spirit is promising them the morning star el es estadi siendo que la estrella he will not be using the stars or messengers to give light in the dirt any longer it will be jesus himself speaking to them face to face as he shares his kingdom with them it is the morning star that is visible when the light of the sun commences to shine the light of the world will become brighter and brighter in our perfect day a dark time in our if you are able this a cersei to do

notice the very teaching of nature this nature if you want to see god god is in his great nature and god is great of a morning i believe it was the prophet isaiah one time he said washington what are the nights he said the night cometh in the morning this is always before the daylight it's the darkness for god is about to make a change to come to our lives the [Music] god allows darkness in our lives is or give a birth to something yes to a new life [Music] it was about to break something lieutenant luther would come around something that hadn't been done for 1500 years the the light of the morning was the sun was going to come and break the darkness out of the catholic church over christianity and he would begin there is something some greater [Music] [Applause] [Music] get [Music] i don't want to be what i'm prideful off [Music] or that i hold on to so much excuse me i believe he's speaking of the lord jesus christ that is the lord jesus in every morning star yes able to see how
