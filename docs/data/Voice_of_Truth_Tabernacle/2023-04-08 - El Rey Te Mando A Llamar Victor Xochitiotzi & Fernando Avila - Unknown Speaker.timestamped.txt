[27:04] let's read second Samuel chapter 21
[27:07] verse 7.
[27:10] this is and it reads
[27:13] foreign
[27:29] because the Lord's oath that was between
[27:32] them between David and Jonathan the son
[27:35] of Saul
[27:39] may take your seats brother
[27:45] a
[27:51] Mundo
[27:53] Catholicism I know that Catholicism
[27:57] today celebrate
[28:03] crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ
[28:08] we
[28:14] believe that our Lord Jesus Christ
[28:16] Resurrected
[28:24] because we see that God Brothers
[28:45] this place
[28:48] is
[29:02] I hope that's okay if I share a little
[29:05] what they shared
[29:09] and some time ago Brothers
[29:20] I remember I was at the door seating
[29:23] brothers
[29:29] and we were in The Meditation before
[29:31] starting the service
[29:35] [Music]
[29:37] I'm not sure if it was my ears
[29:40] everyone heard it
[29:43] pero
[29:45] yo yo what I heard
[29:53] songs from Angelic songs
[30:02] because it's always been in my mind
[30:09] we're standing before the Lord Jesus
[30:11] Christ is
[30:24] something tremendous
[30:27] dios and I believe that God ill he no
[30:31] says
[30:33] here's what we sing amen
[30:36] Hermanos dios I believe burden that God
[30:39] this is
[30:44] working on the Samaritan woman
[30:51] saying it was necessary to go through
[30:54] just for one Soul amen all right
[30:57] [Music]
[31:00] and in this moment I tell you
[31:03] that the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:15] I'm not sure how you came this is
[31:41] amen
[31:51] he
[31:52] is
[31:53] and I titled this preaching
[31:56] the king calls for you
[32:03] I'm not sure brother but the Bible says
[32:10] that when David took the throne
[32:25] his friend's name was Jonathan
[32:30] and when he remembered this oath
[32:33] he asked
[32:42] if anyone who is alive
[32:48] and his son
[32:57] no one left alive
[33:02] Nino and the Bible says this child
[33:06] many people said mephibosheth
[33:09] is
[33:16] uh
[33:19] in a place called loader bar
[33:23] is
[33:27] many of us are found in that place many
[33:30] times
[33:33] I found alone amen you know say Lucas
[33:38] not sure what you're seeking on this day
[33:50] he will find him brethren
[33:52] is
[33:57] or I can tell you brother if you came
[33:59] searching for God
[34:04] there it is
[34:30] foreign
[35:04] brethren
[35:37] foreign
[35:52] the Bible says this uh this uh young man
[35:56] was lame
[35:58] he couldn't walk
[36:02] amen
[36:05] he didn't have a way to earned life
[36:17] the son of Saul
[36:24] everything belonged to him that David
[36:27] had
[36:32] this young man
[36:36] the Bible says
[36:44] maybe his clothes
[36:48] maybe his clothes were tornote Hermanos
[36:52] because he didn't have a way
[36:56] after himself
[36:59] foreign
[37:08] amen
[37:28] I I believe maybe
[37:31] because maybe he thought they'd kill him
[37:33] amen amen
[37:40] he wasn't expecting the great surprise
[37:43] they had for him
[37:49] and
[37:51] it says when they bring this young man
[37:53] before David
[37:59] this is
[38:04] fearful before the king
[38:06] it is
[38:08] and it says that King David
[38:12] told him to not fear
[38:14] foreign
[38:28] that I would never forget
[38:34] of the House of Saul amen amen
[38:44] and when he begins to say
[38:54] he was the one that had to be in the
[38:56] throne David was using
[38:59] and he says
[39:14] and he says

[41:18] father in his throne

[48:56] I began with a pain in my knee
[49:03] the doctors told me I might need surgery
[49:07] the um
[49:11] I'm not sure what happened with my knee
[49:14] or how it happened but
[49:16] that's why you might see me limping a
[49:19] little bit
[49:23] last week
[49:26] a sister saw me limping
[49:30] and from far they said oh I feel bad
[49:34] and I wanted to turn and say I feel bad

[51:26] [Music]
[52:18] from his legs
[52:23] [Music]
[52:46] Luke 12 32 says
[52:51] the Bible says
[52:59] if you're not a little flock for it is
[53:02] your father's good pleasure to give you
[53:04] the kingdom amen
[53:06] when God formed us
[53:09] with a purpose amen
[53:13] God didn't only give us life uh
[53:17] just to survive him
[53:23] that's what we need just to survive
[53:39] sometimes we make ourselves as small
[53:42] make ourselves less
[53:45] [Music]
[53:47] we live with a pointless purpose
[53:51] in other words
[53:55] [Music]
[53:57] a purpose that we don't give the
[53:59] sacrifice
[54:05] move us
[54:21] [Music]
[55:06] James 4 3 this is
[55:15] because you ask amiss
[55:23] what purpose are you at
[55:26] to satisfy your own flesh
[55:29] of a purposeless life
[55:33] we want to live how the world lives
[55:38] as we can say a temporary life
[55:53] that's the right intentions
[55:56] God wants to give us our healing maybe
[55:59] but sometimes we don't even ask for them
[56:07] for a better job
[56:19] things
[56:23] foreign
[57:20] thou son of David
[57:23] have mercy upon me
[57:25] and the multitude
[57:34] [Music]
[57:38] have mercy upon me
[57:41] says that Jesus Christ Jesus called him
[57:45] and told him
[57:48] what do you want from me Jesus Jesus
[57:51] stop
[57:53] what do you want from me
[58:00] so return myself
[58:03] [Music]

[59:22] [Music]
[1:00:00] [Music]
[1:00:23] [Music]
[1:00:33] [Music]
[1:00:43] and the focus from our purpose
[1:01:14] we believe our vision is
[1:01:42] Elijah for a double portion
[1:01:48] is preaching Elijah and Elisha Lisa he
[1:01:53] says El dijo he said
[1:01:58] that a double portion of your spirit
[1:02:02] that's the way
[1:02:04] don't be scared
[1:02:11] you have not because
[1:02:14] because you asked now
[1:02:17] you ask not because
[1:02:30] [Music]
[1:02:33] that's right
[1:02:40] [Music]
[1:03:08] a brand new car movies
[1:03:13] my vision is have a better job
[1:03:19] Luke 12 32 says
[1:03:28] your father's good pleasure
[1:03:31] is
[1:03:33] why do you settle with only with the
[1:03:36] flesh
[1:03:41] the purposes
[1:03:58] will be added onto
[1:04:01] Israel
[1:04:04] Israel was in bondage for many years
[1:04:16] that they got used to not having Allah
[1:04:28] I believe they prayed with a
[1:04:31] smaller with a mentality that was
[1:04:36] a mind that was limited
[1:04:38] I believe they got to the point
[1:04:43] that they pray to be better
[1:04:46] than to be delivered
[1:04:54] honey and milk flow
[1:04:58] sometimes we don't have foreign
[1:05:08] [Music]
[1:05:29] sometimes we make God small
[1:05:32] s
[1:05:33] we make God so small
[1:05:36] it's our own vision is small
[1:05:41] nothing
[1:05:42] [Music]
[1:05:44] we don't let God work through us
[1:05:48] the message faith is our victory
[1:05:53] now there's so many people
[1:05:57] that doesn't seem to have any kind of
[1:05:59] purpose in life
[1:06:02] especially in this day that we live
[1:06:08] to think that all they have to do is
[1:06:12] to keep up with something
[1:06:19] and with the enticements
[1:06:28] how can we do that
[1:06:30] how can God do that
[1:06:35] when we won't even stand still foreign
[1:06:56] it would be great
[1:07:00] God says
