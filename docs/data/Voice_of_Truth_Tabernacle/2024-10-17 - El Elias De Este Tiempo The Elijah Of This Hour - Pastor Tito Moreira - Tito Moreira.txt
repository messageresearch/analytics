everybody standing in their place of Duty mins did a great job the song leaders everybody that was working in the work of the lord we are blessed brethren we are a blessed people amen amen ration 3:4 and to the angel of the Church of Lans right these things say the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God let us pray heavenly father while we pray to you Lord as a congregation we have prayed personally Lord but we need to unite together it doesn't take of one Minister only or just the pastor requires a whole congregation to be United in the same mind in your Same Spirit Lord so not only do I pray for myself but for every brother that's here tonight may we receive what you have for every one of us that every one of us join your holy spirit that we're not walking walking according to the flesh but walking according to the spirit because we want to be seated in Heavenly places with your word we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you may all take your seats on Friday if God allows or Sunday we have a video and at the end of the service brother Felix and brother Fernando will be speaking a little bit since for I just want to focus a few minutes on what we've been speaking on Wednesday how many love the word of the Lord Brothers how many of you like to learn about this topic especially the church age we're speaking of because it's the church age the time speaking of the calendar the time which was our turn to live yes or yes the age of L the seventh Church age the seventh age that's the age you and I live in it belongs to us and we can identify and we can see ourselves in the scripture do are you interested in are you interested in KN what which Angel was for you which message was for you if God sent something for me I want it I'm gonna say it again if God sent something for me I want it and God sent it through an angel God sent a message through an angel for this age for this time God doesn't speak to the church God speaks to the angel of the church does not speak to the church speak to the angel of the church thanks God we follow the angel of the Church of the age of laa there are people without the message because they haven't found out which the what is or which is the angel of this age they base themselves on previous Angels or previous evangelists that have come but it's important to identify the angel of this age to know the message that God sent for us if you don't know the angel you cannot receive his message and God will not send the message to the church God has a way of working and the way he works is he chooses one man who to speak and this man takes the message to the church do we agree till now if not they will be another preaching another time and until the angel of the Church of Lans write for those that have been reading or listening to the the preaching by brother brandham you know brother brandom says I won't read it because I have other things to read hopefully you're reading the message of the age of you understand that's your homework right you should be reading one of those messages one of the messages you should be reading is the age of lcia and brother Bram says a me the messenger would be one like Elijah I want to take that and support it with the word of God with the Bible there's a messenger for this time brother BR says he would be like Elijah uh now it's important to know that the seventh messenger is special you know God works in patterns God works in patterns and he says he's Alpha and Omega and there's something important about the beginning of something and the end of something else that's why he says I'm Alpha and Omega a is the first letter of the alphabet in the Greek GA Omega is the last the alphabet I'm the beginning and I'm the end we see there's something special about what God does in the end we can see it in the creation the first day the second day third day we see how God was advancing repeat God is advancing that's his pattern that's his way the sixth day day arrives he says let us make man what did he do did he do the most important first no he was advancing something happened in the beginning yes that's very similar with what happened in the end we'll speak later about that because we can see the logos on the first day we can see it on the sixth day when he made a man but God is advancing and God begins to culminate all things in the end the seventh messenger is not the same like the rest he's similar to the first which we know which one was the first messenger PA Paul Paul was a prophet irus Wesley up to Wesley we not prophets but the seventh we saw it last time the seventh is a prophet so there's something special about the seventh there's something that God wants to do now one of the reasons that the seventh angel is very important because he introduces the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ he's the one that gives a transition repeat he makes the transition to what's next now another age isn't next what's next the coming of the Lord that's what's next so it's not a easy responsibility responsibility it's a big responsibility and God needed somebody great is that right the Bible says that God did the same in his first coming before his first coming God sent an Elijah repeat before the first coming God sent an Elijah need three times to hear it some don't hear the first time did you know that the first time like we didn't realize what was told repeat in the before repeat before the first coming God sent an Elijah let's say it again before the first coming God s and Elijah we will see that that Elijah was John the Baptist and the Bible says that from all the prophets from all of God's men Jesus Christ said in there had not been a man like John the the greatest until that time was John the APAP if that was in his first coming why would it not be like that the second time we're waiting for his second coming right so I believe God was going to send a great man not just anybody now the Jewish the Jewish have Elijah at the same level with Abraham and Moses the three men that the Jews honor and hold very high are Abra Moses and Elijah and you would say why Elijah why this man Elijah did you know that the Jews honor Elijah so much that every Passover they have this Feast called the Passover they prepare the table and always leave an empty chair when they're going to have the Passover and a wine glass on the table and that chair that's empty is because they wait for Elijah and they leave the door open they leave the door open they leave an empty chair and they leave a wine glass and the door open is for Elijah it's not necessarily for Elijah to walk in they're waiting for the Messiah you know the Jews still wait for the Messi and they know what we're about to read they know Elijah must come before the Messiah does this is not something that only we believe the Jews have believed it since the Old Testament because the Old Testament finishes speaking that before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord God will send elij the prophet let's read it there in Malachi 4 Malachi 4 now to some of you this might just be a summary or just a review but I believe there's some here that haven't heard it we greet everybody watching through the internet we have people inan and Peru California that I know of Phoenix and also our brothers in Phoenix Phenix that are connected right now and may God bless them let's read Malachi 4 verse1 and on for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven all the proud and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch speaking about a special [Music] day it's not speaking like of a day let's say of October 16 but it's also speaking about a period of time called the day of the Lord the day of the Lord or Jehovah repeat the day of Jehovah the day of Jehovah we just read it are you reading your Bible yes you're here you're present yes the day of Jehova shall burn as an oven it's not a nice day right well for the wicked it's not a nice thing for the children of God verse two says but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and you shall go forth and grow up as Cals of the stall and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your foot feet in the day that I shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him in ARB for all Israel with the statutes and judgments behold I I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord the day of the Lord is great and Dreadful it's a day where God Will Take Action take action against the proud against the wicked against the devil against sin the day the Lord will bring his judgments to this earth now I ask you did this day happen already I'm not talking about 24 hours I'm talking about a space of time or a period of time did it happen already has earn burned has there been judgment has the sin disappeared appeared no right so that day hasn't happened thanks to God because he is extending his grace but verse five says behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet this is a little odd for you that haven't heard this before this is a little odd who is Elijah we find Elijah for the first time in First Kings chapter 17 now one and seven are very bound to Elijah if you notice [Music] first we find Elijah in First Kings 17 verse1 then we find John the Baptist with the spirit of Elijah in Luke 17 and then we see Jesus speaking of the Elijah that would come later in Matthew 17 and then we find out the seventh angel that would be an Elijah and Revelation 107 something that I think is not a coincidence First Kings 171 here's where the Bible introduces and we meet Elijah the Tish and Elijah the tipai who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be do nor reain these years but according to my word we see Elijah and in the age of laa brother brandham describes Elijah a little Elijah the Tish we see Elijah theb in the book of kings and we see his ministry what type of ministry what type of person he was I repeat it he was such an extraordinary character that the Jews the Jews have a chair specifically for him for Moses not for Abraham but for Elijah why number one because Elijah was the seventh I'm sorry the second person that was raptured in that way the first one we know was Enoch then we see Elijah and he was raptured also this is something extraordinary we listen to this like if this was old news we've heard it over and over too much but they knew Elijah was raptured alive that he was raptured alive it was a sudden Rapture if you read when Elijah the Tish was [Music] raptured we know that they were even speaking with they were still speaking with Elisha when all of a sudden there came a whirlwind and took him away on a chariot you [Music] remember this is something extraordinary so we know that Elijah elah Tish the original is tied to the Rapture repeat Elijah is tied the rapture we understand that read the story of Elijah tishbite we know after he was raptured a descended and we know it had the spirit of Elijah that l on Elish and El had the same works and wonders Miracles a similar [Music] Ministry like Elijah the tishbite did so we can see Elisha like the second Elijah repeat elishah was the second Elijah now I'm going to ask you a simple question was Elisha's name Elijah what was Elisha's name Elisha it's simple I'm not trying to trick you but the reason why I ask you that is because some people think if an Elijah will come in our age his name needs to be Elijah but we see it's not so it's the spirit of Elijah who is the holy spirit with Elijah's Ministry that would come through a man that man did not to be named Elijah he is his name could be William brandham what we do know not only Elisha had Elijah's spirit Elisha was Elijah's disciple but then he had Elijah [Music] Spirit but Luke 11:7 let's read it quickly Luke 117 the story of John the Baptist of John say the Baptist because that's what they called him because he baptized so we don't confuse him with John the disciple the loved or the Revelator but John the Baptist do you remember John the Baptist he was six months older than Jesus uh so his mother was pregnant six months before Mary was and before his mother Elizabeth was pregnant an angel appears to his father and this Angel tells his father Zachariah speaking about John this son that would come named John and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias repeat with the spirit and power spirit and power now was his name gonna be Elijah or Elias what was going to be his name ju John John would be his name but he would have the spirit and power of Elija just like Elijah just like just like Elijah and elsh in other words the same Ministry that Elish had that Elisha had a similar Ministry John the Baptist would also have are you with me now this is John the Baptist do you know a little of what John the Baptist did we know he baptized on the Jordan River for repentance but there was a special job he had and he would prepare or forerun the way for the Messiah prepare the way for the Lord Jesus Christ and we'll speak on that later also but he was Associated also with a coming with a coming of the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ I want to read something from the prophet here the message the Lan Church age speaking about Elijah TI not a learned person Elijah was not a learned person the John was not a learned person Luke 167 the Bible said that he was the child was as soon as he was born he took to the Wilderness was in the wilderness till the day he was showed to Israel that's right Luke 167 the 80th verse if you want to mark it down this Prophet will also be a moody sort of guy Elijah after he had a great meeting nobody could get along with him Elijah had spells when he went out there and called fire down out of heaven and burn up the altars of ba and everything he run Into the Wilderness and said Lord I'm no better than my fathers let me die is that right he sat under a juniper tree and after the great Revival now he wanted to die and John when they cast him in prison this foul woman he sat back there and began to get moody I believe P or one of them said his Eagle Eye got filed over in jail he sent some of his disciples and while he had declared in said there's the Lamb of God that takes away the the sin of the world John saw the pillar of fire hanging over him like a dove and come down settled upon Him witnessed it all and said that's the Lamb of God and said I have need to be baptized of you and why you coming to me Jesus said suffer it to be so now so now we see Elisha was similar to Elijah John the Baptist looked similar to Elijah so if another Elijah would come in our time you have to be similar or look similar to Elijah the prophet also are you with me brother had to be the same Spirit and the same power now let's read Matthew 17 Matthew 17 from verse 10 and on these are scriptures the majority of you know but we always need to review the these to make sure we're on the same page Matthew 1710 chapter 17 of Matthew speaks to us of a Transfiguration of the Lord Jesus Christ it was a special event that happened we know that God took the three of them who were they we heard it what two weeks ago Peter James and John when God was going to do something great he would take Peter James and John and he took them with him and there he appeared I'm sorry there appeared Moses and Elijah his face like the sun repeat his face like the sun now his face or countenance like the sun we're going to see speaks about the day of the Lord about the day of the Lord but the thing is that they saw this scene and when the scene ended Moses and Elijah disappeared and all of that happened and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must come must first come they were a bit confused up to that moment the disciples didn't not have Mark MTH the New Testament did not exist the Bible they did have was from Genesis to Malachi less books 39 books let's say 39 books they had and they knew very well that elah had to come before the great and Dreadful day so then they're asking where's Elijah thou are the Messiah and it looks like the day of the of the Lord is not so where is Elijah or why were we preached to for so long scries the Pharisees and all the Jews that Elijah need to come first they were a little confused this wasn't making sense to them they knew Malachi 45 and6 very well it was a scripture that was They Knew by heart that Elijah they were waiting for Elijah did you know the Jews they have Elijah as very interesting character many rabbis tell that they seen Elijah they write in their that elah has appeared and has shown them certain things um some see as he appears in one way and in a different [Music] way these are well recognized rabbis that say they've seen Elijah because God kind of uses Elijah in different forms but either way they knew and believed to their own way of thinking sooner later Elijah the Tish needs to return to announce the coming of the Messiah that's why today they leave the door open it's not for him to walk in necessarily but they know when Elijah returns they want to run out and meet him as soon as possible so they leave the door open so they can be prepared to go and meet Elijah that's how strongly they're waiting for Elijah so it's not a surprise that they would ask this question so long we've been waiting for him what happened here we're leaving the door open to meet him and if wants to walk in and drink some wine he has a chair ready but they were waiting for Elijah very strongly so their question does not surprise us verse 11 and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall come first and restore all things repeat Elias truly shall first come and restore all things this is speaking future tense not past tense here's where the denominations get confused because they think churches normally teach that verse 11 and 12 speak of the same one but verse 11 is speaking on someone coming in the future and verse 12 is speaking of somebody that already came verse 11 up to that point had not happened but verse 12 had already happened there two different people verse 11 is speaking of a future Elijah elas truly shall first come in English I like how it says it better shall it first come and restore all things you cannot put that in past tense that Elijah had not come yet the that would restore all things but Jesus tells them Elias shall come first and then he throws them a curve ball and he tells them to confuse them a little more but I say unto you that Elias is is come already now this is another Elijah one will come and one came verse 11 is an Elijah that shall first come and 12 is one that came already then he says but have oh I'm sorry and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall the son of man suff suffer of them I don't know about you I might not understand Hebrew like my first tongue but I think we need Revelation to understand what he said and I believe that's what they received in verse 13 because Jesus doesn't tell them that was John the Baptist he left it like a mystery well thanks to God that his bride will understand they understood then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John the Baptist I imagine they began to speak between them what is the Lord talking about here and one of them must have said I think he means John the Baptist because John the Baptist meets all the requirements Jesus didn't have to tell them I believe it's the same thing in this time there are people as much that you prove to them that William Bram meets all requirements there are people that will never see it but there will be people see brother William bram's life and will notice or find out by Revelation that the Elijah that would come was brother brandham it needs to be a revelation brother verse 11 Elias truly shall first come first before what because if he's speaking of something first speaking of something that's going to happen before and it's the same thing we read in Malachi 4 behold I sent you the prophet Elias before the great and Dreadful day before the great and Dreadful day brother Bram says in the age ofia John the Baptist was an Elijah we all agree right the Bible told us we just read it John the Baptist was an Elijah but the great and Dreadful day of the Lord come after John the Baptist no it didn't the Earth hasn't burned yet the judgments haven't fallen on the earth the Great day of the Lord has not happened yet so Malachi 45 is not speaking of John the Baptist speaking of the future Elijah to come so will there be an Elijah before the great and Dreadful day well let's stop there please stand I there's many ways to identify that brother brandham is the Elijah of this time there's so many [Music] identifications if you look for it you'll find it we see the first Elijah the tishbite controlling nature that's the first thing we read about him is that he's controlling the nature he says there will not be rain according to my word that's something that was special about Elijah he was controlling nature and we know that even here in Colorado we see our present Elijah that stopped a storm that's not it that's not the only thing we see but greater things than that but that fall in line with Elijah's Ministry restoring the altar introducing the true God that's what Elijah did he says I'm going to prove to you who the real God is you remember you don't when he had a Revival he had a Revival with all the denominations yes brother brandham says he gathered all the denominations all the false prophets and prove who the real God was that's the same thing John the Baptist did John the Baptist introduced the true Messiah the true word of God and in our time we had an Elijah rival after Revival proving who the real God was we could last a week speaking about similarities of William brandham and Elijah tishbite but God has brought us our Elijah already and may God reveal to us that it settles in our [Music] heart don't believe just because the pastor says don't believe just because a good preacher say go and find out yourself make sure messenger for this day is don't believe it just cuz your father does just cuz your mother does go and do your own investigating go and know the messenger God sent you for your time God promised and he has fulfilled his word now it's necessary that we the Elijah of our time amen God bless you brother [Music] speee [Music] spee live [Music] oh [Music] no come [Music] see [Music] he the Lord n has [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] toe Lord [Music] the [Music] the [Music] [Music] foree hey [Music] take he made the the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Mee he [Music] your me the Lord [Music] [Music] a ro isus you're conf and so [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] me fore [Music] [Music] [Music] and so [Music] [Music] [Music] be [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] internet I'm not going to sing cuz last time I sang the internet broke you may be seated God bless you Brethren brother Titus asked me if I wanted to and if I could share a few things from Uruapan with you first of all it was a blessing to go to and me every one of the brothers there a long time [Music] coming it was a blessing to go and meet the people the brothers it was my first time going to Mexico after 19 years the last time I went the last time I went to Mexico was when we have an uh accident and uh with my family that was the last time Titus asked me how do you see Mexico now since then and I said it looks better today because the last time I came there was cars on fire next to the road burnt cars burnt cars next to the road and there was a lot of crosses and this time it look very different from what I saw it the last time I was there it was a very good experience for me it was my first time going to Oran like I said After experiencing this trip with brother Fernando his wife and my wife and our pastor and other brothers that went with us it was a blessing I want to thank brother Edgar and his wife sister Blanca for opening the doors of their home to us it was a blessing to get to know them more and stay with them on Saturday brother Titus asked us toh share something during the service impossibility impossible that can be possible and I believe in this time there's a lot of cases like that that we think that there's many things that can't be possible but they can be possible and it's if you believe not depending on what's happening but it's on how much you trust God or believe in God that's what the our theme was and I was thinking and meditating about something as we were sharing about Abraham that day Abraham waited 10 years 25 Abraham waited 25 years for the promise of God to come and sometimes we get tired over waiting one day we we wait one day and we say well but if you wait and believe and keep believing God can make it possible doesn't matter how impossible it looks God bless you and thank you for your prayers it was a beautiful experience to meet all the brothers in Uruapan amen we're very happy to be back um it just me not because I didn't enjoy over there but for my legal status the devil puts things in our way or in the mind of of in our minds and he makes it [Music] difficult I don't want to get too much into detail on my experience at the airport but I fought struggled and fought and battled against the enemy just to tell you that my fight from s from Denver to San Diego never took off and the battle started since then I want to thank my wife she never lost courage never lost hope never lost faith that's what motivated me to continue we spent over two days at the airport but thanks to God we were able to go and return with God's help I'm happy with God with my pastor and the support uh the paperwork wasn't easy but thanks to to God and my pastor The Impossible was made possible um we were in the theme of uran in uran believing the impossible it was a theme the people inan had to listen and I was able to share with brother Felix on Saturday I shared a few stories in the Bible where the impossible was made possible Felix Felix brother Felix shared his testimony that was a true [Music] blessing also the preaching of brother Vidal and our pastor the following day we know that Souls were delivered people were restored and healed we know we have a family there we want to thank for all their attentions towards us and if I get more into detail tell you of more than 50 plates they served us over there they overfed us and it was a true blessing have gone you already know how they treat you over there the ones that haven't gone yet I encourage you maybe there's some that can't [Music] go but your support is not in vain with the pastor with the money or helping with money all of that is worth it to see the situation how they live over there I'm not going to feel pity for the Breen because I feel pity for the [Music] devil over there it's a different world I see how the children live don't live stuck to their cell phones my wife and I can share that we played more than four hours playing volleyball with them nonstop even the children forgot to use the restroom they had so much fun so the brothers ended up joining the game it was a great blessing one more time we thank uran the Church of Uruapan for all their love and attention to my pastor Pastor that without you none of this would be possible and my wife and I returned home with the desire and the hope to be able to go back there and if I can share to you a little of my legal status on the trip we [Music] made I was able to acquire a legal entry to the United States through the marriage with my wife I'll be able to receive residency that right now is from about two months to two years through the Journey of six months so we hope in God and trus in God that next year we can return toan God bless you [Applause] brotherr amen one of the things that I can see how God places everything in order is that truly we didn't need to be fando well he went because that was the dates they approved for brother Fernando to go um but our brother called brother he said on that day he felt he said he's been many years just listening to the tapes but he said on that day he felt to speak to the people of the church because he wanted to go to church he didn't know we were there but on that day he said I want to go to that church and that's the day we were there and that's he told us that he wanted me to be his Pastor so I believe God placed everything in order I didn't plan it so may God bless you um brother Ed's birthdays and to the brothers in as well hopefully we'll show in the videos but they have some built bathrooms for those who knew there wasn't any bathrooms in the chch we had to use a brother brother we have some bathrooms and the brothers have better bathrooms than what we have here in for Collins but if we follow this [Music] pattern they had a for us so hopefully we'll have better bathrooms soon amen your support has not been in vain they are working they're putting in their effort in a great way I tell brother Edgar God made us good partners to work together alongside each other so we are happy we're going to be being dismissed uh there is an announcement next Friday or this Friday we'll have uh food by donation this Friday it'll be to support the
