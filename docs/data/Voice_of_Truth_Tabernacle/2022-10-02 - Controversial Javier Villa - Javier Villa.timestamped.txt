[41:27] says 2 26.
[41:34] I'm a back Christian Brothers
[41:38] Glass is off to read and I put them on
[41:41] to read
[41:43] it is
[42:01] then set Jesus and to his disciples If
[42:03] any man will come after me let him deny
[42:05] himself and take up his cross and follow
[42:07] me
[42:13] for whosoever will save his life shall
[42:16] lose it and whoever will lose his life
[42:18] for my sake shall find it
[42:22] Alma
[42:26] okay
[42:28] for what man what is a man profited if
[42:31] he shall gain the whole world and lose
[42:33] his own soul or what shall a man give in
[42:35] exchange for his soul let us pray
[42:39] we thank you this morning
[42:43] once again for your grace and mercy
[42:45] foreign
[43:26] thank you Lord for all things
[43:31] the Glorious name of the Lord Jesus
[43:33] Christ amen amen
[43:35] thank you
[43:39] Manana this morning
[43:44] I took this scripture
[43:48] because I want to take a very simple
[43:50] very basic a bit a very basic thoughts
[43:59] it's controversial
[44:02] or
[44:18] cause
[44:20] a discussion of something
[44:23] so the scripture we we read here
[44:27] the Lord is telling his disciples
[44:32] I want you to follow me at this moment
[44:35] the description we read
[44:38] the Lord is telling his disciples
[44:43] telling them something very basic very
[44:45] simple this is
[44:47] everyone wants to follow after me
[44:51] he asks them the questions
[44:54] number one is to deny yourself
[44:58] and follow me
[45:00] there's three very basic things
[45:04] two deniers itself is something very
[45:07] difficult
[45:09] because if we understand the word to
[45:12] deny yes yes
[45:18] deny yourself
[45:20] so to obtain your privileges from your
[45:23] privileges
[45:27] where the whole world is fighting for
[45:29] the rights and the whole world has
[45:32] rights
[45:34] inclusive here in the United States even
[45:36] the animals have rights even they have
[45:39] rights
[45:40] so the world is the rights
[45:45] because it was correspondent to us to
[45:48] live in this age
[45:49] that's what the Lord is saying Church
[45:51] age means it means
[45:53] the rights of the people
[45:56] and we're living in that time
[45:58] the whole world has rights
[46:01] but watch what the Lord Jesus says he
[46:04] says to deny yourself
[46:06] and that causes a controversy I'm in
[46:09] amen
[46:12] we started off wrong didn't we
[46:16] another thing the scripture says they
[46:19] say
[46:21] take up your cross
[46:23] number one is to deny yourself
[46:27] and then to take up your cross
[46:30] not the neighbor's Cross
[46:32] or the pastors but your own cross
[46:38] in other words
[46:42] your responsibility
[46:45] because what God has given you yes
[46:49] that's your responsibility that's your
[46:52] cross
[46:53] brother I don't have a Ministry
[46:56] you may not think so but um you have a
[47:00] calling or our ministry for God
[47:03] not everyone will be called to the same
[47:05] place or thing
[47:09] but what the Lord has called you to do
[47:12] you know say brother I'm not even
[47:15] married
[47:17] well you're you're you need to submit to
[47:20] your parents
[47:21] there's your responsibility
[47:24] when you're married
[47:25] you have more responsibility you have
[47:29] children
[47:29] for responsibility
[47:33] take up that responsibility take up that
[47:35] cross
[47:37] you understand
[47:39] just leave it there for a moment
[47:42] I don't want to awake too many
[47:46] and the difficulty thing is the
[47:49] following is
[47:50] first is to deny yourself take up your
[47:54] cross and then to follow
[47:57] that's the difficult so you're going to
[48:00] deny yourself you're going to deny your
[48:02] rights your privileges
[48:08] and then upon all that with all that
[48:11] it's not enough but then you got to
[48:13] follow Jesus Jesus what is the fall of
[48:16] Jesus
[48:17] took all the words
[48:21] the person comes to a moment in time
[48:25] where they are full of scars
[48:28] they
[48:30] have to follow the lord
[48:35] this is a controversial message
[48:39] so when Jesus says in the next verse
[48:44] because he who wants to save his life
[48:46] shall lose it
[48:49] everyone wants to save their life
[48:52] everyone wants to be right
[48:56] but Jesus said everyone who wants to
[48:59] save his life shall lose it
[49:00] and everyone
[49:03] for my sake or cause
[49:07] in other words
[49:13] the way the world says
[49:16] the religious world says it
[49:40] here's the religious world of that time
[49:43] against
[50:25] that system but there's no clue to
[50:27] Canada That's Why They Crucified the
[50:29] Lord
[50:30] won't you follow the law of Moses but
[50:34] what happens is
[50:46] he said it's not like that
[50:50] you painted the
[50:53] God got the wrong image difficult
[51:26] [Music]
[51:57] exactly the same thing
[52:03] religious world is
[52:07] you see it I'm not talking about an
[52:09] unbelieving people
[52:10] the religious world
[52:13] I have created a system
[52:25] he tells us what the word is
[52:29] it goes against their courage
[52:32] they can't accept it yeah
[52:38] it comes in a controversial
[52:46] ways his life
[52:50] because the controversial person
[52:52] you accept the message
[52:56] [Music]
[52:58] of the hour president it's difficult
[53:02] for a person
[53:33] [Applause]
[53:53] the current foreign
[54:19] [Music]
[54:26] you say brother
[54:29] explain to me how how that so
[54:33] we're going to go further into that
[54:37] let's read it Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes
[54:40] 8 verse 14.
[54:44] and here the the word says something to
[54:47] us very simple
[54:52] watch what the word says
[54:56] Ecclesiastes 14.
[55:03] the preacher says here
[55:08] there is Vanity which is done upon the
[55:10] Earth
[55:11] there'll be just men
[55:15] and to whom it happened according to the
[55:19] work of the wicked
[55:20] are you awake
[55:22] I'll repeat that
[55:25] there be just men again
[55:29] unto Whom It Happened according to the
[55:31] work of them
[55:37] to whom it happened is according to the
[55:39] work of the righteous
[55:41] I said that this is also vanity
[55:47] controversial this is something
[55:49] controversial amen amen
[55:52] how being a righteous man
[55:56] what would it happen to me like it like
[55:58] an unrighteous person a wicked person
[56:01] yeah that's the word brothers
[56:04] and those that behave us as a wicked
[56:07] person
[56:09] it happened to them as though they were
[56:11] righteous
[56:39] it's death
[57:19] but the answer is given to us by the
[57:21] word
[57:22] let's go to the Book of Psalms
[57:29] we'll be reading the first two verses
[57:32] amen amen
[57:37] this answers to us many of us that have
[57:40] a question that question
[57:42] say don't worry about the unrighteous
[57:45] here's your answer this is
[57:48] the word of the Lord says like this
[57:51] verse chapter 37 in the Book of Psalms
[58:02] spread not thyself because of evildoers
[58:04] neither be thou envious against the
[58:06] workers of iniquity
[58:14] well they shall soon be cut down like
[58:16] the grass and wither as the green herb
[58:19] okay what does this mean this is
[58:27] it causes contention
[58:30] and also more so amongst the the
[58:33] believing people look Brothers to make
[58:37] it more simple uh
[58:40] the prophet speaks on the message of
[58:42] leadership
[58:44] he speaks of the original ruler is
[58:50] characteristics his characteristics
[58:57] you can find it on your time
[59:01] Luke Chapter 16. I.E
[59:06] there what catches my attention is this
[59:08] young man
[59:09] and he approaches the Lord
[59:17] and he asks a question that many ask
[59:20] themselves
[59:23] how many have we heard the the phrase
[59:26] the bad people that they receive good
[59:28] things
[59:30] I don't know if you've heard that why
[59:32] why does that happen is that
[1:00:06] if you want eternal life
[1:00:09] he says well you know the Commandments
[1:00:23] he speaks of The Commandments and he
[1:00:27] says uh teacher her master
[1:00:29] I have done all that since my youth
[1:00:33] is
[1:00:34] and the scripture says that Jesus is
[1:00:37] looking upon Him loved him that's
[1:00:39] tremendous I've
[1:00:49] fulfilled this to the letter
[1:00:51] what else do I lack the Lord says watch
[1:00:56] what he says
[1:00:57] if you want to be perfect all right
[1:01:00] perfect
[1:01:13] because in the following verse
[1:01:16] the Lord the Lord exposes
[1:01:22] that he was a tremendous man
[1:01:25] in this following verse it was a rich
[1:01:28] man
[1:01:30] well still all that you have
[1:01:35] and then when you sell it
[1:01:37] you give to the poor in other words
[1:01:41] deny yourself
[1:01:43] take up your cross man you see
[1:01:47] everything you have give to the poor
[1:01:50] then
[1:01:52] come and take up your cross and follow
[1:01:54] me
[1:01:59] the prophet says
[1:02:04] he was a young man with privilege and he
[1:02:06] had great status
[1:02:08] a man with a good reputation
[1:02:11] man that was taught and learned in the
[1:02:13] scripture in other words
[1:02:16] it was he was a very well
[1:02:20] he was without without blemish
[1:02:26] he went to church
[1:02:33] tremendous amongst the people
[1:02:35] the people were behind you an example to
[1:02:39] follow and he comes to Jesus
[1:02:45] what else do I need
[1:02:47] well if you want to be perfect you have
[1:02:50] to do this
[1:02:51] he understood
[1:02:55] but that was not for him
[1:02:57] how many people we would have thought
[1:03:00] if we knew them
[1:03:02] look at this tremendous man he's so
[1:03:05] successful
[1:03:09] what a great reputation yeah wow
[1:03:41] he was foolish
[1:03:53] he had a lot of inheritance and he had
[1:03:56] become very rich
[1:03:58] he taught within himself
[1:04:04] what shall I do with all this where

[1:08:36] he found himself in in the depths of
[1:08:40] hell
[1:08:41] tribulation
[1:08:48] and he looked up

[1:12:25] Hermanos

[1:12:30] the word of the Lord says like this
[1:12:37] and the seventh angel poured out his
[1:12:40] vial into the air is
[1:12:45] and there came a great voice out of the
[1:12:47] Temple of Heaven from the throne saying
[1:12:49] it is done
[1:12:52] it was the thunder and lightning
[1:12:56] Grande and a great uh earthquake
[1:13:01] Hamas which had never been before
[1:13:05] this man has been has been upon the

[1:13:28] to her cup
[1:13:31] from the wine of fierceness of his wrath
[1:13:35] and every everything every nation fled
[1:13:38] and the mountains were no longer found
[1:13:41] look Brothers

[1:13:58] seven trumpets
[1:14:08] don't get scared here

[1:14:33] foreign
[1:16:30] I understand
[1:16:33] is

[1:18:54] watch what the scripture says
[1:18:56] not in the days of the 17th
[1:19:00] of the voice The Voice
[1:19:06] the ministers
[1:19:33] when a person goes to the Waters of
[1:19:35] baptism did you know
[1:19:41] when the person receives the baptism in
[1:19:43] water
[1:19:52] a sufficient savior
[1:19:56] and to surrender Lord and Lord
[1:20:01] it's as if you're getting married

[1:21:10] of the Bride you are saved estamos we
[1:21:15] are fighting to be a part of the Bride
[1:21:18] that's what the angel said he said come
[1:21:21] higher
[1:21:23] in other words
[1:21:29] go higher than what the denomination is
