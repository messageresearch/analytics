[14:56] I will deliver thee and thou shalt
[14:58] glorify me invoker and the other
[15:00] language tell us you may be seated
[15:05] brothers when we speak of deliverance
[15:13] brothers Lamas Oliver ASEAN we've had a
[15:16] few uh few of services on deliverance so
[15:19] far hemos tenido of REO services a
[15:22] liberation but when we speak on
[15:24] deliverance Liberace own I believe that
[15:28] that the opposite of deliverance is
[15:31] bondage way so deliver ASEAN as surveyed
[15:34] hombre and so brothers you have to be
[15:37] delivered of something concertina
[15:39] Caselli Verado de algo you see you have
[15:41] to be you have to be in bondage to
[15:43] something so then I can set ask la voix
[15:46] before you keep it be delivered of
[15:48] something so we have to ask ourself does
[15:52] anonymous care I won't this question a
[15:55] separate one time you know what what

[16:18] yendo you know what what's the burden
[16:20] that I have koalas like a rocket
[16:23] that's not allowing me enormous talent
[16:26] handle to serve God the way I should
[16:30] because you know because when you have a
[16:33] bondage hosted the SS clavo you know it
[16:37] becomes a burden self well they know not
[16:40] cottage yeah it just it becomes very
[16:42] heavy he said well that boy pasado and

[16:46] scripture
[16:47] Masaki escritura we see here are how
[16:50] they depth that got how in an exodus to
[16:53] chapter of exodus to verse 23
[16:56] next so those are super low and on it
[17:00] talks about how God had heard the cry of
[17:02] the people yes you get agenda that
[17:04] commodious escucha el camino that's who
[17:07] can tell you know I I believe I believe
[17:09] God hears our cry you're okay Oh scooch

[17:14] God listens for ko ko ko says gucchy you
[17:17] know we we have children 710 m OC horse
[17:20] and we know we know their cry si mas can
[17:23] come on your on you know because we I
[17:26] you know I believe children have three
[17:28] types of calls okay yo que los años

[17:32] types of crying out or trans people's
[17:36] deposit money as a your are you know
[17:38] when when your children cries Janos
[17:42] cuando su Nino but with when he cries

[32:12] believe and I believe that that's what
[32:13] was happening here your crocodile okay
[32:15] stop Assad hockey he didn't look at the
[32:17] people of Israel I mean all I hinted is
[32:20] right he didn't look at their condition
[32:22] Gnomeo souk on this yawn you see but he
[32:24] he did he didn't believe he didn't
[32:26] believe they don't know clay your but
[32:29] they were any any more superior yeah
[32:31] yeah I'll get my superhero they were
[32:33] more superior than the people of Egypt
[32:35] my superior que la gente de egipto you
[32:38] see but he remembered to answer a call
[32:40] or his covenant sabato with Abraham
[32:43] enough ROM you see and that's what moved
[32:46] him
[32:46] yes local above you I and that's what
[32:48] moved him as look a lot more vile to
[32:51] pursue start to prepare a proper arson
[32:54] to start to prepare a delivery after I
[32:56] do not even ask for the people of Israel
[32:59] because of the Covenant that he made put
[33:03] in part ok with Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[33:07] I believe there's a story here yo creo
[33:11] que hay una storia I like to read
[33:13] illustration I'm cyclist they just make
[33:18] me understand things a little bit better
[33:19] I saw some polka my hardest raishin says
[33:25] this yes see since there was a little
[33:28] Scottish lady
[33:29] avianna Senora ESCO says you worked hard
[33:33] taking in washing in order to send her
[33:35] son to the University a trabajar dude Oh
[33:38] LaVon doe para maana rasoi hoe when he
[33:43] came home for vacation Cascione
[33:46] his mind was filled with doubt about God
[33:49] Montessori anacondas sovereign doors
[33:51] from the liberal teaching he had
[33:53] received the UNA and science Oliver
[33:55] arcavir Acevedo you see brothers I'm
[33:59] gonna hold on right there
[34:02] you know because we just begin to doubt
[34:05] so many things well yeah Samos a lot on
[34:08] Tascosa
[34:08] you know if we read our scriptures we
[34:12] see the promises of God as promised I
[34:15] said and I never see one Yo no quiero
[34:17] una that has a question mark behind it
[34:20] caddy so knock on market there's not a
[34:27] single there's not a single promise of
[34:30] God no I mean guna promesa of yours that
[34:32] has a question mark behind the mark in
[34:37] the period a shipwreck or non Punto you
[34:41] see we're the ones that put the question
[34:42] mark behind it so so so unless kept on a
[34:44] muslin signal and it shouldn't be so
[34:49] because if God put a period behind was
[34:52] so important phenom then I believe that
[34:55] that's what he meant
[34:56] Yoko caste was okay thank you saw that
[34:58] seed I believe he said by His stripes
[35:00] you were healed
