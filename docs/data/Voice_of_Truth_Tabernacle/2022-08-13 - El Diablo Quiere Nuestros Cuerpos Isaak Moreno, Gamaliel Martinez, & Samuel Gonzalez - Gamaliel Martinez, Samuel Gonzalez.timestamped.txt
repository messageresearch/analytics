[27:22] [Applause]
[27:27] hey man let's give a hand applause to
[27:28] our lord jesus christ
[27:32] amen
[27:35] amen i'm so glad to be here tonight
[27:42] um let's open our scriptures
[27:46] to jude 1
[27:47] and hold us
[27:51] verse nine capitol nueve
[27:54] pardon
[27:58] chapter one
[28:02] man it's
[28:03] it's been a while since i've been up
[28:04] here yeah i'm nervous
[28:09] it's a little different than song
[28:11] leading and worshiping
[28:17] [Music]
[28:28] amen let's read the scripture
[28:31] it says yet michael the archangel when
[28:34] contending with the devil he disputed
[28:36] about the body of moses durst not bring
[28:39] against him a rallying accusation but
[28:41] said the lord rebuked
[28:56] if we could just go to one more um
[28:58] scripture in the bible matthew 8.
[29:03] verse 22.
[29:10] and it says like this i see but jesus
[29:13] said unto him follow me and let the dead
[29:16] bury their dead jesus
[29:21] hey man let's bow our heads in prayers
[30:05] amen amen you may be seated
[30:09] amen so as we see in this verse of jude
[30:11] 1.
[30:16] we see that michael the archangel
[30:19] miguel was contending
[30:41] and we see we wonder why was the devil
[30:43] fighting for moses moses body if he was
[30:45] already dead
[31:02] so we see that the devil's bringing
[31:04] accusations
[31:08] against moses
[31:10] and a lot of the times
[31:12] the devil wants to bring accusations
[31:14] against our youth amen
[31:30] but then we see
[31:44] us
[31:46] we make our mistakes amen
[31:50] amen amen i want to read another verse
[31:52] in ephesians 2.
[31:56] and it says like
[31:57] verse 2 verse 1 i mean chapter two verse
[32:00] one my bad capitola
[32:02] uno and it says and you hath he
[32:05] quickened who were dead and trespasses
[32:08] and sins
[32:14] and if we jump to verse five it says
[32:18] even when we were dead in sin
[32:20] estando nosotros muertos en pecados hath
[32:23] quickened us together with christ
[32:31] amen we see that you know the devil is
[32:33] going to bring our past to us
[32:37] he's going to want us bring us down
[32:40] he's going
[33:04] you know there's so many things that we
[33:06] could keep going about
[33:20] just some
[33:22] some um
[33:24] some synonyms
[33:27] for um
[33:29] for the word quicken
[33:33] sorry brother
[33:34] all right uh just some synonyms
[33:38] to stimulate yes
[33:43] to stir up
[33:45] to arouse
[33:47] to awaken
[33:49] amen so god wants to excite us about the
[33:52] things
[33:54] god wants to use us
[33:56] he doesn't want the devil to use us
[34:00] a lot of times we let the devil easily
[34:02] use us
[34:06] and i believe
[34:07] i believe yo
[34:09] the reasons why we let the devil use us
[34:13] it's because we don't study the word
[34:16] we don't study this message
[34:45] because we think oh i don't know
[34:47] sometimes we think the devil has more
[34:49] power than what we have amen
[34:54] i just want to read a quote
[34:57] in 1957
[35:42] my
[35:52] no when i first started
[35:54] started playing soccer when you come and
[35:56] start
[36:00] i remember i i think i missed a couple
[36:02] of practices
[36:06] and when i first played my freshman year
[36:08] i think i missed a game because of
[36:10] church
[36:22] just have something to do with my family
[36:26] and they kept going they're like oh
[36:28] what's your what are you doing with your
[36:30] family
[36:33] and i'm like oh we just have some stuff
[36:34] planned out you know yeah
[36:52] and god shouldn't be private if he's in
[36:54] our life say man
[36:56] god should be something
[36:58] that when people see you walk down the
[37:00] street
[37:02] that's a christian amen
[37:04] when they hear you talk
[37:48] one more time god's not going to use you
[37:50] yeah
[37:51] and probably the devil's fine not even
[37:53] going to use you yeah
[37:54] diablo so you're just going to be dead
[37:58] and it says such as that that's right
[38:00] you're not much good for anything dude
[38:28] i just wanted to read this um as we know
[38:31] moses
[38:33] i believe moses was not a coward
[38:37] as we know he went to pharaoh many times
[38:41] to ask to ask to let the people go amen
[39:14] and um
[39:17] in exodus 10 24 10 chapter 10 verse 24
[39:20] and exo he has venti cuatro
[39:24] and it says lisa and pharaoh called unto
[39:26] moses and said go ye serve the lord only
[39:29] let your flocks and your herds be stayed
[39:31] let your little ones also go with you
[39:34] anton says
[39:42] and moses said thou must give us also
[39:45] sacrifices and bear offerings
[39:48] that we may sacrifice unto the lord our
[39:50] god
[39:53] sacrifice
[39:58] our cattle also shall go with us there
[40:00] shall not and hoof be left behind for
[40:02] therefore must we take
[40:04] to serve the lord our god and we know
[40:07] not with what we must serve the lord
[40:09] until we come.
[40:09] [Music]
[40:19] hey man we see moses here
[40:22] we see him
[40:39] he tells us we're not going to have to
[40:40] make a sacrifice
[40:43] he's like just leave your flocks here
[40:46] leave your flocks here when you go back
[40:47] home
[40:50] leave your flocks
[41:01] we're too ashamed to come to the altar a
[41:02] lot of the times
[41:19] and it's it and he says
[41:21] moses said
[41:22] thou must give us also sacrifices and
[41:25] bear offerings amen
[41:29] see god doesn't want you the way you are
[41:31] veg
[42:10] and you see a lot of the times even
[42:12] muchas versus how i was reading how
[42:15] sometimes we're cowards
[42:18] and the devil uses us
[42:22] because we're too ashamed to serve god
[42:24] amen
[42:26] show our gifts
[42:42] i
[42:56] i don't believe
[43:10] yeah
[43:11] alex
[43:12] and he says it is a you have a you have
[43:15] choices
[43:17] god will not make all of our choices
[43:21] if we want to be in church
[43:23] it's because it's our choice but god
[43:26] doesn't want you unhappy here in church
[43:28] if you want to if you want to go smoke
[43:31] you want to go drink
[43:33] it you want to go parties
[43:35] you want to go cuss whatever you want to
[43:37] do
[43:54] [Applause]
[44:06] what a very good job my brother isaac
[44:08] did
[44:13] it
[44:16] in which we placed in this episode
[44:19] it's because it's the closing
[44:22] characteristic
[44:23] of the character moses
[44:28] so the subject or
[44:30] interest in me
[44:35] because we're going to re-read
[44:37] jude chapter one verse nine once again
[44:39] brothers
[44:53] yet michael the archangel when
[44:55] contending with the devil he disputed
[44:58] about the body of moses
[45:00] durst not bringing bringing against him
[45:02] and reeling accusation but said the lord
[45:05] rebuked thee
[45:07] look brothers we see here
[45:09] uh
[45:15] you can ask or start to question
[45:16] yourself
[45:30] why did the devil want the body of moses
[45:34] [Applause]
[45:39] it's not 100 certain but historians from
[45:41] back then
[45:44] i like what the historians said
[45:46] they said
[45:49] the devil wanted the body of moses
[45:51] for one simple reason
[45:54] because he wanted to raise them up
[45:58] because he knew
[46:00] barrios that several
[46:02] barrios
[46:06] with a false spirit man right
[46:09] that's what the historian said
[47:01] [Music]
[47:21] so why the title the devil wants your
[47:24] body youth
[47:26] el diablo the devil
[47:29] wants this body for those motivos
[47:36] and so you
[48:03] 100 sure god's going to use
[48:32] is
[48:46] of the lord died
[48:48] in the land of moab
[48:51] according to the word of the lord
[48:56] and he buried him in a valley in in a
[48:59] valley in the land of moa over against
[50:32] the devil claims or fought for the body
[50:33] of moses for two arguments
[50:47] [Applause]
[51:48] tries
[51:51] tries to keep your bodies
[52:01] in first corinthians chapter 6 verse 19
[52:04] it says
[52:16] what no ye not that your body is the
[52:18] temple of the of the holy ghost which is
[52:20] in you which ye have of god and you are
[52:23] not of your of your peace
[52:27] this body is not about
[52:29] that's the reason
[52:32] why the lord jesus christ
[52:34] takes care of us what protects us
[52:44] for ye are bought with a price therefore
[52:47] glorifying god in your body and in your
[52:49] spirit which are gods los cuales
[52:52] which are gods figures
[52:58] which are gods
[53:11] because he knows that we will fail
[53:54] in 1955 1005.
[53:58] i can connect it this way
[54:05] do not ignore that your body is the
[54:07] temple of the lord jesus christ
[54:36] the believer with the holy ghost
[54:43] until they're so soaked full they're not
[54:45] they're they're not full of themselves
[54:47] anymore
[54:49] they're not full of themselves anymore
[54:56] then she can blunt the waves bump
[54:58] against the logs and knock them out of
[55:00] the way
[55:02] but keep going on hallelujah
[55:34] do not ignore that your part is the
[55:36] temple of the lord jesus christ
[55:38] i'm going to put it in this way
[56:13] oh
[56:42] semester like a brother isaac
[56:54] be soaked with that
[57:23] it doesn't matter if that pitch breaks a
[57:24] couple times
[57:35] saying you got the position you
[57:37] understand
[58:00] that's right
[58:20] puts things in
[58:29] what do you want to withhold in your
[58:31] body
[58:32] that
[58:33] right
[59:00] those many of those that did not want to
[59:02] pay attention to the advice of bosses
[59:05] he was with them
[59:08] they would have been in danger of
[59:09] committing adultery
[59:11] idolatry
[59:12] with their dead body
[59:15] the the statue of the ox
[59:20] if i if he had known where he was buried
[59:26] uh
[59:28] if the the body of moses had been gay
[59:30] by
[1:00:12] the waves
[1:00:54] we
[1:01:20] he has to cast out all things
[1:01:23] all things idolatry enojo anger
[1:01:27] depression depression
[1:01:30] whatever you want
[1:01:35] to cast all that out
[1:02:03] youth
[1:02:05] [Applause]
[1:02:12] god bless you
[1:02:15] our god noise
[1:02:16] fulfills his promises
[1:02:31] amen
[1:02:32] if you could please open your bibles to
[1:02:33] deuteronomy 34 verse 4.
[1:02:42] and it says like this dc and the lord
[1:02:45] said unto him
[1:02:50] this is the land which i swear unto
[1:02:52] abraham unto isaac and unto jacob
[1:03:08] i have caused thee to see you with thine
[1:03:10] eyes but thou shalt not go over it
[1:03:16] 5 so moses the servant of the lord died
[1:03:18] there in the land of moab according to
[1:03:20] the word of the lord
[1:03:27] verse 6 and he buried him in a valley in
[1:03:30] the land of moab over against beth
[1:03:38] but no man knoweth of his simple tree
[1:03:40] unto this day
[1:03:42] logarithm
[1:03:55] i want all the youth to understand
[1:04:38] where he reaches the top of mount pisgah
[1:04:44] and god shows him the front of jericho
[1:04:49] and he shows him all the promised lands
[1:05:34] you will not be
[1:06:16] his
[1:06:29] because there was no reason for moses to
[1:06:30] strike that wrong okay
[1:06:34] god knows what he is doing
[1:06:37] you see it god wanted to take him to
[1:06:39] another level
[1:06:41] but because of letting himself get
[1:06:43] carried away pero porque
[1:07:00] and
[1:07:01] to this day nobody knows where the grave
[1:07:03] of moses is
[1:07:06] but i want to express something
[1:07:08] before giving details of moses
[1:07:13] we know that moses was one of the
[1:07:14] greatest leaders
[1:07:17] and i believe that moses
[1:07:20] was one of the greatest men shown in the
[1:07:21] bible
[1:07:24] you see moses
[1:07:26] left the great legacy the whole grand
[1:07:28] legato and we all know it also
[1:07:31] that moses did die
[1:07:33] but he did not die a coward
[1:07:36] he did not die leaving it like a sad
[1:07:38] story
[1:07:40] no because
[1:07:55] this they say and moses calls unto
[1:07:57] joshua
[1:07:59] and said unto him
[1:08:01] in the sight of all israel israel be
[1:08:03] strong and of good courage
[1:08:06] thou must go with these people into the
[1:08:08] land
[1:08:11] which the lord has sworn unto their
[1:08:13] fathers
[1:08:17] and thou shalt cause them to inherit
[1:08:21] and the lord he it is that doth
[1:08:35] you see the new testament in jude
[1:08:39] it shows us that after moses died
[1:08:43] of moses
[1:08:47] because the angel of the lord
[1:08:49] disputed
[1:09:04] 1957.
[1:09:07] moses was never absent
[1:09:10] no his body was packed away
[1:09:13] the angels took him los angeles
[1:09:15] he did not mortified
[1:09:18] he did not corrupt
[1:09:43] you see moses was a good leader family
[1:09:45] says
[1:09:46] the
[1:10:24] with the simplicity of just looking at
[1:10:26] his body simplicidade solo versus
[1:10:33] it looks like the life of moses is sad
[1:10:34] in the end
[1:10:38] it's like for an example for example
[1:10:40] it's like my father telling me
[1:11:09] you see when there was the great
[1:11:10] transfiguration in matthew 17.
[1:11:15] moses appeared in the great
[1:11:16] transfiguration
[1:11:20] i want to explain something
[1:11:22] and i want you all to listen carefully
[1:11:25] you see why did moses appear in the
[1:11:28] great transfiguration
[1:11:33] is that moses
[1:11:35] always pointed towards jesus
[1:11:38] whatever
[1:11:51] the bible says that he was the type of
[1:11:53] christ
[1:11:55] he would always point out to jesus
[1:12:05] who will be greater than
[1:12:18] was the one that he spoke of
[1:13:05] now we are speaking in the time of jesus
[1:13:09] and the jewish people there in that time
[1:13:12] we're with the law of moses
[1:13:15] so now moses needs to return
[1:13:19] and prove to the jewish people
[1:13:26] not to say this is parallel
[1:13:28] i could say this is
[1:14:13] one there was the ditch
[1:14:15] you see number two
[1:14:17] the wife of part of the las posada
[1:14:20] trapping
[1:14:24] brothers
[1:16:05] amen amen you see god fulfills his
[1:16:08] promises
[1:16:10] you see everything in the bible
[1:16:13] is parallel
[1:16:15] with the purpose in the end
[1:16:18] you see the
[1:16:42] is
[1:18:24] my
[1:19:19] but god knows more and what god
[1:19:24] brings to us
[1:19:28] you see romans 12 2 romano's
[1:19:31] and be not confirmed to this world nos
[1:19:34] conforma
[1:19:36] [Music]
