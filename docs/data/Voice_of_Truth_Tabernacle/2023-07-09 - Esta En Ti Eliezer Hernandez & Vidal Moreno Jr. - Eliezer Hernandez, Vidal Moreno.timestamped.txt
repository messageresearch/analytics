[24:33] forced him
[24:39] that is something great
[24:43] for that sacrifice
[24:46] we are all here standing
[24:49] all here giving him glory
[24:52] I mean he deserves it
[24:55] this morning
[24:58] we give thanks to God for the
[25:00] opportunity
[25:06] we'll be reading two scriptures
[25:11] first one is in John 4.
[25:15] and verse 13 and 14.
[25:20] John 14 13 and 14. it is
[25:27] first of John 4
[25:30] from verse 4 to verse 7.
[25:34] we also take advantage for the
[25:36] opportunity
[25:38] agreed everyone watching live in the
[25:41] internet
[25:43] and we also agreed everyone visiting
[25:50] it may be a blessing for you to be here
[26:04] Jesus answered said unto her whosoever
[26:07] drinking of this water shall thirst
[26:09] again
[26:21] but whosoever drinketh of the water that
[26:24] I shall give him shall never thirst but
[26:26] the water that I shall give him shall be
[26:28] in him a well of water springing up into
[26:30] everlasting life
[26:35] now first of John
[26:37] chapter 4 verse 4.
[26:40] when you have you can say Amen
[26:48] first John 4 4 reads
[26:54] benzido
[26:58] ye are of God little children and have
[27:01] overcame them now notice this
[27:06] because greater is he that is in you
[27:09] I'm gonna read it again
[27:14] because greater is he that is in you
[27:18] then he that is in the world
[27:26] therefore speak they of the world and
[27:29] the world heareth them Nosotros
[27:32] we are of God
[27:34] adios
[27:40] he that is not of God not us
[27:47] hereby know we the spirit of truth and
[27:51] the spirit of error amados beloved
[27:54] let us love one another foreign
[28:21] [Music]
[28:27] [Music]
[28:56] brother
[29:11] so God's word tells us
[29:15] the greater is he that is in US aura
[29:19] now is
[29:21] obviously God's word says
[29:24] he wants to be inside us
[29:28] he wants to be inside us
[29:33] now we're still under the subject the
[29:36] coming of the Lord
[29:39] our pastor has been focusing on the
[29:41] Rapture
[29:45] asosie
[29:47] that's our thought always keep that in
[29:49] mind
[29:51] now the Rapture we're speaking of noise
[30:01] Rapture is only for the bride
[30:06] yes
[30:10] so if the bride is waiting for a Rapture
[30:16] the bride should be preparing for this
[30:18] Rapture this is
[30:23] if we were not waiting foreign
[31:04] but the holy spirit is uniting every
[31:07] piece
[31:09] you cannot untie things
[31:13] and think that everything is happening
[31:16] just because
[31:17] for coincidence
[31:20] no God is speaking to us in a certain
[31:23] way
[31:24] and many of us
[31:28] that's why God has different gifts
[31:32] God gave certain abilities
[31:36] form them in a certain way
[31:41] so if they don't understand someone in
[31:44] one way foreign
[32:31] and that's okay to come to church
[32:34] and he also says it's also not okay
[32:38] because you don't come how you should
[32:40] because
[32:42] many come to church and don't take
[32:45] anything
[32:47] what was the point in that
[32:50] what's the point in a rapture
[33:00] [Music]
[33:12] many think because they don't believe in
[33:15] a Rapture it's not going to happen
[33:21] many think because they don't believe in
[33:23] a prophet there isn't one
[33:29] Bueno
[33:31] pero
[33:33] is
[33:35] the first grain exactly and the message
[33:39] leadership
[33:49] to return life this is
[33:54] in paragraph 136 a message leadership it
[33:57] reads
[34:02] the first corn of wheat the bridegroomed
[34:07] hard to fall into the Earth in order to
[34:09] rise again
[34:13] so did the first part I was born at
[34:16] Pentecost
[34:20] how to go through that Dark Ages like
[34:22] any other seeds
[34:31] but it started sprouting
[34:52] move continuously with God
[34:58] if we stay dwarfs
[35:01] something is wrong
[35:04] something wasn't done well amen amen
[35:08] this is
[35:17] but it was the light of that day the
[35:20] stock then went on on into a tassel
[35:23] Wesley is
[35:26] and from the tassel it went into
[35:28] Pentecost the shook
[35:32] when you see into the wheat when it
[35:34] comes foreign
[35:55] but if you take a tweezer and sit down
[35:58] and take that weed and open it up
[36:00] there's no grain there at all
[36:03] it's just a shock and then what is it's
[36:09] formed there
[36:10] to hold the grains
[36:13] and then the first thing you know
[36:18] the life left the stock to go into the
[36:21] tassel
[36:23] go into the ship
[36:27] and goes into the wheat
[36:29] three stages
[36:35] and then forms a weed outside of three
[36:38] stages
[36:44] you can interrupt nature
[36:48] they cannot interrupt nature brother
[36:52] advance
[37:27] it's hard to be the bride
[37:31] pero sisters
[37:38] but if you settle with being the one
[37:41] that hands a glass of water to the bride
[37:44] you are risking too much
[37:56] you have to go to the highest price
[38:03] we have one foot in the water
[38:06] why not it's so emergency
[38:11] and this Fountain of Life
[38:16] you can't have nature
[38:19] forgive me we can't stop now
[38:22] as much as you want to stop nature
[38:25] I'm going to stay in this place
[38:28] I'm gonna stay here nothing's and No
[38:30] One's Gonna Move Me
[38:38] if you put yourself aside hey
[38:42] instead that's you
[38:44] but if you hold on to them
[38:51] brother says
[38:59] the live shoot the stock back there here
[39:02] carries the life certainly it did
[39:08] become the stock and it was finished the
[39:11] organization the life run right on into
[39:14] Wesley because
[39:22] cuarento uh
[39:29] won a big blade does not look like the
[39:32] grains
[39:37] but when the little pollen comes like on
[39:40] the shook or on the stock the pollen of
[39:42] the tassel it looks like a whole lot of
[39:44] like the grains
[39:47] but when it comes down to that shook
[39:49] it's almost there
[39:52] didn't Jesus say in the last days
[39:59] so close it would deceive the very jeans
[40:03] the elect once if it was possible
[40:07] almost like the real thing
[40:11] when you want to stay in just one place
[40:13] Brethren but I mean for me personally
[40:18] it's like if you want to force something
[40:20] that isn't
[40:34] you're forcing something that isn't
[40:38] as he said
[41:15] there are many things that are in US
[41:18] president
[41:20] did you know your healing is in you
[41:27] did you know that the body heals itself
[41:31] because it's in itself already
[41:36] generation that process is called
[41:38] regeneration
[41:41] there are cells that regeneration
[41:44] if you cut yourself
[41:48] something forms where the skin begins to
[41:51] close again and regenerates
[42:15] [Music]
[42:19] he's gonna give it to us in a natural
[42:22] way
[42:24] so we can understand it in a spiritual
[42:27] way
[42:28] and forgive me if you're falling asleep
[42:35] one day my father was driving with a
[42:38] brother
[42:40] or my father was a passenger and a
[42:42] brother was driving
[42:44] and the brother was falling asleep
[42:49] and this brother told my father that was
[42:51] in the passengers he's falling asleep he
[42:54] says
[43:04] what just happened
[43:06] contender
[43:37] and you people here Harvest apples I
[43:39] have understood

[43:52] an inch
[43:54] tallness
[43:58] every Apple that tree is gonna give it
[44:01] is in that tree already
[44:04] the life is already in there

[44:11] inside of it
[44:19] did you know all those 100 pounds of
[44:21] leaves that will fall are in it at that
[44:23] moment
[44:25] every flower is there in that moment
[44:29] every limb is in it at that moment
[44:33] if it is
[44:37] they came from in donde esta where is it
[44:40] where do they come from
[44:42] what do you do
[44:45] you take the seed and sow it

[45:08] limbs it'll push
[45:11] out apples it's in it yesterday it's
[45:16] already in it
[45:17] but it has to keep drinking
[45:22] and every word of God and every word of
[45:25] God is a seed is
[45:31] and if that seed can be planted by then
[45:33] exhausted

[47:22] that big down there in that great
[47:24] Gardeners of Egypt saying
[47:31] I just better eat two grains a day
[47:33] because I might run out before summer

[47:51] and they had billions times billions of
[47:53] tons of them fish they'd never drink
[47:55] that water multiplication

[49:15] uh it's good to be in the house of the
[49:17] Lord
[49:19] this is a special day today
[49:22] a special day yesterday
[49:26] was my birthday
[49:29] and uh today is uh our anniversary
[49:32] reminding my wives
[49:36] it's a it's a very special
[49:40] uh you know she she's been with me uh
[49:43] when I when I had nothing he has to work
[49:46] on me when I felt like nothing yeah
[49:51] and uh you know uh
[49:54] um
[49:54] honestly
[49:57] um it just it just keeps getting better
[50:00] because after I met her
[50:03] she took me uh to uh my uh true love
[50:09] yes the Lord Jesus Christ
[50:12] you know she was the instrument God used
[50:15] to to bring me to uh to Christ
[50:23] God used her yeah and uh you know it's
[50:26] that's special to me I felt like I had
[50:29] no purpose
[50:32] but uh you know she believed in me
[50:35] when I didn't believe in myself
[50:38] and I'm thankful to the Lord
[50:41] you know for uh for being able to to
[50:44] have her por podert
[50:46] so God bless her
[50:48] and let us just open our our Bibles
[50:53] to the Book of Genesis
[51:11] it is like this this I see
[51:15] and Enoch lived 60 and five years and
[51:18] began Methuselah if you're an ox Center
[51:20] is
[51:23] not walked with God after he began
[51:26] Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and
[51:28] daughters
[51:34] and all the days of Enoch were 360 in
[51:37] five years
[51:40] and Enoch walked with God
[52:24] amen amen uh you know uh a few weeks
[52:28] back as soon as I was just kind of
[52:31] contemplating
[52:32] I was just you know I couldn't go to
[52:34] sleep
[52:36] it was a Sunday around Domingo good
[52:39] morning Domingo and it's one thing I can
[52:43] identify with a foreign
[53:10] [Music]
[53:23] so I started looking on the
[53:26] calendario and uh you know I was born on
[53:29] a Sunday
[53:31] and I I started I called my mom
[53:34] I asked my mom
[53:36] so Mom do you remember when when I was
[53:39] born
[53:40] you know my mom she she always said I'd
[53:43] be a preacher
[53:56] and uh
[54:06] because you know that's when you were
[54:09] born
[54:10] so you know I just kind of took that for
[54:12] myself Anton says
[54:14] you know that doesn't mean everybody has
[54:16] to go do that
[54:19] but uh I just took it for myself
[54:22] I took it personally
[54:24] that I was born for service
[54:28] I was born for the service of the Lord
[54:30] that's what I was called here to do what
[54:33] I saw foreign
[55:35] when I see that uh you know when you see
[55:38] your name in the Bible
[55:40] that's that's special yeah that's extra
[55:43] special
[55:44] you would have a name like David
[55:47] be able to have a name like Titus
[55:51] Jacob you know even to be you know just
[55:55] be among the angels
[55:58] list you know it's it's special it's a
[56:00] special because you know I believe that
[56:02] in all throughout all the Davis there is
[56:08] you should be able to identify what's
[56:10] that except
[56:12] you know if there's a Jacob in the Bible
[56:14] you should be able to say man God's
[56:16] talking to me
[56:18] to be able to have the name of Isaac
[56:22] it's just it's just something special
[56:25] you know you're you God thought about
[56:27] you
[56:28] he wasn't just talking about the the
[56:30] Jacob in in or the Isaac in the Bible
[56:33] but if he was talking about all the Isis
[56:40] themselves in God's word
[56:42] amen amen I believe that with all my
[56:45] heart
[56:46] you know but I believe in
[56:49] in the Bible what type of the Bride
[56:52] I believe he not had something special
[56:56] uh you know because when
[57:13] he says this he says
[57:18] in the message a lord show us and Lord
[57:21] show us the father and it suffice to us
[57:26] he says
[57:28] he says and that's the way a Christian
[57:31] is
[57:33] we are planted together in Christ Jesus
[57:37] Jesus who is the inexhaustible Fountain
[57:40] of Life
[57:42] since we are planted in Christ
[57:45] and we just drink
[57:47] and drinks
[57:50] and we push out
[57:52] and everything we have need of for the
[57:55] Earthly Journey
[57:58] Divine Healing the power of God and all
[58:03] these other things
[58:04] is in every individual in here
[58:09] that's received the baptism of the Holy
[58:12] Ghost
[58:13] this is for you are planted in Christ
[58:18] hallelujah hallelujah it says the Holy
[58:21] Ghost baptism
[58:24] and everything you have needed for this
[58:26] life
[58:27] for this life's journey
[58:30] even the Rapture is
[58:34] this Anton says it says don't resent
[58:37] that no serious oh that's the truth the
[58:42] Rapture is in us
[58:44] it's in you right now
[58:47] amen amen if you can accept that
[58:52] then then it's for you
[58:54] amen amen but we have to accept it
[59:01] there has to be authors
[59:04] for God's things
[59:06] you know in order for us
[59:09] to be able to to desire it is to be able
[59:14] to walk
[59:15] with God you know because the Bible says
[59:19] Enoch walked with God okay I realize
[59:24] he had a revelation
[59:26] you see faith is a revelation
[59:29] and Rapture the Rapture is also a
[59:33] revelation
[59:41] he was not walking in the blind
[59:44] the image was revealed to him foreign
[1:00:06] body can live
[1:00:08] you know anybody can live dollar sport
[1:00:11] mbv no but that doesn't mean you're
