[20:42] tonight it is a a meaningful day for
[20:48] us it is a good
[20:53] Friday it's the day our lord Jesus was
[20:57] bruised
[21:00] when he was
[21:02] marred for
[21:05] us so we could have
[21:09] life want to send a greeting to everyone
[21:12] watching through the
[21:16] internet and everybody here in the
[21:18] audience God bless
[21:22] you and our title for
[21:26] tonight is love Express
[21:31] if you can turn quickly to Isaiah 536
[21:33] with
[21:39] me when you have it you can say
[21:50] Amen Isaiah
[21:55] 536 and it reads like this
[22:00] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[22:03] have turned everyone to his own way and
[22:06] the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[22:09] of us
[22:22] all God bless his word if you can help
[22:25] me
[22:27] pray
[22:29] heavenly
[22:30] father thank you for this special moment
[22:35] Lord that we receive more of your
[22:38] Revelation
[22:40] father receive more of your
[22:42] unconditional
[22:44] love Lord if anybody here is not
[22:47] understanding what happened this
[22:52] day Lord May at the end of the service
[22:55] you reveal to their
[22:57] hearts
[23:00] and Lord for what you've done for
[23:03] me I can't give you anything
[23:06] else than my own life
[23:10] Lord use it
[23:12] father use the lives of my brothers that
[23:15] you bought
[23:18] Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[23:20] Christ we
[23:22] pray amen amen you may be seated
[23:27] brother
[23:29] just want to uh tell you a little bit
[23:31] about myself before we get into the
[23:33] thick of
[23:38] it our subject is about love in this
[23:45] night but I wanted to originally speak
[23:49] about
[23:52] Judas I wanted to
[23:57] before I was feeling pressed all
[24:02] week
[24:04] and it's the judases of
[24:09] life it's the judices of life that push
[24:12] us to where we need to
[24:20] be anybody understanding what I'm
[24:24] saying Judas pressed the Lord
[24:27] Jesus
[24:35] betrayed and that's how we received the
[24:38] beautiful scent of the uh Rose of Sharon
[24:48] amen that was Jesus
[24:53] Christ I would like to make a
[24:57] comparison
[24:59] but before that because I was going
[25:01] getting pressed in my
[25:08] week the devil wanted to change my focus
[25:11] to Judas on this
[25:18] day on Jesus's
[25:21] day kind of
[25:25] ironic but I began to read the message
[25:32] we appreciate judas's
[25:36] work but we need to speak about Jesus
[25:41] today it's Jesus's day
[25:45] today it's his weekend I'm
[25:49] sorry Jesus's weekend
[25:52] amen although it should be every
[25:56] weekend but today it's more
[25:59] special now instead of preaching about
[26:03] the
[26:07] crucifixion I would like to when I was
[26:11] young nobody really explained to me
[26:15] other I'm sorry go ahead other than
[26:17] Jesus died for my
[26:24] sins and that's all you hear in the
[26:27] denomination
[26:31] but
[26:32] tonight there are many other
[26:38] reasons why the crucifixion had to
[26:41] happen the way it
[26:46] happened and I would like to take you
[26:49] first with Adam and
[26:54] Eve forgive me if I'm very slow I'm
[26:56] sensitive right now
[27:04] to understand what happened in uh
[27:09] Calvary we have to understand what
[27:12] happened in
[27:17] Eden in
[27:19] Eden Eve
[27:23] sinned Eve
[27:26] sin and God
[27:29] had to kill
[27:34] sheep because the law
[27:37] was the day you eat of this
[27:42] tree you shall surely
[27:47] die so Adam and Eve sinning for all of
[27:56] us they sentenced us to
[28:00] death we were disconnected from
[28:06] communion we had no communion with
[28:10] God amen amen and God in his
[28:16] love in God in his
[28:20] love instead of killing Adam and
[28:24] Eve he killed two sheep two Lambs
[28:29] and made them dress with these
[28:35] skins to cover their
[28:39] sin that was God's provided way back
[28:46] then that's
[28:49] right
[28:51] so I have a lot of quotes here and I
[28:53] don't want to just read here I'd rather
[28:57] illustrate
[29:02] brother brandham talks about a man
[29:05] called Blind B
[29:10] mayus and I really did not know this
[29:12] about
[29:16] him but it says that blind Bas was uh on
[29:21] the street and he had a a mug and two
[29:24] Turtle
[29:27] does
[29:31] and it says one day his daughter got
[29:38] sick and he offered those doves as a
[29:41] sacrifice to heal his
[29:47] daughter and then his wife got
[29:53] sick and blind B mayus had a lamb back
[29:57] then
[30:02] they didn't have dogs back then to guide
[30:04] the
[30:09] Blind and his wife got
[30:14] sick
[30:15] and
[30:18] barus walking up the
[30:22] street um I think it was uh the high
[30:25] priest
[30:26] Caiaphas
[30:30] he begins to say where are you
[30:35] going and barame says I'm going to the
[30:40] temple to sacrifice my
[30:44] lamb he says I promis the Lord if he'd
[30:47] heal my
[30:51] wife I would give my
[30:56] lamb and says you can't give that lamp
[30:59] that's your walking
[31:05] lamp buy lamps from the sellers outside
[31:08] of the temple H I'm sorry buy lamps from
[31:12] the
[31:19] sellers and sacrifice that
[31:23] one but Bame
[31:26] said I promis him my
[31:33] lamb he said I promis him this
[31:38] lamb his walking guiding
[31:45] lamb then brother brandham
[31:48] says I wonder if we've made promises
[31:51] like
[31:55] that he says and if you see the all
[31:58] sufficient lamp
[32:04] tonight he says Lord if you'll get me
[32:09] well I will serve
[32:11] you I will do everything I
[32:15] can if you let my baby
[32:18] live if you if you'll let my baby
[32:23] live we make promises like
[32:26] that
[32:29] but let us be like
[32:32] barus I promised him this
[32:37] one then brother brandham says he went
[32:40] up and offered his
[32:45] lamb and they would still tell him you
[32:47] can't do
[32:50] that have any of you sacrific something
[32:53] so
[32:56] big and and they tell you don't do
[32:59] that you can't do
[33:02] it can't let it
[33:10] go Hallelujah he said yes I
[33:16] know but I promis
[33:22] God and God will provide a
[33:26] lamb
[33:29] for blind B's
[33:34] eyes wow Glory you have to put yourself
[33:39] in barda's shoes
[33:44] here Isaac
[33:47] here Alex here Alex we need to sacrifice
[33:53] something but we have to trust in
[33:56] God
[33:58] that God will provide again for
[34:02] us like our pastor was
[34:06] saying we have a cheap
[34:09] mind a poor
[34:13] mind a scarce
[34:16] mind we want to hold on to what we
[34:21] have we cannot think abundantly like our
[34:26] God
[34:33] brother brandham
[34:35] says and I want to read
[34:38] this paragraph 66 in
[34:45] English 66 I'm
[34:49] sorry not long after
[34:53] that after he had sacrificed his
[34:56] lamb
[35:00] God had provided the lamb for blind bed
[35:03] May's
[35:12] eyes he came along the
[35:15] street he said what's all this
[35:21] noise there's usually noise where where
[35:24] he's
[35:26] at
[35:28] is there noise where Jesus
[35:31] is there should be noise in this
[35:36] place noise of
[35:43] Thanksgiving he
[35:45] says what's all this noise he
[35:49] said one Jesus of Nazareth passed
[35:54] by he threw down his coat
[35:58] [Applause]
[36:00] not looking where it
[36:02] went he didn't care
[36:06] then God had provided a
[36:11] lamb he got right to the
[36:16] lamb he said oh
[36:19] Jesus thou son of
[36:24] David hopefully we can look at the
[36:26] sacrifice tonight
[36:30] and say have mercy of
[36:34] me have mercy of
[36:41] me the rich people and those who stood
[36:46] around to get close to the prophet to
[36:49] the king he
[36:53] said Oh Be Still he can't hear you oh
[37:00] when the devil tells
[37:02] you that you're too
[37:05] far that you're too far from
[37:09] God that you're out of
[37:12] reach that you're too
[37:16] low he cried that much
[37:22] more he cried that much
[37:26] more sometimes we're the
[37:30] opposite we
[37:36] dwindle we stop Yes we let people
[37:40] silence
[37:43] us are we not Royal
[37:45] [Music]
[37:47] seed that we're not burst out of royal
[37:56] bloodas
[38:00] God provided that
[38:07] lamb I'd like to make my third
[38:14] comparison with brother
[38:19] brandham he says in the message
[38:26] perfection
[38:33] it's going to
[38:35] be uh 11 okay in English in
[38:40] English it says although the Old
[38:42] Testament they
[38:49] offered the blood of Lamb's and
[38:56] goats sheep bulls and heers is um
[39:03] toos I don't have it here yeah just keep
[39:05] going a substitutionary
[39:10] death but all in the great economy of
[39:14] God
[39:16] listen there was back in his mind the
[39:19] real object
[39:23] coming so all these sacrifices of
[39:26] animals
[39:30] were
[39:32] types of the real sacrifice to
[39:36] come notice he says in God's Great
[39:42] economy I wonder how great it
[39:45] is to satisfy your
[39:48] thirst your
[39:50] hunger how rich is
[39:54] God nothing in this world can satisfy us
[39:59] but thank God that he
[40:03] can says and the real object was to
[40:09] come was his only begotten
[40:13] son all the Lambs that
[40:17] died was only a
[40:21] shadow and a shadow is only the negative
[40:24] side of an
[40:26] object
[40:31] and they only
[40:35] spoke
[40:37] wow Eden only
[40:40] spoke Eden Eden the Garden of
[40:45] Eden after the
[40:47] fall only spoke of
[40:52] Calvary the calvary
[40:56] coming
[40:58] he says in paragraph
[41:02] 25 and he's already
[41:08] judged does this calm anybody
[41:12] tonight is in this good
[41:15] news and he's already
[41:20] judged you don't have to worry about
[41:25] judgments as I turn and look at the
[41:27] little
[41:32] crucifix I realize that it represents
[41:34] his
[41:37] body and now that body has already been
[41:43] judged God can't justly judge it
[41:50] again for it's already
[41:54] judged God struck the judgments of of
[41:57] death upon that
[42:03] body
[42:06] wow I don't want to be
[42:09] judged and this is what we have to
[42:13] do and as long as I can find a way to
[42:16] get hid in that
[42:24] body this should make us cry brother
[42:29] get to our
[42:30] [Music]
[42:34] knees his
[42:36] judgment was
[42:38] struck for
[42:40] [Music]
[42:41] me for
[42:43] me and for
[42:47] you we are
[42:50] free the prophet
[42:53] says we are
[42:56] free
[43:00] Romans 81
[43:03] said there is therefore now no
[43:09] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[43:15] Jesus this is the
[43:17] key write it
[43:21] down that walk not after the
[43:26] flesh
[43:27] that walk not after the
[43:34] flesh what do we walk
[43:43] after but after the
[43:49] spirit living in the
[43:52] spirit not in the
[43:55] flesh there you are he
[43:58] says no
[44:01] condemnation I don't care what comes or
[44:04] what
[44:07] goes I don't care what comes or what
[44:11] goes we have to not
[44:15] care that's the
[44:17] problem we care too
[44:23] much we care too much what comes and
[44:26] goes
[44:35] he says you are
[44:38] HID you are HID
[44:43] beneath the
[44:46] blood no matter what comes or
[44:51] goes don't
[44:53] care care about
[44:56] that
[44:57] don't care about
[44:59] here this is not our
[45:02] home pilate told Jesus at the Judgment
[45:06] seat
[45:10] pilot why don't you send your angels to
[45:13] come save
[45:17] you why don't
[45:19] you that's a good
[45:22] question check the
[45:25] answer he says
[45:27] I could call my
[45:32] father he didn't want to make a show
[45:35] there he said I could call my
[45:40] father but this is not my
[45:44] kingdom my kingdom will
[45:50] come he didn't care about this
[45:55] world
[45:59] he was
[46:02] silent and he took it like a
[46:06] champ he finished the
[46:10] mission and he walked straight
[46:13] up with one goal in his
[46:17] mind to buy the children of
[46:25] God
[46:29] I'm G be I'm sorry I was going to close

[49:07] by uh the the um the love that you have
[49:10] for the Lord's
[49:13] work uh should uh continually uh you
[49:16] know uh
[49:18] grow you know you should have that
[49:22] desire uh more and more every
[49:25] year uh you know that's when you really
[49:30] know uh that the Lord is is growing in
[49:35] you that the love that you
[49:38] have uh you know for his
[49:41] people uh it's it's a
[49:44] sign you know it's something that that
[49:47] just you just can't you just can't not
[49:51] go uh you just uh there's something in
[49:55] you you you may be left you know in you
[49:59] may not have a dime left in the
[50:03] bank but that's
[50:05] okay uh because uh that's not going to
[50:08] stop
[50:09] me it shouldn't stop
[50:12] you uh for doing something for the
[50:16] Lord uh we should continually do
[50:20] it and you know that's why we do it you
[50:23] know we had a great
[50:24] time uh you know I just it was it was
[50:27] very
[50:28] special and uh you know the Lord uh we
[50:31] we uh got two more souls for the Lord
[50:34] amen and you know uh we're just we're
[50:37] just snatching them from the
[50:40] devil you know we're just bringing them
[50:44] back and it just brings me great
[50:48] joy uh you know and you just snatch him
[50:50] from the devil's
[50:52] hands you know
[50:54] just just when he thought he had them
[50:58] just when he thought that they were his
[51:00] trophies uh you know the the Lord uh the
[51:03] Lord did the
[51:05] work you know and and uh and you know
[51:07] he's Victorious
[51:09] amen uh but uh going back uh you know
[51:12] and God bless the
[51:14] brothers for their efforts as
[51:16] well everything they do for
[51:19] us just it's just uh you could feel
[51:23] it you know they give you their heart
[51:26] and I believe that you know the Lord has
[51:28] a great reward for them as
[51:32] well God bless
[51:34] them uh but when we uh talk about you
[51:36] know a good
[51:40] Friday uh you know I I I was uh I was
[51:43] just kind of
[51:46] meditating and uh you know being it
[51:48] being that it's
[51:50] Friday uh you know most the time you use
[51:55] service
[51:57] and uh you know uh but I was
[52:00] thinking you know uh I've always asked
[52:03] I've always asked
[52:05] myself I personally always ask myself
[52:10] questions and uh I'm like what's so good
[52:13] what was so good about Good
[52:16] Friday you know what what what's what is
[52:19] Good
[52:21] Friday you know some of the popular
[52:25] beliefs
[52:31] one is is that uh one of the answers
[52:33] that I found is that it's the time of
[52:35] Jesus's
[52:38] crucifixion says it may have referred to
[52:41] Holy instead of
[52:44] good uh so you know that that's one of
[52:47] the thoughts behind
[52:50] that you know another
[52:52] one is that you know because Jesus
[52:55] couldn't have been resurrected without
[53:00] dying since the day of his death is in a
[53:02] sense a
[53:05] good it says that terrible
[53:09] Friday that has been called a good
[53:15] Friday because it led to the
[53:17] resurrection of
[53:21] Jesus and his victory over death and
[53:25] sin
[53:27] and and you know that's the very
[53:28] Pinnacle of Christ of Christian
[53:34] celebration or it's the peak of
[53:37] it you know that that that you know he
[53:40] obtained the victory
[53:42] amen you know another one is is that you
[53:46] know good that good in Good
[53:52] Friday uh it was it was derived from
[53:55] from God's Friday
[54:01] uh the you know the that's that's what
[54:04] some people
[54:06] believe oh you know and I I believe you
[54:08] know every day is God's
[54:11] day it wasn't just a good
[54:15] Friday uh but you know any day could be
[54:17] God's
[54:19] day uh but this was this was uh this was
[54:22] just a
[54:25] preparation of something
[54:28] better of something better that was
[54:31] coming you know and I know you know the
[54:34] youth you know because I've asked myself
[54:36] the same
[54:38] question it's like man how could uh
[54:42] suffering how could
[54:45] pain you know how could uh you know all
[54:48] these uh the the
[54:52] mocking you know and and and you know
[54:54] getting spit on
[54:57] H how could that be something
[55:02] good how could it
[55:04] be uh you know but I believe you know it
[55:07] was Good
[55:10] Friday because this was the
[55:13] beginning this was the beginning of
[55:15] something
[55:18] better uh this is where Jesus
[55:22] died you see because Jesus
[55:25] said oh you know after he he he uh he
[55:28] had the vinegar poured in his
[55:32] mouth he said it is
[55:36] finished but you know I
[55:38] believe that that was only the
[55:43] beginning of something
[55:46] better that was to
[55:49] come amen amen now if you can type that
[55:53] if you can type
[55:55] that
[55:57] oh you know
[55:59] death you know death begins right
[56:03] here it begins at the
[56:07] altar so you know if you
[56:09] want if you want to see something
[56:13] better you need to come to the
[56:16] altar because after
[56:19] death it only it only opens the scene
[56:22] for
[56:24] you it opens it up for you
[56:29] amen that's what I believe it opens up
[56:32] the
[56:34] scene yes amen that's what that's
[56:37] exactly what it
[56:40] does so uh when we talk about these
[56:44] things you know and brother Isaac was
[56:46] talking about you know the
[56:50] sacrifice you know and uh and and you
[56:52] know
[56:54] obviously you know in order for there to
[56:56] be a
[57:00] sacrifice you know there has to be there
[57:02] has to be a love for
[57:06] something not not only do they go call
[57:08] it good
[57:12] Friday but they also call it passion
[57:18] Friday that's right you know uh when you
[57:21] have passion for
[57:24] something uh you know it just just
[57:26] stimulate something inside of
[57:30] you you know and when you love
[57:34] God oh you know it just it just does
[57:36] something to
[57:39] you there's just a there's just a
[57:41] passion inside
[57:43] you you see you can you can love a lot
[57:45] of
[57:46] things and not have them amen amen how
[57:51] many believe that you know there's
[57:53] people that love
[57:55] money oh but they don't have it oh
[57:58] there's people that love
[58:01] cars oh they love
[58:03] houses or they love their
[58:05] phones or they just they just love so
[58:08] many
[58:09] things and they wish they had
[58:12] it but I'm going to tell you
[58:15] something you can love
[58:17] God and if you love
[58:20] him you can have
[58:22] them you can you can have God
[58:27] if you love them I don't believe there's
[58:30] a person
[58:32] here that if they have true love for
[58:37] God and not have
[58:39] him but if you love
[58:42] him you can have him he's yours you can
[58:46] have his
[58:48] promises you can have his
[58:51] healing you can have his
[58:54] Deliverance you just ask ask him
[58:56] whatever you
[58:58] want if you love him or you can have
[59:04] them and I thank Judas for
[59:07] that I thank Judas for
[59:10] that because like I've said
[59:13] before and we can learn something from
[59:16] him because
[59:18] Judas Judas didn't give him a fake a
[59:21] fake
[59:25] Jesus was not the fake
[59:28] Jesus but he gave them the real
[59:31] thing and that's what the people
[59:35] want they want the real Jesus they want
[59:38] the real
[59:42] Jesus they want
[59:45] him there's a Russian
[59:49] proverb Russo R and it says
[59:55] this it says I'd rather be slapped in
[59:58] the face with the
[1:00:06] truth than given a kiss with a
[1:00:11] lie amen amen sometimes I
[1:00:16] believe you know when you come to
[1:00:19] church are how many want to hear a
[1:00:22] lie we come to hear the
[1:00:24] truth and sometimes you got to get
[1:00:28] slapped
[1:00:31] around and Jesus got
[1:00:33] slapped like you know and he and it it
[1:00:36] was for a
[1:00:37] cause and it was a good
[1:00:40] cause and I want to tell you that that
[1:00:44] cause is right here uh the reason that
[1:00:48] that you're
[1:00:49] here the reason Jesus got
[1:00:53] slapped the reason he got mocked
[1:00:58] the reason he got spit
[1:01:00] on was the
[1:01:03] passion that he had for his
[1:01:08] children I believe
[1:01:12] that we can't see it many
[1:01:15] times we don't understand it uh you know
[1:01:19] there's been so many
[1:01:20] things in my life and I just failed to
[1:01:24] understand them
[1:01:27] but you know I want to tell
[1:01:29] you that as you grow in the
[1:01:32] Lord as you grow in the things of
[1:01:37] God as you begin to
[1:01:41] sacrifice as you begin to let go of
[1:01:45] things uh that that is
[1:01:49] when God begins to open your
[1:01:53] eyes you begin to see
[1:01:57] that what you thought was
[1:02:01] evil it actually worked out for the
[1:02:06] good you know thought that's one of the
[1:02:08] St
[1:02:10] scriptures that I always clung
[1:02:14] to I didn't quite understand
[1:02:18] it but I memorized
[1:02:22] it and when something appeared to be bad
[1:02:28] when it it didn't make sense to
[1:02:31] me when it didn't make sense to
[1:02:34] me I would repeat that
[1:02:37] verse and we know that all things work
[1:02:40] together for the
[1:02:42] good but to those who love
[1:02:45] God but to those who are the
[1:02:49] called according to his
[1:02:53] purpose you know and that's the thing
[1:02:56] when you love
[1:02:58] them and your eyes your eyes begin to
[1:03:02] open
[1:03:03] up and you begin to see the God's
[1:03:06] Redemptive
[1:03:10] plan and you begin to
[1:03:12] see that just the coming to
[1:03:15] church there's actually a purpose behind
[1:03:19] it oh brother brandham says
[1:03:22] this he says this in the message God
[1:03:24] talked to Moses
[1:03:27] he says preaching
[1:03:30] healing preaching all God's Redemptive
[1:03:35] blessings he's here
[1:03:38] tonight his spirit's
[1:03:40] here his glory is here his power is
[1:03:45] here his Joy is
[1:03:47] here his love is
[1:03:50] here his power is
[1:03:52] here his spirit's here his servants are
[1:03:58] here his word is here he is here
[1:04:03] himself everything that he died
[1:04:06] for is here for
[1:04:09] you it's here for
[1:04:11] you or you can grab hold of
[1:04:14] it you don't have to leave
[1:04:17] empty-handed or you can take whatever
[1:04:19] you
[1:04:21] want God's not going to run
[1:04:24] out he let let the spirit go he let the
[1:04:28] spirit
[1:04:29] go see we got to let
[1:04:32] go but Jesus gave up the
[1:04:36] spirit he he gave it
[1:04:40] up that was part of the
[1:04:44] plan you got to let
[1:04:49] go amen amen how many believe
[1:04:54] that Hallelujah I believe it with all my
[1:05:04] heart see it may have appeared
[1:05:11] evil the
[1:05:14] crucifixion at the
[1:05:16] moment all his
[1:05:19] disciples and even whenever we when
[1:05:22] things don't go our
[1:05:24] way
[1:05:27] when when things don't go as
[1:05:31] planned cuz we all we all have some kind
[1:05:34] of story that's going on in our
[1:05:40] head even the
[1:05:42] [Music]
[1:05:43] adults not just talking about the
[1:05:46] youth we all have something in our mind
[1:05:49] the way that things are supposed to be
[1:05:50] played
[1:05:52] out you got the characters and
[1:05:54] everything
[1:06:55] crucifixion was
[1:06:58] happening before that
[1:07:02] crucifixion there was there was they
[1:07:04] they released one
[1:07:08] prisoner that's right one prisoner would
[1:07:12] be
[1:07:13] released
[1:07:15] amen and uh you know the
[1:07:18] people that you know uh they uh they
[1:07:21] called they wanted
[1:07:24] Barabas they who should we set
[1:07:28] free a Barabas or
[1:07:31] Jesus and you know I believe at that
[1:07:34] moment not a single one raised their
[1:07:36] hand for
[1:07:39] Jesus not a single
[1:07:42] one you know we live in a
[1:07:44] time of where people they'd rather deal
[1:07:48] with a
[1:07:51] drunker a drug
[1:07:53] addict a thief
[1:07:57] a
[1:07:59] murderer oh they'd rather deal with
[1:08:01] somebody like
[1:08:04] that are they with
[1:08:06] Jesus they they don't want anything to
[1:08:09] do with
[1:08:11] them I hope that's not the
[1:08:14] case I hope that's not the case
[1:08:20] tonight now we're talking about a
[1:08:24] release
[1:08:27] I'm closing
[1:08:31] now but when we talk
[1:08:33] about this
[1:08:38] release there was one
[1:08:43] person that would be let
[1:08:49] go and you know maybe
[1:08:53] uh maybe Barabas didn't know what was
[1:08:59] happening maybe at that
[1:09:02] moment he had just heard of
[1:09:07] Jesus
[1:09:14] faintly you know maybe somebody
[1:09:21] testifying but
[1:09:24] uh
[1:09:26] [Music]
[1:09:27] you know uh maybe he heard the jailers
[1:09:30] come
[1:09:36] in and they said
[1:09:39] Barabas you're
[1:09:43] free you're you're free to you're you're
[1:09:45] free to
[1:09:49] go and uh perhabs didn't
[1:09:53] understand he didn't understand what was
[1:09:55] happening
[1:09:58] he was probably like what how how is
[1:10:04] this and he steps
[1:10:07] out you know they releases the
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:13] shackles from his hands and
[1:10:18] feet and maybe as he walked out of the
[1:10:24] prison
[1:10:26] he said who who who set me
[1:10:32] free and he looked
[1:10:34] up he looked up to Mount
[1:10:38] Calvary and he saw
[1:10:41] Jesus and they said that man right
[1:10:44] there that
[1:10:46] man that man carrying the
[1:10:51] cross that one that was Carri your sins
[1:10:56] the one that carried your
[1:10:59] guilt the one that carried your
[1:11:02] shame the one that carried it
[1:11:05] all he's the
[1:11:08] reason that you were
[1:11:10] free you're free to

[1:13:16] heart like I

[1:13:24] finished the work of Jesus was
[1:13:29] finished but he had to release the
[1:13:33] spirit because he
[1:13:36] knew that there was going to be
