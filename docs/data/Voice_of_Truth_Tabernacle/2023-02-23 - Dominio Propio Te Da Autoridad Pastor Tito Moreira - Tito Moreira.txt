don't care [Music] last time [Music] man someone leave it we are free of what he has done for us let us open our Bibles to the Book of Revelations chapter 2. it's good to be in the house of the Lord [Music] um rewards the reward of self-dominium is the rewarded the age of the dieteria in lemons titled the self-control gives Authority is and he that overcometh and keepeth my Works unto thee and to him will I give power over the Nations and he shall rule them with the rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter's shall they be broken to Shivers even as I received of my father and I will give him the Morning Star let us pray Heavenly Father how good it is to know that you always that you always come to your uh to your meetings and the Bible says here's a let him hear what the spirit says into the churches for a reason you referred yourself to the church the reason you said what the spirit said to the church because you desire to give this church something Lord Iglesia when we come to church there's something special that you have for us you told us what the spirit you want to hear what you have to say foreign [Music] la La gratification let's go of instant gratification correct we've been speaking on how the control has has his mind is decided on what we're headed towards the fourth summary of this age that I'm going to be giving to you we'll be speaking on this rewards and how self-control gives Authority um a power to control something the context foreign perhaps you remember I don't know if you don't read it with me Matthew chapter 8 verse 5. this is and when Jesus was entered into a Capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him it is and saying Lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented and Jesus said unto him I will come and heal him the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should has come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed in other words Jesus wanted to go over this sickly person this one that was tormented and the Centurion he says it's not necessary for you to go where he is he says because I am also a manager of authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go ahead and to another comments and just my servant do this and he do with it when Jesus I have not found so great face and I say unto you that many shall come from the East and West and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob how tremendous there shall be people like this people that aren't a part of Israel they're not a part of the Patriots but the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness that shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy way and as thou has believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the self-same hours if God could heal a servant of a pagan man or Roman man a Christian that should Elevate our faith now we're taking the story to speak a little bit but he gives it to him of his there's not a greater Authority than Gods we believe it but we truly don't know our lives reflect otherwise because there are things then even the word of God I repeat many of us here we could testify there are things in our lives then the word of God we have gotten many times our faith is much lower than this internship he said you don't even have to go Lord Jesus speak the word and my servant shall heal and we Brothers we have the words we don't give it the authority it deserves over our lives the word of God is very little authorities over lives of human beings much less over something else foreign that's how it should be okay but what happens he doesn't have authority over us because the child of God Jesus Christ not our Authority okay but it's what he did what is his word the reason that's the word of God has so much Authority it's because it comes from God for our lives but we don't give it to him unless somebody gives him the authority of God he doesn't have authority you may have power or he has power God has power over everything but we're the ones that give him the authority over our lives we allow him to use that power over us says a pardon a pardon isn't a pardon unless it's accepted as a party the president himself the one that wrote this note is he wrote that note that in order to deliver that that a person that was in prison he was in prison but the man saw that paper the result was said that a pardon is an apartment it's received as a party the benefits of that word forgiveness give authority to that word so much authority over us that is something great for us because he promised it is [Applause] you have to give it the authority how could you give it something to Authority that you first of all we don't respect sometimes we don't respect the word of God we don't respect what he said it says a lot of things we're like ah technology in order for some someone to have authority over you I'll correct in the correct manner I should say you have to respect that person many people they use the power incorrectly they use it without Authority as in I think they have people who do things forcefully but real Authority maybe father mother Pastor a leader it comes through respect you have to respect the word of God sometimes we don't even respect it but it's the truth don't respect this place we come here without reverence or power over us we should respect his words what does it mean for your life are you quiet because I'm scolding you or because you don't believe what I'm saying you're making me a little nervous oh yeah Centurion oh watch the Centurion he says I understand the authority because I have people under me and I tell them do this and they do it the word of God tells us to do this and we do the contrary yes authority of for us in the word of God then the word of God does come on church it's the truth [Music] the word of the enforcers are on Instagram have more authorities then the word of God yeah foreign and for what we need the devil laughs when we want him to a flee without Authority how are you going to come tell me to leave when you don't have anybody over you don't have anybody in the back you're not under anybody come with your own authority um that is backing him up the devil laughs Brothers how can you your word have more authority over me good question Brothers foreign [Applause] over you the Centurion said I am a man under authorities having soldiers and I said to this man go and he goes until I started to do this and he do with it how tremendous Jezebel she had power paramatar to a Kill yeah and she placed Idols she placed Idols to these priests and the Israelites and the Jewish people let me tell you what power does an idol have entertainment [Music] in the word of God over our lives I mean okay they say is now he says that he who keeps doing Works Faithfully unto the end will be given power of over Nations who can come so powerfully with any situation that even the most desperate enemies his demonstration rule by power will be like unto the very Sons it's much greater than the ones of the Nations [Applause] anything else he would leave we would cast out demons God should move us dead Idols us to believe in him to know that he can do anything Christianity versus idolatry he says he knows if you ever been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ there's a pool full of water here you're rising to walk with Christ in a new life and he raises you up by the Holy Ghost and sets you in Heavenly places with himself far above all powers of this world over all the powers of this world over all the powers of this world not devil as I was was with Moses says brother Bradham in this message recognize that Jesus of Nazareth had authority over sickness for he was a man in Authority now if he's going that way he said come back this way because he's an authority I'm talking about Jesus had that much Authority he must and more sickness I'm not worthy leave your word because we don't respect it foreign muerte in other words your daughters won't be able to do anything and I shall give everyone according to their works all the churches in other words in other words what is under us the denominations don't have power given by God over the cemetery God has no yeah they don't have any spiritual authorities no Spiritual Authority they're just like those dead they can't do anything but a son or daughter of God but below theirs Heavenly fathers as their father has the same Authority the same could you imagine how many believe that Brothers now look in the message and since that time when he was on the cross he said if you're a Son of God then The Descendant will believe when they placed a a filthy garment or the older interactions they're spitting on his face all the soldiers Hawking and spitting on his precious face the drunken and you do something good to them that's yours we need the power of God and to return good for evil can break chains right don't raise your hand but there's some Maniacs here we can break chains and break heads yeah put someone on the ground quick yes or yes Brothers that just proves that we're maniacs but it requires of a real man to return good for evil from his heart not because of a religious Duty Bob from his heart that's not the Son of God let that spit hang in his face [Applause] because my father told me not to do anything you got a story about how Tony is I'm under Authority come on church we need a little bit more don't we um stay still quiet and we talk more we know when God tells us something he says don't open your mouth don't say anything don't answer back he'll know who I am and we ignore it but when we get to the point where God says stay still and we say yes Lord yes if that's what you desire that's what you desire if that's your word if that's what pleases you then it pleases me Lord and that's what I want to do the demons begin to Trembley it's the works of God all right amen and today then the demons begin to tremble y then they don't know what to do SES we're entering into our position as Sons and Daughters where the Holy Ghost has control over us and our Authority is given unto us Jesus Provo Jesus proves moment in those crucial moments that's where he proved it how much power the word of God had over his life there Jesus how much Authority the word of God had over his life how much the word of God how much it matters word of God has over our life that's where Jesus Christ proved that the word of God we're still alive they respected what the Lord said he dare not do something different he said if I wanted to I want it Legion of angels Lord amen how could in that day how could the word of God in that day raises from the dead raise the body that is all corrupted and rotten from the grave when the word of God can't even move us to come to the office giving it that Authority here this is where the thing begins this is where it begins pull us out of this Earth Jesus Christ do you recognize today [Music] how do you recognize expect him to recognize you when you're in the tombs if you don't recognize him today if his word does nothing for us I say Lord okay how miserable I am the word hardly moves me Lord fight with us they have to yell at us keep speaking to us we're like oh one little step with so much pain or so much yelling it's almost that's how we are brothers as a pastor would you become discouraged but the word of God says I shouldn't complain but you become to get discouraged we have so many messages we listened oh Lord what else does God have to do the reality is we don't love him enough [Music] in order for his word to mean something in our lives the truth is we don't respect his word we read the Bible as if it was like homework when it's a letter of love when it's the orders of Our Lord that's why our faith is weak because the authority of the the scriptures of the Holy Ghost man no wonder the Lord praised this uh Centurion so much he said he just wants my word would there be somebody here yes let's say Lord take me to that point like the Centurion as long as I know that you said that means so much to me send me wherever you desire to send me foreign do with me as you please these Saints from statutory they got a hold of that a little bit of work that's what kept him that's what kept Him just that little bit of word they grabbed the hold of the little that they had if it's just one word today grab hold of it because say Lord I want to put it to a work or a place I want to be what you desire me to be musicians can't come forward what does the word mean to you no wonder the Bible says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom fear there means respect that means a fear to fail him what he says to love what he says because when you love what he says you're scared of failing I don't know to what level the word of God moves you yourself have to answer that question foreign [Music] if he says go do you go if he says come to you come [Music] on I don't know how much power the word of God has over your life if you want authorities if you want those demons and depend on idols come on to the authority of God's word come and say Lord here I am I want to love your words more than life itself I want to love what you say okay I want you to move me Lord [Music] I want to hear the message that it would move me I don't want a seared conscience I don't want to just come to church and nothing happens why because I didn't give you that authority over my life would you give him that
