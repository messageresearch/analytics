the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] spee and [Music] St [Music] [Music] oh [Music] amen [Music] hallelujah [Music] amen God bless you [Music] Brothers it's a pleasure to be with you a great greeting to our brothers and those that watch us through the internet along with my brothers we'll be speaking on [Music] John and we want to focus a little bit on John for the [Music] Youth I invite you to open your Bibles to the Book of Luke 1: 13 or the youth last week they spoke on and his name was John they tell it his name was John I want to continue on what they uh they spoke but I I wanted get I want to speak on the point where the angel spoke to his father Luke 113 says but the angel said to him zear Zechariah do not be afraid for your prayer has been heard and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son and you will call her name his name and you will have a joy and gladness and May and many Will Rejoice at his birth because he will be great before God he will not drink wine or strong drink and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb and he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God let us bow our heads Brothers blessed Heavenly Father we're so thankful to be a be able to be here before your children father thank you for my pastor for giv me the opportunity to be here and for you for giving me the thought that it would be a [Music] blessing that I would not say an incorrect word help me and my brothers help my interpreter I ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen you may be seated Brothers here in the Book of Luke I like what it said because truly John he had a very peculiar [Music] birth because the angel Gabriel he appeared before zaras when he was ding his doing his duties in the temple but we see the situation that Zechariah even being a a priest he doubted the angel Gabriel he said your wife will bear a son but he doubted so we see [Music] there that we could but sometimes a miracle we can't believe it it seems impossible in back in the old times a woman that was Barren that that was a a a curse that's why Elizabeth she was so anxious to have a child so we see that the Lord fulfills that desire for Zacharias but due to the circumstances of not believing the Lord Jesus makes him adult the the angel says you will be a a mute for not believing until your son is born so we see throughout a lapse of time when John is born we're talking about six months he was older than the Lord Jesus he is born I have it here Luke 157 says it says when when the time came for Elizabeth to have her child and when they they see that that he was born and and he had and he he had become [Music] great and they rejoiced greatly with her so the the neighbors began to ask her what will the child's name be they said it will be will it be Zacharias like his father the mother said no his name will be John at the moment that she said her father Zachariah he he was able to speak so something was happening with that child something was going to be done because many things had happened in such a short lapse of time the Lord Jesus Christ Was preparing this child this child is left without parents because if you remember his mother was elderly and his father was as well right the majority of them were they were Elders older people but the historians say this that it was he was it was at the age of five his father his parents had passed away and historian says I was doing a little bit of studying and I found it in that way John is left without parents why because God has something prepared for John why does he leave without parents isn't that a little you would say it's the selfish of God that way couldn't it have been a different way sometimes we say as young people Lord why don't you answer my prayers why am I like this why can't I believe you have you ever asked yourself that you I asked myself could it be that my my prayer doesn't even reach the the roof of my house or do my prayers not go to your ear why do you want to leave me alone why can't I change why can't I be a better son why can't be why can't it be better at praying why because God youth I believe God is teaching you to to be left alone without father and mother God wants to prepare you my my my brethren the ministers say that you are the new Next Generation that you will be taking so have you asked yourself that you when you feel alone God is preparing you for something John at the age of nine he goes into the Wilderness Why without father and mother [Music] uh there's a very important couple in the life of John and they were they were perhaps the Elders of the church when John was born but they died as well so John at the age of nine enters the Wilderness why is that because God has something prepared for him God takes him to the Wilderness at the age of nineo said last Friday he had he made an example of of a brother Samuel son that is when that's when he went into the Wilderness God wanted to show John something right God he's just off the face the Earth for 30 years per 30 years from being a child he disappears him until the age of 30 so watch how God they said that that he Locus where does that food appear in the in the wilderness I asked myself where did it come from there was no water there wasn't anything where does the locust come from so God even then he takes care of his children youth if you feel alone if you feel like you can't Advance God working with you sooner or later you will but God has been working inside don't get desperate joh didn't get desperate in in the I imagine that joh when he went into the Wilderness he perhaps thought I have a childhood like the rest children playing Jalem or in Judea but John didn't understand that because God had to prepare God doesn't tell you his purposes until afterward because you don't understand we can't understand the mind of God John goes into the Wilderness he disappears for 30 years imagine at the age of 30 God preparing his children after 30 years he appears he says a voice crying in Wilderness it was E I looked for the definition of echo and I I I could uh I I understood that it was it a voice that's that's resonating in that resonating voice he went out preaching repentance youth I want to speak of a repentance that has been spoken of and I believe that John didn't speak of that repentance joh spoke of a different type of repentance the meaning of repentance it is it is uh much more than than just thinking you've done wrong it's a change it's changing the way of thinking and in the heart that provides A New Perspective of God of oneself and of the world it involves turning away from sin and turning to God for forgiveness youth when John comes out of the Wilderness his Echo his voice it comes preaching repentance I don't come to preach uh repentance that when you make a mistake you say Lord forgive me no it's a different repentance changing our mentality on how we God at that time the Lord Jesus Christ he was already preaching the Pharisees and the Sadducees we already thinking differently against the Lord Jes so the echo of John goes out and says to but not repenting of your sins but repent of the mentality that they had that Jesus Christ was already there repenting of your mentality that the Lord Jesus Christ is here now in the message believest thou this uh preached in uh it says oh wow I can see our Master when he arrives with that Darkness behind [Music] him that he was an illegitimate son but God always sends a warning before coming he sent a man named John the Baptist he was a great Forerunner of Jesus God always sends a forerunner before a great event you realize youth the Lord Jesus Christ 400 years before sending John let's bring it to our time you the Lord Jesus Christ said Willam marrying brandham he opened everything up for us he's the prophet of this time they say that he sends a prophet before a great event happen so in this time the Lord Jesus Christ was going to come that's why he prepared John John was a important vessel in our time the Lord Jesus Christ sent brother to prepare us I don't know if the time May tear but if it does you will be the next Generation you will preach this message you will stand for this message just like our pastor stand and the rest of the ministry here our brothers you will be the next Generation you so the prophet he came in this time to prepare us youth to let us know just like John the bapti that something great is coming I don't know how much time but something great is coming John comes and preaches that Mighty Echo that many people heard mother everyone heard it and he baptized why because he had to change the the thought of how Christianity was seen the Lord Jesus Christ came with another many say like the Pharisees said that he he had he but Lord Jesus Christ came to bring Grace because the law kth youth the letter kth but if you've seen our he gives himself completely I've always told never stop telling you if I was in Mexico if my P I believe it would be another thing you have the privilege to have you a pastor like brother Tito Mora it's a privilege youth don't waste time if God leaves you alone for a little bit don't be fearful God is preparing You Youth young men young God is preparing for something great God prepares for something great youth we have a great pastor and not because he's here because it has been revealed to me he's the great Pastor that will be guiding us to the feet of Jesus he worries for you you he loves you and I believe that that that God loves you that's why we're here worshiping him and praising can with all of our heart and with that I want to introduce my uh brother Blas he he says like this he says John he came prepared after after the Wilderness John had something special John he he he he didn't think much of himself go John let let go of everything he was going to be the next priest because his father was a priest but he rejected that he even rejected to say he was a prophet because a greater one that him was there he let go of everything he he let everything go and with that I'll brother BL God bless you my brothers are you happy Brothers the Lord Jesus Christ clap a little bit nervous Brothers glory to God Brothers God is here and we're speaking on John the Baptist a man sent by God brother the title is the power of self-denial what power John had let go of himself That's What Makes a Man Great Brothers is getting rid of himself but to rid yourself of yourself you need the holy spirit because I believe brothers that it's very nice when they tell you when they compliment you tell you did a good job or you did this or the other the honor is for you Brothers it feels nice but when you work on on a team you're going to say my team that did the work on behalf of God you don't get the glory for our Lord Jesus Christ quickly just want to read the scripture and Luke uh 15 verse1 15 for he will be for he will be great in the sight of the Lord and drink neither wine nor strong drink and he will also be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb John the Baptist Brothers as our brother gel said as our Brothers pre last Friday we all know that he came with a peculiar birth that birth was uh it was unique but he was filled with the Holy Spirit the most tremendous like I tell you is the power of denying oneself he at the age of nine years old he went to the desert he didn't have a life like you and I what did not what a child desires at a young age are toys Brothers they're toys a a child wants to play he wants to have fun and enjoy his childhood a man sent by God Brothers purpose on Earth Brothers been the next priest he could have been the next priest Brothers he came generation from the geney of Aaron he was the he had zaras heed all of that to serve God In His glory how beautiful that is youth how beautiful it is to serve the Lord he had a job Brothers when young when in your youth what you want is to quickly drink to go have fun at parties is to try wine Brothers is to say as a prophet [Music] said when he's seen that woman drinking this is life that's not life that is death this here is life is True Life The Gospel this is the you young man young lady you have a calling you have to honor your body you have to deny yourself John brothers look was a man sent by God to manifest to fulfill what was said of him years ago Isaiah was prophesying about him Isaiah 43 says the voice of one crying in the desert prepare you the way of the Lord strain the path to our Lord all valleys be raised up and mountains be laid low and that which is twisted stra and the bitter shall be made swe BL be the name of the Lord years ago Isaiah was prophesying of this Prophet Brothers good it is to do the will of the Lord many times we want to turn our back to our call we want to be comfortable we want to be relaxed but this boy this child went to the desert to the look at what Exodus 8 [Music] says Deuteronomy chapter 8 look at what it says Brothers how God children to the desert there's a motive Brothers to the desert and relaxed there's no one there your your dad's not there your mom's not there your uncle's not there your your brother's not there there's no one there it's just you and God there and you have to cry out there you have to cry out you're going to cry out I don't think you gone through any of that Brothers but Brothers God is one day going to put us in a situation we're going to cry out to him and that is for every son every daughter of God every child's son must be and I tell you this through experience I remember the testimony that our brother Diego said to go work in Colorado Springs and they had an experience Brothers their Dad or Mom wasn't there with and there you find how much you need a mother a father Brothers Pastor Brothers be the Lord Brothers God is good Brothers we're going to need to go through those the prophet says God takes us through bitter water and that is good brother it serves for our growth chapter8 verse one every commandment which I command you today you must be careful to observe that you may live in multiplying going and possess the land of which the Lord swore to your fathers and you shall remember that led you all the way these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble you and test you to know what was in your heart whether you keep his Commandments or not that's where you show your true colors what you really are what what you have inside of you brother said if I were to go to the desert at night I would leave John had a job to prepare he was predestined our Lord Jesus Christ he was not just any man Brothers Brothers he was born he was born with the Holy Spirit Brothers he had that level of greatness he was the only man that was positionally placed by God positioned by God in that day Brothers he had his rights as a son of a priest he had rights brother but he surrendered all of those rights as our Prophet says a Son of God a lamb sheep gives forth all of its rights sister you have rights you have to surrender those rights young man say to your mom mom I have the right to do this or you youth but the prophet says that Son of God he surrenders his rights you could come and say Brothers I need to do this or the other because they're my rights Brothers surrender your rights Brothers surrendered all of his rights Brothers he preferred that life in the desert to serve God God is good brother and God is not going to remain with he left the desert God God rewarded him in public in public he also had Brothers John the Baptist Brothers attributes I believe that he had been born with that attribute to be the prophet of God how many believe that you have attributes brother believe Brothers just as God in the beginning I don't speak speak what I've heard from the prophet conduct order and says that in the beginning the Lord God was Elohim that is the object of wor and he wasn't even God then because there was nothing to worship him there was no one to worship how was he going to display those attributes if there was no one to worship he wanted to have but how would he have that attribute to being a doctor there was no one to get sick how could have the attribute of a Healer sorry or of being healer if there was no one to be sick right of a savior there was no one lost believe with all of my heart that you used I when I was a little younger a girl playing with her dog it bothered me I don't know why bothered me Brothers but now reading the message Prophet says that you young lady you also have the attribute of being mother that's why you would hold that dog young man you have the attribute of being a father of being a son be the Lord Brothers those attributes Brothers they're there you have to come one day John the Baptist he had that that attribute of being a prophet he was filled with the Holy Spirit but he didn't he didn't he didn't glorify himself he didn't about it he didn't boast that he was filled with the Holy Spirit he preferred to live a life for God you took him to the desert to to afflict them to test him to see what was in his heart oh Lord blessed be the Lord they tell us oh go to such we don't want to go Brothers bless be the Lord Brothers think that we're doing the will of God we're not doing it brothers and if we go we go bothered and as we said he surrendered all his rights to the only god of Glory he was his son he was his sheep every sheep surrenders not mattering where it might find I don't know about in this territory today the women claim to have rights when a married woman brother when she gives all of her rights to her husband bless be the Lord the pastor has told us one day when the groom and the bride when they get married behind the Bell she gives him all her rights but today the woman doesn't want to give up her the Lord help us Brothers blessed be the [Applause] Lord we're gonna keep going a little bit I have two minutes I have two minutes John the Baptist Brothers he had he had the power to deny self-denying power when he left the desert there were many that came and found and they said who are you some say you are Elijah and others that you're the Messiah he said I'm not I'm not greatness of this man the greatness of man is to deny yourself Brothers want to take the honor and glory for ourselves the prophet Brothers he came the spirit of Elijah and many would tell him oh you're the prophet brother God incarn said don't say that Brothers you make me an antichrist humility of the Son of God of a Son of God He makes himself small our lord Jesus could be greater he points us to he doesn't come speaking of himself Redeemer of his gets excited brother he gets excited upon speaking of hisat get the honor the glory for himself brother if you if you have something when I got to this place I began to give problems to our pastor I brought him my problems but I believe brother that a pastor Brothers he is a shepher who is caring for the Sheep until our lord Jesus confid he is the head and I brother telling the pastor my problem I know brother he's going to give me words of encouragement my time is up I'm G to give the spot to my brother and may God bless you [Applause] Brothers amen amen God bless you will there be someone here that came to the house of the will there be someone here that can recognize that this is your house house and as the scripture says that when you draw close to your house or come raise your hands God is here it appears as though we're in a that the people they depend on the on the preacher to motivate but when you come to his house you understand that God is here the prophet says God extends his hand into the change and there he takes out a coins that are worth dollar coins that are worth 10 cents perhaps of five cents and maybe there's a couple pennies as well and sometimes you get rid of the of the penny but uh the prophet says don't get rid of the penny because sooner or later God uses the pennies so then God he has offices he has different callings simply see that it's God soon or later God uses the scense they were needed how many cents make a dollar 100 cents make a dollar there were 100 lots to form an Abraham amen amen but it doesn't matter what God's called you to predestined you to be a scent one cent and you be the best one cent that the best penny you can be every Son of God is predestined amen we can read the scripture there in John chapter 1 verse 6 every Son of God predestined for a good work had been announced by the prophet Isaiah to do a good work and here was being the manifestation of the word that John was the Living Word John was the word that had been expressed and he was a man of the moment he was God on the scene through a man amen amen how many believe it Brothers there was a man sent from God whose name was John who sent him God sent him and his name was can can you help me preach tonight his name was John this saying came for a witness to Bear witness of the light there was John here being manifest to give a witness a testimony of the light or that John was an ambassador he was a representative he was God on the scene there was John being the light of the moment he was not the light but he was bearing witness of the light do you understand me that all men through him might believe it's tremendous how it is that John is there with a purpose so that the people could see the light but he has a responsibility upon him to reflect that light so that the people might believe in him the light through John amen amen he was not the light that he might come and bear witness of the light amen Amen brother Bram says that the bride the groom left but the bride is here she is that which is reflecting the sunlight he is the Sun but we reflect that that he is what a tremendous responsibility has fallen on these because it says that the times are dark that we live in the in the worst age and we say that those that are resting they cannot be perfect but they are waiting on us see the youth nowadays and I say Lord if I was Paul I waiting on the Youth of today I would be crying in my tomb in the grave and saying Lord Lord please raise up the youth they are the future of this message they are responsible to live the life they are responsible to project the light they aren't the light but the light will be projected amongst through these youth what a responsibility the times are dark what has befallen you you us and I wanted to preach hard to the youth I wanted to a preach hard but I was meditating and the Holy Spirit came down he came down into my heart and he told me remember he said remember that is not all the message don't hit the youth he told me he said the prophet said is not delinquency child delinquency he said I said Lord it's true there is not a delinquency in the youth but he said it's parent delinquency and if your son or your daughter is in the condition they're in it's your fault parents because you haven't stood you haven't lived a life you haven't shown the way and that's why the youth today can't receive anything you can see a a youth that's struggling and you tell your son pray son but stop telling your son to pray show him how to work Brothers don't tell him to read your Bible son but show him how to read the Bible it's time to stand as parents we are responsible to bring that to our children and that is what God told me and I wanted to share that there is not delinquency of Youth of child who will show your child I will show my children how a Christian ought to be sometimes we attack Our Youth and we judge them and we we uh exceed on them but we are the responsible ones to live the higher the higher form of life highest form of life is in this message there's not a higher life than this John was the light of the he was responsible for reflecting that light brother brandom says in the message the word God calls for a total separation from unbelief the prophet says now if God said let there be light and there was no light then that wasn't God that said it amen amen When God says anything must back up what he says how many believe it when the word of God has been Vindicated the word been Vindicated that is the light now the word itself is light until it's a Vindicated light so it doesn't matter how much is spoken it doesn't matter how much is expressed that one day John would come but it hadn't happened yet or that light had not yet been reflected until the moment that John was born was indication of what God had spoken way back when there was a prophet there was the word expressed being manifested in the appointed time and there was John amen John's age John's age it can be spoken for a lot of time the word of God can but it has to come the point of its manifestation and the prophet says that that there is the light the light because if God said let there be [Music] light he waited for the light and there was no light brother then God didn't speak because when God speaks because when God speaks things come to existence because he spoken God prophesied that John would come and there was John very witness of the light he was the word expressed say Oh Glory to God Brothers how beautiful how precious it is that he came to become that a word expressed that light in the darkness preaching repentance but let me tell you the the scripture says that among those born of a woman ju John has been the greatest of them all amen amen there was none greater than John of those born of a woman how tremendous John the word expressed the prophet of the moment but the scripture says that those of the the children of the kingdom of the childrens of the Kingdom the smallest is greater than John no you didn't you didn't you didn't catch it you see that's why the prophet says that the day that the bride the day that the bride that she knows who she is many times we don't know who we are but a a a son of of the Kingdom a a child of God born again by the Holy Spirit are filled with the holy spirit that has been born of the spirit he's greater than John do you believe it brother of those of a woman there's been none greater than John but of those who've been born in the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ they're greater than John why brothers because those are your rights for him to die on the cross of Calvary he gave us those rights to be children to be Sons how many rights do we have you you live under every right that God has given us but a son born of the Holy Spirit he's greater than John and God thought of us because the scripture and if you don't believe me you said well the scripture point that pointed at John that John would come the prophet prophesy that he would come can I read the scripture that he he prophesied of me I read to you the scripture that speaks of me let's go to Ephesians 13 Ephesians 1 [Music] verse3 says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus [Music] [Applause] Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ Hallelujah according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestined us unto the adoption of

be the first to say I recognize I have fallen short of my calling of God is calling me [Music] I know no one's perfect but there's a responsibility calling every one of us have a responsibility here it's sad as us as youth I'm the [Music] first we haven't had enough courage we have been cowards for many for a long time we have fear of what we're going to leave behind a sister a young [Music] man our fleshly [Music] desires but it was through the holy spirit that John was able to do what he did he made his decision when he didn't go I'm a witness of that and one can allow for God to come into his heart it's not one it's not yourself it's God doing it for you youth if you want that and it's not an emotion [Music] be real with yourself be real with God and when that happens God will be real with you in your [Music] life [Music] thee I don't think so the way I [Music] live see it because the way you are here we're going to be over there you're you're going to take nothing only your character so worship like you worship over there you're at home if you want to be you want to be crazy be crazy no one's going to judge you I'm the first one I'm the first crazy one here in this church come on now oh yes [Music] sir and I will celebrate sing unto the Lord I will sing to him a new song and will celebrate sing unto my God I come on now church and I I will praise and I will sing to him a new song tonight and I will I will praise him my God and I I will to him [Music] [Music] onight I [Music] yes [Music] sir F this ain't nothing new this is what we were made for to [Applause] I from yes sir [Music] seated Brothers am we give thanks to God for the word I we give thanks to for God to the word God is good amen I believe we can learn something from John is that there's nothing greater than serving God there's nothing greater than serving God he gave his whole life for the service of God even if God only used him for a couple months his whole life he was preparing himself his whole life he was preparing so God could use him a couple months hallelujah what does that let us [Music] know there's nothing greater than being used by God has to prepare us our whole life prepare our whole life God needs to prepare our whole life to use us just a few months our life was worth it our life was worth it to serve God know John it doesn't register that God talked to John until he saw the dove God spoke to the father of John he didn't even speak to John John had to believe what his father told him was Zachariah and Elizabeth told to John had such a great impact that he dedicated his whole life to prepare himself for what God wanted to do with him there's nothing greater than being used used by God I put I start to think I'm thinking when John was in jail or in [Music] prison and he sends his disciples to ask the Lord Jesus Christ are you or are we waiting for another one ju John the Baptist send his two disciples to ask him Jesus John says John is asking us he's asking for us to ask you is he you or waiting for another one I was meditating on that and there are many opinions around that but what I was thinking John wanted to make sure that he had done his job he wanted to make sure Lord is it you or do I have to keep on talking about you do I have to continue my Ministry continue to Preparing the way is it you Lord or do I have to keep working I can imagine John in the last moments of his life wanting to make sure that he did his job what God called him to do do is it you Lord did I do what I needed to do did I finish what I needed to finish because if it is you I leave in peace because that's why you called me that's why I was born for that's why I came to this earth that's why I came to this earth to introduce the Messiah I have to make sure that I did my job he believed so and he believed so much that he was the precursor of the Messiah the Forerunner of the Messiah what a great man brothers that's what made John so great that's what makes you so great he didn't Point him to himself he knew his whole life he had to prepare himself to point to someone else to point to someone else that's what made him great he was not worried on putting attention on himself but his whole preparation introduce the Lord Jesus Christ and he wanted to make sure in the fin in his final days I do my job come on church is there's someone here that wants to make sure do what God called me to do God gave John a message that brought Heaven to Earth that brought Heaven to Earth God has given us a message to us to us that will bring Christ back to Earth I'll repeat it again God has given us a message back to Earth I make you this question make yourself this question Lord why have you brought me to this earth what is my part in all this called me to do am I doing what you called me to do doesn't that pierce your heart that you can die tomorrow that does desire not come to your heart to say that if I die did I do what God called me to do did I fulfill what God for what God brought me to the Earth this Earth for when I see John like that see as confused prophet in the end I see him as a man who knew what he was here for and if he didn't finish the job he knew he had to continue it but when he heard I am the blind see the mirac tell them that everything's okay he has done what I told him to do he did it well that he did what he came to do there is nothing greater used by God God has called you to do satis that brings you more satisfaction there's nothing that brings you more peace will leave that you leave you more happy than to say Lord I gave my life for you I gave everything for you I finished the job I fulfilled what you brought me to do there's nothing greater maybe John can tell you youth it was six months that God used me it was a few months that God used me but it was the best months of my life what a man what a man what if God is preparing you in these last days when the most beautiful time on Earth will come when he comes for his bride what if if he's called you for that I make you the question what if God called you to use you for that coming there's nothing greater than being used by God I believe John I can see John when those two disciples came back I believe he took a deep breath I said I'm ready Lord I'm ready I'm ready to go thank you for allowing me to leave these these times with you and do this great work for you wouldn't you like to leave this earth like that church youth God is calling you to use you wouldn't you like to leave this earth knowing I did what you called me to do I believed you I stood up for you and I knew what I had to do how John [Music] Liv since he was born since before he was born and since he was born his whole purpose was to introduce the Messiah he gave he gave everything for that he didn't get married he didn't have children he didn't have a family he gave it off so God could use him for six months so God could use him for a couple months how happy he could have left said I did what you called me to do I fulfilled my calling father how happy he could have left I don't believe he left sad I don't believe if I would have made my life different youth if you would know if you knew the happiness that comes and doing what God has called you to do nothing can that we can say the holy spirit is here I believe the holy spirit is here why the holy spirit is here is there someone is there one person who can say Lord use my life my life it can be just for a moment use my life Lord as you want to use me Lord I am here help me to believe in you as that man said but help me with my [Music] unbelief he called you to use you to use you to use [Music] you didn't call me to be in just part of the [Music] crowd you called me to be something great for you no we have to be dismissed but I believe there's someone here who wants to make that [Music] [Music] decision oh [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] see [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] Tois oh [Music] Hallelujah [Music] for [Music] oh for [Music] oh get without without Pres [Music] h [Music] h [Music] h [Music] John showed [Music] us that Miracles are not needed to make Miracles John showed [Music] us we don't need Great Signs to bring the light John showed us we don't need great gifts to serve God [Music] no Miracles register that he did not a gift other than being a [Music] prophet but he demonstrates to you as you are he can use [Music] you to love him with all your [Music] heart and believe him with all your [Music] heart [Music] we're going to be [Music]
