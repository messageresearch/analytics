[14:48] this evening is separated from the world
[14:55] you can go to First of Kings chapter 3
[14:59] verse one we're gonna start there
[15:03] I hope we are ready to learn some facts
[15:05] tonight
[15:10] I found some interesting things about
[15:14] solomonas
[15:16] and I'm going to save the best for last
[15:21] because I didn't even know this either
[15:26] to me yesterday
[15:28] but first Kings three one reads
[15:33] [Music]
[15:35] and Solomon made Affinity with Pharaoh
[15:38] king of Egypt and took Pharaoh's
[15:40] daughter and brought her into the city
[15:42] of David and so he had made an ending of
[15:45] building his own house and the house of
[15:47] the Lord and the wall of Jerusalem
[15:49] roundabout salomoni so foreign
[16:18] second Corinthians 6 14.
[16:24] and when you have a can you say amen
[16:28] and God's word says
[16:32] unequally yoked together with
[16:34] unbelievers
[16:40] for what Fellowship hath righteousness
[16:43] with unrighteousness
[16:48] and what communion has light with
[16:50] Darkness
[16:54] let's make a quick prayer brother
[16:59] Lord heavenly father thank you for this
[17:02] hour Lord
[17:04] how are you prepared to speak your word
[17:07] Lord is
[17:10] bless our hearts and our ears
[17:16] with your wisdom father
[17:18] and with your Revelation Lord Revelation
[17:22] and Lord anything that is out of its
[17:25] place
[17:27] put it in its place
[17:34] and help my brother Sammy and my brother
[17:37] Alex as well
[17:40] help the audience
[17:43] presents in the name Lord Jesus Christ
[17:48] amen amen you may be seated
[17:53] we're still on the character of Solomons
[17:58] and they told me I had extra time
[18:01] tonight
[18:05] I usually bring more more things than I
[18:09] should
[18:10] say and this time I brought a smaller
[18:14] message
[18:17] I also brought something up my sleeve if
[18:21] we can say like that
[18:23] [Music]
[18:26] foreign it's just so we get to know
[18:28] Solomon keep knowing him
[18:32] some things that Solomon is known for
[18:36] Salomon is for his wisdom
[18:39] he was the wisest man on the planet
[18:44] Solomon ruled for 40 years
[18:48] and that was Israel's Golden Age
[18:54] Israel who is at the peak of its power
[18:57] is
[19:00] Solomon was the third king of Israel
[19:05] 20 years old I found out
[19:09] and he died right before 60 or at 16.
[19:16] and I was studying of all his
[19:18] possessions
[19:22] and approximately today in today's
[19:25] economy
[19:31] Solomon would have had an excess
[19:38] of two trilliones
[19:43] two trillion those three units a Fortune
[19:47] of two trillion dollars
[19:49] we I mean we get excited over one
[19:52] million
[19:55] I'll never see a million
[19:59] um
[20:02] but Solomon could have pero Salomon
[20:06] 2
[20:08] trilliones it was a very wealthy man the
[20:12] most wealthy man
[20:15] Salman built the first temple as we all
[20:18] know
[20:20] he has 700 wives as they told us last
[20:24] Friday
[20:29] including the daughter of pharaoh
[20:33] included
[20:34] he didn't have enough with 700.
[20:39] so he wanted a princess
[20:43] amen amen Solomon's sin who knows what
[20:46] Solomon's sin was
[20:49] if you read ahead Solomon's sin was
[20:52] worshiping idols
[20:57] and
[21:07] foreign's Kingdom today
[21:12] he would have his kingdom would have
[21:14] been from Israel
[21:18] Jordan Jordan Palestine Palestina and
[21:24] Syria is Syria that's that would have
[21:26] made a big country
[21:30] so just these are just some facts
[21:35] they told me I had extra time so I
[21:37] wanted to share that with you
[21:40] well back to our scripture
[22:05] they wanted to avoid war there
[22:10] Solomon's borders uh
[22:18] I imagine he wanted peace with Egypt
[22:23] so he marries Pharaoh's daughter
[22:29] and this is where I want to say yes
[22:34] where II Corinthians say look it is
[22:38] be not equally yoked together with
[22:41] unbelievers
[22:46] communion communion light with Darkness
[22:48] yeah
[22:55] personally
[22:58] I get excited about this
[23:01] I don't know why but sometimes when you
[23:05] say something and you lived it
[23:09] it's different amen
[23:12] there's like substance behind it
[23:15] translator so I can say I've been in
[23:18] Solomon's feet
[23:21] or Solomon's been in my steps
[23:27] but as a Christian
[23:29] talking to the youth here
[23:32] knowing that they want to court
[23:38] we all grow up eventually right
[23:43] amen and I just want to give the advice
[23:47] as plain as it can be
[23:51] we have no business
[23:58] but what is an unequal
[24:02] I remember our brother vidad made this
[24:05] reference
[24:08] and a yolk is the idea of two bulls
[24:37] or the other is not even pulling at all
[24:41] you see they are unable to plow in a
[24:45] straight line
[24:47] capacitados
[24:50] and this that's what happens when one
[24:53] follows Christ yes
[24:56] and the other does not
[25:00] are you following me
[25:02] that's what happens
[25:05] I don't know why but lately I I I don't
[25:08] want to stay home lately
[25:13] last year I wanted to stay home
[25:17] but I would still come to church
[25:20] but this year I call like a second wind
[25:28] and now I I just want to be responsible
[25:32] here
[25:35] and that's that's what I want to say
[25:38] that you should be in church
[25:42] and not one at home
[25:46] I understand if there's a health issue
[25:50] but we should walk in a straight line
[25:53] together
[25:53] [Music]
[25:56] especially us that are married
[26:08] God has beautiful sisters
[26:13] God has beautiful daughters
[26:17] and God has beautiful sons
[26:21] amen amen and
[26:24] God has put us together
[26:28] to not look for business out there
[26:33] as Solomon did
[26:35] it says in the message separation from
[26:38] unbelief
[26:43] it says don't yoke yourself up among
[26:46] Believers
[26:52] says many places of the scripture
[26:55] teaches us that we should separate
[26:57] ourselves
[27:02] the first thing that God required
[27:04] Abraham to do when he called him
[27:11] was to separate himself
[27:16] from his people his Kindred and he'd
[27:19] bless him
[27:23] says the holy spirit separates us from
[27:26] the things of the world
[27:30] from the cares of this world
[27:32] [Music]
[27:35] affection set on Christ Jesus
[27:39] Jesus now brother Brandon is speaking
[27:43] about Solomon and Ahab here now
[27:46] [Music]
[27:49] but he says you know the wisest man in
[27:53] the Bible outside of Christ Alone
[27:58] died a healing idolater
[28:02] un incredulo
[28:05] the wisest man in the Bible
[28:09] outside of Christ
[28:13] the second wisest man
[28:17] died
[28:19] [Music]
[28:21] because of a bunch of I'll say it here
[28:25] because of a bunch of Pretty Woman
[28:31] all right
[28:33] I don't know how to say this
[28:35] I don't want to offend anybody
[28:38] especially the ones watching on the
[28:40] internet
[28:42] but pretty women
[28:46] drive us mad
[28:51] I must be preaching to only women
[28:55] pretty women brother
[29:01] they drive us mad
[29:03] you know especially
[29:07] if you're not subjects
[29:10] to the Holy Spirit
[29:16] Solomon pulled away from God
[29:24] Isaac pulled away from God
[29:29] for pretty woman
[29:32] you're you are you guys already saw what
[29:36] I went through
[29:38] for a pretty woman
[29:41] but thanks to God
[29:44] those that love God
[29:47] all things help them for good
[29:51] all things
[29:53] with every trial
[29:57] God will provide the way of Escape
[30:02] it might not be the most prettiest way
[30:07] but it's the way of Escape
[30:11] it might be ugly
[30:14] but appreciate it
[30:16] that it's a way of Escape
[30:19] brother Brandon
[30:23] and I've seen many people come to the
[30:25] platform
[30:28] and be healed and walk away
[30:32] and mix up with unbelievers
[30:37] and their sickness comes right back to
[30:40] them again
[30:43] I've been there brother I don't want to
[30:46] put you on the spot
[30:49] forgive me but I've been here
[30:52] I've been here being prayed for just
[30:56] and then I've went with unbelievers
[31:02] there might be a uh argument there
[31:06] argument but you know some people might
[31:09] say well Jesus was with Sinners
[31:14] they call Jesus a sinner's friend
[31:20] here
[31:22] people come and be prayed to be healed
[31:27] and they go back into the world
[31:30] like if it didn't matter that God healed
[31:35] they didn't keep up with that healing
[31:40] it says in First Kings 11 this is
[31:45] I'll be reading a few verses
[31:48] we're going to speak on the downfall of
[31:51] Solomon Williams
[31:54] First Kings 11 1.
[31:59] but King Solomon loved many strange
[32:02] women together with the daughter of
[32:03] pharaoh woman of the moabites ammonites
[32:25] of the Nations concerning which the Lord
[32:27] said unto the children of Israel
[32:32] go on no
[32:35] verse 2 verse 2 they say
[32:38] um
[32:39] Israel
[32:44] ye shall not go into them
[32:48] neither shall they come in unto you
[32:52] for surely they will turn away your
[32:55] heart after their gods
[33:02] pretty woman out there
[33:05] they're gonna turn your hearts
[33:09] away from God Alejandro now sisters
[33:15] handsome boys
[33:17] are gonna turn your hearts
[33:21] away from God
[33:25] unless they have the Holy Spirit
[33:31] that's I remember our pastor preached uh
[33:34] some tips if you're looking for a
[33:36] partner like two three years ago
[34:01] ouch
[34:07] Amen brother let's break the tension
[34:12] uh continues reading
[34:16] uh verse 10 years
[34:21] uh forgive me verse 9.
[34:25] and the Lord was angry with Solomon
[34:28] because his heart was turned from the
[34:29] Lord God of Israel is
[34:37] which had appeared unto him twice
[34:41] and had commanded him concerning this
[34:44] thing
[34:48] that he should not go after other gods
[34:55] but
[34:57] he kept not that which the Lord
[34:59] commanded
[35:02] now there are consequences brother
[35:05] and here's the consequence
[35:08] wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon
[36:05] because we can have friendships here
[36:08] amen
[36:09] as long as we're in the steps amen but
[36:15] for Pretty Woman
[36:19] muchachas Bonitas because we love
[36:23] beautiful women Solomon went and
[36:25] worshiped their gods
[36:29] because he loved the woman
[36:32] he didn't even love those Gods
[36:36] he loves the woman
[36:39] and that's why he worshiped those Gods
[36:44] but closing now I'd like to focus on why
[36:48] David and Solomon had so many wives
[36:55] have you ever asked yourself
[37:01] it says in the message choosing of a
[37:03] bride
[37:07] notice that we are all in individual
[37:10] bride note
[37:13] making up the bride haciendo a la Novia
[37:17] this might be for the more advanced
[37:20] Brothers
[37:23] says the word says that she was made for
[37:26] man and not made not man-made for her
[37:29] this is
[37:35] she was made for man
[37:40] if I was a woman
[37:42] I was made for man
[37:46] and not man made for her
[37:51] says now I'm going to speak on why in a
[37:54] few minutes on the bride of Christ
[37:58] what I'm trying to show you the
[38:00] background of it
[38:04] says that's the reason under the Old Law
[38:07] was that polygamy was legal yes
[38:14] now listen
[38:16] look at David sitting down there with
[38:19] 500 wives
[38:24] and the Bible said he was man after
[38:26] God's Own Hearts
[38:30] it was 500 wives
[38:33] and Solomon with a thousand
[38:37] but not one of them women
[39:00] now we cannot serve two masters
[39:05] we'll leave one wrong
[39:10] but it says
[39:13] the whole 500 woman was just David's
[39:17] wife
[39:23] now turn your spiritual hearing on
[39:27] spiritual it was a type when Christ sits
[39:31] on the throne in the millennium
[39:41] his bride will not be one
[39:44] persona but it'll be tens of thousands
[39:52] The Pride all-in-one
[39:57] and David had many wives as individuals
[40:03] all of them together was his wife
[40:07] like the whole body of Believers is the
[40:11] bride of Christ
[40:13] is
[40:20] he was the man
[40:23] now right here
[40:26] we were made for Christ
[40:30] we were made for
[40:34] Christo Christ
[40:37] o wasn't
[40:39] made for me
[40:44] we should do some reading
[40:47] but
[40:49] Christo the prophet says wasn't made for
[40:53] me
[40:55] I was made for Christ
[41:01] that's why we tried to do today in our
[41:04] textbooks
[41:09] is to try to make the word which is
[41:12] Christ
[41:31] that's the difference he says
[41:34] instead of us shooting the world
[41:41] it says please say I'll read it to you
[41:44] again
[41:46] which is Christ suit us
[41:51] to suit us
[41:55] it says again
[41:58] because
[41:59] [Music]
[42:04] we were made for Christo
[42:09] this is uh this is maybe it might be too
[42:13] advanced
[42:15] but Dave all of David's wives for the
[42:18] Youth
[42:21] and Solomon's wives
[42:24] they were all just his one wife
[42:30] just like when the Lord sits on the
[42:33] throne
[42:36] he will have tens of thousands
[42:40] but one bride pero una Novia and that's
[42:44] it for tonight Brothers God bless you
[42:46] yes
[42:48] [Applause]
[42:52] amen God bless you since
[42:56] the Lord tonight
[43:05] how many are happy to be in the house of
[43:07] the almighty God
[43:11] amen
[43:12] I'm so happy to see each and every one
[43:14] of you
[43:15] hey man right away if you could please
[43:17] stand
[43:18] if you could please open your Bibles
[43:21] to Proverbs chapter 3 verse 13 and 15.
[43:27] when you have me please
[43:39] and it says like this they say I see
[43:42] happy is the man that findeth wisdom and
[43:45] the man that Gareth understanding
[43:56] and the game thereof then fine gold
[44:05] Fino
[44:07] Treasures than rubies and all the things
[44:09] that can't desire are not to be compared
[44:12] unto her Mas precious
[44:17] Italian
[44:21] amen Brothers
[44:28] separation from the world
[44:31] you know I think that's a requirement
[44:34] that we need Brothers
[44:36] to be separated from this world
[44:41] you see because if we're not separated
[44:44] you see God can't use us
[44:48] but it takes a separation
[44:52] amen Brothers this night we are focusing
[44:55] on the Bible character King Solomon says
[45:01] here tonight
[45:03] you know many of us all think
[45:07] that we know the whole story of King
[45:09] Solomon
[45:10] [Music]
[45:11] but in reality Brothers we only know the
[45:15] most outstanding things
[45:18] about the life of Solomon
[45:21] like his wisdom
[45:23] but there is a lot more
[45:26] of King Solomon's story
[45:30] that we have to understand
[45:33] who was Solomon you see Solomon was the
[45:37] second son of King David
[45:41] because the first son
[45:44] that David had was with
[45:50] hair
[46:31] that David did not take account of that
[46:34] sin
[46:36] so David tried to cover it says
[46:43] I'm sorry it was by and wise and selfish
[46:46] decisions
[46:53] and you know meditating about this
[46:55] Brothers
[46:56] you know thinking about this throughout
[46:58] the week
[47:00] no there are three things that can sink
[47:08] if I could put it in order tonight
[47:14] number two
[47:20] you see these are the three things
[47:23] that can seek the men of God
[47:27] and here we have a great example
[47:30] we have King Solomon
[47:33] Solomon was a very humble man
[47:37] Solomon was a very simple man
[47:41] Solomon loved the god of Israel
[47:44] you see the Bible shows us
[47:47] that God appeared to Solomon
[47:51] two times God appeared to Solomon twice
[47:56] and in two occasions God spoke with him
[48:01] the first conversation
[48:05] can be seen in first the Kings chapter 3
[48:08] verse 5.
[48:11] and it says like this is
[48:14] the Lord appeared to Solomon in a Dream
[48:16] by night they say
[48:19] David
[48:37] are you in I'm sorry verse 6.
[48:44] this is
[48:52] amen Brothers water and expression
[48:56] King Solomon was making to his father
[48:59] David
[49:03] you see how beautiful it would be que
[49:06] Hermos
[49:08] could express those words of their
[49:10] fathers
[49:14] let's continue reading
[49:17] according as he walked before there in
[49:19] truth
[49:21] and in righteousness and
[49:29] thou has kept for him this great
[49:31] kindness
[49:34] has given him a son to sit on his throne
[49:40] as it is
[49:44] reading verse 9. give therefore thy
[49:48] servant and understanding Hearts
[49:53] to judge thy people
[49:56] that I may discern between good and bad
[50:01] for who is able to judge this
[50:05] thy so greater people
[50:09] amen what a request
[50:13] um
[50:49] and
[50:52] the reason when Solomon the son of David
[50:55] when he took the throne
[51:01] well he never prayed that God would give
[51:03] him so much
[51:06] but just wisdom to know how to govern
[51:09] and hold the people together
[51:13] well now God worked with him
[51:17] and he gave him a gift of discernment
[51:21] true certainly did
[51:24] and he could discern the right from
[51:27] wrong
[51:30] and so forth and the News scattered
[51:32] everywhere
[51:36] throughout all the world of this Grace
[51:39] you see there was no person
[51:42] there was no King there was no one who
[51:48] had more wisdom
[51:50] who had more wealth
[51:53] we had more knowledge
[51:55] then King Solomon
[51:58] you see all of Israel
[52:01] was subjected subjected
[52:08] and the wisdom of King Solomon
[52:11] spread throughout the whole world
[52:15] you see everything Solomon did
[52:18] was done with all the wisdom foreign
[53:14] players Which chapter two I mean not
[53:17] chapter nine Capitol verse two to seven
[53:20] we could see that God speaks for the
[53:23] second time
[53:27] and the Lord appeared to Solomon for the
[53:30] second time
[53:33] as he had appeared unto him
[53:36] and the Lord said unto him
[53:40] I have heard thy prayer
[53:43] and thy supplication
[53:46] that thou Hast made before me
[53:49] I have allowed this house
[53:53] which thou has built
[53:56] to put my name there forever and mine
[53:59] eyes and Mine Heart shall be there
[54:01] perpetually yes
[54:28] and we'll keep my statues and my
[54:31] judgments
[54:33] then I will establish the Throne of thy
[54:36] kingdom upon Israel forever
[54:42] as I promised to David thy father
[54:46] saying there shall not fail the other
[54:48] yes upon the throne of Israel
[55:00] you see David was a king of War
[55:05] you see David had to fought for his land
[55:08] how to fight for everything
[55:12] was the king of peace
[55:15] and while David prepared everything
[55:22] Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem
[55:24] [Music]
[55:26] but listen here Brothers
[55:29] it says in here in chapter six
[55:32] but if ye shall at all turn from
[55:35] following me oops
[55:43] and will not keep thy Commandments and
[55:46] my statues which I have set before you
[55:48] know
[55:52] go and serve other
[55:55] godses
[56:04] and this house
[56:06] which I have allowed for my name is
[56:13] and Israel shall be a proverb and a
[56:16] byword among all people Israel
[56:28] you see God promised him that not only
[56:32] will he give him the wisdom and
[56:34] knowledge
[56:36] of right and wrong
[56:39] we also promised him wealth and riches
[56:43] you see in the days of Solomon
[56:46] the scripture shows that he carried that
[56:48] he carried ships
[56:55] that were imported to him
[56:59] that carried thousands of kilos of gold
[57:02] and
[57:03] Silvers
[57:07] you see the scripture says that Solomon
[57:11] received about 25 tons
[57:18] or 50 000 pounds materialistic
[57:40] materialista gracias that the Bible says
[57:43] now Solomon enforced the people
[57:47] to pay heavy taxes
[57:51] just for the construction of the temple
[57:55] you see but this wasn't this wasn't all
[57:58] in uh Solomon's downfall
[58:00] era
[58:03] you see Solomon's downfall
[58:06] was in idolatry and women
[58:11] amen Brothers the Bible shows us that
[58:16] Solomon had 700 wives
[58:19] and 300 concubines
[58:23] imagine that Brothers
[58:25] if I could see Brothers here they could
[58:27] barely last with one aquilos Hermanos
[58:30] just imagine Solomon with 1 000.
[58:35] amen Brothers but eventually as time El
[58:48] and their hearts turned from God
[58:53] you see and eventually
[58:57] Solomon's heart was turned away from God
[58:59] too
[59:02] you see although Solomon
[59:05] knew what was right from wrong
[59:09] his wife still somehow convinced this
[59:14] to build high places
[59:20] could worship their Pagan deities
[59:26] and that resulted in yes
[59:32] you see but at some point Brothers
[59:40] you see Solomon was tired of the wealth
[59:44] you see Solomon was part of the success
[59:48] foreign
[1:00:58] are given to the sons of man to be
[1:01:01] exercised there with
[1:01:05] verse 14 I have seen all the words
[1:01:09] that are done under the sun
[1:01:13] and behold all is Vanity
[1:01:18] vexation of spirits
[1:01:21] you see this caught my attention
[1:01:24] because with Solomon
[1:01:27] with all that he had
[1:01:29] all that wealth imagine our brother
[1:01:33] Isaac said it himself
[1:01:35] two trillion dollars
[1:02:35] he felt sure of himself
[1:02:38] this is what happens Brothers
[1:02:41] with the majority of people
[1:02:44] who maybe have achieved wealth
[1:02:48] Fame and success
[1:02:52] they try to find satisfaction
[1:02:56] through pleasure
[1:03:00] material possessions
[1:03:03] materials through their pride
[1:03:06] and fame ifama understanding this
[1:03:10] Brothers
[1:03:11] the problem that we have
[1:03:14] is that we are always looking for
[1:03:17] something
[1:03:19] that satisfies us
[1:03:21] we always want to try to achieve
[1:03:24] something
[1:03:25] to feel like we are somebody big foreign
[1:03:47] everything is
[1:03:50] you see we will not find satisfaction
[1:03:54] in the things of this world
[1:03:57] this thing only has temporary things
[1:04:00] you see Brothers
[1:04:03] Solomon was part of the things he did
[1:04:05] Under the Sun
[1:04:09] I like that expression Under the Sun
[1:04:13] and sometimes we are living a life Under
[1:04:16] the Sun
[1:04:18] you see and Under the Sun we are living
[1:04:21] a life of Cycles
[1:04:24] we come to church three times a week
[1:04:27] we come to church and sit down
[1:04:30] we all we aren't satisfied with what we
[1:04:33] heard
[1:04:35] we are satisfied with the music
[1:04:38] so we just make it a habit
[1:04:41] or a routine and leave church
[1:04:46] the same way we came
[1:04:49] but brother sometimes something we fit
[1:04:52] we fail to realize
[1:04:55] where we are right now
[1:04:58] all of this Brothers
[1:05:00] here is eternal life
[1:05:04] and we cannot lose it
[1:05:06] because we are living in a time
[1:05:10] where we are under the sun
[1:05:13] you see you we have a purpose in this
[1:05:15] world
[1:05:17] we have a purpose in which why we are
[1:05:20] here
[1:05:22] but sometimes we misread our purposes
[1:05:27] because if all that we want to do
[1:05:32] is save money is
[1:05:38] and educate ourselves
[1:05:40] and be bigger than others
[1:05:45] but we will take we will have we will
[1:05:47] take quite a time to find our purpose
[1:05:56] whether that means riches or fame
[1:06:00] they will never find it
[1:06:02] you see both the wise and foolish
[1:06:07] um
[1:06:10] will eventually die
[1:06:14] wisdom wealth and fame
[1:06:18] or temporary and they will be forgotten
[1:06:23] but here is eternal life
[1:06:26] here is something Eternal
[1:06:30] you see the problem with Solomon is
[1:06:33] a Solomon had pride in his heart
[1:06:43] pride is the one of the reasons
[1:06:47] why there are problems in homes
[1:06:51] relationships
[1:06:53] and families you see brother Branham
[1:06:56] says
[1:06:58] that this is happening in churches too
[1:07:00] is
[1:07:03] Brides in churches
[1:07:05] the churches all across the country
[1:07:08] you see look at all these denominational
[1:07:11] churches
[1:07:12] they are pastors
[1:07:17] and that Pride themselves
[1:07:20] and having big churches
[1:07:23] big audiences
[1:07:26] having the best musicians
[1:07:29] having the best preachers you see the
[1:07:33] brothers the prophet says
[1:07:35] you see that's words of curing to all
[1:07:38] the churches around the globe
[1:07:40] there are churches
[1:07:42] they have preachers
[1:07:45] that stand in speed
[1:07:48] about little things
[1:07:51] without any importance in reality
[1:07:56] instead of preaching repentance to the
[1:07:59] people
[1:08:01] and bringing men and women to the altar
[1:08:06] look at what these denominational people
[1:08:08] are doing
[1:08:10] they don't want to preach about
[1:08:12] repentance
[1:08:14] they do not want to tell the sisters
[1:08:17] how to dress like a true lady
[1:08:29] because these people
[1:08:31] what they want to preach
[1:08:34] it's something just to satisfy
[1:08:36] themselves
[1:08:38] the majority of denominations
[1:08:43] have left the the and the hell
[1:08:47] to build according to the thoughts of
[1:08:49] man
[1:08:53] and what these people do now
[1:08:56] they preach prosperity
[1:08:59] and a message
[1:09:01] of make me feel good
[1:09:06] but I give thanks to God
[1:09:08] for the messenger that he has given
[1:09:11] usage
[1:09:12] because I believe that the greatest
[1:09:15] thing
[1:09:16] that somebody could have
[1:09:19] is God in their hearts
[1:09:22] I believe that it shouldn't be important
[1:09:26] how good of a musician
[1:09:31] how good of a Preacher
[1:09:36] how good you are at certain things
[1:09:40] you see but the most important thing is
[1:09:43] to have Christ in our lives
[1:09:50] that makes a difference in this world
[1:09:53] but it takes separation
[1:09:57] it says a separation from this world
[1:10:00] so that we may live a life
[1:10:03] that pleases God
[1:10:06] you see because because without him we
[1:10:10] wouldn't be here right now you see
[1:10:12] Brothers we have maintained this church
[1:10:16] Voice of Truth
[1:10:19] for over 10 years
[1:10:22] supporting you with our offerings
[1:10:27] and sales
[1:10:29] but it is by God's grace
[1:10:33] that the church is still standing
[1:10:36] Brothers
[1:10:37] it's by God's grace
[1:10:39] that we are still here
[1:10:42] you see God has been merciful to us
[1:11:04] we are still here by his grace
[1:11:08] and why not give him thanks tonight
[1:11:11] I want to read a quote by Brother
[1:11:13] Branham
[1:11:15] if the musicians may please pass
[1:11:18] and it says like this
[1:11:21] the king got to a place that he thought
[1:11:23] within himself
[1:11:27] that he got lifted up
[1:11:30] cried God in his heart
[1:11:33] and that's what's happened to us
[1:11:36] if you're part in this expression
[1:11:39] but that's what's happened to our
[1:11:41] churches throughout the country
[1:11:43] they're fine people in there
[1:11:46] some of the best in the world goes to
[1:11:49] church
[1:11:49] I think the best in the world goes to
[1:11:52] church
[1:11:53] but the thing of it is
[1:11:56] the organization system gets lifted up
[1:12:02] and that's what's happened to the
[1:12:04] Methodist
[1:12:06] that's what has happened to the Baptist
[1:12:09] that's what happened to the Nazarene
[1:12:12] to the pilgrim Holiness
[1:12:16] to the Pentecostals
[1:12:21] little self-willed
[1:12:24] self-willed and self-centered upstairs
[1:12:28] try that you can't tell nothing to
[1:12:33] God can't find a way to get in their
[1:12:35] hearts
[1:12:37] it's because they become so know it all
[1:12:42] that nobody can tell them anything
[1:12:45] and by building themselves around
[1:12:48] reasoning with Brethren foreign
[1:13:37] got lifted up
[1:13:38] if you may please stand Brothers
[1:13:42] Solomon fell in love with the material
[1:13:44] things
[1:13:47] you see Solomon was so self-centered
[1:13:50] Salomon era
[1:13:53] centrico rather than Christ Center
[1:13:56] Cristo centrico his obsessions with his
[1:13:59] own words
[1:14:02] let him to ignore his desperate
[1:14:04] desperate need for something
[1:14:10] you see what he needed was the blood of
[1:14:14] Jesus Christ
[1:14:15] and we need the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:14:18] Brothers
[1:14:19] you see we don't need material things
[1:14:22] we don't need the temporary things of
[1:14:24] this world
[1:14:26] we don't need what this flesh desires
[1:14:34] because without it we have nothing
[1:14:37] nothing you see the Bible says that we
[1:14:41] were not Redeemed by the things of this
[1:14:43] world
[1:14:44] but we are Redeemed by his Precious
[1:14:47] Blood
[1:14:49] maybe tonight maybe youth maybe tonight
[1:14:53] we may find ourselves
[1:14:55] with pride in our hearts
[1:14:57] maybe tonight we find ourselves
[1:15:00] not satisfied with what you heard
[1:15:02] tonight
[1:15:04] maybe tonight we feel distant from God
[1:15:08] baby tonight we find ourselves in
[1:15:11] desperation
[1:15:12] but brother Brandon said
[1:15:15] the only way to find God is
[1:15:19] when we take off our pride
[1:16:07] it takes a separation
[1:16:10] so that God can use us
[1:16:13] you see it Brothers he is here tonight
[1:16:16] and if you're looking for Redemption
[1:16:20] he wants to cleanse us Brothers
[1:16:31] meditate with him
[1:16:39] [Music]
[1:16:50] why don't you worshiping tonight
