[54:19] expansion of
[54:20] stars qui and unbroken
[54:23] except for the soft bleeding of sheep
[54:33] foron Life was RM
[54:37] simplicity watching Waiting anding the
[54:41] FL there were men of dust and labor
[54:45] overlooked by the world but not
[54:47] untouched by questions that they be that
[54:53] theye The Silence of the night
[54:57] theirs unp but
[55:00] shared
[55:02] does God see Us here so Far away from
[55:07] the noise and the importance of the
[55:10] Village on this night these men Who
[55:14] thought themselves the least were about
[55:16] to encounter a message so profound it
[55:21] would lift the and illuminate the
[55:23] darkest corners of their hearts
[55:29] you you know Jonah do do you ever Wonder
[55:33] If there's more Life than than I don't
[55:36] know then just tending to these sheep
[55:39] All the time or or Being in the fields
[55:41] all
[55:42] day What are you saying are you saying
[55:45] You're tired of taking care of sheep
[55:47] That's Our That's Our Duty in Life I I I
[55:51] know we're Just sheff but why do I have
[55:53] to go unnoticed or unrecognized for
[55:56] we do for The towns
[55:58] People Maybe Maybe the the Town people
[56:01] look down on Us but I think God sees
[56:03] more in Us than than What we even
[56:06] [Música]
[56:07] see I don't know e It's kind of hard to
[56:11] believe When everyone Under appreciates
[56:13] Us and and look down on Us like as If
[56:16] for
[56:17] Nothing yeah He's right We we're the
[56:22] last people anybody would call on butes
[56:26] Things
[56:26] differently he knows Our lives matters
[56:29] in Ways that they May not
[56:31] see but but when's the last time Any Any
[56:35] FR from the Town has has thought of a
[56:37] Shepherd Worth More Than than than a
[56:39] handful of grain or or the dust off
[56:41] their
[56:42] sandals you know
[56:45] [Música]
[56:46] Maybe Maybe It's like David he he was a
[56:50] shepher but God chose
[56:54] him yeah Jonah You're right God chooses
[56:58] the lowest the people who You wouldn't
[57:00] really
[57:02] choose I don't know but I don't know but
[57:05] you you got me thinking
[57:07] is Maybe There is a Chance or or Maybe
[57:10] Maybe a slight possibility that that
[57:13] Maybe Maybe God sees Us
[57:23] too I don't know but
[57:27] Maybe Maybe there's just a slight Chance
[57:29] that that God sees Us to however small
[57:32] it May
[57:33] be
[57:36] yeah things much differently than we can
[57:39] Ever
[57:43] understand Hey where's your sheep going
[57:46] Come Back Come
[57:48] Back going Where you going what what
[57:52] What's wrong With Your Face Oh

[59:48] not matter and did not seem unworthy in
[59:51] the eyes of God The shepherds Who Had

[1:11:26] [Música]
[1:11:26] [Aplausos]
[1:11:34] [Música]
[1:11:39] pienso que todos en algún
[1:11:40] [Música]
[1:11:42] momento nos hemos sentido
[1:11:46] como olvidados
[1:11:48] [Música]
[1:11:56] mucho tal vez nos comparamos a los
[1:12:00] demás y miramos de que somos muy
[1:12:05] diferentes de que somos muy
[1:12:10] pequeños comparados a
[1:12:13] otros tal vez sentimos de que nadie mira
[1:12:16] lo que
[1:12:20] hacemos pero yo quiero
[1:12:23] decirle aquellos que nos sentimos
[1:12:27] pequeños aquellos que nos sentimos
[1:12:31] olvidados son exactamente las personas
[1:12:34] que Dios está
[1:12:37] buscando para él poderlos
[1:12:40] usar el apóstol Pablo nos
[1:12:43] dice haya Pues en
[1:12:46] vosotros el mismo sentir que hubo en
[1:12:49] Cristo
[1:12:51] Jesús el cual siendo el Dios eterno
[1:12:56] el cual no se aferró a ser igual que
[1:13:01] Dios sino que se despojó de sí
[1:13:05] mismo y se hizo pequeño por
[1:13:10] nosotros y vino a los
[1:13:13] pequeños él todavía es
[1:13:18] pequeño él todavía es
[1:13:21] pequeño él todavía viene a los pequeños
[1:13:25] en una
[1:13:27] ocasión
[1:13:28] Elías se sentía
[1:13:31] pequeño se sentía
[1:13:33] solo y la Biblia nos
[1:13:36] dice que él se fue
[1:13:41] triste quebrantado de
[1:13:44] corazón a una
[1:13:46] cueva y le dijo
[1:13:49] dios Mátame
[1:13:51] mejor mejor má
[1:13:55] todo lo que hago de nada
[1:13:58] sirve y Dios se le
[1:14:01] apareció para
[1:14:04] mostrarle que Dios no obra solamente en
[1:14:07] las cosas
[1:14:10] grandes sino que él obra en las cosas
[1:14:14] pequeñas y le mostró un gran
[1:14:19] terremoto le mostró un gran
[1:14:22] viento y le mostró un gran fuego
[1:14:26] y se dio cuenta de que Dios no estaba en
[1:14:29] esas grandes
[1:14:33] cosas pero luego le mostró una pequeña
[1:14:37] suave
[1:14:40] voz pequeña y quieta
[1:14:46] voz y ahí estaba
[1:14:50] Dios Dios Estaba mostrando a el
[1:14:56] yo no solamente obro en las cosas
[1:14:59] grandes yo no me muevo solamente en las
[1:15:02] cosas
[1:15:04] enormes Yo me muevo en las cosas
[1:15:08] pequeñas y Dios
[1:15:10] todavía está
[1:15:13] pequeño y Dios todavía es una voz
[1:15:18] pequeña Dios todavía obra con Los
[1:15:22] pequeños era
[1:15:25] [Música]
[1:15:26] voz quieta y
[1:15:30] pequeña para mostrar de que Dios
[1:15:34] todavía
[1:15:36] permanece
[1:15:39] [Música]
[1:15:41] pequeño todavía
[1:15:44] pequeño diga todavía
[1:15:48] pequeño permanece
[1:15:52] pequeño Yo quiero decirle a cada uno de
[1:15:56] ustedes permanece
[1:16:00] pequeño así como él permanece
[1:16:04] pequeño tú permane
[1:16:07] pequeño yo pudiera decirte todas las
[1:16:10] razones porque eres
[1:16:12] grande yo pudiera decirte de que Dios te
[1:16:15] hizo una persona tan única
[1:16:22] [Música]
[1:16:28] porque Dios esconde sus cosas grandes en
[1:16:31] cosas
[1:16:35] pequeñas dice de que el
[1:16:39] sol es tan grande tan
[1:16:44] enorme pero no hace nada de
[1:16:48] ruido puede sacar miles de galones de
[1:16:51] Agua de la Tierra
[1:16:55] y hacer menos
[1:16:57] ruido que lo que nosotros hacemos cuando
[1:17:01] sacamos un galón de agua de una pompa
[1:17:03] una
[1:17:06] bomba porque Dios esconde las cosas
[1:17:11] grandes dentro de cosas
[1:17:14] pequeñas por eso Dios te hizo
[1:17:19] pequeñ por eso dios busca los peños
[1:17:24] dice permanece
[1:17:28] pequeño Oh es fácil creernos algo
[1:17:32] grande y pudiéramos hablar de Por qué
[1:17:35] somos gente
[1:17:36] grande delante de los ojos de Dios pero
[1:17:40] Dios no quiere
[1:17:41] Eso Dios quiere personas
[1:17:45] pequeñas yo me estaba recordando de mi
[1:17:48] propia
[1:17:50] vida cuando iba
[1:17:53] creciendo siempre era el
[1:17:56] raro verdaderamente yo era el
[1:18:00] raro no me juntaba con
[1:18:03] nadie todos tenían ropa
[1:18:06] bonita zapatos
[1:18:09] bonitos todos tenían buenas
[1:18:12] cosas para Navidad recibían grandes
[1:18:17] regalos yo recibía lo que agarraban allá
[1:18:20] en el lugar de donación
[1:18:26] Toa me recuerdo caminar a la escuela con
[1:18:28] zapatos
[1:18:31] rotos un suer siempre me cubría la
[1:18:33] cabeza con un
[1:18:39] Hood iba era
[1:18:44] raro y eso me enseñó una gran
[1:18:47] lección entre más pequeños podemos
[1:18:51] ser más Dios nos puede usar
[1:18:57] permanece
[1:18:59] pequeño es lo que Dios siempre me ha
[1:19:01] dicho a mi
[1:19:03] corazón Eso es lo que Dios siempre me ha
[1:19:07] recordado Tito No te creas
[1:19:11] nadie No te creas que eres
[1:19:15] importante
[1:19:17] recuerda entre más pequeño tú te puedas
[1:19:21] hacer más yo puedo usarte
[1:19:25] no busques
[1:19:27] títulos no busques grandes cosas en esta
[1:19:31] tierra si puedes ser más
[1:19:34] sencillo yo puedo manifestar en tu
[1:19:43] vida a

[1:20:00] fallas a ve me gusta ni
[1:20:05] presentarme la gente dice se presenta ni
[1:20:09] saluda

[1:20:26] no busques un lugar
[1:20:30] importante en el momento que tú te creas
[1:20:35] importante Dios te va a quitar
[1:20:40] todo y yo te digo
[1:20:43] iglesia yo te digo a ti si eres un
[1:20:47] es tal vez eres el
[1:20:50] raro Tal vez Dios te dio un aguijón
[1:20:56] como el apóstol
[1:20:59] Pablo él podía haberse creído el más
[1:21:02] grande de
[1:21:05] todos él podría haber sido el más grande
[1:21:08] de
[1:21:11] todos él tenía más revelación que todos
[1:21:13] los
[1:21:15] apóstoles Pero él dijo para que yo no me
[1:21:20] engrandezca para que yo no me crea
[1:21:22] alguien grande
[1:21:24] me dio un
[1:21:26] aguijón para mantenerme
[1:21:30] pequeño lo
[1:21:33] segó lo tumbó del
[1:21:35] caballo Oh iglesia si pudiéramos
[1:21:39] bajarnos de nuestro
[1:21:43] caballo suficiente
[1:21:46] tiempo para que él pueda
[1:21:50] ayudarnos la razón que no nos puede
[1:21:52] ayudar
[1:21:54] que estamos en nuestro caballo
[1:21:57] todava nos creemos
[1:22:00] algo no te das
[1:22:02] cuenta Eso lo que Dios no
[1:22:08] quiere Él está buscando
[1:22:12] alguien que se sienta
[1:22:18] pequeño yal vez Dios te dio a ti un
[1:22:23] aguijón algunos
[1:22:26] aquí no pueden hablar

[1:22:51] algo raro
[1:22:55] algo que los hace sentirse
[1:22:58] raros el
[1:23:02] nerviosismo tal vez como se
[1:23:07] miran tal vez su cuerpo se siente
[1:23:12] raro vez ustedes se sienten menos que
[1:23:14] los
[1:23:17] demás eso es exactamente lo que Dios
[1:23:19] quiere
[1:23:26] es exactamente lo que Dios
[1:23:27] quiere por eso Dios te hizo
[1:23:32] raro yo me miro
[1:23:35] y miro señor he sido un tartamudo
[1:23:40] señor antes no podía ni
[1:23:42] hablar era tan
[1:23:48] callado y Dios me dijo Esto es lo que
[1:23:51] quiero
[1:23:55] quiero que te siempre recuerdes que eres
[1:24:02] pequeño porque en cuanto tú te creas
[1:24:10] algo Dios no te puede

[1:24:49] para este
[1:24:53] mundo pero yo los voy a hacer
