[25:11] amen amen if you could open your Bibles
[25:13] the Hebrews
[25:17] 4:15 you're going to be getting into the
[25:19] word of the
[25:21] Lord and for our title
[25:24] tonight we have titled it he understands
[25:30] and as a little
[25:32] subtitle that I gave
[25:36] it a call to
[25:41] battle amen if you could say Amen when
[25:43] you're
[25:45] there amen and it says like
[25:49] this for we do not have a high priest
[25:51] who cannot be touched with the feelings
[25:53] of our infirmities but was in all points
[25:56] tempted as we are yet without
[26:09] sin amen let's bow our
[26:11] heads Lord
[26:13] Jesus give you thanks for this wonderful
[26:16] day you've given
[26:18] us to come and worship
[26:21] you and to hear your
[26:24] word we ask that you may help me and my
[26:26] brothers
[26:29] that will be speaking this
[26:30] evening may speak the right
[26:33] words that we may help the people that
[26:36] are
[26:37] here and that your spirit just may move
[26:40] among
[26:41] us we ask this on your
[26:43] name the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[26:46] amen amen you may be
[26:49] seated amen so um just kind of what I'm
[26:52] going to be talking
[26:54] about is about
[26:56] temptation
[26:58] you see a lot of the times we think
[27:00] temptation is always
[27:03] bad but it has its good to it as
[27:07] well a lot of us see temptation as
[27:10] always
[27:14] failing always falling into the same
[27:18] things but I read something the other
[27:21] day and it says temptation is not
[27:26] sin but it is a call to
[27:30] battle amen how many were called to
[27:32] battle this
[27:35] evening amen you see in the bad sense of
[27:40] Temptation you know it means to
[27:43] tempt to
[27:45] seduce to
[27:47] entice and to pull someone away from
[27:51] God into the way of
[27:54] sin of
[27:56] self and and of Satan you see a lot
[27:59] that's usually how we think of of
[28:01] Temptation a lot of the
[28:04] times and it's correct that's what the
[28:06] devil's trying to
[28:08] do trying to pull us from
[28:13] God trying to make us feel like we are
[28:17] somebody but we're nobody without God
[28:20] Amen see Jesus was
[28:23] nobody without
[28:25] God and it says
[28:28] in the good
[28:30] sense it means to
[28:36] test to
[28:39] try it do not it does not mean to seduce
[28:42] into
[28:44] sin his purpose is not to defeat or to
[28:50] destroy the idea is not that one is
[28:54] tempted seduced en
[28:59] enticed and pulled into the into sin by
[29:02] the Holy
[29:05] Spirit but one is
[29:07] tested
[29:09] proved strengthened
[29:13] reinforced and purified through the
[29:15] trials of
[29:19] Temptation you see through the
[29:22] testing we are pulled forward when we
[29:24] overcome
[29:26] amen
[29:28] you see when the devil was tempting
[29:31] Jesus when he told them to turn the
[29:33] stones into
[29:36] bread and if I could get a water
[29:39] please he wasn't he knew that Jesus
[29:42] could turn the stones into
[29:47] bread he didn't he was he wasn't like
[29:50] saying that he couldn't do
[29:52] it he knew he knew Jesus could do
[29:56] it
[29:57] see but what he really
[29:59] wanted was for Jesus to
[30:03] feel that he was
[30:07] somebody to make a circus out of the
[30:10] Holy
[30:13] Ghost to put on a show for
[30:17] him you see if if he would have done it
[30:20] what would have
[30:22] happened because the devil knew he could
[30:24] do it
[30:26] right he knew that that was in him the
[30:28] power that he
[30:31] had but the devil just wanted to mess
[30:34] with
[30:35] him he wanted to have a
[30:39] show he almost wanted just to sit back
[30:42] and watch a Netflix
[30:46] showflix that's how a lot of times we
[30:49] are we just want to sit back and watch
[30:51] God do
[30:53] everything we don't want to put any work
[30:55] into it
[30:58] we don't want when Temptation
[31:00] comes a lot of the
[31:02] times the Devil
[31:04] comes I'm just going to give a little
[31:07] little illustration
[31:09] here I know my brother right here is not
[31:11] the
[31:12] devil but I know I could use
[31:15] them you see let's say Isaac comes to
[31:19] me Devil's using them just say he's a
[31:22] friend from
[31:25] school saying let's go out to drink
[31:30] and a lot of the times we're not strong
[31:33] enough and a lot of the times we're like
[31:36] well it's okay I'll just go
[31:39] drink can
[31:42] do and we fall that
[31:45] easily we just become
[31:48] friends and first we're like this
[31:52] right now we're like okay now let's go
[31:54] smoke some
[31:56] weed
[31:57] we're getting a little
[31:59] closer now let's let's go with some
[32:02] girls now we get a little
[32:04] closer until that
[32:07] sin that small
[32:09] Temptation turns into something
[32:12] big so now we're stuck
[32:15] together and we can't
[32:17] leave see a lot of the times that's how
[32:19] we
[32:21] are we're stuck to
[32:26] sin
[32:28] and like I
[32:30] said temptation is not
[32:34] sin called to battle
[32:37] amen now what happens in a
[32:41] battle have you guys ever seen movies of
[32:45] War of
[32:47] battle they're not just
[32:51] relaxing what happens
[32:54] before one of my favorite movies is
[32:56] hacka Ridge
[32:59] you see seeing them
[33:01] train they get their
[33:04] guns you know they have to do target
[33:08] practice they just don't send them out
[33:10] to war right
[33:12] away you see and God's doing the same
[33:15] with us he's preparing
[33:18] us when the devil tempts
[33:21] us we are ready for battle
[33:24] amen we are not weak
[33:27] but a lot of the
[33:29] times we think we could handle
[33:33] it so we go out into the
[33:36] world without
[33:38] preparing without listening to our
[33:41] parents withouten to our
[33:44] pastor to the
[33:46] ministers and we think we're
[33:49] ready and then that's when we fall into
[33:52] sin see we we see Jesus went out into
[33:55] the wilderness
[33:57] Wilderness wasn't some pleasurable
[34:02] place it was
[34:04] Desert it was somewhere where no one
[34:06] wanted to
[34:07] be it was
[34:10] hot it wasn't nice and
[34:13] refreshing when it was hot you couldn't
[34:15] have a cooler
[34:18] on you see but it was something
[34:21] something that he went through for us to
[34:26] show us that it's that we are able to do
[34:30] it you see I want to
[34:32] [Music]
[34:33] read a
[34:37] quote my brother
[34:45] brandom and it's it's in the
[34:49] message thou son of David have mercy on
[34:53] me God told them wait down in Egypt
[34:58] I give you that
[34:59] land but he didn't say I'll go out there
[35:02] and sweep it all
[35:05] out and garnish the
[35:08] houses and hang up the curtains and
[35:12] everything you all just move
[35:16] in see God's not going to do that for
[35:19] you God wants you to feel a little bit
[35:22] of some of some hard
[35:25] times
[35:27] you see the Holy Ghost doesn't come in
[35:28] all sweet all the
[35:31] time on the
[35:33] back until you you're not going to go
[35:35] through
[35:36] anything no but he keeps
[35:39] saying no they had to fight for every
[35:41] inch of
[35:50] ground that's right fighting and take by
[35:54] every
[35:55] inch
[35:59] but he said everywhere The Souls of your
[36:01] foot lands that's
[36:07] possession footsteps is
[36:11] possession that's the same thing
[36:16] today Divine Healing belongs to
[36:19] us the Holy Spirit belongs to
[36:22] us our
[36:24] property but you'll have to fight for
[36:26] every of
[36:28] it but brother footstep is
[36:33] possession just keep fighting and take
[36:37] it you see Brothers we got to keep
[36:41] fighting taking foot step after foot
[36:45] step we can't stop
[36:47] fighting because once we
[36:50] stop that's when the
[36:52] devil gets in and takes a hold of us
[36:56] amen
[36:58] you see brother brandom also
[37:00] says you see or before I read
[37:03] that you see a lot of the times we think
[37:06] oh because we fell we already fell into
[37:12] temptation we can't get back up
[37:15] again we think fellure oh I'm not going
[37:17] to come back to church we think because
[37:20] we fa we're not going to come back to
[37:25] church you see I thought about that
[37:27] sometimes as
[37:29] well you see I have struggles as
[37:32] well you guys might just be thinking
[37:34] know he's saying this so
[37:37] confidently but if I were to tell you my
[37:41] struggles guys might not even believe
[37:43] the struggles I go
[37:45] through but you see I say it confidently
[37:50] because I know who my God
[37:52] is I know that he could bring me
[37:55] out see brother brandham says as I was
[37:58] with Moses so will I be with
[38:03] thee although if I am trying and I
[38:09] fail now hear this God won't leave
[38:15] me you see I never had much confidence
[38:17] in anybody in anybody that's too afraid
[38:20] to do
[38:25] anything did you just hear what our
[38:27] Prophet
[38:29] said I don't know if you guys heard it
[38:32] when I read this
[38:34] this this surprised me opened my mind a
[38:37] little
[38:38] bit and he keeps
[38:40] saying I would rather be found a failure
[38:44] than too lazy to
[38:50] try i' rather be called a
[38:53] failure too lazy to try
[38:59] but I don't want to be too lazy to
[39:02] try I want to try my
[39:05] hardest try every
[39:09] way and if I
[39:11] fail I'm goingon to give back up
[39:16] again amen I just want to say a story
[39:19] before my time
[39:21] ends see there's this story that I heard
[39:23] from this brother and it really it was
[39:25] really a good story
[39:29] story and it's real life as well you can
[39:31] look it
[39:33] up a boxing
[39:39] match that lasted 49
[39:43] rounds over two and a half
[39:49] hours just P
[39:51] boxing his name was Joe
[39:54] Janet Joe Janet and s mcvea s m but I
[39:59] just want to focus on Joe
[40:03] Janet you see they lasted 49
[40:09] rounds and Joe Janet fell to the floor
[40:12] Jo
[40:16] Janet 27 times
[40:22] 27 at one
[40:24] point they didn't he was going to get
[40:27] back up
[40:28] again they thought he was
[40:31] done the count was almost over theat the
[40:37] count the Bell was about to
[40:40] ring the ref was about to call
[40:48] it but next thing you know he gets up
[40:54] again you see he got up so many
[40:58] times now hear me
[41:00] Brothers he got up so many
[41:03] times that his opponent on the other
[41:08] side on the 27th
[41:11] time did not want to keep going against
[41:14] this
[41:16] guy now think about
[41:19] that this guy was went beating
[41:22] him the other guy's face was probably
[41:25] destroyed
[41:28] I could even recognize
[41:32] them that's how sometimes the devil has
[41:34] us
[41:36] right we can't even recognize ourselves
[41:38] in the
[41:41] mirror but the crazy thing that
[41:43] surprised me
[41:44] was that his opponent didn't even want
[41:47] to come back out to fight
[41:51] him you see the Falls won't really
[41:55] matter at the end of the
[41:58] day how many times you
[42:01] fall God's not going to look at
[42:04] that but God's going to look at how many
[42:07] times we get back up
[42:11] am surprising thing about this
[42:14] man is not how many times he
[42:17] fell how many times he got
[42:21] back keep getting back
[42:24] up those demons that are surrounding
[42:27] us they're not going to want to get out
[42:29] of their Corner
[42:31] anymore they're going to start getting
[42:34] afraid they're going to be like we don't
[42:36] know what's up with this
[42:38] guy don't know what got into him we
[42:42] don't know what touched them I don't
[42:44] know what it
[42:45] was but when you're
[42:48] God touches your
[42:51] heart and you keep
[42:55] falling you're going to keep getting
[42:57] back up
[42:58] again you see Babe Ruth Babe Ruth hit
[43:02] 714 home
[43:07] runs but he struck out third
[43:12] 1,330
[43:16] times but what's the bigger
[43:19] impact we never hear about his
[43:23] strikeouts but we hear about his home
[43:25] run
[43:28] I tell
[43:29] you don't stick to your
[43:35] failures get back up
[43:38] amen amen I leave you with
[43:42] [Applause]
[43:52] that may please stand to rest a little
[43:55] bit
[43:58] epesi Ephesians
[44:04] [Music]
[44:06] 1:4 following the ministry and the life
[44:08] of our Lord Jesus
[44:12] Christ and in Matthew 4 you find he is
[44:17] tempted Ephesians 1:4 says like
[44:25] this
[44:28] according as he hath chosen Us in him
[44:30] before the foundation of the world that
[44:32] we should be holy and Without Blame
[44:34] before him in
[44:45] love having predestinated us unto the
[44:48] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[44:50] himself according to the good pleasure
[44:52] of his
[44:53] will Romanos
[44:56] and Romans
[44:59] 8:28
[45:11] 29 you find Jesus receiving the holy
[45:14] spirit in the Jordan
[45:17] River the lamb reuniting with the
[45:23] Dove and the dove begins to guide the
[45:28] lamb says like
[45:40] this did for know he also did
[45:43] predestinate to be conformed in the
[45:45] image of his son that he might be in the
[45:47] firstborn among many
[45:54] brethren
[45:59] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[46:01] he also called and whom he called them
[46:04] he also Jus Justified and whom he
[46:06] justified them he also
[46:13] glorified what shall we then say to
[46:15] these things if God is for us who can be
[46:17] against
[46:19] us you may be
[46:24] seated m
[46:29] we see Jesus Christ going out to the
[46:35] Wilderness and after fasting for 40
[46:38] days the devil came and tempts
[46:45] him there his ministry was just
[46:48] starting it was the beginning of his
[46:52] ministry he was already adopted as son
[46:57] God has recognized him as Jesus Jesus
[47:00] Christ as his
[47:02] son and his ministry just
[47:06] started we listen to brother Bram tell
[47:11] us that no one should preach the
[47:15] gospel although he be filled with the
[47:17] Holy
[47:20] Spirit we also find in Matthew
[47:24] 10 that Jesus sends his disciples to go
[47:29] preach even when the Holy Spirit did not
[47:31] come unto them and had not been
[47:36] filled my point here is to the
[47:40] youth and every
[47:43] man and if I speak to the
[47:46] men I also speak to the
[47:50] women because the woman is part of the
[47:52] spirit to the
[47:54] man
[47:57] so I want you to
[47:59] understand that every single one of us
[48:03] every single one of
[48:05] you has been called to the
[48:08] gospel just like Jesus Christ was
[48:12] called Charles brother Bram talks about
[48:14] his brother
[48:16] Charles that he was called to
[48:19] preach although he never
[48:24] preached so every youth and every single
[48:26] one of
[48:26] you has been called to the
[48:30] gospel and being called to the
[48:34] gospel you will be
[48:37] tempted just like Jesus
[48:41] Christ in Romans
[48:46] 8 he he gave his own son he spared not
[48:50] his own
[48:53] son so we find ourselves in this
[48:55] situation
[48:57] since we are
[48:59] born God has called
[49:02] us he called many prophets from the womb
[49:05] of the mother and we see
[49:09] here that he predestinated
[49:12] us before he formed the
[49:15] world he called
[49:19] us so he had called every single one of
[49:21] you as he has called
[49:24] me
[49:26] he's also called
[49:28] you every single one of you
[49:31] women to stand beside your your
[49:37] man that's why many times us as
[49:42] adults we try to give advice to the
[49:45] young lady the young
[49:52] man to look closely at the man she's
[49:54] going to choose as a husband
[49:58] usband and to the man to the wife that
[50:00] he will
[50:02] take and we ask ourselves
[50:07] why we find that the
[50:10] women has a decision to
[50:14] make as she is
[50:16] single God is her
[50:19] [Applause]
[50:21] Lord but when she is about to choose a
[50:24] husband
[50:25] [Applause]
[50:27] although God is over all
[50:33] things she has to be a willing to give
[50:39] her she has to be able to submit herself
[50:42] to that
[50:47] man willing to let that man lead her to
[50:51] eternal
[50:54] life when you
[50:58] you see it that
[51:03] way you see it's a very serious
[51:09] topic the same way as
[51:12] us as a
[51:16] church when we come to a moment to
[51:18] choose a
[51:20] pastor we must make
[51:22] sure you as youth
[51:27] that the lady you're going to
[51:30] marry that that lady be filled with the
[51:33] Holy
[51:34] [Applause]
[51:37] Spirit young lady with the man you will
[51:41] marry that he be filled with the Holy
[51:43] Spirit
[51:48] why because it will save you from many
[51:53] problems we find the the Lord Jesus
[51:55] Christ
[51:57] here being tempted by the
[52:00] devil this brother Bram
[52:05] says that those three
[52:10] Temptations He first tempted his
[52:14] flesh next he tempted his
[52:17] sight and lastly he tested his
[52:23] pride every temptation
[52:28] that we
[52:29] have is a trial we have we must go
[52:37] through I took a class to be a teacher
[52:40] in
[52:42] English and one thing they showed me in
[52:44] that
[52:48] class because they taught us when we
[52:50] take a new
[52:52] group we make a test right away
[53:00] and the test was to
[53:03] know their English
[53:08] level it was not to approve them or fail
[53:14] them many times Temptation shows you to
[53:20] know what stage at in your
[53:24] growth
[53:26] if you keep falling in the same
[53:33] mistake it's because you have not taken
[53:36] the
[53:38] full you haven't taken the Lord Jesus
[53:41] Christ as your
[53:46] Lord why we resist many
[53:48] times as
[53:51] women that her
[53:54] husband
[53:56] be our be completely our
[54:00] Lord many times as
[54:03] husbands we don't take advice from our
[54:08] women I've have taken note that that is
[54:10] my
[54:11] mistake every time I have been
[54:14] tempted and I have
[54:17] fallen it's because I been taken him by
[54:19] his
[54:24] word and that's where we all
[54:28] fall that's why it's
[54:31] necessary and the beginning of the
[54:33] preaching of he
[54:37] told it is you must be born
[54:42] again but that's just the
[54:48] beginning one has not received the Holy
[54:51] Spirit but has received the beginning
[54:56] and has has begin this
[55:00] journey as long as you haven't been born
[55:04] again you are still in the
[55:07] flesh you keep falling in the
[55:11] flesh repeating the same mistake once
[55:14] over and over
[55:16] again because you haven't taken him by
[55:18] his
[55:21] word what does it mean to take him by
[55:23] his word
[55:28] well that
[55:35] question have you accepted the
[55:38] Propet of this age brother William Mar
[55:44] brandom he has revealed all the all the
[55:48] Mysteries and he has
[55:53] said that the Wom and should not cut her
[55:56] hair and we do we do
[55:59] it we keep on doing
[56:04] it brother Bram tells us many
[56:10] things but we don't obey
[56:14] them so we have not been born
[56:18] again because we haven't B been born of
[56:20] the
[56:21] word that is being born
[56:23] again being born Of The
[56:27] World God gives you another
[56:31] nature because the nature we're born
[56:36] with will take you to make them same
[56:38] mistake a thousand
[56:43] times although we see the Lord Jesus
[56:45] Christ being
[56:46] tempted he was already
[56:51] adopted he was in the beginning of his
[56:53] ministry
[56:56] but we're taking it down to a
[56:58] level a little lower
[57:02] level or every day we're being
[57:05] tempted from the moment we wake
[57:09] up our our thought is to do
[57:13] evil and God disgusted
[57:17] himself when he saw in the times of
[57:20] no to think of
[57:23] man the thought of man was to con do
[57:27] evil but we think to do
[57:32] evil is to smoke is
[57:34] to no
[57:38] brothers is to disobey the word of
[57:44] God to do evil
[57:46] is
[57:50] word see how the devil has deceived
[57:53] us
[57:55] we struggle with many
[57:57] addictions as a young
[58:00] lady you also struggle a lot in your
[58:04] mind but we think that these
[58:08] Temptations sometimes going out with
[58:10] friends and listening to some
[58:12] music oh how much we like the music from
[58:14] the
[58:16] world we like that beat that makes us
[58:19] move I tell you that because I lived
[58:23] it and when we say a bad
[58:27] word we feel
[58:30] good but that is not the
[58:34] sin that's an attribute of
[58:38] sin how the devil is deceiving
[58:41] you what the devil wants you to
[58:45] do is the same thing he did with Eve in
[58:48] the
[58:50] beginning is to take you away from the
[58:52] word not from church
[58:56] not from church
[58:59] brother he's leaving you away from the
[59:03] word he Strays you away from the
[59:08] prophet he Strays you away from your
[59:10] daily reading of the
[59:14] Bible sin is
[59:20] unbelief and if you keep falling into
[59:23] temptation
[59:25] there is unbelief in
[59:27] you that's when you need to
[59:30] worry you need to worry
[59:36] then because when we St away even
[59:39] aeter from the word of
[59:42] God from a straight
[59:45] line 100 steps
[59:50] forward we'll be meters away from where
[59:52] we
[59:53] started
[59:55] just from one M millimeter from where we
[1:00:03] deviated so what was the devil trying to
[1:00:05] do with
[1:00:07] Jesus to deny the
[1:00:09] word stray him away from the
[1:00:13] word temp him like he did to
[1:00:16] Eve but he could not do
[1:00:19] it because he was the
[1:00:23] word can me the
[1:00:28] word although we understand he said it
[1:00:33] is but that word was already
[1:00:36] inside it was
[1:00:38] him and
[1:00:40] we as we have
[1:00:43] read we must come to be
[1:00:46] like that's why he predestinated us
[1:00:50] that's
[1:00:52] why finishing here
[1:01:00] when we were in his
[1:01:04] thoughts he created us and he created a
[1:01:06] theophany for
[1:01:08] us but
[1:01:11] we that are living presently
[1:01:15] here we can't go
[1:01:18] into we over Overlook
[1:01:21] our overpass this theophany
[1:01:26] as fleshly
[1:01:28] beings as weak
[1:01:30] beings but
[1:01:33] here we
[1:01:35] taste or we
[1:01:37] improve inch by
[1:01:43] inch there waiting for us God bless you
[1:01:49] [Music]
[1:01:53] Brothers
[1:01:56] God bless
[1:01:58] everyone it's good to see everybody in
[1:02:00] the house of the
[1:02:04] Lord we'll be a reading from uh Luke
[1:02:08] chapter
[1:02:10] 4 verse 1 to
[1:02:15] 4 yeah I I really enjoy a preaching to
[1:02:18] the
[1:02:21] youth you know you guys very special to
[1:02:24] to
[1:02:25] me uh and uh you know it's good it's
[1:02:28] good to to see you guys
[1:02:31] here uh Luke 4 verse
[1:02:34] 1-4 reads like
[1:02:38] this says then Jesus being filled with
[1:02:41] the Holy Spirit uh returned from the
[1:02:44] Jordan and was led by the spirit Into
[1:02:47] the
[1:02:53] Wilderness
[1:03:00] says being tempted for 40 days by the
[1:03:02] devil and in those days he ate nothing
[1:03:05] and afterward when they had ended he was
[1:03:17] hungry and the devil said to him if you
[1:03:20] are the Son of God command this this
[1:03:23] Stone the stone to be become
[1:03:35] bread uh God may God add um blessings to
[1:03:38] the reading of his
[1:03:41] word uh you know when we uh look at the
[1:03:44] the scene
[1:03:46] here uh you know as a brother Enoch was
[1:03:50] saying it says that Jesus had been
[1:03:52] adopted you know by by
[1:03:56] God uh you know in other
[1:03:59] words uh the heavens were
[1:04:03] opened oh that the heavens would open
[1:04:06] this
[1:04:10] evening that they would open you know to
[1:04:13] each and every one of
[1:04:16] us yeah but I don't
[1:04:18] believe that you know God would open up
[1:04:21] the
[1:04:23] heavens you know and pour out his
[1:04:27] Spirit uh just so you can feel good for
[1:04:30] a
[1:04:33] moment uh because if you
[1:04:35] notice it says Jesus being filled with
[1:04:38] the
[1:04:41] spirit it says he was led by the Holy
[1:04:47] Spirit Into the
[1:04:49] Wilderness so he went from a
[1:04:53] high
[1:04:55] you know you ever felt that
[1:04:57] high you know when the spirit of God
[1:05:00] comes
[1:05:02] down and you just want to stay up
[1:05:07] there uh because it's a great place to
[1:05:11] be you see but when you're up
[1:05:14] there you see when you're on the
[1:05:18] Mountaintop oh you know brother Bram
[1:05:21] says no fruit grows on the mountain top
[1:05:26] it grows it it grows in the
[1:05:29] valley so he goes from The
[1:05:34] Mountaintop uh you know he goes down
[1:05:36] into the
[1:05:38] Wilderness and other words heaven was
[1:05:44] open but hell the jaws of Hell opened as
[1:05:50] well amen amen I I I believe that
[1:05:55] amen amen you know and
[1:05:57] remember you see he was led by the
[1:06:04] spirit amen amen he was led by the
[1:06:08] spirit if you are led by the
[1:06:13] spirit you have to be in the
[1:06:17] spirit you know when you're in the
[1:06:21] spirit you know how things begin to
[1:06:23] change
[1:06:25] I want to ask the
[1:06:27] youth are you here in the
[1:06:31] spirit because when you're in the
[1:06:34] spirit and you begin to see
[1:06:37] things that you don't
[1:06:40] see and you begin to hear
[1:06:43] things that you haven't
[1:06:46] heard are you see you begin to feel
[1:06:50] things that you've never
[1:06:53] felt
[1:06:54] oh that God would bring his
[1:06:58] spirit that there would be somebody
[1:07:01] here to receive his
[1:07:06] Spirit we just need one person
[1:07:10] here brother says God just needs one
[1:07:15] man
[1:07:17] surrendered with that
[1:07:20] Spirit where that Spirit can feel that
[1:07:23] person
[1:07:25] you watch what he
[1:07:32] does I was sharing with the guys in the
[1:07:37] back you know you can be so filled with
[1:07:40] the
[1:07:42] spirit because Jesus was filled with the
[1:07:46] spirit you see when he was filled with
[1:07:48] that
[1:07:50] Spirit there was no more room for
[1:07:53] anything else
[1:07:55] there was no more room for the
[1:07:58] devil because he was filled with the
[1:08:01] spirit you see you can get to a
[1:08:04] place where you are so
[1:08:07] filled that the
[1:08:10] impact that you make on the people
[1:08:12] around
[1:08:16] you they can feel it as
[1:08:19] well it it is there something that
[1:08:22] induces something else
[1:08:27] is something that is
[1:08:31] induced you see when the spirit of God
[1:08:34] comes
[1:08:36] down it provokes
[1:08:39] something it brings something to
[1:08:42] you or when you are in the
[1:08:48] spirit are we in the
[1:08:52] spirit
[1:08:55] thank you Lord when
[1:08:59] God or the Holy Spirit leads Jesus Into
[1:09:02] the
[1:09:08] Wilderness we understand that he's
[1:09:13] tempted you see and like Isaac was
[1:09:16] saying like Isaac was
[1:09:19] saying Temptation you know isn't a bad
[1:09:23] thing
[1:09:24] [Applause]
[1:09:27] you see
[1:09:29] Temptation it's actually a
[1:09:34] revelation of what you struggle
[1:09:38] with without
[1:09:41] Temptation you would never
[1:09:44] know of what your struggles
[1:09:49] are are you guys
[1:09:51] understanding you see so what Temptation
[1:09:56] does it brings
[1:09:59] out of what the
[1:10:02] flesh or what the inside of
[1:10:06] you sir what's in
[1:10:09] there that that's what Temptation
[1:10:14] does it brings out the struggle to your
[1:10:18] passions it brings out the the lust the
[1:10:22] desires and they brings all that
[1:10:26] out or what are you hungering for this
[1:10:29] this this
[1:10:31] evening what are we hungering
[1:10:36] for I was a young man one
[1:10:39] time so I know the
[1:10:42] struggles you see the struggles
[1:10:45] real but the holy spirit is real
[1:10:50] too it's so
[1:10:52] real it didn't
[1:10:55] care it didn't care to lead Jesus Into
[1:10:58] the
[1:11:00] Wilderness because it because God
[1:11:04] knew that that he's not he wasn't going
[1:11:07] to give it to
[1:11:09] Jesus just so he could have
[1:11:12] it and God doesn't give you the Holy
[1:11:14] Spirit just to sit in the
[1:11:18] church he's going to put it to the
[1:11:22] test because he
[1:11:24] knows that that's the best that he's
[1:11:29] got as a matter of
[1:11:31] fact that's all that he
[1:11:34] has because that's all that that we
[1:11:39] need to defeat the
[1:11:42] Devil that's all that we
[1:11:44] need we don't need anything
[1:11:47] else to defeat the
[1:11:51] Devil I want you to
[1:11:54] understand that the first
[1:11:58] Temptation he attacks the
[1:12:02] flesh you see because Jesus was a
[1:12:05] man he was all man he was tempted in all
[1:12:11] ways so he could
[1:12:15] sympathize so he could
[1:12:19] understand what a young man a young lady
[1:12:21] goes through
[1:12:25] he he he he went through all those
[1:12:28] things he was
[1:12:30] hungry he got
[1:12:33] sick you see he he knew what it was like
[1:12:35] to lack
[1:12:40] things amen that's that's exactly
[1:12:46] right so Jesus is
[1:12:50] tempted but to to make these stones into
[1:12:53] bread
[1:12:56] and Adam and
[1:12:58] Eve if you
[1:13:00] notice they were tempted as
[1:13:05] well but they were tempted in the Garden
[1:13:07] of
[1:13:10] Eden in a place that was full of
[1:13:14] fruit but Jesus is
[1:13:18] tempted in a
[1:13:20] place where there's nothing to eat
[1:13:25] where it is
[1:13:27] dry and there's not a church member in
[1:13:32] sight the pastor wasn't
[1:13:35] there or your mom wasn't
[1:13:38] there your dad wasn't
[1:13:41] there but the Holy
[1:13:44] Spirit he was
[1:13:48] there and he's
[1:13:51] here amen
[1:13:54] amen
[1:13:56] hallelujah God is good
[1:13:59] Brothers he is so
[1:14:05] good he did all of
[1:14:09] this in order to
[1:14:12] prepare
[1:14:15] Jesus for a public
[1:14:20] Ministry a more public than what it was
[1:14:25] so we go through a
[1:14:29] Temptation so that so that we are
[1:14:36] prepared for something
[1:14:39] public not to make a
[1:14:43] show or not to be
[1:14:48] entertainment that's not what it's
[1:14:51] for because you know what you let by the
[1:14:55] spirit you see it just it just does
[1:14:58] something to
[1:15:00] you it it brings it brings you into
[1:15:03] complete
[1:15:06] obedience amen amen you think we just
[1:15:09] need to get in the
[1:15:12] spirit and wherever God leads
[1:15:15] us and when you leave this
[1:15:18] place and when you leave this place this
[1:15:21] evening are you
[1:15:25] believe that the devil's going to be
[1:15:29] waiting because he's going to want to
[1:15:33] prove to see what you
[1:15:37] say if it's real or
[1:15:40] not that's so we got to be filled with
[1:15:42] that
[1:15:45] Spirit we need to get to a
[1:15:48] place oh I'm going to finish my story I
[1:15:50] know I left you know kind of halfway
[1:15:52] earlier
[1:15:57] but when you are filled with the
[1:16:00] spirit you see there was a you know this
[1:16:02] is a a famous
[1:16:06] person but you know they say that you
[1:16:08] know Arnold
[1:16:11] shener uh when he would uh go to the
[1:16:14] gym uh you know when he walked in
[1:16:18] there when he would walk into the
[1:16:22] gym but they say that the
[1:16:27] gymm would Elevate to another
[1:16:32] level because he was
[1:16:34] there now if a natural
[1:16:38] man maybe was not filled with the
[1:16:42] spirit I could Elevate these
[1:16:46] people to another
[1:16:48] level what could the Holy Ghost
[1:16:52] do could the Holy Ghost
[1:16:56] do could he Elevate
[1:16:59] you to another
[1:17:03] level that's
[1:17:05] right I believe he could do
[1:17:10] it brother brandham says
[1:17:12] this in the
[1:17:15] message the
[1:17:18] resurrection he said I believe that the
[1:17:20] holy spirit is here
[1:17:25] he's the one that fills
[1:17:28] us and our life is not our
[1:17:32] own but it's the life of the holy spirit
[1:17:35] in us that makes us
[1:17:40] Christians I
[1:17:42] believe that every fiber of a
[1:17:45] Christian's body is controlled by the
[1:17:47] Holy
[1:17:52] Spirit
[1:17:53] I believe that your eyes
[1:17:55] are but you can't help it when you look
[1:17:58] to see an
[1:18:01] evil but if you lost after
[1:18:04] it you already committed
[1:18:07] adultery you turn your
[1:18:10] head the holy spirit makes you do
[1:18:14] that is that right you might be
[1:18:20] tempted temptation is not a sin
[1:18:25] heing your temptation is
[1:18:31] sin it says you can be
[1:18:35] tempted Christ was tempted like we
[1:18:39] are but he never
[1:18:41] sinned so the holy spirit is God that
[1:18:44] helps us bear out the truth of
[1:18:49] God and we're ready to dread of all man
[1:18:56] amen
[1:18:58] amen I'm closing
[1:19:04] now when we talk about the Holy
[1:19:08] Spirit and
[1:19:11] E we see
[1:19:14] that God would not wouldn't
[1:19:18] send Jesus if he was not
[1:19:21] prepared
[1:19:24] God would not have sent or he would not
[1:19:25] have led Jesus Into the
[1:19:30] Wilderness if he was not
[1:19:35] prepared If
[1:19:37] he if he had not equipped
[1:19:41] him you know and we know that brother
[1:19:43] Bram says that God equips his
[1:19:47] men God equips his
[1:19:50] church he equips his sons and
[1:19:55] daughters you are
[1:19:59] equipped to do the
[1:20:02] work of Jesus
[1:20:06] Christ in this
[1:20:09] time I believe
[1:20:13] that and when I think about you know the
[1:20:16] years that have gone
[1:20:21] by It's been a 14
[1:20:25] years
[1:20:28] January January
[1:20:37] 30th I gave my life to
[1:20:40] [Applause]
[1:20:42] Christ and now when I think about that
[1:20:49] moment and I think about how serious I
[1:20:51] took it
[1:21:00] and I think about you know the 14 years
[1:21:02] that have
[1:21:07] passed the
[1:21:09] struggles The
[1:21:14] Temptations the hard
[1:21:17] times the times I might have lost the
[1:21:21] battle
[1:21:25] [Music]
[1:21:28] and it wasn't because the Holy Ghost
[1:21:29] wasn't good
[1:21:34] enough because it
[1:21:37] is what happens
[1:21:40] is that we fall into
[1:21:44] temptation we fall into the lustly
[1:21:50] desires we hunger
[1:21:55] and sometimes we don't hunger for the
[1:21:57] right
[1:21:59] things we're not hungering you know for
[1:22:02] more of
[1:22:03] God we're not
[1:22:06] hungering for more of his
[1:22:09] word we're not
[1:22:11] hungry for the right
[1:22:14] things and that's why we
[1:22:17] fail that's why we
[1:22:19] fall it's not cuz the Holy Ghost wasn't
[1:22:21] good enough
[1:22:24] because I believe it
[1:22:26] is and I believe that if it wasn't for
[1:22:30] the Holy
[1:22:32] Ghost not a single one of
[1:22:35] us I would be
[1:22:38] here and I'm
[1:22:41] here because the Holy Ghost is good
[1:22:45] enough the Holy
[1:22:47] Ghost has brought me
[1:22:51] through when when when other people
[1:22:54] didn't help
[1:22:55] me when I was all
[1:22:58] alone when I was
[1:23:01] sad when I was
[1:23:03] depressed when when somebody else
[1:23:05] couldn't help
[1:23:07] me there times that the pastor can't
[1:23:09] even help
[1:23:12] you he can't always help
[1:23:15] you he'll be there for
[1:23:17] you he'll be there for you H but he
[1:23:21] can't always do it for you
[1:23:24] but you have to go through
[1:23:26] it and the Holy
[1:23:28] Ghost will bring you
[1:23:31] through he'll bring you through the
[1:23:35] struggles he'll bring you through the
[1:23:39] fights he'll bring you through the
[1:23:42] battles and you'll come
[1:23:45] out you'll come out
[1:23:48] Victorious and you
[1:23:51] say maybe I don't
[1:23:54] feel
[1:23:56] anything that's okay you don't have
[1:24:01] to you say maybe I don't cry like
[1:24:04] everybody
[1:24:06] else you don't have
[1:24:08] to you don't have to cry like everybody
[1:24:12] else but you can
[1:24:15] say
[1:24:17] God I believe
[1:24:20] you I believe you
[1:24:23] I believe that what you have given
[1:24:27] me is going to bring me
[1:24:30] through it'll bring me through the
[1:24:34] Temptation and it'll make me not a
[1:24:39] victim but
[1:24:42] Victorious I'll be
[1:24:45] victorious I'll get up one more
[1:24:49] time and I'll bring the fight
[1:24:54] every
[1:24:56] ounce of the Holy Ghost that I
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:02] have we'll defeat the
[1:25:05] Devil we'll defeat the
[1:25:08] Devil any
[1:25:11] place any
[1:25:13] time brother bham
[1:25:16] says that he went to
[1:25:19] Jesus in Jesus's weakest moment
[1:25:22] [Applause]
[1:25:26] and Jesus still
[1:25:28] won he still
[1:25:30] won he was
[1:25:32] weak he was
[1:25:35] hungry but he still defeated
[1:25:39] him and you can defeat him
[1:25:42] too you may be you may feel
[1:25:45] weak you may feel
[1:25:48] hungry you may feel
[1:25:51] sad you may feel
[1:25:55] depressed the good thing
[1:25:58] is we don't go by feelings
[1:26:04] here we are led by
[1:26:07] [Music]

[1:46:42] wonderful you can have your
[1:46:45] seats beautiful word we
[1:46:47] heard can take something with us amen
[1:46:51] amen God spoke to us in many ways very
[1:46:55] special
[1:46:57] ways according to Temptation or about
[1:47:04] Temptation about the times in which
[1:47:05] we're
[1:47:07] tempted we have a holy spirit we have a
[1:47:11] help we're not
[1:47:14] alone God sent us
[1:47:17] help that sent us the help that we
[1:47:19] needed
[1:47:22] sometimes we simply forget or we don't
[1:47:25] want the
[1:47:28] help I was
[1:47:31] remembering when we went to
[1:47:35] Israel if I remember
[1:47:38] correctly we went to the River Jordan
[1:47:42] first the Jordan River is in the
[1:47:46] desert and I think after that we went to
[1:47:49] this mountain where he was
[1:47:51] tempted and the devil tried to tempt us
[1:47:55] there the spirit of the devil was still
[1:47:57] around those
[1:47:59] parts and he tempted us with the
[1:48:04] food the Lord Jesus Christ with the
[1:48:08] food but the thing was that I I got
[1:48:11] upset
[1:48:15] um because some of us that were in that
[1:48:18] group they couldn't withstand the
[1:48:33] hunger when you get up this mountain
[1:48:35] they call it the mountain of
[1:48:38] Temptation and you go
[1:48:41] climbing and I think it's so
[1:48:46] tremendous that when you get to the
[1:48:47] mountain of
[1:48:48] Temptation there a restaurant
[1:48:54] there and I thought in the Lord Jesus
[1:48:58] Christ how the devil basically almost
[1:49:00] just put the food right there front in
[1:49:03] the mountain of
[1:49:04] Temptation where it's believe that Jesus
[1:49:06] was
[1:49:07] tempted there's a restaurant
[1:49:11] there where Jesus was tempted to
[1:49:14] eat and we're waiting for Brother
[1:49:18] Caleb group was with from New Mexico
[1:49:21] from
[1:49:22] Cruses for them to arrive and I
[1:49:26] told I told the group that was with
[1:49:29] we're going to eat with brother
[1:49:32] Caleb once we get off the mountain of
[1:49:35] Temptation there's a restaurant down
[1:49:37] there in
[1:49:39] Jericho and we're going to eat
[1:49:44] there and I went to go see where the
[1:49:46] incline
[1:49:49] was I went to go see the path of of
[1:49:52] where it led up to where the Lord Jesus
[1:49:54] was
[1:49:57] tempted when I came back everyone was
[1:49:59] seated at the table and they were ready
[1:50:02] to
[1:50:02] eat when I had just told
[1:50:07] them that after we got down from the
[1:50:10] mountain the thing was that they weren't
[1:50:12] able to withstand the Temptation
[1:50:15] brothers and I didn't withstand my
[1:50:19] anger
[1:50:21] so the devil tempted us in many ways I
[1:50:24] scolded them
[1:50:26] harshly and they seen me very
[1:50:34] angry still got off the M
[1:50:38] after after we seen all the sights of
[1:50:41] where the Lord Jesus
