[26:54] as
[26:54] well for giving me the trust to be here
[26:59] man as as you're standing may you please
[27:01] open your Bibles to John chapter
[27:06] 1 verse 10 to
[27:11] 14 when you have me please say
[27:19] amen and it says like
[27:22] this he was in the world and the world
[27:25] was made by him and the world World knew
[27:28] him
[27:33] not he came unto his own and his own
[27:37] received him
[27:41] not but as many as received
[27:46] him to them gave he power to become the
[27:50] sons of
[27:55] God even to them that believe on his
[28:00] name which were born not of blood nor of
[28:03] the will of the flesh nor of the will of
[28:06] man but of
[28:13] God and the Word was made flesh and
[28:16] dwelt among
[28:20] us and we beheld his
[28:23] glory and the glory as of the glory
[28:27] Glory as of the only begotten of the
[28:29] father full of grace and
[28:35] truth amen may we bow our heads
[28:38] Brothers dear Lord gracious Heavenly
[28:41] Father we give you thanks
[28:43] Lord for giving us another day of
[28:46] life thank you Lord for allowing us to
[28:48] be here tonight
[28:50] Lord there's no place where I would
[28:52] rather be
[28:54] Lord than to be here Lord
[28:58] Lord I ask you in this night
[29:01] Lord may you was my lips
[29:04] Lord Lord may it be you talking tonight
[29:07] Lord May the focus not be on me tonight
[29:10] Lord may it be on Only You
[29:13] Lord Lord may you help me
[29:16] tonight may you help my brother Gustavo
[29:19] as well
[29:21] Lord and Lord may may this message
[29:24] Lord be a help for one person
[29:30] I ask all this in Jesus
[29:32] name amen amen you may take your seats
[29:36] Brothers tonight I along with my brother
[29:42] Gustavo we want to focus on the story of
[29:46] Jesus's
[29:50] childhood and for a title we have put it
[29:55] as do we truly know our
[29:59] father you know if you could let that
[30:01] sink in
[30:04] Brothers if you could meditate on this
[30:07] question do we truly know our
[30:10] father you know cuz many people could
[30:13] say they know our
[30:15] father but at the same
[30:18] time they don't want to serve
[30:21] him you see looking into the
[30:24] Bible the Bible doesn't mention a lot
[30:29] about Jesus's
[30:31] childhood see very little is told about
[30:34] Jesus's
[30:36] childhood you see between Jesus's
[30:40] birth and the beginning of his
[30:43] ministry not much not much is
[30:47] mentioned but when you read the
[30:50] Bible the few the few references that we
[30:53] can get
[30:56] brother of Jesus's
[30:58] childhood is in the Book of
[31:01] Luke you know but what we must
[31:04] understand
[31:05] Brothers is that the childhood of
[31:09] Jesus wasn't anything out of this
[31:13] world it wasn't anything out of the
[31:18] ordinary you see Jesus experienced a
[31:20] natural growing
[31:25] process similar to any other growing
[31:30] boy you see but what stood out of
[31:34] Jesus what stood out of young Jesus
[31:38] Christ you see was the
[31:40] wisdom in which he had at such a young
[31:45] age in which God gave
[31:48] him you see Luke 2 verse 40
[31:53] says and the child grew and waxed strong
[31:56] in spirits
[32:04] filled with wisdom and the grace of God
[32:06] was upon
[32:09] Him Jesus at such a young
[32:13] age was strong in strong in
[32:17] spirit and was filled with wisdom
[32:20] brothers and in one
[32:23] occasion we can see this in Luke 2: 41
[32:26] and
[32:31] and In this
[32:33] passage we can see that Jesus and his
[32:37] family they traveled to
[32:40] Jerusalem for a
[32:43] festival in which it was called the
[32:47] Passover and the
[32:49] Passover it was a Jewish
[32:54] holiday in which Israel celebrated
[32:58] as a remembrance of
[33:03] deliverance from slavery in
[33:06] Egypt verse 41
[33:09] says now his parents went to Jerusalem
[33:12] every year at the Feast of the
[33:18] Passover and when he was 12 years
[33:21] old they went up to
[33:24] Jerusalem after the custom of the feast
[33:28] so seeing here
[33:30] Brothers we see that Mary
[33:33] Joseph and young
[33:36] Jesus celebrated the
[33:40] Passover which lasted seven
[33:44] days and it says in verse
[33:47] 43 and when they had fulfilled the
[33:51] days and as they
[33:55] returned and the the child jesus carried
[33:58] behind in
[34:01] Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew
[34:04] not of
[34:06] it so after the seven seven days of the
[34:09] Passover War
[34:12] over on the eighth
[34:14] day they set out to leave back to
[34:19] Nazareth but we see that
[34:22] eventually that Mary and Joseph find
[34:25] out
[34:27] that Jesus was not with
[34:30] them you see we see that
[34:33] Jesus remained behind in
[34:36] Jerusalem while his
[34:39] family had already begun the trip back
[34:41] to
[34:44] Nazareth you see verse 44
[34:48] says but they supposing him to have been
[34:52] in the company went a Day's
[34:55] Journey
[34:59] and they sought him among their King
[35:01] Kings folk and
[35:05] acquaintance verse 45 and when they
[35:07] found him
[35:09] not they turned back again to
[35:13] Jerusalem you know the city of Jerusalem
[35:16] brother you see was one of the biggest
[35:19] cities in all of
[35:21] Israel at that time it was one of the
[35:23] biggest cities in
[35:25] Israel I could already
[35:29] imagine and how Joseph
[35:32] felt filled with
[35:35] anguish fear knowing that their son was
[35:39] out
[35:42] there and you see verse 46
[35:47] says and it came to
[35:50] pass that after three
[35:53] days they found him in the
[35:55] temple
[35:57] sitting in the midst of the
[36:00] doctors both hearing
[36:03] them and asking them
[36:06] questions you see so Mary and
[36:09] Joseph after three days
[36:12] Brothers you see they find little Jesus
[36:15] in the
[36:17] temple in which the
[36:20] doctors and the teachers of the
[36:23] law would impart their teachings to
[36:26] others
[36:29] and here it
[36:31] occurs that little
[36:33] Jesus a boy of 12 years
[36:36] old is in this
[36:39] Temple you see and the Bible says that
[36:42] he was talking to the doctors of the
[36:46] law you see Brothers I want you to focus
[36:49] here
[36:49] tonight you see Jesus was a
[36:52] child he was a little
[36:55] child and these doctors and these
[36:58] teachers you see they were specialists
[37:01] in
[37:02] writing they were
[37:05] theolog you see they were people who
[37:08] spent their entire
[37:12] lives you know studying the
[37:15] law and studying the
[37:19] scriptures you see but the Bible
[37:21] says that these
[37:24] doctors these teachers were so
[37:28] surprised they were so
[37:30] amazed with the
[37:32] wisdom that our Lord Jesus Christ
[37:36] had you see not only that
[37:39] brother you see but the scripture also
[37:42] says that when Mary and
[37:45] Joseph found him in the
[37:48] temple you see they were
[37:50] surprised they were
[37:53] amazed you see with the understandings
[37:55] that he had
[37:58] just imagine of a boy of 12 years
[38:01] old surrounded by these
[38:04] doctors you see verse 48
[38:08] says and when they saw
[38:11] him they were
[38:13] amazed and his mother said unto
[38:16] him son why hast thou thou thus dealt
[38:21] with
[38:23] us Behold thy father and I have S these
[38:27] s
[38:30] Sorrowing and he said unto
[38:33] them how is it that ye sought
[38:39] me wish ye not that I must be about my
[38:43] father's
[38:48] business you see
[38:49] Brothers they were so amazed and
[38:53] surprised because first of all Brothers
[38:57] you see
[38:58] Jesus had no
[39:01] indication of being
[39:04] lost you see he looked calm when when
[39:07] Mary Found Jesus in the
[39:10] temple I believe that he didn't look
[39:14] lost little
[39:16] Jesus he knew where he
[39:20] was he knew where he
[39:22] was you see he knew his
[39:25] purpose of why he was in that
[39:29] Temple you see it was no
[39:31] coincidence it was no coincidence at
[39:34] all that little
[39:36] Jesus was in that
[39:39] Temple you see he knew what his purpose
[39:43] was and what his mission
[39:46] was and that was to know his father's
[39:52] business
[39:55] father's but the problem with Mary and
[39:59] Joseph is that they couldn't
[40:01] understand they couldn't
[40:04] understand why Jesus was in the temple
[40:06] in the first
[40:08] place they told
[40:10] Jesus Son why have you done this to
[40:14] us we were so worried for
[40:17] you but young Jesus
[40:20] knew he knew his
[40:23] task he knew his priority
[40:27] he knew his
[40:29] purpose and why he needed to be in that
[40:33] Temple you see I believe Jesus
[40:36] said where else would I
[40:39] be than in my father's
[40:42] house where else would I
[40:44] be in my father's
[40:47] business see Jesus knew who his father
[40:51] was maybe Mary
[40:54] thought that that Joseph was the
[40:58] father you see but that was his Earthly
[41:01] father Jesus knew who his true father
[41:05] was and if I could ask you all a
[41:07] question
[41:09] tonight do we truly know our
[41:13] father do we truly know our
[41:16] father you see we come to
[41:20] church
[41:22] Wednesday Friday Sunday three a week
[41:27] brother we come to
[41:29] church but sometimes although we come to
[41:34] church we don't know what we're doing
[41:37] here know we're
[41:40] here we don't know what what's the
[41:43] reason that we're in
[41:46] church we don't you see we just come to
[41:51] church because at this point
[41:54] Brothers it is a r R for us to
[41:59] go Wednesday has come let's go to
[42:03] church Friday has come let's go to
[42:06] church Sunday has come let's go to
[42:08] church see but we're living it like a
[42:12] routine you see we are living in a
[42:16] Time youth we are living in a
[42:19] time we need Jesus every
[42:22] day not just
[42:24] Wednesday not just Friday
[42:27] not just
[42:28] Sunday we need him every day we need him
[42:36] every we need more of
[42:39] God just three with just three days
[42:42] we're not going to have
[42:44] enough we need more of
[42:47] his how many believe that
[42:49] tonight we need more of
[42:52] Jesus you see
[42:54] Brothers we need him every
[42:57] moment and for the
[43:00] Youth you know for the
[43:02] Youth for the Youth it's very hard
[43:05] living in this
[43:07] age you know it's it's hard for the
[43:10] Youth to live in this
[43:13] generation no we're surrounded by
[43:16] Darkness we're surrounded by
[43:19] corruption we're surrounded by social
[43:22] media we surrounded by
[43:25] lust we're we're surrounded by
[43:29] hatred by
[43:31] violence and all of these things and we
[43:34] come to
[43:35] church influenced by these
[43:38] things you see our minds are too
[43:42] occupied with the things of this
[43:45] world to the point where
[43:48] Jesus can't dwell in
[43:50] us there's nothing but darkness in
[43:55] US know that there is darkness in
[43:59] me you see because if I could be honest
[44:02] brother I sin every
[44:04] day I do what I I do things I'm not
[44:07] supposed to
[44:08] do I sin
[44:10] today we need more of
[44:13] Jesus you see
[44:15] Brothers brother Bram
[44:18] says that we got to shake
[44:21] ourselves you got to shake
[44:24] ourselves and we have to
[44:26] realize that we are men and women of
[44:30] God we are the creation of
[44:33] God this world isn't our
[44:37] home this world will never be our
[44:40] home you know the problem with the

[47:00] service more stiff more stiff than a
[47:02] statue
[47:05] brother where's that excitement for
[47:08] Jesus we should be excited to come to
[47:11] the
[47:14] father this world has nothing for
[47:18] us this world has nothing for us at
[47:22] all the devil is going to try to make

[47:51] good out there it might look
[47:54] good but what's in here what's in here

[48:30] always dream of getting
[48:32] married that's that's that's how the
[48:34] youth think sometimes I know

[48:45] church every
[48:47] day you should be excited to come to
[48:49] church every
[48:52] day oh but Brothers there's always
[48:56] excuses to why we can't be excited for
[49:01] church you see some of us could
[49:04] say some of us makes excuses to why we
[49:07] distant ourselves from
[49:10] God you know sometimes we say oh the
[49:13] reason the reason I'm not that that
[49:15] close to God is because I'm going
[49:16] through things right
[49:20] now you know I'm dealing with I'm I'm
[49:22] stressed out I'm dealing with a lot of
[49:24] things

[49:29] guys went
[49:31] through Jesus went through that through
[49:34] that
[49:35] stress Jesus went through that
[49:39] pain Jesus went through
[49:42] everything but sometimes we can't come
[49:44] to
[49:46] church
[49:47] expecting because we are so closed
[49:51] up are so closed
[49:54] up God can't D

[51:03] in this
[51:05] age and youth we're going to go through
[51:08] pain we going to go through
[51:09] [Applause]
[51:11] trials go through stress
[51:14] and and we maybe we might think that no
[51:17] one might will never understand
[51:21] us Jesus understands
[51:23] us Jesus understands us
[51:27] clearly see CU
[51:29] Jesus he could have came
[51:31] down so that he could be
[51:35] served you see but he came down he came
[51:38] down as
[51:40] flesh he came down as a
[51:43] human to be like the likeness of
[51:47] man you see to be to serve
[51:51] others you see Brothers sometimes we try
[51:54] to serve our

[52:08] house we are in this we are in the

[52:16] opportunity this isn't like any other

[52:23] opportunity for you to have a reconcil
[52:25] with
[52:28] god let's not take this night for

[53:03] [Applause]
[53:10] Lord if you came expecting me to excite
[53:15] you you you're
[53:20] mistaken I believe that in these
[53:24] days we should be sensitive to the holy
[53:27] spirit for this
[53:31] fast the promises we made on this
[53:34] altar a new
[53:36] year a new
[53:40] beginning but as our brother Samuel
[53:45] said sometimes we're so cold like a
[53:49] statue the Revival is not in a group
[53:53] it's individual
[53:57] the word is
[54:00] spoken and now God has to do his
[54:03] job I'm just an
[54:05] echo and the pastor is an echo every
[54:09] minister is an echo we don't bring
[54:11] anything
[54:15] new we bring nothing that will give you
[54:19] Goosebumps if you came expecting
[54:21] something new brother and sister you'll
[54:24] leave
[54:27] appointed I come to bring a word with my
[54:30] brother
[54:31] Samuel that's the same yesterday today
[54:34] and
[54:38] forever can someone tell me the title of
[54:41] this
[54:49] night do we really know our
[54:52] father do you want to know him
[54:56] do you truly desire to know
[54:59] him are you here
[55:02] tonight or are you just focusing on want
[55:04] on my
[55:07] jackets we're GNA find out after
[55:10] tonight what truly you're focused
[55:13] on focusing on a
[55:16] man or you're focusing on your heavenly
[55:20] father let us go to Revelations 3:1 17
[55:26] apyp uh I'm not
[55:29] mad I'm
[55:32] just focused if I can
[55:36] say Revelations 3 chapter verse
[55:43] 17 because thou sayest I am rich and
[55:46] increased with goods and I have need of
[55:54] nothing and knowest not that thou are
[55:56] wretched and miserable and poor and
[55:59] blind and
[56:05] naked may God add blessing to his
[56:12] word we've come to the center of it
[56:16] all everything before that we've
[56:20] preached was just a
[56:23] shadow and everything after
[56:26] this point it back to the
[56:30] center who is Jesus
[56:32] Christ aren't you happy that we're
[56:34] talking about him
[56:36] now every person before
[56:40] him and
[56:42] after is him aren't you happy that all
[56:47] your life is surrounded of
[56:50] him because he wants you to know of
[56:53] him be so part of
[56:58] him that no one can
[57:01] see a line of separation
[57:05] between but he but the question
[57:09] is do you
[57:12] care do you care
[57:15] enough for the things of your
[57:18] father to matter to
[57:22] you we're talking about Jesus
[57:27] everything he did I believe was with
[57:31] purpose everything had a
[57:35] reason and just thinking on that a
[57:37] little
[57:38] bit the question to me
[57:41] came why do you say
[57:45] Amen why do you raise your
[57:48] hands why do you do what you do on a
[57:52] daily
[57:53] basis
[57:55] there has to be a a reason for
[58:01] it and many times I notice in the
[58:03] services of
[58:06] Youth I I I put myself amongst
[58:09] you many times I hear more amens from
[58:12] the
[58:14] adults than from the youth
[58:17] itself reason being that I I
[58:23] believe is when you say
[58:26] Amen brother brandham says it means so
[58:29] be it
[58:32] right all right it means that in other
[58:35] words you had either read
[58:39] it heard it or know it for you to say
[58:44] that
[58:47] amen cuz you're agreeing with
[58:51] that but many of us don't even know half
[58:54] the stuff they say up
[58:58] here especially
[59:01] youth for many years I would just say
[59:03] Amen because the neighbor said
[59:06] it I raised my hand because I saw the
[59:09] other brother do
[59:12] it I was doing things for no
[59:16] reason but it matter to Jesus
[59:19] Christ to know what he
[59:22] know yes we know he was the
[59:25] word he was the fullness of the
[59:29] word brother Bram says he's also was
[59:32] certain was limited to a certain
[59:35] point he says verely verily I verely
[59:38] verely the son cannot do what the father
[59:40] doesn't show him
[59:44] amen right
[59:47] amen so he was
[59:50] limited I'm trying to bring this in an
[59:52] angle for the
[59:53] Youth
[59:56] okay we're talking about Jesus
[59:58] now the center of it
[1:00:01] all and you're gonna tell me brother
[1:00:05] Gustavo that's
[1:00:07] Jesus okay and did he not send his
[1:00:12] Spirit The Same Spirit that was in Jesus
[1:00:14] is in us as
[1:00:16] well he pour out his spirit in the
[1:00:19] church so what's your
[1:00:22] excuse what my excuse not carry out the
[1:00:25] same
[1:00:28] acts look for the same
[1:00:30] things that Jesus Christ
[1:00:33] did at the same a at the age of
[1:00:37] 12 let that sink in for a little bit
[1:00:39] like my brother Sammy
[1:00:42] said age 12 I'm
[1:00:46] 25 and I'm barely understanding half of
[1:00:50] it and I'm barely caring about
[1:00:53] it what about
[1:00:55] you what about you do you care
[1:01:00] enough to know why you say amen
[1:01:04] for do you care
[1:01:06] enough to know what pleases your
[1:01:09] father what upsets
[1:01:12] him do you care
[1:01:15] enough to question yourself every single
[1:01:18] moment of your
[1:01:20] life to make sure that you're lining up
[1:01:22] with the
[1:01:23] word
[1:01:25] making sure that you're doing what
[1:01:27] pleases your
[1:01:31] father do I care
[1:01:34] enough be the
[1:01:38] question again we should be very
[1:01:42] sensitive to the Holy Spirit
[1:01:47] right these prayers that we're
[1:01:50] doing I thank God for
[1:01:53] this
[1:01:55] because it made me makes me really think
[1:01:56] about what I'm doing day to
[1:02:01] day
[1:02:04] care what my God is doing for me right
[1:02:07] now is he
[1:02:09] alive if so where in my
[1:02:13] life ask
[1:02:16] questions cuz many
[1:02:19] times we're just okay with being
[1:02:22] normal not knowing
[1:02:25] being
[1:02:27] natural but God wants us to be
[1:02:30] Supernatural us to know about
[1:02:33] him but we truly have to seek of
[1:02:38] it brother Brown says Jesus Christ is
[1:02:41] the perfect example
[1:02:44] amen age
[1:02:46] 12 he could have been partnering going
[1:02:49] on he could have been part of the
[1:02:53] party part of the
[1:02:56] celebration like our brother Samuel
[1:03:01] said he knew his
[1:03:04] purpose he said brother I don't know my
[1:03:07] purp I'm gonna make it very
[1:03:11] simple if one of your
[1:03:14] purposes to serve
[1:03:17] God then you're doing what's
[1:03:19] right that's one of your purposes
[1:03:22] serving God making sure that you're
[1:03:26] doing everything in your
[1:03:28] life everything in your
[1:03:30] power to make your father
[1:03:33] happy that's one one of our purposes in
[1:03:36] this
[1:03:37] life to serve our God let those
[1:03:42] know that don't know of
[1:03:44] him what he can do for
[1:03:47] them you are a living testimony believe
[1:03:51] that you are a living testimony
[1:03:57] I'm a simple
[1:03:59] person God is very
[1:04:01] simple don't over complicate
[1:04:04] it he's very simple
[1:04:08] Brothers I'm getting ahead of myself I
[1:04:10] had a lot
[1:04:13] of may it be God helping us
[1:04:17] tonight giving you exactly what you
[1:04:20] need do you truly know your
[1:04:23] father
[1:04:25] brother Bram says in the
[1:04:28] message the hand of the Lord come upon
[1:04:33] Him wow time really goes
[1:04:37] by he talks about right here about
[1:04:41] Elijah he couldn't see something till he
[1:04:43] got in the spirit of
[1:04:46] it I wonder how many are in the spirit
[1:04:51] tonight in in us right now more I I'm
[1:04:55] praying that God can dwell in us right
[1:04:58] now he says Elijah couldn't see
[1:05:00] something till he got in the spirit of
[1:05:05] it he says
[1:05:07] amen amen it means so be
[1:05:11] it you have to get into the spirit of it
[1:05:13] before you can see
[1:05:16] it now brother BR gives the example I'm
[1:05:19] going to jump a little
[1:05:20] bit he says how he says that he talks
[1:05:23] about how people when they go to
[1:05:24] [Music]
[1:05:27] dances you know they they have to get
[1:05:29] into the
[1:05:31] spirits they go to a football game
[1:05:33] basketball game
[1:05:36] whatever they have to get into the
[1:05:39] spirit we also need to get into that
[1:05:41] spirit
[1:05:44] amen but we have to want
[1:05:48] to care for
[1:05:50] it because there's so many voices
[1:05:52] brothers and sisters
[1:05:55] that just clog up our
[1:05:58] mind before coming
[1:06:01] here I don't know what you were
[1:06:06] doing but truly if it
[1:06:08] wasn't focusing on
[1:06:13] God you're not going to truly be able to
[1:06:15] focus on him
[1:06:19] entirely whether it be social
[1:06:22] media YouTube YouTube again I know I'm
[1:06:25] human I'm I'm youth as
[1:06:29] well I truly want to know my
[1:06:33] father I don't want this fast to be in
[1:06:37] vain I want it to be with a
[1:06:40] purpose I want to
[1:06:42] be better than what one than what I once
[1:06:47] was I'm sorry if I'm stuttering a
[1:06:51] lot I'm not a a fancy preacher if you
[1:06:55] can
[1:06:59] say I'm not I'm not going to tell you
[1:07:03] words that you want to
[1:07:05] hear I'm just going to Simply tell you
[1:07:07] what God gave
[1:07:09] me and I pray it be a blessing unto
[1:07:12] you that's my true desire
[1:07:15] tonight God help each and every one
[1:07:19] of know him more
[1:07:22] tonight more than we've ever known him
[1:07:27] before he says brother Bram
[1:07:30] says it says that's the reason you come
[1:07:33] around to the oldfashioned
[1:07:37] meetings where they got good
[1:07:40] salvation he got through hollering amen
[1:07:43] and praising the Lord you say a bunch of
[1:07:49] Fanatics you're just not in the
[1:07:52] spirit
[1:07:55] see if this is the holy
[1:07:59] spirit then that other must be the
[1:08:01] Unholy
[1:08:04] spirit this makes you do holy
[1:08:08] things that makes you do Unholy
[1:08:11] things I want to do holy
[1:08:14] things I don't know about you but I want
[1:08:18] that Holy Spirit to dwell in me more
[1:08:19] than ever
[1:08:22] tonight say after my father's
[1:08:26] business is my
[1:08:29] business I'm going to put myself in as
[1:08:31] an
[1:08:33] example my father owns a
[1:08:37] business and I am a
[1:08:40] son now if I go to the barber
[1:08:44] shop and I don't know what to
[1:08:48] do what to ask for how things
[1:08:52] wrong how do I expect to know what
[1:08:55] benefits I
[1:08:57] have what certain respect I should
[1:09:02] obtain Jesus Christ
[1:09:05] himself at a young age 12 years old in
[1:09:10] the temple three days and we can barely
[1:09:14] be sitting down for 25
[1:09:19] minutes and you want something
[1:09:21] Supernatural to happen right now
[1:09:25] you want something amazing to happen
[1:09:27] right
[1:09:29] now it's all in you brothers and
[1:09:34] sisters I can simply present the word of
[1:09:38] God and then it's you and God between
[1:09:43] there well you but I do believe there's
[1:09:46] someone that truly
[1:09:49] cares I'm not here to discourage
[1:09:52] you I want to wake you up a little
[1:09:56] bit New Year service is
[1:10:00] over you know the the
[1:10:02] Revival stayed behind
[1:10:05] there we need a daily
[1:10:08] Revival we have in our fire every single
[1:10:11] day and how can we do
[1:10:14] that caring about what our father
[1:10:18] wants in business of our
[1:10:21] father being in his word
[1:10:25] praying truly
[1:10:27] praying I'm going give you an example
[1:10:29] real quick about
[1:10:31] that brother brand talks about it in the
[1:10:35] message hear his
[1:10:38] voice I know I'm closing up right
[1:10:44] now but it says right here hear his
[1:10:49] voice he
[1:10:51] says he says L
[1:10:55] 35 but there's so many voices
[1:10:58] today that takes the voice of the Lord
[1:11:01] away from
[1:11:04] us and then he says there there's the
[1:11:06] voice of
[1:11:08] pleasure so many people are listening to
[1:11:13] that where they can go and have a good
[1:11:17] time and many of them are professing to
[1:11:20] be
[1:11:21] Christians some kind of rock and roll
[1:11:24] coming
[1:11:26] up they just can't listen to what
[1:11:31] God they say well I'm a
[1:11:34] Christian I read a verse in the Bible
[1:11:38] today yeah Jesus wept that that's it go
[1:11:44] ahead but then to really go down and
[1:11:50] pray they got too many other things to
[1:11:52] do
[1:11:54] there so many voices in the
[1:11:57] world so many things to attract our
[1:12:00] attention
[1:12:04] God I don't know about you brothers and
[1:12:07] sisters but I've also been a victim of
[1:12:11] that but I'm
[1:12:14] tired I'm tired of being the
[1:12:17] victim I'm tired of playing the
[1:12:20] victim poor
[1:12:22] me me oh my poor
[1:12:26] situation oh my family is

[1:12:37] had oh I don't have the church I wish I
[1:12:41] had I don't have the friends I wish I
[1:12:48] had and you tell
[1:12:51] me what was what was was Samuel's
[1:12:55] excuse what was David's
[1:12:58] excuse what was Jesus's
[1:13:00] excuse at such a young
[1:13:03] age Desiring to hear the voice of God in
[1:13:06] their
[1:13:08] day desing to do what pleased their
[1:13:11] father at such a young
[1:13:14] age to search the
[1:13:18] scriptures know why you say
[1:13:22] Amen why you believe in what you believe
[1:13:25] in and not just believe what someone
[1:13:28] else tells
[1:13:30] you it says it Jesus
[1:13:35] asked and and made
[1:13:38] questions he wanted to make
[1:13:41] sure make sure of what he
[1:13:47] knew you all know this book
[1:13:51] right why we believe in on Propet
[1:13:57] I I remember back when they used to have
[1:13:59] only
[1:14:01] books and and and the ministers had to
[1:14:03] search truly search for
[1:14:06] it and then go to the
[1:14:09] Bible and here we have a
[1:14:13] blessing our beloved Pastor made it very
[1:14:16] easy for
[1:14:18] us every
[1:14:21] scripture to prove to us
[1:14:25] and yeah we don't need we don't we just
[1:14:27] simply maybe a have it in our desk in on
[1:14:30] a
[1:14:34] desk maybe in in in our drawer in the
[1:14:37] back of our
[1:14:39] drawer not really
[1:14:42] caring not not
[1:14:44] caring we but I
[1:14:48] pray and I'm trying
[1:14:50] to put a little bit of reality in
[1:14:56] you this message stops when we
[1:15:02] stop this word stops when we
[1:15:06] stop we have to we have to make
[1:15:09] sure know what we
[1:15:11] believe I have to make
[1:15:14] sure know what I
[1:15:18] believe our pastor one day is going to
[1:15:20] fade
[1:15:22] away all these ministers are going to
[1:15:24] fade
[1:15:26] away and the next generation is
[1:15:30] up do you care
[1:15:33] enough to
[1:15:35] know what makes your father
[1:15:38] happy do you know what this message
[1:15:40] brought for
[1:15:42] us it's a restoration
[1:15:45] message message show us that Jesus
[1:15:48] Christ is in our
[1:15:51] day I have to make sure it's I care
[1:15:54] about it
[1:15:56] truly more than an
[1:16:00] emotion this is
[1:16:02] real as real as you want it to
[1:16:06] be please
[1:16:09] stand Jesus Christ is the perfect
[1:16:15] example and that
[1:16:18] spirit that was in him was put it into
[1:16:22] his church
[1:16:25] I'm not telling you anything
[1:16:27] new I'm just simply a
[1:16:30] reminder of what's been told to
[1:16:33] us time and time
[1:16:35] again but it's up to
[1:16:37] us as
[1:16:39] individuals not as a
[1:16:41] group but as an
[1:16:44] individual to really
[1:16:46] know where we're standing in
[1:16:51] today you can hear about God on social
[1:16:57] media you can hear about God about from
[1:17:00] someone
[1:17:03] else but how much of that is
[1:17:07] true it could be
[1:17:10] distorted my question is to
[1:17:13] you do you know the end time
[1:17:19] signs do you know what time you're
[1:17:20] living
[1:17:22] in
[1:17:23] are you aware of where you're at right
[1:17:27] now or are you just simply taking what
[1:17:30] I'm
[1:17:32] saying what your pastor
[1:17:34] says or what any other minister
[1:17:37] says you take it in your
[1:17:40] mind and once you step out those
[1:17:43] doors you don't do nothing with
[1:17:45] it you just let it blow
[1:17:49] out you don't make sure you don't go
[1:17:51] home and make sure
[1:17:55] that that's thus sayith the
[1:17:59] Lord you don't go home and make
[1:18:02] sure that that's in the
[1:18:05] Bible do you care
[1:18:08] enough why do you take
[1:18:11] notes in in in church if you just simply
[1:18:15] leave them in your
[1:18:17] Journal you don't care enough to go
[1:18:21] home truly
[1:18:24] and making sure to
[1:18:27] yourself This is th say the
[1:18:30] Lord we have to make sure
[1:18:33] church youth we have to
[1:18:36] make I'm in this with
[1:18:39] you but I want to make
[1:18:42] sure I know where I'm
[1:18:45] standing I know who my father
[1:18:48] is I want to make him as real in my life
[1:18:51] than
[1:18:51] ever

[1:41:06] Jesus interested in the

[1:41:16] feast we'll truly know if it was of
[1:41:19] God what we felt
[1:41:24] it will put an interest in us for the
[1:41:25] word of
[1:41:27] God it won't just leave us there at the
[1:41:32] feast jumping and the shou and the
[1:41:37] emotions it gives us a
[1:41:39] desire and an
[1:41:43] interest know of the word of
[1:41:46] God to know more of our
[1:41:49] father and if we don't have that
[1:41:52] desire it should be a sign for
[1:41:55] us it should be a sign for
[1:41:59] you Lord if I don't have that
[1:42:03] hunger is wrong with
[1:42:06] me help
[1:42:09] me because it doesn't just have to do

[1:47:11] things because you never
[1:47:14] know will be helping us with
[1:47:19] that
[1:47:20] also this
[1:47:26] Sunday this will be our second week of
[1:47:30] prayer and we want to bring
[1:47:34] letters if you want someone else to pray
[1:47:36] for
[1:47:37] you petition on your
[1:47:40] heart we could swap
[1:47:46] petitions somebody can pray for you and
[1:47:47] you can pray for
[1:47:49] them
[1:47:51] so you could have a
[1:47:53] petition the other person will read
[1:47:56] it sister and the brothers with the
[1:48:01] brothers don't put anything private
[1:48:04] in but that you would have someone to
[1:48:06] help you pray for
[1:48:08] that and the following week we pray for
[1:48:10] those
[1:48:12] things I found out about some
[1:48:16] things these days that I put the focus
[1:48:19] on the prayer
[1:48:21] I realize that that we don't like
[1:48:26] it we take it
[1:48:29] lightly I found out
[1:48:32] that there are people that that they
[1:48:34] don't
[1:48:35] care well Lord
[1:48:39] um it's a little bit
[1:48:42] sad it doesn't matter to us very
[1:48:46] much because if we need something more
[1:48:48] of it's more of a prayer
[1:48:51] and I find
[1:48:52] it that we pray very
[1:48:56] little and I find that we don't know how
[1:48:57] to
[1:49:05] pray the them was on how to
[1:49:07] pray going try to share that with
[1:49:10] you for those that
[1:49:13] haven't exercised in that
[1:49:16] area they don't like
[1:49:19] it
[1:49:20] you don't like it is because you don't
[1:49:21] know how to pray when you know how to
[1:49:23] pray you enjoy
[1:49:25] it it's a communion with your
[1:49:29] father you like to have communion with
[1:49:31] your father then what are we doing
[1:49:37] here amen
[1:49:39] Brothers
[1:49:41] what what is this about if I don't have
[1:49:43] I don't like to have communion with him
[1:49:45] amen amen
[1:49:47] Brothers well I hope
[1:49:50] that we take it more
[1:49:53] serious I understand there's Fellowship
[1:49:57] sometimes do it prior or
[1:50:05] after Daniel didn't just fast but he
[1:50:10] prayed that's when God answer
[1:50:15] fting spirits that don't come with don't
[1:50:17] leave with just a they leave with fting
[1:50:20] and
[1:50:21] prayer so both things are
[1:50:27] needed we I think God that we're finding
[1:50:30] out about these
[1:50:32] things it's better to
[1:50:34] know it's better to know something
[1:50:38] right to see if if we are if we're
[1:50:42] not if we're doing it right or
[1:50:45] not we should be so
[1:50:47] happy just as happy
[1:50:50] to know if we're doing it
[1:50:53] right or and or know if we're doing it
[1:50:57] wrong if we're doing it wrong then we
[1:51:00] have the opportunity to make it
[1:51:04] right assume or
[1:51:06] presume that we truly don't know
[1:51:10] about and if we're not doing it
[1:51:12] right I want to know I'm not doing it
[1:51:16] right yes or yes
[1:51:18] Brothers well
[1:51:20] very
[1:51:23] well this this Sunday you can bring your
[1:51:27] letter and we're gonna continue
