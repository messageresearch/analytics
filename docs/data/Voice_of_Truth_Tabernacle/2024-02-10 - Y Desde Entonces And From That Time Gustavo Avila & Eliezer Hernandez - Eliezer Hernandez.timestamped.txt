[26:12] 17 Matthew 4 verse
[26:17] 17 we give thanks to our God
[26:20] first beloved Pastor who allows
[26:26] us Matthew
[26:30] 4:17 and it says like
[26:36] this and from that time Jesus began to
[26:45] preach and to say repent for the Kingdom
[26:47] of Heaven is at
[26:50] hand tell your neighbor and from that
[26:56] time going to be praying in that
[27:02] manner beloved Heavenly Father we come
[27:04] before your
[27:07] presence I love the way your Prophet
[27:09] said
[27:12] it no one calls themselves an adult of
[27:16] the
[27:17] Lord but they're called a Son of
[27:24] God lord there's no one who's more or
[27:28] less than
[27:29] us we are all the same before your
[27:33] eyes not mattering our age
[27:37] father or how many years we might
[27:43] have you can use someone who is of an
[27:46] older
[27:48] age just as you can use someone who's a
[27:50] bit
[27:51] younger father put me
[27:54] aside use my brother
[27:59] and may it be a benefit to your bride
[28:00] this
[28:01] evening we give you
[28:03] thanks we put ourselves in your
[28:06] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus
[28:08] Christ amen
[28:11] amen you may have your
[28:15] seats this evening with the help of the
[28:17] Holy
[28:19] Spirit and with my brother
[28:25] hernandz we place this title
[28:29] and from that
[28:31] time again and from that time amen amen
[28:37] amen we're talking about the Lord Jesus
[28:40] still this
[28:42] evening I'm we be basing a lot of my
[28:45] thought off
[28:47] of two messages our Prophet preached to
[28:54] us and one of them is why are the people
[28:57] so tossed about why are the people so
[28:59] tossed
[29:02] about and the other is and from that
[29:07] time I believe that they're essential
[29:09] messages for the and for the adults
[29:16] Amen to see where we're at in our daily
[29:18] Christian
[29:20] walk and I recommend them for
[29:26] you I probably won't be able to finish
[29:28] everything I have in my
[29:30] heart brother
[29:32] BR brother BR but in the message brother
[29:37] brandham from that time he
[29:39] says and he gives many
[29:43] examples and he speaks on this scripture
[29:45] I just
[29:46] read and he takes it in this perspective
[29:49] this
[29:50] angle where he says and from that
[29:55] time brother BR says that every
[29:57] Christian or son or daughter of
[30:01] God they have one of those moments that
[30:03] it says and from that
[30:05] time
[30:07] whether good or bad they each have that
[30:10] moment brother brandham gives a few
[30:14] examples he says as as a young
[30:20] lady a lady that's of ill Fame you could
[30:23] say and she
[30:25] says there was a
[30:29] time that I I was a morally I was a good
[30:33] behavior I used to go to
[30:35] church and I I behaved
[30:40] good but brother Brandon says and on one
[30:44] night in a certain
[30:46] place something bad
[30:49] happened and that woman might be able to
[30:53] say and from that
[30:56] time and then she she went off the path
[30:59] she went on to a bad
[31:00] path and in the same way a
[31:03] youth brother Brom gives another
[31:08] example of a youth who lies to their
[31:11] parents for the first
[31:12] time I believe that each youth can
[31:17] remember when they would lie to their
[31:20] parents brother Bram gives his example
[31:22] of this
[31:23] youth that he says brother
[31:26] Bram
[31:29] brother BR I remember I was smoking a
[31:30] cigarette behind my
[31:33] house and I was there beside my
[31:37] chimney and I had a a cup of
[31:40] coffee and I drank that cup of
[31:44] coffee to cover up that cigarette
[31:47] smell I identify with that young
[31:51] man and the young man
[31:53] says and then I found myself with my
[31:55] mother and my mother told
[32:00] me and then she said blow breathe
[32:03] breathe in my face she she mother says
[32:06] to him and he breathes in her face
[32:09] mother smiles and she says
[32:12] hey you smell like coffee
[32:14] she are you trying to cover up something
[32:18] and the young man
[32:20] says in me he says something in
[32:24] me told me to tell her the
[32:28] truth but the youth says says he says no
[32:34] Mom promise I've never smoked cigarettes
[32:37] brother Bram and brother brandham
[32:40] says and from that
[32:44] time but when man finds himself with god
[32:47] brother it is
[32:49] different your neighbor it's different
[32:53] brother because brother brandham says in
[32:56] that same message if you can put it up
[32:59] on the
[33:02] screen is that fine if I preach the
[33:04] message to you this
[33:07] even I know that a Perot can do my
[33:10] job but it's need of the
[33:15] inspiration it's for you to see your
[33:17] life in this message
[33:21] word help you to change your journey to
[33:24] where you're
[33:25] going and the prophet
[33:27] says in the
[33:29] message and from that
[33:33] time in paragraph
[33:41] 24 but there's a time that where a man
[33:44] can come to something that's
[33:48] Eternal that's the time that a
[33:52] man that's the time the man meets God
[34:00] now he says that's when something
[34:02] happens that's Eternal do you
[34:04] believe is there someone here that's
[34:06] found themselves with God this
[34:09] evening that they have something Eternal
[34:11] inside of
[34:12] them now we're GNA get back to
[34:15] that if God helps
[34:20] us and this message brother Bram
[34:23] preached he preached it on a new year
[34:25] service
[34:29] and it wasn't too long ago that we had
[34:30] one
[34:31] another brother BR says in that
[34:33] message we make our
[34:36] mistakes and we make our vows on at
[34:40] [Music]
[34:42] night to only break them the next
[34:45] day and this is what I want to focus
[34:51] on and he says and we come to the
[34:55] Altar and turn new
[34:59] pages but all in
[35:09] vain for the next time somebody crosses
[35:12] our path or something that old temper
[35:13] will fly right back
[35:15] again I like what the prophet says
[35:19] there but there is a
[35:22] place tell your neighbor there's a
[35:25] place there a place the
[35:29] prophet can come to God on an
[35:36] occasion for God to change his eternal
[35:42] destination and he says he who comes to
[35:44] me I will not Cast Away do you give
[35:46] thanks to God that you can come to
[35:48] God no matter in your
[35:51] condition but is just simply to come to
[35:53] him brother brother say
[35:58] and his entire Eternal
[36:00] destination is
[36:03] changed say once again and from that
[36:06] time were you here this evening did you
[36:09] come to have church I don't know about
[36:14] you but I felt something with
[36:17] God and all of
[36:20] this I'm not just doing it for a
[36:23] show or just to cause something to look
[36:26] at
[36:30] I give thanks to God I was able to grab
[36:32] a hold andain it and this has helped
[36:35] me to see where I'm at in my life and
[36:38] that's why we come to church to see
[36:40] where we
[36:41] are too
[36:43] much too much on the left or the
[36:46] right this evening Amen brother brother
[36:50] Brandon
[36:55] says and a man can meet God and he can
[36:57] never be the same
[36:59] anymore now you probably ask
[37:02] yourself what is that place is it's the
[37:06] church is it the church is it to know
[37:09] more is it to know more of my Bible is
[37:12] it to know more the message or is it to
[37:15] behave good act is to have good
[37:19] morals because I
[37:21] believe that every person
[37:24] here has genuinely
[37:27] tried to get closer to
[37:31] God but I in the same way include
[37:34] myself we have our highs and
[37:38] lows and there's nothing wrong with that
[37:41] it's part of the Christian life but
[37:43] we're going to
[37:45] see and we give thanks for a
[37:49] messenger who gives us the breath of
[37:52] life gives us a
[37:54] breath a hope
[37:58] something can happen in our lives
[38:00] something
[38:01] better in the
[38:05] message why are the people so tossed
[38:07] about
[38:10] brother brother brand speaks on two
[38:12] different
[38:15] phases and that's what I want to focus
[38:17] on
[38:21] now he says now it's two different
[38:25] phases it's a better uh word to
[38:28] use not two
[38:31] types but two
[38:33] phases brother Brandon says in this
[38:37] message the same
[38:41] Christianity but two phases of
[38:45] it and one of them is an intellectual
[38:47] brother brandom
[38:50] says mental conception of what God has
[38:54] of what God is and the other
[38:59] it's an experimental
[39:01] experience and it is
[39:06] there that you have your moment of and
[39:08] from that
[39:10] time and God help me to explain it
[39:15] now that who he who is intellectual
[39:18] brother he is hungering
[39:22] brother he is feasting on
[39:25] God but his peace doesn't hold out
[39:28] brother brandham says isn't that
[39:31] tremendous he enjoys of God as we all
[39:36] do but his Feast doesn't last so there's
[39:40] a
[39:41] difference and the
[39:43] other the one with the
[39:47] experience brother Bram says that he has
[39:49] Victory after Victory nothing bothers
[39:52] him and in this same
[39:55] message brother brand speaks of a
[39:58] boat of how it has an
[40:02] anchor not mattering if the storm comes
[40:04] and hits
[40:05] it it's not the the boat that remains
[40:09] but it's the
[40:10] anchor that keeps in place that doesn't
[40:14] move that doesn't allow for it to move
[40:16] or
[40:17] sink and that is the
[40:20] anchor that is your an from that time
[40:24] that we have to have an
[40:26] an us to the word of
[40:29] God it does matter if they hit us from
[40:31] the left or the right we stay centered
[40:34] on God
[40:37] Amen and brother Brown says in the
[40:40] message the same message why are people
[40:42] so tossed about he says this he asked a
[40:46] question
[40:50] Lord what is it that these
[40:54] people those that have the experience
[40:58] have that the
[41:00] others those that are
[41:03] intellectual that they they pray so
[41:08] much and yet they fail to receive it
[41:13] remember it is the same
[41:15] Christianity but a different phase of
[41:18] it God help us this see to see where we
[41:22] are it's not nothing wrong for the
[41:27] person to be
[41:28] intellectual but there's
[41:31] something that brother Brown is trying
[41:32] to
[41:34] say more than just to know your
[41:36] scripture more than just to know the
[41:39] message than any ReliOn there
[41:43] is a genuine
[41:46] experience where you obtained your and
[41:49] from that
[41:50] time brother Bram and brother brandham
[41:55] says
[41:57] he says and I know that's a great
[41:58] question in our hearts who has come to
[42:02] Christ and he continues to
[42:05] [Music]
[42:09] say and he says and many of our
[42:15] teachers and schools have brought in so
[42:17] much the theology telling
[42:22] people saying well it's because you
[42:24] didn't shout because you didn't speak
[42:25] with Tong
[42:28] now I'm going to get into this a little
[42:30] bit we know that we have we have that
[42:35] here we don't have that here but perhaps
[42:37] you heard a brother or a
[42:39] sister they gave their
[42:43] testimony and how they received their
[42:46] experience there and from that
[42:50] time but brother R says that God is a
[42:52] god of
[42:53] variety God doesn't work the same with
[42:55] everyone
[42:57] and I hope that doesn't confuse
[43:00] you but God is not going to work in the
[43:01] same way with my brother VI he's going
[43:04] to work with
[43:05] me it is a genuine
[43:08] experience a firstand
[43:11] experience that only I and God
[43:13] have Moses had his experience of
[43:16] firstand his first
[43:18] experience Paul had his experience with
[43:20] the
[43:21] light each person had their end from
[43:24] that time a different way
[43:27] there are
[43:30] similarities but you have to have your
[43:31] own your own
[43:34] experience your firsthand exper it can
[43:37] be your dad your mother telling you or
[43:40] your pastor preaching to you but it has
[43:42] to be
[43:44] you for you to desire and from that time
[43:47] with God is that your desire this
[43:49] evening that that this evening it it not
[43:53] be just another
[43:55] night but for you to go back in your
[43:57] life 10 years have gone 10 15
[44:03] years to go by and by the grace of God
[44:05] we're still here and to be able to
[44:07] say in that youth
[44:10] service where brother
[44:14] gust the Holy Spirit came
[44:17] down that's where I my and from that
[44:21] time
[44:24] experience brother
[44:26] brother the brandom
[44:28] says with these two
[44:33] types he says now you have two different
[44:35] mental faculties all
[44:38] right he says you have one that's in
[44:41] your brain and one that's in your
[44:43] heart the intellectual part goes through
[44:46] your
[44:47] head and the experience goes through
[44:50] your
[44:54] heart he says now when the head begins
[44:57] to say
[45:00] something the soul wonders at it if it's
[45:02] not
[45:04] right but when it comes into the
[45:07] soul the head seems to step
[45:11] back I believe that's what we want this
[45:13] evening is to stop
[45:16] reasoning and just to believe
[45:19] God to believe his
[45:23] word he always tells us believe his word
[45:26] believe what God has said and
[45:29] yes I believe we genuinely
[45:31] believe but what is
[45:34] it that doesn't allow us to go
[45:39] further now I'm going to jump through a
[45:41] little bit because I don't have a lot of
[45:42] time left but now the time the question
[45:46] is what is it that happens in the
[45:49] heart that gives
[45:51] me my and from that
[45:54] time
[45:57] because it has to go through the heart
[45:58] we we know that brother BR said it it
[46:01] can't go through your head has to go
[46:04] down into your
[46:06] heart because that's where godes
[46:10] to that's where you have your encounter
[46:12] with God amen
[46:16] amen I know I might be telling you
[46:18] things you already know but it's good to
[46:21] remind
[46:24] ourselves brother Brown gives the
[46:27] example of the sister the man or the the
[46:33] Mana of the man that came down that was
[46:39] outside that brother Brown says everyone
[46:41] part took of
[46:45] it the multitudes of
[46:49] [Music]
[46:50] people and then we know that there's a
[46:52] Mana that's in the most holy
[46:54] place
[46:57] and and that's where it
[46:59] is that's where you find your end from
[47:03] that
[47:06] time remember that not everyone went in
[47:09] went in
[47:11] there everyone enjoyed of the manner
[47:13] that was
[47:15] outside and remember that the same
[47:18] Christianity but a different phase of
[47:21] it I don't know about
[47:24] you but I want to go going
[47:28] deeper it requires of more effort to go
[47:33] fur I give thanks to God that he tore
[47:35] that
[47:36] ve allow us to go into that most holy
[47:39] place the holiest of holies where we are
[47:42] now holiest of holies is where you are
[47:45] now where God finds your
[47:49] heart I probably won't be able to
[47:52] finish but go and read those messages
[47:58] there's no message that the prophet
[48:00] preached where it was in
[48:03] vain but I believe it was with all of
[48:06] his heart to be able to help the people
[48:10] what is
[48:12] it why do they always seem so
[48:15] happy and I'm forcing or trying my best
[48:18] day after
[48:20] day and it's like I can't understand
[48:23] like I can't anchor myself enough
[48:26] may God help us this
[48:28] evening brother Bram says the last the
[48:32] last
[48:35] quote the heart is the abot of
[48:38] God in the Old
[48:43] Testament God dwelt In His glory over
[48:45] the
[48:46] AR and the the heart is the
[48:50] AR God dwells not in the head in the
[48:54] heart
[48:56] God's not known by
[49:00] theology God's not known by mental
[49:03] conception I believe that this is god
[49:05] brother Bram
[49:07] says God's
[49:09] known by an old
[49:13] fashion Born Again
[49:15] experience an old fashioned Born Again
[49:19] experience and that
[49:22] sanctifies that is in the human heart so
[49:26] take this with
[49:27] you that new
[49:30] birth it can only go into your
[49:34] heart and how do I get it there brother
[49:37] Gustavo in your secret
[49:40] place when you're there kneeling with
[49:43] God when you undress yourself before God
[49:46] and you allow him to know all of your
[49:49] truth take out all that you have
[49:51] within all the ugly no one
[49:54] knows
[49:56] and that's where God wants to
[49:57] be to take all of that out so that you
[50:02] and
[50:03] him can have an
[50:06] experience and you can go back and
[50:08] see in your life and
[50:11] say and from that
[50:14] time I obtained my vict my victory with
[50:18] God God bless
[50:19] [Applause]
[50:24] you
[50:40] it's able to help the
[50:41] people brother Bram
[50:45] says the greatest
[50:47] privilege that a minister
[50:50] has preach the word of
[50:54] God that is the greatest privilege of
[50:57] minister to be to help the people
[51:00] through his
[51:01] word and it's the only thing we want to
[51:03] do brother we want to help the
[51:06] youth we want to help our
[51:09] children we want to help your children
[51:11] amen
[51:15] amen it's been a while now that I
[51:17] haven't spoken to the
[51:19] youth but I want to dedicate this
[51:24] message to all people all the
[51:27] youth who have not had their from that
[51:32] time who have struggled for a long time
[51:34] now with the same
[51:39] thing they have not been able to
[51:41] overcome certain
[51:43] things I want to dedicate you to this
[51:48] message if every single one of
[51:52] us have to get to that from that time on
[51:58] when we talk about from that
[52:02] time it's something that divides the
[52:06] present to the
[52:10] Past it's something that makes a big
[52:14] difference if you had the
[52:17] opportunity to go back in this this time
[52:20] to the to the
[52:24] Past and the exact
[52:26] moment that you made a
[52:30] mistake WIll you take advantage of that
[52:36] opportunity would take the the
[52:38] opportunity for God if God gave you
[52:40] that the opportunity to go back and pass
[52:43] and not make that
[52:47] mistake not even one of us would would
[52:49] not take advantage of
[52:53] that let me tell you this the
[52:55] opportunity is here
[52:57] now in this
[52:59] moment you have the
[53:02] opportunity to change the way of your
[53:05] life it's not in the hands of your
[53:08] pastor it's in your hands it's in my
[53:12] hands in the hands of every single one
[53:14] of
[53:18] us from that
[53:21] time we're speaking on the Lord Jesus
[53:27] and the greatest example a Christian
[53:29] has is the Lord Jesus
[53:35] Christ now the time was coming for the
[53:37] Lord Jesus Christ to have his
[53:40] ministry his ministry was going to
[53:47] begin but I go to the point where he was
[53:50] going to die in the
[53:54] calvary
[53:56] and I asked myself is it truly where he
[53:58] died at at
[54:00] Calvary he didn't die at
[54:03] Calvary where he died was
[54:07] in
[54:09] was preparation for what was coming
[54:12] ahead so we find Lord Jesus Christ
[54:15] here about to begin his
[54:20] ministry he already started his
[54:24] ministry
[54:28] many years behind he already
[54:30] started and as our youth already
[54:32] preached to
[54:36] us Jesus had a
[54:39] preparation Jesus had a
[54:42] preparation for the beginning of his
[54:47] ministry and the doing of
[54:51] Miracles and making water to
[54:54] wine that does not come from night to
[54:56] morning it has a
[54:59] process it has a
[55:01] process it has a
[55:03] preparation the preparation of
[55:06] Jesus we can see it from when he was a
[55:10] child since his
[55:14] childhood he would start to read the
[55:18] scriptures find him something that
[55:19] filled him from the
[55:24] scriptures he took many hours to read
[55:26] the
[55:27] scriptures speaking with his parents
[55:30] about the
[55:35] scriptures now we can be an hour and a
[55:37] half at
[55:38] church we don't even remember what the
[55:40] brothers
[55:42] preached we want to go look at our
[55:45] phon we want to go see our favorite
[55:49] series see the new movie that came
[55:54] out Christ Was preparing
[55:56] himself since he was a
[56:01] child he was also obedient to his
[56:05] parents obedience is something
[56:07] great obedience is something
[56:12] great he subjected himself to his
[56:15] parents like a youth preached to
[56:18] us he himself subjected to his
[56:21] creation he humbled
[56:23] himself to
[56:28] himself he was willing to
[56:31] obey to someone who was inferior to
[56:34] him think about
[56:37] that he obeyed to
[56:40] someone who was inferior to
[56:45] him now what is
[56:51] preparation the meaning of preparation
[56:53] is action and effect of prep
[56:59] preparing it says action that
[57:01] facilitates or reinforces the
[57:03] attack I'm G to repeat
[57:09] that it says an action that facilitates
[57:11] or reinforces
[57:13] theack if you don't
[57:15] prepare if you don't
[57:18] prepare the attack that comes to you
[57:21] will defeat
[57:23] you ourselves very defeated
[57:26] brothers because we can't
[57:29] Advance because we don't prepare
[57:33] ourselves that's going to
[57:35] war without
[57:39] preparation without knowing how to hold
[57:41] their
[57:42] weapon knowing how to fire their
[57:44] weapon knowing how to defend
[57:46] [Applause]
[57:48] themselves it's a sure
[57:53] death
[57:59] another meaning of preparation is carry
[58:00] out the necessary operation to obtain a
[58:03] product we need to prepare ourselves
[58:07] brothers look the child prepares since
[58:10] child to do something in
[58:15] life since child he said I want to do
[58:18] this of course there's many
[58:21] influences many things
[58:23] depend many things don't depend
[58:26] on depends on the
[58:30] influences but since childhood he he
[58:32] carries out a
[58:34] pattern and he says I want to be
[58:38] this I want to be an
[58:41] astronaut I want to be a
[58:45] pilot and he starts to prepare himself
[58:47] in his
[58:48] mind but he doesn't only leave it in his
[58:51] mind because things come in his life
[58:55] they will take him away from his
[58:57] objective but you know
[58:59] what with Jesus Christ it was not that
[59:02] way
[59:03] Jesus since child he was
[59:07] focused on fulfilling his
[59:10] purpose I'm gonna repeat that Jesus
[59:14] Christ since his
[59:16] childhood was
[59:18] focused fulfilling his
[59:23] purpose his parents forgot
[59:26] him they left him behind
[59:30] alone let our children be
[59:33] alone we don't know what's going to
[59:37] happen they left Jesus
[59:39] alone where did he
[59:42] go where did he
[59:44] go where his heart
[59:46] was where was his
[59:49] heart that's where he
[59:52] went that's where we should go
[59:55] the word of
[59:57] God you
[1:00:00] know they showed me a
[1:00:02] video this
[1:00:09] week of some of someone that I knew from
[1:00:11] my
[1:00:16] childhood I don't want to say if it's
[1:00:18] male or
[1:00:20] female but they showed me this
[1:00:23] video
[1:00:25] where they were inter interviewing
[1:00:31] them and he was in the
[1:00:36] streets he was lost in
[1:00:42] drugs and I knew him from my
[1:00:46] childhood I grew with him in the
[1:00:52] message and to see a Son of God in
[1:00:54] defeat
[1:00:56] it's the saddest thing there
[1:01:01] is this person would say in this
[1:01:07] interview they said many times we want
[1:01:09] to blame other
[1:01:11] people we blame them or this other
[1:01:16] person but what this person was
[1:01:19] saying is that truly it was their
[1:01:23] fault
[1:01:27] and we wouldn't want to see our
[1:01:29] youth is to be in a stage of
[1:01:35] defeat that would be like if that was
[1:01:37] our
[1:01:39] defeat we want to see our youth in
[1:01:43] Victory and the youth have everything to
[1:01:45] their
[1:01:45] reach to obtain the
[1:01:48] victory to come to that time that
[1:01:51] changes their life and let me tell you
[1:01:55] let me tell
[1:01:56] you that that moment will
[1:02:00] come you know human being
[1:02:06] children the devil prepares them from
[1:02:14] childhood did you know that Satan
[1:02:16] prepared something for you before you
[1:02:17] were
[1:02:18] born so that you would
[1:02:23] fail
[1:02:30] Satan is working with us since our
[1:02:33] childhood since our
[1:02:40] childhood brother bham says in in the
[1:02:43] message and from that time preaching
[1:02:46] 59 in paragraph
[1:02:53] 58
[1:02:55] we can all find something that that
[1:02:56] began in a certain
[1:03:00] time and from then on things has
[1:03:10] changed and many of us bring things from
[1:03:13] our
[1:03:15] past that we have not been able to get
[1:03:18] rid
[1:03:21] of something that happened in the past
[1:03:26] something has changed us in the
[1:03:28] past and we want to change for a long
[1:03:30] time now and we haven't been able
[1:03:35] to brother Bram
[1:03:39] says and there's other worthy things
[1:03:41] that we could think
[1:03:48] of man with good intentions has tried to
[1:03:51] start things a
[1:03:53] new
[1:03:55] to do things at a certain
[1:03:57] time paragraph
[1:04:01] 64 all these things are
[1:04:05] there there's a time when something
[1:04:10] happens and there's there's things
[1:04:12] brothers that happen that get in the
[1:04:14] Deep of your
[1:04:15] mind if you can't get rid of
[1:04:19] them they're going to disturb you for
[1:04:21] the rest of your
[1:04:22] life you don't fix
[1:04:25] Brothers it will disturb you for the
[1:04:27] rest of your
[1:04:29] life it will disturb
[1:04:32] you wife or your husband it'll disturb
[1:04:36] your
[1:04:38] children if you don't get rid of
[1:04:49] that and maybe all their vows in all the
[1:04:51] leagues of Nations so and so forth maybe
[1:04:53] had good int
[1:04:56] but they all came to an
[1:04:59] end all became crumbling beneath the
[1:05:02] feet of
[1:05:04] man with all the good intentions we
[1:05:06] could
[1:05:08] have but all must come to an
[1:05:12] end and that's a decision
[1:05:14] brothers that you have to
[1:05:17] take I can't take that decision for
[1:05:21] you I can't take the decision for my
[1:05:23] children
[1:05:25] them and every single one of
[1:05:29] us have to take our own
[1:05:37] decisions what took the Lord Jesus
[1:05:40] Christ was his own decision since from
[1:05:43] his
[1:05:44] childood to follow in the footsteps of
[1:05:48] God you think Jesus Christ had it easy
[1:05:53] Brothers
[1:05:55] think he truly had it
[1:06:00] easy Jesus Christ did not have it
[1:06:04] easy that means we also will not have it
[1:06:08] easy it won't be easy
[1:06:10] brother but it's our own
[1:06:13] decision to change your
[1:06:16] destiny it's not in the hands of
[1:06:23] anyone I dare to say it's not even in
[1:06:25] the hands of
[1:06:27] God it's in the hands of every single
[1:06:29] one of
[1:06:36] us so when Jesus
[1:06:39] Christ came to the beginning of his
[1:06:43] ministry he had already received the
[1:06:44] Holy
[1:06:46] Spirit he had already found his
[1:06:49] experience he had come face to face with
[1:06:53] God
[1:06:55] but the preparation that he had to come
[1:06:57] to that
[1:07:02] time was what brought him to that
[1:07:07] time you have to prepare yourself to
[1:07:09] come to
[1:07:13] service you have to prepare yourself for
[1:07:19] service we want things easy
[1:07:22] Brothers
[1:07:26] want an a fairy to come
[1:07:29] out and

[1:09:40] 50 he says this U story about this
[1:09:47] elder you imagine become older of

[1:10:10] point you say have to come to this
[1:10:13] time I have to come to with my
[1:10:15] experience with
[1:10:18] God paragraph
[1:10:22] 84 there was this

[1:10:33] decision the devil kept beating him out
[1:10:35] of
[1:10:37] it one day out in the
[1:10:41] field he nailed down to
[1:10:43] pray while he was
[1:10:46] praying he drove down a St he

[1:10:52] memorial

[1:10:59] star I'll tell
[1:11:02] you that right here I met
[1:11:06] God and it was settled from here

[1:11:26] of thousands of them and next
