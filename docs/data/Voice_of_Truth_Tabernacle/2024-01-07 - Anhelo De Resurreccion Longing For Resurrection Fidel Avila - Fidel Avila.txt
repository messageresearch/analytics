all of us glory to God can you hear me now glor glory to God subject with the coming of the Lord on Sunday morning speak of a topic the Lord has put in my heart we will title it longing for Resurrection The Script says there were certain Greeks among those who had gone up to worship at the festival these therefore came to Philip who was from beida and Galilee and besought him saying Lord we would like to see Jesus how many want to see Jesus this morning morning if you came to see Jesus you will not leave disappointed I guarantee that Jesus answered them saying the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified truly truly I say to you unless a grain of whe falls into the ground dies it remains alone but if it dies it Bears much fruit he who loves his life will lose it and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life let's jump to 27 now my soul is troubled here's the Lord Jesus speaking and what will I say father save me from this hour but for this I have come to this hour I'd like for you to repeat with me but for this I've come to this hour pray Heavenly Father Lord we ask you in this morning you come and take control of the scene take control of the audience take control over me and you allow this useless man you come and use my lips lip of my interpreter this morning your word of life because it's what gives life it's what encourages us it's what keeps us to be standing in this morning in this place Lord your word never fails thank you Lord we ask these things in the name of Jesus Christ you may take your seat Brethren this morning don't be too quiet with me because if you're quiet I'll be quiet but if you help me preach we can say the preaching is easier for the preacher when you also get into the spirit this morning the lord gave me this simple thought longing for Resurrection I was thinking we're starting a new year we finished the old year and I've been meditating what people are longing many people during Christmas are longing for many things many people long for great gifts they were longing for good gifts but those gifts the person was expecting it wasn't the gift they expected many people this morning this day they're longing for something you sitting there this morning you're Desiring something now my question is what are we Desiring the subject is the coming of the Lord we're talking about the resurrection what do we desire why don't we get up this morning and begin to long for what does our heart long for this morning what did we want to come we desired to come to church I know many are brought but what do we come to church for what do we come looking what do we long for this morning my heart what does my heart desire this morning I want to find out and if there's a desire in my heart I want a deep that will answer this morning if inside you there's a desire that will answer to that desire that's crying out I didn't come to waste my time this morning I Wednesdays and Fridays with the youth helping them that's not the purpose there's something Beyond there's a higher life said this is not it is not it there's something higher there's a higher life that's what I long for that's what I long for what I long for in this morning it's the resurrection that's what we're waiting for not waiting for we're Desiring for Resurrection because when we can see them means the Lord is here here were these Pharisees remember the title is longing for resurrection and ask yourself this morning I've been asking myself all week what are you doing in church what is your desire I've spent so many years in church and what is your desire just keep coming serving singing hearing his word Fidel what is your desire what is your desire this morning what do you want I'm not happy the way my life is miserable if I will ever be happy because my God is Limitless the life I have now is not enough there's something more else somewhere else that makes me desire to come more to church so hear his word more and Die daily did you know dying to yourself is not easy it's easier that someone kills you for you to kill yourself the Lord Jesus was right there the hour came and he said Lord if it's possible make this trial pass but because he knew that to die to yourself is not easy like I said it's easier to kill your brother now you don't kill your brother uh backstabbing or shooting them a prophet of God came and told us if you want to kill your brother kill his influence and what are we doing we criticize we judge them we're killing our killing their influence that's the way we it's not no more we kill the influence of our brother kill your brother's influence you are killing yourself sooner or later won need that brother kill his influence it won't have the same effect anymore how they can say Amen have you not realized sometimes I haven't done anything to the brother to the sister nor I know them no they know you's bitterness against because someone poisoned them you paid attention and someone infected us but here were these Greeks you know the Greeks were theologians they weren't just any type of person how we they were prepared men and here they come along they tell Phillip pH Phillip we'd like to see your lord now to want to see the Lord there's nothing wrong with that right but it also counts the way you approach him there can be a desire in my heart but the way I will approach him that's what matters here they were pH philli we would like to see the Lord can we see him and the Lord Jesus answers this Jesus answered saying the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified and the Lord says truly truly I say to you unless the grain of whe falls into the ground and dies now if you're following me this morning I want you to follow me they're asking can we see Jesus and the Lord Jesus is answering look if you don't die there won't be fruit in you there's no life in you what does one thing have to do with the other these Greeks want to see you and you're telling me I have to die because the time comes brother that we come to church we come here our beautiful beautiful preaching go home we hear the prophet and we begin to feel ourselves we feel ourselves and the hour comes where we are left blind that's where they were how many times isn't the Church of the Lord the same blind there's no desire in her do you know I say it for myself dying isn't easy crucifying yourself is not easy here the Lord is saying if you do not die there's no life in you because the worst enemy is in you and we've heard it a million times I bet but very few times we've meditated over that that truly the enemy is in our home the enemy is in our home the enemy is not outside it's in our home both seeds are in here tells us that Jesus and Judas attended the same church what does the word longing mean a desire is something that is desired intensely let's be sincere this morning I said I was going to be simple I'm not going to speak too high what does the word longing mean to desire something intensely in this morning ask ourselves are we longing for the resurrection in do we long for the resurrection do we long to see our Lord Jesus Christ in see God's wonders and do we want to see Jesus if we want to see Jesus he can come to the SE all that's stopping him is you we are stopping you can't see Jesus on he wants to heal he wants to heal you from your he wants to hear you more from your soul because in the soul the soul is the problem the problem is in the soul you cannot live without desires that's what the word along means you cannot live without desires you know the same scripture is telling us the Lord Jesus is saying here but for this hour I have come he knew his purpose he knew what he come for this morning do we know what we came for do you know what we come for he knew he knew that if he did not die you and I could not partake now to us it's our turn to do a job to do the problem is that we won't do it because we haven't died to ourselves and if we die we die only to a part how many can say Amen to that you know why this is getting good let's do it easy when we get close to the pastor and we ask for advice do we do it that's simple right do we follow his advice or okay or we walk out the office we take off and we want to have good results just because we spoke with the pastor the medicine was you need to take so there's a result if you don't take it it's difficult for a result to be in that's why we come to a church dragging ourselves sometimes we don't even want to come don't want to do anything less longing the resurrection if we barely come to church brother Isaac less I long for the resurrection less I'm longing for the holy spirit in ISAC let me tell you something this morning I got news if you I and them aren't born again don't have the Holy Spirit don't expect you will not attend the resurrection because the Holy Spirit what will prepare you because that's what he's coming for he comes for himself comes to take himself to long for in this morning it's the Holy Spirit that's why we're dead in life that's why the word of God has no that's why the word of God is spoken and that's why many of us are facing everywhere else the preacher can kill himself here our pastor can die up here but if we don't die if you and I do not die to ourselves that desire we have if we do have a desire if we have one it has to be a genuine one and I believe you have it otherwise you wouldn't be seated in church there's something that brought us there's a deep there's a deep that's pulling this deep in this morning if you feel that pole interrupt the Holy Spirit allow him allow him doesn't matter who is here here maybe brother Fel is the most sinful of everyone but if he could use an ass if God can use an ass why can't he use me and you the Holy Spirit work in you work in every one of us our Pastor said and the message death brings Resurrection he preached with brother Eric in 2021 we come to church as if we already had everything I don't know if you can identify this morning right we do not come desperate we do not come with those tears our we come as if we already they come just like those firstes who invited the Lord Jesus Christ to their house but they never washed his feet we invite the Lord we're so busy and what do we have to do when we leave we're so busy in everything we're thinking other things we're thinking about tomorrow who told you you'll live tomorrow who told you live another hour if someone told you they lied to you who told you you live longer that's a devil's lie amen they never washed his feet sometimes we invite the Lord here and we're so cold that we don't welcome him how he deserves since we come in from those courts we have to let go of ourselves to sayel I'm gonna crucify you just for this while stay here control him brother you have control the Holy Spirit control these feelings all the for for you to control the Beast [Music] inside but the problem is instead of crucifying ourselves out there we leave the Holy Spirit out there the prophet says is that right he says they leave the ho Holy Spirit on a branch out there and then we come in here just to fight and we're longing for the resurrection this is ABCs our pastor says they never kiss [Music] him they never saw his great need their own need now this morning I want you to ask yourself this here our pastor is saying they never saw their own great need have we seen our need this morning I believe how they said on Friday we're in a fast we need to be a little more spiritual sensitive to the spirit they never saw their own great need that's why they couldn't humble themselves they were more concerned about fulfilling a program than the need in their hearts how many times do we come to [Music] church and we don't truly search our heart we aren't searching for that medicine that can truly make that surgery in your we come with a mentality very we don't come with a mentality saying what will my beloved tell me those of you who are married I don't know I don't know if you remember when you were recording and our phone rang and it was Sister Raina there was a longing in my heart but the time comes it's the same the natural typifies the spiritual the time comes that we have them in our home and how it cost how it cost us to tell them hello how are you when at some time we desire to hear his or her voice didn't you desire to hear the voice of the one that's your husband now was there not something in your heart that was ping a desire for that young man young lady but the time comes where there's a coldness I remember when I began to hear the prophet I listen to message after message after message that's right but a coldness began to sit in my life devil always the devil always he's always watching us he watches you 247 and the devil knows how to get to us and you already have your husband your wife in your home forgive me I don't know why the Lord is leading me this but a a coldness comes to your life you wake up and not even a good morning I'm not sure if I'm speaking to anyone because we're worried for the day's program and a stiffness came to my heart am I can't say Amen anymore the pastor is dying here preaching you and we're just watching somewhere else there's a coldness that gets in your heart brother brandham says this are you willing to die how many are willing this morning that's why I said it's not easy to die so we can obtain what our heart longs for the Lord has giving us the key if you want to see Jesus you need to die to yourself it's no longer you it's no longer me it's no longer that's ruling me because I haven't died to myself I still I still don't that's why there's a coldness in because I haven't died to because now in this moment going through this fast feel spiritually better because you have crucified your flesh and you've said flesh today Facebook today you won't listen to subject and you feel better you are surrendering your the holy spirit is working in you one time Clos one time brother Bram was traveling on a plane and he met this woman said I can't understand why a young lady with a personality personality like yours has to do a thing like this she was smoking she said oh I get satisfaction from doing it what satisfies us what satisfies us this morning ask yourself what satisfies me your husband your wife will not satisfy you your children won't satisfy [Music] you young ladies young men won't satisfy you woman as much as you try they can't only God can but we don't want that we want to fill that desire with wrong things we don't spend time how do we want to sa feel that satisfaction you can't I said that's only a satis a sub substitute satisfaction if you would just receive what I tell you and give your life completely to God there's something you're lacking Our Lives lack this morning that's why we come very Fallen because we're Desiring and we don't know what that is I don't know what that is can you stand I don't know what your desires this morning I truly don't know but I know someone that does because when I had that longing in my heart when I was lost brother when I was in the clubs when I was doing things I shouldn't be doing there was a longing in my heart there was a desire and that desire would tell me there's a higher life look this is not everything there's something else something higher there's a more glorious there's a more glorious when your life is falling to everything is fall around but inside you there's a desire a desire that's crying out for something else there has to be an answer there has to be an answer our brother Bron would say there was a child that would eat erasers do you remember that St story and he would eat them and he says inside that child he needed something in this morning if we lack something don't leave [Music] brotherr don't leave don't leave without receiving Lord on now that's true Hallelujah I can never give it to you our pastor he can't give it to you sometimes we have an attitude of not expecting anything when he is looking at us Jesus is looking at [Applause] us and he sees the deficiency in your soul in my soul and he says son daughter why not ask why are you dying son and daughter you don't have to be that way your life can be different your marriage can be different your children can be different your children can live a higher life you can live a higher life you can live a a higher life if there's a desire in your life if something is crying out for that it is here in this morning let us pray father [Music] father forgive me Lord because I'm guilty of these [Music] things how many times have I invited you to my [Music] home and I haven't washed your [Music]
