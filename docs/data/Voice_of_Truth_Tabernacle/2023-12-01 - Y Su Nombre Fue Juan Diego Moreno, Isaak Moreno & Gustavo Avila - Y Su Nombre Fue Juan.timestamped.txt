[27:17] foremost for this
[27:22] opportunity if you can open your
[27:24] scriptures with
[27:26] me
[27:28] to the Book of
[27:33] Luke
[27:36] verse with an amen we can go ahead and
[27:38] read
[27:42] it amen and it reads like
[27:46] this but the angel said unto him fear
[27:50] not Zacharias for thy prayer is heard
[27:53] and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a
[27:56] son and thou shalt call his name
[28:11] John if we can bow our heads to
[28:15] pray dear God gracious Heavenly
[28:19] Father Lord we give you thanks father
[28:21] for another opportunity to be
[28:25] here Lord we just ask you speak to us
[28:29] tonight and that you just come Lord
[28:31] Jesus and just have your way with us in
[28:33] this
[28:36] service guide us father may we just be
[28:39] able to receive Words of Life this
[28:43] evening thank you Father we put the
[28:46] service in your hands in the name of the
[28:47] Lord Jesus
[28:51] Christ amen amen you may be
[28:55] seated amen
[28:58] we're going to be talking about a new
[29:03] character we're going to be speaking on
[29:05] John the Baptist
[29:09] now amen he was a tremendous man used by
[29:14] God and I believe that we can learn a
[29:17] lot from him
[29:20] amen amen um there was a brother in the
[29:22] back
[29:24] room that he said it'd be a good idea
[29:29] but to remind the
[29:31] youth that these Bible
[29:35] stories they're not just
[29:38] stories it's not just a fairy
[29:42] tale or just a history
[29:45] amen but these are brothers and
[29:49] sisters and they're people that we we
[29:51] can learn from
[29:55] amen amen
[29:58] amen so John the
[30:00] Baptist when you see
[30:03] John you see that John had two
[30:07] parents but John's
[30:11] father he was
[30:14] old as was his
[30:17] mother and you find that John's father
[30:20] was also a
[30:24] priest and in those times that was a
[30:27] great office to
[30:33] hold amen and The Story
[30:36] Goes that Zacharias went to go do his
[30:39] Priestly duties in the
[30:45] temple and he he's uh approached by an
[30:50] Angel Gabriel goes to
[30:55] Zacharias and he's given the the
[30:57] prophecy that John is to be his son
[31:04] amen but now I find this part
[31:09] interesting because although
[31:13] Zacharias being a
[31:16] priest when he was given the
[31:19] prophecy he doubted
[31:22] amen amen amen and the Bible says that
[31:25] he lived a righteous life
[31:29] amen and and because he
[31:33] doubted he was struck mute until the day
[31:36] that John was born
[31:40] amen amen in the in the way that I want
[31:43] to look at this
[31:47] tonight is that when we as
[31:51] Christians when we doubt God's
[31:55] word we we can't can't express ourselves
[31:58] freely about
[32:01] it I don't know if you guys have been
[32:03] able to experience
[32:06] that but when I read
[32:09] this it really touched me
[32:12] amen I don't know if you guys have had
[32:14] experience with that but when someone
[32:15] tries to talk to you about the
[32:19] word and and you can't really hold a
[32:24] conversation and sometimes a lot of
[32:26] times it's because you struggle to
[32:27] believe
[32:31] it a lot of times I like
[32:35] zaras what what he looked at was the
[32:40] difficulty he tried to understand God's
[32:42] plan
[32:45] amen amen but that's not we ought to
[32:47] just believe God's
[32:52] word I like what Charles Spurgeon says
[32:55] concerning this
[32:58] Carlos he says this he says if a good
[33:02] man was struck dumb because of his
[33:09] unbelief what will become of you who
[33:11] have no faith at
[33:15] all praise be to God if that doesn't
[33:17] speak to anyone that speaks to
[33:21] me amen so you see that from the
[33:25] beginning that John coming into the
[33:29] world it was a work of
[33:32] God even just leading up to John's
[33:37] birth there were a lot of obstacles in
[33:40] the
[33:41] way his parents were
[33:45] old his mother was
[33:48] Barren and his father struggled to
[33:51] believe
[33:53] amen amen so we see that John's life was
[33:56] filled with with obstacles from the
[34:02] beginning it was a struggle just for him
[34:04] to be
[34:09] born so I asked who who here is fighting
[34:12] to be
[34:17] born amen not too many of
[34:20] us amen and if we're not fighting to be
[34:25] born I don't know if you know this but
[34:27] in the
[34:29] story John was a
[34:36] stillborn amen so if you're not fighting
[34:38] to be
[34:40] born then you're a still
[34:44] born amen and you need to start
[34:48] fighting if you want your new birth
[34:52] amen amen praise be to
[34:55] God
[35:03] a lot of times the
[35:06] reason that we are stillborn or find
[35:09] ourselves in a stillborn
[35:13] condition or or find it hard to believe
[35:16] the
[35:18] word is because we look at the
[35:22] circumstances and it stops US it keeps
[35:26] us from going
[35:28] forward we base we base our
[35:32] faith based on what our natural eyes can
[35:37] see on our problems on our trials on our
[35:43] tests even our failures a lot of times
[35:47] amen amen but God didn't give us our
[35:50] circumstances to go
[35:54] by he gave us faith in
[35:57] amen and what is faith faith is the
[36:01] evidence of things hoped
[36:05] for and the convictions of things you
[36:08] can't
[36:10] see
[36:13] amen I want to share a quick
[36:17] testimony and I think it has a lot to do
[36:20] with
[36:23] this amen um while I was in school
[36:28] they told me I wasn't going to get hired
[36:35] anywhere because I didn't have this kind
[36:37] of license that that um that you need to
[36:40] get
[36:44] hired and throughout like it was
[36:48] constant they just told us oh if you
[36:49] don't have that license you're not going
[36:50] to get
[36:55] hired I'm like well I mean I guess I'm
[36:57] not getting
[37:02] hired amen and then uh I got
[37:06] home and I told my dad well I'm probably
[37:09] not GNA get
[37:12] hired and he told me just
[37:16] apply and he told me just quit looking
[37:18] at the negative and and just
[37:22] apply amen and uh well I applied and a
[37:27] week went
[37:28] by then two weeks went
[37:31] by and then it was two days ago three
[37:34] days
[37:35] ago I got a call for an
[37:39] interview so I was like oh well I mean
[37:42] doesn't hurt to try
[37:44] right so I went over
[37:47] there and I got to the
[37:50] interview and they were like telling me
[37:52] about the
[37:55] job like if I already had
[37:57] it they weren't interviewing me they
[38:00] were just almost like giving me the
[38:04] job so they didn't they didn't like
[38:07] really interview me was a
[38:11] thing so I was all right
[38:13] then and then yesterday I got the call
[38:16] that that I got the job
[38:20] amen but the crazy thing is
[38:24] this is that there was three of us from
[38:26] my school that got
[38:31] hired two of us two of
[38:34] them they had the license
[38:38] amen I didn't have the
[38:42] license but they said that they were
[38:44] going to help me get
[38:47] it maybe maybe it might not have been
[38:50] God but I believe it was God
[38:53] Amen I believe that God takes care of
[38:55] his children amen
[38:58] amen that I believe that no matter what
[39:00] people tell you in this
[39:04] life if you listen to
[39:06] that then you're going to stay a
[39:08] stillborn
[39:10] amen there's no life there amen but if
[39:14] you hear the name of
[39:18] Jesus because it wasn't until John heard
[39:21] the name of
[39:24] Jesus that there was life in that womb
[39:28] amen it went from
[39:32] Mary it went from Mary to
[39:35] Elizabeth Elizabeth and then from
[39:38] Elizabeth they went to John am
[39:41] Elizabeth so it just goes to show the
[39:43] power that is in the name of
[39:47] Jesus Amen I believe that when John
[39:50] heard the name of his
[39:54] cousin I believe that there was a life
[39:56] that was produced inside of
[40:00] him there was an identity
[40:03] amen because John's
[40:07] purpose was for him to till the soil for
[40:09] his
[40:12] cousin so I think that there he caught
[40:14] the
[40:17] Revelation he caught the purpose for his
[40:22] life amen and I believe that if we hear
[40:24] Jesus's voice today
[40:29] that we also can catch the purpose that
[40:31] God has for our
[40:34] lives amen don't let anybody tell you
[40:36] who you
[40:38] are don't let anybody tell you what you
[40:40] can
[40:43] do because remember it's never been
[40:46] us it's he that is in US
[40:50] amen amen the Bible says in first
[40:54] John chapter 4:4
[40:58] it says year of God little
[41:02] children and have overcome
[41:05] them because greater is he that is in
[41:10] you than he that is in the world
[41:13] Amen there is a greatness in every one
[41:16] of you
[41:18] you that has to come
[41:21] out if
[41:23] John he never did a miracle
[41:28] but he was the
[41:30] miracle and brother brandham
[41:32] says he says if you want to see a
[41:36] miracle you first have to be that
[41:38] Miracle
[41:40] amen so if
[41:42] John being just one
[41:45] man he was just one
[41:48] man and God used him in a mighty
[41:52] way that just gets me to
[41:55] think what if it was Samuel and
[41:58] heido if it was Melissa and
[42:02] Ruby if every one of these
[42:05] youth had the same experience as
[42:09] John and what kind of an impact would
[42:11] that
[42:14] have brothers they're still talking
[42:16] about John
[42:18] today they still talking about John
[42:20] today and he was one man
[42:23] Brothers there's no telling what God do
[42:26] if you just let yourself uh you just let
[42:28] him uh live in you
[42:32] amen if you just let him get his hands
[42:35] on you
[42:36] amen amen that's all I have can come
[42:40] forward God bless
[42:47] you amen I'm very happy to be in the
[42:50] house of the
[42:52] Lord amen I'm very proud of my
[42:55] brother
[42:56] had a good four months over there with
[43:01] him where we really had to grow up
[43:04] amen we didn't have our parents no
[43:08] more we didn't have someone to tell us
[43:10] to get
[43:13] up we had to wake up early
[43:16] too 5:50 at least every
[43:21] morning to get to school around 7:15
[43:25] 7:30
[43:28] and you see we're talking about John now
[43:32] here and it's said and we titled this
[43:35] and his name was
[43:39] John you see Dale was talking a little
[43:42] bit about his
[43:45] parents and a little bit about John
[43:48] amen but I kind of want to get
[43:51] into a little bit more of what he was
[43:54] talking
[43:55] about
[43:56] when he was talking about how he how he
[43:58] was dead in the womb
[44:02] still you see I I I found this
[44:06] quote in
[44:08] experiences preaching in
[44:12] 1947 and it says and the first time that
[44:15] name was ever spoke by mortal
[44:21] lips went into the ears of a
[44:25] mortal
[44:27] a dead baby and the mother's and and the
[44:31] mother leaped for Joy question
[44:38] mark John the Baptist is that right
[44:41] question mark
[44:44] [Applause]
[44:45] again it was six months without
[44:50] life received
[44:53] life then as soon as these words
[44:56] come into
[45:00] her her babe leaped for
[45:05] joy and if it'll make a dead person leap
[45:08] for
[45:11] Joy what ought it do to one that's
[45:14] already
[45:17] alive you see what ought the name of
[45:19] Jesus got to do to someone say that
[45:21] again what the name of Jesus got to
[45:24] do to someone that is
[45:28] alive imagine a dead
[45:32] baby not even
[45:35] born dead in the
[45:37] womb you see a lot of the times we're
[45:39] dead here at
[45:42] church I speak for
[45:44] myself I've been there in the
[45:46] [Music]
[45:48] Pulpit wanting to raise my hand the
[45:51] bench yes go ahead wanting to raise my
[45:54] hands wanting to say
[45:57] Amen wanting to say
[46:00] hallelujah praise my
[46:03] God but too worried about what the
[46:05] person next to me is going to
[46:08] [Applause]
[46:09] think too worried about if I stand
[46:14] up and
[46:16] rejoice because God is working in
[46:19] me what is my brother next to me going
[46:21] to
[46:23] say what are the girls going to think
[46:25] amen
[46:27] a lot of the times we we we're just here
[46:29] because the girls
[46:32] here we're just here because after
[46:37] service I'm gonna talk to
[46:41] her a good
[46:44] conversation we're gonna talk about what
[46:46] we're going to do next
[46:49] week talk about anything you
[46:51] know you guys
[46:54] know
[46:56] and you know it's exciting it's
[46:58] something
[47:00] natural but that's not why we should be
[47:02] coming to the house of the
[47:05] Lord we should be coming to the house of
[47:07] the
[47:08] Lord to get a renewing in our
[47:11] life the Holy
[47:14] Ghost born
[47:15] [Applause]
[47:19] again you see I was um hearing something
[47:22] earlier
[47:24] today hold on my mouth's getting
[47:31] dry you see we came to have church
[47:35] today amen it's a little dead out there
[47:37] but it's
[47:39] okay we're still going to preach
[47:42] am you see I read something and it
[47:47] said you are being
[47:51] planted but you feel as if you are being
[47:54] buried
[47:57] you see there's no
[48:00] difference in the
[48:02] motion of planting
[48:05] something and bearing
[48:08] something see when you plant a
[48:11] seed you dig the dirt
[48:14] right and you put the dirt back on or
[48:16] the
[48:19] soil and when you bury
[48:22] someone you do the same thing you dig in
[48:25] the dirt
[48:28] you put them in there and you're done
[48:30] right but the difference
[48:32] is when you plant that
[48:35] seed that seed it dies right but not
[48:40] only does it
[48:41] die but not only does it have to
[48:44] die but once it's dead and it
[48:48] rots it comes to
[48:51] life those roots start going down into
[48:53] the soil
[48:54] right
[48:56] and you might not see what's happening
[48:58] you don't see what's happening under the
[49:01] dirt Elizabeth might have not know what
[49:03] was
[49:05] happening she didn't know what was going
[49:08] on her baby was
[49:10] dead that's all she knew right but she
[49:14] knew that there was life inside of
[49:16] her every single one of
[49:19] us have that
[49:21] seed have that life inside of
[49:24] us see you could either be a dead person
[49:27] buried into the
[49:30] ground or you could be a
[49:33] seed and you see as time
[49:37] passes that seed starts coming out into
[49:41] the outside
[49:44] amen and what are you going to show on
[49:46] the
[49:47] outside what kind of fruits are you
[49:49] going to
[49:52] portray amen amen
[49:56] I want to read another
[49:58] quote
[50:00] um and it's in the
[50:04] message as the eagle stirreth up her
[50:08] nest you know if a baby's born and it
[50:12] don't
[50:15] cry it don't it don't
[50:18] squ they don't do
[50:21] nothing that baby's
[50:23] dead that's what's wrong that's what's
[50:26] the matter with the church
[50:29] today we've got too many still born
[50:33] babies see a lot of us are
[50:36] dead a lot of us haven't come to
[50:40] life a lot of us haven't realized
[50:44] what what time we are living
[50:48] in we are living in the end
[50:50] time and it's just going to get harder
[50:53] and
[50:54] harder and if you don't surrender
[50:58] yourself if you don't give
[51:00] yourself it's just GNA get harder and
[51:04] harder if you don't try to put an effort
[51:06] into
[51:08] it into reading your
[51:11] Bible and so you know just five minutes
[51:14] is all it
[51:16] takes you see I you you read things here
[51:19] and
[51:20] there sometimes workout things pop up on
[51:23] my on my phone
[51:30] or one time I did a a
[51:35] quiz and at the end of the
[51:38] quiz it says as long as you do five
[51:41] minutes a day of
[51:45] exercise you still can get to your
[51:48] goal when you think about
[51:51] that they like five minutes of
[51:54] exercise I'm still going to get to my
[51:57] goal it doesn't sound possible it it
[51:59] sounds
[52:01] impossible but when you get five minutes
[52:03] just to the
[52:05] Lord everything's possible
[52:08] amen he could do so much in those five
[52:10] minutes of your
[52:12] life you change your life like
[52:17] that and I want to kind of get into when
[52:22] um John went into the desert
[52:27] you see the Wilderness is not a a
[52:30] comfortable place to be
[52:34] in see there's
[52:37] storms
[52:39] bushes um
[52:41] snakes wild
[52:44] animals going going
[52:46] right you see but that's where he
[52:50] was see he was in a comfortable
[52:53] place he wasn't at his home
[52:57] relaxing he wasn't even in a place like
[53:00] this we're privileged to have a place
[53:02] like
[53:04] this to have the pastor we
[53:06] have the ministers we have
[53:09] here he didn't even have
[53:11] that a nyear old out in the
[53:15] wilderness by
[53:17] himself imagine
[53:21] that and a 19yearold like
[53:24] me
[53:27] can't even be left
[53:29] alone because we don't know what he's
[53:32] going to do
[53:34] amen the nature of
[53:39] man when you don't have
[53:42] god you're worse than an animal
[53:44] amen the prophet
[53:47] says but you see he wasn't in a
[53:49] comfortable situation
[53:51] right he wasn't on his couch relaxing
[53:53] watching Netflix
[53:57] he wasn't connected to the
[53:59] Wi-Fi Wii he was prob in heat he was in
[54:04] heat eating
[54:06] Locust
[54:09] wildy you see and a lot of times we want
[54:13] to stay in our comfort
[54:15] zone we always want to be
[54:19] comfortable we don't want to be
[54:22] uncomfortable you see we're too busy
[54:24] connecting Ed to other people's
[54:28] lives on social media on our
[54:32] phones
[54:35] Sports instead of connected to Jesus
[54:39] amen we know more names of sports
[54:44] players we know more of people's
[54:47] lives than we know the name of
[54:50] Jesus you see what we know more of what
[54:53] someone else could do for us
[54:58] than what Jesus could do for us
[55:01] amen and you
[55:03] see to grow with
[55:07] God we have to go into uncomfortable
[55:12] situations you see John the
[55:16] Baptist when he was in this
[55:21] Wilderness all he was doing is getting
[55:24] prepared
[55:26] to bring the word to the people
[55:29] right to
[55:31] repent you see and a lot of times God
[55:35] wants to put us in that
[55:37] situation alone in the
[55:39] wilderness away from all all
[55:43] distractions from all
[55:46] friends even from your parents
[55:49] sometimes from your brothers
[55:52] everything because it's just a
[55:53] one-on-one with Jes with
[55:57] God he wants you he wants to put you
[56:00] through the
[56:02] test so you could
[56:04] grow but a lot of times we just want to
[56:06] stay
[56:09] comfortable you see the
[56:11] disciples when they went through the
[56:14] storm they were in an uncomfortable
[56:18] situation but that was the only way they
[56:20] were able to see what Jesus was able to
[56:23] do
[56:26] how he could liberate him from the
[56:31] storm and you see they weren't doing
[56:33] anything wrong
[56:36] either they were in God's
[56:38] Will and a lot of times we might be in
[56:41] God's
[56:43] will but he's going to put
[56:45] you in that storm in that
[56:48] Wilderness in those hard
[56:52] situations to show you what he could
[56:54] really do
[56:58] amen amen and you see a lot of times
[57:00] we're put in uncomfortable
[57:04] situations and we start to
[57:07] complain oh this is too
[57:10] hard you see being in school I wanted to
[57:12] quit a lot of the
[57:16] times not because I didn't like
[57:20] it I actually enjoyed
[57:22] it I wish I would have started it
[57:28] sooner as many of you know it was a
[57:30] quick
[57:33] decision but
[57:35] anyways it wasn't something that because
[57:39] it was something
[57:43] hard
[57:45] like not that I didn't want to do the
[57:49] job of course we had physical
[57:53] labor but was just when you go somewhere
[57:58] else it's something hard
[58:01] amen when you don't have your parents
[58:05] there and sorry
[58:08] Brothers but when you don't have them
[58:11] there or you don't have your pastor
[58:14] there and you finally realize what you
[58:21] had it's really hard amen it's you see
[58:25] we we had some brothers over
[58:27] there and they were of great
[58:30] help but it's not the same amen it's not
[58:33] the same to have your pastor by your
[58:37] side to be able to text him
[58:41] whenever and he be there for
[58:43] you or have your parents by your
[58:47] side and they be for there they be there
[58:49] for
[58:50] you or have the brothers that you
[58:53] love and they' be there for you
[58:57] amen it's not the
[59:01] same but we couldn't whine about it
[59:05] amen me and had to support each
[59:09] other through every single
[59:12] thing I had to support my
[59:16] brother you know I never thought I was
[59:18] going to have to not protect him because
[59:21] I know he could protect
[59:23] himself
[59:28] I never thought I was going to be in
[59:30] the in a place where people were
[59:32] bullying them amen and the sense
[59:40] away telling him why he doesn't drink or
[59:44] smoke and you know my brother's a little
[59:46] on the quieter side
[59:49] amen yeah he'll speak up when he has
[59:52] to but he usually kind of stays quiet
[59:56] and so it was nice to see
[1:00:00] him and me kind of be a big brother to
[1:00:04] him but not only be a big brother to
[1:00:08] him but have a younger brother next to
[1:00:11] me and protecting me as well
[1:00:15] amen but what I wanted to
[1:00:20] say is no matter how much you whine
[1:00:23] about these situations
[1:00:27] that you're so
[1:00:30] uncomfortable you see because a lot of
[1:00:32] times we get
[1:00:37] lazy now I'm sorry to say it but a lot
[1:00:40] of our youth are
[1:00:45] lazy and I'm I'm I'm saying I'm putting
[1:00:48] me in there as
[1:00:49] well I'm lazy as
[1:00:51] well we get lazy amen
[1:00:55] we don't want to
[1:00:57] work we want to just stay
[1:00:59] home and have our parents do everything
[1:01:01] for
[1:01:04] us we even get upset because they don't
[1:01:06] do things for
[1:01:09] us because they don't give us a
[1:01:12] phone because they don't give us money
[1:01:14] to go
[1:01:16] out they don't let us take the car
[1:01:20] out you see and we're whining about all
[1:01:23] these things
[1:01:26] but you see when you why no one's going
[1:01:28] to show up for
[1:01:31] you see the only one that's going to
[1:01:33] show
[1:01:34] up is going to be the
[1:01:36] devil and he's goingon to be laughing at
[1:01:39] you because you're gonna see how
[1:01:41] miserable you
[1:01:44] are how miserable of a Christian you are
[1:01:47] how miserable of a Christian you
[1:01:51] are see the only one that's going to be
[1:01:53] showing up to that wine party or that
[1:01:54] crybaby party whatever you want to name
[1:01:58] it you're going to have one
[1:02:02] guest that's going to be the devil amen
[1:02:05] that's the only guess you're going to
[1:02:06] have
[1:02:07] there no one likes cry
[1:02:11] babies you see when a baby starts
[1:02:16] crying what's the first thing usually
[1:02:18] parents
[1:02:19] do what's the first thing can a parent
[1:02:22] answer that
[1:02:27] see a lot of people either tell them to
[1:02:28] be
[1:02:30] quiet or now we have
[1:02:32] these we just say
[1:02:34] here and quiet some
[1:02:37] right but you don't want to hear the
[1:02:39] crying
[1:02:40] right no one likes cry
[1:02:43] babies you see
[1:02:45] youth it's time to grow
[1:02:48] up you see being over
[1:02:50] there we grew up a lot I
[1:02:53] believe
[1:02:55] and I might not be M more mature than
[1:02:57] most of
[1:03:01] you but what I do
[1:03:04] know is that we do have a lot to growing
[1:03:07] up to
[1:03:09] do and if we don't grow up
[1:03:14] soon we're just G to get lost
[1:03:17] amen if we don't
[1:03:19] mature if we don't stop with these kids
[1:03:22] these kid things that we have
[1:03:26] he's
[1:03:27] complaining he's hiding
[1:03:31] things these things that we do as
[1:03:36] kids because that's what we really are
[1:03:38] you
[1:03:39] know when we're doing those things when
[1:03:42] we're doing those
[1:03:43] things you see God is more concerned
[1:03:45] about your
[1:03:49] development than your
[1:03:52] comfort he not too concerned about how
[1:03:56] comfortable you
[1:03:59] are and I just want to leave you with
[1:04:03] this it's time to get into uncomfortable
[1:04:08] situations to grow more with
[1:04:11] God because if we
[1:04:13] don't you could pass
[1:04:16] brother because if you
[1:04:18] don't there's not going to be any
[1:04:21] success if you're in the same
[1:04:23] comfortable situ
[1:04:27] situation you see everyone already knows
[1:04:29] I play the
[1:04:31] base there's nothing surprising about
[1:04:35] that but when you see another born child
[1:04:37] of
[1:04:39] God people see the difference
[1:04:42] amen when you get out of your
[1:04:44] comfortable after your comfort
[1:04:47] zone you see when I see a a little kid
[1:04:50] or
[1:04:52] something when I see these kids
[1:04:57] Alden Abraham Abraham singing and
[1:05:01] ushering and raising their
[1:05:04] hands it makes one sad
[1:05:08] amen because we can't even do that as
[1:05:10] older people
[1:05:12] am even sometimes as
[1:05:16] adults as
[1:05:19] myself you see we can't even give our
[1:05:21] hearts to the
[1:05:23] Lord
[1:05:25] and that's why it says in the Bible
[1:05:27] amen you know children are they're
[1:05:29] easier to give their hearts to the
[1:05:33] Lord your heart as youth
[1:05:37] amen but I just want to say that
[1:05:40] brothers and I hope this helped
[1:05:42] you and it's just time to get out of our
[1:05:44] comfort
[1:05:47] zones to start doing
[1:05:49] something that we're not used
[1:05:53] to to get closer to
[1:05:56] him God bless
[1:05:59] [Applause]
[1:06:10] you and his name was
[1:06:14] John can you say it with me and his name
[1:06:17] was
[1:06:18] John amen what a tremendous
[1:06:22] man God bless you
[1:06:27] I wanted to greet the inlaw Eric God
[1:06:31] bless you amen amen John Juan now to
[1:06:36] start to think about
[1:06:39] John you can't avoid thinking about his
[1:06:44] parents I'm gonna go back a little bit
[1:06:46] of what my brother Isaac just
[1:06:50] said God is it matters to God your
[1:06:53] development
[1:06:57] if you're growing or
[1:07:00] not if you're alive or
[1:07:03] not because if we start to
[1:07:07] think if
[1:07:09] Elizabeth the mother of
[1:07:12] John had paid
[1:07:14] attention to all the voices
[1:07:17] outside to her own voice maybe
[1:07:22] saying there's no there's nothing going
[1:07:24] on inside of
[1:07:27] me he's not
[1:07:29] moving I believe that she may have given
[1:07:32] had an
[1:07:35] abortion and many of us have spiritual
[1:07:38] abortions here in
[1:07:41] church just because we don't see things
[1:07:43] moving the way we want
[1:07:47] it
[1:07:49] dead we think things in our life are are
[1:07:51] messed
[1:07:52] up
[1:07:54] and we think that it cannot be
[1:07:57] fixed but that's where you're
[1:08:00] wrong you may
[1:08:02] say I have
[1:08:04] failures I've done this and
[1:08:07] that I seem
[1:08:11] dead I look
[1:08:13] dead oh but if you can just
[1:08:16] listen one time to that name Jesus
[1:08:21] Christ only that name
[1:08:24] only that
[1:08:25] life can give you life once
[1:08:28] again don't listen to the outside
[1:08:32] voices the voices that say give
[1:08:35] up stop you've done enough you messed up
[1:08:42] enough you keep on messing up again and
[1:08:46] again
[1:08:48] abort abort it no sir but thanks be to
[1:08:53] God
[1:08:55] that Elizabeth didn't pay
[1:08:58] attention to those voices that said
[1:09:01] it if it wasn't for
[1:09:03] that Elizabeth stayed
[1:09:07] strong and stuck to the promise that the
[1:09:10] angel of God said to
[1:09:13] her and to
[1:09:15] Zariah oh we wouldn't have this great
[1:09:19] John what a great character
[1:09:22] amen a great example for us
[1:09:25] youth to show
[1:09:28] us it doesn't matter how old you
[1:09:33] are brother Bram says that
[1:09:35] John went into the Wilderness at nine
[1:09:38] years old
[1:09:41] amen and just again the
[1:09:45] importance of John needing to come on
[1:09:48] the
[1:09:51] scene because before John
[1:09:55] it had been over 400 years the prophet
[1:09:57] of God
[1:09:59] says until a true Prophet had came
[1:10:04] before all right the people's condition
[1:10:07] was so
[1:10:09] dark was so
[1:10:12] confused they were so needing of a voice
[1:10:15] in the
[1:10:18] wilderness and now think about your
[1:10:21] day how much we needed a voice to come
[1:10:24] to our
[1:10:26] time the voice of Elijah in our
[1:10:30] time to bring out our
[1:10:34] parents out of the
[1:10:37] denominations to bring out our
[1:10:39] parents out of the world and where we
[1:10:43] you and I
[1:10:45] youth can be where we're at right
[1:10:49] now it's a miracle of God that you and
[1:10:52] are here
[1:10:54] it's no
[1:10:56] coincidence how God brought your
[1:10:59] family working your mom or
[1:11:02] dad to bring you and me
[1:11:05] here a
[1:11:08] message that can only bring True
[1:11:10] Deliverance in our
[1:11:13] lives and a message that shows
[1:11:17] us what that name Jesus can do in
[1:11:21] us there a life again because if there's
[1:11:24] a
[1:11:25] life I would love to
[1:11:28] have would be like
[1:11:31] John's his life was already
[1:11:32] predestinated for
[1:11:35] him it was already planned out from the
[1:11:37] day when he was
[1:11:40] born even before he was
[1:11:43] born I don't know how many out there
[1:11:45] would like
[1:11:47] that I don't know about you I would like
[1:11:50] that where someone would tell me
[1:11:54] Gustavo this is your calling this is
[1:11:57] your purpose this is how you're going to
[1:11:59] do it and here is what's going to help
[1:12:02] you wouldn't you like
[1:12:05] that you can have that you can truly
[1:12:09] have that
[1:12:10] tonight because the same holy spirit
[1:12:12] that John
[1:12:14] had it's the same holy spirit that you
[1:12:17] and I
[1:12:19] have that guided
[1:12:22] John that
[1:12:24] guided that kept John in the
[1:12:28] wilderness and that's the crazy thing
[1:12:30] about
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:33] it the crazy thing about
[1:12:37] it he was n years
[1:12:41] old Abraham can you please stand up
[1:12:44] abrah look at Abraham Abraham how old
[1:12:47] are
[1:12:49] you right
[1:12:51] there oh holy spirit
[1:12:55] guiding him to the
[1:13:02] Wilderness think about that
[1:13:04] church can you step into the picture
[1:13:06] right now can you get out of your
[1:13:08] comfort
[1:13:10] zone coming to a I just came for a
[1:13:13] Friday regular
[1:13:19] service I'm going to go
[1:13:21] home enjoy time with my
[1:13:24] family and I'm going to stay the
[1:13:27] same I don't want to stay the same I
[1:13:30] don't want to stay the same in this
[1:13:32] cruel dark
[1:13:36] Wilderness cuz it's so
[1:13:38] [Music]
[1:13:40] key what John
[1:13:43] had when he was
[1:13:45] born he was filled with the Holy
[1:13:48] Ghost and when he was in the
[1:13:51] wilderness brother brother brother Isaac
[1:13:54] said brother Bram says that a man
[1:13:57] without the holy
[1:13:59] spirit is worse than an
[1:14:03] animal what if John went into the
[1:14:05] Wilderness without the Holy
[1:14:08] Spirit what if you and I go into the
[1:14:12] world you and I go out of our
[1:14:16] houses out of our parents' eye
[1:14:21] view without the Holy Spirit
[1:14:25] ask yourself youth we would be worse
[1:14:27] than
[1:14:29] animals I recognize it
[1:14:32] first I'm the first
[1:14:34] one I know how much I need the holy
[1:14:36] spirit in my
[1:14:39] day because this world is so
[1:14:42] dark so
[1:14:44] confused and it's only been 58
[1:14:48] years since the prophet of God has
[1:14:51] left imagine John's
[1:14:54] time so
[1:14:57] important so
[1:14:59] important it was for
[1:15:01] John to
[1:15:03] Listen and
[1:15:05] Obey and concentrate
[1:15:08] himself cuz con
[1:15:13] consecration
[1:15:15] separation brings
[1:15:18] Revelation I'm going to say it again
[1:15:21] consecration separation
[1:15:24] brings
[1:15:25] Revelation and and again you can't stop
[1:15:28] to
[1:15:30] think John's greatness didn't consist of
[1:15:33] a great
[1:15:36] Miracles he just brought a a message of
[1:15:41] repentance only softened up the
[1:15:46] ground but there was nothing if you can
[1:15:48] call it great to the human
[1:15:52] eye
[1:15:55] but it wasn't
[1:15:57] John it wasn't
[1:16:00] John it was what was in
[1:16:04] John to making him do what he was
[1:16:09] doing it was not
[1:16:12] John when he came out of the womb of his
[1:16:16] mother and it's no longer you and
[1:16:19] I when we
[1:16:22] allow the Holy Spirit come inside of
[1:16:26] us do you want that
[1:16:28] church you do you truly want
[1:16:31] it it's here for
[1:16:36] you cuz many many and thanks be to God
[1:16:39] for a
[1:16:41] message cuz there's too much of
[1:16:46] me and not enough of
[1:16:49] him I'm GNA there's a quote that brother
[1:16:52] bam there
[1:16:54] the resurrection of
[1:16:57] Lazarus this again this is so important
[1:17:00] church youth how important it is to have
[1:17:03] the Holy
[1:17:05] Spirit because many
[1:17:07] times the devil tries to trick
[1:17:11] us with an
[1:17:14] emotion instead of an a true experience
[1:17:16] with
[1:17:18] god brother bam says in the message the
[1:17:21] resurrection of Lazarus if can please
[1:17:23] put it
[1:17:26] up and he says and now notice what kind
[1:17:30] of baby was this to
[1:17:31] [Music]
[1:17:34] be out in the Wilderness at 9 years
[1:17:38] old and here's the key
[1:17:41] thing and
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:17:46] staying if I was
[1:17:49] John after the first night I would have
[1:17:51] already ran home
[1:17:54] if John's experience was based on an
[1:18:01] emotion he would have never remained
[1:18:03] those 20 plus years in the wilderness
[1:18:08] alone if we
[1:18:10] base our Christian lives off of an
[1:18:16] emotion we're not going to last long
[1:18:19] here we're not we're going to start to
[1:18:21] listen to The Voice that tell
[1:18:25] us you've done this you've done the
[1:18:28] other you've Hur this person you've hurt
[1:18:32] that
[1:18:33] person I just see you messing up time
[1:18:36] and time
[1:18:38] again no I see
[1:18:42] you you're probably
[1:18:45] right you're probably 100%
[1:18:49] right I'm not
[1:18:51] perfect no one's perfect
[1:18:55] ISF but thanks be to God I don't
[1:18:58] base I'm not here based on those those
[1:19:08] things years ago I would have ran
[1:19:11] [Music]
[1:19:12] away thanks be to
[1:19:15] God that there's that
[1:19:18] voice in the back of my
[1:19:21] head
[1:19:24] saying I'm not done with you
[1:19:28] yet you're not
[1:19:30] done I still have something for
[1:19:34] you you may seem
[1:19:37] Dead Oh but once you hear my
[1:19:41] name
[1:19:43] Jesus then something's going to really
[1:19:47] happen I'm sick and tired of L feeling
[1:19:50] an
[1:19:51] emotion I'm s tired of just feeling a
[1:19:54] chill on my
[1:19:57] back I want something
[1:20:00] real I want something real like John
[1:20:03] had kept him in the
[1:20:07] wilderness
[1:20:08] holy kept them
[1:20:11] together kept them
[1:20:14] prepared because the Holy Spirit had to
[1:20:17] keep them
[1:20:20] prepared for what was to to come later
[1:20:22] on
[1:20:24] that's what God wants to do with us
[1:20:27] church he want to do with you wants to
[1:20:31] prepare you for later
[1:20:34] on we may not understand it
[1:20:36] now but our purpose is later on many
[1:20:39] other
[1:20:40] times it's
[1:20:42] coming the promise is it's been
[1:20:46] made it's just that we believe
[1:20:49] it that that promise is for
[1:20:51] us the Holy Ghost was sent for
[1:20:55] who the Holy Ghost was sent for
[1:20:58] who for me for you to do the works of
[1:21:02] God on this
[1:21:03] Earth because like a brother
[1:21:06] said like a brother said you may
[1:21:10] be you may be the only
[1:21:15] contact for
[1:21:18] someone of
[1:21:21] God
[1:21:26] you can be the closest
[1:21:33] thing the closest thing they see to
[1:21:39] God but many of
[1:21:41] us our hearts are full of
[1:21:46] Callis you know what a call
[1:21:50] is and I'm closing up
[1:21:53] it's a thick and hardened layer of
[1:22:00] skin a a Heart of Stone if you can
[1:22:09] say let's just go quickly to
[1:22:13] Ezekiel because how many have felt that
[1:22:16] they have a a Heart of
[1:22:20] Stone feel like you feel
[1:22:23] nothing I I I I've been cold for so
[1:22:28] long I feel like I've been dead for so
[1:22:33] long but listen to what Ezekiel
[1:22:37] say
[1:22:42] 3626 a new heart also will I give
[1:22:48] you I will give
[1:22:51] you a new spirit will I put within
[1:22:57] you now look at what is
[1:22:59] coming he he doesn't say I'm going to
[1:23:02] polish up the old
[1:23:05] Hearts he will say I will take away the
[1:23:07] Stony
[1:23:11] hearts out of your
[1:23:14] flesh and I will give you on an heart of
[1:23:20] Flesh a a promise
[1:23:23] that he will take that Heart of
[1:23:26] Stone and if you allow him to do
[1:23:29] it he will put a heart of
[1:23:33] Flesh a heart that pleases him to dwell
[1:23:38] in cuz that was the
[1:23:41] key that's the
[1:23:43] key he needs a heart of
[1:23:47] Flesh something
[1:23:49] soft something so sweet and kind
[1:23:57] it doesn't amaze me
[1:23:59] why it does not amaze
[1:24:02] me why he was able to use a
[1:24:04] nine-year-old
[1:24:07] kid and fill them up with the Holy
[1:24:11] Ghost I know I say that as a
[1:24:14] joke you know where it says only the
[1:24:17] when I say oh only the children will
[1:24:19] inherit the kingdom of heaven right
[1:24:21] don't
[1:24:25] right when many people say oh you act
[1:24:27] like a kid brother
[1:24:31] Gustavo I am a kid but I also many times
[1:24:35] some people
[1:24:37] forget how to have that type of Faith a
[1:24:40] kid
[1:24:42] has to Simply listen to The
[1:24:46] Voice not listen to your
[1:24:49] reasoning not listening to your doubt
[1:24:53] but simply
[1:24:55] listen simply
[1:24:57] listen to what God wants for you in your
[1:25:02] day please
[1:25:06] stand how important it is to have the
[1:25:08] Holy Ghost in our
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:12] day how important it
[1:25:15] is to have that same
[1:25:18] reaction like John
[1:25:21] had when he heard the voice of the name
[1:25:24] [Music]
[1:25:29] Jesus I don't know if there's someone
[1:25:30] out
[1:25:32] there I've been there where you come
[1:25:35] service after
[1:25:38] service and it feels like the same thing
[1:25:40] again and again and
[1:25:44] again you feel like you haven't done
[1:25:47] much this
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:25:49] week maybe you haven't done enough
[1:25:53] but you want to do
[1:25:55] something or maybe you've messed
[1:25:58] up you were doing
[1:26:02] good I don't know where you messed
[1:26:05] up it's okay it's all
[1:26:08] right that's why we're
[1:26:11] here this is a
[1:26:14] hospital this is a there's no saint
[1:26:17] [Music]
[1:26:19] here we're just a bunch of sinners
[1:26:24] saved by
[1:26:26] grace and if you just listen to that
[1:26:28] [Music]
[1:26:30] voice not the devil telling
[1:26:32] [Music]
[1:26:34] you listen to
[1:26:38] God telling you I want
[1:26:41] more I want more of
[1:26:43] you I want to use
[1:26:46] you just like I did to
[1:26:48] John so
[1:26:51] simple
[1:26:53] let that be our prayer
[1:26:56] tonight let that be our Earnest
[1:27:02] prayer I don't know if you want
[1:27:04] something real
[1:27:06] tonight but what John
[1:27:09] had it's right here right
[1:27:13] now gracious Heavenly
[1:27:16] Father your word has been
[1:27:19] spoken the prophet of God said
[1:27:23] that it the one of the hardest things to
[1:27:27] do was that a mortal believe another
[1:27:33] mortal May
[1:27:35] tonight my brothers and sisters and
[1:27:38] I set our mindset
[1:27:43] aside put our Stony heart in your
[1:27:48] hands and let you put a heart of Flesh
[1:27:54] so we can start to listen to
[1:27:57] you in
[1:28:00] Simplicity CU you still dwell in the
[1:28:05] man that's hard to
[1:28:08] believe because we see the exterior of
[1:28:11] the
[1:28:13] man we see his
[1:28:16] life but if we could put aside
[1:28:20] that put our
[1:28:23] OS whatever
[1:28:26] side and believe the
[1:28:30] promise I have no doubt that you will
[1:28:32] move
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:35] tonight in the name of our Lord and
[1:28:38] Savior Jesus Christ we
[1:28:42] ask amen
