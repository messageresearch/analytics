[15:32] [Music]
[15:37] Hermanos God bless you brother problems
[15:42] you've probably already seen what's on
[15:44] my head
[15:47] significa but knowing what it means
[15:50] it's God upon us
[15:56] and I liked how our Pastor said let's be
[15:59] a little different yeah
[16:01] [Music]
[16:26] and that's to preach in Spanish
[16:30] and it's something I believe every
[16:33] person is
[16:38] wanting to do something better something
[16:41] different to better themselves
[16:45] I also want to identify with my brothers
[16:50] I'm not sure when God will allow me to
[16:52] see them
[16:55] but it doesn't mean that when I can go
[16:59] I start practice
[17:25] if you can follow me to Philippians 1
[17:28] verse 6 yes
[17:31] [Music]
[17:38] allowing me and my brothers to preach
[18:09] [Music]
[18:14] being confident of this very thing that
[18:17] he which hath begun a good work in you
[18:19] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[18:21] Christ
[18:23] I'm not sure if this brings you Joy or
[18:25] gladness
[18:30] and where he begins he has to finish
[18:35] I will be making a prayer
[18:38] and his presence amen
[18:43] I give you thanks
[18:46] not deserving anything
[18:49] but you gave us the best gift
[18:53] your only begotten son Lord
[18:56] you love so much Lord is
[19:06] and why shouldn't we give the best of
[19:08] ourselves
[19:16] surrender them to you
[19:18] I ask you take control
[19:20] of your servant
[19:23] and my other brothers
[19:25] we surrender this service
[19:29] we ask all these things
[19:39] and the previous time I said
[19:52] are watching
[19:54] yes
[19:56] God put them in my memory and in my
[19:59] heart
[20:00] although they're not here physically
[20:03] I have them in my heart
[20:06] we miss you and we love you
[20:11] Josue so not our brother Felix and
[20:14] brother Josue
[20:16] together we got this title the
[20:19] resolution
[20:20] he is a resolution
[20:25] that he is a resolution yes
[20:29] we're closing the year now
[20:34] and I asked our pastor what do you like
[20:36] for us to preach
[20:38] we continue with the characters of The
[20:40] Bible
[20:43] and he please in having an end of year a
[20:47] subject
[20:52] and I said well if God allows I want to
[20:54] touch on every character we've spoken of
[20:56] yes
[20:58] and through the Holy Ghost God led me
[21:02] and I went to Google
[21:09] and I was looking for an article that
[21:11] would give me more
[21:13] resolutions why people fail in their uh
[21:16] New Year's dresses
[21:19] because if there's someone that fails in
[21:21] their resolutions
[21:28] because I believe there's a federal that
[21:32] failed
[21:35] so I found this article
[21:37] [Music]
[21:38] and he gave me 16 reasons
[21:42] why you fall short but
[21:46] of these 16 I want to share five years
[21:50] and the first one is
[21:55] you put the cart before the horse
[22:01] and the next one says you don't enjoy
[22:03] the process
[22:07] third is you don't track your Pros
[22:10] progress
[22:13] fourth you have no social support
[22:18] and the fifth one I love how it sounds
[22:21] in Spanish
[22:22] [Music]
[22:24] you know you're what but not your why
[22:26] okay rhyme
[22:34] [Music]
[23:28] no that's not the reason
[23:31] a
[24:00] I
[24:48] we're angry
[24:50] says well like Moses
[24:57] he allows us to make mistakes
[25:00] so that later
[25:03] God will show himself
[25:09] allows it for a reason it is
[25:16] the message remembering the Lord he says
[25:19] decision
[25:25] it's right there the first quote Oh if
[25:27] there's a decision to be made let
[25:30] esperemonos let's wait
[25:36] remember what kind of decision we think
[25:39] he would make
[25:41] [Music]
[25:44] then let that be our decision
[25:49] if we get history
[25:56] let's remember he was never in a hurry
[25:58] then
[26:04] says if we get over anxious
[26:12] remember he dwells in eternity
[26:18] time means nothing to him
[26:24] it's the motive and objective of our
[26:27] hearts
[26:29] more say no let's remember him
[26:35] give me if it's hard to understand me
[26:37] but um
[26:39] but what I understand
[26:42] and it's great what our brother Brandon
[26:44] says
[26:48] that time means nothing to him
[26:53] many times and and uh the end of the
[26:57] year comes
[26:58] and we feel now we can
[27:01] now is my time
[27:04] that's where we're failing
[27:09] because we're waiting for the situation
[27:15] and that's the only way God can work
[27:19] also works in disorders
[27:23] and God has shown it many times
[27:32] God
[27:35] allows them to for sure
[27:44] more than 40 years
[27:56] foreign
[28:46] of continuing to the second point
[28:50] you don't enjoy the process
[28:53] that's tremendous
[28:56] because many times
[28:59] there are two sides of the coin
[29:03] and especially youth we use this often
[29:07] I'm in the process
[29:10] as my mother says
[29:14] well you're not going to stay there
[29:17] out of that process
[29:21] she has a strong character is
[29:26] brought my process
[29:30] but when I think about this
[29:33] I say God
[29:36] how did Abraham do it
[29:39] 25 years
[29:42] enjoying the
[29:45] processando
[30:10] you need all the tools
[30:13] [Music]
[30:49] [Music]
[31:09] there's a difference
[31:22] also helps us through the process
[31:30] every day he Rejoice even if he didn't
[31:33] see results
[31:48] and if we're Abrahams for Father Abraham
[31:52] seeds
[31:56] then we take every promise God man amen
[31:58] amen no importance
[32:02] no matter how ridiculous it looks like
[32:07] how it could not happen but if God said
[32:09] so
[32:15] now Abraham
[32:19] when he was supposed to have this
[32:21] foreign
[32:29] foreign
[32:57] [Music]
[33:11] battle
[33:13] star Allegre but if you can be glad
[33:19] just that you're waking up or getting up
[33:22] yeah
[33:24] and doing more than what you used to
[33:28] Cristiano I believe a Christian
[33:32] if God allows him to stop speaking yes
[33:34] the small things
[33:57] small things God works in more
[34:10] it says you don't track your progress
[34:16] and I believe as youth that's something
[34:19] we should do
[34:20] yo Mexican
[34:23] more than anyone I identify with this is
[34:30] because we know we aren't what we should
[34:32] be
[34:34] but as our sister said
[34:38] we aren't what we used to be either
[34:41] foreign
[35:03] [Music]
[35:29] [Music]
[35:51] and he knows that you're giving your
[35:53] best effort he
[35:55] yeah and he knows that you will fail
[35:59] pero
[36:03] but he has given us his word
[36:08] so that we're in whenever we're in that
[36:11] dark moment
[36:14] yes sir with the right words
[36:18] maneuver us from that
[36:22] mentals
[36:24] I'm not sure if anyone has been in that
[36:27] dark moment
[36:29] where you feel the worst
[36:33] greatest hypocrite in church
[36:38] feeling that you don't do anything right
[36:42] feeling that you let the whole world
[36:45] down
[36:46] yeah
[36:48] and I'm opening my heart a little here
[36:53] feeling every time people see me
[36:57] they see a two-face
[37:03] but by God's grace
[37:07] Uno
[37:15] [Music]
[37:21] Psalms 1 1.
[37:24] but by God's grace he gave me this one
[37:28] Psalms 32. I don't have it there
[37:32] in English but I'm going to say it in
[37:34] English blessed is he whose
[37:37] transgression Is Forgiven
[37:39] whose sin is covered
[37:42] blessed is the man who the Lord does not
[37:45] impute iniquity and in whose Spirit
[37:47] there is no deceited
[38:02] you know what iniquity means
[38:06] knowing to do what's right
[38:09] yeah doing wrong or evil
[38:15] and I believe this verse the scripture
[38:18] is
[38:21] a great gift God has given me
[38:26] knowing I would be in a dark moment
[38:31] knowing that I would commit iniquity
[38:36] but he knew I needed to know something
[38:40] he gave me such a great gift
[38:44] his only begotten son is
[38:52] can be here sitting
[39:27] God bless you brother
[39:32] God bless you Brothers
[39:35] the title is
[39:37] the resolution is him
[39:40] if we could just give a clap offering to
[39:43] brother Gustavo Gustavo
[39:46] he did such an amazing job
[39:50] I I look up to him
[39:53] even though he's younger than me
[39:56] yeah I I look up to him your last middle
[39:59] the way he serves God
[40:01] he helps out in many different places
[40:04] and I believe that he is a blessed young
[40:06] man
[40:08] and something that he said in this verse
[40:14] on the good things
[40:17] God has given us
[40:20] it's not the exact the verse
[40:23] were you reading I'm just I'm just
[40:25] repeating what he said
[40:33] and and then I like the last part of the
[40:36] verse that he read amen
[40:39] well he begins
[40:42] he will finish
[40:43] that means he will not leave something
[40:46] halfway done
[40:49] where he starts okay
[40:51] well God starts
[40:54] he will finish
[40:57] and if you can open your scriptures
[41:00] to James chapter 1 Ayan Santiago UNO
[41:04] verse 17 verse I would like to thank God
[41:08] for this opportunity
[41:14] for putting this trust in Meza
[41:21] every gift and every perfect gift is
[41:24] from above and they cometh down from the
[41:27] fathers from the father of light and who
[41:31] it variableness neither a shadow of
[41:35] turning
[41:47] I wanna I I
[41:49] when when I found out I was going to
[41:52] preach the this week
[41:55] I I started talking to the brothers
[41:58] what were we going to talk about
[42:01] and I thought we were going to continue
[42:03] talking about the Bible characters
[42:10] that he already had talked to brother
[42:13] and he wanted us to talk about something
[42:16] about the end of the year
[42:19] and as I started to meditate
[42:22] you know I started to think about it
[42:26] you know
[42:28] um since it's the end of the year
[42:31] you know it's a time that people give a
[42:34] lot
[42:35] you know a lot of people give gifts
[42:38] you know we start checking our
[42:40] resolutions
[42:45] what we what we said we're gonna do at
[42:48] the beginning of the year
[42:52] we want to say we say oh that I that I
[42:55] accomplished the goals that I said I was
[42:57] going to accomplish and I said
[43:00] like some of us in the beginning of the
[43:03] year
[43:05] we say I'm gonna lose weight
[43:08] and we end up eating more yeah
[43:11] you know we end up gaining more weight
[43:14] so we must have peso you know some of us
[43:16] say I'm gonna save more money this year
[43:19] I'm going to try to get my credit score
[43:25] you know we or when Christmas comes
[43:28] around
[43:29] you know it's Christmas is this weekend
[43:33] we're always waiting to see what kind of
[43:35] gift we're going to receive
[43:39] you know we want we want to get get what
[43:42] we we want to receive what we're hoping
[43:44] we want to receive
[43:47] we so sometimes we're like oh I want
[43:50] this I want that all right
[43:54] and when we don't receive it
[43:57] sometimes sometimes we get mad
[44:00] I remember when I was a kid
[44:03] you know I I used to tell my parents I
[44:06] want this
[44:07] I want that I want the fastest remote
[44:11] control car in the whole neighborhood
[44:16] you know and they would just give me
[44:18] clothes
[44:21] so when I started working
[44:24] you know I started buying myself
[44:26] something nice every year for Christmas
[44:30] you know I would treat myself
[44:34] you know but I I believe as us
[44:37] Christians
[44:39] you know we received the best gifts
[44:44] more than 2 000 years ago I said and
[44:49] that was is Jesus Christ
[44:51] as we know he didn't come around this
[44:53] time
[44:55] you know we as we know he didn't come
[44:58] around this time
[44:59] as the world makes it seems
[45:03] you know but we re but but when he came
[45:07] he he gave us the best gift that anybody
[45:10] could ever receive
[45:13] it's better than any car as my whole
[45:15] cake it's any better than any piece of
[45:18] jewelry
[45:20] is better than any pair of shoes
[45:24] any purse any iPad anything
[45:28] he is the best thing that he could give
[45:31] us
[45:32] and I believe that is the best thing
[45:42] foreign
[45:50] and he he surrendered everything at
[45:54] Calvary
[45:55] he said it is finished
[45:58] he said it is done
[46:01] and he went down to the depths of house
[46:05] and he conquered every demons
[46:09] conquered every sickness
[46:12] and he came back up
[46:15] and he came back and he poured himself
[46:18] in his children
[46:20] he poured every single of himself and
[46:23] his children
[46:24] and that is the best thing that we could
[46:27] ever receive
[46:29] I I think that's to be the that we
[46:32] should all be grateful for them
[46:37] but I am happy that
[46:41] there is no sickness that can beat me
[46:46] that can beat me
[46:48] brothers and sisters
[46:51] there is no demon that can take you down
[46:58] and say God it is yours there is nothing
[47:01] that can take me down
[47:03] nothing that can stop me
[47:06] there is nothing that can beat me to the
[47:08] ground
[47:10] because you already took everything for
[47:12] me
[47:15] you know and sometimes like Christmas
[47:18] you know I'm saying this for myself
[47:22] you know God is just waiting for us
[47:26] he is waiting for us to receive him no
[47:29] sir
[48:28] all those good things that you have
[48:30] foreign
[49:36] I want to give myself God to you I want
[49:40] to give myself more to God
[49:43] you know I'm tired of failing
[49:46] I'm tired of stumbling
[49:49] I don't know who else is tired of that
[49:53] year after year
[49:55] we go through the same thing
[49:58] we say we're gonna do something
[50:01] and we don't do it
[50:03] we go again year after year
[50:06] and say God I'm gonna do this
[50:10] forget about those goals
[50:13] about putting up your credit score
[50:15] is
[50:18] saving up more money
[50:21] hey
[50:41] I don't know about you
[50:43] but I won 2023
[50:47] I want to surrender more to God

[51:53] [Music]

[52:05] the Holy Spirit

[52:13] speak this week

[52:38] children
[52:40] that's how I want to help I see let's
[52:43] get on you that that's how I want to
[52:45] surrender myself
