[32:05] preacher oh you you may be
[32:09] seated
[32:10] um I was never I never preached
[32:15] before I've shared
[32:18] testimony and I always felt like
[32:20] preaching was not my
[32:24] thing and before moving to Colorado
[32:28] and brother Tito told
[32:30] me he said get
[32:32] ready you're going to you're going to
[32:34] share one
[32:37] day and I I got scared from that
[32:40] point I was probably thinking about stay
[32:44] in
[32:48] California but I didn't want to be
[32:49] scared
[32:52] anymore amen amen I like the verse that
[32:56] we read right now
[32:59] talks about being in one
[33:03] Accord yeah I started um start studying
[33:07] the
[33:08] Bible and I started to ask myself what
[33:10] is to be in one
[33:15] Accord and um a lot of brothers were
[33:17] telling
[33:19] me it's to be
[33:22] together to be
[33:25] United to be United in harmony
[33:30] amen just like the scripture was talking
[33:32] about that they were all
[33:36] United they were in one Accord in one
[33:41] place amen amen that's how we should be
[33:43] in this
[33:45] evening we should be in one
[33:48] Accord amen I know it's not it's not
[33:52] easy it's
[33:55] tough Nobody's Perfect
[33:59] everybody has
[34:01] mistakes sometimes um these
[34:05] people they let they let these evil
[34:07] spirits come between
[34:11] them and what does that
[34:14] produce it doesn't it produces not to be
[34:16] in
[34:18] unity to not be in
[34:22] Fellowship amen amen we have to be in
[34:25] Fellowship
[34:28] we have to love one
[34:31] another I you might have some beef with
[34:37] someone you you may not like your
[34:40] sister you may not like your
[34:43] brother but you still got to love him
[34:46] amen you got to if you're in this
[34:49] place you got to love your brother and
[34:54] sister sometimes I fail in that
[34:59] but I want to be
[35:01] better I want to love you I want to love
[35:05] each and every one of you in
[35:07] this I don't like to have problems with
[35:11] anybody and it's
[35:14] hard but I love
[35:16] you because I want to be in
[35:20] unity in harmony I want to have that
[35:23] Fellowship
[35:27] talking to to
[35:30] heido he told me something very very
[35:35] important said we can't be in one
[35:40] Accord if two are not in
[35:45] Fellowship two are in
[35:49] disagreement we can't be in that
[35:53] Fellowship um I
[35:55] keep when when I first moved
[36:00] here they kept asking me the same
[36:05] question why did why did you move to
[36:07] Fort
[36:08] Collins fors why did you come over
[36:11] here and um I found my answer this
[36:15] week studying this of
[36:19] Fellowship I started to when I first
[36:21] began to come
[36:24] here I started to see that Fellowship in
[36:27] this
[36:29] church that beautiful unity and
[36:33] Harmony how United the brothers
[36:37] were how United the youth
[36:41] were and they were all United in
[36:45] Harmony and because of
[36:47] that during the
[36:50] services I was able to I experience God
[36:53] in this place
[36:57] love in this
[36:59] place that that's what we got to keep
[37:02] doing we all got to be in
[37:06] harmony to be able to feel God's
[37:10] presence to receive the
[37:13] ghost I didn't finish reading the
[37:18] scripture like we're in Acts 4 Acts 2
[37:21] verse
[37:26] four and they were all filled with the
[37:28] Holy
[37:31] Ghost and began to speak with other
[37:35] tongues as the spirit gave them
[37:41] utterance that's something isn't that
[37:43] something
[37:44] beautiful man it I just it's it's good
[37:49] to be part of of of the love of
[37:53] Christ I like when when they were
[37:55] preaching last Sunday
[37:59] brotherto and
[38:02] brother they said I don't want to belong
[38:06] to a church I don't want to belong to
[38:08] Voice of
[38:12] Truth I want to belong to Jesus
[38:16] Christ I want to belong belong to the
[38:18] love of
[38:20] Jesus I want to be able to project that
[38:25] love it it it's it's hard
[38:29] where where I come
[38:31] from it was very hard for me to feel
[38:33] that
[38:36] way to feel that
[38:39] love um sometimes I didn't even go to
[38:43] church and um I didn't feel part of a of
[38:46] a
[38:49] community didn't feel part of a of a
[38:51] United
[38:54] family and I didn't I didn't feel God's
[38:57] love love in that
[39:00] moment and I told my
[39:04] parents I said I think I'm gonna
[39:10] move because if I continue this
[39:14] way I'll probably get
[39:17] lost I'll probably go a different
[39:20] route I'll probably end up in the
[39:24] streets I don't want to end up like that
[39:28] I want to end up in in the love of Jesus
[39:31] Christ that's where I want to be part
[39:35] of and it's that's that's the beauty
[39:38] about having that fellowship with one
[39:41] another become part of
[39:44] something you're part of a
[39:47] family you should be happy that you're
[39:51] family you should be happy that you're
[39:53] part of the love of Jesus Christ
[39:57] we can live a life when Jesus Christ is
[40:00] in our
[40:02] hearts if you allow Jesus to be in your
[40:07] heart you can become of that family that
[40:14] Fellowship in one
[40:18] Accord it's um it's what I was studying
[40:22] this
[40:23] week and um one day that I got a day off
[40:30] I went up to I went up I went hiking to
[40:31] the
[40:34] mountains and I I I
[40:36] prayed I said Lord what's your purpose
[40:39] with
[40:41] me what am I doing
[40:45] here what what do you want me to be what
[40:48] do you want me to
[40:50] become I want you to guide me
[40:53] Lord in that moment I broke down
[40:58] I said Lord I just want to give my life
[41:01] to
[41:02] you I want you to guide
[41:06] me I want you to use
[41:09] me just Touch My Heart
[41:13] Lord and reading this
[41:18] theme I was able to understand that
[41:20] that's the
[41:23] beauty this place being in this family
[41:28] I don't practice it that
[41:30] much but I don't say I love you to my
[41:37] parents but I want to change
[41:39] that I want to say I love you
[41:43] dad I love you Mom I love you

[41:52] us brother in
[41:55] Christ we should say I love you
[41:58] brother I love you sister you should not
[42:02] hate your
[42:04] brother you're because you don't know
[42:06] what could happen the next
[42:09] day you might lose that
[42:12] person you won't be able to say I'm

[42:41] love and
[42:44] harmony to be in one

[43:07] here that I I I just want to change my

[44:39] prepared to receive
[44:41] something to open your
[44:44] hearts and to really just trust in the
[44:46] Lord
[44:48] tonight you see our title for
[44:53] tonight is under the
[44:56] influence Inu and as a subtitle I
[45:00] put a steady hand for a sudden
[45:10] blessing
[45:12] amen uh sorry now you're okay um if we
[45:16] could go to
[45:20] acts uh verse
[45:24] one un
[45:31] sorry Acts chapter
[45:36] one uh verse
[45:40] S it says like this and he said unto
[45:42] them it is not for you to know the times
[45:45] or the season which the father has put
[45:47] in his own
[45:55] power you see what I want to talk about
[45:59] tonight is about
[46:03] waiting you see we see the disciples and
[46:06] the one the 120 that were in the upper
[46:11] room brother brandom says they were up
[46:13] there for 10
[46:16] days before the Holy Ghost came
[46:21] down you see a lot of the
[46:24] times we're too focused
[46:27] on
[46:29] ourselves you see I was asking around
[46:31] why is it a lot of the
[46:35] [Music]
[46:37] times I asked around to other
[46:40] people why is it a lot of times we can't
[46:44] wait uh some people told me we don't
[46:46] have
[46:50] patience some told me they we don't have
[46:54] love others told me we're selfish
[46:59] other others told
[47:01] me that we just want everything in our
[47:03] own
[47:04] [Music]
[47:06] time you see a lot of the
[47:09] times we wait for many things in this
[47:13] world you see we wait in
[47:16] lines uh to get our
[47:19] food uh we wait at grocery
[47:23] stores those are little things that we
[47:25] wait for
[47:28] then there's bigger things when we're
[47:29] waiting for a doctor to tell us our
[47:36] results you see a lot of people can't
[47:38] wait a lot of the
[47:40] times it's because we're too aware of
[47:45] time you see
[47:47] myself I can't wait a lot of the
[47:51] times because I'm too aware of what's
[47:53] going on around me
[47:57] I'm too aware that I want everything
[48:00] now you see but we see the disciples
[48:04] here in
[48:06] verse in verse
[48:09] 14 of Acts
[48:13] one it
[48:16] says they all these all continue with
[48:18] one Accord in prayer and supplication
[48:27] and supplication means the action of
[48:29] asking or begging for something
[48:31] earnestly or
[48:36] humbly with the woman and Mary the
[48:39] mother of Jesus and with his
[48:42] Brethren and then in the next verse it
[48:44] says and then the and those days Peter
[48:46] stood up in the midst of the disciples
[48:48] the number of names altogether were
[48:50] about 120
[49:00] you see we see
[49:03] them in other words they were crying
[49:07] out they weren't just there oh Lord I
[49:10] want the Holy
[49:14] Ghost oh Lord whenever you give it to
[49:17] me see a lot of the
[49:20] times you know we go out into the
[49:22] world you know
[49:25] myself I might be at
[49:28] work talking about certain things around
[49:30] my co-workers that might not be
[49:34] right you know you might be doing things
[49:37] with your
[49:39] friends that aren't
[49:41] right listening to worldly
[49:45] music let's get personal
[49:49] tonight I struggle with worldly music a
[49:51] lot of the
[49:53] times it's hard you know you you can't
[49:56] let it
[49:58] go you like the
[50:00] beat but a lot of the
[50:03] times you know like these disciples here
[50:06] we see that they were waiting
[50:09] earnestly they were pleading out they
[50:12] were crying out to
[50:13] him saying Lord come to
[50:17] us Lord we want your Holy
[50:21] Ghost we need it
[50:23] now no it doesn't say exactly those
[50:25] words but that's what what I believe
[50:27] they were
[50:29] saying you say they were crying out for
[50:33] it what are you crying out for
[50:36] tonight what are you waiting for what is
[50:40] your goal is your goal just to be here
[50:43] at church and sit on the
[50:46] Pew just to come to the Altar and cry
[50:49] here and
[50:50] there just to say I'm a
[50:54] Christian you see a lot of the times
[50:56] even you know when you're out there in
[50:57] the
[50:59] world just to tell let people tell you
[51:02] oh you're
[51:06] different that's nothing anymore
[51:09] brother there's a lot of people that are
[51:11] different out
[51:12] there there's a lot of people that you
[51:15] could say they're
[51:17] different living better than
[51:21] me doing better things than me
[51:27] so what does that have to do with people
[51:29] telling you
[51:34] that is that all we
[51:39] want you see I was
[51:42] reading and I read something and I
[51:44] really liked
[51:46] it now I'm smiling a lot because I'm I'm
[51:52] excited I don't know if you guys are but
[51:54] I'm excited
[51:57] you know recently I've been getting into
[51:58] the word
[52:00] more listening to a message during my
[52:03] lunchtime at
[52:06] work and it's been helping me a
[52:09] lot but anyways it says what we
[52:12] experienced suddenly was usually
[52:15] engineered steadily
[52:30] so what I mean by
[52:31] this is behinds most things that happen
[52:34] quickly before our
[52:37] eyes it was consistency that enabled
[52:42] us or that enabled it to happen that we
[52:45] didn't
[52:48] see you see a lot of the
[52:51] times God is working behind the
[52:54] scenes see a lot of
[52:57] times when we're
[52:59] struggling when we can't get out of our
[53:03] Temptations when I can't stop listening
[53:05] to
[53:07] music when I can't stop drinking or
[53:09] doing
[53:12] drugs or watching
[53:15] pornography or being
[53:18] alone or always saying that I'm
[53:21] failing because a lot of times we put
[53:23] ourselves down as well
[53:29] and that's not of
[53:31] God or a lot of times we struggling with
[53:34] our
[53:37] sickness when we don't see God
[53:39] moving and we just want to give
[53:42] up God is working behind the
[53:46] scenes you see these disciples were
[53:49] praying you see I bet they were
[53:51] struggling as
[53:52] well I bet the devil was attacking them
[53:55] in their mind
[53:57] saying just get up and
[53:59] leave why are you still here why are you
[54:03] still coming to
[54:04] church why do you still come to Friday
[54:07] services you're still the
[54:10] same you got baptized and you still
[54:14] struggle you talk about the
[54:16] word You Preach you play
[54:20] music you try to help
[54:23] others but when you're alone in your own
[54:25] room
[54:28] you're still
[54:30] struggling why don't you just give
[54:33] up why don't you just stop all this
[54:35] Jesus
[54:38] stuff and finish
[54:41] it and just go out into the
[54:46] world you
[54:50] see a lot of the
[54:52] times God wants
[54:54] us to have steady
[55:00] hands to have a steady
[55:03] heart to have a steady
[55:05] mind to have steady
[55:08] feet because let me tell you these
[55:13] 120 they had to be
[55:16] steady they couldn't receive something
[55:18] so
[55:20] strong because it was going to blow them
[55:23] away they weren't going to know what to
[55:25] do with it
[55:27] you see a lot of times God tells
[55:29] us son let's walk
[55:32] slowly son let me show you just
[55:36] wait showing us Little Things by
[55:40] little you
[55:43] see you know a lot of the
[55:45] times you think God's not
[55:50] watching you see a lot of
[55:54] times you know there's a couple
[55:57] people here with
[56:00] businesses a lot of the
[56:03] times you think oh I'm GNA get there one
[56:07] day they think it's just gonna happen
[56:09] like that
[56:11] suddenly but if you ask
[56:14] them what did it take to get from where
[56:17] you're at right
[56:20] now what battles did you have to go
[56:23] through what struggles did you have to
[56:25] go through
[56:27] to build such a good
[56:30] business I bet you a lot of them won't
[56:32] tell
[56:35] you that it just happened out of
[56:38] nowhere you see a lot of them are going
[56:41] to tell you they went through
[56:43] stuff they maybe didn't have money at
[56:46] times to Fe their own
[56:49] families they maybe
[56:51] struggled waned to give
[56:54] up that's how we are a lot of times
[56:56] that's how I
[56:57] am I want to give up I want to say Lord
[57:01] I can't no
[57:02] more it's been too
[57:04] long I can't wait for your Holy Spirit
[57:07] no
[57:08] more but you
[57:11] see a lot of people once you
[57:15] receive what you
[57:17] have a lot of people come to
[57:21] you and they tell
[57:23] you oh that happen so quick
[57:28] you got rid of your your sickness so
[57:31] quick you're healed now oh you got rid
[57:34] of that Temptation so
[57:37] quick you got rid of this and
[57:40] that how do you love your brother in so
[57:43] much how are you so United
[57:46] now you see Peter 50 days before this
[57:52] Pentecost he was denying Jesus
[57:56] then 50 days
[57:57] later he was preaching about
[58:01] Pentecost and he seen 3,000
[58:06] converted you
[58:08] see a lot of people will tell you
[58:11] that but they don't know what you went
[58:13] through behind the
[58:15] scenes they don't see how you
[58:19] cried they don't see what it cost you
[58:21] really what it cost
[58:23] you they don't see what you went through
[58:27] they don't see how you just wanted to
[58:29] fail you just wanted to give
[58:32] up how you wanted to just fail
[58:37] God how it was so
[58:40] painful to dig up those
[58:43] roots that you had to dig
[58:46] up to let
[58:49] go you see because it's
[58:51] hard it's hard to wait
[58:56] it's not
[58:58] easy but what happens when you
[59:02] wait people are going to think you're
[59:05] crazy you see I'm not going to read the
[59:07] verse because I'm running out of time
[59:10] but it says later on in this
[59:13] chapter that they thought they were
[59:16] drunk on new wine
[59:19] and oh but when you receive the Holy
[59:23] Ghost when you receive something it's
[59:25] going to stir up inside of
[59:28] you you're going to look drunk to
[59:31] everyone you're going to look
[59:33] crazy you're going to look like you're
[59:35] out of
[59:37] control no one's going to be able to
[59:39] control you
[59:43] anymore if we could go to
[59:47] proverbs
[59:49] 31 chapter
[59:51] 13 you see our our pastor was preaching
[59:54] about this Sunday he shared this with me
[59:56] in the back and I really liked
[59:59] it and it says like this she seeketh
[1:00:02] wool and flax and worketh willingly with
[1:00:05] their
[1:00:08] hands she is like the mer Merchant chips
[1:00:12] she bringeth her food from
[1:00:17] afar now the pastor really opened up my
[1:00:19] mind
[1:00:21] here so she brings her food from afar
[1:00:26] so we see
[1:00:27] here that she's working all time
[1:00:33] before so she doesn't just work on
[1:00:35] Friday when we come to
[1:00:38] service she doesn't just work on
[1:00:41] Sunday or Wednesday No but she's working
[1:00:45] Monday she working Tuesday she's working
[1:00:48] Thursday she's working Saturday she's
[1:00:52] working every
[1:00:53] day asking God renew me Lord I can't do
[1:00:58] this on my own anymore I need you I've
[1:01:02] been waiting so
[1:01:04] long but I watch your spirit and no
[1:01:07] matter how
[1:01:09] long no matter how long it
[1:01:12] takes I'm going to
[1:01:14] wait for your Holy Ghost to come
[1:01:19] down and fill
[1:01:21] me amen amen I want to read a quote
[1:01:25] before I finish
[1:01:28] and it's in the message God keeps his
[1:01:31] word and it says like this
[1:01:42] see they went up there how long to wait
[1:01:45] how long two days five
[1:01:51] days asking
[1:01:54] asking until what happen
[1:01:57] happened they was all in one place one
[1:02:01] Accord he says it again one
[1:02:05] Accord they wasn't
[1:02:07] arguing I'm a
[1:02:12] Pharisee no it'll never come on a group
[1:02:15] like that not a bit never

[1:02:59] God has been
[1:03:03] promised oh don't you love God's God's
[1:03:05] word has already been promised

[1:03:11] Holy
[1:03:13] Ghost Joel said he would do
[1:03:17] it and we're waiting for the word to be
[1:03:21] fulfilled and then he asked and then he

[1:04:02] wait now the word said
[1:04:05] so and every spot of
[1:04:09] Jesus Jesus's life was was a fulfilling
[1:04:12] of the that
[1:04:14] word he told us to wait here before we
[1:04:17] went to preach the
[1:04:20] gospel all the way around the
[1:04:23] world and that every creature on the
[1:04:25] Earth Earth hear the

[1:04:49] tonight are you going to wait for your

[1:05:14] close give me your all I know it's hard
[1:05:18] I struggle I'm part of you
[1:05:21] guys I know what it is to
[1:05:24] struggle I know how it is out
[1:05:27] there sometimes you want to
[1:05:30] drink you want to go with your friends
[1:05:32] out
[1:05:34] there and go
[1:05:38] party there's a lot of things that you
[1:05:40] want to
[1:05:41] do but if you
[1:05:43] wait there's a better reward at the
[1:05:47] end you just
[1:05:49] wait God bless you
[1:05:53] [Applause]
[1:05:58] God bless
[1:06:00] everyone it's good to be in the house of
[1:06:02] the
[1:06:03] Lord uh I'm just going to read acts two
[1:06:06] verse
[1:06:09] one
[1:06:11] quickly it reads like
[1:06:13] this and when the day of Pentecost was
[1:06:16] fully come they were all with one Accord
[1:06:19] in one place
[1:06:26] uh you know uh when uh when I was uh
[1:06:31] when I was
[1:06:32] younger uh I uh I had I had the the I
[1:06:37] think it's a it was a
[1:06:39] privilege maybe some of you
[1:06:42] won't but uh I was like uh I was like 19
[1:06:44] years old
[1:06:47] 18 uh I uh I got to work in the
[1:06:50] mountains quite a
[1:06:53] bit and uh what one of the one of the
[1:06:56] things that I I I thought I was I
[1:06:58] thought I was the coolest the coolest
[1:06:59] young person in the
[1:07:04] world uh that I would I would uh I would
[1:07:08] they they would allow us to go into the
[1:07:17] helicopters we would uh we we'd get in
[1:07:21] helicopters and uh and
[1:07:26] we the reason we'd get in there was
[1:07:27] because we'd have to go to remote
[1:07:33] areas and uh but for the helicopter to
[1:07:36] uh to
[1:07:42] land um then uh there had to be a there
[1:07:46] had to be a landing
[1:07:50] strip uh so so all the obstructions
[1:07:56] uh they had to be had to be
[1:07:59] removed uh so the helicopter could
[1:08:03] land uh and uh you know uh when we uh
[1:08:07] when we see where um where these uh the
[1:08:10] 120 were
[1:08:14] gathered uh they were gathered in the
[1:08:16] upper
[1:08:19] room uh you know and uh so what I'm
[1:08:23] getting at is this
[1:08:25] uh that there had to be a
[1:08:28] preparation you know in order for
[1:08:31] Pentecost to fully
[1:08:34] come and uh you know when we uh look at
[1:08:37] the
[1:08:39] apostles and uh in John chapter
[1:08:43] 20 of verse
[1:08:46] 19 uh it reads like
[1:08:49] this it says then the same day at
[1:08:54] evening uh being the first day of the
[1:08:57] week it says when the doors were shut
[1:09:00] where the disciples were assembled for
[1:09:01] fear for fear of the
[1:09:09] Jews came Jesus and stood in their midst
[1:09:12] and said unto them peace be unto
[1:09:18] you so these same uh these same the same
[1:09:22] Peter that was in the upper room
[1:09:27] and the rest of the
[1:09:29] Apostles there was at one time when they
[1:09:32] were
[1:09:37] scared at one point they were
[1:09:41] scared uh the the what I'm getting at is
[1:09:44] is is
[1:09:46] this is that these these
[1:09:50] Apostles uh they weren't
[1:09:52] always they weren't always uh they
[1:09:54] weren't always you know um um
[1:10:00] courageous but but you know what what
[1:10:02] what what it was was
[1:10:04] this is that God had to show
[1:10:08] them that how weak they
[1:10:12] were oh without
[1:10:16] him because as soon as Jesus comes off
[1:10:18] the
[1:10:21] sea they realized how how little they
[1:10:25] can
[1:10:27] do and how small we
[1:10:30] are you see it was it was it was an
[1:10:34] influence of
[1:10:36] fear uh that took them to have the
[1:10:41] fear and go hide and lock the
[1:10:46] door and and and and and run from these
[1:10:51] Jews you see but but but God is not a
[1:10:54] god of fear
[1:10:58] I have a God that's not scared of
[1:11:01] anybody he's not scared of
[1:11:05] anything but what Peter had to
[1:11:08] do and not only
[1:11:11] Peter but anybody else that wanted the
[1:11:16] promise what they had to
[1:11:18] do was to begin to remove every obstacle
[1:11:23] [Applause]
[1:11:27] obstruction anything that in their lives
[1:11:30] that was
[1:11:33] hindering for the Holy Ghost to come
[1:11:37] down because I most certainly
[1:11:41] believe that the Holy
[1:11:43] Ghost he wants to
[1:11:46] land he wants to land
[1:11:50] somewhere he wants to land in the hearts
[1:11:52] of his people
[1:11:56] he cannot
[1:11:58] land or where there is
[1:12:02] filth where there is
[1:12:04] sin where there where there are these
[1:12:07] the the evil
[1:12:09] things where he cannot
[1:12:13] land so so
[1:12:15] Peter and the
[1:12:18] Apostles of what they
[1:12:20] did was they began to prepare
[1:12:25] amen amen I I I want to read John 20
[1:12:28] verse 21 and
[1:12:32] 22 it says then Jesus said to them
[1:12:37] again peace be unto
[1:12:39] you it says as my father had sent
[1:12:42] me even so I send
[1:12:46] you and when he had said
[1:12:49] this it says he breathed on
[1:12:53] them and said unto
[1:12:55] them receive ye the holy
[1:12:59] ghost that that's what he told
[1:13:02] them uh but as Isaac was
[1:13:06] saying he sends them to
[1:13:10] Jerusalem and he tells them to wait
[1:13:12] there for until they were filled from
[1:13:15] from the power from on
[1:13:19] high and and the reason it was 10
[1:13:22] days because Jesus had spent 40 days
[1:13:26] with the
[1:13:30] apostles so in order for there to be a
[1:13:35] Pentecost there had to be 10 more
[1:13:40] days for there to be
[1:13:44] Pentecost because we know that
[1:13:45] throughout the
[1:13:47] Bible that that 50 means
[1:13:52] Pentecost it was it was the it was the
[1:13:54] feast of the first
[1:13:57] fruits amen amen and that's what they
[1:14:00] were preparing
[1:14:03] for but you know the thing of it
[1:14:06] is it's not as easy as you
[1:14:11] think because a
[1:14:15] birth is
[1:14:17] painful you see and so this this first
[1:14:21] church was about to be born
[1:14:27] that they were about to be
[1:14:29] born so when something is
[1:14:34] born you know there's growing
[1:14:37] pain you see and that's that's what the
[1:14:40] church is going
[1:14:42] through you see because I believe I
[1:14:44] serve a
[1:14:46] God that does not
[1:14:48] change you see and if they had to go
[1:14:50] through Growing Pains back there
[1:14:55] back
[1:14:56] then then we have to go through them
[1:15:03] now brother Bram says this he says oh
[1:15:07] God wants to restore the faith that was
[1:15:09] once delivered to the
[1:15:13] Saints you say brother brandham is that
[1:15:15] the
[1:15:16] faith he says don't take the Methodist
[1:15:22] ritual the Baptist ritual
[1:15:25] or Pentecost
[1:15:26] ritual it says take the
[1:15:29] Bible he says let's see what they
[1:15:33] did he say they were all in the upper
[1:15:35] room with one
[1:15:38] Accord and suddenly the same rushing
[1:15:40] wind came from
[1:15:42] [Applause]
[1:15:44] heaven filled all the house where they
[1:15:46] were
[1:15:49] sitting he says well you
[1:15:51] say I don't know whether to do this or
[1:15:54] not
[1:15:57] if I go outside they'll make fun of
[1:15:59] me if I say anything well they couldn't
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:05] have he says no
[1:16:08] sir he says the Holy Ghost met
[1:16:12] them he says that bunch of little
[1:16:16] [Applause]
[1:16:17] cowards I said that's what brother Bram
[1:16:20] said before they got the Holy Ghost
[1:16:25] he says that these apostles were
[1:16:29] cowards I
[1:16:31] wonder you know if if if uh we haven't
[1:16:34] if we can't see ourselves
[1:16:38] there because before you get the Holy
[1:16:42] Ghost you know sometimes we think we're
[1:16:46] ready sometimes we think we're ready for
[1:16:49] the Holy
[1:16:50] Ghost oh but we don't know what comes
[1:16:52] with this
[1:16:55] we don't know what what we don't know
[1:16:56] the
[1:16:59] responsibility we don't we don't we we
[1:17:01] want the Holy
[1:17:03] Ghost but we don't want to go through
[1:17:06] the
[1:17:08] process you see because things look
[1:17:12] easy when when when you're watching
[1:17:14] somebody
[1:17:16] Prosper but if you could only see what
[1:17:19] they go
[1:17:22] through but before they get there
[1:17:26] or you might think
[1:17:28] twice you see and people sometimes
[1:17:30] they're just like give it to
[1:17:33] me you see but God doesn't want you to
[1:17:36] fail you see God could have gave the the
[1:17:39] the apostles the Holy Ghost right there
[1:17:41] and
[1:17:44] there but he told them he said
[1:17:48] wait you see
[1:17:51] waiting and
[1:17:53] nowadays it's not
[1:17:55] easy especially in the time we're
[1:17:59] living we want things right
[1:18:03] now instant
[1:18:07] gratification that's what we
[1:18:10] want you see but God doesn't change you
[1:18:13] see he doesn't
[1:18:15] change uh you know to to to conform to
[1:18:21] you that's not the way God works I have
[1:18:25] a God that does not
[1:18:27] change he'll never change his
[1:18:31] program his program is his
[1:18:34] word amen amen the thing of it is is
[1:18:38] this is that you have to
[1:18:42] adapt to this
[1:18:45] word we have to go
[1:18:47] back brother brandham says this he says
[1:18:51] we have to go back to the Bible
[1:18:53] [Applause]
[1:18:55] we have to go back to the
[1:18:58] foundation you know when Peter had
[1:19:01] fear that's because he did not have
[1:19:05] love because if he had
[1:19:08] love the Bible says that that love that
[1:19:13] cast out all
[1:19:15] fear you see so when we believe
[1:19:18] God when we love
[1:19:21] God in perfect love
[1:19:25] but then all fear is
[1:19:28] gone you see the influence
[1:19:31] changes I read something here a while
[1:19:34] back the fruits of the
[1:19:37] spirit Galatians
[1:19:41] 5:23 it says
[1:19:44] this the first fruit of the
[1:19:48] spirit is
[1:19:50] love you see if you don't have
[1:19:53] love you can't have any of the
[1:19:57] rest you cannot have
[1:19:59] joy you cannot have
[1:20:02] peace you cannot have Longs
[1:20:05] suffering you cannot have Temperance
[1:20:09] patience
[1:20:10] kindness you can't have none of it if
[1:20:14] you don't have
[1:20:15] love so before the before you can get
[1:20:19] the Holy
[1:20:20] Ghost you got to love you have to love
[1:20:24] what
[1:20:25] do you have to if God tells you to
[1:20:29] wait you have to love to
[1:20:32] wait I don't hear a lot of
[1:20:35] amens well you know that's what he tells
[1:20:38] you to
[1:20:39] do his program is not going to change
[1:20:42] because just you didn't say
[1:20:45] Amen whether you agree or not that's the
[1:20:49] Bible you see he has them
[1:20:52] waiting but not only does he have them
[1:20:54] waiting
[1:20:56] uh but he has them to go to
[1:21:00] Jerusalem you see he didn't just say go
[1:21:03] to
[1:21:05] church but because the Bible
[1:21:07] says they were in one
[1:21:12] Accord they were they were in one
[1:21:16] mind one heart I believe it was one
[1:21:21] spirit amen amen and when he and when we
[1:21:25] when we look at those
[1:21:27] things you see I believe he was talking
[1:21:30] about a
[1:21:32] Unity uh because when when we when we
[1:21:35] are
[1:21:36] united you see we are we are in one
[1:21:40] Accord we are in one
[1:21:43] Spirit we are glorifying one
[1:21:47] God all of our
[1:21:49] glory is for God amen amen it was just
[1:21:57] one but when you are
[1:22:00] obedient because he tells he tells him
[1:22:03] to go
[1:22:07] somewhere brother Bram says this it says
[1:22:12] the perfect
[1:22:16] obedience it says it gives you the right
[1:22:18] to the
[1:22:21] Token amen that that's what brother bam
[1:22:24] said
[1:22:26] so they were
[1:22:27] there I believe they were
[1:22:30] waiting but I I don't believe that they
[1:22:32] weren't doing
[1:22:35] anything the Bible says they were in the
[1:22:38] upper
[1:22:39] room they were in
[1:22:42] prayer and in
[1:22:47] supplication that's what they were
[1:22:49] doing but they were doing
[1:22:52] something see they were waiting
[1:22:55] and they were
[1:22:56] working you see because when you
[1:22:59] wait you still got to
[1:23:02] work you see we're going towards
[1:23:06] something many people they think that
[1:23:09] they don't have to do
[1:23:11] anything and and that it's just GNA it's
[1:23:14] just going to
[1:23:15] happen that it's just going to come
[1:23:18] down you see God don't work like
[1:23:21] that you do everything that you can do
[1:23:26] you do everything God tells you to
[1:23:29] do and when you cannot do anything
[1:23:33] else I believe that God will
[1:23:37] do what you cannot
[1:23:41] do God will fill
[1:23:44] you with his
[1:23:46] Spirit he will come down and it will not
[1:23:50] be confined to a church building
[1:23:56] it will not be confined to this
[1:24:00] wall but I believe I have a
[1:24:03] God that when he comes down it will be
[1:24:07] an
[1:24:09] outpouring because when they got
[1:24:12] filled everybody knew about it everybody
[1:24:16] heard about it they weren't cowards
[1:24:20] anymore they were
[1:24:23] testifying they became true
[1:24:27] witnesses to the
[1:24:29] point that the people thought that they
[1:24:32] were
[1:24:34] drunk they weren't ashamed
[1:24:36] anymore they weren't running from
[1:24:40] anybody but I believe that God was so
[1:24:45] happy because this was the
[1:24:48] moment this was the
[1:24:51] time when the First Church of God
[1:24:56] had
[1:24:58] life that this is when it was
[1:25:02] born Jesus breathed the breath of
[1:25:07] life not just on the
[1:25:10] apostles but on everybody that was in
[1:25:13] that
[1:25:15] room you see it wasn't just not going to
[1:25:18] be just for brother
[1:25:20] Tito or the people that
[1:25:22] preach but if you want
[1:25:25] it or you can have it it can be for
[1:25:31] you it could be for
[1:25:34] anybody that wants
[1:25:38] it amen and I
[1:25:40] believe that the same God that came
[1:25:46] down with the same
[1:25:48] power with the same Russian Mighty
[1:25:52] Wind will come
[1:25:56] the same way it'll be the same
[1:25:59] power it won't be any
[1:26:02] different God does not give you
[1:26:04] something
[1:26:08] diluted he will not he will not delude
[1:26:11] something and then give it to his
[1:26:14] church it'll be the same
[1:26:17] power it will be the same
[1:26:21] God that will fill you
[1:26:24] the same one that filled
[1:26:26] Peter I will fill
[1:26:29] you it may be just a
[1:26:32] drop but I believe that that little
[1:26:37] drop is all
[1:26:40] power it's all
[1:26:43] power in
[1:26:47] closing when
[1:26:50] God when God
[1:26:56] fills this
[1:26:59] room you see because before
[1:27:03] this before the filling of the Holy
[1:27:07] Ghost in the Old
[1:27:10] Testament you see God would come
[1:27:13] down but then he would leave
[1:27:17] again he would come down on a
[1:27:19] prophet he would come down on the
[1:27:22] judges but then he would leave
[1:27:27] again because there was no dwelling
[1:27:29] place for
[1:27:32] him there was no dwelling place for him
[1:27:34] at the
[1:27:36] time oh because the Lamb of
[1:27:40] God which was Jesus
[1:27:42] Christ he had to
[1:27:45] come in order for that to take
[1:27:49] place that's what I
[1:27:51] believe and so when and when Jesus
[1:27:55] dies and our sins are
[1:27:59] forgiven and he he does away with all
[1:28:02] sin he does away with it
[1:28:06] all amen because I believe that's what
[1:28:08] Jesus
[1:28:10] di you see he finished off
[1:28:13] sin but the thing of it
[1:28:16] is the greatest
[1:28:18] thing after the death of
[1:28:21] Jesus was the birth of the church
[1:28:25] because that is when
[1:28:27] Jesus was able to
[1:28:31] reunite out with his children
[1:28:34] again but they didn't have to be scared
[1:28:38] anymore they didn't have to run
[1:28:41] anymore but because now God was going to
[1:28:45] be in
[1:28:46] them he was going to be in his
[1:28:49] church he was going to be in his
[1:28:52] children
[1:28:55] that's what it
[1:28:56] was it was the perfect
[1:29:00] Unity between God and
[1:29:02] man once
[1:29:04] again god with
[1:29:07] man I believe that do you believe that
[1:29:12] you can have
[1:29:14] it all you have to
[1:29:16] do is open your
[1:29:18] heart he wants to dwell in
[1:29:22] you that that's where his dwelling place
[1:29:26] is that is where his throne is it's in
[1:29:30] the heart of
[1:29:34] man that's all I have brothers God bless
