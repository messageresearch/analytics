in the temple of God and truly it's something that we we don't have words to express the love that God has towards us today we'll start speaking of the character Jonah one of the things I like about Jonah is in the first chapter Jonah can recognize that he's the problem and that's what we need is to recognize that many times we are the problem it's not God it's not our situation it's not our brother our sister we are the problem you can open your scripture to Jonah chapter 1 I'll be talking in English if when you have it if you can please say amen and it says like this the word of the Lord came to Jonah son of amiti go to the great city of Nineveh and preach against it because its wickedness has come come up before me but Jonah ran away from the Lord and headed for tares he went down to Joba where he found a ship Bound for that Port after paying the fair he went aboard and sell for tares to flee the Lord we can please by our heads dear heavenly father Lord Lord we thank you once again Lord for giving us your grace and your mercy Lord for giving us one more opportunity Lord to straighten Our Lives in the straight path to put our lives in the path that you have provided father without you we are nothing we worthless father but you you have made us wor father may we also recognize Lord Lord that there's not much time left we are at the end Lord Lord and and if if it's just one Soul father Lord may be me Lord Lord may be my may be my brothers Lord Lord but I ask that you may move tonight put this service in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated brothers and sisters now I don't know if you know the book of Jonah or the character of Jonah you know many many people know the Book of Jonah by him being eaten by whale you know but there's more to Jonah than just that you know in the first chapter of Jonah God is God gave Jonah a commission he said go and preach to Nineveh because his wickedness has come up before me now how many here when God tells you something or you know what to do you know but sometimes we try to tend to go a different routes you know and that's what happened to Jonah you know Jonah he brother Brown says that Jonah was a a good person know he was a true man of God you know but he's just his human as you and I are you know and sometimes you know the Bible says that that Jonah tried to flee from the Lord but let me tell you something all things work for good for those who believe in God you know and as we read the Book of Jonah you know Jonah got aboard this ship that was heading for tares you know and and there was Sailors on top of [Music] it and Jonah was found asleep in the midst of a storm after going a different path he was asleep and that happens to that that does happen to us many times when we try to flee from what God tells us to do or what we're supposed to do and then we get into our little comfort zone just like Jonah did you know the Bible says that there was this big storm raging you know but here was Jonah asleep and we can put it this way in his comfort zone how many of us sometimes get in our little Comfort zones I think I think we I think every day we we go into our little comfort zone amen but this but this sailor told Jonah he told Jonah he said how can you sleep he said get up and call your God maybe he will take notice of us that we will not perish you know and this is the part where Jonah recognizes he recognizes that he was the problem wasn't God it wasn't the situation that he was in it was himself in verse 12 he says after they threw the Bible says that they they pretty much took their chances on who was to blame for this you know and and it fell on Jonah you know and then he says this says pick me up and throw me into the sea verse and it will become calm I know that this is my fault and this great storm has come upon you now in the message the Queen of Sheba it says like this and when when God gave Jonah the commission and he went down to Nineveh he found a ship at leisure so he couldn't get his take and his fair maybe down to end of a so he just went to tares and they found out that he got in trouble I think that's what's the matter with the Christian church tonight we're in trouble we've took the wrong road and this is exactly what happened to Jonah he decided to do things his own way he tried to do of will of God you know but that wasn't the perfect will of God and continue saying and God's not in trouble it's the church that's in trouble it's me that's in trouble God wants us to be all one wants us to have Fellowship one with another you know and I think think that God's perfect will you know I think God's perfect will is for us to be United to be together not to be cold amen amen we're a church we're a team we're a family and the message the same the same message say the queen of actually no the queen of the South it says now many people get the wrong conception of Jonah we we try saying he's a Jonah brother says I'd like to stop just for a minute Jonah was no bad person he was a real man of God there's nothing happens provincial to a true real true servant of God how many can say Amen it all works together for good to them that love God and Jonah was commissioned to go to Nineveh but that ship going to Tar I want you to pay attention wasn't the relief to the least resistance I don't know if you get that tonight Church wasn't the relief to the least resistance you know the message tonight is called resisting the will of God you know know and I believe that sometimes we resist what God has in store for us we try we try to tend to do things our own way but God has a different way for us it's not our way it wasn't the relief to the least resistance I believe that many of the times we try to find relief on some other things we try to find relief with our car our phone our work is that true Jonah you know Jonah was a very special person you know and throughout the scripture of chapter 1 2 3 and four you know in in the chapter two Jonah makes a prayer to God you know and remember that Jonah was already in the well in the belly of the well and he makes a prayer to God you know and God found favor in that prayer you know because God is a god that is merciful god is a god that is gracious God is a god that is giving us time he's given us borrow time cuz we're we're on borrow time brothers and sisters brothers we're at we're at the end of time there's not much time left so why are we still in the condition that we're in so so God found favor in in his in his prayer you know and throughout the the story of Jonah you know Jonah was commissioned to talk to Nineveh brother Brown says that it was a city of millions of people now can you imagine yourself going to Denver and God tells you I need you to tell the people to repent how many here would do it I think it'd be pretty hard correct you know but this is what Jonah had to do he was commissioned to do something it was God's perfect will to to go to for him to go to Nineveh you know and one of the things that got got Jonah mad you know was that when he gave when the message reached the king for the people to pretty much repent you know the Bible says that they everybody put on sackcloth even the animals now sa Claus is something that back then if not mistaken the Israelites it's usually made of black black goat hair it was used by the Israelites and their neighbors in times of mourning in times of mourning yes you know and the people did so you know and and God forgave the people of n but but Jonah questioned his mind how could God forgive people you know and then he thought into himself you know Jonah knew that God was a gracious and forgive forgive he remembered that God had forgiven Jonah you know and I believe that tonight you know God has found favor in us God had God sees something in you that the world can never see you know it only takes a little bit of Faith brothers and sisters you know to be able to do the perfect will of God because you have to trust God you have to trust God with the plan that God has for you amen amen I'd like to finish with this quote from Brother Bram and the message perseverance and if Jonah under those circumstances could have could have that much faith in God what about you brother brother Brown says that no one has had it harder than Jonah and I can show you what brother Bram says there's none of you here that bad under the circumstances so brothers and sisters let's aim let's aim yeah let's aim to do the perfect will of God let's ask God for guidance and not take that road that Jonah took not try to find a solution to something that God already has in store for us or try to find a different Road or a different path God bless you brothers and sisters God bless you Brothers the precious name of Lord Jesus Christ I see you very serious I'm making questions another day a young man asked me are you going to preach and I told him if I'm PR questions make questions so that you don't sleep glory to God our brother Timothy took a very important scripture that God spoke in my heart to speak is about recognizing it's a very small word can put it up on the projector that word that word recogniz that's his fault to recognize that something's your fault that's not easy focus on that word Brothers it's so important if you can read it there recognize Now read it backwards right left to right it says same way to left and back why Co no God isn't a god of coincidence that word is there so we can recognize when we're the problem how don't we like to recognize when they're the problem I don't like your brothers but we need to recognize glory to God myself there Brothers many how many struggling that there's a lot of us right glory to God continue talking on the character of Jonah we're gonna read in Jonah chapter 1 verse one if you may please stand Brothers so you can rest from sitting read the word of God says like this now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Emi saying arise go to n that great City and cry against it for their wickedness has come up before me Hallelujah but Jonah rose up to flee unto tares from the presence of the Lord and went down to Joba and he found a ship going to tares so he paid the fair thereof and went down into it and go with them unto tares from the presence of the Lord glor you may be seated Brothers we're seeing here that Jonah was a prophet right can a young man tell me question how many know what a prophet is the mouth of God the other other day they told me when we were here brother that we should preing away all the children and understand sometimes I preach make it down so everyone can understand so we know brothers that a prophet is a mouthpiece of so Jonah was a prophet he God spoke personally to him and what did he do when God spoke to him he disobeyed correct he said go to gy and he took to some other place how many times have we done the same how many can identify I identify with Jonah brothers because many times they told me don't do this and that's the first thing I do he thought he was fleing from the presence of God can we flee from the presence of God Psalms 139 shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence if I Ascend up into heaven thou are there so God covers wherever you are wherever you want to hide you're never going to be able to hide from God and that's a good thing because many times we're doing bad things Jonah was disobeying dis beinging God but God was with him how many of us Brothers when we're in the world we're doing bad things we're fleeing from the presence of God and God was with us can say because that time where I was fleeing from your presence you were there with me GL glory to God blessed God you can see here that Jonah was fleeing from God he went and slept I'm going try to go here quickly it says God sent a storm they used to pray to they used to cry out to their gods they were crying out to their gods GL glory to God to get dead Gods blessed God in Psalms 1155 their Idols of of silver and gold their works of men they have mouths but do not speak they have eyes but do not they have ears yet they have no smell they have hands they have feet but do not walk they don't speak with their throat similar to the we have mouths correct say glory to God all those Sailors were there crying out to the gods they false gods are dead Gods true God was sleeping glory to God what happened this night church where they have dead Gods worshiping their God where we have the truth you have given reation thank you because we have the message of the hour should we not be thankful Brothers glory to God there was Jonah sleeping says the captain went to woke wake him up what are you doing claim to your God to your God but he did not know that God the only God but Jonah knew Jonah recognized what was the problem but what did Jonah say he said well I'll get up cast me to the sea cast me to the sea Jonah didn't know that God had prepared a fish it's than do the will of God I'd rather a fish didn't know he had that trans God wanted to take [Music] him all things work for good you will say I went to the world the will of God didn't want you to go to world I wanted if we say that God wanted us to go to the world then the word of God is contradicting itself blessed is the man who did not wied do you know the word of God brothers so God gives us permissive will his permissive will the word left me God gives us the free will not that we go out there it's the permissive will God allows us to the world and dirty ourselves up and when we come back many times we value salvation tell you young man go to the world so you know what's good that's a lie the devil to go to the world tell you I went to the world and I'm fine and now I know what the mercy of God is that's not true Brothers true because I was in the world God took me out of the world God why didn't I know you earlier done so many things that I did wrong scars healed the wounds healed but Scar and the Devil comes and reminds you and keeps telling you what you did but Hees and that blood is for us cleanses us all can say glory to God glory to God Jonah was there he was cast into the sea and even those who cast into the sea were afraid to do so you all know the story that fish him three days and three nights and he was there and he did not die he had oxygen I'm not sure how that how that went but it was God there God was to take him take him where he wanted to take him many of the times Brothers we're fleeing from the presence of God sooner or later if we're his seed we to get to that place glor glory to God I can imagine there I can I can imagine Jonah among so much in the belly of that will because everything that that will would rot in there how would Jonah be fighting against all that how would you want to be I believe Brothers as he was taking care of Daniel he would not beated by all those gases from the whales that's what I think that's what I believe and God was taking care of him because someone rest so long without breathing he was there three days and three nights so was God taking care of him so there Brothers when Jonah when the fish sped him out brother the fish the God it was the will of God for the fish to spit him out time com out I just wanted to make a quick question this is a general question how believe that was eaten by a fish believe that Jonah was eaten by a fish I read something about brother BR beautiful and I want to share with you because I thought it was beautiful beautiful and I hope you can capture this and everyone a little girl one time I believe brother rean said this in four while Tabernacle a little girl was saved and she was coming up from the street she had the Bible in her heart and she was simply singing [Music] with her with her face Happ and she was singing you can imagine that Brothers was happy it says that this young lady was happy going around along said saying the Lord I'm happy and said are you saved Sav me and I'm happy are you saved question she found another person are you safe old man that was an unbeliever standing and they came and asked why are you so happy when they why are you so happy why because Jesus saved me I was baptized win souls because Jesus I was in the world I had no right toal life but God died for me said Jesus saved me oh I'm happy are you saved he said there's no such thing that's all you know about it well do you believe that that book do you have in your hands she had the word of God sir I believe all of it with the Holy Spirit he asked do you imagine that about Jonah the big yes sir I believe it's surely true how can you believe other than faith I was inside the World perhaps brother Jonah will not be what was he trying to say that if it's not in heaven where will it be in purgatory in hell so the young lady okay said okay Jonah's in heaven I'll ask him there heaven and if he's in hell this other unbeliever God bless your brothers amen God bless you Brothers it's a blessing to see each and every one of you tonight amen if you could please stand and open your Bibles to Psalms 18 when you have please say Amen the title for tonight is resisting God's will if there's one good thing that if there's one thing that we're good at that is resisting God's will fleeing from God's will you see because as human beings we must recognize that we have a sinful nature and this sinful nature a desire for the things of this world sinful nature Aire for Pride all of these things but thanks be to God that he's taking care of us amen the word says like this in my distress I called upon the Lord and Cried unto my God he heard my voice out of his Temple and My Cry came before him even into his ears amen you may take your seats amen how great is God God's love you see even when we might be in the times of distress times of Trials God is always listening and he is always willing to listen to us because he wants to help us amen amen tonight we are focusing on Jonah the prophet Book of Jonah is one of the most extraordinary books in the Bible you see the Book of Jonah it might be a small book only four chapters you see but I believe that the Book of Jonah shows the compassion and unfailing love that love that that God has towards his children you see in Jonah 1 verse one it shows that the word of the Lord came to Jonah saying arise and go to n and cry that great City and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me now the city of nineve you see Brothers the city of nineve wasn't a small City you see no brothers you see the Bible says that it was a great City it was a big city you see but this city of nineve was in was deep in sin it was a perverted City you see brother Bram says n was a gentile City that worshiped animals and idols and you see n's God was the god of the sea which was the whale and God here SS Jonah to cry out against this city you see but Jonah 1:3 says but Jonah rose up to flee unto tarish and went down to jopa and he found a ship going to tarses so he paid the fair thereof and went down into it to to go with him Onish from the presence of the Lord so here we can see that instead of going to where God instructed him to go here we can see that instead of going to n to preach to the people of repentance we see that Jonah chooses to run away from God a man running from God's presence think about that Brothers a man running from God's presence you see this man was a prophet too this might s this might seem and sound bad but brothers and sisters the more that we think about this the more that we understand this story the more that we will see and recognize that we are just like Jonah we're so much like Jonah Brothers you see there's always a little bit of Jonah in US you see Jonah is an example for all of us you see each and every single one of us including myself you see we are always running from something we are always running from something you see brother brandham says we are always running from something we run from troubles we run from responsibilities we are prone to do that if we could be honest tonight and if we could be honest tonight sometimes we run from God's presence but we don't recognize it now maybe tonight you could think that you don't do it you see but God knows your heart you see Brothers how many times we arrive to church and left church the same how many times have we arrived to church spiritually dead without any blessings with the same condition that we were how many times have we arriv to church physically like right now like right now how many times have we arrived to church physically but our minds are outside of church Desiring to do something else Desiring to do something that isn't of the Lord Brother sisters youth we are living in a Time where the things of this world social media addictions Pride Idols these secul artists and all these fascinating things are separating us from God's love you see we are living in a time where our own desires the desires of our flesh are separating us from the love of God you see our our flesh likes to flee from the word of God you see our flesh our flesh loves to run away from God's presence if we could all be honest tonight I don't know if any of you are listening tonight it is easier for our flesh to do our routine work it is easier for our flesh to spend hours on social media scrolling hours away easier for our flesh to listen to these secular artists you see it is youth it is easier for our flesh to give most of our day to our own desires how difficult it is how difficult is it is for our is it for our flesh to pray every morning every night how difficult is it for our flesh to read and meditate in the Bible in the word oh Brothers our flesh doesn't care if we spend countless hours out in the world hours out there there doing perverted stuff our our flesh doesn't care Oh but our flesh trembles when you want to dedicate at least 30 minutes of your day to God why because the flesh fle from the presence of God you see when God told Jonah to go and give the message of judgment to the N I believe that Jonah was scared to confront the people of nin you see Jonah didn't want to go to nin you see brother Bram says Jonah what was asked to go to a gentile City to cry out against him thinking that he would not be received because the Gentiles would think what's this Jew got to do with us you see so Jonah with all these reasons all these excuses you he chose to flee from God Jonah with all these excuses to not go where God wanted him to go see the Bible says that Jonah rose up to flee to tares from the presence of the Lord Jonah was running away from his responsibility you see Jonah couldn't face his responsibilities and in the same way Brothers we can't face our responsibilities God has given us a responsibility in this world God has given us a responsibility in this world to separate ourselves from this world to act different from this world you see but it seems like it's hard for the Youth separ themselves because maybe they don't want to lose their friends maybe they don't want to lose their reputation maybe they don't want to lose their status their popularity and because of that we choose we choose to flee from our responsibil you see we have to understand God is sometimes going to ask ask us to do things that we don't want to do God is going to ask us it's going to ask us to get out of our comfort zone you see because it seems like we're comfortable tonight it seems like we don't have to worry about anything tonight you see but I know brothers that we need a change you see Brothers youth we get too comfortable with the things of this world we rely too much of the things of this world you see why Brothers you see when Jonah went down into the ship into this ship thinking that he could Escape God Jonah thought Jonah thought that he could go he could go the easy way fre from God you see but God never promised us that this life was going to be easy you see God God is going to send storms God is going to send send trials God is going to send some things that in our perspective is seems like God doesn't care about us oh but Brothers we are blinded we are blinded see God is trying to get our attention God is trying to get our attention and I don't know if he has your attention tonight I want to tell you tonight you see brother brandham said that Jonah took an easy ship and went down a tar he went down in the hole of the ship and went to sleep he took the easy route the easy way you see but by the grace of God Brothers God send a storm to straighten up Jonah's path you know what youth sometimes God needs to send a storm to us sometimes God needs to send a storm in our lives so that he so that he can get our attention you see sometimes God needs to send that storm in our lives to shake us up a little bit times God needs to send that store in our Liv so that he can put us in the right path you see Brothers we let our flesh we let our flesh dictate what we do we let our flesh and our thoughts us see we come to church Wednesday Friday Sunday week by week by month you see but we can't let God move in us we close our hearts our hearts are so hardened to the point where we don't want that fellowship with God but we choose to flee from God you know Brothers these past few months I've been struggling struggling spiritually I felt separated from God I was imprisoned by my own thoughts and desires the devil got a good hold of me throughout these past months and I was bound by my own flesh I did things that I knew that I shouldn't I shouldn't be doing but yet I did it I told God that I wouldn't do certain things but yet I would do it and at some point I had to recognize that I was spiritually dying and the same way the same way I know that there are people here that maybe are bound by chains maybe tonight Brothers you are bound by your own desires by the the your own flesh you see Brothers we are in need of a change I know I need to change if you may please stand God wants to use us each and every one of us it's no coincidence that we're here you see it's no coincidence that you're in this place right now you see God could have chosen other people to replace you you see but God chose each and every one of you God chose you before the foundation of the world you see I don't deserve to be here you see Brothers I betrayed the Lord many times I've lied to the Lord many times in youth we close ourselves too much from the presence of God God wants that fellowship with us God wants to spend time with you God wants you to open those doors but our hearts are too cold why cuz we free from God why do we run from him when he is all that we need he is all that we need Brothers you see the Bible says that when you recognize that God is all that you have then you could then you will know that God is all that you need you see our flesh desires this world this flesh desires the things of this world oh but youth brothers and sisters not just the youth but every brother and sister in here we don't have to stay in the same position that we are in we don't have to stay in the condition that we are you see the same the same power that Rose God from the dead that same power in US you see how we have a we have a decision tonight we have a decision tonight do we want to leave different or do we want to leave the same brother Bram said and a man running from the presence of the [Music] Lord preached in 1965 then we can't run from it [Music] nowhere he'll be right there just the same you can do it you see by his provided Prophet the one he ordained to go down there and call that message now looked like he could have sent another another Prophet but he ordained Jonah you see Brothers God could have ordained other people God could have replaced me with a better person you see because I feel I'm the worst sinner in this world I don't deserve his love I don't deserve his Mercy oh but Brothers when God when Jonah was in the belly of that whale I believe that he was in his lowest points he was in the lowest deepest point but even at his lowest point even in the time of his Affliction and distress God heard his [Music] prayer if God heard the prayer of a man that was in a belly of a whale how much more can God do for us tonight God promised us that he was going to give us a better future you see God knows what's best for [Music] us this world has nothing for me this world will never satisfy me there's only one person that will be able to satisfy your heart that is the Lord Jesus Christ you see Brothers the Lord when he opens doors no
