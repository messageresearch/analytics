[26:25] seats the title of tonight's message
[26:30] with our brother VI and our brother
[26:33] Alex the extraordinary
[26:36] life tell your neighbor the
[26:38] extraordinary
[26:40] life because my
[26:42] Jesus your Jesus lived an extraordinary
[26:47] life the devil wants you to live
[26:52] ordinary the devil wants you to be
[26:55] common the devil wants me to be common
[26:59] my
[27:00] Jesus your
[27:02] Jesus put the
[27:05] extra in the
[27:07] ordinary he came to show
[27:09] me that I can
[27:11] also put the
[27:14] extra in this ordinary
[27:17] life that the devil wants me to
[27:20] live he wants us to be part of the
[27:24] multitude he doesn't want us to stand
[27:27] out
[27:29] he wants us to be like the common
[27:33] folks why do you want to stand
[27:36] out why do you want to live an
[27:37] extraordinary
[27:40] life my Jesus showed me
[27:43] why it's so
[27:45] important to give the
[27:48] extra the extra
[27:50] mile cuz that
[27:53] extra big or
[27:55] small makes the difference
[27:59] a
[28:01] millisecond makes a difference between a
[28:05] win giving that
[28:09] extra cuz my Jesus like I
[28:12] said the center of it
[28:14] all the perfect example of every
[28:16] Christian
[28:19] Life it's not
[28:21] impossible God Almighty made
[28:25] it he did it for you and me
[28:29] use an example
[28:31] today do you believe that
[28:33] church do you believe that Jesus Christ
[28:35] lived the life that you and I can live
[28:40] also I believe it I believe that he we
[28:46] can with the Holy
[28:48] Ghost amen amen you know thinking on
[28:53] this you know last Friday they preached
[28:55] on the
[28:57] wine
[28:59] A great
[29:00] miracle but this tonight we want to take
[29:03] it in the
[29:05] angle of of of the journey if we can
[29:10] say that our Jesus Christ went
[29:13] through from The
[29:16] Trial that he went through to get to
[29:18] this
[29:21] great this extraordinary
[29:25] life but in an extraordinary life
[29:30] is not built upon
[29:35] mediocrity I'm going to say it again in
[29:38] an extraordinary
[29:40] life is not based upon
[29:46] mediocrity how can you expect great
[29:49] things from something you don't put
[29:51] effort
[29:54] in you don't care enough about
[29:59] and thinking on
[30:01] this the God gave me the the the it came
[30:04] to mind when brother Brandon talks
[30:08] about when he talks about in the Jewish
[30:12] Traditions how they have an adoption
[30:16] ceremony you know how when the father
[30:19] adopts his son
[30:22] back and comparing this to our lord
[30:26] Jesus you know brother talks about it in
[30:28] the message hear ye
[30:31] him look it
[30:34] up and he talks about how this young
[30:38] man when he's born in a Jewish
[30:43] Family he is born with certain
[30:48] privileges not when he's born right
[30:52] away but later
[30:54] on but there is a process there is a
[30:58] journey that that young man has to go
[31:01] through to be able to obtain those
[31:04] privileges those blessings that his
[31:06] father has for
[31:09] him and the same thing our Lord Jesus
[31:13] Christ had to go
[31:15] through he went through exactly
[31:17] everything that you and I go
[31:21] through Tri that you go through he went
[31:23] through it every test he was tested he
[31:26] went through it
[31:30] and comparing it to this young
[31:32] man brother bham Compares when he's
[31:37] born he connects it to being born
[31:41] again are you with me Church don't be
[31:44] distracted with our brother Diego over
[31:48] here let us focus on
[31:50] tonight don't focus on me focus on God
[31:55] on God's word CU I'm going to fail
[31:58] you God words ain't going to fail
[32:02] you now brother B says in the message
[32:04] hear ye
[32:06] him like I said he Compares when the
[32:09] young man is
[32:11] born to the being born
[32:14] again and I believe we all want to be
[32:16] born again
[32:18] right one two okay people want to be
[32:23] born all right we all want to be born
[32:25] again
[32:26] amen
[32:29] but it's crazy to think that brother
[32:31] brandham
[32:33] says there's still more to
[32:36] that there's still more to
[32:39] that he says right here but because that
[32:43] you are born
[32:46] again that doesn't mean all of
[32:49] it all of it I'm getting to my point
[32:52] right here you just become a
[32:56] child you become become a member of the
[32:58] body of
[33:00] Christ but that doesn't mean that you're
[33:02] living in your privileges
[33:08] yet you're not living there
[33:12] yet and then our Prophet says and that's
[33:14] what's the matter with the with the
[33:15] people
[33:21] today what's wrong with the world they
[33:23] are living under the
[33:26] Privileges
[33:28] because they think that when they were
[33:30] born again that settled
[33:36] it oh Brothers just think about that
[33:38] picture
[33:39] that what if Jesus Christ just stopped
[33:42] right there when he was
[33:45] baptized when the Holy Spirit came
[33:48] down and the father said this is my son
[33:52] and who pleases me to dwell
[33:56] in what if you St
[33:59] there what if he didn't give the
[34:02] extra the extra that gave him that
[34:05] extraordinary
[34:07] life what about you what about me what
[34:12] if we don't give that
[34:14] extra that allows us to have
[34:17] access to those
[34:20] privileges come on now Church
[34:23] who want
[34:26] theives give the ex
[34:28] [Music]
[34:30] exra do what my body doesn't want to
[34:33] do against my human
[34:37] thinking human
[34:39] reasoning go the extra
[34:42] M body doesn't want you to
[34:46] do cu the devil like I
[34:48] said he wants you to be
[34:52] ordinary but my
[34:54] Jesus can help you get the
[34:56] extraordinary
[35:01] he says that only puts you in position
[35:04] for every Divine promise that God made
[35:08] right there in
[35:17] this being born again ain't it
[35:21] only now start to think
[35:24] this I put myself here when I thought
[35:26] this
[35:32] I know I'm not born again
[35:38] yet but if brother brandom says that
[35:42] doesn't settle
[35:45] it this puts me in in
[35:48] uh it scares
[35:51] me how much more I got to
[35:55] go and I think that I'm
[35:59] okay I think the way I am is okay right
[36:04] now my daily routine as a Christian is
[36:11] okay but thanks be to
[36:13] God that he sends his holy spirit to
[36:17] us comes in a still Small
[36:21] Voice so still that you may confuse it
[36:24] with your own
[36:26] voice
[36:28] and telling you
[36:29] that that's not
[36:32] it there's still
[36:35] more there's still more for
[36:37] you this Chill on your back is not
[36:42] it Friday Wednesday and Sunday is not
[36:45] [Applause]
[36:47] it you
[36:50] and the extra
[36:56] my our Pastor said it
[36:59] once he said it in a message the devil
[37:02] knows
[37:04] you preaching in
[37:07] 2019 he says I've said to the
[37:11] youth you think you're
[37:13] fine because you compare yourself to the
[37:17] rest and say well at least I'm not like
[37:22] her at least I'm not as terrible as
[37:26] him I'm not doing things that are that
[37:31] bad but he says but the reason
[37:36] why waiting for me to just simply give
[37:40] away to
[37:42] me how how is he going to give all his
[37:47] riches All His
[37:50] blessings if I don't take care of
[37:53] them if I don't care for them it's like
[37:56] our pastor
[37:58] said oh it's easy for us to let go of
[38:00] what God has given
[38:02] us you
[38:04] question why am I way I
[38:08] am why am I where I'm
[38:10] at it's because
[38:13] truly I recognize
[38:15] it I still haven't given that
[38:20] extra cuz my question
[38:23] is who wants to live a life
[38:28] without a
[38:35] purp
[38:37] you how you
[38:39] act the way you live does that identify
[38:43] you as a Son of
[38:45] God are you giving the
[38:48] extra I have to recognize it I Haven it
[38:53] lately I have it I want to give the
[38:56] extra
[38:58] tonight tonight this Friday night I give
[39:03] the
[39:04] extra allows me to
[39:07] enter basic in
[39:10] ordinary doesn't doesn't need
[39:13] much it just simply needs a humble
[39:18] heart
[39:20] recognizes that without him my life is
[39:25] pointless ordinary
[39:30] tonight God bless
[39:35] you God bless
[39:38] everyone uh if we could open our no I
[39:41] just I just love speaking about
[39:43] him uh it reads like this Matthew 4:1
[39:48] 17 for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand
[39:51] and go
[39:56] ahead
[39:59] and Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee
[40:02] saw two brothers Simon called Peter and
[40:06] Andrew his brother casting a net into
[40:08] the sea for they were
[40:20] fishermen then he said to them follow me
[40:24] I will make you Fishers of Men
[40:32] they immediately left their Nets and
[40:33] followed
[40:38] him uh you know when we talk about
[40:42] Jesus uh you know we were talking about
[40:44] his
[40:46] temptation uh and uh you know um brother
[40:49] Marshall and brother uh Brother G did a
[40:51] great job last
[40:55] week you know I like the way they
[40:57] brought it
[41:00] amen uh but uh you know when uh we uh
[41:03] look at
[41:05] Jesus and you know the first thing that
[41:07] he
[41:09] does uh you know when he uh when he
[41:12] overcomes the Temptation
[41:16] amen uh you know the first thing he does
[41:18] is uh he he he speaks the
[41:23] word amen amen that's the way God does
[41:26] things amen
[41:28] you see the world the way the world was
[41:31] created was that God God spoke the
[41:35] word amen so when when Jesus overcomes
[41:41] Temptation he spoke the
[41:44] word you know when we look at at at what
[41:46] he
[41:48] did you know his first
[41:51] words were
[41:54] repent it just because the kingdom of of
[41:57] Heaven is at
[41:59] hand you see he never deviated from the
[42:04] Worden amen if you look at at the
[42:07] message that John the Baptist
[42:10] brought it was the same
[42:14] message that Jesus
[42:16] brought you see you see John John the
[42:20] Baptist was a prophet
[42:22] amen and and and
[42:24] Jesus and Jesus just said what the proph
[42:29] said you know and I think that's the
[42:31] that's the calling for our
[42:34] day because God doesn't
[42:37] change you see we should
[42:39] say of what the prophet said
[42:43] amen I believe that I don't know if you
[42:47] do but the Bible tells
[42:50] me that we should preach what the
[42:52] prophet
[42:54] preaches and that's exactly what Jesus
[42:56] did
[42:59] he just spoke the
[43:00] word you see when the we're here we're
[43:03] here to we're here to break heart
[43:09] hearts that's right oh you know we worry
[43:12] about you know healing them later
[43:15] amen we have a God that heals
[43:18] too because there's a lot of hearts that
[43:20] are
[43:22] hardened we have a
[43:24] God we have a God that that specialize
[43:29] in in breaking
[43:31] hearts tell my God's a
[43:35] heartbreaker amen amen I believe that I
[43:38] don't know if he's if he's broken your
[43:41] heart but you know when he breaks
[43:44] them you know he he strengthens them as
[43:47] well
[43:47] amen he does the same he does what he
[43:51] does amen
[43:53] amen I I I believe it 100%
[43:59] you know one of the things that brother
[44:01] Gustavo was talking
[44:02] [Music]
[44:03] about was you know that extraordinary
[44:07] life you know it's it's one of those
[44:10] things you know brother brandham says
[44:14] this you know he's talking about fathers
[44:16] and
[44:18] mothers he says and the father and
[44:20] mother he says it in he says it in the
[44:23] message come follow
[44:26] me
[44:27] he says praying
[44:30] constantly that their son would not turn
[44:32] out just an ordinary
[44:36] man that he'd be an extraordinary
[44:40] man all parents want
[44:43] that you see all the parents want
[44:47] that and then he says this in the next
[44:49] in a few paragraphs
[44:52] down and that's the ambition of every of
[44:55] any parent
[44:59] to do the best for their child that they
[45:02] can educate them or give them things
[45:06] maybe that they wasn't able to
[45:09] get and he says that's the way I feel
[45:11] about my
[45:14] children brother Brandon wanted the best
[45:16] for his children as
[45:18] well he didn't want him to be
[45:21] [Music]
[45:22] uneducated he wanted to get he wanted to
[45:25] give them the best that he could
[45:28] but one thing he didn't
[45:30] want is that he didn't want them to be
[45:34] ordinary you know and I I believe you
[45:37] know that that's what separates the son
[45:39] or daughter of
[45:41] God is that they weren't
[45:44] born to be
[45:47] average and they weren't born to be just
[45:49] common
[45:52] people I believe it
[45:54] 100% you see when I stopped believing
[45:57] the lies that the world told
[46:00] me there was a
[46:02] time in my life where I believed what
[46:06] the world told
[46:08] me I believed everything they
[46:12] said but you know when I when I when I
[46:15] listened when I heard God's
[46:17] word I realized it was all
[46:21] alive the Bible says let man's word be a
[46:25] lie
[46:29] and God's word be the
[46:32] truth and that's why we're
[46:34] here because the
[46:37] truth when it is
[46:39] received in the heart it has an
[46:44] effect not not just not just by hearing
[46:48] it but you know by bringing it to
[46:51] life but when it is quickened inside
[46:55] of something more than just make you
[46:57] have feel
[47:00] something it it
[47:02] stimulates it stimulates you to do
[47:06] something amen
[47:09] amen I
[47:12] believe you know uh and brother brandham
[47:15] says this
[47:16] actually he says it in the message uh
[47:20] preparation he says that the greatest
[47:23] miracle that God ever
[47:25] performed
[47:29] is when he took a
[47:32] sinner and made a Christian out of
[47:35] him that is the greatest
[47:39] miracle that there could ever
[47:42] be and and then he also says
[47:45] this if you want to see a
[47:49] miracle you need to become a
[47:52] miracle that's what he
[47:54] says you see and and and I'm just going
[47:57] to keep going now because time's
[48:00] advancing but when
[48:02] Jesus you know begins to preach his
[48:06] message you see he goes into a
[48:09] place that that is a very unique and
[48:13] odd he didn't stay
[48:15] home he didn't stay in
[48:18] Nazareth but he went into the darkest
[48:21] the
[48:23] places he went to ceram if I'm not
[48:25] mistaken
[48:28] and you know and
[48:30] there it says the people sat in
[48:36] darkness they were just sitting there in
[48:39] darkness it was something
[48:41] common for them to live that
[48:45] way and you know have you ever been
[48:47] around
[48:48] people they don't know anything about
[48:52] God they don't know anything about they
[48:54] have they have no perception or anything
[48:57] of of of what God
[49:00] is and you know you go into their home
[49:04] perhaps and it's just it's just a little
[49:07] bit odd to
[49:09] you because they don't
[49:12] understand of what the light actually
[49:16] is amen amen but Jesus goes into a place
[49:20] like
[49:22] this and he brings the light
[49:28] he he brings a
[49:30] revelation amen
[49:33] amen that's what that's what the Bible
[49:37] says but the thing that catches my
[49:42] attention is uh you know who he goes
[49:47] to he goes to some common
[49:52] folk he goes to some
[49:55] fishermen you know uh and and he catches
[50:00] them well he he they have they're
[50:03] they're in a net they have a
[50:07] net and uh you know they're two brothers
[50:09] Andrew and
[50:11] Peter and and and he also uh the other
[50:15] pair he goes to is uh um um the sons of
[50:18] zebede John and
[50:25] James and and but you know the thing of
[50:27] it is that they were
[50:30] fishermen you see so they they they
[50:32] handled
[50:34] Nets you know but I want to bring it to
[50:37] our
[50:39] time because I believe that there is
[50:42] Nets in our time as
[50:45] well the problem
[50:47] is H you've actually been caught up in
[50:50] the wrong
[50:55] net
[50:57] amen how many believe
[51:00] that we we live in a
[51:02] day where you know the biggest thing
[51:06] around is the
[51:10] internet and you know the thing of it
[51:13] is is that instead of you being caught
[51:16] by the gospel
[51:20] net you are caught up in the
[51:25] internet
[51:27] amen and the thing of it is you don't
[51:31] know how to get
[51:33] out amen amen that that is the
[51:37] truth you see you are so caught
[51:40] up in all of those
[51:42] things that there is no
[51:45] time for the gospel
[51:48] net how we have
[51:52] Netflix we have
[51:54] Hulu I don't have to name you know about
[51:58] them but the thing of it is is that you
[52:01] are
[52:03] trapped you are caught
[52:05] up in this
[52:07] net and you don't know how to get
[52:13] out but there is a way
[52:16] out amen amen and his name is
[52:21] Jesus that
[52:23] connection don't look for the internet
[52:26] connection
[52:28] look for The Jesus
[52:31] Connection he'll show you the
[52:35] way he'll bring you
[52:42] out these men living an ordinary
[52:47] life you know from one moment to the
[52:51] next their life was
[52:54] interrupted you know people don't like
[52:57] for their lives to be
[53:00] interrupted especially probably their
[53:02] social network
[53:05] life you know you try to take a phone
[53:08] away from them and you know you'll see
[53:09] what
[53:12] happens you know but the thing of it
[53:14] is is that you know you get so caught up
[53:17] in these
[53:19] things but what I what I what I can see
[53:23] here is that when we talk about this
[53:28] net is that God God he he actually wants
[53:34] people they know how to work the
[53:38] net now we got to work the right
[53:42] one and we are
[53:44] here uh because of the Gospel
[53:47] net amen amen you see and that's the
[53:51] net that is the that is the priority
[53:55] here see but but we see
[53:58] here that the lives of these men were
[54:02] disrupted and when we look at the when
[54:05] we look at the scripture
[54:08] here it says then he said to
[54:11] them in verse
[54:14] 19 follow
[54:16] me and I will make you Fishers of
[54:21] Men you see when he says
[54:24] that he's not asking
[54:27] them he he's telling them he's giving
[54:30] them a
[54:32] command he says that I will make
[54:35] you you see some of us
[54:38] here you know God wants to make you
[54:42] something he wants to make
[54:45] you more than a common
[54:48] person he wants to make
[54:51] you something
[54:53] bigger something greater he wants to
[54:57] make
[54:57] you and what you never thought you could
[55:02] be you see some of us here but we think
[55:05] we're
[55:09] selfmade we think that we're
[55:12] Sade that we own
[55:17] ourselves but but I
[55:19] believe that I was
[55:22] bought bought by the blood of
[55:25] Jesus and he owns
[55:28] me all of this it's
[55:31] his you see everything I
[55:34] have it is
[55:39] his verse
[55:42] 20 the Bible
[55:44] says they
[55:47] immediately left their
[55:50] Nets and followed
[55:53] him you see they immediately left
[55:58] no questions
[56:00] asked no
[56:02] doubts no
[56:04] reasoning but they just dropped the
[56:07] nest I tell you
[56:10] this you can drop your
[56:13] nest you can drop your
[56:16] addiction you can drop your
[56:20] sin drop your
[56:23] pornog drop your shame
[56:27] you can leave it
[56:28] all at the feet of
[56:33] Jesus you can leave
[56:37] it the question
[56:39] is will we leave
[56:43] it where will you leave
[56:45] it will you leave it in your truck when
[56:47] you come in
[56:50] church or will you leave it in your
[56:53] purse or will you leave it hidden
[56:57] so that you can come back
[56:59] to but what are you going to
[57:02] do what what you're dealing
[57:06] with you can finish
[57:09] it you can leave
[57:11] it this
[57:13] evening at the feet of
[57:17] Jesus what will we
[57:21] do with what we have right

[57:39] forward God
