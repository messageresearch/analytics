[19:46] foreign
[19:50] [Music]
[19:57] [Music]
[20:10] [Music]
[20:13] tonight
[20:19] foreign
[20:55] [Music]
[20:56] that yours
[20:59] [Music]
[21:00] is
[21:03] [Music]
[21:25] foreign
[21:32] [Music]
[22:54] open up your Bibles to the Book of
[22:55] Joshua chapter 13 verse 1.
[23:01] I'd like to thank my beloved Pastor yeah
[23:06] giving me the trust to preach to his
[23:09] his congregations
[23:13] alongside with these Great Men of God is
[23:24] and the word of God says like this is
[23:27] now Joshua was old and striking in years
[23:30] and the Lord said unto him
[23:37] our old and striking in years and there
[23:40] remains yet very much land to people's
[23:43] death
[23:46] [Music]
[23:48] amen let us go to our Lord in prayer
[23:52] so you can bless us in this evening
[23:57] gracious and bountiful father uh um
[24:03] Lord what more can we say but thank you
[24:07] Lord we don't deserve to be here Lord
[24:11] we don't deserve to have this church
[24:15] we don't deserve to have a great Pastor
[24:18] um
[24:19] we don't deserve everything that we have
[24:21] in our lives
[24:24] our
[24:26] life itself but yet bike race
[24:31] a gift undeserving
[24:34] if we can simply have that in our minds
[24:38] and bring it down into our hearts
[24:41] then Lord I believe that you can bless
[24:44] us
[24:45] because only in the right mentality Lord
[24:49] and in the right Spirits
[24:52] is when your Holy Spirit can come down
[24:57] dig deep within our hearts
[25:01] unveil our deepest Secret foreign
[26:15] satisfaction isn't enough
[26:19] I want you to listen to that one more
[26:22] time
[26:24] satisfaction isn't enough
[26:28] because I believe in a sense of way
[26:32] satisfaction does not exist in God's
[26:34] vocabulary
[26:38] satisfaction means
[26:41] satisfaction significa pleased or
[26:43] content is
[26:45] with what has been experienced or
[26:48] received
[26:51] I'm gonna say it again
[26:53] please
[26:56] what has been experienced or received
[27:01] starting the story of
[27:05] did a beautiful job last week
[27:10] but the story of rake
[27:12] and the Battle of Jericho
[27:15] and as you continue on with the story of
[27:17] Joshua
[27:19] we know that that was not the only
[27:21] battle he had
[27:24] he went through all have greater battles
[27:28] after he faced Jericho
[27:35] after that you can see that Joshua at
[27:39] times would face five kingdoms this was
[27:44] at one time
[27:47] in some occasions he even fought 15 to
[27:50] 20 Kingdoms at a time
[27:57] and one could say
[27:59] wow that's something very tremendous
[28:02] something that you can maybe show off
[28:07] and say you know this is what I did but
[28:13] many times
[28:15] we put God's plan which is foreign
[28:19] [Applause]
[29:15] it's never gonna be enough for my God
[29:18] cause my God is always looking for more
[29:22] because he know there's more there's
[29:26] more things than there's things of the
[29:28] world
[29:29] you may be satisfied with coming to
[29:31] church every Friday every Sunday every
[29:33] Wednesday
[29:36] but our Prophet Taurus is not only that
[29:39] Federal Way
[29:41] it's not just being satisfied with
[29:44] hearing a beautiful preachings
[29:47] it's not enough to hear
[29:50] quotes being read
[29:54] but it's up to us
[30:00] desire higher things
[30:04] desire to be used by God even more
[30:08] because
[30:10] if the devil Diablo he'll get us in the
[30:14] mentality
[30:17] [Applause]
[31:02] it says but the children of Israel
[31:04] committed a trespass in the curse things
[31:11] I see
[31:23] and the tribe of Judah took of the
[31:26] current things and the anger of the Lord
[31:29] was kindled against the children of
[31:31] Israel
[31:36] tomorrow
[31:41] now here Aiken after the Battle of
[31:44] Jericho
[31:45] God has commanded and told Joshua to
[31:48] tell the people of Israel
[31:51] [Music]
[32:42] [Music]
[32:48] this is a gun when he took that little
[32:51] wedge and that babylonic garments
[32:57] he presumed
[33:00] it never be seen
[33:03] well what's that it's just an old little
[33:07] old garments
[33:11] I'm just gonna take five ten minutes on
[33:14] my social media
[33:16] [Music]
[33:20] oh I had a great service on Friday
[33:24] Saturday's coming I'm gonna watch a
[33:26] movie at night
[33:29] I'm gonna take some time for myself
[33:33] I'm just say it again
[33:40] satisfactions because God knows what
[33:44] we're capable of love
[33:45] and then I'm gonna tell you this the
[33:49] devil knows what work
[34:03] he knows that he can stop us
[34:07] he can stop us from receiving the true
[34:10] promise
[34:13] a True Deliverance
[34:16] haven't you found yourself
[34:19] you feel good for a Time
[34:22] hey you're doing right with the Lord
[34:28] yourself slipping away
[34:33] and it's not a big change from one day
[34:37] to another
[34:39] it's the small little things you do
[34:42] you start pushing yourself away from God
[34:46] stop fellowship with him as much
[34:55] or convincing yourself
[34:58] I've done enough
[35:07] there was so much still to conquer oh
[35:10] much
[35:14] [Applause]
[35:18] ahead of us
[35:20] who we have the next service
[35:34] tomorrow
[35:36] that's what I'm trying to get at it
[35:39] enough is enough
[35:41] [Music]
[35:42] to have a mediocre Christian Life
[35:46] we were never called to have a mediocre
[35:48] Christian alive
[36:02] but that's only one portion of the
[36:04] promised land
[36:07] calls to just possess we were not just
[36:10] only called
[36:13] one portion of Our Lives
[36:15] God gave us the gift of the Holy Spirit
[36:24] get on the ground all the ground that
[36:27] we've given the devil lately
[36:29] [Music]
[36:31] we're giving them our time
[36:34] we give them our minds
[36:37] and many times we've given them our
[36:39] hearts
[36:42] but we can come to realize
[36:46] we could come to realize
[36:49] that everything that we have
[36:53] by far
[36:55] by far is by the grace of God is
[36:59] Not By Your Works
[37:03] fortify the pleasing your grace of God
[37:11] and I believe that's what that's the
[37:14] mentality
[37:15] of an overcomer
[37:19] because
[37:23] this is the land of the Overcomers
[37:28] it's battle after battle
[37:31] but yet like Joshua
[37:34] knowing his possession
[37:37] knowing what he was called foreign
[38:14] I don't have it it says this is what God
[38:18] wants for his church
[38:21] God wants a church with Revelations
[38:26] so we can know the devil's tactics
[38:29] and now to overcome them
[38:33] because the devil knows now listen to
[38:37] this
[38:38] he knows he can't fight against us
[38:52] when you are your full capacity
[38:56] and then he says
[39:02] and the only way that he can beat us is
[39:07] when we start to drop our guards
[39:12] how do you know you're starving you you
[39:14] started drops like your guard foreign
[40:29] [Applause]
[40:35] Victoria
[40:39] that's the only way
[40:41] we can't do it our own
[40:46] they're still over here
[40:52] where I've tried to do it on my own
[40:57] if I could say it
[40:59] a self-righteousness
[41:02] [Applause]
[41:04] I try to sanctify myself
[41:09] but I can't clean myself
[41:12] can I pour myself
[41:16] I can't pour myself
[41:24] it's a personal Affair
[41:29] what you have with God
[41:36] but tonight
[41:39] we can have that one thing in our mind
[41:43] the satisfaction isn't enough yes is
[41:47] that is
[41:50] then I think I can do something with us
[41:53] tonight
[41:59] [Applause]
[42:08] foreign
[42:12] God bless you brothers and sisters I'm
[42:15] very happy to be here tonight
[42:19] amen the Lord is good amen ameno hey man
[42:23] let's read that verse again Joshua 13 1
[42:26] verse
[42:29] and says now Joshua was old and stricken
[42:32] in years and the Lord said unto him Thou
[42:35] Art old and strict engineers and they
[42:37] remaineth yet very much land to be
[42:39] possessed
[42:48] as you know our title it's
[42:53] um
[42:55] sorry Brothers I'm a little nervous hold
[42:57] on
[43:02] status
[43:04] saddest being satisfied isn't enough
[43:06] sorry
[43:08] and as a subtitles
[43:11] I put the devil's greatest gratified
[43:14] satisfaction
[43:19] and gratified
[43:21] um the definition that I found for
[43:23] gratified
[43:25] it says to be a source of or give
[43:28] pleasure or
[43:29] satisfication to
[43:33] the star satisfaction contento
[43:36] satisfaction contento
[43:39] or give pleasure
[43:41] and as we see here
[43:44] um we see Joshua or God told Joshua
[43:46] Josue that there still remaineth much
[43:49] land to possess
[43:52] and a lot of the times
[43:55] we let the devil Diablo we let them
[43:59] think we let him tell us that we should
[44:02] be satisfied with what we have all right
[44:07] we let him lie to us
[44:10] we try we let we end up gratifying the
[44:13] devil
[44:15] we end up pleasing him
[44:18] please in him the way we walk
[44:21] the way we talk the way we live the way
[44:25] we dress
[44:27] and we're just gratisfying we're
[44:29] gratifying the devil is
[44:32] you know I heard something today
[44:35] and a preaching
[44:37] and I said
[44:40] um brother Burley Williams said it he
[44:43] Emmanuel Williams Bernie William Nico uh
[44:46] maybe a lot of the youth know him
[44:48] he said the devil would try to follow
[44:51] you he said
[44:56] uh
[44:59] the devil tried to defile you and to
[45:02] defile it means to corrupt the Purity or
[45:05] Perfection of it
[45:11] and if he can to follow you
[45:15] then he will blend in with you
[45:18] because the devil knows how to act as a
[45:21] Christian as well
[45:28] you see brothers and sisters
[45:31] if the devil can't defile you
[45:35] can't corrupt you you can't take your
[45:39] Purity away
[45:41] you'll start blending in with
[45:43] you'll start coming to church with you
[45:46] we all know the devil's the first one
[45:49] here
[45:50] so he'll be here before
[45:53] you'll be seated next to you it doesn't
[45:56] know a lot of those things who even
[45:57] raised his hands before you raise your
[45:59] hand
[45:59] foreign
[46:30] you're not truly having an experience
[46:31] with the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:34] they're here by force
[46:39] you're here because your parents come
[46:42] Saturday you're here because what will
[46:44] the brother say if I don't go
[46:49] you're raising your hands
[46:51] just to raise them
[46:53] and I say that because I've done that
[46:56] before
[46:58] sometimes the preacher will be going on
[47:01] and sometimes you get caught off guard
[47:03] and just raise your hand for no reason
[47:07] and you're like why did I raise my hand
[47:11] and we honestly don't even know why we
[47:13] raised our hands but
[47:17] um and he kept saying that as he's going
[47:20] on through the preaching
[47:22] this is barely talking still as well
[47:25] he says you see the devil wants you dead
[47:29] but he'd rather have a bachelor in
[47:31] Christianity
[47:37] if we see Samson
[47:40] you see they didn't kill him
[47:43] they had him as a sport
[47:46] they rather laugh at a Christian
[47:50] and not be able to laugh at you at all
[47:53] you see the devil would rather have you
[47:57] backsliding little by little
[48:01] be making fun of you
[48:04] have you in his hands
[48:19] amen amen
[48:21] you see uh my dad shared this
[48:24] um verse with me in the back
[48:28] you see we have to be transformed
[48:30] Brothers
[48:31] we read in Romans 12 2
[48:36] it says and be not confirmed to
[48:39] conformed to this world
[48:42] but be ye transformed by the renewing of
[48:45] your minds
[48:52] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[48:57] you see Brothers foreign
[49:21] is transformed by the renewing of your
[49:23] mind
[49:28] we need a renew it
[49:31] and I just want to read um I
[49:35] want to read this
[49:38] quote by our brother Branham
[49:42] God commissioning Moses
[49:45] reaching 53.
[49:48] it says
[49:50] you got to get determined determinado
[49:54] that's right get ready
[49:57] take over God said so let's go take over
[50:04] that's what God wanted us to do
[50:07] that's what God wants us to do tonight
[50:11] God's always willing to give us
[50:14] if we're ready to receive it
[50:16] that's right guys
[50:19] so it's ours
[50:22] the promise is unto you yeah
[50:25] to your children to them that fought to
[50:29] them that's far off
[50:31] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[50:34] call
[50:35] so the promise is here
[50:38] see Brothers
[50:41] um a lot of the times muchas versus and
[50:44] also this is something that my dad
[50:46] shared with us in the back as well
[50:49] and it really touched me
[50:52] um because he said
[50:54] lot of the times muchas versus
[50:57] we like to just be called Christians
[51:00] cristianos you're satisfied with being
[51:02] called a Christian is
[51:05] actually living the Christian Life uh
[51:13] we're like oh we're called the
[51:15] Christians so we're Christians
[51:18] when reality Brothers
[51:21] we're not really living that Christian
[51:23] lives
[51:25] and I keep saying Joshua and Caleb
[51:29] when they went over
[51:31] I like that they thought I like that
[51:34] they thought there
[51:36] when they came over the ten come the ten
[51:40] come back and said
[51:42] oh we look like grasshoppers
[51:45] up the side of them and Joshua and Caleb
[51:48] said we can do it
[51:50] that's right
[51:53] God promised we could do it
[51:56] God said we could do it God promised our
[52:00] fathers that we was going
[52:03] that was our land and that belongs to us
[52:07] no matter if they get all cities
[52:58] because we haven't fully received the
[53:01] promise
[53:04] amen amen
[53:06] and it keeps saying
[53:09] all things are subject to Jesus Christ
[53:14] and all things are subject to you in
[53:17] prayer
[53:19] when you ask in his name and believe
[53:23] see Brothers we have the answer right
[53:26] there
[53:28] we have the answer
[53:32] you see it's when we believe
[53:35] we ask God In Prayer
[53:38] we have the promise we will see what we
[53:42] asked

[1:00:01] after what we asked
[1:00:04] after that it's up to God
[1:00:11] what we want from him
[1:00:14] let's stop
[1:00:18] and let's be transformed brothers
[1:00:22] and have a renewing of our mind
[1:00:31] foreign
[1:01:36] verse 3.
[1:01:43] it is saying it says like this is
[1:02:00] and they returned to Joshua Joshua and
[1:02:03] said unto him let not all the people go
[1:02:05] up but let about two or three thousand
[1:02:07] men go up and smite I.E and and make not
[1:02:10] all the people to labor thither but for
[1:02:13] they are but few it is
[1:02:20] so there went upstairs of the people
[1:02:23] about 3 000 men and they fled before the
[1:02:25] men of AI
[1:02:27] God bless his word amen so
[1:02:42] [Music]
[1:03:14] and the Bible says
[1:03:20] um
[1:03:21] foreign
[1:03:28] and the people of Israel were defeated
[1:03:33] and further I had the Bible it says
[1:03:47] and fell to the Earth upon his face
[1:03:50] before the Ark of the of the Lord until
[1:03:52] the evening Israel
[1:03:57] he and the Elders of Israel and put dust
[1:04:01] upon their heads and Joshua said
[1:04:06] foreign
[1:04:22] but to God we had been content and dwelt
[1:04:25] on the other side of Jordan
[1:05:15] was shared
[1:05:38] and all the goods that he had
[1:05:43] if I would just put this into our time
[1:05:49] you're just a satisfied
[1:05:53] we are satisfied with so little
[1:05:59] I went to the altar yes
[1:06:02] the service was for me
[1:06:06] it was very very impressive
[1:06:09] we become containers
[1:06:14] you want more of God
[1:06:19] the hundred leaves us
[1:06:23] for you Lord
[1:06:25] it comes and goes
[1:06:32] a month ago
[1:06:36] and I had forgotten one word
[1:06:42] Mano I was speaking with the brother not
[1:06:44] that long ago
[1:06:47] that the word of God
[1:06:49] the message
[1:06:53] for him it was an addiction
[1:07:00] really what brother Branham tells us
[1:07:04] and I remembered it I I said that's the
[1:07:06] truth
[1:07:11] is
[1:07:18] sometimes
[1:07:21] two things we should not be addicted
[1:07:26] in social media we're so wrapped up in
[1:07:30] social social media Sports
[1:07:37] we're not addicted to his word
[1:07:42] is
[1:07:46] through my brother
[1:07:48] okay
[1:07:50] that we have to be addicted
[1:07:53] to the word of God
[1:07:56] and not be satisfied with so little
[1:08:00] the word of God says that Jesus
[1:08:05] Jesus in the Canaanite woman
[1:08:08] the Canaanite woman
[1:08:11] she went to Jesus
[1:08:17] he did not even even pay attention to it
[1:08:21] and then
[1:08:24] in the word of God it says
[1:08:30] Jesus and then he answered that's what
[1:08:33] that's what Jesus said
[1:08:38] I was not sent but to the lost sheep of
[1:08:41] Israel
[1:08:42] that's right and he said
[1:08:47] on her face and she said uh Lord uh help
[1:08:50] me yes
[1:08:52] and he answered and said
[1:08:58] it's not good to give the loss of the
[1:09:01] children and and give to give and she
[1:09:05] said
[1:09:06] yes Lord
[1:09:12] but even the dogs eat of the crumbs from
[1:09:15] from the table of their owners
[1:09:19] and then Jesus answered a woman
[1:09:27] to you according to us at what you
[1:09:30] desire
[1:09:32] and her daughter was healed at that hour
[1:09:35] it's not fair that faith
[1:09:38] and perseverance
[1:09:41] that person didn't
[1:10:00] I can't give it to the dogs
[1:10:07] eat of the crumbs
[1:10:20] did we not have a dedication
[1:10:25] otras
[1:10:26] denominaciones that's the other
[1:10:29] denominations
[1:11:10] so okay you know what is
[1:11:12] even though
[1:11:14] are more dedicated
