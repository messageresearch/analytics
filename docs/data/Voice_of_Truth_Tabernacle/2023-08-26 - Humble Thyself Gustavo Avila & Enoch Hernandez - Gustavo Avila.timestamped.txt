[20:28] Amazing Grace
[20:31] [Music]
[21:17] but by love and grace and mercy
[21:21] I didn't have to not and we don't have
[21:25] to you I think that's what the devil
[21:28] tries to tell us
[21:30] and confuse us
[21:33] that we have to okay there's a price
[21:36] that has to be paid
[21:38] it's already been paid amen
[21:42] let's go to the word of God
[21:44] [Music]
[21:50] and it came to pass when the king of
[21:53] Israel had read the letter that he rent
[21:55] his clothes and said am I God to kill
[21:58] and to make alive that this man doeth
[22:01] sin unto me to recover many of his
[22:04] leprosy wherefore consider I pray you
[22:07] and see how he seeketh a quarrel against
[22:09] me okay
[22:17] is
[22:26] and it was so when Elijah the man of God
[22:29] had heard that the king of Israel had
[22:31] rent his clothes that he sent to the
[22:33] king saying Warfare has thou rent thy
[22:36] clothes let him come now now to me and
[22:40] he shall know that there is a prophet in
[22:42] Israel I
[22:55] and he shall know that there is a
[22:57] prophet in Israelites
[23:00] let us go to the author of the word
[23:03] Amado
[23:08] what more can we say but thank you
[23:11] by grace alone so we stand here together
[23:17] it's not a coincidence but
[23:21] it's up to the one
[23:24] come seeking
[23:27] thirsting Hungary ambriento in the right
[23:31] mindset and like the solo mental correct
[23:34] and then the correct atmosphere
[23:36] we create our own atmosphere fathers
[23:40] in this evening we want to create an
[23:43] atmosphere with you
[23:46] but in order for you to be in it
[23:53] so tonight
[23:54] let's put our burdens
[23:58] our jobs
[24:00] our day-to-day things
[24:02] and right here right now
[24:05] forget about them
[24:07] we can't worry about them right now
[24:10] we can't put part about it right now
[24:12] because our eternal life depends
[24:17] take control of me take control of my
[24:21] brother
[24:21] and we ask you to take control of your
[24:24] people
[24:26] in your holy name we pray Ramos amen
[24:30] amen
[24:44] [Music]
[24:47] I
[24:52] didn't really know who I was preaching
[24:54] with
[24:57] but out of everyone I could have talked
[25:00] to about
[25:02] first about me speaking on Friday
[25:07] was my brother Enoch
[25:11] and how is it that he's the one I'm
[25:14] preaching with
[25:17] and that for me was God's confirmation
[25:19] yes
[25:21] that God is uh supporting him backing us
[25:24] up amen
[25:28] are you here do you want to be here who
[25:33] was forced to be here
[25:35] no one okay well there's one
[25:39] but it's okay it's all right sometimes
[25:42] of course
[25:45] it's a good thing that our parents push
[25:47] us to do things
[25:51] do good things do things we don't want
[25:55] to do sorry
[26:15] I don't know I don't know we don't have
[26:17] a title per se with our brother Enoch
[26:19] but
[26:20] no we didn't have time to talk about it
[26:23] but we're most about started
[26:25] I'm just going to Simply put a subtitle
[26:28] if I can say
[26:30] the correct approach
[26:34] correct the correct atmosphere
[26:37] [Music]
[26:38] this message is the way to get what you
[26:41] need amen
[26:45] this message
[26:49] it tells you what you need
[26:52] where to find it and how to get it
[26:55] that's
[27:04] what is the Holy Ghost
[27:07] and he has another message what was the
[27:09] Holy Ghost given foreign
[27:29] but why can't we come at it
[27:33] why do we come at it
[27:37] with a basic mentality
[27:42] a common thing
[27:44] a common approach
[27:47] I'll see what happens
[27:50] I'll see what it has for me
[27:54] only can a supernatural encounter
[27:58] with God can change our lives
[28:01] and this is
[28:04] a supernatural message
[28:07] amen amen that produces Supernatural
[28:10] things
[28:12] and why do I treat it like the common
[28:15] thing in my life
[28:18] tonight I know next week something's
[28:21] coming for us
[28:25] I don't think it's coincidence
[28:28] God put this in my heart
[28:31] and my brother Enoch share his thought
[28:34] with me
[28:36] and God changed my message
[28:40] why do I need to enter
[28:44] into the correct atmosphere
[28:47] correct why do I have to
[29:05] [Music]
[29:14] in a way
[29:18] really wanting it this we read in the
[29:22] book right now in second Kings chapter
[29:23] five
[29:27] we find the character of Naaman amen
[29:31] I don't know how many know that story
[29:33] though
[29:35] neyman was a man
[29:38] a chief a captain sorry of the Syrian
[29:42] Army amen
[29:44] and we know that name it had leprosy
[29:48] and again I'm just gonna summarize it
[29:50] and then
[29:52] there was a maid
[29:54] foreign
[30:27] and it came to pass when the king of
[30:29] Israel had read the letter that he rents
[30:33] his clothes and said am I God to kill
[30:36] and to make a life
[30:48] to recover a man of his leprosy
[30:50] parakeets
[30:53] I feel like many of us can find
[30:56] ourselves
[30:59] like the king of Israel almost
[31:02] thinking it's of us
[31:06] thinking that this message is has the
[31:10] though in this scenario
[31:13] that this message was directed to him
[31:18] or capture what I'm trying to say this
[31:21] letter was sent to the prophet amen it
[31:24] was not meant for the king
[31:28] but the only way to connect to the to
[31:30] the prophet of God
[31:33] was to send the letter to the king but
[31:38] many times you find like ourselves like
[31:39] the king of Israel
[31:42] thinking that it's up to us
[31:46] but it's not up to us
[31:48] we can't produce healing
[31:51] the prophet of God himself said it he
[31:53] cannot produce healing
[31:56] but it was God in him amen
[31:59] but it was the way he approached God
[32:03] the atmosphere the way he prepared
[32:06] himself
[32:08] that he was able to obtain
[32:11] that healing
[32:13] obtained that salvation for those that
[32:17] desire
[32:18] but again many times
[32:21] we forget it's not of Our Own Strength
[32:26] it's of gods
[32:29] but like again the devil
[32:54] that should help you in your situation
[32:59] I thought you were progressing in God
[33:02] and why are you finding yourself in the
[33:05] conditions
[33:07] because we must know and understand
[33:11] it's not of us it could never be of us
[33:16] because if it was up to us
[33:19] and Jesus Christ would have never needed
[33:21] to die
[33:23] he would have to do everything he did
[33:25] for us
[33:26] but we must come and recognize that
[33:31] we have nothing of ourselves
[33:34] we're unworthy
[34:00] [Music]
[34:35] atmosphere natural
[35:02] [Music]
[35:28] but don't look at me I don't know me I
[35:32] don't have nothing I'm just simply an
[35:34] echo our pastor's an echo
[35:39] but it's up to us
[35:41] what type of approach we come
[35:46] what type of attitude
[35:48] and depending on that attitude
[35:51] depending on their atmosphere that we
[35:53] created
[35:55] will depends
[35:57] will reveal himself or not to you
[36:02] now I want to go to the message the
[36:05] supernatural
[36:07] again I have nothing new to you
[36:11] but what I'm trying to get at tonight
[36:13] [Music]
[36:16] it's needed
[36:19] sometimes we go through things in life
[36:21] hardships
[36:27] to change our mentality
[36:29] to change our approach
[36:32] brother Brown says in the message of
[36:35] Supernatural
[36:38] he says notice this little lady she had
[36:41] told him to go to the prophet is
[36:49] he went over to the king foreign
[37:12] something that sounds sweet to my ears
[37:17] but we have a message
[37:20] that only through this message
[37:24] can a new birth be be made
[37:28] only a new person can happen through
[37:31] this message
[37:34] he says and the King didn't know nothing
[37:37] about Divine Healing brother Branham
[37:38] says
[37:40] are you with me are you understanding
[37:43] what the prophet is saying here
[37:45] and the King didn't know nothing about
[37:47] Divine Healing
[37:49] he didn't know anything about certain
[37:52] certain things
[37:53] well he didn't know that there was a
[37:55] prophet in the land
[37:58] that could perform Miracles
[38:00] he didn't know nothing about it
[38:03] though he was supposed to be in
[38:06] Israelites
[38:09] circumcised yes but you see
[39:10] can you stiff
[39:27] like a
[39:31] basic basic word
[39:37] but God deals with us each and every one
[39:39] of us differently
[39:42] many are called
[39:44] if you are chosen
[39:47] do you want to be chosen
[39:49] it all depends on what atmosphere
[39:53] how you approach this is
[39:58] if God shows himself tonight to you
[40:01] I can't do nothing for you
[40:07] it's all up to you
[40:08] it's all up to you
[40:12] this is directly to us
[40:15] continues reading and saying
[40:18] and when he gets to this letter
[40:24] he reached and got his garments and tore
[40:26] them up saying
[40:29] am I God to make man alive
[40:33] or to kill he said I want all of you
[40:37] I want all of you to take notice this
[40:40] man is picking Coral with me you see it
[40:47] thank God for a prophet
[40:50] yes he shows us more
[40:53] he says to the world it only tears him
[40:57] up
[41:00] he says see he didn't live under and I'm
[41:03] thinking he's saying under the
[41:05] atmosphere
[41:09] he was a professed Israelites
[41:17] confessed Malachi 45 believer
[41:22] but he thought that the days of Miracles
[41:25] was passed
[42:04] that we have an angel in this place
[42:08] that sacrifices himself every day
[42:12] to live in the correct atmosphere
[42:16] to live the right life for us
[42:20] to show us that this message still lives
[42:24] it's still alive
[42:27] whether you want it or not
[42:30] people
[42:34] but he says there's many people today if
[42:36] a prophet says
[42:38] that doesn't know that Jesus Christ is
[42:40] still alive
[42:43] I think that many of us
[42:46] it's me sometimes I forget that he's a
[42:49] living God
[42:51] they don't know that he ruled he still
[42:53] rules and Reigns The Prophet says
[42:57] they don't know that the blood of
[42:59] Calvary for all is sufficient
[43:02] is
[43:04] he purchased at the cross for our
[43:07] transgressions
[43:33] get in
[43:51] then why hasn't your life changed
[43:56] why am I a dog
[43:59] going back to my vomits
[44:02] eating the same vomit day after day
[44:06] there's nothing wrong with God's word
[44:10] what's wrong is with our attitude
[44:13] our approach
[44:16] how we approach it
[44:19] I come to think of The Prodigal Son
[44:23] nothing was different
[44:25] everything around it was the same
[44:28] the only thing that changed was him
[44:31] the scripture says he came to himself
[44:35] his approach
[44:38] his attitude
[44:45] he came in an attitude
[44:48] recognizing reconaciendo he was unworthy
[44:54] recognizing reconaciendo yeah he was
[44:57] blessed beyond all measure
[45:01] and that he had taken advantage of that
[45:04] yes
[45:08] that happens to us that happens to me
[45:12] I read this I hear this message
[45:15] hear the the prophets I hear his words
[45:22] and I don't take advantage
[45:25] I truly don't let it cut me okay
[45:31] cut me deep okay
[45:37] because only this message will show you
[45:41] truly what's wrong with you
[45:43] and it will tell you
[45:46] how to fix it
[45:49] and truly
[45:53] we've been here for Years
[45:55] yet I still don't understand
[45:59] I still don't understand it all I don't
[46:01] know well at least try
[46:04] to believe it try to believe it's for
[46:08] you
[46:09] put your ego down for one second
[46:12] I need to put my ego down for just one
[46:15] second
[46:16] and be honest with myself
[46:19] foreign
[46:49] everything
[46:51] God bless you
[46:55] [Applause]
[47:07] live in New York God bless each and
[47:10] every one of you
[47:15] um
[47:32] we have a time to talk about it
[47:36] we're practically in the same thought
[47:39] it is the most area layers is
[47:44] I like to read and if you just stand up
[47:46] so you could rest
[47:49] Second
[47:50] Kings
[47:52] five verse 10.
[47:55] this is like this is
[48:09] and Elisha said the messenger unto him
[48:11] saying go in Washington Jordan seven
[48:13] times and thy flesh shall come again to
[48:15] thee and thou shalt be clean
[48:17] in a month
[48:30] but neyman was Roth and went away and
[48:33] said behold I thought he would surely
[48:36] come out to me and stand and call in the
[48:38] name of the Lord his God and strike his
[48:40] hand over the place and recover the
[48:42] leper
[48:43] you may be seated
[48:48] yeah
[48:52] we find here in second Kings chapter
[48:55] five
[48:56] important a very important man
[49:01] that had won a position as a general
[49:07] the Bible says he was the courageous man
[49:09] without any opposition he had he was a
[49:12] man with the position
[49:14] but he he was a leper
[49:19] leprosy has always been something
[49:20] shameful
[49:22] it was something shameful for him
[49:29] we see that this uh this young lady
[49:38] and she told she told her her
[49:43] the woman that she served
[49:52] this is the name it goes to the king of
[49:55] Syria
[49:56] and he talked to him about his case
[50:01] he told her what the what this mate had
[50:03] had said to him
[50:06] and he sent a letter to the king of
[50:09] Israel Israel
[50:15] the king of Syria sent a letter to the
[50:17] king of Israel
[50:20] and we see the occasion house as our
[50:23] brother Reddit
[50:25] where the king of Israel says
[50:30] to heal this man of leprosy he is
[50:34] incredible
[50:52] he didn't know that he had a pastor
[51:01] he didn't know that even in his time the
[51:04] Divine Healing existed because
[51:08] he knew his life was in danger
[51:14] and the king of Syria could declare war
[51:18] he rent his garments
[51:23] when Elijah found out about this
[51:27] this is why have you tore your garments
[51:33] [Music]
[51:35] so he sends uh for naming to come forth
[51:43] and when Naaman comes to the house and
[51:46] and to the door of Elisha
[51:49] he has a concept of what is going to
[51:52] happen
[51:56] he has a concept of how God is going to
[51:58] work in him
[52:02] or how he thinks it's more convenient
[52:04] for him
[52:08] but when things don't happen as he
[52:11] thought they would
[52:12] it hurt his pride
[52:18] it hurt his ego per se
[52:24] and he became discouraged
[52:28] in cambiograce
[52:30] but in return he received a messenger
[52:32] yeah
[52:38] and this messenger told him to go to go
[52:41] wash himself in in the Jordan seven
[52:42] times and he would be healed of the
[52:44] leprosy
[52:46] even the response he received from the
[52:48] messenger was offensive to him
[52:59] [Music]
[53:02] there are rivers that are better than
[53:05] this cleaner
[53:08] but his servants
[53:12] they had a better Revelation than he
[53:14] himself did and they told him
[53:18] if he would ask the greater thing of you
[53:22] would you not have done it
[53:26] and that made him reflect
[53:29] look youth
[53:32] is
[53:34] that happens to each one of us
[53:38] throughout our lives
[53:42] we begin to understand no knowledge
[53:46] learn knowledge
[53:48] which is the the weapon of Satan it
[53:51] comes
[53:52] and as we are walking
[53:56] we begin to think that we know it all
[53:59] right
[54:49] and then you begin to challenge your
[54:52] pastor supadre your father is
[54:55] the head of the home
[54:59] and the head of the church is the pastor
[55:03] as when the scripture tells us
[55:09] remember your creator in the days of
[55:11] that youth is
[55:16] what we focus so much on the youths
[55:22] same mistakes that we made
[55:24] right
[55:28] we find ourselves here in this position
[55:31] here
[55:33] we're naming new nothing of the Lord
[55:39] he wanted to be healed
[55:43] but he went to the wrong person
[55:46] many times
[55:53] to ask for the wrong counselor or advice
[56:00] the Holy Spirit
[56:03] is
[56:04] a seed
[56:06] it's a seed
[56:08] plantando de Generations that is planted
[56:12] from generation to generation
[56:42] to another man of God foreign
[57:31] think for a moment
[57:35] yes
[57:36] is importante that's why it's important
[57:39] said
[57:43] the problem in these days
[57:46] is it there's so much
[57:48] yeah in church
[57:51] they go and they study La Biblia the
[57:55] Bible
[57:57] before being born again first foreign
[58:12] be born again
[59:00] see how important it is
[59:03] I said car say
[59:05] s
[59:07] to approach with the right attitude in
[59:09] the right atmosphere
[59:12] doses so here is name it
[59:15] is
[59:17] and he doesn't hear the answer he wants
[59:21] to hear
[59:23] I recall one time
[59:29] that a couple approached brother Garcia
[59:38] I do not agree with this relationship
[59:42] this relationship
[59:44] what joins you is sexual is is sex
[59:50] he as a pastor obligation the obligation
[59:54] to tell them to his members
[59:58] what he saw of the relationship
[1:00:22] through their pastor is more important
[1:00:26] it's very important imperative it's very
[1:00:29] it's very important
[1:00:38] when you approach the Holy Spirit
[1:00:40] through the man
[1:00:44] don't expect to hear what you have is an
[1:00:47] answer already
[1:00:53] what you're expecting for him to tell
[1:00:56] you
[1:01:17] imagine if we knew the future of the
[1:01:19] youth
[1:01:21] we will tell them
[1:01:23] but we don't know it
[1:01:27] is
[1:01:29] we can see at the present time yes
[1:01:33] that's how we try to help the youth
[1:01:42] and he goes and he washes himself seven
[1:01:44] times
[1:01:46] and he is cleansed of his leprosy
[1:01:50] because of the obedience
[1:01:53] to the pastor no to the word
[1:01:58] because the prophet is the mouthpiece of
[1:02:00] God
[1:02:02] it wasn't obedience to the pastor
[1:02:04] foreign
[1:02:10] many of you have heard my testimony
[1:02:16] there were things that I did not see of
[1:02:18] myself
[1:02:19] and when the pastor told me
[1:02:23] he who exalts himself shall be shall be
[1:02:26] humbled
[1:02:27] and you humbles himself shall be exalted
[1:02:32] he said I won't speak with you I wanted
[1:02:36] to speak with him
[1:02:37] he said I won't speak with you because
[1:02:41] I was sinned for you
[1:02:55] and
[1:03:04] this is how I'm treated
[1:03:07] father dedicated my life a life yes and
[1:03:11] then this is how I'm treated
[1:03:51] much feels
[1:03:56] I began to think of those same words
[1:03:59] that he had told me
[1:04:04] that when he said
[1:04:10] I was I was summing for you and then
[1:04:15] I understand it was the Holy Spirit
[1:04:17] speaking through him
[1:04:19] that had told me my condition
[1:04:22] because
[1:04:23] I did not humble myself
[1:04:28] I had to go through a very painful
[1:04:30] process
[1:04:32] seven years of my life wasted
[1:04:36] so that I could get to a condition
[1:04:39] where I can understand
[1:04:41] that without him I have nothing
[1:04:45] I thought I was
[1:04:47] yeah it was filthy rags
[1:04:58] [Music]
[1:05:18] out of it
[1:05:23] that's why youth
[1:05:26] is
[1:05:27] listen to the voice of God
[1:05:32] to the voice that God has given us
[1:05:35] the angel that God has given you foreign
[1:05:53] did
[1:06:02] if you would just please stand
[1:06:09] the story of Elijah is very beautiful
[1:06:14] the prophet says
[1:06:18] Elisha had a good teacher
[1:06:31] now one of us has an excuse
[1:07:21] a thousand times again
[1:07:30] seek first your new birth Andes but for
[1:07:34] anything else
