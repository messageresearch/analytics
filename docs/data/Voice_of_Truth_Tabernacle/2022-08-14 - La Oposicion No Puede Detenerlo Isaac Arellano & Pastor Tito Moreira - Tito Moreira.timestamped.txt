[32:52] [Music]
[32:55] god bless you this morning
[32:59] it's a it's a pleasure to be here
[33:02] on a sunday morning
[33:07] i would like to have for you
[33:15] we'll be uh opening the word to ezra
[33:17] chapter
[33:22] four as you read it we send greetings to
[33:25] those who are watching through the
[33:27] internet
[33:28] los armanos in california mexico in
[33:30] california and in mexico
[33:51] weak in the hands of the people of judah
[33:52] and troubled them in the building
[33:58] we're going to be uh having a short
[33:59] prayer para celestial heavenly father
[34:02] thomas gracias
[34:04] i want to thank you
[34:33] my interpreter
[34:38] control
[34:39] the mind of the hearers as well
[34:45] what i would speak would be of
[34:46] edification
[35:17] the opposition can't
[35:19] uh
[35:20] overcome the opposition
[35:24] and
[35:25] this morning i want to focus on
[35:27] discouragement
[35:31] a little of the back story just to
[35:33] refresh your mind
[35:37] the work stopped in the house of the
[35:41] lord laura in
[35:57] some of the things that i found out
[36:02] is that
[36:03] the measure of greatness in a person's
[36:05] life
[36:09] the measure of the greatness of anyone
[36:11] you can think of even yourself
[36:18] is measured it is medieval by what it
[36:21] takes to discourage us
[36:31] and we know he was a great man
[36:34] because it took a lot to discourage him
[37:08] just like the temple stop
[37:13] and then the voices that come into our
[37:15] mind
[37:18] also discourage us
[37:20] they
[37:35] discouraged discouragement
[37:37] causes people to feel defeated
[37:41] and want to give up
[37:44] for
[37:45] the lord in their lives say that again
[37:48] they want to give up for the lord
[37:53] they want to give up what they're doing
[37:55] for the lord
[37:57] and if it's not for the lord
[38:00] he wants to give up what they're doing
[38:01] for themselves
[38:42] and the word of god says that god is
[38:55] so you don't think you're the only one
[38:57] discouraged this morning
[39:09] [Music]
[39:11] by god's grace i'm here
[39:14] and a couple of examples so we don't
[39:16] feel alone
[39:20] moses ran away from egypt with
[39:22] discouragement
[39:25] elijah the great man that caught fire
[39:30] at some point he wanted to die
[39:35] job was discouraged when he saw his
[39:36] children dying
[39:41] and i feel like the biggest
[39:43] discouragement that a person could face
[39:45] in my shoes
[39:51] i identify with the apostle peter
[40:08] discouragement is what leads us to
[40:10] hopelessness
[40:16] and the enemy
[40:18] of our soul
[40:20] loves to do that
[40:50] and i
[41:04] the devil can use that very simply
[41:06] brother
[41:09] and now can you imagine these people the
[41:11] people of israel
[41:14] doing what the lord told them to do
[41:18] us
[41:30] and you feel very strong about something
[42:23] you know
[42:25] and all we're seeing is a horrible time
[42:42] just not in a
[42:55] then sees the work of the house of god
[42:57] which is at jerusalem so it's seized
[42:59] unto the second year of the reign of
[43:01] darius king of persia
[43:10] del rey
[43:24] they had
[43:35] remember that the one that sent them was
[43:37] king cyrus
[43:42] but now there's been three kings since
[43:44] then
[43:48] and obviously building a temple is not
[43:50] from day to night it takes years
[43:56] and as you know they write a letter to
[43:58] artist xerxes saying these are a
[43:59] rebellious people don't let them build
[44:06] a
[44:20] working
[44:22] this is god's doing is this
[44:25] they went to jerusalem
[44:27] originally under ezra
[44:31] and by the leadership of the lord
[44:46] uh
[45:16] and
[45:23] a little bit of work here a little bit
[45:24] of work there
[45:27] there's some stone sitting here yeah
[45:57] and this is where haggai the prophet
[45:59] comes in
[46:04] and if we can turn to haggai
[46:10] and i'll be starting my message
[46:15] in the second year of darius the king in
[46:17] the sixth month the first day of the
[46:18] month came the word of the lord by
[46:20] haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the
[46:22] son of shaltil governor of judah and to
[46:24] joshua the son of josedic the high
[46:26] priest saying
[46:44] thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying
[46:46] this people say
[46:48] so notice
[46:49] god is saying
[47:29] they hired counselors now indeed they're
[47:31] attorneys
[47:45] these people are saying the time has not
[47:49] come for the lord's house to be built
[48:01] human life is that we come before
[48:03] obstacles
[48:18] but sooner or later we run into
[48:19] obstacles
[48:22] and some of us might say
[48:26] i've said
[48:28] well i guess god didn't want me to do it
[48:44] and the people of israel were
[48:46] shut down of the lord's temple
[48:54] and so they might say
[48:58] if i was back there i could have said
[49:13] and putting the blame on god
[49:18] putting the blame on god
[49:22] for the fact
[49:24] they're not going forward and doing what
[49:26] god told them
[49:43] uh argenized
[49:45] the time hasn't come for the lord's
[49:47] house to be built
[49:51] the time hasn't come to surrender my
[49:53] life
[50:10] pleasure
[50:12] and it's hard to abstain from pleasure
[50:18] amen i'm in and aren't we really good
[50:22] aren't we really good
[50:24] that when we
[50:37] we do it in a way of convenience
[50:50] because we're running into
[50:53] because we're running into opposition
[50:56] now if you follow me to 2nd timothy 3.
[51:01] paul telling timothy
[51:06] and all that will live godly in christ
[51:08] jesus shall be happy
[51:14] [Music]
[51:19] is that what it says
[51:20] this hassle
[51:30] difficulties trials challenges
[52:02] we should just consider
[52:15] is open unto me and there are many
[52:17] many words
[52:22] let's say it all together many
[52:24] adversaries
[52:26] adversaries the apostle paul saying that
[52:29] he's received a great open door
[52:44] a great effectual door is open
[52:48] and many opposed me he says
[52:52] that's what that was what paul's way of
[52:54] knowing is
[52:57] that's how paul knew as he said
[53:00] pablo that god had him
[53:02] where he wanted him
[53:05] because there was plenty of opposition
[53:09] opposition to paul was part of the
[53:11] journey
[53:26] of interpreting
[53:53] there's problems happening
[54:22] we
[54:37] the will of god
[54:39] circumstantially
[54:43] one three
[54:44] uh
[54:47] then came the word of the lord by haggai
[54:49] the prophet saying
[55:28] [Music]
[56:01] [Applause]
[56:02] we say i can't fight against the will of
[56:04] god
[56:08] what do you think i am uh
[56:11] has anyone thought that
[56:15] but now in verse 5
[56:18] god speaks about their behavior
[56:23] and it says that they don't they drink
[56:25] but they're not full and other things
[56:28] they have wages and they pull in a bag
[56:30] of holes
[56:34] it's in verse six but i don't have
[56:36] enough time but what god is telling them
[56:39] since you're so good at interpreting my
[56:41] will she is
[56:55] have you noticed you don't harvest like
[56:56] you used to okay
[57:00] like when you were serving me
[57:03] have you noticed you eat but are never
[57:05] full
[57:06] okay
[57:08] have you noticed you aren't being
[57:09] satisfied
[57:16] go up to the mountain and bring wood and
[57:18] build the house and i will take pleasure
[57:20] in it and will be glorified saith the
[57:21] lord which one is that haggai 1-8
[57:39] it says uh and i will be glorified or
[57:43] forgive me i will take pleasure in it
[57:45] and i will be glorified
[57:49] so god will take pleasure
[57:52] that
[58:09] and god is saying
[58:11] how about doing something for my
[58:13] pleasure
[58:17] how about living for my honor
[58:20] your house is being honored
[58:23] well mine is in ruins and dishonored
[58:26] condos
[58:29] well this temple is in this honor
[58:54] [Music]
[59:00] all right and now we see in the end
[59:10] says then zerubbabel the son of shaltil
[59:12] and joshua the son of josedic the high
[59:14] priest with all the remnant of the
[59:16] people obey the voice of the lord their
[59:19] god and the words of haggai the prophet
[59:41] and to me that's awesome to hear
[59:57] they begin to walk in wisdom
[1:00:02] when they began to fear the lord
[1:00:06] god bless you
[1:00:12] [Applause]
[1:00:23] in the first book of hagai no the
[1:00:25] chapter
[1:00:35] gives a mighty weapon to his people
[1:00:38] that's right brother
[1:00:43] he speaks to them through the prophet
[1:00:48] and speaks to them about time
[1:00:51] he says
[1:00:55] the lord has spoken to you
[1:00:57] thus speak the lord of hosts
[1:01:08] people say the time has not come the
[1:01:09] time that the lord's house should be
[1:01:11] built
[1:01:14] notice how he speaks to them about you
[1:01:17] diablo how the the devil avia usado had
[1:01:20] used
[1:01:36] what they
[1:01:43] [Music]
[1:02:05] is
[1:02:06] this was the idea
[1:02:10] that the devil had
[1:02:11] placed in their minds
[1:02:15] and they were speaking it amongst
[1:02:16] themselves
[1:02:33] they they didn't have to do it
[1:02:36] they believed that it had to be done
[1:02:39] they believed they had to uh build a
[1:02:41] temple
[1:02:43] but the lie of the devil
[1:02:46] and the deceit
[1:03:00] that was the lie of
[1:03:01] [Applause]
[1:03:56] christ
[1:04:01] and especially in the way of bringing
[1:04:02] the words
[1:04:07] if there's a time when there's a spirit
[1:04:09] surrounding
[1:04:38] thinking that nothing happened
[1:04:40] but at this moment
[1:04:45] that's the word of god
[1:04:51] [Music]
[1:05:34] speaks on time
[1:05:54] [Applause]
[1:06:18] [Applause]
[1:06:22] you can run and run through the ages and
[1:06:24] eternity and they're never never never
[1:06:25] been into it
[1:06:28] and that's the way god is
[1:08:07] the devil perverted
[1:08:37] in brazil because
[1:08:39] it's a terrible word
[1:08:42] the little hickey el moreno is a hickey
[1:08:45] brother says hickey in english
[1:08:48] but it's like a a little
[1:09:31] there's a little gap that comes down
[1:09:34] though it breaks over this way
[1:09:36] goes out this way
[1:09:40] god had to do that
[1:09:42] what brother brother puts it here he
[1:09:44] says
[1:10:00] and
[1:10:27] now time is this little loop that loops
[1:10:29] down jesus
[1:10:31] jesus was from eternity to eternity
[1:10:35] but he stepped into the times
[1:10:50] and came through here in order to
[1:10:51] sanctify our put a streak of blood all
[1:10:52] across this place to reach it
[1:10:55] that's all the time is
[1:12:25] [Applause]
[1:12:34] to just kind of break it down
[1:12:37] because many times
[1:12:39] we misunderstand time
[1:12:41] and we waste time
[1:12:43] we don't care about you
[1:12:47] about the opportunities god gives us
[1:13:02] i want you to understand one
[1:13:30] he's talking
[1:13:43] until jesus
[1:13:58] yes
[1:14:12] caused the time to come into action
[1:14:15] not in the form of a father
[1:14:17] but in the form of a study in the form
[1:14:19] of the father of the father
[1:14:21] god is eternal
[1:14:23] foreign
[1:14:36] [Applause]
[1:15:05] you will be eliminated
[1:15:22] but not
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:47] perfect
[1:17:12] and bringing them back into eternity
[1:17:41] things
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:37] and we waste
[1:19:20] where we can be a part of this plan
[1:19:24] or we could just decide when how much or
[1:19:26] how much quanto how much
[1:19:29] god can use us
[1:19:32] throughout that time
[1:20:15] opportunity
[1:20:46] what are you doing with your time
[1:21:26] if you're waiting for the perfect time
[1:21:29] just like them
[1:21:31] it'll never arrive
[1:21:35] it will never arrive
[1:21:37] there will always be an excuse
[1:21:40] there will always
[1:22:22] waiting for
[1:22:35] what are you waiting for
[1:23:03] shall be finished
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:32] to
[1:24:00] the grace of god every day
[1:24:05] we're waiting for somebody uh
[1:24:09] are we waiting for the pastor
[1:24:11] what if the pastor never does it
[1:24:14] are you gonna stay there
[1:24:41] take advantage of what has been given to
[1:24:43] them
[1:24:46] there won't ever be a perfect time
[1:24:48] but at any moment
[1:24:50] there's something we could do
[1:24:53] maybe we won't be able to do it all
[1:24:55] immediately
[1:25:47] [Music]
[1:26:20] even with just
[1:26:48] so you can't do anything
[1:26:50] diablo but you've given a lot to the
[1:26:52] devil
[1:26:55] that's what the devil or god's telling
[1:26:56] you
[1:26:58] so you you say you can't do anything for
[1:26:59] me
[1:27:01] but you've given a lot to the devil
[1:27:16] to worship
[1:27:29] how do you spend so much time on your
[1:27:30] phone
[1:27:35] how do you spend so much time speaking
[1:27:36] about talking about others
[1:27:40] we changed what we were doing
[1:27:43] that we have
[1:28:07] change your mind
[1:28:26] to give god
[1:28:40] that's what we say right
[1:28:43] we look at our condition
[1:28:46] my pockets are empty
[1:28:48] my heart's empty
[1:28:50] my mind is empty i got nothing against
[1:28:53] you that's why i come empty the church
[1:28:55] and i leave empty
[1:28:58] i got nothing to give
[1:29:01] you have nothing to give
