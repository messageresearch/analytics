[27:44] foreign
[27:46] [Music]
[28:48] I lifted up my eyes again and looked and
[28:51] behold the man with the measuring Lion
[28:52] in his hand foreign
[29:11] to see what is the breadth thereof and
[29:14] what is the length thereof yeah
[29:23] and behold the angel that talked with me
[29:25] went forth and another Angel went out to
[29:27] meet him
[29:29] Salem
[29:38] de la multitude De Los Hombres is
[29:44] unto him run speak to this young man
[29:46] saying Jerusalem shall be inhabited as
[29:48] times Without Walls for the multitude of
[29:50] men and cattle what they're in parallel
[30:02] first I say the Lord will be unto her a

[30:07] glory in the midst of her music
[30:14] or in your hands yo
[30:19] okay okay
[30:21] that there's nothing that good that can

[30:31] have pity on me Lord

[30:39] is
[30:43] don't allow it for me to speak uh
[30:45] something wrong okay
[30:50] but help so that what I speak can be a
[30:53] verification to your people
[30:56] and at the end of it
[30:59] all glory and honor be to you
[31:03] I asked this in the name of Jesus Christ
[31:17] we're focused
[31:19] man
[31:22] the last days he chose me
[31:26] that's the title we placed this morning
[31:32] and our pastors
[31:35] this morning
[31:39] when we think about a measuring line
[31:44] is
[31:47] something that we automatically think is
[31:55] it's something to Mark a certain place
[32:06] um it's a place it's something that you
[32:08] used to Mark a place
[32:11] to Mark the certain perimeters
[32:16] it's a line of division
[32:20] when we think of a measuring life
[32:26] thinking about a sort of ruler where you
[32:28] measures
[32:35] focusing on on measuring a certain
[32:37] territory
[32:42] the certain property
[32:50] in my house
[32:53] I have a neighbor
[32:55] that he has an RV is crb and his RV is
[33:00] very big
[33:01] is
[33:07] where you have all the Commodities of a
[33:09] home on Wheels
[33:19] it on the side that's really close to my
[33:21] house he
[33:24] the other day I told my wife
[33:29] I told him hey I think we need to go to
[33:31] the city
[33:34] is
[33:36] to ask them where in fact our our
[33:40] property line is
[33:44] because I feel like the neighbor is
[33:46] getting too close to my side or the
[33:48] property
[33:49] so a measuring line
[33:52] for Allah
[34:27] I
[34:32] would like to know
[34:35] where the limits lie to my property
[34:39] yes
[34:43] so when we think of a measuring line
[34:46] I began to think
[34:53] when they left
[34:55] um to to the to land The Babylon as
[34:57] captives
[34:59] foreign
[35:09] for many years they had lived there
[35:26] they went on to the to be captured to
[35:29] the middle Persians
[35:38] the time came for them where they had
[35:41] that hunger to to return
[35:42] foreign
[36:19] foreign
[36:32] limits
[36:43] because sometimes we think
[36:48] about limitations
[36:52] we're talking about separations
[37:00] we have no control over
[37:06] search
[37:09] but searching through Google's
[37:11] dictionary
[37:16] it tells us that the word limits means
[37:18] is
[37:31] a defined line that separates
[37:34] the perimeters between two entities yes
[37:51] it doesn't belong to me
[37:57] what is ours
[38:07] they could never conquer what God had
[38:10] given them
[38:15] what is in fact what belongs to me and
[38:18] when you don't know what
[38:20] your perimeters
[38:27] what belongs to me is there foreign
[39:46] [Applause]
[39:47] says
[39:57] that's the saddest side I've ever seen
[40:00] Hombres que foreign
[40:40] that would like to Spring forth
[40:44] amen
[40:46] I see a group of people
[40:51] that because they don't know what
[40:53] belongs to them
[40:55] though
[41:00] you're living as strangers as foreigners
[41:09] [Music]
[41:42] an American
[41:57] he can still feel like a foreigner
[42:17] doesn't know if they're a baby
[42:20] is
[42:32] the Earth
[42:44] from the world or from church
[42:47] that's the problem with not knowing
[42:50] don't understand
[42:51] where are limits lie out right amen
[42:56] ities
[42:58] let me tell you something
[43:00] God has no limits
[43:02] but I need limits
[43:07] God has no limits
[43:10] everything in the universe pertains to
[43:12] God but I all sometimes need limitations
[43:28] [Music]
[43:34] because it will be a line of judgment
[43:36] then leave me this limits right
[43:41] right when I need
[43:46] to know what belongs
[43:48] we have no business outside of the word
[43:52] these are my prayers
[44:00] that is my standards
[44:08] Oh Glory
[44:10] thank you
[44:13] thank you
[44:15] we live in a world
[44:18] where we all want to be the same
[44:23] well we want to be like the rest of the
[44:25] people
[44:27] Without Limits with our restrictions
[44:34] we don't want them to regulate us
[44:43] the bride has no rights
[44:46] [Music]
[44:49] is the one that was given by God yes and
[44:53] that is the word
[45:00] that is you're right
[45:09] no one can take that from you
[45:20] they don't know the power
[45:25] because they're living under their own
[45:27] privileges
[45:30] privileges that you could have
[45:34] but you don't know
[45:43] I see the urgency of God
[45:47] latitude
[45:56] of what belongs to the people of Israel
[46:02] question
[46:05] I believe that this prophecy in its
[46:08] fullness
[46:10] but I believe that's going to be
[46:12] fulfilled in its fullness
[46:15] we're the people of Israel
[46:18] was that all that was for them
[46:32] our thoughts
[46:37] and that that brings me to think
[46:40] importante how important is
[46:44] that you live
[46:46] parameters under the perimeter's goddess
[46:49] place for you
[46:53] God is a God
[46:56] killings fee that he and himself
[47:00] that he he cuts
[47:04] he has a measure
[47:06] where he cuts
[47:10] did you know that God
[47:12] this is
[47:13] before the foundation of the world
[47:16] when he was going to choose a bride
[47:18] Elementary
[47:24] that many youth that are going to be
[47:26] married soon
[47:27] and when someone's going to be married
[47:30] the first thing that they do
[47:33] first they're engaged
[47:36] but in the process
[47:40] [Music]
[47:43] of the Bride of arranging her dress the
[47:48] primary things of her dress
[47:50] she takes a fabric
[47:54] and she begins to design it
[47:57] she begins to separate
[48:00] now the fabric is
[48:03] the fabric is one
[48:06] Surplus
[48:35] it's God separated
[48:52] let's call it what this is
[48:59] whatever kind of fabric
[49:03] and she's got a pattern
[49:08] and
[49:09] she looks over this big house
[49:16] Where She lays his patterns
[49:26] that draws lies
[49:35] it's sanctified
[49:37] foreign
[50:33] without perimeters
[50:43] from here on now
[50:47] what will be yours
[50:53] are you following me this morning
[51:00] there are two things that I begin to see
[51:05] number one
[51:09] and
[51:12] what we just read in the scriptures of
[51:15] Zechariah
[51:18] I see two purposes behind those
[51:21] scriptures the first is
[51:24] to draw a line
[51:27] that separates
[51:31] of what belongs to us
[51:35] we are living in the end time
[51:38] and you shouldn't be like The World
[51:42] God wants to draw a line of differences
[51:55] because God is drawing a lot
[51:59] for you not to be like the rest
[52:29] for the foundation of the world
[52:34] I see a line
[52:40] that separates what he's chosen
[52:47] Bros we are the property of God
[52:50] is
[52:53] the pride of Jesus Christ then you were
[52:56] bought
[52:57] by the price
[53:05] as a son or daughter of God
[53:10] and we could just understand that this
[53:13] morning
[53:19] okay
[53:21] the second point that I want to express
[53:28] God promised a man
[53:31] this is
[53:37] many times or many years previous to
[53:40] what was occurring in the book of
[53:41] Zechariah
[53:43] where the people of Israel are returning
[53:46] back to their land
[53:48] and where God wants to once again
[53:52] work with them
[53:57] but many many years
[54:03] God had made a promise to a man named
[54:05] Abraham
[54:07] said his descendancy
[54:15] that land
[54:20] look Brothers
[54:23] the second point
[54:26] I see God
[54:28] that he's returning
[54:31] to his people
[54:34] but he's doing something very special
[54:39] he's claiming once again
[54:42] what he gave them
[54:47] and what to that people
[54:50] what belonged to them
[54:55] because if God gave you something
[54:57] brother sister it is yours
[55:02] God is returning
[55:05] it's claiming once again restating
[55:09] what is theirs
[55:18] brother Bernie preached a message called
[55:20] the period the the reclaiming period is
[55:33] he died two thousand years ago for us
[55:40] he died
[55:47] [Music]
[55:59] he says in the message
[56:02] the perfect faith
[56:05] I love what he says here
[56:11] when I was nothing
[56:19] says
[56:21] amen
[56:24] but I'm in his hands now
[56:27] I want to be a prisoner of Jesus
[56:31] Christ
[56:40] and then the chains of love I want to be
[56:42] in his chains
[56:47] his reps of lover are subject me and
[56:50] give me peace
[56:56] foreign
[57:44] that I'm not what I used to be
[57:47] right
[57:48] that's me Church
[57:51] perhaps I haven't gone to uh to obtain
[57:54] what I was
[57:56] maybe the world is doing it and I want
[58:00] to go to those times
[58:11] more to conquer
[58:18] foreign
[58:55] and
[59:09] they went to build their own homes
[1:00:07] and
[1:00:10] his word is one everything
[1:00:16] foreign
[1:00:23] but God has to go and tell them
[1:00:26] you guys are mine
[1:00:28] you are my property I gave you this land
[1:00:31] and you belong to me
[1:00:38] brother Branham says
[1:00:47] and the message is the breach between
[1:00:49] the church ages and the Seven Seals
[1:00:52] relation
[1:00:56] to Redemption
[1:00:59] of all creation
[1:01:01] is in his hand
[1:01:08] he has now come to claim it all
[1:01:11] all of the human race
[1:01:15] not to claim it back to the angels
[1:01:21] he's handed back to the human
[1:01:25] there's a great difference brothers
[1:01:29] look at what's happening in the people
[1:01:31] of Israel I have to go back so I can
[1:01:34] understand myself
[1:01:38] God is not for God but for his children
[1:01:42] he's claiming that for his children
[1:01:50] God is is the is the owner of the
[1:01:52] universe
[1:01:55] God is claiming once again the rights of
[1:01:57] his children
[1:01:59] and look at what brother Brown continues
[1:02:01] to say
[1:02:04] he's climbing it back
[1:02:07] which it was given for
[1:02:18] the trees
[1:02:21] everything else
[1:02:25] oh oh my brother Branham says
[1:02:30] that paid the price
[1:02:34] that I couldn't pay
[1:02:40] amen
[1:02:44] salvation
[1:02:52] but it doesn't stop there
[1:02:55] don't know the mascara I don't just want
[1:02:59] to go to heaven and say I was saved
[1:03:04] everything that God
[1:03:08] and I'm not talking about riches or
[1:03:10] financial groups
[1:03:13] I'm talking about the spiritual things
[1:03:18] that the bride can have
[1:03:21] games
[1:03:33] because he gave it to me
[1:03:41] sometimes on so many dumb things
[1:03:51] we put everything in one place and it
[1:03:54] will bring us nothing
[1:03:58] we're trying to claim things
[1:04:09] I'd rather
[1:04:11] the promises of God
[1:04:13] spiritual things that give me peace
[1:04:19] like the things of this world
[1:04:24] I told my wife
[1:04:26] I've asked the work to pay for it
[1:04:33] stressed out
[1:04:41] [Applause]
[1:04:44] a life
[1:04:47] [Applause]
[1:04:50] you're not always it
[1:04:52] with a sour face
[1:04:54] it's because I have to pay the bills
[1:04:59] it's the stress of the world
[1:05:03] that is Drawing the Line
[1:05:05] you're worrying about other things about
[1:05:09] your home
[1:05:13] that's why you live miserably
[1:05:16] God telling his people that's why you're
[1:05:19] not happy
[1:05:21] it's time to claim
[1:05:24] spiritual things where they don't pass
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:29] sometimes
[1:05:32] and we feel just great I I spent so much
[1:05:38] right
[1:05:42] if we
[1:05:43] are Cancun I went to Cancun Brothers
[1:05:47] that's good go
[1:05:51] Al
[1:05:51] it's your right
[1:05:55] I want to claim things that belong to me
[1:05:57] spiritually speaking
[1:06:06] now he comes to claim his Redemptive
[1:06:08] rights
[1:06:10] the bride has right God chose us
[1:06:18] and we have certain rights
[1:06:23] brother random says
[1:06:26] claiming them for who is
[1:06:30] claiming them for who Hermanos
[1:06:36] he wasn't he wasn't saying
[1:06:39] this is where I'm going to draw the line
[1:06:41] the parameter the area
[1:06:45] Brothers
[1:07:39] I don't know why I said it but I said
[1:07:42] it's going to be for someone
[1:07:47] claiming them for what
[1:07:49] nobody has to see me smoke not for
[1:07:52] himself
[1:07:56] for us
[1:08:00] God draws a line
[1:08:03] he begins to measure with the line with
[1:08:06] the measurements because God says
[1:08:09] because this belongs to you I want to
[1:08:13] give it to you
[1:08:23] unbelievers in what God has given us
[1:08:28] is it true that sometimes we can't claim
[1:08:31] what God that God loves us and that he
[1:08:34] wants to give us things
[1:08:36] that's not for me it's maybe for the
[1:08:39] pastor but not for me Perfection he's
[1:08:41] going to get
[1:08:43] just help let him remember me when he
[1:08:45] gets there
[1:08:47] if you're a Son of God God chose you
[1:08:51] he cut out the pattern the design for
[1:08:54] you
[1:08:56] you are a part of that dress
[1:08:59] yes
[1:09:07] because I live in myself
[1:09:11] foreign
[1:09:46] says
[1:10:02] [Music]
[1:10:05] so sometimes
[1:10:07] you have to draw and make a separation
[1:10:15] must be separated
[1:10:18] thank you Lord amen
[1:10:25] he is one of ours
[1:10:28] is
[1:10:29] our Kinfolk
[1:10:33] okay
[1:10:34] oh my brother
[1:10:36] he's my brother
[1:10:42] with me we're on the same battle
[1:10:50] he is my savior
[1:10:53] he's my God is
[1:10:56] my kids men Redeemer he's all for
[1:11:00] without him

[1:11:08] teen without him

[1:11:15] we live a life Without Limits a life
[1:11:19] without limits
[1:11:25] then I wouldn't be here
[1:11:28] foreign
[1:12:19] why am I doing it
[1:12:24] it's necessary that he comes at an angel
[1:12:27] as an angel came
[1:12:31] and he said it's necessary
[1:12:34] that I look to Jerusalem the house of
[1:12:38] God
[1:12:41] the bread of God where God wants to to
[1:12:44] live
[1:12:45] God wants to live in US
[1:12:47] [Music]
[1:12:52] that is one reason why he puts
[1:12:54] perimeters
[1:12:55] because he's so anxious to have an
[1:12:58] encounter with us
[1:13:00] and for us to be able to obtain

[1:26:39] what part of the experience he had when
[1:26:43] he looked at a pastor
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:53] or other animals
[1:26:58] [Music]

[1:27:47] inside the home
[1:27:50] to its limits to the borders where the
[1:27:54] pastor knows
[1:27:55] where it can be taken care of
[1:27:58] done and this morning
[1:28:00] can we ask our father
[1:28:04] I don't know what the Holy Spirit wants

[1:31:53] [Music]
[1:31:55] I want to give some uh updates updates
[1:31:58] let's stay uh
[1:32:12] congratulations our brother Felix
[1:32:18] it's our brother Andrea
[1:32:23] she'll be here soon with us if God
[1:32:25] allows us
[1:32:39] they'll be presented to church
[1:32:41] [Music]
[1:32:45] but the property
[1:32:51] and the building is
[1:33:00] there have been some things happening
[1:33:02] Ocho
[1:33:17] Timberline
[1:33:22] property art church
[1:33:30] we have tried to build uh is
[1:33:34] no there's always been things in the way
[1:33:38] uh
[1:33:47] or in the last stages
[1:33:50] and there's been a problem
[1:33:54] and the problems with our neighbors
[1:33:56] you remember George yes George
[1:34:01] um and see
[1:34:23] than George has
[1:34:50] it's a requirement of the city for that
[1:34:53] to be signed up
[1:34:58] um
[1:35:14] [Music]
[1:35:26] the city may give us permission to start
[1:35:29] building on the property I stay
[1:35:31] um
[1:35:39] the engineers
[1:35:42] that we should help seek seek help from
[1:35:45] a lawyers
[1:35:54] at the end when you invert so much money
[1:35:56] uh
[1:36:03] more than seven thousand dollars have
[1:36:05] gone into this is
[1:36:11] 150 000.
[1:36:16] it's not just anything
[1:36:20] the work that the brothers
[1:36:30] to me it's not just anything
[1:36:33] for me it hurts to hear something like
[1:36:36] that
[1:36:38] so we're not closed
[1:36:45] by another one
[1:36:48] we know we need a church
[1:36:51] and God will provide it
[1:37:55] and the story told me I possibly that
[1:37:58] there's a possibility responsibility
[1:38:04] he says that what we're doing is
[1:38:19] already been used
[1:38:21] that water already passes through there
[1:38:23] they say entonces
[1:38:30] for so many years
[1:38:45] then you can ask the judge is
[1:38:54] is
[1:39:30] uh
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:40:00] a
[1:40:31] um system
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:42:21] and we're just you
[1:42:48] that idea
[1:43:07] eventually we'll have our church
[1:43:12] if you have any questions just let me
[1:43:15] know
[1:43:16] um
[1:43:27] [Music]
[1:43:40] um
[1:43:42] the second point is
[1:43:55] we found a place that could work
[1:44:01] there's many places that just don't work
[1:44:03] as a church
[1:44:05] it's very different to find a commercial
[1:44:07] place
[1:44:10] where we can use as a church is the
[1:44:13] requirements
[1:44:15] the requirements
[1:44:21] because we're not a type of church that
[1:44:23] just comes on Sundays and then go home
[1:44:27] there are people who make their Church
[1:44:36] our church is different
[1:44:41] the requirements
[1:44:59] so our requirements are different
[1:45:03] so we can't just go to any place
[1:45:06] and it's very expensive right now
[1:45:12] especially right now
[1:45:17] and those is
[1:45:19] um
[1:45:21] place that we found looked really nice
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:29] but the city of Fort Collins
[1:45:38] to that place is
[1:46:06] our contract ends this year
[1:46:10] what are you telling us are you guys
[1:46:12] going to
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:14] renewable
[1:46:16] because they want to put someone here
[1:46:21] talk to the owner
[1:46:25] about everything
[1:46:31] I believe we're all worried
[1:46:34] of the necessities
[1:47:01] [Music]
[1:47:14] foreign
[1:47:42] [Music]
[1:48:14] principal
[1:48:38] is
[1:48:44] there's a warehouse here that they're
[1:48:46] renting out
[1:48:47] [Music]
[1:48:49] I say maybe that's an option
[1:48:52] um
[1:49:03] every Sunday for fellowships and food
[1:49:06] that's the ideas that I have right now
[1:49:09] Anton says
[1:49:10] so I want to let you know
[1:49:13] how things are right now
[1:49:17] if you have any idea or questions
[1:49:27] nothing's completely finalized
[1:49:30] and some changes can be made
[1:49:33] so if you have a better idea let us know
[1:49:37] things are right now
[1:49:42] I've always said this is
[1:49:46] the church is not the building
[1:49:49] the church is the people
[1:49:52] and as long as the people are well
[1:49:55] we'll be fine
[1:49:58] God will give us our building at this
[1:50:01] time
[1:50:05] there's someone who wants a building
[1:50:10] I've been searching places
[1:50:14] I want to go visit many places
[1:50:19] it's not as easy as you may think
[1:50:23] um
