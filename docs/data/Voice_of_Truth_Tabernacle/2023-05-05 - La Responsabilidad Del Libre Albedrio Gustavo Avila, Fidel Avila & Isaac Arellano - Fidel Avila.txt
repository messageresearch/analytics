Diaz [Music] it says like this they say I see now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou has despised me and has taken the the wife of Uriah the hittai to be thy wife evil against thee out of thine own house and I will take the wise before thine eyes and I will give them unto thy neighbor and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this son is [Music] big one thou has given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blasphemy the child also that is Born Into thee shall surely die foreign thank you and we ask of all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God bless you once again it's truly privileged and honor to be amongst the Saints the title of our time of this preaching this morning the responsibility of Free Will responsibilities and I'm going to read one more scripture Joshua chapter 24. we give thanks unto our pastor for entrusting Us in this evening to speak to his beautiful people are you happy to be here key are you here estaki that's good yes and the word of God says like this now therefore fear the lord and serve him in the sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father serve on the other side of the flood and then and in Egypt and Survey the Lord is unto you to serve the Lord to you this day choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood go ahead Vice Cielos dioses Padres or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwelt but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord and amen amen now if we notice there it says choose you this day brother Branham says that God allowed man God has allowed a law of choosing and a free moral agency and God has left the law of Free Will here in this earth a beloved Prophet also says that when he did that he left free will celebrate man equal unto God El is a minor God yes foreign Nathaniel's telling them the consequences of that one choice he tells them that the sword shall never depart from thine house and then in verse 11 it says I will rise up in an evil against thee out of thine own house and as you continue reading the story of David there we know that amnon and his sister that what happened there where the his brother slept with his sister amen you can see verse 11 there being fulfilled in you say in the verse 11 yes and I will take thy wives before Thine Eyes again it's not me it's what the word is saying exactly and he says and give them unto Thy Neighbor this is thank you to sleeping with the 10 concubines in which King David Left Behind when he fled Las cuales again the consequences of a choice again we go back to the title the responsibility of Free Will responsibility and thanks be regards he had a perfect plan set up already for each and every one of us and you knew all the decisions that we were going to make good or bad yes and again he had to leave this order or this this love of Free Will and then to freely choose to pick what you want to do you're truly not knowing god in his fullness knowing those attributes that he's had inside of him they had to be proven one way or another and that's why he left the law of choosing pores because again we would be like the angels Los Angeles because then we would we wouldn't be able to sing those songs that we sing now my provider knowing everything that was gonna happen in everything perfectly planned out for us we know if we choose God it was never us choosing God truly it's got a part of God in us choosing him again God wants us to have an education in his life to learn later on because we know later on ruling he says now we're all born a free moral agent to make any decision that we each wish too God just does that because he must put every man on the same basis or he put the wrong or he put the wrong man he put the first man on the wrong basis he says see we're just exactly tonight like Adam and Eve say it again when he chose to sleep gracias well thanks be to God that God uses the mistakes of man perogacious to make something great out of that the prophet says life and death we can make our own choice it's up to you to make it that's the way Adam did it is you see they made the wrong choice and now by the whole Human by the whole race of human race under death the penalty of death and then God came down in the former man taking the death and paid the penalty of death that is subjected that desire to be free could be free foreign just pull us out through something and say I'll save you whether you have whether you want to be saved or not then he put Adam and Eve on the wrong basis you see but but each one of us has to choose this day between death and life again we go back to the Free Will and God cannot be a a just God if he made man fall permit and then later on try to come and be a redeemer he fornicated we know that foreign is don't be surprised later on of the consequences again we always ask ourselves why did this happen again we can't understand why because that we have a God that not only is he our judge but he also is our father the religious World paints us paints him as just simply a judge but this message shows us that not only is he a judge knows he's also a father I guess he corrects his son when he makes a mistake he corrects his daughter when they make a mistake but also being a father he also provides a way back he provides them the ways back to him with open arms again [Music] knowing all the decisions we will make one day foreign we'll choose something that we think is okay but we truly don't look at the greater picture and see it later on the consequences what that may happen again the people of Israel didn't have to go through all the chaos when Absalom came into Power let's kick David out we don't have to suffer we don't have to go through hardships because the only thing remember that we're taking from this Earth is the character right and God allows all these bad things you know how to forgive someone maybe never desert forgiveness someone that never deserved someone that never deserves an opportunity but that's why God allows all this foreign indigo [Applause] Manos God bless you Brothers uh the Holy Spirit Works brother Gustavo was pretty much reading my notes if you could follow me the second Samuel chapter 12. amen hope you're feeling at home seem a little serious this evening we've come to learn from the word of God Amen to come with expectation a okay and David's and David's anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to Nathan as the Lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die yes 13. it is and David said unto Nathan I have sinned against the Lord and Nathan said unto David the Lord also has put away thy sin Thou shalt not die and one last scripture in the Book of Psalms chapter 51 verse 14. I'll be reading it in English and it says deliver me from blood guiltiness deliver me from blood guiltiness oh God thou God of my salvation salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousnessia now I want to focus here on this word we're still talking about David Bathsheba and Uriah um but this is more when David is repenting now um You can already understand it by just the word right it's the fact or state of being guilty of murder or Bloodshed is Lord Jesus Christ sovereign um from a sharing his death we are all guilt we can all be guilty I'm taking it slow so we understand both things David who is guilty of uriah's blood David and we can also be guilty of Jesus Christ I just want the youth to understand this also those who rejects the spies neglects the claims of the Lord [Music] those who refuse to bow to Jesus they're actually mocking Jesus they scorched him and put him to death rights and speaking against his gospel into writing his servants and denying his deity and then refusing to believe in him of crucifying the Lord Of Glory because if the Way I Live Now I was living back then [Music] my life would prove me me Vida that I would crucify Jesus that's personal to me we have committed the action of crucifying him but the blood cometh upon to our condemnation guys unless by faith it comes upon us to our acceptance and forgiveness so the blood can do two things I'm going very slow for you brother either the blood of Jesus will fall on you and cleanse your hearts and the blood of Uriah was condemning David he had blood guiltiness on him now uh something that can just stand out all right I'll go saliente about the story that's the Historia is that we can stop while we're ahead okay and bad things happen to good people um and there's consequences to our actions as our brother was saying consequences now first David had two opportunities if you didn't know David was ahead of his sinus or it could have been ahead he had two opportunities when he saw this woman showering when he was on the rooftop the first way he could have been ahead um he should have been on the battlefield not walking on the rooftops but anyways once he saw that woman he could have left but he didn't he asked about her and he found out she was married he said and he asked to bring her but his mind was already made up and on what he wanted that's why it was hard for him to leave foreign um what is it 27 12. says a prudent man for seeth the evil and heideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished this is we should be prudence and seeing the dangerous and making certain choices decision if we don't know we'll find ourselves paying the penalty later there's always a consequence whether it be sooner it can be a short term or a long term and now Uriah as a good person and don't say I admire you I wish my brother Eric didn't speak about Uriah as much because I wanted to speak about him but Uriah lost his life when having service brother we're in spiritual warfare spiritual when God's Army is here and the devil is going to catch us as an easy prey out there you know we have to be with the army with the yeah with the sheep together the flock defends itself and Uriah was saying that he could not go with his wife he could not enjoy what the soldiers his brothers could not enjoy he said if these servants can't and I can't either because that was his own wife you know that makes me know that he saw her more than a wife perhaps a daughter of God has a sister you know to be faithful to his post of Duty and now there's consequences to our actions all right consequences the results of David's adultery result had multiple consequences although he tried to prevent them anyone try to prevent you shouldn't feel that that can't happen peligro another reason why I believe this happened Revelation 3 2 says apocalypse is watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found that it works perfect before God now for David to be relaxing as my brother said um Eric he said David was bloodthirsty mind emotions and actions but David's laziness and rooting this out trans lapa into a laziness of calling and purpose our brother Eric was talking about distractions he got distracted by Fame and success we were speaking with brother Fidel maybe he got used to winning maybe you got used to coming to church and having Victory all the time you know you got used to the good things but that shouldn't be we don't know David was a warrior to establish and lead a God-fearing Nation for like the most of us must have grown tired how many get tired of church now eventually all of David's decisions were done poorly foreign except that you have a sinful nature in accept accepted acceptable except that you have a simple question while on Earth you will be sinful and so the Lord the Rapture comes but guard your hearts and don't come into that routine if I can leave you with this verse it's Romans 8 28 says we know that all things work together for good to them that love God now the Royal bloodline kept coming through Solomon it didn't matter what David's consequences were yes uh his child died you know the same thing continued happening in his life adultery David and all things work for good doesn't matter how vile how evil David wanted to kill the man that took the little sheep in the parable but Nathan responds to him with Grace you shall not die what if somebody told you that yes can you be in the steps of David tonight when you would desire someone's death and they're talking about you yet they forgive you it's tremendous God bless you yeah Hermanos Superstore foreign [Music] how many Davids are here I don't hear too many Davids I hear a lot of Davis when they say that David Cook but when they say that David failed then no one says [Music] where none of us are exempt to sinus here this verse it says in seconds this is when it came to pass after Europeans at the times when kings go forth to battle estamos hablando we're talking about David and look the scripture says that it was during the time that the Kings go to bed now this gives to me is that there's a Time [Music] it wasn't the correct time and there's sometimes that we also we're thinking that it's time foreign and we hear it nothing moves you because you have cold it's cold because you haven't guarded yourself because you've made yourself into a routine you lost your focus routine the focus is love [Music] so we lose our Focus for why we do things yeah we come to church there we lose our focus and we no longer know why we come you will come to see a good preaching I want to see God on the scene yeah I got so tired I'm just playing church because we can play Church all the time wanna see God honestly God on the scene let the sick be healed because the gospel that is the gospel we die for amen and there David was he was kept unguarded he let his guard down they say yes that David got up from his bed and went walked on the roof of the Royal House and he began to take a little stroll when he had to be on the front lines in battle and many times we here Brothers we have to be in the front lines of the battle and we send their brother to the front instead let the brothers and sisters and we're there at home I didn't feel like coming to church today nothing's gonna happen the devil is like humidity by little by little he starts working and he's going to begin to call you David was he was relaxed in his bed and Uriah tells him my Lord how do you think Meanwhile my brothers are in a bottle I don't know if that doesn't happen well their brothers are pushing us and many of us are sleeping we're not waiting on anything our Pastor said on Friday he said sometimes we think nothing is happening let me tell you something tonight if something is happening or you're gonna leave worse amen sorry you know Psalm 51 says that David says that return to me the joy of my salvation and I was thinking I see that David [Music] even though what had happened he was already he was dragging something priorities because you're not going to lose the joy of yourself not over a sin remember one thing would lead you to another yeah it'll lead you to another the message considering our path perhaps you had a real experience in your heart this is for me Brothers and your heart burned after having received the Holy Spirit in your life there David was who knows a couple verses he fought against the Giant all right we begin to hear the gospel we begin to hear over Jesus who is with his hands that loves us with all of his hearts and it comes to the point that you lose your focus it comes to the point of your house but when you lose when you don't no longer dedicate we no longer dedicate when you don't hear her she doesn't hear you yeah you guys don't hear one of them you begin to fall on the routine daily a daily routine and you lose at the essence of it because we get into a routine and that's how we are in church wow [Music] he said he says but one way or another you got away from him the ones that get away are us he never sets himself apart from us it doesn't matter it doesn't it doesn't matter that he'd fallen so much maybe he felt so bad I don't know if you sin but I have but when you say yeah something's not right within me I failed you said my loved ones there is something in your heart yeah he told him that's what that's what um but within yourself you can say Lord or you'll say Lord forgive me I don't deserve yourself I think I don't deserve your mercies oh Lord forgive me once more maybe you didn't dedicate the adequate amount of time to be in communication with your lord maybe you dedicated more time to Facebook or Instagram let me tell you there's something that feels you more than that and it's the word of God when you grab it you take it and you put it inside of your heart and he begins to work in your life but sometimes we get into a stage of routine and it's a very stubborn routine or stage he says that the doctor discovered in my lungs I had two blacks Pumas I asked him do you smoke he said oh this is he said oh yeah I do smoke and I told him why don't you stop smoking why don't you but it's the same thing with the Devil it's the same thing in the spirit we're seeing that that's gonna kill us that it's separation and David okay [Music] and he seen that he was insane all right closing with this Fresno I shared this in Fresno hello hate versus love forgive me Brothers but this is what God's place in my heart this is what God has given me when I hear the prophet that he says that the messenger them his message are won me have I truly lost that love Lord forgive me I tell him have I lost the love for your children oh brother and I say Lord don't allow for that to get into my heart sometimes I get tired I get tired I don't know if you get tired I may not end our reading this here Brothers when I get tired sometimes Brothers do you get tired as well I think you do yeah but sometimes I get tired I can't stay at home if I don't if I don't come to service on the day of service I I feel bad us for something greater or more [Music] do you stand Brothers you know youth look like don't think that I've grown tired of you God knows that I love you but that is a man and a human this body gets tired laughs [Music] my focus Brothers I am happy I have everything nothing because we like nothing he has been so good look at my family because my children because thank you God because you provide
