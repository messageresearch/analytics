[31:54] amen amen amen God bless
[31:58] you you can open your Bibles with
[32:02] me to Second
[32:05] Corinthians chapter
[32:08] 12 a privilege to be in God's
[32:12] house and it's a privilege to come and
[32:15] worship our
[32:17] creator how many love him this morning
[32:22] amen as long as he is here that's what
[32:25] matters that's all that
[32:31] matters 2 Corinthians 12 verse
[32:35] 2 reads in the following
[32:40] way 2 Corinthians
[32:55] 122 I knew a man in Christ above 14
[32:58] years ago whether in the body I cannot
[33:00] tell or whether out of the body I cannot
[33:02] tell God knoweth such and one caught up
[33:05] to the third
[33:10] heaven and I knew such a man whether in
[33:13] the body or out of the body I cannot
[33:15] tell God
[33:23] knoweth how that he was caught up into
[33:26] Paradise and heard unspeakable Words
[33:28] which is not lawful for a man to
[33:37] utter of such in one will I Glory yet of
[33:41] myself I will not Glory but in my
[33:44] infirmities let us pray Lord Jesus
[33:48] Christ we are thankful once
[33:51] again to come into your
[33:55] presence with the correct
[33:58] atmosphere the correct
[34:00] attitude correct desire
[34:04] Lord that's the way we come close to
[34:07] you not thinking we know everything no
[34:11] sir but
[34:14] humble needing you to teach
[34:17] us Lord we put ourselves in
[34:21] your every heart every
[34:24] mind looking at you in this morning
[34:28] we ask that you help
[34:29] us in the precious name of the Lord
[34:31] Jesus Christ amen amen may be
[34:36] seated we have been speaking about the
[34:40] coming of the
[34:42] Lord PR time that I
[34:46] preached I preached about this is not it
[34:50] repeat this is not
[34:54] it so I want to follow up with that
[34:56] thought
[35:02] this morning the Lord has put in my
[35:04] heart to speak about the other side
[35:07] repeat the other
[35:09] side where are we headed to the other
[35:13] side this world is not our
[35:19] home this is not what we're
[35:23] expecting I believe one of the
[35:25] reasons
[35:28] that we come to
[35:29] church it's to come in the
[35:35] atmosphere where the other side is more
[35:37] real to
[35:40] us sometimes this side of
[35:43] Eternity seems too
[35:47] real but let me tell you on the other
[35:50] side this is not
[35:52] it there's another
[35:55] side I believe there is proof that
[35:58] there's another
[36:00] side to begin the holy
[36:03] spirit is the
[36:06] evidence for the
[36:09] believer that there's another
[36:13] world there's another
[36:19] land the queen
[36:25] of
[36:32] there's not a person in the world that
[36:34] ever come from behind the current into
[36:36] this light that we live in called
[36:45] life but what wonders where he goes when
[36:48] he goes beyond
[36:51] here have you ever wondered ask
[36:55] yourself what Happ happens when we leave
[36:57] this
[36:58] earth sooner or
[37:00] later one way or
[37:02] another we will leave this
[37:05] earth whether through
[37:09] death whether the transformation of our
[37:13] bodies whether however God
[37:19] decides but we will leave this worldless
[37:24] atmosphere and I'm going put it this way
[37:26] these
[37:30] Dimensions be speaking about Dimensions
[37:33] also because we want to see where
[37:35] someone goes when they pass
[37:37] away we want to see that
[37:40] Dimension brother brandham
[37:46] says but what wonders where he goes when
[37:49] he goes beyond
[37:55] here it's just the Instinct in a man to
[37:57] do
[38:00] that we all
[38:06] seek we want to know what's beyond the
[38:11] curtain we're searching for
[38:13] that sooner or
[38:16] later at some time in our
[38:19] lives we are
[38:23] conscious one day we will leave this
[38:25] earth
[38:28] the devil wants to keep us
[38:30] entertained in this
[38:33] life so that we don't think on the one
[38:35] that's
[38:36] coming but times
[38:39] come it could have been when we were on
[38:42] our death
[38:46] bed it could have been when someone else
[38:48] passed
[38:50] away but many times I
[38:54] believe it happens when we have a tough
[38:58] great
[39:00] loss when we have a tough
[39:03] loss we ask ourselves is this
[39:08] everything what happens after
[39:11] this when there's a great
[39:14] loss I don't know if this happens to
[39:19] you you begin to not want to be
[39:23] here I don't know if that's happened to
[39:25] any of you
[39:28] but when you don't find
[39:32] flavor when you used to think that would
[39:34] be the greatest
[39:36] here all of a sudden you lose
[39:40] it all of a sudden it's outside of your
[39:45] reach there's a feeling that drowns
[39:49] you and tells you I don't want to be
[39:52] here anymore what's the point of being
[39:55] here
[39:57] Brothers when you've lost
[40:02] everything let's put it like this when
[40:04] you've lost the greatest thing in your
[40:06] life has someone lost a son a daughter
[40:10] father a
[40:12] mother a great loved
[40:14] person very loved by them brother
[40:19] Brom when he lost his
[40:21] daughter and his
[40:23] wife he didn't want to be here
[40:27] said Lord take me
[40:29] also what's the purpose of being
[40:34] here and this not only happens when we
[40:36] lose a loved
[40:42] one but this also happens when we lose
[40:45] hope in this
[40:48] Earth as it happen to you see your life
[40:50] around
[40:54] you see your circumstance
[40:58] and you say is this
[41:04] everything I have not another desire to
[41:06] be in this place come on
[41:09] Church sooner or
[41:11] later I believe God's
[41:14] son needs to come to the
[41:17] point where the things of this
[41:20] world precious to
[41:22] him they have no
[41:25] value
[41:26] I believe God tests his
[41:29] children in such a way where they're
[41:31] willing to let go of
[41:33] everything just like he did with
[41:36] AB your family your
[41:40] Homeland then he said leave your son
[41:43] ishma and then he
[41:45] tells give me your son
[41:48] Isaac God wanted to make
[41:53] sure loved the God's business more than
[41:56] the things of this
[41:58] Earth and God takes us to a place in our
[42:04] lives of this world have no
[42:10] value may God take us to that
[42:14] place we fight for temporary
[42:18] things we fight we get
[42:22] angry we effort ourselves for things
[42:25] that aren't going to
[42:27] When God
[42:30] says when we should fix our
[42:33] sides on the things from up
[42:38] above sooner later if you're a Son of
[42:44] God you want to see the other
[42:49] side what's the use in speaking of
[42:54] him what's the use of me to preach and
[42:57] sing about
[42:59] him not only do I want to
[43:04] prach Brothers not only do I want to
[43:06] preach about heaven and
[43:08] Eternity let me tell you I want to make
[43:10] it there I want to make it
[43:15] there there's no use in anything
[43:18] else we strive
[43:22] for we fight over this and that
[43:28] what's the use of all of that if we
[43:30] don't make it what's the use
[43:33] brother fight over so many
[43:40] things all that matter
[43:44] is I want to know the other side I want
[43:47] to
[43:51] know waiting for me on the other
[43:54] side it doesn't hurt
[43:56] to leave this
[43:58] world doesn't hurt when I cross the
[44:01] other
[44:01] side there nothing stopping
[44:05] me nothing telling me to stay here that
[44:09] it be so great my
[44:12] desire to be on the other
[44:16] side may it simply be
[44:19] joyful yeah I want to make it
[44:24] there you get
[44:26] I want to make it there you
[44:38] know I believe we need to understand the
[44:41] other side is
[44:44] real times
[44:46] God will break or
[44:52] heart brother brandom says God will
[44:54] break your heart
[44:57] and you need to love him so
[45:00] much that you trust and believe in
[45:04] him even though he breaks your
[45:08] heart because he will not give you
[45:10] everything in this life I want you to
[45:13] understand
[45:14] that God's not going to give you
[45:16] everything in this
[45:19] life he will give you everything just
[45:21] not in this
[45:24] life
[45:27] so I see a man
[45:29] here named
[45:33] Paul he says I Know a Man in
[45:39] Christ we believe he's speaking of
[45:45] himself but maybe he's speaking about
[45:48] something similar to what brother
[45:49] brandom
[45:51] saw maybe he saw his own
[45:54] theop
[45:59] maybe he succeeded to see himself in a
[46:01] different
[46:04] dimension did you know that you are also
[46:07] in another
[46:08] dimension your theophany your
[46:11] body is in another
[46:16] dimension so it says I knew a man in
[46:18] Christ above 14 years
[46:22] ago caught up into the third heaven
[46:29] the first thing I like about this
[46:31] verse is that he
[46:34] says this happened 14 years
[46:41] ago and I asked myself what an impact
[46:44] was this for
[46:46] Paul after 14
[46:49] years having this
[46:53] experience he was so impact
[47:00] acted it was so strong in his heart
[47:06] still and I see the parallel with
[47:08] brother
[47:09] Bram he went beyond the current of
[47:14] time he said since then I cannot be the
[47:18] same and I tell you
[47:22] church if we can taste a little of
[47:24] what's on the other side
[47:27] if God can show
[47:30] us if God could open our eyes a little
[47:33] more I believe he can do
[47:36] it he can open the mind of our
[47:40] spirit the mind of our
[47:42] heart I believe he can give
[47:46] us a taste a
[47:48] little a little from the other side so
[47:52] when a year goes by and another year
[47:54] goes by and another
[47:56] and 10
[47:57] years
[47:59] 14 still something in our
[48:02] heart know that that is
[48:05] real that we can never be the
[48:12] same that's what we
[48:15] desire believe that's what the Holy
[48:17] Ghost
[48:20] is went beyond the curtain of
[48:24] time and when sister
[48:27] when sister hope went she said she
[48:32] tells this is the holy
[48:35] spirit this is the holy
[48:38] spirit don't you realize what the holy
[48:40] spirit
[48:41] is peace of Eternity oh
[48:46] Hallelujah peace of
[48:49] Eternity when you accomplish to come in
[48:51] the Holy
[48:53] Spirit a piece of
[48:58] eternity when God's atmosphere
[49:02] descends you know you're in another
[49:05] place the Bible says we're in Heavenly
[49:08] places seated with Christ
[49:13] Jesus die can come into Heavenly
[49:17] places can only be in the right
[49:24] atmosphere
[49:28] says 14 years ago such and one caught up
[49:31] to the third
[49:36] heaven verse four says how that he was
[49:38] caught up into paradise and heard
[49:40] unspeakable
[49:42] Words which is not lawful for a man to
[49:45] utter brother
[49:48] Bram ask a
[49:51] question and the message questions and
[49:54] answers
[49:57] prach June 28th
[50:05] 1959 yes in 2 Corinthians 12:3 Paul said
[50:09] he knew a man that was caught up into
[50:10] the third
[50:12] heaven forgive me the question
[50:15] was is there more than one
[50:19] Heaven question and he said
[50:23] yes in second iians
[50:29] 123 Paul said he knew a man that was
[50:31] caught up into the third
[50:34] heaven and over in Revelation and so
[50:39] forth there's more than
[50:42] that repeat there's more than
[50:46] three now when we speak of
[50:51] Heavens brother Bram in another message
[50:54] types it as atmospheres di or
[50:58] Dimensions di
[51:05] Dimensions now we presently live in
[51:07] three
[51:12] dimensions to what we can taste or try
[51:16] or
[51:18] feel the dimension of
[51:20] space the dimension of
[51:23] matter and the dimension of
[51:27] time all of those affect
[51:32] us you know it's matter because not
[51:36] floating you know if they hit you you
[51:38] feel something that's
[51:43] matter you know you're being affected by
[51:46] time because every every day we
[51:52] age every day we lose hair
[51:56] every day we get a new
[51:59] wrinkle every day we feel new
[52:04] symptoms so you know you're being
[52:06] affected by
[52:11] time so if we can see space matter and
[52:16] time we see we're affected by all of
[52:20] them but they're not the only Dimensions
[52:24] affecting we're the only ones we have
[52:27] access to
[52:31] but we'll see brother Bram mentions
[52:34] seven
[52:36] dimensions the fourth
[52:39] dimension is the
[52:41] dimension and
[52:44] science where the spirits
[52:46] are where the demons
[52:49] are where the television where the radio
[52:53] is Wii the internet
[52:56] you don't see
[53:00] it between us a lot of information going
[53:05] through your devices have access to
[53:09] that they can obtain
[53:12] information and process
[53:15] it but you and I can't see it
[53:19] right
[53:22] right and the same at
[53:25] there's the
[53:28] spirits the
[53:31] demons where the our thoughts affect our
[53:35] mind sometimes we think all of our
[53:37] thoughts are
[53:38] ours but many of our
[53:42] thoughts are anointed or sent by from
[53:47] Hell there are demons that get swn in
[53:49] our
[53:51] mind but I don't want to speak too much
[53:53] on that maybe the next
[53:58] time now The Fifth
[54:04] Dimension are the ones that died and are
[54:07] lost because they didn't die in
[54:13] Christ and Christ means you died in
[54:15] Christ you went into
[54:19] him not that you only believed in him
[54:22] but that you were in him
[54:25] you were part of
[54:29] him and then the sixth
[54:32] Dimension so one I want to focus
[54:36] on are the ones that have died in
[54:41] Christ brother Bram says in the patmas
[54:48] vision speaking about
[54:51] John and also on Paul
[54:56] he says God transmitted
[54:59] him I don't believe he was took like
[55:02] Paul now open to the third heaven and
[55:10] things or like the precious Holy Spirit
[55:13] did a few years ago here a few weeks
[55:16] ago let me see in other words I was
[55:19] afraid of
[55:22] death and the Holy Spirit taken me over
[55:25] and showed me what it
[55:27] was I want you to begin to see this
[55:31] brother because brother brandham
[55:35] says there has been three
[55:38] Exodus how many remember the first
[55:41] Exodus it's in the book of
[55:44] Exodus delivering Israel from
[55:50] Egypt delivering them and placing
[55:54] them putting them in the promised
[55:57] land the Jordan a type of death are you
[56:01] with me
[56:03] brother now the second Exodus was when
[56:05] the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:08] came and delivered the
[56:13] Jews delivered them from their Jewish
[56:15] tradition and
[56:18] law and then he put him through the
[56:20] Apostle
[56:23] PA because Brown says P fire came in
[56:25] every
[56:27] Exodus then he put them in
[56:31] Grace brother says in this
[56:34] time in this time the
[56:37] third is bringing us out of
[56:41] denominations and putting you
[56:44] in and in one situation he says and
[56:47] lifting
[56:49] them because the promised
[56:52] land is a type of Heaven
[56:55] it's a type of
[56:57] Eternity maybe it's not a perfect
[57:00] type it's a type of the Holy Spirit
[57:04] yes says that in many
[57:07] occasion but he also speaks about
[57:09] lifting
[57:10] us and I'll be reading a few of those
[57:13] things but brother Bram says
[57:16] this and
[57:18] notice God took
[57:23] Joshua before he took the people of
[57:25] Israel to the promised

[57:49] God because he went to the
[57:52] prom showed him the Promised Land
[57:55] he saw the gra he saw the he saw
[58:02] the on the other side
[58:05] of he returned and when he returned he
[58:10] tells the
[58:12] people the land is
[58:14] good is don't
[58:18] fear everything is well on the other
[58:22] side brother Bram says
[58:25] I was afraid of death that's what the
[58:28] prophet
[58:29] says he said I was afraid of
[58:33] death and the Holy Spirit taken me
[58:37] over and showed me what it
[58:40] was aren't you thankful to
[58:43] God in this

[1:03:44] little because I want to speak of the
[1:03:46] sixth Dimension but I want you to
[1:03:48] understand the prophet
[1:03:51] went beyond the other side to tell us
[1:03:55] we're not SP Spirit we're not
[1:03:59] SPS we're not there without doing
[1:04:03] anything there was a
[1:04:06] purpose they were hugging
[1:04:09] huju they weren't just laying
[1:04:12] around sleeping
[1:04:15] around there was
[1:04:17] activity brother BR
[1:04:19] says and we will come
[1:04:22] back and even steps
[1:04:25] on the
[1:04:26] ashes what
[1:04:29] ashes the ashes that were left on this
[1:04:39] Earth it's so
[1:04:45] real this is man's
[1:04:51] day that's why there's so much evil
[1:04:55] so much
[1:04:56] sin and
[1:04:58] sickness
[1:05:03] cancer
[1:05:07] wickedness but the Lord's day is
[1:05:11] coming the Lord's day is
[1:05:14] coming and it will be a different world
[1:05:18] a different
[1:05:19] planet a different
[1:05:23] reality
[1:05:25] brandom
[1:05:27] says the message Fellowship by
[1:05:34] Redemption here is what happens
[1:05:37] then if you die
[1:05:40] now according to the word of
[1:05:46] God you go out of the existence of
[1:05:49] people who can see
[1:05:53] you
[1:05:55] into his
[1:05:58] presence and there you
[1:06:02] live you can look
[1:06:07] back you're not in the world no
[1:06:10] more you're in another
[1:06:14] world and then what do you
[1:06:20] do you're like those Souls under the
[1:06:22] altar saying
[1:06:24] Lord how long will it be
[1:06:27] see you'll never be an
[1:06:30] angel you wasn't made an
[1:06:34] angel you were made men and
[1:06:38] women so you're longing to come
[1:06:43] back because you can see then when you
[1:06:45] get up here and
[1:06:48] say well I see what it's all
[1:06:51] about I know why I had to die
[1:06:56] I know why that taken
[1:06:59] place oh hallelujah
[1:07:03] hallelujah maybe we don't understand it
[1:07:07] we understand why so many evil things
[1:07:10] have to
[1:07:14] happen we don't understand why so much
[1:07:16] pain has to happen but let me tell you
[1:07:20] on the other
[1:07:22] side brhom says you can look
[1:07:25] back you can look
[1:07:29] back now I understand Lord now I
[1:07:33] understand what I
[1:07:34] did my mind will be
[1:07:37] clear my thoughts will be different
[1:07:40] thoughts let me tell you no wonder Paul
[1:07:43] said I heard
[1:07:47] words possible to utter
[1:07:50] here GL to the name of the
[1:07:52] Lord it's something this world wouldn't
[1:07:56] understand something this mind couldn't
[1:08:01] understand understand God's
[1:08:04] things but one day I'll receive a new
[1:08:07] mind new thoughts
[1:08:10] hallelu and we'll look back we'll say
[1:08:14] Lord you were
[1:08:17] right I
[1:08:19] complained I complain I
[1:08:22] cried
[1:08:24] right
[1:08:39] Lord Brother brandom
[1:08:45] repeats we weren't made to be
[1:08:48] Angels
[1:08:51] Spirits we were made to be men men and
[1:08:59] women God has made us God made us that
[1:09:02] way
[1:09:03] for but brother brandham says you never
[1:09:12] die Jesus said he that Hearth my words
[1:09:15] and believeth on him that sent me has
[1:09:17] everlasting
[1:09:19] life you can't
[1:09:22] die you can't
[1:09:26] die you die to the Mortal
[1:09:30] part but you're alive
[1:09:35] here your spirit's right here with
[1:09:39] Christ then you say Lord how long is
[1:09:43] it because you wasn't made to be
[1:09:48] there you wasn't made that because
[1:09:50] you're a human
[1:09:52] being
[1:09:57] and you're longing to come back into
[1:09:59] this body perfect
[1:10:02] again we'll speak more on that
[1:10:06] later and he said just a little while
[1:10:12] longer now I know brother Bram later
[1:10:15] clarifies this is speaking about the
[1:10:16] Jews
[1:10:17] also this
[1:10:21] uh but I believe there's scripture that
[1:10:23] to every
[1:10:25] Mortal in other words we can learn from
[1:10:28] this for
[1:10:30] us he said just a little while
[1:10:32] longer until your fellow
[1:10:35] servants has
[1:10:38] suffered like the martyrs did back there
[1:10:42] then you will
[1:10:43] return comaling
[1:10:46] down how
[1:10:49] tremendous plenty to learn only
[1:10:52] here after

[1:11:02] petroleum and what you're made up
[1:11:05] of you go into the fourth
[1:11:08] di out of that into The Fifth Dimension

[1:11:19] altar God is in the
[1:11:22] seventh we're right
[1:11:24] below that in the six when
[1:11:29] we then when God lets your spirit

[1:12:49] God Brothers let me tell
[1:12:52] you
[1:12:54] one more
[1:12:56] time this is just the preparation before
[1:12:59] the other
[1:13:02] side I was
[1:13:04] watching all the preparations done for
[1:13:06] the my birthday party on
[1:13:11] Friday and I say wow so much preparation
[1:13:14] was needed for three
[1:13:15] hours just for three
[1:13:21] hours and sometimes with think about
[1:13:23] this life and wonder why do we need so
[1:13:26] prepation this life is only a
[1:13:30] preparation we will be on the other side
[1:13:34] don't be AF don't
[1:13:37] worry I know it looks like it's a
[1:13:39] lot we're headed to
[1:13:42] Eternity an
[1:13:44] eternity where we will work for
[1:13:47] God do something for God
[1:13:50] there at least a thousand years
[1:13:54] so we need
[1:13:56] preparation I need
[1:13:58] preparation if you're not
[1:14:01] preparing you have nothing to prepare
[1:14:04] for but I want to prepare I want to know
[1:14:08] there's
[1:14:09] another I need to
[1:14:11] be Lord you need more need more
[1:14:17] fath I need to
[1:14:19] grow need to
[1:14:21] reflect beat me
[1:14:25] more I am your
[1:14:29] [Music]
[1:14:40] reflection message confirmation and
[1:14:47] evidence so they came out of up out of
[1:14:50] Egypt and they came to a place called
[1:14:52] Kadesh Barne
[1:15:01] I believe it was a there that Joshua
[1:15:03] great warrior among them went over to
[1:15:05] spy out the land he crossed
[1:15:12] Jordan and went over to the other
[1:15:16] land I like that the other
[1:15:21] land and came back with the evidence
[1:15:24] that the land was
[1:15:26] good that God's word was
[1:15:29] perfect his promises was
[1:15:32] true and he had the
[1:15:36] evidence that the land was
[1:15:39] there he had hold of
[1:15:44] something the land was exactly what God
[1:15:47] promised to can you imagine Joshua and
[1:15:52] Caleb so many years in
[1:15:57] bondage and the prophet Moses
[1:16:01] arrives and he tells
[1:16:03] them God is going to take us to another
[1:16:06] land God has a different place for
[1:16:10] us I imagine he C
[1:16:14] to I imagine they said if Moses said it
[1:16:17] I believe
[1:16:19] it the prophet said it I believe it I
[1:16:23] believe it hallelujah
[1:16:26] hallelujah I believe what he
[1:16:28] preached I believe what he
[1:16:31] said brother says and Joshua to that but
[1:16:35] he didn't
[1:16:37] know so he went to the other
[1:16:41] side and he had the
[1:16:44] evidence the
[1:16:46] confirmation that the land was
[1:16:49] there he had held to
[1:16:52] something or could hold on to something
[1:16:54] let's hold on to
[1:16:56] that this life is pointless without
[1:17:01] it but it makes all the sense if we hold
[1:17:04] on to
[1:17:06] that now I understand why we must go
[1:17:09] through because there's something
[1:17:11] greater waiting over
[1:17:18] there he had hold of something that the
[1:17:21] land was exactly that God promised
[1:17:27] two men was packing a bunch of
[1:17:29] grapes hallelu
[1:17:33] Hallelujah the grapes represent wine
[1:17:37] where they make
[1:17:40] wine and wine represents
[1:17:43] Revelation and God
[1:17:45] allowed in this
[1:17:49] time not just take the prophet beyond
[1:17:51] the current of time
[1:17:54] or he lifted him with seven
[1:17:56] angels to Heavenly
[1:17:59] places he gave him Bunches of
[1:18:03] Grace gave him the word the
[1:18:10] Revelation the people could taste of it
[1:18:13] oh hallelujah
[1:18:17] hallelujah the people could
[1:18:19] taste you
[1:18:21] notice we're not
[1:18:24] t a pcal holy
[1:18:27] ghost or a Wesley and Holy
[1:18:30] Ghost we're tasting the holy
[1:18:33] spirit with the
[1:18:36] Revelation with the
[1:18:39] Revelation pure word of
[1:18:42] God for our
[1:18:46] Hallelujah they're not old
[1:18:49] graes fresh
[1:18:51] graes that God given us in this
[1:18:54] time and there we receive our Holy
[1:18:58] Spirit that's where we receive
[1:19:00] it the fresh word of the
[1:19:09] hour it was a confirmation that God had
[1:19:11] kept
[1:19:13] his then Israel crossed the Jordan and
[1:19:15] went to the promis land and Joshua
[1:19:18] divided up the land for they were in
[1:19:21] peace they Nation they had their
[1:19:25] churches they planted their CS they
[1:19:27] raised their children they took them to
[1:19:30] church and they lived
[1:19:35] happy and God put fear in all the na
[1:19:37] other nations of them and they were
[1:19:39] great
[1:19:42] people going to jump
[1:19:46] ahead paragraph
[1:19:49] 36 then one day come to the
[1:19:56] paragraph 37 but he come to his cish
[1:19:59] barnea the Judgment SE was KES
[1:20:03] Bara the Judgment seat was KES
[1:20:08] bar and he came to
[1:20:13] Kish where upon Him bore he bore the
[1:20:16] sins of the
[1:20:17] world but he crossed also the
[1:20:20] Jordan that we call the Jordan of
[1:20:23] death he went over into the other
[1:20:27] land and was dead for three days and
[1:20:30] three
[1:20:32] nights he died Till The Sun quit
[1:20:35] shining oh
[1:20:40] Lord he died till the Earth had a
[1:20:42] nervous
[1:20:44] breakdown it shook the rocks out of the
[1:20:47] mountains he
[1:20:49] died and on the third day he rose back
[1:20:52] again with the
[1:20:54] evidence that there is a
[1:20:57] land where a man can live and not
[1:21:01] die he returned back from that
[1:21:05] land there is life after deathu
[1:21:09] Hallelujah Jesus Christ showed us that
[1:21:14] there's life after
[1:21:17] death we shouldn't have a
[1:21:19] doubt we shouldn't doubt it
[1:21:23] in
[1:21:24] question life after
[1:21:31] death now he says to his
[1:21:35] disciples I'm going to give you the
[1:21:37] earnest of
[1:21:39] this I'm going to give you the
[1:21:43] confirmation as they did to Abraham with
[1:21:46] circumcision but wait up there at
[1:21:48] Jerusalem until you have got the
[1:21:51] confirmation until you have the
[1:21:53] evidence and they
[1:21:57] waited on the 10th day there came a
[1:22:00] sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty
[1:22:03] Wind that filled all the building where
[1:22:05] they were
[1:22:06] sitting and they were all filled with
[1:22:08] the
[1:22:09] Holy Tong of fire sat upon them the
[1:22:12] musicians can
[1:22:14] come tongues of fire sat upon
[1:22:20] them and they were all filled and began
[1:22:23] to speak with other languages as the
[1:22:24] spirit gave them utterance what was it
[1:22:28] it was the
[1:22:29] evidence that our
[1:22:31] Joshua Jehovah
[1:22:34] savior had returned from the
[1:22:37] dead and given us an
[1:22:40] evidence that when we
[1:22:44] die we live again on the other
[1:22:47] side
[1:22:49] confirmation
[1:22:51] confirming
[1:22:53] giving the evidence of
[1:22:57] it let us all
[1:23:19] stand did say Leon random the brandom
[1:23:23] [Music]
[1:23:24] says
[1:23:31] 3 then one day down come the great Chief
[1:23:36] Captain the Lord
[1:23:39] Jesus and he began to tell them of
[1:23:41] another
[1:23:46] land he said in my father's house is
[1:23:48] many
[1:23:50] mansions if it was not so
