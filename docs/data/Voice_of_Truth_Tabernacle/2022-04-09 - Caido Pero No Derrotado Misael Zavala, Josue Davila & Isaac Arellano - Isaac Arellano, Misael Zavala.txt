[Music] [Music] we've come this far by faith [Music] trusting in his holy word oh he's never failed me yet he's never failed me yet [Music] we can't turn back now we've come this far by faith [Music] i know oh we can't turn back now we've come this far by faith [Music] we've come this [Music] trusting in his holy word [Music] you believe it we can't turn back now we've gone this far by faith [Music] [Applause] [Applause] and the lord said to her two nations are in your womb and two peoples from within you shall be divided the one shall be stronger than the other the older shall serve the younger when her days to give birth were completed behold there were two there were twins in her womb you may be seated we always have those two natures in us he had supernatural signs supernatural signs but he was also born with the two natures he had to struggle he had to fight down but not out man and then chapter 64. it's called the the anointing for life or of life from 1953 alert but first i would like to read this quote priest in 1960. and how and how it could come from that perfect pure elected holy consecrated father or mother so to base that god calls by election it must be no matter how good your father or mother was important no matter how good your father and mother was how nice they was how much christians your father and mother was it still lies to you as an individual you're standing before god and this i believe it it correlates well with the youth por cabezes because sometimes we think just because we're born in the gospel or because our father or mother we don't have to fight we don't have anything to overcome no but we should take into account that we have both natures william branham had a few nervous conditions he had to go through this table responsibilities wanted to live his life his life without responsibilities or restrictions and then unfortunately this attitude was inducing him to a wrong path and bill look for the right moment to talk about this with his son one one night bill was praying and he saw a vision of his son and he was in a party where they were drinking jumping jumping out of a window and falling until he hit his head fuera control out of control empanada the vision was was finished without a final conclusion and uh bill was was uh put in suspense he was sweating and he prayed that billy didn't have a uh an excuse his father was a man of god filled with the holy spirit billy paul was given the privilege to see the angel of god if he snuck into the house and he was drunk or he smelled like alcohol and bill allowed his son to sleep in as long as he wanted to and when you when he woke up billy paul had planned to go and see a friend established automobile and bill was washing his car and here we can see that that one was also young and one always tries to keep things from their parents and one thing i've always told my children sometimes you think that you deceive us or that you know maybe we may not ever find out what i always tell them many times you think one is dumb but only dumb ones are them diablo because the devil is making you dumb why because the only ones that are persecuted for that are going to be you know the you're starting on the wrong and i can no longer have you there at the reunions because that harms my ministry very much no solo eso and not only that puedesi or leave the house and go to the world decision hard decisions because when the devil deceives you you go for the easy thing which is the world apart and with the firmness of what it was going to tell us but first putting forth love sometimes uh we as parents we catch something in our children and we don't wait for the moment to talk to them sometimes we don't we don't have the discernment of when to stop hitting them sometimes we hit them and so that doesn't work we scream at them and we're seeing the two natures the prophet the prophet with the nature of god standing by the word paul and billy paul on the other side of the scale going to the world and he says that he's the son of a prophet or he's the son of the pastor moment one moment in our lives the devil is going to ask and the devil is going to ask us and we're going to make a mistake but we have to fight a true nature the nature of god because of which you're here because of what you were called you weren't called here to lose yourself from a young age sometimes we want the sunday school teachers in two hours on a sunday to do the work that we should be doing the entire week sometimes we don't we don't uh see the consequences when billy decided to go from his home the story says you can read it that he went to go fishing and he found the lake and he went to the hospital because his throat hurts found him in the hospital he was already he was purple and almost without life and he prayed for him and he was healed pero unfortunately this encounter with death to the crooked way to the evil way he was going to need a stronger lesson than that to straighten his path out and sometimes we don't understand the first time [Music] 34 verse one is estaba now the daughter of leah of leah whom uh nadina the daughter of leah whom she had born to jacob went out to see the woman of the land with her and humiliated her practically he practically raped her what does it refer to when it says go to see the woman of the land she went to go once again fell into the hospital from being drunk so much he had ulcers in his stomach and the prophet had gone on what do you see there esta la cruz he said there's a cross they say and in the midst of in the middle of that cross there are two ways they say uh and at the end when he was healed the second time he said libro the book says that billy paul returned there el centro de la cruz to the middle of the cross this time he decided by jesus christ yesterday and this and tonight with all my heart if you're fine and you pray god will be there el diablo the devil will also be there you're going to get to the side and if you decide wrongly regression it's time for you to go back to the cross thank you brothers god bless you hello [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] heavenly father thank you lord because you're always being good with us every single day we fail but here you are to lift us up again and lord we come here today surrendered to you may speak your words in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Applause] [Music] it twice the last two times i've spent i was in the world i was falling but i wasn't fully defeated that's how some of us are man get off if you can please open up your bibles marco cinco matthew 5. 25. i was asking the lord because the theme is we're still talking about jacob but god gave me this it says he and it says like this is but a young girl that suffered from the age of 12 with a blood illness and had suffered from many medics and had wasted all that she had earned and nothing had had made her profit and it went worse for her cuando hablar de jesus when she heard talking about jesus jesus when she heard about jesus she be she came behind the multitude and touched his garment porque de sia because it would say sito if i'd only touch his garment i shall be healed and instantly the the her sickness was healed and she felt in her body that from that touch she was healed especially and knowing the jesus himself the power that came out of him turning to the multitudes who has touched my garments and his disciples say unto him thou seest the multitude through throgging thee and says thou who touched me pero el and you looked around about to see here that her who had done this thing entonces but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth and be whole of thy plague sickness of blood you know jesus was on the way to go see the daughter of jairo pero adi wait she said no she said i must be healed i shall be saved the blood issue in those times um rejected [Music] if i can simply just touch his garments i shall be whole he said our lord jesus christ and i have the opportunity like i have said before the the seguir adios to follow god recorded and now remind myself and say well you were lost just the same way our lord jesus christ had the determination when he was carrying that cross angry when he was carrying that cross full of blood he had that determination is i'm going to do what my father commanded me to do he did it for juventus he did it for you and i yeah i have the determination he said i'm going to do it for my son i'm going to do it for my daughter amen why don't we have that determination when we draw near to the thomas we were 100 we were with joy but i asked myself this is my little cow what am i doing i asked myself don't value what we have brothers questions do you remember that day when god rescued you i yeah [Music] she was very happy that i had to come back to church and she asked me how i was doing yeah i'm doing well i said he may be all emailed he said and she saw me and looked at me she said you know there's going to be false there's going to be defeats you might have to have that determination surrender what are we doing sometimes [Music] i said up already mckinnon indeed there's days i want to give up i don't you want to go to church they want to go to work i didn't want to preach today with a bad mood and i give thanks to brother eric for no matter how many times we fail we have to continue in the path of god remembering what god has done for us i remember jacob el pelio why do we take the time to have chime with god for me he died for you and i hey he's done it all oh it's our turn do don't take advantage i don't take advantage of that or we don't take advantage of that the message total deliverance priest in 1959 all jesus works was completed everything was complete total delivered he because he defeated the devil it took all the principalities and powers dictate to us nosotros christianos christ deliverables christians follow with the holy ghost we don't have to have a devil dictate christians christ [Applause] [Applause] with us [Applause] [Music] i won't leave from this place see me bendy without being blessed [Music] [Applause] [Music] let us have that just by we have to help one another voice of truth tabernacle amen [Applause] truly god's word is beautiful amen amen all right well we're in the title of i mean the subject jacob and issa and our title is down but not out brother that there are two nations in her womb pueblos the bible says that there are twins born esau came out first why would jacob want to grab his heels anybody ask yourself that again from the heels because jacob wanted to be so born first sido primero that was mind-blowing for me because jacob unconsciously thank you wanted and jacob a plain man dwelling in tents now genesis 25 28 henny sees say it again 25 28. my only verse of this night it says thank you oh thank you and east isaac loved esau because he did eat of his vengeance but rebecca loved jacob yeah i love him more that's what happened here and this made them yes a dysfunctional family una familia this dysfunctional because isaac loved esau and rebecca loved jacob when parents have favorites when the father is still in fabulous jacob is trying to prove himself to isaac and esau is trying to win rebecca how is love supposed to be is love supposed to be any is love supposed to be by your choice or by what you do god teaches us now esau comes from hunting the bible says and he says that he came to jacob it is a que vino jacob esau coming from hunting came to jail that that wasn't the first time he saw kept coming back kept coming back essene was called iran esau's descendants are now called esa no sonia reach espresso and says despise his birthright especially when he was eating drinking nor when he time for him to repent even with the lentils in his teeth like if god was giving him time to repent as he drank as he ate he could have still repented even when he rose up when he got up he still could have repented oh he went by his own way anton says despise the birthright because it's never too late but i said la cosa correcta to do things right back to the correctness it's never too late to do what god is asking of us now the bible says isaac were talking and isaac was of old age yesterday he was blinding jacob was deceived the same manner what the generation of jacob did in that modern age the next generation did even more separa stands up god i already served you ten years give me my pay okay someone that feels they're entitled pero dios preferenda but for the hunger i'm always leaving you up in the air so i want to finish off hey para tell me finish off if the musicians can come in please stand with me [Music] i want to remind you of something now when god spoke to moses he said unto him i am the god of abraham isaac
