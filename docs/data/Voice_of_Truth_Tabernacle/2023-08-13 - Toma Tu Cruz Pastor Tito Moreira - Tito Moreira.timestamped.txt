[26:16] [Music]
[26:27] thank you
[26:29] [Music]
[26:55] my God
[27:00] he wants to speak this morning
[27:04] wants to speak to us is
[27:12] willing to listen to his voice
[27:15] you can open your Bibles with me
[27:23] first follow me to First
[27:26] timothyro cuatro chapter four
[27:30] verse 16.
[27:32] it's great to see everyone
[27:38] to serve the Lord together
[27:41] it's a group God decided on
[27:45] we would be together we will fight
[27:48] together
[27:49] and we would arrive together
[27:52] so we are proud
[28:01] Circa
[28:04] we're speaking on conquering ourselves
[28:34] and so the doctrine continue in them for
[28:37] in doing this Thou shalt both save
[28:39] thyself
[28:41] repeat save thyself
[28:49] there's nothing we can do to save
[28:51] ourselves
[28:53] but I don't think that's all the stories
[28:57] because the word of God also tells us
[28:59] that if doing and doing this
[29:03] we will save thyself
[29:05] that's interesting
[29:08] this is now follow me to Matthew chapter
[29:10] 16.
[29:13] this message is the second part of the
[29:16] last one I preached
[29:18] on denying yourself
[29:25] where it says take up thy cross
[29:29] Matthew 16 24.
[29:36] me again
[29:42] Jesus said then Jesus then said Jesus
[29:46] unto his disciples If any man will come
[29:48] after me let him deny himself and take
[29:49] up his cross and follow me
[29:52] now notice how he says
[30:01] for whosoever will save his life shall
[30:03] lose it and whosoever will lose his life
[30:05] for my sake shall find it
[30:13] for what is a man propheted if he shall
[30:16] gain the whole world and lose his own
[30:17] soul or what shall a man give in
[30:19] exchange for his soul
[30:22] Lando
[30:30] and I'd like to message title my message
[30:33] be your own hero let us pray my only
[30:37] father
[30:38] in this moment
[30:41] we ask that it's your Holy Spirit
[30:44] moving through US
[30:47] lord it's not the brother next to me
[30:52] that needs you no is
[30:57] not a person not a sinner
[31:02] I need you more today
[31:05] I'm the one that's coming in need
[31:09] I desire you to help me
[31:15] into our expectations
[31:22] this morning foreign
[32:01] the
[32:30] I have two inside of me
[32:33] spiritual there's a spiritual
[32:35] there's a carnal man
[32:39] this is a man that is
[32:58] a war of
[33:01] that's how God wants
[33:06] it is
[34:28] this is the son of God
[34:51] deny yourself
[35:13] he is not saying
[35:16] he is saying
[35:34] that's all that we're carrying
[35:39] the man actually carries his cross
[35:42] himself
[35:48] and has taken up his cross automatically
[35:58] the only
[36:01] inch yes
[36:03] this is the same I don't want you to
[36:05] take up other things
[36:26] it's your own cross
[36:31] the man has taken up his cross
[36:36] has decided
[36:39] that he does not control his Destiny
[36:43] he is not in control
[36:47] and what he does
[36:55] absorbiendo suvida the cross is an
[36:57] interest that's completely absorbing him
[37:03] and be carrying other things La Cruz the
[37:14] it's an interference in your life
[37:19] too overwhelming
[37:21] entertained by other things
[37:26] if the cross is not the only thing you
[37:28] carry you will get it
[37:34] stay halfway
[37:36] foreign
[38:06] in the message questions and answers
[38:38] [Music]
[38:58] now just a moment if you want to see it
[39:00] I'll take you back to Bethlehem where I
[39:02] was born and I'll let you know how it
[39:04] happened back there
[39:06] it wasn't that
[39:09] he pointed them a future place
[39:13] if they wanted to know
[39:16] in other words he says
[39:28] um reduce
[40:29] foreign
[41:11] [Music]
[41:30] Jesus Christ
[41:32] foreign
[41:57] [Music]
[42:18] they need
[42:22] there is no Health without the cross are
[42:25] you with me
[42:33] I want you to understand this
[42:38] now the cross is
[42:43] more than a symbol of Torment uh
[42:49] nowadays we see the cross
[42:57] the Romans used to kill our Lord our
[43:00] leaders
[43:08] people carry a cross necklace
[43:17] many people don't understand what the
[43:19] cross means
[43:21] the cross for the Lord Jesus Christ
[43:25] was his purpose
[43:29] Jesus Christ it's his purpose
[43:36] and so yes
[44:37] foreign
[45:09] [Music]
[45:44] some people say my wife my husband
[45:46] they're my cross
[45:48] they're completely wrong
[45:51] for Jesus
[45:54] the cross symbolize
[45:56] what he came to do
[46:00] that's why he foreign
[46:33] when Judas betrayed him
[46:38] carried his cross daily
[46:41] foreign
[47:35] for purpose
[47:39] oh yeah
[47:42] or De La Cruz now the cross
[47:45] is something tough
[47:48] but it's our purpose
[47:51] I want you to not see the cross this
[47:54] morning
[47:59] like a waist pain
[48:03] or the Temptation you have to overcome
[48:07] or the person you have to bear okay I
[48:11] want you to see the cross
[48:17] as the purpose God has given you
[48:20] because every one of us
[48:23] God gave a purpose
[48:31] you realize your purpose
[48:38] of God
[48:42] foreign
[49:55] that's life
[49:57] whatever
[49:58] foreign
[50:39] do we flee from the cross see yes it's
[50:43] natural it's normal
[50:45] even the Lord Jesus Christ foreign
[51:25] foreign
[52:10] I don't have time
[52:14] to be stopping
[52:17] come on church
[52:20] now we're forgetting why we come for
[52:22] right
[52:23] why do we come to church
[52:30] do you come for God to give you
[52:32] something
[52:39] la Cruz
[52:40] the cross
[52:44] is
[52:46] it's something we despise
[52:52] normally with the spices
[52:55] because it's a humiliation
[52:59] so carry across is a humiliation
[53:04] to address like a good woman is a human
[53:08] being
[53:20] that seems like humiliation
[53:26] we don't like it
[53:27] we don't like the cross
[53:31] because if it was really our calling our
[53:34] person it won't be something easy
[53:39] to do is not easy
[53:42] I didn't call you for a picnic
[53:46] give your entire life
[53:49] be an example for the rest
[53:53] the young ladies
[54:13] Jonah did not want to know
[54:17] we can't blame him we're the same
[54:20] okay
[54:22] we don't want to do what God has called
[54:24] us for
[54:25] many times God has told me
[54:29] for something hot
[54:31] and you want to stay close
[55:05] we don't like it
[55:23] yes brother
[55:25] for
[55:39] something more comfortable TLC yes or
[55:43] yes
[55:46] that we're on the ship to tarshas
[55:51] and not towards Nineveh
[56:00] we're on a ship to tarshish
[56:05] how sad
[56:26] [Music]
[57:06] we want to avoid it very good but I
[57:10] could see don't wean remember
[57:13] this morning
[57:20] we look for other challenges
[57:36] only do your own works
[57:38] so you can only give me your works
[57:41] your leftovers
[57:43] forgive me so you can give me your
[57:45] leftovers
[57:55] before going and carrying our cross
[58:00] we attempt television
[58:04] we attempt social media
[58:08] we attempt our tarshish
[58:11] everything but the
[58:14] crosses we attempt excuses
[58:20] I can't do so much for you anymore
[58:25] that's what the Bible says
[58:33] they had this other
[58:37] and they didn't attend the call
[58:42] but when we find out
[58:45] that things are not getting better
[58:50] we have to come to the point
[58:53] where we notice
[58:56] when I evade my cross
[58:59] it's not improving my life
[59:03] that is
[59:22] falling to pieces
[59:47] it's not improving
[59:51] things
[59:54] worsening foreign
[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:20] but we see it
[1:00:23] it's heavy
[1:00:26] okay
[1:00:28] you know what makes it heavier
[1:00:31] is
[1:00:33] it's not only a wood
[1:00:38] en
[1:00:40] but your flesh has to be crucified
[1:00:44] you're a carnal man
[1:00:47] you need to crucify him on there
[1:00:51] wow foreign
[1:01:32] don't think that Jesus wants you to take
[1:01:34] up a cross with the end without anything
[1:01:38] you have to be on the cross being
[1:01:44] foreign
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:02:44] slave
[1:03:03] man that's right
[1:03:08] no one else will do this for you it's
[1:03:11] your own cross
[1:03:13] because he said everything he could do
[1:03:15] for us
[1:03:19] come on Church
[1:03:21] don't you believe it
[1:03:24] is
[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:04:01] that's what I want you to understand
[1:04:03] Jesus
[1:04:05] Jesus can take you so far
[1:04:09] and then you need to take the daggers
[1:04:14] fire delivered the people from Egypt
[1:04:18] cover them protected them
[1:04:21] when the answer into the promised land
[1:04:26] that didn't mean God left them but he
[1:04:30] said
[1:04:32] the word continues through you
[1:04:34] continue the work continues
[1:04:42] whatever way you want to take it I will
[1:04:46] be with you tomorrow
[1:05:00] bravery
[1:05:57] desire it
[1:06:17] because we don't want to make the
[1:06:19] sacrifice
[1:06:23] very little benefit
[1:06:26] when the pastor does his job
[1:06:39] when you do your job when you
[1:06:43] said find out
[1:06:47] that Jesus is telling you take up your
[1:06:50] cross
[1:06:59] he knew what he come for
[1:07:01] what he says take up your cross do your
[1:07:06] job
[1:07:07] I want to get in this here
[1:07:14] Taki
[1:07:21] greater than Solomon is here like
[1:07:23] listeners
[1:07:27] the church needs tonight not a soft
[1:07:30] hybrid something
[1:07:35] soft and flabby like the churches
[1:07:38] just make a confession be baptized
[1:07:45] so be a Christian is self-denial
[1:07:48] Cristiano
[1:07:52] deny yourself
[1:08:02] on good days you
[1:08:07] need to take your cross
[1:08:10] sometimes
[1:08:13] when everything is
[1:08:15] and when we're depressed
[1:08:37] either way
[1:08:44] blando
[1:08:49] is cristianos
[1:08:56] today is so soft and people call
[1:08:58] themselves Christians when used to mean
[1:09:00] death to confess Christ
[1:09:04] and you had to depend on him daily
[1:09:07] [Music]
[1:09:09] for everything you had need of
[1:09:16] when we
[1:09:18] are
[1:09:19] having come to this place
[1:09:23] where we need him every day
[1:09:28] that's because we're not taking up our
[1:09:31] cross
[1:09:35] when there's a day that you said today
[1:09:37] was a good easy day to be a Christian is
[1:09:40] because you're relaxed
[1:10:11] to him
[1:10:15] because the cross leads you to him
[1:10:23] it's not easy to carry Titus moreda yeah
[1:10:27] if there's something difficult is to
[1:10:29] carry Titus moreda cuando cargo when I
[1:10:32] carry him
[1:10:34] he complains to me
[1:10:39] when I bring him by force to church he
[1:10:43] complains to me
[1:10:47] to give him the things of this world
[1:10:51] he complains to him
[1:10:56] they're complaining
[1:11:00] I imagine the one next to Jesus
[1:11:11] and save us
[1:11:19] you're making me do this
[1:11:23] God was good
[1:11:26] you wouldn't let you do that
[1:11:37] kindness is in that cross
[1:11:41] but
[1:11:42] I must do something
[1:11:45] and it's a carry myself
[1:11:50] crucify myself
[1:11:53] no one else will Pastor the pastor won't
[1:11:57] do it
[1:11:59] husband the wife will not do it yeah
[1:12:08] you must take up your own
[1:12:11] make the sacrifices
[1:12:37] with yourself
[1:12:42] says
[1:12:50] Calvary they misunderstood
[1:12:54] when they all denied him and went away
[1:12:59] foreign
[1:14:43] bring yourself down
[1:15:20] for us proposition
[1:16:21] foreign
[1:17:18] Hallelujah
[1:17:20] La Cruz the cross
[1:17:23] it's tough
[1:17:25] La Cruces mortal the cross is deadly
[1:17:30] Cruz is effective but the cross is
[1:17:32] effective
[1:17:41] the only effective thing is the cross
[1:17:44] there was no other way foreign
[1:18:35] yeah let's get foreign
[1:18:50] others
[1:19:26] has nothing to do
[1:19:30] this
[1:19:33] done for you
[1:19:41] only you know what you need to take
[1:19:44] Solutions
[1:19:46] only you know the sacrifice that must be
[1:19:49] made
[1:19:49] the others won't understand
[1:19:53] I was thinking the other day
[1:20:00] I was thinking I have it's been a couple
[1:20:02] days since I don't run he
[1:20:12] I felt a little girl to go out for a run
[1:20:15] there's some days I can't even jog he
[1:20:18] is
[1:20:22] I began to jog I didn't even run I was
[1:20:25] jogging
[1:20:26] I said I'm so heavy physics how hard is
[1:20:31] it to carry myself
[1:20:36] and I began to think
[1:20:43] I got even more tired
[1:20:48] but I kept jogging
[1:20:51] on a hill
[1:20:54] Europeans okay
[1:20:58] I believe I would have gone faster
[1:21:01] walking than how I was jogging porque
[1:21:09] one little step at a time
[1:21:13] but I thought
[1:21:15] if anyone else saw me
[1:21:20] they say oh I feel pity for that person
[1:21:23] they're not giving all their effort but
[1:21:26] only I know
[1:21:29] Victoria but I mean what that victory
[1:21:31] means for me
[1:21:34] I don't know
[1:21:36] how hard is to give those steps
[1:21:44] my cough is not gone I had phlegm
[1:21:48] my glasses were fogging
[1:21:52] and all I thought of was giving up
[1:21:59] my mind
[1:22:02] my body would say stop already
[1:22:06] my waist began to hurt
[1:22:15] if something happens
[1:22:24] but only I knew the battle that I was
[1:22:27] fighting in my mind
[1:22:29] and I said that's what the same with the
[1:22:32] Christians
[1:22:34] people don't know what you're fighting
[1:22:36] [Music]
[1:22:41] they're not putting an effort
[1:22:47] but sometimes giving one more step
[1:22:51] requires everything of you
[1:22:55] one more step forward so let's see just
[1:22:58] to sing
[1:23:02] and so God helps him
[1:23:06] he wants everything that's in US
[1:23:12] I began to hear a song
[1:23:15] I was listening to Christian music
[1:23:20] I heard a song that was saying
[1:23:24] I will carry you all the way
[1:23:30] I know I meant the Lord Jesus
[1:23:34] but in that moment God told me
[1:23:38] you need to carry yourself all the way
[1:23:40] you need to be strong
[1:23:44] if you aren't strong
[1:23:47] you won't get there
[1:23:51] foreign
[1:23:57] so I saw then
[1:24:02] I need to be my own hero
[1:24:07] for no one else will be the hero for me
[1:24:19] I need to be strong
[1:24:25] if I want this man to get there
[1:24:30] I need to be brave
[1:24:33] I need to fight
[1:24:37] against myself
[1:24:51] doing it for your own good
[1:24:54] amen
[1:25:00] please sound with me
[1:25:17] as we're closing
[1:25:29] I want to tell you
[1:25:32] be your own hero
[1:25:37] Valley
[1:25:39] do something brave for yourself
[1:25:42] Paul tells Timothy
[1:25:47] I fought a good battle
[1:25:50] but now it's your turn
[1:25:54] I can watch you this is he says take
[1:25:58] heed of thyself
[1:26:19] no one else will
[1:26:25] God is saying
[1:26:32] fight for what I've given you
[1:26:34] said to put be your own hero
[1:26:40] make yourself proud
[1:26:43] I've given you everything you need
[1:26:46] to see I'm giving you everything you
