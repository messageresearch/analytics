[23:05] live the life of gratitude I live every
[23:08] single

[23:17] one or two witnesses here
[23:20] tonight that can say that you have been
[23:23] in their
[23:26] lives you have walked with
[23:28] them and you've been with them every
[23:31] single step of the
[23:33] way we thank you be with us

[23:55] honor and we thank you in this evening
[23:59] in the name of the Lord Jesus
[24:02] Christ amen you may be
[24:04] seated I'm gonna try to wake you
[24:08] up let's be honest it's
[24:11] Friday cold and you kind of want to be
[24:15] in somewhere nice and warm and
[24:19] comfortable but tonight we're going to
[24:22] take a different
[24:25] view of of chapter six of Daniel
[24:30] our brother our beloved
[24:32] pastor and our brother blast last week
[24:35] preached
[24:37] about but with our brother VI and
[24:39] brother
[24:41] tonight want to bring it in this
[24:46] angle yeah we're going to call it
[24:48] silencing the
[24:55] critics siling the critics how many want
[24:58] to do that how many want that
[25:01] power cuz it's needed of a great
[25:04] power it's needed of a great
[25:07] power to shut out those
[25:10] voices telling you every single
[25:14] day you ain't
[25:16] nobody you you're you're not going to
[25:18] amount to
[25:21] nothing you you're just a
[25:24] showoff it's just an emotion you're
[25:27] feeling
[25:29] but the Apostle Paul says
[25:32] it right there in Philippians chap
[25:39] 3:3 it says Brethren I count not myself
[25:42] to be a apprehended he
[25:46] said but this one thing I
[25:49] do forgetting those things which are
[25:51] behind
[25:54] me listen now and reaching
[25:58] forth unto those things which are
[26:02] before and I press towards the Mark
[26:06] Paul all right for the prize of the
[26:11] High Calling of God in Christ
[26:15] Jesus you got to let things behind you
[26:18] Brothers you got to let the critics
[26:21] behind
[26:23] you cuz if Daniel had paid
[26:26] attention cuz if Daniel
[26:29] had paid
[26:30] attention to those
[26:32] voices to those
[26:34] princes he would have never opened up
[26:36] his
[26:39] windows he would have never ever been
[26:41] able to stand with such
[26:44] Valor such
[26:47] courage to and worshiping God with all
[26:50] of his
[26:52] Hearts cuz I would I
[26:55] rather be criticized
[26:59] to try to do something for
[27:01] God and to be criticized and doing
[27:05] nothing because in this world in this
[27:07] life we're going to be criticized no
[27:09] matter
[27:11] what amen or amen you're going to be
[27:14] criticized whether you do good or
[27:17] bad and
[27:19] often the
[27:21] critics those that criticize other
[27:25] people criticize them
[27:28] and they reveal something that they
[27:30] themselves are
[27:35] lacking the princes and the
[27:39] presidents and I love
[27:41] this had to
[27:44] assemble the devil has to get
[27:48] together because he
[27:50] knows where when when he has to face a
[27:53] child of
[27:55] God oh it ain't nothing easy brothers
[27:57] and
[27:58] sisters I'm a witness to that I am a
[28:02] witness to being
[28:03] criticized I think there's one out
[28:06] there I think there's someone out
[28:09] there that's been
[28:12] criticized we've open
[28:15] been but let us stand like
[28:19] Daniel having a
[28:22] certainty in his heart having a daily
[28:26] fellowship with his God
[28:29] and not caring what the critics had to
[28:32] say because he knew he know that
[28:35] Vengeance are his
[28:38] amen
[28:39] says vengeance are
[28:42] his and I believe Daniel knew
[28:45] that he didn't have to do a big
[28:48] show he knew what he was
[28:52] facing but I want to be more like Daniel
[28:55] tonight face the the enemy head
[29:00] on with certainty inside your
[29:03] heart knowing that you're God's backing
[29:06] you
[29:07] up because we got to believe that
[29:10] guys we have a God that if you stand for
[29:15] him he'll stand for
[29:17] you it's not
[29:20] complicated the scripture says he knows
[29:22] the desires of your heart he knows the
[29:25] desires of your heart
[29:28] he knows you want to do good the
[29:31] scripture says when I want to do
[29:34] good evil is present
[29:37] right but he knows that we're going to
[29:39] be judged we're going to be
[29:42] cried but he knows
[29:45] also that he would never forsake us he
[29:48] will never leave us
[29:50] alone when it seems like
[29:55] it's you're never alone brother
[29:58] I am a witness to
[30:00] that that's why I'm talking the way I'm
[30:02] talking right
[30:04] now I'm not talking something I don't
[30:07] know
[30:09] about I've been there I've been there
[30:12] when you're on the spot
[30:15] like trying to do
[30:18] right but then someone or a little
[30:23] voice and and it's sad to say this
[30:28] but sometimes amongst our own
[30:31] youth are those
[30:34] voices criticizing one
[30:36] another bringing one another
[30:40] down when we
[30:42] shouldn't why should we be
[30:45] embarrassed about talking about our
[30:49] God in a youth
[30:53] Gathering explodes my
[30:56] mind when we want to when someone wants
[30:58] to talk about
[31:00] God oh but someone
[31:02] else is turned
[31:05] off I don't want to talk about that
[31:07] right now we're not in church right
[31:10] now you're just trying to be another
[31:14] fanatic you're just trying to build up
[31:17] to some
[31:20] emotion but let us be like
[31:23] Daniel not caring what they got to say
[31:25] about us
[31:28] siling the voices
[31:30] outside and listening to the voice
[31:34] inside that keeps on saying keep
[31:37] going don't stop I'm here with you I see
[31:42] you
[31:43] son I see you
[31:45] daughter I know you're
[31:48] trying I know what age you're living
[31:52] at I know it's hard to come out of
[31:56] Le
[31:58] but I'm here with
[31:59] you in the midst of the
[32:02] fire I'm there with
[32:06] you come on
[32:08] Brothers brother Bron says if you come
[32:13] expecting you're going to get what you
[32:15] receive it
[32:17] right I'm not trying to be a fanatic I'm
[32:20] not trying to build up to
[32:22] anything our Pastor said it this last
[32:25] service on Wednesday
[32:28] I took that the heart I don't know about
[32:32] you we're sick and tired of
[32:35] word we need the
[32:37] gospel and I'm trying to do that the
[32:40] best I
[32:42] can yes we're going to
[32:44] fail yes we're going to mess
[32:47] up but that doesn't mean we have to
[32:50] stop that's what the devil wants you to
[32:52] do that's what the devil wants you to
[32:56] do he knows if he could stop God's
[33:01] plan in your
[33:03] life he know he can overcome anything
[33:07] else he can take over anything
[33:11] else but let's put a stop to that
[33:15] tonight
[33:17] devil shut up shut up shut your stinking
[33:22] mouth
[33:24] tonight he's talking to you right now
[33:28] brother Gustavo is just an
[33:31] emotion this ain't no different from any
[33:33] other Friday
[33:35] night all right okay God bless
[33:39] you I hope everything goes well for you
[33:41] after
[33:43] this but I think there's people here
[33:47] tonight there's youth
[33:49] tonight that came wanting
[33:54] something they they want something real
[33:58] do you guys want something
[34:00] real I really want
[34:02] it I I don't know about you I don't want
[34:04] to go 25
[34:07] years wasted of my
[34:10] life sitting on just a nice
[34:15] Pew nice
[34:17] Church what's the point of all of
[34:21] this if the
[34:24] torch if if the torch burns out with us
[34:27] the Next
[34:29] Generation I remember what brother calb
[34:31] said that service on
[34:33] Sunday who's going to be the face of
[34:36] this
[34:37] generation who's going to be the gener
[34:40] face of that
[34:42] generation are you going to be a
[34:44] bystandard are you going to be a
[34:49] bystandard yes someone just
[34:53] criticizing criticizing those that want
[34:55] to make it
[34:58] hindering those that want to
[35:01] try we should be encouraging one
[35:05] another one
[35:07] another not
[35:11] stomping amen it's very
[35:14] simple but we all have to go
[35:17] through through all of that I'm going
[35:20] read this quote from our
[35:23] prophets and it's majority of what I I
[35:25] thought I was going to bring
[35:29] but he says in the message show us the
[35:31] father and it'll satisfy
[35:37] us brother's talking about a
[35:42] picture photo I think it's the picture
[35:44] of the painting without the door knob
[35:46] right
[35:54] bro and brother Bar says every famous
[35:56] pict picture must first go through the
[35:58] Hall of
[36:04] critics oh my before it can be hung in a
[36:08] Hall of
[36:12] Fame and he says and I tell
[36:16] you he's telling me and
[36:19] you that's what the church has done
[36:24] today it went through the
[36:28] critics we are going through our critics

[36:49] Hall of Fame out
[36:53] here just sure as the world
[36:58] I'm going jump ahead and he says that's
[37:00] the same church is going to be caught up
[37:02] one of these
[37:07] mornings Daniel went through the Hall of
[37:13] critics Jesus Christ was also
[37:16] criticized in the in the pool of
[37:21] Betha Daniel was also criticized for
[37:24] wanting to take on a giant
[37:28] Moses was criticized for marrying an
[37:30] Ethiopian
[37:34] woman you and I are are nothing EXC
[37:37] we're not an
[37:40] excuse we're our
[37:44] targets but it's up to
[37:47] us and I'm going to close with
[37:50] this there's there's there's no
[37:53] perfect outside of God there's always
[37:59] struggle but it depends on who on you

[38:15] God I want to fight next to my
[38:19] God Amen God bless

[38:35] the you can accomp me to Daniel
[38:43] 620 bad criticism and positive
[38:46] criticism bad criticism is a
[38:50] demon Daniel 6 verse
[38:55] 20
[39:06] Le and he came to the den and he cried
[39:08] with a lament a lamentable voice to
[39:11] Daniel and the King spake and Daniel and
[39:13] said to Daniel oh Daniel servant of the
[39:15] Living God is thy God whom thou servest
[39:17] continually able to deliver thee from
[39:18] the Lions
[39:22] Daniel then Daniel said unto the king oh
[39:26] King live
[39:38] Forever by God hath sent his Angel and
[39:40] hath shut the Lion's mouths they have
[39:42] they have not hurt me for as much as
[39:44] before him in since he has found in me
[39:47] and also before thee Oh King I have done
[39:49] no
[39:55] hurt
[40:02] then was the king exceedingly glad for
[40:04] him and commanded that they should take
[40:05] Daniel out of the den So Daniel was
[40:07] taken out of the den and no manner of
[40:09] hurt was found upon him because he
[40:10] believed in his
[40:13] God Deuteronomy 31
[40:25] ver6
[40:27] be strong and of good courage fear not
[40:29] nor be afraid of them for the Lord thy
[40:31] God he is that that doth go with thee he
[40:34] will not fail thee nor forsake
[40:38] thee and that's what we can see in the
[40:40] story of
[40:41] Daniel God never left him God was always
[40:44] with
[40:46] him from the beginning when he was in
[40:49] Babylon when they cast him into the den
[40:52] of the
[40:53] Lions it all started with a lie
[40:57] that's why criticism is a
[40:59] demon a demon doesn't come by
[41:05] himself our brother Gustavo read chapter
[41:08] 6 Daniel chapter 6 verse
[41:12] 7 and it says there all the governors
[41:14] were in
[41:17] agreement but Daniel was not and he was
[41:19] the
[41:22] Mainer so that's how the king fell in
[41:25] the Trap
[41:29] we're talking about silencing the
[41:33] critic but for that to
[41:40] happen you have to have biblical
[41:42] principles and keep with the word of God
[41:44] it's all a
[41:47] process maybe you youth that look like
[41:50] to look into the
[41:55] Bible you may say Daniel was not a young
[41:57] man when he was cast into the lions
[41:59] den maybe he was about 70 years
[42:04] old but his PR his biblical principles
[42:07] was from he was his
[42:11] youth before he was a captive to
[42:16] Babylon perhaps his father took on
[42:19] Fridays to bible
[42:24] study on Fridays to youth
[42:28] you perhaps on Sunday
[42:32] twice and Daniel likeed to search into
[42:35] the
[42:36] scripture he knew what they were talking
[42:40] about perhaps his father did a a service
[42:43] in his
[42:45] home and Daniel received it with
[42:49] all because a Son of God should search
[42:51] the Scriptures
[42:52] Daily to not be
[42:55] deceived
[42:59] perhaps when Daniel came into
[43:02] Babylon you remember Jeremiah's
[43:07] prophecies and Jeremiah would
[43:10] say that they would be
[43:13] captives but the Liberation would come
[43:15] the Deliverance it would
[43:20] come I would like to read Genesis 22:1
[43:25] 17
[43:40] that in blessing I Will Bless thee and
[43:41] in multiplying I will multiply thy seed
[43:44] as the stairs stars of heaven and as the
[43:46] sand which is upon the seash shore and
[43:47] thy seed shall possess the Gate of his
[43:49] enemies and in thy seed shall all the
[43:51] nations of the earth be blessed because
[43:53] thou Hast obeyed my voice
[43:56] so in a moment in his
[43:58] life Daniel at a in a scripture
[44:02] study was looking at the
[44:05] scripture so that fortified
[44:08] him and his faith began to
[44:12] grow why because he had
[44:15] faith if we can study
[44:18] well Daniel could have gone to the per
[44:20] the statue of perect
[44:23] man but he had a disadvantage you you do
[44:25] not
[44:28] you have a great Advantage
[44:30] here because Daniel was in a different
[44:34] age he was not given the Holy
[44:36] Spirit you
[44:40] tonight you can receive the Holy Spirit
[44:42] if you do know
[44:43] how it's an advantage to strengthen your
[44:47] spirit anything that come against
[44:51] you it may not Prevail
[44:54] right
[44:59] the power of the de devil preached in
[45:16] 1955 I love him and I want you to love
[45:18] him I want you to believe him perfect
[45:20] love cast cast out all fear if you love
[45:23] him with the right kind of heart you
[45:24] won't have one Speck of fear whether to
[45:26] keep his word or
[45:54] not
[45:58] night after night standing in the
[45:59] platform before the gross thousands of
[46:00] people around this world critics sitting
[46:02] there saying is that it's this that and
[46:05] the other which doctors sitting there
[46:07] trying to throw spells on you challenge
[46:09] you to duels and things like that never
[46:11] one time I say by the grace of God has
[46:13] one Speck of fear ever hit my heart not
[46:15] one time why he said that he would take
[46:17] care of me and I believe him that's why
[46:19] if I'd be scared I'd
[46:24] run
[46:47] amen but I tell you when Jesus Christ
[46:49] anoints you you're not made with the
[46:50] same running material that's all not the
[46:52] rock of gilbar but the Rock of Ages you
[46:55] climb on the rock of Ages that's God's
[46:56] word and take your position there and
[46:58] stand while the gates of hell is Belling
[47:00] against it and with his perfect
[47:02] assurance that he who promised it not
[47:04] fail will never fail
[47:06] amen that's
[47:10] fa that's when you're not
[47:13] scared from the beginning Daniel had
[47:17] Faith he believed in the
[47:19] prophecies he believed in the word of
[47:22] God God believed he was Abraham's seed
[47:28] why because the seed of serpent is not
[47:30] nothing
[47:31] new the Jews knew the
[47:35] super but when Jesus Christ went to the
[47:38] Pharisees they told
[47:41] him we're sons of
[47:44] Abraham we're not sons of
[47:48] fornication so they had knowledge of the
[47:50] serpent
[47:51] seed it's nothing
[47:54] new
[47:56] it's just restoring the word that was
[47:59] there
[48:05] Genesis Genesis
[48:21] 2278 that in blessing I Will Bless thee
[48:24] and in multiplying I will multiply thy
[48:25] seed as the stars of heaven and that the
[48:27] sand which which is upon the seashore in
[48:29] thy seed shall possess the gates of his
[48:31] enemies and in thy seed shall all the
[48:33] nations of the earth be blessed because
[48:35] thou Hast obeyed my
[48:40] voice thy seed shall possess the Gate of
[48:42] his enemies preaching
[48:54] 59
[49:18] Danel a SE of Abraham was thrown into a
[49:20] fire furnace or no to a lion Zen pardon
[49:22] me Daniel was thrown into a lion Z to be
[49:24] killed by the and the angel of the Lord
[49:26] came that night and stopped the line no
[49:28] doubt it was that great Pillar of Fire
[49:30] that allowed the children of Israel an
[49:32] animal an animal is scared of the light
[49:34] and when the big light stood there the
[49:35] lion laid down and Daniel possessed the
[49:37] Gate of his enemy closed the mouth of
[49:38] the lion because he had God's promise
[49:40] and he was Abraham
[49:51] seed the Hebrew children when they was
[49:54] thrown into a fire furnace they they
[49:55] possessed the gates of the furnace and
[49:57] the Son of God came down and took the
[49:59] fire off of them and they possessed the
[50:01] gates of their
[50:03] enemy and not only did he shut the
[50:05] lion's
[50:06] mouth he shut the mouth of his enemies
[50:10] because he trusted in
[50:11] God he had faith in
[50:15] God he stood for the
[50:20] word but for that to
[50:23] happen when the problem comes to you
[50:26] when the critic criticism comes to
[50:29] you it's important to have what what
[50:32] type of attitude you
[50:34] have what attitude will you have what
[50:37] will you do
[50:40] why because if you take a wrong
[50:43] attitude God cannot support
[50:46] you so
[50:48] Daniel he had a good
[50:54] attitude
[50:57] Fellowship preaching
[51:00] 55 we're going to see what a good
[51:02] attitude
[51:04] is because Daniel
[51:06] SED SED it since he was a young
[51:10] man the word
[51:23] is the word is a seed but the seed won't
[51:25] grow unless you it is placed in the
[51:27] right kind of ground no matter how much
[51:29] seed you got if you're afraid to sew it
[51:31] the seed will do you no
[51:48] good but listen to this every word of
[51:50] God is a seed Jesus said so and every
[51:52] promise of God will come to the pass
[51:54] will come to pass if if you will receive
[51:55] it and don't doubt it can place it in
[51:57] your heart and believe it came from God
[51:59] and water it with faith it will Spring
[52:02] forth of its
[52:22] kind don't ever forget the statement I
[52:24] make this from my heart the right mental
[52:26] attitude towards any promise of God will
[52:28] bring it to pass do you believe that if
[52:30] you'll take the right attitude and
[52:32] that's it's God's word and God is behind
[52:34] his word and the word is God it'll bring
[52:35] to pass what it
[52:48] says if you plant wheat you will get
[52:50] wheat if you plant corn you get if you
[52:52] plant corn you will get corn if you want
[52:54] to be saved accept his Plan of Salvation
[52:56] if you want to be healed accept his plan
[52:58] of healing there there they
[53:13] areu he Christ was wounded for our
[53:16] transgressions and his stripes were we
[53:19] were healed that's all you have to know
[53:21] the next thing you have to believe it
[53:22] it'll take care of itself all of you H
[53:25] Allelujah it
[53:27] will now the attitude of
[53:29] Daniel Every problem that presented
[53:32] itself to himself to
[53:35] him he took it with the right
[53:38] attitude why because he kept the word of
[53:41] God when these critics came to
[53:44] him and deceived the
[53:47] king he simply kept the word of
[53:49] God he didn't have to do anything
[53:53] else all you had to do is believe
[53:56] keep the word of
[53:58] God why because God takes care of the
[54:01] rest you don't have to do
[54:04] anymore young man if someone comes to
[54:06] you with a
[54:08] criticism what will you
[54:10] do what attitude will you
[54:14] have where you have the attitude of the
[54:16] Lord Jesus
[54:17] Christ
[54:20] why they spit on him they did everything
[54:23] to him
[54:26] and the word of God says he did not open
[54:27] his mouth he did not
[54:30] complain he took the right
[54:32] attitude if you and this night take the
[54:34] right
[54:36] attitude every problem that comes to
[54:39] you any criticism that
[54:43] comes God will take care of the
[54:46] rest as long as you keep with the word
[54:49] of
[54:50] God don't
[54:52] move stay going straight
[54:57] uh one night when we were at the other
[55:00] building or other the
[55:01] church a young man came to
[55:05] me said brother
[55:09] uh I would like to talk to
[55:12] you I said that's all right tell
[55:17] me he said one time me and the
[55:20] [Music]
[55:22] youth firstly I would like to ask for
[55:24] for
[55:28] foress I spoke some things about
[55:35] you because sometimes you are very
[55:38] exceedingly in in the
[55:40] order he's my brother and my
[55:43] friend God bless his
[55:45] heart for the
[55:48] honesty and I told
[55:51] him there's no problem
[55:54] brother
[55:56] everything's going to be
[55:59] okay but apart from
[56:01] that what I
[56:03] did is check
[56:08] myself to see if what he was saying was
[56:12] true why because there's good
[56:15] criticism and there's bad
[56:18] criticism you have to
[56:20] discern what type of
[56:22] criticism is coming towards you
[56:27] why because if it's constructive
[56:31] criticism that will bless
[56:33] you it will lift you up
[56:39] why because when God puts you in a
[56:42] problem be of criticism or something
[56:46] else and something come someone comes
[56:48] against
[56:50] you you need to have the right
[56:53] attitude because Danel you
[56:56] knew that God had
[56:58] permitted had allowed everything that
[57:00] had been happening to
[57:03] him and not to hurt
[57:05] him it was for him to rise higher to get
[57:09] another step
[57:11] higher for the attitude that he
[57:15] had would make him grow
[57:18] spiritually it depends how you take
[57:22] things despite being a good ISM check
[57:27] yourself if it's a bad
[57:29] criticism stay
[57:31] still stay with the word of
[57:33] God it's another step grow
[57:37] more you won't see it another way God
[57:40] bless
[57:42] [Applause]
[57:46] you God bless the brothers
[57:50] amen uh you know I heard uh I was doing
[57:54] some studying
[57:55] and
[57:57] uh there was uh something I read that I
[58:00] really
[58:02] liked it said uh you know if if a
[58:05] criticism had any
[58:09] power then uh skunks would be
[58:13] extinct you know because they they get
[58:17] criticized all the
[58:18] time hey man did did did you guys catch
[58:21] that or was it just sorry uh it said if
[58:24] if criticism had any
[58:28] power then skunks would be
[58:32] extinct they they would cease to exist
[58:34] they would no longer
[58:38] exist so so uh that's uh you know and I
[58:42] believe that
[58:44] 100% you know that uh
[58:47] criticism only has the power that that
[58:50] that you give
[58:53] it amen amen uh and uh you know that's
[58:57] just uh that's just one of the things
[58:59] that's inevitable in in in in
[59:03] life it it's something that that we have
[59:06] to go through you know throughout our
[59:09] lives you know the world's going to
[59:11] criticize
[59:13] you you know and even sometimes you get
[59:15] criticized in
[59:17] church amen amen uh you know when uh
[59:20] Daniel was in you know in in this
[59:22] Kingdom they put him as one of the the
[59:24] president
[59:28] you know he was he was one of the ones
[59:30] in
[59:31] charge but even within that
[59:35] Kingdom uh you know there was uh there
[59:38] there was
[59:40] haters you know as a youth
[59:43] service you know and you know there's a
[59:45] lot of haters out
[59:47] there you know they just they just like
[59:50] they like to criticize
[59:52] amen uh you know and and uh you know
[59:54] know sometimes you know they it's like I
[59:56] was telling brother
[59:59] Gustavo sometimes you know they they're
[1:00:01] they're rooting right there with
[1:00:04] you they're just you know support
[1:00:08] you come on brother you got
[1:00:10] this and they'll support you as long as
[1:00:13] you're not doing better than they
[1:00:17] are you know as long as you're as long
[1:00:19] as you're not doing better than them
[1:00:21] then they support
[1:00:23] you
[1:00:25] as long as you don't sing better than
[1:00:28] them as long as you don't play the drums
[1:00:30] better than
[1:00:32] them you know as long as you're not
[1:00:34] doing something better than
[1:00:37] them then then they're on your
[1:00:40] team but as soon as you start you know
[1:00:42] standing out a little
[1:00:43] [Music]
[1:00:45] bit then all of that begins to change
[1:00:48] amen it it's it's the truth
[1:00:51] Brothers you know I remember uh you know
[1:00:53] one of the first uh when I first came to
[1:00:56] church uh you know I didn't I didn't
[1:00:58] quite look like
[1:01:00] this uh you know I was uh I remember
[1:01:03] going you know in some uh baggy baggy
[1:01:07] jeans you know I might had some earrings
[1:01:10] I don't
[1:01:12] remember uh but you know I'm just I just
[1:01:15] thank
[1:01:17] God that there wasn't anybody there that
[1:01:19] criticized
[1:01:22] me for for going to church the way I
[1:01:26] did uh because I believe that if they
[1:01:28] would have criticized me at that
[1:01:31] moment I don't think I'd be standing
[1:01:32] here before
[1:01:34] you because uh you know as a young
[1:01:38] man as a young
[1:01:41] lady oh you know that's one of the
[1:01:43] things that probably hurts the
[1:01:46] most it it it hurts you know I see some
[1:01:49] of the
[1:01:50] youth you know some of you walk with
[1:01:53] walk in here with a heavy heart
[1:01:57] do you know maybe you got
[1:02:00] criticized maybe you got criticized the
[1:02:03] home know because I because I'm going to
[1:02:06] be honest with
[1:02:07] you you know even as parents
[1:02:10] sometimes we have a critical
[1:02:14] spirit you know and instead of
[1:02:15] supporting our
[1:02:17] youth being
[1:02:20] happy that they're just even sitting
[1:02:22] here at
[1:02:23] church
[1:02:26] all you do is smash
[1:02:29] them just put them
[1:02:31] down in all reality you should be
[1:02:33] thankful to
[1:02:35] God you should be thankful to God that
[1:02:38] they're still
[1:02:39] here they could be out there in the
[1:02:41] world doing
[1:02:43] drugs or they could be out there doing
[1:02:45] things with their
[1:02:47] friends they could be
[1:02:49] stealing they could be anywhere
[1:02:52] else by the grace of
[1:02:55] God but they're still
[1:02:58] here amen
[1:03:00] amen we should be encouraging
[1:03:03] them you know I I I remember growing
[1:03:08] up I felt like I got smashed my whole
[1:03:12] life and you know it was just upset
[1:03:15] me and we wonder why they're not
[1:03:20] inspired because they haven't heard the
[1:03:22] inspired word
[1:03:25] all they've heard is
[1:03:27] negativity and you know and you use the
[1:03:31] word but you use it to condemn
[1:03:34] them and you tell them how ashamed you
[1:03:36] are of
[1:03:38] them and you know what is that supposed
[1:03:41] to do to
[1:03:43] somebody what is it supposed to
[1:03:51] do it definitely doesn't make you want
[1:03:53] to do more
[1:03:58] you want to do
[1:04:00] less you know there was sometimes people
[1:04:03] that I thought was real close to
[1:04:07] me now you know when I was
[1:04:10] younger and uh you know I thought that
[1:04:12] they were supposed to encourage me
[1:04:13] through
[1:04:17] life but all they did they did the exact
[1:04:21] opposite they just put me down
[1:04:25] you know and and and you just you just
[1:04:27] get tired of
[1:04:28] it but you know the devil the devil's
[1:04:31] real good at
[1:04:33] this you see the devil doesn't take
[1:04:35] Small Things lightly
[1:04:36] [Music]
[1:04:39] amen you see the devil
[1:04:42] knows that in the infancy of
[1:04:46] something that's the easiest time to
[1:04:48] kill
[1:04:50] it but when Jesus came to the Earth
[1:04:55] but when Moses came to the
[1:04:57] Earth there was a
[1:05:00] persecution and you know the reason
[1:05:03] was because he had
[1:05:06] heard he he had heard that that somebody
[1:05:09] that that was a king
[1:05:12] around there was a king that was
[1:05:16] coming and you know he wanted to make
[1:05:19] sure that he killed
[1:05:21] it before it grew and I believe the
[1:05:25] devil doesn't change his
[1:05:27] strategy he's trying to kill the
[1:05:30] youth he's trying to kill them with
[1:05:33] criticism as long as they as long as
[1:05:35] they're
[1:05:37] young because he knows the potential
[1:05:40] that that's
[1:05:42] there and if they can get through that
[1:05:46] stage that he has something coming to
[1:05:50] him if if the Youth of voice the true
[1:05:53] Tabernacle
[1:05:55] I could overcome the
[1:05:58] criticism the devil has a force to be
[1:06:01] reckoned
[1:06:03] with he's got something coming to
[1:06:08] him and it's not just one person I
[1:06:11] believe I don't believe it's just
[1:06:15] brotherto I don't believe it's just the
[1:06:17] ministers up
[1:06:19] here but we all have some sort of
[1:06:23] potential amen
[1:06:27] amen I believe that when uh
[1:06:34] Daniel when Daniel was amongst those
[1:06:38] people you know amongst amongst the the
[1:06:40] the the leaders of that
[1:06:45] Kingdom he uh he was well
[1:06:49] aware of where he
[1:06:52] stood amen amen you know this Book of
[1:06:55] Daniel he this chapter he doesn't talk
[1:06:57] very
[1:07:00] much you know when you get
[1:07:04] criticized and you hear about
[1:07:07] it you know you're out for
[1:07:10] blood you know that that that's just the
[1:07:13] way the human being
[1:07:14] is you're like oh
[1:07:17] yeah he's going to get
[1:07:19] it and you and all of a sudden you have
[1:07:22] a great memory
[1:07:26] you're like I got some dirt on
[1:07:28] him you know I I know what you
[1:07:31] did you know and you just you just want
[1:07:34] to get right back at
[1:07:37] them amen amen but but you
[1:07:41] notice that a spirit filled
[1:07:45] man he don't go by his
[1:07:49] feelings he he don't go by those
[1:07:52] things because he knows where he's
[1:07:53] [Music]
[1:07:56] standing Daniel didn't say a
[1:07:59] word he he had already
[1:08:02] won before the trial
[1:08:05] came Daniel had already
[1:08:08] overcame because not only did he open
[1:08:11] those
[1:08:13] curtains but he opened his
[1:08:15] heart he opened his heart to
[1:08:19] God there wasn't nobody that was going
[1:08:21] to stop
[1:08:22] him he was on his
[1:08:26] way amen
[1:08:29] Amen brother bham says
[1:08:36] this he says one thing's
[1:08:40] sure that's God's
[1:08:43] word that's God's word that God's word
[1:08:46] will never
[1:08:47] fail no matter how critical critics
[1:08:50] might criticize
[1:08:52] it it says how education might explain
[1:08:55] it
[1:08:59] away how they might do this that or the
[1:09:03] other but it won't stop it one
[1:09:07] bit it'll happen just the
[1:09:10] same as John said God's able the stones
[1:09:13] toise children to
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:17] Abraham God's going to do it his words
[1:09:20] are going to be fulfilled in their
[1:09:22] season
[1:09:24] and nothing's going to stop
[1:09:27] it I'm so glad of
[1:09:30] that oh how glad I
[1:09:33] am you see if you're a true son or
[1:09:35] daughter of
[1:09:37] God see you got something in
[1:09:40] you that don't matter what they say
[1:09:42] about
[1:09:43] you it doesn't even matter who said
[1:09:46] it if God didn't say
[1:09:49] it then it doesn't
[1:09:52] matter amen amen I don't I don't care
[1:09:55] who it
[1:09:56] was because sometimes even as parents we
[1:09:58] say the wrong
[1:10:01] things that's why it's so important to
[1:10:03] have the inspired
[1:10:06] word the inspired word of
[1:10:10] God this is not the word of
[1:10:13] man but this is the word of
[1:10:16] God know we come here and we preach the
[1:10:21] gospel that's what we preach here
[1:10:24] we preach the Gospel of Jesus
[1:10:26] Christ amen and you know but sometimes I
[1:10:31] wonder what gospel we we're listening
[1:10:35] to because if you're listening to the
[1:10:37] right
[1:10:39] gospel it will produce the life of
[1:10:43] Jesus but you know sometimes we like to
[1:10:46] hear the gospel of
[1:10:49] Satan you know what his gospel
[1:10:52] is you know it's a p
[1:10:56] pluma you know it's it's all these
[1:11:00] rappers all this
[1:11:03] garbage and that's what brings you
[1:11:07] down that's what makes you not want to
[1:11:11] walk come on youth I don't act like you
[1:11:14] know you don't know who he
[1:11:17] is you know who he
[1:11:19] is you should know who Jesus
[1:11:22] is that's who you should
[1:11:26] know that that gospel ain't going to do
[1:11:28] a thing for
[1:11:30] you but it seems like that's what we
[1:11:33] listen to the
[1:11:35] most we hear more than than than the
[1:11:38] than the preachings of brother
[1:11:41] brandom amen
[1:11:43] amen we hear it so
[1:11:47] often because we think we're in
[1:11:51] love we think you know that we're just
[1:11:53] it's a big
[1:11:56] shot now you know that you're something
[1:11:59] big but you know the devil knows where
[1:12:01] to play this
[1:12:05] gospel you know he was he was uh his his
[1:12:08] his gospel was was was the music in
[1:12:10] heaven
[1:12:12] amen that's how that's how he wins the
[1:12:14] youth
[1:12:17] over think you know the youth you
[1:12:20] know I was watching them one time you
[1:12:23] know there was some music going it was
[1:12:25] Christian
[1:12:27] music but they get a little beat
[1:12:31] going and you know and all of a sudden I
[1:12:33] started looking
[1:12:35] down and I saw about 10 or 15 you know
[1:12:38] their feet just start
[1:12:42] moving because they you know just the
[1:12:44] flesh likes that
[1:12:47] man you know if you're going to
[1:12:50] dance oh you know you better make sure
[1:12:52] you dance in the spirit
[1:12:54] amen better make sure you're dancing for
[1:12:56] Jesus
[1:12:58] amen that's what we
[1:13:01] need amen
[1:13:03] amen you know I'm closing
[1:13:09] now Daniel didn't talk a whole
[1:13:12] lot because he didn't have
[1:13:15] to you see when when God
[1:13:20] speaks when God tells a son or daughter
[1:13:23] of God to
[1:13:26] speak it's not going to be vain
[1:13:31] words when God speaks the
[1:13:35] word you better believe it does
[1:13:39] something it it'll do something to your
[1:13:42] heart you see It'll it not only it'll
[1:13:45] just go straight into the depths of your
[1:13:49] soul and when his sons or daughters
[1:13:52] speak
[1:13:55] it should produce the same
[1:13:58] thing you know Proverbs 18:21 says
[1:14:03] this it says death and
[1:14:06] life are in the power of the
[1:14:09] tongue and they that love it shall eat
[1:14:11] the fruit
[1:14:13] thereof what are we
[1:14:16] speaking what are we talking
[1:14:19] about what are we doing in the
[1:14:22] fellowship
[1:14:23] you see the only time Daniel
[1:14:27] talked in the whole
[1:14:30] chapter he talked to
[1:14:33] testify that that's what he did that's
[1:14:37] that's all he
[1:14:38] did I want to read what he
[1:14:42] said because I believe it's the inspired
[1:14:45] word
[1:14:46] amen he says this in Daniel
[1:14:50] 6:21 he says then said Daniel unto the
[1:14:53] king
[1:14:55] oh King live
[1:14:57] forever my God has sent his
[1:15:01] Angel and has shut the lion's
[1:15:04] mouth that they have not hurt
[1:15:07] me for as much as before
[1:15:10] him innocence he was found in me and
[1:15:14] also before
[1:15:16] thee
[1:15:17] King have I done no
[1:15:21] hurts you see God stood for
[1:15:24] him he was
[1:15:27] testifying that's what we should be
[1:15:30] doing you're going to say
[1:15:32] something testify about your
[1:15:35] God testify about what he's
[1:15:39] done and
[1:15:41] confess about what he's going to
[1:15:44] do because he's not
[1:15:46] done it's just
[1:15:52] beginning
[1:15:54] you know
[1:15:57] uh when he was in that
[1:16:05] Den I'm sure all the
[1:16:08] critics and the people that accused him
[1:16:10] were
[1:16:17] laughing they're like man he's he's dead
[1:16:22] meat
[1:16:29] that's
[1:16:32] right he's going to be a a Lon cocktail
[1:16:34] that's right he's
[1:16:38] done they probably bought their new
[1:16:42] suit they're ready to get
[1:16:50] promoted but
[1:16:52] Daniel
[1:16:54] Daniel had
[1:16:56] prayed Daniel knew who his God
[1:16:59] was he knew where he
[1:17:02] stood said God if this is if this is
[1:17:05] what you
[1:17:08] want this is where I'll
[1:17:12] be I'll be
[1:17:14] here because I believe that you put me
[1:17:17] you allowed this to
[1:17:20] happen you allowed this to happen to me
[1:17:25] and I'm
[1:17:26] here because I
[1:17:28] know that you're able to deliver
[1:17:34] me and the guys put their suit
[1:17:38] on and they might have went with the
[1:17:42] King to see what was left of
[1:17:46] Daniel but when Daniel when they called
[1:17:49] for
[1:17:51] Daniel and they heard heard him
[1:17:55] speak they couldn't say a
[1:17:59] word everybody they had criticized
[1:18:03] him everybody that had laughed at
[1:18:06] him everybody that laughed at the God
[1:18:08] that he
[1:18:11] served they couldn't say
[1:18:13] anything see he not only shut the mouth
[1:18:16] of the
[1:18:18] lion but he shut the mouth of the
[1:18:21] critics shut the mouth of the
[1:18:26] people that had made fun of
[1:18:29] them that laughed him because he went to
[1:18:34] church because maybe he didn't have what
[1:18:36] the others
[1:18:41] had but when he came
[1:18:44] out when Daniel came out of the
[1:18:50] den God was magnified
[1:18:54] his
[1:18:55] influence that he
[1:18:57] had was
[1:19:00] greater when he came out of the
[1:19:04] den then when when he was going
[1:19:08] in and that's what the
[1:19:11] god that we
[1:19:13] serve can do for
[1:19:16] you he can do it for you young
[1:19:19] man he can do it for you young lady
[1:19:24] and even if he
[1:19:25] didn't and even if he
[1:19:28] didn't even if he did not do
[1:19:36] it I'd still rather go out
[1:19:42] swinging I'll go out swinging as hard as
[1:19:44] I
[1:19:45] could but knowing that I gave it my all
[1:19:49] knowing that I gave it my
[1:19:51] all everything I
[1:19:54] could I swung as hard as I
[1:19:57] could I did what I could
[1:20:00] Lord sometimes that's all you can
[1:20:04] do you could just give one more
[1:20:07] step maybe that step is here at the
[1:20:11] altar maybe that step is just take to
[1:20:14] ask somebody for
[1:20:17] forgiveness maybe that step is to make
[1:20:19] things
[1:20:21] right I wish your
[1:20:23] friend because maybe you've been on the
[1:20:25] criticizing
[1:20:29] end but all it takes is one
[1:20:32] step all it takes for you is to
[1:20:35] believe I believe that
[1:20:38] God I can and will
[1:20:42] deliver if he did it for
[1:20:44] Daniel he can do it for
[1:20:46] you I believe it that's the God that I
[1:20:51] serve that's the God that I live
[1:20:54] for and that's the God that I die
[1:20:58] for the altar is
[1:21:01] open God bless
[1:21:08] you amen I'm going to ask you to stand
