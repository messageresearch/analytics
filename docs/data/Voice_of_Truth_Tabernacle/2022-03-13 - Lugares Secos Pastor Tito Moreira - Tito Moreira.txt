[Music] oh [Music] faith [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] um 37 ezekiel chapter 37 we're going to continue with what our brother where our brother alex left off last week amen [Music] and as much as i wanted to deviate from here bringing me back to this scripture ezekiel 37 1 reads the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry they were very dry in other words god wanted him to see that they were very dry now please bow your head and we'll be praying our lord jesus christ your needs of our hearts lord what our soul is needing what our soul is crying for in this morning because if we're here because there's something in our souls that needs you lord may your holy ghost can go through any barrier of our mind of our feelings [Music] help us in this morning the people of israel are preparing to return to the promised land to return to israel return to jerusalem god is preparing for them god what because just was giving them the revival they needed first it says full of bones what happened with this great army these were the bones of the people of israel israel is the type of us because brother branham says the way god works with israel why did they end it how dry these bones were in my mind they like to walk on dry places so the devil will want the least i want is someone to receive me with a dry encouragement i believe barbershops a barber they need to not be a driver customer service is first because no one likes to speak with someone dry yes someone good morning [Music] used to yeah and we learned something one with another in such manner but that doesn't mean we like it [Music] yes brethren doesn't mean that they're full of angers doesn't mean that they're maybe full of sin it's simply a person that doesn't have emotions that doesn't come passionately that's why the lord jesus christ is in revelation did he say they say oh jalapu says demons walk on dry places they had to be in a dry place or i'll say it would have never dried up these bones were dead because they needed water that's right we're lacking water i'm gonna prove it to you matthew fives matthew five mateos matthew five verse one and on are they that you're born repeat lester day that mourn they shall be comforted i'll inherit the earth persecuted blessed are you when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all men are evil against you falsely rejoice are the ones who work mercy you haven't been here is the problem is the attacks problem no sauna aren't okay and they persecute you and the contrary you're contrary [Music] there's a soothing of heart tenderness or tenderness of heart your hearts embezzle you have the choice of pouring life on this wound tenderize instead of allowing their hearts so hard letting the problem turn into a problem take advantage of the opportunity tenders tenderizes us and not makes us harder dehydration that tenderness of heart isn't there no there's no humidity when it's dry there's no tears no repentance and we'll speak more on that later when it's dry there's no warmth there's no tenderness when it's is a place that turns dirty very quick very quick you need water to wash off to keep a clean place you need water a place that is everything is when the place is dry because nothing is growing and then it occurs in the body dehydration you need your you know your body needs water if there is one thing that your body needs the most is agua it's water water there's a way that your body cleanses almost all your organs need water because water carries out nutrients and washes away all the filters and begins to bring out [Music] because your organs aren't receiving what they need you feel a thirst your mouth dries out you know you do you notice when someone's dry no salad nothing good comes out of their mouth they come to church there's no worship no i know yes that's right that's right [Music] that thing feels one of the functions for water in our bodies that lubricates our eyes everything [Music] you begin to see dark places lord have mercy without [Music] is sprinkle clean water upon you he said he shall be clean from all your filthiness all your idols will i cleanse you notice the reason many times people are seeking idols because they're not satisfied from god look when jesus christ found the merchant when he met her at the well first thing he tells her if you knew who's speaking to you if you knew god's gift [Music] no one gave her oh where there's water there's not many places they know that animals won't get there and the snakes can survive one more time on the country they like heats snakes like foreign because they're cold-blooded and the heat warms them up but above all they come out in the heat because they made it when it's raining animals don't need to come out of their nests you don't need to leave their house there's forgiveness because oh [Music] god identified this woman's problem god said look the reason you're the way you are it's because you haven't drank of the water the right water the problems [Music] [Music] because there wasn't water in our lives and that for our brothers [Music] is i still love you brother amen is a new heart also will i give you i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh let me tell you you want to remove a stony heart give it mercy give it love give it forgiveness what happened with these people notice the problems what is killing us oh oh why because we're dry [Music] like if god owed us something part of the other thanksgiving for him everything that he's giving us once i should amen that's what god is saying their hearts hardened everything turns weary oh but it's everything seems difficult we don't worship how we used to sure i was telling the lord this morning lord worshipping even if i [Music] isaiah 44 1 says yet now here oh jacob my servant and israel whom i have chosen to and thus it's the lord that made thee and formed me from the womb which will help thee fear not o jacob my servant and thou jesurin whom i have chosen and they shall spring up as among the grass as well as waters that's what we need from the outside [Applause] is the water [Applause] they would be playing down at the cross on the piano you have to first be broken god help [Music] my says we have a dried eye repentance it's not real he says people are already in tears you still [Music] we're full i got that [Music] they come everything is oh my lights [Music] when the church used to call for a all nights prayer meeting and when the sermon went forth there wasn't a dry eye in this you begin to dry out the windows what's happening to your brother you are closing your heart when you say as long as i'm well conquered as long as i'm happy my family as long as my family is well you know what you're doing you're drying out you begin to dry out you don't care what's happening you've closed that foul that wants to float because the only way water can come in the quesadilla this water needs to come out that's the only way para fluid for uh [Music] and sooner or later we'll dry out brother [Music] they dried out [Music] that was israel that was a problem with these bones they dried out it's kind of dry [Music] god made them an army so work together [Music] [Music] you know what god keeps saying in this ver chapter 37 if you keep reading chapter 37 and after he speaks about the dry bones he speaks about unity [Music] i asked myself [Music] if that isn't many times what drives us [Music] that the rest don't matter [Music] [Music] can bring out [Music] it's drying out oh [Applause] [Music] you can help [Music] that [Music] the people of israel tried out please stand i don't know if there's anyone here [Applause] feeling dry the library the book of joel [Music] viola speaks to the people of israel about the return and restoration and tells them [Music] around the same time around ezekiel also responded [Music] with and i will no more make you a reproach among the heathens fear the choice for the lord shall do great things be not afraid of the old because we're [Music] for he god [Music] [Music] in the beginning just like in the beginning when they sold everything and helped each other shared everything they and the floor [Music] the locus is like a grasshopper but then it flies [Music] normally the palmer worm does itself on its own it stands on its own demons many times they do their own things but [Music] [Music] i'm tired of living a dry life i know many times but our lives shows it's time to say that forgive me lord forgive me [Music] it's not what the rest dude [Music] [Music] let's worship him [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Music] love [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music]
