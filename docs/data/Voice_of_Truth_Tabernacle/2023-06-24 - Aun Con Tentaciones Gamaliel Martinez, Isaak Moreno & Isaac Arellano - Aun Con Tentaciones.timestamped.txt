[26:54] [Music]
[26:59] chapter 4
[27:01] verse 1.
[27:08] days
[27:27] where did the wars and quarrels
[27:30] between you come from isn't it one of
[27:32] isn't it one of your passions with
[27:34] fighting your members you curve covet
[27:37] and you don't have you kill and burn
[27:39] with envy and you can't reach
[27:42] foreign
[28:30] [Music]
[28:40] Brothers
[28:44] Elementary
[29:18] [Music]
[29:22] and I put
[29:25] I put because I can I can relate this to
[29:27] me being
[29:28] and uh from those
[29:32] and I believe I can identify with some
[29:34] of the uses this evening
[29:37] because I asked myself those questions
[29:43] I was born in the message
[29:46] and I I titled it
[29:50] is
[29:52] does God really exist was one of my
[29:54] questions because the youth asked
[29:56] themselves that question a lot csrc if
[29:58] that's so uh
[30:00] then who is he where is he
[30:05] is God truly interested in my life
[30:14] because I've been through there
[30:23] I was born in the message
[30:26] those questions came to me
[30:31] those questions really bring doubt
[30:34] Elias Elijah
[30:37] it was a person
[30:44] he was a prophet that was fearful
[30:48] there
[31:07] I imagine youth get includes and I
[31:12] include myself
[31:12] that we've gone through some of those
[31:15] ideas
[31:17] there are days where we're on the highs
[31:20] ideas and their days where we're on the
[31:22] Lord
[31:24] because we're
[31:25] humanos we are humans
[31:29] we are we will have highs and lows
[31:32] and and and Beyond The Heights as well
[31:35] and Don says
[31:40] do we all have highs and lows questions
[32:39] so youth
[33:40] Elijah
[34:40] but if you make a mistake
[34:41] characteristics
[35:10] um
[35:11] foreign
[36:40] similar to hours
[36:47] the Lord
[37:07] foreign
[38:07] foreign
[38:19] okay get out man God really heal me so
[38:23] he says here and so the mentors
[38:27] of questions
[38:35] when his temper slipped out of his hands
[38:37] and he had amenities that went wrong
[38:58] it's his Holiness
[39:05] because
[39:11] I am in him
[39:14] and that's what makes it real
[39:18] we don't have to depend on ourselves
[39:20] right
[39:46] right
[39:53] I like what it says in James chapter
[39:55] five uh
[39:59] um
[40:28] that does not that does not mean that
[40:32] God doesn't love you that God can't use
[40:34] you
[40:35] that does that doesn't mean
[40:39] to express
[40:46] London
[40:48] here are his songs which come from the
[40:50] sick and Afflicted this faith that we
[40:52] have been talking about
[40:54] um
[40:55] let's jump a little bit here
[41:00] okay they say
[41:03] is
[41:10] he prayed firmly so that it wouldn't
[41:12] rain
[41:13] if we see what the prophet says here
[41:22] he prayed and it wouldn't rain
[41:25] do you know this use
[41:29] he used Elijah even then
[41:33] [Music]
[41:38] [Music]
[41:45] our heavenly father says the word
[41:48] that the prayer of the faith will save
[41:49] the sick and the Elijah's passage
[41:51] similar to ours
[41:53] so I will go quickly to this this is
[42:09] God allows us to never be guilty of
[42:11] making the gospel so complicated so that
[42:13] people can come to think that it is a
[42:15] matter of men but of God
[42:18] now here
[42:23] I repeat once again
[42:31] the church from where I came from in
[42:33] Mexico in Mexico
[42:36] I never saw this in the United States
[42:38] but in Mexico
[42:39] they were very legally
[42:42] I see I see I see and like this
[42:47] is
[42:58] I don't want to be guilty to you foreign
[43:47] simply remembering my youth
[43:49] yeah
[43:52] they told me
[43:54] I don't know how to play the drums if
[43:57] you don't have a suit
[43:59] they would tell me I couldn't play this
[44:01] is
[44:10] Worship the Lord
[44:12] [Music]
[44:15] and I'll leave this spot for
[44:20] the last verse of the Bible here
[44:24] foreign
[44:45] to destroy through death the one who had
[44:47] the Empire of death that is the devil
[44:56] [Music]
[45:00] for as soon as he is he himself
[45:07] Lord Jesus Christ is with us
[45:12] he was a young man as well
[45:17] I'll leave you with that God bless you
[45:24] amen God bless you brothers and sisters
[45:28] how many came expecting something from
[45:30] God amen
[45:33] amen amen he's great amen amen I just
[45:38] want to say hi to the brothers
[45:41] and give them thanks for the trip that
[45:45] we took last time
[45:46] didn't have a chance to say something
[45:50] I just wanted to say that before we
[45:53] start amen amen
[45:56] our Lord is great amen is
[46:01] contraceptive
[46:03] and then um if you could go with me
[46:08] to First Kings 18 21 uh
[46:13] Reyes
[46:15] First Kings 18 21.
[46:23] amen everyone looks great tonight amen
[46:29] amen First Kings 18 21.
[46:33] and Elijah came unto all the people and
[46:36] said how long how e between two opinions
[46:40] if the Lord be God follow him but if
[46:42] thou
[46:43] then follow him and the people answered
[46:46] him not a word
[46:59] is
[47:03] you see our brother um gamma red um the
[47:06] verse with um Elijah being having
[47:08] passions as us right
[47:14] and like he said even with Temptations
[47:16] amen
[47:18] and as a subtitle I put what are you
[47:21] passionate about
[47:24] you see we see the people from measure
[47:26] at this time
[47:27] they had passions for the wrong things
[47:31] correct they had passion for everything
[47:33] except the truth
[47:36] you see we see that the nation
[47:40] um they didn't know if it was better to
[47:42] worship
[47:47] you see they knew Jehovah
[47:50] but they weren't passionate for him
[47:52] they have the truth amen you see we see
[47:56] Elijah came
[47:57] to bring the truth
[48:00] we see we see that gamma was talking a
[48:03] little bit about um
[48:06] you know Temptations and being
[48:09] passionate for the wrong things
[48:11] a little bit of the things that Elijah
[48:13] had
[48:14] you know he was depressed he was a man
[48:18] like us amen but I would like to speak a
[48:21] little bit about
[48:23] his passion but towards God Amen
[48:26] I want to bring it the other way around
[48:28] amen
[48:29] you see we see he had passion for God
[48:32] you see even with his mistakes and him
[48:35] and The Temptations
[48:38] he still had the passion he still prayed
[48:42] amen he still stopped the rain for three
[48:44] years and six months
[48:48] well he didn't do it but through his
[48:50] prayers
[48:52] amen and we see the most
[48:55] a man like him to come down to earth
[48:59] had to have passion to speak to so many
[49:02] people amen
[49:04] you see
[49:06] um
[49:07] what are you passionate for tonight amen
[49:10] what are your passions tonight amen what
[49:14] are your passions
[49:15] you see I can relate this a lot to you
[49:20] my passions
[49:22] uh one of my passions that I that I was
[49:25] really big ones
[49:28] with soccer amen
[49:31] amen I love to watch it
[49:34] I love to play it and if we read the the
[49:39] definition of passion
[49:43] it says strong and barely controllable
[49:46] emotions
[49:49] see when someone has passion for
[49:51] something
[49:52] it's almost to the point where you can't
[49:55] control it
[49:57] it's almost to the point where you have
[49:59] that itch amen
[50:02] and it could either be bad yeah
[50:25] he gave them the first option
[50:28] to show how great their God was amen
[50:33] you see he told them okay I'll let you
[50:36] see if fear God is the true God
[50:40] and they made their altars amen
[50:43] as we know
[50:45] and you know I believe they had the
[50:48] passion
[50:50] 450 prophets try to prove them wrong
[50:52] amen
[50:56] they had the passion so much
[50:59] to the point where they started to cut
[51:01] themselves
[51:03] and we see
[51:05] that Elijah Elias he started kind of
[51:08] making a little fun of them
[51:11] he was like where's your God
[51:13] he's like he might be sleeping
[51:16] he probably took a trip somewhere
[51:20] he says cry even louder to your God
[51:24] you see it says in First Kings 18 27
[51:28] this is
[51:31] and it came to pass at noon
[51:34] that Elijah mocked them and said
[51:39] cry aloud for he is
[51:42] either he is talking
[51:46] or he is pursuing or he is on a journey
[51:52] or perhaps
[51:55] and must be awakened
[51:58] you see their God
[52:01] media Studios he was not a real God Amen
[52:05] and they thought he was amen
[52:30] that yeah
[52:32] and like I read ikomolei
[52:36] it says Elijah said he said
[52:41] how long will Yeehaw between two
[52:43] opinions amen
[52:48] now I ask you tonight
[52:52] how long are you going to be going back
[52:54] and forth amen
[52:58] when are you gonna finally make your
[53:00] decision
[53:01] I mean amen because God is coming soon
[53:04] amen we don't have much more time
[53:08] we might think we're young
[53:11] we have all the time in the world Amen
[53:15] but that's what a lot of us think
[53:17] but time is getting shorter
[53:20] we have to make a decision
[53:23] amen amen
[53:25] and I would like to read this other
[53:28] scripture on John 2 17
[53:33] and it says and his disciples remembered
[53:36] that it was written and tons is
[53:49] great energy or enthusiasm
[53:53] in pursuit of a cause
[53:56] for an objective
[53:59] amen I don't know
[54:01] I don't know what your zoo is
[54:04] where your enthusiasm is towards amen
[54:08] but I hope it stores the things of God
[54:11] Amen
[54:12] you see I don't know what is eating you
[54:14] up
[54:16] it's the zoo of the Lord
[54:21] or if it's the Zeal towards the world
[54:23] Amen you see if you have a Zeal that's
[54:26] lukewarm because
[54:28] that's mediocre okay that's all in vain
[54:32] amen
[54:34] you see we have to have a zoo
[54:36] that is
[54:38] 100 amen you see when we watch our
[54:43] favorite shows
[54:46] um
[54:49] we're doing our favorite things
[54:56] we're not living anything right
[55:02] amen when we're courting amen
[55:06] you see this is a big one for the Youth
[55:08] amen
[55:09] when you're recording you want to do the
[55:13] best you can
[55:15] say
[55:16] the best I can for whoever I'm courting
[55:19] with it
[55:21] and the women the same for the man amen
[55:25] you want to give it your eyes
[55:28] you have that passion towards it
[55:31] you had that zeal
[55:34] and if we could just have that towards
[55:36] the things of God
[55:39] will do the rest amen you will have to
[55:42] worry
[55:44] about what you have to do all you have
[55:47] to do is trust in him
[55:49] I know that you're giving them your
[55:51] hundred percent
[55:53] we're talking in our small groups
[55:59] and my dad was saying he gave a little
[56:03] example he said if brother Ben has a
[56:06] little bit of Faith because
[56:12] he's not going to expect more Brother
[56:14] Band
[56:15] or he's not going to expect what Diego
[56:17] has from brother Ben amen
[56:22] Expressway
[56:26] you have tonight
[56:29] give it your all amen if you could play
[56:32] an instrument
[56:34] Venus
[56:59] yeah
[57:00] sorry Brothers
[57:04] but sad because
[57:06] we don't realize how ungrateful we are
[57:08] sometimes
[57:12] we don't realize what God has given us
[57:15] amen
[57:17] how privileged we really are amen
[57:22] you see
[57:24] seeing our brother John there in his bed
[57:29] you see
[57:31] um I don't know if you guys went to go
[57:33] visit him you know
[57:35] but it's something great to see him back
[57:38] amen
[57:39] I don't know if he's here but amen it's
[57:42] a great American amen
[57:46] and I don't want to get to the point
[57:48] so where God has to put me in a position
[57:51] like that
[57:53] for me to realize what I can do for him
[57:57] for me to finally raise my hands amen
[58:03] amen for me to give him glory amen
[58:11] for you to realize
[58:14] what God could do to you amen well you
[58:18] could do for God Amen
[58:21] and I just want to read a quote real
[58:23] quick
[58:35] now what was the difference
[58:39] the whole country was rolling with these
[58:41] prophets
[58:44] but here's one man amen
[58:48] the reason that he knowed he was right
[58:52] and he come out he was right
[58:56] he was standing on the saith the Lord
[58:58] amen
[59:00] God's promise
[59:02] and he know that no matter how many
[59:04] preachers
[59:07] or how many denominations
[59:10] or how many kings and how many anything
[59:13] else said anything contrary to it
[59:18] God's word will prevail
[59:22] if he stands
[59:25] had to stand by himself with the whole
[59:27] nation against him
[59:31] but he stood there alone on the word of
[59:34] God
[59:37] knowing that God would keep his words
[59:40] because Elijah said
[59:44] when he cursed him there by the Lord and
[59:47] said
[59:51] the dogs will lick your blood because
[59:53] that evil thing you done
[59:58] how could that man turn around and
[1:00:01] predict blessings
[1:00:06] on there by a genuine
[1:00:09] prophetic
[1:00:11] he know nothing could happen but evil
[1:00:16] so he stayed on the word of God
[1:00:20] and he stood alone before the whole
[1:00:22] nation is
[1:00:25] preachers and doctors of
[1:00:28] uh around him
[1:00:32] and everything else he stood alone with
[1:00:35] God
[1:00:37] you see you sometimes we have to stand
[1:00:40] alone with God Amen
[1:00:43] you see it doesn't matter what others
[1:00:45] think amen
[1:00:46] you see what your friends think look
[1:00:50] you see a lot of people in the shop in a
[1:00:54] shop they ask me amen or I'll ask them
[1:00:57] usually first I'll ask them what are you
[1:01:00] doing this weekend
[1:01:02] you know they'll usually tell me oh
[1:01:04] we're gonna go to Denver
[1:01:06] or I'm having a barbecue
[1:01:11] taking a couple of drinks
[1:01:14] I'm gonna go smoke tonight
[1:01:21] and then they turn around and ask me
[1:01:23] amen
[1:01:24] they said what are you going to do this
[1:01:26] weekend
[1:01:28] and you know I used to be embarrassed to
[1:01:30] tell them amen
[1:01:32] I'm not gonna lie man I used to hide
[1:01:35] around the corner amen
[1:01:39] um you know it's shameful you know as
[1:01:41] you to do that amen
[1:01:44] I used to tell him you know I don't got
[1:01:47] nothing planned just be with the family
[1:01:48] amen
[1:01:50] I go to a park on Sunday amen
[1:01:53] Domingo go play some volleyball
[1:01:56] volleyball if you want to go you could
[1:01:58] go amen
[1:02:01] um but you know now when God works in
[1:02:04] your heart amen
[1:02:05] one tells them amen
[1:02:07] [Music]
[1:02:09] no I have you serious amen
[1:02:11] and we don't realize how much people are
[1:02:14] in need amen
[1:02:18] and when they hear that
[1:02:20] they're like you service they start
[1:02:23] asking you wait wait what's that yes
[1:02:26] the service we have specifically
[1:02:53] you're giving out the church information
[1:02:55] amen
[1:02:56] when that passion grows inside of you
[1:03:00] you know there's nothing that's going to
[1:03:02] stop you amen no embarrassment is going
[1:03:05] to stop you
[1:03:06] your friends aren't going to stop you if
[1:03:09] your friend doesn't raise your hands
[1:03:12] that's not going to stop you no boy
[1:03:14] because when God works in you you don't
[1:03:16] care amen you don't care to shout amen
[1:03:19] amen you don't care to raise your hand
[1:03:21] you don't care to stand up and give
[1:03:24] thanks to God Amen
[1:03:29] amen and before I close
[1:03:33] I would like to read one more um verse
[1:03:36] Corinthians
[1:03:44] amen God will never give you more than
[1:03:46] what you could handle amen
[1:03:50] when it says there hath no temptation
[1:03:52] taking hold of you but such as is common
[1:03:56] to man no owes us
[1:04:02] God is faithful
[1:04:04] he will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:04:07] beyond that which ye are able to Bear
[1:04:09] okay
[1:04:12] but with the Temptation will also make a
[1:04:15] way to escape
[1:04:20] that he may be able to Bear it
[1:04:24] amen how many give thanks to God
[1:04:27] no matter what you're going through
[1:04:29] tonight
[1:04:31] the way you will go through
[1:04:33] just know God knows amen
[1:04:39] but just know he made a way for an
[1:04:42] escape amen
[1:04:44] amen and before I give this spot to our
[1:04:47] brother Isaac
[1:04:50] I just want to say
[1:04:52] what are you passionate about uh
[1:04:55] are you going to be hot
[1:04:59] are you going to be cold amen or what's
[1:05:01] that for you we can't be looking vendiga
[1:05:14] Los Angeles
[1:05:16] God bless you Brothers
[1:05:18] it's amazing to see is
[1:05:21] that there's not an empty seat
[1:05:25] that means there's hunger for the word
[1:05:27] of God
[1:05:30] and this time it says that Israel
[1:05:34] in the Israel says there will be a
[1:05:37] drought for the word of God Amen
[1:05:45] amen yes that's right brother let's read
[1:05:49] first in James 5.
[1:05:53] our title tonight again is even with
[1:05:56] temptation is
[1:06:00] and James 5 reads verse 16 Juan capitulo
[1:06:08] we create everyone in the name of the
[1:06:10] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:13] and it reads confess your faults one to
[1:06:16] another and pray one for another that
[1:06:18] you may be healed the effectual fervent
[1:06:21] prayer of a righteous man availeth
[1:06:31] mucho and the next verse says
[1:06:35] Elias was a man's subject to life
[1:06:37] passions as we are and he prayed
[1:06:40] earnestly Elias
[1:06:54] my focus tonight brother is
[1:06:59] the effectual fervent prayer Isla is
[1:07:05] and I have
[1:07:07] lived this in my life and
[1:07:13] um maybe tonight you'll see me shed a
[1:07:15] tear yeah
[1:07:18] but many times when we speak of a man
[1:07:21] like Elijah whichever is
[1:07:24] you would expect him to be a great Angel
[1:07:28] and I'm taking this from the message
[1:07:31] Elijah from brother Brandon
[1:07:36] 1953
[1:07:39] he says or some sort of sainted person
[1:07:42] that was dropped out of heaven
[1:07:46] but the Bible said that he was a man's
[1:07:49] subject to life passions as we are
[1:07:53] um
[1:07:55] he has his ups and downs his trials his
[1:07:58] indifference
[1:08:03] but he prayed earnestly
[1:08:07] that it wouldn't rain
[1:08:09] now back to our where we find this uh
[1:08:14] saying fervent prayer
[1:08:19] the effectual fervent prayer of a
[1:08:22] righteous man availeth much
[1:08:26] the English word for fervent
[1:08:29] in English
[1:08:32] means and passion
[1:08:36] or forceful
[1:08:39] passionate
[1:08:41] heartfelt
[1:08:43] Corazon powerful
[1:08:46] or wholehearted
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:08:50] and it seems to indicate so Indica that
[1:08:55] someone
[1:08:57] that is half-hearted okay
[1:09:03] that the prayer will not be as effective
[1:09:09] has anyone ever prayed that way
[1:09:13] and you feel God doesn't listen
[1:09:16] well thanks to God
[1:09:19] that there is a way to pray yeah
[1:09:29] he continues saying
[1:09:33] but God answered his prayer because he
[1:09:36] prayed earnestly and sincerely foreign
[1:10:09] how many times have we prayed outside of
[1:10:12] the will of God
[1:10:14] now I understand why
[1:10:18] why I don't receive the things
[1:10:22] we have a father
[1:10:24] that knows what's better for us
[1:10:29] God told Elijah it would rain
[1:10:33] so he prayed under God's Will
[1:10:37] and that was a fervent prayer
[1:10:42] now listen to this the reason that a
[1:10:45] prophet would pray that God would
[1:10:47] off the reins that it wouldn't rain
[1:10:57] a prophet starving the people to death
[1:11:03] could you imagine that
[1:11:05] a centered person a Godly Man a prophet
[1:11:09] major prophet one of the greatest in the
[1:11:13] Bible
[1:11:19] pray that God wouldn't even let it rain
[1:11:22] to bring food on the earth
[1:11:27] now listen to this understanding here
[1:11:32] for he knew it was a great mistake
[1:11:36] for the people to have plenty to eat
[1:11:41] and today lost and be lost in torments
[1:11:47] but then it says it would be better
[1:11:52] that they had nothing to eat
[1:11:57] it would be better if I had nothing to
[1:12:00] eat
[1:12:02] it would be better if you had nothing to
[1:12:04] eat
[1:12:06] and go to heaven
[1:12:09] amen amen says and that's true today
[1:12:14] what's the matter with we American
[1:12:16] people guess
[1:12:20] we're well fed and fattened up it's the
[1:12:23] most
[1:12:25] and we just think we got everything made
[1:12:29] and it's the same thing with Israel yes
[1:12:33] it got into a place in the rain
[1:13:11] and we forget where it comes from
[1:13:15] amen amen
[1:13:17] now I'm be closing now brother
[1:13:21] a draw for the word of God
[1:13:26] what about a drought for a miracle
[1:13:30] what about a trout to be free
[1:13:35] amen Amen brother Branham says
[1:13:40] why this won't happen
[1:13:44] says brother I tell you
[1:13:47] when a man's really getting hungry and
[1:13:50] thirsting for God
[1:13:55] he'll receive it
[1:13:57] the trouble of it is
[1:14:00] that the church is not hungry enough
[1:14:04] tonight for God
[1:14:08] it's the reason the holy spirit is not
[1:14:11] moving in church
[1:14:15] brother Brandon how does this healing
[1:14:17] foreign
[1:14:41] and so will it work tonight
[1:14:47] in a trout or anything else
[1:14:51] how many feel like you've been in a
[1:14:54] drought
[1:14:58] where you feel dry
[1:15:00] where you feel like you're about to
[1:15:02] break
[1:15:04] when you feel your heart is so hard
[1:15:08] but thanks to God brother
[1:15:12] that I was in those
[1:15:15] footstepsos and I had a mother
[1:15:18] and a church you neglesia
[1:15:22] and I'm so privileged to have you is
[1:15:26] that my mother was hungry enough
[1:15:30] and God wasn't gonna let her starve of
[1:15:33] America
[1:15:37] when she was praying for me
[1:15:40] when all of you were praying for me
[1:15:43] that's Esso was a fervent prayer
[1:15:48] and I owe my life to you
[1:15:51] because I shouldn't be here
[1:15:54] but you were hungry enough
[1:15:57] my mother was hungry
[1:16:00] and now you have to be hungry enough
[1:16:04] for whatever your need is
[1:16:07] hungry for your healing
[1:16:10] hungry for your family
[1:16:13] hungry for the word of God
[1:16:15] just like it says there would be a
[1:16:17] drought for the word of God
[1:17:10] it didn't matter what it is
[1:17:14] I knew it was going to happen
[1:17:16] I knew God was gonna make a way
[1:17:22] understand
[1:17:30] like you're about to die Brothers
[1:17:33] I don't know how to explain it
[1:17:36] like it's death in life yes
[1:17:40] between the wall and the swords
[1:17:44] like if it's the last resource
[1:17:48] but it's the best resource
[1:17:51] you know greater
[1:17:54] there's nothing traitor
[1:17:57] then a fervent prayer
[1:18:00] and effectual prayer
[1:18:03] and then this
[1:18:06] we have ministers
[1:18:08] we have brothers here and I believe are
[1:18:11] surrender to God
[1:18:13] you know a lot of us are suffering
[1:18:17] I'm one of them and I'm not ashamed
[1:18:21] because the heart the gospel that's what
[1:18:25] keeps me bubbling look at me brother
[1:18:28] Brandon says
[1:18:30] he came to a fountain
[1:18:33] and he asked it what makes you bubbles
[1:18:37] is it the deer that come and shrink said
[1:18:42] bury that commentary
[1:18:45] and if the phone could speak back it
[1:18:48] would say
[1:18:51] no brother
[1:18:53] there's a life running through me
[1:18:56] that's making me Bubbles
[1:18:59] and Romans 1 16 says
[1:19:04] my brother Isaac was talking about being
[1:19:06] ashamed is
[1:19:12] don't be ashamed don't be ashamed read
[1:19:17] this verse with me
[1:19:19] Romans 1 16.
[1:19:22] romanosis says for I am not ashamed of
[1:19:25] the gospel of Christ
[1:19:28] for I am not ashamed of the Christo
[1:19:38] for it is the power of God
[1:19:42] unto salvation
[1:19:45] to everyone that believeth
[1:19:49] we've all been lost
[1:19:51] but it's been God's power
[1:19:55] it's been the gospel yes
[1:20:13] let's not be ashamed of the Gospel
[1:20:18] it's the power of God
