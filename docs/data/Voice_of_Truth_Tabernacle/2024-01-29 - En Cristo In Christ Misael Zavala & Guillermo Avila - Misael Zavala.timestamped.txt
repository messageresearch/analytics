[29:16] Bible First Thessalonians 4 verse
[29:21] 16 we're thankful with the
[29:24] Lord and the pastor for the opportunity
[29:27] to be here we send them
[29:30] greetings to our brothers watching
[29:32] through the
[29:36] internet first Thessalonians
[29:48] 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend
[29:51] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[29:53] of Archangel and with the Trump of God
[29:55] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[30:01] if you can follow me to Luke 17 verse
[30:08] 26-30 as it was in the days of Noah so
[30:10] shall it be also in the days of the son
[30:12] of
[30:19] man they did eat they drank they married
[30:22] wives they were given in marriage until
[30:24] the day that Noah entered into the ark
[30:26] and the flood came and destroyed them
[30:33] all likewise also as it was in the days
[30:36] of lot they did eat they drank they
[30:38] bought they sold they planted they
[30:45] builded but the same day that law went
[30:47] out of Sodom it rained fire and
[30:49] brimstone from heaven and destroyed them
[30:54] all even thus shall it be in the day
[30:57] when the son of man is
[30:59] revealed you can bow your
[31:02] head beloved Heavenly
[31:05] Father we thank you
[31:09] Lord for giving us life this
[31:12] day to come and hear your word Lord
[31:16] Lord a day like this
[31:19] Sunday because there's not an eighth
[31:22] day there's seven days
[31:25] Lord and on the
[31:28] if there
[31:29] was you entered in the
[31:35] resurrection and Lord you entered into
[31:38] heaven you resurrected on that
[31:42] day and we ask you to resurrect us with
[31:46] your word
[31:48] Lord give us life
[31:52] Lord Lord I ask you anoint my
[31:55] lips and anoint the ears of the
[31:58] hearers that this morning Lord you give
[32:02] us life with your word we thank
[32:05] you put this service in your hands in
[32:08] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[32:11] you may be
[32:14] seated for a
[32:18] title my brother and I have titled our
[32:21] sermon
[32:23] in in in Christ uh
[32:29] we're speaking on the coming of the
[32:33] Lord the coming of the Lord is made of
[32:36] three parts or or or three
[32:42] phases the
[32:44] shout voice of
[32:47] Archangel and Trump of
[32:56] God we have studied the shout
[33:01] now and now we're moving on to the voice
[33:04] of
[33:06] Archangel that is the resurrection of
[33:08] the
[33:14] Dead in the Old
[33:18] Testament we always seen the shadows and
[33:25] shapes of what's happening in these last
[33:34] days the
[33:36] shout is a call to come
[33:40] out a
[33:43] message just like Abraham and Moses were
[33:46] called to leave from their
[33:49] Homeland
[33:52] Resurrection we can see it in
[33:55] Moses when the Archangel Michael fought
[33:58] over his
[34:01] body and we were taught that God
[34:03] resurrected
[34:06] him because in that Transfiguration of
[34:09] the Lord Jesus
[34:11] Christ the apostles would see
[34:15] it and the
[34:18] Rapture that is what's next to
[34:22] come we can see that in Enoch and
[34:25] Elijah
[34:29] having said
[34:32] this I'd like to read Leviticus
[34:38] 23 a type of the resurrection of the
[34:41] Lord Jesus
[34:43] Christ and type of the Resurrection
[34:46] that's following the one we're waiting
[34:50] for Leviticus 2310 and
[34:55] 11
[34:57] this is speaking of the Feast of
[35:00] Israel Israel had many
[35:05] feasts but here we're gonna focus on
[35:22] one speak unto the children of Israel
[35:24] and say unto them when ye become into
[35:27] the land which I give unto you and shall
[35:29] reap the Harvest thereof then ye shall
[35:31] bring a sheath of the first fruits of
[35:33] your Harvest unto the
[35:41] priests and he shall wave the sheath
[35:44] before the Lord to be accepted for you
[35:46] on the tomorrow after the Sabbath the
[35:47] priest shall wave
[35:51] it here it's talking about the first
[35:55] resurrection is
[35:58] the first fruit is a type of the Lord
[36:00] Jesus Christ because he was the first to
[36:05] resurrect so that
[36:07] sheath that is
[36:11] waved represents the resurrection of the
[36:14] Lord Jesus Christ
[36:17] uh in the message it is rising of the
[36:20] sun preached
[36:24] 1965 paragraph 37
[36:40] if there would be any holy ritual it
[36:42] should come forth on the Sabbath day
[36:43] which was the seventh day of the week
[36:45] which was Saturday but did you notice in
[36:48] this Memorial to wave it on the first
[36:51] day of the
[36:55] week
[37:00] the sheath which was the first of your
[37:02] seed that you planted when it comes up
[37:05] and ripens you cut down his sheath and
[37:07] take it to the
[37:17] priest and let him take it and wave it
[37:19] before the Lord for acceptance that you
[37:21] are
[37:25] accepted
[37:35] you have come with your sheath and he is
[37:37] to wave it before the Lord not on the
[37:40] Sabbath the seventh day but on the first
[37:42] day which we call
[37:55] Sunday
[37:57] of course that's a Roman word which they
[37:59] called it in the Sunday for the Sun God
[38:02] but how it's changed it's not s n
[38:06] anymore it's s o n d a y the Sunday that
[38:10] the corn of week God's first one come up
[38:13] from the
[38:22] dead it is to be waved over the
[38:24] congregation that we are his seed
[38:40] and that's the first of the seeds of
[38:42] those that slept waved upon the first
[38:44] day of the week on Sunday he raised up
[38:46] waved goodbye and ascended upon on high
[38:48] in the presence of the
[38:55] people
[38:58] notice it was the first corn of God's
[39:00] wheat that had been raised from the dead
[39:02] God's first corn of
[39:14] Wheat by God's quickening power God had
[39:17] quickened his life raised him up from
[39:19] the dead and he was the first fruits of
[39:21] those that slept the first fruit he was
[39:23] that
[39:25] sheath
[39:37] that's why they had to wave that sheep
[39:39] for it was the first one that came to
[39:40] maturity and it was waved as a memorial
[39:43] of Thanksgiving to God believing that
[39:45] the rest of them would come it was a
[39:48] sign it says it was a
[39:52] sign now this is what we're trusting
[39:55] in
[39:57] because we believe the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:00] resurrected and because he
[40:04] did and he resurrected the dead from
[40:07] that time and gave us the
[40:10] promise that he would resurrect in this
[40:13] time the ones that slept in this age now
[40:17] if you notice
[40:22] here that sheath was
[40:25] waved on the first
[40:29] day but the week only has seven
[40:33] days so Sabbath the
[40:37] Saturday is the last day for the
[40:42] Jews so that represents the seven Church
[40:46] ages seven
[40:48] ages with a promise of a
[40:52] resurrection after the seventh
[40:55] age
[41:00] Leviticus 23:15 we'll continue
[41:11] reading and ye shall count unto you from
[41:14] the tomorrow after the Sabbath from the
[41:16] day that ye brought the sheath of the
[41:17] wave offering seven sabbaths shall be
[41:25] complete
[41:29] even until the tomorrow after the
[41:31] seventh Sabbath shall ye number 50 days
[41:33] and you shall offer a new meat offering
[41:35] unto the
[41:37] Lord what it's saying
[41:41] here after the day of rest that's the
[41:44] seventh
[41:48] day says seven weeks shall be
[41:52] fulfilled seven Church
[41:55] ages
[42:03] even until the tomorrow after the
[42:05] seventh Sabbath shall you number 50 days
[42:07] and you shall offer a new meat offering
[42:10] not
[42:13] notice the grain had been
[42:15] offered the first fruits that happened
[42:21] already but here is speaking of a new
[42:24] grain or new meat
[42:27] what is that new
[42:29] grain have you asked
[42:33] yourself if there's been a new
[42:37] grain because God the Lord Jesus
[42:42] Christ God poured himself in the Lord
[42:45] Jesus Christ
[42:47] completely and it was the first grain to
[42:49] reach
[42:51] maturity but there's another grain that
[42:53] will
[42:54] mature another words it's already
[43:00] matured we'll continue reading it is the
[43:02] rising of the sun paragra
[43:17] 41 as Christ was the first one toas from
[43:20] all the prophets and so forth all those
[43:22] Ted in many places he was the first
[43:25] fruits of those that slept in the bride
[43:27] coming of Christ coming out of the
[43:41] church there will have to be a sheath
[43:44] waved again in the last days oh my
[43:45] waving of the sheath what was that
[43:55] sheath
[44:00] the first one that come to mature the
[44:02] first one that proved it was we that
[44:04] proved it was a sheath Hallelujah I'm
[44:06] sure you see what I'm talking
[44:09] about it was waved over the
[44:19] [Music]
[44:21] people and the first time though will
[44:23] come forth from the bright age for
[44:26] Resurrection out of a dark
[44:30] denominationalism will be a
[44:32] message that was the shout the message
[44:35] is
[44:45] here that the full maturity of the word
[44:48] has turned back again in its full power
[44:50] and being waved over the People by the
[44:52] same signs and wonders that he did back
[44:54] there
[44:58] time the same thing that happened with
[44:59] our Lord Jesus Christ back there is
[45:01] happening now with
[45:04] who with a new mature
[45:17] grain because I live ye live also
[45:19] speaking to his wife because I live you
[45:21] live also what a resurrection that
[45:24] was
[45:33] and what a resurrection this is to be
[45:35] quickened from the dead to be made alive
[45:37] in Christ Jesus by God's quickening
[45:48] power he was waved to them the word
[45:50] which he was was waved back to them on
[45:52] the day of
[45:54] Pentecost
[46:00] the word made manifest now and as I say
[46:03] it it's to be waved again in the last
[46:09] day you can follow me to First
[46:11] Corinthians 15 verse 20 to
[46:18] 23 but now is Christ risen from the dead
[46:21] and become the first fruits of them that
[46:24] slept
[46:29] for Since By Man Came Death by man also
[46:31] came the resurrection of the
[46:36] Dead for as in Adam all die even so in
[46:39] Christ shall all be made
[46:47] alive but every man in his own order
[46:49] Christ the first fruits afterward they
[46:51] that are Christ at his
[46:53] coming Pablo Paul is
[46:57] here
[47:01] narrating these three stages of the
[47:04] Lord's
[47:05] coming on verse
[47:11] 20 he says but now is Christ risen from
[47:14] the dead and become the first fruits of
[47:16] them that
[47:18] slept Paul is saying here this has this
[47:21] is completed already this is
[47:24] done but 23
[47:30] says but every man in his own
[47:34] order Christ the first
[47:36] fruit afterward they that are Christ at
[47:39] his
[47:41] coming it says at his
[47:44] coming that's the other
[47:47] Resurrection why because 20 already
[47:51] happened verse 20 already
[47:54] happened the resurrection had happened
[47:59] already so in verse 23 it's another
[48:05] Resurrection so we can understand a
[48:07] little
[48:09] Christ what does Christ
[48:11] mean the
[48:14] anointed the
[48:17] anointed the word says there also false
[48:22] anointed a known example is
[48:28] bamed by
[48:30] the he had word of God he
[48:35] prophesized but he had the wrong
[48:38] Doctrine that's what made him
[48:42] false so Christ means
[48:47] anointed we know that in these last days
[48:50] there was a anointed sheath by the
[48:54] Lord
[48:56] I continue reading in the message 965
[48:59] paragraph
[49:24] 39 and today because he was the first
[49:26] Son of God to come to full maturity to
[49:28] be in God he was plucked up from the
[49:30] earth and is waved over the people oh
[49:32] what a glorious Lesson by the quickening
[49:34] power the first one although he had been
[49:36] typed and many times as we'll see later
[49:39] that he was typed but this was really
[49:41] the first fruits of them that
[49:54] slept
[49:57] he was waved over from Over the promised
[49:59] seed that had promised of life he was
[50:03] waved at the day of Pentecost when there
[50:05] came a sound from heaven like a mighty
[50:07] rushing wind and was waved over the
[50:09] people the Pentecostal
[50:11] people that was up at Pentecost waiting
[50:14] for the blessing to
[50:24] come
[50:34] and to be waved again we realize in the
[50:36] last day according to Luke
[50:39] 17:30 in the day in the sun
[50:50] day in the Sunday man will be revealed
[50:52] or waved again over the people
[50:58] brother Bram says it in verse
[51:00] 40 you can read this at
[51:05] home the message rising of the sun 1965
[51:08] you'll understand it
[51:14] better brother Bram doesn't say here who
[51:17] it is but he puts it this
[51:24] way
[51:28] now who is this son of man in the
[51:30] beginning was the word and the Word was
[51:31] with God and the Word was God and the
[51:32] Word was made flesh and dwell Among
[51:49] Us and all of the teaching that we have
[51:52] and the confirmation of the word of God
[51:54] by by the the word of God by Signs by
[51:56] wonders we see today that in the Book of
[51:58] Luke here as we just quoted from Luke
[52:01] the 17th chapter and the 13th verse and
[52:03] Malachi
[52:21] 4 and the different scriptures that we
[52:24] are acquainted with that the word again
[52:26] is waved over the people that the Dead
[52:28] traditions of man is dead and the Son of
[52:30] God is alive again with the baptism of
[52:32] the Holy Spirit right Among Us and is
[52:34] giving us
[52:38] life I'm run out of time and I won't
[52:40] have enough time to read the rest of my
[52:45] quotes in your home rising in the sun it
[52:48] explains it
[52:50] all so it's saying that in these These
[52:53] Times there will be another grain there
[52:57] is another
[52:58] grain that will wave God's
[53:03] word that grain reached his full
[53:06] maturity Jesus Christ in that
[53:09] grain P himself completely in this
[53:15] time I just want to leave you with
[53:19] this who was the one that gave the
[53:22] shout the shout
[53:26] says Jesus Christ gave
[53:29] it but Jesus Christ does not touch
[53:33] ground shout is the message of the
[53:38] hour but if Jesus Christ does not touch
[53:40] the Earth in this
[53:42] coming how will that shout
[53:46] happen through his
[53:50] Prophet Jesus Christ poured himself
[53:53] completely in a prophet
[53:56] that has the shout the
[53:59] grain waved for this
[54:03] age the grain that does not mature in
[54:05] this age the word of God
[54:10] says says for the
[54:12] same the
[54:14] same that with with a
[54:19] shout voice of
[54:22] Archangel so who will bring the voice of
[54:26] the
[54:28] same the word is telling you the same
[54:31] there won't be a difference there's not
[54:33] an
[54:35] eighth there's nobody else it says the
[54:40] same the same
[54:42] grain the same that
[54:45] matured but there is also a
[54:50] promise that is not only that
[54:53] sheath but the sheath
[54:56] is the first one to
[55:00] mature so if it's the
[55:02] first it means there are
[55:06] more that's referring to every one of
[55:08] you sitting here but for
[55:12] that we
[55:15] need for that we
[55:19] need come to Jesus

[57:06] this there is a
[57:10] resurrection we are waiting for the
[57:12] resurrection of the
[57:18] dead and that same preaching rising of
[57:21] the Sun the prophet
[57:23] says
[57:27] the resurrection has already begun in
[57:31] you when you receive the Holy
[57:34] Spirit the resurrection
[57:37] has sometimes we
[57:42] think and I sayen because we speak that
[57:44] the Rapture is
[57:47] happening but before the raptures the
[57:51] resurrection and although it says we
[57:53] will receive him in the
[57:56] you must die to
[57:57] yourself to be
[57:59] resurrected
[58:01] spiritually my brother can please come
[58:04] and God bless
[58:05] [Applause]
[58:11] you
[58:18] hallelujah we're happy in this morning
[58:21] Brethren He is wonderful
[58:31] not sure if he is for
[58:34] you but for me he's my
[58:42] absolute for me he's the
[58:45] [Music]
[58:49] proof he is everything I can
[58:53] desire and his name is the Lord Jesus
[58:56] Christ amen
[58:58] amen how many are waiting on
[59:03] him we titled our
[59:10] sermon more on brother M's
[59:15] behalf and it went more with what I
[59:18] have and we titled it in
[59:23] Christ don't
[59:26] finish with my thought because it's
[59:32] plenty I'd like to give it to you in the
[59:34] beginning so you understand where I'm
[59:36] head the scripture says
[59:41] that first Thessalonians
[59:49] 416 for the Lord himself shall descend
[59:51] from heaven with a
[59:53] shout
[59:55] with the voice of
[59:57] Archangel and the Trump of
[1:00:01] God shall descend from
[1:00:04] heaven
[1:00:06] in and the dead in in in
[1:00:11] Christ that's why my thought is in
[1:00:17] Christ
[1:00:20] specific the dead in
[1:00:23] Christ
[1:00:25] shall rise
[1:00:28] first here is a
[1:00:32] dma here is where we go
[1:00:37] anywhere here is where some
[1:00:40] believe here's where somebody
[1:00:43] something here's where the
[1:00:46] message where the message takes its own
[1:00:53] way message
[1:00:57] Believers believe in the return of the
[1:01:01] Prophet a 5% believe he
[1:01:05] is and here is where things get
[1:01:08] divided so this ain't milk this is
[1:01:15] me this is where your soul depends on
[1:01:17] what you
[1:01:22] believe you cannot let Another Sunday go
[1:01:25] by
[1:01:29] here here you cannot be
[1:01:32] settled us as
[1:01:37] head we cannot be
[1:01:41] resting and
[1:01:43] just you need to go to the
[1:01:46] word Jesus Christ is the word we need to
[1:01:52] go and match what we've been
[1:01:55] told and I don't want to get into
[1:01:58] detail because I'm not the
[1:02:00] pastor I'm not responsible
[1:02:03] for pastor is the one responsible for
[1:02:07] and I believe it's his right to bring
[1:02:11] this I'm only going to say what the
[1:02:13] prophet
[1:02:15] says if there's anything that he
[1:02:18] says he said say what's on the
[1:02:22] tapes say it just how I
[1:02:26] say try to
[1:02:28] interpret say it like it
[1:02:31] is if you say it like it
[1:02:34] is what the word
[1:02:36] says you are
[1:02:39] sure you can't
[1:02:43] lose when I try to interpret what the
[1:02:49] prophet problem is when I try to
[1:02:50] interpret what the word
[1:02:52] says that's where we get in trouble
[1:02:55] there's no
[1:02:57] need and I recommend
[1:03:00] you my heart has
[1:03:03] been in these last days
[1:03:06] we been crying out to the
[1:03:09] Lord Me A
[1:03:12] Sign speak to my
[1:03:15] heart I don't want to depend on reations
[1:03:18] of
[1:03:20] others I want my own
[1:03:23] revelation
[1:03:25] what other ones believed is not good for
[1:03:28] me I want what you give to
[1:03:31] me give me my own
[1:03:34] Revelation and faith is
[1:03:37] revelation without faith it's to please
[1:03:44] God so you need to be sure about
[1:03:48] something and I stay
[1:03:50] there I don't understand everything and
[1:03:54] I'm waiting on
[1:03:55] him a brother once told
[1:04:03] me I understand some things I didn't 10
[1:04:06] years
[1:04:10] ago and as you're walking God is showing
[1:04:14] you and you're
[1:04:17] understanding there will be things later
[1:04:19] on that you'll understand that you don't
[1:04:21] understand
[1:04:22] now that's fine
[1:04:26] but if there's something I'm sure
[1:04:28] about is that the scripture
[1:04:32] says the dead in
[1:04:35] Christ 100% sure about
[1:04:40] that you are in Christ
[1:04:43] Jesus if you are inside
[1:04:48] him whomever plays the
[1:04:52] Trump whoever sounds the
[1:04:57] Trump you will
[1:04:59] rise if you are in
[1:05:03] him because the point is to be in
[1:05:07] him
[1:05:10] Abraham bought a
[1:05:13] property bought a property
[1:05:15] brother and he
[1:05:19] said there I will bury
[1:05:23] Sarah
[1:05:25] Abraham himself was buried in that
[1:05:27] place there was a
[1:05:30] place a literal
[1:05:33] place it was a piece of land Abraham
[1:05:40] bought and who else was buried there
[1:05:43] Isaac who else was buried
[1:05:45] there
[1:05:49] Jacob Joseph
[1:05:52] was why
[1:05:55] because they wanted to
[1:05:57] be because they wanted to
[1:05:59] be because they wanted to be
[1:06:03] there why did Joseph himself Joseph
[1:06:07] himself do not leave me in Egypt one
[1:06:12] dayall one day God one
[1:06:16] day he will visit
[1:06:18] us and don't leave me
[1:06:21] here take me with you
[1:06:26] me in that
[1:06:29] spot a specific
[1:06:32] place because he
[1:06:34] believed that in that
[1:06:37] place would be the
[1:06:41] resurrection a specific
[1:06:44] location now in the scripture says
[1:06:47] there's
[1:06:48] another a
[1:06:50] place and that
[1:06:53] place with all of my
[1:06:56] heart is in Christ
[1:06:59] Jesus he's the
[1:07:01] rock Alpha and Omega is the beginning
[1:07:05] and
[1:07:06] end is everything for
[1:07:10] me I'm not waiting on anyone else I'm
[1:07:13] waiting on
[1:07:15] him I'm waiting on
[1:07:18] him one day he'll raise me
[1:07:22] up one day he'll raise me me

[1:07:33] s way before in the
[1:07:39] back he was buried in that
