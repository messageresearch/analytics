[11:16] you know we are not worthy but
[11:20] you see us through your blood
[11:23] and that's why we were here Lord
[11:25] we just surrendered ourselves to you
[11:28] that you would use this
[11:30] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[11:32] amen amen
[11:38] if you would open your Bibles up to the
[11:40] book of Colossians chapter one
[11:44] we'll be reading from verse 20. and 21.
[11:53] the Bible says like this is
[12:02] and having made peace through the blood
[12:04] of his cross by him to reconcile all
[12:06] things into himself by him I say whether
[12:09] they be things on earth or things in
[12:10] heaven
[12:16] is
[12:23] reconciliado
[12:29] and you who were once alienated and
[12:32] enemies in your mind by Wicked works
[12:34] even now hath he reconciled in
[12:37] the body of his flesh
[12:41] is
[12:45] flesh through death to present you holy
[12:48] and unblameable and
[12:51] unreprovable in his sight
[12:53] you may be seated
[12:57] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:02] we have come here on Earth occasions and
[13:04] I've gotten I've escaped pero
[13:08] but you can run as much you can run very
[13:11] much
[13:12] we can't run from God
[13:15] hey amen
[13:20] I would like to title this this talk
[13:25] who am I
[13:27] right
[13:29] I hope that God would help me
[13:32] yeah
[13:32] [Music]
[13:35] I want you to know that I'm not a
[13:39] preachera it's not a good thing to say
[13:41] perhaps because
[13:43] if you need an operation
[13:45] and you go to a doctor
[13:49] and the doctor tells you he's not a
[13:52] surgeon
[13:53] you're like well I'm gonna go look for a
[13:55] surgeon
[13:57] I tell you I'm not a preacher but I'm
[14:00] your brother
[14:02] so yeah
[14:04] in Cristiano I'm a Christian
[14:08] who struggles every day
[14:11] full of many heirs
[14:17] you're gonna be telling you testimony we
[14:21] bought a home
[14:22] and we've been Remodeling
[14:25] and we've knocked down walls
[14:27] and we've added
[14:30] and if you enter into my home
[14:34] you'll see a disaster
[14:37] many things look incomplete
[14:42] but we continue working
[14:54] [Music]
[14:57] when I get home from work I want I I get
[15:00] I go to my house and I try to do
[15:02] something
[15:02] because I desire to finish
[15:08] my desire to see it a finished product
[15:20] [Music]
[15:58] to be able to fulfill our our dreams
[16:02] [Music]
[16:03] to see the work of our hands
[16:07] and see the the dream fulfilled yeah
[16:57] we want to see the finished product
[17:00] but it's not easy
[17:05] we are in a struggle
[17:08] which is real yes
[17:11] it's a struggle that we we fight every
[17:14] day
[17:17] and the devil doesn't give way
[17:20] it doesn't give you time to think
[17:25] he's waiting for the moment that you're
[17:27] careless but uh
[17:30] so that he could uh so that we would
[17:33] stumble mistakes
[17:34] maybe I'm the only one
[17:40] um
[17:44] the first time I'm going to be speaking
[17:46] on this dream that I had oh no
[17:50] I don't know I had to explain how I did
[17:54] it was about 2005.
[17:59] I'm almost forgetting it but my wife
[18:02] reminded me yeah
[18:05] [Music]
[18:19] the moment came when God revealed to me
[18:21] what was happening
[18:25] I was struggling a lot with work
[18:31] it was a 2008 forgiveness
[18:35] uh
[18:46] [Music]
[19:30] face to face
[19:34] it was something very odd
[19:37] pero is
[19:40] if God was speaking to it to me
[19:43] I was speaking I was speaking to myself
[19:46] yes
[19:48] and the person I saw before me
[19:52] was I was mocking me
[19:54] is the
[19:57] um
[19:58] it was as if it was it was looking at me
[20:01] like like in a despiteful way
[20:03] but at the same time kind of mocking me
[20:09] I remember seeing him
[20:14] so I was between us asleep and awake yes
[20:22] and I felt like I was being bullied
[20:25] something within me
[20:29] foreign
[20:39] and I said you know what
[20:42] is I'm a son of God
[20:46] and you know very well
[20:51] I said I don't care
[20:54] uh
[20:58] how much you make me or fall into the
[21:01] mud
[21:08] I know I'm a son of God
[21:13] [Music]
[21:14] and I will reign with him in eternity
[21:18] and for many time that troubled me for a
[21:21] long time that troubled me
[21:24] but at the same time he gave me strength
[21:27] because I said yes I am the Son of God
[21:31] I began to surrender more and more to
[21:33] God
[21:36] and began to do what I could
[21:40] to help a church
[21:43] we built a church
[21:46] I was always there
[22:07] I was doing it for God
[22:13] and I got into the habit of listening to
[22:15] tapes
[22:16] and I had tapes all the time
[22:20] in my on my headphones
[22:26] that was giving me a lot of spiritual
[22:28] strength
[22:31] and I felt unworthy yes
[22:34] I felt that like a man with many flaws
[22:39] but I also knew that God saw me as a
[22:42] finished product
[22:45] resume and I knew that God was working
[22:47] through me
[22:48] and God continue to help me
[22:53] so I thought strong
[23:00] but the Bible says they think in terms
[23:03] of strong beware that he not fall is
[23:14] you begin to relax as the brother said
[23:16] this morning
[23:18] and then you think you have it made
[23:22] you think you can overcome anything
[23:25] you feel like you're invincible
[23:34] and the devil has many years but uh
[23:38] he's had many years of experience
[23:41] to know how to trap you
[23:46] and all he's waiting for is for that
[23:49] time you begin to get careless
[23:52] and when you least expect it you'll be
[23:54] on the ground
[23:55] yes
[23:57] the devil will be mocking
[24:01] yeah that's the truth Brothers
[24:11] for example I I see my home
[24:15] and I see it it's it still needs a lot
[24:18] of work
[24:19] but it's not the same as when we began
[24:26] [Music]
[24:28] you can see a lot of work has been done
[24:32] sometimes I see myself
[24:36] uh
[24:40] and I I began to get depressed because I
[24:43] see it I like a lot of things
[24:46] when you get the mirror of the word
[24:49] you begin to uh see yourself
[24:54] and see all your imperfections
[24:57] and see all the things that you're
[24:59] lacking the devil tells you
[25:02] uh so much time and you continue to
[25:06] struggle with it
[25:10] but if you look the house isn't the same
[25:15] man
[25:19] yes
[25:23] my wife and I have we were just had 25
[25:26] years of marriage
[25:30] when we had to 25 years
[25:32] we are remarried is
[25:38] my wife's friend said I said you're
[25:41] going to marry the same man
[25:43] he said no he's not the same Glory
[25:47] right
[25:49] [Applause]
[25:54] yes
[25:55] and that is only the grace of God
[25:58] [Music]
[26:00] and the mercy of God okay
[26:03] that's been working in our lives yeah
[26:06] this is
[26:08] I feel like we need to surrender a
[26:10] little bit more
[26:14] but I can recognize
[26:16] there's not a there's not a better thing
[26:19] than to serve God
[26:23] there's not another person that can help
[26:25] us
[26:25] only God
[26:31] so I thank God for my wife
[26:34] [Music]
[26:39] because uh you may not believe it but
[26:42] she has helped me very much
[26:46] I believe that if it wasn't for her then
[26:48] I wouldn't be here
[26:51] I would have threw in the towel mini a
[26:53] long time ago yeah
[26:56] yes
[27:11] she's one of the ones that God always
[27:13] answers her prayers
[27:15] if we have a home it's because she asked
[27:17] God foreign
[28:15] I couldn't eat
[28:39] and I uh I went into the bathroom to uh
[28:42] to spit out some phlegms
[28:45] and when I made the effort to to cough I
[28:49] fainted
[28:52] the next thing I heard was just a loud
[28:55] cracking
[28:58] crash
[29:01] and I was on the ground
[29:04] I was just there a confused days
[29:08] and my wife came and she said what
[29:10] happened
[29:11] I said I don't know help me help me get
[29:13] up
[29:16] and I I told her I got up and I said I
[29:18] told her take me to the emergency room
[29:21] I told her I think I broke my leg
[29:25] we went to the hospital
[29:28] they took an x-ray
[29:30] from my chest and from my knee
[29:33] they said you have nothing
[29:36] we're going to give you we're going to
[29:38] give you a bomb there
[29:40] and send some pills for the pain yeah
[29:44] I was working with a client it's
[29:46] actually a doctor
[29:48] and I told him that I hurt my knee I
[29:52] told him the story
[29:56] he asked me if I wanted an MRI
[29:59] I said that that'd be fine
[30:03] he made the appointment at the hospital
[30:06] and I went in
[30:08] and when they sent him the results
[30:14] he told me sorry but your knee is very
[30:16] very dangerous
[30:21] from the front and from the inside and
[30:24] are the ones on the side
[30:26] [Music]
[30:27] you're gonna have to get operated on
[30:30] yeah
[30:32] I told them well if I needed
[30:36] he said don't worry I know the best
[30:38] surgeons in Phoenix
[30:44] so that it won't be so expensive
[30:47] that moment begins
[30:51] in Texas and one of them he charged
[30:57] I thought it would be more results
[31:01] [Music]
[31:03] it was 3 000 plus anesthesia plus the
[31:06] place the operating room yeah
[31:09] it ended up actually being 14.
[31:15] [Music]
[31:59] looking about six months
[32:02] you're barely going to be able to
[32:04] support your knees uh
[32:16] he told me I hope you're ready for about
[32:18] a year where you don't work
[32:20] I told my wife okay she said what
[32:24] without working
[32:26] no come on let's pray for you Europe for
[32:29] me and she prayed for me
[32:31] and in less than a week I was working
[32:35] in less than a month
[32:38] I didn't even have the knee brace on
[32:40] anymore
[32:41] and I went with the clients
[32:46] and he said what are you doing
[32:48] I I said
[32:51] he says you don't have your knee brace
[32:55] hurts
[33:02] and I told them it didn't hurt he said
[33:06] that's not possible
[34:05] we want to know what you
[34:24] and then they they asked me for the
[34:26] physical therapist information
[34:29] but in our reality it was the prayer of
[34:31] my wife
[34:34] she just didn't want me I said she
[34:36] didn't want me there just being late she
[34:39] didn't want me to just be there at home
[34:40] but here recently
[34:43] there was another virus going around
[34:47] that affected
[34:49] and it was draining my energy
[34:52] one day I was working
[34:56] and I I wasn't able I went home
[34:59] and just there I fell on the bed
[35:03] and that's how my wife found me just
[35:05] laying there in the bed
[35:07] she said what happened
[35:08] I I told her I don't know I just was
[35:11] just very tired okay she said oh that's
[35:13] fine and the next day was the same I
[35:17] went to work
[35:18] and I felt very very tired and I went
[35:22] back home yeah and just as I fell there
[35:25] in the bed that's how my wife would find
[35:27] me
[35:29] he said no that's not right
[35:31] I'm gonna pray for you
[35:34] assistant
[35:45] [Music]
[35:47] so sometimes you get accustomed or used
[35:49] to the things
[35:51] and it becomes so normal
[35:54] but the Miracles go over our head
[35:57] and we don't no longer see them
[36:02] sometimes God pinches our conscience
[36:06] and we realize that God is with us
[36:12] another trial like that is
[36:17] he is here with us
[36:22] he's been here at home for uh for a time
[36:24] now
[36:27] and God had to bring him with a broken
[36:29] leg but God brought him yes
[36:33] and it's due to the prayers of my wife
[36:35] but
[36:42] um the situation my family was going to
[36:43] with with uh
[36:47] it was one of the things that the devil
[36:49] was using to attack me
[36:52] [Music]
[36:53] I couldn't speak about that with anyone
[36:55] yes
[36:58] I heard somebody I was someone talking
[37:01] when I was Thomas one time we were at a
[37:03] restaurant
[37:03] and they were telling my wife
[37:06] you know I saw your son
[37:09] and it hurt me to see him yes
[37:14] I could not hear that
[37:19] get up and leave because I would begin
[37:22] to cry
[37:25] and the devil was just hitting me there
[37:27] yeah
[37:30] but then God comes
[37:33] and he reminds us of the promises
[37:41] [Music]
[37:46] to know that that it's all worth it
[37:49] and to be on alert foreign
[38:24] we get lost if I'm lost I'm lost
[38:28] and it's a very sad thing to think that
[38:30] way
[38:35] but we know that it's only the process
[38:37] that we're going through
[38:38] and when we feel the most lonely
[38:42] we're just simply listening to a tape
[38:47] you can hear the you can feel the
[38:49] injection of the strength yes
[38:52] you can feel as though that somebody has
[38:54] given you oxygen yeah
[38:56] and then you want to begin to fight
[39:00] and then and the best defense is is the
[39:03] attack
[39:04] when you feel attacked
[39:08] just stay there you just like do nothing
[39:13] you have to swing back
[39:17] you have to hit the devil
[39:19] and the best way to hit him
[39:22] is to say I'm a Son of God
[39:26] by the blood of the Lord
[39:30] the Lord Jesus Christ is working in my
[39:32] life
[39:49] come forward
[39:56] thank you
[40:01] 've been together thank you God bless
[40:03] brother Sergio
[40:05] always good to hear
[40:08] that what God does
[40:13] God works different with everyone
[40:16] and we all struggle somewhere
[40:22] there is not one person that doesn't
[40:24] struggle
[40:26] momento but the time comes
[40:28] when we say where is
[40:31] where is it with what I struggle
[40:34] it's only like a memory
[40:37] porque de La promoted because he has
[40:41] promised to help us and he helps us
[40:46] even ourselves helping ourselves it's
[40:49] him and us
[40:53] I'll be reading
[40:57] Colossians
[41:01] from verse 24 to verse 29.
[41:06] the reason I'll be reading that
[41:13] Focus only on 27 is
[41:22] because it has a
[41:25] semi-colon and colon and then a period
[41:29] till 27.
[41:36] so God is trying to tell us something
[41:38] here
[41:41] Colossians 1 24 says
[41:48] carne locaff Iglesia
[41:55] who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[41:57] and fill up that which is behind of the
[41:59] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[42:01] his body's sake which is the church
[42:11] a
[42:15] La palabradios whereof I made a minister

[42:20] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[42:23] the word of God

[42:34] ages and from Generations but now is
[42:36] made manifest to his Saints Mysterio
[42:44] gentiles guess
[42:48] to whom God would make known what is the
[42:51] riches of the glory of this mystery

[44:32] and you feed us
[44:35] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[44:37] amen
[44:38] you may be seated
[44:44] um
[44:48] began speaking a few Sundays ago on the
[44:51] team of God
[44:53] yes
[44:55] a very good subject I believe Domingo
[45:01] passage
[45:04] I believe it was last Sunday we shared
[45:07] that we're an important piece
[45:09] okay
[45:27] related to the same thing
[45:32] I was thinking on this star God gave me
[45:37] under the subject he is in me
[45:44] he is in me
[45:48] and this is
[45:51] that God's gonna speak
[45:55] I saw it
[45:57] foreign
[46:46] I know it's a prophet speaks of God's
[46:48] triple purpose
[46:51] and God's first purpose
[46:54] was to reveal himself to man is
[47:01] to express himself
[47:35] the prophet says when God was alone
[47:38] what a thing
[47:41] this takes us before there was an atom
[47:44] before it was
[47:48] a star
[47:49] before there was a tree
[47:52] before anything existence
[48:02] of the world
[48:14] the back of his mind
[48:21] when he was alone
[48:23] it is
[48:26] I believe in my opinion
[48:28] that the first thing
[48:31] was Angels
[48:36] now he had something to worship
[48:38] but nothing else existed
[48:54] did not know that
[49:03] why are you so afraid of the devil
[49:13] s
[49:14] yes he can come and tell you
[49:17] all the things
[49:22] other than the things
[49:30] when God formed you
[49:35] you can't come and torment me with
[49:37] anything
[49:40] God had a purpose
[49:44] or
[49:45] nuestro primero Padres when he plays our
[49:49] first Father's Adam and Eve
[49:54] now he has someone to worship him here
[49:58] again
[50:02] someone who he could manifest
[50:04] that's what the prophet is
[50:08] the ministry of God revealed ah
[50:12] but they had to fall
[50:16] did you know they had to fall
[50:19] they had to fall
[50:39] in the back of his mind
[50:47] when they fell
[50:49] is so he already knew that
[51:12] that was inside him
[51:15] tanto why are you so sad
[51:25] this is the prophet says
[51:28] God gradually begins
[51:32] so bring forth his purpose Moises
[51:39] typed everything in the Lord
[51:46] Jesus
[51:52] it was a mystery
[51:55] yeah
[51:58] Jose Joseph
[52:02] go and see
[52:04] and see Jesus
[52:29] because he is there
[52:32] that's right
[52:47] we cannot understand
[52:53] the creature that lives
[52:58] we had to become one of us
[53:06] that's why he presented himself
[53:21] it could
[53:23] [Music]
[53:34] I Rejoice with this
[53:38] I see him
[53:42] you know I weep alone
[53:45] but of joy
[53:49] [Music]
[53:55] everything here's hears for me
[54:07] now he was displayed but he had it in
[54:11] secret
[54:16] he came to his own
[54:20] what did you come to albino he came to
[54:24] his own to die
[54:27] to redeem us
[54:39] the day of Pentecost
[54:43] he came and what he is
[54:49] he is so great brethren
[54:53] you know I see him everywhere I look
[54:57] is he is very great for me
[55:04] Pablo Paul
[55:07] is
[55:09] speaks of this secret mystery
[55:16] because it's no longer
[55:22] it's God in us
[55:25] inside us
[55:28] is
[55:32] the second purpose
[55:37] that he kept to himself
[56:10] what else do you want
[56:14] foreign
[56:51] he fell on the ground blind
[56:55] everyone

[57:01] but not everyone sees that
[57:04] yeah

[57:32] vision

[57:54] there
[57:56] sake
[58:10] yes
