foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you thank you foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] because I said you're [Music] good [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] this is [Music] [Music] be better to learn with me [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] can't believe [Music] Oh Glory Glory good morning [Applause] [Music] glory to visit [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] everybody [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] every time [Music] [Music] it is [Music] [Applause] [Music] I mean Hallelujah I believe that we are ready to receive his words how great is the love of God will you help me sing this song know how this is [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Glory oh to God [Music] oh to God if I lose [Music] [Music] [Music] so for me [Music] thank you Lord having your happy foreign it's a great opportunity it's not a better place because we're always working for God for his body for his people gratification it's it's something that comes with great gratification the opportunity we hope the answer in the same manner we'll take two scriptures we'll take a First Corinthians chapter 12. amen and we'll read uh verse 24 25 and 26. First Corinthians chapter 12 verse 24. the Lord reads like this is for our company parts have no need but God has tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked there should be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care for one for another what is uh the schism there would be no conflict or a disagreement or division yes and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members Rejoice with it we'll go to our first Chronicles chapter 11. First Chronicles chapter 11. edius verse 9 and 10. so David Works greater and greater for the Lord of hosts was with him these are also the chief of the Mighty Men Who David had who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom and with all Israel to make him King according to the word of the Lord concerning Israel now notice here these are these Mighty Men we're with David the word of the Lord says that they they straighten themselves with him in his kingdom now we'll jump to verse 22. I'm going to be focusing on this a little bit more in first Chronicles 11 22. who had done many acts he slew two lion-like men of Moab also he went down and threw a lion in a pit in a snowy day let us pray we're happy circumstances one should be happy and thankful we are here for you and we want to do you a service he would come on a scene and help us that my brothers would take for what I try to say and not for what I say interpretation as well as brothers each one of your sons and daughters they would receive what you have foreign oh the the theme is God's team as a subtitle it's a body without division and First Chronicles chapter 11. these chapters of the Bible it teaches us that David was captive um because he wanted to kill him but on the other hand that also wanted to kill him adelam but he was not alone there was this group of valiant men yes and the kingdom they were a group of elite it was the best of the best there was about 400 soldiers but this was the cream of the Cross this was a group of the Elites in order to defend their kids and defend the kingdom Defender and in this time I believe there's no exception we have a king a king of kings Justice what is needed God needs are you the hell people that desire to help they want to help a church I go to church what can I do for my sister that's the question a um to be a member of God's team um and not flee all right look which is many of these men they they fled when the Philistines would go and attack them they stayed and they faced the Philistines that's what is needed also not to run or flee although things make it difficult we need to stand firm yeah and support our Brethren help them protect them a third point the Mighty Men of the Kingdom they defend the kingdom the David's Mighty Men they stayed there to defend the king and the kingdom and they they fought with him uh shoulder to shoulder now look amongst the group were these menombre a certain area there were also tremendous men Aya there was this man by the name of banaya he was a a Mighty Man we just read in the scripture he killed two lions and when I read that story foreign [Music] this man killed his giant this Egyptian he was he came with a with a spirit descended against him he kills that Egyptian but what catches my attention the most is it this this courageous maniah he kills another lion and this line was a a a natural lion and a second Samuel 23 20. we just we just read it he said he went down into a pit and killed a lion on a snowy day the Bible doesn't say around there but he faced him this lion to eat man he was a cousin and you know and he and he and he was he was right there he was in the village he was terrorizing the the people that populated The Village but the Bible says he descended to fight with him now look to fight in the snowy day temperatures what a a very uh the temperature was very cold it's not just anything but that that did not stop banaya is from going to a place many times we make an excuse of the climate conditions it makes it great even more and here was banaya he was being hunted and there was banaya hmm is I imagine maybe maybe they were there around the cave and it was a snowy day maybe there was a lot of snow around you know when the ground is is filled with snow you don't know what's beneath the snow and then I imagine that goes against the Lions and the line goes in and jumps towards him but this this line takes a fast and it falls into a pit goes to the edge of the pit there and he looks at The Lion and the lion looks at him and they they they they they look at each other I imagine banaya it was a sign of death all of a sudden from the cave a hand comes out all right it's the hand of banaya with wounds on his body and scratches across his body where it bites across his body but it was the reflection is fears that he had and when he comes out imagine yes there were many stitches needed to heal those wounds but perhaps a lot of medication but when he recovers there was King David a lion and a bear yes he had won such a great uh you want to be a part of that team yes foreign problems in your marriage perhaps that lion is defeating you or with addictions addiction to a drug it'll be a great problem wow that's good that's right that's right man this man Hallelujah the word says the book of Hebrews 11. verse 33 excuse me says through faith is subdued kingdoms righteousness obtain promises stop the mouths of lions they took care of him amongst them there was not any any false words there was not one that didn't feel for the other I believe they took care of one another foreign says here in the message and we'll be closing with this he cried out if I only had a drink from that well again his desire was a commandment to those who loved him sorry you know I believe that God's desires should be a commandment for those that love him remember the soul was crying for a drink of that water and those who loved him this desire was a commands we're told that one of those three of those men got together they were Gentiles the majority of them was gentiles oh God they weren't even Jewish people watch where they come from David David here's the type of Christ because Christ is crying for a drink of that water as I said Hombres down to that City While others then we're Gallant Fighting twice their size some of them but they were men who could fight [Music] 800 men right around him in one day they were great they trust you guys and brought that up to David so he could drink it wow I believe that this was a this was a truly a God God's team that's why God was with him that's why God gave him so many victories are being persecuted I believe that if we want to be a part of our scene Brothers and he thought of our beloved God it should be a commandment for us and we should act God bless you [Applause] Hebrews chapter 12. blessed be the name of the Lord is like this wherefore lift of the hands which hang down in the feeble knees and make straight pads for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed I think that the the God's Army God's team is a team that's in action God intended for his team that is doing something for God go down in the message just show us the father now our religion this is our religion this is Jesus Christ that microphone is a complete mute until something speaks into it we have nothing Church through us hallelujah hallelujah it says like this that's how many many women you are mute is when it comes to these things but if you're in contact you're in contact says [Music] you are not it's not your voice yes [Music] we are the people that got this again so that we could continue to be in movement paralysis [Music] Revelation for that I I I I want to go against it but I'm gonna go at it pretty hard [Applause] you know what happens he can paralyze the next member for me the Devil is a dog that has no power so he uses us we as members you know what brothers I'm going to say this is sometimes we as members instead of working as a unit or in unity I can paralyze another member faculty um [Music] what God wants us to achieve Glory figures in in the book of Ephesians chapter verse 11. this is God's team church and teachers but it doesn't stop there I have something to do say that foreign foreign [Music] I understand that I won't have the complete revelation are we are we okay I can't understand everything Church es how did you understand my brother has a part that he will teach me they don't understand to the Statue of a perfect man hey look that being said [Music] the pastor puts us to breach [Music] continue with me these we all have to understand we're part of that body that's it that's it maybe I don't understand we continue verse 14. this is that we have to be no more children somebody that's always fluctuating Brothers that's where you see the stature that's when you see if somebody understands their purpose and their maturity Brothers yeah we don't want you anymore [Music] I'll come back that's a mature person foreign there okay I have to continue verse 15. la verdad but speaking the truth in love is there's another small detail there we stand for the truth and back in the truth foreign forgiveness from brother Felix last week okay I just want to make sure we have to fix things right make them right give the Lord a round of applause [Applause] May grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ halfway [Music] no no it doesn't do things halfway I'm not going to be a tree thank you brother the Sun comes out every morning the things that God placed for their purpose every morning we enjoy the salad no cherries the brother says oh the ocean says it doesn't say well today I'm

calls you the pastor I haven't gotten into the main subjects here yet verse 16. cuerpo bien con certaro go ahead the whole body of Philly joined together and compacted but that which every joint supplies [Music] which every joint supplies according to official working propia in the measure of every part increase of the body onto the edifying itself in love the love is the church I'm not

shoulder is not joined to my arm it doesn't move so joined with one another Little Spirit would come and divide us that not just anything will divide us but you know what I believe that God throughout

the devil can't hold us back he doesn't have the power to hold his back the devil wanted to paralyze the devil has wanted to paralyze me multitude of times and when I get disconnected from the head is where the problem begins we want to be a successful let's be connected with the head coach they want to keep it is going to plan how the team is when the player says but I want to be a part of this
