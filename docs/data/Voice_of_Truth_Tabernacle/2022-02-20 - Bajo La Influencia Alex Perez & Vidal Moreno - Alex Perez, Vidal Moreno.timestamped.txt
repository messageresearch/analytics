[21:59] daniel answered and said blessed be the
[22:01] name of the god for ever and ever
[22:08] for wisdom and might are his
[22:18] and he changes the times and the seasons
[22:20] he removed with kings and set it up
[22:23] kings
[22:30] she gave it wisdom unto the wise and
[22:32] knowledge to them that no understanding
[22:36] verse 22 says

[23:03] hallelujah bueno
[23:05] um
[23:11] let's get in quickly brethren
[23:13] um
[23:16] i'm gonna try to connect from my end is
[23:17] that okay
[23:20] okay no okay
[23:34] so
[23:46] is exclusively for the gentile people
[23:49] daniel
[23:51] uno as we've seen daniel chapter one
[23:53] miramos la migracion del pueblos
[23:56] babylonia we see the immigration of the
[23:58] people of israel to babylon
[24:02] and in chapter 2 we see
[24:06] a dream this king had esther este
[24:10] of the king
[24:14] pueblo
[24:15] say it again it was exclusively for the
[24:17] gentile people
[24:18] lucas capitolo
[24:19] versiclo
[24:21] painting cuatro nos dice 21 24 tells us
[24:26] and they shall fall by the edge of the
[24:28] soil
[24:40] and jerusalem shall be trodden down
[24:43] or stop or stepped on por los quentiles
[24:47] of the gentiles hasta que los tiempos de
[24:50] los gentiles
[24:51] until the times of the gentiles be
[24:53] fulfilled
[24:56] so the bible tells us
[25:13] and the theme men are believed that have
[25:14] chosen
[25:16] fluency or title for our preaching is
[25:18] under the influence
[25:19] [Music]
[25:24] my objective for this morning is to
[25:25] bring a teaching
[25:51] [Music]
[25:56] and then the dream we see there's a
[25:57] golden head
[26:01] especially
[26:06] we all read a little of daniel chapter
[26:08] two so i can let loose okay okay
[26:11] daniel represents
[26:13] daniel represents the golden head okay
[26:21] understood that the golden hair cuando
[26:40] [Music]
[27:32] clearly
[28:00] we spoke
[28:12] other deities
[28:14] okay babylonia okay babylon different
[28:18] had different gods
[28:22] so they worshipped deities
[28:27] another influenced babylonian
[28:31] was pleasures of the flesh
[28:34] in babylonia in babylon
[28:41] they were
[28:42] let
[29:09] sexual and moral immorality
[29:14] yes
[29:16] all of this was babylon and this was all
[29:18] they had influence
[29:22] another influence was believing you're
[29:24] greater than others
[29:29] i belong was a great country bro a great
[29:31] kingdom
[29:34] they were the main people
[29:38] they
[29:48] babylon's influence was pride
[29:50] homosexuality it was homosexuality
[29:55] and worship of man
[29:58] are you with me
[30:01] babylonia
[30:03] babylon has power despues
[30:19] pectoral and arms of silver
[30:25] este
[30:28] now this kingdom
[30:30] condos was made up of two different
[30:33] imperials different empires
[31:01] they were tribes of great military
[31:17] that means before joining they bring up
[31:19] a military potential
[31:22] and it's people that know how to fight
[31:26] now the persians
[31:30] they were very subtle and mighty
[31:32] empire
[31:36] they had the god name ara mazda
[31:41] el sabio
[31:42] which means the wise lord
[31:56] with a lot of wisdom
[32:10] joins these two empires
[32:20] and now that's what makes the persian
[32:22] meads
[32:26] now the immersion pete's influence
[32:30] is this uh it was also to worship
[32:32] different deities yes
[32:35] and it's alliances
[32:39] in this case they love to join alliances
[32:46] influence of the persian means
[32:52] babylonians you know i'm not as strong
[32:53] as a babylonian
[34:04] of powers
[34:43] the stomach and
[34:45] the thigh of bronzer
[34:49] represents
[34:53] the third empire we see it under the
[34:55] empire of greece
[34:57] alejandro magno alejandro el grande
[35:01] we see alexander the greats as he is
[35:03] known
[35:05] is he had an ambition
[35:10] and it was that he wanted to conquer the
[35:12] entire earth
[35:14] or world
[35:17] and you know in his time he almost did
[35:19] it
[35:23] he was the one one of the ones that
[35:25] conquered the most
[35:27] grounded land over
[35:28] more than anyone
[35:31] conquering
[35:32] empires
[35:36] to conquer empires
[35:41] that was the greek empire
[35:44] influencia de gracia what was greek's
[35:46] influence dominion
[35:50] dominion and power
[35:52] conquistad
[36:07] they say he conquered so much but he
[36:09] never conquered himself
[36:10] it's
[37:33] because this is a subject that has no
[37:35] end
[37:36] that's right
[37:46] that all the empires before rome
[37:56] we're getting mixed until they reached
[37:58] rome roma rome
[38:02] romero
[38:18] we're not under the babylonic empire
[38:21] anymore
[38:22] influenza but we have an influence
[38:26] you can say brother we're not in the
[38:28] time of the means and persians but the
[38:29] same spirit is here great
[38:32] to acquiring things
[38:38] is there brother the worse
[38:48] like to read what brother branham says
[38:52] in the message three witnesses
[38:57] be careful with these empires or
[38:59] kingdoms
[39:03] because the influence still continues
[39:06] see what brother branham says
[39:22] this is the kingdom of the devil
[39:38] something great says brother brandon
[39:52] if you want to run for politics
[39:59] [Music]
[40:08] by those
[40:22] but
[40:47] you don't understand so i'll explain it
[40:48] he says
[40:49] jesus
[40:51] jesus no
[40:55] he inherits
[40:58] them anyhow
[41:06] so there are the kingdoms of the world
[41:09] but i want to tell you then there's a
[41:11] kingdom of god
[41:14] belonging to this earth side of the lord
[41:16] jesus christ
[41:39] look we could go back to daniel and get
[41:41] the image
[41:45] look at the image the head of gold el
[41:47] reyno babilonico the babylonian kingdom
[41:52] brass or silver
[41:54] los medo persia means or persia
[41:59] alejandro magno
[42:28] so
[42:36] and notice in these ten kingdoms which
[42:38] exactly come in those ten horns
[42:42] that we were speaking of this morning
[42:56] roman
[43:06] you might say the babylonian empire
[43:08] doesn't exist the persian needs
[43:10] inclusion including rome
[43:19] no more
[43:20] pero roma
[43:22] but rome was infiltrated
[44:06] already had those doctrines and dogmas
[44:10] or indigenous people when they came to
[44:12] mexico
[44:14] they told them a story
[44:16] of lies
[44:20] because the spirits came already
[44:25] now bring it to your own life
[44:29] what is influencing me
[44:34] because these spirits are still here
[44:39] those that have gold
[44:42] or wanna look fair
[44:46] el imperio papa hermanos
[44:48] el
[45:00] that's why it's a cave of demons
[45:15] we have to be very careful
[45:19] alejandro magno many times we're like
[45:21] alexander the great right
[45:23] i say for myself
[45:26] i want to conquer everything obtain and
[45:28] obtain
[45:58] inside
[46:23] god bless you brother
[46:25] [Applause]
[46:31] god bless you yo
[46:33] if you just stand uh with me for a few
[46:35] moments
[46:38] i'll open up your bibles
[46:46] we're going to be reading from verse 5
[46:48] and
[46:49] to verse 7.
[46:53] we're speaking
[46:55] on the message
[46:56] that we titled under the influence yes
[47:03] you know something had to bring us here
[47:07] there had to be a an influence
[47:11] you know that brought us to the house of
[47:12] god
[47:14] you know for many of you know for the
[47:16] youth you know maybe your parents
[47:17] brought you
[47:19] home
[47:21] maybe it wasn't your
[47:23] your will but it was your parents
[47:25] foreign but you know there was a there
[47:28] was an influence there no name fluency
[47:31] there's an influence that brings us
[47:34] you know uh to uh to to church
[47:38] you know i just you know we just pray
[47:40] that you know it's the influence of god
[47:45] amen amen uh psalm 75 verse 5 reads like
[47:48] this
[47:51] it says lift not up your horn on high
[47:54] speak not with the stiff neck
[48:04] for promotion cometh neither from the
[48:06] east nor from the west nor from the
[48:07] south fork
[48:13] says but god is the judge
[48:17] it says he put it down one and set us up
[48:20] another one
[48:22] uh you may be seated
[48:25] and when we talk about influence
[48:27] influenza uh like i said uh just a
[48:30] little bit ago
[48:33] we've all been under some kind of
[48:35] influence
[48:37] influence we've been uh we've been some
[48:39] of us have know what it's like to be
[48:40] under the influence of alcohol
[48:44] influence
[48:45] others you know have been under the
[48:46] influence of drugs
[48:50] you know but but that that's that's not
[48:52] the only thing you can be influenced by
[48:56] influence you know because we see here
[48:58] you know as brother uh alex was reading
[49:01] about the um
[49:02] about um daniel yeah
[49:07] how the the king had an influence
[49:13] but you know although he had an
[49:15] influence
[49:17] we have to see him many times
[49:20] you see where the influence the don de
[49:23] la influence that we are influenced by
[49:27] the influence
[49:28] influence
[49:38] [Applause]
[49:40] you know how we just many times we get
[49:42] influenced so easily
[49:46] you know of the the the presidents and
[49:48] the governors of this nation
[49:52] you know they'll talk about about
[49:54] immigration
[49:56] you know
[50:08] you know the people that aren't from
[50:10] this country
[50:39] of a population of your popularity
[50:43] and so that he could win the people over
[50:47] because it appears
[50:49] like he's doing a good thing
[51:07] because they they went the people over
[51:08] that way
[51:11] we know that's not of god
[51:14] the bible tells us
[51:17] that this influence is not from god's
[51:21] that influence comes from the depths of
[51:23] hell
[51:25] it comes from the depths of hell
[51:28] and what it does
[51:30] is it brings the people into
[51:35] and captivity exactly why the people of
[51:37] israel were in babylon
[51:42] because of the sins that were committed
[51:46] because the sins that were done by their
[51:48] by their
[52:00] i believe there's people here this
[52:02] morning
[52:16] from that time
[52:21] it says this
[52:23] there was a maniac one day up in gadaria
[52:27] who was cutting himself
[52:38] and his power of ten times in order
[52:41] of an ordinary man could break the
[52:43] powers of them chains is
[52:57] when the devil takes a hold of a person
[52:59] insane
[53:03] it takes men and men to hold him
[53:08] breaks them chains
[53:11] i completely surrendered to the devil
[53:16] i believe that this man
[53:19] did not want to be in this condition
[53:23] i believe that he he did not want to be
[53:25] captive
[53:40] he was
[53:54] that although
[54:07] he was taking him to a place
[54:21] he was predestinated
[54:56] [Music]
[55:00] he says he breaks them chains completely
[55:02] surrendered to the devil completely
[55:18] how much more
[55:32] you may have done
[55:45] you don't want to be
[56:00] you should have seen me before
[56:02] i was a lot worse
[56:05] you know i was looking at a picture
[56:07] a while back
[56:09] you know the the times before i went to
[56:10] church
[56:13] you don't know i just looked at it
[56:23] and i believe that's how many of us were
[56:24] because it's almost valuable and many of
[56:26] us still may be like that
[56:28] yeah
[56:44] [Music]
[56:55] your right mind
[57:07] [Music]
[57:10] the king's heart is in the hand of the
[57:12] lord
[57:16] as the rivers of water eternity
[57:18] whatsoever
[57:22] you see your king the buccaneer
[57:38] and you know i just want to read real
[57:40] quick
[57:41] though and it says in the second year of
[57:43] the reign of nebuchadnezzar
[57:48] dream dreams
[57:50] wherewith his spirit was troubled
[58:06] his dream
[58:21] to the kings
[58:23] it says oh king live forever
[58:27] it says tell thy servants a dream and we
[58:29] will show the interpretation
[58:34] the king answered and said to the
[58:35] chaldeans
[58:37] the thing is gone for me
[58:40] it says if you will not make known unto
[58:42] me the dream
[58:45] with the interpretation thereof
[58:48] you shall be cut in pieces
[58:50] and your houses shall be made a dung
[58:53] hill
[58:55] converted
[59:00] i wonder
[59:02] what kind of influence this king was
[59:04] under influence
[59:06] oh because you know he didn't get what
[59:08] he wanted
[59:10] he didn't get his way
[59:13] and he was ready to cut everybody to
[59:15] pieces
[59:29] i wonder if we're not ready to cut
[59:30] everybody to pieces
[59:33] get out of my way
[59:35] you can't give me what i want
[59:38] okay and we're ready to excommunicate
[59:41] the brothers
[1:00:08] you know and that's what this man was he
