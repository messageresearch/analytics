[28:42] [Music]
[28:55] and lord now i ask that you put myself
[28:58] aside lord
[29:01] cause man's word can fail
[29:06] but our mighty god's word can never fail
[29:22] you have something prepared for them
[29:36] your holy name your word lord
[29:51] amen amen and i'm gonna keep you
[29:53] standing for one a little bit more
[29:56] please open up to the book of job
[30:04] i'd like to thank my god once again for
[30:06] this opportunity
[30:11] and my pastor for allowing me to use his
[30:13] pulpit
[30:15] putting the desire in his heart amen to
[30:17] allow me to speak to his people
[30:34] because god should have already came i
[30:36] believe
[30:37] but thanks be by his grace he's giving
[30:40] us more time
[30:44] amen and the word of god says
[30:48] and the lord said unto satan which
[30:50] cometh thou
[30:51] then satan answered the lord and said
[30:53] from going to and fro
[30:55] in the earth and from walking up and
[30:57] down in it
[31:02] responds
[31:05] [Music]
[31:06] and the lord said unto satan has thou
[31:08] considered my servant job
[31:10] that there is none like him on in the
[31:12] earth a perfect and upright man
[31:14] one that feareth god and excu with evil
[31:21] hope
[31:29] then answered the lord and said did you
[31:32] fear god for not
[31:34] responding
[31:40] [Music]
[31:41] and then if we can quickly go to psalms
[31:43] 37 39
[31:48] amen but the salvation of the righteous
[31:52] is of the lord he is their strength
[31:56] in the time of trouble
[32:09] amen and reading this scripture
[32:12] psalms 37.
[32:15] i think i read that i think a hundred
[32:18] times to myself
[32:20] i read at least 100 times to myself
[32:26] and the more i read it
[32:30] the more i saw how great my goddess
[32:36] what he has in him for me
[32:40] because when we look at the parts of the
[32:43] scripture that says
[32:44] [Music]
[32:46] he is their strength in the time of
[32:48] trouble
[32:55] when i look at that and i put myself
[32:58] there
[33:02] when i was in my troubled times when i
[33:06] was times in dark times
[33:20] it made me start to ask myself
[33:26] that it's not only any type of strength
[33:28] in which god has
[33:30] no solamente but it's needed
[33:34] is necessary of a that's no
[33:38] like any other strength
[33:41] strength amen we find ourselves in
[33:44] trouble many of the times
[33:47] yeah it's the darkest moment in our
[33:49] lives and we find ourselves in the
[33:51] bottom of the pits
[33:52] [Music]
[33:54] worthless
[33:54] [Music]
[33:58] when we're there many of the times we
[34:01] feel
[34:03] god can never forgive us
[34:17] but thanks be to god for this beautiful
[34:19] promise
[34:21] he has given us in his word he has given
[34:24] a strength
[34:25] for that believer in troubled times amen
[34:28] i believe that's for you
[34:29] and for me to take off because it's
[34:32] neither of a supernatural strength
[34:34] is necessary not only to bring us out
[34:40] of our trouble but but many times we've
[34:43] been told
[34:46] here at church
[35:00] but many times we have the trouble
[35:03] i'm not forgiving our own self
[35:06] strength in which god has for us
[35:10] helps us not only come out of our
[35:12] trouble
[35:14] except
[35:20] [Applause]
[35:35] [Music]
[35:40] and many times we have been given many
[35:42] promises
[35:46] [Music]
[35:48] and many times we forget about them
[35:51] but the only way to know or remember
[35:55] those promises in which god has given
[35:57] you and me
[36:02] is to go to his word because that's what
[36:05] he has given us
[36:06] today used over there against the devil
[36:10] in the desert amen
[36:24] i believe there's many
[36:29] [Applause]
[36:38] there it's right there
[36:42] that he gave his only begotten son and
[36:44] whosoever believeth in him
[36:46] shall not perish but have everlasting
[36:52] life
[36:58] and i don't know if that's a promise but
[37:00] i believe that's a promise amen
[37:05] but whoever believes
[37:16] the devil likes to block us away from
[37:17] those beautiful promises from god
[37:32] depending on the situation
[37:48] whether you feel him or not he's always
[37:51] there
[37:55] many times god is always trying to
[37:57] reveal to us
[38:01] that he wants for us
[38:20] and tonight before i get ahead of myself
[38:23] uh the title in which i have to announce
[38:25] the subjects
[38:27] with my brother felix tonight america
[38:30] felix praying to god that he'd be using
[38:32] us to share this
[38:37] i believe brings purpose
[38:40] amen i want to ask you all a question
[38:43] who likes trouble here
[38:58] of the year our teachers would give us
[39:01] tests
[39:02] just to see where we were at many
[39:06] times we were never ready for those
[39:07] tests
[39:09] we never knew what was going to be on it
[39:43] [Applause]
[39:50] [Applause]
[40:00] [Music]
[40:01] [Applause]
[40:11] although it sounds very simple or very
[40:14] obvious the question is
[40:17] but i have asked myself why am i going
[40:19] through it
[40:22] why did this happen to me
[40:26] because i say or i try to justify myself
[40:30] by saying i come to church every
[40:31] wednesday friday and saturday
[40:50] that we could see god
[40:52] [Music]
[40:53] working in our lives it's through the
[40:56] trouble
[40:58] i want you to open up your mind a little
[41:00] bit tonight
[41:02] and i'm gonna simplify this as best i
[41:04] can
[41:25] [Applause]
[41:31] if there was nothing ever to be saved
[41:41] [Music]
[41:43] how can god be a restorer in your life
[41:51] and remember i said trouble brings
[41:52] purpose amen
[41:55] and i say how would we ever see the
[41:58] purpose
[42:00] inside
[42:12] let me tell you bro there's nothing that
[42:13] happens in your life
[42:20] [Music]
[42:21] [Applause]
[42:27] of the world
[42:32] [Music]
[42:34] sorry forgive me brother i know my
[42:36] redeemer liveth
[42:38] he says it was god's divine plan to do
[42:42] so
[42:44] if i and if we were go ahead
[42:50] and if we were put here for a purpose he
[42:53] says
[42:56] then there is nothing then there's
[42:58] nothing can destroy us
[43:00] until god's purpose is fulfilled
[43:03] [Music]
[43:08] nothing can harm us
[43:09] [Music]
[43:24] no matter how much trouble we have
[43:29] how much heartache
[43:32] sorrow that we go through all of these
[43:36] are reasons
[43:38] and there's a
[43:52] what god has purposed in his heart to
[43:55] bring
[43:56] past there is no demon
[44:00] there is no power there is nothing can
[44:03] ever separate god's
[44:04] great immortal eternal plan
[44:34] [Applause]
[44:35] i still have the audacity to ask the
[44:37] question
[44:43] why am i still going through this thing
[44:47] i thought god loved me i thought i
[44:50] thought god was
[44:51] all love peace and joy all the time
[44:56] but if we go to proverbs 3 3 chapter 12
[44:59] he says for whom
[45:44] we must go running
[45:58] and tonight i'm going to show you with a
[46:00] little testimony
[46:03] in one point in my life
[46:09] i remember in high school
[46:14] training classes
[46:19] in my desire truly in high school
[46:22] for the incorrect reasons
[46:23] [Music]
[46:26] i i thought having the best body
[46:30] you know what it would make me the
[46:31] greatest person ever
[46:34] little by little i started really
[46:37] getting into bodybuilding
[46:41] i started really sculpting my body like
[46:43] those great bodybuilders you see
[46:48] i started taking certain proteins
[46:50] certain things
[46:54] that i should have never
[47:04] all those things that i thought would
[47:05] help me better my body
[47:23] and it helped me lose weight faster
[47:28] yeah and that took me to even more
[47:30] things yes
[47:32] and the deeper i got more into that
[47:36] the more i saw myself separating myself
[47:38] from god
[47:40] because many of the times as young
[47:42] people
[47:44] we have certain goals we have certain
[47:46] plans in our life
[47:50] we want to reach
[48:03] trouble in my life
[48:09] [Music]
[48:16] for him before the foundation of the
[48:18] world
[48:32] although
[48:36] god is wanting more than anything
[48:39] to show you that
[48:42] it has a perfect plan made for you yeah
[49:25] what you were meant to do
[49:46] [Music]
[49:50] i would have never known that he was
[49:51] with me
[49:53] i would have never needed him in my time
[50:10] because after porque es pues after a
[50:12] while kept on
[50:14] working out and doing things
[50:19] it was on my mother's birthday
[50:23] where we were going where we went to the
[50:24] store
[50:30] [Applause]
[50:33] [Music]
[50:36] and in the car the other car flipped
[50:38] over
[50:42] [Music]
[50:51] [Music]
[51:01] i had like a i was doing skull crushers
[51:03] like they call them
[51:09] [Music]
[51:19] it
[51:34] the knowledge that i forgot from
[51:36] bodybuilding
[51:42] the shoulders are one of the most
[51:44] precious things that you can have
[52:11] and again
[52:14] i see more than ever masking
[52:44] because he wants to prove okay
[52:47] and show the enemy
[52:50] he has something in us that he can't
[52:52] take away
[52:56] before the foundation of the earth
[53:04] oh thank you god as this time i'll be
[53:06] giving the place to my brother
[53:08] felix
[53:11] and if we can take tonight
[53:25] even though you're failing time after
[53:27] time after time
[53:31] there's a true purpose for it
[53:34] you just must pray to god
[53:38] he revealed that to you
[53:53] he shall
[53:56] god bless you
[54:13] god bless each and every one of you
[54:14] tonight
[54:17] i don't know can you hear me
[54:20] uh if you can please stand for a
[54:22] vibration
[54:37] uh troubles bring preparation problems
[54:40] drain of proposito and they have a
[54:44] purpose behind it
[54:47] if you can open your scripture to the
[54:49] first book of jeremiah
[54:56] chapter verse 5
[55:05] before i formed thee in the belly i knew
[55:08] thee
[55:09] and before thou cometh forth out of the
[55:11] womb i
[55:12] sent sanctified thee and ordained
[55:16] thee a prophet into the nations antis
[55:32] lugar
[55:46] you know he he asked me do you want to
[55:48] preach
[55:52] and i told him sure you know
[55:55] something that brother fidel was talking
[55:57] about
[56:04] you know he was talking about joe yes
[56:08] and you know how and and and i just want
[56:11] to
[56:11] just just overview it
[56:15] you know when when job he was a great
[56:19] man
[56:23] and and he he was very blessed
[56:27] but god took everything away from him
[56:31] you know and and and and the devil told
[56:33] god
[56:36] you know you're you're you're gonna he's
[56:38] gonna curse you
[56:41] you know but you know but job stayed
[56:44] firm
[56:49] it didn't matter if everything was taken
[56:50] away from him
[56:54] you know he is
[57:04] you know when god comes and he takes
[57:06] things away from us
[57:10] you know some of the things that we may
[57:11] thought we may have for a long time
[57:15] you know that they were going to be
[57:16] around us for a long time
[57:20] you know we're going to have this job
[57:21] for a long time
[57:24] you know it's
[57:38] you know he takes things away from us
[57:44] and we're there it's almost like and
[57:47] we're like
[57:47] why is this happening to me
[57:52] why
[58:34] god
[58:42] [Music]
[59:02] [Music]
[59:30] there is nothing
[59:46] you know sometimes god lets tests and
[59:49] trouble come to us
[59:55] you know you know he he lets that happen
[59:58] to us sometimes
[1:00:02] i believe your crew you know
[1:00:05] if if we didn't maybe didn't have those
[1:00:07] troubles
[1:00:10] you know we we wouldn't take notice on
[1:00:12] how blessed we are
[1:00:16] everything that god has done for us
[1:00:20] everything that god is doing for us
[1:00:24] you know we we wouldn't we wouldn't we
[1:00:26] wouldn't take notice in it
[1:00:28] you know our life would have just been
[1:00:29] so simple
[1:00:38] i want to read this this quote from
[1:00:50] and remember no matter how great the
[1:00:52] distress is
[1:01:21] it is
[1:01:36] you you know so he so you can have more
[1:01:41] fellowship with god
[1:01:45] more in your life there is nothing that
[1:01:49] can stop that
[1:01:50] noise
[1:01:58] [Applause]
[1:02:10] [Applause]
[1:02:16] he knew what you as a person was capable
[1:02:18] of
[1:02:20] [Music]
[1:02:31] but we need that seed to grow
[1:02:35] when have you noticed that they're there
[1:02:37] something beautiful hasn't grown
[1:02:46] until there has been dirt on it
[1:02:50] you know there has to be dirt on it
[1:03:00] so
[1:03:03] you know sometimes we just need a little
[1:03:04] dirt in our life
[1:03:09] so it can help us develop
[1:03:14] you know because dirt has the fertilizer
[1:03:17] it has a nutrient
[1:03:26] that new that nutrient that helps you
[1:03:28] push through this is nutrients
[1:03:32] to push through the dirt
[1:03:38] so you can grow so you can grow into
[1:03:42] something beautiful
[1:03:56] work works is faith expressed
[1:04:03] now here now here is a predestinated
[1:04:07] plan
[1:04:07] in plain view
[1:04:25] prepared beforehand
[1:04:30] if you sowed a scene
[1:04:33] and just threw it out there on the
[1:04:35] ground
[1:04:38] it
[1:04:53] i can't pronounce those words this
[1:04:54] tizzles or thrones
[1:04:56] implemented it will choke it out pretty
[1:05:00] soon
[1:05:03] so god in his sovereign grace enthusiasm
[1:05:45] that's why that's the reason why we
[1:05:47] straggled i can't pronounce that word
[1:05:49] is straggled out of these things
[1:05:55] and strata is stratter into what you
[1:05:58] have
[1:05:59] and to what you have now yeah
[1:06:42] you know god already prepared everything
[1:06:44] for you
[1:06:58] god is working with you
[1:07:02] he is working for you
[1:07:05] he you know it you he has no intention
[1:07:08] of doing you any evil
