[19:41] again
[19:44] [Music]
[19:50] Lord Jesus Christ uh
[19:55] is
[20:01] chapter one verse 2.
[20:06] first before you guys find the
[20:09] scriptures
[20:11] I would like to first thank God
[20:19] to allow us to use his pulpits
[20:23] and also to send a very special groups
[20:29] may God bless them
[20:31] um
[20:33] [Music]
[21:00] it captures my attention
[21:03] we see that it's got on the scene
[21:08] let's read Nehemiah 1. they say
[21:13] Manos hombres
[21:19] is
[21:26] one of my brethren came he insert men of
[21:29] Judah and I asked him concerning the
[21:31] Jews who had escaped who were left
[21:33] behind from the Captivity and concerning
[21:35] Jerusalem foreign
[21:48] he heard
[21:50] we're talking about a
[21:53] uh
[21:56] that is in your body
[21:59] he heard
[22:02] and sometimes by what we hear depends
[22:05] we're going to act according accordingly
[22:08] okay right uh
[22:29] who are left behind from captivity
[22:31] they're in the province or in great
[22:32] Affliction and reproach the wall of
[22:34] Jerusalem also is broken down and the
[22:36] gates thereof are burned with fire
[22:42] foreign
[22:57] certain days and fasted and prayed
[22:59] before the god of Heaven
[23:04] that's your word Lord
[23:11] help me Lord to be able to explain
[23:14] myself
[23:16] to be able to express who you placed in
[23:19] my heart
[23:22] and my brother's ears
[23:27] hear and meditate on the words
[23:30] this is the name of the Lord Jesus
[23:32] Christ
[23:37] remember we're speaking on the coming of
[23:39] the lord
[23:40] it's a very beautiful topic
[23:44] now that I was allowed to share
[23:48] I began to study a little more on this
[23:51] stop
[23:54] and the picture opens up foreign
[24:06] [Music]
[24:58] and that's why I said when when Nehemiah
[25:00] heard
[25:02] he didn't react the scriptures
[25:07] that his brothers
[25:15] now the question is why did Nehemiah cry
[25:57] [Music]
[25:59] are you doing well
[26:26] the walls were still destroyed
[26:29] sanctification
[26:48] okay
[27:24] there's work to do
[27:26] there's a very much work
[27:30] but the laborers
[27:36] here Brothers
[27:38] is that what Nehemiah heard
[27:41] he didn't say
[27:45] yes
[27:51] [Music]
[27:52] that captures my attention
[28:09] it's been a while since some of them had
[28:11] returned
[28:17] he grabbed it and took it
[28:22] is
[28:35] you individually
[29:27] it wants to react quickly
[29:32] my wife tells me I'm yelling too
[29:35] glory to God
[29:41] I just want to inject this here I want
[29:43] to express this
[29:44] I'm that way Brothers
[29:47] I'm not upset with you I love you
[29:51] yeah
[29:52] that's how I am God made me that way but
[29:55] I love you
[29:59] [Music]
[30:00] my intention is never to offend anyone
[30:08] but I just want to express that to you
[30:10] right now
[30:13] forgive me Brothers but God made me that
[30:17] way
[30:19] so what am I going to do
[30:26] Bueno
[30:29] yes
[30:31] forgive me Brothers
[30:34] it's good
[30:38] it's because when God comes to your life
[30:44] and you begin to reflect on your own
[30:46] life
[30:47] with the word of God
[30:50] you say
[30:52] I like very much I like a lot
[30:57] I'm the first sinner
[31:00] I'm the first one to fail
[31:03] uh
[31:14] and the Holy Spirit begins to put you in
[31:16] order
[31:20] Nehemiah began to cry
[31:23] a pastor says this is
[31:26] he says in the message
[31:34] let me tell you when Nehemiah cried
[31:36] because the walls were torn down
[31:39] and because the enemy was coming
[31:49] and he says something has to be done I
[31:51] think that represents
[31:57] place your name there yes
[32:09] the cry has already come
[32:12] on
[32:16] the word has already been revealed
[32:20] well the problem that we're struggling
[32:22] with okay
[32:24] una is because
[32:26] we're lazy in reading
[32:29] and two we don't ask for Revelation but
[32:33] he says
[32:35] God revealed to us his words
[32:43] but now you don't have to be restored to
[32:46] be able to stand against the enemy La
[32:48] Novia if we are the brideos for the last
[32:51] days
[32:53] we have to be ready
[32:58] to be ready to fight
[33:01] we also have to know ourselves
[33:05] we have to know the enemies
[33:08] but I also know myself
[33:23] foreign
[33:56] Cinco
[34:21] you have to care for these five senses
[34:25] because that's the windows
[34:29] that goes into the soul
[34:31] or to the spirit okay
[34:37] I'd like for you to understand that this
[34:39] is
[34:41] in the book of uh in the message
[34:44] Revelation chapter four ahora now
[34:50] there's one way to get into the body
[34:53] how's this body control look brothers
[34:58] look if you pay attention to this is
[35:01] why we're struggling
[35:03] because the devil goes in he enters
[35:08] why couldn't he go into Nehemiah why
[35:16] knew himself
[35:18] and you also have to know yourself
[35:21] to see how you're going to react he has
[35:24] a look
[35:26] now how is his body control
[35:29] now watch this real close and get your
[35:33] pencils ready
[35:37] here's the get on this side that goes
[35:40] into the body this is
[35:42] one two three four five
[35:47] now if the prophet's telling us
[35:50] it's for a purpose it's important it is
[35:54] important that
[35:56] we see this
[36:00] now the first grader was over here is La
[36:02] Vista it's the site
[36:05] smell in here and I like the hearing
[36:08] because Nehemiah he heard
[36:14] he didn't see
[36:16] usted
[36:18] we're here
[36:24] because we didn't even get to see
[36:26] brother Brandon but we here
[36:30] we're here
[36:37] and according to Luke Brothers
[36:40] the prophet says
[36:42] Dominion
[36:45] is when you control yourself
[36:48] your temper
[36:51] I mean
[36:52] that explodes my mind
[36:57] when self-control is so simple
[37:01] when you're able to control your mouth
[37:04] you control gossiping
[37:07] down to even gossiping
[37:12] their doors that the devil uses
[37:15] and sometimes
[37:17] we claim to be the bride
[37:20] when we're we're unpreneurs
[37:23] the walls are still down and the devil
[37:27] is entering
[37:35] but we're the bride already
[37:40] that makes me think
[37:42] that my wall
[37:46] it's still it's torn down
[37:49] but today he said like and and
[37:54] it says in the in the days of the voice
[37:56] of the seventh Angels
[38:07] you have to put yourself there brother
[38:16] that go inside of us or that lead to us
[38:22] now
[38:24] we have a soul after that that comes
[38:27] after this
[38:29] he's talking about the external here
[38:32] and inside
[38:35] of you Brothers
[38:39] managed to go the inside and the outside
[38:42] because just simply what you are inside
[38:45] it's where you are outside
[38:53] because that's what's on the inside
[38:56] right El Alma
[39:05] the first one is Imagination
[39:09] conscience Memoria memory
[39:12] reasoning and affection
[39:17] no I like imagination very much
[39:20] because
[39:27] I didn't start to imagine many things
[39:29] that could
[39:30] affected
[39:34] I'm gonna sit down
[39:37] and I'm gonna relax
[39:45] I couldn't imagine that my brothers
[40:11] he's a moral being
[40:14] that's right
[40:18] I can't do everything they need help
[40:26] when we imagined so many dirties
[40:35] thinking wrong of one another
[40:39] that's imaginations
[40:59] directly to the soul and the soul
[41:04] hey
[41:05] here
[41:07] what is this word is
[41:10] the pastor says that the soul is the
[41:14] spirit
[41:18] of the spirit
[41:26] what we speak
[41:28] it is it's what you are
[41:36] we're going to show it
[42:14] his own brethreno
[43:15] we're building
[43:17] little by little
[43:19] that's right
[43:21] it was our bill from one day to the next
[43:25] yeah and I'm going to be closing with
[43:27] this
[43:30] my father
[43:33] he had a garden
[43:38] and I remember I was young
[43:41] and
[43:42] they began to build
[43:45] um
[43:48] you began to build like a fence of some
[43:51] sort
[43:54] got my attention
[43:57] that to be able to protect
[44:01] the Harvest that was on the inside
[44:06] there's a plant over there
[44:12] he had corn he had a lot of them
[44:17] there's a lot of produce
[44:21] and my father he grew that
[44:31] so that the animals wouldn't eat the
[44:33] produce the Harvest
[44:35] and I would like to bring this to us
[44:38] maybe we already overcame in something
[44:43] maybe we could say that we're
[44:45] comfortable in an area
[44:47] but let's take care of what we have
[44:52] because if we don't build up a wall
[44:56] because the war has to be at a certain
[44:58] height
[45:00] because if we leave the wall Too Short
[45:04] they're going to jump over is
[45:07] going to eat your Harvest we're gonna
[45:11] eat it
[45:11] and when you least realize it is you're
[45:16] in church
[45:17] as a trunk as a tree truck without fruit
[45:29] they seem like they just come off wrong
[45:32] to you
[45:34] stop
[45:36] would I care and let's Build That Wall
[45:38] let's build it high
[45:41] well the devil can't do anything to us
[45:44] we're brothers
[45:46] [Music]
[45:52] [Applause]
[45:59] and we went on that was very good
[46:02] how many love God's word
[46:06] let's read together
[46:09] [Music]
[46:11] the book of nemaya
[46:14] yeah
[46:15] we're studying the coming of the Lord
[46:20] today let's begin
[46:23] chapter two
[46:26] verse six
[46:28] Maya 2 6.
[46:39] so learn of God's word together
[46:53] go ahead and the King said unto him and
[46:56] it says in parentheses the queen also
[46:58] sitting by him repeat the queen
[47:02] also sitting by him
[47:51] next time
[48:31] Jesus Christ
[48:34] just as he's done in our time
[48:38] so everything happening in those final
[48:41] days
[48:45] what God is doing in our times
[48:49] a time of restoration
[49:18] not just anyone could have that status
[49:22] it was a very high position
[49:29] they have to be a very trusted
[49:35] forward
[49:44] but as we come to this
[49:49] we find out not only
[49:53] working for this purpose
[49:56] there's another character
[49:58] a woman actually
[50:01] named Esther
[50:03] Tiempo at the same time
[50:10] yes the book of Esther's afternoon
[50:18] chronologically Esther comes before
[50:20] nemaya and today between Entre is
[50:33] a particular story
[50:39] because many have controversy with the
[50:42] Book of Esther much
[50:45] things that sometimes don't make sense
[50:52] one of them is a the Book of Esther
[50:54] never mentions God's name foreign
[51:31] a month
[51:32] Chase Lou in the 20th year as I was
[51:35] intrition the palace
[51:37] where it was nemaya where was
[51:45] that was the capital of the Kingdom
[51:48] Now read Esther one one is
[51:53] the book afternoon
[51:56] Esther 1-1 they say
[52:11] this is asterisk that range from India
[52:14] even to Ethiopia over 107 and 20
[52:18] provinces
[52:27] when King sat on the throne of his
[52:30] kingdom which was in shushin the palace
[52:32] now where was Esther
[52:37] because all of the Book of Esther
[52:38] happens
[52:39] yes
[52:53] they're both around the same time
[52:59] Pueblo
[53:59] save the people of Israel to save his
[54:02] people
[54:08] I want to give more details
[54:12] but we're speaking of the same place
[54:16] now maybe a little different in times
[54:20] historians possibly
[54:26] josefo
[54:59] good some historians as Josephus and see
[55:02] this
[55:04] say that hazrus was artist Xerxes that
[55:08] he was the same
[55:10] simply a different name
[55:13] so now you see a different picture
[55:16] and the Bible says
[55:24] the queen was by his side
[55:27] and we realize
[55:43] many Jewish Traditions
[55:51] that was beside the king is
[56:00] that Queen Esther was still alive
[56:05] was that artist Xerxes yes
[56:08] whether it be artist Xerxes
[56:11] was a son or familiar or relatives
[56:17] or another son of another wife of a
[56:20] hazardous
[56:23] either way they on you
[56:27] Esther was Queen for a long time
[56:37] she continues being Queen
[57:01] either way Esther was Queen yes
[57:05] during that time
[57:07] is Xerxes
[58:20] she's not a scholar foreign
[59:19] perdon
[59:34] hello
[59:40] the church is a whole lot like it was
[59:42] the days
[1:00:01] with a crown on her head
[1:00:04] Esther was a type of the church
[1:00:08] those who are ready to come out
[1:00:14] with the sweetness
[1:00:34] implements
[1:01:52] our Lord
[1:01:55] that's right
[1:02:02] but in the beginning
[1:02:08] she didn't understand what she was
[1:02:10] called for
[1:02:13] foreign
[1:02:45] cuando a man when
[1:02:48] a malachite
[1:02:51] gave in order
[1:02:53] to kill all the Jews
[1:03:03] Ezra in the second Pole
[1:03:06] in Babylonia the Jews that were in
[1:03:09] babies
[1:03:14] not Babylon anymore
[1:03:19] they were going to kill them
[1:03:23] and this time Mordecai notices
[1:03:29] that was in Persia
[1:03:31] is
[1:03:35] he finds out and sends word to the queen
[1:03:39] that all the Jews would be killed did he
[1:03:42] say is
[1:03:50] King Esther said in first Queen Esther
[1:03:52] said in verse
[1:04:15] and the people of the king's provinces
[1:04:17] do know that whosoever whether man or
[1:04:19] woman shall come unto the king into the
[1:04:21] inner core who is not called there is
[1:04:24] one lot of his to put him to death
[1:04:26] except search to whom the king shall
[1:04:28] hold out a golden scepter that he may
[1:04:30] live but I have not been called to come
[1:04:33] into in unto the king these 30 days
[1:04:46] they were going to kill them all
[1:04:48] celebrities
[1:05:25] Must Die
[1:05:27] foreign
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:27] so this Kingdom for such a time is this
[1:06:42] yes
[1:07:34] that she says I'll do it
[1:07:38] into the king's chamber yeah foreign
[1:08:38] foreign
[1:08:50] [Applause]
[1:09:33] foreign
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:10:37] [Music]
[1:11:07] we all know it
[1:12:02] certain places
[1:12:27] she defended foreign
[1:13:28] about the seals
