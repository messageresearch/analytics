[21:16] apocalypses to the book of revelation
[21:18] capitola
[21:19] chapter 2.
[21:21] verse 1.
[21:27] if you know your bible
[21:34] you'll find out we'll be reading from
[21:36] the ephesian church
[21:42] we've gone over the ephesian church age
[21:44] before uh
[21:47] since we're beginning the small groups
[21:53] we're going to be doing a summary over
[21:55] those ages against
[22:00] don't worry we're not going to last as
[22:01] long as we have previously um
[22:08] there's going to they're going to be
[22:09] much shorter summaries
[22:29] these things said he that holded the
[22:31] seven stars in his right hand who walk
[22:33] it in the midst of the seven golden
[22:34] candlesticks
[22:47] i know thy works and i labor and thy
[22:49] patience and how thou canst not bear
[22:51] them which are evil and thou has tried
[22:54] them which say the apostles and they're
[22:55] not and has found them liars
[23:06] and it has borne and has patience and
[23:09] for my namesake has labored and has not
[23:11] fainted
[23:16] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[23:18] thee because thou has left i first love
[23:32] remember therefore from once thou art
[23:34] fallen and repent and do the first works
[23:37] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[23:39] and will remove thy candlestick out of
[23:41] his place
[23:42] except thou repent
[23:44] what's on that let us pray
[23:46] senor jesus christ lord jesus christ
[23:49] we come before you
[23:52] asking of your mercy
[23:54] and grace
[23:59] as we come upon thy word nosotros
[24:02] no somos
[24:29] amen amen
[24:41] with us once again yes then
[25:07] like it's been quite a bit of days since
[25:08] i haven't seen you here
[25:12] i'm happy to be here
[25:26] alongside his wife
[25:32] the lord blessed him and helped him um
[25:37] i'm sure we will see them here very soon
[25:39] ah so look at
[25:59] then i want to focus on what on the
[26:00] special services that will be this
[26:02] weekend
[26:07] let's take a little bit on the word of
[26:09] god
[26:13] i just want to focus on verse 4 and
[26:15] verse 5.
[26:19] says nevertheless i have someone against
[26:20] you because thou has left thy first love
[26:33] now one of the things i want to i want
[26:35] you to take notice on this age is
[26:48] it's the beginning of the christian uh
[26:51] church
[26:58] the christian church the gentile church
[27:00] had just been born established
[27:03] it was it was a new pena
[27:21] have been witnesses of the lord jesus
[27:22] christ himself cinembargo
[27:25] but even but even then
[27:30] they they had fallen
[27:32] yeah
[27:40] i asked myself how much much more us in
[27:43] in the seventh church age um
[28:14] and he has given us so much
[28:17] less but how easy it is
[28:21] brothers how easy it is
[28:26] how easy it is
[28:28] to forget
[28:42] he takes
[28:48] [Applause]
[28:55] it's been 10 years
[29:00] we came with marcos
[29:02] fort collins to the city of fort collins
[29:08] through a dream and and the guidance of
[29:10] god
[29:36] um
[29:48] there was not a church here
[29:51] oh yeah there was
[30:05] god has never left us
[30:33] we are so busy many times
[30:38] yeah we can't do a whole lot for god
[30:40] brother
[30:43] but i i want to remind you
[30:48] what god has done for us
[30:50] in these 10 years
[30:54] done very much
[30:57] for our church
[31:01] for each and every one of our families
[31:28] the things god has delivered us from
[31:43] because it's easy for the devil to try
[31:45] and take them away
[31:47] to forget
[31:50] what god has has done in my life
[31:53] god has done all for us
[31:58] god has done
[32:21] i don't deserve what god has done for me
[32:41] it's easy to forget about it
[32:44] why we actually do it
[32:49] it becomes a routine to us
[32:54] we come to a church in a very routine
[32:56] way
[32:57] but brother branham says
[33:01] in the the sardisian churches
[33:05] preaching twelve nine of 1960
[33:12] the first church age was the ephesian
[33:13] church age
[33:17] from 1855 to 170. pablo fuel estrella
[33:22] es
[33:25] paul being the star and it was the first
[33:27] church age
[33:32] works without love was god's complaint
[33:35] viga obras say works
[33:37] without love
[33:39] what's god's
[33:40] complaint
[33:46] now i want to focus a little bit on that
[33:48] number uno number one
[34:40] [Music]
[35:02] what's my objective okay
[35:04] that they would see me
[35:07] and english in the spotlight to be in
[35:09] the in the limelight in uh
[35:27] that's what god tells me
[35:31] you know when i stand up here yo
[35:35] i gotta i have to check myself
[35:39] because uh there are times
[35:55] the preachers have that to have that
[35:56] temptation
[36:10] now i'm going
[37:20] with love las cosas
[37:23] so things change brothers
[37:28] i have to ask myself that question
[37:32] how am i doing what i am doing
[37:54] [Music]
[37:58] when you come and do it and you do it
[37:59] just like anything else
[38:16] and then doing
[38:19] [Music]
[38:56] most precious thing that god
[39:11] and what would i be
[39:17] to come in and treat you
[39:20] like you were just anything great man
[39:24] i am wrong
[39:40] falls upon
[39:48] [Music]
[40:21] without love
[40:36] i want to
[41:02] i want to do things with love
[41:48] remember therefore from whence downward
[41:50] fallen and repent and do the first works
[41:56] now look
[41:58] the problem wasn't
[42:11] that was not the problem
[42:18] the problem was that they were doing it
[42:20] without love
[42:22] so then god tells them
[42:25] to go back
[42:26] and do it
[42:28] once again
[42:41] but this time i just look on that one do
[42:45] it with love
[42:49] do it a different eva
[42:52] and you'll have different results
[43:05] believe we haven't always done things
[43:06] with love yes
[43:24] to say lord
