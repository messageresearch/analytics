worship amen not only is this place called the house of worship i don't believe we come here because we think we're better than anyone else amen and before i start anything i'd like to call into his holy presence because what the worship does i believe amen standing bless us tonight amen amen so let us pray gracious loving god [Music] would love to better their relationship with you be more intimate with you make their personal relationship with you [Music] and lord now i ask that you put myself aside lord cause man's word can fail but our mighty god's word can never fail you have something prepared for them your holy name your word lord amen amen and i'm gonna keep you standing for one a little bit more please open up to the book of job i'd like to thank my god once again for this opportunity and my pastor for allowing me to use his pulpit putting the desire in his heart amen to allow me to speak to his people because god should have already came i believe but thanks be by his grace he's giving us more time amen and the word of god says and the lord said unto satan which cometh thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it responds [Music] and the lord said unto satan has thou considered my servant job that there is none like him on in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth god and excu with evil hope then answered the lord and said did you fear god for not responding [Music] and then if we can quickly go to psalms 37 39 amen but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their strength in the time of trouble amen and reading this scripture psalms 37. i think i read that i think a hundred times to myself i read at least 100 times to myself and the more i read it the more i saw how great my goddess what he has in him for me because when we look at the parts of the scripture that says [Music] he is their strength in the time of trouble when i look at that and i put myself there when i was in my troubled times when i was times in dark times it made me start to ask myself that it's not only any type of strength in which god has no solamente but it's needed is necessary of a that's no like any other strength strength amen we find ourselves in trouble many of the times yeah it's the darkest moment in our lives and we find ourselves in the bottom of the pits [Music] worthless [Music] when we're there many of the times we feel god can never forgive us but thanks be to god for this beautiful promise he has given us in his word he has given a strength for that believer in troubled times amen i believe that's for you and for me to take off because it's neither of a supernatural strength is necessary not only to bring us out of our trouble but but many times we've been told here at church but many times we have the trouble i'm not forgiving our own self strength in which god has for us helps us not only come out of our trouble except [Applause] [Music] and many times we have been given many promises [Music] and many times we forget about them but the only way to know or remember those promises in which god has given you and me is to go to his word because that's what he has given us today used over there against the devil in the desert amen i believe there's many [Applause] there it's right there that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life and i don't know if that's a promise but i believe that's a promise amen but whoever believes the devil likes to block us away from those beautiful promises from god depending on the situation whether you feel him or not he's always there many times god is always trying to reveal to us that he wants for us and tonight before i get ahead of myself uh the title in which i have to announce the subjects with my brother felix tonight america felix praying to god that he'd be using us to share this i believe brings purpose amen i want to ask you all a question who likes trouble here of the year our teachers would give us tests just to see where we were at many times we were never ready for those tests we never knew what was going to be on it [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] although it sounds very simple or very obvious the question is but i have asked myself why am i going through it why did this happen to me because i say or i try to justify myself by saying i come to church every wednesday friday and saturday that we could see god [Music] working in our lives it's through the trouble i want you to open up your mind a little bit tonight and i'm gonna simplify this as best i can [Applause] if there was nothing ever to be saved [Music] how can god be a restorer in your life and remember i said trouble brings purpose amen and i say how would we ever see the purpose inside let me tell you bro there's nothing that happens in your life [Music] [Applause] of the world [Music] sorry forgive me brother i know my redeemer liveth he says it was god's divine plan to do so if i and if we were go ahead and if we were put here for a purpose he says then there is nothing then there's nothing can destroy us until god's purpose is fulfilled [Music] nothing can harm us [Music] no matter how much trouble we have how much heartache sorrow that we go through all of these are reasons and there's a what god has purposed in his heart to bring past there is no demon there is no power there is nothing can ever separate god's great immortal eternal plan [Applause] i still have the audacity to ask the question why am i still going through this thing i thought god loved me i thought i thought god was all love peace and joy all the time but if we go to proverbs 3 3 chapter 12 he says for whom we must go running and tonight i'm going to show you with a little testimony in one point in my life i remember in high school training classes in my desire truly in high school for the incorrect reasons [Music] i i thought having the best body you know what it would make me the greatest person ever little by little i started really getting into bodybuilding i started really sculpting my body like those great bodybuilders you see i started taking certain proteins certain things that i should have never all those things that i thought would help me better my body and it helped me lose weight faster yeah and that took me to even more things yes and the deeper i got more into that the more i saw myself separating myself from god because many of the times as young people we have certain goals we have certain plans in our life we want to reach trouble in my life [Music] for him before the foundation of the world although god is wanting more than anything to show you that it has a perfect plan made for you yeah what you were meant to do [Music] i would have never known that he was with me i would have never needed him in my time because after porque es pues after a while kept on working out and doing things it was on my mother's birthday where we were going where we went to the store [Applause] [Music] and in the car the other car flipped over [Music] [Music] i had like a i was doing skull crushers like they call them [Music] it the knowledge that i forgot from bodybuilding the shoulders are one of the most precious things that you can have and again i see more than ever masking because he wants to prove okay and show the enemy he has something in us that he can't take away before the foundation of the earth oh thank you god as this time i'll be giving the place to my brother felix and if we can take tonight even though you're failing time after time after time there's a true purpose for it you just must pray to god he revealed that to you he shall god bless you god bless each and every one of you tonight i don't know can you hear me uh if you can please stand for a vibration uh troubles bring preparation problems drain of proposito and they have a purpose behind it if you can open your scripture to the first book of jeremiah chapter verse 5 before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou cometh forth out of the womb i sent sanctified thee and ordained thee a prophet into the nations antis lugar you know he he asked me do you want to preach and i told him sure you know something that brother fidel was talking about you know he was talking about joe yes and you know how and and and i just want to just just overview it you know when when job he was a great man and and he he was very blessed but god took everything away from him you know and and and and the devil told god you know you're you're you're gonna he's gonna curse you you know but you know but job stayed firm it didn't matter if everything was taken away from him you know he is you know when god comes and he takes things away from us you know some of the things that we may thought we may have for a long time you know that they were going to be around us for a long time you know we're going to have this job for a long time you know it's you know he takes things away from us and we're there it's almost like and we're like why is this happening to me why god [Music] [Music] there is nothing you know sometimes god lets tests and trouble come to us you know you know he he lets that happen to us sometimes i believe your crew you know if if we didn't maybe didn't have those troubles you know we we wouldn't take notice on how blessed we are everything that god has done for us everything that god is doing for us you know we we wouldn't we wouldn't we wouldn't take notice in it you know our life would have just been so simple i want to read this this quote from and remember no matter how great the distress is it is you you know so he so you can have more fellowship with god more in your life there is nothing that can stop that noise [Applause] [Applause] he knew what you as a person was capable of [Music] but we need that seed to grow when have you noticed that they're there something beautiful hasn't grown until there has been dirt on it you know there has to be dirt on it so you know sometimes we just need a little dirt in our life so it can help us develop you know because dirt has the fertilizer it has a nutrient that new that nutrient that helps you push through this is nutrients to push through the dirt so you can grow so you can grow into something beautiful work works is faith expressed now here now here is a predestinated plan in plain view prepared beforehand if you sowed a scene and just threw it out there on the ground it i can't
