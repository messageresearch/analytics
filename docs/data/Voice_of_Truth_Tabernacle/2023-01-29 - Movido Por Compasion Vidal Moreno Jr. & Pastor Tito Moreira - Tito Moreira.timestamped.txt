[31:00] [Music]
[31:42] [Music]
[31:46] of the coming of the Lord yeah
[31:50] um
[31:54] we'll be doing a short prayer before uh
[31:57] starting our sermon
[32:00] Celestial Heavenly Father
[32:02] give you thanks Lord
[32:05] for the girl you've been with us
[32:09] we ask you to bless the service

[32:20] in the same manner the ears of the ears
[32:27] may we live better than how we came in
[32:31] yes
[32:33] glorify your name
[32:37] you have preeminence
[32:40] of our assistance
[32:43] Lord we give you thanks for everything
[32:47] I saw this in the name Lord Jesus Christ
[32:49] amen amen
[32:55] chapter 1 verse 3 reads
[33:10] and they said unto me the remnant that
[33:13] are left of the Captivity there in the
[33:15] province are in great Affliction and
[33:17] reproach the wall of Jerusalem also is
[33:19] broken down and the gates thereof are
[33:21] burnt with fire
[33:23] estas is
[33:33] and it came to a past when I heard these
[33:35] words that I sat down and wept and more
[33:37] on certain days and fasted and prayed
[33:39] before the god of Heaven
[33:42] I'll read one more scripture
[33:47] you can turn to Matthew chapter 9.
[33:51] and we'll be reading verse 36 to 38.
[33:57] here our Lord Jesus Christ speaks to us
[34:07] Matthew 9 36 DC
[34:11] is
[34:21] but when he saw the multitude
[34:25] but when he saw the multitudes he was
[34:27] moved with compassion on them because
[34:28] they fainted and were scattered abroad
[34:31] as sheep having no Shepherd and tons is
[34:39] unto his disciples the Harvest truly as
[34:41] planets but the laborers are few
[34:48] pray therefore the lord of the Harvest
[34:50] that he will send forth laborers into
[34:52] his Harvest
[34:54] you may be seated Brothers
[34:57] for a title uh
[35:01] our pastor alongside myself
[35:04] we've decided to title um
[35:07] our message moved by compassion amen
[35:11] amen
[35:14] find out in the Maya uh
[35:19] noticias he received the news
[35:25] Jerusalem of how the people of Jerusalem
[35:27] are doing uh um
[35:31] and the conditions they live in
[35:36] is
[35:38] we see this new series
[35:50] I believe sometimes when we hear bad
[35:52] news
[36:01] you don't really pay too much attention
[36:03] to those things
[36:05] I think it's happened to all of us
[36:09] we want to ignore the situations
[36:25] foreign
[37:34] [Music]
[37:51] [Music]
[38:01] is slow
[38:03] amen
[39:03] amen
[39:05] yes
[39:09] [Music]
[39:12] to take action
[39:15] s
[39:19] because God gave a great position to
[39:22] Nehemiah
[39:23] um
[39:26] the ray of the king and Don says
[39:33] so when you read the scriptures uh uh
[39:48] was uh take it easier
[39:52] he was in a good position
[39:58] he actually didn't know the people in
[40:01] captivity
[40:05] but something did not let him stay idle
[40:09] amen amen
[40:12] that thing in his heart
[40:17] give him peace amen amen
[40:20] and I believe
[40:25] is a compassion if we do not have that
[40:28] compassion
[40:29] if there is no compassion in us
[40:32] there won't be an effort no no no no
[40:35] other Cambio there won't be a change
[40:38] that's why there's people okay
[40:41] motivate for us get motivated for a
[40:43] season
[40:45] they're just motivated
[40:57] that takes them leads them to take
[40:59] action
[41:00] that's what I believe
[41:03] that's why people
[41:07] cannot live a Christian Life
[41:10] and have success
[41:13] so you don't have that weight in their
[41:16] hearts
[41:22] I was actually streaming
[41:31] and how is it that this is something
[41:35] compassion
[41:38] towards the people is
[41:43] that leads you to take or make an effort
[41:47] foreign
[42:39] my honor today as my father he says
[42:50] when we went to school
[42:53] I am firmly against drinking
[43:02] I remember reading of a man that was
[43:04] born a hundred miles from me
[43:08] a hundred years difference in a little
[43:10] Log Cabin
[43:12] Abraham Lincoln his name was Abraham
[43:15] Lincoln
[43:18] one of the greatest man Kentucky ever
[43:20] produced to my opinion the Abraham
[43:22] Lincoln cuando says
[43:26] and when Abraham Lincoln when he got off
[43:28] off the boat of the boat down in New
[43:31] Orleans Zoo
[43:36] he's seen them auction some color people
[43:39] off as a slave
[43:41] um
[43:44] a big heavy man is
[43:49] poor little wife and children standing
[43:52] out crying
[43:54] him like cattle
[44:00] to bigger heavier women to make better
[44:02] slaves he's a Lincoln Lincoln
[44:07] as many of you know in the history
[44:15] when he folded his hands and smacked
[44:18] them together and said
[44:20] that's wrong
[44:22] and by the help of God
[44:25] if it takes my life
[44:32] and he did amen amen
[44:38] it was something that impacted in La
[44:42] Villa the Abraham Lincoln Abraham
[44:44] Lincoln's life
[44:46] the impact was so great okay
[44:50] that it took him to take an action
[45:03] because I believe when God gave him the
[45:05] privilege to be the president
[45:09] I believe this was one of the reasons
[45:12] for which uh
[46:11] that ego
[46:14] foreign
[47:48] that's the plane
[48:10] the children of God matters
[48:25] but I believe
[48:30] are born again
[48:35] God
[48:37] is
[48:39] places the right motive
[48:42] is
[48:45] and I believe that's what he's done in
[48:47] this
[48:48] [Music]
[48:55] we're all here together
[49:00] working together
[49:02] with a purpose
[49:05] so glorify our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[49:08] amen
[49:09] that's why we are here
[49:13] that's why we couldn't stay where we
[49:15] used to because
[49:16] God calls us
[49:20] in California
[49:38] and I believe
[49:44] they affect this news had on him
[49:48] took him
[49:49] to prayer in French
[49:55] the difference I saw between Elijah and
[49:58] Amaya
[49:59] is
[50:01] Elijah thought he was the last one
[50:05] there was um
[50:07] that would believe as he did Maya
[50:13] corazones
[51:11] that's the reason God can't get a hold
[51:14] of Hearts is because that man won't let
[51:16] him
[51:19] you got your life all choked up with
[51:22] something else
[51:23] some kind of organizations
[51:32] well they got a Revival down at the
[51:34] Methodist or Baptists
[51:38] oh that's not my church
[51:41] I don't go down there he says he says
[51:45] sure
[51:47] you're a member of that tree it is
[51:51] every man that's born again of the
[51:53] spirit of God is
[51:55] a member of the body of Christ amen
[52:00] every man that's born of the spirit of
[52:03] God
[52:06] has that kind of motive towards his
[52:08] Christian Brothers foreign
[52:14] in little bitty things
[52:16] but what difference does that make
[52:21] that doesn't matter
[52:24] the little differences
[52:30] if we can agree or be in one Accord on
[52:33] Jesus Christ we're brothers that's what
[52:37] he says
[52:40] we press on
[52:43] even in families
[52:48] sometimes a husband and wife do not
[52:50] agree
[52:51] that doesn't mean
[53:12] you need a trip to God's altar to get
[53:14] right with God he said
[53:20] well they're down at the church of the
[53:22] open door I belong to the Baptist Church
[53:29] no need me going down there praying for
[53:31] rain he says
[53:34] don't do that if you do
[53:38] you'll never get rained
[53:42] you're close to Heavens again
[53:45] yes sir amen amen
[54:52] uh
[55:30] I keep chill he fled after killing an
[55:33] Egyptian but on this Quest I I ye but
[55:36] after in the desert
[55:41] God started to work with him
[55:45] starts the process
[55:47] of the return
[55:51] because God had to work with him
[55:56] action
[55:58] he took action he took action
[56:01] but it wasn't the right one
[56:05] when you have a calling brother
[56:09] God won't leave you alone
[56:14] [Music]
[56:22] so God takes you uh
[56:25] for you to do your part
[56:27] any one of us here
[56:32] we must have a similar weight
[56:35] that's what I believe
[56:37] similar way
[56:50] because when the Israelites
[56:53] when they were given twice the work
[57:04] so if you have that same way
[57:06] don't complain
[57:09] just carry your clothes
[57:17] God works
[57:24] not just for yourself
[57:26] but for God
[57:30] leave the place
[57:32] God bless you
[57:36] yeah man
[57:39] Mateo Capital Tres you 23 basically
[57:44] verse 37 Mateo Matthew 23 verse 37.
[57:53] when Jesus spoke these words yeah
[57:59] yeah
[58:03] he spoke to the Pharisees his disciples
[58:05] Jerusalem Israel
[58:10] how many times
[58:12] he sent them prophets
[58:16] and how many times
[58:20] he said since righteous Abel hasta
[58:24] Zacharias
[58:26] how many members
[58:34] and the temple
[58:48] oh Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that kills
[58:51] the prophets and stone is them which are
[58:53] sent unto thee cuantas versus
[59:03] how often would I have gathered thy
[59:06] children together even as a hand
[59:07] gathereth her chickens under her wings
[59:09] and ye would not
[59:14] Libro is a book
[59:18] about Unity
[59:22] when we see these walls being built
[59:25] they're the walls of Jerusalem
[59:28] God sends them together
[1:00:07] your enemy keeps infiltrating himself is
[1:00:13] not with one purpose
[1:00:24] as God tells Jerusalem
[1:00:27] how many times I wanted to gather you
[1:00:32] repeat God wants to gather again
[1:00:35] okay like if you believe it
[1:00:38] is
[1:00:41] your neighbor God wants to gather us
[1:00:45] now when Jesus says
[1:00:49] he was moved by compassion
[1:00:54] as David wept Jesus Jesus
[1:01:12] Jesus
[1:01:14] did the same thing at this moment
[1:01:18] we have the privilege to go to the same
[1:01:20] time
[1:01:21] I saw the entire city of Jerusalem
[1:01:35] Jerusalem
[1:01:37] how many times
[1:02:36] what does
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:34] how about the future
[1:04:13] he says how Jesus said these words this
[1:04:16] scripture we just read
[1:04:18] them says
[1:04:22] you know
[1:04:25] as I told you this morning in the
[1:04:26] breakfast
