[22:44] [Music]
[22:54] that's your brothers
[23:01] thank you so much
[23:21] senor
[23:23] a um
[23:28] we're going to be reading in the Book of
[23:30] Joshua chapter 4 24 14 and 15.
[23:34] we give things to our pastor
[23:38] for the trustee has in US
[23:43] believe me that I don't take it lightly
[23:47] it's a great responsibility
[23:52] because one day we're going to be
[23:54] accountable for what we speak
[23:56] each and every one of us Josue
[24:01] 24
[24:03] 14-15c it reads like this
[24:13] now therefore free the Lord and serve
[24:16] him with sincerity and in truth is
[24:26] and put away from among you the gods
[24:29] whom your father served on the other
[24:30] side of the river and in Egypt and
[24:32] served Jehovah
[24:34] 15 says like this
[24:36] foreign
[24:58] choose for yourself say whom you will
[25:01] serve whether to the gods whom your
[25:02] father served when they were across the
[25:04] river or to the gods of the amorites in
[25:06] whose land you dwell but as for me in my
[25:08] house we will serve the Lord
[25:13] this morning
[25:20] that you come into control of me
[25:24] if you take control of the audience
[25:32] just one word in their hearts
[25:38] that there be able to be a change and
[25:40] that we'd be able to leave this place
[26:03] in my house will serve the Lord
[26:10] our pastor spoke to us about this eight
[26:13] days ago and he said this
[26:17] he says I love Joshua's words
[26:21] when he unites his family and says
[26:26] I in my house will serve the Lord
[26:30] pastor says I love it
[26:33] when he says those words
[26:37] because he shows leadership
[26:41] and this is the key here Brothers
[26:44] he's showing leadership
[27:32] not taking the position of someone else
[27:35] [Music]
[27:39] and he says and it shows that he at his
[27:42] house were in agreement
[27:46] he was not forcing his home
[27:50] he was not at odds with his home
[27:53] um
[27:55] I was thinking a little bit
[27:58] personal on my personal life
[28:04] this morning
[28:08] if you want to live better or if you
[28:11] want to live worse
[28:12] this is an election
[28:16] for you
[28:18] there was a choice
[28:21] yesterday to prepare
[28:24] to come with expectations
[28:27] see something from God
[28:45] there's someone greater than Canada
[28:54] so happy because I'm on that side on The
[28:58] Winning Side
[29:00] now you have the choice
[29:05] to go and do bad things
[29:09] to come today
[29:15] to watch the fight don't misunderstand
[29:18] you know your conditions
[29:46] what do you want for yourself
[30:14] maybe you put yourself in that position
[30:28] I myself put myself in that position
[30:34] activities
[30:42] [Music]
[31:16] I need to show my children
[31:21] unity in the in the children
[31:24] that's what's being spoken about right
[31:27] and this this is
[31:35] because it's going to help us
[31:38] not everything in life is is difficult
[31:41] or easy
[31:43] foreign
[33:05] you choose them for me
[33:16] so they can see it
[33:20] is foreign
[34:12] that's why I put myself in service
[34:17] because I love him
[34:20] because he's giving me so much
[34:25] I believe he's also giving you a lot
[34:29] there's no words foreign
[34:49] the only thing you can do is put
[34:51] yourself in service to him
[35:16] they affected us
[35:19] look
[35:53] and acceptance
[36:24] amen Brothers
[36:27] you're too quiet Brothers
[36:32] don't tell me that you all stayed up
[36:34] late to watch the fight
[36:39] who won and who lost
[36:45] it's okay
[36:48] who won
[36:51] that's good Brothers
[36:54] Mexicans right a man
[36:59] you know one of the things
[37:01] this message has taught me
[37:34] in the middle
[37:50] just maintain in the middle
[37:54] says
[37:55] so then
[37:57] the choices we make in our lives
[38:02] look Brothers if you want to be
[38:04] bitterness forgive me
[38:08] I want to be a bitter Christian then you
[38:11] will be a bitter
[38:18] Christianity
[38:26] and no one is
[38:28] the only one that's going to hold you
[38:30] back is yourselves
[38:36] you're going to send your own self to
[38:38] hell oh oh heavy condios or or
[38:44] keep up okay with God
[38:47] you yourself you're gonna choose
[38:52] just as you had to prepare yes
[39:11] you need to encourage yourself
[39:15] don't wait for it for someone else you
[39:19] need to encourage yourself
[39:20] you tell yourself
[39:23] [Applause]
[39:36] it
[39:37] [Applause]
[39:38] [Music]
[39:43] has to to be manifested
[39:48] I say it by experience
[39:54] because me and my youth
[39:57] I made a lot of bad decisions
[40:00] just as many of you
[40:03] is
[40:05] perhaps has affected
[40:07] affected you later
[40:09] sometimes
[40:13] we make right now they're going to
[40:16] affect you later
[40:22] if you choose the incorrect words
[40:29] because you can't preach something that
[40:31] you're not living yes sir
[40:40] it's impossible
[40:43] yo yo yo yo yo
[40:45] me myself
[40:49] you have to sanctify yourself
[40:52] to give life to others
[40:56] want our children to have life
[41:00] how do we want to get our children
[41:02] together
[41:03] if I'm dead
[41:26] your creator
[41:32] I was all sick yesterday
[41:38] it wasn't a strong pain it was just more
[41:40] of a pain though it hurt me kind of here
[41:43] in the center
[41:45] and I just felt bad brothers
[41:48] my throat was hurting don't worry it's
[41:52] not covered
[41:54] I was about to call the pastor brother
[41:57] text message him
[42:22] it continues hurting
[42:34] you can see yourself in the last book of
[42:37] life oh no or not
[43:37] the choices that you made today
[44:12] and they told them that hey come and
[44:14] help us find the the ammonites
[44:22] and he they told him if you come and
[44:24] help us and help us win then you'll be
[44:26] our governor but here's the detail
[44:28] Brothers
[44:30] accepted
[44:33] before going to
[44:36] Wario
[44:38] and he prayed
[44:40] oh and he said
[44:43] look at what he promised God
[44:46] when you're under the anointing
[44:49] watch what you say that's what you said
[44:55] don't allow just to any kind of worship
[44:57] your mouth and he said
[45:02] if you give me the victory
[45:05] the first person
[45:08] coming back
[45:10] I will give it as a sacrifice to you
[45:14] didn't think Brothers
[45:23] we don't think about what we say
[45:26] s
[45:29] when you promised God you're going to
[45:31] serve him every day of your life and
[45:33] what happened
[45:35] is
[45:37] that condition the way it is
[45:43] if we're supposed to be foreign
[45:49] foreign
[47:03] [Music]
[47:44] amen fathers
[47:49] when you decide to be a parent
[47:53] you choose to suffer
[47:55] Ed
[47:57] especially when they get sick
[48:00] we're new parents and they get sick or
[48:03] we we worry a lot
[48:05] and there he was
[48:09] he tore his clothes
[48:14] and he knew Brothers
[48:18] he had to fulfill his word
[48:29] because he was under the anointing
[48:36] you have not have made a bad decision
[48:44] he said
[48:50] you yourself have come to be the cause
[48:52] of my pain
[48:55] because I've given the word to my Lord
[48:59] this morning have you given one day have
[49:02] you one day given your word to God
[49:05] I don't hear not one amen
[49:08] I have
[49:10] um
[49:14] here I am
[49:18] when you're close to death
[49:23] makes you speak when they're almost
[49:25] about to throw you in the heart
[49:27] everything's okay
[49:30] your nail doesn't even know
[49:32] why am I gonna go to church
[49:35] what am I going to go do at church
[49:40] there's a bunch of sick people at church
[49:45] well where else are the sick people
[49:46] going to be then at church
[49:51] the sick people need a doctor
[49:56] yeah
[49:57] sometimes we don't want to come to
[49:58] church
[49:59] because it's filled with hypocrites
[50:04] when you do this
[50:08] you show me that you're poor in spirit
[50:24] you're fighting with the brothers
[50:28] amen amen
[50:33] let's just be be aware of what we speak
[50:36] watch what we say
[50:37] destination sometimes we misinterpret
[50:40] predestination and brother Brandon says
[50:43] this is
[50:45] the message where I think Pentecost
[50:47] failed
[50:53] now in verse 5 the word predestinances
[51:00] it's not a good for a good word
[51:04] as it kind of confuses people
[51:12] when you see predestined predestinence
[51:15] speaks looks back to foreknowledge and
[51:51] for knowledge
[51:56] how could God predestine someone
[51:58] it is yours he's God
[52:01] he knows
[52:04] what choice you were going to make today
[52:06] in this day
[52:07] the beginnings and the end
[52:11] that you were gonna you're gonna you're
[52:14] gonna hate it
[52:16] how is it that he could have hated
[52:18] and how could he have loved Jacob
[52:53] you're gonna choose him
[52:56] you're gonna choose him
[53:03] I'm just going on the surface
[53:09] and he says in other words God didn't
[53:11] say look
[53:13] I'll make this man be this is
[53:16] not make this man be that
[53:19] you choose
[53:21] you choose
[53:27] don't trust your your instinct that says
[53:30] oh God already progesterated
[53:34] Destiny in my life
[53:39] if God predestined you then you're going
[53:41] to keep my daughter you're going to
[53:43] March because you're going to be the
[53:45] example how with your life
[54:06] to the hole
[54:10] sometimes we're good at preaching
[54:15] what about my children
[54:20] what about my wife
[54:32] if your wife doesn't support you then
[54:34] what
[54:36] imagine Brothers
[54:42] wouldn't be the way she is
[54:51] God bless them wherever they are
[54:55] they say
[54:56] yes
[54:58] he had to know the beginning and the end
[55:04] so because he knew beforehand he could
[55:08] say
[55:10] this will happen in this other will
[55:13] happen
[55:14] because it was God
[55:18] he knew where everything would be placed
[55:26] certain things
[55:29] for certain ages
[55:31] do you believe that is
[55:35] that's certainly scriptural wow wow and
[55:40] don't says so then
[55:43] don't just stay seated on the bench
[55:45] Brothers
[55:46] I know that the bench is very
[55:48] comfortable and I know that being a
[55:50] leader is not easy it's not easy
[55:56] because one has to keep moving forward
[56:00] anyone has to put the example you have
[56:02] to put the example
[56:04] and that's where things begin to tie up
[56:07] that's when things begin to tighten up
[56:55] foreign later
[57:09] no brothers and when we get to church we
[57:11] don't say anything
[57:14] we're quiet no
[57:19] you don't know God help us Brothers I
[57:23] believe I believe we're Christians here
[57:24] yeah
[57:26] on the streets and wherever we're at
[57:29] look Brothers
[57:31] I believe
[57:33] you and I have to come to this condition
[57:36] that the people
[57:38] that they'll be able to see us
[57:42] there is a disciple of Jesus
[57:45] that's what I believe
[57:48] we haven't been able to do that yet
[57:52] we're going to keep working now
[57:54] we're still alive
[57:58] we're not we're not here
[58:07] you make
[58:12] a decision you're going to take
[58:15] um
[58:29] then he came going to a place
[58:35] where we had to make another decision
[58:37] Abraham
[59:24] when you put yourself in those
[59:26] situations
[59:29] remember we're talking about restoring
[59:31] the family okay they say and it says he
[59:35] said
[59:43] then he came to a place where he had to
[59:45] make another decision
[59:46] and that decision foreign
[59:56] or whether he was going to trust God's
[59:58] judgment
[1:00:26] because she looks like she has a long
[1:00:28] skirt on
[1:00:30] maybe she's all covered up
[1:00:33] look this is what he said
[1:00:36] he didn't do that
[1:00:39] physical he didn't say that he is
[1:00:42] if she gives me the drink
[1:00:45] and my camels
[1:00:48] brothers
[1:00:51] so look he said he said
[1:01:08] not me
[1:01:11] that's the key
[1:01:15] Lord
[1:01:17] you made that decision
[1:01:22] a brand new car
[1:01:24] you choose
[1:01:43] as well
[1:01:49] after coming to the door to the gate of
[1:01:51] the city
[1:01:57] was he going to try and take his own
[1:01:59] intelligence to try and choose perhaps
[1:02:10] the most suitable wife for his wife of
[1:02:12] his Masters
[1:02:14] or was he going to use his own judgments
[1:02:23] could you go into town and look around
[1:02:25] and find the most attractive
[1:02:33] would be the best for him
[1:02:38] and I think Eliezer made a great
[1:02:41] decision
[1:02:42] when he said
[1:02:44] that he would trust God
[1:02:49] wait a minute look Brothers
[1:03:00] he wasn't just giving any any job any
[1:03:04] task to fulfille
[1:03:07] was given a very special job
[1:03:12] in this last time this last days
[1:03:19] William Marion Branham
[1:03:22] elvino and he came
[1:03:26] to choose a bride
[1:03:28] to prepare a bride
[1:03:31] yes
[1:03:33] that's why I don't take it lightly to
[1:03:36] come here
[1:03:40] the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:03:43] now here's the detail here's the thing
[1:03:46] you choose if you're going to be a son
[1:03:50] or a daughter of God or or
[1:03:56] if you're not going to be any of that at
[1:03:58] all
[1:04:00] stop blaming God so much it must as a
[1:04:04] matter of fact
[1:04:05] let's let's stop blaming the devil too
[1:04:08] it's true Brothers how many are whips
[1:04:11] did you not fall asleep did you fall
[1:04:14] asleep on me look Brothers
[1:04:18] this is what God placed on my heart
[1:04:21] look at your condition
[1:04:31] don't do it again
[1:04:34] change
[1:04:36] we want results different results
[1:04:41] doing the same decisions making the same
[1:04:43] choices
[1:04:45] the same dumb things we did
[1:04:48] and we want different results
[1:04:50] it's not going to work that way
[1:04:53] if it hasn't worked for you
[1:04:58] and try another strategy We Stand
[1:05:02] Brothers
[1:05:22] of what was spoken
[1:05:25] it wasn't the words
[1:05:28] it was your word
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:06:04] to choose make the right choice
[1:06:08] you decide foreign
[1:06:26] help me choose my wife
[1:06:29] [Music]
[1:06:30] thank you for my wife Lord
[1:06:33] because she helps me
[1:06:36] hey
[1:06:37] she sacrifices herself
[1:06:44] sometimes I want to be with my children
[1:06:48] but you've called us to something
[1:06:51] I've chosen Lord
[1:06:54] chosen the harder the hard work
[1:06:58] just as you placed it on yourself
[1:07:09] [Music]
[1:07:14] because you've chosen this
[1:07:17] not the easy life
[1:07:19] [Music]
[1:07:27] that's what we're hoping in Lord
[1:07:29] trusting it
[1:07:32] [Music]
[1:07:34] when you come in the clouds
[1:07:37] we're going to find ourselves with you
