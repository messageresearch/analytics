[19:09] God bless you guys
[19:14] I have a testimony it's full of
[19:16] testimonies
[19:18] I'll try to keep it short
[19:23] I didn't grow up in church
[19:25] who have been the world so
[19:30] I was established in its ways and
[19:34] desires and
[19:37] that
[19:38] makes you depressed and so I would smoke
[19:44] take medications
[19:49] and um
[19:51] one day I got hit by a car
[19:55] I think I ran over I don't know it just
[19:58] happened
[19:59] and I woke up in the hospital
[20:03] and I earned I injured my left knee
[20:09] is
[20:11] and I was in bed
[20:14] for uh for a while
[20:17] I couldn't get up on my own
[20:22] I couldn't go to work
[20:24] and that made my depression 20 times
[20:27] worse
[20:30] and thank God that I recovered
[20:35] physically
[20:37] but mentally
[20:40] I was in a long season of depression
[20:44] depression
[20:47] I would go to sleep all the time
[20:50] I'd watch the Sun go up and down for
[20:53] long times
[20:58] I would barely need to use the bathroom
[21:00] because well I didn't eat or drink
[21:06] um I was I was literally rotting away
[21:11] and I was okay with that
[21:15] and then one day I had a brother talk to
[21:17] me about the good news of Jesus Christ
[21:23] which such passion and boldness
[21:28] and I didn't understand it but I wanted
[21:30] it
[21:35] and
[21:37] by that time I was smoking every hour
[21:41] a lot of medications that I shouldn't
[21:44] have and
[21:47] I with the faith of a mustard seed I
[21:50] prayed
[21:51] [Music]
[21:52] that I wouldn't stop smoking so that I
[21:55] could be sober yeah
[22:00] and
[22:02] I went from smoking every hour
[22:05] never wanting to again
[22:08] literally overnight
[22:13] and I started coming to church here
[22:17] it was a lot but I knew that I needed
[22:20] more faith
[22:25] um
[22:26] because in one day you India I was gonna
[22:29] take my antidepressant
[22:32] and someone something told me that if I
[22:36] just trust in him
[22:44] and
[22:45] that I was ready only if I was willing
[22:48] to trust
[22:51] and I did and
[22:54] [Music]
[22:56] I mean that's part of why you guys
[22:58] always hear me say it's all mental
[23:03] because well I give glory to God for
[23:06] that because
[23:08] it sometimes it takes you to get down
[23:11] to finally give yourself up
[23:17] and I would have never done that by
[23:19] myself
[23:22] or for myself
[23:29] yeah there's a lot of testimonies and I
[23:31] hope this helps
[23:34] if they think that they can find
[23:36] something out there in the world
[23:42] because I I could always
[23:45] get everything that I had back but okay
[23:49] it was it worth living for
[23:52] eign
[23:58] God bless this church that you guys were
[24:00] there when I needed to find a place
[24:05] and I believe that the word is here
[24:08] so I thank you guys
[24:11] God bless you
[24:14] God bless his name
[24:18] [Applause]

[30:49] chapter 18 verse one please
[30:54] First Kings chapter 18 verse
[30:59] give thanks unto our pastor for allowing
[31:02] me to not only use his pulpitor foreign
[31:11] it says and it comes to Past after many
[31:15] days that the word of the Lord came to
[31:17] Elijah in the third year saying go shoot
[31:20] thyselfs unto Ahab and I will send rain
[31:23] upon the Earth
[31:48] Lord we just give you thanks for your
[31:51] love and mercy tonight
[31:54] we just simply come in a simple mindset
[31:59] a humble mindset Lord
[32:04] not trying to work ourselves through an
[32:07] emotions
[32:10] but be plain and simple
[32:15] we need you
[32:17] I need you that's why I come here
[32:20] tonight
[32:21] I don't come here because I'm perfect
[32:24] I come here because I'm broken come here
[32:28] cause I'm flawed I come here because I
[32:31] am a sinner
[32:32] who recognize that Grace was applied
[32:36] unto my life
[32:37] and that's why I'm here tonight
[32:40] use your vessels put me aside um take
[32:45] control of this body
[32:47] take control of this mind and take
[32:50] control of every body and mind in this
[32:52] place
[32:55] the devil has rights
[33:00] to do anything he can
[33:02] to Rob us from our blessing
[33:06] but it's we also have a right
[33:10] come before you God and claim is the
[33:14] promises that you gave us the overcome
[33:17] this world
[33:18] we ask this in the name of the Lord
[33:20] Jesus Christ
[33:23] amen amen amen
[33:26] I'm a little bit louder than usual is
[33:33] again not trying to build up to an
[33:35] emotion
[33:38] but after reading what God has to say
[33:41] about Elijah
[33:44] about that experience in Mount
[33:47] Carmelo not only about that fire
[33:50] but all the experiences that he had
[33:52] before that
[33:54] it just gets you excited
[33:58] she's just waking something inside
[34:01] [Music]
[34:54] and before I want to say my title yeah
[35:00] without with our beloved pastor
[35:02] pastor we entirely I need a Mount Carmel
[35:06] experience
[35:14] and I read chapter 17 because I want you
[35:18] to know where Elijah was found
[35:21] um
[35:25] before God called them towards Mount
[35:28] Carmel
[35:30] it says that God sent him to to
[35:35] zarephiefs
[35:40] and going into the word
[35:44] in the Greek and El griego it means
[35:48] significa place of refinements
[35:51] please put it up here on the projector
[35:54] it says place of refinements
[35:59] smelting place
[36:02] of purification of fire purification
[36:09] I don't believe God is the god of
[36:12] coincidence
[36:14] got out of purpose of the reason why
[36:18] he said it's His prophets to this
[36:21] certain place
[36:23] before this great encounter in Mount
[36:25] Carmelo
[36:27] Carmelo and then it says and smelting
[36:32] is the extracting
[36:35] of precious metals precios
[36:44] so I believe it was no coincidence
[36:50] to this place
[36:54] can purify himself
[36:57] again we know he was the prophet of God
[37:00] Amen
[37:03] a human that can relate to you
[37:06] that's what I'm trying to connect to
[37:09] tonight
[37:09] [Music]
[37:26] here on Earth
[37:30] which was a spiritual battle at one
[37:33] point foreign
[38:19] hey man I'm not trying to get excited
[38:21] he's just okay what if God gets you a
[38:23] certain way
[38:25] can identify with me
[38:28] just simply get deep inside God's words
[38:35] you can't explain it you could just
[38:38] simply tell someone else
[38:40] you got to go through it yourself
[38:45] what I'm living
[38:47] and I can't preach to you
[38:49] about somebody I had an experience of a
[38:55] fire experience
[38:57] if I myself haven't had it first
[39:01] be to God Amen
[39:07] [Music]
[39:58] in a full state
[40:24] so God can see
[40:28] you know it's time oh no I guess dimple
[40:31] it's time to give you your Mount Karma
[40:35] Carmelo let's see if brother Brown says
[40:38] in the message
[40:40] painted face Jezebel uh
[40:45] because if we look at it
[40:48] and I feel sometimes people are like
[40:50] this as well
[40:52] I've been like this
[40:55] where I feel like maybe I don't need of
[40:57] nothing
[41:00] please put it up please
[41:04] brother Brown says Elijah's sitting up
[41:06] there for three years
[41:10] just having a good time
[41:15] every night every time a crow would come
[41:19] by
[41:20] Deep right down and give them a sandwich
[41:28] get him a drink of water and Shout a
[41:31] little while and sit back down again
[41:37] if that isn't wonderful
[41:40] if you can look at the picture Brothers
[41:44] Elijah was not foreign
[41:51] [Music]
[42:15] thanks be to God we have a God
[42:18] that knows more than we do yes
[42:27] because we could say day and night
[42:30] I'm fine I'm fine
[42:33] but if you find yourself
[42:36] in the same place
[42:40] I got bad news for you
[42:43] or may be good
[42:45] you're not fine you're stuck and many
[42:49] times you find yourself in a stock stage
[42:53] filling out everything's fine all around
[42:55] us
[43:07] maybe you're receiving Blessing about
[43:09] blessings
[43:10] your life is going fine all right but
[43:14] what about somebody else what about
[43:17] somebody else outside of your family
[43:19] somebody outside your church
[43:23] needs a touch of reality
[43:27] or something
[43:29] because the people of Israel
[43:32] were found in dry
[43:55] they
[43:59] close up in the room
[44:03] man
[44:04] I don't know if there's someone like
[44:06] that you know
[44:07] it's been feeling like that because yes
[44:09] well let me tell you
[44:12] I can't give it to you you don't know
[44:16] God can give that to you yes
[44:19] truly in your desires
[44:21] because my question is
[44:23] what made the people of Israel
[44:27] go up to Mount Carmel Monte Carmelo to
[44:31] hear of this prophets say
[44:47] [Music]
[45:02] I'm not full of worries
[45:25] we are loose but God knew that there was
[45:28] someone there
[45:32] he sent them a message
[45:45] I'm telling you you do we have something
[45:48] and you cannot explain
[45:51] I can't explain it with words
[45:54] but you yourself have to take all of
[45:56] that Etc
[45:58] take it deep within your hearts
[46:05] because your pastor can't do it
[46:08] your mommy and daddy cannot do it
[46:11] they're not gonna make you go up there
[46:16] you have to make a decision
[46:19] a genuine
[46:21] decision
[46:24] to choose
[46:27] samientos
[46:44] she can go and grab everything from the
[46:46] world
[46:49] it's not that hard noise it's easy out
[46:53] there
[46:54] it's easy
[46:58] no one will look at you okay
[47:02] it's your choice tonight
[47:07] what experience do you want to have
[47:08] tonight
[47:10] I know I need another Mount Carmel
[47:13] experience
[47:22] I can't wait for the next Youth Services
[47:50] [Music]
[47:54] [Applause]
[48:01] yes

[48:13] [Applause]
[48:14] Hallelujah contentos
[48:20] we're speaking with the title yo
[48:22] necesito I need an experience
[48:31] the one that needs it here
[48:54] on both sides of this mountain is a
[48:57] valley and God knew
[49:44] to go through our valleys
[49:56] the children of Israel and gathered the
[49:58] prophets together into Mount Carmel yes
[50:17] and Elijah came and saw the people and
[50:20] said how long how ye between two
[50:21] opinions if the Lord be God follow him
[50:24] but if Bell then follow him and the
[50:25] people answered him not a word
[50:33] their silence spoke a lot
[50:38] hombres

[50:48] only remain a prophet of the Lord
[50:49] barbell's prophets are 450 Men Dancing

[51:09] let them therefore give us two Bullocks
[51:12] and let them choose one Bull look for
[51:15] themselves and cut it in pieces and lay
[51:17] it on wood and put no fire under and I
[51:20] will dress the other Bullock and lay it
[51:22] on wood and put no fire under
[51:26] this was The Proposal from Elijah to the
[51:29] people
[51:31] this was his challenge
[51:39] then we'll all serve him
[51:42] but if God is God
[52:10] in your life
[52:13] this is the proposal
[52:15] es
[52:18] that Bells choose a bullet
[52:22] and I'll bring a bullet

[56:40] Elijah mocked him and said cry aloud for
[56:42] he is a God either he is talking on his
[56:45] pursuit or he's on a journey or pure
[56:47] Adventure he sleepeth and must be awake
[56:50] in other words he's too busy

[1:01:04] everyone wants God to move
[1:01:07] but no one wants to do the job
[1:01:10] no one wants to do the hard work
[1:01:13] and he made a trench
[1:01:17] [Music]
[1:01:20] a big trench around the altar
[1:01:23] it is
[1:01:31] and he said do it uh
[1:01:34] 35 34 sorry and he said do it in the
[1:01:37] second time and they did it the second
[1:01:39] time and he said do it the third time
[1:01:40] and they did it the third time
[1:02:01] and the water ran round about the Altar
[1:02:04] and he filled the trench also with water
[1:02:09] buckets
[1:02:14] four four and four cuatro cuatro four
[1:02:17] times four times
[1:02:21] to the way of the Lord
[1:02:26] let me tell you Brothers
[1:02:30] it wasn't hard to turn a light of fire
[1:02:33] in that drought
[1:02:39] you can light a fire with any little
[1:02:42] thing
[1:03:23] and it came to pass the time of the
[1:03:25] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[1:03:27] Elijah the prophet came here and said
[1:03:30] Lord of Abraham Isaac in Israel
[1:03:33] Manifesto let it be known this is
[1:03:45] and that I have done all these things
[1:04:04] the fire is about so far
[1:04:13] it wasn't the longest prayer
[1:04:19] it wasn't his prayer that made Firefall
[1:04:23] it was a sacrifice he prepared
[1:04:27] it was what he brought
[1:04:30] we're going to speak more about that
[1:04:33] I want to give you another summary
[1:04:36] before we get to this part again
[1:04:39] I want to tell you this is
[1:04:45] before Elijah came to this month
[1:04:49] God had been preparing him the
[1:04:53] experience
[1:04:57] without the experience on the brook of
[1:04:59] uh experience
[1:05:05] he wouldn't have been ready
[1:05:09] for him on Mount Carmen
[1:05:13] because God had to Humble him how many
[1:05:17] of us
[1:05:18] have had to go for me you had to be
[1:05:22] humble
[1:05:24] how many of us have asked ourselves what
[1:05:27] are you doing
[1:05:29] is there anyone here
[1:05:35] you say you don't know what God is doing
[1:05:37] in here
[1:05:39] God didn't realize everything he would
[1:05:41] do
[1:05:43] God told him
[1:05:46] the first thing he told me
[1:05:48] go to the brook is
[1:05:53] how long Lord I don't know
[1:06:08] to a river
[1:06:30] a week pass
[1:06:33] age
[1:06:43] no when he
[1:06:45] no yeah yes
[1:06:49] yes
[1:06:58] giving him an experience
[1:07:03] before giving an experience of being
[1:07:05] exalted
[1:07:08] because one of the things that kills men
[1:07:13] that is
[1:07:18] more dangerous
[1:07:20] and many other things
[1:07:23] unknown
[1:07:37] he takes um
[1:08:06] it's like Fort Collins
[1:08:27] and there he is waiting with a widow
[1:08:31] foreign
[1:09:45] when the entire kingdom is looking for
[1:09:48] you
[1:10:36] he has been preparing you
[1:11:13] his word
[1:11:34] be calm no no
[1:11:38] no no
[1:11:39] that's not going to take it you have to
[1:11:42] get to a hunger a pain yes
[1:11:46] God was letting the people feel true
[1:11:49] pain
[1:11:50] of what it was to live without God
[1:11:56] Sita
[1:11:59] um
[1:12:01] patience and humbleness is required
[1:12:05] someone that has a great need is
[1:12:07] required
[1:12:09] and it's required of someone
[1:12:13] that's ready to make a decision
[1:12:16] there was a mountain of decisions
[1:12:20] there was a place
[1:12:22] where they had to make a decision
[1:12:25] Elijah made a Covenant Church
[1:12:32] he wants to have a company
[1:12:42] how sad it is
[1:13:04] and he said it's time to make a decision
[1:13:23] I'm not sure
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:31] oh God
[1:13:35] that's why we come and we worship
[1:13:38] because we're not sure
[1:13:41] it's done for us
[1:13:49] that's why we leave church and do
[1:13:51] everything we do he's not important
[1:13:54] thing that happened in church matters
[1:13:57] because we're not sure
[1:14:00] who God is for us
[1:14:05] what a terrible thing is
[1:14:08] to get to the end of your life
[1:14:11] and realize
[1:14:15] that what we trusted in was a lie
[1:14:21] but my God
[1:14:24] he wants you to make sure my God the

[1:21:46] that people is
[1:21:49] they didn't know what was going to
[1:21:51] happen they didn't have a clue
[1:21:54] of what was going to happen
[1:21:58] lives will change forever
[1:22:15] of you putting him to the test

[1:22:43] no no
[1:22:44] with sacrifice it was a sacrifice he
[1:22:47] offered
[1:22:48] and the place he did it
[1:22:57] he didn't offer any sacrifices
[1:23:00] he offered a sacrifice for sin is
[1:23:09] no sacrifice could be offered without
[1:23:11] salt

[1:23:43] so that water was maybe water from the
[1:23:46] sea the segurus it was for sure water
[1:23:49] from the sea is
