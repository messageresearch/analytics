[19:34] we give a greeting to the ones watching
[19:36] in the internet
[19:38] our sister vicky in california and the
[19:40] ones that are in california
[19:43] our brothers
[19:48] and everyone else who couldn't be here
[19:49] tonight
[19:52] and for the ones that will be watching
[19:54] after as well
[19:57] where the lord says
[20:11] let the lord the god of the spirits of
[20:13] all the flesh set a man over the
[20:15] congregation which may go out before
[20:17] them and which may go in before them and
[20:19] which may lead them out and which may
[20:21] bring them in that the congregation of
[20:23] the lord be not as sheep which have no
[20:26] shepherd
[20:28] says
[20:42] and the lord said unto moses take thee
[20:44] joshua the son of nun a man in whom is
[20:47] the spirit and lay thine hand upon him
[20:50] and set him before eli azar the priests
[20:53] and before all the congregation and give
[20:55] him a charge in their sight
[21:17] and thou shalt put some of thine honor
[21:19] upon him that all the congregation of
[21:21] the children of israel may be obedient
[21:23] and he shall stand before eleazar the
[21:25] priest who shall ask counsel for him
[21:27] after the judgment of arim before the
[21:29] lord at his word shall they go out and
[21:31] at his word they shall come in both he
[21:34] and all the children of israel with him
[21:36] even all the congregation
[21:52] and moses did as the lord commanded him
[21:53] and he took joshua and set him before
[21:55] eleazar the priest and before all the
[21:57] congregation and he laid his hands upon
[21:59] him and gave him a charge as the lord
[22:01] commanded by the hand of moses
[22:05] may bow your head brother father
[22:06] celestial heavenly father
[22:09] we're thankful lord
[22:53] the precious name of the lord jesus
[22:54] christ amen amen
[22:57] you may be seated
[23:01] this passage of the bible
[23:10] is when god orders moses to go to the
[23:12] mountain of urim
[23:16] so he can see the promised land
[23:20] now that moses would not enter
[23:25] moses is asking god
[23:29] if he can have a successor
[23:34] so israel can come into the promised
[23:36] land
[23:41] having the foreknowledge
[23:44] he had already observed
[23:46] joshua
[23:48] josue not only
[25:07] and so much god plays joshua as moses
[25:10] successor
[25:12] algona
[25:14] some of the characteristics god saw in
[25:16] joshua josue
[25:18] joshua was a helper
[25:21] he could help moses anywhere
[25:24] he offered to help
[26:08] forgive me joshua did not move alone
[26:13] joshua always awaited on moses's orders
[26:16] yes that's right
[26:18] one more thing josue joshua
[26:25] was faithful to moses ministry as a
[26:28] prophet and pastor
[26:31] this was one of the qualities joshua
[26:35] he was faithful to the ministry
[26:48] with what the head of the church says
[27:47] servant significa
[27:49] but what does a minister mean
[27:54] is a servant
[27:57] and a servant as a servant
[28:00] that's what ministers
[28:24] all of them that enforce something out
[28:26] there
[29:12] and the preaching ordinance preached
[29:14] 1962.
[29:19] we believe the holy ghost calls men
[29:23] the holy ghost ordains men no importa
[29:26] last month
[29:29] don't matter how much
[29:31] hands we put on brother mckinney
[29:35] or any other minister
[29:37] hour after hour
[29:42] and give them a long uh list of things
[29:45] to sign
[29:49] swearing to certain creeds
[29:52] it won't benefit
[30:39] [Music]
[30:46] so this is what joshua was for moses a
[30:48] servant
[30:51] joshua was always working in the lord's
[30:53] work
[30:55] and that's what god was watching
[31:01] honesty
[31:16] under moses's orders
[31:19] it was on mount sinai with moses
[31:24] who was in charge of the new tabernacle
[31:28] that is 40 years
[31:30] joshua
[31:58] return
[32:42] but when moses delivers them
[32:47] now they're the church of god
[32:51] god bring him out
[32:53] a nation
[32:54] from
[33:07] did not go into the promised land
[33:10] because he smit the rock
[33:19] there's another reason why he did an
[33:21] answer
[33:41] so if moses was the type of the
[33:43] denominational church
[33:45] what was joshua
[33:49] joshua was the type of the holy ghost
[34:04] the ones
[34:11] joshua was a type of the holy ghost
[34:14] the word joshua in hebrew yes jesus is
[34:17] jesus
[34:30] a type of god calling his church coming
[34:33] out of a church because his bride out of
[34:36] a church
[34:37] but it doesn't stop there josue
[34:41] joshua is also a type the ministerio de
[34:43] los ultimos of the end time ministry
[34:57] or coming into the promised land
[35:00] this chosen
[35:28] joshua's ministry castle in this case
[35:31] syria
[35:32] would it be
[35:33] el ministerio de los ultimos the
[35:35] end-time ministry
[35:37] that has a prophet
[35:40] because joshua was also a prophet
[35:56] it was just a change
[36:12] and joshua
[36:15] becomes moses successor
[36:19] to place the bride
[36:22] in the promised land
[36:24] josue
[37:19] with the bride of the lord jesus christ
[37:23] you have the promise of entering into
[37:25] the promised land
[37:26] god bless you
[37:28] [Applause]
[37:34] god bless you brethren
[37:39] we enter now into the story
[37:43] we've entered
[37:45] where
[37:46] moses is
[38:00] but the purpose of god
[38:16] and now our prophet is dead
[38:20] but our works continue through the bride
[38:25] amen amen how many believers are here in
[38:27] this night
[38:30] i just have to express i have a lot of
[38:32] joy
[38:34] especially
[38:36] i'm happy to see my brother bailey here
[38:38] estoy content
[38:40] no he was the first side i saw when i
[38:42] walked up here
[38:45] and
[38:46] he's one of my best friends
[38:48] amigos and all glory to god amen
[38:52] man but this message was born
[38:56] thinking on the bad report of the 10
[38:59] spies pensando de los el reported
[39:05] espios so
[39:08] making a personal haciendo personal we
[39:11] move from slavery
[39:25] you can't think of the people of israel
[39:29] that was their journey amen slavery
[39:34] brokenness
[39:37] but a victorious christian living
[39:40] victoria
[39:52] and blessings even this younes
[40:01] as soon as we stop watching an area
[40:07] the devil is already there
[40:11] so we need a v being constant vigilance
[40:17] um caleb and joshua
[40:20] josue no i don't want to get too deep
[40:22] but
[40:37] so if you i can think of these other 10
[40:39] spies
[40:44] with negative negativity
[40:48] amen amen
[40:49] because they were not watching
[40:53] they're not watching the promises of god
[40:57] they were watching the same thing
[41:01] so many christians
[41:02] christians failed to leave the place of
[41:05] slavery
[41:12] and to answer
[41:15] in a place of victory
[41:19] these 10 spies
[41:22] espionage they failed to enter in a
[41:24] place of victory
[41:52] you know there are people that are
[41:53] offended
[41:56] that the occupation of the land of
[41:59] canaan

[42:17] the moment that you give that i give my
[42:20] life to christ

[42:25] a christian
[42:28] the moment you invite the holy spirit to
[42:30] come in your life
[42:34] and the journey of the christian life
[42:39] cristiano where things are inside your
[42:41] head
[42:56] you can
[43:04] but what's interesting about the passage
[43:06] of joshua
[43:09] is that god has given them the land
[43:15] the issue
[43:17] the problem is not
[43:19] no is if god would give it to them
[43:23] the issue
[43:25] it's not if god is
[43:28] is not if god
[43:31] is going to give you the holy ghost
[43:34] the issue el problema is if they're
[43:37] going to occupy
[43:41] the land of canaan
[43:44] the issue the problem is if you're going
[43:46] to occupy
[43:49] the position
[43:51] in the holy spirit
[44:34] of a
[44:48] in the ten spies that we're saying we
[44:50] should have died back there
[44:59] amen amen we wanna remain bound
[45:09] [Music]
[45:24] but joshua's going to show us a
[45:25] different life
[45:29] and you know what the book of or
[45:31] starting this book of joshua

[45:53] your life
[45:56] for you to do exactly
[46:14] there's never been another greater time
[46:19] joshua 1 5 says josue
[46:24] there shall not any man be able to stand
[46:27] before the other days of thy life
[46:33] as i was with moses so will i be with
[46:36] thee

[47:50] have
[48:04] again the same thing lo mismo i will
[48:07] never leave thee
[48:10] nor forsake thee

[48:15] time
[48:32] that we will not fear que nobo
[48:36] like david said
[48:38] the lord is my comfort mediocre
[48:42] amen amen
[48:43] joshua 1-6
[48:45] josue
[48:48] uno says and i'm going to be closing
[48:51] what i want to focus on
[48:54] here it says be strong and of good
[48:56] courage
[49:00] for unto this people shall not divide
[49:02] for an inheritance to the land
[49:09] which i swear unto the fathers to give
[49:13] tierra de la hoya
[49:29] command courage and strength from joshua
[49:33] josue
[49:36] anybody ask yourselves
[49:40] he has promised joshua
[49:42] josue
[49:51] and in that sense he becomes a type of
[49:53] jesus
[49:57] jesus just like joshua's dividing the
[49:59] land jesus is dividing the gift
[50:08] now are the occupants of the land gonna
[50:10] go quietly
[50:20] the ones that occupy your mind
[50:24] are they going to leave quietly
[50:29] the ones that occupy your flesh
[50:33] we gotta admit brother tenemos
[50:36] there's other spirits occupying us is
[51:01] that he's going to be part of in the
[51:03] future
[51:06] there are hard-fought battles
[51:09] there's battles
[51:11] that you will be part of in the future
[51:15] amen amen
[51:17] so it's going to take strength and
[51:18] courage
[51:21] for you to walk the walk god has called
[51:24] you to wake up
[51:27] it's going to take strength and courage
[51:32] to pray
[51:34] for your brother
[51:47] the courage we're talking about
[52:02] amen amen
[52:04] the courage that i'm reading here

[53:50] what god has called us to do
[53:54] so fulfill

[54:18] my desire and the fathers are one
[54:21] misdemeanors
[54:35] desiring what the lord wants
