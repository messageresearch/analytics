missionary pastor now they are a part of us we'll be going every three months to be with them corinthians 13 1-8 we know this very well this is though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have no charity i am become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i can remove mountains and have no not charity i am nothing else is and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profited me nothing el amore sufrido charity suffers long and is kind charity envious not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked think is no evil justicia de la verdad rejoices not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things professional charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail where there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away let us pray father celestial father first of all my heart is so grateful for how good you have been towards us you have been good with us in our church helped [Music] i ask you for my brethren over there that are connected to california likewise our brothers from california and the others that connect around the world lord senor que tu puede precious name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated a lot of love and we are very grateful towards them um the subject i spoke on over there uh it's so real to them as it is to us as well the only thing that will endure is is love reputable repeat this after me the only thing the only thing that will endure is el amor is love the only thing that has enough strength to to endure is love it will come against because his time is winding down and you know when you have the last seconds last minutes you want to give it all and the he doesn't have much time left and he will attack us with everything he can the bible speaks to us there were four times horse was the red horse and it was the the bit of black but in this last time horses together but i've found out of one thing [Music] is that is exactly what has been attacked in our time el diablo the devil knows that love is the only thing and i spoke to the the brethren the child of a mother i've shared it here previously because let me tell you the emotions they don't last very long emotions don't last very long for serving god through emotions or because of emotions [Music] in church instead of taking you out because he knows that if he has you in church he has you deceived but he wants you in a lukewarm state [Music] partner i was listening to that this morning a pardon is not a partner unless you receive it as a pardon and love is not love unless [Music] but he got a hold of her and and sarah says go to her rebecca says rebecca i want to let you know although you have my father in your hands [Music] such a lukewarm state how can we solamente just love him halfway brothers when he has loved us so much and with that [Music] step forward so foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] wherever we are yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] yes yes [Music] hour [Music] [Music] foreign hey man amen [Music] first of all i'd like you to please stand and i'll open your uh your scriptures with me the book of luke chapter 2 verse 49. when you have it you could say amen amen [Music] we'd like to thank our brothers and send a lot of greetings and love and thank them for everything that they did for us just so that you would know how you treated us how they treated us i'm not a half the person half the person that they are or the people that they are you know necesitable and i needed to see that scripture says like this and says jesus uh he said unto them him speaking to his mother uh mary cuando alvidaro they left him in the city how was it that you sought me was he not that i must be about my father's business you may be seated the the business of the lord jesus christ son lost my [Music] my pastor spoke of before i i came up here es es lo que paso that's what happened and quickly i'd like to thank the brothers because i needed help and quickly just to testify okay you all heard that since last year i've is love even says that faith and the knowledge maybe my obedience will cease one day and that's why the lord knew i had to go to this trip what a camp because during the preaching of brother tito on sunday estoy and it became a revelation because the lord revealed it maybe not the first time that i heard it but the second time he did reveal it to him brother imagine if you had two drops of blood of the lord jesus christ in your hands to those drops of blood of the lord jesus christ but more even more special is what that blood brought or bought and if you i don't know if you're but because of love before it was a routine to come to church it was and it was through obedience just in being because something more precious than the blood of the lord jesus is here [Music] work and we have to take care of what god does because they're the the lord's business to take care of the father's business and a small flame has been lit a flame of love pero but a little bit of love is still love god bless you [Applause] i would like to tell the youth from here um at we can't be double-minded or serving in church don't undermine that he knows [Music] siandonhoven so i being a young man and primary people it was a privilege to be to be on the under the first team come on inglesia sent a starting lineup i felt like i was like i was in the starting lineup there's a lot of youth here if i stand up and i i dedicate myself to the father's business the the gods team will become better so encourage the youth just keep pressing forward says when i go
