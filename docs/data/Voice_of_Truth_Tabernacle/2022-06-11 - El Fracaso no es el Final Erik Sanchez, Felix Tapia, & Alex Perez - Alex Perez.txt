[Music] god if we may open our bibles um we're happy to have him here still the word of god says like this and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was mighty in the in words and in deeds let's pray lord jesus christ and thank you for everything christ oh a person or a theme parapelliculus for a movie para para libros or books or work of arts and for many other things moses is [Music] amongst or the chief of egypt the converter in pharaoh of that man that was in the desert for 40 years and could survive hablar to [Applause] the first five books of the bible you read run in a cycle of 40s he was called at 40. refused by his brethren went out to on the desert and herded sheep for 40 years when he was 80 israel he sent him down delivered israel out of egypt and when he got close to the promised land he was 120 years old he had the stride of a young man and his sights never failed him that's right but look authority leaving everything behind the candle la grande leaving the greatness that they were going to worship his name erase his name el saldo the wage era was of a man who failed a man lost everything a man where he abided was known but now he was found himself alone found himself frustrated as a failure this is what i want to read from our brother branham yeah that's been total to your parents even as a preacher how many times have i failed to you i'm his father it's my parents i'm hermano it's my brother but let that not be in finale we don't have a strong character come on brother come on look when we talk about failure no one likes to talk about faith no one likes to hear the word failure because he decided to do it for himself you come to be as a failure as moses was look at before moses manifest manifested what god had many times i see your mess until that's how i felt i leave god outside i'm in my room just like our pastor said last wednesday television but when i look let me in [Music] many times it's the hand of god and i believe that when moses killed that egyptians maybe he fed in darkness i'll give entry to my brother now we found moses being called it and after being commissioned he filled his commission by trying to do it in the way that he thought was best therefore it teaches us again that we can't take what we think is best what man think thinks is best we've got to take the way that god has said is best therefore we find out that he fled from the face of pharaoh into the wilderness god it's interrupted i have take god [Applause] god bless you brothers who's happy to be here tonight failure isn't my final and if we can turn our bibles to exodus chapter 2 verse 11 and 12. verse and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an egyptian smiting in hebrew one of his brethren says and he looked this way and that way and when he saw there was no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand and the message that we talked with titled this failure is not my final el fracasso you know and moses grew up receiving some of the best education it was some of the best science that ever existed when he float like the brothers said previously uh he was floating down the the nile river and he was picked up by pharaoh's daughter and she named him moses and to review it again it means taken out or drawn out significant you know if if we were to build try to build a pyramid like they build then we wouldn't be able to do it you know and i can just imagine how er how educated moses was his mother always told him you're gonna deliver one day deliver the savior children but he tried to do it he he but he knew he was going to do it one day and when he saw the egyptians and at that time he thought he unders he thought he was doing the right thing but even his only even his his own brothers didn't did it didn't want to be in his side yeah you know because he thought he was doing the right thing but he ran away and when he fled to the to the wilderness he met their uh uh ethiopian girl is i'm not sure if i'm going to pronounce her name right but her name is sapporo sephora sephora and she bear two children and moses became the the sheep herder for his father-in-law and i'm sure at that time he was living very comfortably and he probably had forgotten about his education and how smart he was and you know and that's the way god wanted him you know that's the way he wanted him so he can go and and and and and speak to him and one day when he was wandering through through he was wondering in the wilderness that's when he saw the burning bush and and he said there's no way it's going to be possible because i am not educated and they're not going to believe me you know i failed them and they're not going to believe me because i failed them but god told them go back and do it israel it didn't matter how how he thought he was a failure but had something for him he knew elsa that it didn't matter how many times he had failed god had restored his faith you know and sometimes we can't have faith you know because we we want to be we want to educate ourselves with so many different things you know how brother tito said on on wednesday we fill ourselves with more things with more tv than what we do with the word of god and you know and to be honest i think i could be honest with you guys sometimes i feel myself with more things of the world you know i i i to be honest i i i am a failure yo so you know yeah you know i am a failure of what this what the bible has for us you know we we we we need to empty ourselves we need to empty ourselves because when we're filled with things of the world you know we cannot we cannot let god in nope he filled himself he filled him with faith jose normally says confess and i believe that he can fill our uh fill us again you know it you know it doesn't matter how many times you fail important it doesn't matter how many times you get knocked down but what matters is how many times you get back michael jordan once said michael jordan you know a winner is just a loser that tried again so brothers it doesn't matter how many times it says but you have to just keep trying does not mean that god left us behind significa it means that god has a better way for you and i think you know we have to let god work in us we may fail god but we need we need to empty ourselves with this modern trend thread one more time but we need to empty ourselves with this modern thread tren and we have to let god you know the world looks nice it looks beautiful honestly and it looks like you want to go and have fun just like the world list you know but we weren't called for that we were called for something better algo el tiempo to let those gifts pour out you let those gifts bloom you know sometimes we don't let them go out which is not gonna be because we're too full with the things of the world and we let those things hold us back i know i let those things happen they let me they hold me back and how is the way that god can help us i want to read a scripture but brother isaac is going to help me now espanol he can't do that he can't do it it's against his principles he'd have to go against his word and that he will not do he will not do it as long as you don't cope with his word you have to come we've got to come to this before anything else can be done you know that every one of you is aware of that how many believes that raise your hand sure you believe it now let's do something about it i don't know about you but i want to do something i want to empty myself i can imagine moses when he got his wife and and and his two kids and he went back to egypt and he said i am gonna do one man invasion he's going to deliver the whole pueblo you know imagine how determined he was going to determine just be determined like moses don't let nothing hold you back it doesn't matter how many times you fail just keep going just keep going it doesn't matter what the enemy comes and tells you important it tells you how many times you have failed he brings all your mistakes it doesn't matter how many times he brings your past to you you know what we need to do today we need to bring him his future record stronger than hallelujah i was reading a few moments ago scripture that somebody you wrote is but not everyone will get up after that always remember this embargo even though el fracasso no es definitivo failure is is not is not final [Music] and it gives me a great happiness to see what god has for them in their coming years moses was that typical child we've all heard it's not enough you're a child of god uh [Music] oh god's plan but before that moses grew up with many things upon him perhaps he would ponder vision for our lives but as and we don't know what we're doing here you come to church three times a week the pastor is more happy with people that tried than than the the ones that uh are just sitting down what i want to tell you is that failure you should not be afraid to fail you [Applause] is price higher [Applause] he kills an egyptians he goes fleeing and he goes uh just like we do like a failure have you ever tried to do something and and it's gone wrong diablo and the devil accuses you of working you're miserable understood [Music] here are my errors [Music] and the most tremendous thing about this burning bush is i'm finishing with this simply with the fact that bernie bush was brilliant it was something that that stood out they lived in the desert there was so many fires [Music] 120 degrees in the desert okay but what caught it wasn't it it was the bush was burning but it was not consumed this evening [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] there's something special in the bride of the lord jesus christ that beyond all those things are not more there's a love [Music] it's how he killed the egyptian [Music] i will [Music] matter oh your failures do not matter [Music] what matters is that you're here let's try it once again [Music] not enough lord candice who do you say that i am [Music] if you could say that i believe with all my heart [Music] brothers working in our lives [Music] oh
