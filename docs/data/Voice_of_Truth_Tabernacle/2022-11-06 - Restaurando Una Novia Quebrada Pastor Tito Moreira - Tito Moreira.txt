Jeremiah 8 20. I want to speak on restoring a broken bride restaurant restoring a broken bride Jeremiah 8 20. you have a brother the Harvest is past the summer has ended and we are not saved for the hurt of the daughter of my people am I heard I am black astonishment has taken hold on me verse 22. foreign simply reconnect with you and be consecrated once again I believe every Sunday service every service the hello are receiving Restorations a watcher and as a watcher in this place I have to ask myself the question how much restoration has happened in our lives because something is to speak about restoration and something else is to truly receive restoration it's easy to speak on restoration is restoration is very difficult it's a process that's painful it's a processarily you must go through a lot of heartbreak so you can truly become fully restored and that's the place we don't want to go in no queremos sometimes we want God to take us the way we are and that's where the job starts where the work starts but many times for God can begin a restoration he can now restore now God does received but he can't work until we are broken I want to speak on this Pride the Bible speaks the Kingdom of Heaven is foreign [Applause] marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready and so her was granted that she should be already for the fine linen is the righteousness of Saints and the angel told me blessed write the names of them that are invited to the Lamb's wedding supper and there we see once again that God is comparing this time there's a bridegroom and a ceremony a ceremony in a wedding there's a bridegroom and a bride all right we're speaking on restoring and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband in English it says a bride adorned for her husband and then verse 9 says and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which are the seven vows follow the seven last plagues and talk with me saying come hither I will shoot Thee the bride the Lamb's wife but all of this is is already in God's word we are the bride we've made a covenant question he's made us a promise that we were here in First Corinthians 15 God Compares or the Bible Compares Jesus Christ Jesus Jesus to Adam it actually says he was the last Adam the second act together that means the last Adam Jesus so if the Bible is comparing Jesus there has to be a similarity between the first Adam and the last time Adam from Genesis and Jesus Christ Matthew John 1 whatever you want to call it [Music] if you read the previous verses you'll find out speaking about Jesus Christ I want you to understand we can see history repeat itself with the last Adam the Bible says from Adam came forth the woman now this is very important Adam's bride came out of himself I want you to notice this is not good for man to be alone the Bible says I shouldn't be alone the word it says it is not good for man to be alone La Costilla and the rib from Adam I don't think it was just any type of I'm gonna take this I think that's why you have to sedate him a little because it would be something painful when Jesus Christ died it wasn't something easy when he was placed on that same bed the Bible says pierced him on the side yes opened his side don't tell me it was something easy he was in pain and they still Pierce him on his side they pierce him on his side water and blood come out foreign from Brokenness Lord Jesus Christ make it seem very easy I ask myself how want to know how much no doleria how much didn't it how much wouldn't that hurt if that happens to us I understand there were many things that are now a day I believe God does everything perfect she had to break off a rib rib hi ferente that's different the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ was born had her birth on such a painful day Hermosa it wasn't a wonderful day it was wonderful for a Christian yes wonderful for the children of God yes but Jesus Christ was in pain he was in pain every one of those uh every one of those one of our iniquities comes into life man a new moment in a moment of Brokenness is where the bride was born I should tell us something what hertzgar the most okay what hurts Jesus the most is his bride important this is very important that he could not deceive Adam is because he was married to the image of God pero la mujer but the woman ever if she came a little more different to the woman his bride the serpent was used for this you know if he attacked the woman he knew if he attacked the woman he would attack the man if he attacks the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ he is attacking God's plan the devil can't go against God simply he can't but the devil does know he can go against Pride he hinders God's plan ovia because the bride is the one on earth now the bridegroom has left and the devil took advantages standing here on Earth the bride she is representing him and the devil knows he attacks the brideos attacks God's plan pride is so important are the same hold on now Adam didn't find his bride the advance his bride came out of France so the woman was Adam um foundation so the rest can take a little meat from here the woman was not found right she was not found foreign he can take the man that's why the bride is an attacked bride La Novia is the Bride is a broken bride Elementary says the body of Jesus Christ is the illness and body that is most in need in other words the body of the Lord Jesus Christ and the most in need because sometimes we speak of a higher things speak on the condition we're found in restaurants oh you'll be quiet there but that's the truth is second Corinthians 2 Corinthians 11 verse 1. for I am jealous of you you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I might present to you as chess as a chaste virgin to Christo but I Fearless by any means as the serpent beguiled if through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is for if he that cometh preaches another Jesus whom he whom we have not received or if you receive another Spirit which you have not received for another gospel which you have not received ye might well bear with us the first church the Bride of Jesus Christ was already been deceived all of that you're very mistaken very mistaken now look what happened as the woman Eve is Posada was a bride because marriage has not been consumed yet long enough the serpent entered and the next time we see the woman in the next chapter or a few verses later we see her broken we see Eve broken um she realized she was naked she realized she lost everything and we see Adam having to redeemed his bride he comes and the entire creation fell let's see the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ for a moment she was born in La Cruz the surgery began at the cross and then life came in here life came in on Pentecost day that's when the life came inside that's when the Holy Spirit descended it is that we're divided broken this is important this is important it's important there to understand how the pride comes it's important to understand our conditions at the first churches was a church full of powers [Music] she was cut off completely pero um but my point don't worry if you don't understand the details my point is that it's a broken bride El Diablo the devil goes against the bride with everything he's got El Diablo the devil goes against us and if he can succeed to break this price is annihilated Lord Jesus Christ is so broken Lord Jesus Christ is broken we are a broken body says and the way they were tortured here they go Senor to see Jose I say Lord your children are so broken matrimonious I see the marriages the lives Lord we're so broken the devil has has ripped us apart the devil has taken advantage of the little that we give sometimes and the Devil comes in when you give him a space he does everything he can buy everything he can to destroy us that's the devil's job but God needs a broken bride dios a broken bride is a future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride um I'm going to start on the third it's actually the end of 127. they say is
