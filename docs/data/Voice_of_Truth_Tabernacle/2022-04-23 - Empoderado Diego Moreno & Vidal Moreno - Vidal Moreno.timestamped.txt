[20:10] so great is the measure of our father's
[20:14] world
[20:18] great is the
[20:20] [Music]
[20:28] god bless everyone
[20:31] how many are happy to be in the house of
[20:32] god today
[20:34] amen there's no better place to be in
[20:36] the house of our lives
[20:40] amen let's open our bibles
[20:44] the book of genesis
[20:46] says chapter 37
[20:50] and we'll go ahead and start at verse 3.
[20:55] amen man
[20:57] i'll go ahead and read it or i'll give
[20:58] you a little bit of time to find it
[21:10] now israel loved joseph more than all
[21:12] his children because he was the son of
[21:14] his old age and he made him a coat of
[21:17] many colors
[21:31] go ahead and jump down to verse 13 now
[21:36] and it says and israel said unto joseph
[21:39] do not thy brethren feed the flock and
[21:41] shekel
[21:42] come and i will send thee unto them and
[21:44] he said to him here am i.
[21:59] and now lastly verse 14.
[22:02] and he said to him go i pray thee see
[22:05] whether it be well with thy brethren and
[22:07] with the and well with the flocks and
[22:09] bring me word again so he sent him out
[22:12] of the veil of hebron and he came to
[22:15] chican
[22:22] las vegas
[22:38] celestial
[22:49] and i just asked you that your words be
[22:51] spoken today father
[23:04] i just asked you be with us tonight god
[23:06] and may your will
[23:15] amen amen amen so today are you may be
[23:19] seated
[23:21] and today
[23:22] along with my dad um
[23:24] we're going to be talking about joseph
[23:30] jose and for a title we've chosen
[23:33] empowered
[23:45] amen so the piece of scripture that
[23:47] we've uh we've read today
[23:53] it tells us that joseph uh being the
[23:55] youngest was given a cody man
[24:00] and joseph was last in line he had 11
[24:03] before him
[24:08] so imagine that you're 17 years old
[24:13] your oldest brother is like 40.
[24:18] hey man so i think it's safe to say that
[24:19] joseph was the weakest out of everyone
[24:28] i don't think that's such a bad thing
[24:33] amen because god chooses those uh that
[24:36] are the weakest to be made strong amen
[24:41] his word says my my strength is made
[24:43] perfect in weakness i mean
[24:48] amen so god isn't looking for someone
[24:50] that doesn't need help god god is
[24:51] looking for someone that can't
[24:53] establish
[24:58] someone who needs his help amen
[25:01] and another thing that we see here
[25:05] is that joseph was given a coat of many
[25:06] colors
[25:10] and what have we been given
[25:26] that coat was filled with the seven
[25:28] colors of the rainbow
[25:31] colors
[25:32] and each of each one of these colors
[25:36] it represents one of the seven churches
[25:57] the entire godhead the entire the
[25:59] entirety of god is at our disposal
[26:05] amen and we know that god is so huge
[26:19] can i then ask you what what about when
[26:21] god walks up to you does god have
[26:34] what do you do with what brother brennan
[26:35] has given us amen chaos
[26:49] personally when i see those messages
[26:51] sitting on the shelf collecting dust it
[26:53] makes me feel bad because
[26:56] especially
[27:17] one last thing here from what we've uh
[27:19] what we've read is that joseph was uh he
[27:22] was given authority he was put as a
[27:23] supervisor amen
[27:29] is that him being the youngest that his
[27:31] father chose him to go and check on his
[27:32] brothers
[27:38] amen and that's i believe that's the way
[27:40] we should be too okay
[27:43] hey man you've been empowered with the
[27:44] caring for your brother nosotros
[28:01] that for for for the age that we're
[28:02] living in
[28:04] the step for the age that we're living
[28:05] in
[28:10] is a brotherly kindness amen
[28:14] so you've been empowered to care for
[28:15] your brothers
[28:20] and many times we ask god for help we
[28:21] ask god to be empowered
[28:27] and god sends god sends one of our
[28:29] brothers
[28:32] when we say god i thought i asked you
[28:34] for help
[28:38] and the help was found in our brother
[28:39] amen
[28:43] i would like to take a look at what the
[28:45] world's definition of of where power
[28:47] comes from is
[28:48] definition
[28:55] when you're empowered what does that
[28:56] mean
[29:00] i mean the definition that i found here
[29:02] is the definition
[29:05] the process of becoming stronger and
[29:07] more confident
[29:14] especially in controlling and
[29:16] controlling one's life and claiming
[29:17] one's rights especially
[29:24] and then the second one here says
[29:29] but empowerment can also have many
[29:30] different meanings to different people
[29:36] different significantes
[29:48] amen so pretty much what we can draw
[29:50] from these definitions
[30:07] the world gives you the idea that too
[30:08] that to do as you please is to have
[30:10] power
[30:17] and that to believe as you want us to
[30:19] have power immensely
[30:34] hey man it's come to the point where
[30:35] people say if i want to be a guy one day
[30:37] i can be a guy
[30:46] or if i want to be a girl i can be a
[30:48] girl a man
[31:01] amen did you know that the
[31:03] the flag for the for the gays and
[31:05] lesbians it's it's made up of many
[31:07] colors too
[31:15] so do you know how people are barely
[31:16] finding out who they are
[31:23] they've lived their entire lives being
[31:24] the opposite sex
[31:29] amen
[31:30] amen we have to we have to find out who
[31:33] we are too
[31:37] amen
[31:40] this right here is that you have right
[31:43] there
[31:44] this is just square one is this is just
[31:47] a base this is
[31:49] this is step number one god has so much
[31:51] more for you
[31:54] and did you know that the world is
[31:55] waiting for you to find out who you are
[32:01] romans 8 19 says like this romano's
[32:05] it says like this
[32:06] for the earnest expectation of the
[32:08] creature waiteth for the manifestation
[32:10] of the sons of god
[32:27] and acts acts 2 17 says like this
[32:32] and it shall come to pass in the last
[32:34] days
[32:37] saith god
[32:39] i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh
[32:44] and your sons and your daughters shall
[32:45] prophesy
[32:48] and your young men shall see visions
[32:52] and your old men shall dream dreams
[33:04] now i want to talk a little bit about
[33:06] what god what what where does god say
[33:08] power comes from
[33:14] hey man luke 24 49.
[33:16] um
[33:20] 49.
[33:23] but just bear with me i know i'm reading
[33:24] a lot but i'm i'm getting somewhere i
[33:26] promise
[33:33] and it says like this ccic and behold i
[33:36] send the promise of my father upon you
[33:38] but terry ye in the city of jerusalem
[33:41] until you be endued with power from on
[33:42] high
[33:44] luke
[33:46] 1 2
[33:47] 29 49
[33:50] 24 29.
[34:03] hey man so this phrase from on high
[34:05] alright
[34:10] now this is telling us where power comes
[34:12] from
[34:17] and according to the to the dictionary
[34:30] amen so pretty much what god is telling
[34:31] us here is that all power comes from god
[34:33] amen
[34:37] how many want powers
[34:39] how many want to live the life to have
[34:41] power
[34:44] hey man sometimes we have to put our own
[34:45] self aside so that god can
[34:51] when god first released the holy spirit
[34:53] to the church
[35:00] the bible says that they were all in one
[35:01] accord
[35:04] and that means that you have to put
[35:06] yourself aside
[35:09] amen sometimes sometimes we say oh it
[35:11] doesn't fit with my beliefs
[35:15] it doesn't coordinate with my agenda i
[35:17] don't have time
[35:20] let me tell you brothers god wants to
[35:22] take you a lot farther than time is bro
[35:28] god wants
[35:51] you don't hesitate to put on the word
[35:52] and say that it feels good amen
[35:58] amen amen amen we see coming back to the
[36:02] story of of joseph and israel
[36:07] we see that uh that israel chose joseph
[36:10] amen the
[36:13] amen and it was it was interesting to
[36:16] see that because him being the youngest
[36:17] it seemed like he'd just be out of the
[36:19] question for that special coat amen
[36:40] to receive the power amen
[36:43] hey man i just want to see i just want
[36:45] to show you just dig into this power
[36:47] that i've been talking about
[37:34] us to to be empowered by things on earth
[37:40] amen but we'll get his power if it's not
[37:41] tested
[37:47] and when you see that the question
[37:54] joseph got his coat they took it off
[38:01] i don't know about you guys but i'd be
[38:03] pretty bummed out if they took michael
[38:04] jordan
[38:08] probably wasn't even a day
[38:12] amen amen but that didn't phase him
[38:30] i know that if i got a call from my dad
[38:31] and my brothers did not feel special
[38:41] amen so then can i ask you
[38:42] uh how attached are you to these worldly
[38:45] things amen to these earthly things
[38:51] to the money to the clothes
[38:56] whatever it is that that you desire
[38:58] they say what if what if it was all
[39:00] taken away
[39:04] what if what if one day just just like
[39:06] job in the blink of an eye everything's
[39:08] just gone from you
[39:11] a hope and unable
[39:29] he died naked some people picture him
[39:31] with the cloth but it is naked
[39:39] yeah he was
[39:40] naked i believe he still manifested what
[39:43] he was
[39:44] told
[39:47] so if you came from jesus
[39:50] jesus
[39:51] it doesn't matter what they take from
[39:53] you
[40:17] amen i'm in
[40:19] hey man brother that's all i have but
[40:21] god bless you this is
[40:24] [Applause]
[40:36] i just uh
[40:39] i want to
[40:40] just hit on what diego spoke of a little
[40:42] bit
[40:45] joseph
[40:47] uh you know being empowered
[40:51] you know the first uh the first
[40:53] the first time we see uh
[40:55] the the rainbow la primera
[40:59] it's in uh it's in genesis chapter six s
[41:01] and hennessey's capitol los angeles uh
[41:04] you know verse three uh versicolors uh i
[41:07] just kind of want to uh go to verse
[41:09] three for a little bit
[41:11] you don't have to stand up
[41:14] but it says like this what are these
[41:16] scenes it says and the lord said
[41:31] you know had seen what man
[41:33] had done
[41:36] you know
[41:37] it knows time
[41:40] it's very similar to the time that we
[41:41] live in
[41:42] milan
[41:44] you know there was a lot of violence
[41:49] you know i imagine there was there was
[41:51] just a strife everywhere
[41:55] but you know through all that
[41:59] god was still striving with man
[42:04] you know he was he was still trying to
[42:05] he was still striving with man
[42:09] you know verse six elves
[42:12] you know of that same chapter
[42:14] you know what it says it it says he said
[42:17] it says you know and it repented the
[42:19] lord that he had made man on earth
[42:24] and it grieved him at his heart
[42:28] you know uh when you read that
[42:31] esto you know you might say well god
[42:33] repented in making man
[42:37] you know the last part says
[42:40] you know that it grieved him at his
[42:42] heart
[42:44] you know it hurt god
[42:46] with you
[42:47] he was in pain el estabando lord you
[42:50] know when you lose somebody you said
[42:52] you know you're grieving us
[42:55] oh you're hurting you said
[43:37] you know but and we know that um the the
[43:39] uh the flood came ross
[43:43] you know god was gonna bring judgment
[43:45] upon the earth
[43:47] amen amen because of all the things that
[43:50] man had done
[44:06] you
[44:48] knowing that
[44:59] maybe he couldn't see past what the
[45:01] rainbow means
[45:16] what it
[45:30] he's
[45:56] he gives this robe to joseph
[46:42] [Music]
[47:34] and this is something that's very
[47:35] special
[48:16] you know if this if this was a perfect
[48:18] church
[48:46] god gave
[49:14] is
[50:10] is giving this status
[50:15] you know i think that the youth in
[50:17] particular
[50:20] you know are very uh are very prone to
[50:22] you know
[50:23] looking at their status
[50:31] especially especially not on social
[50:34] media
[50:36] no you want people to know someone
[51:15] you know because we put available for
[51:17] everybody else
[52:11] because you know it wasn't his fault he
[52:12] was given the road
[52:17] it was not his fault
[52:19] you see the other guys looked at him
[52:21] nosotros
[52:22] they saw him they're like well he thinks
[52:23] he's better than us
[52:26] because he was given this
[52:29] i believe
[52:31] that the way he behaved
[52:34] the way he carried himself
[52:38] to his father
[52:40] that he was worthy of the culture
[52:43] that he was worthy of wearing what i
[52:45] think what was given to him
[52:49] hey man a man i believe that
[52:52] because because beyond the codes
[52:56] go beyond this coach
[52:58] i want to
[53:13] excuse me
[53:14] uh there is more i must oh there is more
[53:17] to you i must
[53:20] than just the the the appearance of
[53:22] godliness
[53:25] amen amen i believe that now i'm not
[53:28] saying to to look terrible
[53:33] but there's more to it
[53:37] there's more to being a christian
[53:40] christian than just putting a tie on it
[53:44] or or just putting on long dresses
[53:48] and having long hair
[53:51] there's more to it today
[53:53] there is so much more
[54:35] he was a type of perfectionist
[54:38] and that's what the church
[54:41] of jesus christ
[54:43] will have to be then
