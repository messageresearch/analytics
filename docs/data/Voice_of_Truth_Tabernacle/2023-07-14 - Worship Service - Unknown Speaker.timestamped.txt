[1:15:47] and in the ocean
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:56] foreign
[1:16:01] [Music]
[1:16:20] I'd like to give a quick little story
[1:16:23] [Music]
[1:16:25] about a young girl
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:29] they used to think
[1:16:31] that in order for God to love me
[1:16:36] in order for God to use me
[1:16:40] in order for God to accept my poor
[1:16:44] record Soul at the altario
[1:16:48] that I needed to be clean and Perfect
[1:16:53] by My Own Strength
[1:16:58] but that's not true foreign
[1:17:15] [Music]
[1:17:28] but on a Friday night I realized
[1:17:33] that I needed to go back to the door
[1:17:39] oh my package my mistakes and my friends
[1:17:45] bring them to the Altar
[1:17:47] and leave them there
[1:17:51] we come to church
[1:17:53] not forgot to look at and point at all
[1:17:57] the good parts in US
[1:18:02] [Music]
[1:18:04] we come to be correct
[1:18:09] therefore so we can be obedient
[1:18:12] and just worship Him
[1:18:15] because I once heard this
[1:18:18] is that the devil likes to come to us
[1:18:23] it's too true
[1:18:29] he's told me you overslept
[1:18:33] um
[1:18:35] you're not where you're at in your life
[1:18:37] where you should be no says
[1:18:40] so you're worthless worthless
[1:18:50] because the devil caught me in two
[1:18:53] truths
[1:18:57] the only truth that I believe is
[1:19:01] that I'm under the blood
[1:19:05] and because of that blood
[1:19:08] no matter what mistakes I have still
[1:19:11] Maybe
[1:19:15] no matter every
[1:19:16] everything
[1:19:18] [Music]
[1:19:21] he is still faithful
[1:19:24] he still loves me
[1:19:28] and he is forever Gonna Be by my side
[1:19:32] so I invite everyone along with me
[1:19:37] as we sing this next song
[1:19:43] leave it all at at the feet of Jesus
[1:19:48] stop carrying it around
[1:19:52] okay
