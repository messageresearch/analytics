[17:30] she goes no DNA
[17:33] [Music]
[17:34] oh I don't if you'd be seated for a few
[17:59] moments I feel a little a little strange
[18:05] right now I'm not used to I want to give
[18:17] a short testimony I think that I think
[18:28] he likes when you testify will you brag
[18:33] about your father
[18:38] you know he I think I think he likes it
[18:46] you know I my kids brag about me and you
[18:51] know I get excited and I think God you
[19:00] know he's the same way when you brag
[19:04] about how great your father and your
[19:06] Heavenly Father has been you know he
[19:11] just he just wants to do more for you
[19:15] you know I was just I was working in in
[19:18] Denver for most of the year you know I
[19:25] was I was starting to get a very tired
[19:29] also waking up at 4:30 I wouldn't get
[19:35] home sometimes till 6:30 7:00 so I was
[19:42] just you know when I on my trips up
[19:44] there and on the tree on the way back
[19:48] [Music]
[19:50] I had a lot of time to think on the
[19:53] things of God because I think that you
[19:58] should set time aside you know to talk
[20:03] with God I don't believe you
[20:06] unnecessarily have to close your eyes to
[20:08] pray you can talk to him wherever you're
[20:13] at with your eyes open and while you're
[20:18] driving you know and just just just
[20:22] think about his how great he's been you
[20:26] know I think he visited at that time too
[20:30] you know when you're just thinking about
[20:33] him that's just when he comes down and
[20:38] on one of those trips you know I I was I
[20:43] was expressing how I felt how tired my
[20:48] body was beginning to feel and and and
[20:53] and I was like but you know what you
[20:57] know God I want to thank you for this
[20:59] job and whenever it's time you know how
[21:06] I'm feeling you know my body just wears
[21:10] down you see brothers he knows those
[21:13] things he knows how you feel but if you
[21:19] just let them know if we're just not not
[21:22] not not vague when we tell him things if
[21:29] we just if we're just a little more
[21:30] specific I should say so much my
[21:32] specific course you know with with the
[21:34] way you talk with them then I think
[21:39] that's that's when that's when he begins
[21:41] to answer because a lot of times which
[21:45] is not specific specifically you know
[21:50] you don't necessarily tell him what you
[21:52] really want a specific comment take a
[21:56] care most and and that's why sometimes
[21:58] you don't get what you want
[22:00] Sciences no tiene look yourself quiere
[22:02] because you're not specific with you so
[22:06] you know when you talk with them you
[22:10] just be specific specific and I think
[22:14] you'll answer I'll just let them know I
[22:20] just decided to be to be in the Fort
[22:22] Collins area you know just to be a bit
[22:27] more with my family not just with my
[22:32] family at home but with my church family
[22:37] as well because you know we're all
[22:41] family here you know in about two or
[22:45] three weeks ago they let me know that I
[22:49] was going to be transferred you know and
[22:53] I just want to thank God you know
[22:57] because he's a God that still answers
[23:00] prayer
[23:06] I just wanted to share that with you you
[23:10] know and I would ask if you just please
[23:14] stand
[23:17] we're gonna be opening our scriptures
[23:22] we're gonna be opening to the to the
[23:24] Book of Isaiah chapter 7 capital oh yeah
[23:33] we're gonna be starting on verse 1 vamos
[23:36] and Posada ever sick alone oh and for a
[23:42] title if I don't eat alone I'd like to
[23:47] title this a half-baked Christian when
[24:00] you have it say Amen it reads like this
[24:04] yes I see this chapter 7 verse 1 assess
[24:11] when I would have healed
[24:13] drill then the iniquity of a frame was
[24:16] discovered and the wickedness of Samaria
[24:19] for they commit falsehood and the tin
[24:23] and the troop of robbers and they
[24:39] consider not in their hearts that I
[24:41] remember all their wickedness now their
[24:43] own doings they are before my face and
[24:55] will move ahead to verse 6 and it says
[25:02] for they have made ready their heart
[25:04] like an oven while they lie in wait
[25:07] their baker sleepeth all the night in
[25:10] the morning it burn it as a flaming fire
[25:12] aplicar on su corazón some ohonta or no
[25:17] artificial enormous or narrow a la
[25:21] mañana Stinson Dida and Sandy DoCoMo
[25:24] llamada Fuego they are all as hot as an
[25:27] oven and have devoured their judges all
[25:30] their kings are fallen there is none
[25:32] among them that calleth unto me this is
[25:43] my domain scripture here I want to be
[25:47] focusing on this frame he has mixed
[25:52] himself among the people frame is a cake
[25:55] not turned strangers have devoured his
[26:04] strength and he no it did not
[26:09] yeah grey hairs are here and there upon
[26:12] him yet he knoweth not and the pride of
[26:18] Israel testifies to his face and they do
[26:21] not return to the Lord their God nor
[26:23] seek him for all this
[26:25] so very odd Israel terrific ara contra
[26:27] el and soukara
[26:29] in Norse La Valle Vieira na Havasu Jose
[26:32] nila who's Karen con todo esto let us
[26:35] bow our heads to pray Heavenly Father we
[26:40] come before you this evening Lord
[26:45] thankful Lord for all you've done
[26:48] we ask to look at the needs of the
[26:51] peoples do you speak this evening you
[26:59] knowing to live they will be speaking
[27:02] the you that you ninety years that will
[27:05] be hearing whether we be here at church
[27:10] or or through the internet may they not
[27:15] not leave here empty Lord but they may
[27:19] they take they take your word in their
[27:21] hearts we ask this on the name of our
[27:25] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[27:30] you may be seated as we read in the
[27:38] scripture the Bible speaks about how
[27:42] Ephraim
[27:43] what was one of the nations or one of
[27:46] the tribes of Israel it was it was it
[27:53] was a tribe that was very a blessed by
[27:55] God they saw God firsthand they saw him
[28:04] at work in the you know when when they
[28:07] crossed the Red Sea he delivered them
[28:12] with the mighty hand mono/poly dosa and
[28:17] but we read in the scripture and verse 2
[28:23] verse 3 how the Godhead was able to see
[28:27] how they had strayed away from him Mira
[28:30] como esta bien separado there after all
[28:33] the blessings after after all the things
[28:37] he done
[28:38] so lo que entra por ellos they just they
[28:41] just they just they just ignored it
[28:43] simplemente like no doubt on they just
[28:46] walked away they decided that they
[28:49] desired to now no longer have a
[28:51] relationship with him they said oh no
[28:52] they don't have relation con el they
[28:54] didn't they just didn't even want to
[28:57] pray anymore you know because we read in
[29:01] the last scripture that they did they no
[29:02] longer sought after him I mean almost
[29:04] unless you throw a kick and we really
[29:08] not in verse 8 how did you know that
[29:13] they got off they got all mixed up
[29:15] almost at my school they mixed up among
[29:19] among the nation you know and we know
[29:23] that God doesn't like mixing he doesn't
[29:29] lead isn't likely doesn't like frees
[29:31] people to mingle with the things of the
[29:33] world or the mix with them and that's
[29:37] something that's not very pleasing to
[29:39] him he wants a relationship with them
[29:43] you know we when we talk about
[29:46] relationship so I sat there and asked
[29:49] myself as I was reading you know we come
[29:55] to church and we sit there sometimes and
[29:58] we think you know when we come to church
[30:02] we think sometimes because we come to
[30:04] church just for getting more solid less
[30:07] here that we have a relationship with
[30:09] God and I was sitting there thinking
[30:14] when you have a relationship with
[30:16] someone you communicate with them and
[30:20] say kumanyika con ellos
[30:22] there's communication and communication
[30:24] and then I began to think about my
[30:26] prayer life happen sudden and maybe that
[30:29] you know and I think we should all
[30:31] consider our prayer line almost
[30:34] considered because if you have know if
[30:37] you're if you don't have a prayer life
[30:39] with you know an IV on that you don't
[30:42] have a relationship with God young con
[30:45] Dios because that's the way you
[30:46] communicate with God Eskimo sacrimoni
[30:49] cacao through prayer
[30:51] poor mayor de la nación that's the way
[30:54] you talk with him I see Eskimos a la
[30:57] Cornell so you look at your prayer life
[30:58] and that'll tell you what kind of
[31:02] relationship you have with God so let me
[31:05] not Katie Palacios Athena con Dios as I
[31:10] was reading I started II III just this
[31:14] brother that I was reading about
[31:18] and he was just he just he just hit me
[31:21] real hard just you know he was he was
[31:25] book the book was saying it was saying
[31:28] you know how many that's the question is
[31:32] how many have you taught your children
[31:35] how to pray
[31:36] those who says learning sinasu sea horse
[31:39] you know that just that just cut me up
[31:42] here so man so it just cut me because I
[31:49] honestly can say that I'm a pray but
[31:55] I've never taught my children how to
[31:57] pray they don't know how to pray and if
[32:02] they don't know how to break how do I
[32:05] expect for them to have a relationship
[32:07] with God I said okay yo song con Dios
[32:12] it's just it's just something that we
[32:14] have to think about many thought we have
[32:18] to get real real really thorough and em
[32:20] escape inside their store not just when
[32:24] I say thorough you know that means that
[32:30] means everything significant although
[32:33] because we see in the scripture limit
[32:37] emotion escritura
[32:38] or our key scripture and I'm gonna read
[32:43] it again it's it's it says like there's
[32:46] a frame he had turned he had mixed
[32:48] himself among the people for him is a
[32:54] cake not turn a phrase torta no volte
[32:58] odda
[32:59] so in other words you
[33:02] when you when you put a cake in the oven
[33:06] you know when they talk about cakes here
[33:11] when they talk about cakes in the in the
[33:15] old time they used to they used to make
[33:19] what you would call like a type of a
[33:21] pancake pancake you know you know it's
[33:27] it's just it's not turned the cake was
[33:30] not turned in other words it there was
[33:36] one side that was burnt and there was
[33:41] another site that was soggy a lot ROI
[33:43] and stuff a lot of stuff oh my lord no
[33:46] actual it was not complete completo and
[33:51] I I started thinking about that you stop
[33:54] and honest you know and that's why I
[33:56] titled it the way I did because a lot of
[34:01] times we cut the church just because we
[34:07] come to church well we think that we're
[34:11] complete it's almost almost completos
[34:13] but it's it's far from that much much
[34:16] lesser so it fits far from that it's
[34:19] much less scarce because the cake has to
[34:23] be turned over right not to be burnt see
[34:29] there's two sides to the cake it's not
[34:32] just one side but there's two sides so
[34:37] we have to pay attention we have to pay
[34:41] attention that we're just not focusing
[34:43] on one side we just can't focus just
[34:48] simply on the outside I don't know
[34:51] that fuera we can't come with your slip
[34:52] we dress the part of a Christian Amano's
[34:55] playmos we're still a part of Christian
[34:57] oil but we have to we have to turn over
[35:00] mascara you have to turn that cake over
[35:02] most a wealthy heiress at door and make
[35:04] sure the fire yeah make sure that that
[35:08] fire that's in their oven he can focus
[35:10] an essay or no begins to penetrate and
[35:13] step Annette Rondo we
[35:15] don't want something just one-sided okay
[35:18] I'm on solid watch on Omar's see God
[35:20] doesn't do things that way okay let's go
[35:23] so sassy
[35:23] he doesn't like things that are just
[35:25] one-sided just just a halfway do thing
[35:35] and we see here in the scripture the
[35:39] referee was just a cake like a cake that
[35:41] was not turned in other words they were
[35:46] double minded put it that way
[35:51] you know grab maybe one day they wanted
[35:54] to serve God and maybe the next day they
[35:58] did it the Bible says that they began to
[36:05] mix themselves up among the nation they
[36:14] began to think about the material things
[36:20] aside you see that's what light that's
[36:25] what happens in life sometimes we just
[36:29] we develop relationship you know whether
[36:35] it be a word outside of church
[36:44] relationship sometimes we have to
[36:48] understand we have to realize what these
[36:55] relationships are doing our spiritual

[42:55] brothers you know we just we just have
[42:58] to watch those things we have to be
[43:03] careful than that cuidado
[43:06] god is good brothers joe says why not we
[43:13] cannot have appearance an appearance of
[43:17] holiness you just only just on the
[43:21] outside Santos not my sport where are
[43:24] you see a preacher could be a saint in
[43:26] public and he could be a devil in
[43:32] private and privado we just have to we
[43:37] just have to remember you know what I
[43:41] heard I heard a preacher say this one
[43:44] time he's like it's easy to go to church
[43:51] do those things you know but when you
[43:55] when you go to your house and you close
[43:58] that door behind you
[44:01] are you the same person in your house
[44:04] that you are outside of your house that
[44:10] oughta sting brothers because it hurts
[44:14] because sometimes that's the way we are
[44:17] you see you're cooked on one side not
[44:23] this not just cook sometimes you're
[44:24] burned on one side you see in your soggy
[44:29] on the other you're just you're just
[44:33] soggy mellow you know we talk about the
[44:39] scripture and you know it uses it uses
[44:43] fire a lot you know it uses it a lot in
[44:48] analogies it's fascinating how many
[44:55] expressions or our thoughts emotions
[45:02] bodies we they're they're used as
[45:05] analogy with fire okay so we talk about
[45:13] getting fired up about an idea being
[45:20] excited about burning with an idea
[45:23] yeah or you know we have a burning
[45:26] desire perhaps we have a burning passion
[45:33] John Chrysostom on dope or then throw or
[45:36] baby a bird up with anger or sestak a
[45:38] manic on Quora here you see it all has
[45:40] to do with fire Talton a cancer corn
[45:42] flavor you see the physical fire it has
[45:45] the potential to the whole people in
[45:48] favor physical channel a potential decay
[45:51] Meritor muchas cosas so I believe it the
[45:53] spiritual fire is the same way don't
[45:56] settle for spirituality la misma manera
[45:59] you see we have to watch those passions
[46:03] what are you passionate about okay now
[46:07] stir and nonsense you see we can talk
[46:09] about sexual passions are they
[46:11] passionate sex you know
[46:13] if you're just burning up yeah this is
[46:15] just a commando port and you know we
[46:18] know what I could lead to but you have
[46:22] to watch you see because what we want
[46:27] the fire inside to do we wanted to burn
[46:32] all sin we wanted to burn to burn that's
[46:38] within us
[46:39] you see what we want to fire inside of
[46:42] us we wanted to take us to to live a
[46:48] holy line I must confer knows yet very
[46:50] video Navi that Santa but I believe that
[46:54] we can't live a holy life without a
[46:58] prayer life I believe they go hand in
[47:02] hand we have to have a prayer life to
[47:09] have a holy life so we have to
[47:14] constantly be praying Santa meant
[47:17] autonomous cast-iron or ASEAN because if
[47:19] not for casino the fire and the fire
[47:24] inside could hurt us something else
[47:25] Martita an algo mas and you could be
[47:28] consumed with within but we want that
[47:34] fire the motivator
[47:36] no somos TV how many believe that
[47:40] brothers answer Manos we go back to the
[47:45] scripture about a frame a frame and we
[47:49] see here me Ramos how did God remain God
[47:53] we have a God that remembers how many
[47:58] how many you're happy to know that the
[48:02] sovereign saw that we have a God that
[48:04] remembers you see he remembers his
[48:09] promises he remembers his children but
[48:15] sometimes we forget we forget to mention
[48:18] sometimes that he remembers his curses
[48:22] as well
[48:24] recorded esas medicinas tambien he
[48:26] remembers those things and we have
[48:30] plenty of time to repent he's a God that
[48:35] forgives but he's a god that remembers
[48:41] he remembers those he remembers his
[48:44] curses as well as malice yonas a mallet
[48:50] excuse me brothers we see here in the
[48:58] scripture about God how he remembers the
[49:04] Prophet says in the seventh seal he says
[49:09] just as sure as he remembers every good
[49:11] promise I said a promise he remembers
[49:15] every evil one two he said that's the
[49:20] reason I believe friends I've always
[49:24] tried to stay with that word how strange
[49:30] it seems no matter how strange it seems
[49:35] brothers we have to stay with that word
[49:40] we have to make sure that we're they
[49:45] were paying attention the most poignant
[49:47] nothing that we're just not we're just
[49:49] not we're just being cooked on both
[49:51] sides you know and we see here in the
[49:56] scripture how he speaks
[50:01] how he speaks above that cake and I
[50:07] don't know if I'm gonna finish or not
[50:10] but we see in the scripture that you
[50:15] know to make a cake but I said so you
[50:19] you have to have you have to have a
[50:20] flower you know and I see in the
[50:25] scripture in the message Elijah in the
[50:28] mail offering
[50:31] and the Prophet says this it says now
[50:37] she got to me which represented Christ
[50:42] Christ is the word in the beginning was
[50:47] the word the Word was with God and the
[50:52] Word was God and the Word was made flesh
[50:55] and dwelt among Christ the meal
[51:00] offerings
[51:02] then she went and got the oil and the
[51:07] oil represents the spirit represented so
[51:11] she put the word in the spirit together
[51:14] and began to mix it up my swamis clothes
[51:19] see it was the word in the spirit that
[51:22] got mixed together
[51:23] LSPD took a mess cloth but what happened
[51:27] with every episo-- Conniff Raheen is
[51:30] that he he started he started mixing it
[51:34] with other things él comenzó my second
[51:37] otras cosas it wasn't it was no longer
[51:39] just a spirit John oh I don't know
[51:41] Marcel espírito you see he began to use
[51:43] to use maybe maybe human human strength
[51:49] you see just just like the human desire
[51:53] to want to do something oil - oh ma no
[51:55] they made a doll was that that's exactly
[52:00] what it is brothers yes you have to let
[52:02] God work you have to let him do the
[52:06] mixing Housatonic a lomez player you see
[52:11] when it is needed
[52:12] but no some masado media needed some
[52:18] asado so you have to let him get that
[52:21] oil in there so it can be completely
[52:26] saturated with that oil which is the
[52:32] spirit yes el espíritu
[52:33] see we know that yes our mo says so
[52:36] that's what the Prophet said lo que es
[52:39] el Profeta amen
[52:42] man brothers I know it's Wednesday minus
[52:45] x-one miércoles ro but I'm feeling a
[52:48] little hot man we see here brothers that
[53:00] a frame after he got mixed up after he
[53:07] got mixed up with with with these other
[53:09] nations that that didn't believe in
[53:12] their God then believing it frames God
[53:17] you see they begin to lose their
[53:20] strength little by little the scripture
[53:26] says that they begin to get gray hairs
[53:32] they started getting gray hairs on us
[53:38] but to get gray hairs brothers to be
[53:42] able to notice them you see you have to
[53:47] have a mirror who sat in a cast and I
[53:49] don't expect home that's the I mean I
[53:53] know I'm losing my hair some gray hairs
[53:58] right here on the side I wouldn't be
[54:02] able to see him I wouldn't be able to
[54:05] see him if I didn't have a mirror you
[54:09] see it I believe it's the same way in
[54:10] the spiritual life you see you can't you
[54:14] can't see your sins you see if you don't
[54:17] have the mirror of God in front of you
[54:21] you see that's the thing that's the most
[54:23] neglected yes that's the thing that we
[54:30] don't pay attention to we don't pay it
[54:34] we have a lot of unread Bibles you see
[54:38] it and they'll cry out against us one
[54:40] day
[54:42] [Music]
[54:45] they'll they'll cry out against us one
[54:48] day you see because that's really what's
[54:51] gonna let you know that's really good
[54:55] what I'm gonna let you know what were
[54:56] your standing on this what's wrong with
[55:00] you what did you have in your life you
[55:07] see he sends us he sent us instruments
[55:09] gauges you know to be able to analyze to
[55:16] be able to analyze our lives that's
[55:21] exactly what it is and I have I have a
[55:26] story I want to share with you and it's
[55:31] about a pilot you know I think it was
[55:35] very interesting you see this pilot said
[55:40] sometimes you see this pilot was in the
[55:45] Navy and you see they had depth watching
[55:49] their instrument in the end their gauges
[55:54] because they had to fly at night not
[55:58] share
[55:59] you see these pilots had to fly during
[56:01] the night time so Spilotro swallow under
[56:03] no chair you see any pilot can make some
[56:05] critical mistakes while he's flying at
[56:07] night a lot of where Sarah knows if he
[56:14] starts operating by his senses yeah he
[56:18] knows airport so Santino's you see
[56:20] that's where he begins to make a
[56:22] critical error is for now sooner or
[56:24] critical because the body begins to
[56:26] adjust purpose who star it says you know
[56:30] the body was just so much that a pilot
[56:32] could be flying upside down and feel
[56:35] that he's right side up al cuerpo Sahu
[56:37] stop mucho el Piloto La Valle and
[56:41] awoka-woka Riva Paris Ibaka bajo you see
[56:44] a Leicester pilot he as he begins to
[56:46] pour on the stick pelota hollando
[56:50] and menu that remote that he has he
[56:57] think he's flying up LPN circus towel
[57:00] and oh sorry
[57:01] because he's going by his senses a poor
[57:03] susanti dose you see but but but really
[57:06] he's keep flying down mentis Tasha I
[57:10] wonder if that's not how it is sometimes
[57:12] with us nosotros Ave you see we start
[57:16] going by we think we're on good terms
[57:18] with God when someone says ammos and
[57:20] terminals windows con Dios we could we
[57:22] can think all we want to because just
[57:26] because we think a certain way it
[57:29] doesn't mean that it's right no
[57:30] significant esta bien
[57:32] it doesn't mean that it's right if it's
[57:35] not according to the word it's not right
[57:37] a lot on north ivn we could be wrong
[57:40] brothers well I must have started mine
[57:42] I've got plenty of tickets I've got
[57:47] plenty of tickets where I thought I was
[57:49] right which was dinky that skip and
[57:52] sickest rvn but let escape and say I
[57:55] didn't think I was going very fast but I
[58:00] was pero si and that's just the way it
[58:03] is brothers you could think all you want
[58:05] to but we see this pilot I don't mean I
[58:09] mustn't step alot he begins to pour on
[58:11] the stick he thinks he's climbing in
[58:18] altitude altitude and he's flying
[58:22] straight into the ground yes londo that
[58:25] hecho el piso
[58:26] you see that's the same with the
[58:28] spiritual life like I said yes not miss
[58:30] well I mean a spirit well it's the same
[58:33] way as la misma
[58:35] we have to have a balance brothers and I
[58:38] must get an animal and say we have to
[58:40] have that balance in our lives an
[58:43] imbalance in Ezra's Vedas you know
[58:46] brothers they began if rain began at
[58:50] mano Safra income and so they begin to
[58:52] be strangers strangers to God estrellas
[58:57] con Dios you see the word stranger you
[59:02] see that the me
[59:03] is to be a foreigner Fiona said on the
[59:09] biblically the word refers to an alien
[59:11] or strange
[59:18] what one day has worship worship
[59:21] practices just one who is not a member
[59:27] of a family or no canines miembro de una
[59:29] familia it says or the state of being
[59:31] estranged from one's land or people that
[59:34] supported a suti era or the soup
[59:38] sometimes it's estrangement rssss is
[59:44] chosen SS Kohi de as when God's people
[59:47] I see commodious deliberately turn away
[59:50] from him and they make themselves
[59:55] strangers see there were there were no
[1:00:01] longer turning brothers there were no
[1:00:05] longer turning to God that's why that's
[1:00:09] why they were all soggy
[1:00:12] like that that's why once I was our
[1:00:14] Birds cocinando you see okay mother
[1:00:19] neither was there was just a lot of
[1:00:20] hypocrisy a lot of ungodliness outward
[1:00:26] performance is what it was but inside
[1:00:31] they were lukewarm you see and they were
[1:00:35] spoiled they were right in those like I
[1:00:42] said burnt on one side Monica come on
[1:00:44] lado damp or the other
[1:00:46] yeah mellow cilantro what do you do with
[1:00:49] the bird que pasa con una pastel que
[1:00:54] mató you see what do you do with the
[1:00:55] bird pancake I said corn on pancake and
[1:00:58] Milo you throw it away brothers it's
[1:01:03] spoiled hopper there it's only fit to go
[1:01:06] to the trash I was reading you see in in
[1:01:12] the in the in the New Living Translation
[1:01:16] vivianne you know and I like the way it
[1:01:19] said it there's just really no easy way
[1:01:22] to put it I know I you see the way it
[1:01:27] says it is is like this he says esta
[1:01:30] manera it is the people of Israel mingle
[1:01:32] with godless foreigners in Israel plucky
[1:01:38] comic embark on extra heroes making
[1:01:44] themselves as worthless as a half-baked
[1:01:46] cake you see we don't want to mingle
[1:01:54] with the things of the world we don't
[1:01:59] want we don't want that for our kids you
[1:02:06] see we don't want that for it but we
[1:02:07] don't want it for ourselves either we
[1:02:11] have to watch those things we don't want
[1:02:15] our kids to do something we want to
[1:02:19] protect them and that's great but make
[1:02:23] sure that you're not mingling with the
[1:02:25] with the things of the world either make
[1:02:31] sure you have a relationship you see the
[1:02:36] Prophet talks about a little bit I like
[1:02:38] what he talks about here in the message
[1:02:43] the approach to God it says and all of
[1:02:51] my parents know what a feeling that is
[1:02:56] and all of we parents know what a
[1:02:59] feeling that is it says when your
[1:03:04] children are cuando sus hijos you're
[1:03:07] very hard you're very hard begins to
[1:03:13] mingle with the world get out among the
[1:03:18] believers get out among the unbelievers
[1:03:24] North Korean III says he was talking
[1:03:28] about his son Billy I saw under the so
[1:03:31] he called Billy and he says I think he's
[1:03:32] out maybe talking to brother would put
[1:03:37] in our city we do not have we do not
[1:03:39] have a Christian school but honestly I
[1:03:42] don't mo so Mike

[1:03:51] about sending Billy to school yeah let's
[1:03:53] uh pensando there are a billion escuela

[1:03:57] my boy to that school this is knowing
[1:04:02] that everything that I drilled into him
[1:04:05] locate Lansing yeah and unless he
[1:04:07] becomes really converted Munoz casa he
[1:04:11] really comes to Christ all of his nature
[1:04:15] would be would be changed he swept out
[1:04:21] from under my hands as soon as he got
[1:04:28] with those worldly bunch because the
[1:04:33] very nature in him no matter being a
[1:04:38] good boy that is having a minister
[1:04:42] father a religious home where we don't
[1:04:48] approve of any things of the world in
[1:04:49] our home we try to live by the grace of
[1:04:56] God that almost every video like I said
[1:04:58] that you like Christians ought to live

[1:05:57] Boniface nature isn't changed he will go
[1:06:02] right on just the same how I think of
[1:06:06] the other day a como pienso del that
[1:06:09] Billy entered high school you see he'd
[1:06:13] been baptized but he'd never made a full
[1:06:17] surrender he never made a full
[1:06:21] consecration to Christ knowing that the
[1:06:25] nature of a child was yet in him how my
[1:06:31] heart yearned for him and how I pray God
[1:06:37] my car and right around and say God
[1:06:43] don't let my good boy get wrapped up in
[1:06:45] that kind of stuff out there you see
[1:06:50] brothers we don't want to get mingled in

[1:07:01] believe it hurts God as well Yoast
[1:07:04] ambien to see us you know in a condition
[1:07:10] in the condition where is sometimes
[1:07:13] where everything's just one-sided where
[1:07:18] everything we were our prayers are so
[1:07:21] just one side we just we just pray for
[1:07:25] what we want but honestly you know our
[1:07:31] prayers
[1:07:33] you see we should pray that so that we
[1:07:36] should get to know him more to know what
[1:07:40] he likes not just what we want okay
[1:07:45] they see us because you know if we
[1:07:48] praetor simply for what we want you know
[1:07:53] we know that they're not right a lot of
[1:07:55] the times I must commercialize SS no
[1:07:57] Sunday sauce correct oh yeah we know

[1:08:02] Christians I believe have to overcome
[1:08:04] okay Christian OC n K so as you have to
[1:08:09] overcome those things in one way or
[1:08:14] another and it's very difficult
[1:08:18] yes muy difficile it's very hard
[1:08:21] brothers it's muy difícil hermanos
[1:08:24] brothers I want to invite you to please

[1:08:36] to make sure that we want to make sure
[1:08:42] where we're going in the right direction
[1:08:45] correcta you know and as I finish I just
[1:08:53] I wanted to share one more thing
[1:08:55] compartir una cosa mas you know this is
[1:08:59] an old fable as a sunnah fabula your
[1:09:02] fables something that's not real here's
[1:09:06] something that you know that that that
[1:09:08] it's not it's just not real but I'm
[1:09:12] gonna share this fable because I really
[1:09:17] like what it says in this fables about
[1:09:21] the way Birds got their wings in the
[1:09:23] beginning in this fable says that the
[1:09:35] birds were made without wings but we
[1:09:41] know that's not true
[1:09:43] but then God made wings and put them
[1:09:45] down before the wingless Birds and said
[1:09:52] to them Alessi ho it says come take up
[1:09:55] these burdens and bear them don't mine
[1:09:57] estas scaring us
[1:10:00] and bear them the birds have lovely
[1:10:06] plumage and sweet voices they could sing
[1:10:14] when encantar and their feathers gleamed
[1:10:17] in the sunshine a blue mass but they
[1:10:23] could not soar in the air they hesitated
[1:10:29] at first they hesitated when they were
[1:10:34] asked to take up these burdens that lay
[1:10:36] at their feet yes it says but soon they
[1:10:42] obeyed pero temprano of el ser on taking
[1:10:46] up the wings in their beaks
[1:10:47] tomando Susa las conchas Pecos they laid
[1:10:51] them on their shoulders to carry their
[1:10:52] own ancestors palace
[1:10:55] it's just for a little while to load
[1:10:56] seemed heavy and hard to bear but
[1:11:05] presently as they we're not carrying the
[1:11:09] burdens folding them over their hearts
[1:11:14] londo licentious corazones it says the
[1:11:17] wings grew fast to their little bodies
[1:11:19] scrappy las Chico's and soon they
[1:11:22] discovered how to use them and we're
[1:11:28] lifted by them up into the air the
[1:11:32] weights became wings
[1:11:35] it is a parable it says we are the
[1:11:39] wingless Birds almost lost Pajero seen
[1:11:41] our lives and our duties in tasks or the
[1:11:48] pina or the pinions God has made to lift
[1:11:50] us up somos las cosas para que nose su
[1:11:55] Vanessa and carry us heavenward we look
[1:12:00] at our burdens and heavy loads and
[1:12:05] shrink from them
[1:12:07] semo's chico said today yes but as we
[1:12:10] lift them and bind them about our heart
[1:12:18] they become wings and on them we rise
[1:12:24] and sword toward God since there is no
[1:12:29] burden which if we lift it up cheerfully
[1:12:36] and bear it with love in our hearts will
[1:12:42] not become a blessing to us God means
[1:12:46] arch has to be our helpers it says to
[1:12:52] refuse to bend our shoulders to receive
[1:12:58] a load is to decline a new opportunity
[1:13:01] for growth as brothers I think we all
[1:13:11] have burdens and I think they all get
[1:13:15] happy sometimes but if we're willing to
[1:13:21] pick up those burdens and trust in God
[1:13:25] Almighty just do things cheerfully you
[1:13:33] know and try to grow use them as growth
[1:13:40] then one day those burdens will take us
