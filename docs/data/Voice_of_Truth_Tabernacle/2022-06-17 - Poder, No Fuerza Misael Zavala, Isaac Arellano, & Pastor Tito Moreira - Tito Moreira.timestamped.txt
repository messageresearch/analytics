[21:29] if you can follow me
[21:31] open up your bibles
[21:34] to the book of acts
[21:36] 7 34.
[21:40] i want to give thanks to the lord
[21:56] acts of the apostle 734
[22:10] i estimated
[22:24] the affliction of my people which is in
[22:26] egypt and i have heard they're groaning
[22:29] and i am
[22:30] and i have come down to deliver them and
[22:32] now come i will send thee into egypt
[22:34] this moses whom they refuse saying
[22:37] who may be a ruler and a judge the same
[22:40] did god send to be a ruler and a
[22:42] deliverer by the hand of the angel which
[22:44] appeared to him in the bush
[22:52] that's the title um
[22:56] my brother isaac mr pastor and our
[22:58] pastor
[23:00] and i we have placed poser
[23:05] power not strength not force
[23:20] that
[23:31] the people of israel were in slavery
[23:34] but
[23:38] but moses had a
[23:40] godly mother
[23:43] that since the beginning
[23:45] he says she began to speak to moses
[24:13] a delivery would come
[24:22] his mother began to testify to him
[24:28] with her and her husband
[24:30] biendo
[24:57] and the woman conceived and bear a son
[24:59] and when she saw him that he was a godly
[25:01] child she hit him for three months
[25:11] significa extraordinary
[25:13] the word beautiful in greek is alteos
[25:16] which means extraordinary
[25:21] extraordinary moses had an extraordinary
[25:24] birth
[25:27] the bible said it was beautiful
[25:31] but all the children are beautiful when
[25:32] they're born
[25:34] algriego
[25:36] so in the word greek
[25:39] it shows
[26:02] and the sermon israel at the red sea
[26:04] says that moses had a very peculiar
[26:06] birth
[26:22] peculiar
[26:35] because you can see that this
[26:49] that's something extraordinary
[26:51] yes
[26:54] and that's how i want to compare with
[26:56] the birth of moses
[26:58] also his mom gave testimony
[27:04] of how by through god's guidance
[27:08] she placed him in the river
[27:11] this hermann obradon brother branham
[27:13] says
[27:14] he says and the teachings of moses
[27:30] the lord already had had ready ten
[27:32] thousand angels
[27:34] to take care of him watch over him
[27:40] then the mother told him how he he
[27:42] arrived to the daughter of the pharaoh
[27:45] he was hebrew esclavo
[28:05] that when she saw moses he stole her
[28:07] heart
[28:09] all this was
[28:12] working
[28:17] but also mother moses mother had
[28:20] enough faith
[28:23] to place him in the river
[28:26] if she hadn't placed him in the rivers
[28:30] they were killing all the children
[28:32] and brother brandon places in this way
[28:37] that if she wouldn't have given them up
[28:39] or given it to who she gave him
[28:42] she would have
[28:54] he returned to him
[28:59] why because she took care of moses
[29:03] with all of this
[29:06] moses
[29:09] had so much theology today
[29:22] but he tried to deliver the people of
[29:23] israel with his own knowledge
[29:31] but moses wasn't really the truly
[29:33] deliverer
[29:36] in fiesla substances
[29:40] and faith is the substance preaching
[29:42] 47. of course
[29:52] ben
[30:05] was it god or moses who freed the people
[30:08] it was god in moses
[30:19] undone
[30:26] they cried out for the deliverer and
[30:28] when god sent them the deliverer they
[30:30] failed to see it because it was through
[30:32] a man but he was not a man it was god in
[30:35] a man do you believe that moses was the
[30:37] diver because of his wit and
[30:39] intelligence well he said was a slow man
[30:42] to talk he was
[30:44] he was god in moses a gift to the people
[30:46] he was god in christ he said it is not i
[30:49] it is my father who dwells in me
[30:54] moses was born to be a deliverer
[30:59] before the foundation of the earth
[31:02] it was his commission
[31:15] he based it on his own knowledge
[31:19] everything he had in his head
[31:23] everything that his mother and father
[31:24] and witnesses had told them
[31:27] he didn't have the revelation
[31:30] and sometimes that's the way we are
[31:33] we have the bible
[31:34] we have the message
[31:37] but we don't have the revelation
[31:40] we can have scriptures memorized
[31:44] but if we don't have the revelation we
[31:45] have nothing
[31:47] his mother su padre his father
[31:51] or any uterus
[31:53] including the minister
[31:57] no one can give you the revelation le
[31:58] pueden
[32:12] but no
[32:26] through the holy spirit
[32:41] when and simon peter answered and said
[32:43] thou art the christ the son of the
[32:45] living god entos
[32:47] jesus
[32:54] christ
[32:56] and jesus answered and said blessed are
[32:58] thou art simon for flesh and blood
[33:01] had not revealed it unto thee but my
[33:03] father which is in heaven
[33:07] when did moses receive this revelation
[33:10] when he was with the burning bush
[33:15] there is where he received the
[33:16] revelation everything that was told to
[33:18] him
[33:24] he was able to see the purpose that it
[33:25] wasn't to glorify man
[33:36] israel mystery of moses that it was in
[33:40] god but god had called him
[33:44] entonces
[33:46] so we're seeing
[34:03] preaching
[34:21] you're trying to do it with your own
[34:22] strengths
[34:26] you don't have the holy spirit
[34:32] so that that can be able so you can
[34:33] glorify god
[34:36] we all need of the holy spirit
[34:39] to have an experience with god
[34:43] when moses had his experience with god
[34:45] this is
[35:00] straight from
[35:28] a
[35:42] i believe that the youth here have a lot
[35:43] to give apart
[35:46] aside from what you're already doing
[35:51] every time you have a conference with
[35:52] god i believe you can do it even better
[35:54] wow
[35:56] when
[36:10] that was my first experience with the
[36:11] whole my first sprint with the holy
[36:13] spirit and that's amazing in that same
[36:15] church my second experience my second
[36:17] experience
[36:20] was with the
[36:22] laying of hands
[36:31] and they placed the youth they put me
[36:33] with the youth of 16 17 year olds
[36:37] that was my second experience
[36:51] but you have to surrender
[36:55] you have to let go of the eye
[36:59] you have to go to that burning bush
[37:01] we need reverence
[37:03] go with faith
[37:53] but there is something about god that he
[37:55] impels man to do things that are beyond
[37:57] any thought of his own so that it may be
[38:00] to the glory and honor of god and i
[38:03] think that not an honor of my own but i
[38:05] think that it was a privilege to leave
[38:07] everything that was dear to me to get
[38:09] here in the to get here in this desert
[38:11] and suffer as i have never suffered in
[38:12] my life
[38:14] here in this loneliness or the desert
[38:16] but i believe that by doing that
[38:19] and by obeying what god commanded to
[38:21] be done god has opened to us the
[38:24] mysteries of this last day
[38:25] and here we are with this message
[38:29] that for all that we have learned
[38:32] everything has been preached to us
[38:42] but you're never going to be able to
[38:43] finish your purpose
[38:58] the true purpose of god
[39:02] which is to honor him and glory to him
[39:07] then you will be able to have power from
[39:08] god
[39:11] but you have to be able to let go
[39:24] [Music]
[39:26] and i believe
[39:40] thank you and
[39:44] [Applause]
[39:49] god bless you brothers
[39:52] god is good
[39:55] [Music]
[40:05] i would like to get warmed up here
[40:22] it is a privilege to be here tonight
[40:28] i thank my pastor and also god
[40:31] for this opportunity
[40:36] i will be changing my my language here
[40:39] to english uh god bless our brother
[40:41] missael
[40:44] um
[40:45] god can use any one of us amen
[41:04] and can i hear our title for this night
[41:11] power not force
[41:14] all together amen let's let's be here
[41:16] like we want to wait man
[41:30] where did moses receive the revelation
[41:37] and this is where i start my message
[41:41] and it was one of the most momentous
[41:42] days in israel history
[41:50] [Music]
[41:54] when moses called when god called moses
[42:00] from a burning
[42:12] so moses is 80 years old
[42:17] now i'm kind of
[42:18] i'm going to paint you a story now if
[42:20] you just want to work your imagination
[42:27] moses is in the wilderness
[42:41] a burning bush
[42:51] he immediately
[42:52] something unusual noticed something
[42:54] unusual
[43:08] comes close to the bush and god speaks
[43:10] to him
[43:38] think about it meritelo god spoke to
[43:41] moses through the bush
[43:45] and he tells him moses i got a job for
[43:48] you
[43:50] i want you to go back to egypt
[44:19] and now we know he tells the lord his
[44:21] incapabilities
[44:26] how many have been there quantos
[44:29] hey man let's be honest
[44:31] let's participate vamos a participation
[44:34] god
[45:02] says in chapter four verse
[45:05] two of exodus
[45:09] just uh i'm not gonna read it just
[45:11] narrating
[45:13] he says what is in your hand moses
[45:20] he said
[45:22] god told moses throw it down
[45:24] he says
[45:25] and we know what happened right now
[45:29] became a serpent second
[45:35] because the bible says he fled from it
[45:41] and smart people run from snakes
[46:12] trusting
[46:21] for you to understand moses is here
[46:23] because he already tried it by force
[46:25] aura
[46:46] [Music]
[47:14] now moses didn't have biblical
[47:16] instruction about how to turn sticks
[47:18] into snakes
[47:22] no sevilla
[47:26] moses didn't have a biblical instruction
[47:31] to turn sticks into snakes or snakes
[47:34] into the states
[47:46] that's not found anywhere in the
[47:48] textbook
[48:02] so what was god trying to tell moses
[48:25] just as god told moses go preach
[48:27] deliverance
[48:31] mark 16 says
[48:34] uh
[48:36] jesus tells us to go and preach the
[48:38] gospel
[48:42] do we have the gospel or not
[48:45] if you're not sure this night
[48:53] [Music]
[48:57] but when we have the message of the
[48:59] deliverance
[49:21] amen amen
[49:25] it was by baptism of the cloud era
[49:28] la
[49:41] we have the message of deliverance
[50:10] because what god actually said to moses
[50:15] let's just go and preach the message
[50:18] and i'll do whatever needs to be done
[50:23] now this time it wasn't moses doing
[50:26] things
[50:30] it was god doing things
[50:34] god says if i need to turn sticks into
[50:36] snakes
[51:20] hallelujah
[51:41] and
[51:42] when
[51:43] i can relate when my pastor tells me to
[51:45] do something
[52:16] whatever
[52:44] gracias there shouldn't be no doubt no
[52:48] no
[52:50] if god spoke his word
[52:53] that's final is
[52:56] tell your neighbor
[52:58] he
[53:08] five minutes i need to be closing now
[53:11] he finally comes before
[53:22] and he didn't know if pharaoh was going
[53:23] to respond positively to his request
[53:37] that when he showed him that stick trick
[53:39] quick
[53:48] he was going to listen to moses amen
[53:55] here's moses uh trusting that with this
[53:57] trick he's gonna deliver his people and
[54:00] i imagine pharaoh saying
[54:04] after moses telling him to free the
[54:07] people
[54:21] and you think you come and tell
[54:55] and it says it is second timothy 3.
[55:02] now as janice and james will still moses
[55:05] so do these also resist the truth
[55:16] or using the same methods
[55:39] [Applause]
[55:41] brought their rods and their rods became
[55:43] serpents
[55:46] bars
[57:23] did so and the lord commanded and he
[57:25] lifted up the rod and smoked the waters
[57:26] that were in the river in the sight of
[57:28] pharaoh and in the sight of his servants
[57:30] and all the waters that were in the
[57:31] river were turned to blood
[57:46] and the fish that were in the river died
[57:48] and the river stank and the egyptians
[57:49] could not drink of the water of the
[57:51] river and there was blood throughout all
[57:53] the land of egypt
[58:05] and the magicians of egypt did so with
[58:07] their enchantments and pharaoh's heart
[58:09] was hardened neither did he hearken unto
[58:11] them as the lord had said
[58:15] i don't have the next verse
[58:17] uh verse 22.
[58:22] and now skipping to the next verse
[58:24] exodus 8-6
[58:29] and aaron stretched out his hand over
[58:31] the waters of egypt and the frogs came
[58:32] up and covered the land of egypt in tons
[58:42] and the magicians did so with their
[58:43] enchantments and brought out frogs from
[58:45] the land of egypt
[58:54] then pharaoh called moses and aaron and
[58:56] said and treat the lord that he may take
[58:58] away the frogs from me and from my
[59:00] people and i will let the people go that
[59:02] they may do sacrifice unto the lord
[59:04] entonces
[59:17] now in verse 16 moses is still not
[59:19] stopping
[59:23] and moses and the lord said unto moses
[59:25] saying sarah stretch out thy rod and
[59:27] smite the dust of the land that it may
[59:28] become lies throughout all the land of
[59:30] egypt
[59:40] and they did so far and stretched out
[59:42] his hand with the rod and smoked the
[59:43] dust of the earth and it became licensed
[59:45] man and in beast all the dust of the
[59:47] land became lies throughout all the land
[59:49] of egypt
[1:00:11] and the magicians did so with their
[1:00:13] enchantments to bring forth lies
[1:00:23] let's read it all together
[1:00:26] but they
[1:00:27] [Music]
[1:00:28] [Applause]
[1:00:41] you're probably saying brother isaac
[1:00:43] what are you saying
[1:00:46] here's what i'm trying to say
[1:00:49] they may duplicate something
[1:00:52] they may seem to be ahead of us
[1:01:34] they can't keep up with the true
[1:01:35] messenger
[1:02:16] god bless
[1:02:21] [Applause]
[1:02:32] verse
[1:02:51] now moses kept the flock of jethro his
[1:02:53] father-in-law the priest of midian and
[1:02:55] he led the flock to the backside of the
[1:02:57] desert and came to the mount of god even
[1:02:59] to orb is
[1:03:11] and the angel of the lord appeared to
[1:03:13] him in a flame of fire out of the midst
[1:03:15] of the bush and he looked and behold the
[1:03:17] bush burned with fire and the bush was
[1:03:19] not consumed
[1:03:28] and moses said i will now turn aside and
[1:03:30] see this great sight why the bush is not
[1:03:32] burned
[1:03:42] and when the lord saw that he turned
[1:03:43] aside to see god called unto him out of
[1:03:45] the midst of the bush and said moses
[1:03:47] moses what he said and he said here am i
[1:03:57] and he said draw now draw not nigh
[1:03:59] hither
[1:04:01] put off thy shoes from off thy feet for
[1:04:03] the place where on thou stand is his
[1:04:04] holy ground
[1:04:16] he said i am the god of thy father of
[1:04:18] the god of abra the god of abraham the
[1:04:20] god of isaac and the god of jacob and
[1:04:22] moses hid his face and was afraid to
[1:04:24] look upon god
[1:04:26] you may be seated
[1:04:34] power not force
[1:04:38] i was reading
[1:04:41] something someone said once okay
[1:04:47] how you do something
[1:04:52] you do everything
[1:05:21] he cares more about how i do things
[1:05:24] than the things that i do important
[1:05:27] he cares how i come to treasury
[1:05:32] he cares how i preach important
[1:05:48] uh
[1:07:09] [Applause]
[1:07:10] our lives
[1:07:26] one of the greatest
[1:07:41] me
[1:07:43] three million people
[1:07:46] it's hard to guide on or lead our own
[1:07:48] home
[1:07:50] sometimes our own children don't want to
[1:07:52] follow us
[1:07:54] guys
[1:08:14] it must have been an extraordinary man
[1:08:20] he tried to do it in his first 40 years
[1:08:21] of life
[1:10:00] likes to meet
[1:10:14] old
[1:10:16] god finds moses
[1:10:25] hacienda different i mean everything
[1:10:28] different
[1:10:39] he was different than when he's now in
[1:10:41] the wilderness
[1:10:58] what i used to
[1:11:00] think i controlled
[1:11:03] medic
[1:11:05] i found out is controlling me
[1:11:11] when i thought of being free
[1:11:13] that i was being free
[1:11:15] medic
[1:11:18] i noticed i was a slave
[1:11:35] that's where moses found himself
[1:11:38] understanding
[1:12:05] what you thought you were controlling
[1:12:07] was that actually
[1:12:10] when you changed your mentality
[1:12:17] who understand that many times we are
[1:12:19] the ones in bondage
[1:12:48] what i thought i wasn't worth no lo que
[1:12:51] pense que no alias what i thought wasn't
[1:12:53] worth anything what i thought wasn't
[1:12:55] worth anything
[1:12:59] was worth more than riches
[1:13:06] when i thought
[1:13:07] of not having anything that i had
[1:13:09] nothing that i had nothing
[1:13:14] medicuenta
[1:13:24] this is where moses is found
[1:13:28] in the place
[1:13:43] you notice that that place is immensely
[1:13:45] full of god
[1:13:47] and that it's a holy place
[1:13:53] that's where moses was
[1:13:58] his mentality had changed
[1:14:03] he didn't see things the way he used to
[1:14:07] do
[1:14:09] now god speaks through to him through a
[1:14:11] bush all right
[1:14:15] now he's not speaking to him from a big
[1:14:18] oak tree
[1:14:20] no let's have lando
[1:14:22] de pino he's not speaking swim through a
[1:14:24] great pine tree leaves
[1:15:08] something very weak
[1:15:12] and god says through the week
[1:15:15] i will show you my powers
[1:15:20] this is what had to change in moses's
[1:15:22] mind
[1:15:25] because it wasn't what he was doing that
[1:15:27] was wrong
[1:15:34] he was doing it
[1:15:37] it was in the wrong manner
[1:15:40] you remember the canaanite woman
[1:15:42] jesus christ
[1:15:47] and it comes to the lord jesus
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:11] [Applause]
[1:16:30] but it says when she changed what she
[1:16:31] was
[1:17:14] but when
[1:17:28] the dogs
[1:17:56] esperanto
[1:18:10] humble and small place you can think of
[1:18:13] not moses
[1:18:17] begins to question god
[1:18:22] this can't be yo no no my pleasure
[1:19:32] is
[1:20:02] moses just obtains
[1:20:05] prophets i can't go on my own
[1:20:16] my name
[1:21:10] i am
[1:21:26] i
[1:21:52] what matters
[1:21:54] is
[1:23:44] that's right
[1:24:27] but god had chosen the foolish things
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:34] you
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:42] [Applause]
[1:27:08] [Applause]
[1:27:16] is and the base things of the world and
[1:27:19] things which are despised have got
[1:27:21] chosen
[1:27:23] and things which are not
[1:27:26] so bring to not things that are affined
[1:27:32] that no flesh should glory in his
[1:27:34] presence
[1:27:35] i want to tell you this
[1:27:38] this is the problem that we're a failure
[1:27:42] it's because we have too much demacia
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:55] glory in his presence
[1:28:08] too much pride to come to the altar
[1:28:12] so much
[1:28:25] so much pride
[1:28:38] you can do so many things
[1:28:54] who is
[1:29:36] when moses
[1:29:37] regress
[1:29:39] returns to egypt
[1:29:44] he is different
[1:30:13] that was greater than anything egypt
[1:30:15] could offer el polio
[1:30:17] he could offer them god
[1:30:27] please
[1:30:32] now uh
[1:30:54] it wasn't moses anymore
[1:30:57] it was i am
[1:31:10] a revelation of who jesus christ is
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:01] i don't want to get very good
[1:32:04] i just want to ask you
[1:32:06] who is with you
[1:32:10] who
[1:32:24] the decisions
[1:32:33] or have you done them alone
[1:32:39] now this man wasn't alone anymore
[1:32:43] with moses
[1:32:46] was the great i am
[1:32:50] and he was the center of everything
[1:32:59] [Music]
[1:33:05] h
[1:33:48] maybe it's in this moment
[1:33:50] god wants to speak with you just get in
[1:33:52] control god wants to meet you there
[1:33:56] you're willing
[1:34:00] to be put aside
[1:34:16] lord

[1:34:23] if the great i am is with me
[1:34:26] then i will be able
