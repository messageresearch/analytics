may God bless you in this wonderful evening you may be seated Brothers I'd like to tell you something quickly before beginning well I Was preparing to come to service I saw myself in the mirror photos and I saw the picture that they took of me in the hospital and I was giving [Music] and when I see those pictures [Music] foreign he told me that America was for you and foreign God is good yeah I don't know if I was the instrument God please the music so he can glorify himself it could have been you but it was mean I give glory to God for that okay for you because it was me now [Music] [Music] well we're gonna strive may God help us verse 11. God's word reads Fuego con Caballo de Fuego dos is they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah were not by a whirlwind into heaven is the Prophet Elijah [Music] he was captured served Elijah six to ten years he learned he was prepared he was formed he learned many things he had to learn before being anointed many times we read and win things happen quickly but there's always to prepare his children and Elisha was serving Elijah foreign foreign foreign and those and he folds it into he smites the water yeah and the Jordan was divided he does an incredible Miracle violating or defying the laws of gravity he makes the waters parts and be suspended walk on dry ground and once they walk through God's word says there were children of the Prophet that we're watching from what was happening how a very surprising was made by God's hand glorious to the name of God Gloria the Lord of God we are instruments in God's hands so God can be glorified a man amen um the other side of Jordan the Bible says that Elijah told Elijah what do you want me to do for you God is asking us what do you want me to do for you what do you want me to do for you what else do you need Church to believe what else do we need do you need a miracle God is willing to make a miracle says ask God for strength amen amen ask God for healing ask God for that nevertheless it's God the Elijah Oh Glory foreign Blanco and that's where we miss the target sometimes and sadly that's why we don't receive many times as many times we ask but God knows our hearts he knows what's inside our hearts that it's not for his glory for people to give us a pat on the back that's not what God wants he was humble in his heart that is pride from that spirit says in First Peter 5 5. likewise simple and we will see God's glory hello Google that's why he was cast out from Heaven Ezekiel 28 17 says a reason of thy brightness and I will bring these to ashes upon them in the sight of them that behold God gives us the more humble we should be and I say this for God's glory or Pastor he's always helping and stretching us gives us an opportunity to preach the word he doesn't ask for a PhD he asked us so we can strive and I was thinking if I would be in a different place I would be sitting I would be without opportunities God bless you pastors thank you let's watch out for pride okay okay I'm gonna be closing now I like to read a quote from brother Brandon I was reading this message today and I enjoyed this says a cruelty of sin and the penalty that it costs to Rich Sin from our lives are you willing tonight to die unto yourself he's speaking about pride is are you willing to die out to all thoughts of yourself just slay on the rock with your lamb there is when I think of men and women who think of Pride young men and women will give their lives over two things no one is exempt here here everyone is included and Men of age thinking of their job and of their neighborhood or something like that oh why don't you cry tonight Yonder on the cross with him let's die to our pride let's die to our arrogance it draws us far from God and be humble with him desire him with all of our hearts of his presence of his grace not to be greater than um only to glorify God our Lord Jesus Christ a god of Miracles of salvation testimonial that our testimony sound and be taken to the people that need it that need to see a change glorious glory to the Lord let's take up Elisha's example he did not want the double portion to be greater so do his will regulations so glorify the name of the Lord and that's why God granted him because he saw humbleness because he saw sincerely we cannot deceive God but not God God bless you and thank you [Applause] God bless you Elizabeth if you just uh open your Bibles I just want to read uh one scripture once again uh it's Second Kings 2 uh verse 14. and uh we'll just uh we'll just start off with Brother John Redd I just want to read it once again and it says like this second Kings 214 it says and he took the mentor of Elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah is Edo donde El Dios de Elias and uh you know when uh I think it was brother Alex that said it when he preached Alex he said that our brother uh when he said that Elijah was in the cave Elias you know and he thought he was the only one left thought he was the only one that had uh that that believed that the gospel you know in in the god in the God that he serves you know and uh he I remember him saying that he was sad that he was depressed because you know he didn't have anything in anybody to uh to deposit what he had what he had in him amen and you know but you know that he heard that still Small Voice and uh you know and and he called him out of the cave you know he said there was seven thousand more yeah amen amen as you know and he begins his journey because when Elijah had to be deposited somewhere you see he he wasn't selfish as a matter of fact oh you know what what he had and uh what he had he it wasn't gonna do him no good when he where he was going amen amen he begins his journey and you know and he sees Elijah elishao and you know the the thing of it is I think what God I believe what God Elijah's attention was that Elisha was playing with the team of us and you know that's why we don't yoke up Believers with unbelievers amen and you go there I'll be because you know they're not in the same steps and you know God wants us to be in rhythmos he wants us to be in sync because you know sometimes you know what's holding you back and you know it's the person that you're hanging around they're not they're not with you oh you know you're pulling forward and they're dragging you back God doesn't want that he has no quieres but Elijah he sees the life and you know Elijah wasn't a poor man his man what he is his father was a man of world so he was he was actually about his father's business believe that's what God Elijah's eyes he's like I like this guy because he's got potential you see I believe he was looking for a man of the same caliber as him somebody that felt a burden somebody that knew what it was like to pull somebody that wasn't just gonna sit back and relax but he knew what it was like to go forward because you know he was about his father's business you know the the son of of a wealthy man you know he could have kick back relax he could have had somebody else do it [Music] oh my God that would just be somebody this is a good place for you but Elijah foreign foreign until you respond [Applause] and things take place because the two just comes together Mercury amen foreign forgot to park the waters that he would just open them up you would just reveal to us oh what it is that he wants us to do and he would just open that we would just open up our hearts what is exactly we're needing amen amen Eliseo sees Elijah Department we see a perfect type of Moses and Joshua Josue amen amen they said you know Moses opened the waters and then you know on the comeback you know we see Jordan we see Joshua open the waters he does the same things God vindicating you know that this was the man this was the man that that that was gonna leave the people okay amen amen so when we sit there and and you know have you ever went to I'm talking about deposit now all right and we are said we have a lot of the depository you know because that's what that's what Elisha was after all right he wanted he wanted you know that that deposit you know have you ever gone to the store and uh you know you think you got money in the bank you know and it's just it's just easy for you to just you know swipe together yo you got about four or five people behind you you know you should just swipe use declined it is it's kind of it's embarrassing yes pretty shameful man they think I'm broke another there was never a deposit they never [Music] that's the first thing he does foreign I want you to notice uh the first miracle that he does after opening the waters is that he goes to Jericho and he brings healing you know I believe we believe a message in this day okay it was the first pool Elijah goes to Jericho and he takes healing to the water amen amen there can't be any fruits have you ever drank bitter waters you know it [Music] I want you to understand what what he what he uses he uses Elisha uses salt Eliseo USA Sal to heal the waters amen amen you know salt is good the soul has influence amen amen Tierra we should have that influence you know wherever we are wherever we go oh we should have an influence and you know there's a lot of people oh they're not receptive you know perhaps to to your persona you know and the reason is because when you add salt to an open wound okay you know it brings the irritation it burns you know and I believe that you know when you bring that salt and you know you pour it on people that are wounded you said they will just let God let's just continue to work it would bring healing to the people you see it would bring healing to their lives and amen amen you see one of these things you know that that that that that that happened here was that Elisha you know making sure I said that that deposit okay was there estaba there was a confirmation from God that he was with Elijah and you know there was a lot of people Elijah in their time but they didn't see him exactly all the way Elijah song I believe that there's a lot of people in our time they won't exactly see brother Branham exactly the way you see him you see he was a true propheta he was a prophet of God authenticated by the word himself you see the thing of it is it have you caught that revelation for the last time that they didn't exactly see him they didn't see him to leave like Elisha Dido is and there's a lot of people oh they won't see they won't see this message oh exactly the way you see it because they couldn't accept the man but Jesus said if you don't believe me oh believe the works you see it and that's why they don't catch it foreign that's his desire tonight
