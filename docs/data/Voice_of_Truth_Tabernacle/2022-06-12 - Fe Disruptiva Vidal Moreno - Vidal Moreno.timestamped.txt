[32:11] you that ye should earnestly contend
[32:14] for the faith which was once delivered
[32:16] unto the saints
[32:26] ex

[33:45] lord jesus
[33:47] christ amen amen you may be seated
[33:50] sientos
[33:54] uh it's kind of been on my mind during
[33:56] the past uh
[33:57] past month
[34:01] uh i i want to title this message
[34:18] you know when we talk about something
[34:20] that uh that disrupts
[34:26] you know i i kind of want to i kind of
[34:28] want to um i want you to understand what
[34:30] what i'm speaking of when i say
[34:31] disrupted
[34:42] it indicates something you know
[34:44] something that that's ruptured and then
[34:45] something that's what you would call a a
[34:48] little grotesque or a rough indica
[34:54] uh you know
[34:55] and then uh on the other side
[34:58] you know it makes reference to a
[35:15] and i think that's what we want that's
[35:16] what we want yes
[35:19] so we don't come to the house of god
[35:22] you know to to have a small chain but
[35:26] you know what i don't i don't believe
[35:27] that you know
[35:28] i believe
[35:38] you know if i was just if i wasn't going
[35:40] to receive a whole lot
[35:42] you know i'd be going to do something
[35:44] that i i really like to do
[35:48] you know i'm actually doing something
[35:49] that i really like to do
[35:52] this is something i enjoy
[35:56] serving god
[36:10] amen
[36:52] foreign
[37:19] you know we talk about beast a lot of
[37:21] times we we think that it's a bad thing
[37:25] but but you know uh the beast can be it
[37:28] can be used on good terms
[37:33] he can be a beast
[37:45] [Music]
[38:03] jude one uh i believe it was three
[38:05] images
[38:08] you know i want to read that once again
[38:12] it says like this you say
[38:14] it's just beloved
[38:16] you see our mothers
[38:50] [Applause]
[39:12] is
[39:54] he's gonna get back up
[39:56] that he if he lost one battle
[39:59] that does not mean he lost the war
[40:03] the war is not defined
[40:07] one battle boruno
[40:20] he is
[40:50] he's the winner
[41:11] i just want to give some examples here
[41:15] you know whenever you are
[41:18] sleeping
[41:30] you know you're nice and you you know
[41:31] you just
[41:32] i don't know what what stage of sleep it
[41:35] is but it's there's one that's real good
[41:41] first thing there you go first stage
[41:43] third third stage
[41:44] is
[41:59] that that people don't that they don't
[42:00] like to
[42:26] they're gonna let you know
[43:07] you know when we come to the house of
[43:09] god
[43:24] know i think that's what god means to do
[43:27] yes look in your pencil case look at
[43:28] your skin i said oh my god he's not
[43:30] gonna sugarcoat things
[43:34] he's not he's not gonna just he's not
[43:36] gonna be like oh it's okay it's okay
[44:21] a man
[44:22] it's just something that's been
[44:23] disrupted
[44:26] you know and and i think that that's
[44:27] what he he doesn't do things by accident
[44:32] he does them on purpose
[44:34] and he allows
[44:48] you think god wants
[45:00] he was allowed to disrupt a lot of
[45:02] things
[45:44] the devil never
[47:22] what
[47:36] is
[48:22] it's not just
[48:24] i mean we could take it in so many ways
[48:29] and remember we don't want to lose focus
[48:30] on on the faith part of it
[48:55] it brings a lot of of complacency
[48:58] being complacent just
[49:00] you know like how would you call it
[49:03] when you're complacent you're you're
[49:04] just you're just satisfied
[49:10] satisfied with coming to church
[49:12] uh especially
[49:14] you know god's gotta he's gotta disrupt
[49:17] that
[49:19] no he's gotta he's gonna just you know
[49:21] get get a little rough sometimes
[49:25] yes that's right escorto you guys gotta
[49:27] get rough
[49:44] it helps i do that it does i see you
[49:47] know what it it helps when you when you
[49:49] correct
[49:52] because it gets their attention
[49:55] that's what god wants to do okay i said
[49:58] because you know in church what can like
[50:00] listen to
[50:01] the nemo
[50:02] the word
[50:04] for a moment
[50:08] and then we forgive you
[50:09] and it becomes a psychology
[51:20] this is
[52:16] what faith is look at la fetes what
[52:19] disruptive faith is
[52:22] contrary es lo contrario to what what
[52:25] the world thinks the local mundo
[52:27] piensata
[52:28] face fedex ruptiva
[52:43] does something different
[52:45] ferente amen amen
[52:48] and when we sit there and think about it
[52:53] this work esta caminata was supposed to
[52:56] produce some things
[53:00] it was supposed to it was supposed to do
[53:02] things
[53:04] that just come in the church mosque
[53:07] dressed in eyes
[53:12] putting on the jail
[53:20] you know it goes so much further
[53:23] other than that
[53:25] you know when we talk about it you see
[53:28] when you get this kind of faith
[53:31] you see because when nature is disrupted
[53:37] you know when nature is disrupted
[53:40] you know something happens to it
[53:44] you know it's like i said something's
[53:46] interrupted
[53:48] and it's not normal
[53:50] it's not normal
[53:51] to the point
[53:53] where people start noticing the last
[53:56] person
[53:57] but there was a there was a 7.2
[53:59] earthquake in peru i believe it was uh
[54:01] when we were in cedar hill at new mexico
