[19:50] to First Peter
[19:53] capitulo cuatro chapter four
[19:56] verse 12 to 13.
[20:00] and the word of the Lord says like this

[20:46] almost
[20:48] uh
[20:52] the topic they're the idea that I bring
[20:55] Brothers
[20:58] is times of trial
[21:01] s
[21:04] how many know that we are living in the
[21:06] difficult times Brothers
[21:09] we are living truly
[21:13] in times better
[21:16] that we were elected to live in
[21:22] and I believe that beforehand God knew
[21:25] bro amen that every one of us
[21:28] that are here man
[21:34] I believe that God
[21:36] has allowed us
[21:38] the best yes so that is his word
[21:42] Brothers amen
[21:45] because when you have the word Brothers
[21:47] amen
[21:49] foreign
[22:27] uh
[22:34] Gustavo I mean our brother gustavo's
[22:36] uncle
[22:37] is
[22:42] he was the president the youth president
[22:45] now was the vice
[22:52] I would say
[22:55] que dios that God
[22:58] amen
[23:09] pero
[23:11] transl
[23:15] the time came
[23:18] and I believe that I was at the highest
[23:22] I've learned the spiritual spiritually
[23:24] speaking
[23:26] I would say that I would never fall amen
[23:31] and I hope that this this evening that
[23:34] each and every one of us
[23:36] foreign
[23:59] amen amen
[24:06] but I was in the highest
[24:10] Brothers win
[24:12] amen
[24:28] let me tell you that is
[24:34] I spent a lot of time there
[24:38] foreign
[24:53] I remember that but
[25:00] I began to pray
[25:06] change Brothers
[25:12] time came that I had prayed so much
[25:18] says
[25:30] when you can take out the best of you
[25:33] and we see here Brothers
[25:39] and I remember it was a Sunday
[25:43] the service finished
[25:47] the Sunday service the Sunday School
[25:49] service okay
[25:53] and I remember that I stayed here
[25:58] I said Lord forgive me I know that I
[26:01] failed
[26:12] from here on out
[26:24] the face of an elderly woman
[26:29] she told me
[26:33] what do you need
[26:35] this
[26:37] and she told me like this she said
[26:41] because God has sent me she said
[26:46] God has heard your prayer he said yes
[26:50] God has forgiven you she said
[27:12] us being the way we are
[27:14] says amen
[27:27] sometimes I begin to think
[27:29] senior
[27:39] yeah
[27:42] orange and when he would get there to
[27:45] Orange he would preach
[27:47] and he would say these things Brothers
[27:50] you would speak about his children
[27:56] my children are here with me they
[27:59] accompany me this is
[28:02] amen
[28:06] because they need to live that
[28:09] experience
[28:10] that experience with God
[28:16] because meanwhile you don't see it is
[28:52] Elijah
[29:12] said
[29:20] he was righteous foreign
[29:57] that the same thing was going to happen
[29:59] to him
[30:01] he was scared Brothers
[30:26] to desperation
[30:29] amen
[30:35] Brothers
[30:37] [Music]
[30:42] the people of Israel
[30:50] when he went through the Red Sea amen
[30:53] amen
[30:55] we can see that
[30:59] imagine Brothers
[31:05] making a wall on each side
[31:09] and how it is that the people of of God
[31:12] they went through
[31:13] [Music]
[31:17] that even it was meant until the last
[31:19] one went through
[31:24] he was shut amen
[31:29] when the sea shut
[31:33] up if the Bible says
[31:38] or the song says
[31:46] it says that he closed it as well
[31:52] I can't imagine la
[32:02] and all the soldiers
[32:05] this uh
[32:09] how can we say when it comes
[32:14] and the Egyptians amen
[32:19] roses says that
[32:21] is
[32:41] a jubilee
[32:54] we see that it says that
[32:57] is
[32:59] that the people began to complain amen
[33:02] amen
[33:04] it is
[34:26] nature itself shows us
[34:29] foreign
[35:00] strongest
[35:10] he's not going to attack the strongest
[35:15] the one that's wounded
[35:19] animals
[35:28] and so then us Brothers
[35:31] if we allow ourselves
[35:58] as he was a couple days ago a year ago
[36:28] necessary that we see God amen amen
[36:38] Hermanos and we see Brothers
[36:41] there's a song that I really like
[36:50] when I feel weak
[36:53] ermanos and to see Brothers
[36:59] it says even even then I'm here even now
[37:03] I'm here not because I want to
[37:07] [Music]
[37:07] um
[37:24] when I hear it
[37:31] how many models have we not fought
[37:34] Brothers it says
[37:38] sometimes amen
[37:42] let me tell you
[37:45] that if you're a Son of God
[37:50] you seek the things of God let me tell
[37:54] you
[38:03] at one point brother Brandon asked the
[38:05] question and he said
[38:09] how many children of God are there amen
[38:14] children of God are in this place
[38:16] Brothers
[38:19] so then
[38:24] it's not because we're strong Brothers
[38:26] amen
[38:29] but if we do the will of God
[38:31] God will be with us
[38:34] it's not going to leave us
[38:43] that he started in us
[38:49] and if we were
[38:55] important not matter man Brothers
[39:12] God is going to help us keep going
[39:14] forward
[39:24] I'm going to leave the place to my
[39:27] brother for him to come forward bless
[39:30] you
[39:32] [Applause]
[39:35] thank you
[39:44] God bless our brother Victor
[39:50] um
[39:53] I enjoy when they share that they had
[39:55] struggles
[40:01] again
[40:07] it's grace and mercy that we're here man
[40:09] estamos
[40:11] um
[40:14] we're speaking on the Book of Judges
[40:20] and in Judges chapter 6 in versicolono
[40:24] and the first one we'll be reading
[40:28] is
[40:36] and the children of Israel did Evil and
[40:39] the sight of the Lord and the Lord
[40:40] delivered them into the hand of media in
[40:43] seven years
[40:48] the people of Israel
[40:51] um
[41:04] you told them to follow their word
[41:08] um
[41:11] and they did it for a certain time is
[41:20] but it came to the time
[41:22] the point came for the children of
[41:24] Israel where they forgot who their God
[41:26] was
[41:28] I forgot everything God had done for
[41:30] them
[41:32] and questions
[41:34] and judges also says that they never
[41:38] expelled the Canaanites God
[41:46] is
[41:51] and the people of Israel little by
[41:53] little prostituted themselves with the
[41:55] candidates
[41:58] establish themselves together
[42:02] they adopted their culture and religion
[42:08] there was a moral corruption
[42:11] ninos they sacrificed children
[42:15] and they worship idols
[42:18] basically Israel
[42:20] Israel Israel is is a Canaanite
[42:25] it was a time of Darkness
[42:32] and they turned like the Canaanites
[42:35] against God
[42:38] and When sin comes is
[42:43] when soon came they were oppressed and
[42:46] conquered by the Canaanites
[42:49] and eventually the Israelites noticed
[42:52] this is
[42:54] and they repented and cried to God
[43:00] so God heard the Cry of his people again
[43:07] delivery
[43:09] a judge
[43:11] amongst the people of Israel
[43:14] that will defeat the Canaanites
[43:22] there was peace for a while
[43:26] but the people of Israel sinned again
[43:31] so basically it was uh
[43:33] and another side
[43:36] and God will hear the Cry of his people
[43:39] and he would raise
[43:49] but then they left God's way again
[43:54] Israel's condition was horrible
[43:59] God would raise men and women
[44:04] but again the people of Israel would
[44:06] forget
[44:09] they forgot the god of their fathers
[44:14] that's what was the problem brothers
[44:19] because they never made the god of their
[44:21] fathers their God yes
[44:26] they began to speak like this
[44:29] is
[44:35] they
[44:39] were people of Israel
[44:41] but at their own way
[44:45] yeah see
[44:46] and that is
[44:50] in this age
[44:54] they we live or they live how they work
[45:00] lukewarm
[45:02] they do whatever they want they do it
[45:07] and not in God's way
[45:13] we even do Church our own way
[45:41] in need
[45:47] and there we cried cigar
[45:57] as in this time
[46:03] Studios they have forgotten their God
[46:11] I had to preach two Fridays ago
[46:16] and last Friday
[46:18] but I got sick
[46:26] more time for myself to be in my illness
[46:31] you've got to put something in my heart
[46:35] hey
[46:37] comments next time and I began to
[46:40] examine myself
[46:44] I began to analyze my life
[46:47] Cristiana and I said how is my Christian
[46:50] Life
[46:52] I'm not only speaking I'm going to
[46:54] church I'm not only speaking
[46:58] three times a week
[47:06] um
[47:10] Leader song leading here
[47:13] or preaching here yesterday
[47:24] it happened with the people of Israel
[47:27] they left God
[47:32] play with the world
[47:37] so how we were sometimes used
[47:41] we lift up idols
[47:43] Bernie samosas we prioritize other
[47:47] things
[47:48] I speak for myself
[47:52] I'm no one to judge
[47:56] good
[48:02] says the judges
[48:09] they were elected
[48:12] they stood up for God
[48:27] the angel
[48:30] s
[48:31] but he had to fix things
[48:42] had to remove it
[48:55] God could help them
[49:08] that's how maybe our lives could be
[49:10] today
[49:14] our relationship with God Is Not the
[49:16] Same
[49:18] [Music]
[49:22] okay
[49:28] why don't you stand off regardless
[49:37] bothering you in your life
[49:43] and I enjoy them too much
[49:47] prioritize that more than God
[49:50] soccer for me
[50:04] priority to Jesus
[50:07] [Music]

[1:00:41] but now the Lord has forsaken
[1:00:46] and delivered us into the hands of the
[1:00:49] midianites
[1:00:51] and the Lord looked upon him and said
[1:00:55] go in this time
[1:00:59] and thou shalt save Israel from the

[1:05:50] from the midianites

[1:51:00] logically
[1:51:03] Satan Compton gives us so many reasons

[1:51:13] there's something deep in our hearts

[1:51:58] [Music]
[1:52:30] the other day
[1:52:34] the first time I gave my heart to the

[1:53:10] difficult
