[1:12:01] come and like in Uganda when a king says
[1:12:07] something it becomes a
[1:12:10] command and because my father is a
[1:12:13] father to the

[1:12:22] something it's better you

[1:20:58] more we are on hallelu
[1:21:02] Boulevard and so we want to put a title
[1:21:05] to this
[1:21:07] message the Temple of the
[1:21:11] Dynamics we're here to dedicate a temple
[1:21:15] right but the greatest Temple is the
[1:21:17] Temple of the
[1:21:21] Dynamics for
[1:21:25] speech
[1:21:28] spee
[1:21:51] speech
[1:21:55] amen amen so the Temple of the
[1:21:59] Dynamics am I talking to anyone
[1:22:04] here
[1:22:07] no well you all act like you're afraid
[1:22:10] like it's your first day in
[1:22:14] church did we come to have a good
[1:22:18] time all right well maybe maybe you
[1:22:21] don't like your neighbor to
[1:22:24] much maybe you got to turn around and
[1:22:26] shake your neighbor's
[1:22:28] hand neighbor good to see
[1:22:31] you okay maybe you need to stretch a
[1:22:34] little
[1:22:37] bit let me tell you
[1:22:39] something when Solomon was dedicating
[1:22:42] the
[1:22:44] temple uhuh nuh we got a couple that are
[1:22:49] happy said all the congregation
[1:22:54] all the
[1:22:56] musicians all worship together as one
[1:23:00] man so I want to make sure that you're
[1:23:03] ready for
[1:23:06] dedication so how many are
[1:23:08] happy how many are the Temple of the
[1:23:12] Dynamics it seems like we have a bunch
[1:23:15] of temples of the
[1:23:18] mechanics but it's time that we bring in
[1:23:21] the Dynamics
[1:23:23] because we are the temple brother Bram
[1:23:25] says of the
[1:23:29] Dynamics 1 Chronicles if you can be so
[1:23:32] kind 1 Chronicles 29
[1:23:37] 1-3 we'll probably just read uh one and
[1:23:42] two when you have it you can say
[1:23:48] amen God bless those that are on
[1:23:51] hookup
[1:23:53] God bless all the ministry that is
[1:23:56] here certainly good to see each one of
[1:24:01] you furthermore David the king said unto
[1:24:04] all the congregation Solomon my son whom
[1:24:08] alone God hath chosen is yet young and
[1:24:11] tender and the work is great for the
[1:24:15] palace is not for man but for the Lord
[1:24:21] God
[1:24:32] now I have prepared with all my might
[1:24:35] for the house of God of my God the gold
[1:24:38] for things to be made of gold and the
[1:24:41] silver for things of silver the brass
[1:24:44] for things of brass the iron for things
[1:24:46] of iron and wood for things of wood onx
[1:24:49] stones and stones to be set glister ing
[1:24:52] stones and of diverse colors and all
[1:24:54] manner of precious stones and marble
[1:24:57] stones in
[1:25:21] abundance AB may God add His blessings
[1:25:24] to the reading of his word you may be
[1:25:29] seated what a desire that David
[1:25:33] had I remember when we first went to Los
[1:25:38] Cruses it was the thing that was that
[1:25:41] weighed so heavy upon
[1:25:45] me that we would have a place of
[1:25:49] worship now I remember the joys when we
[1:25:51] were able able to build the
[1:25:55] church finally have our own
[1:25:59] place my the joy as brother Titus was
[1:26:02] telling
[1:26:04] me I could I could hear the hear the joy
[1:26:08] in his
[1:26:11] voice but I I could feel it more than
[1:26:14] just hear
[1:26:16] it and so the desire that David had for
[1:26:20] the Ark of the Lord
[1:26:24] the desire to build a
[1:26:27] temple as we go back and just for a few
[1:26:29] moments I just want to I want to talk
[1:26:31] just a little bit about that
[1:26:35] Temple we know that David was not
[1:26:37] permitted to build
[1:26:40] it because of all the blood that was
[1:26:43] shed during his
[1:26:47] lifetime but as the Lord told him your
[1:26:49] son would would build the temple
[1:26:54] and and through the process of all
[1:26:57] this you know there was a woman that
[1:26:59] heard a about uh this this great man
[1:27:02] this great king named
[1:27:06] Solomon everybody knows she was uh Queen
[1:27:09] the Queen of Sheba
[1:27:12] right and she brought a a lot of
[1:27:16] gold you know sometimes we think about
[1:27:19] the queen that she brought just a little
[1:27:21] bag of gold said here you go Solomon
[1:27:23] good
[1:27:27] job no no the Bible says it was a very
[1:27:30] great
[1:27:34] train very much
[1:27:37] gold and precious
[1:27:40] stones the Bible tells us that it was
[1:27:43] about 120
[1:27:46] talents which if you figure it out in
[1:27:49] today's
[1:27:51] worth
[1:27:55] she only brought him about $225 Million
[1:27:58] worth of
[1:28:02] gold tell your neighbor neighbor
[1:28:05] 225
[1:28:08] million that's a lot that's a lot
[1:28:12] 2 and so David had assembled a lot of
[1:28:16] gold and
[1:28:20] silver the Bible says that it was a
[1:28:22] 100,000 talents of
[1:28:28] gold that was going to be put into the
[1:28:31] into the
[1:28:33] temple would equal
[1:28:36] about 200 billion dollar worth of
[1:28:43] gold and a million talents of
[1:28:48] silver which is almost around 23 billion
[1:28:52] billion
[1:28:54] dollar and all together there was this
[1:28:57] is not including anything else just the
[1:28:59] gold and the
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:03] silver it would have been almost around
[1:29:07] 225 billion dollars worth of silver and
[1:29:14] gold they said they they estimate King
[1:29:18] Solomon's value or his worth today his
[1:29:20] net worth
[1:29:26] would be about $2.1
[1:29:31] trillion you talk about being
[1:29:35] blessed it was a wonderful time for
[1:29:40] Israel and yet brother Brandon preaches
[1:29:42] the message a greater than Solomon is
[1:29:45] [Music]
[1:29:48] here I think that that's many times
[1:29:50] where where we have a disconnect
[1:29:55] I don't think we understand really
[1:29:57] really what our value what our worth
[1:30:01] is and because we don't understand
[1:30:05] that we we just go along with the
[1:30:08] flow brother Braham says we live a
[1:30:11] million miles under our god-given
[1:30:17] privileges years later as we know the
[1:30:20] the temple was thrown down
[1:30:25] children of Israel taken into
[1:30:29] captivity but when they returned to
[1:30:32] build the
[1:30:34] temple and it was
[1:30:37] finished let's see what
[1:30:40] happened Hagi the second chapter if you
[1:30:43] can turn to
[1:30:48] it I pray my my voice will hold up to
[1:30:51] today
[1:31:05] okay and and let's just read verse three
[1:31:08] to save some time
[1:31:15] here they gathered the people together
[1:31:18] and he asked them a
[1:31:20] question
[1:31:23] who was left among you that saw the
[1:31:26] house in her first
[1:31:32] Glory what a question
[1:31:34] huh is there anybody here he
[1:31:37] says that saw this house in its first
[1:31:43] Glory how do you see it
[1:31:47] now they had finished this Temple and it
[1:31:50] was called now zarab Babel's Temple
[1:31:54] Temple and he says is it not in your
[1:31:56] eyes in comparison of it as
[1:32:01] nothing after seeing all the gold and
[1:32:03] the silver that was put into the first
[1:32:08] temple how do you compare this next one
[1:32:11] with that first
[1:32:14] one and then after saying
[1:32:17] that hagy gives a seems like an unusual
[1:32:21] ual
[1:32:26] prophecy this is verse
[1:32:28] n it says the glory of this latter house
[1:32:35] glor shall be greater than of the
[1:32:41] former sayith the Lord of
[1:32:43] hosts and in this place will I give
[1:32:47] peace sayth the Lord of
[1:32:50] hosts as the temple was being
[1:32:54] rebuilt there was a group of Jews there
[1:32:57] in
[1:32:59] Jerusalem who were actually a little bit
[1:33:04] disappointed these older Jews who could
[1:33:06] recall the grandure of the first
[1:33:13] temple they regarded Zer Babel's Temple
[1:33:16] as a poor substitute of the
[1:33:20] original
[1:33:25] and in their minds it did not compare at
[1:33:28] all with Solomon's
[1:33:33] Temple it was true that zabel's Temple
[1:33:36] was built on a smaller
[1:33:42] scale with much fewer
[1:33:46] resources than Solomon's Temple had
[1:33:49] been and also Solomon's Temple had
[1:33:52] housed the Ark of the
[1:33:58] Covenant it had they had witnessed Fire
[1:34:02] come down from
[1:34:05] heaven it had been filled with a Shina
[1:34:09] glory and still hegi
[1:34:13] prophesied that this second
[1:34:16] temple would one day have a
[1:34:20] magnificence
[1:34:24] and it would outshine Solomon's
[1:34:30] Temple we're we're getting
[1:34:33] somewhere he says one when this one one
[1:34:36] of these
[1:34:37] days it's going to outshine the other
[1:34:42] Temple I know you saw the gold and you
[1:34:44] saw the
[1:34:46] silver but there's something going to
[1:34:50] happen that that will make Solomon's
[1:34:55] Temple seem a little
[1:34:59] dull his words were fulfilled 500 years
[1:35:06] later when something
[1:35:10] happened that did not happen in the
[1:35:12] first
[1:35:14] temple he said the glory of the
[1:35:19] latter would be greater than the glory
[1:35:21] of the
[1:35:24] former 500 years
[1:35:27] later the Messiah Jesus
[1:35:32] Christ comes walking through the temple
[1:35:35] of
[1:35:37] zerbel it was no longer the walls that
[1:35:40] was the that was the
[1:35:43] attraction come on church I'm going to
[1:35:45] say it again it was no longer the gold
[1:35:48] and the silver that was the attraction
[1:35:52] but now God
[1:35:55] Almighty in the beginning was the
[1:36:00] word the word was with God and the Word
[1:36:04] was God and the word became
[1:36:07] flesh and dwelt amongst
[1:36:10] us and the body of that
[1:36:13] word came and walked right through the
[1:36:18] temple okay so now we're getting
[1:36:20] somewhere
[1:36:22] you see the first temple and the second
[1:36:25] temple as great as they
[1:36:28] were was not the great
[1:36:32] mystery it was not the great mystery
[1:36:34] that God had in the back part of his
[1:36:40] mind this is where many people fail
[1:36:43] today they look at the message and they
[1:36:46] said wow what a great
[1:36:49] message and they're always looking
[1:36:52] back as what God did back
[1:36:55] then or they're always looking
[1:36:58] forward to what God is going to do but
[1:37:02] very few
[1:37:03] realize and see what he's doing right
[1:37:08] now I'm going to tell you right now the
[1:37:12] glory of what's in this
[1:37:15] building is even
[1:37:18] greater than Solomon or zarab Babel's
[1:37:20] Temple
[1:37:23] oh come on do you believe that or not
[1:37:26] let me see your hands if you believe
[1:37:28] it there's more Glory going on right
[1:37:33] now than there ever has
[1:37:36] been in the history of of
[1:37:40] mankind because now the
[1:37:43] bride what had been
[1:37:46] promised people staying on that now
[1:37:48] listen to this this is where the people
[1:37:51] go where people will
[1:37:54] go they read the
[1:37:57] message and it's
[1:37:59] tremendous but there's a
[1:38:02] point brother Bram says where the
[1:38:07] attraction goes from the
[1:38:12] prophet oh come on now I'm going to say
[1:38:15] it again there's a
[1:38:17] point at which the
[1:38:20] attraction go from the
[1:38:22] prophet to his prophecy
[1:38:30] now I'm going to say it again there's a
[1:38:34] point at which the
[1:38:36] attraction goes from the
[1:38:39] prophet to his
[1:38:41] prophecy in other words what I'm trying
[1:38:43] to tell
[1:38:44] you is that every prophecy has to have a
[1:38:50] face
[1:38:54] the devil don't care how much message
[1:38:57] you
[1:38:58] know he don't care how much scripture
[1:39:01] you
[1:39:03] know but you know what he
[1:39:06] cares he
[1:39:08] trembles when the scriptures has a
[1:39:12] [Applause]
[1:39:15] face I'm going to say it again he
[1:39:19] trembles when the scriptures get a
[1:39:23] face he
[1:39:25] trembles when
[1:39:27] prophecy has a
[1:39:29] face now my question to you is
[1:39:33] this what are you the face
[1:39:38] of oh come on now I'm going to ask you
[1:39:41] again what are you the face
[1:39:47] of uh oh I can I can say God bless you
[1:39:50] and leave the pl right
[1:39:52] now and you all go
[1:39:55] home
[1:39:57] wow right you want to paint yourself up
[1:39:59] real
[1:40:00] nice well maybe you're the face of Max
[1:40:05] Factor
[1:40:07] maxor uh oh they didn't like that one
[1:40:10] huh wrong
[1:40:12] exit come on now what are you the face
[1:40:15] of I'm coming to something here
[1:40:19] now this is so tremendous
[1:40:22] mendous when we see the
[1:40:25] first God wanted to reveal
[1:40:29] himself he couldn't do it as all great
[1:40:34] the Elohim the great Jehovah
[1:40:38] God who covered all Space and
[1:40:41] Time and
[1:40:43] Eternity he could
[1:40:45] not he was too
[1:40:49] great to reveal himself to the
[1:40:53] people it was too
[1:40:57] mysterious and so what does he
[1:41:00] do he realizes he needs a
[1:41:07] face oh come on say it again he realizes
[1:41:11] he needs a
[1:41:19] face
[1:41:21] so then if he needed a
[1:41:23] face he needed a
[1:41:28] body First Corinthians chapter 6 verse
[1:41:32] 19 and
[1:41:37] 20
[1:41:39] what he needs a face
[1:41:42] what he needs a body
[1:41:45] what what a question what know ye not

[1:41:51] your
[1:42:00] body this is where we get this is where
[1:42:03] we get caught

[1:42:14] present can't
[1:42:16] overcome this is no good for

[1:47:06] Foundation brother Titus says we're not
[1:47:08] in a hurry
[1:47:14] today
[1:47:17] so in the beginning God created the
[1:47:19] Heaven and the
[1:47:23] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[1:47:27] void and
[1:47:28] darkness was upon the face of the
[1:47:38] deep you couldn't tell the face it was
[1:47:41] it was not what is it looks kind of
[1:47:44] through a glass
[1:47:49] Darkly and the spirit of God then moved
[1:47:52] upon the face of the
[1:47:57] waters now once again the spirit of God
[1:48:02] today is moving upon the face of the
[1:48:04] waters or of the
[1:48:10] people because Darkness has covered the
[1:48:12] Earth
[1:48:14] and gross Darkness has covered the
[1:48:18] people but God needs a a face
[1:48:29] today God needs a
[1:48:33] face he needs
[1:48:37] hands come on
[1:48:42] nowbody up there have any hands he needs
[1:48:46] hands he needs feet he needs eyes

[1:49:26] fruit and the only hands he has tonight
[1:49:30] is our
[1:49:34] hands the only eyes he has is is our
[1:49:40] eyes and here's he's here in the form of
[1:49:44] the pillar of
[1:49:47] fire the resurrected Christ
[1:49:52] now to be the face of

[1:57:19] my
[1:57:20] church and the Gates of Hell cannot

[1:57:24] against why because the
[1:57:28] Revelation has a face
[1:57:32] now I'm going to say it again the
[1:57:34] Revelation has a
[1:57:36] face and that's what Satan
[1:57:41] fears read the
[1:57:44] scriptures yeah search
[1:57:46] them in them you think you have eternal
[1:57:49] etal
[1:57:51] life but they are they that testify of
[1:57:55] me what is it because the
[1:57:58] scriptures are waiting for a
[1:58:01] face oh we're going to get to something
[1:58:04] good
[1:58:07] here it's time to become the
[1:58:12] face of who and what we are
[1:58:17] representing I have a niece that's going
[1:58:19] to college there in in
[1:58:23] Arizona she said
[1:58:25] Uncle I walk in there with my dress my
[1:58:30] skirt she says and I dare
[1:58:34] them to ask me why I wear skirts and
[1:58:42] dresses oh come
[1:58:44] on we have it so hard because we got to
[1:58:47] wear dress and skirts
[1:58:51] she said Uncle I dare them to ask
[1:58:55] me all I could do was just
[1:59:00] go that's all I
[1:59:02] need not embarrassed because she knows
[1:59:06] she's the face of
[1:59:09] something she is the face of a
[1:59:13] lady you don't find very many ladies
[1:59:17] anymore who's the face of of a
[1:59:21] lady who's the face of modesty
[1:59:31] anymore oh I wanted that to settle
[1:59:33] really
[1:59:35] good God would walk and talk with Adam
[1:59:41] every single
[1:59:45] day finally an Express son
[1:59:50] that God could talk face to
[1:59:54] face you see the attributes that were in
[1:59:57] him he couldn't have
[2:00:00] Fellowship until they were
[2:00:04] manifested then he could talk face to
[2:00:07] face watch
[2:00:10] now Adam was the face of a Son of
[2:00:15] God Son of God
[2:00:18] Adam
[2:00:20] but he also was the
[2:00:22] face of God of this
[2:00:29] earth oh come on now you know what
[2:00:33] happened that face was
[2:00:36] lost but he was the
[2:00:39] face of the God of this
[2:00:42] Earth imagine that how you doing
[2:00:46] father oh we're doing wonderful today
[2:00:48] was a wonderful
[2:00:50] day when the fall
[2:00:53] happened the veil was taken
[2:00:57] away and the face of Adam
[2:01:00] changed and it was no longer someone in
[2:01:05] control it was no longer someone with
[2:01:09] Dominion no it was now a fallen Son of
[2:01:15] God his whole complex his whole his
[2:01:18] whole look
[2:01:21] changed and I can see God looking at
[2:01:25] him that's not the face of my
[2:01:29] son that's not the face of the God of
[2:01:32] this
[2:01:33] Earth and that's why he says
[2:01:36] Adam Adam where are you you're lost in
[2:01:40] the
[2:01:41] darkness and the spirit of God moved
[2:01:44] upon the face of the
[2:01:47] deep chur that's what we need
[2:01:50] today is for the spirit of God to move
[2:01:53] upon the face of the
[2:01:56] waters we need faces to be
[2:02:01] restored representatives to be
[2:02:05] restored it's time we stop playing
[2:02:10] church and think it's okay because we
[2:02:12] jumped and
[2:02:14] shouted you can jump and shout and still
[2:02:17] have the same face
[2:02:20] but one time that you step into the holy
[2:02:24] of
[2:02:26] holies and he comes into the
[2:02:28] soul and he changes your
[2:02:31] heart your face
[2:02:33] [Music]
[2:02:35] changes brother brandham
[2:02:38] says you can tell you can
[2:02:41] tell when the when the presence of the
[2:02:44] Lord is moving around the
[2:02:47] building said can tell when it comes
[2:02:49] upon
[2:02:52] someone he says because their face
[2:02:55] changes something
[2:02:57] different oh I I see faces changing
[2:03:03] already oh that's look the sister right
[2:03:05] there the Lord's touching her right
[2:03:08] now what what do we come for just to
[2:03:11] hear a good
[2:03:12] message no we came so that we could
[2:03:15] become the
[2:03:17] face that's what this generation
[2:03:21] needs he needs some young
[2:03:24] people that'll stand up and say I will
[2:03:28] be the
[2:03:30] face to my
[2:03:32] generation you're the only
[2:03:35] way they'll ever know who God

[3:18:11] huh
[3:18:12] this event that is happening and has
[3:18:16] happened I want you to always
[3:18:20] remember it is not just a natural
[3:18:25] event it is a supernatural
[3:18:30] event and it's not just a supernatural
[3:18:34] event it is a preder natural
[3:18:37] event prer
[3:18:41] natural
[3:18:42] is that
[3:18:44] right somebody help me you somebody help
[3:18:47] him prer
[3:18:48] natural people don't know what prer
[3:18:50] natural is
[3:18:52] H I got you
[3:18:56] today this is a natural event first of
[3:19:00] all meaning that it is occurring in the
[3:19:04] natural in the Physical
[3:19:07] Realm and can be witnessed by our
[3:19:09] natural
[3:19:11] senses
[3:19:13] but it's also a supernatural
[3:19:16] event meaning there is no
[3:19:20] way that man could have ever
[3:19:23] orchestrated
[3:19:26] this all the events that
[3:19:29] happened for this event to take
[3:19:33] place this is the
[3:19:36] product of the physical and the
[3:19:40] spiritual the then the Earth Earthly and
[3:19:42] the
[3:19:44] Heavenly uniting together to make it a
[3:19:48] supernatural
[3:19:51] event but it's also a preternatural
[3:19:56] event meaning that it was marked
[3:20:00] out and
[3:20:02] determined
[3:20:04] beforehand before the before the
[3:20:06] foundation of the world was
[3:20:08] ever now you know preter natural
[3:20:13] I want to say this and I'm going to read
[3:20:15] this from brother
[3:20:18] brandham and I'm goingon to ask if
[3:20:20] brother Titus and and all the ones from
[3:20:24] from uh members here at Voice of Truth
[3:20:26] Tabernacle if you would stand to
[3:20:34] your I am so very proud
[3:20:38] of of this brothers and sisters
[3:20:40] here
[3:20:43] I'm going to say it again I'm so
[3:20:47] very but I want to tell you this as I
[3:20:50] read
[3:20:52] this love one
[3:20:57] another everybody understand love one
[3:21:01] another no matter what the devil tries
[3:21:03] to
[3:21:05] say now you're all one great big sweet
[3:21:09] group
[3:21:10] now
[3:21:12] everybody want to look around at them
[3:21:14] one great sweet
[3:21:33] group and then brother brandham
[3:21:36] says but remember my
[3:21:40] warning say won't let that stay that
[3:21:46] way everybody you got
[3:21:48] it you're a sweet
[3:21:51] group but Satan won't let it stay that
[3:21:54] way he'll shoot
[3:21:59] everything if he has to bring in
[3:22:02] someone to make his
[3:22:05] Target he'll bring some
[3:22:08] critic some
[3:22:10] unbeliever he'll sit him
[3:22:13] down cause him to fellowship with you
[3:22:15] under
[3:22:18] quietness and then he'll shoot that guy
[3:22:21] with some kind of
[3:22:24] poison and he'll start through the
[3:22:26] church with
[3:22:28] it don't you take sides with
[3:22:32] it don't you have nothing to do with
[3:22:35] anything
[3:22:36] else you stay right there loving one
[3:22:40] another
[3:22:42] but pray for that
[3:22:44] man that he'll be saved
[3:22:47] too or that woman whoever it
[3:22:50] is and stick one with
[3:22:54] another and stay with your
[3:23:04] pastor ouch
[3:23:09] ouch we are the face of the message
[3:23:11] remember
[3:23:13] remember stay with your
[3:23:16] pastor he's the
[3:23:19] shepherd and give him
[3:23:23] respects he'll lead you
[3:23:26] through because he's ordained of God to
[3:23:28] do
[3:23:30] so do you remember
[3:23:33] that the enemy will
[3:23:35] come and when he
[3:23:37] does just cling that much closer
[3:23:40] together
[3:23:43] and the ones that the devil's using for
[3:23:46] an
[3:23:48] enemy he'll either get
[3:23:51] out or become one of
[3:23:54] you stay
[3:23:57] together that's one thing that my father
[3:23:59] always told
[3:24:01] us no matter what happens stay
[3:24:05] together you ain't going to make it by
[3:24:08] yourself Stay Together
[3:24:12] as you remain standing I want to just
[3:24:14] read the scripture here in Acts
[3:24:17] [Music]
[3:24:20] 7:44 I'm sorry let's go to verse
[3:24:26] 47 but Solomon built him in
[3:24:30] house how be it the most high dwelleth
[3:24:33] not in temples made with hands as saith
[3:24:36] the
[3:24:40] prophet
[3:24:42] Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot
[3:24:48] stol what house will ye build me sayeth
[3:24:51] the
[3:24:54] Lord what is the place of my
[3:24:58] rest hath not my hand made all these
[3:25:04] things Hebrews
[3:25:07] 105 says wherefore when he cometh into
[3:25:10] the world he saith sacrifice and
[3:25:13] offerings thou wouldest not but a body
[3:25:17] hast thou prepared me which verse was
[3:25:20] that
[3:25:31] 10 I believe brother Titus is a man of
[3:25:35] vision and along with the people here
[3:25:37] have received this building this gift
[3:25:40] from the Lord
[3:25:44] so that the people can have a place out
[3:25:46] to get out of the rain and the
[3:25:50] snow where they can Worship the
[3:25:53] Lord this is a City of
[3:25:56] Refuge a lighthous in a dark
[3:26:00] world for the dying can run
[3:26:04] to and the only way to stay
[3:26:09] successful is to stay with the word
[3:26:13] stay in line with the
[3:26:14] word and although David was not able to
[3:26:17] build the
[3:26:19] temple he gathered all the
[3:26:22] materials that would be needed in order
[3:26:24] for his son Solomon to construct the
[3:26:28] temple and Solomon never varied one
[3:26:34] bit from the pattern of the temple that
[3:26:37] Moses saw in
[3:26:40] heaven what a spiritual application he
[3:26:45] says that we never leave the
[3:26:49] scriptures stay with the
[3:26:52] pattern that's the reason I
[3:26:55] believe the first church was patterned
[3:26:58] after
[3:27:00] it the next one
[3:27:02] patterned and everyone will be pattern
[3:27:05] the same
[3:27:07] way that's where the spiritual Builders
[3:27:10] today
[3:27:13] that's why the bride building of
[3:27:17] Christ is not ready for the
[3:27:21] bridegroom because the builders rejected
[3:27:23] the
[3:27:26] Cornerstone the Chief Cornerstone that
[3:27:28] was laid on the day of
[3:27:31] Pentecost which is the baptism of this
[3:27:33] holy
[3:27:36] spirit that is the real church
[3:27:38] now not of mortar not of brick
[3:27:43] or stone which
[3:27:45] perisheth but the real church is built
[3:27:48] upon the revelation of the
[3:27:52] word and the will of
[3:27:54] God a great day the day of dedication
[3:27:58] has arrived brother
[3:28:01] tius when they were come to dedicate the
[3:28:05] building the worshippers
[3:28:09] worshiped the building would have been a
[3:28:12] building in
[3:28:15] vain had it not been for the worshippers
[3:28:17] that came into the
[3:28:20] building but the building is now ready
[3:28:23] for
[3:28:26] dedication so now I as we bow our
[3:28:30] heads what a beautiful thing when he
[3:28:33] says the bo but a body hast thou
[3:28:37] prepared showing that God was going to
[3:28:39] dwell in a body
[3:28:43] and when this
[3:28:44] body his body of 2,000 years
[3:28:48] ago had been made a
[3:28:51] sacrifice the correct lamb had been
[3:28:56] sacrificed there was coming forth
[3:29:00] then God came to his own
[3:29:05] body which was his
[3:29:08] bride now my sincere prayer
[3:29:12] is that every
[3:29:14] worshiper will dedicate their own
[3:29:18] Temple to Worship in this
[3:29:21] Temple that's being dedicated
[3:29:24] today as we bow our
[3:29:26] heads we raise up brother
[3:29:29] Titus his wife his
[3:29:32] family and the church our heavenly
[3:29:36] father we are most
[3:29:38] humbly and sincerely assem assembled

[3:30:57] them till they just can't stay away
[3:30:59] apart from each
[3:31:02] other that they can feel fulfill the
[3:31:05] scriptures
[3:31:07] Lord that said I was glad when they said
[3:31:09] unto me let us go into the house of the
[3:31:13] Lord may they be so salty as you said

[3:31:20] earth May their lives be so rich and

[3:53:55] us amen amen just want to uh greet you
[3:54:01] today I'm not good at greeting when I'm
[3:54:06] preaching part of the training I
[3:54:09] received from my
[3:54:13] father even though he was good at
[3:54:18] greetings but he would he would always
[3:54:20] kind of get
[3:54:23] upset and he would invite somebody to
[3:54:26] preach and they would spend a lot of
[3:54:28] time greeting him and thanking
[3:54:35] him and on the way home he would kind of
[3:54:37] grumble
[3:54:41] I didn't invite that guy to come to
[3:54:43] greet
[3:54:46] me invited him to preach the
[3:54:50] word get up there and preach the
[3:54:54] word but uh but he would go places he
[3:54:57] would greet
[3:54:59] people so I don't
[3:55:02] know I I think the I think the
[3:55:06] grumblings spoke louder to me even what
[3:55:09] he
[3:55:11] did but um so I um want to greet you in
[3:55:16] the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:55:19] Christ and I want to extend greetings

[3:58:37] afternoon
[3:58:40] pleasure for me to greet you in the name
[3:58:41] of the Lord Jesus
[3:58:45] Christ one of the greatest privileges
[3:58:47] I've had in my
[3:58:50] life to be able to be in in the feast
[3:58:53] this this
[3:58:57] morning where God has manifested
[3:59:01] himself and he he himself came down
[3:59:06] directly to inaugurate and then give you
[3:59:08] this
[3:59:12] place God has dwelt in in this
[3:59:15] [Music]
[3:59:19] place everybody has privileges but the
[3:59:21] children of God are the privileged
[3:59:27] ones I thank brother Tito for allowing
[3:59:29] me to stand in his
[3:59:33] place Most Holy place on
[3:59:37] Earth not only the mountains
[3:59:40] around but it's a
[3:59:44] Pulpit because from there proceeds the
[3:59:46] word of
[3:59:49] life so we're sitting in Heavenly
[3:59:52] places and we're sharing in the
[3:59:57] joy and thinking how God wise how wise
[4:00:00] God
[4:00:02] is the the
[4:00:04] elders are for the
[4:00:07] edification
[4:00:09] of the following
[4:00:13] Generations he said how many Elders were
[4:00:15] in this
[4:00:16] place made for
[4:00:32] you this is in the Bible and he hasn't
[4:00:34] even realized
[4:00:37] it
[4:00:45] I have 50 years in the
[4:00:52] message I have low miles a lot of
[4:00:57] miles so I have to be going slow around
[4:01:00] the
[4:01:06] curves my wife accompanies me
[4:01:10] my my son-in-law as well and my
[4:01:14] daughter and my
[4:01:18] granddaughter we are accompanying you in
[4:01:20] this beautiful
[4:01:28] Feast because in a feast where there's
[4:01:30] no there's no drunks and there's no
[4:01:33] [Applause]
[4:01:37] shouting
[4:01:38] and in the day of Pentecost there was a
[4:01:40] great a a great uh party in where there
[4:01:43] was a lot of
[4:01:45] drunks and it it went up unto all the
[4:01:49] nations here
[4:01:51] also and is the same
[4:01:55] standard this torch that God has
[4:01:57] inaugurated
[4:02:01] today illuminate all this
[4:02:05] region to find that predestinated seed
[4:02:11] still does not know of this Marvelous
[4:02:14] Light this light that has dressed the
[4:02:20] bride there has not been a greater light
[4:02:22] not even the the light of the
[4:02:24] sun has the light that the bride
[4:02:28] has because the the sun will
[4:02:32] end and the bride will live
[4:02:37] eternally
[4:02:39] so for me it it it is a
[4:02:41] joy to be able to be with
[4:02:44] you I'm here in
[4:02:46] America for seven
[4:02:48] months I I left my my my
[4:02:53] church I left
[4:02:55] her because I am not
[4:02:58] dead and when a when a widow gets
[4:03:01] married they they she loses the
[4:03:04] husband but the one that doesn't get
[4:03:07] married ET she has a husband until
[4:03:18] eternity so I'm under a certain
[4:03:20] treatment that the doctors from Colombia
[4:03:22] gave
[4:03:24] me it's a work of it's a 50 years 50
[4:03:27] years of
[4:03:28] ministry it affected me
[4:03:33] tremendously I was not able to to stand
[4:03:35] in the Pulpit any
[4:03:37] longer
[4:03:40] sometimes you
[4:03:44] faint so the the church was
[4:03:48] there I had to take my health
[4:03:54] seriously I came where the Lord
[4:04:01] was where the Lord starts and ends in
[4:04:04] America in
[4:04:07] America
[4:04:09] because did you know that the
[4:04:11] first when
[4:04:15] God stood on
[4:04:19] the here on Earth and when the the light
[4:04:22] came
[4:04:23] forth it was in New Mexico in
[4:04:27] Texas haven't you read from the
[4:04:34] prophet the Earth was started in America
[4:04:39] and the earthquake is in America as
[4:04:42] well read the message
[4:04:55] well so for me this was a marvelous
[4:04:57] surprise this this great
[4:05:01] invitation and although I was a little
[4:05:03] delicate of of
[4:05:06] Health I uh I talked to my son my son
[4:05:10] and my son-in-law and daughter so that
[4:05:13] they would bring
[4:05:16] me you know how the children are with
[4:05:19] you don't don't you're like like a kid
[4:05:26] again it's the the children and the
[4:05:30] grandchildren and I began to look at
[4:05:33] myself I
[4:05:36] had
[4:05:40] I hadn't checked my ID
[4:05:43] card and I thought it was 30 years
[4:05:50] old you're 80 years old they told
[4:05:55] me I went up to the next floor
[4:06:04] floor the three friends started in
[4:06:07] mystery

[4:06:14] myself I'm I'm the one that's left as a
[4:06:19] [Applause]
[4:06:36] witness
[4:06:46] [Applause]
[4:06:52] and I thank God because he said
[4:06:55] something and now I
[4:07:00] realize God is never left without a
[4:07:06] witness
