foreign [Music] [Music] we'll see keep falling Air Force peaceful time because foreign [Music] come on we are so hard we are [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] came to bring Familia valenciadas a balance to the families a balanced message a balanced Doctrine that's what we'll be speaking Familia Valencia a balanced family Zechariah Chapter 4 verse 10. for who has despise the day of small things for they shall rejoice [Music] with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth we'll read another scripture in Daniel it's close to Zechariah Daniel chapter five Daniel capido Los Cinco Daniel chapter five I hope everyone is well this morning I'm very glad to see everyone Daniel 5 27 Daniel 5 27 thou are weighed in the balances and are found wanting let us pray Heavenly Father we give you thanks my God for one more opportunity for your mercies because we don't deserve it Lord just to know we don't deserve it should be enough foreign foreign henceforth families are unbalanced they focus too much on one area there are people that are too Republican and people who are too tired or people that are too legalists there's people that don't like black people nowadays we see people are more fond of our ex-presidents and there are people that hate him and another group of people hate another group of people all because people go to an extreme this is they're a Democrat nor Republican I am a citizen of a Heavenly Kingdom and all of politics are rotten there's nothing good about it absolutely [Applause] but people now and they are extremists that's the type of world we live not just in the political world but also in the religious World there are people that are two legalists and there's people that are too liberals and both extremes are incorrect where God came to bring us a message that is a balanced message coming no it came to set us in the middle of the race and not go too much to the edge to the point where we're going to uh in the in a deep interest so I know we're not speaking on them but it has to do a little bit and I'm taking the description Zechariah this is for who has despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice instrumental now notice this is that God puts in the handsome I believe he said in the hands of the seventh messenger that brought the message as an instrument usually used by Carpenters Builders people that build things an instrument that it's not leaning too much to the left or too much to the right normally it's a string peso and on the bottom it has yes if it's an iron or wood uh but there's something heavy weighing it holding it down so make sure that the line is centered and it's straight from top to bottom that it's not unbalanced because if something is built on balance doesn't matter how strong the material is there will be problems and all the in the message I'm not a legalist this is he says I am not a legalist how many believe this this is [Applause] but I believe that each one had a Doctrine but they run off on the deep side of it they just stayed with us and didn't balance the thing up there's a highway and away is the road a highway over here entry in El Camino but get in the way Entre en el camino get in the way saw your neighbor get in the way don't be on the highway oh don't be on the gutter and they'll be on the gutter yes because they build roads a certain way so that the trash in water and all the water is and it's the filth or garbage that is going to the edge but the way is in between the way Isaiah says there shall be a highway and away which brings the highway you remember how they called it the way in the Bible all that was found in the this way they say is that you need to stay in the middle of the way familiar now I want to bring this to the or the lives of in our homes of family because there are people familias there are families I esposos there's husbands there's children that have gone too far to the edge they've been unbalanced completely and that's why their families are falling to pieces that's why churches are falling that's why Christians are falling because to keep standing you need to have a balance you cannot keep a balance you will fall foreign [Applause] you cannot use your strength it can be very strong in your arms and be weak at the legs and all the muscles you have on your upper body don't matter if your feet or legs can't balance it are you with me brother that's why we fall so much that's why we're derailed very easy Diablo that's why the Devil beats us because we can't stay standing see what brother Brown continue saying this Amigos friends I've always tried to keep a balance Del Camino of the road you get way off on foreign equal just as foreign ties Luke or Steve and both are wrong Familia now what happens in the family a lot of things I go on in a family that are in extreme that's why the family foreign [Applause] but it's not the only word a story about a father saying that his daughter was stolen diapers calm down yeah [Applause] he tried to calm his daughter down until she fell crying she was quiet and so she was quiet and when they got home says that he wants to go change your diet and he noticed that inside her diaper there was a piece of ice he said he felt so horrible in there maybe one of his uncles or nephews that were playing with his daughter and she was complaining she didn't know how to express what she was feeling yes Father for being too legalists didn't take time to investigate and it's he says that's how we are that's how we are sometimes Brothers we don't take the time to here find out what's wrong is black God in one occasion Ally he wanted his people to cross through the Promised Land but they weren't ready he even sent spies to go and spy on the land but they weren't ready and what did God do it did he force them do you know God doesn't Force anyone because you aren't ready let's wait for you 40 years until you grow a little this is that is our God he wanted to kill other people and start again with Moses and Moses stood between God and the people and said God if you do this what will they say forgive them brother Branham says God heard Moses the spirit of Christ prayer changes things change God's mind Moses could change what God was about to do legalists we take an extreme the man has the final word when he became to be king the older counselors or Elders that were his counselors told him Solomon for the people to be on your side you should make these changes don't burden them so much don't do these things the people will be on your side and what did salmon do is he heard the voice of other young friends and they better that never followed him again and that's why parents mothers and fathers lose their children they take an extreme they tell their children you're gonna do this because you're going to do it and there's no way of getting out of it you know you need to be very careful Holy Ghost leading you a lot of dance you imbalance your household and it causes you to take an extreme now God says through Daniel yeah I'm returning to Daniel 5 27. Thou Art weighed in the balances and are found once God is a balanced God a type of Jesus Christ he also created Lucifer and Lucifer was all similar differences the only difference was that he could not create but in everything else he was the same to balance he had to make luciferos Valencia God is a god of balance not only did he leave her with a cane Regency [Applause] the correction they made correct attraction how they love Corrections there's people that love correcting but to bring out a drop of love from them you know what you're you're more wrong for doing that then if you just left things in the hands of God now there's others I go to another extreme that give their children everything they give their wife everything you spoil them and they're completely spoiled they never want anything they want to please and you already want to be there [Applause] [Applause] fear of Our Lives yeah that's right so there's people that go completely to once they don't want their families it's not just them that has a headache but the whole family stays at home that's going to benefit them you should come instead and pray for them you think you should do everything for your family but he doesn't give her everything he he uh tests he says in the world he should have affliction do not be surprised doesn't want his family to suffer is causing them to lose blessings from God stay dwarfs spiritually and you're denying the power because it's guard that watches you cannot be there 24 hours a day watch them 24 hours a day but there's people that take another extreme and they don't care what their children do it that's the Other Extreme they don't watch their children they let them do what they want that's incorrect giving them to the devil oh what your children are doing but not force them foreign I am balancing there's a balance there's a center means our weight in the balances so you got wages in the balance repeat God weighs me in the balance estebien for a a balance to be right there has to be weight on both sides he can't just give us all blessings because the balance is needs to come to balance it is and also he can leave us alone that protects us that helps us spiritual is the same type there's people that are very legalists in church that hate seeing someone that that isn't how they should be let me tell you you're lost foreign put some weight on the other side let not mercy and Truth forsake thee find them write them upon the table Yeah find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man notice it's not only the truth it's not only the truth God doesn't only want worshipers in truth there's people that hold on so much and they forget the mercy this is it says let not Mercy for safety there are two things the truth is Mercy is something else [Applause] you aren't forgiven yes christovino Jesus Christ came not to remove the law he came to balance he came to add on to the law prosecutors when they brought the woman found in adultery before him if he would have taken a legalist side Moses says to kill her kill her so balance things God does not take away he balances it because that's the only way to be strong if you only have good devil you'll be weak if you only have evil you'll be weak pero balances repeat I need both things but we also need a mercy when you correct your children remember you need both things [Music] so balance there are children that you tell them one word and they do it but there are children 10 times it seems they don't understand sometimes what they need is to balance things so that they can receive strength does a better job when you encourage them and support them only criticize him that's scientifically proven a person does a better job when you encourage and support them then when you only criticize them this was intolerance that's everywhere not only do your children need to be corrected they need to be praised you need to tell them you're doing a great job son I'm proud that you're thriving God is a balance who God gives God demands is that God's word god Demands a lot let me tell you brother God has given us a lot has given us too much may God help us families with our families giving us a balanced message it stays in the middle until this then God says we know the scripture very well Ecclesiastes three so everything there is a season repeat everything again everything not the problem is that we take a side on certain things instead of saying I need to add on of everything not just Corrections not just sweetness but there needs to be sweetness this is so everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven a time to be born a time to die a time to plan any time to pluck up it's time to kill and it's time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up so if you see something wrong go against it in the name of the Lord but then rebuild it don't leave it the problem is that we don't balance things we're very unbalanced hey man if you're going to correct something do it but later go and pick up that Fallen child my son you can do it I'm here with you I won't leave you I heard a saying somewhere I know the Bible says it this way but I enjoyed more how I read it says it said a father then 10 000 teachers but a father someone there with you someone I will suffer with you someone that will stand next to you someone you can count on he'll show you more some he'll show you more than ten thousand characters but the problem is we only want to be teachers sometimes and not parents support them are you with me brother Valencia a balanced family verse 8 says a time of war and a time of Peace what's wrong is that sometimes we like War more than there's people that like War more than peace fighting they only enjoy attacking and killing you need to know what's a fight and what's a lead yes arrows need to be fast choose without receiving a reward just because you want a victory that's the same in church and in the family there's people that love work those people cut my head off and kill me it's boring and there's people that are on the other side love and you scold them and they want to leave the church but you need both things our God is a balanced God you need both things so if you're on the edge start getting closer to the middle because there's people that have told us why do you play volleyball you should be all the time in prayer and fasting why do you go on vacation I just heard it this morning I wasn't searching for it to spend time reading the Bible we're too unbalanced there's people that have left the church because we play volleyball they don't balance things they don't realize that we need everything in this yeah we need both Good and Evil yeah read second Peter 3 14. I'm going to skip that one First Corinthians 10. Temptation taking you but such as a as is common to man but God is faithful repeat God is faithful repeat God is faithful tell your neighbor God is faithful righteous is God who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able to with the temptation also make a way to escape where the Bible says [Applause] and it says God gave her children righteous God [Music] can come this is Brother Branham says I don't want to get too deep on this but on the Prophet Elijah now looks son nervousness is the hardest thing there is worse than cancer because you can't mentally balance yourself right do you do we realize some of us are mentally unbalanced many of us are mentally unbalanced we only see the mistakes only focus on this on that what the Bible says add praises to the Lord when you feel sad how good God has been with you God has been good with us [Applause] [Applause] pray for people amen yes this is [Music] James fighter 513 is any among he Afflicted let him pray and things will be balanced as any Mary let him sing songs God has always provided a balance God has always provided medicine [Music] families here Voice of Truth Tabernacle we need to balance ourselves we're too unbalanced disappointed we're unbalanced so your sadness a little bit of Thanksgiving so your pain um it was that spiritual bomb [Music] so what the devil brings to you the promises of God for your life Jesus Christ told the Pharisees you focus so much importance left the most important thing that is the mercy righteousness [Music] More Love let me tell your brother everything can be good if everything was good [Music] would it be rotten spoiled so don't complain for the bad also remember the good Lord add to your pain well God has also given me I know that everything is necessary and you're home [Music] and God has blessed you economically don't be greedy don't save everything you have also don't spend it all but use it [Music] for your family for God for the kingdom of God there's people that save too much that don't that barely feed their children [Music] that's an extreme yes or yes brother and there's people that spend way too much [Music] her salary belong to someone else [Music] wants a balanced family [Music] be corrective be merciful don't be chauvinist because God gave it to you hear them and ask God for guidance [Music] don't give your children everything they want are you hearing me parents are our parents here my children or do anything to my children how to do when something happens you won't be able to protect them from everything and only ruins them [Music] that's how he balances things how many love him how many give thanks to God [Music] [Music] [Music] it's here to help God bless you [Music] in the praise [Music] [Music] I'm
