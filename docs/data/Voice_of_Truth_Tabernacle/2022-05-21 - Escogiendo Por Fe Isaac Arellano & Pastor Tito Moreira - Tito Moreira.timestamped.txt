[18:37] one more time
[18:54] [Music]
[18:59] you can turn with me in hebrews chapter
[19:02] 11
[19:04] verse
[19:05] 23
[19:08] 1733 hebrews 11 23
[19:46] by faith moses when he was born
[19:50] was hit at three months of his parents
[19:53] because they saw he was a pr proper
[19:56] child
[19:57] and they were not afraid of the king's
[19:59] commandment
[20:08] by faith moses when he was come to years
[20:12] refused to be called the son of
[20:14] pharaoh's daughter
[20:22] choosing rather to suffer affliction
[20:25] with the people of god
[20:27] than to
[20:28] enjoy the pleasures of sin
[20:31] for a reason for a
[20:44] of christ greater riches than the
[20:48] treasures in egypt for he had respect
[20:51] unto the
[20:53] recompense of the reward
[21:00] of
[21:05] by faith he forsaked egypt
[21:08] not
[21:09] fearing the wrath of the king
[21:13] for he endured and see in him who is
[21:16] invisible amen
[21:27] lord jesus christ we thank you for one
[21:29] more day
[21:34] and for giving us the opportunity to
[21:35] come and speak your word
[21:40] and also be with my brethren that are so
[21:43] special
[21:45] which are the children of god
[21:50] may you
[21:52] flow through this building
[21:56] may
[22:10] of this service
[22:15] help me uh jesus and my brother and my
[22:18] pastor brother tito
[22:21] amen in the name of jesus christ amen
[22:23] buen tomas ascientos
[22:48] for us to understand a little bit about
[22:50] moses uh we need to go back
[23:06] and exodus 1 8 says
[23:08] amen
[23:14] gracias
[23:25] now there now there are rose up a new
[23:28] king over egypt which knew not joseph
[23:34] is
[23:38] and he said unto his people behold the
[23:40] people of the children of israel are
[23:42] more
[23:43] and
[23:44] mighter than we yeah
[23:48] we're gonna
[23:54] and i'm going to change to my my first
[23:56] language so i can help my brother a
[23:58] little bit and uh for context
[24:02] if you read exodus one and two
[24:06] exodus
[24:08] it talks about the death of joseph
[24:12] jose and it speaks how when joseph was
[24:15] in power
[24:28] because joseph had favor on them
[24:33] and but now joseph passes away
[24:38] and now there's 400 years of slavery in
[24:40] egypt
[24:44] so now there's a new pharaoh a new king
[24:46] joseph are you nuevo faraon are you
[24:48] nuevo rey that knew nothing of what
[24:51] joseph did
[24:54] yo jose but now the this pharaoh sees
[24:57] how many hebrews there are in egypt
[25:04] and that's where they began to enslave
[25:06] them
[25:10] because they feared that they would
[25:12] empower the egyptians
[25:21] amen now amen that was a little bit of
[25:24] context
[25:36] amen
[25:37] just to not make it longer his father's
[25:39] name was abram
[25:49] [Music]
[25:53] however you want to say it okabe
[26:06] we're gonna be speaking about moses
[26:53] i know we spoke about faith already
[26:57] now there's faith again in moses
[27:01] there's so much more and other brothers
[27:02] will have the opportunity to speak of
[27:04] other things
[27:29] well i can explain the word of god
[27:57] and
[27:58] so if faith disagrees with science
[28:26] and we must make the choice that moses
[28:28] did
[28:52] plus a rewarder of those that seek him
[28:55] digitally
[29:55] are perishable
[29:57] now we would think of moses and this
[29:59] great time of his life
[30:05] we read becca and the historian of his
[30:07] birth and how god cared for him
[30:11] historian how god cared for him at his
[30:13] birth
[30:16] but there comes a time in moses life
[30:26] if we read we find out that he was the
[30:28] son of pharaoh's daughter amen
[30:43] pharaoh of egypt he was next in line to
[30:45] be fed
[30:50] so as he's looking around as he comes to
[30:52] the age of accountability
[30:57] he's seen through the palace with
[30:58] pharaoh el mira en el palacio
[31:02] and
[31:03] imagine
[31:04] distinct moses and the pharaoh seen
[31:06] through the windows of the palace
[31:15] and
[31:16] all that pharaoh saw it
[31:20] they were seeing the same slaves
[31:25] but pharaoh was seeing the slaves that
[31:27] were building egypt
[31:44] and moses as a young man
[31:52] you know
[31:54] all that the slaves were good for the
[31:56] pharaoh
[32:11] that's the way the egyptians looked at
[32:13] the hebrews
[32:17] or the children of israel yes
[32:19] but when moses looked it
[32:23] out it was different how he looks
[32:48] he knew he was looking at the people of
[32:50] god
[32:54] he didn't see them as slaves
[32:57] they were god's chosen people
[33:02] and maybe sometimes here
[33:04] we see some of us enslaved
[33:08] siendo esclavos but just like moses
[33:13] he went to deliver a message
[33:17] we also have the rights
[33:22] of rights
[33:36] is
[33:49] i would have jumped at the opportunity
[33:51] to become pharaoh
[33:55] because i was i would have been
[33:57] pharaoh's daughter
[34:04] farah what would you guys have done
[34:07] queue look you'll still be right you're
[34:09] next in line to be the king
[34:14] that's tough right
[34:18] to become the king of egypt
[34:22] to have the whole world at your feet
[34:26] but what a foolish thing says brother
[34:28] branham
[34:32] that young
[34:39] when moses chose to take his place with
[34:42] the afflicted and suffering people of
[34:44] god
[35:00] god's people
[35:04] [Music]
[35:05] moses saw beyond the pleasures of sin
[35:12] but now what if pharaoh could have seen
[35:14] what moses saw
[35:25] he saw the sufferings of the people
[35:29] he knew what the price was to paint
[35:35] but by faith he chose it
[35:38] rather than to have the pleasures of sin
[35:41] and
[35:50] [Music]
[36:39] brethren
[36:41] abraham gave him the choice
[36:44] and god gives you your choice
[36:47] the word says chooses they who you will
[36:49] serve
[37:34] what abraham said
[37:38] he saw the opportunity to graze his
[37:40] cattle
[37:41] opportunity
[37:43] to have a better and fatter cattle
[37:47] and as they move on we find
[38:16] um
[38:33] [Music]
[38:35] he was a stranger but he was a smart man
[38:40] he said maybe i'll become the chief
[38:42] manager
[39:40] fields
[39:44] he didn't see himself escaping
[39:48] to a little city somewhere for his own
[39:50] life
[39:54] he didn't
[40:09] pharaoh would have seen his nation
[40:11] drowning
[40:16] but moses saw it
[40:20] and it wasn't by science
[40:23] but moses saw it by faith
[40:25] [Applause]
[40:27] everything that he did was by faith
[40:31] just like god promised abraham
[40:34] dios promised
[40:51] fuera
[40:52] moses
[40:55] had rather
[40:56] el preferio
[40:59] when he could have been the son of
[41:01] pharaoh
[41:04] and half the glamour of the world
[41:09] he'd rather be the son of abraham
[41:14] than to be the son of pharaoh
[41:17] the son of abraham
[41:20] the despise los que es los espressiados
[41:23] then to be the pharaoh de ante
[41:27] and the king
[41:29] but moses had to make a choice
[41:46] your faith has to fight the fights
[41:51] just like moses didn't fear the wrath of
[41:54] the pharaohs
[42:04] and i'm going to be closing if you want
[42:06] to stand with me brother
[42:09] and this is very important here if we
[42:11] can all pay attention this is
[42:16] of course when he sees
[42:18] that he is defeated
[42:24] he wanted to give moses and the children
[42:26] he said
[42:30] brother branham says that he said all
[42:33] right i'll tell you what i will do
[42:39] you all just stay in the land and go out
[42:42] and sacrifice to your god
[42:49] but
[42:50] that's the way the devil works
[42:55] he wants you to keep things
[43:06] he says
[43:07] you can be religious this is
[43:12] why don't you go over and join some
[43:14] church
[43:17] you don't have to do all these other
[43:19] things
[43:22] go here go there they don't have to do
[43:24] that over here
[43:36] but he don't want you to get out of the
[43:38] land
[43:51] just bring the world in with the church
[43:58] the devil's trying to bring the high
[44:00] things of god
[44:06] so that they can mix them down here
[44:11] the people won't look above this
[44:16] they just look down here
[44:20] they all
[44:35] es la misma cosa get out of the land
[44:38] salga de la tierra amen our brother
[44:41] titus will be coming mr mano tito
[44:44] god bless you
[44:46] [Applause]
[45:02] the type of the lord jesus christ
[45:05] hey with me moses represents represents
[45:09] the lord jesus christ
[45:12] moses
[45:16] when he was a child and he was a baby
[45:19] they tried to kill him
[45:22] just like the lord jesus christ
[45:26] when he was a baby
[45:28] they tried to kill him
[45:30] uh
[45:38] [Music]
[45:43] had received news
[45:57] send out to kill all the the the young
[46:00] males
[46:04] all that were all that were being born
[46:07] he asked that the midwives
[46:10] [Music]
[46:51] and then she lets him go
[46:53] los
[46:54] nilo she
[46:59] [Music]
[47:02] in the same river where all the other
[47:04] young babies were dead
[47:07] but she was trusting in the lord that's
[47:08] right
[47:20] believing that god would take care of
[47:22] him
[47:27] and god took care of him
[47:29] god guided him
[47:32] to the house of pharaoh's daughter
[47:36] where she was bathing
[47:44] [Music]
[47:50] she names him moses
[47:52] significa because moses means
[47:56] brought out of the water
[48:00] out of the water
[48:08] and as he is growing in the house of of
[48:10] pharaoh
[48:15] no
[48:16] pharaoh's daughter knowing
[48:31] so that they would take care of him
[48:35] and they bring a jock bed
[48:42] so that she would raise moses
[48:46] so moses
[49:13] he grew up with two options
[49:22] that he came for he that he was a hebrew
[49:24] the queen
[49:27] that his he had hebrew blood
[49:41] there was the one of egypt
[50:11] it means you have two options yes that's
[50:13] right
[50:15] so moses
[50:17] had options yes
[50:21] he had the options
[51:43] how many of us have struggled with those
[51:44] options
[51:47] i can imagine moses
[52:44] at the same time
[52:59] why do you want to be our prince as well
[53:05] is it not enough for you just to be
[53:07] prince of the egyptians
[53:10] that shows us
[53:12] that most
[53:25] and he thought he could remain in both
[53:26] worlds
[53:28] are you with me yes that's right
[53:32] now up to that point
[53:35] he had not made a choice
[53:38] and many of us especially
[53:40] especially
[53:53] because you've been uh
[54:07] father and mother tell you one
[54:22] and it's
[54:36] that
[55:04] all
[55:32] we're
[55:59] oh
[56:54] make your own election or
[56:57] i'll see you choice
[57:02] we're in church and we're living in both
[57:04] worlds
[57:08] he chose
[57:20] he had to be brought out of egypt
[57:28] when they found out he killed the
[57:29] egyptian to save the hebrew of his
[57:31] hebrew brothers
[57:33] he went fleeing
[57:36] to the to the desert to the wilderness
[57:52] that's where he had to make his uh
[57:54] choice yes
[57:57] what he would do
[58:03] there's a story about moses
[58:06] when he was a young child a baby
[58:11] the tradition of the stories of the
[58:13] hebrews
[58:18] they said that when moses was a baby
[58:22] he grabbed pharaoh's crown in this
[58:25] moment
[58:26] at that moment pharaoh
[58:30] became a little fearful
[58:32] you became a little worried
[58:36] he said this young child will perhaps
[58:38] will want to take my throne
[58:44] you know how we take these small omens
[58:45] or the symbols of the future
[59:03] and on the other side they put a a a a
[59:05] hot coal
[59:06] miner they wanted they wanted to see
[59:08] ciel
[59:09] if he would go after the gold
[59:14] corona
[59:17] or if you just wanted to see if he just
[59:18] grabbed that crown because he liked the
[59:20] shiny gold things
[59:23] or the shiny things
[59:28] because i i would call it that is lit up
[59:31] it it shines it is a it is a la story
[59:35] and the hebrew story says
[59:38] that this baby
[59:41] he was about to go get uh the ghosts
[59:56] and when he grabbed this hot coal he put
[59:57] it in his mouth
[1:00:11] it harmed his tongue
[1:00:54] to exodus
[1:01:08] and i want you to see what is happening
[1:01:13] why the devil is so scared of you making
[1:01:15] a choice this is
[1:01:17] exodus one
[1:01:19] verse 8.
[1:01:26] a new king over egypt which knew not
[1:01:28] joseph and he said unto his people
[1:01:35] behold the people of children of israel
[1:01:37] are more and mightier than we yo
[1:01:40] i asked myself
[1:01:45] if the devil can't see you further than
[1:01:47] what we can see
[1:01:48] el puede
[1:02:02] is
[1:02:06] do you realize that
[1:02:08] you realize that the devil
[1:02:10] is scared of you
[1:02:13] do you realize that the devil
[1:02:16] of what you are capable of
[1:02:22] [Music]
[1:02:31] but the devil knows
[1:02:50] it says behold the people of children of
[1:02:51] israel are more and mightier than we are
[1:02:56] come on let us deal wisely with them
[1:02:59] unless they multiply
[1:03:00] yeah
[1:03:28] if we recognize
[1:03:41] but it's not enough
[1:04:22] therefore they did send them taskmasters
[1:04:24] to afflict them with their burdens and
[1:04:25] they built for feral treasure cities
[1:04:32] and they built for them treasures
[1:04:35] cities for pharaoh python and ramesses
[1:04:52] the more the devil afflicts me
[1:04:57] the more they multiplied and grew
[1:05:05] and they were greed because of the
[1:05:07] children of israel
[1:05:09] well the devil doesn't realize
