that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of the throne of god jesus christ and we'll go to luke chapter 2 verse 26 and it reads like this this i see and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lord's christ let us pray heavenly father father celestia we'll serve we're so grateful with you this uh morning lord for your love and your goodness and the mercy you show uh to us every every day we asked you you would speak to your people father efforts that they made lord senor van dierer uh to uh come to your house father veneras that you would just speak to their hearts you would just supply their needs because that's why we come here lord [Music] and that you would just anoint the lips that are speaking you would be with my interpreter as well and at the end of the service may the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen uh you may be seated brothers uh for a title common and just for a thought waiting for that day esperando el dia you know uh just kind of reading a little bit on simeon when i first started reading the message of the hour elements i would read quite a bit and i always found that brother branham he preached it it seemed like you know why he talked about these these older folks you know there's not a whole lot said about them in the bible they were people that were waiting there were people that were expecting personas and you know i think that's how we should come to the house of the lord you know we should come to the house of the lord expecting they amen amen but when we expect something i believe that uh not only do you do should you expect it is when we expect something oh you know you have to you have to prepare for it you see because your preparation i will determine your expectations you see because [Music] i just haven't been able to quite get away from this scripture i don't have it on there got it he talks about el avla he he this is the calling of abraham now and we uh we know that that he called abraham [Music] i will show you i will make you a great nation i will make you a blessing you see i will make i i will make you a great of nation pueblo you see he just keeps saying aye aye and that's it's it's not abraham talking here you know but it's god you see when i i will make you a great name i amen amen yes amen you see many times you know throughout our lives we are expecting esperamos oh great things grandes but there's so much uh disappointments we get very disappointed and you know we should probably ask ourselves why aren't our expectations met no ramos why didn't why why weren't the expectations meant you see those are all the questions that we should ask ourselves because if we prepared right if we had the right attitude oh you know the outcome [Music] you may be disappointed with your why and his name is jesus christ he has given me more mercy hello [Applause] we prepare for it you know i i i look around you know and i you know brother tito was saying last week you know how there's just a lot of love going around in the air okay and that's okay yes we need we all need love the greatest love we need you know before any other kind of love it's the love of jesus amen amen i uh i was just kind of meditating on that solos you know they're with great expectations you know and i mean i i would be too yo yeah you know you'd be expecting great things uh but before anything goes down uh you know there has to be a preparation preparation we have we prepare we prepare for everything it seems like you know except for coming to church i promise this is going to be an encouraging message i'm you know the boxing night seems like it's saturday night el salvador back when i was growing up it wasn't so much the ufc but it was it was boxing you see and they and the devil just always trying to beat god to the punch he's like you know i'm a traitor he's gonna try and stop it you know and you know they they just kind of hype up the match hey come on just kind of look at each other and they put them face to face and then all of a sudden they get back and they swing you know and they're just going at each other and everybody's trying to hold them back you see that they're hyping up to five you of this i love you i am your great and exceeding reward compensation and that's who i'm running today that's who i'm looking for the one that called me he's the one that will help me he would not amen [Applause] you amen call us to be spectators i don't like watching people you know enjoy themselves fruity you're just praising god and you know god is just blessed that we won't always be able to praise like somebody else well you know i i want a piece of that but oh i want a piece of jesus and he's willing to give you a piece of him you're willing but you know i'm always you know maybe just like they give me a piece that opportunity you know and i think that that's what we should have we should have a piece of jesus you see that the people out there that the people out there in the world would just have that desire oh you know to just to just have what you have that's solo you know what they would say and if we don't have it day is the moment that it would be right now that every time you came but then it was not invaded i thought you were building oh because because you were prepared more for it we have to prepare for the blessings amen amen come on brother free come on amen i'm in when there's preparation i want you to know that it that it proves just a sensation amen amen amen that's exactly what it proves let's look at brother uh because when you get excited about something uh you know you you are you should prepare for it you should prepare for it i read one time uh you somebody i i can't remember who it was then that's what god has to do caring for your children he's going to see how you where how you're acting in your pose of duty he's going to see how you're teaching those little kids i want to read a quote from brother branham and he says this it's in the message who is this este he says you know unusually where we have services it says you know and usually where we have services we have our regular service and do our worship and fellowship with our people that know nothing of the world and knowing there's something special unless something special does take place there's always something new when he appears and they were charged with expectations oh i hope i hope oh that's one of the sad things about today there will be those who know god [Applause] you know god knows it and he knows it because he knows you've prepared for him he knows you've studied he knows that you've done the word he knows you know about him because you lived like he wanted you to live but he knows who you are i had great expectations and i hope that you have the same kind of expectations i don't want to just house normal expectations you see normal expectations i would not listen to this kind of message one more time would not listen to this kind of message this message is not normal he did not goes to be average so we like it we run like this i believe it you look real my expectations are great he promised us they promised me oh i'd say me yo they go because the promise is individual this [Applause] you know sister daniela's a testimony testimony and i remember her saying that she felt like her heart was going to come out you know and i think that uh that's how we should run this kind of race carrera oh you should keep going you know when things get harder you know you you should you you should know that god is in order to get you in the right condition this race i want to let you know that this race is not to the swift go to ecclesiastes nine verse eleven sierra clastes nine verse eleven capitol nueve versicolo the words of solomon he says this to them is but they have missed the greatest gifts they have not found favor with god that's what he says that the race is not to the swift and i believe and you have to keep working you gotta keep persevering but you gotta keep running and you gotta keep pulling you gotta keep working you say love it but nobody else follows i want to read one more one more quote um he says this in the message uh christ is revealed in his own word and el mensah he says the thing that's the matter with the message today is okay those who obtain it in their hearts must lay in the presence of the sun to get ripened says you can pick up the message and then let the sun bake all the greenness out of you make you mature christians cristianos maduros he says you see what i mean it says the weeds got to get ripe all right and you know i believe yo that if we want to see it has to have the sun you see and when you have the sun you know when you're in the presence of the sun you see that's why i said in the beginning oh you know if i have jesus i have all i need [Applause] you'll get more than what you expect into a relationship and if you you didn't make preparations if the greatness is out of you if the greenness is out of you fuera oh then you then you wouldn't be complaining you wouldn't be complaining i'll tell you what you'd be doing i will tell you what you'd be doing you'd be praising god you're gonna be praising god sweetheart you were in his presence your day and night oh you'd this man was devoted the bible says he was a devoted man he was dedicated he was out of his supposed to do it begins to speak to him and he says simeon rise and begin to walk and i believe simeon yokro quesimeon just made his way he so camino the way the holy ghost would lead him and uh that was probably many doubters [Music] probably you probably have a lot of doubters that said he'll be back he won't hold out too long he won't last very long and no smash there was a lot of people that didn't see jesus that day [Music] you know the book of isaiah says you know i believe it was the chair of cherubims of the seraphim's one of the two croqueta that they would have to cover their eyes no they'd flap their wings with another one and you know they'd cover their feet and they would say holy holy holy edition they couldn't see his holiness they weren't able to see it he was able to hold [Music] [Music] oh [Music] they were able to [Music] [Music]
