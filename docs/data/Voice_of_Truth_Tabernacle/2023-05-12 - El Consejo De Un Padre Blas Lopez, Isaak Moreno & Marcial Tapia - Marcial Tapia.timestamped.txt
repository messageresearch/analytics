[33:22] is
[33:26] the message perfect strength by Perfect
[33:28] week
[33:36] he says here's something that Comforts
[33:38] us
[33:40] there's something here that encourages
[33:43] of weakness
[33:45] encourages us from weakness
[33:49] they say
[34:04] if we get to heaven
[34:11] if we're able to stand or get to the
[34:13] point where we stand before the presence
[34:15] of God
[34:16] along with his church
[34:21] will be standing amongst people
[34:24] that were
[34:27] weakness
[34:30] or cast away from them
[34:33] people that didn't know anything
[34:38] Dios
[34:41] it's not odd that God
[34:46] that God Compares
[34:48] with sheep they say
[34:53] he says the Sheep is the most
[34:56] defenseless and harmless animals
[35:00] Mercy uh insufficient
[35:04] there's not another animal like the
[35:06] Sheep that's unable Brothers Listen
[35:09] Brothers
[35:10] the
[35:13] squirrel can hide it in a tree
[35:17] the dog can bite back
[35:20] the line can rip apart
[35:48] completely insufficient
[36:26] then God takes that person and begins to
[36:28] mold them
[36:35] and in that person in that person's life
[36:38] he does what his hands
[36:43] he does that he does his work now they
[36:47] speak because those lips aren't his
[36:49] they're of God yes
[36:52] and that person
[36:55] God forms a character
[36:59] because that here in the pulpits
[37:04] what we're going to take there what
[37:06] we're going to take to Heaven
[37:13] our character we're going to take to

[41:36] Seattle
[41:46] fuertes it's not that we're too weak but
[41:48] we're too strong
[41:56] we have too much knowledge
[41:59] and God wants to take that away from us
[42:03] he wants to take it is that right
[42:06] we're too strong
[42:09] surrender ourselves before him Brothers
[42:15] I'm going to stop here
[42:20] God bless you
[42:32] I'm really happy to be here this evening
[42:36] amen it's a must to worship God Amen
[42:40] and as a subtitle I put the counsel of
[42:44] the father
[42:46] amen as as our brother was talking in
[42:49] here
[42:50] we see here um that David was giving his
[42:54] last instructions to Solomon
[42:56] instructions we see that
[43:00] um David told them
[43:02] that he was approaching
[43:05] death amen
[43:08] and we see
[43:10] as I was studying this
[43:13] I was saying that
[43:15] when people pass away
[43:18] their last words are very important
[43:22] you see everyone wants to know what what
[43:25] their what their last words are going to
[43:27] be
[43:28] their last words are last Everlasting
[43:31] amen
[43:33] you you know usually we want to know
[43:35] what are they going to leave us
[43:40] um what are they going to tell us what
[43:42] advice are they going to give
[43:44] because they've been they've been
[43:46] through more
[43:47] you see we see uh
[43:51] if we could imagine
[43:54] if my brother if our pastor was up here
[43:57] sinost
[43:58] and if this was his last preaching
[44:01] I believe all of us would be more
[44:03] attentive
[44:07] all of us would want to know exactly
[44:09] what he's what he's saying
[44:12] we wouldn't want to know exactly every
[44:15] word
[44:16] exactly to that last preaching amen
[44:20] and I believe when David was giving
[44:22] advice to his son
[44:27] and what his father was telling them
[44:30] amen
[44:31] you see I see
[44:34] something that I see in here
[44:36] is that the Lord blesses those who walk
[44:39] in his ways
[44:41] we see that David was telling Solomon
[44:45] that he needed to worship God Amen
[44:49] to follow his Commandments
[44:51] to follow the written rules that Moses
[44:54] had had gave Davis
[44:59] and I don't believe David was telling
[45:01] them that because he didn't know God you
[45:03] know
[45:05] I believe Solomon seen David's testimony
[45:09] it was his son amen he lived with them I
[45:14] believe he knew about God
[45:16] what I believe he was telling them here
[45:20] that he needed a personal experience
[45:22] with God
[45:24] he needed something to stir up inside
[45:29] David wanted him to have David
[45:32] something that
[45:48] and
[45:49] Solomon my son learned to know the god
[45:52] of your ancestors intimately
[45:55] is worship them and serve him with your
[45:57] whole heart and a willing mind for the
[45:59] Lord sees every heart and knows every
[46:02] plan and thought if you seek him you
[46:04] will find him but if you forsake Him He
[46:06] will reject you forever
[46:09] is
[46:25] you see this is the new international
[46:28] version that I read here
[46:32] and David's telling them he wants him to
[46:34] know him deeply amen intimately
[46:38] he doesn't want just know David's God he
[46:41] doesn't want him just to know who who he
[46:43] is to David
[46:46] when he wants his son to have experience
[46:51] many times as youth is you see we come
[46:55] to church and when you're preaching is
[46:59] we see our parents in that in the in
[47:02] their steps of the Lord
[47:05] and we want to live off of their
[47:07] experiences
[47:11] but we have to have our own testimony
[47:14] amen
[47:15] my own experience
[47:23] we're going to stay in the same spot
[47:26] I'm going to keep sitting on these
[47:28] benches
[47:30] I wonder why we're in the same place
[47:32] amen
[47:35] amen and it keeps saying verse 10.
[47:40] so take this seriously
[47:42] aura
[47:45] you see in English it says so take this
[47:47] seriously
[47:50] you see David wants him to know that
[47:53] this is serious
[47:56] it's serious that he has a close
[47:59] relationship with God
[48:01] you see and I believe
[48:03] every single one of our parents
[48:06] wants us to have a close relationship
[48:08] with God
[48:11] Dave you know many of us have been in
[48:14] the world maybe
[48:16] or maybe been in both places
[48:19] we maybe come to church
[48:24] we have to choose one amen
[48:27] we can't be in both
[48:29] and it says the Lord has chosen you to
[48:32] build a temple as a sanctuary be strong
[48:35] and do the work
[48:42] and it says then David gave Solomon the
[48:45] the plans for the temple and its
[48:47] surroundings including the entry room
[48:48] the storerooms the upstairs room the
[48:51] inner rooms and the inner Sanctuary
[48:52] which was the place of atonement is
[49:06] David also gave Solomon all the plans he
[49:08] had in mind for the courtyards of the
[49:10] Lord's Temple the outside rooms the
[49:12] treasuries and the rooms for the gifts
[49:14] dedicated to the Lord is
[49:26] you see we see here Aquino zamos cuenta
[49:30] that David gave Solomon almost
[49:32] everything to build this Temple
[49:37] and a lot of the times my parents gave
[49:41] us you know the word
[49:44] they gave us Bible studies they give us
[49:48] advice they almost give us everything
[49:51] but the only thing that they don't give
[49:53] us then
[49:55] no the only thing that they don't give
[49:57] us or can't give us
[49:59] is the work after amen
[50:03] that has to be in US amen
[50:06] we're the ones that have to put the
[50:08] words
[50:09] to build a spiritual Temple
[50:13] spirit I was talking to my brother Alex
[50:15] today at the barber shop
[50:18] we're kind of speaking about the word
[50:21] and we have to build a spiritual Temple
[50:24] here
[50:26] we have to build something for God
[50:29] we go to and worship him
[50:33] and if we read first Chronicles 28 20 a
[50:36] little more down
[50:38] it says then David continued be strong
[50:42] and courageous do the work don't be
[50:44] afraid or discouraged
[50:46] for
[50:48] forgive me Brothers
[51:01] for the Lord God my God is with you he
[51:03] will not fail you or forsake you he will
[51:05] see it he will see to it that all the
[51:07] work related to the Temple of the Lord
[51:09] is finished correctly
[51:14] you see we see here David advise Solomon
[51:20] not to be frightened amen
[51:23] about the size of the
[51:26] taskra you know building a temple or
[51:30] being a king amen
[51:32] fear can't immobilize us many times amen
[51:36] it could prevent us from doing something
[51:40] because of the job
[51:43] the task is
[51:47] you know the pressure of the situations
[51:51] we have fear amen
[51:54] and because of that
[51:56] we end up freezing amen
[51:59] we don't do nothing
[52:01] Nuevo
[52:58] amen see he's the one that's going to
[53:01] give us a strain
[53:03] so start working amen
[53:06] but we have to do something
[53:10] and I want to read a story real quick
[53:14] maybe some have heard it
[53:20] amen
[53:29] it says one day your Fox becomes became
[53:32] very hungry as he went to search for
[53:34] some food it is
[53:38] he searched high and low but couldn't
[53:41] find something that he could eat
[53:45] finally he has his stomach rumbled he
[53:48] stumbled upon a farmer's wall
[53:51] uh
[53:55] at the top of the wall he saw the
[53:57] biggest juiciest grapes he had ever seen
[54:03] they had a rich purple color
[54:07] Rico telling the fox they were ready to
[54:09] be eaten
[54:13] to reach the grapes the fox had to jump
[54:15] high in the air paral cancer
[54:18] as he jumped he opened his mouth to
[54:21] catch the grapes but he missed
[54:28] tried again but miss yet again
[54:32] he kept trying and trying a few more
[54:34] times but kept failing
[54:37] finally the fox decided it was time to
[54:39] give up and go home
[54:43] he walked away he muttered I'm sure the
[54:46] grapes were sour anyway
[54:51] you see many times we're in church amen
[54:55] we don't want to do nothing amen
[54:58] because we say oh if we do something
[55:01] oh they're not going to notice it
[55:03] anyways
[55:04] why am I going to do something
[55:53] amen that's right
[55:57] before my time finishes
[55:59] just something else that I seen
[56:03] and this was that yesterday God keeps
[56:06] his promises
[56:09] amen if we read if we read verse 10
[56:13] and First Kings chapter two and put him
[56:16] and say what first or second uh second
[56:20] uh First Kings chapter two
[56:24] it says then David died and was buried
[56:27] with his ancestors in the city of David
[56:35] oh yeah
[56:40] I'll just read it let me real quick and
[56:42] David had reigned over Israel for 40
[56:45] years seven of them in Hebron and 33 in
[56:48] Jerusalem
[56:49] Solomon became a king and sat on the
[56:52] throne of David his father and his
[56:54] kingdom was firmly established
[57:04] oh that's not it amen you see we see
[57:07] here that God kept his promise amen
[57:11] and you see we see God's going to keep
[57:13] his promises in our life
[57:16] well God promises he's not going to take
[57:18] away
[57:20] God keeps his promises
[57:23] because he can't take him back amen
[57:27] and one way I was listening to the to
[57:31] the title that our brothers put on
[57:33] um for tonight
[57:37] we must worship God Amen
[57:41] I believe one way that we that we could
[57:43] do that is
[57:46] by serving amen
[57:49] our brothers
[57:51] and being there for them
[57:54] not just in our Circle that we have no
[57:57] solos
[57:59] but getting out of our comfort zone
[58:02] I'm talking to new people amen
[58:04] foreign
[58:27] he
[58:32] went to the dining hall and saw that
[58:35] even though the food was plentiful
[58:36] everyone's Health was bad one more time
[58:39] he saw her he went to the dining hall
[58:41] and saw that even though the food was
[58:48] everyone's Health was bad it La Salud
[58:53] he whacked his brain for a clue to solve
[58:56] this riddle uh
[58:59] um
[59:02] Enigma he then found that the
[59:04] inhabitants were given long long-handled
[59:07] landos to use while eating
[59:09] give slower bro he then found that the
[59:12] inhabitants
[59:15] were given long-handled laddles to use
[59:19] while eating
[59:23] this was such a difficult and awkward
[59:25] way to eat yes
[59:31] that hardly any food reached their mouth
[59:37] as a result they were starving
[59:41] after several meals in Hell the man was
[59:44] suddenly transported to Heaven
[59:49] at first he was overjoyed
[59:54] then he went to the dining hall
[59:58] and was dismayed to find that the same
[1:00:01] laterals were used there it is
[1:00:07] however everyone looked happy healthy
[1:00:10] and well fed but
[1:00:14] then he noticed that instead of trying
[1:00:16] to feed themselves yes
[1:00:20] their inhabitants were serving each
[1:00:26] others
[1:00:28] the selfishness of those in Hell had rap
[1:00:31] had
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:34] their thinking to only focus on
[1:00:36] themselves
[1:00:41] and the generosity of those in heaven
[1:00:44] had enabled them to think of each other
[1:00:49] and
[1:00:50] in doing save each other
[1:00:55] you see we see two situations
[1:00:58] some were being selfish
[1:01:01] in other words helping and serving each
[1:01:03] other
[1:01:06] you see and if we just help each other
[1:01:08] out
[1:01:09] amen
[1:01:19] would be much better off
[1:01:26] [Applause]
[1:01:30] Hermanos
[1:01:33] Stan brothers
[1:01:43] and as you're getting there
[1:01:46] why don't you turn to your side
[1:01:52] it is time for me to worship
[1:02:02] [Applause]
[1:02:09] the scripture says
[1:02:19] [Music]
[1:02:21] but the hour of cometh and now is when
[1:02:24] the true worshipers shall worship the
[1:02:25] father in spirit and in truth
[1:02:31] for the father seeketh such to worship
[1:02:34] him
[1:02:47] it's a difficult time we're living
[1:02:53] to be able to worship God in the time in
[1:02:56] the present times we're living
[1:02:58] I don't believe it's impossible
[1:03:02] with all of our hearts
[1:03:06] one thing I like about King David
[1:03:10] he was a worshiper
[1:03:13] who was the worshiper since he was born
[1:03:22] because that is what he was taught
[1:03:34] [Applause]
[1:03:52] but if you have a problem or if you have
[1:03:55] problems
[1:03:57] um Santo
[1:03:59] you know foreign
[1:05:33] day by day
[1:06:16] hold on
[1:06:17] much
[1:07:27] you know foreign
[1:08:08] now
[1:08:10] a
[1:08:12] miramos we see Como
[1:08:15] Fayo King David felt right
[1:08:21] that he had the face because
[1:08:28] when you fail
[1:08:30] a consequences there are consequences
[1:08:34] but I'm going to tell you this brothers
[1:08:38] that God will never leave us
[1:08:41] He Loves Us independent
[1:08:45] independently look
[1:08:49] independent of what we do okay
[1:08:53] because Brothers
[1:08:55] this flesh
[1:08:57] it's very stinky do the things of this
[1:09:00] world so the pleasures of this world
[1:09:05] don't criticize
[1:09:24] of any problems
[1:09:37] I am a witness
[1:09:40] I'm a man
[1:09:44] as Elijah says he was a man of passion
[1:09:48] I'm also a man of passion foreign
[1:10:27] hear King David
[1:10:29] he goes to call it all of his kingdom
[1:10:33] porque
[1:10:37] because he was going to express
[1:10:40] what God has shown to David now Brothers
[1:10:47] God has not given us
[1:10:51] to guide them to produce God has given
[1:10:54] us
[1:10:56] the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:00] and many times
[1:11:06] [Music]
[1:11:08] and I put it
[1:11:12] because many times we come very easy
[1:11:16] the devil has heard us
[1:11:19] that he has not allowed us to be free
[1:11:22] but it's time to be free
[1:11:25] to be able to guide our children
[1:11:28] to the things of God brothers
[1:11:31] so that our children
[1:11:33] can see
[1:11:38] so that our children can see
[1:11:42] is
[1:12:36] listen listen to me for a little bit
[1:12:43] King David couldn't do it because he was
[1:12:45] a man of war and had nothing too much
[1:12:49] possibly we Hermanos
[1:13:40] okay
[1:14:33] and it's going to place us to feel
[1:14:35] something uh beautiful
[1:14:37] we're going to be wasting our time
[1:14:41] because God doesn't move through
[1:14:43] feelings
[1:14:58] just as God chose you
[1:15:01] okay Hermanos okay Brothers
[1:15:04] I'm going to read a little bit here
[1:15:10] and it says like this is
[1:15:14] and of All My Sons
[1:15:16] for the Lord has given me many things he
[1:15:20] had chosen Solomon in my son
[1:15:24] to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of
[1:15:26] the Lord over Israel
[1:15:28] is
[1:15:38] for I have chosen him to be my son and I
[1:15:40] will be his father how beautiful
[1:15:43] Brothers
[1:16:00] with all over your heart
[1:16:02] and it says
[1:16:10] moreover I will establish his kingdom
[1:16:12] forever
[1:16:20] my Commandments and my judgments as at
[1:16:22] this day
[1:16:25] now he is telling him to stop
[1:16:30] we have to work amen Brothers
[1:16:49] come on you
[1:16:51] uh
[1:16:59] I have to do it by my own choosing
[1:17:05] and
[1:17:06] he says to be constant
[1:17:10] the
[1:17:46] and leave it for an inheritance for your
[1:17:48] children after you forever
[1:17:51] now he is telling them bro
[1:17:54] it is an inheritance
[1:17:57] that we can leave that inheritance
[1:18:05] and it's a chain
[1:18:07] reactions
[1:18:12] to serve God
[1:18:15] you're gonna have children
[1:18:17] and what are you going to give to your
[1:18:19] team what are your children
[1:18:23] what father
[1:18:25] does it not hurt them
[1:18:29] see a son who's a drug addict
[1:18:32] or out on the streets prostituting them
[1:18:37] to do whatever they feel like
[1:18:40] what parent is
[1:18:53] if you're not careful foreign
[1:19:46] look at the advice of David to Solomon
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:20:03] for the Lord searches our hearts
[1:20:07] what does that mean to say Holiness
[1:20:11] do you think you can hide from God
[1:20:15] do you think that what you're doing
[1:20:17] Secret is is
[1:20:34] knowing that God is searching my heart
[1:20:40] how beautiful it is
[1:20:51] foreign
[1:21:49] I am a very needy person myself
[1:21:52] but Brothers tonight
[1:22:03] and be
[1:22:31] allowing himself to be guided as well
[1:22:34] amen Brothers
[1:22:41] I know we're possibly accustomed to
[1:22:44] feeling a lot of things
[1:22:46] but the older I get
[1:22:49] Sonos
[1:23:44] to fight off anything that gets in our
[1:23:46] way
[1:23:47] if it's unbelief
[1:23:54] any problem
[1:23:57] s
[1:24:11] if we cry then we cry what's the problem
[1:24:15] God gave us eyes to cry
[1:24:18] if our heart hurts what is the problem
[1:24:23] God gave us a strong heart problem
[1:24:31] s
[1:24:49] am I going to give my heart

[1:47:44] but it's his love
[1:47:46] it wasn't only his love
[1:48:16] for a moment
[1:48:26] recognize the god of your father
[1:48:32] is
[1:48:35] like if someone's introducing someone
[1:48:38] else
[1:48:42] special
[1:48:45] like David is giving Solomon especially
[1:48:49] tell him something about the certain
[1:48:51] person uh
[1:48:54] my son Solomon recognize your your
[1:48:57] father's God okay
[1:48:59] David how beautiful that David
[1:49:04] do not tell him recognize
[1:49:07] all I've done
[1:49:10] keep doing what I do
[1:49:13] he says recognize the god of your father
[1:49:16] don't recognize your father
[1:49:20] your father is
[1:49:24] recognize the god of your father
[1:49:26] can say is
[1:49:29] only by himself
[1:49:55] God of your father
[1:50:00] get to that conclusion in our lives
[1:50:03] everything has been for him
[1:50:06] recognize the god of your father
[1:50:09] and serve him
[1:50:12] perfect heart
[1:50:16] I asked myself what type of heart are we
[1:50:18] serving him
[1:50:20] we can serve him with a halfway heart
[1:50:24] many of us are serving him that way
[1:50:30] with a complete
[1:50:33] dollar heart
[1:50:41] it was his last words
[1:50:50] but I believe for David it was something
[1:50:52] great
[1:50:54] for David it wasn't any other thing that
[1:50:57] he was telling him
[1:50:58] it wasn't out of his sleep
[1:51:02] meditated on it very much if
[1:51:06] you seek it you will find it
[1:51:11] think about that
[1:51:13] security what are you saying there's an
[1:51:16] assurance
[1:51:18] what are you saying
[1:51:28] you will find
[1:51:31] don't you like to know that is insured
[1:51:46] two levels
[1:51:53] it's an insurance
[1:52:08] I will find it
[1:52:11] it's an assurance
[1:52:22] penetrate that in our hearts
[1:52:26] take that into our hearts
[1:52:29] if we seek him we will find him
[1:52:49] but my God
[1:52:51] the god of your father
[1:52:58] how beautiful is
[1:53:07] enjoy the story of David
[1:53:09] he was a great man
[1:53:12] a giant is
[1:53:21] it's very little what we talk about
[1:53:25] there is so much
[1:53:27] that we can learn from David
[1:53:30] go and read the story
[1:53:33] go over it learn it
[1:53:35] of how David was
[1:53:38] I believe if there's a person Jesus
[1:53:45] you can learn many things from David
[1:54:06] next week
[1:54:07] um
[1:54:13] if there's one person I want to know
[1:54:15] it's David

[1:54:22] I mean
[1:54:24] the petitions
