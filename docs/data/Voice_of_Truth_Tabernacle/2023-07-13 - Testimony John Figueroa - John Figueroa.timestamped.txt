[18:36] John chapter 11.
[18:43] it's The Story of Lazarus
[18:48] and how the Lord raised him from the
[18:51] dead
[18:56] now on this day we're going to do
[18:58] something different
[19:02] brother John testify you know and he'll
[19:06] be sharing with us
[19:10] I believe it's a miracle is
[19:24] mentioned some things about the church
[19:26] and what's going on with them
[19:30] let's read there in John 11 28.
[19:44] and when he and when she had so said she
[19:48] went her way and called Mary her sister
[19:49] secretly saying the Masters come and
[19:51] call it for thee hey Noel
[19:56] as soon as she heard that she arose
[19:58] quickly and came unto him this is
[20:06] now Jesus was not yet coming to the town
[20:09] but was in that place where Martha met
[20:11] him
[20:20] the Jews and which were with her in the
[20:23] house and comforted comforted her when
[20:26] they saw Mary that she rose up Paisley
[20:29] and went out followed her saying she
[20:30] goeth unto the grave to weep there Maria
[20:32] cuando llego Jesus
[20:42] then when Mary was come where Jesus was
[20:45] and saw him she fell down at his feet
[20:47] saying unto him Lord if thou has been
[20:50] here my brother had not died
[21:00] when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and
[21:03] the Jews also weeping which came with
[21:05] her he groaned in the spirit and was
[21:07] troubled
[21:11] and said where have you laid him they
[21:14] said unto him Lord come and see Jesus
[21:16] Jesus wept
[21:20] then sir the Jews behold how he loved
[21:23] him
[21:26] and
[21:29] some of them said could not this man
[21:32] which opened the eyes of the blind have
[21:33] caused that even this man should not
[21:35] have died
[21:41] Jesus
[21:48] therefore again groaning in himself
[21:50] coming to the Grave it was a cave and a
[21:52] stone lay upon it Jesus
[22:00] Jesus said take away the stone Martha
[22:03] the sister of him that was there Satan
[22:05] to him Lord by this time he stinketh for
[22:07] he hath been dead for days
[22:18] believe thou should see the glory of God
[22:21] says
[22:24] Jesus
[22:30] then they took away the Stone from the
[22:33] place where the dead was laid and Jesus
[22:34] lifted up his eyes and said father I
[22:36] think see that thou has heard me
[22:39] oh yes
[22:45] and I knew that thou hears me always but
[22:49] because of the people who stand by I
[22:51] said it that they may believe that thou
[22:52] has sent me yeah
[22:59] and when he thus had spoken he cried
[23:02] with a loud voice Lazarus come forth
[23:04] sudario
[23:15] and he that was dead came forth bound
[23:18] hand and foot with grave Claws and his
[23:20] face was bound about with a napkin Jesus
[23:23] saith unto them loose him and let him go
[23:27] when Jesus resurrected him
[23:31] he didn't resurrect him
[23:34] for the that entire time
[23:39] throughout that entire time he had an
[23:41] illness until he died
[23:44] when Jesus resurrects him he didn't
[23:48] resurrect him
[23:51] he resurrected completely whole
[23:54] and he lets us know
[23:57] everything Lazarus went through era para
[24:00] La Gloria was for God's glory
[24:04] so God would be glorified
[24:09] and we believe everything our brother

[47:33] let's read there in the book of numbers
[47:41] as you are nor some of you might not
[47:43] Wednesdays
[47:49] it's a Bible study normally
[47:52] apocalypses and regularly we've been
[47:54] speaking on Revelation in specifically
[47:59] iglesiasis specifically the seven Church
[48:02] ages of Revelation
[48:05] now we're going to put that aside
[48:09] number one for hearing brother John
[48:14] also there's other things happening in
[48:16] the church
[48:20] and what we're going to speak is for
[48:23] every member
[48:24] um
[48:25] if you're visiting God bless you uh
[48:30] I hope this is and frying you something
[48:33] out of the norm uh
[48:37] hopefully you can receive something
[48:40] numbers seven this is
[48:55] and I came to pass on the day that Moses
[48:58] had fully set up the Tabernacle and had
[49:00] anointed and Sanctified it and all that
[49:02] instruments thereof both the Altar and
[49:04] the vessels thereof had anointed them
[49:06] and Sanctified them and today
[49:18] that the princes of Israel heads of the
[49:22] House of their fathers who were the
[49:23] princes of the tribes and were over them
[49:26] that were numbered offered
[49:30] now I'm going to read it faster now
[49:34] friends
[49:41] [Music]
[49:43] and they brought their offering before
[49:46] the Lord's covered and 12 oxen a wagon
[49:50] for two of the princes and for each one
[49:52] of one and ox and they brought them
[49:54] before the Tabernacles is
[50:04] saying take it off take it of them that
[50:07] they may be able to do the service of
[50:09] the of the Tabernacle of congregation
[50:12] and thou shall give them unto the
[50:14] Levites to every man according to a
[50:15] service
[50:18] um
[50:25] foreign
[50:42] for dedicating of the altar in the day
[50:45] that it was anointed even the princes
[50:47] offered their offering before the altar
[51:04] and his offering was one silver charger
[51:07] the wait thereof was 130 shekels one
[51:10] silver ball of 70 circles after the
[51:12] Shrek of the sanctuary both of them were
[51:14] full of fine flower mingled with oil for
[51:16] meat offerings
[51:20] one spoon of 10 shekels of gold full of
[51:22] incense
[51:41] and for sacrifice of peace offering
[51:43] talks in five rounds five he goats five
[51:45] lambs of the first year this was
[51:47] offering of not Sean the son of Amina
[51:51] dab is
[51:55] on the second day Nathaniel the son of
[51:57] zor Prince of issachar did offered
[52:00] Plateau de
[52:11] he offered for his offering once over
[52:14] charge of the way whereof was a 130
[52:16] shekels one silver bowl of 70 shekels
[52:19] after the shack of the sanctuary both of
[52:20] them follow Farm flower mingled with oil

[52:46] offering to walks in five rounds five he
[52:48] goes five lamps of the first year this
[52:49] was offering of Nathaniel the son of zor
[52:51] system
[52:52] you continue reading this chapter
[52:55] you'll realize
[53:04] mentions every item these princes gave
[53:08] um
[53:18] does anyone know
[53:27] is the longest chapter in the entire
[53:30] Bible uh and and and
[53:39] more than 100 verses speaking what God's
[53:42] word is
[53:45] almost our entire chapter is on God's
[53:48] word
[53:50] I don't believe it's a coincidence it's
[53:53] the longest chapter okay
[53:57] I believe speaking of God's word is one
[54:00] of the most important things
[54:02] and it does deserve the longest chapter
[54:05] of the Bible
[54:09] of God's word
[54:12] is
[54:20] over God words what God's word
[54:27] the second longest chapter of the Bible
[54:34] hear me you should know right okay this
[54:38] is I've mentioned it before
[54:40] foreign
[54:43] second longest chapter in the Bible
[54:46] is this one
[54:49] Numbers chapter seven
[54:53] what is this chapter if you read it
[54:57] you might get bored
[55:02] principles
[55:05] it's naming every item every prince
[55:07] offered porque Dios
[55:10] Tanta
[55:13] tantos why does God need all this space
[55:17] here
[55:21] to name the offerings of these princes
[55:25] I believe if he wrote it there is
[55:29] because it matters to God
[55:32] is
[55:35] importante because it's important
[55:38] what matters to God
[55:52] Numbers Chapter 7 is the second longest
[55:55] chapter in the Bible
[55:57] and I don't think it's a coincidence
[56:01] I think God is trying to tell us
[56:03] something
[56:07] importa that it matters to him
[56:10] [Music]
[56:13] what a son or daughter of his gifts to
[56:17] him
[56:18] no I know when we speak these things
[56:23] we got a little uncomfortable yes
[56:33] as well I'm not a fan of speaking about
[56:35] money and those things
[56:51] unfortunately for some of us
[56:56] the Bible speaks more about money
[57:01] and what it speaks about heaven or hell
[57:08] so and speaking about money I'm speaking
[57:10] the word of God is that fine with you
[57:16] I want to give you a little bit of
[57:18] backstory and where we are
[57:21] um
[57:29] what is headed our way
[57:32] and God's will
[57:36] as you know I say
[57:40] s 10 years ago
[57:45] actually 11 years now
[57:48] relocated us to Colorado
[57:54] [Music]
[57:55] and we arrive without not knowing anyone
[57:58] is
[58:09] my brother Marcos would cook breakfast
[58:11] for me
[58:14] uh eggs with
[58:16] sausage is there a
[58:42] this place was even still too big for us
[58:46] um as the pero
[58:51] um
[58:51] God hasn't left us
[58:56] a purpose for moving here
[59:01] when we moved we took a step of Faith
[59:05] was a great step of Faith yeah
[59:09] I'm gonna say greater than a step was
[59:13] a great leap
[59:17] we prayed a lot for that decision prayed
[59:21] and Christ prayed and cried
[59:23] we cried a lot
[59:30] all of a sudden we get scared
[59:36] but we believed and we're sure it was
[59:38] God
[59:40] and when we moved
[59:49] we found out with time that God brought
[59:51] us here with a purpose
[59:55] or many Souls
[1:00:05] moved us through many signs
[1:00:08] and we were sure it was God
[1:00:12] I believe 11 years later we can say
[1:00:15] it's worth obeying God
[1:00:18] we're taking a step of Faith
[1:00:22] making a sacrifice
[1:00:25] you can say it's worth making a
[1:00:27] sacrifice
[1:00:28] God hasn't left us
[1:00:33] and blessed us amen amen
[1:00:38] I think it was 2017.
[1:00:43] if I'm wrong correct me please stay
[1:01:16] there's been many problems uh
[1:01:21] he
[1:01:36] also the neighbors of that property uh
[1:01:40] um
[1:01:40] the famous George Familia and his family
[1:01:44] he is
[1:01:53] not sure what's going to happen
[1:01:58] the 18th of this month
[1:02:01] 18 or 19.
[1:02:07] we have a meeting with our lawyers and
[1:02:09] their lawyers
[1:02:13] and try to have an agreement somewhere
[1:02:49] foreign
[1:03:12] and expand this place
[1:03:36] at a good price
[1:03:39] um
[1:03:41] is
[1:03:45] [Music]
[1:03:53] this is a report
[1:03:56] so we've given them an offer this is 750
[1:04:02] 000
[1:04:04] 770
[1:04:05] 000.
[1:04:09] sorry
[1:04:10] 70
[1:04:13] 770 000.
[1:04:15] este
[1:04:18] Para
[1:04:25] a realtor the realtor told me
[1:04:32] that someone gave him a verbal offer the
[1:04:36] cash okay
[1:04:38] of 750.
[1:04:44] so we want her to offer more than one of
[1:04:47] them
[1:04:51] would have to get a loan uh Anton says
[1:04:56] so we offer them
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:01] also have another offer written down
[1:05:07] so far they have our offer and someone
[1:05:10] else's offer
[1:05:13] pero
[1:05:22] the Realtors said that they liked us and
[1:05:25] they're considering our offers
[1:05:32] the board of directors who get together
[1:05:34] and decide which offer they want
[1:05:38] from now till Sunday they'll have maybe
[1:05:40] more offers
[1:05:44] that's the first part
[1:05:49] let's say they accept our offer enters
[1:05:53] then the next phase is
[1:05:59] to make sure we can get the loan
[1:06:08] I spoke with some banks
[1:06:11] that was Fargo I was a Wells Fargo
[1:06:17] Banker Banks they usually don't help
[1:06:21] be involved in those things
[1:06:24] I went to two other Banks
[1:06:28] and they're open to helping us with the
[1:06:31] loan and Don says
[1:06:34] um
[1:06:34] uh
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:07:42] there's other people responsible
[1:07:45] um
[1:08:18] seeing our situation and finances the
[1:08:28] they're trying to make sure that we can
[1:08:32] receive a loan all right
[1:08:34] as possibly now it's possible
[1:08:38] on down payment
[1:08:40] they might require a down payment
[1:08:43] [Music]
[1:08:45] they said for a church
[1:08:49] it can be all the way up to 30 percent
[1:08:54] and I tried to make it 25 percent
[1:08:58] for the cost of the church
[1:09:11] can go is 20 but maybe 25
[1:09:15] um Lando
[1:09:22] if someone does a math 25 of 770 is how
[1:09:27] much uh 190 about 190 right price is
[1:09:34] um
[1:09:38] speaking about 190k uh
[1:09:42] so you give a down payment for the loan
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:10:01] but what's likely is that we might need
[1:10:03] to give a deposit to get the loan
[1:10:08] so when we speak about figures like this
[1:10:13] we all get nervous
[1:10:16] we all get very nervous
[1:10:19] um
[1:10:19] Para
[1:10:24] para parallels
[1:10:26] using our money to pay for the lawyers
[1:10:29] and engineers
[1:10:32] and everything else is
[1:10:38] so we have to almost raise all this
[1:10:41] money uh
[1:10:43] entonces
[1:11:09] you guys have a high chance
[1:11:14] the building
[1:11:18] where you'd have seen it
[1:11:23] the biggest problem would might be just
[1:11:25] parking lot
[1:11:29] there's a lot of parking around
[1:11:32] um
[1:11:41] can you put some of the pictures 56
[1:11:45] um is there
[1:11:48] this is
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:11:58] it's like a bow
[1:12:04] it's like about 20 000 square feet you
[1:12:08] know what
[1:12:13] happens
[1:12:16] he was going to choke with the amount of
[1:12:19] money we're gonna give
[1:12:22] pero um
[1:12:25] they're about 20 000 square feet
[1:12:29] and for a perspective
[1:12:32] everything that we have here
[1:12:35] [Music]
[1:12:36] kitchen the rooms
[1:12:40] we have 3 300 square feet
[1:12:46] so we're talking about
[1:12:49] multiply this is
[1:12:52] how much more spacers over there
[1:12:57] um
[1:12:59] so we're speaking about a great church
[1:13:05] and 70
[1:13:09] 770 is a gang into bargain or bargain
[1:13:12] forgive me
[1:13:18] it's a very good night
[1:13:22] for these measurements
[1:13:29] many of the buildings the size are
[1:13:31] around 2 million
[1:13:34] and they're even smaller
[1:13:37] um
[1:14:00] this is another smaller Sanctuary they
[1:14:02] have next to the main sanctuary
[1:14:05] um
[1:14:06] okay
[1:14:12] I think easy 350 people
[1:14:16] only in the sanctuary
[1:14:25] about 400 when you fit chairs in it's
[1:14:29] them
[1:14:36] conference rooms Library rooms rooms for
[1:14:39] children
[1:14:41] restrooms and everything else
[1:14:43] um
[1:14:46] he
[1:14:49] is
[1:14:59] a lot of space you can get lost
[1:15:10] it has a basement the same size as the
[1:15:13] sanctuary another room on top of that
[1:15:16] not just the sanctuary the whole
[1:15:18] building this basement
[1:15:27] um
[1:15:29] so
[1:15:31] um assistance
[1:15:38] I want you to prepare this is the way
[1:15:41] God leads us
[1:15:43] if they accept a different offer he he
[1:15:47] is
[1:15:56] that's all I believe God has everything
[1:15:58] planned
[1:16:03] here and everything else
[1:16:06] so it's not stopping us
[1:16:11] we're going to keep working
[1:16:16] but if they accept our offers
[1:16:19] we're gonna have to move quickly
[1:16:24] so come up with that money
[1:16:29] this is
[1:16:31] 192 000.
[1:16:35] 192 500.
[1:16:38] um
[1:16:40] um hold on
[1:16:43] the
[1:16:47] these so now there's no plans of selling
[1:16:51] the properties
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:16:59] we can keep using it as a fellowship
[1:17:02] foreign
[1:17:18] El Primera
[1:17:20] obstacles
[1:17:22] the first obstacle is
[1:17:27] the second will be qualifying for the
[1:17:30] loan
[1:17:33] and the third one is the deposit the
[1:17:36] down payment all right with me
[1:17:39] okay
[1:17:41] um
[1:17:46] we're not speaking of any numbers
[1:17:53] we struggle to raise 25kland
[1:18:05] speaking about a different place in
[1:18:07] different country it's our place in our
[1:18:09] city is
[1:18:13] the future of our children everything
[1:18:16] else Anton says
[1:18:19] um
[1:18:21] let's say okay
[1:18:30] if we divide 192.
[1:18:36] and 60 men let's say that
[1:18:39] foreign
[1:19:01] and it's not so complicated
[1:19:04] Anton says
[1:19:09] um
[1:19:10] uh
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:10] is everything for us
[1:20:14] um
[1:20:16] so I warn you with this I I advise you
[1:20:21] but uh
[1:20:23] so you can prepare porque sinus
[1:20:27] because if they accept our offer in
[1:20:31] and we qualify for the down payments
[1:20:36] so inside of 30 days
[1:20:39] 30 40 days
[1:20:44] have that down payment ready
[1:20:47] Anton says
[1:20:49] um
[1:20:52] something to pray about
[1:20:55] something that you meditate on
[1:20:58] um
[1:21:09] and if God does not provide it
[1:21:13] was not his will
[1:21:15] law
[1:21:53] foreign
[1:22:33] that's the case brother
[1:22:36] um
[1:23:05] and I just received a good news to know
[1:23:08] God's given you a beautiful church
[1:23:10] and I saw you in God's love
[1:23:14] and the faith we should already have
[1:23:17] impossible I know it might seem
[1:23:19] impossible
[1:23:22] all things are possible
[1:23:31] speak the word yes and that church will
[1:23:35] be yours Korea
[1:23:46] so I believe okay
[1:23:49] considencia nothing is a coincidence
[1:23:55] there are many things I point that God's
[1:23:58] moving
[1:24:02] how God showed us this church before we
[1:24:05] spend money here
[1:24:10] we haven't signed the contract here yet
[1:24:14] we're ready to move uh
[1:24:20] God is awesome so they're sending more
[1:24:22] souls so I don't think it's a
[1:24:25] coincidence
[1:24:26] I believe God is moving
[1:24:30] now it's only up to us
[1:24:40] then we are aligned in God's plan
[1:24:44] knowing we're doing God's will
[1:24:47] um
[1:24:50] live one thing I've always told you okay
[1:24:52] my brother Brandon
[1:24:55] God does not owe anyone
[1:24:58] the Bible says in Galatians
[1:25:02] so he shall reap Port Antonio
[1:25:17] if there is one thing God does not
[1:25:19] forget
[1:25:21] that's what we do for his work
[1:25:35] you know where we are
[1:25:39] but
[1:25:42] everything is
[1:25:47] everything else is up to us
[1:25:50] I tell you this
[1:25:54] is
[1:25:58] building a church today it's more than a
[1:26:01] million and a half
[1:26:05] and let's say we decide later today
[1:26:22] as he came

[1:28:40] good comments uh

[1:29:39] you can use a credit card to donate
[1:29:42] there's no problem
[1:29:46] um
[1:29:59] but it's not a lot because we've been
[1:30:01] using it for everything
[1:30:06] with the lawyers
[1:30:09] and the engineers
[1:30:14] and giving payments
[1:30:17] everything else
[1:30:23] we definitely cannot depend on those
[1:30:27] um

[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:07] am
[1:32:10] yours
[1:32:13] damn again

[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:39] [Music]

[1:32:54] iciones we're going to be reading the
[1:32:56] petitions
[1:32:59] okay
[1:33:11] to the lawyers
[1:33:15] we have been paying them every time they
[1:33:17] charge us
[1:33:18] um
[1:33:22] foreign
[1:33:29] if we decide to rent another place we're
[1:33:32] talking about eight thousand to ten
[1:33:34] thousand dollars a month
[1:33:38] those are the buildings that we have
[1:33:40] been looking at
[1:33:42] we're talking about eight to ten
[1:33:44] thousand dollars a month in cambios
[1:33:47] so if we get this loan
[1:33:50] um
[1:33:52] we're looking at about six thousand
[1:33:54] dollars a month in tons is
[1:33:58] e e yes
[1:34:01] and that's something that's going to
[1:34:03] remain constantly mucho
[1:34:06] um
[1:34:10] a lot more space than what the buildings
[1:34:12] offer nowadays
[1:34:14] [Music]
[1:34:21] and then the things that we have to do
[1:34:23] to this place
[1:34:25] we're talking about fifteen thousand
[1:34:28] dollars
[1:34:59] so you can just have an idea
[1:35:02] um
[1:35:06] there's a lot of possibilities and
[1:35:09] there's many different ways
[1:35:13] and I believe between everybody we can
[1:35:15] give an idea
[1:35:21] let's put as an example of the
[1:35:24] acceptance offer we let go of this this
[1:35:25] opportunity
[1:35:30] and we're not going to know when when is
[1:35:33] the next time
[1:35:34] because there's not a lot of churches
[1:35:38] especially in that condition
