[24:33] master of the eunuchs and he should
[24:34] bring certain of the children of Israel

[25:05] knowledge and understanding science in
[25:08] such as her ability in them to stand in
[25:10] the king's Palace in whom they might
[25:12] teach and learning and the tongue of the
[25:14] children
[25:18] verse 8 is
[25:36] but Daniel purpose in his heart that he
[25:38] would not defile himself with a portion
[25:40] of the king's meat nor would the wine
[25:41] which he drank therefore he requested of
[25:43] the prince of the eunuchs that he might
[25:45] not defile himself
[25:46] Brothers

[26:13] by Your Word

[27:20] because in this time
[27:39] how hard it is for the Youth
[27:43] so it hurts
[27:49] Daniel
[29:47] that takes courage
[30:29] God is a gentleman
[30:36] to choose
[31:00] and the truth is
[31:04] sometimes we don't care what the word
[31:06] says it says that's the truth is

[45:00] is not of the father
[45:02] what is of the world
[45:05] Amen you may take your seats brothers
[45:13] and diving into the word Brothers
[45:17] talked about this last week
[45:20] so we can see in Daniel chapter one
[45:24] The Kingdom of Israel
[45:28] was taken over and conquered
[45:32] by Babylon poor Babylonia under the rule
[45:36] of King nebuchadnezzarena Daniel chapter
[45:40] 1 verse 1 and 2 says Daniel Capitol
[45:43] in the third year of the reign of
[45:45] Jehovah Kim King of Judah came
[45:47] Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon unto
[45:50] Jerusalem and besieged it
[45:53] is
[46:00] verse 2 and the lord gave Jehovah king
[46:04] of Judah into his hand with part of the
[46:06] vessels of the house of God yes
[46:16] which she carried into the land of
[46:19] shinar to the house of his God and he
[46:21] brought the vessels into the Treasure
[46:24] House of his God
[46:32] already
[46:45] that he should bring certain of the
[46:47] children of Israel
[46:49] and of the king's seeds
[46:53] principles
[46:58] after conquering Israel you see the
[47:02] Bible says that he also took treasures
[47:05] and captives
[47:09] back to the kingdom of Babylon
[47:12] you see in the Bible shows
[47:17] was captured
[47:20] and taken to
[47:23] Babylonia along with others
[47:26] including the three Hebrew men
[47:29] you see but they weren't taken as
[47:31] prisoners
[47:42] he was looking for young men
[48:27] and understanding science and such has
[48:31] had ability and then to stand in the
[48:33] king's Palace
[48:38] and whom they might teach the learnings
[48:41] and the tongues of the Sheldon
[49:23] that they would be easier to influence
[49:27] mama
[49:31] Holiness this world wants to influence
[49:33] us
[49:35] this world wants to pressure us
[49:39] and squeeze us into this movie
[49:43] and to this lifestyle
[49:46] you see it's easy for the Youth to be
[49:49] influenced
[49:51] it's easy for us young people to be
[49:54] influence
[49:56] and if I could be honest tonight
[50:02] we are being influenced by the world
[50:06] and we don't see it
[50:09] you see we could be influenced by
[50:11] friends
[50:16] call me to church and making it a
[50:19] religions
[50:21] you see the devil is not playing around
[50:24] you see the devil is waiting
[50:28] waiting to devour us
[50:31] and he's trying to influence
[50:34] you see we don't see this our phones can
[50:38] influence us sometimes
[50:39] you see sometimes youth areas we spend
[50:43] most of our day
[50:45] we did most of our day
[50:49] to our phones
[50:54] to our daily routine
[50:57] when I say this for me too because this
[51:00] has happened to me
[51:03] there are days where I gave most of my
[51:05] days
[51:10] TV television and all this routine
[51:14] and we can't even give God five minutes
[51:17] of our days
[51:24] spend time with him you see it's sad
[51:28] Brothers sad but it's true
[52:13] but when we lose our foreign
[53:27] you see we are on the verge of spiritual
[53:30] death
[54:14] each day
[55:14] it's fine
[55:32] that we are dying spiritually
[55:43] we are slowly distancing ourselves from
[55:46] God
[55:52] you can fool me
[55:54] maybe you can fool me
[55:59] you're careful God
[56:02] knows what's wrong with you
[56:04] you can say you're fine
[56:06] you can say oh I don't need to come to
[56:09] the office
[56:10] you see but we we are living in times
[56:14] where we need to live in prayer
[56:18] day by day
[56:25] you see we aren't advancing you we are
[56:28] advancing we are moving backwards
[56:32] we don't take accountability of that
[56:44] the devil didn't do it
[57:42] and this is because each of their names
[57:46] centered on the true God
[57:51] you see no matter how hard
[57:54] no matter how hard King Nebuchadnezzar
[57:57] tried to educate
[58:02] obligates
[58:07] and influence these influences
[58:24] although he lived in a corrupted Place
[58:32] sometimes what we need in life
[58:36] is a commitment
[58:38] a commitment with God
[58:42] this is not enough Brothers
[58:44] but Brothers we think that we have all
[59:39] you see there will be times of
[59:41] difficulties
[59:46] I must do that and it will get harder to
[59:48] overcome
[59:50] and as youth it's hard
[59:53] this world will try its hardest to
[59:55] influence
[59:58] it's hard is to influence each and every
[1:00:01] one of us
[1:00:06] hearing receiving and acting preacher
[1:00:08] 1960.
[1:00:11] God don't like compromisers
[1:00:15] does he want his church to look like the
[1:00:18] world
[1:00:20] he doesn't want it to act like the world
[1:00:23] he doesn't want to have anything to do
[1:00:25] with them
[1:00:28] but only to preach the gospels
[1:00:36] God wants separators
[1:00:39] the church wants mixers
[1:01:07] you see this world has nothing foreign
[1:02:41] I have
[1:03:40] does it mean that God doesn't have
[1:03:42] doesn't have nothing for you
[1:03:44] it's not about
[1:04:13] God bless you
[1:04:16] [Applause]
[1:04:24] if the prophet of God said
[1:04:27] in 1977
[1:04:31] after that he saw no light you know
[1:04:35] you'll lose we're 50 years into that
[1:04:41] you could ask yourself what type of
[1:04:43] Darkness we are in today
[1:04:49] estamos I don't know if you desperate
[1:04:53] desperately I don't know if you're awake
[1:04:55] after that
[1:04:57] I don't know after this
[1:05:00] if you're expecting God to come down
[1:05:02] here
[1:05:04] and I think that's the only way some of
[1:05:06] us are going to wake up sometimes
[1:05:07] sometimes
[1:05:11] sometimes I made the prayers
[1:05:13] when I say God reveal yourself to me
[1:05:17] in a great glorious way gloriosa
[1:05:21] but many times God is in front of us
[1:05:25] in such a simple way
[1:05:28] that we look over it time it time and
[1:05:31] time again
[1:05:34] purpose in your heart
[1:05:37] stay with me I will your purpose in my
[1:05:41] heart
[1:05:42] amen that's our desires
[1:05:47] are you purpose something
[1:05:50] and that's something
[1:05:54] that's something concrete
[1:05:57] now we'll take you through this world
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:02] God's not going to lift you up and pass
[1:06:05] you over it
[1:06:09] our God is a God
[1:06:11] that has been tested by fire okay
[1:06:17] has gone through the fire
[1:06:19] and come out of it
[1:06:22] my question is do you want that guy
[1:06:25] that helps you go through the fire the
[1:06:28] fire of this world that just simply
[1:06:31] wants to burn you up
[1:06:34] consumer
[1:06:36] that's the question tonight
[1:06:38] now we're talking about Daniel
[1:06:40] and and meditating on Daniel and Daniel
[1:06:44] you know you you hear what brother
[1:06:46] Samuel says
[1:06:47] King Babylon
[1:06:50] Babylonia I was looking for a certain
[1:06:52] type of young people
[1:06:56] we already know that means the world
[1:06:58] Amen
[1:07:02] the world the devil is looking for a
[1:07:05] type of people amen
[1:07:08] if they can please put it up one more
[1:07:10] time reverse four
[1:07:13] and I got nothing of myself
[1:07:16] I'm simply an echo
[1:07:19] repeating something that's already been
[1:07:21] told to us
[1:07:22] but yeah I believe we have to be
[1:07:26] reminded
[1:07:28] by day that's why he says give us this
[1:07:31] day our daily bread amen
[1:07:34] he said children in whom was no blemish
[1:07:47] are you with me tonight
[1:07:54] and understanding science
[1:07:57] so when I look at this
[1:08:00] I see that these young men already had
[1:08:02] knowledge
[1:08:05] they had understandings
[1:08:11] but yet later on
[1:08:13] after the 10-day fast then now you know
[1:08:16] the the those God gives them wisdom
[1:08:20] he gives them three things
[1:08:26] and skills of literature
[1:08:30] so my question is
[1:08:33] how can someone no more
[1:08:36] if they already knew let's just say
[1:08:39] everything
[1:08:40] like many of us
[1:08:44] I know everything I know that I know
[1:08:48] this I know that don't tell me that Mama
[1:08:50] don't tell me I already know that's our
[1:08:54] excuse that's our answer
[1:09:56] foreign
[1:10:35] [Music]
[1:10:56] myself
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:11:56] video
[1:12:13] Luke chapter 6 says ye love them which
[1:12:17] love you
[1:12:19] Luke chapter 6 verse 32.
[1:12:23] look at it now
[1:12:25] for if ye love them which love you
[1:12:29] what thank you what they think have he
[1:12:31] yeah for Sinners also love those that
[1:12:34] love them
[1:12:38] which do good to you
[1:12:42] what thank you
[1:12:44] come on
[1:12:50] but
[1:12:54] love your enemies
[1:12:59] and
[1:13:03] your reward
[1:13:05] ing Grace
[1:13:07] I think they had a great rewards
[1:13:11] I believe they had a great reward from
[1:13:14] God
[1:13:16] because again to obtain and know more of
[1:13:19] God
[1:13:20] you have to go what he went through
[1:13:26] the trials that this world puts on us
[1:13:31] show that great godly attribute
[1:13:37] and I believe through those 10 days
[1:13:40] these four men would put it into trials
[1:13:46] they were able to obtain such a
[1:13:48] knowledge
[1:13:54] when the King Nebuchadnezzar can notice
[1:13:57] them
[1:14:00] oh brother did you capture that that was
[1:14:04] the only way after those 10 days
[1:14:07] where they were able to be distinguished
[1:14:12] you could tell somebody
[1:14:15] foreign
[1:14:32] they're going through a hard time
[1:14:35] maybe trusting somebody
[1:14:38] for every trusting in their family
[1:14:41] but after all that
[1:14:44] a reward at the end is waiting for them
[1:14:48] I'll tell you a true reward
[1:14:52] something that this world can't give you
[1:14:55] but I believe the children of God
[1:15:00] they desire to go through the trials and
[1:15:04] come out with something more than
[1:15:05] themselves
[1:15:23] I know
[1:15:26] they betrayed your trust
[1:15:30] that you have to look at them
[1:15:33] after that this was this
[1:15:36] It could only be gone
[1:15:39] I believe that these Hebrew men
[1:15:42] oh change something
[1:15:45] Supernatural that the king himself
[1:15:51] recognizes
[1:15:57] has spent time
[1:16:00] obtain of their gods
[1:16:03] and live with their God
[1:16:13] be with your God
[1:16:17] the title is purpose in your heart
[1:16:21] it's a choice
[1:16:24] who you open up to uh yeah
[1:16:28] tonight what is your choice
[1:16:30] this is God do you want to serve
[1:16:36] because maybe you may say
[1:16:39] oh yes I I may not know my Bible
[1:16:43] yeah because they may say oh that's how
[1:16:46] you you're supposed to be okay
[1:16:54] from Genesis to Revelations
[1:16:57] well let me tell you something about my
[1:17:00] profits
[1:17:01] it says in the message The Works that I
[1:17:04] do bear witness of me
[1:17:09] he talks about a brother that came to
[1:17:11] him and told him
[1:17:14] he says well preacher you don't know the
[1:17:17] Greek words
[1:17:20] I said I don't know the Bible right
[1:17:24] can you please put it up right here
[1:17:26] again
[1:17:29] he says you don't know the Bible right
[1:17:33] if you know this word don't mean this it
[1:17:35] means that
[1:17:58] that's right this book is fine that's
[1:18:00] right
[1:18:01] this book is fine
[1:18:03] but I'd rather know
[1:18:07] s
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:22] later on it was needed for
[1:18:26] dawa cause later on we can see in
[1:18:29] chapter two
[1:18:31] a deep calling to the Deep amen
[1:18:34] oh okay if you can just imagine yourself
[1:18:38] a non-believer
[1:18:41] king
[1:18:43] Babylonia asking for something
[1:18:45] Supernatural
[1:18:47] and what about us
[1:18:56] knowing the message
[1:19:04] having the weapons and tools right in
[1:19:07] front of us
[1:19:09] and not taking advantage of that
[1:19:11] opportunity
[1:19:14] let me show you an unbelievable
[1:19:19] we can see what these four men went
[1:19:22] through
[1:19:24] the purpose that they had later on
[1:19:27] [Music]
[1:19:31] the word of God says
[1:19:34] understanding of visions and dreams amen
[1:19:39] many times we obtained things that we
[1:19:41] don't know for what
[1:19:43] I go through trials
[1:19:47] but later on
[1:19:50] this is something I'm barely capturing
[1:19:52] out here
[1:19:53] God let you be called womanizer
[1:20:01] yes
[1:20:05] a drug addict a Hypocrites nobody
[1:20:11] I don't understand why
[1:20:15] but it's not up to me
[1:20:19] maybe God has a bigger purpose for me
[1:20:22] later on
[1:20:24] there's a young man or a sister out
[1:20:26] there
[1:20:29] that may need of someone that went
[1:20:31] through that
[1:20:34] understands that
[1:20:36] has the wisdom and understanding of how
[1:20:39] it is or what it is
[1:20:51] it says right here Daniel chapter 2
[1:20:53] verse five
[1:21:01] asking for something super nice
[1:21:06] it says the the thing is gone from me
[1:21:11] up to this point the kingdom had a bad
[1:21:14] dream
[1:21:17] that nobody could tell him
[1:21:20] he says it's gone from me this is
[1:21:24] if ye will not make known unto me the
[1:21:28] dream
[1:21:29] with the interpretation thereof verse
[1:21:32] five he said um
