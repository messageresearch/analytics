[26:23] reinforcing our uh our gates
[26:27] do you all have the scripture Mandisa
[26:31] says like this
[26:32] is
[26:49] the high priest rose up with his
[26:51] Brethren the priests and they builded
[26:54] the Sheep gate they Sanctified it and
[26:55] set up the doors of it even into the
[26:57] Tower of Mia they Sanctified it unto the
[27:00] Tower of hananil
[27:03] may be seated
[27:08] um Nesta Manana this morning
[27:14] I'd like to focus on the sheep gate
[27:19] in our pastor last week
[27:26] he left it there with the gates of of
[27:29] the city of Jerusalem
[27:32] um
[27:36] and I'd like to read two more scriptures
[27:39] before I go in deeper
[27:43] would be John chapter 10 you don't have
[27:46] to look for it they're just going to put
[27:47] up here on the screen
[27:48] and the Hebrews 11 as well
[27:54] the first scripture says my sheep hear
[27:57] my voice and I know them and they follow
[27:59] me
[28:01] in the second scriptures in Hebrews 11 6
[28:04] is
[28:06] without faith it's impossible to please
[28:09] him
[28:10] uh
[28:36] He also mentioned that that the fivefold
[28:39] Ministries was related to that is
[28:45] I can see the 10 gates to our body and
[28:48] our spirit as well
[28:59] memory I wanted to review those to
[29:02] engage quickly
[29:04] the first one is which one is
[29:12] um
[29:27] the Gate of the
[29:29] gate
[29:31] then it's the Gate of the fountain la
[29:34] puerta del agua the Gate of the water La
[29:36] Puerta de los caballos de Guerra the
[29:39] Gate of the horses of War LA puertas
[29:48] and then it's the Gate of judgment
[29:54] I I get a little lost years
[30:00] so I just want to focus on the sheep
[30:03] gate and as we read
[30:06] the word of God says
[30:09] my sheep hear my voice
[30:11] how many are sheep here
[30:14] our Pastor said
[30:16] pastor
[30:18] a land without a pastor a shepherd
[30:26] and a pastor without sheep
[30:29] a pastor a shepherd
[30:31] is
[30:34] this morning I want to speak on the
[30:36] census a little bit
[30:39] we're taught that we have five senses
[30:44] The Taste here
[30:48] can somebody help me with two
[30:52] hearing
[30:54] the taste
[30:58] God gave us his senses
[31:01] to contact this Earth
[31:10] they are only Earthly
[31:14] I only hear in order that we would
[31:16] contact this Earth is
[31:21] because without that we can't live a
[31:24] normal life
[31:25] because we need to make contact a man
[31:32] there's something we lack no point
[31:36] we cannot live a normal life it is
[31:46] yeah if we were liking something in the
[31:49] natural
[31:50] and we couldn't live
[31:55] how much more of we like something
[31:57] spiritual
[32:00] well if we were lacking the the Natural
[32:02] Science
[32:05] if you were lacking the spiritual Faith
[32:15] man we go by faith amen
[32:24] I'm taking this out of the message the
[32:26] super sense
[32:35] God makes use of these natural senses
[32:40] how much more of the spiritual senses
[32:49] I'd like to read
[32:53] in the message the super sense
[32:58] and it says like this the first quote
[33:01] okay
[33:04] Dios diosos
[33:10] God gave those senses but they're given
[33:12] to you as a gift and I'm gonna switch to
[33:14] English okay
[33:16] and it depends how you what you heal
[33:19] these senses too
[33:24] these senses he's saying
[33:27] needs to be yielded to something
[33:32] and then he says will be the way that
[33:35] your life is controlled it is
[33:40] if I yield my senses to entertainment
[33:47] my senses to hurting someone
[33:51] if I hold my senses to football
[33:55] Americano
[33:57] I'm gonna be led by football
[34:01] I'm gonna be led by by destruction
[34:04] basically yeah
[34:09] well you see what you hear what you
[34:12] taste smell or fear whatever those
[34:14] senses are yielded too
[34:19] they won't dominate you yes
[34:24] it
[34:28] they were given to you for Earthly
[34:30] contact foreign
[34:59] [Music]
[35:29] and one of them is Faith Yuna is FEI and
[35:33] he says it's the one that governs and
[35:34] guides you this is
[35:37] and it's Superior to all the other
[35:39] senses
[35:41] appear to the other five senses
[35:45] how many are with me
[35:50] now back to the Sheep Gates
[35:54] this place was special is
[35:57] because our Pastor said is where the
[36:00] sacrifices came in
[36:06] all that I could learn was from our
[36:09] pastor I couldn't find this anywhere
[36:10] else
[36:13] so I would just be kind of rephrasing a
[36:16] couple things he said
[36:20] is where the sacrifices for the Temple
[36:23] of the Lord came in through it is
[36:28] and the priests and the high priest
[36:32] were in charge of this case
[36:35] and if you read the Bible says
[36:39] that this gay was the only one that was
[36:42] sanctified
[37:12] if we're expecting God to come for us
[37:16] he's not coming he said for goats
[37:20] he's not coming for unbelievers
[37:23] or he's not coming for people that are
[37:26] waiting for him to come still
[37:32] I don't want to get too deep but
[37:38] is the word of God
[37:41] the coming of the Lord has begun already
[37:46] sure ain't bad that's right
[37:50] that's right and if you want to repair
[37:52] your life our pastor says
[37:55] how many need reinforcement in their
[37:58] Gates
[38:00] how many need more armor in their games
[38:13] the scripture we just read
[38:17] was my sheep hear my voice
[38:21] and follow a message and they submit he
[38:26] says they let themselves be letters
[38:30] I made a decision of think uh like a
[38:33] year and a half ago
[38:36] maybe two years ago
[38:38] when I I fully let myself
[38:42] I can't say fully but I'm trying my best
[38:49] to be under the leadership of our
[38:52] pastors
[38:54] you know I've been trying to hear
[38:57] everything he tells me and Obey is
[39:02] because I'm his sheep
[39:05] and he is the Shepherd in this place
[39:09] and the sheep hear the voice
[39:13] and I don't know if sometimes bad things
[39:16] have happened in your life
[39:19] well it's because we don't hearken to
[39:22] the voice of the shepherd
[39:25] and if you ever want to hear the voice
[39:28] of God
[39:29] it's right here it's the voice of our
[39:33] pastors
[39:34] but you know I used to be maybe a little
[39:37] religious
[39:39] and I will just want God to like talk to
[39:43] me in a supernatural way
[39:46] I wanted God to for a lie to appear
[39:51] you know like like a movie you know but
[39:56] it's more simple than that
[39:58] because if God is more simple than that
[40:01] you know he gave us he a body
[40:05] that he could dwell in don't then
[40:27] because it says the sheep hear my voice
[40:33] I also want to bring that scripture we
[40:36] just read
[40:38] it says it says hear my voice
[40:42] tie this together with hearing yeah
[40:48] it says but without faith it is
[40:51] impossible to please him he said
[40:55] and what comes by hearing
[41:00] faith comes by him
[41:02] by hearing my pastor hear me Pastor I
[41:06] receive more faith I can reinforce my
[41:09] natural Gators
[41:12] of hearing
[41:14] amen amen it's not too hard right
[41:18] I'm trying to be as simple as I can
[41:22] by hearing my pastor is
[41:28] I dwindle the opportunity of the devil
[41:32] opportunity of doubts
[41:36] you know of reasoning to come in because
[41:42] I'm I'm being filled
[41:44] by the voice of the shepherd
[41:48] amen amen
[41:55] give me some time I need to take this
[41:57] really slow brother
[42:04] amen amen
[42:11] uh brother Branham continue saying in
[42:13] the message super sense
[42:20] he says this is the
[42:24] oh it's 57 in Spanish okay
[42:27] it says and the super sense is the holy
[42:30] spirit is
[42:34] the faith of God that dwells in you
[42:38] so the super sense is the Holy Spirit
[42:43] and the faith of God can we repeat that
[42:50] is the Holy Spirit
[42:53] and the faith of God
[42:56] and then he says and if you let the five
[43:00] senses be yielded to the sixth sense
[43:06] it will guide you and bring all the
[43:09] other five senses under control of the
[43:12] super sense
[43:17] under the control of the Holy Spirit
[43:21] and faith
[43:24] and he continues saying continuation for
[43:28] it's so far above the natural sense
[43:34] as the spiritual man
[43:37] it's above the natural
[43:41] it's as far as high as the heavens is
[43:44] above
[43:48] the natural man and his five senses
[43:51] foreign
[44:27] so many so many Saints
[44:31] the devil always tries to come in our
[44:34] five senses
[44:40] doesn't matter how strong you you think
[44:42] you are important
[44:44] how religious or devoted you think you
[44:47] are
[44:50] the devil can come in there
[44:53] because to start off
[44:55] the five senses are Earthly
[45:00] they're not spiritual senses
[45:03] amen amen but he says
[45:07] but he cannot touch that super sense
[45:13] that's far beyond his reach
[45:17] that come from God
[45:20] and it's called Faith
[45:23] glory to God
[45:25] I'm gonna be closing Hermanos
[45:35] now how will the Lord come to my life
[45:40] to this church
[45:42] Iglesia to this bride is to my family
[45:47] actually but I mean Familia my I have a
[45:50] new family you think and we need the
[45:53] Lord too
[45:54] and how is the Lord going to come into
[45:56] my family
[45:59] you know I
[46:01] just not just recently recientemente I
[46:05] had a reality check
[46:11] someone's spiritual life is depending on
[46:14] me
[46:16] I don't know if you have that burden as
[46:19] a father or mother
[46:21] is
[46:24] when you not only think of the spirit of
[46:27] their natural life
[46:30] but where were their souls
[46:34] no where's your children's your wives
[46:37] your husband's Souls
[46:40] where are they gonna go
[46:43] so how will the Lord come to us
[46:48] and I would like to finish how our
[46:50] pastor was saying
[46:53] that everyone is
[46:57] and through these Gates
[47:00] God wants to return to us
[47:05] so yielding these senses
[47:10] to the super sense
[47:13] and that comes by hearing yes
[47:16] and sheep here is
[47:19] that's why I really like to talk about
[47:22] this Gates
[47:25] and through these Gates
[47:28] God wants to return to this world
[47:32] to take back his
[47:36] because all this is about the coming of
[47:39] the Lord
[47:41] and how will the Lord
[47:44] if our defenses are down
[47:48] if the enemy can infiltrate at any time
[47:54] God wants to be received
[47:57] where he knows he can be safe
[48:02] although he doesn't need our our
[48:04] security okay
[48:06] who would want to go somewhere where
[48:08] you're not safe
[48:12] you know God wants to have fellowship
[48:16] and and God doesn't want that
[48:18] interrupted
[48:21] that's why there's Gates
[48:23] amen amen
[48:27] and I would like to read one last quote
[48:31] and the message when their eyes were
[48:34] open
[48:37] it says
[48:39] remember there was two trees in the
[48:42] Garden of Eden
[48:45] how many knows that
[48:48] one was of the tree of science the other
[48:50] was the tree of Faith
[48:55] listen the tree of Faith
[48:59] as long as man eat from the Tree of
[49:02] Faith he lived
[49:05] but the first part he took off the tree
[49:08] of science knowledge he separated
[49:10] himself from God
[49:15] and he destroyed himself he says
[49:19] and every time man bites from the Tree
[49:21] of science he destroys himself
[49:41] kills more people than all the wars put
[49:43] together
[49:48] himself off a cobra Obama
[49:54] wonder what he's going to do with that
[49:57] see
[50:00] and now if you read English
[50:03] let's all repeat that at the the last
[50:07] line at the end is
[50:11] on three ready
[50:14] one two now those three science destroys
[50:19] Faith Fields
[50:21] we're talking about building the walls
[50:25] is
[50:27] we're talking about building the gates
[50:34] and how are we gonna build
[50:38] faith and what does faith come through
[50:43] here again
[50:47] Shepherd and Pastor God bless you
[50:51] [Applause]
[50:58] amen how many have rejoiced
[51:02] word of God is very tremendous
[51:06] thank you brother for that word
[51:12] you know something that caught my
[51:14] attention
[51:16] brother Isaac already read the scripture
[51:21] I think our pastor for the trust
[51:25] Fresco right now that I have it fresh
[51:29] before I get into what I have
[51:32] reinforcing the gates
[51:35] the Gate of the sheep
[51:38] something that caught my attention
[51:40] it doesn't close it but it doesn't have
[51:43] a a bolt or deadbolt or a lock
[51:47] everything else talks of dead balls
[51:50] and this one doesn't it's not a
[51:53] coincidence
[51:57] the gate is open
[52:01] the gate
[52:05] I don't know about you but that
[52:08] um that drives me out that it makes me
[52:10] go crazy
[52:12] the gate is open
[52:14] right now it is open
[52:21] I can enter into him
[52:24] to the holiest place
[52:28] it all depends on you and I
[52:32] what we want to do
[52:37] reinforcing the gates
[52:43] telling us when you talked about the
[52:45] self-control Wednesdays
[52:49] and I like what he brought like what he
[52:52] said
[52:53] is
[52:58] just about Todd and seduced the children
[53:00] of God to commit fornication and eating
[53:02] sacrifice to Idols
[53:06] if you look at that yes
[53:22] basically seduce the people
[53:25] to satisfy their body
[53:29] to satisfy something superficial
[53:34] well brother Isaac read a little bit the
[53:36] the science
[53:38] tries to foreign
[54:53] foreign
[55:32] because if you focus on the internet
[55:35] it eventually will come in
[55:39] the promise we focus so much
[55:44] there's nothing there
[55:46] that's what we can't give life foreign
[56:21] foreign
[56:56] I'm very curious about things
[57:00] because I I put it to the test this week
[57:05] how many uh
[57:11] don't raise your hand
[57:13] how many are governed by these these
[57:16] senses five senses
[57:19] I see because I put myself to the test
[57:22] and I've said well it doesn't matter
[57:25] this week
[58:05] grab hold of it
[58:29] and within that there's the soul
[59:27] is within him

[59:39] the letters red we cannot lie
[59:43] to ourselves

[59:56] uh
[59:59] Las puertas
[1:00:01] I would like to put together so you can
[1:00:04] go and and study Brothers
[1:00:06] this is Sunday school Brothers
[1:00:10] your
[1:00:13] um
[1:00:14] I'm a little explosive
[1:00:19] um
[1:00:20] I like to explain a little bit
[1:00:23] if it's something that I've learned here
[1:00:25] is
[1:00:26] to uh stay calm or calm down
[1:00:32] sometimes
[1:00:38] brother Isaac spoke on the gates
[1:00:43] please
[1:00:51] these are the the gates uh
[1:01:04] how they they are tied in Las puertas
[1:01:07] how the gates
[1:01:09] with our senses
[1:01:13] no I can't talk about all of them you go
[1:01:17] home and study a man is
[1:01:21] and then uh if you have questions you
[1:01:23] can we have questions and answers later
[1:01:26] you write them all down brothers
[1:01:28] write them down
[1:01:30] the Gate of the sheep is is the hearing
[1:01:34] the door of the fish is
[1:01:48] why did we put uh affection on there
[1:01:51] because that was the Great Commission
[1:01:53] but
[1:02:01] the Great Commission
[1:02:04] if we don't have love for the people
[1:02:08] there is no love within me
[1:02:11] what will I preach
[1:02:16] that door was very clear right
[1:02:20] because sometimes we want to breathe
[1:02:22] and we're good at preaching them for me
[1:02:27] but we have to when we have to put into
[1:02:29] action the love
[1:02:58] it's just the five external senses
[1:03:03] in other words he lost the battle no
[1:03:05] control
[1:03:11] he's the son of the devil
[1:03:14] isn't that beautiful
[1:03:28] this door here
[1:03:32] I put the smell
[1:03:35] look Brothers
[1:03:37] usted
[1:03:40] we know ourselves well
[1:03:44] there has to come a time in
[1:03:48] your life as well as mine
[1:03:50] where sin the intro you stay within you
[1:04:46] and you have to do yours
[1:04:58] he does nothing
[1:05:10] the gate
[1:05:12] the horse key
[1:05:15] I put a touch
[1:05:19] sorry you know
[1:05:23] was saying that in this gate
[1:05:26] it's
[1:05:28] a gate we're the horses
[1:05:32] they are presented in the battle
[1:05:36] foreign
[1:06:16] a spiritual war going on
[1:06:20] if you feel it in the body
[1:06:35] as well
[1:06:41] okay I'm going to read a quote from the
[1:06:43] prophet here
[1:06:45] is
[1:06:49] remember we're Body Spirit and soul
[1:06:53] I don't want to get too much more into
[1:06:55] the gates
[1:07:03] you just gave a one percent of it here
[1:07:07] just a little bit
[1:07:10] you have to come already
[1:07:14] okay
[1:07:35] this is
[1:07:44] another there are five of Senses that
[1:07:48] control the flesh
[1:07:51] you know what it is
[1:08:13] he says that's to me the hour course
[1:08:16] that's the five things that you can't
[1:08:17] depend on because it's meat
[1:08:19] I'm gonna bring it very simple Brothers
[1:08:22] when you come here to church
[1:08:25] especially here to the to the sanctuary
[1:08:28] you have to poner and control so
[1:08:32] putting into control the five senses
[1:08:35] in order for the sixth sense
[1:08:39] because if you don't do it the five
[1:08:42] senses
[1:08:44] they are defeating you right now
[1:08:48] I'll put it very simple guess
[1:08:52] you can very easily say I'm gonna go to
[1:08:55] the bathroom
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:09:09] to work
[1:09:12] he takes control
[1:09:14] I won't go to the bathroom
[1:09:19] here's the word of God
[1:09:21] but why does the person go to the
[1:09:23] bathroom
[1:09:24] because the five senses
[1:09:28] than anything else
[1:09:35] [Music]
[1:09:48] put them under subjection
[1:09:52] that's why we're we are beat brothers or
[1:09:55] defeated
[1:10:02] we have the inner courts which is the
[1:10:04] next yes
[1:10:09] and the next author enters and answers
[1:10:11] with conscience imagination memories
[1:10:13] passions and affection
[1:11:13] foreign
[1:11:21] have control
[1:11:26] you have to be born again
[1:11:28] foreign
[1:12:11] let's go eat better
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:23] as we take this at least take this with
[1:12:25] you
[1:12:28] put that sixth sense to work
[1:12:32] when the site wants to control you yes
[1:12:36] your mouth wants to speak of the brother
[1:12:38] or sister
[1:12:44] the sixth sense
[1:12:48] because it helps us
[1:12:53] it helps us to avoid getting into
[1:12:57] problems
[1:12:58] and with that we will burden our pastors
[1:13:01] that's how we will help him
[1:13:04] I know the Sheep gate
[1:13:07] it didn't have a a deadbolt like
[1:13:13] he has key right from for the thieves
[1:13:17] but in the spiritual you have access
[1:13:24] you have access to enter
[1:13:28] that's tremendous isn't it
[1:13:32] because maybe I'm getting a little crazy
[1:13:34] but I'm rejoicing is
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:46] the the inner senses
[1:13:58] and there would also be memories and
[1:14:01] conscious and memories and so on
[1:14:03] you shouldn't imagine things
[1:14:06] how do you do it
[1:14:09] you don't do it
[1:14:13] is
[1:14:17] an inner core within you
[1:14:20] foreign
[1:14:45] but
[1:14:49] this morning we don't want to just to
[1:14:51] stay outside
[1:14:54] something I also really liked
[1:15:00] interior between the outer courts and
[1:15:03] the inner Court Avia there was
[1:15:07] there was a Badger's kids
[1:15:22] but that means
[1:15:25] foreign
[1:15:34] T govern you
[1:15:36] or will Faith governance
[1:15:42] that's what the Badgers
[1:15:45] we make the decision
[1:15:48] what will control our governance
[1:15:51] if we are vaccinated this is
[1:16:00] the senses govern us
[1:16:13] Christian or he's of the devil
[1:16:17] it just simply he just
