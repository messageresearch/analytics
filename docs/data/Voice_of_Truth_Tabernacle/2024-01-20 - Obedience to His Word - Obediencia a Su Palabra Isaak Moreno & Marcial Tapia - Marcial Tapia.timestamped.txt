[28:59] brother from
[29:01] californ many brothers from Mexico and
[29:03] just all around the
[29:05] world um I'm gonna ask you guys to open
[29:07] your Bibles to Luke
[29:12] 2 we'll be reading verse 51 and
[29:19] 52 amen we're still speaking on young
[29:22] Jesus
[29:25] amen our title for tonight is um
[29:29] obedience to his
[29:34] word
[29:36] amen and it says like
[29:39] this and he went down with them and came
[29:42] to Nazareth and was subject unto them
[29:45] but his mother kept all these things in
[29:47] her
[29:56] heart
[29:58] 2 and Jesus increased in wisdom and
[30:01] stature and in favor with God and
[30:09] man let's bow our heads in
[30:12] prayer
[30:14] Lord we give you thanks for this
[30:16] wonderful day you've given
[30:18] us to come and hear your
[30:21] word I ask that you may use me and my
[30:24] brother that will be preaching with
[30:26] me
[30:28] that we may speak the right
[30:30] things you may use our
[30:33] mouths our
[30:35] voice and that just may be a blessing to
[30:37] at least one Soul
[30:41] here and most of all to the
[30:44] youth this is a youth
[30:46] service and we just want the youth to
[30:49] rejoice in the word
[30:51] Lord we ask that you may be with
[30:55] us help us and guide us
[30:58] uh we ask this on Your
[31:00] Name Lord Jesus Christ
[31:03] amen amen you may be
[31:06] seated uh today we'll be speaking about
[31:09] [Music]
[31:11] obedience and as we read in
[31:14] Luke we see that God was obedient to his
[31:20] mother or his parents whenever they went
[31:24] back to go pick him
[31:26] up
[31:28] after they had lost
[31:31] them um I believe one of God's love
[31:36] languages is
[31:38] obedience I believe he loves
[31:41] obedience you see it says in the Bible
[31:43] obedience is better than
[31:47] sacrifice and Jesus was a perfect
[31:49] example to
[31:52] this you see um he made it very clear
[31:58] that his Focus was on obeying his
[32:01] father at first you see he's in the
[32:05] temple and he's obeying what his father
[32:08] told
[32:10] him but when his Earthly parents come
[32:12] back to pick him
[32:15] up to take him back
[32:18] home his obedience was there as
[32:22] well you see Jesus was human just as we
[32:26] are
[32:28] um he had Earthly
[32:31] duties you see but he was still
[32:34] God but the thing that amazes
[32:38] me is that even though he was
[32:41] God in a in a flesh
[32:45] form even though he's the god of
[32:49] gods he's
[32:52] omnipotent he's everything right he was
[32:55] still able to come down
[32:58] and obey his Earthly
[33:01] parents you see it says in the
[33:03] Bible the first um the first commandment
[33:07] with
[33:09] promise is to obey your
[33:12] parents father and
[33:15] mother you see and we see that Jesus was
[33:18] doing
[33:20] that I want to read John
[33:25] 8:29
[33:28] and it
[33:29] says and he that sent me is with
[33:33] me the father hath not left me
[33:38] alone for I do
[33:42] always you see it says for I do
[33:46] always those things that please
[33:49] him that word
[33:52] always really amazes
[33:55] me it doesn't say
[33:58] sometimes but it says
[34:00] always always those things that please
[34:04] him Jesus always did what pleased his
[34:08] father he never once
[34:12] question never once
[34:14] complained like a lot of the times we do
[34:17] right you know I'm going to put
[34:21] myself I can't speak for any other
[34:24] youth see sometimes my parents parents
[34:27] ask me to do
[34:29] something I want to complain about it
[34:32] and I Gran and
[34:34] moan I get
[34:37] upset I don't want to do it I want to do
[34:40] it at my
[34:41] time you see but Jesus we see
[34:44] here he never questioned
[34:47] anything he never said I'll do it
[34:50] later he never said on my
[34:53] time he said no I'll always do it
[34:57] and he went with Mary White when she
[34:59] when they found
[35:02] them you see this attitude of
[35:06] obedience was forged into him even as a
[35:09] young
[35:10] man it was seared into him at age 12 to
[35:17] 13 you
[35:18] see being 12 or
[35:22] 13 I remember I mean I don't remember
[35:25] completely I know I wasn't completely
[35:29] obedient I had my
[35:32] struggles um you know I didn't I was a
[35:35] gamer back
[35:37] then even though my mom didn't let me
[35:40] get on too
[35:43] much but I remember she would put a time
[35:47] limit she would put like 30
[35:50] minutes and in my mind I didn't think 30
[35:52] minutes was
[35:55] enough it was enough for me to play
[35:57] enough what I wanted to
[36:00] play and then she jumped it up to an
[36:03] hour it still wasn't enough for
[36:06] me it was never enough for
[36:09] me you see that's just a little
[36:12] example but
[36:15] Jesus you see what amazes
[36:20] me is that he wasn't playing with the
[36:25] kids he playing video games no they
[36:29] didn't probably have video games back
[36:30] then they wasn't playing games with the
[36:36] kids he wasn't in the corner
[36:39] crying he wasn't
[36:42] afraid but he was in his father's
[36:46] business you see I imagine
[36:49] him let's bring it to this
[36:52] day let's imagine Jesus here in this
[36:55] Temple you see with our
[36:58] pastor with the ministers my
[37:01] dad Marshal all the ministers
[37:04] here of great
[37:08] knowledge here in the temple with all
[37:10] the
[37:12] brothers talking about the
[37:15] word of great
[37:17] knowledge not only not only um not only
[37:22] um asking
[37:25] questions
[37:27] but we see that it also says
[37:31] answering as such a young
[37:35] age you see I believe in this uh day
[37:40] now believe if some of the you know
[37:42] people walked in
[37:45] here and see such a young
[37:48] kid wanting to go to
[37:51] church you know other kids coming in
[37:53] they might have laughed at
[37:55] them
[37:58] I don't think they would have been like
[38:00] oh let's go join
[38:03] them let's go talk about the
[38:05] word now I believe that a lot of kids
[38:08] especially
[38:10] youth they would have been in their own
[38:12] thing going to
[38:14] [Music]
[38:16] parties
[38:17] games going
[38:20] out but not with the word of
[38:24] God but Jesus was obedient
[38:29] and staying in his father's
[38:33] business you see and that word
[38:38] always um or excuse me I wanted what I
[38:43] wanted to
[38:45] say uh Jesus chose to be
[38:49] obedient in Hebrews 57 or in Hebrews
[38:53] chapter
[38:54] 5 verse 7-9
[38:58] it says Christ in the days of his
[39:01] flesh when he had offered up prayers and
[39:04] supplications with strong crying and
[39:06] tears unto him that was able to serve
[39:08] him from death and was heard in that he
[39:20] feared it says though he were a son yet
[39:23] learned he obedience by the things which
[39:27] he
[39:33] suffered it says and being made perfect
[39:36] he became the author of Eternal
[39:37] salvation unto all those who obey
[39:45] him you see we look at the passage
[39:50] here while Jesus certainly
[39:54] prayed it says with the loud
[39:57] cry and
[39:59] tears it wasn't just a prayer a regular
[40:03] prayer and the garden
[40:07] of
[40:10] Sesame and I'm convinced that wasn't the
[40:13] only time he he
[40:16] suffered I believe he suffered more than
[40:20] once I'm sure as a young
[40:24] boy Jesus suffered because he
[40:28] obeyed you see he suffered because he
[40:30] was with Joseph and
[40:34] Mary and because he chose to
[40:38] obey he obeyed his
[40:41] father instead of following the
[40:44] crowd I'm I'm sure he was
[40:48] tormented he was laughed
[40:51] at you see maybe even by his own
[40:55] Brothers you see they were a big
[40:58] family and I mean you see a lot of times
[41:02] how would we
[41:04] feel you know if we have
[41:07] siblings if you seen your
[41:10] sibling and he was just the perfect man
[41:14] the perfect
[41:17] sibling never did anything
[41:20] wrong
[41:22] oby I bet his older brothers would have
[41:24] got
[41:25] jealous
[41:28] you see even just being at
[41:31] church we see someone doing
[41:34] good and we get
[41:37] jealous but why not start doing
[41:40] it why not start
[41:43] obeying Why not start following in those
[41:47] footsteps we get
[41:48] upset because someone is leading the
[41:53] way someone is giving us an example
[41:57] and we get jealous because they're doing
[41:58] the right
[42:01] thing it's funny
[42:04] sometimes because then when they're not
[42:06] doing the wrong thing the right
[42:09] thing we start to talk about them
[42:13] even so which one are we going to
[42:16] choose are we going to support them in
[42:18] the
[42:19] good are we going to support them or
[42:21] just laugh at them when they're doing
[42:24] bad um I want to read a
[42:29] quote in the
[42:32] [Music]
[42:33] message the Lan Church
[42:39] age
[42:41] um in paragraph
[42:45] 108 it says in his own personal life
[42:48] contending with himself he overcame by
[42:51] obedience to the word of
[42:55] God
[42:59] and then he reads Hebrews Hebrews
[43:03] 57-8 which we read uh
[43:07] earlier uh and then he
[43:10] says what was he obedient
[43:14] to the word of
[43:17] God you see Jesus was obedient to the
[43:20] word of
[43:23] God that's why he was blessed
[43:27] that's why he had what he
[43:29] had a lot of the times we want to be
[43:31] blessed
[43:32] right but we can't even be
[43:35] obedient and a lot of times you know I
[43:38] heard something earlier
[43:40] today a lot
[43:42] um a preacher was
[43:46] saying um a lot of the times we think
[43:48] obedience
[43:50] is you know as a
[43:52] preacher a young preacher or
[43:55] anything is listening to 100
[43:59] sermons having all these
[44:02] messages all these notes in your b or in
[44:04] your
[44:06] Bible IP but that's not what obedience
[44:10] is that doesn't show
[44:12] anything but your the thing that's going
[44:14] to show your
[44:17] obedience the way you
[44:19] live your
[44:21] fruits that you
[44:24] produce when you're alone
[44:27] with that door
[44:28] closed what are you really
[44:31] doing when you're around your
[44:34] friends you see cuz even here in the
[44:38] church we're not perfect
[44:40] amen but really what are you putting as
[44:43] your
[44:45] priority are you putting God
[44:47] first are you putting the things of this
[44:52] world so just because you know the the
[44:55] word
[44:58] God would rather you be
[45:00] obedient than you know the whole
[45:03] word bible the whole
[45:06] message amen amen I want to read another
[45:11] quote of our brother
[45:15] brandham um God's only provided place of
[45:19] worship says now the word Deuteronomy
[45:22] the word
[45:24] itself
[45:26] means two
[45:29] laws the word de
[45:32] Deuteronomy and and God has two
[45:36] laws the two laws one of them is
[45:39] disobedient to the
[45:42] word and
[45:44] die and the other one is obedience to
[45:47] the
[45:48] word and
[45:50] live that's the two
[45:53] laws and Deuteronomy means those two
[45:57] laws they have both been absolutely
[46:00] displayed to us in the
[46:04] scripture one of them is
[46:07] death and the other is life life and
[46:11] death God Deals Only in
[46:15] life Satan only in
[46:18] death and these were was display to the
[46:22] word publicly
[46:24] publicly
[46:27] openly before every
[46:30] eye and there is no excuse for
[46:34] it one of them was displayed on the
[46:36] Mount
[46:39] Si when the law was
[46:42] given which condemned the whole human
[46:44] race to
[46:46] death the other one was given on Mount
[46:50] Calvary that brought the whole Human
[46:53] Race To
[46:54] Life when the penalty was paid in Jesus
[47:00] Christ you see we could choose
[47:03] obedience which is going to give us
[47:05] life or we could choose
[47:09] Disobedience to be disobedient which is
[47:11] going to bring us
[47:13] death amen
[47:16] amen and you
[47:18] [Music]
[47:21] see
[47:24] um
[47:26] Jesus
[47:27] Christ the son of God he was still a
[47:31] human
[47:34] being and it amazes me because he was
[47:36] subject to
[47:39] a a
[47:42] carpenter and his
[47:45] wife and if the Lord was obedient to a
[47:48] carpenter and his
[47:52] wife what makes us any
[47:54] better what makes us any better to
[47:57] disrespect our Heavenly our Earthly
[48:02] fathers we should have that
[48:05] respect to our
[48:07] parents young or
[48:10] old um you know I remember this kid in
[48:14] my soccer
[48:18] team uh being at a away game one
[48:21] [Music]
[48:23] day I was I was astonished the way he
[48:26] treated his wife I mean his his mother
[48:27] excuse
[48:30] me if I would have ever spoke to my mom
[48:33] like
[48:35] that I know I would have been smacked
[48:39] around I remember he was cussing at his
[48:44] mom left and
[48:46] right and I remember just standing
[48:50] there I was just hearing
[48:53] them and I was just thinking
[48:57] how can a young man this or be
[49:01] so um how do I say
[49:04] it disobedient I
[49:07] guess have those type of words that come
[49:10] out of his
[49:13] mouth and tell them to his
[49:17] mother I couldn't
[49:20] imagine myself telling those to my
[49:24] mother
[49:26] or even seeing you know our
[49:30] pastor my father not even one speaking
[49:33] to another person like that that's how
[49:35] bad this
[49:39] was imagine
[49:42] Jesus if he was disobedient in those
[49:46] ways imagine if he didn't
[49:49] care imagine if Jesus was
[49:53] disobedient put yourself in Jesus's
[49:58] shoes have you been
[50:01] obedient if Jesus was in your
[50:05] [Music]
[50:07] body because that was God's son
[50:10] right but he still knew all
[50:13] things but put yourself in Jesus's
[50:18] body imagine if I was
[50:22] Jesus what would people think about me
[50:26] the way I
[50:27] live the way I portray
[50:32] myself now put your name
[50:35] there you see because we represent Jesus
[50:38] every
[50:40] day you don't have to repes you don't
[50:42] have to be Jesus to represent
[50:45] him I just want to really have you guys
[50:48] think about it a little
[50:51] more and you guys go home with a little
[50:54] thought
[50:56] if you guys were
[50:59] Jesus and I'm going to leave you guys
[51:01] with this if my brother could come
[51:05] up if you guys were
[51:07] Jesus what would you guys portray to
[51:09] this
[51:12] world but they find you you know I know
[51:15] we're not going to be
[51:17] perfect but you could tell from a person
[51:19] that's
[51:22] trying to a person that doesn't care at
[51:24] all
[51:27] would they see that you're
[51:30] obedient or would they see that you
[51:32] don't care and just want to be
[51:34] disobedient in your own
[51:39] ways think about
[51:42] that and just reanalyze your life go
[51:45] through your
[51:47] closet talking
[51:50] spiritually go through your
[51:53] room go through the places that you
[51:55] don't don't want God to to go
[52:00] through or that you're not letting them
[52:04] in and just analyze
[52:07] yourself God bless

[59:23] Al say it because he's a p he surprised
[59:27] me because he
[59:31] prepared he was led by the Holy Spirit
[59:35] now the Lord Jesus
[59:36] Christ at an early
[59:41] age he was in the
[59:45] temple this young
[59:49] man was
[59:51] with
[59:53] teachers
[59:55] speaking about the
[59:59] word nowden a young
[1:00:02] man he was the
[1:00:05] same about God's word and
[1:00:08] look he was
[1:00:10] explaining that at 12
[1:00:20] years3 when they were
[1:00:23] transitioning
[1:00:25] to be an
[1:00:28] adult so that's when they would take a
[1:00:31] responsibility of
[1:00:33] maturity yes
[1:00:35] brother and what is
[1:00:38] maturity take God's word seriously
[1:00:43] yes speaks about your
[1:00:46] behavior speaks about who you are who
[1:00:49] are
[1:00:50] you you are not children you are not
[1:00:56] and you should not behave like a bab no
[1:00:59] brother because if God is with
[1:01:03] you and if God is with
[1:01:07] you maturity should happen in your
[1:01:12] life mat should
[1:01:16] happen in your life where you take God's
[1:01:18] word
[1:01:19] seriously and God is
[1:01:22] forced to support
[1:01:25] his word yes
[1:01:28] youth I respect
[1:01:32] all I see them like any child I see
[1:01:38] them God is dealing with

[1:01:52] man if there's a need to pray for
[1:01:57] I know God will
[1:01:58] hear and I have no
[1:02:01] problem asking
[1:02:03] any pray for any person why because I
[1:02:08] believe that God is in his
[1:02:11] children God is in
[1:02:14] you see that in yourself you
[1:02:21] yes
[1:02:23] look
[1:02:25] what does obedience in the
[1:02:32] mean goes beyond receiving and
[1:02:34] fulfilling
[1:02:38] orders it's more about a
[1:02:42] volunteering
[1:02:44] acception
[1:02:47] joyful responsible of God's
[1:02:52] Will and of the Authority by legitimate
[1:02:57] right he has Upon
[1:03:00] Us obey with
[1:03:03] this shows spiritual
[1:03:07] maturity many times we think
[1:03:12] obedience oh I need to do
[1:03:16] it let's change
[1:03:20] that that shows spiritual
[1:03:23] maturity and
[1:03:27] you
[1:03:29] love
[1:03:31] you because you love
[1:03:34] God because you love God
[1:03:37] I I don't want to serve
[1:03:40] God for an
[1:03:42] obligation or because I need to
[1:03:45] do or because I don't have
[1:03:48] another or because I'm already here
[1:03:51] no I want to obey God
[1:03:54] because I
[1:04:01] love how
[1:04:03] I if not I'll
[1:04:09] because that's our lord Jesus taught
[1:04:12] us the age of
[1:04:15] 12 he was obedient look
[1:04:20] youth we see our own
[1:04:23] life we've gone through many things
[1:04:26] we've been
[1:04:28] hurt by our own parents

[1:04:33] because we make
[1:04:36] mistakes but God uses
[1:04:42] everything who love
[1:04:46] God
[1:04:47] Jesus
[1:04:49] growing
[1:04:53] imag he had a difficult
[1:04:56] life he had a life of

[1:31:42] amen we're happy with
[1:31:49] God I believe we can all say
[1:31:56] we can all learn more about
[1:31:59] obedience we can all be more
[1:32:05] obedient especially to our
[1:32:10] God how God humbled
[1:32:14] himself when they
[1:32:17] created Mary and
[1:32:20] Joseph
[1:32:22] he subjected himself to his own
[1:32:26] creation he was the he was their
[1:32:29] creator he was their
[1:32:32] father but he
[1:32:38] said like he told John the
[1:32:41] Baptist we must fulfill all
[1:32:47] scripture he wanted to give us an
[1:32:50] example
[1:32:53] if he could H humble himself to such a
[1:32:57] point who are
[1:32:59] we to not humble ourselves and say
[1:33:04] Lord I can be more
[1:33:07] obedient I can do your will amen
[1:33:11] amen we're going to be dis being
[1:33:14] dismissed we have a few
[1:33:16] announcements
[1:33:20] um
[1:33:22] greetings to all those who watch us
[1:33:23] through the inter may God bless
[1:33:28] them also if we have if you have a a
[1:33:31] letter A Prayer
[1:33:34] letter if you could return it to the
[1:33:38] person uh by which you have been or for
[1:33:41] which you have been praying
[1:33:43] for this Sunday on the
[1:33:46] 21st the last day of the
[1:33:49] fast some are perhaps anxiously uh
[1:33:54] waiting I have enjoyed it uh so
[1:33:58] much just be able to spend time with
[1:34:01] God and we will be finishing
[1:34:04] it in a very special
[1:34:07] way taking a
[1:34:10] communion and doing the washing of the
[1:34:16] feet I believe it's something we should
[1:34:18] take seriously
[1:34:20] uh
[1:34:23] just taking
[1:34:27] it not doing it without making things
[1:34:31] right with the person we may have to get
[1:34:34] right
[1:34:35] with with God above
[1:34:39] all but it's also a serious matter to
[1:34:41] not take
[1:34:43] it because it is a sin to not take it as
[1:34:48] well because it's one of the
[1:34:50] Commandments that that has been given
[1:34:52] unto
[1:34:54] us so when there is an opportunity to
[1:34:57] take
[1:34:59] it we should do all things
[1:35:01] possible partake
[1:35:06] it because in
[1:35:08] that we're
[1:35:11] honoring what Jesus did for
[1:35:14] us he said to bring it to
[1:35:18] remember to
[1:35:20] to to
[1:35:23] it and he got together with his
[1:35:27] disciples before giving his life for
[1:35:33] us and I believe it's it's beautiful for
[1:35:36] us to
[1:35:37] gather the family that God has given
[1:35:41] us and partake of the
[1:35:45] communion I know there's some that have
[1:35:48] gone
[1:35:50] out
[1:35:55] I'm not 100% certain for all the ones
[1:35:57] that that went
[1:36:00] out but there should be a desire to take
[1:36:03] partake of the
[1:36:06] communion and take advantage of these
[1:36:09] times the ones that are
[1:36:13] here maybe it's not going to be a whole
[1:36:16] lot but it'll just make it that much
[1:36:19] more
[1:36:20] intimate
[1:36:22] and
[1:36:25] special to partake of that with the
[1:36:29] Lord and with one another as
[1:36:31] well so that God would help
[1:36:35] us because we need so much
[1:36:38] [Music]
[1:36:39] help this world gets diff more difficult
[1:36:42] every
[1:36:43] time and we need more of God's
[1:36:47] help brother BR put it this
[1:36:50] way see we've gotten to the
[1:36:57] point where we simply won't be able to
[1:36:59] make it unless we help one
[1:37:01] another we just simply won't make
[1:37:06] it he said we need each other now more
[1:37:09] than
[1:37:11] ever he says it in the message
[1:37:14] thirst we need one
[1:37:17] another I need
[1:37:20] you we need each other amen
[1:37:25] amen that's what the communion is about
[1:37:31] uh I want to let you
[1:37:38] know that Sunday will be the last day I
[1:37:40] I'll be seeing
[1:37:43] you until I return from
