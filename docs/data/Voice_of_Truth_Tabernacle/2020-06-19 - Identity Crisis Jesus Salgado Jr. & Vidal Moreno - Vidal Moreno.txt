in christ he is a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new the mono question um before i continue i want to thank my pastor roberto is um what type of life am i living am i am i good with the life that i'm living am i happy for who i am because many times we are living two types of lives are living a life in church and then we we come out and do things we are not supposed to do us do things that we shouldn't be doing as that we cannot um there's something that that's i believe that who am i is a personal [Music] and check our lives through the bible who who are we when we are fulfilling all of god's word when we are in god's past when we are doing when we are obeying all of the words because many people only see what we are um outside but i believe that we know uh the things that we battle with and that we should know who who uh who we actually are um if you co-open your bibles to luke chapter 18 verse 18. verse and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i do to her eternal life do not commit adultery do not kill do not still do not bear false testimony do not fail what false witness honor thy father and thy mother no matters and he said all these things have i kept from my youth up now when jesus heard these things he said unto him lakis do one thing sell all that lou has and distribute unto the poor and do shall have treasure in heaven and come follow me jesus and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich anton says this certain ruler este he was looking for something that the things of this world could not give foreign he was looking for something that um that the material things cannot get him something that he couldn't buy material he had a hole in deep down in the soul or yeah i could imagine him being looking around him and saying what's missing and sometimes we are looking for the same things he we get trapped in the things that the world has for us um and he said he that will come to me i will no wise cast him out no matter what your back life has been i like this a lot because it shows us and that's why we are here right now yes no it doesn't matter what we've done in our past lives because as the bible says when we are in christ we are now a new creature and christos we are somebody new zomos has passed away but there has to be a certain point where where where we say i'm gonna and now it becomes a memory and we see how god has protected us from so many different things [Music] uh um take a step forward it would make us continue on but sometimes our past are speaking to us our past tells us remember when you used to do all these things remember when you used to uh um be with your friends remember when you used to be doing burst of weight something new to [Applause] god this uh this evening and that's not no chair um let us pray before we start you look it says when jesus came into the coast of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am cuando yo jesus pregnant and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others uh jeremiah's or one of the prophets juan and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him um like i said for a title uh we titled it uh identity crisis uh those of you that read the message you know i just i can't he says it so many times he says you know when the church finds out who they [Applause] [Applause] let the fundamentalists let them people who deny the power of god say it's wrong but that same power that spoke the world into existence it's time that we found out who you are the devil's trying to hide you back they tell you what you're some little tried down something you said you're not you said no [Applause] i believe yo that we're living in a time that where we just where where people just don't know who they are in the world they don't know who they are you know that that's why we have so much you know we have so much going on around the world you know i'll go ahead and say they don't they don't not only do they not know who they are but they don't know what they are i don't know something you know it is true yes like you know what one day oh you can see uh uh you know uh you think he's a man who said amen amen we're we're gonna we're gonna just uh just look into some definitions here what is identity que s identi the you see what happens is brothers when when we think of identity that oh we just we think of of what we have on us of the claws that we wear [Applause] there's something greater behind the clothes that you have you know and your child may not know who he is you know i don't blame that on anybody else but the parents it's the parent's job to let his child you are a daughter it's just an identity crisis amen amen and you know the word crisis you know i'm just going to read the definition it's is any event it's called event and that's the crisis that that that this world is in yes it's like that's the crisis that approaches peter assassinated he knew exactly who he was he wasn't going to ask the question if he didn't know who he was and that's how we act many times you see we ask and it should [Applause] you might have about 40 or 50 uh you know of dresses in the closets and then you then you you're telling somebody that you don't know you don't have anything to wear to the women that that's a crisis a amen i i remember when i first started church oh you know i i was you know i was pretty pumped up you know you know your first love supreme and you know i'll put my tie on for the first time yeah i looked in the mirror you know it's time to win souls you know and i looked in the mirror how he could just use somebody that looks a certain way he may not look very good to the people but you know what god's gonna do something you may not look he's going to no matter how you've they won't tell you who you see what we really you know should be doing okay you know as sons and daughters of god is not thinking your identity outside [Applause] they're not even telling you know the good stuff the good vacations are happening you may not want to accept it but it's the truth they're lying why don't they show you the bad stuff it's just like hollywood escomo hollywood they're just showing you the good things but inside a man a man so many times you know it's just so hard to to you know just kind of break break the surface yes okay you know what just this this is our surface esta is no extra superficial we we just don't we don't want to go in there oh you know honestly honestly we have the nemos you know have you guys ever seen uh you know they have issues oh and you know and when you they don't invite nobody over if you watch the show they don't invite anybody to their house you got we don't know who we are amen amen but when we get brothers to the foundation you know we just have to see what it is what is the foundation that we're building on estamos um oh as well chambers said these words oswald chambers he said you know many times you know as as christians you see we begin to build uh the foundation you know in we see the foundation when there's a construction going on first right over that you know about but little by little you know that foundation begins to disappear you know what foundation are you building on amen amen if we go to uh to uh john chapter four you know i want to speak a little bit about the samaritan woman it says now jacob's well was there yes to draw of samaria unto him how is it to tell the that thou being a jew judeo ask us a drink of me which i'm a woman of samaria the jews who it is [Applause] she her fame was was not good he says on verse 15. we'll go from verse 15. it says the woman said unto him sir give me this water senor that i thirst it says neither come come hither to draw jesus said unto her jesus uh go call my husband and come hither even but the woman answered and said i have no husband no tango married jesus said unto her thou hast wealth yes he says he says that has well said i have i have no i have no husband for thou has had five husbands how how how shallow things can be come home you know because jesus he doesn't he he goes he wants to go deeper with it he wants to go further than just than just the she wanted to be loved by someone yes and the reason that she wanted it that she went out and she wanted to find love outside of her home that's the way the world is that you know we just especially as youth especially you know uh i i can just i just see it you know and i i've been there myself uh i mean i'm not telling you something that i haven't lived oh you know we we try so many things in this life because we're trying to find out who we are so you know you get offered a certain thing and and you know the devil comes you know what and he just begins he begins to you know just just kind of poke at you you know i just thought you you need to try different things you know your life is just so lame oh you know why don't you try this oh you know why don't you why don't why don't you uh try and try these drugs why don't you just you know why don't you just try you just you know getting a better career you need to do something like your life is just so boring you know just try different things maybe you'll feel like that's that's who you are maybe that's how this young lady was established but you know she was just confused i'm trying to find her identity i'm trying to find love trying to find love in a man you know trying to find love in a woman you know but we find out we find out that this that this american woman is of church we'll see how things go for you because that's what this young lady did she didn't do things right now maybe she didn't have the right guidance not only did she fail just once but she failed after her first relationship and then you know it just
