[18:53] I had already had
[18:56] already
[19:02] um
[19:22] Uno
[19:27] is
[19:31] California Oklahoma
[19:50] is
[19:54] guided me that way to speak a little bit
[19:56] more on him
[20:03] see this is c and a number of one sync
[20:06] oh no salvation
[20:24] [Music]
[20:27] Syria was a great man with his master in
[20:30] honorable because by him the Lord had
[20:31] given Deliverance unto Syria he was also
[20:33] my men in battle
[20:37] that's pretty Brothers
[21:12] is
[21:23] internet
[21:25] Gloria
[21:29] is great
[21:33] he was a great man
[21:36] is
[21:42] that because the Lord
[21:47] I'm going to read it once again Brothers
[21:52] because
[21:58] Brothers
[22:00] when you read a little further
[22:05] you begin to see that he didn't see it
[22:07] that way
[22:19] he had Brothers
[22:22] a great man
[22:25] Aaron
[22:27] General a great name and he was a very
[22:31] well-known General
[22:36] he was just an instrument
[22:41] we're just instruments many times
[22:43] Brothers
[22:52] because God had raised them up and it
[22:54] was nothing that he did
[22:56] and that's how many times that's how we
[22:58] are many times
[23:02] we've been able to see someone
[23:06] who says you know what I'm a lawyer I'm
[23:09] a lawyer I have my daughter I am an
[23:13] engineer
[23:15] I'm a great mechanic
[23:18] or they could say I'm a great Builder
[23:20] construction worker great painter
[23:23] but we owe that all to God
[23:26] sometimes we just give ourselves
[23:30] I know this because my father told it to
[23:32] me
[23:34] um
[23:37] because
[23:39] God has given it to us
[24:01] and God allowed that
[24:11] our god of Glory
[24:13] Gloria glory to God
[24:17] but here Brothers
[24:20] he was very brave and already done
[24:27] a great problem
[24:29] and it's that he was a leper
[24:34] leprosy that
[25:32] and the syrians had gone out by
[25:34] companies in Broadway captive of the
[25:36] land of Israel a little maid and she
[25:38] waited on naaman's wife
[25:47] and she said unto her misses would God
[25:49] my Lord were with the prophet that is in
[25:52] Samaria for he would recover for he
[25:54] would recover him on his leprosy and
[25:57] we're seeing here Brothers
[26:05] he understood who the Lord was
[26:10] that young lady what was it there when I
[26:13] began to read here
[26:21] wasn't she like a slave
[26:46] foreign
[28:17] the Holy Spirit ought to dwell on us
[29:13] was serving mucho
[29:24] and I I see it this way Brothers he got
[29:28] his service
[29:29] he got his Muse
[29:43] Hermano
[29:45] the city this is at first he got um he
[29:48] went to the king of Syria
[29:51] Israel we're the king of Israel
[29:56] he went to the king of Syria
[29:59] but he's told him to go on so that he
[30:02] could get healed
[30:04] the king of Israel says
[30:12] I'm not reading this just so we can go
[30:14] on a little further go a little faster
[30:17] he says in my God that I could heal you
[30:22] from God so God was hearing yeah
[30:38] and he says
[30:40] but he Brothers
[30:48] [Music]
[31:00] many times Brothers
[31:04] we go and ask for counselor advice from
[31:07] my brother yes
[31:11] I'm gonna ask him for advice
[31:15] but because he doesn't give us the
[31:17] advice that we want to hear oh that
[31:19] wasn't of God
[31:26] foreign
[32:26] he's the one that provides the private
[32:28] way of God
[32:32] your name and left we know that he went
[32:34] angry
[32:37] because it didn't happen the way he
[32:39] wanted it to yeah
[32:43] I still have my notes Here on paper I
[32:47] haven't learned how to use the tablets
[32:49] I didn't even read anything Brothers
[32:51] glory to God
[32:55] many times Brothers
[33:01] leprosy hits harder
[33:03] when it's the leprosy of the Soul
[33:08] I think that there are many people here
[33:12] that are with that leprosy
[33:21] in the world
[33:24] I like to drink a lot
[33:29] but the word says that all that the man
[33:31] shall so so that that shall he read
[33:35] and I struggled very much with a
[33:53] worshiping God
[33:57] on Fridays instead of going to church
[34:02] I would go with my friends waiting for
[34:04] the day of tomorrow to see what dance
[34:05] club we're going to go to or what bars
[34:07] and on Sundays we would get up
[34:10] instead of going to church
[34:16] and we'd be hungover we'll be hungover
[34:20] but now by the glory of God God is
[34:23] taking that leprosy away
[34:28] he doesn't do things halfway tonight
[34:44] glory to God
[34:47] blessed be the name of the Lord
[34:51] glory to God
[34:57] today in the morning
[35:02] I was studying a little bit
[35:05] and I began to read a few messages
[35:10] I was watching videos
[35:15] of the how the churches are now in days
[35:26] the message of the our brothers
[35:30] because Brothers
[35:32] we're very close
[35:36] we're right on the edge
[35:39] because
[35:41] you're not criticizing anyone
[35:45] there are churches where they're of rock
[35:48] and roll
[35:50] they're dressed as rock and roll people
[35:55] that all this would be seen
[35:58] every time
[36:10] even thanks to God for the trials that
[36:12] he gives us right because that all the
[36:14] words
[36:21] their brothers
[36:25] why was he there as a leper with lepersy
[36:36] in Israel who understands and heals
[36:43] who was blind
[36:47] and that the disciples asked Jesus
[36:51] who sinned he or his parents and what do
[36:54] you say neither of them
[36:56] and then so then why is he there to
[37:00] manifest my power he says
[37:08] glory to God for that
[37:11] perhaps to manifest the power of God
[37:14] glory to God
[37:19] bless you
[37:22] thank you
[37:24] [Applause]
[37:30] amen
[37:31] God bless you
[37:33] if you would just open your Bibles
[37:35] foreign
[37:52] uh
[37:54] if you would please stand with me
[38:00] like this
[38:02] he says
[38:05] Rivers the Damascus better than all the
[38:08] Waters of Israel
[38:09] may I not wash in them and be clean so
[38:12] he turned and went away in a rage
[38:15] Israel
[38:23] limpio
[38:27] is
[38:30] and the servants came near and spake
[38:32] unto him it said my father if the
[38:35] prophet had bid they do some great thing
[38:37] will this thou not have done it how much
[38:39] rather than when he said to thee wash
[38:41] and be clean masos
[38:48] limpio
[38:58] then when he down verse 14 then when he
[39:02] down and dipped himself seven times in
[39:05] Jordan according to the saying of the
[39:07] man of God and his flesh came again like
[39:10] unto the Flesh of a little child and he
[39:12] was clean
[39:14] says
[39:28] like that first part it says then he
[39:31] went down
[39:39] and we'll be reading Philippians chapter
[39:42] 2 verse 7.
[39:46] just a few readings to the scripture
[39:49] here
[39:50] see
[39:52] uh
[39:53] Philippians 2 verse 7.
[39:57] says but made himself of no reputation
[40:01] and took upon him the form of a servant
[40:03] and was made in the likeness of men yeah
[40:18] if I uh with the title it you're you
[40:21] know for as a thought
[40:23] you know I think I'd try to let you know
[40:25] along with poor brother uh Hector said
[40:32] uh he'll he'll be there
[40:35] amen amen uh you know uh like brother
[40:40] Hector was saying
[40:42] that Naaman was a man of uh of a great
[40:46] reputation
[40:48] reputation you know he really wanted to
[40:51] be uh you know he it's like anybody
[40:56] you know he wanted to be accepted
[40:59] you know by society
[41:03] and uh and so you know he he didn't want
[41:07] to exactly uh ruin the reputation that
[41:10] he thought he had yellow
[41:12] reputation
[41:14] amen my man uh you know because some
[41:17] people you know they they really think
[41:20] highly of themselves
[41:25] and uh you know they just want to you
[41:28] know act a certain way
[41:30] you know I dress a certain way
[41:33] you know you want to get those likes
[41:36] let's go uh
[41:51] you know you want to get them followers
[41:54] uh you know but uh you know I I read a
[41:58] quote one time
[42:02] and uh you know uh before we uh before
[42:06] we can leave we have to learn how to
[42:07] follow
[42:10] before we can lead
[42:16] yeah and you know but we have to watch
[42:19] who we're following it
[42:22] you know there's just so much confusion
[42:25] in this time
[42:27] and uh you know I was I'll show my
[42:29] daughter here not that long ago
[42:32] matter of fact it was yesterday okay
[42:34] foreign
[42:46] a lot of times we're influenced you know
[42:49] by by external things
[42:53] you know thinking that that's the right
[42:55] thing to do
[42:56] correct you know I'm a perfect example
[43:01] Perfecto if I didn't have long sleeves
[43:05] you know you you'd be able to see that I
[43:08] you know I have tattoos
[43:11] you know that at the time that was that
[43:13] was what uh you know I thought was the
[43:15] right thing
[43:17] so I completely understand you know when
[43:20] other people do things that they
[43:22] shouldn't doses
[43:27] because they they feel like that's right
[43:33] they feel like that's going to satisfy
[43:35] you know their their their hunger
[43:42] you know this guy was talking about you
[43:44] know uh you know the the frogs you know
[43:47] in in the Amazon forest is
[43:53] and uh you know the thing of it is it's
[43:56] uh it's it's you know there's certain
[44:01] ones that you really have to watch out
[44:02] for
[44:05] and uh and you just got to be real
[44:07] careful
[44:09] uh you know because uh there's they
[44:13] actually stand out from the rest
[44:17] you know and there's just certain
[44:19] there's certain things about them that
[44:21] you can tell
[44:25] you know the there's just something
[44:27] different about about that animal
[44:31] you know it's it's uh it's the the
[44:33] fluorescent colors
[44:37] no whether it be a Una
[44:45] [Music]
[44:54] you know the the rock and roll era has
[44:57] come into you know the the church
[45:04] and you know it and we know it's not
[45:06] right
[45:07] you know and so they think that you know
[45:10] they those those fluorescent colors
[45:14] you know they think that you know by by
[45:16] wearing that
[45:18] so you know by by uh you know listening
[45:22] to the certain type of music
[45:25] that that is it's it's just it's gonna
[45:28] make things better
[45:31] you know and it might just change their
[45:34] reputation
[45:35] it might make them stand out a little
[45:38] bit
[45:39] but you know you don't have to do those
[45:41] things to stand out
[45:45] they say that you know sometimes you
[45:47] know what's really big you know and guys
[45:49] and girls season
[45:54] is the the fluorescent thing going on
[45:57] yes
[46:03] you know and and you know it's it's one
[46:06] of those things that you know that what
[46:09] what's going on inside of them a lot of
[46:10] times
[46:13] it's it's being shown on in the external
[46:16] Realms
[46:21] you know they want they want to you know
[46:23] have have that reputation perhaps
[46:27] and you know I believe that you know
[46:29] Naaman at that time
[46:32] you know he was he was probably
[46:33] hungering for something
[46:36] you know he wanted to take care of his
[46:39] reputation
[46:41] not because you know he was a great man
[46:43] the Bible says
[46:46] among you know amongst the the uh the
[46:50] Army ranks
[46:51] [Music]
[46:54] oh but you know there was also another
[46:57] man there
[46:59] and uh you know he also you know had a
[47:03] reputation
[47:05] you know not because he wanted to have
[47:07] that
[47:26] I believe that that um you know
[47:29] Naaman didn't even know Elisha okay
[47:34] but you know that uh when when uh you're
[47:37] a servant of God
[47:40] you know your reputation it goes before
[47:42] you to reputation
[47:45] before you even get there
[47:49] you know and and people you know know
[47:52] that that you know the man of God's
[47:54] coming
[47:56] they already start to work
[48:00] you know that's that that's what Jesus
[48:03] did
[48:04] you know people found out Jesus was
[48:06] coming
[48:08] you know he he would just get there
[48:11] and he would just say come follow me yes
[48:14] and they did it because of the
[48:18] reputation you know that he had
[48:19] reputation it went ahead of him
[48:25] but you know but in this world
[48:29] this world is not it's not it doesn't
[48:31] work like that is
[48:33] you know because uh Naaman was told by
[48:36] the man of God
[48:39] what exactly he had to do is
[48:43] you know name and what name it was I
[48:46] believe Naaman was was scared
[48:49] a name it was a little bit uh you know
[48:52] he he didn't quite trust
[48:56] he didn't quite trust you know what the
[48:58] prospect was telling us
[49:01] I wonder if that's how many of us are in
[49:04] this time
[49:08] how many of us are are like that in this
[49:10] time
[49:13] well you know what we're not quite
[49:15] trusting what the prophet is saying
[49:20] you know he had a problem
[49:24] he had all he had all these great you
[49:27] know of these great titles
[49:29] yes
[50:05] that is is that that doesn't have any
[50:08] sin in their lives
[50:10] so because you know because he he
[50:14] doesn't want to go down
[50:16] to the Jordan
[50:19] you see because uh because what would
[50:22] the people say
[50:23] you know what was your friend saying
[50:26] you know if they saw you clapping in
[50:29] church
[50:30] I saw you crying
[50:36] but what would they say
[50:39] what would be of your reputation
[50:43] they saw you do those things
[50:46] if they saw you getting a new birth
[50:50] what would your friend say about that
[50:54] I believe Naaman had many of those
[50:56] worries
[50:59] because you know he was he was the he
[51:02] was the man
[51:03] we could say he was probably Top Dog
[51:07] [Applause]
[51:12] you know and they want to be tough dogs
[51:17] you know it's the truth you know anytime
[51:21] you you know
[51:25] you know in the worldly ranks
[51:30] you know you you always water you can
[51:32] always tell kind of who's the the little
[51:34] Alpha there
[51:37] sometimes it's the little guy
[51:41] you know you just kind of going in there
[51:43] man but all the everybody's following
[51:50] oh you know how to brother I actually
[51:53] have a brother
[51:54] you know that's that's how he was yeah
[51:57] CSL you know he he he he'd have his
[52:00] little Posse
[52:06] wherever he went me he had like five or
[52:09] six pieces
[52:12] that's just that's just the kind of
[52:14] person that he wants yes
[52:17] and you know just everybody wanted to be
[52:20] around
[52:21] you know and when he dropped out of
[52:24] school
[52:41] he was like 14 years old
[52:45] and uh you know and you can't really you
[52:47] can't drop out until you're 16.
[52:52] and they just said please don't come
[52:54] back
[52:55] don't press we won't press charges
[53:02] you know but just don't come back so he
[53:06] you know he just stayed home he thought
[53:08] he won he was like yeah
[53:10] no more schools
[53:12] and uh you know he just went home
[53:15] foreign
[53:25] you know it was like three or four guys
[53:27] there
[53:29] you know she was like what are you guys
[53:31] doing
[53:32] like well you know I dropped out
[53:36] so we dropped out too and Toes
[53:39] that's the kind of influence that he had
[53:42] yeah
[53:44] and you know I believe that you know
[53:49] you probably had that kind of influence
[53:54] you know he didn't want to lose that so
[53:57] you know he didn't want to lose his
[53:58] friends
[54:04] you know in your life
[54:06] where you you have to you have to uh you
[54:09] have to have that peace in your heart
[54:12] I heard a guy say one time
[54:16] he said he said you're either gonna be
[54:20] at peace with yourself
[54:43] there's going to come a time in your
[54:45] life
[54:48] you have to make a decision
[54:50] because you cannot have the peace of God
[54:54] you know and then have peace with the
[54:57] world
[54:58] because the world can't give that to you
[55:02] the world is actually gonna take that
[55:04] away
[55:07] because they want you to be with him
[55:11] and I believe that that's the point that
[55:13] Naaman had come to you
[55:16] you know he had come to a place
[55:21] where he didn't want to be a leopard
[55:24] but it was gonna tell it was gonna cost
[55:27] something
[55:28] I think he was gonna have to pay a price
[55:32] for healing he was gonna have to come
[55:36] down
[55:39] that's what every son and daughter again
[55:43] you're gonna have to come down from your
[55:46] position
[56:10] you know when you make that decision
[56:13] enough
[56:37] no
[58:11] he's gonna be there
[58:14] amen
[58:16] Glory uh you know I was uh
[58:19] I was Enrico's soccer game yesterday
[58:26] football
[58:30] and uh he did something that uh just
[58:33] kind of took me back to to my uh
[58:35] childhood uh my my teenage years
[58:40] uh you know when he when we when we got
[58:43] there
[58:46] he kind of he kind of looked back
[58:49] a little bit come on a little bit
[58:54] gracias you know just to see if we were
[58:57] there
[59:00] and uh
[59:03] you know I remember doing the same thing
[59:05] uh
[59:08] one thing that uh
[59:10] I remember
[59:13] I would uh I I I you know I I was an
[59:17] athlete
[59:18] and you know I got a lot of playing time
[59:21] and
[59:28] one of the things I always desired
[59:32] was uh for for my uh my dad to be there
[59:36] you know I would play I would play a lot
[59:40] you see because if I didn't play
[59:43] and my dad went Eva then I was gonna
[59:47] hear about it
[59:48] I made sure that I was playing
[59:51] I'm sure I was going to get every minute
[1:00:04] and you know I'd make a good play yes
[1:00:07] and I just kind of look up at the stands
[1:00:11] and uh
[1:00:13] wanted to see if my dad was there
[1:00:17] and he he never made it
[1:00:20] he never made it to the game
[1:00:23] how about what always really encouraged
[1:00:26] me
[1:00:27] I was uh my little brother
[1:00:31] you know he always had his little Posse
[1:00:33] with him Siempre
[1:00:36] ad
[1:00:38] gracias you got us
[1:00:40] he always had his posse
[1:00:43] and I would always look up to the right
[1:00:47] and you know he would he would give me
[1:00:49] the thumbs up
[1:00:51] and uh you know just bring me Comfort
[1:00:54] yes
[1:00:55] you know what bring me joy to my heart
[1:01:01] that somebody went to go watch me please
[1:01:04] you know I think in the Christian Life
[1:01:08] sometimes we think nobody's watching
[1:01:13] but that when you're trying to live for
[1:01:16] God
[1:01:18] he's going to be there but he's going to
[1:01:21] be there
[1:01:23] in my heart no I would look at him and I
[1:01:28] would just get a boost of energy
[1:01:31] and you know I will just play I was like
[1:01:34] he's the only one that came
[1:01:44] you know
[1:01:46] there may be people that may not
[1:01:48] understand me
[1:01:50] you know I'm willing to accept the
[1:01:53] reproach for the cause of the words
[1:01:57] I'm willing to accept that is willing to
[1:02:02] accept that my family's Never Gonna
[1:02:03] understand me
[1:02:07] they're not going to understand the way
[1:02:10] I live
[1:02:11] they're not going to understand my
[1:02:13] purpose
[1:02:14] they're not going to understand it
[1:02:17] they're not willing to accept them
[1:02:19] because I know somebody
[1:02:22] I know there's somebody here is gonna
[1:02:26] understand
[1:02:27] that's what I'm going through okay
[1:02:36] or peace
[1:02:39] I want the holy ghosts
[1:02:46] so
[1:02:55] you know we showed up late to the game
[1:02:57] yesterday
[1:03:03] but we made it
[1:03:06] we made it to the game
[1:03:08] you know it's better to make it late
[1:03:11] than never
[1:03:13] you might have just barely made it to
[1:03:16] church
[1:03:19] might have thought you was just gonna
[1:03:20] stay home
[1:03:22] but you made
[1:03:26] that's right brother we made it late
[1:03:28] maybe
[1:03:31] pero yagamos
[1:03:35] and uh
[1:03:37] I might have I may have made it late
[1:03:43] but God's never late
[1:03:46] he's never late
[1:03:48] he's always on time Tiempo
[1:03:53] and when I think about that
[1:03:56] there's a lot of people
[1:04:00] that we're looking for somebody
[1:04:04] they were looking for somebody
[1:04:08] they were looking for their dad
[1:04:11] they were looking for their mom they
[1:04:15] were looking for their sisters
[1:04:16] they were looking for peace
[1:04:19] they were looking for something
[1:04:24] it may have never made it so
[1:04:29] but I want to tell you
[1:04:32] that God made it
[1:04:34] God made it here
[1:04:37] and you made it here
[1:04:39] because God made it here
[1:04:42] you know you may have been forsaken
[1:04:47] you may have been disappointed
[1:04:51] you know with with the things that have
[1:04:53] happened in this life
[1:04:55] and you know you don't understand why
[1:04:58] they happened
[1:05:03] you've been looking for something
[1:05:06] you desired your whole life
[1:05:09] and you know and you may have been
[1:05:11] disappointed
[1:05:14] but I believe
[1:05:16] that when Naaman made it to the Jordan
[1:05:20] what he was looking for his whole life
[1:05:26] it was there he may not have saw he may
[1:05:30] not have saw what he's in may have seen
[1:05:32] at the other rivers
[1:05:39] he may have not saw you know some
[1:05:42] beautiful sights
[1:05:44] are there something you know pleasing to
[1:05:47] the Allah
[1:06:02] but you can find your peace
[1:06:16] you can find it in here
[1:06:27] man
[1:06:30] you may not find popularity
[1:06:35] you may not find Fame La Familia
[1:06:40] may not find a hole a lot of friends
[1:06:43] Amigos
[1:06:46] but you'll find the truth
[1:06:50] Amigo you'll find somebody that
[1:06:52] understands
[1:06:54] somebody that feels your pain
[1:06:58] maybe your mom doesn't understand
[1:07:02] your
[1:07:05] brothers or sisters
[1:07:48] you know and I believe that that's the
[1:07:50] greatest thing that that mankind is
[1:07:52] looking
[1:07:55] you may look at yourself in the mirror
[1:07:59] and say everything's fine

[1:23:50] you may be seated
[1:23:55] did you ask him to bless you
[1:23:58] you're already here
[1:24:01] I think that name is said I'm already
[1:24:03] here I've come so far
[1:24:07] why don't I just try it
[1:24:09] sometimes we come to church
[1:24:12] because it's not what we thought of it
[1:24:14] we don't even ask anything and we leave
[1:24:17] the same way
[1:24:19] when sometimes God is just waiting for
[1:24:22] us to try it
[1:24:33] why don't I ask him for the Holy Spirit
[1:24:36] maybe in a service like this when he's
[1:24:39] going to give it to me
[1:24:43] don't leave without asking them don't
[1:24:47] leave without asking
[1:24:50] I think that name and said I'm gonna try
[1:24:52] it
[1:24:54] not so convinced but I'm gonna try it
[1:24:56] anyways
[1:24:58] that's what we can do
[1:25:00] the Lord your Prophet said it I believe
[1:25:03] it and I'm going to confess it Lord
[1:25:06] amen
[1:25:08] maybe it's not the way that I want it
[1:25:12] sometimes we want emotions and a great
[1:25:15] preacher and great musicians and this
[1:25:18] and the others for everything to be
[1:25:21] beautiful
[1:25:22] but sometimes God says I want to give it
[1:25:24] to you this way
[1:25:27] you just have to believe me
[1:25:30] and ask of it anyways
[1:25:34] that's the kind of God that we serve
[1:25:37] he doesn't need great events
[1:25:40] to give us what we need of
[1:25:43] amen
[1:25:45] said well I thought that he was going to
[1:25:47] come
[1:25:52] he's going to see me
[1:25:56] he's gonna place his hands on me
[1:25:59] and that was going to be healed that way
[1:26:02] I was very disappointed
[1:26:05] even when we're disappointed God can
[1:26:07] answer us
[1:26:12] Our God only wants us to obey
[1:26:15] and for us to believe him
[1:26:17] we're going to be being dismissed
[1:26:21] this is
[1:26:35] praying for her
