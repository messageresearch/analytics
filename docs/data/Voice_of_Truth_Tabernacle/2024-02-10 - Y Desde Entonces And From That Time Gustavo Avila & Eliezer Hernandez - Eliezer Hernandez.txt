amen amen God bless you this evening can open up your scriptures with me Matthew 4 verse 17 Matthew 4 verse 17 we give thanks to our God first beloved Pastor who allows us Matthew 4:17 and it says like this and from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand tell your neighbor and from that time going to be praying in that manner beloved Heavenly Father we come before your presence I love the way your Prophet said it no one calls themselves an adult of the Lord but they're called a Son of God lord there's no one who's more or less than us we are all the same before your eyes not mattering our age father or how many years we might have you can use someone who is of an older age just as you can use someone who's a bit younger father put me aside use my brother and may it be a benefit to your bride this evening we give you thanks we put ourselves in your hands in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seats this evening with the help of the Holy Spirit and with my brother hernandz we place this title and from that time again and from that time amen amen amen we're talking about the Lord Jesus still this evening I'm we be basing a lot of my thought off of two messages our Prophet preached to us and one of them is why are the people so tossed about why are the people so tossed about and the other is and from that time I believe that they're essential messages for the and for the adults Amen to see where we're at in our daily Christian walk and I recommend them for you I probably won't be able to finish everything I have in my heart brother BR brother BR but in the message brother brandham from that time he says and he gives many examples and he speaks on this scripture I just read and he takes it in this perspective this angle where he says and from that time brother BR says that every Christian or son or daughter of God they have one of those moments that it says and from that time whether good or bad they each have that moment brother brandham gives a few examples he says as as a young lady a lady that's of ill Fame you could say and she says there was a time that I I was a morally I was a good behavior I used to go to church and I I behaved good but brother Brandon says and on one night in a certain place something bad happened and that woman might be able to say and from that time and then she she went off the path she went on to a bad path and in the same way a youth brother Brom gives another example of a youth who lies to their parents for the first time I believe that each youth can remember when they would lie to their parents brother Bram gives his example of this youth that he says brother Bram brother BR I remember I was smoking a cigarette behind my house and I was there beside my chimney and I had a a cup of coffee and I drank that cup of coffee to cover up that cigarette smell I identify with that young man and the young man says and then I found myself with my mother and my mother told me and then she said blow breathe breathe in my face she she mother says to him and he breathes in her face mother smiles and she says hey you smell like coffee she are you trying to cover up something and the young man says in me he says something in me told me to tell her the truth but the youth says says he says no Mom promise I've never smoked cigarettes brother Bram and brother brandham says and from that time but when man finds himself with god brother it is different your neighbor it's different brother because brother brandham says in that same message if you can put it up on the screen is that fine if I preach the message to you this even I know that a Perot can do my job but it's need of the inspiration it's for you to see your life in this message word help you to change your journey to where you're going and the prophet says in the message and from that time in paragraph 24 but there's a time that where a man can come to something that's Eternal that's the time that a man that's the time the man meets God now he says that's when something happens that's Eternal do you believe is there someone here that's found themselves with God this evening that they have something Eternal inside of them now we're GNA get back to that if God helps us and this message brother Bram preached he preached it on a new year service and it wasn't too long ago that we had one another brother BR says in that message we make our mistakes and we make our vows on at [Music] night to only break them the next day and this is what I want to focus on and he says and we come to the Altar and turn new pages but all in vain for the next time somebody crosses our path or something that old temper will fly right back again I like what the prophet says there but there is a place tell your neighbor there's a place there a place the prophet can come to God on an occasion for God to change his eternal destination and he says he who comes to me I will not Cast Away do you give thanks to God that you can come to God no matter in your condition but is just simply to come to him brother brother say and his entire Eternal destination is changed say once again and from that time were you here this evening did you come to have church I don't know about you but I felt something with God and all of this I'm not just doing it for a show or just to cause something to look at I give thanks to God I was able to grab a hold andain it and this has helped me to see where I'm at in my life and that's why we come to church to see where we are too much too much on the left or the right this evening Amen brother brother Brandon says and a man can meet God and he can never be the same anymore now you probably ask yourself what is that place is it's the church is it the church is it to know more is it to know more of my Bible is it to know more the message or is it to behave good act is to have good morals because I believe that every person here has genuinely tried to get closer to God but I in the same way include myself we have our highs and lows and there's nothing wrong with that it's part of the Christian life but we're going to see and we give thanks for a messenger who gives us the breath of life gives us a breath a hope something can happen in our lives something better in the message why are the people so tossed about brother brother brand speaks on two different phases and that's what I want to focus on now he says now it's two different phases it's a better uh word to use not two types but two phases brother Brandon says in this message the same Christianity but two phases of it and one of them is an intellectual brother brandom says mental conception of what God has of what God is and the other it's an experimental experience and it is there that you have your moment of and from that time and God help me to explain it now that who he who is intellectual brother he is hungering brother he is feasting on God but his peace doesn't hold out brother brandham says isn't that tremendous he enjoys of God as we all do but his Feast doesn't last so there's a difference and the other the one with the experience brother Bram says that he has Victory after Victory nothing bothers him and in this same message brother brand speaks of a boat of how it has an anchor not mattering if the storm comes and hits it it's not the the boat that remains but it's the anchor that keeps in place that doesn't move that doesn't allow for it to move or sink and that is the anchor that is your an from that time that we have to have an an us to the word of God it does matter if they hit us from the left or the right we stay centered on God Amen and brother Brown says in the message the same message why are people so tossed about he says this he asked a question Lord what is it that these people those that have the experience have that the others those that are intellectual that they they pray so much and yet they fail to receive it remember it is the same Christianity but a different phase of it God help us this see to see where we are it's not nothing wrong for the person to be intellectual but there's something that brother Brown is trying to say more than just to know your scripture more than just to know the message than any ReliOn there is a genuine experience where you obtained your and from that time brother Bram and brother brandham says he says and I know that's a great question in our hearts who has come to Christ and he continues to [Music] say and he says and many of our teachers and schools have brought in so much the theology telling people saying well it's because you didn't shout because you didn't speak with Tong now I'm going to get into this a little bit we know that we have we have that here we don't have that here but perhaps you heard a brother or a sister they gave their testimony and how they received their experience there and from that time but brother R says that God is a god of variety God doesn't work the same with everyone and I hope that doesn't confuse you but God is not going to work in the same way with my brother VI he's going to work with me it is a genuine experience a firstand experience that only I and God have Moses had his experience of firstand his first experience Paul had his experience with the light each person had their end from that time a different way there are similarities but you have to have your own your own experience your firsthand exper it can be your dad your mother telling you or your pastor preaching to you but it has to be you for you to desire and from that time with God is that your desire this evening that that this evening it it not be just another night but for you to go back in your life 10 years have gone 10 15 years to go by and by the grace of God we're still here and to be able to say in that youth service where brother gust the Holy Spirit came down that's where I my and from that time experience brother brother the brandom says with these two types he says now you have two different mental faculties all right he says you have one that's in your brain and one that's in your heart the intellectual part goes through your head and the experience goes through your heart he says now when the head begins to say something the soul wonders at it if it's not right but when it comes into the soul the head seems to step back I believe that's what we want this evening is to stop reasoning and just to believe God to believe his word he always tells us believe his word believe what God has said and yes I believe we genuinely believe but what is it that doesn't allow us to go further now I'm going to jump through a little bit because I don't have a lot of time left but now the time the question is what is it that happens in the heart that gives me my and from that time because it has to go through the heart we we know that brother BR said it it can't go through your head has to go down into your heart because that's where godes to that's where you have your encounter with God amen amen I know I might be telling you things you already know but it's good to remind ourselves brother Brown gives the example of the sister the man or the the Mana of the man that came down that was outside that brother Brown says everyone part took of it the multitudes of [Music] people and then we know that there's a Mana that's in the most holy place and and that's where it is that's where you find your end from that time remember that not everyone went in went in there everyone enjoyed of the manner that was outside and remember that the same Christianity but a different phase of it I don't know about you but I want to go going deeper it requires of more effort to go fur I give thanks to God that he tore that ve allow us to go into that most holy place the holiest of holies where we are now holiest of holies is where you are now where God finds your heart I probably won't be able to finish but go and read those messages there's no message that the prophet preached where it was in vain but I believe it was with all of his heart to be able to help the people what is it why do they always seem so happy and I'm forcing or trying my best day after day and it's like I can't understand like I can't anchor myself enough may God help us this evening brother Bram says the last the last quote the heart is the abot of God in the Old Testament God dwelt In His glory over the AR and the the heart is the AR God dwells not in the head in the heart God's not known by theology God's not known by mental conception I believe that this is god brother Bram says God's known by an old fashion Born Again experience an old fashioned Born Again experience and that sanctifies that is in the human heart so take this with you that new birth it can only go into your heart and how do I get it there brother Gustavo in your secret place when you're there kneeling with God when you undress yourself before God and you allow him to know all of your truth take out all that you have within all the ugly no one knows and that's where God wants to be to take all of that out so that you and him can have an experience and you can go back and see in your life and say and from that time I obtained my vict my victory with God God bless [Applause] you it's able to help the people brother Bram says the greatest privilege that a minister has preach the word of God that is the greatest privilege of minister to be to help the people through his word and it's the only thing we want to do brother we want to help the youth we want to help our children we want to help your children amen amen it's been a while now that I haven't spoken to the youth but I want to dedicate this message to all people all the youth who have not had their from that time who have struggled for a long time now with the same thing they have not been able to overcome certain things I want to dedicate you to this message if every single one of us have to get to that from that time on when we talk about from that time it's something that divides the present to the Past it's something that makes a big difference if you had the opportunity to go back in this this time to the to the Past and the exact moment that you made a mistake WIll you take advantage of that opportunity would take the the opportunity for God if God gave you that the opportunity to go back and pass and not make that mistake not even one of us would would not take advantage of that let me tell you this the opportunity is here now in this moment you have the opportunity to change the way of your life it's not in the hands of your pastor it's in your hands it's in my hands in the hands of every single one of us from that time we're speaking on the Lord Jesus and the greatest example a Christian has is the Lord Jesus Christ now the time was coming for the Lord Jesus Christ to have his ministry his ministry was going to begin but I go to the point where he was going to die in the calvary and I asked myself is it truly where he died at at Calvary he didn't die at Calvary where he died was in was preparation for what was coming ahead so we find Lord Jesus Christ here about to begin his ministry he already started his ministry many years behind he already started and as our youth already preached to us Jesus had a preparation Jesus had a preparation for the beginning of his ministry and the doing of Miracles and making water to wine that does not come from night to morning it has a process it has a process it has a preparation the preparation of Jesus we can see it from when he was a child since his childhood he would start to read the scriptures find him something that filled him from the scriptures he took many hours to read the scriptures speaking with his parents about the scriptures now we can be an hour and a half at church we don't even remember what the brothers preached we want to go look at our phon we want to go see our favorite series see the new movie that came out Christ Was preparing himself since he was a child he was also obedient to his parents obedience is something great obedience is something great he subjected himself to his parents like a youth preached to us he himself subjected to his creation he humbled himself to himself he was willing to obey to someone who was inferior to him think about that he obeyed to someone who was inferior to him now what is preparation the meaning of preparation is action and effect of prep preparing it says action that facilitates or reinforces the attack I'm G to repeat that it says an action that facilitates or reinforces theack if you don't prepare if you don't prepare the attack that comes to you will defeat you ourselves very defeated brothers because we can't Advance because we don't prepare ourselves that's going to war without preparation without knowing how to hold their weapon knowing how to fire their weapon knowing how to defend [Applause] themselves it's a sure death another meaning of preparation is carry out the necessary operation to obtain a product we need to prepare ourselves brothers look the child prepares since child to do something in life since child he said I want to do this of course there's many influences many things depend many things don't depend on depends on the influences but since childhood he he carries out a pattern and he says I want to be this I want to be an astronaut I want to be a pilot and he starts to prepare himself in his mind but he doesn't only leave it in his mind because things come in his life they will take him away from his objective but you know what with Jesus Christ it was not that way Jesus since child he was focused on fulfilling his purpose I'm gonna repeat that Jesus Christ since his childhood was focused fulfilling his purpose his parents forgot him they left him behind alone let our children be alone we don't know what's going to happen they left Jesus alone where did he go where did he go where his heart was where was his heart that's where he went that's where we should go the word of God you know they showed me a video this week of some of someone that I knew from my childhood I don't want to say if it's male or female but they showed me this video where they were inter interviewing them and he was in the streets he was lost in drugs and I knew him from my childhood I grew with him in the message and to see a Son of God in defeat it's the saddest thing there is this person would say in this interview they said many times we want to blame other people we blame them or this other person but what this person was saying is that truly it was their fault and we wouldn't want to see our youth is to be in a stage of defeat that would be like if that was our defeat we want to see our youth in Victory and the youth have everything to their reach to obtain the victory to come to that time that changes their life and let me tell you let me tell you that that moment will come you know human being children the devil prepares them from childhood did you know that Satan prepared something for you before you were born so that you would fail Satan is working with us since our childhood since our childhood brother bham says in in the message and from that time preaching 59 in paragraph 58 we can all find something that that began in a certain time and from then on things has changed and many of us bring things from our past that we have not been able to get rid of something that happened in the past something has changed us in the past and we want to change for a long time now and we haven't been able to brother Bram says and there's other worthy things that we could think of man with good intentions has tried to start things a new to do things at a certain time paragraph 64 all these things are there there's a time when something happens and there's there's things brothers that happen that get in the Deep of your mind if you can't get rid of them they're going to disturb you for the rest of your life you don't fix Brothers it will disturb you for the rest of your life it will disturb you wife or your husband it'll disturb your children if you don't get rid of that and maybe all their vows in all the leagues of Nations so and so forth maybe had good int but they all came to an end all became crumbling beneath the feet of man with all the good intentions we could have but all must come to an end and that's a decision brothers that you have to take I can't take that decision for you I can't take the decision for my children them and every single one of us have to take our own decisions what took the Lord Jesus Christ was his own decision since from his childood to follow in the footsteps of God you think Jesus Christ had it easy Brothers think he truly had it easy Jesus Christ did not have it easy that means we also will not have it easy it won't be easy brother but it's our own decision to change your destiny it's not in the hands of anyone I dare to say it's not even in the hands of God it's in the hands of every single one of us so when Jesus Christ came to the beginning of his ministry he had already received the Holy Spirit he had already found his experience he had come face to face with God but the preparation that he had to come to that time was what brought him to that time you have to prepare yourself to come to service you have to prepare yourself for service we want things easy Brothers want an a fairy to come out and say no no it's not like that reality is not like [Music] that Hollywood you want to live in a Hollywood movie no brothers you have to get hot it has to get hard the way has to get hard we all like to go on the highway but we don't like to go on terrain dirt roads we don't like it Brothers we have to come to that time that time will come are you prepared are you not prepared as this person said you can put the blame on all my parents divorced all my parents did not treat me well my parents don't live the [Applause] life no that same thing is in front of you it's a personal decision or They Don't Preach me well where I go to They Don't Preach me what I want I want something more elevated you have to come to the point has to come that moment that moment will come where it will make the difference and I say tonight why not today why don't you give the opportunity for it to be today brother Bram in this in this message in paragraph 50 he says this U story about this elder you imagine become older of age and be strugly with the same thing you say it won't happen to me if you don't make your decision if you don't come to that point you say have to come to this time I have to come to with my experience with God paragraph 84 there was this Elder and he could not make the decision the devil kept beating him out of it one day out in the field he nailed down to pray while he was praying he drove down a St he said let this be a memorial if you ever come to me again I'll point you to this star I'll tell you that right here I met God and it was settled from here on that's what we [Applause] need a St in a field but somewhere some secret closet some place all tonight there will be hundreds of thousands of them and next year we'll have to ttin them all over again we'll say we doing this and that we'll lay aside our temper we'll do more for God do this or that or the other only to find that it's in vain please stand Brothers are you not tired that Satan has you on the ground are you not tired that he places those same thoughts I believe it's enough I believe it's enough it's time to tell Satan Satan you have no power over me paragraph 89 but what man needs to do tonight is to come face to face with God and from then on he's a chang hallelujah hallelujah oh I wish I could tell it the way I believe it but when a man meets God he changed from that minute for the rest of his days he'll never be the same because he's got eternal life he's a new creature all things have passed away and all things have become new to him he looks new just please byow our heads father if we could come if I could come to that place my life is completely changed Lord my life is completely in you although the winds Al the strong winds come Satan may come with great Temptations I'm already hidden in [Music] you father if there's someone here tired that Satan be beating them [Music] down beating them [Music] down and fall in the same place in the same filthiness it's time to tell Satan Satan you have no power over [Music] me and Satan will not [Music] leave until we let your Holy Spirit come in he will try he will come back but there's something there there's an [Music] agent has come to the depths of our heart that has filled the most deepest part of ourselves and it doesn't matter the weapons that devil utilizes he shall not have no power over us Satan let go of the people you have nothing to do nothing to do you have no part with the children of God H children of God children of [Music] God let us accept our [Music] God let us have the experience with God face to [Music] face let us have from that [Music] time although the devil may come although the devil may [Music] come he will not be able to do anything against [Music] us because the devil is that finds himself face to face Satan you are defeated Satan you are defeated right children of God accept your Victory Satan you are defeated thank you Father thank you Lord only in you we have the [Music] victory bless your name father although it may [Music] be from this from today may it be our new day that today be the beginning to something great in our [Music] lives thank you Father

I'm happy I'm joyful I'm thankful with my God he's the kind of God I want to serve he's the type of God I want to serve he he gives us a new from that time on he gives us a new opportunity he gave that woman caught in adultery he gave her a new opportunity and he's he told her go and just don't do it again I don't condemn you let me say I can serve that kind of a God I could serve a God Like That a God can that can that can deliver a a gadan man I imagine that when Jesus arrived to him that day devils and demons were clinging to him they did not want to go away but my God is so great that even if you have demons clinging to you to you grabbing hold of you with all they can he can give you a from that time he can give it to youe God that I want to and I can serve I don't know about you but I want want to serve that type of God that gives us a from that time a new from that time amen if you don't feel that this is of your from that time moment that it would be a preparation for your at that time moment did you know every time you cry out to God every time you go to the alt every time you make the the effort it's not a waste of time you are storing up Faith you are storing up [Music] strength it's if you know for example examp a piece of ice it has a certain temperature where it begins to melt it's it's [Music] F you may be at zero degrees you may be at zero and you come to the altar and you you go up a degree the ice is still there but you're at one degree closer you cry out to God a little more the next service you you go up another degree you come up 30 times to
