[11:25] of we'll be reading from verse
[11:28] 23
[11:32] the name of the Lord
[11:58] morning say Amen when you have the
[12:14] scripture says
[12:17] heudes
[12:23] went he was there
[12:28] alone
[12:34] but the ship was now in the mid of the
[12:36] sea TOS with waves for the
[12:45] wind and in the of the night Jesus them
[12:49] the
[12:58] sea
[13:02] and when the disciples saw him walking
[13:03] on the scene they were troubled saying
[13:06] it is a spirit and they cried out of
[13:15] fear but straight Jesus spake unto them
[13:18] saying of good cheer it is I not
[13:28] afraid
[13:32] and and Peter answered him and said Lord
[13:35] if it is if it be thou me come unto on
[13:48] the and he said come and when Peter was
[13:51] come down out of the ship he walked on
[13:54] the to go to
[13:58] Jesus
[14:00] there's always
[14:13] a but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[14:16] was afraid and beginning to sink he
[14:19] cried saying Lord save
[14:28] me
[14:33] and immediately Jesus stretched forth
[14:34] his hand and caught him and said unto
[14:37] him oh thou of little faith wherefor
[14:39] this thou
[14:43] doubt we'll be making a small prayer
[14:45] father in these
[14:47] moments we come before your
[14:52] presence we recognize our
[14:57] position we recognize where before your
[15:02] bride do not allow my words to come out
[15:05] of me
[15:09] Lord and anything that comes out be for
[15:12] edifying
[15:14] Lord we place this in your
[15:17] hands in the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:21] Christ you may take your seats
[15:26] Brethren I'd like to read another
[15:29] scripture in first of
[15:32] John if You' like to follow me with your
[15:35] Bible or we they can put it up
[15:40] here 1 John 4:8
[15:45] says there's no fear and
[15:49] love but perfect
[15:53] love casteth out
[15:57] fear I'd like to read that beginning
[16:00] part of Verse
[16:03] 18 there is no fear in
[16:07] love but perfect
[16:11] love casteth out
[16:18] fear we've been reading reading this
[16:21] beautiful passage in the word of
[16:27] God
[16:32] we realized that the disciples were
[16:34] going through a difficult
[16:38] situation they had not received the Holy
[16:44] Spirit I believe when the person hasn't
[16:47] received the Holy
[16:52] Spirit it's very hard to be guided by
[16:55] the same Holy
[16:57] Spirit now that the Holy Spirit can come
[17:00] upon a
[17:01] person or be beside a
[17:05] person but it's not the same when the
[17:08] Holy
[17:09] Spirit is inside a
[17:13] person we see that the the
[17:16] disciples were in the
[17:18] sea on a
[17:21] ship Jesus was praying the scripture
[17:26] says a great storm came
[17:30] came were coming in that
[17:34] sea we we see that when that
[17:38] began when the waves
[17:43] started when this there was a storm
[17:46] beginning in the sea the sea began to
[17:50] move they had
[17:53] fear now
[17:55] fear is an
[17:57] enemy of faith
[17:59] yes when a
[18:04] person begins to have fear in their
[18:07] heart I want us to understand that
[18:13] fear something that the devil has always
[18:15] wanted to use through
[18:19] ages the same thing he used a thousand
[18:21] years
[18:23] ago in the Dark
[18:27] Ages and past
[18:31] ages the devil is using the same thing
[18:37] today the devil has always tried to
[18:40] bring fear to the children of
[18:42] God because the devil
[18:44] knows that if you and
[18:48] I begin to have fear in
[18:53] us we will not be able to see
[18:57] clearly what God wants to do with
[19:00] us in this uh
[19:03] passage
[19:05] Peter
[19:07] dared as we said previous
[19:10] weeks pet daring the daring
[19:14] Peter watching the
[19:20] storm there was a moment when he didn't
[19:22] care what was happening around
[19:27] him Prophet says in the message perfect
[19:34] Faith he says Peter without the holy
[19:36] spirit in that
[19:39] moment he had a perfect
[19:42] faith when he focused on
[19:46] Jesus when he placed his sight on
[19:49] Jesus nothing mattered to
[19:52] him when he put his
[19:56] sight there he had perfect faith
[19:59] fath because perfect
[20:02] Faith the prophet speaks to us in this
[20:06] message you don't look
[20:09] around you don't look to what's
[20:11] happening
[20:12] around you don't see the circumstances
[20:14] around
[20:17] you you don't care if your if your
[20:20] neighbor is welcoming
[20:22] you you don't care if your neighbor
[20:25] isn't having
[20:27] anything
[20:29] Church it doesn't matter if the message
[20:31] isn't hitting
[20:33] you if a person has the correct
[20:37] Faith it's between them and
[20:40] God that's when you believe in your
[20:43] heart not mattering
[20:46] anything it's a decision in your
[20:49] interior and the exterior
[20:52] things have nothing to
[20:56] do when we can find that perfect
[21:00] Faith
[21:02] now
[21:06] Peter the prophet says there was a
[21:09] moment where he reached perfect
[21:13] faith and when he was in that
[21:17] atmosphere he said these
[21:19] words Lord if it is
[21:24] thou let me go to you upon the
[21:27] sea this calls my
[21:32] attention because when you're in that
[21:34] atmosphere of that perfect
[21:38] faith when you're believing in your
[21:41] heart you can ask for anything you
[21:47] want when you've gone to that situation
[21:49] to that
[21:52] place when you know that you're in
[21:54] harmony with
[21:56] God if it's in church outside of
[22:01] church if you're in your bedroom
[22:03] kneeling at your bed beside your
[22:06] bed when you find that Harmon or
[22:08] fellowship with
[22:10] God that Harmony between you and
[22:14] God you can ask for whatever you desire
[22:17] and God
[22:18] grants because it's come
[22:21] to to that perfect
[22:24] Faith it's beautiful to get
[22:27] there
[22:29] and truly you know when you haven't
[22:31] gotten
[22:34] there I realize sometimes when I'm
[22:39] praying and I saying Lord take care of
[22:42] my wife take care of my
[22:45] children but while I'm
[22:47] praying if it's in my
[22:53] mind you begin to have a conversation
[22:56] with
[22:57] god
[23:00] and the deeper you get in that
[23:01] relationship with
[23:04] God you're getting to that perfect
[23:07] Faith what is perfect Faith to believe
[23:11] God not with nothing else mattering that
[23:14] nothing else
[23:16] matters now
[23:19] Peter when he got to this
[23:22] place to that perfect Faith Like The
[23:25] Prophet
[23:26] says he said Lord if it be
[23:31] thou allow me to walk upon the
[23:35] sea Jesus qu uh answer is simple it's
[23:40] come
[23:45] come now Jesus knew that Peter was in
[23:47] that perfect
[23:50] faith I want you to understand that
[23:53] Peter did not have
[23:54] fear he did not see the waves he didn't
[23:58] see the the
[23:59] storm he saw
[24:02] Jesus now Peter gets off the
[24:06] ship and he begins
[24:12] walking the Bible and the message that
[24:14] I've seen doesn't specifically
[24:20] say how much time did Peter walk on the
[24:25] sea but the Bible says he walked upon on
[24:28] the
[24:30] sea I want you to understand that Peter
[24:32] walked upon the
[24:35] sea when Peter was in that perfect
[24:38] harmony with
[24:40] God his sight put on
[24:43] Jesus he walked on water
[24:46] Brethren the problem
[24:51] was when he stopped looking at
[24:57] Jesus
[24:59] but the Bible says seeing the boisterous
[25:03] wind there was a moment when
[25:07] Peter stop seeing
[25:11] Jesus he took his side off
[25:15] Jesus and he saw the condition he was
[25:20] in what a terrible problem that
[25:24] is because when I have my side put on
[25:27] Jesus
[25:29] I feel
[25:31] Invincible I don't know about you
[25:32] brother and
[25:35] sister but when you've connected in the
[25:37] Channel with
[25:39] God you can feel like you can do
[25:43] anything you can create your own
[25:46] atmosphere you can claim your
[25:49] healing you can claim your
[25:54] deliverance you can say I can do
[25:57] anything
[25:58] because you're in harmony with
[26:01] God but the problem
[26:05] is when we see our
[26:11] circumstances I feel
[26:13] skinny until I see myself in the
[26:17] mirror has that not happened to
[26:21] you yes I I I feel slim and I
[26:24] jump when I'm playing volleyball I feel
[26:27] Slim
[26:28] [Music]
[26:30] nothing matters to
[26:33] me and this is not a joke because we're
[26:36] in the
[26:37] Pulpit but I want you to understand what
[26:40] I'm saying while we're speaking
[26:42] nothing's good for
[26:43] us it's not good for us to preach a
[26:45] sermon if you're not
[26:50] understanding so there's occasions where
[26:52] we feel a certain
[26:55] way but when I come to that mirror and I
[26:57] say
[26:59] well reality is
[27:02] different
[27:04] Peter when he had his side put on Jesus
[27:07] he walked upon the sea
[27:09] brother and this morning you can walk
[27:12] upon the
[27:13] sea put your sight on
[27:20] Jesus now he begins to see the
[27:22] circumstances around
[27:24] him and automatically brethren
[27:29] he begins to
[27:33] sink because when we begin to see our
[27:35] own
[27:38] condition sometimes our condition is
[27:42] sad sometimes when you see your
[27:46] sickness and you say I'm still
[27:49] sick that affects many times
[27:52] but so you can receive your
[27:56] healing when we see our
[27:59] circumstances around
[28:05] us now I'd like to read a little of what
[28:07] the prophet
[28:08] speaks of
[28:12] Faith so I was reading this
[28:16] message and something that came to my
[28:18] mind was
[28:23] this Lord why do we sometimes lose lose
[28:26] the substance like the prophet said
[28:32] because what the prophet says is that
[28:33] Peter there lost the
[28:35] substance of
[28:38] faith and we were saying in previous
[28:41] weeks that when you lose the
[28:45] substance I believe I believe I
[28:49] believe there's no substance in what
[28:51] you're
[28:53] saying the wind takes your words
[28:57] okay
[28:58] but the prophet speaks to us and
[29:02] says speaking of
[29:06] faith faith and love are family
[29:12] members because one cannot have
[29:16] faith unless they have
[29:18] [Music]
[29:21] love this CS my attention what the
[29:23] prophet is saying the prophet continues
[29:27] saying
[29:29] because because your faith is in
[29:34] God who is the essence of
[29:38] love Faith and
[29:42] love work
[29:46] together this caus my
[29:49] attention because sometimes I see Faith
[29:52] here like the first step of the
[29:57] pyramid
[29:58] and sometimes I see love all the way up
[30:02] here and when I am in faith and I look
[30:08] up I see God's perfect love High very
[30:14] high I see his love higher and I say I
[30:16] will never get
[30:19] there sometimes I'm barely trying to
[30:22] trust has that not happened to
[30:26] you it be if you're Faith virtue or
[30:31] patience but there's a few words that
[30:33] the Bible says that I enjoy a
[30:36] lot and sometimes I say them very often
[30:40] and it's this that
[30:41] says he that began the
[30:44] work will Perfection the work in
[30:50] us it's God who's taking us
[30:55] brother it's God responsible if he began
[30:58] something in you and
[31:01] I he will finish the work that began in
[31:05] us I give God I give thanks to the Lord
[31:09] for because I say Lord I'm in your
[31:12] hands and it depending on
[31:15] you where do you want to take me
[31:20] to and I believe God wants to take us to
[31:24] Perfection
[31:26] look you have to have
[31:34] faith and if you put one to the north
[31:37] and one to the
[31:42] South when you put Faith North and and
[31:47] love at your
[31:53] South and that love
[31:55] beats one for the other
[32:00] it doesn't matter where they
[32:04] are here the prophet makes an example of
[32:07] a couple that's in
[32:10] love they can have distance between each
[32:14] other but that love is beating in
[32:18] them I'm closing with this
[32:21] Brethren you never SE for
[32:25] God no man can come to me
[32:29] if the
[32:30] father does not bring
[32:36] you and God came to that
[32:40] worldliness what you
[32:42] were and he seek for you and he brought
[32:46] you
[32:47] out this is God's love for us
[32:51] brotherr this is God doing this for
[32:56] us
[32:58] that should make a perfect
[33:03] love see what you were and look at where
[33:06] you are
[33:08] now now there
[33:12] Brethren that should cause something in
[33:15] you to see where I
[33:18] was and to see where I am
[33:22] now the love that God had for
[33:25] us to come down to world
[33:30] and to bring us out of that
[33:33] riness and put us in Heavenly places
[33:35] hallelujah
[33:38] hallelu what did that
[33:42] do what did that do says the
[33:47] prophet someone that loved
[33:52] you then how can you not have
[33:56] faith
[33:58] and what he has promised
[34:01] you the genuine love and true
[34:06] love will make
[34:08] trust will create
[34:12] trust when you falling in love with
[34:16] God when you realize what he's done for
[34:20] you eternal love I've loved you says the
[34:26] Bible when you realize of that
[34:30] love what has that love done for
[34:34] you the prophet of God says the true
[34:37] genuine
[34:39] love trust in his
[34:42] word hallelujah
[34:45] hallelujah that
[34:48] love that that we're having that we're
[34:52] falling in love with with
[34:56] God will create
[34:58] trust to his
[35:02] word now when I have a
[35:04] doubt or when doubts come to
[35:08] me let's remember of God's
[35:12] love what God has done for
[35:15] us with how much love has he loved
[35:19] us and that should
[35:22] create
[35:23] trust towards his word to say Lord
[35:29] what you've done for
[35:31] me is nothing in
[35:33] vain so I will believe
[35:36] you not mattering
[35:39] anything you loved
[35:42] me I'm loving
[35:44] you and that
[35:48] love I will deposit my trust on that
[35:52] love where you take me on
[35:54] mountains in the
[35:56] valley I will continue loving you
[36:00] Lord because you love me
[36:03] first bless be the name of Lord God

[1:40:16] years in September pre preaching the
[1:40:20] gospel but my conviction for 40 years in
[1:40:22] September
[1:40:24] remember I always make three services if
[1:40:27] it's with three or four people I
[1:40:31] glad it changed
[1:40:35] me I preach in the name and the trity
[1:40:39] but I still needed something else I
[1:40:41] wasn't
[1:40:45] complete sometimes you don't feel like
[1:40:46] you just eat a little bit and and you
[1:40:48] you stay
[1:40:51] empty you need more
[1:40:54] that's how we were it's
[1:40:57] true we want more we couldn't
[1:41:01] understand but the Revelation came the
[1:41:05] message
[1:41:06] came the message
[1:41:09] came has transformed
[1:41:11] us we're
[1:41:16] natural we we are also
[1:41:21] Supernatural Hallelujah
[1:41:24] and what that
[1:41:26] means to say we are
[1:41:31] Supernatural because we are above all
[1:41:34] nature you see a new
[1:41:37] vehicle it's fine you see a
[1:41:40] building you say it's
[1:41:43] fine but you're above all of
[1:41:46] that we're above Earthly
[1:41:50] things God
[1:41:52] blesses
[1:41:54] but your heart isn't there you're not
[1:41:56] from
[1:41:57] here we're at wedding brother and he
[1:42:01] comes the the great supper is
[1:42:03] coming we're in a true expectation we
[1:42:06] don't know what
[1:42:07] time but something is happening he's
[1:42:10] transforming us every
[1:42:14] day I feel that he's transforming
[1:42:17] me for 40 years in September you're
[1:42:21] invited Hallelujah
[1:42:24] but he's transforming
[1:42:25] [Music]
[1:42:27] me I feel like I'm just beginning to
[1:42:29] walk with
[1:42:32] God something is
[1:42:35] happening I hate
[1:42:38] myself because I know that Santio is
[1:42:41] evil yes you
[1:42:42] no Jesus said to hate
[1:42:47] ourselves hate your own
[1:42:50] life your own desire your own thoughts
[1:42:54] the man is Earthly he does not
[1:42:57] understand he can't
[1:43:00] understand but God sent us a powerful
[1:43:02] message to
[1:43:06] understand and to receive and be
[1:43:10] different and I've say to the Lord
[1:43:12] something's
[1:43:15] happening so I say Lord I must deny
[1:43:20] myself I would like to stay somewhere in
[1:43:22] the the mountain by
[1:43:28] myself but God is just always putting
[1:43:30] people there to follow
[1:43:32] me maybe for a
[1:43:34] punishment maybe maybe to take care of
[1:43:38] myself
[1:43:40] yes I love this message I love his word
[1:43:44] and something is
[1:43:46] happening I have to reject this
[1:43:50] man he wants the Earthly
[1:43:54] he wants to be good he wants to enjoy
[1:44:03] everything but the one on the
[1:44:05] inside he wants to see
[1:44:09] Christ he is in
[1:44:13] glory he wants a spiritual man he
[1:44:17] understands Paul
[1:44:20] said the natural man truly does not
[1:44:22] understand
[1:44:25] and this is the
[1:44:26] truth and when I understand myself I can
[1:44:29] understand you just like I struggle you
[1:44:32] struggle just like I fight you're
[1:44:35] fighting all of us all of
[1:44:40] us but without a battle there isn't a
[1:44:42] crown there's no
[1:44:44] Victory sometimes God allows us to
[1:44:47] struggle God allows all of that and he's
[1:44:51] transforming me
[1:44:54] let me tell
[1:44:56] you I've been wanting to have a
[1:45:07] wife and my desires to bring out this
[1:45:09] message and you that have wives that are
[1:45:12] of the message bring out all that love
[1:45:16] that love of
[1:45:18] Christ that uh
[1:45:20] comfort that help encourage your wife
[1:45:25] she is human like you
[1:45:31] amen but I want to reject
[1:45:35] myself I want to reject
[1:45:39] myself I know who I
[1:45:41] am you know who you
[1:45:44] are you know who you
[1:45:46] are I still know who I
[1:45:49] am but something is happening this
[1:45:52] message
[1:45:54] is making me come
[1:45:57] higher and I say no I'm going to quit to
[1:46:00] everything and I'm going to follow God
[1:46:03] maybe I can help someone
[1:46:04] someday there's so much need
[1:46:09] Hallelujah and for
[1:46:13] love so that se that's in the four
[1:46:15] corners of the earth I have to I have to
[1:46:19] reject
[1:46:20] myself you as well
[1:46:23] amen
[1:46:26] hallelujah and not anybody can get
[1:46:31] there but this power is taking you there

[2:03:20] understand
[2:03:22] when you love a person it's the best
[2:03:26] person your children are the
[2:03:31] best I told Titus one day he went to
[2:03:33] Watsonville he we were eating I said I
[2:03:36] said
[2:03:40] Son continue studying I said we were
[2:03:43] eating and I said you know

[2:03:52] with your
[2:03:55] mistakes he does not have a notebook of
[2:03:58] my
[2:03:58] mistakes because I believe
[2:04:01] it because he loves
[2:04:03] me and he's made me
[2:04:07] believe what father is writing the
[2:04:09] mistakes of her children or what
[2:04:11] mother maybe there are some but I don't
[2:04:15] have because I love my children so
[2:04:18] much I don't want anybody to harm them
[2:04:21] or hurt
[2:04:24] them they'll make me
[2:04:26] angry
[2:04:28] behave they they matter to
[2:04:31] me while I'm living there's a prayer for
[2:04:33] them that's how parents are yes or no
[2:04:36] because we love them and we cry with
[2:04:39] them we suffer with
[2:04:41] them we are sleep deprived with them
[2:04:44] glory to
[2:04:46] God and the more you suffer the more you
[2:04:50] loveu
[2:04:56] and this word is true for me there's
[2:04:58] nothing they're the best all of
[2:05:02] them my
[2:05:04] daughters they stand up for me I know
[2:05:07] they love
[2:05:09] me I know they love
[2:05:15] me but I'm just barely getting to my
[2:05:20] point if there's a person
[2:05:23] here do
[2:05:25] it that truly I would do it if there
[2:05:28] would be a person
[2:05:30] here that feels WR with me that I've
[2:05:34] caused harm that I harmed them that I
[2:05:36] did a wrong to
[2:05:39] them I would ask for
[2:05:41] [Music]
[2:05:42] forgiveness I would ask for forgiveness
[2:05:44] to my son Titus I've scolded him and
[2:05:47] punished
