mystery is that have been hidden the glory which is christ and you the hope of glory let us pray i would like to thank those that are always here faithfully you can trust on the team god has set here and i want to tell you have a great team we have flaws we have mistakes but we have thank god man and plenty of youth when uh [Music] they paid almost all of their expenses uh he's implemented um [Music] the reason b he doesn't do it through us it won't be done he's prepared in case we failed ministry purposes is he does not have a substitute said lord why do i have come [Applause] something that's worth it have you ever asked yourself that it's because jesus saw this man's potential if he left it all [Music] and how because we aren't um hope um you don't know how much it means to them [Applause] as our pastor said significant the way they makes you feel very small indignant unworthy the tanto mora man of so much love amen um they have a lot of love for us even though they haven't met us yet um they have brother we also had the opportunity to meet sister elia's family brother-in-law of our sister he told me he is watching so make sure that i send him a greeting brother sends you a lot of greetings for every one of you amen amen um i also learned a lot on this trip la cultura mexican culture is a lot different from here um how it looks for the roads the houses but also the people here people are more shy over there people have love for you even though they haven't met you um vienen como silo [Music] we were on a class for brother edgar's sons because it was also had family relatives there's another branch of our church out there what's our pastor said let's do it with everything god bless you god bless you god bless everyone and for providing for this trip is and all the brothers and sisters that served us with all their with a lot of love we noticed it in the food it's the [Music] different than going to a youth camp or some special services a special service or a youth camp i was sharing with the brothers from over there okay in the beginning i felt as though i was still in fort collins um he he i must switch to english okay um i think this trip really changed me because i had to go out of my comfort zone i had to not only meet new people but talk to them in a language that i'm not very strongly encouraged aside from all that apart i felt at home you're missing t in casa and i miss a lot the brothers the sisters um the youth is livia yeah brian brandon yeah brandon and i think fernanda yeah fernando fernanda and i think also the i think they're the sabrinas of [Music] [Music] um tango [Applause] god bless you brothers delis vendi garmanos it's nice to be back home is bueno starting casa de nuevo um we missed every single one of you guys um it was my first missionary trip with uh my dad and my brother diego and just a first missionary trip out of the united states and uh yeah i just want to give thanks as well to my pastor and just really see that the love for the people had already seen it but now being next to his side i just seen the sorry brothers and just seeing how privileged we really are to have a pastor by and you know um yeah it was just a big privilege to go on this trip um like our sister mariana said how do you recommend it not just to the youth but to anyone else they're amazing brothers and um i remember something that our brother ergot said over there we're doing a circle and we're kind of just getting to know everyone and this really touched me yes you know we're just in the freezer frozen and just how you know we preached on friday meet diego and my brother isaac here just how people come to you tell you that man that preacher really helped me you don't know what i was going through when people two times the age of of eighteen cuando alguien que and you know these preachings that we had over there it wasn't just to our brothers over there yeah they really touched me as well you know i didn't realize the potential i had in me to be able to go on these trips and touch these brothers um and you know i just remember our brother eric and my dad preaching about record you know materials that were made out of london that was saturday night friday we preached about the trust in the process and then our brother titus finished it off but yeah you know i would just recommend it your recommendation just everything all the food was pretty good but that's not what the main point is main point is to go touch at least one soul principle and i really like something that my brother diego said he said groundbreaking and you know because we're breaking ground over there to try to plant a seed but yeah god bless you brothers [Applause] yes it was a very special it was something special that god allowed me to have a one-on-one with all the sisters and god allowed me to feel for the people on this trip there wasn't anyone there um i was able to identify with everyone there los ninos from the children and also to the most uh older people um when i was a young girl in mexico the needs out there um they've all been hurt at some point in our lives we don't want to come to church we only need someone to give us that push is when brother isaac was saying of the circle we did to get to know each other i shared with the brethren one of the reasons i was there in a i also struggle socializing with new people my cousins they are an extension from us i was able to see how god moves and simplicity the more simple you become the more god can use you yes petitions being answered of people espana and i was very happy to be part of that um marianna's and sister eileen and i could see how our lives are very similar where she's been able to overcome things i'm not able to establish i've been able to overcome things that she is struggling with i would tell her elena i admire you yeah melissa no pero lo que todos vista and this blessing was a this trip was a blessing forgive me yes and i want to encourage everyone who can go okay and if you're not able to be i believe [Applause] little as a slow if i feel like that's yes i don't have enough hair um full with uh being able to serve the people it and we started testifying and i i told him how there was always a faithful witness in every trial amenity a billboard [Applause] i'll tell you why [Music] [Applause] god bless you that's all i have [Applause] uh i want to read this scripture that i've read over there ii corinthians 4. verse 7. but we have this treasure in earthen earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we are troubled on every side sometimes you give a place a lot of butts and meditating god shows me should make from i give thanks to god for that

pence god was going to provide or something the week before a few days leading up to it god provided me with the small rays an extra income from another thing i did that covered almost all of the costs and i knew that that was god i had the in my mind too i wanted the expectation to change my mentality okay mentality of um to just see how important it is um what we do here and since arriving there and how they received us it's like i already knew them and they already knew me alone it was like the same people the same love from here many people asked me if i felt homesick muchas personas
