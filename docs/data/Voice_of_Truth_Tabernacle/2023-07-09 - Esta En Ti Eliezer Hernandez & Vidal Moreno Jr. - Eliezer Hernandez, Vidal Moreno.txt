foreign [Music] thank you [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] wow [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] senior [Music] [Music] boys foreign foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] yes Allah [Music] Jesus Christ [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] la gracio um [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] that's better [Music] soon manana yes sir Los Angeles [Music] okay [Music] God bless you foreign [Music] [Music] hello mano [Music] yes sir [Music] oh El Mysterio [Music] [Music] [Music] sir your service [Music] alcohol [Music] yes [Music] [Music] on del Mundo [Music] West no more [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] please [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] forced him that is something great for that sacrifice we are all here standing all here giving him glory I mean he deserves it this morning we give thanks to God for the opportunity we'll be reading two scriptures first one is in John 4. and verse 13 and 14. John 14 13 and 14. it is first of John 4 from verse 4 to verse 7. we also take advantage for the opportunity agreed everyone watching live in the internet and we also agreed everyone visiting it may be a blessing for you to be here Jesus answered said unto her whosoever drinking of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life now first of John chapter 4 verse 4. when you have you can say Amen first John 4 4 reads benzido ye are of God little children and have overcame them now notice this because greater is he that is in you I'm gonna read it again because greater is he that is in you then he that is in the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them Nosotros we are of God adios he that is not of God not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error amados beloved let us love one another foreign [Music] [Music] brother so God's word tells us the greater is he that is in US aura now is obviously God's word says he wants to be inside us he wants to be inside us now we're still under the subject the coming of the Lord our pastor has been focusing on the Rapture asosie that's our thought always keep that in mind now the Rapture we're speaking of noise Rapture is only for the bride yes so if the bride is waiting for a Rapture the bride should be preparing for this Rapture this is if we were not waiting foreign but the holy spirit is uniting every piece you cannot untie things and think that everything is happening just because for coincidence no God is speaking to us in a certain way and many of us that's why God has different gifts God gave certain abilities form them in a certain way so if they don't understand someone in one way foreign and that's okay to come to church and he also says it's also not okay because you don't come how you should because many come to church and don't take anything what was the point in that what's the point in a rapture [Music] many think because they don't believe in a Rapture it's not going to happen many think because they don't believe in a prophet there isn't one Bueno pero is the first grain exactly and the message leadership to return life this is in paragraph 136 a message leadership it reads the first corn of wheat the bridegroomed hard to fall into the Earth in order to rise again so did the first part I was born at Pentecost how to go through that Dark Ages like any other seeds but it started sprouting move continuously with God if we stay dwarfs something is wrong something wasn't done well amen amen this is but it was the light of that day the stock then went on on into a tassel Wesley is and from the tassel it went into Pentecost the shook when you see into the wheat when it comes foreign but if you take a tweezer and sit down and take that weed and open it up there's no grain there at all it's just a shock and then what is it's formed there to hold the grains and then the first thing you know the life left the stock to go into the tassel go into the ship and goes into the wheat three stages and then forms a weed outside of three stages you can interrupt nature they cannot interrupt nature brother advance it's hard to be the bride pero sisters but if you settle with being the one that hands a glass of water to the bride you are risking too much you have to go to the highest price we have one foot in the water why not it's so emergency and this Fountain of Life you can't have nature forgive me we can't stop now as much as you want to stop nature I'm going to stay in this place I'm gonna stay here nothing's and No One's Gonna Move Me if you put yourself aside hey instead that's you but if you hold on to them brother says the live shoot the stock back there here carries the life certainly it did become the stock and it was finished the organization the life run right on into Wesley because cuarento uh won a big blade does not look like the grains but when the little pollen comes like on the shook or on the stock the pollen of the tassel it looks like a whole lot of like the grains but when it comes down to that shook it's almost there didn't Jesus say in the last days so close it would deceive the very jeans the elect once if it was possible almost like the real thing when you want to stay in just one place Brethren but I mean for me personally it's like if you want to force something that isn't you're forcing something that isn't as he said there are many things that are in US president did you know your healing is in you did you know that the body heals itself because it's in itself already generation that process is called regeneration there are cells that regeneration if you cut yourself something forms where the skin begins to close again and regenerates [Music] he's gonna give it to us in a natural way so we can understand it in a spiritual way and forgive me if you're falling asleep one day my father was driving with a brother or my father was a passenger and a brother was driving and the brother was falling asleep and this brother told my father that was in the passengers he's falling asleep he says what just happened contender and you people here Harvest apples I have understood you have a lot of activities did you know when the apple tree is half an inch tallness every Apple that tree is gonna give it is in that tree already the life is already in there you can't see the fruits but the life is inside of it did you know all those 100 pounds of leaves that will fall are in it at that moment every flower is there in that moment every limb is in it at that moment if it is they came from in donde esta where is it where do they come from what do you do you take the seed and sow it the tree comes out yes you have to continue watering it has to keep drinking it has to drink and drink until they pushes out and it'll push out limbs it'll push out apples it's in it yesterday it's already in it but it has to keep drinking and every word of God and every word of God is a seed is and if that seed can be planted by then exhausted which is inside us to grow he wants you to ask for great things for your joy to be fulfilled could you imagine a little fish about that big doesn't matter how big the fish is imagine the biggest fish you imagine a little fish about that big way out yonder in the Atlantic Ocean say I better drink just a little bit of water I might run out nonsense nonsense could you imagine a little mouse about that big down there in that great Gardeners of Egypt saying I just better eat two grains a day because I might run out before summer time again well that's nonsense if they had 10 hundred thousands rats that size they've never eat it up and they had billions times billions of tons of them fish they'd never drink that water multiplication and how many times could we multiply you can never exhaust God in his powers and his mercies to his children of life just drink baby and drink baby and drink and drink what does the bride have in her what is the bride have in her she has a fulfillment of because the bride not only fulfills listen correct right listen to me she brings the entire world to fulfillment I'll leave you with Brother yeah God bless you uh it's good to be in the house of the Lord this is a special day today a special day yesterday was my birthday and uh today is uh our anniversary reminding my wives it's a it's a very special uh you know she she's been with me uh when I when I had nothing he has to work on me when I felt like nothing yeah and uh you know uh um honestly um it just it just keeps getting better because after I met her she took me uh to uh my uh true love yes the Lord Jesus Christ you know she was the instrument God used to to bring me to uh to Christ God used her yeah and uh you know it's that's special to me I felt like I had no purpose but uh you know she believed in me when I didn't believe in myself and I'm thankful to the Lord you know for uh for being able to to have her por podert so God bless her and let us just open our our Bibles to the Book of Genesis it is like this this I see and Enoch lived 60 and five years and began Methuselah if you're an ox Center is not walked with God after he began Methuselah 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 360 in five years and Enoch walked with God amen amen uh you know uh a few weeks back as soon as I was just kind of contemplating I was just you know I couldn't go to sleep it was a Sunday around Domingo good morning Domingo and it's one thing I can identify with a foreign [Music] so I started looking on the calendario and uh you know I was born on a Sunday and I I started I called my mom I asked my mom so Mom do you remember when when I was born you know my mom she she always said I'd be a preacher and uh because you know that's when you were born so you know I just kind of took that for myself Anton says you know that doesn't mean everybody has to go do that but uh I just took it for myself I took it personally that I was born for service I was born for the service of the Lord that's what I was called here to do what I saw foreign when I see that uh you know when you see your name in the Bible that's that's special yeah that's extra special you would have a name like David be able to have a name like Titus Jacob you know even to be you know just be among the angels list you know it's it's special it's a special because you know I believe that in all throughout all the Davis there is you should be able to identify what's that except you know if there's a Jacob in the Bible you should be able to say man God's talking to me to be able to have the name of Isaac it's just it's just something special you know you're you God thought about you he wasn't just talking about the the Jacob in in or the Isaac in the Bible but if he was talking about all the Isis themselves in God's word amen amen I believe that with all my heart you know but I believe in in the Bible what type of the Bride I believe he not had something special uh you know because when he says this he says in the message a lord show us and Lord show us the father and it suffice to us he says he says and that's the way a Christian is we are planted together in Christ Jesus Jesus who is the inexhaustible Fountain of Life since we are planted in Christ and we just drink and drinks and we push out and everything we have need of for the Earthly Journey Divine Healing the power of God and all these other things is in every individual in here that's received the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is for you are planted in Christ hallelujah hallelujah it says the Holy Ghost baptism and everything you have needed for this life for this life's journey even the Rapture is this Anton says it says don't resent that no serious oh that's the truth the Rapture is in us it's in you right now amen amen if you can accept that then then it's for you amen amen but we have to accept it there has to be authors for God's things you know in order for us to be able to to desire it is to be able to walk with God you know because the Bible says Enoch walked with God okay I realize he had a revelation you see faith is a revelation and Rapture the Rapture is also a revelation he was not walking in the blind the image was revealed to him foreign body can live you know anybody can live dollar sport mbv no but that doesn't mean you're walking yeah you could be living man you can be paralyzed amen amen what kind of life would that be you know if we were just paralyzed I wouldn't call that lived if you were unable to do those things talking about spiritually speaking all right because I believe that although some people might be paralyzed they don't have to stay depressed that that does not stop them from worship foreign you see we asked the question why why am I not going anywhere Direction why am I not advancing foreign it says for you see Faith sees what God wants done he says I hope this goes in he says faith doesn't look at the present time Faith doesn't see this here Faith looks to see what God wants and works accordingly see that's what faith amen amen this is shooter knows that see it's long range it's a telescope that you don't look around don't use binoculars to look to see what time it is [Music] but you use binoculars and Faith does that is every promise that he made cheese says he looks at the end he doesn't drop his sights down to look this way he looks he keeps the cross your dead center on the words we have a revelation too foreign [Music] Manera why porque thank God to Revelation amen amen because amen amen that's what it is many you made many many of you may feel like Moses it wasn't always like that for Moses how were Moses he had his these down times but pero you know brother I just want to read this real quick this is Moses had been a total failure there may be men here this afternoon maybe ministers there's been total failures he says maybe you've been a housewife maybe you've been as a student at school maybe you've been as a child to your parents I like what he says whatever you have been look you said let that be has been good and start from today no matter what it is maybe you've been a failure maybe you failed to go on with God if it has been take note to what I'm gonna say but it doesn't have to stay there foreign [Music] you were made for something greater foreign brother Branham says this is he says will glory to God he healed me he says that's it SOS he said that's the idea and science like that says Keep On Believing he says you are the Seed of Abraham he says you will believe it that way you can't help to believe it is you see you have to believe in order for there to be a revelation you have to believe it is Corazon they're being a Christian can sell Cristiano they're walking with godos it's not second nature to me second nature noise that's actually and see that was my original Nation that's original that's what I did the beginning I may not be there at the moments the beginning you may say then why do I suffer why do I go through pain why do I keep failing why do all these bad things keep happening [Music] I mean that this will stop you from my primary nature just died from going back to where I was but what I'm going back to is [Music] but that doesn't stop me it doesn't stop me from keep going to stop me from keep racing higher every day every morning by God's grace [Music] I believe it yolo I accept it you're acceptable it's for me I can't say that for you I believe it's foreign needs to be filled for his bride yeah he's waiting for every moment not desire the brothers not desire the brothers but to take yours [Music] said that's what he calls you for but we're all a part of the body and we're here yes I'm fighting every day I'm working for the kingdom because we love them that's what it is foreign [Music] that was for our Lord may you give it a little stronger he deserves everything God bless his word
