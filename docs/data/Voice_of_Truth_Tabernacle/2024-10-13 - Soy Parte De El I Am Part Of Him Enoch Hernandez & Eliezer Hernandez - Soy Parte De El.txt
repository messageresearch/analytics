scriptures to Genesis 241 we're speaking on a love relationship and as a subtitle I'm going to put I'm a part of him I'm part of him here in Genesis 24 we find a very beautiful picture we see an old man giving uh or giving we see an owner giving a a very harsh task to his uh servant Genesis 241 says like this and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I will make the swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife un my son or the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but thou shall go into my country and to my country and take a wife into to my son Isaac and the servant said unto him per Adventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must I needs bring thy son unto the land from which thou camest Abraham and Abraham said unto him beware that thou that thou though bring not my son thither again the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto seed while I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then Thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son there there again the and the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swear to him concerning this matter if we can take another scripture Revelations 197 we find here in this picture a great responsibility given to this serpent now the servant wasn't just any servant this servant was the eldest of all the serpants and he was the one that was in control of all of Abraham's inheritance he was his Steward Revelations 197 says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready you can have your seats may the Lord have the blessing to his word the word to arrange says is to prepare to prevent to dispose another meaning of arrange in the dictionary is to dress with care to Adorn um I chose to take this scene following what our pastor brought previous a virtuous woman who will find and he commented I believe that they were all the characteristics that God was looking in a bride for this last day in other words that scripture perfectly describes the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ for this last day here Eleazar looking for a bride for his master's son brother brandham says that Eleazar was beginning to sweat this was not any ordinary task of all the things that Abraham had put under eleazar's care this was the most difficult because he knew that he couldn't fail his master but he came out with this with this task and I liked it because one of the things we find in the scripture brother brandham also expresses it is that here goes his messenger with the message of looking for that damor that young lady and to still wait for that young lady to First accept to have a talk with him that she could be still enough so that she could hear the message that he brought and another important thing is that she beli the message this messenger brings and the most difficult thing because if we look at a a couple nowadays we realize that the first thing is attraction but in this case the situation wasn't so he went to go speak to her of him look I'm going to tell you a story my dad says that he was in the apostolic church and he was looking for a young lady and one of his friends came close to him and began to describe to him this young lady and he told her how Christian she was my dad says and I take him by his word that he fell in love with my mother prior to meeting what a beautiful picture beauti picture this shows me how it was with Rebecca is that she just heard and he or he heard and he loved her and in the same way now brother brandham says in the message the evening messenger he says this in paragraph 243 God has always considered the character not the members and we do the things the opposite way we count members good clothing nice paying people in instead of character was beginning to break a sweat a lot until he found character that is the way it is who would he go to counsel and he went to go trust in God character for what character for Isaac the Bride of which the the church is a type you know it that was the natural Seed of Abraham this is the real seed of abrah now now if elz are the messenger looking for a bride and trying to find character if that man has come a messenger in the last days trying to find the bride for Christ he won't look for a membership to a denomination but he'll look for a character that's willing listen first good character then to prepare her to find herself with Isaac after he found character if you read all of the of chapter 24 of Genesis then it was then it was to get her to stay still along to hear his message about Isaac here we first find elaser looking for character and he's prayed to the Lord Lord the young lady that she do this that she do this and this and this the sign that she's going to be that young lady for your son so she went he went near that well there was Rebeca in the evening time [Music] but looking for a bride in the evening and he found her and he found that her that she she didn't think of herself and say what are you asking of me that I give you water woman you are a man take it out for yourself right but no she said yes my Lord I will give you water and all of your camels as well here we found our pastor telling us he says go back to the message and go back it's the Holy Spirit through the angel she didn't have time to begin to ask herself why is he asking me these things why is he asking me not to cut my hair why is he asking me not to be like the woman she didn't have time the message and she took action he didn't have to tell her what to do it was already in the character of serving or the characteristic of serving what a beautiful picture brother today we live in a society that says if you give me I'll give you if you walk I'll walk as well that's the way it is now and each time it gets worse that messenger the last days the evening light will first find the church where they'll believe the m message and look for it can you understand what I'm telling you look if you go to this message the evening time messenger is preaching to us in January of 63 and he's telling the church this messenger he has a mission he's bringing it for and it takes that church it takes that bride or it takes that church that and to begin to dress herself in 63 in January and then comes the 24th feary of 63 this Messer to present a bride to his Lord and not only him seven messers formed this Angel of the Covenant and each one of them represented of that bride and all of them came for Angel to this to bring the culmination the end of this to present it to this messenger and what did the what did the bridegroom come bringing the bridegroom came ready he came with the ring already to put it to the put it on the bride put up the picture of the bride and the ring this bride had already should have been ready already the Earth itself was able to the newspaper said a mysterious ring ring for this bride it was a bridegroom says has already been preached brother says it like this look at the little Rebecca listening to every word a little heart beating he was speaking to her she already she' already been thinking where can I go to and then he went to he went to go find character and have her stay long enough to go and find him how tremendous to prepare for her to say still long enough to hear the message wasn't speaking of himself speak the one who sent him and his message according to him about him wasn't speaking of himself both the word of him who sent him and he had the gifts to show he was set by him this last day bring the Messiah hearts of the people already had the vation he was elazer what did he come looking for for you for me we take our of that falling condition observe the end time messeng his job will be to prepare get the will be his message want to learn the ABCs to be able to study algebra or to go to Al when these other seals are open in the end it'll only be revealed to them look Brothers there's not a message inside of this Mage will prepare to leave in the Raptor we heard it this morning this messenger reveal some seals that it was prohibited from John that angel the angel told John John it doesn't correspond and to say what these seals have spoken because these seals prepare a bride will give her theage she will dress she will find herself with her beloved so then we find we see that the bride isn't wasting time doesn't waste time on YouTube making make her lose time she doesn't waste she wanted to know more of Isaac now brother Ram says in the marriage of the Lamb we know there will be a bride and there will be a marriage there will be a fe I'm sure that the same way that God ex because it is and we know those that form the they will be his church and they will prepare themselves before without wrinkle they have the material now here on Earth here now on the earth to prepare themselves she herself has gotten herself ready many say evil lying or Rob serve him brother the bride surrenders her rights she doesn't think in herself anymore about how she can please her husband look for a lot of time for a long I pray that God take a lot of evil things from my life and God revealed to me that you have to present those things before him to take that decision it equivalates to your destination any bride that chooses a young man a young young man she would surrender her rights that man can guide her guide her to who to the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ not to but I understood that I had to put my part in this flesh take away rid myself and allow him to come into me now he says I'm closing now the Earthly marriage is a type of the Heavenly one the first thing that's required is that you must first make a decision the first thing that you need in the natural is the decision must be made young lady has to make a decision if she decides the same with him to decision must be made she must be the only woman in the world that you love has to be the only man and if it's not that way then marri and when you're married then you've made a wrong choice and that's way the first thing you must do to make a decis it's to decide if you're going to serve God to serve him as your savior accept him as your savior and if you're not going to do it and you're going to go serve the world either you're going to serve the world you have to decide make a decision when you deserve when you decide you're gonna serve god um and Mammon then you realize why that decision must be made and after that you made that decision comes the the promise and that's where you and I to make that promise that promise of putting ourselves leaving the things that hinder us and promising ourselves that we're going to love God more and if you haven't done it up till now take that decision today serve him from here on out don't pray anymore that take away your decision to accept amen wow wow it's a promise you know this messenger eleazer he wasn't promised with the church he wasn't engaged the world around but he was engaged with God PR his promised Covenant was with God a lot of us fall in love with a messenger that's fine to fall love with a messenger that is fine came to make us fall in love with Jesus Christ he didn't come to bring things of himself he came bring us a message that came from God that's fine if you fall with the messenger message is not of the messenger a bear of the message the bride the promise the promise is with God the Covenant is with God amen amen I want you to repeat with me the title of this message I am part of him tell your neighbor the oneide you I'm part of him I'm part of him the Bride of the Lord Jesus [Music] Christ and if you can take me or follow me quickly we give thanks to God for the opportunity gives us Genesis 2:22 we're going to read it quickly Genesis 2:22 and the rib which the Lord God had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man now we see here that God was looking for a bride now this bride must be a part of him so as I was telling you the messenger he only brought the message this bride fall in love with his Lord with that should be near to him I remember when I fell in love with my wife I just wanted to be near to her I wanted to be near her almost nothing separated me from her the bride wants to be close to her group amen amen and I ask myself what makes a bride get away from her Lord what makes a bride get away because even the Bible says Draw N to me and I'll Draw N unto you referring to that scripture brother R says that this this bride the way in which he draws close to him he's always she's always thinking of him she's always conversating or talking with she's always in her news in her in her she doesn't have time for anything else time for the news of the world doesn't have time for social media too much time for social media and more us that we're younger than you much time we have so much time that at any hour we could be on social media at work in the car driving we can be on social media but this bride always thinking of him now when we speak of a bride let me tell you that the devil is also preparing a bride says in the message the God of this evil age and Satan he will soon take an intellectual bride what is brother Bram trying to tell me here Satan is trying to bring or take an intellectual bride only has her thoughts in her head and she leaves them there will exalt this this great one Speaking of Satan who is the Antichrist the hierarchies will place him on a throne and the whole world will Marvel at it what I see there I've always asked myself why if I made a promise to if I would make a promise to go I'm going to surrender completely to you this year is my year I'm GNA keep from doing this stop doing this other thing and for years and years we spoke with brother Ardo in the morning just losing time wasting time Brothers the Bri should be in a high place we should be in a high place I should be in a higher place but we've lost time why have we wasted time intellect because we want to do everything intellectually we only promise but we don't take any action towards no action the Bride of Satan she looks beautiful she looks precious but she takes no action action getting closer to God and then brother Brom says then Christ will come two can't exist at the same time you can't serve one serve the other as well make a decision sooner or later brother in your life you will have to make a decision maybe you say well I don't do anything wrong I don't do anything wrong I'm in my position and everything's fine that's how you were in heaven as well in your position and glorious until there was found or S was like that glorious and in his Splendor until there sooner or later there will be found fall in US must be stripped from us I have nothing wrong with me there's no fault in me my friend brother sister since you were born since you were born this this um first John says first john6 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all Sin from some sins brother or from all sins brothers from all sins did read it right from all if we say that we have no sin deceive [Music] ourselves don't deceive yourself and the truth is not in us we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteous if we say that we have not sinned him a liar his word is not in US brother BR continued saying two cannot exist both of them cannot exist at the same time and his kingdom will be taken and he will be destroyed and Christ the word of God of which the woman is a part of the man's body they are are not one they're two they are one and the bride the the church the church word the word church the people called from here and there from all caused by his name will be brought together in in the body of Christ and the king of the an will be taken and destroyed and Christ will take the throne he's speaking of the God of this evil age okay amen and he will sit upon the throne of his father David and he will re upon the Earth for a thousand years then he will present the church to God without blemish or wrinkle now he begins to describe the B of the Lord Jesus Christ and he begins to say why the long hair this is why the long hair why the long hair because she is a part of him because you are part of him now notice his long hair there's a Nazarite vow to the word I'll describe the bride of Christ now says I'll describe the bride of Christ now we' described the anti where the Bride of the anti so religious and intellectual now the humble bride of Christ simply believes the word she believes the entire word whoever she might be there are individuals is us you it's me say it's me I imagine there's many of them sitting here present many are hearing there through the internet and I hope that I myself brother that every one of you a part of that bride I hope that many and hopefully and all that are ordained to be that will be because it is their nature they see that the word can only recognize the word denomination or perversion it knows the difference it is the bribe you see it can't recognize anything a grain of wheat can be nothing more than a grain of wheat he will continue to be a grain of wheat and then he will keep being a and a weed can never be a weat however it's it's it's still watered by the same anointing it's still it's not a weat as I said it the other day speaking of the of the tree with the different branches in when I see that brother bram's here explaining the story of the prodal son comes to me theal son he was a part of his father's family one day this son he didn't feel a part of that family and he said to his father father look look at how we are as children we claim the benefits that we have accept the responsibilities of being children or sons of who we're Sons or children of and he says give all that pertains to me something belongs to belongs belongs to me the son said father give me all that belongs to me father said you know what here it is here's what belongs to you and he left there in Luke 15 he went far where no one could see him no one knew him to do his things he didn't feel a part of this family maybe something happened in his life something happened in his life someone might have discouraged he seen something I don't know maybe there was a disagreement something maybe terrible happened in his family he left very he wasted all that he had he lost his time wasted his time and being there he get a little closer to his and that's what God wants of us brother to get closer to him some of us is hard to get close we're further we're the furthest from him but this this young man he began to get closer to home he got just close enough to see maybe the front porch he asked for work at his father's estate and then they they gave him a a job to feed the pigs and then he he came to himself the situation in which he found himself he looked all around him he found himself in the field and he said oh I think I'm bride it seems I'm a Son of God many of us have been and it's a process to become the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ but he recognized and he acted he didn't stay oh I know that I'm wrong and I'm very wrong I'm very wrong and yeah I'm gonna keep doing what no but he go he got up first he recog he was in a miserable State and then he remembered that his father had an abundance of [Music] bread how did he when did he recognize that when he there in the F he recognized who he was and then he began to cleanse himself he began to cleans all of that mud satisfy him that did because the food that he needed was a higher food this Earthly food it didn't have the taste he got up and said I'm G to go to my father's house and he got up and went and what happened with his father he seen him from AF his father was always waiting for him our J Christ Brothers W on us situation in which you're in it doesn't matter what you might have done it doesn't matter how filthy you might be what pigs food you might have eaten the Lord is still waiting on you because we're a part of him we're a part of him says is the rising of the Sun him being the bride being the the bride must appear because she is a part of him and she can only be the manifestation of all fulfillment of the entire Revelation now in whom will all the scripture be fulfilled will the entire scripture be fulfilled it will be me and you we Quicken that word she can only manifest him if you do something different from what the what the groom does then you are not the bride but we're beginning to be a part of that in that process because she is flesh of his flesh bones of his bones life of his life power of his power she is him the man and his wife are the same they are one the woman was taken from his the feminine Spirit from him and the flesh from his side there the D Dynamics and mechanics were formed the bride the spirit and his and the flesh formed the mechanics and the Dynamics please stand Brothers Perhaps Perhaps might feel like you're not a part of him maybe you feel like you haven't left something yet or still have to leave something there's something that holds you back to surrendering completely to God remember with something intellectual but it doesn't remain intellectual J Christ is not an intellectual bride a bride that acts prepare herself begins to take off this world the garments of this world here in Revelations 19 brother Enoch read verse seven and verse eight says she's been given fine linen to dress the bride or the groom will not dress but she has to dress herself she has to try that dress to say you know what I still need this I still need this other piece the sleeve doesn't go in yet what do I need to take away need to take from our lives and she's been given fine Lin to dress that's glorious and Splendor because fine Lin is the just acts of the [Music] Saints begin to act begin to act why do we don't just stay why am I in this situation why does God want me in this situation God want you to leave from that situation what you find yourself yourself in a good situation you can be in something better bride always gets better for her Gro not for anyone to see for church for her to be ready for because he's going to he's going to come for her he's going to come for her for her he's going to come for [Music] himself he will reflect himself in her she reflects him but maybe we haven't gone there maybe something is lacking we left God a long time [Music] ago maybe we think we're going with him and he's not going with us but we want to be ready we want to prepare ourselves because we are a part of him I am a part of believe that you are a part of him our heads Heavenly Father behold your bride here Lord your beloved although we know that we're a part of that bride a part of you Lord we know the dress still needs to be adjusted there's something that we need still but we want to take that action because we are your bride and your bride takes action begins to prepare she begins to to say Lord show me what it is I need show me I want to be ready come we need something that we're lacking we need to R ourselves of show us father show us Lord although in our hearts some of us might say there something you're La something that you're you're you're lacking to get closer closer to me I'm waiting for you take action get
