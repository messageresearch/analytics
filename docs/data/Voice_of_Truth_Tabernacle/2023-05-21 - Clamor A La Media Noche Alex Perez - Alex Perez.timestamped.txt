[24:24] Hermanos
[24:28] [Music]
[24:30] Isaiah
[24:33] verse 11
[24:36] book of Isaiah
[24:39] chapter 21 verse 11. this is
[24:43] in the following manner
[24:47] Duma
[24:49] mirambo says
[24:55] the burden of Duma he called it to me
[24:58] out of sire Watchmen word of night
[25:00] Watchman word of the night
[25:11] you're happy and thankful with God
[25:13] foreign
[25:45] it's tremendous when you see a man of
[25:48] God leave this earth
[25:53] there's a lot of thoughts crossing my
[25:55] mind now
[26:00] if I can give you something of that
[26:02] event we were uh presencing
[26:06] it's worth serving God
[26:11] when you give your life for this message
[26:17] and you serve the Bride of the Lord
[26:19] Jesus Christ our brothers
[26:26] and receive plenty of greetings from the
[26:29] brothers
[26:31] it was a very pleasing time
[26:34] to be their presence
[26:38] we'll be speaking this morning
[26:42] thanks to our pastor for the opportunity
[26:45] we're speaking on the coming of the Lord
[26:50] and for a subtitle I like to title this
[26:52] message
[26:54] cry at midnight
[26:57] now you know Church
[27:02] is a crucial hour
[27:06] it's a very dark time
[27:10] it's a place
[27:14] where if you don't have lights
[27:20] you may stumble with something
[27:23] it's very dark
[27:25] all right
[27:27] now the Bible tells us
[27:34] of two Watchmen four off sorry four
[27:37] Watchmen
[27:39] and there was a time brother
[27:42] where in older times
[27:46] you know the cities were walled para
[27:49] protection
[27:52] of the people inside the city
[27:54] and as you might know
[27:57] there was always
[28:21] and we speak of foreign
[29:18] [Applause]
[29:34] foreign
[30:35] but you understand there was a certain
[30:37] time when there was a Watchman guarding
[30:39] or watching the city
[30:42] they caused my attention and we see
[30:44] brothers
[30:48] because when the time that we live in
[30:50] arrives
[31:04] when the messenger of Rh arrived to the
[31:07] scene
[31:08] he came at the evening
[31:11] he came at the evening time
[31:14] he arrived in a time
[31:16] where it was late
[31:20] the Bible says
[31:25] it was an evening time
[31:34] ages
[32:03] foreign
[32:51] program
[33:27] [Applause]
[33:54] foreign
[34:53] more than two thousand years he's still
[34:56] living
[35:20] he presents Jesus Christ
[35:22] to humanity
[35:25] are you following
[35:53] he comes with signs
[35:56] demonstrando demonstrating
[35:58] that Jesus Christ was alive
[36:01] that's our Messengers
[36:10] [Applause]
[36:21] it's alive
[36:47] for the world
[36:50] but the world received it not
[36:53] are we good brethren
[36:56] let's go
[36:59] this messenger
[37:02] had a process
[37:05] it's like we all have a process
[37:10] many times
[37:12] because maybe God healed us
[37:17] in our lives and that's good Brothers
[37:20] you shouldn't stop them
[37:26] continue onward
[37:35] himself to the US
[37:40] messenger came for the United States
[37:45] give the United States
[38:34] and the entire world
[38:45] speaking in uh on a global scale
[39:00] or his miracles
[39:04] for what he was doing
[39:08] when the messenger arrives at the
[39:11] evening time
[39:13] his purpose was only this is sometimes
[39:52] let's continue
[39:55] the years go by
[39:58] yesterday and this messenger
[40:02] is
[40:06] you know this messenger was evolving see
[40:09] yes
[40:17] and not advancing there's a problem
[40:21] we must advance
[40:23] foreign
[41:07] and this nation getting darker
[41:11] that's tremendous
[41:27] they
[41:30] saw the signs
[41:34] but they never saw the sign
[41:40] is
[41:51] Jesus Christ
[41:57] the Masonic sign
[42:01] Beyond brothers
[42:14] or more is happening
[42:19] but nobody wants to testify what's
[42:22] happening I don't know
[42:28] and we're sleeping here in church
[42:52] follow him
[42:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[42:58] we're not guided
[43:01] if I let myself by emotions I would not
[43:05] be here see yes
[43:07] reach it
[43:09] is
[43:11] because many things are happening out
[43:14] there
[43:16] there's testimonies to die brother
[43:22] there has to be a service of testimonies
[43:25] for someone to testify what God is we're
[43:28] just going to leave
[43:36] this Prophet notices
[43:42] that humanity is turned into complete
[43:45] darkness
[43:48] the time comes to the life of this
[43:51] Prophet Deke
[43:56] he identifies with something else
[44:02] see you should be identifying
[44:05] the same word of God
[44:21] de dios
[44:23] the Genesis
[44:25] go ahead and I said surely there's
[44:27] something in this word of God from
[44:28] Genesis to Revelation amen
[44:31] he wants to identify
[44:35] it was getting later
[44:38] it was
[44:40] it was getting
[44:44] darker
[44:46] and this word of God from Genesis to
[44:48] Revelation
[44:51] that's some character in there
[44:56] that you dealt with amen
[45:02] God was dealing with the prophets
[45:10] would be on the same basis that would be
[45:13] my question
[45:22] where people got tired of Miracles
[45:42] you know that right
[45:47] you know many people we answer questions
[45:49] what are you doing
[45:56] bring healing to the people
[45:58] that's what God called you foreign
[46:15] if somebody done something
[46:18] and you got after them
[46:27] then let me turn to that place in the
[46:29] Bible
[46:30] and if somebody
[46:32] listen
[46:36] whatever they done is
[46:42] don't fall asleep
[46:50] foreign
[47:13] [Music]
[47:16] foreign
[47:52] sir
[47:54] this is tremendous right
[47:57] I continue reading
[49:02] estamos look foreign
[49:05] [Music]
[50:01] [Music]
[50:05] do you notice there was a greater
[50:08] message
[50:11] I find out brother
[50:15] and I see what the scripture
[50:19] is
[50:23] heard at midnight
[50:28] is
[50:31] such a dark time look
[50:36] Quando
[50:38] meaning
[50:39] in 1963
[50:45] a couple of months before 1963.
[50:50] because you know the story
[50:53] foreign
[51:06] and he feels discouraged
[51:11] because for that time
[51:14] a lot of people abandon him
[51:20] he puts himself for example of the
[51:23] Apostle Paul
[51:26] and the ones that follow the Apostle
[51:29] Paul
[51:30] saw him in prison
[51:34] and said sir this is a messenger for us
[51:38] and present
[51:49] means to explain the present state of
[51:51] his ministry
[51:54] came where they said is this all means
[51:59] um
[52:32] the problem with us is we don't keep
[52:34] eating
[53:23] amen amen
[53:28] would die
[53:30] an explosion an explosion all of that
[53:34] you know
[53:36] 1963 comes
[53:38] and God reveals
[53:45] and this Revelation
[53:48] comes at a time watch
[53:53] poreso
[53:55] la venida del Senor that's why the
[53:58] coming of the Lord is a secret
[54:01] man
[54:03] it's a secret brother is
[54:10] a secret not everyone knows about it but
[54:14] there are people that do Hallelujah
[54:26] the
[54:29] Mysteries
[54:30] since the beginning
[54:36] [Music]
[54:59] tree of God revealed
[55:05] stick to us Church
[55:08] we're not only founded under a church
[55:32] the Seven Seals come
[55:36] and they come at a time
[55:40] where it was completely dark look
[55:47] one year later in 1964
[55:54] Diego
[55:59] a pope goes to Jerusalem for the first
[56:02] time
[56:04] sexto
[56:08] um Paul VI
[56:11] he was a Roman Pope
[56:14] and Jerusalem Este Papa and while this
[56:17] Pope is in Jerusalem
[56:19] you can see this here
[56:23] this morning at this message
[56:36] science cannot explain
[56:40] how to recognize
[56:45] message
[56:55] this message is the truth
[57:02] something Supernatural
[57:21] come on foreign
[57:42] this gets me excited
[57:48] 1964 the pope arrives
[57:50] and you know it
[57:54] there's an eclipse
[57:58] donde
[58:01] La Lunas
[58:04] where the Moon is completely dark
[58:08] Ness
[58:10] explains to us and tells us
[58:17] [Music]
[58:20] look brother
[58:23] we are living
[58:26] in such a Dark Age where brother Branham
[58:29] says
[58:31] that you would stretch your hands
[58:35] and it'd be so dark you cannot see your
[58:37] own Palm
[58:41] that is where the bride is in that age
[58:44] we are living
[58:48] presently in that time
[58:51] but just because we're in that age does
[58:55] not mean
[58:56] you should be in complete darkness
[59:04] ancient times when Moses was here the
[59:07] Bible says
[59:09] Darkness over Egypt right
[59:18] total darkness is
[59:39] completely
[59:51] foreign
[59:53] to a total darkness in seven stages
[59:56] watch
[1:00:00] where we are
[1:00:02] brothers we're past midnight
[1:00:07] I said we're past midnight
[1:00:13] the message opened in 1963.
[1:00:17] there was a cry there
[1:00:19] I said there was a cry
[1:00:22] um
[1:00:29] so study your message
[1:00:35] everything's gone 1963
[1:00:46] thanks to God for this message
[1:01:13] Pride
[1:01:21] is the truth
[1:01:25] that's okay
[1:01:27] they help pay for the buildings
[1:01:38] by a prophet to his bride
[1:01:48] [Music]
[1:01:53] it was a dark time
[1:01:57] brother Branham says
[1:02:07] you know the church
[1:02:15] not the messages he preached in 1960. do
[1:02:19] you say
[1:02:20] even that's God he is
[1:02:32] indicating that this was the truth
[1:02:35] don't you realize
[1:02:39] why are you looking for more Vindication
[1:02:42] right we get excited with other things
[1:02:44] many times
[1:02:48] and we get more excited
[1:02:53] with this there's something wrong
[1:02:56] Hallelujah
[1:03:14] foreign
[1:04:14] Born Again hallelujah hallelujah
[1:04:18] I must continue
[1:04:32] the church and parentheses
[1:04:37] went into total darkness
[1:04:43] This Is the End
[1:04:45] is this generation
[1:04:48] shall not pass
[1:04:53] away until all be fulfilled
[1:04:56] and he continues saying amen he finishes
[1:05:02] come quickly
[1:05:09] you know I had to come into darkness
[1:05:13] no
[1:05:16] because the Tao doesn't have the
[1:05:18] smallest
[1:05:20] see how God is
[1:05:24] revealing himself to his brother
[1:05:27] in total darkness
[1:05:30] God doesn't want the devil to know
[1:05:33] anything
[1:05:34] now God is revealing himself
[1:05:36] individually
[1:05:39] you know even the weddings
[1:05:50] I was hearing a passage God bless him he
[1:05:55] said
[1:05:59] be married with his brother
[1:06:02] I said all these fellas
[1:06:09] every time
[1:06:15] secretly
[1:06:31] hidden yeah
[1:06:35] I see the life of our prophets
[1:06:38] and how it Advanced
[1:06:40] how it advances
[1:06:50] and you know he saved a lot of people
[1:06:53] for the message
[1:06:57] this is okay
[1:07:03] he came for a greater purpose
[1:07:08] in a dark time
[1:07:11] he came brother
[1:07:16] to unite La Novia the bride conun with
[1:07:20] the groom
[1:07:22] is
[1:07:24] I have quotes brother
[1:07:29] we were that body
[1:07:35] that Jesus Christ's ahead was not
[1:07:37] complete without his body
[1:07:42] a couple Services ago the fastest
[1:08:15] that's me
[1:09:05] this is why
