rest of my life amen amen you may take your seats Brothers you have some specials tonight God bless you all I'm gonna try and be short and sweet um every time I've gone to Camp it's been a beautiful experience I've only gone twice but every time I've gone it's been beautiful I had a fight through a lot of loopholes to go this year I had a threaten to quit my job [Music] but there was a feeling in me that I needed to go I made it happen before Camp I was struggling a lot mentally I'm not going to get too much into that much I went with expectations and we got there it was beautiful service on Fridays but I felt my heart really really cold and I thought to myself you know how can God work with me if my heart's cold um so I sat on the sanctuary Friday night and I wrote a letter to God and I basically told him I don't want to leave this place foreign [Music] [Music] you can't control yourself control your body you can emotions and I thank God for giving me that beautiful experience um so I say you guys just continue to pray for me and for our beautiful youth because we need it [Applause] being that we have our brother Isaac up there I once heard this expression a blessing of God it's like if you're walking with 100 million dollars and the whole world knows of it and they're going to do everything to snatch it from you yeah and knowing what we know is we don't fight against flesh nor blood against powers and spirits and this camp for me it was necessary foreign [Music] I can say so much but um I'll say this for many for a while I was living off of a painted fire yostava viviendo de unfuego pintado and I needed a real firego verdadero and I believe this Camp was my real firego verdadero like our sister Madison uh I also was getting cold and I was lying to myself for a while that I was actually in front of a fire okay but like our Pastor said on Sunday Our Lives is something else back home and I truly can say you overrated this Camp was something I needed it's a company to rekindle that which was once in my heart I thank God for that and I thank God for that uh well opening up the way to be able to do this God bless you [Applause] um I know there are a lot of Youth come back with the experience of the worship and the preaching book where I felt the poll was in the other activities at Camp comodios how God moved through my brother commodious and how God moved through the youth here um as you know we're seeing plenty as being youth um and this time I was able to see how our youth let go and worship God with all their hearts and that brought me so much joy that were bigger than just any youth we have something to show and we did isilosimos yes and my message is more for the Youth you all have something special and God will continue using you he Hermanos and brother pray for the youths because we can't do it alone [Music] um it's something very special if you have the chance to watch the video and see how they worship with their hearts and you can see what we're aiming at he and God bless you God bless you Brethren um first of all I want to thank God foreign [Music] I could let go of myself and I remember on Saturday it was a final preaching application and it wasn't that much so the preaching ended but um and I couldn't hold back from going to the altars [Music] and there I told God all of my problems to help me uh um that's where I began to worship God with all of my hearts began to jump and dance something I never do because I'm very serious I don't like to attract attention but to the youth that having gone I recommend you to go because for me was a great blessing I feel closer to God and up to this point he's helped me in my Temptation [Music] and as soon as I got back the devil began to tempt mejor but up so now I've been doing good and I give thanks to God because I couldn't do it on my own and I want to thank the youth leaders for all your hard work and taking us and watching us God bless you brother [Applause] God bless you um for me it was something very simple I guess my experience at Camp experience um it wasn't like I don't know it's like kind of hard to explain when I was there um I I kind of went to Camp like oh I'm expecting God to move in whatever way but he'll move in me and so I had scheduled or put myself for a special just me special and they told me like okay you're like number three on Friday the first service and so I kind of got nervous and to be honest in the past I wouldn't really get nervous but this time it was kind of like I didn't know why I was nervous lots of people would tell me well like you have a pretty voice so what are you worrying about it doesn't matter how you do it it's gonna come out bien but I had such a worry inside myself [Music] and before going up as I was hearing the other two specials before meant I could feel the power of God through those specials especiales and while the devil would come in me and just tell me why why would you even go up there if they already God moved through them and the main thing that the devil basically was telling me was that look they can bring power through their songs and I was sort of Downing myself [Music] it's almost like a sweet voice just told me just like reassuring me okay just Resto so I didn't care what happened through the songs I just saying and however it came out if nobody received from the crowd I received and so I kind of just held on to that assurance and so on Saturday um I I just you know I didn't care anymore about like a guy or whatever so I just you know I would just worship however I wanted just not caring what anyone thoughts I just wanted to worship my God and so I'm really proud also of our youth um when we sing like the presence of God was there like you know and when you could tell like I didn't know what I was doing during the the specials and like one of the sisters were like man you looked mad when you were up there so you know the presence of God was just there and it was even confirmed that the Holy Spirit was you know whatever my own foreign [Music] I see the Holy Spirit and so I've just been holding on to that or Laura and I just want to encourage the youth it's implemented that don't let the fire just burn out okay even if you can't explain how God moves that little planted seed is um so let's just keep finding a good fight yes [Applause] God bless you brother I have to testify of the Wonders that God does um I was very happy and with high expectations to go and the theme was desperation and the new birth I remember brother Junior Reese preached Saturday night he read a scripture Jeremiah 12. it is it's a come with expectation to those camps so it's just not a camp aign so brother would say I know tonight God is going to change lives and you ask yourself sometimes you want to see something great and you forget that God works in Simplicity and he would say I know that's going to happen because God is the same God today he's the same foreign [Music] I'm talking about the Chicken and the Egg is with his beak special and he says a very special Peak was given to him by God it says that if the farmer tries to go and help him he says don't try to go help him because you'll kill it so I was saying Lord that is all for me to see that for my family for my children so he's he would say you cannot help them that's a person an individual's case with that special beat that he was given by God he's going to come in desperation and he's going to come out because he helped me there and he said plenty of heat and plenty of love and motivated um to help it and I said thank you because that is what I needed and in Simplicity that's where God spoke and I give thanks to God for that and God bless you thank you God bless you um foreign maybe I was going with the odd expectations I'm not sure how to call it pero condo service when we got there Services began from Friday when God's presence was felt it is and I was so happy to see the rest of the youth the Youth of the local church because I said I want this Camp to be for me I want to give the best of myself and as the theme was desperation and I wanted to be desperate for my experience is seeking the same I don't know that comforted me okay they're also striving like I am yeah and you don't feel like you're the only one anymore and I think Saturday night was when God spoke to me the most in me Lord I want you more in me I want to fill you don't understand where are you no says what I heard them say yes I'm already in you yes and that's a joy I'm from there and on I continue to rejoice and that's my testimony God bless you [Applause] [Music] I had been carrying a burden for about a year in my heart [Music] um or a disagreement I had with some people um foreign [Music] that time that this happened um [Music] I was struggling with my walk with the Lord already so this did not help me um [Music] to Camp with an expectation I didn't know for what but I was just expecting anything it was Saturday night okay they did an altar calling pero yeah when I stayed in my seat meditating and at that moment uh it fell on me reality is you always hear that you should lay your burdens on God trusting him completely is but it's so hard to practice he foreign but after that I felt that burden I had left and I didn't feel anything else after that foreign for a long time and it was just a good relief to have um I was a little scared because they always say the devil's waiting outside so that doubt came in in me this is confessing and confirming um [Music] and that's it God bless you [Applause] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] are we are we gonna open our hearts tonight that God has a blessing for us it's just up to us open our minds in our hearts I'll be seeing this song [Music] [Applause] as we praise he deserves the glory tonight you deserve and the order the Lord we lift our hands and worship as we praise your dream he is Great Brothers All For You are great you do Miracles so great there is no one else like you there is no one else like you for you are great you do Miracles so big there is no one else like you there is no like like animals [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] in the presence in the prison ers [Music] and God Almighty Prince of Peace [Music] of Peace troubles [Music] vanished hearts are bended [Music] presence in the prayer [Music] God bless you brothers and sisters God bless you brothers and sisters how many are happy to be here once again in the house of the Lord you know it's a blessing to be here once again it's a blessing to be able to enjoy to come to service you know I I believe that it was a great blessing not only to them but to myself and I make this personal medicine you know and and you know but the devil Diablo you know we'll always try to take away that blessing from me you will always try to take away what he gave you what you asked foreign and as a subtitle we've placed it catching his attention now if I can place another subtitle to that is why wait you know because sometimes we're in a state of desperation foreign if we can please open our scriptures to Psalms 34. and it says like this I pray to the Lord and he answered me yeah he freed me from all my fears those who look to him for help will be radiant with joy let's give um no shadow of Shame will darken their faces in my desperation I prayed in my desperation I prayed and the Lord listened he saved me from all my troubles now one more scripture in Jeremiah 29. says like this for I know the thoughts that I think towards you now I want you to look at that word for I know the thoughts that I think towards you say it the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an unexpected ends then ye call upon me that then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hurricane unto you to who to you to me on me and ye shall seek me and find me and as her brother stated in Camp there's only one condition because he says seek me and you will find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart is we give you thanks gracias Lord for allowing us to be here once again Lord I don't deserve I don't deserve your mercies I don't deserve anything Lord but yet you have me here with a purpose we have my brothers here with a purpose and Lord I ask that you may guide this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be Sierra brothers and sisters now the definition of desperation definition it's a complete loss or absence of Hope to lose or to be without hope to be hopeless how many here have felt with the desperation before I think we all have had a desperation in our life and if you haven't had a desperation well let me know the key is verse two oh sorry the second definition the feeling of being in such a bad situation that you will take any risk to change it now let me tell you tonight with God there is no risk with God you're not taking any risks and I make this personal for myself you know while I was in Camp um I I really wasn't expecting mucho I I was not certain if I was going to go or not but I ended up going you know of your free and the Friday service yes before I I before the the preaching started I don't just want this to be another Camp I don't just want this to be another day you know I want you your kiddo to help me get me I do this and in my mind I was like you know what I'm gonna actually pay attention to these preachings and Saturday night came along and that's that's when the Lord really touched my heart yes um because we we make it a routine brothers and sisters now we make it a routine to come to church Sunday Wednesday Friday Domingo but how is it that we're not in such a desperation for god brother Brown says you shouldn't be in a state of emergency to be in a desperation no desperation should be every single day this question shouldn't be to wait until until something bad happens and so Saturday night it was it was something different for me and I say this with my heart because um I really didn't care what anybody thought of me you know and going up to the altar yeah you know I I just left everything behind you know I just left everything and I was just like God it's just you and me right now God is just you and me you know so I talked to God you know and I believe that I will I received a blessing that night you know and then sometimes you could even say because the theme of that that that campamento you must be born again you know but even if you're not born again or you don't think you're born again the best that you're born again confess that you received your Holy Spirit and that's what it is that's what we have to do is to confess to confess what God has given us you know and and and and sometimes like I said Sundays Wednesdays and Fridays come along and as our brother said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over and over again with no results how many here have gone through that you know and as as is in Psalms 34 you know David found himself in such a desperation because trying to capture him you know but then he makes a song for what for when he says in my desperation I prayed and the Lord listened yes how many here pray every single day how many here meditate on him every single day you know another example is for example is The Story of Lazarus I like to read this quote then Jesus came and called first day pass second day pass Third Day passed the man was already running in his grave yes had already fell in and it's already rottening his flesh had gone back to the dust it was going back his soul was four days journey somewhere from him all hopes of ever seeing him again in this life was gone and then when all hopes was gone they waited maybe he'll come the first day second day then he died he hadn't come yeah the desperation set in La this is my brothers and sisters don't wait till the desperation comes to ask for God to ask God you know we should always be in a desperation every single day we shouldn't have to wait till the troubles come we shouldn't have to wait till the worries we should always be in a state of desperation and the message desperations he says I've heard people when when they know they were dying and the things that they kept secret all their life they in desperation they were trying to confess and try and take this and that and make it right go please go dot see in desperation they ought to have done that beforehand see now wait till the time of emergency will you do so and so for me the emergency causes desperation when we ought to do it without being in the state of emergency and I believe that God blesses us when we go into a state of desperation looking for him asking more of him I believe us youth we received a blessing at campus I believe we did but the devil is always going to try and take that blessing away let me tell you he hasn't stopped till after after I left campus my head started hurting I started to go sit down with her I really received a blessing but let me tell you if you believe in a god you believe in An Almighty God the power um then what wouldn't he do for me you know we really have to make a personal presence you know we have to go into a state of desperation we have to be looking for him day and night and is it easy yes I I'll be honest I don't do it every single day you know but there's something inside of me that tells me I have to keep going I can't give up I want God to use me in the same message aspirations he says now I believe that we're living in the days that we're otherwise the days that we're living in should cause the church to go into a completely into a desperation is now I want you to make this personal tonight I believe since the message this morning I believe since the message the last Sunday that brother of Titus preached this is I believe since Wednesday I believe it ought to throw this entire congregation into a desperation that we have played long enough that we have played long enough we've went to church long enough we've got to do something we need to do something for God don't wait for another Camp to come don't wait for the right moment to come wait for the moment the day can be your day and sometimes we need to completely give ourselves out yeah we got to do something we got to do something for the glory of God we can stay in the same condition we can stay in this run condition if I can put it this way you know but I believe it also requires a little bit of Faith you know it's your faith it's your belief that Jesus that Jesus did something for you you know why don't you ask yourself this question tonight I leave my brother uh not a question not a question a statement um Lord I need you to come into my life thank you [Applause] Elizabeth God bless you Brothers before beginning I'd like to thank Como David [Music] the heart to leave your homes the life of a Christian has become a person takes it lightly I was thinking of meditating on the theme a little bit I'm going to be answering it to my message you can't do anything yeah you can do something as well and Jesus passed by it hit me in my heart that they strive to enter [Applause] [Music] nobody want to draw near to me God in you the signs of his coming should drive every member of Christ to despair now for our souls Brothers I see the church very calm I see them very cold that's fine I won't force it is [Music] our well-being hereafter I don't know if you've caught this Brothers but why aren't we in a desperation for him because I'm thinking more about myself I'm thinking more about myself than in the others says this is usually takes a state of emergency to drive us to a desperation kill yourself because that doesn't happen then we're just still on call one more day one more day in church one more week okay oh how miserable how miserable to live day by day is he said what good does it do if we win the whole world in the glory of God foreign things they say it says what are you living foreign will it do oh Brothers what are you living for eign what are we living for brothers there's something greater than that I'm going to be closing with this a job that was found there Joe Brothers he went through the three uh stages of Grace there was his justification he was justified there he was still a sinner [Music] the same way thank you a prophet says when he heard oh Brothers when Jacob heard that his brother was coming to kill him he began to win he began to cry death was drawing close to him that's not needed we go to it yeah let's control and he heard was coming to kill him he was approaching him [Music] but he knew
