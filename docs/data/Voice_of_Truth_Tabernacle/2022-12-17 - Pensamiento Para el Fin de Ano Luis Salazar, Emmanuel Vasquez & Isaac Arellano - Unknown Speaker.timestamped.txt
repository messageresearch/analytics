[20:39] man I just want to thank my pastor
[20:42] brother Tito
[20:44] just for giving us the trust in me
[20:47] my brother's here are brother Emmanuel
[20:50] and our brothers amen
[20:54] um if we can just open up our scriptures
[20:57] in this night
[21:00] to Proverbs 22 4.
[21:06] man when you have it may you please say
[21:08] Amen
[21:18] this says like this it says the humility
[21:21] and the fear of the Lord are riches and
[21:24] honor and life is
[21:33] amen
[21:38] Lord gracious Heavenly Father Celestial
[21:42] Lord we just want to give you thanks
[21:43] Lord
[21:45] we're letting us be here tonight
[21:48] and for allowing us Lord to just glorify
[21:51] and honor Your Name Lord
[21:55] hope my brothers and sisters Lord are
[21:58] you also
[21:59] and hope me and my brothers Lord our
[22:03] brother Emmanuel and our brother Isaac
[22:06] Lord may we just let ourselves aside
[22:10] Lord
[22:15] my words are nothing Lord
[22:18] yours are what matters Lord
[22:22] important thank you Lord just take
[22:24] control of this service
[22:27] [Music]
[22:34] you may be seated
[22:38] so
[22:39] as I was just
[22:41] um
[22:42] I was beat or I got asked to preach and
[22:48] um well
[22:49] I'm like a shy person so I'm not that
[22:52] comfortable with like just speaking
[22:57] but the Lord just knows what he's doing
[23:03] um I just want to speak about uh
[23:05] humbleness
[23:09] um I think that we are sometimes just
[23:11] need to just be humbled in life
[23:16] sometimes we go above ourselves
[23:20] and we just think that we're better than
[23:22] everyone else is
[23:25] that's not the case
[23:28] [Music]
[23:29] um
[23:30] I just want to start off by saying what
[23:32] humility humility means
[23:40] humility means forgiving loving and
[23:43] caring for others just yourself
[23:52] and then it also says humility also
[23:55] means letting God take charge of your
[23:57] life and whatever we can't do he will
[24:01] significa is
[24:10] I just really like this because
[24:13] if we want to be humbled in life
[24:17] we need to learn how to forgive
[24:22] um I think that's very important
[24:24] because every time we get spoken to or
[24:28] anything that just comes in our way
[24:34] it's really hard to forgive our brothers
[24:41] um I just want to read a quote from
[24:43] brother Brandon here and get the message
[24:45] humble myself
[24:50] it says and if you want to get somewhere
[24:53] with God
[24:54] never let an arrogant Spirit ever come
[24:58] around okay it's used
[25:08] um sometimes we have that arrogant
[25:10] Spirit come at us
[25:14] then we don't know what to do we just
[25:16] wanna insult our brothers
[25:20] and well brother Branham also says if
[25:24] they're all wrong don't you ever build
[25:26] don't don't you never build up a
[25:29] conflict against that
[25:36] Persona it says you be sweet and kind
[25:40] and then I like what it says here it
[25:42] says remember God loved you when you
[25:45] were in your sins
[25:48] it says and if the spirit of God's in
[25:51] you
[25:52] you love the other person when he's been
[25:55] wrong
[26:01] um
[26:02] we we sometimes just
[26:06] um
[26:08] let that arrogant Spirit just come at us
[26:14] and then we forget how to be sweet and
[26:17] kind amen
[26:19] um
[26:21] but if you really want to be humbled
[26:25] just like God worked through you
[26:28] but I'm just use you
[26:31] amen amen um
[26:35] as well I just want to also speak on
[26:37] loving
[26:39] um
[26:43] um as we read here said loving your
[26:46] brother yes they're wrong um
[26:52] sometimes we just don't want to love
[26:54] them
[26:56] sometimes we probably always want to be
[26:59] right correct
[27:03] um hello subtypes
[27:05] your brother may be right
[27:08] and you're just wrong and then you just
[27:10] don't want to love them
[27:12] you probably always want your way
[27:19] and um if they're wrong
[27:23] you just feel good about yourself just
[27:25] because you were right
[27:29] don't don't feel that Spirit now no no
[27:33] no no no no no no
[27:37] amen amen
[27:39] there
[27:41] it says here this is a key
[27:48] faith is the substance
[27:51] it says you see a man humble
[27:55] and loving and good to his neighbors
[27:58] this is
[28:05] and a good citizen a good fellow and a
[28:09] good man and a
[28:11] and a Christian man full of love and
[28:14] humility
[28:19] Christianity
[28:21] it says you watch that man
[28:24] says that's right he is good charitable
[28:31] long-suffering it is
[28:35] you can talk about him it's all right he
[28:38] forgives you
[28:42] don't make any difference to him
[28:48] Brothers Hermanos sometimes it's just
[28:53] something says something to us
[28:56] and then it just all of a sudden just
[28:58] wakes on us and then we just start
[29:00] acting like a bunch of um
[29:03] well just we don't think right at the
[29:05] moment
[29:10] amen he says you you can talk about him
[29:15] but it says it's okay because you just
[29:19] forgive you
[29:20] sometimes you just have to have that
[29:22] humbleness in ourselves when someone
[29:25] talks about us we just got to keep it
[29:27] humble
[29:27] forgive them
[29:30] and just don't let it do any different
[29:33] unto you okay
[29:35] just keep that same humble spirit in
[29:37] here
[29:47] then sometimes oh hey this is
[29:51] um
[29:51] we think we have humbleness in our lives
[29:56] but sometimes we we either fake it
[30:03] um I think that when we fake it it's
[30:05] just
[30:08] it's just really like I would just say
[30:11] it's more
[30:13] you wouldn't be able to love your
[30:14] brother
[30:18] why because it's on the outside that's
[30:20] your that it shows that you're being
[30:22] humbled
[30:24] um
[30:25] then when it comes to uh
[30:28] um when it comes to like an actual uh to
[30:32] be around one another
[30:36] Persona and then someone says something
[30:39] to you
[30:41] it may it may not seem like it hurt on
[30:44] the outside
[30:47] but on the inside you probably want to
[30:50] kill your brother
[30:53] and I think that when we want to kill
[30:56] our brother
[30:59] we just let ourselves not get controlled
[31:02] over by the Lord
[31:07] right there was this one preaching that
[31:10] I was listening to
[31:13] um it was by our brother I think his
[31:16] name was brother Fred Mullins I think
[31:18] Fred Mullen he says that the devil can
[31:21] use you
[31:24] just job's wife
[31:26] they hope when job's wife said why don't
[31:29] you just curse your God
[31:33] then he says
[31:35] then he also says that
[31:39] um that's when Faith started pumping up
[31:41] you know this was
[31:45] um he says you speak like one of those
[31:48] foolish um and
[31:54] um I think many times
[31:57] the devil starts using us
[32:01] because we let ourselves be used
[32:05] we don't have that humble spirit and
[32:12] um
[32:13] there's just really many other things
[32:15] that just comes against us
[32:19] sometimes we just don't see it he says
[32:21] this is
[32:23] um
[32:27] I also want to read this other quote
[32:31] it says
[32:33] you know people want power
[32:37] and really they don't know what power is
[32:41] because they really don't know what goes
[32:44] with it
[32:46] the Way Up Is Down
[32:52] always if you want Powers
[32:55] see how humble you can get
[32:58] um just get away from Mario worldly
[33:01] thinking and humble yourself before God
[33:03] apart
[33:06] and then you've got more power than the
[33:09] man that runs all over the building and
[33:11] makes a big lot of noise
[33:18] so see because you have you have
[33:22] uh bent over to conquer yourself
[33:27] and commit yourself to Christ
[33:30] to humble yourself before him
[33:34] that's really power it is
[33:38] now let me tell you in this night if you
[33:40] want power
[33:42] from God
[33:45] let's just see how humble you can get um
[33:50] sometimes we want to be on top
[33:53] and then Garth just brings us back down
[34:00] sometimes we want to be on top
[34:03] but we don't know how to act uh
[34:08] and sometimes we just need humbleness is
[34:13] the only way up is down
[34:17] you want to have real humbleness
[34:22] just
[34:23] just love the Lord
[34:27] um
[34:28] as well as um
[34:51] okay it says um
[35:00] it says
[35:02] so always
[35:05] he that humbles himself
[35:08] God will exalt Joseph
[35:12] he that exalts himself
[35:16] God will bring to a base
[35:19] he'll bring him down
[35:23] always keep humble
[35:26] and be little in your own side is
[35:30] says be little in your own sights
[35:34] don't think of yourself as someone great
[35:38] man because then once you think of
[35:40] yourself something great
[35:43] then that would just take over you and
[35:45] then
[35:48] when you go out
[35:50] you think you'll be something great
[35:54] but your in reality you're nothing man
[36:00] it says no matter what God does for you
[36:05] just see how much more humbler you can
[36:07] be all the time
[36:11] the more God blesses you
[36:14] just keep getting more humble all the
[36:17] time
[36:19] hey man sometimes we we receive
[36:21] something
[36:22] and we just go out and just think that
[36:26] we have it all
[36:28] and brother says that's not the case
[36:32] can you receive more
[36:34] you gotta be more humble
[36:37] you got to be more humbleria
[36:42] amen amen
[36:44] just as you can get something uh
[36:47] physical in life
[36:52] and then you can go out and think you
[36:55] have everything already
[36:58] but you just
[37:01] just aren't humbled I guess at all no no
[37:03] no no
[37:05] you just won't be humbled if you think
[37:07] you're all this and that no no no
[37:10] even spiritually
[37:13] if you if you receive something
[37:16] you have an experience with God
[37:19] and you think you have at all
[37:22] but you also don't you don't have it
[37:27] man you just gotta keep being more
[37:29] humble
[37:31] in other words don't be a showa hey
[37:36] man just whatever God gives you okay
[37:40] just be more humble
[37:45] it says
[37:46] just keep getting more humble all the
[37:49] time
[37:52] and one more thing it says
[37:55] I like I like it when it says like just
[37:58] keep getting more humble or all the time
[38:03] God will continue to bless you
[38:07] as you keep getting more humbler
[38:10] he says he can continue to bless
[38:16] but when you get to a place that you
[38:19] think
[38:23] you haven't got it you're on your road
[38:29] says that's right you lose your
[38:31] influence amen
[38:38] um I'm gonna be closing now and
[38:42] um
[38:43] I just want to read this verse in this
[38:46] last quote here
[38:49] it says in Luke 14 11
[38:53] says for whoever exalted himself
[38:58] go ahead shall be abased and he that
[39:02] humbleth himself shall be exalted
[39:11] then it also says in the in the same
[39:14] message says you show me a church that's
[39:18] humble he says
[39:23] not an arrogant church
[39:26] just a sweet Humble Church
[39:31] I'll show you a church that has the
[39:33] favor and the power of God
[39:38] he says that's right
[39:40] that's the thing it takes
[39:43] humility
[39:45] humbling ourselves before God and
[39:48] letting God just work through us
[39:51] don't have to make a lot of noise
[39:55] and then you don't have to make a lot of
[39:57] noise
[39:58] all you got to do is just keep humble
[40:02] vendiga
[40:16] [Applause]
[40:25] God bless you brothers and sisters
[40:31] saying more on we chose our brother Luis
[40:35] is preaching for that again
[40:41] I feel like we need humbleness to even
[40:44] listening
[40:47] to even talk up here
[40:51] I remember uh last Wednesday
[40:56] you know I was like feeling ill uh
[41:01] and I I see that I get a text from
[41:04] Brother
[41:07] telling me if I'm ready
[41:10] you know I told him yeah but I am
[41:13] feeling better
[41:16] for a minute there my sickness did go
[41:19] away
[41:21] and then I came back
[41:26] uh
[41:27] no I think God sent me that sickness
[41:30] because
[41:31] I didn't know what I was gonna say up
[41:34] here
[41:36] you know a couple days later
[41:40] about Jonah
[41:43] and I read his story and
[41:46] I feel like all of us have a piece of
[41:49] him
[41:53] stand up
[41:55] yeah or and if you could turn to your
[42:00] scriptures on Jonah 1.
[42:05] verse one two
[42:09] one four one
[42:11] verse oh
[42:16] no no
[42:18] and may you say Amen when you have it
[42:23] now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah
[42:29] the son of amiti
[42:31] saying arise go to Nineveh that great
[42:35] City and cry against it for their
[42:38] wickedness has come up before me
[42:50] is
[43:00] but Jonah rose up to flee into tart
[43:04] tarshis
[43:05] and from the presence of the Lord and
[43:08] went and down to Joppa and he found a
[43:11] ship to go to tarshis so he paid the
[43:14] fare thereof and went down into it to go
[43:18] with them and to tarshis from the
[43:20] presence of the Lord
[43:38] you may take your seats
[43:43] as you see here that Jonah was called to
[43:46] go to Nineveh
[43:50] and speak his word
[43:53] but instead of doing that he went as far
[43:56] as he could but I said
[44:00] I feel like a lot of us
[44:05] being caught for something
[44:08] and we just run from it
[44:12] and uh
[44:16] you know sometimes we run to to word to
[44:20] which is
[44:23] to money to just the world
[44:28] we just try to get as far as way as it
[44:30] could
[44:33] and uh I don't think that's fair for God
[44:39] sometimes he has to send a storm to us
[44:42] just to get us back
[44:48] and when that doesn't work he sends a
[44:51] big fish
[44:54] that's right
[44:56] no as uh Jonah was in that fish for
[44:58] three days and three nights
[45:03] he cried out a prayer for God
[45:08] pretty much repenting himself
[45:13] and uh
[45:15] as he was repenting
[45:19] it doesn't tell us why he ran away from
[45:21] Nineveh yet no this is
[45:26] and uh
[45:30] you know uh
[45:31] God that's spoken to the fish to vomit
[45:34] him up
[45:40] and uh brother Brandon says that
[45:43] he says that Nineveh was a place of
[45:46] millions of people
[45:50] and he had to bring the word to that is
[45:57] when I first read uh Jonah
[46:01] it was like a long time ago
[46:04] I thought he was uh just because he was
[46:07] afraid
[46:11] but that wasn't the case
[46:14] I think he was just being selfish
[46:19] because it says
[46:21] that he knew that God was merciful and
[46:26] he was graceful
[46:29] and that kind of made me laugh when I
[46:31] first read that yes
[46:36] how would you not want her to be
[46:38] merciful
[46:39] he just saved you from that fish right
[46:42] there
[46:45] no
[46:47] and you know what we run from him
[46:51] and we run to the devil with open arms
[46:58] and the devil loves to pervert yes
[47:03] you know there's like schools in Ohio
[47:05] escuelas in Ohio that have uh satanic
[47:09] clubs
[47:11] crazy how the devil just works his way
[47:14] in anything
[47:19] you know I did go to a Christian School
[47:25] and even there you can run from the
[47:27] devil yeah that again and even there you
[47:30] can run from there yeah
[47:33] you could run to the you go to the
[47:36] restroom and nine times out of 10.
[47:40] you know there'd be like smoke coming
[47:42] out of a stallion
[47:46] not because they were a fire but no
[47:49] we're smoking uh
[47:52] I wasn't like seventh grade
[47:55] this girl in my class yes
[47:58] was giving a kid from the 11th grade
[48:02] beer
[48:05] alcohol that just shows that you can't
[48:08] run from the devil
[48:09] [Music]
[48:12] no he can run from God
[48:20] foreign
[49:09] [Music]
[49:27] 9 11 came
[49:33] and they
[49:35] made like bigger fences
[49:41] no no only people with
[49:44] with papers and come true
[49:49] and I feel like that's how we are with
[49:51] God
[49:54] now first we put a pile of rocks
[50:02] then we only let
[50:05] like prizes and things he'll give us
[50:11] they shouldn't be like that though
[50:14] it should be open right
[50:24] no uh when uh
[50:26] came to Nineveh
[50:29] and when he preached his word
[50:34] the prophet said it was so great
[50:37] everybody humbled themselves and they
[50:41] all were like sackcloths
[50:48] it's an issue and even the cows Forum
[50:51] yeah
[50:55] Jonah was so mad
[50:59] he asked God to kill him
[51:03] no I thought that was like so crazy to
[51:06] me
[51:10] God just use it to save a hole
[51:15] who plays full of millions of people
[51:19] the personas and uh
[51:24] and you just want to be killed you use
[51:32] Nineveh was a capital of Syria
[51:41] and Assyria was pretty much Israel's
[51:43] enemy
[51:47] and you know when I first read that yes
[51:52] that's why I thought Jonah was scared to
[51:54] go foreign
[52:01] no
[52:03] I like to read a quote from the prophet
[52:07] is
[52:10] and it goes like this
[52:14] look at the prophets
[52:16] look at Jonah when he was on the road to
[52:19] Nineveh and taken a boat to tarshis
[52:27] he disobeyed God
[52:30] and he was thrown out of the ship and a
[52:34] well swallowed him foreign
[52:46] and he gave his prophecy so much
[52:49] professor
[52:52] with a city the size of Saint Louis
[52:53] Missouri
[52:58] over a million population
[53:02] some of them didn't even know
[53:06] right and left hand is
[53:13] and
[53:16] the street screaming with this prophecy
[53:18] like that until the people repented
[53:29] in such a way they put sackcloth on
[53:31] their animals animales
[53:37] oh
[53:40] and I think that's how
[53:42] we had to Humble ourselves as well
[53:47] you know he had to do what God has
[53:51] called us
[53:52] here we shouldn't wait for that storm to
[53:55] come
[53:58] because that storm is going to hit hard
[54:03] and I know there's a lot of testimonies
[54:06] out there of people who waited
[54:11] and I'm not sure they would like to do
[54:13] that again
[54:17] but but sometimes that storm does give
[54:20] us
[54:22] character's character
[54:24] and uh
[54:26] I thank God
[54:28] Kevin gotten to that point
[54:31] where I've been hit with that big storm
[54:36] I thank him for taking care of me
[54:39] wherever I go
[54:43] from school from Escuela
[54:47] know from
[54:48] even 4-H which is like a program where I
[54:52] a program
[54:56] the 4-H
[54:59] you know even in God looks for people
[55:01] for character uh
[55:08] no sometimes when I search for
[55:11] for a cow
[55:15] I have to look how straight its back is
[55:20] how it works
[55:22] you know and uh
[55:25] how it's even faced you know
[55:29] like how its legs are
[55:32] formada no you like even before they're
[55:35] young you could tell how big they're
[55:36] gonna get I will notice
[55:41] just by looking like above their legs
[55:46] and that's how God looks at us
[55:49] at us and he sees how how big our
[55:52] character will get yeah
[55:55] and we always have room to improved
[56:03] our Prophet says that
[56:06] the end times will be like Sodom and
[56:08] Gomorrah
[56:10] I believe in that time
[56:14] and I believe we're in that
[56:16] [Music]
[56:18] and are we just gonna keep running
[56:20] accordion
[56:23] Arena
[56:28] no because we had to chase God it's not
[56:31] okay
[56:33] we shouldn't be running from him
[56:36] because there's a point where the
[56:38] running stops
[56:41] where that dead end comes
[56:46] you're either gonna have to choose him
[56:48] or the world
[56:52] in this little life and it's not picking
[56:55] Avida for eternal life
[56:58] some people say they're wasting their
[57:01] time
[57:03] it's just this big of a life we have
[57:06] instead of eternal life
[57:10] so what are you really wasting is
[57:16] that's right
[57:19] I just like to leave you with this
[57:23] don't run from him
[57:26] but Jason
[57:31] that's my
[57:33] that's my time
[57:37] and thank you for your time
[57:41] [Applause]
[57:50] God bless you Brothers
[57:53] give me a few moments
[58:03] how are you this evening
[58:10] I greet you in the name of the Lord
[58:12] Jesus Christ
[58:15] we're grateful for the opportunity
[58:18] foreign
[58:29] first of all
[58:34] I want to thank everyone foreign
[59:01] [Music]
[59:58] he brought us very much
[1:00:16] at the stop of running
[1:00:26] pillars in the church
[1:00:29] and not be a burdened
[1:00:31] your personal Mente I personally
[1:00:38] in Spanish because I feel like I say
[1:00:41] with with more with more feeling
[1:00:46] I know that I've been a burden in this
[1:00:49] place at times
[1:00:51] I've acted like a virgin
[1:00:54] maybe you don't know
[1:00:56] but I confess it is
[1:01:00] but for this coming year yeah and
[1:01:03] matrimonial in marriage
[1:01:06] as the prophet says
[1:01:09] matrimonious the pillars are the
[1:01:12] marriages
[1:01:40] we all have our New Year's resolutions
[1:01:46] we're going to do it we're going to
[1:01:48] exercise that's everybody's Federal
[1:02:23] hide anything from him
[1:02:28] [Music]
[1:02:46] without socks or shoes
[1:02:53] [Music]
[1:02:57] before you enter they asked if you had a
[1:03:00] heart conditions or cholesterol or those
[1:03:03] types
[1:03:04] you could enter into that place
[1:04:07] so said you struggled to wake up
[1:04:10] to get up to be on time
[1:04:16] but as our brother Eduardo says it's all
[1:04:20] in the mind amen amen
[1:04:24] we have to have our bodies subjects
[1:04:29] not the mind to the body yes so as um
[1:04:35] I don't know if that helps somebody
[1:04:40] but I took it in the spiritual sense
[1:04:43] because I have a problem
[1:04:46] that I don't believe
[1:05:07] at all
[1:05:09] foreign
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:52] [Music]
[1:06:08] it was just a man that was going to put
[1:06:10] on the horse
[1:06:11] he said open your arms everything
[1:06:40] at all
[1:06:43] you have to be in service
[1:06:47] service
[1:06:56] [Music]
[1:07:20] ready for service
[1:07:26] just judging on the thought of pillars
[1:07:30] so you can understand me
[1:07:34] I'll just let the prophet
[1:07:38] um express
[1:07:39] Philadelphia and he says in the in the
[1:07:43] Philadelphia Church you have it in
[1:07:45] Spanish yeah
[1:07:47] yeah
[1:07:50] they said now he is not only giving
[1:07:53] crowns
[1:07:56] but he says that these and the bride
[1:07:59] will be made pillars in the temple of
[1:08:01] God
[1:08:05] but what is the temple of God
[1:08:10] Jesus spoke of his body being as a
[1:08:13] temple
[1:08:15] it was the temple of God
[1:08:19] but now that we are his body
[1:08:24] the true church is the temple of God
[1:08:29] by the Holy Ghost within us
[1:08:32] now he is going to make the Overcomer a
[1:08:35] pillar in that Temple
[1:08:41] and then he asked what is a pillar but
[1:08:45] okay
[1:08:46] a pillar is actually a part of the
[1:08:49] foundation for it holds up the super
[1:08:51] structure
[1:08:53] is right
[1:08:57] yeah in English says superstructure and
[1:09:01] unless this is
[1:09:06] not just a building
[1:09:10] it's a superstructure so he says that
[1:09:14] puts the Overcomer right in with the
[1:09:16] apostles and the prophets
[1:09:22] for it says in Ephesians 2 19.
[1:09:27] for therefore now therefore you are no
[1:09:30] more strangers and foreigners
[1:09:39] but fellow citizens with the Saints of
[1:09:42] the household of God
[1:09:45] and are built upon the foundation of the
[1:09:49] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[1:09:51] himself being the Chief Cornerstone
[1:09:54] fundamento de los Apostles
[1:09:59] now that might have been a lot for the
[1:10:02] younger youth this is
[1:10:07] we are God's body here
[1:10:10] and God's body needs pillars
[1:10:14] we need people to support
[1:10:18] the superstructure
[1:10:21] God's plan
[1:10:23] God's body
[1:10:25] and that is that is my goal next year
[1:10:27] yesterday
[1:10:29] I I want to be a pillar not a burden no
[1:10:33] I don't know
[1:10:36] um
[1:10:36] if anyone has that same feeling
[1:10:40] but in closing
[1:10:44] we understand that there are things that
[1:10:46] get in the way and then
[1:10:50] the musicians can come you may stand
[1:10:54] there will always be there'll always be
[1:10:57] problems
[1:10:59] there will always be trials
[1:11:02] there'll always be battles
[1:11:05] but second Corinthians 4 says
[1:11:12] hi
[1:11:36] for a light Affliction which is but for
[1:11:38] a moment
[1:11:40] what you're going through okay what I'm
[1:11:43] going through is
[1:11:47] a light Affliction and it's just
[1:11:49] momentary
[1:11:58] working for us to far more exceeding and
[1:12:00] internal weight of Glory
[1:12:03] with every fight
[1:12:07] Gloria we we are we become heavier in
[1:12:10] glory
[1:12:12] Gloria you carry weight of of glory
[1:12:16] and where you're going through
[1:12:19] there's nothing too big for God
[1:12:23] there's something that the one thing
[1:12:26] only God can't do yes and that is fail
[1:12:30] and as our brother Emanuel said
[1:12:33] Diablo
[1:12:36] you came flee from the Devils
[1:12:39] Diablo you can't flee from the dead
[1:12:42] he will always be attacking
[1:12:46] but I believe as a soldier
[1:12:49] you should face him
[1:12:54] although the problems in the in the
[1:12:57] trials may come
[1:12:59] they may feel like War but
[1:13:02] there are warriors here okay
[1:13:05] although you may not recognize
[1:13:08] you don't believe it like
[1:13:11] Warriors here amen
[1:13:14] not only Warriors
[1:13:17] but for warriors or the Free World
[1:13:21] we are free in Christ
[1:13:24] and free Warriors
[1:13:29] and they don't have Rivals like our Lord
[1:13:33] Jesus there's no Rivals
[1:13:37] there should be no rival for his dirt
[1:13:39] his children
[1:13:42] and if you're not a free Warrior
[1:13:47] you can begin the Year Con Liberation
[1:13:50] with the freedom or Deliverance is
[1:13:53] we all need more Deliverance
[1:13:56] I need deliverance
[1:14:00] we need to Humble ourselves as our
[1:14:02] brother said it is
[1:14:08] with a golden abrush
[1:14:11] libres and crisps some free Warriors in
