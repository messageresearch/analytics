[35:37] is that okay yes we'd love to hear it so
[35:41] did you know that back when the Bible
[35:44] was written in the book of Acts the Holy
[35:47] Ghost came
[35:50] down I keep I keep thinking you're going

[36:04] okay see I have l in
[36:06] Spanglish it's okay okay I'm going to
[36:10] have in Spanglish okay that sounds great
[36:12] back and the
[36:15] AO fell down with fire and it changed
[36:19] the lives of the AP wow and
[36:23] then the Romans and the other Hebrews
[36:28] the the Pharisees they didn't like that
[36:31] Jesus Christ was being preached no so
[36:34] they would attack the Christians and
[36:37] persecute them so they had to share the
[36:40] gospel in secret can you whisper to your
[36:43] friend and say Jesus loves
[36:45] you say Jesus loves you so that's a
[36:50] secret now turn to the person on the
[36:53] other side and say Jesus died for your
[36:55] sins Jesus died for your sins
[36:58] Jesus died for your sins but the people
[37:00] didn't like it so then they started
[37:03] persecuting the Christians they would
[37:05] get them just like your pastor here and
[37:08] be like no be quiet be quiet don't be
[37:12] preaching about
[37:13] Jesus can you give your a round of
[37:20] applause nice and shiny okay but back
[37:23] then they weren't so very nice no no no
[37:25] no no and that was this one man there
[37:29] was this one man by the name of Paul but
[37:32] God had changed his name cuz before his
[37:34] name was Saul Saul of Tarsus are you
[37:39] ready ready here and you stand over here
[37:41] see the gospel why don't you have a seat
[37:43] talk to you the gospel started by one
[37:46] man his name was
[37:50] [Music]
[37:51] Jesus and
[37:54] Jesus he knew God knew that the world
[37:58] was full of sin and the only way for the
[38:01] world to be saved was if God himself
[38:04] came down and died on a cross so that we
[38:07] can be forgiven for our sins sir that
[38:12] whosoever shall believeth in him shall
[38:15] not perish but have everlasting life but
[38:18] Saul of Tarsus was a Pharisee and he was
[38:22] offended by the cross and he didn't like
[38:25] the people were worshiping this man
[38:27] called Jesus so he did everything he
[38:30] could to stop
[38:33] it hey that's messed up
[38:36] [Music]
[38:38] dude but he had a decree he had a paper
[38:41] that declared that he could persecute
[38:44] all the Christians so he got his little
[38:46] Soldiers with knives and swords and he
[38:48] went to kill the Christians
[38:52] but God had a different plan because you
[38:56] could kill the messenger but you can
[38:58] never stop this
[39:01] message oh Hallelujah as Saul was on his
[39:04] way he got encountered with the pillar
[39:07] of fire and Jesus Christ himself
[39:11] transformed his life forever and the
[39:15] reason you and I have a gospel was
[39:18] because God used this man to spread his
[39:20] word
[39:28] Jesus
[39:31] Jesus
[39:33] Jesus
[39:36] Jesus dwelle the of the godhead
[39:40] bodily he is the image the invisible God
[39:45] our Sabbath our rest the word made flesh
[39:49] Prophet priest and King
[39:53] you the the god
[39:57] Jus he is the image of the invisible God
[40:02] our Sab our rest the made
[40:06] FLH
[40:08] king
[40:10] [Music]
[40:14] sing
[40:17] enl
[40:19] Jesus the pear of great price marriage
[40:22] Feast must so accurate and precise Jesus
[40:28] the seed and the F with hidden treasures
[40:33] your labor Jes and the lamb The Great I
[40:38] Am from the dead he raised exalted and
[40:42] praised he raised forever there will
[40:46] never be another Yeshua ham the way
[40:50] truth and life so Paul he wrote the
[40:52] letters in prison and he passed it to
[40:55] the Ephesian churches Cor Church age to
[40:58] the galatian church to all the different
[41:01] churches and they went out and spread
[41:03] the gospel and one by one they would
[41:06] read it and it came to
[41:07] [Music]
[41:09] life blessed are they who hunger and
[41:12] thirst after rightousness for they shall
[41:15] be fil Jesus said to the world
[41:19] you're shining in the darkness a city on
[41:23] a hill
[41:25] Jesus taught us how to PR Our Father
[41:30] inen
[41:35] be
[41:38] [Music]
[41:46] am way truth and but just like that from
[41:51] generation to generation they would try
[41:53] to stop the word but father would share
[41:56] it with their son
[41:57] mother would share the gospel with their
[41:59] daughter friend would share with their
[42:03] [Music]
[42:04] friend
[42:06] Jesus mle worker to the winds and the
[42:10] waves he said
[42:13] Peace
[42:14] Jesus
[42:16] likeus the the lame and the
[42:21] leers
[42:22] Jesus the daughter of dyus the wiow son
[42:26] of
[42:27] he from the
[42:29] de the lon and the lamb great I
[42:38] Ames
[42:40] forever be another
[42:43] [Music]
[42:59] this was life to the
[43:03] Believers
[43:04] Jesus betrayed with a kiss sented to die
[43:09] by Peter three times T
[43:13] Jesus At The Whipping HS on a
[43:18] theed the
[43:21] Jes it is finished into your hands I
[43:25] commit my
[43:28] Jesus Des
[43:31] H principalities and Lucifer who fell
[43:35] Jesus Takes the and the grave setting
[43:39] captives free releasing the SL Jesus on
[43:45] the third day he up all power in his
[43:51] [Music]
[44:16] just like that it got to a point where
[44:19] the Roman Catholic Church was defeating
[44:22] and capturing and punishing all the
[44:25] Believers you declared to be a Christian
[44:29] they made you prove it oh they would
[44:32] feed them they would feed them to lions
[44:35] and bears they would burn their bodies
[44:38] they would do anything to stop the
[44:41] Original Seed the word of God from being
[44:43] spread from one heart to the other heart
[44:47] but don't worry because one fell and two
[44:51] would rise up they would take out three
[44:55] and then six Christians would rise
[44:58] like the scripture says 1,000 to my
[45:00] right 10,000 to my left but we know that
[45:03] the Living God will sustain us amen
[45:06] right they had something real yes you
[45:10] see this body this isn't real there's
[45:14] something even more real there's
[45:17] something even more real when they had
[45:19] an encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ
[45:22] that life came in their heart and they
[45:25] could face any trial
[45:27] they could face any storm they could
[45:30] face any bully because they knew
[45:33] whatever you say about me here can't
[45:36] stop me because God has the true words
[45:39] of life amen that's right and one day
[45:43] they were going to be with him for all
[45:46] eternity amen that's right but she
[45:51] wasn't quite

[55:20] Jesus says the Bible the Bible you see
[55:24] this is the word of God
[55:27] and when you fill yourself up with the
[55:30] water of the word of God then that
[55:34] changes everything there's a chemical
[55:38] reaction that happens inside you and it
[55:41] causes your body to react differently
[55:44] when the fire comes to touch
[55:48] you now this is the word of God that's
[55:50] the water now you see this right here

[56:17] in fact this is
[56:19] water she's spanked like a
[56:22] pig thank you sister thank you it is
[56:25] water and when the pressure of Life
[56:28] comes
[56:29] Cho and touches the balloon filled with
[56:32] water what do you think is going to
[56:34] happen well let's see let's put our
[56:37] balloon where our mouth
[56:40] is
[56:44] Pastor okay can you hold this
[56:47] please so we know that the pressures of
[56:50] this world are real brother Tito can you

[57:38] Lord oh my
[57:41] goodness all these little children's
[57:49] problems and when the fire comes see if
[57:52] he's not filling himself up with the
[57:54] word of God why and the pressure comes
[57:58] and you come with your problem
[58:01] [Music]
[58:04] againto like Felix I just prayed for you
[58:09] [Applause]
[58:13] yesterday that's right but you know what
[58:15] God needs people like
[58:17] Felix amen come
[58:20] on I didn't talk to
[58:23] him but when the fire comes if if he's
[58:26] not filled with the word of
[58:29] God I'm not going to do that to him come
[58:32] on you guys but I will do the other
[58:39] [Applause]
[58:45] one but praise be to almighty God that
[58:50] you have a pastor that is consecrated in
[58:53] the word amen that he reads his
[58:57] messages that he honors the Apostle who
[59:00] he called his spiritual fathers that
[59:02] where he got the word from amen so that
[59:05] when the fire
[59:08] comes and brother Alex's car breaks down
[59:11] on the way home from
[59:13] California when the fire comes do
[59:18] [Music]
[59:21] it
[59:23] wow the balloon cannot
[59:26] pop wow and if you don't believe me look
[59:29] where it got black from the
[59:32] flame let me explain to you
[59:35] why you look like your
[59:38] daddy let me explain to you cuz the
[59:41] water
[59:45] the the water it serves as a heat
[59:50] conductor right it conducts the heat so
[59:52] it spreads the heat out evenly so it
[59:55] does doesn't affect the
[59:58] outside now my question for you if
[1:00:01] literal water can keep a balloon from
[1:00:04] popping when the Fire
[1:00:07] Hits what can the water of the Holy
[1:00:11] Ghost the water of the washing of the
[1:00:13] word when it's inside a Believer when
[1:00:16] the Flames of Hell come raging what will
[1:00:20] it do but protect you from
[1:00:24] popping what can it do to a Believer
[1:00:28] who's filling himself up with the water
[1:00:31] of the word if you can identify can you
[1:00:35] give the Lord a hand of
[1:00:41] Praise but
[1:00:43] why thank you CH can you take it
[1:00:46] please thank
[1:00:50] you it's okay you can hold but why why
[1:00:55] because
[1:00:56] greater is he that is within
[1:01:02] me than the fire that's out there in the
[1:01:07] world greater is he that is within
[1:01:11] you then he that is in the world wow

[1:07:20] holy people in the Bible there was a
[1:07:24] holy people
[1:07:26] and they were called Israel they were
[1:07:28] the nation of Israel they were God's
[1:07:31] holy people and you know what God
[1:07:34] allowed those people to go to Egypt and
[1:07:38] there in Egypt there was this evil man
[1:07:41] called pharaoh and he had them prisoners
[1:07:44] as slaves working to build up Egypt they
[1:07:48] were oh it was a horrible
[1:07:51] bondage over here they were building up
[1:07:54] walls of Egypt
[1:07:56] over here there were building up statues
[1:07:58] for
[1:08:00] pharaoh and they stood up on their feet
[1:08:02] and they pushed and right here they were
[1:08:04] making mud so they can make bricks night
[1:08:08] after night day after day slaving away
[1:08:11] sometimes we feel like slaves in our job
[1:08:14] we feel like slaves in our
[1:08:17] workplace but God has a purpose for
[1:08:23] everything cuz he told him that there
[1:08:25] would be a
[1:08:26] deliverer for 400 years they cried out
[1:08:33] God deliver
[1:08:35] me God deliver
[1:08:37] [Music]
[1:08:44] me hear their
[1:08:46] [Music]

[1:09:17] Del Del can you say that say send your
[1:09:23] deliverer
[1:09:26] send your
[1:09:29] deliverer your deliverer but there was a
[1:09:33] man and a woman who trusted God and they
[1:09:36] had their children Miriam was their
[1:09:38] daughter and they had a tiny little baby
[1:09:41] you see Pharaoh wanted to kill all the
[1:09:44] babies of the Israelites so he was
[1:09:46] grabbing the little babies and he was
[1:09:48] throwing them inside the Nile
[1:09:51] River be care of it's okay he's my son
[1:09:56] but he would throw them in the Nile and
[1:09:58] the crocodiles would snap and snap and
[1:10:00] eat the babies snap and they would
[1:10:03] eating all of the children oh like
[1:10:06] sometimes I feel the education system
[1:10:09] and social media and the waves of this
[1:10:11] world are snapping up our children but
[1:10:14] there is a deliverer and there is a
[1:10:17] provided way and God anointed this
[1:10:20] family to grab that little baby and put
[1:10:23] him inside a box hopefully it was bigger
[1:10:26] than the tissue box that he's
[1:10:29] holding but he knew I'm going to put
[1:10:32] this baby in the river and God Almighty
[1:10:36] will protect that
[1:10:39] [Music]
[1:10:42] childo him you are
[1:10:47] Creator God you made the galaxies the
[1:10:51] deepest Seas the gentle breeze in my
[1:10:54] heart as

[1:11:04] words that we pray protect your
[1:11:08] deliverer precious deliverer our son the
[1:11:13] deliverer my baby deliverer be brave oh
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:19] deliverer our son the deliverer
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:27] I believe soon he
[1:11:30] [Music]
[1:11:33] will and Miriam his sister followed the
[1:11:37] basket in the river she wanted to make
[1:11:39] sure it was safe I believe
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:49] I thees of will never come
[1:11:55] promise
[1:11:59] Deliverance don't I
[1:12:03] believe and the princess of Egypt was
[1:12:06] there at the Nile and she saw the basket
[1:12:09] and she picked it up and she saw that
[1:12:11] there was a little baby in the basket
[1:12:14] and she thought oh my evil dad phoh
[1:12:16] would kill this baby but I'm going to
[1:12:18] protect it God always has a way of
[1:12:23] escape and Miriam is sister
[1:12:25] ran to her to let her know you know I
[1:12:28] have a mom and the mom can feed the baby
[1:12:31] if you want and the princess agreed so
[1:12:34] Moses's mom had the privilege of raising
[1:12:37] the son that she gave up mothers if we
[1:12:41] would give our children in the hands of
[1:12:43] the Lord the Lord will let you raise up
[1:12:47] your child in a Godly stature amen amen
[1:12:52] amen I shall call him Moses
[1:12:56] Lord I
[1:13:00] believe and Moses grew up and he grew up
[1:13:03] to be a smart man a mighty man he went
[1:13:07] to school and passed all his classes he
[1:13:09] did all his homework he went to karate
[1:13:11] class and he was like ha and he learned
[1:13:13] how to be a
[1:13:14] soldier and he was a mighty Soldier
[1:13:17] until one day he thought you know what I
[1:13:20] believe God put me in this position to
[1:13:23] be the deliverer
[1:13:26] and then he went out to where his people
[1:13:28] were working and he heard some music in
[1:13:31] the background because the piano player
[1:13:33] takes no
[1:13:36] breaks and he saw that the children were
[1:13:39] under
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:44] oppression help help
[1:13:46] me and he
[1:13:48] noticed that they were being mistreated
[1:13:51] by the Egyptians the people that he was
[1:13:54] supposed to deliver were being thrown
[1:13:56] down they were being beaten and they
[1:13:59] were being tortured and he got angry how
[1:14:03] many Christians have ever been angry
[1:14:05] when you see the enemy destroying your
[1:14:07] brother but Moses he decided I'm angry
[1:14:11] that's my brother I'm going to beat him
[1:14:14] up you don't touch my brother but he
[1:14:16] wanted to take his matters into his own
[1:14:18] hands but God has a different way poor
[1:14:21] Moses went up there and say hey you what
[1:14:24] are you doing to my brother you leave
[1:14:27] him alone are you okay why you
[1:14:35] just close your
[1:14:40] eyes wait a minute what' I do you see
[1:14:44] that what you do I I I was helping
[1:14:49] you because he shouldn't be treating you
[1:14:52] like that you deserve better
[1:14:55] no wait you deserve better you're a Son
[1:14:57] of God no no wait why are you looking at
[1:14:59] me like that it was
[1:15:02] M hey that's the last time I get your
[1:15:04] back that was him come here come here wa
[1:15:07] come here what did I do Pharaoh Pharaoh
[1:15:11] will kill
[1:15:15] me and he ran just like a lot of us run
[1:15:19] when we make a mistake we want to hide
[1:15:22] when we do something that we shouldn't
[1:15:23] do and when the fingers get pointed at
[1:15:25] us it's like but I was trying to help
[1:15:28] but sometimes the way to hell is paved
[1:15:30] with good intentions we need to trust
[1:15:33] God in all that we do poor Moses he ran
[1:15:38] and for 40 years he was in the
[1:15:41] wilderness for 40 years he thought he
[1:15:44] was a failure for 40 years he was
[1:15:47] getting older and older and he had a
[1:15:50] stick where's my stick can you get it
[1:15:53] for me because he went and he ended up
[1:15:57] being a Shepherd but if you know
[1:16:00] anything about Egyptians they hate
[1:16:02] Shepherds Moses was raised as an
[1:16:05] Egyptian and the shepherd was the lowest
[1:16:08] job a man can have that's the shepherd
[1:16:12] stinked a Shepherd didn't have no
[1:16:14] education yes a Shepherd couldn't really
