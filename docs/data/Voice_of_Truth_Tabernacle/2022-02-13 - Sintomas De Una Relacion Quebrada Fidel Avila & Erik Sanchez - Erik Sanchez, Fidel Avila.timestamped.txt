[49:14] follow me to the book of john capitolo
[49:18] chapter 21
[49:20] juan capitolo
[49:21] john chapter 21
[49:26] we'll be reading verse 15 16 and 17.
[49:41] 15 16 and 17.
[49:48] so when they had dying jesus said to
[49:50] simon peter simon
[49:54] simon son of jonas love is tell me more
[49:57] than these
[49:59] senor tusaves
[50:02] he said unto him yeah lord thou knowest

[50:19] simon son of jonas love is thou me
[50:22] pedro
[50:33] [Music]
[50:48] peter was grieved because he said unto
[50:50] him the third time love is now me
[50:57] and he said unto him lord thou knowest
[50:59] all things thou knowest that i love thee
[51:01] jesus
[51:04] jesus saith unto him feed my sheep
[51:18] restoring our relationship with god
[52:15] is not only caressing and kisses i
[52:30] our blood flowing in our veins

[53:47] and this is their first conversation
[53:50] between jesus and peter
[53:52] pedro
[53:54] after peter denied him thrice
[53:59] i imagine a conversation is long
[54:03] and hard
[54:04] for peter
[54:07] imagine
[54:21] the person that gave us their back when
[54:23] we needed them the most
[54:25] person
[54:27] but that person i said was willing for
[54:29] everything
[54:32] but in the most defining moment
[54:35] he didn't even say he knew us
[54:40] but see how beautiful is the lord
[54:45] because jesus did not sit to speak with
[54:47] peter
[54:48] to uh
[54:50] complain
[55:17] jesus christ
[55:19] [Applause]
[55:28] [Music]

[55:46] how curious the same amount of times
[55:49] how curious las mismas basis the same
[55:52] amount of times
[55:54] that peter denied him
[55:57] three times he denied him
[55:59] these were the three
[56:42] that they're crucifying
[56:53] his face was never the same
[56:56] he was
[56:56] afraid
[56:58] he was fearful
[57:02] for a moment they didn't know anything
[57:04] of him
[57:06] he wanted to go back to fish
[57:09] maybe he didn't want to continue with
[57:10] this commission
[57:22] what's the point
[57:27] [Music]
[57:45] [Applause]
[57:50] jesus
[57:58] [Music]
[58:08] and peter heard the most wonderful words
[58:13] that anyone that has failed can hear in
[58:16] juan mention
[58:17] in john 21 19 yes
[58:26] this speak he's signifying by what death
[58:28] he should glorify god
[58:31] and when he had spoken this see me he
[58:34] saith unto him follow me
[58:36] in other words pedro peter important
[58:40] it doesn't matter that you deny me

[1:37:50] he said the government had stopped the
[1:37:52] gideon babbles from coming into the
[1:37:53] country
[1:38:01] they went to court
[1:38:04] and the border is again open to allow
[1:38:06] our bibles to come in
[1:38:12] and they are still coming in today
[1:38:27] because jesus commanded us to preach the
[1:38:29] gospel

[1:39:13] gideon international scripture blitz to
[1:39:15] peru iglesias
[1:39:23] internationales
[1:39:26] i had to go through a lot of preparation
[1:39:28] before going
[1:39:30] to preparation
[1:39:32] i had to have a medical checkup and i
[1:39:34] had to get shots that i hadn't had
[1:39:36] before
[1:39:41] i had to have my last permission you
[1:39:43] think that was easy
[1:39:48] i had to send money ahead to help with
[1:39:50] the logistics for moving a hundred
[1:39:52] thousand bibles and testaments from one
[1:39:55] place to another
[1:39:57] mandarin
[1:40:05] video
[1:40:12] my itinerary was a 19-hour trip
[1:40:15] from denver to peru
[1:40:22] i would meet other gideons in dallas and
[1:40:25] we would go together for the rest of the
[1:40:27] trip
[1:40:34] well god as he often does had other
[1:40:36] plans
[1:40:41] i went to denver for the first leg of my
[1:40:43] trip and a big thunderstorm was
[1:40:46] affecting traffic in oklahoma the plane
[1:40:49] coming from me was cancelled
[1:41:01] well what do i do now anton says i've
[1:41:04] been planning this trip for six months i
[1:41:06] know my plans were out the windows
[1:41:14] so after a wait i finally got to an
[1:41:16] agent who said we can get you to peru
[1:41:18] through miami
[1:41:28] in other words my trip was now 48 hours
[1:41:37] so when i finally got on the plane from
[1:41:39] miami to lima ecuador
[1:41:44] miami lima sitting next to me was a
[1:41:47] well-dressed businessman from peru
[1:41:54] who spoke better english than i do
[1:41:58] i was prompted by the holy spirit to
[1:42:01] offer him a spanish testament el
[1:42:02] espiritu santo mejo que lo fresiera un
[1:42:05] testamento en espanol he said he wanted
[1:42:07] an english one to help him with his
[1:42:09] english
[1:42:13] i said you don't need that you speak
[1:42:14] very good english
[1:42:18] he said he wanted it to help with the
[1:42:20] big words
[1:42:24] i gave him one and soon noticed he was
[1:42:26] thumbing through
[1:42:46] the gps are god's plan of salvation in
[1:42:49] the back of the gideon testament
[1:42:51] [Music]
[1:43:06] it tells you how to meet jesus
[1:43:22] this is where you come in
[1:43:25] help me to stay out of it and not mess
[1:43:27] it up
[1:43:32] i also prayed that he was reading
[1:43:35] dear jesus i know i am a sinner
[1:43:40] jesus
[1:43:42] i believe you died on the cross at my
[1:43:44] place
[1:43:47] please come into my heart
[1:43:50] right then alfonso took out his pen and
[1:43:53] signed his name in the back of the
[1:43:55] gideon testament accepting jesus as his
[1:43:58] savior
[1:44:04] jesus
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:07] if i hadn't been on the wrong plane
[1:44:12] alfonso wouldn't have met jesus that day
[1:44:14] alfonso novera encontrado or conocido
[1:44:17] jesus
[1:44:18] suddenly i wasn't concerned
[1:44:20] about the long trip and i knew god's
[1:44:22] plan was more important than my
[1:44:24] inconvenience
[1:44:30] important
[1:44:34] peru is a city with a population of
[1:44:36] nearly 500 000 located in northwestern
[1:44:40] peru
[1:44:46] localization
[1:44:50] was the first city in peru established
[1:44:52] by the spaniards
[1:44:57] seventy-six percent of peruvians are
[1:44:58] catholic says
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:08] and they believe
[1:45:09] that good works are what is needed to
[1:45:11] get to heaven
[1:45:16] next slide please
[1:45:19] it is in these circumstances that
[1:45:21] members of the gideon international were
[1:45:23] called to share the gospel of our lord
[1:45:25] jesus christ in pura peru forever
[1:45:35] so i finally got to pura on sunday
[1:45:37] around 11 a.m finalemente
[1:45:40] mingo a la sonsa de la manana
[1:45:53] we met our translators and our team the
[1:45:55] next morning
[1:45:59] each of the international gains were
[1:46:01] signed to a team
[1:46:03] with an interpreter and two or three
[1:46:04] peruvian gideons
[1:46:12] we went to work going to classrooms
[1:46:14] universities police stations fire
[1:46:16] stations and to prison
[1:46:21] universidades
[1:46:26] [Music]
[1:46:33] myself and three peruvian gideons went
[1:46:35] to a catholic school that we thought we
[1:46:37] had permission to go to
[1:46:51] when we arrived the director said no
[1:46:53] you can wait until 12 30 when the
[1:46:55] students get out and see them outside on
[1:46:57] the sidewalk
[1:47:05] foreign
[1:47:08] since it was only 8 a.m and there were
[1:47:09] other things we could be doing
[1:47:15] i asked the peruvian gideons to call the
[1:47:17] local organizer to find another place we
[1:47:20] could go and not waste our time
[1:47:31] fortunately they took a different
[1:47:33] approach and call someone and they
[1:47:35] convince the director to allow us in and
[1:47:38] to let us give out bibles in each
[1:47:39] classroom
[1:47:48] director
[1:47:54] so now we are allowed to go into
[1:47:55] classrooms
[1:47:59] we could hand out bibles but not witness
[1:48:02] either vividly
[1:48:06] and we are escorted by none other than
[1:48:09] the director himself
[1:48:12] escorted
[1:48:14] nadia director
[1:48:16] mismo after we had done almost all the
[1:48:19] classrooms the director said we could
[1:48:22] speak
[1:48:23] in one class
[1:48:30] it was a senior class with all the older
[1:48:32] students
[1:48:37] i spoke through my interpreter joel
[1:48:40] about when we were children we sometimes
[1:48:43] tell something that is not true to our
[1:48:45] parents to our brothers and sisters or
[1:48:48] to our friends
[1:48:58] amigos
[1:49:03] and how we sometimes take something
[1:49:06] which we know is not ours from our
[1:49:07] brothers or our sisters or our friends
[1:49:11] or questions
[1:49:27] them no one taught them how to do this
[1:49:32] we were born with it
[1:49:35] it is built in esta compuesto por dentro
[1:49:38] i asked them who put that inside of us
[1:49:47] psalms 58 3 tells us the wicked are
[1:49:50] estranged from the womb telling lies
[1:49:54] says
[1:50:07] i said we could do nothing ourselves
[1:50:09] because we are all born with a sin
[1:50:11] nature.
[1:50:18] because it comes from satan
[1:50:21] and the only way to overcome him was
[1:50:24] jesus
[1:50:28] i asked for a show of hands
[1:50:30] who had already accepted jesus
[1:50:35] and sarah will raise their hands
[1:50:50] the whole time i was speaking
[1:50:53] beside me
[1:50:56] i then had my interpreter speak this
[1:50:59] press
[1:51:00] the
[1:51:00] interpreter
[1:51:02] who's a very young gideon and a good
[1:51:04] soul winner
[1:51:10] and he presented god's plan of salvation
[1:51:12] in their language
[1:51:19] when he finished he had the students
[1:51:21] that wanted to recite after him the
[1:51:23] sinner's prayer
[1:51:26] estudiantes
[1:51:32] as i look to my left
[1:51:34] voltami
[1:51:36] the director was reciting along with the
[1:51:38] students
[1:51:42] he had accepted jesus
[1:51:46] after leaving the class especially
[1:51:49] we all congratulated him on his decision
[1:51:54] [Music]
