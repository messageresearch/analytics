for [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Applause] [Music] your [Music] God bless you how many are happy I'm happy worship the name of the Lord Jesus Christ alongside with you let us open our Bibles to a book of Second Kings Second Kings we're g to be looking at a story here that will open up our our our our the theme that we will be undertaking starting this new year we want to start a new theme that we'll be uh getting deeper with God getting deeper with God Amen second Kings chapter 3 second Kings chapter 3 verse n we welcome everybody we hope that you feel a home you are in the House of your father you are in your house amen amen to see brother and S here everybody else Second Kings 39 just to open up the scene a little bit the king of Israel or the king of Samaria joined with the king of Judah or the king of Jerusalem they both United against the moabites they had rebelled against them and as they went to go fight against the moabites they went through the desert of Adam and as they went the days navigating through the desert they found themselves without water and many became desperate they felt as though they were dying because they were there in the desert or Wilderness without water and sometimes we find ourselves in the same way we find ourselves in a desert without water it hasn't rained we haven't received blessings from God we haven't received our healing we haven't received our deliverance and we say say what are we going to do verse 9 says so the king of Israel went and the king of Judah and the king of Edam and they fed the compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them and the king of Israel said alas that the Lord have called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of the Moab but Jehosaphat said is there not here a prophet of the Lord that we may inquire of the Lord by him and one of the king of Israel's servants answered and said here is Elisha the son of shafat which poured water on the hands of Elijah in other words let's seek God let's seek out what he has for us how can he help us and they found Elijah and they said he served Elijah he can help us as well that's right and Jehoshaphat said the word of the Lord is with him verse 13 says they said for Elisha and he was a little irritated he was a little irritated because first of all they did as they wanted to and then they remembered about God many times we remember God when we're almost dying yes and elishah a little irritated says what have I to do with thee get you to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and the king of Israel said unto him nay for the Lord have called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of the Moab and Elisha said as the Lord of host before whom I stand surely were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah so he was a little serious with him he says but now bring me a minstral a menst is is bring me some music bring me some worship so that I can soften my spirit a little bit and and it came to pass when the Minal played that the hand of the Lord came upon him and he said thus said the Lord make this Valley full of ditches for thus said the Lord shall not see wind shall you see rain yet that Valley shall be filled with water you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts and this is but a lightning in the sight of the Lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand you shall Smite every friend City in every choice City and shall every good tree fall and stop all Wells of water and Mar every good piece of land with stones and it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering was offered that behold there came Water by the way of Edam and the country was filled with water let us pray Heavenly Father we ask Lord that may be your presence with us your word with us your Revelation with us as we open our hearts we desire to hear from you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated uh getting deeper with God getting deeper with God last week I spoke with the subject uh wait stand up again get up again get up again stand get up again many times we have fallen right and we need to get back up and I said but the way to get up many times is go down because with God the way to go up is to come down with God I repeat the way to go up is to come down I will say this and I want you to write this down and I want you to KN which direction we're heading this is a theme we want to start with this year year and we need to understand this principle our capacity to rise or go higher depends on our capacity to go deeper I repeat many times we focus so much on going higher oh I need we I need to go higher with God I need to go higher and because since we know we're Eagles we want to go very high but I find out that with God before being able to go higher you have to be able to go deeper with him the capacity of a tree to be able to flourish or go or get bigger depends on how deep The Roots can get in the Earth but we many times we don't focus on that because it's something that's not seen it's something that's not noticed people can't worship me or praise me for I can't boast about it because when you go deeper that means the people aren't seeing that but I ask you this question Church how deep is your relationship with God oh coming to church everybody sees you how you worship how you sing how you will preach what about the things that people can't see what about your private life with God what about your prayer in your closet nobody else knows about what about your faith what about your Devotion to God what about your dedication sir those are things that nobody can see come on church we like to work in the things where everybody can see us we like to get better in the preaching get better in the worship but we don't get better on the things that people cannot see we don't work on the things that are that go deeper with God that's true that is true now look Ephesians uh 3:14 says he says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family Heaven and Earth is named he says now I bow my knees that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the Inner Man I want you to notice where these riches are found Church many of us are depending on the things that we can find in in the external but I want you to understand riches are found in the inside where are the riches of this Natural Earth they are found within the Earth say again Treasures are found within the Earth the treasures are in the depths even the riches is because somebody was willing to dig to work to make the work heart and seek those diamonds and seek that oil or petroleum riches aren't out there in space Church they're not up there in the clouds riches even of this Earth they are in the depths of the god hid them he says verse 16 that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love before a building can be uh constructed higher the foundations have to be very well of something that is strong and and founded well before a tree can grow higher it has to expand its roots to the depths no wonder Martin Luther said my Temptations My tribulations they forced me to seek God deeper I repeat Martin Lu how many have tempations how have tribulations many of us say Lord why do I spend so many time in church and I can't overcome I still have temptations I still have tribulation come on church or did you already overcome everything so those of you that overcame everything you just haven't realized how much problems you really have how many of us here are sincere and you say Lord I haven't had there things that I can't overcome and Martin Luther [Applause] say oh that just forced me to seek God's the the depth of God even even deeper when it hasn't rained when it hasn't rained the plants the vegetation seeks out the depths I want to tell you church I to tell you this morning it is time to get deeper with God I repeat it is time to get deeper with God look at your neighbor and say it's time to get deeper with God come on church we need a deeper worship we need a deeper love something that can sustain us through the tri let me tell you the storms are going to get more difficult the battles will be harder the waves will rise higher anchor that will go to the death they can withstand the they can withstand the pain they can withstand everything the devil brings against us your superficial relationship with God will not small oh Lord I love you that will not hold you that won't withstand come on church say I come to church on Sunday glory to God for that continue getting deeper with [Laughter] God because that relationship is not enough we have a superficial relationship with God we depend on the rain we depend on the rain we depend on the blessings of God but a Son of God that has been planted by God doesn't depend on the rain if it rains or it does he goes and seeks out the water he goes and seeks the goes into the depths of God Lu Martin Luther said my Temptations they forced me to go deeper with God if you say this morning brotherto God hasn't answered my he hasn't Delivered come on Church let's be sincere for a moment the church hasn't been enough to deliver me of this Spirit there's somebody there's somebody here that say it hasn't been enough present relationship with God hasn't been enough to take away the things that are hindering and I tell you Church go deeper go deeper with him if you haven't found him yet found your deliverance yet go deeper with him sooner or later you will find the Fountain of Living Waters that can satisfy that desire in your heart on one occasion God found himself with a Samaritan woman and you know God likes to find us at the Wells there's something special about a well something special about a well a good well it always has water a good well doesn't depend on the rain a a well that is deep doesn't depend on if there's a Revival or not doesn't depend on if they preach good or not a deep well it depends if there's not rain for a month there is still water there there's no rain there is still there's still Joy there's still happiness there is still peace come on Church some of us the reason we don't Rejoice we're waiting for the rain to come down that's why there is no joy in us because we're waiting for the rain to come down what are we going to do when there's no rain what are we going to do when there's no rain could it be that there's no more miracles come on church is there no more miracles we don't need rain come on church we don't need rain to find our God found himself with that Samaritan woman and he says and she says he said give me to drink she said why would you ask me for water I have nothing to give you sometimes that's how we are we have nothing to give the Lord unless they song Lead well pre well and then and then we have something to give the Lord and Jesus says if you would drink of the water right there is a water that never that never exhaust rivers of Living Water will come from your belly you'll always have something to give you always have a worship where do you get it out of Brother Where do you get it from song leer there's a deep relationship with God if my worship comes out of that oh I don't need a Revival give glory to God he ask me and [Applause] worship I don't need to feel good I don't need for things to be going I don't I don't need money in the bank I don't need my cars to work I don't need have enough for the rent there's always worship because there's something profound and deep there I tell you Church continue to dig go deeper your deliverance isn't some place come on Church the Holy Ghost is in a some God is not a liar his word is true you haven't found him yet deeper with [Applause] him your healing is there your deliverance is there Paul continues saying here Verse 18 I'll read 17 Again that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height verse 20 says now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think now look Paul tells them I want you to go deeper with God I want you to understand the the the the the length the bread of God or the W that's fine when we are converted to God we come to church we begin to know many things right we begin to see the the superficially the WID and the we just fill ourselves with the word we we eat the books we fill ourselves with knowledge to try to know what this is what that is that is the the width and the length but then Paul says but don't stay there now learn about the depths notice how he puts the depth before the height because you cannot go higher with God if you don't get deeper with him the word of God Is So exact he doesn't say height before depth he says the depth first say the depth first say the depth is first we want to explore the outer space and we haven't explored what God has given [Applause] us sometimes we think that the depths of God are complicated things that are things that are very complicated that's not what depths are about the depth is simply understand what we've learned come on Church the depth has to do with understanding what we've learned sometimes we learn a lot but we understand very little I repeat sometimes we learn a lot there are people that learn a lot and God bless them you have a good memory you have a good way of learning but they understand very little the Pharisees in the time of Jesus they knew a lot they learned a lot but they understood very little they understood very little what it meant you say I understand what worship is I've learned how to worship God but do you truly understand don't just talk about it don't just learn it by memory do you understand it we just simply stay with with one word of God and every day just go deeper with it let me tell you I do I do not comprehend completely I do not completely understand how it is that his blood has so much power if we would just stay with the blood of Jesus we want to run all over the place but if we just simply stay still trying to understand a little bit more in what God has put in our hands yes sir yes sir I don't completely understand brother uh Isaac I haven't finished understanding I haven't gotten to it complete understanding the blood of Jesus Christ can do so much for me do so much for you every day I come to service I say once again Lord your blood over my life every time I sin I understand it a little more understand his love a little bit more every time I worship him I don't want to worship just to worship just to I want to serve just to serve I want to understand what I'm doing I want to understand what he's given me Hallelujah so he says before going higher you have to understand the depths is that fine with you Paul said and uh Romans 11:33 all the depth all the depth come on church if that doesn't get you excited I don't know what does oh the de of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God oh if you realize that the riches of God are in the depths the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who had known the mind of the Lord or who has been his counselor or who has first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things him be glory forever amen in him is everything I need oh church if you understood that you wouldn't seek anything else you would just to go deeper with God to go further with him right Brothers we need to peel back the layers you know God has layers you know the word of God has layers says that there's things in the Bible they have a twofold they have a compound meaning a tri a three-fold meaning the the ministry of Elijah had was a fivefold layers the word of God has layers sometimes we just get to the first layer God is [Applause] love have you asked yourself what that means to to to to me what does it mean that he was going to send an Elijah in our time people read about it they just stay with that you would go deeper for you realize how much riches there are there it's time to peel back the layers to peel back the layers of our worship come on Church oh Lord I'm worshiping our mind is somewhere else you came to church fine that's a layer there's nothing wrong with that but peel back the layer peel back the layer Let Yourself Loose a little bit more begin to see what your need is to see what your worship is that's why God told God seeks true worshippers wor those that worship spirit and truth that don't worship him in the flesh or just out of emotion or for music worship Him in spirit and in truth it's time to peel back the layers brother Ro a worship is just not a superficial worship is not God doesn't want a superficial relationship with us that's right in the message God hiding himself in Simplicity Lord Jesus in the way of humility in the way of humbleness I offer you this congregation that's on their feet offer them to you because they have in response to the call they're seeking deeper things you know brother prayed for a lot of people and to many he would tell them you're seeking the deeper things of God and that's why God is answering sir brother says here they're seeking deeper things says myself voice through Tabernacle are you seeking the deeper things to love God deeper to experiment God in a more intimate way hallelujah hallelujah Brothers worship him in a deeper way to know him understand to know your God he continues saying they're seeking more life after hearing them that the blood of Jesus that there is nothing more that the complete word of God Rest within them it's fine to know that the blood saves you it's fine to know that he paid a price for you but that's not all of it that's not all of it there's a more consecrated life there's a more deeper experience there's a deep a greater worship Hallelujah says they're seeking the deeper things that the very command of their own voice is is creative power because in them is the Holy Ghost this Holy Ghost is a Creator makes things come to pass because he speaks the word and the word spoken becomes God in action and Lord I pray that you'll send the Holy Ghost upon every one of them just now and in the power of the resurrection of Christ the things that they are Desiring in their heart a better life the baptism of the spirit Lord may it be so why why is God willing why is he willing to give you more because there's somebody that wants more the Bible says he that seeks shall find but you have to seek it out I ask you this question are you seeking are you seeking are you seeking going back to the story from the beginning here is Elijah Elisha once again in the second Kings here's Elisha and he says chapter three he he's taking it here in stages he says I need a little bit of worship that's what we do we come to church and worship begins you need to enter into that Spirit of worship that Spirit of worship prepares you It prepares you for what is coming it softens the Earth you have to dig up later come on Church prepares the soil the enter into that worship with worship and Thanksgiving wor worship even our prayer Be Our Father who art out in heaven holy be name it begins with worship it begins with worship because it begins to prepare us but Elijah doesn't leave it there as he's worshiping I imagine he was worshiping I didn't think he was there serious I don't think he was there with his arms crossed come on I imagine that Elijah El I don't he said to bring a worshiper because he wanted a worship he wanted to enter into the spirit yes he he sent for a menstrual or musician because he wanted to enter into the worship brother brandham says in the message making of the valley full of ditches Spanish I hope sounds he I said so when the prophet was irritator upset and he said bring a Minstrel and the the the the Min began to play the hand of the Lord came upon the prophet and if music brought brought the power of God at then it will bring the power of God now that's just exactly God's still the same now the prophet you may not you may not be the prophet but you could be the Min you can be part of it anyhow to bring the power of God they started to pray and elishah got in the spirit and he saw a vision when he saw the vision go out yonder in that desert right where you're at and go to digging ditches dig them out for thus said the Lord you will not hear any Wind You have to hear somebody appla somebody sing there won't be any noise there won't be noise don't worry you're digging within you're working on yourselves you won't hear any wind or any rain oh Brothers you don't have to wait for the rain you don't have to wait for the Revival come on Brothers every time I come up here I have my Revival with or without you a true worship he doesn't need for the rest of the people for him worshiping God a preacher does it need for the rest of the people to make noise he has the joy within he has the Revival within [Music] him he said he says so you won't hear any wind any rain but there will be water that will come from the way of the Wilderness why where that water come from from that rock that smitten rock that was in the wilderness that's right was back there somewhere it might have been covered up I ask you is your blessing covered up can it be that you're on top of your your blessing you're standing on your blessing it be that you're standing on your blessing there was the his Blessing says maybe it was covered up why because it was underneath it was running underneath come on church but maybe it was covered up there was a smitten Rock in there that Moses smoked coming through the Wilderness and that smitten Rock still lays Yonder too to be touched tonight Waters of life and now notice they went without any evidence of having water the first thing he had to do was prepare a ditch for the water to come in you get what I mean my time I have to hurries to get to this point look the deeper they dug the more Waters they [Applause] [Music] got the deeper they dug the more water they obtained sometimes all it is is just a little bit of soil a little bit of dirt the dirt Upon Us Shake Yourself Shake yourself off a little bit shake off that Ang shake out the things of the world set them aside he says the more water they the more they dug perhaps maybe you you'll go in and and find a little tin can throw it out that's the guy that says the days of Miracles is passed just kick them out of the way dig on down there and then when you hit another one that says well I tell you what I believe these things are just simply a a psycho workout mental telepathy or something that's what they would say of brother brand that's what they say in these days it is telepathy psychology let me tell you it's not psychology not it's the spirit of God he is real he is more real than anything else more real than this world more real than what you can see more real than what you can touch he is so real get that out of the way and keep digging that's correct the deeper you dig the more water you'll have amen amelu the musicians can't come forward Jesus Christ said this if the grain of wheat does not fall into the ground notice how he says it has to fall into the the the ground it just remains but if it dies it Bears much fruit on in another Parable in Matthew 13 He says the same day went out Jesus out the house and when he seed his some seeds fell by the wayside and the fs came and devoured them up some fell upon Stony places where they had not much Earth and forward they sprung up because they had no deepness of Earth and when the sun was up they were scorched because they had no root they withered away isn't that so many times we receed something on behalf of God but since it never got deeper it grows [Music] quickly people can see that but what they can't see is how how weak we are within so the trial comes Temptation [Music] comes and it takes away what God has given us because there's no depth because our relationship with God Is So superficial so shallow it's it's just a relationship on a Sunday only or it's just a relationship like oh only when I go to church it's a relationship that can't withstand or [Music] endure I don't want that type of relationship I don't want that type of relationship with God I want to know [Music] him in a such an intimate way I find everything I need in him I don't need to find it in any other place all of the riches of his glory are in him if you would please stand in this morning I encourage you Voice of Truth Tabernacle stop [Music] playing it's time to get deeper with him it's time to have a true relationship with him it's time to know him understand what we're doing to know what the holy spirit is if we don't know what the holy spirit is we're just guessing that's all we're doing we're guessing we truly don't [Music] know the true power of [Music] God you say brother [Music] Tito it's because I'm waiting for it to [Music] rain and God says begin to dig begin to dig begin to get begin to meditate in me to enter into my presence to the point where you don't want to come out of there like that person once said Lord if you don't give me the Holy Ghost you'll find a bag of bones right here I won't leave here until I know you won leave until I know what the holy spirit [Music] is you say I've tried it brother Tito to come to church so many times has nothing to do with your time it has to do with how deeper you've gone can 4 years in the church truly know [Music] him how deep is your relationship with him how much do you truly [Music] understand how is your private life how is it what the others don't see could it be out here you say Amen but inside you're [Music] doubting oh I want to get to the point Brothers want to get to the [Music] point it doesn't matter what the people say matter what they hear me say what matters is what I'm believing inside my love for him my love for [Music] him how deep is your relationship with him you say I haven't found it yet him yet go deeper your deliverance is there church church was of true Tabernacle you that are still struggling your deliverance is there maybe it's just covered up you need to peel back the layers and find is what is deeper than it's
