is [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] we'll be speaking dilemma on our subject restaurant restoring the woman and we'll focus on our title gloria woman made for glory genesis genesis 3 15. and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his feet his heel forgive me let us pray heavenly father we come before you to give you all honor and glory lord because you are the only one that deserves it you're the only one that deserves everything from us or you deserve who speak on this subject it's very complex because it has many phases it has many sides or angles and teach us what type of bride god is seeking because jesus christ is the wedding supper of the lamb says so god sends a message to search for a bribe and she judges herself it is a senor it says lord what pleases you and what doesn't please you do you realize why we needed a message [Applause] better said proverbs 19 13. proverbs 19 13. a foolish son is the calamity of his father and the contentions of a wife are they continue dropping i believe that man although you don't have to okay but when there are problems with a woman i problemas there are problems and it's something terrible for the entire household but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands so we want to set the woman on the right place the woman has an important position in the body of christ [Applause] the woman feel good you were made for something great inside the woman there's something in her okay she was made for something great when a man comes and shows her how she can be great that caused the woman's attention follow me for a moment the serpent told her according to the message of the hour that from the woman would come the messiah now that was true [Applause] [Applause] simply change the story that's all he did the serpent tells eve look this is the way that you can bring forth [Applause] is she'll give you a meal she multiplies and enlarges what is given to her frustration so if you give her frustration they'll multiply and enlarge that if you give a woman um jealousy jealousy and vigilance nova it won't produce anything good from that if you give a woman jealousy and vigilance yes she likes protection if you give her jealousy and vigilance that is not equal to protection that will only give you somebody if you give her chauvinism they need to obey him and that's not the way we'll speak on that if you give chauvinism to the woman he won't she will let her let you guide her the woman was made to receive something from the man's behalf and give him something better a woman you give her an immature man and she will help that immature man the man and the woman need each other the woman helps the man yes or no hello needs that's the minimum but she helps makes him a better person how many here are marriages you don't need to raise your hands i don't want to get you into problems but you are a better man because you have a good woman that's right wherefore he saith the wake thou that sleepless and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee life desire to be enlightened no wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is and be not drunk with wine worm and wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit uh now after he says this yesterday verse 21 says this submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god we need to understand what we're doing that we should be enlightened believe that the word submit yourselves into your own husbands as unto the lord now men enjoy this scripture because it's saying that the woman should submit herself and we read the scriptures but we stop there but as they say keep reading [Applause] and he is the savior of the but then he speaks to the husbands husbands love your wives christ also love the church gave himself for it that he might sanctify him and cleanse it with the washing of the word washing of the water by the words notice what verse 27 says repeat four para four oracle [Applause] to a great purpose we're going to speak the woman in the animal kingdom in nature she's a strong male are you understanding not because she wants him so much wants to produce something good the product that she'll produce something that's worth it is that what they're going to produce she knows she'll produce weakly so they are worried for what they'll produce it matters a lot to them what will come out of them what they're going to produce this was the way the serpent came into east porquelle because he promised her produce that she would produce something great she didn't know but she believes this oh he might sanctify her limp cleanser with the washing of the water gloriosa that he presented to himself [Applause] the life of god [Applause] [Music] through the hands of god [Music] surrenders gladly she sees that he might present it to himself a glorious church we know that genesis 24. if you have your bible and if you don't it's fine i don't think i'll read it genesis 24 speaks to us of a type of the bride eliezer the servant of abraham for a bride for his lord his master when he goes and searches for a woman he searched for string characteristics where she needs to be convinced but for what reason no matter just because just because he has the title myself to you is the question women have is to the husband it's what it says it was with abraham and sarah says in the end times and he says there was a union between abram and sarah [Music] [Music] follows her husband gladly amira when she sees cuando ella when she sees that he guides her to the correct place but there's many of us want them to follow us just because we have the title sorry but you're so elongated just because i'm well i'm the man yes okay and and you know what this is one of the reasons why women have pain to follow their man because they're more wiser than he is if is is asking herself if i'm going to be just as you query do i want to be like you hallelujah yeah sometimes [Music] let me read this um this is the last one the master is a super sign this is but now he said you've got to make your choice where you go and look quickly as soon as she heard about isaac before she had ever saw him dijo yo she said i will go notice now rebecca rebecca accepted to follow him without even seeing him it's not about how it looks know how he looks or it's not about how he looks sometimes we think the woman follows a man for how handsome he is she does not follow him for how handsome he is women are very wise they hate to amen she did not follow isaac she did not follow this man just because he was handsome actually man now i don't believe rebecca followed him because she said oh he's great and big muscles why did she follow him what convinced her so follow me she had the decision to make purpose was because she believed that would come out of her iva grande would be something great when well god promised abraham and isaac dude you're descending [Applause] [Music] she was a blood relative to him that was abraham's brother's child isaac and rebecca were first cousins blood relation for the very god that predestinated the christ who was the lamb before the foundation the church itself its name was put on away from her mother or brother i want you to see this brethren it wasn't how wonderful isaac spoke to you i believe all of my hearts that will oh hallelujah it's speaking of a woman that went parachuting and when she was falling the parachute did not open ejected and choked the instructions and in that moment she realized she would die says that she fell on the ground and was surprised she was still alive and she's telling me of what happened to her uh i'm summarizing she says she noticed her legs were not responding she broke her spine she said she felt a pain so great on she's trying to understand where the pain is coming from until she realized that the pain was not something physical the pain was coming and began when she noticed and now her life wasn't worth anything and i read the scripture [Music] i believe uh beautiful is an understatement of how very beautiful she actually was in chapter 30 verse one says and when rachel saw that she bear jacob no children rachel envied her sister now notice raquel rachel pay attention please raquel rachel the one that everything fit her well elia and leah was the one that no one wanted to see she was an oddball no one set eyes on her but here's rachel embiliando alea envin her sister leah raquel rachel embiando or rachel says to jacob and said unto jacob give me children or else i die to see the pain inside this woman because she wants to where she didn't they're not going anywhere [Music] glory of jesus church his bride hella glorious prisoner of the lord jesus christ gloria no you say does god need glory no the glory in the world [Applause] a woman no establish isn't searching no necessity her main need is not versa we see it here with rachel she's probably the most beautiful in that region she was dying of pain the main need of a woman is [Music] who will because the moon does not have its own light and i'm getting into other things that's why i tell you this is very complex and the message of the philadelphian church age this is for the husbands and wives for both speaking on the woman a woman has no desire to follow him you have to follow me because it's god's word see yes but she will not do it gladly when that man submits himself to his kids that god has given him he gives purpose to his wife and that's what she was born for brethren so give birth to something great gloria to reflect glory see what brother branham says he reads isaiah 22 22. and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulders the spur uses this old testament reference concerning the lord jesus christ and his ministry in the church significa what the key of david's signatures at that time is mere shadow while sombra is complete in jesus which is now fulfilled in jesus christ but what hands it's not worn around his neck it is not placed in the hands of other men or the verse could not be saved no man has the right but jesus himself but where is just read then the government shall be under over his shoulder and the government upon his shoulder he is is she paid the price for her she be lost fully committed to him he accepts foreign [Applause] the light of my woman is to obey i believe there are that do so [Applause] better not to make you worse come on brother preach [Music] i gave myself my own words i will be better [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] his glory if there's a need in women you know why they don't obey okay because they say if i obey you where are you taking me if you want me to be as you are terminarciendo because a man is not leading her to anything great follow someone that won't take her anywhere something great for for his wife to follow him is where she will shine because she was made to shine la gracia the church was made for the glory of god when you know sometimes our family members san escondido del sol have hid away from the sun they're in darkness they've rejected the word of god from god the moon comes in times of darkness there is still a god god telling the world [Music] wants to reflect glory foreign she was made to give glory and god's house eve to simente your seed [Music] [Music] she wants to produce something greater than her [Music] she wants to say lord use me for something great [Music] she was made to give glory glory to reflect glory to reflect the glory of god to be something greater on this earth so god made me para produce circles [Music] may the lord [Music] now what will you do with him [Music] the woman gives to the man the man gives to the woman [Music] the woman gives to the man and the man says now let me take what you've given me and let's do grandes great things for god time to stand for god [Music] [Music] [Music] where am i leading you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you're coming for the pride of

[Music] is [Music] my foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] lovingly [Music] it's a message that a true man [Music] that makes you recognize where have we failed [Music] for [Music] [Music] and do the correct things [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] whoa [Music] [Applause] hallelujah i [Music] [Music] oh [Music] ah [Music] me [Music] today is my [Music] [Music] i have to die there um

advantage of it okay but there was one thing that i didn't touch uh they said brother branham says that those keys are on the shoulder he said that principal will be by over his shoulder [Music] we begin to think what do you have in your shoulders what's on the shoulder where she takes her veil off and puts it over the man's shoulder [Music] why the shoulder is the key in the shoulder brother [Music] [Music] [Music] into so much detail about that i was listening to a poet and and i like what he said look at the shoulders of the lord jesus christ because that's where we're going to put our trust this is our shoulders and who to cry on hombros shoulders we can lay our heads the shoulders that take all the the weight [Music] that takes the weight away from us [Music] shoulders have [Music] so he can take care of her [Music] of her husband [Music] but these suits make us look like we have big shoulders that's why a woman says man a man looks so good because you even get shoulders [Music] [Music] they make them so the shoulders look a little bit more firm and more bigger you look at a man later [Music] if the woman cannot come and lay herself on them [Music] [Music] notice the key is over his shoulders [Music] we're going to be here all this week [Music] i'm going to be here the following sunday as well and the next sunday and afternoon [Music] [Music] i want to speak
