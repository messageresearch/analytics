[21:19] our
[21:21] no working power is
[21:43] amen God bless you it's always good to
[21:46] be in the house of the Lord
[21:48] amen if we can open up our Bibles to the
[21:52] Book of Judges
[21:55] with a chapter three
[21:58] verse 31
[22:00] .
[22:03] amen
[22:05] go ahead and read it
[22:09] and it says like this
[22:11] and after him was shamgar the son of
[22:14] anith which slew of the Philistines 600
[22:17] men with an ox goat and he also
[22:20] delivered Israel
[22:31] I mean if we can flip over to the book
[22:34] of Ephesians as well
[22:36] foreign
[22:45] amen and it says like this
[22:47] it says for we are God's handiwork
[22:51] created in Christ Jesus to do good works
[22:53] which God prepared in advance for us to
[22:56] do
[23:00] Jesus
[23:06] amen if we can bow our heads
[23:11] Lord Jesus Christ
[23:13] we're just thankful Lord
[23:15] for all that you've given us father
[23:19] and for another opportunity you've given
[23:21] us to be here in your house
[23:24] we just asked that you speak to us today
[23:26] Lord
[23:28] that you take do you help us to step
[23:30] aside and just allow you to take control
[23:32] of the service
[23:37] they help us Lord and may this service
[23:40] be a blessing to us all yeah
[23:44] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:48] amen amen amen you may be seated
[23:54] amen we're going to be moving on to a
[23:57] new character
[24:01] and it's actually we'll be moving on to
[24:04] a new book in the Bible as well
[24:07] to the Book of Judges
[24:10] and the character we're going to be
[24:12] taking a look at today
[24:15] his name is
[24:18] amen and what shamgar is known for he uh
[24:24] as you read as we read here in the
[24:26] scripture
[24:28] is that shamgar killed 600 Philistines
[24:49] it's a really long stick about eight
[24:52] feet is
[24:54] foreign
[25:54] and to help to help settle disputes
[25:58] among them
[26:00] um
[26:01] so there were big leaders in their
[26:03] Community
[26:06] amen now what I find interesting though
[26:10] is that shamgar is only mentioned twice
[26:13] in the Bible
[26:14] says
[26:16] and really what you know about him is
[26:19] that he was the son of anes
[26:23] and you can assume that he was a farmer
[26:28] it doesn't exactly say that
[26:31] but that's about all it says about it
[26:37] in the way that that the Bible explains
[26:42] or the way that he shares his story
[26:47] is far it follows the stories of of
[26:51] great warriors
[26:57] of men who were trained in battle um
[27:02] who were real soldiers
[27:05] and one of them's name was othnio
[27:10] was the nephew of the great warrior
[27:12] Caleb is
[27:16] and he was one of the ones that that
[27:18] helped to deliver Israel from the from
[27:20] the from the pagan people that they
[27:22] lived with yes
[27:25] and then following him was
[27:31] also one of the ones that helped to
[27:33] deliver Israel
[27:37] now both of these men did this with
[27:39] tactic and they did it with an army
[27:44] and at the end of this third chapter of
[27:47] the Book of Judges
[27:52] you see that God couldn't to end that
[27:54] chapter without mentioning sham Garden
[27:56] man it is
[28:00] and I think that's because
[28:03] unlike those who preceded him
[28:09] in the scriptures is that he didn't have
[28:12] an army
[28:14] was a one-man Army amen
[28:19] wasn't a warrior
[28:23] didn't use A Warrior's weapon he didn't
[28:27] use a sword
[28:30] did was he used what he had amen
[28:36] amen amen and I believe that that when
[28:39] God Came Upon sham Garden
[28:42] is that God found him God I imagine that
[28:45] God found him working
[28:49] perhaps shamgar he was plowing his
[28:51] fields
[28:55] and the world around him the world
[28:57] around him the the rest of the
[28:59] Israelites knowing that they were being
[29:00] overtaken by the Philistines
[29:07] everybody was probably freaking out at
[29:09] that time
[29:13] and I I can just imagine shamgar just
[29:16] plowing away
[29:26] there's something inside of him just
[29:28] couldn't let him give up
[29:31] maybe he thought if they're gonna take
[29:34] everything from me
[29:37] I'm gonna at least give it a try amen
[29:41] amen even if I fail yeah
[29:45] I'm gonna give it a try man
[29:49] even though we may feel like we're gonna
[29:51] fail in this Christian world
[29:57] we still have to try
[30:00] until they try and be disappointed
[30:06] or don't try at all
[30:10] and never know if you're truly cut out
[30:13] for this
[30:16] you have nothing to do
[30:28] amen as a Christian you also have
[30:31] responsibilities
[30:35] had a responsibility to his family
[30:40] he couldn't stop working just because
[30:42] everybody else was was running away
[30:46] just because this country was being
[30:48] taken over well
[30:53] amen and I believe that that that's what
[30:55] allowed shamgar to have this great
[30:57] victory over the Philistines
[31:01] it's because the way what here let me
[31:05] read this for you
[31:07] it says like this listen to this because
[31:10] this is
[31:13] you determine your future
[31:16] by the man
[31:27] so whatever you have right now
[31:30] the responsibility is that you have
[31:34] take them seriously because if you don't
[31:38] take them seriously
[31:39] then God can't give you more
[31:42] and you might say well I don't have
[31:45] mucho I'm not responsible for a lot
[31:48] right now
[31:51] and that's okay because the Bible says
[31:54] if you're faithful in the little and yes
[32:01] all he had was an Old Farmer's tool
[32:06] he had no military training
[32:11] he had no Army amen all he had to show
[32:15] for himself
[32:17] was the work that he put in day in and
[32:19] day out
[32:21] and that's exactly what God used amen
[32:25] God will use whatever you give him
[32:29] if you give him of your time
[32:31] he will use it
[32:34] if you give him your energy he will use
[32:36] it
[32:38] if you sacrifice time away from things
[32:45] sports and entertainment
[32:51] when you begin to talk about work
[32:56] sacrifices and responsibilities
[33:00] it doesn't sit well with today's youth
[33:02] amen
[33:05] amen I found a quote and I thought it
[33:07] was pretty good it says
[33:11] it says many people
[33:13] want to ride the train
[33:16] but no one wants to lay down the tracks
[33:21] I thought it was pretty good amen
[33:24] many times I want I want it I want it in
[33:27] my hand
[33:29] I want them to feed it to me
[33:32] and then I'm glad that my dad and my mom
[33:38] they're teaching me and my brothers to
[33:39] be responsible amenities
[33:42] I mean this guy here yesterday
[33:45] he's constantly in my ears
[33:48] telling me that nothing in life is free
[33:53] and then I found that out this month
[33:55] because I paid the internet bill um
[33:59] amen amen blessed be the name of the
[34:02] Lord
[34:04] amen and when you start talking about
[34:06] growing up to the youth is
[34:12] the excuses amen
[34:15] which he doesn't like to hear either
[34:19] amen you get excuses like I don't have
[34:22] the abilities
[34:26] remember abilities aren't something
[34:28] that's built into you
[34:31] it's not something that's pre-programmed
[34:36] to stay the same
[34:38] your abilities can grow
[34:42] an increase
[34:45] when you learn but the only way to learn
[34:49] is to struggle
[34:51] is
[34:53] to make mistakes
[34:55] it's to fall
[34:58] but many of us don't want to amen
[35:06] another excuse that you get
[35:09] I don't have the resources
[35:12] you have all the resources
[35:15] you have your parents you have your
[35:18] pastors you have the entire church
[35:21] and God has all the windows of Heaven at
[35:24] your disposal
[35:27] that's not exactly an excuse you can use
[35:32] another one that I'm I'm personally
[35:34] acquainted with
[35:37] um
[35:40] I don't have the time
[35:42] when in reality all we have is time
[35:47] we have more than enough amen if we
[35:50] would just quit sleeping in so late
[35:53] then maybe we would have more time
[35:56] do what you have to do
[35:59] wake up earlier stay late
[36:06] just make sure you get done what you
[36:08] have to get done you better look at
[36:10] things and one thing to know that I've
[36:13] learned about the kingdom of God
[36:17] and how to have success
[36:22] um I learned this while I was kind of
[36:23] studying about shamgar aprendiest
[36:26] don't blame don't blame your lack of
[36:29] success
[36:33] on your instruments or your surroundings
[36:36] instrumentals
[36:44] and that's all he had but God used it
[36:49] and if you use what you have is
[36:53] God will give you more
[36:55] I don't think that shamgar ever thought
[36:58] that he was going to use that tour to
[36:59] kill 600 people
[37:04] but many times
[37:06] is our expectations
[37:10] whatever God has given you
[37:14] no matter how simple it might be
[37:17] if you have chance then just at least
[37:21] if you have a mouth then say Amen
[37:25] raise your hands pray for somebody
[37:28] and God will give you more
[37:31] and amen and people make the excuse
[37:35] that that God God wants to help you amen
[37:40] that God wants you to be still okay
[37:44] amen but God wants you to do all that
[37:46] you can before he helps amen
[37:51] he wants you to to push yourself to your
[37:54] limits
[38:00] not only for for him to see
[38:04] but for you to see
[38:19] amen the Bible's filled with these
[38:21] different examples of Simplicity
[38:26] of how God works in Simplicity
[38:30] and shamgar just had a farmer's tools
[38:35] Moses had the rod that he took
[38:37] everywhere with him
[38:45] and that Rod also parted the sea amen
[38:49] all David has all David had was a stone
[38:54] and that that little Stone yes
[38:58] was essentially what brought him to the
[39:00] throne
[39:02] I didn't mean for that rhyme it just
[39:04] came out
[39:06] foreign
[40:06] foreign
[40:07] [Music]
[40:10] [Applause]
[41:16] if we can turn to Judges chapter 3 verse
[41:19] 31 again
[41:30] and after him was Shem called the son of
[41:33] anes which slew of the Philistine 600
[41:35] men with an ox goat and he also
[41:38] delivered Israel
[41:41] we're going to continue talking about
[41:42] shamgarh
[41:44] and the title that we put
[41:48] it's in Spanish it's in espanol it's
[41:51] called Tu puedes you are able and
[41:54] English is you are able in English
[41:57] and when when brother Tito told me that
[42:00] we're gonna talk about a new Bible
[42:02] character
[42:07] and I asked him who it was
[42:11] and he told me it was
[42:14] and he told me brother Brandon talked
[42:17] about him quite a bit
[42:21] um
[42:23] he mentions them 51 times
[42:27] in the Bible he has not mentioned many
[42:29] times
[42:32] you know but I I believe if if he was
[42:36] just mentioned uh very few times in the
[42:39] Bible
[42:41] he was a hero to God
[42:45] and he and he was worth mentioning
[42:51] you know I I I didn't see much about him
[42:54] in the Bible
[42:57] but I believe he did a a great impact in
[43:00] that time
[43:02] you know how he was just a ordinary
[43:07] Persona ordinary you know he was just a
[43:11] farm laborer
[43:12] you know he he he wasn't mad he wasn't
[43:16] uh he he wasn't a great person a a big
[43:23] Persona he was just a regular small
[43:26] person
[43:28] it was just a regular ordinary person
[43:33] you know he he was he was working his
[43:36] field he was working he was saving all
[43:38] his crops
[43:41] so him and his family can have something
[43:44] to eat for the winner
[43:49] umbrella Brandon talks about
[43:54] he says maybe one one day he didn't hear
[43:57] he he thought the Philistines were not
[43:59] going to come
[44:02] down
[44:04] and he heard them marching down
[44:09] you know coming down towards him
[44:12] he couldn't see them
[44:15] but he can hear them coming
[44:19] and these men were were warriors
[44:24] they were trained to fight foreign
[44:40] just chop somebody up real quick
[44:44] you know but you know but and and as
[44:48] samgard looked at his wife and his kids
[44:54] you know and he said how am I going to
[44:57] let them starved
[45:00] you know I I I I gotta do something
[45:03] about it
[45:05] you know I can't just stay there and
[45:15] you know I don't know how to use a uh
[45:17] excuse me if I say this wrong but a
[45:19] sword
[45:21] you know there's no way I I know how to
[45:24] use it no no no
[45:26] even if I had a shield I wouldn't know
[45:28] how to use it
[45:31] I don't know what am I gonna do you know
[45:34] he says he started walking back and
[45:37] forth pacing back and forth
[45:40] he knew that he couldn't wait for them
[45:43] to show up and take all his his his his
[45:45] his crops
[45:53] you know I I gotta do something about it
[45:57] and that's when God came to him
[46:02] and he reminded him of who he was
[46:06] that he was the seed of
[46:15] and if he can over if Abraham was over
[46:18] able to overcome
[46:21] he can overcome as well
[46:24] he can overcome the enemy
[46:29] and I can imagine him just looking
[46:31] around desperately
[46:33] well this is
[46:38] the way I don't know if you guys can put
[46:41] a picture of it up
[46:48] you know it's it's eight feet long
[46:52] it's used to to move the cattle around
[46:57] and that's all he needed yes
[47:01] with no experience
[47:04] to go and kill those 600 Philistines
[47:07] sold
[47:35] you know
[47:41] many times he tries to take us down
[47:44] he tries to tell us that we're not
[47:46] worthy
[47:48] he tells us that we are nobody
[47:52] that you that you're not able to do
[47:54] nothing
[47:56] you know but we have that same seed
[47:59] that same Seed of Abraham
[48:02] you know if he was able to use
[48:07] he was able to use Abraham
[48:10] if he was able to use Moses
[48:13] if he was able to use Joseph I mean Jose
[48:17] how much more can he use us that we have
[48:19] that same seat
[48:22] you know sometimes we ask ourselves
[48:25] you know I'm nobody knows
[48:33] but brother Branham says
[48:36] you're just in the perfect shape for God
[48:39] to use you
[48:41] don't need to be somebody
[48:45] you could be something so small
[48:48] you could be a sinner
[48:50] but you're just in perfect shape for God
[48:53] to use you
[48:59] why do you use me the way you use me
[49:06] oh here at church
[49:08] they're way better questions than I am
[49:13] sorry you know but why do you use me God
[49:17] there's better Christians here
[49:20] and you know and God tells me this
[49:25] if I was able to use Moses know that he
[49:28] was a drunk
[49:31] if I was able to use Moses that he was a
[49:34] stutterer
[49:36] you know if I was able to use Joseph
[49:38] that was a nobody yeah
[49:41] you know I was able to use a prostitute
[49:46] how much more can I do with you
[49:50] Brothers how much more God can do with
[49:53] us
[49:54] we should never question what God can do
[49:57] with them
[51:05] the fish
[51:48] you know but he he was used
[51:52] he was used to fear to free the
[51:55] Israelites too
[51:57] and how much more can he use us
[52:03] hey man
[52:17] don't let the world tell you who you are
[52:19] no le permitage
[52:22] if someone could just remember
[52:27] oh God told us we were before the
[52:29] foundation of the world
[52:36] don't let the world tell you who you
[52:37] should be
[52:41] God can still use you
[52:44] it doesn't matter how young you are
[52:46] important
[52:47] how old you are
[52:51] God can use you in so many ways
[53:03] 28 26 and I'm just going to read the
[53:05] last
[53:08] I Am With You Always and even into the
[53:12] end of the world
[53:17] he is with us every day
[53:21] it doesn't matter how many times we fail
[53:23] no important it doesn't matter how
[53:28] how many times we stumbled or cuantos
[53:30] versus
[53:34] God is still there
[53:36] you just have to let yourself to be
[53:39] allowed to be used
[53:42] and do the work that God wants to do
[53:45] with you
[53:51] Isaiah 41 10 says
[53:56] I will uphold it with the right hand of
[53:59] righteousness
[54:04] you know he will always hold us
[54:08] he will always keep us with him
[54:12] if he chose us since the foundation of
[54:15] the world
[54:17] how much can how much more
[54:25] again how much more can you do with us
[54:37] if he keeps bringing back your past
[54:41] you know I think we need to start
[54:43] reminding what his future looks like
[54:47] we need to tell him that he is
[54:51] that he's a bluffer okay
[54:54] I am not the bluffer you know but he is
[54:59] the liar
[55:03] thank you Brothers God bless you
[55:06] [Applause]
[55:20] is
[55:26] I was remembering sitting down
[55:32] what if we set the scene in a bedding
[55:36] house
[55:37] 600 Philistines
[55:39] against one Israelite
[55:43] who would you bet on
[55:47] it's the one that's more logical
[55:51] but God
[55:58] is
[55:59] God is a little strange
[56:07] significant God enjoys making from
[56:10] something insignificant
[56:14] to lift up his name so high
[56:18] and in this night
[56:21] foreign
[56:23] families
[56:29] it says
[56:35] he was a normal person
[56:47] and then
[56:52] shamgar was the third judge
[56:56] but this man before being a judge
[57:00] nobody he was we can say a nobody
[57:03] he wasn't anyone
[57:07] he didn't have an uncle like
[57:10] foreign
[57:29] [Applause]

[1:00:12] remembered
[1:00:16] is mentioned in a little piece of the
[1:00:19] Bible
[1:00:21] I want that in the book of Acts
[1:00:26] days
[1:00:28] have something written about me
[1:00:32] if you want a little part of that as
[1:00:35] well
[1:00:38] my mind
[1:00:48] the Philistine come and take what he had
[1:00:51] they said he says oh my mother

[1:02:37] dioses it doesn't matter how many odds
[1:02:40] are against you God is with you not
[1:02:42] going to

[1:03:03] amen
[1:03:09] Thomas
[1:03:11] take his word
[1:03:16] he says there's one thing I know
[1:03:19] I am circumcised
[1:03:26] I'm a Philistine I mean I'm in Israelite
[1:03:29] brother Branham says
[1:03:32] he says you're a sinner and this night
[1:03:34] you're a son of God
[1:03:36] you're a Son of God
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:54] who made you who created
[1:04:07] to tell you who you are
[1:04:15] right Glory
[1:04:22] okay
[1:04:24] that is uncircumcised philistine
[1:04:29] I know that I'm right
[1:04:34] how many know that you're in the right
[1:04:37] tonight
[1:04:39] you must know
[1:04:43] what you're believing in brothers
[1:04:46] or you're rooted
[1:04:55] brother Branham says
[1:05:00] we make excuses
[1:05:03] with our weaknesses
[1:05:08] you know what one of our weaknesses are
[1:05:12] and what my brother my sister do
[1:05:17] that's one of our weaknesses
[1:05:21] that does not allow us to advance
[1:05:24] we can advance foreign
[1:06:00] I think that's one of the things that
[1:06:02] God gave me for text was to get out of
[1:06:05] our mind
[1:06:09] and the text was perfect strength by
[1:06:11] perfect
[1:06:13] because sometimes we think we're too
[1:06:15] great
[1:06:16] try it
[1:06:22] sometimes I think there's too much Fidel
[1:06:24] in me
[1:06:25] too much brother
[1:06:28] you know
[1:06:29] I'm not sure if there's too much of you
[1:06:32] for me I say that for myself
[1:06:39] to blame or guilty
[1:06:42] I'm the one that's guilty
[1:06:45] because I hinder God
[1:06:48] because I'm hindering God
[1:06:57] I always blame someone else
[1:07:08] to blame
[1:07:10] right
[1:07:11] amen
[1:07:26] is
[1:07:29] there's little things that we do and
[1:07:31] that's what we come to church for
[1:07:35] us is to find out where our fault is
[1:07:42] and the things that we might better
[1:07:44] ourselves by
[1:07:58] I'm afraid we won't get too much out of
[1:08:01] coming at church
[1:08:04] that's why we live very defeated
[1:08:06] sometimes
[1:08:09] because we come
[1:08:13] with the wrong attitude
[1:08:16] foreign
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:09:17] took everything away
[1:09:21] they heard them malnourished
[1:09:26] that they took away everything amen
[1:09:35] is
[1:09:39] what does being poor in spirit mean
[1:09:43] s
[1:09:44] that our heart be in the right place
[1:09:47] and spirit
[1:09:52] where we've surrendered everything
[1:09:57] to God
[1:10:03] and we don't feel we have anything of
[1:10:06] ourselves
[1:10:10] we don't have anything to lose
[1:10:19] we don't have anything to lose brethren
[1:10:24] for everything to gain
[1:10:30] amen
[1:10:31] yes
[1:10:33] I was saying what's more important than
[1:10:36] eternal life
[1:10:37] important than
[1:10:41] eternal life
[1:10:50] how can our trials be easier for us
[1:10:56] he says trials are harder for us
[1:11:01] because we haven't decided to surrender
[1:11:04] everything to God shamgar
[1:11:22] he was in a crossroad in other words
[1:11:30] get in Tania he had
[1:11:33] they say
[1:11:35] foreign
[1:11:55] there was no other way
[1:11:59] there's no other way is
[1:12:03] the only way God has provided
[1:12:06] for there to be success in our lives
[1:12:10] you have to place everything
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:16] that's where there's a squeeze
[1:12:20] because we don't want no one to give us
[1:12:22] orders
[1:12:24] oh I'm the owner of my life
[1:12:27] how's the pastor going to tell me
[1:12:29] otherwise
[1:12:33] that the pastor is helping you sir

[1:12:43] Eternity in other words
[1:12:45] he's helping you Perfection he is
[1:12:49] perfecting us

[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:50] before
[1:34:56] they took everything away from him over
[1:35:00] here
[1:35:01] every single year he was defeated
[1:35:05] every year
[1:35:07] he was left with nothing
[1:35:10] [Music]
[1:35:14] if there's something that I can sit by
[1:35:16] shame
[1:35:17] that he didn't give up
[1:35:22] at the point where brother Bennett said
[1:35:28] that our righteous righteous anger came
[1:35:31] to him
[1:35:32] foreign
[1:35:38] you know what
[1:35:41] jono Correo I don't believe because
[1:35:44] I believe that he was going to build
[1:35:46] that he was going to win
[1:35:48] I don't believe okay
[1:35:53] so 600 Philistines
[1:35:56] thinking that he was going to win
[1:35:58] I believe
[1:36:00] he was so mad
[1:36:03] so tired
[1:36:06] whatever I can kill
[1:36:10] with me
[1:36:13] if he was so sick and tired but he said
[1:36:16] Lord
[1:36:17] [Applause]
[1:36:18] go home

[1:36:27] what I could have fought

[1:36:37] if I die today
[1:36:39] I died today
[1:36:43] fighting for what I believe
[1:36:47] did not give up
[1:36:50] he said this year
[1:36:53] I will go
[1:36:55] [Music]
[1:36:57] I will go out fighting
[1:37:01] I believe that's what I think
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:04] every year he was defeated
[1:37:08] but he said
[1:37:11] I would not be a coward this year
[1:37:14] I will believe in God this year
[1:37:17] I will believe what he can do for me if
[1:37:21] I die I died
