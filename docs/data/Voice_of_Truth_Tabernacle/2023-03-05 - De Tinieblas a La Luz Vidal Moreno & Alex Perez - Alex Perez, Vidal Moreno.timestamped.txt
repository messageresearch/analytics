[24:05] foreign
[24:07] [Music]
[24:43] six
[24:59] better yet let's start from verse 5.
[25:09] chapter 1 verse 5.
[25:16] now we're talking about the first coming
[25:19] of the Lord
[25:24] and it says in a in the coming manner
[25:28] you said
[25:32] no
[25:36] contraya and the light shineth in
[25:39] darkness and the Darkness comprehended
[25:41] it's not
[25:45] there was a man sent from God whose name
[25:48] was John
[25:49] Estes
[25:56] the same came for a witness to Bear
[25:58] witness of the light that all men
[26:00] through him might believe
[26:06] he was not the light but was sent to
[26:09] Bear witness of the light
[26:13] let's go to the book of Isaiah
[26:17] chapter 40 verse
[26:22] three to five
[26:26] Isaiah 40 verse 3
[26:29] this is
[26:31] in the following manner
[26:39] and it is
[26:44] the force of him that Christ in the
[26:46] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[26:48] Lord make straight in the desert a
[26:50] highway for our God
[26:52] a
[27:01] hello
[27:04] every Valley shall be exalted and every
[27:07] mountain and hail shall be made low and
[27:09] the crooks shall be made straight and
[27:12] the rough Place plain
[27:15] let us power our heads to pray
[27:19] blessed and glorious Heavenly Father
[27:22] give you thanks in this morning
[27:26] for the privilege that you give us
[27:30] so being able to listen to this precious
[27:33] word
[27:35] you anoint the lips are going to speak
[27:39] and you see the need of your people
[27:44] and see what they are needing off
[27:51] through your word father
[27:54] uh
[27:57] that you Lord be glorified in this
[27:59] morning
[28:01] we give you thanks for all
[28:06] so that you may be ingratened
[28:10] yeah
[28:11] we ask all of this in the name of the
[28:13] Lord Jesus Christ
[28:15] I mean amen you you may be seated
[28:19] Brethren uh as a title Alex
[28:25] brother Alex alongside me uh
[28:32] we put from Darkness to lights
[28:39] now we're going to talk about what is a
[28:42] forerunner
[29:07] his message amen
[29:19] he was the Forerunner of our Lord Jesus
[29:22] Christ amen amen
[29:26] but we see that when he sent someone
[29:29] else
[29:31] he always prepares that man
[29:36] he always separates him
[29:40] he never has them with the punches
[29:44] because he has to make a separation
[29:54] I believe we have been separated
[29:58] each and every one of us
[30:01] every individual here
[30:53] in circular Greek the term was
[30:56] frequently as as a military term for
[30:59] advanced scouts or Calvary that prepared
[31:01] for a Full Assault I mean
[31:25] amen amen Brothers
[31:41] forerunners is used to metaphorically
[31:43] for the first ripe fruits
[31:57] this usually suggests that the Christian
[32:00] hope of entering God's presence is
[32:02] guaranteed by the Forerunner already
[32:04] reaching this goal
[32:07] I don't know if you're capturing this
[32:12] a foreign
[32:43] Jesus Christ
[32:46] let us continue reading
[32:49] ideas
[32:54] a similar ideas expressed in the image
[32:57] of Christ as a pioneer of salvation
[33:06] the first of many children that God
[33:08] brings to Glory through suffering
[33:10] significant significant
[33:16] significantly Christ is Forerunner for
[33:19] us
[33:22] having run ahead on the road of
[33:25] suffering
[33:29] Christ became the source of Salvation
[33:33] that makes our following possible
[33:41] in English foreign
[34:44] and the people had to be in a certain
[34:46] conditions
[35:14] that's where God prepared him
[35:20] a place in which I can say truly was
[35:24] lonely
[35:25] I could imagine
[35:28] John asked himself
[35:31] why am I here
[35:34] I could imagine
[35:38] many of you asked yourself the same
[35:40] question
[35:43] because God prepares his people
[35:52] a complete Saint person
[35:59] there has to be
[36:02] a complete separation
[36:07] [Music]
[36:08] because he's a jealous God Brothers
[36:19] the scripture shows me here
[36:22] um
[36:28] what the message that John had
[36:35] in Isaiah 40
[36:38] . this is
[36:48] every Valley shall be exalted Every
[36:51] Mountain and Hills shall be made low and
[36:53] the Crooked shall be made straight and
[36:54] The Rock Place is plain
[36:57] no message in which John had
[37:05] [Music]
[37:08] and the Pharisees were bringing in those
[37:10] days
[37:59] that's what I believe amen amen
[38:05] in this life
[38:07] is
[38:11] no I believe that people believe there's
[38:13] disadvantages
[38:18] they say well I'm poor
[38:22] oh the rich man has more advantages
[38:26] because he has more than me
[38:30] bought this message
[38:32] is
[38:34] made to make things even
[38:39] your poverty Aquino important it does
[38:43] not matter to God
[38:54] we have a good home I know in Portland
[38:58] if you have education
[39:05] let's do even things out amen amen
[39:17] God comes here and brings them down
[39:22] [Applause]
[39:35] I'm sorry
[39:38] oh girl that's what I believe whoever
[39:56] you can obtain it here
[39:59] amen amen amen amen
[40:04] you're looking over Manos I believe her
[40:07] brothers
[40:09] the prophet says
[40:18] the great king and Prince sorry and King
[40:22] this is
[40:25] hope we have
[40:28] Christ The Foreigner has already come
[40:31] this is
[40:31] [Music]
[40:33] you know what a forerunner is
[40:38] something that runs before or goes ahead
[40:43] in the foreign
[41:07] after he had completed his sacrifice on
[41:10] Calvary Calvary you see it he said
[41:12] nothing this is nothing now he says
[41:16] he was born in humility
[41:19] in a Manger
[41:27] he was made fun of us
[41:32] anyone else who serves him this is
[41:40] a person
[41:44] respect the person he loves it is
[42:11] [Applause]
[42:29] John was a foreign
[43:02] he goes ahead
[43:17] [Applause]
[43:23] [Music]
[43:54] come on Amen
[43:57] the question is
[44:00] will you suffer with him
[44:08] that's something one should one should
[44:11] think
[44:13] in the message
[44:16] you throw one that John brought
[44:22] came to declare
[44:24] Jesus
[44:28] we see
[44:30] Juan where John went
[44:36] we see when God sends them to his
[44:38] ministry
[44:41] he sends them to the people of that day
[44:47] he didn't go through the big cities
[44:57] [Music]
[45:18] you know the Jordan River significance
[45:31] I don't believe
[46:19] amen Brothers
[46:22] I'm going to be finishing now
[46:26] you know
[46:30] the message that John brought
[46:33] it's not very popular
[46:37] especially with the religious people
[46:39] of that day
[46:43] in itself this message
[46:47] John said in the scripture
[46:51] the ax is put on the roots
[46:57] this message
[46:59] came to decapitate amen amen
[47:04] you know what this message came to do is
[47:07] you know that all of us
[47:16] tear down our heads
[47:19] how many times
[47:23] I have the message they say Hermanos
[47:25] Brothers
[47:28] all right you have the message
[47:31] now the question is
[47:46] [Applause]
[47:51] Jesus Christ the word amen
[47:55] that's what I believe
[47:59] this message came to cut off heads
[48:11] people that thought they knew
[48:20] I know
[48:22] we don't know Jesus a man came to Jesus
[48:26] called Nicodemus
[48:30] Jesus and I believe when he saw all the
[48:32] Wonders that God did
[48:34] maybe he thoughts
[48:44] I want one yes
[49:00] I believe that we have that type of
[49:02] mentality
[49:04] draws near to Jesus
[49:06] and Jesus says to him
[49:09] it is necessary to be born again
[49:12] in few words
[49:16] it's worth nothing
[49:30] it doesn't look good Brothers
[49:50] the question is do you have him amen
[49:53] amen
[49:56] one John
[50:00] here in darkness
[50:03] but he had said separated
[50:06] many yes yes
[50:09] many kids are scared of the dark is
[50:22] it because you have no head
[51:23] possible foreign
[51:56] entered into prison
[52:00] before going in
[52:04] what he was doing
[52:10] had a plan is
[52:17] when they put them into darkness
[52:24] prison
[52:53] God bless you
[52:55] [Applause]
[52:58] Hallelujah
[53:02] God bless you in this precious morning
[53:05] look
[53:08] Luke chapter 10 verse 21
[53:12] .
[53:15] we're happy to be in this place in this
[53:18] morning
[53:19] talking about the coming of the Lord
[53:29] said and we're going to talk about
[53:31] Darkness to light apocalypse
[53:36] Luke chapter 10 verse 21 where once you
[53:39] have it you can say with the name man
[53:40] this is
[53:43] the word of God says in the coming
[53:45] manner
[53:47] Espiritu
[53:56] foreign
[54:17] Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou has
[54:20] hid these things from the wise and
[54:22] prudence and has revealed them unto
[54:23] babies even so father for so it seemed
[54:26] good in thy sight Okay
[54:30] add blessings unto his word
[54:33] throughout time
[54:39] God has never revealed himself to a
[54:42] great punch
[54:46] religios religious groups
[55:05] God has always revealed himself to
[55:07] individuals
[55:10] you may ask yourself this in this
[55:12] morning
[55:15] why doesn't God reveal to himself to
[55:17] Great multitude
[55:20] religious systems Grande wouldn't that
[55:24] be something greater
[55:26] wouldn't God be able to take the message
[55:36] disperse his message
[55:41] apparently it would seem that there will
[55:43] be more benefits
[56:41] could you imagine yourself
[56:44] walking through to the temple presenting
[56:46] himself to the priest
[56:49] and saying to them behold I have come to
[56:52] the city
[56:55] can you imagine the high priests
[57:02] and say okay

[57:32] will come
[57:45] and presenting himself as Christ the
[57:47] Messiah
[57:53] can you imagine yourself with different
[57:55] ideas that would come out of that place
[58:00] it would be something terrible foreign
[58:42] is that we like to reason things

[1:00:57] why
[1:01:12] [Applause]
[1:01:26] to start off
[1:02:20] Supreme amen
[1:02:24] because God cannot risk
[1:02:30] one of the reasons why God
[1:02:33] is
[1:02:34] very careful
[1:02:37] because God has secrets
[1:02:43] that's fine
[1:02:45] secrets
[1:02:49] imagine yourself
[1:02:55] to you his secrets
[1:03:04] mysterious and you're not having the
[1:03:06] capacity of being able to to to
