pray senior Jesus Christ you would help us the word will enter into the hearts of your children what we need is restoring the families I believe Brothers where we're all broken the families are broken Everything Is Broken [Music] there's a lot of Chaos of our Lord Jesus Christ if we noticed plus Planters fluorescence the the flowers lay they Bloomberg and and the winters is drawing now the flowers begin to uh they begin to die amen Hermanos amen Brothers but don't forget one thing that we're the seeds and that's a promise for God's children Hermanos look Brothers Nosotros we they die when when the winter ceases to be cuando is then it comes forward to give life again Jesus Christ foreign this is true the war is not some fiction status calm down because I know yeah foreign to destroy leave I've done it Brothers unfortunately I have done it am I proud of it no I'm not proud of it at all yes I'm not proud of how I speak to my wife many times absolutely not okay because it's an animal-like Behavior I need to be restored his words I have some apples over here it is foreign amen Brothers that's why there's many problems but we have to understand why the devil came to what they came to destroy he didn't come to restore God came to restore but the devil came to destroy amen Brothers to understand God on Earth amen amen the second thing Brothers is that we need to listen to the word of God not only here is but understand it and understand is to understand it's very important because if we don't understand we won't be able to uh do it now thank God that we're in this church where we can come freely to the message of the hour well we can ask for an appointment and be able to ask foreign la to be foreign nobody can hear you hear it nobody can understand you it's nothing but dead

uh appear or pretend that we're something we're not my main point is that there is the message has been given to us in these last days you need to pretend something this is an answer yes that we're not to be something we're not a persona is you pretend you have something that you don't have so you pretend to possess only but in reality you do not have it foreign you can't lie to your family I saw it was posted your wife Brothers when your wife doesn't get close to you to ask for your help something is wrong in you know to ask for yourself your children something is wrong with me things that are necessary to survive foreign for God what account will we give um could you imagine Brothers 20 30 years in the Christian home foreign foreign about the real things of life this in the bride they say yes and I proceed they say this is let's see okay is always taught your family according to work the word and tell them what is written what the Bible says and what the message what the message told us and um there's a great key there if you want a good marriage correct what you have messed up correct because if you don't make it right you'll continue walking continue to have a happy
