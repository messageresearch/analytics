[37:57] F my name isben
[38:01] f Valley we're in Moro
[38:07] Valley and we're there attending a
[38:09] tabernacle callede
[38:13] Tabernacle the immutable
[38:18] God there my wife one of my
[38:25] sons also a sister from our
[38:29] church and I truly
[38:32] felt very
[38:35] stimulated when God began to work in
[38:37] this
[38:39] place upon hearing the
[38:42] testimonies
[38:45] felt greatly stimulated how God
[38:50] moves so
[38:54] simply with the great power
[38:57] with great
[39:01] evidence always looking for a man to put
[39:03] his hands
[39:05] on remember on one
[39:10] occas it was a person that we
[39:14] knew and it was someone that I really
[39:16] didn't
[39:16] know but after I prayed for him that was
[39:20] at
[39:23] work and sweating but I looked at him
[39:27] [Music]
[39:29] and that man he
[39:30] said that he felt
[39:32] sick and he returned three days
[39:35] later and he laughed with me and he
[39:39] said I love
[39:42] you the pain left me he
[39:44] says th be the name of the
[39:47] Lord I returned 15 days
[39:51] later and he said I come from coming
[39:54] back with the
[39:55] doctor he said I no longer need
[39:59] chemotherapy I was struggling with eight
[40:01] years
[40:02] for cancer in his
[40:05] liver Oh Glory to
[40:09] God she offered me Med
[40:13] medicine and I told her that Jesus
[40:15] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[40:17] forever and he told his
[40:21] wife we don't need a
[40:24] doctor we don't need a pastor
[40:29] we need a
[40:32] mechanic someone to
[40:34] believe I believe that there can be a
[40:37] home that's
[40:39] broken a taxi
[40:41] driver or
[40:43] perhaps who cooks and
[40:47] some something that the prophet said
[40:49] that impacted me
[40:51] great on that day I present myself as a
[40:55] failure not as a
[40:58] coward I believe that there are many
[41:01] here have tried and they want to get to
[41:03] their
[41:06] attitud it was for the work of the Lord
[41:08] Jesus
[41:09] Christ he is above us all to him be the
[41:12] honor and the glory glory to
[41:25] God
[41:31] God bless
[41:43] [Music]
[41:55] you
[41:59] [Music]
[42:03] in a time when it was dry not a cloud up
[42:08] in the
[42:09] sky the children of God began to reason
[42:15] why so they went to God's man cuz they
[42:20] did not understand he said go look it's
[42:25] written in
[42:27] [Music]
[42:29] the now they open the door a seven time

[42:39] rising from the
[42:42] sea and they began to understand the

[43:03] hand I see a clown like a
[43:10] man I see a clown like a man's
[43:18] hands and I know it's going to

[43:37] door have faith and just believe a new

[1:14:25] but his
[1:14:27] word endureth
[1:14:30] forever and let me tell you
[1:14:32] something I've received a
[1:14:35] revelation that I am not this
[1:14:39] body I am that manifested word of
[1:14:44] God for this
[1:14:46] age so I cannot end one more I cannot
[1:14:52] end
[1:14:54] I cannot
[1:14:57] die my body might
[1:15:00] die My Flesh might get
[1:15:03] out but the burning that lives inside of
[1:15:10] here not even the burning that lives
[1:15:12] inside of
[1:15:14] here the Jesus that lives inside of
[1:15:18] here that part of
[1:15:21] God the lust from
[1:15:24] God that spun
[1:15:26] out and came into this
[1:15:30] body shall never
[1:15:33] die praise the Lamb of
[1:15:38] God let's open up our scriptures while
[1:15:40] we're standing before I get too
[1:15:49] excited it's good to be a
[1:15:52] Christian
[1:15:54] I didn't always think
[1:15:56] so I didn't always think
[1:16:06] so but I do
[1:16:09] now it's good to be a
[1:16:12] Christian let's look in the book of
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:17] Hebrews chapter
[1:16:19] three isn't this a beautiful Tabernacle
[1:16:24] let's give an Applause offering of
[1:16:26] praise to the Lord for providing this
[1:16:37] place it says like this wherefore holy
[1:16:41] Brethren partakers of the Heavenly
[1:16:44] calling consider the Apostle and high
[1:16:47] priest of our profession Jesus
[1:16:52] Christ
[1:17:01] who was faithful to him that appointed
[1:17:04] him as also Moses was faithful in all
[1:17:08] his
[1:17:15] house I just want to put a insert a side
[1:17:18] note
[1:17:21] here how tremendous the Holy Spirit Led
[1:17:25] Paul to
[1:17:28] write see the reference here that he
[1:17:31] gives to
[1:17:33] Moses actually shortens this chapter by
[1:17:36] about three
[1:17:40] chapters because it immediately draws a
[1:17:42] picture in the mind of the he of the
[1:17:44] Hebrew
[1:17:48] children of all that Moses
[1:17:52] did and all that Moses
[1:17:55] said so he doesn't have to go back
[1:17:57] through
[1:17:59] that and talk about how Moses
[1:18:04] said that there'll be a Prophet come
[1:18:06] like
[1:18:08] me he immediately places him
[1:18:12] there as the faithful
[1:18:16] one in the
[1:18:18] house of
[1:18:21] God
[1:18:23] for this man was counted worthy of more
[1:18:28] Glory than Moses in as much as he who
[1:18:33] hath builded the house hath more honor
[1:18:38] than the
[1:18:47] house but you you see what he's doing
[1:18:50] here places Moses
[1:18:54] their hero their
[1:18:57] lawgiver the great
[1:18:59] Messiah that took him out of
[1:19:02] Egypt that took him all the way to the
[1:19:05] promised
[1:19:06] land and turned it over to his
[1:19:10] servants Joshua and Caleb to take them
[1:19:14] into the
[1:19:16] land this great
[1:19:18] prophet that God did not speak to
[1:19:21] envisions did not speak to in
[1:19:24] dreams but he spoke to him face to
[1:19:28] face in his M the glory of God shown
[1:19:31] through
[1:19:34] him and said
[1:19:36] This Not only was faithful in the house
[1:19:39] of
[1:19:41] God he could be called the house of
[1:19:46] God but the builder of the house of
[1:19:50] God is greater than the house House of
[1:20:00] God in as much as he who hath builded
[1:20:03] the house hath more honor than the
[1:20:10] house for every house is
[1:20:15] builded by some
[1:20:18] man but he that built all things
[1:20:23] is
[1:20:29] god let's pray Lord
[1:20:32] Jesus we ask your mercy and Grace upon
[1:20:36] us
[1:20:40] today surrender ourselves to your
[1:20:44] will that your holy
[1:20:47] spirit will speak through
[1:20:50] us and hear through us
[1:20:54] and may that word be quickened in our
[1:20:57] hearts
[1:20:59] tonight in Jesus Christ's name we
[1:21:03] pray amen amen amen you may take your
[1:21:06] seats my
[1:21:10] brothers
[1:21:13] my as I said this is such a beautiful
[1:21:19] house as I went through the building
[1:21:24] I Saw the space
[1:21:27] downstairs and the space
[1:21:29] upstairs and to think of the glory of
[1:21:34] God to
[1:21:37] understand that God is in
[1:21:42] this you say what do you mean that that
[1:21:45] God is in this that I have to understand
[1:21:48] that God is in
[1:21:51] this
[1:21:54] when I was a young
[1:21:56] man I asked my dad a
[1:21:59] question about activating the promises
[1:22:03] of
[1:22:05] God now I can say with honestly I
[1:22:08] haven't followed the advice that was
[1:22:13] given in all
[1:22:16] aspects but I'll never forget what he
[1:22:20] said he said listen to this
[1:22:25] man he's a
[1:22:27] Jew and he
[1:22:29] knows how to activate the promises of
[1:22:34] God so I listened to the
[1:22:37] man and he's was a
[1:22:40] multi-millionaire approaching a
[1:22:42] billionaire in real
[1:22:48] estate and he said people ask me all the
[1:22:51] time The Secret of My Success
[1:22:56] and when I tell them what the secret
[1:22:59] is they basically
[1:23:02] say well if you don't want to tell me
[1:23:04] you could just say
[1:23:07] so you don't have to give me a silly
[1:23:12] answer but the answer that I give
[1:23:16] them is that I make God a partner in my
[1:23:21] business
[1:23:28] and then he goes on to explain now if
[1:23:30] they would ask me I would explain what I
[1:23:37] meant but people do not understand who
[1:23:40] invest in real
[1:23:45] estate is that you don't make your money
[1:23:48] when you
[1:23:51] sell you make your money when you
[1:23:57] buy if you buy a piece of real
[1:24:01] estate at fair market
[1:24:08] value you're not investing in real
[1:24:13] estate you're buying real
[1:24:18] estate now you have to wait
[1:24:21] years for the value of the property to
[1:24:24] go
[1:24:27] up before you can make any
[1:24:32] money so what I
[1:24:35] do is I find a property that I
[1:24:40] like I get it
[1:24:45] appraised I look around to see what
[1:24:47] other properties are selling in the
[1:24:51] neighborhood
[1:24:53] and I figure out what the good selling
[1:24:55] price
[1:25:00] is and I make my
[1:25:03] offer at 50 to 60% of the fair market
[1:25:12] value and I tell the
[1:25:15] lord
[1:25:16] lord business
[1:25:21] partner
[1:25:23] uh do you want to go and business with
[1:25:24] me on this piece of
[1:25:28] property if you
[1:25:31] do then they will accept the
[1:25:36] offer that I am
[1:25:39] giving and if you
[1:25:41] don't want to go and business with me on
[1:25:43] this
[1:25:45] property then they will not accept the
[1:25:50] offer now the key
[1:25:53] is not to fall in love with the
[1:25:58] property and when the answer comes back
[1:26:03] no you say well Lord I guess I'm going
[1:26:05] to do it on my
[1:26:09] own no you walk away from
[1:26:13] it because if the main partner doesn't
[1:26:17] want to be involved with
[1:26:21] it
[1:26:22] there's no use being invested in
[1:26:26] it so now when they accept my
[1:26:30] offer and it's amazing how many times
[1:26:33] they
[1:26:37] do I immediately divide the
[1:26:43] property and whatever percentage I
[1:26:45] offered the
[1:26:48] Lord 20 or 30 or 40% of the property
[1:26:55] I divide it I sell his part of
[1:27:00] it and I put the money in the
[1:27:04] church doesn't matter to me what they do
[1:27:07] with it that's not my
[1:27:11] business that's God's
[1:27:13] business what he wants to do with
[1:27:16] it and God has
[1:27:19] found that I am a faithful partner
[1:27:24] so I make more money than I can
[1:27:31] handle and when I sell my
[1:27:35] property and I make my
[1:27:39] profit I pay my
[1:27:43] tithes well you already gave the Lord
[1:27:46] his
[1:27:48] part No I gave him his part of the
[1:27:51] partnership
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:55] but I still have to pay tithing on my
[1:27:57] part of the
[1:28:01] game so I remember listening to that I
[1:28:04] remember listening
[1:28:06] to so that's how I
[1:28:09] know that God is a partner in this
[1:28:14] work because the offer that was given
[1:28:17] and
[1:28:20] accepted should not have been
[1:28:24] accepted unless God
[1:28:28] himself moved upon the hearts of the
[1:28:32] sellers to cause them to accept
[1:28:36] it and God basically
[1:28:39] said I'm putting in my percentage of
[1:28:43] this
[1:28:44] business as a down
[1:28:48] payment and getting rid of that big
[1:28:51] balance
[1:28:52] [Music]
[1:28:54] and you guys just take care of the
[1:28:58] rest what a awesome
[1:29:01] thing I'm sure you will hear specifics
[1:29:04] of of of the promises and the things
[1:29:07] that God
[1:29:11] did but the tremendous thing to
[1:29:16] understand is that God is
[1:29:19] here this building might look beautiful
[1:29:21] this building might look too big this
[1:29:23] building might look
[1:29:26] whatever but for some
[1:29:29] reason God moved every piece of the
[1:29:33] history of this
[1:29:37] church because he had found a faithful
[1:29:43] partner a partner who had been faithful
[1:29:46] in the little
[1:29:49] things that could now be trusted with
[1:29:51] with some bigger
[1:29:54] things because this is just the
[1:29:58] beginning of the great things God has in
[1:30:00] store for this
[1:30:03] area it it it makes me
[1:30:07] excited I get so excited it's it's
[1:30:09] almost hard to
[1:30:12] preach but I but I'll tell you this like
[1:30:16] my dad told me one
[1:30:18] time and my uncle Tommy really anchored
[1:30:22] down one
[1:30:24] time he said people Miss missed the
[1:30:28] greatest Revelations of the
[1:30:32] message because they don't listen to the
[1:30:35] tape until he starts his
[1:30:40] preaching they think that his
[1:30:44] greetings and his little stories that he
[1:30:48] tells don't really have a point
[1:30:52] but what they don't
[1:30:54] understand is that God is delivering a
[1:30:57] great
[1:31:00] mystery but just in a soft digestible
[1:31:05] manner so that those that are spiritual
[1:31:08] may catch
[1:31:10] it but those that are
[1:31:12] not won't choke on
[1:31:16] it one time brother Tommy he gave a a
[1:31:19] greeting at one of our conventions
[1:31:25] oh God what a
[1:31:27] greeting talking about the
[1:31:30] predestination talking about before the
[1:31:32] foundation of the world talking about
[1:31:36] and I was like my God what kind of a
[1:31:38] greeting is
[1:31:40] that I was sitting there enjoying it but
[1:31:47] wondering and then he
[1:31:49] says maybe because I was wondering
[1:31:54] you ever have that happen to
[1:31:55] you you have a man with discernment
[1:31:58] preaching the word of
[1:32:01] God and you ask a
[1:32:04] question and he answers
[1:32:08] it and he says this is the
[1:32:13] greeting that Paul gave the
[1:32:19] church and if it was good enough for
[1:32:24] it ought to be good enough for
[1:32:27] us I said amen amen glory to
[1:32:33] God now here here here let's let's try
[1:32:36] to right before I go into this I want
[1:32:39] to thank thank brother Titus for this
[1:32:41] opportunity to
[1:32:44] speak thank you
[1:32:46] brother we we we go back a long
[1:32:50] ways
[1:32:54] and um Tito was just a young man when I
[1:32:56] met
[1:32:59] him yet very
[1:33:02] young but never
[1:33:07] immature he was already a mature
[1:33:12] Minister when I met him if you was what
[1:33:14] 21
[1:33:15] maybe 18 years
[1:33:20] old me and brother Robert would talk
[1:33:22] about you a
[1:33:25] lot and we were just like man we can't
[1:33:28] wait to
[1:33:30] see what God is going to do through this
[1:33:35] man I mean he loved the Lord with all
[1:33:38] his
[1:33:39] heart he gave it his
[1:33:42] all he lived a clean
[1:33:46] life
[1:33:49] clean it was a joy to be
[1:33:53] around and brother we I just I I have
[1:33:56] loved seeing you throughout the
[1:34:00] years I mean who goes up and
[1:34:03] abandons who goes up and abandons your
[1:34:07] home your your father you could say
[1:34:11] that a Ministry already set
[1:34:15] up on the Council of a trusted
[1:34:20] minister
[1:34:22] very rare and then to
[1:34:25] come and then to
[1:34:27] come and to be
[1:34:31] steadfast and to and to lead the
[1:34:34] church and to do all that he can to
[1:34:38] further the
[1:34:42] gospel no wonder God would consider him
[1:34:45] a trusted
[1:34:48] partner and would provide him a a a
[1:34:52] place where he could further the Gospel
[1:34:54] of Jesus
[1:34:57] Christ I tell you you give some
[1:35:00] ministers a place like
[1:35:03] this it would go to their
[1:35:05] head before you know it they would have
[1:35:07] their own
[1:35:10] kingdom but that that won't happen
[1:35:13] here trusted
[1:35:17] partner God has his
[1:35:20] back God has the back of everyone who's
[1:35:23] living
[1:35:25] here who is pushing
[1:35:28] forward doing your little
[1:35:30] part in the kingdom of
[1:35:34] God amen
[1:35:37] amen I just love
[1:35:40] it so thank you brother
[1:35:43] Titus also see my buddy brother Tommy
[1:35:46] here God bless
[1:35:47] you this is this is the son of of my
[1:35:50] uncle Tommy I was talking
[1:35:53] about just in case you didn't know and
[1:35:55] Pastor Caleb God bless you it's always a
[1:35:57] pleasure to see
[1:35:59] you I saw me Jimmy Aly this
[1:36:02] morning he was at the
[1:36:05] breakfast and uh he said you all were
[1:36:09] here he said you were all
[1:36:13] here and I said okay well I have the
[1:36:16] hope that they're here and then I saw
[1:36:20] some at the park and they said I had the
[1:36:21] hope now I have the
[1:36:26] evidence there's something good about
[1:36:28] having the evidence
[1:36:30] right when the spies came back from
[1:36:34] Canaan they didn't come
[1:36:37] empty-handed they came with the
[1:36:40] evidence they said let me tell you
[1:36:44] something the grapes are
[1:36:48] sweet and if you don't believe me
[1:36:51] here's the
[1:36:54] evidence amen
[1:36:56] amen and I I want to thank my wife for
[1:36:58] coming with
[1:37:00] me I don't know where she's sitting but
[1:37:02] if you would please
[1:37:05] stand so you can see who she is thank
[1:37:07] you God bless
[1:37:09] you
[1:37:16] amen now my thought my thought is short
[1:37:20] tonight
[1:37:23] and
[1:37:24] um they almost always
[1:37:29] are but I was just thinking about this
[1:37:32] house and God providing
[1:37:36] it I was thinking about all the
[1:37:38] ministers and
[1:37:42] Ministries who have maybe worked hard
[1:37:44] all their
[1:37:49] life but um maybe they've never had a
[1:37:53] church that
[1:37:59] grew and uh I was remembering this
[1:38:03] scripture I was remembering this
[1:38:05] scripture in Psalms 12
[1:38:09] 127 except the Lord build a
[1:38:13] house they labor in vain that build
[1:38:20] it
[1:38:22] except the Lord keep the city The
[1:38:26] Watchmen waketh but in
[1:38:33] vain it is vain for you to rise up early
[1:38:36] to sit up late to eat the bread of
[1:38:39] Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved
[1:38:44] sleep for
[1:38:50] the
[1:38:55] and I begin to think you know that
[1:38:56] that's not just about a church or a
[1:39:02] house how many times have we spent
[1:39:05] sleepless
[1:39:09] nights our work never ends it seems like
[1:39:13] our work never
[1:39:15] ends at 12:00 at 1 o'clock at 2 o'clock
[1:39:19] we're still working trying to catch up
[1:39:21] trying to do the things we think need to
[1:39:22] be
[1:39:27] done we start getting up earlier and
[1:39:30] earlier trying to get a head start on
[1:39:31] the things we have to
[1:39:37] do we don't have time to take
[1:39:42] lunch we just grab a bread of
[1:39:49] Sorrow why
[1:39:53] it's vain no matter all the things that
[1:39:56] you're working is in
[1:39:58] vain and it comes to to my memory right
[1:40:03] now that they ask John
[1:40:06] Wesley John Wesley I think he used be
[1:40:08] saying he used to pay three hours in the
[1:40:11] morning and then go on his trips and
[1:40:14] then another three hours at
[1:40:19] night
[1:40:21] and God always helped him to get his
[1:40:23] things
[1:40:25] done and a man asked him one
[1:40:28] time what what do you do when you're too
[1:40:31] overwhelmed to pray three
[1:40:34] hours he said
[1:40:36] oh that's when I pray four
[1:40:42] hours what what a
[1:40:45] thing now the numbers might be
[1:40:49] wrong but the content of what he
[1:40:52] said the concept of what he
[1:40:55] said was is right when he had a tough
[1:41:00] day
[1:41:03] ahead he didn't skip on his prayer so he
[1:41:06] could get things
[1:41:11] done he prayed
[1:41:14] more because he
[1:41:16] understood he that labor labor in vain
[1:41:22] if God's not the one doing the
[1:41:32] work you can think about even even in
[1:41:36] this
[1:41:37] case the
[1:41:39] hours and the
[1:41:42] struggles
[1:41:45] investment to to purchase to buy a
[1:41:49] land to BU build
[1:41:51] something and the road blocks and the
[1:41:54] road blocks and the road
[1:41:57] blocks and the
[1:42:00] minute God does
[1:42:03] something the roadblocks
[1:42:07] disappear because the decision has
[1:42:09] already been
[1:42:11] set the destination has already been
[1:42:17] met my dad would tell me many
[1:42:19] times
[1:42:21] if the Lord tells you to go to Los
[1:42:25] Angeles go to Los
[1:42:28] Angeles it doesn't mean he wants you in
[1:42:30] Los
[1:42:32] Angeles along the
[1:42:34] road he probably going to
[1:42:37] say now turn left
[1:42:40] here and go to
[1:42:46] Bucky but if you're
[1:42:49] stuck I know the the lord gave this to
[1:42:52] me I know the Lord told me to do
[1:42:55] this yes but it may have been a
[1:42:59] directional
[1:43:01] push and you will
[1:43:04] know because you'll hear his voice
[1:43:08] again telling you turn to the
[1:43:12] right turn to the
[1:43:14] left now and my dad said he may not want
[1:43:18] to spend all the time telling you
[1:43:24] go down the
[1:43:25] Baseline turn right on Seventh
[1:43:28] Street get on the
[1:43:31] 17 then get on the 10
[1:43:34] West go to Los
[1:43:37] Angeles he knows I know how to get to
[1:43:39] Los
[1:43:41] Angeles I'll tell you along the
[1:43:44] way what you got to
[1:43:46] do don't fear don't fear don't fear
[1:43:51] he's been with you till
[1:43:54] now surely he will take you to the
[1:43:58] end his voice is in your
[1:44:01] ear he's still
[1:44:04] alive he still talks to his
[1:44:06] people amen
[1:44:09] amen
[1:44:11] now so who who who made all
[1:44:15] things
[1:44:17] God the psalmist says
[1:44:21] in 8 in in Psalm
[1:44:27] 8 how excellent is thy name in all the
[1:44:31] Earth who has set thy Glory above the
[1:44:39] heavens out of the mouth of babes and
[1:44:42] sucklings hast thou ordained strength
[1:44:44] because of thine enemies that thou
[1:44:46] mightest steal the enemy and the
[1:44:50] Avengers still means to
[1:45:02] stop now I don't know if you know
[1:45:05] this but that word
[1:45:09] still in the Hebrew
[1:45:13] language has a twofold
[1:45:16] meaning it means to shut
[1:45:19] up
[1:45:21] but it also means to remain
[1:45:26] motionless that's why in English is
[1:45:29] translated be
[1:45:33] still and in Spanish it translated to be
[1:45:40] quiet depending on how how the
[1:45:42] translator saw
[1:45:44] it but the text doesn't lie and it means
[1:45:47] the same
[1:45:49] thing mean shut
[1:45:51] up and sit
[1:45:54] down be
[1:45:56] still and don't
[1:45:59] move I knew one day I'd be able to quote
[1:46:02] my mama in a
[1:46:06] message how many of you m can say Amen
[1:46:08] to
[1:46:10] that be quiet sit down be
[1:46:19] still
[1:46:21] that's what he does to our
[1:46:29] enemies when I consider thy
[1:46:33] Heavens the work of thy
[1:46:38] fingers he didn't even have to use his
[1:46:40] arms or his hand or but the work of your
[1:46:45] fingers the moon and the stars which
[1:46:48] thou Hast ordained
[1:46:55] what is
[1:46:57] man that thou are mindful of
[1:47:02] him and the son of
[1:47:04] man that thou visites
[1:47:09] him okay now I'm GNA say
[1:47:12] something don't take it the wrong
[1:47:14] way and
[1:47:16] understand I'm going to make a
[1:47:18] distinction here
[1:47:22] between the son of
[1:47:26] man the office of the son of
[1:47:31] man and the son of
[1:47:39] man what what is the son of man what is
[1:47:41] the
[1:47:44] prophet he that the word of God comes
[1:47:49] to
[1:47:54] that
[1:47:56] house to which the word of God Has
[1:48:00] Come is the son of
[1:48:04] man so when you talk about God
[1:48:08] visiting all of you should include
[1:48:12] yourself and
[1:48:15] identify because Son of
[1:48:18] Man simply means God in
[1:48:25] flesh that's who that's who the word of
[1:48:28] God has come
[1:48:32] to the son of
[1:48:36] man for thou H has made him a little
[1:48:38] lower than the angels and has crowned
[1:48:41] him with Glory and
[1:48:49] Honor let's go to Hebrews
[1:48:55] 11 by faith Abraham when he was called
[1:48:59] to go out into a place which he should
[1:49:02] receive for an inheritance obeyed and he
[1:49:06] went out not knowing whether he
[1:49:17] went by faith he sojourned in the of
[1:49:20] Promise as in a strange country dwelling
[1:49:23] in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[1:49:25] Heirs with him of the same
[1:49:35] promise for he looked for a city which
[1:49:39] had
[1:49:40] foundations whose Builder and maker is
[1:49:48] God now I'm I'm gonna pre-venture
[1:49:52] here I'm gonna pre-venture
[1:49:59] here it it may
[1:50:02] be that God has given you a house of
[1:50:09] worship that you did not have to
[1:50:16] build because he wants you to
[1:50:19] concentrate
[1:50:22] on the
[1:50:24] house that you must
[1:50:28] build that he can
[1:50:32] inhabit see this building is not the
[1:50:35] real Church of
[1:50:37] God the real Church of
[1:50:40] God is the people in the
[1:50:44] [Music]
[1:50:46] building and no matter what you try to
[1:50:49] do
[1:50:50] it's in
[1:50:52] vain unless you let God build
[1:50:59] it brother how you
[1:51:02] doing oh man I'm trying so hard to live
[1:51:05] this
[1:51:07] word
[1:51:09] stop stop trying to live this
[1:51:15] word if you're having trouble re living
[1:51:18] this
[1:51:18] word
[1:51:21] your effort should be in receiving the
[1:51:23] new
[1:51:26] birth receiving the Holy
[1:51:28] Ghost having your nature
[1:51:32] changed because that is what God will
[1:51:35] do then God will build your
[1:51:43] life whose Builder and maker is
[1:51:48] God for the law Hebrews 10 for the
[1:51:54] law having a shadow of good things to
[1:51:59] come and not the very image of the
[1:52:02] things can never with those sacrifices
[1:52:05] which they offered year by year
[1:52:07] continually make the comers there unto
[1:52:17] perfect no matter what they tried under
[1:52:19] the law
[1:52:24] they can't make themselves
[1:52:29] perfect for then if they could have
[1:52:32] would they not have ceased to be offered
[1:52:34] because all because at the worshippers
[1:52:36] once Pur should have had no more
[1:52:40] conscience of
[1:52:48] sins
[1:52:50] but in those sacrifices there is
[1:52:53] Remembrance again made of sins every
[1:52:58] year for it is not possible that the
[1:53:00] blood of bulls and goats should take
[1:53:02] away the
[1:53:07] sins wherefore he when he cometh into
[1:53:10] the world he saith sacrifices and
[1:53:13] offering thou wouldest not but a body H
[1:53:17] has thou prepared me
[1:53:26] when he
[1:53:31] cometh when he
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:46] cometh the one you just read
[1:54:00] I said when he cometh and what did you
[1:54:07] say when he cometh when he
[1:54:13] cometh
[1:54:15] sacrifice
[1:54:18] offering thou wouldest
[1:54:22] not a body hast thou prepared
[1:54:27] me the mystical body of Jesus
[1:54:32] Christ must be
[1:54:36] prepared for when he
[1:54:40] cometh where're the body where're the
[1:54:43] Tabernacle that he has come to
[1:54:48] inhabit then said I lo in the in the in
[1:54:53] the writing I come to do thy will Lord

[1:54:58] establish the second verse
