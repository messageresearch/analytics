[28:25] a conquistador from a conqueror
[28:42] what a more
[28:56] joshua
[29:00] the bible says that he wasn't called
[29:02] that name
[29:04] he was called hosea
[29:08] significa it means
[29:23] jehovah is the one who makes salvation
[29:25] or is salvation

[29:30] that that joshua

[31:11] youth tiempo it's not time
[31:14] to surrender
[31:30] the people of israel
[31:43] joshua and caleb
[31:47] because they kept his word
[31:50] now let's go to joshua
[31:52] josue
[31:54] joshua
[31:58] deuteronomy says
[32:03] god was telling moses
[32:11] which standed before them
[32:24] for he shall cause israel
[32:46] for thou must go into the into this
[32:48] people into the land which the lord has
[32:50] sworn

[34:10] quitter i'm not you know
[34:15] i'm not going to give up
[35:03] [Applause]

[36:02] so will i be with thee
[36:06] amen
[36:10] they say
[36:51] so will i be with you
[37:10] i've never had much confidence anybody
[37:12] that's too afraid to do anything
[37:15] i'd much rather say
[37:19] be found i would rather
[37:34] the greatest
[38:02] uh
[38:16] that the balor phone company hired a man
[38:22] and he was going to sign his name
[38:25] and the man had no race lapis on the end
[38:28] of his pencils
[38:55] because if you make mistakes if you
[38:57] don't if you you don't make mistakes
[39:00] you won't do nothing
[39:02] that's true
[39:05] god
[39:07] hold you responsible for your mistakes
[39:11] you don't hold your response before your
[39:12] mistakes
[40:07] they used to sing a song that thrilled
[40:09] me they said
[40:10] go something like this
[40:15] and try me one more time
[40:17] i'll be yours
[40:19] if you'll be mine
[40:21] if i fall from
[40:41] is
[40:45] [Music]
[41:07] [Music]
[42:28] don't tell me
[43:05] [Music]
[43:37] young ladies young man
[43:40] [Music]
[44:32] wherewith thou shalt
[44:34] young man cleansed his way
[44:36] congratulations by keeping his word
[44:40] god bless you brothers
[44:43] [Applause]
[44:47] if i could please ask you to stand with
[44:49] me
[44:52] you know i believe if we come except
[44:54] expecting something from god
[44:58] god is more than happy to give it to you
[45:02] sometimes it just takes a little bit of
[45:04] believing
[45:07] a little bit of trusting in him
[45:10] sometimes we are so close to him
[45:14] god just asked a little bit more of you
[45:31] josue capitol uno first a and when you
[45:34] have you may say amen
[45:42] joshua chapter one says like this jose
[45:46] this book of the lost shall not depart
[45:48] out of thy mouth but you shall meditate
[45:51] their day and night
[45:52] that do make yourself serve due to the
[45:54] according to all that it is written
[45:56] therefore then you shall you shall make
[45:59] thy way prosperous and then do shall
[46:01] have a good success
[46:12] says
[46:20] i want to thank god for many things
[46:23] i want to thank him for allowing me to
[46:25] be here tonight
[46:37] and allow me to speak a little bit of
[46:39] of what god has given me yeah
[47:08] everything
[47:36] and in the story of joshua
[47:41] i noticed
[47:43] that one thing that josh had to have
[47:46] josue
[47:47] that he needed to have
[47:49] necessity
[48:04] it was people that were prepared for
[48:05] that battle person
[48:08] and they had fear of him
[48:12] of joshua
[48:15] no one could overcome him
[48:18] because what joshua had
[48:20] josue it was god by his side
[48:27] we have god by our side
[48:30] and there is nothing that can go against
[48:46] it was
[49:01] a thing against things that we cannot
[49:02] see with our eyes
[49:06] the bible says that our bad our fight is
[49:08] not against flesh and blood
[49:13] but it is against things that we don't
[49:14] see with our eyes
[49:17] against spirits of this world
[49:21] so we shouldn't be arguing with my
[49:22] brother or sister
[49:27] against certain things
[50:23] that we can show that there's a
[50:29] [Applause]
[50:34] but there is still hope for this world
[50:36] esperanza that god is still changing
[51:01] [Music]
[51:45] and he gives us the escape here brothers
[52:16] so much on god
[52:19] that we have the mind of christ
[52:22] that's the devil that the enemy brothers
[52:25] can i'll penetrate your thinking
[52:44] your mind has to
[53:12] but god is telling
[53:24] but when god truly comes to our lives
[53:54] finishes is itermina and we are back to
[53:57] our same life
[54:00] god doesn't want that youth
[54:02] he wants to dwell in you
[54:05] he wants he wants to live in you
[54:07] instead because when god lives in you
[54:11] when the holy spirit is truly in your
[54:13] heart
[54:16] you are sure
[54:18] what you are doing
[54:21] and the devil cannot cannot shake your
[54:35] is
[54:40] [Music]
[54:52] hey man i have a
[54:55] a message from brother branham
[54:59] random
[55:00] in the message word became flesh
[55:11] you know i believe that god is eternal
[55:13] amen
[55:15] and that he wants to live in us
[55:18] because he wants to give life to us
[55:23] just like this
[55:25] how eternal is the word of god
[55:30] all science will change
[55:59] then it
[56:00] is on to him
[56:03] it is the time to be brave enough
[56:06] to and carry this masters on
[56:10] because only a few of us
[56:13] will be able to carry this message on
[56:18] because this is not something easy
[56:19] brothers
[56:20] so we must fight to take what is ours
[56:25] you know joshua have to be brave and
[56:27] fight for what's happening
[56:39] then you must fight for what is yours
[56:53] when we meditate on god's word day and
[56:55] night
[57:37] when i realized
[57:39] everything else will pass away
[57:42] but there's one thing that won't pass
[57:44] away bro
[57:46] and that is god's word
[57:49] and you can take god's word
[58:20] and it
[58:48] against you in my
[58:50] that i still not in my heart against you
[58:55] but let me walk there
[58:58] you know i believe that god always has
[58:59] to be with us brothers
[59:02] now we
[1:00:09] is greater than any problem we have
[1:00:10] brothers
[1:00:12] you have
[1:00:26] the purpose of your life is
[1:00:29] he wants to to to manifest himself
[1:00:35] he needs brave people today
[1:00:38] how many want to be a few of those
[1:00:40] quantos
[1:00:48] [Applause]
[1:01:08] i'm very courageous
[1:01:12] notice that word vary
[1:01:15] i want you to focus on that a little bit
[1:01:20] my brother josue earlier described how a
[1:01:22] great responsibility
[1:01:28] because i believe it was a greater
[1:01:30] responsibility
[1:01:36] because it's easy to start something
[1:01:40] but it's a lot harder to finish it
[1:01:43] because once you start seeing the
[1:01:44] problems
[1:01:46] difficult things going on
[1:01:50] discouragement
[1:01:55] [Applause]
[1:02:03] but the great responsibility
[1:02:34] on the importance of a first-hand
[1:02:36] experience amen
[1:02:40] and i i feel it falls beautifully with
[1:02:42] what we're talking about today
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:03:12] and in the same manner with joshua
[1:03:32] to have a certain type of strength and
[1:03:34] courage
[1:03:39] because remember
[1:03:41] the only way that the word of god
[1:03:45] can have power
[1:03:48] is when it becomes flesh
[1:03:52] in ourselves and nosotros and me when
[1:03:55] our own lives cuando nuestras
[1:04:24] but
[1:04:51] [Music]
[1:05:19] you got no idea what
[1:05:34] as i was with moses
[1:05:40] he says only be thou strong and very
[1:05:42] courageous he says
[1:05:47] observe to do according to
[1:06:02] i don't care what the organizations say
[1:06:04] or do anyhow
[1:06:09] and i love this part
[1:06:11] that's the joshua that god is waiting
[1:06:14] for is
[1:06:26] [Applause]
[1:06:43] and how joshua himself
[1:06:46] had a first-hand experience
[1:06:50] it's very important youth is important
[1:06:53] that you have your own experiences
[1:06:57] not someone else telling you no algebra
[1:07:40] strength
[1:07:42] and courage
[1:07:44] to take a stand
[1:07:47] foolish
[1:07:51] to man
[1:07:53] what you're doing here tonight
[1:09:32] i want to talk to you about
[1:09:34] that strength and courage
[1:09:40] that joshua
[1:09:42] that is different
[1:09:46] to what man can say strength and courage
[1:09:48] is
[1:09:52] foreign because a thief
[1:09:54] needs a certain type of strength and
[1:09:56] courage
[1:09:58] necessary
[1:10:12] but the strength encouraged that our god
[1:10:14] was telling joshua
[1:10:20] it's not a physical noise
[1:10:23] it's not a mental courage
[1:10:27] it says in zechariah
[1:11:10] to
[1:11:24] is still not enough
[1:11:27] you want more
[1:11:29] you require of a higher life
[1:11:35] but it's needed of strength
[1:11:38] and
[1:12:05] that's why we need a different lifestyle
[1:12:20] to leave your phone
[1:12:23] in your parents bedroom
[1:12:26] when you're used to having it with you
[1:12:28] at night
[1:12:31] it's needed of strength and courage
[1:12:48] to be the
[1:13:02] a
[1:13:29] only in that experience
[1:13:33] personal experience yes i experienced it
[1:13:36] joshua knew josue
[1:13:38] that god was capable
[1:13:41] when god said in three days we crossed
[1:13:43] jordan
[1:13:55] right now the jordan river is at its
[1:13:56] highest right now
[1:14:22] although i still mean moses
[1:14:25] although i saw him with moses okay
[1:14:27] you'll love me that good moisture today
[1:14:29] i see him with me
[1:14:31] although i saw him with my prophets okay
[1:14:34] that could be professor william branham
[1:14:36] william brother although i saw him with
[1:14:38] my apostles
[1:14:40] call me apostle
[1:14:53] to be able to say
[1:15:08] that which the ministers had that's what
[1:15:10] was theirs
[1:15:13] that that the whole message thing when
[1:15:16] it first started
[1:15:19] it only stays back there
[1:15:22] it's very
[1:15:50] pero
[1:15:52] the sons and daughters of god
[1:16:00] to the world
[1:16:05] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:16:10] and in today's day
[1:16:13] it's very hard it's mudify
[1:16:16] to go against the current
[1:16:44] [Music]
[1:16:48] what the word of god says
[1:16:52] it's hard it's difficult it's heavy
[1:16:57] but with the right spirits
[1:16:59] correct spirits holy spirit that
[1:17:15] la fuerza encourage ila valentia
[1:17:18] to be different
[1:17:20] differentes
[1:17:21] to want to live a better life
[1:17:26] like i said in the beginning
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:18:00] [Music]
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:08] that the devil keeps on telling you
[1:18:10] diablo
