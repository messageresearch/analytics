truth is marching on thank you Hallelujah Gloria Dios Hermanos via the Internet we'll continue with the book of Samuel when you're happy if you please say Amen is in this evening a great privilege for the brother Alex was given as a title don't live by the appearances glory to God this is first Samuel chapter 16 verse 1 says and the Lord said unto Samuel how long will that mourn foresaw seeing I have rejected him for reigning over Israel fill thy fill thine horn with oil and go I will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemite for I have provided me a king among his sons he will kill me and the Lord said take and heifer with thee and say I I am come to sacrifice the Lord verse 3 and Call Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show thee what Thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto him whom I have name unto thee we're going to pray Santos lovely Heavenly Father evening father Jesus Christ of my mind and what I will speak can you make me aside use me fast so I can express your word bless the one I hear that's the one that speaketh Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Brothers a little bit on the word of God is that Sammy went with Isaiah to anoint the new king and don't say this is because the Lord has sent me to anoint a king down a little bit I'll jump to verse six this is and it came to pass that when they were come and he looked on a lab and said surely the Lord anointed to him is before him before him who said that Samuel said he was a prophet of that time but Samuel was also guided with this natural side that sometimes we Thomas that we're looking at the appearance don't live by appearances he was also wrong he saw him and saw that it was him and in verse 7 it says Mira Mira el hombre pues or in the height of a statue because I have refused him for the Lord see it not as man see it for the for a man look at on the hour of the prince but the Lord looketh on the hearts Gloria so we're seeing there que Samuel that's Samuel esta mirando was looking just as at his appearance how many times have us have we been wrong foreign means we're more worried we're not then what we are foreign when we go eat even the food so we're taking pictures you can see what we're eating oh good thing yes we're taking pictures we want to live by appearances we live by appearances or on the sidewalk apartment we don't even know who the owner is because we're living by appearances because we're always living by appearances the word of God says in Galatians foreign [Music] but Brothers we can hide from him Gloria dios glory to God I can see here is also living by appearances country they say is and they made that David get mad that's when you start the jealousy starts I love it when try to try to give glory to David they said so he got jealous Jesus in this thing the name of Jesus there's nothing in that correct what did God do to him evil spirits say hey David Without a Cause David could have turned his neck or slayed him a couple of times but he only let him he never said anything else he could have done it he went over there and cut a portion of his and he said look here see Saul also follow him all the time to kill David OS glory to God when David was anointed he took the kingdom he had to wait and many times we have to wait instantly right amen sometimes Brothers we act beforehand foreign vamos and when we go with our pastors and we say oh look I'm speaking to this young girl that she's not a good woman for him what does the youth do okay I want this is my advice here is that you don't marry but you you will serve for the consequences don't say no no uh listen to their password to their parents many times the consequences they get married to the young man or young lady that wasn't but what happens in time no sentient they don't understand as problems dramas happen and then they come with the pasture or my husband and then they go with God is listen to the voice of your of your dad you didn't wait for God to respond because we're not ready to listen or to wait in one occasion stand on it he went to go see his garden estaba is a branch with spines and and there was a warm walk uh going through there he said God this is not what I asked you foreign pray respect Grace okay but many of the people that are not from the fields they don't know how to Grace is when a woman eats is they they regurgitate it and begin to eat all the nutrients that we had that's how many times I think we should do with the word of God when we come here we eat it and we're over there at the house to take all of the nutrients because many times we let it pass Us by Gloria dios glory to God God bless you [Applause] man age this precious evening God bless the youth is there it's been a while since I got to speak to the youth is so I feel very happy to be able to um and I'd like to go a little deeper into David um I think a lot has been spoken on his victories I'd like to go a little deeper and perhaps go into some of his failures for thinking a little on David uh [Music] there are certain things that stand out that I can see um uh estamos mirando in in Lucas the story in life of David he is one of the things that stand out is the people of Israel saw a leader is they look for a king they wanted the king that was they wanted the king but it wasn't the way that God wanted a king they wanted a leader or a king that was like the king of the rest of the Nations that was outstanding the Bible says that he was a man who was very tall he was very attractive he was a perfect leader you'd choose mirando that this is a true leader man that's right looking at these uh two great characters here and I call it because he was safe it's always saved by grace pero we're looking at David a little youth difference I can see the differences in what God looks for in a person man looks on the exterior of man and God looks on the inside of man es you know youth brothers sisters we live in a time okay where everything is social media is a great platform for you to live a false life where you can live a life of appearance you can hide who you truly are you an appearance of being someone else is we're living in a very tremendous when I analyze the life of David he didn't care about the exterior much attention he didn't really look too much on how he looked at if he had paid attention to them your armor doesn't fit me make me one that does fit me David would have been concerned about his exterior appearance he would have worried what are you doing here why are you here are you confronting this great Giant maybe he would have gone discouraged personas because the people that are based on on hearsay or what people say about me very spiritual is where we show our true colors scratcher your person and you'll be able to to right and they're going to show what's inside of them appearances I see a man who was worried he lets his jealousies to invade his life I see a man who is worried because his kingdom is falling apart yeah yeah instead of seeking God instead of saying where have I failed me Lord tell us I know I didn't hear your voice instead of going to God he gets jealous of a young man appearances when I dig into the the person that David was I see a man important the most important thing he desired in his life is to have a relationship so close with God when we get to such a great desire a desire nothing else matters [Music] all right it doesn't matter what the people say it shouldn't matter to us who appear to be someone and one of the reasons is because of their self-esteem it's so low that are jealous to their own shadow who is this guy [Music] there are people like that Brothers there are other people that buska Vera Associated Society or a group of people that happens in church so I'm gonna pretend I have money there we are all in debt [Music] we don't have [Music] man wow oh and there's no no Korean suvida no foreign many people try to evade their realities the real parts of them and they appear seruna Persona to be a person but they know within them that they're not that type of person s this evening all of us at some point in our lives have tried to pretend something okay it's happened to me a lot of times I remember when I went to interview for a job I dressed very nicely and I tried to speak as best I could in the direction and I was going towards the interview I'm not going to stutter yeah and when they told me what can you off for this company I said what I'm not gonna fight him I want to find someone to fight him to confront that giant it's a bear to be sincere I am a sinner if I lord I can't get to you But Here I Am Lord look at David he was such a tremendous man that he says his words who can understand his errors and look at what he says close me thou me from Secret faults in other words so keep or to fix his errors that they were dark those things that you say oh it's not a problem but it is a man with Integrity towards God it's very sincere I see a man that raises up some Frenta and he comes face to face with the reality but he confronts a reality of a desire to serve God I think we have to get to the point in our lives it's going to take us far in our lives let me tell you sooner or later the disguise uh-huh que nosotroses that we sometimes similar later it's going to fall off great stories where one builds his life his house foreign I don't want to live a life of appearance I want to be true as David was nowadays not only them but all of us is difficile it's difficult to show who we truly are as but it's the only way God can help us deep into his character how the little things matter to him another trajectory another stage of his life when he was a fugitive yes I hope that brother speak of that fleeing we see who he truly was he was a man do things right what a tremendous person we need to get to the point we need to come to reality and be sincere is on that and you put aside the thought the word the mindset of who's going to say what try it God can use his youth brother sister because of our thoughts because of our perspective way of seeing things sometimes we're so such emotionally reactive sentimentality so sentimental Imagine David foreign to come forward meditate this evening on what's being spoken apariences appearances as her brother Hector said there are times the social media posts are so deceitful deceiving and you know the people that spend the most time on social media are so depressed hey it's not something real yeah I'm tired Church of living a double life of living a life of appearance we think we're so close to God but we're in fact in reality reading your Bible doesn't get you closer to God relationship with God it doesn't give you a relationship with God what are we doing when we go home okay look at your eyes when I am alone do I truly love God [Music] or is it just when I come to church [Music] I have my whole life I don't want to live a double life because I understand yes [Music] my insight my inner being here foreign so that when he looks at me that he speak well of me good of me [Music] I want to be real with God no real friends not real before you or simply be say I'm real quiero I want to be real when no one sees me when you are in private when you are alone did he know that you're standing for him this is precious
