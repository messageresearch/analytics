[24:03] amen glory to
[24:05] God thank you
[24:08] Jesus my dad used to
[24:11] say when he was preaching in
[24:14] church and my dad preached really
[24:19] hard my dad didn't cut no
[24:24] slack the word of God it cut going
[24:30] in and when you pulled it
[24:32] out it cut
[24:35] again but thank God for the balm and
[24:40] gel and my dad would
[24:42] say if you can say
[24:46] Amen at least say
[24:49] ouch amen amen there's power in the name
[24:53] of
[24:55] Jesus I look at the Bible
[24:58] I see all the great moments that took
[25:01] place in the word of
[25:03] God I think it would have been awesome
[25:05] to live in the time of
[25:09] David I would have been a friend of
[25:12] David I would have loved to see him
[25:14] knock that giant
[25:17] down to see the faith of this young
[25:21] man how he love God and how it offended
[25:26] him that uncircum cised
[25:31] Philistine would would would persecute
[25:34] the children of
[25:37] God but as glorious as that time
[25:41] was we are living in the most glorious
[25:43] age
[25:46] church and God thought enough about
[25:50] you that he let us live in this
[25:53] age we are a blessed
[25:56] people the devil knows that you know who
[26:00] doesn't know
[26:04] it we don't know
[26:06] it why because life has become so

[29:26] this
[29:27] morning
[29:29] Lord and if anybody ever needed you in
[29:30] this
[29:32] hour it is the Bride of Jesus
[29:35] Christ we have come this morning

[31:11] Christ amen amen God bless you welcome
[31:15] to the house of the
[31:18] Lord how many are happy to be here this
[31:22] morning yes sir well this this trip kind
[31:24] of backfired on
[31:26] us
[31:30] surprised
[31:32] us because my my my family told us we
[31:34] want to go visit brother
[31:37] T so we can go here and
[31:43] preach and that didn't work out very
[31:45] well brother
[31:48] Tito and and that that's the problem
[31:50] with being a
[31:52] minister that when you go visit a
[31:55] church they know you're coming
[31:58] they put you to
[32:00] preach and and I tried to sneak in the
[32:02] back
[32:05] door one time I went to visit brother
[32:07] Jimmy Garcia in San
[32:08] Diego Jimmy Garcia San Diego and I snuck
[32:11] him through the back
[32:13] door still got
[32:16] me so I just give
[32:18] up I'm not trying to
[32:21] hide but I'm also not trying to preach
[32:23] either
[32:25] brother but but in reality
[32:28] though sometimes it's good to hear
[32:30] somebody
[32:33] else not that I'm trying to lift myself
[32:36] up you
[32:37] know but as a pastor when I get a
[32:40] visiting
[32:42] Minister it's good for the people to
[32:44] hear
[32:46] him I've heard people
[32:49] say brother that was tremendous what
[32:52] what the visitor preached
[32:54] about and I'm
[32:56] thinking I just preached that last
[33:00] Sunday where were you
[33:03] at but we get so focused on you know we
[33:07] it become so common to
[33:10] us that when somebody else comes
[33:13] in it's good to hear from somebody
[33:17] else and and that tells us that God is
[33:20] speaking through all of
[33:23] us this is not my
[33:26] message but it was was sent to
[33:29] me amen amen I am not the
[33:33] founder but the founder knew
[33:36] me amen amen and
[33:39] so one
[33:41] message for the Bride of Jesus
[33:43] Christ and we're so glad to believeing
[33:45] in
[33:47] this amen if you'll open your Bible with
[33:50] me to the Book of Psalms chapter
[33:55] 51 this morning I was having technical
[33:57] problems
[34:01] um I couldn't get my my my page to open
[34:05] up I couldn't get my uh my word to to
[34:10] edit I tell brother we get so used to
[34:15] technology it's like the backup camera
[34:17] in the car I don't like
[34:21] those that's why you have view mirrors
[34:25] people use your view mirrors
[34:28] use the back
[34:30] one before you climb into the
[34:33] car check your
[34:36] surroundings do
[34:38] something amen cuz we get into the
[34:42] car back
[34:44] up beep beep what's that well someone
[34:48] standing behind the
[34:50] car we get so dependent on
[34:55] technology lazy
[35:00] now when you're
[35:01] driving and you get off the
[35:04] road the car
[35:06] vibrates it tells you you're going off
[35:09] the
[35:10] road and you get back
[35:13] on amen amen that's called
[35:17] education that's called
[35:19] technology that's called
[35:24] advancement and we get away from the
[35:26] word of God in simplicity
[35:30] but thank God for the message of the
[35:32] hour that it reminds
[35:35] us amen why we're
[35:38] here why we're going to go
[35:40] through and what is the Ultimate Prize
[35:43] at the
[35:44] end eternal life is awaiting you
[35:49] Church you have a reason to
[35:52] live when you die life will
[35:56] begin
[35:58] how many want to die this
[36:00] morning amen amen no no brother I
[36:04] haven't got married
[36:09] yet that was me when I was
[36:12] young and here I am I'm a grandpa
[36:16] now Psalms
[36:19] 5110 creat in me a clean heart oh God
[36:24] and renew a right Spirit Within Me
[36:31] verse 10
[36:48] 51 cast me not away from thy presence
[36:52] and take not thy Holy Spirit from
[36:56] me
[37:00] restore unto me the joy of my
[37:03] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[37:11] spirit the prophet said David had not
[37:14] lost his
[37:16] salvation he still had it what he had
[37:21] lost was the joy of his
[37:24] salvation how many of you had Joy when
[37:26] you first heard the
[37:29] message it was something new it was
[37:32] something that brought you to
[37:34] life don't ever lose that Joy
[37:38] Church one more Matthew
[37:44] 2411 the the title of this message is
[37:46] return unto
[37:51] me Matthew 24 verse
[37:56] 11 and many false prophets shall rise
[37:59] and shall deceive
[38:05] many and because iniquity shall abound
[38:09] the love of many shall wax
[38:15] cold but he that shall endure unto the
[38:18] end the same shall be
[38:25] saved Heavenly Father your word is
[38:30] blessed and now we have been
[38:33] blessed because we've heard your word
[38:37] father Lord take these words this
[38:39] morning
[38:40] Father and may they settle in our hearts
[38:43] Lord thank you Lord in the precious name
[38:46] of Jesus Christ we ask
[38:49] it amen amen you may be seated God bless
[38:53] you I'm sorry for keeping you standing
[38:55] for so long
[38:58] but I got to stand up too right
[39:01] now so share with me the this
[39:05] morning my my dad used to sco
[39:08] me
[39:10] goes sit him down right
[39:13] away I go Dad I got to stand up
[39:16] too yeah but you're preaching they're
[39:19] not they get tired I get tired
[39:24] too I never told him that I kept it in
[39:27] my
[39:29] mind because I respected my
[39:32] father he was a man to be
[39:34] respected not because he was my
[39:37] dad or because he was a
[39:39] pastor but because my father lived a
[39:44] life I was telling brother
[39:47] Tito my Dad loved this
[39:51] message it meant something to
[39:55] him he he Liv for
[39:59] he preached for this
[40:00] message he thanked God for this
[40:03] message he could wait to see the prophet
[40:05] again one more time he couldn't wait
[40:09] the he it meant something to
[40:13] him and when something means something
[40:15] to
[40:17] you you're willing to die for
[40:19] it you're willing to live for
[40:22] it you don't care what the world
[40:25] says you don't care if you get k kicked
[40:27] out of the
[40:29] assembly you have found
[40:32] something that is worth living
[40:34] [Applause]
[40:35] for amen amen that's right but the
[40:40] key is that
[40:42] Jesus you got to be in you
[40:46] first because
[40:48] Jesus recognizes his
[40:52] word that's why when the Rapture takes
[40:56] place
[40:58] and he comes to pick up his
[41:00] bride how will Christ know who his bride
[41:05] is they will have his spirit in
[41:10] them amen amen you know the natural
[41:14] types is
[41:18] spiritual a mother can have seven
[41:22] children 14

[49:48] amen verse 2413 of
[49:55] Matthew sorry Matthew 2413 it backwards
[49:59] Matthew
[50:02] 2413 but he that shall endure until the

[50:11] saved in in on the 12th
[50:15] verse it speaks how the love of many
[50:17] would wax
[50:20] cold now the word wax that's used in the
[50:24] verse of of of
[50:25] Matthew
[50:30] it's not to be confused with a
[50:32] candle when says
[50:35] wax
[50:37] amen it says the love of many will wax
[50:42] cold and and I found that in the
[50:45] Bible there are several types of wax in
[50:48] the
[50:53] Bible there's wax cold
[50:58] there's Wax
[51:01] Hot there's wax lean I don't know what

[51:20] worse and the definition of the of the
[51:23] word
[51:25] wax it's to grow
[51:28] old it it means to
[51:31] diminish we we might we understand that
[51:34] weak weak weakness or
[51:38] wickedness that in this
[51:40] hour
[51:42] wickedness would would
[51:44] increase
[51:47] wickedness amen amen it's going to get
[51:51] worse we're supposed to be an advanced
[51:55] Nation
[51:57] technology life should be
[52:00] easier there should be more time to
[52:03] pray there should be more time to listen

[52:08] message because now we got washing
[52:11] machines we got
[52:13] dryers amen

[53:41] were not caught
[53:42] [Applause]
[53:43] short no
[53:46] flesh would be saved but how is it

[55:29] now we say we have
[55:33] faith but we don't have
[55:36] faith faith
[55:38] cometh by the hearing of the
[55:41] word we hear the
[55:43] word but we're not hearing the
[55:47] word what
[55:50] oh my dad used my dad my dad would tell
[55:53] us after this
[55:55] message we get a copy of the
[55:58] tape and hear it
[56:00] again this was in this when we recorded
[56:02] on
[56:06] cassettes go he go go hear it
[56:09] again you think people did
[56:11] it a few here and
[56:14] there we we used to charge them a
[56:17] dollar but it was just to pay for the
[56:19] price of the
[56:20] cassette you know a dollar is nothing
[56:25] nowadays you got people that will go to
[56:28] Starbucks Starbucks and they'll
[56:32] pay5 can I get an
[56:35] amen
[56:37] five and they don't even ble a
[56:40] night go ahead and throw in three
[56:45] vanilla and your bill is
[56:48] $10 and then we come to
[56:51] church and we're looking for
[56:55] ones
[57:02] now if a one is all you
[57:05] have and that's all you can
[57:08] give you've given more than the one that
[57:10] has 40 in his give what you given
[57:17] more0 amen amen you you see our life
[57:21] here it's not matching up
[57:24] church I'm not saying don't go to
[57:27] Starbucks Starbucks we go to
[57:30] Starbucks Starbucks yes I get carel
[57:34] Mac yes I get three vanilla
[57:38] sces but when I come to
[57:40] church I do not put a dollar in
[57:44] it because I feel that if I can give
[57:47] Starbucks 10
[57:50] buckss give God
[57:55] 20
[57:57] and you don't have to flash
[58:00] [Music]
[58:02] it as long as God knows you did
[58:06] it all that
[58:11] matters I'm not preaching about tithing
[58:14] and offering
[58:16] okay but I would like to touch it a
[58:17] little bit
[58:19] though my dad didn't like preaching
[58:22] about
[58:23] it because he was the pastor and he
[58:26] thought if I preach
[58:30] tithing you're GNA think that I want
[58:33] your
[58:35] money because that's the carnal part of
[58:39] us but let's go back to the
[58:43] scripture the ones that don't
[58:45] tithe are
[58:50] thieves in the eyes of the
[58:53] Lord so it's not that we're we're to the
[58:56] to the pastor one more time we're not
[58:58] paying tit to the
[59:01] pastor bringing it to the
[59:03] church and then from the
[59:05] church they give the pastor a
[59:08] salary so you're paying tiing to the
[59:12] Lord so so my dad never liked to preach
[59:15] about
[59:16] that since I was the assistant
[59:20] pastor and I wasn't getting all the
[59:23] asmos you weren't I wasn't
[59:30] only the pastor got
[59:31] him I would speak about it you wouldn't
[59:34] I
[59:35] would because you want to be
[59:39] blessed if you want to be
[59:42] blessed Give the Lord his
[59:46] portion your
[59:47] portion is what allows to have the word
[59:50] preached in this
[59:53] church your offerings is what keeps the
[59:57] light
[59:58] on it's what keeps the door
[1:00:02] open it's not the government's job to
[1:00:05] keep the doors
[1:00:07] open it's your
[1:00:09] job and it shouldn't be a
[1:00:12] job it should be a
[1:00:15] joy they both start with a
[1:00:19] j one is
[1:00:22] Joy one is a
[1:00:24] job
[1:00:28] it should be a joy to have a place of
[1:00:32] worship amen
[1:00:36] amen am I doing good on
[1:00:40] time no time limit praise the
[1:00:44] Lord never tell that to a minister one
[1:00:47] more time never tell that to a
[1:00:51] minister brother take your time I got 21
[1:00:54] pages of notes
[1:00:57] I feel at home right
[1:00:59] now but I also
[1:01:02] realize we're also
[1:01:04] human we get
[1:01:06] tired okay amen but let's continue
[1:01:11] on I we were coming to church this
[1:01:14] morning we left Denver at
[1:01:19] 7:30 and uh we were there for a
[1:01:24] funeral and uh we we left this morning
[1:01:27] to be in with brother
[1:01:30] Tito and as we're coming up here we were
[1:01:34] hearing a message of brother
[1:01:36] Brandon it was preached on
[1:01:40] March uh the 17th I
[1:01:43] believe of
[1:01:46] 1963 and it was entitled the bridge
[1:01:49] between the seven Church ages and the
[1:01:51] Seven
[1:01:54] Seals
[1:01:57] and as we're
[1:01:59] driving I'm listening to the
[1:02:02] tape I'm watching the my fuel gaug
[1:02:04] because we're running low on
[1:02:08] fuel listening to my daughter gave me
[1:02:12] instructions that 12 more
[1:02:14] miles that seven more miles that this
[1:02:18] exit over
[1:02:19] here then we're seeing all all the
[1:02:21] construction along the highway you
[1:02:24] know really grown around
[1:02:28] here and then for some reason that new
[1:02:30] store
[1:02:33] bies it just seemed to stir some
[1:02:35] excitement in the
[1:02:38] car I don't know what's so great about a
[1:02:40] beaver but there was bies passing by you
[1:02:44] know and for these that are tracking it
[1:02:46] they open
[1:02:48] tomorrow okay and and so when all this
[1:02:52] going
[1:02:53] on and I'm listening to the prophet
[1:02:56] and while listening to him I started
[1:02:59] getting all these
[1:03:02] thoughts I like to call them
[1:03:04] inspirational
[1:03:08] thoughts because when you're hearing the
[1:03:10] message and you try to focus on that
[1:03:14] message there's always another message
[1:03:16] within that
[1:03:18] message that that's the word of
[1:03:21] God that's why it's a
[1:03:23] fountain even though it's sprinting out
[1:03:25] water
[1:03:27] it's coming out
[1:03:28] everywhere and and as we're driving down
[1:03:31] there that there's a part that caught my
[1:03:34] attention and it was paragraph
[1:03:38] 43 and brother Brian was speaking about
[1:03:41] malakiah
[1:03:43] 4 amen amen now we're talking about
[1:03:48] David where he says
[1:03:50] Lord return to
[1:03:52] me the joy of my salvation
[1:03:57] and I told you brother R said he never
[1:03:59] lost his
[1:04:02] salvation he lost the
[1:04:04] joy there's a
[1:04:06] difference you got to have that
[1:04:09] Joy when you come to the house of
[1:04:12] God you have to have that Joy
[1:04:14] Church I don't care if 15 people show
[1:04:18] up 100 show
[1:04:21] up you
[1:04:23] come with that Joy because it's you and
[1:04:30] Jesus all that
[1:04:32] matters is that he
[1:04:34] knows you are
[1:04:37] here amen
[1:04:39] amen now in my
[1:04:42] church I love it when everybody shows
[1:04:45] up because it makes my small Church look
[1:04:50] full I said wow wow we got a full house
[1:04:53] today I
[1:04:54] say lot of empty benches
[1:04:58] still but to me it's a full house
[1:05:02] because everybody that should be
[1:05:05] there is
[1:05:07] there and then my heart sens on
[1:05:11] Mondays when it's prayer meeting when
[1:05:14] it's prayer
[1:05:16] meeting and we all need
[1:05:20] prayer amen amen it's a powerful
[1:05:24] tool
[1:05:27] prayer well I'll wait till I get to
[1:05:29] church to
[1:05:30] pray you can pray at
[1:05:33] home you can pray at
[1:05:35] work when you're going through
[1:05:38] Starbucks Starbucks what you could be
[1:05:42] praying
[1:05:45] church amen you don't have to be on your
[1:05:47] knees my D you have to you don't have to
[1:05:50] be on your knees all day
[1:05:54] praying
[1:05:57] you can pray in your
[1:05:59] heart amen amen altar is right
[1:06:02] there and and and as we're going he
[1:06:06] begins to speak about malakiah
[1:06:08] 4 and he says there was supposed to be
[1:06:11] one to come in this hour he
[1:06:14] says here's the prophet speaking about
[1:06:18] Malachi
[1:06:19] 45 say one day God is going to
[1:06:24] send a prophet
[1:06:26] he's going to fulfill that
[1:06:29] scripture and he was the very
[1:06:32] one that Mal 4 was speaking
[1:06:36] of but this
[1:06:39] Prophet never
[1:06:42] bragged he never lifted up his you know
[1:06:45] me look at
[1:06:47] me you never hurting bragging when he
[1:06:51] created the squirrels he never what Hur
[1:06:54] him bragging
[1:06:59] no when he called him into
[1:07:01] existence when he stopped the
[1:07:04] storm he never
[1:07:06] brag he never brag when he made the cour
[1:07:08] going
[1:07:13] circles that took
[1:07:16] Faith wasn't
[1:07:19] witchcraft Hebrews
[1:07:21] 11 is not
[1:07:23] witchcraft it's faith
[1:07:26] these men that are like
[1:07:29] us with sub with with with the same with
[1:07:32] the same uh caral
[1:07:35] desires they had
[1:07:37] faith and by faith they
[1:07:41] overcome and here he was
[1:07:44] speaking and they caught my
[1:07:48] attention and he says and he is to be
[1:07:54] revealed by the Holy
[1:07:58] Spirit he's speaking about
[1:08:01] himself basically what he's
[1:08:04] saying is that one day it will be
[1:08:07] revealed to
[1:08:09] you that I am Mal
[1:08:13] 4 and the message that I'm
[1:08:16] bringing is not mine it's
[1:08:20] him I'm just the
[1:08:24] mouthpiece
[1:08:26] and The
[1:08:28] Works will will
[1:08:30] will
[1:08:32] vindicate that it's God speaking through
[1:08:37] man people today cannot
[1:08:41] understand how that we believe in a
[1:08:44] prophet because they
[1:08:46] think that we worship the
[1:08:50] prophet there's a different
[1:08:53] church he was a man like you and
[1:08:57] I amen amen he had faults
[1:09:03] too sometimes he
[1:09:06] lied amen amen the prophet
[1:09:10] lied oh no look look at
[1:09:14] Elijah but they were making fun of him
[1:09:16] because he was
[1:09:19] bald the human nature kicked
[1:09:22] in and he called two she bears
[1:09:28] and destroyed more than 40
[1:09:33] children God's Prophet did
[1:09:37] that he was a human
[1:09:39] being did God approve of
[1:09:42] it probably not but because he was a
[1:09:47] prophet God honored his
[1:09:53] words there's a difference
[1:09:57] between the
[1:09:58] natural and the
[1:10:01] spiritual amen
[1:10:03] amen and here brother
[1:10:07] speaking and he's saying one
[1:10:09] day the Holy
[1:10:11] Spirit Will Reveal to
[1:10:14] you that are part of the
[1:10:18] Bride that I was sent to the gentile
[1:10:24] people
[1:10:26] and he'll
[1:10:28] reveal the mysteries of
[1:10:32] God and restore the faith of the
[1:10:36] children back to the apostolic
[1:10:41] fathers and restore all the
[1:10:45] Mysteries that throughout all the
[1:10:48] ages they were only poked
[1:10:54] at
[1:10:56] amen amen but in this age all the
[1:11:01] Mysteries would be
[1:11:06] revealed a lot of people hate the
[1:11:09] Jews because they crucified Jesus
[1:11:12] Christ because they were waiting for
[1:11:14] him and when he showed up They Crucified
[1:11:20] him but it wasn't their
[1:11:23] fault the Bible says
[1:11:26] God blinded their
[1:11:29] eyes so that the gentile
[1:11:32] people which is you and
[1:11:34] I could have an
[1:11:37] opportunity we were looking for a
[1:11:41] messiah but the
[1:11:43] Messiah was looking for
[1:11:48] us that's why we're
[1:11:50] here we're not here to warm up the
[1:11:54] benches
[1:11:56] we're here because
[1:11:59] somebody thought about
[1:12:04] me I I had read in in in in in in the in
[1:12:07] the
[1:12:08] message one time when I was giv a Bible
[1:12:12] study that when the uh the uh the woman
[1:12:16] came to
[1:12:18] Jesus on behalf of her
[1:12:21] daughter and and Jesus
[1:12:23] said what I have for these
[1:12:27] Jews it's not fit for
[1:12:30] you it's not for the
[1:12:34] dogs how many of you would have gotone
[1:12:37] offended I don't need
[1:12:40] this call me a
[1:12:42] dog my attorney will be getting a hold
[1:12:45] of you me
[1:12:47] uh what's it what
[1:12:50] is you have offended me you've
[1:12:54] embarrassed me
[1:12:56] you call me a
[1:12:58] dog I got a friend a good friend he's a
[1:13:03] Catholic whenever we
[1:13:06] talk he tells me goes hey
[1:13:09] dog let's go have
[1:13:12] lunch I don't get
[1:13:14] offended I'm not a dog but I'll go for
[1:13:22] lunch but here Jesus
[1:13:25] calls her a
[1:13:27] dog that would have been
[1:13:30] enough for someone who's not
[1:13:34] predestinated to walk
[1:13:37] away I don't need
[1:13:39] this this is not for
[1:13:42] me but there was something in
[1:13:45] her there was a
[1:13:49] hungry she was born with a
[1:13:52] hungry and she said that's
[1:13:56] right I'm a
[1:13:58] dog but even the
[1:14:00] dogs eat the
[1:14:03] crumbs fall on the
[1:14:05] floor and I just want some
[1:14:09] crumbs and he said I've
[1:14:12] never seen Faith like
[1:14:16] this in a gentile
[1:14:20] woman brother Bram says at that moment
[1:14:25] it made the Holy
[1:14:27] Spirit made Jesus
[1:14:30] realize there was a gentile people down
[1:14:32] the
[1:14:34] road that needed to hear this
[1:14:38] message and that is
[1:14:40] me that is you that's us since
[1:14:44] our our
[1:14:47] forefathers they're waiting for you
[1:14:50] they're waiting for me to get in
[1:14:53] line because without
[1:14:56] us they cannot be
[1:14:58] perfect and without
[1:15:01] them we cannot be
[1:15:06] perfect when people say I was born by an
[1:15:10] accident ain't no accidents in this
[1:15:12] world
[1:15:15] Church you were born for a
[1:15:18] reason you were on God's
[1:15:22] mind in the beginning
[1:15:25] well I Don't
[1:15:27] Preach I don't read
[1:15:29] songs that
[1:15:32] woman said Lord even the dogs eat the
[1:15:36] crumbs she wasn't a minister she wasn't
[1:15:39] a song leader but the very words she
[1:15:43] spoke they Inspire us today
[1:15:49] Church the
[1:15:51] testimony of the Queen of
[1:15:53] Sheba it lives to
[1:15:55] today because a
[1:15:58] greater
[1:16:00] Solomon walks through here every
[1:16:03] service whether there's
[1:16:05] three or 100 it's the same greater than
[1:16:11] Solomon walk through
[1:16:14] here because where there's two or
[1:16:18] three in my
[1:16:20] name I will be there
[1:16:27] not I
[1:16:28] might I'll check my sked only three of
[1:16:32] you I need at least
[1:16:35] 12 or
[1:16:37] two or three are
[1:16:40] there in my name I will be
[1:16:45] there so when you come to church and you
[1:16:48] don't feel
[1:16:50] nothing don't blame the song
[1:16:53] leader well the message didn't inspire
[1:16:57] me well what church are you
[1:17:00] in amen amen because he is the same
[1:17:04] yesterday
[1:17:06] today and
[1:17:10] forever and if you live to be 120 years
[1:17:15] old and you
[1:17:17] die on that day that you
[1:17:20] die he's still the same
[1:17:23] yesterday today
[1:17:25] and
[1:17:26] forever doesn't
[1:17:30] change he'll
[1:17:32] restore all these
[1:17:36] Mysteries that's what the word
[1:17:39] says everything he
[1:17:44] preached it went back to the
[1:17:47] word this is our foundation
[1:17:50] church for
[1:17:52] Christian this is our foundation
[1:17:56] our
[1:17:58] founder is
[1:18:01] Jesus it's as simple as
[1:18:04] that and if he rose from the
[1:18:09] dead so will
[1:18:12] we amen amen how many are afraid to
[1:18:18] die I had a a Thea in the Apostolic
[1:18:22] Church her name was
[1:18:30] and the minute it would start
[1:18:35] thundering oh the blood of Christ she my
[1:18:38] grandma's
[1:18:39] house and run two blocks back to her
[1:18:44] house the blood of Christ when you talk
[1:18:46] about
[1:18:50] death the blood of Christ when we've
[1:18:52] been taught by a prophet
[1:18:56] that all death
[1:18:59] does is brings a child before
[1:19:04] God I brought another one
[1:19:07] home as much as I hate this
[1:19:11] job here's another
[1:19:15] one amen
[1:19:17] amen a Son of God should long for
[1:19:23] death but with the right mental
[1:19:29] attitude now as a
[1:19:32] human nobody wants to die this
[1:19:35] morning brother I just got a new
[1:19:39] job I finally got my
[1:19:42] raise let me enjoy my first
[1:19:47] paycheck that's the human
[1:19:53] carnality and he said
[1:19:56] that all the
[1:19:58] Mysteries at this time should be
[1:20:04] finished at the sounding of this
[1:20:10] messenger you know very rare did you
[1:20:12] hear Brother Bram
[1:20:16] say if you believe it to be his
[1:20:20] prophet in a prayer
[1:20:23] line very rarely did he say
[1:20:27] that but you have to have enough
[1:20:31] inspiration to
[1:20:33] know that before he even said
[1:20:35] it he's already a
[1:20:39] prophet amen
[1:20:41] amen and so I I was listening to this
[1:20:44] message and while I'm listening to
[1:20:47] it all these thoughts are coming
[1:20:50] in I must have pulled about four
[1:20:52] messages from that paragraph right there
[1:20:57] and
[1:20:59] unfortunately I was
[1:21:01] driving so I couldn't write them
[1:21:04] down and my memory is
[1:21:06] terrible but if I don't write it down
[1:21:10] it's
[1:21:12] gone I I I tell the church sometimes I
[1:21:15] wake up at 2 3 o' in the
[1:21:18] morning I can't sleep so I put on the
[1:21:21] tape of brother
[1:21:23] Brandon and within five minutes I fall
[1:21:28] asleep oh brother you fell asleep
[1:21:30] listening to the
[1:21:32] message I sure
[1:21:36] did first of all it's
[1:21:41] anointed it calms me it relaxes me it's
[1:21:46] like God singing to
[1:21:49] me rock my
[1:21:52] baby and I fall asleep
[1:21:57] the
[1:21:58] sin is falling asleep in
[1:22:02] church when they're playing a
[1:22:05] tape amen amen we should be
[1:22:08] alert am and when I'm listening to the
[1:22:12] tape I start preaching to in my mind I'm
[1:22:16] preaching I never wanted to be a
[1:22:19] minister never wanted to be a pastor I
[1:22:22] wanted nothing to do with that and here
[1:22:25] I am 60 years
[1:22:27] later at 2 o00 in the
[1:22:30] morning 3:00 in the morning and I'm
[1:22:34] preaching to
[1:22:38] myself and I start
[1:22:41] crying with the anointing that's
[1:22:44] there and I'm
[1:22:46] thinking
[1:22:48] brother maybe this message was for
[1:22:52] me amen
[1:22:54] and I wake up the next day
[1:22:59] for good amen amen why I heard the word
[1:23:05] of
[1:23:06] God satisfies
[1:23:08] me and that listen to this
[1:23:12] tape it reminded me of my
[1:23:19] father okay 58 let me close real quickly
[1:23:23] I reminded me of my dad Malachi
[1:23:27] 45 my father was an
[1:23:30] Apostolic he was a die heart
[1:23:35] Apostolic my grandfather on my mom's
[1:23:38] side was the
[1:23:41] bishop of four

[1:23:46] side my grandpa Nas
[1:23:49] Caso was a pastor of the churching be
[1:23:53] one more time of the pastor
[1:23:57] and my dad in the apostolic
[1:24:00] church had a
[1:24:03] revelation that God was going to send a
[1:24:06] prophet now they didn't preach that in
[1:24:08] Apostolic
[1:24:10] Church back then they didn't back then
[1:24:13] they
[1:24:14] didn't and much even less today will
[1:24:16] they even preach
[1:24:17] that because they've gone Wayward the
[1:24:20] Apostolic
[1:24:23] Church and my father had read Malachi
[1:24:28] 45 one day and he said
[1:24:33] huh Elijah the
[1:24:35] prophet is going to be
[1:24:38] sent and he began to
[1:24:41] pray he said
[1:24:43] Lord where is this
[1:24:47] Elijah he he was young like 23 24 years
[1:24:51] old Lord where is this Elijah

[1:31:12] fine
[1:31:14] religiously everybody
[1:31:16] singing clapping their hands you know he
[1:31:19] goes but the
[1:31:22] moment that that short bald man walk to
[1:31:25] the
[1:31:28] pulpit listen
[1:31:31] Church to to to have a spiritual
[1:31:35] Revelation you have to be
[1:31:38] spiritual look how many people walked in
[1:31:40] front of
[1:31:43] Jesus and they never recognized
[1:31:46] him this was the son of God and nobody
[1:31:50] recognized
[1:31:52] him not even his discip
[1:31:55] really
[1:31:57] realized who he was until after the
[1:32:01] upper
[1:32:04] room even
[1:32:06] Thomas said I will not believe him I
[1:32:10] will not
[1:32:11] believe until I can feel the holes in
[1:32:13] his
[1:32:17] hand the moment he goes that brother
[1:32:19] Branda walked to the
[1:32:22] pulpit he goes I started
[1:32:27] shaking with the
[1:32:29] presence that that man carried with
[1:32:32] him it wasn't the
[1:32:35] man it was God in the
[1:32:39] man there a
[1:32:41] difference God in a
[1:32:43] man that's why people got to a
[1:32:47] point that they started worshiping the
[1:32:51] prophet because they thought that he was
[1:32:53] God
[1:32:58] when we
[1:32:59] say Lord Let Me Be Like
[1:33:02] You the day that we get to that
[1:33:06] point that Jesus is leaving in you
[1:33:12] 100% the key not
[1:33:17] 99.9
[1:33:19] 100% the day that Christ is living in
[1:33:22] you the world will see something
[1:33:25] different in
[1:33:27] you you won't have to wear a
[1:33:30] t-shirt Jesus in

[1:33:56] me I want the world to see you in
[1:34:00] me how many want that this
[1:34:03] morning he says that through the whole
[1:34:07] service he
[1:34:09] shook with the presence of God he looked
[1:34:13] at my mother and she was
[1:34:16] shaken they could not control their
[1:34:19] knees just shaking with the
[1:34:22] presence people say

[1:34:39] powerful that he's
[1:34:42] holy and through the whole
[1:34:45] service my father was
[1:34:47] shaking with the presence of God that he
[1:34:51] couldn't contain himself he looked
[1:34:54] around nobody else was
[1:34:58] shaking he just looked at
[1:35:00] them my my father was a spiritual
[1:35:04] man because he prayed because he fasted
[1:35:08] because he read his
[1:35:09] word because he heard the
[1:35:12] message not
[1:35:14] once sometimes four
[1:35:17] times when he died and I walked into his
[1:35:21] office because now I had access to his
[1:35:26] office I didn't want it but now I got it
[1:35:30] and my mom would tell me
[1:35:32] me there's your dad's
[1:35:35] office use it and I began to look
[1:35:38] through all the tapes of brother
[1:35:41] brand he had every one of
[1:35:43] them and when a new one would come
[1:35:46] out he wanted
[1:35:50] it because maybe that
[1:35:52] message
[1:35:54] was something more he needed to
[1:35:57] hear and when I started looking through
[1:35:59] all these
[1:36:01] tapes some of them had two
[1:36:06] checks some had
[1:36:08] three some had
[1:36:11] four they all were
[1:36:13] marked they all had been
[1:36:16] heard and they
[1:36:18] reflected in his
[1:36:20] life not because he's my dad
[1:36:24] but the life was there
[1:36:26] church he had found
[1:36:28] something he had found a
[1:36:30] message and until the very last
[1:36:33] day he never lost that
[1:36:37] Joy when service was
[1:36:39] over he said Thank You
[1:36:42] Lord Elijah is
[1:36:46] here my father never got to hunt with
[1:36:50] him never got to go hunting with him
[1:36:54] never got to go to his house to
[1:36:57] visit never was good
[1:37:00] buddies but just with
[1:37:03] that that's all he
[1:37:06] needed to know that Malachi
[1:37:09] 45 had been
[1:37:12] fulfilled in his
[1:37:14] time and he believed it and he died
[1:37:18] believing
[1:37:19] it and he said one
[1:37:21] day I'll see the problem Prophet
[1:37:24] again there will be a resurrection
[1:37:28] church and then there'll be a
[1:37:31] Rapture God help us to not lose that
