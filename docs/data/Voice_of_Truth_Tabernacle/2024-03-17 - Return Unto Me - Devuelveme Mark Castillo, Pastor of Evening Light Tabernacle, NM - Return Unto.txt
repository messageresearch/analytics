life in the name of Jesus there's power in the name of Jesus and I am here because of Jesus this lips were made to praise him they were made to say amen amen glory to God thank you Jesus my dad used to say when he was preaching in church and my dad preached really hard my dad didn't cut no slack the word of God it cut going in and when you pulled it out it cut again but thank God for the balm and gel and my dad would say if you can say Amen at least say ouch amen amen there's power in the name of Jesus I look at the Bible I see all the great moments that took place in the word of God I think it would have been awesome to live in the time of David I would have been a friend of David I would have loved to see him knock that giant down to see the faith of this young man how he love God and how it offended him that uncircum cised Philistine would would would persecute the children of God but as glorious as that time was we are living in the most glorious age church and God thought enough about you that he let us live in this age we are a blessed people the devil knows that you know who doesn't know it we don't know it why because life has become so common Sunday Wednesday Sunday again convention special services Wednesday Sunday and here we are 2024 how many looking forward to 2044 I hope we're not here by then church because it's pretty ugly right now if we're not living in the days of Sodom and gomorra God help us church when they have to tell you you want to be a himm her or shim you pick I was born to be a Son of God and thanks to Jesus and the message of this hour it tells me who I am where I came from what I'm going to go through and where I'm going to end up church it's a big circle we are going back to Eternity how many want to be young forever how many feel young right now I just complet I just completed 30 the second time one more time I I feel good I try to look young you know but the reality I'm dying every day this flesh it's dying there was a time when I was a teenager never thought I would get to be 60 years old but here I am brother Cas what happened to you life I'm dying you can put all the cream you want they just came up with a new cream called F7 going to restore your skin put it on if you want you're still dying what matters the most is the man on the inside because he he was eternal in the beginning he'll never die church let this flesh die that's all right one day we're going home Church let us pray before we start precious Heavenly Father what a privilege to be in your house of worship for this world is falling apart when man has lost his mind we still have the mind of Christ this morning Lord and if anybody ever needed you in this hour it is the Bride of Jesus Christ we have come this morning Lord nothing that we can give you nothing that we can offer you except our heart this morning Lord you can take it and shape it Lord feel it Lord and use it father the honor of your glory Lord we know that your word is already blessed but we are the ones that need the blessing this morning bless the pastor of this church Lord give them more of your spirit father bless the ministry of this church Lord all those that stand at their post of Duty bless the congregation Lord and Lord if one day a stray would walk into the church whose heart is empty Lord as maybe reach the end of the Rope Lord may they find rest here father may they feel your spirit in this church father because I know that you are here this morning Father we felt you this morning and we feel you now Lord thank you Father we ask all these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you welcome to the house of the Lord how many are happy to be here this morning yes sir well this this trip kind of backfired on us surprised us because my my my family told us we want to go visit brother T so we can go here and preach and that didn't work out very well brother Tito and and that that's the problem with being a minister that when you go visit a church they know you're coming they put you to preach and and I tried to sneak in the back door one time I went to visit brother Jimmy Garcia in San Diego Jimmy Garcia San Diego and I snuck him through the back door still got me so I just give up I'm not trying to hide but I'm also not trying to preach either brother but but in reality though sometimes it's good to hear somebody else not that I'm trying to lift myself up you know but as a pastor when I get a visiting Minister it's good for the people to hear him I've heard people say brother that was tremendous what what the visitor preached about and I'm thinking I just preached that last Sunday where were you at but we get so focused on you know we it become so common to us that when somebody else comes in it's good to hear from somebody else and and that tells us that God is speaking through all of us this is not my message but it was was sent to me amen amen I am not the founder but the founder knew me amen amen and so one message for the Bride of Jesus Christ and we're so glad to believeing in this amen if you'll open your Bible with me to the Book of Psalms chapter 51 this morning I was having technical problems um I couldn't get my my my page to open up I couldn't get my uh my word to to edit I tell brother we get so used to technology it's like the backup camera in the car I don't like those that's why you have view mirrors people use your view mirrors use the back one before you climb into the car check your surroundings do something amen cuz we get into the car back up beep beep what's that well someone standing behind the car we get so dependent on technology lazy now when you're driving and you get off the road the car vibrates it tells you you're going off the road and you get back on amen amen that's called education that's called technology that's called advancement and we get away from the word of God in simplicity but thank God for the message of the hour that it reminds us amen why we're here why we're going to go through and what is the Ultimate Prize at the end eternal life is awaiting you Church you have a reason to live when you die life will begin how many want to die this morning amen amen no no brother I haven't got married yet that was me when I was young and here I am I'm a grandpa now Psalms 5110 creat in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit Within Me verse 10 51 cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me restore unto me the joy of my salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit the prophet said David had not lost his salvation he still had it what he had lost was the joy of his salvation how many of you had Joy when you first heard the message it was something new it was something that brought you to life don't ever lose that Joy Church one more Matthew 2411 the the title of this message is return unto me Matthew 24 verse 11 and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved Heavenly Father your word is blessed and now we have been blessed because we've heard your word father Lord take these words this morning Father and may they settle in our hearts Lord thank you Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ we ask it amen amen you may be seated God bless you I'm sorry for keeping you standing for so long but I got to stand up too right now so share with me the this morning my my dad used to sco me goes sit him down right away I go Dad I got to stand up too yeah but you're preaching they're not they get tired I get tired too I never told him that I kept it in my mind because I respected my father he was a man to be respected not because he was my dad or because he was a pastor but because my father lived a life I was telling brother Tito my Dad loved this message it meant something to him he he Liv for he preached for this message he thanked God for this message he could wait to see the prophet again one more time he couldn't wait the he it meant something to him and when something means something to you you're willing to die for it you're willing to live for it you don't care what the world says you don't care if you get k kicked out of the assembly you have found something that is worth living [Applause] for amen amen that's right but the key is that Jesus you got to be in you first because Jesus recognizes his word that's why when the Rapture takes place and he comes to pick up his bride how will Christ know who his bride is they will have his spirit in them amen amen you know the natural types is spiritual a mother can have seven children 14 children and go to the store and when one of them gets lost and begins to cry out that mother will recognize that cry youever thought about that how do I know that happened in my church a sister had five children went to the mall in Phoenix Phoenix one of the boys got lost she panicked he started crying out she recognized the cry and she found him and then they went to another store and he got lost again he cried out and she found him thank God that in this hour when we were crying out somebody found somebody heard my cry the family couldn't hear it the neighbor couldn't hear it but Jesus heard it we were born with a hungering we were born with a thirsting something that could satisfy the soul because to satisfy the flesh it's very easy how many of you have ever had the joy of a brand new vehicle when you buy a brand new vehicle you don't want nobody touching it brother brother it's my Mustang oh Mustang no food in my car no drinks I don't like my car spound like McDonald's it's my car don't touch it when you get in keep your hands down don't be Joy on the Windows when we were growing up and the windows would fog up in the back God God forbid that you put a smile face on there my dad would put a frown on you if he did that get your fingers away from that window what's wrong with you why it's my vehicle it's the joy it's brand new it cost me I got to pay for it now I got to buy insurance I got to put gas you ain't helping me it's mine don't touch it just go around it for and then a year passes by two years after a while you open the the back seat wrappers from McDonald's mdon a dried up french fry like that Joy is gone why it's a Earthly Joy you'll never find joy in this world you'll never find joy in the things of this world the only joy a Son of God has is to be in the house of the Lord is to worship him it's to use these lips to praise him well the neighbors going to hear me let them hear me I'm not here for the neighbor you know I've been in this message for years and I learned something last from Brother Fabi he said he called me viito I don't know why I mean I use cream on my face too you know go old he said old man when we come to the house of God it's you and Jesus when I came this morning I didn't come to see brother Tito the family would the family would have loved to hear him preach but I came to see Jesus and how do I see Jesus you amen I see him in you that that's what draws together that same Spirit doesn't matter what church you go to doesn't matter how they worship they don't sing the songs right that's okay sing it anyways that same spirit is what should unite the Bride of Jesus Christ the prophet says that when the squeeze comes it's going to unite the bride why does it take a squeeze to do that why why can't we unite now you know within the message churches there should be no [Applause] barriers One messenger the seven Sur messenger one message it still hasn't changed you go back to the tapes the tapes haven't changed it's the same message it's the same Prophet speaking it the same anointing people are looking for something new all the time we shouldn't have to we shouldn't have to pick up something new to to to to to to encourage the people new programs God bless you for this bigger place there's nothing like having your own church God bless you for having this place and may it fill it with more message [Music] Believers God help us in this hour it shouldn't take that have to be that way it's still here church people will say well I already heard heard that message go hear it again you had breakfast yesterday why do you have to have it today or tomorrow or Tuesday what is enough oh no brother got to have breakfast every day lunch every day every day and then a midnight snack before I go to bed amen amen but the word of God we become conformed with just hearing it one time I guarantee that you go back and hear it again say again I guarantee you're gonna find something new because this never gets old the one that gets old is you and me but it never gets old every day it's fresh Mana why it's Eternal the word of God amen amen verse 2413 of Matthew sorry Matthew 2413 it backwards Matthew 2413 but he that shall endure until the end the same shall be saved in in on the 12th verse it speaks how the love of many would wax cold now the word wax that's used in the verse of of of Matthew it's not to be confused with a candle when says wax amen it says the love of many will wax cold and and I found that in the Bible there are several types of wax in the Bible there's wax cold there's Wax Hot there's wax lean I don't know what that is lean wax lean weak oh pardon devil there's wax old there's even wax worse and the definition of the of the word wax it's to grow old it it means to diminish we we might we understand that weak weak weakness or wickedness that in this hour wickedness would would increase wickedness amen amen it's going to get worse we're supposed to be an advanced Nation technology life should be easier there should be more time to pray there should be more time to listen to a message because now we got washing machines we got dryers amen amen you don't have to go to the river to wash clothes anymore you just push a button when people tell me I've been washing clothes all day long I'm thinking what Hot River are you at there must have been a line there Wasing all day long I spent the whole daying washing and drying now now you push a button heavy load and extra hot warm water the rins delicate fluff it up make it fluffy and then you push a button and you walk away I've been washing all day brother and no time to pray to read the word of God why the day goes by so fast and the Bible says that if the days were not caught [Applause] short no flesh would be saved but how is it impossible we have a glorious message God sent a powerful prophet to preach this message how can the people wax cold it's a good question because God don't change he says I am God and I change not we change we adapt we adapt to life made us adapt to a lot of many things before people would cough nobody cared kep on talking you know now somebody coughs six feet please you know what offended me during Co when I meet a brother and he go God bless you brother I thought oh my God how did Jesus do it when he went to the [Applause] lepers you either believe in him who or you don't or no amen amen but we become you know protective now we say we have faith but we don't have faith faith cometh by the hearing of the word we hear the word but we're not hearing the word what oh my dad used my dad my dad would tell us after this message we get a copy of the tape and hear it again this was in this when we recorded on cassettes go he go go hear it again you think people did it a few here and there we we used to charge them a dollar but it was just to pay for the price of the cassette you know a dollar is nothing nowadays you got people that will go to Starbucks Starbucks and they'll pay5 can I get an amen five and they don't even ble a night go ahead and throw in three vanilla and your bill is $10 and then we come to church and we're looking for ones now if a one is all you have and that's all you can give you've given more than the one that has 40 in his give what you given more0 amen amen you you see our life here it's not matching up church I'm not saying don't go to Starbucks Starbucks we go to Starbucks Starbucks yes I get carel Mac yes I get three vanilla sces but when I come to church I do not put a dollar in it because I feel that if I can give Starbucks 10 buckss give God 20 and you don't have to flash [Music] it as long as God knows you did it all that matters I'm not preaching about tithing and offering okay but I would like to touch it a little bit though my dad didn't like preaching about it because he was the pastor and he thought if I preach tithing you're GNA think that I want your money because that's the carnal part of us but let's go back to the scripture the ones that don't tithe are thieves in the eyes of the Lord so it's not that we're we're to the to the pastor one more time we're not paying tit to the pastor bringing it to the church and then from the church they give the pastor a salary so you're paying tiing to the Lord so so my dad never liked to preach about that since I was the assistant pastor and I wasn't getting all the asmos you weren't I wasn't only the pastor got him I would speak about it you wouldn't I would because you want to be blessed if you want to be blessed Give the Lord his portion your portion is what allows to have the word preached in this church your offerings is what keeps the light on it's what keeps the door open it's not the government's job to keep the doors open it's your job and it shouldn't be a job it should be a joy they both start with a j one is Joy one is a job it should be a joy to have a place of worship amen amen am I doing good on time no time limit praise the Lord never tell that to a minister one more time never tell that to a minister brother take your time I got 21 pages of notes I feel at home right now but I also realize we're also human we get tired okay amen but let's continue on I we were coming to church this morning we left Denver at 7:30 and uh we were there for a funeral and uh we we left this morning to be in with brother Tito and as we're coming up here we were hearing a message of brother Brandon it was preached on March uh the 17th I believe of 1963 and it was entitled the bridge between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals and as we're driving I'm listening to the tape I'm watching the my fuel gaug because we're running low on fuel listening to my daughter gave me instructions that 12 more miles that seven more miles that this exit over here then we're seeing all all the construction along the highway you know really grown around here and then for some reason that new store bies it just seemed to stir some excitement in the car I don't know what's so great about a beaver but there was bies passing by you know and for these that are tracking it they open tomorrow okay and and so when all this going on and I'm listening to the prophet and while listening to him I started getting all these thoughts I like to call them inspirational thoughts because when you're hearing the message and you try to focus on that message there's always another message within that message that that's the word of God that's why it's a fountain even though it's sprinting out water it's coming out everywhere and and as we're driving down there that there's a part that caught my attention and it was paragraph 43 and brother Brian was speaking about malakiah 4 amen amen now we're talking about David where he says Lord return to me the joy of my salvation and I told you brother R said he never lost his salvation he lost the joy there's a difference you got to have that Joy when you come to the house of God you have to have that Joy Church I don't care if 15 people show up 100 show up you come with that Joy because it's you and Jesus all that matters is that he knows you are here amen amen now in my church I love it when everybody shows up because it makes my small Church look full I said wow wow we got a full house today I say lot of empty benches still but to me it's a full house because everybody that should be there is there and then my heart sens on Mondays when it's prayer meeting when it's prayer meeting and we all need prayer amen amen it's a powerful tool prayer well I'll wait till I get to church to pray you can pray at home you can pray at work when you're going through Starbucks Starbucks what you could be praying church amen you don't have to be on your knees my D you have to you don't have to be on your knees all day praying you can pray in your heart amen amen altar is right there and and and as we're going he begins to speak about malakiah 4 and he says there was supposed to be one to come in this hour he says here's the prophet speaking about Malachi 45 say one day God is going to send a prophet he's going to fulfill that scripture and he was the very one that Mal 4 was speaking of but this Prophet never bragged he never lifted up his you know me look at me you never hurting bragging when he created the squirrels he never what Hur him bragging no when he called him into existence when he stopped the storm he never brag he never brag when he made the cour going circles that took Faith wasn't witchcraft Hebrews 11 is not witchcraft it's faith these men that are like us with sub with with with the same with the same uh caral desires they had faith and by faith they overcome and here he was speaking and they caught my attention and he says and he is to be revealed by the Holy Spirit he's speaking about himself basically what he's saying is that one day it will be revealed to you that I am Mal 4 and the message that I'm bringing is not mine it's him I'm just the mouthpiece and The Works will will will vindicate that it's God speaking through man people today cannot understand how that we believe in a prophet because they think that we worship the prophet there's a different church he was a man like you and I amen amen he had faults too sometimes he lied amen amen the prophet lied oh no look look at Elijah but they were making fun of him because he was bald the human nature kicked in and he called two she bears and destroyed more than 40 children God's Prophet did that he was a human being did God approve of it probably not but because he was a prophet God honored his words there's a difference between the natural and the spiritual amen amen and here brother speaking and he's saying one day the Holy Spirit Will Reveal to you that are part of the Bride that I was sent to the gentile people and he'll reveal the mysteries of God and restore the faith of the children back to the apostolic fathers and restore all the Mysteries that throughout all the ages they were only poked at amen amen but in this age all the Mysteries would be revealed a lot of people hate the Jews because they crucified Jesus Christ because they were waiting for him and when he showed up They Crucified him but it wasn't their fault the Bible says God blinded their eyes so that the gentile people which is you and I could have an opportunity we were looking for a messiah but the Messiah was looking for us that's why we're here we're not here to warm up the benches we're here because somebody thought about me I I had read in in in in in in the in the message one time when I was giv a Bible study that when the uh the uh the woman came to Jesus on behalf of her daughter and and Jesus said what I have for these Jews it's not fit for you it's not for the dogs how many of you would have gotone offended I don't need this call me a dog my attorney will be getting a hold of you me uh what's it what is you have offended me you've embarrassed me you call me a dog I got a friend a good friend he's a Catholic whenever we talk he tells me goes hey dog let's go have lunch I don't get offended I'm not a dog but I'll go for lunch but here Jesus calls her a dog that would have been enough for someone who's not predestinated to walk away I don't need this this is not for me but there was something in her there was a hungry she was born with a hungry and she said that's right I'm a dog but even the dogs eat the crumbs fall on the floor and I just want some crumbs and he said I've never seen Faith like this in a gentile woman brother Bram says at that moment it made the Holy Spirit made Jesus realize there was a gentile people down the road that needed to hear this message and that is me that is you that's us since our our forefathers they're waiting for you they're waiting for me to get in line because without us they cannot be perfect and without them we cannot be perfect when people say I was born by an accident ain't no accidents in this world Church you were born for a reason you were on God's mind in the beginning well I Don't Preach I don't read songs that woman said Lord even the dogs eat the crumbs she wasn't a minister she wasn't a song leader but the very words she spoke they Inspire us today Church the testimony of the Queen of Sheba it lives to today because a greater Solomon walks through here every service whether there's three or 100 it's the same greater than Solomon walk through here because where there's two or three in my name I will be there not I might I'll check my sked only three of you I need at least 12 or two or three are there in my name I will be there so when you come to church and you don't feel nothing don't blame the song leader well the message didn't inspire me well what church are you in amen amen because he is the same yesterday today and forever and if you live to be 120 years old and you die on that day that you die he's still the same yesterday today and forever doesn't change he'll restore all these Mysteries that's what the word says everything he preached it went back to the word this is our foundation church for Christian this is our foundation our founder is Jesus it's as simple as that and if he rose from the dead so will we amen amen how many are afraid to die I had a a Thea in the Apostolic Church her name was and the minute it would start thundering oh the blood of Christ she my grandma's house and run two blocks back to her house the blood of Christ when you talk about death the blood of Christ when we've been taught by a prophet that all death does is brings a child before God I brought another one home as much as I hate this job here's another one amen amen a Son of God should long for death but with the right mental attitude now as a human nobody wants to die this morning brother I just got a new job I finally got my raise let me enjoy my first paycheck that's the human carnality and he said that all the Mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this messenger you know very rare did you hear Brother Bram say if you believe it to be his prophet in a prayer line very rarely did he say that but you have to have enough inspiration to know that before he even said it he's already a prophet amen amen and so I I was listening to this message and while I'm listening to it all these thoughts are coming in I must have pulled about four messages from that paragraph right there and unfortunately I was driving so I couldn't write them down and my memory is terrible but if I don't write it down it's gone I I I tell the church sometimes I wake up at 2 3 o' in the morning I can't sleep so I put on the tape of brother Brandon and within five minutes I fall asleep oh brother you fell asleep listening to the message I sure did first of all it's anointed it calms me it relaxes me it's like God singing to me rock my baby and I fall asleep the sin is falling asleep in church when they're playing a tape amen amen we should be alert am and when I'm listening to the tape I start preaching to in my mind I'm preaching I never wanted to be a minister never wanted to be a pastor I wanted nothing to do with that and here I am 60 years later at 2 o00 in the morning 3:00 in the morning and I'm preaching to myself and I start crying with the anointing that's there and I'm thinking brother maybe this message was for me amen and I wake up the next day for good amen amen why I heard the word of God satisfies me and that listen to this tape it reminded me of my father okay 58 let me close real quickly I reminded me of my dad Malachi 45 my father was an Apostolic he was a die heart Apostolic my grandfather on my mom's side was the bishop of four states on my dad's side my grandpa Nas Caso was a pastor of the churching be one more time of the pastor and my dad in the apostolic church had a revelation that God was going to send a prophet now they didn't preach that in Apostolic Church back then they didn't back then they didn't and much even less today will they even preach that because they've gone Wayward the Apostolic Church and my father had read Malachi 45 one day and he said huh Elijah the prophet is going to be sent and he began to pray he said Lord where is this Elijah he he was young like 23 24 years old Lord where is this Elijah when I looked at the date of this message it was preached on March the 17 um in uh of 63 one month before brother BR was in Albuquerque Albuquerque brother BR was in Albuquerque on April the 12th BR in alquerque and he preached two messages that day the morning he preached the world is falling apart news flash Church the world has fallen apart and then in the evening he preached God hiding himself in Simplicity both on April the 12th that week that that week the apostolics were having a Revival in Albuquerque and brother Bernie Garcia y all know who he is he tells my dad he goes He Nick Nick did you know that there's a brother Bram here in Albuquerque and he's preaching at Western Skies Western Skies my dad really he goes let's go and my dad and my mom took off they left the Revival they took off to to Western Skies Western Skies brother Bernie and his wife they took off also brother Mike per and his wife they took off and the Evangelist That was supposed to preach in the evening took off also now here's my dad his father-in-law is the bishop there at that service but my dad had a cry in him he was waiting for Elijah and he had to go to that service they went to Western Skies Wern SK when they got there the place was packed with people the apostolics had one fault they was always late to church amen Amen Brother P is that right you know you from there that's what the prophet taught us church church order come 30 minutes early meditate get rid of all the you know lifely thoughts beans that are on the grill the beans they'll be all right but come to church and get in the spirit amen amen well my my dad when they got there it was packed my dad does not like to be late he does not like to be late we leave 15 ft from the church the pastor's house and my dad would tell us as young people don't you be late you be there early I better not see you show up late to church I better not see you show up late to church only 15 ft away from the church you better not be late to church while they got there it was packed one of the ushers saw my dad in the back back and he called him to the front and there was two seats there out of the whole pack building and my dad sat there with my mom look at the predestination of God if you're seeking something from him God will give you the desire of your heart it might take a while but he'll give it to you my mother waited 27 years for the prodical son to come back home my brother left the house I'm not going to tell you his name to protect the innocent but he left home to go seek his fortune in the world his pot of gold pot of gold my dad said me home your brother left the house to go look for his pot of gold and it was here all the time 27 years he took off made good money we expensive clothing he he would blink to spend 90 bucks for a shirt 90 bucks for a shirt it's craziness 300 for shoes craziness he's one of those guys that had a truck you couldn't touch wi hands my truck W don't scratch it w hey don't don't scratch my truck I go hey bro can I borrow your truck for what go get some rocks are you crazy bro my truck one day a tree fell in his truck and it wiped it out my dad sat there with my mom he said service was fine religiously everybody singing clapping their hands you know he goes but the moment that that short bald man walk to the pulpit listen Church to to to have a spiritual Revelation you have to be spiritual look how many people walked in front of Jesus and they never recognized him this was the son of God and nobody recognized him not even his discip really realized who he was until after the upper room even Thomas said I will not believe him I will not believe until I can feel the holes in his hand the moment he goes that brother Branda walked to the pulpit he goes I started shaking with the presence that that man carried with him it wasn't the man it was God in the man there a difference God in a man that's why people got to a point that they started worshiping the prophet because they thought that he was God when we say Lord Let Me Be Like You the day that we get to that point that Jesus is leaving in you 100% the key not 99.9 100% the day that Christ is living in you the world will see something different in you you won't have to wear a t-shirt Jesus in me check it out this is Jesus in me no you won't have to the life you live say it all church amen amen that's why when you say Lord live in me I want the world to see you in me how many want that this morning he says that through the whole service he shook with the presence of God he looked at my mother and she was shaken they could not control their knees just shaking with the presence people say Lord I would love for you to talk to me I would love to see you right here you couldn't stand his presence chch it make you shake to realize that he's powerful that he's holy and through the whole service my father was shaking with the presence of God that he couldn't contain himself he looked around nobody else was shaking he just looked at them my my father was a spiritual man because he prayed because he fasted because he read his word because he heard the message not once sometimes four times when he died and I walked into his office because now I had access to his office I didn't want it but now I got it and my mom would tell me me there's your dad's office use it and I began to look through all the tapes of brother brand he had every one of them and when a new one would come out he wanted it because maybe that message was something more he needed to hear and when I started looking through all these tapes some of them had two checks some had three some had four they all were marked they all had been heard and they reflected in his life not because he's my dad but the life was there church he had found something he had found a message and until the very last day he never lost that Joy when service was over he said Thank You Lord Elijah is here my father never got to hunt with him never got to go hunting with him never got to go to his house to visit never was good buddies but just with that that's all he needed to know that Malachi 45 had been fulfilled in his time and he believed it and he died believing it and he said one day I'll see the problem Prophet again there will be a resurrection church and then there'll be a Rapture God help us to not lose that Joy let us stand to our feet heavenly father thank you Jesus Lord for your word father for the inspiration that it gives us in knowing that you are still the same your word is unchanging father I commit your people into your hands those that are listening far off that they may
