all day long christ jesus paid a debt that i could never [Music] if you can follow me open up your bibles to the book of acts 7 34. i want to give thanks to the lord acts of the apostle 734 i estimated the affliction of my people which is in egypt and i have heard they're groaning and i am and i have come down to deliver them and now come i will send thee into egypt this moses whom they refuse saying who may be a ruler and a judge the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush that's the title um my brother isaac mr pastor and our pastor and i we have placed poser power not strength not force that the people of israel were in slavery but but moses had a godly mother that since the beginning he says she began to speak to moses a delivery would come his mother began to testify to him with her and her husband biendo and the woman conceived and bear a son and when she saw him that he was a godly child she hit him for three months significa extraordinary the word beautiful in greek is alteos which means extraordinary extraordinary moses had an extraordinary birth the bible said it was beautiful but all the children are beautiful when they're born algriego so in the word greek it shows and the sermon israel at the red sea says that moses had a very peculiar birth peculiar because you can see that this that's something extraordinary yes and that's how i want to compare with the birth of moses also his mom gave testimony of how by through god's guidance she placed him in the river this hermann obradon brother branham says he says and the teachings of moses the lord already had had ready ten thousand angels to take care of him watch over him then the mother told him how he he arrived to the daughter of the pharaoh he was hebrew esclavo that when she saw moses he stole her heart all this was working but also mother moses mother had enough faith to place him in the river if she hadn't placed him in the rivers they were killing all the children and brother brandon places in this way that if she wouldn't have given them up or given it to who she gave him she would have he returned to him why because she took care of moses with all of this moses had so much theology today but he tried to deliver the people of israel with his own knowledge but moses wasn't really the truly deliverer in fiesla substances and faith is the substance preaching 47. of course ben was it god or moses who freed the people it was god in moses undone they cried out for the deliverer and when god sent them the deliverer they failed to see it because it was through a man but he was not a man it was god in a man do you believe that moses was the diver because of his wit and intelligence well he said was a slow man to talk he was he was god in moses a gift to the people he was god in christ he said it is not i it is my father who dwells in me moses was born to be a deliverer before the foundation of the earth it was his commission he based it on his own knowledge everything he had in his head everything that his mother and father and witnesses had told them he didn't have the revelation and sometimes that's the way we are we have the bible we have the message but we don't have the revelation we can have scriptures memorized but if we don't have the revelation we have nothing his mother su padre his father or any uterus including the minister no one can give you the revelation le pueden but no through the holy spirit when and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god entos jesus christ and jesus answered and said blessed are thou art simon for flesh and blood had not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven when did moses receive this revelation when he was with the burning bush there is where he received the revelation everything that was told to him he was able to see the purpose that it wasn't to glorify man israel mystery of moses that it was in god but god had called him entonces so we're seeing preaching you're trying to do it with your own strengths you don't have the holy spirit so that that can be able so you can glorify god we all need of the holy spirit to have an experience with god when moses had his experience with god this is straight from a i believe that the youth here have a lot to give apart aside from what you're already doing every time you have a conference with god i believe you can do it even better wow when that was my first experience with the whole my first sprint with the holy spirit and that's amazing in that same church my second experience my second experience was with the laying of hands and they placed the youth they put me with the youth of 16 17 year olds that was my second experience but you have to surrender you have to let go of the eye you have to go to that burning bush we need reverence go with faith but there is something about god that he impels man to do things that are beyond any thought of his own so that it may be to the glory and honor of god and i think that not an honor of my own but i think that it was a privilege to leave everything that was dear to me to get here in the to get here in this desert and suffer as i have never suffered in my life here in this loneliness or the desert but i believe that by doing that and by obeying what god commanded to be done god has opened to us the mysteries of this last day and here we are with this message that for all that we have learned everything has been preached to us but you're never going to be able to finish your purpose the true purpose of god which is to honor him and glory to him then you will be able to have power from god but you have to be able to let go [Music] and i believe thank you and [Applause] god bless you brothers god is good [Music] i would like to get warmed up here it is a privilege to be here tonight i thank my pastor and also god for this opportunity i will be changing my my language here to english uh god bless our brother missael um god can use any one of us amen and can i hear our title for this night power not force all together amen let's let's be here like we want to wait man where did moses receive the revelation and this is where i start my message and it was one of the most momentous days in israel history [Music] when moses called when god called moses from a burning so moses is 80 years old now i'm kind of i'm going to paint you a story now if you just want to work your imagination moses is in the wilderness a burning bush he immediately something unusual noticed something unusual comes close to the bush and god speaks to him think about it meritelo god spoke to moses through the bush and he tells him moses i got a job for you i want you to go back to egypt and now we know he tells the lord his incapabilities how many have been there quantos hey man let's be honest let's participate vamos a participation god says in chapter four verse two of exodus just uh i'm not gonna read it just narrating he says what is in your hand moses he said god told moses throw it down he says and we know what happened right now became a serpent second because the bible says he fled from it and smart people run from snakes trusting for you to understand moses is here because he already tried it by force aura [Music] now moses didn't have biblical instruction about how to turn sticks into snakes no sevilla moses didn't have a biblical instruction to turn sticks into snakes or snakes into the states that's not found anywhere in the textbook so what was god trying to tell moses just as god told moses go preach deliverance mark 16 says uh jesus tells us to go and preach the gospel do we have the gospel or not if you're not sure this night [Music] but when we have the message of the deliverance amen amen it was by baptism of the cloud era la we have the message of deliverance because what god actually said to moses let's just go and preach the message and i'll do whatever needs to be done now this time it wasn't moses doing things it was god doing things god says if i need to turn sticks into snakes hallelujah and when i can relate when my pastor tells me to do something whatever gracias there shouldn't be no doubt no no if god spoke his word that's final is tell your neighbor he five minutes i need to be closing now he finally comes before and he didn't know if pharaoh was going to respond positively to his request that when he showed him that stick trick quick he was going to listen to moses amen here's moses uh trusting that with this trick he's gonna deliver his people and i imagine pharaoh saying after moses telling him to free the people and you think you come and tell and it says it is second timothy 3. now as janice and james will still moses so do these also resist the truth or using the same methods [Applause] brought their rods and their rods became serpents bars did so and the lord commanded and he lifted up the rod and smoked the waters that were in the river in the sight of pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood and the fish that were in the river died and the river stank and the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river and there was blood throughout all the land of egypt and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments and pharaoh's heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as the lord had said i don't have the next verse uh verse 22. and now skipping to the next verse exodus 8-6 and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of egypt in tons and the magicians did so with their enchantments and brought out frogs from the land of egypt then pharaoh called moses and aaron and said and treat the lord that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people and i will let the people go that they may do sacrifice unto the lord entonces now in verse 16 moses is still not stopping and moses and the lord said unto moses saying sarah stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the land that it may become lies throughout all the land of egypt and they did so far and stretched out his hand with the rod and smoked the dust of the earth and it became licensed man and in beast all the dust of the land became lies throughout all the land of egypt and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lies let's read it all together but they [Music] [Applause] you're probably saying brother isaac what are you saying here's what i'm trying to say they may duplicate something they may seem to be ahead of us they can't keep up with the true messenger god bless [Applause] verse now moses kept the flock of jethro his father-in-law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mount of god even to orb is and the angel of the lord appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burned and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses what he said and he said here am i and he said draw now draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where on thou stand is his holy ground he said i am the god of thy father of the god of abra the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face and was afraid to look upon god you may be seated power not force i was reading something someone said once okay how you do something you do everything he cares more about how i do things than the things that i do important he cares how i come to treasury he cares how i preach important uh [Applause] our lives one of the greatest me three million people it's hard to guide on or lead our own home sometimes our own children don't want to follow us guys it must have been an extraordinary man he tried to do it in his first 40 years of life likes to meet old god finds moses hacienda different i mean everything different he was different than when he's now in the wilderness what i used to think i controlled medic i found out is controlling me when i thought of being free that i was being free medic i noticed i was a slave that's where moses found himself understanding what you thought you were controlling was that actually when you changed your mentality who understand that many times we are the ones in bondage what i thought i wasn't worth no lo que pense que no alias what i thought wasn't worth anything what i thought wasn't worth anything was worth more than riches when i thought of not having anything that i had nothing that i had nothing medicuenta this is where moses is found in the place you notice that that place is immensely full of god and that it's a holy place that's where moses was his mentality had changed he didn't see things the way he used to do now god speaks through to him through a bush all right now he's not speaking to him from a big oak tree no let's have lando de pino he's not speaking swim through a great pine tree leaves something very weak and god says through the week i will show you my powers this is what had to change in moses's mind because it wasn't what he was doing that was wrong he was doing it it was in the wrong manner you remember the canaanite woman jesus christ and it comes to the lord jesus [Music] [Applause] but it says when she changed what she was but when the dogs esperanto humble and small place you can think of not moses begins to question god this can't be yo no no my pleasure is moses just obtains prophets i can't go on my own my name i am i what matters is that's right but god had chosen the foolish things [Applause] you [Music] [Applause] [Applause] is and the base things of the world and things which are despised have got chosen and things which are not so bring to not things that are affined that no flesh should glory in his presence i want to tell you this this is the problem that we're a failure it's because we have too much demacia [Music] glory in his presence too much pride to come to the altar so much so much pride you can do so many things who is when moses regress returns to egypt he is different that was greater than anything egypt could offer el polio he could offer them god please now uh it wasn't moses anymore it was i am a revelation of who jesus christ is [Music] i don't want to get very good i just want to ask you who is with you who the decisions or have you done them alone now this man wasn't alone anymore with moses was the great i am and he was the center of everything [Music] h maybe it's in this moment god wants to speak with you just get in control god wants to meet you there you're willing to be put aside lord if you are with me if the great i am is with me then i will be able to stay [Music] god bless [Music] [Music] is [Music] um [Music] yes [Music] is [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] hello [Music]
