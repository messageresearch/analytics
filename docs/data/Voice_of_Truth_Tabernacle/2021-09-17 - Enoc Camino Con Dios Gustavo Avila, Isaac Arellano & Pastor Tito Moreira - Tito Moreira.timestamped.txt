[26:58] tonight
[26:59] [Music]
[27:07] is
[27:09] [Music]
[27:14] [Music]
[28:00] it's a privilege
[28:03] to be here in front of you once again
[28:08] how many feel very privileged to be here
[28:14] because what
[28:22] a lot of youth don't have a friday youth
[28:24] service
[28:28] have a service dedicated to them
[28:32] and here we are
[28:34] on a friday night
[28:37] where we could be home
[28:40] relaxing
[28:42] whatever we
[28:49] [Music]
[28:51] now the thing is you come expecting
[28:53] something
[28:56] it starts off
[28:59] amen amen can we please
[29:02] open up our bibles to first or genesis
[29:06] chapter 5 verse 23.
[29:40] amen amen
[29:43] and it reads like this
[29:47] and then all the days of enoch were
[29:50] 365 years
[29:52] in
[30:00] and enoch walked with god
[30:03] and he was not for god took him
[30:06] coming
[30:12] now if we go to revelations chapter two
[30:15] verse four please
[30:18] apocalypses capitulo dos versicolo
[30:20] cuatro
[30:22] once you have it you can say with an
[30:23] amen
[30:26] amen i want you to follow me
[30:30] amen
[30:31] nevertheless i have somewhat against
[30:34] thee
[30:35] because thou has left
[30:37] my first love
[30:39] perot
[30:44] say one more time with me repetition
[30:48] left
[30:58] amen
[31:00] when our pastor asked us to speak this
[31:02] friday
[31:17] escaminando
[31:18] and like i said god had been working in
[31:21] my heart about this already
[31:26] this friday uh today's service i was
[31:28] going to sing a special este servicio
[31:30] este
[31:44] is take me back to a place
[31:49] where i first received it
[31:54] that's where many of us
[31:56] as young people
[31:58] come
[32:26] he wants
[32:42] hombre uh only now he only needs one
[32:44] scripture
[32:50] but in that scripture so much
[32:53] but inside that scriptures there's so
[32:55] much dent
[32:59] it establishes me to up to today
[33:04] that god can do so much with just a
[33:06] little bit
[33:07] much
[33:21] and the days like our pastor said
[33:25] why he didn't feel good
[33:27] casey didn't want to go
[33:30] but there was something inside of her
[33:34] inside of his bloodline
[33:52] [Music]
[34:09] the creator himself
[34:14] talking ablando conversating conversando
[34:17] and i told myself what type of
[34:19] relationship he knocked out with god
[34:24] the type of relationship that adam once
[34:26] had before classes
[34:29] before the fall
[34:31] and here enoch had it with god yeah what
[34:33] i know
[34:35] and i put myself in pongo
[34:37] i put or i placed this this this scene
[34:44] as like a relationship between a husband
[34:47] and a wife
[34:50] a young man or a young lady
[34:54] i'm not going to be talking about
[34:55] courting
[34:59] but in that sense of area
[35:04] again i i can't preach more than what i
[35:07] live
[35:10] you know and but this is an area where i
[35:12] myself have lived and gone through pero
[35:14] en estado
[35:33] you know that relationship should be
[35:35] with us
[35:39] you know you when you're with that one
[35:41] person
[36:26] that he had with his creator
[36:29] knowing what he did
[36:32] for him
[36:34] knowing what he did
[36:39] wanting to have fellowship
[36:42] even though knowing what his father did
[36:44] or his
[36:44] his father did
[36:46] his great great grandfather did it
[36:50] still god wanted to have fellowship
[36:52] that's amazing
[37:34] you know it comes to a point in our
[37:35] lives as young people
[37:41] if you haven't got in there
[37:44] but
[37:44] some of you will get to the point where
[37:46] you'll be able to start to walk
[38:03] you'll be walking alone
[38:08] if you stay with me i'm trying to get
[38:09] this point where uh
[38:13] you're gonna be alone in making your own
[38:15] decisions
[38:41] we all have that moment in time where we
[38:43] have the options
[38:55] i don't have my parents pushing me
[38:57] anymore
[39:00] you know it's going to come to that
[39:01] point
[39:03] and i asked the question
[39:06] i've asked myself this question
[39:09] where am i at with my relationship with
[39:11] god
[39:20] [Music]
[39:25] where i have
[39:26] that option juan do you think is the
[39:28] option of doing what's right
[39:32] doing what he wants
[39:35] and while i have enough strength
[39:40] to do what he wants me to do
[39:44] to walk where he wants me to walk
[39:48] that's what was going on with enos
[39:52] he was walking not by his own will
[40:21] that you aren't capable of doing
[40:25] god made you capable of many things
[40:30] but he knows what you're not capable of
[40:32] doing
[40:36] but he knows where he can help you
[40:41] to help you to get to be able to be
[40:43] capable
[40:48] to do everything
[40:51] and it's all in him
[40:54] and imagine enoch
[40:56] leaving everything aside
[41:01] such a relationship that he had with god
[41:20] and i return back to that his first love
[41:24] where many times us young people
[41:28] we give our hearts
[41:31] on
[41:32] too
[41:32] fast
[41:34] again i say this for me
[41:37] for me
[41:38] i've given my heart so fast
[41:42] where what i've given my heart to que lo
[41:44] que yo
[41:46] mi corazon or
[42:00] whatever you give your heart to look you
[42:01] suck
[42:04] that in which has it
[42:07] has possession upon you
[42:11] amen we have to get to that place
[42:28] where
[43:08] is
[44:18] [Music]
[44:20] he wants
[44:41] [Music]
[44:46] it's just
[44:48] you have to
[45:02] it's a desperation
[45:14] it's what you have with god that's going
[45:16] to take you back home
[45:37] and it was effortless
[45:39] to step from it was effortless
[45:44] from
[45:57] who doesn't want to be in eternity of
[45:59] love
[46:04] [Music]
[46:06] but i say again
[46:09] you must go back to your first love
[46:27] doste
[46:28] i need more of that jonas
[46:31] i want to have that daily experience the
[46:34] enoch had with god
[46:40] our prophet says in the message the
[46:41] mighty conqueror
[46:48] if you're here without christ tonight
[46:55] if you haven't got a real genuine
[46:58] experience
[47:00] an experience
[47:02] i want to ask you quiero preguntar
[47:05] there's too many church members today
[47:19] if you're not really deeply in love in
[47:23] your heart with christ
[47:31] there's no christ there he says
[47:34] christo
[47:35] could you stand can you take and stand
[47:38] for christ like that mother do it do for
[47:40] her baby
[47:50] it's that kind of
[47:51] it's that kind of a love in your heart
[47:54] that you'd walk right in the face of
[47:56] death
[48:02] or you can hardly testify
[48:12] do you really want christ in your heart
[48:15] like that quiet
[48:33] he's knocking at your heart's door
[48:36] el estato cando la puerta de corazones
[48:39] wants you to receive him just
[48:42] won't you just receive him just now no
[48:45] received
[48:46] implemented
[49:01] yo
[49:08] hey man
[49:10] amen
[49:12] if you could just please stand with me
[49:19] we're going to be praying
[49:21] heavenly father
[49:23] thank you for another opportunity in
[49:25] your house
[49:29] we're here because we need you lord
[49:33] and we know you are here
[49:36] because where there are two or three
[49:38] congregated in your name
[49:42] you said you would be
[50:07] amen lord thank you for
[50:09] being with us one more day
[50:13] and lord please take control
[50:16] and we ask this in the name of lord
[50:18] jesus christ
[50:20] amen amen man you may be seated brothers
[50:25] um
[50:27] uh god is here amen
[50:32] that's right i felt god working in my
[50:33] heart already
[50:38] since today started
[50:40] you know
[50:42] i was uh trying to fix this message
[50:46] and as i was fixing it
[50:49] i was picking scripture like this one
[50:51] yes
[50:55] and it's because uh
[50:57] the scripture is more penetrating than a
[50:59] double-edged sword
[51:03] and um i really don't want to preach
[51:05] this you're
[51:20] here
[51:22] amen
[51:24] quickly i want to give a small report of
[51:26] our trip in las cruces
[51:31] and it was a very humbling experience
[51:40] and we uh shared the subject
[51:45] that he has kept me alive
[51:49] surely the lord has kept all of us alive
[51:54] no we never expected to come this far
[51:59] maybe some some of us don't know yet
[52:03] why we're still alive
[52:05] but like our brother gustavo says
[52:09] we all have a purpose
[52:11] and a reason
[52:14] and first of all i want to give thanks
[52:22] and then i'd like to thank our pastor
[52:26] for keeping this congregation alive
[52:38] hallelujah hallelujah
[52:41] it's just uh it's very humbling it is
[53:21] [Music]
[53:27] quickly followed me to second genesis 5.
[53:33] and we'll be getting into the word now
[53:34] um
[53:37] when you uh verse 24 when you have it
[53:39] can you say amen
[54:08] i brought something short
[54:12] but shirley sharpe
[54:16] you know i was not prepared for it
[54:19] so i need a brave
[54:22] soul
[54:44] all right
[54:45] uh let's let's start with what walking
[54:48] with garden isn't
[54:50] it
[55:03] galatians 5
[55:04] says cinco di
[55:07] this is what walking with god does not
[55:09] mean
[55:11] significant
[55:13] and i promise i was not thinking of
[55:15] anyone
[55:25] it says verse 17 of galatians 5.
[55:31] for the flesh death
[55:41] and these are contrary the one to the
[55:43] other
[55:45] so that you cannot do the things
[55:48] but i cannot guess
[55:50] that you would okay
[55:54] did anybody hear that
[55:57] the flesh goes against our spirits
[56:13] and the spirit thank you
[56:15] in the spirit can we repeat in the
[56:17] spirit
[56:19] with god in the spirit
[56:22] now the works of the flesh
[56:25] are manifest which are these
[56:42] idolatry
[57:24] shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[57:30] and the more i got into this
[57:33] the more we find out how not to walk
[57:35] with god
[57:40] you know i could i could spend
[57:42] years just talking about one of these
[57:47] but what does walking with god mean
[57:52] galatians 5 brother uh
[57:55] giving you the answer straight from your
[57:56] bible
[57:59] verse 16 says
[58:02] this i say then
[58:04] walk in the spirit
[58:07] and you shall not fulfill the lust of
[58:09] the flesh
[58:15] can you imagine enoch walking with his
[58:18] flesh
[58:20] or
[58:34] your
[59:00] and i'll continue reading there in verse
[59:02] 22.
[59:30] there is no law
[59:46] [Applause]
[59:56] have crucified the flesh
[1:00:12] let us not be desirous
[1:00:16] of vain glory
[1:00:19] provoking
[1:00:21] each other
[1:00:24] this is the lord speaking to me brother
[1:00:26] speaking
[1:00:39] neither the things that are in the world
[1:00:43] that's a big one this is for the youth
[1:00:46] since we always want a lot of things in
[1:00:48] this world
[1:00:51] think of the thing you want the most
[1:00:53] from this world
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:01:22] offers
[1:01:50] lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
[1:01:52] the earth
[1:01:55] don't don't think you're going to live
[1:01:57] here brother no
[1:01:59] don't plan to live here
[1:02:03] don't say your foundation here brother
[1:02:29] there's a lot of ways things you lose
[1:02:31] things in this world
[1:02:44] because god is the only eternal one
[1:02:58] i wanted to
[1:03:01] sure something else but i'm i think i'm
[1:03:03] gonna close
[1:03:06] um
[1:03:07] i'd like to uh make parallel
[1:03:13] when mary and joseph
[1:03:16] maria jose
[1:03:18] forgot
[1:03:19] jesus
[1:03:22] jesus and and the feast of the passover
[1:03:35] says in luke 241
[1:03:38] and lucas
[1:03:41] now his parents went to jerusalem every
[1:03:43] year at the feast of passover
[1:03:49] and when he was 12 years old
[1:03:52] they went up to jerusalem after the
[1:03:55] custom of the feasts we don't know
[1:04:11] the child jesus turned behind in
[1:04:13] jerusalem
[1:04:17] and joseph and his mother knew not of it
[1:04:22] [Music]
[1:04:38] and after getting your son
[1:04:41] for almost three days the bible says
[1:04:45] you're not noticing you forgot your son
[1:04:49] i i can't imagine mothers how panicked
[1:04:52] you would be
[1:05:04] to have been in the company
[1:05:34] sitting
[1:05:49] what i want to uh give you
[1:05:53] is that
[1:05:55] sometimes we think that we are walking
[1:05:58] with jesus
[1:06:02] we think we're doing everything right
[1:06:06] you know uh when i was in las cruces
[1:06:10] my brother diego shared with me
[1:06:13] that there was a brother that asked him
[1:06:15] to pray for him because his business was
[1:06:17] not being successful
[1:06:24] and the brother said that
[1:06:27] something happened and a long time ago
[1:06:30] much and he didn't do something with
[1:06:33] that
[1:06:35] so he had to go back and fix
[1:06:39] his mistake
[1:06:41] so that his business would prosper
[1:07:14] and we asked why are we going through
[1:07:16] this
[1:07:18] that's because we left jesus behind
[1:07:23] hermano gustavo
[1:07:24] gustavo comodi armando like brother
[1:07:29] we leave our first love you know we need
[1:07:31] to return to that
[1:07:34] and make amends
[1:07:37] because we like it says here mary and
[1:07:39] joseph returned comedy
[1:08:09] dominok he kept up with god el camino
[1:08:12] con dios so much that he said
[1:08:15] come live with me
[1:08:17] vivek
[1:08:18] i cannot imagine
[1:08:20] god asking me
[1:08:31] and i want to read a quote from the
[1:08:33] brother from brother brandon forgive me
[1:08:38] the message it was not so from the
[1:08:39] beginning
[1:08:43] now if we've lost that joy
[1:08:47] if we lost those things
[1:08:50] and we can't find them among our
[1:08:52] kindreds
[1:08:55] we can't find them nope
[1:08:57] then there's one thing to do
[1:09:00] to go back where we left him at
[1:09:12] and that's exactly what mary and joseph
[1:09:14] did
[1:09:16] they left jesus at the feast and
[1:09:18] pentecost
[1:09:22] now i say this due to our consideration
[1:09:24] and respects
[1:09:28] that's where both catholic and pro
[1:09:31] protestant left jesus yes i
[1:09:39] you can't find him searching around here
[1:09:41] through creeds and denominations
[1:09:54] go back to the beginning
[1:09:56] of principio back to we left where they
[1:09:59] left
[1:10:09] god bless you
[1:10:11] [Applause]
[1:10:20] hey man
[1:10:21] i'm in
[1:10:23] how many can say i can't walk without
[1:10:25] him
[1:10:27] caminar
[1:10:42] we cannot
[1:10:56] he was told
[1:10:58] brother branham
[1:11:00] if you would just preach these things a
[1:11:02] certain way
[1:11:07] we would give you our right hand of
[1:11:08] fellowship
[1:11:12] he said i don't need your right hand of
[1:11:14] fellowship
[1:11:18] i need his hand
[1:11:21] holding my hand
[1:11:24] i wanna i wanna
[1:11:49] it's going to be a challenge to get out
[1:11:50] of here
[1:12:06] and you're like man there's no way out
[1:12:10] well let me tell you without him you're
[1:12:11] not getting out
[1:12:14] it's going to be a challenge to get out
[1:12:16] of here
[1:12:18] but we have the way out
[1:12:34] he gave us the way out of here
[1:12:38] he gave us a way out of here
[1:12:41] enoch came out enough
[1:12:44] he was translated out
[1:12:47] because of the faith the
[1:13:15] it's a rapturing message
[1:13:45] we be walking to aldonde
[1:13:50] where is our direction
[1:13:52] where are you walking towards us
[1:13:55] we gotta be walking back to the word
[1:14:12] the only way to go back home
[1:14:15] is to go back to the words
[1:14:20] that's the only way it is
[1:14:26] it says that enoch
[1:14:29] walked with god
[1:14:34] that means he didn't stay still
[1:14:40] he was not still established
[1:14:43] he didn't get stuck
[1:14:47] that's what many of us don't understand
[1:14:51] our god keeps moving
[1:14:53] so
[1:14:57] the reason why god is putting challenges
[1:14:59] in your life
[1:15:02] so that you keep moving
[1:15:05] the reason why the mother eagles puts
[1:15:08] puts
[1:15:09] challenges in the in the eaglets
[1:15:12] start stirring up the nest
[1:15:18] she starts to stir up the nest
[1:15:22] you know
[1:15:35] and that's why he's making things
[1:15:37] difficult in our lives
[1:15:43] he will never force you
[1:15:47] but he will challenge you
[1:15:50] [Applause]
[1:16:01] get out of your place where you're at
[1:16:02] right now

[1:16:31] says he walked 300
[1:16:40] to get enough transformation power
[1:16:46] so that he would leave this earth
