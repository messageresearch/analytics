burner's down oh i feel better oh so [Music] glory glory oh hallelujah [Music] down [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] foreign [Music] the word of the lord who's expecting something for the lord tonight [Music] amen [Music] my probiotics you are more than enough for me [Music] you're my head [Music] by your stress [Music] shine you are with me [Music] to supply oh [Music] or you are more [Music] you are more than [Music] foreign [Music] you are than enough for me [Music] by [Music] or by [Music] [Music] oh [Music] for you are we [Music] oh it is [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and the lord gave me this romano marcial with our brother marshall we've put a a title called shattering our old nature basando and cautiously will read and isaac was 40 years old when he married rebecca the daughter of bethul the aramian of padan aram hermana de la isaac pray to jehovah for his wife that she was barren and jehovah adopted him and he conceived rebecca his wife look at the interesting part verse 22. and her children fought with henner and she said if so why do i live. and he went to inquire of jehovah and jehovah answered him two nations are in your room and two people will be divided from your vows the one people will be stronger than the other people and the older will serve the younger enclave celestial blessed heavenly father establish so thankful with you foreign [Music] since we're born [Music] [Music] i always complain about everything that old nature that i have can't be changed unless i want it to right nature comes complaining all the time i can put that example and it happens to me personally because pastor doesn't respond to me or they don't put me to preach [Applause] [Music] um doesn't have a maturity but if we take notice there is a maturity in the inner nature this uh matureness has to be floats because it's like different prophet tells us in different messages [Music] and i'm not going to read every single one of them because i was crying [Applause] it says now we fully know we brothers who search the scriptures day and night day and night who read our newspapers and listen to the news commentators this world is now in a group of two great spiritual forces both are religious forces and i believe that these great forces come to maturity like i said one or the others and whoever is i want to feed more the white dog let me confess to you brothers that sometimes it it's hard for me because i like the material things god has for me right and these great forces both were represented into these two sons of isaac a now we see in these two sons that when they before they were even born that they were at war with each other rebecca through her virgin mother well she was a virgin beautiful rebecca who was who made the righteous seeds of god's promise is they were two believers in god consecrated and filled with the holy spirit predestined to the very marriage by which they were united yeah so the prophet asked himself a question how is it possible god had [Music] one a very bad person and the other a very good person and how it was a good person seems to be a bad guy god can never change this program perfecto he makes his program perfect because it's of him yeah he changes his name we get that story we see that jacob stops complaining stops complaining uh complaining in the form of not complaining to god [Music] because in the beginning jacob as we know i don't imagine isaac told him when any young man comes or a young lady comes to me and christ and shouts he says and cries and tears it is a senora it says lord here i am it doesn't matter old nature the prophet says and like i said it's hit me yo i have to leave things in order it's hard for me to leave the uh earthy things hermanos it's hard for me to let go of things the more i have the more no no no i don't have it doesn't matter it doesn't fill me salon right now that one my nature it's maturing little by little the what's inside they say necessitas it says you have to come to a maturity god bless you [Applause] hey man amen [Applause] when i would do good evil as present with me for a delight in the law of god after the inward man amen but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body from the body of this death gracias [Music] cristo nuestro senor nuestro i thank god through jesus christ our lord saw them with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin it's taken a lot for me to get up here but i'm also a man who fears god and i believe his word holiness is is with those characteristics is so william branham is not the same 40 years ago is someone back there tonight william branham was a rank arrested charles and all the habits of the world residian and me laid right in me pero tambiena ventro but also down and i'm a hypocrite [Music] up i acted like a child father and then i turned into oh you is same amen and man brothers listen he says but they're inside of him there was a small particle of life the whole time meditate how many things how many times does he not try to dirty us how many times has he not uh taken advantage of us are you not tired of that tonight just think a little on that youth kid i want you to say to know who you are that this this body is inclined to it tonight [Music] you're gonna know who [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] amen amen and acting preached in 1960 he says now the spiritual man nowadays i'm gonna go back a little bit they say oh as long as i go to church and do what's right what difference does it make ssl that's esau's group el todavia [Music] but jacob loved it where that nature comes from amen brothers we have to discover you know and not be deceived from where that nature comes from if that nature is [Music] [Applause] [Music] and lose ourselves this young don't kill [Music] and upon getting there this governor he decided to leave yes and there was a jailer a guard yeah and he spoke with the young man and he said to him [Music] and the young man [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] can you allow [Music] deliver you tonight [Music] [Applause] [Music] gracias [Music] [Applause] [Music] holy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] god
