you in this moment because we don't have anything and we are not anything without you lord you know this entire day Senora is Lord Jesus Christ we'll be opening our Bibles in Revelation 3 20. and verse 21. we'll be also reading second Samuel chapter 21 verse 7. amen the word of the Lord reads a yes behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and sup with him and he with me verse 21 says metronome foreign to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me and my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne let's read second Samuel chapter 21 verse 7. this is and it reads foreign because the Lord's oath that was between them between David and Jonathan the son of Saul may take your seats brother a Mundo Catholicism I know that Catholicism today celebrate crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ we believe that our Lord Jesus Christ Resurrected because we see that God Brothers this place is I hope that's okay if I share a little what they shared and some time ago Brothers I remember I was at the door seating brothers and we were in The Meditation before starting the service [Music] I'm not sure if it was my ears everyone heard it pero yo yo what I heard songs from Angelic songs because it's always been in my mind we're standing before the Lord Jesus Christ is something tremendous dios and I believe that God ill he no says here's what we sing amen Hermanos dios I believe burden that God this is working on the Samaritan woman saying it was necessary to go through just for one Soul amen all right [Music] and in this moment I tell you that the Lord Jesus Christ I'm not sure how you came this is amen he is and I titled this preaching the king calls for you I'm not sure brother but the Bible says that when David took the throne his friend's name was Jonathan and when he remembered this oath he asked if anyone who is alive and his son no one left alive Nino and the Bible says this child many people said mephibosheth is uh in a place called loader bar is many of us are found in that place many times I found alone amen you know say Lucas not sure what you're seeking on this day he will find him brethren is or I can tell you brother if you came searching for God there it is foreign brethren foreign the Bible says this uh this uh young man was lame he couldn't walk amen he didn't have a way to earned life the son of Saul everything belonged to him that David had this young man the Bible says maybe his clothes maybe his clothes were tornote Hermanos because he didn't have a way after himself foreign amen I I believe maybe because maybe he thought they'd kill him amen amen he wasn't expecting the great surprise they had for him and it says when they bring this young man before David this is fearful before the king it is and it says that King David told him to not fear foreign that I would never forget of the House of Saul amen amen and when he begins to say he was the one that had to be in the throne David was using and he says and he says foreign [Music] it doesn't matter in the lowest place we say I can't continue amen well yes we can brothers because it says even as I also overcame they say you haven't see though it is I also overcame and um sat down with my father in his throne so I believe that we can do it did you really choose God I believe that God he has chosen us let me tell you brother that's the reason the devil amen amen foreign Amen brother let me read this to you this is paragraph 70 they say s hido a construir the one he has gone to build because he said in John chapter 14. it says there are many dwellings I go then they say mismo it's Jesus Christ church amen akike dios we see Brothers wasn't meaning that he was building a lot of houses so we see when he came to this earth amen Easter one of us because everyone The Book of Life is if your name is the sacrifice Jesus did for us at Calvary Hermano Branan Elementary life

the pastor told me two three hours um [Music] from his legs [Music] Luke 12 32 says the Bible says if you're not a little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom amen when God formed us with a purpose amen God didn't only give us life uh just to survive him that's what we need just to survive sometimes we make ourselves as small make ourselves less [Music] we live with a pointless purpose in other words [Music] a purpose that we don't give the sacrifice move us [Music] James 4 3 this is because you ask amiss what purpose are you at to satisfy your own flesh of a purposeless life we want to live how the world lives as we can say a temporary life that's the right intentions God wants to give us our healing maybe but sometimes we don't even ask for them for a better job things foreign thou son of David have mercy upon me and the multitude [Music] have mercy upon me says that Jesus Christ Jesus called him and told him what do you want from me Jesus Jesus stop what do you want from me so return myself [Music] you everything you asked foreign [Music] [Music] we're in the same place yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and the focus from our purpose we believe our vision is Elijah for a double portion is preaching Elijah and Elisha Lisa he says El dijo he said that a double portion of your spirit that's the way don't be scared you have not because

with the flesh the purposes will be added onto Israel Israel was in bondage for many years that they got used to not having Allah I believe they prayed with a smaller with a mentality that was a mind that was limited I believe they got to the point that they pray to be better than to be delivered honey and milk flow sometimes we don't have foreign [Music] sometimes we make God small s we make God so small it's our own vision is small nothing [Music] we don't let God work through us the message faith is our victory now there's so many people that doesn't seem to have any kind of purpose in life especially in this day that we live to think that all they have to do is to keep up with something and with the enticements how can we do that how can God do that when we won't even stand still
