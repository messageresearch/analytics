[0:06] God bless you brothers in this group in the homes we are going to continue talking about
[0:12] the pergamon age of the pergamon church and we will also be talking about the
[0:19] third stage of the perfect man which I am calling discernment we know that we know it
[0:27] by knowledge or science too but I am calling it discernment because I think that
[0:33] is the best way to describe it now talking about discernment we want to take up the topic
[0:39] discernment Looks further, discernment Looks further there are going to be three things that I want
[0:47] you to realize that discernment Looks at. number one discernment Look more of the
[0:55] spiritual things of God discernment looks more to the spiritual things of God
[1:00] number 2 discernment looks more to the danger and The deception of the devil, discernment Looks
[1:12] more to the danger and The deception of the devil and number 3 discernment Looks more and understands more of
[1:21] what is happening in oneself and in others three things which We are going to talk about now and I
[1:30] would like you to simply write them down and lets see how it is that discernment
[1:38] serves us so much and helps us so much in the Pergamon age God Praises the people because although
[1:48] they were in a dangerous place and in a place of so much deception there were people who were overcoming
[1:57] And this is the reason why they were overcoming because they had spiritual discernment now number
[2:03] one discernment Looks more than the spiritual things of God look at what it says here in
[2:11] psalm 139 verse 7 to 8 it says
[2:16] 7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
[2:24] 8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.
[2:31] now it says Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
[2:39] In other words god is speaking through the psalmist David, to us and he is telling us my
[2:49] presence is everywhere there are many people who only look at God in the church there are
[2:56] people who only look at God in the word there is people who only look at God in the message
[3:02] of the hour and all that is fine God is in his word God is in the church God is
[3:09] in the message of the hour but God is in more than all that brothers the first Bible that existed
[3:15] were were the stars and God hid in all his nature he is hidden he
[3:24] is hidden in the simplest things and it takes a spiritual discernment
[3:29] it takes a true spiritual eye to be able to see God in the smallest things
[3:38] if you have spiritual discernment you will be able to look at God everywhere where I will
[3:45] flee from your presence says the psalmist Where will I flee from your spirit wherever I go there
[3:51] you are Oh Brothers How beautiful it is to be able to look at God every day at every moment at every
[4:01] sunrise at every bedtime at every sitting How beautiful it is to be able to say God is
[4:08] always around me and I manage to look at it because we could be blessed by
[4:14] God's blessings constantly and never We never look at it, we never realize it, but discernment
[4:21] helps us to look at more of the spiritual things of God and so we can not only
[4:31] be happy and praise God for what he is doing and why we look at it, but it also
[4:39] helps us to listen to him to receive guidance from God because to receive guidance from
[4:47] God so that he guides us so that he tells us Look son you need to do it this way Look
[4:51] daughter this what you have to do so that he guides you or the guide you need first realize
[5:00] that he is there and that he is talking to you and that he is trying to communicate with you if
[5:08] you never realize that he is there that he is speaking you will never be able to receive
[5:13] guidance from God and correct knowledge to know when something is from God and
[5:20] when something is not from God that is why it is important to look more at the spiritual things of God
[5:28] now number 2 knowledge looks more at danger it looks at it sooner looks at it further away
[5:41] the wise man looks at danger from afar you do not need the danger to be upon
[5:49] you for you to say there is danger there because there is something inside you that tells you that it is not
[5:57] from God that is from the enemy you manage to look at the enemy and what he's trying to do
[6:06] look what it says here again in Revelation chapter 2 verse 13 it says
[6:12] 13 I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
[6:22] in other words you haven't let yourself be deceived by Satan although
[6:27] you are where he dwells where his throne is although you are in such a dangerous time
[6:35] you continue with the right thing because you have been able to look you have been able to look at the enemy you have been able to
[6:44] realize discern when it is the devil who is trying to deceive you he is trying to lead you down
[6:50] the wrong path and you manage to look at him and you identify him and identify his tricks identify his
[6:58] tactics and the bad things he wants to do against you and by looking at him with time and by looking at him or what
[7:05] the devil wants to do you have the opportunity to block him from changing direction
[7:12] in his own territory but you need to have the discernment to know what he is happening
[7:22] how the enemy is trying to deceive you thats number 2 number three the discernment gives you more
[7:33] understanding about what is happening within you and within others look
[7:43] brothers many times we only look superficially when we look at others or even
[7:49] look at ourselves we see that they are angry we see that they are sad we see that
[7:55] maybe they just have things that they can't do or that they make mistakes fall we see
[8:03] someone slip we see ourselves as a failure but behind all that there is more
[8:13] there are more there are people that sometimes you see them angry but they're not angry Simply they are
[8:18] hurt they have been injured sometimes they have complexes sometimes they feel less sometimes the devil
[8:25] is attacking them behind the scenes there is a war what is happening and the
[8:30] devil is attacking them sometimes that we don't understand why we keep falling and falling
[8:36] and falling and it is because within us there is a spiritual war. discernment helps us to
[8:43] understand What is happening within us Look at what
[8:47] Psalm 79 verses 1 to 6 continues to say
[8:51] 139 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.
[8:55] 2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.
[9:01] 3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.
[9:08] 4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.
[9:13] 5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.
[9:18] 6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.
[9:26] the psalmist is saying God You know me completely you know why I get up why I'm sad V
[9:34] I'm going there I'm going here you understand what I don't understand what I don't understand you understand what I don't
[9:42] see you understand you understand why I struggle How can
[9:47] I win How can I get out of where I am You have more knowledge than what I have
[9:55] now That is the knowledge that God wants to give us Because discernment is
[10:01] discernment or knowledge of God that he gives us wants to give For our lives to understand
[10:08] each other better to understand each other better to know that behind the superficial things there are
[10:15] spiritual things happening to us spiritual battles that we are fighting and unless God
[10:22] gives us spiritual discernment we will not know we will not understand and we will not be able help
[10:28] we are not going to be able to go out and help others and say brother Forgive me I am going to say the
[10:35] best and most correct words I am going to help you and not judge you because now I understand what you are going through for
[10:43] that discernment is needed discernment is needed When someone someone Simply
[10:49] is not there having a good day because the devil is attacking them and you go and sometimes you want to knock down the person
[10:55] and attack the person sometimes their husband their wife their children make a mistake and one does not have
[11:01] the discernment of how to talk to them how to help them discernment is needed to be able to still sometimes
[11:08] help others and not attack them not think of the worst of them discernment is needed And
[11:17] that what God wants to give us those are the three things that God wants to give us Now I want to say this
[11:22] so that you understand one thing so that you can discern more notice more be more aware
[11:33] of God and problems and everything else there is one there is a requirement brothers there is something you have
[11:40] to do you have to stop you need not to be in a hurry because when we are in a hurry
[11:47] when we go too fast we do not notice many things things pass us by
[11:55] but when we stop when we go slowly when we stop When we meditate then God
[12:04] starts to show us things that we weren't looking at before God starts to show us things that we
[12:13] didn't notice before Then it's so important its important to stop to stop to go slowly to listen
[12:24] to God to notice to realize what God is doing brothers and we are sometimes
[12:32] in a world of running 100 miles per hour and we do not stop but it is time brothers to stop
[12:40] and we want spiritual discernment we need to stop stop say lord what are you trying
[12:49] to tell me maybe you want to warn me of a danger maybe you want me to be of better help to
[12:54] someone maybe you want me to call someone maybe you want to direct me one way or another
[12:59] you have to stop stop yourself brother of running arrive at the service on time stay still
[13:07] and with this I recommend everyone please in your home services keep the atmosphere
[13:16] still keep keep the children still go with a mentality of being calm
[13:24] to arrive on time of not being distracted by eating things no be focused and giving
[13:31] time to the Holy Spirit time to show you more give you more discernment its very important so
[13:39] brothers I hope you have learned those three things talk about those three things number one
[13:46] discernment Looks more of the spiritual things of God number 2 discernment Looks at the danger
[13:51] and the enemy and number 3 discernment Looks more into yourself into others to
[13:59] understand them better God bless you we love you and we'll see each other next time
[14:04] 1. What things does discernment see? 2. In what circumstances do we need more discernment? 3. How can we discern more?
