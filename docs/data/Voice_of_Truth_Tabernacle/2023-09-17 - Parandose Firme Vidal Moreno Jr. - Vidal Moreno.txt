[Music] for them [Music] God bless everyone it was when negatollos it's good to be in the house of the Lord you know we come to see Jesus amen you know one of the things I've learned and I've read this I read this one time and I'll never forget it and uh so they say that when uh you know a lot of people criticize Judas because he delivered Jesus but that's what the people wanted that's what they wanted they wanted Jesus Jesus you know and I think that's what the people want New York is he took him to the real Jesus Jesus he didn't give him a substitute you know and if the preachers you know and and you know and the Christians could just give people the real Jesus you know the world would be a better place you know because that's what the people come to see you know we don't come to see you know people want Jesus Jesus and you know we want him to to be uh to be here and you know if you expected him to be here then he's here Anton says he's here for everything you need God bless everyone the people that visit us brothers and throughout the world let's open our Bibles uh to the book of Ephesians chapter sixes verse 13 verse we're talking about uh in our subject is Conquering yourself you know and uh for a title decided to title it uh taking a stand amen amen uh Ephesians 6 13 reads like this says wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all heavenly father father Celestia we're so grateful Lord this morning to be able to be in your presence it just brings a peace and a joy to my heart you know and and you know I believe that that's what the people want your crocus is they want to find that peace that surpasses all understands we ask that you speak to us Lord speak to our hearts we just leave here Lord rejoicing because we heard from you we put the service in your hands Manos you just see the needs of your children you just bless them Lord in an abundant way father we uh we glorify your name our Lord Jesus Christ uh you know when uh we uh talk about when we read the scripture you know it's uh it's one of those uh scriptures you know that's talking about you know uh you know in that chapter it talks about putting on the harm or a God and El context you know that you may be able to stand you know to withstand in the evil day you know uh I don't believe that Paul was just talking about his day I don't believe this Apollo just uh just talking about his day you know because I believe that we're standing in an evil day amen amen you know uh when you look at the war that is uh happening and uh and you know uh I don't believe that Ukraine you know woke up you know thinking one day that they were gonna have to uh go to war you know I don't believe that they were expecting that I believe that you know uh that uh Russia wanted you know uh was uh they just uh I mean they they obviously wanted to take over control but you know uh we all just you know maybe Ukraine was like well it's just rumors they're just rumors uh you know but they woke up one day you know and they were being invaded foreign when it comes to your home turf su casa you know that's that's when uh that that's when you you know what you're made of yes you know there were some people that decided to run there was some people that just that just took the first plane ticket out of Ukraine you know and then there was others that uh that that decided to stay okay they may not have known how to fight but they were going to learn amen amen and you know I think that we have to make it personal this morning you know because uh we've been invaded amen amen uh you know when uh when Russia went into Ukraine oh you know they went they only went so far because there was Warriors there there were soldiers you know they decided to take a stand you know they they weren't going to lose any more grounds but they had to stand up they had to stand firm you know and and uh you know one of the strategies that Russia has used is that the the uh what they took over you know they they put our minds landmines you know and I thought about that you know because when uh you are that's one of the award strategies now you know because when you uh step on a mine you know uh once you get off of it then you just it just blows up explota so you blow up you know so there's a lot of people you know that they're fighting this war you know and and they it could be their last day you see when you talk about walking in the fear of God I believe those soldiers are walking in that fear amen amen you know because it could be their last step and you know I believe that the devil Diablo you know he's invaded all right he's invaded our territory he's invaded our minds he's invaded our homes he's invaded our schools there's not a whole lot of things that he hasn't invaded But there Comes A Time in your life where you just you know you just find out you know that What You're Made Of you find out that you know you just can't take it anymore you know you could be like a lot of other people except foreign [Music] man amen you know in the Book of Revelations uh the Bible you know the first one on that list you know in the Lake of Fire is cowards [Music] they have everything amen and you know one thing that that it's always that always wanted to be I remember telling my mom one day I wanna I wanna be a soldier I didn't know what to do when I got out of high school like a lot of the youth you know I said you know and I wanted to go be a marine you know the Marine he he uh he's it's the only Branch you know that that knows how to fight on all three uh in all three terrains all three he knows how to fight on water landing area and I believe that the Lord Jesus has trained his soldiers to fight on all three the main reason I wanted to be a soldier is first because I didn't know what I wanted to do but second of all is because I liked obstacle courses and you know that's probably not a good reason because going to war is in the game that was but I really enjoyed it but um I was like I could be good at obstacle courses but not really realizing that that was an obstacle course that I might not come back from you know and I think that that's how uh you know many times when we decide to fight foreign it's like it's like a game to you foreign we see the struggle of of these two young men inside of of the the womb of their mother Genesis 25 22 says this is in the children's struggle together within her and she said if it be so why am I thus yes and she went to inquire of the Lord and the Lord said unto her he says two nations are in thy womb those naciones two men are people shall be separated from thy bows and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the Elder Shall Serve the young girls amen amen who was this woman can anybody answer that who was the woman that they were speaking of here see it was Rebecca amen amen you know so there was this war inside of her you know that that Jenny was almost unbearable support it almost seemed like she'd rather die than fighting the war but because the struggle wins inside I want to tell you something Brothers you know a lot of times you know we're struggling you know and and we don't know why you know we think it's the brother at church we think it's your co-workers everybody else you blame the wife that God gave you blame everybody else but you'll never look at yourself you don't realize that the struggle is not out there amen I I that's what I believe you know I believe that with all of my heart you know uh the struggle's real la lucha is real too God is more real than your struggling he is more reality amen amen but you know when uh we uh we decide that we want to fight oh you know it just uh it's one of those things that we really have to consider amen uh you know because uh we have we can take a stand you know I I I but you know what what are you standing foreign why does he die why does he um why does he go to war but you know he's not the one that declared it he's not the one that declared Wars you see War Began because you know the devil I was the one that declared it he said I could be more than you I could be greater than you and so he decided you know to to go to war but you know Jesus you know I believe that in the very beginning you know that there was a bit there were some people back there foreign [Music] so [Music] we made the choice at times we just you know we we have to hear the word to know that so you got to take a stand man you see but when you take that stance oh you know there are certain things oh you know what they need to be thought about you know in order to begin to fight you know because we can be in church yeah I want to read I want to read Corinthia Philippians excuse me uh chapter 4 verse one Philippians 4 verse 1. and it says this it says therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and Crown it says so Stand Fast in the Lord my dearly beloved asike Hermanos uh you know I I like what he said so Stand Fast in the Lord you know I I in the Lord because you know you can be in church and not be in the Lord amen amen you see it when you when you're in church you know that's a good place to be but that doesn't mean you're in the right place there's been a lot of people that have been in church that doesn't mean they've been in the Lord you're not in the Lord then you're really out of position you're out of place foreign you know like we don't we don't realize is that we may not like it it may not be comfortable you may not you know you may you may not it's not enjoyable but you know that's where God that's where God gives his children you know the greatest Revelations amen amen I believe that I believe that God he wants to give you a revelation where you are where you're standing of what you should be doing he wants to give you purpose he wants to give you Joy he wants to give you peace you have to give him the right away but you have to let him guys yeah but when we do it but when we when we say we want to do it the first thing that happens is that you begin to complain yes you know you wanted your life changed you wanted to be transformed oh you wanted God to do great things in your life oh well you're gonna have to you're gonna have to work foreign as my dad it wasn't so much that people couldn't say it that bothered me although it did but I think what upset me more than anything uh was that I wasn't like him okay and I didn't want to be like him you know I I I I hated the fact that that I had carried his name and uh and I was not like him at all you know and uh you know I think there's a lot of people here young men young ladies even adults Cristiano and you may have grown up in church and you don't fully understand what's happening why couldn't I been just like everybody else well you know you clench your teeth foreign because you got the uniform part down foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign foreign territorial you see that's not taking a stand because when you take a stand are you stand firm but you hold your position and when the general says amen amen it kind of going back to the story of my father you know he was uh he was pretty rough rudo and uh you know I resented him for a long time you know many years went by you know I was just a just a little guy on muchachito and uh there was uh I was telling the brothers in the small groups as well [Music] you know when I when I would fall you know as a young man you know playing around and whatnot and meaning I scraped myself up and uh you know just like any any of five six seven-year-olds for whatever you know first thing you do is you cry okay but you know my dad he would look at me and he'd be like son if you don't get up and I get there to pick you up it's gonna go a lot worse and I found out that he wasn't lying okay and uh you know I resented him a lot for that one thing I learned how to do was I used to I used to clench my teeth and I would hide my pain yes and you know I would walk away before my dad could get to me and uh I would go find a place to cry because it hurts you know it hurt because I didn't understand and you know he used to tell me you used to tell me this all the time he'd be like son he's like you may not understand what's going on right now but when you grow up he's like you're gonna find out what this was all about you know I just wanted some comfort you know and I I didn't understand yeah I you know I I remember when my daughter was riding her bike and uh those words came out of my mouth kind of yes and she fell and she was barely starting to learn he said and uh you know she started wanting to cry I was like I was like because it's gonna hurt more if you stay down my dog my wife was like she's just a little girl I was like yeah that's right you know it it was just kind of one of those things that was that was instinct to me foreign you you just you just gotta get up man because in all reality staying down you're staying downward somebody can just kick you around the devil can just do whatever he wants with you he'll do whatever he wants to as long as you're on the ground because he knows that there's not a fight there there's not a fight there if you're just on the ground although although you know it hurts but you gotta get back up you can't just stay there you can't just stay on the ground and you get to the point where's you either run back or you stand up and fights take it foreign foreign exactly you know one of the things uh I'm posing now yes one of the things that I've I've learned throughout my life in this walk in this in this war you know uh it's it's real you know uh I just uh I think a lot of us you know May may be able to identify you know with with the story Historia with my story you know a lot of us here are wounded a lot of us maybe what your dad did maybe what your mom did so what your brother or sister did you know if you're like that is you know there's a war going on inside and uh you haven't learned how to deal with that yet you don't fully understand why it had to be that way uh you know what when I think about those things you know I've learned through my life you know that there's people okay personas there are people that that are gonna do more than others perhaps you know how uh I'll put our pastor in this example you know he does so much mucho but God made him that way you know and he's taking a good attitude towards it is you know and he stood firm on his colleague but he's not the only one that has a calling we all have a call what are you gonna do you know what where's you gonna go are you gonna are you gonna Retreat you know after you promised God that you would live for him that you would be the one to go into the fight that you would go into the fire okay no for your brother or for your sisters like you would be the one who said no you promisedo it was you nobody else promised it I remember when I promisedi that I would stand for him and I did it behind the pulpit oh because I was tired because I was tired of living the way I was living I was tired of of just of just trying to guess my way through life you know just just guessing maybe this is what I should do maybe this is what I should do that and it was constantly wrong I would just it would just blow up take a step just blow up yes be hurt it got so bad I couldn't even say the right thing couldn't tell my wife the right things couldn't tell my kids the right thing could you tell my mom the right thing solo I found myself a wounded and then you know looking back you know what some of the things my dad did Papa they weren't all bad because like every time I fell there was something inside me that wouldn't let me stay down that I just had to get up because I knew I knew that if I stayed down it was gonna be worse man and that's what he was trying to teach me as local there was going to be times where he wasn't going to be there but you know what if my dad could see me today I would tell him thank you you know my dad still lives you know if he ever sees this I want to say thank you because every time you told me to get up every time it hurts every time I went to cry by myself [Music] he was teaching me he was teaching me the way of a soldier yeah it's not gonna be easy it's not gonna be easy [Music] I'm still fighting and you know I've lost some battles and I want some too but you know I'm not ready to give up I'm ready to continue I'm ready to keep going because I haven't seen the top yet okay I've not seen the top yet you can reach the highest mountain and you haven't seen what God can do they can do so much so I tell you this morning but you may be hurting you may be wounded and either or you may be in a terrible condition but I tell you one thing you can't stay there it's gonna be painful father but you can't stay there foreign [Music] foreign they come back with the good news and they said it is sin we're more than able to take this land oh man they liked what they saw hey oh man they had them big grapes because they come back with the evidence oh man they were excited you know the rest of them oh the rest of them said we can't take it they're too big they're too great he silenced the people he says silence you tell the devil silence you don't know what you're talking about symbol and the people El Pueblo for a momento I believe that most I mean all of them believed it the majority but I believe that calebok Caleb look to Joshua Josue he said Joshua Josue I'm not going back now going back to Egypt I'm not I'm not going back because Caleb knew okay you know what it was like to be a slave he knew what it was like to get beat down he knew what it was like I don't know if you can relate Joshua I'm not going back I'm not going back Joshua he started the fire I saw something you could never imagine oh it's a revelation that you could never imagine and I'm going back I'm going back together born and he stood yes [Music] for 40 years with the same testimony until those youths those little boys may be at the time grew up and they learn how to fight and one day Joshua woke up and led by the Holy Ghost are you ready I've been waiting for this day it is [Music] it's time to fight the Giants Now We're
