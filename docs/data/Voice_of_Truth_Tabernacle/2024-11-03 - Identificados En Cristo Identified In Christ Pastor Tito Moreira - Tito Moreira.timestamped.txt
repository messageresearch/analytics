[21:42] Genesis Chapter
[21:45] 2 Verse
[21:49] 18 we welcome every one of
[21:53] you hoping you feel good in the house of
[21:55] the Lord
[22:00] Hing you came with a desire to receive
[22:02] from
[22:03] God I need him this morning I need more
[22:07] of God I want more of
[22:12] God I yearn for him with all my heart
[22:17] amen Genesis 2:18
[22:26] says and the Lord God said it is not
[22:28] good that the man should be alone I will
[22:30] make him a help me for
[22:44] him verse 23 and Adam said this is now
[22:47] bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh
[22:48] she shall be called woman because she
[22:50] was taken out of
[22:56] man therefore shall a man leave his
[22:58] father and his mother and shall cleave
[23:00] unto his wife and they shall be one
[23:02] flesh one more
[23:04] scripture
[23:07] Ephesians chapter
[23:09] 5 verse
[23:12] 25 Ephesians
[23:18] 52 been speaking of a love relationship
[23:21] with
[23:23] God making our relationship deeper with
[23:26] God
[23:29] everything we
[23:30] have in the spiritual
[23:34] environment depends on our relationship
[23:36] with
[23:38] God all the fruit we will
[23:42] produce is depending on our
[23:45] relationship if we're not connected to
[23:49] him in a
[23:52] relationship we cannot produce the
[23:54] fruit that we should be as Christians
[24:00] Ephesians
[24:06] 52 husbands love your wives even as
[24:09] Christ also loved the church and gave
[24:10] himself for
[24:17] it that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[24:20] with the washing of the Water by the
[24:21] word
[24:31] that he might presented to himself a
[24:33] glorious church not having spa or
[24:35] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[24:37] should be holy and without
[24:39] blemish I'll read verse
[24:45] 30 for we are members of his body of his
[24:47] flesh and his
[24:54] bones for this cause shall a man leave
[24:56] his father and mother and shall be
[24:57] joined unto his wife and they tooo shall
[24:59] be one
[25:06] flesh this is a great mystery but I
[25:08] speak concerning Christ and the church
[25:11] let us pray Heavenly
[25:14] Father put ourselves in your hands One
[25:16] More Time Lord as a
[25:19] church as members Lord of one
[25:23] body as a member joined together come to
[25:28] worship you and put our focus on we come
[25:32] for you to speak us we want to open our
[25:35] hearts
[25:37] Lord we want you to speak to our
[25:41] souls Lord Jesus Christ move freely
[25:45] among don't allow an evil
[25:48] thought nothing
[25:52] that's connection with you Lord Jesus
[25:55] Christ we want to hear you
[25:59] we come to worship you we come to give
[26:01] you
[26:04] honor we come to be in a love affair
[26:06] with
[26:07] you don't allow us to
[26:12] leave without spending this time
[26:14] together with
[26:16] you we ask that your
[26:19] presence Lord be connected with
[26:24] ours and may we receive what our soul is
[26:29] in the precious name of the Lord Jesus
[26:31] Christ
[26:32] amen may all have your
[26:40] seats we've been speaking of a love
[26:49] relationship because we want a love
[26:51] relationship with our Lord Jesus
[26:56] Christ not only do we want a
[26:58] relationship with him as a
[27:00] savior that's fine to be
[27:02] saved it's fine to come to
[27:06] church accept the Lord Jesus Christ as
[27:08] our
[27:10] savior but there's a group of
[27:14] people chosen for something higher than
[27:20] that chosen not only to be a member of a
[27:24] church or only to be saved
[27:32] there was a group of people that were
[27:33] chosen to be the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[27:43] Christ they will not have a simple
[27:45] relationship of saved and
[27:49] [Applause]
[27:51] savior but they will dive into a deeper
[27:53] relationship
[27:56] with he will not only only be their
[27:59] savior not only their
[28:02] redeemer but he will be their
[28:06] lord he will be their
[28:09] love he will be their everything I want
[28:13] to tell
[28:14] [Applause]
[28:15] you that's the type of relationship I
[28:17] want with my
[28:19] Lord not only do I want to be
[28:24] saved not only do I want to know that he
[28:26] loves me
[28:29] I that I've loved him with all my
[28:33] heart I want to know that the love is
[28:38] reciprocal not only do I want to be the
[28:42] one I want to be part of his
[28:45] bride I want to be in a special
[28:48] fellowship with
[28:51] him that's something only the bride will
[28:54] have
[28:58] and I believe we're speaking to the
[29:00] Bride of the Lord Jesus
[29:02] [Applause]
[29:04] Christ so we want to get into that
[29:06] affair with
[29:07] him that relationship with
[29:12] him we've been studying what happened
[29:14] with Adam and
[29:17] Eve and comparing it to our relationship
[29:20] with the Lord Jesus
[29:23] Christ when God made man
[29:28] he didn't bring the woman with
[29:32] him the spirit of the woman was inside
[29:37] Adam but Adam was without a
[29:42] helpmate now that's a type of
[29:48] God when God was there before cre the
[29:53] universe let's say when he was alone
[29:58] he was
[30:01] Elohim he didn't have anything to
[30:03] worship
[30:05] him he didn't have anybody to speak
[30:10] with it was simply
[30:14] Elohim even we say our brother Bram told
[30:19] us that's when God was not God
[30:23] yet because he didn't have anything or
[30:26] anyone to worship
[30:30] and the word god means a object of
[30:34] worship and when nobody could
[30:38] worship because there was no creation to
[30:40] worship
[30:42] him he was found
[30:45] alone so he began to make
[30:48] angels and the
[30:52] angels God made them a government in
[30:55] heaven
[30:58] he put angels for certain
[31:00] offices and then he said
[31:02] archangels and then he put cherubim
[31:07] [Applause]
[31:08] Sims all type of heavenly
[31:12] beings and they began to give God
[31:15] worship they begin to give him glory and
[31:23] worship but this was not enough for God
[31:26] still
[31:28] when God created the
[31:30] angels He created a
[31:33] being that he could be
[31:38] ruling that up to a certain point he
[31:41] could
[31:42] order that was a
[31:46] type of the animals God placed on
[31:50] Earth God put these
[31:53] animals to serve
[31:56] man he put the
[31:58] lion he put the
[32:01] rooster he put the
[32:04] hen he even put the serpent the being
[32:09] Serpent and the woman being
[32:14] Serpent and those were all under the
[32:16] ruling or government of
[32:20] Adam because Adam was
[32:25] ordained or commanded to rule over the
[32:28] beasts of the
[32:31] earth and over the fouls of the
[32:34] earth and everything was to serve
[32:40] Adam so it was similar when God created
[32:42] the
[32:43] angels and we find
[32:46] out that that was still not
[32:49] enough the scripture
[32:51] says God saw
[32:55] Adam and God said it is not not good for
[32:58] man to be
[32:59] alone in other
[33:02] words he needs a helpmate for
[33:07] him the rooster was not
[33:11] enough the gorilla was not
[33:15] enough Adam wanted to have fellowship
[33:17] with
[33:18] them but he found
[33:22] out he couldn't have that fellowship
[33:25] with
[33:26] them and in the the same manner
[33:29] God when he made the
[33:32] Angels yes they did worship they did
[33:35] serve
[33:37] him but he could not have fellowship
[33:42] with he wanted
[33:46] Fellowship
[33:49] Adam maybe spoke with the
[33:52] gorilla I
[33:55] imagine he would tell him about his
[34:00] day and the gorilla just kept eating his
[34:05] plants and saw him a little
[34:11] strange and Adam maybe
[34:13] said
[34:16] well will there'll be somebody to
[34:19] understand
[34:21] me will there'll be someone
[34:23] comprehending what I'm
[34:26] speaking maybe he spoke with the
[34:30] serpent because the serpent could
[34:33] talk but when he spoke to
[34:38] it that he had a desire to worship His
[34:42] God when he spoke to him of his
[34:45] emotions of when he spoke what was in
[34:47] his
[34:50] soul the serpent could not
[34:53] answer because the serpent was soulless
[34:57] the rooster was
[34:59] soulless the dog was without a soul the
[35:03] lion as strong as
[35:07] he did not have the soul that was inside
[35:10] Adam brother brandom
[35:13] says that's why the human being is
[35:16] different in the animal
[35:19] kingdom because the human being has a
[35:23] soul that's why he dresses different
[35:27] that's why he tries doing things
[35:30] different he has a higher
[35:34] imagination because the soul God put in
[35:37] him makes him
[35:39] different so
[35:42] Adam could not
[35:44] identify with with the
[35:47] hen or the
[35:50] gorilla maybe they were Ser things even
[35:53] with a
[35:55] serpent but something was
[36:00] SE something that didn't allow them to
[36:04] Fellowship they understand each other
[36:11] completely then God
[36:14] said he needs
[36:17] someone to be like
[36:22] him he needs a
[36:25] helpmate he needs someone
[36:28] to be similar to
[36:30] him to have the same
[36:32] feeling the same
[36:35] emotions the same
[36:37] thoughts then God
[36:40] says I will give him a
[36:44] helpmate someone for him to speak
[36:48] with someone that can feel what he's
[36:51] feeling come on
[36:53] church that's what God wants that's what
[36:56] God desires
[36:58] wants a
[36:59] bride a
[37:01] church that feels what he's
[37:07] feeling cannot fill that
[37:10] [Applause]
[37:15] void for the longest
[37:19] time denominations and
[37:22] churches have made us think
[37:28] that we aren't like he
[37:33] is there's a song of Jes Romero I'm sure
[37:36] you've heard
[37:38] it that says he's not like
[37:42] me he's not like
[37:45] me although he has become a man he's not
[37:49] like
[37:52] me thanks to God for a message
[37:59] that began to call a
[38:01] bride and began to tell
[38:04] us that
[38:06] we were made to be like
[38:10] him we were not made to be like the
[38:16] gorilla to be like the
[38:18] serpent when God made man
[38:23] he let make man
[38:28] likeness why brother Bram
[38:32] says God wanted
[38:35] [Applause]
[38:37] Fellowship God wants
[38:40] Fellowship the only
[38:44] way to really have
[38:48] Fellowship you must be like the other
[38:53] person how would I
[38:55] look telling
[38:58] or saying brother
[39:01] Isaac do you know how it
[39:04] feels when your heart is
[39:07] broken and brother
[39:10] Isaac let's say he was a serpent or not
[39:14] a serpent all
[39:15] right but he would
[39:18] say I've never felt
[39:21] that I've never gone through
[39:25] that what type of fellow ship can be
[39:28] between
[39:30] us that's why an angel cannot
[39:34] understand understand
[39:37] God because he was not made to God's
[39:40] image but when God decided to
[39:44] make when God
[39:46] decided to have
[39:49] Fellowship not just be
[39:51] worshiped not only did he want to be
[39:54] worship he wanted Fellowship
[39:58] somebody to
[40:00] understand to
[40:03] understand see him what he truly
[40:08] is he had to make a
[40:11] being that was flesh of his bones of his
[40:16] bones Spirit of his
[40:24] spirit and when he made man
[40:29] he made someone like
[40:33] him he made someone like
[40:36] him
[40:40] church I want to tell
[40:43] you the dev has wanted to lie to us for
[40:46] so
[40:48] long tried to tell us that we aren't
[40:50] like
[40:51] him but we're here to tell
[40:54] you if you are part of the Bride you
[40:57] were
[40:58] made from him of him for him to be like
[41:05] him hallelujah
[41:08] hallelujah we must begin to see
[41:12] ourselves like what he's made us he did
[41:16] not make us to
[41:18] Simply Be
[41:20] robots that come and worship a God he
[41:23] made us to have communion with him
[41:29] understand him to speak with
[41:32] him make love with
[41:35] [Applause]
[41:40] him oh hallelujah
[41:44] hallelujah he wanted to speak with
[41:48] someone he wanted to feel with
[41:52] someone he wanted to accomplish
[41:54] something with someone
[41:59] he didn't only want a lot of
[42:01] worship because let me tell
[42:05] you you can get many compliments from
[42:10] people but if it's not from the person
[42:13] you want
[42:14] them they're not worth the
[42:17] same come on Church yes or
[42:22] yes someone else can tell you look very
[42:24] well
[42:27] but if it's not from the
[42:29] person that you want to hear it
[42:31] from it's not worth the
[42:34] same and it's the same with
[42:38] God the angels can say
[42:41] holy the angels can say I love you
[42:45] God angels can have all type of
[42:48] worship but no
[42:50] one to it like his bride
[42:54] [Applause]
[42:58] no one can do it like his
[43:01] bride no one makes God
[43:03] feel so
[43:06] worship of the Lord Jesus
[43:10] [Applause]
[43:19] Christ you notice why the dev wants to
[43:21] take away your
[43:24] worship we come to church
[43:27] and fail and
[43:30] sin oh we're
[43:32] angry we're
[43:35] sad or we have a temper with something
[43:37] in
[43:39] church and we don't want to worship God
[43:44] anymore first of all what did God do to
[43:47] you come on
[43:50] Church did God do to you to be sad quiet
[43:57] God do to
[43:58] you or did you come to worship the
[44:00] church did you come to worship
[44:03] the are you here
[44:05] to who did you come for
[44:18] today God wants us to
[44:22] know he is searching
[44:27] for this love relationship with
[44:31] us the message god making his
[44:36] promise the prophet speaks about the
[44:40] Dove and Compares it with God's
[44:47] love he says now the dove is the meekest
[44:50] of all the birds that fly in
[44:52] heaven there's nothing like the dove
[44:55] then he says
[44:59] the dove is a
[45:01] lover repeat the dove is a
[45:05] lover the dove CS in the
[45:09] evening how I have listened to that old
[45:12] Dove many
[45:16] times there's nothing there's nothing
[45:19] more beautiful than to hear the dove in
[45:21] the evening coin the turtle
[45:24] dove I remember when I lost my wife
[45:29] when I was just a young Baptist
[45:31] preacher I went out to the grave
[45:36] everying and I'd sit at I'd sit out
[45:39] there as the sun went
[45:43] [Applause]
[45:47] down and seemed like this big old Dove
[45:50] must have knew that I was sad
[46:01] he would come there and sit up in the
[46:03] bush and as the sun was setting and the
[46:05] wind blowing though through the trees he
[46:07] would coup to
[46:09] me nothing more
[46:13] consoling to hear a dove in the
[46:18] evening coing its sweet message it's a
[46:23] lover then he says God is a lover God is
[46:30] love God so of the World when they were
[46:34] unlovable that he gave his
[46:36] son to make them lovable and God here it
[46:40] is God wants to come
[46:43] down and make love to
[46:45] you he's
[46:47] seeking thirsting
[46:50] [Applause]
[46:54] hungering trying to get
[46:57] trying to get to some of your starchy
[46:59] Hearts to make love to
[47:01] you as a love affair not a law but a
[47:06] love it's all in
[47:09] love God so
[47:13] loved that what surprises me the most
[47:16] that's how the prophet says it God is
[47:19] hungering thir
[47:22] thing then you notice
[47:26] how we
[47:29] think that God doesn't need
[47:33] anything how
[47:36] we that he doesn't need anything from
[47:39] us I think that's why many times we
[47:42] reserve
[47:43] ourselves we think he doesn't want
[47:45] it we think he doesn't need
[47:48] it but the prophet tells us he's
[47:52] thirsting
[47:54] God condescended
[47:57] from a form of
[48:01] Elohim condescended to a pillar of fire
[48:05] to the
[48:07] Loos and in that
[48:09] form he could be
[48:12] worshiped he wanted to be
[48:15] worship and every time he was
[48:18] condescending he needed even more
[48:22] [Applause]
[48:27] he made
[48:28] himself in a
[48:32] form where he would need
[48:35] something that blows my
[48:39] mind but Adam is a type of the Lord
[48:41] Jesus
[48:44] Christ and God said it's not good for
[48:46] man to be
[48:47] alone he wanted to speak with he wanted
[48:50] to talk
[48:52] with he didn't need somebody physically
[48:56] speaking physically I'm speaking in your
[49:01] soul someone to understand
[49:04] [Applause]
[49:09] him and God condescended to a
[49:13] point where he could be
[49:17] hungry of or hungry for
[49:21] love
[49:23] thirsting for your loveen
[49:30] not sure if you're listening
[49:32] Church how many believe the prophet of
[49:36] God God is thirsting
[49:40] hungering it would be no
[49:43] good to give God
[49:45] love if he didn't need
[49:54] it sure you understand
[49:58] this makes you think different about
[50:01] God but if he can make himself a
[50:05] man have to eat drink and everything
[50:09] else he can get down to a
[50:12] level where he desires your
[50:17] Worship in one occasion Jesus tells a
[50:19] Samaritan
[50:21] woman I'll read it in joh chapter 4
[50:27] verse 21 and
[50:33] on Jesus said unto her woman believe me
[50:36] the hour cometh when ye shall neither in
[50:38] this mountain nor yeah at Jerusalem
[50:40] worship the
[50:45] father ye worship ye know not what ye
[50:49] know what we worship for salvation is of
[50:52] the
[50:52] Jews but the hour cometh and now is
[50:57] when the true
[51:00] worshippers shall worship the father in
[51:02] spirit and in
[51:07] truth for the father seeketh such to
[51:09] worship
[51:11] him this is incredible
[51:14] now God is searching for
[51:17] worshippers God is searching for
[51:21] someone that can
[51:23] demonstrate come on I don't know if you
[51:25] understand Church
[51:28] of our
[51:29] love just like
[51:32] ad was searching for
[51:35] Fellowship God wants our
[51:39] [Music]
[51:42] fellowship brother Bram
[51:46] says about that
[51:48] Dove God is love he
[51:52] says God is a lover
[52:01] God wants to come down and make love to
[52:02] you he's seeking thirsting
[52:04] hungering
[52:06] Brethren if a dove if a
[52:10] dove can
[52:13] feel says
[52:15] that could feel his
[52:18] sadness his sorrow and would
[52:22] cool began to cool the prophet oh I
[52:25] believe that
[52:28] if God sent Crow to feed Ravens to feed
[52:32] elah God sent Ravens
[52:35] to why not send a
[52:38] dove to co his
[52:40] servant when he was
[52:42] going through the toughest time in his
[52:46] life but if a
[52:48] dve can
[52:50] feel when the human being has
[52:54] pain I believe that the
[52:57] Lord Jesus Christ can
[53:00] feel when his
[53:03] beloved when her beloved is asking for
[53:07] [Applause]
[53:10] something behold I stand at the door and
[53:13] knock behold I am
[53:16] here another quote later
[53:20] on says he is
[53:25] begging will there be a
[53:27] bride that can
[53:30] feel what he is
[53:32] feeling and say
[53:34] God I will give you that
[53:38] [Applause]
[53:42] love some of us
[53:46] say God don't need my
[53:50] worship God doesn't need me to
[53:52] demonstrate that I love
[53:55] him then you haven't understood who you
[53:58] are you haven't understood who you are
[54:01] for
[54:04] God BR brother brandham
[54:07] says go ahead and go jump to the last uh
[54:10] quote
[54:17] say the message the resurrection of
[54:20] Lazarus he says that's what's the matter
[54:23] with the Pentecostal
[54:25] people they don't recognize who they
[54:28] are your sons and daughters of
[54:32] God you have in your hand
[54:38] look then Jesus it was one time quoted
[54:40] in the scripture ye are God look
[54:45] D I'm a part of Charles
[54:47] BR because I was born from Charlie
[54:50] brandham I'm a part of
[54:53] him I've got my forehead like him
[54:57] my hair was like
[54:58] him I'm a small man like
[55:01] him I'm in the nature like him because
[55:05] he's my
[55:09] dad and if we become in spirit sons of
[55:13] God dwells
[55:17] Hallelujah then you talk about blind
[55:19] eyes being
[55:21] open they said nothing impossible to God
[55:26] God said nothing impossible with you if
[55:30] you believe it not with god with
[55:35] you is in
[55:40] man oh
[55:42] brother this is what I want us to
[55:44] see are you for
[55:47] God who are you for
[55:50] him you're not just a
[55:52] creation you came out of him
[55:56] part of
[55:57] him an attribute of
[56:00] [Applause]
[56:03] God God needs
[56:08] you if you are his
[56:14] bride identified in
[56:17] him identified in
[56:22] him sometimes we identify with him
[56:27] but we have to identify in
[56:31] him to really understand who we
[56:34] are we need to understand
[56:39] what that he feels
[56:42] like and we feel like he
[56:48] does know this is a little hard
[56:51] to because for so
[56:53] long we've thought
[56:57] that we are very different from
[56:59] God and the devil has made us
[57:03] think that we cannot be equivalent to
[57:07] him but God is here to tell
[57:11] us is here to
[57:13] tell Rise Up
[57:17] from are the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[57:20] Christ you are what came out of him
[57:24] [Applause]
[57:38] the very God that stood back there on
[57:39] the mythical platform of
[57:42] eternities and rolled worlds off his
[57:45] hands and created these
[57:48] things give you the privilege to be his
[57:51] son and you're a part of
[57:53] him and God dwells in man
[57:56] and man himself is hallelujah there you
[58:00] are it might choke
[58:03] you I see some of you
[58:06] choking drink a little bit of water
[58:09] spiritual
[58:11] water try to swallow a
[58:14] little but study over that a
[58:18] little he is God
[58:20] dwells and man becomes a Son of
[58:24] God not him and himself but the Holy
[58:27] Spirit that's in him is
[58:30] God the Creator lives in the creation oh
[58:34] my how I think of
[58:38] that then stand with an unwavering
[58:41] Faith ask what you will it'll be done
[58:44] unto you there he is God there he is
[58:56] now we must begin to see ourselves in
[58:59] him you say brother
[59:03] Titus how can I see myself in
[59:06] him you have to identify yourself in him
[59:10] your
[59:11] desires your spiritual
[59:14] desires I'm not speaking of desires of
[59:16] the
[59:17] flesh I'm speaking of spiritual
[59:20] desires your spiritual
[59:23] desires are the same desires that he has
[59:28] they're the same desires inside of
[59:32] God that's why this is
[59:35] important many
[59:41] times we're not
[59:45] able to give love to
[59:50] God or
[59:54] admiration when we don't see ourselves
[1:00:00] there there's a
[1:00:04] dictionary that somebody wrote in
[1:00:08] 1906 it's called The Devil's
[1:00:12] dictionary it's a book that's
[1:00:16] written and it's a book with many
[1:00:19] truths has
[1:00:22] words and it has the definitions the
[1:00:25] devil would give
[1:00:27] it for example for the word
[1:00:36] prejudice the definition for the devil
[1:00:39] would be a vagrant opinion without
[1:00:41] visible means of
[1:00:43] support think about
[1:00:47] that prejudice a vagrant
[1:00:52] opinion without visible means of support
[1:00:56] that's the
[1:00:57] truth
[1:01:01] Prejudice and then the word admiration
[1:01:04] appears in this dictionary and it
[1:01:13] says admiration the definition the devil
[1:01:16] would give it would be our polite
[1:01:18] recognition of another's resemblance to
[1:01:23] ourselves many times we don't admire
[1:01:26] somebody unless they look like
[1:01:32] us the people we admire are the ones
[1:01:34] that look like
[1:01:36] us yes or
[1:01:39] yes if they look very different from us
[1:01:42] I don't like them I don't like
[1:01:44] that doesn't matter how much good they
[1:01:48] have they're not like I am
[1:01:58] our polite recognition of another's
[1:02:00] resemblance to
[1:02:04] ourselves I believe there's truth in
[1:02:08] this we can
[1:02:12] love while it's from
[1:02:16] ourselves as long as it seems it looks
[1:02:18] like
[1:02:21] us we cannot love a gorilla the same way
[1:02:27] well now I hear different types of
[1:02:30] things but that's a perverted
[1:02:33] love that's a perverted love but
[1:02:37] pure true
[1:02:40] love someone we can identify come on
[1:02:44] Church true love pure
[1:02:49] love identified with
[1:02:51] someone when you say I am like you
[1:02:56] you like
[1:02:57] me we are the
[1:03:00] [Applause]
[1:03:03] same that's what God wants to teach
[1:03:06] us many times we can't love him admire
[1:03:10] him think he's too different from
[1:03:15] us yes or yes
[1:03:18] brother we come to
[1:03:20] church and we see him
[1:03:22] afar when he's right here
[1:03:26] he's loving you he's ministering to
[1:03:29] you what are you doing for
[1:03:32] him how would you like
[1:03:37] it that you tell your
[1:03:40] spouse I love

[1:03:46] me and they would just look at you like
[1:03:55] be honest how would you like it be
[1:03:58] honest if you gave it

[1:04:12] everything I'm doing for
[1:04:14] you and they
[1:04:17] just
[1:04:23] okay I ask myself if that's the reason
[1:04:25] why there's no Worship in
[1:04:28] church I ask myself if that's the reason
[1:04:30] why people are
[1:04:32] quiet because they simply don't identify
[1:04:35] with him come on
[1:04:38] Church he's simply not on your
