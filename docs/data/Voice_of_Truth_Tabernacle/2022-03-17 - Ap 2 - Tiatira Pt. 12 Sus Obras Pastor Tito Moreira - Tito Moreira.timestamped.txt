[20:10] [Music]
[20:48] [Music]
[20:56] [Applause]
[21:02] thank you for doing the effort
[21:06] i know it's not easy to come to church
[21:08] during the week
[21:11] we're working
[21:14] many
[21:38] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[21:40] works unto the end to him will i give
[21:42] power over the nations
[21:52] and he shall rule them with a rod of
[21:54] iron as the vessels of a potter shall
[21:56] they be broke into shivers even as i
[21:58] received of my father
[22:02] and i will give him the morning star
[22:07] i want to focus on the first verse we
[22:09] read
[22:23] his works
[22:52] yes
[22:55] [Music]
[23:06] on
[23:20] you will fulfill
[23:47] last week we spoke how god needs
[23:58] says in the message the wedding of the
[24:01] lamb they say the
[24:29] because he says you have nothing to
[24:31] overcome
[24:33] but you have to do something
[24:38] now we understand what we must do
[24:42] what you and i should do is
[25:12] the things we love songs
[25:16] and brother branham says god isn't going
[25:17] to take away
[25:20] until you let them go
[25:23] so that's what we spoke about
[25:50] the greatest enemy i got is william
[25:52] branham
[26:08] is
[26:20] he's the one that gets to a place
[26:22] sometimes when he thinks he can do it
[26:25] and when he does
[26:29] fuera
[26:30] that shoves god right out of the picture
[26:36] but when i can get rid of that guy
[26:44] when i can get to a place that he is out
[26:46] of the way entonces
[26:54] then god can come over and do things
[26:56] that william branham knows nothing about
[26:58] it
[27:01] that's when god can use you all
[27:04] that's when god
[27:18] [Music]
[27:53] and we spoke of the things that make up
[27:55] our ego
[27:57] [Music]
[27:58] estrestoria our ego is our story
[28:14] that doesn't
[28:28] about
[29:15] [Music]
[29:25] being right
[29:28] i have i'm right
[29:33] that makes us feel like we're better
[29:34] than the rest
[29:36] of them
[29:37] we know what we're doing and the rest
[29:40] don'ts
[29:43] that's why
[29:48] we gossip and speak about the rest
[30:06] or better about yourself
[30:13] if we accomplish
[30:16] to let go
[30:19] so let go of our ego que yo no
[30:29] now we're going to speak about this
[30:31] he says verse 26
[30:37] it says see that overcometh and keepeth
[30:39] my works
[30:45] notice it's not saying we must keep our
[30:47] own words
[31:57] but if it is
[32:26] repeat after
[32:39] [Music]
[32:54] i need to make sure what i'm doing are
[32:56] his works
[32:57] not my own
[32:59] but it also lets me know
[33:02] the question
[33:04] that i have to do what he did
[33:22] do
[33:29] now that sounds like something very hard
[33:35] what should we do
[33:39] how can we accomplish
[33:44] to do what he did
[33:49] to do his works
[33:52] how can we accomplish that bueno libra
[33:55] de felipe capitolo dos we'll read
[33:57] philippians
[33:59] this is the way
[34:02] that jesus did what he did
[34:06] this is the way he accomplished
[34:10] what he did on earth
[34:13] and this is the way you and i
[34:16] also accomplished to do his works
[34:36] but in loneliness of mine let each
[34:38] esteem other better than themselves
[34:44] not every man on his own things but
[34:46] every man also on the things of others
[34:52] jesus now spanish says let this mind be
[34:54] in you which was also in christ jesus
[34:57] [Music]
[35:02] jesus forgive me in spanish it says let
[35:04] this feeling but in english it says let
[35:06] this mind correct
[35:08] that's right in english
[35:13] in english it says let this mind and
[35:15] this is actually the right word
[35:18] because everything begins in the mind
[35:24] remember when we spoke about the mind
[35:28] and what the
[35:42] that's where
[35:54] repeat if i accomplish to have the mind
[35:56] of jesus
[35:59] i'll be able to do what he did
[36:02] okay
[36:03] that's why it says
[36:08] jesus let this mind be in here
[37:18] but made himself of no reputation
[37:23] and took upon him the form of it
[37:26] was made in the likeness of men
[37:30] and being found in a fashion as well
[37:33] he humbled himself
[38:32] that you can keep his works
[38:37] you must have the same mind he did
[38:39] okay
[38:40] now see what brother branham says
[38:44] i'm gonna
[38:58] now let's go back a little on his life
[39:00] and see what he did
[39:03] when he was honest
[39:07] the bible said he made himself of no
[39:08] reputation
[39:11] yeah he was the creator
[39:20] or how many of you have false teeth
[39:26] this
[39:37] but the man who made them first no
[39:39] reputation had no
[39:54] jesus
[40:06] he didn't care
[40:26] [Music]
[40:57] [Music]
[41:41] is
[41:56] he didn't have to impress anyone
[42:14] the man who made an artificial arm made
[42:16] himself a reputation
[42:20] but the man who made your real arm
[42:25] he made it
[42:27] of himself no reputation
[42:29] is that right
[42:32] now he may he was a humble man
[42:39] and here he didn't claim to be anything
[42:41] of within himself
[42:55] it was jesus
[42:56] [Music]
[43:53] you to earth
[43:55] and was not to be made in angels
[43:59] he came down on earth and took the form
[44:01] of a bondsman
[44:04] not an angel
[44:34] in order to pay the penalties
[44:40] the bible said he was made a little
[44:42] little lower than the enemies
[44:45] in order for death
[44:48] that he
[45:28] he was probably a little skinny spinly
[45:30] looking fellow nose
[45:33] didn't look like a king
[45:36] do you notice
[45:41] a handsome man
[45:59] he was a
[46:00] a horrible
[46:02] horrible looking
[46:05] he wasn't there was no beauty to desire
[46:10] nevertheless he did it
[46:39] [Music]
[47:30] many times the people judge people by
[47:32] the way they dress or by the by their
[47:34] statures
[47:36] we
[47:50] man is not judged by how big he is and
[47:52] how strong is his muscles
[47:57] by character
[48:00] and character alone
[48:06] i've seen men that way 200 pounds and
[48:08] didn't have
[48:11] all great vehicles
[48:14] good suits
[48:16] mascaras the most expensive things
[48:59] i'm gonna go back to the second quote
[49:03] jesus
[49:04] and the message seeking after jesus
[49:09] watch the ministry of our lord el
[49:11] norreclamos
[49:13] he didn't he did not claim to be a great
[49:16] person
[49:19] come by the way of a stable door salio
[49:22] por la pena capital went out the way of
[49:25] capital punishment
[49:28] sola
[49:31] owned about one garment in his lifetime
[49:36] [Music]
[49:40] and our wardrobes fall you know
[49:42] he's
[50:14] and my lord jesus
[50:17] maybe only one garment
[50:20] that's the one he had
[50:22] me or jesus my lord jesus
[50:28] that's how he conquered el noli
[50:32] how he looked
[50:37] a jesus no important
[50:42] [Music]
[50:49] if he had the best clothes or if he
[50:51] didn't
[51:06] [Music]
[51:32] he took on himself of knowledge
[52:44] oh
[52:56] but every time god confirms
[53:09] what we want
[53:10] come on
[53:32] [Music]
[53:35] [Applause]
[54:03] [Music]
[54:37] if you don't like that they tell you
[54:38] that you're wrong
[54:42] it's our ego
[54:44] no no
[54:46] we don't like to be told we're wrong
[54:50] we'd like to always be right
[54:52] that's ego
[54:56] that makes us feel like something
[54:58] better than that because i'm right
[55:17] strip yourselves before god unless you
[55:18] will trying to do something within
[55:20] yourselves
[55:23] i hope that gets down deep to us

[58:00] you rise above god
[58:03] you've got to keep yourself up
[58:06] and on the
