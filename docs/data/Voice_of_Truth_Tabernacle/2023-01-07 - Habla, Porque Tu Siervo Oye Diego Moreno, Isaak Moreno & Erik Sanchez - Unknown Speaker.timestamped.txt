[30:46] [Music]
[30:59] amen God bless you
[31:00] certainly good to be in the house of God
[31:03] once again
[31:06] amen if we can open up our scriptures
[31:10] the book of First Samuel uh
[31:15] chapter one
[31:17] verse one better through five amen hasta
[31:22] Cinco
[31:23] amen if you could say man when you have
[31:25] it
[31:27] amen I'll go ahead and read it and it
[31:31] says like this it says now there was a
[31:33] certain man of Ramadan zofim of Mount
[31:36] Ephraim and his name was elkana the son
[31:39] of johoram the son of elihu the son of
[31:42] tohu the son of zuff the an F right
[32:02] efrateo
[32:04] and you have two wives the name of the
[32:05] one was Hannah and the name of the other
[32:07] panina and penina had children but
[32:09] Hannah had no children
[32:22] and this man went up to up out of his
[32:25] City yearly to worship into sacrifice
[32:27] unto the Lord of hosts and Shiloh and
[32:29] the two sons of Eli hoffney and Phineas
[32:31] the priests of the Lord were there
[32:33] foreign
[32:50] portions
[33:00] suparte
[33:12] but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion
[33:14] for he loved Hannah but the Lord has
[33:16] shut up her womb I'm not
[33:24] enough
[33:28] amen you can have your seeds may the
[33:30] Lord has a blessings
[33:33] amen we're going to be talking about a
[33:35] new Bible character
[33:40] amen we're going to be talking about
[33:41] Samuel
[33:43] remember I believe that if we're going
[33:45] to talk about salmon we have to talk
[33:47] about his mother amen
[33:51] amen so I'm gonna be touching a little
[33:53] on Hannah
[33:56] Amen in the let's get right into it amen
[34:01] amen so we see here that Hannah was
[34:04] steriles
[34:06] amen and what does it mean for a woman
[34:08] to be sterile
[34:11] for a woman to be sterile
[34:14] it means that a woman is incapable of
[34:17] producing life
[34:22] amen there's something in our body that
[34:24] doesn't allow her Ayala
[34:27] to carry a child the way that a Other
[34:30] Woman do amen
[34:34] and I was doing a little bit of research
[34:37] on
[34:40] the sort of emotions that the sterile
[34:44] women go through sometimes
[34:49] Amen in a couple of them
[34:54] a couple where they feel incomplete
[35:06] they feel like a failure
[35:10] they have low self-esteem
[35:15] they have self-pity uh
[35:20] uh lastima and they have lots of Hope
[35:22] for future happiness amen experience
[35:31] amen and all of these attributes are are
[35:34] characteristics that go to somebody
[35:35] who's unfruitful amen
[35:43] and amen and we see that Hannah wasn't
[35:45] the first thorough woman in the Bible
[35:51] amen some of the two there were two more
[35:53] prominent people that were also sterile
[35:55] all right
[35:59] and there were Sarah and Rachel amen
[36:04] amen the only difference was that that's
[36:07] uh the way that Hannah reacted to being
[36:10] sterile Unica
[36:12] difference
[36:15] amen lost faith in God when she found
[36:18] out she was terrible
[36:24] and then she took matters into her own
[36:27] hands amen
[36:29] [Music]
[36:32] and Rachel became jealous of her sister
[36:37] and she also did the same because she
[36:40] gave her servant to Jacob
[36:45] remember nonetheless all these women
[36:47] desire children
[36:52] amen but I found something interesting
[36:57] is that the Bible says that Sarah the
[37:00] Bible never states that Sarah Rachel
[37:01] turned to God
[37:08] but they turn to their husbands
[37:13] or to their own ideas amen
[37:16] so it kind of made me wonder
[37:20] how they turn to God
[37:24] had they turned to God
[37:27] then perhaps they could have had more
[37:29] children or children early on Amen uh
[37:36] but that's how Hannah differed from
[37:38] these two
[37:40] and man because the two women before
[37:42] Hannah tried to take matters into their
[37:44] own hands
[37:50] however Hannah gave herself to God
[37:56] and he showed Hannah
[37:59] that God honors a faithful heart amen
[38:04] see it was God that shut up Hannah's
[38:07] womb from the beginning
[38:09] that she shut up he shut up Hannah's
[38:12] womb from the beginning
[38:15] it doesn't say that Hannah was sick
[38:20] or does she had any kind of medical
[38:22] condition
[38:25] [Music]
[38:27] all of the Bible specifies
[38:30] specific is that God show up Hannah's
[38:33] womb amen
[38:35] now that gives me the impression that
[38:38] she was a perfectly healthy woman
[38:43] but that God was just putting her
[38:45] through a trolley
[38:49] amen and why why does God put us through
[38:51] trials
[38:53] sometimes God puts us through trials
[38:56] to turn us to God
[38:59] or for God to come to us amen
[39:04] or sometimes trials motivate us to cry
[39:07] out to God
[39:08] [Music]
[39:10] other times they lead for us to
[39:12] personally examine ourselves amen
[39:17] and they draw us to his word amen
[39:23] praise be to God
[39:27] amen amen amen I believe that we're all
[39:30] like uh Hanan that we all desire life
[39:32] amen
[39:35] amen but life is only found in in one
[39:38] place
[39:41] amen and sometimes it's hard to find but
[39:44] it's it's hard to find but it's
[39:45] everywhere amen
[39:48] amen life is found in God
[39:51] and in his words
[39:57] amen
[40:03] praise be to the God Amen
[40:07] amen and it also says here that that
[40:10] um Hannah's husband had another wife
[40:16] her name was
[40:21] Hannah's rival era
[40:24] the Bible flat out says that that there
[40:27] was tension between these two women
[40:47] is that we're inevitably gonna run into
[40:50] opposition
[40:55] whether or not we look for
[40:58] it'll be there amen amen
[41:02] a couple of examples
[41:05] amen Moses and Israel Moises
[41:09] with Egypt uh
[41:12] Nehemiah and the builders
[41:17] they they also were discouraged
[41:21] by the local people amen and even the
[41:24] Lord Jesus
[41:26] the most perfect human being also had
[41:29] opposition amen
[41:32] amen praise be to God
[41:37] amen now if you keep going in the story
[41:39] of Hannah
[41:42] you find that Hannah went that uh he she
[41:45] went as far as she could to obtain
[41:47] Samuel amen
[41:53] amen so that just asked the question
[41:57] is how far are we willing to go to
[41:59] obtain life
[42:03] Hannah went to give herself completely
[42:06] to God
[42:10] even the very thing that she wanted
[42:14] the only son that she would have ever
[42:16] had
[42:19] she was willing to give it away man
[42:26] it shows that Hannah loved God
[42:29] it shows that Hannah's desires were for
[42:32] God Amen
[42:36] what God was going to give to Hannah
[42:39] Hannah wanted to use to give back to God
[42:42] Amen
[42:44] amen so then what do we do with what God
[42:46] gives us
[42:49] do we give it back to God
[42:52] do we glorify God with what he's given
[42:54] us
[42:56] amen that's why we don't that's why we
[42:58] don't receive sometimes amen
[43:01] because our motives aren't right amen
[43:04] brother Branham says in the message
[43:07] Fellowship
[43:09] he says the right mental attitude
[43:13] towards any promise of God
[43:17] we'll bring it to pass
[43:20] amen he says if you'll take the right
[43:22] attitude
[43:24] that is God's word
[43:26] and God is behind his words
[43:29] and the word is God
[43:32] it'll bring to pass what it says
[43:36] so as long as it's in God's Will
[43:39] and as long as your heart is right and
[43:42] aligned with God's will
[43:43] is
[43:45] amen then there's no reason to worry
[43:48] about whether or not our prayers are
[43:49] answered amen
[44:16] she might have never had Samuel amen
[44:19] Samuel
[44:21] and David might have never gotten
[44:23] anointed
[44:25] and that would have went on down the
[44:27] line yes
[44:29] but to the Lord Jesus amen
[44:33] amen praise be to God
[44:37] amen and one last thing before I close
[44:42] is that when Hannah wants to go pray in
[44:44] the temple
[44:47] not only did they think she was weird
[44:49] because they thought she was drunk
[44:54] amen but but something really caught my
[44:57] attention when I began to read her
[44:59] prayer
[45:03] and it's that in the middle of Hannah's
[45:06] you know sobbing and crying out to God
[45:10] is
[45:13] that Hannah asked to be remembered of
[45:15] God
[45:20] amen I think that's enough
[45:23] if God doesn't ever answer a single one
[45:26] of my prayers
[45:29] as long as he remembers me
[45:32] that's enough amen
[45:35] amen it brings back to mind
[45:38] the teeth that was next to Jesus
[45:45] but all he asked for was that he
[45:48] remembered him
[45:50] amen I just want to be remembered
[45:54] amen how many want God to Remember You
[45:59] amen I think all of us want God to
[46:02] remember us
[46:04] remember do we remember God Amen
[46:14] do we remember God
[46:18] only when we're in need
[46:21] only when we're in church
[46:25] when do we remember God
[46:28] Amen if you want God to remember
[46:32] they remember him
[46:35] let him be the first thing
[46:38] that you think of when you wake up
[46:42] and the last thing that's on your mind
[46:44] before you go to bed
[46:45] and I guarantee you
[46:48] that all of us will be over there
[46:51] one day together amen
[46:54] God bless you
[46:57] [Applause]
[47:03] hey man how many are excited to be here
[47:05] amen hey man I'm excited right now man I
[47:10] don't want to see the things of God like
[47:11] a burden anymore
[47:16] we usually see things of God
[47:21] you see when I have to be asked to
[47:23] preach
[47:25] I see it as a burden I have to study I
[47:30] have to spend time with God
[47:32] a lot of times we don't want to do that
[47:35] we should already be doing that
[47:39] but I'm excited right now don't have a
[47:43] good attitude towards the things of God
[47:47] Samuel's attitude
[47:50] man God bless you Brothers sorry I'm
[47:53] just excited
[47:56] getting excited about the things of God
[48:00] I hope you guys are excited too
[48:04] hope you guys aren't here just to feel
[48:06] uh
[48:10] our title for tonight
[48:14] or speak thy servant here is
[48:18] and as a subtitle I've put
[48:23] who are you running to a quienes
[48:26] amen our my brother Diego spoke a little
[48:29] bit about Hannah
[48:33] Samuels Samuel's mother Madre de Samuel
[48:36] is there a woman that couldn't have a
[48:38] child amen
[48:40] but God's word sunk into her heart
[48:44] she knew by faith that she was going to
[48:48] have that child
[48:50] amen I just want to read um first Samuel
[48:53] 3 1.
[48:56] El Tres Uno
[49:00] and it says like this
[49:02] and the child Samuel ministered unto the
[49:04] Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord
[49:06] was precious in those days there was no
[49:09] open there was no open vision
[49:12] is
[49:26] the word of the Lord in those days
[49:30] was rare amen yes
[49:34] um
[49:35] says and it came to pass at that time
[49:38] when Eli was laid down in his place and
[49:40] his eyes began to wax them that he could
[49:42] not see
[49:43] yeah
[49:53] and for verse 3 I want to read The New
[49:56] International Version
[49:59] because I didn't understand it at first
[50:03] the Lamb of God had not yet gone out and
[50:06] Samuel was lying down in the house of
[50:08] the Lord where the Ark of God was
[50:20] estaba and when I read that and it says
[50:23] the Lamb of God has not gone out yet
[50:27] a lot of times in our lives we think the
[50:29] lamp of God has gone now
[50:32] the lamp of God has not gone now yet
[50:34] amen
[50:35] I heard a quote is
[50:40] he said as long as you're not get dead
[50:42] God is still amen
[50:54] and then um I just want to speak on that
[50:57] verse one right there
[50:59] you see we see that the the word of God
[51:03] in this time was rare amen
[51:06] you see what I think it means by what I
[51:09] believe what it means
[51:14] they had gone so far away from God
[51:19] that the word was just common now
[51:22] see they just had the truth I mean they
[51:26] just had knowledge
[51:29] but they didn't have the truth
[51:32] it was just common things for them to
[51:34] hear the word of God
[51:39] to get information
[51:42] but it was hard to get the truth amen
[51:46] see we get away from God
[51:49] sometimes the word becomes so rare to us
[51:54] we're so cold amen
[51:58] yeah raise our hands
[52:01] we're just coming just to come so let me
[52:03] tell me the times
[52:05] amen a lot of times I just come just to
[52:07] come here
[52:09] well before amen
[52:13] but you know when God really stirs
[52:15] something up inside
[52:17] and you feel that
[52:56] [Music]
[53:04] you
[53:12] see we have so much access to the word
[53:15] of God
[53:19] but it's not the axis that you have
[53:21] anymore
[53:22] it's what type of attitude you have
[53:24] towards the word of God
[53:26] what kind of attitude are you going to
[53:28] have towards the word of God Amen
[53:31] amen have a good attitude
[53:32] or a bad attitude amen see during this
[53:36] fastest I really enjoyed watching my dad
[53:39] so far amen
[53:43] he's not a big um
[53:45] if I could say healthy eater amen
[53:51] I'm not either but
[53:54] um
[53:55] it's funny to see them
[53:58] get happy with healthy food amen
[54:02] and we're talking one day yes he's like
[54:06] I don't want to have a bad attitude
[54:07] towards this anymore
[54:09] I don't want to complain no more I don't
[54:13] want to complain no more
[54:14] and if we could do that for the things
[54:16] of God I'm sure I'm sorry if we could do
[54:18] that for the things
[54:20] we could just have a good attitude
[54:22] towards the things
[54:24] I'm not complaining anymore amen
[54:27] amen
[54:29] you see a lot of us instead of
[54:31] worshiping God
[54:34] we worship our ideas of God and rather
[54:37] than being in a relationship with God
[54:42] and instead and then being in a
[54:45] relationship with God in business
[54:46] started
[54:48] we want God to be a resource amen
[54:51] who is more like a Siri than than a
[54:54] savior amen
[54:57] Siri Siri yeah like on your phone
[55:02] man we just want to ask things of him
[55:09] hey God heal me me hey God I need this
[55:13] hey God give me this but see we never
[55:16] hear God out amen
[55:19] you see and when um Samuel cuando Samuel
[55:23] I don't want to read it all because I
[55:24] don't have much time
[55:26] when God called Samuel
[55:30] you see we see Samuel got up and he or
[55:33] actually hold on sorry I want to read
[55:36] this quote
[55:40] um it's um hear his voice is
[55:43] sorry Brothers I'm just a little excited
[55:48] and I said see we got too many things
[55:50] ahead of the Lord
[55:53] you can't have the prayer meeting
[55:55] because Mr Godfrey Frey is on tonight
[56:04] you can't have the prayer meeting
[56:06] because we love Susie is on tonight
[56:13] or some kind of or some kind of foolish
[56:15] nonsense like that
[56:19] that takes up the time
[56:21] and we don't have time to hear the voice
[56:24] of the Lord
[56:25] and those who do claim to be Christians
[56:29] just kneel down with a little prayer
[56:33] like this kind of homemade Lord bless me
[56:39] and my family and take care of me good
[56:42] night
[56:43] and the next morning rise and say is
[56:47] just guide us through the day God yeah
[56:51] good day we we should wait on the Lord
[56:56] you see we do all the Talking pero
[56:59] figures
[57:01] we don't give him a chance to talk back
[57:04] to us
[57:06] that if we would pray and pray until our
[57:09] soul comes into the presence of God
[57:16] and then just relax and listen to his
[57:19] voice
[57:21] see a lot of the times we can't be
[57:23] healed
[57:25] we can't come out of things because we
[57:29] don't just listen to his voice
[57:31] we just want to ask and ask and ask
[57:36] but when have we ever stopped
[57:39] in silence you just say Lord speak to me
[57:45] see in verse 10 universe
[57:48] but it says and the Lord came and stood
[57:50] and called at and called as at other
[57:54] times Samuel Samuel then Samuel answered
[57:56] speak for thy servant tears
[58:09] see a 12 year old
[58:14] was able to stand still and studies
[58:20] I tell the Lord speak
[58:23] to me amen and you see I wanna I wanna
[58:27] make something clear tonight
[58:30] say that until we treasure the voice of
[58:32] God
[58:33] until we value the time of the voice of
[58:36] God
[58:37] until we make time for God
[58:41] until we consecrate ourselves
[58:45] we can't just be skimming the surface
[58:48] foreign
[59:14] you see I just want to speak a little
[59:15] bit about how Samuel yes
[59:19] he kept running back to Eli amen
[59:24] you can read it when you go home verses
[59:27] 1 through 10.
[59:34] but when the Lord first called Samuel
[59:37] pero La primeroes
[59:39] it says
[59:43] you see and that really impacted me yes
[59:47] because they said he he ran
[59:49] you see they were already sleeping
[59:53] they were probably tired I don't know
[59:57] but I see that Samuel still had that
[59:59] passion amen
[1:00:02] you see he read
[1:00:06] you see and a lot of times you know we
[1:00:08] have that passion
[1:00:10] but we run to the wrong things
[1:00:23] you see and I'm glad that Eli finally
[1:00:26] had the Revelation yes
[1:00:32] I think the Lord is trying to speak to
[1:00:34] you
[1:00:36] and I want to be around people
[1:00:39] I want to rub against people
[1:00:42] are going to lead me to God
[1:00:45] give me good advice
[1:00:47] they're gonna stir up that gift inside
[1:00:50] of me
[1:00:51] so that we can rise as one amen I want
[1:00:55] to fight alongside my brother Alex
[1:01:00] but a lot of times we're running to the
[1:01:02] wrong things
[1:01:04] we're running to the wrong people amen
[1:01:07] we're running back to our addictions
[1:01:16] I wonder why we're so depressed
[1:01:20] looking at others lives
[1:01:23] instead of looking at God's life
[1:01:26] instead of reading the word
[1:01:29] that will bring us up amen
[1:01:33] amen amen
[1:01:35] Hallelujah you see at some of the things
[1:01:38] we have gone wrong in our lives are some
[1:01:40] of the mistakes we have made you know
[1:01:45] it was God stirring us up amen
[1:01:50] but we keep running back
[1:01:54] we keep running to things that God was
[1:01:56] trying to remove from our lives
[1:02:01] because that's what we're used to amen
[1:02:04] that's what we're familiar with
[1:02:07] that is what our mind understands
[1:02:10] but we need to get out of that out of
[1:02:12] that zone
[1:02:14] when you understand that there's bigger
[1:02:16] things out there
[1:02:17] you see we need to understand that
[1:02:19] there's something greater amen
[1:02:22] you see I was hearing our pastor is
[1:02:25] and you know when he was preaching on
[1:02:27] Wednesday
[1:02:29] he said he doesn't want to raise a lazy
[1:02:31] Church
[1:02:35] he's going to be pushing us
[1:02:38] he's not going to let us rest amen
[1:02:41] that really touched me yes because
[1:02:44] sometimes you just want to rest amen
[1:02:47] sometimes Sunday is the busiest day we
[1:02:50] have amen
[1:02:52] we think we're gonna rest
[1:02:55] but in reality
[1:02:58] but I realized when he said
[1:03:02] it's not time to rest Brothers it's time
[1:03:05] to push forward
[1:03:06] it's time to push forward
[1:03:08] that's trying it's time to stir up the
[1:03:11] gifts inside of us
[1:03:15] you see but we also a lot of the times
[1:03:18] when we find out we have a gift
[1:03:22] you see when I when we have a gift of
[1:03:24] playing instruments
[1:03:27] you see my dad says I have a gift of
[1:03:30] talking to people
[1:03:33] a lot of times we use it for the wrong
[1:03:35] reasons
[1:03:42] you see but we have to understand
[1:03:45] that those gifts were ours like they
[1:03:49] they weren't we didn't get those gifts
[1:03:51] just out of nowhere
[1:03:54] we gotta understand that God gave us
[1:03:57] those gifts
[1:03:59] that God gave you your healing that God
[1:04:03] gave you your strength amen God gave you
[1:04:06] the talent that you have amen
[1:04:11] now I want to finish with this
[1:04:13] foreign
[1:04:22] I see something I just want to relate
[1:04:24] something to like you know a lot of
[1:04:26] times we're watching videos Amen on
[1:04:28] YouTube
[1:04:31] you see whatever you watch
[1:04:36] um and you know sometimes those ads pop
[1:04:38] up amen
[1:04:40] [Music]
[1:04:43] because they're of no importance to us
[1:04:45] amen importance you see there's a video
[1:04:49] of I don't know but they're not they're
[1:04:51] no importance to us amen the
[1:04:55] the importance you see we want to get
[1:04:57] back to the main thing that we're
[1:04:58] watching
[1:05:00] we want to get back to the main purpose
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:04] see I feel like in this season of my
[1:05:07] life
[1:05:09] I want to do important things amen
[1:05:16] I believe my calling is valuable
[1:05:21] and the people that we are with it's
[1:05:23] important because things are contagious
[1:05:24] amen I'm sorry the people we are with
[1:05:29] it's important because things are
[1:05:31] contagious
[1:05:34] people telling me what I did last season
[1:05:36] anymore
[1:05:39] I don't need people teaching me how to
[1:05:41] sit on a bench
[1:05:45] or how to go out into the world
[1:05:47] but I need them to push me forward
[1:05:51] I want to ride I want to rise
[1:05:55] man and I want to overcome whatever's
[1:05:57] around me
[1:05:58] I don't got time for those other things
[1:06:00] anymore
[1:06:01] I only got time for the things of God
[1:06:04] and I believe you this is a critical
[1:06:06] time amen
[1:06:08] and we have to give ourselves to God we
[1:06:11] have to run to God and let him speak
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:15] amen God bless you
[1:06:19] [Applause]
[1:06:23] [Music]
[1:06:26] God bless you Brothers
[1:06:29] how many are happy with the word
[1:06:33] I think there's uh more than one sister
[1:06:37] because
[1:06:38] that can identify themselves with Hannah
[1:06:41] how many youth can identify with Samuel
[1:06:45] medium
[1:06:47] let's open our Bibles
[1:06:53] first of Samuel chapter three
[1:06:56] [Music]
[1:06:58] and all the way to verse 10.
[1:07:04] first Samuel chapter 3 verse 1.
[1:07:09] verse 10.
[1:07:13] [Music]
[1:07:21] and the Lord came and stood and called
[1:07:24] as at other times Samuel Samuel then Sam
[1:07:27] Samuel answered speak for thy servant
[1:07:30] heareth
[1:07:32] a second scripture in in Juan Diego's uh
[1:07:36] in John chapter 10 verse 27
[1:07:40] years
[1:07:47] my sheep hear my voice and I know them
[1:07:50] and they follow me
[1:07:55] and I give them unto them eternal life
[1:07:57] and they shall never perish neither
[1:07:59] shall any man plug them out of my hand
[1:08:01] today
[1:08:16] I'm muchas there's many voices
[1:08:20] it's like a war of voices
[1:08:24] there's voices condemned
[1:08:34] that they
[1:08:37] decide to do what's wrong
[1:08:41] that is scared
[1:08:44] that suggests
[1:08:46] that
[1:08:48] distracted the destructive voices
[1:08:52] now look
[1:08:54] there is
[1:08:56] going back to Samuel 3.
[1:09:00] here he said that Samuel was a young man
[1:09:07] he was he was no longer a kid
[1:09:11] already grown a little bit he was a
[1:09:14] young man
[1:09:20] and this is a story writer uh Josephus
[1:09:24] is
[1:09:28] around the age of 12.
[1:09:31] is
[1:09:33] that around the age of 12. the young man
[1:09:41] enters into the age the responsibility
[1:09:43] of responsibility and accountability
[1:09:47] and I believe this is what happened with
[1:09:49] Samuel momentum
[1:09:52] there came that time when he stopped
[1:09:54] being a kid
[1:09:56] that had been destituted
[1:10:01] I have been dedicated to God
[1:10:03] to be a young man
[1:10:08] the time of responsibility or
[1:10:10] accountability
[1:10:15] and you know
[1:10:18] yes cuando
[1:10:21] that's why he has to make a decision
[1:10:28] when God speaks to him for the four by
[1:10:31] the fourth time
[1:10:34] and since Samuel answers
[1:10:37] I believe at the same time
[1:10:40] as he responds
[1:10:44] he will follow God or not and he says
[1:10:49] speak for thy servant heareth
[1:10:54] was pointing
[1:10:57] the initial he was starting to initiate
[1:11:00] a transformation with Samuel Samuel was
[1:11:04] the young guy named Samuel Nino that
[1:11:07] that young man
[1:11:09] have been dedicated to him now when I
[1:11:13] was a young man
[1:11:14] and I believe que dios that God
[1:11:18] would start to use
[1:11:20] or better said he was do not use him
[1:11:23] in a tremendous way
[1:11:26] in a supernatural way because later
[1:11:31] Isaac said for a moment
[1:11:37] there was no vision
[1:11:40] it was difficult
[1:11:42] for the people of Israel
[1:11:45] hear the voice of God
[1:11:48] but God had something foreign
[1:12:15] yes
[1:12:18] you made it now look this is Brother
[1:12:21] Brown says that a vision is
[1:12:25] the the direct a voice of God
[1:12:30] the voice of God in that time
[1:12:34] to hear God's voice
[1:12:37] and in that time was something strange
[1:12:40] it was something scarce
[1:12:45] how many of us have not been through
[1:12:47] scarce times
[1:12:49] imagine that time
[1:12:51] the word of God was scarce
[1:12:54] there was no vision
[1:12:57] there was no vision with uh with
[1:13:00] frequency the true voice of God was
[1:13:03] something scarce it was hard
[1:13:07] to hear someone speak of God why
[1:13:13] because the people had Departed
[1:13:17] yes they had a church
[1:13:19] but I believe his only religion
[1:13:22] that they only follows
[1:13:26] the Commandments of Jehovah
[1:13:31] or would only follow or would believe
[1:13:35] what they wanted to believe
[1:13:39] they had a minister called Eli
[1:13:51] the the
[1:13:54] Commandments that people wanted to hear
[1:13:57] and I believe it's a parallel of this
[1:14:00] these times
[1:14:02] today we come
[1:14:05] we only want a hero he wants it here
[1:14:08] and the pastor calls my attention oh I
[1:14:12] get angry I want to go to church
[1:14:27] our pasture
[1:14:40] they had Departed
[1:14:44] to hear the word of God with something
[1:14:47] scarce he
[1:14:49] and you know
[1:14:52] today nowadays
[1:14:55] the voice of Satan
[1:14:58] makes himself more Audible
[1:15:01] we
[1:15:02] today
[1:15:05] nowadays they paint it this way
[1:15:07] when you're watching TV commercial and
[1:15:12] they passed the ad of beer all of the
[1:15:15] cigarettes
[1:15:16] or they talk about moderation
[1:15:19] moderation they say
[1:15:48] or we give everything to him
[1:15:57] sorry
[1:16:01] you know the voice of Satan is more
[1:16:04] audible
[1:16:05] that there's no time left
[1:16:08] to hear the word of God
[1:16:12] brother Brown says that in those voices
[1:16:17] is the voice of pleasure
[1:16:21] to the pleasure of this flesh
[1:16:26] and we get lost in those other voices
[1:16:31] the voice of God
[1:16:34] we distract ourselves
[1:16:39] the voice of God
[1:16:42] Santa's bosses so many voices
[1:16:45] that that trip out my senses
[1:16:48] we can't distinguish the voice of God
[1:16:51] look
[1:16:55] is
[1:16:57] I will share the story that our brother
[1:17:00] Brandon tells us
[1:17:05] and it speaks of this person that would
[1:17:08] collect gold
[1:17:09] there in Phoenix Arizona
[1:17:12] there came a time when he found so much
[1:17:15] code
[1:17:17] that from night to day he was made into
[1:17:19] a millionaire yeah
[1:17:21] he had barrels and barrels of gold
[1:17:26] and his point and his his point was to
[1:17:29] go into that cabin and rest
[1:17:31] but what he didn't notice
[1:17:33] that there was other eyes watching him
[1:17:36] and they were looking at him look what
[1:17:39] her brother says
[1:17:41] when he gets to this point
[1:17:43] to this cabin
[1:17:47] he was laying in his pillow thinking
[1:17:52] oh tomorrow I would change these nuggets
[1:17:54] for currency
[1:17:56] I will buy Great Cars
[1:17:59] whiskey and I will drink good whiskey
[1:18:02] I would do all these things it is
[1:18:06] and have a big time
[1:18:09] and I will go to Every dance
[1:18:16] day dreaming that
[1:18:18] is
[1:18:27] he went to the door and opened the door
[1:18:29] and said shut up
[1:18:31] and the dog whined
[1:18:34] he was tied to a leash
[1:18:38] and he tried to warn his master
[1:18:43] and he laid down in his bed
[1:18:45] and again the dog started barking again
[1:18:50] he would tell him once and again shut up
[1:18:54] I don't want to hear you
[1:19:03] I want for me I want a lovely dream
[1:19:07] tonight of the good times I'm going to
[1:19:08] have tomorrow when I have cash in my
[1:19:10] gold
[1:19:13] and finally the dog barked again
[1:19:16] he became angry
[1:19:20] he reached in the corner and got a
[1:19:22] double-barreled shotgun
[1:19:24] went to the door
[1:19:28] with both hammers back
[1:19:32] and shot the dog down to death said
[1:19:37] that'll take care of you
[1:19:39] I won't need you anymore
[1:19:43] he set the gun down and lay down on the
[1:19:47] on bed and folded his hands with his
[1:19:51] dream and fell off to sleep
[1:20:05] a saber knife into his uh
[1:20:11] and left with it okay oh what did he do
[1:20:17] he killed that voice that was warning
[1:20:20] him
[1:20:24] not be our stance
[1:20:27] oh the voice of the Holy Spirit
[1:20:34] and we see the approaching of the Lord
[1:20:40] and turning it away
[1:20:44] to the warning that it gives us
[1:20:47] amen amen to the warning that it gives
[1:20:50] us the musicians may come forward
[1:20:53] oh goodness use
[1:20:58] it's also a warning voice
