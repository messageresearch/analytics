[28:57] Jesus Christ
[28:59] CH amen amen uh you may be
[29:02] seated uh for a title this
[29:05] morning uh we uh we uh brother brother
[29:09] elas and
[29:10] I uh decided to title it the compassion
[29:12] of
[29:15] Jesus Amen uh and uh you know uh last
[29:20] week you know when I was coming to
[29:22] church in the
[29:24] morning you know I started asking myself
[29:29] uh you know what would I what would I be
[29:32] doing you know if I wasn't uh coming to
[29:35] church on
[29:38] Sundays uh you know I it was just a
[29:41] question that kind of just popped in my
[29:43] head as I was
[29:47] coming and uh uh you know uh I thought
[29:51] about it for a little
[29:53] bit and uh I I think that I'd be uh
[29:57] I'd be doing I I personally
[30:01] believe I'd be uh I'd be trying to uh
[30:05] I'd be trying to win souls to
[30:09] Hell amen amen you know because I'm I'm
[30:13] I'm doing what I can right now for
[30:17] Jesus I mean it may sound like it's kind
[30:20] of
[30:22] ridiculous but you know at that
[30:25] point you know uh
[30:27] we see some we we see that uh you know
[30:30] what you're what when Paul for
[30:34] example uh when he uh when he before he
[30:38] has his experience with the
[30:41] Lord you know he was he was he was
[30:44] killing all the
[30:46] Christians but then you know after his
[30:49] experience you know he had a
[30:53] transition get a complete
[30:56] 180
[30:58] and uh he was trying to win every
[31:00] Everybody he could for
[31:03] Christ so you know I that's what I
[31:06] that's what I think I'd be
[31:09] doing you know I I asked brother
[31:13] Tito you know what brother Tito what
[31:15] would you be
[31:16] doing you know if you weren't here at
[31:19] church serving the
[31:22] lord and uh he he he told
[31:25] me he said uh I'd probably be an
[31:28] executive
[31:33] somewhere in a
[31:35] company but I believe he is an
[31:38] executive I believe he's an executive
[31:40] for the
[31:42] Lord you know Proverbs
[31:46] 11:30 it says you know the fruit of the
[31:48] righteous is a tree of
[31:52] life and he that winth Souls is
[31:56] wise and you know when you sit there and
[31:58] think about
[32:00] it you know winning Souls is a tough
[32:05] business it's not easy to win
[32:08] souls you know brother brandham says
[32:11] that the hardest thing for for a man to
[32:14] do is to believe another
[32:18] man so you know a lot of people think
[32:20] that uh you know people that go to
[32:22] church are kind of you know slow or or
[32:24] kind of
[32:26] dumb
[32:31] uh but but that's that's not
[32:33] true uh that's a
[32:36] lie uh because you know you have to be
[32:38] really
[32:40] wise I I personally
[32:43] believe uh that you know uh brother Tito
[32:46] could have been anything he wanted to
[32:50] be I believe he if he if he if he
[32:53] purposed in his
[32:55] heart to be a president of the United
[32:59] States believe that's what he could have
[33:03] been how but he chose a greater
[33:08] work he chose a greater
[33:12] work it is to win souls for
[33:15] Christ amen amen you know I was uh
[33:18] listening to a I heard a brother here a
[33:21] while
[33:23] back it was it was brother
[33:25] Donnie and he and he said this he said
[33:29] you know uh there's a when I leave this
[33:34] earth when I leave this
[33:38] earth he said I want hell to be uh to be
[33:41] having a
[33:45] party I want him to be to have a big old
[33:49] party oh when brother vial you know
[33:51] leaves this
[33:54] Earth You know when brother GMA leaves
[33:56] this Earth
[33:59] you know but you know a lot of
[34:01] times it seems like you know they're
[34:06] mourning in mourning because a lot of
[34:09] times there's people in
[34:11] church and they're the devil's best
[34:16] instruments and you know it shouldn't be
[34:18] like that
[34:19] Brothers it shouldn't be that
[34:22] way you know when when I leave this
[34:25] earth you know we should want hell to be
[34:27] in a great
[34:31] celebration H because you know brother
[34:33] Tito isn't here
[34:36] anymore you know that that's the way it
[34:38] should
[34:40] be uh when you're winning
[34:43] Souls oh when you're snatching
[34:47] them oh from the devil's
[34:53] hands you know but before we can do that
[34:58] we have to have compassion for
[35:01] him we have to feel for the
[35:06] people amen amen we should we should
[35:09] feel for
[35:11] them you know I was I was
[35:14] meditating and you know there was a
[35:16] great multitude
[35:18] there and uh you know
[35:21] Jesus you know he had he had a great
[35:25] desire you know a great he he felt for
[35:29] them for for the for the
[35:35] multitudes but then I go to uh Mark
[35:38] chapter
[35:41] 10 and uh you know in that
[35:44] chapter oh you know he's uh he's talking
[35:48] to uh one person
[35:51] there and it was the Rich Young
[35:55] Ruler
[35:57] and uh the Bible says that Jesus loved
[36:05] him and uh I
[36:07] believe that Jesus had compassion for
[36:10] him as
[36:12] well just like he had a compassion for
[36:15] the people that were
[36:20] hungry I believe he had the same kind of
[36:23] compassion for this man that had
[36:25] everything
[36:30] it sounds kind of uh it sounds kind of
[36:32] hard sometimes to
[36:36] understand now how could he have
[36:41] compassion for
[36:43] somebody uh that appeared to have
[36:45] absolutely
[36:48] everything it almost doesn't make
[36:53] sense because you know you see somebody
[36:55] that owns everything
[37:00] the man had a lot of
[37:02] businesses he had a lot of money but he
[37:05] had a lot of
[37:07] influence but he had all these
[37:10] things but Jesus still has compassion
[37:20] for and uh you know in one of the
[37:25] Gospels
[37:27] this young
[37:31] man he tells Jesus this in Matthew
[37:37] 19 he says the young man said unto
[37:41] him all these things I have kept from my
[37:46] youth what lack I
[37:50] yet so what what are the things I see
[37:54] here is that although he had
[37:59] everything he was lacking one
[38:04] thing and he didn't know what it
[38:07] was he didn't know exactly what he was
[38:13] needing oh you would think he would have
[38:15] been
[38:17] filled that he that that that he had
[38:19] everything that life could
[38:23] offer but he was lacking
[38:28] and Jesus had compassion on him
[38:31] too you know I come to a a a
[38:36] point you know where I I
[38:39] realize I realize that that
[38:41] Jesus you know he has compassion for all
[38:46] people you know and and when Jesus uh
[38:49] sees the the
[38:51] people and he sees their
[38:55] hunger he sees their
[38:57] need I want to keep reading on in chap
[39:00] on verse
[39:02] 15 Matthew
[39:04] 14 it says and when it was
[39:09] evening his disciples came to him
[39:13] saying this a this is a a desert
[39:18] place and the time is now
[39:21] passed send the multitude
[39:24] away that they may go into the village
[39:26] and buy themselves
[39:31] victuals verse 16 says but Jesus said
[39:35] unto
[39:36] them they need not
[39:39] depart give you them to
[39:43] eat you see Jesus you see he wasn't the
[39:48] disciples were
[39:51] worried that they didn't have enough to
[39:53] feed the
[39:55] people
[39:57] see they were trying to send them
[39:58] somewhere
[40:00] else when when when that isn't that what
[40:04] we do a lot of
[40:06] times you know you send your kids to
[40:09] church I bet you you don't want to deal
[40:11] with
[40:13] them you just send them
[40:16] off it's nobody else's
[40:19] job you know to do what you should
[40:23] do you see Jesus said to go do it
[40:28] I so I believe you need to do
[40:30] it because he asks
[40:32] them they start asking
[40:36] themselves I don't have
[40:39] enough but Pastor said this
[40:43] morning he says you have
[40:45] enough Jesus gave you
[40:49] enough it gave you enough to do the
[40:55] job
[40:57] he gives us
[41:00] enough the problem is we try to have
[41:02] somebody else do our
[41:06] job and it shouldn't be that
[41:08] way he sends them
[41:11] off up you know he sends them to go get
[41:13] some
[41:15] food let's read verse
[41:18] 16 because Jesus was worried about them
[41:21] being
[41:23] hungry you see Jesus doesn't want you to
[41:26] leave here
[41:28] empty he he wants to satisfy your every
[41:33] need every need you
[41:36] have he wants you to leave here
[41:39] filled he doesn't want you to leave here
[41:44] complaining you know fighting
[41:49] or you see if you leave here like
[41:52] that I'm almost wondering if you didn't
[41:55] eat
[42:00] we come here to eat
[42:04] amen amen
[42:07] amen verse 17
[42:10] says and they say unto
[42:13] him we have here but Five Loaves and two
[42:20] fish he said bring them hither to
[42:25] me
[42:28] that's he told me to go figure out how
[42:31] much they
[42:34] had so I my uh my question to you
[42:40] is how much do you
[42:43] have how much has God given
[42:48] you a lot of times were real
[42:53] sting we don't want to let go
[42:56] of what God gave
[42:59] us because we're just worried about what
[43:02] we
[43:04] need we're worried about what we
[43:08] want but Jesus knows what you
[43:12] need he knows what you
[43:15] need you don't worry about
[43:19] tomorrow or you got to worry about what
[43:21] Jesus told you to
[43:25] do
[43:29] we're so worried about
[43:33] tomorrow I'm almost
[43:36] wondering if Jesus ever did anything for
[43:39] some of
[43:42] us oh you know it just uh when I sit
[43:45] there and think about
[43:47] that oh you know I just I I just think
[43:49] about you know my my own uh my own walk
[43:53] with the
[43:55] Lord
[43:57] you know it was something you know extra
[44:01] special uh because I believe had never
[44:03] experienced that something like that in
[44:05] my whole
[44:07] life you know the the the the action you
[44:10] know that was
[44:13] taken just it's it's it's it's
[44:16] incomparable oh you know because when
[44:18] the Lord really saves
[44:22] you when the Lord has compassion on you
[44:27] when he feeds
[44:28] you and when he clothes
[44:31] you and when he gives you
[44:34] Joy when he gives you
[44:36] peace when he gives you
[44:39] happiness then then I believe you should
[44:43] be so
[44:45] happy I like you just can't hold it
[44:48] in you just have to express
[44:52] it you have to let it
[44:54] out you can't keep it
[44:57] in to much to
[45:00] hold when God has really done
[45:03] something then it just takes you it
[45:07] moves you are you want to tell
[45:11] somebody what Jesus
[45:13] did and may be
[45:15] little but give it to
[45:18] Jesus give it to Jesus and it'll be
[45:21] something great you'll turn that little
[45:24] thing
[45:27] into something
[45:36] bigu when you do those
[45:39] things that's when you know the the Lord
[45:41] really did something for
[45:44] you that's when you know you're really
[45:49] saved that's when you
[45:52] know that God has done something in you
[45:56] it wasn't something
[45:59] momentary it wasn't just something that
[46:01] passes
[46:03] by oh no it wasn't
[46:06] emotion it wasn't just
[46:09] sensation it was something
[46:12] else it was a
[46:14] passion it was a
[46:16] desire that was burning inside of
[46:19] you that won't let you stay
[46:23] still I don't believe there's been a
[46:25] thing in my
[46:27] life that has made me act the way the
[46:30] word of God
[46:36] does of course you know if you don't
[46:38] know my
[46:42] past a lot of people wouldn't
[46:47] know but it just did something to
[46:51] me it just touched my heart so
[46:54] much
[46:56] you know that I I I did things I had
[46:58] never
[47:01] done you know I I never
[47:05] thought you know I'd be a i i I'd sing
[47:08] for the
[47:10] Lord much less preach for
[47:14] him amen amen but he makes you do
[47:19] things you know it just touches you in
[47:22] such a
[47:23] way uh and and you know you just you
[47:26] just got to share
[47:28] it you have to share it with the
[47:32] people because God did
[47:35] something you see when he does those
[47:38] things it just it just tears you to
[47:43] pieces because you want people to
[47:46] know if there was any
[47:50] way for me to tear a piece of my heart
[47:54] out
[47:56] and be able to give it to my
[47:59] son be able to give it to my
[48:02] daughter be able to give it to my my to
[48:05] any
[48:07] brother I would do it I would do
[48:11] it because God I believe he gave me a
[48:16] piece of who he
[48:19] is that's what makes me preach the way I
[48:22] do that's what makes me cry
[48:26] it makes me cry for the
[48:28] people makes me cry for my
[48:31] wife makes me cry for my
[48:36] children Hallelujah it turns you to
[48:41] pieces when they gave him those love
[48:43] when they gave the loves to the
[48:47] people they had to be
[48:52] broken they had to be broken
[48:57] so that the people could
[49:01] eat I wonder how many people
[49:06] here don't feel
[49:11] Broken Hallelujah you know Jesus
[49:14] said I am the bread of
[49:20] life so if he's the bread of
[49:24] life who's the bread of life in this
[49:28] day who is the bread of life in this
[49:31] day it's the
[49:34] church because everything he
[49:37] was he deposited in the
[49:43] church when people come to
[49:47] you and they're crying for
[49:50] help they want you they want to
[49:53] eat they want what you have
[49:59] you got to feed
[50:03] them the sad thing
[50:06] is we act like these
[50:09] disciples we act like they we don't have
[50:13] anything we act like we we act like we
[50:16] Jesus never did
[50:19] anything the whole reason you're
[50:22] here is because Jesus did something
[50:28] Jesus has blessed
[50:30] you and I believe that when he talks to
[50:33] that Rich Young
[50:36] Ruler I believe he
[50:38] saw how great of an
[50:42] influence that man could have
[50:45] been he had
[50:47] influence he could have been somebody
[50:51] great but
[50:53] instead he was taking the people to
[51:00] hell you know there's
[51:02] people I'm uh there's
[51:06] people in hell right
[51:09] now that are more worried about about
[51:13] their loved
[51:17] ones than we are right
[51:20] now amen amen in the Bible uh there's a
[51:26] rich young
[51:28] ruler that after he rejects the
[51:30] leadership of the Holy
[51:33] Ghost the next time we see
[51:36] him and he's in hell and he's trying to
[51:40] do
[51:42] something trying to do something for the
[51:45] people but by then it was too
[51:48] late you see but he was
[51:51] worried he was worried for the
[51:54] people
[51:55] but it was too
[51:57] late my question
[51:59] is what about
[52:01] you what are you going to
[52:04] do for the people around
[52:07] you the people that you work
[52:10] with the people you live
[52:15] with what will we
[52:17] do with what God has given
[52:22] us lot of times we got to bear with them
[52:27] a lot of times we got to
[52:30] P we got
[52:32] a let them know that they're not
[52:35] alone we're not going to leave them
[52:38] behind a lot of times we got to back
[52:42] them you know I don't believe the lord
[52:44] gave me these shoulders just
[52:48] because I got to
[52:50] pull I got to pull with the
[52:53] pastor I got to pull with brother Al
[52:57] p with
[52:59] Brother
[53:00] P and we may be
[53:03] tired but God gave us
[53:06] enough he gave us
[53:08] enough he gave you
[53:11] enough it may be a little
[53:14] testimony but it's
[53:16] enough it's enough to win
[53:19] souls I leave you with this
[53:22] Andrew uh you know Peter's
[53:26] brother he only
[53:29] did one outstanding thing it appears
[53:31] like in the
[53:34] Bible but he did one
[53:37] thing he went to go
[53:40] testify he went to go
[53:42] testify he testified to
[53:45] Peter and that one
[53:50] testimony it changed the whole
[53:53] world it caused a revolution
[53:58] changed
[53:59] it your
[54:01] testimony you don't know of what it
[54:04] could
[54:05] do until you speak
[54:09] it with that I'll leave it to our
[54:22] brother God bless your brother VI
[54:26] if you can please
[54:31] stand presently in
[54:35] humanity worried about what's going to
[54:37] happen in the
[54:40] future many of the times Us in
[54:43] church we are thinking about what will
[54:48] happen really focus on what is happening
[54:50] right
[54:52] now God is making himself present right
[54:54] now
[54:56] now brother if we come to
[55:01] church take advantage coming to
[55:05] church I see some
[55:08] people that are worried more about their
[55:12] Ministry because they have to play
[55:14] because they have to do
[55:17] something take advantage of the
[55:19] opportunity that God gives them in this
[55:22] very
[55:23] moment the way you're
[55:26] standing I'm
[55:31] not but I feel something I don't know if
[55:34] you feel it
[55:35] tonight I'm feeling
[55:39] something there in Philip Philippians
[55:46] 2:5 if there be therefore any
[55:49] consolation in
[55:51] Christ sorry verse five let this mind be
[55:55] in you which has also in Christ Jesus
[55:58] you may be
[55:59] seated The Compassion of
[56:03] Christ Jesus had a
[56:07] compassion and this compassion was so
[56:10] great was this passion was so
[56:14] great and so
[56:19] motivated nothing can move him from his
[56:22] purpose know the devil Satan Lucifer
[56:27] Lucifer one
[56:29] day he was standing in his post of
[56:33] Duty and there in his post of
[56:36] Duty he began to
[56:39] say
[56:40] [Music]
[56:41] well this year will
[56:44] finish what what is next you're waiting
[56:46] for
[56:48] me what I did is not
[56:50] enough I want to do something
[56:53] greater I want to be something
[56:56] greater that thought is
[56:59] okay it's
[57:01] okay but he himself preached
[57:05] something still preached to each and
[57:07] every one of
[57:09] us and the preaching he
[57:12] preached that he himself
[57:16] believed is that it wasn't
[57:20] enough enough what he was
[57:23] doing he wanted something
[57:27] greater sometimes God gives us something
[57:29] so simple a position our duty so
[57:34] simple that we want to be the people who
[57:36] are over there in the
[57:40] front we want to be
[57:42] seen to be
[57:44] praised but
[57:48] this but this feeling wasn't in
[57:52] Christ the the the feeling that was in
[57:54] Christ was something something
[57:56] different and this feeling that was in
[58:01] Christ when he saw his
[58:04] creation what he had
[58:07] created
[58:08] Fallen
[58:11] Fallen brother God didn't make his
[58:13] creation to be fall God didn't make it
[58:16] for
[58:18] that brother brand the message
[58:23] identification
[58:25] when God looked upon his last
[58:30] creation his last creation after he had
[58:32] made it and fashion the way he wanted it
[58:34] brother
[58:36] says and I I like to look at it in its
[58:42] origination I love the
[58:47] outdoors because there that must be the
[58:49] way he
[58:52] wants he wouldn't have made it that way
[58:56] and we come around and pervert
[59:00] it and make something out of it that
[59:03] doesn't please
[59:07] him he says but his loving
[59:10] character molded
[59:16] it God saying that his life and his
[59:18] great plan and creation of mankind to
[59:20] inhabit the
[59:21] Earth and to live in peace and to never
[59:26] never to be
[59:27] sick or have a heartache or any
[59:32] worry or the way that the father
[59:34] provided for us and that was that was
[59:36] his
[59:38] desire do for us to be in that
[59:44] way us to be in a dying shape as we
[59:48] are this and the condition that the
[59:51] world is today is never the desire of
[59:56] mean that at
[59:59] all brother Brown was saying I was
[1:00:01] hearing this
[1:00:05] morning some somebody presently in in
[1:00:07] this
[1:00:10] earth and I know that brother BR could
[1:00:12] see the
[1:00:14] future
[1:00:16] somebody somebody weird in this
[1:00:19] time is someone that lives
[1:00:23] correctly that's how brother says it for
[1:00:26] the world
[1:00:28] today somebody who lives
[1:00:30] correctly is somebody that's
[1:00:36] weird you live with your
[1:00:39] wife you're not
[1:00:42] homosexual that's something
[1:00:45] weird but it's not for
[1:00:48] God when he saw his creation that had
[1:00:53] fallen
[1:00:55] it was his own loving
[1:00:57] character molded
[1:01:00] himself into the person of
[1:01:05] Christ God's own character of
[1:01:08] Love projected
[1:01:10] himself in the man
[1:01:18] Christ a story that I love so
[1:01:22] much to show that compassion of
[1:01:27] Christ that purpose that Christ
[1:01:30] had is the story of the Good
[1:01:34] Samaritan in the story of the Good
[1:01:37] Samaritan there's different people
[1:01:40] there and brother brother BR says
[1:01:45] we should find
[1:01:48] ourselves in his
[1:01:50] word each and every one of
[1:01:53] us should find ourselves in the word of
[1:02:01] God did you know that you should find a
[1:02:04] Bible
[1:02:05] character in the Bible that is similar
[1:02:07] to
[1:02:08] you so similar to
[1:02:12] you know because brother brother brah
[1:02:15] says that
[1:02:18] person we tell you who you
[1:02:22] are we'll tell you where you
[1:02:25] where you're
[1:02:26] going what is it you have to
[1:02:32] do well we see here the Good
[1:02:37] Samaritan but before the Good Samaritan
[1:02:40] had
[1:02:41] compassion of this injured
[1:02:45] man first there was this high priest
[1:02:48] that went through
[1:02:52] there I compare him with a minister Min
[1:02:55] or the
[1:02:57] preachers you know a preacher or a
[1:03:00] minister is his purpose is to serve the
[1:03:03] people that was his
[1:03:06] purpose to serve
[1:03:08] the is a public
[1:03:11] servant and when he saw this that was
[1:03:15] Fallen he probably
[1:03:19] said you know he probably doesn't belong
[1:03:21] to my
[1:03:23] church you know one time he did go to my
[1:03:26] church he was all drunk and drugged
[1:03:31] out he must have what he
[1:03:35] deserves but he didn't want to
[1:03:38] serve even though his per was to
[1:03:43] serve so he said well he doesn't belong
[1:03:45] to my
[1:03:48] family we are a family brothers and
[1:03:51] sisters we are a family
[1:03:55] are of the same
[1:03:57] body and don't tell
[1:04:00] me that if they step on your
[1:04:03] small the whole body doesn't
[1:04:06] hurt the whole body will
[1:04:09] hurt but this H this this
[1:04:14] Minister this
[1:04:17] preacher was without
[1:04:21] compassion but we see here a levite
[1:04:28] this l i see
[1:04:31] it as as that has a
[1:04:35] gift all the people that have a
[1:04:38] gift he was worried more about his
[1:04:45] gift he was worried about for fulfilling
[1:04:47] the gift that he
[1:04:50] had to help this person that was injured
[1:04:55] we worry
[1:04:58] more to be fulfillers of the
[1:05:03] church and to be fulfillers of our
[1:05:07] purpose in which God has called
[1:05:10] us our entire
[1:05:14] purpose God didn't just call us to come
[1:05:16] to church it's okay it's okay to come to
[1:05:22] church it's very
[1:05:24] come to church God didn't call us to
[1:05:27] come to church or to dress nice and put
[1:05:29] on a a tie to look
[1:05:34] good well even the devil does that with
[1:05:37] all due
[1:05:39] respect the devil does come to church
[1:05:42] too and he's here early it's not like
[1:05:46] brother
[1:05:47] Hernandez he's a little bit late no he's
[1:05:50] the
[1:05:51] first he's not the first one that open
[1:05:53] the door
[1:05:55] door but is the first one that touches
[1:05:58] or knocks on the
[1:06:00] door but we see this
[1:06:03] Samaritan and when we see this
[1:06:08] Samaritan the Samaritans nobody liked
[1:06:12] Sam wanted them close to
[1:06:23] them
[1:06:27] Heathen that that doesn't believe like
[1:06:29] we
[1:06:32] believe doesn't believe the message of
[1:06:35] the
[1:06:37] hour had compassion of
[1:06:40] someone that was
[1:06:47] injured and it says there in Luke
[1:06:53] 10
[1:07:06] how is it
[1:07:08] possible that
[1:07:12] somebody can have more compassion than
[1:07:15] us I'm going put it
[1:07:17] simple how is it
[1:07:20] possible that somebody be of the message
[1:07:23] of the hour
[1:07:25] have more
[1:07:26] compassion than someone that
[1:07:30] says believe the message that brother
[1:07:32] William Baron
[1:07:42] brought what was the the feeling inside
[1:07:45] of
[1:07:46] Jesus that being in the form of
[1:07:50] God he was the Almighty
[1:07:54] he was The Great I Am he is The Great I
[1:08:00] Am
[1:08:03] for what is
[1:08:13] form m a manner in which something is
[1:08:16] made or ures to motor container into
[1:08:18] which something is poral that acquires a
[1:08:20] shape of its
[1:08:22] whole
[1:08:27] as synonyms are formation aspect figure
[1:08:30] appearance image configuration and
[1:08:33] structure so God in this great structure
[1:08:36] of
[1:08:37] God he couldn't
[1:08:40] do a lot for
[1:08:43] us religiously speaking
[1:08:47] us if we put ourselves very
[1:08:50] religiously we will do nothing for our
[1:08:52] brother or sister
[1:08:56] we will try to fulfill all the
[1:08:58] scripture in that
[1:09:01] form God could not help
[1:09:06] man we will be able to help our
[1:09:10] brother or our sister being
[1:09:13] religious because being
[1:09:16] religious we want to fulfill the
[1:09:19] law to the
[1:09:22] letters and we want somebody else to
[1:09:24] fulfill it
[1:09:28] too almost Force other people to fulfill
[1:09:31] before we
[1:09:32] do but this feeling wasn't in
[1:09:36] Christ so in that form of
[1:09:47] God so he didn't
[1:09:50] just want to be
[1:09:52] God
[1:09:54] oh everybody has to serve
[1:09:56] me I am an object of
[1:09:59] Praise everybody has to worship me no
[1:10:03] sir God did
[1:10:06] not
[1:10:08] we hold to our own way of living our own
[1:10:12] way we're
[1:10:19] very
[1:10:22] stubborn
[1:10:41] but God
[1:10:50] didn't but he let go of himself
[1:10:55] took a form of
[1:10:57] a being similar to
[1:11:01] man similar to
[1:11:03] ourselves
[1:11:06] why why did he make himself
[1:11:09] Sim but he couldn't because he could
[1:11:11] feel what we
[1:11:15] feel he had to come down to our
[1:11:19] level he made himself in form of sin not
[1:11:23] in sin
[1:11:25] form of
[1:11:27] sin he made himself
[1:11:29] man to be able to suffer like
[1:11:33] we cry like
[1:11:37] us do you feel maybe
[1:11:42] despised that they put you
[1:11:45] aside that they don't take you into
[1:11:49] account that's how the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:52] felt that same way the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:11:58] felt God understands each and every one
[1:12:00] of
[1:12:01] us God understands
[1:12:04] us but we try to get a hold
[1:12:10] of our of our old ways of
[1:12:14] living let me tell you that
[1:12:18] God has what we
[1:12:22] need
[1:12:24] Jesus Christ is our
[1:12:28] reward in the message
[1:12:32] identification no other nature could do
[1:12:35] it it was
[1:12:39] fallen and God identified
[1:12:43] look God identified himself as a
[1:12:48] man and took upon him the form of
[1:12:52] sin now well not
[1:12:55] sin but the form of
[1:13:00] sin that in order that he might take the
[1:13:02] sin of The
[1:13:05] Sinner and pay the penalty for
[1:13:08] it and give the
[1:13:11] sinner back the life that he had before
[1:13:16] the oh my what love God has expressed to
[1:13:20] us think of it now
[1:13:24] remember after Jesus doing this when no
[1:13:28] one else could do
[1:13:30] it we are
[1:13:33] invited we are
[1:13:36] invited each and every one of us are
[1:13:38] invited now
[1:13:40] Church think of this just a
[1:13:44] minute we are
[1:13:48] invited to shape our own
[1:13:52] character to
[1:13:58] his brother I don't know if it only
[1:14:00] happens to
[1:14:03] me I don't feel comfortable with my own
[1:14:07] character I feel like something is
[1:14:11] missing fight and fight and fight with
[1:14:13] your own
[1:14:14] character with the inheritance of your
[1:14:19] parents Jonah was someone that was
[1:14:22] angrier
[1:14:24] and there's a lot of
[1:14:26] M for any little for
[1:14:29] anything comes out goes out of its place
[1:14:33] and we get
[1:14:35] mad the brother's not doing what he
