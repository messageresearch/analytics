[3:54] see myself in the future um
[4:02] i see myself with my family with my dad

[4:10] kids bullying me and making fun of me
[4:14] god has helped me with some
[4:17] tests that i've been doing at school to
[4:20] trust in the lord and to be brave
[4:24] god has taken care of me with many
[4:26] things
[4:31] [Music]
[4:39] um pray and read the bible
[4:44] shout outs to my mom and dad
[4:47] my name is emmanuel i'm 13 years old and
[4:50] i'm in eighth grade i would fix
[4:53] my grades not do drugs
[4:57] [Music]
[4:59] in college
[5:05] he has helped me by not catching the
[5:08] virus
[5:10] um to have faith in god
[5:15] um with my schoolwork
[5:19] my name is alyssa alfords and i'm a 12th
[5:22] grader
[5:24] all the moments i procrastinated
[5:28] it would be to procrastinate less
[5:32] i was walking in the wrong class for
[5:34] straight two weeks freshman year
[5:38] i see myself already graduated from
[5:41] college
[5:42] and having my own small business
[5:47] i would say all the homework they gave
[5:49] us
[5:51] god has helped me so much because
[5:53] there's been so many stressful moments
[5:55] that i had to go through
[5:57] being in school and god has helped me
[5:59] calm all those stress levels down
[6:03] i encourage kids to put always god first
[6:05] and he will help you
[6:06] a lot just always put god first and pray
[6:10] before your exams
[6:14] i would give a quick shout out to all
[6:16] the teachers that helped me
[6:17] and pushed me and also my parents as
[6:19] well
[6:21] my name is mariana ferrer i'm 19 and i
[6:24] am no longer in high school thank god
[6:28] some things i could go back and fix are
[6:32] too
[6:34] be more better at my time management and
[6:37] to not try to find my
[6:41] closest friendships in school something
[6:43] i can do to help my future
[6:45] would be to take every step that i
[6:49] or every choice and decision to god
[6:51] first before i make it
[6:54] funny thing that
[6:57] happened to me in school was i got him
[7:00] with the basketball in the face and my
[7:01] glasses
[7:02] broke in the future i see myself
[7:05] as a teacher for kindergarten i hope
[7:08] and maybe even trying to start a
[7:11] homeschool for
[7:12] the families and veteran church
[7:15] the thing that i least liked about
[7:17] school
[7:18] is the whole system honestly pretty much
[7:21] sucks
[7:23] god has helped me with postponing
[7:27] due dates on assignments that i couldn't
[7:29] finish
[7:30] or just allowing me to
[7:34] find happiness in him rather than in
[7:38] friendships in school or other things
[7:42] for other kids i encourage that
[7:45] you find god
[7:48] in everything you know and the simplest
[7:51] things and
[7:52] that friends from school aren't always
[7:54] gonna
[7:55] fulfill that happiness or joy that you
[7:57] need
[7:58] god's the best realest and truest friend
[8:01] that you can find
[8:05] words of encouragement i would give is
[8:09] that being yourself is the best you
[8:12] that's that's how i did it
[8:16] shout outs to my mom and dad
[8:19] for supporting me
[8:22] and at the same time being strict enough
[8:26] and having that balance with me so that
[8:28] i can
[8:29] succeed more at school i'm ruby i'm
[8:33] 13 years old and i go to 8th grade
[8:36] some things i could go back and fix was
[8:38] probably
[8:40] the decisions i made this year and like
[8:43] the friends i chose to
[8:44] hang out with look for god definitely
[8:48] and surrender my life to him probably
[8:52] still being the pianist of the church
[8:54] and
[8:55] hopefully still following god
[9:01] probably when we all got back from a
[9:03] field trip
[9:04] and everyone like left and i kind of
[9:07] just got stuck outside and i couldn't go
[9:09] back in
[9:10] um probably all the bad influences
[9:16] and he's helped me being able to trust
[9:19] my mom and
[9:20] for the data and like tell them if i
[9:22] ever need something if i'm struggling
[9:27] probably just like be yourself
[9:30] and don't don't follow what bad people
[9:34] do because
[9:36] it can lead you into a big trouble
[9:39] through brother dito because he's helped
[9:42] me a lot to
[9:44] see that i can do good things if i can
[9:46] focus
[9:47] and ask god to help me well
[9:51] my name is timothy hernandez i am
[9:53] graduating from
[9:55] 12th grade and
[9:57] [Music]
[9:58] my alumni something i can do to help my
[10:02] future
[10:03] would be focusing myself more on god
[10:07] and seeking more of him definitely
[10:11] i see myself in the future with
[10:16] a stable job a family i see myself
[10:21] working with fifi in a job somewhere
[10:26] god has helped me till now by definitely
[10:29] protecting me
[10:30] and sometimes situations which i think
[10:33] were impossible to come out from
[10:37] and leading me through the right path
[10:41] what i encourage kids that are great
[10:44] graduating after me
[10:46] would be don't let peer pressure
[10:50] get the best of you it's not something
[10:54] i know i know it's sometimes it may be
[10:56] hard but it definitely is possible
[10:58] it's just a matter of focusing yourself
[11:00] on god
[11:01] and knowing that god is always there
[11:05] i shout out to
[11:09] my parents
[11:14] be happy
