[20:05] [Music]
[20:23] God
[20:25] said yes
[20:34] [Music]
[20:42] [Music]
[21:03] God bless you Brothers
[21:06] if you can open up your scriptures with
[21:09] me
[21:10] first Kings 19 15.
[21:17] watching us through the internet in
[21:19] Mexico and in Mexico California in
[21:22] California
[21:23] and in other places
[21:30] it says like this is
[21:42] and the Lord said unto him go return on
[21:44] thy way to the Woodlands of Damascus and
[21:46] when thou come is anoint has yelled to
[21:48] be king over Syria yes he says 16.
[22:05] and jehu the son of name she shout out
[22:07] anoint to be king over Israel and Elijah
[22:09] the son of Jeff
[22:12] anoint to be prophet in thy room
[22:15] foreign
[22:58] you may be seated
[23:02] my brothers along with myself
[23:06] come follow me
[23:09] the last time
[23:11] we've seen how Elijah oh he got to the
[23:15] cave
[23:21] Napoleon
[23:24] but Elijah wasn't running because he
[23:26] couldn't overtake Jezebel or anyone else
[23:28] says
[23:45] there was a prophecy
[23:49] how Jezebel would die a little further
[23:52] on
[23:55] power
[23:56] is
[24:00] more than what God had given Elijah
[24:04] but there was a scripture that had to be
[24:06] fulfilled
[24:08] why because God fulfills what he speaks
[24:12] right
[24:17] I'd like to read a second-handed robe
[24:19] preaching 56.
[24:22] is
[24:52] now God's seeing foreseen that Elijah's
[24:54] days were numbered that he had so long
[24:56] that he that he could stay on the earth
[24:58] as everyone has so he was going to have
[25:00] a successor to Elijah and when he did
[25:02] God called this man he wasn't in no
[25:04] Cemetery when God called him he was
[25:06] plowing in a field with the Yoke of ox
[25:08] doing the service taking care of his
[25:10] mother and father God called him to be a
[25:12] successor of Elisha or Elijah is
[25:23] that they was going to harass me up at
[25:27] the school they thought there was surely
[25:28] going to be a successor they thought
[25:29] they was going to wear his robe as soon
[25:30] as he was finished with it but God does
[25:32] the calling
[26:06] neither can we take nearly can we add
[26:09] one thing to our statue by taking
[26:10] thoughts foreign
[26:33] you come to church
[26:35] my parents bring me this is
[26:53] a purpose
[26:57] foreign
[28:02] to where he wants them to go
[28:18] that's why I did he just changed
[28:21] Messengers
[28:24] but the Same Spirit Elijah and Elijah
[28:30] he says how I wish I had time to enter
[28:32] it tonight
[28:38] to notice that when God had called the
[28:40] old Tire Prophet off the field
[28:46] he'd preached against Jezebel under
[28:47] worldly crowds
[28:51] ahabs and leaders
[28:54] Association
[28:56] and ministerial associations and
[28:58] everything
[28:59] so he was tired
[29:02] and God was going to take him home
[29:06] so we just brought him down to the river
[29:10] we are having a lot of time here
[29:13] and that time
[29:16] that time is determined by God
[29:19] you can make plans to live 100 years
[29:24] God is the one who gives life
[29:28] that's why we have to walk
[29:31] because we don't know if they're going
[29:33] to call us
[29:34] tomorrow for the following weeks or in
[29:38] 10 years he continues saying
[30:07] he must have took it back
[30:11] you just throw it across him
[30:18] he must have taken it back because it
[30:20] fell from his shoulders when he went up
[30:24] no I say you're not here by coincidence
[30:28] because there was also an Elijah in this
[30:30] time with the message
[30:39] but it also must be believed
[30:43] hearsay
[31:39] he did what he said
[31:45] to exercise that
[31:48] recuerdo estaba foreign
[31:58] foreign
[32:16] [Music]
[33:15] and I said yeah that's fine
[33:20] they prayed
[33:23] when they finished
[33:26] I told them will you allow me to pray
[33:28] and they said yes so I lifted up my
[33:32] hands
[33:33] and I made a prayer
[33:37] he
[33:38] is
[33:39] when I finished my prayer
[33:43] anointing of the Holy Spirit
[33:46] and there on the street
[33:48] they had a Revival
[33:51] a
[34:09] seed exactly
[34:20] because they took out their songs
[34:26] and there as just as Elijah
[34:31] God honored his true word the true word
[34:34] of God
[34:39] 1920. this is
[34:51] and he left the oxen and ran after
[34:53] Elijah and said let me I prayed he
[34:55] kissed my father and my mother and then
[34:57] I will follow thee and he said unto him
[34:59] go back again for what have I done to
[35:01] thee
[35:12] and he returned back from him and took a
[35:15] yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled
[35:17] their flesh with the instruments of The
[35:19] Oxen and gave unto the people and they
[35:20] did eat then he arose and went after
[35:22] Elijah and ministered unto him
[35:27] making the valley full of ditches
[35:29] preached in 1956
[35:41] now and when he's seen he was going to
[35:44] take Elijah Elijah went and found Elijah
[35:46] plowing in the field and he took off his
[35:48] robe and threw it on him and he knew he
[35:50] was called to be the prophet
[35:53] we see here a Heavenly calling
[35:57] Elijah didn't have to preach so much
[36:00] it was a supernatural calling
[36:07] professor then to show how a prophet is
[36:18] he took the yolks and made a sacrifice
[36:21] to the Lord is
[36:26] showing that all of his Earthly doings
[36:29] were over he was completely sold out to
[36:30] the Lord
[36:35] that's the way every man and woman that
[36:37] comes to Christ
[36:42] to completely sell out to sin and
[36:45] everything behind him cross the
[36:46] separating line and look only to God
[36:50] what a difference it would be if men and
[36:52] women would do that
[36:57] do you believe in the testing and trying
[37:01] adios
[37:05] every son without any exceptions every
[37:07] Sunday I cometh to God must first be
[37:09] tried and child trained
[37:35] not only that but his working tools that
[37:38] he had he burnt them in the field to
[37:39] make a sacrifice to God to show that he
[37:41] had really sold out everything to be a
[37:43] prophet of the Lord is
[37:54] and what a lesson we could get out of
[37:57] that tonight that every man that come
[37:58] into Christ puts his hand on the plow
[38:00] and starts and even turns to look back
[38:02] is not worthy of the plowing this is
[38:12] today the reason we're having such times
[38:14] as we are is because there's too much
[38:15] halfway conversation
[38:18] intellectual conversations
[38:22] there is two different elements in the
[38:25] human body that has a mind
[38:27] and one of them is reasoning
[38:32] one of them the reasoning is of the mind
[38:35] which is intellectual
[38:37] the other one is
[38:41] just not reasonable believes the words
[38:44] that's a true Revelation
[38:48] is
[38:50] you should put everything else aside
[38:55] to leave everything to leave the
[38:58] schooling the jaramigos to leave friends
[39:00] to leave the party to leave your job
[39:05] but how can you leave it
[39:16] but how can you leave it all is
[39:23] putting everything else aside
[39:26] putting God first before your children
[39:33] your friends
[39:35] putting everything else aside
[39:38] offering a sacrifice to God
[39:42] Lucas
[39:46] is
[39:48] I'd like to read Luke 9 59 or Luke 9 52.
[39:54] is
[40:01] Padre and he said unto another follow me
[40:05] but he said Lord suffer me first to go
[40:07] and bury my father Jesus
[40:12] Jesus said unto him let the dead bury
[40:14] their dead but go thou and preach the
[40:16] kingdom of God
[40:22] and another also said Lord I will follow
[40:24] thee but let me first go bid them
[40:26] farewell which are at my home at my
[40:28] house
[40:30] foreign
[41:06] maintain your eyesight or forward

[43:50] torch like they're passing a torch
[44:12] he was just a farmer you know
[44:15] boxing
[44:28] it was a change for Elijah
[44:31] and it says in the message
[44:37] God commissioning Moses Eliseo
[44:55] I can think of all the Elijah when
[44:58] Elijah had thrown his mantle on said
[45:06] he tells them to come and follow me
[45:09] and not only does he tell him
[45:12] he tells him follow him

[50:10] speaking or hearing your second
[50:12] opportunity

[51:53] come follow me the title
[51:59] is
[52:02] in the message Elijah and Elisha
[52:04] preached in
[52:07] 54.ora but now we come into another age
[52:10] now
[52:14] the age of dying out
[52:17] all your worldly pleasures
[52:31] if you don't die
[52:34] no more they say I'll remember he says
[52:48] anything else can only die
[52:51] of death comes alive
[53:00] wow

[53:20] we're not just any person
[53:25] the Lord says
[53:32] and with this I'd like to close
[53:35] and the message Witnesses
[53:38] Christian 53.
[53:51] Elisha took Elijah's place
[54:05] one day he started off and seen Elijah
[54:08] yeah
[54:09] and he threw his mantle and blessed
[54:15] sacrificial and he killed the oxen made
[54:17] a sacrifice
[54:21] showing that all the things of the world
[55:03] that's the only way I know how to say it
[55:06] is
[55:12] you have to burn that
[55:15] is
[55:20] you're the word of God is able to hear
[55:25] his voice
[55:29] that's a second chance
[55:33] tonight is
[55:36] to surrender to render your life to God
[55:40] the importance
[55:48] of the world
[55:54] don't need to be in our lives
[56:11] amongst the whole world
[56:14] something special
[56:17] and you have to die
[56:20] you have to die tonight
[56:38] foreign
[56:40] [Applause]
[57:12] [Applause]
[57:17] God bless you in this night
[57:20] I'm happy to be in the house of God
[57:23] again
[57:26] sometimes when you when you leave
[57:34] because God's presence is here
[57:37] amen amen I'm uh
[57:43] we're going to be speaking on Elijah
[57:45] Elijah Orlando De Eliseo we're
[57:48] transitioning from Elijah to Elijah
[57:53] and uh I'll be reading in Second Kings
[57:56] two boys
[57:59] and I'll be reading a couple verses get
[58:02] comfortable
[58:07] Second Kings 2 verse 1.
[58:12] and we also thank our pastor for the
[58:15] trustee grants us to use his Pulpit yes
[58:19] God for this opportunity
[58:22] and God's word reads
[58:25] and it came to pass when the Lord would
[58:28] take up Elijah into Heaven by a
[58:30] whirlwind that Elijah went with Elisha
[58:32] from gilgal a contest
[58:40] and Elijah said unto Elijah uh Terry
[58:45] here I pray thee for the Lord has sent
[58:46] me to Bethel and Elisha said unto him as
[58:49] the Lord liveth and as I so liveth I
[58:52] will not leave thee so they went down to
[58:55] bethelise
[59:06] verse 4 and Elijah said unto him Elisha
[59:10] Terry here I pray thee for the Lord has
[59:12] sent me to Jericho and he said as the
[59:14] Lord liveth and as I so liveth I will
[59:17] not leave thee so they came to Jericho
[59:20] Elias
[59:23] is
[59:33] verse six and Elijah said unto him Terry
[59:36] I pray thee here for the Lord has sent
[59:38] me to Jordan and he said as the Lord
[59:40] liveth and as I so live I will not leave
[59:42] thee and they went went to they went on
[59:45] vesiculo says
[59:56] verse a and Elijah took his Mantra and
[59:59] wrapped it together and smote the waters
[1:00:00] and they were divided hither and dither
[1:00:02] so they too went over on dry ground
[1:00:17] verse 9 and it came to pass when they
[1:00:19] were gone over that Elijah said unto
[1:00:21] Elisha ask what I shall do for thee
[1:00:24] before I be taken away from thee and
[1:00:27] Elisha said I pray thee led a double
[1:00:29] portion of thy Spirit be upon me is
[1:00:45] and verse 10 finally and he said thou
[1:00:48] has asked a hard thing nevertheless if
[1:00:50] thou see me when I am taken from thee it
[1:00:53] shall be so unto thee but if not it
[1:00:56] shall not be so verse
[1:01:06] now Elisha and Elijah or the Elias
[1:01:10] Eliseo two prophets those prophetas we
[1:01:14] got two prophets in this picture here
[1:01:17] and brother Branham says there the
[1:01:20] perfect type of Christ and the church
[1:01:25] he says Elijah is
[1:01:29] a type of Christo
[1:01:33] and Elisha the type of the church
[1:01:38] amen amen so
[1:01:42] just so this is uh I wanna I wanna speak
[1:01:45] to everybody I don't want to be too
[1:01:47] complicated
[1:01:50] so Elijah is a type of Christ all right
[1:01:56] an Elisha type of the church
[1:02:00] is that very easy to understand right
[1:02:05] but notice before Elijah leaves
[1:02:10] knowing that he has to leave
[1:02:13] he didn't leave Israel without a prophet
[1:02:17] or a witness
[1:02:21] he made a preparation
[1:02:24] to a man to take his place
[1:02:28] amen this is uh biblical it was and uh
[1:02:32] he left the people with a witness
[1:02:36] now if you remember
[1:02:38] when Jesus ascended
[1:02:42] he did the same
[1:02:45] typeismo a man he left
[1:02:48] as God God's witness
[1:02:51] and he made a preparation for a church
[1:02:55] like this and ordained that there would
[1:02:58] be Witnesses
[1:03:00] all the way through the church ages
[1:03:04] but what we just read here
[1:03:09] Jericho Jordan
[1:03:13] I just read it so you're not lost in the
[1:03:16] story
[1:03:18] well brother Branham says these are
[1:03:21] stages in the journey
[1:03:27] that the church has traveled through
[1:03:30] okay
[1:03:32] when the church came through the Dark
[1:03:34] Age
[1:03:37] went out of a Dark Age
[1:03:40] the first was Luther
[1:03:42] foreign
[1:04:41] Church followed by and so did the
[1:04:43] Methodist Church
[1:04:48] all right where he says but where my
[1:04:52] brother Josue left off his previous
[1:04:54] quote
[1:04:57] he says we come to another age now
[1:05:01] he says the age of dying out loud
[1:05:06] to all the worldly pleasures
[1:05:11] he says now when they got down to Jordan
[1:05:13] time to cross over
[1:05:18] maybe some of us are
[1:05:37] you know I I don't know what's happening
[1:05:40] but they're making me preach more often
[1:05:42] you know
[1:05:45] I feel like I'm still falling behind
[1:05:48] um
[1:05:49] because my pastor is way over there
[1:05:55] and I'm way back here
[1:05:59] am I the only one yeah I'm fine being
[1:06:02] the only one
[1:06:03] God works perfect with everyone
[1:06:07] well maybe this night is time to cross
[1:06:10] over
[1:06:13] he says then when he crossed over he
[1:06:16] said
[1:06:17] the stage of the Holy Ghost Church
[1:06:22] and now I want to ask you something
[1:06:28] so what do you want okay
[1:06:31] Elijah asking Elisha Elias
[1:06:36] maybe Jesus telling the church
[1:06:40] maybe God asking you now
[1:06:45] so what do I want
[1:06:47] what do you want remember you're the
[1:06:51] church
[1:06:52] and it says Elisha it is
[1:06:59] Jesus
[1:07:12] I hope somebody understood that yo is
[1:07:15] there's a scripture that says Greater
[1:07:18] Works ye shall do yeah
[1:07:21] so if Elijah is a type of Christ
[1:07:26] how much should the bride put forth
[1:07:31] if she's asking for a double portion
[1:07:36] Elijah did eight Miracles
[1:07:50] because he asked for a double portion
[1:07:54] now be careful what you asked foreign
[1:08:07] that was a hard thing
[1:08:10] well there's nothing impossible with God
[1:08:15] there's nothing hard with God
[1:08:20] continue saying yeah
[1:08:24] he said that a double portion of your
[1:08:27] spirit come upon me
[1:08:31] it's like if he was asking for more rain
[1:08:37] for more problems right
[1:08:40] sometimes when you ask God for something
[1:08:43] it gives you problems
[1:08:46] but those problems aren't to be
[1:08:48] discouraged
[1:08:51] those problems are to bring out what you
[1:08:54] ask God
[1:08:57] the devil just tricks
[1:09:01] but we have to know how God works us
[1:09:06] don't be scared
[1:09:10] as for the whole lot
[1:09:15] Jesus said you have not because you
[1:09:19] believe ask not you ask not because you
[1:09:22] believe not he said nothing is
[1:09:24] [Music]
[1:09:25] no
[1:09:27] pedis
[1:09:29] ask abundantly that your Joys may be
[1:09:32] full okay
[1:10:33] foreign
[1:10:42] [Music]
[1:11:17] glory to God Gloria Dios
[1:11:23] something about Elisha I'll go daily
[1:11:26] sale is that he was a one-eyed man
[1:11:33] Chester he only had one eye solament
[1:11:38] just one spiritual life
[1:11:43] is
[1:11:47] many times we're with our eyes were
[1:11:50] looking in different ways okay there was
[1:11:53] no Saga on
[1:11:54] that God would make us a man of one eye
[1:11:59] foreign
[1:12:09] because the thing of it is
[1:12:13] that if you saw him leave no no but but
[1:12:17] if if not then it wouldn't be so that's
[1:12:19] the catch and this is
[1:12:26] and that's why I read all those ten
[1:12:29] verses
[1:12:32] Elisha over and over
[1:12:36] I won't leave you
[1:12:39] I won't leave you I won't leave
[1:12:43] oh Brothers
[1:12:47] when my pastor tells me to preach again
[1:12:49] and again and again
[1:12:56] I won't leave you
[1:12:58] I won't leave you
[1:13:01] this flesh wants to it's here but the
[1:13:05] guard that is in me
[1:13:07] [Music]
[1:13:09] I would like to switch your view a
[1:13:12] little uh
[1:13:14] so Genesis 19.
[1:13:19] verse 25
[1:13:24] Genesis 19 verse 25.
[1:13:31] this is the story of law exiting Sodom
[1:13:34] and Gomorrah is
[1:13:39] and verse 25 says
[1:13:43] and he overthrew those cities and all
[1:13:46] the plain and all the inhabitants of the
[1:13:48] cities and that which grew upon the
[1:13:51] ground is
[1:14:00] for his wife look back from behind him
[1:14:03] and she became a pillar of Saul is
[1:14:14] all right at to some point that's why
[1:14:17] I've had the Revelation
[1:14:20] Revelation she was falling orders yes
[1:14:24] but she did not keep her eyes
[1:14:29] set forward
[1:14:33] and this was a consequence
[1:14:36] maybe it won't happen today
[1:14:40] but remember that natural is a type of
[1:14:42] the spiritual record
[1:14:45] I don't want to be looking at two
[1:14:49] different Revelations
[1:14:54] there's only one true one
[1:14:58] the rest are dogmas ideas
[1:15:04] but there's only one revelation of Jesus
[1:15:06] Christ
[1:15:10] and that is the one we're falling from
[1:15:12] our Elijah yes
[1:15:15] see so don't look back
[1:15:19] as our brothers are saying
[1:15:23] now I'm just repeating
[1:15:26] I'll be closing now the musicians
[1:15:30] don't look back where you came out
[1:15:35] amen amen don't look back and say I
[1:15:38] could have done better
[1:15:42] don't look back and say I regret it
[1:15:46] everything is for a lesson
[1:15:50] and it's all for you to trust God yes
[1:15:55] it's all for you
[1:15:57] for your life
[1:16:01] there's only life forward
[1:16:05] this is what brother Branham says
[1:16:09] notice when they got across he said now
[1:16:12] you've asked a hard thing but
[1:16:13] nevertheless if you see me go you'll
[1:16:16] have it
[1:16:19] um read that psalm 34.
[1:16:23] okay okay
[1:16:33] now he says here could you imagine a
[1:16:36] single-eyed man
[1:16:38] um
[1:16:40] that's the trouble with Christians
[1:16:43] tonight
[1:16:45] that's the problem with Isaac tonight
[1:16:49] he has his eye
[1:16:55] one of my eyes is on Christ
[1:16:58] and one of my eyes is in the world
[1:17:02] and that's the reason I'm not getting
[1:17:05] anywhere
[1:17:11] because I'm not looking straight
[1:17:16] maybe that's why we haven't gone to this
[1:17:18] church yet
[1:17:22] it's on its way but maybe we could have
[1:17:25] had it sooner
[1:17:29] they got their eye one of them on Christ
[1:17:32] and one in the world
[1:17:35] I can see Elisha watching him
[1:17:46] that's the only way he ever was going to
[1:17:48] get the blessing is when he catch
[1:17:51] watched him foreign
[1:18:34] I like to read Psalm 16.
[1:18:39] this is
[1:18:41] says I have set the lord always before
[1:18:44] me
[1:18:47] because he is at my right hand
[1:18:51] I shall not be moved
[1:18:55] if you set your eyes always on God
[1:19:02] you will never be moved
[1:19:06] you will never be moved
[1:19:10] you know pray with your eyes set on God
[1:19:15] not on your difficulty
[1:19:19] that's the problem many times
[1:19:23] I'm praying thinking about the problems
[1:19:27] but I'm not praying how God will deliver
[1:19:29] me
[1:19:32] pray with your eyes set on God
[1:19:38] fear only God
[1:19:40] because the fear of God
[1:19:44] will always keep you
[1:19:46] from fearing anything else
[1:19:50] only fear God Brothers
[1:19:58] don't fear cancer
[1:20:00] don't fear anything Brothers
[1:20:03] fear only God
[1:20:06] the more you trust Jesus
[1:20:09] and keep your eyes focused on it
[1:20:12] the more life you will have must be the
[1:20:15] vowel open your life
[1:20:18] your spiritual life
[1:20:21] because I feel like I'm dying now every
[1:20:23] service
[1:20:26] for trusting God
[1:20:28] and you'll have more lives
[1:20:33] will bring you rest
[1:21:00] let's not play God anymore
[1:21:04] let's not play God anymore
[1:21:10] parado
[1:22:01] then I don't know what God you served
[1:22:03] again because God doesn't stop
[1:22:08] and my pastor doesn't stop
[1:22:11] that means the Sheep don't stop
[1:22:15] God bless you
