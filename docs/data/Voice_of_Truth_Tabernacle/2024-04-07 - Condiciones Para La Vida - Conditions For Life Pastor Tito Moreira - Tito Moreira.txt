TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] he [Music] h [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] he [Music] f [Music] my head I said I don't understand this and these young women throwing their arms around me now I do realize this is a mixed audience and I say this with the sweetness and the mellowness of the spirit men cannot put your arm around women without a human sensation but it wasn't there there was no yesterday no tomorrow they didn't get married or tired I never seen such pretty women in all my life they had their way down to their way their had their Hairway down to their waistline long skirts to their feet and they were just just a hugging me as you see brother Brown begins to speak about this place I take it like the perfect place the perfect atmosphere but Brown says there was no weariness pain or anything of this and I begin to see this like something letting me know there was life here the life of the Lord Jesus Christ was there there was no religion there was the life of God why what conditions were there we see the prophet is describing these women look many many times women don't notice how much of what they do means to the Holy Spirit they don't notice that trimming your hair dressing indecently are conditions for death and not conditions for life people would say the temperature must be exact details matter if you bring your body temperature down two degrees if you drop it from 95 and below your body begins to die your body cannot sustain life your body is always fighting to keep the right temperature because they know it needs that temperature to keep life so that life does not Escape it's time we notice that life is escaping from us I'm not speaking about natural life but the spiritual life you should say do I really have God's life in me you should ask yourself why is the life escaping from me have you ever F you're dying spiritually dying come on church it's time we realize why what conditions are around us you think trimming your hair and dressing indecently doesn't matter it might not matter to somebody but they are part of God's laws you say how do you know that brother Titus because I see it here in heaven they all had long hair they all were dressed appropriately the conditions what was needed people make these things less like if they don't matter but let me tell if certain conditions conditions are not in their place life cannot come you say God doesn't care about what I watch What atmosphere do you have around you God forgives you God forgives you not only did God give us conditions for life God provided us a way to make it to those conditions I don't know if you understand what I'm saying he himself says I will carry you there I can wash you I can fix you I can help you so the life can come in you but we don't want to we don't let him Brethren I don't know if this hurts us or if it's making us fall asleep but this hurts me cuz I find out if I want the Holy Spirit if I want God's true life I need the correct conditions around my life you say why does all that matter because it matters to God that you're genuine to wear makeup dress a certain way God wants the beauty from the inside of you come out not the beauty of this world everything that women wear today are worldly things the world has created them that was not God God wants sincereness God wants honesty God doesn't want something fake over you That Matters to the Holy Spirit they are conditions for life now I'm speaking as a church when a woman because a woman represents the church when a church is woring more to please the people out there to and press programs everything else there cannot be life there that's why God left the organizations there can't be life there brother brandom says as as soon as a church organizes death comes in and life leaves life can't dwell there say Lord forgive us maybe we haven't created the right atmosphere we come to church like a religion brother we don't come with a Thanksgiving we don't come with the right motives oh Hallelujah Lord no wonder the Holy Ghost can't pour himself no wonder they can't be new births brother brandham says this at the end and I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me that was in the room said this is what you preach was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it I see then the main condition is not the only one but the main condition that should exist you understand what I mean when I say condition right I'm speaking about a certain atmosphere that needs to form talking about certain requirements things that must be in order the first one is divine love just like there's a sun for Earth just like the sun needs to shine without the sun there's no [Music] life if there ain't a sun nothing can be born that's the first thing God said let there be light and there was light and brother says and the clouds were separated and the sun shined and began to produce life from these seeds Brethren without love there is no life I'll repeat it without love there is no life forgive me you can be the best religious person know the message but without love you continue being a grave the first condition for life is love the most important that should exist for Life Is Love Brethren and what are we doing we judge criticize gossip and block the love that should be between us how can the Holy Spirit move oh Church how can the holy spirit moves when the right love between us is missing I'll tell you one more time if the conditions aren't there you won't be in the resurrection there will never be life in you what you have right now ain't life it's death it's a life that little by little is fading like a body that cannot maintain life maybe it's bleeding out you have an ill body a cancerous body a bleeding out body you can call it life but it's dying the life is leaving little by little that's what we have today don't call this life we are dying by the minute life that was once in the Garden of Eden little by little has been leaving and has produced sickness sin everything else and urgently we need to return to the right conditions for life to come inside us God is giving us an opportunity oh Church God's giving you an opportunity Christian God's giving you an opportunity for New Life to come in you before you completely die God says I'm giving you a chance before death takes you before there's no solution for you I'm giving you an opportunity for life to come again in you the life Adam had the life the Lord Jesus Christ had the life that was here in this sixth Dimension we need the correct conditions we need the correct atmosphere are you with me those that are farmers in agriculture you know you cannot s out of before time because they die won't produce anything when it's you need to know when the right time for producing is you need to se when the time is right for so life can come out and when the conditions are in place life comes life is produced one more time that's why God sent us a message to prepare a bride so she could have the correct womb just like the spirit Mary had behold behold your servants let it be done according to thy will it wasn't the natural God wanted God wanted the spiritual Mary he wanted the correct had the correct Spirit she had she had the right atmosphere she had the right atmosphere had the correct word and God sent us the correct word I believe this message has come to give us the right atmosphere the right conditions for the life of the Lord Jesus Christ could come one more time but uh to produce life you need the egg and sperm you need male and female are with me and this time God sent us the Original Seed need a bride in the correct atmosphere that has a correct womb to produce what he sent in our time what will it produce it will produce the Resurrection The Rapture will produce the coming of the Lord when the conditions in The Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ are how they should be don't wait for the world to improve the world will get worse when Sarah gave birth to the promised son God was about to destroy Sodom and but they were ready they were ready to produce the promised son don't wait for the world to get better need to be in the right atmosphere we need the original faith can speak about all the things this message did of things it did it turned the bride the church returned her to her young State returned her to her original state to her original Faith that's what this message did before we could produce the Lord Jesus Christ he had to return this bride to his original love to its original faith it's his original Revelation what did it do it rejuvenated of the Lord Jesus Christ so her womb could be ready brother I don't know if you understand what I'm telling you Sarah's womb had to be ready couldn't produce it in that condition God had to change her and in this time God has to change the bride to her original Faith to her original fa so her womb could receive God's word he took us to the original Faith his faith or your faith is not enough it has to be the original Faith I'll repeat it your faith is not enough to produce life you need the original Faith Brom tells in the message only believe talking about gyus is he says that gyrus was a secret believer and there he was you know out there and believing then come home by little candle light and study though the through the night when he'd go to one of those meetings maybe disguised himself and put a veil over his face or something so he wouldn't be known as Dr gyrus you know he wouldn't want to be known amongst the crowd but yeah he was sitting there he's telling that gyrus this man maybe wore a disguise put a hat on or something a scarf and he would attend the Lord's meetings he would sit way back there and would write notes but he didn't want them to to know he was there and he watched this and he studied it but yeah he couldn't openly publicly confess him because he'd have to give up his Ministerial Association and his fellowship with his brethren well you know God's got a way of bringing that real genuine Faith out in us oh hallelujah hallelujah Brethren brother BR and so his little girl got ill what was God doing he was setting the correct to bring out gyrus genuine Fai he had a mediocre fath a faith of a secret believer I ask myself I ask myself how many of us have a halfway Faith with God we have a halfway Faith with God but God knows how to bring it out from us all of a sudden his daughter it was not a coincidence was not a coincidence it was God working in his son to bring out the genuine Faith out of him he had no other option he had no other option when he found out his daughter was dying listen brethren when he noticed or realized his daughter was dying that's our problem we don't realize we're dying we haven't realized because we're in church we think we're fine watch what prophet saying on gyrus brother Brown says after he met with his religious friends and they told him they said remember if you go you know what's going to happen you know our declaration yes I understand all about it but I've got a dying child here and the very thing that I've hid in my heart all the time I've searched the scriptures I've attended to his meetings under disguised and I've checked the scriptures and he is the Messiah amen that's it amen that's the way you're coming to it Jus come right out and tell them what's right confess your Fai church we need to confess our faith which faith the faith God sent us a prophet it's time to stand for it oh he said the truth said now you remember if you do well what's going to happen but jyrus had a need and brother if there was a time that we ought to make our confession that he is the Messiah the Son of God that he is alive that his power is just the same there's a need today today is the hour people are dying people are dying in churches ohos oh brother there might not be a pain in you till it's your son or daughter maybe until it's your your own self soul and you realize my soul is dying I need of the life maybe that's why we haven't hurried we haven't interested and we have that's why we haven't taken this message serious because we haven't realized that we might be dying spiritually we might not be in the resurrection your all your religion might not save you all your Creeds might not save you Church time to recog if there's no life in us if the right love is in if the correct faith is not in us we will not attend that will not be there won't be there people are dying in churches the Pentecostal church is dying it's going so formal it's getting out of the way from God if there's any time to step out and say we are dying let's get back to God it's right now because there's a need come back to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints that's the faith that produces the correct you say why don't I have what's correct because the correct conditions aren't there correct will produce what's correct the correct love will produce the life of God your ideas religion won't help you are you listening Church your religion won't help you life can only come when you are in agreement with God when you are in accord with his laws you say God doesn't care how I dress he loves you he forgives you but you'll never have life you'll never be born again that way listen to me you won't be born again unless the conditions are the correct ones you need to forgive you need to love let go of the things of this world as long as the things of this world are there you will never have life you won't be in the resurrection let all stand the musicians can come we don't like hearing the word of God we don't like hearing the message that has the right atmosphere we spend time hearing all types of things on YouTube and everything else but hear the prophet and build the right atmosphere you need to know how to preserve the right atmosphere for Life to Come the right atmosphere needs to be preserved needs to be preserved doesn't come from night to morning doesn't come just because you came and felt something you need to preserve the right atmosphere Lord surround me with your do make a Shadow over my life life just like you did in Mary's womb we want to hear a little of the prophet and think we're well our heart is not well our mind isn't well you need to say Lord Here Am wash me wash my atmosphere clean my mind clean my
