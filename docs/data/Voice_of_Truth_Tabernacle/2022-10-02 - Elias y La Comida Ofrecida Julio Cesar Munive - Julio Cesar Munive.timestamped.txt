[29:11] Christ
[29:17] the lord allows us to be in his house
[29:25] I know we've had a wonderful time
[29:31] visiting our brothers
[29:37] honoring the precious couple that renew
[29:39] their vows
[29:41] we had a tremendous celebration
[30:15] [Music]
[30:31] we can be ready
[30:50] and we'll be reading in Matthew 24.

[31:01] uh
[31:03] from verse 27 to 28 amen amen
[31:08] um
[31:10] I would like to ask you

[31:19] that you have in Fort Collins
[31:23] it's very good to hear that
[31:25] says
[31:29] sorry I'm removing my glasses I don't
[31:32] understand
[31:34] now to read I need to take them off
[31:37] I think it should be backwards okay
[31:41] forgive me
[31:44] the prophet of God says when a pastor is
[31:46] satisfied
[31:48] and the people are satisfied
[31:52] that makes a good church
[31:56] and then God is satisfied
[32:01] and I believe to see you all together
[32:03] satisfied especially
[32:07] especially the message we're carrying on
[32:13] El Pueblo I believe that it shows a
[32:16] continuity with the people and the
[32:18] message
[32:19] once again
[32:22] foreign
[33:23] so likewise see when you shall see all
[33:26] these things know that it is near even

[33:41] fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass
[33:43] away

[33:56] but of that day in our noeth no man no
[33:59] not the angels of heaven but my father
[34:01] only
[34:02] but as the days of Noah were so shall
[34:05] also the coming of the son of man be
[34:07] coming
[34:16] for us in the days I were before the
[34:18] flood they were eating and drinking
[34:20] marrying and giving and marriage until
[34:21] the day of Noah entered into the ark
[34:25] is
[34:30] new not until the floor came and took
[34:32] them all away so shall also the coming
[34:34] of the son of man be let us pray

[38:18] I'm here
[38:21] to see if you do anything with it
[38:25] I can't do anything for you
[38:28] unless you want it
[38:31] unless you desire

[47:10] going down of the Sun that afternoon the
[47:12] angel of the Lord appear here in the
[47:13] United States at that time when you see
[47:15] the Fig Tree and the rest of these trees
[47:17] putting forth

[47:35] flag is the oldest yeah
[47:38] uh bordos Mill años masqueso and it's
[47:43] been Lane Dorman for two thousand years
[47:46] about 2500 the Jewish flag
[47:51] that six-point star of Davido
[47:56] never flowed for 2500 years
[48:00] since the carrying away of Babylon
[48:04] and now because the Roman Empire took
[48:06] them over
[48:07] and the Messiah comes
[48:10] and they rejected it they said
[48:14] and they were scattered to the four wins
[48:17] of the years
[48:20] but did you know on May 6 1947
[48:25] that flag come back over Jerusalem

[48:35] next day

[48:56] the same day foreign
[49:26] [Applause]
[50:36] let me tell you something
[50:42] [Applause]
[50:45] we're still waiting for our Revival
[50:55] now God brought us out if we recognize
[51:03] 1946.
[51:06] now his commission was in
[51:36] love her
[51:44] how tremendous right
[51:50] anything like this man lived
[51:54] have you made mistakes
[51:57] I've made thousands
[52:01] made one mistake
[52:04] and it caused the death of his wife and
[52:08] his daughter
[52:11] his wife told him that was our mistake
[52:14] to listen to our mother
[53:16] we can't do it alone foreign
[54:19] just leave them that way and let's go
[54:23] right
[54:30] but we were offered a food
[54:34] Elijah and the uh
[54:37] but one day God called them
[54:40] then he come out
[54:48] when he come out what did God
[54:52] he sent him to a widow woman
[54:57] she once had a Manpower over here
[55:07] so she could believe the prophet's word
[55:11] foreign
[55:30] [Applause]
[55:52] [Applause]
[56:19] God fed him there
[56:21] is so here's this woman
[56:25] her husband had passed
[56:28] [Applause]
[56:30] but it took death to set her free okay
[56:33] [Applause]
[56:39] let me tell you something brother
[56:43] God will do whatever he has
[56:45] if you're predestinated
[56:54] a member from your family he won't do it
[56:59] because he wants you look for life
[57:06] I believe they're the scripture
[57:09] that says
[57:13] or daughter or son
[57:15] for my sake not sick it's not worthy of
[57:19] me
[57:20] sometimes eminence
[58:13] what comes first
[58:19] yeah
[58:23] she had a husband that guided her this
[58:25] way and that way
[58:27] and one of the schools down there
[58:31] then it says
[58:40] she was no more hooked to any
[58:42] organization
[58:45] so she was ready now to hear the word of
[58:48] the Lord a woman meaning the church
[58:53] that her husband the organization died
[59:01] and she was just barely thinking she's
[59:03] living herself
[59:06] and God said go down to her now
[59:09] she'll hear you
[59:11] I've commanded her
[59:15] tremendous
[59:22] divorce ourselves from our first husband
[59:25] we have to kill him
[59:29] fornication
[59:45] but now I tell you that I slay you today
[59:53] first husband
[59:58] that you can marry me
[1:00:01] Jesus Christ the word
[1:00:03] [Applause]

[1:09:04] when God sends forth a message and tells
[1:09:07] the people
[1:09:08] receiving and they don't receive it
