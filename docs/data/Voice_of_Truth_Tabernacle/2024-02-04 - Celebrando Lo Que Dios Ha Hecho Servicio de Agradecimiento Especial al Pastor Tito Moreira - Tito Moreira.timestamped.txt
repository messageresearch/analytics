[18:09] words from our brother Marcos
[18:15] Sanchez God bless you
[18:18] Brothers we're happy with
[18:22] God and I believe the feast keeps on
[18:27] going
[18:30] they just gave me some few
[18:33] minutes to express some words to our
[18:39] pastor and we've walked together some
[18:41] time
[18:45] now it comes to
[18:54] mind and I was recalling when the Lord
[18:56] brought us to Colorado
[18:58] [Music]
[19:00] I believe we were
[19:05] crazy because we didn't know where we
[19:07] would get to or come
[19:09] to no work no
[19:13] church we didn't have any
[19:19] idea but I believe we came by
[19:23] faith and they asked a few
[19:27] times if he would move to a different
[19:30] [Music]
[19:32] state and I believe I'd had to fast and
[19:35] pray a
[19:37] lot and above all the the consideration
[19:39] of the
[19:42] pastor because coming here to
[19:46] Colorado that's what we did we
[19:48] fasted we
[19:51] prayed and I believe our Lord showed our
[19:55] pastor this was the place for us
[20:00] and many
[20:01] Souls have been
[20:04] reached I would like to thank our
[20:07] pastor and say thank
[20:13] you because it was only
[20:16] God to be able to leave a
[20:21] place and I believe many of you left
[20:24] family good paying
[20:27] jobs
[20:29] and everything for
[20:32] God and I feel up until now God has
[20:34] blessed
[20:37] us and we have all been privileged
[20:39] because of
[20:41] that I'm thankful with
[20:44] God for placing our brother
[20:48] Tito I believe it's God in
[20:51] him and there's no doubt any single one
[20:53] of
[20:54] us that God is in in
[20:57] him thank you brother
[21:00] Titus and thank you to
[21:04] sister brother BR says behind a good man
[21:06] is a good
[21:08] woman and I would like to congratulate
[21:11] him once
[21:14] again I know he's a little bit younger
[21:16] than
[21:17] me but I have learned a lot from
[21:22] him things from many errors I have I
[21:27] made
[21:29] and now I I give you the advice to go

[40:00] [Music]
[40:03] service we're going to be speaking in
[40:06] five
[40:08] minutes says how B when he the spirit of
[40:11] Truth is
[40:14] come brother brandham uses the scripture
[40:16] in a message a
[40:21] guide and I'm going to refer to
[40:25] it
[40:27] truly what a guide we
[40:31] have our guide is the holy spirit amen
[40:35] amen how many can say
[40:38] amen he is our
[40:43] guide brother Bram says it over and
[40:47] over doesn't matter how tremendous you
[40:55] are was a tremendous student or
[41:01] teacher but when it was about receiving
[41:03] the Holy
[41:05] Spirit have a new
[41:07] birth he needed a
[41:11] guide so it doesn't matter how
[41:13] tremendous we are how good people we
[41:17] are when it's about the New
[41:19] Birth you need a
[41:23] guide God for his guide
[41:28] brother Bram says about
[41:30] Cornelius have you read about Cornelius
[41:32] in the
[41:35] script Cornelius he was a great
[41:38] man honorable
[41:40] man
[41:45] churches he respected the
[41:49] Jews because he know his that their
[41:52] religion was
[41:54] right and he paid
[41:57] arms and he prayed every
[42:01] day but when the Holy Ghost come listen
[42:06] brother something had been added to the
[42:10] church he needed a
[42:15] guide and listen God sent him the Holy
[42:22] Ghost he sent it in the person of Peter
[42:25] Hallelujah
[42:28] he sends the Holy
[42:29] Spirit through a
[42:34] man God works in the same
[42:37] way that's why I thank
[42:40] God that God has placed here a
[42:44] man like our pastor that I believe with
[42:48] all of my heart that he is a
[42:52] man with the Holy
[42:54] Ghost the hlyh ghost dwells in
[42:57] him and he is the
[43:00] guide it's not brother
[43:02] Titus it's not the
[43:05] flesh but what's inside
[43:08] him says he sent the holy
[43:12] spirit to guide
[43:15] Cornelius and sent him to Peter sent it
[43:19] through Peter does it say like that or
[43:24] not he used because he sent Cornelius to
[43:27] the
[43:34] right for while Peter yet spake these
[43:37] words the Holy Ghost fell on
[43:44] him then he said can a man forbid water
[43:47] that these should not be
[43:49] baptized
[43:53] see still the guide speaking
[43:57] not
[44:02] Peter because that was a bunch of Jew or
[44:04] Gentiles unclean dirty to
[44:08] him and he didn't want to
[44:11] go but the guide
[44:14] said I'm sending you Hallelujah God
[44:17] bless
[44:19] [Applause]
[44:25] you
[44:29] um if you'd open your Bibles to 2
[44:31] Corinthians chapter
[44:35] 4:8 I will be reading from 8 to uh 10
[44:39] real
[44:42] uh it says like this says we are
[44:45] troubled on every side yet not
[44:49] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[44:53] despair are persecuted but not forsaken
[44:57] cast down but not
[45:01] destroyed I read I'll continue always
[45:04] bearing about the Bo in the body the
[45:06] dying of the Lord
[45:10] Jesus that the life also of Jesus might
[45:13] be made manifest in our
[45:17] body uh you know this is Paul
[45:22] here you know I believe that every
[45:24] Christian uh um feels this way at one
[45:27] time or
[45:32] another and uh you know when uh I think
[45:35] of our pastor a lot of
[45:37] times uh you know how many times he must
[45:40] not feel like
[45:43] this uh but uh you know Paul was a very
[45:46] uh unique
[45:48] man because Paul was a very unique
[45:53] vessel and I believe that you know our
[45:55] pastor Pastor is is very unique in many
[45:59] ways and uh there's a something there
[46:03] was something about
[46:05] Paul uh you know Paul was he had a he
[46:08] had many many
[46:11] stripes uh you know in the
[46:14] Army the more stripes you
[46:17] have the higher in rank you
[46:21] are and uh you know so Paul Paul was he
[46:25] he he he uh he got many stripes on
[46:30] him uh but what I'm getting
[46:33] to is
[46:35] this is that you know the higher in rank
[46:38] you
[46:40] go you know I believe the the lonlier it
[46:45] gets uh but you know Paul you know no
[46:48] matter how high or how great the
[46:49] Revelation
[46:53] was he was always amongst the people
[46:55] people
[46:57] amen he never thought he was better than
[47:01] anybody and you know I believe our
[47:03] pastor you know reflects the same
[47:05] [Music]
[47:06] thing you know but we know it's Jesus
[47:08] Christ
[47:09] amen we know it's Jesus Christ through a
[47:13] vessel it's Jesus Christ through a
[47:16] man you know as a as we when I was at
[47:19] his party uh you know at his birthday
[47:21] party the other
[47:22] [Music]
[47:23] day I I I approached uh the the table of
[47:26] honors uh and of the accolades the
[47:29] accomplishments that he's that he's had
[47:30] throughout his
[47:35] life and uh and I just I was just
[47:38] reading some of the
[47:41] Articles and uh the ones that I
[47:44] read I don't think there was a single
[47:47] one where he didn't where he didn't
[47:49] mention uh you know God in in in in what
[47:52] he
[47:54] said
[47:56] it was always you know thank
[47:58] God it was always my
[48:01] God and and you know and it was just I I
[48:04] was looking at
[48:05] that you know how at such a young
[48:08] age uh you know he just completely
[48:11] trusted in
[48:12] God you know he's I believe he's been a
[48:15] Marked
[48:17] Man he he he's been he's been marked by
[48:20] God since the
[48:22] beginning and uh you know when when but
[48:25] you know he hasn't stopped the
[48:28] accomplishments haven't stopped
[48:31] amen because the awards you know the
[48:36] honors you know they were all given by
[48:40] man but he hasn't
[48:43] stopped because he still keeps
[48:45] accomplishing
[48:46] things not because he's waiting for
[48:49] something
[48:51] greater he's waiting for something
[48:53] more he's fighting for the the same
[48:57] crown that Paul was fighting
[49:00] for an Incorruptible
[49:03] Crown you know and I as I was
[49:06] thinking you know our pastor I was
[49:09] listening to uh you know Sister
[49:11] Raina and she was talking about how you
[49:14] know the Lord or how you know their mom
[49:16] abandoned them when they were
[49:19] younger you know that must have been a
[49:21] hard
[49:24] thing
[49:26] but one thing I can
[49:27] say one thing I can see through his
[49:31] life is that God never left
[49:34] you God was always with
[49:37] you and you haven't
[49:39] stopped because because we don't stop
[49:42] here we keep going for more we keep
[49:46] going for
[49:48] greater strive every
[49:50] day and he's pulling the
[49:54] cart we should be pulling with
[49:57] him God bless
[50:00] [Applause]
[50:05] you for the Holy Ghost give him a
[50:07] stronger clap offering glory to
[50:11] [Applause]
[50:14] God going to read quick John
[50:17] 1011 and John
[50:19] 1513 I'm the Good
[50:23] Shepherd the Good Shepherd gives his
[50:25] life for the
[50:26] Sheep verse 13
[50:30] says greater love has none one than
[50:35] this that a man lay down his life for
[50:38] his
[50:39] friends what a tremendous
[50:41] scripture I chose
[50:44] it because brother Titus is this for
[50:48] me my thought is not just any friend we
[50:52] don't have just any friend we have been
[50:55] blessed
[50:56] bless you have been
[51:01] blessed when the Lord Jesus Christ
[51:03] allowed him to be your friend now we
[51:06] don't have just any friend in the
[51:10] flesh maybe our brother Titus can fail
[51:14] but spiritually it's
[51:16] different when a friend fails
[51:18] you sometimes they fail you in the
[51:21] flesh but the Holy Spirit comes and
[51:24] pricks
[51:26] tells you go and fix with your friend
[51:29] because with that
[51:30] friend you are in this race and you're
[51:34] going to Eternity with that
[51:36] friend Amen
[51:40] brother when I think about a
[51:43] friend I think about Jonathan and David
[51:47] what great friends were they what great
[51:50] friends what a friend was Jonathan for
[51:53] David that even Jonathan's father wanted
[51:55] to kill him wanted to destroy him he
[51:58] threw a spear at him and wanted to kill
[52:01] David but
[52:03] Jonathan was there as a good friend not
[52:07] any
[52:08] friend because there are many that call
[52:10] themselves
[52:13] friends But when reality
[52:16] squeezes when you need a
[52:19] friend there you need a good friend not
[52:22] any friend you need the holy spirit in
[52:26] flesh in human flesh that can lift you
[52:32] up that's how the Holy Spirit
[52:34] dwells the holy spirit in human
[52:38] flesh brother Bram
[52:45] says his love did it his love paid for
[52:47] my sin his love took them
[52:53] away love is the most powerful force
[52:56] that
[52:57] exists and that's what our pastor
[52:59] shows don't get
[53:02] scared there's a lot of people that can
[53:04] get
[53:04] scared they can say oh they're boasting
[53:07] up the
[53:10] pastor oh let me let me boast him
[53:14] up I'm just gonna boast him more brother
[53:18] brother gar
[53:20] said people get
[53:24] afraid
[53:26] because brother Victor made a song for
[53:28] brother
[53:30] enri but how can they
[53:33] singara oh how much for us to a son
[53:37] filled with the Holy Spirit support him
[53:40] stand next not see the
[53:44] mistakes brother blessed be the name of
[53:46] the
[53:50] Lord take a husband that truly loves a
[53:53] wife and he will die
[53:56] for
[53:59] her without any
[54:04] price and Brotherly
[54:13] Love brother brandham speaks of a
[54:15] certain man he says a man certain man
[54:16] who comes to this church time to time
[54:19] lives in the
[54:22] country he was sitting at his brother's
[54:24] house the other day and asked
[54:28] him what if something happened to
[54:30] brother Bill and he
[54:33] answered with great
[54:35] pleasure I would put my chest to receive
[54:39] the
[54:40] bullet Jonathan just like
[54:43] Jonathan put his
[54:46] chest to receive the spear that they
[54:49] threw at David for his friend
[54:53] davidan and jonath
[54:58] was a
[54:59] type the Holy
[55:02] Spirit and brother
[55:04] Titus he's a type of the holy spirit in
[55:08] human flesh God bless you
[55:13] [Applause]
[55:19] Pastor God bless you brother Jeremiah
[55:24] 3:15
[55:29] and I will give you pastors according to
[55:31] mine heart which shall feed you with
[55:32] knowledge and
[55:36] understanding the shoes of
[55:38] pastors and we begin like this if I was
[55:42] a pastor everything would be different
[55:45] if I was a pastor everything would be
[55:48] well I would do many changes if I were
[55:52] Pastor we'd be greater
[55:55] if I was
[55:56] Pastor I'd make less
[55:59] mistakes I'd know how to behave if I was
[56:02] a
[56:03] pastor everything would be peace and
[56:05] calm if I was a pastor if I was if I was
[56:10] if I was if I
[56:12] was and if I was is
[56:15] there but then this is the question why
[56:18] aren't you Pastor why are you not pastor
[56:22] and the answer is maybe
[56:28] God the ones that stay in their own
[56:30] thoughts aren't good for
[56:32] him the ones that feel that they can do
[56:34] it by
[56:36] themselves or they feel capable by their
[56:38] own but God God chooses those
[56:43] men that are according to his heart and
[56:47] Draw N to God with a humble heart with a
[56:51] humbled heart and beg
[56:55] here in my
[56:57] Lord let it be done to thy
[57:01] will and are
[57:03] willing to what God orders
[57:06] them in a
[57:08] distance the shoes of the
[57:11] pastor they look
[57:18] attractive but better said
[57:21] many there's many people that want to
[57:23] walk in those shoes
[57:27] but when you try to put them
[57:30] on they fit too big because to be a
[57:34] pastor is not only a
[57:37] title to be a genuine servant to God to
[57:41] be a genuine servant to the
[57:43] people it means to be prepared to
[57:46] serve at any time any place anywhere to
[57:49] be a
[57:51] pastor is to go the extra mile
[57:56] to have your mind made up to give
[57:58] everything for the rest to be a pastor
[58:01] many times it's to laugh many times is
[58:04] to
[58:05] enjoy many times is to be joyful but
[58:09] it's also crying being a
[58:15] pastor is to give counsel to the
[58:18] people it's a love and live for the
[58:20] people and feel for the people and not
[58:23] judge the people
[58:26] many want the pastor's
[58:29] shoes but many but few are willing to
[58:32] pay the
[58:34] price the value of the
[58:37] shoes of the
[58:40] pastor are not in the in how shiny they
[58:44] are are not in how much they
[58:47] shine it's not in how joyful they
[58:51] are but the true value of those shoes is
[58:55] how worn out they
[58:57] are is the color that has been
[59:00] fading are those scrapes and
[59:04] scratches of bending your knee of going
[59:07] the extra mile of walking and walking
[59:11] and give everything for your
[59:14] people the true price of the shoes of
[59:16] the
[59:17] pastor that's value our
[59:20] pastor and fight alongside him shoulder
[59:23] Tosh shoulder
[59:25] let's stand up for
[59:28] him brother Bram says in
[59:32] Q&A he refers to our brother
[59:36] Neville and he tells our beloved brother
[59:41] Neville here father he's laboring
[59:47] along a Shepherd here in the pasture
[59:49] field that's trying to lead the Sheep to
[59:51] the Green
[59:52] Grass and the Deep clover
[59:57] or out into the
[1:00:02] water and then back to the shade tree
[1:00:05] and caring for the sick and the needy
[1:00:07] and the little crippled ones and those
[1:00:08] that are
[1:00:15] weary and try to doctor them up and
[1:00:18] bring
[1:00:19] them so they'll be real
[1:00:22] sheep I believe we have a great pastor
[1:00:25] P God has blessed us with a great
[1:00:29] man and I believe God dwells in him God
[1:00:32] bless
[1:00:34] [Applause]
[1:00:36] you God bless you
[1:00:41] Brothers uh Luke 15
[1:00:44] verse4 it says like
[1:00:53] this
[1:00:58] what man of you having 100 sheep if he
[1:00:59] lose one of them does not leave the 90
[1:01:01] and n90 the Wilderness and go after that

[1:05:18] Jesus he says I believe the church
[1:05:21] nowadays when I say a church

[1:05:30] one
[1:05:32] church family for 50
[1:05:36] years asked me to join the family
[1:05:39] why I was born

[1:06:26] uh Luke 1227 you don't have to look for
[1:06:31] it the first first words say

[1:06:41] grow Song of
[1:06:47] Solomon as the Lily among the
[1:06:50] [Applause]
[1:06:53] thorns before the Lily give it its
[1:06:55] Radiance and its
[1:06:59] Aroma I want you to notice the Lord
[1:07:02] wants us to pay
[1:07:04] attention not so much in the beauty
[1:07:06] because but the Lily is
[1:07:11] beautiful focus on the process of its
[1:07:15] growth not so much on its
[1:07:17] beauty that's why it's saying I want you
[1:07:21] to observe To Be watchful
[1:07:25] how the lies are how they
[1:07:28] grow because the Lily has a growth
[1:07:32] process the Lily is not like the
[1:07:37] mushroom night and in
[1:07:40] the they die the following
[1:07:43] day the mushroom doesn't last very long
[1:07:46] it lasts very
[1:07:48] little but the Lily endures longer
[1:07:51] because the Lily goes through a process
[1:07:56] is born in the valley in the

[1:13:41] gift every perfect gift descends from

[1:15:43] less my wife well I've gotten old

[1:33:26] arrived here to Colorado um but one of
[1:33:30] the things that I U really struggled
[1:33:32] with was uh believing in myself and um
[1:33:36] one of the things that you did uh that
[1:33:38] you helped me with was uh you uh told me
[1:33:41] uh to believe in me because God believed
[1:33:43] in me and not only uh did uh you have me

[2:01:19] [Applause]
[2:01:29] we've gotten to the last part of the
[2:01:34] service I was thinking about a few words
[2:01:36] to say to our
[2:01:37] [Music]
[2:01:39] pastor and I I saw where he was born in
[2:01:42] Salas I looked in various
[2:01:45] places but God said no you won't say
[2:01:48] anything
[2:01:51] the one that will say it will be brother
[2:01:55] Garcia so we have some words forcia for
[2:01:58] our
[2:02:07] [Music]
[2:02:17] pastor right now I'm refering to the
[2:02:22] young but right now I'm refering to the
[2:02:25] young they have to take care of
[2:02:28] themselves so then they can then take
[2:02:30] care of their
[2:02:32] family so then if time did
[2:02:37] ter I believe it's possible we may be
[2:02:40] here a few more number of
[2:02:43] years and the young people will be the
[2:02:45] future
[2:02:47] minister
[2:02:50] future teachers evangelists pastors
[2:02:52] Apostles so
[2:02:54] forth they have to take care
[2:02:57] of and they have to get ready to prepare
[2:03:00] themselves so that when that day
[2:03:03] comes that there's a better
[2:03:06] job that you can fulfill that
[2:03:10] job Titus
[2:03:16] 17 this
[2:03:17] preaching
[2:03:19] he preached it in
[2:03:23] 1984 it's been almost 40
[2:03:26] years for all of you that know our
[2:03:30] pastor he knows he we know he doesn't
[2:03:33] like to be the center of
[2:03:36] Attraction even this service was not was
[2:03:39] not going to be
[2:03:43] undertaken just so you know the kind of
[2:03:45] Pastor you
[2:03:47] have but Hebrews 13:7
[2:03:51] says says remember uh your your
[2:03:56] pastors which have rule over you who
[2:03:58] spoken unto you the word of
[2:04:01] God whose uh Faith
[2:04:04] follow considering the end of their
[2:04:08] conversation so remembering our
[2:04:13] pastor and maybe probably that many of
[2:04:17] us could not agree in many
[2:04:21] things but I believe we're in agreeance
[2:04:23] in one
[2:04:24] thing that we love our
[2:04:27] pastor how many love your pastor amen
[2:04:30] [Applause]
[2:04:45] amen and because we love
[2:04:47] him
[2:04:49] we want to give him a small
[2:04:51] gift the whole church got
[2:04:54] together we all uh got into one Accord
[2:04:59] and we want to give him
[2:05:02] something Pastor coulde please come
[2:05:06] [Applause]

[2:05:24] [Applause]
[2:05:25] graas herto thank you brother

[2:05:42] God for you that you are our
[2:05:47] pastor
[2:05:49] if the children could
[2:05:53] come from all the church we uh and the
[2:05:56] chap
[2:05:57] fold the brothers Froman are are missing
[2:06:00] here we want to give you this this gift
[2:06:03] on behalf of the church in
[2:06:17] God
[2:06:23] I I wanted to uh just break free from
[2:06:27] this God bless you you may be
[2:06:31] seated if your desire was to encourage
[2:06:34] me I believe you have achieved it amen
[2:06:37] gracias gracias
[2:06:40] [Applause]
[2:06:47] graas
[2:06:52] you guys commit
[2:06:59] [Music]
[2:07:04] me truly I don't I didn't believe it was
[2:07:06] a good idea to make one of these
[2:07:07] services for
[2:07:09] me for you that know me you know I don't
[2:07:12] like
[2:07:13] it I I feel
[2:07:16] uncomfortable I like to do more for
[2:07:18] others than for
[2:07:19] myself it brings me more
[2:07:22] joy to do something for somebody
[2:07:25] else then you have then you do it for me
[2:07:29] but I
[2:07:31] believe that all of the
[2:07:33] pastors and all of the Servants of
[2:07:37] God we need a little bit of
[2:07:41] encouragement we need someone to tell
[2:07:44] us it's it's worth it what you are doing
[2:07:48] yes
[2:07:52] thank you
[2:07:54] Brothers thank you for those those
[2:07:59] Praises for the words that the ministers
[2:08:02] gave for the
[2:08:05] videos for thinking about
[2:08:09] me I don't deserve
[2:08:13] it I believe that all glory should
[2:08:15] always be to
[2:08:17] God like our brother Edward
[2:08:21] said many times you have to say yes to
[2:08:26] God many times we have to say it's
[2:08:29] that's it's fine
[2:08:35] Lord since I can remember I've been
[2:08:37] serving the
[2:08:47] lord and I remember remember the reason
[2:08:49] the voice of two Tabernacle was was
[2:08:54] born was because I spent two years
[2:08:57] weeping to the
[2:09:00] Lord saying Lord what is it you want me
[2:09:02] to
[2:09:07] do it were years when I didn't know what
[2:09:09] to
[2:09:11] do and I
[2:09:13] remember praying to
[2:09:16] God saying Lord what is it would have me
[2:09:18] to
[2:09:19] do he
[2:09:23] said to to to move to
[2:09:27] Watsonville and help my
[2:09:34] father I still spent I still spent one
[2:09:37] year trying to to convince myself that
[2:09:38] it wasn't God's
[2:09:41] will but he kept telling me that's what
[2:09:44] he
[2:09:47] wanted
[2:09:49] and I moved to a little
[2:09:52] garage the services were taken were took
[2:09:55] place in a
[2:09:58] garage sometimes I would just preach to
[2:10:00] my
[2:10:07] brothers but I've always done it with
[2:10:09] all my
[2:10:13] heart brother Edward
[2:10:17] came
[2:10:21] brother
[2:10:22] Willam brother
[2:10:27] Marsh there was various people of not
[2:10:29] I'm going to get into
[2:10:32] problems I don't mention brother Miguel
[2:10:38] everybody when they began to arrive
[2:10:44] so after I
[2:10:47] moved
[2:10:52] God told me to begin Voice of Truth
[2:10:58] Tabernacle it was just simply the our
[2:11:01] family
[2:11:03] there and he told me to establish the
[2:11:08] church lay down a good
[2:11:13] foundation I registered
[2:11:17] it
[2:11:19] normally people pay thousands to
[2:11:20] register Church through a
[2:11:23] lawyer and God helped
[2:11:25] me to do everything that needed to be
[2:11:29] done to legalize Voice of Truth
[2:11:35] Tabernacle when it was just two three
[2:11:37] four
[2:11:41] people and God told me to do it
[2:11:46] right what you do do it right
[2:11:51] churches and
[2:11:52] groups they don't even know what happens
[2:11:54] with the
[2:11:57] offerings there's no
[2:12:01] regist begin from the beginning he told
[2:12:03] me to do
[2:12:06] right that enters the registers that
[2:12:09] there would be a
[2:12:11] system everything would be done
[2:12:17] right and and that is the the
[2:12:19] theme of of my
[2:12:23] life is that if you're going to do
[2:12:25] it do it right if you're GNA
[2:12:29] preach even if there two or three on the
[2:12:31] bench do it right prepare
[2:12:35] yourself give the best of
[2:12:39] yourself and that's what I've done for
[2:12:41] those you that have been
[2:12:43] there in that garage it was my
[2:12:47] father's
[2:12:51] s's
[2:12:54] [Music]
[2:12:57] house I would always tell
[2:13:00] them the
[2:13:02] group it's not how many we
[2:13:05] are it doesn't have anything to do with
[2:13:07] how many there is Let's Be
[2:13:10] Happy let's love
[2:13:13] God and that the Holy Ghost would be
[2:13:15] amongst us that's what matters
[2:13:20] the quantity has never mattered to
[2:13:23] me I don't see an ed advantage in
[2:13:28] quantities I seen
[2:13:31] Advantage when we love each other with
[2:13:33] our heart because I
[2:13:37] believe that since I come from a broken
[2:13:40] such a broken
[2:13:41] family there's always been a desire in
[2:13:43] my
[2:13:44] heart to have a true
[2:13:46] family
[2:13:51] and God gave it to
[2:13:54] me God fulfills his
[2:13:56] promises
[2:13:58] um one
[2:14:05] time we have R rented a small place
[2:14:08] there in
[2:14:14] Watsonville now I always had to do the
[2:14:17] harder thing
[2:14:24] put up the
[2:14:25] projector play the
[2:14:28] guitar and then song
[2:14:30] Lead
[2:14:33] preach and sometimes we had
[2:14:36] Gatherings if if if it's something we
[2:14:40] had even if it's just a little bit that
[2:14:43] people like to come visit
[2:14:45] us so I was going to have a small guest
[2:14:49] I don't remember who was going to visit
[2:14:53] us and I was complaining a little bit to
[2:14:56] the
[2:15:02] Lord I feel
[2:15:07] tired it seems like nobody
[2:15:16] helps This truly what you want me to do
[2:15:19] or what is
[2:15:22] it and God
[2:15:25] said when I tell you God told me God
[2:15:28] told
[2:15:31] me I don't say God told me just to say
[2:15:34] it God told
[2:15:37] me what if I called you for
[2:15:40] this just simply to
[2:15:45] work and like I've always done
[2:15:49] God always defeats
[2:15:51] me I said that's fine
[2:15:54] Lord if this is what I'm going to do
[2:15:56] this is what I'm going to
[2:15:58] do as long as it's what you
[2:16:06] want when he told me to move from
[2:16:12] California that was very
[2:16:16] difficult but God showed
[2:16:20] us he gave us he gave us some great
[2:16:25] signs and I still
[2:16:29] remember when the truck of quite a few
[2:16:32] families was
[2:16:34] full the biggest truck I could get from
[2:16:39] Pensky I had never driven such a a big
[2:16:43] vehicle I was so scared to drive that
[2:16:46] thing
[2:16:56] um but I remember seeing those that we
[2:16:59] were dismissed from that
[2:17:01] day I didn't know who was going to
[2:17:05] move I just knew that that's what God
[2:17:07] had asked me to
[2:17:11] do my heart was
[2:17:16] weeping said Lord I'm gonna have to move
[2:17:19] again I don't know if I'm going to see
[2:17:20] them again I don't know if I'm going to
[2:17:21] see them
[2:17:31] again and the Lord told me I'm going to
[2:17:33] give you all the ones that came to your
[2:17:38] ministry and he was
[2:17:42] faithful many
[2:17:45] times my life
[2:17:48] I've had to make
[2:17:53] decisions that I don't understand
[2:17:58] them but I know when God tells me
[2:18:04] something and I've tried as best I could
[2:18:06] to be
[2:18:10] obedient just be
[2:18:15] obedient even though I don't understand
[2:18:23] and the reason I'm
[2:18:25] obedient it's because he's always been
[2:18:28] faithful because I believe
[2:18:30] him I believe in a mighty
[2:18:39] God the last talk I had with California
[2:18:43] when I from
[2:18:44] California I I told them
[2:18:48] if I see you again or or
[2:18:52] not just know that I've believed in
[2:18:56] God that I believe that I believe that
[2:18:58] there's a real
[2:19:01] God just know that there is a real
[2:19:05] God I believe in that
[2:19:13] God I didn't know what God had in the
[2:19:15] next 40 years
[2:19:19] I believe 40 years is very
[2:19:26] significant we're not celebrating
[2:19:27] brother
[2:19:29] Tito at least that's the way I see
[2:19:32] it we're celebrating what God has
[2:19:35] done I believe God has done a
[2:19:38] lot and he can do a
[2:19:41] lot when somebody surrenders to
[2:19:45] him somebody is simply obedient
[2:20:04] um come
[2:20:07] years where I just simply want to
[2:20:12] relax simply just say well
[2:20:15] Lord but the random says that
[2:20:21] or the story of the
[2:20:24] eag
[2:20:26] where where times come where the wings
[2:20:29] get a little
[2:20:31] tired your eyes
[2:20:35] begin begin to fail
[2:20:44] you the beak doesn't grab hold of the
[2:20:47] food
[2:20:53] right and there's been moments where I
[2:20:55] felt that
[2:21:03] way you know I Was preparing for the my
[2:21:06] 40th year
[2:21:09] year I felt something in my heart to
[2:21:12] prepare for
[2:21:16] it
[2:21:18] because I've seen that the number 40 is
[2:21:20] very significant in the
[2:21:23] Bible 4 days 40
[2:21:27] nights 40 years 80
[2:21:31] years
[2:21:34] Moses etc
[2:21:40] etc so in on this trip to
[2:21:46] Colombia I decided to spend as much time
[2:21:48] as I could with
[2:21:51] God because it's
[2:21:55] different here you're always dealing
[2:21:57] with the
[2:22:00] situations sometimes you go out and like
[2:22:05] oh I need to fill my cup
[2:22:07] again I need you to help
[2:22:11] me I was telling the brother I'm not
[2:22:13] going to go
[2:22:16] eat
[2:22:18] the youth had activities I would go to
[2:22:20] my
[2:22:22] room I I I wept a lot in
[2:22:26] prayer I said
[2:22:29] Lord I I believe I need to make another
[2:22:32] decision like the
[2:22:36] eagle make another
[2:22:40] decision what will I do with what is
[2:22:46] left
[2:22:49] because after after I wept I went to the
[2:22:53] mirror I looked at
[2:22:58] myself I said are you gonna do
[2:23:01] it are you gonna make the right
[2:23:08] decision I said yes
[2:23:12] Lord you're all I
[2:23:16] have you're the greatest thing I
[2:23:22] have I want to serve you for the rest of
[2:23:24] my
[2:23:27] life I want to give the best of
[2:23:39] myself I want to give more for
[2:23:44] you because I believe that I'm not the
[2:23:46] only one that's broken
[2:23:49] here I believe we need one
[2:23:55] another I've never wanted to do it
[2:23:59] alone I've always wanted a family to do
[2:24:02] it with
[2:24:05] me the Walk of a pastor gets very
[2:24:12] lonely unless you're a pastor there's a
[2:24:14] lot of things you won't understand
[2:24:23] that sometimes you have to take many
[2:24:25] blows or hits for
[2:24:34] others it seems like you have to be
[2:24:36] willing
[2:24:37] to or
[2:24:40] things
[2:24:43] but that they would tell you that you're
[2:24:45] this or that
[2:24:53] um and then have nobody to share your
[2:24:56] pain
[2:25:03] with
[2:25:07] but we have one
[2:25:11] [Music]
[2:25:14] another I don't desire to be
[2:25:18] alone I desire to do this with
[2:25:21] you I desire to make it to eternity
[2:25:26] together so my desire is to do the best
[2:25:29] for
[2:25:31] you I believe that if we are willing for
[2:25:38] God we will loose more of
[2:25:43] God we will loosen more of God's power
[2:25:47] we will see more of God's
[2:25:50] wonders we serve an almighty
[2:25:54] God and if there's somebody that stands
[2:25:56] for
[2:25:57] him he will stand for God will stand for
[2:26:01] them if we stand for
[2:26:04] God God will stand for
[2:26:07] us if if as bad as we have
[2:26:11] been God has blessed us so
[2:26:13] much he has blessed us so much
[2:26:18] how much more if we stand more for
[2:26:20] him let's stand for him
[2:26:22] Church let's stand for one
[2:26:25] another if you want to stand up for
[2:26:28] God stand up for your
[2:26:32] brother anybody can do it anybody could
[2:26:35] be a Christian
[2:26:38] alone it takes a true son or daughter of
[2:26:43] God sinful people people that have
[2:26:45] errors
[2:26:48] people that fail
[2:26:49] [Music]
[2:26:51] daily say God if this is your people I'm
[2:26:54] gonna stand for
[2:26:58] them so let's stand for
[2:27:02] God and God will stand for
[2:27:06] us on Friday I said my birthday I
[2:27:10] said I feel like a blessed
[2:27:15] man not because I have materialistic
[2:27:20] things because I truly don't have a
[2:27:22] whole
[2:27:23] lot I have more debt than
[2:27:31] anything don't have cars to boast
[2:27:35] about house or this or
[2:27:40] that but I feel a blessed
[2:27:43] man first of all because I have him
[2:27:50] because I have an almighty
[2:27:52] God that humbled himself so
[2:27:56] much that he was willing to be my friend
[2:28:00] and walk with
[2:28:01] me with someone like
[2:28:04] me that's why I feel
[2:28:07] blessed I feel blessed because of
