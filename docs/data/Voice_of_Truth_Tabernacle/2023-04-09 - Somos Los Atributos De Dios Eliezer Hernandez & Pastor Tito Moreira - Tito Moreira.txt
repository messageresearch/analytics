DC and it reads is in the end of the Sabbath as it began to Dawn toward the first day of the week Came Mary Magdalene and the other married to see the Sepulcher is and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the Stone from the door and sat upon it is countenance was like lightning and his Raymond white as snow and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men and the angel answered incident to the woman fear naive for I know that you seek Jesus which was crucified he is not here for he has risen as he said come see the place where the Lord lays we'll continue reading more let us bow our heads to receive your word I started to be willing to pay attention for what you have for us it is your word we have titled our message we are God's attributes we are God's attributes could you repeat with me it's not a Sunday school but I want to make sure I want to make sure that you repeat that repeat what I am saying the attributes of God with them doesn't matter how great the storm is just how his disciples Jesus Christ was with them and everything was well sometimes we're found that way for a while Jesus Christ has been with us I'm not gonna calm the storm this time that's how it happened with the disciples three and a half years he spent with them all of a sudden they learned but even Jesus Christ these three and a half years he prepared them for that moment they were still blinded to them had to show his actions so he went to the cross that some disciples nombre you can put my name there you can put your own name there they began to deny him they weren't as close to him they couldn't touch him he couldn't hear his voice anymore they couldn't touch him they didn't feel his presence and they began to to stray away if you see brother angel came to the Sepulcher when this Angel descended were afraid they were afraid and they ran how my father used to say why do I want my legs let's run let's go because they were not prepared they weren't prepared and here what what happened but there was a small group a very small group of so many millions only Jesus Christ came to a very few Anton says before a tough situation the human being normal normally is what's normal it's the reflex of the human being but the angel told the woman tranquilas relax assistant Don't Be Afraid don't be afraid because this is for you entices verse 7 says and go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into Galilee there shall you see him lo I have told you I I know there are discrepancies in the gospels some don't mention exactly how it happened they just give you a little tease some uh change it for you some say one thing happened before the other thing as our brothers told us this morning so the first one he appeared was to Mary Magdalene where it says it's better if we all read it because I may be mistaken you can be mistaken but God's word is not mistaken pulco the first day of the week come with Mary Magdalene Ernie early when it was dark until the circle currency the stone taken away from the Sepulcher again in this scene here I see three believerses verse 2 says then she runeth and coming to Simon Peter and to the other disciples and there was three there remember God needs Witnesses be in every business foreign out of the Sepulcher and we know not where they have laid him foreign did outrun Peter and came first to the sepulch the other one was more excited than Peter since Peter denied the Lord Jesus Christ I see Peter backsliding you know when the Lord Jesus Christ resurrected Plus already one of his disciples had committed suicide Place Judas and Peter parallel person I know brother puts Jesus and Judas parallel but Judas didn't give himself the opportunity I know I want you to understand this I know he was the son of perdition but he didn't give himself the opportunity for God to forgive him you know many times we are about to commit spiritual suicide I can see Peter she is if the Lord Jesus Christ didn't come arise from the sephorus sooner he would end the same as Judas you know I spoke with some brethren you know this is and I would say have you noticed uh there's some brothers that used to come to church and they don't come anymore and sometimes you see them in the grocery store and they're kind of hiding from you it's not that one is living a better life but there's a guilt are you not are you are you there's a burden of Shame and sometimes we cannot remove that from ourselves and that's what Jude is Judas could not take that burden off and didn't give himself the chance and sometimes we don't give the opportunity to him that has fallen we're the ones that went to uh tell him of the situation he was in the members of his church and they accused him of secret sin it is brother Branham says they were mistaken God was testing job amen cuando uh four of John 20. closed line yet when he not in he was the first disciple he got there he looked around didn't say anything and left so Peter coming looked around me can say watch no no both of them didn't see anything Peter looked and left the other disciples returned that other disciple which came first to the Sepulcher and he saw and believed this disciple didn't have to see him all he did was seen and believed and it doesn't say Peter had his doubts that's how we are sometimes because sometimes we prove that there's doubt in us that's why the Lord Jesus Christ came to prove something but sometimes we're proving that we're doubtfulness knew not the scripture that he must Rise Again from the dead without at the Sepulcher weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the circle and see two angels in White City because she was waiting and the promise Los Angeles and see two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the fee where the body of Jesus had Lanes and said unto her woman why weep is thou is she said unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him Jesus says Jesus said unto her okay she's supposing him to be the gardener situations thou has borne him since tell me where thou has laid him and I will take him away Jesus said unto her Mary when the Lord Jesus Christ begins to call out in the resurrection he will call them by name says how long will the resurrection I don't know I just know that he's calling and I will rise so we see what had happened really happened Anton says the Lord Jesus Christ found two men walking towards Emmaus Jesus never told him go to Emmaus she just told him stay still stay still oh see God's glory there were two on their way and Jesus found them and open their eyes they had to return Locos sometimes we don't say God and count will take off we see a Revival there and there we're headed when that Revival isn't for us God has everything we need here that was doubting sus Amigos maybe his friends sus Hermanos Brothers he's alive and he said Not until I see the holes in history then I'll believe the Lord Jesus Christ Sir Thomas why are you that way Thomas why are you there why don't you believe your brothers why Thomas I need do I have to come again from the circle and show myself again to you a El Sayo de Pasqua program says in the Easter seal you know paragraph 31. no second English this is our purpose to prove his word the truth there was only one man that could do that yes and that was Jesus and he come and proved that to be the truth is all the superstitions of other religions where gray man has rise man has raised up and said great marvelous things but for everyone in the grave religion Christiana for our Christian religion is the only one who has an empty tomb yes and that proves to me the god of the living is proved through the years why did he return But as God God bless you brother [Applause] let's read in the Book of Job what a tremendous word how many love him so our brothers we wish them a happy Easter [Music] joy to celebrate alongside with them and every one of you our sister Vicky and her family we wish her a happy Easter Job 38 the end we know the scripture very well chapters 38 verse 4. this is where was that when I laid the foundations of the earth declare of thou has to understand measures thereof if thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it says we're upon are the foundations or fasting or who lays the Cornerstone thereof on when the morning star sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy now to speak of this Easter I want to return that was in heaven you know there was an Eastern Heaven the Bible says that the lamb was before the first Easter was celebrated it was celebrated in heaven it was a celebration when God wrote the names celebrating what he had done for us because it's good I believe there's people that shout September 16. this is our Victory this is our Victory Day so wake up on an Easter morning and not be able to shout she is risen fear [Applause] [Applause] the first history was celebrated before the foundation of the world there we shouted there we gave our Victory shouts well brother Branham says that God was alone he was Elohim the self-sufficient but inside him there were attributes inside his mind there was iron there was you they were in thoughts like ours there were attributes God doesn't have thoughts like we do in his mind thoughts don't change about to manifest of the Lord Jesus Christ but he was in the form of God and in the form of government he manifested angels and he became God now you would think because we're speaking about a vision and you were thinking well that's the maximum that's what the devil desires Satan's greatest Vision was to become God that's what he desires he said that if I succeed to be gone he fought everything lost everything because he wanted to be God nevertheless when God became God when Elohim became God he had not yet displayed all his attributes God became God because before having worshipers and he said how can I become more than God how are we sometimes very short we're very short-minded and say the day that I have all I want God had everything he wanted and simple the message God hiding in simplicity of course I'm gonna skip a little ahead foreign I'm going to read in the message God's provided a way of approach to fellowship and I wonder about that then if we go back to the beginning all things begin in Genesis and in Genesis we find out that God creative man for his fellowships God loves to come down and to fellowship with his people I'm going to skip a little more Dios foreign see here see this here when God was God Los Angeles when he formed Angels he was barely starting so fulfill everything that was inside and him was the attribute of a father Yes or yes he could not display and he said so that I can become more than God this blows my mind for me to be greater than a God I'm gonna become a man so that I can become more now God hiding in simplicity these elements NL uh um at that time Jesus answered and said I think Theo father Lord of Heaven on Earth these things from the wise even so Father for they seemed good and I saw it these are these are basically uh you know God is so great he hides himself in Simplicity and then he reveals himself in the same thing he hides God is so great he can make himself simple yes that's what makes him great to God it was the most wisest plan that anyone could have thought of [Music] that they have not even [Music] stand your brother receive this is foreign let go of ourselves serving a form of a servant the Bible to be more than a God he took the form of a servant [Music] oh Lord Jesus now watch here Jesus when Jesus came as a man foreign foreign Jesus thank you I said no one tell he was the life Resurrection the resurrection is the attribute of God manifested when the attribute of God was manifested when the attribute of God was manifested no one can deny anymore that he is a savior and shined on the seeds underwater all they needed was the Rays of the sun to shine all right and that's what Jesus Christ did when he resurrected the life came out this that action figures came out he resurrected from the deadline all questions any questions before Abraham sorry Abraham I am goodness says you're not even 50 years old he said oh Hallelujah doesn't believe very well yeah it's in simplicity [Music] oh hello simplicity foreign have you noticed to her [Music] there's people that aren't them calling try to come out [Music] it's like if you go through from a natural Dimension to a spiritual Dimension have you ever felt it okay have you found that you're tired weary you're discouraged seems like everything is a lie it doesn't only happen to you sometimes yeah all of us you know that God is real there's no doubt in you yes what is this God's attribute and the moment disappointed in the next moment you are saying and so I say so [Applause] yes what is it it's God's attributes and simplicity is the devil can't decipher it is foreign what manifested that attribute Jesus what manifested there with Jesus the Resurrection The Resurrection prove without a doubt who he was where he came from and who he was no one could question because only God can lay his life and retake his life no Prophet could do that only god with only his presence the attribute inside him what about us now what about us sooner or later we have to manifest who we are sooner or later for God's attributes or not musicians can come sooner or later all right can I tell you something step out of your flesh foreign make contact with him that's eternal if you are God's seeds you have a piece of Eternity inside you you have a gene of God in you lay aside your mistakes put all your flaws aside and make contact for a moment that that is eternal inside there's something telling you that you're not foreign again [Applause] time is coming we must manifestation all we need is for the sun to shine on us all we need is for the sun to shine on us who's that is there's something telling you that you're more than only a good citizen a good religious I'll go there's something that tells you because you came to manifest a part of God [Music] you say brother Titus how then same mind be in you 've been in the form of God robbery to be his God thought it not robbery to be God but he made himself of no reputation and took upon the form of a servantes and was made in the likeness of men yes and being found in fashionism he humbled himself and became obedient unto death de Cruz even the death of the cross just so there'd be only one he died and resurrected to give every one of us so wake up the seed of life that is inside us well you have to humble yourself also look brethren you want to display your purpose be humble [Music] be humble become a Mr no one yes Lord help me understand my brothers I want to understand my brother's condition why do I want everyone to be as I did Pastor why do we want everyone to be like us when you're not so happy the way you are sincere we're not happy we want everyone else to be this unhappy Instead try to understand them you have to stoop down to their level try to say Lord but God was willing [Music] what about you what about me we're not willing to open our hearts because I'm good and it's not true we're not good that way why don't you decide and this morning I'm gonna be Morgan someone religious someone bitter I'm gonna be more than just why not give God the chance to transform you foreign I'm not religious if God was willing to change for you can to you who am I so say I'm gonna stay the same way oh Lord don't allow me man change my mind change my heart a more clean up a greater mind you know yes thinking these last days my heart has been getting cold this is sometimes if they don't do it with me why would I do it with them sometimes you so give yourself and all that happens is you're left wounded foreign [Music] [Music] good afternoon yeah it is I was meditating sometimes my heart is getting cold and hardened um and you say you give so much for the people and you're only left wounded [Music] but God told me just to wear this I was willing to give everything from myself without not waiting anything in this conversation I told God you're so good you give to us even when we give you the worst medicine and God says you need to be different you need to be different you have to be willing to change your ways I say Church [Music] we must have La capacidad the capacity [Music] the capacity to change [Music] the capacity to be different the capacity is to say I will do it differently I tried it this way and I'm still not happy God told me he told me if you do that the only one that is spoiled is you I want to bless you I want to give you more but if you do that the only one that is spoiled is you yeah and I say Lord help me be different help me be how I used to be important well it didn't matter who I gave it or what they did give me brother not being sincere with you like me you have to give it all right you have to be willing to change your way I don't know how you are so yes maybe you say I'm this way I'm this I'm that why not give God an opportunity do something different foreign [Music] the same to understand my brothers have mercy on them so be the doormat of the church so God can manifest in my life [Music] this is the moment the sun shine on that seed make contacts with that part inside of you that is not human that is of god just for a moment make contact remember who you are remember who you are God wants to manifestos [Music] and this morning while we say He Is Risen why don't you remember where was thou um when all the morning Stars sang together and said I will go Lord and said I will go to sleep I will manifest your attributes I will manifest I'm from eternity Hermanos
