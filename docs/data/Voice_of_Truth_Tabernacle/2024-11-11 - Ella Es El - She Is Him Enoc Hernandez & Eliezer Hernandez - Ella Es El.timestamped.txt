[30:21] father I present it before
[30:24] you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:27] amen amen
[30:31] if you can open your Bible with me
[30:34] inis Genesis
[30:37] 24 verse
[30:46] 2 I want to take the story of Abraham
[30:49] sending his servant
[30:53] eleazer to find a bride for his son
[30:59] we're in the same subject going deeper
[31:01] with
[31:05] God you want to know how to get closer
[31:08] to
[31:10] him how how we can get to know him
[31:17] more how we can love God more than our
[31:25] capability or what is he expecting from
[31:28] every one of
[31:29] us it reads like
[31:41] this oh yeah no I started with the one
[31:44] myad Genesis 24:1 and Abraham said unto
[31:48] his eldest servant of his house that
[31:51] ruled all that he had put I pray thee
[31:54] that thy hand under thy my thigh
[32:09] [Music]
[32:20] and I will make the SW by the Lord the
[32:21] god of Heaven and the god of the earth
[32:23] that thou shalt not take a wife unto my
[32:25] son of the daughters of the Canaanites
[32:27] among whom I
[32:33] dwell but thou shal go into my country
[32:35] and to my Kindred and take wife unto my
[32:38] son
[32:48] Isaac and the servant said unto him
[32:50] pre-venture the woman will not be
[32:52] willing to follow me unto this land must
[32:54] I needs bring thy son again unto the
[32:57] land from when thou
[33:02] camest and Abraham said unto him beware
[33:04] thou that thou bring not my son thither
[33:25] again the Lord God Of Heaven which took
[33:27] me from my father's house and from the
[33:29] land of my Kindred and which spake unto
[33:31] me and that swear unto me saying unto
[33:35] thy seed will I give this land he shall
[33:37] send his Angel before thee and thou
[33:39] shalt take a wife unto my son from
[33:44] then so let's jump to verse
[33:55] 58 and they called Rebecca and said to
[33:58] her Willl thou go with this man and she
[34:00] said I will
[34:02] go you may take your
[34:04] seats you think the
[34:10] musicians here we find a love
[34:13] story but it's not a very common
[34:22] story when you have time at your home
[34:24] please read Genesis 24 to yourself
[34:29] so you can understand all of this
[34:34] story I'm going to try to summarize it a
[34:38] little try to explain it a
[34:44] little and how this story applies to us
[34:47] in our
[34:49] time how it's so
[34:51] parallel so
[34:55] perfect there shouldn't be a doubt in
[35:00] us how it was simply a
[35:05] shadow now here we
[35:10] find that Abraham strick in an
[35:15] age he wants to find a bride for his
[35:21] son it wasn't an easy commandment to put
[35:24] in charge of any person
[35:27] he couldn't do it
[35:31] himself he had to entrust it to
[35:34] somebody of high
[35:37] trust and who
[35:39] better than that
[35:43] person that had control of all his
[35:47] possessions that had proven his
[35:50] faithfulness to
[35:52] him that he had not wasted one
[35:56] cent he had proved to
[35:59] him to be a worthy
[36:06] servant so he commands to
[36:11] this the steward of all his
[36:15] belongings to find a wife for his
[36:22] son now why did he not send just a son
[36:29] doesn't the son know his likes better
[36:31] than anyone
[36:33] else but watch this
[36:39] servant this servant had raised Isaac
[36:42] from a young
[36:44] age he seen him grow from the time he
[36:47] was
[36:49] born he knew him so
[36:54] well that he knew the same likes and
[36:56] dislikes of
[36:58] Isaac and Abraham knew
[37:01] this that's why he had this
[37:05] trust but beyond
[37:08] that Abraham wanted to express to his
[37:12] servant what was inside of Abraham's
[37:15] heart because us as
[37:18] parents sometimes we
[37:23] know that our children can make wrong
[37:26] decisions
[37:29] but the father knows more than the
[37:32] son and tells his
[37:37] servant please find a wife for my
[37:45] son and the servant says what if she
[37:48] doesn't want to
[37:49] come then Abraham tells
[37:52] him worry
[37:56] not the angel of the Lord will go before
[38:02] thee him trusting in the word of his
[38:07] master he begins this
[38:12] task and when he gets to the land of
[38:15] where Abraham is
[38:18] from he kneels to
[38:21] pray and he says
[38:25] Lord show me
[38:35] the bride that will be the wife of my
[38:39] beloved of my master and he asked one
[38:44] thing to he says Lord to the one that I
[38:47] ask
[38:50] water and not only give me
[38:53] water not just me but all of my camels
[38:58] let her
[38:59] be the one you have
[39:03] chosen look he got into
[39:07] prayer and before his prayer was
[39:11] over Rebecca was on her
[39:20] wayca was not the only damsel that came
[39:22] to get water from this well there were
[39:25] many damsels
[39:29] but she waited until the evening
[39:33] time and even
[39:35] elzer sent by the
[39:38] angel he went in the
[39:42] evening he didn't have to choose of
[39:46] many because he had prayed for
[39:52] her and he had not even finished his
[39:56] prayer here Rebecca
[40:01] comes and he simply says woman give me
[40:04] to
[40:06] drink and
[40:08] she being a
[40:12] damsel she did not deny
[40:16] it said yes I will give you to
[40:20] drink and I'll also give your 10 camels
[40:23] to
[40:25] drink and she
[40:31] began to give water to every one of
[40:33] these
[40:36] camels in the
[40:44] message decision a time to make a
[40:47] decision preached uh
[40:51] 1959 look how brother brandham sets this
[40:54] story
[40:59] now Isaac was a type of
[41:03] Christ through Isaac come
[41:07] Christ and then Rebecca was the type of
[41:10] the church did you C that the
[41:16] bride and elzer found Rebecca in the
[41:18] evening
[41:21] time the sign was performed in the
[41:23] evening
[41:25] time that's the time we're living
[41:28] in I trust that you get
[41:34] this it was in the evening time when
[41:36] Rebecca come out led by the
[41:40] spirit do you believe
[41:43] that how otherwise would she have
[41:48] come there might have been many before
[41:54] her but she was led by the spirit in the
[41:57] evening
[42:05] time and eler the messenger the minister
[42:08] the true servant to his master was in
[42:11] the evening
[42:14] time the true servant had left his
[42:16] Creeds in
[42:19] things and made up his mind that he was
[42:21] going to trust
[42:23] God in the evening time
[42:28] we can find in the
[42:30] scripture that the Lord Jesus
[42:33] Christ came to
[42:36] redeem a
[42:39] church he came to his
[42:42] own but his own reject
[42:46] him but unto all that received
[42:51] him gave them power to be made sons of
[42:55] God give them power to be his
[43:00] bride he came to redeem his
[43:05] bride but that wasn't in the evening
[43:10] time A Time had to go
[43:15] by Gentiles time is over the Lord Jesus
[43:18] Christ
[43:19] said then it will be the
[43:22] end in the evening
[43:25] time when the light is dimming
[43:29] out when the earth is in
[43:32] [Applause]
[43:33] darkness then time will be no
[43:38] more watch the times we live
[43:45] in it can't get darker than this
[43:51] Brethren speak with anybody and their
[43:53] mind is
[43:55] confused they don't know who they are
[44:00] themselves they wake up in the morning
[44:02] so
[44:05] worried we are in the evening
[44:08] time and God in a
[44:13] type promised to send a messenger in the
[44:16] evening in the seventh
[44:22] watch he promised to send an
[44:25] elzer to come
[44:28] gather and
[44:30] harvest that
[44:33] [Applause]
[44:34] Pride but
[44:37] she watch in this
[44:39] story the messenger
[44:42] comes and gives Rebecca the
[44:45] message and tells
[44:47] her back
[44:49] there where I come
[44:52] from my
[44:55] master the son of my
[44:58] Master he loves
[45:02] you hold on hold
[45:06] on she never thought he doesn't know me
[45:09] yet how can he love
[45:12] me just the same in our
[45:15] time it's been asked for this
[45:18] bride love him
[45:22] uncondition without seeing him
[45:27] by faith she
[45:30] beli by faith she received this
[45:34] message and as she heard the the more
[45:37] she heard about him he began to tell
[45:44] her everything my master has he will
[45:49] inherit and everything that will be his
[45:52] will be
[45:53] yours Oh it sounded sounded like a fairy
[45:56] tale
[45:58] but she trust in
[46:01] him because she had been led by the Holy
[46:05] Spirit she had also been in
[46:09] prayer and God knew the need in her
[46:13] heart why there was a deep calling
[46:16] another
[46:18] deep it's the same in our evening time
[46:22] breth God had to send a messenger
[46:27] there had to be one person
[46:31] to there had to be that heart willing to
[46:34] trust willing to love
[46:37] him without seeing
[46:43] him why is it so hard for
[46:46] people to see the Lord Jesus
[46:51] Christ if he's already shown all of his
[46:54] GI
[46:56] showed everything he wants for
[47:00] her one of the first things aler
[47:05] did to Adorn her and give her all the
[47:08] gifts that he had brought from his
[47:14] master brother brandham says
[47:30] that's why I believe those that are born
[47:31] again Holy Ghost F people is connected
[47:33] with God and are led by the spirit of
[47:38] God that's why they act so peculiar to
[47:41] the
[47:43] people they've made their
[47:49] decisions
[47:54] says they're going to go on out
[47:56] regardless if the
[47:59] rest they're going anyhow I love
[48:03] that don't care if this one walks or
[48:06] that I'm going to walk
[48:09] anyhow I don't care whether this one or
[48:13] what they
[48:14] say call me anything they want
[48:17] to I'm going
[48:19] anyhow
[48:22] why the life is in the
[48:25] blood and the life is in the the
[48:29] church the Christian that's born again
[48:31] by the spirit of God that's the spirit
[48:34] of
[48:36] Life blood relation to
[48:43] Christ that's what Abraham commanded
[48:47] El don't go find it with the
[48:51] can don't believe in the same God I do
[48:54] look for her
[48:57] from my
[49:03] homeland did you know Rebecca was cousin
[49:06] with
[49:08] Isaac they were blood
[49:13] relatives brother brandham
[49:18] says says that
[49:21] we our blood
[49:25] relatives through the sacrifice he did
[49:27] at the
[49:30] cross that's why we're relatives with
[49:34] him or Kinsman when God made the first
[49:38] he made him
[49:40] Spirit then he came to Earth formed him
[49:44] from the
[49:45] dust and put that spirit in
[49:49] man but when he forms a
[49:52] woman doesn't form her the same way
[49:57] first of all he forms her
[50:01] Earth brings her from the same material
[50:03] God formed man of the of the Earth from
[50:06] clay brings a ribs
[50:09] of and begins to form
[50:12] her and
[50:15] then from the spirit of
[50:18] Adam he pulls out the
[50:21] feminine and deposits in the
[50:25] woman watch the process of this first
[50:29] bride it's the same proc of the last
[50:32] bride of this end
[50:36] time this body that God formed Adam from
[50:39] The D
[50:41] of the Prophet calls it the body of the
[50:46] word but this body needed a to give her
[50:51] life this
[50:54] bride must
[50:57] first of
[50:59] all so that blood can be inside
[51:04] her then he begins to
[51:07] shape through the
[51:10] word and while he shapes her she's he's
[51:14] she's creating Faith
[51:15] virt patience Temperance patience
[51:19] godliness fear God brotherly
[51:22] love and when she's ready
[51:28] she's waiting for
[51:29] that to come and sit and rest upon
[51:33] her she can be ready to go
[51:37] home what brother Bram is saying
[51:40] here she must be of the same
[51:44] material brother
[51:46] never offend your
[51:48] wife she
[51:52] is your
[51:56] the
[51:58] church that gave his life for
[52:01] her she is part of
[52:04] him she is
[52:07] [Applause]
[52:11] him brother brandham
[52:14] says in the
[52:16] message in the evening
[52:21] messenger that's the messenger of the
[52:23] last
[52:24] days the evening light
[52:28] is first find that
[52:31] church where they will believe that
[52:33] message
[52:36] hunted can you read what I'm talking
[52:41] about hunt where that church is that
[52:44] will even let you
[52:46] come that won't close the door in your
[52:50] face and then when you do
[52:54] there you found character
[53:02] now she will stand still long
[53:06] enough to tell her how the bride's got
[53:08] to be
[53:10] dressed she's got to be
[53:14] clothed
[53:16] he what dresses the
[53:19] bride this
[53:22] message she begins to embrace the word
[53:25] of God brother
[53:29] message is nothing different from this
[53:32] Bible is the same thing in
[53:35] this but it had been
[53:37] promised that in the latter
[53:41] days all
[53:44] Revelation would be manifested to the
[53:46] bride to
[53:48] her the only one
[53:51] worthy of the son of his master this
[53:57] he says
[54:00] look at the little Rebecca listening to
[54:02] every
[54:03] word her little heart was
[54:07] beating don't you feel this
[54:09] way while the word is being
[54:13] spoken there's something where you
[54:17] identify when you
[54:19] identify there's nothing else to say
[54:23] but you identify with this word
[54:28] that's how our heart
[54:31] beats he was telling
[54:35] her until you I find the
[54:43] character then when I find the character
[54:45] then make her stand still long enough to

[57:29] together our uh theme this
[57:33] morning she is
[57:36] him she is
[57:38] him and when I say she is him it's this
[57:42] bride the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[57:47] Christ converting into the
[57:51] groom doing the same thing the groom
[57:54] does
[57:56] behaving like the
[57:58] gr now this
[58:00] world doesn't know who it
[58:04] is now she wants to call himself
[58:07] him he wants to call him himself
[58:12] her or she wants to call herself
[58:16] they but can't identify with
[58:20] anything better said they don't want to
[58:22] identify with anything
[58:26] but this bride identifies with the
[58:29] groom this
[58:31] bride does not represent a last
[58:35] name does not represent a
[58:38] country does not represent an
[58:41] idea it represents
[58:45] him that's what she wants to be she
[58:49] wants to be
[58:51] him
[58:54] now so she can be
[58:59] him she needs to receive his
[59:04] messenger now
[59:07] Rebecca had to receive the messenger
[59:11] first the one sent for her in her
[59:15] time to
[59:17] recognize who she
[59:22] was until she received the messenger
[59:27] you know there's something attracting us
[59:28] to the
[59:29] messenger there's
[59:33] something I don't know how to explain it
[59:35] but there's
[59:36] something can someone tell
[59:45] me somebody can tell me there's nothing
[59:47] good to our
[59:50] side to say oh I love this
[59:54] Messenger as a matter of fact for our
[59:57] eyesight our human
[1:00:00] eyesight that vessel is filled with
[1:00:04] mistakes because it's a human
[1:00:07] vessel but it's what he
[1:00:11] represents because he doesn't represent
[1:00:15] himself the message he actually
[1:00:18] brought brought him from his
[1:00:23] master searching for a bride for his son
[1:00:26] his master's
[1:00:28] son so what he
[1:00:30] spoke was not of
[1:00:33] himself he never said fall in love with
[1:00:37] me elzar never told
[1:00:40] Rebecca fall in love with me look how I
[1:00:44] am how great I am
[1:00:47] no pointed to his
[1:00:50] master he pointed to his
[1:00:52] lord it's the same thing today
[1:00:56] for us in our
[1:00:58] day we must
[1:01:01] received our
[1:01:07] messenger and we need to recognize who
[1:01:10] our messenger today
[1:01:14] is you know when elizar found
[1:01:18] Rebecca one of the things that calls my
[1:01:20] attention the
[1:01:22] most that he found her in a well
[1:01:28] you know in the story of the
[1:01:31] Bible all the details
[1:01:34] matter all the details
[1:01:37] matter but when I met my
[1:01:40] wife I remember all the
[1:01:45] details every
[1:01:49] detail I'm not saying I remember the
[1:01:52] exact color of her
[1:01:54] dress but I remember everything
[1:01:56] happening
[1:02:01] around it was like a scene that was
[1:02:03] pre-planned
[1:02:04] a scene that was prepared
[1:02:09] already and I believe that's what we
[1:02:11] come searching this
[1:02:13] morning that's what I come searching for
[1:02:16] to have an encounter with my Lord to be
[1:02:19] closer to my
[1:02:23] Lord I desire to know how I can fall in
[1:02:25] love more with my
[1:02:29] Lord but to find out how I can fall in
[1:02:31] love more with my
[1:02:34] Lord I need to know what he demands of
[1:02:37] me and he
[1:02:39] demanded for
[1:02:42] Rebecca go to the
[1:02:47] well that's where he wanted to
[1:02:52] meet that's where God wants to meet us
[1:02:56] in the
[1:02:58] water
[1:03:00] well I want to tell
[1:03:03] you naturally what the water
[1:03:08] is what does water benefit us uh
[1:03:29] the functions of water in our body are
[1:03:30] multiple the most important are the
[1:03:36] following it allows the transport of
[1:03:38] nutrients to the
[1:03:43] cells it collaborates in the digestive
[1:03:51] process helps us get rid of what we
[1:03:53] don't need
[1:03:59] collaborates in the digestive process in
[1:04:01] breathing and in blood
[1:04:09] circulation it intervenes in the
[1:04:11] contraction of the muscles and gives
[1:04:13] flexibility and elasticity to the
[1:04:19] tissues it participates in the proper
[1:04:21] functioning of the brain and nerves
[1:04:32] it provides essential minerals such as
[1:04:34] calcium magnesium and fluoride which
[1:04:35] serve to strengthen bones and
[1:04:40] teeth it contributes to the regulation
[1:04:43] of body
[1:04:50] temperature it can keep us from being
[1:04:54] lukewarm I know you understand
[1:04:55] understand
[1:04:58] me and it delays the aging
[1:05:02] process
[1:05:05] well not sure if you were able to catch
[1:05:10] this but the Holy Spirit through our
[1:05:14] pastor last
[1:05:19] Sunday spoke about a scripture while he
[1:05:21] was reading
[1:05:27] but we have to pay attention to the
[1:05:29] details when God is speaking to
[1:05:34] us between both scriptures he
[1:05:37] read he said these
[1:05:40] words the words were he
[1:05:46] said everything we have in the spiritual
[1:05:52] realm everything we are or we desire to
[1:05:55] be be in the spiritual
[1:05:58] realm depends on our relationship with
[1:06:02] God all the fruit we're going to
[1:06:06] produce depends on our relationship with
[1:06:11] God if we're not connected with him in a
[1:06:19] relationship we cannot produce the fruit
[1:06:21] we should as
[1:06:24] Christians look for it it's in last
[1:06:26] week's
[1:06:27] preaching it's around the 23rd
[1:06:30] minute giving you the
[1:06:34] details but you know Psalms 1
[1:06:38] says he shall be like a tree
[1:06:41] planted by rivers of
[1:06:45] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[1:06:47] his
[1:06:48] season his Leaf shall not
[1:06:52] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:06:57] prosper shall prosper
[1:07:01] why he's connected to the
[1:07:03] Fountain this
[1:07:06] bride needs to be connected to the
[1:07:09] groom through the
[1:07:19] fountain earnestly contending for the
[1:07:21] faith that was once delivered to the
[1:07:22] Saints preach
[1:07:23] 1953 brother brandham said
[1:07:28] says and the Beautiful Rebecca came out
[1:07:30] and he
[1:07:31] said
[1:07:35] now now ever who Waters this
[1:07:41] camel he said Lord let that be the one
[1:07:44] you've
[1:07:47] chosen and Rebecca went and watered the
[1:07:52] camel and give them a drink
[1:08:00] look the very animal that she was
[1:08:04] watering the animal represents a
[1:08:08] beast of course a of course a beast of
[1:08:15] burden which means power in the
[1:08:19] Bible and the Very animal that she was
[1:08:23] watering was the very
[1:08:27] that packed her to see her
[1:08:30] bride cor is that
[1:08:34] right and what is
[1:08:40] watering the very power we're watering
[1:08:43] now with prais and
[1:08:46] Thanksgiving and glory and power and
[1:08:50] might is a very holy spirit that will
[1:08:54] pack us
[1:08:56] to see Jesus
[1:08:59] [Applause]
[1:09:02] someday what is that power what is this
[1:09:06] water that same Holy Spirit that's why
[1:09:10] this
[1:09:12] bride needs to be at the
[1:09:16] well connected with her
[1:09:19] groom drinking of this
[1:09:22] water drinking of this word
[1:09:26] expecting the
[1:09:34] bridegroom I remember another
[1:09:36] story very similar very
[1:09:41] similar it's the Samaritan
[1:09:45] woman you remember the Samaritan
[1:09:50] woman the Samaritan woman
[1:09:55] was also at the water
[1:09:58] well that's where God wants to meet us
[1:10:01] that's where he wants to meet us and he
[1:10:04] will meet us there he'll meet us in his
[1:10:10] word why does this grp want to meet his
[1:10:15] bride why does he want to meet
[1:10:20] her because she is him
[1:10:27] she is part of
[1:10:29] him he the
[1:10:33] groom it's not complete without
[1:10:37] her
[1:10:39] God is not complete without me I want
[1:10:43] you to repeat that this
[1:10:45] morning repeat it like you believe it
[1:10:50] God is not complete without me
[1:10:56] again again
[1:10:58] God is not complete without
[1:11:03] [Applause]
[1:11:07] me
[1:11:09] now when God found this Samaritan
[1:11:14] woman this Samaritan
[1:11:17] woman was not a ill Fame
[1:11:21] woman she was clearly living in adultery
[1:11:27] but she was always searching for her
[1:11:31] beloved she was always searching for
[1:11:33] someone to
[1:11:34] love and that's how we are
[1:11:37] today that's how we are right now that's
[1:11:40] why we're right here because there's
[1:11:42] something inside us that's crying for
[1:11:45] the groom and says I want to love him I
[1:11:49] want to love him there's something here
[1:11:55] that wants to answer to that
[1:11:58] love and that's how this Samaritan woman
[1:12:02] was here was this smarten
[1:12:05] woman she thought she was doing
[1:12:09] well that she wasn't doing anything
[1:12:14] wrong but she met with the word
[1:12:18] itself
[1:12:20] so the Lord Jesus
[1:12:22] Christ when he got to this well
[1:12:28] the Holy
[1:12:30] Spirit just the same way with
[1:12:34] Rebecca had already been moving and
[1:12:36] prepared the
[1:12:37] situation and if you
[1:12:40] prepared this
[1:12:42] morning the Holy Spirit has something
[1:12:45] for you I'm not sure what it is I don't
[1:12:47] know what it is believe the Holy Spirit
[1:12:51] has something for you because he
[1:12:53] promised
[1:12:55] that he would sent the angel before
[1:12:58] him to prepare the
[1:13:06] way when Jesus arrived he told his
[1:13:10] disciples I must pass through
[1:13:15] Samaria the holy spirit is leading me to
[1:13:21] Samaria you know when Jesus Christ is
[1:13:23] present
[1:13:25] it's easy to
[1:13:28] identify his presence is easily
[1:13:31] identified
[1:13:33] amen and you have to identify with
[1:13:37] him you have to identify with
[1:13:41] him so when the Lord Jesus Christ was
[1:13:44] present with this Samaritan
[1:13:50] woman she knew her intentions in her
[1:13:53] heart
[1:13:55] she knew her own
[1:13:58] Spirit she knew what her need
[1:14:02] was it's the same thing God knows about
[1:14:05] us this
[1:14:07] morning he knows what we have need
[1:14:10] of he knows
[1:14:12] everything you know this
[1:14:18] woman she met with the word
[1:14:23] itself so the first thing the Lord Jesus
[1:14:25] Christ
[1:14:27] did was to contact her
[1:14:31] spirit because very deep where she
[1:14:36] was there was an everlasting
[1:14:40] representation that he had already
[1:14:42] deposited
[1:14:43] there and that same
[1:14:46] representation had to
[1:14:48] meet with another
[1:14:51] representation to make contact
[1:14:57] and he could not do anything else but
[1:14:58] through God's
[1:15:03] word so
[1:15:09] then when she saw who was before her
[1:15:13] look
[1:15:18] Brethren put it this way so you can
[1:15:20] understand me
[1:15:23] better when she found the Lord Jesus
[1:15:27] Christ she was in a different or another
[1:15:32] relationship and that's where God wants
[1:15:35] to find
[1:15:38] us because many of us are not in our
[1:15:40] relationship with
[1:15:42] God we're in a relationship with someone
[1:15:46] else but he wants to find
[1:15:49] us he wants to meet us in his
[1:15:52] word you know this Samaritan woman
[1:15:56] knew about the
[1:15:58] word knew that the Messiah would
[1:16:04] come and would display everything that
[1:16:06] the Messiah would
[1:16:08] do but she had not found him
[1:16:11] yet she would attend
[1:16:14] church she paid her
[1:16:18] tithes but had not stepped into a
[1:16:20] relationship with
[1:16:23] God she knew how to do
[1:16:27] things she
[1:16:29] knew about God's
[1:16:33] word but there was nothing to activate
[1:16:35] that relationship with God until one
[1:16:40] day that God met with
[1:16:46] her and she
[1:16:52] realized six men or six previous
[1:16:55] relationships she was
[1:16:58] in didn't benefit her for
[1:17:02] anything but the seventh
[1:17:06] relationship this seventh
[1:17:10] relationship she had to find her
[1:17:13] beloved she had to find him she had
[1:17:16] found
[1:17:19] him and she said it seems you might be a
[1:17:23] prophet I think a
[1:17:26] prophet in this time we were sent a
[1:17:30] [Applause]
[1:17:35] prophet not only manifested all the
[1:17:37] virtues of a
[1:17:40] prophet but God himself supported this
[1:17:46] Prophet I don't need to lift up this
[1:17:49] Prophet God himself live raised him
[1:17:53] up all that I have to
[1:17:56] do believe this
[1:17:58] Prophet believe this
[1:18:04] messenger when she received the
[1:18:07] prophet's
[1:18:08] message she found out who she was and
[1:18:12] she said well I think you're a
[1:18:16] prophet like what you're speaking is the
[1:18:22] truth like I'm finding out I'm the Bride
[1:18:25] of the Lord Jesus
[1:18:26] Christ until Rebecca received the
[1:18:32] messenger until that point she knew who
[1:18:35] she
[1:18:39] was brother brandom
[1:18:43] says Christ is a mystery of God
[1:18:46] revealed preached
[1:18:50] 1963 identified
[1:18:53] oh the devil is howling about
[1:18:59] this the Manifest the truth of the
[1:19:02] promise of the word in her
[1:19:05] alone he's speaking about the Bride of
[1:19:07] the Lord Jesus
[1:19:10] Christ he speaks about the religious
[1:19:13] people he says they don't have the
[1:19:17] answer Jesus
[1:19:21] come why didn't those Pharisees
[1:19:25] the
[1:19:28] answer he said if I cast out the Devils
[1:19:30] by the Finger of
[1:19:32] God who do you cast them out
[1:19:39] by they had the
[1:19:41] word they had the
[1:19:44] word but not the
[1:19:48] power they didn't have the power to
[1:19:50] activate this this
[1:19:52] word see he stood
[1:19:56] alone and his church stands
[1:20:00] alone she's not hooked with
[1:20:05] anything but he was identified by
[1:20:12] God being the body that God dwelt
[1:20:17] in and the church is identified by his
[1:20:20] body doing the same thing
[1:20:25] she is his
[1:20:29] body we're going to repeat this
[1:20:34] again she is his
[1:20:43] body the Manifest the truth of his
[1:20:45] promised word for the last
[1:20:51] days and she and she alone stands by it
[1:20:56] that's why the devil is
[1:21:01] howling these great organizations to set
[1:21:03] something to close her
[1:21:05] up they'll never do
[1:21:09] it she'll be taken
[1:21:12] up not closed
[1:21:15] up she is now
