[25:32] amen
[25:37] God bless you brother
[25:40] it's a privileged pleasure to be with
[25:44] you here
[25:46] knowing the responsibility guess that it
[25:50] is
[25:51] to present God's word
[25:54] but we're thankful with God for this
[25:58] privilege
[26:01] you're so kind and follow me in the
[26:03] scripture
[26:05] before presenting ourselves to god
[26:08] let's read two scriptures
[26:11] yes 46 verse 10.
[26:16] then we will proceed to James 4 6.
[26:24] is
[26:28] this morning our title is fighting for
[26:31] Peace
[26:32] fighting for peace
[26:35] poquito
[26:40] so now you're gonna fight for peace
[26:49] every inch of the way he said even
[26:54] usted
[26:58] to fight for every inch amen amen
[27:03] 46 10 says
[27:08] we still I know that I am God
[27:14] I will be exalted among the Heathen I
[27:17] will be exalted in the Earth
[27:23] verse 11 the Lord of hosts is with us
[27:29] the god of Jacob is our refugees now he
[27:35] wants to be exalted he wants to be
[27:38] exalted
[27:41] when he wants he will fulfill it
[27:47] now follow me to James 4 verse
[27:52] will be reading seven and eight
[27:56] Santiago Capital
[27:58] James 4 8 says
[28:08] James 4 6 reads but he giveth more grace
[28:10] wherefore he saith God resisted the
[28:12] proud but giveth Grace unto the humble
[28:16] so
[28:20] many ourselves therefore to God resist
[28:23] the devil and he will flee from you
[28:27] now listen to verse 8
[28:31] draw a night to God yes
[28:35] and He will draw night to you because
[28:44] Sinners and purify your hearts ye
[28:46] double-minded increment
[28:51] Heavenly Father we present ourselves
[29:02] on your people's ears and may we all
[29:05] benefits
[29:08] flow freely into Pueblo in your people
[29:11] Lord
[29:13] brother
[29:31] fighting for peace
[29:35] now in the scripture of Psalms 46
[29:39] God asks us something
[29:42] God asks us to be still
[29:45] and there are truly things
[29:50] until
[29:56] you're at peace
[29:59] you cannot accomplish many things if you
[30:02] are running
[30:11] [Music]
[30:23] and they're driving 100 miles per hour
[30:28] and they're going super fast
[30:33] person cannot see the details next to
[30:36] him
[30:37] and simply see them
[30:42] but when a stoplight comes and stops
[30:48] then he can see his surroundings
[30:55] Squad police officer
[31:00] but when we're going too fast
[31:04] our focus is only forward
[31:09] but God is asking us
[31:14] so we can know who he is
[31:22] tells us in James
[31:33] if we are not calm and at peace
[31:42] God asked job one thing
[31:45] they're in job 37. let me say
[31:50] 37-14 he says this is
[31:58] and consider the wondrous works of God
[32:05] how could you consider the wonders of
[32:08] this world
[32:10] something
[32:23] is
[32:39] that will make us lose what we've
[32:42] obtained
[32:43] God asks us to become
[32:46] because God wants to show us something
[32:50] a
[32:52] credit Corazon and the message relief
[32:54] from the heart is
[33:03] one time he said we still know that I am
[33:06] God he says
[33:11] the church would only stand still long
[33:14] enough this is
[33:43] children right through it
[33:46] what if they turned around
[33:49] saying let's do it again Lord
[33:52] it wouldn't have happened certainly not
[33:55] wow wow
[33:58] [Music]
[34:00] questions
[34:37] falta
[34:45] for terminal what battle do you still
[34:47] need to finish
[34:54] says God simply made the sun set still
[34:59] under a few minutes to show you
[35:01] something
[35:05] Joshua says son stand still I'm gonna
[35:09] show you God was going to do something
[35:20] home
[35:24] but this is
[35:41] it wouldn't have done it God was going
[35:43] to do something he was going to give a
[35:45] witness to his power
[35:47] at his word he's Almighty and he's give
[35:50] a witness to it
[35:52] when Joshua was fighting this battle
[35:55] against these five rulers
[36:03] Joshua needed more time to win this
[36:05] battle
[36:07] and what he was missing was time
[36:10] what he was missing was time
[36:14] and Joshua asked God and said
[36:18] Son stay still
[36:20] amen amen
[36:26] now my question is and my question
[36:29] personally to me
[36:35] have we stayed still long enough
[36:40] for God's greatness
[36:43] manifest in us
[36:46] because God wants to manifest
[36:49] wants to show the world something
[36:53] God wants to show the world
[36:59] now everything is driven by laws in
[37:01] Islam the laws of gravity
[37:06] the transito the laws of traffic
[37:10] the laws in your home
[37:15] listen to those rules in our homes
[37:18] did you know there are rules or laws in
[37:21] church also God has laws amen amen
[37:31] [Music]
[37:33] or when you stop
[38:11] I need to stop yes
[38:34] water well
[38:37] he was tired
[38:40] sometimes we're very young and we don't
[38:44] get tired
[38:57] many things that day
[38:59] and he needed a time
[39:02] and he decided to rest
[40:03] how do I get close to God
[40:12] think about it
[40:17] how can I find my purpose
[40:31] in this life
[40:41] a Samaritan woman
[40:46] and she also stopped
[40:50] muchas she had a lot of things
[40:54] too many things on her mind
[40:58] she was not living the life she needed
[41:03] but she stopped to hear Jesus
[41:11] something's going to happen and don't
[41:13] says
[41:20] did you know you could listen to your
[41:23] own thoughts
[41:25] Padre
[41:34] [Music]
[42:20] [Music]
[42:44] it means stop and think pay attention
[42:47] about something
[42:49] Psalms 19 says
[42:53] who can understand his errors
[42:57] cleanse me thou me cleanse thou me from
[43:00] Secret faults
[43:04] because many times
[43:12] this life is fast
[43:15] verbios
[43:19] de me is
[43:25] servant also from presumptuous sins let
[43:28] them not have dominion over me then
[43:30] shall I be upright and I shall be
[43:31] innocent from the great transgressions
[43:41] let the words of my mouth and the
[43:44] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[43:46] thy sight O Lord my strength and my
[43:48] redeemer
[43:51] Hermanos
[43:52] through life course as there are things
[43:55] cannot depend on dinosaurs that do not
[43:58] depends
[44:00] many things in a Christian walk
[44:03] that don't depend on us
[44:07] there are things that do depend on us
[44:10] something
[44:14] urgent
[44:15] for us
[44:18] there are things depending on us
[44:21] our life depends
[44:23] the lives are the ones
[44:26] the lives of our children
[44:30] depend on us
[44:32] and one of the things
[44:37] and meditate
[44:42] in our path

[44:45] [Music]
[44:48] Believe from the heart
[44:52] forgive me in Mary's belief

[44:57] speaking of Joseph and Mary
[45:02] when Joseph told his wife he can say El
[45:05] esposo
[45:10] watched the husband made his wife
[45:12] meditate
[45:15] because the husband was meditating on
[45:18] God
[45:19] Jose

[45:23] Joseph looked back to her must have said

[49:42] fighting for peace
[49:46] you know uh
[49:48] it's it's just uh just a thought that's
[49:50] come to my mind
[49:53] you know the um our pastor
[49:56] he's been talking a lot about the war I
[50:00] saw Orlando muchos
[50:01] you know in the world uh
[50:05] withinro and uh
[50:07] you know we have to we have to learn how
[50:09] to fight
[50:12] you know at this moment right now
[50:17] uh Ukraine is is fighting for peace
[50:22] you know they're fighting with uh
[50:24] natural weapons
[50:28] but uh you know our Lord Jesus Christ
[50:32] he showed us how to fight without
[50:34] weapons
[50:37] without the natural weapons
[50:40] amen amen
[50:42] uh it reads like this leasi Luke 2 13
[50:46] Lucas dostress and 14. it says and
[50:50] suddenly there was with the angel a
[50:52] multitude of the Heavenly hosts praising
[50:54] God and saying
[51:02] glory to God in the highest and on Earth
[51:06] peace Good Will toward men Gloria dios
[51:11] Para Con Los Hombres you know this
[51:14] scripture is usually used around
[51:15] Christmas
[51:18] but you know the scripture says
[51:22] that when Jesus was on his way
[51:26] it said you know he said
[51:29] glory to God in the highest glorious
[51:33] and on Earth peace
[51:36] you know at that moment and as a momento
[51:39] uh your peace
[51:41] my peace may pass had landed on Earth
[51:46] amen amen and that's what we fight
[51:49] foreign
[52:29] foreign
[53:29] already
[53:30] I don't need you to tell me what to do
[53:34] you know they're completely
[53:36] misunderstandings
[53:38] what is trying to be relayed to them
[53:42] so this is the way the people were with
[53:45] John Anton says
[53:48] he was not trying to he he never he
[53:50] never grabbed a weapon
[53:53] a physical weapon not in my face to go
[53:56] fight people
[53:58] but what happens
[54:00] is that in that time
[54:02] people didn't understand what he was
[54:04] trying to do
[54:06] so he had to he had to come with with
[54:09] force
[54:11] with spiritual force
[54:13] it was a spiritual awakening
[54:18] so that they could wake up
[54:21] and see the time they were living
[54:24] and not only see the time they were
[54:26] living
[54:27] but to see how they were living amen
[54:58] America
[55:01] there's a scripture
[55:03] in John 14
[55:06] and Juan katorse verse 27.
[55:09] the word Jesus Jesus is about to leave
[55:14] his uh he he was he's about to leave
[55:17] in the physical form there and physical
[55:21] you know in his physical body
[55:25] he wants to leave them something
[55:28] John 14 27 says
[55:33] Jesus speaking to his disciples
[55:36] says please I live with you
[55:39] my peace I give unto you not is the
[55:42] world giving
[55:51] neither Let It Be Afraid
[55:54] amen amen you see uh when we talk about
[55:58] an inner Wars you know we talk about
[56:01] Ukraine fighting for peace
[56:04] you know the physical the natural is the
[56:07] type of the spiritual
[56:09] you see there has to be a uh there has
[56:11] to be a time where you fight
[56:14] oh for what you want
[56:16] amen amen and you see we all we all want
[56:19] something
[56:20] and we're all fighting foreign
[57:20] amen amen you see I wonder where we're
[57:22] at this morning
[57:24] where are you at in your life
[57:27] you see have you just have you just
[57:29] rolled over and just gave up
[57:32] you know he just walked away
[57:35] or are you ready to fight
[57:38] are you ready to fight for the peace
[57:42] of God
[57:45] amen amen you see a lot of the reasons
[57:48] the way the reason we act the way we do
[57:50] a lot of times
[57:54] because
[57:57] you see uh there's a war going on within
[58:00] internet and and when when you're losing
[58:04] the war inside
[58:08] it manifests itself
[58:11] in the external realm and El Mundo
[58:14] external you see there's people
[58:17] they say they got the peace of God
[58:20] and you know they could see a piece of
[58:23] trash in their house
[58:29] it just it just it upsets them
[58:32] to to see that and somebody else didn't
[58:36] do it
[58:38] or maybe you didn't Express Yourself the
[58:41] way that that or maybe the person that
[58:43] you're with
[58:44] Mary didn't Express themselves
[58:52] it upsets
[58:55] it makes you upset
[59:12] you see up that's not the peace of God
[59:16] that is not the peace of God
[59:20] and you just you're just manifesting
[59:24] what's happening
[59:27] you're losing the world
[59:30] but Jesus doesn't want you to lose the
[59:33] world
[59:37] the peace of God is
[59:41] it just needs to find a dwelling place
[59:45] that's what it needs
[59:47] you see the dove
[59:51] is a type of a sign of Peace
[1:00:01] what came on what Came Upon Jesus
[1:00:07] that's exactly what it was
[1:00:10] because it found a dwelling place
[1:00:13] but the father had given the son
[1:00:17] a perfect peace
[1:00:19] that's exactly what it was
[1:00:22] but you know but when we talk about you
[1:00:24] know Jesus says
[1:00:27] you know he says I give you my peace
[1:00:32] not as the world gives
[1:00:36] it because the world gives you a piece
[1:00:39] but it's only a temporary
[1:00:52] you know there's a lot of people
[1:00:54] you see if they want their kid to be
[1:00:56] quiet
[1:00:58] they give him the phone
[1:01:02] even the teenagers
[1:01:05] you want them to leave you alone
[1:01:08] just give my phone you see they don't
[1:01:11] need a phone what they need is Jesus
[1:01:14] that's exactly what they need you see
[1:01:18] but we just we just it's a substitute
[1:01:21] now you give them their phone
[1:01:23] and you try to take it away
[1:01:27] try to take it away from them
[1:01:30] and see what happens
[1:01:32] you know here's the thing about it
[1:01:35] I'm not gonna apologize for it
[1:01:39] because you know therefore
[1:02:02] they're more worried about losing their
[1:02:04] phones foreign
[1:02:28] amen amen
[1:02:38] this whole
[1:02:40] Christian work
[1:02:43] the Christian experience
[1:02:46] and this is what brother Branham says
[1:02:49] in the message Fellowship
[1:02:52] he says the Christian experience
[1:02:55] this La experiencia Cristiana is based
[1:02:58] suddenly in holy upon rest
[1:03:02] come unto me all ye that labor
[1:03:06] and heavy laden and I will give you rest
[1:03:10] he says you're tossed about with
[1:03:12] everything
[1:03:14] until you come to Christ
[1:03:18] then it's all finished yes
[1:03:21] resting in Christ
[1:03:23] perfect peace no matter what comes or
[1:03:27] goes
[1:03:29] nothing can touch us
[1:03:33] come over this comes over the shepherd
[1:03:38] amen amen and it says it says all things
[1:03:41] work for the goods
[1:03:46] amen amen that's when you have perfect
[1:03:48] peace
[1:03:50] you see how when you have that perfect
[1:03:53] peace
[1:03:54] there's nothing that can move you right
[1:03:56] now the external things
[1:03:59] has the environment around you
[1:04:03] can't it can't move you
[1:04:05] have perfect peace
[1:04:08] I want to talk about Jesus for a moment
[1:04:11] you see that was the time in his life
[1:04:16] when he had preached all he had preached
[1:04:19] all day
[1:04:20] no that was his business yes you know he
[1:04:24] came to preach the good news
[1:04:26] and you know he become tired
[1:04:30] in his physical form and and sufisika Su
[1:04:34] physical
[1:04:35] and uh he he goes in and he he gets in
[1:04:38] the ship
[1:04:39] now you know he said let's go to the
[1:04:41] other side
[1:04:44] he tells his disciples
[1:04:50] you know there's a great storm that rose
[1:04:52] up
[1:05:52] thank you you can't hold yourself
[1:05:54] together
[1:05:56] before you know you're screaming at
[1:05:58] everybody
[1:06:00] just screaming at everybody in your
[1:06:02] house
[1:06:03] just screaming at your co-workers you're
[1:06:06] yelling at your brother
[1:06:08] you know you're just you're just
[1:06:10] frustrated you see that is not perfect
[1:06:13] peace
[1:06:14] that is that's not peace at all
[1:06:18] amen amen it's just not no ass and the
[1:06:22] thing about it is
[1:06:23] these people were worried
[1:06:26] these disciples were worried
[1:06:29] but they had Jesus
[1:06:38] they would have just been like glory to
[1:06:41] God
[1:06:42] I've never seen anything like this
[1:06:44] before
[1:06:45] but Jesus is with me
[1:06:48] you see but they wake him up
[1:06:51] the boat is shaking yes
[1:07:16] you see he was so in connection with God
[1:07:21] that any storm that came his way
[1:07:25] couldn't move
[1:07:27] he was just so connected with God
[1:07:31] that's the external things
[1:07:35] all the trials everything that come his
[1:07:39] way
[1:07:40] he would just be like that's okay that's
[1:07:43] implemented
[1:07:44] I got peace you see that the peace that
[1:07:48] these disciples didn't have
[1:07:51] you see and I believe but that when we
[1:07:54] are with Jesus
[1:07:55] but when we I have that peace
[1:07:59] that we should be in the same way
[1:08:02] we should have that trust
[1:08:05] and the reason we don't
[1:08:08] know it's because there's no
[1:08:10] reconciliation
[1:08:12] I want to tell you peace
[1:08:16] only comes through reconciliation
[1:08:20] that's what the Bible says
[1:08:22] the peace only comes through
[1:08:24] reconciliation
[1:08:31] probably not no probably not I'm
[1:08:33] guessing you're not
[1:08:35] and
[1:08:51] um
[1:08:52] you know maybe like what they did no you
[1:08:55] didn't don't like yeah you don't like
[1:08:57] what they did uh
[1:09:01] hello
[1:09:12] whatever I'm not talking to you
[1:09:16] I didn't do anything wrong
[1:09:18] see that was you so if we said that you
[1:09:22] should come say sorry to me
[1:09:24] I'm right okay and you're wrong hey you
[1:09:29] even bring you even bring the word into
[1:09:31] it
[1:09:32] but the Bible says
[1:09:36] what you should do okay
[1:09:38] you should humble yourself
[1:09:41] that's exactly what you should do you
[1:09:45] see because you can't have peace
[1:09:47] unless there's reconciliation
[1:09:50] you see James chapter 4 verse 1 says
[1:09:53] this
[1:09:54] it says it says from whence comes Wars
[1:09:57] and fighting amongst you yeah
[1:10:01] hands even of your lust that war in your
[1:10:04] members
[1:10:07] you see it's the war's not out there
[1:10:10] how's the war's in here
[1:10:44] you see he wants to give you peace
[1:10:49] he wants to give you perfect
[1:10:53] you see I I didn't want to wait till the
[1:10:55] end to say this but I'm gonna have to
[1:10:57] okay
[1:10:59] it says the Hebrew word of Peace
[1:11:06] you know it means freedom from trouble
[1:11:09] and much more
[1:11:12] um freedom trouble and much more
[1:11:13] libertad problems it means experiencing
[1:11:17] the highest good
[1:11:19] experimentary
[1:11:20] enjoying the very best
[1:11:36] it means prosperity in the whitest sense
[1:11:42] especially prosperity in the spiritual
[1:11:44] sense
[1:11:46] of having a soul that blossoms and
[1:11:49] flourishes
[1:11:51] you see that's what peace is
[1:11:54] what he wants to give
[1:11:57] he wants to give you the best that he
[1:12:00] can give you
[1:12:01] you see when Jesus was here on Earth
[1:12:04] I want you to understand
[1:12:07] what he was going through
[1:12:09] the Journey that he took
[1:12:12] if he could only make it only make that
[1:12:15] Journey
[1:12:17] with the inner peace
[1:12:20] that's the only way he was able to do
[1:12:48] um
[1:12:49] foreign
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:13:17] but I just remember as a young man
[1:13:21] not even as a young man
[1:13:24] I was probably about two three years old
[1:13:27] and uh you know I come from a broken
[1:13:31] home
[1:13:33] and and just like maybe many of us
[1:13:37] how many how many in here have been I've
[1:13:40] feel broken many times
[1:13:42] muchas amongst broken people estamos
[1:13:47] but you know one of the things that I
[1:13:49] just recall
[1:13:52] how was when the night time would come
[1:13:55] you know my father he drank a lot
[1:14:01] and uh and you know he I just knew that
[1:14:04] you know at night he was going to come
[1:14:07] maybe two three years old
[1:14:11] and uh and and I just knew well I just
[1:14:14] knew that I I would just be hearing
[1:14:15] things
[1:14:16] I was just new I would be hearing things
[1:14:18] you know at night
[1:14:21] you know but I'm in in my before I would
[1:14:24] go to sleep
[1:14:26] I just I would just be I would just you
[1:14:28] know I would just want to hear the door
[1:14:31] open you're okay
[1:14:34] because I I knew uh that after the door
[1:14:38] opened
[1:14:40] yeah I could get up
[1:14:42] and maybe uh do something for my mom
[1:14:47] maybe protector
[1:14:49] maybe stand up for her
[1:14:52] and you know
[1:14:54] sometimes I would oh this is Lucia and
[1:14:57] sometimes I couldn't
[1:14:58] and you know it's it's one of those
[1:15:01] things yes you know I I knew it was
[1:15:04] coming okay
[1:15:06] and uh you know there was there's just a
[1:15:08] war inside of you
[1:15:10] know I just remember that
[1:15:12] momentum uh because you know I just I
[1:15:15] think God was just allowed me to go
[1:15:17] through those things
[1:15:19] he allowed me to see violence in my home
[1:15:23] both physical and verbal physical but
[1:15:27] you know because he was preparing me for
[1:15:28] another War okay
[1:15:30] who's preparing me for a war you know
[1:15:33] that that we were all we would all be
[1:15:34] fighting
[1:15:36] maybe one day we'd understand
[1:15:39] that everything we went through
[1:15:42] all the inner struggles
[1:15:45] all the battles we've had
[1:15:48] that they haven't been invade okay
[1:15:54] it was a schooling of Jesus
[1:15:57] maybe one day
[1:15:59] you might see
[1:16:01] that what you went through the struggles
[1:16:05] and the pain
[1:16:06] the suffering
[1:16:09] the tiredness
[1:16:13] it was all for something
[1:16:16] it was all for somebody else
[1:16:19] yeah you may have seen violence
[1:16:22] like maybe you've been through pain
[1:16:24] and maybe you've been tired
[1:16:27] you know sometimes I get tired
[1:16:30] and you know sometimes I'm like I don't
[1:16:33] even know what to do sometimes
[1:16:37] but then I look at my kids
[1:16:40] I look at my look at the church but they
[1:16:43] were like less I look at the people
[1:16:45] and I gotta keep going
[1:16:48] I gotta keep fighting I can't give up
[1:16:52] even if they don't take me okay no
[1:16:55] matter this guy I just want I just
[1:16:58] wanted him to thank you
[1:17:00] I just want to make sure
[1:17:03] but it's enough
[1:17:05] that's enough
[1:17:07] it may not be enough for the people
[1:17:11] but I'm not here to please
[1:17:23] the surprise is all understandings
[1:17:31] that's what I desire
[1:17:33] that's why I wake up early
