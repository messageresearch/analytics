TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] do this morning i like to read two more scripts so that we can place my thoughts and this one just ties in perfectly with the scriptures that we have just read when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and finding none he sayeth i will return unto my house once i came out and when it comes he finds it swept and garnished then go with him take us to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bears thee and the past which thou hast sucked but he said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of god and keep it apocalypse revelations chapter one verse one two three the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent forth and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw foreign is he that readers and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand gracias thank you i have taken this scripture without knowing what brother johnny was going to be teaching this morning and it concerns the fact that right now is being fought the most greatest battle that has ever been fought in this battle this fight this war it's a spiritual battle now i know that the bible says that the flesh less is against the spirit they're in enmity the flesh and the spirit but as we delve into the word a little more encounter we find out that there are two powers that exist and the apostle paul he uh clarifies it when he tells us he says thanks be to the father his son jesus christ and the work of jesus christ is to deliver us out of the evil clause of satan and it says here textually that he has delivered therefore he's speaking here when everything is reduced down [Music] and the only thing that can make darkness flee that's why in the beginning in the book of genesis because when the light comes loose being that god himself being that his word is a lamp onto our feet when the light comes is the word of we find out that [Music] it was his own disciple that betrayed him without a defense [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that he died [Music] and [Music] ah [Music] so [Music] so [Applause] do [Music] [Applause] so [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] do [Applause] [Music] [Music]

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] me [Music] a i [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] ezekiel and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh in that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof and to the others he said in mind hearing go you after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have you pity anton says so there's an angel here that is but he destroys and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption we're going to be speaking on the seal of his power let us pray celestial heavenly father give you thanks my god that you are here that you said where there are two or three numbers there's not a doubt in our house you are is that's what i want to speak about this morning we want to take a look we've been speaking sunday mornings of the exiles from babylon departure from babylon and the return to jerusalem and what was happening there because that's a type of not only of the time of the lord jesus christ 1965 april 10th the word of god was spoken many many hundreds of years before his coming fiction of his crucifixion is we'll be going through these services perhaps next week as we listen to it and of all churches but of all days and all the things that jesus did and certainly todd for ourselves repeat easter morning oh crucificado be crucified he let himself be else foreign there was a unique symbol or a unique signature from the king let everyone else know wherever this seal is it was only unique to the king documents officials many times they signed official documents they sealed it with this sickness where it could be flexible to or prove that it was from the king the king he never took it off to make sure that people knew this was from the king's behalf and the document was genuine could depend on that seal we know different different places in the bible were these signets were used one of them but that gave her authority [Music] go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of men that cyan cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof now remember remember that ezekiel esta professando's prophesying diablando and this is where i want now in the first year of cyrus king of persia i enjoy what it says that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be foreign for the the word [Applause] for a son of god count on it [Music] now these are the children of the province that went up out of the cap out of captivity of those which had been carried away from whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away into babylon and came again unto jerusalem and judah everyone unto his city now i just want to read the first part of verse 2. whom came with serbia i need to speak a little bit see what it says hide still has power oh is [Music] is that fine with everyone so you'll see him it says that people that departed with zerubbabel god deliver the people from babylon now look uh i believe if we're gonna depart from babylon put yourself in babylon because we've all been in babylon in babylon religion the liberal apocalypse of revelation says why are we coming [Music] where are you headed as if i'm coming from a place because i'm going to a better place not coming out of a place go to because this has to do with that in this [Music] i'm satisfied a bunch of relig uh free gatherings yes lodges solamentes chips yes this is is original [Applause] [Music] they knew one thing is existed [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] apart from babylon why would were they leaving they needed a good reason you're not just going to leave everything just because you have is [Music] hallelujah [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] many times what it says in revelation i heard another voice from heaven come out of her follow me my people out of her people yes you will be destroyed with her this is where [Music] i can imagine before she started that she had some thoughts in her mind like this what if it isn't right okay well what if it is it is right yeah and there is it's this message [Music] [Music] oh take it all is that's what these people were thinking that left babylon this man's aruba bell no it's not just any man god is with him i chose him yes who i am [Applause] [Music] before he let me tell you they wouldn't not just leave just to leave you already i told the lord jesus christ of california before living in california i'm not leaving here unless you do something great you know my way is that key i'm not leaving i was raised something great if you [Applause] he's the same [Music] not only of jesus christ [Applause] [Music] she did take that loads of silver gold mirror frankincense she got ready to make her start hey she might have thought if it's true i'll support it that's my the one that proved me brothers you have another sickness somewhere else bring it to me but he said el dijo jesus christ when he reveals power if when they go up and put a big part of lily's in the alternative you're not quite eliminated god don't want lily's on there he wants you on the altar altars wasn't filled for little bit [Music] [Music] [Applause] um all sorrow and sadness went away on
