[11:48] amen and i'll go ahead and read it
[11:52] a line which is strongest among beasts
[11:55] and turn it not away for any eleon
[12:00] animals
[12:04] amen uh if the brothers in the back can
[12:06] help me out with the video see le
[12:08] ceremony
[12:18] we're going to be starting a new a new
[12:20] character
[12:36] and uh just to start it off a little bit
[12:40] i'd like to read a quote from brother
[12:42] branham
[12:45] and the and
[12:47] uh it's from the message faith coming by
[12:49] hearing in this element
[12:52] and it reads like this
[12:55] it says you see
[12:56] mira
[12:58] fates berlin
[13:05] for nada as i once said
[13:09] faith has hair on the chest
[13:12] when it stands up
[13:14] and pulls its big muscles out
[13:17] everything else vanishes away
[13:34] so pretty much what burley is so lo que
[13:36] es fornado it's something that's strong
[13:39] and he says also that faith has chest
[13:41] hair it is
[13:44] meaning that it's something that's
[13:45] that's manly you know something that can
[13:46] move quite
[13:50] masculine yeah um
[13:54] uh sorry bear with me i'm a little
[13:56] nervous
[13:58] hey man i believe that abraham had this
[13:59] kind of fate too
[14:03] he was willing to leave everything he
[14:04] knew say it again he was willing to
[14:06] leave everything that he knew
[14:10] and it's because he knew that he knew
[14:11] who he was a man
[14:13] he knew he was the son of god
[14:17] of a lion
[14:18] leon and i say a lion
[14:20] leon because i believe that not a lion
[14:22] knows who he is
[14:25] he doesn't need anybody to tell him that
[14:27] he's not
[14:29] everybody already knows when the lion
[14:30] comes say it again everybody already
[14:32] knows when the lion comes around
[14:35] vienna and he knows it as well amen
[14:38] nobody should have to tell us who we are
[14:42] tell
[14:57] amen i also believe that abraham had
[14:59] faith that endured
[15:00] [Music]
[15:05] as the title says
[15:07] he waited 25 years for isaac
[15:24] i believe that each day that each day
[15:26] that the each day that he had no results
[15:31] he was closer to the promise
[15:36] i think they're going to play the video
[15:45] if the lion is the king of the jungle
[15:49] how can he be the king of the jungle
[15:52] if he's not the biggest
[15:54] the elephant is probably one of the
[15:56] biggest
[15:58] he can't be the fastest because that's a
[15:59] cheater
[16:01] he can't be the smartest
[16:04] so he's not the biggest the fastest or
[16:06] the smartest
[16:08] so how does a lion
[16:11] become the king of the jungle
[16:14] his mentality
[16:16] [Music]
[16:17] that's the only difference of a lion and
[16:19] an elephant
[16:21] when a lion walks up and sees an
[16:23] elephant he thinks lunch
[16:26] or elephant things run
[16:29] and it's all mentality
[16:32] because when a male lion walks up he may
[16:34] be outnumbered by a pack of hyenas
[16:37] but i'm king
[16:39] of my jungle because of my mentality
[16:42] what happens when you're a gazelle and
[16:44] you're not being pushed you're not being
[16:46] prodded you're not giving it a reward
[16:48] nobody's encouraging you what happens
[16:50] when you're a gazelle and the lion's not
[16:52] chasing anymore you stop grinding but
[16:55] what happens when you're a lion when you
[16:57] are a lion it does not make a difference
[17:00] you realize that if your family is going
[17:02] to eat that if that pack of lions is to
[17:05] survive then you gotta go hunt
[17:10] a part of being a beast just ain't even
[17:11] gazelle a part of being a beast is the
[17:14] hush
[17:15] it's the heart that they're excited
[17:16] about they like to see the gazelles run
[17:18] then boom they take off because real
[17:20] lions like to hunt they love the process
[17:24] just as much as they love the prize and
[17:25] some of y'all just want to score you
[17:27] don't like the process you're not in
[17:29] love with the process a true hunter's
[17:32] goal is not the prize a true hunter's
[17:35] goal is to hunt that's what they live
[17:37] for they live to hunt they don't just
[17:40] live to catch it it's the whole process
[17:42] when you are a true hunter you don't go
[17:44] by time you go by the gazelle when you
[17:47] are a true hunter you hunt until you get
[17:49] a gazelle and you don't stop until you
[17:51] get one and then you get another and
[17:53] then you get another and you get another
[17:55] if you gonna do what you say you're
[17:57] gonna do be what you say you're gonna be
[17:59] you're gonna have to lie me out you're a
[18:00] gazelle you won't come up short you're a
[18:03] gazelle you're gonna have an average
[18:05] experience you're a student i need you
[18:06] in lion mode you're an entrepreneur i
[18:09] need you in line more you're trying to
[18:10] lose weight lying mo you can't do
[18:13] nothing significant in gazelle mode
[18:15] nothing nothing impressive happens in
[18:17] gazelle mode nothing happened in run
[18:19] mode give up mode quit mode scared mode
[18:22] fearful mode nothing happens everything
[18:24] happened in line mode like i'm coming to
[18:26] get you
[18:29] hey man
[18:31] i feel like i don't even have to preach
[18:33] anymore
[18:36] i was kind of afraid to show the video
[18:37] because of that
[18:40] for the
[18:42] amen so we'll just go ahead and go over
[18:44] the the characteristics of faith again
[18:49] so faith is burley man
[18:52] is for
[18:54] uh here on foreign
[18:56] chest
[19:04] amen
[19:05] amen
[19:06] amen and uh faith is also tenacious
[19:12] and what that means
[19:14] what tenacious means
[19:17] is holding on
[19:19] when it's more attractive to let go
[19:22] of amen when it's
[19:26] when it's more attractive to let go
[19:30] and so then abraham had to leave the
[19:31] world behind bro
[19:34] everything he knew
[19:36] elsa yeah
[19:50] but we just need to develop it and
[19:51] strengthen it
[19:58] why does our faith fail sometimes
[20:03] because we still haven't fully uh
[20:04] decided to commit to god
[20:10] some days we're all foray and other days
[20:12] it's it seems like we're we're not sure
[20:16] but lions have an instinct
[20:46] the lion's instincts set him apart
[20:50] is what sets us apart
[20:56] why doesn't our faith endure sometimes
[21:02] our faith doesn't endure because we
[21:03] build it on shifting sands
[21:12] we build it upon our mind upon what we
[21:14] think
[21:28] faith needs something solid to be built
[21:29] on
[21:31] solido
[21:35] is the word of god amen
[21:38] and our faith can't be built on our
[21:39] emotions
[21:42] we feel like
[21:50] and our faith doesn't endure because
[21:51] sometimes we want it to happen instantly
[22:09] that kind of faith is
[22:23] [Music]
[22:24] faith that
[22:26] doesn't want to suffer
[22:29] that faith that doesn't want to be
[22:30] tested
[22:33] the gazelle is only wrong when they're
[22:34] being chased brothers
[23:06] and your back's up against
[23:16] that's the kind of faith of a lion
[23:18] brother
[23:20] that's abraham's face
[23:22] why because lions are active brothers
[23:26] lions are lions are
[23:27] they're real their faith is real it's
[23:29] genuine
[23:32] and faith without works is
[23:55] say it again if we want a gazelle
[23:57] there's a book full of them right here
[23:59] are you unlimited
[24:00] all you have to do is keep chasing them
[24:02] brothers
[24:16] god's only as big as you want to be
[24:21] if you want to if you want a great god
[24:24] grande he's a great god
[24:27] if you want to make believe god
[24:33] then he's uh he's a make-believe guy man
[24:38] amen
[24:39] amen glory to god
[24:56] it all happens when you have the faith
[24:58] of a lion brothers
[25:01] like he said you can't do anything when
[25:02] you're in gazelle mode
[25:07] you can't do anything without suffering
[25:09] nope as i said now
[25:10] without your faith being tested
[25:14] now just think about that one thing
[25:18] that problem is
[25:20] whatever you're going through
[25:22] whatever you need in your life right now
[25:25] and and just pray for it brothers
[25:29] and have that mentality of a lion
[25:30] brothers
[25:32] don't give up whatever whatever it is
[25:36] i believe that that god that god has
[25:38] already given it to you
[25:44] [Applause]
[25:52] amen god bless you brothers
[25:54] god
[26:09] i would rather be right here than be
[26:10] anywhere else
[26:13] we could be out there in the world
[26:16] we could be out there
[26:18] we chose to be here
[26:20] amen
[26:22] if you could please stand brothers
[26:25] if you could please open your bibles to
[26:27] genesis chapter 12 verse 103.
[26:33] when you have peace
[26:50] out of thy country
[27:31] along with the scripture i want to read
[27:32] a quote from brother branham
[27:37] called israel in egypt
[27:40] is the israelite
[27:42] preached in 1953
[27:45] and it says like this
[28:28] not because
[28:41] i'm going to save your
[29:09] my brothers and i chose
[29:25] you shouldn't have fifth like a gazelle
[29:30] because then we prefer to run
[29:32] in this now i would like to speak about
[29:34] something very important
[29:37] which is the faith of
[29:38] abraham see abraham's life
[29:42] was one of the biggest examples of faith
[29:44] in obedience
[29:48] abraham's influence
[29:50] influence
[29:51] came to spread in all the families of
[29:53] the years
[29:56] we already know abraham is the father of
[29:59] faith
[30:03] what happened in abraham's life
[30:06] is something that we have to understand
[30:10] because it is for each and every one of
[30:12] us
[30:15] and why is it friction
[30:18] the apostle paul says in galatians
[30:20] chapter 3 verse
[30:34] according to the promise
[30:38] we all come from the seat of abraham
[30:42] and abraham came to also be the father
[30:44] of faith
[30:47] and why in the father of faith
[31:18] and out of your parents house
[31:20] you know i asked myself this question
[31:23] you know why would god do that
[31:26] why would god ask abraham to leave his
[31:28] home
[31:44] we're attached to the things of this of
[31:46] outsiders
[31:50] i wanted to tell a question to the youth
[31:54] you know how many of us are here in
[31:56] church
[31:58] but
[32:26] from come from the bad cut from that bad
[32:29] influence
[32:31] you know and by god saying all of that
[32:35] all that was to start a new beginning
[32:40] and us brothers
[32:46] [Music]
[33:08] you uh the middle you're rejoicing
[33:11] do you really want to follow me
[33:14] then let go of everything
[33:17] let all those bad habits that you have
[33:22] oh
[33:36] how about give me a
[33:39] [Applause]
[33:46] and that's why he asked us to leave our
[33:48] bad habits
[33:56] and sometimes even things in this family
[33:59] in the family but we don't want to
[34:01] because we prefer to keep those bad
[34:03] habits with us
[34:18] uh
[34:25] you see
[34:27] abraham
[34:29] there was something about him
[34:33] abraham had disobedience
[34:36] over the inside that was unbreakable
[34:40] you see abraham he left right away
[34:45] i want to read a quote by brother brown
[34:59] he only made this promise to abraham
[35:01] after you have given a test
[35:07] the seed of abraham must first be tested
[35:09] to see if they really believe the word
[35:26] and was tested whether he believed it or
[35:28] not
[35:43] or will we take what man said about it
[35:47] we take what some organization has made
[35:49] up as a creed
[35:56] or do we take what god said
[35:59] if god's word is true
[36:02] we believe god's word regardless of what
[36:04] anything else is
[36:52] everyone in this room
[37:06] we might not be tested like how exactly
[37:08] how abraham
[37:10] exactly
[37:12] but we will be testing in our character
[37:16] we will be testing our patients
[37:19] and in our
[37:34] he's going to put us through tests
[37:37] he is going to put us to test in trials
[37:41] you see one of the biggest tests
[37:46] was not when god asked him to leave his
[37:47] land
[37:50] i believe it was the biggest test when
[37:51] god asked abraham to sacrifice his son
[37:53] isaac
[38:00] you know i can't imagine how hard it was
[38:02] for abraham
[38:13] and you know some people might wonder uh
[38:31] yes god already knew abraham's love
[38:35] you just wanted to see if abraham really
[38:37] put him first in life
[38:42] if he truly loved him
[38:58] you see god doesn't test us
[39:01] so that he may know what's in our heart
[39:05] he tests us
[39:07] so that we may know what's in here
[39:11] because without the trauma
[39:22] you see god is going to put us in trials
[39:26] and many times it won't
[39:53] it would be hard for us to let go of
[39:54] things
[39:57] it's going to be hard to let go of those
[39:59] bad habits that we have
[40:02] who are we to question god
[40:06] knows what's best for us
[40:22] let's start trusting god
[40:25] putting faith in god
[40:28] even when things don't make sense
[40:31] because like it says in proverbs chapter
[40:33] 3 verse 5.
[40:36] proverbs
[40:59] god
[41:01] [Applause]
[41:09] can you guys hear me yeah i'll see you
[41:11] later man god bless our brother uh
[41:12] samuel diego for that word
[41:18] brother branham says that i know what i
[41:20] know
[41:21] uh we all have a super sense
[41:27] and that's our that's a sixth sense yes
[41:30] which is faith
[41:32] and we need that in order to let go of
[41:34] what we are attached to on this earth
[41:40] he says that that sense
[41:43] dominates all others
[42:03] i'll just read a and then we'll uh
[42:06] we'll stop there um hebrews 11 8
[42:11] it says by by by faith abraham when he
[42:13] was called to go into a place which he
[42:16] which he should after receive an
[42:17] inheritance obeyed and he went out not
[42:20] knowing whether he went
[42:36] abraham
[42:43] oh give me one second sorry
[42:44] uh but uh we're so we're in the topic of
[42:47] uh
[42:48] uh and the bible character of abraham
[42:50] estamos
[42:54] and abraham like our brothers uh they
[42:56] said
[43:09] to leave his friends his family
[43:27] so god tells abraham
[43:29] abraham i have a plan for you
[43:32] i won't tell you what it is
[43:34] the plan i will not give you the details
[43:38] but you have to trust me
[43:40] out in me just know now
[43:42] you cannot stay here
[43:48] you cannot possess the things that you
[43:49] have no no
[43:52] and have
[44:06] you have to let go
[44:08] you know
[44:10] brothers if you want to exp a a
[44:13] a new level of experience with god get
[44:15] us a higher experience
[44:20] is going to take some obedience
[44:24] you know and the problem with us is
[44:27] that we have a spirit we have an
[44:29] attitude
[44:30] of unwillingness
[44:32] [Music]
[44:47] we all in here have something
[44:50] that god has told us to let go
[44:55] to let go long time ago
[44:59] we're still holding on to it
[45:20] you you could say oh i stopped drinking
[45:22] and smoking this is opaque
[45:25] but your eyes say otherwise but
[45:28] the smell that you have on you say
[45:30] otherwise
[45:33] god i haven't watched pornography in
[45:35] over two months
[45:38] god i haven't used profanity
[45:41] i haven't used makeup
[45:44] you know it's not about when was the
[45:46] last time you used it
[45:49] oh how long it's been
[45:52] about what have you done
[45:55] to block it out of your life
[45:58] i want to obey god
[46:01] i want to obey god
[46:02] coming out of my mouth
[46:05] i want to obey god with the things
[46:06] coming out of my mouth
[46:10] with what my eyes see they're located
[46:12] my
[46:27] but that's obvious just to resist resist
[46:31] to disobey
[46:33] is to go against god
[46:37] you know if it's hard to to
[46:39] to obey god
[46:51] you know we start putting excuses and
[46:53] justifying ourselves
[46:57] and we might say oh but what if uh god's
[47:00] will is not what i want
[47:07] that's right i think this is better for
[47:10] me
[47:12] this will be better for my life
[47:16] god says i'm gonna change my my my my
[47:18] plans the other miraculous way can be
[47:21] planned and he will understand and get
[47:23] the point
[47:26] god has me waiting too much that's not
[47:28] for me
[47:31] this is something that i struggle myself
[47:32] with
[47:36] the hardest discipline discipline for me
[47:40] discipline i think for any christian
[47:43] christian is waiting is esperanto amen
[47:46] we take two steps
[47:48] forward
[47:50] and god
[48:02] and i want you to understand as well
[48:32] but we do have control over our
[48:34] preparedness for that promise
[48:40] the way we prepare ourselves
[48:43] and how long we take to prepare
[48:45] ourselves
[48:54] from giving us the promise that he he's
[48:57] going to give us
[49:01] you know and and james in the book of
[49:03] james
[49:06] he tells us that uh
[49:08] let patience be be perfected in us
[49:14] so that we could be complete
[49:17] and lack nothing later on in life amen
[49:23] i'm a reader hebrews 11 uh i'll skip
[49:25] nine let's go to ten hebrews 11 10.
[49:27] vamos aller ebreos onse
[49:29] it says for he looked for a city which
[49:31] has foundations whose builder and maker
[49:34] is god
[49:38] fundamental
[49:40] architecture
[49:43] you know by faith abraham
[49:47] uh
[49:48] he uh
[49:49] he chose to live as a as a foreigner
[49:54] so he wouldn't get attached to your
[50:06] you know god told abraham
[50:09] i would take you to the to what i
[50:11] promised to you
[50:14] but you were you're gonna have to go
[50:16] through some tough times
[50:20] you're gonna go through struggles
[50:22] uh difficult you're gonna problem
[50:49] and we will walk in the lowest point of
[50:52] life
[51:16] and it amazes me because some like jesus
[51:18] put as an example
[51:32] you know and so let me so i'm gonna tell
[51:34] you so let's
[51:35] go when you're in your lowest point of
[51:37] your life
[51:39] and bring the kingdom of heaven to your
[51:41] onto down to earth
[51:45] you know jesus when he was walking
[51:47] through all that israel jordan
[52:16] just going through what he went through
[52:19] el paso he probably didn't understand
[52:20] what god had for him
[52:24] but even like that he obeyed
[52:27] and what amazes me
[52:31] is that the bible says that abraham is
[52:35] that everywhere he went
[52:38] he carried his altar
[52:41] he had an altar with him at all times
[53:22] you know when he found himself in
[53:24] desperation not knowing what to do
[53:48] i used to leave my altar here
[53:53] and just come and pick it up every
[53:54] sunday
[53:55] evening
[53:58] no and it shouldn't be like that
[54:00] we should give god our worship every
[54:02] single day
[54:08] brother branham says that
[54:10] abraham was tested
[54:13] but not not just abraham
[54:16] but his seed as well
[54:19] you know isaac was tested as well
[54:22] when god told abraham to to sacrifice
[54:25] isaac
[54:29] you know and i could just picture a
[54:30] father i could picture abraham
[54:34] all day staying confused
[54:48] that morning
[54:55] [Music]
[55:02] and uh the message abraham's covenant
[55:03] confirmed
[55:25] [Music]
[55:27] you know this just brings to my to my to
[55:29] my to my mind
[55:32] i don't know how many been to a brother
[55:33] alex's house in his backyard
[55:41] i'm the only one

[55:50] but in his backyard
[55:54] there's uh he has like a fire pit
[55:58] um
[56:01] okay and that that just came to my mind
[56:02] yes
[56:04] you know i figured that's how maybe
[56:05] abraham set it up he put stones
[56:13] and then the fire and all that el
[56:20] god will provide for himself a lamp for
[56:23] this sacrifice
[56:25] [Music]
[56:27] there you are
[56:29] thing i'm doing is just following
[56:31] instructions
[56:35] it's up to god to provide the lamb
[56:37] depended on
[56:39] how am i going to receive my sight how
[56:41] am i going to come over
[56:54] without failure god will provide for
[56:56] himself a lamb for the sacrifice
[57:02] it was through abraham's face
[57:10] he he got in with the with the program
[57:12] he knew what was happening
[57:17] abraham and isaac
[57:20] we're going up the mountain on one side
[57:24] god had already had the ram going up the
[57:26] other side
[57:29] you know god had the ram already
[57:32] he had already provided
[57:36] that lamb
[57:37] hey man i'm gonna be closing the
[57:39] musicians could come forward

[57:58] to your own self
[58:03] you know god will resurrect something
[58:05] out of you
[58:09] [Music]

[58:18] christ
[58:34] you know
[58:35] jesus didn't want to die jesus no more
[58:38] he the bible says that he prays
[58:42] he prayed three times before before
[58:44] being crucified
