[21:31] opportunities
[21:33] for the opportunity he's given us this
[21:35] evening

[21:40] internet
[21:47] and then tell them God bless you
[21:50] see you this evening
[21:55] when you're finished if you go with me
[21:58] to First Samuel 16 13.
[22:02] speaking of the characters of The Bible
[22:05] and our character continues being David
[22:09] the title this evening is
[22:13] the small things will take you to the
[22:15] greater things
[22:16] [Music]
[22:19] first Samuel 16 13.
[22:22] when you have it you could say Amen
[22:25] Manny
[22:27] um
[22:29] let's wait for our brothers are looking
[22:31] for the scripture
[22:34] hey man this has seen it says like this
[22:36] is
[22:49] Anointed him in the midst of his
[22:51] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[22:53] Upon David from that day forward so
[22:55] Samuel rose up and went to Rama
[22:59] and first Samuel 18.
[23:02] two chapters after
[23:15] and the woman answered one another as
[23:17] they played and said Saul had slain his
[23:20] thousands and David his ten thousands
[23:26] one more scripture first Samuel 18 verse
[23:30] 11. hey this is like this
[23:38] and Saul cast a javelin for he said I
[23:41] will Smite David even to the wall with
[23:43] it and David avoided out of his presence
[23:45] twice
[23:49] in the prayer Celestial is
[23:53] the father we're grateful this evening
[23:57] because we are undeserving to be here
[24:01] you make us perfect before your eyes
[24:04] you
[24:06] I said this word would be of help to my
[24:08] brothers
[24:11] she would move in the ears in the mind
[24:13] of my brothers
[24:16] would give us a revelation of your word
[24:19] this evening
[24:21] and help those that are on their way
[24:23] Lord
[24:30] Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may be
[24:33] Cedar brothers
[24:38] and there's more room about David in the
[24:41] Bible
[24:42] than any other characters
[24:45] besides Jesus
[24:47] there's more about Jesus as number one
[24:51] and number two it's about more about
[24:55] David is David David has 66 chapters
[25:10] his name is mentioned over 600 times in
[25:13] the Bible is
[25:18] and an interesting fact uh
[25:22] never
[25:24] an interesting fact is David is the only
[25:26] man because
[25:28] who is called a man after God's Own
[25:32] Hearts
[25:34] the only man who has called that in the
[25:37] Bible
[25:38] and this can bring confliction to us
[25:42] because David committed adultery
[25:46] and he wasn't perfect
[25:48] he slept with someone else's wife
[25:54] you know he said he wasn't perfect
[25:58] and that's good to know for us tonight
[26:02] nobody here is perfect
[26:04] if someone's perfect you came to the
[26:07] wrong place
[26:09] there's only Imperfects here
[26:13] for now with a healthy heart
[26:16] you can have a healthy leadership
[26:20] and with a toxic heart
[26:32] that he saw allowed his heart to
[26:35] gradually turn against God
[26:40] wasn't all of a sudden but it was
[26:42] gradually slowly
[26:46] and now uh leadership
[26:49] is stewardship is leadership is
[26:53] stewardship is
[26:59] leadership if you can get something
[27:01] tonight
[27:03] leadership and stewardship is
[27:07] if you don't Steward your leadership
[27:10] right so you still knows
[27:12] God can pull you out of there at any
[27:15] time
[27:17] because God puts Kings and takes Kings
[27:20] off
[27:21] and when a leader doesn't let himself be
[27:24] led by God
[27:26] he will self-destruct his own leadership
[27:32] self-destruct his own leadership
[27:35] and the difference between Saul and
[27:37] David's heart was this
[27:41] if you're taking notes
[27:45] Saul had a fear of man
[27:49] and David had fear of God
[27:53] Saul was worried
[27:56] and David worshiped
[27:58] [Music]
[28:02] and David wanted God's presence
[28:14] [Music]
[28:28] now David was being faithful in the in
[28:31] the fields shepherding
[28:36] before he was anointed by Samuel Anthony
[28:40] and now think about yourself
[28:43] where are we being faithful to God
[28:47] are you working for God
[28:50] where does God have you working
[28:55] some theologians
[28:57] I was looking this up
[29:01] say that when Samuel anointed David uh
[29:08] that that Samuel came to to David and he
[29:12] whispered to him
[29:18] you're going to be Israel's Future King
[29:21] Israel what does a person do with that
[29:26] what would you do with that okay so
[29:30] uh quickly here
[29:32] I remember one time I was in prayer here
[29:37] and our pastor anointed me with oil
[29:41] and I thought I was
[29:44] um over my head
[29:47] um
[29:47] I thought I was very special
[29:50] you know I let it get to me
[29:55] but that led me to my ruin as some of
[29:58] you know
[29:59] I was thinking that all these plans were
[30:03] for me
[30:04] I wanted to take authority
[30:08] before time
[30:11] and what do you do when you find out
[30:15] what's in your future
[30:18] but it's not gonna happen yet
[30:23] what David did he went back to serve his
[30:27] father
[30:29] to serve his brother
[30:31] and even sir
[30:35] he was faithful in the future
[30:39] does that make sense
[30:43] if you have questions ask me later
[30:47] now saw here was developing a pride
[30:51] issue
[30:55] and he's beginning to resent David here
[30:59] and he begins resenting him because the
[31:02] people were saying
[31:06] his thousands
[31:09] David has ten thousands
[31:12] and what what happens
[31:14] and bitterness or Envy
[31:18] Saul tries to kill his uh kill David
[31:24] whom now was his enemy
[31:27] enemy for jealousy foreign
[31:52] comes in where he tries to throw a spear
[31:54] at David
[31:59] now what if someone threw a spear at you
[32:04] what if someone did something bad to you
[32:07] or somebody spoke about your family
[32:11] or somebody spoke about your pastor amen
[32:15] I know somebody about your brother
[32:17] what about if they spoke about your
[32:20] children or your wife
[32:22] what's the common thing to do and
[32:39] but instead of that ESO when the spear
[32:43] was thrown at David
[32:46] still honors his his King David
[32:51] that God asked him to serve
[32:55] he doesn't throw the spirit back instead
[33:00] and said he runs to Jonathan Saul's son
[33:05] and tells Jonathan about his father's
[33:09] jealousy
[33:14] but now watch if David threw that Spear
[33:19] and Jonathan didn't know what happened
[33:24] he would have had two enemies
[33:31] this would have been a succession of bad
[33:34] Deeds
[33:35] [Music]
[33:36] but instead he got an ally with
[34:28] this king is
[34:33] mad he tried to kill me
[34:37] and the Lord has anointed me so I'm
[34:39] gonna be king anyways
[34:43] but he didn't do that until God saw fits
[34:49] to give him the kingdom amen
[34:52] now how many of us
[34:54] have taken Authority
[34:57] before it's given to us
[35:01] and that's what David didn't do yes
[35:05] David didn't take authority
[35:08] before God gave it to him
[35:11] and even more admirable
[35:15] was when uh David had opportunities to
[35:18] kill saws
[35:21] David refused
[35:24] because blessed are the peacemakers
[35:31] and David would even saying
[35:39] touch my hand against saw okay
[35:43] but even he even said against the Lord's
[35:46] anointed
[35:49] he was respecting the authority
[35:53] and how our pastor has been saying
[35:57] to receive Authority
[36:00] it must be under Authority
[36:03] and David on the other hand he's humble
[36:06] [Music]
[36:08] and submits to authorities
[36:11] he stays faithful to everything
[36:15] that God called him
[36:18] and now in closing
[36:21] I'd like to share this uh saying
[36:25] I forgot who says this but they say
[36:29] they say don't let your success get to
[36:32] your head
[36:36] or your failure go to your heart Corazon
[36:42] can I repeat that
[36:44] don't let your success get to your
[36:47] hearts
[36:49] forgive me don't let your success get to
[36:51] your head right
[36:53] or your failure gets your hearts
[36:58] David got anointed
[37:01] it could have gone to his head
[37:04] he said I'm living this ship
[37:08] I'm anointed
[37:10] I'm green light to be king yes
[37:14] but he stood under Authority
[37:17] amen amen
[37:19] Authority cannot be taken
[37:23] it must be given
[37:25] so many times we miss out on God
[37:31] we miss out on God's blessings
[37:35] or we don't get everything God wants to
[37:38] bless us with
[37:49] and something to meditate about
[37:53] I'd like to close with this uh quote
[37:56] from our brother brand name
[37:59] and it says in the message why little
[38:02] Bethlehem is
[38:05] says another great event that I wouldn't
[38:07] forget to call
[38:12] that was when David was in his worst of
[38:15] time
[38:16] when he was a fugitive
[38:20] he'd already been anointed
[38:26] he was to be king God said so
[38:30] and yet he was hated
[38:32] he was standing between two great deep
[38:35] fires
[38:38] here was the Philistines on one side
[38:40] after him okay
[38:42] here was Saul on the other side
[38:46] and he was a man without a nation
[38:53] a man without a nation
[38:57] how rejected
[39:01] just as the church stands today
[39:04] the true Living Church of God
[39:08] without a denomination or anything else
[39:13] she stands alone
[39:16] she stands alone
[39:19] they should make us excited brother
[39:23] but yeah she's had the anointing port on
[39:27] her
[39:35] it says she knows where she is
[39:39] but let's all say this together
[39:42] I know what I am
[39:46] the bride knows what she is
[39:49] and just one more quote unasitamas
[39:54] I it's only one sentence
[40:00] it's only one sentence
[40:03] it says what a beautiful picture that is
[40:06] of Christ today okay
[40:10] a fugitive
[40:12] Christ of fugitive today
[40:16] and Christ is rejected the Holy Ghost is
[40:21] rejected
[40:23] like a fugitive trying to hide somewhere
[40:29] knocking here and there
[40:31] knocking at the hearts
[40:34] like a fugitive
[40:36] it says that was Christ on the outside
[40:40] of the church knocking
[40:44] trying to get back in his own church
[40:50] God bless you Brothers
[40:54] [Applause]
[41:01] the Lord bless you Brothers
[41:03] ten

[41:25] this

[41:31] is faithful also and much
[41:40] isn't just awesome
[41:51] who will commit to you trust the true
[41:53] riches
[41:56] and if you have not been faithful in
[41:58] that which is another man
[42:00] who shall give you that which is your
[42:02] own
[42:05] no serving can serve to Masters
[42:09] for he will either hate you
[42:12] love the other yes
[42:18] or else he will hold to the Oneness
[42:21] you cannot serve God
[42:24] and Mammon
[42:30] curios
[42:34] may God help us Brothers

[43:00] things
[43:04] to great things
[43:07] a small factor is going to take you to
[43:11] the greater things
[43:13] that's why I believe that God chose it
[43:15] is
[43:36] foreign
[44:36] tonight
[44:59] tonight
[45:05] I don't know how many Davis there are
[45:07] tonight

[45:16] men that feel like they're too great
[45:23] by the people Brothers

[45:32] he was a young man
[45:34] he was a small
[45:38] now

[46:22] amen brothers
[46:24] and the little things
[46:27] they're gonna take you to great things
[46:31] amen Brothers now
[46:35] hey
[46:38] I'm going to read this message
[46:42] priest in 1963.
[46:48] but so many people like to say
[46:50] I belong
[46:53] but that's not the question
[46:58] that's not the policy that I'm talking
[47:01] about this morning and I tell you
[47:03] tonight it's
[47:05] eternal life
[47:07] everlasting life
[47:19] never begins
[47:28] is to receive eternal life
[47:40] [Music]
[48:02] and you become a part of God
[49:02] what's going on with you
[49:28] I hope to get to this point but look
[49:32] David David
[49:36] he could see God in Simplicity
[49:39] because he was obedient
[49:44] he was a man after God's Own Heart
[49:48] it was the election of God
[49:51] Hermanos
[49:53] usted and look Brothers
[49:55] you are an election of God
[49:58] you didn't choose God
[50:00] I want you to know
[50:03] that you are the election of God
[50:06] because God chose
[50:09] and that's why we struggle
[50:11] is because we didn't choose God so God
[50:15] chose us
[50:16] God chose David
[50:19] and because God chose him
[50:22] that God had elections
[50:30] when he was caring for a sheep
[50:34] [Music]
[50:51] foreign
[51:07] amen Brothers
[51:10] now the story doesn't end a bear also
[51:14] came
[51:15] to try and take one of his sheep and
[51:18] what happened brothers
[51:21] who killed that bear as well
[51:27] it didn't stop there either
[51:30] they continue to advance
[51:35] because of all the brothers that I
[51:37] preach the story to us
[51:39] that when uh Samuel went to go annoying
[51:41] foreign
[52:23] oh see
[52:25] see yes

[1:02:38] Uno so
[1:02:41] David said into Saul the servant keeps
[1:02:44] kept his father's sheep and there came a
[1:02:46] lion and a bear and took a lamb out of
[1:02:48] the flock
[1:03:00] foreign and I went out after him and
[1:03:03] smote him and delivered it out of his
[1:03:04] mouth and when he arose against me I
[1:03:06] caught him by his beard and smote him
[1:03:07] and slew him
[1:03:19] the service flew both The Lion and the
[1:03:22] bear and this is uncircumcised
[1:03:23] Philistine shall be as one of them
[1:03:24] seeing he had defied the armies of the
[1:03:27] Living God is
[1:03:43] David said moreover the Lord that
[1:03:45] delivered me out of the Paw of the lion
[1:03:47] and out of the power of the bear he will
[1:03:48] deliver me out of the hand of this
[1:03:50] Philistine and Saul said unto David go
[1:03:52] and the Lord be with thee
[1:03:54] is
[1:04:05] the pregunta

[1:04:13] for who has despised the day of small
[1:04:15] things

[1:04:22] when he faced the the Goliath right
[1:04:28] I'm not going to repeat it
[1:04:36] before that fight what was David doing
[1:04:40] who was David
[1:04:42] was dedicated
[1:04:53] they were in the army they were soldiers
[1:05:05] um
[1:05:31] and this was the story
[1:05:34] oh
[1:05:47] [Music]
[1:05:51] identification
[1:05:55] he knew the nature of the enemies
[1:06:08] that's just one let them take it
[1:06:11] but he began to think I believe and said
[1:06:14] buenos
[1:06:17] and I don't give him a fight
[1:06:20] he's going to come tomorrow
[1:06:44] and keep those sheep foreign
[1:07:47] of a story that our co-workers shared
[1:07:50] with me this is
[1:07:54] he said that there was this young man
[1:07:56] that went to the pastor and said I want
[1:07:57] to get baptized
[1:07:59] Pastor said okay that's fine
[1:08:02] um uh classes no classes they they did
[1:08:06] some studies
[1:08:08] in order for him to learn what the
[1:08:10] baptism was
[1:08:12] they said he got out of the drugs yeah
[1:08:18] days prior to him being baptized they
[1:08:22] said he went to the Past he said pastor
[1:08:24] he said pastor he said
[1:08:30] another uh some more marijuana
[1:08:35] said no you shoot it
[1:08:39] he continued insisting
[1:08:47] let me have just a little bit more
[1:08:48] no you can't you shouldn't and he
[1:08:52] continued to continue until the pastor
[1:08:55] told him
[1:08:56] that's fine smoke that joint but do it
[1:09:00] where God doesn't see him
[1:09:13] whether it be good or bad
[1:09:17] Oh Glory
[1:09:21] God saw
[1:09:23] that David was faithful to his work
[1:09:27] he tells David
[1:09:30] you know before I use you more
[1:09:33] before I do great things
[1:09:37] put you in a small test or trouble
[1:09:40] I have great things for you

[1:10:49] the the small things
[1:10:54] one of the preaches he was preaching to

[1:11:03] season yes it was it was not in a very
[1:11:06] good condition
[1:11:07] maybe in a cold
[1:11:09] but he said that he said there was no
[1:11:12] Revival there
[1:11:14] was the small things they weren't doing

[1:43:51] I give thanks to God
[1:43:59] one thing about David
[1:44:02] is there many identify with them
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:10] the passage will identify with David
[1:44:13] because he was a pastor
[1:44:16] for those who like to fight
[1:44:20] identify with David
[1:44:24] 's fugitives
[1:44:27] identify with David
[1:44:32] leaders will identify with David
[1:44:36] okay
[1:44:40] is there something that David did more
[1:44:42] than any other thing is that he was a
[1:44:44] worshiper
[1:44:47] is
[1:44:51] where the Isaac said there was
[1:44:52] 60-something books about David
[1:44:53] [Music]
[1:44:57] there's more than 100 songs that from
[1:45:00] David
[1:45:01] contributing to David
[1:45:05] so David was something
[1:45:07] it was a worshiper
[1:45:12] I believe we can all identify with that
[1:45:14] part of David
[1:45:16] that in the battles
[1:45:19] he worshiped God
[1:45:20] and the problems
[1:45:23] we worship God
[1:45:25] the defeats he worshiped God
[1:45:29] it was never too important
[1:45:32] it was never too important
[1:45:36] it was never too great
[1:45:40] to come in New York before God
[1:45:44] and worship him
[1:45:48] [Music]
[1:45:50] once again that's how I just put those
[1:45:52] avids so they they be to God for The
[1:45:55] Davids
[1:45:57] worship him with all his heart
[1:45:59] we don't who aren't afraid
[1:46:02] [Music]
[1:46:03] to show who they are
[1:46:06] who their God is
[1:46:09] say I know who my God is
[1:46:15] who can say I know who my God is
[1:46:21] I may not I may not be sure
[1:46:28] the potential God has given me
[1:46:31] but I know who my God is
[1:46:35] I know who he is
[1:46:40] [Music]
[1:46:41] Big Lot
[1:46:45] [Music]
[1:46:48] when he talked about the lion and the
[1:46:51] Bears
[1:46:52] he was boasting of his God
[1:46:55] he was having a testimony service
