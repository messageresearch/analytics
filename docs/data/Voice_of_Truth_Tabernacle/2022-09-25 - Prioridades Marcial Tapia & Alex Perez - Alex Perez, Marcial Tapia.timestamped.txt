[33:03] esta is
[33:17] saying this is the word of the Lord unto
[33:19] cerebral bell saying now by might nor by

[33:25] hosts
[33:46] have laid the foundation of his house
[33:49] his hands shall also finish it and thou
[33:51] shalt know that the Lord of hosts shall
[33:53] has sent me unto you
[34:02] the reading of his word you may be
[34:04] seated
[34:08] you see here that the hands of Sarah
[34:10] Babel were to lay the foundations
[34:18] they would know that the Lord of hosts
[34:21] had sent him
[34:23] so we see here Brothers
[34:28] it was the hands of zerube
[34:31] he was going to do a work question
[34:36] it was an effort I was going to be going
[34:41] to take
[34:43] to construct to build it
[34:47] in our time
[34:49] foreign
[35:49] Pueblo
[36:49] so
[37:01] look when I win
[37:03] expectations I wasn't going with Greg
[37:06] I would hear our passes
[37:22] foreign
[38:55] and it doesn't matter how many times
[39:02] and he won't be able to
[39:04] because foreign
[39:25] Hallelujah
[40:04] [Applause]
[40:07] foreign
[41:22] because
[41:27] it belongs to God
[41:55] [Music]
[42:03] correct me if I'm wrong
[42:08] he will speak on the Beatitudes
[42:12] he
[42:16] though
[42:24] a multitude of people
[42:30] okay your words
[43:07] this morning
[43:29] but look Brothers
[43:31] foreign
[43:59] hum
[45:00] look Brothers
[45:04] I didn't say the title again priorities
[45:08] priorities in our lives
[45:10] the reason why I didn't say it is
[45:15] but there are priorities
[45:17] we have priorities
[45:39] and we go
[45:41] like the like the dead like the Dead Sea
[45:46] one gets into the sea you just float
[45:50] you don't have to uh you don't is
[45:55] make you float
[45:58] I explained myself
[46:03] do you understand you understand me
[46:07] what I'm trying to tell you is
[46:27] very soon
[46:30] [Music]
[46:38] that's the way it was created is
[46:52] you can receive it or find it
[46:55] my question is
[46:58] how do we find our spiritual lives
[47:15] it doesn't go very well
[47:18] the only one that goes through things
[47:24] these are fundamental things
[47:50] he should be our priority
[47:56] glory to God
[48:01] what happens is
[48:05] priorities aren't according to the word
[48:07] of God
[48:11] that's why we feel like we're dying many
[48:13] times
[48:16] but look Brothers
[48:19] a
[48:21] um
[48:26] I humbly say this
[48:29] is
[48:32] how it was built
[48:37] please God to be there
[48:42] we know who built the first Tabernacle
[48:47] it was it was the temples the Solomon
[48:53] salomonos destroyed by
[48:56] Babylonia by the people of Babylon
[49:00] he is
[49:02] that's what the devil does
[49:05] he wants to destroy this Temple is
[49:09] that's what the devil's been trying to
[49:12] do is destroy this Temple
[49:15] the one would get filthy is
[49:22] it begins
[49:25] one begins to destroy yourself
[49:32] because we allow
[49:55] not just anything
[50:02] I chose
[50:07] your priorities
[50:33] Nintendo
[51:33] yes
[53:30] because we have to Die daily
[54:09] what he did
[54:49] because their priorities
[55:38] so many things
[55:41] that's normal
[55:53] remember children of God
[55:58] in the last days
[56:00] [Applause]
[56:05] he wants to be our best friend
[56:10] orita
[56:13] I was honestly speaking right now
[56:18] you have a friend
[56:20] on what he knows and how he directs it
[56:24] is
[56:25] one wants to have that contact
[56:28] recognition
[56:29] who wants to have a dumb friend who
[56:33] doesn't know anything
[56:36] nobody I mean it's difficile it's
[56:39] difficult
[56:42] but people want to have friendships
[56:45] somebody that knows a lot
[56:48] and the devil knows a lot
[56:51] but at the same time he doesn't know
[56:53] anything
[56:55] he knows a lot yeah he doesn't know
[56:57] anything
[56:58] foreign
[57:33] God bless you
[57:40] uh
[57:55] chapter 1 verse 3 says like this
[58:01] then came the word of the Lord by
[58:04] Haggard The Prophet saying
[58:06] Tiempo
[58:08] para vosotros de avitar embuestras Casas
[58:12] artesonadas
[58:13] is
[58:16] it time for you or you to dwell in your
[58:18] sealed houses
[58:20] and this house lie waste
[58:22] uh
[58:26] I like how the New Living Translation
[58:28] States it you say s
[58:37] vien
[58:47] OS
[58:50] this is another for us that the Lord of
[58:52] hosts consider your ways
[59:01] is
[59:12] you have so much in bringing little you
[59:15] eat but you have not enough you drink
[59:17] but you are not filled with drink you
[59:19] clothe you but there is none warm and he
[59:22] that Earnest wages earns wages to put it
[59:25] into a bag with holes
[59:29] terrible picture we just read
[59:38] does that the Lord consider your ways
[59:43] I want to read one more scripture
[59:45] apocalypse is Revelations 19 verse 7.
[59:53] Gloria
[59:55] Las bodas Del Cordero is
[1:00:00] let us be glad and rejoiced and give
[1:00:03] honor to him for the marriage of the
[1:00:04] Lamb has come and his wife hath made
[1:00:07] herself ready
[1:00:09] I'd like to begin by asking you
[1:00:12] guess importante cuando estamos en Los
[1:00:16] ultimos Diaz what is important when
[1:00:18] we're in the last days
[1:00:22] we lived as if he comes tomorrow
[1:00:25] what would I change
[1:00:29] what would matter in our in your lives
[1:00:34] we knew Jesus was coming tomorrow
[1:00:38] what value would your belongings have
[1:00:41] what priorities
[1:00:49] they be the same if you knew Jesus was
[1:00:51] coming tomorrow
[1:01:01] be worth the same tomorrow if you knew
[1:01:03] Jesus was coming
[1:01:08] things that we fight and defend
[1:01:12] ERS
[1:01:19] you stand for those same things if you
[1:01:21] knew Jesus was coming tomorrow
[1:01:23] we
[1:01:37] ought to be living as if Jesus died
[1:01:39] yesterday
[1:01:41] Rose this morning
[1:01:44] coming back this afternoon
[1:01:48] [Music]
[1:01:54] it is rebuking the people of Israel
[1:01:58] and it's because their mentality
[1:02:01] their focus and priorities
[1:02:06] edifying or building a luxurious house
[1:02:08] with himself
[1:02:19] and it was deserted
[1:02:22] in other words
[1:02:30] to the priorities of God
[1:02:34] the people of Israel for this time
[1:02:40] what God wanted them to do
[1:02:43] it was totally different
[1:02:50] what is the priority is
[1:02:53] what we will do first
[1:02:59] our time money and efforts
[1:03:03] those are our priorities
[1:03:16] I'll tell you where you your priorities
[1:03:19] are man that's correct come on
[1:03:24] guys says
[1:03:27] thus said the Lord
[1:03:31] meditate upon your ways
[1:03:49] to analyze where our ways are my
[1:03:54] name
[1:03:55] you know the word stop
[1:03:59] what you're doing
[1:04:01] much
[1:04:06] but we're not bringing anything good
[1:04:13] it means it means you're doing God's
[1:04:15] will
[1:04:16] is
[1:04:20] working on their own things
[1:04:23] [Applause]
[1:04:26] he wasn't what God wanted
[1:04:35] that you're in the perfect will of God
[1:04:38] you could be blessed
[1:04:41] and have Allah
[1:04:53] Jeremiah chapter 6 verses
[1:04:59] in the ways
[1:05:05] oh wait
[1:05:10] yeah

[1:05:38] tremendous
[1:05:40] and you shall find Descanso rest
[1:05:43] for your souls
[1:05:47] a person that is
[1:05:56] countries
[1:06:21] [Applause]
[1:06:30] that God is with them
[1:06:40] we will not walk therein
[1:06:43] which is many times the reasons
[1:06:46] there's no rest in our lives
[1:06:49] because we're not doing it
[1:06:55] because we're we're doing what really
[1:06:57] has no value
[1:07:00] and it could benefit our own lives
[1:07:04] we don't find peace
[1:07:08] because there's there's no there's no
[1:07:11] reward or value
[1:07:14] Galatians 6 verse 8 says
[1:07:18] foreign
[1:07:50] Everlasting
[1:08:03] yes
[1:08:06] for ourselves
[1:08:17] but you think that what you're investing
[1:08:19] in is
[1:08:21] that will last in your life wow
[1:08:28] I want to tell you
[1:08:31] that the benefits
[1:08:39] for this world
[1:08:59] say that again benefits
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:21] come on Richard
[1:09:25] s now when you talk about priorities
[1:09:31] the Christian is no different than the
[1:09:34] unbelievers they both have priorities
[1:09:38] it's impossible to live without having
[1:09:41] priorities
[1:09:45] and because of that
[1:09:50] decisions are taken
[1:09:54] a person that has
[1:10:01] according to their priorities
[1:10:15] third place
[1:10:18] it's not wrong Brothers
[1:10:23] to invest in things
[1:10:26] but we're talking about priorities
[1:10:30] my priority means first
[1:10:37] what's the third place in your life
[1:10:52] was forsaken
[1:11:00] um
[1:11:02] the whole world has to make decisions
[1:11:12] in the way that the impact
[1:11:42] he wants to be here
[1:11:55] [Applause]
[1:11:57] I know he's first
[1:12:07] now remember
[1:12:15] may not be the importance that you give
[1:12:17] it
[1:12:28] and you could care less about it
[1:12:34] it goes on the basis of what your
[1:12:36] priorities are Israel in this trip to
[1:12:39] Israel
[1:12:40] is very costly
[1:12:44] how do you create money out of nothing
[1:12:47] I just all I need to do is
[1:12:51] ready and go to Israel
[1:12:55] it was
[1:12:59] something I wanted to do
[1:13:05] Marcos
[1:13:06] Mark chapter 10.
[1:13:11] you know it
[1:13:13] is
[1:13:18] loved him speaking of the richest
[1:13:28] foreign
[1:14:20] in this place
[1:14:23] they're two vastly different things
[1:14:32] Luke chapter 2 verse 49.
[1:14:35] and he said unto them
[1:14:39] I like how Jesus had very had defined
[1:14:44] his priorities
[1:14:47] he knew why he had come to this earth
[1:14:51] watch what Jesus
[1:15:01] Jesus is speaking at the 12 years of age
[1:15:07] that I must be about my father's
[1:15:10] business
[1:15:15] this Earth
[1:15:18] priorities
[1:15:28] but they did not understand
[1:15:31] um which he's taken to them
[1:15:34] a person has priorities in their lives
[1:15:39] many people will not understand
[1:15:43] don't have your priorities
[1:15:46] they won't understand you
[1:15:49] attitude
[1:15:52] not be understood
[1:15:55] simply because your priorities
[1:16:05] because we are priorities
[1:16:20] you want to lay up Treasures in Heaven
[1:16:24] I already said the rest of the people
[1:16:33] everything will be added on to you
[1:16:37] this trip to Israel
[1:16:40] I learned a lot
[1:16:43] I was able to see where Jesus walked
[1:16:45] whatever
[1:16:50] I was able to see where
[1:16:57] UMES in the mountains
[1:16:59] in the isolated places
[1:17:04] one thing that stood out to me
[1:17:07] is how a people
[1:17:10] listen how a people is
[1:17:13] awaiting their Messiah
[1:17:16] they are prepared
[1:17:19] they pray three times a day
[1:17:24] implementations three times a week
[1:17:27] Eagles
[1:17:36] everything is ready
[1:17:38] and they don't have a temple yet
[1:17:51] and they are prepared
[1:17:56] and for people
[1:17:59] there's a way in there
[1:18:02] can be prepared
[1:18:04] much more us
[1:18:06] questions
[1:18:13] [Applause]
[1:18:24] have our priorities in order
[1:18:31] they know the people
[1:18:34] Revelations
[1:18:46] of the true church
[1:18:49] and what she is
[1:18:54] she stands foreign

[1:21:00] but that's up to you

[1:21:14] because you don't want to be delivered
[1:21:19] foreign
[1:21:36] all right that's right
[1:21:40] that depends on you
[1:21:43] you have to do something as well
[1:21:55] you have a power to do it

[1:23:24] the hardest way
[1:23:28] nobody's obligating us Brothers
[1:23:33] God reminds us this morning
[1:23:39] edify something that endures
[1:23:42] it has to be much
[1:23:48] the world has to offer
[1:23:53] I want things that endure
[1:23:55] yeah
[1:23:59] I have to make my own decisions
[1:24:06] many of us haven't made a clear decision
[1:24:09] yet
[1:24:11] what it is that we want to do for God
[1:24:16] but it's not everything
[1:24:19] there's a lot more Brothers
