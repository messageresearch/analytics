[33:09] open up
[33:10] your
[33:12] in the book of St John chapter
[33:17] 1 be reading from verse 31 and
[33:22] on God bless everyone here in this
[33:25] place
[33:27] if there's someone here it's the first
[33:29] time here may God bless
[33:37] you the theme that we're taking on
[33:41] Sundays fighting for the
[33:46] souls and along with my brother
[33:50] Fel chosen the
[33:53] subtitle that we've
[33:55] titled
[34:00] convinced and then
[34:05] worried scripture you can say Amen we
[34:07] can begin
[34:11] reading John chapter 1 verse 3
[34:16] 31 the scripture says like
[34:25] this
[34:35] verse 32 says and John bear record
[34:37] saying I saw the Spirit descending from
[34:39] heaven like a dove and it Abode upon
[34:55] him
[35:02] and I knew him not but he that s me to
[35:05] baptize with water the same said unto me
[35:07] upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit
[35:09] descending and remaining on him the same
[35:11] is he which baptizeth with the Holy
[35:23] Ghost and I saw and bear record that
[35:26] this is is the Son of
[35:33] God again the next day after John stood
[35:35] and two of his
[35:45] disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he
[35:47] walked he saith Behold the Lamb of
[35:55] God and the two disciples heard him and
[35:58] heard him speak and they followed
[36:14] Jesus then Jesus turned and saw them
[36:16] following and saith unto them what seek
[36:18] ye they said unto him Rabbi which is to
[36:20] say being interpreted Master where
[36:23] dwellest
[36:25] thou
[36:39] he saith unto them come and see they
[36:41] came and saw where he dwelt and Abode
[36:43] with him that day for it was about the
[36:45] 10th
[36:55] hour one of the two which heard John
[36:58] speak and followed him was Andrew Simon
[37:00] Peter's
[37:11] brother he first findeth his own brother
[37:14] Simon and saith unto him we have found
[37:16] the Messiah which is being interpreted
[37:18] the
[37:20] Christ the bless word you may be
[37:25] seated
[37:30] John the
[37:34] Baptist a couple days
[37:40] before he had experienced the greatest
[37:43] Revelation he had had in his
[37:48] life God had prepared him for 30
[37:51] years to use him for six
[37:55] months
[38:00] God had given him a an experience that
[38:02] was
[38:05] Unforgettable to be able to introduce
[38:07] the
[38:09] Messiah to be able to see that great
[38:14] Revelation the Holy Ghost come down as a
[38:18] dove and to rest upon
[38:22] him it was a marvelous time for John
[38:28] he had fulfilled his
[38:31] purpose John was so
[38:34] happy that he knew within
[38:37] himself that he had
[38:41] fulfilled his calling for which God had
[38:43] called
[38:48] him when John was here on
[38:52] Earth he had
[38:55] followers
[38:57] people followed
[39:01] John and amongst that Gathering of
[39:03] followers that John
[39:08] had there were two disciples there as
[39:11] the Bible
[39:13] narrates one of them was
[39:17] Andrew and brother Bram says that the
[39:19] other one was
[39:22] Phillip and they followed John the
[39:24] Baptist and
[39:27] and they in
[39:29] fact were
[39:32] present when John has this great
[39:35] Revelation and he
[39:38] says Behold the Lamb of God that taketh
[39:41] away the sin of the
[39:42] world they were
[39:44] there they were
[39:47] present but as the
[39:50] Revelation was not for
[39:52] them the Revelation was for
[39:55] John
[39:57] and that captures my attention that
[39:59] every man every
[40:02] woman has to have their experience
[40:05] personal
[40:09] experience brother brandham
[40:14] says convinced then
[40:19] concerned uh speaking of that experience
[40:21] John
[40:23] had nobody else saw it
[40:27] but
[40:29] John just think of
[40:31] [Music]
[40:33] that the Holy Spirit came down in the
[40:35] form of a
[40:37] dust and rested Upon
[40:40] Jesus and nobody
[40:43] saw but
[40:47] John because the promise was made to
[40:50] John so then we see a
[40:53] man named John the Baptist
[40:57] who has his
[40:58] Revelation who has his
[41:01] experience he had seen the
[41:04] Messiah recognized who the Messiah
[41:08] was but there were two
[41:11] disciples that wanted their own
[41:14] experience as well and I want to tell
[41:16] you this
[41:18] morning that you and
[41:20] I we can't
[41:23] live on the revelation of someone else
[41:27] I can't live on my pastor's
[41:30] Revelation I can't live on the
[41:32] revelation of someone else I
[41:34] need an
[41:36] experience a firsthand
[41:42] experience brother Bram
[41:45] says
[41:48] we don't want a a
[41:51] religion is
[41:53] second-handed no
[41:55] brothers
[41:57] I don't want a
[41:59] religion I don't want to live in church
[42:02] just because they tell me just because
[42:05] they tell me that Jesus died for
[42:06] me that God sent a prophet in my time I
[42:10] need you
[42:12] need to make
[42:14] sure to be
[42:16] convinced that this is for
[42:25] you
[42:28] something that somebody else has
[42:30] experienced brother Bram
[42:31] says John the
[42:34] Baptist had had his
[42:36] Revelation his
[42:38] experience but there were two
[42:41] disciples that they stayed with
[42:44] that they had that
[42:47] curiosity is that man named
[42:52] Jesus if this
[42:54] morning there' be people this morning
[42:57] that
[42:59] say I want to have my own
[43:03] experience I need to know this man named
[43:08] Jesus brother Bram continues
[43:14] saying and we are living off of their
[43:18] testimony we said a couple weeks
[43:21] back speaking on the Apostle
[43:23] PA that he came with the testimony of
[43:27] God came and spoke of that testim he
[43:30] came and
[43:32] said what God had
[43:35] done God had sent
[43:37] Jesus to Die For
[43:40] Humanity it was a
[43:43] testimony John had spoken of the
[43:45] testimony that he had
[43:49] experienced there was a man named
[43:51] andreww needed his own
[43:55] experience his own experience his own
[43:59] testimony we can't
[44:01] live on the experience of our
[44:05] brother this takes
[44:08] me to think on
[44:14] Andrew you know that Andrew was the
[44:16] first disciple of
[44:18] Jesus registered here in the
[44:20] Bible it shows that he was one of the
[44:24] first that follow
[44:32] Jesus and it catches my attention how
[44:34] these two
[44:36] disciples they asked
[44:40] Jesus where do you
[44:43] dwell there was a certain curiosity in
[44:48] them they wanted to know more about
[44:52] Jesus the world wants to know more about
[44:54] Jesus
[44:59] that I don't have the time nor the uh do
[45:01] I put in the effort to show more of
[45:04] Jesus we said a couple weeks back that
[45:06] the
[45:08] people they just don't want to just
[45:11] hear they don't want to just hear
[45:13] words we have to take him out of
[45:16] history and present him now and
[45:24] days and in the mind of
[45:28] Andrew there was that Curiosity that
[45:31] little that little
[45:34] Splinter and it's uh beautiful when a
[45:40] person follow in advance and what they
[45:42] truly feel in their
[45:44] heart I tell every one of
[45:47] you if you have the desire to seek more
[45:49] of God then do
[45:51] it don't let anything stop you don't let
[45:55] anything hold you back
[45:57] don't hold yourself
[45:59] back don't worry about how you're going
[46:01] to come
[46:03] Church speak to a people that knows
[46:07] come you're
[46:09] welcome there are words of
[46:11] life there are words that we want to
[46:13] share with
[46:14] you on behalf of
[46:16] God that God still wants to deal with
[46:24] us this takes me
[46:28] to What My Title
[46:32] is I realized that
[46:36] Andrew was a person that had to be
[46:40] convinced so that he could
[46:44] later so that he could later be
[46:48] worried you see I was looking a little
[46:51] bit I
[46:54] seen I was
[46:58] looking what kind of worries do people
[47:01] have for this new upcoming
[47:05] year and one of the worries if you allow
[47:12] me the people that are running for the
[47:15] presidency they're
[47:18] worried that the people are going to
[47:20] believe and they can make a great
[47:24] case
[47:26] people can say that's going to be my
[47:30] president people are
[47:33] worried to be able to find the
[47:37] way in which the people might believe
[47:40] and that they'll vote for
[47:45] them there are people that are worried
[47:47] about the economy what's going to
[47:50] happen what's going to
[47:54] happen is going to go up down there is a
[47:58] lot of worry that that is
[48:02] upcoming there's a
[48:05] YouTuber there youth here you'll
[48:07] understand
[48:10] me he is so worried that his ratings are
[48:13] for his ratings to go
[48:15] up that he's willing to do
[48:18] anything any dumb
[48:21] thing for the people to say
[48:23] wow he is worried
[48:27] to gain a a a greater following this is
[48:30] the time that we're living there is
[48:34] worries but for the things that don't
[48:36] aren't
[48:38] important as our
[48:40] pastor things that are in fact
[48:43] dead at the end of it all they are
[48:49] death there are fathers head of families
[48:51] that don't know what to do with their
[48:52] kids that's one of the
[48:54] worries their are fathers and mothers
[48:57] that they don't know what to
[48:59] do they're
[49:05] worried there are families that are on
[49:07] the brink of
[49:08] divorce and they're
[49:12] thinking who's going to stay with the
[49:14] house and who's going to have the
[49:21] car if you look up uh worries of 2024
[49:25] that they show up on
[49:26] Google people need to hear a
[49:31] person that is
[49:33] convinced of what they're
[49:39] believing I asked
[49:42] myself am I truly convinced because you
[49:45] know what
[49:47] church the truth of the matter is that
[49:50] they don't
[49:51] believe truly not
[49:54] convinced Tru
[49:56] believe we're
[50:04] confessing and this left me a little
[50:06] stumbling a little
[50:11] bit people are worrying so much about
[50:14] many
[50:15] things I remember the story of
[50:17] Jesus when he was 12 years
[50:21] old his parents were
[50:23] worried because they couldn't find him
[50:27] and you know
[50:28] what the thing that you worry about is
[50:32] what's moving
[50:34] you what worries
[50:38] you if it worries you to pay the
[50:42] bills then I'm going to make sure that I
[50:44] have a good
[50:47] job this the time that we're living
[50:51] in you that's what's going to move you
[50:57] that's why we can't rescue a
[50:59] soul because perhaps they
[51:02] don't and I want to tell you this
[51:04] morning we have to be
[51:07] conv came for a
[51:09] soul it was open to us from the
[51:12] beginning the pastor told
[51:14] us more than 10,000
[51:17] worlds we have to go in and capture that
[51:21] Vision there's a
[51:24] purpose
[51:32] for on
[51:34] a but to fulfill a
[51:38] purpose hallelujah
[51:44] hallelujah you find
[51:47] Jesus and they tell him they find Jesus
[51:49] and he tells
[51:51] us I'm just kind of
[51:54] summarizing what happened
[51:58] Jesus we were so in
[52:01] anguish we have days looking for
[52:04] you and Jesus responds to them and he
[52:08] tells
[52:11] them did you
[52:14] not did you not know that it's necessary
[52:17] for me to be in my father's
[52:20] business I believe brothers that we're
[52:21] getting to the
[52:24] time
[52:26] where we have to find out what truly
[52:28] matters to
[52:30] us I ask you this
[52:33] morning what moves
[52:37] you what moves
[52:44] me I stayed here in worries because
[52:46] people are worrying about so many things
[52:48] right
[52:51] now what church I've
[52:54] realized that nothing can fill
[52:58] us nothing brings more happiness to my
[53:01] soul truly
[53:04] church then when I see a person who is
[53:08] lost and comes to the feet of
[53:12] Jesus yes
[53:15] brothers because that brings me to
[53:17] understand that God is still
[53:21] working he says it's convenient or I
[53:23] must be in my father's business
[53:26] and I
[53:31] realize Andrew had to
[53:34] convince I
[53:36] imagine what Jesus told amongst
[53:39] throughout that whole
[53:44] night to take him to the
[53:48] point that when he comes
[53:51] out Jesus was staying
[53:54] dwelling what he first
[53:57] does is he goes and finds his
[54:02] brother look there is something that
[54:04] happens I
[54:07] believe that there is something that
[54:10] happens when you truly believe
[54:17] something when you truly believe
[54:20] something you're not easily
[54:24] moved
[54:28] and I I begin to think about a lot of
[54:30] people that say that they believe
[54:31] something that they believe the message
[54:33] that they believe this but later on
[54:36] they're not there anymore and I asked
[54:40] myself Tru had a
[54:44] conviction they had something that
[54:47] really anchored
[54:49] them and I say no no perhaps it can't
[54:52] be because when you believe something
[54:56] when you're convinced
[54:57] of you can't stay
[55:00] quiet you can't stay
[55:02] quiet you have to speak you have to
[55:06] share it it doesn't
[55:10] matter yes I believe you no I
[55:13] don't the
[55:16] world is looking for
[55:19] people that
[55:21] believes what they what is being
[55:24] confessed
[55:27] the pastor told us something in the back
[55:29] room there and it's
[55:32] true sometimes we believe more of a
[55:35] lie because they present it in a way
[55:39] that it's the
[55:42] truth and we that have a great
[55:46] truth they convince us just by a little
[55:53] bit Andre
[55:57] Andrew did the
[55:58] same as
[56:01] Paul like we said the previous time the
[56:04] last
[56:05] time Paul went to Arabia Arab to
[56:10] search if his experience was true do you
[56:15] remember and and Andrew he did the
[56:21] same he went with
[56:23] Jesus and he made
[56:27] sure he had to be
[56:29] convinced that that was the
[56:32] truth when you're
[56:35] convinced then you begin to talk to
[56:40] people as our brother Fel comes
[56:43] forward I'd like to just leave you with
[56:46] this with this
[56:49] thought brother Bram
[56:53] says
[56:58] now Andrew became very very
[57:03] concerned because he stayed with him all
[57:07] night and was convinced hallelujah
[57:14] hallelujah and then when he became
[57:16] convinced that he was the
[57:19] [Music]
[57:21] Christ then he was concerned about
[57:24] somebody else
[57:27] I could
[57:29] stop worried and it's fine we're worried
[57:32] about ourselves
[57:34] amen how
[57:49] tremendous and I believe that every man
[57:52] every woman every boy or girl that ever
[57:54] stays long enough that you're
[57:57] convinced we don't stay long
[58:00] enough reation down and we leave oh
[58:04] hallelujah
[58:06] hallelujah and to be convinced that it
[58:09] is
[58:11] right and that the Holy
[58:16] G so hard
[58:18] heart something happens in your
[58:21] heart Revelation com and
[58:25] you're the Holy
[58:28] Ghost
[58:30] Ming burning your
[58:35] heart that you can't stand
[58:39] still and let these people
[58:41] die like
[58:43] this in
[58:45] shame and
[58:48] sin my prayer
[58:50] is that we be
[58:53] convinced first and foremost
[58:58] worry about the lost souls God bless
[59:00] [Applause]
[59:02] you God bless
[59:05] you if it's for him give it even
[59:08] stronger than
[59:09] [Applause]
[59:13] that convinced and then
[59:18] worried we give thanks unto our pastor
[59:20] for the
[59:23] confidence
[59:27] and before talking on what God has
[59:28] placed in our
[59:39] hearts forgive
[59:47] me
[59:49] I there's
[59:52] sometimes sometimes we preach
[1:00:00] like when the when the test that comes
[1:00:02] to test your
[1:00:04] faith that's where it's it's
[1:00:07] tested because we can preach we can
[1:00:12] talk you can preach to
[1:00:15] someone but when the test or
[1:00:19] problem where your faith has to be
[1:00:22] tested my faith has to be
[1:00:27] I have to
[1:00:28] show you got to
[1:00:31] show and who or what you
[1:00:36] have truly convinced in what you have
[1:00:41] believed it's all right what the sister
[1:00:43] or brother have believed that's all
[1:00:45] right
[1:00:47] brother
[1:00:52] brother beautiful
[1:00:56] but the most important thing this
[1:00:58] morning is yours your
[1:01:00] soul if you're
[1:01:03] convinced the devil's trying to convince
[1:01:07] you the devil's trying to fight for your
[1:01:09] soul he's not going to
[1:01:13] stop he's fighting
[1:01:16] 247 trying to convince you he
[1:01:20] wants he wants you to go with
[1:01:23] him
[1:01:28] in this morning what has convinced
[1:01:30] you that's the question we must ask
[1:01:34] ourselves what's con what's conquered us
[1:01:38] what's made us fall in
[1:01:44] love graas thank
[1:01:47] you thank you to our
[1:01:50] pastor to be behind his
[1:01:52] pulpit and thank you to each and every
[1:01:54] one of
[1:01:55] you who is praying for the
[1:01:59] family it's not easy it's difficult
[1:02:05] times I didn't want to come to
[1:02:08] preach like
[1:02:10] humans we have
[1:02:13] feelings because the why does the person
[1:02:16] cry the scriptures teaches
[1:02:20] me when Jesus Christ saw
[1:02:22] Lazarus that the scriptures
[1:02:25] says there's nothing wrong with
[1:02:27] that but now the question
[1:02:31] is what has convinced
[1:02:34] us you know I
[1:02:36] believe for you to fall in love with
[1:02:38] something you have to be
[1:02:42] convinced you want to know why I'm
[1:02:45] here I could have been anywhere
[1:02:48] else you want to know why I'm
[1:02:51] stand because I've been convinced and
[1:02:54] what
[1:02:55] I what I
[1:02:58] preach what I preach I have to live
[1:03:01] it and I can't live out there it's nice
[1:03:04] living out there but here with
[1:03:12] us go God has made me follow with
[1:03:16] him you know he's convinced me I was
[1:03:21] thinking how many times the devil hasn't
[1:03:23] tried to kill me
[1:03:26] and I was remembering
[1:03:29] that the devil has tried to kill me many
[1:03:31] times but he still hasn't
[1:03:34] yet because he hasn't been given the
[1:03:39] permission but I been I started to think
[1:03:41] and think of how many times the devil
[1:03:43] has tried to kill
[1:03:46] me and you start to think how many times
[1:03:48] the devil has tried to kill
[1:03:49] you I was thinking when I was a young
[1:03:52] boyx in Mexico
[1:03:55] one
[1:03:57] time a donkey dragged
[1:03:59] me I was a little
[1:04:02] boy and I wanted to stop the
[1:04:05] donkey and the donkey was with a rope
[1:04:07] around his
[1:04:09] neck and an innocent little boy try to
[1:04:13] stop I want to stop the
[1:04:16] donkey and the Rope was hanging
[1:04:20] down I don't know how but the the the
[1:04:22] cord around leg and took me and he took
[1:04:26] me
[1:04:28] downhill a donkey had didn't have
[1:04:32] brakes it was on and it was on rocks on
[1:04:34] a steep
[1:04:36] hill I don't know what
[1:04:40] happened but that
[1:04:42] rope was made loose from my
[1:04:46] leg I believe it was the angel of the
[1:04:48] Lord right
[1:04:49] there was watching over me in another
[1:04:53] occasion I was drowned in the sea in
[1:04:56] another
[1:04:58] occasion I almost drowned in the river
[1:05:01] in another
[1:05:03] occasion in the hurricane where my
[1:05:05] father passed
[1:05:06] away a week
[1:05:08] before before my father passed away I
[1:05:12] went to go live with my grandmother and
[1:05:14] the hurricane and my father passed away
[1:05:18] God was taking care of
[1:05:20] me
[1:05:21] was God was convincing me
[1:05:26] even though what's inside the Bible it's
[1:05:30] true it has to come to
[1:05:32] life has to come into reality this
[1:05:36] life has to come into reality in my
[1:05:41] life this what the
[1:05:44] gospel has to come into reality in our
[1:05:48] life in another
[1:05:52] occasion the devil
[1:05:55] trying to kill us with my
[1:05:59] uncle my uncle the one that passed away
[1:06:01] last
[1:06:09] night the devil tried to kill me in the
[1:06:16] desert but my God had something planned
[1:06:19] for
[1:06:21] me things didn't end there
[1:06:24] now in this
[1:06:27] morning you may be going through
[1:06:31] problems you maybe go through problems
[1:06:33] in your
[1:06:35] marriage you can be go through family
[1:06:38] problem maybe in a
[1:06:40] job you're
[1:06:43] worried but in this
[1:06:47] morning I believe with all my
[1:06:50] heart because there's balm here
[1:06:55] brother no no it's not
[1:06:58] me it's his
[1:07:01] word he promised
[1:07:03] it and he will fulfill
[1:07:06] it as darkest things may get your life
[1:07:09] may
[1:07:12] get as much as the devil tried to kill
[1:07:16] you car and
[1:07:21] spiritually God still hasn't given him
[1:07:23] permission
[1:07:25] because God is still trying to convince
[1:07:27] you he tries to convince
[1:07:30] you in one occasion there was a woman a
[1:07:34] woman with a blood
[1:07:38] issue she wanted to touch the
[1:07:41] mantle cuz she
[1:07:44] knew she was
[1:07:47] convinced there was no doubt in her
[1:07:50] heart that if she touched the border of
[1:07:52] his m simply by touching it she would be
[1:07:57] healed and she accomplished
[1:08:01] it simply she touched the border of his
[1:08:06] mantle in another
[1:08:09] occasion there was a
[1:08:14] damsel SC
[1:08:16] says she was from this from a place
[1:08:19] called
[1:08:22] Samaria this woman surprises me
[1:08:30] shocks the Samaritan woman gets me a
[1:08:33] little bit
[1:08:34] crazy there's things I don't
[1:08:37] understand like our pastor a while ago
[1:08:41] told there's things that we're not going
[1:08:43] to completely understand there's things
[1:08:45] that I'm not going to
[1:08:49] understand I don't understand why my God
[1:08:51] took my uncle at 56 years old
[1:08:55] full of
[1:08:56] life his heart was
[1:09:00] young that's why he he lasted so long in
[1:09:04] agony because his heart was
[1:09:14] young and this
[1:09:19] woman this captures my
[1:09:22] attention
[1:09:26] the the Lord Jesus Christ said to the
[1:09:27] disciples go through don't go through
[1:09:29] Samaritan ways don't
[1:09:32] go he said to them he said don't
[1:09:36] go but then it
[1:09:38] say oh it's necessary for me it's
[1:09:43] necessary for me to pass
[1:09:45] by our Pastor
[1:09:48] said he wanted to go personally and in
[1:09:52] this morning
[1:09:54] he wants to convince you
[1:09:58] personally he doesn't want you to have a
[1:10:01] second he wants you to be convinced by
[1:10:06] himself that he wants to convince
[1:10:11] you you
[1:10:14] know my
[1:10:18] uncle he preached to me he lived
[1:10:22] me the grace of God we were able to work
[1:10:25] with
[1:10:27] him and I'm happy for
[1:10:29] that but you know one
[1:10:32] thing he is a in a better place he's in
[1:10:35] a better
[1:10:37] place he's no longer in
[1:10:43] pain with that cancer that he
[1:10:46] had he's no longer
[1:10:50] suffering but things don't just stay
[1:10:52] there Brothers
[1:10:56] this
[1:10:58] gospel what he preached to
[1:11:01] me what he liveed to
[1:11:05] me I had to bring it to
[1:11:09] manifestation CU what I can't
[1:11:13] live it's not only what's preached over
[1:11:16] there it goes to
[1:11:18] the it has to come to you take
[1:11:21] it take it in your heart
[1:11:25] grab all to it on your heart with all
[1:11:27] your
[1:11:29] strength and then an experience come to
[1:11:31] your life and then you may say no longer
[1:11:35] do I live but Christ livees within
[1:11:39] me for me to die is
[1:11:44] a not not anybody could say
[1:11:48] that when you're
[1:11:52] certain
[1:11:57] when we're
[1:12:00] convinced but many times we come to
[1:12:04] church we're falling
[1:12:11] asleep you want to know
[1:12:15] why because many things haven't been
[1:12:17] made real to
[1:12:22] us the time
[1:12:26] comes when things come to
[1:12:30] reality we speak of
[1:12:33] death and we say we're going towards
[1:12:37] it but when it comes to
[1:12:42] reality when when you find it or face it
[1:12:45] face to
[1:12:49] face when you find it face to
[1:12:52] face
[1:12:54] many of us are healthy thanks be to
[1:12:59] God when death comes to reality in your
[1:13:03] life it's better yet you be
[1:13:07] convinced today is the
[1:13:10] day if you're not convinced that you
[1:13:12] have the Holy Spirit brother today is
[1:13:15] the
[1:13:16] day that you can't come and take
[1:13:19] it what hinders you what hinders you
[1:13:26] that you take of the Holy Spirit what
[1:13:27] hind you if the word says that
[1:13:32] he shall provide the holy spirit for us
[1:13:36] what
[1:13:37] hinders the word is not the problem
[1:13:41] in that I'm still
[1:13:44] not in
[1:13:52] fullness
[1:13:53] brother Bram says
[1:14:02] this now you you cannot match the
[1:14:08] enemy I'm gonna read you another quote
[1:14:10] look
[1:14:11] look he says you
[1:14:15] know I believe the holy spirit is
[1:14:16] speaking something to us
[1:14:19] here because many of us aren't still
[1:14:22] convinced
[1:14:24] we're convinced of many other things
[1:14:26] many other we're many we're convinced of
[1:14:29] many other
[1:14:32] things but we're convinced of the
[1:14:34] incorrect
[1:14:36] things and brother Fidel you say why do
[1:14:38] you say
[1:14:41] that because we're we're we're read
[1:14:45] letters written
[1:14:49] letters you may deceive the brother or
[1:14:52] sister
[1:14:57] but look there's a spirit within
[1:14:59] you which happens to be this the
[1:15:01] conscience as
[1:15:03] well the day that you depart from
[1:15:07] here that that Spirit goes back to the
[1:15:10] father but that same
[1:15:13] Spirit be in the
[1:15:15] conscience the day of
[1:15:17] judgment will
[1:15:22] come and will come and expose all things
[1:15:25] to
[1:15:29] you those that's for those that have
[1:15:31] died without Christ in their
[1:15:34] hearts that's for those that are still
[1:15:37] not yet convinced but if in this
[1:15:40] morning you're
[1:15:42] convinced and you know in your
[1:15:45] heart you're
[1:15:47] rooted like when the storms
[1:15:51] come and that boat
[1:15:55] that has that anchor well anchored deep
[1:16:00] deep as
[1:16:03] high go to the left and to the
[1:16:06] right the devil shakes them from left to
[1:16:10] right tears down trees
[1:16:14] way but this boat shall
[1:16:17] remain your boat shall
[1:16:20] remain because you've been convinced
[1:16:29] the prophet says you know what what I
[1:16:34] believe I I believe that people are not
[1:16:37] convinced that Jesus is coming
[1:16:41] soon oh that hit
[1:16:45] me God hit me right
[1:16:51] there I believe that people are are not
[1:16:55] convinced that he's coming in this
[1:17:01] age we say oh yes especially when we're
[1:17:04] young oh I'm
[1:17:08] 16 I was 16 now I'm
[1:17:12] 40 and brother blast says
[1:17:17] Santo what are we doing with our
[1:17:21] time time is running out
[1:17:29] well we l we we least expected our hair
[1:17:32] is falling out hair coming out our
[1:17:36] body's hurting
[1:17:39] now what are we doing with our
[1:17:43] time brother brandham
[1:17:52] says I do not believe that they are
[1:17:54] convinced that he is coming in this
[1:17:59] age I think that is why they are not
[1:18:05] worried because they are not completely
[1:18:10] convinced correct they are not
[1:18:14] convinced of why he is with
[1:18:16] them if they
[1:18:19] were they would return to his
[1:18:21] word
[1:18:28] please
[1:18:36] stand brother Bram says there another
[1:18:43] quote you cannot match the
[1:18:47] enemy
[1:18:49] I can't match myself
[1:18:57] but I remember I'm living under a
[1:19:02] promise you maybe not be able to win the
[1:19:04] devil in many
[1:19:07] battles maybe the devil's gonna beat you
[1:19:09] in many
[1:19:10] battles we see
[1:19:13] Samson Satan defeated
[1:19:18] him Satan defeated him in
[1:19:21] many
[1:19:23] that the devil defeated many of the
[1:19:24] children
[1:19:27] of but they were
[1:19:30] convinced that there was a
[1:19:33] promise now in
[1:19:34] us there is a
[1:19:36] promise that there's a
[1:19:40] resurrection although these bodies May
[1:19:43] diminish he will speak the voice and you
[1:19:47] and
