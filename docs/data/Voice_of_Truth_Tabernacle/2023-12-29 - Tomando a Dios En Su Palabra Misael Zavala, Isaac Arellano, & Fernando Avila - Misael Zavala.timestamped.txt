[31:13] Emanuel give thanks to God for the

[31:39] help and your holy
[31:43] spirit so you can help us in this
[31:46] service as much as the preachers the
[31:50] interpreters but overall the
[31:55] audience they can receive something take
[31:56] home this
[31:58] night we give you thanks for everything
[32:01] in the name of Lord Jesus Christ amen
[32:04] amen you may be
[32:10] seated we're speaking on
[32:16] Mary it started about eight days
[32:20] ago the they did a very good job in the
[32:24] play We congratulate everyone Maria
[32:30] Mary an extraordinary
[32:33] woman what can we see from
[32:37] her something that the Jews could
[32:41] not they had the scripture they had the
[32:45] Torah and they would search in the
[32:53] scriptures but the word that God blinded
[32:57] did their spiritual
[32:59] sight and they could not
[33:01] see what would happened with
[33:04] Mary even if the scriptures talked about
[33:08] her even Isaiah
[33:20] 96 prpe and it says For unto us a child
[33:23] is born and unto us a son is given and
[33:25] the government shall be upon his
[33:26] shoulders and his name shall be one
[33:28] called wonderful counselor the Mighty
[33:30] God the Everlasting father the prince of
[33:35] peace they were not waiting for God to
[33:37] come in the form of a baby
[33:39] [Music]
[33:42] why because it wasn't the first time God
[33:44] would come in
[33:45] flesh it wasn't the first time it would
[33:48] happen with
[33:50] Abraham God made a
[33:52] body and other two
[33:55] bodies for his two accp
[33:58] angels and what the Jews waited for was
[34:01] a
[34:02] man a flesh and bow and a
[34:07] leader well where they errored
[34:11] was was in Genesis 3:15 it
[34:24] says and I will put in enmity between
[34:26] between thee and the woman and between
[34:28] thy seed and her seed and it shall
[34:30] bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise
[34:31] his
[34:33] heel so what
[34:36] seed the woman does not have a
[34:39] seed the seed comes from
[34:42] man the woman is the
[34:45] camp where the Harvest is
[34:49] taken so what
[34:53] seed it was referring to the seed of the
[34:55] Lord Jesus Christ
[34:57] he was referring to
[34:59] Mary the
[35:01] woman of course he has a
[35:06] dou it's also referring to the
[35:10] church brother Bram
[35:15] says preached in 1965 the seed shall not
[35:18] be air with the
[35:25] shook
[35:36] notice it shall be light about the
[35:38] evening time the true seed come forth
[35:41] from Mary but it was not her seed it was
[35:43] a promise it was the promise of God and
[35:45] she said behold the handmade of the
[35:55] Lord
[36:03] the carriers of life was the
[36:05] woman Hagar had to receive it in a
[36:07] perverted way Sarah doubted the thing
[36:09] and brought it just through natural seed
[36:11] sexual desire but married without any
[36:13] sex at all believed the word and the
[36:14] Word was made
[36:20] flesh now it's saying that promise was
[36:22] fulfilled because she believed
[36:25] it some believing in the promises of
[36:31] God
[36:33] coming it's something to contemplate
[36:34] about
[36:36] you start meditating on the
[36:39] word start to grab onto his
[36:42] promises how many promises did you
[36:43] obtain this
[36:46] year better yet said how many did you
[36:50] obtain because if you can't believe you
[36:52] can't
[36:53] obtain it's something
[36:55] mental
[36:58] and in the end you you delusion yourself
[37:02] yourself because you don't obtain
[37:05] anything you have to exercise your
[37:08] faith Luke
[37:11] 126 it's speaks about
[37:25] Mary
[37:35] verse 26 and this and in the sixth month
[37:37] the angel Gabriel was sent by God unto a
[37:39] city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[37:41] virgin espouse to a man whose name was
[37:43] Joseph in the house of of the House of
[37:45] David and the virgin's name was Mary and
[37:47] the angel came in unto her and said Heil
[37:49] thou that art highly favored the Lord is
[37:51] with thee blessed art among thou thou
[37:54] among the
[37:55] women
[38:11] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[38:13] his saying and cast in her mind what
[38:15] manner of salute salutation this should
[38:18] be and the angel said unto her fear not
[38:20] Mary for thou Hast found favor with God
[38:22] and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy
[38:24] womb and bring forth a son and sh call
[38:26] his name
[38:42] Jesus he shall be great and shall be
[38:44] called the son of the highest and the
[38:45] Lord shall give him unto him the Throne
[38:47] of his father David he shall reign over
[38:49] the house of Jacob forever and of his
[38:52] kingdom there shall be no ends then Mary
[38:54] said unto the angel how shall this be
[38:56] seeing I know not a
[39:19] man and the angel angel answered her and
[39:22] said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come
[39:24] upon thee and the power of the highest
[39:25] shall overshadow thee therefore also the
[39:27] holy thing which shall come be born of
[39:29] thee shall be called The Son of God and
[39:31] behold thy cousin Elizabeth she hath
[39:34] also conceived in her old age and this
[39:36] is the sixth month with her who was
[39:38] called baren for with God nothing shall
[39:40] be
[39:48] impossible and Mary said behold the hand
[39:50] made of the Lord be it unto me according
[39:52] to Thy word and the angel departed from
[39:55] her
[39:57] now I want to focus on verse
[40:04] 38 brother Bram she says she was about
[40:07] 15 18 years
[40:09] old she was
[40:12] engaged she was practically
[40:19] married what surprised me is that it
[40:25] says
[40:27] she said behold the handmade of the Lord
[40:28] be unto me according to Thy
[40:31] Word how many
[40:33] youth are
[40:36] willing for the will of the Lord to be
[40:39] done in their
[40:41] lives how many have come into their
[40:45] minds to surrender their whole
[40:48] youth to the service of the
[40:53] Lord if I can be understood
[40:57] if you deliver your youth to the
[41:00] Lord the Lord will keep you
[41:03] young
[41:04] spiritually in this
[41:06] life but above
[41:09] all he will keep you young with
[41:14] eternity but if it's the thing that if
[41:16] you want
[41:18] it you have to decide by
[41:21] yourself if it be thy
[41:24] will that you believe the word of God
[41:27] it's hard for a young man
[41:31] why because they
[41:34] think that their youth is
[41:37] theirs but it's not
[41:40] yours your youth should be of the
[41:43] Lords how many youth this night are
[41:47] willing to
[41:49] say to say Lord I give up my I Surrender
[41:52] my
[41:55] youth
[42:25] Maria
[42:30] Mary's belief preached in 1960 Mary the
[42:33] Holy Ghost will come upon you and the
[42:35] almighty shall overshadow thee and that
[42:36] Holy thing that will be born will not be
[42:38] of man but he shall be called The Son of
[42:40] God she threw her little hands up and
[42:42] tears running out of those beautiful
[42:43] eyes and said behold the hand made of
[42:45] the Lord be it unto me according to Thy
[42:46] word she didn't wait until she was
[42:48] positive of this she didn't wait until
[42:49] she felt life or some kind of sensation
[42:52] to prove that she was to be a mother she
[42:54] just took the she just took his word and
[42:56] that was
[42:58] enough she surrendered her
[43:01] life she surrendered her
[43:04] future she surrendered her
[43:07] marriage but Above All She surrendered
[43:08] her heart to the
[43:13] Lord but not only was she a virgin in
[43:20] flesh brother Ben says in the spoken
[43:23] word is the original sea preach in
[43:25] 1962
[43:28] and it's something we should all do and
[43:30] we should be able to
[43:54] do now what was it the Virgin mind womb
[43:57] virgin womb for the baby results eternal
[44:00] life evea good woman as she was virgin
[44:03] as she was but first she let the doubt
[44:05] come in her in by the word a devil's lie
[44:08] what did it do brought her to contact
[44:11] into contact her wrong way what was her
[44:13] child
[44:25] death
[44:44] Mary virgin mind virgin womb when the
[44:47] devil tried to tempt her and he came and
[44:49] the angel come to her and then said
[44:50] you're going to have a baby Satan said
[44:52] now you better inquire about that the
[44:54] angel said it's an Act of God then then
[44:57] she no doubt thought of Isaiah 9:6 and
[45:00] she said behold thou handmade of the
[45:03] Lord what's the results virgin birth
[45:05] Eternal Word in her in her and she
[45:07] brought forth eternal
[45:10] life when she surrendered everything to
[45:12] the
[45:13] Lord Sheed eternal life she received
[45:17] life in order to give
[45:19] life sometimes we want to give
[45:22] life but if we haven't received life
[45:25] then what are we going to
[45:26] give can't give life if we don't have
[45:30] it every
[45:32] preacher every
[45:35] Minister prepares to receive
[45:37] life in order to project life not just
[45:41] here but anywhere he's at there was a
[45:44] man who surrendered his life surrender
[45:48] his family surrender his time he could
[45:51] have been
[45:52] rich but he was
[45:54] poor
[45:56] he surrenders
[45:58] money his name was William Mar and
[46:01] Bram we're sitting here because he gave
[46:05] it all he gave it
[46:07] all he gave his life for
[46:10] God he gave his his life for
[46:15] you a place in this
[46:18] Pew he
[46:20] had he had a wife he gave it
[46:24] all he
[46:34] fcas if filled Luke
[46:38] 14:26 and hate not his father and mother
[46:40] wife and
[46:42] children it's the same as Matthew
[46:47] 10:36 that loveth his father a mother
[46:49] more than me
[46:52] not son and daughter more than me is not
[46:54] worthy of me
[46:56] it's not that you'll despise
[46:59] them but you'll always put God
[47:02] first then your children than your
[47:08] wife you have to place God before before
[47:11] your
[47:14] work sometimes I see when the youth are
[47:17] recing and they get to
[47:20] marriage and later
[47:22] on they go they backslide
[47:27] they disappear from the place they're
[47:29] serving that's when
[47:35] they
[47:36] responsibility than those who are coming
[47:39] from behind
[47:42] them I can't read everything because of
[47:48] time preached in 62 versus
[47:52] Faith sometimes we don't
[47:54] understand
[47:56] why my father gives so much time to the
[47:58] church why my mother gives so much time
[48:00] to the
[48:03] church you should ask that to the
[48:05] children of the pastor to the wife of
[48:07] the
[48:08] pastor I believe they have that
[48:12] question why do my father have so much
[48:14] time at the
[48:17] church why does he have more time with
[48:19] the people than with
[48:21] us because he has
[48:23] conviction to serve and give life
[48:29] life one time sister beta gave a a
[48:32] letter to brother
[48:54] br
[49:05] my wife she's here somewhere she got a
[49:07] letter from a lady over there in
[49:08] Illinois the other day it just burnt
[49:10] into so of my heart this lady said
[49:13] brother sister banham said there's no
[49:15] doubt but what how many times when down
[49:18] thou when down through since you've been
[49:21] married that you have to suffer a lot

[51:00] [Applause]
[51:08] you God bless you
[51:13] Brothers I hope we all came to see
[51:19] God we didn't come to see any
[51:24] human to see God
[51:28] right follow me to Matthew 1:21
[51:35] please I'm I'm excited to share a secret
[51:38] with you
[51:42] tonight I think it's a secret for most
[51:44] of us
[51:46] amen but we'll we'll get
[51:49] there but Matthew 1:21
[51:53] reads and she shall bring bring forth a
[51:56] son and thou shalt call his name Jesus
[51:58] for he shall save his people from their
[52:08] sins now all this was done that it might
[52:11] be fulfilled which was spoken of the
[52:14] Lord by the prophet
[52:21] saying
[52:23] Behold a virt shall be with
[52:27] child and shall bring forth a
[52:30] son and they shall call his
[52:34] name Emmanuel uel which being
[52:38] interpreted
[52:40] is God With
[52:43] Us let me tell you we have Emmanuel with
[52:50] us you don't look too
[52:53] convinced Maybe by the end of my sermon
[52:56] you will
[53:01] be but to
[53:03] begin it's important this time and all
[53:07] times that we understand who God
[53:11] is in the Bible it
[53:14] says that heaven is my
[53:18] throne and Earth his foot
[53:24] stol
[53:29] uh brother uh Bernie he he tripped me on
[53:32] that one last
[53:36] time I don't know if you remember
[53:40] that but let me paint you a picture of
[53:42] what that
[53:45] means Heaven is my
[53:49] throne and Earth my foot
[53:53] stol so
[53:55] God in
[53:58] heaven resting his
[54:01] feet on
[54:07] Earth and we thought Earth was so
[54:12] great we thought this planet was
[54:17] amazing but this is only God's foot
[54:22] stool so how little do you feel
[54:29] now the Earth that we think is so
[54:34] amazing with all the oceans
[54:37] combined all the continents
[54:41] combined and God rests his
[54:46] feet on this
[54:51] planet earth has the surface
[54:54] area
[54:59] of
[55:00] 197 million square
[55:05] miles 197
[55:09] million and it's just a step
[55:14] stool it's just a
[55:20] bench and God says I'll put my feet on
[55:24] it
[55:26] I want you to understand how great God
[55:31] is the god that broke a rib off of
[55:37] Adam formed a
[55:40] woman and
[55:42] later makes himself so
[55:45] small to get inside a
[55:54] woman
[55:56] we celebrate the birth of
[55:59] Christ but not the birth of
[56:03] God God can't be
[56:06] celebrated like we celebrate the birth
[56:09] of
[56:10] Christ because he is from
[56:15] Everlasting he's to
[56:18] Everlasting he's the Ancient of
[56:22] Days let me tell you the god that you
[56:24] serve
[56:27] he's the Prince of
[56:28] Peace he's the Everlasting
[56:32] father he is without beginning or
[56:36] end our God can
[56:40] move our God has
[56:44] power he was before the first drop of
[56:53] water
[56:57] before there was
[56:58] light that's the god that you
[57:04] serve he's our way
[57:07] maker he's our Bread of Heaven he's our
[57:11] strength he's our
[57:14] breastplates our
[57:16] Shield he's our Heavenly
[57:21] Father God is God and will always be God
[57:28] I just want to talk about God
[57:31] tonight because God being so
[57:34] big made himself so
[57:38] small so even the the scripture says
[57:42] they wrapped them in swaddling
[57:50] clothes but that word swaddling
[57:53] clothes if you didn't
[57:55] no it's
[57:58] actually since he was born in a
[58:02] manger they were the
[58:05] rags that they used to clean the drip
[58:09] off the nipple of the
[58:14] cow that's how low your God
[58:19] got you can't get lower than that
[58:22] brother you can't
[58:25] the
[58:27] almighty in swaddling
[58:30] clothes God so down for
[58:35] us and he was still
[58:39] God the Lamb of God being
[58:44] born the Lamb of
[58:47] God that's why he was born in a
[58:50] manger where the animals
[58:53] are because he was the
[58:57] lamb but yeah he was God in the
[59:00] manger he's God
[59:03] everywhere he's God after church is
[59:07] over he's God before church
[59:11] begins he's God in the middle of the
[59:15] ocean he's God in the middle of the
[59:18] desert he's God in the time of
[59:23] trouble I'm talking about
[59:28] God when you
[59:32] start praising
[59:35] God you'll
[59:37] stop worrying about
[59:41] flesh
[59:43] Mary I don't see a
[59:46] belly I haven't had sex I haven't had
[59:51] sex but I'm trusting to give birth
[59:59] she was not thinking about the
[1:00:02] flesh she left rejoicing the word
[1:00:07] says because when you praise
[1:00:10] God demons
[1:00:13] tremble hell gets
[1:00:17] nervous hallelujah
[1:00:19] hallelujah curses are
[1:00:23] broken and
[1:00:25] yolks are
[1:00:30] destroyed glory to
[1:00:32] God if you're thinking about praising
[1:00:34] God
[1:00:37] anytime no for a
[1:00:39] fact whatever you're
[1:00:42] feeling whatever you got on
[1:00:45] you it's GNA fall
[1:00:48] off anytime you praise God whatever
[1:00:52] Wicked spirit
[1:00:55] needs to fall
[1:00:57] off amen whatever the devil
[1:01:01] said it won't stop
[1:01:04] you as long as you praise
[1:01:08] God that's the god that we
[1:01:11] praise the one that walks on
[1:01:15] water the one that speaks to winds and
[1:01:19] waves the one who has the last
[1:01:23] say I don't know what the devil has told
[1:01:26] you but Jesus has the last
[1:01:29] [Applause]
[1:01:31] say the one that can heal all manner of
[1:01:37] disease
[1:01:40] tonight forgive me next year or
[1:01:47] now let's start using the biggest word
[1:01:49] we
[1:01:52] know you might know a word with 25
[1:01:57] letters but the biggest
[1:01:59] word has three
[1:02:02] letters
[1:02:03] and let's all say it
[1:02:06] together
[1:02:09] God amen amen it's big on the
[1:02:14] earth it's big under the Earth and it's
[1:02:17] big over the
[1:02:19] earth that is God that's the most
[1:02:23] powerful name
[1:02:25] when all hell is breaking loose in your
[1:02:29] life the devil expects you to
[1:02:33] crumble
[1:02:35] shout
[1:02:37] shout
[1:02:40] go amen amen B you never seen me like
[1:02:46] this that's what happens when you praise
[1:02:49] God I'm
[1:02:51] guilty I haven't been praising God
[1:02:55] it's my goal from now it's my goal from
[1:02:59] now to start praising
[1:03:01] God take God at his
[1:03:05] word I need a
[1:03:15] drink nobody can stop you from having
[1:03:20] God and nobody can stop
[1:03:23] God
[1:03:24] from having
[1:03:27] you ain't that good
[1:03:30] news because if God be for
[1:03:34] us if God be for
[1:03:39] us who can be against
[1:03:43] us you need to
[1:03:46] understand the magnitude
[1:03:51] magude of what we are about
[1:03:58] about what magnitude are you
[1:04:02] about you need to understand that the
[1:04:06] magnitude of
[1:04:08] yourself to
[1:04:10] understand the magnitude of the fight
[1:04:13] you're
[1:04:15] in the fight is not
[1:04:20] thin the fight is
[1:04:23] thick
[1:04:24] right I know we all have great potential
[1:04:27] in
[1:04:30] us and that's the magnitude we
[1:04:34] have because we were
[1:04:37] built you know what you were built
[1:04:43] for if we are children of
[1:04:46] God God doesn't have
[1:04:50] chickens God doesn't have
[1:04:53] cowards
[1:04:55] glory to
[1:04:57] God understand the magnitude of
[1:05:01] yourself so you can understand the
[1:05:05] magnitude of this
[1:05:07] fight because hell hates
[1:05:12] you hell hates
[1:05:15] you because heaven loves
[1:05:20] you the devil hates
[1:05:23] you
[1:05:25] because God loves
[1:05:30] you the devil wants to intimidate
[1:05:34] you I remember a
[1:05:38] sister in the
[1:05:42] play all those voices talking to
[1:05:46] her trying to intimidate
[1:05:49] her trying to have her
[1:05:53] doubts the devil C comes and wants to
[1:05:56] trouble

[1:13:00] well we're here
[1:13:02] now of God we are
[1:13:05] here we've had battles and
[1:13:08] struggles the enemy cannot withstand
[1:13:11] us God on our
[1:13:15] side Luke chap
[1:13:17] 1 28 to
[1:13:22] 31
[1:13:35] Angel went to her and said greetings you
[1:13:37] who are highly favored the Lord is with
[1:13:48] you Mar he was greatly troubled at his
[1:13:51] words and wondered what kind of greeting
[1:13:52] this might
[1:13:59] be but the angel said to her do not be
[1:14:02] afraid Mary you have found favor with
[1:14:10] God will conceive and give birth to a
[1:14:12] son and you are to call him
[1:14:15] Jesus you may be seated
[1:14:22] Brothers uh
[1:14:25] brandham he narrates in one of his
[1:14:29] [Music]
[1:14:31] messages the message we've been reading
[1:14:33] Mary's
[1:14:35] belief of the Jewish
[1:14:37] Traditions their
[1:14:43] Customs said one day prior to the angel
[1:14:46] visiting
[1:14:47] [Music]
[1:14:49] Mary that one day before that she was
[1:14:51] leaving the synagogue Joseph and Mary
[1:14:56] were and in the afternoon it was a
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:01] custom they sat and and spoke about the
[1:15:05] word of the message that they had heard
[1:15:08] that
[1:15:11] morning they said they were hungry more
[1:15:13] for the word of
[1:15:14] God that's what brother
[1:15:17] [Music]
[1:15:18] says and they began to seek more
[1:15:22] scriptures
[1:15:23] and then they went to the scripture of
[1:15:25] Isaiah 96 and it says like
[1:15:28] this unto us a child is
[1:15:30] bornto us the son is
[1:15:34] given and the government shall be upon
[1:15:36] his
[1:15:37] shoulders and his name Shall be Called
[1:15:40] wonderful counselor Mighty God the
[1:15:43] Everlasting father the prince of
[1:15:47] peace and Mary began to ask
[1:15:51] Joseph what is this scripture referring
[1:15:53] to
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:56] and Mary says that
[1:15:58] brother brother Bram that Mary said per
[1:16:01] I don't
[1:16:02] know but I believe he's speaking about
[1:16:04] the messiah's
[1:16:08] coming he said that Mary stayed with
[1:16:10] that
[1:16:11] scripture in her mind and meditate on it
[1:16:14] throughout the
[1:16:15] day it says in the evening that she
[1:16:17] could not sleep he
[1:16:19] said she could woke up the next day late
[1:16:23] because she was unable to
[1:16:27] sleep it was the custom of the Jewish
[1:16:32] people the day for her to go to the
[1:16:35] well so that she could
[1:16:38] wash he said that Mary continued
[1:16:41] meditating with that
[1:16:46] scripture felt something strange around
[1:16:49] her and that's when the angel appeared
[1:16:52] before her
[1:16:55] we just read what he said
[1:16:57] amen I like what brother Bram
[1:17:02] says because of the thought that Mary
[1:17:04] had on her
[1:17:06] mind she had that scripture and was
[1:17:09] meditating on it
[1:17:11] in that is why the
[1:17:14] angel before
[1:17:17] her he said Mary was meditating on the
[1:17:20] word of God her mind was on the
[1:17:25] mind was on the word of
[1:17:27] God when your mind is on
[1:17:30] God your mind is on the word of God
[1:17:34] brother Ram
[1:17:35] says that the course of your life
[1:17:40] changes it changes your
[1:17:42] [Music]
[1:17:43] atmosphere and you create a beautiful
[1:17:48] atmosphere and he also narrates the
[1:17:50] story of
[1:17:52] cleopas
[1:17:54] when he was going to his friend with his
[1:17:55] friend to
[1:17:57] EMAs the Bible says that they were sad
[1:18:00] and and
[1:18:01] buring of the crucifixion of
[1:18:06] Jesus says that
[1:18:08] they they had Jesus on their
[1:18:12] mind that is why Jesus to
[1:18:16] them the Bible says that Jesus himself
[1:18:18] Drew
[1:18:20] n because they had Jesus Christ on their
[1:18:22] mind
[1:18:23] because they were in the
[1:18:27] word brother says that's one of the
[1:18:31] reasons that the angel appeared to
[1:18:36] Mary ask you where is your mind to this
[1:18:40] evening you know why God doesn't come
[1:18:42] down many
[1:18:44] times where are our
[1:18:48] thoughts in that same message Mary's
[1:18:51] belief is like
[1:18:56] this oh if we didn't have so many other
[1:18:59] things on our
[1:19:01] minds know sometimes we come to
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:06] church meditating that tomorrow I have
[1:19:09] to do this the next day I have to do
[1:19:13] this when we come to
[1:19:18] church we're to put aside every thought
[1:19:21] and the thing of the world
[1:19:24] enter into fellow and
[1:19:28] worship
[1:19:30] meding in our
[1:19:32] hearts and giving songs and prais to him
[1:19:35] meditating on the goodness of
[1:19:38] him what he means to
[1:19:43] us worshiping in the
[1:19:46] spirit spiritual
[1:19:49] songs Melodies in our hearts the Bible
[1:19:54] says if anyone is
[1:19:56] Afflicted sing
[1:19:58] praise be
[1:20:00] happy
[1:20:02] meditation always
[1:20:04] waiting for
[1:20:07] God to appear to
[1:20:09] you we get to
[1:20:12] church with worries that aren't even
[1:20:15] worth
[1:20:16] it what are you thinking

[1:20:21] thoughts what am I going to eat after
[1:20:24] service what am I going to do
[1:20:26] tomorrow what am I who am I going toang
[1:20:29] out me to the fellowship
[1:20:32] tomorrow let go of all
[1:20:34] those and allow God to come on the
[1:20:38] scene if our
[1:20:42] thoughts are in the right
[1:20:44] place I have the
[1:20:46] certainty that God can come down on the
[1:20:49] seene that the Holy Ghost can move
[1:20:53] Maria
[1:20:56] Mary she had she was in the right
[1:21:00] thought then the angel
[1:21:03] said do not be afraid
[1:21:06] Mary you have found favor with
[1:21:09] God you will conceive and give
[1:21:12] birth to a
[1:21:17] son you are to call him
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:21] Jesus
[1:21:23] when the angel said that unto
[1:21:26] Mary Bible says that
[1:21:29] Mary she she took hold of the word of
[1:21:32] the
[1:21:36] Angel brother Ram
[1:21:38] says we take God at his
[1:21:42] word our life changes its course amen
[1:21:51] amen but I need the word of God this
[1:21:54] [Music]
[1:21:55] even but says we need more
[1:21:59] Mar take God at his
[1:22:02] word receive his word and
[1:22:06] rejoice based herself
[1:22:10] on she didn't wait for the baby to kick
[1:22:12] in her
[1:22:15] womb she did not had of
[1:22:18] evidence but even then she
[1:22:20] still she took the angel
[1:22:24] which was the word of God
[1:22:27] Mary the Bible
[1:22:30] says she ran Elizabeth toward
[1:22:35] elizabar the the the wife of Zachariah
[1:22:39] Elizabeth Elizabeth was um was
[1:22:44] pregnant
[1:22:46] John the Bible says that she was six
[1:22:48] months
[1:22:51] pregnant but that there was no
[1:22:54] movement brother tells
[1:22:57] us that that baby was
[1:23:00] dead there was no life in that child
[1:23:03] there was no life in
[1:23:05] John but when Mary came from that place
[1:23:09] where to give her the good news of her
[1:23:13] pregnancy
[1:23:16] says the first time the name of
[1:23:21] Jesus
[1:23:23] was pronounced by human
[1:23:24] lips it brought life to a dead
[1:23:28] baby in the womb of his
[1:23:31] mother the baby inside of
[1:23:34] Elizabeth
[1:23:36] leap she was filled with the Holy
[1:23:39] Ghost what could happen this
[1:23:42] evening we invoke the name of
[1:23:46] Jesus and be filled with the Holy
[1:23:50] Spirit she believed
[1:23:55] with simply the word of the
[1:23:57] Angel his word is more than
[1:24:00] enough the word of God was more than
[1:24:04] enough it was more than enough for
[1:24:07] Mary what about you
[1:24:10] Brothers what about you
[1:24:15] sister is the word not
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:21] enough
[1:24:22] God gave us his
[1:24:25] word but he also sent his
[1:24:30] son and his name Shall be Called
[1:24:33] wonderful counselor the Mighty God
[1:24:38] Everlasting
[1:24:39] father the Prince of
[1:24:42] Peace I ask why did God send his
[1:24:47] son what did he see in
[1:24:51] US
[1:24:53] and I began to
[1:25:01] meditate the Bible says in John 3:16 why
[1:25:04] sent son so that we would be saved but
[1:25:06] it also says
[1:25:09] that so that he could dwell in
[1:25:12] us I have to know
[1:25:14] you he was made
[1:25:20] flesh experiment and go through what we
[1:25:23] go he was made
[1:25:27] human said he was as one of
[1:25:30] us he ate like
[1:25:32] us he dressed like
[1:25:35] us walked like
[1:25:37] us like
[1:25:39] us what does all that
[1:25:42] mean that the Lord Jesus
[1:25:45] Christ he went through Temptations
[1:25:49] afflictions pain sadness
[1:26:03] how God knows
[1:26:07] us what we go through what we're going
[1:26:10] through but remember brother R also
[1:26:14] says that God is a
[1:26:18] gentleman if you open the doors of your
[1:26:20] heart to God he will come
[1:26:24] in but if you don't want him to come
[1:26:27] in he won't come
[1:26:29] in because he's a gentleman amen if you
[1:26:33] would please stand the musicians can't
[1:26:35] come
[1:26:39] forward we don't want to have a
[1:26:42] relationship an intimate relationship
[1:26:44] with
[1:26:46] him we don't want him to enter into our
[1:26:50] hearts we just let him come
[1:26:53] into and we tell him you stop right
[1:26:56] there don't enter any longer don't seek
[1:27:00] anymore God knows when you're
[1:27:03] sad he knows when you're
[1:27:06] Afflicted he
[1:27:07] understands he sent his
[1:27:15] son I I remember one of the my most
[1:27:18] favorite preachings of from the
[1:27:21] pastor we live in a
[1:27:24] world where if something
[1:27:28] breaks we just go and replace
[1:27:32] it God he said God's not like
[1:27:35] that sometimes we are
[1:27:37] broken we're
[1:27:40] broken but God restores us he uses us
[1:27:44] again he picks us
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:47] up because God is
[1:27:50] righteous because we are his children
[1:27:53] children because we have for
[1:27:56] [Music]
[1:27:58] him perhaps this evening we're broken
[1:28:02] and that's
[1:28:05] fine perhaps we're in
[1:28:07] pain that's
[1:28:10] okay maybe we have many
[1:28:13] problems maybe our
[1:28:17] family maybe our marriage isn't right
[1:28:20] and that's
[1:28:21] okay
[1:28:23] [Music]
[1:28:28] but I believe God gave us the
[1:28:30] necessary enough to
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:35] fight us enough to fight with what
[1:28:37] we your family's
[1:28:40] broken don't let it stay in
[1:28:43] that if you're sad don't stay in that
[1:28:47] stat don't stay

[1:49:25] we put as a Church
[1:49:29] petition God opened up the doors for our
[1:49:34] church we did the fast this
[1:49:37] year we said we're gonna
[1:49:39] ask open up the doors for our
[1:49:44] church part of our
[1:49:46] prayer and God answered
[1:49:49] us kind of God that we
[1:49:51] [Applause]
[1:49:56] serve
[1:50:00] it's I believe it's important to
[1:50:02] remember what we've asked of God asked
[1:50:04] God for and that's why it's it's good to
[1:50:06] write it
[1:50:08] down for you to later come back and
[1:50:11] remember has been faithful to his
[1:50:18] word sometimes it's EAS for us to forget
[1:50:22] it to forget that God has answered many
[1:50:25] petitions for
[1:50:27] us so if you write that personal letter
[1:50:30] put your name on
[1:50:32] it we're GNA bring it here
[1:50:35] forward and re uh put it in believing
[1:50:38] amen
[1:50:40] amen and then beginning of the
[1:50:45] year we're gonna start the
[1:50:49] fast
[1:50:51] and we're going to encourage everyone to
[1:50:52] do the
[1:50:54] fast we understand that maybe not
[1:50:56] everyone's going to do
[1:50:58] it we encourage everyone to try and do
[1:51:02] it it's not in vain as we just
[1:51:05] say God answers our
[1:51:11] prayers and we're going to do it a
[1:51:13] little bit
[1:51:15] different where we're going to focus on
[1:51:18] prayer
[1:51:23] and we're gonna put three different
[1:51:27] times in
[1:51:32] the in the
[1:51:35] afternoon for everyone's praying at the
[1:51:37] same time all that
[1:51:40] can we're going to be praying those 21
[1:51:43] days at least three times a
[1:51:48] day and on Wednesdays that we're here
[1:51:53] uh we're going to dedicate them to
[1:51:58] prayer we're gonna accustom ourselves to
[1:52:03] praying because sometimes we're too
[1:52:07] fety brother says
[1:52:11] that sing a lot and preach a
[1:52:14] lot or too
[1:52:16] much we can't pray enough or too much
[1:52:22] so we're going to do things a little bit
[1:52:25] differently week of
[1:52:27] January the first seven
[1:52:29] [Music]
[1:52:32] days we want for us to focus on
[1:52:36] ourselves first week just pray for
[1:52:39] examine
[1:52:41] yourself the second week we want to pray
[1:52:43] for someone
[1:52:44] else perhaps that second
[1:52:48] week we'll see the petitions of everyone
[1:52:52] else and the third week we want to pray
[1:52:54] for our
[1:52:56] church what God has placed in our
[1:52:59] hearts is to focus on
[1:53:05] prayer this upcoming
[1:53:07] year battles are going to get even more
[1:53:11] difficult we have to counteract the
[1:53:14] enemy attack the enemy and and take god
[1:53:18] seriously so then prepare to pray some
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:22] more some of you pray prepare to pray
[1:53:25] even more a lot more than what you're
[1:53:28] praying
[1:53:32] now think that sometimes we come to
[1:53:34] church and we don't even pray
[1:53:36] right that's why we come and don't
[1:53:38] receive anything
[1:53:40] am so if you can then buy yourself a
[1:53:44] notebook so that when we come to
[1:53:46] pray you can write down what God has
[1:53:48] told
[1:53:54] because prayer is a two-way
[1:53:58] street other words you speak to God and
[1:54:00] God speaks to
[1:54:06] you and you can write down what God
[1:54:08] tells
[1:54:10] you God to help us
[1:54:14] brothers so we're going to be doing the
[1:54:18] fast we're going to be taking communion
[1:54:21] and
[1:54:24] doing God might direct us to do
[1:54:28] something prepared for
[1:54:32] anything but we just want to dedicate
[1:54:34] ourselves more to
[1:54:37] God and to give him the first the first
[1:54:43] fruit because the first fruits of
[1:54:45] everything he gives us we ought to give
[1:54:46] back to
[1:54:48] him
[1:54:51] he deserves the tithing of our
[1:54:56] year it's not an entire tithing because
[1:54:59] it
[1:55:01] days at the very least let give him
[1:55:03] three weeks
