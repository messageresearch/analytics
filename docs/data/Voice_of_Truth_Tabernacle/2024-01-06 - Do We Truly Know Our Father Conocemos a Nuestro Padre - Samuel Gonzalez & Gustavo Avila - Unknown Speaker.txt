amen God bless you brothers and sisters reach all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ man I'm happy to see each and every one of you tonight it's truly a blessing to be here tonight Brothers I believe it's a blessing for each and every one of us you know because many don't get the opportunity to be here you see in the time that we're living now Brothers there's a lot of people out there filled with corruption and darkness you know but thank God that we are in his house tonight giving him all the praise all the honor and glory amen there's a reason to be happy tonight brother because we serve a god who's not dead He's Alive and he's alive in each and every one of us amen amen I want to give thanks to to God first you know for I for basically allowing me to be here you know there's so many things to be thankful for brothers I give thanks to God for giving me breath for the fact that I'm still alive today there's a there's so many reasons to be thankful brothers and I just give thanks to God because of that I want to give thanks to my pastor as well for giving me the trust to be here man as as you're standing may you please open your Bibles to John chapter 1 verse 10 to 14 when you have me please say amen and it says like this he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world World knew him not he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory and the glory as of the glory Glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth amen may we bow our heads Brothers dear Lord gracious Heavenly Father we give you thanks Lord for giving us another day of life thank you Lord for allowing us to be here tonight Lord there's no place where I would rather be Lord than to be here Lord Lord I ask you in this night Lord may you was my lips Lord Lord may it be you talking tonight Lord May the focus not be on me tonight Lord may it be on Only You Lord Lord may you help me tonight may you help my brother Gustavo as well Lord and Lord may may this message Lord be a help for one person I ask all this in Jesus name amen amen you may take your seats Brothers tonight I along with my brother Gustavo we want to focus on the story of Jesus's childhood and for a title we have put it as do we truly know our father you know if you could let that sink in Brothers if you could meditate on this question do we truly know our father you know cuz many people could say they know our father but at the same time they don't want to serve him you see looking into the Bible the Bible doesn't mention a lot about Jesus's childhood see very little is told about Jesus's childhood you see between Jesus's birth and the beginning of his ministry not much not much is mentioned but when you read the Bible the few the few references that we can get brother of Jesus's childhood is in the Book of Luke you know but what we must understand Brothers is that the childhood of Jesus wasn't anything out of this world it wasn't anything out of the ordinary you see Jesus experienced a natural growing process similar to any other growing boy you see but what stood out of Jesus what stood out of young Jesus Christ you see was the wisdom in which he had at such a young age in which God gave him you see Luke 2 verse 40 says and the child grew and waxed strong in spirits filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon Him Jesus at such a young age was strong in strong in spirit and was filled with wisdom brothers and in one occasion we can see this in Luke 2: 41 and and In this passage we can see that Jesus and his family they traveled to Jerusalem for a festival in which it was called the Passover and the Passover it was a Jewish holiday in which Israel celebrated as a remembrance of deliverance from slavery in Egypt verse 41 says now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast so seeing here Brothers we see that Mary Joseph and young Jesus celebrated the Passover which lasted seven days and it says in verse 43 and when they had fulfilled the days and as they returned and the the child jesus carried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of it so after the seven seven days of the Passover War over on the eighth day they set out to leave back to Nazareth but we see that eventually that Mary and Joseph find out that Jesus was not with them you see we see that Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem while his family had already begun the trip back to Nazareth you see verse 44 says but they supposing him to have been in the company went a Day's Journey and they sought him among their King Kings folk and acquaintance verse 45 and when they found him not they turned back again to Jerusalem you know the city of Jerusalem brother you see was one of the biggest cities in all of Israel at that time it was one of the biggest cities in Israel I could already imagine and how Joseph felt filled with anguish fear knowing that their son was out there and you see verse 46 says and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions you see so Mary and Joseph after three days Brothers you see they find little Jesus in the temple in which the doctors and the teachers of the law would impart their teachings to others and here it occurs that little Jesus a boy of 12 years old is in this Temple you see and the Bible says that he was talking to the doctors of the law you see Brothers I want you to focus here tonight you see Jesus was a child he was a little child and these doctors and these teachers you see they were specialists in writing they were theolog you see they were people who spent their entire lives you know studying the law and studying the scriptures you see but the Bible says that these doctors these teachers were so surprised they were so amazed with the wisdom that our Lord Jesus Christ had you see not only that brother you see but the scripture also says that when Mary and Joseph found him in the temple you see they were surprised they were amazed you see with the understandings that he had just imagine of a boy of 12 years old surrounded by these doctors you see verse 48 says and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thou thus dealt with us Behold thy father and I have S these s Sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wish ye not that I must be about my father's business you see Brothers they were so amazed and surprised because first of all Brothers you see Jesus had no indication of being lost you see he looked calm when when Mary Found Jesus in the temple I believe that he didn't look lost little Jesus he knew where he was he knew where he was you see he knew his purpose of why he was in that Temple you see it was no coincidence it was no coincidence at all that little Jesus was in that Temple you see he knew what his purpose was and what his mission was and that was to know his father's business father's but the problem with Mary and Joseph is that they couldn't understand they couldn't understand why Jesus was in the temple in the first place they told Jesus Son why have you done this to us we were so worried for you but young Jesus knew he knew his task he knew his priority he knew his purpose and why he needed to be in that Temple you see I believe Jesus said where else would I be than in my father's house where else would I be in my father's business see Jesus knew who his father was maybe Mary thought that that Joseph was the father you see but that was his Earthly father Jesus knew who his true father was and if I could ask you all a question tonight do we truly know our father do we truly know our father you see we come to church Wednesday Friday Sunday three a week brother we come to church but sometimes although we come to church we don't know what we're doing here know we're here we don't know what what's the reason that we're in church we don't you see we just come to church because at this point Brothers it is a r R for us to go Wednesday has come let's go to church Friday has come let's go to church Sunday has come let's go to church see but we're living it like a routine you see we are living in a Time youth we are living in a time we need Jesus every day not just Wednesday not just Friday not just Sunday we need him every day we need him every we need more of God just three with just three days we're not going to have enough we need more of his how many believe that tonight we need more of Jesus you see Brothers we need him every moment and for the Youth you know for the Youth for the Youth it's very hard living in this age you know it's it's hard for the Youth to live in this generation no we're surrounded by Darkness we're surrounded by corruption we're surrounded by social media we surrounded by lust we're we're surrounded by hatred by violence and all of these things and we come to church influenced by these things you see our minds are too occupied with the things of this world to the point where Jesus can't dwell in us there's nothing but darkness in US know that there is darkness in me you see because if I could be honest brother I sin every day I do what I I do things I'm not supposed to do I sin today we need more of Jesus you see Brothers brother Bram says that we got to shake ourselves you got to shake ourselves and we have to realize that we are men and women of God we are the creation of God this world isn't our home this world will never be our home you know the problem with the youth sometimes we try to find excitement in the wrong things no we try to find excitement outside of church Brothers you could talk to me about sports talk about me real quick you could talk to me about football excited right away I'll get excited right away oh you want you want to ask me a question about sports I'm gonna be like Siri I'mma ask the question right away and the answer you see Brothers we get excited over wrong things we we a church let's be sincere tonight youth Brothers of the brothers we know we get excited when that sister one more time we know we get excited when that sister comes up to us and starts speaking to us right we get excited don't we we get excited when she approach es us we get so excited when she talks to us along with the sisters maybe you get excited when the brother comes up to you you see and we get so excited to the point where we forget about everything else and our main focus is just that brother is just that sister and our main focus is just that where's the excitement of Jesus where's the excitement of coming to his house see where's that excitement that the youth had that one service when everyone was in the altar ho Spirit was moving everyone was jumping where is that excitement you see there service is what we're like that you see but the following service more stiff more stiff than a statue brother where's that excitement for Jesus we should be excited to come to the father this world has nothing for us this world has nothing for us at all the devil is going to try to make you think that you have a purpose out there your identity is out there that your identity is in drugs just have just have fun out there see but there's something in here there's something in here that you will never find out there you see out there it it might feel good out there it might look good but what's in here what's in here what's in here is real what's here is real here is what our soul needs see our flesh Longs for the things of this world you see youth we get excited we get excited when we think about we get excited when we think about that feeling of when we're going to meet that special person one day always dream of getting married that's that's that's how the youth think sometimes I know that but what about Jesus where's that excitement for Jesus you should be excited to come to church every day you should be excited to come to church every day oh but Brothers there's always excuses to why we can't be excited for church you see some of us could say some of us makes excuses to why we distant ourselves from God you know sometimes we say oh the reason the reason I'm not that that close to God is because I'm going through things right now you know I'm dealing with I'm I'm stressed out I'm dealing with a lot of things Jesus went through went through what you guys went through Jesus went through that through that stress Jesus went through that pain Jesus went through everything but sometimes we can't come to church expecting because we are so closed up are so closed up God can't D us you see Brothers we don't deserve to be here we don't deserve to be here at if there's one person who doesn't deserve to be here me I don't deserve to be here you see but it's by his grace and mercy that we here youth I don't think you know I don't think you know how blessed you are I I don't think you know how privileged you are to be here tonight you see we could be out there Brothers of Christ we could be out there high on drugs right now we could be out there begging for money in the streets sisters you could be out there prostituting yourself to the world but thank God that you're here tonight you see it's no coincidence that we are here oh Brothers I know it's hard for us to live in this age and youth we're going to go through pain we going to go through [Applause] trials go through stress and and we maybe we might think that no one might will never understand us Jesus understands us Jesus understands us clearly see CU Jesus he could have came down so that he could be served you see but he came down he came down as flesh he came down as a human to be like the likeness of man you see to be to serve others you see Brothers sometimes we try to serve our serving God we are in where are we tonight Brothers we are in the father's house we are in this we are in the father's house and God wants to give us an opportunity this isn't like any other night Brothers you see tonight is an opportunity for you to have a reconcil with god let's not take this night for granted brothers because we don't know if tomorrow we might die tonight we have the chance just open yourselves up to God and he do the rest God bless you [Applause] you give another clap offering to our [Applause] Lord if you came expecting me to excite you you you're mistaken I believe that in these days we should be sensitive to the holy spirit for this fast the promises we made on this altar a new year a new beginning but as our brother Samuel said sometimes we're so cold like a statue the Revival is not in a group it's individual the word is spoken and now God has to do his job I'm just an echo and the pastor is an echo every minister is an echo we don't bring anything new we bring nothing that will give you Goosebumps if you came expecting something new brother and sister you'll leave appointed I come to bring a word with my brother Samuel that's the same yesterday today and forever can someone tell me the title of this night do we really know our father do you want to know him do you truly desire to know him are you here tonight or are you just focusing on want on my jackets we're GNA find out after tonight what truly you're focused on focusing on a man or you're focusing on your heavenly father let us go to Revelations 3:1 17 apyp uh I'm not mad I'm just focused if I can say Revelations 3 chapter verse 17 because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and I have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked may God add blessing to his word we've come to the center of it all everything before that we've preached was just a shadow and everything after this point it back to the center who is Jesus Christ aren't you happy that we're talking about him now every person before him and after is him aren't you happy that all your life is surrounded of him because he wants you to know of him be so part of him that no one can see a line of separation between but he but the question is do you care do you care enough for the things of your father to matter to you we're talking about Jesus everything he did I believe was with purpose everything had a reason and just thinking on that a little bit the question to me came why do you say Amen why do you raise your hands why do you do what you do on a daily basis there has to be a a reason for it and many times I notice in the services of Youth I I I put myself amongst you many times I hear more amens from the adults than from the youth itself reason being that I I believe is when you say Amen brother brandham says it means so be it right all right it means that in other words you had either read it heard it or know it for you to say that amen cuz you're agreeing with that but many of us don't even know half the stuff they say up here especially youth for many years I would just say Amen because the neighbor said it I raised my hand because I saw the other brother do it I was doing things for no reason but it matter to Jesus Christ to know what he know yes we know he was the word he was the fullness of the word brother Bram says he's also was certain was limited to a certain point he says verely verily I verely verely the son cannot do what the father doesn't show him amen right amen so he was limited I'm trying to bring this in an angle for the Youth okay we're talking about Jesus now the center of it all and you're gonna tell me brother Gustavo that's Jesus okay and did he not send his Spirit The Same Spirit that was in Jesus is in us as well he pour out his spirit in the church so what's your excuse what my excuse not carry out the same acts look for the same things that Jesus Christ did at the same a at the age of 12 let that sink in for a little bit like my brother Sammy said age 12 I'm 25 and I'm barely understanding half of it and I'm barely caring about it what about you what about you do you care enough to know why you say amen for do you care enough to know what pleases your father what upsets him do you care enough to question yourself every single moment of your life to make sure that you're lining up with the word making sure that you're doing what pleases your father do I care enough be the question again we should be very sensitive to the Holy Spirit right these prayers that we're doing I thank God for this because it made me makes me really think about what I'm doing day to day care what my God is doing for me right now is he alive if so where in my life ask questions cuz many times we're just okay with being normal not knowing being natural but God wants us to be Supernatural us to know about him but we truly have to seek of it brother Brown says Jesus Christ is the perfect example amen age 12 he could have been partnering going on he could have been part of the party part of the celebration like our brother Samuel said he knew his purpose he said brother I don't know my purp I'm gonna make it very simple if one of your purposes to serve God then you're doing what's right that's one of your purposes serving God making sure that you're doing everything in your life everything in your power to make your father happy that's one one of our purposes in this life to serve our God let those know that don't know of him what he can do for them you are a living testimony believe that you are a living testimony I'm a simple person God is very simple don't over complicate it he's very simple Brothers I'm getting ahead of myself I had a lot of may it be God helping us tonight giving you exactly what you need do you truly know your father brother Bram says in the message the hand of the Lord come upon Him wow time really goes by he talks about right here about Elijah he couldn't see something till he got in the spirit of it I wonder how many are in the spirit tonight in in us right now more I I'm praying that God can dwell in us right now he says Elijah couldn't see something till he got in the spirit of it he says amen amen it means so be it you have to get into the spirit of it before you can see it now brother BR gives the example I'm going to jump a little bit he says how he says that he talks about how people when they go to [Music] dances you know they they have to get into the spirits they go to a football game basketball game whatever they have to get into the spirit we also need to get into that spirit amen but we have to want to care for it because there's so many voices brothers and sisters that just clog up our mind before coming here I don't know what you were doing but truly if it wasn't focusing on God you're not going to truly be able to focus on him entirely whether it be social media YouTube YouTube again I know I'm human I'm I'm youth as well I truly want to know my father I don't want this fast to be in vain I want it to be with a purpose I want to be better than what one than what I once was I'm sorry if I'm stuttering a lot I'm not a a fancy preacher if you can say I'm not I'm not going to tell you words that you want to hear I'm just going to Simply tell you what God gave me and I pray it be a blessing unto you that's my true desire tonight God help each and every one of know him more tonight more than we've ever known him before he says brother Bram says it says that's the reason you come around to the oldfashioned meetings where they got good salvation he got through hollering amen and praising the Lord you say a bunch of Fanatics you're just not in the spirit see if this is the holy spirit then that other must be the Unholy spirit this makes you do holy things that makes you do Unholy things I want to do holy things I don't know about you but I want that Holy Spirit to dwell in me more than ever tonight say after my father's business is my business I'm going to put myself in as an example my father owns a business and I am a son now if I go to the barber shop and I don't know what to do what to ask for how things wrong how do I expect to know what benefits I have what certain respect I should obtain Jesus Christ himself at a young age 12 years old in the temple three days and we can barely be sitting down for 25 minutes and you want something Supernatural to happen right now you want something amazing to happen right now it's all in you brothers and sisters I can simply present the word of God and then it's you and God between there well you but I do believe there's someone that truly cares I'm not here to discourage you I want to wake you up a little bit New Year service is over you know the the Revival stayed behind there we need a daily Revival we have in our fire every single day and how can we do that caring about what our father wants in business of our father being in his word praying truly praying I'm going give you an example real quick about that brother brand talks about it in the message hear his voice I know I'm closing up right now but it says right here hear his voice he says he says L 35 but there's so many voices today that takes the voice of the Lord away from us and then he says there there's the voice of pleasure so many people are listening to that where they can go and have a good time and many of them are professing to be Christians some kind of rock and roll coming up they just can't listen to what God they say well I'm a Christian I read a verse in the Bible today yeah Jesus wept that that's it go ahead but then to really go down and pray they got too many other things to do there so many voices in the world so many things to attract our attention God I don't know about you brothers and sisters but I've also been a victim of that but I'm tired I'm tired of being the victim I'm tired of playing the victim poor me me oh my poor situation oh my family is fighting I don't have the father I I wish I had I don't have the mother I wish I had oh I don't have the church I wish I had I don't have the friends I wish I had and you tell me what was what was was Samuel's excuse what was David's excuse what was Jesus's excuse at such a young age Desiring to hear the voice of God in their day desing to do what pleased their father at such a young age to search the scriptures know why you say Amen why you believe in what you believe in and not just believe what someone else tells you it says it Jesus asked and and made questions he wanted to make sure make sure of what he knew you all know this book right why we believe in on Propet I I remember back when they used to have only books and and and the ministers had to search truly search for it and then go to the Bible and here we have a blessing our beloved Pastor made it very easy for us every scripture to prove to us and yeah we don't need we don't we just simply maybe a have it in our desk in on a desk maybe in in in our drawer in the back of our drawer not really caring not not caring we but I pray and I'm trying to put a little bit of reality in you this message stops when we stop this word stops when we stop we have to we have to make sure know what we believe I have to make sure know what I believe our pastor one day is going to fade away all these ministers are going to fade away and the next generation is up do you care enough to know what makes your father happy do you know what this message brought for us it's a restoration message message show us that Jesus Christ is in our day I have to make sure it's I care about it truly more than an emotion this is real as real as you want it to be please stand Jesus Christ is the perfect example and that spirit that was in him was put it into his church I'm not telling you anything new I'm just simply a reminder of what's been told to us time and time again but it's up to us as individuals not as a group but as an individual to really know where we're standing in today you can hear about God on social media you can hear about God about from someone else but how much of that is true it could be distorted my question is to you do you know the end time signs do you know what time you're living in are you aware of where you're at right now or are you just simply taking what I'm saying what your pastor says or what any other minister says you take it in your mind and once you step out those doors you don't do nothing with it you just let it blow out you don't make sure you don't go home and make sure that that's thus sayith the Lord you don't go home and make sure that that's in the Bible do you care enough why do you take notes in in in church if you just simply leave them in your Journal you don't care enough to go home truly and making sure to yourself This is th say the Lord we have to make sure church youth we have to make I'm in this with you but I want to make sure I know where I'm standing I know who my father is I want to make him as real in my life than ever let this year not be another year of just a bunch of emotions let it be a reality to you gracious heavenly father I'm [Music] sorry I'm not I'm no one to scold I'm no one to correct when reading your word Lord you were cutting me as well you were checking me as well and I asked you what do your people need I'm a I'm useless I'm truly useless without your Holy Spirit what I know is not mine my life is not mine my home is not mine everything's yours your Prophet said what are you struggling for to live what are you living for to die I want to die to myself father die to my emotions they're they're steering me wrong let me hold on to your word vindicate your word to each and every one of my brothers and sisters we need you more real than ever before God cuz time's coming close but time is coming close where time shall be no more

was a religious feast you put it that way there was a Revival there they were all happy and over here was Jesus interested in the word I believe after there is a feast we'll truly know if it was of God what we felt it will put an interest in us for the word of God it won't just leave us there at the feast jumping and the shou and the emotions it gives us a desire and an interest know of the word of God to know more of our father and if we don't have that desire it should be a sign for us it should be a sign for you Lord if I don't have that hunger is wrong with me help me because it doesn't just have to do with emotions and the feasts it's about knowing him I've having a closer relationship to him what would you have me do Lord how tremendous right amen amen God bless our brothers for the word of God we rejoiced with the word of God we have a few announcements for all those who will be deliver to in the multi-purpose room that's where we greet each other I called it the multi-purpose room but I want to change the name I want to baptize it with another name it will be the the common room it'll be the common room so in the common room put theal there and you may do so please those of you that picked up the order for the help of the church amen um also I want to announce that we're going to start two new groups we're going to start two new groups one will be a safety group and brother Felix will be helping us with that and the other group and I will call it the the group The Connection [Music] group it'll be especially for the newer people but to see who has someone has a questions or needs so for new people they would have get information from the church do follow-ups after they visit us people that are interested in that s Tina will be helping us with that after the service if you're interested let us know get with sister Tina or with me we'll be uh talking about a few things we want to do the vision is to interested in the new people and get their information do follow-ups after the service after the [Music] week to make sure connect with them with the church connect them with the groups of the church connect them with the right information connect them with someone that can help them so that is a part of it part is if someone hasn't been come to church also get with them see if they're needing something or if they're sick do a followup connected with what is happening in the church that is the purpose and the Miss of that group we need people that that have that desire that that that burden for Souls something someone that has a burden for that speak with new people to do followups to give them information Etc so give with sister Tina if you're interested and helping we're start with doing the check we have all the information we're start with that security safy brother pH procedures if there's a fire there's someone that that there could be a danger to the church things like that for safety we need to get out of this place something happening we need to prepare for those things because you never know will be helping us with that also this Sunday this will be our second week of prayer and we want to bring letters if you want someone else to pray for you petition on your heart we could swap petitions somebody can pray for you and you can pray for them so you could have a petition the other person will read it sister and the brothers with the brothers don't put anything private in but that you would have someone to help you pray for that and the following week we pray for those things I found out about some things these days that I put the focus on the prayer I realize that that we don't like it we take it lightly I found out that there are people that that they don't care well Lord um it's a little bit sad it doesn't matter to us very much because if we need something more of it's more of a prayer and I find it that we pray very little and I find that we don't know how to pray the them was on how to pray going try to share that with you for those that haven't exercised in that area they don't like it you don't like it is because you don't know how to pray when you know how to pray you enjoy it it's a communion with your father you like to have communion with your father then what are we doing here amen Brothers what what is this about if I don't have I don't like to have communion with him amen amen Brothers well I hope that we take it more serious I understand there's Fellowship sometimes do it prior or after Daniel didn't just fast but he prayed that's when God answer fting spirits that don't come with don't leave with just a they leave with fting and prayer so both things are needed we I think God that we're finding out about these things it's better to know it's better to know something right to see if if we are if we're not if we're doing it right or not we should be so happy just as happy to know if we're doing it right or and or know if we're doing it wrong if we're doing it wrong then we have the opportunity to make it right assume or presume that we truly don't know about and if we're not doing it right I want to know I'm not doing it right yes or yes Brothers well very well this this Sunday you can bring your letter and we're gonna continue praying this Wednesday we're gonna continue praying those 30 minutes went by so quick that
