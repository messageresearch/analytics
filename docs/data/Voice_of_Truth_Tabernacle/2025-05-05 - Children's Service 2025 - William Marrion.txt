When I was young around 11, I saw my first miracle. And I didn't think I would probably survive it at first. [Music] At first I thought just like starting to die, feeling [Music] pain. I never felt that pain as a kid, ever. But that pain was really painful for me. And when my mom noticed, we had to go straight to the hospital. At the time, I didn't know what was going on. Uh then I found out I had the appendix, but they had to do the surgery the next day. So I had to have appendix for two whole days. And that was not supposed to be very common. And during after the operation, I still didn't feel real good. The fever was gone, but like I didn't want to eat. I didn't want to walk. I I had to get an IV. It was pain to be in there. I wanted to be free outside, hang out with my family. But then my pastor came for a visit, Pastor Mel, and he prayed for me. He said, "Oh Lord, please guide the nurse's hands to to help dear Adonai." [Music] Right after he left, he also said that all the other sisters and brothers was praying for me and I felt loved at that time. And at the end of 2 weeks, around 2 weeks, uh I was free. And then ever since I felt like that was my first miracle I ever [Applause] saw. Amen. Beautiful testimony for my brother Adam and I. God bless him. Amen. We have a little commercial for you guys.

[Music] One day when I was at school, I was eating and then something happened and that I was that it hurted when I was eating my throat. It was like it was burning like there was fire. And then I I went to the nurse's office. They told me they told me that my tonsils were inflated because since my tonsils are really big, sometimes there's no space for my tonsils that when I eat it hurts a lot even when I drink. So even if I eat solids or like love food, it would really hurt. And so then they told my mom and she went to pick me up. And since she is a nurse, see, she went and told me to open my mouth. She told me that my tonsils were inflated. And so then that night we went to the hospital, the emergency room. I was scared and I didn't really like the feeling, but I knew I had to go in the hospital room even though I was scared. And then when we got in the room, um the doctors came. They told me that my that they were going to do a test on me to see if I ate anything bad or if I was allergic. They never told me why my tonsils were inflated, but they did told me that my throat was inflicted. And then that day I had to stay at the hospital for about two or 3 days. My dad came and he told me everything was going to be okay and that I was going to be all right. And that really touched me because I didn't really want to be there. And then that day when I got home, I went with my dad and I told him, I really appreciated what he told me cuz that really touched me. When he told me I was going to be okay, I knew God was right next to me, that he was always with me for the past three days, that he will always be with me even though when I'm on the ground trying to get back up on my feet. That I will always get up and God will always help me to get back up. Amen. What testimonies from our young children. Amen. Amen. If our song leaders could come up again and we're going to continue our service. You guys may stand with us. Our God. Our God is It's on. It's on. God is a wonderful I was wondering if you guys could help us sing [Music] [Music] Victory. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Happiness. Happiness. Happiness today is mine. [Music] is and joy is mine. When joy is mine, joy is my [Applause] [Music] sight. It is the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is mine. The Holy Ghost is my my behind. Is mine. Oh, victory is mine. Oh, victory is mine. Oh, victory today is mine. my mind when I told Satan to get me behind. Victory today is mine. When happiness is mine, when happiness is mine, happiness today is mine. my mind. And I told Satan to give me cuz happiness today is [Music] mine. I think this is ours. So great to hear be here, right? So, can we please turn our scriptures to 1 Corinthians 1:27? It's I'm happy to be with all of you today. So, once you have your scriptures, can you say amen? Okay. But God chose the foolish things of this world that he may might put shame to them that are wise. And God choose the weak things of this world that he might put the shame to the things that are strong. Let's pray. Dear Lord, heavenly father, this service is not only for the children but for everyone. May the children and the people receive something today, Lord. May it take them home, Lord. May they take you home. We ask this in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. So today we're going to be talking about the ordinary people. Oh, and also you can sit down. So we're going to be talking about the ordinary Everybody's ordinary here, right? No more clothes, no more face. Well, don't let Let the children answer. Let the children answer. You know the Bible, right? Raise your hand if you know the Bible. Raise your hand if you know ordinary people in the Bible who did great miracles. Tell me what are some of the miracles in the Bible that they did. Come on. That Jesus walks on water. Great. Anyone else? Nathan the sick. Uh Samantha or Joy. Yes. Isabella. And he resurrected. Yes. So, we're going to be telling the story to the children of what Joyce, Sister Joyce said, when Jesus feeds over 5,000 people. Through who? How did it start? through an ordinary little boy with a lunch. That's all he fed 5,000 with a lunch. So first Jesus was just teaching everybody you know and they c and more and more people came because his words were full of truth and love and soon everybody was getting pretty hungry you know like as flesh everybody gets hungry. So then there was so the disciples said to the people or to Jesus, let's just send them out because they're getting pretty hungry. But there's nowhere else to go. So but Jesus had a different plan cuz because we all because we have to go against the ordinary. So there was a little boy with two loaves of bread and a five fish. He asked the boy to give it to him and and he obviously gave him because it because there's something about Jesus, huh? So Jesus broke the first before breaking the bread. Of course, you have to pray, huh? Like don't forget to pray. Hey, don't forget to pray. Can I every little kid, can you put your hands together as if Jesus were praying? And then he broke the bread and fish and he told the disciples to passing them out. He put a little piece of bread and put them into a basket, told them to spread it out. But for some reason, it never stopped coming out. It fed every single person through what? A boy and an ordinary lunch. And that's all. Look, Jesus didn't use gold treasures for miracles. Amazing as that. He just used us. one of our kind, small, weak. He used him to make miracles. He could use one of us to make miracles. But the first thing is just like in the story, we have to give him the bread. Give him the bread. There was nothing magic about the bread. It was about giving it to him that made the miracle. That could be that could be like giving your heart to God or worshiping him just like brother Joshua Abraham and Nathan playing the piano for God doing a special. So miracles still happen today. even through simple ordinary things like us through a smile through taking care of someone sick. It's God through us. It's not him doing the works, but it's him through us. He uses the weak, the normal people. the the ones who sin. He picks them up and says, "I'm going to use you. I'm going to use each and every one of you. He doesn't need the great people. He doesn't need kings. He picks the weak up, makes it better. He uses them as a small cup. They found it on They find it on a floor. It's all dirty. He washes it and make something great out of it. He can do what? He could do the powerful through each and every one of you. Yes, sir. Just offer yourself. Give him the bread. Give him the fish. And it will be a great blessing to everybody. You can take your kindness, your faith, your small acts of love. and he multiplies them. He takes it to every people in the whole world. He doesn't use the great, he uses a small. Even if it's just microscopic, there's a multitude that he can make from that. So don't be afraid to give your food. Okay? Even though it's tasty, but don't be afraid to give what you think is special. I mean, in reality, it is special, but if you give it to God, he'll make it giant. If brother uh the next preacher can come up. God is still in business of making miracles today through the small. Amen. Amen. God bless you. How many are happy to be here tonight or this afternoon? I know some of us are tired. I know I'm tired, but I'm happy to be here. I'm excited. Are you guys excited? Kids, are you guys excited? I'd like to read a quick scripture here in Jeremiah 15. You don't have to turn to. I'll just read it real quick. Before I formed thee, in the belly, I knew thee. And before thou camest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations. Yes, sir. The theme for this afternoon is living, walking miracles. How many here are living walking miracles? I know I am. I know God for ordained something for me. I'm not sure what it is yet, but I'mma find out because he's done miracles in my life. I'm a living, walking miracle here where I stand. How many of you know the story of Moses? Do you guys know what the story of Moses? What happened when he was three months old? He was put in a basket and in the river. Correct. Yep. And Pharaoh's daughter found him. So Pharaoh wanted to kill all the little kids or the little men in the time of Moses when he was born. And he wanted to kill everyone or every little boy because he knew of a prophecy that God would bring a deliverer for his people. But Moses's mother and his father, his parents, they saw something in Moses and they said, "We have the faith that if we put him in the Nile River, we know our God will save him." How many you guys know what was in that Nile River? Crocodiles. So, can you guys imagine being placed in a river as a child? You can't do anything. You're just there in a little cradle being flown down the river while there's a ton of crocodiles trying to eat you. And not only dying to eat you, but they're eating the other children as well. And to be able to know that Moses was saved and he br was brought to the palace of daughters of Pharaoh's daughter. What do you guys What do you guys How would you guys feel if you knew your parents did that to you? Scared, afraid, confused, sad. I believe Moses, this is what the feelings Moses had when he knew what had happened to him after they found him. But Moses always knew where he came from. He never forgot. He always knew the miracle God did for him, what God did for him in order for him to become the person he needed to be. And Moses was saved as a child. And that miracle, God for ordained that to happen for Moses. Now, why why would he do that? Why would God do that? To save him? Anyone else? to be with him. God fore orained that miracle for Moses in order for Moses to be saved in order for Moses to deliver his people. See, that miracle wasn't just for him. It was for the entire people of Israel. It was for the entire people so they can be delivered from Egypt. And this afternoon, we're all living walking walking miracles here. How many of you have been healed or delivered? What did God do for you guys? He healed you. What else? He helped you with a math test. Oh, be baptized. I'm sorry. Yes. These are all things God for ordains for us. things that God allows to happen in order for us to do his will and in order for him to place us in a position where we can help others. We're all living walking miracles one way or another. I'll tell you a small testim about me. When I was in my mother's womb before I was even born, my mom was being shot at from an opposing an opposing gang. Before the womb, God had four ordained that I would not die that day. When I was just a toddler, God saved me from falling off a three-story building. When I was just a toddler, God saved me from drowning in a bucket. When I was defend defenseless, I knew I didn't know any better. God has saved me countless times throughout my life. And even as a small child, he for ordained those things to happen in order for me to be here. He forained me to be here in the United States. Come here as a child for a reason. God has a reason for you in order. He allows things to happen to you for a certain reason, for a purpose. Now God has already done his part. He's already done the miracles. He's already done things in your life. Now, it's up to you guys to find out why he did that, to find out that purpose, to find find that calling that you guys have. You know, God gave me a gift. And that gift is not just for me. It's it's for my people. It's for God's people. You know, many times we want our gift for ourselves. We want to be seen. But it's not like that. Moses had to learn that. He had to go to the the desert 40 years to learn that he had to surrender himself to God and do it God's way, not his own way. And if we can just realize that we are all living walking miracles, pre-ordained to be living walking miracles. then that will give us that thirst that we need in order to find that calling that God has given us. I'm to believe that I already see something in the kids that I don't see many times in the youth. Sometimes I see the kids worshiping harder than the youth or worshiping harder than their parents. I see that genuine faith in the kids that allows them to have that relationship with God. I see that in the kids. And I'm not trying to bash the youth or the parents, but I see something special in you kids. There's something in you guys. You guys are the next generation up. You guys were pre-ordained for this time. You guys were pre-ordained to be great. You know, sometimes you're going to fall. Moses fell. Moses had mistakes, but that never stopped him from serving God. That never stopped him from trying to get near to God and trying to do his will. I see something special in you guys. And always remember, I am a living, walking miracle for a reason. God did it by grace. I am here by grace. And it's up to me to find out why he did that. God bless you. Living walking miracles. Who here is a living walking miracle? I don't see many living walking miracles here. Who here is a living walking miracle? You sound You guys sound a little bit too quiet. Who here is a living walking miracle? Yes, we're all living walking miracles. youth kids, you guys are all living, walking miracles. Did you know that you're the reason or you're the proof that miracles exist? That's right. Think about that for a second, kids. You're the reason that miracles exist. Without you, there'd be no miracles. Right? Without any of us, there would be no miracles at all. Now, let me tell you something that you might not know, but when you're born, you know, there's a slight probability, right? There's a slight probability that you might not make it. So, that tells me something. That tells me that if you're here right now, that alone is a miracle. Are you guys Are you guys listening? Okay. The the fact that you're here right now proves to me that you're a miracle. And I'm It's a statistic. I'm going to tell you right now. Look, it says globally approximately 2.3 million children die in the first 28 days. So who here is a living walking miracle? Who here is a living walking miracle? You know, Albert Einstein, who knows Albert Einstein? Well, maybe we didn't meet him face to face, but you know, we know who Albert Einstein is, right? He was a smart person. Albert Einstein once said, he said this, there are only two ways to live your life. He says, one is as though nothing is a miracle. And the other is as is as though everything is a miracle. as if though my brother is a miracle, my sister is a miracle, my pastor is a miracle, my church is a miracle. How many can say amen to that? There's one scripture in Job 58. It says, and this is uh one of Job's friends that was telling Job this. And as we know the story of Job, Job got sick, right? He was sick. One thing that God did not allow Satan to do was to what? Touch his soul. But he can do everything he wanted to with his body. Right? So here is Job going through the hardest moment of his life. The hardest moment of his life. Okay? And it says right here, it says, "If I were you," now this is one of Job's friend going to telling Job, he says, "If I were you, I would go to God and present my case to him." And it says, "He does great things too marvelous to understand. He performs countless miracles." All right, I'm going to ask you once again, who here is living? Who here walks? Who here is a miracle? You know, sometimes sometimes we wait for miracles. Sometimes we're expecting for something great or big to happen. Sometimes we're in expectation for God to do something. But like our brother Alden said, he uses people like you, like Eli. He uses people like Samantha, like all of you here to prove that you are miracles, to prove that we're all miracles. If I could get the musicians to come forward, I don't have much time left, but I want to There's many miracles that Jesus performed. a lot of miracles and our kids just explained to us some of the miracles. But one miracle that really captures my eye a little bit is when Jesus was able to walk on water because not many people walked on water, right? Not many people were able to walk on water. And that alone is a miracle. It's a miracle. And so here is Jesus, right? Jesus is shows up to the disciples, right? And he tells the disciples, well, the disciples see him and they're afraid first of all, right? They're afraid of Jesus. They're they're not afraid of Jesus, but they didn't know who he was. They thought he was a ghost. Are you guys listening? They thought he was a ghost. They thought Jesus was a ghost. But then Jesus comes and he shows himself. He shows himself in the water. He performs a miracle in front of them. Shows it to them. But you know what? You know what Jesus also told his disciples? He says, "The same thing that I've done, you shall also do. The same thing that I did, you shall also do." So Jesus is telling you tonight, the same miracles that I did, you can also do. How many believe that? How many believe that? So we can't be waiting for miracles, brothers and sisters. We can't be waiting for miracles because your whole life is a miracle. Your whole life is a miracle. [Music] Maybe I'm just too excited right now. I can't I don't even know how to express myself. But can you look at your neighbor and tell him and tell them I I am a living and walking miracle. But say it like you believe it. I am a living and walking miracle. Can you please stand up with me this this afternoon? Stand up with me. We're going to praise the Lord. God is telling each and everyone, God is telling the kids right now, you are a miracle. You are a miracle. You are a miracle. All of you guys are a miracle. Yes. Me too. Yes, I am a miracle. Yes. And God loves all of us. So why don't we just worship him for a little bit and then just open to him and say, "God, here I am. Use me. I am your miracle. [Music] [Music] We're all miracles." Amen.
