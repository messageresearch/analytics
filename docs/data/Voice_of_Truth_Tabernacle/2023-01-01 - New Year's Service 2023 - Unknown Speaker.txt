with vows we'll meet it with pledges we'll meet it with good intention saying we'll try to turn a new page that's all good I appreciate that is it'll never be Eternal until God first when you meet God

foreign foreign thank you foreign [Music] our feet for God's holiness says when you're a Son of God your disposition your attitude your attitude changes two three minutes over here be different for this year this year difference God's spirit is here amen hungry Lord Jesus Christ in its place I am here your story holds the time God bless you Brothers [Applause] all honor and Glory is [Music] of all things Second Kings two nine says like this we were talking about Elijah when they had passed Elijah said to Elijah ask what you want me to do for you ask yourself these questions today you can be delivered foreign in their souls and I get there clean what a shame God didn't promise US an easy gospel this gospel is not easy this is [Music] you decide Brothers now the word difficult is they require that requires intelligence sorry skills or effort now what does effort means attitude of the person who makes an effort now it tells you here that you have to ever yourself they think Grace or salvation is free now there was Elisha your Lord shall be taken away where are you standing he kept his eyes on him not murdering if he passed by through someone maybe someone tonight wanted to discourage you brother Elijah it doesn't matter what you've gone through amen it does not matter reporter it doesn't matter what you've done report that it doesn't matter I don't think there's someone worse here than an apostle Paul [Music] videos he didn't pay attention to that tonight don't pay attention to where you hear you're gonna find things that don't please don't lose your sight let us not lose focus discouragement will come to our lives had discouragements in his life Jesus Christ discouragement in his life there's great men in the Bible that wanted to run away is this to whom shall we go the song says to whom shall we go to whom shall I go where are we going when we're going to depart from this earth oh Brothers I have a theophany waiting for me oh Brothers you have to be sure God bless you [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] who was plowing with 12 yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and Elijah passed by him and cast his mental upon him and he left the auction and ran after Elijah and said let me I pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then I will follow thee and then he said unto him go back again for what have I done to thee Anton says and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instrument of the ox sin and gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went after Elijah administered unto him is you may be seated you know uh one of the things that I learned from the scripture is that you know when Elijah found Elijah Elias so when Elijah found Elijah he found in plowing he didn't find them just doing nothing he saw something special you know and I think that you know this year has showed me that you know the god that God's willing to help you know those that are willing to put in the word willing to put in the time you know I like I like uh you know this Elisha was a committed man he was committed he was completely committed to the Lord I wasn't just telling everybody but he went and he burned everything [Music] at least foreign foreign that that is actually the biggest difference that's right it will determine everything listen to this he says so that little piece of scripture just a teeny little one inch square on just a piece of paper yet if the right attitude is taken to the Scripture it would change the Eternal destination of this world it is you see it's the right attitude any promise of God whether you fail or you have success how are you looking into this year what are you gonna do what will you do get out there because we could try all we wanted but that's not gonna help you see when the brothers my brothers he used to talk to us because they used to talk to us when he wasn't so blessed you see the only difference is not necessarily maybe no neces but I believe that sometimes a Brother's blessed and the other one's not yeah the only difference is because one was willing to put in the world that was the only difference he was willing to work it was willing to have the right attitude that's the difference foreign [Applause] this man was willing to wear it not part-time not uh Tiempo he was all in at least he was committed to God he might have gotten tired but he had burned everything he had he burned everything because he had a college he was gonna follow God no matter what it took no matter who he had to leave yes he was committed to God there's a lot of times when we feel like we can't continue yes but you gotta be strong I learned one thing this year foreign [Music] it comes vienne it comes from the tents from the from from something tender viennes something soft I'll go tierno that's right that's what I believe because though you know the only reason that I wake up about it a lot of times forum there's a soft side I believe that that's that's what the Lord showed us when he left his throne and that was his pride yesterday your brothers that's what I learned this year God bless you [Applause] Hallelujah venices here too has God helped someone here in this year Hallelujah the Bible says that the enemies shall come like a river we've seen that tonight Jesus and lifted up his eyes to Heaven say father the hour is to you who come with the decision now oh yes let me tell you tonight is a night of decisions tonight choose who you Shall Serve thank God in his word the word has been preached Los Angeles the signs have been done the holy spirit is here the time the hour has come foreign what about you is now Brothers you have to make a decision Whom Shall We Serve continue saying the time the hour has come signs to follow the Believers I'm gonna repeat it again has to be is foreign [Applause] continue saying great signs and wonders shall come to pass the time has come all the time has come circumcised the church hours someone else's head no no no no no no here you won't happen the time has come is the end times the Holy Ghost repeating the hell of the prophets we'll prepare fruto the first fruits oh we're the same as before always the hour has come [Music] for the church arise listen so Rises From the Ashes and yes this New Year we will go into um how will you face it Let's Be The Name Of The Lord is there will be a prize that is washing the blood of that lamb yes God is among his children repeat with me it's time to show [Applause] [Applause] God bless you brother turn [Applause] can you play something soft uh you know I'm not programmed to speak but um or while I was back there it was um to remind me everything happening tonight and you know the title of this God put this in the heart of Brother John uh he thought he brought that thought and we felt it was God and as I was back there brother John was giving me his whole preaching his entire preaching he was giving it to me simply sharing it and while I was back there told me say what he was sharing with you because we were sharing between the both of them well the majority that I'm gonna say is teaching and I believe that Elisha received mental the mantle uh residuals he didn't receive it just because he saw it at the end he received it because he went through all that process [Music] he began and gilgal primero first in gilgal Eagle is Brother John was telling significant means to go red circles means uh go in circles and many times we stay there going in circles but he didn't stop there every one of the places he wins you know we went to Israel and every place they were horrible places all those places are in the desert it was a hard package it was the entire process was that he never stayed foreign palm trees because that's where they vacation foreign don't stop there no security don't stop there [Music] many of us are relaxed [Music] he went to cross the Jordan and brother John put it this way Jordan means to send and this is before Elijah ascended he had to descend es and before we can receive something else from God we have to descend you have to be humble Jesus Christ if the grain of corn does not fall on on the ground and die it remains alone please don't come to the altar we'll be doing a prayer line foreign foreign if the crane of wheat does not fall on the ground and die it remains alone in other words it stays the same time I don't want to be the same next year [Music] I don't want to end this year and continue the same next year the same yo quiero I want that fruit so bear fruit s Jesus Christ said if the grain of wheat does not fall on the ground you die remains alone but if it dies it brings forth much fruits I'm not sure what you've been saying but there's a way to walk there's something else to do is more to sacrifice for God I don't think uh not anything it was a coincidence for Brother John has sure he's preaching with me I don't think it's coincidence [Music] [Music] where have you stayed stuck any of us are still in Jericho relaxing we don't want to go to Jordan [Music] we have to go through the difficult process the year is beginning now how will you receive him will you stay where you are oh well you ask something else from God will you give another step forward don't stay where you are espiritus in your life [Music] and help us pray brethren also come [Music] foreign how do you want to receive this give another step of Faith give a step of faith give one more step s go forward [Music] I'm Gonna Keep advancing the year's beginning [Music] the spirit of God is here all you have to do is open your heart all you have to do is say Lord I'm the worst of the worst I haven't done what I should be doing but I don't want to stay here okay I don't wanna stay here in my situation [Music] [Music] give him this moment to him foreign [Music] [Music] oh my God [Music] foreign [Music] I heard this yesterday sometimes the most
