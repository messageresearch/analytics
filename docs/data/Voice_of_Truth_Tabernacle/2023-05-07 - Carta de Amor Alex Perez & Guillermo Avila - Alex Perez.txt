yes this morning foreign of his church the Del Tiempo Del fin the Seal of the end time when it starts sit up enlo absolutely will be absolutely a total secret according to the Bible it's a secret yes we're good right I'm not here this morning it's a secret mysterious this time contra contrary always against the truth of the revelation of this mystery is this mystery excited Church but the bride is standing on it in other words this Revelation Above This mystery brand name is telling us about the mystery of the bride and begins to tell us yes and develops a lot of things now so we can understand this is foreign and so Eve came out figure he realized it was not a help for him already God complete without his help is correct is that correct brethren IA now this help is inside of him but had not been manifested right Amen brother okay sigamos let's continue the mystery of God revealed okay he continues saying what was God's purpose now God had a purpose has always had a purpose hi I'm reading um 88 paragraph 88. then if through this life of this son La sangri his cross the blood that he might reconcile to himself a body is which is Eve okay let's see if we can understand what we're reading
