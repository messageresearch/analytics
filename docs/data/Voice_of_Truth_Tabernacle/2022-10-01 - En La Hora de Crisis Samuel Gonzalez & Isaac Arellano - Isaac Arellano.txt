Colo foreign he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over foreign verse two and they came to pass after three days that the officers went through the house Los officiales amen let us pray Brothers we give you thanks Lord we don't we can't give you enough things for how much you've done for us Lord we are blessed to have you as our Lord Jesus Christ Lord we are so blessed because we have a God who is eternal thank you Lord gracias I ask you Lord tonight may you set me aside along with my brother Isaac foreign you know before I explain what I just read right now in Joshua chapter 3 verse 1 and 2. I want to go back in the a little in the story of Joshua and do a quick summary so that we may be able to understand what I want to speak about it you know the new throughout the Journey of Joshua and the children God is with them you know I remember when my brothers were preaching a few weeks ago and how she put her faith and confidence and here we could see the story advancing yeah the Israel is at the Jordan River after 40 Years of wandering in the wilderness you know and I will if we could please read verse one and two again of Joshua chapter 3 and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from shatim and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and launched there before they passed over they're finally where God wanted them 40 years ago you see but they didn't cross Widow right away you see let's remember that we are talking about millions of people that were waiting at the edge of the river it was in a group of ten it wasn't a group of families it was millions of people maybe more than two million dollars who were waiting at the edge of the river and maybe it was easy for the two spies in which Joshua sent before these people now it is difficult for the the millions of people so here they are waiting for three days you know I believe that many things happen during those three days and now I believe a lot of things were going on in the minds of the Israelites let's remember that God has let's remember that God had promised them the promised land you see it but for now God had them there waiting for three days foreign and brings them and puts them to the edge of the river you see I believe that he brought them to the edge and he made them wait so that they could meditate that it is not easy without him you see we have to understand they're all these people have accumulated a lot of things during the past 40 years they're looking at what God has promised you see but there is an obstacle you see now God gives us a promise but at the same time he puts a response puts uh impossibility in it so that we could realize that it is only God that could fulfill that promise you let's not forget Who We Are what we have what we have in this in Christ you see what God has given us what God has given each and every one of them it's no coincidence everything that he has given us it is by his grace you see God promised us that he was gonna be by our side you see she shows us things and he show he put situations in her life so that we may remember that that it is because he permitted it you see he does all these things so that he could give us what he has promised us you see God does all these things certain situations that it is impossible without him nasty but also so he could test our face you see God will always put situations in her life you see so our faith can grow but what does God really want from us see if God wants our confidence in him that can grow you see here's the problem you see many of the times we have confidence in ourselves instead of the Lord and that's the problem you see we have too much confidence in ourselves that we don't need Jesus Anymore you see look what happened to Moses when Moses wanted to take for the when Moses wanted for the first time to take the people of Israel out of Egypt Moses had too much Moses had too much confidence in himself to take the people out of Egypt foreign ERS for 40 years to take all that confidence she has you see and when Moses lost all that confidence then God knew that he could use him you see we are instruments of the Lord and God wants to use us you see many of the times that's the issue you see God wants to develop our faith and now we're confident you see I believe that us has a gift maybe you might not be able to realize foreign you see Joshua chapter 3 verse 3 to 5. and they commanded the people saying when ye see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priest the Levites then ye shall removed from your place and go after it yet there shall be a bit there shall be a space between you and it's about 2 000 cubits by measure ye may know that ye may know the way by which he must go for ye have not passed this way yet for okay okay and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourself for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders here in verse you know the Bible mentions the Ark of the Covenant and you know what was the ark of the covenant you know I believe that the ark represented the presence of God with the children of Israel you see God commanded Moses so answering the Tabernacle there was different sections if only you would enter the holy place but beyond the holy place was the holiest of holy I'm and that was the Ark of the Covenant you see this is what brother Branham says and a guide preached in 1962 what was the orc the word don't travel your domination denominational Roots stay right behind the roots still right behind the word because you haven't passed this way before brother if there ever was a time that the Christian Church ought to examine itself it is right now well right now we're the we're in this great meeting the confederation of churches when all these denominations are confederated together to form the image of the Beast just exactly what the Bible says and you know what we said this morning in the messages everything right at the door and people still following after creating you better stay behind the word foreign [Music] [Music] you see this is the importance of the Ark of the Covenant you see the ark was the presence of God with the people of Israel But Not only was it the presence of God and I like this you see because we could see that God gives a plan to Joshua dios a plan you see God is with us so the same way he was with Joshua and the Israelites you see and if God is with us we can stand against us you see Brothers God wants to put us in situations where it looks difficult and sometimes we don't even know why you see God only wants to do that so that we may learn depend on him because it is only him you see Brothers there's gonna be times where we're gonna be at that Jordan that spiritual Jordan is we're gonna feel like there is no way out maybe that Jordan in your life can be depression anxiety hate audio addiction addiction you see but God provided something God provided something that was the art yes in our time that is the word you see we have the words but not only do we have the words we have the message to see everything that we need is in the words you see but the problem is we have we don't have we have the audacity to not even grab our Bibles we listen to a message for at least five minutes oh brothers or confidence you see Brothers why do we limit Our God you see we have to stop thinking that we can do everything [Music] see our God doesn't have limits he's the same yesterday today and forever please stand with him this is what brother Brandon says the same preaching a guide we're told again that when Israel was following their God and they came right down to Jordan send us right down to the Red Sea must be in the very line of duty they were stopped and the god LED them down there to show his glory and when all hopes was gone then God looked down through that Pillar of Fire And even the old Dead Sea inclusion and she rolled back and there was a path made for Israel to walk over to the promised land holy Lord you're still the same God these people maybe are Christians maybe they're right in the path of Duty but they've been brought into this corner place where sickness has cornered them look down through the blood of Jesus will get scared he'll move back and your children shall pass over to the promise of good health granted father I send it from my body to theirs in the name of Jesus Christ see Brothers there's no reason for us to put our confidence in ourselves you see when we have limits that's where God doesn't you see Brothers when we put our confidence in the Lord nothing can stop us you see that the God knows our potential you know who else those are potentials the devil knows our potential and when we take a hold take a hold of the words to possess the gates of the enemy let us learn to put our confidence in the Lord and lean on him in the good times are in the bad times God bless you brother it is um I admire my brother Samuel Mi hermano Samuel and he inspires me at a young age what God does through him he's Peter uh This Moment reminds me of when we were in Mexico in Mexico we also preached together and you know maybe my brother Samuel needs more um Improvement just like we all need Improvement right but my brother Enoch sitting back there God bless him after the service we had in Mexico in Mexico he shakes my hands and I thought he was gonna say something good right but he tells me he tells me you're a rookie but not a wannabe amen we might need improvements but we know God is working in us we don't want any wannabes in here we don't want one foot in and one foot out we want both feet amen and it's a it's good to be here in this night before you is and before I read the scripture I kind of want us to get everything into sequence and don't worry I'm a teacher that Obama preach a little also God helping uh so uh after the Red Sea Del Mar Rojo now they're at the Jordan River I don't know if you remember the preachings my brother Titus preached uh last year on the series of Joshua this is the Red Sea was a natural baptism of the water it is if you remember there was um excitement by um uh I forgot her name that began to play the tambourine the medium [Applause] and then after that was there so they encamped at gilgal it was on the outside of Jericho he he got this and that's that's what's going on between Joshua chapter 3 to chapter 10. but before Joshua 10 Joshua makes an alliance with the gibbian nights yes they deceived Joshua they use in a summary what was going on Joshua was conquering these cities and this man put old garments on yes and they went to Joshua and said we're from fare but they were actually their neighbors and they were scared that Joshua would overtake them so they prefer to make an alliance and here's where I begin the reading of the word in Joshua 10 verse and it says now it came to the past when Don is a king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken I and had utterly destroyed it as he had done to Jericho and her King so he had done to I and her king and the inhabitants of gibeon made peace with Israel and were among them is that they feared greatly because gabion was a great City and as one of the royal cities and because it was higher than I and all the men thereof were Mighty uh fuertes and to save time brother and I'm going to skip to verse 12. and it's and uh this night our title is the hour of Crisis and what my focus will be is two things in this night uh the first one will be Joshua's error is Josue and how God can take a mistake and turn it into a victory it says in uh verse 12 verse and I'll be speaking when Joshua stops the sun then speak Joshua to the Lord in the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the side of Israel Sons stand out still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of agilon is amen amen one of the most outstanding verses in the Bible I believe is that you can find that a human being stop the sun you know the creation beside Adam um beside Adam obey Joshua too over this and you can't we can't explain it it's a paradox and Paradox is also a miracle just like everyone sitting here it's a miracle now everything that was going on in Joshua's life was preparing him for that historical the Bible mentions everywhere if my name was in the Bible it would mention all my mistakes foreign you know someone that sins makes mistakes and that's me Brothers now brother Branham says that the Bible is a book about God not about men because God exposes the mistakes of men so that we can see how great the power of God is he speaks about the mistakes and failures of Joshua and we should be thankful in this night that we can identify identification with this great men doesn't matter what they did they were still God's chosen you know in chapter nine we see where Josh [Music] after taking these cities you know like I said they deceived Joshua to make an alliance you know and when a man fails the people begin to speak has anyone made a mistake and there's rumors about you now we can identify the same Joshua went through he made an alliance he wasn't supposed to is he didn't search for God's um advice here I'm not sure if I'll keep following him no I saw this at church I'm not sure if God is with them you know we begin to the devil begins to work in us you know and I'm not sure if this is God's chosen people now but God chooses human beings God has never chosen Angels or any other thing it's always been man leading man amen and we don't want to get controversial but God chooses amen amen oh my God I'm reaching about now you know and Joshua's mistake was making an alliance with gabians that's what the war about that's what the war was about when the Sun starts Joshua is about to have War persuade over an alliance and I know I'm repeating a lot because many times we're making alliances with the wrong people with the wrong things we're starting friendships when there should be friendships we should be standing with each other and it's good to have friends out there no maybe you're fishing from for Souls you know but we should begin here with the ones God has given us amen amen you know it matters who you're friends with it's important it matters who you're associated with it with you who you have an alliance with and you have to make a decision to ask for advice when you're gonna join someone or something or I'll go because there's battles that will be yours because they're the other person's battles that you're associated with because you know many times we join the wrong thing correct we hang out with the wrong person and we're fighting battles and trials that we shouldn't be fighting Joshua didn't need to fight this battles but he didn't look for advice he got himself in there you know we're fighting these things because we weren't careful when we decided to choose who to identify with identification you know for the Youth I know we go to school and we see nice things and we want to identify with them the world is also here um they went against scorpion foreign foreign foreign if anyone did something bad to me oh I'll go meso I'll go Malo if anyone spoke against me here blowing Contra de me Joshua Josue was still standing next to gibbian no matter how much they deceived him no matter how much they lied to him there's consequences to our mistakes but God sees beyond that you know and if God sees beyond that we should see Beyonce we should still stand with each other we need to see it how the word says it's a spiritual fight spiritual and uh right now the the Holy Ghost is uh moving in here and uh brother Titus said on Sunday that is the people that are in the sewers are the people that come and think I have to give you any pizza about other people here that are not where they should be okay and that was me brother yes and I thought I was right I was in the sewers we shouldn't come to church and criticize because they're not where they're supposed to be no it's their process you know uh I was I wanted to be strict one time and my pastor corrected me he told me be strict with yourself sir you know what gibians you're a deceiver you're a liar mentiroso you struggle in your own way but if the enemy comes against you count on me how many can say that how many can tell their neighbors right now count on Mego you know this was Joshua's third pole you know he fought in Jericho he fought and this was the third battle and he was about to go to Wars with five Kings ought to be a Gibby inside you know he didn't have to fight but he was faithful to his word no he was a man of his word [Music] [Applause] that the sun is still still in our time God is still giving us time to forgive that last person to forgive ourselves to fix the mistake you know God redeemed the time for Joshua that he lost how many can say tonight Lord I messed up made mistakes I need time to fix my life I need time Chase these armies down and obtain my victory Victoria and in this night we need time and God is giving us mercy and Grace so do what we were sent to do but uh you may stand I'll be closing now if God hasn't come yet if God hasn't come yet it's because he's giving us time we're in the evening times It's Not Dark Yet because God is waiting for us to fulfill the job God let the whole world knows that day that the sun Stood Still yes it didn't matter how many mistakes Joshua had no important it didn't matter all the bad things he had done but in public that he supported God was saying I'm still on his side and Heaven supports him you can stop the sun tonight the son of righteousness you can stop the son of righteousness he says stop the Sun brother Branham says in the master stand still um Jesus still said bring him here oh brother she's sister still and they brought the beggar to him his face stopped the Son of God and brought him to a standpoint to a still stop uh I say tonight I don't care who you are I mean or what your name is how poor you are how far gone you are Faith tonight will bring God to a standstill to your humble Christ your faith in this night so foreign [Music] foreign that was a little talk he wanted with him he said thy faith has safety and in if I can leave you with this Carlos thy faith has safety doesn't say how much space just says faith and our Prophet is to only believe well you gotta get inspired like Joshua the thing against that is just like sister had he writes it was in the line of duty to ask for the Salvation of her sons you know she was inspired to give that offering and God inspired to ask for her children God inspired her task for her children vendiga [Applause] [Music] thank you foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] they go foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music]
