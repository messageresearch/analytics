[24:33] presence of the Holy
[24:38] Spirit when he moves it's something that
[24:40] you don't want to get out of that

[24:46] awaiting one day to be with him
[24:51] eternally nothing will hinder us there
[24:54] won't be
[24:56] time able to have fellowship with one
[25:00] another for
[25:06] eternity as you're standing I'm going to
[25:09] invite you to open your
[25:12] scriptures to Second Kings chapter
[25:16] 1 from verse 1 to verse
[25:21] three and Jeremiah
[25:26] 8:22
[25:29] we're speaking with the theme getting
[25:30] closer to
[25:38] God we thank our pastor for the
[25:42] trust that he places in
[25:45] [Music]
[25:46] us we don't take it
[25:49] lightly it's a great
[25:53] responsibility what we will be speaking
[25:55] this uh
[25:56] morning
[26:02] the scripture says like this after
[26:04] ahab's death Moab rebelled against
[26:13] Israel and haah fell through the window
[26:15] of a room of the house that he had in
[26:23] Samaria and being sick he sent
[26:25] Messengers and said to them
[26:35] go and inquire of bbub God of Acron
[26:39] whether I am to be cured of this my
[26:51] illness then the angel of the Lord spoke
[26:53] to Elijah the tishbite saying arise and
[26:56] go up to meet the messenger of the king
[26:58] of
[27:06] Samaria and say unto them is there no
[27:09] God in Israel that you go to inquire of
[27:11] belzebub God of
[27:26] eon 8:22 says like this is there no bomb
[27:30] in Gilead isn't there a doctor there why
[27:34] then was there no medicine for the
[27:35] daughter of my
[27:38] people's pray Heavenly
[27:40] Father we put ourselves in your
[27:45] hands we put each person here in your
[27:49] hands that you would take control of
[27:53] us if there was something that would
[27:55] hinder
[27:56] us
[27:59] if we come troubled this morning to hear
[28:00] your
[28:03] word that we would set aside the
[28:05] problems of our daily
[28:09] lives because if we set those problems
[28:13] aside we will find the one that has the
[28:16] resolution to our
[28:18] problems and that is in your word
[28:22] Lord we ask this in the name of the Lord
[28:24] Jesus
[28:26] Christ amen uh you may be
[28:32] seated we're speaking on getting closer
[28:35] to
[28:39] God our pastor opened up the subject
[28:42] last
[28:44] week I don't know if you
[28:45] [Music]
[28:51] recall he uh named the title getting
[28:53] closer to
[28:55] him do do you recall
[29:00] brothers that he began to speak on
[29:07] Peter that Peter was a Christian only
[29:09] from a far
[29:11] off that's how our pastor begin to to
[29:15] talk so this
[29:20] morning I would like to focus on uh on
[29:23] the the way
[29:26] back there is a way that we can come
[29:29] back or
[29:30] return but before entering into
[29:35] that I would like to focus on a special
[29:42] point because from because that when you
[29:45] leave a
[29:48] place there was something that pulled
[29:51] you away from that
[29:56] place
[29:59] something happened in your life that
[30:01] pulled you away from the way of
[30:06] God I like what our pastor had
[30:10] said in the message closer to him he
[30:12] said
[30:15] this the Lord Jesus Christ had warned
[30:21] Peter the devil asked of you to to
[30:26] you or brother let me tell
[30:30] you the devil is going to come to shake
[30:34] you he's going to try to kill
[30:38] you the devil will always
[30:40] come he will try to find a
[30:44] way if you
[30:48] notice since the beginning the devil
[30:50] always tries to find
[30:53] way to pull you away from your lord
[30:57] there was Adam and
[30:59] Eve and he tried to separate catch this
[31:04] church the devil always tries to
[31:06] separate
[31:08] you because he knows
[31:10] that there is
[31:15] strength the devil tried to separate
[31:17] Adam from
[31:20] Eve found Eve in a weak moment in her
[31:23] life and he tried to
[31:26] separate the devil always tries to
[31:28] divide or
[31:29] separate we have to catch that this
[31:34] morning the Holy Spirit was speaking to
[31:37] me when the pastor was sharing
[31:41] this he was saying and and Peter pulled
[31:46] away something caused Peter to separate
[31:49] or pull
[31:52] away he began to pull
[31:56] away
[31:58] and and something that catches my
[31:59] attention is that
[32:02] Peter it says that Peter observed him
[32:04] from a far
[32:06] off it said he got to a place and he sat
[32:11] down to look at the end do you
[32:16] remember Peter was sitting
[32:19] there and you know he was a warming
[32:22] warming
[32:24] up then our pastor told
[32:30] how easy we we let go of what God has
[32:33] given us there was Peter he was
[32:37] comfortable he was warming up there amen
[32:43] amen and there are times in our
[32:52] lives the circumstances of our daily
[32:56] lives
[32:58] begin to separate us little by
[33:02] little and this morning I'm going to
[33:03] bring it very
[33:07] simple and sometimes the things that
[33:09] pull us away from the
[33:14] Lord is not understanding the great
[33:16] Mysteries that's not
[33:18] it the things that separate us from
[33:21] God I like what brother Garcia says
[33:25] here
[33:27] I'm going to read James 41
[33:36] first it says where do Wars and disputes
[33:38] among you come from catch this
[33:48] church sometimes the things that
[33:49] separate from the Lord aren't aren't the
[33:51] the supernatural
[33:54] things the things that afflict us
[33:57] amongst
[33:59] us the disputes that we have amongst
[34:03] ourselves are the simple
[34:05] things and the simple
[34:08] things are the ones that separate
[34:11] us the the Small
[34:16] Things is the today
[34:21] and he works in the same
[34:24] manner but don't forget
[34:28] is the
[34:30] same today
[34:33] until he tries to use the same
[34:36] strategy tries to
[34:38] separate separate you from your
[34:41] brother separate you from your
[34:43] sister separ from the
[34:45] husb separ from the
[34:48] wife
[34:50] from from the
[34:53] son that is the work of the devil to try
[34:56] try to divide
[34:58] us divide a
[35:01] family try to divide us
[35:04] Brothers we are a
[35:07] family this is a
[35:09] family I refer to a
[35:12] family refering
[35:15] to and I'm talking about the
[35:18] world the body of
[35:20] Christ of the Lord Jesus
[35:23] Christ not just the for
[35:25] church
[35:28] composed of a body from throughout the
[35:32] world and the devil always tries to
[35:34] separate because he
[35:37] knows if he is able to divide
[35:41] one he has the
[35:44] edge and he can have a greater
[35:51] effect Wars and disputes among you come
[35:55] from is it not your
[35:59] passions which war in your
[36:05] members sometimes we think the great
[36:07] things will separate us from the
[36:09] Lord It's the small
[36:14] things as small as it may
[36:17] seem the devil
[36:19] enters with a
[36:23] lie with such a small thing
[36:27] and when you least expect
[36:29] it you are there in your bed with the
[36:33] remote
[36:34] control time for
[36:36] service I don't want to go to
[36:39] church ACH
[36:41] hyoc talk about
[36:44] me am I speaking to anybody this
[36:48] morning that's the strategy of the devil
[36:51] that is the
[36:52] way that the devil pulls us away from
[36:55] God
[36:57] says
[36:58] this in the message fundamental
[37:07] Foundation God had placed him to govern
[37:10] so that he would have dominion so that
[37:11] he would be a superior being to other
[37:14] beings he's speaking about Adam
[37:19] here
[37:22] so so that he would be a superior being
[37:24] to other
[37:25] beings but he
[37:28] fell he lost
[37:30] Consciousness listen
[37:36] church he forgot the Reason God had put
[37:39] him
[37:43] here it's say if you have a house and
[37:45] your drain is clogged all
[37:50] over your plumbing is clogged you're
[37:52] back
[37:54] up so it has happened to our
[38:00] brains and all our channels have been
[38:04] blocked with
[38:06] what they have been
[38:09] blocked with business
[38:13] matters with our daily with our home
[38:18] life are you catching this
[38:22] church it's not that we don't understand
[38:24] things of the
[38:25] Bible
[38:27] it's
[38:31] simple when Adam and Eve were
[38:36] there Elohim would come
[38:39] down and he fellow with
[38:42] them he had fellowship
[38:45] with he talked to
[38:49] him I don't know how long they would
[38:55] talk and then and then he would he would
[39:04] come uh
[39:08] look and and Adam could speak with
[39:12] God and there was a
[39:17] conversation but the devil entered and
[39:19] began to
[39:21] divide and how did he
[39:23] Enter he entered through sin
[39:27] and sin separates you from
[39:30] God sin will always separate you from
[39:33] God catch this
[39:38] church but God still loves The
[39:42] Sinner one thing is s and the other
[39:45] thing is The
[39:47] Sinner and the Lord will continue loving
[39:51] you despite how low you've
[39:55] got how low you
[39:59] are there in your life or your soul or
[40:02] your
[40:04] being even if you're sick of
[40:09] sin that doesn't matter to
[40:12] God he continues
[40:16] loving he is still waiting for
[40:20] you he is providing a way so that you
[40:23] can come
[40:25] back
[40:28] provides the way
[40:30] back that you can come
[40:34] back accept the provided Way by
[40:38] him God always has a
[40:42] way the problem is me accepting that
[40:46] way the word of God is not the
[40:49] problem the problem is
[40:53] me accept the way back
[41:00] now this
[41:02] message this precious
[41:05] message brought us
[41:09] back message came to restore all
[41:13] things it came to
[41:15] restore what had been lost in the
[41:23] beginning but why don't we see the the
[41:26] the the Wonders or
[41:27] Miracles
[41:29] one is because we are always in the in
[41:32] the flesh are very
[41:34] carnal
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:38] amen it's the
[41:42] truth how do we want to feel the spirit
[41:44] of God when we're in the
[41:49] flesh when we
[41:51] come we come through those doors we
[41:53] should come with a humble
[41:55] heart
[41:57] and a something from
[42:00] him he will always
[42:03] answer he will always
[42:07] answer he always fulfills his
[42:12] word so brother Garcia continues
[42:20] saying they have has been blocked with
[42:23] business
[42:25] matters the ways that God
[42:28] has so that he could speak to us they
[42:32] are
[42:35] blocked they're not blocked with
[42:37] something Supernatural
[42:39] super they are blocked with simple
[42:42] matters your your life there in your
[42:46] home how do you live in your
[42:50] home that's why your channels are
[42:54] blocked but God designed man in a
[42:56] perfect way
[43:01] now it says with the life of our home
[43:03] with
[43:11] dom it's so blocked until God can no
[43:13] longer operate through uh those
[43:22] channels brother BR says this in the
[43:25] message
[43:28] God provides a
[43:30] way aren't you happy for
[43:37] that that we can be in the dumps on the
[43:41] floor and we just we just you know throw
[43:44] in the towel per
[43:50] se but he always
[43:55] comes
[44:06] you could be in in the
[44:12] dumps since we are born we are we are
[44:15] born
[44:16] broken we are Tor to
[44:21] Pieces many of us have come from a from
[44:24] a you know a family where it's a broken
[44:27] home my family was was
[44:30] separated my my parents they they
[44:32] divorced they
[44:35] separated what hope did I
[44:38] have I begin to meditate on it and I say
[44:43] father thank
[44:44] you because by your grace and your love
[44:47] we are
[44:52] here thousands and thousands of miles
[44:55] separated from him
[45:01] God provides a
[45:03] way and we refuse
[45:08] it that is a sad
[45:11] thing that we don't want God's provided
[45:15] way God tells
[45:18] us do it this way
[45:21] son and I'll bring it even more it's
[45:24] easier than that
[45:29] it's not that an angel's going to come
[45:31] down and appear before
[45:34] you God has a plan on how he
[45:37] works okay
[45:41] okay so God has his his Shepherd or
[45:45] Pastor that he could counsel and let you
[45:51] know no you're not going to see a
[45:53] fleshly or carnal
[45:54] man because the fleshly man will will
[45:57] fail
[46:01] you but when you filter the thing and
[46:03] you see Beyond the
[46:05] Veil when you can see Beyond the
[46:09] Veil oh Brothers the blessings of God
[46:12] will be
[46:14] there the way God works that's way he
[46:18] provides for his
[46:24] people
[46:27] but we refuse
[46:28] it we don't want
[46:34] it we don't want the way of the
[46:39] Lord because perhaps it's not how I want
[46:45] it but by the grace of
[46:50] God along with the other youth leaders
[46:53] uh you know we work with the youth
[46:57] and we
[47:00] see that that that we let them know to
[47:02] do things a certain
[47:05] way and uh they they don't want
[47:09] it but that's
[47:11] fine I was a young man once
[47:16] too and I didn't put in both feet I put
[47:18] in all four of my
[47:22] feet I believe the Lord allowed me to go
[47:25] through certain things in my
[47:27] life so that I would be able to
[47:29] understand the youth not just the
[47:33] youth but be able to be able to
[47:35] understand my brother and
[47:42] sister and this morning I would like to
[47:45] speak
[47:51] on 20 minutes uh to speak on the thought
[47:54] that I I would like to share is that
[47:56] fine with
[48:00] you when we speak on the things of the
[48:04] Lord for many it may seem a little
[48:08] heavy but others really enjoy
[48:13] it because there's not a better place to
[48:15] be than to be hearing God's
[48:18] word we are privileged
[48:21] people the day will
[48:23] come the day will come
[48:26] where this will all shut down the day
[48:29] will come brother that's why you should
[48:32] Rejoice right now while you rejoice that
[48:35] God has
[48:37] provided let us
[48:43] rejoice I'm gonna be focusing on
[48:48] aiah aah was a king of
[48:53] Israel he was the son of Ahab
[48:57] and
[49:01] Jezebel remember the thought
[49:04] Brothers the way
[49:07] back God provides a
[49:11] way so that we can
[49:14] understand I'm going to give you a
[49:15] little bit a
[49:18] context this
[49:21] King remember his mother was
[49:24] Jezebel and his his father was Ahab
[49:29] Ahab was a king of
[49:31] Israel the scripture
[49:33] says that he was an
[49:38] Israelite the scripture says that he did
[49:41] contrary to God's
[49:47] will he went and married a pagan
[49:51] woman whose name was
[49:54] Jezebel
[49:56] now this this
[49:59] couple they they had a
[50:03] child the the scripture say that he had
[50:06] like 70
[50:08] children Ahab had 70
[50:13] children so amongst them was this King
[50:23] haah I would like to share what brother
[50:26] Brandon shared here in the way
[50:30] back and haaiah did the same
[50:36] thing he was like many of us
[50:42] today he was just very
[50:47] stubborn how many can identify with
[50:52] that it was brother
[50:54] Fidel
[50:56] and it's like he still wants to go back
[50:58] but but you know I I calm down but we're
[51:02] working
[51:05] Brothers there are many things that I
[51:08] don't like of
[51:10] myself I look at myself I'm like oh
[51:13] Lord help my
[51:16] wife because
[51:20] unfortunately well fortunately that's
[51:22] the best thing that God could give
[51:24] us that's
[51:25] that God could give me was my
[51:30] wife many times we we harm
[51:34] them how many can identify with
[51:43] that he was like many of us
[51:46] today he was just very
[51:48] stubborn he just didn't want to do
[51:51] it
[51:54] however
[51:56] he knew that Elijah was there in the
[51:59] desert I'm be speaking a little bit on
[52:01] this
[52:02] King this King had had had
[52:07] fallen his his
[52:09] mother says that he had he had a fall
[52:13] she fell that she had
[52:18] fallen dogs licked up her blood now her
[52:22] son he also fell
[52:26] he fell through a
[52:31] window so heill and he was on the verge
[52:34] of
[52:35] death and the scripture
[52:38] says that he got some of his
[52:43] servants he sent
[52:46] them and he sent them to the to the
[52:49] place of
[52:54] acon where there was an idol by the name
[52:56] of
[52:57] bbub how many recall who bbub
[53:01] is our Lord Jesus
[53:04] Christ that he was a
[53:08] belah they told the Lord Jesus
[53:12] Christ so this King sends his
[53:18] servants to to see if I will find
[53:23] Healing now this is the way
[53:27] when you are separated from
[53:31] God the way that we live many times when
[53:33] we're separated from
[53:37] God we want to seek an answer in the
[53:40] wrong
[53:41] place when you seek for an
[53:45] answer uh watch who you counsel
[53:49] with because it can help
[53:51] you or it could send you to hell
[53:59] so they
[54:01] sent the
[54:03] servants and there was
[54:06] Elijah on the
[54:11] mountain so the angel of the Lord
[54:13] appeared to Elijah and
[54:17] says Elijah
[54:22] arise and he began to share with him
[54:24] what King had been
[54:27] planning so Elijah appears to
[54:31] them to the servants the king had
[54:35] said and he said tell your
[54:39] Lord that he will not uh get up from
[54:42] this
[54:43] illness he will not get up from the bed
[54:46] catch this
[54:50] church because he is seeking counsel in
[54:54] the wrong place
[54:56] he will not get
[54:58] better they
[55:01] returned and the King asked the
[55:04] servants what had
[55:05] [Music]
[55:09] happened we saw a man that was that was
[55:11] like this like this
[55:15] describ and The King The King asked you
[55:17] know for a
[55:21] description had he had the sheep skins
[55:24] wrapped around
[55:26] and and
[55:29] notice when you know to do what's
[55:33] right and because of your
[55:36] stubbornness because I know all
[55:40] things I don't need the five-fold
[55:43] ministry I don't need the pastor that's
[55:46] okay I can do it okay that's
[55:54] fine
[55:56] so this
[56:01] fellow to describe how this man looked
[56:04] and they're like oh that's elij he said
[56:06] that's Elijah
[56:08] Elijah but due to his
[56:10] pride it's okay he said
[56:15] that's he he didn't want that
[56:20] way and he sent another group of 50 men
[56:26] and Elijah appeared before them as
[56:31] well they even told Elijah men of God we
[56:34] we want to speak to
[56:39] you said if I'm if if if I'm a Ser of
[56:42] the Lord may may may lightning come from
[56:45] Heaven and the the 50 they they died
[56:48] that right didn't there and they they
[56:51] they they died and
[56:53] notice
[56:55] because they were trying to seek counsel
[56:56] in a way in a
[56:59] place we also affect a second and third
[57:03] parties due to our
[57:05] decisions and he sent another Army of
[57:08] men and what what do you think
[57:11] happened the same thing he told
[57:15] them he let them
[57:20] know this is
[57:22] tremendous they did not they didn't
[57:24] present themselves in a bad
[57:27] way but
[57:30] Elijah but he said
[57:33] okay that the king wanted to see him
[57:40] again and lightning come down from or
[57:43] fire came down from heaven and consumed
[57:44] these men as well notice catch
[57:49] this the attitude is very
[57:53] important so he sends another group of
[57:56] men
[57:58] another another
[58:00] 50 but what do you think this man
[58:03] did he went and he kned before him my
[58:06] Lord he
[58:10] said 50 after
[58:13] 50 and the fire had consumed them before
[58:16] this man
[58:18] arrived but he this man said have mercy
[58:20] upon
[58:23] me
[58:26] amen have mercy upon
[58:32] me and of the men that come with
[58:36] me and he told the
[58:40] Lord he said he said
[58:44] go Elijah told him to
[58:48] go because they will not harm you I told
[58:53] Elijah
[58:55] it it matters how you approach
[58:58] God Elijah was coming and he
[59:04] said he said he told him that he would
[59:06] not get up from the
[59:10] illness because you counseled with other
[59:16] Gods Not bombing
[59:20] Gilead why do we counsel other
[59:23] people
[59:25] why do we counsel with other
[59:28] people he he would he
[59:32] said is God the god of Israel not
[59:34] amongst the people of
[59:37] Israel God always has
[59:40] somebody to guide his people
[59:47] always the person is always stubborn and
[59:50] they seek what they
[59:53] desire
[59:55] and when they're in the very thck of the
[59:58] problem start calling the pastor right
[1:00:03] away and here comes the
[1:00:05] grace and here comes
[1:00:09] Grace our pastor not going to come well
[1:00:12] he hasn't done that to
[1:00:14] me but the Grace will be extended at
[1:00:17] that
[1:00:21] point that's why many times the children
[1:00:23] of God are criticized
[1:00:26] because they show
[1:00:28] Grace because the people have not
[1:00:31] understood that
[1:00:33] God that was in the
[1:00:37] heavens cre the heavens and the
[1:00:39] Earth he came and became a
[1:00:43] human fles in a man named Jesus he came
[1:00:47] and
[1:00:48] said I will not leave you
[1:00:51] comforta I will send the Holy Spirit
[1:00:58] you and he came in a man he doesn't come
[1:01:02] through
[1:01:04] Angels he comes in a man in human
[1:01:09] form in human
[1:01:14] flesh how many are rejoicing with the
[1:01:20] word we're closing
[1:01:23] now
[1:01:25] it doesn't
[1:01:28] matter what we have done
[1:01:35] Brothers there is a way
[1:01:43] back I'm going to tell you the provided
[1:01:50] way those that have been
[1:01:53] lost those of us that have been
[1:01:56] lost and we have been forgiven for
[1:02:01] much
[1:02:03] Lord we all love
[1:02:09] much it
[1:02:13] says look I'm going to tell you the way
[1:02:16] to get
[1:02:17] back if you want to
[1:02:21] return you must get inoculated
[1:02:27] what is that word
[1:02:32] inoculated in other words it's to become
[1:02:35] immune to get a
[1:02:41] vaccine you must administer the balm of
[1:02:45] God the serum of
[1:02:48] God he has
[1:02:51] it it's a double cure for sin
[1:02:56] the blood of Jesus
[1:02:58] Christ the son of
[1:03:01] God the baptism of the Holy Spirit he
[1:03:05] cleanses from
[1:03:07] sin and fills them for
[1:03:11] service aren't you happy for the Holy
[1:03:13] Spirit
[1:03:15] brothers that Holy
[1:03:18] Spirit where you come and the Holy
[1:03:20] Spirit fills
[1:03:22] you he come and anoint
[1:03:26] and he puts you into
[1:03:29] action I don't the
[1:03:32] spirit if
[1:03:33] you if you're doubting you don't have
[1:03:37] it you have it you're like
[1:03:40] oh the doors of the church have
[1:03:43] opened I'm going to run into
[1:03:46] them when there's something to
[1:03:49] do there has to be something burning in
[1:03:51] your
[1:03:53] heart
[1:03:55] puts you into action
[1:03:57] service the Holy Spirit
[1:03:59] activates it doesn't let you stay
[1:04:02] still that's why when
[1:04:06] Paul when Paul met the pillar of
[1:04:09] fire he was a religious man catched his
[1:04:13] church when the Holy Spirit
[1:04:18] came opened the first
[1:04:21] Doctrine he didn't open it with the
[1:04:23] sinners
[1:04:25] catch
[1:04:27] this when he came and said you have you
[1:04:29] must be born
[1:04:31] again he came and brought it to a
[1:04:33] religious
[1:04:38] person he didn't bring it to the
[1:04:42] Sinners he brought it to the religious
[1:04:45] people to
[1:04:50] Nicodemus so that you would be able to
[1:04:52] understand the kingdom of God
[1:04:56] so that you can understand or
[1:04:58] see you have to be born
[1:05:02] again there has to be a
[1:05:04] death there has to be a
[1:05:09] massacre not in this fleshly
[1:05:12] body but in your
[1:05:14] desires you have to begin to
[1:05:17] kill
[1:05:20] kill those thoughts that come to
[1:05:23] you want to separate you from
[1:05:25] God you have to start killing
[1:05:29] yourself
[1:05:31] not the
[1:05:33] mirror and see all your bad
[1:05:36] things you don't want to go to
[1:05:38] church you start killing
[1:05:41] yourself start killing
[1:05:44] your your own
[1:05:47] desires you're own I want to do
[1:05:51] this say I no longer chis live but
[1:05:54] Christ liveth in
[1:05:56] me but many are still still
[1:06:01] living because it's when it's no longer
[1:06:03] you
[1:06:09] living these uh hands become his
[1:06:17] hands this becomes his
[1:06:23] mouth
[1:06:26] but why do we curse and things of this
[1:06:31] nature because this is not his
[1:06:36] mouth there has to be a a a a
[1:06:42] killing and remember the the the killing
[1:06:44] Begins the sacrifice begins here at the
[1:06:47] altar if you want to return this
[1:06:52] morning there is bomb in
[1:06:57] Gilead when I say there's bomb in
[1:07:01] Gilead I am letting you know that there
[1:07:03] is
[1:07:06] medicine anything that is happening in
[1:07:08] our
[1:07:10] lives any problem or sickness or
[1:07:12] whatever it may
[1:07:14] be brothers the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:18] Christ it takes away every
[1:07:22] stain but the most important thing here
[1:07:25] is
[1:07:26] you that you would
[1:07:29] accept that you would say yes
[1:07:33] Lord I am a
[1:07:36] sinner that's the first thing we have to
[1:07:39] do that's why the Lord told
[1:07:43] Nicodemus because Nicodemus thought he
[1:07:45] was the last Coca-Cola in the
[1:07:48] desert and when we're we spend a lot of
[1:07:50] time in church we we we we think we're
[1:07:52] something
[1:07:52] special
[1:07:56] but many are here in the church and have
[1:07:58] the message but the message has in you
[1:08:02] in me in
[1:08:03] me that's the way there's a way
[1:08:07] back and that is the way
[1:08:10] back why don't you
[1:08:12] stand and give the Holy Spirit a Round
[1:08:14] of
[1:08:15] Applause Just say

[1:09:07] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:09:09] Christ for the remission of your
[1:09:13] sins you shall receive the gift of the

[1:40:36] home if I can say just this little
[1:40:40] bit the first time I came here there's
[1:40:43] something special
[1:40:46] here I've never experienced such great
[1:40:49] love
[1:40:51] when my wife and I came for the first
[1:40:53] time we live very
[1:40:58] happy because of certain circumstances
[1:41:00] we came to this
[1:41:05] place my
[1:41:08] brother-in Throne of
[1:41:11] God everything has a
[1:41:16] purpose that was the motive and the
[1:41:17] reason why we came to for
[1:41:19] cins
[1:41:23] but we live very happy and we felt that
[1:41:25] great
[1:41:26] love God bless you
[1:41:28] Brothers let us continue praying for
[1:41:30] each
[1:41:32] other we need of
[1:41:36] you we need for you to pray for us and
[1:41:39] we shall pray for you as
[1:41:43] well if I say something in
[1:41:46] particular I am a
[1:41:49] witness
[1:41:51] of what God is doing now in these
[1:41:55] times sometimes we don't see it we're
[1:41:57] focusing in the past and what God has
[1:42:02] done or what God is going to
[1:42:04] do but sometimes we we let it passes
[1:42:08] by what he's doing now in this
[1:42:12] moment I'm a witness of a restored
[1:42:16] matrimony marriage a restored
[1:42:19] marriage and I will not be
[1:42:23] silenced from now on
[1:42:26] forward till God allows me to be here on
[1:42:29] this Earth I will
[1:42:32] testify of what God does from
[1:42:36] nothing he raises us he lifts us
[1:42:39] up and there's a way to return back the
[1:42:44] message God has provided a
[1:42:48] way I found the way back Brothers
[1:42:54] if I can express myself a little
[1:42:58] bit what is the reaction of when someone
[1:43:00] wins the
[1:43:02] lottery what would be your
[1:43:05] reaction would you be
[1:43:08] sad I million and let's see what happens
[1:43:12] no
[1:43:16] no I feel more happier than having won
[1:43:19] the because He restored my
[1:43:23] life the preaching of our
[1:43:26] pastor this morning spoke of
[1:43:28] Lazarus I took it
[1:43:31] personally I was dead four
[1:43:35] years I was
[1:43:37] dead I heard his
[1:43:43] voice when I came out of that
[1:43:46] tomb no one wanted to talk to me you
[1:43:49] know why
[1:43:51] because I
[1:43:55] smelled know when Lazarus came out he
[1:43:59] smelled and then he came out all bound I
[1:44:02] came all
[1:44:06] bounds and when I came to four
[1:44:12] Callins
[1:44:15] those they were unwrapping
[1:44:19] me I was experiencing Divine love here
[1:44:22] in this
[1:44:23] place my wife is a
[1:44:28] witness that you have given me so much
[1:44:33] love if you allow
[1:44:35] me there's a quote I want to I have in
[1:44:38] my you give me a
[1:44:49] second
[1:44:52] and as the days get closer and closer
[1:44:58] by my sight is failing
[1:45:05] me and the road becomes more
[1:45:09] narrow
[1:45:12] we we want to walk more
[1:45:16] together so we should become
[1:45:19] one one
[1:45:22] body we should move
[1:45:26] together forgetting forgetting each
[1:45:29] other's
[1:45:31] sins and our
[1:45:37] differences getting us closer and
[1:45:41] closer to such a point we're getting
[1:45:43] closer to that
[1:45:45] day
[1:45:47] Gathering all
[1:45:49] unanimously
[1:45:51] and from one
[1:45:53] heart and if one
[1:45:55] brother or one
[1:45:58] sister deviates from the
[1:46:00] road do not criticize
[1:46:06] him whichever
[1:46:09] way we don't do
[1:46:12] anything but pray for that
[1:46:16] person in
[1:46:19] love
[1:46:22] always considering each
[1:46:23] other never
[1:46:27] allow that one of you guys departer away
[1:46:31] stay together and if you
[1:46:34] can add more to
[1:46:36] it constantly all the
[1:46:40] time I believe it with all my
[1:46:43] heart the time is drying
[1:46:46] n everything is going to come to an
[1:46:49] end our pastor was talking about
[1:46:53] tears I believe we've all shed tears of
[1:46:56] sadness of
[1:46:59] pain I've been dis disappointed many
[1:47:04] people and even then uh the Lord took
[1:47:06] away my
[1:47:09] shame without him I am
[1:47:12] nothing and because of him I am
[1:47:16] here I see eye to eye face to
[1:47:19] face before I couldn't do that but that
[1:47:22] day on
[1:47:23] Calvary he took my
[1:47:28] place the Bible says
[1:47:31] he and he gave us everything
[1:47:35] with one of the things of the money he
[1:47:37] gave us was his
[1:47:42] forgiveness our salvation and eternal
