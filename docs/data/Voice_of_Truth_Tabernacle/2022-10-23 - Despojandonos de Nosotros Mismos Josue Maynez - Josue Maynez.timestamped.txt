[35:31] I'm just trying to to just calm down
[35:34] Brothers
[35:38] and we're happy to be in this place hey
[35:43] is
[35:45] we are fighting the same five brothers
[35:49] the same as the same battles the same
[35:53] trials
[35:55] but we also have the same God that helps
[35:59] us
[36:04] towards us isn't that right
[36:08] now I'm going to read the scripture once
[36:10] again
[36:12] just follow me
[36:17] let us mind being you which was also in
[36:20] Christ
[36:22] what we're feeling was there in Christ
[36:24] Jesus
[36:27] Watch what it says
[36:42] but made himself of no reputation
[36:47] how many this morning
[36:51] want to just uh let go of yourself
[36:56] because God despair not
[36:59] God didn't think about it
[37:02] was the god of Eternity
[37:05] he was the creator of everything
[37:09] no doubt everything obeyed him
[37:13] his creation was proud of him
[37:17] notice Brothers
[37:19] [Music]
[37:22] he would go through where the trees were
[37:24] is
[37:28] that tree felt a great
[37:30] way
[37:31] notice Brothers
[37:34] you feel this morning
[37:39] where two or three were gathered
[37:42] he would be in here in their midst
[37:46] there's not a devil that could stand
[37:48] before you
[37:49] there's not a sickness
[37:52] foreign
[38:38] like him
[38:40] that's right
[38:42] isn't that right Brothers
[38:46] k a
[38:48] question
[38:49] this is the day this is the moment
[38:55] that we need to be like him
[39:00] you know you're on a pistol or a letter
[39:04] there are people in the world
[39:07] they take no interest
[39:10] and taking hold of a Bible
[39:13] come on now
[39:14] man that's right
[39:16] you talk to them about the Bible and
[39:19] they say and what do you say
[39:22] it's a waste of time they
[39:26] see a Bible in the form of Flesh
[39:31] a great way in the lives of men
[39:37] o isn't that right Brothers
[39:41] in other words
[39:53] you're very life
[40:07] not just in our church
[40:12] not just with our own
[40:19] also at our jobs
[40:25] I want to title this message
[40:31] letting go of ourselves
[40:36] how many want to let go of yourselves
[40:39] the chairman of War Brothers
[40:42] of our ideas
[40:48] of our way of seeing the Bible
[40:52] we want to see it
[40:56] Through The Eyes Of God foreign
[41:12] he wants to know where we're standing
[41:17] because we are about the effects
[41:22] on the way how many I know that Brothers
[41:33] of all times
[41:38] of the church
[41:42] so so it's it's convenient for us
[41:46] to know where we're standing
[41:50] you know the messenger says
[41:55] there's something that's going to show
[41:56] us where we're standing it's this book
[41:59] that says what's this word
[42:05] something that's going to show you and I
[42:07] yes sir
[42:10] now there's a lot of books that can be
[42:12] real
[42:13] buenos that could be good now that
[42:16] Contra is home nothing against that
[42:19] but we have the Assurance
[42:23] this book is completely the truth
[42:27] right Brothers
[42:29] amen amen glory to God
[42:32] now
[42:36] do you know God left us the example
[42:40] remember Brothers
[42:44] letting go of ourselves
[42:48] but when we let go of ourselves
[42:51] we have to fill ourselves with something
[42:57] so there has to be a pouring out
[43:01] so has to be a Feeling
[43:16] what are you feeling yourself with
[43:18] foreign
[43:37] yourself out
[43:40] but we have to be careful Brothers
[43:46] of what are we filling ourselves with
[43:50] you know
[43:52] and we this this hour
[43:55] we have a great example
[44:00] is Jesus Christ
[44:10] he's not a better model to follow
[44:13] Persona there's not a better person
[44:17] we can name many prophets
[44:25] we have to go to the peak a river to of
[44:29] the higher
[44:36] the messenger
[44:40] dios Jesus Christ he said when when God
[44:44] sent Jesus Christ
[44:48] he sent them in order for him to be our
[44:51] role model
[44:53] we're not going to enter into that
[44:55] subject
[44:56] because there's other people that take
[44:58] different Role Models
[45:00] even even Christians
[45:02] but remember Brothers
[45:07] when God said Jesus Christ
[45:11] he said to him so that he would be his
[45:15] Role
[45:17] Models
[45:18] when he reflected his life through the
[45:21] word
[45:22] he told us
[45:25] what we should be
[45:28] notice Brothers
[45:34] yourself in the mirror
[45:48] do you see a man that's going directly
[45:50] into the right
[45:53] because in this hour brother
[45:58] identified with him
[46:02] her brother Isaac was saying
[46:06] six years ago that he said
[46:10] it's later than we think
[46:14] 60 years back Brothers
[46:16] what about today
[46:22] you need to live a life Brothers
[46:25] if he were to come this morning
[46:29] how much would how many would raise
[46:31] their hands
[46:34] how many would raise their hand yeah
[46:41] because he is our example
[46:45] and we want to identify with him and
[46:48] Manu
[47:10] with chariots
[47:14] could have come with angels
[47:30] could have put everything on his feet
[47:50] [Music]
[47:52] the angel would be there
[47:56] everything obeyed him
[48:08] come on
[48:19] how should we repay that love
[48:24] just think about what I'm saying
[48:28] with the life that we're that we have
[48:31] come up with yes
[48:33] how could we repay that love
[48:38] Hermano
[48:40] and don't say
[48:42] so what example did he leave us
[48:46] how would our life reflect
[48:55] notice Brothers
[49:00] he spared not
[49:03] his whole Kingdom
[49:08] let's go to that to that picture
[49:14] you could have come Brothers
[49:19] with the Legion of angels
[49:22] but what did he say
[49:25] he says the fox that doesn't have a hole
[49:30] Hermano
[49:45] Lotus Brothers
[49:53] now how should we be Hermano
[49:56] study
[50:01] just ask yourself
[50:04] you know what he did
[50:08] you let go of how great he was
[50:15] let go of the crown
[50:19] he came in the way of a Manger
[50:22] that was his love towards you
[50:25] yes
[50:27] the Lord that humbled itself to the
[50:30] lowest thing
[50:34] in order to give you life
[50:48] now in order to to let go
[50:52] of character is required
[50:59] in order to let go of yourself
[51:04] a character is required
[51:11] it's in his character
[51:14] look at yourself
[51:18] what type of character do you have
[51:22] because we're letting go
[51:28] have you become like him Hermano
[51:33] um
[51:33] have you become like him this is
[51:39] you could stand before the presence of
[51:42] God
[51:43] or could we stand before the presence of
[51:45] God
[51:47] there's not a way to do it wow
[51:52] there's just one way to do it
[51:57] the perfect sacrifice Hermano
[52:06] but with our own works
[52:13] we recognize the works of the Lord Jesus
[52:15] Christ
[52:17] that sacrifice
[52:19] that was accepted
[52:21] he himself says
[52:24] this is my beloved Son
[52:27] and whom I am well please
[52:31] so what do you have to do
[52:34] you have to accept
[52:37] the person of Jesus Christ
[52:42] there has to be a death
[52:47] in order for you to bring life
[52:51] notice Brothers
[52:54] letting go of ourselves
[52:58] how many want to let go of yourselves
[53:02] [Music]
[53:08] you know in him there was no blemish
[53:18] there was nothing that he could be
[53:20] accused of
[53:22] it
[53:24] he would stand before the intellectual
[53:27] people
[53:30] for the people that that knew about the
[53:34] gospel
[53:38] and he would say who can't blame me of
[53:40] sin
[53:42] is
[53:44] but yet even saying those words
[53:49] he suffered so much like like just like
[53:52] any man
[53:54] he was despised
[53:57] he was mocked
[54:01] he was persecuted
[54:04] and the question is
[54:06] what did he do
[54:09] aliens
[54:12] okay stand before him and point a finger
[54:16] at him
[54:18] they wanted to have something right
[54:24] you don't think they would have filled
[54:26] their mouths
[54:28] there was accusations
[55:00] he was letting go of himself
[55:03] foreign
[55:37] Hermano
[55:39] no serrated
[55:41] maybe he scratches our head with us as
[55:44] well
[55:45] yes here is he not
[55:47] Hermano
[55:52] yeah
[55:54] now we can't produce that character
[55:57] Hermano
[55:59] Wright brothers
[56:03] or a church can't give it to us
[56:06] Hermano
[56:07] who created a Creed can't do it
[56:12] a denomination can't do it
[56:16] we can't obtain it through education
[56:25] there has to be a verse
[56:30] for you to have the character of the
[56:32] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[56:37] so that's when you allow him to enter
[56:44] Then you become Sons and Daughters of
[56:46] God
[56:48] notice Brothers
[56:52] now let's analyze a point
[56:55] notice Brothers
[57:00] because we're learning of that character
[57:05] because if we are emptying ourselves out
[57:09] then we have to fill ourselves with
[57:11] something right
[57:16] we have to analyze the character of our
[57:19] Lord Jesus Christ
[57:21] what did he do
[57:23] know
[57:27] his throne
[57:31] he took form of a
[57:33] servantes
[57:36] characteristics it behooves us to uh to
[57:39] to look at those characteristics
[57:41] and apply them to our lives
[57:47] now when uh when Christ went up to
[57:50] Golgotha
[57:52] he had been mistreated
[57:55] he had been whipped
[57:58] he had he had been a crushed
[58:02] and you know why they did that
[58:06] in order
[58:10] he allowed those things
[58:16] he said that's how they had the devil
[58:18] confused
[58:22] right brother amen
[58:25] is he or is he not
[58:28] no point it can't be God
[58:32] would not allow this
[58:36] God wouldn't allow it
[58:39] and those soldiers
[58:45] slapping them
[58:48] put a crown of thorns upon himself
[58:51] the word says
[58:56] He was taken to the salon what did he do
[59:00] he he spoke not
[59:03] he did not open his mouth
[59:09] and me
[59:12] [Applause]
[59:16] the devil was confused
[59:20] if he were God
[59:24] he wouldn't allow this
[59:26] notice Brothers
[59:31] but many people weren't aware or
[59:34] conscious
[59:36] of what they were doing to Jesus
