[22:53] a pleasure for me

[23:02] I identify myself with them
[23:05] it's just funny how life passes like in
[23:09] a blink of an eye
[23:13] I still remember my twenties right
[23:20] 40.
[23:22] I'm living them so
[23:25] um
[23:28] uh I wanna just
[23:31] I felt you know or led by the spirit to
[23:35] speak in English because
[23:39] that's how I identify myself with the
[23:42] youth for Humanity
[23:45] English not my first language
[23:49] I got a tank brother Bernie for teach me
[23:52] English
[23:53] uh brother Bernie yeah
[23:57] oh he forced me to learn it um
[24:02] if you see me cry a lot

[24:09] so thankful with God for saving me Salvo
[24:15] so

[24:28] it what are we talking about the judges
[24:33] and I said okay okay well well you just
[24:38] tell me one you know because I noticed
[24:39] that you already spoke about one the
[24:42] first three judges right
[24:47] this is up to you you know it could be
[24:50] something you say Samsung said that's me
[24:52] right there
[24:57] yeah I will identify myself
[25:02] with Thompson and basically what I want
[25:06] to do tonight is
[25:08] my testimony testimonial through the
[25:11] life of sensor
[25:14] so let's go to Judges 13 chapter 13.
[25:22] and then we can start on on the third uh
[25:28] Birds comments
[25:31] and my friend here Isaac Hill was saying
[25:36] in English and then in Spanish
[25:38] in Espanol
[25:41] uh this is
[25:52] and the angel of the Lord appearance to
[25:54] the woman and said unto her behold now
[25:56] Thou Art Barren and bear is not but Thou
[25:59] shalt conceive and bear a son

[26:04] our Quest noveles

[26:37] shall be a Nazarite unto God from the
[26:39] wound and he shall begin to deliver
[26:41] Israel out of the hand of the
[26:43] Philistines
[26:46] heavenly father father celestial
[26:50] I'm just being obedient
[26:57] thank you for thy Grace gracias
[27:00] thank you for your mercy gracias
[27:04] thank you for allowing me to get to know
[27:08] this
[27:09] this uh part of the Bride graciasport
[27:14] Lord I'm really in love with them
[27:18] as my brother
[27:23] Laura now I ask you to
[27:27] work through my Lord
[27:32] might say something out of your work
[27:36] only that might help you
[27:39] people
[27:42] uh it's called these things in the name
[27:44] of the Lord
[27:52] I was I had the opportunity on on
[28:01] Sundays right and I was telling them a
[28:03] little bit about my life
[28:07] I was born and raised in the message
[28:09] right
[28:14] um
[28:15] since I remember
[28:18] I always heard about brother Branham
[28:23] and about brother Bernie is and so many
[28:27] other Ministries
[28:31] and and
[28:34] I see that that this is just kind of
[28:36] like with with this Samsung
[28:39] it's about the same thing with Samsung
[28:41] is
[28:44] you know um if you've read the whole 13
[28:48] 14 you know all those chapters that talk
[28:50] about sounds
[28:53] I'm gonna just condense all that uh you
[28:59] know he was born under a bow you know it
[29:03] was
[29:04] that word Nazareth Nazarite Nazarite
[29:10] you know and he was promised to conquer
[29:13] like the Philistines
[29:17] you know
[29:19] um but he had a weakness
[29:22] he didn't he didn't even know that he
[29:24] had that wish
[29:28] still things happen
[29:30] and that's what happened normally
[29:33] happens to the youth yes
[29:36] no sometimes we think that we're so
[29:39] strong I always expect
[29:41] we like to brag about it
[29:48] you know and and it will look in our
[29:51] lives and it's like I got no weakness
[29:54] what was that and then we we just like
[29:57] search our life and we we think like we
[29:59] have no weakness
[30:00] is
[30:06] what might not know of you know like we
[30:10] might not know of but
[30:13] the devil knows or weakness
[30:18] and as I remember
[30:21] and I would say this story
[30:24] uh just to leave a brother Bernie's
[30:27] house
[30:32] you know I used to live there so
[30:35] I remember brother Bernie telling us
[30:39] because we used to help them in
[30:41] everything
[30:43] we used to sometimes cook because wash
[30:47] the dishes
[30:49] taking the elderly to like like you know
[30:52] going to their houses bringing them to
[30:54] church and taking them back to yeah
[31:01] but that was not enough for brotherberg
[31:05] I remember he was telling he used to
[31:07] gather like five of us like five guys
[31:12] at the table
[31:14] and he was like oh my God what am I
[31:17] going to do with you guys
[31:20] man like a girl can do
[31:23] like like would you guys fight with the
[31:25] Five Guys do it you know
[31:28] I knew it was just like Sally God didn't
[31:31] call the women
[31:33] amenities
[31:35] no so I had to bear with you guys
[31:39] and that was tough
[31:42] yeah that was tough
[31:45] because we always trying to please the
[31:48] man of God
[31:51] and I guess that's the the feeling that
[31:55] the Son of God has always turned to
[31:57] please God
[32:01] but when he sees the men of God
[32:04] he wants to please that me or help that
[32:08] ministry
[32:10] as I've seen a lot of you guys doing
[32:13] that with brother Jesus ministry
[32:18] and I really I love that yeah because I
[32:22] see myself fact that you know when we
[32:24] used to death brother Bernie okay
[32:30] so here's Samson
[32:33] Samson known that he was the son of God
[32:37] he was an Israelite israelita you know
[32:42] he knew that God was always on his side
[32:46] and that's the way we feel yeah
[32:49] as Sons and Daughters
[32:52] you know sometimes we want to walk a
[32:56] little bit ahead of God
[32:58] no but he always pulls or ears
[33:02] right so here we see Samson
[33:07] and and then later on down to you know a
[33:10] couple of verses down down to 13. we
[33:13] noticed that he had a he he had a
[33:17] girlfriend
[33:21] that was not Israelite
[33:24] israelita he was she was a Philistine
[33:29] and her parents told Samson
[33:35] Samson out of so many girls from
[33:39] churches well you're looking out there
[33:42] foreign
[33:50] now he had a plan
[33:53] and God was working through that plan
[33:56] too you know that's what the Bible says
[34:01] and then we find out you know that
[34:04] things didn't work out as he planned it
[34:06] man
[34:12] killed some Philistines
[34:15] and when he went back
[34:18] the girl that he it was about to marry
[34:21] La muchacha que Seva con quesar it was
[34:24] already in somebody's else's man yes
[34:28] right and then I see
[34:32] that cow that was a downfall for Samsung
[34:39] and Samsung later on we notice and we
[34:44] can see
[34:45] that his weakness was women
[34:50] and when and I I want to talk to the
[34:54] guys right now
[34:57] and later on I want to talk to the
[34:59] ladies
[35:01] but every single one of you
[35:06] are called to the ministry
[35:09] you have to believe it
[35:12] you're called to sir
[35:20] so just keep that thought in your mind
[35:25] so here we're fine that
[35:29] Samsung had a purpose
[35:31] God had a purpose
[35:37] all right so we sometimes don't we don't
[35:40] realize what the purpose that God has
[35:42] for our lives
[35:46] but now here is Samson
[35:51] and why did I say that all of us are
[35:54] called to the ministry
[35:56] because brother Branham says on
[36:01] uh it says why are people so toasted
[36:04] about in the message preached in 1966.
[36:07] this element is
[36:12] it says uh um on the quote uh 15th this
[36:17] uh it says I notice in the scriptures
[36:21] that were it money was
[36:26] that were it money was the prophet
[36:29] Balaam who sold out his gift to goath on
[36:34] account of money when Balon offers so
[36:37] much money
[36:39] many of you are acquainted with the
[36:42] story what did Brother Brian was trying
[36:44] to say like basically that was what
[36:47] balum fell for for months okay
[36:52] and we always have heard of that right
[36:55] like there are the three things that men
[36:57] fall foreign
[37:57] I remember one day brother Bernie called
[38:00] a couple of the of of the youths
[38:05] and he told us
[38:07] I need you guys to get married
[38:13] so and this is what we're gonna do yes
[38:16] sir
[38:18] I want you guys to look upon all the
[38:22] girls from church
[38:27] and
[38:29] picked three ladies yes
[38:33] and then for a month
[38:35] you guys gonna be reading the message
[38:42] and while this time
[38:45] ernesta Tiempo you guys gonna be praying
[38:50] to guide you
[38:52] to choose one girl out of those three
[39:01] and it says because when brother Branham
[39:04] to preached that message they said
[39:07] the choosing of a bride
[39:10] he never mentioned pick one and then
[39:14] pray about it
[39:16] they had to be some or few then
[39:22] you know so he could actually pick one
[39:25] out of him
[39:27] and that's what I want you guys to do
[39:30] yes again
[39:33] for a month foreign
[40:13] and brother Bernie told me
[40:17] okay that's not the one I had in mind
[40:18] yes I know it's lucky it's like you
[40:21] already knew
[40:23] okay yeah okay so what I'm trying to
[40:28] tell you is how sometimes how we insert
[40:31] our own thoughts to God's thought
[40:35] one more time how we in search
[40:45] yes so
[40:48] things didn't work out
[40:51] we broke up she broke up with me
[40:57] that was my first girl ever
[41:00] Novia and that was so devastated to me
[41:03] and now at that time I was a youth
[41:05] president for Phoenix Arizona
[41:11] Phoenix at right at that point I didn't
[41:14] know what Depression was
[41:17] and for a year I fell on depression
[41:24] brother Bernie just kept me working and
[41:26] I told Brother Bernie I don't want to be
[41:28] the youth president anymore
[41:32] I'm not even helping the youth what do
[41:36] you keep me on that position is
[41:40] it like just hang in there you know just
[41:43] hang in there
[41:45] you know um like my dad used to say
[41:49] oh son you're just drowning on a glass
[41:51] of water
[41:54] you know and but at that time it didn't
[41:58] feel like it
[41:59] yeah
[42:02] but what I'm trying to tell you
[42:05] God has a plan for you
[42:07] that guy has the plan for you guys
[42:12] now now out of those gods that God call
[42:15] us
[42:19] I mean the guy those guys that go
[42:21] brother burning call you know on that
[42:22] time Los Muchachos
[42:30] and one of them is the brother brother I
[42:34] think is going to be here like in the
[42:36] next week like in the next like Sunday
[42:40] we used to call in Colombian
[42:44] the Colombia the Colombia
[42:48] you're telling his story
[42:52] but it was so devastating for me that
[42:56] definitely I I couldn't help the youth
[42:58] anymore
[43:01] I went straight
[43:05] I mean I stopped going to church
[43:10] I knew brother Bernie was
[43:12] and you know he was my pastor
[43:17] and then I started dating a a girl from
[43:20] from from the world
[43:25] things didn't work out uh that either
[43:29] God brought me back to church
[43:32] and not start helping brother Bernie
[43:34] more than I ever did
[43:38] right so and I thought that was on my uh
[43:43] that was really strong in the message
[43:56] but when my
[43:59] dad passed away Papa
[44:03] that was that was a blow that uh man
[44:06] knocked me out SFO um
[44:11] and I went to see brother burning
[44:15] one time
[44:18] I wanted to talk with him you know
[44:22] and when brother Bernie saw me
[44:26] he just told me to wait
[44:29] and then he says okay now you can come
[44:31] hello
[44:33] and when he the first words came out of
[44:36] his mouth was
[44:42] who exalts himself shall be humbled
[44:47] shall be exalted
[44:51] I won't speak to you the woman I'll I'm
[44:55] gonna call you later
[44:57] I was kind of like what's he talking
[44:58] about
[45:01] all right I'll wait
[45:06] baby
[45:10] seven years went by
[45:13] and he never called me
[45:16] but seven years later
[45:19] I was in the world
[45:21] doing drugs
[45:24] going places that I never thought that
[45:27] would have ever been yeah
[45:31] oh my I couldn't recognize myself
[45:36] the devil had blinded megado
[45:41] I thought that I was getting stronger
[45:43] foreign
[46:41] foreign
[47:15] instead
[47:45] so I look at at Samson
[47:49] being all defeated
[47:52] there with no eyes
[47:57] because he gave his heart
[48:01] before God and
[48:04] I understand now
[48:07] why brother Branham says
[48:10] that you gotta love God before your
[48:14] girlfriend
[48:24] my dad was my all to me
[48:28] but when he was in there
[48:30] I didn't know what to look up to you
[48:33] know
[48:36] see what I'm saying okay because God
[48:38] wasn't there guys was not the first
[48:42] thing on my life
[48:45] so I see Samsung they're all defeated
[48:52] youth Holiness one of the first things
[48:55] that you do when you stop coming to
[48:57] church
[49:03] you start looking for parties
[49:09] I already know all that about
[49:13] and I was just reading brother Brown
[49:19] he's saying that they threw a party and
[49:23] let's start saying okay
[49:24] Fiesta so they can make support out of
[49:28] Samson but I said on deported
[49:31] so here's Johnson son
[49:37] people making
[49:40] fun of Johnson
[49:41] they threw a party
[49:44] and I was just telling my brother
[49:47] oh bro oh Hermano
[49:52] now that I look back in my life
[49:55] to all these parties that I went
[50:03] to see me
[50:07] being defeated
[50:10] see what I'm saying I thought I was
[50:12] going to have fun
[50:15] but I was the one that would make a
[50:17] mockery of peruse me
[50:21] you don't see it like that
[50:24] that's how I see now that uh
[50:27] I went through all that so
[50:31] the devil is making fun of you every
[50:35] time you go to a party
[50:37] to see a Son of God defeated
[50:45] that is that's what it's all about
[50:49] around
[51:06] but see that so I was there and don't
[51:08] say what I saw
[51:11] and when I was in that condition
[51:16] I'll start thinking back your comments
[51:19] are
[51:20] what brother Bernie told me
[51:25] and I started looking at my life
[51:29] and I I was kind of like what Paul said
[51:32] on the on the Epistles
[51:37] I can brag about myself
[51:41] I was born I was the Son of a Preacher
[51:47] I was the son of a pastor
[51:50] I was under one of the best uh teachers
[51:55] that's ever been over
[52:00] in our time which is brother Bernie
[52:04] I was there under his shadows
[52:08] and look at the condition that
[52:11] is
[52:13] what I'm saying to you
[52:15] do not extend of falling
[52:22] under the cloth of the devil amigo
[52:28] so you think you're strong
[52:31] God cannot use
[52:41] do you recognize
[52:46] God is not with you
[52:49] nothing nothing
[52:54] yes
[52:56] I understand
[52:57] you don't have to pass through a world
[52:59] we did it
[53:03] you don't have to listen to your parents
[53:07] or listen to me at least me
[53:12] so being in that condition
[53:15] I start thinking what broth Bernie said
[53:18] about me well he told me that day
[53:22] and he was right
[53:25] every single word he was right
[53:33] and then I'll start thinking why he
[53:35] never called me
[53:38] and then the Holy Spirit told me that's
[53:41] what my said let's speak to Santo was it
[53:43] brother Bernie
[53:45] what was the Holy Spirit to through
[53:47] brother Bernie
[53:52] and I understood
[53:54] Anton says that it was the Holy Spirit
[54:00] and I understood also
[54:04] but now it's time
[54:06] to go back that he was the one calling
[54:10] me back
[54:13] [Music]
[54:20] oh my God I worked five straight years
[54:23] of my life for brother Bernie that's not
[54:26] the way he pays me back
[54:29] so God told me
[54:32] you did that for the man
[54:37] and I said I'm sorry Lord
[54:41] as for that
[54:46] so Anton says
[54:49] I remember
[54:55] one more step there's no return
[55:01] so I decided and I just quit my friends
[55:04] everything is so
[55:15] that I couldn't face my pastor okay
[55:18] pastor I said no it's not the time yet
[55:24] I feel so ashamed of things
[55:29] I'm pretty sure you already knows all
[55:31] about it
[55:33] so I see Samson in this condition
[55:37] that's why when he said Lord wants more
[55:40] time
[55:43] that was me on that condition
[55:48] so
[55:50] I remember
[55:51] um that we went to a youth camp Anthony
[55:55] God touched me there
[55:57] we've been back to Phoenix and
[56:03] um I got baptized
[56:05] even though I knew that already been
[56:09] baptized before okay
[56:13] but I was doing late night now uh now
[56:16] and I knew what I was doing
[56:19] okay I was really repented of the things
[56:22] that I had done foreign
[56:40] and I did Eloise and
[56:44] um I remember that day
[56:48] um uh just knock at the door
[56:52] and I said I would like to see brother
[56:54] burning
[56:56] see uh it was different this time
[57:00] because I used to leave a brother
[57:02] Bernie's house
[57:04] I could go in and out at will yo is
[57:10] you know but uh at this time it was
[57:12] different
[57:13] I was asking for permission
[57:18] and he said yeah everyone said it's okay
[57:20] you know you can come in yeah
[57:25] and before I would ever say something
[57:29] he was so happy
[57:32] I heard that you got baptized
[57:37] this is
[57:42] and he says in the name of the Lord
[57:43] Jesus Christ
[57:50] oh my God he was so happy
[57:53] and I could see the uh uh
[57:57] I could picture the prodigal son you
[57:59] know going back to his house
[58:09] Dad I remember that a brother a brother
[58:13] that um used to um help him you know
[58:16] used to help brother burning
[58:21] it got there uh kind of like at the same
[58:24] time that I did yeah
[58:26] and brother was so happy that he says
[58:28] like do you know him
[58:32] he said did you know that he just got
[58:34] baptized
[58:38] so that's how happy a pastor gets yes
