good to be in the house of God tonight amen amen if you can open up your Bibles with me to the Book of Matthew chapter 3 and verse 16 amen go ahead and read it it reads like this it says when he had been baptized Jesus came up immediately from the the water and behold the heavens were open to him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and the lighting upon Him amen goe and jump to chapter 4 and then just read the first verse here reads like this it says then Jesus was led up by the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted by the devil we can bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord Jesus in this night God we ask ask that you just be with us father and that you just come and speak words of eternal life to us Lord come Lord Jesus and have your way with us tonight and may you prepare our hearts to receive your word tonight Lord Jesus Lord we just ask you be with us God and that your will be done in this service in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you can have your seats amen we're going to be talking about Jesus and more specifically about um him overcoming in the desert [Music] amen and as a title along with my brothers we placed Overcoming By the word amen uh we just read read here in Matthew chapter 3 that is spoke of how Jesus was baptized amen and I think for anybody it's a turning point in your life to get baptized I I think it was a turning point in Jesus's life because that's where he received the Holy Spirit and I think that was a moment of victory for him amen is when he was baptized by the Lord and he was able to feel God's presence amen and I think that it it made it so much easier um that he was able to feel God's presence but not only that but that he was surrounded by his brothers amen he was in the presence of other people amen now I find it interesting how God baptizes Jesus or has Jesus to be baptized and then right after God God himself leads Jesus to be tempted amen and I believe to truly overcome uh you overcome alone uh you you don't truly overcome when you're with your brothers and your sisters it's a lot easier to overcome and fight with you guys Brothers it's a lot easier to overcome with you guys but I know that when I leave tonight it's going to be up to me alone amen um even though I have my dad at home I won't be able to overcome based on his experiences amen I have to live the life myself amen amen amen so God leads Jesus out into the Wilderness amen so we can see that Jesus also knew what it felt to be alone amen and I want to read here in John chapter 16 verse 32 and it says like this it says behold the hour cometh yah is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet I am not alone because the father is with me amen this really spoke to me because a lot of times I feel alone but I I like that the Lord Jesus was able to realize that he says ye shall leave me alone and yet I am not alone because the father is with me amen amen so often times though we feel alone and we feel that we're fighting alone because maybe dad isn't there because maybe your mom isn't there or you don't have that support group but I want to let you know that although you might feel alone you are not alone because the father is with you amen amen and I really find it interesting how the one of the first things Jesus was taught in the beginning of his ministry which is right here in chapter 4 where he read is that you have to fight alone amen and I think that's really important for us to realize is that God will fight alongside us and God will fight for us at times but he won't do all the fighting for us we have to pull our own we we have to get up every morning and live the life ourselves amen and I think that one thing that's also important to clear up is that Jesus started alone and he ended alone amen and it'll be no different for us amen we have to start we have to make the decision to choose Christ and at the end of the day to it's going to be us alone again choosing Christ amen amen so we're talking about Overcomers now we know that in order to be an overcomer there must be something to overcome amen and I want to read this quote uh from brother brandham it's in the the message the marriage of the Lamb and it's preached in 62 and it says like this it says if you notice it said she had made herself ready so many says so many says if the Lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from Ling or from lying or stealing I'll serve him amen but that's up to you you got to do something too and then he says they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down amen we have to make that decision in our lives Brothers I don't know how for how long I've waited uh coming to church waiting for the preacher to say something to change my life and I I have heard a lot of great messages amen but I'll keep waiting for that right moment I'll keep waiting for the preacher to say the right thing amen and I'll stay sitting down in my seat waiting for that moment because that moment will never come amen there's not a right moment there's only now amen it's only right now to make the decision wa waiting for the right moment is like waiting for the past to come back and and and and redo itself or undo itself amen there's there's no point in it amen amen now I kind of want to get into how we overcome in Revelations 1211 inaly it says like this it says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony amen so how did we overcome because we have to believe that we've already overcome amen there's no better way to win amen than when you already know you won I feel like that's the best way to win amen maybe it's cheating but if I know the table is rigged and if it's in my favor I'm going all out amen because I know at the end of the day what's goingon to happen so I think that you ought to live the same way when your head is lifted from the pillow every morning and when it lay and when it lays down at night am you ought to know that the table is a Rigg you ought to know that whatever happens from the time you get up to the time you lay down it's all under the blood it's all under the blood the only person who remembers that is you and the devil amen amen God doesn't see it amen and something that that just came to my mind right now was was a har family um they got me a Bible for my birthday man God bless him for that and on it it has it has a it has a cross on it and on the cross it has a a paper that says record of debt amen amen and has my name on it amen and it it just seems so tremendous how um I I didn't even have to do anything it's all it's all already done amen amen all I have to do is live the life the blueprint has already been set for us all we have to do is live according to the way that the Lord's showing us amen amen but uh as The Story Goes uh Jesus is Led Out Into the Wilderness he's leted out alone amen and us talking with my dad a little bit uh we kind of we kind of talked about how uh how the attitude that you take towards the Wilderness it'll show your true colors amen amen and for me personally well I take it like this I say I say to myself I say well well it's really easy in church to to be in a Revival amen it's really easy it's really easy to be in a good mood too but what about when we leave amen what then it gets a lot harder then amen when it's just you alone but more often than not the attitude that you take towards the trials that you endure amen will determine the altitude amen and the altitude will determine whether or not you can just fly right over amen the trials won't affect you if you're attitude is [Music] Right amen amen amen one thing I like that uh a preacher named TD Jake said as he says this he says this about the desert the Wilderness and that's where Jesus was he says this it is a desert that separates the Saints from the ANS amen and I really like that because our trials although we may not like to endure them it does a lot for us it really does it shows us if our experience we had the past Sunday was really genuine amen not to say it wasn't but I would prefer to not shed a single tear to never feel so anything to never feel the presence of God but for God to truly change me on the inside for God to change my mind to change my attitude to change my habits anything I would prefer that over anything amen amen what else does your trials do for you it shows you how close you are to God Amen imagine 40 days and 40 nights a lot could have happened to the Lord he could have walked away from the Lord from the father amen amen and and when we're not here when we're alone it shows us how truly how close we are to God Amen where we invest our time amen what attracts us behind closed doors amen amen and and the the last thing is that it brings you closer to him it brings you closer to God Amen if you allow it because even if you fail Brothers you come back where you failed and and you know what to do better you know what not to do amen amen amen I'm going to be closing now and I'm going to go ahead and read uh verse 33 of uh of John 16 and it says like this it says these things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world Amen aren't you happy that's the god that you serve knows what it's like amen I don't like it I don't like it when somebody tries to tell me something but they've never lived it amen I say well how would you know what would you know Brothers God knows God knows amen God bless you [Applause] God bless you Brothers if we can change uh turn our Bibles to Matthew chapter 4:3 and 4 and The Temper came to him and he said if thou be the Son of God command that those stones be made bread but he answered and he said it is written and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that's proceeded out of the mouth of God when Jesus was in in the wilderness he was there for 40 days and 40 nights he had just received the the Holy Spirit oh he and he probably was having the best time of his life I am alone no one's going to bother me I am having a good time up here but his first temptation oh one of one of the the first assaults how brother brandham says one of the first assaults happened when he came down and the and Satan told him turn these stones into bread he was hungry at that time and Satan hit him in his weakest point he could have performed that Miracle right there but he said it is written and I see he could have used his powers he could have used that and turn those stones into bread see and there was two more times after that when Satan tempted him the other time was when he was in the temple and then when he took him to the mountain and he showed him all the kingdoms and he said this cannot be yours but he said I will these he said Satan told him if you worship me this cannot be yours but Jesus told them again it is written and the only one that should be worshiped is the Lord see last night I I I was thinking and and I was thinking what if Jesus really turned those stones into bread see he would have ate them and he would have been full but see that he would have be hungry again in a few hours that would have just been an instant [Music] gratification see because he would have been hungry again in a few hours see sometimes we want to fill ourselves with instant gratifications we just want the easy routes see Satan comes and tempts us and he offers us something and that's what happens sometimes when we're alone like brother was saying you know he finds us alone he says I'm going to give you this I'm would you take sometimes he just wants to give us sex he wants to give us drugs he wants to give us money he wants to give us Fame he wants to give us L he wants to give us he wants to give us luxury he wants to give us pornography he wants to give us music he wants to give us Sports he wants to give you something that satisfies your flesh he wants to give us makeup he wants you to feel better for the moment he wants you to feel good at the moment see all those things are just like sugar see sugar only energizes just just for a little bit it gives you energy for a few minutes and it goes away that's how sin is see the things of the world they just fill us up temporarily it doesn't give us a full satisfaction it just fills you up for just a moment it just gives you a quick feeling in your flesh but let me tell you this come on youth don't let the devil fool you it's only going to make you feel good for a little bit see we're all tempted some way or some way or we all sin none of us here don't sin we sin every day I know there's someone here tonight that's Satan that we have to tell Satan you know what Satan I don't care how much you T me you're not going to overcome me I was made to be an overcomer I'm not going to let nothing beat me come on youth if there's someone that can say I'm not going to let you take me you're not going to beat me no sir if there is a youth that would say here tonight it is written that promise is mine it is written in the word of God and there is no one that's going to take it from me I don't care what the world says I don't care what the people say I don't care what my coworkers say or what my classmates say I'm not going to gain the World Mark 8:36 says maros what's the whole point the whole gaining the whole world if you're just going to lose your soul what's the point of gaining all that you can gain all that you can gain all the riches you want but we're just going to lose it all it doesn't matter how much the devil tempts you if there is someone here that would say it is written just like Jesus said at that he said no sir it is written is there someone that would say tonight I'm not going to let these worldly things get between me that will get between me and my relationship with God youth Hess it is time that you discover that the only thing you need here on Earth it is God nothing else are you willing to leave everything behind all those things that have tempted you in the past all those things that filled you up temporarily all those things that gave you an inst gratification it's not too late to turn your life around don't worry about the mistakes you done don't let it disturb your future leave it all in God's hands all these Earthly things they're all just a waste of time they not going to give you anything it is time to turn to him and you will find peace he will give you your full gratification he will fill you completely and nothing can take that from you see because the most beautiful things here on Earth they cannot be seen they cannot be touched you can't even smell them they come from your heart it is a seed that's in your heart it is something that's in your heart that is calling you something that was born in your heart something that was placed in your heart Isaiah 40:31 says and I'm not going to read the whole verse says wait upon the Lord he will renew your strength when you feel weak when you feel like you can't do it no more I know this life is hard I've been tempted so many times and a lot of times I have fallen but that doesn't help me I don't give up I get back up and I keep fighting come on you don't give up you got to keep fighting for your salvation you got to keep fighting for what God has given you if you can't overcome something right now just wait upon the Lord he will give you the strength that you need he will give you the energy you need he's not going to give you something temporary he's going to give you something that's full of Eternity I'm going to read this this this uh verse this uh quote from the message how can I overcome though Jesus was tempted he overcame he overcame for us he endured all things for me and for you see he could have took it right then but what he did to take the other route for so that we could be with him if he pay such a price how little would it be not to take it when we remember there is nothing here anyhow if you live 100 years what are you going to come to mental your mind gone all crippled up all Shake all old and shaky that's where you're going that's the end of it you come now and overcome the thing how do you do it by the word that God says you do it walk humbly live before Jesus he endured all those things for you and I he is our example on how to overcome our evil generation he as he as he overcome his evil generation he gave us everything so we can overcome it may seem easy but it is hard I know it's hard is Matthew 2435 says it says Heaven and Earth will pass but my words shall not pass away the word of God youth will not pass it will not perish he is giving you the greatest weapon to fight Temptation and that's the word don't let this be weak body beat you I know it's going to be hard but your soul is worth more what are you going to do are are you going to let this weak body beat you or you going to let the soul that wants to fight fight for your eternal life if there's someone that would say here tonight that would say I don't care what the devil says it is written and I am I'm going to stand for God God bless [Applause] you God bless you brothers so on Fridays now we're preaching on Jesus and the beginning of his ministry and today we're focusing on Matthew chapter 4 and this chapter is the chapter where Jesus went to the Wilderness and he fasted 40 days and 40 nights and he was tempted by the devil now in one of the in one of The Temptations which was the third Temptation he had the devil took him up to a high mountain and he showed him all the nations and he said I can give you all this if if only you Bow Down and Worship me but Jesus said get thee hence Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou worship now Brothers the devil came to Jesus with the word and Jesus also came with the word but what was the difference the difference was that Jesus that de the devil came with the word but he came with the wrong intentions he came to tempt Jesus but Jesus he came with the word and the right attitude he came with the word and the right Spirit he came filled with the Holy Ghost and with the right spirit in the word he was able to defeat Jesus and Jesus he was our example that the word of God and the right Spirit can defeat the Devil any day anywhere at any time and that was the main difference it was the attitude of Jesus he came full of the spirit and he fasted 40 days and 40 nights and now the number 40 is the number of Temptation and I believe at this time Jesus was hungry and this is the time the devil knew that he would be at his weakest point but Jesus was ready because he knew the scriptures and he was full of the Holy Spirit now I would like to read Hebrews chapter 2 verse 18 for in that he himself has suffered being tempted he is able to secort them that are tempted you see Jesus had to be tempted in order to know what we go through you know brother brandham says he had to be tempted in every single thing in order to overcome so he can show us how we can overcome because Jesus is our greatest example that we have without Jesus we would be lost we would be lost in our own Pleasures because we were constantly fall into sin and Temptation so he had to be tempted Brothers in every single way imaginable so he could understand Us in order to help us you know brother brandham says that when he was up there in the mountain that the way Jesus was able to overcome was with the word in the right spirit and many times Brothers we have the word it's at our disposal we study and we read but many times we don't have the right attitude we don't have the right spirit why we're not prepared sometimes when on Fridays instead of preparing to come to service we're at home laying back chilling watching a movie maybe watching some Instagram reals but that's not right Brothers especially if you're down because it's easy to overcome in the high places when you're but when you're down in the valley that's when the trial begins that's where the devil likes to come at us you know brother Bram says when one receives the Holy Ghost that's when the Devil comes to try and tempt us because he knows he can he he tries his best to convince us that we did not receive anything that's when he tempts us to try to make us fall to make us think that we did not receive the Holy Ghost but Brothers we have to prepare we have to prepare ourselves not just for service but for his coming because if we don't prepare we're going to stay behind brothers and that's what the devil's trying to do and that's why he tempts us so hard especially in this day and age you know in this day and age you know all these social media platforms they have they have launched a war against us for things for our attention and for our time because many times we waste the time of God we waste the time of God on other things instead of what we should be doing which is reading his word and preparing ourselves now many times we're in a fallen condition and like our brother Titus said on Wednesday we have little strength but like he said when we have little strength that's the best time to go back to his word that's when we should go to his word because that's where our strength is you know God had to show the Church of Philadelphia that by their works and by their strength they were nothing they could not do it they had to hold on to his word they had to hold on to his strength because that's the only way we're going to make it Brothers like brother Titus said sometimes we're too strong and because we're too strong we think we could do it on our own and that's why many of the times God lets us be tempted God lets us be beat down because he's seeking someone weak so that weak person can come to him and fully submit himself in order to say it was by your strength Lord not by mine and you know we can receive the Holy Ghost and God can be with us and God can dwell in us and he can help us with temptation but at the end of the day it's up to us whether or not to fall whether or not to fall into that Temptation it's up to us Brothers it's up to our decision we have to make a decision am I going to go to God am I going to hold on to his word or am I going to rely on something else am I going to r on Instagram St maybe I rely on my job maybe I I rely on something else on myself on making money all that brothers that that's all right but it shouldn't be our main source of strength it should be the word of God and brothers many times whether or not to take his word the devil's word or to take the word of God you know we need to be filled so much with the word of God and with the right spirit that we overcome the Temptation the devil throws at us because before Jesus went into the Wilderness to be tempted he was baptized and it says he was filled with the Holy Spirit and we should be the same way we need to be filled brothers or else we're not going to make it we need to be so filled that we're just like Jesus who said devil get away from me for it is written it is written and brothers he is he he is our example brothers and it is written it's written brothers that we're going to make it you know sometimes we're at lows and we have little strength and many times we fall but it's okay just get back again don't give up learn from your mistakes don't stay down for it says in Proverbs 24:16 for the just man falls seven times but he gets up again and I believe that if you're a Christian if you fall seven times the Lord will lift you up eight for it's not about our strength but it's by his that's why we need the right Spirit to submit ourselves fully to God to God and His word because it's like my brother Edward said one time we can come to church in his name but not in the right spirit and brothers that's the truth because if we don't have the right Spirit we're just like the Pharisees you know the the musicians come forward and I would just like to read this quote by brother brandham in Bal and Gilead preached in 59 now with our heads bowed I would like to ask this Solon question how many people present would like to come to that Fountain would want God to put his spirit so richly in you like was in Jesus so that you could resist temptation that you've tasted something so much better than tobacco something so much better Pleasures than drinking will give so much better pleasures of going to church than it would be to go to a card party you'd like to have that you'd love to have it so you could be free from sin not because you are not tempted but in every Temptation he will make a way of Escape you know God is so faithful he'll always make a way of escape the Bible says that he will not allow us to be tempted more than we can bear and that he can he will always have a way of escape and what is his way of Escape holding on to his word holding on to the Holy Spirit letting him take control being so filled of the word of God in his Spirit to say devil it is written my Lord is with me and if he is for me who can be against me Lord help us tonight be able to say devil get off of me stay away from me because I'm so full of his word and of his spirit that you can't stop me you can't stop me from coming to my Lord submitting myself so much that I am fully in his will I am fully in his will and I am doing what he is asking me to do and I'm not falling to Temptation because I am so full of him because he overcame and because it's not me for it's Christ in me who is now overcoming that Temptation so youth if you are being tempted tonight just come to Christ come and be full of his word and of his Spirit maybe you have fallen but that's all right God is still with you he will lift you up you just need to go to him come to him fully submit to him filled of His Holy Spirit and he will help you the altar is open tonight come and be free of whatever the Temptation the Devil comes at you with that's all I have tonight Brothers God bless [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] you look [Music] at look at go [Music] to [Music] H this [Applause] for the to [Music] frag this

knows how to speak to our hearts amen God bless our brothers God continue using them these youth may God be with them I was meditating I have never meditated this on this before sometimes we think it was 40 days and 40 nights of Temptation Felix like our brother Felix said he may have been okay for 40 days and 40 nights he had just come from a Revival that's how we find ourselves many times when God descends he anoints us and we feel his presence and for a time we're okay days for 40 days and 40 nights all right he wasn't tempted until after the 40 days and 40 nights sometimes we're still Sur we're still surviving from the anointing we're still maintaining from that great Revival that we had but it when it begins to fade out sooner or later there will be there will be a decline there will be a come a time of Temptation it was until after those 40 days and 40 when the Temptation came when Satan came the devil knows how to wait wait for that emotion to go [Music] by wait for that Revival to go to just calm down and then come to tempt us in our most weakest of times and how beautiful God spoke to us we need the right Spirit not only the word but we need the right Spirit we forget before Jesus could overcome he had to be filled with the spirit that's what we need be filled with the spirit may God help us in seeking that we be reading the announcements we all the watch through
