[22:45] trust nothing in the ways of
[22:48] God and one can wait on
[22:52] God God works in his
[22:55] perfect how many believe that
[22:59] how many bring their
[23:02] Bible remember this is the
[23:06] sword to the church we should bring our
[23:10] Bible many people bring their iphon
[23:14] their
[23:15] phones many people bring a lot of stuff
[23:18] but they don't bring their
[23:19] Bible if you don't bring your
[23:22] Bible you came to the wrong
[23:25] place because we came here to
[23:28] the word of
[23:30] God and we're all here to
[23:33] learn how are we going to learn if we
[23:34] have
[23:36] the we can say many words
[23:38] here but you need
[23:41] to
[23:42] what is a word of
[23:46] God if you may please stand we'll go to
[23:49] the book of
[23:51] Acts my name is
[23:54] Oscar I am Mexican
[23:58] I'm not salad I'm
[24:06] Mexican book of Acts chapter
[24:12] two and verse
[24:17] one when you're ready you may say amen
[24:24] amen is the word of God is written in
[24:26] these pages
[24:30] p and when
[24:32] the when the day of Pentecost was fully
[24:34] come they were all with one Accord in
[24:36] one
[24:38] place in that same
[24:41] book in chapter
[24:44] one verse four it says like this
[24:58] me and being assembled together with
[25:00] them commanded them that they should not
[25:02] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[25:04] promise of the Father which saith he ye
[25:06] have heard of
[25:08] me let us
[25:11] pray Our Father who are in
[25:15] heaven I come before your presence
[25:19] tonight recognizing
[25:22] Lord that you are The Sovereign
[25:25] God and that in
[25:27] you there is there's no
[25:30] coincidences your
[25:32] word is
[25:34] infallible and your
[25:37] purposes must be
[25:40] done Lord I ask for my brothers
[25:43] tonight may
[25:45] you touch every
[25:47] heart may you an my
[25:50] lips May Oscar
[25:53] depart so that you can take this
[25:56] place and speak through my lips
[25:59] and may it be a blessing to your
[26:03] people because I ask this in your in the
[26:05] precious name of
[26:07] Lord our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[26:12] amen you may be seated
[26:21] Brothers one of the points that stand
[26:23] out to me reading this book was
[26:32] the key word
[26:40] was they said do not depart wait on the
[26:46] promise today's thought is on
[26:49] waiting wait to
[26:51] wait to
[26:54] wait we're living in some
[26:56] times where people don't know how to
[27:00] wait people
[27:02] outside and people in here as
[27:04] well we don't know how to
[27:09] wait you see the life of the human
[27:12] being the life of human
[27:14] being is running and
[27:18] running join
[27:23] fastly and if your secular or natural
[27:26] life is to run and to run
[27:29] and not to
[27:30] wait let me tell you you will
[27:34] fail you will
[27:37] fail because all Son of
[27:40] God the word says is Guided by the
[27:43] spirit of
[27:45] God and when you're Guided by the spirit
[27:47] of
[27:48] God you will know to wait on
[27:52] him
[27:54] God never fails or never makes a mistake
[27:59] God has made everything
[28:01] perfect at his
[28:05] time first he created man and then the
[28:11] heavens he did not create man and then
[28:15] Stars it was all an
[28:19] order because if he created man first
[28:21] where would he put
[28:24] him if he created man first where would
[28:27] that man from
[28:30] so we recognize God is a god of
[28:32] order in these times we are
[28:36] seeing there's a desperation in the
[28:39] humankind and that
[28:42] desperation has not been good to the
[28:45] humankind we have a pregnant
[28:50] woman and her nine months of
[28:54] pregnancy but when she has six seven
[28:56] months
[28:58] she wants to see that
[29:01] baby when the young man is 14 years
[29:06] old many of
[29:12] you when one is Young and has 14 years
[29:14] of
[29:16] age we wanted to be 20
[29:20] already and when you got to
[29:22] 20 he wanted to be
[29:25] 30 because you saw everyone else
[29:28] how
[29:30] they how much Freedom they had to do
[29:32] what they wanted
[29:34] to and now that we have
[29:37] 40 or
[29:39] 50 we want to have we want to be
[29:43] 10 because we see our
[29:46] children and how much we say I want to
[29:50] you
[29:53] work you don't work and you're not
[29:56] worried about anything you have
[29:57] everything
[29:59] you have to
[30:01] eat and what he asked for it is given to
[30:04] him I want to tell you tonight
[30:09] youth that you're in the right
[30:12] time
[30:13] not not more or less the time of god is
[30:23] perfect there's a
[30:26] desperation place it in the hands of
[30:29] God God has the best for
[30:34] you I tell you this by
[30:40] experience because I was from a family
[30:42] that I was
[30:44] adopted I want to say this
[30:47] quickly because I believe it's going to
[30:49] be a help to
[30:50] you knowing that every single one of
[30:53] you has their
[30:56] testimony some got brought them out of
[31:00] alcoholism others out of
[31:02] drugs and others out of the
[31:06] worst but if God call us out of there
[31:08] it's for
[31:11] something these people went to go away
[31:13] for the Holy
[31:15] Spirit and when they received the Holy
[31:19] Spirit the Lord Jesus said you will be a
[31:21] witness today witness of what of his
[31:26] power of His glory
[31:29] because many were
[31:34] saved so every single one of us has a
[31:38] purpose I want to focus on youth because
[31:41] there's who
[31:44] next because those of us who have 40 50
[31:47] 60 years of
[31:48] age brother B would say
[31:51] this I have 45 years of age and I
[31:54] already feel
[31:55] old what how is it to those who are
[32:00] 50 or those 55 or
[32:05] 60 pastor at the
[32:08] park that there was a sadness in my
[32:14] heart because God called me since the
[32:16] age of
[32:18] eight and I always avoided
[32:21] God and he kept on calling me from 14 to
[32:24] 15 years and I avoided him
[32:28] and time passed
[32:31] on until he had to do something to call
[32:34] me
[32:37] out and when I recognized it was the
[32:39] calling of
[32:40] God I had to do what he was telling me
[32:42] to
[32:45] do when the re to my life and I knew it
[32:48] was
[32:50] God my life was filled of
[32:53] sadness
[32:55] why because now I want to do
[32:58] do the will of God many
[33:01] things but there's no more
[33:06] strengths the strength are waning
[33:10] out I can't see as
[33:13] well
[33:16] sad we have such a great God and full of
[33:20] love that he does not condemn you for
[33:23] that he's a god of opportunity
[33:29] and I believe every single one of us has
[33:30] an opport opportunity from
[33:33] God what will we do with that
[33:39] opportunity God took me to a
[33:41] family so they would raise
[33:44] me to to guard to protect
[33:49] me they instruct me in the ways of the
[33:51] Lord under the denomination
[33:55] M my mom was a Pres
[33:58] Arian my sisters were
[34:01] Baptists and had a Pentecostal
[34:04] brother it was a
[34:12] salad and it comes to a moment where you
[34:14] have to make the
[34:16] decision I was baptized in every single
[34:18] one of those
[34:21] churches I have like six or seven
[34:24] baptisms so if it's about
[34:26] baptism already
[34:33] there it's about the Revelation on the
[34:35] part of
[34:40] God when I was 40 years of age about
[34:43] that the Lord brought me to the message
[34:47] I'm I'm not for so long in the message
[34:49] but I believe it with all my heart that
[34:51] it's the truth of
[34:55] God and the Youth of this place
[35:00] should be thankful with
[35:03] God it's a supernatural
[35:06] way because they're in the right
[35:09] place they're with the right
[35:13] message look many people fail
[35:17] outside because they don't have any
[35:20] advice they need advice or
[35:24] counseling but the counseling depends on
[35:26] who is from
[35:31] amen but even then people outside fail
[35:33] because there's no
[35:36] counseling but the people of
[35:38] God when they have a
[35:41] good that's
[35:43] unexplainable that's
[35:46] unexplainable the people of
[35:49] God as they walk with
[35:51] him everything was good there were
[35:55] blessings no one would get sick
[36:00] everything was going
[36:02] well but when they
[36:07] deviated when they did not want to take
[36:09] the counseling of their
[36:12] Prophet when they no longer want to
[36:14] listen to the coun of their
[36:16] Pastor that's when it went
[36:20] wrong they paid the consequences of
[36:23] their
[36:24] decisions and brother Bram says this
[36:30] every person will pay their consequence
[36:31] of their
[36:34] decisions we
[36:36] have to
[36:38] learn to wait on
[36:44] God Patiently I Waited on the Lord said
[36:47] David
[36:51] patiently we are not
[36:54] patient every single one of us has a
[36:56] burden
[37:00] here have a struggle or a fight or a
[37:04] battle some may be
[37:07] financially others may be a
[37:10] sickness others are struggling because
[37:12] they want a boyfriend or
[37:14] girl others because they want a
[37:17] girlfriend but we're all
[37:20] struggling in this walk it's a
[37:24] struggle it's a battle
[37:30] and if you don't grab on to God and wait
[37:31] on
[37:32] God we're going to struggle even
[37:36] more I want to tell you this
[37:38] story for the
[37:41] Youth because the adults we're
[37:43] already we don't apply to
[37:48] this I knew an
[37:53] evangelist who ministered to some
[37:56] Youth and this that this camper
[38:00] campaign this was his
[38:07] theme ask do not choose or do not
[38:10] grab he preached this to the
[38:13] youth ask do not
[38:17] choose and he gave his
[38:20] testimony on how God gave him his wife I
[38:24] want to tell this to the
[38:25] youth because if you're praying
[38:29] a deep call it the
[38:32] deep and this young man started to pray
[38:35] for his
[38:38] partner and he asked
[38:44] God God is a specific
[38:47] God and whatever you ask him that's what
[38:49] he'll give
[38:52] you and this young man started to ask
[38:54] God God I want a young lady
[38:57] that is thin long
[39:01] hair clear or light light colored
[39:06] eyes but above
[39:09] all that loves
[39:12] you and that was his
[39:16] prayer until one occasion God talked to
[39:19] him through a
[39:22] vision and told him
[39:26] tomorrow at 9 in the
[39:28] morning you go to this certain
[39:31] place to this
[39:35] Supermarket the
[39:38] market there's a
[39:40] section where they sell
[39:47] food and he told me you go to the aisle
[39:50] four you go to the
[39:54] left and at the last Shelf
[39:58] at the right
[40:01] hand there will be a a
[40:04] cafe you'll go
[40:06] there and you ask for a
[40:10] coffee a young lady will attend to
[40:13] you when she gives you this
[40:16] coffee and you grab that
[40:19] coffee she will not let you pay for
[40:23] it that is her
[40:29] the brother said he woke up at 5 in the
[40:31] morning he took a
[40:34] shower and he dressed and he did his
[40:37] hair as best he
[40:39] could and at 7 in the
[40:41] morning he was at the
[40:46] supermarket to church he was late but he
[40:48] went to the supermarket
[40:53] early he said that when he walked on the
[40:55] aisle like God had told him
[40:59] he went he went to the
[41:03] right and he went to the
[41:07] cafe and there was this young
[41:10] lady and the young lady was worshiping
[41:13] God she had her
[41:15] praise and he greeted her and he
[41:22] said what she said what would you
[41:25] like and he told her I like a
[41:29] coffee with my my
[41:31] pleasure she served him the
[41:33] coffee they
[41:36] talked and when he finished that
[41:39] coffee he he told her how much will it
[41:44] be she said
[41:46] nothing he said how come it's
[41:51] nothing she said nothing because the
[41:53] Lord told me you would come here
[41:55] today how is was
[41:59] that I have been praying for my
[42:02] partner and the Lord told me he'd be
[42:06] here and he told me he'd ask Mee but not
[42:10] to charge
[42:11] him that is your
[42:15] partner now we believe if that's the
[42:17] word of God or
[42:18] not because brother
[42:22] BR
[42:25] St when he went to go
[42:27] for a brother and he was
[42:30] guided the Bible says we're all the
[42:34] children of
[42:35] God by the spirit of
[42:38] God I want to say you
[42:41] tonight keep on
[42:43] praying keep on
[42:45] waiting patiently
[42:51] wait God has something better for you
[42:54] than you
[42:55] canose you can make a mistake
[42:59] make a mistake but God could
[43:02] never God bless it was a
[43:04] [Applause]
[43:16] pleasure bless
[43:18] you man I'm going to go ahead and uh
[43:21] read that verse once
[43:24] again Acts chapter 2 verse one
[43:31] says like
[43:33] this says and when the day of Pentecost
[43:35] was fully come they were all with one
[43:38] Accord in one
[43:43] place amen may God have the blessing to
[43:46] the reading of his
[43:48] word amen
[43:51] Pentecost P I think Pentecost is a
[43:55] process
[43:58] hard
[44:00] one amen um when they told us we were
[44:02] going to preach on
[44:06] Pentecost I didn't know really know what
[44:08] to
[44:11] say I've got a little taste of
[44:17] Pentecost um so I I didn't know what I
[44:19] could share you
[44:21] know that's why I stayed on verse one
[44:23] and didn't go past that
[44:28] amen but I just kind of started
[44:31] thinking if you allow me to dramatize a
[44:33] little
[44:36] bit how this group of
[44:39] people um they're all gathered together
[44:41] in one
[44:44] place I mean you can probably imagine
[44:47] they're pretty Maybe dirty
[44:54] beaten left everything
[44:57] they don't have nothing to turn back
[45:00] to now their leader is
[45:04] gone maybe they turned to one another
[45:06] and they're
[45:09] like
[45:11] hey hey and he's
[45:15] like you think it's worth
[45:19] it you got any
[45:23] regrets and maybe that guy or that
[45:25] sister whoever it might have been
[45:29] they started going back to all the
[45:31] adventures they might have
[45:36] had with
[45:38] Jesus all the things that they went
[45:40] through with
[45:42] him then he gives them the
[45:46] answer says no
[45:49] no amen amen that's kind of how I
[45:54] feel you sit here and you try to live a
[45:57] Christian
[46:00] Life trying to push and get to your
[46:02] experience
[46:06] amen that turning point in your
[46:11] life and you start thinking about
[46:16] quitting you start thinking it's too
[46:19] much amen because I think that we as
[46:21] Christian we struggle more than the
[46:23] people in the world
[46:27] we have our everyday problems along with
[46:29] the ones that the
[46:34] spiritual amen and I think that that's
[46:36] just a part of life you know life has
[46:42] Seasons amen our life is constantly
[46:47] changing we're put in different
[46:49] conditions all the
[46:51] time man I think there's one thing that
[46:53] we can count on though
[46:57] and that's that God doesn't change
[47:00] amen amen the sun always comes
[47:03] out and I was kind of thinking about
[47:06] that
[47:07] today was we had a rainy day a couple
[47:10] days
[47:12] ago but the sun still came
[47:15] out a lot of times we don't I don't
[47:17] personally realize the sun's out it's
[47:19] just out there
[47:23] amen but I kind of started thinking
[47:25] about it
[47:27] and I realized that in order to reap
[47:29] those benefits that the son gives
[47:34] us we have to be out in the
[47:38] sun there's got to be contact with the
[47:40] sun
[47:41] amen amen if we want our Pentecostal
[47:45] [Music]
[47:46] experience it's not going to cut it just
[47:48] to come to church
[47:51] amen we have to have a relationship with
[47:55] God if we want God to come to
[47:58] us I don't know how many times I can
[48:02] count where I Crow to
[48:05] God and I want God to come on the
[48:08] scene but there's no relationship
[48:12] amen amen I don't know if we realize
[48:15] church but God when his holy spirit
[48:18] comes
[48:20] down he is impregnating us
[48:24] amen his spirit is living us inside of
[48:27] us
[48:29] amen and in order for that to happen
[48:31] there has to be a
[48:34] relationship amen just like the world
[48:37] revolves around the
[48:40] Sun our our world has to revolve around
[48:43] the son the Lord Jesus
[48:49] amen
[48:53] amen praise be to God
[49:09] amen I don't even know where to begin
[49:26] just a lot going on right now with
[49:33] me you talk about
[49:38] conditions and conditions change for me
[49:40] every
[49:42] day seems like there's so much stress
[49:45] all the
[49:47] time right in the
[49:50] morning you can
[49:54] ask I couldn't even hold something
[49:56] yesterday I was dropping
[50:01] it you know but in I think in those
[50:05] moments I think I personally I tend to
[50:07] hide myself you
[50:10] know um and that's opposite of what you
[50:13] should
[50:15] do you know I think that
[50:18] relationship that relationship with God
[50:20] is is that's when it should really come
[50:22] out you
[50:25] know is when you don't feel
[50:28] it amen a lot of times I tend to hide
[50:31] myself you
[50:33] know we hide ourselves in the
[50:36] shade you know and God only knows what
[50:38] we go through
[50:41] right
[50:43] um
[50:45] sorry yeah God only knows what we go
[50:47] through it's it's a personal battle for
[50:51] sure amen but you know the
[50:54] light the light it exposes
[50:59] amen and a lot of times that's what
[51:01] scares
[51:03] us when you get closer to God
[51:06] is everything else comes with
[51:09] it amen all of our sins all of our
[51:14] secrets they all come with it
[51:16] amen it brings them
[51:19] out but that's the only way that we can
[51:22] really truly know our condition
[51:27] and get better is if we come out into
[51:28] the
[51:30] light and man I think a lot of times for
[51:34] us we're just afraid of what people are
[51:36] going to think
[51:38] maybe or maybe we're
[51:42] ashamed you know and I get it you
[51:46] know our conditions are pretty bad
[51:50] sometimes but they don't get any better
[51:53] by us
[51:55] hiding amen I just ask that God you know
[51:58] God stand still long enough you
[52:02] know for me to get rid of this
[52:08] condition you know you sit here in the
[52:10] you read that story in the
[52:13] Bible where God stopped the
[52:17] Sun and uh he stopped the Sun for the
[52:19] children of
[52:21] Israel and Joshua said to him you know
[52:25] God he said God let the sun stand still
[52:29] long
[52:31] enough for me to avenge myself of my
[52:35] enemies and I liked that I was like you
[52:37] know what God give me the same
[52:39] Lord God stand still long
[52:42] enough for me to get rid of this
[52:46] stress stand so long enough for me to
[52:48] get rid of this
[52:51] anxiety stand still long enough for me
[52:53] to get rid of this depression
[52:58] this bad
[53:00] attitude these sins me being judgmental
[53:03] to my
[53:05] brother and you know and that's another
[53:07] thing
[53:08] too imagine if the children of Israel
[53:10] were fighting in
[53:13] darkness I can't be in one Accord with
[53:17] him or any of you for that
[53:20] matter if I'm in
[53:22] sin if I'm in
[53:24] darkness if I can't see my
[53:27] condition we're going to be fighting
[53:29] each
[53:30] other and God can't come
[53:32] down God needs one
[53:35] Accord God needs for us to be together
[53:40] amen amen I'll be closing with this
[53:45] quote from the message the resurrection
[53:47] of
[53:51] Lazarus it's paragraph 24
[53:59] says
[54:00] this it says notice that the angel of
[54:02] God will perform his
[54:06] word he'll bring his word to pass
[54:12] regardless when the season
[54:14] comes Harvesters
[54:18] arrive God is going to send his
[54:22] word and perform his things
[54:26] amen so this just tells us the prophet
[54:28] right there just told
[54:30] us that regardless of our
[54:33] season God's still going to come and and
[54:35] perform his
[54:39] word amen we just have to trust in
[54:43] that a lot of times I I don't have
[54:45] anything else to trust you
[54:49] know and I think that's the best way to
[54:52] be is when you don't have anything else
[54:53] to fall back on
[54:58] it's all
[54:59] God it's all up to God
[55:02] Amen and that's what brings you to
[55:06] Pentecost is you're not rolling the dice
[55:08] it's not a
[55:11] gamble but it's an
[55:13] assurance it's an assurance that there's
[55:15] light at the end of the
[55:18] tunnel if you notice all these people in
[55:20] the upper
[55:23] room they were all worshiping
[55:26] they were getting ready and God up in
[55:29] heaven
[55:31] above that began to pull him down
[55:35] amen amen our
[55:37] conditions regardless of what they
[55:39] are if we bring them to
[55:42] him he's going to come down regardless
[55:46] Brothers amen that's all I have God
[55:48] bless you
[55:51] [Applause]
[55:57] amen God bless
[55:59] you I believe God is already here
[56:02] tonight I believe he's already here
[56:05] working I hope that's not by feeling
[56:10] though but by
[56:12] faith knowing that God is
[56:16] working knowing that God is
[56:19] faithful when everything else seems
[56:23] contrary right away if you could please
[56:25] stand
[56:26] for the reading of the
[56:28] word Acts 2 verse 1-
[56:33] 4 says like this and when the day of
[56:37] Pentecost was fully come they were all
[56:39] with one Accord in one
[56:47] place and suddenly there came a sound
[56:49] from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind
[56:52] and it filled all the house where they
[56:54] were sitting
[57:05] and there appeared unto them clothing
[57:07] tongues like as of
[57:14] fire and it set upon each of
[57:19] them and they were all filled with the
[57:21] Holy Ghost and began to speak with other
[57:24] tongues as the spirit gave them
[57:34] UT may God add blessings to his word you
[57:36] may take your
[57:40] seats I'm just going to start off with
[57:42] the simple
[57:46] question how many are ready for a
[57:52] Pentecost tell yourselves right now
[57:56] how many want a new
[58:00] Pentecost do we want a new Pentecost
[58:04] Church how many want it
[58:07] tonight how many truly want a new
[58:09] Pentecost
[58:11] tonight how many want a new experience
[58:15] tonight how many want the Holy
[58:19] Spirit know the title in which I which
[58:22] we and my brother Diego have chosen
[58:28] was another
[58:31] Pentecost and if there's one thing
[58:34] certain if there's something that I
[58:36] truly
[58:38] believe is that we as one
[58:42] church we as one
[58:46] bride we we need another
[58:50] Pentecost see see brother brandham says
[58:53] it
[58:54] himself a real of
[59:00] Pentecost gathered as one
[59:03] heart one
[59:06] soul and one
[59:08] mind that is how God wants the
[59:12] church you see when the Bible talks to
[59:15] us about the
[59:17] Pentecost you know we must understand
[59:21] brothers that you see it's what we must
[59:25] understand is uh one thing to know about
[59:26] the story of
[59:32] Pentecost you know what does Pentecost
[59:36] mean what's the meaning behind
[59:40] Pentecost you know the Greek word for
[59:44] Pentecost signifies 50
[59:50] days why 50
[59:52] days you see the Pentecost
[59:56] it wasn't just one
[59:59] day the Pentecost wasn't just an event
[1:00:02] of one
[1:00:04] day you see the Bible shows
[1:00:07] us that it took many
[1:00:11] days it didn't take one
[1:00:13] day but many
[1:00:16] days it would took many
[1:00:18] days many days had to
[1:00:22] pass in order to fulfill the days of
[1:00:24] Pentecost
[1:00:28] you see but the day of
[1:00:30] Pentecost it didn't fulfill it didn't
[1:00:35] fulfill till Jesus resurrected from the
[1:00:42] grave you see there was 50
[1:00:45] days in which it had to
[1:00:48] happen in order for the Pentecost to
[1:00:50] fully
[1:00:53] come before the 50 days
[1:00:57] we know that Jesus had to go through the
[1:01:02] crucifixion that came the
[1:01:06] resurrection but something else came
[1:01:08] after the
[1:01:10] resurrection and that's something that
[1:01:12] we must
[1:01:14] understand the Bible shows us that on
[1:01:18] the third
[1:01:19] day when Jesus resurrected from the
[1:01:22] [Applause]
[1:01:24] grave appeared unto his
[1:01:28] disciples and he walked with them for 40
[1:01:32] days God resurrected on the third
[1:01:37] day and walked with the disciples for 40
[1:01:43] days acts
[1:01:48] 1:3 to whom also he shot himself alive
[1:01:52] after his Passion by many infallible
[1:01:54] proofs being SE of them 40 days and
[1:01:58] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[1:02:00] kingdom of
[1:02:15] God so we see that after the
[1:02:22] crucifixion his flesh died
[1:02:26] but his Spirit ra but his Spirit raised
[1:02:28] from the
[1:02:31] dead and brother Bram says that he was
[1:02:34] 40 days on Earth with
[1:02:39] men what happened after those 40
[1:02:43] days the the
[1:02:47] Ascension he was lifted up and
[1:02:52] raptured but before he was raptured or
[1:02:54] ascended
[1:02:59] he tells his
[1:03:01] disciples to go and
[1:03:05] wait wait for
[1:03:07] what what did they have to wait
[1:03:10] for you see the
[1:03:13] disciples they needed to
[1:03:15] wait so they seen the kingdom of
[1:03:19] God upon
[1:03:21] them you see they needed to
[1:03:24] wait till they were
[1:03:28] endured with the power from on
[1:03:31] high you see but what else did they have
[1:03:34] to wait
[1:03:36] for the promise in which Jesus gave
[1:03:40] them and church what was that
[1:03:43] promise what was the promise that he
[1:03:45] gave
[1:03:47] them brother
[1:03:49] says in which God said that he will come
[1:03:52] again and dwell among his people by the
[1:04:02] not by
[1:04:03] flesh not by flesh but by spiritual
[1:04:09] Revelation and let me tell you tonight
[1:04:12] Brothers let me tell you tonight that
[1:04:15] fulfilled
[1:04:17] promise brother brandom says that that
[1:04:19] fulfilled
[1:04:21] promise was John 1420
[1:04:26] and what's that
[1:04:28] promise but at that
[1:04:30] day ye shall know that I am in my
[1:04:35] father and ye in
[1:04:37] me and I in
[1:04:40] you that was the promise right there
[1:04:43] church you see in Acts chapter
[1:04:46] 2 in the inauguration of
[1:04:50] Pentecost we see the Apostle
[1:04:53] Paul here gathered with the other
[1:04:58] disciples and they are gathered in one
[1:05:03] Accord there are there are
[1:05:05] many there were many but they were in
[1:05:08] one
[1:05:11] Accord in in the upper
[1:05:14] room see brother Bram
[1:05:16] says that on that
[1:05:18] day about 120
[1:05:23] people men and women
[1:05:26] were in one Upper Room praying
[1:05:30] together you see and here we see
[1:05:33] them praying for 10
[1:05:36] days 10 days and 10 nights brother
[1:05:41] Bren 10 days and nights they had to
[1:05:44] wait they had to wait for
[1:05:48] Jesus so that he could pour himself onto
[1:05:53] them and something thing that we must
[1:05:57] understand is that they weren't going to
[1:05:59] receive that power from on high
[1:06:05] quickly they wer going to receive it
[1:06:07] right
[1:06:09] away see they had to prepare themselves
[1:06:15] spiritually they couldn't receive the
[1:06:17] spirit of Christ the way they
[1:06:20] were no brothers let me tell you
[1:06:23] something they had to correct themselves
[1:06:28] spiritually and they had to correct
[1:06:30] their
[1:06:32] [Applause]
[1:06:33] atmosphere in order for
[1:06:36] God you will be able to manifest in
[1:06:40] them you see they had to prepare
[1:06:43] themselves as
[1:06:45] one and in one
[1:06:48] Accord and that's the problem that we as
[1:06:51] a church
[1:06:53] have that's the problem that I
[1:06:56] have you see Brothers I include myself
[1:06:59] in this
[1:07:00] problem we we have become
[1:07:06] blind to the promise that God gave
[1:07:10] us God wants to abide in the
[1:07:14] church God wants to dwell in the
[1:07:18] church God wants to pour himself on the
[1:07:22] church you see but the problem is you
[1:07:25] see the problem is that there is no
[1:07:28] unity in the
[1:07:30] church there is no unity in the
[1:07:34] congregation we see Brothers
[1:07:37] gossiping we see brothers
[1:07:39] fighting we see Brothers talking behind
[1:07:42] their
[1:07:43] backs we see all this
[1:07:46] fighting but there's no
[1:07:48] unity and God can't work in un when
[1:07:51] there is no
[1:07:54] Unity you see there was a
[1:07:56] purpose for Why God sent the Holy
[1:08:00] Spirit it was so that he
[1:08:02] [Applause]
[1:08:03] himself the that same Pillar of
[1:08:07] Fire that was with the
[1:08:09] Israelites that same holy spirit that
[1:08:12] fell on
[1:08:15] Pentecost might dwell in this church
[1:08:20] too but what happened we have become too
[1:08:24] coldhearted
[1:08:27] our hearts are too
[1:08:27] [Applause]
[1:08:29] hardened we have become so cold
[1:08:33] brother too cold to the Holy
[1:08:38] Spirit brother Bram says we become so
[1:08:44] coldhearted to the point where we can't
[1:08:46] even shed one
[1:08:51] tear it's
[1:08:53] sad it's sad Brothers
[1:08:56] we can't even shed one tear
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:08:59] anymore because we are so spiritually
[1:09:03] dead spiritually
[1:09:05] cold you see brother the love of
[1:09:08] God seems to be pulling
[1:09:11] away we don't have the hunger for Christ
[1:09:15] anymore we don't have the thirst for
[1:09:17] Christ
[1:09:19] anymore we don't have the thirst or
[1:09:21] hunger for this message
[1:09:26] and this
[1:09:27] message this message it's a
[1:09:31] privilege it's a
[1:09:33] privilege because this is not for
[1:09:36] anybody this message is not for
[1:09:40] anybody message is for the
[1:09:43] bride but yet we don't have the hunger
[1:09:45] for
[1:09:47] it we don't have the thirst for
[1:09:50] it and I speak for
[1:09:53] myself because I I don't take that
[1:09:56] time to really dig myself in the message
[1:10:02] brother the fire the
[1:10:05] fire is gone brothers that
[1:10:08] fire that fire is no longer there in the
[1:10:12] church we as a
[1:10:15] church have taken a
[1:10:18] pattern a
[1:10:20] pattern that is not of the
[1:10:22] Bible that is not of the message
[1:10:26] you see
[1:10:27] youth we have confirmed
[1:10:31] ourselves to
[1:10:34] thinking that by going to
[1:10:37] church that is going to save us that by
[1:10:41] going to a congregation three times a
[1:10:45] week that's going to save us we have
[1:10:49] conf confirmed ourselves with
[1:10:53] thinking that by saying that we are
[1:10:57] Christians by saying that we know this
[1:11:01] message we're all good we don't have to
[1:11:04] do anything
[1:11:05] else let's just
[1:11:08] relax you see brother brandom says no
[1:11:12] wonder no wonder the church has gone to
[1:11:15] Sentimental feelings and
[1:11:19] emotions we have confirmed
[1:11:22] ourselves with emotions
[1:11:25] and
[1:11:27] feelings if the service isn't
[1:11:30] good if the preaching isn't
[1:11:34] good if the if if the whole service
[1:11:36] isn't
[1:11:38] good I'm going home man this isn't even
[1:11:41] worth it God's not even
[1:11:45] working it feels like God's God's God's
[1:11:48] away from
[1:11:49] us let me tell you something God isn't
[1:11:53] the one who
[1:11:54] moved God isn't the one who
[1:11:57] moved the one who Moved is
[1:12:00] us because we are so
[1:12:02] blind we are so
[1:12:04] blind you see to the point where we have
[1:12:07] gone to the old ways of this
[1:12:11] world and the truth of it is
[1:12:14] brothers and I say this for
[1:12:17] myself because I I don't stand behind
[1:12:19] this
[1:12:22] Pulpit as this holy person
[1:12:26] I'm a
[1:12:27] sinner I think I'm the worst sinner in
[1:12:29] this
[1:12:30] room that's how I think of
[1:12:34] myself and I want to tell you all
[1:12:36] tonight
[1:12:37] youth it's sad we try to live in
[1:12:42] sin and possess the holy ghost at the
[1:12:44] same
[1:12:47] time oh how we need a holy ghost
[1:12:53] Revival to clean up this
[1:12:57] Church something that I like that one
[1:12:59] that brother ber once
[1:13:03] said is that we as human
[1:13:06] beings we have serpents inside of
[1:13:10] us serpent is inside of
[1:13:13] us it doesn't matter who you
[1:13:16] are doesn't matter if you're a preacher
[1:13:19] doesn't matter if you're a musician
[1:13:20] doesn't matter if you work in the audio
[1:13:22] room it does not matter you have that
[1:13:26] serpent inside of
[1:13:28] you and that serpent will try its
[1:13:32] best to separate you from
[1:13:35] God little by little you see Brothers
[1:13:39] it's part of our
[1:13:40] nature it's part of our human
[1:13:43] nature our flesh doesn't want to have
[1:13:47] Fellowship our flesh doesn't want to go
[1:13:49] to
[1:13:50] church our flesh wants to stay at
[1:13:54] home flesh wants to go on the couch and
[1:13:56] watch
[1:13:58] Netflix our flesh just wants to
[1:14:01] relax our our flesh doesn't want want
[1:14:03] time to spend with God doesn't want
[1:14:05] fellowship with
[1:14:07] God you see this
[1:14:09] flesh prefers to be out there in the
[1:14:13] world and the truth of it
[1:14:16] is there is no desperation in
[1:14:21] us to receive more of God
[1:14:25] there is no desperation in
[1:14:28] us to go to
[1:14:30] church to get closer to God to grow more
[1:14:36] spiritually that desperation has G
[1:14:40] you it is gone you see I get
[1:14:45] desperate when my football team is
[1:14:49] playing I got to know if they're winning
[1:14:51] or losing I got to know if they're
[1:14:53] winning or losing
[1:14:56] otherwise I'm going go
[1:14:58] crazy you see sometimes we
[1:15:01] youth we are desperate to see when the
[1:15:03] service will
[1:15:07] end we are so desperate to see when
[1:15:09] church is going to be
[1:15:13] done so that we can go back
[1:15:15] home and go back to our
[1:15:18] routine so we can do what our flesh
[1:15:22] loves if the musicians may pass
[1:15:25] you see this
[1:15:27] flesh prefers to be out there in the
[1:15:30] world but where's the desperation of
[1:15:35] Christ where's the desperation of
[1:15:40] Christ I don't have the desperation
[1:15:44] Brothers I I'm not going to I'm not
[1:15:46] going to be behind this
[1:15:49] pulpit and act like a holy
[1:15:52] person I'm a sinner
[1:15:55] and I know that I don't have that
[1:15:58] desperation in
[1:16:00] me I haven't given it all for
[1:16:04] Christ we haven't given it all for
[1:16:07] Christ we haven't given it
[1:16:11] 100% why there's no unity in the
[1:16:15] church there's no unity in the
[1:16:20] congregation you see on that day of
[1:16:23] Pentecost when the pillar of
[1:16:26] fire when the Holy
[1:16:29] Spirit separated
[1:16:31] itself and settled itself onto the
[1:16:36] church it brought back the unified Body
[1:16:39] of
[1:16:42] Christ look at the church
[1:16:44] now look at the church
[1:16:47] now living in times of
[1:16:51] Separation you see not from the
[1:16:53] world but from the spirit of
[1:16:57] God but from the word of
[1:17:01] God see Brothers we live in
[1:17:04] times of denominational
[1:17:09] differences and those make me feel good
[1:17:14] doctrines you see the reason why the so
[1:17:17] many churches are losing their
[1:17:21] power why they're losing so much many
[1:17:23] power and losing their position
[1:17:27] in the body of
[1:17:28] Christ is because the church is not
[1:17:32] United the church is not in
[1:17:34] [Music]
[1:17:36] unity the family is not strong as
[1:17:40] one see God cannot manifest
[1:17:44] himself and reveal
[1:17:47] himself if the church is not spiritually
[1:17:52] United you see there is revelation in
[1:17:54] the the
[1:17:56] word when there is spiritual
[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:01] Unity
[1:18:03] stand you know we have the incorrect
[1:18:06] nature in US
[1:18:09] Brothers have the incorrect
[1:18:14] atmosphere and it's difficult for us to
[1:18:17] enter into the right
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:21] atmosphere you know it's difficult for
[1:18:23] us to give up
[1:18:25] [Music]
[1:18:27] it's difficult for us to give
[1:18:31] up what our flesh
[1:18:33] [Music]
[1:18:34] desires our flesh wants to stay at
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:39] home let's be honest our flesh doesn't
[1:18:41] want
[1:18:44] this don't try to act holy
[1:18:46] [Music]
[1:18:47] tonight don't be holy tonight brothers
[1:18:50] and
[1:18:51] sisters our flesh doesn't want to be
[1:18:54] here
[1:18:56] we don't want to sacrifice enough to the
[1:18:59] Lord and I know you it's difficult to
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:03] change I know it's difficult to
[1:19:08] change but I tell you
[1:19:11] tonight out there we won we won't find
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:15] anything it's a
[1:19:17] shame it's a shame that I call myself a
[1:19:22] Christian I call myself a Christian
[1:19:26] Christian and
[1:19:28] yet I go back to the things that I told
[1:19:30] God to bring me out
[1:19:33] [Music]
[1:19:35] of why do we resist the Holy Spirit
[1:19:41] Brothers why do we resist
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:19:44] it God wants to dwell inside of
[1:19:48] us but we just pull
[1:19:52] back we're too cold hard
[1:19:54] [Music]
[1:19:57] but
[1:19:58] Brothers God has everything that we
[1:20:02] need I could only say so much behind
[1:20:05] this
[1:20:08] pulit you can you have to make the
[1:20:10] decision
[1:20:12] tonight do we want to give everything
[1:20:15] for
[1:20:16] Christ it takes a
[1:20:19] sacrifice it takes a sacrifice to have
[1:20:21] the Holy Spirit
[1:20:25] you see but it's worth
[1:20:27] it you see because in the Holy
[1:20:30] Spirit there is fire and that fire when
[1:20:35] that fire comes
[1:20:37] down it burns out it burns it burns what
[1:20:42] what is impure inside of
[1:20:45] us and tonight
[1:20:47] church we
[1:20:49] burn we need to
[1:20:52] burn we need that fire
[1:20:55] set
[1:20:57] us so that we we may like
[1:21:01] God so that he could dwell in
[1:21:04] us remember
[1:21:07] youth God loves each and every one of
[1:21:11] us he just wants to dwell inside of
[1:21:15] us just open your
