Exodus 10. verziculotres verse 10 or verse 3. the word of the Lord says like this is foreign came into pharaoh and said unto him thus saith the Lord God the Hebrews how long will thou refuse to Humble thyself before me Let My People Go that they may serve me and I like how this version says it and it says like this let my people go so that they can worship me we're going to be reading verses five through seven Isaiah chapter 43 verses five six and seven Contigo for I'm with you generation is I will bring the acid from the East and gatherly from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the Earth even everyone that is called by my name for I have created him for my glory I have formed him yeah I have made him let's pray Brothers we give you thanks especially it's always precious to be here there's no way to repay you is these moments are unique they're a gift from you and I'm thankful for this thankful for my brothers for my sisters [Music] and give you all the honor and the Glory thank you for everything from the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated foreign with a purpose we were asked to share and this is in this service we place this as a question why are you here why are you here ask your neighbor yeah your husband or your wife why are you here amen God we have a god division we have a god of purpose that plans immediate and look one of his Visions is one of his purposes his greatest purpose is is the beautiful Plan of Salvation it's the plan restaurant first children how many of us have experienced salvation [Music] but I've been saved by faith another question ask your neighbors what was I saved for parakeet what was I saved for sorry you know dios God didn't save Abraham from Earth just because he was a good looking or a good fitment just because he wanted to save him for his glory and what did God save you for eign for that right I believe that's one of the greatest purposes God has for us God Saves us to worship Him to glorify him they say he says talking about worship and he said to worship is in part doing it with you with your mouth that's a part of it the majority of our worship is through our testimonies it's offering our love is giving a reverence it's putting ourselves put myself by your service how many believe it that way Jesus Corazon is Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind that is a purpose Brothers principal and I believe that ought to be our principal purpose our main focus look s and I think that a true worshiper he's going to worship and espirited and spirit and in truth he's going to worship him in the tribulation even in the darkness the true Son of God we're going to worship Him it doesn't matter if it's hot it doesn't matter if the time we're created for that safer that look dios God a new momento at one point or at one point he's going to let the enemy lose so he can take us through a certain tribulation and this happened to Joe you know the story of Joe he was a blessed man he had everything was fine with this everything was fine with his wife everything was fine with his health the dragon was there and he asked him where do you come from and he says I come from going to and fro um across the Earth and our brothers say in life scissors he feels comfortable on this Earth because there's a lot of sin man kills man there's a lot of unbelief he lies this Earth and God tells him have you considered my servant apart from Evil he he imparts himself from Evil is it I begin to meditate there was just one that had set himself apart from Evil rise righteous and fearing God of the world don't touch his soul saying goes he doesn't waste any time he begins to touch him in his material things afterwards he takes away his children and what is it that job does he's tribulated he's going through difficult times but even then he's still gone and he he rents his garments he shaves his head yeah and God gives he says I came from my mother and I'll leave in other words and I'll leave this world the same way material oh Man Meet it look dios Muska God seeks God seeks his children for them to worship him in the difficult times there's going to be someone that's going to worship but are they they're going to worship him when the uh when there's good times when the wallet is okay worshipers he wants those people even in the darkness he was incarcerated he was a prisoner not to a certain point basically speaking he had him the devil wanted to blur his vision wanted to Blind and spiritually how could he bend that man over son he wanted to blur his vision he wanted to Blind him with a hard piece of bread maybe with rats spiders there in his cell yeah it was something special something [Music] and God tells us don't fear for I Am With You they say look how even being a tribulated he didn't want to leave his purpose you don't want to lose his purpose his vision and he told him yes let's Silas the scene and Silas answers him and he says I can I'm hungry I'm scared I can't sing Paul Silas silence [Music] thank you see us silence amen [Music] [Music] I Won't Go Back [Music] sorry you know doors oh my God Paulo okay yesterday that star last he was tribe is what material he was made from the Pronto and soon enough this body binds us we're closed off in this body this body doesn't like it is we were saved for yes in this message believe me from the heart this is when I think that God puts in his church the best that he can find um wasting you the best that's all it's rusted what purpose do we have here test the greatness of his power by time tested materials [Music] we take God at his words no matter what the symptoms the circumstances [Music] you know what you know what martyr quieres once the Earth says in Greek it means in Greek means uh witness in Greek has tried throughout time throughout all the ages those Martyrs foreign God bless you [Applause] God bless you brother I like amen what a beautiful word seven do you know many people have been deceived christianism many people think Christianity is a bed of roses that's not the Christianity I know the Lord said this in the world you have affliction he said that in the world you have affliction something that I love that it says says in the world he said you'll have affliction but trust I have overcome the world in the world you have many afflictions Paul and Silas were in prison Hallelujah Pere is but they were really not imprisoned you in this morning you might feel that you're caged in now you're in a prisoners maybe you're bound maybe you're under those bars and you know one thing why we can't make it to our purpose because many times is stopping us we will never advance on this Earth we will never advance I like Isaiah it says Isaiah 44 2. why are you here why brethren he said what did you come to see what did you come to see this morning would you come for a good hearing preaching a good sounding preaching did you come to see the brothers did you see how great our pastor preaches there's nothing wrong with that that's good what is the point for me to see God in my past if no one can see God in Me to see God in someone else [Music] walking in flesh thank you says I am God your creator [Music] I don't know who has told you that you're not good for anything I'm not sure if anyone's told you that but I don't think it's coming from somebody greater than the one that's speaking here he is I am God your creator nobody gives anything for you but here it says I am your creator I have formed you before you were born he is what do you have inside he knows foreign [Music] that what's inside me yeah now here's the detail he knows what's in you do you know what's in you those brother Fidel know what's in him for game birds I'm speaking what I'm I'm not speaking I'm letting the Holy Ghost guide me I'm just letting the Holy Ghost flow I Believe what my brothers the Holy Ghost is working in somebody I'm not sure who but he is working in someone you know one thing brother God's children are different I'm going to tell you one thing yeah I spoke with brother Edward many times I didn't ask to be a Christian maybe someone identifies here I never asked I never asked to be a Christian [Music] didn't let me as much as you want to go to the world what else can I say about this sometimes we want to run we want to run he's odd I remember brother Familia I had my family they Rejoice I wanted to dance with them I wanted to be with them I had cousins that would use drugs there's a cousin we went to uh parties with he would go to the restroom and he would come out with his mouth crooked wiping his nose God never allowed that all right and you say because you're a good birthday then no no he simply didn't let me guess maybe he thought that if I got that I would go um there was something strange in me brother there was something odd I thought I was the son of this world but I couldn't fit there why are you here why are we here brethren seven you know foreign I believe we're very different we're very different brother and now you have things to a very special person my grandmother if I've seen God existed and I believe God exists was in my grandmother you know one thing brother I remember I would come back home earlier and you know what that old lady was doing she was kneeling kneeling there was a rug there are carpets all concrete and dirt she spent hours praying foreign [Music] you can [Music] you know one thing brother is the subscribe my grandmother has been ill physically I do feel sad sometimes because of the separation pero located but I believe that's how the Christians should be my brother told me he asked my grandmother I think my sister-in-law if she was ready to meet her maker meet her Lord as she said she was do you know why brother because what we preach we've heard it well we speak manifest many say I'm going with him I'm going with him but not right now Lord not right now why don't we say or why do we say that because we're not ready came to search for a bride a different bride is and brother John spoke about Abraham yeah spoke about Abraham right [Music] but I enjoy when Rebecca is mentioned Rebecca Is Us in an actual time brother Branham says I love how he says that in English I wonder antes I wonder why Rebecca came before any of the other girls don't you ask yourself why you yeah why are you different why can't why even if you walk everything inside why you can't go why is did you know that Rebecca and Isaac were blood relatives here's the key porque State because you know don't belong in this world is different your DNA is different we have different dnas we all have the DNA of Jesus they say he said for blood relatives Primos cousins and the pride of Jesus Christ is a blood relationship with him foreign the angel when to prepare Rebecca no because Rebecca was good no because Rebecca was a blood relative she was Kinsmen Redeemer yeah there was something inside her manifestation you don't know you preach about Jesus Jesus how do you know Jesus existed it is written look brother says sometimes we don't know many things but one thing I do know that is written that he overcame [Music] circumstances it doesn't matter if he overcame I will overcome it looks Church you are different I I feel like I'm I'm a repeater well that's who I am different I'm an eagle I'm an eagle yes now the question is what is leading you is Santo is that is why I today I believe that those who have been born again those that are filled with the Holy Spirit are connected with God and are Guided by his Spirit that's why they act in such a peculiar way why are you here what did you come to see because if you came to see something good apart there's nothing else good you know that's why many people go back to the world because they come even and see problems sometimes the brother does this the sister does that I'm living because there's only Hypocrites that's all right bye circumstances [Music] thank you Father very amazing [Music] please stand [Music] and this morning if something is stopping you you could okay I believe he is here the same holy spirit that guided Rebecca I believe it's the same holy ghost that is here that same Holy Ghost came and prepared the place for me now it's up to us it's up to you and me it's up to me that I want just another service will you return home to be the same person or say Lord Here Am I who kills I want to be different I don't want to be the same person so you want to be the same person you say I don't want to be that same here why Lord help me I tell him I don't want
