[45:31] brotherr our subject is fighting for
[45:37] souls and for a title me and my brother
[45:39] Alex have titled this
[45:42] sermon with the inspiration of the Holy
[45:46] Ghost you
[45:50] matter I matter Brethren you
[45:54] matter
[45:57] everyone in here
[45:59] matters and also the ones outside
[46:01] matters because I believe with all my
[46:05] heart that there are many children of
[46:07] God out
[46:08] there there are many children of God out
[46:11] there there are many Souls
[46:15] crying
[46:17] crying for the holy spirit amen
[46:21] brother now my
[46:23] question what are you going to
[46:27] about
[46:34] it because you believe God is in his
[46:37] children now what is God going to
[46:40] do after this
[46:44] service what are we going to
[46:47] do I ask myself this what am I going to
[46:52] do
[46:53] after God spoke to me
[46:57] so our title is you matter am amen
[47:03] Brothers we thank God for our
[47:07] pastor how the Holy Ghost has been
[47:10] working with
[47:12] him and how that wakes us
[47:16] up that our soul
[47:19] matters God's Souls
[47:22] matter because for a Time
[47:26] the
[47:28] souls his
[47:30] children were with him am amen
[47:36] Brothers in some time we were with
[47:40] God now if we are
[47:45] here
[47:48] only and for the great love he has
[47:51] towards
[47:52] us that's the reason why we are here
[47:57] and that doesn't make us better than the
[47:59] ones out there
[48:01] no
[48:03] we should be so
[48:06] glad that God has us
[48:09] here hearing God's
[48:12] word and now I believe with all my
[48:16] heart that the souls out there are
[48:19] crying out are crying
[48:23] out for someone to
[48:26] them for someone to speak to them of the
[48:29] greatness of God
[48:32] yesen
[48:34] Amen
[48:40] looken let's bring this scene a
[48:43] little of Adam and
[48:45] Eve and I'm thankful to
[48:49] God because the spirit
[48:52] through speaking with our brother Eric
[48:57] it hit my heart when he shared this with
[49:00] me and that's where I want to take my
[49:05] thought now we're going to draw a
[49:07] picture this morning who was Adam who
[49:11] was Eve
[49:14] Adam was the son of God that God
[49:20] chose to be in that Garden of Eden yes
[49:25] brother
[49:27] now
[49:30] God God put
[49:32] Adam in that
[49:41] place for a
[49:45] job and inside of
[49:48] that after some
[49:52] time God decided to give him a wife
[49:56] wife that in that
[49:59] time was the
[50:02] female that we now know as
[50:06] Eve now why did I read this verse
[50:09] because this scripture
[50:11] says that sin came through
[50:14] a resurrection would come through a man
[50:16] also Amen brother
[50:20] now who sined who sinned first
[50:25] it was Adam who sin because
[50:29] sin is with
[50:32] knowledge if you do things knowing that
[50:36] is
[50:37] sin but the word says that Eve says that
[50:41] Eve was deceived Eve was deceived by the
[50:46] serpent by the Devil
[50:48] Himself that he got in that
[50:51] c now that
[50:54] devil is still Among Us he still is
[51:00] working and
[51:01] fighting against God's
[51:04] children now who would have
[51:07] thought such a perfect
[51:12] creation and that the devil could
[51:15] pervert in that clean
[51:18] Place only God's presence
[51:21] dwells and now Satan that is so subtle
[51:26] could get in that
[51:29] Serpent and could deceive the
[51:32] creation God set in that
[51:35] place now that's where Eve was Now
[51:39] Eve Eve was
[51:43] deceived but just meditate a
[51:47] little what Adam was going through when
[51:50] his
[51:51] wife when his
[51:53] beloved what he loved the most was
[51:57] deceived by that
[52:03] serpent what crossed Adam's
[52:07] mind what could you imagine that Adam
[52:10] was going
[52:12] through when he seen even that falling
[52:15] condition see her
[52:19] destroyed imagine Adam's
[52:22] pain that he had to redeem her
[52:26] had to cover
[52:29] her had to pay a
[52:32] price had to let
[52:36] go how much did it
[52:39] not to leave God's
[52:42] presence to redeem his
[52:45] wife imagine
[52:48] brother Adam was reflecting in that
[52:51] moment was God's
[52:54] characteristics for a soul for one Soul
[52:59] now
[53:00] brother let's bring it to our
[53:03] lives what are we doing with our
[53:06] families what are we doing with our
[53:10] children with our husbands and our
[53:14] wives those are
[53:16] souls that are
[53:18] Priceless
[53:20] nevertheless the
[53:22] devil has come into our mind
[53:29] so bother us and take us out of God's
[53:32] perfect when you're in God's
[53:35] presence when you're in God's
[53:37] presence everything is perfect yes
[53:41] brother when you come to
[53:44] church and the holy spirit moves
[53:46] everything is perfect everything is
[53:50] perfect when you leave these
[53:52] doors you face the reality of
[53:56] with problems with
[53:58] trials everything the devil has out
[54:03] there and that's what makes you think a
[54:13] little how much did it hurt
[54:17] Adam to let go of
[54:20] everything or leave everything to redeem
[54:23] his wife yes
[54:27] brother now everything is a perfect plan
[54:29] from
[54:31] God although we don't understand at the
[54:35] moment everything is God's perfect
[54:38] plan because if that hadn't
[54:41] happened we would not be here yes
[54:45] Breen Adam said I
[54:49] I I have to pay a
[54:52] price I need to do it no one else I got
[54:57] to do it God when he saw
[55:02] that how do you think God
[55:07] felt he must have had
[55:10] a to
[55:14] see what condition his children were and
[55:17] he
[55:18] also
[55:20] thought
[55:22] who
[55:23] I I will
[55:27] go I will go and pay the
[55:29] price he
[55:32] descended flesh and
[55:35] body to dwell in this earth and he paid
[55:39] the price for us for his children
[55:44] why because he loves us because he loves
[55:48] you he loves
[55:51] you loves us
[55:54] brethren
[55:56] that should make us
[55:58] be so know that it's God's
[56:02] love here with a
[56:11] purpose why is it hard to come to church
[56:13] and hear his
[56:14] word and why is it
[56:16] easy go to the world and
[56:19] be but look brother a Son of
[56:23] God it hurts to Son of God when he makes
[56:27] a
[56:28] mistake there's a pain in the Son of God
[56:31] look brother how the devil is that
[56:34] little by
[56:36] little he's keeping you dormant yes
[56:41] brotherr it's little by
[56:45] little it's the opposite of the
[56:47] word little here a little there yes
[56:51] [Music]
[56:53] brother the devil is the same same way
[57:03] now when the Lord
[57:07] Jesus decided to come for you and
[57:12] I it's because he loved
[57:14] me because he loved
[57:17] you yes
[57:19] brethren
[57:23] lookis
[57:27] Genesis 3
[57:29] ver9 it
[57:35] says and the Lord God called unto Adam
[57:38] and said unto him where are thou who it
[57:42] was
[57:43] God it was God searching for us it was
[57:46] God searching
[57:48] for it was God searching for his
[57:50] children today in this time in this hour
[57:53] in this moment it's God searching for
[57:59] you what will you do with that
[58:02] call God wants
[58:04] you and God is telling you where art
[58:08] thou amen
[58:11] Brethren that's what God has told me
[58:14] where are thou Marshall what are you
[58:16] doing yes
[58:20] Brethren because I'm a man as you
[58:23] are
[58:25] I make
[58:27] mistakes I
[58:30] think I'm going to speak brother also a
[58:34] little of the maniac of
[58:41] gadera who was this
[58:48] Gan brother brandham says he was a
[58:53] man
[58:58] brother Bram was drawing a
[59:03] picture that maybe this man went to
[59:06] church he was a good
[59:11] man reputation maybe as you and I are
[59:15] right we come to
[59:16] church are message
[59:18] [Music]
[59:23] believer
[59:27] all of a sudden we want to show that
[59:28] we're
[59:29] important but I tell you one thing
[59:33] brother the only one that's important is
[59:35] our Lord Jesus Christ Amen
[59:37] brother the pastor was telling
[59:40] us of this little
[59:45] man that weighed 150
[59:48] pound just like this little
[59:51] man that almost weighs around 150 pounds
[59:57] the most that he was worth was 84
[1:00:00] cents now this flesh you see standing up
[1:00:03] here is
[1:00:05] only worth 84
[1:00:07] cents but what's inside this man there's
[1:00:11] a value of more than 10,000 worlds in
[1:00:16] this man there's a
[1:00:18] value that there's nothing in this world
[1:00:21] that can pay for
[1:00:23] it
[1:00:27] now we heard brother say a soul is worth
[1:00:28] more than
[1:00:30] 10,000 and in this message that I
[1:00:34] found says that they're worth 10
[1:00:36] millions in other
[1:00:39] words, 1,000 time 10,000 oh
[1:00:45] brotherr we should
[1:00:47] Rejoice that your soul is worth more
[1:00:51] than 10 millions of worlds you are
[1:00:56] Priceless hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:02] Brethren now that's why I
[1:01:06] understand why the pastor speaks so us
[1:01:09] because he about God's Souls hallelujah
[1:01:14] hallelujah yes
[1:01:17] brother your souls matter to
[1:01:20] God and if we are God's
[1:01:23] children
[1:01:26] God's Soul should matter to me do they
[1:01:29] matter to you how much do they matter to
[1:01:35] you have you thought about that
[1:01:38] Brethren if they don't
[1:01:41] matter if this has gotten to
[1:01:44] me that my soul matters to
[1:01:47] me how will the rest matter to
[1:01:52] me until you need to realize
[1:01:56] that my soul is
[1:01:57] priceless Amen
[1:02:00] brother to understand someone
[1:02:02] else you must understand
[1:02:05] yourself to know someone else's value
[1:02:09] you need to know your own value amen
[1:02:12] then Breen that tells
[1:02:15] me that need to take care of what God
[1:02:18] has given me now
[1:02:22] looken look at this
[1:02:25] here in this town in
[1:02:28] gader there was this
[1:02:30] man man of good
[1:02:33] reputation but brother Bram
[1:02:36] says all of a sudden he was in
[1:02:40] church maybe someone insults
[1:02:44] him maybe someone
[1:02:46] makes or
[1:02:49] Com or they began to criticize
[1:02:52] him and he found out
[1:02:55] he heard and asked
[1:02:58] himself how is it that in a church of
[1:03:01] the
[1:03:03] message that we believe in the
[1:03:06] Supernatural where the holy spirit
[1:03:09] says how can they talk bad about me how
[1:03:13] can they say that about me yes
[1:03:16] brotherr it happens too many it happens
[1:03:19] to
[1:03:19] me don't don't think you're the only one
[1:03:23] it happens to me also
[1:03:25] and I ask for forgiveness because I've
[1:03:28] realized how valuable you are to
[1:03:33] God how valuable your soul
[1:03:36] is I should be more careful I should
[1:03:40] walk speak
[1:03:42] different behave different because it's
[1:03:45] your soul and your soul is
[1:03:48] priceless and who am
[1:03:51] I to tell you how much you worth when
[1:03:54] God's word tells
[1:03:56] us that you're worth more than this
[1:03:59] earth now there was this man
[1:04:02] here who was going to be able to help
[1:04:05] him a man that had
[1:04:08] Legion that had many
[1:04:11] demons for one thing like that brother
[1:04:14] says that maybe he began to
[1:04:17] drink and there he caught a
[1:04:19] demon maybe he began to
[1:04:22] steal and he got another
[1:04:26] and maybe he was a little
[1:04:29] Lial and he got to the point
[1:04:32] says so where the demons dominated
[1:04:37] him but there was one man one
[1:04:41] man that hurt his
[1:04:43] cry that hurt that
[1:04:46] soul and didn't stay
[1:04:48] still he had to cross the sea Waters
[1:04:52] stormy seas yes Breen and there he was
[1:04:57] there he was on his way
[1:04:59] searching for for
[1:05:02] who that was crying out for a
[1:05:08] Deliverance there I was crying for a
[1:05:13] Deliverance that's how I was yes
[1:05:17] brother
[1:05:19] forgot where God has brought you from
[1:05:23] remember where you come from and that
[1:05:26] will help
[1:05:30] you that will help you feel for everyone
[1:05:34] else to cry with your brother amen
[1:05:41] Brethren the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:05:46] knew there was a soul crying out when he
[1:05:49] got there when he got
[1:05:53] there he saw him he saw
[1:05:57] him and the demons did not wait from him
[1:06:00] because it wasn't time it wasn't time
[1:06:04] but for
[1:06:05] God the right time is when he descends
[1:06:08] on the scene he begins to work with his
[1:06:12] children then it's time many
[1:06:16] times us as
[1:06:18] humans we say it's not yet it's not my
[1:06:22] time
[1:06:23] yet but when it's God's time it's not
[1:06:26] your
[1:06:27] time because my thoughts are not God's
[1:06:31] thoughts nor my words it's his
[1:06:42] words glory to
[1:06:46] God there was that Soul
[1:06:48] crying that Soul was crying brother Bram
[1:06:53] says
[1:06:56] those demons gave so much strength to
[1:06:59] that he was three times stronger than a
[1:07:02] regular
[1:07:03] man he has more strength three times
[1:07:07] stronger from a regular
[1:07:09] man what
[1:07:11] about man of God filled with the
[1:07:16] Holy strength should he have to lift his
[1:07:20] hands to say Thank You Lord hallelujah
[1:07:25] hallelujah how much
[1:07:27] more should you have to say Thank You
[1:07:31] Lord thank you for your holy
[1:07:34] spirit thank you for delivering me thank
[1:07:37] you Lord for my
[1:07:40] healing how much more what do we need
[1:07:43] Church fours
[1:07:46] fours what has God called us
[1:07:49] for to save
[1:07:51] souls to speak to the people

[1:08:01] shamed of
[1:08:03] hearing you weren't ashamed of that no
[1:08:06] brother we were not ashamed of that
[1:08:10] no and now that we have the greatest
[1:08:13] God's
[1:08:16] love why can't we
[1:08:18] testify of what God is doing today in my
[1:08:22] life where God has brought me out
[1:08:26] of from how many things hasn't God
[1:08:29] healed how many things hasn't God saved
[1:08:31] me from oh
[1:08:34] brother there are millions of
[1:08:37] things we could testify of God bless
[1:08:43] you
[1:08:47] wow brother Marshall he's uh he's on
[1:08:50] fire
[1:08:52] today
[1:08:58] if you can just stand with me for a few
[1:09:03] minutes you can open your Bible with me
[1:09:05] just to stretch a
[1:09:08] little First Corinthians chapter
[1:09:12] 2 verse one and
[1:09:18] on read verse one and verse two and then
[1:09:21] you can take your
[1:09:22] seat
[1:09:27] you matter in this
[1:09:31] morning when you have if you can say
[1:09:36] Amen the word of God
[1:09:51] says and I brotherr when I came to you
[1:09:53] came not with Excellency of speech or of
[1:09:56] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[1:09:58] of
[1:10:11] God for I determine not to know anything
[1:10:14] among you save Jesus Christ and him
[1:10:19] crucified brother thank
[1:10:22] you
[1:10:24] the apost
[1:10:31] Paul after he had his experience with
[1:10:34] the pillar of
[1:10:36] fire his life
[1:10:40] changed never the same he
[1:10:43] was something
[1:10:45] happened in that
[1:10:50] trip on his way to persecute Christians
[1:10:56] he had a supernatural
[1:11:11] experience I'm thinking in English this
[1:11:13] morning brother and something happened
[1:11:15] to
[1:11:16] him something happened to
[1:11:19] him he was never the
[1:11:22] same
[1:11:24] after he had that
[1:11:28] experience the Bible says he went to
[1:11:32] Arabia for three
[1:11:36] years to make
[1:11:41] sure that the experience that he
[1:11:44] received was
[1:11:47] real he wanted to make
[1:11:50] sure that it wasn't a tale
[1:11:55] that it wasn't just a
[1:11:58] feeling an emotion he
[1:12:01] had he wanted to make
[1:12:05] sure that that experience was from
[1:12:12] God after those three
[1:12:16] years the Bible tells
[1:12:21] us and brother brandham opens up
[1:12:24] the
[1:12:30] picture when he returns to
[1:12:35] Jerusalem he is searching for
[1:12:44] Peter he searches for a man that had
[1:12:47] time spend time with
[1:12:50] Jesus because there's something special
[1:12:56] about a person when she spent time with
[1:13:00] Jesus the people of today let me tell
[1:13:03] you will
[1:13:08] notice when a person has been with
[1:13:12] Jesus we're no
[1:13:15] longer in the Dark
[1:13:20] Ages when people were doing things
[1:13:22] blindly
[1:13:24] not
[1:13:25] anymore people know enough
[1:13:28] now people know too
[1:13:30] [Music]
[1:13:31] much books where people find
[1:13:36] out and it's
[1:13:40] hard to speak to one soul today
[1:13:44] yes we are sincere
[1:13:46] today it's
[1:13:52] hard but when Paul descends to Jerusalem
[1:13:55] and meets with
[1:13:57] Peter brother Bram
[1:14:00] says that they saw eye to
[1:14:03] eye that their
[1:14:06] doctrines match so
[1:14:09] much that they may eye to
[1:14:12] eye and Paul could find
[1:14:16] out that his experience was
[1:14:22] real
[1:14:25] and time
[1:14:33] passes Paul had to express his
[1:14:40] experience he wanted to give a
[1:14:45] testimony because when a person has had
[1:14:47] an encounter with
[1:14:50] God when a person has had an encounter
[1:14:52] with God
[1:14:54] I
[1:14:55] believe they cannot stay
[1:14:57] quiet I
[1:15:00] believe they have to be that
[1:15:03] light that
[1:15:06] light for a dark
[1:15:09] world so
[1:15:13] Paul on his second missionary
[1:15:17] trip the Bible
[1:15:20] tells he went to Corinth cor
[1:15:27] Corinth is in
[1:15:31] Greece the people of
[1:15:36] Greece let me tell you they were very
[1:15:44] religious if you think you're religious
[1:15:46] for coming to church dressing well
[1:15:47] looking
[1:15:49] well the people in
[1:15:52] Corinth
[1:15:55] they were dedicated people to their gods
[1:15:58] they had their
[1:16:00] gods they had their
[1:16:02] Idols they had their
[1:16:09] synagogues and Paul moved by the Holy
[1:16:13] Spirit to go to Corinth in
[1:16:18] Greece the Bible doesn't tell how he got
[1:16:20] to
[1:16:21] Corinth nor the
[1:16:26] journey but the thing is that when he
[1:16:29] arrived to
[1:16:31] Corinth he is meeting
[1:16:34] people that knew a
[1:16:37] lot
[1:16:39] yes they had their
[1:16:42] de they had their
[1:16:48] gods and when
[1:16:52] Paul
[1:16:55] finds out what type of people live
[1:16:59] there I'm GNA give you an
[1:17:03] example the Pagan man back then the
[1:17:07] common
[1:17:08] man had three
[1:17:13] wives many of us we have enough with
[1:17:18] one but the common man had three
[1:17:22] wives his
[1:17:24] wife who gave him his
[1:17:28] children had his uh
[1:17:31] Cony no
[1:17:37] just he had a slave that he would just
[1:17:39] sleep with as many times as they
[1:17:42] wanted and then they had their
[1:17:46] concubine the one that he would
[1:17:49] go to put it up for
[1:17:52] exhibition
[1:17:56] and Paul finds out these people were
[1:18:05] lost and Paul says how can I present
[1:18:08] them
[1:18:14] Christ how can I make the people
[1:18:20] listen and pay attention to what I need
[1:18:22] to say
[1:18:24] are you following me till
[1:18:28] now so
[1:18:30] Paul begins to say these
[1:18:42] words verse one and I brother when I
[1:18:45] came to you came now with Excellency of
[1:18:46] speech or of wisdom declaring unto you
[1:18:48] the testimony of
[1:18:51] God the first thing Paul
[1:18:54] realizes and
[1:18:58] catches is that he had not his own
[1:19:05] testimony he had it for
[1:19:08] dung everything he had done the past his
[1:19:13] education his
[1:19:18] credentials a Roman
[1:19:21] citizen he had it for
[1:19:24] T he had nothing of himself that's why
[1:19:27] he
[1:19:29] said testimony of
[1:19:32] God God did for
[1:19:35] you I did for
[1:19:37] you done for
[1:19:41] you I believe that's the problem
[1:19:43] today I want to show what I
[1:19:46] know
[1:19:48] abilities
[1:19:51] capabilities and people don't want to
[1:19:52] see that
[1:19:55] anymore resurrected
[1:20:01] Christ I ain't
[1:20:04] here I can be very faulty and I
[1:20:07] am but I'm not
[1:20:10] here because someone preached nice to
[1:20:14] me because someone encouraged me to be
[1:20:16] here brainwash me
[1:20:20] no someone proved
[1:20:23] Jesus Christ out of history and
[1:20:26] presented him
[1:20:31] now because we know a
[1:20:35] lot but we have not one
[1:20:38] evidence we cannot prove Jesus Christ is
[1:20:42] living today that's where the problem
[1:20:50] is so Paul found that out
[1:21:00] and he found out he couldn't only rely
[1:21:02] on persuasive
[1:21:06] words although Paul could be
[1:21:10] persuasive Paul was a doctor of the
[1:21:14] law if anyone could
[1:21:18] speak Peter couldn't even write his
[1:21:21] name but Peter had the power of Jesus
[1:21:26] Christ what the world
[1:21:30] needs it's a lived
[1:21:37] life Paul finds
[1:21:41] out he was an open
[1:21:48] book that's why Paul in his
[1:21:51] letters
[1:21:54] he tells the
[1:22:00] Corinthians ye are
[1:22:08] letters written in our
[1:22:13] hearts known and read for through
[1:22:16] men by
[1:22:20] men an Asian women
[1:22:30] just learn to
[1:22:32] read and says open
[1:22:38] books a Chinese woman who had just
[1:22:41] learned to
[1:22:42] read
[1:22:44] prayed
[1:22:51] saying
[1:22:53] Lord we are going to work among many
[1:22:55] people who cannot read
[1:23:04] Lord make our lives open
[1:23:10] Bibles so that those who cannot read the
[1:23:14] book can read it in
[1:23:17] us I don't know about you this
[1:23:20] morning but I'm an open book
[1:23:23] an open
[1:23:30] book and we ask ourselves why can't we
[1:23:33] rescue
[1:23:41] Souls we are speaking of rescuing Souls
[1:23:46] right Paul we can learn a lot
[1:23:51] from
[1:23:53] verse four
[1:23:57] says 1 Corinthians
[1:24:00] 2:4 and my
[1:24:03] speech and my
[1:24:10] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:24:13] man's
[1:24:15] Wisdom no
[1:24:21] no you this morning can you are very
[1:24:24] wise I respect
[1:24:30] that but you cannot make an impact in
[1:24:32] this life in this world we
[1:24:36] living the people don't need to see
[1:24:38] people that know a
[1:24:39] lot I know a lot of
[1:24:43] people know a lot about history know a
[1:24:45] lot
[1:24:48] about well that's not what people are
[1:24:51] looking for in a person
[1:24:54] and Paul
[1:24:55] understands and he says I need to
[1:24:59] come
[1:25:01] demonstration of the spirit and power
[1:25:04] you know what
[1:25:07] brother you have a demonstration
[1:25:10] follow that people can
[1:25:13] see when you've been with god brother
[1:25:16] Brom
[1:25:18] says give me five
[1:25:21] minutes if they have the Holy
[1:25:28] Ghost my problem
[1:25:30] sometimes is that I haven't
[1:25:33] understood I need to spend more time
[1:25:35] with
[1:25:36] him there has to be less of and more of
[1:25:40] God I need to
[1:25:43] Wayne so he can grow you know what
[1:25:47] church I find
[1:25:49] out that truly we do not love the souls
[1:25:54] we don't have love for
[1:25:57] love
[1:25:59] stir pain for the
[1:26:10] people says that the
[1:26:14] people are
[1:26:18] dying take them to Christ
[1:26:28] what we
[1:26:32] realize
[1:26:39] that when he understood the experience
[1:26:41] he
[1:26:43] had he
[1:26:46] realized that he would be the
[1:26:51] mediator for the
[1:26:53] [Music]
[1:26:55] people to see
[1:27:00] God when it's open to
[1:27:03] us we can say it and we are saying
[1:27:09] it but when the knowledge is open in
[1:27:13] us and we can truly
[1:27:15] understand that the
[1:27:18] people what they want to see is God and
[1:27:22] that
[1:27:23] you can be that
[1:27:28] person present a resurrected
[1:27:32] Christ then it matters when how we
[1:27:35] speak it does matter how I
[1:27:39] behave what type of language I
[1:27:44] have one occasion
[1:27:47] Peter wasn't converted Yet brother
[1:27:51] Edward so he was a little like
[1:27:57] this and Jesus Christ was about to be
[1:28:02] crucified and he was running away
[1:28:05] Brethren all of a sudden he joins a
[1:28:09] group and they ask him
[1:28:12] hey weren't you the one that was with
[1:28:15] Jesus no no no no no not
[1:28:21] me but I'm almost sure
[1:28:24] you oh that's how we are
[1:28:27] church not me I don't go to
[1:28:31] church your speech gives you
[1:28:40] up there was a brother that went to
[1:28:43] Mexico
[1:28:44] City to
[1:28:51] evangelize
[1:28:53] he had plans to visit his
[1:28:58] family but his excuse was to tell the
[1:29:01] pastor I'm going to go evangelize so the
[1:29:02] pastor could let him
[1:29:04] go don't worry that brother is not
[1:29:10] here and when the brother returned the
[1:29:14] p with your
[1:29:18] family they didn't even notice that I
[1:29:20] was a Christian
[1:29:27] brother Bram
[1:29:31] says and the message seeing his
[1:29:35] star even the title has a lot to
[1:29:42] speak brother brandham says what is the
[1:29:46] gospel what is the Gospel
[1:29:50] Church many say it's this
[1:29:54] Bible I tell you that it's this
[1:29:59] Bible people don't want to know a lot
[1:30:01] about this they want to see that
[1:30:05] here you know
[1:30:07] why I'm get in trouble
[1:30:11] but I begin to think when the angel
[1:30:13] tells
[1:30:14] John stop
[1:30:17] writing it's because you know what
[1:30:20] church it wasn't so much about writing
[1:30:25] anymore what was going to happen was
[1:30:27] going to happen
[1:30:28] in and human
[1:30:32] Epistles we'll leave that
[1:30:36] for the
[1:30:38] seven for those that like to study these
[1:30:44] things but brother what is the gospel
[1:30:47] the musicians can
[1:30:50] come
[1:30:57] the gospel come not only through the
[1:30:59] word but through Power and
[1:31:00] demonstrations of the Holy
[1:31:02] Ghost and these signs shall accompany
[1:31:05] those that
[1:31:09] believe signs
[1:31:11] church signs follow
[1:31:17] you we're no longer in the
[1:31:20] Pentecost and the greatest was speaking
[1:31:23] in
[1:31:27] Tong signs to follow
[1:31:29] me life of Jesus Christ in human flesh
[1:31:34] in a
[1:31:37] man that is
[1:31:44] greater brother Bram
[1:31:47] says that's what we
[1:31:50] need today
[1:31:59] brother the world's asking
[1:32:03] today where is that
[1:32:06] God I ask you in this
[1:32:09] morning where is God
[1:32:12] Church where is
[1:32:16] god brother says where is that
[1:32:20] God
[1:32:22] one that used to
[1:32:25] be where is that God of
[1:32:32] History sometimes I speak with people
[1:32:34] and I know they know more about history
[1:32:35] than I
[1:32:38] do but people don't want to know so much
[1:32:40] about that
[1:32:47] anymore if the god of History isn't the
[1:32:49] same God today
[1:32:57] what good does a god of History
[1:33:02] do what do we gain in speaking of God of
[1:33:06] History God of
[1:33:09] yesterday we don't gain
[1:33:15] anything the entire world knows Jesus
[1:33:18] came to Earth and
[1:33:20] died
[1:33:22] that's not so much good news anymore
[1:33:24] it's not anything new no
[1:33:29] church brother Bram says we're reading
[1:33:31] from brother
[1:33:37] brandham what happened to the great
[1:33:40] Jehovah look brother people are asking
[1:33:44] themselves where is that great Jehovah
[1:33:46] the
[1:33:49] Bible where's that Mighty God that
[1:33:53] where's that man that raised the
[1:33:59] dead where is that
[1:34:02] God that can change my
[1:34:06] [Music]
[1:34:10] situation the people are dying
[1:34:15] church and you are the only
[1:34:20] hope I'm The Only
[1:34:27] Hope see this strikes my
[1:34:33] heart because I believe every one of us
[1:34:36] one way or another have failed in this
[1:34:39] [Music]
[1:34:42] area I haven't been a good
[1:34:44] representative of
[1:34:47] Christ I haven't been a good ambassador
[1:34:50] of Christ
[1:34:56] but that's the only
[1:34:58] way that
[1:35:01] you that the people might see
[1:35:06] Jesus we're waiting for the coming of
[1:35:08] the Lord
[1:35:12] right people are waiting for a God to
[1:35:15] descend from
[1:35:17] heaven and come and change their
[1:35:20] situation
[1:35:23] and you
[1:35:28] have believe we have that answer that
[1:35:31] the world
[1:35:33] needs the answer continues being Jesus
[1:35:40] Christ he is the same yesterday today
[1:35:44] and
[1:35:45] forever I believe he doesn't
[1:35:47] change he doesn't change
[1:35:50] Church
[1:35:54] he continues being Jesus
[1:35:56] Christ continues
[1:35:59] raising restoring
[1:36:02] Souls continues
[1:36:04] restoring I tell you Church in this
[1:36:07] moment you are still
[1:36:10] doubting today can be your
[1:36:13] morning I want to tell you and encourage
[1:36:16] you sometimes we
[1:36:18] ourselves are

[1:36:29] change still deliver
[1:36:31] you resue

[1:36:42] need ask God for forgiv
[1:36:46] Lord the best representative you

[1:36:52] Soul maybe I can be that
[1:36:56] person can see God through
[1:37:00] me God people
[1:37:09] need what happened says brother
[1:37:16] brandham what has happened
[1:37:20] Church
[1:37:22] the world has come inside
[1:37:25] us that's what
[1:37:27] happened that's why we can't
[1:37:30] recognize the people don't recognize
[1:37:36] us and I don't want to be a hypocrite
[1:37:43] person I want to be honest with God and
[1:37:46] say
[1:37:48] God as Daniel said
[1:37:52] we've
[1:37:53] [Music]
[1:37:56] sinned Daniel was representing with his
[1:38:00] people and he said we've

[2:06:27] place God continues to
[2:06:31] work a special
[2:06:35] manner we're in crucial times
[2:06:39] Brothers I was meditating last
[2:06:43] night our science has been
[2:06:47] growing
[2:06:50] and people don't even want to go out and
[2:06:52] do their
[2:06:57] shopping I see how the trucks come
[2:07:00] delivering groceries to where I
[2:07:05] live I sh to my wife later on we're not
[2:07:07] going to want to go
[2:07:10] out but this is all part of
[2:07:17] this
[2:07:21] it's a privilege to be part of this
[2:07:23] history of the
[2:07:26] Lord Apostle Paul
[2:07:31] said he would have desired to be here to
[2:07:33] the end and be part of
[2:07:41] History we feel privileged to be here at
[2:07:44] the end of the
[2:07:47] story meditating as
[2:07:54] well I was thinking of
[2:08:00] Jonah he didn't want to go and preach
[2:08:02] out in
[2:08:07] N I can imagine him saying why they're
[2:08:11] not but he had to go through death and
[2:08:15] resurrection that
[2:08:17] Journey
[2:08:20] I believe many times
[2:08:28] we oh we don't even believe in or go
[2:08:31] there to save
[2:08:34] Souls but we have to pass through death
[2:08:36] and Resurrection as
[2:08:40] well the greatest victory that Sansom
[2:08:45] had I don't know how many he
[2:08:50] killed or how many women he
[2:08:54] had the greatest victory that he
[2:08:57] had was when he
[2:09:01] died when we died to our own ideas and
[2:09:05] beliefs and our own
[2:09:09] intelligence I believe that's when we'll
[2:09:11] have the greatest
[2:09:16] Victory brothers that's something I felt
[2:09:18] on of
[2:09:20] God I'm going to be giving the
[2:09:26] announcements let us continue praying
[2:09:28] for the pastor who's out in
[2:09:31] inan and the brothers that accompany
[2:09:34] [Music]
[2:09:36] him may God bring him back home
[2:09:43] safely and also on behalf of our sister
[2:09:45] TI and
[2:09:47] brother
