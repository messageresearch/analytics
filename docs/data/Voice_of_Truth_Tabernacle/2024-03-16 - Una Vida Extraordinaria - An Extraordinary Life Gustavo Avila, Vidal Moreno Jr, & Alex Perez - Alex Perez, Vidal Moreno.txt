Greater Works then these shall he do because I go unto the father say and Greater Works say it again Ander let us pray Heavenly Father we place ourselves in your hands tonight thanking you for one more chance to please you put aside our faults may we put aside our mistakes of today and may we just simply open up our hearts tonight believe that you have something that we need of right now use my brothers use my brothers and and may they be a blessing unto your people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you may take your seats the title of tonight's message with our brother VI and our brother Alex the extraordinary life tell your neighbor the extraordinary life because my Jesus your Jesus lived an extraordinary life the devil wants you to live ordinary the devil wants you to be common the devil wants me to be common my Jesus your Jesus put the extra in the ordinary he came to show me that I can also put the extra in this ordinary life that the devil wants me to live he wants us to be part of the multitude he doesn't want us to stand out he wants us to be like the common folks why do you want to stand out why do you want to live an extraordinary life my Jesus showed me why it's so important to give the extra the extra mile cuz that extra big or small makes the difference a millisecond makes a difference between a win giving that extra cuz my Jesus like I said the center of it all the perfect example of every Christian Life it's not impossible God Almighty made it he did it for you and me use an example today do you believe that church do you believe that Jesus Christ lived the life that you and I can live also I believe it I believe that he we can with the Holy Ghost amen amen you know thinking on this you know last Friday they preached on the wine A great miracle but this tonight we want to take it in the angle of of of the journey if we can say that our Jesus Christ went through from The Trial that he went through to get to this great this extraordinary life but in an extraordinary life is not built upon mediocrity I'm going to say it again in an extraordinary life is not based upon mediocrity how can you expect great things from something you don't put effort in you don't care enough about and thinking on this the God gave me the the the it came to mind when brother Brandon talks about when he talks about in the Jewish Traditions how they have an adoption ceremony you know how when the father adopts his son back and comparing this to our lord Jesus you know brother talks about it in the message hear ye him look it up and he talks about how this young man when he's born in a Jewish Family he is born with certain privileges not when he's born right away but later on but there is a process there is a journey that that young man has to go through to be able to obtain those privileges those blessings that his father has for him and the same thing our Lord Jesus Christ had to go through he went through exactly everything that you and I go through Tri that you go through he went through it every test he was tested he went through it and comparing it to this young man brother bham Compares when he's born he connects it to being born again are you with me Church don't be distracted with our brother Diego over here let us focus on tonight don't focus on me focus on God on God's word CU I'm going to fail you God words ain't going to fail you now brother B says in the message hear ye him like I said he Compares when the young man is born to the being born again and I believe we all want to be born again right one two okay people want to be born all right we all want to be born again amen but it's crazy to think that brother brandham says there's still more to that there's still more to that he says right here but because that you are born again that doesn't mean all of it all of it I'm getting to my point right here you just become a child you become become a member of the body of Christ but that doesn't mean that you're living in your privileges yet you're not living there yet and then our Prophet says and that's what's the matter with the with the people today what's wrong with the world they are living under the Privileges because they think that when they were born again that settled it oh Brothers just think about that picture that what if Jesus Christ just stopped right there when he was baptized when the Holy Spirit came down and the father said this is my son and who pleases me to dwell in what if you St there what if he didn't give the extra the extra that gave him that extraordinary life what about you what about me what if we don't give that extra that allows us to have access to those privileges come on now Church who want theives give the ex [Music] exra do what my body doesn't want to do against my human thinking human reasoning go the extra M body doesn't want you to do cu the devil like I said he wants you to be ordinary but my Jesus can help you get the extraordinary he says that only puts you in position for every Divine promise that God made right there in this being born again ain't it only now start to think this I put myself here when I thought this I know I'm not born again yet but if brother brandom says that doesn't settle it this puts me in in uh it scares me how much more I got to go and I think that I'm okay I think the way I am is okay right now my daily routine as a Christian is okay but thanks be to God that he sends his holy spirit to us comes in a still Small Voice so still that you may confuse it with your own voice and telling you that that's not it there's still more there's still more for you this Chill on your back is not it Friday Wednesday and Sunday is not [Applause] it you and the extra my our Pastor said it once he said it in a message the devil knows you preaching in 2019 he says I've said to the youth you think you're fine because you compare yourself to the rest and say well at least I'm not like her at least I'm not as terrible as him I'm not doing things that are that bad but he says but the reason why waiting for me to just simply give away to me how how is he going to give all his riches All His blessings if I don't take care of them if I don't care for them it's like our pastor said oh it's easy for us to let go of what God has given us you question why am I way I am why am I where I'm at it's because truly I recognize it I still haven't given that extra cuz my question is who wants to live a life without a purp you how you act the way you live does that identify you as a Son of God are you giving the extra I have to recognize it I Haven it lately I have it I want to give the extra tonight tonight this Friday night I give the extra allows me to enter basic in ordinary doesn't doesn't need much it just simply needs a humble heart recognizes that without him my life is pointless ordinary tonight God bless you God bless everyone uh if we could open our no I just I just love speaking about him uh it reads like this Matthew 4:1 17 for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and go ahead and Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two brothers Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishermen then he said to them follow me I will make you Fishers of Men they immediately left their Nets and followed him uh you know when we talk about Jesus uh you know we were talking about his temptation uh and uh you know um brother Marshall and brother uh Brother G did a great job last week you know I like the way they brought it amen uh but uh you know when uh we uh look at Jesus and you know the first thing that he does uh you know when he uh when he overcomes the Temptation amen uh you know the first thing he does is uh he he he speaks the word amen amen that's the way God does things amen you see the world the way the world was created was that God God spoke the word amen so when when Jesus overcomes Temptation he spoke the word you know when we look at at at what he did you know his first words were repent it just because the kingdom of of Heaven is at hand you see he never deviated from the Worden amen if you look at at the message that John the Baptist brought it was the same message that Jesus brought you see you see John John the Baptist was a prophet amen and and and Jesus and Jesus just said what the proph said you know and I think that's the that's the calling for our day because God doesn't change you see we should say of what the prophet said amen I believe that I don't know if you do but the Bible tells me that we should preach what the prophet preaches and that's exactly what Jesus did he just spoke the word you see when the we're here we're here to we're here to break heart hearts that's right oh you know we worry about you know healing them later amen we have a God that heals too because there's a lot of hearts that are hardened we have a God we have a God that that specialize in in breaking hearts tell my God's a heartbreaker amen amen I believe that I don't know if he's if he's broken your heart but you know when he breaks them you know he he strengthens them as well amen he does the same he does what he does amen amen I I I believe it 100% you know one of the things that brother Gustavo was talking [Music] about was you know that extraordinary life you know it's it's one of those things you know brother brandham says this you know he's talking about fathers and mothers he says and the father and mother he says it in he says it in the message come follow me he says praying constantly that their son would not turn out just an ordinary man that he'd be an extraordinary man all parents want that you see all the parents want that and then he says this in the next in a few paragraphs down and that's the ambition of every of any parent to do the best for their child that they can educate them or give them things maybe that they wasn't able to get and he says that's the way I feel about my children brother Brandon wanted the best for his children as well he didn't want him to be [Music] uneducated he wanted to get he wanted to give them the best that he could but one thing he didn't want is that he didn't want them to be ordinary you know and I I believe you know that that's what separates the son or daughter of God is that they weren't born to be average and they weren't born to be just common people I believe it 100% you see when I stopped believing the lies that the world told me there was a time in my life where I believed what the world told me I believed everything they said but you know when I when I when I listened when I heard God's word I realized it was all alive the Bible says let man's word be a lie and God's word be the truth and that's why we're here because the truth when it is received in the heart it has an effect not not just not just by hearing it but you know by bringing it to life but when it is quickened inside of something more than just make you have feel something it it stimulates it stimulates you to do something amen amen I believe you know uh and brother brandham says this actually he says it in the message uh preparation he says that the greatest miracle that God ever performed is when he took a sinner and made a Christian out of him that is the greatest miracle that there could ever be and and then he also says this if you want to see a miracle you need to become a miracle that's what he says you see and and and I'm just going to keep going now because time's advancing but when Jesus you know begins to preach his message you see he goes into a place that that is a very unique and odd he didn't stay home he didn't stay in Nazareth but he went into the darkest the places he went to ceram if I'm not mistaken and you know and there it says the people sat in darkness they were just sitting there in darkness it was something common for them to live that way and you know have you ever been around people they don't know anything about God they don't know anything about they have they have no perception or anything of of of what God is and you know you go into their home perhaps and it's just it's just a little bit odd to you because they don't understand of what the light actually is amen amen but Jesus goes into a place like this and he brings the light he he brings a revelation amen amen that's what that's what the Bible says but the thing that catches my attention is uh you know who he goes to he goes to some common folk he goes to some fishermen you know uh and and he catches them well he he they have they're they're in a net they have a net and uh you know they're two brothers Andrew and Peter and and and he also uh the other pair he goes to is uh um um the sons of zebede John and James and and but you know the thing of it is that they were fishermen you see so they they they handled Nets you know but I want to bring it to our time because I believe that there is Nets in our time as well the problem is H you've actually been caught up in the wrong net amen how many believe that we we live in a day where you know the biggest thing around is the internet and you know the thing of it is is that instead of you being caught by the gospel net you are caught up in the internet amen and the thing of it is you don't know how to get out amen amen that that is the truth you see you are so caught up in all of those things that there is no time for the gospel net how we have Netflix we have Hulu I don't have to name you know about them but the thing of it is is that you are trapped you are caught up in this net and you don't know how to get out but there is a way out amen amen and his name is Jesus that connection don't look for the internet connection look for The Jesus Connection he'll show you the way he'll bring you out these men living an ordinary life you know from one moment to the next their life was interrupted you know people don't like for their lives to be interrupted especially probably their social network life you know you try to take a phone away from them and you know you'll see what happens you know but the thing of it is is that you know you get so caught up in these things but what I what I what I can see here is that when we talk about this net is that God God he he actually wants people they know how to work the net now we got to work the right one and we are here uh because of the Gospel net amen amen you see and that's the net that is the that is the priority here see but but we see here that the lives of these men were disrupted and when we look at the when we look at the scripture here it says then he said to them in verse 19 follow me and I will make you Fishers of Men you see when he says that he's not asking them he he's telling them he's giving them a command he says that I will make you you see some of us here you know God wants to make you something he wants to make you more than a common person he wants to make you something bigger something greater he wants to make you and what you never thought you could be you see some of us here but we think we're selfmade we think that we're Sade that we own ourselves but but I believe that I was bought bought by the blood of Jesus and he owns me all of this it's his you see everything I have it is his verse 20 the Bible says they immediately left their Nets and followed him you see they immediately left no questions asked no doubts no reasoning but they just dropped the nest I tell you this you can drop your nest you can drop your addiction you can drop your sin drop your pornog drop your shame you can leave it all at the feet of Jesus you can leave it the question is will we leave it where will you leave it will you leave it in your truck when you come in church or will you leave it in your purse or will you leave it hidden so that you can come back to but what are you going to do what what you're dealing with you can finish it you can leave it this evening at the feet of Jesus what will we do with what we have right now brother Alex can come forward God huj someone say glory to God a teacher at a university of Stanford said I believe that Jesus was a good teacher good principle someone who could do great things I like the examples he brought I don't believe he's my I can't believe he died can't believe that he resurrected I believe he was a great philosoph brought great principles but that's where this evening that for he not only te he is not just a good man not over years he is my God my savior he is my everything is my resurrection he is my my healer I'm not talking about I'm not talking about thech the prophet the entire the entire Bible is I'm talking about your I'm talking about your savior I'm talking about is Jesus [Applause] Christ he is my Lord and I want to speak about him and I want to tell you I want to tell the world that there is no Lord Jesus Christ I want to tell you that he is my everything me life when I was deaded when I was dead he encourages when I'm discouraged when I have none words of encour when everyone else pushes me to the ground he is the one that can help he is the only he is the beginning he is the end he is the the Omega he is the same from yesterday he the same today my Jesus I come to speak of him today he is extraordinary he is like you or he is not like you although he was here and he walked as you walk he got tired like you he hungered like you but he's not like me he is more than that he is life Resurrection he is everything hallelujah hallelujah I come to speak of him to and I have the because he is my Lord and I love him I love I love him I come to speak of Jesus CH there no to express who he is he is that spoke to Abraham he seen his day he seen him in his day but now brother we're talking about Jesus Christ he is my friend when I have no friends he is my Advocate when when I need a when I don't have a solution he is my advocate he is my help he is my quick help when I need it when I can't find way he is my way when he's my bread when I'm he's my water when I'm thirsty he's Jesus [Applause] Christ River he had his vindication and he had his identification in the Jordan River in the desert he was tempted if what he had received was the truth and when he realized he realized who he was at the Jordan River experience at the Jord an experience to go down to the to go down into death be baptized not only be baptized by the water but to leave all of our past leave everything that we are we have a lot of us Christ had to leave everything aside his Ambitions he had in a child because he discovered his purpose his identification and I want to tell you that you're not you I'm not the only one you also have to discover who you are he is my everything he is my restoration when I don't find the way out I can run to him he is everything he is the everything of the Bible it was all the type and figure of what he is the the Ark of the Covenant the tents out in the desert the Tabernacle Hallelujah was all him Jesus Christ you need the baptism of the Holy Ghost for him to come andap the love of Jesus Christ has been lost that doesn't wake when when you don't hear when hear the of Jesus Christ we need a baptized like John it's so common to us we're a common people we're accustomed to hearing the voice of Jesus he's not just a man he is power he is Authority he represents more than a man he is everything he is my life get out of get out of your Z of just coming to hear Jesus he can change your life he can transform he can raise you up a lot of you aren't excit because you need something to live inside of you when John heard the name for the first time it says that it says that he was dead brother says that he was dead he was dead there was no life in him but when he heard the name of [Applause] Jesus there's something about when you hear the name of Jesus something has to when you hear the name of power Resurrection he can transform you this morning we live such common lives so normal another Friday it's just another Friday I'm not going to wear my favorite because it's Friday that's for Sunday what if God has something for you today but if what God wants to change you today what if God has your miracle today and you're not coming with the right attitude Jesus he's good for Wednesday it's good for Friday he can do things on Saturday he can restore you Sunday on Monday when you're falling he can raise you up there are no limits it can be a Monday and you could be rejoicing with your God can be a Tuesday and you're in a Revival with your God don't tell me that it's just on Sundays right Jesus is my God he is my everything he can restore your you your life he can he can change your life you those emotions those things that happen in that no one realizes there is someone that can help you there someone that can change that takes away that evil desire from your life that takes away that desire that when you're living in sin when you look at sin you hate it you hate it because he's now taking that desire from you can see common things and you say this isn't for me Jesus L the higher for Life Jesus L the higher life no one could understand no one understood it his parents didn't understand his brothers didn't understand the priest didn't understand it but you know what he had the purpose to do the the purpose ofat the man young lady brother when we realize who our father is when you realize that you're not here to please the whole world come many come to please the world what good is you for you to please the world and lose your soul look if someone like to please people I I don't like to have enemies you know I realized that I need enemies I need people that they they're not in agreement I I need people to say he's different that's right that's how Jesus he said what was white white what was black black he said it how it was right but the extraordinary people aren't that way an extra an extraordinary person brother M they can't confront they have principles in their lives they have laws in their life and or more they can't break under any circumstances listen I like to see people that are disciplined people with purpose have you ever ran into that when you serve them a plate they don't eat it because it does it does them harm wow what discipline I would have already eaten it devoured it look the world knows the devil knows us better than you do oh no brother yes yes he he's done this longer than you and I am he knows that if he just presents something to us and we just we fold over come on now that is common people that is normal you and I are not like you were called to be a normal person you are normal people you are abnormal exrain Extraordinary People there's a word that I'm learning B bound boundaries boundar boundaries boundaries boundaries boundaries boundaries boundaries boundaries perimeters parameters do you have boundaries in your life that if a friend tells you if they extend something to you can you say no no I don't want that was Jesus he didn't break certain boundaries in his life he couldn't he had to please his he came with a purpose heed his there at at the Jordan goal of his life that was Jesus and we from a bowl of lentils we give our life over and then we ask ourselves why we're so miserable in church and in our Christian Life it's time to surrender ourselves to him it's time to say you know what I'm just going to be frank with myself I need of you I need of what you have what you have that was in Jesus can be in [Applause] you extraordinary people and I'm I'm preaching to myself here they live differently they act differently young lady don't just wear the skirt just because your parents tell you to H the Lord give me understanding and revelation of why I'm doing it don't just look dress nice here and be out there with shorts ask of Revelation I don't
