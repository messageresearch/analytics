[35:02] [Applause]
[35:06] [Music]
[35:16] [Music]
[35:25] amen if you can open your scriptures
[35:27] with me
[35:30] to the book of exodus chapter 12
[35:35] verse 31
[35:40] you can say amen when you have it
[35:53] and he called for moses
[35:55] and aaron by night and said rise up and
[35:58] get you forth from among my people
[36:01] both ye and the children of israel and
[36:04] go serve the lord as you have said
[36:08] e is
[36:24] we'll go ahead and jump down to verse
[36:26] 35.
[36:30] it says like this dc i see and the
[36:33] children of israel did according to the
[36:35] word of moses and they borrowed of the
[36:37] egyptians jews of silver angels of gold
[36:40] and raymond
[37:05] we just want to give you thanks for now
[37:06] allowing us another opportunity to be
[37:08] able to be in your house
[37:14] it's uh it's always a privilege to be
[37:15] here lord
[37:18] and today we just ask you to speak to us
[37:48] the title
[38:08] and that ties in perfectly here with the
[38:10] situation we just read about
[38:15] you see that that fur it's estimated
[38:18] that for 215 years
[38:25] the israelites were enslaved to the
[38:27] egyptians amen
[38:44] would have wanted an old i would have
[38:46] wanted to know the why man
[38:49] i would have wanted to know why i was in
[38:51] bondage for such a long time
[38:59] when god had promised my ancestors i
[39:01] would i would be an owner of a land amen
[39:09] and this this wasn't a part of the
[39:10] promise yes
[39:24] that although you you might be in
[39:26] bondage today
[39:40] because if you're a child
[39:54] god frees you
[40:05] many people say that god will take you
[40:07] as you are
[40:17] but just because god takes you as you
[40:19] are it doesn't mean he wants to leave
[40:20] you that way
[40:36] you see that they
[41:02] amen it came to a point to where the the
[41:05] world brothers the the magicians
[41:11] it came to the point that god had to
[41:12] divide between his true children and
[41:14] those that that were just pretenders
[41:16] amen
[41:33] and it's going to come to the point
[41:34] where the world is going to have to say
[41:39] that this is none other than the finger
[41:41] of god amen
[41:44] amen that's what brother brown says that
[41:46] faith is
[41:55] is the only only explanation you have
[41:57] for the situation is
[42:06] amen how many believe we are living in a
[42:08] greater age
[42:12] amen it's a greater age es
[42:14] because it's
[42:24] and it's uh it's a lot harder to believe
[42:25] because we don't see it yes
[42:28] difficult
[43:15] amen i believe that was just god paying
[43:17] his people for what they'd went through
[43:23] but it was also god it was also god
[43:25] preparing them for the next thing
[43:31] you see because they were going to need
[43:33] strength to build
[43:38] they were going to need
[44:05] to show us that he's making
[44:11] god is giving us things that money can't
[44:12] buy amen
[44:16] all of all of the all of of what we have
[44:19] brothers
[44:30] all of that is going towards building a
[44:32] better tabernacle
[44:38] because you know what they did you know
[44:39] what the israelites did with the with
[44:40] the goal that they received
[44:47] they used it to build a tabernacle
[45:01] a more perfect tabernacle
[45:12] we spoke about how how the israelites
[45:14] were were enslaved for 215 years
[45:44] that was an urgency there brothers
[45:48] and that's that's an urgency is
[45:49] something that demands your attention
[45:54] there was no time to be packed
[45:58] they couldn't
[46:01] they couldn't go and get their maletas
[46:03] and pack all their belongings
[46:07] they had to go brothers
[46:10] and there wasn't time to pack pride amen
[46:25] there wasn't time to be lazy
[46:29] hey man brothers your brother couldn't
[46:30] be packing you you have to go yourself
[46:34] your brother couldn't have to be packing
[46:36] your brother couldn't carry you you have
[46:37] to go yourself
[46:42] and then in today's in today's day
[46:47] there's no urgency
[46:50] there's no urgency because we don't see
[46:52] it
[47:07] did we do it on our own
[47:17] amen amen and many of the people they
[47:20] took egypt with him
[47:30] some of them just wanted the blessing of
[47:31] being able to leave that lifestyle
[48:03] inside into that
[48:26] amen
[48:29] amen
[48:30] when uh when pharaoh when moses
[48:32] approached pharaoh
[48:37] moses asked him
[48:40] and by this time the plagues had
[48:42] happened
[48:45] and each time that the place happens
[48:50] moses would ask pharaoh
[48:53] you would say to him
[48:55] you would say when when when do you want
[48:57] this place to be gone
[49:14] the
[49:23] amen when do you when do you guys want
[49:25] sin to leave your lives
[49:42] you want it today
[49:56] thing that's that's super
[49:58] that stands out a lot
[50:01] is that god let pharaoh choose the time
[50:03] that he wanted the place to leave
[50:33] amen amen hallelujah hallelujah
[50:38] ah god is good amen
[50:41] amen it's good
[50:43] amen everything that all of the trials
[50:45] that the people of israel went through
[50:51] it gave them enough to make it through
[50:53] les dios sufficiente para poder pasar
[50:56] and uh that's something that we don't
[50:58] understand sometimes
[51:01] that god gives us exactly what we need
[52:30] because god i believe that god is a god
[52:32] of of of partying amen
[52:40] and he just wants us to go through it
[52:44] but there's no
[52:54] that's all i have brothers
[52:59] [Applause]
[53:12] first of all
[53:14] i'd like to greet our brother edgar
[53:17] his wife sister
[53:19] and they're both sons brian
[53:21] and brandon god bless them greatly
[53:25] i was able to meet them yesterday
[53:30] they told me they drove 72 hours here
[53:32] you go wow and i said wow
[53:36] i live two minutes here
[53:38] yes
[53:39] and it's just anything for me
[53:47] learn a little of what our brother did
[53:49] the panel
[53:50] from so far
[53:54] knowing where the life is
[53:56] and to obtain that life
[53:59] god bless
[54:01] honor privilege to have you with us
[54:04] in english and i'll be switching to
[54:06] english hey man it's been a while now
[54:11] [Music]
[54:20] quickly like to go to exodus chapter 14.
[54:34] speaking unto the children of israel
[54:36] that they turn and encamp before
[54:39] haharaf between mcdowell and the sea
[54:43] over against balsa fong before it shall
[54:45] yi encamp by the sea dialogues
[54:59] of the children of israel
[55:01] they are entangled in the land the
[55:03] wilderness has shut them in
[55:16] and i will be honored upon pharaoh
[55:19] glorification
[55:20] upon all his hosts
[55:23] and that the egyptians may know that i
[55:25] am the lord
[55:29] and they did also
[55:31] may god add blessing to
[55:44] that god is leading the people of israel
[56:42] god understand god fully
[56:45] because if we try to understand how god
[56:47] works
[56:51] would go completely insane
[56:54] because god cannot be put
[57:24] for who hath known the mind of the lord
[57:29] that he may instruct him
[57:32] a question
[57:35] on the face of the earth
[57:37] and tell god what to do
[58:20] but i simply believe
[59:02] a greater purpose
[59:06] a greater purpose in themselves
[59:08] and young people
[59:11] i myself put myself there
[59:14] closed-minded
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:38] is that not enough
[1:00:54] is
[1:01:08] way gondolone commander
[1:01:11] was going back to egypt
[1:01:14] that's what the devil wants to make you
[1:01:15] think but
[1:01:18] again
[1:01:20] we could stay in that constant mindset
[1:02:05] if he questioned him throughout the
[1:02:06] whole process
[1:02:08] he would have kept on questioning him
[1:02:10] throughout the whole thing
[1:02:14] that's every young person every adult
[1:02:16] yes
[1:02:17] it happens has
[1:03:12] and this is a hard question
[1:03:43] he completely forgot himself
[1:03:47] forgot his whole mindset
[1:03:50] mentality and that's what god wants from
[1:03:52] each other
[1:03:55] that's the only way he can work through
[1:03:56] it
[1:04:09] let's go to what our prophet says
[1:04:28] you've got to forget all you've ever
[1:04:30] known in your own knowledge to know
[1:04:33] christ
[1:04:52] to apply
[1:05:04] you just come childlike and accept
[1:05:20] more humble
[1:05:34] and believe it
[1:05:36] and by faith es
[1:05:39] these things are common questions
[1:05:42] and then look what the prophet says is
[1:05:44] professional very important it's more
[1:05:45] important not what you no longer
[1:05:48] can't
[1:06:02] by
[1:07:09] to be as a little boy
[1:07:11] nino i i didn't know anything else
[1:07:14] that's what my dad told me
[1:07:17] christ didn't know anything else
[1:07:20] to a certain point until what the father
[1:07:22] revealed
[1:07:25] and moses didn't know anything at all
[1:07:28] but to the moment hasta momento where
[1:07:30] god brought him to you
[1:07:33] and he simply had to act
[1:07:36] he simply said
[1:07:38] take that
[1:07:39] in your hands
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:09:32] talking to
[1:10:43] [Music]
[1:10:56] egypt was done
[1:11:51] i am with you your story
[1:12:20] amen
[1:12:30] lord jesus christ
[1:12:32] amen
[1:12:39] [Music]
[1:13:03] 14 verse 3
[1:13:05] 13.
[1:13:11] exodus 14 13.
[1:13:16] can you stand with me brother
[1:13:36] and moses said unto the people fear ye
[1:13:38] not stand still and see the salvation of
[1:13:40] the lord which he will shoot to you to
[1:13:43] you today for the egyptians whom ye have
[1:13:45] seen today ye shall see them again no
[1:13:48] more
[1:13:48] no more forever
[1:13:56] the lord shall shall fight for you and
[1:13:58] you shall hold your peace
[1:14:07] israel
[1:14:09] and the lord said unto moses wherefore
[1:14:11] christ down to me speak unto the
[1:14:12] children of israel that he go forward
[1:14:27] but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out
[1:14:29] thine hand over the sea and divide it
[1:14:30] and the children of israel shall go on
[1:14:32] the dry ground through the midst of the
[1:14:33] sea
[1:14:37] seated brother
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:54] jericho
[1:15:21] the people of israel
[1:15:38] and the bible says that the lord
[1:15:40] hardened pharaoh's heart
[1:15:46] israel to go and persecute the people of
[1:15:48] israel
