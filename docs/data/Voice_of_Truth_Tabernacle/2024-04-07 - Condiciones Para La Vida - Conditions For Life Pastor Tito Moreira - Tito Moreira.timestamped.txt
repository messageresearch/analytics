[6:40] my head I said I don't understand
[6:42] this and these young women throwing
[6:44] their arms around
[6:48] me now I do realize this is a mixed
[6:53] audience and I say this with the
[6:55] sweetness and the mellowness of the
[6:58] spirit
[7:00] men cannot put your arm around women
[7:02] without a human
[7:04] sensation but it wasn't
[7:07] there there was no yesterday no
[7:09] tomorrow they didn't get married or
[7:15] tired I never seen such pretty women in
[7:17] all my
[7:19] life they had their way down to their
[7:22] way their had their Hairway down to
[7:24] their waistline long skirts to their
[7:27] feet and they were just just a hugging
[7:33] me as you see brother Brown begins to
[7:35] speak about this
[7:39] place I take it like the perfect
[7:42] place the perfect
[7:50] atmosphere but Brown says there was no
[7:52] weariness pain or anything of
[7:58] this
[8:00] and I begin to see this like something
[8:02] letting me
[8:03] know there was life
[8:06] here the life of the Lord Jesus Christ
[8:09] was
[8:10] there there was no
[8:13] religion there was the life of
[8:17] God
[8:18] why what conditions were
[8:25] there we see the prophet is describing
[8:28] these women
[8:30] look many many times women don't
[8:36] notice how much of what they do means to
[8:39] the Holy
[8:42] Spirit they don't
[8:44] notice that trimming your
[8:48] hair dressing
[8:51] indecently are conditions for death and
[8:55] not conditions for
[8:58] life
[9:00] people would
[9:01] say the temperature must be
[9:04] exact details
[9:09] matter if you bring your body
[9:11] temperature down two
[9:15] degrees if you drop it from 95 and
[9:18] below your body begins to
[9:21] die your body cannot sustain
[9:26] life your body is always fighting to
[9:28] keep the right
[9:31] temperature because they know it needs
[9:33] that
[9:35] temperature to keep
[9:37] life so that life does not
[9:42] Escape it's time we notice that life is
[9:44] escaping from us I'm not speaking about
[9:47] natural life but the spiritual life you
[9:50] should say do I really have God's life
[9:53] in
[9:55] me you should ask yourself why is the
[9:57] life escaping from me have you ever F
[9:59] you're dying spiritually dying come on
[10:04] church it's time we realize
[10:08] why what conditions are around
[10:12] us you think trimming your hair and
[10:15] dressing indecently doesn't
[10:18] matter it might not matter to
[10:22] somebody but they are part of God's
[10:25] laws you say how do you know that
[10:27] brother Titus because I see it here in
[10:33] heaven they all had long
[10:37] hair they all were dressed
[10:41] appropriately the conditions what was
[10:45] needed people make these things
[10:48] less like if they don't
[10:52] matter but let me tell if certain
[10:54] conditions conditions are not in their
[10:56] place life cannot come
[11:03] you say God doesn't care about what I
[11:05] watch What atmosphere do you have around
[11:08] you God forgives you God forgives
[11:14] you not only did God give us conditions
[11:16] for
[11:19] life God provided us a way to make it to
[11:22] those
[11:23] conditions I don't know if you
[11:25] understand what I'm
[11:28] saying
[11:29] he himself says I will carry you there I
[11:33] can wash you I can fix
[11:36] you I can help you so the life can come
[11:41] in you but we don't want
[11:44] to we don't let
[11:47] him
[11:49] Brethren I don't know if this hurts us
[11:51] or if it's making us fall
[11:55] asleep but this hurts
[11:58] me cuz
[12:00] I find out if I want the Holy
[12:02] Spirit if I want God's true
[12:07] life I need the correct conditions
[12:10] around my
[12:13] life you say why does all that
[12:18] matter because it matters to God that
[12:21] you're
[12:23] genuine to wear makeup dress a certain
[12:28] way
[12:34] God wants the beauty from the inside of
[12:35] you come out not the beauty of this
[12:39] world everything that women wear
[12:41] today are worldly things the world has
[12:45] created them that was not
[12:50] God God wants
[12:52] sincereness God wants
[12:55] honesty God doesn't want something fake
[12:57] over you
[12:59] That Matters to the Holy
[13:04] Spirit they are conditions for
[13:12] life now I'm speaking as a church when a
[13:16] woman because a woman represents the
[13:20] church when a
[13:24] church is woring more to please the
[13:27] people out there to and press programs
[13:30] everything else there cannot be life
[13:34] there that's why God left the
[13:37] organizations there can't be life there
[13:40] brother brandom says
[13:43] as as soon as a church
[13:47] organizes death comes in and life
[13:51] leaves life can't dwell
[13:58] there say Lord forgive
[14:02] us maybe we haven't created the right
[14:06] atmosphere we come to church like a
[14:10] religion brother we don't come with a
[14:13] Thanksgiving we don't come with the
[14:15] right
[14:16] motives oh Hallelujah
[14:18] Lord no wonder the Holy Ghost can't pour
[14:23] himself no wonder they can't be new
[14:28] births
[14:37] brother brandham says this at the
[14:52] end and I Heard a Voice then that spoke
[14:55] to me that was in the room said this is
[14:57] what you preach was the Holy Ghost this
[14:59] is perfect love and nothing can enter
[15:01] here without
[15:03] it I see
[15:06] then the main
[15:09] condition is not the only
[15:13] one but the main condition that should
[15:16] exist you understand what I mean when I
[15:19] say condition
[15:22] right I'm speaking about a certain
[15:25] atmosphere that needs to
[15:27] form
[15:29] talking about certain
[15:32] requirements things that must be in
[15:35] order the first one is divine
[15:39] love just like there's a sun for
[15:43] Earth just like the sun needs to
[15:45] shine without the sun there's no
[15:48] [Music]
[15:50] life if there ain't a sun nothing can be
[15:53] born that's the first thing God said let
[15:57] there be light and there was light
[16:01] and brother says and the clouds were
[16:03] separated and the sun
[16:05] shined and
[16:09] began to produce life from these seeds
[16:14] Brethren without love there is no
[16:18] life I'll repeat it without love there
[16:22] is no
[16:26] life forgive me
[16:29] you can be the best religious
[16:33] person know the message but without
[16:38] love you continue being a
[16:47] grave the first condition for life is
[16:53] love the most important that should
[16:55] exist for Life Is
[16:57] Love
[16:59] Brethren and what are we
[17:02] doing we judge
[17:06] criticize
[17:08] gossip and
[17:12] block the love that should be between
[17:16] us how can the Holy Spirit move oh
[17:21] Church how can the holy spirit
[17:25] moves when the right love between us is
[17:28] missing
[17:30] I'll tell you one more
[17:32] time if the conditions aren't
[17:36] there you won't be in the
[17:39] resurrection there will never be life in
[17:44] you what you have right now ain't life
[17:46] it's
[17:47] death it's a
[17:50] life that little by little is
[17:54] fading like a
[17:57] body that cannot maintain
[18:00] life maybe it's bleeding
[18:03] out you have an ill
[18:05] body a cancerous
[18:08] body a bleeding out body you can call it
[18:12] life but it's
[18:14] dying the life is leaving little by
[18:18] little that's what we have today don't
[18:21] call this life we are dying by the
[18:27] minute life that was once in the Garden
[18:30] of
[18:31] Eden little by little has been leaving
[18:35] and has produced
[18:37] sickness sin everything
[18:39] else and
[18:41] urgently we
[18:44] need to return to the right
[18:48] conditions for life to come inside
[18:53] us God is giving us an
[18:55] opportunity oh Church God's giving you
[18:58] an opportunity
[19:00] Christian God's giving you an
[19:02] opportunity for New Life to come in
[19:05] you before you completely
[19:13] die God says I'm giving you a
[19:16] chance before death takes
[19:19] you before there's no solution for you
[19:23] I'm giving you an
[19:25] opportunity for life to come again in
[19:28] you
[19:29] the life Adam
[19:31] had the life the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:37] had the life that was here in this sixth
[19:44] Dimension we need the correct
[19:48] conditions we need the correct
[19:50] atmosphere are you with
[19:52] me those that are farmers in agriculture
[19:56] you know you cannot s out of before time
[19:59] because they die won't produce
[20:03] anything when it's you need to know when
[20:05] the right time for producing is you need
[20:07] to se when the time is
[20:10] right for so life can come
[20:13] out and when the conditions are in place
[20:17] life comes life is
[20:23] produced one more
[20:25] time that's why God sent us a
[20:27] message to prepare a
[20:30] bride so she could have the correct
[20:34] womb just like the spirit Mary
[20:37] had
[20:40] behold behold your
[20:42] servants let it be done according to thy
[20:46] will it wasn't the natural God
[20:49] wanted God wanted the spiritual
[20:55] Mary he wanted the correct had the
[20:58] correct Spirit she
[21:00] had she had the right
[21:04] atmosphere she had the right
[21:09] atmosphere had the correct
[21:13] word and God sent us the correct word I
[21:17] believe this message has
[21:19] come to give us the right atmosphere the
[21:22] right
[21:23] conditions for the life of the Lord
[21:25] Jesus
[21:27] Christ could come one more
[21:35] time but
[21:36] uh to produce
[21:40] life you need the egg and
[21:46] sperm you need male and female are with
[21:52] me and this time God sent us the
[21:54] Original
[21:57] Seed need a bride in the correct
[22:00] atmosphere that has a correct
[22:03] womb to
[22:05] produce what he sent in our
[22:08] time what will it
[22:11] produce it will produce the
[22:13] Resurrection The Rapture will produce
[22:17] the coming of the
[22:18] Lord when the
[22:21] conditions in The Bride of the Lord
[22:23] Jesus
[22:24] Christ are how they should
[22:27] be
[22:31] don't wait for the world to
[22:32] improve the world will get
[22:36] worse when Sarah gave birth to the
[22:39] promised
[22:40] son God was about to destroy Sodom
[22:44] and but they were
[22:46] ready they were
[22:49] ready to produce the promised
[22:54] son don't wait for the world to get
[22:57] better need to be in the right
[23:05] atmosphere we need the original
[23:18] faith can speak about all the things
[23:21] this message
[23:27] did of things it did it turned the bride
[23:30] the
[23:31] church returned
[23:33] her to her young
[23:38] State returned her to her original state
[23:40] to her original
[23:42] Faith that's what this message
[23:46] did before we could produce the Lord
[23:48] Jesus
[23:52] Christ he had to return this bride to
[23:54] his original love to its original faith
[23:59] it's his original
[24:03] Revelation what did it do it rejuvenated
[24:06] of the Lord Jesus
[24:08] Christ so her womb could be
[24:11] ready brother I don't know if you
[24:13] understand what I'm telling
[24:17] you Sarah's womb had to be
[24:21] ready couldn't produce it in that
[24:24] condition God had to change her and in
[24:28] this
[24:28] time God has to change the
[24:32] bride to her original Faith to her
[24:36] original fa so her
[24:39] womb could receive God's
[24:50] word he took us to the original
[24:55] Faith his
[24:57] faith or your faith is not
[25:01] enough it has to be the original
[25:04] Faith I'll repeat it your faith is not
[25:07] enough to produce
[25:09] life you need the original
[25:20] Faith Brom tells in the message only
[25:26] believe talking about gyus
[25:38] is he says that gyrus was a secret
[25:57] believer and there he was you know out
[25:59] there and believing then come home by
[26:02] little candle light and study though the
[26:04] through the night when he'd go to one of
[26:06] those
[26:14] meetings maybe disguised himself and put
[26:17] a veil over his face or something so he
[26:19] wouldn't be known as Dr
[26:24] gyrus you know he wouldn't want to be
[26:26] known amongst the crowd
[26:30] but yeah he was sitting
[26:32] there he's telling that
[26:38] gyrus this man maybe wore a
[26:41] disguise put a hat on or something a
[26:45] scarf and he would attend the Lord's
[26:48] meetings he would sit way back
[26:52] there and would write
[26:55] notes but he didn't want them to to know
[26:58] he was
[27:02] there and he watched this and he studied
[27:13] it but yeah he couldn't openly publicly
[27:16] confess him because he'd have to give up
[27:18] his Ministerial Association and his
[27:20] fellowship with his
[27:27] brethren
[27:35] well you know God's got a way of
[27:37] bringing that real genuine Faith out in
[27:39] us oh hallelujah hallelujah
[27:43] Brethren brother
[27:46] BR and so his little girl got
[27:49] ill what was God
[27:53] doing he was setting the
[27:57] correct
[27:59] to bring out gyrus genuine
[28:01] Fai he had a mediocre
[28:06] fath a faith of a secret
[28:09] believer I ask myself I ask myself how
[28:13] many of
[28:15] us have a halfway Faith with
[28:19] God we have a halfway Faith with God but
[28:23] God
[28:24] knows how to bring it
[28:27] out from
[28:29] us all of a sudden his
[28:32] daughter it was not a
[28:35] coincidence was not a coincidence it was
[28:38] God working in his
[28:40] son to bring out the genuine Faith out
[28:43] of
[28:45] him he had no other
[28:48] option he had no other
[28:52] option when he found out his daughter
[28:54] was dying listen
[28:57] brethren
[28:59] when he noticed or realized his daughter
[29:01] was
[29:02] dying that's our
[29:04] problem we don't realize we're
[29:10] dying we haven't
[29:13] realized because we're in church we
[29:15] think we're
[29:17] fine watch what prophet saying on
[29:27] gyrus
[29:35] brother Brown says after he met with his
[29:36] religious friends and they told him they
[29:38] said remember if you go you know what's
[29:40] going to happen you know our
[29:45] declaration yes I understand all about
[29:47] it but I've got a dying child
[29:53] here and the very thing that I've hid in
[29:55] my heart all the
[29:57] time I've searched the
[30:00] scriptures I've attended to his meetings
[30:02] under
[30:04] disguised and I've checked the
[30:07] scriptures and he is the
[30:09] Messiah amen that's it amen that's the
[30:14] way you're coming to it
[30:18] Jus come right out and tell them what's
[30:20] right confess your
[30:23] Fai church we need to confess our faith
[30:26] which faith
[30:28] the faith God sent
[30:30] us a
[30:32] prophet it's time to stand for
[30:48] it oh he said the truth said now you
[30:50] remember if you do well what's going to
[30:52] happen but jyrus had a
[30:55] need and brother if there was a time
[31:00] that we ought to make our
[31:02] confession that he is the Messiah the
[31:05] Son of God that he is
[31:08] alive that his power is just the
[31:11] same there's a need today today is the
[31:15] hour people are
[31:18] dying people are dying in
[31:24] churches
[31:26] ohos oh brother
[31:32] there might not be a pain in you till
[31:34] it's your son or
[31:36] daughter maybe until it's your your own
[31:39] self
[31:41] soul and you realize my soul is
[31:45] dying I need of the
[31:49] life maybe that's why we haven't
[31:53] hurried we haven't
[31:56] interested and we have that's why we
[31:59] haven't taken this message
[32:00] serious because we haven't
[32:04] realized that we might be dying
[32:08] spiritually we might not be in the
[32:12] resurrection your all your religion
[32:14] might not save
[32:16] you all your Creeds might not save
[32:19] you Church time to
[32:22] recog if there's no life in us if the
[32:26] right love is in if the correct faith is

[32:40] there people are dying in
[32:44] churches the Pentecostal church is
[32:47] dying it's going so

[33:00] dying let's get back to
[33:02] God it's right
[33:05] now because there's a
[33:09] need come back to the faith that was

[33:14] Saints that's the faith that produces
[33:16] the
