[18:32] Jonah chapter 4
[18:36] says verse
[18:41] [Music]
[18:43] one but it displeased Jonah exceedingly
[18:46] and he was very
[18:57] angry
[19:10] and he prayed unto the Lord and said I
[19:12] pray thee Oh Lord was not this my saying
[19:14] when I was yet in my country therefore I
[19:17] fled before unto tares for I knew that
[19:19] thou are a gracious God and merciful
[19:21] slow to anger and our great kindness and
[19:24] repentance thee of the
[19:27] evil
[19:32] therefore now Lord take I beseech thee
[19:35] my life from me for it is better me to
[19:37] die than to
[19:41] live then said the Lord doest thou well
[19:44] to be
[19:49] angry uh Jonah had a high temper very
[19:57] angry
[20:07] so Jonah went out of the city and sat on
[20:09] the east side of the city and there made
[20:11] him a booth and sat under it in the
[20:13] shadow till he might see what would
[20:15] become of the
[20:27] city
[20:29] and the Lord God prepared a gourd and it
[20:31] made it come up over Jonah that it might
[20:33] be a shadow over his head to deliver him
[20:35] from his grief so Jonah was exceeding
[20:38] glad of the
[20:46] gourd but God prepared a warm when the
[20:48] morning Rose the next day and it smoke
[20:50] the gour that it
[20:57] withered
[21:05] and it came to pass when the sun did
[21:07] arise that God prepared a vemon East
[21:09] Wind and the Sun Beat upon the head of
[21:12] Jonah that he fainted and wished himself
[21:13] to die and said it is better for me to
[21:15] die than to
[21:24] live and God said to Jonah doest thou
[21:27] well to be angry for the gourd and he
[21:29] said I do well to be angry even unto
[21:43] death then said the Lord thou Hast had
[21:46] pity on the gourd for that which thou
[21:48] Hast not labored neither mest It Grow
[21:51] which came up in a night and perish in a
[21:57] night
[22:07] anales and should not I spare Nineveh
[22:09] that great City where are wherein are
[22:11] more than six score thousand persons
[22:13] that cannot discern between their right
[22:15] hand and left hand and also much
[22:18] cattle let us pray Heavenly
[22:22] Father we give you thanks
[22:25] Lord for one more opportunity you give
[22:27] us
[22:29] come to your Holy Temple Lord and
[22:31] worship
[22:32] you that's what we were made
[22:35] for that's what you made us for
[22:37] Lord to come and worship you
[22:40] Lord not just here in church but

[23:03] hot people that give everything for
[23:06] you in this morning
[23:09] Lord to show you how much we love
[23:12] you while we hear your
[23:14] word may our hearts be open to your
[23:17] voice
[23:20] Lord our spiritual ears be open to hear
[23:24] you
[23:25] Lord and
[23:26] answer true
[23:35] worship our God is still
[23:37] alive that our God is still
[23:40] real that our God is in our
[23:43] midst that we don't serve a dead
[23:46] God we serve a present God a god of
[23:50] today a god
[23:52] of a God of this
[23:56] moment in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[24:00] amen you may be
[24:03] seated we send greetings to our brothers
[24:05] in that are watching us may the Lord
[24:08] bless
[24:09] them and God bless you
[24:12] here Vicki and her
[24:15] family anyone else watching
[24:17] worldwide we're happy to be here
[24:22] brother I'm happy to be in the house of
[24:24] the
[24:26] Lord
[24:29] the subject we are taking on is on the
[24:31] second coming of the Lord Jesus
[24:34] Christ and we've been speaking on the
[24:39] resurrection and we've taken the Book of
[24:43] Jonah so learn more about death and
[24:47] Resurrection because Jesus himself did
[24:51] it Jesus himself took Jonah's
[24:55] story talk about his own death and
[24:59] Resurrection he said just as
[25:04] Jonah was in the belly of the well for
[25:07] three days and three
[25:09] nights so shall the son of
[25:12] man be in the heart of the
[25:14] earth three days and three
[25:18] nights so God
[25:20] took the story of
[25:24] Jonah to tell us more of the
[25:26] Resurrection
[25:32] it's not easy to bring a lesson from
[25:34] Jonah's
[25:36] life Jonah was a very odd
[25:41] character but I believe in the odd is
[25:44] where God
[25:46] is where the strange things are that's
[25:48] where God
[25:49] is because God is a stranger God and
[25:54] God's children are
[25:56] odd although you don't believe it you
[25:59] are an
[26:02] oddball Oddball believing this
[26:06] message coming to
[26:08] church on in the
[26:11] weekend when you could do other things
[26:14] we're
[26:15] oddballs and his children are
[26:18] oddballs and Jonah is an
[26:22] oddball I see a very odd
[26:26] man
[26:29] at the same time I see a very angered
[26:31] and frustrated
[26:32] man the Bible
[26:34] says that in the latter
[26:39] days this is second Timothy chapter 3
[26:43] and verse
[26:49] two and the latter day says for men
[26:52] shall be lovers of their own
[26:54] selves CET boers
[27:00] proud disobedient parents unth thanful
[27:06] Unholy without natural
[27:09] affection says truth
[27:11] Breakers false
[27:15] accusers then it also uses this word
[27:18] also
[27:21] incontinent says
[27:24] Fierce despisers of those that are good
[27:30] when I read these things I
[27:33] notice this
[27:35] age these latter
[27:38] days would be a
[27:44] generation that was would be
[27:49] frustrated an angry
[27:54] generation and truly we're living in
[27:56] that time
[28:03] we see everyone unsatisfied angry and
[28:08] frustrated we are a generation that's
[28:13] unsatisfied I see Jonah and I see him
[28:18] unsatisfied I see him very bothered
[28:25] frustrated I see him as a man that was
[28:28] not
[28:32] happy I think it represents our
[28:35] time of our
[28:38] age an unsatisfied
[28:42] generation unsatisfied
[28:47] marriages unsatisfied parents with their
[28:56] children bothered with our sisters with
[28:58] our
[28:59] brothers don't tell me it's
[29:03] not as a pastor I see
[29:07] it people seem as time goes by
[29:10] more the more Angry we
[29:13] get anything gets us
[29:16] angry anything bothers
[29:22] us anything makes us look like we're
[29:25] fired up with the person
[29:28] we're bothered with our
[29:30] church we're bothered with our pastor
[29:33] you say brother
[29:36] Titus people are always bothered with me
[29:39] bothered with the
[29:41] brothers bothered by this bothered by
[29:45] that and why are we so
[29:49] bothered I think that's the question God
[29:51] ask
[29:52] Jonah why are you so
[29:56] bothered so
[29:59] unsatisfied why is there so much anger
[30:02] in
[30:03] you and the Bible said
[30:06] it that in the latter days there would
[30:08] be Tru Breakers that's the spirit of
[30:12] this
[30:13] time we see Wars all
[30:16] around why are there so much
[30:19] War why there many people that are
[30:24] angry we look at Israel
[30:28] and what they're going
[30:30] through such an angry people with them
[30:34] everyone around them want to kill them
[30:38] want to annihilate
[30:40] them why is there so much
[30:43] hate why is there so much
[30:47] hate we see the
[30:49] people everyone has their own
[30:52] opinion some
[30:53] saying that Israel is wrong
[30:57] because they're
[30:59] defending because they're killing
[31:01] children because they're killing
[31:06] women but they don't
[31:09] realize the only way to destroy an
[31:14] enemy is by not having
[31:22] compassion and others say that Palestine
[31:25] is wrong Hamas is
[31:28] wrong everyone choosing
[31:32] signs you look around the world
[31:34] everyone's
[31:35] choosing everyone is bothered by
[31:39] something and I look at in the spiritual
[31:42] World everyone is bothered by
[31:47] something gone a spirit of
[31:49] unsatisfaction and
[31:51] anger but you know
[31:53] what the children of God
[31:56] also
[31:57] must have a grown in
[32:00] them there should be
[32:02] something where they're not
[32:07] satisfied I say there are signs of the
[32:09] end time they are
[32:13] signs something is not right in this
[32:16] life the Bible
[32:19] says Romans 8 verse
[32:22] 15 I'm going to skip for the
[32:25] moment verse 20
[32:30] because the creature itself also shall
[32:32] be
[32:36] delivered be delivered from the bondage
[32:38] of corruption and the Glorious Liberty
[32:40] of the children of
[32:47] God for we know that the whole creation
[32:49] granth and travelleth and pain together
[32:51] until
[32:56] now
[33:01] forgive me for we know that the whole
[33:02] creation granth and travelleth and pain
[33:04] together until
[33:06] now I believe if there's a
[33:10] groan if there's unsatisfaction
[33:14] it's because there's something
[33:17] better come on
[33:21] church I believe if there's
[33:23] unsatisfaction in
[33:25] US there's a Gran inside
[33:29] us because there's something
[33:33] better aren't you glad to know there's
[33:35] something
[33:38] better this world is filled with
[33:40] unsatisfaction the Bible
[33:43] says that the days of
[33:46] man are
[33:49] bitter are
[33:51] unsatisfactory that's
[33:53] right
[33:55] am
[33:58] and the closer we get to the end
[34:02] time the more dissatisfaction there will
[34:07] be and more groaning there should be in
[34:10] God's
[34:12] children should be a groaning in God's
[34:15] children to know and
[34:19] say I want to be
[34:22] delivered I want to be delivered
[34:25] already this
[34:27] world can't give
[34:30] me what I
[34:32] need this
[34:35] world satisfy
[34:39] me not what I
[34:47] want when I see Jonah A little I
[34:54] think I think there was a great dissatis
[34:57] action inside
[35:00] him because he didn't understand what
[35:02] God was
[35:04] doing he didn't understand God's
[35:07] plan maybe he was
[35:10] bothered because he did not see God's
[35:15] justice maybe he said God where's your
[35:18] Justice
[35:20] n
[35:23] Assyria n was the capital of Assyria of
[35:27] the country of
[35:31] Assyria Assyria would be such a dreadful
[35:33] enemy to
[35:36] Israel it was a perverted
[35:39] place a Place full of
[35:43] wickedness even n's own King tells them
[35:48] to the
[35:50] nites leave your
[35:53] evil when they heard Jonah's message
[35:57] the king said leave your
[36:02] evil the king recognized how much more
[36:06] God it was such a Savage
[36:14] place maybe it wasn't so much a strange
[36:19] thing for Jonah to say Lord where's your
[36:24] Justice have you ever asked Lord where
[36:29] evil so much wickedness in this
[36:31] life so many things that shouldn't be
[36:34] the way they are come on
[36:38] church I'm speaking to a body that
[36:42] knows that knows this body this
[36:45] world that knows that our
[36:48] life our life is filled of
[36:53] mistakes the people make so many
[36:56] mistakes
[36:59] and you ask yourself God where's your
[37:01] Justice why are things this way you ever
[37:05] ask yourself the question why is it this
[37:09] way why did my life have to be this way
[37:12] come on
[37:13] church just look at your own
[37:16] life sometimes the devil fogs our
[37:20] vision sometimes
[37:22] he why does God allow you to go through
[37:25] this no no
[37:28] yes or no
[37:29] Brethren is that
[37:33] not isn't it that way that's why we're
[37:36] so
[37:37] unsatisfied because we can't understand
[37:39] God's
[37:40] plan we say why
[37:43] God why didn't you give me what I
[37:46] asked why didn't you make me go through
[37:49] this why this
[37:53] sickness I ask
[37:55] myself what brother John do oh I'm sorry
[37:59] I think brother
[38:01] John I see that you've asked yourself
[38:04] Lord
[38:06] why why have I been needing to go
[38:08] through
[38:10] this I believe we have all last
[38:14] ourselves real for a
[38:18] moment if Jonah was something at least
[38:21] he was
[38:22] honest Jonah asked him are you
[38:25] angry he said I'm very
[38:28] angry at least he was
[38:31] honest and many times we don't
[38:37] realize we don't want to say
[38:39] like but there's something inside us
[38:43] that is
[38:46] unsatisfying that's why sometimes we've
[38:48] given
[38:49] up many people that have given up they
[38:53] don't want to keep F they don't want to
[38:55] fight
[38:57] they come to
[38:59] church and they just do the
[39:02] minimum come on
[39:04] church and do the
[39:07] Min many of
[39:09] us given up on
[39:14] God we've given up on the
[39:18] church up in our
[39:22] [Applause]
[39:25] situation
[39:27] because we've told ourselves
[39:29] why why
[39:33] God why are things the way they
[39:39] are Jonah had a short
[39:44] Vision he wasn't seeing what God
[39:48] was God's
[39:50] plan to destroy
[39:53] nin do you know it was fulfilled
[39:58] 40 years later God
[40:00] did 40 years after Jonah
[40:05] preached then God destroyed
[40:08] n so God is not a
[40:11] liar God knows what he's
[40:14] doing he doesn't have to explain
[40:16] everything to
[40:19] Jonah to say look this is what I'm
[40:25] planning
[40:30] but Jonah was bothered because he didn't
[40:32] understand God's
[40:35] plan many times we are bothered and
[40:39] unsatisfied
[40:44] why because we fail to
[40:47] notice that this isn't
[40:50] everything this is my
[40:54] title this isn't
[40:57] this is not it there we go this is not
[41:00] it this is not
[41:04] it is not tell your neighbor this is not
[41:08] it I believe if God told Jonah
[41:12] this Jonah would have had a different
[41:16] perspective if God said Jonah this is
[41:19] not it don't be
[41:22] angry I have a greater plan
[41:26] I'm not showing everything to
[41:29] you this is not it your neighbor tell
[41:34] your
[41:38] neighbor this is not
[41:41] it what God will give
[41:44] us this is not
[41:46] it let me tell you
[41:49] brother need to tell the
[41:51] devil this is not
[41:55] it
[41:56] we need to have a revelation this
[41:59] morning need to let that frustration
[42:04] go we need to let our
[42:07] thoughts be clear for a
[42:10] moment while we hear God's
[42:13] voice this is not
[42:19] it sometimes we are disappointed with
[42:22] ourselves Amen
[42:24] brother sometimes we're
[42:27] disappointed but God tells
[42:31] us this is not
[42:33] it sometimes the devil tells
[42:36] us oh how sorry for
[42:39] you you have to answer
[42:43] Satan this is not
[42:47] it not what I should be
[42:50] yet I am not what I will be that's
[42:55] right
[43:00] this is not
[43:03] it this is not
[43:06] it if there's an unsatisfaction
[43:11] is because this is not
[43:16] it brother
[43:22] brandham in one occasion he
[43:25] says
[43:29] uh the message
[43:40] Moses the
[43:43] message blind
[43:50] B I was combing what few hairs I had
[43:52] left on my
[43:54] head uh speaking with with his
[44:00] wife she said to me Billy she said
[44:03] you're getting baldheaded
[44:07] honey I said I know
[44:10] sweetheart but I haven't lost a one of
[44:14] them she said

[1:09:10] to
[1:09:11] tree said it was such a beautiful

[1:09:48] that she said stay with
[1:09:51] that she said that's the
[1:09:55] thing and I or what is the sister saying

[1:10:35] Ghost if we should preach something it's

[1:10:40] Ghost we can all speak
[1:10:44] psychology Earth
[1:10:47] bless jobs and everything
[1:10:50] else that will not satisfy I will not
[1:10:54] take you over there but you preach the
[1:10:57] Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:11:01] G what the rest
[1:11:05] can't the Holy Spirit can take you to
[1:11:09] Eternity the Holy
[1:11:14] Spirit you see why the dev wanted to
[1:11:16] separate him from the
[1:11:19] Pentecostal he didn't want him to go
[1:11:21] preach to the
[1:11:22] Pentecost
[1:11:24] because they believed in the Holy
[1:11:26] Spirit they believed in receiving the
[1:11:28] Holy
[1:11:29] Spirit brother Bram was sent to
[1:11:32] the he was sent to preach the Holy
[1:11:35] Ghost he was sent to tell
[1:11:38] us nothing of this Ro will satisfy
[1:11:42] us but the holy spirit is
[1:11:45] enough that is what your soul
[1:11:48] needs it's what C
[1:11:51] your it's what tranquilizes US
[1:11:54] until we make it

[1:12:46] the Holy

[1:14:00] end sister hope could have told him many
[1:14:05] things could have told him many
[1:14:07] things but all she said was

[1:14:52] death
[1:14:56] musicians can
[1:15:07] come when you find
[1:15:13] out that the best is yet to
