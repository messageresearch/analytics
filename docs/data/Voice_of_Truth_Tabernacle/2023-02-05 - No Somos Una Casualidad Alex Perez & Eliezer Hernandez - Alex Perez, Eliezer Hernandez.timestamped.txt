[27:44] dead
[28:51] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[28:53] amen
[28:56] Ephesians chapter 1 11.
[29:12] in whom also we have obtained an
[29:14] inheritance being predestinated
[29:17] according to the purpose of him who
[29:19] worketh all things after the counsel of
[29:21] his own will
[29:22] find
[29:28] Cristo that we should be to the praise
[29:31] of his glory who first trusted in Christ
[29:34] verse 12.
[29:38] second Timothy chapter 1 verse 8 and 9.
[29:43] foreign
[30:08] nor of him his prisoner but be thou
[30:11] partaker of the afflictions of The
[30:13] Gospel According to the power of God
[30:17] pay attention to verse 9.
[30:26] who has saved us and called us within
[30:29] holy calling who called us dios
[30:34] and he called us with a purpose
[30:43] but according to his own purpose
[30:48] and Grace which was given us in Christ
[30:50] Jesus
[30:52] pay attention to the last part
[30:58] before the world began you may be
[31:02] serious Brothers
[31:03] they got our blessings to his word
[31:09] um
[31:10] we're in the title a purpose and a
[31:13] vision a theme
[31:17] all right so for this morning as well as
[31:19] brother Alex
[31:21] we're not a coincidence
[31:42] no no
[31:45] God has brought you to this day with a
[31:49] purpose
[31:50] so now is it why that people
[31:53] many times they think or believe and act
[31:59] as if though it was only a coincidence
[32:04] I I think I look at them and think
[32:12] when we act like as if there were a
[32:14] coincidence a
[32:18] um
[32:20] because we don't want to surrender or
[32:22] give accounts to anybody look Brothers
[32:26] the greatest minds of humanity
[32:31] in the world
[32:37] actually the biggest Theory there is
[32:40] that is that we come from a coincidence
[32:55] [Music]
[33:05] that has everything it does everything
[33:07] with a purpose so
[33:12] I asked myself
[33:19] has a purpose
[33:24] even your name in influencia has an
[33:28] influence sit on you
[33:30] know
[33:32] the names that our parents
[33:34] have an influence on us
[33:38] foreign
[33:53] Richard means rats
[33:57] we don't want any rats here right
[34:02] so everything in God
[34:05] there is no coincidence
[34:07] nothing happened by a coincidence
[34:09] nothing
[34:12] God had the delicacy
[34:16] to put you in a certain position or
[34:19] place
[34:25] sooner or later
[34:28] you know when Jesus Christ
[34:31] came to this world
[34:35] and he came to a small city of Bethlehem
[34:39] why did he get to Bethlehem porque why
[34:43] because it also has a significance
[34:47] why did he get to a bigger city
[34:52] so that he wouldn't suffer so much and
[34:55] sometimes we ask
[34:57] why are we born Mexicans
[34:59] oh why are we born
[35:02] why are we born this way
[35:06] our inheritance is this
[35:09] everything has a purpose
[35:12] why was I born in my family
[35:14] wow for Kim we Spanish foreign
[35:51] [Applause]
[36:00] they think that they have the right to
[36:02] do whatever they want when you do that
[36:07] you're not living with a purpose
[36:12] you're just living by a coincidence
[36:15] whatever comes to your mind is
[36:21] in the message God's gifts always find
[36:23] their places
[36:25] you know coincidence will always take
[36:27] you to something
[36:29] living as you want will always take you
[36:31] to something
[36:33] and what we'll take you is to
[36:35] rebelliousness
[36:38] we'll take it to uh rebelliousness
[36:42] to your um right
[36:46] Gia ruin this is
[36:50] in this paragraph 79.
[36:54] he went to New York this is
[36:56] [Music]
[37:01] a few weeks ago I went down I don't know
[37:04] the name of the place down there in New
[37:05] York
[37:10] where they just got city blocks of
[37:13] bitniks where it says that they're a
[37:14] youth of the rebellious okay this is
[37:21] now then grows down there with uh legal
[37:24] Tarts on and nothing on
[37:31] one of those little bikinis as they call
[37:34] it over the top of that because
[37:40] he says they do anything that's on their
[37:43] minds
[37:44] no matter what it is
[37:52] they can do just anything
[37:56] and they want to lay down don't get up
[37:58] yes
[37:59] just lay down and not get up
[38:02] if they want to go do a certain thing
[38:05] they do it if not they don't
[38:09] just traveling in their own minds
[38:13] and what does the unconverted mind come
[38:16] to wow
[38:19] where does the mind go to there's no
[38:21] purpose something
[38:27] yourself
[39:17] no one else can force you
[39:20] yes
[39:24] appointed with the gun to come to church
[39:26] today we're like you know right nobody
[39:28] was
[39:30] because we want something better yes
[39:35] well when the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:38] was born in this world
[39:42] he was born in the worst place
[39:44] that you could yourself imagine
[39:49] but there wasn't even much people
[39:52] there was animals
[39:55] there was a filthiness
[39:58] but he chose to be born there with a
[40:04] purpose
[40:07] the three the three wise men yeah got
[40:12] there
[40:13] came with three gifts amen amen
[40:18] those three gifts was gold significantly
[40:22] that which means deity
[40:24] the incense significance which means
[40:27] service
[40:30] that means bitterness or death oh
[40:43] to death
[40:45] that's right
[40:48] that has to be the purpose
[40:52] I can't be like Jesus Christ
[40:55] [Music]
[40:56] it's a lot to ask to be like Jesus
[41:00] Christ
[41:01] I want to tell you this morning
[41:03] that it is possible to be like Jesus
[41:06] Christ
[41:09] many times we see Jesus Christ
[41:12] as the father I don't know
[41:17] Jesus Christ is our brother
[41:20] our older brother
[41:23] as our older brothers
[41:25] he came to put an example for us
[41:29] just like I did
[41:32] I want you to do it as well
[41:40] that
[41:45] lights up our purpose Siempre always
[41:50] when the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:54] that John had been oppressed
[41:58] then he began his ministry Jesus
[42:03] Jesus doesn't go Jesus Christ
[42:07] Jesus Christ doesn't impose something
[42:11] Jesus Christ is always waiting time his
[42:14] time and his place
[42:15] even though we're not ready
[42:21] amen
[42:24] locations everything in the Lord Jesus
[42:27] Christ
[42:33] everything everything
[42:41] even when he took out the belts
[42:46] and began to give some good ones to
[42:48] everybody
[42:59] how is it that he called his disciples
[43:02] that was not a coincidence it had a
[43:06] purpose it has a purpose
[43:09] where did he called him from
[43:14] and all the the man that God calls
[43:19] they had always been
[43:21] always yes they were already working
[43:24] that's right
[43:25] foreign

[45:24] [Music]
[45:26] but God wants us to bless others
[45:31] everything that we do is foreign
[46:15] have we heard
[46:20] or do we live everything to to the
[46:23] coincidence
[46:26] or let life take take its course
[46:35] Thomas significa means twin this is this
[46:40] is
[46:42] Jesus it says it seems that Thomas
[46:44] looked a lot like Jesus
[46:47] no
[46:50] Brothers I would like to to be like
[46:53] Jesus
[46:55] none of his appearance not his
[46:58] appearance no
[47:00] um
[47:01] physical appearance
[47:04] but in everything else
[47:07] I would like to be like Jesus
[47:13] means the son of taomai
[47:16] we're sons of somebody
[47:19] no we're not sons of coincidence
[47:23] we're sons of someone
[47:26] now John
[47:51] it means manly or masculine
[47:55] so in other words a hard worker
[48:17] what have you done for your brother or

[48:49] is for good yeah
[48:51] and that's something that is for bad
[48:54] there's something in us
[48:57] to get rid of
[49:08] a power
[49:13] gift of God
[49:17] Judas Iscariot and uh Judas tadius means
[49:22] praised
[49:23] foreign
[49:49] whoever wants to conduct an orchestra
[49:52] must turn their back to the crowd

[50:01] see us no no no no no no
[50:04] he that directs the orchestra
[50:08] will never give his face to the audience
[50:12] no we're not a coincidence
[50:26] let us read first Ephesians
[50:32] but we are his work mentions created in
[50:35] Christ Jesus unto good works
[50:39] which God had before ordained that we
[50:42] should walk in them
[50:47] [Music]
[51:13] many generations back so that you could
[51:16] be here tonight
[51:18] this morning did you know that think
[51:21] about it
[51:22] that you at one time
[51:25] he says I'll repeat this again
[51:30] you at one time was in your father in
[51:33] the gene of your father
[51:35] now he didn't know you at that time
[51:39] neither did you know him but you see
[51:42] usted
[51:55] and then you became a person expressed
[51:58] in the image like your father like your
[52:00] father
[52:02] that is where the fellowship then
[52:05] there's the fellowship
[52:07] we need to enter into the fellowship
[52:10] with a purpose
[52:12] we need to this is
[52:16] who needs life this morning
[52:33] no brothers
[52:35] they need us we need them
[52:42] you know a good purpose
[52:44] and to understand the vision
[52:47] gives you a mission
[52:51] a mission
[52:53] a purpose that you have to fulfill God
[52:57] bless you
[53:00] foreign
[54:01] Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye
[54:04] Lands
[54:11] serve the Lord with gladness come before
[54:13] his presence with singing
[54:17] I'll ask you a question in this morning
[54:23] with joy with happiness
[54:27] that God is with you because
[54:32] on verse 3 and now this is where we want
[54:34] to focus on this is
[54:47] that the Lord he is
[54:57] a center of all things
[55:04] recognize that the Lord
[55:10] the first thing that we have to do in
[55:12] our lives to First find our purpose is
[55:16] that God is the center of all things
[55:26] it continues to say knowing ye that the
[55:28] Lord he is
[55:34] it is he that has made us and not we
[55:37] ourselves
[55:40] the second point in which I'd like to
[55:42] tell you in this morning
[55:44] you did not create yourself
[55:58] according to the words
[56:15] and not we ourselves is
[57:10] of our actions
[57:13] we don't want we don't we don't have
[57:15] someone to tell us what to do no no no
[57:17] no no
[57:19] we don't seek advice we don't seek
[57:21] guidance
[57:30] Vision in which who I am in this life
[57:40] the person is
[58:10] foreign
[59:33] you're a coincidence
[59:38] you're here in this life with a purpose
[59:40] amen
[59:41] [Music]
[59:43] look there's people that live their life
[59:50] and all they think everything is is a
[59:52] coincidence
[59:55] everything they think is just luck
[59:58] I don't believe in karma
[1:00:02] if you follow the statues
[1:00:07] the statues of God
[1:00:13] and everything's gonna be fine
[1:00:18] now I want to remind you in this morning
[1:00:20] maybe
[1:00:26] someone said to you
[1:00:29] you were an accident when you were born
[1:00:32] why
[1:00:34] I want to say it is
[1:00:39] maybe for a parent it wasn't their plan
[1:00:41] for you to come to this world
[1:00:50] he is waiting for you
[1:00:54] he was waiting for you to be born
[1:00:57] that's right
[1:01:00] circumstances because the plans of God
[1:01:03] doesn't have to do with the
[1:01:04] circumstances in which we're living in
[1:01:06] the city now you may step into the city
[1:01:08] you could say
[1:01:12] I came from the world
[1:01:16] the pastor will be my oh my God foreign
[1:02:05] foreign
[1:02:39] that was
[1:02:40] gone here
[1:02:46] my life would be different
[1:02:50] a young man
[1:02:54] if I was six feet tall
[1:03:00] the ladies will pay attention to me
[1:03:06] they can't accept themselves
[1:03:36] because God created me hey man

[1:05:24] neighbor

[1:40:40] someone has to stay with the children
[1:40:46] sometimes we have votes from the church
[1:40:53] we included all the members of the
[1:40:55] church in that
[1:40:57] each member from the church is someone
