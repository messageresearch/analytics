[21:10] [Music]
[21:15] foreign
[21:21] [Music]
[22:19] came to bring Familia valenciadas a
[22:23] balance to the families
[22:25] a balanced message
[22:28] a balanced Doctrine
[22:31] that's what we'll be speaking Familia
[22:34] Valencia a balanced family
[22:41] Zechariah Chapter 4 verse 10.
[22:48] for who has despise the day of small
[22:51] things for they shall rejoice
[22:53] [Music]
[23:02] with those seven they are the eyes of
[23:04] the Lord which run to and fro through
[23:07] the whole earth
[23:09] we'll read another scripture in Daniel
[23:14] it's close to Zechariah
[23:18] Daniel chapter five Daniel capido Los
[23:21] Cinco Daniel chapter five
[23:25] I hope everyone is well this morning
[23:29] I'm very glad to see everyone
[23:33] Daniel 5 27 Daniel
[23:37] 5 27
[23:45] thou are weighed in the balances and are
[23:48] found wanting let us pray
[23:51] Heavenly Father we give you thanks my
[23:54] God
[23:56] for one more opportunity
[23:59] for your mercies
[24:04] because we don't deserve it Lord
[24:07] just to know we don't deserve it
[24:10] should be enough foreign
[24:40] foreign
[25:43] henceforth families are unbalanced
[25:47] they focus too much on one area
[25:51] there are people that are too Republican
[25:55] and people who are too tired
[25:58] or people that are too legalists
[26:04] there's people that don't like black
[26:07] people
[26:13] nowadays we see people are more fond of
[26:16] our ex-presidents and there are people
[26:19] that hate him
[26:23] and another group of people hate another
[26:26] group of people
[26:31] all because people go to an extreme this
[26:34] is
[26:39] they're a Democrat nor Republican
[26:43] I am a citizen of a Heavenly Kingdom
[26:48] and all of politics are rotten
[26:51] there's nothing good about it absolutely
[26:55] [Applause]
[26:58] but people now and they are extremists
[27:02] that's the type of world we live
[27:06] not just in the political world
[27:09] but also in the religious World
[27:13] there are people that are two legalists
[27:17] and there's people that are too liberals
[27:21] and both extremes are incorrect
[27:26] where God came to bring us a message
[27:29] that is a balanced message
[27:39] coming no it came to set us in the
[27:42] middle of the race
[27:47] and not go too much to the edge
[27:55] to the point where we're going to uh in
[27:58] the in a deep interest
[28:02] so I know we're not speaking on them
[28:05] but it has to do a little bit
[28:08] and I'm taking the description Zechariah
[28:11] this is
[28:14] for who has despised the day of small
[28:17] things for they shall rejoice
[28:25] instrumental now notice this is
[28:29] that God puts in the
[28:32] handsome
[28:37] I believe he said in the hands of the
[28:39] seventh messenger
[28:41] that brought the message
[28:47] as an instrument usually used by
[28:49] Carpenters
[28:50] Builders
[28:52] people that build things
[28:56] an instrument
[29:05] that it's not leaning too much to the
[29:08] left or too much to the right
[29:10] normally it's a string
[29:14] peso and on the bottom it has yes
[29:22] if it's an iron or wood uh
[29:26] but there's something heavy weighing it
[29:29] holding it down
[29:32] so make sure that the line is centered
[29:37] and it's straight from top to bottom
[29:43] that it's not unbalanced
[29:47] because if something is built on balance
[29:52] doesn't matter how strong the material
[29:54] is
[29:56] there will be problems and all the
[30:16] in the message
[30:21] I'm not a legalist this is
[30:24] he says I am not a legalist how many
[30:28] believe this this is
[30:36] [Applause]
[30:38] but I believe that each one had a
[30:40] Doctrine
[30:42] but they run off on the deep side of it
[30:46] they just stayed with us
[30:49] and didn't balance the thing up
[30:53] there's a highway and away
[30:56] is the road
[30:59] a highway
[31:03] over here
[31:12] entry
[31:21] in El Camino but get in the way Entre en
[31:26] el camino get in the way
[31:29] saw your neighbor get in the way
[31:34] don't be on the highway
[31:38] oh don't be on the gutter and they'll be
[31:41] on the gutter yes
[31:45] because they build roads a certain way
[31:49] so that the trash in water
[31:57] and all the water is
[32:01] and it's the filth or garbage that is
[32:04] going to the edge
[32:06] but the way is in between
[32:10] the way
[32:18] Isaiah says
[32:20] there shall be a highway and away
[32:28] which brings the highway
[32:45] you remember how they called it the way
[32:47] in the Bible
[32:51] all that was found in the this way they
[32:54] say is
[33:06] that you need to stay in the middle of
[33:09] the way
[33:13] familiar now I want to bring this to the
[33:16] or the lives of in our homes of family
[33:19] because there are people familias there
[33:22] are families I esposos there's husbands
[33:25] there's children
[33:32] that have gone too far to the edge
[33:36] they've been unbalanced completely
[33:40] and that's why their families are
[33:42] falling to pieces
[33:44] that's why churches are falling
[33:48] that's why Christians are falling
[33:51] because to keep standing
[33:54] you need to have a balance
[34:00] you cannot keep a balance you will fall
[34:05] foreign
[34:10] [Applause]
[34:29] you cannot use your strength
[34:37] it can be very strong in your arms
[34:41] and be weak at the legs
[34:50] and all the muscles you have on your
[34:52] upper body don't matter
[34:55] if your feet or legs can't balance it
[35:00] are you with me brother
[35:02] that's why we fall so much
[35:06] that's why we're derailed very easy
[35:09] Diablo that's why the Devil beats us
[35:13] because we can't stay standing
[35:17] see what brother Brown continue saying
[35:19] this Amigos
[35:21] friends I've always tried to keep a
[35:24] balance Del Camino of the road
[35:27] you get way off on foreign
[35:31] equal just as foreign
[36:37] ties
[36:39] Luke or Steve
[36:41] and both are wrong
[36:44] Familia now what happens in the family
[36:48] a lot of things I go on in a family
[36:51] that are in extreme
[36:55] that's why the family foreign
[37:05] [Applause]
[37:33] but it's not the only word
[38:18] a story about a father
[38:23] saying that his daughter
[38:26] was stolen diapers
[38:53] calm down
[38:55] yeah
[39:00] [Applause]
[39:05] he tried to calm his daughter down
[39:09] until she fell crying
[39:13] she was quiet and so she was quiet
[39:20] and when they got home
[39:23] says that he wants to go change your
[39:26] diet
[39:30] and he noticed that inside her diaper
[39:33] there was a piece of ice
[39:36] he said he felt so horrible
[39:43] in there maybe one of his uncles or
[39:46] nephews that were playing with his
[39:48] daughter
[39:49] and she was complaining
[39:53] she didn't know how to express what she
[39:55] was feeling yes
[39:59] Father for being too legalists
[40:04] didn't take time to investigate
[40:08] and it's he says that's how we are
[40:11] that's how we are sometimes Brothers
[40:16] we don't take the time to here
[40:34] find out what's wrong
[40:49] is black
[40:55] God in one occasion
[40:58] Ally
[41:03] he wanted his people to cross through
[41:04] the Promised Land
[41:07] but they weren't ready
[41:11] he even sent spies
[41:15] to go and spy on the land
[41:19] but they weren't ready and what did God
[41:22] do it did he force them do you know God
[41:27] doesn't Force anyone
[41:33] because you aren't ready
[41:37] let's wait for you 40 years
[41:48] until you grow a little
[41:51] this is that is our God
[41:58] he wanted to kill other people
[42:01] and start again with Moses
[42:06] and Moses stood between God and the
[42:09] people
[42:09] and said God
[42:12] if you do this what will they say
[42:16] forgive them
[42:19] brother Branham says
[42:23] God heard Moses
[42:26] the spirit of Christ
[42:30] prayer changes things
[42:34] change God's mind
[42:44] Moses could change what God was about to
[42:48] do
[42:51] legalists
[43:14] we take an extreme
[43:18] the man has the final word
[43:37] when he became to be king
[43:44] the older counselors or Elders that were
[43:48] his counselors told him
[43:52] Solomon for the people to be on your
[43:54] side
[43:56] you should make these changes
[43:59] don't burden them so much
[44:03] don't do these things
[44:05] the people will be on your side
[44:08] and what did salmon do is
[44:13] he heard the voice of other young
[44:16] friends
[44:24] and they better
[44:41] that never followed him again
[44:48] and that's why parents mothers and
[44:51] fathers lose their children
[44:53] they take an extreme
[44:56] they tell their children
[45:01] you're gonna do this because you're
[45:03] going to do it
[45:06] and there's no way of getting out of it
[45:09] you know you need to be very careful
[45:12] Holy Ghost leading you
[45:16] a lot of dance
[45:19] you imbalance your household
[45:23] and it causes you to take an extreme
[45:30] now God says through Daniel
[45:35] yeah
[45:36] I'm returning to Daniel 5 27.
[45:40] Thou Art weighed in the balances and are
[45:43] found once
[45:44] God is a balanced God
[46:18] a type of Jesus Christ
[46:21] he also created Lucifer
[46:27] and Lucifer was all similar
[46:31] differences the only difference was that
[46:34] he could not create
[46:36] but in everything else he was the same
[46:39] to balance
[46:43] he had to make
[46:46] luciferos Valencia God is a god of
[46:49] balance
[47:00] not only did he leave her with a cane
[47:04] Regency
[47:20] [Applause]
[48:07] the correction they made
[48:17] correct attraction how they love
[48:19] Corrections there's people that love
[48:22] correcting
[48:24] but to bring out a drop of love from
[48:27] them
[48:28] you know what you're you're more wrong
[48:32] for doing that
[48:38] then if you just left things in the
[48:40] hands of God
[48:45] now there's others I go to another
[48:47] extreme
[48:49] that give their children everything they
[48:53] give their wife everything
[48:59] you spoil them
[49:04] and they're completely spoiled
[49:09] they never want anything
[49:14] they want to please
[49:20] and you already want to be there
[49:42] [Applause]
[49:51] [Applause]
[49:55] fear of Our Lives
[50:08] yeah
[50:10] that's right
[50:13] so there's people that go completely to
[50:15] once
[50:16] they don't want their families
[50:25] it's not just them that has a headache
[50:27] but the whole family stays at home
[50:31] that's going to benefit them
[50:35] you should come instead and pray for
[50:37] them
[50:41] you think you should do everything for
[50:43] your family
[50:55] but he doesn't give her everything
[51:00] he he uh tests
[51:06] he says in the world he should have
[51:08] affliction
[51:10] do not be surprised
[51:30] doesn't want his family to suffer
[51:35] is causing
[51:41] them to lose blessings from God
[51:46] stay dwarfs spiritually
[51:50] and you're denying the power
[51:54] because it's guard that watches
[51:59] you cannot be there 24 hours a day
[52:03] watch them 24 hours a day
[52:10] but there's people that take another
[52:12] extreme
[52:14] and they don't care what their children
[52:16] do
[52:18] it
[52:19] that's the Other Extreme
[52:23] they don't watch their children
[52:26] they let them do what they want
[52:30] that's incorrect
[52:32] giving them to the devil
[52:36] oh what your children are doing
[52:39] but not force them foreign
[53:21] I am balancing there's a balance there's
[53:25] a center
[53:30] means
[53:34] our weight in the balances
[53:38] so you got wages in the balance
[53:43] repeat God weighs me in the balance
[53:54] estebien for a a balance to be right
[53:58] there
[54:00] has to be weight on both sides
[54:04] he can't just give us all blessings
[54:10] because the balance is
[54:18] needs to come to balance it is
[54:22] and also he can leave us alone
[54:33] that protects us that helps us
[54:41] spiritual is the same type
[54:44] there's people that are very legalists
[54:46] in church
[54:50] that hate seeing someone that that isn't
[54:54] how they should be
[54:55] let me tell you you're lost
[55:08] foreign
[55:52] put some weight on the other side
[56:00] let not mercy and Truth forsake thee
[56:04] find them
[56:07] write them upon the table Yeah
[56:13] find favor and good understanding in the
[56:16] sight of God and man
[56:18] notice it's not only the truth
[56:21] it's not only the truth
[56:27] God doesn't only want worshipers in
[56:30] truth
[56:32] there's people that hold on so much
[56:35] and they forget
[56:37] the mercy this is
[56:41] it says let not Mercy for safety there
[56:46] are two things
[56:47] the truth is
[56:49] Mercy is something else
[56:51] [Applause]
[57:18] you aren't forgiven
[57:21] yes
[57:24] christovino Jesus Christ came
[57:27] not to remove the law he came to balance
[57:32] he came to add on to the law
[57:36] prosecutors
[57:39] when they brought the woman found in
[57:41] adultery before him
[57:44] if he would have taken a legalist side
[57:50] Moses says to kill her kill her
[57:54] so balance things
[57:59] God does not take away
[58:01] he balances it
[58:05] because that's the only way to be strong
[58:09] if you only have good
[58:13] devil you'll be weak if you only have
[58:17] evil
[58:18] you'll be weak pero balances
[58:22] repeat I need both things
[58:28] but we also need a mercy
[58:35] when you correct your children
[58:39] remember you need both things
[58:50] [Music]
[58:53] so balance
[58:57] there are children that you tell them
[58:59] one word and they do it
[59:01] but there are children
[59:07] 10 times it seems they don't understand
[59:11] sometimes what they need is to balance
[59:15] things
[59:18] so that they can receive strength
[59:24] does a better job when you encourage
[59:28] them and support them
[59:33] only criticize him
[59:38] that's scientifically proven
[59:41] a person does a better job
[59:45] when you encourage and support them
[59:48] then when you only criticize them
[59:54] this was intolerance that's everywhere
[59:58] not only do your children need to be
[1:00:00] corrected
[1:00:01] they need to be praised
[1:00:04] you need to tell them you're doing a
[1:00:07] great job son I'm proud
[1:00:11] that you're thriving
[1:00:14] God is a balance
[1:00:17] who God gives
[1:00:20] God demands
[1:00:22] is that God's word
[1:00:27] god Demands a lot
[1:00:30] let me tell you brother God has given us
[1:00:34] a lot
[1:00:35] has given us too much
[1:00:38] may God help us
[1:00:44] families with our families
[1:00:47] giving us a balanced message
[1:00:54] it stays in the middle
[1:00:58] until this
[1:01:00] then God says
[1:01:06] we know the scripture very well
[1:01:09] Ecclesiastes three
[1:01:12] so everything there is a season
[1:01:15] repeat everything again everything
[1:01:19] not the problem
[1:01:22] is that we take a side on certain things
[1:01:27] instead of saying
[1:01:29] I need to add on of everything
[1:01:33] not just Corrections
[1:01:36] not just sweetness
[1:01:40] but there needs to be sweetness
[1:01:44] this is
[1:01:45] so everything there is a season
[1:01:52] and a time to every purpose under the
[1:01:54] heaven
[1:01:55] a time to be born a time to die
[1:02:00] a time to plan any time to pluck up
[1:02:03] it's time to kill and it's time to heal
[1:02:07] a time to break down and a time to build
[1:02:10] up
[1:02:12] so if you see something wrong
[1:02:15] go against it in the name of the Lord
[1:02:18] but then rebuild it
[1:02:21] don't leave it
[1:02:24] the problem is that we don't balance
[1:02:27] things
[1:02:29] we're very unbalanced
[1:02:32] hey man
[1:02:34] if you're going to correct something do
[1:02:36] it
[1:02:37] but later
[1:02:39] go and pick up that Fallen child
[1:02:42] my son you can do it
[1:02:45] I'm here with you I won't leave you
[1:02:49] I heard a saying somewhere
[1:02:53] I know the Bible says it this way
[1:02:57] but I enjoyed more how I read it
[1:03:02] says it said a father
[1:03:09] then 10 000 teachers
[1:03:12] but a father
[1:03:16] someone there with you
[1:03:19] someone I will suffer with you
[1:03:23] someone that will stand next to you
[1:03:26] someone you can count on
[1:03:31] he'll show you more some he'll show you
[1:03:34] more than ten thousand characters
[1:03:36] but the problem is we only want to be
[1:03:38] teachers sometimes and not parents
[1:03:51] support them
[1:03:53] are you with me brother
[1:03:57] Valencia a balanced family
[1:04:02] verse 8 says
[1:04:04] a time
[1:04:10] of war and a time of Peace
[1:04:16] what's wrong is that sometimes we like
[1:04:18] War more than
[1:04:20] there's people that like War more than
[1:04:23] peace
[1:04:24] fighting
[1:04:46] they only enjoy attacking and killing
[1:04:49] you need to know what's
[1:04:52] a fight and what's a lead yes
[1:05:00] arrows need to be fast
[1:05:03] choose
[1:05:14] without receiving a reward
[1:05:17] just because you want a victory
[1:05:24] that's the same in church and in the
[1:05:26] family there's people that love work
[1:05:29] those people
[1:05:32] cut my head off
[1:05:39] and kill me
[1:05:50] it's boring
[1:05:54] and there's people that are on the other
[1:05:56] side
[1:06:00] love and you scold them and they want to
[1:06:03] leave the church
[1:06:06] but you need both things
[1:06:09] our God is a balanced God
[1:06:13] you need both things
[1:06:17] so if you're on the edge
[1:06:20] start getting closer to the middle
[1:06:24] because there's people that have told us
[1:06:28] why do you play volleyball
[1:06:33] you should be all the time
[1:06:36] in prayer and fasting
[1:06:45] why do you go on vacation
[1:06:53] I just
[1:06:56] heard it this morning
[1:06:59] I wasn't searching for it
[1:07:07] to spend time reading the Bible
[1:07:12] we're too unbalanced
[1:07:22] there's people that have left the church
[1:07:24] because we play volleyball
[1:07:28] they don't balance things
[1:07:32] they don't realize that we need
[1:07:35] everything in this yeah
[1:07:37] we need both Good and Evil
[1:07:40] yeah
[1:07:43] read second Peter 3 14.
[1:07:49] I'm going to skip that one First
[1:07:51] Corinthians 10.
[1:07:58] Temptation taking you but such as a as
[1:08:01] is common to man
[1:08:03] but God is faithful repeat God is
[1:08:07] faithful

[1:08:12] neighbor God is faithful
[1:08:17] righteous is God
[1:08:24] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:08:27] above that ye are able to
[1:08:32] with the temptation
[1:08:36] also make a way
[1:08:39] to escape
