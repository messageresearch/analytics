[44:35] [Music]
[44:41] [Music]
[44:43] god bless you brothers
[44:46] how many are happy to be here tonight
[45:02] i
[45:27] therefore if any man be in christ he is
[45:29] a new creature
[45:31] all things are passed away behold all
[45:33] things are become new
[45:35] the mono question
[45:42] um before i continue i want to thank my
[45:44] pastor roberto
[46:12] is um
[46:16] what type of life am i living
[46:20] am i am i good with the life that i'm
[46:22] living
[46:25] am i happy for who i am
[46:29] because many times we are living two
[46:31] types of lives
[46:35] are living a life in church
[46:39] and then we we come out
[46:49] and do things we are not supposed to do
[46:53] us do things that we shouldn't be doing
[46:54] as
[47:08] that we cannot
[47:31] um there's something that
[47:34] that's i believe that who am i is a
[47:36] personal
[47:45] [Music]
[47:48] and check our lives through the bible
[48:04] who
[48:20] who are we when we are fulfilling all of
[48:21] god's word
[48:25] when we are in god's past
[48:28] when we are doing when we are obeying
[48:30] all of the words
[48:46] because many people only see what we are
[48:49] um
[48:49] outside
[48:54] but i believe that we know uh the things
[48:56] that we battle with
[49:00] and that we should know who who uh who
[49:03] we actually
[49:04] are um if you co-open your bibles to
[49:09] luke chapter 18 verse 18.
[49:14] verse
[49:22] and a certain ruler asked him saying
[49:24] good master what shall i do to
[49:25] her eternal life
[49:43] do not commit adultery do not kill do
[49:45] not still do not bear false testimony
[49:48] do not fail what false witness honor thy
[49:51] father and thy mother
[49:55] no matters
[50:00] and he said all these things have i kept
[50:02] from my youth up
[50:03] now when jesus heard these things he
[50:05] said unto him
[50:11] lakis do one thing sell all that lou has
[50:13] and distribute
[50:14] unto the poor and do shall have treasure
[50:16] in heaven and come follow me
[50:18] jesus
[50:27] and when he heard this he was very
[50:29] sorrowful for he was very rich
[50:31] anton says
[50:36] this certain ruler este
[50:44] he was looking for something that the
[50:46] things of this world could not give
[50:48] foreign
[50:51] he was looking for something that um
[50:54] that the material things cannot get him
[50:57] something that he couldn't buy
[50:59] material
[51:02] he had a hole in deep down in the soul
[51:22] or yeah i could imagine him being
[51:24] looking around
[51:25] him and saying what's missing
[51:31] and sometimes we are looking for the
[51:33] same things
[51:48] he
[52:00] we get trapped in the things that the
[52:02] world has for us
[52:44] um
[53:25] and he said he that will come to me i
[53:27] will no
[53:28] wise cast him out
[53:32] no matter what your back life has been i
[53:34] like this a lot because
[53:36] it shows us
[54:10] and that's why we are here right now yes
[54:13] no it doesn't matter what we've done in
[54:15] our past lives
[54:18] because as the bible says
[54:21] when we are in christ we are now a new
[54:23] creature and christos
[54:26] we are somebody new zomos
[54:29] has passed away but there has to be a
[54:33] certain point where
[54:34] where where we say i'm gonna
[55:24] and now it becomes a memory and we see
[55:26] how god has
[55:27] protected us from so many different
[55:28] things
[55:39] [Music]
[55:47] uh um take a step forward
[55:51] it would make us continue on
[55:54] but sometimes our past are speaking to
[55:57] us
[56:00] our past tells us remember when you used
[56:02] to
[56:03] do all these things
[56:07] remember when you used to uh um be with
[56:09] your friends
[56:12] remember when you used to be doing burst
[56:14] of weight
[56:28] something new to
[57:09] [Applause]
[57:10] god
[57:50] this uh this evening and that's not no
[57:52] chair
[58:01] um let us pray before we start
[58:20] you look
[58:48] it says when jesus came into the coast
[58:50] of caesarea philippi
[58:52] he asked his disciples saying whom do
[58:54] men say that i the son of man
[58:56] am cuando yo jesus
[58:59] pregnant
[59:05] and they said some say that thou art
[59:08] john the baptist
[59:10] some elias and others uh jeremiah's
[59:14] or one of the prophets juan
[59:30] and simon peter answered and said thou
[59:32] art the christ the son of the living god
[59:40] and jesus answered and said unto him
[1:00:17] um like i said for a title uh we titled
[1:00:21] it uh identity crisis
[1:00:26] uh
[1:00:30] those of you that read the message
[1:00:33] you know i just i can't he says it so
[1:00:36] many times
[1:00:38] he says you know when the church finds
[1:00:40] out who they
[1:00:50] [Applause]
[1:01:05] [Applause]
[1:01:08] let the fundamentalists let them people
[1:01:10] who deny the power of god say it's wrong
[1:01:20] but that same power that spoke the world
[1:01:22] into existence
[1:01:35] it's time that we found out who you are
[1:01:40] the devil's trying to hide you back
[1:01:43] they tell you what you're some little
[1:01:45] tried down something
[1:01:46] you said you're not
[1:01:50] you said no
[1:01:56] [Applause]
[1:02:04] i believe yo that we're living in a time
[1:02:09] that where we just where where people
[1:02:10] just don't know who they are
[1:02:14] in the world they don't know who they
[1:02:15] are
[1:02:17] you know that that's why we have so much
[1:02:19] you know we have so much going on around
[1:02:21] the world
[1:02:23] you know i'll go ahead and say
[1:02:28] they don't they don't not only do they
[1:02:30] not know who they are
[1:02:34] but they don't know what they are i
[1:02:36] don't know something
[1:02:38] you know it is true yes like you know
[1:02:41] what one day
[1:02:42] oh you can see uh uh you know uh you
[1:02:45] think he's a man
[1:02:46] who said
[1:03:01] amen amen we're
[1:03:04] we're gonna we're gonna just uh just
[1:03:06] look into some definitions here
[1:03:11] what is identity que s identi
[1:03:14] the
[1:03:28] you see what happens is brothers
[1:03:32] when when we think of identity
[1:03:35] that oh we just we think of of what we
[1:03:37] have on
[1:03:38] us of the claws that we wear
[1:04:19] [Applause]
[1:04:21] there's something greater behind the
[1:04:23] clothes that you have
[1:05:19] you know and your child may not know who
[1:05:21] he is
[1:05:23] you know i don't blame that on anybody
[1:05:25] else but the parents
[1:05:29] it's the parent's job
[1:05:32] to let his child
[1:05:48] you are a daughter
[1:06:00] it's just an identity crisis
[1:06:04] amen amen and you know the word crisis
[1:06:10] you know i'm just going to read the
[1:06:12] definition
[1:06:14] it's is any event it's called event
[1:06:38] and that's the crisis that that that
[1:06:40] this world is in yes it's like
[1:06:43] that's the crisis that
[1:06:57] approaches peter assassinated
[1:07:12] he knew exactly who he was
[1:07:15] he wasn't going to ask the question
[1:07:19] if he didn't know who he was
[1:07:22] and that's how we act many times
[1:07:26] you see we ask
[1:07:54] and it should
[1:08:14] [Applause]
[1:08:34] you might have about 40 or 50 uh you
[1:08:35] know of dresses
[1:08:37] in the closets
[1:08:41] and then you then you you're telling
[1:08:43] somebody that you don't know
[1:08:44] you don't have anything to wear
[1:08:49] to the women that that's a crisis
