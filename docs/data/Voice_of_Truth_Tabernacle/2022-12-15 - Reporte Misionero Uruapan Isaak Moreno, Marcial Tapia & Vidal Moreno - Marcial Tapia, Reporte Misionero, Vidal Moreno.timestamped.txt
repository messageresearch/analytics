[22:04] um
[22:04] just want to give thanks to God first
[22:09] um for giving us a chance to go to
[22:11] Mexico
[22:13] who's going to give kind of a little
[22:15] testimony
[22:16] in a little background
[22:19] and our other brothers will be kind of
[22:21] bringing the word but
[22:25] um you know on the way over there
[22:28] you know it's a beautiful way over there
[22:31] I guess
[22:33] I'm spending time with the brothers
[22:36] a little tiring as well I believe all
[22:40] missionary trips are pretty tired
[22:45] it was pretty exciting to see josuego
[22:47] over there
[22:50] his first missionary trip
[22:54] on Fridays me and him preach together
[23:00] he gave a little testimony and a little
[23:02] preaching testimony
[23:05] and we talked about seeing the invisible
[23:08] yeah
[23:11] and as a subtitle making a choice and
[23:16] [Music]
[23:17] um the whole theme of the of this trip
[23:21] is
[23:24] receiving the reward foreign
[23:27] so we're just talking about
[23:30] um you know receiving a rewards
[23:34] and making a choice
[23:37] and to serving God or serving this world
[23:41] would you serving the devil right okay
[23:43] and
[23:45] um you know it was amazing service
[23:48] I'm seeing all the brothers again
[23:52] um brother Edgar and his family picked
[23:54] us up from the airport
[23:56] you know the brothers were very happy to
[23:59] see us again
[24:02] and on Saturday yes my brother Marshall
[24:05] and my dad preach
[24:08] and I think they preached
[24:11] receiving the reward or something
[24:15] but that was another great preacher and
[24:18] great service
[24:20] and it's just amazing to see how much
[24:23] new people are are joining yes
[24:28] you see um the first time we went La
[24:31] primeroes it's um you know it's kind of
[24:34] just the main ones that were already
[24:35] there I believe
[24:40] and it was about probably I want to say
[24:43] 30 people the first time we went about
[24:45] the max that we had in the service
[24:50] but this this last time that we went
[24:54] I want to say there was about 60 people
[24:56] there
[24:58] and you know it's growing yes and it's
[25:02] just amazing to see how the word could
[25:04] spread so fast
[25:07] and you know we're talking me and my dad
[25:10] and I believe it was brother Marshall
[25:13] and it really touched me what he was
[25:16] saying
[25:18] because he was saying you know if he
[25:21] said you know we could go on these
[25:22] missionary trips and things
[25:26] so he's like if we don't have nothing to
[25:28] give what's the point
[25:31] he's like see first you have to work on
[25:33] yourself
[25:36] then we could go over there
[25:39] and give over there is that touched me a
[25:43] lot because you know sometimes we're
[25:45] asleep here
[25:48] we're not working on ourselves here
[25:51] we expect to go somewhere else
[25:54] and to give something over there
[25:57] and be shouting and jumping yeah
[26:01] but here we're doing nothing
[26:04] I say it for myself
[26:08] um
[26:09] and um Sunday came around and uh my
[26:13] brother Titus preached
[26:17] another amazing preaching Grande
[26:21] um I had my first um you could say a
[26:23] missionary birthday
[26:28] the brothers you know their love Los
[26:31] Hermanos it feels like family you know
[26:34] they got me a cake and everything pastel
[26:37] first time seeing a candle like a
[26:39] fireworks
[26:41] you know it was it was amazing
[26:44] to see their love
[26:47] uh sister knowing me giving me some she
[26:50] makes some bombones and has a happy
[26:52] birthday on it
[26:56] Jose Luis giving me a tie
[27:01] you feel so small
[27:03] you feel their great love for you
[27:07] you see and you know they're you know
[27:11] they were excited
[27:13] but also
[27:15] um
[27:17] there's a lot of Brokenness there but
[27:21] and you see
[27:23] um brothers were telling me and some
[27:25] this is also something that impacts me a
[27:27] lot and
[27:32] um you know things that they're going
[27:33] through
[27:37] um you know family-wise
[27:42] their spouse
[27:44] and you know it's something crazy to
[27:46] think about yes
[27:49] like I'm not married
[27:52] I don't have kids and it's like these
[27:56] brothers coming to tell you yes
[27:59] the problems
[28:01] but all I could do is motivate them
[28:05] that's all we need sometimes is a little
[28:07] motivation
[28:10] they just need to see that
[28:13] you could bring them up
[28:15] I show that you really care for them
[28:19] you're just looking for someone again
[28:24] you see my brother uh our pastor was
[28:28] speaking over there with us a little
[28:29] compartia I believe it was me and my dad
[28:32] and Marshall again
[28:34] you see we were we were like talking
[28:37] about Brokenness
[28:39] and you see uh he was saying you know
[28:42] there's a lot of people broken here
[28:44] he's like I feel the reason why I could
[28:47] help him
[28:49] because we've been broken as well amen
[28:53] you see a broken person could help
[28:55] Another Broken person
[29:04] to try to help them
[29:09] when the devil brings them down
[29:12] that they could get back up
[29:14] and keep going because we have a reward
[29:18] waiting for us
[29:20] you know my brother Pai sang a song over
[29:23] there
[29:24] about receiving a crown up there in
[29:26] heaven but we have to fight foreign
[29:36] comes with suffering and fighting
[29:41] you can't just get something easy
[29:45] because they'll go easy as well amen
[29:48] so we have to fight for that rewards
[29:51] we have to really want it
[29:55] you see on Sunday yeah Domingo our
[29:59] brother um city and our brother
[30:01] um Carlos Carlos City we had to leave
[30:05] then that night or we didn't leave that
[30:07] now we probably left like around three
[30:08] or four
[30:13] because our flight was going to take off
[30:15] at six
[30:18] so we didn't want to live in on Monday
[30:20] morning like we're gonna have to leave
[30:21] at like two in the morning
[30:33] we had a good time with them as well
[30:38] um
[30:39] you know it was very tiring because we
[30:41] only we got to the hotel about 11.
[30:46] now we didn't go to sleep till like one
[30:48] because Marshall kept laughing
[30:52] and he got jealous
[30:56] but no it was and we had to wake up
[30:59] again at uh I think it was 3 40 or
[31:04] because the people told us that we had
[31:06] to be two hours before to get a shuttle
[31:08] yeah
[31:14] so my dad's out the door already
[31:17] because he doesn't want to miss the
[31:19] Shadows
[31:22] are still sleeping
[31:25] so we wake up because he's asked like
[31:27] where's your dad
[31:30] like bro he took off already
[31:33] and so we get ready and we leave
[31:37] and we just waited like come in and the
[31:39] shuttle was already there yes
[31:42] I know I could have slept more like a
[31:45] whole hour more yeah
[31:48] so we get to the airport
[31:50] we're waiting there
[31:54] um we're kind of hungry
[31:56] so we're just waiting there next year
[31:58] you know
[32:00] we're gonna leave at six
[32:03] and they call and say our flight's
[32:05] delayed
[32:08] an hour and 20 minutes
[32:12] so Marshall's frustrated now at this
[32:14] point
[32:16] because he could have slept in his bed
[32:18] still okay
[32:20] but you know it was a good time
[32:24] spending time with Marshall
[32:27] no he's a great guy I look up to him a
[32:30] lot
[32:32] um
[32:33] but no and so then we um
[32:35] we stopped in Tijuana
[32:38] Tijuana and um we
[32:42] um ate some a burrito there
[32:46] um
[32:46] and then we got a cab or like uh a taxi
[32:51] taxi and you know something that really
[32:54] I what I like about Marshalls Marshall
[32:56] could could make a conversation like
[32:58] that yeah okay
[33:03] and this taxi guy he was Hispanic yes
[33:06] and so um you know Marshall started
[33:10] talking to him about the words
[33:15] and uh they started talking about you
[33:18] know Adam and Eve
[33:24] and they started asking them who sinned
[33:27] and I don't know what else is
[33:29] something that I really like what this
[33:32] guy said
[33:33] persona he said see we don't we never
[33:36] want to take the blame for ourselves
[33:40] he said we always either want to blame
[33:42] the devil
[33:43] yeah we want to blame our neighbor
[33:45] alvesino we want to blame God sometimes
[33:49] but we never take the blame of our that
[33:52] what we did we never take you know
[33:54] accounts
[33:58] because well this guy he was a preacher
[34:01] before
[34:03] he knows the word he was taking out
[34:07] scriptures and
[34:09] saying I'm like nothing
[34:12] I was like whoa sombrado because he was
[34:16] he was cussing and saying all this stuff
[34:20] you know when you judge someone too
[34:22] quick
[34:29] and they were kept talking he was saying
[34:33] these things
[34:35] and you see then he started talking
[34:37] about
[34:38] and I and you know we came to a
[34:41] conclusion that you know people are hurt
[34:43] in this world Amen
[34:46] you know he started saying you know
[34:49] because my brother Marshall asked him do
[34:51] you still go to church
[34:53] you know he's like no I used to I used
[34:56] to teach in the churches yeah a contest
[34:58] I should be a great leader
[35:01] but then you know I started seeing
[35:03] people and I started you know seeing bad
[35:07] things happening in the churches
[35:10] you know now I drink my beer
[35:14] you know and I don't care about my
[35:16] testimony
[35:17] testimonial yeah you know and it's sad
[35:19] to see that yes because like how could
[35:22] someone not care about their
[35:38] you see and you know he was saying you
[35:41] know I I drink now yes
[35:44] and I still could help people
[35:47] and it's something that I reflected on
[35:49] yes
[35:50] because you know you don't sometimes you
[35:53] don't really think as a youth is
[35:56] about your testimony amen
[35:59] you don't care what you do
[36:02] you say I could come to God later
[36:05] but you see I just want to motivate you
[36:07] guys
[36:08] you know to make a choice today
[36:11] you know make it as soon as possible
[36:14] because time's running now
[36:16] and you see I want to choose God and I
[36:19] want to have a good testimony
[36:21] I hope you guys want the same
[36:35] God bless you
[36:37] [Applause]
[36:43] yeah
[36:43] bless you Brothers
[36:46] it's a pleasure to be back once again
[36:50] if you see me a little bit more films
[36:52] because I ate a lot of tacos
[37:53] time and time again
[37:56] Primera
[38:56] and I I was able to go the first time
[38:59] I could see how God was working
[39:02] I was a bit doubtful
[39:06] I think we can never put a period
[39:09] we should always put a comment
[39:12] because God continues
[39:14] [Music]
[39:23] my wife went the third time she took my
[39:26] place she was a missionary
[39:32] [Music]
[39:34] sisters were very happy
[39:38] what my wife shares
[39:41] and that's what it's all about brothers
[39:53] I didn't say that it's the last one not
[39:55] the last one that's gonna happen happen
[39:56] but pero
[39:58] Ultima but the last one
[40:00] the final one
[40:03] and I was able to say
[40:06] what God was doing
[40:09] you understand me right
[40:18] now I was able to see how God was
[40:21] working
[40:27] I want to share with you I'm very happy
[40:31] that the contract
[40:35] you can say that the pastors
[40:56] to make that possible foreign
[41:30] foreign
[41:51] [Music]
[41:57] corruption but he that sowed to the
[42:00] spirit shall the spirit reap life
[42:01] Everlasting
[42:04] foreign
[42:14] verse 10 says like this as we have
[42:16] therefore opportunity let us do good
[42:18] unto all men especially unto them who
[42:20] are of the household of faith
[42:27] is
[42:35] to serve one of us
[42:40] um
[43:39] when you don't see anything foreign
[45:06] foreign
[45:38] uh
[45:39] Los pies de dios meant to be the feet of
[45:42] God
[45:43] to be the hands of God
[45:45] used to be the eyes of God
[45:48] the mouth of God
[45:51] is very easy
[45:55] to get the skirts
[46:02] everything is possible everything is
[46:05] possible God everything is possible it's
[46:09] worth it
[46:11] every minute of our time
[46:16] [Music]
[46:30] a very simple message
[46:36] and I've seen him preach very
[46:38] tremendously foreign
[46:54] [Applause]
[48:10] no I don't tell you this tomorrow
[49:14] and then
[49:34] and we decide to do it
[49:48] Hermanos
[51:34] Jesus said these things would happen
[51:38] and we're looking at them today
[51:43] oh brother one of these days these
[51:46] things are going to change
[51:57] it's here
[52:01] I see Eve go over and Shake It
[52:04] Ultimo
[52:22] on down
[52:25] on down to the last one
[52:28] when Jesus comes again
[52:33] and the Earth will break forward
[52:54] this is true
[52:57] that God is moving
[53:01] but he needs for me
[53:10] not to deceive myself
[53:14] but this this this
[53:18] makes me be more cautious
[53:21] decision is then
[54:22] Brothers
[54:37] I encourage you
[54:39] that it's worth it
[54:42] to serve our God
[54:45] and to serve our God is to serve our
[54:49] brothers
[54:51] is
[54:54] a decision
[55:01] [Music]
[55:12] God bless you
[55:18] [Applause]
[55:21] yeah
[55:23] if you can open your scripture with me
[55:27] and stand for a moment
[55:30] First Corinthians
[55:35] from verse 4 to verse 7.
[55:39] we send greetings to our brothers
[55:43] Mexico
[55:45] with his family amen
[56:20] does not behave itself unseemly seeketh
[56:23] not her own is not easily provoked
[56:25] thinketh no evil
[56:38] birth all things believeth all things
[56:40] hope is all things endureth all things
[56:44] you may be Siri
[56:47] in this missionary trip yeah
[56:58] I believe when you're in the work of God
[57:00] you're working for God
[57:05] you always expect for greater things
[57:07] from God
[57:09] I've always believed
[57:13] while you work for God
[57:17] you do it with the right reasons
[57:21] I believe God will always
[57:27] what you have uh which is
[57:32] many times we don't receive what we want
[57:35] because we don't have the right reason
[57:37] amen amen
[57:40] so on this trip
[57:44] for me it was something very special
[57:47] I could see the brothers
[57:52] and see how God is working over there
[57:58] I like to get into the history of what a
[58:01] place is
[58:09] so speaking with the brother in the
[58:11] previous time we went uh
[58:20] I wanted to know a little of the history
[58:22] of Uruapan
[58:25] um
[58:27] like this and also the history on the
[58:30] congregation there it was uh
[58:33] and they tell wonderful things
[58:39] they talk about the the good times
[58:45] got around 100 or 200 people congregated
[58:48] but I mean with us is
[58:51] for me that's a very big group
[58:56] and we see where they are now uh
[59:00] and this time we went uh
[59:05] um I could see the fruits
[59:10] of what is is happening there the uh
[59:15] and for me it's something special
[59:18] to see that
[59:23] see how the brothers say that how they
[59:25] good they treat us is
[1:00:23] still making more room for God to give
[1:00:26] me more it's okay girl that's what I
[1:00:28] believe
[1:00:31] okay
[1:00:33] so I go and I believe we should go with
[1:00:35] that mentality
[1:00:37] you might say
[1:00:39] well I don't go anywhere
[1:00:41] well then give it all here
[1:00:44] if you can't go out there
[1:00:47] if all you can here
[1:00:50] because we also need some here
[1:00:55] um
[1:00:59] an image from this trip
[1:01:02] um
[1:01:08] this image stands out the most of this
[1:01:11] last entire trip we made
[1:01:16] was when a child named Josue is
[1:01:22] um
[1:01:25] and I believe the brother's name is
[1:01:27] Daniel kamarena
[1:01:32] one of his sons they wanted to sing a
[1:01:35] special yeah
[1:01:37] and the boy is three years old yeah
[1:01:42] if you would have seen his face
[1:01:48] how he rejoice
[1:01:52] when he sang to God
[1:01:54] um
[1:02:07] because I saw him
[1:02:11] and I saw an image of the church where
[1:02:14] they are
[1:02:16] a church that has been restored
[1:02:19] that is
[1:02:44] so this young fellow can have hope
[1:02:47] without forgetting that there were some
[1:02:52] support
[1:03:02] that are still there
[1:03:05] and I believe they still love God
[1:03:09] and their Elders already
[1:03:14] and as you're growing old uh
[1:03:17] I can imagine
[1:03:21] but you don't see that you can
[1:04:04] they might not see the fruits
[1:04:09] um
[1:04:10] like let's see a person and and to um
[1:04:16] because I believe God has greater things
[1:04:18] for them
[1:04:20] I hope they can see it is
[1:04:45] because when you love someone
[1:04:48] you can bear Brothers
[1:04:52] you
[1:04:55] understand
[1:04:58] what it means to bear or endure uh
[1:05:04] you might feel you can't stand it
[1:05:06] anymore
[1:05:07] but when you love them
[1:05:42] you understand me
[1:05:46] but even then
[1:05:49] you still keep loving that person
[1:05:52] and you're with them there
[1:05:55] believe the brothers
[1:05:58] have taught me
[1:06:00] what it is to love God
[1:06:03] what it means to love God
[1:06:08] when the time is cold
[1:06:11] when there is loneliness
[1:06:13] a time of tribulation
[1:06:16] in time of rejection
[1:06:19] and type of mockery an independent
[1:06:22] examples and different types of times
[1:06:27] various conditions
[1:06:32] what it truly means to love God
[1:06:35] because they are still there
[1:06:39] devil has wanted to do what he wants but
[1:06:42] he's not able to support
[1:06:44] because love prevails love continues
[1:06:51] it should be for every one of us
[1:06:55] that's why many times people Retreat
[1:07:00] now speaking on the the taxi driver
[1:07:04] God bless him
[1:07:07] oh
[1:07:09] you know quiero I don't want albondia
[1:07:11] one day
[1:07:15] [Music]
[1:07:19] just like he said like he didn't go to
[1:07:21] church because of too many people
[1:07:23] or too many Hypocrites
[1:07:26] that's why he didn't go and to church
[1:07:30] I don't want that to be my story
[1:07:34] to say
[1:07:37] maybe there was Hypocrites
[1:07:40] but no Hypocrites
[1:07:43] will separate me from God
[1:07:51] no rejections
[1:08:00] from the love of God amen amen
[1:08:05] that's why I'm still standing here
[1:08:32] I want to read a quote from the prophet
[1:08:51] I would rather have a church that knows
[1:08:53] nothing about any spiritual
[1:08:55] gifts
[1:08:58] and just be so in love with each other
[1:09:01] and with Christ
[1:09:06] I'd rather have that than any than every
[1:09:10] spiritual gift operating in church
[1:09:13] skip down a few sins it is
[1:09:18] where there is gifts they'll bring
[1:09:21] confusion
[1:09:24] where there oh forgive me where there is
[1:09:26] gifts they can be questioned but where
[1:09:28] there is love it's perfect it is perfect
[1:09:31] that's what's correct that's correct
[1:09:33] that's right
[1:09:35] and if you had perfect love
[1:09:38] usted
[1:09:39] you'd have perfect gifts yes that's
[1:09:41] what's correct that's right
[1:09:44] so work first with love
[1:09:47] that brings fellowship
[1:09:50] and fellowship brings gifts
[1:09:53] I've been able to see
[1:09:55] how God has been working and
[1:09:59] the small groups amen amen
[1:10:05] if God has given our pastor great vision
[1:10:09] [Music]
[1:10:11] I believe the work he is doing
[1:11:05] nothing can stop us
[1:11:12] when the service ended

[1:11:59] but I've never been to a service like
[1:12:02] this one this is
[1:12:03] this service was good
[1:12:08] and I can see
