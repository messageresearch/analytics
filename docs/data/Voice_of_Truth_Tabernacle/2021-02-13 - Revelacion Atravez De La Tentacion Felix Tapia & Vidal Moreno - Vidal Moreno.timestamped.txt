[17:11] but but you will be tempted above and ye
[17:14] are able to
[17:22] temptation also should make a way to
[17:25] escape
[17:27] that ye may be able to bear it
[17:35] and then we go to john
[17:39] chapter 15 verse 13.
[17:42] juan capitolo versus

[19:02] i may not know them but you know them
[19:04] lord
[19:06] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[19:07] amen
[19:21] i had a couple weeks to meditate
[19:26] he gave us the schedule like three weeks
[19:28] four weeks out
[19:34] and and i was i was thinking of what
[19:35] should i speak about josh
[19:39] because the team that we're having right
[19:41] now is being prepared for temptation
[19:43] right
[19:48] and the title that me and brother vidal
[19:50] have chosen
[20:03] and and as i was thinking
[20:07] i was like what should i what should i
[20:10] talk about
[20:15] um we know we we already know that that
[20:18] drugs brings us temptations and so forth
[20:24] so i was asking god what should i talk
[20:26] about
[20:29] and and and as i was thinking i was i
[20:32] was thinking
[20:36] i was he gave me
[20:40] choose your friends wisely
[20:49] you know because sometimes you know we
[20:51] we meet people in life
[20:56] and they could be in our lives for the
[20:57] long run
[21:01] and you could build a good bond and a
[21:03] friendship with them
[21:08] and you could you could do good things
[21:09] with them yes
[21:11] you know there's a lot of great
[21:13] friendships
[21:15] here at church i have a lot of great
[21:17] friendships
[21:19] you know we all have a lot of great
[21:22] friendships amongst each other
[21:26] but then sometimes we meet friends
[21:43] i was reading an article the other day
[21:47] of why why people go through certain
[21:50] temptations
[21:55] especially the young adults and people
[21:58] in high school and in middle school
[22:06] and and and i i was reading through it
[22:08] yes
[22:10] and and one thing that caught my
[22:11] attention
[22:14] it said that the reason why certain
[22:16] people want to dress a certain way
[22:23] yes it's because porque they want to fit
[22:26] in with the group that they're hanging
[22:28] out with
[22:31] identification you know
[22:35] you know if you hang out with gang
[22:36] members uh
[22:40] you know eventually you'll become a gang
[22:42] member
[22:46] you know if if you hang out with people
[22:48] that just a party all the time
[22:53] you know you're always going to be
[22:54] partying all the time
[22:57] you know because you you always go in
[23:00] into what they're doing
[23:04] you know and the reason we go there
[23:19] you know we put ourselves in that
[23:21] atmosphere
[23:23] you know if we hang out with people that
[23:25] do drugs all the time
[23:29] we go into those we fall into those
[23:31] temptations
[23:34] you know we fall into those drug habits
[23:38] you know sometimes we say oh i'm not
[23:40] going to be i'm not going to do it
[23:45] you know and me you know growing up in
[23:47] the world
[23:55] i've been on the side where i'm the one
[23:57] that that
[23:58] that's around doing certain things and
[24:00] there's people around me that are not
[24:01] doing it
[24:26] where there's people that that are doing
[24:28] certain drugs that i've never done
[24:33] and you know i used to promise myself
[24:37] when i was a little boy there i would
[24:39] never do that
[24:44] but you know i was around it so much
[24:49] you know i i was always there around
[24:51] those people
[24:54] that i eventually fell into those things
[24:59] you know that's why we should be careful
[25:01] on who we hang out with
[25:05] we should be careful on who we open up
[25:12] because they said you know what you you
[25:14] want to hang out with us come on
[25:19] you know and and and then sometimes they
[25:21] see us
[25:23] nose van you know we dress differently
[25:30] and little by little they start telling
[25:32] you you know what maybe you should just
[25:33] dress like this
[25:38] you know maybe you should come and hang
[25:40] out at the party
[25:42] vegas fiesta or just come and hang out
[25:45] with us
[25:48] you know all we're celebrating here take
[25:50] this drink
[25:53] you know those are little things that
[25:56] eventually the enemy tries to come in
[25:58] and do essa
[26:02] and we've got to overcome those
[26:04] temptations
[26:07] you know what's one way we can over we
[26:09] can avoid those temptations
[26:13] you know and i shared this before
[26:16] but i i want to share it again

[26:32] following
[26:51] it no lager
[26:55] you know there's sometimes people that
[26:56] won't understand you

[27:02] that understands us
[27:05] and his name is the lord jesus christ

[36:22] are the issues of life
[36:38] when we talk about a temptation
[36:42] you know there there's something that
[36:44] that that uh
[36:45] that is revealed to us through
[36:47] temptation
[36:52] i don't believe god would allow
[36:53] temptation
[36:56] you know if it didn't reveal something
[36:58] to us
[37:00] you know there's things that that we are
[37:03] completely unaware of
[37:08] we're not aware of within ourselves
[37:11] than nosotros but you know when when uh
[37:14] temptation comes
[37:18] it begins to reveal things that are
[37:20] within your heart
[37:24] you see things that that you you
[37:26] wouldn't know if temptation uh
[37:28] um didn't come uh
[37:33] it reveals it reveals uh you know the
[37:36] the good or the bad in you
[37:39] you know that's what temptation does
[37:41] it's okay
[37:43] that's one of the things that it will do
[37:46] but temptation
[37:54] [Music]
[37:58] you know it entices you know to to your
[38:00] hopes and and your desires
[38:16] and you know that's that's what we want
[38:17] to know
[38:20] you see that's that's what that's what i
[38:21] want to know
[38:23] you know where where do i find pleasure
[38:27] you see where where does the youth of
[38:29] voice of truth tabernacle find their
[38:30] pleasure
[38:57] is not bad
[39:05] that's what my question is for for the
[39:07] youth and everybody here this evening
[39:12] where do you find
[39:39] you know i have another question
[39:42] you know your pleasure
[39:48] do you find it in god
[39:52] do you find it in the presence of god
[40:08] in serving god encounters
[40:11] or do you find it somewhere else
[40:14] you see because i see a lot of times
[40:18] you see where we'll be here in church
[40:21] and you look like you're having
[40:22] absolutely no pleasure
[40:25] see we can have a bible study and we'll
[40:26] complain about how long it is
[40:31] but we can sit there and watch netflix
[40:33] and not say a word
[40:50] all we
[41:04] and that's
[41:32] like you know if you want to if you want
[41:34] to go ahead and go into pleasure
[41:38] up before pain
[41:42] i didn't expect more pain
[41:45] because the first pleasure
[41:49] that that that um that evil um that that
[41:52] evil
[41:54] what she did okay
[42:00] you know it created more pain
[42:04] what what did it create it created a
[42:08] created cane
[42:09] vino that that that
[42:13] that's what came out of that first
[42:14] pleasure
[42:26] brought more pain to his mother
[42:56] is what the
[43:09] in his heart that he would not defile
[43:13] himself with the portions of the king's
[43:15] meat no contaminants
[43:18] nor with the wine which he drank
[43:22] therefore he requested the prince of the
[43:25] eunuchs that he might
[43:26] not defile himself
[43:31] you see it was purpose in daniel's heart
[43:36] you know not necessarily in his mind
[43:51] you know and that's what we need to make
[43:53] sure that we do yes
[43:57] you know make sure it's settled in our
[43:58] hearts
[44:02] you know that we not defile ourselves
[44:06] did we not
[44:09] [Music]
[44:25] luke 22 28 lucas venti dos vintiocho
[44:31] and i just want to kind of go over some
[44:35] things
[44:40] it reads like this this scene you know
[44:43] it's talking about about peter here or
[44:45] about the disciples
[44:48] you know and and it and the disciples
[44:51] are talking with jesus
[44:55] you see and and and jesus says these
[44:57] words to peter
[44:58] jesus well to his disciples excuse me
[45:07] [Music]
[45:15] as my father hath appointed
[45:32] and the lord said simon simon senor
[45:36] behold satan had desire to have you that
[45:38] he may sift you as wheat
[45:44] he says but i have prayed for thee that
[45:47] dies
[45:48] of faith of fail not bro
[45:52] and when they are converted strengthen
[45:54] thy brethren
[45:58] you see
[46:24] you know the reading of the scriptures
[46:40] and you know i i like that
[46:44] you know because they were with him in
[46:46] his time of difficulty
[46:50] in the time of the test
[46:53] they were with jesus
[47:09] pray for thee that thy faith fail
[47:12] not no fault you see so you have you
[47:15] continue with jesus in the temptation
[47:18] [Music]
[47:20] will he leave you in yours lord
[47:49] it wasn't just anybody that was praying
[47:51] for him
[47:55] so when you go through temptations
[47:59] as as as jesus was telling peter jesus
[48:04] because peter jesus was telling peter
[48:06] jesus
[48:08] he was giving him a warning he was
[48:11] letting him know
[48:12] that the satan was going to come after
[48:14] him
[48:17] after peter
[48:45] but you know you know how it is you know
[48:47] when we see peter joseph
[48:50] later on lego you know he he he
[48:54] he just he's just in himself el esta and
[48:57] and sue said
[48:58] you know in his being he's just you know
[49:00] he's just very boastful and sus esta
[49:04] very arrogant you know he's like you
[49:07] know what
[49:08] don't worry about me
[49:13] i got this
[49:27] he had his strengths elton
[49:42] this is one thing you know when
[49:44] temptation comes it reveals to us as
[49:46] well
[49:49] you know it reveals to us our weaknesses
[49:51] and our strengths
[49:56] amen amen you know i got a quote here
[49:58] from uh brother branham thank you
[50:02] and you know he says this elise in the
[50:04] message jesus christ the same yesterday
[50:06] today and forever
[50:10] he says when moses come out from his
[50:13] 40-day fast up on the mountain
[50:18] where he had the two tables of stone
[50:23] satan tempted him at his weak spots
[50:27] that was his temper
[50:31] and he threw down the commandments and
[50:33] broke them
[50:36] it says but when satan met the lord
[50:38] jesus
[51:01] the bible says that there was no man on
[51:03] the face of the earth
[51:34] of
[52:03] you see i'm going to be uh shifting
[52:04] gears now
[52:09] but you know we we we see as well
[52:14] we see another man by the name of
[52:16] abraham
[52:18] you know he was the father of the face
[52:22] and his greatest strength was faith
[52:28] that that was his greatest strength
[52:43] when he went down to egypt
[52:47] you know and they they started looking
[52:49] at his wife
[52:52] you know they just desired her own
[52:55] you know and he he right away he didn't
[52:58] trust
[52:58] his faith failed him
[53:03] and you know and he lied he meant dior
[53:05] you see this was his strengths
[53:09] you see so the devil you know he she's
[53:12] gonna come at you
[53:13] and tons of zelda no matter how strong
[53:15] you think you are
[53:18] you know where where you think your
[53:20] strengths are oh don't know
[53:22] who said that you see he's coming after
[53:24] you
[53:25] he's he's not gonna stop and this is
[53:29] exactly what he did with peter
[53:32] you see that peter was a brave man
[53:36] if somebody was brave it was peter
[53:39] pedro you see when
[53:53] [Music]
[54:08] until they pointed them out
[54:11] and they said this is one of his
[54:12] disciples
[54:16] you see it was his strengths
[54:20] but even in his own strength he was
[54:21] unable to
[54:50] not because david was not supposed to be
[54:53] there
[54:55] he was not supposed to be on the roof
[54:59] he was just you know up there just
[55:00] chilling
[55:03] he was just relaxing and you know that's
[55:06] what happened that's what's happened to
[55:08] many of
[55:08] us yes we just relax
[55:16] is in battle yeah
[55:32] i got this
[55:35] [Applause]
[55:58] because he was in the wrong place
[56:27] it reveals our insufficiencies
[56:41] just wait a little bit
[58:05] see what works
[58:18] amen amen
[58:39] and i think that uh you know uh daniel
[58:42] and the three young hebrews
[58:46] they were
[58:50] very uh capable men
[58:55] uh you know the the greatest thing about
[58:57] it was that
[58:58] they were very uh prepared man
[59:05] uh you know and i believe it's it was
[59:08] the reason that they were very prepared
[59:11] and very capable
[59:14] [Music]
[59:15] it was because god had prepared them
[59:20] you see uh these they had been taken
[59:22] captive
[59:26] and taken to a far away country
[59:40] things weren't weren't the same you know
[59:43] like they were back at home
[59:47] and casa but yeah and you know there's
[59:50] as many times in our lives
[59:54] where you know we ask uh we ask why did
[59:57] this happen to me okay
[1:00:01] you know why would god allow this
[1:00:07] esto oh you know and i as a young man i
[1:00:09] ask myself a lot of that question a lot
[1:00:11] of times
[1:00:20] why would god allow something like this
[1:00:25] you know i think it's a very common
[1:00:26] question among the youths
[1:00:30] you see why this why that
[1:00:34] but you know your question will come you
[1:00:36] know it will be answered in due time
[1:00:40] you know
[1:01:18] then you'll have a good attitude
[1:01:22] you see if
[1:01:34] that plan is gonna be revealed
[1:01:50] no matter what circumstances you are put
[1:01:52] in
[1:01:53] no important question what circumstances
[1:01:57] it could be a terrible circumstance
[1:02:02] but god is trying to show the devil
[1:02:17] sons and daughters of god
[1:02:32] they were not conformed no second
[1:02:34] formatting
[1:02:35] to do the the traditions of of the
[1:02:38] babylon
[1:02:39] alas you see they were these
[1:02:42] these young men estos they were the
[1:02:45] cream of the crop
[1:02:50] they were the best of the best
[1:02:53] and i believe that that's what's sitting
[1:02:55] in front of me this evening
[1:03:00] i'm not gonna
[1:03:14] because he has a job
[1:03:42] many times
[1:03:49] we get conformed to uh you know the
[1:03:51] things of of the world
[1:03:55] you know and and you know that's not
[1:03:58] what we're supposed to do
[1:04:01] and you know what daniel had proposed in
[1:04:03] his heart
[1:04:07] and the three young hebrews i believe
[1:04:09] they had the same attitude
[1:04:17] they would not be like the rest of them
[1:04:21] that they would overcome any temptation
[1:04:23] that came their way
[1:04:34] the temptation was all over the place
[1:04:38] and you know
[1:05:05] they were told to bow down
[1:05:19] they were just as respectful as they
[1:05:20] could be to the king
[1:05:24] they were sarcastic sarcastic
[1:05:27] you know they weren't smart alex about
[1:05:29] it they weren't smart alex
[1:05:34] you know they weren't like they didn't
[1:05:36] answer him in any kind of way
[1:05:40] you know these young men didn't estos
[1:05:44] you know it's just funny you know that
[1:05:47] a lot of times you know our kids we we
[1:05:49] don't like the way they answer us
[1:05:55] you know they may be sarcastic or smart
[1:05:57] alex
[1:06:02] my question is where did they get it
[1:06:06] oh you know where where did they get
[1:06:07] their sarcasm
[1:06:10] where are they where did they get their
[1:06:12] smart alignment from don
[1:06:16] todo
[1:06:28] but these young men you know
[1:06:33] you know in closing you know these these
[1:06:35] young men would not bow down
[1:06:40] you see that they they said they would
[1:06:41] not do it
[1:06:43] and you know the thing of it is
[1:06:47] is that you know they were like you can
[1:06:49] do what you want to do
[1:06:52] you know our god our god he is able to
[1:06:56] deliver us
[1:07:12] you know he
[1:07:39] through every age he's heating
[1:07:53] you know but it didn't matter to them
[1:07:57] it didn't matter that it was seven times
[1:07:59] harder
[1:08:02] you don't matter what age we're in no
[1:08:04] important
[1:08:06] just keep heating it up devil
