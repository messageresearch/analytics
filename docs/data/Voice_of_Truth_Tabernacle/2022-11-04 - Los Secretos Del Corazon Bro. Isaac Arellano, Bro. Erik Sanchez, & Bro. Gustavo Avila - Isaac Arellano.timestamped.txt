[22:53] and thank him for giving us the strength
[22:56] gracias hey man I hope you're all doing
[22:59] good
[23:01] our title for this night is
[23:05] the secrets of the heart is Los secretos
[23:09] and we'll be reading there in judges 14
[23:12] 14.
[23:16] and when you have you can say Amen
[23:22] and I'm gonna be focusing
[23:25] if you know what we're gonna read it's a
[23:27] riddleston
[23:30] Enigma and riddles have a lot of
[23:33] meanings
[23:37] significados but I want to focus on one
[23:41] of them
[23:43] and the scripture of God reads
[23:47] and he said unto them out of the ear
[23:50] came forth meat and out of the strong
[23:53] came forth sweetness
[24:00] and they could not in three days expound
[24:03] the riddle is
[24:08] bow our heads and let us pray
[24:12] Heavenly Father pares
[24:20] take over my mind over my lips
[24:24] or may only you be speaking
[24:28] and may you also be with my brother
[24:31] Fidel and my brother Eric
[24:37] Glory and Honor be for you
[24:41] glorious amen Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[24:44] amen
[24:46] amen you may be seated
[24:51] uh we've heard our brothers already
[24:54] preach on Samson yeah
[24:57] we heard our brother Enoch
[25:00] we heard our brother Hector our brother
[25:02] blast
[25:04] and they all share how they relate to
[25:07] Samson
[25:11] and I also identify with Samson
[25:15] the same way they did
[25:19] I know they went after something they
[25:21] were not supposed to
[25:23] see
[25:26] and so I don't repeat my story I'm sure
[25:29] you all know it already
[25:33] and it's very similar yes but I want to
[25:37] focus on this riddle tonight
[25:41] now in this story of Samson
[25:45] is about victory
[25:48] Victoria and victimhood the
[25:56] we see that Samson is victorious
[26:00] victorious killing 1 000 Philistines
[26:05] he's tough and strong
[26:11] and that's only one side of his life
[26:17] just like we can be only tough and
[26:20] strong on one side of our life
[26:23] is
[26:26] Samson's story is about strength
[26:32] an embarrassing weakness
[26:38] from Force
[26:46] does that sound like anyone's life
[26:51] that's how I've been sometimes
[26:54] I've been up Estados and I've been down
[26:58] amen amen now we've been in the gospel
[27:01] long enough
[27:03] or maybe in the message long enough
[27:08] to know that we can walk in victory
[27:12] Victoria in one area of our lives
[27:20] and another area of Our Lives
[27:24] you could have victory in church
[27:27] Victorian like let's be a victim in your
[27:30] home
[27:32] you know uh TD Jake said TD Jakes dijo
[27:36] you can have a PhD
[27:39] on a
[27:41] and have credit so bad
[27:47] that you can't even pay attention can
[27:50] can this attention amen
[27:54] little little comical for you
[27:57] credit is so bad you can't pay attention
[28:00] brother
[28:02] I don't know how to translate
[28:08] amen but it's amazing
[28:12] how Samsung is strong enough
[28:18] to defeat a Philistines with a Jawbone
[28:24] but he couldn't put up with a crying
[28:27] woman for seven days
[28:33] and that was just Samsung's case
[28:38] what is our case
[28:40] there's sides of us that are also
[28:43] vulnerable okay
[28:49] the Devil beats us
[28:54] foreign
[29:54] system the scripture says that he came
[29:56] under the spirit of the Lord
[30:02] when he defeated the lion
[30:06] but on his way back
[30:10] the spirit of the Lord was not with him
[30:14] so he touched that dead body
[30:18] now Samson did this is
[30:21] after he was filled with the Holy Spirit
[30:27] and this just shows yes that an
[30:31] outpouring
[30:33] of the Holy Ghost
[30:35] not automatically makes a person godlier
[30:42] I'm gonna repeat it and outpouring of
[30:46] the Holy Spirit
[31:17] and a person can be wonderfully gifted
[31:20] by the Holy Spirit
[31:24] In other words the Holy Spirit can come
[31:27] over someone
[31:30] and after
[31:33] so be spiritually immature
[31:38] spiritual do we understand that
[31:41] he was filled with the Holy Spirit
[31:46] and he just proved it provoked that he
[31:49] was immature to his
[31:52] vowelto amen amen now I want you to
[31:56] think about all the lions that have
[31:58] tried to kill you
[32:03] because Samsung was on his way to a
[32:05] wedding
[32:08] and who's ever gotten married here on
[32:11] your way you don't think to fight a lion
[32:13] he is
[32:17] nobody thinks the father lying going to
[32:20] get married amen
[32:23] but here this lion did it wait for
[32:26] Samson to be ready
[32:29] just like the devil is not waiting for
[32:32] us to be ready
[32:35] you know the Lions have tried to kill us
[32:38] in our lives
[32:41] the line of depression
[32:44] the line of grief
[32:48] of fear of death the more of Trouble
[32:53] they
[33:39] and you don't fight so you don't plan to
[33:42] fight on your way to get married amen
[33:50] amen that's why we say porreso de simos
[33:54] when when somebody says why are you like
[33:57] this
[33:59] why why are you so defensive defensivo
[34:04] and this and and they say yes
[34:08] that's that's why I got scars
[34:15] on my heart
[34:17] because the line jumped out
[34:22] that's why I overreact but says
[34:27] because a lion jumped out
[34:32] that's why I'm so offended
[34:36] because a line jumped out
[34:40] there's some people in this room
[34:43] that don't understand
[34:46] the way they are
[34:49] sometimes I don't understand the way I
[34:51] am
[34:53] because so many lions have jumped at me
[34:56] out of nowhere
[35:00] when when always
[35:04] people
[35:05] forgive me we're always
[35:08] I don't know if you if this is you you
[35:10] know but we go about our lives
[35:16] ready to throw down
[35:21] you know we're ready we're half locked
[35:24] and loaded all the time
[35:28] yeah we're we're always looking
[35:32] we're always looking behind our shoulder
[35:34] uh
[35:36] we're walking in the trees in the bushes
[35:42] waiting for the next lion to jump out
[35:45] Esperanto cuando
[35:48] you know and and that's how we that's
[35:51] that's that's not good yes correct to
[35:54] always be watching your back
[35:58] and I want to leave that up to God Amen
[36:01] so
[36:04] yes I'm in
[36:07] I wanna
[36:09] I wanna point something out
[36:13] and I'm closing already
[36:16] that killing a lion empty-handed
[36:22] is no easy thing
[36:25] but killing a lion can be done is
[36:56] he was bare-handed
[37:00] he didn't have nothing in his hands
[37:03] God is going to give us
[37:06] the victory against our lion La
[37:09] Victorian Contra and Western tell your
[37:12] neighbor
[37:13] I'm gonna do it bare-handed
[37:18] we cannot be laid-back people no
[37:21] problemos
[37:22] who let the lion come in
[37:26] and destroy us
[37:29] destroy our youth this through youngest
[37:31] to his Holiness even our elders
[37:34] sometimes our elders are going at it
[37:40] the devil's coming against all of us
[37:47] bare-handed Warriors somos Guerreros but
[37:51] so bare-handed Warriors
[37:53] Guerreros is what God wants
[37:59] you know you don't need a lot in your
[38:01] hands
[38:03] you don't need the advantages that your
[38:06] brother has
[38:09] the spirit of God to come in
[38:14] and Samsung did it with his bare hands
[38:19] even though the odds are against us
[38:25] we need to fight back
[38:28] even if their teeth are bigger
[38:32] even if their claws are longer
[38:36] fight back to the youth you need to
[38:41] fight back
[38:45] insecure because
[39:03] because if you don't fight back
[39:07] it's gonna kill you
[39:10] and you'll be dead for a while
[39:14] until you start fighting back again
[39:18] fight it back or it'll kill you
[39:23] because the answer to this riddle
[39:27] respuesta is
[39:31] that the bigger the fight is
[39:35] the sweeter the honey bad mazdul say is
[39:39] the bigger the fight
[39:43] the stronger the fights
[39:45] the stronger the trials
[39:49] you know go back to the place that
[39:51] almost killed you
[39:54] go back to that place I almost left you
[39:57] for dead
[40:00] and take that honey from there
[40:19] [Applause]
[40:24] God bless you
[40:28] [Applause]
[40:42] thank you
[40:46] Hermanos
[40:50] very tremendous message from our brother
[40:52] Isaac
[40:56] is
[40:59] now if you can follow me to the Book of
[41:01] Judges chapter 16.
[41:05] we're going to be reading verses 15 and
[41:08] 16. this is 17.
[41:11] what's this disease Judges chapter 16
[41:15] 15 17.
[41:34] and she said unto him how can thou say I
[41:37] love thee when thine heart is not with
[41:38] me thus mock me these three times and
[41:40] has not told me we're in thy great
[41:42] strength life
[41:45] hijo
[41:49] es foreign
[42:07] there hath not come a razor upon my head
[42:10] for I have been a Nazarite unto God for
[42:12] my mother's womb if I be shaving then my
[42:14] strength will go for me and I shall
[42:16] become weak and be like any other man
[42:19] in
[42:21] a second scripture in Deuteronomy
[42:23] chapter 29 verse 29.
[42:27] Deuteronomy 29 29.
[42:30] Australia
[42:35] Nosotros is
[42:42] the secret things belong unto the Lord
[42:44] Our God but those things which are
[42:46] revealed belong unto us and to our
[42:48] children forever that we may do all the
[42:50] work the words of this law amen
[42:54] the blessings
[42:57] the secrets of the heart
[43:01] and look it's a secret is very important
[43:04] Isaac our brother Isaac
[43:08] with this scripture about this riddle
[43:20] to his first wife
[43:24] and it would later cost Sampson
[43:29] to go and get 30 linen garments
[43:35] and 30 of feast outfits or garments
[44:03] I would have liked to have been born in
[44:05] a home that had advantages
[44:09] to be born in home with advantages is to
[44:13] have a loving father
[44:15] a mother that shows a lot of affection
[44:19] grandparents that love you
[44:21] and possible economic opportunities
[44:26] perhaps a good home a house you know
[44:30] they say and one says or you say I
[44:33] didn't have all that
[44:35] but even even uh even besides all that I
[44:40] want to
[44:40] I'm still here standing
[44:44] in La Vida in life
[44:48] in the life of this man named Samson
[44:52] he had a very home with a lot of
[44:54] advantages
[44:59] he had all the love from his parents
[45:02] economically
[45:04] I imagine he didn't like anything
[45:08] a good example of parents spiritually
[45:15] an exceptional pair of parents that were
[45:19] connected to God
[45:22] and look apart from all that
[45:27] Samson was a was a son that was
[45:31] a desired child
[45:34] because his mother his mother was
[45:36] sterile
[45:38] she couldn't have children
[45:42] so I imagine that when she receives the
[45:44] news
[45:45] that she was going to be a mother
[45:48] how happy that woman must have became
[45:51] to the degree
[45:54] that she desire the moment for Samson to
[45:57] be born
[45:58] as our Pastor said last Friday
[46:05] was a very privileged man
[46:09] and not only that
[46:11] spiritual but in the spiritual dios God
[46:15] Elijah God chooses
[46:18] from his birth and he sets him apart for
[46:23] his service
[46:25] he sets him apart away
[46:27] in a special way
[46:30] to the point that he's a Nazarene
[46:33] from his birth right
[46:37] now look
[46:40] everything was going well
[46:43] Sanson Sampson
[46:46] said
[46:48] he made any kind of error
[46:51] differences he got involved with
[46:53] different women
[46:54] he got close to a dead body or a dead a
[46:57] carcass
[46:59] and he he lied but
[47:03] even then God was with him
[47:06] God was with him
[47:22] the secret that God had given him
[47:25] that no no razor no knife
[47:28] could come across the locks of his hair
[47:32] and that's where God
[47:34] up to a certain point abandons him
[47:39] he revealed because he opened up his
[47:43] heart to the wrong person
[47:50] he reveals secrets to them
[47:53] that are for yourself
[47:56] they're personal
[48:30] to the first person you meet in downtown
[48:33] Alex
[48:46] dios God reveals
[48:52] secrets to his children
[48:57] God doesn't reveal his secrets to the
[49:00] whole world look
[49:05] even the disciples
[49:08] they ask the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:15] why do you speak to us in Parables
[49:17] the Lord responded to them
[49:23] because you it's made known to you the
[49:26] the Mysteries
[49:27] and it's not given to them
[49:30] do you see look
[49:34] I want to get to this point
[49:36] this is what I'm getting at
[49:39] secretos
[49:45] or God looks at who he shares his
[49:47] secrets with dios God
[49:50] is careful
[49:52] of who he shares the secrets with look a
[49:56] young Kinesis in Genesis
[50:00] he told the woman in the serpentine
[50:05] between your seat and her seat
[50:09] she her Offspring will bruise your head
[50:14] [Music]
[50:16] in other words
[50:25] a messiah
[50:28] and the devil was waiting for him
[50:33] but he didn't know exactly how it was
[50:35] going to come but that right
[50:39] when the Lord Jesus when they crucify
[50:42] him
[50:44] the devil wasn't sure if it was him or
[50:47] if it wasn't him
[50:53] people beat you you do nothing
[50:59] he didn't know for certain that if it
[51:02] was yeah he thought
[51:05] that he was just another prophet
[51:08] the Lord Jesus
[51:13] Goes to Hell
[51:16] the devil tells him
[51:20] he tells him I thought I had you when I
[51:25] killed Adam when I killed Moses
[51:28] but look here you are now
[52:15] that he was God himself
[52:24] is the mystery of God revealed
[52:28] do you see how God hides things
[52:32] to other types of people
[52:35] but to his children he reveals it to
[52:37] them
[52:42] when he says
[52:46] that woman at the well
[52:55] you're the son of the Living God
[53:00] he only reveals it to his children look
[53:03] youth
[53:04] yes
[53:06] reveals
[53:08] he's in his word
[53:12] and when God reveals something to you
[53:16] keep it in your heart
[53:18] don't just share it to anyone
[53:41] you know
[53:45] in a simple way
[53:47] s
[53:57] that's how you cut your hair
[54:13] don't listen to him just keep walking
[54:15] with God
[54:18] look
[54:22] Enoch walks so much with God
[54:27] to the point that when he least realized
[54:29] he was already with God Brothers
[54:33] to the point that he didn't want to
[54:35] return again
[54:36] that is how it is
[54:39] keep walking with God
[54:46] lines can rise up against you
[55:21] to leave the place to my brother
[55:25] aura
[55:26] is absolutely
[55:30] is absolutely
[55:35] absolutely
[55:39] now if he is our absolute there can be
[55:40] no other app so you can have say well my
[55:43] church is my absolute my Creed is my
[55:44] absolutely
[55:51] if Christ is your absolute you believe
[55:53] Christ's word there's no other way to do
[55:55] it
[55:58] you know I think about the time that he
[56:00] saved me
[56:04] I'll tell you why I stand the way I do
[56:06] not to be different
[56:11] I made myself clear on that
[56:14] I hope I have
[56:23] why when Christ saved me there were
[56:25] millions of people groping in sin
[56:29] us
[56:30] when he saved me he had a purpose in
[56:32] doing it
[56:34] he had a purpose
[56:40] like me
[56:41] and somehow or another
[56:45] intelligentes when there was plenty of
[56:47] smart men Hombres Mas capacities more
[56:49] able to do it
[56:55] me here with not even a hardly a seventh
[56:58] grade education
[57:02] when there was men who studied in school
[57:04] and got degrees
[57:06] and doctors of divinity and philosophy
[57:09] and so forth
[57:12] safe
[57:21] I love you and you know that
[57:29] but I'm determining my heart that I'll
[57:31] never back on that one
[57:33] I'll stay right there this is
[57:41] foreign
[58:00] but to be honest and sincere with God
[58:03] look if somebody's going to bind you
[58:06] let it be to have things
[58:09] there is nothing that you can get out of
[58:21] he was a set apart from God
[58:25] I believe that God has something for you
[58:28] you are the future
[58:31] keep walking with God
[58:34] don't allow the world
[58:37] God bless you Brothers
[58:41] [Applause]
[58:55] it's beautiful how God works
[58:59] even when not knowing what my brother
[59:02] Isaac was going to preach about
[59:06] without knowing and yeah I can feel that
[59:10] God
[59:13] having control of all things
[59:17] the secrets of our hearts Los secretos
[59:21] you know the riddle saving like nigma
[59:24] the secret is
[59:27] and then all those two things
[59:30] what I bring tonight
[59:34] all fall in the lines
[59:38] of being placed in the heart the circles
[59:45] if you can take something from all three
[59:47] of us
[59:50] is God simply wants the most intimate
[59:54] part of you
[59:59] and the most intimate part of you
[1:00:02] can only be found inside your heart
[1:00:07] because in itself what can see it takes
[1:00:11] a lot of strengtha
[1:00:13] to to reveal yourself
[1:00:19] to give someone else
[1:00:22] the most intimate part of you
[1:00:27] you're allowing someone else
[1:00:30] to know things about you
[1:00:33] and no one else knows
[1:00:37] and you're you find yourself in your
[1:00:39] most vulnerable state
[1:00:44] and this is where Samsung found himself
[1:00:48] in that verse chapter 16 verse 18 and
[1:00:51] that's the verse
[1:00:55] where he opens his heart to Delilah
[1:01:00] and as many young people
[1:01:06] the young man
[1:01:08] Hombres many times a young lady comes
[1:01:11] into your life
[1:01:14] vice versa young ladies a young man
[1:01:16] comes into your life and
[1:01:22] you want to say you know what love is
[1:01:30] but when you come to know God's love
[1:01:35] the love that you feel in his body
[1:01:38] the love that you feel in his body
[1:01:41] does not compare
[1:01:43] it's a different type of love
[1:01:47] and the only way you can get to know
[1:01:50] about that love is
[1:01:54] when you can give your heart first to
[1:01:57] God
[1:02:00] and not do what Samson did in this case
[1:02:05] give his heart to someone else
[1:02:08] that he wanted to trust
[1:02:13] believing
[1:02:15] but the only person we can come to
[1:02:18] believe in and trust him
[1:02:24] again I've seen in my life
[1:02:28] brothers and sisters have seen it in
[1:02:30] their lives
[1:02:32] the only person you can be vulnerable
[1:02:35] with
[1:02:38] I know that they're not going to turn
[1:02:40] your back they're back on you is Dios
[1:02:45] because there is a huge difference
[1:02:47] between doing something foreign
[1:03:27] it's something that it's not for
[1:03:30] yourself it's for someone else
[1:03:32] brother Brandon says God's love
[1:03:37] God's love is the beginning of all love
[1:03:42] what makes you do things
[1:03:45] and when the church can get in the real
[1:03:48] love he says
[1:03:51] in the love of God in their hearts
[1:03:55] doing things
[1:03:59] ashamed
[1:04:01] how many have been a shades
[1:04:06] yeah it's happened to me it's come to me
[1:04:10] before
[1:04:11] but the reason is
[1:04:13] because there's a lack of love
[1:04:16] there's a lack of God inside
[1:04:20] of me
[1:04:21] but when that love of God can come
[1:04:24] inside
[1:04:26] it doesn't matter how sweet the voice is
[1:04:29] doesn't matter how much the devil
[1:04:31] presses
[1:04:58] in that line that comes against you
[1:05:22] gravity sometimes one more time it makes
[1:05:25] you like gravity
[1:05:27] that just makes people go towards you be
[1:05:30] pulled towards personas
[1:05:35] it's like brother Brandon says the world
[1:05:39] America
[1:05:41] was just wanting a little bit of love
[1:05:51] Godly type of blessings
[1:05:55] and like many of us
[1:05:58] to avoid many of the problems that we
[1:06:01] find ourselves
[1:06:04] if we could have foreign
[1:06:21] but yet God has a purpose to all things
[1:06:24] but
[1:06:27] the only way we know that purpose
[1:06:31] of that purpose
[1:06:34] is
[1:06:36] the most intimate places with God
[1:06:40] because the devil has always tried to
[1:06:43] take what belongs to God
[1:06:47] says in the message where thy strength
[1:06:50] where has thy strength gone Samson
[1:06:55] it says but in the Garden of Eden the
[1:06:58] devil chose the man's hair
[1:07:05] and now the Devil comes into the
[1:07:08] intellectual Diablo entrance and has
[1:07:12] brought his religion to intellectual
[1:07:16] he says you know you'll never know God
[1:07:18] intellectually you say this
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:08:03] nothing can be taken away from him
[1:08:07] he's always wanted to take God's Throne
[1:08:14] were designed
[1:08:17] and what is designed for God's dwelling
[1:08:20] place
[1:08:23] as much as the devil who tries to fit in
[1:08:25] there
[1:08:28] [Music]
[1:08:40] you're not 100 sure
[1:08:47] you can find your your heart
[1:08:50] but when you can find yourself
[1:08:53] placed in God's hands
[1:09:00] foreign
[1:09:36] compared to God's love comparable so I
[1:09:39] love about this world offers
[1:09:45] again like my brothers if you could take
[1:09:47] anything
[1:09:51] I'm trying to
[1:09:52] just trying to make sure
[1:09:56] I'm not trying to waste no more time
[1:10:01] but ask yourself tonight
[1:10:05] am I putting my heart in the right place
[1:10:10] where I'm going
[1:10:12] is my heart in it
[1:10:16] what I'm doing for God
[1:10:19] is my heart in it
[1:10:22] many times you find ourselves like
[1:10:24] Samsung
[1:10:27] we give our our body instead of our
[1:10:30] hearts
[1:10:35] where it's supposed to be the opposite
[1:10:39] God has always wanted to deal with a
[1:10:41] person's Hearts
[1:10:45] Jesus
[1:10:47] what is the greatest of The Commandments
[1:10:51] he said You shall love your God with all
[1:10:54] your heart
[1:10:56] foreign
[1:11:56] Eva
[1:13:49] but many but again God knows all things
[1:13:54] God knows why you go through things
[1:13:59] he wants to show you something
[1:14:02] like a brother Eric said
[1:14:05] there was a reason
[1:14:13] there's a lot of better people than us
[1:14:15] I'm muchas personas
[1:14:18] are a lot more devoted people than us
[1:14:23] worthy of God's Grace
[1:14:54] trying to be like the world
[1:15:31] cry cry out wholeheartedly
[1:15:35] that's when many times we lack as long
[1:15:38] as
[1:15:40] says it's a lack of sincerity
[1:15:44] and there's a sturdist sincerity that
[1:15:47] God requires
[1:15:50] I don't know what's going on tonight
[1:15:55] I don't know how God wants to move right
[1:15:57] now
[1:16:00] but if tonight
[1:16:03] you could do what you're not used to
[1:16:05] doing
[1:16:09] and be vulnerable
[1:16:14] be vulnerable with God right now
[1:16:19] I'm telling you again
[1:16:22] he's never going to turn your back on
[1:16:25] you
[1:16:26] he's never going to make fun of you
[1:16:29] how you phrase them
[1:16:32] how you sing to him
[1:16:36] he loves it when you do that
[1:16:39] he loves to see you when when you're
[1:16:42] being the real
[1:17:00] but only in the love of God and that
[1:17:05] secret place
[1:17:08] can God be with you
[1:17:12] if you could please stand
[1:17:17] foreign
[1:17:56] foreign
[1:18:07] dying in her mother's arms
[1:18:13] seeing her suffer Miranda and him crying
[1:18:16] with all his heart
[1:18:18] God please don't take my little girl
[1:18:22] please don't take my little girl
[1:18:25] the things he loved the most
[1:18:31] the thing that took his heart
[1:18:36] but then later on a brother comes to
[1:18:38] brother Branham
[1:18:40] and he asks them the questions
[1:18:44] after God took your little girl and your
[1:18:47] wife away
[1:18:51] how do you feel towards God
[1:18:55] do you still love him
[1:18:59] after he took everything from you
[1:19:03] and then our Prophet turns and says
[1:19:06] I love him with all my life
[1:19:10] I love him with all my heart
[1:19:18] I could be alone physically
[1:19:22] I can be an audible
[1:19:28] thank you Father
[1:19:30] but because I gave my heart to God
[1:19:35] because I let them enter into not only
[1:19:38] my living room
[1:19:40] not only it's in the kitchen
[1:19:43] to the bedroom of my heart
[1:19:53] oh
[1:19:55] that love I have towards him
[1:19:59] makes me do and say things
[1:20:03] that it's out of My Own Strength
[1:20:07] I know it's no longer
[1:20:11] I know it's no longer me doing it
[1:20:15] by the power of his love me
[1:20:21] that helps me do it
[1:20:24] [Music]
[1:20:27] the prophet says before praying
[1:20:30] with your heads bowed
[1:20:34] concertos I would like to ask you this
[1:20:36] question as your brother
[1:20:40] and who loves you

[1:20:46] not to come and and Pat you know
[1:20:51] but to make sure that you're right with
