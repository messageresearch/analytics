foreign [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Music] because this is where you find life [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] there is [Music] there is [Music] tower there is [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] [Music] there is power [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we welcome him back where he comes from brother felix as well [Music] [Music] elsa [Music] [Music] me [Music] oh oh [Music] [Music] me [Music] m [Music] [Music] elbe [Music] oh [Music] oh foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] good to see you once again if you'd open your bibles to the book of revelation chapter two oh boy everyone is doing well receive greetings from the brothers from bakersfield javier jose delgadillo ingredients to all the congregation because that thou suffer christ which called herself a prophet to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication to eating sacrifice unto idols [Music] the name of our lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated amen amen glory to god we're speaking on the diet here at church agenda a little bit in attention on the temptation it says here it's not what's in the outward standing have a few things against quesadillas that woman jezebel which calls herself a prophet is to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eating sacrifice into idols dominion about the emotions and the feelings they control us [Music] and that's why i want to focus on that word of seduce because it goes with everything that we've been talking about there's nothing or nobody like a woman that's what the prophet says and then it says there's nothing or nobody that can be used to deceive like the woman now the reason that i believe that the devil likes to use the woman [Music] [Music] his emotions or his feelings and he's not so much led by the emotions or feelings now i'm not saying that is better [Music] h and he speaks on on jezebel and then he quotes santiago james 1 14. it says but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed now brother speaking on jezebel then he keeps reading in the book of uh james um [Music] but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust has conceived it bringeth for sin and when and sin when it is finished brings forth death then brother brandon begins to speak he says this is now in in the verse it's not on here but hey no say it again okay uh i mean now that is a picture of exactly what is happening [Music] now that is a picture of exactly what is happening in the church ages sensation a sin started in nothing but a feeling now repeat after me i'm saying this is a sim and so started with a sensation the sensation is the same as an emotion comment so the death of the church started with the simple little notice deeds of the nicolaitans from the one to a doctor from the doctrine it embraced the power of the state and the introduction of paganism now watch what brother says it's an emotional sensation [Music] [Music] he's a prophet of god so that he would come and tell you the truth he always comes and tells me something i don't want to hear when well and he said i saw israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have no not a shepherd and the lord said estos these have no masses let them return every man to his house in peace fall at ramos gilead and once said on this manner and the other said on that manner now when brother is speaking on the scripture in the book of kings the one we just read i hope you've read the prophet micah saw that there was a conference in heaven and there came forth the spirit brother brahm says that it came from hell is i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shalt persuade him and prevail also go forth and do so ladies what was happening with these spirits temptation trying to make us fall behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets but every man is tempted when he is drawn away out of his own lust and entices um you have to not desire anything because suffering there's a great suffering all right so i told people the classes as a sales there's all kinds of desires so my question is what are you desiring what are you desiring open in the ears when we hear something that we want our mind is very open when the enemy comes and tells us something that we want to hear [Music] he had everything the attributes he had in him there wasn't something outside of him that he desired there was something in him that was already in him nosotros we [Music] if they're unhappy they'll be unhappy or married or single a man or a woman will not make you happy deceives us exterior has everything he needed within us yes sir his word is already in a son or daughter of god but the devil um leads us to believe us that we need certain things isn't that right brothers or that is a dilemma that's the problem that's why we suffer pores that's why the devil tempts us let me tell you the blessings of god no son exteriors are not external las vegas [Music] yes but hallelujah [Music] so many times we get very fanatical no no sir we stress out we worry we worry we we worry so much por las cosas for the things exteriors external things you realize that's where a seduction enters because there are things that you want i deserve there are desires you have that are not of god your desires i need to make sure that you understand what i'm telling you the devil tempts me because i'm desiring external things church or wherever i'll get me that it will make you better and the people are desired human beings it's it's for them to they want to be somebody is deposited within us [Music] it's a perverted desire you can see all that god has placed in you you could see the beauty that a daughter of god has within the equalities to be the did you know that the most holy it's not the external things what makes a woman beautiful it's the what's within this it's not the building says brother branham no es el corro it's not the choir no type of preaching of the renowned name that make the people of the church great it's the character says brothers it's the character de la iglesia within the church oh the odds oh beautiful that makes them beautiful oh hallelujah hallelujah [Music] what good does it do woman you brothers we give so much effort and we don't put an effort towards the things that they don't see that's right [Music] he said him on the brandon brother branham says when the when the bride realizes can i say who she is [Music] [Music] my daughter [Laughter] other things [Music] comes from what we're desiring the feelings are like these prophets the bigger the group must see less the easier it is that's why the devil uses the organization that's when everybody's believing the same thing you know he hates [Music] instead of the holy spirit he speaks a lot on controlling our tongues many we don't have control of it but if you are hanging around with people that gossip that speak about the word of god sooner or later you're going to like it effective that's why the organization is so effective because when they're all saying that the the heavens are red you begin to ask yourself why do i see it blue malcolm is there maybe there's something wrong with me is is it right is this it ready is it red there's something wrong with me is they were all saying the same thing that spirit just disperses very easily our feelings they don't value you here you are tolerating temptations will come to all of us even jesus was tempted the problem is that we give him we give him the other place we we hold him there rectangle i retain the bad thoughts of that's where the problem is tolerance we are tolerated i believe in attacking bad thoughts how are we going to attack them with the word of god what god says [Music] and [Music] must grant me there's a greater desire [Music] there's a greater desire [Music] in the depths of my heart that tells me i have something better for you better than anything the devil is offering you i have something better for you [Music] [Music] listen to what i have for you [Music] there's a desire for god [Music] [Music] [Music] the beauty of god [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] so [Music] foreign is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] no [Music] is [Music] hey [Music] is [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Music] [Music]
