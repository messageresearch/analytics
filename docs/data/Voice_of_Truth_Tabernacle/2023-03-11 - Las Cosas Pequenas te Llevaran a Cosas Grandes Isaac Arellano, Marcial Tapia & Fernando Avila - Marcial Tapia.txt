[Music] hello [Music] [Laughter] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] be saved baby [Music] [Music] amen [Applause] yes [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] birthday ideas [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] we're happy to be here to share God's word amen opportunities for the opportunity he's given us this evening brings those that watches throughout the internet and then tell them God bless you see you this evening when you're finished if you go with me to First Samuel 16 13. speaking of the characters of The Bible and our character continues being David the title this evening is the small things will take you to the greater things [Music] first Samuel 16 13. when you have it you could say Amen Manny um let's wait for our brothers are looking for the scripture hey man this has seen it says like this is Anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to Rama and first Samuel 18. two chapters after and the woman answered one another as they played and said Saul had slain his thousands and David his ten thousands one more scripture first Samuel 18 verse 11. hey this is like this and Saul cast a javelin for he said I will Smite David even to the wall with it and David avoided out of his presence twice in the prayer Celestial is the father we're grateful this evening because we are undeserving to be here you make us perfect before your eyes you I said this word would be of help to my brothers she would move in the ears in the mind of my brothers would give us a revelation of your word this evening and help those that are on their way Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may be Cedar brothers and there's more room about David in the Bible than any other characters besides Jesus there's more about Jesus as number one and number two it's about more about David is David David has 66 chapters his name is mentioned over 600 times in the Bible is and an interesting fact uh never an interesting fact is David is the only man because who is called a man after God's Own Hearts the only man who has called that in the Bible and this can bring confliction to us because David committed adultery and he wasn't perfect he slept with someone else's wife you know he said he wasn't perfect and that's good to know for us tonight nobody here is perfect if someone's perfect you came to the wrong place there's only Imperfects here for now with a healthy heart you can have a healthy leadership and with a toxic heart that he saw allowed his heart to gradually turn against God wasn't all of a sudden but it was gradually slowly and now uh leadership is stewardship is leadership is stewardship is leadership if you can get something tonight leadership and stewardship is if you don't Steward your leadership right so you still knows God can pull you out of there at any time because God puts Kings and takes Kings off and when a leader doesn't let himself be led by God he will self-destruct his own leadership self-destruct his own leadership and the difference between Saul and David's heart was this if you're taking notes Saul had a fear of man and David had fear of God Saul was worried and David worshiped [Music] and David wanted God's presence [Music] now David was being faithful in the in the fields shepherding before he was anointed by Samuel Anthony and now think about yourself where are we being faithful to God are you working for God where does God have you working some theologians I was looking this up say that when Samuel anointed David uh that that Samuel came to to David and he whispered to him you're going to be Israel's Future King Israel what does a person do with that what would you do with that okay so uh quickly here I remember one time I was in prayer here and our pastor anointed me with oil and I thought I was um over my head um I thought I was very special you know I let it get to me but that led me to my ruin as some of you know I was thinking that all these plans were for me I wanted to take authority before time and what do you do when you find out what's in your future but it's not gonna happen yet what David did he went back to serve his father to serve his brother and even sir he was faithful in the future does that make sense if you have questions ask me later now saw here was developing a pride issue and he's beginning to resent David here and he begins resenting him because the people were saying his thousands David has ten thousands and what what happens and bitterness or Envy Saul tries to kill his uh kill David whom now was his enemy enemy for jealousy foreign comes in where he tries to throw a spear at David now what if someone threw a spear at you what if someone did something bad to you or somebody spoke about your family or somebody spoke about your pastor amen I know somebody about your brother what about if they spoke about your children or your wife what's the common thing to do and but instead of that ESO when the spear was thrown at David still honors his his King David that God asked him to serve he doesn't throw the spirit back instead and said he runs to Jonathan Saul's son and tells Jonathan about his father's jealousy but now watch if David threw that Spear and Jonathan didn't know what happened he would have had two enemies this would have been a succession of bad Deeds [Music] but instead he got an ally with this king is mad he tried to kill me and the Lord has anointed me so I'm gonna be king anyways but he didn't do that until God saw fits to give him the kingdom amen now how many of us have taken Authority before it's given to us and that's what David didn't do yes David didn't take authority before God gave it to him and even more admirable was when uh David had opportunities to kill saws David refused because blessed are the peacemakers and David would even saying touch my hand against saw okay but even he even said against the Lord's anointed he was respecting the authority and how our pastor has been saying to receive Authority it must be under Authority and David on the other hand he's humble [Music] and submits to authorities he stays faithful to everything that God called him and now in closing I'd like to share this uh saying I forgot who says this but they say they say don't let your success get to your head or your failure go to your heart Corazon can I repeat that don't let your success get to your hearts forgive me don't let your success get to your head right or your failure gets your hearts David got anointed it could have gone to his head he said I'm living this ship I'm anointed I'm green light to be king yes but he stood under Authority amen amen Authority cannot be taken it must be given so many times we miss out on God we miss out on God's blessings or we don't get everything God wants to bless us with and something to meditate about I'd like to close with this uh quote from our brother brand name and it says in the message why little Bethlehem is says another great event that I wouldn't forget to call that was when David was in his worst of time when he was a fugitive he'd already been anointed he was to be king God said so and yet he was hated he was standing between two great deep fires here was the Philistines on one side after him okay here was Saul on the other side and he was a man without a nation a man without a nation how rejected just as the church stands today the true Living Church of God without a denomination or anything else she stands alone she stands alone they should make us excited brother but yeah she's had the anointing port on her it says she knows where she is but let's all say this together I know what I am the bride knows what she is and just one more quote unasitamas I it's only one sentence it's only one sentence it says what a beautiful picture that is of Christ today okay a fugitive Christ of fugitive today and Christ is rejected the Holy Ghost is rejected like a fugitive trying to hide somewhere knocking here and there knocking at the hearts like a fugitive it says that was Christ on the outside of the church knocking trying to get back in his own church God bless you Brothers [Applause] the Lord bless you Brothers ten you can put it on the screen is and if you can also put up the time for me okay this is esta Manera I read like this [Music] is faithful in that which is least is faithful also and much isn't just awesome who will commit to you trust the true riches and if you have not been faithful in that which is another man who shall give you that which is your own no serving can serve to Masters for he will either hate you love the other yes or else he will hold to the Oneness you cannot serve God and Mammon curios may God help us Brothers I shared it with my brothers and he told me those little things we'll take you to big things little things to great things a small factor is going to take you to the greater things that's why I believe that God chose it is foreign tonight tonight I don't know how many Davis there are tonight I don't know how many songs because there can also be sauce men that feel like they're too great by the people Brothers was chosen by God he was elected by God he was a young man he was a small now [Music] all right everything starts with the small things everything starts with the Small Things amen brothers and the little things they're gonna take you to great things amen Brothers now hey I'm going to read this message priest in 1963. but so many people like to say I belong but that's not the question that's not the policy that I'm talking about this morning and I tell you tonight it's eternal life everlasting life never begins is to receive eternal life [Music] and you become a part of God what's going on with you I hope to get to this point but look David David he could see God in Simplicity because he was obedient he was a man after God's Own Heart it was the election of God Hermanos usted and look Brothers you are an election of God you didn't choose God I want you to know that you are the election of God because God chose and that's why we struggle is because we didn't choose God so God chose us God chose David and because God chose him that God had elections when he was caring for a sheep [Music] foreign amen Brothers now the story doesn't end a bear also came to try and take one of his sheep and what happened brothers who killed that bear as well it didn't stop there either they continue to advance because of all the brothers that I preach the story to us that when uh Samuel went to go annoying foreign oh see see yes I have a son his name is David go call him a little guy he comes up meaning look youth no they can don't live don't let anyone to push don't put don't let anyone put values you look at the value God has given you and you're worth more than ten thousand words and that's something great you're serving a gray God or Hermanos oh Brothers miracles of god amen Brothers come on youth open up your heart so that you can see God that is the story didn't stop there either continued on take some food to his brothers that were at War yeah and that's where what we think was the greatest part of his life but the greatest part in fact was when he started doing because the witnessed why we can't stand us that makes everything possible I'm a witness of that and that's why that's why I love this a warrior someone who suffers someone who battles someone who's not playing Church all of his heart and that's why I give them I give myself because I love you and I want God to use and see why God sent you here and God sent you here and now I'm going to read in a little bit for you to be Warriors Hallelujah Matthew 16 18. and I say unto you that our Peters I will build my church Gloria shall not Prevail against it where's brother Alex they won't Prevail against it okay it is shall be bound in heaven shall lose shall be loosed in heaven Brothers is the key of all of our problems God is the key to all that we need it's necessary for us come on children of God if you use it tonight look at this youth emperor in first Samuel 16 40. we say it says and he took his staff in his hands and chosen five stones out of the brook s bag yeah and he drew near to the Philistines look Brothers what did he take she took five Stones says that those five Stones they represented our Lord Jesus Christ it has five letters the name of Jesus he went with us it gives me great pleasure to see a youth that is filled with the holy spirit that knows where he's still where he stands and that is what God has sent us to do is for us to be filled with the Holy Spirit now do you believe that that's possible I believe that with all of my heart that God wants us holy spirit is going to send us over there to return it remember this look those five stones those five small stones brother random says that one stone we are one of those stones a small Stone [Music] it says [Music] those rocks tomorrow you stand ing because the life of God if you apply it in yourself [Music] God needs you need we go to the pastor because he's a little Rock A Little Rock covered in Honey that's covered in Honey and that's why when we live foreign that's covered in honey amen glorious glory to God can you listen to you may God bless you and may God use you [Applause] amen what a tremendous word amen is please stand with me quickly reading two scriptures first Samuel 17. verse 34-37 Zechariah 4 verse 10. Uno so David said into Saul the servant keeps kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock foreign and I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him the service flew both The Lion and the bear and this is uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he had defied the armies of the Living God is David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the lion and out of the power of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee is the pregunta it is for who has despised the day of small things you may be seated Brothers we all know the story of Davido when he faced the the Goliath right I'm not going to repeat it before that fight what was David doing who was David was dedicated they were in the army they were soldiers um and this was the story oh [Music] identification he knew the nature of the enemies that's just one let them take it but he began to think I believe and said buenos and I don't give him a fight he's going to come tomorrow and keep those sheep foreign of a story that our co-workers shared with me this is he said that there was this young man that went to the pastor and said I want to get baptized Pastor said okay that's fine um uh classes no classes they they did some studies in order for him to learn what the baptism was they said he got out of the drugs yeah days prior to him being baptized they said he went to the Past he said pastor he said pastor he said another uh some more marijuana said no you shoot it he continued insisting let me have just a little bit more no you can't you shouldn't and he continued to continue until the pastor told him that's fine smoke that joint but do it where God doesn't see him whether it be good or bad Oh Glory God saw that David was faithful to his work he tells David you know before I use you more before I do great things put you in a small test or trouble I have great things for you I want to see how faithful you are going to be with me what the clocks other s is that we we are undervalued the the the the the small things one of the preaches he was preaching to his church and we could say his church was in a season yes it was it was not in a very good condition maybe in a cold but he said that he said there was no Revival there was the small things they weren't doing okay never go back from having a Revival nominations but we can't foreign under John Wesley that when John Wesley was on Earth he was one of the greatest against the Catholic Church the Anglican church and he said you should live a holy life I should live a life of Holiness [Music] he said they wouldn't be able to hold that amen [Music] we come to church that's what we put amen so much is required there are steps the psalmist David said the steps of a righteous I want to thank God because I'm a Son of God Amen amen foreign [Music] [Music] amen please my time is running out sometimes I feel like the smallest the young lady said yes I could everything you do nothing's in vain [Music] young man [Music] God doesn't need to be something great [Music] and the message I'm finishing with this says he never made any reputations [Music] he didn't make a name for himself

that David did more than any other thing is that he was a worshiper is where the Isaac said there was 60-something books about David [Music] there's more than 100 songs that from David contributing to David so David was something it was a worshiper I believe we can all identify with that part of David that in the battles he worshiped God and the problems we worship God the defeats he worshiped God it was never too important it was never too important it was never too great to come in New York before God and worship him [Music] once again that's how I just put those avids so they they be to God
