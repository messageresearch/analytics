[31:41] true
[31:44] the war is

[34:33] foreign
[35:39] amen Brothers
[35:42] that's why there's many problems
[35:47] but we have to understand why
[35:49] the devil came to what they came to
[35:53] destroy he didn't come to restore God
[35:56] came to restore
[35:58] but the devil came to destroy amen
[36:01] Brothers
[36:07] to understand
[36:13] God on Earth

[36:22] that we need to listen
[36:25] to the word of God
[36:28] not only here is but understand it
[36:35] and understand
[36:39] is to understand it's very important
[36:43] because if we don't understand

[40:59] is
[41:00] the sad thing is that here at church

[41:07] it's been preached to us
[41:17] God is family
[41:20] yes Brothers

[41:45] how beautiful that is
[41:47] to be able to find that that's why I'm
[41:51] here
[41:54] we have a pastor yeah Brothers
[42:33] Hermanos Brothers
[42:41] that we would close our eyes
[42:44] be able to meditate and stay

[47:01] Espero
[47:35] foreign
[47:48] [Music]
[48:24] hear that
[48:26] but
[48:27] we all we all look look good
[48:31] but my main point is
[48:34] so we don't have to uh appear
[48:38] or pretend that we're something we're
[48:40] not
[48:41] my main point is
[48:43] that there is the message
[48:50] has been given to us in these last days
[48:54] you need to pretend something this is
[49:01] an answer yes
[50:03] that we're not to be something we're not
[50:15] a persona is
[50:20] you pretend you have something that you
[50:23] don't have
[50:26] so you pretend to possess only but in
[50:28] reality you do not have it foreign
[51:14] you can't lie to your family
[51:28] I saw
[51:32] it was posted your wife Brothers
[51:39] when your wife doesn't get close to you
[51:42] to ask for your help something is wrong
[51:45] in you know
[51:49] to ask for yourself your children
[51:52] something is wrong with me
[52:33] things that are necessary to survive
[52:35] foreign
[53:44] for God
[53:55] what account will we give
[53:58] um
[54:04] could you imagine Brothers
[54:07] 20 30 years
[54:24] in the Christian home foreign
[55:26] foreign
[56:05] about the real things of life
[56:16] this in the bride
[56:19] they say yes
[56:22] and I proceed
[56:28] they say
[56:32] this is
[56:38] let's see okay
[56:40] is
[56:48] always taught your family according to
[56:50] work the word and tell them what is
[56:51] written what the Bible says and what the
[56:53] message
[56:55] what the message told us and
[56:58] um
[57:02] there's a great key there
[57:05] if you want a good marriage
[57:08] correct what you have messed up correct
[57:13] because if you don't make it right
[57:15] you'll continue walking
[57:17] continue
[57:26] to have a happy marriage in your life
[57:33] because you haven't corrected that
[57:36] Dennis you must you must yeah
[57:40] you must fix that yeah
[57:45] you do better you better fix the problem
[57:49] there is no way you have a happy family
[58:02] I'm telling you because I know
[58:09] how to fix things in my life foreign
[58:34] these are the Four Keys Brothers
[58:37] the first thing you need
[58:40] yes
[58:44] or however it may be is
[58:47] communication is
[58:51] that's the worldwide
[58:54] problems
[59:19] or chaos in any company
[59:25] or anything that is done you see
[59:27] Misfortune or chaos old cows or chaos
[59:33] what is the world's falling apart
[59:35] for the same reason
[59:38] where there's foreign
[1:00:26] the first problem there is in marriages
[1:00:29] eh porque we don't talk to one another
[1:00:33] you just talk to me what's wrong with
[1:00:36] her
[1:00:37] I don't talk with her either
[1:00:41] and then all of a sudden where we were
[1:00:43] looking at each other in a bad way
[1:00:46] back
[1:00:48] [Music]
[1:00:51] and then
[1:01:23] because there's something wrong
[1:02:23] I got three
[1:02:49] and he kicked her
[1:02:52] oh just let me have him for a little bit
[1:02:57] they're model Brothers
[1:03:01] what's going to be of that child
[1:03:04] that's why the world is the way it is
[1:03:07] because there's no communication
[1:03:16] your marriage will fail
[1:03:20] you're going to say why it has failed
[1:03:24] why did it happen like this
[1:03:27] why are things happening in the church
[1:03:30] why are the brothers
[1:03:35] one another
[1:03:37] in order to fix it
[1:03:39] let's fix the thing let's make it right
[1:03:43] it builds up and then there's the next
[1:03:45] great explosion okay
[1:03:53] to learn the art of communication it's
[1:03:56] an art icles
[1:04:05] they might just throw the tortilla in
[1:04:08] your face

[1:04:41] let's communicate with our significant
[1:04:43] other
