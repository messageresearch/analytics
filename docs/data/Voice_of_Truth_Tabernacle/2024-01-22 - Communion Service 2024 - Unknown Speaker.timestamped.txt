[31:08] open your
[31:10] Bibles
[31:19] those
[31:25] amen it's it's to be able to to have
[31:28] communion with
[31:31] you I believe you are my
[31:35] family you are my
[31:39] family I believe when Jesus Took the
[31:43] communion he did it with his
[31:47] family he did it with those
[31:49] disciples who loved
[31:53] him and they loved him and he loved them
[31:59] want to let you know that I love
[32:04] you it's good to be here in this place
[32:06] with
[32:07] you book
[32:13] ofosa we're gonna take the story
[32:17] OFA a very wellknown
[32:21] story God put it on my heart for this
[32:26] evening
[32:27] and
[32:30] go we knowa was a prophet of
[32:35] God and we know Goomer was a prostitute
[32:38] a
[32:45] harlot and and God gives an order
[32:49] to a very odd
[32:54] order we're going to try to focus here
[32:56] brother
[32:59] are
[33:00] well try to
[33:04] focus chapter
[33:07] one verse
[33:09] one if you find it did you find
[33:25] it the word of the Lord that came unto
[33:28] Hosea the son ofi in the days of Uzziah
[33:32] jotham ahaz and Hezekiah Kings of Judah
[33:35] and in the days of
[33:37] jeroboam the son of johash the king of
[33:55] Israel the beginning of the word of Lord
[33:57] by Hosea and the Lord said to Hosea go
[33:59] take unto thee a wife of whoredom and
[34:01] children of whoredoms for the land had
[34:03] committed great whoredom departing from
[34:05] the
[34:14] Lord so he went and took G the daughter
[34:16] of duim which conceived and bear him a
[34:19] son
[34:20] amen I want to read one more
[34:23] scripture First Corinthians 11
[34:28] First Corinthians
[34:31] 11 verse
[34:33] 23 it's a very sacred
[34:36] time special
[34:40] time it was so special for the Lord
[34:42] Jesus
[34:44] Christ and it should be special for us
[34:46] as
[34:48] well we should take it with much
[34:52] seriousness which and much
[34:55] sincerity brother speaks on the message
[34:59] communion he says when we come to
[35:02] communion we should do
[35:14] itely vers 1 Corinthians 11:23 for I
[35:17] have received of the Lord that which
[35:18] also I delivered unto you that the Lord
[35:20] Jesus the same night in which he was
[35:21] betrayed took
[35:25] bread
[35:33] and when he had given thanks he break it
[35:35] and said take eat this is my body which
[35:37] is broken for you this do in remembrance
[35:39] of
[35:52] me after the same manner also he took
[35:54] the cup when he had SED saying this is
[35:57] the New Testament in my blood this do ye
[35:59] as often as ye drink it in remembrance
[36:02] of
[36:11] me for as often as he eat this bread and
[36:13] drink this cup ye do show the Lord's
[36:16] death till he
[36:23] come wherefore whosoever shall eat of
[36:26] this bread and drink this cup of the
[36:28] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[36:30] body and the blood of the Lord Jesus let
[36:33] us pray Heavenly
[36:36] Father we come before
[36:40] you not as people that are
[36:44] perfect but people that need of your
[36:48] blood people that need to be
[36:51] remembered of Your Love toward
[36:54] us Lord we put ourselves in your hands
[36:58] as the word
[37:00] flows and as we take this communion with
[37:04] you that there would be Souls being
[37:08] restored Souls that are repented
[37:12] sincere there will be sick being
[37:14] healed people being
[37:17] delivered even people receiving the Holy
[37:21] Ghost we know that you do we believe you
[37:24] will do
[37:25] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[37:28] amen you may be seated just a few
[37:32] moments we want to
[37:34] speak with the
[37:37] thought return to him and
[37:40] stay return to him and
[37:43] stay now when the Lord Jesus
[37:47] Christ instituted uh the
[37:52] communion when he said that this would
[37:54] be one of his
[37:55] ordinances
[37:58] he said that when we did
[38:00] it we would remember of
[38:04] him that we would do it in his
[38:08] memory it's as if God
[38:12] knew that we would need times to
[38:16] remember God
[38:19] knew that we are very e very easily
[38:23] forget how many acknowledge that
[38:28] we remember very easily or
[38:31] for we forget what he has done for
[38:36] us our mind begins to slip very
[38:42] easily back into the things of the
[38:46] world or the things that are not good
[38:48] for us and God
[38:52] says I will provide a
[38:55] way to REM
[38:58] you to remind you how much I love
[39:02] you to remind you where your true home
[39:07] is I believe that's what the communion
[39:09] is
[39:11] about it's about
[39:14] remembering who our first love
[39:18] is who is the OWN of our
[39:22] hearts who's the one that deserves our
[39:25] worship who is it brother it's our
[39:28] God it's the one that died for
[39:31] us the one that gave it all for you
[39:35] and he is the one that deserves
[39:39] it and I'll go back to the story of
[39:42] Hosea a little bit and of
[39:44] [Music]
[39:46] goer the name
[39:49] goer it means completion or end I
[39:54] believe that we need to get to the point
[40:01] we're completely certain of who the Lord
[40:02] Jesus Christ is for
[40:05] us think on
[40:09] that because many times we're not 100%
[40:14] sure and that's why he has to remind us
[40:17] once
[40:19] againa being a prophet of God we know
[40:22] the
[40:23] story God
[40:25] tells take a
[40:28] woman I imagine he saw a
[40:34] vision of of him getting married with a
[40:37] woman named
[40:38] Goomer when he saw that
[40:41] Vision he was probably
[40:44] surprised how a man of God like
[40:47] him that had
[40:50] desired to marry a pure
[40:53] woman had
[40:55] desired to raise his
[41:00] children in a let's put it this way a
[41:03] Christian
[41:04] Home in a a home that was
[41:09] God-fearing imagine he saw his
[41:12] life knowing a woman
[41:16] clean a woman that loved the
[41:19] Lord a woman that kept herself for
[41:22] God a prophet an example for the people
[41:26] in that in that
[41:28] town imagine he
[41:31] thought when I get married I'm gonna
[41:34] marry someone that loves the Lord like
[41:39] me that we could both serve the Lord
[41:42] together and raise our
[41:45] children be an example to this
[41:50] nation yet when God shows him the
[41:55] vision
[41:57] I imagine that when his heart began to
[41:59] break when he saw that
[42:01] Vision his dreams be were shattered he
[42:05] was like what is
[42:07] this how is it I will marry this
[42:11] Goomer she is a
[42:15] harlot but God has a
[42:18] way to convince
[42:21] us God has a way to make us
[42:24] see that it is all plan of
[42:28] God it all happens with a
[42:30] purpose and most
[42:34] certainly after he had wrestled with god
[42:37] with his
[42:39] thoughts to feel something for this
[42:43] woman he said maybe my love will
[42:45] convince
[42:48] her maybe the way I treat her will
[42:50] convince
[42:53] her maybe if I show her an unconditional
[42:55] love
[42:58] she won't be the woman that she
[43:01] is Imagine You began to feel something
[43:03] for
[43:05] her when he went to her
[43:09] father when he went to
[43:11] deim to ask for her
[43:14] hands the
[43:17] father he probably
[43:20] left he said how are you is it that
[43:22] you're going to want my
[43:23] daughter how are you going to want her
[43:28] imagine he thought it was some kind of
[43:31] mockery and he insisted so
[43:38] much says if you want it like that then
[43:41] so be it
[43:42] take let me tell
[43:45] you when God looked at
[43:49] us he accepted a
[43:52] problem he accepted the challenge
[43:57] he accepted a person that was broken
[44:00] full of
[44:03] flaws where the heart wasn't in the
[44:05] right
[44:07] place accepted a problem like me he
[44:10] accepted a problem like
[44:12] you let me tell you we've been a problem
[44:15] for
[44:16] God I
[44:20] imagine when
[44:25] Hosea
[44:27] began to draw near unto
[44:33] Goomer imagine he would just be looking
[44:36] at
[44:37] her and she would
[44:42] say why is this man looking at me like
[44:45] that when a man looks at
[44:48] me he just thinks about my
[44:51] body he just thinks about the pleasure
[44:57] but he's not thinking about that I can
[44:59] see
[45:00] it his eyes
[45:02] see beyond my
[45:05] body beyond my
[45:07] spirits beyond my
[45:12] errors something
[45:15] different he's not looking at me with
[45:17] eyes of
[45:18] lust there something different
[45:22] here how beautiful it is to
[45:24] know that there's
[45:27] somebody that sees you
[45:32] different oh Church there is
[45:35] somebody that looks at us
[45:38] different there's somebody that looks
[45:42] beyond what we can do for
[45:46] them but he sees that what he can do for
[45:49] us isn't it good for you to
[45:53] know that there's somebody who sees you
[45:54] with so much love
[45:58] he doesn't look at you seeing
[46:00] your or thinking of your
[46:05] flaws what that may have done for
[46:08] Goomer imagine she
[46:12] said there's something wrong with
[46:14] you when he
[46:17] said goer I want to marry
[46:21] you she said oh there's something wrong
[46:23] with you you're not thinking right
[46:29] you're not thinking things
[46:31] through don't you realize who I
[46:37] am I imagine the only reason she wanted
[46:40] to marry him or she married
[46:43] with is because he was so insistent or
[46:46] persistent he insisted so
[46:50] much imagine she said well fine
[46:53] then I imagine Brothers
[46:58] we've come to the feet of
[47:02] Jesus not with a complete
[47:09] heart we've come because oh they insist
[47:12] so
[47:14] much they preach and they preach and
[47:16] they
[47:18] preach it's fine to accept the Lord
[47:24] Jesus sometimes we do it but we don't do
[47:27] it with a complete
[47:32] heart
[47:34] do because well he's the only one that
[47:36] asked me to marry
[47:43] him imagine if she didn't do that
[47:45] because he insisted so much but I
[47:48] believe in her
[47:50] heart she perhaps
[47:54] felt that that wasn't an error how many
[47:57] of us at one time or another have
[48:01] said why am I in
[48:05] church why did God choose
[48:08] me he must he probably made a
[48:11] mistake I believe there's more than one
[48:13] of us
[48:16] here that are like the
[48:21] Publican that was beside that
[48:24] Pharisee
[48:26] and that Publican must have
[48:29] felt Lord forgive me because I'm not
[48:32] like
[48:35] him but forgive me because I'm not like
[48:37] the ones that serve you
[48:38] here have you ever felt that
[48:42] way you ever said oh Lord forgive
[48:45] me I don't know why you have me
[48:48] here not like these holy
[48:52] people I'm not like these people that
[48:54] deserve your love
[48:56] they deserve your
[48:58] love but I don't deserve it
[49:06] Lord imagine
[49:08] that first
[49:11] days things may have been a little tense
[49:14] at
[49:17] home but yeah he did all he
[49:20] could to make her feel
[49:24] comfortable
[49:27] so that she would relax a little
[49:30] bit how much has God not
[49:34] done so that we would be
[49:38] comfortable how much has he
[49:42] done because when we accept him many
[49:45] times we're still not certain many
[49:50] times we really haven't given our hearts
[49:53] completely to
[49:54] him
[49:57] it's like as we say yes but in our heart
[49:59] we
[50:02] know still thinking and pondering on
[50:04] other
[50:05] things we still want other
[50:08] things we still desire other things yes
[50:12] or yes
[50:16] Brothers our heart is not completely
[50:22] his we're like just looking around
[50:27] to see what
[50:29] happens God
[50:31] says God does all he
[50:33] can to make us feel
[50:38] comfortable oh Brothers how much does he
[50:40] not
[50:41] do do to remind us to tell
[50:45] us you're my
[50:47] son I love
[50:49] you you are my
[50:52] wife I love
[50:54] you in
[50:57] us that says it can't be that it can't
[51:02] be why would he do this for
[51:04] me it can't
[51:08] be this is strange this has been a
[51:14] mistake it's a mistake to come to
[51:17] church it's a mistake
[51:21] to that you have me here with these
[51:24] people
[51:28] but he did all he
[51:31] could so that she would be
[51:37] comfortable perhaps there was a there
[51:39] was there were
[51:42] times where it appeared like everything
[51:45] was
[51:46] well she was relaxed a little
[51:51] bit and she said well maybe this is
[51:54] mine
[51:57] maybe there is the future
[52:00] here maybe I am the the the
[52:04] bride maybe he did choose
[52:09] me maybe he does love me so much like he
[52:12] tells
[52:14] me
[52:17] imagine just as those moments would
[52:21] come they would begin to fade
[52:24] away
[52:28] when she began to think on her other
[52:32] life she began to
[52:36] think in a more comfortable
[52:43] life a life with more
[52:48] luxury imagine one day when she was
[52:50] going out to the
[52:54] market
[52:55] one of her friends Drew near to
[52:58] her and said go
[53:03] go guess
[53:05] what look at those men
[53:08] there they come from
[53:11] Arabia they are wealthy men filled with
[53:15] money and they are ready to waste
[53:17] it they are
[53:20] ready to give you what you
[53:24] want
[53:25] they are ready to have a good time look
[53:28] come let me present them to you come
[53:30] over
[53:32] here perhaps wasn't expecting
[53:34] it but little by
[53:37] little she began to get involved in that
[53:42] moment to see these men with
[53:45] cologne cologne and expensive
[53:48] clothes began to speak to
[53:53] her he began to make her
[53:56] for her to go
[53:58] back to imagine her past
[54:01] life just like the devil
[54:03] does he bring he seduces us once again
[54:07] heces us again he he says
[54:10] remember
[54:12] remember yes or yes
[54:18] Brothers when she Le suspected she had a
[54:20] cup of wine in her
[54:21] hand she was tasting it again
[54:31] the days
[54:34] passed and she did not return
[54:44] home Hosea was looking for
[54:50] her he looked for her for
[54:54] days
[54:57] just like God seeks us
[55:03] out just like he looks for
[55:07] you you say well I'm in
[55:11] church that doesn't mean your heart is
[55:17] his your heart could belong to something
[55:20] else or someone
[55:24] else
[55:26] your heart could be half here and half
[55:27] in another
[55:31] place you haven't given him
[55:36] everything and he goes once
[55:39] again and he goes and and looks
[55:43] free even if they mock
[55:48] him everyone in that town they all
[55:54] knew I imagine they they they looked at
[55:56] him and they felt sorry for
[55:59] him asking him why did you set eyes on
[56:03] her why do you continue to look for
[56:11] her why does God continue trying with
[56:19] us why does God keep trying with
[56:22] me why does he keep trying with you
[56:27] even when we ignore
[56:30] him even when our heart is
[56:36] hardened even when we put other things
[56:38] before
[56:42] him even when we give more to other
[56:45] things of the world than him even we
[56:48] when we ignore
[56:53] him
[56:56] when it doesn't even matter to us what
[56:57] he
[56:59] said why does he continue to look for
[57:03] us I ask myself what the people don't
[57:05] say they wouldn't say of
[57:08] O why do you continue to seek her out
[57:12] just forget about
[57:14] her imagine the devil telling
[57:17] God why you keep looking for them he
[57:21] loves me more than
[57:23] you
[57:27] why do you continue
[57:32] trying I want to tell
[57:36] you he continues
[57:40] trying he continues looking for
[57:45] you he continues remembering you
[57:48] reminding you reminding
[57:52] you you are my bride
[57:56] you are my
[57:57] son I love
[58:03] you come back
[58:08] home give me your
[58:10] heart
[58:17] completely go would return home for a
[58:20] few days perhaps some
[58:23] months
[58:29] as she was
[58:33] pregnant well she couldn't do her job
[58:36] right she would stay
[58:42] home but her heart still wasn't
[58:49] there and when she had the
[58:53] children it feel good good
[58:57] again she would begin to think
[59:01] again
[59:07] imagine that within her she would
[59:11] say why can't I
[59:18] stay why can't I be
[59:23] faithful
[59:27] perhaps it's a question we've asked
[59:30] ourselves why can't I be
[59:35] faithful why can't I do what I know I
[59:38] should
[59:39] do have you ever asked yourself
[59:42] [Music]
[59:44] that why if he loves me so
[59:48] much he's taught me so so many
[59:52] times he's showed me his love
[59:56] he's done all he can for
[59:59] me why can't I be faithful to
[1:00:09] him
[1:00:12] why do I look for someone that's going
[1:00:14] to use
[1:00:16] me instead of someone that loves
[1:00:21] me why do we look for the things of the
[1:00:23] world
[1:00:26] when we know that the world doesn't have
[1:00:28] anything good for
[1:00:29] us why do we spend so much time on
[1:00:33] on watching things we we know we
[1:00:35] shouldn't
[1:00:37] watch listening to music we shouldn't
[1:00:39] listen
[1:00:41] to having romance with the
[1:00:47] devil when there's someone that truly
[1:00:50] loves
[1:00:52] us when there's showed us Time After
[1:01:06] Time Imagine That goer was not fully
[1:01:15] convinced that perhaps she still thought
[1:01:17] it was a
[1:01:23] mistake she said well he can't love one
[1:01:26] love someone like
[1:01:30] me you that
[1:01:33] say oh what do you say no yeah you said
[1:01:36] it right in the first
[1:01:38] time you that
[1:01:41] say he can't love someone like
[1:01:44] me I want to tell
[1:01:47] you he didn't not make a mistake with
[1:01:51] you I
[1:01:53] repeat
[1:01:55] he did not make a mistake with
[1:01:58] you if he brought you
[1:02:00] here it's because he wants you
[1:02:04] here because he's
[1:02:06] [Music]
[1:02:08] willing to do whatever it
[1:02:12] takes until you know how much he loves
[1:02:19] you so you can be a woman or a for
[1:02:23] him
[1:02:26] for a wife without
[1:02:29] spotter he is
[1:02:32] willing to do everything he
[1:02:36] can he did not make a mistake with
[1:02:45] you and he reminds us
[1:02:50] again even with all of your
[1:02:53] mistakes
[1:02:55] he REM he reminds us
[1:02:57] again even with all your
[1:03:01] mistakes I still love
[1:03:06] you and he'd be
[1:03:11] willing I'd be willing to give my life
[1:03:13] again for

[1:03:43] again the great love that I have for
[1:03:47] you because we forget very
[1:03:51] easily because we go back very easily
[1:03:55] because very
[1:04:02] easily we go back to our life without
[1:04:14] him Hosea 141
[1:04:20] says oh Israel
[1:04:23] return unto the Lord thy
[1:04:28] God for thou H has fallen by thine

[1:20:45] Lord I imagine
[1:20:51] Hosea
[1:20:53] uh leaving his
[1:20:59] house when Goomer would come
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:04] back he would grow go out and and and
[1:21:07] cry
[1:21:09] out and he would
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:15] cry getting out his anger with
[1:21:20] God to not let it out toward
[1:21:25] her and sometimes I come with you
[1:21:29] god and I say
[1:21:32] why
[1:21:33] why are we like this
[1:21:36] Lord why are we so
[1:21:45] ungrateful but this is the family you've
[1:21:48] given
[1:21:51] me
[1:21:53] these are the ones you've given
[1:21:56] me help us love one
[1:22:02] another to forgive one
[1:22:21] another these small
[1:22:24] portions they are genuine
[1:22:29] bread made without condiments and and
[1:22:32] and other
[1:22:35] things which represents the body of the
[1:22:37] lord it's not
[1:22:40] round broken in all
[1:22:44] pieces it's because that means it's
[1:22:46] broken
[1:22:48] body that was broke for
[1:22:51] us
[1:22:53] may God grant His
[1:22:55] blessings to everyone that eats
[1:22:58] it now it is not the
[1:23:01] body it only represents the
[1:23:04] body I have no
[1:23:07] power no one else
[1:23:10] does to make it anything but God
[1:23:14] alone that's what he told
[1:23:17] us to eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:23:20] of
[1:23:21] wine
[1:23:25] I would ask for them to um pass the
[1:23:28] bread and the
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:37] wine don't eat it uh when you get it
[1:23:40] just
[1:23:41] yet we will be partaking of it
[1:23:46] together this
[1:23:51] bread
[1:23:53] is the body of it represents the body of
[1:23:56] the
[1:23:58] Lord it just doesn't represent his
[1:24:01] broken
[1:24:03] body because before his body was
[1:24:07] broken his heart was
[1:24:10] broken but that it would represent a
[1:24:13] broken
[1:24:15] body it would a broken heart for
[1:24:21] us if you won't partake of it don't
[1:24:24] worry just don't take
[1:24:38] it be careful with the
[1:24:42] wine and if you need grape
[1:24:46] juice you can get grape
[1:24:49] juice the rest is wine
[1:24:57] think on him for a
[1:25:02] moment think out what he wants to remind
[1:25:05] you
[1:25:08] of what does he want to remind you of
[1:25:10] this
[1:25:11] evening perhaps you already
[1:25:16] forgot all that he's done for
[1:25:21] you
[1:25:25] maybe you forgot that he how many times
[1:25:27] he told you he loved
[1:25:31] you maybe you've forgotten of his
[1:25:35] Mercy how many times he's picked you
[1:25:39] up how many times you've been ready to
[1:25:43] quit and he has sent something to pick
[1:25:46] you up for someone to pick you
[1:25:50] up maybe we've forgotten
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:25:56] of his
[1:26:01] benefits what it is to be in his
[1:26:07] presence how beautiful it is to
[1:26:11] [Music]
[1:26:18] feel if you're not going to take it
[1:26:20] don't worry don't grab it
[1:26:23] but maybe we've
[1:26:29] forgotten what it is to be in his
[1:26:34] arms maybe we
[1:26:37] forgotten the promises we made unto
[1:26:42] him why don't you take a moment to
[1:26:48] remember
[1:26:51] remember
[1:26:52] what you would be without
[1:26:55] him where would you be without
[1:26:59] him where would you be if he had not
[1:27:02] saved
[1:27:08] you where would you and I
[1:27:13] be what would be of our lives without
[1:27:21] him
