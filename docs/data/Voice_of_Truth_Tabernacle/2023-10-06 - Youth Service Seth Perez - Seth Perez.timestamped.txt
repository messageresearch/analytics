[47:41] the
[47:43] confidence my pastor for the
[47:46] confidence amen amen so the story we
[47:50] took the scripture
[47:53] from is a story
[47:56] that you may have heard
[47:59] before and it talks of this
[48:02] woman her name was
[48:05] Hannah see Hannah had a
[48:09] husband and her husband had another
[48:12] wife and that wife had many
[48:17] children and every
[48:19] year they would go to the house of the
[48:23] Lord and they would go to the priest
[48:28] Eli and they would Worship the
[48:31] Lord but Hannah desired a
[48:36] [Music]
[48:38] son there was a desire placed in her
[48:42] heart that
[48:44] not the desire I believe was placed
[48:47] there by
[48:50] God and year after
[48:53] year the husband would give them
[48:57] portions to give unto the
[49:00] Lord but Hannah want wanted something a
[49:02] little bit
[49:04] more she wanted to f f fulfill her
[49:07] motherly
[49:10] duties she wanted to train a child in
[49:13] the ways of the
[49:18] Lord she wanted to dedicate
[49:23] something she wanted a vow a
[49:27] vow because
[49:29] Hannah had got so desperate in the
[49:32] things of this
[49:35] thing that it just tore her
[49:38] up she was just crying to the Lord one
[49:43] day H have you ever done anything like
[49:48] that maybe there's something that you
[49:50] see your brother
[49:54] receiving
[49:56] and maybe year after year you could say
[49:58] okay that's
[50:01] fine but then it's like when is it my
[50:04] [Music]
[50:06] turn am I talking to any of the youth
[50:10] today is there something that you desire
[50:13] of the
[50:14] Lord maybe it's not a
[50:17] son but there's something groaning
[50:20] inside of
[50:22] you something that something that you
[50:25] want to birth
[50:28] out and we'll get into
[50:31] that you know she couldn't have the
[50:35] children but she made a vow to the
[50:39] Lord she said
[50:41] Lord if you give me a
[50:44] son I will return it back to
[50:49] you kind of a little hard sometimes
[50:53] right Lord if you give me a new
[50:58] Xbox I might start clapping my hands in
[51:04] church Lord I need a new
[51:08] car so I can go to the
[51:12] game but no she wanted to give something
[51:15] to the
[51:18] Lord Lord if you give something to
[51:21] me in my
[51:23] heart the desire is
[51:26] right sometimes we have the wrong
[51:29] desire but Lord look at my
[51:32] heart look at the desire in my
[51:36] heart cuz as soon as you give it to
[51:38] [Music]
[51:40] me I want to give it back to
[51:43] you I will give unto
[51:45] you all the days of his
[51:50] life and no razor should should come
[51:52] upon his
[51:54] head
[51:56] wow what what future that this child had
[52:00] right in one sense he didn't have a
[52:05] choice one
[52:07] sense but his mama brought him to
[52:12] church when he was old
[52:15] enough brought him to the feet of
[52:18] Eli and said you know my my my
[52:23] petition you know what the Lord did for
[52:25] me
[52:27] I'm bringing my I'm dedicating my son to
[52:30] the
[52:32] Lord and this is wasn't something that
[52:35] they brought him to church one
[52:39] day and then she left with him to their
[52:42] home no she left him at
[52:49] church who is this
[52:51] boy does anybody know who this this boy
[52:54] is
[52:58] this is Samuel we're talking about
[53:01] right a prophet of the
[53:03] Lord not just
[53:06] anybody when she vowed a
[53:10] vow to have a razor not touch his
[53:16] head she was fulfilling the guidelines
[53:19] of a Nazarite
[53:23] vow you might be familiar with that
[53:27] right the
[53:32] Nazarite they weren't able to they were
[53:36] guided to not drink any strong
[53:43] drink they were told that they must wear
[53:45] their hair
[53:49] long and don't go to any near dead
[53:54] bodies they were told to be
[53:59] separated separated the
[54:04] Israelites the special ones would do
[54:08] this for a purpose to consecrate
[54:12] themselves to the
[54:14] Lord but they wanted not just to
[54:17] separate from their brothers per
[54:21] se it was a special
[54:24] purpose
[54:26] to not just separate from my brother
[54:29] here it was to say to the
[54:33] Lord I hear your
[54:36] commandment I am separating
[54:41] myself unto you
[54:43] Lord and the Israelites that would see
[54:47] these brothers that would take this
[54:51] vow it was very obvious to them
[54:56] who was doing
[54:58] it I see the
[55:01] ladies they wear the long
[55:04] hair and the long
[55:07] dress many times it's so easy to see
[55:12] them you go to the
[55:14] store you see a lady with long hair and
[55:17] a
[55:19] dress you think why I think there's a
[55:22] bunch there's some Believers around here
[55:24] somewhere
[55:26] are you a
[55:27] Christian oh okay yeah yeah everybody
[55:30] knows
[55:31] this the world knows this cuz you look a
[55:34] little
[55:35] different even the devil knows this and
[55:39] he likes to
[55:41] look hold on
[55:43] guys come on demon
[55:46] friends I want you to keep an eye on
[55:48] these ones right
[55:51] here they look a little
[55:54] different
[55:56] for the
[55:57] guys sometimes it's not very easy to see
[56:01] because we don't all have long hair
[56:06] right it's not talking so much about
[56:08] your long hair
[56:10] phally more of
[56:14] spiritually what did the angel tell
[56:16] brother
[56:19] branam don't ever
[56:21] drink or

[58:35] bit because one of them

[58:46] or taking off from
[58:51] work cuz we're going to go do a work of
[58:53] the Lord

[58:59] there with my brothers and
[59:02] sisters when they said let us go into
[59:04] the
[59:05] house a Voice of Truth
[59:08] Tabernacle Voice of Truth
[59:12] Tabernacle we're going to dedicate a
[59:14] building
[59:16] here doesn't it thrill your
[59:19] soul for all the hard work that you put
[59:23] in Church looks
[59:26] beautiful but even
[59:29] so I see a lot of work that you've been
[59:31] putting in the
[59:33] members that this ministry has been
[59:35] putting in the people of God
[59:38] here that the young people have been
[59:42] feeding Friday
[59:44] night I see you and I want to say Well
[59:49] done you should give yourself an
[59:53] Applause
[59:59] I'm a p I'm privileged to be able to
[1:00:02] work with the young people in Las
[1:00:07] Cruses a
[1:00:09] privilege and I'll
[1:00:11] smile because sometimes they look at
[1:00:14] me and say hey are you happy to be here
[1:00:20] sth but I want to let you know I'm very
[1:00:23] happy nothing more that I want to do in
[1:00:27] this
[1:00:29] world because of the great parents that
[1:00:32] I
[1:00:33] had that they're sitting right here
[1:00:37] today if you would see
[1:00:39] me I don't try to Puff myself
[1:00:43] up but my parents have had a great
[1:00:48] hand in the way I was grown
[1:00:51] up in the way that I was trained
[1:00:55] because they love the Lord with all
[1:00:57] their
[1:00:59] heart they're very Godly
[1:01:02] Parents and sometimes when I don't do
[1:01:05] something
[1:01:07] right they're not
[1:01:10] afraid to take me to God's
[1:01:12] [Music]
[1:01:13] word and gave me a
[1:01:18] spanking I used to get spanking a lot
[1:01:20] when I was a
[1:01:23] child
[1:01:25] and as I look back on my
[1:01:27] life I deserved each
[1:01:31] one but I'm thankful for the
[1:01:34] parents because they brought me to
[1:01:37] church and that my father would
[1:01:40] say as long as you live in my
[1:01:44] house we're going to
[1:01:46] church as long as you live in my house
[1:01:49] we're going to praise the
[1:01:51] Lord even when he don't want to
[1:01:57] and how dare
[1:01:59] I say Dad I'm tired of going to
[1:02:04] church because you know what would
[1:02:08] happen and this wouldn't mean much much
[1:02:10] to
[1:02:12] me until I would get a little
[1:02:15] older you see the prophet
[1:02:20] samel the more time he spent in
[1:02:23] church
[1:02:24] at the
[1:02:26] temple they might have dropped him off
[1:02:28] when he was about four years
[1:02:30] old the Bible says as soon as she weaned
[1:02:33] him
[1:02:36] off would you drop your child
[1:02:41] off but I was brought here to
[1:02:44] church and I would sit in the
[1:02:46] back and I always would see my father
[1:02:50] singing at the
[1:02:53] pulpit and the Lord would just move when
[1:02:55] he would
[1:02:57] sing the Lord still
[1:03:00] does and I would sit
[1:03:02] down and sometimes I would
[1:03:05] say Lord I want
[1:03:08] that maybe I'm a bad kid at
[1:03:12] home I don't know
[1:03:14] everything but something I want to sing
[1:03:16] to you
[1:03:19] Lord and I just had my grandfather would
[1:03:22] always tell me
[1:03:25] when you would
[1:03:26] sing open your heart to the
[1:03:31] Lord so you grow
[1:03:34] older Samuel will grow older and he
[1:03:37] would
[1:03:38] Minister but yet the word of the Lord
[1:03:40] didn't come to him
[1:03:42] yet until finally he would hear
[1:03:44] something
[1:03:48] saying
[1:03:50] Samuel Samuel Samuel Samuel Samuel do
[1:03:53] you remember remember when the Lord has
[1:03:54] called
[1:03:56] you do you remember how it
[1:03:58] felt do you remember how I
[1:04:04] felt and I was just like Samuel I felt
[1:04:08] I I I could have align with this
[1:04:13] story and Samuel would go to
[1:04:17] Eli you here I am Eli you called for me
[1:04:21] right well it wasn't me no
[1:04:25] Samuel
[1:04:27] Samuel here I am
[1:04:29] Eli what do you need of
[1:04:33] me that wasn't me
[1:04:36] Samuel go back to your
[1:04:38] room Samuel Samuel Samu Sam here I am
[1:04:45] Eli well that wasn't me go back to your
[1:04:49] room and on that third try he he finally
[1:04:52] figured out what was going on
[1:04:57] and he said go go back to your room and
[1:04:59] let us read
[1:05:01] that and the Lord came and
[1:05:05] stood 1 Samuel
[1:05:09] 3:10 and called at other
[1:05:13] times Samuel
[1:05:20] Samuel and as Eli's
[1:05:23] instructions
[1:05:24] he said
[1:05:26] speak for thy servant
[1:05:30] heareth you see he must remembered what
[1:05:32] his mama
[1:05:35] did but now it comes to a point in our
[1:05:38] lives as young
[1:05:41] people your parents can bring you to
[1:05:44] church kicking and
[1:05:48] screaming and maybe you don't want
[1:05:51] it but I urge you to not
[1:05:56] open your heart to the
[1:05:59] Lord why do these
[1:06:02] people I would always
[1:06:04] ask why does my
[1:06:06] father my
[1:06:08] grandfather my
[1:06:10] Theos why do they work so hard for the
[1:06:15] Lord without
[1:06:17] complaint I never heard them
[1:06:21] complain I got to go help God's children
[1:06:26] even if it was during the
[1:06:28] night because they open themselves to
[1:06:31] the
[1:06:33] Lord they were brought up
[1:06:36] right they dedicated themselves to the
[1:06:41] Lord they were separated from the
[1:06:45] world because their purpose was not to
[1:06:48] act like the
[1:06:50] world and your purpose tonight young
[1:06:53] people
[1:06:56] no matter how much you kick and
[1:06:59] complain you g the you gripe and
[1:07:05] moan when they say we're going to go
[1:07:09] have service Friday night in Las
[1:07:14] Cruses they didn't
[1:07:17] complain cuz they made up their
[1:07:22] mind and let us go
[1:07:26] as another one in the Bible who took
[1:07:29] this
[1:07:31] vow you heard about a man named
[1:07:34] Samson you heard about him and how his
[1:07:40] parents they presented him to the Lord
[1:07:42] with a Nazarite
[1:07:44] vow don't let the razor come upon your
[1:07:48] head let it
[1:07:50] happen don't drink the strong drink
[1:07:55] we need you Samson we need you
[1:07:59] Samson because there's a purpose for you
[1:08:01] when you get
[1:08:04] older well maybe Samson would
[1:08:08] say as a youth why does have to be my
[1:08:13] job I don't want to do
[1:08:15] it let somebody else let somebody else's
[1:08:19] problem I want to do something else I
[1:08:23] want to fulfill my own
[1:08:25] desires and as the Lord would come upon
[1:08:30] him because he had the Nazarite
[1:08:34] vow he would just go and Bully the
[1:08:37] Philistines all
[1:08:40] around the gift he had inside of
[1:08:44] him was to tear down the
[1:08:48] Philistines there was no King that in
[1:08:51] that
[1:08:51] day only judges
[1:08:55] and the Lord raised him
[1:08:56] up put the desire on his parents'
[1:09:01] heart and Sansum grew he
[1:09:05] grew and he did what the Lord
[1:09:08] commanded but only just because he
[1:09:11] commanded it wasn't something in his
[1:09:14] heart that he did it
[1:09:17] from Just because of the pressure of the
[1:09:20] parents maybe we serve the Lord
[1:09:24] not because we want
[1:09:26] to but because maybe my daddy is a
[1:09:28] minister in this
[1:09:30] church my daddy is a
[1:09:33] pastor I had to do it or I'll get in
[1:09:37] trouble and Samson wanted to go to the
[1:09:42] world that was his
[1:09:45] desire right and who did he go
[1:09:49] to when he go to the
[1:09:51] world the world has opened up arms for
[1:09:55] youve been waiting for
[1:09:58] you come on
[1:10:00] Samson and a pretty girl appeared to
[1:10:03] him has a pretty girl appeared to
[1:10:07] you a pretty
[1:10:12] boy and the world would love Samson and
[1:10:17] Samson loved to flirt with the
[1:10:22] world
[1:10:24] in a drop of a
[1:10:25] hat he would said Lord he commissioned
[1:10:28] me for a
[1:10:30] purpose and they would say Samson the
[1:10:32] Philistines are beating beating the
[1:10:34] Israelites
[1:10:38] up all right give me a second and he
[1:10:41] would take care of
[1:10:43] it but it wasn't truly what was in his
[1:10:46] heart yet
[1:10:50] yet until the that woman Delight
[1:10:55] she wanted to know something about
[1:10:59] Samson because the world's tired of the
[1:11:02] ministry beating up the
[1:11:07] devil they're just a little
[1:11:10] tired and so let's send someone that
[1:11:12] could maybe break down Samson's
[1:11:18] defenses you know Satan wants to break
[1:11:21] your
[1:11:22] defenses when you make a stand for the
[1:11:25] Lord he's trying to entice
[1:11:29] you he wants your
[1:11:31] heart Satan does he wants that I see how
[1:11:36] hard he's working for the
[1:11:39] Lord I want him to work for
[1:11:42] me I can promise him
[1:11:45] anything so Delilah went to
[1:11:48] Samson tell me your secret
[1:11:52] Samson where does your your strength
[1:11:55] lie come on Samson I need to
[1:11:59] know I want it to I want it
[1:12:03] too well and he gave him gave her some
[1:12:06] riddles
[1:12:08] right you know the
[1:12:11] story he wanted to know where the
[1:12:13] strength
[1:12:15] lith because Satan
[1:12:19] knows he
[1:12:20] knows There Is Power
[1:12:24] of a vow that's
[1:12:27] kept and the longer you keep
[1:12:31] it the longer you keep
[1:12:34] it the stronger it
[1:12:37] gets it is a
[1:12:40] sacrifice where you have to separate
[1:12:42] yourself from
[1:12:45] unbelief where you have to separates
[1:12:48] yourself from the things of the
[1:12:51] world and it's hard
[1:12:54] when your desire is
[1:12:58] worldly and you're trying to serve two
[1:13:04] masters but being dedicated to one
[1:13:09] thing is not hard when you put your
[1:13:13] whole heart into
[1:13:14] it when you make your
[1:13:17] decision from the depths of your
[1:13:20] soul that as for me and my heart
[1:13:24] house we will serve the Lord
[1:13:28] forever but hey your job is not going to
[1:13:31] be
[1:13:33] there you're not going to have any
[1:13:35] friends the kids at school are not going
[1:13:38] to say you're
[1:13:39] [Music]
[1:13:41] popular did you make a decision in your
[1:13:46] heart well that's why we're here
[1:13:49] tonight if you haven't made that
[1:13:52] decision
[1:13:53] the Lord is
[1:13:55] here and the
[1:13:58] ministry they're like the
[1:14:02] coaches they're here to encourage
[1:14:04] you make the
[1:14:07] decision you have life or
[1:14:10] death but the Bible tells
[1:14:13] you choose
[1:14:15] life choose it choose
[1:14:19] life but sometimes we can't get out of
[1:14:21] our own way when we're young people
[1:14:25] and
[1:14:26] Samson couldn't get out of his
[1:14:29] way and he told the secret to
[1:14:33] Delila my strength
[1:14:37] lith in the locks of my
[1:14:41] hair you see because when I was
[1:14:45] born the Lord dedicated to me dedicated
[1:14:48] me to the
[1:14:50] Lord and I took the vow
[1:14:53] this is how she raised
[1:14:55] me and my hair was
[1:14:59] long so you know the
[1:15:03] story
[1:15:04] that they came
[1:15:07] in and they cut off his
[1:15:10] locks and maybe
[1:15:12] tonight your parents dedicated you to
[1:15:15] the
[1:15:17] Lord and you may have
[1:15:19] said but I lost my joy for the
[1:15:23] things of the
[1:15:26] Lord I don't have strength to go help
[1:15:28] the
[1:15:30] pastor I'm just not feeling
[1:15:33] it it it doesn't do anything for
[1:15:37] me go help brother
[1:15:41] Seth I
[1:15:43] guess and maybe the desire is not there
[1:15:47] anymore because you lost the joy of the
[1:15:51] Lord the joy of the the Lord is my
[1:15:55] strength you forgot your original
[1:15:57] purpose in
[1:16:00] life and maybe your eyes were plucked
[1:16:02] out just like
[1:16:06] Samson's and you feel that the Lord
[1:16:08] can't help me
[1:16:11] anymore and you're just
[1:16:15] groaning maybe in a bad place in your
[1:16:19] life where you don't think the Lord
[1:16:22] wants you anymore
[1:16:25] how could anybody help
[1:16:27] me for the evil that I have
[1:16:31] done when when my sin is soever before
[1:16:37] me but just
[1:16:39] wait you might be struggling here
[1:16:42] tonight but the Lord is
[1:16:45] here and give it
[1:16:47] time keep coming to
[1:16:50] church even when you don't want to
[1:16:53] oh man service
[1:16:55] [Music]
[1:16:58] again but sometimes you got to just talk
[1:17:01] to
[1:17:03] yourself you can't expect nobody else to
[1:17:06] do
[1:17:07] it maybe you hear somebody
[1:17:10] else it's like when uh the parents tell
[1:17:13] something to the
[1:17:15] kids you should do
[1:17:17] this this will solve your
[1:17:20] problem yeah whatever
[1:17:24] they don't know what they're talking
[1:17:26] about and then another person comes over
[1:17:29] to
[1:17:30] you and tells you the same
[1:17:33] thing you should do
[1:17:35] this because this is how you get past
[1:17:38] your
[1:17:41] obstacle why didn't I think of
[1:17:43] that where did you come up with that
[1:17:47] from golly what inspiration you
[1:17:50] have I'm going to listen
[1:17:53] I'm going to
[1:17:54] listen why do we do that
[1:17:58] because that's how kids
[1:18:01] are I'm my new
[1:18:05] parent but the locks hold something for
[1:18:10] you they did something for
[1:18:14] Samson as he was just being beat up by
[1:18:16] the
[1:18:19] Philistines I can't see
[1:18:21] anything someone lead
[1:18:24] me I'm good for
[1:18:27] nothing that dirty
[1:18:29] woman she tricked me she didn't want
[1:18:32] anything to do with
[1:18:34] me and the world really doesn't care
[1:18:36] about
[1:18:38] you let me
[1:18:42] rephrase the world
[1:18:46] absolutely doesn't care about
[1:18:49] you about who you are only just because
[1:18:54] they want you to not fulfill your
[1:18:59] purpose it's all a distraction
[1:19:02] G they don't want to know who you
[1:19:06] are and what you they don't want you to
[1:19:09] know who you
[1:19:10] are they want to pluck your eyes
[1:19:13] out maybe we could tear them up that
[1:19:17] way they want to pluck your spiritual
[1:19:20] eyes
[1:19:21] out
[1:19:23] but at last time I
[1:19:26] checked since we're born in the
[1:19:30] message it is a
[1:19:32] privilege like no
[1:19:35] other and I didn't realize this and when
[1:19:38] I was a young
[1:19:41] child but as you
[1:19:43] grow and you go places you talk to
[1:19:47] different
[1:19:48] people and you're just
[1:19:51] different but I'm a Christian
[1:19:55] too that is
[1:19:57] weird because when I go to
[1:20:01] church the Lord called me to be
[1:20:05] different just come out to drink with
[1:20:08] us the Bible don't say
[1:20:12] that it says don't
[1:20:15] defile your body in any way don't
[1:20:21] drink want to be
[1:20:24] different the Lord's calling you to be
[1:20:27] different you're not like anybody
[1:20:30] else you're a chosen
[1:20:35] people a chosen
[1:20:40] generation you are
[1:20:42] beautiful in the sight of
[1:20:45] God in this day and
[1:20:47] age he doesn't want you to be the same
[1:20:50] like other churches
[1:20:54] bride is not the
[1:20:56] same because when they believe the
[1:21:01] Lord they do it with all their
[1:21:04] hearts they took a Nazarite
[1:21:08] vow and every child of
[1:21:12] Abraham every child of
[1:21:15] Abraham when he comes to the Lord he
[1:21:18] takes that Nazarite
[1:21:20] V you were called to be different young
[1:21:24] people
[1:21:26] know not to be
[1:21:30] weirdos different from the
[1:21:35] world does it throw your soul to be
[1:21:37] called
[1:21:39] different come on young people do you
[1:21:42] want to be different do you want to look
[1:21:45] the
[1:21:46] same cuz the Lord told
[1:21:48] you come on and step on
[1:21:51] now step on
[1:21:55] out separate yourself come on separate
[1:22:00] yourself we don't do those things we got
[1:22:03] a higher purpose here on Earth do you
[1:22:06] know what your purpose
[1:22:09] is when I was a young purpose uh young
[1:22:13] person I would always ask myself
[1:22:16] that Lord what purpose would I
[1:22:20] have and I was so busy
[1:22:24] living up to my
[1:22:28] parents until into instead
[1:22:31] of living to
[1:22:35] God they taught me to have fear the
[1:22:39] lord which is a great
[1:22:41] thing but you have to seek the
[1:22:45] Lord the
[1:22:47] parents as much as they wanted me to be
[1:22:50] a certain
[1:22:51] way
[1:22:54] and to get it
[1:22:57] instantaneous as much as I want the
[1:22:59] young people to get it like
[1:23:03] that it doesn't happen
[1:23:06] such but it takes an action from each
[1:23:10] and every one of
[1:23:12] you I can preach everything until my
[1:23:15] voice goes
[1:23:17] out and I will because I love you so
[1:23:20] much I love each and every one of you
[1:23:23] not just the young
[1:23:25] people because the Lord loved me when he
[1:23:29] called
[1:23:31] me I would go and is is that is that
[1:23:34] what is the Lord calling
[1:23:37] me why would he call
[1:23:39] me and they would say go listen
[1:23:42] again go listen again stay in
[1:23:46] church get the word inside of
[1:23:49] you eat this all
[1:23:51] up it's a little
[1:23:54] boring I don't understand it
[1:23:57] yet but as I as I
[1:24:01] turn I just kept
[1:24:04] pushing and pushing and they would
[1:24:07] describe it to
[1:24:08] me but one day I had to have my own
[1:24:12] personal
[1:24:15] experience you have to have your own
[1:24:17] personal experience with
[1:24:20] God and it's a choice that I can't even
[1:24:22] make for
[1:24:25] you and today if you hear the voice of
[1:24:28] the
[1:24:29] Lord if you hear him knocking on your
[1:24:35] heart I challenge
[1:24:37] you open your heart to the
[1:24:40] Lord we open we have no problem opening
[1:24:43] ourselves to
[1:24:45] anything or everything that the world
[1:24:47] gives
[1:24:48] us but I challenge you
[1:24:51] tonight
[1:24:52] open yourself to the
[1:24:55] Lord let it let him talk to you
[1:25:00] tonight because
[1:25:02] Paul knew something about the Nazarite
[1:25:05] V he
[1:25:08] knew that you have to surrender yourself
[1:25:10] to the
[1:25:12] Lord he knew that he had to crucify his
[1:25:15] old
[1:25:18] man he would always want to die
[1:25:23] to
[1:25:24] himself so that the Lord can be
[1:25:26] resurrected in his
[1:25:28] life so that the Lord could use
[1:25:32] him and he would tell
[1:25:34] you I beseech you
[1:25:37] therefore Brethren Romans
[1:25:41] 121 by the mercies of God that ye
[1:25:45] present your bodies a Living
[1:25:49] Sacrifice holy accept able unto the Lord
[1:25:53] which is your reasonable
[1:26:05] service oh it's
[1:26:08] hard because you're trying how can you
[1:26:10] live and be sacrificed at the same
[1:26:14] time sure it's hard but he says I urge
[1:26:19] you if you do nothing in this world
[1:26:23] I urge
[1:26:24] you as the number one
[1:26:28] priority
[1:26:30] behold
[1:26:32] attention I beseech
[1:26:34] you you want to make your life easier on
[1:26:39] yourself present yourself to the
[1:26:41] Lord I've been coming to church since I
[1:26:44] was a
[1:26:45] kid but maybe your heart is not in
[1:26:49] church I've been in the message since I
[1:26:51] was born
[1:26:53] but let the
[1:26:55] message come into
[1:26:58] you let it come and fill your
[1:27:02] heart it is our Prophet William Bram
[1:27:06] Willam who who saw
[1:27:09] you in the
[1:27:11] vision and he
[1:27:14] himself separated
[1:27:17] himself for you he sacrificed himself
[1:27:21] for you
[1:27:23] when he may have thought he was all
[1:27:24] alone at
[1:27:26] some but look at you now I think when he
[1:27:30] would see
[1:27:32] it when he would see
[1:27:34] you oh it would do him so
[1:27:37] good know you not that your body is the
[1:27:39] Temple of the Holy
[1:27:43] Ghost which is in you you have of God
[1:27:48] and ye are not your
[1:27:51] own
[1:27:53] you are not your
[1:27:55] own but I tell you
[1:27:57] today you are not your
[1:28:00] own but I want to do this and I want to
[1:28:04] do that and I want to go be a great
[1:28:09] somebody you're not your
[1:28:12] own as he would stand you are not your
[1:28:19] own don't let that frighten you
[1:28:23] because because you should be
[1:28:26] excited that you're
[1:28:29] his you're his
[1:28:32] today and he wants you to know
[1:28:34] that but he wants you to make the
[1:28:37] decision
[1:28:38] today to open your heart to the
[1:28:42] Lord to reach out to
[1:28:45] him and say Lord with everything that I
[1:28:48] [Music]
[1:28:49] have I separate myself
[1:28:53] I want to give you of myself today
[1:28:58] Lord the world doesn't understand
[1:29:01] it why would you
[1:29:03] fast what are you doing that
[1:29:05] for why do you pray to
[1:29:08] God why do you go to church all the
[1:29:11] time as the musicians would come why do
[1:29:14] you do all these
[1:29:16] things cuz my life is not my
[1:29:20] own my life is not my
[1:29:24] own for a period of time I thought it
[1:29:28] was and I try to run away from the
[1:29:31] things of the
[1:29:34] Lord but when I made it my
[1:29:39] choice it made everything
[1:29:42] easier because I was
[1:29:45] single-minded my eyes were open to look
[1:29:47] upon
[1:29:48] him my ear did yield to him
[1:29:53] it did yield to the
[1:29:56] Lord and I said
[1:29:58] Lord this is the day that I have
[1:30:02] died tired of running
[1:30:05] Lord Would You Close Your Eyes young
[1:30:09] people maybe you haven't gotten there
[1:30:12] yet maybe you already gave your heart to
[1:30:14] the
[1:30:16] Lord but the Lord is still calling for
[1:30:18] those that are
[1:30:20] lost is
[1:30:25] here he is
[1:30:28] here you don't have to fear
[1:30:32] anymore you don't even have to worry
[1:30:34] about
[1:30:35] tomorrow but the one thing that you have
[1:30:37] to worry
[1:30:40] about is what you do right now with the
[1:30:45] Lord and he wants you
[1:30:48] tonight Lord
[1:30:50] Jesus
[1:30:54] I said everything that you wanted me to
[1:30:56] say
