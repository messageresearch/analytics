[17:14] [Music]
[17:21] God bless you
[17:23] all good to be in the house of God
[17:25] tonight
[17:27] amen amen if you can open up your Bibles
[17:30] with me to the Book of
[17:35] Matthew chapter
[17:37] 3 and verse
[17:46] 16 amen go ahead and read
[17:51] it it reads like this it says when he
[17:55] had been baptized Jesus came up
[17:57] immediately from the the water and
[17:59] behold the heavens were open to him and
[18:01] he saw the spirit of God descending like
[18:04] a dove and the lighting upon
[18:26] Him amen goe and jump to chapter
[18:31] 4 and then just read the first verse
[18:35] here reads like
[18:37] this it says then Jesus was led up by
[18:41] the spirit Into the Wilderness to be
[18:43] tempted by the
[18:49] devil we can bow our
[18:51] heads dear heavenly
[18:53] father Lord Jesus in this
[18:56] night God we ask ask that you just be
[18:58] with us
[19:00] father and that you just come and speak
[19:02] words of eternal life to us
[19:05] Lord come Lord Jesus and have your way
[19:07] with us
[19:10] tonight and may you prepare our hearts
[19:12] to receive your word tonight Lord
[19:16] Jesus Lord we just ask you be with us
[19:18] God and that your will be done in this
[19:22] service in the name of the Lord Jesus
[19:25] Christ amen amen amen you can have your
[19:31] seats amen we're going to be talking
[19:33] about
[19:36] Jesus and more specifically about um him
[19:39] overcoming in the desert
[19:42] [Music]
[19:44] amen and as a title along with my
[19:49] brothers we placed Overcoming By the
[19:54] word
[19:56] amen uh we just read read here in
[19:58] Matthew chapter
[20:01] 3 that is spoke of how Jesus was
[20:04] baptized
[20:06] amen and I think for
[20:09] anybody it's a turning point in your
[20:13] life to get
[20:17] baptized I I think it was a turning
[20:19] point in Jesus's
[20:22] life because that's where he received
[20:24] the Holy
[20:27] Spirit and I think that was a moment of
[20:29] victory for him
[20:31] amen is when he was baptized by the
[20:36] Lord and he was able to feel God's
[20:40] presence amen and I think that it it
[20:42] made it so much
[20:45] easier um that he was able to feel God's
[20:49] presence but not only
[20:52] that but that he was surrounded by his
[20:54] brothers
[20:56] amen he was in the presence of other
[21:01] people amen now I find it
[21:06] interesting how God baptizes Jesus or
[21:10] has Jesus to be
[21:13] baptized and then right
[21:17] after
[21:18] God God himself leads Jesus to be
[21:21] tempted
[21:25] amen and I believe to truly
[21:30] overcome uh you overcome
[21:33] alone uh you you don't truly overcome
[21:36] when you're with your brothers and your
[21:40] sisters it's a lot easier to overcome
[21:43] and fight with you guys
[21:45] Brothers it's a lot easier to overcome
[21:47] with you
[21:50] guys but I know that when I leave
[21:53] tonight it's going to be up to me alone
[21:57] amen
[21:59] um even though I have my dad at
[22:02] home I won't be able to
[22:05] overcome based on his experiences
[22:10] amen I have to live the life
[22:13] myself amen amen amen so God leads
[22:19] Jesus out into the
[22:22] Wilderness amen so we can
[22:24] see that Jesus also knew what it felt to
[22:27] be
[22:30] alone amen and I want to read here in
[22:33] John chapter
[22:37] 16 verse
[22:42] 32 and it says like
[22:45] this it says behold the hour cometh yah
[22:49] is now come that ye shall be scattered
[22:53] every man to his own and shall leave me
[22:56] alone and yet I am not alone because the
[23:00] father is with me
[23:14] amen this really spoke to
[23:17] me because a lot of times I feel
[23:21] alone but I I like that the Lord Jesus
[23:24] was able to
[23:26] realize
[23:29] that he says ye shall leave me
[23:33] alone and yet I am not
[23:37] alone because the father is with me
[23:41] amen amen so often times though we feel
[23:45] alone and we feel that we're fighting
[23:49] alone because maybe dad isn't
[23:52] there because maybe your mom isn't
[23:55] there or you don't have that support
[23:57] group
[24:00] but I want to let you know that although
[24:01] you might feel
[24:05] alone you are not
[24:07] alone because the father is with you
[24:11] amen amen and I really find it
[24:15] interesting how the one of the first
[24:17] things Jesus was
[24:21] taught in the beginning of his
[24:25] ministry which is right here in chapter
[24:27] 4 where he
[24:29] read is that you have to fight alone
[24:34] amen and I think that's really important
[24:36] for us to
[24:39] realize is that God will fight alongside
[24:43] us and God will fight for us at
[24:47] times but he won't do all the fighting
[24:50] for
[24:52] us we have to pull our own
[24:56] we we have to get up every morning and
[24:59] live the life ourselves
[25:02] amen and I think that one thing that's
[25:04] also important to clear
[25:07] up is that Jesus started
[25:11] alone and he ended
[25:15] alone amen and it'll be no different for
[25:19] us amen we have to start we have to make
[25:21] the decision to choose
[25:25] Christ and at the end of the day to it's
[25:28] going to be us alone again choosing
[25:30] Christ
[25:32] amen amen so we're talking about
[25:37] Overcomers now we know that in order to
[25:40] be an
[25:42] overcomer there must be something to
[25:46] overcome amen and I want to read this
[25:48] quote uh from brother
[25:51] brandham it's in the the message the
[25:54] marriage of the
[25:56] Lamb
[26:01] and it's preached in
[26:04] 62 and it says like
[26:07] this it says if you notice it
[26:10] said she had made herself
[26:15] ready so many says so many
[26:19] says if the Lord will take this evil
[26:22] spirit from
[26:24] me from
[26:26] drinking or from
[26:28] Ling or from lying or stealing I'll
[26:32] serve him
[26:34] amen but that's up to
[26:38] you you got to do something
[26:41] too and then he says they that overcome
[26:44] shall inherit all
[26:48] things they that
[26:51] overcome you have power to do
[26:54] it but you must be willing to lay it
[27:00] down amen we have to make that decision
[27:03] in our lives
[27:05] Brothers I don't know how for how long
[27:08] I've
[27:11] waited uh coming to
[27:13] church waiting for the preacher to say
[27:16] something to change my
[27:20] life and I I have heard a lot of great
[27:23] messages
[27:25] amen but I'll keep waiting
[27:28] for that right
[27:30] moment I'll keep waiting for the
[27:32] preacher to say the right thing
[27:36] amen and I'll stay sitting
[27:39] down in my seat waiting for that
[27:43] moment because that moment will never
[27:45] come
[27:47] amen there's not a right
[27:49] moment there's only now
[27:52] amen it's only right now to make the
[27:56] decision wa waiting for the right
[27:59] moment is like waiting for the past to
[28:02] come back and and and and redo itself or
[28:04] undo itself
[28:08] amen there's there's no point in
[28:11] it amen amen now I kind of want to get
[28:14] into how we
[28:17] overcome in Revelations 1211
[28:22] inaly it says like
[28:25] this it says
[28:27] and they overcame him by the blood of
[28:30] the lamb and by the word of their
[28:40] testimony amen so how did we
[28:45] overcome because we have to believe that
[28:47] we've already overcome
[28:49] amen there's no better way to win
[28:53] amen than when you already know you
[28:56] won
[28:58] I feel like that's the best way to win
[29:01] amen maybe it's
[29:04] cheating but if I know the table is
[29:11] rigged and if it's in my
[29:13] favor I'm going all out
[29:17] amen because I
[29:19] know at the end of the day what's
[29:21] goingon to
[29:22] happen so I think that you ought to live
[29:25] the same
[29:26] way
[29:27] when your head is lifted from the pillow
[29:29] every
[29:31] morning and when it lay and when it lays
[29:34] down at night
[29:35] am you ought to know that the table is a
[29:40] Rigg you ought to know that whatever
[29:42] happens from the time you get up to the
[29:44] time you lay
[29:47] down it's all under the
[29:50] blood it's all under the blood the only
[29:53] person who remembers
[29:56] that is you and the devil
[29:59] amen amen God doesn't see it amen and
[30:03] something that that just came to my mind
[30:05] right
[30:06] now was was a har
[30:09] family um they got me a Bible for my
[30:11] birthday
[30:14] man God bless him for
[30:16] that and on
[30:18] it it has it has a it has a cross on
[30:22] it and on the cross it has a a paper
[30:25] that says record of debt amen
[30:34] amen and has my name on
[30:36] it amen and it it just seems so
[30:40] tremendous how um I I didn't even have
[30:44] to do
[30:46] anything it's all it's all already done
[30:49] amen amen all I have to do is live the
[30:53] life the blueprint has already been set
[30:55] for us
[30:58] all we have to do is live according to
[30:59] the way that the Lord's showing us
[31:03] amen amen but uh as The Story
[31:07] Goes uh Jesus is Led Out Into the
[31:11] Wilderness he's leted out
[31:14] alone amen and us talking with my dad a
[31:17] little
[31:19] bit uh we kind of we kind of talked
[31:22] about how uh how the attitude that you
[31:26] take towards the
[31:31] Wilderness it'll show your true colors
[31:35] amen amen and for me
[31:38] personally well I take it like this I
[31:41] say I say to myself I say well well it's
[31:45] really easy in church to to be in a
[31:48] Revival
[31:51] amen it's really easy it's really easy
[31:53] to be in a good mood
[31:56] too but what about when we leave
[31:59] amen what then it gets a lot harder then
[32:03] amen when it's just you
[32:06] alone but more often than
[32:10] not the attitude that you
[32:12] take towards the trials that you endure
[32:17] amen will determine the altitude
[32:20] amen and the
[32:23] altitude will determine whether or not
[32:26] you can just fly right over
[32:30] amen the trials won't affect
[32:33] you if you're attitude is
[32:35] [Music]
[32:37] Right amen amen amen one thing I
[32:41] like that uh a preacher named TD Jake
[32:46] said as he says
[32:49] this he says this about the desert the
[32:53] Wilderness and that's where Jesus was he
[32:55] says this
[32:58] it is a
[32:59] desert that separates the
[33:03] Saints from the
[33:05] ANS amen and I really like that because
[33:09] our
[33:10] trials although we may not like to
[33:12] endure
[33:14] them it does a lot for us it really does
[33:19] it shows us if our experience we had the
[33:21] past
[33:24] Sunday was really genuine amen
[33:27] not to say it
[33:29] wasn't but I would
[33:31] prefer to not shed a single
[33:35] tear to never feel so
[33:39] anything to never feel the presence of
[33:44] God but for God to truly change me on
[33:46] the
[33:49] inside for God to change my
[33:51] mind to change my attitude to change my
[33:55] habits
[33:58] anything I would prefer that over
[34:01] anything amen amen what else does your
[34:04] trials do for
[34:07] you it shows you how close you are to
[34:09] God
[34:12] Amen imagine 40 days and 40
[34:16] nights a lot could have happened to the
[34:20] Lord he could have walked away from the
[34:23] Lord from the father
[34:25] amen
[34:28] amen and and when we're not
[34:31] here when we're alone it shows us how
[34:34] truly how close we are to God
[34:37] Amen where we invest our
[34:40] time amen what attracts
[34:43] us behind closed doors
[34:47] amen amen and and the the last
[34:50] thing is that it brings you closer to
[34:54] him it brings you closer to God
[34:58] Amen if you allow it because even if you
[35:02] fail
[35:03] Brothers you come back where you failed
[35:06] and and you know what to do
[35:09] better you know what not to do
[35:13] amen amen amen I'm going to be closing
[35:17] now and I'm going to go ahead and read
[35:20] uh verse 33 of uh of John
[35:25] 16
[35:29] and it says like
[35:31] this it says these things I have spoken
[35:34] unto you that in me ye might have peace
[35:39] in the world ye shall have tribulation
[35:42] but be of good cheer I have overcome the
[35:52] world Amen aren't you
[35:55] happy that's the god that you
[35:57] serve knows what it's like
[36:01] amen I don't like it I don't like it
[36:05] when somebody tries to tell me
[36:07] something but they've never lived it
[36:10] amen I say well how would you
[36:14] know what would you
[36:16] know Brothers God
[36:19] knows God knows amen God bless
[36:25] you
[36:28] [Applause]
[36:33] God bless you
[36:35] Brothers if we can change uh turn our
[36:38] Bibles to Matthew chapter 4:3 and
[36:45] 4 and The Temper came to him and he said
[36:49] if thou be the Son of God command that
[36:53] those stones be made
[36:55] bread
[37:04] but he answered and he said it is
[37:06] written and man shall not live by bread
[37:09] alone but by every word that's proceeded
[37:12] out of the mouth of
[37:24] God when Jesus was in in the
[37:28] wilderness he was there for 40 days and
[37:30] 40
[37:32] nights he had just received the the Holy
[37:37] Spirit oh he and he probably was having
[37:39] the best time of his
[37:43] life I am
[37:45] alone no one's going to bother
[37:47] me I am having a good time up
[37:52] here but his first
[37:55] temptation
[37:57] oh one of one of the the first assaults
[37:58] how brother brandham says one of the
[38:01] first
[38:06] assaults happened when he came
[38:10] down and the and Satan told
[38:14] him turn these stones into
[38:19] bread he was hungry at that
[38:23] time and Satan hit him in his weakest
[38:25] point
[38:33] he could have performed that Miracle
[38:34] right
[38:38] there but he said it is
[38:43] written and
[38:50] I see he could have used his
[38:54] powers he could have used that and turn
[38:57] those stones into
[39:04] bread see and there was two more times
[39:07] after that when Satan tempted
[39:12] him the other time was when he was in
[39:15] the
[39:17] temple and then when he took him to the
[39:21] mountain and he showed him all the
[39:24] kingdoms and he said this cannot be
[39:33] yours but he said I will these he said
[39:37] Satan told
[39:38] him if you worship
[39:41] me this cannot be
[39:44] yours but Jesus told them
[39:48] again it is
[39:51] written and the only one that should be
[39:55] worshiped
[39:58] is the
[40:01] Lord see last night I I I was
[40:05] thinking and and I was thinking what if
[40:08] Jesus really turned those stones into
[40:16] bread see he would have ate
[40:19] them and he would have been
[40:23] full but see that he would have be
[40:25] hungry again in a few
[40:32] hours that would have just been an
[40:34] instant
[40:38] [Music]
[40:43] gratification see because he would have
[40:45] been hungry again in a few
[40:48] hours see sometimes we want to fill
[40:51] ourselves with instant
[40:55] gratifications
[40:59] we just want the easy
[41:02] routes see Satan comes and tempts
[41:06] us and he offers us
[41:09] something and that's what happens
[41:11] sometimes when we're
[41:13] alone like brother was
[41:17] saying you know he finds us
[41:20] alone he says I'm going to give you
[41:24] this I'm would you take
[41:30] sometimes he just wants to give us
[41:34] sex he wants to give us
[41:36] drugs he wants to give us
[41:38] money he wants to give us
[41:41] Fame he wants to give us
[41:44] L he wants to give us he wants to give
[41:47] us
[41:49] luxury he wants to give us
[41:52] pornography he wants to give us
[41:54] music he wants to give us
[41:56] Sports he wants to give you something
[41:59] that satisfies your
[42:02] flesh he wants to give us
[42:06] makeup he wants you to feel better for
[42:08] the
[42:11] moment he wants you to feel good at the
[42:16] moment see all those things are just
[42:18] like
[42:20] sugar see sugar only energizes just just
[42:24] for a little bit
[42:29] it gives you energy for a few
[42:33] minutes and it goes
[42:36] away that's how sin
[42:43] is see the things of the
[42:46] world they just fill us up
[42:53] temporarily it doesn't give us a full
[42:55] satisfaction
[42:58] it just fills you up for just a
[43:02] moment it just gives you a quick feeling
[43:04] in your
[43:09] flesh but let me tell you
[43:12] this come on youth don't let the devil
[43:15] fool
[43:21] you it's only going to make you feel
[43:24] good for a little bit
[43:29] see we're all tempted some way or some
[43:32] way
[43:36] or we all
[43:39] sin none of us here don't
[43:42] sin we sin every
[43:47] day I know there's someone here
[43:54] tonight that's Satan
[44:01] that we have to tell
[44:04] Satan you know what
[44:06] Satan I don't care how much you T
[44:11] me you're not going to overcome
[44:15] me I was made to be an
[44:20] overcomer I'm not going to let nothing
[44:23] beat
[44:25] me come on youth if there's someone that
[44:28] can
[44:30] say I'm not going to let you take
[44:33] me you're not going to beat
[44:37] me no sir if there is a youth that would
[44:40] say here
[44:43] tonight it is
[44:46] written that promise is
[44:49] mine it is written in the word of
[44:53] God and there is no one that's going to
[44:56] take it from
[44:57] me I don't care what the world
[45:01] says I don't care what the people
[45:04] say I don't care what my coworkers
[45:11] say or what my classmates
[45:17] say I'm not going to gain the
[45:22] World Mark 8:36 says
[45:32] maros what's the whole point the whole
[45:36] gaining the whole world if you're just
[45:37] going to lose your
[45:42] soul what's the point of gaining all
[45:47] that you can gain all
[45:49] that you can gain all the riches you
[45:53] want but we're just going to lose it all
[46:04] it doesn't matter how much the devil
[46:05] tempts
[46:10] you if there is someone
[46:13] here that would say it is
[46:16] written just like Jesus said at
[46:19] that he said no
[46:22] sir it is
[46:24] written
[46:29] is there someone that would say
[46:33] tonight I'm not going to let these
[46:35] worldly
[46:38] things get between
[46:41] me that will get between
[46:44] me and my relationship with
[46:53] God youth Hess it is time that you
[46:58] discover that the only thing you need
[47:00] here on
[47:03] Earth it is God nothing
[47:08] else are you willing to leave everything
[47:13] behind all those things that have
[47:15] tempted you in the
[47:17] past all those things that filled you up
[47:23] temporarily all those things that gave
[47:25] you an inst
[47:28] gratification it's not too late to turn
[47:30] your life
[47:36] around don't worry about the mistakes
[47:39] you
[47:41] done don't let it disturb your
[47:45] future leave it all in God's
[47:49] hands all these Earthly
[47:52] things they're all just a waste of time
[47:57] they not going to give you
[48:04] anything it is time to turn to him and
[48:07] you will find
[48:10] peace he will give you your full
[48:16] gratification he will fill you
[48:20] completely and nothing can take that
[48:22] from
[48:24] you
[48:31] see because the most beautiful things
[48:35] here on
[48:36] Earth they cannot be
[48:39] seen they cannot be
[48:42] touched you can't even smell
[48:45] them they come from your
[48:48] heart it is a seed that's in your
[48:53] heart it is something that's in your
[48:55] heart
[48:57] that is calling
[48:58] you something that was born in your
[49:02] heart something that was placed in your
[49:08] heart Isaiah 40:31 says and I'm not
[49:11] going to read the whole
[49:14] verse says wait upon the
[49:18] Lord he will renew your
[49:23] strength when you feel weak
[49:26] when you feel like you can't do it no
[49:29] more I know this life is
[49:32] hard I've been tempted so many
[49:35] times and a lot of times I have
[49:39] fallen but that doesn't help
[49:42] me I don't give
[49:44] up I get back up and I keep
[49:49] fighting come on you don't give up you
[49:52] got to keep fighting for your salvation
[49:56] you got to keep fighting for what God
[49:58] has given
[50:00] you if you can't overcome something
[50:02] right
[50:03] now just wait upon the
[50:06] Lord he will give you the strength that
[50:09] you
[50:11] need he will give you the energy you
[50:15] need he's not going to give you
[50:16] something
[50:18] temporary he's going to give you
[50:20] something that's full of
[50:24] Eternity
[50:29] I'm going to read this this this uh
[50:32] verse this uh
[50:34] quote from the message how can I
[50:39] overcome though Jesus was tempted he
[50:42] overcame he overcame for
[50:47] us he endured all things for me and for
[50:50] you
[50:54] see
[50:56] he could have took it right
[51:00] then but what he did to take the other
[51:03] route
[51:06] for so that we could be with
[51:11] him if he pay such a
[51:16] price how little would it be not to take
[51:23] it when we remember there is nothing
[51:26] here
[51:32] anyhow if you live 100
[51:35] years what are you going to come
[51:39] to mental your mind
[51:43] gone all crippled
[51:47] up all Shake all old and
[51:51] shaky that's where you're
[51:54] going
[51:56] that's the end of
[51:59] it you come now and overcome the
[52:04] thing how do you do it by the word that
[52:07] God
[52:11] says you do it walk
[52:16] humbly live before
[52:19] Jesus he endured all those things for
[52:22] you and
[52:24] I
[52:26] he is our example on how to overcome our
[52:29] evil
[52:35] generation he as he as he overcome his
[52:38] evil
[52:41] generation he gave us everything so we
[52:45] can
[52:47] overcome it may seem
[52:50] easy but it is
[52:52] hard I know it's hard
[52:58] is Matthew 2435
[53:02] says it says Heaven and Earth will
[53:07] pass but my words shall not pass
[53:14] away the word of God
[53:17] youth will not pass it will not
[53:22] perish he is giving you the greatest
[53:27] weapon to fight
[53:30] Temptation and that's the
[53:33] word don't let this be weak body beat
[53:44] you I know it's going to be
[53:47] hard but your soul is worth
[53:51] more what are you going to
[53:53] do are are you going to let this weak
[53:56] body beat
[53:58] you or you going to let the soul that
[54:01] wants to
[54:06] fight
[54:07] fight for your eternal
[54:11] life if there's someone that would say
[54:13] here
[54:15] tonight that would
[54:17] say I don't care what the devil
[54:21] says it is
[54:23] written and I am I'm going to stand for
[54:27] God God bless
[54:31] [Applause]
[54:41] you God bless you
[54:45] brothers so on Fridays
[54:48] now we're preaching on
[54:50] Jesus and the beginning of his
[54:54] ministry
[54:55] and today we're focusing on Matthew
[54:57] chapter
[55:00] 4 and this chapter is the chapter where
[55:02] Jesus went to the
[55:06] Wilderness and he fasted 40 days and 40
[55:10] nights and he was tempted by the
[55:13] devil now in one of the in one of The
[55:17] Temptations which was the third
[55:19] Temptation he
[55:21] had the devil took him up to a high
[55:24] mountain
[55:28] and he showed him all the
[55:30] nations and he said I can give you all
[55:33] this if if only you Bow Down and Worship
[55:38] me but Jesus
[55:41] said get thee hence
[55:45] Satan for it is
[55:47] written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy
[55:52] God and him only shall thou worship
[55:59] now
[56:00] Brothers the devil came to
[56:05] Jesus with the
[56:08] word and Jesus also came with the
[56:12] word but what was the
[56:15] difference the difference
[56:18] was that Jesus that de the devil came
[56:21] with the
[56:23] word but he came with the wrong
[56:27] intentions he came to tempt
[56:30] Jesus but Jesus he came with the
[56:34] word and the right
[56:37] attitude he came with the
[56:39] word and the right
[56:43] Spirit he came filled with the Holy
[56:48] Ghost and with the right spirit in the
[56:52] word he was able to defeat Jesus
[56:58] and
[57:00] Jesus he was our
[57:02] example that the word of
[57:05] God and the right
[57:07] Spirit can defeat the
[57:09] Devil any day
[57:13] anywhere at any
[57:15] time and that was the main
[57:18] difference it was the attitude of
[57:22] Jesus he came full of the
[57:26] spirit and he fasted 40 days and 40
[57:30] nights and now the number 40 is the
[57:33] number of
[57:35] Temptation and I believe at this time
[57:37] Jesus was
[57:40] hungry and this is the time the devil
[57:43] knew that he would be at his weakest
[57:49] point but Jesus was
[57:53] ready because he knew the
[57:56] scriptures and he was full of the Holy
[58:00] Spirit now I would like to read
[58:04] Hebrews chapter 2 verse
[58:09] 18 for in that he himself has suffered
[58:12] being tempted he is able to secort them
[58:15] that are
[58:21] tempted you see Jesus had to be tempted
[58:25] in order to know what we go
[58:29] through you know brother brandham
[58:32] says he had to be tempted in every
[58:34] single
[58:36] thing in order to
[58:39] overcome so he can show
[58:42] us how we can
[58:45] overcome because Jesus is our greatest
[58:49] example that we
[58:51] have without Jesus we would be
[58:55] lost we would be lost in our own
[59:00] Pleasures because we were constantly
[59:02] fall into sin and
[59:07] Temptation so he had to be tempted
[59:10] Brothers in every single way
[59:14] imaginable so he could understand
[59:17] Us in order to help
[59:21] us you know brother brandham says
[59:25] that when he was up there in the
[59:28] mountain that the way Jesus was able to
[59:33] overcome was with the word in the right
[59:37] spirit and many times
[59:40] Brothers we have the word it's at our
[59:45] disposal we study and we
[59:48] read but many times we don't have the
[59:51] right
[59:52] attitude we don't have the right spirit
[59:56] why we're not
[59:59] prepared sometimes when on
[1:00:03] Fridays instead of preparing to come to
[1:00:07] service we're at home laying back
[1:00:12] chilling watching a
[1:00:14] movie maybe watching some Instagram
[1:00:19] reals but that's not right
[1:00:22] Brothers especially if you're down
[1:00:26] because it's easy to overcome in the
[1:00:28] high
[1:00:31] places when you're but when you're down
[1:00:33] in the
[1:00:34] valley that's when the trial
[1:00:38] begins that's where the devil likes to
[1:00:40] come at
[1:00:42] us you know brother Bram says when one
[1:00:45] receives the Holy
[1:00:47] Ghost that's when the Devil comes to try
[1:00:49] and tempt
[1:00:52] us because he knows
[1:00:55] he can he he tries his best to convince
[1:00:59] us that we did not receive
[1:01:01] anything that's when he tempts
[1:01:04] us to try to make us
[1:01:07] fall to make us
[1:01:10] think that we did not receive the Holy
[1:01:14] Ghost but Brothers we have to
[1:01:17] prepare we have to prepare
[1:01:20] ourselves not just for
[1:01:22] service but for his coming
[1:01:26] because if we don't
[1:01:27] prepare we're going to stay behind
[1:01:30] brothers and that's what the devil's
[1:01:32] trying to
[1:01:33] do and that's why he tempts us so
[1:01:37] hard especially in this day and
[1:01:40] age you know in this day and
[1:01:43] age you know all these social media
[1:01:47] platforms they have they have launched a
[1:01:49] war against
[1:01:53] us for
[1:01:55] things for our
[1:01:58] attention and for our
[1:02:01] time because many
[1:02:03] times we waste the time of
[1:02:08] God we waste the time of God on other
[1:02:11] things instead of what we should be
[1:02:15] doing which is reading his
[1:02:18] word and preparing
[1:02:21] ourselves
[1:02:23] now many
[1:02:25] times we're in a fallen
[1:02:29] condition and like our brother Titus
[1:02:31] said on
[1:02:32] Wednesday we have little
[1:02:35] strength but like he said when we have
[1:02:39] little
[1:02:40] strength that's the best time to go back
[1:02:42] to his
[1:02:45] word that's when we should go to his
[1:02:48] word because that's where our strength
[1:02:52] is you know God had to show the Church
[1:02:55] of
[1:02:58] Philadelphia that by their
[1:03:00] works and by their
[1:03:02] strength they were
[1:03:04] nothing they could not do it they had to
[1:03:08] hold
[1:03:09] on to his word they had to hold
[1:03:13] on to his
[1:03:15] strength because that's the only way
[1:03:17] we're going to make it
[1:03:20] Brothers like brother Titus
[1:03:22] said sometimes we're too
[1:03:26] strong and because we're too
[1:03:29] strong we think we could do it on our
[1:03:33] own and that's why many of the
[1:03:36] times God lets us be
[1:03:39] tempted God lets us be beat
[1:03:44] down because he's seeking someone
[1:03:48] weak so that weak
[1:03:51] person can come to him and fully submit
[1:03:56] himself in order to
[1:03:59] say it was by your strength
[1:04:03] Lord not by
[1:04:05] mine and you
[1:04:07] know we can receive the Holy
[1:04:10] Ghost and God can be with
[1:04:13] us and God can dwell in
[1:04:16] us and he can help us with
[1:04:19] temptation but at the end of the day
[1:04:22] it's up to us
[1:04:25] whether or not to
[1:04:27] fall whether or not to fall into that
[1:04:30] Temptation it's up to us
[1:04:33] Brothers it's up to our
[1:04:37] decision we have to make a
[1:04:40] decision am I going to go to
[1:04:42] God am I going to hold on to his
[1:04:46] word or am I going to rely on something
[1:04:50] else am I going to r on
[1:04:53] Instagram St maybe I rely on my
[1:04:56] job maybe I I rely on something
[1:04:59] else on
[1:05:01] myself on making
[1:05:05] money all that
[1:05:07] brothers that that's all
[1:05:10] right but it shouldn't be our main
[1:05:12] source of
[1:05:15] strength it should be the word of
[1:05:19] God and
[1:05:21] brothers many times whether or not to
[1:05:25] take his word the devil's
[1:05:29] word or to take the word of
[1:05:33] God you know we need to be filled so
[1:05:39] much with the word of
[1:05:42] God and with the right
[1:05:45] spirit that we overcome the Temptation
[1:05:48] the devil throws at
[1:05:53] us because before Jesus went into the
[1:05:55] Wilderness to be
[1:05:59] tempted he was
[1:06:01] baptized and it says he was filled with
[1:06:03] the Holy
[1:06:06] Spirit and we should be the same
[1:06:10] way we need to be filled
[1:06:13] brothers or else we're not going to make
[1:06:16] it we need to be so
[1:06:20] filled that we're just like
[1:06:23] Jesus
[1:06:25] who said
[1:06:26] devil get away from me for it is
[1:06:31] written it is
[1:06:33] written and
[1:06:35] brothers he is
[1:06:38] he he is our example
[1:06:41] brothers and it is
[1:06:44] written it's written brothers that we're
[1:06:47] going to make
[1:06:48] it you know sometimes we're at
[1:06:53] lows and we have little
[1:06:55] strength and many times we
[1:06:59] fall but it's
[1:07:01] okay just get back
[1:07:04] again don't give
[1:07:06] up learn from your
[1:07:08] mistakes don't stay
[1:07:10] down for it says in Proverbs
[1:07:15] 24:16 for the just man falls seven
[1:07:18] times but he gets up
[1:07:21] again and I believe
[1:07:24] that if you're a
[1:07:25] Christian if you fall seven
[1:07:28] times the Lord will lift you up
[1:07:32] eight for it's not about our
[1:07:35] strength but it's by
[1:07:38] his that's why we need the right
[1:07:42] Spirit to submit ourselves
[1:07:46] fully to God to God and His
[1:07:50] word because it's like my brother Edward
[1:07:52] said one time
[1:07:56] we can come to
[1:07:57] church in his
[1:07:59] name but not in the right
[1:08:03] spirit and brothers that's the
[1:08:07] truth because if we don't have the right
[1:08:10] Spirit we're just like the
[1:08:14] Pharisees you know the the musicians
[1:08:16] come
[1:08:18] forward and I would just like to read
[1:08:20] this quote by brother
[1:08:22] brandham
[1:08:25] in Bal and
[1:08:27] Gilead preached in
[1:08:31] 59 now with our heads
[1:08:35] bowed I would like to ask this Solon
[1:08:39] question how many people present would
[1:08:41] like to come to that
[1:08:46] Fountain would want God to put his
[1:08:48] spirit so richly in
[1:08:52] you like was in
[1:08:55] Jesus so that you could resist
[1:09:00] temptation that you've tasted something
[1:09:02] so much better than
[1:09:05] tobacco something so much better
[1:09:08] Pleasures than drinking will
[1:09:11] give so much better pleasures of going
[1:09:14] to church than it would be to go to a
[1:09:16] card
[1:09:20] party you'd like to have that you'd love
[1:09:24] to have
[1:09:25] it so you could be free from
[1:09:29] sin not because you are not
[1:09:32] tempted but in every
[1:09:35] Temptation he will make a way of
[1:09:38] Escape you
[1:09:40] know God is so
[1:09:42] faithful he'll always make a way of
[1:09:46] escape the Bible says that he will not
[1:09:49] allow us to be
[1:09:52] tempted more than we can
[1:09:56] bear and that he can he will always have
[1:09:58] a way of
[1:10:01] escape and what is his way of
[1:10:04] Escape holding on to his
[1:10:07] word holding on to the Holy
[1:10:09] Spirit letting him take
[1:10:12] control being so
[1:10:15] filled of the word of God in his
[1:10:18] Spirit to say
[1:10:21] devil it is written

[1:10:34] tonight be able to
[1:10:37] say devil get off of me stay away from

[1:10:59] much that I am fully in his
[1:11:04] will I am fully in his
[1:11:08] will and I am doing what he is asking me
[1:11:11] to
[1:11:13] do and I'm not falling to
[1:11:17] Temptation because I am so full of
[1:11:20] him because he overcame
[1:11:24] and because it's not
[1:11:26] me for it's Christ in
[1:11:29] me who is now overcoming that

[1:32:03] God God is good with
[1:32:07] us gives us words of
[1:32:10] life gives us what we need to
[1:32:13] hear sometimes it's not what we want to
[1:32:16] hear but it's what we need to
[1:32:20] hear God knows how to speak to our
[1:32:22] hearts
[1:32:24] amen God bless our
[1:32:26] brothers God continue using them these
[1:32:31] youth may God be with
[1:32:35] them I was
[1:32:40] meditating I have never meditated this
[1:32:42] on this
[1:32:46] before sometimes we think it was 40 days
[1:32:48] and 40 nights of
[1:32:50] Temptation Felix like our brother Felix
[1:32:56] said he may have been okay for 40 days
[1:32:59] and 40
[1:33:01] nights he had just come from a
[1:33:05] Revival that's how we find ourselves
[1:33:07] many times when God
[1:33:09] descends he anoints
[1:33:11] us and we feel his
[1:33:15] presence and for a time we're
[1:33:20] okay days for 40 days and 40 nights all
[1:33:24] right he wasn't
[1:33:26] tempted until after the 40 days and 40
[1:33:32] nights sometimes we're still Sur we're
[1:33:34] still surviving from the
[1:33:38] anointing we're still maintaining from
[1:33:40] that great Revival that we
[1:33:45] had but it when it begins to fade
[1:33:50] out
[1:33:52] sooner or later there will be there will
[1:33:53] be a
[1:33:55] decline there will be a come a time of
[1:34:00] Temptation it was until after those 40
[1:34:02] days and 40 when the Temptation
[1:34:07] came when Satan
[1:34:10] came the devil knows how to
[1:34:14] wait wait for that emotion to go
[1:34:17] [Music]
[1:34:19] by wait for that Revival to go to just
[1:34:22] calm
[1:34:23] down and then come to tempt
[1:34:27] us in our most weakest of
[1:34:32] times and how beautiful God spoke to
[1:34:36] us we need the right
[1:34:39] Spirit not only the
[1:34:42] word but we need the right
[1:34:44] Spirit we
[1:34:47] forget before Jesus could
[1:34:50] overcome he had to be filled with the
[1:34:53] spirit that's what we

[1:34:58] spirit may God help us in seeking
