glad to be in the house of the Lord I'm always glad to be in the house of the Lord the house of the Lord there Liberty the house of the Lord there is peace amen amen can we please turn our Bibles to Romans 8 9 to1 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but a spirit is life because of righteousness 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you yes he that raised up Christ from dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that amen amen the title sermon today our lord Jesus died and resurrected on the third day meaning he was Victorious over death death could never hold him captive even in the grave he was still the Lord even in the grave he was still the Lord one brother preached that uh Jesus Christ was went to preach when he was buried he went to preach to the lost souls and all those who believed him resurrected with him and got salvation and if you believe in Jesus Christ we shall also overcome death the S of death is broken and we are victorious as Paul declared uh death is something we all don't want nobody want to hear about death uh brother Braham has to look on on for their wife and the daughter to die very painful even Jesus Christ himself that he didn't want that tribulation to come over him when he was going to die even though he had the assurance that he was going to be resurrected we all scared of death right but we Believers just because our Lord Jesus Christ died and resurrected we are also going to be resurrected we see uh politicians and very rich people around right they move around with lot of security men with the police with the Secret Service with the FBI and all why they are scared of death they are scared of death they are scared of that but we Believers are victorious what do we do to keep our body so that we don't uh die early or be healthy all the time so we try to do more exercise right try to eat healthy more vegetables more fruit stay very very strong so do we think about our spiritual body as well you could be physically alive do we know that you can be walking around but you are spiritually dead so uh I've not attended a lot of funerals here though but back in Ghana when there's a funeral the pastor try to ask you guys in there to reflect ask you guys to not to weep for the person lying there but rather to weep for yourself but if you were the one lying there were you prepared are we prepared now and you know what happened at the moment when you're at the funeral and the pastor is talking about that everybody gets really sad like I'm very holy I'm only going to live right life I'm going to pray going to read the Bible every day oh my God after two days you forgot me because we only act when things happen right there the physical body so we don't need to think so much about our physical body we need to think more about our spiritual body we are spiritually we are physically alive but we could be spiritually dead the Bible says without Jesus Christ we are dead in our sins if we don't believe in him we are spiritually dead I movie I watched before The Walking Dead so the movie Walking the title of Walking Dead it's an old movie you could see dead people walking very funny and they tend to harm people who are alive I'm like that's not possible you are dead I'm alive how can it hurt me that's just we don't want to be a walking dead so we need to keep our spiritual life intact if we don't have the Holy Ghost we are dead but when Christ enters us he breathe life into us we are resurrected with him we always have to seek him first or else we're going to be walking dead the Bible also says in John 11:25 Jesus said I'm am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though you were dead shall live whoever liveth in me shall never die whoever liveth in me shall never die if you have Christ you have everlasting life and you have victory over death because the sting of death is broken our Lord Jesus Christ buried and he resurrected anything that we are buried in if it's against the will of God we also going to rise you don't only need to think about the physical death but most of the time theual one too what are we buried in today are we buried in sin and saham said is just an attribute of unbelief so I say are you buried in unbelief what is distracting us from closer to God Jesus Christ was buried and he rose up Victorious anything that we are buried in we are going to rise up as well the thing of death can never whatever we are buried in whatever that distract us from getting closer to God we can rise above it through Christ so we we go through the baptism right we always see the baptism over here so we are buried we resurrect so when we resurrect come in a new body filled with the Holy Ghost walk with Christ and for that we are victorious everybody in church here today must be resurrected if there's any spiritual death want to be resurrected if you are buried in anything if you are buried in anything that we scared of away from God rise up and resurrect amen amen I want to read a quote from Brother bram's book written in 1954 title is God's provided way of dealing with sin said I was standing out today watching some honey bees work and I watched those honey bees I thought well well when a honey bee ever stings a person then the Stinger is left in the person it cannot sting no more the honey be stinging is done any insect that stins you one time that finishes it because he leaves the Stinger there and I tell you Jesus Christ on Calvary pull a stinger out of death the out of death there there we sickness has no control anymore God done suffer it in judgment Jesus Took the stinger out of sin Jesus Took the stinger out of sickness Jesus Took the singer sorry the Stinger of San Jesus Took the stinger out of sin and tonight he's helpless devil there's no Sting the sting is broken our Lord Jesus Christ has broken that thing hallelujah hallelujah he can only buz and make lot of f but he's got no stinger the devil can only scare us but he cannot harm us his things are broken Paul said oh death where is your s grave where is your Victory thanks be to God he gives us the victory our Lord Jesus Christ whatever that is keeping us buried in this life is it unbelief is it pain is it fear let's remember that Jesus rose and whatever your situation is it will rise to whatever your situation you will rise too we have victory over every form of death because our Lord Jesus Christ was Victorious and if you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ over death we have victory of over every form of death physical spiritual in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we will rise like our lordus Christ amen amen God bless you good evening Brothers how tremendous right we believe in a living God we believe in a God that isn't dead why do I say that brothers because I see everyone that is here seated tonight I could have been somewhere else brother but to God it pleased him be here tonight I'm not the only one because we serve a living God who is living in power in the power of Resurrection let me tell you brother that that power that power you you you you have it have that power if Jesus Christ died over 2000 years ago resurrected resurrected because he said my Sono is going to be here going to die for him woo listen to it Brothers the Lord Jesus Christ he left the throne he did he shouldn't have he didn't need to leave the throne but to him pleased him it didn't please me I didn't tell him Jesus Christ come down come down from your glory you can die for me no brother he himself predestined us before foundation of the world so let me tell you tonight same power power of resurrection and it's in our hands because if our heavenly father did it already who are we brothers are we not Sons and Daughters of God amen amen what does the son do the son he always he tries to be like his father and that's what we're trying to do we ourselves have that power of Resurrection let me tell you Brothers it's not just that power that we have it is the power the power what a tremendous title our brother rapael is the power of Resurrection think about it church he spoke of death tell you let me ask you I have a question how many are prepared to die have you thought about that brother I've thought about it why Brothers I truly know who I am and you have to know young man young lady you yourselves have to know who you truly are not just any person let me tell you you just any person why because we serve a living God that is our father just as it pleased him to come down from Glory I'm going to come down from Glory he said I'm going to die for my brother Tavo there you can place your name I don't want to get into problem because I don't know everyone's name put your name there that the Lord Jesus chist he left his that he was so calm maybe he was sitting down but that came to him within himself I will go and die to die but it didn't just stay there because he has the power he has the power in his hands the power of healing death the power over anything are you depress he has the power only thing you have to do Tell Him Father I have this I know that you already died on that you didn't just die the third day and you Rose to overcome the because let me tell you he is a blood wants to have you in the in those chains wants to have you bound he wants to have you he wants to hold you in that in that mad house PA house in that pawn house You'll Go free tonight and why brothers because of the power because of the power of Resurrection there's nothing impossible what you ask of him tonight he'll do it for you that power is in your hands anything brother nothing impossible for remember brother that he came down from his glory and he came to this earth and he was crucified think about it think about crucified he was beaten he was smashed he bled but he's not dead he lives as he came down from his glory quickening power power of the spoken word he did it for a purpose that purpose go to the dep of the deep went to the deepest of this Earth he went to hell when he got to hell he didn't think of why he is theth he of Resurrection oh Brothers Satan he was laughing he was saying I have him he was dead he was crucified at all the blood that came out laughing of of An Almighty God wasn't just any person when he was here on the earth he was a man but let me tell you he made himself a man he made himself a because wanted to feel what you feel he wanted to go what you go through he wanted to go through or have sicknesses why brother a god with power because he knew that he had to make himself human he had it all brother that is the Almighty the god of power that we have in this day he is not dead and what did he do Brothers he went to the deepest point of of the depths of of the deep to hell and he knocked on the door he didn't have to knock on the door it's God it's Jesus Christ he didn't have to do that and even then he still did it and when they cracked the window and they seen it was him they laughed this one's ours now I imagine brothers that they were kind of savoring that taste because those demons the devil thought that they had him in their hands oh Brothers but they didn't know that he's a God is the Lord Jesus Christ who was incarn but when he got there he was any man he was someone special because he had a plan that he went to that place to take the keys of the gates of death to the keys of death so that's why I ask this question to you are you ready to die what a question as our brother rapael said it scares you right let me tell you brother that we ourselves are someone someone special we ourselves shouldn't be afraid of death young man young lady if you truly know who you are don't fear death why because you've served youve accepted a living God who has power of resurrection and he still has it and that is the devil because the Devil Couldn't with God and so he goes against his children I tell my wife my love you know why the devil goes against our children because he can't with you and die think about it Church when Satan could no longer with God and who does he go against he goes against us he makes us suffer but let me tell you tonight stop suffering you have the power you have the power in your hands it is yours tonight stop suffer and you talk with the devil devil yes devil don't because you are a son and daughter of the Lord Jesus Christ so because you have that because your father not just any father but a true father that has the power of death he has the power of sicknesses illness he has the power of cancer he has the power of depression he has the power whatever you want whatever you need that power is in your hands young man young lady from here on now apply the word because the spoken word you have it in your hands and not only that brothers that great man there was a dead man and he'd been four days dead many of us know that story and he was there what were they doing at lazarus's grave what was he doing they're sitting and what did lazarus's sister say Lord Jesus Christ you should have came sooner you're late glory to God brother God is never late though he was four days dead but that is the power Resurrection in this day maybe we find ourselves dead dead in the spirit the power quickening the power the Holy Spirit more power this it's ours it's yours it's yours what keeps you from it what hinders you nothing in four days he'd been dead he died Lazarus and what was Martha saying oh Lord he's dead already why do you come what came from her lips or what came from his lips I want you to focus what happened what he said what came from his mouth Lazarus come forth come forth Lazarus come forth that power that power is still here in this day there's no time to be sick there's no time to be in sadness there's no time to be in depression there's no time that I have cancer there's no time and play Church he's coming he's coming and he's he's more near than what we think the power the power of Resurrection is here God bless you Brothers God bless you Brothers hear me I'm really nervous tonight brothers and the reason is I'm pretty sure brother Raa stole my notes but it's okay because I'm G steal his title I'm just playing if we can please open our scriptures real quick to Luke 24 verse 21 and it says like this but he trusted that it had been and he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done these were the ones who were walking to emus now if you can jump to verse 25 then he said unto them oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all in all the scriptures the things conc in himself I would like to thank my pastor for the trust he placed in me to be here tonight and I also like to thank God for allowing me to be here tonight now Jesus here is telling the people from going to emus that Christ had to die and Rise Again to fulfill the scriptures you know tonight the theme that I would like to bring is overcoming spiritual death now many times we're on our walk with God and in this walk we make mistakes you know many times we fall but you know one of the greatest mistakes we make as we decide to stay down there and we let the sin pile up and it slowly takes over us and we begin to die spiritually you know it's little by little maybe sometimes we stop reading our Bible a little bit we stop praying as much as we did you know something else takes over us but youth it's time that we wake up we don't have time to be down in sin to be spiritually dead we were not called for that you know many times as youth we say we're the future of the church but I say to you we're the present it's time we act like it you know many times we come to church and we seem dead we're just sitting there on the pews we can't even lift our hands we can't even say Amen we got to wake up why because the Lord Jesus Christ died for us to give us a chance the opportunity to go back home we need to realize the state of spiritual death we're in you know when the penalty of sin is death but we have the medicine and it's called Jesus because he said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this do you believe that church do you believe that youth I'd like to read a scripture from Brother Bam from the resurrection of Jesus preaching 56 Jesus said oh are you so slow at heart and watch when Jesus appears he goes straight to the scripture he said don't you know the scriptures must be fulfilled hallelujah hallelujah brother I feel awfully good right now don't you know the scripture has to get fulfilled and when people say they oh it's mental telepathy oh it's nothing to it it's just a bunch of Holy Rollers don't you know the scriptures must be fulfilled God has to appear in the last days and do the things he's doing now it's time to fulfill the scriptures he said and they shall come to pass in the last days I will pour out my spirit there it is Brothers he told us he would give us the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the Cure that is our medicine to overcome death overcome sin we just have to recognize the state of sin we are in the state of spiritual death we are in and get back up and keep on fighting not give any more land to the devil because if you give the devil an inch he's gonna take a mile you can't give him anything cuz he is going to take advantage of we need to let Jesus into our hearts in order to have our own Resurrection from our condition of spiritual death we all know the Story of Lazarus how Jesus Jus came four days after he died and Lazarus sister said Lord if you had been here earlier soon my brother would not have died but Brothers he's with us all the time we have the gift of the Holy Ghost but many times we refuse to recognize the state in which we are in we refuse to let the Lord help us come out of the position we are in but tonight youth let us have our own Resurrection from our condition of sin let us come out of the muck out of that filth just like Jesus said Lazarus come out come out place your name there David David come out of there you can't stay there you have to get up you can't stay down for my word says you are more than an overcomer we may fall seven times but the Lord lifts us up eight times we must overcome tonight youth I don't know what you're going through these past few weeks have been very hard on me but diving into God's word I recognize that I need my own Resurrection I need my own experience with God experience after experience over and over again daily daily we have to Die daily it's a daily decision I want to read this this quote from Brother Bram spiritual Amnesia preaching 64 I most surely was with him at Calvary look what he says here I must be identified with him at Calvary I must be there to a place that were not also was I identified with him in Calvary I died with him at Calvary every Christian must die with him at Calvary if you don't die with him at Calvary you can't be none of his I was there when he died I died with him oh and then I was with him when he raised up from the dead I come up on Easter morning with him in the resurrection whatever he did I was right there with him every believer was the same and now I am seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus with all the powers of Hell conquered through him every Christian believer will SE it the same way because you have to be identified we have to identify ourselves in Christ in his death but also in his resur res we must resurrect not just in a bodily form but spiritually why I don't know about you but I want to make it home I want to go back home I want to go see my father I want to go see my redeemer we must overcome our spiritual death and we do that by Christ you know brother BR says and how can I overcome preach in 63 you look back and say I'm doing this and I'm doing that then oh you're defeated but look here but there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit then you realize that you've overcome that's when we overcome when we recognize who our God is going down to 70 overcome the god that's in you is greater than that that's in him the god of the world is not as great as the god of Heaven which is in you because my God resurrected and he has power over death he has power over the keys of hell he has power over everything but let me ask you does he have power over your life does he we have to ask ourselves these questions brothers and you know it's time for us to fulfill the scriptures as well for God said we are more than Overcomers we are more than Overcomers Brothers I want to be up there in heaven with the redeemed with my redeemer but Brothers It's a daily decision what will you decide tonight youth don't stay down get back up you can do it Jesus Christ did it our Prophet did it why can't we we chose to be here God sent us here because he believes we could make it he believed in us he called us Overcomers he said we're more than Overcomers but it's up to you it's up to you tonight will you come out of the Grave will you will you rise up because like I said we're the present of the church we got to start acting like it amen if the music can come forward you know I know it's hard trying to find time to pray read your Bible go to work study go to school and all the other stuff you have to do I know it's hard youth but one day you'll you'll look at your life and you'll say it was worth it to live for the Lord because it's worth it Brothers nothing else will give you Joy in this life nothing else not drugs not women to the young ladies the men nothing we just have momentary Pleasures in this [Music] life for the joy that God gives me is eternal how many of you want that tonight you can have it it's at your reach you just have to be willing to humble yourself and say Lord I am here do with me what you want take me out of the Grave give me the strength to walk day by day in your walking alongside with you we have we have a decision to make tonight
