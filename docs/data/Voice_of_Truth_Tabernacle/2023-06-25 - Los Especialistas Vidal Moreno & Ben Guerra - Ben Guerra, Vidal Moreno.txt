get tired of speaking about him we send greetings to our brothers may God bless them if you may open your Bible with me it's my turn to preach with our brother Ben amen it's a privilege let's open our Bibles to Ephesians chapter 4. uh verse 11 to 13 then versicolo it reads like this and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers evangelistas for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ so we all come in the unity of the faith another knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man into the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is for the honor and privilege foreign would leave Lord satisfied satisfied because we heard your voice Lord when we give you honor and Glory yes in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen uh for a title uh brother Ben and I remember we uh we titled this we're a member of speech we're speaking on God's team and uh you know for title we were kind of in the same thought estamos he said something that I had already thought so we just went with uh for a title import The Specialist because I believe uh God does things in a special way and because we have a special God he has special people amen amen uh you know uh I I I uh I'm one of those people that I uh I enjoy uh you know I I want to talk about you know about our trip on Friday a little bit you know we went uh white water rafting you know what here at the poodle River yeah and then nobody ever done it before and uh I always always wanted to do it you know and uh it's just something about the waters you know I think every son or daughter of God there's something about those Waters you know that that just that just uh that just attracts the child to God maybe not physically but but spiritually that's that that's why we're here foreign [Music] it's gonna be my fault so I tried to stay calm and collected don't say this man okay um and uh and you know the the guys when they asked you know if that's the waters we're gonna go into when they asked him if those were the waters we're going to go into one more time when they asked if when we asked him if those were the waters we were going to go into Salos yes they said yes and uh they're like has anybody ever been white water rafting and uh and we all said no so they weren't worried so when I saw that they weren't worried I I wasn't worried either you know and I just kind of bring that you know to God's word see God called you and you know and if he's not worried you shouldn't be worried either you shouldn't be worried about what's coming your way we don't preach last year we preach God's truth yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be a rocky sometimes yeah there's going to be the waters are going to be you know are going to be hard sometimes the waves are going to come up and you know yeah we might get you know a little startled but don't worry because you were called for this we were all called for this if you weren't called by God I don't believe you would be here and it wasn't just any calls but it was a Divine call you see and when and you know we read you know about the fivefold ministry here you know I was reading you know and and it says in Ephesians 4. it says and he gave okay you know so when you give something you know it's it's a gift it's something that God he still called you to be here you see because the ministry that that was that this fightful ministry how do you know given by God is actually going to help build and see it's going to help build the church everybody that's here their faith needs to get built up it's going to be built up see God doesn't bring you here and he doesn't he doesn't he's not gonna tear you down you see when the man is preaching not only when the man is preached is it it's in the message the guide he says this he says the God isn't going to take you isn't going to take one over this way and one over that way he's going to keep you together and if we'll just let the Holy Ghost keep us together if we just don't let the devil pull you off on the wrong road says the Holy Spirit the guide of God that will guide us to all the truth that's right that's yes it says but you got to follow your guide you see we gotta follow our guys amen amen you see we're living in a very special time you see and the thing of it is for a very special time although it is a dark time I believe it's a special time you see and whenever you know we when whenever God calls us into this time I believe he has to have a Specialists you see a special operations special ops you guys know that play Call of Duty you know what I'm talking about you guys know the play Call of Duty you guys know what I'm talking about you see so you know a special time requires a special people and not to take away what's already been done [Music] with everything one of you say this oh because I believe that God didn't call us yes not to back out from this but to take a step back you know but I kind of get a rush but you know that that goes forwarding me when I see something that I enjoy we're not doing something in our life see when I'm building people something inside of me man just gets me going are you going through them because I could see I know there's more inside of you no do I know no but God knows see that's why he called you you see when we get all stirred up and scared I know you're sad and God knows that there's something else there okay you see this man right here this ain't the best you see everybody named in here is needed you see in order to take us to where we need to go we know we know we know that we know it's Apostles prophets pastors and evangelists you see it and if that's not revealed to you you ain't going nowhere because it's for the it's for the perfecting but the perfecting of the church if that hasn't been revealed to you then you're not gonna go where you think you're going because this is God's word it's not mine that's what God says and he said it through his Apostles amen amen we're just we're just helping out we're just doing our jobs amen amen Amen brother Burnham says this is talking about a guide again he says now what God knows where he's at says regardless of the weather you see he's equipped to do that he knows what he's doing he's familiar with everything he knows the looks of everything so he could just be in the darkness and he could feel any certain things you know when you have that kind of guys because I think that people can can see when somebody scared and when they're not sure when they're not sure what's happening I believe people can sense and you know when we were getting on that raft I was watching the guide and you know it was there was not a doubt in my mind you know that he was a man of God you know and that he and that God was with them you know God's with his people provide his leadership he's going to provide the help but you have to be willing to accept him to accept him even with his faults I still believe God that doesn't mean anything we're all going to make mistakes you see when you recognize that we're all human beings and we all make mistakes we all get scared every once in a while you know then you're on your way you know instead of criticizing oh we should help you shouldn't do something at times you know the reason that you're criticizing it's because you ain't doing anything is it because if you did something you wouldn't have time to criticize you wouldn't have time to criticize the sisters you know you're going to get criticized either way you know if you work out you get criticized because you work out and if you didn't work out you would still get criticized so if I'm gonna get criticized I want to be found doing something for the Lord that's it yes that's what I want to do I want to be create a phone to be criticized I want to be criticized for doing something for the for the Lord foreign [Music] as as we were when we got into the rafta our guide was the one that was steering from the back he was the one that was steering it was just if he told me if he said if he said forward too then you would row two times oh there was a moment in our raft I know what was going on in somebody else's but there was one moment in our raft he saw that that you know the people were startled and he starts and you know some people were just locked up they didn't do anything the thing of it was Nosotros the people El Pueblo the the people that that you know that have positions here in the church we're just doing what God told us to do you know but uh although you may not preach that doesn't mean you're not a part of God's team but that doesn't mean you may not have you know the job of somebody else but that doesn't mean that you're not a part of the elite that's right that's yes you know the elite or the Specialists they're all they're all one we're all one you were apart of a very special team by the Holy Ghost you know and although the times sometimes you don't feel like Rowan sometimes old man you might just have the world will grow just one time that could make the whole difference it could make the difference in the life of somebody if if you just if God calls you to do just one thing you see just just do it they do it with all your hearts does he do it with the best that you can I don't do it so that somebody can see you again but do it because it's in your heart to do it because God put it there you see because in the end that one thing that's one thing that you did they make the whole difference in the world to that one person you see you don't know you don't know who you're helping sometimes you see there's one guy in the Bible and it's Andrew yes Andres you know Andrew they don't talk a whole lot about him [Applause] foreign thank you brother Vidal for beautiful words for the Titans for a beautiful message this morning amen thank you for the confidence that you would have in us to speak behind your sacred desks how are you this morning it's low cold in here so what's the problem are we not moving around enough matter are we not giving God the glory amen I I know Friday was it was hot in here amen and I know God's Spirits here and I know he has control do you love him you think it's by some coincidence that you're here this morning why did you come this morning asking God for say that again asking the Lord for okay or did you come for no reason proposito did you come because they made you come over again did you come under some obligation you know we come in expectations that's our part then God has to do his part and you say what if I was made to come to church you know many times the parents are doing what they're told to do muchas what the word says and many times many of us came to church that way but it just took that one service that I did not want to be in service that's something you conquer the end the scripture says will he find faith when he returns so this group here this morning is he going to find faith now you could say you have faith now let's test it this morning yes is there anything too big for guys you know many times we come and we ask the people are you sick well you know the reality if you weren't sick is thinking well maybe I am but you know if God heals you today you're probably gonna get sick again but let's look a little bit further if God finds your soul today see dioses you're never going to be sick again spiritually it's something that changes he's not an Indian giver he's not going to take it back but the brothers were talking about something they said when we come to second service on Sunday they said there's not room for the people they said some of us has to wait back there so what's the problem what's the problem of a little dispute going on where's the face where's the Fate this morning there's nothing impossible if you need a church say that again if you need a church you've got to speak the word of God because there's no more people that could fit in this place now the problem that I see we can't find any more souls wow right brother yes Manos we say pray about it but that's not what God Said what did he say come on help me out here what'd he say says speak the words many people are afraid to speak the words because you know why they're afraid because they're afraid it's not going to come back [Music] and then they say wow you know people are going to look at us like if we're not Believers because it didn't come to pass you know what Abraham waited 25 years that's all that people see is they say 25 years I can't wait that long it is oh 25 years we have plenty of time for it to come to pass oh it is but there was something great it's not the greater that took place but you see something happen you see one day Abraham he was sitting in bed but then he wakes up and he sees his wife and he has to look again know what's going on here he saw a young lady that was laying right next to him it's just that calling God on the scene you believe every word that comes out of God's word you believe every word why are we afraid why are we afraid whatever you need this morning Don't Be Afraid don't be afraid you know we we we don't need a lot of time this morning words it's what God has in store for you there's a lot of things that have taken place and I'm tired of waiting I'm tired of making excuses but I want gosh you'll be manifest before church into existence we had an agenda here but God canceled we were going to talk about the book of Ezra but let's talk about it another time and they said let's build let's build a temple here a temple that they will never forget that if their children and their children's children forget who God was let them remember this day let them remember that's your God your church God called into existence remember this day and the scripture says we're not talking about a sacrifice we're not talking about a temple but that they may remember where they came from they wouldn't forget there's a lineage here okay but what things happened what things were so great foreign he trembles will not forget a this team has more than this than this church there's a fightful ministry that's been worldwide they laid the foundation of evangelists teachers for our strength so you say what's happened brothers and his name was William Branham and he laid the foundation for us there was a time that his existence gets through existence was in dangerous yes brother what are you doing say that again yes brother what are you doing we're raising your faith this morning because I can't ask you to have faith now we put it in God's hands God this morning he's going to raise your faith because water the prophet of God says what is the hardest thing to do come on I okay I can't hear you brother another child hey you gotta say it like you mean it come on brother you got it no no no I don't believe that you got to get me to believe it don't look around don't look around I want you to believe it this morning I want you to stand like you believe it come on brother foreign it's impossible for one man to believe another did you all hear that this morning now we're starting to believe for one man to believe another man I believe that man I don't believe he believes this man now let's call God we want to think it's an emotion so don't get confused while we're doing this morning there's a difference between faith [Music] so there was a time that the prophet's existence you see this nation was built upon the promise of God foreign and when they lay that foundation with with the Israelites and they said every generation we don't want to forget what's happened at this place now now let's let's bring it to our nation I know as a nation God closed the door for us and as individuals we still have a chance but you know the prophet was not here yet but his existence was in Jeopardy why do you say that brother because the prophet of God talks about George Washington George Washington he said he was at Valley Forge this is Jesus let me seek the Lord in prayer foreign Josue and he said wait a minute God promised Joshua the only problem that now one man would be lost he said if that same God Did It for Joshua he says he said he could do it for me and in his hand yes they went on a promised land they came back with the fruits then he could do the same for my mind and that's why this nation stands today yes that's a very touching story but without that happening we will never receive the prophets wow amen that he could turn his phone off after five o'clock but when you're having your parties for this congregation for the abomination of the people say that again for the Abominations of the people he's the one that cries so many times it may seem easy but they're the ones crying stay life in this place so they went back and they found the clothes of George Washington George Washington and they had bully holes [Music] no but it's you mamas serado beautiful I want to say a prayer for this church Iglesia it's not know some coincidence that we're here you know there was one of our elders at the church had had made a comment to me he said why do you like keep on going back to Colorado and you know sometimes you find the love for the people you don't know why but you know the love Is Just I love this place I love this church I have a really close buddy here Vidal you know why I like to fellowship with the brothers because I feel like when I'm with him I feel like we're Joshua and Caleb since why do we talk about brother we just talk about God's words you know that's the joy we have you can ask our wives they're out doing they may be shopping or whatever and we're sitting on the side of the street just talking about God's word we talk about the dumbest things but then we figure out how God's word has to do with it that's why I love this place foreign I don't know but the brother has a pure love inside of him so there's something that pulls me to this place people don't got to understand it God draws me here is we didn't even touch on anything because there was a deep calling to the deal I believe with all my heart he's going to give you your church and I don't believe you're going to have to wait 25 years but you got to believe it let's go to the Lord this morning remember it's not an emotions her gracious heavily followed Lord you know my heart this morning larger I believe your presence is here there's nothing that I can do with myself Lord right now [Music] and Lord these children they love you lord they're trying to find the last one lord lord your word tells us here probably preached the message Don't Cry No clams why cry but Speak Lord and in the name of Jesus we call this church into existence open the path that this may happen against everything everything with an emotion this is if anyone needs anything this morning [Music] I want you to claim it in the name of Jesus whatever it is you may say Lord but I want to dedicate every bit of my soul every action is Lord just help us be better brothers and sisters
