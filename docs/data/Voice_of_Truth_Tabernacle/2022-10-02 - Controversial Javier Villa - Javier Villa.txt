I'm a back Christian Brothers Glass is off to read and I put them on to read it is then set Jesus and to his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it Alma okay for what man what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul let us pray we thank you this morning once again for your grace and mercy foreign thank you Lord for all things the Glorious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen thank you Manana this morning I took this scripture because I want to take a very simple very basic a bit a very basic thoughts it's controversial or cause a discussion of something so the scripture we we read here the Lord is telling his disciples I want you to follow me at this moment the description we read the Lord is telling his disciples telling them something very basic very simple this is everyone wants to follow after me he asks them the questions number one is to deny yourself and follow me there's three very basic things two deniers itself is something very difficult because if we understand the word to deny yes yes deny yourself so to obtain your privileges from your privileges where the whole world is fighting for the rights and the whole world has rights inclusive here in the United States even the animals have rights even they have rights so the world is the rights because it was correspondent to us to live in this age that's what the Lord is saying Church age means it means the rights of the people and we're living in that time the whole world has rights but watch what the Lord Jesus says he says to deny yourself and that causes a controversy I'm in amen we started off wrong didn't we another thing the scripture says they say take up your cross number one is to deny yourself and then to take up your cross not the neighbor's Cross or the pastors but your own cross in other words your responsibility because what God has given you yes that's your responsibility that's your cross brother I don't have a Ministry you may not think so but um you have a calling or our ministry for God not everyone will be called to the same place or thing but what the Lord has called you to do you know say brother I'm not even married well you're you're you need to submit to your parents there's your responsibility when you're married you have more responsibility you have children for responsibility take up that responsibility take up that cross you understand just leave it there for a moment I don't want to awake too many and the difficulty thing is the following is first is to deny yourself take up your cross and then to follow that's the difficult so you're going to deny yourself you're going to deny your rights your privileges and then upon all that with all that it's not enough but then you got to follow Jesus Jesus what is the fall of Jesus took all the words the person comes to a moment in time where they are full of scars they have to follow the lord this is a controversial message so when Jesus says in the next verse because he who wants to save his life shall lose it everyone wants to save their life everyone wants to be right but Jesus said everyone who wants to save his life shall lose it and everyone for my sake or cause in other words the way the world says the religious world says it here's the religious world of that time against that system but there's no clue to Canada That's Why They Crucified the Lord won't you follow the law of Moses but what happens is he said it's not like that you painted the God got the wrong image difficult [Music] exactly the same thing religious world is you see it I'm not talking about an unbelieving people the religious world I have created a system he tells us what the word is it goes against their courage they can't accept it yeah it comes in a controversial ways his life because the controversial person you accept the message [Music] of the hour president it's difficult for a person [Applause] the current foreign [Music] you say brother explain to me how how that so we're going to go further into that let's read it Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes 8 verse 14. and here the the word says something to us very simple watch what the word says Ecclesiastes 14. the preacher says here there is Vanity which is done upon the Earth there'll be just men and to whom it happened according to the work of the wicked are you awake I'll repeat that there be just men again unto Whom It Happened according to the work of them to whom it happened is according to the work of the righteous I said that this is also vanity controversial this is something controversial amen amen how being a righteous man what would it happen to me like it like an unrighteous person a wicked person yeah that's the word brothers and those that behave us as a wicked person it happened to them as though they were righteous it's death but the answer is given to us by the word let's go to the Book of Psalms we'll be reading the first two verses amen amen this answers to us many of us that have a question that question say don't worry about the unrighteous here's your answer this is the word of the Lord says like this verse chapter 37 in the Book of Psalms spread not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity well they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb okay what does this mean this is it causes contention and also more so amongst the the believing people look Brothers to make it more simple uh the prophet speaks on the message of leadership he speaks of the original ruler is characteristics his characteristics you can find it on your time Luke Chapter 16. I.E there what catches my attention is this young man and he approaches the Lord and he asks a question that many ask themselves how many have we heard the the phrase the bad people that they receive good things I don't know if you've heard that why why does that happen is that if you want eternal life he says well you know the Commandments he speaks of The Commandments and he says uh teacher her master I have done all that since my youth is and the scripture says that Jesus is looking upon Him loved him that's tremendous I've fulfilled this to the letter what else do I lack the Lord says watch what he says if you want to be perfect all right perfect because in the following verse the Lord the Lord exposes that he was a tremendous man in this following verse it was a rich man well still all that you have and then when you sell it you give to the poor in other words deny yourself take up your cross man you see everything you have give to the poor then come and take up your cross and follow me the prophet says he was a young man with privilege and he had great status a man with a good reputation man that was taught and learned in the scripture in other words it was he was a very well he was without without blemish he went to church tremendous amongst the people the people were behind you an example to follow and he comes to Jesus what else do I need well if you want to be perfect you have to do this he understood but that was not for him how many people we would have thought if we knew them look at this tremendous man he's so successful what a great reputation yeah wow he was foolish he had a lot of inheritance and he had become very rich he taught within himself what shall I do with all this where should I store my my fruits says this I will do I will I will tear down my Storehouse and I will make and I will store upstairs you have them in store for many years I'm just arrested and rejoice just Rejoice but God said stubborn man and what you have who shall have it the prophet says it's the same man to follow [Music] look how tremendous he is that's how we see with our natural sight please but the description the prophet says that there was a man Rico he was rich he had a great feast which was much Splendor yeah but at the entrance of the House of this man there was a man by the name of Lazarus now many people think this is a parable let me tell you Brothers Jesus speaks a parable he never says names without a home he was a beggar and Fatima he was sick and La Puerta at the door asking or begging Rico he was at the door of the rich man all the feast that was taking place in that Homeless controversial messages is the man the scripture says that both died the rich man and Lazarus they both died the scripture says that the rich man is he found himself in in the depths of hell tribulation and he looked up he looked he's so Lazarus how is this possible that was at my house in everything that I've done everything I achieved here's my my reward it was Abraham not only dogs in other words in other words I was a believer of the message you understand Father Abraham the other one's down here it is but they won't even believe I'm finishing now okay look at Grandma's what do we believe in the message the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ look Brothers I'll be closing here with this scripture apocalypses Revelation chapter 16. a controversial message on [Music] Hermanos any of my brothers the word of the Lord says like this and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air is and there came a great voice out of the Temple of Heaven from the throne saying it is done it was the thunder and lightning Grande and a great uh earthquake Hamas which had never been before this man has been has been upon the earth and the great City Foreign to give to her cup from the wine of fierceness of his wrath and every everything every nation fled and the mountains were no longer found look Brothers we've understood this from the message the seven churches seven Messengers Seven Seals amen amen seven trumpets don't get scared here in the seventh vile or cup is it's poured out by the seventh uh Angelo that means there were six Angels you could read it in Revelation 16. the first Angel he poured his cup upon the Earth foreign I understand is foreign by the grace of God I've heard the scripture says then in the days watch what the scripture says not in the days of the 17th of the voice The Voice the ministers when a person goes to the Waters of baptism did you know when the person receives the baptism in water a sufficient savior and to surrender Lord and Lord it's as if you're getting married you are doing the voice of God you say yes I accept you are you help me you surrender ideas listen to me you are saved right there it's yours because you've accepted salvation that has nothing to do with being a part of the Bride you are saved estamos we are fighting to be a part of the Bride that's what the angel said he said come higher in other words go higher than what the denomination is higher than the world than the world denomination because it's a controversial message the world will tell you
