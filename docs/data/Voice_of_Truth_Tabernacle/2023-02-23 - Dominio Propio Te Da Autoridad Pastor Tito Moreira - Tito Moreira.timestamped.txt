[23:28] man someone leave it we are free
[23:35] of what he has done for us
[23:38] let us open our Bibles
[23:42] to the Book of Revelations chapter 2.
[23:45] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[24:00] [Music]
[24:34] um
[24:35] rewards
[24:38] the reward of self-dominium is
[24:42] the rewarded the age of the dieteria in
[24:45] lemons
[24:49] titled the self-control gives Authority
[24:52] is
[24:59] and he that overcometh and keepeth my
[25:02] Works unto thee and to him will I give
[25:04] power over the Nations
[25:14] and he shall rule them with the rod of
[25:15] iron as the vessels of a Potter's shall
[25:18] they be broken to Shivers even as I
[25:20] received of my father
[25:23] and I will give him the Morning Star let
[25:26] us pray Heavenly Father
[25:29] how good it is
[25:32] to know that you always that you always
[25:34] come to your uh to your meetings
[25:37] and the Bible says
[25:41] here's a let him hear what the spirit
[25:44] says into the churches
[25:46] for a reason you referred yourself to
[25:49] the church
[25:51] the reason you said what the spirit said
[25:53] to the church
[25:57] because you desire to give this church
[25:59] something Lord
[26:01] Iglesia when we come to church
[26:04] there's something special that you have
[26:06] for us
[26:08] you told us what the spirit
[26:29] you want to hear what you have to say
[26:30] foreign
[26:38] [Music]
[27:13] la
[27:28] La gratification
[27:30] let's go of instant gratification
[27:40] correct we've been speaking on how the
[27:43] control has has
[27:45] his mind is decided
[27:51] on what we're headed towards
[27:56] the fourth summary of this age that I'm
[28:00] going to be giving to you
[28:02] we'll be speaking on this rewards
[28:06] and how self-control gives Authority
[28:09] um
[28:17] a power to control something
[28:23] the context foreign
[28:36] perhaps you remember I don't know if you
[28:38] don't read it with me
[28:40] Matthew chapter 8 verse 5.
[28:43] this is
[28:49] and when Jesus was entered into a
[28:52] Capernaum there came unto him a
[28:54] centurion beseeching him it is
[29:01] and saying Lord my servant lieth at home
[29:04] sick of the palsy grievously tormented
[29:08] and Jesus said unto him I will come and
[29:11] heal him
[29:20] the Centurion answered and said Lord I
[29:22] am not worthy that thou should has come
[29:24] under my roof but speak the word only
[29:26] and my servant shall be healed in other
[29:29] words
[29:31] Jesus wanted to go over this sickly
[29:33] person
[29:35] this one that was tormented and the
[29:38] Centurion
[29:41] he says
[29:43] it's not necessary
[29:47] for you to go where he is
[29:52] he says because I am also a manager of
[29:55] authority
[29:58] having soldiers under me
[30:01] and I say to this man go ahead
[30:04] and to another comments
[30:07] and just my servant do this and he do
[30:10] with it
[30:11] when Jesus
[30:21] I have not found so great face
[30:31] and I say unto you that many shall come
[30:33] from the East and West and shall sit
[30:35] down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob
[30:37] how tremendous
[30:40] there shall be people like this
[30:43] people that aren't a part of Israel
[30:46] they're not a part of the Patriots
[31:05] but the children of the Kingdom shall be
[31:08] cast out into outer darkness that shall
[31:09] be weeping and gnashing of teeth
[31:18] and Jesus said unto the Centurion go thy
[31:21] way and as thou has believed so be it
[31:23] done unto thee and his servant was
[31:24] healed in the self-same hours
[31:27] if God could heal a servant
[31:31] of a pagan man or Roman man
[31:39] a Christian
[31:41] that should Elevate our faith
[31:45] now we're taking the story
[31:48] to speak a little bit
[32:48] but he gives it to him of his
[33:07] there's not a greater Authority than
[33:09] Gods
[33:14] we believe it but we truly don't know
[33:17] our lives reflect otherwise
[33:21] because there are things
[33:27] then even the word of God I repeat
[33:31] many of us here we could testify
[33:36] there are things in our lives
[33:42] then the word of God
[33:50] we have gotten many times
[33:53] our faith is much lower than this
[33:55] internship
[33:57] he said you don't even have to go Lord
[33:59] Jesus
[34:00] speak the word
[34:02] and my servant shall heal
[34:04] and we Brothers we have the words
[34:10] we don't give it the authority it
[34:12] deserves
[34:14] over our lives
[34:16] the word of God is
[34:20] very little authorities
[34:23] over lives of human beings
[34:43] much less over something else
[34:46] foreign
[35:22] that's how it should be
[35:24] okay but what happens
[35:28] he doesn't have authority over us
[35:34] because
[35:36] the child of God
[35:40] Jesus Christ
[35:42] not our Authority
[35:45] okay
[35:47] but it's what he did
[35:50] what is his word the reason
[35:53] that's the word of God
[35:56] has so much Authority
[35:58] it's because
[36:12] it comes from God
[36:18] for our lives
[36:21] but we don't give it to him
[36:25] unless somebody gives him the authority
[36:29] of God
[36:31] he doesn't have authority
[36:39] you may have power or he has power
[36:42] God has power over everything
[36:47] but we're the ones that give him the
[36:49] authority over our lives
[36:54] we allow him to use that power over us
[37:00] says a pardon a pardon isn't a pardon
[37:05] unless it's accepted as a party
[37:11] the president himself the one that wrote
[37:13] this note is
[37:17] he wrote that note that in order to
[37:20] deliver that that a person that was in
[37:22] prison he was in prison
[37:25] but the man saw that paper
[37:48] the result was said
[37:51] that
[37:53] a pardon is an apartment
[37:57] it's received as a party
[38:05] the benefits of that word
[38:09] forgiveness
[38:22] give authority to that word
[38:26] so much authority over us
[38:30] that is
[38:33] something great for us
[38:37] because he promised it is
[38:53] [Applause]
[39:07] you have to give it the authority
[39:13] how could you give it something to
[39:16] Authority that you
[39:20] first of all we don't respect
[39:23] sometimes we don't respect the word of
[39:25] God
[39:26] we don't respect what he said
[39:32] it says a lot of things we're like ah
[39:37] technology in order for some someone to
[39:40] have authority over you
[39:42] I'll
[39:44] correct in the correct manner I should
[39:47] say
[39:48] you have to respect that person
[39:54] many people
[39:57] they use the power incorrectly
[40:01] they use it without Authority
[40:05] as in
[40:07] I think
[40:10] they have people who do things
[40:12] forcefully
[40:17] but real Authority
[40:20] maybe father mother
[40:23] Pastor a leader
[40:26] it comes through respect
[40:31] you have to respect the word of God
[40:34] sometimes we don't even respect it
[40:36] but it's the truth
[40:40] don't respect this place
[40:43] we come here without reverence
[40:55] or power over us
[40:59] we should respect his words
[41:43] what does it mean for your life
[41:50] are you quiet because I'm scolding you
[41:53] or because you don't believe what I'm
[41:55] saying
[41:57] you're making me a little nervous
[42:00] oh yeah
[42:03] Centurion oh watch the Centurion
[42:08] he says
[42:12] I understand the authority
[42:16] because I have people under me
[42:19] and I tell them do this and they do it
[42:25] the word of God tells us to do this and
[42:28] we do the contrary
[42:30] yes
[42:37] authority of for us in the word of God
[42:44] then the word of God does come on church
[42:47] it's the truth
[42:52] [Music]
[42:55] the word of the enforcers are on
[42:58] Instagram have more authorities
[43:00] then the word of God
[43:03] yeah
[43:05] foreign
[43:53] and for what we need
[44:01] the devil laughs
[44:02] when we want him to a flee without
[44:06] Authority
[44:11] how are you going to come tell me to
[44:13] leave
[44:15] when you don't have anybody over you
[44:20] don't have anybody in the back
[44:23] you're not under anybody
[44:28] come with your own authority
[44:32] um
[44:38] that is backing him up
[44:40] the devil laughs Brothers
[44:52] how can you your word have more
[44:54] authority over me
[45:00] good question Brothers
[45:02] foreign
[45:13] [Applause]
[45:57] over you
[46:09] the Centurion said
[46:12] I am a man under authorities
[46:20] having soldiers
[46:24] and I said to this man go and he goes
[46:29] until I started to do this and he do
[46:32] with it how tremendous
[46:37] Jezebel
[46:43] she had power paramatar to a Kill yeah
[46:51] and she placed Idols
[46:53] she placed Idols to these
[46:58] priests
[47:00] and the Israelites and the Jewish people
[47:02] let me tell you
[47:05] what power does an idol have
[47:07] entertainment
[47:39] [Music]
[47:46] in the word of God over our lives
[48:25] I mean okay they say
[48:28] is
[48:37] now he says that he who keeps
[48:39] doing Works Faithfully unto the end will
[48:42] be given power of over Nations
[48:53] who can come so powerfully with any
[48:55] situation
[48:57] that even the most desperate enemies
[49:09] his demonstration rule by power will be
[49:11] like unto the very Sons
[49:26] it's much greater than the ones of the
[49:28] Nations
[50:01] [Applause]
[50:14] anything else
[50:32] he would leave
[50:38] we would cast out demons
[51:07] God should move us
[51:15] dead Idols us
[51:25] to believe in him
[51:28] to know that he can do anything
[51:33] Christianity versus idolatry he says he
[51:36] knows
[51:39] if you ever been baptized in the name of
[51:41] Jesus Christ
[51:43] there's a pool full of water here
[51:50] you're rising to walk with Christ in a
[51:53] new life
[52:12] and he raises you up by the Holy Ghost
[52:14] and sets you in Heavenly places with
[52:16] himself far above all powers of this
[52:18] world
[52:20] over all the powers of this world
[52:24] over all the powers of this world
[52:40] not devil
[52:45] as I was was with Moses says brother
[52:47] Bradham in this message
[52:53] recognize that Jesus of Nazareth had
[52:55] authority over sickness
[52:58] for he was a man in Authority
[53:06] now
[53:09] if he's going that way he said
[53:12] come back this way
[53:17] because he's an authority
[53:20] I'm talking about Jesus
[53:25] had that much Authority he must and more
[53:29] sickness
[53:42] I'm not worthy
[54:04] leave your word
[54:40] because we don't respect it foreign
[55:13] muerte
[55:43] in other words your daughters won't be
[55:45] able to do anything
[55:54] and I shall give everyone according to
[55:57] their works
[56:06] all the churches
[56:10] in other words
[56:12] in other words
[56:16] what is under us
[56:23] the denominations don't have power
[56:27] given by God
[56:31] over the cemetery God has no yeah
[56:45] they don't have any spiritual
[56:47] authorities
[56:48] no Spiritual Authority
[56:51] they're just like those dead
[56:53] they can't do anything
[56:55] but a son or daughter of God
[56:59] but below theirs Heavenly fathers
[57:11] as their father has
[57:14] the same Authority
[57:16] the same
[57:19] could you imagine
[57:22] how many believe that Brothers
[57:27] now look in the message and since that
[57:30] time
[57:32] when he was on the cross
[57:34] he said
[57:38] if you're a Son of God then The
[57:41] Descendant will believe
[57:44] when they placed a a filthy garment or
[57:47] the older interactions
[57:49] they're spitting on his face
[57:53] all the soldiers Hawking and spitting on
[57:55] his precious face the drunken
[59:37] and you do something good to them
[1:00:00] that's yours
[1:00:05] we need the power of God and to return
[1:00:07] good for evil
[1:00:37] can break chains
[1:00:39] right
[1:00:42] don't raise your hand but there's some
[1:00:44] Maniacs here
[1:00:52] we can break chains and break heads yeah
[1:00:59] put someone on the ground quick
[1:01:06] yes or yes Brothers
[1:01:19] that just proves that we're maniacs
[1:01:24] but it requires of a real man
[1:01:27] to return good for evil from his heart
[1:01:32] not because of a religious Duty
[1:01:35] Bob from his heart
[1:01:43] that's not the Son of God
[1:01:51] let that spit hang in his face
[1:02:48] [Applause]
[1:02:50] because my father told me
[1:02:55] not to do anything you got a story about
[1:02:57] how Tony is I'm under Authority
[1:03:02] come on church
[1:03:05] we need a little bit more don't we
[1:03:09] um
[1:03:11] stay still quiet and we talk more
[1:03:18] we know when God tells us something he
[1:03:22] says don't open your mouth don't say
[1:03:24] anything don't answer back
[1:03:27] he'll know who I am
[1:03:41] and we ignore it
[1:03:51] but when we get to the point
[1:03:55] where God says stay still
[1:03:59] and we say yes Lord yes if that's what
[1:04:02] you desire
[1:04:03] that's what you desire if that's your
[1:04:06] word
[1:04:07] if that's what pleases you
[1:04:09] then it pleases me Lord
[1:04:12] and that's what I want to do
[1:04:20] the demons begin to Trembley
[1:05:00] it's the works of God all right
[1:05:05] amen and today
[1:05:07] then the demons begin to tremble
[1:05:12] y
[1:05:13] then they don't know what to do
[1:05:17] SES
[1:05:20] we're entering into our position as Sons
[1:05:22] and Daughters
[1:05:25] where the Holy Ghost has control over us
[1:05:29] and our Authority is given unto us
[1:05:34] Jesus Provo Jesus proves moment in those
[1:05:38] crucial moments
[1:05:40] that's where he proved it
[1:05:44] how much power the word of God had over
[1:05:47] his life
[1:05:51] there Jesus
[1:05:55] how much Authority the word of God had
[1:05:57] over his life
[1:06:05] how much the word of God how much it
[1:06:08] matters
[1:06:27] word of God has over our life
[1:06:33] that's where Jesus Christ proved
[1:06:36] that the word of God
[1:06:39] we're still alive
[1:07:03] they respected what the Lord said
[1:07:07] he dare not do something different
[1:07:11] he said if I wanted to I want it
[1:07:16] Legion of angels
[1:07:32] Lord
[1:07:33] amen
[1:07:38] how could
[1:07:40] in that day
[1:07:43] how could the word of God in that day
[1:07:46] raises from the dead
[1:07:48] raise the body
[1:07:53] that is all corrupted and rotten from
[1:07:56] the grave
[1:07:59] when the word of God can't even move us
[1:08:02] to come to the office
[1:08:15] giving it that Authority here
[1:08:19] this is where the thing begins
[1:08:22] this is where it begins
[1:08:52] pull us out of this Earth
[1:08:56] Jesus Christ
[1:09:13] do you recognize today
[1:09:15] [Music]
[1:09:21] how do you recognize expect him to
[1:09:23] recognize you when you're in the tombs
[1:09:27] if you don't recognize him today
[1:09:32] if his word does nothing for us
[1:09:39] I say Lord okay
[1:09:42] how miserable I am
[1:09:45] the word hardly moves me Lord
[1:09:51] fight with us they have to yell at us
[1:10:02] keep speaking to us
[1:10:06] we're like oh
[1:10:10] one little step with so much pain
[1:10:14] or so much yelling
[1:10:20] it's almost that's how we are brothers
[1:10:24] as a pastor would you become discouraged
[1:10:27] but the word of God says I shouldn't
[1:10:30] complain
[1:10:32] but you become to get discouraged
[1:10:59] we have so many messages
[1:11:05] we listened
[1:11:08] oh Lord
[1:11:21] what else does God have to do
[1:11:25] the reality is we don't love him enough
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:30] in order for his word to mean something
[1:11:32] in our lives
[1:11:36] the truth is we don't respect his word
[1:11:42] we read the Bible as if it was like
[1:11:44] homework
[1:11:46] when it's a letter of love
[1:11:49] when
[1:11:51] it's the orders of Our Lord
[1:12:04] that's why our faith is weak
[1:12:09] because the authority of the the
[1:12:12] scriptures of the Holy Ghost
[1:12:13] man
[1:12:33] no wonder the Lord praised this uh
[1:12:37] Centurion so much
[1:12:41] he said he just wants my word
[1:12:49] would there be somebody here yes let's
[1:12:52] say Lord
[1:12:53] take me to that point
[1:12:56] like the Centurion
[1:13:02] as long as I know that you said
[1:13:07] that means so much to me
[1:13:15] send me wherever you desire to send me
[1:13:18] foreign
[1:13:25] do with me as you please
[1:13:35] these Saints from statutory
[1:13:38] they got a hold of that a little bit of
[1:13:41] work that's what kept him
[1:13:44] that's what kept Him just that little
[1:13:46] bit of word
[1:13:49] they grabbed the hold of the little that
[1:13:52] they had
[1:13:56] if it's just one word today
[1:13:59] grab hold of it because say Lord
[1:14:03] I want to put it to a work or a place
[1:14:08] I want to be what you desire me to be
[1:14:26] musicians can't come forward
[1:14:35] what does the word mean to you
[1:14:48] no wonder the Bible says
[1:14:54] the fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:14:57] wisdom
[1:14:59] fear there means respect
[1:15:03] that means a fear to fail him
[1:15:09] what he says
[1:15:13] to love what he says
[1:15:17] because when you love what he says
[1:15:24] you're scared of failing
[1:15:33] I don't know to what level the word of
[1:15:36] God moves you
[1:15:38] yourself have to answer that question
[1:15:42] foreign
[1:15:44] [Music]
[1:15:46] if he says go do you go
[1:15:49] if he says come to you come
[1:15:51] [Music]
[1:15:56] on
[1:15:58] I don't know how much power the word of
[1:16:01] God has over your life
[1:16:07] if you want authorities
[1:16:10] if you want those demons
[1:16:19] and depend on idols
[1:16:26] come on to the authority of God's word
[1:16:31] come and say Lord here I am
[1:16:33] I want to love your words more than life
[1:16:37] itself
[1:16:39] I want to love what you say
[1:16:42] okay
[1:16:43] I want you to move me Lord
[1:16:45] [Music]
[1:16:47] I want to hear the message

[1:16:57] I don't want to just come to church and
[1:17:00] nothing happens
[1:17:05] why because I didn't give you that
[1:17:07] authority over my life
[1:17:11] would you give him that authority over
[1:17:13] your life
[1:17:14] give him that authority over your life
[1:17:17] let him be said
[1:17:20] him the one giving you the power
[1:17:23] to overcome
