[28:00] a
[28:02] [Music]
[28:14] we
[28:15] [Music]
[28:23] [Music]
[28:34] as you are standing can you please
[28:35] accompany me to psalms 56 11.
[28:40] we give thanks to god
[29:03] in god i have trusted i will not fear
[29:05] what can man do to me
[29:08] is
[29:12] also if we can go to the scripture
[29:13] exodus 14 9.
[29:17] we're speaking on moses
[29:22] and the deliverance from
[29:24] of the people of israel from egypt
[29:28] exodus
[29:38] control
[29:46] therefore the egyptians with all the
[29:48] cavalry and chariots of pharaoh his
[29:50] horsemen and all his army overtook them
[29:52] and camped by the sea next to
[29:54] paiha hakhira in front of balse
[30:06] is
[30:10] and when pharaoh had drawn near the
[30:12] children of israel raised their eyes and
[30:14] behold the egyptians were coming after
[30:16] them therefore the children of israel
[30:18] were greatly afraid and cried out to the
[30:20] lord
[30:32] and they said to moses
[30:34] were there no tombs in egypt that you
[30:36] have brought us out to die in the desert
[30:38] why have you done this to us that you
[30:40] have brought us out to eat out of egypt
[30:48] foreign
[30:53] it's not this when we spoke to you in
[30:54] egypt saying let us serve the egyptians
[30:57] because it would be better for us to
[30:59] serve the egyptians than to die in the
[31:00] desert
[31:17] and moses said to the people fear not
[31:19] stand firm and see the salvation that
[31:21] jehovah will do with you today because
[31:24] the egyptians that you have seen today
[31:26] you will never see them again forever
[31:41] then the lord said to moses why do you
[31:43] cry out to me tell the children of
[31:45] israel to march
[31:56] and you raise your rod and extend your
[31:58] hand over the sea and divide it and the
[32:00] children of israel will enter through
[32:02] the middle of the sea and drag on dry
[32:04] ground
[32:07] if we complete our heads
[32:09] your heavenly father
[32:11] we give you thanks lord
[32:26] lord may you open our ears in our
[32:28] understanding of our brothers
[32:31] so that they may be able to discern
[32:35] and if something air comes out of my
[32:36] mouth
[32:39] may they be able to rebuke it lord
[32:50] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[32:52] amen amen
[32:54] you may be seated
[32:58] as a title
[32:59] romano marcial brother marshall
[33:02] fernando fernando
[33:08] we decided
[33:25] to bring out moses and all the people of
[33:27] egypt
[33:31] moses had the israel
[33:33] moses had the commission to bring their
[33:36] people out of egypt
[33:41] god had commissioned him
[33:44] and he backed him up
[33:49] moses was the
[34:03] and to bring things to existence
[34:26] and the burning bush
[34:29] the pillar of fire throughout the night
[35:00] the people of israel and moses believed
[35:02] in
[35:02] egypt
[35:07] how much they had progressed in their
[35:08] faith
[35:10] now moses was the man of faith
[35:14] god
[35:24] and we can separate the scriptures just
[35:25] a little bit
[35:27] in the version
[35:53] moses said to the people fear not stand
[35:55] firm and see the salvation that jehovah
[35:57] will do with you today because the
[35:58] egyptians that you have seen today will
[36:01] never see them again forever
[36:05] jehovah will fight for you and you will
[36:07] be calm
[36:10] moses being
[36:37] of israel to march
[37:03] and the preaching i had heard but now i
[37:05] see in 65 see
[37:28] moses in the crisis cried out and we
[37:30] find out in exodus the 14th chapter and
[37:33] the 13th chapter to the 16th verse moses
[37:36] in that big squeeze
[37:37] there
[37:39] with the children of israel's
[37:40] inspiration stuck him struck him and he
[37:43] said that he had to say
[37:45] not knowing that he had to say it see
[37:48] stand fast and see the salvation of god
[37:59] so you stand firm and you will see the
[38:01] salvation of god because the egyptians
[38:04] whom you have seen today you'll never
[38:05] see again
[38:13] they said why'd you bring me out of
[38:14] egypt where there are no tombs over
[38:15] there nostra history
[38:30] god
[38:32] he was inspired and said
[38:35] stand firm
[38:37] and you'll see the salvation of god
[38:42] because the egyptians we have seen today
[38:44] you will never see them again
[38:48] how did he know that that was going to
[38:49] happen
[38:53] he did not know what he spoke
[38:56] of
[38:56] that was god speaking through music
[39:18] he said take out your staff and stretch
[39:20] it out and stretch out your hand over
[39:22] the c and tell the children to march
[39:54] and sometimes
[40:22] they say
[40:46] number three
[41:14] the inspiration that's how it impacts
[41:15] you if you're sick that's how it impacts
[41:17] you if you're afflicted something is
[41:19] real to you and you see it revealed and
[41:21] you say i've been healed
[41:32] today
[41:34] then god tells him what what to do get
[41:36] up and start walking amen it's all over
[41:41] when you can do it that way
[41:43] that's how god does it
[41:48] so you can see god manifesting himself
[41:49] through you puedios
[41:52] it was god who told him to do it
[41:55] now everyone that was present
[41:59] that was present
[42:13] and that pillar of fire led them across
[42:15] the scene
[42:17] i heard about god
[42:19] but then they saw it
[42:23] and how many of us have seen god
[42:26] how many of us have seen god in our
[42:28] lives
[42:50] he was given a dry staff
[42:55] mostly staff
[42:57] represents many things
[43:01] among one of those things
[43:04] i want to take this
[43:06] is fight always
[43:17] it was not the right of moses the
[43:18] australian he says
[43:20] god had moses in his hands
[43:23] and what that was in moses hands
[43:43] [Music]
[43:51] god's promises are at everyone's reach
[43:56] [Music]
[44:06] promises
[44:11] even though we may not understand all
[44:12] the mind of god
[44:14] we can say that the bride
[44:17] can understand the mind
[44:48] do
[44:51] maybe you can see i'm not a prophet
[44:54] hey i'm not a teacher no
[44:56] i don't have a great title
[44:59] but you have the word
[45:01] you have to promise
[45:16] because
[45:30] and regretfully we sometimes reject it
[45:33] because we can't see
[45:36] how god works
[45:38] but let's give thanks to god
[45:41] for this a message
[45:43] and a prophet
[45:55] just grab hold of the words
[46:13] that see in front of you
[46:15] remember
[46:21] he didn't give you the promise today
[46:24] before the foundation of the world
[46:40] amen and god bless you
[46:45] man amen
[46:51] what beautiful word
[46:54] how beautiful
[47:17] and when pharaoh drew 9 the children of
[47:19] israel lifted up their eyes
[47:24] and behold the egyptians marched after
[47:26] them
[47:29] and they were sore afraid
[47:33] and the children of israel cried out
[47:34] unto the lord
[47:50] they
[48:32] every day
[48:34] difficulties every day
[48:36] we go through fears every day
[48:40] we go through temptations every day
[48:44] they they're scared
[49:11] [Music]
[49:13] and they began to remember
[49:28] and that happens to
[49:29] [Applause]
[49:44] or drinking except that acceptance or
[49:46] etc
[49:48] many times that's what happened to
[49:50] afghans
[49:53] that we think we're going to be better
[49:55] the way we were
[50:37] perhaps right now what we see is only
[50:39] that
[50:41] that there's no way out
[50:44] the children
[50:46] they found the reds
[50:48] they saw the red sea and they didn't
[50:49] find a way out
[51:07] and here the people of israel found
[51:09] themselves
[51:12] with a beautiful party
[51:15] is that god tells moses
[51:18] everyone begins to cry
[51:33] why do you cry
[51:35] speak
[51:36] habla speak
[51:39] and he spoke bro
[51:41] and what happened brothers
[51:44] you spoke the word of god
[51:48] the
[52:14] i don't know where to go
[52:30] i
[52:44] but we don't
[53:26] what
[53:40] i'm in the same world
[53:54] is
[54:48] is
[55:46] a little bit of dirt
[55:49] you can ride
[55:53] can flow and bloom
[55:56] look brothers
[55:59] we're not playing church necesitable
[56:41] what god has sent us out to do
[56:45] man
[56:48] and just as i speak
[56:51] that's how my battles are brothers
[56:55] and now you know why i speak the way i
[56:57] speak
[57:00] much man
[57:03] many know my story
[57:07] he says
[57:10] he's calling
[57:24] and that's where god wants to take us
[57:26] brothers
[57:27] amen brothers
[57:29] meet it look
[57:52] and moses knew that god had sent him
[57:55] he just said lord
[58:01] he fell in the doorway of the tabernacle
[58:05] separate yourself
[58:19] a disguise
[58:30] is
[58:48] you don't do things
[59:02] porque
[59:16] yes
[59:58] now don't stay in just
[1:00:26] come on
[1:00:52] the word of god
[1:01:36] didn't
[1:01:48] many times we think that the situation
[1:01:50] we find ourselves in yo
[1:01:52] that god said he would be with you
[1:01:55] and the problem would just vanish
[1:01:58] that's a great problem
[1:02:02] that god does things in his life
[1:02:32] and he says each one of them made the
[1:02:33] same thing
[1:02:35] they all dance in the spirit
[1:02:39] they all had everything in common
[1:02:42] but when it came time to separate
[1:02:46] the word
[1:03:01] brothers separa it separates
[1:03:04] it separates us
[1:03:06] it separates us from it
[1:03:08] it separates us
[1:03:13] because we have to separate ourselves
[1:04:10] you have no luck
[1:05:48] he wants to shut us up one way or
[1:05:49] another
[1:05:52] but he's not going to shut us up
[1:05:54] he's not going to quite
[1:05:57] continue speaking of the word of god
[1:06:01] and we're going to continue going
[1:06:02] forward fernando esperando brother

[1:06:45] brother missile uh we read them
[1:06:48] and it says like this
[1:06:54] israel
[1:06:55] then the lord said to moses why are you
[1:06:57] crying out to me tell the israelites to
[1:06:59] move on
[1:07:11] erase your staff and stretch out your
[1:07:12] hand over the sea to divide the water so
[1:07:14] that the israelites can go through the
