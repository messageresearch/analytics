joyful because we will speak of his words his word is as you're standing let's read the word first of Samuel chapter eight when you have it if you can say Amen verse 4. they say entonces Los Angeles then all the Elders of Israel gather themselves together and came to Samuel and tirama and said unto him behold thou are old and thy Sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us as like all the nations foreign foreign hands of God and the people of Israel Dios they didn't want to live like God had acquired of them or they live they want to live like the rest as the world lives in the church these days blessed be the name of the Lord people want to live Brothers he came to restore a bride unless it be the Lord is good Brothers is uh uh in the message rejected key now I took this quote and it says like this the people were a great deal they had come to a place and on the world to replace the wine to be like other people they want to be like other people that is just simply a nature with peace each other they say if you'll go out and buy he says and go buy a certain kind of clothing or a certain cars paint your steps a certain color in your house or on your steps they say okay says watch the neighbor you just can't stand it blessed be the Lord we have to live the life that's what people want to see nowadays with their life people in these times Brothers vanity that will remain in this world because it has to be the Lord you come with a certain type of hat they say that's a little different that's a little different next Sunday you'll have a lot of sisters with that same kind of hat she said blessed be the Lord they say sisters but these people in the downstairs they saw the Philistines and the unbelieving is and they say we want to be like them what a mistake I've already seen all of his promises Hermanos Prophet says that that that food over here is the same blessed be the Lord God is good it's a human mind I saw what happened in the in the days of Adam [Applause] wanted to cover him it didn't work foreign [Music] [Music] it's helping my spiritual life foreign see in those four minutes I want to tell you okay just as I'm doing that fast that is helping me that if you haven't taken it this year propose yourself many times I'm scared of being here the prophet says obedience to the words I don't want to be the same I want to be a child foreign foreign foreign God bless you Brothers if you can turn with me to First Samuel verse 1. and our title for tonight is quickened by his word or revive by his word [Music] amen as you're turning I'm just gonna give a little introduction you know what's going on God bless our brother and uh the Philistines were the foes of Israel in this time is and they were in constant conflict Israel usually got the worst of it and the Philistines had already entered into the Iron Age so the Philistines were had Superior weapons and the Philistines have been oppressing the people of israelisters so Israel was crying to the Lord now in all of the churches Samuel was the last and we find out he's established as a spiritual leader spiritual and now we'll begin reading verse one of Samuel 7. and I'm going to ask you to be following me because we're going to read 12 verses amen and it says and the men of kirith Jerome came and fetched up the Ark of the Lord and brought it into the house of abimindab in the hill and Sanctified Eliezer his son to keep the Ark of the Lord that the time was long for it was 20 years and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord so chapter five and sixes houses that the sons of Eli took the ark into battles and the Philistines conquered the ark enes and Eli's children died in battle and then a couple details of Phyllis signs got hemorrhoids and they were dealing with rats and other diseases tomorrow and they realize that so that they had the ark and the Ark of God decapitated their God Dios Solo solo was able to deliver himself without anybody's help that gets me excited God doesn't need help amen now chapter 7 is a transition chapter God has spoken to Samuels the people's hearts are breaking because they're not satisfied with the corruption and they're aching for a relationship with God yes and then verse three reads and Samuel speaking to other house of Israel saying if you do return unto the Lord with all your hearts then put away the strange gods and ashrath from among you and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of Philistines foreign and turn back to the Lord no more no more of we have the Lord and we serve another Lord no more of doing both things the Lord will be the only one you serve okay and then God will deliver you so verse 4 says then the children of Israel did put away Balaam and asheroth and serve the Lord only so now verse 5 they're gonna have a gathering of the Nations and verse 5 says and Samuel said gather all Israel to miss but I will pray for you unto the Lord this is and Drew water and poured it out before the Lord and fasted on the day and said we have sinned against the Lord and Samuel judged the children of Israel in mizpah is so the nation is rededicating their lives in this place it's a national repentance they're all confessing their sins to the Lord and now here's the action in verse 7. and when the Philistines her that the children of Israel we're gathered together to Mitzvah the Lords of Philistines went up against Israel so a Revival is happening a great meeting oh forgive me go ahead so there's a Revival happening the entire nation is in one spot they're all assembled and they're vulnerable it is foreign that's right and when the children of Israel heard it they were afraid of the Philistines so why were they afraid of the Philistines a number of things the Philistines had unmatched weapons Israel was not in the Iron Age yet the Philistines are chariots and their technology was against them another thing Israel was not meeting for a war meeting and when you think about going to church when we come to church we don't think about bringing a gun or a bat no pensamos or a weapon they're coming we come to confess our sins and here they're coming to turn to the lord they're having a spiritual focused events and the enemy comes at the same event with weapons and Israel is unarmed [Music] this this backstory is very powerful esta Historia is I can just take it for today if somebody's waiting for us outside so verse 8 says and the children of Israel said to Samuel sees not to cry unto the Lord Our God for us that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines the relational foreign offering holy unto the Lord and Samuel Cried unto the Lord for Israel and the Lord heard him this is so he offers a sacrifice and then praise and that was that was their action yes that was that was what they did that's that's wild for me verse 9 says the Lord heard him but how did God hear them and verse 10 says and Samuel was offering up the burnt offering and it keeps saying but the Lord thundered with a great Thunder on that day upon the Philistines and discomforted them and they were smitten before the Lord for Israel they realized something bigger was happening the Philistines realize something bigger was happening they said we're in trouble now so what did Israel do to make this happen confess their sins turn away from idols and rededicated their lives to God and say and said I'm gonna destroy them while they pray and God wipes out their enemy with a noise and verse 12 says this is the main point of this reading principal then Samuel took her son and said it between mispo and Shannon called the name of it Ebenezer saying hitherto hath the Lord helped us is and the message is that the Lord helps us the Lord has helped us God helps those who can't help themselves God helps people that cry out God helps people that are in trouble and God helps people that confess my brother was saying think of Samson's son who pulled down a temple on himself and killed the majority of Philistines in his death and somewhere then in his life and Samuel without a battle is without military had a prayer meeting and that wiped out the Philistines and they put up a monumento that the Lord helped us I want to read a quote by Charles Spurgeon 1863 it says I think we have been in similar circumstances the victory obtained was by the lamb El La Victoria as soon as the lamb was slaughtered and the smoke went up to heaven the blessing began to descend upon the Israelites and the curse upon the foes brother and if we had done anything for Christ if we have achieved any victories if in this house any Souls have been converted really hard Sanctified any trooping Spirits comforted their witness that it has been all through the lamb testifique when we have picture try slaughtered we describe the agonies which he endured upon the cross then we have tried to preach fully through feebly the great doctrine of this substitutionary sacrifice foreign you have overcome your foes you have slaughtered your sins you have mastered your troubles how has it been from the altar of that bleeding lamb this is the Throne of him who is to Reign forever and ever the whole Road has been stained with the Crimson blood of your enemies the lamb shall overcome Ebenezer hitherto the Lord hath helped us but the help has always been through the lambes the bleeding living and reigning lamp says a song of degrees of David it had been not if it had been forgive me if it had not been the Lord who was on our side now may Israel say s [Music] the Lord who was on our side when men rose up against us then they have swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us then the waters had overwhelmed us the stream had gone over our soul blessed be the Lord who have not given us as prey to their teeth our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the Fowlers and snare the snare is broken and we are escaped Nosotros our help is in the name of the Lord who made Heaven and Earth and one more scripture second Corinthians verse but we heard the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raises the Dead [Music] who delivered us from so great a death and doth delivered in whom we trust and that he will yet Deliver Us bendiga [Applause] our Lord Grande we have a great God a God who has not left it's a pleasure to see our brothers a warrior and I just get very happy because that's your description first Samuel chapter 7 verse 3. amen let's read it this is like this is taken to all the house of Israel saying if you do not return unto the Lord with all your hearts then put away the strange God in astronauts from among you and prepare your hearts unto the Lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hands of the Philistines [Music] they couldn't even withstand because of the situation is Hercules to the holy things what's killing me I get too attached to the gods of this foreign I say this because I also have things I deal with and I'm not judging you Hallelujah I'm with you I know that we're in a war in a battles now that we all go through difficulties I know that we're all being hurt but I just want to tell you bro that we can use it in our time look Brothers she can have children yeah she cried out to God I believe that there are many mothers here who prayed for their children that was the life of Samuels he came through and answered now Samuel according to this he began to discover what he was called one of the questions what was I saying on this Earth foreign or manifest the work of God through you now Samuel because he fills because the Lord and he would go and check with Eli he said why have he called me I haven't called you he's welcome and the voice of God came back he called them three times four times hear that voice once again just just say back here oh yeah now what he did he heard the voice he was a judge he was the last judge that there was in at that era in that time after that would come the Kings because of the pleasures of life I've always wanted to be like the rest but the people of God we can't be like the rest although we try okay we try and force ourselves to be a part of it I had good news for you you won't be able to promise God you do away with all of those Gods let's prepare our hearts for the Lord and let's serve him only serve him the only God can give you that right and I have no doubt I have not won doubt okay I only tell you that it can be done [Music] little steps and it can be done just one step at a time because I'm a witness when I hear the voice of God when I hear my pastors God is with you let's take one step and when you do away with it do away with those Gods it can be done look Voya I'm going to read this message glory to God a true sign that's overlooked Miriam look this is whatever you do don't you forget my words that you won't forget it so don't forget it I'll see you see this saith the Lord return to God with all your hearts something that the devil hates is that a Son of God repent to repent and to get back on the path of God you always know that it doesn't matter what you decide it matters and it hurts although there will be consequences let's always have this in our minds with open arms come back don't rely upon an emotion on a sensation foreign yo realmente I truly you know I don't want to live um Rush my my job is very rushed yes and it's very horrible God's um God's path to be right I want to appreciate with this it's a reflection it's a story and it says come forward [Music] of hiding human happiness he is and they were kind of talking about where to hide it and one of them the hide it in the highest mountain intelligence but they said that I think there's going to be someone smart enough to go and find that and another said let's go hide in another planet and everyone said that oh they built a rocket and go find it on the planet and everyone would then be happy it was [Music] so then I don't know where the most quiet person Nicole the quiet person in the room he said let's hide it within them that they won't find it there [Music] foreign [Music] but it lies upon you it falls on you to realize that it's that God is there can you stop yours that God is there amen healing it begins from the inside our delivery it goes from the inside out and God wants us to see what he has deposited and that we'd be able to rent it and that we could serve him and only him oh it is youth I speak to you from my heart search for what God has given you within you yes sir yeah and there you will find what will make you happy give yours may God be with
