[21:06] to the book of genesis and hennessey's
[21:09] chapter 25 20 cinco or verse 20 versus
[21:14] uh we'll be starting on uh some we'll be
[21:16] making the transition
[21:20] into uh some uh some some other bible
[21:23] characters
[21:27] uh we'll be transitioning from rebecca
[21:29] to
[21:30] jacob and esau
[21:35] amen amen
[21:38] let us
[21:39] read the word
[21:43] and the word of god says like this
[21:46] and isaac was 40 years old when he took
[21:49] rebecca to wife
[21:50] the daughter of bethel the syrian of
[21:53] padan aram the sister to laban the
[21:55] syrian
[22:05] and isaac entreated and treated the lord
[22:08] for his wife because she was barren and
[22:10] the lord wasn't treated of him and
[22:12] rebecca his wife conceived
[22:23] and the children struggled together
[22:25] within her and she said if it be so why
[22:27] am i thus
[22:29] and she went to inquire of the lord
[22:39] and the lord said unto her two nations
[22:41] are in thy womb
[22:42] and two manner of people shall be
[22:44] separated from thy bowels
[22:46] and the one people shall be stronger
[22:47] than the other people and the elders
[22:49] shall serve the younger yes
[23:06] lord this evening
[23:09] to be able to be in your presence
[23:12] and we just ask that you manifest
[23:14] yourself through your word
[23:17] and that you would speak to your
[23:18] children
[23:20] you would look at their hearts
[23:23] and no and and see their needs
[23:27] and that you would uh that you would
[23:28] give to them according to their needs
[23:32] we ask that at the end of the service
[23:34] your holy name would be glorified father
[23:39] we set ourselves aside so that you would
[23:40] speak to yourself
[23:43] we ask this in the name of our lord
[23:44] jesus christ jesus christ amen amen you
[23:47] may be seated
[24:07] we just decided to uh
[24:10] the struggle is real
[24:16] amen we we see uh
[24:20] that um isaac and rebecca had uh he they
[24:23] they became husband and wife
[24:28] and uh you know they they desire to have
[24:30] children like any uh marriage would
[24:32] desire
[24:36] but you know it wasn't given to man to
[24:38] uh give life
[24:41] you know the only one that can give life
[24:44] is god
[24:54] [Music]
[24:58] he's the only one that can give life
[25:02] amen amen and we see
[25:06] that isaac goes in and prays to the lord
[25:11] you see he acknowledged that god was the
[25:12] only one that could give life
[25:17] you know and the lord heard his prayer
[25:21] and we see that rebecca
[25:23] was to conceive
[25:36] there was a struggle going on inside of
[25:38] her
[25:53] that this was not an external
[26:07] it became almost unbearable for for uh
[26:10] rebecca
[26:13] you know and she go and she inquires of
[26:14] the lord
[26:19] and she's like i want to know what's
[26:20] happening within me consultant seniority
[26:33] and the struggle is not with with the
[26:36] outer
[26:50] is you know but there's nothing wrong
[26:53] wrong with struggle
[26:56] you know i've i've grown to understand
[27:01] that uh the struggle
[27:04] is
[27:18] fuerza you cannot get stronger
[27:24] if you don't have a struggle
[27:27] so you're you're becoming stronger
[27:31] you're starting to develop
[27:45] but he wants you to get your strength
[27:59] i've tried to do what i wanted to do
[28:04] but that but that that doesn't work for
[28:06] me
[28:07] no no
[28:08] no and i don't think it'll work for any
[28:10] true son or daughter of god
[28:13] you could try whatever you want
[28:24] whatever you decide to do without god
[28:28] it will be
[28:43] you know when you're struggling
[28:47] i think a lot of us don't like to uh
[28:49] necessarily admit it
[28:54] we don't like to say when we're
[28:56] struggling
[29:10] when you begin this christian walk
[29:14] christiano if if you read your bible
[29:18] you'll understand
[29:20] that this the christian walk
[29:24] it's going to be a struggle i said
[29:27] he never said it was going to be easy
[29:31] but he said it was going to be a
[29:33] struggle
[29:35] you know and if you're not struggling
[29:52] every christian will have a struggle
[29:56] this burst that was about to take place
[30:01] it came with the struggle
[30:03] and i want to let you know
[30:06] that you
[30:13] [Music]
[30:20] one day you'll be doing great
[30:24] but the next day it seems like you're
[30:26] being attacked on all sides
[30:30] it seems like you're coming from all
[30:32] over the place
[30:34] it seems like it's a foreign invasion
[30:38] it is a war
[30:40] you say because it's the devil and god
[30:44] that are struggling
[30:46] you know and i want to share something i
[30:48] read one time i believe it was it was
[30:51] charles spurgeon
[30:52] charles spurgeon that said this
[30:55] he says that's how you know your true
[30:57] value is
[31:44] he's
[32:05] [Applause]
[32:10] [Applause]
[32:16] [Music]
[32:22] [Applause]
[32:40] from within
[32:48] was going to be determined quite a bit
[32:50] of things actually
[32:53] but it was actually
[32:56] the beginning of the
[32:58] of god's uh well not necessarily the
[33:00] beginning of god's people
[33:06] but out of them would be two nations
[33:22] in other words
[33:25] believers and unbelievers
[33:30] spiritual espiritualis and earthly
[33:34] carnales amen amen that's right i want
[33:38] to read verse 23.
[33:44] and it reads like this
[33:45] it is a scene and the lord said unto her
[33:50] let's go reverse 24 excuse me
[33:53] cuatro and when her days to be delivered
[33:55] were fulfilled
[33:57] behold there were twins in her womb
[34:04] and the first came out red all over like
[34:06] a hairy uh garment
[34:08] and they called his name esau
[34:14] and after that came his brother
[34:18] call jacob
[34:24] excuse me i came his brother out and his
[34:26] hand took hold on esau's heel especially
[34:33] and his name was called jacob
[34:36] and isaac was three score years old when
[34:38] she bared them
[34:43] and the boys grew
[34:45] los ninos and
[34:54] [Music]
[35:13] amen
[35:14] amen
[35:16] and i i want to talk about esau for some
[35:18] moments
[35:21] and the kind of man that he was
[35:25] no we read that you know the boys grew
[35:27] up
[35:41] he was an
[35:42] athlete amen amen
[35:45] he liked recreation
[35:49] eli he liked to do the fishing you know
[35:51] the hunties
[35:54] you know he was the strong one
[35:57] he was your you know he was he was a
[35:59] sports guy
[36:02] he was the one all the girls were after
[36:04] you know in high school
[36:07] that that's exactly what it is
[36:10] yes
[36:36] that's the kind of guy he was
[36:52] he was
[36:59] [Music]
[37:04] he appeared to be stronger than jacob
[37:06] mas fuerte que jacob
[37:14] because it says jacob was a plain man
[37:19] dwelling in tents
[37:22] so he was uh he was uh you know he was
[37:24] about the home anton says
[37:26] gustavo started la casa he was about you
[37:29] know the things of the house
[37:33] you know that that's what he likes
[37:36] amen amen
[37:37] but we see that
[37:40] as they grew up
[37:42] you see as you begin to grow in the lord
[37:44] listen and senor
[37:46] sooner or later
[37:48] what is inside of you
[37:52] what is inside of you
[37:55] sooner or later
[37:57] it will come out
[38:00] it'll come out
[38:02] your fruits
[38:17] that's why i believe i gotta trust the
[38:19] process
[38:22] i gotta trust the process
[38:25] that god has put me in here
[38:28] it may be a slow process
[38:44] time passes
[38:46] you see and these men these young men
[38:48] they begin to grow
[38:51] you see the desires inside of you
[38:54] but they begin to grow
[38:57] you see what is inside of you okay
[39:00] what you want
[39:02] it begins to come out
[39:05] it's no longer just a thought anymore
[39:09] but that thought becomes becomes words
[39:23] yeah but i mean
[39:25] it just it just starts with something
[39:27] small
[39:29] but it begins to develop
[39:32] you do what you truly are
[39:35] amen amen and we see it one day
[39:40] um
[39:45] if you go to um verse 30 to 32.
[39:54] it reads like this
[39:57] and esau said to jacob
[40:02] where it says i'll die
[40:05] in the quotes
[40:08] genesis 25 verse 30.
[40:11] esau had just came from a hunt
[40:16] and he he was hungry
[40:19] i can i can relate to him
[40:36] yes
[40:49] [Music]
[40:50] therefore
[41:04] i am at the point to die
[41:08] and what profit shall this burst ripe
[41:10] birthright do to me
[41:13] yeah i i
[41:15] i really like what it says there i never
[41:17] caught it
[41:31] if that doesn't happen to us a lot of
[41:32] times
[41:44] i wonder if we're not at the point of
[41:45] where we feel like we're gonna die
[41:50] and you know the question actually is
[41:53] yes what is it that you're hungering for
[41:58] what is it that you're thirsting for
[42:00] forget that
[42:15] to know
[42:17] but you don't get the clothes you want
[42:20] you don't get the shoes you want
[42:22] those oh you don't get the job you want
[42:24] yourself
[42:25] oh you feel like you're gonna die
[42:28] i stopped
[43:23] if i don't have him
[43:36] i could live without all those other
[43:38] things
[43:43] [Music]
[44:26] [Applause]
[44:44] as far as your flesh
[44:46] is no different from a horse or from a
[44:48] cow or
[45:08] that's right
[45:10] it says but your flesh is just dust of
[45:11] the earth like the animal correct
[45:44] yes
[46:26] he
[46:40] listen
[46:53] [Music]
[46:55] it says you're a slave of the devil
[46:57] diablo and you'll crucify the soul
[46:59] that's in you crucification
[47:02] for the bible said
[47:05] the soul that sin
[47:07] is shall die
[47:21] so you're a slave anyway you take it
[47:24] and you can't get away from it
[47:27] you can't get away from it
[47:30] but we have to make the decision
[47:33] i spoke about the earthly things
[47:43] god
[47:45] [Applause]
[48:02] hope i can catch up to him
[48:19] they were the children
[48:22] of the children of the promise
[48:26] and they were not excluded
[48:29] they were not excluded
[48:32] it had
[48:34] [Music]
[48:44] so genesis 25 will only be reading verse
[48:46] 26
[48:50] i like the significance as it says in
[48:52] spanish
[48:54] i searched it in english and it doesn't
[48:55] say it
[48:57] but i put it there for my interpreter
[49:05] and after that came his brother out and
[49:07] his hand took hold of his esau's heel
[49:10] evoeyamados
[49:12] and his name was called jacob el catoma
[49:14] puerto
[49:17] [Music]
[49:25] and isaac was three square years old
[49:27] when she bare them and
[49:51] and just like in rebecca there is two
[49:53] beings
[49:55] in each and every one of them as well
[49:57] there was two natures
[50:00] within us
[50:02] there's two natures
[50:08] in the message communion he says
[50:11] [Music]
[50:23] i was saying this taking for myself
[50:31] like he was going to say william brown
[50:33] well 40 years ago the william branham it
[50:35] isn't the same one tonight

[50:51] charles and ella branham portland
[51:04] [Music]
[51:06] and all the habits of the world laid
[51:07] right there right in me pero tambien
[51:10] but in there
[51:15] was another nature presence
[51:19] predestinated
[51:34] now the apostle paul says in romans 7
[51:39] 7 18 it says
[51:43] for i know that in me that is in my
[51:45] flesh
[51:46] [Music]
[51:47] no good things
[51:50] for to will is present within me
[51:55] but how to perform that which is good i
[51:56] find not quantized
[51:58] how many can identify themselves with
[52:00] this
[52:14] but the evil which i do i would not that
[52:37] that when i would do good evil that i
[52:39] when i would do good evil is present
[52:40] within me
[52:42] so that's nature
[53:12] he shall
[53:26] i find in a law
[53:30] i find in a law
[53:32] that when i would do good it was present
[53:35] within me
[53:40] for i delight in the law of god after
[53:42] the inward man
[53:43] there is another man
[53:47] desires the things of god
[53:52] we were all born with this
[54:23] he wanted to be first
[54:27] like many of us
[54:30] we want to be first to win everything
[54:33] he wanted the blessings
[54:36] he wanted
[54:54] [Music]
[55:17] blue eyes
[56:00] another
[56:16] i'll give you the nature of certain
[56:18] animals
[56:23] anything that is similar to us
[56:26] some coincidence right no no no no
[56:33] [Music]
[56:56] brown says
[57:03] hebrews chapter 7.
[57:07] as i said this morning preaching 57 el
[57:09] cuervo si alguna
[57:13] the old crow if there ever was a
[57:15] hypocrite it's the crow correct
[57:20] that's right him and the dove sat on the
[57:21] same part
[57:23] oh very similar
[57:25] both of them fly
[57:28] land they both fly
[57:30] they're both the empires
[57:36] and the doves and they both sat in the
[57:38] same arc
[57:41] set in the same roost
[57:46] and the old crow was satisfied when he
[57:48] was turned in
[57:54] get out of that church that he could go
[57:56] out there and sit on one of those old
[57:57] dead carcasses
[58:01] this crowd likes the things that are
[58:03] rotten
[58:05] he's fed off of this
[58:35] as much right to set on a dead animal as
[58:37] a crow did
[58:40] but it was two different natures
[58:43] the nature of the dove
[58:47] says
[59:30] just has a dove
[59:36] service is finished
[59:39] and he goes to eat things that are
[59:41] rotten
[59:43] because that's in his
[59:44] nature of the crow
[59:47] aura
[59:50] now there's also a nature
[59:53] that is a bit dirty yes
[59:56] and that's the nature
[1:00:13] at kaddish barney it says so it doesn't
[1:00:15] mean that you have to have a measuring
[1:00:16] stick in your church
[1:00:20] don't have a measuring stick here for
[1:00:21] those who behave bad
[1:00:26] if you do this if you if you measure up
[1:00:28] to these rules
[1:00:33] to that rule many times
[1:00:39] many times people will lay aside little
[1:00:41] things like that
[1:00:45] you belong to a church
[1:00:49] and the thing is still in their hearts
[1:00:53] there hasn't been a change in their
[1:00:55] hearts
[1:00:57] needed of a change in nature
[1:01:02] the thing is still in their hearts
[1:01:06] and they slip around and do it
[1:01:14] when a man has met god's requirement and
[1:01:15] been born again of the spirit of god
[1:01:20] those things are took out of his life
[1:01:28] he says could you imagine a pig
[1:01:34] a pig will go to the powell of manure no
[1:01:36] look
[1:02:04] as long
[1:02:17] to begin with
[1:02:32] he needed a change or he needs a change
[1:02:34] in his life
[1:02:37] and there is a change in his life
[1:02:41] but there has to be a change in our
[1:02:43] lives
[1:02:46] now the nature of the crow of the lamb
[1:02:50] el corderito the lamb
[1:02:56] is a very very innocent being
[1:02:59] and very pure
[1:03:28] where to go
[1:03:41] because our nature really hasn't been
[1:03:43] changed
[1:03:46] because a lamb gives up all of his
[1:03:48] rights
[1:03:50] he doesn't depend on himself depends
[1:03:53] it depends on somebody else
[1:04:23] the goats are good to jump quick
[1:04:26] here or there this is not going no any
[1:04:29] they
[1:04:29] they say something and no no
[1:04:31] no no it's not this way no no
[1:04:34] the other way
[1:04:36] things should be done like this
[1:05:19] the indian that he had a dream of that
[1:05:21] told brother branham
[1:05:23] he said brother branham
[1:05:25] i had a dream
[1:05:27] and i dreamed of two dogs
[1:05:30] one was white and one was black
[1:05:33] now we're fighting
[1:06:16] who wins in this battle
[1:06:18] the indian said
[1:06:20] oh the one i feed the most
[1:06:25] feeding the most brethren estamos
[1:06:28] are we feeding the most
[1:06:57] he won't even fit in the suit
[1:07:24] you're making the other ones skinnier

[1:09:01] you take in doing your decisions
[1:09:03] [Music]
[1:09:09] [Music]
[1:09:18] i grew up
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:10:00] or
[1:10:55] of this eagle's nest
[1:11:00] and put it there where the chickens were
[1:11:06] this eagle thought it was a chicken
[1:11:09] you would look at the rest i said
[1:11:11] [Music]
[1:11:16] but he didn't know anything else
