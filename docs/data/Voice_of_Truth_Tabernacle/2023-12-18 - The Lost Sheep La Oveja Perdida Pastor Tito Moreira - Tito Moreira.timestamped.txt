[22:29] there's brother margarito and his
[22:31] daughter God bless
[22:35] him everyone is
[22:37] welcome says like
[22:48] this then Drew near unto him all the
[22:51] publicans and sinners for to hear
[22:56] him
[23:03] and the Pharisees and scribes murmured
[23:05] saying this man receiveth Sinners and
[23:07] eateth with
[23:11] them he spoke unto them this par unto
[23:14] them
[23:26] saying what man of you having 100 sheep
[23:28] if he lose one of them does not leave
[23:30] the 90 and nine in the wilderness and go
[23:32] after that which is lost until he find
[23:38] it and when he had found it he layth it
[23:40] on his shoulders
[23:49] rejoicing and when he cometh home he
[23:52] called it together his friend and
[23:53] neighbor saying unto them Rejoice with
[23:55] me for I have found my sheep which was
[23:56] lost
[24:07] I say unto you that likewise Joy shall
[24:10] be in heaven over one sinner that
[24:11] repenteth more than over 90 and N just
[24:14] persons which need no
[24:17] repentance we'll be speaking with the
[24:19] thought the lost sheep let us pray Lord
[24:24] Jesus we want your
[24:26] guidance as we speak your
[24:30] word you working in every
[24:32] heart and give us what we
[24:36] need we ask this in the precious name of
[24:38] the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may
[24:41] be
[24:50] seated I like the first verse of this
[24:54] chapter because it
[24:56] says
[25:01] says that all the the the publicans and
[25:03] sinners Drew near unto him to hear
[25:10] him generally the the publicans were
[25:13] looked at as evil people in in in in
[25:18] Israel and and the Sinners
[25:22] likewise but I like how the Bible says I
[25:25] love love how the Bible says I love how
[25:28] the Bible
[25:30] says that these
[25:33] publicans and these
[25:37] Sinners they sought out to hear the Lord
[25:39] Jesus
[25:41] Christ I ask myself how many
[25:45] Sinners want to be around
[25:49] us I ask how many people out
[25:53] there want to have fellowship with
[25:56] us do they want to hear us do they want
[26:00] to hear
[26:02] you could it be that we are so distanced
[26:05] many
[26:05] times so
[26:09] religious that the Sinners don't want to
[26:12] hear
[26:13] us because what we
[26:16] speak it distance them uh from
[26:21] us but with Jesus it was not
[26:26] so Sinners and the publicans wanted to
[26:28] hear
[26:29] Jesus on one
[26:32] occasion uh a man or a young person
[26:39] said that he came from a far off to hear
[26:42] the the Evangelist Dwight
[26:46] Moody it was when uh Moody would give
[26:49] Sunday
[26:49] schools and they asked
[26:54] him why do you go so far for a Sunday
[26:56] School
[26:59] when you have a closer church
[27:01] here why do you travel so
[27:04] far he said I go to hear a
[27:09] moody because there they love people
[27:11] like
[27:15] me that's what the Lord Jesus Christ
[27:18] had he had
[27:20] something that would catch their
[27:24] attention not only of those that had 20
[27:27] years in the
[27:29] or 20 years in
[27:30] church but he drew the
[27:33] attention of the simple people of the
[27:38] sinful of the people that were headed
[27:39] down path they wanted they wanted to
[27:42] hear
[27:43] Jesus because they
[27:45] knew because they were loved
[27:48] there they they they were wanted
[27:51] there perhaps they wouldn't go to the
[27:55] synagogue or perhaps not even to the
[27:58] Temple but they knew that
[28:01] Jesus they knew that Jesus loved
[28:04] them Jesus was interested for
[28:07] them wanted to help
[28:13] them that's why I love that
[28:17] verse they drew near to
[28:23] Jesus all the publicans and sinners to
[28:25] hear him
[28:28] nobody forced
[28:31] them nobody had to tell them go ahead
[28:33] and
[28:35] go they desired to hear the Lord Jesus
[28:40] Christ but verse two
[28:42] says and the
[28:47] Pharisees we know that the Pharisees
[28:49] were the great religious people that
[28:52] day those that had been in the message
[28:54] for so many
[28:56] years
[28:58] but had not learned to love the
[29:02] Sinners they had not learned how to love
[29:04] the lost
[29:06] sheep and the Pharisees and the scribes
[29:09] murmured
[29:11] saying this man receive this man
[29:14] receiveth Sinners and he eateth with
[29:16] them oh
[29:19] Brothers I ask myself if we're not like
[29:22] that we don't say what's that brother
[29:24] doing with that
[29:26] person doing with that
[29:28] person does he not know what that he's
[29:31] he's he's
[29:33] wrong why does he hang out with
[29:37] them I ask myself if we don't make that
[29:39] kind of criticism many
[29:43] times we don't say well why hang out
[29:45] with that
[29:47] person he's he's in the wrong
[29:50] path he he is he is
[29:53] completely he's doing many bad
[29:56] things why do they hang out with them
[29:59] they are the
[30:04] worst that's what the Pharisees would
[30:09] murmur so Jesus wanted to teach them a
[30:13] lesson these to these
[30:16] Pharisees and us as
[30:20] well that we would be
[30:22] interested for the
[30:26] sinners for the people that that are
[30:31] astray for the people that are in
[30:34] sin and he gives them three
[30:38] Parables he gives to them one after the
[30:43] other Parables
[30:44] three Parable to teach
[30:48] them first he speaks to them on the lost
[30:54] sheep then he speaks to them on the Lost
[30:57] a coin of a
[31:04] woman that had 10 coins on her
[31:09] headband it was it was like an
[31:11] engagement ring for the
[31:13] woman and it says that she lost
[31:17] one and she turned the light she turned
[31:19] on the
[31:21] candle and she she looked for it until
[31:24] she found
[31:25] it then gives him the
[31:29] story of the prodal
[31:33] son yes the prodical
[31:36] son he gives him three
[31:38] stories the lost
[31:40] sheep the the Lost
[31:43] coin and then the prodical son lost yes
[31:47] the lost
[31:52] son and he teaches them through this
[31:55] stor these stories
[31:58] there is something
[32:00] special about someone that is
[32:05] lost and should receive special
[32:10] treatment and that will produce a
[32:12] special
[32:15] Joy I ask myself if there's not any Joy
[32:17] amongst
[32:20] us because we don't know what it's
[32:24] like what it's like to help someone
[32:26] that's lost
[32:30] that's if there's not any Joy among
[32:33] us we only focused on
[32:36] ourselves and not
[32:39] focus helping
[32:41] somebody somebody that
[32:43] is somebody that is a straight or
[32:48] lost there is a joy in
[32:52] Salvation there is a joy in
[32:55] Salvation it doesn't have to be
[32:59] NE you can Rejoice for the Salvation of
[33:01] your brother of your sister Son Of The
[33:04] Lost of The Sinner of the most evil
[33:11] person that's
[33:15] what because the three stories end with
[33:18] a with a par with a feast and
[33:24] joy now we'll speak a little bit on what
[33:26] it is to be lost I'm being
[33:29] lost what does it mean to be
[33:32] lost being
[33:34] lost it
[33:36] means that you are out of
[33:40] place you are out of your
[33:44] position or you don't know where you
[33:46] find
[33:47] yourself and don't know where to
[33:51] go what a terrible thing it is to be
[33:55] lost
[33:58] what a terrible thing it feels like to
[34:00] not go know where to
[34:02] go when you're out of your
[34:05] place out of where you
[34:08] belong the children of
[34:10] God they belong to God's
[34:14] family the of God Belong With
[34:18] God a sheep belongs
[34:22] with a sheep belongs with her
[34:24] she a sheep belongs with her
[34:27] [Applause]
[34:29] flock coin belongs to the
[34:33] headband belong on the ground
[34:36] lost it should be on the
[34:39] headband being in
[34:41] display for what it
[34:43] is for what it was made
[34:45] for I ask you brother and
[34:48] sister what were you made for are you in
[34:51] your
[34:53] place you could be in church and be
[34:55] lost be in church and be
[34:59] lost you are not in your
[35:01] position you're not where you should
[35:04] [Applause]
[35:08] be how sad it is to be
[35:13] lost we speak a lot on Psalms
[35:17] 23 he says the Lord is my
[35:19] shepherd I shall not
[35:24] want how beautiful it is to know that we
[35:26] have a shepherd
[35:29] how many here have a
[35:36] shepherd He make me lie to lie down in
[35:39] Green
[35:44] Pastures he leadth me beside the Still
[35:47] Waters he restoreth my
[35:51] soul he leaded me in the path of
[35:54] righteousness for his name's sake
[36:00] yeah though I walk through the valley of
[36:01] the shadow of death I will fear no
[36:03] evil for thou are with
[36:06] me th Ro and th staff they Comfort
[36:11] Me Now prepares the table before
[36:15] me in the presence of my
[36:18] enemies th unes my head with
[36:21] oil my cup runneth
[36:24] over that is when you have a
[36:29] that is when you're being guided
[36:32] or that is when you are in your
[36:35] place that is when you are not
[36:39] lost but what about when you are
[36:43] lost now we love to speak on Psalms
[36:46] 23 say oh the Lord is my sheer I shall
[36:50] not
[36:51] want but what
[36:53] happens when that sheep is
[36:55] lost
[36:58] what happens when it's not with his
[37:02] Shepherd what happens when it's not
[37:03] being guided or
[37:09] LED how sad how
[37:15] scary to
[37:22] say yet though I walk through the valley
[37:24] of the shadow of death when I walk I
[37:26] walk through the your shadow of
[37:30] death I have no one to help
[37:36] me I don't have the comfort that I
[37:40] need could you imagine a
[37:42] sheep
[37:47] alone going through the valley of the
[37:49] shadow of
[37:51] death could you
[37:55] imagine her simply being
[37:58] lost the she not knowing what to
[38:02] do they she can't
[38:04] say he will Comfort my
[38:07] soul he will guide me through the
[38:10] path because there's no one
[38:13] guiding she's lost her
[38:15] guide the Sheep has lost her
[38:18] Direction has lost her
[38:20] family has lost the
[38:24] Comfort the Sheep can't say he'll
[38:25] Comfort my my
[38:31] soul what about when you're going
[38:33] through that
[38:35] moment the worst moment of their
[38:38] life the lowest of valleys of their
[38:42] life the
[38:45] lowest the most profound
[38:48] pain the greatest attack of the
[38:53] enemy and the shepherd isn't there
[38:58] oh let me tell
[39:01] you one occasion Jesus had to know what
[39:04] that felt
[39:06] like but it was like to walk alone the
[39:09] Bible
[39:10] says that
[39:16] inane sweat drops of
[39:19] blood to
[39:21] feel he began to get
[39:24] anxious because his father
[39:28] was going to separate from him for a
[39:31] moment he was going to go have to go
[39:34] through that
[39:34] Valley as a man not as God but as a
[39:40] man he going to have to go through that
[39:44] Valley the father having left his great
[39:52] Shepherd and him on the
[39:55] cross he he he he cried
[39:58] out he said father
[40:02] father why hast Thou forsaken
[40:13] me how sad it is to see a lost
[40:17] sheep the Sheep can't
[40:21] say you will prepare my table the table
[40:24] before
[40:25] me
[40:27] because perhaps the Sheep doesn't know
[40:29] what to
[40:32] eat the Sheep doesn't know where the
[40:33] food
[40:37] is the Sheep doesn't know what to feed
[40:41] of someone something could poison
[40:47] it something could make it
[40:54] sick now I don't want to be a a lost
[40:59] sheep I don't want to be someone that's
[41:02] lost I don't know about you
[41:05] brother but I want somebody to guide
[41:08] me I don't want to
[41:11] be and the circumstances of his life
[41:15] through the
[41:16] problems through the
[41:18] difficulties the enemy is
[41:20] real Sin is
[41:23] real hell is
[41:25] real
[41:27] the danger is
[41:28] real the wolf is
[41:31] real the Predator is
[41:35] real the Bible says the devil is as a
[41:37] roaring
[41:38] lion seeking whom he may
[41:41] devour he is real the devil is
[41:45] real I don't want to be
[41:48] alone I want a
[41:50] guide I want the holy ghost in my heart
[41:55] guiding my life
[41:58] because without him I'm
[42:04] lost without him I'm
[42:09] lost if the Holy Ghost is not guiding
[42:11] your
[42:14] life there is no Shepherd
[42:19] [Applause]
[42:22] there Jesus Christ said I will give you
[42:24] the Holy Ghost
[42:26] and he will guide
[42:29] you into all trth that's what we need
[42:33] Brothers to make
[42:36] sure we have someone guid Our
[42:41] Lives should be the presence of Person
[42:43] of the Holy
[42:44] Ghost are you being
[42:47] guided or are you one of the lost
[42:55] sheep
[42:59] who's guiding your
[43:04] life first Peter
[43:10] says first Peter 2 ver2 says for you
[43:13] were as sheep going
[43:19] astray but are now returned unto the
[43:21] shepherd and Bishop of your
[43:24] souls I make than you the
[43:27] invitation to each and every one of
[43:29] you that you would return to the
[43:33] sheer Bishop of your
[43:37] souls that you would allow God to guide
[43:39] your
[43:45] life now I ask
[43:48] myself why was the Sheep
[43:53] lost what caused it to be lost
[43:57] why did it
[44:00] stay now God gives three examples Jesus
[44:04] gives him three
[44:06] examples first one was of the lost
[44:09] sheep the second one was the Lost
[44:12] coin and the third one was the lost
[44:21] son one was lost because of of being
[44:25] through being foolish
[44:27] the the Sheep
[44:32] perhaps the the the coin was lost
[44:35] through
[44:42] carelessness and the third one the lost
[44:44] son was lost
[44:47] willfully he
[44:49] rebelled that's why in the first two
[44:52] Parables that you seek that which was
[44:55] lost
[44:57] but when someone goes
[45:00] willfully the father is waiting for him
[45:02] to
[45:05] return but why was he
[45:10] lost I could think of many reasons why a
[45:12] person is
[45:13] lost someone could get
[45:18] sick and they simply can't
[45:21] Advance something's happening with
[45:24] them someone could be attacked
[45:28] a sheep could be
[45:29] attacked we are
[45:33] attacked if we are not
[45:36] careful we will be uh bitten by
[45:40] Satan perhaps the people out there that
[45:43] have been
[45:45] attacked maybe even the Christians have
[45:48] attacked maybe even the Pharisees have
[45:50] attacked
[45:53] them sometimes the worst attacks come
[45:55] from within
[46:01] people that say they're
[46:04] Christian but just simply like to
[46:08] attack it somehow it makes them feel
[46:10] better that others are in a worse
[46:16] condition maybe that helps them not see
[46:18] their
[46:20] flaws when they see the laws of
[46:24] others
[46:29] it could have been that that sheep was
[46:32] attacked it could have been that simply
[46:34] she was
[46:37] careless simply didn't pay
[46:43] attention they
[46:44] say Charles spon
[46:47] said evangelist Charles Spurgeon he
[46:51] said when a sheep is is bleeding ble
[46:55] bleeds
[46:58] yes he
[47:02] says they they lose uh their
[47:06] food because she can't
[47:09] eat and and and and and bleed at the
[47:12] same
[47:16] time many because of so much complaining
[47:19] many
[47:22] times we don't realize that we're
[47:24] losing
[47:26] we're losing God's
[47:28] bless we're losing what he wants to give
[47:30] us we're the food for our
[47:34] lives and we become
[47:37] weak we're not
[47:40] eating because we are
[47:44] complaining we are
[47:48] crying can't bleed and eat at the same
[47:52] time or she bleeds or eats
[48:03] we are many that's why we many we
[48:06] because instead of eating we are
[48:07] bleeding we are crying we're
[48:09] complaining we're
[48:12] criticizing we're losing our lives our
[48:19] food we become
[48:22] careless become careless with about what
[48:25] God wants to give us
[48:29] perhaps we
[48:32] stumble many people get lost in in the
[48:35] mountains and places like
[48:38] that it's because they haven't they
[48:40] didn't look where they were
[48:42] stepping they didn't watch where they
[48:43] were stepping and they
[48:44] stumbled and they became
[48:47] hurt and they got
[48:50] lost because they fell too far
[48:54] out people are looking for
[48:58] them because they're wounded in a
[49:00] certain
[49:02] place and they
[49:10] fell and how dangerous and scary it it
[49:14] ought to be or it
[49:16] is because when something is
[49:22] lost you have no Assurance of being able
[49:24] to find it again
[49:27] it could be possible that it could be
[49:29] lost
[49:34] forever that you've lost and you've
[49:36] never been able to find
[49:40] again you
[49:43] remember I never found that certain
[49:45] thing again do you know where it ended
[49:48] up to know what happened with
[49:51] it I remember I left it
[49:54] here
[50:01] the other day I was looking for a title
[50:02] of vehicle that I
[50:04] have that I just uh gave
[50:08] away and I can't find
[50:10] it I looked all
[50:13] over I thought it was in a certain place
[50:16] and I can't find
[50:21] it if something is lost there's no
[50:23] assurance that you're going to be able
[50:24] to find it again are you with me
[50:27] brothers that's
[50:29] scary someone is lost there's no
[50:32] guarantee could be there and it died
[50:37] there nobody will find
[50:41] it that's
[50:48] scary but I like what brother brandham
[50:51] says here in uh letting off the pressure
[50:57] he says there are two types of people in
[50:58] this days let me say
[51:02] this men and women in the world today
[51:09] brother that really don't want to do
[51:10] these things they're
[51:13] doing there are men in the and women in
[51:15] the world today that don't want to
[51:18] sin I feel sorry for
[51:20] them they don't want to do anything
[51:22] wrong but they do it
[51:26] drove to
[51:29] it there's a place for that
[51:31] person that wants to do
[51:35] right there's a place to let off that
[51:39] pressure it's
[51:43] true but there are some that don't
[51:46] care not all
[51:49] Sinners wants to continue
[51:52] s not all the one that's
[51:54] backsliding wants to be
[51:56] back majority
[51:59] of are trying to find their way
[52:03] back majority of don't want to be in
[52:05] that
[52:07] place brother how many could say Amen to
[52:09] that how many could say I've
[52:13] sinned I have not
[52:15] wanted I have
[52:16] failed I haven't wanted to
[52:24] fail
[52:25] no wonder it's so important to
[52:30] Jesus there is a special
[52:32] treatment brother
[52:34] says he leaves the
[52:38] 99 with the other Shepherds that are
[52:41] helping
[52:42] him he go and seeks that one which was
[52:50] lost because perhaps it didn't want to
[52:52] be
[52:54] lost perhaps that wasn't his
[52:58] desire perhaps the devil perhaps
[53:01] deceived
[53:05] it and he gives a more special
[53:09] treatment a more special
[53:12] attention to the one that is
[53:14] lost than to the soul is
[53:18] lost then to the other 99 that are with
[53:24] the myself do we have the same desire
[53:26] that Jesus do we have that same
[53:29] desire to seek that lost
[53:35] soul to to seek that person that's not
[53:38] Desiring to live the way they're
[53:41] living some sick out
[53:44] there someone lost out
[53:48] there to take them as your
[53:52] responsibility Jesus tells this to the
[53:54] Pharisees
[53:56] just which one of
[53:58] us in other words you take the
[54:04] responsibility a lost phone than a lost
[54:10] soul when you know there's somebody in
[54:13] need why don't you worry for
[54:17] them why don't you take that
[54:22] responsibility why you say if it matters
[54:24] to God should matter to
[54:28] me brother Bram says in the message
[54:30] images of
[54:33] Christ he
[54:36] says if I had a a a a a lesson to
[54:41] give I want to be like he
[54:46] was he came to be a
[54:49] shepherd and he was a
[54:53] shepher sheer someone that goes to seek
[54:56] their
[54:58] sheep you don't have to have the office
[55:00] of a
[55:02] pastor but you have to have the office
[55:04] of a
[55:07] Shepherd you don't have to have the
[55:09] office of a
[55:10] Shepherd but you can have the heart of a
[55:20] Shepherd even go the Lord tells Peter if
[55:24] Peter if you love me
[55:25] if you love
[55:27] me what if Jesus would have would ask
[55:29] you that if you love me if you love
[55:34] me Tabernacle voice do you love God you
[55:39] love the Lord
[55:41] Jesus then care for my
[55:44] sheep take care of my
[55:46] sheep take care of my children brother
[55:51] says I would rather have someone do good
[55:54] to my children
[55:57] then do it to
[55:58] me that's how our heavenly father
[56:01] is Father you have you do it for them
[56:05] then to do it for
[56:09] me brother BR continue
[56:11] saying there's a famous
[56:14] picture I don't know if it's here I
[56:16] don't
[56:18] think but I have it in the room and I
[56:20] always look at
[56:23] it I can't remember of the a painter's
[56:28] name but when he seeks that black
[56:31] that he loses it and seeks it out and
[56:35] goes and seeks it what is he
[56:37] doing he goes through the
[56:41] Wilderness he's also scratched
[56:44] up he goes through
[56:47] dangers he seeks all
[56:50] night until
[56:53] finally at at the end of a of a of a
[56:57] cliff
[57:00] there hanging off a
[57:04] bush seeking his own
[57:07] life he reaches
[57:12] out brings that little animal out of its
[57:16] condition and he brings it to
[57:23] himself this say he
[57:26] says another another paint or artist
[57:29] paint painted a
[57:34] painting if it's not there I probably
[57:36] missed it to send it to you
[57:39] again say another uh another painter
[57:41] painted a
[57:43] painting of The Shepherd bringing the
[57:46] Sheep
[57:48] back it appears that the easiest
[57:53] thing would be for the shepherd to put
[57:55] that sheep around the
[57:59] the and walk it back this
[58:05] way but do you see how how the spirit
[58:08] took hold of of the the brush of the the
[58:10] AR the
[58:12] pain he didn't put it under his
[58:16] arm he put it upon his
[58:19] shoulders that's what the Book of Luke
[58:22] says he takes it upon his shoulders
[58:27] now I want you to look see the care of
[58:29] this
[58:31] Shepherd Jesus when he was casting out
[58:34] demons he said he did it with the Finger
[58:37] of
[58:38] God that's all Jesus
[58:41] needed to cast out demons was one
[58:45] finger I imagine he used the weakest of
[58:48] fingers to cast out demons it was one
[58:52] finger he
[58:53] said
[58:58] if a demon is bothering
[59:01] you all you need on behalf of God
[59:05] is something so
[59:08] insignificant but for him to just lift
[59:10] up his and cast him
[59:15] out but when it has to do with a sheep
[59:18] coming back
[59:20] home it has to do with the Sheep coming
[59:22] back
[59:23] home
[59:25] what is the strongest part of a man it's
[59:28] his
[59:29] shoulders have you
[59:31] [Applause]
[59:32] noticed how the shoulders are the the
[59:35] the biggest thing of of a
[59:38] man where can he carry the most weight
[59:42] it's on his
[59:44] shoulders and what is the most sure
[59:46] thing for for
[59:48] the be upon his
[59:52] shoulders and that's how he took that
[59:54] sheep
[59:56] put it upon his
[59:58] shoulders and
[1:00:01] lovingly walks back with it then brother
[1:00:05] says oh Brothers here he
[1:00:09] is all the powers of
[1:00:17] God give God a round of
[1:00:20] applause how much he loves
[1:00:22] us how much he loves
[1:00:25] [Music]
[1:00:28] us how much he loves
[1:00:32] us all the powers of
[1:00:36] God no wonder we don't see all God's
[1:00:42] power because we're not
[1:00:44] in in the same thoughts to say God I
[1:00:49] come to this
[1:00:51] life to seek lost souls
[1:00:55] that's part of our commission yes or yes
[1:00:58] brother the commission that God gave his
[1:01:02] Apostles part of our
[1:01:04] commission go around
[1:01:07] world to Every
[1:01:10] Creature believe that is baptized shall
[1:01:12] be
[1:01:14] saved that's commission for who for who
[1:01:19] Brothers for for who not for all of them
[1:01:22] for who it's for me don't put it on
[1:01:25] everybody else put it for yourself
[1:01:28] that's my
[1:01:30] [Applause]
[1:01:33] commission say it's my
[1:01:36] commission half of half of it believe
[1:01:41] it thank God for somebody that believes
[1:01:44] that I know somebody
[1:01:46] believes that's our commission that's my
[1:01:51] commission that's why although I preach
[1:01:53] hard many times
[1:01:57] as a shepher I could to
[1:01:59] church but it's never been taken
[1:02:02] from seek someone in need and tell
[1:02:05] them there's salvation for you there's
[1:02:09] forgiveness for you there is help for
[1:02:12] you there is love for
[1:02:16] you because it's my commission it's your
[1:02:23] commission
[1:02:26] it's our
[1:02:28] commission he
[1:02:32] says all the powers of
[1:02:36] God clothing that lost
[1:02:41] thing bringing her
[1:02:45] back you
[1:02:48] say Lord why don't I see more of you I
[1:02:51] don't see I see more of your power
[1:02:55] I don't see more why don't I see more of
[1:02:56] your
[1:02:57] Miracles could it be that we it doesn't
[1:02:59] matter to us that lost sheep doesn't
[1:03:02] matter to
[1:03:05] us could it be that when he displays the
[1:03:07] most powerful thing
[1:03:09] him you don't see it when you
[1:03:12] cast you see a preacher you see
[1:03:15] Minister for for a sick
[1:03:19] person that's just only need the finger
[1:03:22] of God's only need
[1:03:25] that's all that's needed to cast out
[1:03:27] sickness to cast out
[1:03:29] demon all that's needed is
[1:03:32] is let me tell you is there more of God
[1:03:35] more of
[1:03:36] God more of God Brothers there's more
[1:03:40] power there's more power of
[1:03:43] God he would only show
[1:03:46] it when he is carrying a lost
[1:03:53] sheep all the powers of
[1:03:57] heaven will will support
[1:04:01] you you are seeking a lost
[1:04:11] sheep musicians can't come

[1:05:11] back everyone has gone his own
[1:05:15] way when you know what it's like to be
[1:05:20] lost when the Devil comes and tells
[1:05:23] you there's no forgiveness for
[1:05:26] you you've crossed that line of
[1:05:29] Mercy when the Devil comes and tells you

[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:11] like to desire God's
[1:06:16] forgiveness to beg for God's forgiveness
[1:06:19] to say
[1:06:21] God I didn't want to do it
[1:06:27] this isn't what I
[1:06:28] [Music]
[1:06:30] wanted when you
[1:06:32] [Music]
[1:06:34] know how of that profound
[1:06:41] pain say Lord I don't know if the God
[1:06:44] would forgive
[1:06:46] me I don't know if he'll receive me
[1:06:50] again when you know that
[1:06:53] pain
[1:06:54] [Music]
[1:06:58] you offer that love to
[1:07:01] others you tell
[1:07:03] them there is forgiveness for
[1:07:07] you there's life for

[1:07:38] Greater
[1:07:39] Joy there's not a
[1:07:41] joy as
[1:07:43] [Music]
[1:07:45] great like seeing lost
[1:07:50] sheep that's the
[1:07:52] joy that the Lord is is is speaking of
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:07:58] here and I will tell
[1:08:03] you as we're ending the
[1:08:07] year and we're finishing up with this
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:13] theme speaking of our purpose on this
[1:08:22] Earth Jesus is still saving
[1:08:29] souls and there are still Sinners that
[1:08:31] want to come to
[1:08:34] [Music]
[1:08:36] him there are sinners that need to hear
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:43] him if there's one thing we want to do
[1:08:45] on this
[1:08:46] [Music]
[1:08:51] Earth is to reflect the love of our
[1:08:54] Shepherd and tell
[1:08:57] them
[1:08:58] God loves
[1:09:00] you God can help
[1:09:03] you there's love for
[1:09:07] you there's a place of Refuge for
[1:09:11] you he awaits
[1:09:15] you because many times we've been like
[1:09:17] the prodical
[1:09:20] son ourselves have rebelled against God
[1:09:24] no one did anything to
[1:09:27] us but we didn't no longer wanted
[1:09:30] [Music]
[1:09:31] to follow what he was asking of
[1:09:35] us that doesn't mean that he's forgotten
[1:09:39] us but he continues waiting for
[1:09:43] us no I was learning something about
[1:09:45] that
[1:09:48] [Music]
[1:09:50] story the reason the father ran to the
[1:09:52] son when he came back he ran to embrace
[1:09:57] [Applause]
[1:09:58] him not only because he was excited to
[1:10:00] see
[1:10:01] him but the Bible
[1:10:04] says that when a son has been
[1:10:06] disobedient when he's
[1:10:08] been the book of Deuteronomy
[1:10:13] says people have a right to Stone him
[1:10:15] when he goes when he's coming
[1:10:18] back so it's very
[1:10:22] possible that the father to protect to
[1:10:25] cover
[1:10:28] him in case someone wanted to Stone him
[1:10:32] he went and clothed and protected
[1:10:34] him protected
