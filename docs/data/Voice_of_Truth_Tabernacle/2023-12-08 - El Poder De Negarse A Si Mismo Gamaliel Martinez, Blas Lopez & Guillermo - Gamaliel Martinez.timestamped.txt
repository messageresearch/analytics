[21:27] Brothers it's a pleasure to be with
[21:34] you a great greeting to our brothers and
[21:37] those that watch us through the
[21:41] internet along with my brothers we'll be
[21:44] speaking on
[21:45] [Music]
[21:48] John and we want to focus a little bit
[21:51] on John for the
[21:52] [Music]
[21:57] Youth I invite you to open your Bibles
[22:00] to the Book of Luke 1:
[22:07] 13 or the youth last
[22:13] week they spoke on and his name was John
[22:16] they tell it his name was
[22:18] John I want to continue on what they uh
[22:21] they
[22:26] spoke but I I wanted get I want to speak
[22:29] on the point where the angel spoke to
[22:30] his
[22:32] father Luke 113
[22:42] says but the angel said to him zear
[22:44] Zechariah do not be afraid for your
[22:46] prayer has been heard and your wife
[22:48] Elizabeth will bear you a son and you
[22:50] will call her name his
[22:56] name
[23:02] and you will have a joy and gladness and
[23:04] May and many Will Rejoice at his birth
[23:06] because he will be great before God he
[23:08] will not drink wine or strong drink and
[23:09] he will be filled with the Holy
[23:17] Spirit even from his mother's womb and
[23:19] he will turn many of the children of
[23:21] Israel to the Lord their
[23:23] God let us bow our heads Brothers
[23:26] blessed Heavenly Father
[23:30] we're so thankful to be a be able to be
[23:32] here before your children
[23:34] father thank you for my pastor for giv
[23:36] me the opportunity to be
[23:39] here and for you for giving me the
[23:41] thought that it would be a
[23:43] [Music]
[23:45] blessing that I would not say an
[23:47] incorrect
[23:48] word help me and my brothers help my
[23:52] interpreter I ask this in the name of
[23:54] the Lord Jesus amen
[23:56] amen you may be seated
[24:00] Brothers here in the Book of
[24:04] Luke I like what it
[24:07] said because truly
[24:11] John he had a very peculiar
[24:15] [Music]
[24:16] birth because the angel
[24:23] Gabriel he appeared before zaras when he
[24:26] was ding his doing his duties in the
[24:30] temple but we see the
[24:34] situation that Zechariah even being a a
[24:40] priest he doubted the angel
[24:45] Gabriel he said your wife will bear a
[24:48] son but he
[24:50] doubted so we see
[24:53] [Music]
[24:56] there
[24:58] that we
[25:01] could but sometimes a miracle we can't
[25:04] believe it it seems impossible in back
[25:07] in the old
[25:09] times a woman that was
[25:11] Barren that that was a a a
[25:14] curse that's why
[25:17] Elizabeth she was so
[25:19] anxious to have a
[25:26] child so we see that the Lord fulfills
[25:29] that desire for
[25:33] Zacharias but due to the circumstances
[25:35] of not
[25:36] believing the Lord Jesus makes him adult
[25:40] the the angel
[25:42] says you will be a a mute for not
[25:45] believing
[25:46] until your son is
[25:50] born so we see throughout a lapse of
[25:53] time when John is
[25:56] born we're talking about six months he
[25:59] was older than the Lord
[26:02] Jesus he is
[26:06] born I have it
[26:11] here Luke 157
[26:22] says it says when when the time came for
[26:25] Elizabeth to have her child
[26:34] and when they they see that that he was
[26:35] born and and he had and he he had become
[26:40] [Music]
[26:44] great and they rejoiced greatly with
[26:50] her so the the neighbors began to ask
[26:52] her what will the child's name
[26:55] be they said it will be will it be
[26:58] Zacharias like his
[26:59] father the mother said no his name will
[27:01] be
[27:02] John at the moment that she said her
[27:06] father
[27:07] Zachariah he he was able to
[27:12] speak so something was happening with
[27:14] that child something was going to be
[27:18] done because many things had
[27:21] happened in such a short lapse of
[27:25] time the Lord Jesus Christ Was preparing
[27:27] this child
[27:30] this child is left without
[27:33] parents because if you
[27:37] remember his mother was
[27:40] elderly and his father was as well
[27:43] right the majority of them were they
[27:46] were Elders older
[27:50] people but the historians say
[27:53] this that it was he was it was at the
[27:55] age of five his father his parents had
[27:58] passed
[27:59] away and historian
[28:04] says I was doing a little bit of
[28:06] studying and I found it in that way John
[28:09] is left without
[28:10] parents
[28:12] why because God has something prepared
[28:14] for John why does he leave without
[28:19] parents isn't that a little you would
[28:21] say it's the
[28:23] selfish of God that way couldn't it have
[28:26] been a different way
[28:30] sometimes we say as young
[28:32] people Lord why don't you answer my
[28:35] prayers why am I like
[28:37] this why can't I believe you have you
[28:40] ever asked yourself that you I asked
[28:44] myself could it be that my my prayer
[28:47] doesn't even reach the the roof of my
[28:50] house or do my prayers not go to your
[28:53] ear why do you want to leave me
[28:55] alone why can't I change
[29:00] why can't I be a better
[29:04] son why can't be why can't it be better
[29:07] at praying
[29:09] why because God
[29:13] youth I believe God is teaching
[29:15] you to to be left alone without father
[29:20] and
[29:21] mother God wants to prepare
[29:26] you my my my brethren the
[29:30] ministers say that you are the new Next
[29:33] Generation that you will be
[29:35] taking so have you asked
[29:39] yourself that you when you feel
[29:43] alone God is preparing you for
[29:46] something
[29:48] John at the age of
[29:50] nine he goes into the
[29:52] Wilderness
[29:54] Why without father and mother
[30:00] [Music]
[30:02] uh there's a very important couple in
[30:05] the life of
[30:09] John and they were they were perhaps the
[30:11] Elders of the
[30:13] church when John was
[30:17] born but they died as
[30:21] well so John at the age of nine enters
[30:23] the
[30:25] Wilderness why is that
[30:28] because God has something prepared for
[30:31] him God takes him to the Wilderness at
[30:33] the age of
[30:36] nineo said last
[30:42] Friday he had he made an example of of a
[30:45] brother Samuel
[30:46] son that is when that's when he went
[30:48] into the
[30:50] Wilderness God wanted to show John
[30:53] something
[30:56] right God he's just off the face the
[30:59] Earth for 30 years per 30 years from
[31:04] being a
[31:06] child he disappears him until the age of
[31:09] 30 so watch how
[31:13] God they said that that he
[31:17] Locus where does that food appear in the
[31:20] in the
[31:21] wilderness I asked myself where did it
[31:23] come from there was no water there
[31:25] wasn't anything where does the locust
[31:28] come from so
[31:31] God even then he takes care of his
[31:34] children
[31:36] youth if you feel
[31:39] alone if you feel like you can't
[31:42] Advance God working with you sooner or
[31:46] later you
[31:50] will but God has been working inside
[31:54] don't get
[31:55] desperate joh didn't get desperate in in
[31:58] the I imagine that
[32:01] joh when he went into the Wilderness he
[32:03] perhaps
[32:06] thought I have a childhood like the rest
[32:09] children
[32:11] playing Jalem or in
[32:16] Judea but John didn't understand
[32:19] that because God had to
[32:23] prepare God doesn't tell you his
[32:25] purposes until afterward
[32:28] because you don't understand we can't
[32:31] understand the mind of
[32:33] God John goes into the
[32:35] Wilderness he disappears for 30 years
[32:39] imagine at the age of
[32:41] 30 God preparing his
[32:45] children after 30
[32:47] years he
[32:50] appears he says a voice crying in
[32:55] Wilderness it was
[33:01] E I looked for the definition of
[33:07] echo and I I I could uh I I understood
[33:10] that it was it a voice that's that's
[33:12] resonating in that resonating
[33:16] voice he went out preaching repentance
[33:23] youth I want to speak of a repentance
[33:25] that has been spoken of
[33:28] and I believe that John didn't speak of
[33:30] that
[33:31] repentance joh spoke of a different type
[33:33] of
[33:36] repentance the meaning of
[33:42] repentance it is it is uh much more than
[33:45] than just thinking you've done
[33:48] wrong it's a change it's changing the
[33:50] way of
[33:52] thinking and in the heart that provides
[33:54] A New Perspective of God of oneself and
[33:57] of the
[33:58] world it involves turning away from sin
[34:01] and turning to God for forgiveness
[34:06] youth when John comes out of the
[34:09] Wilderness his Echo his
[34:11] voice it comes preaching
[34:15] repentance I don't come to preach uh
[34:18] repentance that when you make a
[34:20] mistake you say Lord forgive
[34:23] me no it's a different
[34:25] repentance
[34:28] changing our mentality on how we God at
[34:30] that
[34:31] time the Lord Jesus Christ he was
[34:34] already
[34:36] preaching the Pharisees and the
[34:42] Sadducees we already thinking
[34:44] differently against the Lord Jes so the
[34:47] echo of John goes out and says
[34:51] to but not repenting of your
[34:55] sins but repent of the mentality that
[34:58] they had that Jesus Christ was already
[35:00] there repenting of your
[35:03] mentality that the Lord Jesus Christ is
[35:07] here
[35:11] now in the message believest thou
[35:15] this uh preached in
[35:21] uh it
[35:23] says oh
[35:25] wow
[35:30] I can see our Master when he arrives
[35:31] with that Darkness behind
[35:33] [Music]
[35:34] him that he was an illegitimate
[35:38] son but God always sends a warning
[35:40] before
[35:41] coming he sent a man named John the
[35:44] Baptist he was a great Forerunner of
[35:46] Jesus God always sends a forerunner
[35:49] before a great
[35:50] event you realize
[35:54] youth the Lord Jesus Christ 400 years
[35:57] before sending
[36:00] John let's bring it to our time
[36:03] you the Lord Jesus Christ said Willam
[36:05] marrying
[36:08] brandham he opened everything up for
[36:13] us he's the prophet of this
[36:16] time they say that he sends a
[36:19] prophet before a great event happen so
[36:22] in this time the Lord Jesus Christ was
[36:25] going to come that's why he prepared
[36:28] John John was a important vessel in our
[36:33] time the Lord Jesus Christ sent brother
[36:37] to prepare
[36:40] us I don't know if the time May tear but
[36:44] if it
[36:45] does you will be the next
[36:48] Generation you will preach this
[36:51] message you will stand for this
[36:54] message just like our pastor stand and
[36:57] the rest of the ministry here our
[37:00] brothers you will be the next Generation
[37:02] you so the
[37:05] prophet he came in this time to prepare
[37:09] us youth to let us
[37:11] know just like John the bapti that
[37:14] something great is coming I don't know
[37:17] how much time but something great is
[37:24] coming John comes and preaches
[37:28] that Mighty
[37:30] Echo that many people
[37:33] heard
[37:36] mother everyone heard
[37:38] it and he baptized
[37:44] why because he had to
[37:50] change the the thought of how
[37:52] Christianity was
[37:55] seen
[37:57] the Lord Jesus Christ came with another
[37:59] many
[38:01] say like the Pharisees
[38:03] said that he he had
[38:07] he but Lord Jesus Christ came to bring
[38:11] Grace because the law kth
[38:15] youth the letter
[38:18] kth but if you've seen
[38:21] our he gives himself
[38:23] completely I've always
[38:25] told never stop telling
[38:28] you if I was in
[38:31] Mexico if my
[38:33] P I believe it would be another thing
[38:36] you have the privilege to have

[39:55] John
[39:57] he came prepared after after the
[39:59] Wilderness John had something
[40:02] special
[40:04] John he he he he didn't think much of
[40:08] himself go John let let go of
[40:12] everything he was going to be the next
[40:14] priest because his father was a
[40:17] priest but he rejected
[40:20] that he even rejected to say he was a
[40:24] prophet because a greater one that him
[40:26] was
[40:27] there he let go of everything he he let

[40:39] BL God bless you my

[40:52] clap a little bit nervous
[40:55] Brothers glory to God Brothers God is
[41:00] here and we're
[41:02] speaking on John the
[41:06] Baptist a man sent by God
[41:10] brother the title is the power of
[41:16] self-denial what power John
[41:19] had let go of
[41:22] himself That's What Makes a Man Great
[41:25] Brothers is getting rid of
[41:29] himself but to rid yourself of
[41:32] yourself you need the holy
[41:35] spirit because I believe brothers that
[41:38] it's very
[41:41] nice when they tell you when they
[41:43] compliment you tell you did a good
[41:46] job or you did this or the
[41:49] other the honor is for you
[41:52] Brothers it feels
[41:54] nice but when you work on on a team

[41:59] say my team that did the work on behalf
[42:03] of
[42:03] God you don't get the
[42:07] glory for our Lord Jesus
[42:11] Christ quickly just want to read the
[42:15] scripture and Luke uh 15 verse1
[42:25] 15
[42:29] for he will be for he will be great in
[42:32] the sight of the Lord and drink neither
[42:33] wine nor strong drink and he will also
[42:35] be filled with the Holy Spirit even from
[42:37] his mother's
[42:41] womb John the Baptist
[42:43] Brothers as our brother gel
[42:47] said as our Brothers pre last
[42:53] Friday we all know that he came with a
[42:55] peculiar birth
[42:57] that birth was uh it was
[43:01] unique but he was filled with the Holy
[43:06] Spirit the most tremendous like I tell
[43:08] you is the power of denying
[43:14] oneself he at the age of nine years old
[43:16] he went to the
[43:19] desert he didn't have a life like you
[43:21] and
[43:24] I what did not
[43:28] what a child desires at a young age are

[44:20] Lord he had a job
[44:22] Brothers when
[44:24] young when in your
[44:27] youth what you want is to quickly drink
[44:31] to go have fun at
[44:33] parties is to try wine
[44:37] Brothers is to say as a prophet
[44:42] [Music]
[44:44] said when he's seen that woman
[44:47] drinking this is life that's not life
[44:51] that is
[44:53] death this here is life

[59:55] house and as the scripture
[59:58] says that when you draw close to your
[1:00:01] house or
[1:00:04] come raise your hands God is
[1:00:08] here it appears as though we're in
[1:00:15] a that the
[1:00:18] people they depend on the on the
[1:00:20] preacher to
[1:00:22] motivate but when you come to his house
[1:00:25] you understand that God is here the
[1:00:28] prophet
[1:00:32] says God extends his
[1:00:34] hand into the
[1:00:39] change and there he takes out a coins
[1:00:42] that are worth
[1:00:43] dollar coins that are worth 10 cents
[1:00:46] perhaps of five
[1:00:48] cents and maybe there's a couple pennies
[1:00:50] as
[1:00:53] well and sometimes you get rid of the of
[1:00:56] the
[1:00:58] penny but uh the prophet says don't get
[1:01:00] rid of the penny because sooner or later
[1:01:04] God uses the
[1:01:05] pennies so then
[1:01:08] God he has
[1:01:11] offices he has different
[1:01:16] callings simply see that it's
[1:01:19] God soon or later God uses the
[1:01:23] scense they were
[1:01:29] needed how many cents make a dollar 100
[1:01:32] cents make a
[1:01:34] dollar there were 100
[1:01:38] lots to form an Abraham amen

[1:01:51] cent and you be the best one cent that
[1:01:53] the best penny you can
[1:01:56] be every Son of God is predestined
[1:01:59] amen we can read the
[1:02:03] scripture there in
[1:02:07] John chapter 1 verse
[1:02:13] 6 every Son of
[1:02:16] God predestined for a good
[1:02:23] work had been announced by the prophet
[1:02:26] Isaiah to do a good
[1:02:28] work and here
[1:02:30] was being the
[1:02:32] manifestation of the
[1:02:37] word that John was the Living
[1:02:45] Word John was the word that had been
[1:02:50] expressed and he was a man of the moment
[1:02:55] he was God on the
[1:02:57] scene through a man amen
[1:03:01] amen how many believe it
[1:03:09] Brothers there was a man sent from God
[1:03:12] whose name was John who sent
[1:03:15] him God sent
[1:03:17] him and his name
[1:03:20] was can can you help me preach tonight
[1:03:24] his name was
[1:03:27] John this saying came for a
[1:03:33] witness to Bear witness of the
[1:03:38] light there was John here being
[1:03:41] manifest to give a witness a testimony
[1:03:45] of the
[1:03:47] light or that John was an
[1:03:50] ambassador he was a
[1:03:53] representative
[1:03:55] he was God on the
[1:03:56] scene there was
[1:03:59] John being the
[1:04:02] light of the
[1:04:04] moment he was not the
[1:04:07] light but he was bearing witness of the
[1:04:11] light do you understand
[1:04:17] me that all men through him might
[1:04:21] believe it's tremendous how it is that
[1:04:25] John is there with a
[1:04:29] purpose so that the people could see the
[1:04:33] light but he has a
[1:04:35] responsibility upon
[1:04:38] him to reflect that
[1:04:40] light so that the people might believe
[1:04:44] in him the
[1:04:46] light through
[1:04:48] John amen
[1:04:53] amen he was not the
[1:04:58] light that he might come and bear
[1:05:00] witness of the light amen
[1:05:03] Amen brother Bram
[1:05:06] says that the bride the groom left but
[1:05:10] the bride is here she
[1:05:15] is that which is reflecting the
[1:05:18] sunlight he is the
[1:05:20] Sun but we
[1:05:22] reflect that
[1:05:25] that he
[1:05:28] is what a tremendous responsibility has
[1:05:30] fallen on
[1:05:31] these because it says that the times are
[1:05:34] dark that we live in the in the worst
[1:05:37] age and we
[1:05:42] say that those that are
[1:05:46] resting they cannot be
[1:05:48] perfect but they are
[1:05:51] waiting on
[1:05:53] us
[1:05:55] see the youth
[1:05:57] nowadays and I say
[1:05:59] Lord if I was
[1:06:02] Paul I waiting on the Youth of today I
[1:06:06] would be crying in my tomb in the grave
[1:06:09] and saying
[1:06:11] Lord Lord please raise up the
[1:06:14] youth they are the future of this
[1:06:18] message they are responsible to live the
[1:06:22] life they are
[1:06:24] responsible to project the light they
[1:06:28] aren't the
[1:06:30] light but the light will be
[1:06:33] projected amongst through these
[1:06:36] youth what a
[1:06:39] responsibility the times are
[1:06:44] dark what has befallen you
[1:06:46] you
[1:06:49] us and I wanted to preach hard to the
[1:06:52] youth I wanted to a preach
[1:06:55] hard but I was
[1:06:57] meditating and the Holy Spirit came down
[1:07:00] he came down into my
[1:07:02] heart and he told me
[1:07:05] remember he said
[1:07:08] remember that is not all the
[1:07:11] message don't hit the youth he told me
[1:07:16] he said the prophet
[1:07:18] said is not delinquency child
[1:07:22] delinquency he said I said Lord it's
[1:07:26] true there is not a delinquency in the
[1:07:30] youth but he said it's parent
[1:07:33] delinquency and if your son or your
[1:07:36] daughter is in the condition they're in
[1:07:39] it's your fault
[1:07:40] parents because you haven't
[1:07:43] stood you haven't lived a
[1:07:47] life you haven't shown the
[1:07:49] way and that's why the
[1:07:52] youth today can't receive
[1:07:56] anything you can see a a youth that's
[1:08:00] struggling and you tell your
[1:08:02] son pray
[1:08:05] son but stop telling your son to
[1:08:09] pray show him how to work
[1:08:13] Brothers don't tell him to read your
[1:08:16] Bible
[1:08:18] son but show him how to read the
[1:08:21] Bible it's time to stand as
[1:08:27] parents we are
[1:08:29] responsible to bring that to our
[1:08:32] children and that is what God told
[1:08:35] me and I wanted to share
[1:08:38] that there is not
[1:08:40] delinquency of Youth
[1:08:43] of
[1:08:45] child who will show your
[1:08:48] child I will show my
[1:08:52] children
[1:08:54] how a Christian ought to
[1:08:58] be sometimes we attack Our
[1:09:01] Youth and we judge
[1:09:04] them and we we uh exceed on
[1:09:10] them but we are the responsible
[1:09:14] ones to live the
[1:09:18] higher the higher form of life highest
[1:09:20] form of life is in this message there's
[1:09:22] not a higher life than this
[1:09:27] John was the light of
[1:09:30] the he was responsible for reflecting
[1:09:32] that
[1:09:39] light brother brandom says in the
[1:09:40] message the word
[1:09:43] God calls for a total separation from
[1:09:49] unbelief the prophet says
[1:09:52] now if God
[1:09:54] said let there be
[1:09:57] light and there was no
[1:10:05] light then that wasn't God that said it
[1:10:09] amen
[1:10:11] amen When God says
[1:10:16] anything must back up what he
[1:10:19] says how many believe
[1:10:22] it
[1:10:26] when the word of God has been
[1:10:33] Vindicated the word been
[1:10:37] Vindicated that is the
[1:10:40] light
[1:10:42] now the word
[1:10:46] itself is
[1:10:51] light until it's a Vindicated
[1:10:55] light so it doesn't matter how much is
[1:11:00] spoken it doesn't matter how much is
[1:11:04] expressed that one day John would
[1:11:08] come but it hadn't happened
[1:11:11] yet or that light had not yet been
[1:11:14] reflected until the moment that John was
[1:11:20] born was indication of what God had
[1:11:23] spoken way back
[1:11:25] when there was a
[1:11:28] prophet there was the word
[1:11:31] expressed being
[1:11:33] manifested in the appointed
[1:11:37] time and there was John amen John's age
[1:11:42] John's
[1:11:45] age it can be spoken for a lot of time
[1:11:48] the word of God can but it has to come
[1:11:50] the point of its
[1:11:52] manifestation and the prophet
[1:11:55] says that that there is the light the
[1:12:00] light because if God said let there be
[1:12:03] [Music]
[1:12:04] light he waited for the light and there
[1:12:06] was no
[1:12:07] light brother then God didn't
[1:12:11] speak because when God
[1:12:14] speaks because when God
[1:12:18] speaks things come to
[1:12:20] existence because he spoken
[1:12:24] God prophesied that John would come and
[1:12:27] there was
[1:12:28] John very witness of the light
[1:12:32] he was the word
[1:12:35] expressed say Oh Glory to God Brothers
[1:12:39] how beautiful how precious it is
[1:12:43] that he came to become that a word
[1:12:47] expressed that light in the
[1:12:50] darkness preaching
[1:12:52] repentance but let me tell
[1:12:55] you the the scripture
[1:12:59] says that among those born of a
[1:13:03] woman ju
[1:13:06] John has been the greatest of them all
[1:13:10] amen
[1:13:14] amen there was none greater than John of
[1:13:16] those born of a
[1:13:17] woman how tremendous
[1:13:20] John the word expressed
[1:13:24] the prophet of the
[1:13:27] moment but the scripture
[1:13:32] says that those of the the children of
[1:13:35] the
[1:13:35] kingdom of the childrens of the
[1:13:38] Kingdom the
[1:13:41] smallest is greater than John
[1:13:45] no you didn't you didn't you didn't
[1:13:47] catch
[1:13:48] it you see that's why the prophet
[1:13:51] says that the day that the
[1:13:55] bride the day that the bride that she
[1:13:57] knows who she
[1:14:00] is many times we don't know who we
[1:14:04] are but a a a son of of the Kingdom a a
[1:14:08] child of
[1:14:10] God born
[1:14:13] again by the Holy
[1:14:16] Spirit are filled with the holy
[1:14:19] spirit that has been born of the spirit
[1:14:23] he's greater than
[1:14:29] John do you believe it
[1:14:33] brother of those of a woman there's been
[1:14:36] none greater than
[1:14:38] John but of those who've been
[1:14:42] born in the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus
[1:14:45] Christ they're greater than
[1:14:48] John why
[1:14:50] brothers because those are your rights
[1:14:55] for him to die on the cross of Calvary
[1:14:58] he gave us those rights to be children
[1:15:02] to be
[1:15:04] Sons how many rights do we
[1:15:08] have
[1:15:09] you you live
[1:15:12] under every right that God has given
[1:15:17] us but a
[1:15:19] son
[1:15:21] born of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:25] he's greater than
[1:15:28] John and God thought of
[1:15:32] us because the
[1:15:35] scripture and if you don't believe
[1:15:39] me you said well the scripture point
[1:15:41] that pointed at John that John would
[1:15:45] come the prophet prophesy that he would
[1:15:50] come can I read the scripture that he he
[1:15:53] prophesied of
[1:15:58] me I read to you the
[1:16:01] scripture that speaks of
[1:16:07] me let's go to Ephesians
[1:16:12] 13 Ephesians 1

[1:36:23] did he made his
[1:36:26] decision when he didn't
[1:36:29] go I'm a witness of
[1:36:33] that and one can allow for God to come
[1:36:36] into his

[1:36:39] one it's not
[1:36:43] yourself it's God doing it for

[1:42:49] from John
[1:42:53] is that there's nothing greater than
[1:42:54] serving
[1:42:56] God there's nothing greater than serving
[1:43:02] God he gave his whole life for the
[1:43:04] service of
[1:43:06] God even if God only used him for a
[1:43:09] couple
[1:43:11] months his whole life he was preparing
[1:43:15] himself his whole life he was
[1:43:18] preparing so God could use him a couple
[1:43:21] months
[1:43:22] hallelujah what does that let us
[1:43:25] [Music]
[1:43:26] know there's nothing greater than being
[1:43:28] used by
[1:43:30] God has to prepare us our whole
[1:43:34] life prepare our whole
[1:43:38] life God needs to prepare our whole
[1:43:42] life to use us just a few
[1:43:45] months our life was worth it our life
[1:43:49] was worth it
[1:43:51] to serve
[1:43:57] God know
[1:44:00] John it doesn't register that God talked
[1:44:03] to
[1:44:07] John until he saw the
[1:44:12] dove God spoke to the father of
[1:44:15] John he didn't even speak to
[1:44:19] John John had to
[1:44:22] believe what his father told
[1:44:27] him was Zachariah and Elizabeth told to
[1:44:31] John had such a great
[1:44:34] impact that he dedicated his whole life
[1:44:38] to prepare
[1:44:40] himself for what God wanted to do with
[1:44:44] him there's nothing
[1:44:49] greater than being used used by
[1:44:54] God I put I start to
[1:44:59] think I'm thinking when John was in jail
[1:45:01] or in
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:09] prison and he sends his
[1:45:12] disciples to ask the Lord Jesus
[1:45:16] Christ are
[1:45:19] you or are we waiting for another
[1:45:21] one
[1:45:23] ju John the
[1:45:28] Baptist send his two
[1:45:32] disciples to ask
[1:45:34] him
[1:45:36] Jesus John
[1:45:38] says John is asking
[1:45:41] us he's asking for us to ask
[1:45:45] you is he
[1:45:47] you or waiting for another one
[1:45:54] I was meditating on
[1:46:01] that and there are many opinions around
[1:46:04] that but what I was
[1:46:07] thinking John wanted to make
[1:46:10] sure that he had done his
[1:46:13] job he wanted to make
[1:46:17] sure Lord is it you
[1:46:21] or do I have to keep on talking about
[1:46:24] you do I have to continue my
[1:46:27] Ministry continue to Preparing the
[1:46:30] way is it you
[1:46:33] Lord or do I have to keep
[1:46:36] working I can imagine
[1:46:39] John in the last moments of his
[1:46:42] life wanting to make
[1:46:44] sure that he did his
[1:46:48] job what God called him to do
[1:46:51] do is it you
[1:46:54] Lord did I do what I needed to
[1:46:58] do did I finish what I needed to
[1:47:01] finish because if it is
[1:47:03] you I leave in
[1:47:06] peace because that's why you called
[1:47:09] me that's why I was born
[1:47:12] for that's why I came to this
[1:47:16] earth that's why I came to this earth to
[1:47:19] introduce the Messiah
[1:47:21] I have to make
[1:47:23] sure that I did my
[1:47:29] job he believed so and he believed so
[1:47:34] much that he was the precursor of the
[1:47:37] Messiah the Forerunner of the
[1:47:40] Messiah what a great man
[1:47:43] brothers that's what made John so
[1:47:45] great that's what makes you so
[1:47:48] great he didn't Point him to
[1:47:52] himself he knew his whole life he had to
[1:47:54] prepare himself to point to someone
[1:47:57] else to point to someone
[1:48:00] else that's what made him
[1:48:03] great he was not
[1:48:07] worried on putting attention on
[1:48:10] himself but his whole
[1:48:14] preparation introduce the Lord Jesus
[1:48:17] Christ and he wanted to make sure
[1:48:20] in the fin in his final days I do my
[1:48:24] job come on
[1:48:27] church is there's someone here that
[1:48:30] wants to make
[1:48:31] sure do what God called me to
[1:48:39] do God gave
[1:48:42] John a
[1:48:47] message that brought Heaven to Earth
[1:48:52] that brought Heaven to
[1:48:54] Earth God has given us a
[1:48:57] message to
[1:48:58] us to
[1:49:01] us that will bring
[1:49:04] Christ back to
[1:49:07] Earth I'll repeat it
[1:49:09] again God has given us a
[1:49:13] message back to
[1:49:16] Earth I make you this
[1:49:19] question make yourself this question
[1:49:23] Lord why have you brought me to this
[1:49:25] earth what is my part in all
[1:49:29] this called me to
[1:49:34] do am I doing what you called me to
[1:49:38] do doesn't that pierce your
[1:49:43] heart that you can die
[1:49:49] tomorrow that does desire not come to
[1:49:51] your heart to say that if I
[1:49:54] die did I do what God called me to
[1:50:00] do did I fulfill what
[1:50:04] God for what God brought me to the Earth
[1:50:07] this Earth
[1:50:10] for when I see John like
[1:50:13] that see as confused prophet in the
[1:50:19] end
[1:50:21] I see him as a
[1:50:23] man who knew what he was here
[1:50:27] for and if he didn't finish the
[1:50:31] job he knew he had to continue
[1:50:35] it but when he
[1:50:37] heard I
[1:50:43] am the blind
[1:50:46] see the mirac tell them that
[1:50:49] everything's okay
[1:50:52] he has done what I told him to
[1:50:54] do he did it
[1:50:57] well that he
[1:51:00] did what he came to do there is nothing
[1:51:05] greater used by
[1:51:09] God God has called you to
[1:51:13] do satis that brings you more
[1:51:17] satisfaction there's nothing that brings
[1:51:18] you more peace
[1:51:22] will leave that you leave you more happy
[1:51:24] than to say
[1:51:26] Lord I gave my life for you I gave
[1:51:29] everything for you I finished the
[1:51:35] job I fulfilled what you brought me to
[1:51:40] do there's nothing
[1:51:46] greater maybe John can tell you youth
[1:51:53] it was six months that God used
[1:51:56] me it was a few months that God used
[1:52:00] me but it was the best months of my
[1:52:07] life what a
[1:52:09] man what a
[1:52:11] man what if God is preparing
[1:52:17] you in these last days
[1:52:24] when the most beautiful time on Earth
[1:52:25] will
[1:52:27] come when he comes for his
[1:52:31] bride what if if he's called you for
[1:52:36] that I make you the
[1:52:39] question what if God called you to use
[1:52:44] you for that
[1:52:48] coming
[1:52:53] there's nothing
[1:52:56] greater than being used by
[1:53:14] God I believe John I can see
[1:53:18] John
[1:53:20] when those two disciples came
[1:53:26] back I believe he took a deep
[1:53:31] breath I said I'm ready
[1:53:38] Lord I'm
[1:53:41] ready I'm ready to
[1:53:45] go thank you for allowing
[1:53:48] me to leave these these times with
[1:53:53] you and do this great
[1:53:56] work for
[1:54:02] you wouldn't you like to leave this
[1:54:04] earth like
[1:54:07] that
[1:54:09] church
[1:54:13] youth God is calling you to use
[1:54:18] you
[1:54:21] wouldn't you like to leave this earth
[1:54:27] knowing I did what you called me to
[1:54:31] do I believed
[1:54:33] you I stood up for
[1:54:35] you and I knew what I had to
[1:54:48] do
[1:55:01] how John
[1:55:02] [Music]
[1:55:05] Liv since he was
[1:55:07] born since before he was
[1:55:10] born and since he was
[1:55:13] born his whole
[1:55:16] purpose was to introduce the Messiah
[1:55:23] he gave he gave everything for that he
[1:55:26] didn't get
[1:55:28] married he didn't have
[1:55:31] children he didn't have a
[1:55:35] family he gave it
[1:55:37] off so God could use him for six
[1:55:41] months so God could use him for a couple
[1:55:44] months how happy he could have
[1:55:48] left said I did what you called me to
[1:55:52] do I fulfilled my calling
[1:55:55] father how happy he could have
[1:55:58] left I don't believe he left
[1:56:02] sad I don't believe if I would have made
[1:56:04] my life
[1:56:06] different
[1:56:08] youth if you would know if you
[1:56:12] knew the happiness that
[1:56:17] comes and doing what God has called you
[1:56:19] to
[1:56:22] do nothing
[1:56:26] can that we can
[1:56:30] say the holy spirit is here I believe
[1:56:32] the holy spirit is
[1:56:33] here why the holy spirit is here is
[1:56:37] there
[1:56:38] someone is there one person who can say
