[30:17] I ask you in your precious name
[30:22] amen amen
[30:26] okay
[30:27] as you all know we are now in the point
[30:31] you may be seated
[30:38] as you all know we are now in the
[30:41] character a new Bible character is
[30:45] [Music]
[30:48] Elijah Elias
[30:52] amen
[30:54] amen
[30:56] and you know who Elijah is instead is
[30:59] he was you know a mighty Prophet
[31:03] um
[31:04] who did many who did many miracles for
[31:08] God
[31:11] and he's actually one of the most
[31:14] complex characters in the old
[31:16] testamentos
[31:22] then his name means the Lord is my God
[31:26] so nombre significa El Senor is medios
[31:30] and
[31:34] amen amen
[31:37] during
[31:39] during the time you know his name you
[31:42] know means a lot to us
[31:48] especially in his time
[31:54] his position you know he was a
[31:59] propheta and you know what a prophet is
[32:02] one who is sent and called called and
[32:06] sinned by God
[32:14] to speak his word to his people Pueblo
[32:20] but you know he was also human era
[32:24] um just like you and me yo
[32:30] hmm
[32:31] yes
[32:33] amen
[32:35] when I think of Elijah
[32:38] I think he was more like a prophet who
[32:41] was perfect
[32:44] but he wasn't really
[32:48] Perfecto he was just like you and me
[32:53] compared to a brother William Brennan
[32:56] comparado hermano William Branham
[32:59] both were prophets who had a Ministry
[33:01] that was very mysterious
[33:09] that only God would reveal his hidden
[33:12] plan to them
[33:16] sometimes
[33:19] sometimes God works in mysterious ways
[33:23] he can sometimes understand
[33:28] and he did that with Elijah yellow is
[33:33] and so with brother Branham iwalkon
[33:37] hermano Branham
[33:41] his
[33:43] when we speak of Elijah you know when he
[33:46] first appears
[33:49] his origin you know he
[33:53] is not much said about him
[33:59] you know his beginning you know starts
[34:02] off you know just when he's about to
[34:05] deliver his message
[34:16] other than he was of the have
[34:19] inhabitants of Gilead or a Tish bite
[34:31] I think
[34:32] and I thought to myself
[34:36] then that if it was a coincidence
[34:40] that God will leave you know his
[34:43] beginning out of it
[34:46] or was it intentional or foreign God you
[34:50] know
[34:51] would just leave it like that ASI
[34:55] I believe it was intentional
[34:58] intentional because
[35:02] sometimes God doesn't
[35:04] always tell other people where they come
[35:06] from
[35:09] and we don't need to tell random we
[35:13] don't need to know where we're coming
[35:15] from
[35:18] because
[35:21] God knew how he was going to use him you
[35:24] know the beginning
[35:30] and he lived in Israel during the Ring
[35:33] of king agap and queen Jezebel and
[35:36] Israel
[35:41] who brought idolatry
[35:44] into Israel
[35:47] Israel and brought dark times in the
[35:50] land
[35:53] in that time you know
[35:57] it was you know a dark
[35:59] those were dark days during where Elijah
[36:02] lived
[36:05] and you know who King a have been Queen
[36:08] Jessica
[36:13] Ahab was a king
[36:15] you know a Jew by by birth
[36:20] but Jezebel wasn't
[36:24] she was a gentile
[36:27] and she was you know the cause for
[36:29] bringing you know idolatry in Israel
[36:34] turn the hearts of God's people from him
[36:44] and it was at that time that God brought
[36:47] Elijah
[36:56] and when he comes you know
[37:00] Elijah was known for a dramatic
[37:02] demonstrations and speeches
[37:10] and and we know
[37:12] we know it from when he speaks
[37:16] to to Ahab you know it wasn't really
[37:19] pretty nermoso
[37:23] and throughout his life he gave all
[37:26] those
[37:28] mostly to to the king and the and the
[37:32] Queen
[37:35] and he also performed many miracles
[37:38] muchos Milagros
[37:42] you know when I'm raising a kid Savage
[37:50] and multiplying The Jug
[37:54] and calling down fire from heaven
[38:02] we mostly don't see a lot of Miracles
[38:08] but we know that God does do miracles in
[38:12] our lives
[38:14] and you and I we are that Miracles
[38:19] amen amen
[38:23] he is sometimes described as Harry
[38:27] either he had lots of hair or had a
[38:30] camel tunic o
[38:35] yes
[38:39] and it's kind of funny yes yes during
[38:42] that time Tiempo
[38:44] because we don't see a lot of profits
[38:48] you know many prophets as being hairy
[38:50] having lots of hair or having a caval
[38:54] tunic
[38:57] especially especially when you think of
[38:59] brother Branham
[39:05] but I won't get any to that stuff really
[39:08] but
[39:09] the point
[39:12] but what Elijah did have like brother
[39:14] Branham
[39:16] he had a fiery personality that
[39:22] Fiera
[39:24] and he had a strong passion for doing
[39:28] God's will look
[39:33] videos
[39:38] he was very zealous for putting you know
[39:41] God first
[39:44] because
[39:50] many of times we are like that
[39:53] and brother Branham was also like that
[40:00] and you know he had strength
[40:04] forced us he was a wise and faithful
[40:07] Prophet
[40:09] Savio he will made wise decisions
[40:14] and he was faithful to to God
[40:20] and he was not afraid to speak truth to
[40:22] the king
[40:26] sometimes the truth is what
[40:29] what all we need to speak I mean someone
[40:31] doesn't want to hear it
[40:39] but he also had weaknesses
[40:43] he can
[40:44] you know
[40:46] as I said he wasn't perfect
[40:49] he tended to complain a lot
[40:53] how many of us use
[40:55] sometimes complaining
[40:59] yes amen amen
[41:02] and he was he was a lonera muy solo
[41:07] he made you know he was mostly alone
[41:10] during his life
[41:14] sometimes we're all also by ourselves
[41:21] and he also fled in fear to the
[41:24] Wilderness
[41:31] who won it
[41:34] who wanted to take his life
[41:39] how many youth are afraid when someone
[41:41] wants to take your life
[41:45] it's kind of shocking yeah
[41:53] but I think many of us can relate to
[41:55] Elijah
[42:00] We complain and we're mostly lonely and
[42:02] many of us are afraid of something
[42:15] but there's one thing that sometimes got
[42:18] my attention
[42:21] after his victory the victory on Mount
[42:25] Carmel
[42:26] Victorious
[42:29] Elijah Carmelo Elijah fled to the
[42:32] Wilderness yes Jupiter tree
[42:35] and
[42:41] in
[42:42] Albert
[42:44] and enable
[42:46] after the juniper tree
[42:50] he went to mount
[42:53] where God appeared to Moses
[43:00] here is Elijah you know just fleeing
[43:03] from Jezebel again
[43:06] and finding refuge in a juniper tree
[43:16] that's sometimes where we sometimes go
[43:19] you know our refuge yeah
[43:23] Elijah you know he
[43:26] he was so depressed
[43:30] that God asks that he asked God to take
[43:33] his life there is
[43:37] right yes sir yes sir but you and you
[43:40] know how the story goes
[43:42] an angel came and met him
[43:49] him
[43:50] and then he went to Mount Horeb 110
[43:54] were the same place that God talked to
[43:57] Moses and Ms
[44:00] he was now go he now went to this
[44:03] mountain
[44:06] I have here
[44:09] in the message what here is thou Elijah
[44:14] escuchas Elias preached in
[44:18] 15 in the year of 1959
[44:24] you can put it up
[44:31] and he called to him and there went the
[44:34] rushing wind through that tore up the
[44:37] mountain
[44:44] Tim amen
[44:58] I'm sorry to keep you waiting but bear
[45:00] with me brothers and Youth
[45:04] foreign
[45:19] the Rocks ran and fell down
[45:22] Elijah's just said said and listened
[45:29] and there came a shaking an earthquake
[45:32] that shook the mountains
[45:40] but Elijah's just said still
[45:44] and then come the fire
[45:47] fellow Fuego
[45:50] lightning flashed and Elijah's set still
[45:56] and then a still Small Voice spoke
[46:02] and Elijah answers
[46:06] he wrapped his mantle over his face and
[46:10] walked down
[46:13] I just wondered that if we haven't
[46:15] listened too much to rush rushing Mighty
[46:18] winds
[46:23] and Fire and Blood and everything else
[46:25] is
[46:27] and have failed to hear that still Small
[46:30] Voice
[46:33] I wonder if we looked so much to gifts
[46:36] that we can't see the
[46:38] givers
[46:43] you know America is prone to noise
[46:49] that's the reason rock and roll is so
[46:52] popular and all these things these other
[46:54] lots of noises
[47:00] now we've had rushing Mighty winds we
[47:04] had great shakings
[47:09] but where has God been in all of it
[47:13] yo Elijah said he was not in it
[47:19] what did we do with rushing windsos
[47:26] what have we what have we done with all
[47:29] kinds of Sensations
[47:37] my time is Almost Up Guys
[47:42] Brothers but you can look it up if
[47:45] when when this is all over yes
[47:48] didn't read the entire message
[47:52] but my point is that the devil can bring
[47:55] us some voices and noises of fear
[47:58] Diablo
[48:03] depression entertainment and
[48:05] distractions of the world
[48:10] [Music]
[48:16] that keep to keep us from hearing God's
[48:20] voice
[48:23] but if we just
[48:25] just be still and see that God is in the
[48:28] sounds of rushing wins
[48:33] earthquakes and fire and Thunders
[48:40] itrenos then we Christians can really
[48:43] hear that still Small Voice
[48:49] amen youth amen
[48:52] that is how Elijah found rest
[48:54] reassurance in God's voice
[49:02] and so can we if we let ourselves be
[49:04] still and seek what God can do in our
[49:07] lives
[49:16] here in I got one in the
[49:21] in the first chapter you know for in the
[49:24] chapter of First Kings 9 19 the 19th
[49:28] Chapter
[49:30] and it was so when Elijah heard it that
[49:33] he wrapped his mantle in his
[49:35] face in his mantle
[49:39] and went out and stood in the entering
[49:42] in of the cave is
[49:46] yeah
[49:47] and behold there came a voice onto him
[49:50] and said what do is thou hear Elijah
[49:52] says
[49:57] that's how the Widow at seraphat
[50:00] happened to her before Elijah came to
[50:02] her
[50:15] yes
[50:19] Tim
[50:23] is
[50:27] and she like Elijah heard that still
[50:30] Small Voice and God
[50:33] from God and let her be used by him for
[50:36] his purpose is
[50:42] that's all I have to say is this Pulpit
[50:47] to our brothers
[50:48] [Applause]
[50:58] God bless you
[51:01] God bless her brother Andrew Congress
[51:05] tonight sometimes
[51:18] and when God comes to speak I mean it's
[51:22] something simple
[51:24] and it's night with titled is
[51:27] listening to his voice
[51:30] that is our theme our title for what
[51:32] we're talking about
[51:35] and again thanks
[51:38] to stand behind here
[51:40] hey I always forget to give thanks
[51:49] to read the scripture
[51:54] First Kings 17.
[51:59] verse one we'll be reading tonight
[52:04] if when you have it you can please say
[52:06] Amen
[52:08] Christo let's read this in the Lord
[52:11] Jesus Christ
[52:19] who was of the inhabitants of Gilead
[52:22] said unto Ahab
[52:24] um
[52:30] as the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[52:32] whom I stand there shall not be due nor
[52:35] Reign these years but according to my
[52:37] word
[52:41] and the word of the Lord came unto him
[52:43] saying is
[52:51] getting hands and turn the Eastward and
[52:54] hide thyself by the Brook Chariot that
[52:57] is before Jordan
[52:59] that is before Jordan
[53:06] Thou shalt drink of the Brook and I have
[53:09] commanded the Ravens to feed thee there
[53:11] is
[53:15] so he went and did according unto the
[53:17] word of the Lord
[53:21] for he went and drove by the Brook
[53:23] Charis that is before Jordan
[53:33] and the Ravens brought him bread and
[53:34] flesh in the morning and bread and flesh
[53:36] in the evening
[53:37] and he drank of the brook
[53:39] you may be seated
[53:47] the title is listening to his voice
[53:52] I like to base myself off on the first
[53:54] scriptures
[53:58] where it says
[54:01] has the Lord God of Israel lived
[54:03] yesterday
[54:09] we believe that we're in his presence
[54:17] we believe that in that time
[54:20] there was a scarce of his words
[54:24] they wouldn't listen to his voice I mean
[54:31] Elijah was in his presence
[54:35] before coming to the king
[54:38] foreign
[55:38] foreign
[56:38] and thus saith the Lord
[56:48] amen
[56:52] we see that that Elijah was in in his
[56:56] presence I
[57:00] want to read a little bits
[57:07] now we're going to typify that to
[57:10] spiritual drought today right now
[57:13] we all recognize
[57:16] and we are in agreement
[57:19] that there is a great spirit
[57:22] today nowadays
[57:31] did you know that by the prophecy was
[57:33] said to come before the the Second Great
[57:36] coming of the Lord
[57:38] there will be a hunger on the land
[57:43] and it wouldn't be hungry only from food
[57:46] or from bread
[57:48] or hunger from hearing the word of God
[57:52] that day he is here today
[57:55] here the the word I mean the true word
[58:00] that's just like I told you in the
[58:02] beginning
[58:04] sometimes
[58:08] and God is simple I mean
[58:17] Elijah had a
[58:29] himself didn't provide himself this
[58:31] place
[58:42] throughout this time of the droughts
[58:47] that his food was provided day by day
[58:49] necessity
[58:53] he did not need to worry about what was
[58:55] going to happen tomorrow
[59:01] God had told them
[59:04] I have ordained the Ravens and they will
[59:08] feed you
[59:09] what a marvelous thing is
[59:13] the type of secret place that we have in
[59:16] Lord in the Jesus Christ
[59:20] when the word was presented to him
[59:25] or to them
[59:28] did it why because
[59:30] they got far from it is
[59:37] this is also what the people had during
[59:39] the Days of Elijah
[59:41] and departed from the word
[59:43] they believe they have the word and they
[59:47] truly didn't have it
[59:54] let us know that the time that God was
[59:57] going to
[59:58] punish the unbelievers
[1:00:01] he provided a way out
[1:00:05] for the believer
[1:00:08] the saying that it is
[1:00:11] the same as as always
[1:00:15] if God brings judgment
[1:00:18] he has also brought Mercy I mean
[1:00:21] he has revealed his plan of Escape
[1:00:29] as well as for Moses
[1:00:47] doesn't matter what may come if God has
[1:00:50] told you that he will
[1:00:55] fulfilled
[1:00:57] word he is
[1:01:00] he has not changed
[1:01:04] today and forever
[1:01:16] El Senor
[1:01:19] is
[1:01:22] where we're coming for the coming of the
[1:01:24] Lord amen
[1:01:26] there is going to be a drought
[1:01:29] we believe that now many say okay
[1:01:32] the summer waiting on God

[1:03:22] Elias the Prophet Elijah
[1:03:25] Elias is
[1:03:28] the most important characters of the
[1:03:31] Bible
[1:03:32] is
[1:03:39] how the spirit of Elijah was used by
[1:03:46] spirit
[1:03:56] ISTA in John the Baptist foreign

[1:04:43] um
[1:04:45] and I want to read a scripture
[1:04:53] enl
[1:04:55] ivro de Amos in the book Amos
[1:04:59] 3-7 they say it says
[1:05:08] sure the Lord God will do nothing but he
[1:05:10] revealed his secret
[1:05:12] once again I'm going to read it
[1:05:17] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:05:20] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[1:05:23] servants the prophets
[1:05:26] 14.
[1:05:30] [Music]
[1:05:44] it says like this foreign
[1:06:21] [Music]
[1:06:38] [Music]
[1:06:50] how he spoke of her being a woman that
[1:06:52] painted herself
[1:07:38] you know
[1:07:42] Como
[1:08:01] is and just as in those times
[1:08:24] age of History
[1:08:30] God sent them a Prophet
[1:08:33] The Prophet Elijah
[1:08:41] brother William Branham
[1:08:46] in the adequate time
[1:08:49] the exact time
[1:08:52] when the word was
[1:08:56] the people needed of God
[1:08:59] the Widow
[1:09:02] receive the prophet is
[1:09:04] she heard his voice
[1:09:09] how God works
[1:09:15] yeah see and in that way
[1:09:19] we also hear that
[1:09:21] through a prophet
[1:09:25] not just any kind of profitable
[1:09:30] that was tried
[1:09:33] and it was God speaking through man
[1:09:39] the true
[1:09:45] the message in the messenger son Uno
[1:09:48] they are one
[1:09:50] Elias
[1:09:53] Elijah sent out his message
[1:10:04] it won't rain until I say it will
[1:10:07] another
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:11:06] said
[1:11:16] God however it might be
[1:11:18] he brings us the word
[1:11:24] she
[1:11:26] didn't have a husband
[1:11:29] she had no more food left
[1:11:32] it was just her and her child
[1:11:35] and they waited for death but in the in
[1:11:39] the opponents
[1:11:42] when they needed someone
[1:11:45] God sent a prophet
[1:11:48] God sent a prophet
[1:11:51] is
[1:11:54] but the prophet doesn't come just
[1:11:57] he always comes to bring something to
[1:12:01] bring his word
[1:12:03] man
[1:12:05] I want to read a quote of brother
[1:12:07] Branham

[1:12:18] further Brandon says the message God's
[1:12:20] way that's been made
[1:12:24] she goes in speaking Yeah
[1:12:29] she takes these two sticks and break
[1:12:32] things
[1:12:37] way of breaking the stick brother Brown
[1:12:39] says that was a cross
[1:12:42] of course yes La Cruz and in the cross
[1:12:49] they burn it right in the middle
[1:12:51] Fuego because
[1:12:53] that's where the fireworks burned
