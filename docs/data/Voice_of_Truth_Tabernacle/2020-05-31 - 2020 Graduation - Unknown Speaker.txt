TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] my name is sam i'm 13 years old and i am in ninth grade if i could go back and fix something you would be fixing my grades turning my homework on time and this is paying a little more attention like if it's by god's will i see myself in church preaching the word of god and if i'm old enough i see myself married like a beautiful christian girl who gave my heart to the lord a bunch with a bunch of kids like my dad serving the lord god has helped me by helping me be more responsible be more caring and being more mature put god before everything but god in your heart so then he could guide you throughout your life i want to thank my mom my dad my friends for all they've done for me and here i am without them i wouldn't be here right now go niners they will pray every day read the bible every day and always trust in the words process my name is luis i'm 14 and i'm graduating from eighth grade being in college this machine college is [Music] um he's helped me a lot um helped me get good friends you know and um just taking care of me through this home until now he's helped me by um staying away by bad people my best people like i just drugs um i would just say um [Music] okay good friends you know uh people that want to finish school you know just don't hang out with like some bad people um people that um you all kind of that stuff so one day i went to wrestling practice and i had to take off my shoes because wrestling shoes yeah i left my shoes by my backpack and then uh from uh after i came back into the locker room they were wrong they were stolen i had to work outside there [Music] my mom thought that um just turning to work you know i'm just like always uh praying listen to god listen to your mom because she gives you good advice my name is linda i am 11 years old and i am graduating fifth grade if i could i would go fix the way acted to other people and fix my grades i can tell god to help me on what i'm going to be doing something funny that happened to me in school is when i tripped and fell and my friends i'm in front of my friends i see myself in the future um i see myself with my family with my dad because he does not want me to get married kids bullying me and making fun of me god has helped me with some tests that i've been doing at school to trust in the lord and to be brave god has taken care of me with many things [Music] um pray and read the bible shout outs to my mom and dad my name is emmanuel i'm 13 years old and i'm in eighth grade i would fix my grades not do drugs [Music] in college he has helped me by not catching the virus um to have faith in god um with my schoolwork my name is alyssa alfords and i'm a 12th grader all the moments i procrastinated it would be to procrastinate less i was walking in the wrong class for straight two weeks freshman year i see myself already graduated from college and having my own small business i would say all the homework they gave us god has helped me so much because there's been so many stressful moments that i had to go through being in school and god has helped me calm all those stress levels down i encourage kids to put always god first and he will help you a lot just always put god first and pray before your exams i would give a quick shout out to all the teachers that helped me and pushed me and also my parents as well my name is mariana ferrer i'm 19 and i am no longer in high school thank god some things i could go back and fix are too be more better at my time management and to not try to find my closest friendships in school something i can do to help my future would be to take every step that i or every choice and decision to god first before i make it funny thing that happened to me in school was i got him with the basketball in the face and my glasses broke in the future i see myself as a teacher for kindergarten i hope and maybe even trying to start a homeschool for the families and veteran church the thing that i least liked about school is the whole system honestly pretty much sucks god has helped me with postponing due dates on assignments that i couldn't finish or just allowing me to find happiness in him rather than in friendships in school or other things for other kids i encourage that you find god in everything you know and the simplest things and that friends from school aren't always gonna fulfill that happiness or joy that you need god's the best realest and truest friend that you can find words of encouragement i would give is that being yourself is the best you that's that's how i did it shout outs to my mom and dad for supporting me and at the same time being strict enough and having that balance with me so that i can succeed more at school i'm ruby i'm 13 years old and i go to 8th grade some things i could go back and fix was probably the decisions i made this year and like the friends i chose to hang out with look for god definitely and surrender my life to him probably still being the pianist of the church and hopefully still following god probably when we all got back from a field trip and everyone like left and i kind of just got stuck outside and i couldn't go back in um probably all the bad influences and he's helped me being able to trust my mom and for the data and like tell them if i ever need something if i'm struggling probably just like be yourself and don't don't follow what bad people do because it can lead you into a big trouble through brother dito because he's helped me a lot to see that i can do good things if i can focus and ask god to help me well my name is timothy hernandez i am graduating from 12th grade and [Music] my alumni something i can do to help my future would be focusing myself more on god and seeking more of him definitely i see myself in the future with a stable job a family i see myself working with fifi in a job somewhere god has helped me till now by definitely protecting me and sometimes situations which i think were impossible to come out from and leading me through the right path what i encourage kids that are great graduating after me would be don't let peer pressure get the best of you it's not something i know i know it's sometimes it may be hard but it definitely is possible it's just a matter of focusing yourself on god and knowing that god is always there i shout out to my parents be happy [Music] do we smile yeah talk do whatever you want yes yes okay that's good i like football but not as much as god you know because god comes first in life and then other stuff second right it's true all right two and why is there three over here look one two three four and why is there three oh [Music] you're straight like that [Music] all right tell us something about yourself like what oh come on tell us something about yourself my name is emmanuel tell us something about yourself my name is emmanuel i'm for um my how has god helped you helped you till now uh he has helped me by not
