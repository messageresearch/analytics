morning [Music] me Jehovah Jireh of yours [Music] and you are more than enough [Music] Joe Mariah [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that is true [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] bless you it's always good to be in the house of the Lord amen if we can open up our scriptures chapter five in verse one whenever you can say Amen when you have it again maybe we'll go ahead and read it and [Music] also in time passed when Saul was King over us and that was he that let us out and brought us in Israel and the Lord said to thee Thou shalt Feed My People Israel and thou shalt be a captain [Music] so all the elements of Israel came to the king to him running King David made a league with them in Hebron before the Lord and they anointed David King over Israel boys and then we'll jump down to verse 10 real quick and it reads like this it says and David went on and grew great and the Lord God of host is with him and if we can bow our heads and pray to the Lord Heavenly Father Celestial we thank you Father for another opportunity you've given us to be in your house we come here humbly before simply asking that you come and speak to us Lord Jesus help us God to receive your word Lord Jesus in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated amen today we're going to be talking a little bit about David amen and uh how his Reign began amen and for a title we've chosen identified with the king I mean if I could place a subtitles amen amen so just to paint a picture here we see that David after the passing of Saul um pointed once again and he's placed as king amen amen so David in in us what he's doing is he's uniting the two kingdoms is Judah and Israel that's what he did amen amen in that verse 10 I really spoke to me when it said he went on and grew great amen amen because the Lord God of hosts was with him one more time because the Lord God of host was with him amen and I just want to talk a little bit about what it means to be and or to do amen because many of us want to be Christians amen I know I certainly do amen however wanting to be a Christian Cristiano doesn't necessarily mean it's true amen I always wanted to go pro yo professional in whatever athletic activity remember I didn't have the discipline or the genetics unless there's an action that accompanies a desire we have for uh to be a Christian it won't come to pass amen lives there amen how we have to know that we are Christians amen I mean if we can bring this to David we can see that David may not have known that he was a King David may not have seen the plans that God had for him but from a young age we can see God preparing David for his purpose [Music] we see that God wanted a Shepherd for his people God sent David out to Shepherd's Sheep amen amen God wanted a warrior so God sent David out to to lead all the military campaigns under King Saul amen now I imagine as a Young Man David may not have always wanted to do these things maybe he didn't always want to go out and tend to Sheep amen because when you read in the Scripture it gives the impression that it wasn't a walk down the block amen okay it might have been a couple miles out and I'm sure you went by foot amen perhaps were some battles he didn't want to fight but he still went on amen amen and what about us maybe there are things in our lives that we don't want to do amen there may be times we don't want to come to church sometimes we don't want to pray or read the Bible one thing I can say for certainly is that if we're here in in this building tonight amen David didn't shy away from what God wanted for him and that all led up to this moment um as him being crowned as kings amen so then I ask you youth where has God placed you amen amen what are you going through right now many times God wants to use us amen but he needs those attributes to be released from us maybe God wants someone honest so he presents an opportunity maybe God needs an overcomer so he places Us in Temptation amen God wants to use us and he wants to show us who we truly are amen amen praise be together adios amen now if we can just imagine for a moment what it would have been like if David had rejected his identity as a king if when Samuel came and anointed him if he rejected it if you would have said no well I'm not adequate to be a king oh that's not who I was intended to be I want to go do this or that amen David would have lived his life never truly knowing who he was intended amen Samuel could appreciate time and time again to him Samuel could appreciate that time and time again soon but I wouldn't have done him any good unless he believed in himself and in our case the preacher can come and tell us but it comes down to if we believe it that you are who God says to want to be a Christian but to do what a Christian does and then I want to share a quote real quick from Brother Branham it's in the message has the Lord spoken only to Moses and it says like this it is but now we can't expect the gospel of Christ to be popular now the gospel this is not the gospel this is part of the Gospel said the word the gospel evangelio came not in word only through Power and manifestation of the Holy Ghost manifestation is that right the gospel is not the word the word's just a dead letter it's got to take the letter Quicken and made alive and brought to pass what the letter says that's the gospel in other words with brother Brandon is trying to bring him is that it's not enough to hear the Gods amen I believe that brother is God Jesus didn't just call us to preach the gospel amen he called us to be the gospel amen and a lot of people grow tired of hearing the gospel priests behind the pope personas and that's understandable yes because anyone can come up here whether it's a male or a female it's really easy yes but I believe that's why brother Branham always said he said don't Don't Preach me a good sermon he said leave me one amen amen amen praise be to God I'm going to go ahead and read here in the Book of James chapter one Santiago UNO verse 22. verse it says like this it says but be ye doers of the word and not hears only deceiving your own selves sorry boss only in English we cause ourselves to believe something that's not true when we only hear the word we fail to admit to ourselves that this word and this message is amen because when we only hear the word we call ourselves to forget Who We Are we cause ourselves to forget who we are when we okay I mean I can't recall the countless times that I hear an amazing sermon and then I leave church and I forget what it was about amen I hope I'm not alone amen amen if you continue on to verse 23 this is foreign and not a doer he's likened to a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself sorry go ahead is where he beholds himself and goeth his way straight away forgetth what manner of man he was amen there's only one true mirror we have on this Earth there's only one way there's only one true mirror if we really want to see who we are and we want to identify ourselves we ought to look in the word amen amen the rest of what we try and see ourselves as well we compare ourselves as it's all paintings and pictures of something else amen I can hold up a picture of someone else I can hold up a picture of my brother a lot of times God is trying to tell us that we are who we say we are right God wants to show us who we truly are most amen if my brother can't get ready I'm going to be closing verse 25 of the Book of James it says like this but who so looketh into the perfect law of Liberty it continues therein he being not a forgetful hear but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed myself amen if you take that last piece it says that this man shall be blessed in his deeds I mean you see this very thing that happened in David's life and in verse 10 that we read it said I'm going to go ahead and summarize it pretty much says David grew great because God was with him so then if I can leave you with anything I'll leave you with this if you stay with God and if you stay with his words thank you [Applause] [Music] God bless your brother Diego he's a young man that is on paper yes [Music] Sarah is special on this Mountain this mountain Syrian those that went out and those that went up with David were giant Killers or giant Killers I would give their lives for David how many men and women do we have here foreign or the association of an alliance over Association now notice this is a place of a pactory covenant now people many people get stuck here because they don't like to make a call many people don't like to give us let's just get together you go your way I'll go my way they don't make a covenant but once you make a covenant making a covenant David that's a covenant when you come to church that's when you accepted I made a covenant with him in a covenant with my God amen that's why many people don't want a covenant many people don't want to be engaged yeah that's the same thing in church they listen to a nice sermon and then they go home and what did he do with that nada nothing yeah but how are you going to live with him what have you done for the kingdom what have we done oh Brothers this is now a covenant the meaning is a treaty between two or more parties that agreed to comply with the pre the with the provision Association now an association a union the individuals of individuals with a specific purpose when you come to church and you unite yourself here is now we're all pointing to a special place now we all points and are going to a specific or special place now where are we going brother vamos where are we going we're gonna go to be with the King to go towards the king minimum yeah now I want to give some key notes I want to talk about then I'm going to pass the Baton until my brother Vidal now on Hebron here it teaches us or shows us God adds on to David ministerio de David God adds on to David's Ministry El Pueblo the people now the people David you want to know why because he lived here what he said when the people started a small sword good appearing guy who's not just a talker is and the Beautiful part about it is that God was with David an unconditional Covenant hello that Covenant was with them yes and that same convenience with us with you and I there was three and these fellows and said for you oh David and with you oh son of Jesse peace peace with you and peace with your helpers it says now look it says peace with you and peace with your helpers how beautiful that is what this man was doing he said that it says that he saw and he himself but he recognized that Jehovah was with David oh Brothers what beautiful it would be that we would recognize when God is with them with the woman that's very tremendous I'm going to be closing up now there's a loyalty and then there's a covenant loyalty and Covenants now these people these men were loyal those that surrounded David we're with him until death mujeres everyone up there with his two wives and he know him the jezraelite and the Abigail who was the wife on the ball the carmelites David also took with him the men he has it now look now here comes David his family now here's it now look Nosotros we a key here and we preach the gospel yeah we have to preach that means but also that our family back us up he was David he was going to take the kingdom but he also took with him his family here I am preaching yeah even talking about being a good father and hear my son hating the gospel many times we want to advance and we're running Pastor I like our pastors last Wednesday in the small groups in the homes we don't watch you know watch ing we're gonna sing what we're going to do this and that's how much time have I spent with my son how much time when have I told him fall in love with God we focus so much how many times are we talking about the assets yeah the essence like Pharisees foreign foreign more and the essence is love and this shall you fulfill all the Commandments that we love one another God bless you Brothers [Applause] uh if you were just open your uh Bibles to the book of First Corinthians chapter 13. I will be reading verse 4. we'll be reading verse seven it's good to see everybody in the house of the Lord everybody that visits us and those that are watching through the internet and may the Lord bless you you know what I think brother uh brother uh Diego and brother Fidel and bringing the great word that they brought the word of the Lord says like this charity suffers long and is kind charity envious not charity vonteth not itself is not El Amores it says bear with all things believeth all things hope is all things endures all things you service I really enjoy our preaching to the youth uh you know they're they're very special to me so I always I feel like a young man still myself amen amen every time I'm around to me you know you just kind of get that energy and last as long as they do anymore except okay you can stay up all night we can't do that anymore amen amen but the word of the Lord says uh we're uh I just kind of want to focus on uh on on love above all things you know I was kind of watching something I was I I watched something it was like a short clip and uh you know uh the guy says something I really liked you know we're going from uh you know the boys are going from from from being a youth you know to a transition to a man Los Muchachos I said Hombres no that's that's the goal anyway you know we we want that okay oh because one of the things that disqualifies you from the the priesthood is to stay in a dwarf but you know we don't want any dwarfs here in the church we want to reach the statue of a perfect man we want the young ladies the young ladies to to become women that's the goal amen amen you know uh but you know the I was watching uh what it said and it said you know uh the difference what's the difference between uh between a grown male and a man at Starbucks you know and uh I was uh and the guy goes on and he says he's like you know the grown male you know he uh the the the grown male he uh what he does is is he actually has the the suit of a of a man that's right he's like and uh you know so he dresses like the like the man hombre it's like but what the grown male does that he uh he expects everybody to serve him he wants everybody to serve them you see but uh the real man what he does is he tries to serve located that's what a real man does he's not waiting for somebody to come you know to do something in order to do something for him oh but a real man you know he's he's he just he's at the service of anybody that needs help you know and I believe that that's the kind of uh that's the kind of person that David was you see uh David you know we we want to like like Diego was saying you know he just he just did what he had to do you just handled business you know we can't just talk about it to be about it you know that's what I believe that's okay okay we can't just talk about the guys amen amen you know if you know this is you know David could have taken different uh you do because success gets to your head pretty quick you know they're actually a success actually has a sister that's right you know so if you're not careful you know ego can step right in there's a lot of times and you think you're the best thing that ever happened in the face of this Earth what [Music] and you will come to a fork in the road this is using his hands to illustrate boy it marks off these two directions he says if you go that way he says you will have to make you have to make compromises and you will have to turn your back on your friends but you will be a member of the club and you will get promoted you will get good assignments just to make the alternative clearer he said you can go that way and you can do something you can do something you see a lot of people he says this is he says you can go that way and you can do something for your country that's something for your Air Force and for yourself if you decide what you and you want to do something because you may not get promoted you may not get the good assignment and you certainly will not be a favorite of your superiors it says but you won't have to compromise yourself because you will be true to your friends being more more important than being true to your friends and being true to yourself that's the important thing is it's important to be true to your friends standard [Music] don't just try to be David wasn't just he didn't want to just be a king that was not in his mind he was just trying to do what God told him little did he know you know he just as time began to pass you see it and you know he just had all these victories he didn't know that he was actually doing the work of a king you see but it was all foreign I got the shoes you want the dress didn't quite fit the right way you wanted and you know you may not have got the car you wanted but it's always about you know anybody else is you're just in your own world I am here okay foreign is starting to do something amen amen and that and that's every day yes so as the

find encouragement these days I'll tell you where you can find it yeah [Applause] do all these things David David he never doubted he didn't doubt in his God he never doubted the promise he knew what was promised that it was only temporary the suffering only temporary amen amen we just want everything so fast a lot of times it's better to go through the temporary pain of suffering then have the long-term painter exactly what he said he said [Music] see not everybody may know that right now not everybody may know you're a son or daughter of God that's gonna stop you from doing what God gave you that's the level that said locations you may not get recognition this world may not recognize the world that the people didn't know that David was going to be their King they were persecuting him
