[28:12] as i was with moses so i shall be with
[28:14] you
[28:28] it was a very special convention
[28:32] i like what the brother said
[28:34] on friday
[28:38] that this generation
[28:40] new generation
[28:56] are
[28:58] brother branham said
[29:00] when you are sick

[29:05] that you're healed
[29:07] you are healed
[29:09] i'm healed
[29:10] i am healed
[29:34] but you know what it is
[29:36] it's your own decisions
[29:53] of decision

[30:02] with healing divine and everything
[30:05] it's yours go and take it hallelujah
[30:07] hallelujah
[30:10] god promised that you would walk
[30:13] in other words you're healing

[30:17] you have to take it
[30:19] god promised life
[30:48] the land
[30:51] they have to clean the house
[30:55] clean our house our home
[30:59] it's yours

[31:04] your neck
[31:08] you got to take the land yourself
[31:10] he gave he gave a chance
[31:12] and it's yours
[31:15] and possess it hallelujah hallelujah
[31:31] it was to each and every one of us
[31:33] god bless you
[31:42] god bless you
[31:44] brothers this was my first year of camp
[31:47] estafoe primer campamento perimerano
[31:51] i thought it was pretty cool
[32:00] yeah like the brother said the theme was
[32:03] as i was with moses so i will be with
[32:05] you
[32:10] and
[32:11] you know on the way there
[32:25] yes
[32:27] and it was a little tiring
[32:33] i got brother
[32:34] said
[32:38] it smells like feet
[32:41] yes
[32:48] the message uh as i was with moses so i
[32:50] will be with you
[32:54] our brother
[32:57] that
[32:58] pharaoh looked like at the people of
[33:00] israel like slaves
[33:05] nothing more than trash
[33:09] but moses looked at the people of israel
[33:13] and god's children
[33:16] and i believe that's what camp was too
[33:19] yo
[33:21] brother brandon said it's the angle you
[33:23] look at it from diesel
[33:25] depending
[33:27] i believe if you look at camp at a
[33:29] certain angle
[33:33] you'll find that god's there
[33:37] and the people there are god's children
[33:44] and
[33:46] on the way back it was a little tiring
[33:48] too el camino
[33:56] but
[33:57] it was a very beautiful experience
[34:01] and
[34:03] for those youth who haven't gone yep
[34:13] and
[34:14] yeah
[34:16] thank you
[34:18] [Applause]
[34:28] god bless you brothers
[34:32] so the first day that we got there
[34:38] they were cutting the lawn
[34:42] my allergies just
[34:45] didn't
[34:46] like
[34:48] they just hit me hard
[34:53] and it kind of affected me throughout
[34:55] the
[34:56] throughout the camp yes
[35:00] i would get tired yo me fatigue because
[35:02] i would get frustrated with my allergies
[35:09] but
[35:10] on saturday
[35:14] they were talking about
[35:17] the new generation
[35:21] and how
[35:24] we have to rise up
[35:28] because
[35:31] yeah because we're the new generation
[35:37] and
[35:40] so i feel like i had a pretty good
[35:41] service on saturday
[35:56] domingo
[35:59] in the morning service
[36:03] i couldn't really be in the service
[36:05] because
[36:06] like my
[36:07] i would get a runny nose super quick
[36:10] santuary
[36:12] [Music]
[36:15] so i was just outside sitting down but
[36:18] still watching and listening
[36:25] because foreign was uh brother
[36:28] bernie the second is
[36:32] uh
[36:34] no i mean william
[36:36] garcia william garcia
[36:39] and
[36:40] it got pretty good but i couldn't really
[36:42] feel anything
[36:43] on the outside
[36:48] but
[36:50] on sun sunday afternoon
[36:58] and
[37:00] the plays yeah there were there were
[37:02] some that made us giggle and all you see
[37:06] here
[37:16] and
[37:19] we had to do a play on neyman
[37:25] when
[37:27] he
[37:28] when moses told him to go wash in the
[37:31] jordan river seven times
[37:40] and um
[37:42] that kind of touched me yes
[37:45] because
[37:49] i
[37:51] i might
[37:52] um
[37:53] might be in church
[37:57] but
[37:58] i feel like i'm not fully in church
[38:04] i feel like
[38:06] i needed to be
[38:08] in like in the church if that makes
[38:10] sense
[38:15] and during the play
[38:19] neyman didn't want to fully
[38:22] listen
[38:24] completely and he would only go in the
[38:26] river like halfways
[38:32] and he he would be like oh
[38:35] it's not working
[38:39] and then
[38:41] i would tell him no seven times go in
[39:13] and i felt like
[39:15] after this well during the service we
[39:18] had a very special time
[39:22] i had a special time with god
[39:25] i felt like i was able to get fully in
[39:29] and be with god
[39:34] because i feel like before
[39:36] i would just be like
[39:38] no you could only go to a certain point
[39:45] but once i opened all my doors
[39:51] it felt super natural
[39:57] um
[39:59] yeah that's all i gotta say brothers
[40:03] well and all
[40:04] if you if you haven't been to the youth
[40:06] camp you see no i need a campaign
[40:17] gracias
[40:19] [Applause]
[40:25] [Music]
[41:37] gracias
[41:43] [Applause]
[42:04] [Music]
[42:14] there was a six of us on our one bed
[42:17] and it was very hot
[42:21] and like i said it smelled like feet
[42:24] william
[42:27] william was lost for three hours
[42:40] i felt like god has started uh heating
[42:42] things up
[42:52] we went to the cabins and then we uh we
[42:55] went to bed la proxima
[43:08] then we went to service
[43:24] and we all
[43:39] but it got to that point
[43:44] we went to bed in the next morning
[43:48] we went to a service
[43:52] not
[43:55] and we just felt like god was working up
[43:58] towards towards something else
[44:03] then the
[44:04] skit service
[44:06] began
[44:48] i
[45:01] there was other brothers there jumping
[45:02] and shouting as well
[45:05] we were crazy
[45:07] yes
[45:12] when i went to camp
[45:16] i said
[45:28] and i've been praying about something
[45:29] for a few months now
[45:33] and like matthew 7 7 says
[45:35] seek and you will find
[45:38] eva
[45:41] it will be given to you
[46:09] he got his 12 hours of sleep
[46:26] those that haven't gone to a camp yet
[46:28] yolo recommendo i would highly recommend
[46:30] it
[46:32] it helped me very much
[46:36] it helped me with my relationship with
[46:38] god
[46:43] and also to know that we're not the only
[46:44] ones that we have other brethren
[46:46] god bless you
[46:48] [Applause]
[46:54] um
[46:56] i really don't know how to give a
[46:58] testimony but we're gonna try
[47:01] so basically it started off when i first
[47:03] found out about camp i had since the
[47:06] beginning i told my parents i did not
[47:07] want to go so do not sign me up they
[47:10] signed me up anyways and for that i was
[47:12] very angry and i was mad
[47:14] at the file that they would sign me up
[47:16] when i said no
[47:18] but
[47:19] them being my parents and they know
[47:21] what's best for me
[47:23] um
[47:25] they knew that i was going to have a
[47:26] really good time and they knew that i
[47:27] was going to enjoy and receive something
[47:31] so
[47:33] on saturday the
[47:35] when we had service
[47:37] i
[47:38] was not expecting to have received
[47:40] anything or i didn't know what to expect
[47:43] i didn't think anything of it um as soon
[47:46] as
[47:47] we started singing um
[47:50] and clapping i started singing and
[47:52] clapping
[47:55] something i never thought i would do
[47:56] because i'm really shy and i keep to
[47:58] myself a lot
[47:59] but
[48:00] i knew that i was doing it for god and i
[48:03] knew what i was doing was right
[48:06] and i hope that he was proud of me in
[48:08] that moment and that he continues to be
[48:09] proud of me but
[48:12] once
[48:14] it was over i was excited but nervous
[48:17] for sunday for the sunday service
[48:19] because i didn't know
[48:21] if i would be receiving anything i just
[48:24] thought it would be a one-time thing
[48:26] but
[48:28] it didn't turn out that way um
[48:30] i received something again
[48:32] i started singing and clapping louder
[48:35] and i was
[48:39] i was
[48:41] surprised with myself because i never
[48:44] thought i would be doing that
[48:46] i'm very very blessed and thankful to
[48:48] have received something and i can't wait
[48:50] to go to camp again
[48:52] with that being said i also
[48:55] have started wearing skirts
[48:57] for the first time
[48:59] not something i would ever have done
[49:03] because i told myself and i told my mom
[49:05] that i that's not me that i was never
[49:08] gonna wear skirts that i'm gonna look
[49:09] weird in them and what if people look at
[49:12] me weird
[49:13] but that's not the case anymore i know
[49:16] what i'm doing is
[49:17] what god wants and i'm trying
[49:20] for him
[49:21] and
[49:22] i don't care about what the world says
[49:25] i'm doing this for him
[49:27] and i'm very blessed to be doing this
[49:29] and thankful
[49:31] so yeah
[49:33] that is my testimony thank you
[49:36] [Applause]
[49:46] god bless you brothers
[49:48] um
[49:50] it's nice to see everyone again
[49:54] i don't know i get a little nervous
[49:55] right here
[50:11] we went to camp
[50:12] campbell i didn't get no sleep
[50:15] we had a game thursday night
[50:21] varsity played at like 8 p.m
[50:32] isaac was picking us up at two o'clock
[50:34] in the morning
[50:49] when i looked at the time or when i came
[50:51] out of the shower giovanna was waiting
[50:52] in the
[51:06] is here
[51:11] uh well giovanna we actually had a good
[51:13] conversation
[51:18] i felt like i really connected with her
[51:35] like was for 30 minutes
[51:39] so i was like daisy right there
[51:43] i just felt like my head bobbing
[51:48] and then they sat me
[51:57] to be honest i didn't really receive
[51:58] nothing in that service
[52:03] and then um
[52:04] well then the food
[52:07] la comida the food was good
[52:11] but i don't know why every time i go to
[52:12] phoenix camp
[52:14] campamento de phoenix i can't eat no no
[52:16] no
[52:25] i was just eating um
[52:26] what are they called fruit fruit things
[52:28] those things that like you put on your
[52:30] tongue
[52:32] fruit roll-ups i was eating those things
[52:37] and um that's the only thing that did
[52:39] good to my stomach
[52:42] and
[52:44] well then
[52:45] that saturday
[52:46] service
[52:49] is when god kind of started working with
[52:51] us
[52:52] i hadn't gone to i didn't go to the
[52:54] altar that night
[52:57] but um isaac osorio
[53:01] he preached
[53:03] a really good message
[53:05] proud of him
[53:07] um but yeah he um
[53:10] i remember him saying
[53:12] talking about the
[53:25] because they invited them but they
[53:26] really didn't welcome him
[53:31] that really touched my heart
[53:34] i was like wow
[53:35] how many times have i invited him
[53:39] i really welcome him
[53:55] i was like
[53:56] i don't feel nothing
[53:58] i'm
[53:59] tired
[54:01] my stomach's upset
[54:04] so the next day
[54:06] yeah we had the place
[54:10] and um
[54:12] i remember
[54:13] um
[54:14] they did a game show play
[54:18] the television
[54:19] there was all these cases
[54:35] anxiety
[54:49] but phoebe picked one one before
[54:59] and
[55:00] that really touched me because it's like
[55:05] why can't we make so many deals with the
[55:07] devil
[55:10] but we can never make a deal with god
[55:14] and
[55:15] well i remember um that night sam was
[55:18] samuel little sam right here was sitting
[55:20] next to me
[55:23] and i still wasn't feeling nothing
[55:27] and i looked at sam
[55:29] he was ballin
[55:34] for him
[55:36] i was like maybe i'll just pray for my
[55:38] brother samuel
[55:41] might as well do something useful
[55:44] so
[55:45] he was just there raising his hands
[56:14] me and you need to deal with each other
[56:18] literally when i stopped
[56:21] someone came to samuel and actually
[56:22] prayed for him
[56:28] so i still didn't feel nothing
[56:31] but i went to the altar anyways
[56:36] and god just touched me right there
[56:39] he answered some questions
[56:42] and yeah i went back to my seat
[56:46] i was just happy
[56:49] that was really good services
[56:53] really fun time when we went to import

[1:02:30] brothers
[1:02:32] so
[1:02:42] god
[1:02:45] [Applause]
[1:03:04] this was my first time at camp
[1:03:09] and the letter we wrote before leaving
[1:03:14] specifically
[1:03:24] i was sincere with god and i said i
[1:03:26] don't know what i'm looking for at camp
[1:03:32] but i'm trusting that you will give me
[1:03:34] what i need
[1:03:44] and i went to camp and on friday i
[1:03:45] didn't feel much to say that
[1:03:52] i rejoiced at camp
[1:04:08] [Music]
[1:04:14] when i got back i was thinking on if i
[1:04:16] did receive something at camp
[1:04:19] testimonial
[1:04:22] and i was actually not going to test if
[1:04:23] i told brother dale
[1:04:38] i said god is so good and and we don't
[1:04:41] want to testify about how good he is
[1:04:46] and god has done great things in my life
[1:04:52] now was remembering
[1:05:07] if our destiny is in heaven or hell that
[1:05:08] was our decision
[1:05:14] and on wednesday brother titus was also
[1:05:16] preaching
[1:05:20] a decision to suffer in this world but
[1:05:23] how our riches in heaven is our own
[1:05:24] decision
[1:05:27] [Music]
[1:05:30] and i said i prefer to suffer in this
[1:05:32] world
[1:05:34] and
[1:05:46] what the devil offers us
[1:06:04] that it doesn't matter how much i try to
[1:06:06] find the things of this world to satisfy
[1:06:08] me
[1:06:10] no one will love me more than god
[1:06:12] satisface nothing will satisfy my soul
[1:06:15] more than his word more
[1:06:22] and i recommend all the youth to go to
[1:06:23] camp as foreign
[1:06:26] it was a great blessing for me
[1:06:28] god bless you
[1:06:56] there were many things going on
[1:07:05] and at some time i decided and told
[1:07:07] brother fidel
[1:07:09] you know
[1:07:10] i'm not going to camp brother
[1:07:38] i had spirits fighting against me to my
[1:07:41] left and right
[1:07:44] me but in my mind i said if it's for me
[1:07:47] to go
[1:07:48] i will go
[1:07:50] entonces
[1:07:53] see the cd so
[1:08:05] and i truly had high expectations for
[1:08:07] the camp
[1:08:54] i forgot his name but the brother was
[1:08:55] sharing that this camp seemed impossible
[1:09:00] and at that time my father and the
[1:09:02] brother were there um
[1:09:32] and then he said what if this camp is
[1:09:33] for you speaking to my father
[1:09:35] or what if this camp is for anyone
[1:09:37] says um
[1:11:00] i felt like something grabbed my hand
[1:11:03] it doesn't mean but i follow presents
[1:11:04] behind me
[1:11:06] very strong
[1:11:21] but i saw nothing happen i was
[1:11:22] meditating on god
[1:11:38] my father was nothing there anymore
[1:11:42] and i lifted my hand higher yo travis
[1:11:46] and i fell on another hand was squeezing
[1:11:48] me
[1:11:50] and a voice came to me
[1:11:52] saying
[1:12:21] and the subject was time of decision
[1:12:25] and as i was up there
[1:12:29] i was meditating and it said
[1:12:35] i said to myself sometimes i
[1:12:37] uh
[1:12:38] persona
[1:12:39] or a person
[1:12:48] forget about what god has done in their
[1:12:50] lives
[1:12:54] and i was reflecting if today is the day
[1:12:59] i make my decision
[1:13:01] to follow christ
[1:13:30] i believe
[1:13:47] god bless you brother
[1:14:10] this is my second time at camp
[1:14:22] this one would be like my first one
[1:14:25] pero
[1:14:26] pero estaba
[1:14:46] and i just i was like i could just stay
[1:14:48] home and just live here and just be just
[1:14:50] do regular things here
[1:14:51] pero
[1:14:53] pero yo
[1:14:54] sentien
[1:15:08] that i could go to camp again
[1:15:17] the road was long for me
[1:15:23] but it was worth it to arrive there
[1:15:29] first when we got there
[1:15:30] [Music]
[1:15:34] i didn't know
[1:15:35] what to expect
[1:15:39] [Music]
[1:15:47] but when uh but on the first day there
[1:15:49] savion
[1:15:54] i knew that i was onto something i was
[1:15:56] going to find something
[1:16:04] not only the answers i was seeking
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:15] but also something else that god had
[1:16:17] there for me
[1:16:42] but i knew that i wanted to find a
[1:16:44] relationship with qatar
[1:16:49] [Music]
[1:17:10] i knew i just wanted to be more than
[1:17:11] just a person that was in their comfort
[1:17:12] zone
[1:17:24] when i went to the services that were
[1:17:26] that were there you are
[1:17:28] your
[1:17:30] [Music]
[1:18:21] [Music]
[1:18:32] and i was blessed in going there in los
[1:18:35] angeles to the services we don't know
[1:18:38] solo in
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:19:01] i knew that i had the courage
[1:19:04] to
[1:19:18] to be able to be blessed and received
[1:20:03] i knew that uh
[1:20:04] i was there so that god could find me
[1:20:06] and and so i would follow him
[1:20:12] the same as joshua and moses did
[1:20:15] joseph
[1:20:18] [Applause]
[1:20:28] god bless you
[1:20:39] and thankful with god for allowing me to
[1:20:40] go to the camp i wasn't going to go
[1:20:42] um
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:54] a time back i was suffering a lot with
[1:20:55] anxiety
[1:20:58] and i was struggling also with the
[1:21:00] depression eating ammunition and i was
[1:21:02] scared of going
[1:21:05] and then to have an anxiety attack over
[1:21:07] there
[1:21:11] something was saying don't go because it
[1:21:12] could happen
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:16] but another park would say uh you could
[1:21:17] be delivered
[1:21:21] when we got to camp
[1:21:25] i felt nervous
[1:22:19] [Music]
[1:22:26] [Music]
[1:22:50] and
[1:23:01] there was a voice that was telling me to
[1:23:03] go back
[1:23:04] to the
[1:23:18] and
[1:23:33] to me
[1:23:35] when i went to the altar
[1:23:38] somebody went to pray for me
[1:23:42] and he said
[1:23:45] that this was my appointment or meeting
[1:23:47] with god
[1:23:50] and that we were there at the
[1:23:51] appointment
[1:23:56] and i said i wanted to i wanted to make
[1:23:58] my decisions
[1:24:39] and the pain would not be greater than
[1:24:40] he is
[1:24:55] my heart was my heart
[1:25:23] for making me feel weird
[1:25:37] very thankful and grateful with god
[1:25:40] that i am delivered
[1:25:43] from my anxiety and depression
[1:25:45] may god bless you
[1:25:58] i just want to say that
[1:26:00] this camp was such a blessing
[1:26:05] and
[1:26:06] i can say that um
[1:26:09] that what i received at camp
[1:26:13] was tremendous
[1:26:16] saturday night
[1:26:21] the yellow team i'm i think did uh a
[1:26:24] play croco
[1:26:28] and um it was about uh neyman before i
[1:26:31] saw that
[1:26:32] and um
[1:26:34] it was such a such a touching um drama
[1:26:42] because um
[1:26:44] when neyman
[1:26:45] went into that um when he dipped himself
[1:26:51] and then oh yeah after seven times and
[1:26:53] then dipped himself again like
[1:26:55] completely
[1:26:58] completely um he came out
[1:27:01] cleansed el salli
[1:27:03] and
[1:27:04] i liked how they brought it to our time
[1:27:10] how we hide our leprosy
[1:27:15] and
[1:27:16] i i i could relate to that because um
[1:27:21] i've been hiding a lot of things within
[1:27:23] me
[1:27:26] and um
[1:27:28] at this camp um
[1:27:40] uh
[1:27:41] someone prayed for me i don't know who
[1:27:43] it was but you know for me he was
[1:27:46] telling me that whatever i had
[1:27:51] just to let it go
[1:27:54] and just to start
[1:27:56] confessing
[1:28:04] and
[1:28:05] when he was praying for me and when i
[1:28:07] and when i when i started confessing
[1:28:12] um something
[1:28:15] was
[1:28:16] like
[1:28:16] my body tightened up
[1:28:21] and i knew it was god
[1:28:25] and
[1:28:26] i just started i'm just confessing your
[1:28:29] comments are confessed and it felt good
[1:28:33] um
[1:28:34] just to
[1:28:36] just let it all out
[1:28:40] just place it there before the uh before
[1:28:44] god's uh
[1:28:48] and um
[1:28:50] i can now say that i'm free
[1:28:54] and i don't have to hide whatever i had
[1:28:56] within me
[1:28:59] and um
[1:29:01] yeah that's it yes
[1:29:03] god bless you
[1:29:10] bless you brothers
[1:29:13] what i want to say is that camp
[1:29:16] um
[1:29:16] it was
[1:29:17] blessing
[1:29:18] amongst blessing upon blessing upon
[1:29:21] blessing from
[1:29:22] the
[1:29:28] sometimes we don't even look at that we
[1:29:30] start to not realize we get all excited
[1:29:32] and remote in the moment and we start
[1:29:34] seeing people and we we real we don't
[1:29:38] [Music]
[1:29:43] we start to overlook how god has already
[1:29:46] started to bless us from the beginning
[1:29:52] and it was until the end of camp that i
[1:29:54] realized that
[1:29:58] it was until the end of camp that i
[1:29:59] realized how much god has really blessed
[1:30:02] each and every one of us
[1:30:08] as you guys know from the beginning of
[1:30:10] camp i was extremely excited for all of
[1:30:12] us that we're going
[1:30:15] to use
[1:30:18] we got to
[1:30:20] and i was there and i was excited for
[1:30:22] the team that i was going to get yeah
[1:30:26] so i knew that my friend one of my
[1:30:28] friends
[1:30:31] was going to be a leader
[1:30:38] and i get to the camp i pick out one of
[1:30:40] the little wristbands
[1:30:44] and it was her team
[1:30:55] [Music]
[1:30:59] she's like here and she gives me a
[1:31:01] different response
[1:31:04] i was like lord jesus
[1:31:07] but little did i realize that god needed
[1:31:09] me somewhere else
[1:31:14] and little did i realize that god was
[1:31:15] going to use me in a different way
[1:31:20] and sometimes we try to it made me
[1:31:22] realize that sometimes i always try to
[1:31:23] push my way with god
[1:31:43] just to cut it short
[1:31:46] sunday night el domingo
[1:31:49] i was looking left and right
[1:31:53] and i was seeing all of my the youth
[1:31:55] getting blessed by the lord
[1:32:13] and the devil came to me and said maybe
[1:32:15] it's not today maybe it's not this camp
[1:32:22] maybe that was enough
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:32:30] but i got stubborn and i said no
[1:32:34] no like i'm not leaving until i get my
[1:32:36] blessings
[1:32:38] and brother after brother was praying
[1:32:40] for me
[1:32:44] but no one got to the point
[1:32:47] and i don't know why i just didn't leave
[1:32:50] you
[1:32:52] until someone came and gave me what i
[1:32:54] was looking at
[1:32:58] and it was until brother william came
[1:33:01] up william and god used him
[1:33:05] and he told me exactly what i was going
[1:33:07] through
[1:33:11] and that's when i knew yeah
[1:33:14] it was worth it to stay okay
[1:33:18] so what i want to say is that youth i
[1:33:20] know there's a lot of times that we
[1:33:22] don't understand and we don't feel
[1:33:24] anything
[1:33:30] but that's when i say push a little
[1:33:31] longer
[1:33:42] uh
[1:33:50] god bless you brothers
[1:33:54] um i just want to start off by saying
[1:33:56] that um
[1:33:58] that i didn't sign up to be here
[1:34:00] um to to come up and give my testimony
[1:34:05] um
[1:34:06] and i want to say that um that my
[1:34:08] testimony isn't anything crazy for
[1:34:11] for you guys but i feel like um
[1:34:13] testimonials
[1:34:16] but i feel like why um i just told the
[1:34:18] brother to come up here was to to ensure
[1:34:20] what i got
[1:34:27] um i can say um for everybody else that
[1:34:29] i feel like your poster
[1:34:46] um saturday everybody was in it i just
[1:34:48] couldn't
[1:34:52] yeah i was singing
[1:34:55] nothing happened
[1:34:59] sunday morning pass and i'm still tired
[1:35:01] [Music]
[1:35:04] but it's um sunday afternoon where you
[1:35:06] know everything happened
[1:35:10] um i think all the plays touched us
[1:35:15] and um like most some other people said
[1:35:18] when they were talking about when he was
[1:35:20] watched seven times of leprosy
[1:35:27] yeah it definitely um
[1:35:30] helped me a lot definitely
[1:35:33] um so for the second part i was blessed
[1:35:35] um
[1:35:36] by sharing my gift on playing the guitar
[1:35:40] ladder
[1:35:59] because
[1:36:00] we were at the church and we were
[1:36:02] checking if everything was going to be
[1:36:04] okay with the commercials and videos
[1:36:10] and natalie and um i'm not sure what the
[1:36:12] guy's name was uh was on the base and
[1:36:14] they asked me to go up and just play
[1:36:16] hinata
[1:36:20] um so i went up and afterwards they
[1:36:22] asked me hey um
[1:36:24] do you want to play for service
[1:36:31] yeah and i'm and i that's when i gave
[1:36:34] him that unsure answer
[1:36:43] um and afterwards they they talk to me
[1:36:45] and they're like
[1:36:48] we got the okay for you to go esta yares
[1:37:02] i didn't want to play i'm like i want to
[1:37:03] be down there i want to be here
[1:37:10] during like afterwards when they were
[1:37:11] worshiping
[1:37:14] um i was in it i was singing
[1:37:20] and after then i was still kind of like
[1:37:22] mad that i wasn't able to be a part of
[1:37:24] it
[1:37:29] um but now i know why
[1:37:32] afterwards i told a lot of the other
[1:37:34] youth i'm like
[1:37:37] that i feel like my body feels really
[1:37:39] tired
[1:37:43] not so much my fingers or anything i
[1:37:44] just felt like really worn out no
[1:37:46] simple
[1:37:49] and um i believe that that i was running
[1:37:51] and i was jumping like everybody else
[1:37:57] um i encourage everybody else to
[1:37:59] continue with the fire that we
[1:38:08] yeah
[1:38:11] i was asked
[1:38:15] but um yeah so let's continue with the
[1:38:17] fire that we got during the services
[1:38:23] um
[1:38:28] yeah i think samuel's coming up but um
[1:38:34] i think the main reason for camp is to
[1:38:35] be um amongst youth going towards the
[1:38:37] same goal
[1:38:42] you feel that motivation and that
[1:38:44] and that just great power towards you
[1:38:45] that gets into you like hey
[1:38:52] i definitely got part of that motivation
[1:38:54] in that fire definitely
[1:39:08] [Applause]
[1:39:10] um you guys could sit down if you guys
[1:39:12] want to support me
[1:39:15] i'm sorry it was my first time going to

[1:44:12] uh
[1:44:13] go to my heart

[1:44:17] i didn't really think
[1:44:19] yo no pence

[1:44:44] lord jesus christ brothers

[1:45:12] no i thank god for that
[1:45:14] you
[1:45:36] [Applause]
[1:45:42] god bless you brothers
[1:45:45] i just want to let the youth know
[1:45:48] not only in phoenix
[1:45:50] in phoenix but also las cruces
[1:45:53] they know us as
[1:45:56] a bunch of oddballs
[1:46:19] [Music]
[1:47:20] faith in the elders
[1:47:25] but in the youth
[1:47:28] but later on he says
[1:47:31] but the youth need the elders
[1:47:34] is
[1:48:00] what was going on in the first
[1:48:02] generation
[1:48:44] at his
[1:49:12] that in the very very beginning of the
[1:49:13] camps
[1:49:16] where our beloved pastor and our
[1:49:18] sister
[1:49:21] were witnesses
[1:49:25] and she would testify to me yeah
[1:49:52] and the sisters thought that the
[1:49:53] campground were on fire
[1:50:08] and they said wow
[1:50:23] it's not going to stop going no no no
[1:50:27] so why not join it
[1:50:30] why not be part of it
[1:50:34] why not continue that fire
[1:51:06] and it can be the same thing with us
[1:51:07] youth
[1:51:10] that was my blessing
[1:51:13] and it was a true blessing
[1:51:17] to enjoy with all of you
[1:51:27] [Applause]
[1:52:00] uh
[1:52:06] [Music]
[1:52:27] but i believe it's a different kind of a
[1:52:28] circuit
[1:52:31] because the testimony that each and
[1:52:32] every one of them gave
[1:52:35] is special it's something special
[1:52:37] brothers
[1:52:42] i just want to give thanks

[1:53:37] and they didn't turn out the way i
[1:53:38] wanted him to eh uno planeta one plans
[1:53:44] but god has a different plan
[1:53:48] i was going with the expectation
[1:54:48] us
[1:54:51] you didn't leave us not at one moment
[1:54:55] and i'm going to share this very quickly
[1:55:00] because god is really
[1:55:22] [Music]
[1:55:45] [Music]
[1:55:58] i see a car
[1:56:11] and i kind of turned and looked
[1:56:13] illuminated
