[25:11] [Music]
[25:22] God bless you brothers and sisters
[25:25] amen it's good to be among the saints
[25:29] that is a part of the message of the
[25:32] hour yes
[25:34] of this last stage
[25:36] amen the prophet of God said that this
[25:39] is the most glorious age
[25:43] but the scripture also tells us
[25:47] and I believe it's Revelation chapter
[25:49] three
[25:52] that the the loudestian church age
[25:56] this church is
[26:00] um says Amen to these things
[26:03] but because of their Works
[26:07] Thou Art neither hot or cold
[26:13] that's what the scripture says and
[26:17] we we might say oh we we do we do good
[26:21] works
[26:24] but in reality the Bible says that we're
[26:27] wretched
[26:31] Miserables
[26:33] blind and naked and we don't we don't
[26:38] even know it
[26:40] and that's the spirit
[26:43] that's the condition
[26:45] that this churches is in is
[26:50] but we're going to have to realize
[26:53] that we we can't play Church
[26:56] you know we're not we're not in a picnic
[27:00] [Music]
[27:01] brother says that we're in a battlefield
[27:05] the coming of the Lord is near
[27:09] and we have to overcome that that
[27:11] attitude that spirit
[27:14] with the loudest scene in church age
[27:25] for giving us the Revelation foreign
[27:54] amen yeah 107 capitulo
[27:59] and it'll be verse 19. versicolo and if
[28:03] you all have it you can say amen
[28:07] amen glory
[28:14] amen the word of the Lord says thus
[28:16] Allah
[28:20] then they cry unto the Lord in their
[28:23] trouble and he saveth them out of their
[28:27] distresses
[28:32] he sent his word and healed them and
[28:36] delivered them from their destructions
[28:41] all that men would praise the Lord for
[28:44] his goodness and for his wonderful Works
[28:47] to the children of men
[28:54] and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of
[28:58] Thanksgiving and declare his works with
[29:01] rejoicing sacrifices
[29:07] amen let's give him Thanksgiving
[29:10] and giving praise for his goodness
[29:17] Lord Heavenly Father
[29:19] yeah I the first thing that I can say
[29:22] Lord is
[29:24] forgiveness
[29:26] I'm asking forgiveness for my failures
[29:29] because I know that I have failed you
[29:31] Lord God
[29:33] and Lord Jesus I said we may keep on
[29:36] moving forward
[29:38] that you may put me aside Lord God
[29:41] that you may speak through me Lord God
[29:45] you may sanctify me Lord God
[29:49] that may be a worthy vessel to use Lord
[29:52] God
[29:53] um
[29:55] that you may speak through not just the
[29:57] youth but the whole congregation whoever
[29:59] needs to hear this Lord whatever
[30:05] um thing that that I would say that will
[30:07] be against your word please forgive me
[30:09] Lord God

[30:17] in the precious name
[30:19] of our Lord Jesus Christ

[30:31] earlier
[30:33] I'm not planning to preach tonight
[30:37] um I promise I won't preach
[30:41] um if you don't know me
[30:43] my name is brother Isaac
[30:47] Jr and I come from the city of Tucson
[30:51] and with me is my my dad my pastor um
[30:59] as well as my family and the part of the
[31:02] congregation there is
[31:06] my church Jerusalem Tabernacle Iglesia
[31:10] Jerusalem Tabernacle and we're very
[31:13] happy to be here
[31:15] we've been planning this trip to
[31:17] Colorado for three years now
[31:21] and every year we try to come but
[31:23] something impedes us
[31:27] but we're on God's timing amen amen
[31:32] um I would like to think
[31:39] and tonight I just want to you know just
[31:42] share my testimony with you
[31:46] with a uh a thought that follows it
[31:51] confession of your healing
[31:55] many and many of you know this already
[31:58] what happened to me earlier this year
[32:04] and I know that this church
[32:06] yeah Voice of Truth
[32:09] was praying for me and I will I would
[32:13] like um to thank you personally
[32:17] for praying for me earlier and
[32:21] um just to share for those that probably
[32:22] don't know what's going on
[32:27] this happened back in February
[32:30] of this year and one night
[32:35] um I was taking a really long just
[32:40] hot shower
[32:43] and it turns out if hot showers
[32:48] I didn't know this but turns out it
[32:50] makes your blood pressure go low you
[32:51] know
[32:55] and I was there for a while
[32:58] and that caused me to think in the
[33:01] shower
[33:03] in Latina and my mom heard the heavy
[33:07] thought on this on the tube
[33:09] in Latina and there she was calling my
[33:12] name knocking on the door yeah
[33:17] [Music]
[34:04] or more or less I didn't want to worry
[34:06] about it
[34:09] I will get random coughs
[34:13] and it would affect um
[34:17] and when every time I saw glad I
[34:19] couldn't really breathe
[34:22] and our cough and cough
[34:24] until I was sped off phlegm
[34:27] and then another thing is that it's good
[34:32] um I will get really itchy
[34:34] especially on my my legs
[34:37] and I was scratching them constantly
[34:41] to the point where I I start bleeding
[34:45] and another thing is that my watch
[34:49] will tell me that my heart rate is going
[34:51] too fast
[34:55] for for me not being active but I mean
[35:00] and I thought it was tripping
[35:05] and you know I just ignored it and
[35:08] another thing is that
[35:58] and I knew there was something wrong
[36:01] with me
[36:04] I didn't want to admit that there was
[36:06] something wrong with me
[36:09] because you know it was during the
[36:11] winter
[36:12] Olympics
[36:15] it's normal it's whatever it's normal
[36:18] and that was going on for about uh
[36:21] four months or so foreign
[37:14] the doctor told me that I had a giant
[37:17] tumor
[37:20] between my lung and hearts
[37:24] and there was little tumors around my
[37:27] chest and
[37:31] and then she said yeah it's cancerous
[37:36] and all the symptoms that I just told
[37:39] you
[37:41] match perfectly of what they told me
[37:47] the tumor was about
[37:50] six inches
[37:53] and it was putting pressure on my lungs
[37:57] and that's why I was coughing a lot I
[37:59] was blocking one of my Airways
[38:06] and and because of the rapid heart rate
[38:12] and that's why I felt it was bothering
[38:14] me in my ribs
[38:18] and when when they told me this this
[38:20] news
[38:25] my heart dropped
[38:27] hey I was in disbelief
[38:30] but when I when I finally came to myself
[38:35] I told myself I I just said no they can
[38:39] know no I don't accept it
[38:41] I I don't have nothing you don't think
[38:43] and and
[38:46] um I don't know if you caught it or not
[38:47] when I said
[38:49] I always I I said the doctor said I have
[38:54] this
[38:56] I never said I had it
[38:59] and from this day I don't claim I had it
[39:03] because I knew that the doctors can tell
[39:06] me whatever they find
[39:08] um
[39:09] but God has the last word
[39:12] and I would like to read a quote from
[39:15] our Prophet here
[39:17] it's from the message accept God's gift
[39:20] is
[39:23] symptoms is something like
[39:27] uh paragraph 14.
[39:29] symptoms is something like this is
[39:32] say tomorrow
[39:34] um when you go home now to your place
[39:38] the express agent will come up and say
[39:42] Steve are you missed though
[39:47] yes see I have a present for you
[39:50] all right what is it okay he hands over
[39:54] a basket or a box
[39:57] and you hear something hit in that box
[40:01] and you look in it
[40:04] it's a big box of snakes
[40:10] well you know no you don't well you
[40:13] don't want them things
[40:14] but you see I don't want them
[40:17] oh but they're yours
[40:20] somebody send them to you
[40:23] here's your name
[40:25] here's the name
[40:27] it's somebody it's somebody sent these
[40:30] snakes to you
[40:32] they're yours you have to take them
[40:36] now in one sense of the word
[40:39] they're yours in another sense
[40:43] somebody send them to you
[40:46] but they're not yours until you sign for
[40:49] them
[40:51] that you received them
[40:54] when you sign you receive them
[40:59] then they're yours
[41:02] but if you refuse to sign for them
[41:06] he has to take them back to the express
[41:09] company
[41:11] Express the express company has to send
[41:14] them to the one that sent them to you
[41:19] is that right
[41:21] well don't sign for nothing the devil
[41:23] brought we don't know
[41:25] no sir just refuse to have it
[41:31] I I just haven't got it devil you you
[41:34] take it all back
[41:36] that's all I won't have it
[41:40] refuse to have your sickness
[41:43] your arthritis whatever it is
[41:47] I just haven't got it
[41:49] by his stripes I'm Healed
[41:52] stand right on your ground
[41:58] and stay there God will bring it to pass
[42:02] no matter what it is
[42:05] just believe in him
[42:07] brothers and sisters sometimes we make
[42:10] it easy for the devil
[42:13] Diablo by accepting our sickness
[42:17] we signed the box and we don't even know
[42:19] it
[42:21] you know we sign a thinkiness from
[42:23] Amazon but it's the sickness from the
[42:25] Devils
[42:27] don't let that nasty devil come to your
[42:30] ear and say no problem
[42:33] oh it's cancer oh it's cancer no it's
[42:36] covid oh it's cold oh it's the monkey
[42:38] whatever oh it's a jungle yeah I don't I
[42:41] don't care what what name they put it
[42:47] let's be real now it doesn't matter how
[42:50] pretty it doesn't matter how pretty or
[42:52] scientific a name they put it
[42:55] we as message Believers of the hours
[42:58] no they're just demons from hell
[43:03] Jonah said
[43:05] that symptoms Alma
[43:30] I ain't Christian Brothers
[43:34] um I knew I knew when the doctor told me
[43:36] those words
[43:39] it's just lies of the devil
[43:42] trying to doubt my faith
[43:45] and do that try to doubt God okay
[43:49] and looking back at it you know as a
[43:54] humano I I had every right to doubt God
[43:59] to be angry at God
[44:01] for for letting this to happen
[44:05] but as a Christian Cristiano I have no
[44:08] right
[44:09] to question God
[44:11] over what he has done for me
[44:14] to be angry at him
[44:18] I don't understand that that I don't
[44:22] understand it
[44:23] or when people say I was mad at God
[44:27] you're mad at God
[44:30] Glory
[45:04] Hallelujah so because the tumor was was
[45:07] so big and and it was a lot of risk
[45:12] they kept me there in the hospital
[45:16] for three weeks foreign
[45:31] [Music]
[45:50] and something that the doctor said stuck
[45:54] with me
[45:57] um she said that this type of disease
[46:02] it's very common yes
[46:05] and no it's and no one knows how people
[46:08] get it
[46:11] and the I just you know that stuck with
[46:15] me
[46:15] and I just said man it's that stinking
[46:18] devil
[46:19] who else
[46:37] for for five rounds of chemotherapy um
[46:43] it was pretty tough
[46:47] um I still give him the honor and Glory
[46:49] yeah because
[46:52] um I've seen kids
[46:56] in the clinic that will get my
[46:58] chemotherapy
[47:00] where they would say that oh he has 21
[47:03] rounds
[47:07] oh he's been doing chemotherapy for
[47:10] three years
[47:13] and and looking at my situation
[47:16] I shouldn't be complaining
[47:19] no sir thank you Jesus for
[47:23] being for you are rich in Mercy foreign
[47:51] I went through
[47:53] um
[47:54] I went through chemo for three months
[47:56] and a half
[47:58] and the first couple of rounds
[48:03] um it was it was pretty rough it was
[48:05] pretty hard foreign especially for my
[48:07] body
[48:10] I never experienced something like that
[48:12] is
[48:14] I would get nauseous
[48:18] um if I if I ate something during
[48:21] chemotherapy
[48:24] um I just I will be disgusted by that
[48:26] food
[48:28] and even from to from this day I still
[48:31] get discussed from certain types of
[48:33] foods
[48:36] forgive me Brothers
[48:40] um
[48:41] I can't eat Church's Chicken no more
[48:44] Church's Chicken I just can't no no no
[48:47] it's one of those things where it does
[48:49] in your body
[48:51] and but I I still keep pressing on
[48:56] and before my third round of chemo yeah
[49:02] um
[49:02] uh I was starting to endure it better to
[49:05] feel better
[49:07] especially physically especially and I
[49:11] started to go to church again
[49:14] I started little by little playing an
[49:16] instrument and
[49:23] um
[49:24] and there was this one time Jesus
[49:29] um this brother was going to come visit
[49:31] our church
[49:32] and he was going to come visit us on a
[49:35] Wednesday
[49:36] and he's an English speaker so they were
[49:39] looking for a Spanish speaker to
[49:41] interpret him
[49:45] and I'll just go ahead and say I'm not
[49:48] I'm not too good on Spanish
[49:53] I am practicing
[49:55] and to to to put myself out there
[50:00] I told my dad hey I can interpret the
[50:02] brothers
[50:04] and just to just to be better at it
[50:07] and when
[50:10] um I checked my calendar
[50:14] and turns out having chemo that
[50:16] Wednesday morning
[50:20] so so I said I'll see how I feel
[50:26] and I did the Kim in the morning
[50:31] um I and then I went to church that that
[50:33] evening
[50:36] and I felt great
[50:39] it was like you couldn't even tell I did
[50:42] chemotherapy
[50:46] I interpreted that brother
[50:49] and I can say personally
[50:52] that was the best interpreting I've ever
[50:54] done
[50:56] even from uh from both English and
[51:00] Spanish in English in Spanish
[51:07] and I you couldn't I just felt great
[51:10] that said
[51:27] um
[51:29] I I I was I noticed that my hair was
[51:31] kind of thinning out a little bit
[51:36] and I would see a lot of hairs on my
[51:39] pillow
[51:42] so I did my first buzz cut
[51:46] and and from and I would and from there
[51:51] um it started to thin even more
[51:57] uh my eyebrows were gone
[52:01] my eyelashes were gone
[52:04] and I'll be honest with you
[52:07] I I was I was insecure about it
[52:12] but that didn't stop me to come to
[52:15] church
[52:18] I always I would always wear a hat
[52:21] you know we can't wear hats in church
[52:25] but I still I still Worship the Lord
[52:28] like never before
[52:42] and finally after my my last round of of
[52:45] chemo it is
[52:52] and just to see how things are
[52:56] and they told me that all the little
[52:59] tumors were gone
[53:02] the big tumor that was near my heart
[53:10] and it's there as dead tissue yes
[53:14] and there was no
[53:17] um active cancer cells
[53:20] the cancer now that was a victory for
[53:24] the doctors
[53:26] I already claimed my victory
[53:28] foreign
[54:06] just to say it that way you're actually
[54:08] interrupt your Vibes and
[54:12] he likes to just come out and say Boo
[54:14] out of nowhere
[54:17] the doctor told me that I don't need
[54:19] chemotherapy anymore
[54:23] but they told me that radiation
[54:27] was an option for me
[54:30] whether I wanted to do it or not
[54:34] so they scheduled me for uh to talk to
[54:37] the radiology
[54:42] and the steps of radiation
[54:46] just you know just to have information
[54:49] about it
[54:51] and I told God before I went
[54:55] Lord if the doctor convinces me to do it
[55:01] then I know that you'll be with me for
[55:03] it
[55:06] if I'm not convinced
[55:08] well then I know that I'm done
[55:12] so I went to radiology
[55:16] and the doctor comes up
[55:18] and the way that he was telling me this
[55:21] information
[55:25] it was in a tone foreign
[55:49] and and and then um he was trying to
[55:52] he was trying to put the consent form
[55:54] the paper
[55:57] for me I was signing up in my face
[56:04] and I said wait a minute
[56:07] I just came here for information
[56:10] my doctor said that I'm done
[56:15] and can't just at least think about it
[56:19] and like that smile
[56:21] kind of like faded away
[56:25] he was a little disappointed
[56:30] and he was like oh well yeah you can
[56:33] think about it
[56:36] I'll give you my number so so in case
[56:40] you change your mind
[56:42] the opinion but but ask your doctor
[56:47] um is there a better treatment than
[56:48] radiation
[56:51] if there is a better medicine than
[56:54] radiation
[56:55] um
[56:57] you go ahead and tell me for it he was
[57:01] doing a sarcastic man
[57:03] let me tell you I don't need no dog
[57:07] to tell me what's better than radiation
[57:12] he could have asked me
[57:14] what is better than radiation
[57:24] from Emmanuel's veins
[57:27] so don't tell me that there's something
[57:28] better than medicine
[57:31] because his word says that I am the god
[57:36] that healeth all your diseases
[57:48] that's what my Bible tells us
[57:50] so I left and I just said Thank you Lord
[57:55] for that
[57:58] um I felt like if
[57:59] I was doubting his healing if I took it
[58:06] and never before I felt good about it
[58:09] I never accepted that lie that said that
[58:11] cancer is still there
[58:15] and the devil actually come around
[58:18] oh when they have like just a little bit
[58:21] pain here
[58:22] if I get just a little bit itchy
[58:26] oh it's coming back
[58:48] knowing that the devil lost again
[58:52] and I would just like to read just one
[58:54] more quote for you
[58:58] from from our from the message the angel
[59:01] of the Lord is from paragraph 36.
[59:06] it says time's up brother and sister
[59:11] in the name of our Lord please give me
[59:14] right now
[59:15] uh what am I trying to say to you
[59:19] that God who came out in the old days
[59:22] and Let the Church of God
[59:28] out of Egypt of the bondage into free
[59:33] has come down again in the same manner
[59:38] to lead his church
[59:41] spiritual out of bondage of sin first
[59:45] by the Holy Spirit foreign
[1:00:00] immortality sorry the Transfiguration of
[1:00:03] the human bodies
[1:00:06] to transfer them into the perfect image
[1:00:09] of the Son of God
[1:00:12] please believe with all your hearts
[1:00:17] can't make no one believe right I can
[1:00:21] only can only speak of my conventions is
[1:00:23] to be true
[1:00:32] and if I speak the truth
[1:00:35] surely God will confirm the truth
[1:00:39] and we'll heal the sick

[1:01:09] um hard to explain Journey foreign

[1:01:39] I don't want to do this as uh to scare
[1:01:42] you
[1:01:44] or to or just as a threat
[1:01:47] but think about it what would you do if
[1:01:51] you were in my situation
[1:01:54] would you still praise God
[1:01:57] or would you run away
[1:01:59] be mad at God

[1:02:50] you or if you were in the worst
[1:02:52] condition
