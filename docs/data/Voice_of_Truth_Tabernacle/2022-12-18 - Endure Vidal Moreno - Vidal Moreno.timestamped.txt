[23:40] and my girls
[23:44] [Music]
[23:54] God bless you brother
[23:58] almost uh
[24:00] we're going to open our Bibles
[24:03] they're in Hebrews
[24:06] chapter 10.
[24:11] we'll be reading from verse 35 and on
[24:17] how many are happy
[24:20] it's a
[24:22] um
[24:23] it's an end of the year thoughts
[24:26] as a title
[24:28] um
[24:30] God has led me
[24:35] so title it endurance amen amen
[24:40] let's read the Scripture
[24:43] it says like this he said
[24:50] cast not a waiter for your confidence
[24:52] which had great recompense of
[24:55] rewards
[25:01] for you have need of patience that after
[25:03] ye have done the will of God ye might
[25:05] receive the promise
[25:24] now the judge shall live by faith but if
[25:27] any man draw back my soul shall have no
[25:30] pleasure in him
[25:39] but we are not of them who draw back
[25:42] unto Perdition but of them that believe
[25:44] to the saving of the Soul um
[25:49] if you can follow me to Philippians 1 6.
[25:54] this is
[26:05] being confident of this very thing that
[26:07] he which hath begun a good work in you
[26:09] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[26:11] Christ
[26:13] let us bow our heads and we'll be
[26:15] praying
[26:16] Heavenly fathers
[26:19] we are highly grateful with you
[26:24] for the privilege that we have to come
[26:26] to your house
[26:29] hear your precious word is
[26:36] had a great impact in each of Our Lives
[26:38] is
[26:40] something that has held us up yes
[26:45] that has allowed us to last Lord yes
[26:50] it's something that is very special for
[26:53] us
[27:35] Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[27:40] you may be seated
[27:46] go to English
[27:50] um
[27:51] as I said for a title I want to title it
[27:55] endure located
[27:57] amen amen I think it's a very uh
[28:01] important characteristic of a Christian
[28:04] Persona characteristics
[28:07] to be able to endure
[28:11] the word of God tells us
[28:14] that we must endure
[28:19] it's it's one of the characteristics
[28:23] that uh that should stand out in uh
[28:26] somebody that professions professes to
[28:28] be a
[28:32] Christiana they they should be able to
[28:35] look at you
[28:37] and uh
[28:40] that you're a Christian Cristiano by the
[28:43] way that you endure you said
[28:46] amen amen by the way you behave in
[28:49] certainly
[28:53] and I just want to read a definition
[29:00] and it says in the following manner it
[29:03] is
[29:10] to be able to withstand a process or a
[29:15] situation that is unpleasant or and and
[29:18] difficult uh to give up
[29:25] it's the the other one
[29:27] is
[29:36] amen as we look as uh
[29:39] aguanta that's what enduring means and
[29:42] um you know as the end of your thoughts
[29:46] when we think of endurance
[29:50] it's something that all Christians
[29:52] should should have
[29:55] you know and we can profess to be a
[29:58] Christian
[30:00] Cristiano all we want to
[30:03] but you know at the end of the day
[30:06] it's uh the people that endure Sonos
[30:09] personas are the ones that obtain the
[30:12] price
[30:15] amen amen you know I don't think God
[30:18] called us
[30:19] uh you know because uh we were weak
[30:22] porque Ramos Devils amen amen I think
[30:25] that you may uh thought yourself as weak
[30:29] devil but God knew that you were strong
[30:33] you know I I the book of Isaiah chapter
[30:37] 53.3 yes it says it says this this I see
[30:41] it says therefore will I divide him a
[30:44] portion with the great and he shall
[30:46] divide the spoils with the strong
[30:50] partes
[30:52] so he thinks highly of him
[30:56] he thinks uh you know he thinks they
[30:58] they that you're strong
[31:00] you say well I feel weak
[31:04] but he's strong
[31:06] you see a lot of times you know you
[31:08] think you're weak
[31:10] because somebody told you
[31:14] or because you may feel me
[31:17] but he said you were strong
[31:20] you see and then we don't go by feelings
[31:23] here yeah
[31:24] we go by faith
[31:26] and if you have faith in God's words
[31:30] and he tells you you're strong
[31:33] you know the the song says
[31:36] let the week say I am
[32:13] a man you know brother Branham says this
[32:17] he says moving forward he says uh it's
[32:22] in the message Jesus Christ the same
[32:24] yesterday today and forever
[32:27] he says if you can only see that it's
[32:30] God's will to do these things for you
[32:38] it's God's will to save you all is
[32:42] God's will to heal you
[32:45] and he will certainly lead you into
[32:48] deeper depths and higher Heights
[32:55] if you'll just trust yourself
[32:57] it says don't be satisfied with your
[33:00] fire built here
[33:04] from last night
[33:06] he says let's build a little further up
[33:09] the road tonight
[33:12] this has never build it in the same
[33:14] place
[33:27] [Music]
[33:35] you know God has brought us this foreign
[34:13] and we think we made it foreign
[35:15] foreign
[35:53] wow he's like now I'm going to show you
[35:55] what what works does without faith
[35:59] and he started moving yours
[36:03] he started doing circles the other way
[36:13] he was in the same place
[36:42] which I believe faith is the father of
[36:45] words
[36:53] siento
[37:13] we are in a race Carrera
[37:17] and we want to win
[37:19] we want to obtain the prize
[37:22] you know and that's just the thing yes
[37:25] you see in in my line of work
[37:29] you know one of the greatest
[37:31] um one of the greatest mistakes people
[37:33] make
[37:36] is that when they're about to uh retire
[37:41] oh you know they are they stop they they
[37:43] begin to become careless
[37:47] important
[37:49] they just they're there they don't they
[37:51] don't watch out as much as they used to
[37:53] no secret
[37:55] you know and uh you know as as the year
[37:58] you know as the year ends
[38:01] as our Christian journey is is moving
[38:04] forward
[38:07] that's one of the things we have to
[38:09] watch out
[38:11] we have to uh we have to be careful
[38:15] as I began the the life of
[38:20] alignments
[38:22] I'm going to be honest with you
[38:24] I was scared
[38:27] I I was looking around
[38:30] not that everything was gonna kill me
[38:34] but you know it was the truth
[38:36] and as I began you know in my in my
[38:39] career
[38:41] I realized they did not everything was
[38:43] going to kill me
[38:45] and uh but you know when you get up
[38:47] there you'll be real careful
[38:50] when you're working on the hotlines
[38:55] exactly where you are
[38:59] you know and what the goal is you know
[39:03] what you have to accomplish
[39:05] you see uh because I I wanna I wanna
[39:09] last
[39:11] I want to be able to endure
[39:14] you see and and you know it wasn't it
[39:16] was
[39:26] you know I wonder if the Christian
[39:28] people haven't been mistreated
[39:33] I just I just want to let you know
[39:36] you may say I'm a Christian who said
[39:39] Cristiano and I haven't been mistreated
[39:42] well maybe you're you're you're hiding
[39:45] something
[39:46] maybe you're not even professing that
[39:48] you're a Christian Professor
[39:52] then you would get mistreated
[39:55] you see that make fun of you
[39:58] mock you said you may Professor
[40:04] but just because you professor professor
[40:07] does not mean that you possessed
[40:11] as soon as you Professor
[40:15] it's life-changing
[40:27] they're gonna they're gonna have to see
[40:30] what you're made of stuff
[40:34] and if it's only a profession
[40:38] it's not gonna last very long
[40:40] because you have to have the power
[40:44] to be able to help you
[40:49] see I see a lot there's a lot of
[40:51] Christian people
[40:52] they say they're Christians
[40:55] and as soon as soon as you make fun of
[40:58] them
[41:04] short-lived
[41:06] that's right
[41:10] it proved that he wasn't what he said
[41:13] yes
[41:23] and that's weak yes you see what he
[41:27] didn't call us
[41:36] [Applause]
[41:38] you know the funny thing is
[41:41] that's only the beginning
[41:44] that's just the beginning
[41:50] he's talking about horses here
[41:54] but long distance ones
[41:58] he says but oh how beautiful is a
[42:01] thoroughbred
[42:42] they don't go into any denominational
[42:44] arguments
[43:30] that is
[43:41] he's not looking at the United States
[43:47] [Applause]
[44:03] we start looking I'm keeping our eyes
[44:05] off of Jesus
[44:08] we start looking at the problems
[44:25] I'm not gonna go to church
[44:27] because the brother just said this about
[44:30] it is
[44:47] everybody has
[44:54] yeah
[44:56] they don't have Jesus
[44:59] that's right you may have problems
[45:03] everybody has problems
[45:08] that's right yes you see and we were
[45:11] very fortunate
[45:14] to be able to have
[45:16] him
[45:18] throughout our problems
[45:22] you know and with some of those synonyms
[45:26] of enduring
[46:25] amen amen
[46:27] Ephesians chapter six affects your says
[46:30] uh verse 13. it says they're this he
[46:34] says see it says word for take unto you
[46:36] the whole armor of God
[46:39] that you may able to be able to
[46:41] withstand in the evil days
[46:45] in having done all yeah
[46:49] uh two stands you see we gotta stand
[46:53] that time and not just do some no just
[46:57] to not do something
[47:00] but it says having done all but
[47:05] all things
[47:07] in order to stand but I start feeding
[47:10] this amen amen
[47:12] I just want to read a
[47:14] you know because this is this is a long
[47:16] journey
[47:19] you know and it's it's only for the
[47:21] strong yes
[47:23] that's that's the truth you know where
[47:27] we are we are not no somos called here
[47:30] we're not cooler horses
[47:37] that's right we're not us yes
[47:40] but that's not me
[47:48] by the blood of Jesus
[47:53] that's right
[47:57] that's what he calls
[48:03] and when you prefer Professor to be a
[48:05] Christian professor said Cristiano you
[48:08] better be ready to prove it
[48:10] I believe that we got Warriors here
[48:13] we got people personas they don't want
[48:16] to be handed the rewards
[48:20] that's right
[48:22] you know I don't know about you no say
[48:24] this they'll stand and I've said it I've
[48:26] said it I'll say it again
[48:28] that's something that that's given to
[48:30] you I'll go okay
[48:45] [Music]
[48:57] I wonder how good this is
[49:12] you get sick
[49:14] always
[50:14] uh
[51:20] you know but but the thing of it is
[51:24] what we have here look at the name
[51:27] this is six star esto is
[51:30] six stars there's nothing there is
[51:33] matter of fact I would say it's seven
[51:35] stars
[51:41] who gave us the seven messages
[51:59] if you take foreign
[53:00] Corazon
[53:19] Galatians 6 9.
[53:22] it says this is
[53:27] and let us not be weary in well doing
[53:30] for a due season we shall reap if we
[53:33] faint not no NOS cancer
[53:40] you know and that's that's something
[53:42] that I think we've all felt yes
[53:45] you know you felt the pressure
[53:48] you felt the pressure of uh
[53:51] maybe a new job
[53:55] or maybe a renewed walk with the Lord
[54:03] you know and uh
[54:05] maybe you haven't started again
[54:08] maybe you have a major decision
[54:11] oh but you know there are many times
[54:13] when we feel like fainting
[54:17] even when you're in church
[54:19] you know one of my uh favorite songs you
[54:22] know that means salmos Favoritos is uh
[54:25] Psalm 73. I said
[54:27] you know with uh the um with asaph the
[54:30] chief musician
[54:32] amen amen he wasn't just a musician no
[54:35] solo foreign but he was one of the chief
[54:38] because
[54:40] that's right yes
[54:43] it was like William
[54:45] you know he's the chief musician
[54:49] oh but you know uh when I read the psalm
[54:53] he started like this
[54:57] he says
[54:59] God is good
[55:02] always Siempre to Israel Israel you know
[55:07] even Even in our struggles
[55:10] Even in our problems oh God it's good
[55:14] it's always good
[55:17] it's good that we struggle as well
[55:21] the struggle is
[55:25] yes how about you know what God's real
[55:27] too
[55:31] strong
[55:41] he'll make himself
[55:43] when you stop playing around
[55:46] that's the problem one more time that's
[55:49] the problem playing around too much
[55:52] let's get real foreign
[56:21] you telling this guy she wants to marry
[56:23] him
[56:26] and then he asks
[56:29] why do you want to marry me

[1:00:00] all right
[1:00:01] we gotta be relentless
[1:00:06] that's right yes
[1:00:08] Relentless
[1:00:10] you know what religious means
[1:00:13] it means you can't sit still
[1:00:16] here the little kid always jumping
[1:00:18] around you know come on Nino
[1:00:26] when God has done something with it
[1:00:36] that is
[1:00:51] what you were called foreign
[1:01:05] all right
[1:01:08] he says this and he says
[1:01:12] and the last one that's cool
[1:01:14] he says that's the message I want
[1:01:17] him to bring for you and I assume
[1:01:22] oh your son his whole thoughts is upon

[1:01:43] he says I'd rather be just a little
[1:01:46] overzealous about the father's Kingdom
[1:01:48] than to have no Zeal at all for it
[1:01:58] says and as the Church of Christ
[1:02:00] preacher told me some time ago
[1:02:06] Mr Branham Senor Brandon I'd rather wear
[1:02:10] out in Russia
[1:02:13] and that is a lot of truth yes
[1:02:17] rather wear out and die in the harness

[1:03:53] we build
[1:03:56] however we're building
[1:03:58] the material that we're building
[1:04:01] we gotta be careful

[1:04:14] as individuals
[1:04:19] through the fire foreign
[1:04:51] El Fuego
[1:04:53] how we built commodificemos
[1:04:56] you know there's a story I want to close
[1:04:58] with
[1:05:03] about this uh farmer it says
[1:05:08] yeah
[1:05:09] he was in the agriculture business
[1:05:13] you know and uh
[1:05:16] he had a great desire one day
[1:05:21] you know uh everything that
[1:05:25] that he was uh
[1:05:27] that he desired
[1:05:30] he placed it in the in a
[1:05:33] but all his hopes and dreams in that in
[1:05:35] that seat
[1:05:40] amen amen it was a
[1:05:44] it was a bamboo tree and the Chinese
[1:05:46] bamboos what they call it bamboo
[1:05:52] and uh
[1:05:55] you know just like anybody
[1:05:58] I mean all of his vision
[1:06:01] everything that God had given him
[1:06:04] he placed it in those seats
[1:06:07] you know the word of God is the seed as
[1:06:09] well
[1:06:11] amen amen but they said you know that
[1:06:15] the seed it takes a long time
[1:06:20] you know for it to actually grow
[1:06:23] so in order for him to uh sustain his
[1:06:26] family
[1:06:28] you see he had to plant you know these
[1:06:31] other uh these other seeds as well
[1:06:34] you know but so in order for his family
[1:06:37] to eat
[1:06:38] but they said that he would you know he
[1:06:40] planted the seat
[1:06:43] all over the place foreign
[1:06:53] [Music]
[1:07:41] no your passes
[1:07:44] and you still see the same thing
[1:07:47] not only that
[1:07:49] so
[1:07:51] everybody tells you listening
[1:07:55] you're no different
[1:07:57] there's no change just give up that's a
[1:08:01] provencito that's what they tell us when
[1:08:03] we go to church
[1:08:05] there's no change
[1:08:17] he's a total failure
[1:08:20] and not only is he a failure
[1:08:23] but you're a failure too
[1:08:29] and it's discouraging yes the sanimante
[1:08:34] but when this farmer started this
[1:08:35] journey
[1:08:38] when he started the work
[1:08:41] he wanted to see it through
[1:08:45] he wanted to see it to the end
[1:08:48] two three years past
[1:08:51] still the same thing you see and the
[1:08:54] thing of it is
[1:08:55] those three years
[1:08:58] and every day of those three years
[1:09:02] he had to go water every hole
[1:09:05] every single home
[1:09:10] and it got to the point where his
[1:09:13] neighbors were laughing at him
[1:09:37] cuatro cincuanos
[1:09:40] and he was starting and he would just
[1:09:42] weep he would cry
[1:09:46] because he didn't see any fruit
[1:09:49] oh he saw was bearing ground
[1:09:53] oh he saw was the dirt
[1:09:58] but you know that fifth year came around
[1:10:03] and one day
[1:10:05] he went out there
[1:10:10] and there was a big scream you've owned
[1:10:16] he woke up the neighbors
[1:10:19] they woke up everybody that was around
[1:10:25] and
[1:10:27] the scene finally broke through
[1:10:30] [Music]
[1:10:31] it broke through after the fifth year
[1:10:37] and then everybody come around
[1:10:41] every seed that he had planted
[1:10:47] and then they came back the next day
[1:10:49] yeah grown five ten feet
[1:10:54] six weeks
[1:11:00] it hadn't grown in
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:19] did it grow
[1:11:22] in five weeks and Cinco semanas
[1:11:26] absolutely not absolutely no
[1:11:28] it grew in the five years
[1:11:31] they grew into five years
[1:11:34] the only problem was
[1:11:36] that nobody could see
[1:11:39] what was going on inside
[1:11:48] this is so much
[1:11:53] that's right
[1:11:55] it's not so important
[1:11:58] but it was the work
[1:12:04] that's much more important
[1:12:18] those were the lessons
[1:12:25] it's not so much what we can see
[1:12:28] results
[1:14:26] and you put it on this I
[1:14:52] they're not in vain
