[30:04] 73 Psalm
[30:08] 73 we'll read from verse 25 and
[30:13] 26 verse 25 to verse
[30:19] 28 Psalm
[30:24] 73 from verse 25 to
[30:26] 28
[30:39] whom have I in heaven but thee and there
[30:41] is none upon Earth that I desire beside
[30:50] thee My Flesh and my heart faileth but
[30:52] God is the strength of my heart and my

[31:08] Perish thou Hast destroyed all them that
[31:10] go a whing from

[31:23] says but it is good for me to draw near
[31:26] to God I have put my trust the Lord God
[31:29] that I may declare all thy
[31:31] works let us
[31:34] pray bless
[31:38] father we are here in this
[31:47] morning ready to draw nigh unto you
[31:53] Lord and see you closer to our
[31:56] lives
[32:00] be able to feel you touch you and hear
[32:03] you allow it to
[32:07] be bless your congregation
[32:13] here bless everyone seen us throughout
[32:15] the
[32:16] world help us in this
[32:19] morning may you be with
[32:22] us and may you move
[32:24] freely we thank you for all
[32:26] things in your holy precious
[32:29] name our Lord Jesus Christ
[32:32] amen may be seated
[32:40] brother we we are in the subject getting
[32:44] deeper with
[32:51] godber Titus began this subject with
[32:54] another
[32:56] subject that is drawing to
[33:01] God this morning brother guo and
[33:05] myself we titled our
[33:08] message draw
[33:11] closer draw
[33:14] closer and I'd like to read
[33:19] this as
[33:21] close but so far from
[33:26] Jesus and I want to take some words our
[33:28] brother Titus
[33:30] mentioned when he began this
[33:34] subject and these were a few of the
[33:36] words he
[33:38] said said
[33:41] brother what is between you and
[33:43] God an idol another God your job
[33:50] money lies
[33:53] sin what stands between you and
[33:56] God
[33:59] what's causing you to not feel him
[34:03] close today would be a good day to be in
[34:06] accounts with him and say God I feel you
[34:12] far sometimes I say my God we're so far
[34:16] from
[34:17] you maybe so
[34:20] far further than what we
[34:23] think we are further than what we
[34:26] think there in that Pew in this
[34:31] church you can feel very close to
[34:34] God or better
[34:37] said and brother Titus
[34:39] says the Devil Makes Us think that we
[34:43] are close to God but we are so
[34:48] far we think we're following
[34:50] him but we're so far from
[34:53] him and that's how it
[34:56] happens think we're close to
[34:59] God but in reality we're far from
[35:02] him everyone at some point in their
[35:05] lives we have fell far from
[35:08] God whether it be from a situation or
[35:12] problems
[35:14] distractions lack of
[35:16] time or simply just because we
[35:19] decide to act in our own lives and leave
[35:23] God out of our
[35:26] life that's what
[35:28] happens and The Devil Makes Us
[35:32] believe that we are close to God but in
[35:36] reality we're far from
[35:39] God and I want to take this
[35:42] character
[35:44] Judas
[35:47] Judas the scripture says in Luke
[35:51] 22 verse
[35:56] three
[36:02] then entered Sayan into Judah surname is
[36:05] carot being of number of the
[36:09] 12 now you
[36:11] know
[36:12] Judas is the one that delivers the Lord
[36:15] Jesus is the one that sells him
[36:19] out and Matthew 26 also
[36:21] reads verse
[36:24] 47 48 and 49 say
[36:28] and while yet he
[36:30] spake Lo Judas one of the
[36:35] 12 and with him a great multitude with
[36:37] swords and
[36:40] staves from the chief priests and Elders
[36:43] of the
[36:47] people now he that betrayed him gave
[36:50] them a sign
[36:54] saying whomsoever I shall kiss that's
[36:57] same as he hold him
[37:01] fast and for forth with he came to Jesus
[37:05] and
[37:06] said hail master and kissed
[37:09] him now look
[37:13] Judas a character that was so close but
[37:18] so far from Jesus was a
[37:21] man a man elected by
[37:24] Jesus to be part of his disciples
[37:28] he was used by
[37:29] God to glorify his name Judas walked
[37:33] with God With Jesus three
[37:36] years heard the sermons of
[37:39] Jesus heard the teachings of
[37:42] Jesus these teachings against
[37:45] lust against the hardened
[37:48] Hearts against
[37:51] luxury even so Judas betrayed Jesus
[37:55] selling him for a pile of coins
[37:59] Judas saw Jesus's
[38:02] wonders including when Jesus resurrected
[38:05] Lazarus Judas was also
[38:09] serving those
[38:14] baskets when they produced food for more
[38:16] than 500 people he was serving
[38:20] there he was giving and putting his
[38:23] time and even a day
[38:26] before Jesus was
[38:29] betrayed the other 11 disciples could
[38:33] never
[38:34] imagine that it would be
[38:36] Judas that would betray
[38:39] him what was most sure was that
[38:45] Judas couldn't show or you couldn't
[38:50] tell you couldn't tell that role of a
[38:54] someone that would betray
[38:55] him he could hide that that role very
[38:58] well because
[39:00] imagine if the other 11
[39:03] disciples could
[39:06] notice that Judas his intentions were to
[39:09] sell the
[39:11] master I imagine Peter would have
[39:14] reacted and would have beat
[39:20] him Peter had a high temper but
[39:24] Judas would hide this role very well
[39:28] now
[39:30] look Judas did not betray
[39:34] Jesus the day he kissed
[39:38] him one
[39:40] day one day after the Last
[39:45] Supper judas's
[39:48] fall judas's
[39:50] mistakes was not from one day to the
[39:53] next or it was not all of a sudden
[39:59] some time
[40:01] ago this man had been tempted by the
[40:04] devil and
[40:06] falling and what's
[40:08] worse is that he did
[40:12] nothing to stop what was happening
[40:14] inside him and that's how we are
[40:17] sometimes we know our own
[40:19] condition we know something's wrong with
[40:22] us but many times we don't do anything
[40:24] about it to stop that
[40:28] and we let it continue and we let it
[40:31] grow as our brother Titus said when
[40:34] we're in
[40:36] problems that's when we draw to God but
[40:39] while everything's okay we don't even
[40:42] remember about
[40:46] God sin comes to us draws us far from
[40:54] God sin drains the little of God that is
[40:57] in
[40:59] US s gets us caught
[41:03] up until we are slaves from
[41:07] ourselves because in Judas there was a
[41:12] process it was not all of a
[41:15] sudden it was not from night to morning
[41:19] it was a
[41:22] process he was in charge of
[41:25] money he was in charge of
[41:28] finances and
[41:30] sometimes he would take something from
[41:33] there he would
[41:35] steal so it was a
[41:38] process it was not all of a
[41:41] sudden but all of a
[41:44] sudden his heart would
[41:47] Harden unfaithfulness came
[41:51] out he began to separate and isolate
[41:55] himself he separated himself from life
[41:58] he separated himself from the
[42:01] truth Judas wasn't any type of
[42:04] person this man was a
[42:07] disciple elected by Jesus Christ he was
[42:10] part of the 12
[42:13] apostles but he wanted to lie to the
[42:16] truth and who is the
[42:18] truth the truth is the Lord Jesus
[42:21] Christ Judas tried to hide from the one
[42:25] that sees everything
[42:27] Judas walked
[42:29] with but his heart was far from
[42:34] him how many believe
[42:45] it so
[42:47] close but so far from
[42:52] Jesus when he betrays
[42:56] him
[42:58] with a
[43:00] kiss that was the
[43:05] sign then he
[43:09] repents but I don't think he repented
[43:11] from his
[43:14] heart to him more than anything it
[43:17] pricked his
[43:19] conscience to deliver innocent
[43:24] blood and this is where he
[43:28] I believe he did not repent from his
[43:33] heart because when he
[43:36] repents for delivering innocent
[43:40] blood how we
[43:42] say instead of putting your chest to the
[43:45] bull and facing
[43:48] reality to go and seek the
[43:51] Lord to go and seek the face of the Lord
[43:54] to go and be
[43:55] humble to go and ask for forgiveness he
[43:59] simply goes to these
[44:02] Pharisees returns their money he
[44:05] leaves and seeks the easiest
[44:09] way goes and commits
[44:12] suicide and that's how we are sometimes
[44:15] many times we fall maybe we
[44:20] fail instead of drawing closer to God
[44:23] it's not just about coming close but to
[44:26] get in
[44:27] be
[44:29] humble seek Jesus's face and ask him for
[44:33] forgiv many times we prer to choke
[44:37] ourselves
[44:42] spiritually yet here's another character
[44:46] Peter another
[44:49] man that also betrayed the Lord Jesus
[44:52] Christ
[44:54] Judas sold him
[44:58] and the
[44:59] Lord Judas sold him and Peter denied
[45:04] him but here's the difference between
[45:08] both both Apostles Walk With
[45:11] Jesus both Apostles sat at
[45:15] Jesus's both Apostles saw his
[45:21] wonders both Apostles saw the Miracles
[45:23] Jesus
[45:25] did both apostles ate with
[45:28] Jesus most Apostles laugh with
[45:31] Jesus but when the time
[45:33] came the most crucial moment was
[45:38] com that was a moment for the Lord Jesus
[45:41] Christ to die and be
[45:44] delivered after that last
[45:49] supper the Lord Jesus Christ went with
[45:51] the disciples to the Mount of jemane to
[45:55] pray and that's where Judas betrays
[45:59] him and takes these
[46:01] Pharisees they betray him and sell him
[46:05] you
[46:07] know
[46:08] then
[46:10] PA forgive me
[46:13] Peter also betrays
[46:15] him and he betrays him by denying him
[46:19] denies
[46:20] him both of them but the difference was
[46:24] this that Peter
[46:27] Knew by Revelation that Jesus Christ was
[46:32] the son of the Living
[46:34] God he could get
[46:36] close and seek Jesus's face he could be
[46:41] humble and ask for forgiveness look both
[46:46] of
[46:46] them to
[46:48] Judas the devil came inside
[46:52] him and I believe also came inside Peter
[46:57] the devil got inside
[47:00] him when the Lord Jesus begins to reveal
[47:03] to
[47:06] them it was necessary to return to
[47:10] Jerusalem to be
[47:13] crucified
[47:15] Peter takes
[47:18] some takes some on a on a walk and tells
[47:21] him don't do that avoid
[47:24] that that's when the Lord Jesus tell
[47:27] him apart from me
[47:30] Satan the devil asked for Peter to sift
[47:36] him but Peter had the Revelation he
[47:41] knew the one inside him is greater than
[47:44] the one in the world he knew that
[47:48] Jesus was the son of the
[47:51] living that was the
[47:54] difference it's necessary to draw closer
[47:57] to
[47:58] him see what brother brandham
[48:02] says the Devil is a real smart shrewd
[48:07] bird in the message the Third
[48:11] Exodus the devil is real smart shrewd
[48:19] bird he knows how to hit the thing
[48:21] before it gets started he knows it
[48:25] see
[48:29] and the only thing that you can ever do
[48:32] to beat him is rely on
[48:36] Christ and humble yourself and let him
[48:38] lead
[48:39] you
[48:42] see you'll never do it any other
[48:46] way your intellectual Powers will never
[48:49] do
[48:51] it you've got to believe
[48:53] it just rely on him he's the
[49:00] shepherd it ain't the Sheep's business
[49:02] to keep the wolf away it's the
[49:05] shepherd's
[49:07] business but the Sheep must stay with
[49:10] the
[49:10] Shepherd in order to stay
[49:13] safe that's my safety
[49:16] zone is in Christ and Christ is the word
[49:21] that's the safety zone
[49:24] Peter he knew Who The Shepherd of
[49:28] Shepherd
[49:29] was he knew it wasn't so much his
[49:32] business but he had to
[49:35] wait and only
[49:38] trust and that's how Peter
[49:40] did he
[49:42] waited Drew
[49:46] nigh he drew closer to him he humbled
[49:51] himself he sought the Lord's
[49:55] face
[49:59] in comparison to
[50:00] Judas
[50:04] Judas decided to take his own
[50:08] route he decided to do it his
[50:14] way he decided to take his
[50:18] life and it calls my attention what the
[50:20] scripture says
[50:22] here look
[50:25] after
[50:28] Judas betrays him with a
[50:32] kiss the Lord calls him
[50:38] friend I believe
[50:41] Jesus got to love
[50:44] Judas to call him a
[50:47] friend I believe he loved
[50:50] him because in the Lord Jesus
[50:53] Christ there cannot be anything else
[50:56] other than love
[50:57] but sometimes
[51:01] we betray
[51:04] him we betray what he's given
[51:07] us we betray every one of his
[51:10] blessings we betray his promises and
[51:14] even then he still loves us even then he
[51:17] still considers us
[51:19] friends we sell our
[51:22] time that time that should be
[51:25] his
[51:27] that time we should spend close to
[51:29] him we betrayed for a pile of coins but
[51:34] even then he calls us
[51:37] friend
[51:41] Brothers I believe he loves
[51:47] us let's draw closer to
[51:50] him draw closer to him let's be more
[51:55] humble there's nothing impossible for
[51:59] him if he could forgive even
[52:02] Peter after denying
[52:08] him but your attitude counts a lot
[52:11] also God bless
[52:14] [Applause]
[52:23] you
[52:25] amen
[52:27] [Music]
[52:29] we GRE you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:33] Christ there's no
[52:37] need why to be far from
[52:40] him if he is here with
[52:44] us I asked
[52:48] myself if the Lord Jesus
[52:50] Christ in his glorified
[52:54] body in any case came this
[52:57] morning cross those
[53:00] doors stand in this
[53:03] pulpit and would tell me
[53:06] son I will
[53:10] preach What attitude would we
[53:13] have what expect would we
[53:17] live how would we
[53:20] get of
[53:24] glad for myself I at least sit on the
[53:27] first
[53:28] bench and I would say Lord I want to
[53:31] hear
[53:32] you because you have what I
[53:36] need your word is
[53:42] life and there's really no reason why I
[53:46] live this morning our
[53:49] title draw
[53:53] closer draw closer to him
[53:59] invitation for you this
[54:04] morning the scripture says in Psalms
[54:10] 329 says a little blunt like
[54:14] this but it's the
[54:16] truth this is God's
[54:19] word be ye not as the
[54:22] horse or as the
[54:25] mule
[54:27] which have no
[54:29] understanding this is how we are
[54:34] sometimes whose mouth must be held in
[54:37] with bit and BR
[54:39] Britt bit and
[54:44] brittle who doesn't know who bit or
[54:46] brittle
[54:48] is it's it's a
[54:52] mouthpiece you put on the the horse or
[54:55] the mule
[54:57] so you can hold him from there so you
[55:00] can control
[55:02] it and the scripture says let us not be
[55:05] that
[55:06] way that we need a
[55:09] brittle we need a
[55:12] bit he can pull us towards
[55:17] him says
[55:21] L they come near unto
[55:24] thee many times times we
[55:27] need
[55:30] something like the preacher this morning
[55:33] said why
[55:36] wait why wait something come to
[55:41] you why wait for a bad
[55:45] news and be told you have
[55:50] cancer or you have so many days
[55:55] left that's a bit that's a brittle of
[55:58] the
[56:00] Lord many times he uses that to draw Us
[56:03] near
[56:04] him because we believe the Son of God if
[56:08] he is
[56:09] predestinated he cannot be
[56:12] lost sooner or later God will return
[56:18] you why go so
[56:20] far if he is so
[56:24] close he wants you to come to to
[56:27] him in such a
[56:30] way that you get much closer to
[56:34] him in such a
[56:40] way that you begin to rid of
[56:45] yourself the more you get closer to the
[56:50] Sun you begin
[56:54] to in in simple
[56:57] words I'm sorry you begin to
[57:05] melt I begin to disappear
[57:10] more and I begin to fuse a little
[57:16] more if we got close
[57:21] enough this flesh would
[57:25] dissolve and we would become
[57:29] him and that's the entire
[57:33] purpose that you get close
[57:37] enough so that this flesh melts or
[57:40] disolves that you let go of your
[57:44] desires you let go of your evil
[57:47] hearts that you begin to get close to
[57:53] him close enough that you see yourself
[57:55] in him
[57:58] I believe
[58:02] something that sooner
[58:05] later the
[58:08] worshipper turns into what he
[58:13] worships I repeat
[58:15] that the
[58:20] worshiper sooner or later will turn into
[58:22] what he
[58:24] worships you come to worship
[58:28] Him you surrender to Jesus
[58:31] Christ like the everything for
[58:34] you you dedicate your life to
[58:38] him sooner or later you will become
[58:42] him if you
[58:46] dedicate to your
[58:48] wife to
[58:50] women to the
[58:52] world sooner or
[58:55] later you will you will be with a lot of
[58:58] women if you dedicate to your
[59:02] job you devote to your
[59:08] job you get you dive into what you
[59:11] like sooner or later you will become
[59:16] that you become what you are
[59:19] worshiping I
[59:21] want to surrender to
[59:24] him enough brother
[59:28] I can become more
[59:31] like to be less like
[59:34] me less of me and more of him less of me
[59:40] and more of
[59:41] him that I
[59:44] wi so that he can grow in
[59:49] me the
[59:54] invitation that's why he prays in this
[59:56] tremendous prayer he
[59:59] makes John
[1:00:01] 1720 and he prays in this
[1:00:07] manner neither pray I for these
[1:00:10] alone for who the
[1:00:17] apostles for for them also which Shall
[1:00:20] Believe on me through their
[1:00:23] word who are they that's you and
[1:00:28] I the Lord is
[1:00:31] praying and say neither do I pray only
[1:00:33] for
[1:00:36] these but I pray for those that are to
[1:00:40] come he was praying for me
[1:00:43] brother he was praying for
[1:00:47] you and what is this
[1:00:54] prayer that they all may be
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:00] one as thou father in me are in me and
[1:01:06] I in
[1:01:08] thee Jesus says I and the father are
[1:01:14] one and in few
[1:01:20] words I was trying to find a word that
[1:01:22] describes
[1:01:24] this
[1:01:27] and what I found out is this word or
[1:01:29] term
[1:01:32] Fusion the word
[1:01:34] Fusion is a
[1:01:36] change of of
[1:01:40] state is changing from a solid
[1:01:44] state and then turns into a
[1:01:48] liquid and the best example of that it's
[1:01:52] like a
[1:01:53] glass you have a glass with
[1:01:58] he is the Water of Life Living
[1:02:02] Water many times we're like this cold
[1:02:04] piece of
[1:02:08] ice you deposit in the
[1:02:11] water what
[1:02:13] happens that ice
[1:02:16] cube that ice cube
[1:02:19] fuses joins with the
[1:02:23] water then they're no longer two
[1:02:27] now it's only
[1:02:30] one
[1:02:33] enough you got close
[1:02:36] enough submer in the
[1:02:38] water that you
[1:02:41] melt a little bit of few falls off every
[1:02:46] time you get closer to
[1:02:48] him there's less of
[1:02:51] you and you begin to reflect him more
[1:02:56] [Applause]
[1:02:58] [Music]
[1:03:00] I don't know if this excites you a
[1:03:03] little because he's already
[1:03:08] here why live far from
[1:03:11] him the scripture
[1:03:20] says that they also may be one in
[1:03:24] US
[1:03:27] that in
[1:03:28] them who's them that's
[1:03:32] us this is the prayer Jesus
[1:03:37] is that you and I can be one with
[1:03:41] them that's what the scripture
[1:03:44] says because he and the father were
[1:03:48] one and he says let them be one with
[1:03:52] us for
[1:03:54] what
[1:04:02] um that the
[1:04:04] [Music]
[1:04:06] world may believe that thou has sent
[1:04:09] me did you
[1:04:13] understand there's a purpose a reason
[1:04:16] why Jesus is
[1:04:19] praying and he wants you to be one with
[1:04:22] him and he says for what
[1:04:26] so the world can
[1:04:31] believe the only way the world will
[1:04:33] believe that he did
[1:04:36] come is that he be through
[1:04:40] you the people cannot
[1:04:43] believe he came and
[1:04:46] resurrected when you are not one with
[1:04:52] him you are not close enough to the word
[1:04:56] or you haven't ate the
[1:04:59] word and you have not become
[1:05:04] word because when you come to the
[1:05:07] word and you eat of the
[1:05:10] word you become
[1:05:13] word and that's Jesus's
[1:05:17] worry that he wants us to come to this
[1:05:21] un that we draw close enough to him that
[1:05:25] we can become
[1:05:27] one so the world can believe in
[1:05:33] him there's no other way amen
[1:05:38] amen that's the
[1:05:47] reason when Earth gets close
[1:05:50] enough to the
[1:05:54] Sun
[1:05:56] it produces
[1:05:58] life don't fall asleep brother stay
[1:06:03] here when the
[1:06:06] earth we see that easily in
[1:06:10] Colorado we have
[1:06:13] winter everything is dead and
[1:06:17] dry but once the Earth
[1:06:21] spins and gets closer to the
[1:06:24] Sun closer to the
[1:06:28] Sun Life blooms again amen
[1:06:33] amen that's why we are
[1:06:37] lifeless that's why we are fruitless
[1:06:39] many
[1:06:42] times because we're not close enough to
[1:06:47] him but why don't you get close to him
[1:06:49] this
[1:06:50] morning why not get more
[1:06:53] closer a little bit more brother
[1:06:56] get closer to him he won't reject
[1:07:01] you our Pastor
[1:07:06] said even when Adam
[1:07:11] sinned God did not miss his
[1:07:16] appointment he keeps coming to
[1:07:19] you why
[1:07:22] Brethren because he simply loves us so
[1:07:26] we are his
[1:07:28] children he comes to
[1:07:31] us maybe the condition wasn't the
[1:07:34] best and he began to
[1:07:38] flee because his sin pricked
[1:07:42] him that's why you don't get close
[1:07:46] sometimes but I don't think there's such
[1:07:48] a great sin that my God can't
[1:07:53] forgive you know at the end of
[1:07:57] accounts the
[1:07:59] problem the problem I see
[1:08:01] here we want to impress
[1:08:05] god with
[1:08:08] works with something that I can
[1:08:12] do but you cannot impress
[1:08:15] God Jes impressed him for
[1:08:21] me Jesus impressed him for me
[1:08:27] he already did
[1:08:38] everything the grade that we can give
[1:08:42] Jesus when God calls
[1:08:45] Jesus and see Jesus's
[1:08:48] grades A+ and he sees A+ everywhere A+
[1:08:54] just A+ everywhere
[1:08:57] Jesus's
[1:08:59] great are
[1:09:02] mine in other words when I get to
[1:09:05] heaven and they call
[1:09:08] me show me his
[1:09:11] grace let me tell you I have an
[1:09:14] A I have straight
[1:09:17] A because I don't have to
[1:09:20] impress he impressed him for
[1:09:23] me all I have
[1:09:27] get a little
[1:09:29] closer a little closer
[1:09:31] brother
[1:09:33] so you
[1:09:37] fuse you join with
[1:09:41] him does the scripture not
[1:09:44] say he is the
[1:09:48] life he's the
[1:09:52] vine we are the branches
[1:09:59] inserted from the
[1:10:02] vine so I was a wild
[1:10:06] Branch but when I joined the
[1:10:11] vine part of the
[1:10:13] Vine I am
[1:10:16] him that is
[1:10:18] Unity that he is searching
[1:10:22] for if we get close enough
[1:10:26] we become one with
[1:10:28] him you come to be
[1:10:30] him that's why in
[1:10:34] adoption says when the son becomes
[1:10:39] adopted when the son becomes adopted
[1:10:42] brother
[1:10:44] William he can sign the check oh
[1:10:47] hallelujah oh
[1:10:48] [Applause]
[1:10:50] Hallelujah because his signature is as
[1:10:53] good as the father
[1:10:56] father belongs to the
[1:10:58] son he becomes one with the
[1:11:03] father that is
[1:11:07] adoption his signature is as good as the
[1:11:11] father's you cannot dive into the water
[1:11:14] and come out
[1:11:16] dry you get in the water and come out
[1:11:22] wet you cannot get in with a
[1:11:24] supernatural
[1:11:27] and keep being
[1:11:29] fleshly you become
[1:11:33] Supernatural if you truly draw to him
[1:11:36] your
[1:11:38] nature will be his
[1:11:46] nature you cannot come to the Holy
[1:11:52] Spirit you cannot come to the Holy
[1:11:54] Spirit
[1:11:56] and continue being
[1:11:58] caral if you get close to the Holy
[1:12:01] Spirit you become
[1:12:03] spiritual and
[1:12:06] holy if you are
[1:12:09] caral you have not gone close
[1:12:12] enough come to him this
[1:12:15] morning get a little
[1:12:20] closer if you get close to the word you
[1:12:22] become
[1:12:24] word
[1:12:26] the worshipper becomes what he worships
[1:12:29] amen
[1:12:32] amen that word
[1:12:35] Fusion or that you are
[1:12:40] one is described in 2 Corinthians
[1:12:47] 3:18 but we
[1:12:53] all with open face beholding as in a
[1:12:58] glass the glory of the
[1:13:07] Lord are changed into the same image
[1:13:10] from glory to
[1:13:13] glory the more you admire
[1:13:16] him the more you see his
[1:13:19] glory you are being
[1:13:22] transformed to what you are seeing
[1:13:27] reflect like a
[1:13:29] mirror and when you see the
[1:13:32] mirror I don't see
[1:13:34] myself I see
[1:13:38] him when you get close enough to him and
[1:13:42] become one with him the people see
[1:13:47] you people can see Jesus
[1:13:51] walking and you are one with him
[1:13:56] so whatever you
[1:13:57] say that
[1:14:00] happens we can make
[1:14:03] worlds God said let there be
[1:14:08] light and there was
[1:14:11] light why because he is
[1:14:15] [Music]
[1:14:16] God if the light never came then God
[1:14:19] never
[1:14:21] spoke but when God speaks things happen
[1:14:26] he said let there be
[1:14:28] light and there was
[1:14:32] light but my question is if we are his
[1:14:36] children if we are God's
[1:14:39] children what are
[1:14:43] we aren't we also
[1:14:47] creators no aren't
[1:14:49] we are we
[1:14:53] creators you can create the right
[1:14:56] atmosphere or the wrong
[1:15:00] atmosphere and this morning you
[1:15:02] decide where you're headed where do you
[1:15:06] want to
[1:15:07] go what do you
[1:15:09] desire the decision is put before
[1:15:14] you this morning you can make the
[1:15:16] correct
[1:15:18] atmosphere for you to obtain your new
[1:15:22] birth we are creators
[1:15:28] we can make a
[1:15:30] world and go live in
[1:15:33] it that's what the prophet
[1:15:38] said we can make a world and go live in
[1:15:42] it many times that's what I've
[1:15:47] done you know when things aren't going
[1:15:53] smooth Maybe life circumstances have led
[1:15:56] us to have many
[1:15:59] problems full of
[1:16:01] illnesses full of
[1:16:03] problems and there we
[1:16:07] are but the Son of God has power to make
[1:16:10] a world and go live in it by faith
[1:16:15] brother everything around you is
[1:16:18] falling and I come and make my own
[1:16:22] world and I say everything is well
[1:16:26] where I
[1:16:27] am everything is
[1:16:30] well maybe around
[1:16:32] me the circumstances are difficult but
[1:16:36] I've made a
[1:16:38] world by the faith I've been given and
[1:16:41] I've gone to live in there and that's
[1:16:43] where I am in Heavenly places with
[1:16:47] Christ
[1:16:48] Jesus there I
[1:16:51] hide inable Rock nobody move me
[1:16:56] there nobody can take me out of there
[1:17:00] nobody because I myself have made
[1:17:04] that because of what I
[1:17:08] believed and it's
[1:17:10] scriptural you say brother that's a
[1:17:13] lie do you remember
[1:17:18] Elisha Elisha lived in a different world
[1:17:21] Jessie Jesse could not see
[1:17:26] and he said we're
[1:17:28] surrounded we're surrounded we're
[1:17:31] finished the case is
[1:17:36] over and the prophet Elisha
[1:17:40] Rises Lord Open the Eyes of My
[1:17:44] servants so that he can
[1:17:48] see is next to
[1:17:51] us if he is with us
[1:17:55] who can be against
[1:17:58] us why do you keep running away from him

[1:18:05] him there was a man reading his
[1:18:09] Bible and theologians came and asked him

[1:18:22] doing this man maybe barely knew how to
[1:18:26] read and he said I'm reading the
[1:18:30] Bible and they were very arrogant and
[1:18:33] asked
[1:18:34] him and what are you reading
[1:18:37] fellow in other words you don't even
[1:18:41] understand he said I'm reading the book
[1:18:43] of
[1:18:45] Revelation and they said oh well you
[1:18:48] believe do you
[1:18:50] understand can you explain that to
[1:18:53] me he said
[1:18:57] well all that I
[1:18:59] understand that at the
[1:19:02] end we
