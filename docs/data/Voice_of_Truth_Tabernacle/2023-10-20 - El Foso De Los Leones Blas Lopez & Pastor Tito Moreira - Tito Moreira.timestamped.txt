[30:53] the Lord Jesus
[30:56] Christ

[31:01] amen I believe the Lord is
[31:04] here
[31:06] why because you are here
[31:11] Brethren I can see God in
[31:16] you and I believe we are a thankful
[31:20] people when we come to worship the king
[31:22] of King and Lord of
[31:26] lords reading the words just as we're
[31:31] standing we'll be reading in chapter
[31:33] five of The Book of
[31:35] Daniel we'll continue with the biblical
[31:39] characters and you know our character is
[31:45] Daniel let's read from verse one and
[31:49] on and it
[31:56] says
[32:00] Bazar the king made a great feast to a
[32:02] thousand of his Lords and drank wine
[32:04] before the
[32:24] [Music]
[32:26] thousand
[32:30] Bazar whilst he tasted the wine
[32:32] commanded to bring the golden and the
[32:34] silver vessels which his father
[32:36] Nebuchadnezzar have taken out of the
[32:38] temple which was in Jerusalem that the
[32:40] king and his princes his wives and his
[32:43] concubines might drink
[32:48] [Music]
[32:56] therein
[33:01] then they brought the golden vessels
[33:02] that were taken out of the Temple of the
[33:04] house of God which was at Jerusalem and
[33:06] the King and his princes his wives and
[33:08] his concubines Drank in them let us pray
[33:13] brother blessed loving Heavenly
[33:17] Father Lord we come before your
[33:20] presence we have read your word
[33:23] Lord your word is
[33:25] true your ways are
[33:29] just help us in this evening
[33:33] Lord may your word have an
[33:35] effect every one of
[33:38] us that we not leave
[33:41] empty
[33:44] Lord you that are the king of
[33:48] glory help us treasure your word
[33:53] Lord help this word Lord
[33:58] manifest in our
[34:00] lives that we testify Lord that there's
[34:03] a living God and a
[34:06] God that continues to
[34:09] work same yesterday today and
[34:12] forever you thanks
[34:15] Lord Jesus
[34:18] Christ you may be seated
[34:24] brother we're going to speak a little of
[34:26] this feast
[34:30] but before I would like to tell
[34:33] you I believe
[34:35] that as the Bible
[34:37] says he was a man with a
[34:40] purpose Danel had a purpose in his
[34:45] heart I don't know what purpose you came
[34:47] to
[34:49] church if you came to receive from
[34:54] God or you just came to be
[34:58] seen because many times
[35:01] brother we don't come to church with an
[35:04] expectation it doesn't matter who's
[35:07] preaching God's word
[35:10] brother it's living and
[35:15] edifying at least one word has to have
[35:17] an effect in our
[35:21] hearts and to say Lord if I've let you
[35:25] down if I something
[35:28] wrong in this evening I
[35:31] want to ask for forgiveness to please
[35:35] you that's why I'm here to serve
[35:38] you because this Daniel
[35:41] brother I believe he wanted to serve
[35:45] God the time he was in
[35:48] Babylon he did not mix himself with
[35:52] people what he did was he was a man of
[35:55] Prayer he pray three times a
[35:58] day he trusted in
[36:01] God he
[36:08] knew he knew God who delivered him from
[36:10] those people
[36:13] that we see since the
[36:16] beginning how
[36:18] Nebuchadnezzar got to
[36:21] Jerusalem and besieged
[36:23] it there was
[36:25] war
[36:27] and there was many
[36:31] casualties but they brought the
[36:34] people to
[36:36] Babylon
[36:38] Jerusalem who is
[36:42] Jerusalem Jerusalem is the city of the
[36:44] great God how many believe
[36:47] that Jerusalem is
[36:49] Holy anyone that curses
[36:53] Jerusalem will be
[36:55] cursed who blesses
[36:58] Jerusalem will be
[37:01] blessed that's what I believe with all
[37:03] my
[37:05] heart Luke
[37:08] 17e
[37:10] says I like it because the
[37:14] prophet and my brother Fidel I remember
[37:16] he read
[37:19] it the law and the prophets were until
[37:24] John since that time the kingdom of God
[37:26] is
[37:28] and Every Man Press into
[37:30] it so this is an
[37:35] effort lie
[37:37] brother is an effort you are an
[37:41] overcover today I believe you were an
[37:43] overcomer
[37:45] today not here because brother BL was
[37:48] going to preach I believe but that's
[37:50] what God wants
[37:52] it a privilege and a pleasure to be here
[37:55] along with our pastor
[37:58] a great pleasure
[38:01] brother Matthew 11:12
[38:12] says from the days of John the baptis
[38:14] until now the kingom
[38:15] of violence take it by
[38:18] force how many violent Hallelujah
[38:22] brother these are the on that
[38:25] God
[38:29] there's a
[38:30] reward for all of these
[38:33] Brave Revelation
[38:38] 3:21 this is not just overcoming
[38:43] now every day of
[38:45] service at our
[38:48] homes
[38:51] wherever share God's word the prophet
[38:55] said a true
[38:58] fellow through God's wordu Hallelujah
[39:04] brother it says to him that overcometh
[39:06] will I grant to sit with me in my
[39:08] throne even as I also overcame and I'm

[51:04] presence now this is a a living
[51:08] testimony now is the
[51:10] time to be in accounts with the
[51:13] Lord the balance is still
[51:16] set and God is weighing
[51:19] us because the prophet
[51:22] says the devil counts his own
[51:28] when you see a big multitud say the
[51:30] church is prospering but
[51:32] no God weighs the spirit he weighs his
[51:37] own and he knows what caliber you're
[51:39] made out of my time is over
[51:42] brother I'm G to let our
[51:45] pastor come and God bless
[51:53] you amen
[51:56] please stand for a
[52:01] moment let's read chapter six of Daniel
[52:04] now
[52:06] Daniel Daniel
[52:11] 6 we'll be speaking on the
[52:18] lion might have seen in a cartoon or a
[52:23] movie or you've read it
[52:27] I'm not going to read the entire
[52:31] chapter but we know it's about
[52:34] Daniel that's who we're talking
[52:39] about this scripture takes
[52:44] place after the kingdom of Babylon is
[52:49] removed and conquered by Persian
[52:54] MS
[52:59] and now it says that they Place Daniel
[53:01] as one of the
[53:05] governors it pleased Darius he was the
[53:07] king of the Persian
[53:16] mes to set over the kingdom and 120
[53:20] princes which should be over the whole
[53:24] Kingdom
[53:27] and over these three presidents of whom
[53:30] Daniel was
[53:31] first now
[53:37] notice there was 120 presidents let's
[53:41] say over all the
[53:43] king it was not only just one country it
[53:47] was many
[53:49] countries
[53:51] 12 over those
[53:54] countries
[53:56] and over those
[53:57] 120 there were three
[54:00] men and one of them was
[54:08] Daniel that the princess might give
[54:11] accounts unto them and the King should
[54:13] have no
[54:24] damage
[54:28] [Music]
[54:30] then this Daniel was preferred above the
[54:32] presidents and princes because an
[54:34] excellent Spirit was on him and the King
[54:36] thought to set him over the whole
[54:39] realm you may be
[54:42] seated now let's dive into the lions
[54:46] den that's where we want to want to get
[54:49] to
[54:54] hopefully we want to introduce Daniel
[54:56] here again and how he made it to the
[54:58] lies
[55:00] Den now the Bible tells us in verse
[55:09] three that Daniel was preferred above
[55:12] presidents and
[55:14] princes
[55:17] because an excellent Spirit was in
[55:21] him it was not his intelligence
[55:26] what made him
[55:29] special although he was very
[55:31] intelligent it was not his
[55:35] riches it was not his
[55:39] knowledge something different inside him
[55:41] from the
[55:43] rest God's children are different from
[55:45] everyone
[55:46] else I don't understand
[55:50] today how we want to be the same like
[55:52] everyone
[55:54] else
[55:55] Daniel didn't care to be the same like
[55:57] everyone
[56:01] else Daniel was happy being different
[56:03] from the
[56:05] rest what made him
[56:09] better what made him stand
[56:12] out it wasn't his knowledge the Bible
[56:17] says the spirit that was in
[56:20] [Music]
[56:22] him what put him in that position
[56:27] what lifted him to such a
[56:31] point was that he was a spiritual
[56:36] man youth don't be afraid to be
[56:39] spiritual over your
[56:42] education over your
[56:45] knowledge over your status your friends
[56:49] seek to be
[56:52] spiritual what took Daniel to where he
[56:54] was
[56:58] was was that he was a man that had
[57:00] communication with
[57:03] God he knew what worship
[57:07] was they looked for
[57:11] him not just because of his
[57:15] knowledge but because he could interpret
[57:19] Visions because God spoke to
[57:22] him in the previous chapter
[57:26] the chapter brother Blas
[57:30] read we know that Bazar calls Daniel and
[57:34] says
[57:38] Daniel I've heard that God listens to
[57:41] you oh hopefully the people can
[57:45] know that God listens to his children
[57:49] let me tell
[57:50] you God listens to his
[57:53] children start tells
[57:56] Daniel Daniel I
[57:58] heard that you can interpret
[58:01] dreams that you speak with
[58:04] God he looked for him because he spoke
[58:07] with
[58:09] God that's what had him in that
[58:13] place because he was a spiritual
[58:16] man don't be afraid of being
[58:19] spiritual they offered him
[58:23] everything
[58:25] I'll dress you with fine
[58:27] cloth I'll give you this I'll give you
[58:32] that I'll make you the third in the
[58:36] kingdom and Daniel says I don't care
[58:38] about any of
[58:40] that I don't care what you can
[58:43] offer all I want is what God can give
[58:47] me that's the type of man Daniel
[58:50] was he was a praying
[58:53] man he was a spiritual
[58:57] man verse four
[59:15] says then the presidents and princes
[59:17] sought to find occasion against Daniel
[59:19] concerning the kingdom but they could
[59:22] but they could find none occasion nor
[59:24] fall for as much as he was faithful
[59:26] neither was there any error or fault
[59:28] found in
[59:42] him then said these men we shall not
[59:44] find any occasion against this Daniel
[59:46] except we find it against his concerning
[59:49] the law of his
[59:51] God in other
[59:53] words
[59:57] we have to do something against his
[1:00:02] religion we have to do something against
[1:00:04] his Devotion to
[1:00:06] God that's the only way we'll make
[1:00:09] Daniel
[1:00:10] stumble what do they do they went to the
[1:00:13] king and told the king
[1:00:17] king there is none like
[1:00:20] you there's none like you
[1:00:23] King everyone to honor
[1:00:28] you and no one ask anything from any
[1:00:31] other
[1:00:32] God for 30
[1:00:36] days for 30 days that no one ask
[1:00:39] anything from any other
[1:00:41] God I'm I'm sure they
[1:00:46] imagined that Daniel would not stand 30
[1:00:49] days without praying to
[1:00:52] God their surprise was that he couldn't
[1:00:54] even stand a couple
[1:00:56] hours without being with his
[1:01:00] God the King was in
[1:01:06] agreement and it says in verse 10 now
[1:01:09] when Daniel knew that the writing was
[1:01:12] signed he went into his house and look
[1:01:16] watch
[1:01:18] Daniel watch what a courageous
[1:01:23] man now when knew that the writing was
[1:01:26] signed he went into his house and his
[1:01:29] windows being open in his
[1:01:31] chamber toward
[1:01:35] Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees
[1:01:37] three times a
[1:01:41] day and prayed and gave thanks before
[1:01:43] his
[1:01:45] God as he did a four
[1:01:48] time now look
[1:01:52] here Daniel did this all the time this
[1:01:56] was his
[1:01:59] custom before he went to the Lion's
[1:02:02] Den he was
[1:02:07] prepared because he had communication
[1:02:09] with
[1:02:12] God he didn't start praying when he got
[1:02:15] to the Lion's
[1:02:17] Den he prayed every
[1:02:20] day three times a
[1:02:23] day
[1:02:25] number one I believe he prayed so many
[1:02:29] times because he knew he needed so much
[1:02:31] from
[1:02:34] God in an unknown land let's
[1:02:38] say let's say he was with
[1:02:42] foreigners with different uh strange
[1:02:46] Traditions he had been there for a long
[1:02:48] time but I
[1:02:51] imagine just like it is
[1:02:53] today as time
[1:02:56] passes the trials get
[1:02:59] tougher and we need
[1:03:01] God not once a
[1:03:05] week not three times a
[1:03:08] week every
[1:03:12] moment couldn't wait a
[1:03:14] day without his
[1:03:18] God I believe in the place he
[1:03:21] was he
[1:03:23] recognized
[1:03:24] need from his
[1:03:27] God May there be people
[1:03:30] today that
[1:03:32] recognize the great
[1:03:35] need of God in their
[1:03:38] lives there's youth brothers that
[1:03:41] there's adults and fathers parents that
[1:03:46] recognize that we can't
[1:03:49] survive with just coming to
[1:03:52] church no I need him
[1:03:56] every
[1:03:57] moment without him I
[1:04:04] can't number
[1:04:07] two I believe he prayed three times a
[1:04:09] day to his
[1:04:14] God following what Solomon
[1:04:18] said in First
[1:04:22] Kings chapter8
[1:04:26] and
[1:04:27] on
[1:04:29] Solomon many years
[1:04:32] before many years before
[1:04:34] Daniel King
[1:04:36] Solomon the king of
[1:04:40] Israel he dedicated a temple to
[1:04:45] God and while he dedicated his
[1:04:48] Temple the glory of God came
[1:04:53] down
[1:04:55] and I believe the prayer he made was
[1:04:57] anointed by
[1:05:03] God and now he speaks of the symbol or
[1:05:05] significance of the
[1:05:07] temple the temple was in
[1:05:10] Jerusalem and he says in verse
[1:05:14] 46 if they sin against
[1:05:18] thee for there is no man that how many
[1:05:21] can acknowledge
[1:05:23] this
[1:05:24] how many Sinners are in
[1:05:27] here there are some that maybe need to
[1:05:30] lift two
[1:05:31] hands maybe two
[1:05:38] feet if they sin against
[1:05:41] thee and thou be angry with
[1:05:44] them and deliver them to the
[1:05:48] [Music]
[1:05:51] enemy so they can carry them away
[1:05:53] captives unto the land
[1:05:55] of far or
[1:05:58] near now notice
[1:06:01] here what happened with Daniel and
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:09] Israel yet if they shall bethink
[1:06:11] themselves in the land whether they
[1:06:13] shall were carried
[1:06:20] captives and repent and make
[1:06:22] supplication unto thee in the land of
[1:06:24] them that carried them
[1:06:26] captives saying we have
[1:06:29] sinned and have done
[1:06:32] perversely we have committed
[1:06:37] wickedness and so return unto thee with
[1:06:39] all their
[1:06:40] heart and with all their
[1:06:43] souls in the land of their
[1:06:46] enemies which led them away
[1:06:53] captive
[1:06:54] and pray unto thee toward their land
[1:06:56] which thou gavest unto their
[1:07:03] fathers the city which thou H has chosen
[1:07:06] and the house which I have built for th
[1:07:09] name it says then hear thou their prayer
[1:07:12] their suppli in heaven thy dwelling
[1:07:15] [Music]
[1:07:19] place and maintain their cause notice
[1:07:25] Daniel knew this
[1:07:27] scripture Daniel
[1:07:30] knew thaton prayed one
[1:07:34] time when this Temple was in his
[1:07:37] glory glory of the Lord filled this
[1:07:41] Temple and he believed in Solomon's
[1:07:45] words that if they were carried
[1:07:49] away Daniel was carried captive but if
[1:07:53] they
[1:07:55] turned their
[1:07:57] face the city of
[1:07:59] Jerusalem although it was far from
[1:08:02] them although they could not
[1:08:05] see although they couldn't see
[1:08:08] it although the city was in
[1:08:12] ruins the temple in
[1:08:16] rues were not destroyed hallelujah
[1:08:20] hallelujah
[1:08:22] brother the temple
[1:08:25] Promises of God were
[1:08:28] faithful there was a man that believed
[1:08:31] them that man was
[1:08:33] Daniel he believed God's
[1:08:38] promises and he open his
[1:08:41] windows to face
[1:08:44] Jerusalem to pray towards
[1:08:47] Jerusalem he wasn't challenging anyone
[1:08:51] that was his
[1:08:52] life that was his C
[1:08:55] life trying to be
[1:08:59] seenly his Devotion to God

[1:10:04] captive how
[1:10:07] tremendous how
[1:10:10] tremendous Daniel was a witness of this
[1:10:15] scripture he could testify and
[1:10:20] say I have kept God's word
[1:10:24] I stood up for God's
[1:10:26] word he has stood up for
[1:10:31] me for they be thy people and thine
[1:10:35] in which thou broughtest forth out

[1:11:05] prayer maintained
[1:11:07] him he maintained in the faith of
[1:11:13] God that they took everything away from
[1:11:16] him I believe he
[1:11:20] prayed because it was something they
[1:11:22] couldn't take away
[1:11:24] they took his friends
[1:11:25] away they took his
[1:11:28] family they took his land away they took

[1:12:27] the gossipers came and told the
[1:12:32] king and the King could not
[1:12:44] retract then the King which he heard

[1:13:18] changed then the king commanded and they
[1:13:21] brought Daniel and cast him in the of
[1:13:24] lions now the king spake and said unto
[1:13:29] Daniel thy

[1:13:36] continually he will deliver
[1:13:44] thee verse 17 says and a stone was
[1:13:47] brought and laid upon the mouth of the

[1:25:05] time you can't see
[1:25:08] the she will be
[1:25:21] there God's provided way at the end
[1:25:25] time says
[1:25:26] Daniel for the cause of
[1:25:29] God was thrown into a lion's
[1:25:33] den he needed a
[1:25:36] fence but God sent him an
[1:25:39] angel what a
[1:25:42] difference that was God's provided
[1:25:45] way he needed a
[1:25:47] f but God gave him an
[1:25:51] angel
[1:25:53] you say brother I need my
[1:25:56] healing I need
[1:25:58] money I need this I need
[1:26:01] [Music]
[1:26:03] that only God knows what you
[1:26:06] need God knows what you
[1:26:09] need he will send what you
[1:26:13] need he says what a better fence it
[1:26:17] [Music]
[1:26:21] was
[1:26:24] better than you ask
[1:26:27] for anyone that can say Amen to
[1:26:30] this he always gives you
[1:26:34] better than what you ask for hallelujah
[1:26:37] hallelujah oh hallelujah
[1:26:41] hallelujah something better for
[1:26:44] you something better for
[1:26:51] you God gave Daniel something
[1:26:56] better I
[1:26:58] imagine that all of a
[1:27:06] sudden the growlings from the Lions
[1:27:09] those groanings
[1:27:15] groanings turn into
[1:27:21] snoring
[1:27:26] all of a sudden all the lions were
[1:27:33] still God didn't take him away from the
[1:27:40] problem but gave him a
[1:27:44] security in the
[1:27:50] problem I think Daniel that at
[1:27:54] night slept like no other
[1:27:58] night I believe he slept like a
[1:28:02] baby I believe that
[1:28:05] day he realized safest place he could
[1:28:11] be because a safe
[1:28:14] place
[1:28:16] isn't a specific
[1:28:19] location a safe place
[1:28:22] is God's
[1:28:24] love I repeat that the safe place is not
[1:28:29] a
[1:28:30] location it's not to have money it's not
[1:28:34] to have
[1:28:35] healing not that your body is healthy
[1:28:38] the safe
[1:28:40] place God's
[1:28:43] love God loves
[1:28:48] you if it's in a belly of a whale
[1:28:53] as long as he
[1:28:54] loves I am
[1:28:57] safe if it's next to a
[1:29:01] lion but as long as he loves
[1:29:04] me I am
[1:29:06] safe his
[1:29:08] love is my
[1:29:11] safety his
[1:29:13] love is what gives me
[1:29:16] peace I don't have money I don't have
[1:29:19] what I
[1:29:20] want rest
[1:29:23] have I have his
[1:29:26] love
[1:29:27] church is there someone
[1:29:30] here can
[1:29:32] say that's where I want to
[1:29:42] be I
[1:29:44] imagine that Daniel
[1:29:48] said never have I felt this safe
[1:30:05] he needed a fence and God sent him an
[1:30:09] angel God gave him something
[1:30:13] better he gave him an
[1:30:20] assurance he gave him and
[1:30:24] Assurance Blessed
[1:30:27] Assurance everything is
[1:30:30] well nothing is
[1:30:32] impossible it seems
[1:30:35] impossible but for
[1:30:37] God nothing is
[1:30:43] difficult gave him of his love
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:48] oh gave him of his presence
[1:30:54] gave him of his
[1:30:58] spirit all of a sudden Daniel
[1:31:02] looked said I've never felt this
[1:31:08] [Music]
[1:31:15] safe imagine he found a spot next to
[1:31:18] those
[1:31:20] lions
[1:31:27] simply put himself in
[1:31:30] the God's
[1:31:36] love he was
[1:31:40] sleepy he was not
[1:31:42] [Music]
[1:31:44] worried a brother from the
[1:31:47] message that is in Israel
[1:31:50] now

[1:31:54] said the god of Israel does not
