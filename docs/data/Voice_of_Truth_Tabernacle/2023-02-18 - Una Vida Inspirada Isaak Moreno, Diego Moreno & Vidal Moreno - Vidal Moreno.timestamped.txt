[27:23] [Music]
[27:31] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[27:36] amen I mean they're happy to be in the
[27:38] house of the Lord
[27:42] how many youth came prepared amen
[27:46] amen this is our youth service amen amen
[27:54] um
[27:55] that's why um to tell you the verse that
[27:57] we'll be reading today
[28:01] if you could go with me to Ruth too
[28:07] and we'll be
[28:09] um reading verse two and three on
[28:11] Saturdays
[28:17] amen Ruth two
[28:19] chapter two
[28:21] verse two and three a man
[28:26] amen and our title for today is
[28:30] an inspired life amen
[28:33] amen
[28:37] amen for our Lord Jesus Christ
[28:40] amen and it says like this
[28:46] Naomi let me go out into the Harvest
[28:49] Hills to pick up the stocks of grain
[28:51] left behind by anyone who is kind enough
[28:53] to let me do it Naomi replied all right
[28:56] my daughter go ahead
[29:10] so Ruth went out to gather grain behind
[29:14] behind the Harvesters and as it happened
[29:16] she found herself working in a field
[29:18] that belonged to Boaz the relative of
[29:21] her father-in-law eliminally foreign
[29:59] foreign
[30:35] and I was reading and reading the
[30:38] background of these times
[30:41] and in these times there was a lot of
[30:45] mail it was a male
[30:49] male dominated in these times
[30:55] women or the woman didn't really have
[30:57] much to they couldn't really say
[30:59] anything
[31:01] a lot of them if they didn't have
[31:03] husbands they were poor muchas
[31:07] we see that Ruth went to go gather green
[31:12] behind the Harvesters
[31:16] and as we know her her husband had
[31:19] passed away
[31:21] as and she didn't have any children
[31:24] so in that way she was most likely poor
[31:27] so
[31:29] she was trying to survive
[31:33] see and we see that she went with Naomi
[31:36] I mean
[31:38] and Naomi told her it was fine
[31:41] that she could go out into the fields
[31:44] and and go get her food that she needed
[31:49] and we see that she she didn't she asked
[31:53] for Naomi's advice
[31:57] and we see that she was not used to
[32:01] doing this
[32:04] you see she had left her home behind
[32:07] yeah
[32:08] this was a new custom to her Nuevo
[32:12] costume she was following someone else's
[32:14] culture
[32:17] everything was new to her
[32:19] we see that she had to come out of her
[32:22] comfort zone
[32:26] um
[32:26] and she had to she had to learn new ways
[32:33] if we keep on reading
[32:36] we see that once you got out of her
[32:38] comfort zone
[32:40] and she started Gathering her food
[32:44] we see that Boaz noticed her I mean
[32:49] and he asked who is who is this girl
[32:55] and they told her a truth
[32:58] and we see if we keep reading
[33:02] it says
[33:05] he tells them
[33:08] to have her coming in
[33:12] and we see that she got noticed by Boaz
[33:16] [Music]
[33:18] and we see that she ate with Boaz
[33:22] we see that the Harvesters that told her
[33:26] or that allowed her to pick the food
[33:31] that she got priorities after them
[33:35] you see when we get out of our comfort
[33:37] zone
[33:39] God could do marvelous things in
[33:41] marvelous ways
[33:44] he can do something in your life quick
[33:49] you see it could have been about a
[33:51] two-hour space
[33:54] because she went to go pig
[33:57] and then Boaz noticed her
[34:00] and he said bring bring her and have her
[34:03] eat
[34:05] and if we keep reading
[34:09] and she still had leftovers
[34:12] so you see if we just let God work in
[34:15] our lives
[34:16] God could bless us so quickly
[34:19] we just
[34:23] gave ourselves to him
[34:39] amen but you see we see some people that
[34:42] have nothing
[34:44] you see sometimes we don't have very
[34:47] much amen
[34:48] you know we try to appear like we have
[34:51] something
[34:53] and you know I want to go to Romans 3
[34:56] 23.3
[35:00] you see
[35:02] it says for all have sinned and fall
[35:05] short of the glory of God Amen
[35:11] you see all of us have fallen shorts
[35:14] all of us have come short on dreams
[35:19] have come short on goals
[35:23] on our purpose
[35:24] and we have fallen short a lot of times
[35:28] and a lot of times while we fall in
[35:30] shorts
[35:32] It's because we're just spectating amen
[35:36] we're just Spectators
[35:39] of everyone else we have dreams we have
[35:43] goals
[35:45] we have our purposes
[35:47] but a lot of the times we're just on our
[35:49] social media
[35:53] socialism
[35:57] and we're just looking at other people's
[36:00] lives amen
[36:08] how their goals are being accomplished
[36:10] their dreams
[36:14] their purpose but we're just still
[36:18] sitting on our bed
[36:21] and we're wondering why we're sad amen
[36:24] we're wondering we're wondering why we
[36:28] can't grow amen
[36:30] a lot of times you don't do nothing
[36:33] because we're trying to preserve things
[36:37] what are we preserving in reality
[36:41] we don't have nothing in the first place
[36:45] so we're really not preserving anything
[36:48] We're just trying to preserve our bodies
[36:51] I guess
[36:54] but we're not preserving anything amen
[36:57] and you see a lot of times why we don't
[37:00] get out of our comfort zone
[37:03] it's because we don't want to take risk
[37:06] amen
[37:08] and if we
[37:10] um
[37:10] you know we have to take risk in our
[37:13] lives
[37:15] we have to get out of our comfort zone
[37:17] and do something with our lives
[37:20] my dad was sharing with me
[37:24] a quote that he heard
[37:26] and he said you know if you don't want
[37:29] to risk anything or have or have a a
[37:33] life you know
[37:35] have a life that's going to be enjoyable
[37:40] then would you you could just sit in a
[37:42] corner
[37:44] we'll give you uh
[37:46] three or we'll give you food there
[37:51] um you could stay there
[37:53] there'll be no risk
[37:55] just stay in your corner
[37:58] and you might live to be 80 100 years
[38:00] old
[38:02] but what kind of life will that be
[38:05] at the end of the day what are people
[38:08] gonna say about you
[38:09] [Music]
[38:11] that you were comfortable in your corner
[38:16] that you didn't accomplish anything
[38:18] you just
[38:21] accomplished to live 80 100 years old
[38:26] whatever age you you were able to get to
[38:28] or
[38:30] what kind of life would that be amen
[38:33] [Music]
[38:35] you see and I want to read this quote
[38:37] from Brother Branham
[38:40] I don't have it there
[38:43] it's just in English
[38:45] um but it says now notice the perverted
[38:48] the perverted life
[38:50] the devil inspiring it
[38:53] that's that life becomes miserable
[38:58] I've never seen it in all stages from
[39:01] the rich to poor
[39:06] I've had the privilege
[39:08] of being in King's palaces
[39:12] from that to the lowest huh on Skid Row
[39:18] I've never seen a Content a Content a
[39:22] contented sinner in my life
[39:25] that's right there's no happiness or
[39:28] contentment outside of Jesus Christ
[39:33] I've seen the I've seen them so rich
[39:36] every Los vistos so they have bodyguards
[39:39] with them
[39:45] and I've seen them so poor till they've
[39:47] begged for a drink of whiskey
[39:53] and from the one to the other there's no
[39:57] satisfaction yeah
[40:02] then what do they call that life
[40:07] how could you call it life when you want
[40:09] to take it
[40:12] it's not life and he says this now if
[40:17] the devil can't get you to to do
[40:19] something like that
[40:22] he's done something else
[40:25] now listen use he will let you be a
[40:29] gentleman
[40:30] and you'll pay your honest debts
[40:35] you'll treat your neighbors right
[40:39] he even says this you'll even join
[40:41] Church it's
[41:10] so joining church is not life
[41:15] singing hymns is not life
[41:18] preaching the gospel is not life
[41:22] only one way you can have life
[41:26] that's to know him
[41:28] you don't know
[41:30] and have Life by knowing
[41:33] knowing of the of your church
[41:37] you don't have Life by no in the Bible
[41:42] Life by knowing Christ
[41:48] is
[41:50] the only way that you can have life
[41:57] we can't just come here to church
[42:01] we can't just read our Bible
[42:03] we can't just talk about the words
[42:06] and have life
[42:09] we have to actually know Jesus Christ
[42:12] we have to be born again amen
[42:16] because if we don't we don't have life
[42:20] amen we're dead amen amen and I would
[42:24] like to read another quote
[42:29] um Sita thank you
[42:31] earnestly content for the faith
[42:35] [Music]
[42:38] preacher in 1955
[42:40] [Music]
[42:41] and it says being rich yet become poor
[42:45] is
[42:49] that through his poverty we might be
[42:52] made Rich
[42:59] no rich in Heavenly blessings
[43:03] spiritual things
[43:06] we who were once poor Nosotros
[43:10] now become rich through his poverty
[43:16] Progreso amen you see property is a
[43:19] state of mind
[43:22] could have stayed in her property
[43:25] you see but something within her
[43:28] will not allow her to stay there amen
[43:31] she was willing to come out
[43:35] I learned something new
[43:38] you see she even went to boaz's fee if
[43:41] we keep reading
[43:44] and she uncovered her his feet
[43:49] and I I believe that was something
[43:51] really rare for her
[43:53] [Music]
[43:55] when Naomi told her to do that
[43:59] someone would have told me to do that
[44:02] I would have been like you're crazy
[44:05] but we see that she trusted Naomi I mean
[44:10] and she trusted in Boaz amen because Bo
[44:14] as we see he was a well-respected man
[44:18] as well he respected amen
[44:21] he didn't do anything with Ruth
[44:25] but you see Ruth got out of her comfort
[44:27] zone
[44:29] and we see that God blessed her when she
[44:32] came out of here
[44:34] you see we see this story
[44:37] and I was listening to a message earlier
[44:40] and you see a lot of us think this is a
[44:43] story of love
[44:48] they got married and everything
[44:50] [Music]
[44:51] but this is a story of redemption
[44:55] this is a story of them being redeemed
[44:58] amen
[44:59] see Ruth was just trying to survive day
[45:02] to day
[45:04] and you see Naomi was gonna have to do
[45:08] the same thing
[45:10] if they would have been redeemed amen
[45:14] if Bruce would have gotten out of her
[45:16] comfort zone
[45:18] they would have barely been surviving
[45:20] amen
[45:22] and you see a lot of times
[45:28] come to our minds and especially as
[45:31] youth especially yes and we don't want
[45:33] to get out of our comfort zone amen we
[45:37] don't want to sing a special we don't
[45:39] want to raise our hands amen we don't
[45:42] want to sing because we don't want want
[45:44] to get out of that comfort zone
[45:46] we're too scared of what other people
[45:48] are going to think of us
[45:51] what other youth might think okay but
[45:55] why not be a leader amen why not make a
[45:58] movement amen what if you raise it in
[46:00] your hands
[46:04] makes your neighbor raise their hands
[46:06] make sure neighbors say amen amen what
[46:10] if it helps them grow amen because
[46:14] like I've said before
[46:17] Spirits are contagious amen
[46:20] and if we could have a good spirit
[46:22] that can be contagious in this church
[46:26] and we could be a contagious
[46:30] in a good
[46:33] spirits I believe God could move within
[46:36] us amen
[46:39] amen amen and that's all I had for
[46:42] tonight
[46:46] amen God bless you
[46:53] foreign
[47:25] amenities like this is
[47:28] he that observeth the wind shall not sow
[47:31] and he that regardeth the cloud shall
[47:34] not reap El caliento Observer
[47:40] amen we're speaking on an inspired life
[47:45] amen I believe Ruth is a perfect example
[47:48] of that amen
[47:50] Perfecto amen and I particularly want to
[47:54] focus on risks
[47:57] amen because I believe that to live an
[48:00] Inspired Life
[48:02] you have to take risks
[48:06] as my brother before me said
[48:09] you have to get out of your comfort zone
[48:11] sometimes
[48:14] amen so Ruth had to take risks
[48:18] and many times we we have a negative
[48:21] attitude towards risks
[48:26] foreign
[49:27] amen I can personally relate with that
[49:33] um I wasn't raised here
[49:36] um and moving from from a different
[49:38] place isn't easy
[49:41] amen so she she moved from a foreign
[50:26] foreign
[50:32] amen amen and I really like something
[50:35] that my brother Isaac said
[50:37] he said that if you could live a
[50:39] risk-free life then that is
[50:45] and he says that but what kind of a life
[50:48] would that be
[50:50] I like it I like to take it a step
[50:52] further
[50:53] if you could live off risk-free life and
[50:56] be successful
[51:00] then would you do it I know that I would
[51:03] remember
[51:05] if I could live a successful life
[51:10] um then I would absolutely do it
[51:13] amen but unfortunately
[51:21] everything requires something uh
[51:26] in order to obtain something
[51:29] if you go over to a restaurant and you
[51:33] order some food
[51:34] and you pay for it you risk being
[51:38] disappointed
[51:40] if you cross the crosswalk at an
[51:43] intersection
[51:49] semaphroa
[51:51] um if you cross the crosswalk you risk
[51:53] getting run over here
[51:55] so my point with this is
[51:58] wrists are everywhere
[52:01] and then to some extent yes
[52:04] you have control over the risk that you
[52:06] take
[52:09] amen amen
[52:13] praise be to God
[52:16] amen as a preacher you can prepare so
[52:18] much and then the time comes and
[52:20] everything goes away
[52:26] amen amen
[52:29] you just be patient with me trying to
[52:32] find myself
[52:41] amen amen
[52:45] amen so I asked myself
[52:48] kind of looking at Ruth you know
[52:51] um she had already endured so some heavy
[52:54] losses
[52:56] I mean she lost her her soulmate her
[52:59] husband
[53:01] they probably didn't have any food there
[53:03] was famine in in her in her town
[53:09] so I asked myself like why
[53:13] why would she go go out of her way to go
[53:16] to a place she never been to okay
[53:21] because I think that Ruth had a greater
[53:24] purpose
[53:26] and having her belly filled
[53:30] amen I believe that it's because of Ruth
[53:34] that we're here amen
[53:37] she's in the lineage of the Lord Jesus
[53:39] Christ
[53:41] amen so I believe that she was a
[53:44] mediocre okay
[53:46] there's something inside of her that
[53:48] drove her to bigger and better things
[53:50] than men
[53:53] hey man I don't think that she could
[53:55] live another day
[53:56] I don't think that she could live
[53:58] another day
[53:59] in the same city
[54:02] with the same routine
[54:04] yielding the same results
[54:11] amen and many times I ask myself
[54:14] why why don't I see results in my life
[54:18] amen it seems like every day I try
[54:21] harder
[54:23] and every day I backtrack
[54:27] it seems like I try to serve God with
[54:29] all of my heart
[54:31] and I want to do great things for his
[54:33] kingdom
[54:35] sure that we all do
[54:37] amen and so I asked myself why don't I
[54:40] see a change
[54:42] why does it seem like the harder that I
[54:44] try
[54:45] kygo
[54:50] amen I think that the answer to that is
[54:53] that because you choose to live a life
[54:56] for God is
[55:00] that you choose to wake up every day
[55:05] knowing that you might fail
[55:07] and fail more the next day
[55:10] and more the next day after that
[55:13] and each day maybe you seem to become
[55:16] more of a miserable sinner amen
[55:21] amen but one one thing that I found
[55:24] while I was studying a little bit
[55:26] was that when you take risks
[55:29] if you take the right attitude
[55:32] correct it's a win-win situation
[55:36] amen you can take the risk
[55:39] and two things can happen
[55:41] you either
[55:44] a get the the you take the risk and you
[55:47] get the desired outcome amen
[55:50] la la
[56:05] because sometimes I think that it's
[56:07] either failure or success
[56:12] I'm beginning to realize
[56:15] that failure is a part of success
[56:20] without a success would be incomplete
[56:24] without it success would be incomplete
[56:29] amen amen
[56:38] amen
[56:40] how many want to take risks
[56:44] amen
[56:47] praise be to God
[56:49] and when I ask myself
[56:54] what would have happened had Ruth not
[56:56] gone
[56:58] how would she have ended up
[57:02] and then I looked at orpha and orpha was
[57:06] only mentioned twice in the Bible
[57:09] after that nobody heard nobody heard of
[57:12] her
[57:14] amen I asked myself
[57:17] amen and I realized that nobody
[57:20] remembers Ordinary People
[57:23] say it again nobody remembers Ordinary
[57:25] People
[57:29] amen I don't think God has any Ordinary
[57:31] People amen
[57:35] amen I don't think that we've ever heard
[57:38] of a man or a woman
[57:41] who lived an ordinary life
[57:44] and did remarkable things
[57:47] I mean it wasn't the person who sat on
[57:49] the couch
[57:52] it wasn't the person scrolling through
[57:54] their social feed amen not for that
[57:56] person I've been pursue it wasn't the
[57:59] person who didn't uh decided not to try
[58:01] hard in school
[58:03] or the person who settled for an eight
[58:05] to four job amen
[58:09] amen nobody remembers those types of
[58:12] things
[58:13] because those people are just like
[58:15] everyone else
[58:17] amen and I'm beginning to realize and I
[58:21] see it in my father every day
[58:23] is that if you want people to remember
[58:27] you have to be remarkable uh
[58:32] you have to be relentless
[58:40] amen and I think that Ruth displayed
[58:43] this perfectly
[58:45] because she has something that set her
[58:47] apart from everyone else
[58:50] amen it was her risk-taking
[58:55] it was her drive amen
[58:58] her work ethics
[59:00] the amount of work that she accomplished
[59:04] amen the Bible says that she only rested
[59:06] for a little while now because it's
[59:08] working
[59:10] and I imagine that that day that maybe
[59:12] Shia worked some of the guys that were
[59:14] working there amen
[59:19] amen personally I believe that it was
[59:22] Ruth's work ethics
[59:26] yielded the extraordinary results in her
[59:29] life amen
[59:38] and it really impacted me it says like
[59:41] this he says you can't accomplish a
[59:44] Million Dollar Dream he said
[59:47] on a minimum wage
[59:51] now that really speaks to me amen
[59:54] because everybody dreams big amen
[59:57] amen but does everybody work as hard
[1:00:01] amen and that that really speaks to me
[1:00:04] just because sometimes I I have these
[1:00:06] wild dreams
[1:00:09] you know I say I'm an accomplished
[1:00:12] amen I have it in my mind I even write
[1:00:14] it down sometimes
[1:00:16] remember the plan doesn't start when you
[1:00:19] write it down
[1:00:21] the plan starts when you actually start
[1:00:23] acting yeah
[1:00:25] amen and if you want if you want
[1:00:28] something in this life is
[1:00:30] we
[1:00:32] maybe Church isn't for you
[1:00:34] amen I hope it is I really do yo yo is
[1:00:38] remember I don't think that God wants us
[1:00:40] to be miserable either
[1:00:43] amen so I think that we should just be
[1:00:46] honest with ourselves sometimes
[1:00:49] amen but if you want something in this
[1:00:51] life
[1:00:52] if I can leave you with anything
[1:00:56] I'm just gonna make a little
[1:00:58] illustration
[1:01:00] say that you want a bag of chips at the
[1:01:02] vending machine
[1:01:08] and they're worth 1.50
[1:01:11] you put a dollar in is you can't expect
[1:01:15] to get the bag of chips
[1:01:17] you fall short like
[1:01:21] so if you have a dream
[1:01:23] if you have
[1:01:25] any ambition in this life
[1:01:28] make sure that your work ethic lives up
[1:01:31] to the dream
[1:01:32] say
[1:01:37] and then otherwise you always come up
[1:01:39] short amen
[1:01:42] amen God bless you
[1:01:47] foreign
[1:02:22] foreign
[1:02:36] unto thy mother-in-law since the death
[1:02:38] of thine husband
[1:02:40] this is
[1:02:45] [Music]
[1:02:49] assistant
[1:03:01] and thou has left thy father and mother
[1:03:03] in the land of thy Nativity and are
[1:03:06] coming to a people which is our newest
[1:03:07] not heretofore
[1:03:10] the Lord recompense thy Work and the
[1:03:13] full reward be given thee of the Lord
[1:03:15] God of Israel under whose wings Thou Art
[1:03:17] come to trust
[1:03:23] it will remuneration
[1:03:37] and we're talking about an Inspired Life
[1:03:41] you know and uh you know when we uh we
[1:03:44] talk about you know an Inspired Life
[1:03:48] I think when we talk about life in
[1:03:50] general
[1:03:52] and see uh there's there's only uh two
[1:03:55] ways of doing things I believe
[1:04:00] you could do it the easy way
[1:04:04] or or you could do it the hard way
[1:04:08] that's what I believe yeah I believe
[1:04:11] that uh We've we've chose the the latter
[1:04:14] joke
[1:04:16] then we've we've chose the the the the
[1:04:19] second thing
[1:04:20] is
[1:04:24] amen amen you know because when we are
[1:04:28] when we all look at roots
[1:04:30] and uh you know the the efforts that
[1:04:33] that she made
[1:04:35] you know oh it's it's very easy it's
[1:04:39] very easy to to uh be uh be critical
[1:04:44] critical you know on on uh especially
[1:04:47] yeah you know when when when you ain't
[1:04:51] doing nothing
[1:04:52] you know I I heard a I heard a quote and
[1:04:56] I really liked it
[1:04:59] and it said you know they don't make a
[1:05:01] statue for critics
[1:05:05] you know there's a lot of people you
[1:05:09] know there may be star rules
[1:05:11] you know and they saw her take action
[1:05:15] no and what she was doing
[1:05:17] this she's crazy
[1:05:28] she's gonna throw her life away
[1:05:31] I wonder if they don't say that about us
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:31] the only way you can eliminate that down
[1:06:36] amen
[1:07:19] [Applause]
[1:07:36] ah man you know the way God starts
[1:07:38] something
[1:07:40] that's the way he finishes it is
[1:07:46] and he's gonna end it the same way
[1:07:49] brother
[1:07:53] he says take Faith rather and apply the
[1:07:56] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:05] by faith to the heart's door
[1:08:07] it says this was going to separate and
[1:08:10] make the difference between those who
[1:08:12] were going out of Egypt and those who
[1:08:15] were going to stay in Egypt and perish
[1:08:17] with Egypt
[1:08:20] difference
[1:08:27] and I like what he says here
[1:08:31] it made the difference
[1:08:35] that the blood made the difference
[1:08:39] that's what the difference was
[1:08:42] that's what the sign was
[1:08:49] the blood of Jesus Christ that's gonna
[1:08:53] make the difference
[1:08:55] you know we were cold here
[1:08:58] no we were not called here
[1:09:01] just to be good Christians
[1:09:05] you see the thing of it is
[1:10:05] above average results
[1:10:29] but you can maybe average I'm
[1:10:50] [Music]
[1:11:31] that's what I said will you
[1:11:55] hold on
[1:11:57] I thought you said screaming dreaming
[1:11:59] okay
[1:12:04] Glory
[1:12:09] we don't want to just be uh dreamers
[1:12:14] you know dreams
[1:12:16] you have dreams at night
[1:12:20] that's right that's the yes but Dreams
[1:12:24] they're not made at night
[1:12:28] Dreams Are Made during the day Los
[1:12:31] sueños
[1:12:35] that's right dreams are not made at
[1:12:38] night
[1:12:41] you can have a dream of nights
[1:12:47] and you live in the same life
[1:12:50] it was just a
[1:12:54] dreams our dreams are made during the
[1:12:57] daytime
[1:13:09] want to let you know it's up to you
[1:13:14] to make that happen as well
[1:13:18] do you know when rules when Ruth goes
[1:13:22] back to Bethlehem
[1:13:25] but when she goes there
[1:13:28] she could have went to any Fields
[1:13:33] that's right
[1:13:36] and you have your choice
[1:13:40] there's good Fields out there
[1:13:43] Fields out there in the world
[1:13:46] pick whatever you want
[1:13:49] they're good
[1:13:51] but they're not good enough for me
[1:13:58] I want you to notice
[1:14:04] she goes to the field
[1:14:27] you can
[1:14:30] this was a Field of Dreams
[1:14:34] ah it was the field of Grace in El Campo
[1:14:38] De Gracia and it was a field of
[1:14:40] abundance
[1:14:41] here was a field of forgiveness
[1:14:56] for whatever you need father look you
[1:14:58] stand necessity
[1:15:01] whatever you need
[1:15:04] that field has it is
[1:15:14] I want you to notice
[1:15:18] she didn't just go stand there in the
[1:15:20] field
[1:15:22] just go sit in the field
[1:15:26] but she want to go work in the field
[1:15:30] she went to go work
[1:15:35] and when she started working
[1:15:39] the owner of the fields
[1:15:42] he noticed
[1:15:45] when you start working for God
[1:15:48] he's gonna notice yes
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:22] [Music]
[1:16:26] that's right brother
[1:16:28] yes he does
[1:16:32] the harder you push huh
[1:16:39] you know the more people
[1:16:42] you uh tend to leave behind sometimes
[1:16:49] the harder you push
[1:16:53] the more people you leave behind
[1:17:01] that's right we agree with that cuantos
[1:17:04] de cuerdo
[1:17:06] people don't want to work
[1:17:10] that's right brother

[1:17:40] you know the harder you push
[1:17:43] the more you work
[1:17:47] the higher you go
[1:17:52] the more people step back
[1:17:57] they said that guy is crazy
[1:18:02] he's gone too far
[1:18:07] he's taking it to another level
[1:18:13] you know when they start criticizing
[1:18:16] you know the way they do
[1:18:20] you know and the reason is
[1:18:23] is that the you know they don't want to
[1:18:26] put in the work

[1:41:59] that he never comes in debt with someone
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:19] every moment
[1:42:26] that I have surrendered to him
