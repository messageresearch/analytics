sent a Prophet by the name of William Mariam Bram William Bram in our day Lord Lord me myself I have not seen the prophet but Lord we have someone here who has seen the prophet there's been many people Lord in the generations that passed Lord many of them have gone beyond and Lord and only a few handful of them are still here with us but as the scripture say says blessed are those that have not seen but yet they believe Lord help us Lord in this evening we placed all of this in your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen you may take your seats um and in this evening we we have a a very special sister her name is sister Sharon Johnson Sharon Johnson um how many know sister Sharon Johnson Sharon okay there's still a couple of hands that didn't raise their hand you know and I'm going to be a little bit Qui honest you know I'm a bit ignorant some some things and uh I really didn't knew who the sister was I knew there was something special about her and um and I remember when brother Steve Robson came here to speak and he mentioned sister Sharon Sharon and he said that uh I I forgot how he said it but he say but she has something to do with brother brandham and I said I got to talk to this sister no time went on and I never had a chance to talk to her but we we had that special Minister from Africa brother Thomas and we're having our Thanksgiving dinner and I'm talking to brother Thomas sister Sharon approached the table and she wanted to share something with brother Thomas and I said this is my opportunity right here once she's done talking to the brother I'm going to I'm G to ask her and well then I right there with all the people that were there in the table with us I asked sister Sharon sister Sharon I I I remember brother Steve said this can you please share with me what what happened with with your testimony and she told me there was a little correction there and uh what brother Steve said but she started to share her testimony with brother Bram and I'm going to let her say it of course but one thing that I asked sister Sharon I asked her one question when she was done I said sister Sharon Sharon I said can there's words to describe how was it the presence of brother brandham when you were there with him what was that presence and she looked at me and and it looked like she wanted to cry and made me want to cry and and I said that presence of that moment what I just felt I'm pretty sure that's how it felt like and the only thing that in my mind that as I I was there in that table after asking that question I said Lord my prayer is that I want to have that same presence just when people when they knew when brother Bram walked in that Auditorium when brother brandham walked in the room and they all said that brother Bram had a presence with him and I said man I would I would love to have a presence that presence inside of me it's not me it's not brother brandom it's Jesus Christ incarnated in you that when you walk in the room and he said that's a child of God right there that's a Son of God that's what I want to be known as child of God not as someone who had a bad testimony oh you're known because of this he's known because of that no I want to be known that he is a child of God um how many your expectation you I I let's pray for her that she can say everything that that's in her heart God open up her memory and you just open up your heart you just pull it just pull it out of her let's pull on God's gift and so we can be blessed by it um one little thing here uh sister Sharon uh we last night we went me and brother Josh we went to go picked up her piano she's going to sing a song for us and she gave us this this this paper here I believe her and her husband uh did this right here and it's a list of meetings that brother brandom held and Phoenix Arizona Phoenix now she has it here with color but unfortunately we don't have it with color just black and white uh we're going to have this located in the Vesti and if you can just take one take one per family it shows you all the addresses and the messages where brother Brandon preached and if if we run out of copies uh just feel free talk to the secretary brother Eli or a minister or any Deacon and and we'll sure to get you a copy of of this of this here amen how many of you love the Lord amen if sister Sharon can can please come forward uh let's pray for her and and we're really blessed to have her here with us um as she was was telling me her testimony I I really Rejoice by it and she has a couple of pictures too and uh and she'll be sharing those as well um we're so glad for that [Music] amen amen and that's why we read those scriptures that Elijah Elijah was a man on to like Passions what does that mean that Elijah was a man just like you and I he laughed just like you and I he had favorite he had a favorite food just like you and I he joked just like you and I clean jokes he was human but he was God's Prophet amen s Sharon Sharon amen see I'm G have to turn this off and turn it on again this song I'm GNA sing I know all of you have heard the story that brother brandom tells about the little lady out on the [Music] rant in and the wealthy man from backi sent his son out to find a bride and that that message that story brother Brenham told inspired these words to me and my grandson played with this piano so I'm trying to set it where I want it and I'm not getting it very well but we'll I'll just I can't I won't something is not right there we [Music] [Music] go there was a little Maiden on a ranch Way Out West she didn't look real modern like her cousins who had the best she had to work for her living toiled and worked all the time and though Oho tired and weary she kept this thought in mind what's that I see coming down a dusty road it looks just like that Buckboard coming to take me home he promised me he'd come for me I believed it all along that long wait's almost over real soon now I'll be gone you see a man had passed her way he came traveling from the East he came searching for a little bride to take with him to a marriage Feast he found in her a character that suited him quite well and he promised her he'd return for her into a mansion they'd go and dwell and she says what's that I see coming down a dusty road it looks just like that Buckboard coming to take me home he promised me he'd come for me I believed it all along that long wait's almost over real soon now I'll beun days turned into the weeks the weeks turned into months the months went on into a year she didn't waver no not once her cousins all around her laughed and made such fun of the thought that he'd return for her oh we know it won't be done but she sings what's that I see coming down a dusty road it looks just like that Buckboard come to take me home he promised me he'd come for me I believed it all along that long wait's almost over real soon now I'll beone now that long wait's almost over her heart is beating fast the signs he told her to watch for are taking place at last she knows that soon she'll be on her way with her bridegroom ever to be to go to that Mansion he's prepared to live eternally and she sings what's that I see coming down a dusty road it looks just like my bridegroom coming to take me home he promised me he'd come for me I believed it all along that long wait's almost over real soon now I'll be gone thank you I'm scared of death but um I've been asked to do this and uh I I I didn't want to I I I was a wreck about it but I prayed about it and there's a lot of people that didn't have the privilege that I'd had and I told myself I wasn't going to do this I don't want to overemphasize the re relationship that our family had with brother brandham I mean it's not like we were best friends and back and forth but neither do I want to minimize it because it was the greatest honor to be in his me meetings to have him in our home to breathe the same air in in in the room with him it wasn't blessing and not just him his children grandchild it was an honor so I was born in Long Beach California Long Beach California and raised in the Los Angeles area a little town Wilmington wilington went to a little Pentecostal Church there and we went to church I mean if the door was open we were there might there was no question if the door was open we were there so I saw a lot of ministers missionaries evangelists come through our little church and then one day my daddy heard about an evangelist William brandham BR so when he was in the area anywhere in the area we would try to go to his service my dad says I was in meetings like in 47 48 I don't I don't have a memory of those I was very young but I remember some of my earliest memories I think it was when I was like nine or 10 maybe eight and I remember the I I remember the angelist temple I remember remember that making such an impression on me and places like Clifton's Cafeteria I can see it you know in my mind's eye right now and then there was a place called brother brandom I heard it the other day referred to it and we called it the Cow Palace Palace it was actually um let's see I wrote it down cuz I wanted to look it up and be sure it was called the Great Western exhibit Center Great Western exhibit Center it was like a big where they auctioned off livestock like a Fairgrounds like thing so we went there one night and my dad got us and got our seats and then he had one of those little 8 mm movie cameras and he wanted to go out back and try to get a picture of brother brandom as they were bringing him in and I can remember you know just a little girl I was saying Daddy Daddy please let me go with you I want to go with you and I don't know what it was but that man made an impression on me as a little girl I knew he wasn't like those other ministers and missionaries and evangelists that we'd had you know that I'd seen and I know this sounds kind of silly or crazy but I not only did I want to go out there so I could see him I wanted I can remember this thought thought in my mind I wanted him to see me I wanted him to look at me I that's just what I remember thank you so anyway in in 57 my dad we moved from the Los Angeles area to Phoenix and he went to work for Brother John shered and if you don't you'll remember when I tell you he was the man that brother brandham talked about that had the citrus tree there in his yard that he grafted the various uh kinds of citrus into that one tree you remember that story he told about that so my dad went to work for for him and that I'll just tell you if you've ever wondered where that was there many times he he had brother Sher had a big house and then in the back he had a little a little room where he had a printing press he he printed Evangelistic like literature he he would print about brother bram's meetings and he just had a little uh religious um uh publication that he put out so he had this house a little printing press and a little house out back where Paul knows that my aunt wona and my Uncle Jimmy lived yeah I was over there many times and where that little tree was that was on actually it was on Third Street in Palm Lane it's downtown Phoenix now there's off office building there and but it was on right on the corner of Third Street in Palm Lane pal Lane and I'm trying to we went when we moved here we went to Brother Outlaw's church and I know brother Brandon mentions him in fact if yeah you want to put that I there's a picture of brother brandham coming out of brother Outlaw's church and oh no not that one no the one no none of those yeah that one that was brother brandham coming out in this church brother outlas was on 20th Street in Diamond it was one block north of Roosevelt [Music] Roos and that's me in that black skirt and white uh blouse and I like that picture because you know how it is when there's special meetings and the teenagers they want want to run out there and be with their friends and all I wanted to do is be close to him I just remember you know standing there looking at him in awe I was probably about 15 there I think I didn't know that picture existed for 20 or 30 years my aunt called me one day she said I'm going through some old pictures and I found want brother brand do you think and you're in there too do you want it I yes so I I don't even know who took it but I was very happy to have that so I'm GNA I'm going to jump over many of you may have seen my husband and you know I was raised in church and saw brother Bram as a young daughter young girl and Mike Mike didn't he was an atheist didn't believe in God thought people that went to church just they just needed a crutch something to lean on so he was he was from Texas he had after school he hitchhiked out to California and was just kind of buming around so he decided it was time to go back home to Texas and he ran out of money in Phoenix Phoenix so he had to just get a job so he could get back but he never got back kind of got a hook in him so he was on this job and he heard a a Christian man and a non-Christian man they were kind of debating all day and Mike thought that Christian man I think he's I think he might be genuine so that man kind of took Mike under his wing Mike didn't know one person in Phoenix he didn't know a soul so he he told Mike he said there's a there's a little preacher in town he's goes around to some little churches and you want to go with me tonight so mik said okay Mike and later he told me why did I say okay I don't even believe in that stuff I don't know why he said okay but he walked in to that little church and he said the minute brother brandham walked out this is his words he said my heart melted and he said something spoke to to his heart and said this man cannot lie to you so Mike said I didn't know what he was going to say but I knew it was going to be true and that very night I mean an atheist off the street at the end of the service brother brandham asked if anyone wanted to come down and give their heart to God and he went straight to the Altar and what's strange about that is brother brandham said it's usually women but there's there's four young men down here tonight and he said is there any ministers out there that would come up and pray and brother Jerry am along with was sitting out in that audience and he said the Lord spoke to him and told him to go pray with Mike and they be they became very good friends later but um those those meetings is where Mike and I met so he never got back to Texas uh I don't want to okay when I when I graduated high school my aunt gave me a little camera a little Kodak camera and so right after that I went with my parents to Hot Springs Arkansas Hot Springs Arkansas a lot of my parents family were was from there and so we we we were the meetings were out on a campground so I I talked to brother Billy paully Paul and I said if I give you my camera will you take some pictures of your daddy and he says yeah I will so he told me where to meet him after the service he pointed out a tree kind of far away from the building and you know after a service when they take brother Billy out to brother brandom out to the car people would just just start coming up and just flogging him and and you can imagine I mean if you had a baby that was just born and the doctor said it couldn't live you know you'd want to brother Brandon ple you know and people it was hard on him after he' had a long service but you you couldn't blame you know that's the way it was so brother bilot he said after he got his daddy in the car he just pointed a tree way back he says be standing back there I said okay yeah so when I saw brother brandham what was near the end of the surface I got up and went out and made my way back to that tree so in a few minutes here he he pulls up and I and I just want to say that um you know I was a Christian all my life I didn't really I wasn't did anything terribly bad but I was probably a little Retta you know what I'm sorry oh Retta you know when my dad wasn't look I tried to put a little bit of stuff on my eyelashes if he saw me he says get in there and was that face right now you know but I still so anyway brother brother Billy pulled up and and he rolled the window down and I'm handing him the camera and oh I'm sorry brother ROM was sitting in the passenger side I'll just show you what he did he he was sitting here he his head down like that to look you know to see me out the window he had he leaned his head down and this is what he did he went he went Sharon I see that clean face you know I I and how sweet you know how how sweet he did that you know Sharon I see that clean face Shar anyway I gave brother Billy the camera he left and then when he came back for the next service we met outside and he gave me the camera back and I'll just those pictures if you want to see these are the pictures that these were made in Hot Springs outside the motel July of 63 love those pictures there's several more there's just that's yeah that's all just wanted to share them with you special to me I'm trying to trying to remember one little thing brother brandom came this he was at the Rada but he also was at the westward hoe downtown down I think that was down around Adams and Central somewhere like that this is just kind of one of those little funny stories and so Rebecca was there at that meeting and here she comes we get there early and she's coming up to me like this she's got a real shiny thing right here so every young girl knows what that's all about so she comes up and we kind of hug and I said so you got engaged uh is it that boy you told me about yeah the boy you met at school the Baptist boy yeah yeah yeah I said what does your Rebecca what does your daddy think about that she oh he loves him I'm like I don't get it you know of course he teased me later and said so you're concerned about Rebecca marrying a Baptist and you married an atheist I said no he was an no so then um you know time went on Mike and I got married and this is really really special to me I was expecting our first child I thought I was about a month away I was actually about two weeks away and we went to my husband and I went to a meeting at the Ramada where brother Brown was and the service was very long they held the service a long time before they even turned it over to brother brandham and and I was so tired and my back I had a place in my back that was really bothering me so I got up to stretch my legs and go out to the ladies room and just kind of move around a little bit and as I was going out I saw sister brandom brandom she was uh Sarah was I think about 14 Little Brother Joseph was there he was about nine and there was the seat next to her was empty and she kind of looked up at me and smile and so I went out I went on out to the restroom stretch you know relaxed a little bit then I came back in and I sat down by her and uh brother Billy like he he would get a seat he would go early he'd find a seat and save he'd find a spot where sister brandom and the children could sit where can you hear me all right they could get out to the car quickly so that not to delay him from leaving it was uh uh brother it was he was preaching broken sisters so when brother brandham was winding down sister brandham got got the children and went out to the car and I went with her so she sat in the front seat and little Sarah was right behind [Music] her and little brother Joseph was in the middle then I was sitting there so sister Brandon and I were just visiting talking so I I I asked her I said later not now of course when you get home would you would you ask brother Brandon to remember me in prayer I've got a spot in on my back that's really bothering me and what I didn't know is that I was carrying the baby wrong the doctor was a little concerned I was very small he was concerned that I would have a little bit of problem I didn't know any that he didn't tell me that's probably what the pressure was from so I had asked sister Brown later you know when you get home later tomorrow what can you ask him to remember me she said yes so about that time I see a swirl of people and I I knew they were bringing brother brandom out so I got out of the car real quickly and walked around to the back and walked over and stood on the curb sidewalk and you then I just turned back to watch you couldn't turn your you couldn't walk away when he was around so I was just standing over on the sidewalk and I can I can see it right I mean I can see it today you know so he was looking out the window this way brother Billy was trying to get him in the car you know people running up brother BR and brother Billy was getting him in so he was he got in and sit down brother Billy was in his car his so he got in and sit down and then his head he went he just locked eyes with me I knew you know I mean just looking right at me and he through the wind you know through the wind he just went like that so I stepped off the curb and I walked around the front of the car and I came over to the side and he put his hand out the window right there know just said this soft simple prayer bowed his head and asked the Lord to be with me during delivery the baby and he just rolled up the window and drove away so I had her two weeks later and um well when I went into the delivery room the doctor when she [Music] came he he said I don't know what happened in there I thought you were going to have I thought I was expecting you to have a problem and and the baby just came out I I don't know I don't know what happened and the nurse the nurse told me the same thing she's I've been on Labor and Delivery for four years and I've I've never seen that happen well I know what happened you know so when uh when Jana was about that was when she was about two weeks old my brothers and my dad I think the three of them maybe just Dawson that time I don't know they were they were going to go hunting with with brother brandom so brother brandom uh came to our house and and and and it's very close right here where at that time my dad owned a little trailer court right on Southern and 33rd Street I mean it's like yeah right up here I showed I showed brother Lis last night a couple little pictures that were made this day that I'm talking about sorry with my brothers and and him but he came in the house and it was odd that this happened this way my mother was in the kitchen and my dad and brothers were outside so it was just the two of us there in the living room and so he said the first thing he said or maybe not the first thing I just remember him saying he said Rebecca told me you had the baby but I don't remember her name he said it's sound like it seems like it was something Frenchy that's the word he used and I named her Janna Michelle J Michelle Michelle was after her daddy Michael that's the way he expressed it he said I think it was something Frenchy and I said I said Jan Michelle J Michelle and and we were just talking it was a little while that we were just in there alone together I wish I knew then what I knew now I didn't understand I'm going to back up a little bit my husband the guy that knew nothing and I'm raised in church and in brother Brandon's meetings and right after after we married when we started going to brother Outlaws I know you've heard brother brandham talk about the Mosley boys L them very much so these Mosley boys started asking my husband and I to go out and eat after service on Sunday talking to Mike about the prophet and the seventh Church age message messenger oh I don't know about this and my husband's eating it up seriously I was praying for him I thought oh Lord don't let him get mixed up in something I mean I loved him and I knew there was something different but I didn't know I didn't I didn't have that Revelation I didn't know isn't that that's kind of oddd you know so he got a hold of some tapes seven Church ages I believe so he gets this big recorder and this big real drill and he listens to one he puts it off he listens to another one no tomorrow I remember this is kind of personal I remember I'm falling asleep on on the couch how sleep how can you sleep listen to this how can you sleep Mike you've been listening for eight hours I can't hear it anymore I can't I can't think of I can't think you know so he CAU it I was right behind him I caught it pretty quick after that but I always thought that was Str strange that you know here I'm the one raised in church and see brother brandham as a little child and he it was all new to him but back to in the in that in that room he said something for years and years I thought it can I back up again I keep thinking I'm I think I have that on my NOS but I you know when when brother brandham um did like this and had me come to the car I knew that she had not told him I I could see you know I I know she never turned to him and said hey you know have I knew that hadn't happened and I thought you know he he you know can you imagine and he he must have seen Visions all the time he had to have you know he comes out of a long service and and he's trying to leave and you know to think that the Lord was mindful enough of that little need that I had to show the prophet I'm sure everybody there had their need was much greater than mine but so I I wanted to ask sister brandom did you tell him to pray for I I knew she hadn't but I kept thinking I'm going to ask her that and I never did but about 20 years later maybe I a long time later uh brother brother Billy and sister Lois were in Phoenix phoen they had driven from Flagstaff and were going back to Tucson and so the phone rang at the house and it was brother Billy and he asked Mike and I meet him for lunch Paul I ran out to the barn and said mik get in here and get a shower quick we got to go so we went to meet them and I told Brother Billy that story that day and I said I always wanted to ask your mother if she told Brother brandom about that and I said I never got I never got the chance to ask her and he said well I can tell you right now I already know the answer to that she didn't tell him we knew we did not talk to Daddy when you know when he first came out of a meeting and got in the car we didn't talk to him he was so you know in another realm and they just give him space of time until he came out of that so he told me he said I I no she didn't so then I maybe that's the last time I'll jump around back to it in the living room with us talking he said something that was so strange to me I didn't understand it for years well maybe I still don't but it was right after I he he asked me the baby's name you know said Frenchy it was something Frenchy and he said you know I I never liked my middle name he said I thought I always thought it was too girly or feminine you know I I struggle with this I I feel like I know he said the word girly but I think he also said feminine and I I worried about that for years I was afraid I'd get the I don't want to say anything wrong I mean I know that I know you know I'll face the Lord with everything I'm saying right here want anything to be a mistake that's what I worry about so much I don't want anything I ask the Lord to not let me you know stop me if I was going to say something that was wrong but he said he said I filled out a form one time a legal form and I didn't want to write Maran down so I wrote Marvin Marvin and that stuck in my mind forever and I I thought it was strange and I thought I didn't want to tell anybody about it because I never heard it on tape and you know no one's obligated to believe anything unless they hear it on tape but I knew he I knew he said that I mean there was not a question it was is just stamped in my brain that and and in my mind I thought that he was referring [Music] to back in the day when a when a man turned 18 they had to sign up for the draft and that's in my mind that's what I thought it was but I never wanted to say that because I I wasn't sure I thought strongly it was something he said made me think that and I didn't tell anybody that about that for for years about telling me about writing Marvin in there and I was I was kind of afraid that people would find a way to criticize [Music] him in fact I told a cousin a niece of mine who's very good at like ancestry.com and stuff like that I said somewhere out there in cyber world is a farm that says say has Marvin on itom Marvin and I said if you ever if you ever find that I want to know cuz I know I know that's what he told me I told not hardly anybody about it and then about I tried to find that email today and I couldn't brother I asked brother Billy I told him about that I said brother Billy I haven't told Harley anybody about this because you know I never heard it on tape and I just kind of hated I said do you remember your dad using the name Marvin Marvin and he said well Sharon now that you brought it up I think I do remember daddy mentioning something about the word the name Marvin Marvin so brother Steve Robson and sister Danette they they left they were they were in Phoenix in two cars and they brother Steve had to go speak at a little church I think down in Mexico so they left one of their cars at my houseon Phoenix so the next day when they came back to get their car we were sitting down at the house for lunch and I told Brother Steve about this and he said Sharon Shar they they're using that they've already found that and they're using that they're you know those websites I don't touch them I Don't Go Near them I don't want anything to do with them they've already found that and they're they're using that you know like saying you know he lied about his name or something I don't you know name being Maran and I said are you kidding me and he said yeah it's all out there on the internet I said you're kidding wow so he sent me on my phone the the [Music] form and I think Sister Sarah [Music] was at my house that night and we started getting on the Internet good I just about I wanted to ball it the form is selective Selective Service and it has a number there you know and it has his name it says William Marvin Johnson it has his mother's name Ella it has their address there in Jeffersonville and I I was staring at that I thought he told me about this in 1965 you know those people would not believe that anyway you know I can't explain it I don't know why but I I knew all those years that that was just like burned in my heart that just right there in that living room he told me that and here this surfaces years lat I don't know exactly you know what they're trying to make out of that and I don't care it's too [Music] late nothing nothing satisfying but this to me so I think that's about all I I uh made it through this without fainting brother um Brother Louis just said something a while ago about Elijah was just like you know just a plain man and I was at I was at sister bram's house one day and I had a screaming headache um and my I didn't have anything I didn't have an aspirin or TI at all I thought I'm in the house of the Prophet I can't ask for an aspirin here what will they what will they think of me you know and my head was [Music] pounding so finally I said rebeccaa any chance you guys you might have a Tylenol or an aspirin she goes to the kitchen and throws up a cupboard she says aspirin Tylenol you name it we've got so there you know he was a prophet but he was kind of you know could be a normal one other little thing is just popped in my mind is my brother Dawson was he was a hunter that's just about all he did he was a guide and mainly bear and lion and brother brandham he took brother I think I think that one of the little the little lion in the den down there was my brother helped him get that I shouldn't word it that way I he didn't need any help anyway um both my dad and both my brothers were Havalina hunting I'm so scared I'll get I don't want to get this wrong but I I believe Joe told me they were at sunset sunset so they had all been out hunting that day they came back into the camp and my brother Joe who was not he hunted but not quite on the level of Dawson so Joe said I saw something really strange today he said I think I saw an albino Havalina Alo and Dawson's like what what are you talking it's well I don't know was really weird and my dad and Dawson I think they said well it's probably the sun shining on and you know glancing off it looked it looked white they're kind of having this little talk together back and forth brother bram's just sitting there listening a few minutes he said yeah one lives right back over there behind that mountain range and Joe said that's exactly where he had been so that conversation stopped can you imagine he you know I think he said one time it was hard hard to tell when he was in a vision and he he just must have seen him all the time well I forgot something else that that day that um it was after we talked about the name and then brother brandom came back a few few days later to get his car and go home and my mother asked him to come in to eat and he says oh no sister Ry I'm All Dirty I'm you know my mother couldn't she didn't care oh please come on in and eat with us so he agreed and my mother was very plain she wasn't fancy she was just very plain simple but she was a good cook but she she just had a a pot of chili beans and some cornbread that's what supper was that night so they sat down to eat and my mother said brother Brom if ID known you were going to be here I would have fixed like a roast or something nice and this he said but sister Riley this is you so then she brought out a pecan pie my dad had to have a pie like almost every night so she gave him the slice of pie and he he took a bite he said sister Riley Riley that is the best pean pie I have ever had and then he had another bite or two and he looked at her he said now I didn't have to say that he was letting her know he really meant it so my dad you know he ran with that I my wife makes the best that's the word of a prophet so brother Octavio Octavio did I wreck that word yes that's fine my son-in-law Paul said I could call your brother o so he asked me well bring a couple of Pies so I don't know what in the world is going to maybe they ate him back there already but you Brothers eat those back I brought two pies and I know this this is kind of may seem crazy but they're they're made in the same pie plates that my mother made for him so they're back there I don't know what we're going to do with two pies they're there and those are the same plates that my mother Ser so I do think that's all thank [Music] [Applause] you I guess I I told him I would sing one more song I and this is the I think I okay I better have the words um I think this is a I sang this here but I love the words to this I'm incapable of writing a song when I when I try to write one I get a trash can full of wed up paper but then sometime the Lord is gracious and and Ires so I'm gon to sing [Music] this never a man spoke like this man no not one in our day who have you ever heard speak to a storm then send it back from where it [Music] came this great man I'm telling you oh spoke with such power and yet so much love his words rang out with the [Music] Authority his words are a Lifeline to me never a man spoke like this man no not one in our day he never opened his mouth till God spoke to him then there was nothing that could stand in the way forces of evil demons of Hell had to obey before him they fell his words rang out with authority his words are a Lifeline to [Music] me never a man spoke like this man no not one in our day who else said hang a sign on my back if my words do not come to pass all of the things he did for tell every Vision every prophecy never can fail his words rang out with [Music] authority his words are Lifeline to me [Music] his words are a Lifeline to [Music] [Applause] me would you give another cap offering to the Lord amen may God bless her sister Sharon Sharon amen uh we've never met the prophet but we believe in one thing we believe in we believe in a resurrection then there's a Rapture in order to be in that Resurrection to be in the Rapture you must have perfect love am you must love every single one that can't be a 99% love 98% love and must be 100% genuine love of God in order to be in that Rapture to be part of that Resurrection she had the privilege to meet brother brandham and I want that privilege I believe I'm going to be part of that privilege I'm going to be part of that privilege on that resurrection and I'm going to shake brother bram's hand do you believe that do you believe you'll be there you got to believe that you'll be there not just brother brandom's hand all the saints that are waiting we have to be there the bride will be there perfect love will only be there talking about your brother won't get you there trying to destroy your brother won't get you there you must have perfect love and tonight may God give us that perfect love seal us with that perfect love and I want to shake brother brandom's hand I want to say brother brandham I've been waiting for this not just that but all the saints are you ready for that day we must get our lives ready we must trim our lamps you never know tonight might be our next night our sister said something very very special and she mentioned about brother brandom about his name all throughout the ages when God raised up his Prophet there's always been the contrary to try to go against God's Prophet it was Moses Then There Was Elijah they had their contrary then this day is no different there's Rosen many trying to go against the message of what brother rather but God sent the message to brother Bram and they've tried to make a little get the little mistakes brother BR said here and there here that document this that and the other God's Prophet makes no mistakes I'm going to say that again God's Prophet makes no mistakes in that letter it says William Marvin Branham William Marvin brandham and these group got that document and so you look there you see brother Bram he's a false prophet that is a government letter why would you lie to the government he put instead of putting Maran he put Marvin Marvin why did God allow brother Ram to do that if God allowed brother Bram to write it down that's more than enough and he told a sweet little sister that that leaves that lives in LaVine Arizona Arizona told her he said I put that I put that name down and those people see he's a false prophet and God is laughing at him saying I don't I don't make any mistakes I let him do it and so what God makes no mistakes I believe everything that brother Bram said we must believe everything that brother Bram said God's Prophet makes no mistakes how many you love the Lord won you please stand how many of you have a need tonight there this there's a roof sweet atmosphere do you feel that or it's just me it's really sweet atmosphere I feel like my chest is about to burst I feel a really sweet atmosphere you have a
