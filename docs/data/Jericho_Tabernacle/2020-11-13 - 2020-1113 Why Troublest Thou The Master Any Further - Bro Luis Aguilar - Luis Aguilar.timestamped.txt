[37:44] 35th verse
[37:48] capitalism while he yet spake
[37:52] there came from the ruler of the
[37:54] synagogue's house certain
[37:57] how certain which said thy daughter is
[38:00] dead
[38:00] why troublest thou the master any
[38:03] further
[38:05] um
[38:13] amen you may take your seats
[38:17] hey man once again it's real nice to see

[38:24] and i hope that all of you feel very
[38:26] good
[38:30] hey man are you you are happy to be here
[38:32] right
[38:35] because we're we're happy because we
[38:37] know he's here
[38:40] if he wasn't here well i'll we'll
[38:42] definitely be sad and so
[38:56] scripture tells us where there's two or
[38:57] three gathered in his name he said he'll
[38:59] be there
[39:03] that settles it that's it there's
[39:05] nothing else to it don't that's that's
[39:07] it he's
[39:08] two or three gathered in his name
[39:41] amen if i could place a title to our uh
[39:45] message this evening
[39:49] and i kind of want to in a certain way
[39:53] uh continue what we spoke about two
[39:56] weeks ago
[40:00] with the guidance of the lord
[40:04] and i'd like to grab my title there from
[40:07] the 35th verse
[40:33] and your husband doesn't doesn't treat
[40:35] you right to esposo
[40:42] why do you keep going with those
[40:43] religious fanatics
[40:47] i'm not sure you've been told that
[40:48] before
[41:18] i hope you understand what i'm saying
[41:21] you have said to yourself
[41:24] why do i keep going why do i keep
[41:28] listening to the tapes
[41:31] why do i keep reading the bible
[41:34] if this is still the same she doesn't
[41:37] change
[41:38] my marriage is still a wreck
[41:42] my daughter doesn't want to get right
[41:44] [Music]
[41:45] my son is doing this
[41:48] and sometimes those demons come to you
[41:53] and it says your daughter is dead
[41:58] you know she might not be physically
[42:00] dead
[42:02] but sometimes those demons tell you what
[42:04] she's spiritually dead she's not coming
[42:05] anymore
[42:09] for your husband anymore
[42:12] there's no more hope for your marriage
[42:28] but notice what jesus says on the 36th
[42:30] verse
[42:33] be not afraid only
[42:37] believe be not afraid
[42:41] only believe
[42:56] and the winds are tossing back and forth
[42:58] back and forth
[43:02] and you feel like you're a ship alone in
[43:03] the ocean
[43:07] i'm just rocking you back and forth
[43:24] you wake
[43:35] and you see your dad acting a certain
[43:37] way
[43:52] why do i keep doing it then
[43:56] this is all in vain do i just go to
[43:59] church in vain
[44:01] they told her they told this person
[44:05] your daughter is dead
[44:59] but notice that the one who gave the
[45:02] life
[45:28] we notice on the fifth chapter there on
[45:31] the first verse
[45:31] [Music]
[45:35] here mark begins to explain the
[45:37] scripture like we read two weeks ago
[45:43] about the maniac and cadera the el
[45:46] hombre el gadareno
[45:47] but here mark begins to kind of narrate
[45:50] a little bit more in detail
[45:56] and it says here it is on the sixth
[45:58] verse
[45:59] but when he saw jesus afar off cuando
[46:02] vio pues a jesus de lejos
[46:04] let me let me go for the fifth verse
[46:07] and always night and day he was in the
[46:09] mountains
[46:10] in the tombs crying and cutting himself
[46:13] with stones
[46:20] so notice this is the this is the the
[46:21] maniac and guidera and just
[46:25] that that was possessed with allegiance
[46:36] [Music]
[46:40] and cutting himself with stones
[46:43] you know a lot a lot of the times we i
[46:45] remember i was in
[46:46] school
[46:49] and i was sometimes this i always see
[46:52] young girls
[46:53] mainly young girls
[47:08] they want to you know the guest that
[47:10] satisfies them
[47:14] and i always always tell them why do you
[47:16] do that
[47:18] because it feels good and some will say
[47:21] because
[47:22] some will tell you flat out because they
[47:24] try to kill themselves
[47:28] i begin as as the masses begin to reveal
[47:31] itself
[47:34] i started to notice that it wasn't
[47:36] themselves
[47:41] and it says but when he saw jesus afar
[47:44] off
[47:47] he ran and worshiped him
[47:52] you notice here in the sixth verse he
[47:53] ran
[47:55] he worshipped and he cried with a loud
[47:58] voice said what do i have to do with the
[48:00] jesus
[48:04] jesus
[48:47] all the devils besought him saying send
[48:48] us into the swine that we may enter into
[48:51] them
[48:55] in four weeks jesus gave them leave and
[48:58] the unclean spirits went out
[48:59] and entered into the swine and the herd
[49:01] ran violently down a steep place into
[49:03] the sea
[49:04] they were about two thousand and they
[49:06] were choked
[49:07] in the sea jesus is
[49:31] and they that fed the swine fled and
[49:33] told it totally in the city and the
[49:34] country and they went out of this
[49:37] out of the sea what it was that was done
[49:47] so notice here that the swine asks jesus
[49:49] well lord if you
[49:50] allow us to enter in those wine and the
[49:53] lord gave them permission
[50:01] and here it says and it says he be in
[50:04] the legion sitting
[50:07] and clothed in the right mind he is
[50:17] and they saw and told him how it felt to
[50:19] him that he was possessed with the devil
[50:24] and also concerning the swine concern
[50:27] and they began to pray to him depart out
[50:29] of their coasts
[50:33] and when he was coming to the ship he
[50:35] that had been possessed with the devil
[50:37] prayed him that he might be with him
[50:46] so he'll notice here what jesus says
[50:49] how about jesus suffered him not but
[50:51] saith unto him
[51:35] the capitalists
[51:38] how great things jesus has done for him
[51:42] and all men did marvel
[51:45] says and i'm not sure what message he
[51:47] says it uh
[54:08] of you dyeing your hair
[54:12] you want to go diet i'm not sure what
[54:14] brother brian says about it
[54:17] he's our great-headed mother
[54:21] they're praying for their sons
[55:20] [Music]
[57:10] here's
[57:38] and then we say lord
[57:52] he gave
[58:05] go back to the scriptures
[58:18] no there's wood and fire up here no is
[59:00] [Music]
[59:17] enemies who's your enemy it's either
[59:20] possessed
[59:22] or to be possessed you're either going
[59:25] to conquer
[59:25] or you're going to be conquered
[59:29] that's a promise to you yes
[1:00:25] what gate stands before you
[1:01:36] is
[1:02:04] they literally
[1:02:31] there's no question about it and as
[1:02:35] after jesus finished with this guidera
[1:02:38] man
[1:02:40] here comes this man a ruler from the
[1:02:42] synagogue
[1:02:45] by the name of jairus
[1:03:22] but then here came a woman who had a
[1:03:24] blood issue for 12 years
[1:03:29] she was being tormented for 12 years
[1:03:33] and she suffered many things many
[1:03:35] physicians suffer
[1:03:37] spend all the money that she had gas
[1:03:41] and instead of getting better and better
[1:03:55] for 12 years said if i can only touch
[1:03:59] his garments
[1:04:02] if i can only touch him rather
[1:04:05] his garment almost being supervised and
[1:04:07] touch his body needs to get up to
[1:04:09] consequently he doesn't have to look at
[1:04:10] me he needs to get
[1:04:11] in again he doesn't know my name just by
[1:04:14] touching his garments
[1:04:17] no i will be healed
[1:04:20] but my question is
[1:05:22] and she said if i can only touch him
[1:05:26] and there when he touched him jesus says
[1:05:30] on the 30th verse
[1:05:33] and jesus immediately he
[1:06:03] disciples says jesus come down uh excuse
[1:06:07] me he says
[1:06:08] she says why you asked that
[1:06:12] why are you where do you ask who touched
[1:06:14] me
[1:06:16] there's a church full of people here
[1:06:20] who's touching you
[1:06:24] this one was different esta because
[1:06:27] virtue came out of me
[1:06:30] because they came
[1:06:35] and the scripture says immediately he
[1:06:37] knew in himself that someone touched
[1:06:39] them
[1:06:42] and then jesus turned and said to her
[1:06:59] you hoe no dicho
