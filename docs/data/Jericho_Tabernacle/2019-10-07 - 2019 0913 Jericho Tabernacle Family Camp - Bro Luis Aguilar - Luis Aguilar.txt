Madison now the theme or the subject is once in unbelief I'm gonna believe that there's not to sins no I don't speak about three sins my praise be there's only one sin now if I could place just a title if it be appropriate I like to grab brother Graham's message he preaches God's Word calls for a total separation of unbelief Paris I'm totally incredibly not that he calls for yama a total Runa complete separation tile of unbelief now in order for us to separate from something we first have to understand what we're separating ourselves from chaos is Thomas Esperanto if there's one sin we have to understand what that one sin is and if it is unbelief we must understand unbelief and what the van was venting are you with me am I seeing a man a man now what is shin what is unbelief but the branch says 1957 the book of Hebrews chapter seven part two if you take the word sin and you find out what it means the SCOOTER significant the word see it's in means unbelief apple avocado significant incredibly not now there's only two factions that is a believer creating or an unbeliever oh that's a justified person or a sinner mother Bram says that's all if you're an unbeliever you're you are a sinners that is piccolo no matter how good you are how much you go to church or even if you're a preacher you're still in a believer you have you understand what brother Ram just say even if you're a preacher you're still an unbelievable now on belief in what in my word and me in his word to put out and your neighbors word yeah you can just believe my word I was to put this plate in he's perfectly fine you can just believe your neighbors world can you be perfectly fine but have perfectamente p.m. you why because my word forgive me but it's not eternal no my word has no foundation people are nothing anymore now man you don't lose nothing who said up here if you disbelieve me you send me this creamy but the moment you need moment you just believe you said this god's
