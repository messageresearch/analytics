[1:14:41] we want to get into the word if we can
[1:14:42] go to the book of joshua
[1:14:45] josue to the first chapter
[1:14:49] verse one
[1:14:52] and we'll read verse one through three
[1:14:56] now after the death of moses the servant
[1:14:58] of the lord it came to pass that the
[1:15:00] lord speak unto joshua the son of nun
[1:15:03] moses is minister saying
[1:15:13] moses my servant is dead
[1:15:15] now therefore arise
[1:15:17] go over this jordan thou and all this
[1:15:20] people unto the land which i do give
[1:15:23] unto them even to the children of israel
[1:15:35] and every place
[1:15:37] that the soul of your foot shall tread
[1:15:40] upon that i will give unto you as i said
[1:15:43] unto moses
[1:16:00] lord first of all for this precious
[1:16:02] group of brethren we have before us
[1:16:32] and that tonight we may be able to tread
[1:16:34] upon that promised land
[1:16:39] that is our prayer this evening
[1:16:42] we ask it in the name of the lord jesus
[1:16:44] christ
[1:16:46] amen
[1:16:47] [Music]
[1:17:11] [Music]
[1:17:16] and today we want to learn from a young
[1:17:18] one one person who in their youth
[1:17:19] [Music]
[1:17:23] he was able to do things that others in
[1:17:26] their old age were never able to do el
[1:17:27] podo relisados
[1:17:37] now we know that joshua he
[1:17:39] came out of
[1:17:41] egypt along with moses
[1:18:08] and one of the things that really set
[1:18:10] him apart
[1:18:14] is that he had his eye on the promised
[1:18:16] land
[1:18:19] and he never moved his focus from that
[1:18:22] yeah
[1:18:25] [Applause]
[1:18:38] because
[1:18:46] by this time the lord has now
[1:18:48] uh stopped dealing with moses
[1:19:01] he says as he talks to him he says be
[1:19:04] strong and have a good courage
[1:19:20] he says
[1:19:42] but in english it says to push yourself
[1:19:43] to strive so that word is fuersa so the
[1:19:47] word strive if
[1:19:48] if we could go to english we'll have
[1:19:50] many meanings
[1:19:53] one would be try your best
[1:19:58] give an extra effort
[1:20:02] now if you see the word in spanish
[1:20:05] it's composed of two words
[1:20:08] which is strengthen yourself
[1:20:16] strengthen yourself especially in other
[1:20:18] words here the lord is telling joshua
[1:20:23] you're not a baby anymore
[1:20:25] i'm not gonna go and push you you're not
[1:20:28] i don't have to go and strengthen you
[1:20:29] you know
[1:20:58] if you want to or not
[1:21:01] whether you like it or not
[1:21:04] i command you to be strong
[1:21:08] of good courage
[1:21:11] see give the extra miles
[1:21:25] [Music]
[1:21:41] vamos a verona
[1:21:43] i don't know about how i don't know
[1:21:45] these people on the bible and these
[1:21:47] these other things you know
[1:21:52] about marvel
[1:21:54] marvel oh they know all the characters
[1:21:57] you know their powers uh
[1:22:00] they know their backstory
[1:22:04] they know and what movie they came out
[1:22:05] what this what that
[1:22:24] he tells him this
[1:22:26] he says this book
[1:22:29] of the law is
[1:22:31] shall it not depart out of thy mouth
[1:22:36] but that shall
[1:23:19] of the people from israel
[1:23:23] i'd like to read a quote from the brand
[1:23:26] in the message questions and answers
[1:23:30] it says
[1:23:32] they left egypt
[1:23:49] they came through the other side
[1:23:50] rejoicing and praising god
[1:23:55] and they went and got the laws and from
[1:23:57] there one to the promised land
[1:23:59] of uh
[1:24:25] and moses stretched forth his hand over
[1:24:27] the sea and the lord caused the sea to
[1:24:29] go back by a strong east wind
[1:24:32] all that night and made the sea dry land
[1:24:36] and the waters were divided
[1:24:42] oriental
[1:24:54] and with a blast of thy nostrils the
[1:24:57] waters were gathered together the flood
[1:24:59] stood upright as i keep and the depths
[1:25:02] were congealed in the heart of the scene
[1:25:24] when we see the movie
[1:25:38] all these people
[1:25:52] they're there
[1:26:00] [Applause]
[1:26:06] that he congealed the waters
[1:26:09] in other words another word for congeal
[1:26:13] he froze them
[1:26:16] oh what were those waters
[1:26:18] aguas that was the world
[1:26:34] the world to them was no longer a warm
[1:26:36] place
[1:26:39] but then the world was not a pleasant
[1:26:41] place
[1:26:44] it was a cold place
[1:26:47] see they left the things of the world
[1:26:51] let's say like this cold turkey
[1:26:55] at all
[1:26:58] completely
[1:27:00] so
[1:27:01] youth
[1:27:03] no we're not even we haven't even gotten
[1:27:04] to the message yet
[1:27:06] because it's crossing jordan
[1:27:10] but before you can even get to jordan
[1:27:13] you gotta have a baptism
[1:27:16] and i'm
[1:27:24] [Music]
[1:27:57] it's not
[1:28:15] it's gotta be either wet or dry
[1:28:20] no god don't want no cold or hot
[1:28:23] caliente
[1:28:24] he wants either choose a side el que
[1:28:46] so now this we see that when this
[1:28:49] happens
[1:28:51] if we go to the numbers 21-4
[1:29:06] to compass the land of edom and the soul
[1:29:08] of the people was much
[1:29:11] discouraged because of the way.
[1:29:18] and the people speak against god and
[1:29:20] against moses
[1:29:24] therefore have you brought us up out of
[1:29:25] the land out of egypt to die in the
[1:29:28] wilderness
[1:29:32] is there no bread
[1:29:34] neither water niagara
[1:29:36] look at look at what we just read
[1:29:40] by the way of the red sea por el camino
[1:29:43] del mar they just saw this tremendous
[1:29:45] miracle
[1:29:49] if we could say it like this
[1:30:02] [Music]
[1:30:04] hard
[1:30:06] have you brought us out here
[1:30:10] to die
[1:30:13] there's no bread noi there's no water no
[1:30:16] agua is this
[1:30:18] in that yes
[1:30:28] didn't you just see the power of god
[1:30:34] if you keep reading it says and the lord
[1:30:35] said fiery serpents amongst the people
[1:30:42] and we know the serpents beat the people
[1:31:17] and they still keep on doing what
[1:31:19] they're going to do
[1:31:24] oh yeah you're baptized
[1:31:27] oh you're free
[1:31:29] is libre but what about up here
[1:31:32] they still have the same old mind of a
[1:31:35] slave
[1:31:37] mentality
[1:31:38] oh yeah i don't drink no more
[1:31:41] oh i don't do drugs no more no consume
[1:31:45] oh that's good brother
[1:31:47] you think you're an overcomer because of
[1:31:48] that
[1:31:50] that's nothing
[1:31:52] no no overcome this no
[1:31:56] drinking whatever all those things
[1:32:00] that's easy
[1:32:02] but overcome this
[1:32:04] you come into the into the feet of the
[1:32:07] lord
[1:32:09] you're in church now
[1:32:24] maybe
[1:32:39] if you don't die to yourself
[1:32:42] those feelings are going to proceed
[1:32:45] but you know what happens now
[1:32:48] instead of going out to the bar to drink
[1:32:52] i'm going with the sisters
[1:32:54] hermanos and i'm going to go talk bad
[1:32:56] about this other sister
[1:32:59] oh you know what now i'm going to do
[1:33:01] this
[1:33:03] it's the same spirit
[1:33:05] but now it's worse
[1:33:10] [Music]
[1:33:18] we see that in exodus 32 and exodus
[1:33:21] we see that then the peep that moses
[1:33:23] goes up into the mountain
[1:33:26] he goes up to receive the commandments
[1:33:29] of the lord
[1:33:32] but he's delayed
[1:33:35] and he's there for 40 days
[1:33:38] and the peoples are saying well this
[1:33:39] moses is probably dead in one of the uh
[1:33:41] el pollo and comments
[1:33:44] have they not seen the miracles
[1:33:48] has got not fed
[1:34:03] oh yeah we still believe in god
[1:34:07] i i don't want to be under the
[1:34:09] responsibility of some pastor
[1:34:13] i'd rather be on my own
[1:34:16] and
[1:34:30] i go with the calf
[1:34:34] i do what i want
[1:34:36] now this golden calf is my god
[1:34:43] now why what i always ask myself
[1:34:46] why a cat
[1:34:49] there's a reason behind it
[1:34:51] did you know that uh
[1:34:54] uh there's periods of time in the in the
[1:34:56] skies
[1:35:12] but during that time durant
[1:35:13] the sign in the stars
[1:35:16] was taurus
[1:35:22] so what did they say it was
[1:35:24] look at the sky oh
[1:36:49] oh it does matter who is guiding you
[1:36:53] see moses was the guy
[1:36:57] see god said they're your people
[1:37:01] you're responsible for them
[1:37:08] and then moses speaks
[1:37:11] and he tells him
[1:37:14] he says and moses and moses besought the
[1:37:17] lord his god and said lord why doest
[1:37:20] thou wrath what
[1:37:22] wrath hot what against thy people which
[1:37:25] thou hath brought forth out of the land
[1:37:27] of egypt with great power and with a
[1:37:29] mighty hand
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:38:14] to
[1:38:30] we need to reach that maturity tenemos
[1:38:33] to where we cannot judge
[1:38:38] but extend grace
[1:38:41] stand on the bridge
[1:39:27] this young man
[1:39:29] he stayed with the ministry
[1:39:34] ministries
[1:39:36] where god was working
[1:40:06] we know that time goes on
[1:40:09] that then they go to the river jordan
[1:40:15] and moses then has the twelve spies
[1:40:20] and then they come back
[1:40:22] we know then only joshua and caleb gave
[1:40:24] the good reports
[1:40:28] they said we can do it
[1:40:31] and everyone else said no we can't
[1:40:34] joshua and caleb
[1:41:18] die to yourself
[1:41:20] and the one with the father he said
[1:41:23] we have a living example
[1:41:26] we have a joshua
[1:41:29] that brought us the evidence
[1:41:37] [Applause]
[1:41:46] and everyone else
[1:41:49] died
[1:41:52] oh the beauty what what a wonderful
[1:41:54] brethren
[1:41:56] they were they were baptized
[1:42:02] they died with the same mentality they
[1:42:04] had when they were slaves
[1:42:09] isn't there something wrong with that
[1:42:12] now in
[1:42:27] if you see a 40 year old man
[1:42:30] that's it mommy i still want a diaper
[1:42:32] and a bottle
[1:42:34] um
[1:42:37] you see a
[1:42:38] 50 year old man
[1:42:40] this is
[1:42:42] [Music]
[1:43:08] they die like big babies
[1:43:11] they were never able to cross over
[1:43:12] jordan
[1:43:14] they were never able to surpass the mind
[1:43:16] or the mentality of a slave
[1:43:20] mentality
[1:43:21] but this young man
[1:43:24] he was a slave el fuest but he was able
[1:43:27] to have a transformation of his mind
[1:43:32] there's a key right there
[1:43:35] he was able to keep his focus on the
[1:43:40] [Music]
[1:43:44] and we know as we read in the in the
[1:43:46] beginning
[1:43:49] the lord then started to deal with
[1:43:50] joshua
[1:44:03] when it's time to cross over yeah
[1:44:07] what was the first thing that they
[1:44:09] crossed over
[1:44:12] was it joshua
[1:44:14] no no they said it says
[1:44:17] the priest bearing the ark of the
[1:44:19] covenant before the people
[1:44:25] wow
[1:44:26] it says and the priests that bear the
[1:44:27] ark were dipped in the brim of the water
[1:45:24] if we go to the
[1:45:26] quote in the message israel and the
[1:45:29] church
[1:45:32] he says and he looked down through with
[1:45:34] angry eyes
[1:45:38] and he said when he did the red sea got
[1:45:41] scared and began
[1:46:12] one of these days you're going to try to
[1:46:14] follow that holy ghost band
[1:46:20] and you'll find out your wheels you said
[1:46:23] i yeah
[1:46:24] well come
[1:46:40] from the same mentality of the
[1:46:41] wilderness
[1:46:44] from the same mentality of the red sea
[1:46:46] mentality
[1:46:47] you've got to cross on dry land
[1:46:52] you have to
[1:47:22] see the people were slaves
[1:47:26] there were slaves to the world
[1:47:29] they were slaves to the devil
[1:47:32] diablo
[1:47:33] but you know what
[1:47:44] now he by this fall he has took over and
[1:47:48] possessed the garden of eden himself
[1:47:54] and he took it over
[1:47:58] and now he has six thousand years of
[1:48:00] deceitful rule
[1:48:14] because they were based on free moral
[1:48:16] agencies
[1:48:20] to act any way they wish
[1:48:25] so people today
[1:48:28] they think he used and they have rights
[1:48:32] they think that they're doing what they
[1:48:34] want to do
[1:48:37] but it's a deceitful rule
[1:48:41] when you do your will
[1:49:14] as long as you keep doing what you think
[1:49:16] is right
[1:49:19] all you're going to do is make a bunch
[1:49:21] of mud
[1:49:24] because all you're going to do is going
[1:49:25] to try to mix your mentality
[1:49:49] [Music]
[1:50:06] and we want to cross jordan now yeah it
[1:50:08] is
[1:50:24] now as
[1:50:25] though the people cross over
[1:50:29] something happened
[1:50:31] while they're in the wilderness
[1:50:36] el senor los mis he would give them food
[1:50:40] he would give them meat
[1:50:43] he would give them water
[1:50:45] agua their shoes would grow along with
[1:50:47] their feet
[1:50:51] their uh would grow with them
[1:50:55] it wouldn't tear no
[1:50:57] oh
[1:50:58] they had a pillar of fire
[1:51:02] that would
[1:51:03] cap over them in the night
[1:51:45] i'm not gonna grab you like a baby
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:28] we need that god in us
[1:52:32] oh we need a living god
[1:52:36] but not the god of only of heaven
[1:52:39] not just the god of moses
[1:52:42] but you need a living
[1:53:25] but were they filled with it
[1:53:29] there's a difference exist
[1:53:31] we can go to church
[1:53:34] we can feel the presence of the lord
[1:53:37] and say glory be to god
[1:53:40] but what happens on monday
[1:53:43] what happens the rest of the week
[1:53:46] is the
[1:53:47] is the cloud not in here
[1:53:51] is the presence of god not in here
[1:54:05] he did the best he could
[1:54:15] it says there that while joshua lived
[1:54:35] they were under the rule of joshua
[1:54:40] they were true to the lord
[1:54:45] if we
[1:54:46] go away
[1:55:15] in the book of second kings
[1:55:29] they come to the same river
[1:55:34] jordan
[1:55:36] and you know what elijah does
[1:55:39] takes off his mantle
[1:55:42] now what's a mantle
[1:55:45] it's a piece of clothing it's rupa it's
[1:55:49] they call it
[1:55:50] a dress square
[1:55:54] he took his dress where el tomoso
[1:55:57] says he folded it
[1:56:08] and when he crossed to the other side
[1:56:11] he found himself in a rapture
[1:56:16] now youth we're waiting for that rapture
[1:56:20] who wants to be in that rapture
[1:56:24] well here elijah gave us the key
[1:56:27] elias
[1:56:28] if we could read in the message putting
[1:56:30] on the whole armor of god
[1:56:34] says now god's fortifying his army
[1:56:39] with what conquest
[1:56:54] what was god doing
[1:56:57] listen

[1:57:02] that office of the church is

[1:57:45] he took the the clothing
[1:57:50] that was covering god
[1:57:53] and he smoked the waters
[1:57:56] and he walked on dry land
[1:57:59] oh yes with my brothers and sisters
[1:58:03] there is a ministry
[1:58:05] ministerial that has that mantle
[1:58:09] there is a ministry
[1:58:11] ministerial that speaks of clean gospel
[1:58:16] there is a message that brother bernie
[1:58:18] preached
[1:58:27] [Music]
[1:58:32] of what god is telling us
[1:58:37] through that mask
[1:58:40] through that dress
[1:58:42] but you know what we do but
[1:58:45] we look at god
[1:59:00] what
[1:59:43] we need to hear the word of god
[1:59:48] and we see here that when
[1:59:50] when elijah smote the waters
[1:59:55] he went up into the rapture
[1:59:58] and alicia yeliseo he asked for a double
[2:00:01] portion
[2:00:03] and he received the same mantle
[2:00:06] and he came to the waters
[2:00:09] and he said
[2:00:10] where's
[2:00:24] is
[2:00:56] but now we're in the book of matthew
[2:00:59] matteo matthew 3 mateo
[2:01:01] and it says there if you say then cometh
[2:01:04] jesus untogether lead to jordan
[2:01:21] he began his ministry el comenzo
[2:01:23] ministerio by coming to jordan
[2:01:28] he himself el mismo he died to all his
[2:01:32] rights
[2:01:35] and he then took on what god asked of
[2:01:38] him
[2:01:42] we know then there as the scripture
[2:01:44] continues
[2:01:48] when he is baptized
[2:01:50] the spirit of god descending like a dove
[2:01:55] and lighting upon him
[2:01:59] a voice from heaven
[2:02:01] um
[2:02:40] jesus was baptized in jordan jesus
[2:02:58] because there the lord separated from
[2:03:01] him
[2:03:05] so that then he could die as a man
[2:03:08] oh the everlasting eternal god
[2:03:12] the god
[2:04:33] i am sending them into the world
[2:04:50] i am praying not yo no

[2:06:11] as much as you loved me a secret
[2:06:27] we have the same experience
[2:06:32] i want to read a quote brother branagh
[2:06:36] in the in the in the church each book
[2:06:41] in the pergaming church
[2:06:47] notice the harmony of the father and the
[2:06:50] son
[2:06:52] harmony
[2:06:54] jesus never did anything jesus
[2:06:58] until it was first shown
[2:07:01] him by the father
[2:07:06] john 5 19 and juan cinco di
[2:07:09] estar
[2:07:10] is now to exist aura kicks between the
[2:07:14] groom entre el novio and his bride is he
[2:07:18] shows her el moistra
[2:07:21] in his words
[2:07:23] of life
[2:07:24] she
[2:07:39] raise it up again
[2:07:42] here is the secret of this
[2:07:45] look at what brother branham is telling
[2:07:47] us
[2:07:49] the secret of this is
[2:07:52] the word
[2:08:05] what was the problem with the people of
[2:08:07] israel
[2:08:09] they had the same mind
[2:08:13] from before the antis
[2:08:15] but here brother branham
[2:08:18] is telling us
[2:08:20] the bride
[2:08:34] is
[2:08:47] for she knows what he wants done with
[2:08:50] the word
[2:08:54] she performs the command of the word in
[2:08:57] his name
[2:09:00] for she has thus saith the lord
[2:09:25] [Music]

[2:09:39] planted and watered
[2:09:43] up it comes to full harvest
[2:10:12] we must
[2:10:54] they only speak what is thus saith the
[2:10:57] lord
[2:11:00] that is so hard to do is because we have
[2:11:02] so many things to say
[2:11:06] but he says if the lord does not say
[2:11:08] anything
[2:11:23] [Music]
[2:11:45] for it was not yet time for him to do
[2:11:48] certain things
[2:12:04] which he left for this specific time
[2:12:09] in particular there is where you and i
[2:12:11] come in
[2:12:13] we are not just any people
[2:12:17] we are a special people
[2:12:30] because that's when you're most alive
[2:12:46] it's when
[2:13:28] what am
[2:13:41] god will work with his creature this is
[2:13:46] the way he's made him
[2:13:48] you don't have to figure it out
[2:13:53] works with his creature
[2:13:56] in the way
[2:14:32] it's good to pray for healing
[2:14:34] if you need deliverance
[2:14:37] it's good to pray for that
[2:14:39] but you know what you can get sick the
[2:14:41] next day
[2:14:44] you know what a week later you can be in
[2:14:46] bondage again
[2:14:50] you can have then all these blessings
[2:14:56] the people of israel had them in the
[2:14:58] wilderness
[2:15:05] but they missed that key ingredient
[2:15:09] to have the mind of christ
[2:15:13] to be one with him he said
[2:15:16] to be filled with his holy ghost
[2:15:19] not anointed
[2:15:48] until i
