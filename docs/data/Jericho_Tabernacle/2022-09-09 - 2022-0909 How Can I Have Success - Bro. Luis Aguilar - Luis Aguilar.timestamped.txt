[32:35] amen
[32:36] if you can if you have it you can please

[32:45] i don't think we should be embarrassed

[32:52] right
[32:52] i don't know we shouldn't
[32:54] have
[32:56] joshua 1
[32:58] verse 6
[32:59] and josue
[33:01] be strong and of good courage for unto
[33:04] this people shalt thou divide for an
[33:07] inheritance the land which i swear on to
[33:10] their fathers to give them
[33:23] only be thou strong and very courageous
[33:26] that thou mayest observe to do according
[33:28] to all the law
[33:29] which moses my servant commanded thee
[33:32] turn not turn out from it to the right
[33:35] hand or to the left that thou mayest
[33:37] prosper
[33:38] whatsoever thou goest
[33:50] yes
[33:58] this book of the law shall not depart
[34:00] out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate
[34:02] therein day and night that thou mayest
[34:04] observe to do according to all that is
[34:06] written therein
[34:08] for then thou shalt make thy way
[34:10] prosperous and then thou shalt have good
[34:13] success
[34:33] bless the remnant of his word you may be
[34:34] seated
[34:38] i'd like to thank the musicians for
[34:40] their hard work
[34:43] [Music]
[34:45] amen
[34:46] are you happy tonight
[34:50] this evening we would like to speak on a
[34:52] very simple subject
[34:57] would like to entitle it how can i have
[35:00] success
[35:03] i think that's a very interesting
[35:05] subject
[35:06] for young people today
[35:12] because i believe that every single one
[35:13] of us would like to have success
[35:18] and perhaps maybe even the adults would
[35:21] like to have success
[35:25] and whatever you do or whatever you're
[35:27] doing
[35:40] but the key thing is that they don't
[35:41] they want to be successful they don't
[35:43] want to be unsuccessful
[35:49] i believe that your goal is to be
[35:51] successful
[35:54] and i believe that our job as a ministry
[36:08] how many of you like to be stranded on
[36:09] the side of the road
[36:46] [Music]
[37:06] want our our christian members to be
[37:09] successful
[37:12] success in their natural life
[37:14] getting an exit
[37:16] video
[37:17] and their job in their school
[37:19] [Music]
[37:20] but also be successful in their
[37:22] spiritual life
[37:25] spiritual brother branham says
[37:28] it says these thirsts are just natural
[37:32] esta solamente is natural
[37:35] they are natural for the christian
[37:38] cristiano they're natural for the human
[37:40] being
[37:43] if you could put that slide for me there
[37:44] sister the message thirsts
[38:01] there is also a thirst for success
[38:06] so we have a thirst
[38:10] to be successful
[38:13] amen amen
[38:15] so many people today
[38:29] and we go down there and people will
[38:31] spend thousands of dollars to send their
[38:33] children to the school
[38:40] and universities colleges and so forth
[38:42] to get an education
[38:54] but now i have no i have nothing against
[38:57] that
[39:09] and still haven't found the right
[39:11] success
[39:35] because they that will just temporarily
[39:38] make things a little easier for you here
[39:40] porque
[40:08] go get a job
[40:10] be successful in life sexy
[40:13] because things are hard in life now
[40:17] but keep in mind
[40:19] remember this
[40:22] this is just
[40:28] to make things a little easier for you
[40:30] whether you're here on earth
[40:36] says
[40:45] we thought about being successful here
[40:47] on earth
[41:04] and
[41:17] that's awesome right there that's enough
[41:18] to go home
[41:21] that's enough right there that quote
[41:23] right there
[41:25] if you read that quote about a hundred
[41:27] times
[41:29] you can get so many revelations out of
[41:31] that one quote
[41:44] i tell the young people memorize the
[41:46] tape until memorized even when brother
[41:47] braddon coughs
[41:54] as you as you remember where even when
[41:56] brother ram is what he's going to say
[41:57] next hasta punto de capua
[41:59] this is
[42:11] because that's only temporary right now
[42:12] as we live
[42:16] but those
[42:17] you might have three thousand dollars in
[42:18] the checking account
[42:21] some of us in here might have a hundred
[42:23] dollars in our checking account
[42:26] doesn't matter how much you have in your
[42:27] checking account
[42:31] [Music]
[42:47] and all the economy we have we leave it
[42:49] here
[42:52] amen amen brother braham says
[42:55] in the next slide brother brahm says
[43:00] but men wanted to be
[43:02] like they compare or they copy after
[43:05] pero sombras
[43:10] see a lot of a lot of people today
[43:13] there's a spirit of copying
[43:17] they want to be copycats
[43:21] you should be genuine
[43:24] be yourself
[43:26] there's a lot of impersonators of elvis
[43:28] presley
[43:31] i've never been to vegas but
[43:34] i heard there's a lot of impersonators
[44:27] amen
[44:29] go
[44:30] they go like they go like the world does
[44:34] el mundo and say the things that they do
[44:39] i hope the young people are listening
[44:42] make a success the way
[44:44] they were a success
[44:49] we can never be a success doing anything
[44:52] the world does
[44:58] we can only be a success as we follow
[45:01] after god's statues
[45:06] and his way of doing things
[45:10] so how can we have success
[45:13] not patterning ourselves after the world
[45:16] patronage
[45:32] we can never be
[45:35] by patterning after the world
[45:38] if the cigarette company has met their
[45:40] greatest success by television
[45:46] and the beer and the whiskey crowds has
[45:49] made their great success he has a
[45:50] contribution of television
[45:58] that's no sign
[46:00] that the church shall make it success by
[46:03] television
[46:08] the success of the church
[46:11] el cito de la iglesia lies within
[46:22] we cannot say because the television
[46:24] done such and such for the cigarette
[46:26] company
[46:44] [Music]
[46:50] but that's not what god ordained us to
[46:52] do perez
[47:05] causing great colorful things to take
[47:07] place that that is a success
[47:14] we are
[47:15] we are dying daily on our feet estamos
[47:18] muriendo
[47:20] spiritually speaking espiritu
[47:33] we do well to stand ten strong with the
[47:35] holy spirit with us
[48:04] they have
[48:08] and you should try to have a successful
[48:10] life here on earth
[48:13] that shouldn't be your main goal
[48:19] your goal should to go look for the
[48:21] spiritual things in life
[48:30] says
[48:45] when they come out of egypt
[48:48] they were led by the king of heaven
[48:51] god was their king
[48:54] that was the secret of their powers
[49:00] that was
[49:04] [Music]
[49:14] what was
[49:19] [Music]
[49:40] [Music]
[49:52] what happened to israel once they
[49:54] settled down
[49:55] israel
[50:01] [Music]
[50:10] that's
[50:20] [Music]
[50:50] but they wanted a big eloquent man pero
[50:52] que
[50:55] [Music]
[51:45] you want to be successful in life
[52:01] that's close to church
[52:19] don't look for something far out look
[52:20] for god first
[52:23] look for god first
[52:28] moses
[52:29] oh he learned
[52:41] [Music]
[52:43] human weaknesses real quick
[52:48] he learned them real good
[52:51] he learned it so well
[52:54] then when god called them
[52:56] he had seven weaknesses
[53:07] did you ever study in the first part of
[53:09] exodus
[53:46] [Music]
[53:54] he had one he had seven
[54:00] the sixth one was exception
[54:05] imagine having a weakness in your
[54:06] weaknesses not being successful
[54:40] [Music]
[55:08] [Music]
[55:40] [Music]
[55:46] about the word
[55:50] amen
[55:52] i think that's a challenge for the young
[55:53] people and every single one of us here
[55:55] today
[55:59] we know who the president is
[56:14] we
[56:28] i'm not sure if you don't like this
[56:29] message or what no
[56:33] but you should know god
[56:36] you know you know how you could get to
[56:38] know him
[56:42] is
[56:52] there was a successful young man in the
[56:54] bible
[57:21] whatever you decide tonight whatever you
[57:23] decide tonight right now
[57:27] [Music]
[57:52] you don't think
[57:59] this young man and you can find it in
[58:01] saint matthew the 19th chapter
[58:20] man
[58:22] was asked to forsake all.
[58:26] but he refused to do it
[58:29] and sometimes
[58:31] if we apply prosperity and riches and so
[58:34] forth
[58:45] and still didn't have eternal life
[58:52] success doesn't always mean that that's
[58:54] a blessing from god
[58:59] there's two types of success
[59:02] success of the
[59:04] and then there's a right success with
[59:06] god
[59:08] this young man had a question yes
[59:11] just like every single one of you
[59:12] happens
[59:15] what's after this life
[59:25] but this young man was raised up in
[59:27] church
[59:29] he went to sunday school
[59:39] and all the all the commandments that
[59:41] moses put down he told us
[59:44] he
[59:58] you know when you're
[1:00:12] [Music]
[1:00:25] but you know that there's something
[1:00:26] missing
[1:00:34] and you start hearing something they
[1:00:35] shouldn't be hearing
[1:00:36] maybe a little tick yo
[1:00:39] i don't know what it is
[1:00:53] he found out that there's something
[1:00:54] missing within him
[1:00:58] imagine he's living a clean just like
[1:01:02] he lived the commandments that joseph
[1:01:04] that moses
[1:01:06] but he could not lie to himself
[1:01:08] you're
[1:01:10] [Music]
[1:01:21] but what i like about this young man
[1:01:41] [Music]
[1:01:49] is the word made flesh martinez
[1:01:51] [Music]
[1:02:03] not just in the spirit but in the flesh
[1:02:06] but this young man
[1:02:08] he did not go to just anything
[1:02:10] because he preaches
[1:02:14] he went direct straight directly to
[1:02:16] jesus
[1:02:17] he went straight to the world
[1:03:01] that there was something special about
[1:03:02] that man
[1:03:04] he went and he said good master
[1:03:07] why do you call me good
[1:03:10] only good one is god
[1:03:13] even jesus christ
[1:03:15] [Music]
[1:03:42] he said
[1:03:56] and he said i have a question
[1:04:00] how can i have eternal life
[1:04:04] if you want eternal life he said
[1:04:07] if you want life
[1:04:09] follow the commandments
[1:04:38] if you want to be perfect
[1:04:40] sell everything
[1:04:43] and come follow me
[1:04:47] so then we see that the young man
[1:04:50] it hurt him
[1:05:06] he said
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:20] the prophet tells me
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:46] i'm gonna focus on what
[1:06:02] when his gift is is mature his talent
[1:06:05] has a challenge
[1:06:09] and whatever customer comes and says
[1:06:13] no matter what kind of hair he has
[1:06:28] he's not thinking oh this is very thin
[1:06:30] hair no here
[1:06:34] because his talent is already matured
[1:06:36] amen
[1:06:41] so once somebody has
[1:06:43] mastered their talent
[1:06:46] it doesn't matter if he's in phoenix
[1:06:48] if he's in china
[1:06:50] or if he's in china
[1:06:54] and he can trust in his talent
[1:06:56] amen amen
[1:07:41] you can open up a barber shop where
[1:07:43] there is no one
[1:07:46] we'll bring people in
[1:07:49] so then this young man
[1:07:53] he was a very successful
[1:08:20] he didn't want to subject himself to
[1:08:21] another
[1:08:38] the money didn't hurt
[1:08:40] it didn't hurt me the business
[1:08:43] what hurt him
[1:08:44] subject himself
[1:08:47] that's where it hurt him the most
[1:09:09] [Music]
[1:09:22] [Music]
[1:09:26] do you think his businesses went to
[1:09:27] bankruptcy
[1:09:31] what happened
[1:09:46] the
[1:10:02] not because he was afraid that he wasn't
[1:10:03] going to be successful anymore
[1:10:07] it was because he did not know
[1:10:09] he didn't want to humble himself
[1:10:12] to follow another man
[1:10:14] amen
[1:10:26] and they rose early in the morning
[1:10:41] [Music]
[1:10:55] believe his prophets
[1:10:58] so shall ye prosper
[1:11:04] so if we believe that we have prophets
[1:11:07] let's follow what the prophet said
[1:11:09] prosper to be able
[1:11:20] the scripture says that if we have a
[1:11:21] prophet then let's hear the prophet
[1:11:23] for what to be able to do
[1:11:26] to be successful
[1:11:28] what the prophet said
[1:11:30] that's what we should do
[1:11:35] they have given us the key to be able to
[1:11:36] be successful
[1:12:07] what my servant moses has commanded you
[1:12:10] el propheta
[1:12:11] the prophet of god
[1:12:13] almost here in san lucas capitolo this
[1:12:16] is uh this is
[1:12:17] we're going to go to saint luke chapter
[1:12:19] 16.
[1:12:20] ivanov
[1:12:22] now we're going to find out what
[1:12:23] happened to this young man
[1:12:28] we're going to see what his end result
[1:12:30] ended up being okay
[1:12:35] because remember everything that we do
[1:12:36] here on earth
[1:12:39] there will be a consequence
[1:12:42] there will always be a consequence
[1:12:45] in san lucas
[1:12:47] this is ace in saint luke 16.
[1:12:51] verse 19.
[1:13:02] there was a certain rich man which was
[1:13:04] clothed in purple and fine linen and
[1:13:06] fared sumptuously every day
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:16] el cuales
[1:13:20] in verse 20 and there was a certain
[1:13:21] beggar named lazarus which was laid at
[1:13:23] his gate full of sores
[1:13:28] so we see there that there's the rich
[1:13:30] man
[1:13:58] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[1:14:00] and was carried by the angels on into
[1:14:02] abraham's bosom the rich man also died
[1:14:05] and was buried
[1:14:12] so then we see here that it doesn't
[1:14:13] matter how much money you have in your
[1:14:14] bank account
[1:14:18] death will come at your door
[1:14:23] and in verse 23 and in hell he lifted up
[1:14:25] his eyes
[1:14:28] so then there is a hell
[1:14:32] so then there is a hell
[1:14:35] estando
[1:14:36] en los tormentos being in torments
[1:15:01] and we see that the rich young man went
[1:15:03] to hell
[1:15:08] abraham
[1:15:09] and he cried and said father abraham
[1:15:16] maybe we can stay right there for about
[1:15:18] two years
[1:15:20] this young man
[1:15:51] abraham
[1:15:53] still said father abraham
[1:15:56] wow
[1:16:01] how many of you believe
[1:16:07] do you believe that every single child
[1:16:08] of abraham
[1:16:10] go with god
[1:16:15] right here the scripture's telling me
[1:16:17] that he was a child of vaporum
[1:16:32] he said father abraham abraham
[1:16:38] where did you say it in heaven
[1:16:42] he said it in hell
[1:16:44] amen what a bible study huh
[1:16:46] wow
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:17:00] i'm your
[1:17:52] they said father abraham then recorded
[1:17:55] me have mercy on me yeah
[1:18:02] and send lazarus that he may dip the tip
[1:18:04] of his finger in water and cool my
[1:18:06] tongue
[1:18:09] for i am tormented in this flame
[1:18:14] but abraham said
[1:18:21] son
[1:18:49] very quickly we're going to switch over
[1:18:51] to romans
[1:18:54] i hope that you have your bibles tonight
[1:18:56] romanos
[1:18:58] romans chapter 9.
[1:19:01] verse 7
[1:19:06] and here paul is stating to the romans
[1:19:10] ni
[1:19:12] abraham neither because they are the
[1:19:14] seed of abraham
[1:19:16] are they all children
[1:19:21] but in isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:19:25] that is that this
[1:19:27] no
[1:19:29] they which are the children of the flesh
[1:19:33] these are not the children of god
[1:19:37] will be moving
[1:19:39] do we live in the flesh
[1:19:45] let's be born again
[1:20:02] but the children of the promise are
[1:20:04] counted for the seed
[1:20:10] they which are the children of the flesh
[1:20:13] these are not the children of god
[1:20:20] it's very tremendous what verse 7 says
[1:20:22] here neither because they are the seed
[1:20:24] of abraham are they called are they all
[1:20:26] children
[1:20:30] so we're going to turn to saint luke
[1:20:36] we're going to turn back to the story
[1:20:37] that which we left
[1:20:42] so he was abraham's seed
[1:20:57] will determine our destination
[1:21:01] in verse 26
[1:21:09] and beside all this between us and you
[1:21:11] there is a great gulf fixed
[1:21:16] so then we see heaven and we see hell
[1:21:20] and they could see each other
[1:21:23] but they could not enter
[1:21:25] interchangeably
[1:21:40] just meditate on that
[1:21:45] we which are on this side cannot cross
[1:21:47] over to that side
[1:21:50] and those that are on that side cannot
[1:21:51] cross over to this side
[1:22:14] then he said i pray thee therefore
[1:22:16] father
[1:22:19] that thou would have sent him to my
[1:22:21] father's house
[1:22:36] they also come into this place of
[1:22:38] torment
[1:22:40] what did the rich man
[1:22:42] he said
[1:22:45] if you can't come over here
[1:22:47] to be able to refresh my tongue
[1:22:50] so then
[1:24:01] please send somebody to the house of my
[1:24:02] father
[1:24:05] abraham they say and abraham said
[1:24:09] they have moses
[1:24:11] and the prophets
[1:24:14] let them hear them who said it
[1:24:18] he said hear them
[1:24:21] hear them
[1:24:25] that's the key
[1:24:27] there's the scripture yeah
[1:24:41] who are the prophets of today
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:56] process
[1:24:58] listen to the prophets
[1:25:08] they must point to him who is the same
[1:25:11] yesterday today and forever
[1:25:13] so then in verse 30 he says
[1:25:17] no
[1:25:17] and he said nay father abraham
[1:25:21] but if one
[1:25:22] father
[1:25:38] if they see someone that was buried and
[1:25:40] resurrected
[1:25:42] and it goes to their house
[1:25:45] and say repent because
[1:25:48] he's not in heaven he's in hell
[1:26:05] and people still don't believe
[1:26:20] god raised
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:47] if i see a demon then i'll get baptized
[1:27:16] was

[1:29:11] you know what he did
[1:29:15] he went out and had all big times
[1:29:17] fiestas
[1:29:20] and throw big parties and spend lots of
[1:29:22] money
[1:29:30] and then he got married and possibly had
[1:29:32] a family maybe had a family
[1:29:35] and he just increased so much yes
[1:29:41] so he had to build new barns and things

[1:30:55] hand
[1:30:58] i own great songs of land
[1:31:13] a very fine person to be peros
[1:31:17] but you know the bible said yes
[1:31:20] that night
[1:31:21] god said unto him
[1:31:25] i am going to require your soul
[1:31:28] then what did
[1:31:45] it doesn't matter who you are
[1:31:51] that does not mean that god is with you
[1:31:55] because you have a house and you have a
[1:31:56] knife
[1:31:59] it does not mean that god is with you
[1:32:02] but i do believe
[1:32:04] i believe that you hear what i'm saying
[1:32:09] i believe that the believers of this
[1:32:10] message
[1:32:22] the prophet has given us the key to be
[1:32:23] able to
[1:33:06] you
[1:33:51] [Music]
