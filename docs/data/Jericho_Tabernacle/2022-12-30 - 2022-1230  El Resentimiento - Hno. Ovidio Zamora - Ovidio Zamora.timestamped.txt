[38:59] Jesus Christ amen amen
[39:13] know what I
[39:18] ordered
[39:19] [Music]
[39:25] chronometry
[39:27] I set a timer that way I don't go past
[39:29] my time
[39:31] and if I do go over my time I apologize
[39:35] okay Mateo
[39:40] in the Book of Matthew chapter 15. you
[39:43] can say verse 18.
[39:46] [Music]
[39:50] God's word says
[39:53] [Music]
[40:01] but those things which proceed out of
[40:04] the mouth come forth from the heart and
[40:07] they defile the man
[40:09] OS
[40:12] is
[40:20] testimonials
[40:22] for out of the heart proceed evil
[40:24] thoughts murders adulteries fornications
[40:27] thefts false witness and blasphemous
[40:31] [Music]
[40:38] these are the things which to follow a
[40:41] man but to eat with unwashing hands
[40:44] default nothingman
[40:46] [Music]
[40:48] you may be Cedar Brothers
[41:01] and
[41:05] yeah
[41:10] so happens that the last time that Cesar
[41:13] spoke Hernandez Brothers on this last
[41:17] time he spoke
[41:23] when he started speaking he said he was
[41:26] very nervous
[41:30] and I told him
[41:33] never say that you're nervous
[41:38] because then you get the people nervous
[41:44] and now it turns out I'm I'm in a worse
[41:47] scenario than he is
[41:52] just for example I can't find my notes
[41:59] and those is
[42:01] [Music]
[42:03] well let's begin
[42:06] I couldn't find them
[42:11] we're going to do something different
[42:13] tonight
[42:19] just imagine we're at a high school a
[42:22] class at the at the University or a high
[42:25] school
[42:26] you're my students
[42:30] I'm going to choose now a very special
[42:32] student
[42:35] he's very bright and he's a good student
[42:38] and I'm gonna ask him a series of
[42:41] questions
[42:44] so I'm the teacher I'm the the professor
[42:47] here
[42:49] I'm gonna ask
[42:53] if I squeeze this orange
[42:56] what comes out of it
[43:01] orange juice
[43:04] can someone get them a mic
[43:07] okay
[43:11] and I would say
[43:16] can it be possibly grapefruit juice that
[43:20] can come out of it
[43:21] no
[43:26] they always
[43:28] what about apple juice
[43:31] no no
[43:33] he's right
[43:36] Anton says
[43:40] porque
[43:42] tiene
[43:44] why is it that orange juice has to come
[43:47] out of this
[43:49] amen
[43:51] it's what's on the inside already Bueno
[43:58] you answered every question correctly
[44:02] I'm gonna change it a bit now
[44:06] Nosotros now we
[44:10] this orange is now not the orange but
[44:13] it's mean
[44:15] this orange represents every one of us
[44:20] if I pressure if I put pressure if I
[44:23] squeeze it
[44:25] then what do you think will come out of
[44:27] it
[44:27] style intro
[44:30] what's on the inside
[44:34] so then
[44:39] when a person is pressured
[44:42] or they're squeezed
[44:45] then what comes out is
[44:48] the resentment all of you hatred Rancor
[44:52] grudges Envy
[45:00] in the Bible and so much more
[45:04] and tone says so therefore
[45:08] the IE from there
[45:14] sentimento we're going to speak a bit
[45:16] about resentment
[45:19] I wasn't going to mention this but
[45:22] yeah
[45:26] on Christmas and the day after we got
[45:29] two phone calls
[45:33] from two married women
[45:37] they're friends of the family
[45:41] yes one of them
[45:45] esposa spoke to my wife
[45:50] and she talked about what was happening
[45:52] in her marriage
[45:59] so what impacted me the most
[46:10] foreign
[46:24] it came to mind that scripture about
[46:26] Moses giving the writing of divorcement
[46:28] it was due to the hardness of the heart
[46:35] and I just thought that scripture was
[46:37] written there just because
[46:39] but when I heard that
[46:42] when she said
[46:49] I just have resentment and hatred and
[46:53] such a rage against him I hate him
[47:03] and I would ask myself why is it
[47:07] that a woman that initially fell in love
[47:09] has gone to that point that now she
[47:11] hates him
[47:16] so when the when my wife gave me the
[47:19] phone
[47:21] I didn't spend that much time talking to
[47:23] her
[47:25] and I just gave her a simple solution
[47:29] the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:36] as brother Louise spoke at the funeral
[47:39] foreign
[47:51] there's only one way you can get to see
[47:54] her again
[47:55] there's only one solution
[47:58] it's the Lord Jesus Christ
[48:02] we can't do anything without the Lord
[48:04] Jesus Christ
[48:06] two days afterwards
[48:11] I had a niece that called us
[48:14] is
[48:23] because in this holiday season and
[48:26] Christmas that's what the devil attacks
[48:28] the most with hatred
[48:31] I think that conversation lasted about
[48:34] two hours
[48:38] and she told us
[48:41] I've reached the breaking point
[48:44] there's no solution to this
[48:47] we're getting a divorce
[48:53] so seeing that they both made that
[48:56] decision
[48:58] the only thing that we advise them the
[49:01] parents is to separate themselves
[49:04] foreign
[49:24] there's no other solution
[49:26] when
[49:29] one of my daughters went through that
[49:37] that divorce happened because of her
[49:41] into this
[49:43] Mexico Papa then she said dad you have a
[49:46] look on me she talked to me
[49:50] I acknowledge that I was guilty and for
[49:54] him divorcing me
[49:59] but now I recognize that and I want to I
[50:03] want to resume my relationship with my
[50:05] husband
[50:11] three here so when I said
[50:15] I promise
[50:21] and I said I promise I'll talk to him to
[50:24] do everything that I can that way you
[50:25] can both get back together
[50:28] and I talked to him
[50:32] and he told me
[50:39] he would always call me Mr obedo
[50:42] there's nothing that can be done
[50:46] I've made my choice
[50:49] I'm not getting back with her
[50:52] they have two daughters
[50:54] this
[50:57] was something that happened around eight
[51:00] nine years ago
[51:02] and Thursdays
[51:05] so then I said
[51:08] here's where the rolls flipped
[51:11] the hardness of the heart
[51:15] was now in the woman
[51:23] the hardness is not always in the heart
[51:25] of man
[51:27] you say and I know
[51:30] they're here with us
[51:38] don't even think I'll mention names but
[51:40] here with us that that's something that
[51:43] has happened here
[51:47] that has happened here people have come
[51:50] with me to talk
[51:52] about the situation
[51:55] I've seen women
[51:59] the area
[52:02] foreign
[52:19] they treat the woman like trash like a
[52:22] doormat
[52:25] [Music]
[52:27] maybe somebody is already understanding
[52:30] what I'm talking about
[52:34] and I've realized
[52:39] that years go by
[52:42] and years go by
[52:45] e
[52:46] and the resentment is still there is
[52:52] the resentment is still embedded in them
[53:03] so I sincerely
[53:07] when I see those kinds of cases
[53:11] it's something that breaks my heart
[53:14] because I've seen women cry
[53:20] in front of me with their own tears
[53:22] coming out of their eyes
[53:28] telling me about their life and
[53:30] testimony and the treatment that they
[53:31] got from that man
[53:35] this here
[53:38] that's why there was a servant of God
[53:41] that would always say
[53:46] I recommend all the young sisters that
[53:49] are wanting to get married to look
[53:51] first for the new birth
[53:57] because when we get married we're in
[53:59] love
[54:04] my first marriage I got married when I
[54:06] was in love and then I got divorced
[54:09] she's already passed away
[54:13] the husband of my wife passed away as
[54:16] well
[54:17] and then we met up
[54:20] and we started our life together
[54:24] [Music]
[54:32] what I'm telling you is not only the
[54:35] message or in the Bible but it's
[54:37] something that's from my own life
[54:41] so when I married my current wife
[54:44] I said I will never
[54:48] get divorced again
[54:53] Phoenix and it so happens that we came
[54:55] to Phoenix
[54:56] in the message already
[54:59] and two of my children
[55:02] came with us
[55:10] then there was another one that came
[55:12] that now lives in Oklahoma
[55:15] so these young men
[55:20] made life impossible for my current wife
[55:26] those amendments
[55:29] [Music]
[55:32] so then there was a resentment that set
[55:34] in and that's why I keep mentioning the
[55:36] word resentment
[55:40] there was a resentment that came in
[55:42] there was a spirit that came in
[55:46] and I have my daughter here foreign
[56:05] did not love my children
[56:10] and she only loved her own children
[56:14] so we reached that stage I'm saying
[56:19] and I I said to her you know what no I'm
[56:22] sorry it was here we're going to get a
[56:24] divorce
[56:26] that's why when I see marriages
[56:30] that they both have children on both
[56:33] sides
[56:36] I pray for that marriage because I know
[56:39] what kind of issues both sides will have
[56:43] experience
[56:47] what I'm telling you are my own life
[56:49] experiences
[56:50] so I said to her
[57:00] [Music]
[57:05] an older one and a young one and they've
[57:07] grown up they even have kids and
[57:09] grandchildren now
[57:13] the issue is
[57:17] that I went with my pastor
[57:21] and I told him I'm going to get a
[57:23] divorce and he asked why are you getting
[57:26] divorced
[57:27] because of this this and this
[57:33] he says no you're not getting divorced
[57:36] because that's a demon
[57:40] and I'm going to pray for that demon to
[57:42] get out of you and he prayed for me and
[57:46] that demon did come out
[57:52] placed in my mind to get divorced
[57:55] Ure
[57:59] and by this time I was already in the
[58:02] message I was in usher in the church I
[58:05] felt really holy
[58:06] cow yeah I would even I I had some time
[58:10] preaching
[58:12] and then all of a sudden I wanted to get
[58:14] divorced
[58:18] but the devil's so tremendous
[58:21] that when you least expect it you're in
[58:24] his clutches
[58:26] why because he used your mind
[58:34] that she didn't love my children only
[58:36] she loved her own children
[58:40] even I would reject it back then
[58:46] it was about 25 30 years ago
[58:51] now she says she calls me dad I call her
[58:54] daughter
[58:55] I'm her dad
[58:59] because she was raised with me and her
[59:01] father already passed away
[59:06] we have a very beautiful relationship
[59:09] with the children and with my own
[59:12] children
[59:13] to this
[59:16] you listen your list you are Nemo so I
[59:20] encourage
[59:21] the marriages here
[59:26] that the husband has a son
[59:29] and the wife has her own child
[59:35] to not separate from the word
[59:42] and he's a dividing thing that comes
[59:45] among you come with your pastor
[59:48] foreign
[59:55] don't try to fix it on your own because
[59:57] you won't be able to fix it on your own
[1:00:00] I've seen marriages
[1:00:03] face to face
[1:00:10] one part is forgiving the other party
[1:00:13] does not want to accept the forgiveness
[1:00:16] it's better if they broke up
[1:00:23] they've broken up
[1:00:27] emotions
[1:00:29] I know there's a lot of sisters here
[1:00:31] that have gone through that
[1:00:33] they've Fallen
[1:00:37] and then they ask why do I have so much
[1:00:40] resentment
[1:00:44] maybe in the past it went through a case
[1:00:46] of adultery in their marriage
[1:00:48] and they forgave each other
[1:00:56] but you just simply forgave from your
[1:00:58] mouth
[1:00:59] and the other person forgives but not
[1:01:02] really from their heart
[1:01:03] is
[1:01:07] and they begin to live a life that seems
[1:01:11] normal
[1:01:12] but when a problem arises
[1:01:17] the woman or the husband
[1:01:23] she calls back that adultery
[1:01:26] that is already under the blood because
[1:01:29] it was already confessed
[1:01:32] your sin and
[1:01:36] it's like that drop of ink that drops
[1:01:39] into that tub of Clorox
[1:01:43] it vanishes as soon as you confess your
[1:01:46] sin
[1:01:49] you're so clean
[1:01:53] as white wall
[1:01:57] you confess your sin down
[1:02:00] at that moment you're forgiven now
[1:02:07] there was one
[1:02:10] [Music]
[1:02:13] I was going to leave it off to the end I
[1:02:16] was going to close with it but I'll
[1:02:17] mention it now oh no it was one
[1:02:20] this this orange
[1:02:23] his name was Jesus
[1:02:27] this Jesus
[1:02:30] foreign
[1:02:37] then what came out of him
[1:02:40] perdon forgiveness Mercy
[1:02:46] is
[1:02:47] and if that isn't what comes out of us
[1:02:51] then we need the Holy Spirit
[1:02:55] because that's the only solution is
[1:03:02] if you have if you have some sort of
[1:03:05] resentment if you've been having it for
[1:03:07] 20 30 years now
[1:03:09] you know what will happen to you
[1:03:12] you'll have cancer because
[1:03:15] you have tuberculosis leukemia
[1:03:19] because you carry
[1:03:21] that resentment
[1:03:29] will cause you a disease because it will
[1:03:31] physically affect you
[1:03:36] I won't read the scripture because it's
[1:03:39] too long I'll just remark it
[1:03:43] when David
[1:03:49] when David committed adultery with
[1:03:52] Bathsheba
[1:03:53] and you know the story already
[1:03:56] but the point is this
[1:04:00] there was a boy a child that was born
[1:04:03] from that adultery
[1:04:06] the Bible says that that God was not
[1:04:09] pleased with that with David
[1:04:11] because that woman was already married
[1:04:15] and the man was one of David's best
[1:04:19] soldiers and he sent him
[1:04:22] to the Forefront of the battle so that
[1:04:25] he could intentionally die
[1:04:28] and don't says so then
[1:04:33] David
[1:04:35] um
[1:04:36] he sent your rise to the the Forefront
[1:04:39] of the battle and he got killed
[1:04:42] once he died
[1:04:45] he tried to fix that issue
[1:04:53] he uh one with that woman he married her
[1:04:55] she now belonged to him
[1:04:58] and then time went on
[1:05:00] time went on
[1:05:03] and you know what happened
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:08] I'll read this one
[1:05:11] and Psalms 32.
[1:05:18] was not confessing a sin
[1:05:22] us
[1:05:25] the whole time he was sick and sick and
[1:05:28] sick and falling and falling and falling
[1:05:30] until finally
[1:05:36] in Psalms 32 it says
[1:05:47] when I kept silence my bones wax old
[1:05:50] through my roaring all the day long
[1:05:57] for day and night thy hand was Heavy
[1:05:59] upon me he said
[1:06:03] my moisture is turned into the jaw of
[1:06:06] Summer
[1:06:08] but now here is the the solution
[1:06:11] whatever the problem is
[1:06:16] this is I acknowledge my sin uncity
[1:06:21] and my iniquity have I not hid I said
[1:06:27] I will confess my transgressions unto
[1:06:30] the Lord
[1:06:33] and thou forgive us the iniquity of my
[1:06:36] sin
[1:06:40] he forgave that adultery that he
[1:06:43] committed
[1:06:44] but yet he had to pay a price
[1:06:49] because
[1:06:52] the prophet Nathan told him the son you
[1:06:54] had he will have to die and that's how
[1:06:57] it happened
[1:06:59] the son he had died
[1:07:02] Aura now the well hello
[1:07:06] I'm going to read what the meaning of
[1:07:10] resentment
[1:07:12] from the dictionary
[1:07:14] is
[1:07:16] a moral pain
[1:07:21] that is produced as the outcome of an
[1:07:24] offense
[1:07:26] the person that suffers
[1:07:29] isn't able to forget that offense
[1:07:35] so therefore he begins to feel it one
[1:07:38] time after another
[1:07:40] he resents
[1:07:43] that's why it's resentment
[1:07:50] it's a sentiment that you feel again so
[1:07:54] it's you you it's a resentment you
[1:07:56] repeat the the feeling
[1:07:58] so 10 15 years ago bye
[1:08:02] and you still uh resent it
[1:08:05] and maybe you're still living with your
[1:08:07] husband
[1:08:10] but that life isn't life it's a it's a
[1:08:13] living hell
[1:08:14] and my daughter
[1:08:19] my wife or my daughter now that is
[1:08:21] divorced
[1:08:24] she said her life was a living hell
[1:08:27] yeah
[1:08:31] once we broke off the relationship
[1:08:35] I came back to life again
[1:08:39] I was myself again
[1:08:42] so
[1:08:49] this is this feeling goes along with
[1:08:52] grudges and hostility
[1:08:56] towards them caused the harm
[1:09:00] that's why the person can't heal
[1:09:04] that's why they can't heal
[1:09:07] because they're just turning one side to
[1:09:10] another on the same issue
[1:09:14] towards them that caused the harm
[1:09:17] now what is grudges
[1:09:24] it's a tenacious rooted resentment
[1:09:33] and resentment is connected to another
[1:09:36] kind of hatred like grudges
[1:09:41] that's why grudges are even worse than
[1:09:43] resentment
[1:09:46] but it's it's something that causes or
[1:09:50] is caused from the same thing
[1:09:56] graduates in Psychology we understand
[1:09:58] it's a very uh powerful feeling
[1:10:01] and deep persistente and nagging
[1:10:06] that is kept throughout time
[1:10:11] that is embedded in our inner being
[1:10:17] causing us to emotionally affect us on a
[1:10:20] negative scale
[1:10:21] and physically as well
[1:10:26] now remember David
[1:10:29] as long as he did not confess his sins
[1:10:37] so everything was going wrong he was
[1:10:40] getting sick his bones waxed old
[1:10:42] he was in drop but when he confesses
[1:10:47] physically
[1:10:50] Divine Healing came to him
[1:10:53] forgive me
[1:11:02] but this is how the Lord led me
[1:11:09] a very uh excruciating Grudge or intense
[1:11:13] Grudge
[1:11:17] can drive us to hatred
[1:11:21] now it's on hatred now
[1:11:32] [Music]
[1:11:38] now it's not only resentment it's hatred
[1:11:46] and the last term to describe it there's
[1:11:49] a need for vengeance
[1:11:51] if you did it to me I'll do it back to
[1:11:54] him
[1:11:56] if uh
[1:11:58] that way he can know who he's dealing
[1:12:01] with
[1:12:05] there's different negative feelings that
[1:12:07] arise because of it
[1:12:09] and
[1:12:11] they say
[1:12:13] constantly
[1:12:17] sentient
[1:12:20] it's understood in a classic way
[1:12:24] and it's understood in the classic way I
[1:12:27] foreign
[1:12:37] and it doesn't allow us to keep moving
[1:12:39] forward
[1:12:58] then the passion of resentment
[1:13:02] it consumes you
[1:13:04] physically
[1:13:11] stress
[1:13:13] why is there so much stress why is there
[1:13:17] so much sickness
[1:13:20] the more sin there is the more sickness
[1:13:22] there is
[1:13:24] but there is a solution Brothers
[1:13:31] of forgiveness
[1:13:35] that's the solution
[1:13:38] pero
[1:13:40] I am problema but there is a problem
[1:13:47] the foundation of Christianity is faith
[1:13:52] but faith
[1:13:55] it has its own base
[1:14:03] when you put the foundation you're not
[1:14:05] you're not going to put it on Sand you
[1:14:06] have to put it on a base
[1:14:08] so the foundation of faith
[1:14:12] is forgiveness
[1:14:14] is
[1:14:19] if you look at the Statue of a perfect
[1:14:21] man at the bottom of the pyramid
[1:14:23] you have three little lines
[1:14:28] justification sanctification
[1:14:30] sanctification
[1:14:33] and the new birth
[1:14:35] or the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:38] so then you can say
[1:14:47] for example how can I go to the altars
[1:14:50] so God can deliver me from this
[1:14:51] resentment if I have not been born
[1:14:54] [Music]
[1:14:56] if the person has not been born again
[1:14:58] they cannot overcome that resentment
[1:15:01] they can't
[1:15:02] why
[1:15:05] because they must forgive
[1:15:07] to go up
[1:15:09] towards Faith
[1:15:12] so when you're born again
[1:15:15] the love of Jesus Christ will come to
[1:15:17] your heart
[1:15:20] and the love of Jesus Christ
[1:15:24] resentment and can't hold grudges it can
[1:15:27] hate
[1:15:28] is
[1:15:30] the solution
[1:15:32] yes is environment the new birth
[1:15:36] Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[1:15:38] in the person in the heart
[1:15:45] you can't even pray for someone else
[1:15:48] as long as you don't have the new birth
[1:15:50] if the Holy Ghost has not come to you
[1:15:54] you can't even pray for anyone else
[1:15:57] [Applause]
[1:15:58] yes everyone
[1:16:00] foreign
[1:16:27] and you can add more things to it
[1:16:29] Revenge
[1:16:37] and
[1:16:39] you can find all the consequences of
[1:16:42] that
[1:16:45] speaking about resentment the prophet
[1:16:48] says
[1:16:52] preach in 1953.
[1:16:59] this is the beginning of the fame of
[1:17:02] Jesus
[1:17:03] paragraph 32.
[1:17:08] he says there was a little baby with
[1:17:10] epilepsy
[1:17:13] he had a little shroud that was tied
[1:17:16] around pinned together
[1:17:22] and he was having a seizure right there
[1:17:25] on the on the platform the little kid
[1:17:27] the little child was
[1:17:41] and nevertheless there was a somewhat of
[1:17:44] a resentment
[1:17:46] he was able to catch a resentment
[1:17:52] [Music]
[1:17:56] like a minister at the public
[1:17:59] you can catch someone has resentment or
[1:18:01] someone has a certain feeling you can
[1:18:04] even catch it from up here
[1:18:06] he said you can feel it you can sense it
[1:18:09] in the back
[1:18:11] there was around 28
[1:18:14] 000 people that night
[1:18:20] move far away in the back there was a
[1:18:23] resentment that kept coming
[1:18:25] he says I looked up and it was a
[1:18:28] Ministry
[1:18:30] and it was around eight to ten of his
[1:18:32] people here and I told the Usher go they
[1:18:37] yes
[1:18:39] go and have that minister to Bow his
[1:18:42] head
[1:18:44] a moment afterwards and he said
[1:18:48] that Minister said yes
[1:18:52] this is a public worship place
[1:18:56] I don't have to bow my head Lord
[1:19:06] and I said uh mister
[1:19:10] so you're not going to Bow your head
[1:19:14] he said was still up
[1:19:18] with his face he was still up
[1:19:22] and I said we've been very well
[1:19:26] Americano that's your American privilege
[1:19:29] but remember I'm not to be held
[1:19:33] accountable
[1:19:34] and that little one that was having a
[1:19:37] strong seizure
[1:19:38] Celestial I said Heavenly Father
[1:19:42] foreign
[1:20:05] Lord we're very grateful with you that
[1:20:07] baby went off the platform with his
[1:20:09] mother
[1:20:11] and I heard a commotion
[1:20:14] and all the groups
[1:20:18] that was with this Minister worship
[1:20:20] we're suffering now with
[1:20:51] being irreverent to the prophet and to
[1:20:54] the word of God
[1:20:57] Aurora now
[1:21:01] Christo the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:21:05] taught us
[1:21:11] despite people insulting you hitting you
[1:21:14] spitting on you um humiliating you
[1:21:18] is
[1:21:23] receiving a spit from the drunk soldiers
[1:21:26] are pulling the hairs of his
[1:21:30] beards
[1:21:32] if someone has a beard just pull your
[1:21:35] beard you're going to see how how much
[1:21:36] it hurts
[1:21:37] I don't think anyone here has a beard
[1:21:40] right
[1:21:41] in those days
[1:21:43] so then solo respondio he just answered
[1:21:46] from perdon with forgiveness and
[1:21:53] even had mercy there on the powerful
[1:21:55] Center and that sinner was saying
[1:21:59] because he was reverent with the Lord
[1:22:03] now the question we should ask ourselves
[1:22:06] our own selves
[1:22:09] what is it that is coming out of me when
[1:22:12] I'm squeezed or when I'm pressured
[1:22:17] what is that comes out of me
[1:22:20] yeah yeah they must and moreover
[1:22:25] I'll be closing now
[1:22:28] Faith In Love
[1:22:30] are related they're relatives
[1:22:34] you can't have one without the other
[1:22:38] interface
[1:22:40] because you cannot have faith without
[1:22:42] having love
[1:22:44] if you have not been born again
[1:22:47] you cannot have love
[1:22:49] you cannot have faith
[1:22:54] you can't be set free from that demon of
[1:22:57] resentment
[1:22:59] because you can have faith with the
[1:23:02] happiness okay
[1:23:05] because your very faith is based on a
[1:23:08] god who's the mere essence of love
[1:23:11] so then faith and love work together
[1:23:18] that's why faith is based on love
[1:23:23] perfect
[1:23:27] on page number four of the message
[1:23:32] brother Brandon doesn't really talk much
[1:23:34] about that he just says
[1:23:38] if you cannot forgive
[1:23:41] you cannot have love
[1:23:46] you can't have faith
[1:23:49] and consequently
[1:23:55] you can't be sent free from that
[1:23:57] resentment that for so many years you
[1:23:59] carried with you
[1:24:01] and I'll close with this
[1:24:11] [Music]
[1:24:13] I had another commentary that was called
[1:24:15] the way down
[1:24:16] but I can't I'll just finish with these
[1:24:19] other two stories
[1:24:23] I took it from the book The Journey
[1:24:26] of Billy Graham
[1:24:29] if you don't have that book I I
[1:24:32] recommend that you get it it's called
[1:24:34] The Journey the journey
[1:24:45] a while ago a woman wrote me a lengthy
[1:24:49] letter
[1:24:56] wherein she spoke about how much she had
[1:24:59] so much bitterness against her
[1:25:00] ex-husband
[1:25:02] I understood her pain
[1:25:05] but then afterwards she mentioned okay
[1:25:11] that her divorce happened more than 20
[1:25:13] years ago
[1:25:17] sadly this woman was a captive to the
[1:25:20] Past
[1:25:23] poisoned by the bitterness all these
[1:25:25] years
[1:25:30] for some people wrath and bitterness
[1:25:33] become part of their identity
[1:25:38] it's that that makes it even harder for
[1:25:41] them to get rid of their problems
[1:25:43] we can't change the past
[1:25:47] we can only seek God's forgiveness
[1:25:51] for the wrong things that we did
[1:25:54] but once the Lord has forgiven us
[1:25:59] shouldn't we also forgive
[1:26:03] which is the hardest thing to do
[1:26:07] don't let the past keep you captive yes
[1:26:13] take your bitterness and resentment and
[1:26:16] put them at the feet of the Cross Jesus
[1:26:18] said
[1:26:20] if the son indeed has set you free
[1:26:24] shall be free indeed
[1:26:27] John 8 36.
[1:26:31] That's The Power of forgiveness
[1:26:35] closing now
[1:26:42] there was another man that Billy Graham
[1:26:44] says that he wrote to him he said the
[1:26:47] man said
[1:26:49] it's the hardest thing that I've done
[1:26:56] but I feel like they took off a load of
[1:26:59] 500 kilos off of my back
[1:27:04] he spoke about the transforming power of
[1:27:07] forgiveness
[1:27:12] almost all weeks our people are writing
[1:27:15] to me telling me I cannot forgive
[1:27:18] me it's because you don't you simply
[1:27:22] don't know how much that person has hurt
[1:27:23] me
[1:27:26] this is something that might echo in
[1:27:28] your very thoughts
[1:27:32] but nevertheless there is nothing that
[1:27:34] will completely set us free from the
[1:27:36] past
[1:27:39] or open the door to reconciliation as
[1:27:42] forgiveness
[1:27:47] even though the other person would deny
[1:27:50] to accept any fault or will laugh at our
[1:27:53] forgiveness
[1:27:55] that should not hold us back
[1:27:58] Colossians 3 3.
[1:28:02] that's how we should forgive the others
[1:28:05] Hermanos so Brothers
[1:28:20] when you go to a river
[1:28:23] and you take water in your hands
[1:28:27] you can't drink the same water again
[1:28:34] and that same water that you want to
[1:28:36] grab is now floating Beyond
[1:28:40] so the pass is now
[1:28:43] passed we can't bring it back
[1:28:46] we can't fix the past
[1:28:51] where we messed up where we uh failed

[1:29:31] if they don't love me then they won't
[1:29:33] make it then
[1:29:34] they won't make it
[1:29:39] it's better to love and to forgive

[1:30:13] the case like the prophet saws
[1:30:17] that's how we are sometimes like eagles
[1:30:19] and cages

[1:31:29] indicate that you can go in at all not
[1:31:33] because of that yes
[1:31:35] that has nothing to do with your soul

[1:32:22] the prophet received the baptism of the
[1:32:25] Holy Ghost had a barn
[1:32:26] he wasn't even at church

[1:32:35] for him to help you to forgive her
[1:32:37] person okay
