[46:52] cloud that brother brandom saw in his
[46:54] vision this prophecy took place on
[46:58] December 22
[47:01] 1962 months after that Vision a man
[47:06] named Dr James McDonald investigated the
[47:10] cloud and he said that it was too high
[47:16] for a jet to make it science could not
[47:20] explain the event the cloud was about 26
[47:24] mil long and 30 miles across this Cloud
[47:28] was 17 times higher than clouds can form
[47:34] and 15 miles higher than any airplane
[47:37] can fly This Cloud was
[47:41] Supernatural brother brandham said it
[47:44] was made by seven
[47:46] angels it was seen in a few different
[47:50] cities and three different states it
[47:53] traveled much faster than the wind speed
[47:57] that
[47:58] day there are many things that make this
[48:04] Cloud special I believe that the same
[48:07] Holy Ghost
[48:10] spirit that inspired the Bible gave
[48:13] brother
[48:14] brandham this Vision what does the cloud
[48:18] remind you of to me it looks like the
[48:22] face of our savior Christ
[48:26] I believe that it is a sign that God is
[48:31] always watching over us and that his
[48:35] return is near we must be very special
[48:39] to God because he Al allowed us to see
[48:45] this beautiful sign I hope these words
[48:48] give you Joy I'm going to read a
[48:54] quote brother Bram said on the

[53:42] power of the
[53:44] tongue whoa oh boy that's pretty that's
[53:48] pretty strong right our power our tongue

[55:15] how do we honor them we speak good words
[55:17] to them yes we speak so those that has
[55:21] power of of life and death and we've
[55:23] given a lot of examples of what the
[55:25] power of death is um have you ever heard
[55:29] who's heard this Saying sticks and
[55:31] stones may break my bones but words will
[55:33] never hurt me who's heard that it's a
[55:36] very very old phrase sticks I've heard
[55:39] it you've heard it yes sticks and stones
[55:42] will break my bones but words will never
[55:44] hurt me not true but the Bible says that
[55:48] it has power right Pepe has a lot of
[55:52] power and it hurts us more than sck
[55:54] Sticks and Stones because sticks and
[55:56] stones will heal from those things but a
[55:59] lot of times when we say something bad
[56:01] to our parents or we speak bad about our
[56:05] our our siblings or something like that
[56:07] that hurts them if we keep telling them
[56:10] oh you're short you're the shorty oh hey
[56:13] what's up shorty man that's going to
[56:15] stick with them oh man you're kind of
[56:18] slow you that's going that's really
[56:20] really going to hurt them and they're
[56:22] always going to think oh well I'm the
[56:23] slow one I can't run as fast as
[56:25] everybody else oh W I'm I'm the shorty
[56:29] here and they're always going to have
[56:31] that in their mind and that's speaking
[56:34] that's having the power of
[56:36] death what are the powers of the the uh
[56:40] Power of Life what what are words of
[56:43] life does any can anybody tell me
[56:46] Roberto like what give me an
[56:51] example oh I like that when somebody
[56:54] tells me that yeah God bless you
[56:56] Jeremiah that's a good one I love
[57:00] you you're doing good William God be
[57:05] with you anybody
[57:07] else
[57:10] Boaz how are you feeling o That's oh oh
[57:13] that opens the kind of works how are you
[57:15] feeling well brother let me tell you
[57:16] what let me tell you all about it what
[57:19] about you brother Pepe do you have any
[57:22] words of Life Words of Life are
[57:25] the word of God of oh speaking the word
[57:28] of God to somebody yes that is really
[57:31] good when you can speak the word of God
[57:34] and you can speak good words those are
[57:36] words of life and whenever we can tell
[57:39] our siblings man you're doing a good job
[57:42] man you look good today and you want to
[57:44] speak positive words it makes people
[57:46] feel good the
[57:49] Bible it says that God created the whole
[57:53] entire world now I know most of you
[57:56] young people you guys were in Sunday
[57:58] school but our brother Luis our
[58:00] associate pastor he preached a message
[58:02] about how the word is an original seed
[58:06] and he said how God created the whole
[58:10] entire world do you know how God created
[58:12] the whole entire
[58:13] world so so I saw brother Marcos brother
[58:17] Ramiro and brother Oscar and some other
[58:19] brothers I saw them build this in front
[58:21] of my eyes they Ed drills I they might
[58:25] have used a hammer they used other
[58:28] things so that they can build it so
[58:30] that's the tools we use to build houses
[58:33] and we build things but God uses a tool
[58:36] to build and create the whole entire
[58:39] world what is
[58:42] that can can everybody tell
[58:44] me his
[58:46] word that's how he created
[58:50] everything is by the words that he spoke
[58:54] the B the Bible tells
[58:56] us let no corrupt thing it's in
[58:59] Ephesians 4:29 it says let no corrupt
[59:02] thing or corrupt uh let no corrupting
[59:05] talk come out of your mouths but only
[59:09] such as is good for building up as fits
[59:14] the occasion that it may give grace to
[59:17] the
[59:18] hearer so there's three things that I
[59:21] see in that scripture first good good
[59:25] words positive words that we give to one
[59:27] another and we talk about one another it
[59:31] builds up we build up our friends we
[59:35] build up our family with positive and
[59:38] good words we build them up just like
[59:41] the brothers built this up just like God
[59:44] created the whole entire world by his
[59:47] good word we build up and we create good
[59:52] things by speaking good words to one
[59:55] another the second thing is it says as
[1:00:00] it is fit for the
[1:00:03] occasion what does that mean it means we
[1:00:07] speak when we're supposed
[1:00:09] to sometimes we want to just speak over
[1:00:12] other people sometimes sometimes we're
[1:00:15] talking and then you just so excited you
[1:00:16] want to talk talk to somebody and you
[1:00:18] speak over somebody or you want to get
[1:00:21] your point across so you just speak over
[1:00:23] people and or you say things when you're
[1:00:25] not supposed to the Bible says good
[1:00:29] words positive words you have to
[1:00:33] wait sometimes if you're having an
[1:00:35] argument with your brother or your
[1:00:37] sister if you're you're talking to them
[1:00:41] first a lot of times we want to speak
[1:00:43] over them and we want to say things and
[1:00:46] get our point across but sometimes we
[1:00:49] have to sit and we have to listen and
[1:00:53] maybe they say hey
[1:00:55] you did this and you did this and you're
[1:00:57] not waiting for your answer you're
[1:01:00] trying to understand them first that's
[1:01:04] what it means when it says speaking when
[1:01:06] it fits the occasion when you listen and
[1:01:10] you try to understand them then you have
[1:01:14] something to say in
[1:01:17] James it
[1:01:19] says understand this my dear brothers
[1:01:21] James 1:19 he says understand this my my
[1:01:24] dear brothers you must all be quick to
[1:01:29] listen are we quick to listen sometimes
[1:01:32] when mom wants us to clean the room when
[1:01:35] Mom says no you were wrong we're so
[1:01:37] quick to
[1:01:39] speak but the Bible says quick to
[1:01:43] listen then it
[1:01:46] says slow to
[1:01:49] speak and if you're slow to speak then
[1:01:51] you're slow to anger amen we don't want
[1:01:56] to let any anger in our lives but we
[1:01:59] want to control our words that we speak
[1:02:03] we have power in our words just like we
[1:02:06] heard brother Jeremiah those words are
[1:02:08] powerful that he said because he was
[1:02:10] speaking the word of God to us whenever
[1:02:13] we worship God just like our brother
[1:02:15] Andrew did those words are words of life
[1:02:20] and the Bible says praise to the Lord is
[1:02:22] like sweet smelling Sav to him he loves
[1:02:26] that he loves good words and good words
[1:02:30] are will build up somebody the third
[1:02:34] thing that Ephesians says that it may
[1:02:37] give Grace to those that
[1:02:40] hear now sometimes we might direct our
[1:02:43] our talk like I might be directing my
[1:02:45] talk to brother Pepe and I might be
[1:02:47] saying Pepe you were wrong here and you
[1:02:49] did this and you did that well it might
[1:02:52] hurt him but everybody else heard me
[1:02:55] too and now everybody else is affected
[1:02:59] not only Pepe but everybody else when
[1:03:03] we're yelling from one room to the other
[1:03:06] say no Mom I'm not going to clean my
[1:03:07] room and then everybody's like oh my
[1:03:10] goodness like oh we got to deal with
[1:03:12] that it affects
[1:03:15] everybody but when you speak and you
[1:03:17] speak directly to somebody it's giving
[1:03:19] Grace not only to the person you're
[1:03:21] speaking to but to everybody that he
[1:03:24] ears it gives
[1:03:26] Grace that's beautiful that's the power
[1:03:29] of your guys's words when you guys are
[1:03:31] at school and maybe somebody's bullying
[1:03:34] somebody or something is going on you
[1:03:37] can calm situations down you guys can
[1:03:40] make friends by the words that you speak
[1:03:43] by the things that you say it speaking
[1:03:47] life to people's lives the Bible says
[1:03:50] that our words are like seeds so we are
[1:03:53] just bunch of farmers we go with our
[1:03:56] seeds and if we're having a bad day
[1:03:58] we're planting bad seeds on everybody
[1:04:01] and we think everything is okay but
[1:04:03] they're all soil so they receive our
[1:04:05] seeds and it might be a seed of anger a
[1:04:09] seed of hatred whatever it might be but
[1:04:13] you're planting seeds in people and then
[1:04:15] they begin to grow according to what you
[1:04:17] tell
[1:04:18] them so that's why we have to speak
[1:04:22] words of life
[1:04:26] and we have to listen before we speak
[1:04:29] now now words of Life it'll give Grace
[1:04:32] to every single person now I'm not going
[1:04:35] to stick too long but brother um Ivan if
[1:04:39] you would like to pull up a a video who
[1:04:42] likes
[1:04:43] horses oh we love horses I got a little
[1:04:45] video of us just looking at some horses
[1:04:48] real quick and then I'll give you the
[1:04:49] context brother
[1:04:53] Ivan
[1:04:59] look how powerful those horses
[1:05:02] look as far as I know those are wild
[1:05:07] horses strong strong horses the Bible
[1:05:12] says in job 39:19 to 21 it says have you
[1:05:17] given power to the horse have you given
[1:05:20] the horse its strength or clothed its
[1:05:23] neck with flowing man did you give it
[1:05:26] the ability to LEAP like Locust it's
[1:05:29] Majestic snorting is it Majestic
[1:05:33] snorting is
[1:05:35] terrifying it's PAW it Paws the Earth
[1:05:38] and rejoices in its strength when it
[1:05:40] charges out to
[1:05:42] battle horses are very very strong
[1:05:46] creatures it it says that the average
[1:05:49] weight of an adult horse is about 900 to
[1:05:52] 2,000 lbs
[1:05:54] whoa that's a big animal right guys the
[1:05:58] average weight that a horse can carry is
[1:06:00] about 180 to 400
[1:06:04] lb so that's a that's a it could carry a
[1:06:08] lot so we think sometimes when we get if
[1:06:10] we if anybody's everever gotten a horse
[1:06:12] we might feel like like uh the horse is
[1:06:16] is probably his back is hurting because
[1:06:18] we're on it but no we're like a little
[1:06:20] feather to it that's how strong a horse
[1:06:23] is its kick is like 2,000 lb then you
[1:06:28] never want to get be behind a horse
[1:06:30] because he'll
[1:06:31] kick the power of it the horse bite it
[1:06:34] can chop your finger off so these are
[1:06:37] strong strong creatures very very strong
[1:06:41] but the reason why I'm saying this is
[1:06:43] because in
[1:06:45] James 3:2 it says indeed we all make
[1:06:50] mistakes for if we could control our
[1:06:53] tongues
[1:06:54] we could be perfect and could also
[1:06:57] control ourselves in every other way wow
[1:07:04] so if we could control our tongues first
[1:07:06] the Bible says first we can be
[1:07:09] perfect second we can control ourselves
[1:07:12] our body in any way we we want because
[1:07:16] we control this little guy it says in in
[1:07:20] verse three it says we can make a large
[1:07:23] horse go wherever we want by means of a
[1:07:27] small bit in his mouth so imagine who
[1:07:31] can push a horse down let me see Hands
[1:07:34] raised not you Pepe I know you can
[1:07:37] but oh
[1:07:40] okay who can who do you think um can
[1:07:44] withstand the kick of a
[1:07:46] horse ad Mano
[1:07:49] Lise um who do you think can pull and
[1:07:54] win a Tuggle war with a
[1:07:56] horse I don't know maybe brother Lu
[1:07:58] brother B and brother Pepe but I don't
[1:08:00] know about anybody
[1:08:03] else but they're strong creatures we
[1:08:07] can't overpower a horse right guys
[1:08:10] they're too strong they carry 2 thou or
[1:08:12] they're about
[1:08:14] 2,000 pounds of weight but it says one
[1:08:18] little thing can control everything be
[1:08:20] do you have that thing that I told you
[1:08:21] to hold for me yeah do hold on one
[1:08:24] second one okay all right I know it's a
[1:08:26] little
[1:08:31] heavy one
[1:08:34] second one moment and don't don't it's
[1:08:36] not a horse okay
[1:08:38] guys all right buddy oh my goodness
[1:08:42] okay what is
[1:08:47] this you all right you almost took me oh
[1:08:52] sorry what is
[1:08:56] this for
[1:08:59] horses to make them go
[1:09:01] faster what is
[1:09:04] it it's a
[1:09:06] bridal she's right the Bible calls it a
[1:09:10] bit so you have the
[1:09:12] rains oh man I already forgot about this
[1:09:15] brother Junior told me brother Junior
[1:09:16] sanchz this is his he told me what this
[1:09:19] was I forgot but this part is the bit
[1:09:24] this part right here goes in the horse's
[1:09:27] mouth right here this little tiny thing
[1:09:30] is it bigger than a
[1:09:32] horse oh no we can I could throw it I
[1:09:36] could probably throw it pretty far too
[1:09:38] but it's not that big but this little
[1:09:42] bit the Bible says is like our
[1:09:45] tongue it's got power to control that
[1:09:49] big animal that we saw running in the
[1:09:52] fields that that big animal that we
[1:09:55] can't man we can't fight a horse and win
[1:09:58] no those big Majestic animals this
[1:10:02] little tiny thing will control the whole
[1:10:05] entire
[1:10:07] horse and the Bible says that our tongue
[1:10:10] is like this little bit that it'll
[1:10:13] control our whole lives our whole body
[1:10:16] our wherever we go it'll control
[1:10:20] us but it says if we can control this
[1:10:23] thing which is the tongue then we can
[1:10:27] control our
[1:10:29] bodies so the the the horse is easily
[1:10:34] maneuvered it becomes a very docile and
[1:10:36] very friendly creature yes
[1:10:42] Andrew right it's it's whoever is
[1:10:46] controlling the the bridal because
[1:10:49] that's controlling the horse this is I
[1:10:52] believe on his ear
[1:10:54] and then you're holding the reins like
[1:10:56] this it depends on who is holding the
[1:11:00] reins that controls that
[1:11:03] tongue right so it's it's God's spirit
[1:11:08] we're asking for the Lord to control and
[1:11:11] say Lord you put the words of God in my
[1:11:14] mouth Lord because I know if you can
[1:11:16] control this Bridal or this bit or this
[1:11:19] tongue Lord it'll control my whole life
[1:11:22] the Bible says if you can control your
[1:11:24] tongue you can be perfect and control
[1:11:27] everything about your
[1:11:28] life so it's whenever the I I know in
[1:11:33] school I don't know if you guys ever
[1:11:34] heard this but sometimes I'd get really
[1:11:36] angry by God's grace God changed me but
[1:11:39] I would get mad and I would want to say
[1:11:41] something to uh one of my
[1:11:45] schoolmates and my teacher would say if
[1:11:48] you don't have anything good to say
[1:11:51] don't say anything at all
[1:11:54] and sometimes we just want to blur
[1:11:56] something bad at somebody but if we
[1:11:58] don't have anything good it's better to
[1:12:00] control that tongue it's better to
[1:12:02] control our words and then whenever
[1:12:05] we're calm we're we're slow and we're
[1:12:08] quick to hear and we're slow to anger
[1:12:11] then we can speak speak out of love
[1:12:15] speak out of kindness knowing that our
[1:12:18] words have
[1:12:20] power and if if I say something bad
[1:12:24] it's going to hurt that person and maybe
[1:12:27] they'll say God bless you but they
[1:12:28] always feel hurt about it the Bible also
[1:12:32] says that the big ships that are
[1:12:34] controlled in the
[1:12:36] waves it's controlled by a little tiny
[1:12:38] Helm a little steering wheel these huge
[1:12:41] huge ships are controlled by a little
[1:12:45] tiny steering wheel so it's important
[1:12:49] what we do and how we speak to one
[1:12:52] another whether it's it's our family
[1:12:54] whether it's our friends at school
[1:12:56] whether it's somebody in church whatever
[1:12:59] it might be when we can give words of
[1:13:02] life and we can build up just like God
[1:13:05] did we can create good worlds and good
[1:13:10] things everything that God spoke do you
[1:13:12] know what he
[1:13:13] said whenever he he created the sky and
[1:13:16] the light in the darkness what did he
[1:13:18] say after he created everything this is
[1:13:21] kind of a hard question
[1:13:30] good job man he's good he said it is
[1:13:34] good everything he created he saw it
[1:13:37] because he spoke it and he said Ah
[1:13:39] that's good and ever whenever we talk to
[1:13:42] one another and we have good friends and
[1:13:45] we have good talking to one another we
[1:13:47] can say Ah that's good speak good words
[1:13:51] of
[1:13:51] Life the Bible also says while I'm
[1:13:54] closing here Pepe I'll I'll give this
[1:13:57] back to you let's see there there you go
[1:14:00] you take control of
[1:14:01] that but the Bible says that we can
[1:14:05] control every animal in the Earth did
[1:14:08] you know that guys what's a what's a
[1:14:11] ferocious animal a scary animal can
[1:14:13] somebody tell me
[1:14:16] Boos
[1:14:18] crocodile that's
[1:14:20] scary yes brother a a Bo
[1:14:25] a
[1:14:27] lion
[1:14:29] lion a
[1:14:32] jackal an
[1:14:34] ox any anything
[1:14:38] else oh what oh my goodness I can't even
[1:14:42] pronounce that word say it
[1:14:45] louder okay all right I can't I
[1:14:48] tried yeah
[1:14:50] boys all right
[1:14:56] oh my goodness three in
[1:15:00] one yes oh
[1:15:04] yes what a bull oh who who knows who
[1:15:10] controlled a bull with
[1:15:12] love brother
[1:15:14] brandom so so all of these animals how
[1:15:19] ferocious they are horses Lions whatever
[1:15:23] our brother said all of these things the
[1:15:26] Bible says we can all control
[1:15:29] them but we can't control our
[1:15:33] tongue
[1:15:34] wow so that's why in Jeremiah 1:9 it
[1:15:39] says then the Lord reached out and
[1:15:41] touched my
[1:15:43] mouth he
[1:15:45] said look I have put my words in your
[1:15:52] mouth and if we can go every single day
[1:15:55] saying Lord put your words in my mouth
[1:15:59] let me say something good to my friends
[1:16:01] let me say something good to my mom and
[1:16:04] my dad let me say something good
[1:16:08] Proverbs 1624 it says kind words are
[1:16:11] like honey who loves honey I love
[1:16:16] honey they're why are they like honey
[1:16:19] because they're sweet to the soul and
[1:16:22] healthy for for the
[1:16:24] body so good words and kind words heal
[1:16:29] people you want healing we want healing
[1:16:32] in our lives you want healing for your
[1:16:35] friends speak good
[1:16:37] words and they're more powerful than we
[1:16:39] even think so that's all I have just so
[1:16:43] that we can have good words for one
[1:16:45] another and whenever you see a friend or
[1:16:48] you see somebody even maybe somebody
[1:16:49] that doesn't like you too much you could
[1:16:51] say God bless you brother I love you God
[1:16:55] bless you sister I love you and project
[1:16:59] the love of God to each and every person
[1:17:03] Amen Let Us bow our heads and then as as

[1:19:12] hello there and welcome to JTC news I am
[1:19:16] Ezra your host for tonight and I hope
[1:19:18] you all have had a blessed Sunday and I
[1:19:20] am so glad to have you all tuned in for
[1:19:22] tonight broadcast because it is a
[1:19:24] special one now I would like to start
[1:19:27] off by thanking Hester's workshop for
[1:19:29] building us this wonderful set don't you
[1:19:31] guys find it so cute because personally
[1:19:34] I am in love now to start off today's
[1:19:37] broadcast I would like to thank all the
[1:19:39] wonderful brothers that came to our
[1:19:40] church and blessed us with all the god L
[1:19:44] preachings that I am sure we can all
[1:19:46] agree were a tremendous blessing on
[1:19:48] January 12th brother George Smith gave
[1:19:50] us a wonderful testimony and I don't
[1:19:52] know what he
[1:19:54] said but I was there for a
[1:19:58] reason I wanted to get closer to his
[1:20:02] daughter now at that point i' had
[1:20:04] already read my Bible all the way
[1:20:08] through and I didn't know what this
[1:20:13] conversation was really all about but he
[1:20:14] was very
[1:20:19] nice but later I
[1:20:21] realized
[1:20:23] that during this
[1:20:25] conversation he was scanning the hard
[1:20:31] drive and he could see the whole
[1:20:34] picture I didn't know
[1:20:36] that but when we finished talking I had
[1:20:39] the
[1:20:42] Victory and he had the
[1:20:45] problem on December 12th we had brother
[1:20:48] Tito who preached a powerful
[1:20:51] message we talk about the 10 version
[1:20:53] about the foolish
[1:20:55] versions I remember all of
[1:20:58] that and when I go back into my
[1:21:03] memory I'm proud of what I did for
[1:21:07] God proud that I gave my life to the
[1:21:12] Lord I'm proud that I did what I could
[1:21:15] for
[1:21:17] him but there's something within me now
[1:21:20] that
[1:21:21] says what about these years what about
[1:21:25] these moments what about this day and
[1:21:29] most recently we had brother Frank bless
[1:21:31] us with a heartfelt
[1:21:35] preaching brothers and sisters but I'll
[1:21:38] tell you one thing
[1:21:39] tonight I believe God has done something
[1:21:42] in our
[1:21:43] hearts I believe that even those it's
[1:21:45] for a few
[1:21:47] minutes I believe you've
[1:21:50] understood what God thinks of you
[1:21:53] there's no
[1:21:54] mistakes God never made a mistake with
[1:21:57] you Brothers God never made a
[1:22:02] mistake I will tell you something you
[1:22:05] tell and stick that in the devil's face
[1:22:08] God did not make a
[1:22:12] mistake now I would like to say happy
[1:22:16] anniversary to our beautiful church
[1:22:18] building of 4 years oh my gosh I'm
[1:22:21] pretty sure half of you guys were and
[1:22:22] diapers back then now here's a video of
[1:22:25] our founding Pastor opening the doors of
[1:22:27] our church for the first
[1:22:37] [Applause]
[1:22:44] [Music]
[1:22:50] time now wasn't that a wonderful memory
[1:22:52] to revisit now we will be back after
[1:22:55] this short commercial
[1:22:58] break in a journey with God we discover
[1:23:01] how simple it can be to wander off from
[1:23:03] his loving
[1:23:06] path what is
[1:23:21] that
[1:23:34] anything for that party come
[1:23:40] on there's a party got to be some this
[1:23:44] something that hurts
[1:23:48] me like a good Savior Jesus is there
[1:23:54] let's
[1:23:56] go God is our refuge and strength always
[1:24:00] ready to help in times of trouble so
[1:24:03] don't forget to call on the name of
[1:24:09] Jesus it's always good to have a
[1:24:11] reminder that just a simple call and our
[1:24:13] savior will be there to help us out of
[1:24:15] trouble now for our last segment
[1:24:18] something I am so excited to talk to you
[1:24:19] all about and that is
[1:24:24] hey guys we're reporting from Pulpit
[1:24:26] Rock located in Northern Tucson
[1:24:28] otherwise known as Sabino cannon with my
[1:24:32] cameraman it was at this very spot that
[1:24:34] God gave brother Brandon the sword of
[1:24:36] the of the King on January of 1963 and a
[1:24:39] month later he was raptured up to the
[1:24:41] sky in the famous Cloud about another 4
[1:24:43] 41 miles Northeast from here then
[1:24:45] another month later he returned to
[1:24:47] Jeffersonville to preach the Seven Seals
[1:24:50] and now we are going to take it back to
[1:24:51] the station with Ezra so she can tell us
[1:24:53] a little bit more about the cloud back
[1:24:55] to you thanks Kenny for giving it back
[1:24:58] to my show anyways back to what I was
[1:25:01] talking about my favorite topic for
[1:25:03] tonight and that is is the amazing
[1:25:07] Arizona phenomenon the cloud or that
[1:25:10] weird Arizona calls it the Ring of
[1:25:11] mystery this phenomenon appeared 61
[1:25:14] years ago which is kind of old but I
[1:25:19] also have something pretty special to
[1:25:21] show you guys and that is is a original
[1:25:23] copy of the Life Magazine with the cloud
[1:25:26] article and I brought it here to show
[1:25:27] you all one really interesting thing
[1:25:30] about this image is that if you turn it
[1:25:32] on its side you see its true form like
[1:25:35] brother bandham said said to me turn it
[1:25:39] right I think I'm looking at it right
[1:25:42] said turn it
[1:25:45] right I thought maybe that voice needs
[1:25:47] turn it to the right and when it did you
[1:25:50] see what it is hofman's head of Christ
[1:25:53] at 33 here look in here see his black
[1:25:56] beard his face his eyes his nose and
[1:25:57] everything else see the part of his hair
[1:25:59] here come and he's wigged with
[1:26:02] that white angel
[1:26:05] wig to show that the message of him
[1:26:09] being God is the
[1:26:11] truth well that's all we have for
[1:26:14] tonight guys I hope you all have a
[1:26:16] blessed day and a good night and that is
