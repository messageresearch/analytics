[35:31] open up our scriptures in the book of
[35:33] Saint Marks
[35:38] the eighth chapter the 34th verse
[35:45] um I'd like to thank our pastor Brothers
[35:46] for the trust he allows us to speak to
[35:50] the to the youth tonight

[35:58] single one of you
[36:02] amen if you have it if you can please
[36:05] say Amen
[36:07] it's nice that there's still people that
[36:10] have Bibles
[36:12] [Music]
[36:14] you know sometimes in the audience you
[36:16] see people with their phones
[36:20] but it's nice to have the old-fashioned
[36:22] Bible
[36:26] and it says like this
[36:28] and when he had called the people onto
[36:31] him with his disciples also he said unto
[36:34] them whosoever will come after me let
[36:37] him deny himself take up his cross and
[36:40] follow me
[36:42] [Music]
[36:48] for whosoever will save his life shall
[36:52] lose it but whosoever shall lose his
[36:55] life for my sake and the gospels the
[36:58] same shall save it
[37:09] for what shall a prophet a man if he
[37:12] gain the whole world and lose his own
[37:14] soul soul
[37:15] foreign
[37:24] [Music]
[37:27] whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of
[37:31] me and of my words and this adulterous
[37:34] and sinful generation of him also shall
[37:37] the son of man be ashamed when he cometh
[37:40] in the glory of his father with his Holy
[37:42] Angels
[37:56] amen you may take your seats
[37:59] like to thank our musicians and our Our
[38:02] Song leaders
[38:07] in every single one of you for for
[38:09] welcoming the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:14] are you really happy to be be here in
[38:16] the house of the Lord tonight
[38:19] amen that's a really good thing to be in
[38:22] the house of the Lord
[38:25] and find ourselves here on Friday night
[38:30] it's nice that the young people are here
[38:33] it's nice that the parents are
[38:35] accompanying their young people
[38:39] it's very beautiful to see that yes
[38:44] our title our subject for tonight
[38:48] very simple down to earth message
[38:53] I would like to entitle it as Are you
[38:56] ashamed of Jesus Christ
[39:01] it's a question that's being asked
[39:04] and if there's a question there has to
[39:07] be an answer
[39:09] and the question is or are you ashamed
[39:12] of Jesus Christ
[39:16] a lot of people today aren't ashamed of
[39:18] Jesus Christ
[39:22] may the Lord help us tonight
[39:27] um here I got some some definitions
[39:31] definitions and I as you've noticed my
[39:34] pattern on how I am you see
[39:37] yeah
[39:39] I like to get the definition I like to
[39:42] look for synonyms
[39:45] to to grab or understand the scriptures
[39:49] or brother Branham a lot more better
[39:51] foreign
[40:09] [Music]
[40:40] in other words you're embarrassed
[40:42] because you're you're you're you're
[40:43] you're you're associated with this group
[40:50] you feel shame a disgrace
[40:54] and the synonyms
[40:57] you're regretful is
[41:01] you're uncomfortable
[41:03] you're humiliated
[41:06] I hope we don't feel like that when it
[41:08] comes down to the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:13] but I believe that each and every single
[41:15] one of us here
[41:17] has felt a certain shame
[41:21] or certain embarrassment
[41:25] as we're growing up
[41:27] and as a young young folks the young
[41:30] people in Los hovenes as they're going
[41:33] to school
[41:35] and you know as you know when they're
[41:37] here as little kids at church
[41:40] it's normal it's normal it's common for
[41:44] the young ladies to wear skirts
[41:48] not wear any makeup and for the young
[41:51] man not to speak on a foul language
[41:56] but the moment when they get into that
[41:59] middle school age of six to eight seven
[42:02] eighth grade
[42:06] elementary
[42:08] but I wouldn't be surprised if that
[42:10] happens today
[42:14] but they start to ask why do you wear
[42:17] skirts
[42:20] and that question brings us a form of
[42:23] embarrassment yes
[42:27] you feel uncomfortable
[42:30] because you don't want to if you feel
[42:33] odd and out of place
[42:37] man why don't you why don't you come
[42:39] with us to the movie theaters on Friday
[42:41] nights
[42:45] why don't you talk like this
[42:48] and it brings us a certain form of being
[42:51] uncomfortable
[42:55] because you're associating with the
[42:59] Christians today
[43:02] and there you begin to have this complex
[43:07] that are you ashamed of Jesus Christ
[43:13] we hear stories and testimonies sisters
[43:20] today
[43:22] when they were younger
[43:24] we hear stories that when they would uh
[43:27] have their have their skirts on uh
[43:32] underneath they'll have pants
[43:35] and once they got to school foreign
[43:49] and I believe that each and every single
[43:52] one of us has felt a certain shame
[43:57] but I we shouldn't be ashamed of Jesus
[44:00] Christ
[44:02] and hopefully by the end of tonight
[44:08] each and every single one of us and the
[44:11] young people especially
[44:13] to carry the cross and not be ashamed of
[44:16] Jesus Christ
[44:20] now we're going to read a quote here
[44:23] he says now the word of Shame could be
[44:27] translated as embarrassed
[44:31] you know something that something your
[44:34] face was something that you're
[44:35] embarrassed about being ashamed
[44:42] then another thing being ashamed does
[44:46] it shows that you're not sure what
[44:49] you're talking about
[44:52] if you know what you're talking about
[44:56] and have the assurance that you know
[44:58] what you're talking about
[45:02] you can tell anybody that
[45:05] you're not ashamed
[45:08] but you feel you feel put out out of
[45:11] place
[45:13] it shows that you're not sure
[45:17] so the prophet is telling us the one of
[45:19] the reasons why we feel ashamed
[45:24] because we're not sure and what we
[45:27] believe in is
[45:30] we're not sure of what we what we are
[45:33] here at church
[45:37] your parents know why they're here
[45:41] your parents know who they're believing
[45:44] in is
[45:46] but the question is do you know what
[45:49] you're believing in
[45:51] do you know uh why we're here
[45:56] because that's why we fall ashamed when
[45:59] the question is asked to us at
[46:02] schools
[46:06] why don't you do this why don't you do
[46:08] this
[46:10] because you're not sure
[46:15] when you have an insurance
[46:18] you know what you're talking about
[46:21] you're not embarrassed to tell them what
[46:23] you believe in notes
[46:26] but until that moment
[46:30] you're only barring your parents
[46:32] convictions
[46:36] Padre
[46:41] amen
[46:46] is
[46:51] notice today if someone says are you
[46:54] I don't know
[46:58] it's a very much a popular thing
[47:02] oh I'm a
[47:05] Christianity for the very very popular
[47:08] today
[47:09] this is 19 65 we're talking about
[47:15] bring it here in a 2023.
[47:21] say something very raw and directly
[47:26] but you have these people who are uh
[47:30] homosexuals today existence
[47:35] who are transgenders today
[47:40] Cristiano
[47:42] barriers are ashamed to say that they're
[47:44] Christians
[47:52] Christianity
[47:58] someone who says they're a Christian is
[48:10] a lot of fake bills muchos
[48:18] if there's a Fool's Gold it's a you know
[48:20] because there's a real goal is
[48:25] everybody
[48:34] to make that real Christian stand out
[48:37] even more is
[48:41] but do you believe the word of God
[48:48] the question is
[48:53] how do you believe the word of God
[48:58] I said these signs are foreign
[49:11] [Music]
[49:21] Are you ashamed of your Pentecost
[49:23] Pentecostal experience

[49:33] his word is
[49:38] we're ashamed
[49:42] I don't have this quote up there all
[49:44] right
[49:52] Jesus said Jesus now if you're ashamed
[49:56] of me
[49:57] then I'll be ashamed of you
[50:01] why would he be ashamed of you
[50:07] is because you're claiming to be his
[50:09] porque this is
[50:13] when you won't follow him
[50:16] that's why the scripture tells us
[50:19] foreign
[50:21] [Music]

[54:32] failures
[54:41] it was as Crimson
[54:45] brother Branham here talking about the
[54:49] prodigal son
[54:52] and you can go back to the message I'm
[54:54] gonna omit a lot of things
[54:58] and the message
[55:03] here the young man is is told his dad
[55:07] brother Ram brings a real tremendous
[55:09] scene is
[55:13] he breaks it down almost in details
[55:17] how he tells us that how he approached
[55:19] his dad
[55:21] how he wanted his inheritance
[55:24] and he went to his mom now there's a
[55:27] couple of things here omitted but you
[55:29] can go back to the message
[55:33] and now I can hear him saying
[56:31] amen amen
[56:33] I can't see her I can see her put her
[56:38] arms around him
[56:41] she would hug him
[56:47] I used to do that you want this she'll
[56:51] grab me she'll grabs the mom grabbed the
[56:53] Prodigal Son
[56:55] hugged him
[57:01] he don't want a kiss in public
[57:05] I remember when my mom had dropped me
[57:07] off at school
[57:10] she said
[57:14] all my friends were there
[57:19] brother Ram says no affections
[57:22] the Bible said they would be this way
[57:26] Paul speaks it without natural affection
[57:31] that's the way it is today yes
[57:34] the child rules the home
[57:39] now instead of the father and the mother
[57:43] they're the one who does the talking
[57:46] it's a shame without natural affections
[57:50] I can see her I could see the mother Pat
[57:54] his cheeks
[57:56] and the kids
[58:02] you know I I I I I don't think there was
[58:04] a time
[58:06] that my mom asked me a question
[58:10] do you want to go to church today
[58:16] my mom would say
[58:17] we're going to church let's go
[58:20] you don't have an option alternative she
[58:24] would say as long as you live in this
[58:27] house
[58:32] the day you get your house
[58:37] but you live here
[58:40] you're coming boy Muchachos you think I
[58:44] was there oh yes Mom yeah I'm going
[58:49] God I gotta go to church again
[58:57] how many you can say Amen
[59:00] I never was asked the question if I
[59:02] wanted to go to church
[59:05] now the parents say do you want to go to
[59:08] God is
[59:21] look young folks
[59:36] that old dad that you were ashamed of
[59:39] him
[59:42] just because he goes to church
[59:46] and maybe gets happy and shouts in a
[59:48] while he says
[59:51] and that boyfriend or girlfriend of
[59:53] yours in church will say yes
[59:56] [Music]
[1:00:03] adios
[1:00:07] and you're just a little bit ashamed of
[1:00:09] him
[1:00:11] saying that your mom because she
[1:00:13] worshiped in church
[1:00:16] there will be a time
[1:00:19] when you won't be ashamed of him
[1:00:22] you're going to be thankful with God
[1:00:25] if you had a mother that took you to
[1:00:28] church
[1:00:34] even though you didn't want to go to
[1:00:36] church
[1:00:37] he took you to church even though he
[1:00:41] knew
[1:00:42] that you are probably going to go to the
[1:00:44] world
[1:00:45] but he did his job as a father
[1:00:50] she did his job as a mother
[1:00:53] bring you as much as she could to the
[1:00:55] house of God
[1:00:57] I believe I'm thankful for that is
[1:01:07] a mother that took us to church even
[1:01:09] though now
[1:01:20] brother Ram says talking about being
[1:01:23] assure what you're talking about
[1:01:27] I have an experience with the Lord
[1:01:31] we're ashamed of him foreign
[1:02:22] that not even do will fall from Heaven
[1:02:25] until you call foreign
[1:03:20] say what God said
[1:03:23] no he wasn't like an 80 year old man
[1:03:27] he was walking like a 16 year old boy
[1:03:33] walked right up in the presence of the
[1:03:35] king and said
[1:03:38] not even do come from Heaven until I
[1:03:41] call foreign
[1:03:50] [Music]

[1:05:22] nothing to do with him I'm not ashamed
[1:05:26] of the word of God
[1:05:28] not ashamed of your commissions
[1:05:42] the only shame that I am
[1:05:46] what
[1:06:07] pero as his servant
[1:06:10] I'm not ashamed
[1:06:13] I'm not ashamed of his words
[1:06:25] just be ready to give an answer
[1:06:29] God calls foreign
[1:07:07] prophetas
[1:07:59] they said Do you believe the prophet
[1:08:02] I know that you believe the proper radio
[1:08:14] says the king says
[1:08:19] persuade me to be a
[1:08:23] Christianity
[1:08:25] not ashamed to stand for the gospel of
[1:08:27] Christ
[1:08:38] he said he did everything what they said
[1:08:42] this I'll dress like this
[1:08:45] talk like this I'll talk like this
[1:08:48] every single stage
[1:08:51] so when it got to the moment
[1:08:59] foreign
[1:09:30] let's have some exercises in the Bible
[1:09:34] let's see how quickly we can turn to
[1:09:36] them
[1:09:38] I was thinking the other day of talking
[1:09:41] to brother Octavio and and see if you
[1:09:43] approve this
[1:09:47] I was thinking just to tell him
[1:09:50] something funny I guess I can say
[1:09:52] something like that
[1:09:55] we don't put the scriptures up here no
[1:09:57] more
[1:09:59] so now we can bring our Bibles to church
[1:10:03] now with a pen on the screen
[1:10:06] now all right First Peter chapter four
[1:10:11] verse 12.
[1:10:13] beloved I think think not strange
[1:10:16] concerning the far a trial which is to
[1:10:19] try you he said
[1:10:24] as though some strange thing happened to
[1:10:27] you
[1:10:29] now notice notice how the Bible is
[1:10:33] written
[1:10:35] notice every comma
[1:10:37] every period because
[1:10:47] thinking not strange concerning the
[1:10:49] fiery trial which is betrayal
[1:10:55] so don't don't find it strange or odd
[1:10:59] while you're going through some trials
[1:11:06] and there's something strange is
[1:11:08] happening to you like you're not like an
[1:11:10] oddball
[1:11:14] don't don't don't find it strange
[1:11:18] you accept the Lord Jesus Christ foreign
[1:11:27] [Applause]
[1:11:32] [Applause]
[1:11:57] when his when his glory shall be
[1:11:59] revealed
[1:12:02] Gloria ye may be glad also with
[1:12:05] exceeding Joy says
[1:12:07] if he be reproached for the name of
[1:12:10] Christ
[1:12:13] now if you are a reproached in other
[1:12:16] words like being ashamed or you're found
[1:12:18] guilty this is
[1:12:22] for the name of Christ foreign
[1:12:57] foreign
[1:13:01] [Music]
[1:13:36] that's what the scripture is telling me
[1:13:39] 16.
[1:13:40] yet if any man suffer as a
[1:13:46] Christiano let him not be ashamed
[1:13:50] what's what the scripture is telling us
[1:13:52] if you're suffering as a Christian
[1:13:56] praying for the criticism because
[1:13:57] because you wear skirts
[1:14:01] because instead of going on Fridays you
[1:14:03] go to church on Friday yeah
[1:14:11] let him not be ashamed
[1:14:15] but let him be glorified in God you know
[1:14:18] glorifices
[1:14:21] now let's go to First Timothy
[1:14:24] motel that's first Timothy and second
[1:14:27] Timothy or one of my favorite Bibles
[1:14:30] scriptures in the Bible
[1:14:36] here Timothy Motel
[1:14:41] brother Branham would say many occasions
[1:14:45] he was the the beloved Son of Paul
[1:14:50] he was the like the
[1:14:52] the person that was always with Paul
[1:14:56] he carried his coat
[1:14:59] make sure that he didn't need anything
[1:15:01] Timothy was ready there to help Paulo
[1:15:05] there's a message where brother Graham
[1:15:07] says Paul would be preaching in the cold
[1:15:09] this is
[1:15:12] Timothy will be ready to have his coat
[1:15:15] ready to put it on him
[1:15:20] Paul was his teacher
[1:15:23] Maestro so here I like how the letters
[1:15:27] are to Timothy
[1:15:28] is
[1:15:30] now notice first Timothy 4 12.
[1:15:35] he says he said let no man despise thy
[1:15:40] use
[1:15:42] but beat down example of the Believers
[1:15:45] and were in conversation and charity and
[1:15:47] spirit and faith and impurities
[1:16:08] because you're young
[1:16:12] man amen brother Rams on a Wednesday
[1:16:15] Tate brother Brown was preaching
[1:16:16] preaching spiritual food in the due
[1:16:18] season in Miracles
[1:16:23] he says God can ripen a seed however he
[1:16:26] wants and he said
[1:16:29] whoever he wants to raise up
[1:16:33] I've been here for 40 years foreign
[1:17:00] [Music]
[1:17:35] it's not time to give me fruits
[1:17:39] but I want you to give me fruit right

[1:17:43] that's how it is
[1:17:46] but I'm not ready yet oh I'm telling
[1:17:49] Jesus Christ is telling you I want fruit
[1:17:51] right now
[1:17:54] right now and the tree rejected it
[1:17:58] and when they left and came back foreign
[1:18:15] it says don't let anyone look down on
[1:18:17] you because you're young they said
[1:18:21] let no man despise thy youth okay
[1:18:26] he says but
[1:18:28] be an example to the Believers
[1:18:39] how do you talk
[1:18:41] how do you talk in church is it
[1:18:45] different how you talk at home
[1:18:50] be an example to the Believers he says
[1:18:54] and how you talk in palabra and
[1:19:06] be an example how you talk in conduct
[1:19:09] you know him
[1:19:11] love and faith

[1:19:45] okay
[1:19:47] something from God
[1:19:49] don't neglected don't let it goes

[1:21:08] and it says on to the doctrine
[1:21:12] what is Doctrine Doctrine is
[1:21:17] the Gospel of Jesus Christ

[1:22:25] says
[1:22:28] for I am not ashamed of the gospel of
[1:22:32] Christ
[1:22:36] now you've noticed those points right
[1:22:38] there
[1:22:39] that means it's an answer is
[1:22:43] amen amen now he says from not ashamed
[1:22:47] of the gospel of Christ
[1:22:51] I'm not a smart person myself I don't
[1:22:54] know what was though things are called
[1:22:58] but I know that means there's an answer
[1:23:01] that's coming
[1:23:04] amen amen uh young people you know what

[1:23:09] I mean there's an answer significance
[1:23:12] for it is power of God unto salvation

[1:23:23] now it is
[1:23:26] and it's salvation to everyone that
[1:23:29] believes
[1:23:32] that's why we shouldn't be ashamed of
[1:23:34] the Gospel foreign
[1:24:06] foreign
[1:24:29] faith that is in thee
[1:24:32] Memorial
[1:24:35] first and thy grandmother Lois and my
[1:24:38] mother Eunice and I am I'm persuaded
[1:24:40] that is indeed also
[1:24:50] he's making reference to his mom and to
[1:24:53] his grandmother

[1:25:01] that took care of their household
[1:25:04] and raised up a Timothy Mateo
[1:25:09] man amen
[1:25:11] now verse 6
[1:25:13] wherefore I put thee in remembrance that
[1:25:17] thou stir up the gift of God
[1:25:26] because in the first chapter excuse me
[1:25:29] the first Timothy he says neglect not
[1:25:31] the gifts
[1:25:35] and on this book he says I put you in
[1:25:39] remembrance
[1:25:43] stir up the gift of God
[1:25:47] don't start stirring it up so you have
[1:25:51] the gift of sing and stir up the gifts
[1:25:58] to interpreting stir up together
[1:26:02] don't neglect the gift that is in you
[1:26:05] know this
[1:26:07] now and first first Timothy and second
[1:26:10] Timothy
[1:26:12] he says and putting in the head and
[1:26:15] putting on of hands if you saying
[1:26:17] position now you're saying brother
[1:26:19] Louise that you can just pray over me
[1:26:21] lay hands and I'll have a certain gifts
[1:26:30] and colleagues are without repentance
[1:26:34] you already had that gift
[1:26:37] but when he's talking about putting in
[1:26:39] the hands
[1:26:46] you're approving it is
[1:26:50] now when you see the ministers come up
[1:26:52] you were about anointed Minister
[1:27:01] we're not making him a minister
[1:27:05] before the foundation of the world
[1:27:17] for God hath not given us the spirit of
[1:27:20] fear is
[1:27:30] those three things he says
[1:27:33] what powers are you talking about
[1:27:35] the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:38] the power is referring to yeah
[1:27:46] what is what love isn't referring
[1:27:49] and a sound mind it is now
[1:27:55] I wish I could get into that but yeah
[1:28:01] Lord help us because in Spanish in
[1:28:04] English it's two different things
[1:28:09] and in Spanish
[1:28:16] we're just running out of time
[1:28:20] but be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[1:28:24] testimony of the Lord this important
[1:28:28] remember Paul uh Paul is like the
[1:28:32] spiritual father to Timothy all right
[1:28:36] you'll hear about the ram make
[1:28:37] references you're a mice children in the
[1:28:39] gospel
[1:28:40] references
[1:28:53] now when Paul was writing these letters
[1:29:01] he was writing these letters in Rome
[1:29:05] I wish we could get into this
[1:29:07] and he said remember we said
[1:29:12] in the testimony of the Lord
[1:29:16] foreign
[1:29:18] [Music]
[1:30:06] take that to modern day today
[1:30:11] don't be ashamed of the testimonials
[1:30:20] carry the reproach
[1:30:23] that Paul's in prison
[1:30:27] he said I'm not a prisoner of Romeo
[1:30:31] Paul will never say Paul prisoner of
[1:30:33] Rome
[1:30:35] you must say Paul prisoner of Christ
[1:30:39] even though he was locked up in Rome
[1:30:43] not a prisoner of Rome
[1:30:46] he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:30:52] where he was at didn't mean he was a
[1:30:55] prisoner of Rome
[1:30:57] significance
[1:31:02] don't be ashamed of me either
[1:31:07] carry the
[1:31:12] [Music]

[1:32:48] but be thou partakers of the afflictions
[1:33:04] holy calling
[1:33:06] not according to our works
[1:33:09] but according to his own purpose
[1:33:16] which was given given to us in Christ
[1:33:19] Jesus
[1:33:21] before until the world began
[1:33:25] this is not because of my work
[1:33:28] this is because of his own purpose
[1:33:32] his grace
[1:33:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:33:44] brother Graham says Lee Cinema Branham I
[1:33:47] want from this night on

[1:35:13] I've been ashamed to talk to the group
[1:35:18] to the boys I run around with all the
[1:35:20] girls Muchachos
[1:35:23] from this night on
[1:35:26] Jesus Jesus I'm going to talk about you
[1:35:31] I'm going to testify of you everywhere
[1:35:39] there's someone here a young man a young
[1:35:42] lady

[1:36:46] be ashamed of the Gospel
