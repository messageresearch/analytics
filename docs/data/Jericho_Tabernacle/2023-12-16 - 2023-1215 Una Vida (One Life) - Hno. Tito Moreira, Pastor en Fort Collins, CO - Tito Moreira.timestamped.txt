[56:07] a coincidence
[56:09] Lord that we're here on

[56:35] place we're happy to be with you once
[56:40] again we're going to enter into our
[56:43] theme we want to talk to you a little
[56:45] bit about
[56:50] time about the one life that we have uh
[56:56] one person once
[57:01] said time is a strange
[57:06] commodity we can't save
[57:09] it re retrieve
[57:11] it relive
[57:13] it stretch it borrow
[57:17] it borrow
[57:20] it loan it stop it or
[57:28] stop it or store it but can only use it
[57:31] or lose
[57:32] it
[57:37] time it's the most valuable uh currency
[57:40] in which we
[57:42] have if time was
[57:46] money we would be able to
[57:48] say every single
[57:51] day God gives
[57:53] us
[57:57] let's just say 1,400 minutes a
[58:02] day we either use them or lose
[58:06] them it it would be like if someone said
[58:08] to
[58:09] [Applause]
[58:10] us I'm going to give you $1,400 a
[58:14] day but you have to use them well and if
[58:18] not you're going to lose
[58:19] them I believe if that was the
[58:23] case believe we would make
[58:28] sure that we would use that money
[58:31] correctly we would take
[58:34] advantage because if not we'd lose
[58:38] it now time has a funny
[58:42] way of passing through our
[58:47] lives I have a couple things I'd like to
[58:50] share with you
[58:52] now a couple pictures of videos that I
[58:54] sent sent them back
[58:57] there they're they're my own personal
[58:59] pictures and
[59:02] videos but I believe it it shows us
[59:05] all if you can please the first video
[59:10] please it shows us how quickly or fast
[59:13] time goes
[59:15] by I don't know if they have uh uh
[59:19] sound now this is my little boy
[59:23] Alden yeah I still remember when he was
[59:24] a
[59:29] [Music]
[59:36] baby
[59:39] [Music]
[59:45] seea it was barely a month old
[59:48] there I still
[59:51] remember when he was
[59:53] born
[59:57] he was born with a cone
[59:59] shaped he looked like an
[1:00:04] alien and in one
[1:00:08] occasion I
[1:00:13] recognized time goes by so
[1:00:16] quick it just looks like you just close
[1:00:19] your eyes
[1:00:21] blink if you can put the next picture
[1:00:24] and and then if they can put up the next
[1:00:26] one no not that one the other one that
[1:00:28] one there you
[1:00:30] go it just looks like I just barely
[1:00:34] blinked and this was his first day at
[1:00:37] preschool first day at school that we're
[1:00:40] going to leave
[1:00:42] him and I don't know how many parents
[1:00:44] remember that first
[1:00:47] day seems like it's recorded in our
[1:00:51] minds and then you blink once again
[1:00:56] and you can show the picture of how he
[1:00:58] is now he's about to be 12 years
[1:01:01] old and this is my
[1:01:03] son thank you very
[1:01:06] much and our lives have a
[1:01:11] way it seem like time escapes us so
[1:01:16] [Applause]
[1:01:19] easily and I believe this is what the
[1:01:21] Apostle Paul is trying to say to the
[1:01:23] church
[1:01:26] when he's saying redeeming
[1:01:29] time him saying take advantage Well of
[1:01:36] Time a writer once
[1:01:40] said a a
[1:01:42] poet a missionary
[1:01:45] Roberto called Roberto
[1:01:50] muat we will have all eternity
[1:01:56] to celebrate our
[1:02:00] victories but only one short
[1:02:04] hour before the
[1:02:06] sunset in which to win them I'm going to
[1:02:10] say it
[1:02:13] again we'll have an
[1:02:16] eternity to celebrate our
[1:02:20] victories how many are waiting for that
[1:02:23] day
[1:02:26] for the day in which we're able to
[1:02:27] celebrate our
[1:02:29] victories the day where we able to see
[1:02:31] each other in
[1:02:33] eternity and we
[1:02:36] Embrace and we start to
[1:02:40] testify what God did in our
[1:02:43] lives we have an whole
[1:02:46] eternity to celebrate
[1:02:50] victories but it seems like we just have
[1:02:52] a couple of hours
[1:02:56] to win some
[1:02:58] victories if we don't have victories in
[1:03:00] this
[1:03:01] life what are we going to celebrate come
[1:03:05] on
[1:03:06] church if we don't have
[1:03:11] victories what are we going to celebrate
[1:03:13] when we're there in
[1:03:14] eternity what will we say to
[1:03:17] David what will we say to
[1:03:19] Paul what will we say to
[1:03:23] Daniel what are we going to
[1:03:28] celebrate where we feel like we haven't
[1:03:30] gained
[1:03:33] victories we're going to have an
[1:03:35] eternity to celebrate
[1:03:38] them we simply have a couple of hours
[1:03:42] Brothers to gain or win those
[1:03:46] victories as I start to think a little
[1:03:48] bit in my
[1:03:50] life I want to share a little bit more
[1:03:52] of my life with you
[1:03:54] I still
[1:03:56] remember when I was 8 years
[1:03:59] old and an evangelist
[1:04:02] came in the church in which we were
[1:04:06] visiting we said who would want to
[1:04:09] accept the Lord Jesus
[1:04:11] Christ and I still remember that
[1:04:15] moment because I
[1:04:17] believe when you accept the Lord Jesus
[1:04:19] Christ to your
[1:04:21] life and you remember that moment
[1:04:25] there's something that stays recorded in
[1:04:27] your
[1:04:29] heart and I can remember saying it to
[1:04:31] God in that moment I was eight years
[1:04:34] old and I remember saying
[1:04:37] God I want you in my
[1:04:42] life I want you to be my
[1:04:46] savior I want to surrender my life to
[1:04:50] you and I
[1:04:53] remember then I started to learn the
[1:04:56] guitar started to sing more in
[1:04:59] church started to do more for
[1:05:03] God and I still remember the day I
[1:05:05] baptized
[1:05:09] myself and I I remember being the
[1:05:11] director of
[1:05:13] worship music
[1:05:15] sorry I would play the
[1:05:18] instruments and then I remember
[1:05:20] worshiping in
[1:05:22] church I still remember my first
[1:05:25] preaching I was 16 years
[1:05:30] old I preached a message
[1:05:32] called The Almost
[1:05:36] Christian that was my first ever
[1:05:39] preaching the almost
[1:05:43] Christian and I preached about how
[1:05:45] many we almost
[1:05:49] Christians and we're almost about to
[1:05:52] make
[1:05:53] it and we're almost almost supposed to
[1:05:56] be what we're supposed to
[1:05:58] be we talk about the 10 virgin about the
[1:06:00] foolish
[1:06:02] virgins I remember all of
[1:06:05] that and when I go back into my
[1:06:10] memory I'm proud of what I did for
[1:06:14] God I'm proud that I gave my life to the
[1:06:19] Lord I'm proud that I did what I could
[1:06:22] for him
[1:06:25] but there's something within me now that
[1:06:28] says what about these
[1:06:31] years what about these moments what
[1:06:34] about this
[1:06:37] day when I'm
[1:06:40] older and I look back to these
[1:06:43] years look back to these
[1:06:46] days what will I say of these
[1:06:49] moments what will I say of these
[1:06:52] days did I take it advantage of my
[1:06:56] time did I do everything for the kingdom
[1:06:59] of
[1:07:00] God I ask you the
[1:07:02] question church I ask you the
[1:07:07] question what will you say of these
[1:07:12] moments maybe you're very proud of what
[1:07:15] happened in the
[1:07:16] past or maybe you're not proud of your
[1:07:21] past but what we have is the now
[1:07:26] what we have is this
[1:07:28] moment many times Our
[1:07:33] Lives it's not composed of great
[1:07:35] emotional moments no
[1:07:40] sir we think that life is composed of
[1:07:43] Great

[1:07:53] first first
[1:07:57] car oh finally the person I wanted to
[1:08:00] talk to is talking back to
[1:08:06] me and we think that life is composed of
[1:08:08] those
[1:08:12] moments God but life is not composed of
[1:08:14] those Great
[1:08:17] Moments not only those moments but
[1:08:19] composed of small
[1:08:21] moments that we make great
[1:08:24] small
[1:08:26] moments days like
[1:08:28] this days like
[1:08:31] today that we

[1:08:50] great if we take advantage of time well
[1:08:54] that's right amen

[1:09:00] God how to take advantage of
[1:09:04] time he knows how to take advantage of
[1:09:07] difficult

[1:09:12] days the saddest of
[1:09:16] days in the future become the most

[1:09:42] pain he
[1:09:45] realizes in the most painful
[1:09:49] days be our greatest
[1:09:52] victories
[1:09:54] of those greatest
[1:09:56] victories will come
[1:09:59] out of the most difficult days that
[1:10:01] we've
[1:10:04] had we're going to be able to
[1:10:07] say all the devil gave it
[1:10:11] his but I didn't stay
[1:10:14] there I didn't stay on the
[1:10:17] ground but I rose up again yes sir
[1:10:22] amen
[1:10:29] what counts is not how much time or life
[1:10:32] we
[1:10:33] live but how we live
[1:10:38] it how we live
[1:10:41] it brother brandham
[1:10:45] says a greater than Solomon is
[1:10:50] here he says and I think the same thing
[1:10:52] tonight
[1:10:55] he's he's talking about the Queen of
[1:10:58] Sheba and how she gave it
[1:11:03] all when she realized what Solomon had
[1:11:05] was the truth she gave it
[1:11:08] all and he says I think the same thing
[1:11:12] tonight if this Plan of
[1:11:17] Salvation that we're contending for is
[1:11:22] right other words if this is a
[1:11:28] truth he says we owe everything that we
[1:11:32] got our
[1:11:34] life our
[1:11:36] time our everything
[1:11:38] [Music]
[1:11:40] else if it's not
[1:11:43] right then find out what is
[1:11:48] right cuz you only got this one
[1:11:51] life and it will soon won be
[1:11:54] over let me tell you
[1:11:58] church I have
[1:12:01] found what everything means to my
[1:12:04] life this
[1:12:07] message is the best that I have
[1:12:10] found this
[1:12:12] message is everything to
[1:12:15] me and if it's right if it's the
[1:12:20] truth if Jesus Christ is real
[1:12:26] that he deserves that I give the best of
[1:12:30] me he doesn't deserve half of
[1:12:33] me he deserves all of
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:43] me Paul trained a young
[1:12:46] man a young man called
[1:12:50] Timothy he taught him how to take
[1:12:52] advantage of time
[1:12:55] he taught him when he was a young
[1:12:59] man he taught him how to Quicken to re
[1:13:02] to rekindle that fire that was in his
[1:13:04] heart in second
[1:13:06] Timothy first chapter
[1:13:09] one
[1:13:16] verse when I call to remembrance the UN
[1:13:20] unfeigned faith that is in thee
[1:13:25] which dwelleth first in thy grandmother
[1:13:29] Lois and thy mother
[1:13:33] un and I am persuaded that in thee
[1:13:38] also wherefore I put
[1:13:42] Thee I believe that's what God is trying
[1:13:44] to tell us
[1:13:45] tonight wherefore I put
[1:13:51] thee in remembrance that thou ser up the
[1:13:54] gift of God which is in
[1:13:57] thee now now look what Paul is trying to
[1:14:00] tell
[1:14:03] Timothy he wants that
[1:14:06] Timothy Timothy stir up the gift that
[1:14:08] God
[1:14:10] gave Brothers I want to tell you God has
[1:14:12] given us all
[1:14:14] gifts we can all do something for God
[1:14:18] Amen we all have a gift of
[1:14:21] God you say brother I have
[1:14:25] well you got hands
[1:14:26] right you can appla to the Lord you can
[1:14:30] raise them
[1:14:31] up you have a mou to
[1:14:35] sing you have a mouth to say God I love
[1:14:38] you sometimes we come to
[1:14:41] church and it seems like we have nothing
[1:14:43] to offer
[1:14:45] God we have so much so him
[1:14:51] Hallelujah we have a voice
[1:14:54] oh you say I don't know how I
[1:14:56] sing that doesn't
[1:15:00] matter he looks at the worship that
[1:15:02] comes from your
[1:15:03] [Applause]
[1:15:07] heart now Paul is saying to Timothy stir
[1:15:09] up the gift within your
[1:15:14] hearts then the first thing he
[1:15:16] says before telling him
[1:15:22] that
[1:15:24] uh when I call to remembrance of
[1:15:25] unfeigned faith that is in
[1:15:30] thee which dwelleth first in your
[1:15:32] grandmother
[1:15:33] Lois and thy mother
[1:15:37] Unice and I am persuaded that in thee
[1:15:42] also Paul is saying to
[1:15:46] Timothy he's saying
[1:15:48] Timothy look from where you come
[1:15:51] from look from where you come
[1:15:54] from look who are your parents are look
[1:15:58] at your mother who your mother look who
[1:16:00] your grandmother
[1:16:03] is I believe that have several of the
[1:16:05] youth here could
[1:16:08] say my mother my
[1:16:10] father are sons of
[1:16:13] God my father is not a
[1:16:16] coward my mother's not a
[1:16:20] coward come
[1:16:22] on is there youth that's here that can
[1:16:25] testify my parents are not a bunch of
[1:16:29] cowards my Paul is a of
[1:16:32] Timothy look who your family
[1:16:34] is look from where you come
[1:16:38] from now I come from a Christian
[1:16:42] father I I come from a father that
[1:16:44] taught me from a young age that taught
[1:16:46] me to love
[1:16:47] God I
[1:16:51] remember when my dad would take me to
[1:16:52] the Park to the
[1:16:54] plazas he would give me a
[1:16:58] guitar and in front of everyone that was
[1:17:00] in that
[1:17:02] Park we would start to
[1:17:04] sing and he would start to
[1:17:07] preach and I was
[1:17:10] embarrassed my friends from school would
[1:17:12] look at
[1:17:15] me and they would say oh look at these
[1:17:17] odd balls
[1:17:19] I but one thing that my father taught
[1:17:22] me up
[1:17:25] fear to speak of what God has given
[1:17:28] you and testify of him yes sir
[1:17:34] amen but I ask you the
[1:17:36] question where do you come
[1:17:39] from oh you say I didn't have a father
[1:17:42] that taught me I didn't have a mother
[1:17:44] that taught
[1:17:46] me but
[1:17:49] spiritually what types of parents have
[1:17:52] we
[1:17:53] what type of spiritual father have we
[1:17:55] had come on
[1:17:56] Church how many can say
[1:17:59] here God gave me a spiritual
[1:18:02] father God gave me a spiritual
[1:18:05] father that Tau me
[1:18:08] correctly from where from where do we
[1:18:10] come from
[1:18:12] church that's what Paul's trying to say
[1:18:14] to
