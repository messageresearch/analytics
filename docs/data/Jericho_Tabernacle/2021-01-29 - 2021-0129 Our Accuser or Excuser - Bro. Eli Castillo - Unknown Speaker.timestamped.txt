[31:52] is called our accuser or
[31:55] excuse
[31:58] excusa
[32:12] the bible says
[32:15] for when the gentiles which have not the
[32:18] law
[32:19] do by nature the things contained in the
[32:22] law
[32:23] these having not the law are a law
[32:26] unto themselves
[32:37] which show the work of the law written
[32:40] in their hearts
[32:42] their conscience also bearing witness
[32:45] and their thoughts
[32:46] the meanwhile accusing or else excusing
[32:50] one another

[33:12] evening
[33:15] we thank you lord the name of jesus
[33:18] christ we pray
[33:21] amen amen you may be seated
[33:26] um in on fridays los biernes
[33:31] it's a youth service is it dedicated to
[33:33] the youth yes
[33:36] of course you know those of all ages we
[33:39] can
[33:41] rejoice in it and listen to the word
[33:48] this word of god is for all ages
[33:59] elderly can receive something from it
[34:04] and i thought of of the young people
[34:07] today
[34:10] you know i didn't want to bring
[34:11] something too much
[34:16] just something that we can receive and
[34:19] we can take
[34:20] to our daily lives
[34:26] you know the the young people brother
[34:29] branham says that young people
[34:31] uh this is
[34:36] he was talking to the young people in a
[34:40] message called
[34:41] come follow me
[34:46] and these young people they were
[34:48] graduating
[34:51] and he told them he said you
[34:54] are in a changing spot in your lives
[35:00] you make yourself when you're young
[35:04] you set your ambitions to do what you
[35:06] want to do
[35:10] as you think of course your mind it's
[35:12] presented into your mind by an
[35:42] they're in a changing spot whatever they
[35:46] do in their life
[35:48] whatever you think now okay it could
[35:52] drive you to
[35:53] do something great later on
[36:02] it says remember now thy creator in the
[36:05] days of thy youth
[36:10] remember him now
[36:13] remember when when you're 20 years
[36:16] and younger uh
[36:20] when when you're still a young branch
[36:37] while the evil days come not ants
[36:41] nor the years draw nigh
[36:46] when thou shalt say i have no pleasure
[36:49] in them
[36:53] brother branham says that you know 86
[36:55] percent
[36:56] uh of conversions
[37:01] is done before you're 20 years old
[37:26] the young green branch it it's not
[37:29] able to mold itself anymore
[37:47] that's why you remember the creator
[37:50] in the days of your youth
[37:56] when brother branham went to to the
[38:00] the uh sixth dimension when
[38:07] and he saw all these young men and women
[38:12] brother branham said that they were
[38:14] around 18 to 20 years old this is
[38:30] that's your greatest years
[38:34] whenever you're you're young maybe
[38:35] you're 10 9 or
[38:37] or maybe you're 12 and up
[38:43] you have time to grow with
[39:24] but that word will never depart from
[39:26] your
[39:29] amen i just wanted to say that before we
[39:31] get into the message
[39:36] now um speaking on the conscience
[39:53] as the conscience that dwells with
[40:09] and something in their heart begin to
[40:12] hurt
[40:15] they they begin to fail feel something
[40:18] that they never felt before
[40:35] god already instilled something inside
[40:38] of them
[40:41] so that whenever they sinned
[40:45] a guilt came over them
[40:48] and and they ran and hid themselves with
[40:51] fig leaves
[40:54] their eyes were were covered before
[40:58] they couldn't see their nakedness
[41:02] but whenever their eyes were opened
[41:18] every person is born with a conscience
[41:22] every single person is given this gift
[41:26] because of the fall a causa de la queira
[41:29] we have a fall in nature
[41:32] we lie
[41:46] something
[42:00] you know brother uh billy graham once
[42:02] said uh
[42:04] billy graham he said our conscience
[42:07] is one of the greatest proofs
[42:11] that there is a god okay exists because
[42:15] the the scripture that we just read
[42:18] it showed that the gentiles
[42:22] not having the law only the jews had the
[42:26] law
[42:28] it was only the hebrew children that
[42:30] received the ten commandments
[42:35] but gentiles that have never knew the
[42:38] word of the lord
[42:42] the bible said the law was written in
[42:45] their hearts
[42:49] by their conscience
[42:52] they knew right from wrong
[42:57] without even reading the old testament
[43:02] without even reading the bible
[43:06] once somebody cheated or lied yeah
[43:10] is
[43:24] so that showed that god is
[43:27] in existence
[43:32] amen amen you know a man is a seed
[43:35] brother branham says
[44:03] and he has faculties and one of them is
[44:06] your conscience
[44:12] brother branham says that god usually
[44:15] uses those avenues
[44:20] to want the comforter
[44:27] he'll use your conscience so that you
[44:29] can get closer to the lord
[44:34] but
[44:45] see brother branham says this your
[44:48] conscience will shun you from hell
[44:51] um it would show you from hell
[44:57] would try to make you live a good uh
[45:01] try to make you live good and right
[45:07] a good citizen will do that
[45:10] not necessarily be a christian
[45:12] necessarily
[45:14] i've seen many men who've denied the
[45:18] name of the lord jesus
[45:21] jesus they were fine people
[45:25] that means humanely significant
[45:28] so so your conscience will make you live
[45:30] a good life
[45:34] but but it will not take you to heaven
[45:38] you cannot live a good life
[45:42] and go to heaven you cannot try to live
[45:45] a good life because you have a good
[45:47] conscience
[45:51] your conscience is not a perfect guy
[45:55] if i could describe what our conscience
[45:58] is
[46:08] and it depends it depends on who you let
[46:11] speak and can
[46:24] if you indulge yourself in the things of
[46:27] the lord
[46:30] your heart will be more tender to god's
[46:32] voice
[46:36] but it's how you educate this conscience
[46:40] is whenever
[46:43] whenever you you indulge yourself in the
[46:46] things of the lord
[46:49] then this conscience that listens to the
[46:52] word of the lord
[46:58] [Music]
[47:08] then you don't go there and doesn't know
[47:09] what camino but you'll go somewhere else
[47:13] why because you're listening to the word
[47:16] of the lord
[47:21] but it has to be in
[47:49] that any man or woman that ever meets
[47:52] god face to face
[47:57] and can walk away and take you to light
[47:59] things
[48:02] to see people on the streets
[48:16] because their conscience doesn't like
[48:19] those things
[48:22] brother branham says the more i fast
[48:26] the more i pray andre the more i'm in
[48:30] his presence
[48:32] the more uglier the world gets mass
[48:35] fails
[48:36] and it begins to kill you to where you
[48:40] don't want to be
[48:41] around any of that stuff
[48:45] a godly conscience hurts
[48:50] but it's one of the biggest blessings
[48:52] that we have
[48:54] medicines it's like a faithful friend
[48:58] proverbs 26 as 27 6 says
[49:04] faithful are the wounds of a friend
[49:11] it hurts you know when you do something
[49:15] wrong
[49:17] when you think something wrong but when
[49:20] you have a guilt inside you
[49:23] lost nobody likes that feeling
[49:28] but it's a faithful friend it's
[49:31] telling you something it's telling you
[49:35] that there's danger
[49:38] it's telling you that there's something
[49:41] wrong and you need to fix it
[49:51] it's important to the human being it's
[49:53] important
[49:55] it's important it's important because
[49:59] it tells you to get away from something
[50:04] you know when you have the pain
[50:08] and you go and you touch a hot oven
[50:14] pain begins to to shout out in your body
[50:19] and it goes to your brain and says
[50:21] something is wrong here
[50:24] it says do not touch that again
[50:28] pain is so that it could preserve your
[50:31] body
[50:33] so that you could stay away from the
[50:35] danger
[50:38] and that's what our conscience does yes
[50:42] it keeps you away from danger alejado
[50:45] del peligro
[50:46] it keeps you away from things that can
[50:48] kill you and destroy you
[50:53] amen amen there was one time
[50:59] where king herod
[51:02] rey erodes you know king herod was
[51:06] the king in the time of john the baptist
[51:09] and jesus
[51:13] jesus and because of his sin he was
[51:15] caught up in
[51:16] a castle
[51:20] he was made to kill john the baptist
[51:25] now john the baptist he respected the
[51:28] position of john the baptist
[51:34] he was afraid of him but because of the
[51:38] sin that he indulged in
[51:42] it caused him to to behead john the
[51:45] baptist
[51:48] then jesus comes on the scene
[51:52] and when jesus is on the scene
[51:56] and in and herod begins to hear the
[51:59] reports
[52:00] of jesus
[52:05] jesus the bible says that he begin to be
[52:08] terrified he began to fear
[52:10] this
[52:13] because he said john the baptist has
[52:16] come
[52:16] from the dead
[52:20] what was it his conscience
[52:23] speaking to him knowing that he killed a
[52:27] righteous man
[52:30] that's what our conscience does
[52:34] amen amen but the bible says
[52:39] beloved uh and first john
[52:42] 3 21 it says premade
[52:59] that's beautiful to have a clear
[53:02] conscience
[53:04] to to have a good conscience you know
[53:08] a bad day with a good conscience
[53:23] and you can have one of the best days of
[53:25] your life
[54:02] he began to he they asked a man once
[54:08] what is a conscience what's your
[54:10] conscience
[54:12] and this man begin to explain explain
[54:15] what he thought
[54:16] your conscience was yes
[54:21] and brother branham uh quotes him
[54:25] he said it's a little thing that's got
[54:29] four points on it
[54:32] and they're sharp and it sits
[54:36] right in your heart
[54:39] and when they do something wrong
[54:43] it starts turning you let it keep
[54:47] turning
[54:48] us in
[55:19] there's two people
[55:22] in this world that can sleep good at
[55:26] night
[55:29] a man with a clear conscience
[55:33] and a person without a conscience at all
[55:37] brother branham says it's a little thing
[55:39] that's got four points on it
[55:44] and you allow that to continue to
[56:13] the very thing that will point us to
[56:15] christ
[56:19] can become defiled
[56:22] can become desensitized
[56:25] insensibly and can become evil
[56:30] in titus 1 15 and 16 it says
[56:36] unto all pure and to the pure
[56:40] all things are pure today
[56:44] but unto them that are defiled and
[56:46] unbelieving
[56:48] there is nothing pure mas para los
[56:51] cormpidos incredulos nada le espuro
[56:54] but even their mind and conscience
[57:01] they profess that they know god but in
[57:03] their works they deny them
[57:08] being abominable and disobedient and
[57:11] unto
[57:12] every good word reprobate
[57:20] man that hits hard
[57:23] to them that are
[57:27] defiled and unbelieving a chaos
[57:30] incredulous those that have a mind and
[57:33] conscience that are defiled
[57:37] there is nothing pure
[57:41] their mind is always on on evil things
[57:47] you know the most sacred things that are
[57:50] the
[57:50] sacred most sacred thing on this world
[57:53] in this world
[57:57] it is the word of god
[58:01] but but to and somebody that's defiled
[58:06] and unbelievable and their conscience is
[58:10] defiled
[58:13] it says nothing is pure this is puro
[58:17] first timothy four one two
[58:21] 1-2 says now the spirit
[58:25] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[58:29] times
[58:29] some shall depart from the faith giving
[58:32] heed to seducing spirits
[58:34] and doctrine of devils speaking lies in
[58:37] hypocrisy
[58:38] having their conscience seared within
[58:41] hot iron
[58:45] spirit
[59:03] conscience it comes from
[59:06] an exposure or too much of an exposure
[59:10] to sin
[59:14] you've exposed yourself to sin
[59:55] until it becomes seared without hot iron
[1:00:13] why because we stopped listening to the
[1:00:17] still small voice
[1:00:23] your conscience is important
[1:00:39] telling you to serve the lord with all
[1:00:41] your heart
[1:00:44] but if we continue to deny that calling
[1:00:50] come follow me benny seeking man come
[1:00:52] follow me
[1:00:53] benny seegan man there'll be one time we
[1:00:56] don't hear it anymore
[1:00:59] and frankly we won't care anymore
[1:01:05] it doesn't matter because it doesn't
[1:01:08] hurt inside
[1:01:10] anymore we have no more
[1:01:13] feelings brother branham says
[1:01:17] uh branham and uh from that time
[1:01:21] you pass by the church
[1:01:25] and you hear the people singing the
[1:01:26] gospel songs you said
[1:01:31] you really want to go in you said but
[1:01:34] oh my you light up another cigarette and
[1:01:37] shake your head
[1:01:43] what are you trying to do you're
[1:01:46] fighting
[1:01:47] your way through every barricade just
[1:02:04] run every
[1:02:56] you'll walk away and shun god to keep
[1:02:59] receiving the holy ghost
[1:03:27] and some of your friends outside
[1:03:29] lafayette
[1:03:32] you say if that's the new birth i don't
[1:03:35] want nothing to do with it
[1:03:41] a person will break every barrier
[1:03:46] run through every warning sign
[1:03:51] until those barricades obstacles
[1:03:54] and those warning signs yeah
[1:04:08] the bible talks about an evil conscience
[1:04:14] we can run over the spirit of the lord
[1:04:16] so many times
[1:04:21] that those barricades and those warning
[1:04:23] signs
[1:04:24] is
[1:05:34] preachings
[1:05:39] you've got to break through the holy
[1:05:40] spirit
[1:05:45] and fight your way into that white gate
[1:05:49] in broadway
[1:05:50] i say
[1:05:53] brother branham says this is in
[1:05:56] fellowship
[1:05:58] but when men and women let their hearts
[1:06:01] become
[1:06:01] seer
[1:06:15] because it's a beautiful thing god given
[1:06:18] us
[1:06:20] he's given us something to point us to
[1:06:23] christ
[1:06:27] he says they become seared
[1:06:53] it looks like a bunch of prehistoric
[1:06:55] animals
[1:06:58] historically
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:06] the bible said they have their
[1:07:08] conscience seared with a
[1:07:09] hot iron
[1:07:20] he's not talking of the one that doesn't
[1:07:22] care el no hablas
[1:07:25] he's talking about church members
[1:07:29] we go to church but then we do what we
[1:07:32] want to do
[1:07:35] that's that's not christianity
[1:07:38] christianism
[1:07:39] christianity is not what church you go
[1:07:42] to
[1:07:42] christianism christianity
[1:07:46] is is not doing a bunch of rules
[1:07:53] it's a relationship with the lord jesus
[1:07:56] christ
[1:07:59] it's being a friend of jesus christ
[1:08:04] that's true christianity is
[1:08:07] christianized throw all that other
[1:08:08] garbage away
[1:08:10] because you don't need it all them
[1:08:14] religious
[1:08:14] acts and all those things they're no
[1:08:17] good if you don't have jesus christ
[1:08:24] we have to have jesus christ it's
[1:08:26] necessary
[1:08:28] as a friend come on amigo then
[1:08:31] then you don't want to hurt your friends
[1:08:50] in revelations 3 we know these
[1:08:52] scriptures
[1:08:59] jesus is talking to the lady osea church
[1:09:01] age jesus
[1:09:18] and he said i will spew you out of my
[1:09:20] mouth
[1:09:24] because you say i'm
[1:09:27] rich and increased with goods
[1:09:32] i don't have
[1:09:47] i saw that and i saw the negative
[1:09:52] of the garden of eden
[1:09:57] god covered adam and eve's eyes
[1:10:28] and they saw
[1:10:43] del pueblo and they don't know that
[1:10:44] they're they're naked
[1:10:46] miserable
[1:10:52] it takes the holy spirit
[1:10:56] it takes the holy spirit
[1:10:59] to take away all that blindness
[1:11:04] so that they can realize that they're
[1:11:06] naked
[1:11:09] and their conscience and their their
[1:11:11] guilt will flood over them
[1:11:15] and their real lives that they're wrong
[1:11:20] amen amen now there's this story
[1:11:25] of this woman that brother branham
[1:11:26] talked about
[1:11:30] i don't believe that he mentioned her
[1:11:33] name
[1:11:36] but he talked and i'm gonna give you a
[1:11:38] short version of it
[1:11:42] he talked about her as a church member
[1:11:48] she was going to the methodist church
[1:11:52] and she got married with a a fine young
[1:11:56] man
[1:11:59] and brother brown said that that man was
[1:12:01] filled with the holy spirit
[1:12:05] but brother beram said that this little
[1:12:08] lady was just not
[1:12:09] right
[1:12:13] and there was one time where the the
[1:12:15] young men had to go
[1:12:17] um i had a state to start working
[1:12:20] inclusive mentioning
[1:12:25] and this little lady she was the pianist
[1:12:27] of the church
[1:12:31] and she started to see the other sisters
[1:12:35] differently
[1:12:39] she started to see them that they were
[1:12:41] smoking cigarettes
[1:12:44] that they would cut their hair that they
[1:12:47] would wear
[1:12:48] tight skirts and she said well if they
[1:12:52] could do it
[1:12:55] that's where she messed up where she
[1:12:58] began to reason
[1:13:01] she said if they could do
[1:13:08] so she began to to be just like the
[1:13:11] other women
[1:13:16] brother branham says listen to man of
[1:13:17] branham
[1:13:19] that uh he says that
[1:13:22] notice she began to wear little clothes
[1:13:28] her husband said dear i don't believe
[1:13:32] now she said look if lucy and ella
[1:13:36] and all of them can wear it why can i
[1:13:39] carry on
[1:13:44] success
[1:13:50] see right down here in her soul it said
[1:13:53] that's wrong
[1:14:11] and she began to act like all these
[1:14:13] women
[1:14:16] and as the the husband would go out and
[1:14:19] work
[1:14:21] brother branham said a little slicker
[1:14:24] began to live right next to them
[1:14:30] and they would go next to the fence and
[1:14:32] begin to talk to one another
[1:14:38] and every time her soul
[1:15:03] but she would reason and say well no um
[1:15:06] my husband's never here buenos
[1:15:20] and the one that was filled with the
[1:15:21] holy ghost
[1:15:33] the soul that sinneth that
[1:15:36] soul shall die
[1:15:41] death means separate significance
[1:15:45] she kept getting um getting away
[1:15:48] from it farther and farther and farther
[1:15:55] wow that that's amazing
[1:15:59] that she started her her soul begin to
[1:16:01] separate from her quest
[1:16:48] reasoning said but the rest of them um
[1:16:51] can do it why can't i
[1:16:53] but you know
[1:16:56] when she puts on those little ungodly
[1:17:00] clothes
[1:17:02] nature itself will tell her that's wrong
[1:17:04] but she said the rest of them do it why
[1:17:06] can't i
[1:17:07] die
[1:17:13] she got herself in a pitiful condition
[1:17:17] brother branham says that she got sick
[1:17:21] and she ended up in the hospital
[1:17:25] so but she didn't want brother branham
[1:17:28] to pray for her
[1:17:31] i don't want that little old holy roller
[1:17:34] to pray for me
[1:17:38] and brother neville used to be her
[1:17:40] pastor
[1:17:42] never anticipate
[1:17:55] to go over there and pray for her
[1:17:59] well she thought she was fine
[1:18:02] she shut off the little voice that told
[1:18:05] her she was wrong
[1:18:09] she felt justified
[1:18:13] but she wasn't but so when brother
[1:18:16] neville came
[1:18:16] does he go neville she thought he was
[1:18:19] going to give her a little
[1:18:21] nice pretty little prayer pen eva
[1:18:27] but he says you need to get right with
[1:18:29] the lord
[1:18:33] and she said what yeah
[1:18:36] get my life right with the lord
[1:18:50] she said i belong to this church and i
[1:18:53] did it and i do this and that
[1:18:55] yo she
[1:18:58] actually believed in reasoning
[1:19:03] she said i'm just as good as you are
[1:19:06] they
[1:19:10] all those cigarettes and all those
[1:19:12] things and all those
[1:19:14] things that she was doing
[1:19:18] she said i'm just as good as you are
[1:19:31] and brother branham says when all your
[1:19:34] intellects
[1:19:35] and your your reasoning begins to fade
[1:19:38] away
[1:19:43] your intellect begins to break up and uh
[1:19:46] it begins to break up this is
[1:19:48] intellectual
[1:20:02] and begin
[1:20:16] and so she turned to her pastor
[1:20:20] and she said you liar you snake in the
[1:20:23] grass
[1:20:25] well you told me i was okay
[1:20:29] you told me i was all right
[1:20:44] to steal that voice
[1:20:47] and while she was crying out i'm lost
[1:20:50] i'm lost
[1:20:53] he shot the needle in her arm
[1:20:58] they
[1:21:14] wow that's something
[1:21:18] that that's something to open our eyes
[1:21:23] that what i cannot play church the quiz
[1:21:39] and my soul in all my actions
[1:21:43] my conscience will come back to me
[1:21:48] and then and tell me all the things that
[1:21:51] i should have done
[1:22:20] he was a good child
[1:22:33] but still inside of him he was seeking
[1:22:36] for eternal life
[1:22:42] and he asked the lord jesus how do i
[1:22:45] receive eternal life
[1:22:49] jesus says come and follow me
[1:22:53] drop all those things that you're
[1:22:55] holding on to
[1:22:59] and follow me and it grieved that young
[1:23:03] man
[1:23:03] yes you
[1:23:16] so he rejected the voice of the lord
[1:23:41] why because they don't have some voice
[1:23:44] speaking to them
[1:24:01] he said i say to my soul
[1:24:04] me alma what what does that soul do when
[1:24:07] we reject it
[1:24:10] it separates he says i say to my soul
[1:24:14] that i'm satisfied
[1:24:42] he comes with gifts he comes with power
[1:24:46] el viene con poder he comes with a
[1:24:49] position
[1:24:52] when he calls you when he tells you to
[1:24:55] come follow him
[1:25:11] quesudon came back to him
[1:25:14] brother jesus was going to call him to
[1:25:16] be an evangelist brother branham said
[1:25:19] this
[1:25:23] and he began to act as
[1:25:40] he said just let somebody raise up
[1:25:43] and go preach to them
[1:25:48] but it was too late it was too late
[1:25:51] because he didn't
[1:26:06] important it doesn't matter how old you
[1:26:09] are
[1:26:11] it doesn't matter how set in your ways
[1:26:13] you are okay
[1:26:16] if you want the lord jesus
[1:26:20] jesus if you hear
[1:26:28] [Music]
[1:26:44] he wanted to he he was dreaming about
[1:26:47] how rich he could be
[1:26:52] and and he would go out and look for
[1:26:55] gold in mine for gold
[1:26:59] and he would think oh one day i'm going
[1:27:01] to be so rich
[1:27:02] yes brother branham said this story
[1:27:06] happened here in arizona
[1:27:10] arizona and one day he struck the goal
[1:27:16] and it was so much gold he he couldn't
[1:27:18] all take it at once
[1:27:23] and he was happy but but he had a
[1:27:26] faithful dog that he loved
[1:27:41] but whenever he got so excited because
[1:27:43] he had all this gold
[1:27:48] he got drunk that night
[1:27:52] he said i'm going to celebrate one more
[1:27:54] time before i go to the city
[1:27:58] before i buy this and i buy that ante
[1:28:02] before i show all my friends how rich i
[1:28:04] am
[1:28:08] but not knowing
[1:28:12] there was that whole time he was mining
[1:28:15] for gold
[1:28:18] there was someone there waiting in the
[1:28:21] bushes
[1:28:24] waiting for him to strike goals
[1:28:29] so that he could attack him and take all
[1:28:32] his goals
[1:28:35] he didn't know that so while he was
[1:28:38] getting
[1:28:39] drunk and happy and wasted
[1:28:52] began to cry out begin to bark
[1:29:07] and the drunk prospector said shut up
[1:29:10] i'm i'm trying to celebrate here
[1:29:15] i don't want to hear you no more but
[1:29:17] that faithful dog was
[1:29:19] crying out because there was danger
[1:29:22] nearby
[1:29:26] but he got to the point where he felt
[1:29:28] like he didn't need that dog anymore
[1:29:33] his worldly ambitions went farther than
[1:29:36] his faithful friend
[1:29:41] so he got the shotgun and he shot the
[1:29:43] dog
[1:29:47] and that night that man that was
[1:29:50] creeping in the darkness
[1:29:54] took him and killed him and took all his
[1:29:56] goals
[1:30:01] that's the holy spirit today
[1:30:17] make it right with the lord come to
[1:30:21] the fountain bengal come to jesus christ
[1:30:26] so that he can wipe away all your guilt
[1:30:31] he could take away all your sins
[1:30:59] [Music]
[1:31:28] my
[1:31:57] to the very point i i couldn't even
[1:31:59] think of anything wrong
[1:32:04] if i felt like i offended a brother
[1:32:08] my conscience would beam me up my
[1:32:10] conscience
[1:32:38] he'll regenerate
[1:33:05] he created you
[1:33:19] you're ashamed of something you've done
[1:33:24] tell your faithful friend and he'll take
[1:33:27] it all
[1:33:30] and put it in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:33:34] he won't think evil of you hey he will
[1:33:36] think bad of you
[1:33:40] it's impossible for him to remember the
[1:33:45] sin that he already covered
[1:33:53] amen amen amen let us stand to our feet
