[52:26] in the blood of our lord jesus christ
[52:31] gave us an example of the feeling of the
[52:33] holy ghost

[54:19] mother
[54:36] he would plant and he would harvest
[54:38] [Music]
[54:42] he'd go out and sell in the streets in a
[54:44] truck
[54:47] i'll tell you this because he the
[54:49] supreme court from his own voice
[55:20] i know plenty of his testimony because
[55:21] he shared with me with a lot of emotion
[55:27] how he had worked before he had gotten
[55:29] sick
[55:32] he was a
[55:35] [Music]
[55:47] a warrior full of love and comprehension
[55:50] dominion
[55:51] self-control
[55:55] and a lot of courage

[57:04] you don't know what's coming for us uh
[57:06] besides what we're already going through
[57:09] there are tests
[57:24] but with his holy spirit
[57:28] it's not with our strength
[57:32] but giving place
[57:35] or god to manifest himself
[57:45] because the word of god says
[57:50] in first corinthians chapter 13
[57:52] the
[58:05] it doesn't envy
[58:32] it doesn't rejoice in iniquity
[58:34] massage

[1:09:11] god bless you brothers
[1:09:47] uh hi good morning my name is ankel
[1:09:49] emmanuel pasuelos ortiz and i am
[1:09:52] uh
[1:09:53] josue luisa's grandson
[1:10:06] we never accustom ourselves to say uh
[1:10:09] grandpa grandma we always say like
[1:10:11] granny or gramps or
[1:10:22] and saying the words the full term
[1:10:23] grandmother or grandfather it's like it
[1:10:25] made them seem really old so we gave
[1:10:27] them those cute nicknames
[1:10:34] i'd like to say some words on the 10th
[1:10:36] of january 2022.
[1:10:39] and i wrote these words
[1:10:42] the day that my grandpa passed away
[1:10:47] two days ago my mother called
[1:10:50] me applications
[1:10:55] and we talked about the applications and
[1:10:57] seeing them after my homework
[1:11:02] the doctor came in and said that we had
[1:11:03] to leave quickly
[1:11:06] because we stayed for longer than 30
[1:11:08] minutes
[1:11:11] my grandpa didn't want anyone to go yes
[1:11:16] and that seemed very strange to granny
[1:11:17] and my mom
[1:11:23] dialysis
[1:11:26] even though going through so much pain
[1:11:27] through dialysis and medical procedures
[1:11:29] my grandfather never complained
[1:11:31] on this game
[1:11:33] before mom and grandma left
[1:11:38] he asked for one last domino game
[1:11:42] mom and grandma they laughed
[1:11:45] and then they got an agreement
[1:11:49] [Music]
[1:11:50] and then after a few minutes the call
[1:11:52] was over
[1:11:54] in person
[1:12:00] he told me that he really struggled in
[1:12:01] this last game
[1:12:05] the little pieces would fall out of his
[1:12:07] hands
[1:12:09] and his hands wouldn't stop shaking
[1:12:15] even took a few minutes just to put the
[1:12:17] domino pieces on the table
[1:12:35] my mom told me that in his last game he
[1:12:36] won
[1:12:39] he beat my mom and my grandma
[1:12:43] as they would pack their things
[1:12:47] victoria they could see him smile with
[1:12:49] his victory
[1:12:53] i could have only imagined the happiness
[1:12:55] in that moment
[1:13:02] i could only imagine how in a fraction
[1:13:04] of a second everything was normal
[1:13:09] it was all good and we had our dad once
[1:13:11] again
[1:13:14] why number seven
[1:13:16] your almighty
[1:13:31] and when i think of the month of july i
[1:13:33] think of these artificial games and
[1:13:34] celebrations
[1:13:38] but unfortunately i i feel like i made a
[1:13:40] mistake
[1:13:46] but what i'm sure of is that of the
[1:13:48] seven days of the week i want to spend
[1:13:50] them with you riendo
[1:13:52] laughing and crying
[1:13:55] just take him into the sun playing with
[1:13:57] chateau regano las plantas
[1:14:01] just watering the flowers and passing by
[1:14:02] the house
[1:14:04] [Music]
[1:14:06] or doing our favorite activity which was
[1:14:08] to eat
[1:14:14] in this corruptable world we have seven
[1:14:16] continents
[1:14:23] and with those seven continents i'm
[1:14:25] bothered because we're wasting time here
[1:14:30] so much of terrain to cover and explore
[1:14:34] i promise that i would take you
[1:14:38] to any place at any moment
[1:14:55] nothing will be apart from cancer
[1:14:58] and it still isn't
[1:15:00] for you
[1:15:01] for me
[1:15:03] but for us
[1:15:08] forgive me for not being able to take
[1:15:09] you to new places
[1:15:12] to eat in new places
[1:15:21] pleasing places exotic places and
[1:15:23] expensive places
[1:15:27] where i wish you could ask for more than
[1:15:29] seven plates
[1:15:33] i wished i could have appreciated
[1:15:35] everything that god has given us
[1:15:50] sight
[1:15:56] beauty that you can only see with the
[1:15:57] more time that you look at it
[1:16:11] the beauty that's captured by perception
[1:16:13] and is nourished by love
[1:16:18] like the love that you gave to me
[1:16:22] he believed in me
[1:16:25] he believed in me when all the problems
[1:16:27] were against me
[1:16:30] he believed in me when my back was
[1:16:32] against the wall
[1:16:33] el padre perfecto the perfect father
[1:16:41] hermano when i was a little boy he'd
[1:16:42] make me and my brother smile laugh
[1:16:44] no spurs
[1:16:49] you chase us with the vacuum and make us
[1:16:51] cry and then laugh and then cry again
[1:17:01] i wish that he could have kept working
[1:17:10] i wish you could have seen me work from
[1:17:12] seven in the morning until the next day
[1:17:18] maybe at 7pm we could make ourselves
[1:17:20] something to eat
[1:17:41] you deserve to rest because you're a
[1:17:42] spectacular
[1:17:57] in life the last thing i told you is all
[1:17:59] my achievements they're dedicated to you
[1:18:01] and i love you
[1:18:04] administrator
[1:18:06] everything is possible and i'll
[1:18:07] administer my time better i promise you
[1:18:36] god created the world in six days and on
[1:18:37] the seventh day he rested
[1:18:42] seven is destined to represent
[1:18:44] perfection and the fullness
[1:18:49] then through seven minutes your heart
[1:18:50] stays still
[1:19:04] and his heart stood still for seven
[1:19:06] minutes and i was there to translate
[1:19:07] what the seven medics were saying
[1:19:14] i wasn't there to count to seven or for
[1:19:16] my mother to be there to reach his
[1:19:17] seventh breath
[1:19:20] problem
[1:19:32] and i wish i could have picked my phone
[1:19:33] and grabbed the seven pieces of dominoes
[1:19:35] to play
[1:19:38] if i would have won maybe you would have
[1:19:39] been here
[1:19:45] maybe the impulse of wanting that
[1:19:46] rematch would have kept you awake to be
[1:19:48] here
[1:19:53] maybe we could play for seven hours more
[1:19:55] or for seven more games
[1:20:01] maybe i could have hit in your room for
[1:20:02] seven hours and everything would have
[1:20:04] been okay
[1:20:06] and they're in a domino game
[1:20:10] please give me my rematch
[1:20:15] and i say and i know that you never say
[1:20:16] no to that
[1:20:24] and in that matter you could teach me
[1:20:25] all your tricks and give to me all your
[1:20:26] wisdom and knowledge
[1:20:43] i never saw you angry or explode out of
[1:20:44] frustration
[1:20:48] you're always so loving and so kind
[1:20:53] always cracking jokes and smiling like a
[1:20:54] little kid
[1:20:59] and you're happy and you choose to be
[1:21:00] happy
[1:21:05] and you choose to keep calm in desperate
[1:21:06] situations
[1:21:09] and you choose to battle hate with love
[1:22:07] and he'd stand as like a wall in front
[1:22:08] of the bicycle even though i was going
[1:22:09] as fast as i could
[1:22:12] and he'd stop me like that as a child
[1:22:21] in my heart
[1:22:24] i also just want to say he's the best
[1:22:26] father i could have ever known
[1:22:32] and the number seven seven are angelical
[1:22:34] numbers
[1:22:39] my heart is so calm knowing that he's
[1:22:40] there
[1:22:42] amongst them
[1:22:46] and then leaving the hospital on the
[1:22:47] 10th of january

[1:23:32] and every day i'm thankful with god
[1:23:33] connell with him me my mom my mother
[1:23:37] and my mom
[1:23:42] because of them we are the people that
[1:23:43] we are
[1:23:52] and i never forget how proud he was of
[1:23:54] me and my brother
[1:23:56] he never failed in reminding us that
[1:23:59] he had
[1:24:04] every time we see him he'd always remind
[1:24:05] us keep going on in school keep going on
[1:24:07] with what you're doing
[1:24:12] and i get happy knowing that he's
[1:24:13] watching over us
[1:24:25] and i know that he's still watching i
[1:24:26] want him to keep watching because we've
[1:24:28] gotten plenty to make him proud still
[1:24:32] and i know i might be selfish in
[1:24:34] thinking
[1:24:37] and being sad that he's not here
[1:24:42] is
[1:24:44] and i'm being sad i'm sad and i'm
[1:24:46] selfish to know that he's not going to
[1:24:47] be here to see me and my brother
[1:24:48] graduate
[1:24:52] the csb engineers and lawyers as well
[1:25:10] [Music]
[1:25:12] to be at my side at the altar for my
[1:25:14] wedding
[1:25:18] won't be there when i buy my first house
[1:25:26] and i know i'm being selfish because the
[1:25:27] memories continue
[1:25:30] and i know that he's smiling in peace
[1:25:38] and finally after so much pain i know
[1:25:40] that he's resting
[1:25:46] i thank god because i feel in my heart
[1:25:48] that he's smiling
[1:26:00] [Music]
[1:26:04] i know that he's very happy
[1:26:20] i want to tell him he doesn't have
[1:26:21] anything to worry about
[1:26:28] after so many injections so much pain so
[1:26:30] much medical procedures
[1:26:34] it's his time
[1:26:46] thank you
[1:27:14] [Music]
[1:27:19] [Music]
[1:27:37] [Music]
[1:27:41] you know that we're here with our
[1:27:42] brother and his body here present
[1:27:57] we've always been together in the good
[1:27:59] times and the bad times
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:05] we fellowship for a long time even in
[1:28:07] the same house
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:42] i don't remember how many years but more
[1:28:43] than 15 years
[1:28:50] but knowing that our brother's in a
[1:28:52] better place
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:29:02] [Music]
[1:29:16] [Music]
[1:29:36] we fight not against flesh and blood but
[1:29:38] spirits that are in the air
[1:29:42] and my brother he battled plenty against
[1:29:45] him
[1:29:48] he battled when the battle was good
[1:29:53] [Music]
[1:30:04] it's
[1:30:18] because that's what his word says
[1:30:24] we know that those in christ they don't
[1:30:26] die they just sleep
[1:30:30] and he's up there with him right now el
[1:30:32] esta
[1:30:52] because the bible says there's many
[1:30:53] promises
[1:30:55] for all those that die in christ
[1:31:08] i'd like to read something that says
[1:31:10] what death is for the christians
[1:31:14] for
[1:31:28] second corinthians chapter five verse
[1:31:30] eight says this you see
[1:31:31] it says
[1:31:38] we are confident i say and willing
[1:31:40] rather to be absent from the body and to
[1:31:42] be present with the lord
[1:31:46] and it also says in the book of
[1:31:47] philippians 1 23.
[1:31:56] the moment that a christian dies his
[1:31:58] presence goes immediately unto christ
[1:32:02] and the apostle paul
[1:32:06] he spoke about his desire to die and go
[1:32:09] before christ
[1:32:19] there's many scriptures like mark 5 39
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:34] we went to go wake up a girl that they
[1:32:35] said was dead but she was not dead
[1:32:44] when you come in he sayeth unto them
[1:32:46] ties your eyes why make us this addo and
[1:32:49] weep
[1:32:51] damsel is not dead
[1:32:54] but sleepeth
[1:32:57] and they laughed him to scorn marcel
[1:33:00] but when he put them all out
[1:33:04] of the father and the mother of the
[1:33:05] damsel
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:32] and straight away the dams of the rose
[1:33:34] and walked out for she was 12 years of
[1:33:36] age and she was astonished with a great
[1:33:38] astonishment
[1:33:43] here's an example of that the christian
[1:33:44] doesn't die but he's just sleeping
[1:34:29] that he's given to us
[1:34:41] he was a man of much faith
[1:34:44] so
[1:35:12] he
[1:35:36] [Music]
[1:35:38] saliva will get his life will get better
[1:35:40] and better
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:44] sometimes we go every 15 days
[1:35:52] we like to go more frequently like two
[1:35:54] to three times
[1:36:01] but for that same reason i would tell my
[1:36:03] wife we need to be careful and also care
[1:36:05] for the brother
[1:36:08] lately we were traveling a lot to mexico
[1:36:16] we also had to be aware and take care of
[1:36:18] ourselves in order to take care of
[1:36:19] others
[1:36:22] i'd
[1:36:33] where him one morning
[1:36:51] and the brother he had the holy ghost
[1:36:55] he was loved by god
[1:37:10] and that form that dove is uh what i
[1:37:12] could say the signs
[1:37:15] that he sent him
[1:37:17] that he was the son of god
[1:37:32] drop its head to look at the brother's
[1:37:34] face
[1:37:37] it was something very beautiful that we
[1:37:39] saw
[1:37:42] and the brother he was something special
[1:37:49] and i thank god because he put him in
[1:37:50] our path
[1:37:53] he didn't put me in his path your person
[1:37:55] may come in god placed him in my heart
[1:38:00] could see
[1:38:18] when you go out into dialysis
[1:38:23] and my poor brother would just move his
[1:38:24] head
[1:38:26] it was a difficult trial that my brother
[1:38:28] had
[1:38:40] i'm already accustomed
[1:39:24] did
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:36] mr maria thank you for loving my brother
[1:39:39] my name mr daisy
[1:39:41] gracias thank you
[1:39:44] for taking care of him so much
[1:39:50] it's a great love that you have for him
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:27] [Music]
[1:40:35] the best hands are than being in the
[1:40:36] hands of our lord jesus christ
[1:40:40] that's the greatest thing
[1:40:43] get close
[1:40:45] to the lord jesus christ
[1:41:01] the same way
[1:41:30] and we want to see him again
[1:41:35] we've got to be walking with our lord
[1:41:36] jesus christ
[1:41:40] like the prophet said to be on the side
[1:41:42] of jesus
[1:41:44] jesus because if you're not on jesus's
[1:41:46] side
[1:41:48] then you're on the other side
[1:41:51] so there's two paths
[1:41:55] the way the path of the lord jesus
[1:41:56] christ
[1:41:58] the path of satan
[1:42:03] [Music]
[1:42:10] no one wants to perish without being in
[1:42:12] the presence of the lord jesus christ
[1:42:15] we've got to be conscious
[1:42:20] when we depart like our brother said a
[1:42:21] while ago
[1:42:24] to be sure on what side we're on
[1:42:52] we were in the worst
[1:43:06] [Music]
[1:43:22] now
[1:43:24] in the lord jesus christ
[1:43:34] left without words what our young man
[1:43:36] said in our brother
[1:44:04] no it's not easy brothers
[1:44:06] passing to go through something bitter
[1:44:08] like that's not easy
[1:44:13] to drink like bitter vinegar
[1:44:17] lord jesus christ when he was at the
[1:44:18] cross
[1:44:20] he desired some water
[1:44:23] but they gave him vinegar water
[1:44:27] he just turned his mouth to the side
[1:44:29] tomorrow can't drink that
[1:44:32] what is
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:44] we've got to do something so when he's
[1:44:46] over there lost
[1:44:59] that's the only way
[1:45:06] i'm ready
[1:45:12] for you my brethren to also be ready
[1:45:27] because if we were ready
[1:45:56] he places the example
[1:45:59] of a life
[1:46:00] following the way he did
[1:46:04] i'll be closing with this brothers
[1:46:08] family
[1:46:10] right
[1:46:24] in
[1:46:28] [Music]
[1:46:51] like angel said
[1:47:04] that's what broke my heart the most is
[1:47:22] just like us on earth
[1:47:29] we've got to give to our heavenly father
[1:47:49] [Music]
[1:47:51] i bless you
[1:48:18] i love this
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:47] goodbyes
[1:48:48] [Music]
[1:48:52] will there be spoken
[1:48:58] entire
[1:49:01] [Music]
[1:49:05] anymore
[1:49:07] [Music]
[1:49:26] someday
[1:49:30] [Music]
[1:49:37] they're my hopes
[1:49:43] shall be
[1:49:48] [Music]
[1:50:02] i'm
[1:50:03] looking out
[1:50:08] across
[1:50:10] the river
[1:50:16] [Music]
[1:50:27] there's just
[1:50:29] [Music]
[1:50:40] then i will
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:51:18] my
[1:51:22] shall be
[1:51:28] [Music]
[1:51:46] you may be seated just for a few moments
[1:51:52] we're going to try and just
[1:51:54] shorten the time
[1:52:00] and
[1:52:02] we're going to open our bibles to the
[1:52:04] book of luke 10 27.
[1:52:09] the word of god says
[1:52:14] answering he said
[1:52:20] thou shalt love the lord god with all
[1:52:22] thy heart and all thy soul
[1:52:26] is
[1:52:31] and with all thy strength and with all
[1:52:32] thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself
[1:52:38] and said unto him that was answered
[1:52:40] right
[1:52:55] who is my neighbor entonces
[1:53:03] the word says he tried to justify
[1:53:04] himself
[1:53:06] and god gave him a parable
[1:53:10] there was a man quebec
[1:53:12] that was walking on his way
[1:53:16] and he was assaulted
[1:53:18] he was wounded
[1:53:22] almost to the point of killing him
[1:53:38] then
[1:54:05] give him what he needs and when i return
[1:54:07] i'll pay you
[1:54:09] entonces
[1:54:17] he said the lord says of these three who
[1:54:19] was the one who was the one that loved
[1:54:21] this man that was wounded
[1:54:26] answered is the man that had mercy upon
[1:54:28] him
[1:54:31] he said do that and you shall live and
[1:54:33] says
[1:54:49] god desires that we love him with all of
[1:54:51] our hearts
[1:54:54] with all of our soul and all of our
[1:54:55] strengths
[1:54:59] but many times we justify ourselves
[1:55:29] we think about it
[1:55:32] and he knows it
[1:55:34] he knows what we're going to do
[1:55:40] so the purpose is that we love him with
[1:55:41] all of our heart
[1:56:12] because he doesn't
[1:56:26] he embraced this message
[1:57:07] we believe by faith that he was an
[1:57:10] overcomer
[1:57:13] and applying the word of god to his life
[1:57:16] he overcame
[1:57:18] his finales he reached his last days
[1:57:22] benciendo
[1:57:50] to say goodbye to the remains of our
[1:57:52] brother
[1:57:54] [Music]
[1:57:56] and those that remain still here else
[1:58:01] the lord continues to remind
[1:58:03] there's still time
[1:58:15] in the book of isaiah chapter one verse
[1:58:18] eight this
[1:58:37] come now and let us reason together
[1:58:39] saith the lord through your sins be as
[1:58:41] god though your sins be as scarlet they
[1:58:43] shall be as white as snow though they be
[1:58:45] red like crimson they shall be as wool
[1:58:53] if you be willing and obedient you shall
[1:58:55] eat the good of the land
[1:59:00] consumed
[1:59:04] but if you refuse and rebel you shall be
[1:59:07] devoured with the sword for the mouth of
[1:59:09] the lord hath spoken
[1:59:14] so we know that everything has a price
[1:59:17] problem
[1:59:20] and that's the problem that many times
[1:59:21] we don't want to pay the price
[1:59:25] but god is righteous
[1:59:41] that's why it says in romans 8 28.
[1:59:53] and we know that all things work
[1:59:54] together for good to them that love god
[1:59:56] to them who are called according to his
[1:59:58] purpose
[2:00:12] for whom he did for no he also did
[2:00:14] predestinate to be conformed to the
[2:00:16] image of the son of god
[2:00:18] that he might be the firstborn among
[2:00:20] many brethren
[2:00:30] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[2:00:32] he also called and whom he called them
[2:00:35] he also justified and whom he justified
[2:00:38] them he also glorified and says
[2:00:44] so these are the promises of god and
[2:00:45] he's waiting
[2:00:48] that every one of us
[2:00:53] while we understands life we've got the
[2:00:54] opportunity
[2:00:57] to get close to him
[2:01:03] apocalypses in the book of revelation
[2:01:10] it's got seven blessings for all those
[2:01:12] that love it
[2:01:14] those that believe in it
[2:01:19] those that are growing spiritually in
[2:01:21] that measure esta an applicant
[2:01:24] they're applying that word to their
[2:01:25] lives
[2:01:28] there's seven blessings
[2:01:31] the first says
[2:01:38] let him heal with the spirit saith unto
[2:01:39] the churches
[2:01:43] to him that overcometh will i have to
[2:01:44] eat of the hidden mana el cual esta el
[2:01:47] medio
[2:01:49] which del paraiso
[2:01:49] the midst of god's paradise
[2:01:52] that's one
[2:01:54] second
[2:01:56] the second says heather hathan here
[2:02:01] here's what the spirits say it unto the
[2:02:03] churches
[2:02:09] shall not hurt of the second death
[2:02:15] it's beautiful those are problems
[2:02:31] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[2:02:33] the churches
[2:02:38] of the hidden man
[2:02:42] and i will give him a white stone
[2:02:47] and in the stone a new name written
[2:02:50] el cual ninguno conoce which no man
[2:02:52] knoweth
[2:02:54] saving he that received
[2:03:15] and every time that the lord speaks to
[2:03:16] us through his word
[2:03:19] that we could pay attention
[2:03:24] and we could straighten up our lives
[2:03:25] with this word
[2:03:31] the last blessing that it speaks of in
[2:03:32] revelation
[2:03:35] so he that overcometh
[2:03:39] obtain all things
[2:03:42] i will be his god
[2:03:45] and he shall be my son amen amen
