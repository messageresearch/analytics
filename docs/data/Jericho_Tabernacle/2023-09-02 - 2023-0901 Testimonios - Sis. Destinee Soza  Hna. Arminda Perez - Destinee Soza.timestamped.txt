[26:17] God bless you
[26:20] my name is Destiny Souza my name is
[26:22] Destiny Sosa I'm going to share my
[26:24] testimony
[26:25] testimonial I've shared parts of it
[26:27] before
[26:30] but this will be my full one
[26:33] I want to start with the scripture
[26:37] in John 14 25 in Juan Couture
[26:42] these things I have spoken unto you
[26:46] okay these uh
[26:50] isotros being yet present with you
[26:54] but the comforter which is the Holy
[26:56] Ghost
[26:59] whom the father will send in my name
[27:03] he shall teach you all things
[27:07] and being all things to your remembrance
[27:12] whatsoever I have said unto you
[27:17] um please forgive me I'm a little
[27:18] nervous speaking up here uh
[27:24] I'd rather be way back there in the last
[27:27] few where I usually sites
[27:31] but this has been something in my heart
[27:34] that I want to share
[27:38] and I'll be happy if at least one person
[27:40] gets something small out of this
[27:46] and it's funny how when you want to do
[27:49] something for the lord
[27:52] the devil will do his best
[27:56] to throw as many punches at you as you
[27:59] can
[28:01] and believe me he's punched me a lot
[28:06] especially this last month
[28:09] I think it's been one of the hardest
[28:11] months I've had to go through
[28:16] I think he knew I was going to testify
[28:21] and the devil used every little thing
[28:23] yeah
[28:26] uh to get to me
[28:29] even up till right now
[28:32] but thank God I'm an overcomer
[28:36] and I'm here to testify yesterday
[28:39] for the honor and glory of the Lord
[28:42] I was born June 18 2003.
[28:49] to a single mother Desiree Sosa now
[28:52] Alvarado
[28:55] is
[28:58] and growing up we never really attended
[29:01] church
[29:04] my family was
[29:07] pentecostales and me and my mom would
[29:09] only attend a couple Sundays here and
[29:11] there is
[29:15] we were taught Jesus was born on
[29:17] Christmas
[29:18] Jesus
[29:20] and it was okay for women to have
[29:22] authority in the church
[29:27] and it was okay for them to wear pants
[29:30] and makeup and cut their hair is
[29:35] growing up the few Services we went to a
[29:38] year were very short
[29:41] Services
[29:44] only about an hour and 30 minutes at the
[29:47] most
[29:50] and I never had a true relationship with
[29:53] God growing up
[29:57] I would pray with my family for our food
[30:02] but that's about it
[30:05] a quick one minute prayer a couple times
[30:08] a week
[30:12] was the only time I would give God yes
[30:20] for years
[30:22] and sometimes I would hear about the
[30:24] Rapture yeah this is
[30:27] and I would get so scared
[30:30] because part of me news
[30:33] if it were to happen
[30:36] I wouldn't make it because I was not
[30:39] living right
[30:41] but now I can't wait for that glorious
[30:44] day
[30:46] I really hope I live to see it
[30:51] I yearn for it to happen
[30:54] why would I want to stay on this rotten
[30:56] Earth
[31:00] I grew up in the world
[31:02] and when I got to high school
[31:06] is when I did a lot of things from the
[31:08] world
[31:10] because that's all I knew
[31:13] I wish I could say everything I've done
[31:15] in the world
[31:18] to show how God has truly delivered me
[31:23] but I know it's best not to reveal
[31:26] things that are too deep
[31:34] I would wear ripped jeans and shorts
[31:41] on special occasions like my birthday I
[31:44] would wear makeup
[31:48] I would cut my hair
[31:51] I would listen and watch bad movies and
[31:53] songs
[31:58] I think to myself
[32:02] you know as a baby my ears were pierced
[32:07] so maybe right there my ears
[32:12] we're cut off to hearing of the word
[32:14] foreign
[32:27] I never felt bad for the worldly things
[32:29] I was doing
[32:33] so when my mom met Boaz Alvarado
[32:38] my whole life changed
[32:40] I think he really lives up to his name
[32:43] kinsman redeemer
[32:44] complex
[32:47] because he showed me and my mom this
[32:49] message
[32:52] I like to make this joke
[32:56] how my mom's Ruth
[32:59] and I'm Naomi
[33:02] the package that came along
[33:06] when I first met him
[33:10] I did not like him at all
[33:13] I really think our Spirits Clash
[33:18] because all he did was treat me with
[33:20] kindness
[33:24] but in return I would be so mean
[33:26] [Music]
[33:40] and I especially didn't like it
[33:44] when we had to go to church with him
[33:48] we went from hardly ever going to church
[33:54] to now going every Sunday and sometimes
[33:57] Friday
[34:00] my mom would have to force me to go
[34:04] and when she gave me a choice
[34:08] I would always choose to stay home
[34:12] but the times I
[34:15] would hate every second of it
[34:19] I would get there and be so mad
[34:23] because the music was so loud music
[34:27] and during the preaching
[34:30] I didn't understand anything
[34:33] because I never heard of the message
[34:39] and I never spoke Spanish
[34:42] so I would try to tune out the whole
[34:44] service
[34:50] or falling asleep
[34:54] and uh growing up I always hated to wear
[34:57] dresses and skirts
[35:02] I would prefer sweatpants and a shirt
[35:08] so going to church was something I'd
[35:10] dreaded to do
[35:14] because I had to put on a dress
[35:17] and it didn't help that I didn't know
[35:19] anybody
[35:22] so I would just stick with My Moment
[35:26] by this time I was already introduced to
[35:29] Boss family
[35:32] and whenever there was a church event
[35:36] I never wanted to socialize with anybody
[35:41] I would either stick with my mom
[35:44] or a Grace
[35:47] La Sabrina the boss because we are
[35:50] almost the same age
[35:52] and we started to get close closed
[35:54] captioning not available
[36:27] [Music]
[36:41] [Music]
[37:01] I'll never be like those people
[37:05] I'll never wear skirts or dresses
[37:09] or sing songs or be a part of church
[37:13] it's funny how things turn out
[37:17] when you say you'll never do something
[37:21] you end up doing it
[37:25] I love God for his sense of humor
[37:29] because look at what I'm doing right now
[37:33] testifying about his greatness
[37:36] but I do remember we're in service that
[37:38] I paid attention to fully uh
[37:43] it was at the church on McDowell
[37:49] McDowell and it was brother Johnny's
[37:51] sermon on love Johnny
[37:55] where he talked about the white dog and
[37:58] the black dog
[38:00] negro and that was the first sermon I
[38:03] remember thinking yes
[38:06] wow that's interesting
[38:09] so I believe right there this is
[38:12] that's where the seeded me
[38:17] got a Sprinkle of water
[38:20] Flash Forward to after covet happened
[38:26] and the church opened back up again
[38:29] I remember I was at the barbershop
[38:33] and brother Michael came in
[38:36] and he was saying how they're opening up
[38:38] youth nights again
[38:43] on Tuesdays
[38:47] and he asked me to attend
[38:50] when he asked when he asked me
[38:53] I did not want to go
[38:55] but I felt bad saying no to him
[39:00] so I reluctantly agreed to sing
[39:05] and brother Michael knows when I first
[39:07] met him
[39:10] I did not like him at all
[39:13] and I don't know why
[39:15] he was always nice
[39:18] maybe our spirit class he says
[39:21] but thankfully I apologize to Michael
[39:24] program
[39:26] and now I really look up to him
[39:30] and his wife
[39:32] and I love them
[39:34] so after I attended Tuesday night this
[39:37] was
[39:39] even though I was forced to go
[39:42] and when I went I did not want to talk
[39:46] to anybody
[39:47] which is funny because the people I
[39:50] never wanted to talk to
[39:54] are now some of my best friends
[39:58] it's great it's a great thing to have
[40:01] friends of like faith is
[40:05] I'm very thankful for them
[40:08] that week I attended Tuesday is
[40:12] I also attended Wednesday Friday and
[40:15] Sunday
[40:17] and for the first time
[40:20] I went on my own
[40:23] and actually paid attention
[40:30] and it felt kind of nice
[40:34] so I kept going and going after that
[40:40] Faith cometh by hearing
[40:42] and for the first time
[40:45] I started to listen more and more
[40:49] the seeds started to grow little by
[40:51] little
[41:00] because my attitude started to change
[41:04] towards the people of My Life
[41:09] um some of the people that know me now
[41:12] [Music]
[41:14] they tell me that I'm loud
[41:18] energetic
[41:21] kind of funny
[41:23] um
[41:24] uh nice
[41:26] but I used to be very mean
[41:34] stuck in my ways type of person um
[41:38] and as I attended church
[41:42] and started to hear and accept the word
[41:46] my heart began to softening
[41:51] he really will take that old Stony heart
[41:53] and give you a new one
[41:58] God has bust my life so much
[42:03] one of the things I always wanted as a
[42:06] kid
[42:09] Nina was to have a dad
[42:12] all my life I was without my head
[42:17] because the father is the head of the
[42:19] children
[42:21] maybe that's why I'm a little bit crazy
[42:28] because I was walking around headless
[42:31] for so long
[42:34] and I barely got my dad when I was 16.
[42:41] but in the Lord's perfect timing
[42:47] he gave it to me
[42:50] I can't understand why things happened
[42:52] the way they did
[42:56] but if things didn't happen that way
[43:00] I would have never heard of the message
[43:05] and I would still be doing those worldly
[43:07] things I used to do
[43:11] maybe even worse
[43:13] but God's plan is mysterious
[43:17] and rather trying to explain it
[43:21] I choose to believe it
[43:24] God is so good
[43:26] because I always wanted a father
[43:29] and he gave it to me
[43:31] but not only your father
[43:34] he gave me a great message believing
[43:37] family as well
[43:39] that I love very much
[43:43] and I thank God
[43:45] because it's one of the biggest
[43:47] blessings in my life
[43:50] with everything happening to me
[43:54] and me starting to change
[43:57] I decided I needed to get baptized
[44:01] because I heard brother Branham say
[44:04] you need to get baptized
[44:07] to enter the kingdom of God
[44:11] so I took that first step
[44:14] and on August 22nd yeah
[44:17] I got baptized
[44:20] uh now I never asked the Lord to change
[44:22] my life
[44:25] before I got baptized
[44:27] I would still wear pants
[44:30] outside of the church
[44:33] but when the Holy Ghost comes
[44:38] it makes you walk different
[44:41] talk differently think different
[44:45] be different
[44:46] dress different
[44:48] that's what the Lord did with me
[44:52] so that Wednesday after I got baptized
[44:55] on Sunday
[44:58] I went to church
[45:00] and the tape was
[45:03] the choosing of a bride is and when I
[45:07] was listening to the tape
[45:10] my ears and eyes were opened
[45:14] the Bible States in
[45:17] deuteronomyo 22 5. Cinco the woman shall
[45:22] not wear that which pertaineth unto a
[45:24] man
[45:28] neither shall a man put on a woman's
[45:31] garment
[45:34] for all that do so
[45:39] are an Abomination is
[45:44] I was taught growing up it's okay for
[45:47] women to wear pants
[45:53] and I've worn them my whole life
[45:56] at first I never understood why it was
[45:59] wrong
[46:03] but I never really asked or took the
[46:05] time to find out why it was wrong
[46:12] when I heard that a woman's hair is
[46:14] recovering
[46:18] I stopped cutting my hair
[46:21] and I only wore makeup on special
[46:23] occasions
[46:27] so it's easy to give that up
[46:32] but I struggled with wearing pants
[46:34] outside of the church
[46:39] but when I fully heard
[46:43] and learned why it is
[46:50] um
[46:51] I decided to stop
[46:53] the tape taught me many things
[46:58] and I wanted to apply it all to my life
[47:02] I heard brother Branham say
[47:06] the Modern Bride wears shorts
[47:11] wears pants
[47:13] cuts off her hair
[47:15] wears clothes that look like a man
[47:18] brother Branham also says
[47:21] Christ Ain't Gonna Take a Ride Like That
[47:27] hearing that made me not want to
[47:29] represent the Modern Bride
[47:35] I want to represent the true bride
[47:39] the brother Branham saw in his vision
[47:44] he said and coming this way
[47:48] was the lovely bunch of women
[48:17] with the cross of Jesus going on Jesus
[48:22] and as they pass by
[48:25] I stood there
[48:27] was something there yeah some Spirit
[48:31] was God and I said there is my bride
[48:36] that's the bread I want to
[48:39] representative brother Branham also says
[48:43] women I want you to look in the mirror
[48:47] and look at what God requires the women
[48:50] to do
[48:52] and see in God's mirror
[48:56] not in your church
[48:59] now it's in God's mirror
[49:02] and see if you could qualify
[49:05] in your life
[49:07] the spiritual bride of Jesus Christ
[49:12] I thought to myself
[49:14] how can I qualify to be the bride
[49:18] and firstly
[49:20] my appearance didn't match it
[49:23] after hearing these words of the prophet
[49:27] and the Bible
[49:29] I made a decision
[49:31] to throw away all my pants
[49:35] because I didn't want to be an
[49:36] Abomination
[49:40] I also went home
[49:42] and took all my decorations off my walls
[49:47] before my walls were filled with movies
[49:52] and posters
[49:56] with worldly music artists
[50:00] but when I heard brother Branham say
[50:03] if I go to a man's office
[50:08] and he says he's a Christian
[50:10] Cristiano Pinups all around the world
[50:15] that old Boogie Woogie music going on
[50:20] I don't care what he says I'm
[50:32] so I also gave up listening to worldly
[50:34] music and this is
[50:38] but the devil never stops trying to
[50:41] tempt me
[50:45] when I walk into a store
[50:49] oh I overhear music from someone else
[50:53] it seems like they always play the songs
[50:56] I used to love
[51:00] but these words stick with me every day
[51:05] every day I remind myself to represent
[51:07] God's word
[51:11] I can't say oh I'll wear skirts and
[51:13] dresses in church
[51:20] and going other places I'll wear pants
[51:24] brother Branham says that's what we try
[51:27] to do today
[51:30] in our textbooks
[51:32] is try to make the word
[51:36] which is Christ
[51:41] instead of us
[51:43] trying to make ourselves
[51:49] I have to make myself suit the word
[51:53] by representing it
[51:56] and dressing how the Bible tells me too
[52:00] the devil tried to throw a punch at me
[52:05] every child that comes to God must be
[52:07] tested
[52:11] and he tried
[52:14] because during that time I was working
[52:16] in fast food
[52:19] restaurants and I kept asking my boss
[52:25] if I could wear skirts to work
[52:30] because at first I would wear pants
[52:34] but then I had my Revolution
[52:37] and she would always come up with an
[52:39] excuse
[52:42] as to why I couldn't
[52:46] and I asked her a bunch of times
[52:50] but she just kept coming up with excuses
[52:54] so I made the decision to throw away all
[52:56] my pants
[52:59] and the devil throws his first punch at
[53:02] me
[53:04] by having me still wear them to work
[53:09] and I remember
[53:12] every time I put that only pair of jeans
[53:14] on I had
[53:19] I would apologize
[53:33] but by God's grace
[53:35] I was able to quit that job
[53:39] and finally throw away that last pair of
[53:41] jeans
[53:45] and from then on
[53:48] I haven't worn a pair of jeans since
[53:50] then
[53:52] God has helped me with so many things
[53:57] appearance and internally wise
[54:03] here are some small examples as well
[54:08] I would come to church
[54:11] and at first I was scared to raise my
[54:13] hands
[54:16] whenever I heard something that made me
[54:19] think amen
[54:22] amen the devil would whisper to me
[54:25] nobody else is raising their hands
[54:29] you're going to be the only one and
[54:33] you're going to embarrass yourself
[54:35] but now I'll define gravity
[54:39] like brother Branham says
[54:42] and I'll raise my hand to the word of
[54:44] God
[54:46] and I'll say Amen to it
[54:49] I used to have long painted fake nails
[54:54] because I bite my nails
[54:58] and I thought my hands looked nicer with
[55:00] acrylic painted nails
[55:07] but I heard brother Branham
[55:13] a husband coming home to his wife
[55:17] and he says
[55:19] how would you like to come home
[55:21] overnight
[55:25] for your Devotion to your wife
[55:30] and she's got a bunch of little children
[55:34] and you find that day you said yeah and
[55:37] when she comes in
[55:39] oh this is all her nails may be painted
[55:44] that is
[55:46] you are of the world
[55:49] so in my heart
[55:51] I did not want to look like any part of
[55:53] the world
[55:57] so I stopped painting my nails
[56:02] I also told myself
[56:04] I would never sing in church
[56:08] because I can't sing good
[56:10] and it's scary to get up here
[56:15] in front of everybody
[56:18] but I've done it several times already
[56:22] the Bible says Make a Joyful Noise unto
[56:27] the Lord
[56:31] and uh last year at Camp
[56:33] is
[56:35] I had a really great experience with the
[56:37] Lord
[56:39] I've said this testimony before
[56:44] but I'll say it again
[56:46] because it's worth testifying about it
[56:49] twice
[56:54] before coming to camp and this is people
[56:58] would ask me if I was ready
[57:01] and I would say yes I'm coming with
[57:03] expectations
[57:06] because I had some things I was
[57:08] struggling with
[57:11] and I knew at Camp I would receive
[57:13] something
[57:15] and during Saturday's prayer line
[57:19] I felt the presence of the Lord really
[57:21] hard
[57:24] one of the ministers
[57:26] told me to open my heart fully to the
[57:29] Lord
[57:32] and he asked me what I wanted from the
[57:34] Lord
[57:36] and I told him some desires from my
[57:38] heart
[57:40] and he prayed for me and towards the end
[57:44] of the prayer
[57:45] he put his hands on my forehead
[57:48] and it was like he casted something out
[57:53] that I was struggling with
[57:56] and that's when I felt so light and
[57:58] liberated
[58:01] I fell back
[58:03] [Music]
[58:05] but I continued to walk through the line
[58:09] and a couple steps after falling
[58:14] my hands and arms started to shake
[58:16] really hard
[58:20] my arms felt so heavy
[58:23] I felt that they started to go down
[58:27] and the brothers were trying to hold
[58:29] them up
[58:31] I just felt like I was gonna fall on the
[58:34] floor
[58:36] again because I felt God's present
[58:39] presence very strongly
[58:43] walking to that line
[58:46] and at the end of the line I was guided
[58:48] to a chair
[58:51] and when I sat down I stopped shaking
[58:55] and I just covered my face
[58:59] with my hands and leaned over
[59:03] and I kept crying and praying and
[59:05] thanking the Lord
[59:09] my face and head felt super hot
[59:14] like fire on my head
[59:17] and after I calm down
[59:20] I felt so tired and drained
[59:23] like I couldn't get up
[59:27] so I just stayed there listening to the
[59:29] music
[59:32] worshiping God after the service
[59:35] I come from the world
[59:38] and there's no better feeling than the
[59:40] presence of God
[59:45] never in my life did I imagine I'd be
[59:48] here
[59:50] but by God's grace and mercy I'm here
[59:55] I've said this before
[59:58] but it's true it's like eating at
[1:00:01] McDonald's your whole life
[1:00:04] in McDonald's and then getting to eat at
[1:00:06] Longhorn Steakhouse
[1:00:09] restaurants
[1:00:12] why would I ever want to go back to
[1:00:14] McDonald's
[1:00:17] I was born 20 years ago
[1:00:20] but really only been living for two
[1:00:23] years
[1:00:24] and I thank God for these beautiful two
[1:00:27] years
[1:00:31] see Revelations and experiences
[1:00:36] and as my favorite song says
[1:00:40] just remember when you're standing
[1:00:44] in the valley of decisions
[1:00:47] and the adversary says
[1:00:54] our Lord will show up
[1:00:57] and he'll take you to the fire again
[1:01:01] I realized everything God has given me
[1:01:05] at first I've tried to push it away or
[1:01:07] ignore it
[1:01:13] because I I was a person who didn't like
[1:01:15] change
[1:01:18] I did it with the message
[1:01:21] my friends and family
[1:01:24] my parents
[1:01:26] but then I realized
[1:01:29] everything he does
[1:01:47] and sometimes the devil yeah Diablo can
[1:01:51] make it seem like he's not answering
[1:01:55] but like another one of my favorite
[1:01:57] songs says
[1:02:01] tell me a time he's not been faithful
[1:02:05] tell me a morning his mercies weren't
[1:02:07] new foreign
[1:02:31] in retrospector you're gonna find
[1:02:33] there's never a time
[1:02:36] and I have come to accept and love it
[1:02:41] and be so thankful for everything God
[1:02:44] has done
[1:02:47] and by God's grace
[1:02:49] he continues to bless me
[1:02:52] even though sometimes I first can't see
[1:02:55] it
[1:02:58] he still does
[1:03:00] I just have to keep continuing to trust
[1:03:03] his plan
[1:03:07] um I don't want to get to heaven and God
[1:03:08] tell me
[1:03:11] depart from me for I never knew you
[1:03:13] apart
[1:03:15] but I know he won't say that
[1:03:19] because I've had a true experience in
[1:03:23] relationship with Christ
[1:03:27] even now after all the experience I've
[1:03:29] gone through
[1:03:41] I can't even remember how all the books
[1:03:43] of the Bibles go
[1:03:47] I still need to look at that first page
[1:03:49] to tell me what page number the book is
[1:03:55] [Music]
[1:03:59] I still can't quote brother Branham or
[1:04:01] scripture from memory
[1:04:06] and the devil uses that against me
[1:04:10] but God reminds me
[1:04:13] and I've heard several sermons
[1:04:17] on how it's good to have intellectual
[1:04:19] knowledge is
[1:04:23] but if that's all you have
[1:04:26] it does you know
[1:04:28] I heard a preacher say
[1:04:32] I pray that I'm never the kind of
[1:04:34] believer
[1:04:36] they can pass the doctrinal exam
[1:04:41] but fail at the life
[1:04:44] but thank God for his saving grace and
[1:04:47] mercy
[1:04:49] records because I was on a terrible path
[1:04:54] and God picked me up
[1:04:56] and turn me around
[1:04:59] and I think about it a lot
[1:05:02] and it brings me to tears
[1:05:05] because of how I was living a very
[1:05:09] worldly life
[1:05:11] but thankfully now I can say I'm a
[1:05:13] Christian program
[1:05:17] I hope to be a big tree
[1:05:21] with lots of shade
[1:05:25] right now I'm just a small stick
[1:05:29] maybe one or two
[1:05:32] but I pray to God that I'll continue to
[1:05:35] walk down this straight narrow path
[1:05:39] for as long as I'm in this earth
[1:05:43] and trust me
[1:05:46] just because I'm a born-again
[1:05:49] Christianity it doesn't make it easy
[1:05:53] because I still struggle with a lot of
[1:05:55] things
[1:05:57] and as long as I'm in this flesh
[1:06:00] the devil will never stop trying
[1:06:04] I know I messed up
[1:06:07] I still sometimes get mad
[1:06:10] I get sad
[1:06:12] sometimes life would just tear me down
[1:06:16] the devil will continue to kick me
[1:06:20] when I'm down
[1:06:22] and he tries to make me stay down
[1:06:26] he does a really good job at that
[1:06:30] he'll tell me things like
[1:06:35] you go up to the altar too much
[1:06:39] that experience wasn't real it's
[1:06:41] experience why are you still getting mad
[1:06:43] if you have the Holy ghosts
[1:06:47] the devil can make those things get to
[1:06:49] me
[1:06:51] but I have to remember
[1:06:54] that the devil's just trying to take my
[1:06:56] eyes off Christ
[1:06:59] and make me doubt when things of Life
[1:07:01] start to get heavy yes
[1:07:05] and uh recently I've been studying the
[1:07:08] subject of love
[1:07:11] no not that filio kind
[1:07:15] but that real genuine Agape
[1:07:20] because I know I sometimes struggle with
[1:07:23] that
[1:07:25] showing love
[1:07:27] especially because I'm in this flesh
[1:07:31] and sometimes it can be easier yeah this
[1:07:33] is to love one brother
[1:07:36] versus that other brother
[1:07:39] but I want to
[1:07:41] and I'm praying to get to that point
[1:07:45] where I'm like Jesus
[1:07:48] where he knew Judas would betray him
[1:07:52] but still called him friend
[1:07:55] even with brother Branham
[1:07:57] you couldn't tell his enemy from his
[1:08:00] friends
[1:08:02] I know that I have to die to myself and
[1:08:05] my pride yourself
[1:08:10] when the devil tries to get me with
[1:08:15] why didn't they invite you there
[1:08:20] or oh they talk about you behind your
[1:08:22] back
[1:08:26] or they're not as good as friend as you
[1:08:28] thought
[1:08:31] they didn't even tell you happy birthday
[1:08:35] but I have to get over that fleshly
[1:08:37] thinking
[1:08:40] and just replace it with love
[1:08:43] I used to struggle a lot with being too
[1:08:45] prideful
[1:08:49] and I still do sometimes
[1:08:52] and it's hard to apologize to people
[1:08:57] I'm not very good at it
[1:09:00] but uh now I get corrected by the spirit
[1:09:04] of Christ
[1:09:06] and I go and apologize when I make
[1:09:09] things wrong
[1:09:12] I have to have love for everybody
[1:09:15] because we're going to spend eternity
[1:09:17] together
[1:09:19] and sometimes men will fail you yeah
[1:09:22] this is
[1:09:23] but there's one that will never fail me
[1:09:26] I'd rather have faith in doubt and
[1:09:30] have faith that one day
[1:09:32] I have a body change
[1:09:35] where the devil can't tempt me no more
[1:09:39] and I'll reign with my Lord in eternity
[1:09:41] forever
[1:09:44] so I'll continue on this path
[1:09:48] even after I Stumble
[1:09:51] I'll just get back up again
[1:09:53] and continue walking
[1:09:56] all the pain and suffering will be worth
[1:09:58] it
[1:10:00] because I love the Lord
[1:10:02] and if I have to do a little bit of
[1:10:05] suffering here on the Earth
[1:10:08] but the outcome is I get to go to heaven
[1:10:12] I'll take that little bit of suffering
[1:10:17] for an eternity of Peace
[1:10:20] like the woman says
[1:10:22] I'm not what I ought to be
[1:10:25] and I'm not what I want to be
[1:10:28] but I'm not what I used to be
[1:10:59] he he's going to have a bride
[1:11:03] that hasn't got a wrinkle in here
[1:11:06] amen amen she's wholly Washed by the
[1:11:09] blood yes
[1:11:11] of his own self de El mismo that's right
[1:11:14] I see yes so we see where we stand
[1:11:18] the wedding getting ready to come
[1:11:21] inside thank you
[1:11:30] thank you
[1:12:42] thank you
[1:12:52] a blessing
[1:12:54] it's the
[1:12:55] um
[1:13:04] now Mom when you were coming from a
[1:13:06] Catholic Church
[1:13:12] apostolica how did you become a
[1:13:14] Christian in coming into the Apostolic
[1:13:16] Church
[1:13:17] foreign
[1:13:27] I was born in a Christian Church
[1:13:31] my parents would scold me
[1:13:36] because I wouldn't go to the Catholic
[1:13:38] Church
[1:13:40] I would go to the Catholic church
[1:13:43] but I would always leave
[1:13:47] because I didn't want to hear
[1:13:50] what the father was saying
[1:13:53] I never believed
[1:13:58] he would say to my mom
[1:14:01] no more this is uh don't bother arminda
[1:14:06] yeah because she get it
[1:14:11] believes in just one God
[1:14:14] yes
[1:14:15] and that's her decision
[1:14:21] is
[1:14:24] and I always believe that there was only
[1:14:27] one God
[1:14:31] my father my mother believed in many
[1:14:34] gods
[1:14:36] I would go to the Catholic church
[1:14:39] and I would see the Saints
[1:14:44] I would start trembling and quivering
[1:14:47] I would see the Saints
[1:14:49] and I said he's going to fall on me he's
[1:14:52] going to kill me
[1:14:55] see
[1:14:56] foreign
[1:15:10] don't take her to church because she's
[1:15:12] not there with any kind of devotion
[1:15:16] she just laughs at the saints that are
[1:15:18] hanging up yeah and that's true
[1:15:22] I could see the Saints hanging on the
[1:15:25] walls
[1:15:26] and I would say oh they're going to
[1:15:28] follow me they're going to kill me
[1:15:31] I think it's better if I don't go to
[1:15:33] church
[1:15:35] I would go to the church but then I
[1:15:37] would go outside
[1:15:39] when my mom would go look for me yes I
[1:15:44] was already outside
[1:15:54] and she would say nothing's gonna happen
[1:15:56] to you
[1:15:57] just sit down and just stay there
[1:16:04] and so I would go out buy something I
[1:16:07] would go back in and eat eat in church
[1:16:13] foreign they would say you can't eat
[1:16:16] here but I would say I'm really hungry
[1:16:19] and I would keep eating in church
[1:16:23] my mom would make me get up
[1:16:32] and they would take me to the place
[1:16:34] where you do the sign of the cross and
[1:16:36] my mom would say she would put her hand
[1:16:40] on my forehead
[1:16:41] yeah and then I would rub my forehead I
[1:16:45] would take away that cross that she made
[1:16:46] yeah
[1:16:52] and she would say this is
[1:16:56] It's holy water it's really dirty
[1:16:59] because everyone puts their finger in
[1:17:00] there hmm
[1:17:36] what that father says that father
[1:17:40] foreign
[1:18:10] from my parents
[1:18:13] they would have Services drop s
[1:18:17] I would say Mom I'm going to the park to
[1:18:20] go play with the ball
[1:18:24] because I was in a team and we would
[1:18:26] play so I remember
[1:18:29] I would go but I was lying I wouldn't go
[1:18:32] to play I went to church
[1:18:46] I didn't go to church
[1:18:49] I was playing at the park
[1:18:55] what if I hit you
[1:18:58] just hit me I'm saying Peter when
[1:19:02] actually I was saying
[1:19:04] what I'm telling you is the truth
[1:19:07] my mom would say bye-bye to my dad
[1:19:14] she believes in those Holy Rollers
[1:19:18] she believes in that
[1:19:21] and we can't take that away from you
[1:19:23] because she believes
[1:19:29] not so many gods
[1:19:39] and I really didn't like that scene
[1:19:44] one day I turned to look at him
[1:19:48] I got the scissors
[1:19:50] and I cut off the string and he fell
[1:19:54] area then
[1:19:55] I jumped on him and I stomped and
[1:19:58] stopped until I fully broke it it does
[1:20:03] and then my mom came afterwards she said
[1:20:07] she said look at the same
[1:20:09] he did a miracle
[1:20:15] is
[1:20:18] she began to piece them together and I
[1:20:21] would just laugh yeah
[1:20:24] but I would say mom that Saint isn't
[1:20:27] worth anything
[1:20:28] she said just be quiet
[1:20:34] anything that I told you Mom is the
[1:20:36] truth
[1:20:37] and she would just laughs
[1:20:41] she wouldn't say anything
[1:20:45] and my father would say it's because
[1:20:50] there's only one God with you
[1:20:54] you believe in many gods
[1:20:59] I just believe in one true God
[1:21:07] with your Gods I'll continue with mine
[1:21:12] and then I guess yes
[1:21:15] that's fine I won't bother anymore
[1:21:20] I'll let you know
[1:21:22] what you're believing in
[1:21:25] um
[1:21:32] and how did you come to the Apostolic
[1:21:34] Church
[1:21:38] what was the medium
[1:21:42] there were some sisters
[1:21:45] that would go to the church yes
[1:21:49] and they would invite me and I would go
[1:21:51] Gutierrez
[1:21:58] she began to talk to me
[1:22:02] of the Gospel
[1:22:05] yes
[1:22:10] and that's how I began to go to the
[1:22:12] Apostolic Church
[1:22:17] what church and where was that church
[1:22:20] that you used to go to
[1:22:22] become
[1:22:24] Iglesias apostolica
[1:22:37] in the Apostolic Church there was a few
[1:22:41] people there you don't understand why I
[1:22:42] say Iglesia and what was that church
[1:22:45] it was in Juarez
[1:22:48] and they're in the city of Juarez
[1:22:52] hey
[1:22:54] yes
[1:22:55] and that's where we would go
[1:22:58] to the Apostolic Church
[1:23:04] there was a few people there
[1:23:07] is
[1:23:10] but the few that were there were such a
[1:23:12] great blessing
[1:23:15] such a great blessing
[1:23:21] who afterwards became the pastor of that
[1:23:24] church
[1:23:30] there was a brother there that would go
[1:23:33] his name was Nicolas Trejo
[1:23:38] you would go there to the Apostolic
[1:23:41] Church
[1:23:46] who built and founded that church
[1:23:55] some brothers there that were from El
[1:23:58] Paso that they were the ones that
[1:23:59] started the church
[1:24:03] from El Paso Texas they're they're the
[1:24:05] ones that started the church you
[1:24:10] and they would go visit there
[1:24:13] and they would preach them
[1:24:16] those brothers would
[1:24:22] see
[1:24:24] yeah
[1:24:32] and then afterwards it was a pastor
[1:24:35] his name was Thomas Santos he would give
[1:24:38] us God's word
[1:24:44] and there he stayed with us
[1:24:47] he would have preached to us
[1:25:31] and then afterwards Brothers started
[1:25:33] coming and coming
[1:25:39] and I don't think they really liked it
[1:25:41] because they would only last two Sundays
[1:25:43] and then they would leave
[1:25:46] but then they would pick up an offering
[1:25:51] and brother Amado
[1:25:55] would give the offering to the pastor
[1:25:59] foreign
[1:26:21] then they wouldn't come back
[1:26:25] they were just there for the interest
[1:26:26] for money to be offering
[1:26:41] I
[1:26:47] was always glorifying and praising his
[1:26:50] name
[1:26:51] is
[1:26:57] we're born in the truth
[1:27:03] they were all presented to the Lord
[1:27:07] and when I would go visit my mom and my
[1:27:11] dad
[1:27:14] did you baptize the children
[1:27:18] and says what churches you baptize them
[1:27:21] yeah and the one up there
[1:27:36] you need to take them to the father
[1:27:39] why would I take him to the father
[1:27:44] I would say mom you know I don't believe
[1:27:47] in such a father
[1:27:50] when I was little you would take me
[1:27:54] you would take me
[1:27:57] because you would pinch me I know you
[1:28:00] were because I wouldn't go
[1:28:02] very young but then I grew up and you
[1:28:05] stopped yeah thankfully
[1:28:10] mama
[1:28:13] at what age were you baptized in the
[1:28:15] Apostolic Church
[1:28:25] I don't recall
[1:28:29] s
[1:28:33] [Music]
[1:28:39] do you remember what year the brother
[1:28:40] Banner's message came to the episode
[1:28:44] in 1976

[1:29:01] message came
[1:29:15] brother Francisco facio Pastor he was
[1:29:18] the pastor
[1:29:20] mm-hmm
[1:29:22] any money
[1:29:24] from Brother Francisco fasi was a pastor
[1:29:29] and then he would preach to us
[1:29:34] he would preach really hard to us
[1:29:39] and
[1:29:41] then I would ask him brother
[1:29:45] so hard to us we're already in the words
[1:29:54] and he would say oh yeah but I said it's
[1:29:57] too hard
[1:30:00] and he said well that's how it is
[1:30:12] and some people left even my husband
[1:30:15] left
[1:30:18] and my husband left and he said I he
[1:30:21] said let's go to such and such church I
[1:30:24] said no this is my church
[1:30:29] he says no you have to be with me
[1:30:31] wherever I go
[1:30:32] they don't know and I said uh
[1:30:37] what business do I have in other
[1:30:40] churches
[1:30:41] if they don't
[1:30:44] keep the their word at that church
[1:30:48] and I would stay
[1:30:50] he would get upset but oh well
[1:30:54] one day he'll get happy about it
