[41:25] what happened with with your
[41:29] testimony and she told me there was a
[41:31] little correction there and uh what

[41:37] said but she started to share her
[41:42] testimony with brother
[41:44] Bram and I'm going to let her say it of
[41:49] course but one thing that I asked sister

[42:14] presence and she looked at me

[42:19] and made me want to cry

[52:43] gone thank
[52:47] you I'm scared of
[52:50] death but
[52:54] um I've
[52:55] been asked to do this and
[52:59] uh I I I didn't want to I I I was a
[53:04] wreck about it but I prayed about it
[53:10] and there's a lot of people that didn't
[53:12] have the
[53:14] privilege that I'd
[53:19] had and I told myself I wasn't going to
[53:21] do
[53:24] this I don't want to
[53:28] overemphasize the re relationship that
[53:31] our family had with brother
[53:34] brandham I mean it's not like we were
[53:37] best friends and back and
[53:41] forth but neither do I want to minimize
[53:48] it because it was the greatest
[53:52] honor to be in his me
[53:56] meetings to have him in our
[54:01] home to breathe the same
[54:05] air in in in the room with
[54:09] him it wasn't
[54:13] blessing and not just him his
[54:16] children grandchild it was an
[54:21] honor
[54:23] so I was born in Long Beach
[54:27] California Long Beach California and
[54:29] raised in the Los Angeles
[54:33] area a little town
[54:36] Wilmington wilington went to a little
[54:38] Pentecostal Church
[54:42] there and we went to church I mean if
[54:44] the door was open we were there might
[54:46] there was no question if the door was
[54:48] open we were
[54:54] there so I saw a lot of
[54:58] ministers
[54:59] missionaries
[55:01] evangelists come through our little
[55:05] church and then one day my daddy heard
[55:08] about an evangelist William
[55:13] brandham BR so when he was in the area
[55:17] anywhere in the area we would try to go
[55:19] to his
[55:24] service my dad says I was in meetings
[55:28] like in 47 48 I don't I don't have a
[55:31] memory of those I was very
[55:38] young but I
[55:41] remember some of my earliest memories I
[55:44] think it was when I was like nine or 10
[55:46] maybe
[55:49] eight and I remember the I I remember
[55:53] the angelist temple I remember remember
[55:55] that making such an impression on
[56:01] me and places like Clifton's Cafeteria I
[56:04] can see it you know in my mind's eye
[56:06] right
[56:11] now and then there was a place called
[56:15] brother brandom I heard it the other day
[56:16] referred to it and we called it the Cow
[56:23] Palace Palace it was actually um let's
[56:27] see I wrote it down cuz I wanted to look
[56:29] it up and be sure it was called the
[56:31] Great Western exhibit Center Great
[56:35] Western exhibit Center it was like a big
[56:37] where they auctioned off
[56:43] livestock like a Fairgrounds like
[56:47] thing so we went there one night and my
[56:51] dad got us and got our seats
[56:56] and then he had one of those little 8
[56:59] mm movie
[57:03] cameras and he wanted to go out back and
[57:07] try to get a picture of brother brandom
[57:09] as they were bringing him
[57:14] in and I can remember you know just a
[57:17] little girl I was saying Daddy Daddy
[57:19] please let me go with you I want to go
[57:20] with
[57:23] you
[57:26] and I don't know what it was
[57:29] but that man made an impression on me as
[57:32] a little
[57:35] girl I knew he wasn't like those other
[57:37] ministers and missionaries and
[57:39] evangelists that we'd had you know that
[57:40] I'd
[57:45] seen and I know this sounds kind of
[57:48] silly or crazy but I not only did I want
[57:50] to go out there so I could see him I
[57:52] wanted I can remember this thought
[57:54] thought in my mind I wanted him to see
[58:02] me I wanted him to look at
[58:06] me I that's just what I
[58:09] remember thank you so anyway in in
[58:17] 57 my dad we moved from the Los Angeles
[58:21] area to
[58:23] Phoenix
[58:25] and he went to work for Brother John
[58:29] shered and if you don't you'll remember
[58:32] when I tell you he was the man that
[58:34] brother brandham talked about that had
[58:36] the citrus tree there in his yard that
[58:39] he grafted the various uh kinds of
[58:44] citrus into that one tree you remember
[58:45] that story he told about
[58:51] that so my dad went to work for for
[58:56] him and that I'll just tell you if
[58:59] you've ever wondered where that was
[59:02] there many times he he had brother Sher
[59:05] had a big house and then in the back he
[59:08] had a
[59:09] little a little room where he had a
[59:12] printing press he he printed
[59:15] Evangelistic like literature he he would
[59:17] print about brother bram's meetings and
[59:19] he just had a little uh
[59:23] religious um uh publication that he put
[59:26] out so he had this house a little
[59:28] printing press and a little house out
[59:31] back where Paul knows that my aunt wona
[59:35] and my Uncle Jimmy
[59:46] lived yeah I was over there many times
[59:48] and where that little tree was that was
[59:50] on actually it was on Third Street in
[59:51] Palm Lane it's downtown Phoenix now
[59:53] there's off office building there and
[59:55] but it was on right on the corner of
[59:57] Third Street in Palm
[1:00:02] Lane pal
[1:00:05] Lane
[1:00:06] and I'm trying
[1:00:08] to we went when we moved here we went to
[1:00:12] Brother Outlaw's church and I know
[1:00:14] brother Brandon mentions
[1:00:18] him in fact
[1:00:21] if yeah you want to put that I
[1:00:25] there's a picture of brother brandham
[1:00:27] coming out of brother Outlaw's church
[1:00:33] and oh no not that one no the
[1:00:38] one no none of those yeah that
[1:00:41] one that was brother brandham coming out
[1:00:44] in this church brother outlas was on
[1:00:47] 20th Street in Diamond it was one block
[1:00:50] north of
[1:00:53] Roosevelt
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:00:58] Roos and that's me in that black skirt
[1:01:02] and white uh
[1:01:08] blouse and I like that picture because
[1:01:11] you know how it is when there's special
[1:01:13] meetings and the teenagers they want
[1:01:15] want to run out there and be with their
[1:01:17] friends and all I wanted to do is be
[1:01:19] close to
[1:01:23] him
[1:01:30] I just remember you know standing there
[1:01:32] looking at him in
[1:01:37] awe I was probably about 15 there I
[1:01:42] think I didn't know that picture existed
[1:01:45] for 20 or 30 years my aunt called me one
[1:01:51] day she said I'm going through some old
[1:01:53] pictures and I found want brother brand
[1:01:56] do you think and you're in there too do
[1:01:58] you want it I
[1:02:06] yes so I I don't even know who took it
[1:02:08] but I was very happy to have
[1:02:12] that so I'm GNA I'm going to jump
[1:02:17] over many of you may have seen my
[1:02:23] husband and you know I was raised in
[1:02:25] church and saw brother Bram as a young
[1:02:29] daughter young
[1:02:33] girl and
[1:02:35] Mike Mike didn't he was an
[1:02:41] atheist didn't believe in
[1:02:43] God thought people that went to church
[1:02:46] just they just needed a crutch something
[1:02:48] to lean
[1:02:53] on so he was he was from Texas he had
[1:02:57] after school he hitchhiked out to
[1:02:58] California and was just kind of buming
[1:03:05] around so he decided it was time to go
[1:03:07] back home to
[1:03:10] Texas and he ran out of money in
[1:03:14] Phoenix Phoenix so he had to just get a
[1:03:16] job so he could get
[1:03:20] back but he never got
[1:03:23] back kind of got a hook in
[1:03:26] him so he was on this job and he heard
[1:03:30] a a Christian man and a non-Christian
[1:03:34] man they were kind of debating all
[1:03:41] day and Mike thought that Christian man
[1:03:45] I think he's I think he might be
[1:03:52] genuine so that man kind of took Mike
[1:03:55] under his wing Mike didn't know one
[1:03:57] person in Phoenix he didn't know a
[1:04:04] soul so he he told Mike he said there's
[1:04:09] a there's a little preacher in town he's
[1:04:12] goes around to some little churches and
[1:04:14] you want to go with me
[1:04:21] tonight so mik said okay
[1:04:25] Mike and later he told me why did I say
[1:04:27] okay I don't even believe in that stuff
[1:04:29] I don't know why he said
[1:04:34] okay but he walked in to that little
[1:04:38] church and he said the minute brother
[1:04:41] brandham walked
[1:04:45] out this is his words he said my heart
[1:04:52] melted and he said something spoke to to
[1:04:54] his
[1:04:55] heart and said this man cannot lie to
[1:05:00] you so Mike said I didn't know what he
[1:05:02] was going to say but I knew it was going
[1:05:03] to be
[1:05:07] true and that very night I mean
[1:05:10] an atheist off the
[1:05:15] street at the end of the service brother
[1:05:18] brandham asked if anyone wanted to come
[1:05:20] down and give their heart to
[1:05:23] God
[1:05:25] and he went straight to the
[1:05:28] Altar and what's strange about that
[1:05:32] is brother brandham said it's usually
[1:05:35] women but there's there's four young men
[1:05:38] down here
[1:05:44] tonight and he said is there any
[1:05:47] ministers out there that would come up
[1:05:49] and
[1:05:51] pray and brother Jerry am along with was
[1:05:54] sitting out in that
[1:05:57] audience and he said the Lord spoke to
[1:05:59] him and told him to go pray with
[1:06:03] Mike and they be they became very good
[1:06:06] friends
[1:06:10] later but um those those meetings is
[1:06:13] where Mike and I
[1:06:15] met so he never got back to
[1:06:22] Texas uh I don't want to
[1:06:26] okay when I when I graduated high
[1:06:30] school my aunt gave me a little camera a
[1:06:33] little Kodak
[1:06:36] camera and so right after that I went
[1:06:40] with my parents to Hot Springs
[1:06:43] Arkansas Hot Springs Arkansas a lot of
[1:06:45] my parents family were was from
[1:06:49] there
[1:06:51] and so we we we were the meetings were
[1:06:55] out on a
[1:06:59] campground so I I talked to brother
[1:07:02] Billy
[1:07:03] paully Paul and I said if I give you my
[1:07:09] camera will you take some pictures of
[1:07:11] your
[1:07:13] daddy and he says yeah I
[1:07:16] will so he told
[1:07:19] me where to meet him after the service
[1:07:22] he pointed out a tree kind of far away
[1:07:25] from the
[1:07:31] building and you know after a service
[1:07:34] when they take brother Billy out to
[1:07:36] brother brandom out to the car people
[1:07:38] would just just start coming up and just
[1:07:41] flogging
[1:07:48] him and and you can imagine I mean if
[1:07:51] you had a baby that was just born and
[1:07:53] the doctor said it couldn't live you
[1:07:55] know you'd want to brother Brandon ple
[1:07:57] you know and
[1:07:58] people it was hard on him after he' had
[1:08:00] a long service but you you couldn't
[1:08:02] blame you know that's the way it was so
[1:08:04] brother bilot he said after he got his
[1:08:06] daddy in the car he just pointed a tree
[1:08:08] way back he says be standing back there
[1:08:10] I said
[1:08:22] okay yeah so when I saw brother brandham
[1:08:26] what was near the end of the surface I
[1:08:27] got up and went out and made my way back
[1:08:29] to that
[1:08:33] tree so in a few minutes here he he
[1:08:36] pulls
[1:08:39] up and I and I just want to say that um
[1:08:42] you know I was a Christian all my life I
[1:08:44] didn't really I wasn't did anything
[1:08:46] terribly
[1:08:52] bad but I was probably a little Retta
[1:08:54] you know what I'm sorry oh
[1:08:59] Retta you know when my dad wasn't look I
[1:09:02] tried to put a little bit of stuff on my
[1:09:05] eyelashes if he saw me he says get in
[1:09:07] there and was that face right now you
[1:09:10] know but I
[1:09:13] still so
[1:09:16] anyway
[1:09:17] brother brother Billy pulled up and and

[1:12:00] little funny stories
[1:12:05] and so Rebecca was there at that
[1:12:10] meeting and here she comes we get there
[1:12:12] early and she's coming up to me like

[1:12:52] yeah I said what does your Rebecca what
[1:12:55] does your daddy think about
[1:12:57] that she oh he loves
[1:13:00] him I'm like I don't get it you
[1:13:04] know of course he teased me later and
[1:13:07] said so you're concerned about Rebecca
[1:13:09] marrying a Baptist and you married an
[1:13:17] atheist I said no he was an
[1:13:22] no
[1:13:24] so then um you know time went on Mike
[1:13:29] and I got
[1:13:32] married and this is really really
[1:13:35] special to
[1:13:37] me I was expecting our first
[1:13:42] child I thought I was about a month away
[1:13:45] I was actually about two weeks
[1:13:50] away and we went to my husband and I
[1:13:53] went to a meeting at the Ramada where
[1:13:55] brother Brown
[1:13:58] was
[1:13:59] and the service was very long they held
[1:14:03] the service a long time before they even
[1:14:05] turned it over to brother brandham
[1:14:11] and and I was so tired and my back I had
[1:14:15] a place in my back that was really
[1:14:17] bothering
[1:14:22] me so I got up to stretch my legs and go
[1:14:26] out to the ladies room and just kind of
[1:14:28] move around a little
[1:14:34] bit and as I was going out I saw sister
[1:14:38] brandom brandom she was uh Sarah was I
[1:14:43] think about
[1:14:46] 14 Little Brother Joseph was there he
[1:14:48] was about
[1:14:50] nine and there was the seat next to her
[1:14:52] was empty and she kind of looked up at
[1:14:54] me and smile
[1:14:58] and so I went out I went on out to the
[1:15:02] restroom stretch you know relaxed a
[1:15:05] little bit then I came back in and I sat
[1:15:06] down by
[1:15:09] her and uh brother Billy like he he
[1:15:14] would get a seat he would go early he'd
[1:15:16] find a seat and save he'd find a spot
[1:15:19] where sister brandom and the children
[1:15:20] could sit where can you hear me all
[1:15:23] right
[1:15:27] they could get out to the car
[1:15:31] quickly so that not to delay him from
[1:15:37] leaving it was uh uh brother it was he
[1:15:41] was preaching broken
[1:15:45] sisters so when brother brandham was
[1:15:48] winding
[1:15:50] down sister brandham got got the
[1:15:53] children and went out to the car and I
[1:15:55] went with
[1:15:59] her so she sat in the front
[1:16:03] seat and little Sarah was right behind
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:08] her and little brother Joseph was in the
[1:16:11] middle then I was sitting there so
[1:16:14] sister Brandon and I were just visiting
[1:16:22] talking
[1:16:25] so
[1:16:26] I I I asked her I said later not now of
[1:16:32] course when you get home would you would
[1:16:35] you ask brother Brandon to remember me
[1:16:37] in
[1:16:41] prayer I've got a spot in on my back
[1:16:43] that's really bothering
[1:16:46] me and what I didn't
[1:16:49] know is that I was carrying the baby
[1:16:52] wrong
[1:16:57] the doctor was a little concerned I was
[1:16:59] very
[1:17:01] small he was concerned that I would have
[1:17:05] a little bit of
[1:17:07] problem I didn't know any that he didn't
[1:17:10] tell
[1:17:11] me that's probably what the pressure was
[1:17:16] from so I had asked sister Brown later
[1:17:19] you know when you get home later
[1:17:20] tomorrow what can you ask him to
[1:17:22] remember me
[1:17:27] she said yes so about that time I see a
[1:17:30] swirl of people and I I knew they were
[1:17:32] bringing brother brandom
[1:17:36] out so I got out of the car real
[1:17:40] quickly and walked around to the
[1:17:43] back and walked over and stood on the
[1:17:46] curb
[1:17:49] sidewalk and you then I just turned back
[1:17:52] to watch
[1:17:54] you couldn't turn your you couldn't walk
[1:17:56] away when he was
[1:18:00] around so I was just standing over on
[1:18:03] the
[1:18:05] sidewalk and I can I can see it right I
[1:18:08] mean I can see it today you
[1:18:10] know so he was looking out the window
[1:18:14] this
[1:18:15] way brother Billy was trying to get him
[1:18:17] in the
[1:18:18] car you know people running up brother
[1:18:21] BR and
[1:18:24] brother Billy was getting him
[1:18:26] in so he was he got in and sit down
[1:18:29] brother Billy was in his car
[1:18:32] his so he got in and sit
[1:18:36] down and then his head he
[1:18:40] went he just locked eyes with
[1:18:44] me I knew you know I mean just looking
[1:18:47] right at
[1:18:48] me and he through the wind you know
[1:18:51] through the wind he just went like that
[1:18:56] so I stepped off the curb and I walked
[1:18:58] around the front of the
[1:19:00] car and I came over to the
[1:19:04] side and he put his hand out the
[1:19:08] window right there
[1:19:11] know just said this soft simple
[1:19:18] prayer bowed his head and asked the Lord
[1:19:21] to be with me during delivery the
[1:19:26] baby and he just rolled up the window
[1:19:28] and drove
[1:19:32] away so I had her two weeks
[1:19:36] later and
[1:19:40] um
[1:19:43] well when I went into the delivery
[1:19:48] room the
[1:19:51] doctor when she
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:55] came he he said I don't know what
[1:19:58] happened in
[1:20:00] there I thought you were going to have I
[1:20:02] thought I was expecting you to have a
[1:20:04] problem and and the baby just came out I
[1:20:07] I don't know I don't know what
[1:20:12] happened and the nurse the nurse told me
[1:20:15] the same thing she's I've been on Labor
[1:20:16] and Delivery for four years and I've
[1:20:18] I've never seen that
[1:20:21] happen
[1:20:27] well I know what happened you
[1:20:31] know
[1:20:33] so when
[1:20:37] uh when Jana was about that was when she
[1:20:40] was about two weeks
[1:20:43] old my
[1:20:45] brothers and my
[1:20:47] dad I think the three of them maybe just
[1:20:50] Dawson that time I don't know they were
[1:20:51] they were going to go hunting with with
[1:20:52] brother
[1:20:56] brandom so brother brandom uh came to
[1:20:59] our
[1:21:01] house and and and and it's very close
[1:21:04] right here where at that time my dad
[1:21:06] owned a little trailer court right on
[1:21:08] Southern and 33rd Street I mean it's
[1:21:11] like yeah right up
[1:21:17] here I showed I showed brother Lis last
[1:21:21] night a couple little pictures that were
[1:21:23] made this day that I'm talking
[1:21:27] about sorry with my brothers
[1:21:31] and and
[1:21:32] him but he came in the
[1:21:36] house and it was odd that this happened
[1:21:39] this
[1:21:42] way my mother was in the
[1:21:46] kitchen and my dad and brothers were
[1:21:51] outside so it was just the two of us
[1:21:53] there in the living
[1:22:01] room
[1:22:04] and so he said the first thing he said
[1:22:08] or maybe not the first thing I just
[1:22:09] remember him
[1:22:13] saying he said Rebecca told me you had
[1:22:15] the
[1:22:17] baby but I don't remember her
[1:22:21] name he said it's sound like it seems
[1:22:23] like it was something Frenchy that's the
[1:22:25] word he
[1:22:28] used and I named her Janna
[1:22:32] Michelle J Michelle Michelle was after
[1:22:35] her daddy
[1:22:37] Michael that's the way he expressed
[1:22:41] it he said I think it was something
[1:22:45] Frenchy and I said I said Jan Michelle J
[1:22:49] Michelle and and we were just talking it
[1:22:52] was a little while that we were just in
[1:22:54] there alone
[1:22:58] together I wish I knew then what I knew
[1:23:04] now I didn't
[1:23:06] understand I'm going to back up a little
[1:23:08] bit my
[1:23:09] husband the guy that knew
[1:23:13] nothing and I'm raised in
[1:23:16] church and in brother Brandon's
[1:23:20] meetings and right after after we
[1:23:22] married when we started going to brother
[1:23:26] Outlaws I know you've heard brother
[1:23:28] brandham talk about the Mosley
[1:23:31] boys L them very
[1:23:35] much so these Mosley boys started asking
[1:23:38] my husband and I to go out and eat after
[1:23:40] service on
[1:23:44] Sunday talking to Mike
[1:23:48] about the prophet and the seventh Church
[1:23:52] age message
[1:23:55] messenger oh I don't know about
[1:23:58] this and my husband's eating it
[1:24:02] up seriously I was praying for him I
[1:24:05] thought oh Lord don't let him get mixed
[1:24:07] up in
[1:24:10] something I mean I loved him and I
[1:24:13] knew there was something different but I
[1:24:15] didn't know I didn't I didn't have that
[1:24:18] Revelation I didn't
[1:24:21] know
[1:24:23] isn't that that's kind of oddd you
[1:24:25] know so he got a hold of some
[1:24:32] tapes seven Church ages I
[1:24:35] believe so he gets this big recorder and
[1:24:38] this big real drill and he listens to
[1:24:40] one he puts it off he listens to another
[1:24:43] one no
[1:24:48] tomorrow I remember this is kind of
[1:24:50] personal I remember I'm falling asleep
[1:24:52] on on the
[1:24:53] couch how sleep how can you sleep listen
[1:24:57] to this how can you
[1:25:00] sleep Mike you've been listening for
[1:25:02] eight
[1:25:04] hours I can't hear it anymore I can't I
[1:25:07] can't think of I can't
[1:25:09] think you know so he CAU it I was right
[1:25:14] behind him I caught it pretty quick
[1:25:15] after
[1:25:20] that but I always thought that was Str
[1:25:22] strange that you know here I'm the one
[1:25:24] raised in church and see brother
[1:25:26] brandham as a little child and he it was
[1:25:28] all new to
[1:25:33] him but back to in the in that in that
[1:25:41] room he said something for years and
[1:25:45] years I thought
[1:25:49] it can I back up again
[1:25:53] I keep thinking I'm I think I have that
[1:25:54] on my NOS but I you know when when
[1:25:57] brother brandham um did like this and
[1:26:01] had me come to the
[1:26:05] car I knew that she had not told him I I
[1:26:10] could see you know I I know she never
[1:26:12] turned to him and said hey you know have
[1:26:15] I knew that hadn't happened and I
[1:26:18] thought you know he he you know can you
[1:26:21] imagine and he he must have seen Visions
[1:26:24] all the
[1:26:25] time he had to
[1:26:34] have you know he comes out of a long
[1:26:36] service
[1:26:38] and and he's trying to
[1:26:41] leave and you know to think that the
[1:26:43] Lord was mindful
[1:26:48] enough of that little need that I had
[1:26:53] to show the
[1:26:56] prophet I'm sure everybody there had
[1:26:58] their need was much greater than
[1:27:03] mine but so I I wanted to ask sister
[1:27:07] brandom did you tell him to pray for I I
[1:27:09] knew she hadn't but I kept thinking I'm
[1:27:12] going to ask her
[1:27:18] that and I never
[1:27:20] did but about 20 years later maybe I a
[1:27:24] long time
[1:27:26] later uh brother brother Billy and
[1:27:28] sister Lois were in
[1:27:31] Phoenix phoen they had driven from
[1:27:33] Flagstaff and were going back to
[1:27:37] Tucson and so the phone rang at the
[1:27:39] house and it was brother Billy and he
[1:27:41] asked Mike and I meet him for
[1:27:47] lunch Paul I ran out to the barn and
[1:27:49] said mik get in here and get a shower
[1:27:50] quick we got to go
[1:27:56] so we went to meet them and I told
[1:27:58] Brother Billy that story that day and I
[1:28:01] said I always wanted to ask your mother
[1:28:03] if she told Brother brandom about
[1:28:10] that and I said I never got I never got
[1:28:12] the chance to ask
[1:28:14] her and he said well I can tell you
[1:28:16] right now I already know the answer to
[1:28:18] that she didn't tell
[1:28:21] him
[1:28:23] we knew we did not talk to Daddy when
[1:28:26] you know when he first came out of a
[1:28:27] meeting and got in the car we didn't
[1:28:29] talk to
[1:28:33] him he was so you know in another
[1:28:38] realm and they just give him space of
[1:28:42] time until
[1:28:43] he came out of
[1:28:48] that so he told me he said I I no she
[1:28:56] didn't so then I maybe that's the last
[1:28:59] time I'll jump
[1:29:03] around back to it in the living room
[1:29:05] with us talking he said something that
[1:29:08] was so strange to me I didn't understand
[1:29:10] it for
[1:29:14] years well maybe I still don't
[1:29:17] but it was right after I he he asked me
[1:29:20] the baby's name you know said Frenchy it
[1:29:22] was something
[1:29:25] Frenchy and he said you
[1:29:28] know I I never liked my middle
[1:29:34] name he said I thought I always thought
[1:29:38] it was too
[1:29:40] girly or feminine you
[1:29:44] know I I struggle with this I I feel
[1:29:47] like I know he said the word
[1:29:50] girly
[1:29:54] but I think he also said feminine and I
[1:29:56] I worried about that for years I was
[1:29:58] afraid I'd get the I don't want to say
[1:30:00] anything wrong I mean I know that I know
[1:30:04] you know I'll face the Lord with
[1:30:05] everything I'm saying right
[1:30:11] here want anything to be a mistake
[1:30:13] that's what I worry about so much I
[1:30:15] don't want
[1:30:18] anything I ask the Lord to not let me
[1:30:21] you know stop me if I was going to say
[1:30:23] something that was
[1:30:27] wrong but he
[1:30:30] said he said I filled out a form one
[1:30:35] time a legal
[1:30:38] form and I didn't want to write Maran
[1:30:40] down so I wrote
[1:30:45] Marvin Marvin and that stuck in my mind
[1:30:50] forever
[1:30:53] and I I thought it was strange and I
[1:30:57] thought I didn't want to tell anybody
[1:31:00] about
[1:31:01] it because I never heard it on
[1:31:05] tape and you know no one's obligated to
[1:31:09] believe anything unless they hear it on
[1:31:14] tape but I knew he I knew he said
[1:31:17] that I mean there was not a question it
[1:31:20] was is just stamped in my
[1:31:24] brain that and and in my
[1:31:29] mind I
[1:31:31] thought that he was referring
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:35] to back in the day when a when a man
[1:31:38] turned 18 they had to sign up for the
[1:31:45] draft and that's in my mind that's what
[1:31:48] I thought it
[1:31:50] was
[1:31:54] but I never wanted to say
[1:31:57] that because I I wasn't
[1:32:00] sure I thought strongly it was something
[1:32:03] he said made me think
[1:32:06] that and I didn't tell anybody that
[1:32:08] about that for for years
[1:32:11] about telling me about writing Marvin in
[1:32:15] there and I was I was kind of afraid
[1:32:18] that people would find a way to
[1:32:22] criticize
[1:32:23] [Music]
[1:32:29] him in fact I told a cousin a niece of
[1:32:32] mine who's very good
[1:32:35] at like ancestry.com and stuff like
[1:32:46] that I said somewhere out there in cyber
[1:32:49] world is a farm that says say has Marvin
[1:32:52] on
[1:32:59] itom Marvin and I said if you ever if
[1:33:02] you ever find that I want to know cuz I
[1:33:04] know I know that's what he told
[1:33:12] me I told not hardly anybody about
[1:33:17] it and then
[1:33:19] about I tried to find that email today
[1:33:21] and I
[1:33:25] couldn't brother I asked brother
[1:33:28] Billy I told him about that I said
[1:33:31] brother Billy I haven't told Harley
[1:33:32] anybody about this
[1:33:33] because you know I never heard it on
[1:33:35] tape and I just kind of hated I said do
[1:33:38] you remember your
[1:33:40] dad using the name
[1:33:44] Marvin Marvin and he said well Sharon
[1:33:47] now that you brought it
[1:33:50] up I think I do remember daddy
[1:33:54] mentioning something about the word the
[1:33:56] name
[1:33:59] Marvin
[1:34:01] Marvin
[1:34:02] so brother Steve Robson and sister
[1:34:07] Danette they they left they were they
[1:34:10] were in Phoenix in two cars and they
[1:34:12] brother Steve had to go speak at a
[1:34:13] little church I think down in Mexico so
[1:34:15] they left one of their cars at my
[1:34:19] houseon Phoenix
[1:34:24] so the next day when they came back to
[1:34:26] get their
[1:34:27] car we were sitting down at the house
[1:34:29] for
[1:34:31] lunch and I told Brother Steve about
[1:34:35] this and he said Sharon Shar they
[1:34:38] they're using that they've already found
[1:34:41] that and they're using that they're you
[1:34:44] know those websites I don't touch them I
[1:34:46] Don't Go Near them I don't want anything
[1:34:47] to do with
[1:34:49] them they've already found that and
[1:34:51] they're they're using that you know like
[1:34:55] saying you know he lied about his name
[1:34:57] or something I don't you know name being
[1:34:59] Maran and I said are you kidding me
[1:35:03] and he said yeah it's all out there on
[1:35:05] the internet I said you're
[1:35:10] kidding wow so he sent
[1:35:13] me on my phone the the
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:19] form and I think Sister Sarah
[1:35:21] [Music]
[1:35:23] was at my house that night and we
[1:35:25] started getting on the
[1:35:28] Internet good I just about I wanted to
[1:35:31] ball it the form is selective Selective
[1:35:35] Service and it has a number there you
[1:35:37] know and it has his name it says William
[1:35:40] Marvin Johnson it has his mother's name
[1:35:42] Ella it has their address there in
[1:35:44] Jeffersonville and I I was staring at
[1:35:46] that I thought he told me about this in
[1:35:49] 1965 you know
[1:35:59] those people would not believe that
[1:36:00] anyway you
[1:36:03] know I can't explain it I don't
[1:36:06] know why but I I knew all those years
[1:36:10] that that was just like burned in my
[1:36:14] heart that just right there in that
[1:36:16] living room he told me
[1:36:18] that and here this surfaces
[1:36:22] years
[1:36:24] lat I don't know exactly you know what
[1:36:27] they're trying to make out of that and I
[1:36:29] don't
[1:36:32] care it's too
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:36] late nothing nothing satisfying but this
[1:36:39] to
[1:36:41] me so I think that's about all I I
[1:36:48] uh made it through this without fainting
[1:36:55] brother
[1:36:56] um Brother Louis just said something a
[1:36:59] while ago about Elijah was just like you
[1:37:02] know just a plain man
[1:37:06] and I was at I was at sister bram's
[1:37:09] house one
[1:37:11] day and I had
[1:37:14] a screaming
[1:37:19] headache um
[1:37:21] and my I didn't have anything I didn't
[1:37:23] have an aspirin or TI at
[1:37:26] all I thought I'm in the house of the
[1:37:29] Prophet I can't ask for an aspirin
[1:37:34] here what will they what will they think
[1:37:36] of me you
[1:37:37] know and my head was
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:41] pounding so finally I said
[1:37:45] rebeccaa any chance you guys you might
[1:37:49] have a Tylenol or an aspirin
[1:37:53] she goes to the kitchen and throws up a
[1:37:55] cupboard she says aspirin Tylenol you
[1:37:58] name it we've
[1:38:02] got so there you know he was a prophet
[1:38:05] but he was kind of you know could be a
[1:38:12] normal one other little thing is just
[1:38:16] popped in my mind
[1:38:17] is my brother Dawson was he was a hunter
[1:38:21] that's just about all he
[1:38:26] did he was a
[1:38:28] guide and mainly bear and
[1:38:33] lion and brother brandham he took
[1:38:35] brother I think I think that one of the
[1:38:37] little the little lion in the den down
[1:38:39] there was my brother helped him get
[1:38:47] that I shouldn't word it that way I he
[1:38:49] didn't need any help
[1:38:54] anyway um both my dad and both my
[1:38:57] brothers
[1:38:59] were Havalina
[1:39:04] hunting I'm so scared I'll get I don't
[1:39:07] want to get this wrong but I I believe
[1:39:08] Joe told me they were at
[1:39:14] sunset sunset so they had all been out
[1:39:16] hunting that
[1:39:18] day they came back into the camp
[1:39:22] and my brother Joe who was not he hunted
[1:39:26] but not quite on the level of
[1:39:32] Dawson so Joe said I saw something
[1:39:35] really strange
[1:39:39] today he said I think I saw an albino
[1:39:46] Havalina
[1:39:48] Alo and Dawson's like what
[1:39:55] what are you
[1:39:56] talking it's well I don't
[1:39:59] know was really
[1:40:03] weird and my dad and Dawson I think they
[1:40:05] said well it's probably the sun shining
[1:40:08] on and you know glancing off it looked
[1:40:10] it looked
[1:40:16] white they're kind of having this little
[1:40:18] talk together back and forth
[1:40:22] brother bram's just sitting there
[1:40:24] listening a few minutes he
[1:40:27] said yeah one lives right back over
[1:40:29] there behind that mountain
[1:40:32] range and Joe said that's exactly where
[1:40:35] he had
[1:40:37] been so that conversation
[1:40:41] stopped can you
[1:40:46] imagine he you know I think he said one
[1:40:49] time it was hard hard to tell when he
[1:40:51] was in a vision and he he just must have
[1:40:55] seen him all the
[1:41:02] time well I forgot something
[1:41:05] else that that day that
[1:41:10] um it was after we talked about the
[1:41:15] name and then brother brandom came back
[1:41:18] a few few days
[1:41:19] later
[1:41:21] to get his car and go
[1:41:23] home
[1:41:25] and my mother asked him to come in to
[1:41:30] eat and he says oh no sister Ry I'm All
[1:41:33] Dirty I'm you know my mother couldn't
[1:41:35] she didn't
[1:41:39] care oh please come on in and eat with
[1:41:43] us so he
[1:41:45] agreed and my mother was very plain she
[1:41:49] wasn't fancy she was just very plain
[1:41:55] simple but she was a good
[1:41:59] cook but she she just had a a pot of
[1:42:02] chili beans and some cornbread that's
[1:42:04] what supper was that
[1:42:10] night so they sat down to
[1:42:12] eat and my mother said brother Brom if
[1:42:15] ID known you were going to be here I
[1:42:17] would have fixed like a roast or
[1:42:18] something nice and this
[1:42:27] he said but sister Riley this is
[1:42:31] you so then she brought out a pecan
[1:42:37] pie my dad had to have a pie like almost
[1:42:40] every
[1:42:43] night so she gave him the slice of
[1:42:47] pie and he he took a bite he said sister
[1:42:51] Riley Riley that is the best pean pie I
[1:42:56] have ever
[1:42:58] had and then he had another bite or
[1:43:03] two and he looked at her he said now I
[1:43:06] didn't have to say
[1:43:09] that he was letting her know he really
[1:43:11] meant
[1:43:15] it so my dad you know he ran with that I
[1:43:19] my wife makes the best that's the word
[1:43:21] of a
[1:43:26] prophet so
[1:43:28] brother
[1:43:29] Octavio Octavio did I wreck that word
[1:43:33] yes that's fine my son-in-law Paul said
[1:43:35] I could call your brother
[1:43:39] o so he asked me well bring a couple of
[1:43:43] Pies
[1:43:45] so I don't know what in the world is
[1:43:48] going to maybe they ate him back there
[1:43:49] already but
[1:43:53] you Brothers eat those
[1:43:54] back I brought two
[1:43:57] pies and I know this this is kind of may
[1:44:01] seem crazy but they're they're made in
[1:44:04] the same pie plates that my mother made
[1:44:06] for
[1:44:10] him so they're back there I don't know
[1:44:13] what we're going to do with two
[1:44:16] pies they're there and those are the
[1:44:19] same plates that my mother
[1:44:25] Ser so I do think that's all thank

[1:52:33] ready we must trim our
[1:52:36] lamps you never know tonight might be
[1:52:38] our next
[1:52:41] night our sister said something very
[1:52:44] very
[1:52:45] special and she mentioned about brother
[1:52:48] brandom about his name
[1:52:51] all throughout the
[1:52:53] ages when God raised up his
[1:52:56] Prophet there's always been the
[1:52:59] contrary to try to go against God's
[1:53:03] Prophet it was Moses Then There Was
[1:53:06] Elijah they had their
[1:53:10] contrary then this day is no
[1:53:12] different there's Rosen many trying to
[1:53:15] go against the message of what
[1:53:18] brother
[1:53:20] rather but God sent the message to
[1:53:22] brother
[1:53:24] Bram and they've tried to make a little
[1:53:27] get the little mistakes brother BR said
[1:53:28] here and there
[1:53:31] here that document this that and the
[1:53:35] other God's
[1:53:37] Prophet makes no
[1:53:40] mistakes I'm going to say that again
[1:53:43] God's
[1:53:44] Prophet makes no
[1:53:48] mistakes in that letter it says William
[1:53:52] Marvin Branham William Marvin brandham
[1:53:55] and these
[1:53:56] group got that document and so you look
[1:54:00] there you see brother Bram he's a false
[1:54:03] prophet that is a government
[1:54:07] letter why would you lie to the
[1:54:10] government he put instead of putting
[1:54:12] Maran he put
[1:54:14] Marvin
[1:54:15] Marvin why did God allow brother Ram to
[1:54:18] do that
[1:54:20] if God allowed brother Bram to write it
[1:54:23] down that's more than
[1:54:27] enough and he told a sweet little
[1:54:31] sister that that leaves that lives in
[1:54:33] LaVine
[1:54:35] Arizona Arizona told
[1:54:37] her he said I put that I put that name
[1:54:43] down and those people see he's a false
[1:54:46] prophet and God is laughing at him
[1:54:49] saying I don't I don't make any
[1:54:51] mistakes I let him do it and so
[1:54:54] what God makes no
[1:54:57] mistakes I believe everything that
[1:54:59] brother Bram
[1:55:01] said we must believe everything that
[1:55:03] brother Bram
[1:55:04] said God's Prophet makes no
[1:55:08] mistakes how many you love the Lord won
