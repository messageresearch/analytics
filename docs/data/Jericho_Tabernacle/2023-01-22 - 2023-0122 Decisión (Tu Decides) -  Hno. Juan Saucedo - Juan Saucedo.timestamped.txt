[59:29] music
[59:32] when service is over we all went to eat
[59:35] somewhere
[59:36] and I went on to sister Lily Nicolas the
[59:40] wife of our brother Nick is
[59:45] and I extend my hand I said sister I
[59:47] just want to congratulate you is
[59:51] [Music]
[59:54] the music you were playing it was
[59:57] touching my heart all I could do was
[59:58] feel the presence of the Lord
[1:00:01] and she says brother Juanito I too was
[1:00:04] also here
[1:00:06] but I had my hands raised
[1:00:10] she wasn't playing the piano
[1:00:13] she had her hands raised
[1:00:18] my question is who was playing the piano
[1:00:25] many times we're going to here and we're
[1:00:27] going to feel and we're going to listen
[1:00:30] and I repeat again maybe not all hear it
[1:00:36] when the voice in the river Cameo
[1:00:39] brothers
[1:00:44] and suddenly they say You Heard a Voice
[1:00:47] see right is that so
[1:00:51] just as John the Baptist
[1:00:54] and what a thing
[1:00:57] baptizing in the Ohio River Los camos
[1:01:02] those that have gone there the Brethren
[1:01:04] have taken you there
[1:01:07] to the place more or less where they
[1:01:09] know that he was baptizing
[1:01:14] there's no doubt because you look up and
[1:01:16] somewhere they heard a voice
[1:01:21] this is John the Baptist was sent
[1:01:24] to forward my first coming
[1:01:27] your message
[1:01:47] heard it
[1:01:50] but not everyone heard it
[1:01:54] Brothers God knows what he's doing
[1:01:58] we thank God for that precious presence
[1:02:02] that the Sons and Daughters of God can
[1:02:05] feel
[1:02:08] this morning Brothers my message is
[1:02:10] titled decision
[1:02:15] I've been getting three messages
[1:02:22] and of the three I'm going to decide on
[1:02:24] one asking God for the leadership
[1:02:27] I cannot preach all three
[1:02:32] but God help me Lead Me Guide Me Lord
[1:02:36] and last Sunday
[1:02:39] after hearing all of you
[1:02:44] especially the brothers that came up
[1:02:46] here
[1:02:50] Brothers go back to listening to last
[1:02:53] Sunday's message
[1:02:55] many times a little detail goes over our
[1:02:57] head
[1:02:58] when we're here
[1:03:01] and I see everyone here
[1:03:05] but I don't know who's out in the Mexico
[1:03:08] City
[1:03:09] he was out in San Luis who's out in
[1:03:12] Nogales
[1:03:14] who's out in their kitchen right now
[1:03:19] I just hope that everyone's here this
[1:03:21] morning
[1:03:23] but forget about everything this morning
[1:03:27] let's put our concentration here this
[1:03:30] morning
[1:03:32] we want to live better than what we came
[1:03:35] isn't that everyone's desire Brothers
[1:03:40] to leave here better than what we came
[1:03:43] why not say it that way and with your
[1:03:46] health
[1:03:49] we will accomplish it
[1:03:52] says
[1:03:58] but I was admired by the brothers the
[1:04:00] brothers Octavio felt to put up here God
[1:04:04] blessed
[1:04:07] everyone did an exceptional job
[1:04:13] just just to show you Brothers I don't
[1:04:15] know if it went over your head or you
[1:04:16] caught it like
[1:04:18] I'm seeing my brother this morning
[1:04:22] in one of the
[1:04:25] and one of the first services that they
[1:04:27] had here
[1:04:29] [Music]
[1:04:31] Allegre happy and so joyful
[1:04:34] because finally
[1:04:37] they were already now in the church
[1:04:40] and we had a pastor immense
[1:04:44] and he mentioned his name brother Johnny
[1:04:46] Alvarado
[1:04:48] muchos may God grant us many services
[1:04:58] many many days
[1:05:01] but God has something here from all of
[1:05:04] us
[1:05:09] God had hid it from all of us
[1:05:14] that he was planning on picking up in
[1:05:17] his place our brother Johnny
[1:05:27] can anyone tell me this morning I knew
[1:05:29] it Brothers I don't believe it
[1:05:43] and this morning we want to thank God
[1:05:47] before he took up our pastor

[1:05:53] people
[1:05:55] these young preachers we have here

[1:06:17] greet them
[1:06:18] then I told Brother Johnny
[1:06:21] this young man
[1:06:24] I can see something tremendous in this
[1:06:26] man
[1:06:28] he's going to be of a lot of help for us
[1:06:32] and now he's the co-pastor of ours
[1:06:37] and back then we didn't know it Brothers

[1:13:56] and for me brothers that's a decision
[1:14:02] naomir got into a Strange Land is
[1:14:09] foreign
[1:14:14] and remember one thing brother Brandon
[1:14:16] would say God can't bless his people
[1:14:17] meanwhile they're far from their land
[1:14:20] the reason why Naomi is
[1:14:24] two sons they left there
[1:14:27] was because the Hunger Games
[1:14:35] and they heard that in the land of Moab
[1:14:37] there was food he said foreign
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:36] I don't know how many brothers and
[1:15:38] sisters that happens to you know cuantas
[1:15:40] is
[1:15:43] I don't know how many are alone today

[1:15:50] you're not alone
[1:16:00] if you're alone you live alone
[1:16:03] don't worry
[1:16:05] there's someone watching
[1:16:07] there's someone who will be with you
[1:16:12] every time there's service you're here
[1:16:15] to his name be the glory
[1:16:18] Brothers it was your decision
[1:16:23] it has us all here this morning
[1:16:26] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:16:29] those that have helped in construction
[1:16:33] even when they're at a meeting
[1:16:44] one of them
[1:16:47] that's what I like about this place
[1:16:50] that's what I like about brothers
[1:16:54] when he gives us the opportunity to
[1:16:56] speak
[1:16:57] if we're six they're at the table
[1:17:00] he gives the opportunity to all six
[1:17:04] to give our opinion
[1:17:06] and I'm thankful for that Brothers
[1:17:10] he doesn't make the decision all alone
[1:17:14] he gives the opportunity to give your
[1:17:17] opinion
[1:17:19] now there will be times where he's going
[1:17:21] to take the initiative
[1:17:26] there are times he's going to gather us
[1:17:28] and say Brothers we yeah
[1:17:30] [Music]
[1:17:39] well it sounded and I say unto our ears
[1:17:42] or maybe that's how I heard it
[1:17:48] we don't want to know who was it that
[1:17:50] was not in agreement
[1:17:54] but we see today that it was God's will
[1:17:57] respect
[1:17:59] and the other five respected that
[1:18:01] decision
[1:18:02] that's how it should be brothers
[1:18:08] that's why we're all here this morning
[1:18:10] in this place
[1:18:14] there was no money there was nothing
[1:18:20] that takes me into one of the messages
[1:18:22] of our brother Brandon
[1:18:56] it was like a lake there
[1:19:25] the desire of everyone was to build a
[1:19:27] place
[1:19:30] where they can worship and praise the
[1:19:32] Lord
[1:19:34] if we pass around the offering place
[1:19:38] if they'd raise 80 cents
[1:19:42] Brothers 80 cents that's how he says it
[1:19:46] 80 cents Brothers
[1:19:48] back then in the 30s
[1:19:56] Brothers if they would put 80 cents in
[1:19:58] the offering bin that was a lot
[1:20:00] can you imagine
[1:20:03] now you hear music
[1:20:07] looking for a place in a church
[1:20:12] to rent surely because we can't afford
[1:20:14] to buy but
[1:20:16] behind all of that is there was God
[1:20:50] the thing that surprises me most
[1:20:52] Brothers
[1:20:53] it's already paid
[1:20:56] so his name be the glory
[1:21:00] you know one thing I think God because
[1:21:03] of the pandemic
[1:21:06] because before we would lift up the
[1:21:09] offering bin right
[1:21:12] we pass around the offering Ben do you
[1:21:14] remember
[1:21:16] we did it here
[1:21:20] but then that sickness came
[1:21:24] and we place the boxes there in the
[1:21:27] front
[1:21:29] and I thank God for that this morning
[1:21:39] if you don't want to give anything you
[1:21:40] don't have to give anything
[1:21:43] but if you're a son and daughter of God
[1:21:45] and you know
[1:21:47] that you've been called if you say is
[1:21:54] every time you come to church
[1:21:57] you'll take your offering
[1:22:00] we don't know how much you put in there
[1:22:17] we don't have to sell little Mexican
[1:22:19] Goods
[1:22:25] I've got a son his name is Jonathan you
[1:22:27] know him
[1:22:29] he went to somewhere over here around
[1:22:32] this place
[1:22:34] and when service was over yeah
[1:22:37] someone invited him so he went
[1:22:45] service was over and they announced that
[1:22:47] they had food and all these things
[1:22:51] and my son Jonathan well you know it's
[1:22:54] like a fellowship
[1:22:55] he started to order and ask in order
[1:22:59] and then he got to a place where they
[1:23:01] asked him for the money
[1:23:04] and he was left kind of shocked like
[1:23:06] well don't they just give it to you
[1:23:08] Hermanos contenders
[1:23:14] aren't we happy that we haven't sold
[1:23:16] food here yes
[1:23:18] you know what I mean right Brothers
[1:23:21] we don't have to sell anything
[1:23:24] that was the vision of our brother
[1:23:26] Johnny Alvarado vision of our brothers
[1:23:30] and that should also be our vision
[1:23:36] nothing be sold here at church
[1:23:39] if God called us
[1:23:41] then he'll provide
[1:23:45] when God sends us to preach somewhere
[1:23:48] God gives us the finances to go there
[1:23:51] his name be the glory
[1:23:54] if there's someone happy it's me
[1:23:58] because oh how I sold grapefruits and
[1:24:01] oranges
[1:24:02] I used to do car washes
[1:24:07] I had a car wash on Seventh and another
[1:24:09] on Central
[1:24:11] and all the young people washing cars
[1:24:14] and all of them washing cars
[1:24:18] and packaging up uh grapefruits
[1:24:22] I had used there and there
[1:24:25] at the stop lights
[1:24:28] selling grapefruits for a dollar for a
[1:24:30] pack of grapefruits
[1:24:34] hermanosis
[1:24:37] and if there's someone that's happy that
[1:24:39] that doesn't exist it's me
[1:24:43] first of all we don't even have
[1:24:45] grapefruit trees
[1:24:47] car washes and we don't need any car
[1:24:49] washes yes God is
[1:24:53] the one Supply in everything
[1:24:55] to his name be the glory
[1:25:00] one dear brother Sosa who came up front

[1:25:05] brother Guzman Hermanos
[1:25:07] Brothers I'm so happy

[1:28:21] a type of the Bride
[1:28:26] when her mother-in-law said now Ruth
[1:28:28] would you return back

[1:28:33] leave with you

[1:29:39] God gives her all the right
[1:29:41] to say yes
[1:29:44] no or to say no
[1:29:49] yes I see is that so
[1:29:51] Americans
[1:29:53] if the young man goes and then gets uh
[1:29:56] bold enough
[1:29:57] and I struggle to get uh courageous
[1:30:01] first of all I don't even speak English
[1:30:04] she didn't speak Spanish
[1:30:15] I don't even know how I did it
[1:30:19] I don't know if it was English Spanish
[1:30:21] or something mixed
[1:30:23] but my wife is here
[1:30:26] foreign
[1:31:24] in elementary the government pays for
[1:31:27] everything
[1:31:28] for my little lunch they would pay for
[1:31:31] it
[1:31:33] a little piece of bread cut down the
[1:31:35] middle with a little butter
[1:31:39] and a little carton of chocolate milk or
[1:31:41] regular milk they would give it to us
[1:31:44] the government would pay for that
[1:31:47] but once I finish that yeah I couldn't
[1:31:50] continue
[1:31:52] we were a low-income people
[1:31:57] I wanted to study
[1:31:59] I really enjoyed studying
[1:32:02] especially history
[1:32:06] fascinates me Las mathematicas no math
[1:32:10] that was not my strong suit
[1:32:13] one day they put me there on the board
[1:32:18] in second grade they're on the board
[1:32:21] and the super
[1:32:24] and chose me
[1:32:27] imagine
[1:32:30] I didn't know
[1:32:32] I never paid attention to that is
[1:32:39] and they made me do this small little
[1:32:42] like little equation division
[1:32:46] put 34 right here and then do this
[1:32:52] and then put 10
[1:32:54] 580.
[1:32:56] that's yours now divided
[1:33:00] I'm there on the board and
[1:33:03] finally he said you know what just go
[1:33:05] ahead and sit down

[1:34:40] and the young people preached many a lot
[1:34:42] here
[1:34:45] the only man that did not choose was
[1:34:48] Adam

[1:34:56] Brothers we chose
[1:34:59] Nosotros

[1:46:24] I know I haven't been called
[1:46:29] and you know what happens to those that
[1:46:31] go to season without being called
[1:46:35] it's death
[1:46:39] just like the president of the United
[1:46:41] States is taking care of today
[1:46:45] I don't know how many saw the president
[1:46:47] of the United States
[1:46:49] when he went to Mexico City
[1:46:52] I don't know how many saw it or not but
[1:46:57] he was there and then the prime minister
[1:46:59] of Canada was there
[1:47:02] and the cars that escort him
[1:47:05] to their identical
[1:47:07] which one is
[1:47:10] we're standing there waving and
[1:47:14] once the president came to Denver
[1:47:16] Colorado

[1:49:28] this morning she went out and saw the
[1:49:30] king he said yes and if the king
[1:49:33] wouldn't extend his staff then it was
[1:49:36] death
[1:49:37] there was someone that can go to her
[1:49:41] but when the king saw her
[1:49:46] he extended his scepter
[1:49:48] and she came to him so his name be the
