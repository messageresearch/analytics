pastors left last wednesday and we're thankful that they let us know that we can pray for them and like brother floyd said on wednesday and those that have remained we're going to receive a double portion because we have a church we can go to hear the word of god we're going to be opening our scriptures book of daniel chapter 5 [Music] the sound system the musicians the losiaconos the deacons we want to thank you for being here [Music] daniel 5 27. [Music] in the balances and are found wanting approach your throne of mercy and grace [Music] lord may you be able to edit it [Music] [Music] we ask all these things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated amen this morning i would like to give a beginning to a series of messages something that the lord has placed in my heart and if god permits we would like to bring it in the coming months and i'd like to place the title on it and it's putting all things in balance so this morning we'd like to place the foundation we're going to travel very far should be able to are you ready to listen to the word of god this morning amen [Music] belthazar una fiesta and this king was having a a party and there was like a hand a finger riding on the wall but there was a woman that knew that there was a prophet on the on the earth and this king said if somebody can give me this instrument i'm going to give them a big gold chain daniela do you know what a scale is it's like a judge it has a it's like it's weighted that's why i placed the image there in in english i have one in english and one in spanish there's like a scale if you go to the left the right side's going to lift up if you go to the right side the left side is sides and we've got to keep them in balance you can't go to one side you can't go to the other side too much amen amen and as the months proceed we're going to enter in deeper into the mess for example the tires must have a certain amount of air pressure let's say one tire the car begins to force itself a little bit more i know have you heard of that when the tires are low in pressure the car has to work a little bit harder so that the car can drive down the road even amen equilibrium we're going to see what the word equilibrium means balance balance i'm sorry equilibrium an in an even distribution of weight enabling someone or something to remain upright and steady it's something for some someone or something to be able to stand upright and steady man but i'm afraid definition the second definition on a condition a condition in which different elements are equal or in the correct proportion now notice the third definition stability of one's mind or feelings this morning i'd like for you guys to study yourselves i can study you guys but how many of you have been able to study yourself establish are we stable in our minds in our feelings sometimes we're angry we're happy and then we're sad we should have stability in one's mind amen of balance so there's words that can take the place of the word balance steadiness stability harmony unity and orders those are words that can take the place of the word balance and i could say oh putting all things in steadiness but in all things instability putting all things in harmony putting all things in unity and putting all things in order man this morning we're going to place all things in its correct order there's a violence disorder disorder confusion confusion disconnection and disconnectedness can say man to that till now violence sometimes you feel disconnected you feel disconnected from your partner you feel disconnected from your children can't fit inside oh what is the fountain why doesn't amen amen depending [Music] all the scale what is the scale just like a judge has its scale there also god has a skill amen and it deserves a lot more attention than i will be able to give it and more than most any person on the earth would be able to give doctrine and to the brother who he may hear this tape offense i trust that it will not be an offense that's why sometimes we miss the target oh i see cccc yes yes yes yes yes study it prayerfully carefully don't proceed too quickly [Music] when something gets close to you in your daily life carefully and put in the balance of god's word [Applause] what does the word of god say or someone else so you could see this to see if it's of god or if it's are not given from or it's not the balance is the scale of the word the scale is the word the scale is the word because i believe that's how we should always be should always be this not every other year now give us one year next year a little wishy washy jesus that's why i believe it is [Applause] i believe that's the finished work of god wrote out in the word therefore or god's plan listen to each word the prophet is saying it couldn't be of god or could it be god's plan if it's not in amen amen i hope you remember the definitions we just gave equilibrium it's being in the balance in one moment or another have you ever felt some a little violent i see you but i want you to study yourself have you fought with god in one moment of your life or another in the book of acts that was peter with apostles i'm referring to acts chapter five pharisees for preaching and teaching the word of god they placed them in prison acts 5 chapter 19. the angel of the lord came and denied and preach the words of this life they went out and they obeyed and then when the day came the guards they saw that they weren't there anymore they grabbed them the council they bought them before the council for the captains and the pharisees so the pharisee stands up unfair one pharisee and verse 34. his name is gamaliel a doctor of the law is telling this to the pharisees and to the captains and he says now i say unto you leave him [Applause] is because man wants to go against isis and if they go against contra you're not fighting against men you are found fighting against god my question for you guys is have you guys thought have you become violent with god god help us this morning we fight because when god tells us something it's the perfect will amen are you awake this morning man this is right in his own eyes okay what i do it's right it's correct but the lord pondereth lost the hearts amen amen opinion all the ways that the man are clean in his own eyes in my opinion because the word says the word says i was correct in my opinion there's a spirit [Laughter] in in my is my opinion it's what the word says if you're out of the word and then you're out it doesn't matter what my opinion may be my opinion my opinion is out of the word and i am out of the word in several examples in the scripture is weighing there is a spirit and proverbs 16 2 it says the spirit especially one that is hidden or not obvious there's a reason because we know something or objective i like this definition here they say not influenced by personal feelings or opinions personally it says not influenced by personal judge feelings or opinions of other people what is our motive what is our objective when we're doing this it's the word of god and see if your motive is right and then test your motive and see if your motive is right then jesus said in mark 11 24. if you say to this mountain be moved and you don't doubt in your heart but as long as you have doubt in your heart whether it's the will of god or your motive or objective is wrong said prophet says how is it going to move i'm going to repeat it one more time but if your motive and your objective is wrong not with the he weighs the spirits proverbs a false balance and is an abomination to the lord abomination what's an abomination it's like going to a restroom sometimes the smell is a little harsh that's an abomination and the truth don't miss the definition of balance this is uh uneven disunity violence disorder confusion disconnection and disconnectedness if there's something false because there's something genuine so when we have everything in balance the lord is pleased when we have our time and the lord is pleased with us here in 1st samuel chapter 2. she didn't have a son for the lord is god of knowledge begin to worship god it says talk no more so exceedingly proudly and me and me and me let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the lord is god of all time and by him he knows everything god will remain in silence what are my actions what an says let us lay aside every weight what weight is dragging you this morning what weight do you get that's making you lean this morning what weight is in within inside of you and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us and the other thing is there's so that we may be the example for others placing your eyes on the pastor says looking unto jesus i don't want to go to church no more i that's why we see a lot of people on the wayside family because they see how they have their eyes placed on this on this family this ministry that ministers and what they do i follow amen it's not destruction to the wicked look how tremendous is it not destruction to the wicked and a strange punishment to the workers of and counts all my steps if i was walking is integrity what is job saying i was walking in the seat did i deceive the people did i do something wrong said god best of me said weigh me in the balance of justice i want to be judged it put me on the scale of the word and you shall know it says the scale of the word he sees my actions he knows if i lied quantus on me where my steps are if and god gave him a diet so he began to take some weight off so we're going to fall over to this side but when we're in the correct way we're in the correct rate with the word there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee [Music] i will not fail thee for this people shall divide for an inheritance of the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them see what is god saying here so that we can take care yeah [Music] so that we can be according to all the law which my most my servant moses has commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left are you following me it says observe to do the law says observe to do the law take care of it to in the world so that you may be able to prosper in all things so you may learn amen amen may prosper wherever that goes this morning we're only placing the foundation that was raised up in babylon amen amen do you guys remember that there was an image he raised up an image and the prophet said was of the prophet daniel daniel that was the beginning of the gentile dispensation there was three a massage they would not worship that image that was the image of a prophet there will be another and this is the and this is the writing was written also has a party they were having a party [Music] [Music] [Music] because amen amen let us pray [Music] we don't want to separate ourselves from the word from the left or the right we want to place all things in the balance [Music] [Music] in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] wisdom before they were [Music] no [Music] there's no way [Music]
