[1:16:47] to be up there but my name is Ulysses
[1:16:50] Acosta
[1:16:53] I'm sixteen years old I became I became
[1:16:58] very troubled as of recently because
[1:17:01] some events that happen last year which
[1:17:04] I will get into but firstly before I
[1:17:07] start I want to thank mother Johnny for
[1:17:09] the confidence for the trust
[1:17:12] fill me up here now that I'm up here
[1:17:14] it's really nerve-wracking it's pretty
[1:17:18] nervous I'm pretty nervous already as
[1:17:20] you can tell forgive me if I sound a
[1:17:22] little a little weird you know it's my
[1:17:25] first time up here I'm young so the
[1:17:31] scripture I want to talk about today is
[1:17:33] Philippians chapter 4 19 it's like a
[1:17:38] reflection of my testimony which I'm
[1:17:41] gonna be giving out today so it reads
[1:17:45] like this and my God shall supply all
[1:17:47] your need according to his riches and
[1:17:50] glory by Christ Jesus innovation and
[1:17:54] espanol tambien
[1:17:55] so Philippines's cuatro this another a
[1:17:59] second videos those parada the todo lo
[1:18:03] que necesitan conforme a la sclerosis
[1:18:05] recursos que tienen increased services I
[1:18:10] want to give a title to my testimony
[1:18:13] today it's like like I said it's a
[1:18:16] reflection of my testimony and it
[1:18:18] describes it pretty well
[1:18:19] and I want to give it the title hittin
[1:18:21] blessings or blessings in disguise
[1:18:23] because at the time I was I was very
[1:18:27] confused I didn't I didn't know what I
[1:18:30] was feeling or what I was going to
[1:18:32] happen I was going to be a blessing or
[1:18:34] not so I named it hidden blessings so I
[1:18:40] was about this happened around last year
[1:18:43] around me I just got out of school I got
[1:18:46] an out of school I was happy because I
[1:18:49] really don't like school and I think a
[1:18:51] lot of us don't so I just got out of
[1:18:56] school my parents my family were
[1:19:02] we're very um very confused because we
[1:19:06] moved out of my family my family that
[1:19:08] consists of my father my mother and my
[1:19:12] sister and me we had to move out of the
[1:19:15] house out of the house that we were
[1:19:16] living in after like something years but
[1:19:21] I don't really remember but we had to
[1:19:24] move out because of some inconveniences
[1:19:26] and it was also a good thing because it
[1:19:30] was a house in which we were living 10
[1:19:32] people brothers 10 people in one house
[1:19:34] with like four rooms that was it I had
[1:19:38] to share a room and it's been like that
[1:19:40] for my whole life for 15 years in my
[1:19:42] life I've been sharing a room with
[1:19:44] someone else and to some point it's good
[1:19:47] because you know you're with someone but
[1:19:50] it's also good to you don't have privacy
[1:19:52] right so we moved out of the house
[1:19:56] around mid-may we went to go move in
[1:19:58] with some family on my father's side so
[1:20:07] we had to move in with some family on my
[1:20:08] mother's side on my dad on my dad side
[1:20:10] and for about two months we stayed there
[1:20:13] it was pretty it's pretty difficult at
[1:20:16] first the first two months were pretty
[1:20:18] smooth it was it was just it was a
[1:20:21] smooth running from there I was pretty
[1:20:23] happy my birthday I passed which was in
[1:20:26] June the 23rd about three Sundays ago I
[1:20:29] think it was it was tough brother
[1:20:34] because around the end of July was when
[1:20:38] there was some very very discomforting
[1:20:41] things happen in the house and it's kind
[1:20:46] of hard to talk about because I can't
[1:20:48] really give that much detail but what I
[1:20:51] can say is that I was very I was very um
[1:20:55] I was very uncomfortable and it was very
[1:20:58] it was very bad for me on my spirit and
[1:21:00] in my in just my character overall and
[1:21:03] it was it was just hard for me and I can
[1:21:06] tell it was hard for my mother it was
[1:21:07] hard for my father and it was hard for
[1:21:09] my sister and it was hard for all of us
[1:21:11] because it was it was bad it was it was
[1:21:14] like betrayal your friends can betray
[1:21:17] you
[1:21:18] anyone else can betray you and it'll
[1:21:20] hurt but when your own family betrays
[1:21:22] you brother its it hurts a lot and it's
[1:21:25] bad it's really bad and I don't it's
[1:21:28] it's about to experience that and as a
[1:21:30] young kid I shouldn't be experienced in
[1:21:31] that I was around 15 and God provided
[1:21:37] brothers God really did provide it was
[1:21:40] around early August when we had to move
[1:21:44] out but we had to move out of the house
[1:21:46] when it was bad because we didn't well
[1:21:49] it wasn't really moving out it was more
[1:21:51] of being kicked out brothers we were
[1:21:53] being kicked out by our own blood
[1:21:55] our own flesh and blood brothers it was
[1:21:57] bad it was bad and if you've ever
[1:21:59] experienced that you know that it's not
[1:22:01] a good feeling at all and it's never a
[1:22:04] good feeling but early August we got
[1:22:10] kicked out we had to move everything but
[1:22:13] I don't move everything that we had we
[1:22:15] had to move it out we got to put it in
[1:22:17] the storage it was me and my dad and two
[1:22:20] other workers from u-haul that had to
[1:22:22] help put all of us stuff in two days
[1:22:24] brothers in the storage and it was
[1:22:27] packed it was like filled to the brim
[1:22:29] with just our stuff and we didn't know
[1:22:31] where to go and my father had told me
[1:22:34] that he that as a family we're just
[1:22:37] going to go somewhere you know live
[1:22:39] somewhere like under a bridge he said
[1:22:40] something like that and it was it was it
[1:22:44] was as bad but thankfully I thank God
[1:22:46] for my second family that consists of my
[1:22:50] aunts and my cousins I thank God for
[1:22:53] them because my aunts they're like a
[1:22:56] second mom to me and I'm really thankful
[1:22:58] for them and they provided they prepared
[1:23:01] a shelter for me and my family it was
[1:23:04] just they provide a shelter for my mom
[1:23:05] my sister and my dad and me not my dad
[1:23:08] because my dad it was a house full of
[1:23:10] full of women so he had to go live for a
[1:23:13] while with a brother but it was hard
[1:23:18] brother it was hard it was hard dealing
[1:23:19] with that it was hard feeling that too
[1:23:22] being betrayed you know it's a
[1:23:23] thrown out its it's just a bad feeling
[1:23:26] and at the time I didn't know how to
[1:23:30] feel I didn't know if it was a blessing
[1:23:33] I don't know if what to come was gonna
[1:23:35] be good
[1:23:36] all I knew that it was as bad right now
[1:23:38] and I just didn't like it but like I
[1:23:43] said God will provide he always will
[1:23:46] provide and it's just hard but time
[1:23:53] passed several weeks passed and we
[1:23:56] became we became more financially stable
[1:24:00] I guess you can say I I couldn't be
[1:24:02] working my mom can't work and my sister
[1:24:05] couldn't work so it was just my dad
[1:24:07] paying bills and it was bad it was bad I
[1:24:11] feel I felt I felt I felt really bad I
[1:24:13] felt worthless at times because I
[1:24:16] couldn't do anything to help him you
[1:24:18] know it was just really bad and I knew
[1:24:21] that what I was experiencing was was
[1:24:25] gonna be a gift from God only because my
[1:24:27] father for many years had told me that
[1:24:30] God will always provide on his own time
[1:24:33] and never on our time that we'll never
[1:24:35] be on our time brothers it will always
[1:24:37] be his and at times you may think that
[1:24:40] his timing is off God's timing is off
[1:24:43] and it's not but his timing will always
[1:24:45] be perfect
[1:24:46] he was always on time and he was on time
[1:24:49] this he was on time for us and he will
[1:24:51] be on time forever and for the years to
[1:24:54] come so little by little we were
[1:24:59] gathering the money we were gathering
[1:25:00] money to buy ourselves a house brother
[1:25:02] and it was to buy a house is hard it's
[1:25:04] hard but it's a lot of money it's a lot
[1:25:07] of commitment and it's a lot of strength
[1:25:09] and before I didn't think buying a house
[1:25:12] would be so hard but it was better it
[1:25:15] really was and it was even harder for my
[1:25:17] father to just pay the house alone on
[1:25:19] his he had a she had it like get
[1:25:22] everything out of his bank account it
[1:25:23] was like we're broke after that but
[1:25:26] thankfully God provided brothers and we
[1:25:28] got a house and it's crazy because
[1:25:33] we for we prayed many times and we gave
[1:25:37] God we ask God for specific things for
[1:25:40] our house I asked God myself in prayer
[1:25:44] to give us a house that was close to my
[1:25:46] school so I mom wouldn't have to drive
[1:25:49] me there I could just walk there
[1:25:52] it was also we needed a big house
[1:25:54] brother for a long time we've always
[1:25:55] wanted our house we've always wanted a
[1:25:57] big large house with a big backyard a
[1:26:00] big front yard and that's exactly what
[1:26:02] we got
[1:26:03] thank God for that it was my house is
[1:26:08] dirty like right next to my school so I
[1:26:10] could just walk there it's great it's a
[1:26:13] good house and I thank God for that
[1:26:14] and it's a date and we got our house
[1:26:18] August 24th and it's a date that I will
[1:26:21] never ever ever forget for the rest of
[1:26:24] my life because God changed my
[1:26:28] perspective on everything after that
[1:26:30] gave me faith gave me courage gave me
[1:26:34] many things and I'm so thankful for that
[1:26:37] I'm thankful for my father for my mother
[1:26:40] for always providing for me I've always
[1:26:42] providing for my sister and never losing
[1:26:45] hope because if they lose hope we lose
[1:26:48] hope brothers and we should never do
[1:26:51] that we should never experience that so
[1:26:54] we got our house as soon as we got our
[1:26:57] house we called brother Johnny to come
[1:26:59] pray for it that was our first priority
[1:27:01] because we needed to bless the house
[1:27:03] really like it was it was like it's a
[1:27:05] gift from God and what we should always
[1:27:06] do is bless it first and foremost we
[1:27:09] should always bless what God gives us
[1:27:11] and the journey to getting our house was
[1:27:16] finally over it was it was a good
[1:27:18] experience
[1:27:18] but also one that I learned a lot from
[1:27:22] it was crazy because our aging our aging
[1:27:25] for our house was a friends of a friend
[1:27:29] of my dad which he knew for a very very
[1:27:31] long time her name is Pamela sister
[1:27:33] Pamela Vega some of you may know her
[1:27:37] already
[1:27:37] but she was our aging for our house and
[1:27:41] as soon as we saw our new house we were
[1:27:43] driving by
[1:27:44] my dad's my mother said oh don't you
[1:27:46] know this this sister this and that and
[1:27:48] my father said yes
[1:27:50] then things happen we called her we gave
[1:27:52] her a call and we had to meet but we met
[1:27:55] with her at the house brothers and it
[1:27:58] was crazy because she said her very
[1:28:01] words were if you want this house I'll
[1:28:04] give it to you right now just tell me I
[1:28:06] could say it wasn't even on the market
[1:28:08] yet brothers but that's that's how good
[1:28:10] god is it wasn't even on the market
[1:28:12] Phil's on the market it would have been
[1:28:13] sold in very very little days possibly
[1:28:17] in just a day it's a very good house and
[1:28:20] it met all of our needs so my father
[1:28:24] obviously he said yes and we got the
[1:28:26] house brother after a very very long
[1:28:28] time a few months of planning preparing
[1:28:30] we got our new house and I'm just so
[1:28:34] grateful for that I'm grateful for God
[1:28:35] I'm grateful for everyone here listening
[1:28:39] to this testimony because I'm already so
[1:28:43] nervous and I just wanted to share a
[1:28:47] little bit of what God has done in my
[1:28:49] life and what God has done in my
[1:28:50] father's life and my my mom's life and
[1:28:53] my sister's life always together we
[1:28:55] share this testimony it's not only just
[1:28:57] me it's all of us and I think we all
[1:29:00] share the common feeling that God will
[1:29:03] provide and it's in the end the end or
[1:29:06] in the worst case scenario God will
[1:29:08] always provide and it's it's just now
[1:29:14] it's almost a year it's oh it's gonna be
[1:29:16] hearing on August 24th since we got our
[1:29:18] house and ever since that day we've been
[1:29:22] living good we've been we broke but you
[1:29:25] know we're still living you know and
[1:29:27] we're slowly we're slowly becoming more
[1:29:30] financially stable I guess you could say
[1:29:32] I'm 16 now so I can get a job I'm
[1:29:36] actively looking for jobs so pray for me
[1:29:38] please so I can talking out my father
[1:29:40] out because that's one of my dreams it's
[1:29:43] helped my father and also my mother pray
[1:29:50] for my mother as well because soon she
[1:29:52] will get her papers and she'll be able
[1:29:54] to work as well
[1:29:56] just pray for her please also our family
[1:30:03] we share a lot of common emotions we've
[1:30:06] we felt the past year we felt torment we
[1:30:13] felt bad worthless even because nobody
[1:30:18] wanted us where would we go we had
[1:30:22] nowhere but like I said God provided God
[1:30:26] helped us and it's something that I will
[1:30:29] never ever forget in my life it's it's
[1:30:32] it's a monument it's a milestone in my
[1:30:34] life from which I will always be
[1:30:36] grateful but I chose to to name this
[1:30:41] little testimony blessings in disguise
[1:30:43] because this was a blessing in disguise
[1:30:47] I didn't know that this was going to be
[1:30:49] a blessing I didn't know that this would
[1:30:51] change my life forever I didn't know any
[1:30:54] of this I just thought it's something I
[1:30:56] had to deal with alone like all the
[1:30:58] other times but no this time I was not
[1:31:02] alone out of God and I had my family
[1:31:04] with me and yeah I just want to I just
[1:31:11] want to give thanks to all of you for
[1:31:14] being here I didn't know I was gonna be
[1:31:15] so full I kind of wish it wasn't so full
[1:31:17] but when brother Johnny called me to
[1:31:20] talk here I was really nervous because
[1:31:22] it was my first time being called on the
[1:31:24] phone by by a pastor or with anyone with
[1:31:27] authority you know I saw I felt kind of
[1:31:29] special but I was also really nervous
[1:31:32] because it was my first time talking in
[1:31:34] front of so many people and I'm thankful
[1:31:37] and even though I I grew up looking at
[1:31:39] all of your faces it's still pretty
[1:31:41] nervous to me you know and I just want
[1:31:45] to I just wanna give thanks and this
[1:31:48] altar right here has been used well an
[1:31:51] altar in general has been used by many
[1:31:53] many people and I think that should be
[1:31:56] used only to serve God and only to give
[1:32:00] grace to God many people use this altar
[1:32:03] as a popularity contest and it shouldn't
[1:32:07] be like that
[1:32:08] ever we should use this only to serve
[1:32:11] God and the grace of God in us but to
[1:32:18] end I want to give I want to say
[1:32:21] something that and I was reading a book
[1:32:24] on in my in my English class in high
[1:32:28] school and in the book it said power and
[1:32:33] authority is nothing if not guided by
[1:32:35] love and I think that's very true if if
[1:32:40] you have power and you don't use it
[1:32:41] right if you have authority and you
[1:32:43] don't use it right it will turn out bad
[1:32:44] and it will turn out exactly the way it
[1:32:46] turned out in the past which we have all
[1:32:49] experienced and I think that's important
[1:32:52] too to touch on but I think I don't know
[1:32:58] if my time is up but like I said I want
[1:33:01] to give thanks to all of you for having
[1:33:03] me up here for having the confidence or
[1:33:05] for not making me so nervous but thank
[1:33:12] you thank you for listening
[1:33:13] I hope this touches one of your guys's
[1:33:16] hearts at least it'll be worth it
[1:33:18] everything is worth about but thank you
[1:33:21] god bless you
[1:33:23] [Applause]
[1:33:45] god bless thee brothers and sisters we
[1:33:48] saw in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:50] it's a honor and privilege to be here
[1:33:53] with you all this morning or this
[1:33:55] afternoon we just want to thank brother
[1:33:57] Johnny for the invitation having me here
[1:33:59] and special thanks to brother Michael
[1:34:02] Rodriguez and his wife for their
[1:34:04] hospitality and having me in their home
[1:34:06] as you all heard we've been able to
[1:34:08] establish somewhat of a really close
[1:34:11] relationship I'd like to ask you all
[1:34:14] please stand just want to read one
[1:34:15] scripture briefly I'm going to turn to
[1:34:21] the book of Romans chapter 6 verse 23
[1:34:28] Romans 6:23 reads for the wages of sin
[1:34:33] is death but the gift of God but the
[1:34:37] gift of God is eternal life through
[1:34:39] Jesus Christ our Lord you may be seated
[1:34:42] God add the blessings to his word I
[1:34:47] don't know about the young people here
[1:34:50] this afternoon but when you hear a
[1:34:52] testimony like brother Michaels hear a
[1:34:55] testimony like brother Lisa's I don't
[1:34:57] know
[1:34:57] how much attention you pay to something
[1:34:59] like that to be able to compare two
[1:35:03] extremes something that seems so simple
[1:35:06] as losing a house or being left homeless
[1:35:09] to a home wrecked house where a wife is
[1:35:13] crying for help and needing of the Lord
[1:35:16] each and every day for years and years
[1:35:18] and years but those simple testimonies
[1:35:21] those tremendous testimonies those are
[1:35:23] all just examples of the God that we
[1:35:25] serve the God of this day and as I
[1:35:29] reflect back on my youth my childhood
[1:35:31] I'm only 30 years old I think to myself
[1:35:34] we read so many times it's the God of
[1:35:37] our fathers and the God of our fathers
[1:35:39] and even in today those of us that have
[1:35:42] Christian parents to speak and we think
[1:35:44] of it in a way of the God of my father
[1:35:46] the god of my mother but I'm just here
[1:35:48] to let the young people know that that
[1:35:50] same God can be your God today you just
[1:35:53] have to open up you just have to be
[1:35:55] honest make that connection and that
[1:35:57] faith will make that good
[1:35:58] with God it doesn't have to be a God of
[1:36:01] history it's a God of today just for you
[1:36:05] for those of you the young people that
[1:36:07] don't know me my name is Marcos Isaiah
[1:36:10] Santana me my sister and my wife we come
[1:36:13] from San Diego California and maybe most
[1:36:18] of the elders or the older brother and
[1:36:22] sisters here might know my parents were
[1:36:24] there Mario Santana and sister Patricia
[1:36:26] Santana no like you young people here I
[1:36:31] was born in a message home in a
[1:36:33] Christian home I was dedicated just like
[1:36:36] the dedication I was performed today I
[1:36:38] was in a Christian home to the age of 18
[1:36:40] all I knew was church on Sunday church
[1:36:43] on Wednesday an extremely strict father
[1:36:46] that just had a vice grip on us ever
[1:36:48] since we were young a father that would
[1:36:51] take the time to look at the children
[1:36:53] that were in the church and see which
[1:36:55] ones were those bad kids those those
[1:36:58] traversals like they say and just try
[1:37:01] and withstand and keep his grips as best
[1:37:03] as he could from the enemy to grabbing
[1:37:05] hold of me and it was no exception with
[1:37:08] me and my sister you know growing up
[1:37:10] because my father came from a worldly
[1:37:13] life he knew what Satan was capable of
[1:37:16] and I don't know how many adults here
[1:37:18] how many parents here come from being
[1:37:21] born in non-christian home being born in
[1:37:23] the world but if you have or if that's
[1:37:26] your parents and you've talked to them
[1:37:28] and you get sincere and try and open
[1:37:30] their heart they'll let you know what a
[1:37:32] difference it is to grow up in a
[1:37:34] Christian home to grow up in the world
[1:37:37] and that's one of the things that my
[1:37:40] father always tells us you know how
[1:37:43] privileged you are how privileged we all
[1:37:46] are to be here in a Christian
[1:37:51] environment and now that I look I've
[1:37:53] been a Christian for eight years and
[1:37:55] within those eight years now I'm
[1:37:57] beginning to understand that even though
[1:38:00] we're within that fence that circle of
[1:38:02] protection were still born in this flesh
[1:38:05] and I don't blame any one of the young
[1:38:08] people here that feel as though there's
[1:38:10] that pole in that that
[1:38:11] yanking towards the world but you have
[1:38:14] an advantage over those that were born
[1:38:16] in the world that they didn't know that
[1:38:18] there's a door to salvation
[1:38:19] that they didn't know there's a keys to
[1:38:22] a Holy Spirit that can transform you and
[1:38:24] give you a new birth but here we are
[1:38:26] service after service after service not
[1:38:30] taking the opportunity all the while God
[1:38:33] is calling and calling and calling and
[1:38:36] today is not the exception
[1:38:38] you heard brother Michael the life did
[1:38:40] he live all the things that he went
[1:38:42] through the torture that he put his wife
[1:38:44] through if I could only put my mind on
[1:38:47] you young people to see these last few
[1:38:49] months that we spent with him to see
[1:38:54] such pain in a house but to see a
[1:38:59] virtuous woman that can stay strong for
[1:39:01] God they can hold to a promise and to
[1:39:05] see that life-changing power that God
[1:39:08] can do you know we were able to witness
[1:39:10] that firsthand for these last couple of
[1:39:13] months and young people that's the same
[1:39:15] God that can change you here today
[1:39:17] no like I said I grew up in a Christian
[1:39:20] home waiting until the age of 18 to let
[1:39:24] go get out of here I'm free I can go
[1:39:27] there's no need none of this you guys I
[1:39:30] said mom like maybe some of you all are
[1:39:35] today anxious being here in church you
[1:39:39] got a nice tie on you've got some good
[1:39:41] shoes on the sisters might not have
[1:39:43] their makeup on today they might be
[1:39:45] dressing in their nice dresses and
[1:39:47] things I was the best of those that
[1:39:50] could pretend to be a Christian in
[1:39:51] church with such a strict father they
[1:39:54] knew so much of the world they knew if I
[1:39:56] was even scratching at the surface of
[1:39:58] the grips of Satan he'd put a hold on me
[1:40:00] at that point it was so difficult
[1:40:03] growing up with him but at the age of 18
[1:40:05] I let it all go
[1:40:07] issues with the local assembly problems
[1:40:10] in the house
[1:40:11] all the demons that I'm bringing to the
[1:40:13] home I saw the perfect outlet to leave
[1:40:15] my house I don't want to get into too
[1:40:18] many details and explain these were
[1:40:20] limited by time but
[1:40:22] well anything you could imagine I
[1:40:24] probably did you know I got wrapped up
[1:40:26] in drugs I got wrapped up with women I
[1:40:29] was bars and clubbing and went to jail I
[1:40:33] had a child
[1:40:34] anything and everything out there maybe
[1:40:36] not the worst of the worst but this
[1:40:39] isn't a purpose to be able to show you
[1:40:41] or have you see I need to get lost I've
[1:40:46] got to go out into the world I've got a
[1:40:48] taste of this sin that the world has to
[1:40:51] offer me know these services these youth
[1:40:54] services that this assembly puts on for
[1:40:56] you young people it's for you to see
[1:40:58] that you don't have to go out into the
[1:41:00] world that there's nothing out there for
[1:41:02] you
[1:41:03] that no matter what you do out there
[1:41:04] it's only gonna get worse and worse and
[1:41:07] worse and I use the example all the time
[1:41:10] whoever's written on an airplane when
[1:41:12] you take off from the airport you start
[1:41:15] to find there's my house and there's my
[1:41:18] high school and oh there's the church
[1:41:20] and as you get further and further now
[1:41:22] it just turns into a gridded you get
[1:41:24] further further then you break the
[1:41:25] clouds and there's nothing you can see
[1:41:27] and that's the point that Satan wants to
[1:41:29] get you towards where you're so far it
[1:41:33] seems as though this don't looking back
[1:41:35] no looking back at all that's the point
[1:41:39] where say it had me years of not being
[1:41:42] at home years of not going to service I
[1:41:46] had a point where I just had this
[1:41:49] disgust and hatred toward my father and
[1:41:51] no love toward my family my sister my
[1:41:54] mother and in that type of a condition
[1:41:57] is where I found my wife and now I fell
[1:42:02] in love with that woman sister Lisa
[1:42:05] but at that time I didn't fall in love
[1:42:08] with that woman that you see there this
[1:42:11] old-fashioned dress long-haired wearing
[1:42:14] decent speaking person I fell in love
[1:42:18] with a horrible person that satisfied
[1:42:21] the lust of my flesh all the things that
[1:42:24] I wanted that I was trying to run away
[1:42:26] from to be able to grab hold up and just
[1:42:28] fulfill all of my desires a woman there
[1:42:31] were short dresses a woman that exposed
[1:42:33] her body I was her barber I would say
[1:42:36] half of her head and put designs in her
[1:42:37] head all these things perverted things
[1:42:40] that just keep growing in you they keep
[1:42:42] growing in you and keep growing in you
[1:42:44] till you can't look back a woman that
[1:42:47] was addicted to alcohol and gambling at
[1:42:49] a point if you ever get a chance to
[1:42:51] speak to her she knew no more outlet and
[1:42:54] she comes from a home that was half half
[1:42:57] Catholic and half Buddhist and one thing
[1:43:00] my father would always ask me the few
[1:43:02] times to move his feet would say mijo
[1:43:05] don't you ever tell your girlfriend's
[1:43:08] that you're a Christian or don't you
[1:43:10] ever tell them that you come from a
[1:43:12] Christian family that's the last thing
[1:43:14] that I wanted to hear and that's the
[1:43:16] last thing I wanted them to know is that
[1:43:17] I even have an ounce of anything
[1:43:19] Christian in me because I wanted to get
[1:43:21] as far away as possible and I felt as
[1:43:24] though I had found that with that woman
[1:43:26] right there you know it sometimes it can
[1:43:29] be funny how God works and now I
[1:43:31] understand when they say God works in
[1:43:33] mysterious ways it's because that is
[1:43:36] nothing but the truth
[1:43:37] God works in mysterious ways that you
[1:43:40] can't even imagine I got to a point
[1:43:44] where our relationship was in shambles
[1:43:46] we were hanging on to the edge and my
[1:43:49] father called me one day asking me and
[1:43:51] almost begging me using the excuse to
[1:43:54] come to church because it was my
[1:43:56] mother's birthday and he touched my
[1:43:59] feelings just enough to the point where
[1:44:00] I accept it and now he asked me and told
[1:44:04] me we know that you've got this
[1:44:05] girlfriend you know we've seen her we've
[1:44:07] heard about her but it doesn't matter
[1:44:10] why don't you just bring her too you
[1:44:11] know it's okay and I understand him now
[1:44:13] because he knows faith cometh by hearing
[1:44:16] and hearing the Word of God if you're
[1:44:19] not at least here to hear it once then
[1:44:22] how can God perform that job in you and
[1:44:24] I believe that's why each and every one
[1:44:26] of you young people made the decision to
[1:44:28] be here this Sunday morning for this
[1:44:30] youth service as opposed to being out
[1:44:32] there playing video games hanging out
[1:44:35] with your friends hanging out with the
[1:44:37] boyfriend or girlfriend but you chose to
[1:44:40] be here God brought you here today
[1:44:43] God had an appointment for that woman on
[1:44:46] that Sunday and it was not an
[1:44:49] appointment for
[1:44:49] me but when I told her she accepted to
[1:44:52] go but come Sunday morning
[1:44:54] I regretted everything about that
[1:44:57] decision I called her in the morning and
[1:45:00] all I could think about was how can I
[1:45:03] bring this woman who I called my
[1:45:06] girlfriend to church who is the perfect
[1:45:08] description of what our prophet tells us
[1:45:11] is a prostitute
[1:45:12] from head to toe am I gonna disgrace the
[1:45:15] family am I gonna embarrass myself in
[1:45:17] church am I gonna look bad before the
[1:45:19] church members all these things and it's
[1:45:22] constantly saying just working in your
[1:45:24] mind and working in your mind and
[1:45:26] working in your mind just to say don't
[1:45:29] go don't go don't go I called her I
[1:45:33] asked her to wear the longest dress that
[1:45:36] she had that morning I asked you to
[1:45:38] please don't wear any makeup that
[1:45:39] morning said you know those earrings
[1:45:42] that you wear those big huge gold
[1:45:44] earrings can you please don't take put
[1:45:46] those on or maybe just wear a tiny
[1:45:47] little one please and your hair
[1:45:50] please comb your hair over to the side
[1:45:52] so they don't see that you shave your
[1:45:54] head that was the end of it young people
[1:45:56] fighting cursing arguing you name it and
[1:46:01] you could imagine just the atmosphere in
[1:46:04] the spirit that we arrived a service
[1:46:05] that Sunday morning not ready to hear
[1:46:07] the word not ready to receive of God
[1:46:10] with a wrathful spirit one towards the
[1:46:12] other but when God has an appointment
[1:46:15] he's going to meet that appointment it's
[1:46:19] your responsibility to answer to that
[1:46:22] call are you going to accept or are you
[1:46:25] going to reject that call that morning
[1:46:28] the preacher was my father he was asked
[1:46:31] last minute to preach didn't have much
[1:46:33] prepared and he spoke on a simple sermon
[1:46:37] of forgiveness I've been my father's
[1:46:40] cameraman on his missionary trips for
[1:46:42] many years and I've seen the tremendous
[1:46:45] services the altar calls the people
[1:46:48] Folly now the massive prayers anything
[1:46:51] you could imagine but this Sunday
[1:46:54] morning by the time he was done
[1:46:56] preaching and I had my wife who was my
[1:46:59] girlfriend at the time
[1:47:00] on the side she was in tears bawling
[1:47:03] crying boogers like brother Mike says
[1:47:06] and I confess to you young people this
[1:47:08] morning this afternoon that was the most
[1:47:11] boring basic short message I ever heard
[1:47:15] my father preach there was no preaching
[1:47:17] on repentance there was no altar call
[1:47:20] there was nothing impactful on that but
[1:47:23] that's how God works it's God in
[1:47:25] simplicity if he's pulling on your heart
[1:47:29] today answer to that pull just be honest
[1:47:33] with him and surrender yourself with him
[1:47:35] my wife didn't know at that time what
[1:47:37] was going on like I said she come from a
[1:47:40] half Buddhist and a fake Catholic home
[1:47:42] that only goes to services on Christmas
[1:47:44] and Easter had no notion of what a God
[1:47:47] is who is this Jesus Christ what is this
[1:47:50] holy spirit not even not thought of a
[1:47:52] new birth nothing if you ever get the
[1:47:55] chance to speak to her she'll tell you
[1:47:57] how at that moment during those tears
[1:47:59] she felt as though she was getting
[1:48:01] lifted out the building to where she had
[1:48:03] to hold on to the chair so she wouldn't
[1:48:05] fly out of the room and as she come down
[1:48:08] a fire burning within her and these
[1:48:11] things just being sucked out of her and
[1:48:13] the sweet presence being deposited
[1:48:16] within her and she knew nothing of what
[1:48:19] was going on but she felt it and that's
[1:48:21] why you need a supernatural experience
[1:48:23] with the Lord
[1:48:25] something that you can't explain
[1:48:27] something that people won't even believe
[1:48:29] but it's made just for you a
[1:48:32] supernatural personal experience of God
[1:48:35] just for you that day she went home she
[1:48:41] threw away makeup she threw away pants
[1:48:44] miniskirts earrings music all of these
[1:48:48] things to the point where she ended up
[1:48:49] fighting with her own mother and her own
[1:48:51] sister because they thought she was
[1:48:52] crazy I asked you young people if
[1:48:56] nothing was preached on how a Christian
[1:48:59] woman should dress how a Christian
[1:49:01] should act on how you should compose
[1:49:03] yourself on what is the difference
[1:49:05] between sin and a Christian life what
[1:49:07] told her to get rid of all those things
[1:49:10] what could have told her nothing
[1:49:13] more than the power of the holy spirit
[1:49:15] speaking to her heart she changed
[1:49:18] everything she went and asked to speak
[1:49:21] with my father I made the arrangements a
[1:49:23] day or so later I was confused all I
[1:49:26] knew was something had happened because
[1:49:29] she wouldn't talk to me
[1:49:30] she wouldn't touch me she wouldn't let
[1:49:32] me hug her that evening when we met with
[1:49:35] my father in the home my father took her
[1:49:37] from Genesis to Revelation from serpents
[1:49:40] II to the revelation of Jesus Christ and
[1:49:43] what was so incredible is a person who
[1:49:45] has no knowledge of this precious
[1:49:48] message that you young people have was
[1:49:51] receiving one after the other after the
[1:49:54] other
[1:49:54] accepting back and forth to the point
[1:49:57] where he grabbed her by the hands and
[1:49:58] asked her said what do you want me care
[1:50:01] what do you desire she looked at him in
[1:50:04] the face as she goes I just want to
[1:50:06] serve God with all of my heart that was
[1:50:09] a bomb before my face now I know now
[1:50:13] that I can see the difference when a man
[1:50:15] is surrendered to God and when he can
[1:50:17] separate matters of the flesh and blood
[1:50:20] for matters for Jesus Christ and the
[1:50:22] soul for him he turned around and he
[1:50:24] looks right at me and says and if he
[1:50:27] doesn't want to walk with God you need
[1:50:30] to keep on going forward there was a
[1:50:32] blow to my heart so strong it was a
[1:50:34] light bulb switch that turned on in my
[1:50:36] life to think what is going on here like
[1:50:40] I told you before I fell in love with
[1:50:43] the old woman not that one that you see
[1:50:45] right there but I had enough upbringing
[1:50:48] enough knowledge enough teaching to know
[1:50:51] something was going on with that woman
[1:50:53] she put a list of restrictions on me
[1:50:56] that was so long no more intimacy no
[1:51:00] more hugging no more kissing no more
[1:51:02] drinking no more smoking I didn't care I
[1:51:04] changed everything for the love of that
[1:51:08] woman what I'm here to tell you as well
[1:51:10] young people no matter what you do to
[1:51:13] look right in church to song lead to
[1:51:16] interpret to play instruments whatever
[1:51:19] it is if it's by your own good merits
[1:51:21] it's worth nothing
[1:51:23] it's got to be God that does the
[1:51:26] transfer
[1:51:27] in you sooner or later if God would have
[1:51:30] allowed I would have went back to the
[1:51:32] life that I lived I would have maybe
[1:51:33] even stepped out on my woman at the
[1:51:35] moment I would have done all kinds of
[1:51:37] atrocities but I thank God that his
[1:51:39] mercy and grace gave me a time period
[1:51:41] like I told you I could be the best
[1:51:45] imitator of a Christian ever and if you
[1:51:48] ask her I was I know how to pray I can
[1:51:51] force myself to cry I can raise my hand
[1:51:54] for petitions I know how to greet the
[1:51:56] pastor or happily and greet the brothers
[1:51:58] and sing and all these things time
[1:52:01] passed on three months later I wanted to
[1:52:04] show off my wife the November
[1:52:07] conventions were taking place here in
[1:52:08] Phoenix Arizona I still hadn't had an
[1:52:11] experience I still hadn't had
[1:52:13] encountered with the person of the Lord
[1:52:15] Jesus Christ but I thought I cannot wait
[1:52:18] to get to Arizona to show off to my
[1:52:21] girlfriend that I know some big-name
[1:52:23] people brothers and sisters and pastors
[1:52:27] and ministers and friends because I was
[1:52:29] so cynical such a hypocrite that I
[1:52:31] wanted to show off if anyone's got a
[1:52:33] real one I've got a real one when I
[1:52:36] think of that moment in my life the only
[1:52:38] word that comes to mind is I don't know
[1:52:39] how to say it in English but when seem
[1:52:42] better when's that complete seem better
[1:52:44] when in my life to think that was
[1:52:46] something that was on my mind to do as
[1:52:49] you all know services happen Friday they
[1:52:52] continue Saturday but once again now God
[1:52:56] had an appointment with me in my life
[1:52:58] every service I was show up early to
[1:53:01] show off to my girlfriend close my eyes
[1:53:04] pretend to pray fall asleep open my
[1:53:08] Bible turn the pages every 2-3 minutes
[1:53:11] so just in case if she looked over at me
[1:53:13] she'd say wow he really is a Christian
[1:53:16] look how much he loves the Lord but
[1:53:19] something about that Sunday morning I
[1:53:21] got into prayer and I started talking to
[1:53:25] God and it came natural for me and it
[1:53:28] came honest for me and that's why I tell
[1:53:30] young people you've got to be honest and
[1:53:32] open with God I know you young people
[1:53:35] have faith you see the power of God
[1:53:38] working each
[1:53:39] every Sunday here in service you feel
[1:53:41] his holy spirit come down you'd be lying
[1:53:44] to me if you told me that you haven't
[1:53:46] felt that presence you've seen that
[1:53:48] presence in your mother and father each
[1:53:51] and every day of your life so I don't
[1:53:53] doubt that you've got faith if there is
[1:53:55] an Almighty God
[1:53:56] but the issue here is you've got to be
[1:53:59] honest and open your heart to him so
[1:54:01] that he can come in and do that job that
[1:54:04] morning as I was praying for the Lord
[1:54:08] I started making inventory of my life
[1:54:10] and I started speaking to him saying
[1:54:11] Lord I'm looking at my life and you've
[1:54:15] protected me my entire life Lord I
[1:54:17] always had my mother and father a roof
[1:54:20] over my head food on the table even in
[1:54:23] the world when I was homeless on the
[1:54:24] streets when I was in jail when I was
[1:54:27] here and there you protected me in every
[1:54:29] step of the way and I said Lord you even
[1:54:32] converted my sinner girlfriend into a
[1:54:35] Christian miraculously in a second but
[1:54:38] God you have never done nothing in my
[1:54:41] life said I don't know you for myself
[1:54:44] told him Lord if you can give me a sign
[1:54:48] I don't care if I jump and shout I don't
[1:54:51] care if I speak in tongues I told him I
[1:54:54] don't care if I don't feel the burning
[1:54:56] inside me that they talk about but a
[1:54:57] sign that's so real to me that no matter
[1:55:01] who I tell it to for the rest of my life
[1:55:03] I know that it was real and that's where
[1:55:06] you need to be at personal experience
[1:55:08] where you know God came into your life
[1:55:10] and can't nobody take that from you
[1:55:13] service continued the minister that
[1:55:16] morning was brother Bob Willard I know
[1:55:18] you all have heard brother Bob very
[1:55:20] fiery brother very energetic brother and
[1:55:22] within the first three minutes brother
[1:55:25] Bob Willard was already speaking to my
[1:55:28] heart all the concerns and questions
[1:55:30] that I had inside me he was answering
[1:55:32] one by one by the end of service such a
[1:55:35] sweet spirit down upon everyone I'm in
[1:55:38] tears I'm crying I'm embracing Lord for
[1:55:42] all that he's given us but I still
[1:55:44] hadn't had no experience and I still
[1:55:47] hadn't had no sign something particular
[1:55:51] about that morning I put my cell phone
[1:55:53] right here in my chest pocket above my
[1:55:56] heart which is something I never do and
[1:55:58] in that morning as brother Bob was
[1:56:00] closing his prayer and my hands in the
[1:56:03] air and crying he makes the mention he's
[1:56:06] calling you he's calling you immediately
[1:56:10] my cellphone starts to vibrate right
[1:56:12] there on my heart and I thought thank
[1:56:14] you Lord this is my sign Lord Jesus
[1:56:16] thank you Jesus but if you don't know
[1:56:20] wherever God is there's the devil as
[1:56:23] well and what he's doing is trying to
[1:56:26] get you to disbelieve trying to get you
[1:56:28] to get confused trying to get you to
[1:56:30] turn the other way like maybe he's doing
[1:56:33] for you young people this morning
[1:56:34] telling you whispering in your ear
[1:56:37] brother Michael's a liar his home is
[1:56:41] still in shambles brother Lisa's is a
[1:56:44] liar they didn't really get that house
[1:56:46] like that he's exaggerating maybe even
[1:56:50] thinking brother Marcos is a fake he's
[1:56:54] from California
[1:56:55] there's no believers in California
[1:56:57] anything that he can do to get you to
[1:57:00] turn aside and not believe and as soon
[1:57:02] as I believe is as soon as I doubt it I
[1:57:05] turned my phone off but I stayed in
[1:57:08] meditation with the Lord
[1:57:09] the preacher went off the song leader
[1:57:12] got on and when I finally was able to
[1:57:14] compose myself I wiped off my tears my
[1:57:16] face looked over at the screen I don't
[1:57:19] know what song it was I don't know what
[1:57:21] part of the lyrics it was but all I
[1:57:22] could read was he's calling you for the
[1:57:26] second time young people on my heart I
[1:57:29] get a phone call right there vibrating
[1:57:32] to my heart if you don't believe me I
[1:57:34] surrendered my life completely to him at
[1:57:37] that moment said Lord forgive me I
[1:57:39] accept you Lord Jesus take me and do
[1:57:42] what you will Lord Jesus I give myself
[1:57:44] to you God I got instead of just being
[1:57:47] touched by his Holy Spirit I felt him
[1:57:49] enter into me with His Holy Spirit songs
[1:57:52] go by songs go by and songs go by then I
[1:57:56] finally compose myself one more time
[1:57:58] wipe myself off I'm joyful I'm happy I
[1:58:03] asked of God and he answered to me just
[1:58:06] the way I asked
[1:58:07] for a simple sign and I look up I can't
[1:58:11] tell you what song I can't tell you what
[1:58:13] melody she's calling you for the third
[1:58:18] time right there on my heart I get a
[1:58:20] phone call once again now you young
[1:58:23] people you know God is perfected in
[1:58:25] three and the way I'd look back in my
[1:58:27] life
[1:58:28] first I doubted then I accepted and the
[1:58:32] third time God sealed it in my life
[1:58:34] I give God thanks each and every day of
[1:58:37] my life because I know without him I
[1:58:40] could not be the same and these eight
[1:58:42] years if I would have still been in the
[1:58:43] world there's no way I would be here
[1:58:45] today and just think of something for
[1:58:47] yourselves young people do the math
[1:58:49] where do you think you will be eight
[1:58:51] years from now if you can't open your
[1:58:54] heart and accept him into your heart for
[1:58:56] him to change your life god bless you
[1:59:00] [Applause]
