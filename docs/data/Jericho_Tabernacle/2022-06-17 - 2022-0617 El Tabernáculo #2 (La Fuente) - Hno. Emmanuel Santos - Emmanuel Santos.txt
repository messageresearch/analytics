that's here and those that listen foreign that they can also receive a blessing from your word i ask you to help me personally we ask you for all these favors in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen as we're standing i'd like to go to the book of exodus chapter 40. and verse 7. [Music] the bible and thou shalt set the lava between the tent of the congregation and the altar and shall put water therein and thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot and sanctify it puerto and thou shalt bring aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and and wash them with water around and thou shalt put upon aaron the holy garments and anoint him and sanctify him that he may minister unto me in the priest's office the special and thou shalt bring his sons and clothe them with coats come on and thou shalt anoint them as thou didst their fathers and they may minister unto me in the priest's office for the anointing shall surely be everlasting priesthood throughout their generations of the tabernacle talk calls it the laver the fuentes the laver is a furniture uh ponian agua where they would place water and uh a priest would do a job for the first time within that tabernacle they first needed to be washed by water fuente that was in the fountain despos you can notice that that represents the process of the new birth the bible says that's because aaron was called to be the high priest and the children they're strictly priests now notice it was for everyone that was a priest in the old testament everyone that's in the new testament that becomes a christian born-again it's the same had to go through that process have to go through that process but spiritually you have to be washed to be covered by [Music] and we give to god the sacrifice of our lips giving praise to his name say i don't feel like it do it that's a sacrifice is you're to make spiritual sacrifices the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name priests and kings unto god and [Music] and we've gone through the same process he was anointed the anointed high priest david said how sweet it is for our brethren to dwell together in unity [Music] it's like unto the precious anointing oil that they poured on aaron's head that ran all the way down to the hems of his skirts aaron was the high priest a type of christ if and notice that anointing oil had in the perfume of the had in it the perfume of the rose of sharon elirio de los valles and the lily of the valley la rosa the rose of sharon is [Music] is a plastada perfume can never be brought from this flower until that flower is crushed and squeezed out of it the perfume to be a sweet smelling savor unto the lord the rose of sharon was beautiful there was something inside it needed aaron also had a garment that was out of the ordinary aaron had something that was called the urim thummin have you ever heard about when brother brandon speaks about that and if those and there was 12 stones jasper sardius carbuncle and so forth on down tenia they got 12 of the big stones that was in the breastplate showing that he was the high priest of every tribe the 12 tribes of israel and after this i beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number the toddlers of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues that stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with right robes and palms in their hands but then it mentions yet another group which is the gentiles which are us christo christ is not only the high priest of the [Music] now remember aaron had the entire breastplate eso represented that represented the entire world but aaron's sons they just had coats eso represented william branham brother branham says in the in the message new ministry william branham christian that's the way a christian is we're nothing compared to him [Music] but we have a portion of his spirit in us and then it acts like him that's what makes us love the people and we have a portion of his spirit like i spoke i want to talk about that furniture called uh the the laverne if you go back to exodus 40. you can read there that it was moses who had an encounter with the pillar and then after having the encounter with the pillar of fire when he made the tabernacle and he started the priesthood it was the prophet who cleansed who watched aaron and his sons i i exist in people and natural there's a type here in the natural but to show how it's going to take place in the spiritual even the furniture that was inside inside its walls todo habla de cristo everything spoke of christ all the furniture in the building typed christ fuente such as the laver indonesia now pay attention to what brother branham says incluso bronte and the brass havela de juicio cuisio divino even at the altar speaks of judgment divine judgment this furniture wasn't just there in the tabernacle just to be there it had a meaning and it was a ladder made of brass you said if you hear the message brother branham for the nature of the serpent which christ took upon himself in la crosse el calvaro at the cross at calvary now this furniture fuente this lava era was made of brass bronze represents brass represents judgment brother branham also says that in the outer courts there was what was called the brass altar and then within those same courts there was that fount that laverne fuentes and both the altar and the lavrov they were now if we go to first peter 4 17. peter says for the time has come the judgment must begin at the house of god literally because that's how it was literally in the tabernacle the first thing that you could see as you enter the tabernacle was the brass altar fuente de bronze and then the lava of brass forest that's why it says that in first peter four que el juice and the first pieces of furniture you'd see as you enter the table the judgment now i want to read this quote a life hidden in christ brother says the outer courts represented justification what was there bautism baptism in water fuente the fountain was placed out there before they were ministering that water represents baptism in water just like when a person is baptized here in the church or in any so they have to go to the altar in the tabernacle after accepting the sacrifice they've got to go to the to the labyrinth then they've got to be baptized who washed the high priest and also washed his sons and clothed them and anointed them now we're going to take all of that from the naturals we're going to apply it now to the spiritual a jesus to jesus and his sons in matthew 3. and verse 13. the bible says entonces jesus then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him now remember the old testament it was the prophet sacrifice it was moses forbade him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and commits that one to me and jesus answered and said unto him suffer to be now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo heavens were open unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lower voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and that was all done through the prophet moses now in grace it's elijah jesus who baptizes jesus jesus and jesus is the entire world foreign and it says it right here in the bible in acts 10 38. he says who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him christ did the same thing that uh it was made of brass and there was water within it now what is our water today we also want to be washed it was aaron that was washed husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself foreign that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word agua natural water in the natural that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish brother branham even says and then sacrificed it says here to be without spot or without wrinkles if you study the message in the bible you can see that spot represents when moses had the encounter with the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire was speaking to him his hand onto his breasts would he bring it out yes the hand was now healed so it says right here in ephesians 5. that after being washed off the water by the word paraquee to have not spot or wrinkle mancha represents pecan spot represents sin our pecans sin is manifested in us different the nature of sin inside of us is taken away but there's another nature of this body and we've always got to subject this body in obedience to the word this is without spot or wrinkle spot speaks of the internal sin and wrinkle speaks about this flesh what is in other words it changes you and gives you the holy ghost in your soul and one day in the resurrection at the resurrection that is nine but it still hasn't washed this body and converting it into a new body without sin a body without spots or wrinkles it's talking about a new body in marcos ds now in mark 10. jesus but jesus said unto them you know not what she asked can you drink of the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with this is a question he asked his disciples now the answer of theirs is in verse 39 they said unto him we can jesus jesus said unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of baptism and with the baptism that i am baptized with all shall ye be baptized now the vessel uh representa or the cup it represents the suffering now remember jesus in gethsemane when he didn't want it in his humanity in his humanity he didn't want to go to the cross at calvary to go through that type of pain perez [Music] but you'll also have the same baptism that i was baptized and if you notice jesus jesus had two baptisms baptism in water by the prophets and also the baptism of the holy spirit record remember the prophet moses he baptized the high priest and his sons [Music] when he was in the ohio river una bospino del cielo a voice came from heaven said just as john the baptist was sent me primer on my first coming tour you are simply not is [Music] [Music] [Applause] you also have the glorious part is the baptism that he has the baptism of elijah and the baptism of the holy ghost but it was why do i go through so much suffering in my life and sometimes it seems like god allows it our heart is like some wet rag that god has to uh uh god allows you to go through that process and put that rose in your heart so everyone can like a hole there in the earth and he said that there was a bad stench that came from that hole and a voice that spoke to him says that represents our sins that represents our sexual nature sin it stinks but but the holy spirit is something aromatic but then sometimes god allows your heart to be squeezed and smashed just like it was with jesus to extract all the oil you've got on the inside there's something god wants to use with that oil now christ brother branham says jesus then in gethsemane jesus died of a broken heart jesus tomorrow prophecy but when jesus took the prophecies of the jubilee year the bible says the spirit of the lord is upon me because you've anointed me because he has the ability to heal my heart instead of something in the world that breaks my heart brother brown says in the message life story yeah oh christian people one of these days i know beyond the reach of mortal kin algundia someday god only knows just where and when the wheels of mortal life will all stand still then i'm going to take a trip to zion's hill i'll see her there again and i'll see jesus where the gates of pearl swing wide open i i just think back across the streets of tears and heartaches and troubles [Applause] [Music] dear jesus to live for you to do the thing no important no matter what the cross is or how scornful it seems to be i love you dear jesus and he starts just draining and straining and squeeze it [Music] to extract all the oil that's in you because god's going to use why because god was with him the prophet says you've broken my heart over and over but i love you for it and the threads that i'm walking on now which are brittle estamas and my life is more than half gone and he set the lava between the tent of the congregation and the altar and put water there to wash with all emo and moses and aaron and his sons wash their hands and their feet their acts when they went into the tent of the congregation and when they came near unto the altar they washed as the lord commanded moses but every time they went to minister in the tabernacle after that they had to wash their hands and their feet that also has an application for us first of all why your hands and feet because hands and feet extremities those are our extremities that's what first touches the external world when someone goes to e especially and their feet sometimes you get filthy with the things of the world and it doesn't mean you haven't been born again that's something different they have not been born again but you know when you make a mistake immediately and immediately your heart it just feels so bad you've got to repent now remember jesus was baptized by elijah completely completely in the water then was anointed but then after some time he was invited to a home and he had to go through that process to clean himself off a little ante completely before entering completely into the home in and that and then it would it would take all the stink from them in his feet and a dusting along the road and would take off all of that then he would slip him on a pair of these little slippers that would fit his feet just right entonces then they'd pull him on his feet then he'd go over a via outro there'd be another flunky i believe it was a hype or a priest whose name was simeon he invited him to his house for a feast you've already been born again as soon as you exit the church and then you go out in the street enter la tienda you enter into the store they get that perfume from a little apple that's from a rosebud that makes the perfumes useless and they would make this perfume and pour it upon their hands and they would wipe their hands in them days that direct ray of that palestinian sun was so hot it would burn their neck in their faces and they take that perfume and oil they wipe their face and over their ears and then they had some kind of like that perfume that would act in place of like menthol [Music] i hope you're catching the similarity of that [Music] and it was groomed and ready prepared we've got to first come and be watched by the water of the word correcto right perfumed by the anointing oil they went on aaron's beard that run all the way to the hems of his skirts brotherly love jesus so all that happened to jesus in the naturals it happens to you in the spiritual jesus just like jesus got a little dirty and he had to groom himself before entering the home that's the same thing you have to do us [Music] dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstinent abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul says do you remember the black dog the white dog in the black dog the white dog is inside the black dog is outside negro and the black dog it says these are he says that it is a fleshly desire you went through that process around the you get a little dirty of it bra and the foot of it of brass of the looking glasses of the woman assembling which assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation looking glass i know that in english uses the word looking glass mirror that which means a mirror or a mirror all right now this lava when it was very well shined it shined and was used as a mirror and so now bronze was a mirror la palabra but the word is bronzing the word is brass that's judgment but it's also a mirror where you see where your error lies he said and you judge yourself of the looking glass which was of brass photos i put some pictures there on the presentation if you'd like to put it up that that brass that's brass but it also serves as a mirror fuente now the lava de bronze was made of brass but it also served as a mirror that's why the word of god is it's judgment but you can see yourself in the words and you apply judgment to yourself but also in the laver was water in santiago uno bentidos in james 1 222 but be your doers of the word and not hears only engagements he is like unto a man but holding his natural face in a glass in other words if you hear the word and you don't obey the word basically you go to this furniture this this laver you send them asbestos and you just see a reflection there agua but you don't use the water that's there to wash yourself in other words you hear the message of the hours and you don't obey what it says this scripture is being fulfilled here you're just looking at yourself but you're not applying but let it be hidden and let it let it be the hidden man of the heart an incorruptible ornato de spiritual pacifico lo qual es de grande in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god a great price those personas now there's two people constable as in the water face and as in water face answereth to face clean water you can see a reflection there in the message it's just one single person but it shows because there's someone outside and there's someone down there inside is for you to be adequately cleansed a person looking at the water you could see yourself identified with different people in the bible it's happened to me four times the third time was me one day i took the bible i was just studying fuente i took the flavor but i took the water of the word i could see the nathaniel did the same thing he was discerned by the messianic signs his heart was discerned with that sign he believed it like this [Music] when the find yourself reflected there's something inside it's calling you it's a deep calling to a deep jesus just like jesus when he resurrected the bible says he was taking the entire prophet in the old testament that talked dude because christ is in the message in christ in you and is your theophany is it's calling you that's why when you hear the message there's something that starts to burn right here you're seeing your reflection in the lavender personas and you could see two people but truly it's just one person i want to end uh i want you to i want to look at me and i want you to look at yourself and as we look into god's great mirror of his word we'll be able to identify ourselves with some some with some that we're going to speak about and i want to see myself in god's looking glass the only way you could see yourself in the words is that first you have christ in you so that the christ that's in you can correspond to the christ in the words a deep calling to a deep us you see yourself in the water you're seeing the brass fuente and taking the water in the ladder and washing yourself all of that is in that single furniture mucho mas there's so much more but we don't have time heavenly father tonight is the oil of the rose of sharon [Music] and after they go throughout this world which the bible says there is no city that will be permanent in this world but until in the name of the lord jesus christ amen [Applause] [Music] above all in all created things [Music] me [Music] um [Music] [Music] there's no way [Music] baby [Music] travel on the ground [Music] above [Music] created [Music] [Music] above [Music] oh [Music] there's no way and you were [Applause] trampled on the ground [Applause] god [Music] let's keep on worshiping the lord [Music] me for he is worthy [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] no glory glory [Music] forever or more [Music] [Music] [Music] senor [Music] [Music] yo [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is there are many many others i shall like to meet them all i do declare by oh there it's going [Music] i am going [Music] [Music] god's own son will be the leading one at the meeting [Music] oh there is going [Music] i am going [Music] such glorious [Music] [Music] amen um the service is now over yes before that um it's time for a word of prayer so can you please stand and
