God loves us Galatians may the Lord help us this morning yesterday I spoke a little with her brother and very quickly I found out his throat wasn't helping him very much yes in this winter the changes in the weather and the temperatures [Music] brothers and sisters I want to give you the time to find the scripture it's important for us to read the word of God I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet Christ lived in me and the life which I now live in the flesh how many live in the flesh currently now living in the flesh we're living in the flesh but listen to what it says and now which I live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God I live by faith in the Son of God this is [Music] I want to thank you this morning Lord we plead and we ask you for everyone that's here United this morning we are thankful for everybody their thoughts and their hearts it was pleasant to visit us this morning Lord we ask that you will give each and every person that what they are asking foreign pastor this morning heal him touch him yeah and everybody this morning that's not feeling good in their body as the word goes forward Lord because the word also is medicine for us so as we hear the word this morning and you may be able to heal them and restore them restore their health this morning and help the congregation the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may take your seats this morning with God's help cremos con Cristo and this morning if God allows us we'd like to speak of the message identifying with Christo identifying with Christ I recommend this message this message identified with Christie he preached it on December 20th of 1959. and Jeffersonville Indiana Jeffersonville Indiana it's a message I recommend to you my brother ordonius preaches when you recommends something for us to read or listening in his preachings I have the privilege if I can say it like that is upon leaving the service grab my phone and my tablet and to seek out the message that he uh gave to us development at all and I don't get up till I listen to the whole entire message like I have a job where it allows me to listen while I'm driving alone and I can hear it multiple times but let's never get tired of listening and reading the message because let's remember that the prophet told us the message and the messenger are one no problem we cannot separate them we can only we cannot only desire the message there are many that only desire the message and not the messenger but we don't want to be like that we want to be knowers of the message but also get to know the [Music] messengerless repeat it again the message and the messenger are one you can't have one without the other simplement simply saying it can't happen you got to have both of them is speaking about identifying with Christ I read a few messages and brother Brandon says I'm identifying myself with Christ on Calvary for all believers Christians they were most star identificados con Cristo we should be identified with Christ that's why I read the Scripture it says like this one more time with Christ I'm also crucified this is a great Apostle Saint Paul is this is a great Apostle the great man of God a prophet an evangelists an example of a of a man with Christ I am also crucified saying he's identified himself of course and that's the same way that we should be the memos are starting we should be identified with Christ and I no longer live Christ that lives in me with Christ I am also crucified how many can say that this morning brother says in that message I'm going to give you a few quotes so that you could take the interest is upon going home and seek out this message and read it and read it over again because we never stop learning if you notice as we're watching something on the television [Music] that's the motive why they played so many times now I bring it like this the reason why we go to the message and we read it and we read it over again let me read it one more time sounds like a broken disc read it again and we say I believe it because he revealed it to me not because my dad believes it not because my sister because he has revealed it to me it has to be a personal revelation each and every one of us blessed be the name of the Lord and when it's a revelation to us [Applause] no one can take it from you nobody so number La Gloria when they told me over there in 1976 that the new name was William Miriam Branham knowing that you're a preacher and I'm a preacher and so we me and you have to place the example so me and you must get baptized in the name of William Mary Brennan brother I opened my eyes tonight because he hadn't told me that before yeah we had started to hear little rumors but he had never told me that but when he told me face to face I told him brother I've done a lot of things of what I am repented but for me to get baptized in the name of William Miriam Branham I'd rather run and I'd rather run there's a baptism that I know of yes it's the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I don't know another name Brothers I was baptized in the three names in the denominations yes [Music] there was baptisms just like there was today and he said almost the same thing brother Louise said the only thing he said is the water is warm he didn't say that but he said the same thing our brother he read the same thing our brother Louise the only difference was what I told you but he explained the baptism in water in the matter that I understood it marvelously I can tell you this morning it was a revelation to me and I had a response I had a response it seemed like I had finished this is what the clothes that I had I went and got into it and I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I prefer to run away and when I say Iran I left the brother fellowship with that church when I left Gloria [Applause] remember we don't have a member only Fellowship are you happy about that this morning can we say the same thing this morning Gloria brother says we don't have a membership here only Fellowship for everyone we don't have like Edward Carter said like he used to say there's no law pero Amor but love are you happy about that this morning no lay there's no law see no Amor but love no credos no Crete Vero Cristo but Christ not books but all La Biblia the Bible this is the first thing here Brothers he didn't have books they came out later yes and we're happy about that this morning but we have to read them we got to listen to them first thing we want to do is read the word of God Gloria amen no libros not books so everyone is welcome here to this small Tabernacle isn't that beautiful let's read another scripture hey we're going to try to advance to where the time allows we're going to read Amos 3 7. I'm all stress name is three seven una is a little bit of a difficult uh scripture to find foreign you have it [Applause] surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his Secrets unto his servants the prophets [Applause] surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his Secrets unto his servants the prophetske did you know Buzz that I looked and brother mentions this scripture more than 114 times and it's beautiful it's a beautiful scripture you know identify with it Believers of this message should identify with this scriptures but when the scripture becomes a revelation to the believer we shall do nothing is when I say nothing means nothing was yes that's how it is he says we shall do nothing here while Senor surely the Lord God until he revealed the secrets unto his servants the prophets this is a quote that's in Revelations and he preaches in the years of the 70s in the 12th month in the fourth day this is The Book of Revelations has more symbols or more symbolic things than any other book in the Bible and we can agree with me the Book of Revelations has more symbols than other other any other book in the Bible it has more symbols because it's a prophetic book do you believe that believe that with all my heart they said it has more symbols because it's a prophetic book es un libero prophetico it's a prophetic books it needs to be understood by a prophetic kind of Glory to be in his name getting us closer amen amen it's a prophetic book it must be understood by prophetic kind [Applause] this book is not for everyone I believe that with all my heart when I began in the denomination [Applause] it's a book that we always want to enter Gloria glory be to his name this book is not for everyone Cassie no there's not too many that can understand it there's not too many that can understand it this book is designed for a certain type of people you said back then he said for a prophetic type here he says it was only made for a certain type of person aren't you happy that we're identifying right ourselves his name amen this book is made for a certain type of people Deuteronomy las cosas I have a scripture here Deuteronomy 29 29 blessed be the name of our Lord Jesus Christ foreign Deuteronomy 29 24 organizations when the organization sent me to a Bible School one of the first things they told me to do as a homework was to learn all the books of the Bible by memory and they only gave me one week said all the books of the Bible and you have one week to learn it is that's why you're here to learn from the Bible the first thing that I learned was all the books of the Bible but ask me now where Joel is or where Amis can be found brother I struggle to find them how many are there 29.29 says the secret things belong to the Lord Our God how many believe that this morning the secret things belong to the Lord our god listen to this this is but those things which are revealed belong unto us which they are to us and to our children forever so that we may do all the words of this laws the lost the prophet Prophets the secret things belong unto the Lord that's correct and he revealed it unto us and to our children in reveals to us are his children the hidden things the mind but those that are lovers of the word of God that's why the book was written for the church the revelation of Jesus Christ for the church in Ephesus the church in Smyrna Iglesia it's the last age and don't says the numbers so glory be to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ said if the God would ask me when would you like to come to this world I would have said and this time and I believe we would also say the same things well in doubt we would have like to really see Jesus who wouldn't like to see that I would like to live in the times of brother Branham I was born in 53. so he was still preaching but I was barely being born when I received the message the anointed ones in the end time was the first message after I read through it I read a letter to him and I sent it off to Jeffersonville res 15 days later I received you would come here to Phoenix [Music] and we're asking foreign so we could see where he was where he rested a while gory beats his name read another scripture with me here I have a few more questions corinthios capitulo dos First Corinthians chapter 2 get him also how beautiful is beautiful that there's brothers and sisters that are able to beat us and finding the description of the Bible glory be to his name I like that blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus the scripture I'm going to read you here is because us as preachers there's probably quite a few of you that are there in advance that can identify with this [Music] on one occasion the brother said I feel like this this morning he went he took the pulpit I believe I've said this story in the past if you haven't heard this story Brothers God bless you yes I'm shaking I'm not sure if it's a fear [Music] how much bravery How brave I feel you guys can be the judge that's how we arrive to this place sometimes and the reason for that because we're speaking to a special people we're speaking to the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] they leave their home they leave their jobs they drive miles and miles foreign sometimes the enemy of Our Lord comes he says what do you drive so far why do you got to drive all the way over there why there's a lot of churches around here in every corner there's a church but remember what we have already read this message is for a special people foreign [Music] senor and those results so those miles that you're driving is that you're sitting there in your car Hermano God is going to repay you greatly blessed be the name of the Lord he said and the word says like this is a great Apostle Paul a great man of God I love speaking about him brother and when I came to you and came with the accidentally speech of wisdom no frequent excellencia de palabras or the saviduria I did not come with Excellency or the speech of wisdom the great Apostle Paul saying this is remember he was educated so I would surpass everybody in my class according to the law Yer I knew everything I said and I came to you not declaring into the testimony of God and with him crucified was Paul identified with Christ with Christ I am also crucified everybody's hearing reading here and I was determined not to know anything see so among you saved Jesus Christ and him crucified here it goes Brothers and I was with and in much trembling the reason why because he was speaking to his special people and we also are speaking to a special people said brother when you come in the morning and you take a seat and it seems like you're a me and you have no meaning and let me tell you this morning you have a very insurmountable value being a brother or a sister you're a grandfather or grandmother you come here every year Wednesday Friday and Sunday but adios for God hermanosa there's a thing that thing has no price you come and you sit down you listen to the word seems like nobody pays attention to you no you don't sing no no testifical you don't testify but you know one thing that's your place and we should be happy with that we should be joyful of that God loves all of us God loves all of us all things for all of us this is with you in weakness and in fear in which much trembling foreign but in demonstrations of the spirit and Power in this message he has to preach and tell the people what's happening today in our time people want to identify themselves they can't find what to identify with [Music] you see those people going driving down the road 85 miles per hour when the speed limit says 45 we suppose that we don't do that mentioned something the other day although I used to do it but when I heard I do even more with all my heart listen to me brother 10 now we have reached 75 miles per hour and they haven't raised it anymore maximum is the lead limit on the highways on the streets it's different you find on some roads it's 45 miles per hour 35 miles per hour but in school zones it's only 25. what's happening to us in these days that everybody wants to be in such a rush from church I live in Glendale and I'm coming here there's not one day that that don't happen the cars always pass me up and when they're passing me up they even rev their engines foreign and we end up finding ourselves in the same place at the red light is that what they wanted persona it's only to scare somebody [Music] they didn't Advance too much because they're there with me that happens to me every single day Gloria glory be to his name God bless our brothers so if you drive over the speed limit Hermanos brothers and sisters you drive over the speed limit if there's a police that's there and sometimes they're not very visible I drive on the highway I drove buses for a lot of years this police don't stop in a place where you could see them you understand what I'm talking about they don't stand in a visible place when I see a cop in a visible place today we saw one and I told my wife God bless this policeman he's there it's only so you could see him again they're going to drop their speed limit and all of a sudden what you will see is the lights and your heart begins to want to jump out of your chest calm down calm down he's a policeman and he has his lights on and he's stopping you you look around he's pulling someone else over no it's you see [Music] there are consequences see us the drivers we drive with a special license one time I was on my way to Los Angeles and I saw what I was talking about is it me it was me I had to pull the bus over to one side I drove maybe about half a mile because there was nowhere to pull over because I could see the lights flashing I said well it's me there's no doubt find out about me he's stopping me and when he came and he greeted me I responded to his greeting and this is the the statement I gave to him after greeting each other and here was my records in tickets driving without a ticket for many years and he heard me [Music] it was a little strange it didn't take very long he came back to me he said Mr your record Remains the Same I only stopped you what is because you were kind of hitting the the barrier line on the right side of the road and I was right behind him and I saw you hitting the white line on the highway for a while that's the reason why foreign they're trying to find something to identify with the reason why they're doing this is because there's something in them God made for them but God made an example so in other words they're looking for an example the people outside are looking for an example and we should also take care of ourselves if we're not careful we'll also start looking for an example outside in the world but the reality our example is here Gloria glory be to his name his name is Jesus and his name is William Branham because brother Branham preach to us a message he is awesome and if there's someone that followed Jesus it was him when they confused him with the Lord Jesus Christ he said I'm going to close everything down I'm going to cancel all my trips tours I'm going to go up to the mountains and perhaps you may hear an accident happen to him he said he was preparing to take his own life he said taking away from the Lord Jesus Christ what belongs only to him I can't do that I am a sinner I was born yo yo yo yo he says me I mentioned three or four times how can I take away that glory and that honor come on to that extreme Williams baptizing in the name of William Branham foreign [Music] oh but God made an example that we can identify with him that example that God made yes and that's when God when God made Jesus Christ to be our savior that's the example Jesus they should identify with Jesus Christ and they should uh desire to be the way he is somebody desire this morning to be like Christ blessed be the name of the Lord that is identifying ourselves with him in the Old Testament I want to read another scripture leviticos Uno cuatro Leviticus 1 4. the Old Testament leviticos Leviticus one four if we find it if you can say Amen levitical Uno cuatro Leviticus 1 4. do you have it I'm going to read the scripture Uno Uno cuatro Sanai this is he said and he shall put hands upon the head of the burnt offering and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him once again and he shall place his hands upon the head of the burnt offering in the Old Testament and when a man wanted to identify in God's house
