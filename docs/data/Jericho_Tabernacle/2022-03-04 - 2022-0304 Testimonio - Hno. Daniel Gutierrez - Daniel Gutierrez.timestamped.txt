[35:49] [Music]
[36:10] astray from the lord
[36:13] [Music]
[36:15] testimonial maybe one day they can
[36:17] happen upon to listen to this testimony
[36:22] and it can be something that's helpful
[36:23] for them
[36:27] and hoping that it has the same effect
[36:29] for those that are here as well
[36:30] [Music]
[36:33] and as well to them that are watching us
[36:34] online
[36:36] [Music]
[36:38] hello we would like to welcome you in
[36:40] the name of the lord jesus christ
[36:44] i would like if you can please
[36:47] to be able to honor the word
[36:53] let's go to the book of saint john
[36:55] capitolo cuatro chapter four version
[36:59] starting with verse 39.
[37:07] [Music]
[37:25] [Music]
[37:27] and many of the samaritans of that city
[37:29] believed on him for the saying of the
[37:30] woman which testified he told me all
[37:33] that i ever did
[37:42] so when the samaritans were come unto
[37:44] him they besought him that he would
[37:46] tarry with them any abode their two days
[37:58] [Music]
[38:10] and said unto the woman now we believe
[38:12] not because of thy saying for we have
[38:14] heard him ourselves and know that this
[38:16] is indeed the christ the savior of the
[38:18] world
[38:22] you may be seated please
[38:26] almost
[38:28] we would like to thank the musicians
[38:39] i believe that music is something that's
[38:41] very beautiful
[38:52] we read in the bible that it says that
[38:54] many believed on the saying of the
[38:56] samaritan woman
[39:00] but then afterwards it was not only
[39:02] based on herself
[39:04] because as they themselves hurt him
[39:09] they were able to see that this was in
[39:11] fact the son of god
[39:25] and i personally identify that's why i
[39:27] really like this scripture
[39:34] because the first time that i ever read
[39:36] a message of the prophet
[39:40] no one ever talked to me about the
[39:42] message
[39:45] i only read a portion of the book
[39:49] and that drew my attention
[39:55] and right away i understood that this
[39:56] was the man of god
[40:01] and from then on
[40:05] i read so much more messages maybe
[40:08] around 50.
[40:12] in the year 1978.
[40:19] we went from the city of juarez to
[40:21] california
[40:32] and while i was there when i began to
[40:35] work somebody began to talk to me about
[40:37] the word of god when do you stand for
[40:38] that juarez when i was in the city of
[40:40] juarez
[40:48] i had no knowledge whatsoever of the
[40:50] word
[40:54] by god's grace
[40:58] i married a christian woman
[41:04] she was born and raised within
[41:06] christianity
[41:09] juanito maybe somebody can remember like
[41:11] brother juanito
[41:17] around 1977 there was a bit of a
[41:18] confusion
[41:23] where the message was really divided
[41:28] many that believed like we did they uh
[41:31] they divided themselves
[41:44] and the one that leaded them the leader
[41:46] you could say of that
[41:47] william soto was william
[41:52] and then from that time on
[42:00] this idiot
[42:01] and even the uncle of my wife he went
[42:04] with that uh that sort of idea
[42:12] and that's when my wife even though she
[42:14] at the moment was not my wife that's
[42:15] when she got confused
[42:20] and for some time that brought her out
[42:22] of christianity
[42:26] i do believe that it was god that
[42:28] allowed that
[42:44] the year 1972 nos casamos mis posayo my
[42:47] wife and i got married
[42:54] we were very young
[42:58] we started a very difficult tough life
[43:05] because basically we were still very
[43:07] young we were kids
[43:13] when there is not a good leadership
[43:14] there's not a good father of the head of
[43:16] the house
[43:20] direction
[43:21] you go out without having that fatherly
[43:24] figure it
[43:40] i was able to see god's love in some
[43:42] people
[43:45] and one of them was the grandmother of
[43:47] my wife
[43:51] she always lived to me what she believed
[43:58] she had all the right to not treat me
[44:04] because i had married her most dearest
[44:07] granddaughter yo no tenia buena fama and
[44:10] i wasn't a guy with a good reputation
[44:19] maybe victor chavez i don't know if he's
[44:20] here he might have known what kind of a
[44:22] man i was back then
[44:26] his mother really did
[44:28] she really didn't know me
[44:30] sister
[44:34] and phoenix
[44:36] so when they saw that in the year of
[44:38] 1983 i was baptized at phoenix
[44:40] tabernacle
[44:45] they said god really transforms people
[44:59] that's what i was trying to say when her
[45:01] grandmother had all the right to not
[45:02] treat me good pero nunca
[45:04] but it was never light up
[45:07] she always respectfully treated me good
[45:10] with a lot of love
[45:15] the same way
[45:17] my mother's wife acted towards me amelia
[45:20] favilla amelia fabila
[45:26] and these women truly lived god's love
[45:28] to me entonces has
[45:32] so that's how we began our marriage life
[45:35] california
[45:38] in 1978 we arrived in california
[45:46] and there was a certain brother from a
[45:48] certain church he began to invite me to
[45:50] go to church
[45:54] but i really was not interested
[45:59] because ever since i was in the city of
[46:00] juarez i was really into music
[46:06] we i had my own band and we would play
[46:08] at the nightclubs
[46:12] so i had no interest in the gospel
[46:18] that's why i can understand where it
[46:19] says that uh no one looked for god realm
[46:24] it's god that comes looking for you
[46:26] foreign
[46:37] i had no interest of getting out of what
[46:39] i was in back then entonces
[46:43] so that's how the years went by
[46:46] phoenix arizona
[46:48] in the year of 1980 we arrived here at
[46:50] phoenix arizona
[46:57] and in 1980 i was still into music here
[47:03] playing and singing at the nightclubs
[47:09] it got to the point that my wife and i
[47:10] were 13 years married
[47:16] and she thought that i was a helpless
[47:18] case
[47:22] we seriously had a conversation and we
[47:24] decided to break up
[47:28] by then my third daughter was just born
[47:35] she was only a year old when we decided
[47:37] to break up
[47:42] but there was something within me
[47:49] i really loved that little girl
[47:54] special because that little girl ever
[47:57] since she was in her mother's womb she
[47:58] was very special
[48:03] that little girl
[48:30] and so that's how time went on and then
[48:32] she was born
[48:35] and when i would arrive early in the
[48:37] morning
[48:40] i would find that the little girl was
[48:41] crying
[48:43] and i would ask
[48:45] i would ask my wife what's wrong with
[48:46] her yes
[48:48] and she said i don't know what's wrong
[48:49] with her
[48:51] and i said well hand her over to me
[48:57] i would hold her in my arms and as soon
[48:59] as i would hold her she would stop
[49:00] crying she would go to sleep
[49:05] and that's how time went on and then the
[49:07] little girl began to walk
[49:12] and she knew at what time i would arrive
[49:19] she would stand waiting on the door and
[49:21] nobody could move her while she was
[49:23] there waiting for me yeah
[49:26] she would grab my hand
[49:28] i'll see you
[49:50] i believe god made her
[49:52] in that special way to soften my heart
[49:56] because my heart
[50:22] that one when it got to the point that
[50:24] we were going to break up
[50:28] that little girl was the the point that
[50:30] hurt me the most
[50:32] i believe that i did love all of my
[50:34] daughters
[50:36] but that little girl was very special
[50:52] there was no way for me to doubt that
[50:53] this was god
[51:00] when i was a child i lived in a little
[51:01] village of the state of coagula
[51:06] when i was around the age of four five
[51:08] or six
[51:12] and god uh reminded me of that stage
[51:17] when i was a child
[51:49] and god would make me look at that scene
[51:50] when that little boy was going to the
[51:52] bed crying
[51:56] because i was hungry
[52:02] and as i was walking
[52:04] pensando i was thinking
[52:10] i could hear my own thinking of that
[52:12] little boy
[52:14] i would say
[52:16] when i get older you know
[52:20] i won't allow my children to go through
[52:22] this
[52:25] and god was reminding me of that
[52:29] he said do you remember that
[52:36] and now you're going to leave your
[52:37] family because you want to live the way
[52:39] you want to
[52:43] yes
[52:58] just
[53:12] again
[53:14] and what about your daughters
[53:16] what's going to happen to them
[53:20] and those two voices are constantly
[53:22] going back and forth day and night
[53:26] and i couldn't sleep day or night
[53:30] because those voices wouldn't let me go
[53:32] to sleep
[53:40] until i felt that i was going crazy
[53:42] because i couldn't even go to sleep
[53:46] so what i did is i began to cry out to
[53:47] god
[53:48] and i said lord
[53:51] if it truly is you see this
[53:54] if it is you and you do change people's
[53:56] lives
[53:59] if you change mind then i'll serve you
[54:03] because i can't change lord yo no
[54:05] i don't know you yo no real men existed
[54:22] if
[54:46] and then i started making up excuses to
[54:48] not go to sing at the night
[55:01] and that neighbor suddenly he began to
[55:03] change
[55:10] instead of having grass on it he had
[55:12] bottles of beers scattered all over the
[55:14] place
[55:16] but one day he went to my house
[55:29] he said no because today is the last day
[55:32] yeah
[55:35] tomorrow and then
[55:36] in the future i'll serve the lord
[55:41] i said well if that's good for you and
[55:43] your family then that's really good
[55:46] i didn't believe him
[55:48] but from then on
[55:53] i began to see that first he began to
[55:55] clean up his yard
[56:01] and then on the following sunday i saw
[56:03] that he got up he was nicely dressed
[56:06] and he just waved immediately
[56:09] and he says uh daniel we're going to
[56:11] church
[56:13] and i said uh we'll go another day
[56:17] and about two or three weeks went by
[56:19] immediately
[56:22] and he invited me again he uh came um
[56:25] illegal fourth time to ask me
[56:28] and he asked me this yeah boy are you
[56:29] going to go with me this time yeah
[56:34] and he said well on sunday we'll leave
[56:35] at 9 30. i said that's fine
[56:37] that's fine domingo estaba
[56:40] on sunday i was ready
[56:56] and then he talked to the pastor
[57:01] and they started making me song lead
[57:04] me
[57:05] and i liked it
[57:10] i began to feel that there was a
[57:11] transformation taking place in my life
[57:16] because god always places a person to
[57:19] help you
[57:22] god makes someone to speak to you
[57:39] so i was at that church for about a year
[57:42] everything was going smoothly
[57:47] but then suddenly they wanted to teach
[57:48] me to speak in tongues
[57:51] and i don't speak in
[57:58] by then i had already read the messages
[57:59] of brother branham
[58:02] juarez because every time i would go to
[58:03] juarez
[58:05] from here to
[58:06] juarez
[58:08] my gran my
[58:10] my wife's grandmother
[58:14] would always give me the messages of
[58:15] brother branham
[58:32] and we would get here and my wife would
[58:34] put them away for me
[58:38] but the day came that she was reading
[58:40] one of those books
[58:42] she was preparing my preparing my lunch
[58:48] she saw then that i got up
[58:51] she put that book on the table
[58:55] she uh prepared my lunch and put in the
[58:57] lunchbox
[59:03] i sat down and i began to read that book
[59:07] and then i couldn't get out of it
[59:12] from the point that i started reading
[59:13] the book of that message
[59:17] i felt that it was god speaking through
[59:19] that man
[59:25] so the time came that i finished reading
[59:27] all the books that we had
[59:30] me
[59:44] pastor and the brothers in the
[59:46] government i was explaining to them
[59:52] and i tried to explain to them why they
[59:54] emphasized so much on speaking
[59:57] on
[1:00:03] and i
[1:00:04] quoted the scripture that says speaking
[1:00:05] in tongues is the smallest gift that god
[1:00:07] can give to a man
[1:00:10] and to rather look for more for the gift
[1:00:12] of
[1:00:19] so i spoke to him and he said no no this
[1:00:21] is what i understand and this is what i
[1:00:23] teach because
[1:00:30] he said if you feel that you don't feel
[1:00:32] good here then you're free to go
[1:00:33] somewhere else
[1:00:36] i said you're right thank you
[1:00:40] i said i hope you can forgive me i'm not
[1:00:42] trying to be smart
[1:00:47] i'm simply just reading the scripture
[1:00:48] and that's what i saw and that's why i
[1:00:50] remarked it
[1:00:55] but actually it's something that i
[1:00:56] carried in my heart to be able to tell
[1:00:58] you yes
[1:01:04] and then we kept going to the same
[1:01:05] church around two years
[1:01:09] by then they wouldn't say hi to us
[1:01:10] anymore
[1:01:14] when we would exit to greed they would
[1:01:15] turn their back on us
[1:01:18] they didn't want to speak to us
[1:01:23] so one day we were on basis
[1:01:26] going to the evening service
[1:01:30] when we passed by phoenix
[1:01:35] and i told my wife uh let's go there
[1:01:40] i didn't know that brother bernie was
[1:01:41] there
[1:01:48] we heard that they started speaking
[1:01:50] about the prophet
[1:01:54] and that's where i felt comfortable
[1:01:58] and that's where i stayed
[1:02:01] that was at the end of 1983
[1:02:07] and now we know why we're not there
[1:02:09] anymore
[1:02:12] so as time went on
[1:02:15] we have been able to see
[1:02:18] that god
[1:02:30] because it's something that i can say by
[1:02:32] personal elections
[1:02:43] so just like other uh this woman that we
[1:02:45] read here in the scripture the samaritan
[1:02:46] woman
[1:03:33] and the desire to try to share with the
[1:03:35] people that didn't believe in this
[1:03:36] message
[1:03:38] so then we started going to the
[1:03:40] missionary field
[1:03:45] and we were able to
[1:03:47] witness and experience a lot of miracles
[1:03:52] many times i was able to see uh
[1:03:54] alermanov
[1:03:55] brother bernie
[1:04:09] i was fixing up the microphones at the
[1:04:11] church
[1:04:13] when i heard voices outside the church
[1:04:18] so i went to go see what was going on
[1:04:23] and there was a brother that was having
[1:04:24] seizures
[1:04:33] when that brother was there lying on the
[1:04:34] floor yeah
[1:04:36] his mouth was
[1:04:39] and bleeding was a lot of people
[1:04:40] surrounding him
[1:04:45] that's when brother bernie was coming
[1:04:47] closer
[1:04:49] he came with his white shirt
[1:04:52] and with this tie
[1:04:54] in service
[1:04:57] ready to have the service he only needed
[1:04:59] his uh his coat
[1:05:01] when he saw us there
[1:05:04] he asked what's what's the matter yeah
[1:05:06] is
[1:05:10] i was explaining that the brother was
[1:05:11] having a seizure he else implemented
[1:05:14] me and he simply said uh just leave him
[1:05:16] to me
[1:05:17] and he bowed
[1:05:20] and he hugged him
[1:05:23] with his white shirt
[1:05:24] say you know that's angry it was uh
[1:05:27] stained with blood
[1:05:29] but it didn't matter to him
[1:05:32] he simply embraced him
[1:05:34] cuentas
[1:05:47] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:05:48] leave him immediately
[1:05:52] immediately that spirit came out of him
[1:05:55] because that man then got up
[1:05:58] he got up he was confused
[1:06:01] he wasn't aware of what was happening
[1:06:06] but now he was free delivered
[1:06:11] that's why i believe that there's
[1:06:12] several of us here okay
[1:06:28] [Music]
[1:06:32] and that way through his guidance we
[1:06:34] began to head out to the missionaries
[1:06:38] we were able to witness many miracles
[1:06:40] when manifestation del espirito santo
[1:06:42] venia when the manifestation of the holy
[1:06:44] ghost would come
[1:06:47] even demons would be cast out
[1:06:53] i would pray for people whose faces
[1:06:55] would be transformed so transform their
[1:06:58] voices would change
[1:07:04] and then on a certain occasion one time
[1:07:05] at my house
[1:07:08] they brought this person to me
[1:07:10] it was a sister
[1:07:12] and when i began to pray for her
[1:07:16] her her face changed so both
[1:07:19] her voice changed
[1:07:21] manos and from my hands
[1:07:27] they began to slide off as if her own
[1:07:29] face was slippery
[1:07:33] and she began to slither towards the
[1:07:34] door as as if she were herself
[1:07:39] the husband ran and he got her yeah
[1:07:45] and we prayed for her then and
[1:07:47] thankfully she was freed
[1:07:53] and there's so many experiences just
[1:07:54] like that one especially
[1:07:57] experiences of drug addiction
[1:08:02] i've prayed for people that are that
[1:08:04] have been in drugs
[1:08:07] that they have really heavy demons on
[1:08:08] them
[1:08:11] victorious
[1:08:12] and god has always come out on top
[1:08:13] victorious
[1:08:14] [Music]
[1:08:16] because all that's ever needed
[1:08:18] is for a person to be sincere
[1:08:22] and want to be free
[1:08:25] that's all that's needed
[1:08:28] god's power is here
[1:08:31] to set free
[1:08:33] and to heal
[1:08:35] anything
[1:08:36] solamente
[1:08:51] that's right it's really important
[1:08:55] that when someone is being prayed for
[1:08:58] man
[1:08:59] that you keep your eyes closed
[1:09:02] it is something that's dangerous
[1:09:09] and they're looking for another
[1:09:11] neglectful body
[1:09:14] that is not being reverent
[1:09:18] and then that person can
[1:09:20] acquire that demon
[1:09:25] that why that way we can see that
[1:09:27] gadarian
[1:09:31] it's a well-known scripture
[1:09:37] and there we can see how a person can be
[1:09:39] transformed little by little personas
[1:09:42] and there are people that simply don't
[1:09:44] understand
[1:09:48] joining together with a bad company or
[1:09:50] bad friends
[1:09:54] you can be infected or acquire their own
[1:09:56] demons
[1:10:00] demons that not even the animals put up
[1:10:02] with pores
[1:10:07] that's why the demon possessed gadarin
[1:10:10] controlled
[1:10:11] he had no self-control
[1:10:28] it was the power of that demon that was
[1:10:30] inside of him
[1:10:33] that man felt no pain
[1:10:36] he wouldn't feel anything
[1:10:40] so then the devil would give him the
[1:10:42] power to break those chains
[1:10:45] but something tremendous that draws my
[1:10:47] attention
[1:10:49] that when this gallery in man
[1:10:54] he would uh jump on everyone that would
[1:10:56] pass through there
[1:11:01] and when he saw that jesus christ was
[1:11:03] approaching the shore
[1:11:05] saliva
[1:11:06] he was going to jump on him
[1:11:10] the bible says that he ran towards him
[1:11:16] and then it says that when he saw him
[1:11:18] face to face
[1:11:22] there was such an expression of love in
[1:11:24] his face santa pass so much peace
[1:11:30] that no human is able to express that
[1:11:32] love and peace
[1:11:36] so he acknowledged that this was not a
[1:11:38] common human being
[1:11:40] he acknowledged who he was
[1:11:46] he said what ha what do you have to do
[1:11:48] with us
[1:11:51] son of the most high that you come to
[1:11:52] torment
[1:12:08] he wants the believers to keep
[1:12:10] themselves isolated
[1:12:13] because he knows when that the believers
[1:12:15] gather together
[1:12:17] there is power then porque se une estata
[1:12:35] is left powerless
[1:12:37] it doesn't matter what comes
[1:12:41] god always comes out victorious
[1:12:47] that's why we have this pandemic
[1:12:51] it's just a plan
[1:12:54] the plan is close down the churches
[1:13:00] keep the believer isolated
[1:13:03] and dis unified con miedo and fearful
[1:13:06] cuando la villa nos de clarino
[1:13:09] no no espirito de covardia when the
[1:13:11] bible itself told us that god has not
[1:13:13] given us a spirit of fear
[1:13:15] dion
[1:13:16] spirit
[1:13:30] god has given us the authority over
[1:13:31] every country
[1:13:34] god has given us the power here
[1:13:36] to cast out demons
[1:13:39] he's given us the power
[1:13:42] to pray for the sick it is
[1:13:58] convinced of that
[1:14:03] to be able to put god's power into
[1:14:05] action
[1:14:09] we know that god has given us a very
[1:14:10] beautiful church
[1:14:14] he's given us a very beautiful group of
[1:14:16] brothers and sisters
[1:14:18] and the power is now here
[1:14:20] amen
[1:14:24] that's why it's a viral importance
[1:15:21] a beautiful church
[1:15:26] we're happy because of it
[1:15:31] in less than a year we already have the
[1:15:32] church and says
[1:15:35] that's not just by chance
[1:16:03] so you can rest if you have this
[1:16:49] the prophet said that there will be a
[1:16:50] time
[1:16:52] and the bride will be just one e
[1:16:55] when that takes place
[1:16:58] he said then great things will be
[1:16:59] manifested
[1:17:14] this past sunday
[1:17:22] maybe
[1:17:23] you weren't aware but i was in the there
[1:17:25] in the town of san luis rio colorado
[1:17:28] i
[1:17:37] uh just on that sunday there was only
[1:17:38] four people there
[1:17:42] we held the morning service there
[1:17:48] and in the afternoon we went with
[1:17:50] another group of brothers
[1:17:53] who are also believers of this message
[1:18:08] those are brothers that i visited over a
[1:18:10] time period of 15 years
[1:18:15] and it had been around 15 years that i
[1:18:17] have not gone over it
[1:18:22] so then i felt the desire to go there
[1:18:38] there was only four people
[1:18:43] and then in the afternoon when we went
[1:18:44] with the other group
[1:18:48] they told us that they were waiting for
[1:18:50] us there in the morning
[1:18:54] their group is over a little over 30.
[1:18:57] around 30 or 40 people
[1:19:01] communication maybe because of a lack of
[1:19:03] communication uh no
[1:19:06] no organization
[1:19:08] we weren't able to organize everything
[1:19:10] right
[1:19:13] i believe they would have been even more
[1:19:14] beautiful
[1:19:18] that we were taking those
[1:19:29] we even were able to manage something
[1:19:31] because brother leyva already knows how
[1:19:32] to get it
[1:19:49] the lord is about to come for a people
[1:19:53] people that look for him
[1:19:55] uh people that is waiting for him
[1:20:00] and he's coming for that people yo okay
[1:20:06] i believe that there are some people
[1:20:07] here
[1:20:08] esperando that are waiting for man that
[1:20:11] love him
[1:20:14] and they have made themselves ready for
[1:20:15] when he comes and says
[1:20:31] next time i go the ones that go from
[1:20:33] here
[1:20:37] if you like you can go to that place as
[1:20:39] well they're already waiting for us
[1:20:42] in phoenix the pastor that's here now in
[1:20:44] phoenix
[1:20:46] because of his health
[1:20:49] he already knows about it
[1:20:55] it's just up to us to search for that
[1:20:57] fellowship
[1:21:15] we're going to read a quote from brother
[1:21:16] branagh's message hebrews chapter 6 part
[1:21:18] 2.
[1:21:25] do you see and it reads
[1:21:36] paragraph 84 he says it's now a finished
[1:21:39] work
[1:21:40] cristo murio
[1:22:50] because we don't see ourselves as
[1:22:51] finnish works
[1:22:54] but that's the beautiful part
[1:22:56] of nosotros
[1:22:58] he now seizes us
[1:23:02] he doesn't see us as the way we say
[1:23:18] and put god's word into practice
[1:23:22] and god will vindicate that word
[1:23:30] in the book of the seven church ages
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:24:01] it might have to be that you have to
[1:24:03] seal your testimony with your very blood
[1:24:05] melees
[1:24:09] thousands and even
[1:24:10] millions have died throughout the ages
[1:24:14] they died
[1:24:24] they did not treasure or cherish their
[1:24:26] own life as something precious even in
[1:24:28] death
[1:24:32] we often think that it would be nearly
[1:24:34] impossible to be a martyr
[1:24:37] but just remember
[1:24:39] that faith
[1:24:42] jesus that we use on a daily basis to
[1:24:44] triumph in christ jesus
[1:24:48] polycarpus is the same faith that held
[1:24:51] up polycarp yatodo los martires and all
[1:24:54] the martyrs la fesu prema
[1:24:56] gracia
[1:25:37] that's why there's a tremendous watch
[1:25:40] for the bride
[1:25:43] before she's raptured
[1:25:48] as someone asked the prophet
[1:25:55] they asked him will the bride have an
[1:25:57] end time ministry
[1:25:59] and he says sure she will es
[1:26:03] that's what's starting now
[1:26:05] and says
[1:26:11] is to consecrate our life even more to
[1:26:13] god
[1:26:15] pablo and do what paul said you have i
[1:26:18] die daily
[1:26:20] how do
[1:26:30] and we allow for the holy ghost
[1:26:33] to take full control in our lives
[1:26:39] god will give us that power
[1:26:44] to be able to be raptured from this
[1:26:48] earth and before that we'll see the
[1:26:50] manifestation of the of the third pole
[1:26:54] in a very uh broad way
[1:26:59] where the spoken word will be manifested
[1:27:06] the prophet only did a little bit of
[1:27:07] that cuando el mismo
[1:27:11] when the lord himself told him just
[1:27:13] speak
[1:27:14] speak the word
[1:27:16] what is
[1:27:30] but then when he spoke the word yestava
[1:27:32] there they were
[1:27:35] so even for the bride en este tiempo in
[1:27:37] this time nova tener nada uh she won't
[1:27:41] have anything
[1:27:43] has
[1:27:47] just like the prophet had nothing but
[1:27:48] when he spoke the word it was manifest
[1:27:53] the lord jesus christ multiplied what
[1:27:55] was already there
[1:27:58] existencia it's not that he's not able
[1:28:00] to bring something into experience
[1:28:04] but he already he was simply multiplying
[1:28:06] what was already there multiplico los
[1:28:08] panes he multiplied the bread
[1:28:10] multiplicolo species he multiplied the
[1:28:12] fish
[1:28:25] then came into existence
[1:28:40] be sure that we're ready when the lord
[1:28:42] comes
[1:28:43] back
[1:28:45] and the lord will give us what we have
[1:28:47] needed
[1:28:51] we'll be closing with the scripture
[1:28:54] if you would like to
[1:29:36] and the abominable io
[1:29:38] and murderers los fornicarios and
[1:29:41] whoremongers
[1:29:43] and sorcerers
[1:29:45] and idolaters
[1:29:47] and other liars
[1:29:52] shall have their part in the lake which
[1:29:54] burneth with fire and brimstone
[1:29:57] which is the second death
[1:29:59] amendment
[1:30:04] brothers
[1:30:19] word
[1:30:21] what would have become of us
[1:30:24] what would have become of me
[1:30:28] if you did not transform
[1:30:31] if you would have not called vienna
