[54:18] [Music]
[54:24] wives
[54:26] submit yourselves unto your own husband
[54:30] as unto the lord
[54:32] [Music]
[54:37] for the husband is the head of the wife
[54:40] even as christ is the head of the church
[54:44] and he is the savior of the body
[54:47] for maridos
[54:50] christos
[54:56] therefore as the church is subject to
[54:59] christ
[55:00] so let the wise be to their own husbands
[55:03] in everything
[55:12] husbands love your wives even as christ
[55:15] also loved the church and gave himself
[55:18] for it
[55:26] that he might sanctify it and cleanse it
[55:28] with the washing of the water by the
[55:31] word
[55:41] [Music]
[55:46] we might not be taking too long today
[55:52] i think my throat's acting up today
[55:57] loosen up the collar here
[55:59] don't careful cue
[56:03] i'll do what what
[56:04] brother branham
[56:06] talks about the brother that put a
[56:09] for the breath in his mouth and he and
[56:11] he started preaching
[56:13] this
[56:26] and the deacons took him to the side
[56:29] afterwards
[56:34] we appreciated your message but uh
[56:37] it took a little longer than usual twice
[56:39] as long
[56:42] again
[56:46] he goes yeah usually i put a breath mint
[56:48] on my mouth when i'm speaking and
[56:51] this time it turned out
[56:53] that i was taking a little longer than
[56:55] usual see this is
[57:24] even more when i'm a little nervous
[57:30] i have a few updates before we get
[57:32] started
[57:36] brother juanito saucedo was in mexico
[57:39] last week
[57:43] in mexico he was the brother of orleans
[57:49] he says
[57:50] they had some good services out there
[57:55] [Music]
[57:57] and he was scheduled to to speak with us
[58:00] that is brother juanito
[58:05] but his daughter has covet
[58:10] and she lives with him
[58:12] so i had to take his place
[58:16] so whenever his family gets better he'll
[58:19] return
[58:27] [Music]
[58:32] so the proper thing to do
[58:34] is to stay at home
[58:39] wait a few days
[58:42] to get better
[58:45] and when they are all
[58:47] clear everyone's clear from the culvert
[58:49] yeah
[58:52] then you can get back
[58:54] get back and
[58:56] come to church
[59:00] i think that's a proper thing to do
[59:02] right
[59:05] if you have someone at home that's sick
[59:10] and you're taking care of them
[59:13] as a person we know that that kobe is
[59:14] highly contagious
[59:30] we do have a lot of families that are
[59:32] out
[59:34] families
[59:35] but it's better for them to get better
[59:40] and once they're better we we
[59:43] we like to see them
[59:52] so
[59:54] we know that
[59:55] virus is uh
[59:58] is very contagious
[1:00:04] but over 99 of the people are
[1:00:08] make it through the through the virus
[1:00:24] and take your medicine as soon as
[1:00:26] possible
[1:00:34] but even then you you have to be careful
[1:00:36] when you're out there
[1:00:40] is
[1:00:54] he told me everyone's going to get the
[1:00:55] virus sooner or later
[1:01:00] i really hadn't thought about that too
[1:01:02] much
[1:01:06] you told me you know what just
[1:01:07] everybody's going to get it sooner or l
[1:01:22] take care of each other
[1:01:25] and be careful
[1:01:30] we're also thinking about
[1:01:32] having a
[1:01:33] potluck type of thanksgiving november
[1:01:37] 21st
[1:01:45] that'll be in a couple of weeks
[1:01:49] it'll be uh
[1:01:51] before
[1:01:52] the actual thanksgiving
[1:01:58] it'll be after the message
[1:02:04] type thanksgiving outside or in the
[1:02:07] fellowship hall
[1:02:08] salad
[1:02:10] companies
[1:02:14] no brother brian says that thanksgiving
[1:02:17] is one of the most
[1:02:18] religious festivals or
[1:02:21] holidays america has it is
[1:02:27] festivals
[1:02:29] in america i remember
[1:02:31] in my home
[1:02:44] and i thought that was a big thing
[1:03:14] and that was a big thing for us
[1:03:20] and i think we should celebrate it
[1:03:22] somehow
[1:03:26] so what do you think you like the idea
[1:03:42] so
[1:03:44] i would say get with the sisters
[1:03:50] and uh maybe they can plan us a good
[1:03:53] thanksgiving
[1:03:55] dinner
[1:04:11] they look much better than our curtains
[1:04:16] and we thank the brothers who have been
[1:04:18] working on them painting them getting
[1:04:20] them fixed
[1:04:27] we're improving a little bit at a time
[1:04:31] we thank everyone that has
[1:04:33] put an effort to it
[1:04:39] you know brother joseph branham
[1:04:42] he uh he sends us a
[1:04:45] text information on tapes they hear
[1:04:47] every week all right
[1:05:06] up to anyone
[1:05:12] that's the one we should look at
[1:05:16] well ibrahim calls him a minor prophet
[1:05:18] yes
[1:05:21] brother brian calls him that monogram
[1:05:24] i call him
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:26] and we should have respect for the man
[1:05:32] to for brother joseph branham jose
[1:05:36] branham
[1:05:37] no he sent us a
[1:05:39] tape last week called the thinking man's
[1:05:41] filter
[1:05:47] we're part of it on wednesday
[1:06:17] is how brother abraham blasted the
[1:06:19] american companies
[1:06:24] how the american companies
[1:06:27] can promote a product
[1:06:30] americana
[1:06:33] pay their scientists or doctors to say
[1:06:36] the wrong thing
[1:06:40] is
[1:06:43] everybody knowing
[1:06:46] that it's a bad product
[1:06:50] and yes promote it as a good product
[1:06:57] how could our people our own american
[1:06:59] companies
[1:07:03] our own people mr pro pueblo promote
[1:07:07] something that they know it's going to
[1:07:08] kill you
[1:07:38] i wonder if
[1:07:40] there's a reason that brother joseph
[1:07:42] sent us that tape
[1:07:44] we're going to see
[1:07:45] in particular
[1:07:49] something to think about
[1:07:52] can't trust
[1:07:53] everything you hear us
[1:08:04] i wonder if this is happening today
[1:08:08] that's what really interests me about
[1:08:10] this this subject is
[1:08:14] a thinking man's filter
[1:08:18] a thinking man's filter el filtro de
[1:08:21] nombre
[1:08:24] smoking is a death sentence
[1:08:31] and they proved that by mentioning or
[1:08:33] brother brahm proved that by mentioning
[1:08:35] the tests that were done at
[1:08:42] yet the companies were promoting it as a
[1:08:45] good production embargo
[1:08:54] a thinking man would smoke
[1:08:57] this brand of cigarettes
[1:09:03] now once again they paint their own
[1:09:04] scientists
[1:09:08] to say it was a safe product
[1:09:12] they paid their doctors to say it was a
[1:09:14] safe product
[1:09:18] and yet the companies knew that it would
[1:09:21] kill the user
[1:09:25] material
[1:09:27] they knew it would kill the users
[1:09:32] isn't
[1:09:55] you're making a product to kill somebody
[1:09:57] is
[1:10:06] that's a tough way to start a message
[1:10:13] a product that'll kill you
[1:10:31] now on line 39 of a thinking man's
[1:10:34] filter i'm just going to go over the
[1:10:36] thinking man's filter and then
[1:10:38] we'll call it an evening a day
[1:10:41] uh solamente
[1:10:49] now i thought how deceiving that is
[1:10:55] now that a tobacco companies are
[1:10:57] supposed to be american
[1:11:02] americans oh and we live in our
[1:11:05] policy
[1:11:07] we would be working
[1:11:09] to help one another you
[1:11:22] and how hypocritical is the reason i
[1:11:26] never called the company's name i've got
[1:11:29] to say something
[1:11:31] some bad things about them
[1:11:38] and how hypocritical can anybody be to
[1:11:42] make money
[1:11:47] to make money
[1:11:50] a thinking man wouldn't smoke at all
[1:11:55] but how the american public fall for it
[1:12:02] they think that that's wonderful
[1:12:06] and now look you cannot you cannot ask
[1:12:09] anybody scientists you'll
[1:12:13] you cannot have smoke without having tar
[1:12:18] us
[1:12:27] if there's one little speck of smoke
[1:12:29] comes through that star
[1:12:33] um
[1:12:37] and if you don't get any smoke well you
[1:12:39] get
[1:12:40] you don't get any tar
[1:12:42] no
[1:12:44] no
[1:12:46] and you don't get anything you know
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:58] but as long as you get any smoke at all
[1:13:00] you're drawing in cancer
[1:13:12] a poisonous alkaloid
[1:13:15] c10h14
[1:13:18] n2 that is the sheep active principle of
[1:13:21] tobacco
[1:13:23] and that is used as an insecticide and
[1:13:26] sometimes used in smoking cessation aids
[1:13:51] and if you have been with me last year
[1:13:54] or the year before last i believe it was
[1:13:57] at the world spur when your brain or
[1:14:00] brainerd
[1:14:01] and all of them was up there on
[1:14:03] demonstrations
[1:14:05] and you see them
[1:14:07] take the cigarette
[1:14:08] put it in something
[1:14:10] and put it across a piece of marble
[1:14:32] anyone know who your brain brainer is
[1:14:36] joe breiner
[1:14:37] us old folks
[1:14:40] he was the one that played the part of
[1:14:42] the pharaoh in the ten commandments
[1:14:49] he's the same person
[1:14:52] well he died in 1986 of lung cancer
[1:15:00] he was a heavy smoker
[1:15:03] as what i understand
[1:15:08] and that doctor taking a swab called
[1:15:11] rolled across there
[1:15:13] and got the nicotine off of it and put
[1:15:16] it on the back of a white rat
[1:15:18] and put him in a cage
[1:15:22] he
[1:15:33] and every seven days they took him out
[1:15:36] and the rat was so full of cancer
[1:15:38] couldn't walk for the nicotine out of
[1:15:41] the cigarettes
[1:16:01] you know
[1:16:03] they say that you you can't get it
[1:16:05] through a filter he said you cannot have
[1:16:08] a filter
[1:16:10] any filter that would take nicotine out
[1:16:12] it takes the smoke out
[1:16:15] said because you have to have smoke
[1:16:18] have tar to make the smoke and it's the
[1:16:21] tar that gives cancer
[1:16:25] us
[1:16:38] and then he went and pulled it through
[1:16:40] the water and said sometimes you think
[1:16:42] you could filter it through set every
[1:16:45] time
[1:16:46] that no matter where you pull it
[1:16:49] said
[1:16:50] they they say i don't inhale it then put
[1:16:54] it it
[1:16:56] then put it in their mouth and spit it
[1:16:59] out
[1:17:01] then he
[1:17:02] took that and rolled it up and put it
[1:17:04] under something there and showed it was
[1:17:06] still cancer
[1:17:13] produced
[1:17:37] what are you doing swallowing it down
[1:17:40] your throat see no matter what you do
[1:17:42] it's still death
[1:17:53] and then to think that a company
[1:17:56] would deceive a man
[1:17:59] even though they tried to deceive their
[1:18:01] own people
[1:18:03] it's like a vulture living up
[1:18:06] there's its own kind
[1:18:10] of pencil
[1:18:20] money making selling death to the
[1:18:23] country
[1:18:24] and to young men
[1:18:26] and go out there in on the battlefront
[1:18:30] and ate
[1:18:32] and die for them then turn around and
[1:18:35] sell such a thing as that under a false
[1:18:38] pretense
[1:18:55] a thinking man's filter
[1:18:58] but a smoky man's taste
[1:19:00] you'd have to have the smoke to get the
[1:19:03] taste
[1:19:04] a smoking man's taste
[1:19:18] false pretense
[1:19:21] false
[1:19:22] representations concerning past or
[1:19:25] present facts
[1:19:28] that are made with the intent to defraud
[1:19:32] another
[1:19:33] the definition of protection
[1:19:48] to
[1:20:02] don't believe everything you hear
[1:20:05] not every product they sell you is is a
[1:20:08] good product
[1:20:12] sponsors
[1:20:16] doesn't mean it's good for you
[1:20:20] it's up to you depending on the state
[1:20:22] how the people fall for it
[1:20:25] though they get it
[1:20:28] now it's only to deceive you
[1:20:45] for you
[1:20:47] they sell you that stuff just to watch
[1:20:49] you die as long as they get their money
[1:20:58] like politics and war como la politica
[1:21:02] i don't believe in war i don't believe
[1:21:03] that we all ever should have
[1:21:06] ever had a war you know
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:11] album
[1:21:14] i believe in the kingdom that god is
[1:21:16] bringing the great civilization that
[1:21:18] will be brought down under his own great
[1:21:21] dominion there will never be another war
[1:21:25] nation won't lift up spirits against
[1:21:27] nations they'll all be peace eternal
[1:21:31] peace
[1:21:37] civilization
[1:21:50] so this kind of civilization brings war
[1:21:53] is the class of the civilization the
[1:21:56] more civilized we get under this the
[1:21:59] more war we have
[1:22:02] entre
[1:22:06] one trying to be more civilized than the
[1:22:08] other
[1:22:09] and the more civilized we get the more
[1:22:12] wars
[1:22:21] and look what under the civilization
[1:22:24] that a person will put out such a thing
[1:22:26] as that
[1:22:28] and the only thing it does it only
[1:22:30] deceives you
[1:22:33] to make you
[1:22:34] buy more cigarettes
[1:22:49] smoke
[1:22:50] cigarettes
[1:22:52] and i believe it is of the devil and
[1:22:55] there is a nicotine devil in a man
[1:22:59] and or a woman
[1:23:03] refused
[1:23:16] and if one cigarette will satisfy that
[1:23:18] nicotine devil
[1:23:20] till he'll leave you alone and quit
[1:23:22] hunting you with one cigarette
[1:23:30] diablo
[1:23:31] nicotine
[1:23:36] and you take a filter
[1:23:38] just lets you one third of that smoke
[1:23:42] through there then
[1:23:44] or one third of that nicotine through
[1:23:47] there
[1:23:47] then it'll take three cigarettes to take
[1:23:50] the place of that one
[1:23:52] and you'll smoke
[1:23:54] three to one
[1:24:14] so one cigarette gives you the nicotine
[1:24:17] that that devil wants for you
[1:24:22] they put a filter and now you gotta
[1:24:24] smoke three
[1:24:26] filters
[1:24:28] then the company sells three instead of
[1:24:30] just one
[1:24:31] company
[1:24:34] i wonder if the government does that to
[1:24:36] us
[1:24:39] here's one
[1:24:41] oh you know what here's the second one
[1:24:45] here's the third one
[1:24:47] oh you know what here's the fourth one
[1:24:51] in in real estate in buenos aires
[1:24:54] we say don't
[1:24:57] don't just
[1:24:59] don't agree
[1:25:00] so a comma agreed to a period
[1:25:10] in real estate we have something called
[1:25:12] a 10-day inspection period
[1:25:19] inspection
[1:25:21] some people will call you and tell you
[1:25:22] hey you know we need so and so fixed
[1:25:31] the rookie realtor will say okay we'll
[1:25:33] do it
[1:26:06] then you make a decision
[1:26:09] a decision but a smart way of doing
[1:26:11] things
[1:26:15] with companies
[1:26:18] yes
[1:26:24] [Music]
[1:26:30] that's how this uh cigarette companies
[1:26:32] put this
[1:26:33] i see publican
[1:26:38] see it's only a scheme to deceive a
[1:26:41] scheme to try to sell you
[1:26:44] try to sell cigarettes foreign
[1:26:53] they can sell more that way than they
[1:26:55] can just
[1:26:57] letting a man smoke a straight tobacco
[1:27:01] in his pipe or in a cigarette now see
[1:27:04] it's of the devil
[1:27:16] diablo as i stood there
[1:27:19] as a stutter looking at it
[1:27:22] a thinking of how deceitful it was the
[1:27:26] question came to me
[1:27:28] and i stood
[1:27:30] back looked at the pack again and i just
[1:27:34] seemed like something said to me but the
[1:27:37] slogan is right
[1:27:39] a thinking man's filter a smoking man
[1:27:42] states
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:28:21] and
[1:28:22] he did and that's that's what the slogan
[1:28:25] that's what the slogan was on that pack
[1:28:27] of cigarettes
[1:28:32] it came to me that that deceitfulness
[1:28:36] also in the natural realm
[1:28:39] there
[1:28:40] in the tobacco is something in order of
[1:28:43] the churches today
[1:28:45] see deceitfulness
[1:29:01] it's come to the whole world
[1:29:03] has become a great deception
[1:29:06] of what is true is really true and
[1:29:10] what's right
[1:29:20] see even in politics
[1:29:23] and in social affair in school and
[1:29:25] everything it becomes a deceitfulness
[1:29:36] does the government really care for you
[1:29:43] that's just me okay
[1:29:45] brother brahm talks about a general
[1:29:48] i'm sorry colonel uh elemono branham
[1:29:52] talks about a colonel that's only
[1:29:54] thinking about himself
[1:29:59] this is a young man this young soldier
[1:30:02] have your name
[1:30:03] sold
[1:30:04] he gets run over by a by a tank
[1:30:08] the poor guy is dying there el porter
[1:30:12] take him to the hospital
[1:30:15] now this poor guy he's a regular guy
[1:30:18] he's a what the what the
[1:30:21] big shots call a nobody
[1:30:26] basically
[1:30:27] important
[1:30:29] he stands in line he's dying there el
[1:30:31] estan filas esperando yeah
[1:30:41] little boy or a little daughter that has
[1:30:43] a rash in the ham
[1:30:55] instead of the young man that's dying
[1:30:58] because he was crushed by a by a
[1:31:06] so i wonder what
[1:31:08] the big shots think about us little
[1:31:10] people it is
[1:31:20] he says if this kernel would have been a
[1:31:22] genuine feeling
[1:31:25] for his brother out there in the line he
[1:31:28] would have said this kid can wait get
[1:31:31] that man up here quickly do something
[1:31:34] for him
[1:31:58] no
[1:31:59] they're not all like that no no no
[1:32:02] but there is too many like that
[1:32:08] there's too many of them that's like
[1:32:10] that exists
[1:32:12] but the man the only thing he was
[1:32:15] thinking of was of his own little boy
[1:32:19] that had a rash on his hands
[1:32:27] not thinking of the poor boy standing
[1:32:29] there mashed under a tank
[1:32:36] the very tank and maybe the very boy
[1:32:39] that would save his life someday in the
[1:32:42] battlefront
[1:32:50] see they don't stop to think only for
[1:32:53] themselves
[1:33:02] let's get into the the church
[1:33:06] and it has to do with the government
[1:33:12] what we just talked about is about the
[1:33:14] government
[1:33:17] about companies
[1:33:33] i looked i looked at it
[1:33:37] and thought it's something like the
[1:33:39] denominations of today
[1:33:42] the churches that we have
[1:33:48] denominations
[1:33:52] each one of them has their own filter
[1:33:54] they have their own type of filter
[1:34:00] they let just that come in that way to
[1:34:05] and what not to come in
[1:34:07] what they filter in and filter out with
[1:34:11] their own kind of a filter
[1:34:21] they just get they just let so much of
[1:34:24] the world get in to satisfy
[1:34:27] the unbelievers
[1:34:28] that's in there
[1:34:30] because the
[1:34:54] but there's one thing about it
[1:34:57] you can't get the church of god like
[1:35:00] that
[1:35:06] not that the
[1:35:07] denominational now i mean the real
[1:35:10] genuine church of god our nola
[1:35:12] denominacion
[1:35:38] man has always looked for someone or
[1:35:41] something he could worship
[1:35:47] all through history man has tried to
[1:35:49] worship someone or something
[1:35:55] he knows that there's something out
[1:35:56] there
[1:35:59] on 62
[1:36:01] line 62.
[1:36:03] so the human being no matter how fallen
[1:36:06] he is he still knows there's something
[1:36:09] somewhere
[1:36:13] else
[1:36:17] but he's got such a taste of the world
[1:36:19] that he cannot take the correct filter
[1:36:22] he has to have his own man-made filter
[1:36:26] each one making their own kind of
[1:36:29] filters
[1:36:47] as i spoke this morning and last sunday
[1:36:50] morning on that wheel in the middle of
[1:36:53] the wheel
[1:36:55] or that little inside soul
[1:36:59] on the inside of the spirit
[1:37:02] yellow ultimate
[1:37:13] how the spirit on the inside between the
[1:37:16] soul and the body can be absol
[1:37:20] can be absolutely anointed with the
[1:37:23] holiest ghost
[1:37:24] did you understand that
[1:37:31] absolutely
[1:37:35] how to follow that
[1:37:38] in the in with the continuity
[1:37:41] of the message
[1:37:43] the god of this world the anointed ones
[1:37:46] in the last days that outside that
[1:37:49] middle circle that first circle
[1:37:53] is the is a human census a second
[1:37:58] circle
[1:37:59] is the spirit census
[1:38:01] will sell
[1:38:03] will
[1:38:04] self-will desire and so forth but the
[1:38:07] inside
[1:38:09] is the soul
[1:38:10] the soul that was pre-destinated
[1:38:40] so they can anoint the spirit to make
[1:38:43] the outside body
[1:38:45] come in subjection to the spirit
[1:38:48] but the soul that sinneth that soul
[1:38:51] shall die
[1:38:52] the soul that rejects in
[1:38:56] unbelief
[1:38:58] the word of god
[1:39:00] which it is a part of
[1:39:03] that soul shall
[1:39:04] eternally
[1:39:07] has always has
[1:39:23] is
[1:39:31] ezekiel 18 20.
[1:39:36] i believe in an eternal death
[1:39:42] same as i believe in an eternal heaven
[1:39:47] but not an internal hell but
[1:39:50] there's no such a thing as eternal hell
[1:39:55] there's an eternal death for people that
[1:39:57] are many of them religious in the world
[1:40:02] today has always been dead
[1:40:13] many of them religious
[1:40:16] in the world today
[1:40:18] has always been dead muchos
[1:40:26] the woman that lives in pleasure with
[1:40:28] her bobbed hair and painted face is dead
[1:40:31] while she is alive
[1:40:41] she may be religious but she never was
[1:40:44] saying
[1:40:48] she's got an outward motion
[1:40:52] for afuera she might sing in the choir
[1:40:54] or she might dance in the spirit she
[1:40:56] might speak in tongues and have all the
[1:40:59] manifestations of the spirit
[1:41:11] but unless the soul
[1:41:13] on the inside
[1:41:15] is of god's daughter see she is gone no
[1:41:19] matter what she does
[1:41:30] first timothy 5'6 but she
[1:41:34] that liveth and pleasure is dead while
[1:41:36] she living
[1:41:44] you ever wonder why brother branham
[1:41:46] always said bob hair and painted face
[1:41:53] always said something else
[1:41:58] here but
[1:42:27] i wonder why brother abraham said
[1:42:29] painted face
[1:42:33] painting pets you go all the way back to
[1:42:35] jezebel
[1:42:40] what's
[1:42:53] to impress something or someone but uh
[1:42:55] impressionara alien or algo so you might
[1:42:58] say uh
[1:43:00] bob here us
[1:43:03] the style of the people el estilo del
[1:43:06] pueblo and uh
[1:43:36] is there while she lives
[1:43:39] that's just me
[1:43:42] it says the woman that liveth in
[1:43:44] pleasure with her bobbed hair and
[1:43:46] painted face is dead while she lives
[1:44:03] but she was never saved
[1:44:10] she might sing in the choir she might
[1:44:12] dance in the spirit
[1:44:17] she might speak in tongues and have all
[1:44:20] manifestations of the spirit
[1:44:27] but unless that soul on the inside is
[1:44:31] god's daughter
[1:44:33] see she's gone no matter what she does
[1:44:42] is
[1:44:48] hey man i'm in
[1:44:50] we're almost done yeah
[1:45:00] brother brown says uh
[1:45:03] on um
[1:45:06] the serpent's seed
[1:45:10] i don't think i have that one up there
[1:45:13] oh yes i do
[1:45:15] so look here
[1:45:17] if their mother was a chorus girl
[1:45:20] and their
[1:45:22] grandmother
[1:45:24] and her mother was a flapper
[1:45:27] what she's today a rock and roll
[1:45:30] striptease
[1:45:32] what's her children going to be
[1:45:38] is
[1:45:51] when you're born of the spirit of god
[1:45:54] then you've got a you you are a son of
[1:45:58] god and you always was a son of god and
[1:46:02] you always will be a son of god
[1:46:09] you see
[1:46:14] no way to separate it because it's you
[1:46:16] have eternal life and eternal never did
[1:46:19] begin never will it end
[1:46:23] up
[1:46:31] this is a
[1:46:32] this next part
[1:46:36] i like this next part
[1:46:56] oh for the grace of god
[1:46:59] that he would give us understanding
[1:47:02] of such great mysteries
[1:47:10] as paul spoke here
[1:47:13] further on down in ephesians speaking of
[1:47:16] the husband and wife and said
[1:47:20] this is a mystery
[1:47:23] how the woman should
[1:47:25] re should
[1:47:27] be in respect to her husband
[1:47:34] is mysterious
[1:47:53] even the second place i believe it is
[1:47:57] the entire bible
[1:48:00] that reverence was ever spoken to said
[1:48:04] the woman
[1:48:06] seeing she reverenced her husband
[1:48:09] reverence her husband
[1:48:15] questioned
[1:48:27] i think those are fighting words for
[1:48:29] today's world
[1:48:44] then a husband ought to live such a life
[1:48:49] before his wife
[1:48:52] that his wife could reverence him as a
[1:48:56] son of god and
[1:48:58] esposito
[1:49:11] and if he doesn't live that kind of life
[1:49:14] well then of course
[1:49:17] she wouldn't reverse him
[1:49:19] because she knows
[1:49:21] what he's made of
[1:49:24] classes
[1:49:33] but when it's a man
[1:49:36] that is reverent man
[1:49:38] reverent and clean with his wife
[1:49:42] and before his family
[1:49:45] a real servant of god
[1:49:48] then the woman
[1:49:50] children and all should respect that
[1:49:53] servant of god with
[1:50:33] that is tremendous right there is
[1:50:38] when any of those items gets out of
[1:50:42] sequence
[1:50:46] there's enough balance there and this
[1:50:48] existing library
[1:50:52] the other way around if there's another
[1:50:54] different
[1:50:56] item in that family
[1:51:03] there's problems
[1:51:04] with
[1:51:18] now notice
[1:51:20] women
[1:51:21] they want to have bobbed hair they want
[1:51:24] to wear shorts pants makeup these little
[1:51:28] bikinis and things that
[1:51:30] they
[1:51:31] they wear nowadays they want to do it
[1:51:34] and yet want to go to church you see the
[1:51:37] anointing on the spirit and not about
[1:51:40] not upon the soul
[1:51:46] yes
[1:52:03] see that that's a lot that's a mouthful
[1:52:06] right there but it says
[1:52:08] you have the body
[1:52:11] you have the anointing on the spirit
[1:52:14] sorel
[1:52:29] the soul is where you have to be worried
[1:52:32] about
[1:52:35] if the spirit of god is in that soul
[1:52:40] then the spirit will do the word of god
[1:52:46] amen amen you have the body the spirit
[1:52:49] anointing of god or of the devil
[1:52:56] and the soul has to be
[1:52:58] of god
[1:53:01] now that's why you must be born again
[1:53:05] if you're not born again
[1:53:08] then you're just in the spirit entonces
[1:53:10] solo stats
[1:53:24] but you need to
[1:53:34] so you cannot have to worry about
[1:53:36] whether or not you're going to do this
[1:53:37] or whether or not you're going to do
[1:53:38] that
[1:53:41] you do it by nature
[1:53:45] god is in the soul
[1:53:48] amen
[1:53:55] 75.
[1:53:58] so it wants to be a christian and also
[1:54:01] do these things
[1:54:03] and the pastor says it's okay
[1:54:13] then
[1:54:14] if he says it's okay you can
[1:54:17] be a member your name can be
[1:54:20] on my church book here it's okay then he
[1:54:24] is giving you his denominational filter
[1:54:29] to suit a worldly woman's taste
[1:54:32] is
[1:54:49] she loves the world she likes the taste
[1:54:52] of it so he's got a filter for her but
[1:54:56] she's a long ways from being a thinking
[1:54:59] woman
[1:55:00] but there you are
[1:55:02] that's where i found this text
[1:55:19] no 76 no no
[1:55:22] she isn't a thinking woman if she was a
[1:55:25] thinking
[1:55:27] she would know the church isn't going to
[1:55:30] judge her
[1:55:31] at the last day the church
[1:55:34] is judging her now by her membership
[1:55:38] her loyalty to the circles that she
[1:55:41] belongs to and the societies
[1:56:04] they are judging her now by that but god
[1:56:08] is going to judge her at the last day
[1:56:12] so
[1:56:26] we're almost done here yeah
[1:56:29] my candy's gone now
[1:56:31] yes
[1:56:32] so uh just a couple of things just to
[1:56:35] just to
[1:56:36] nail down about a thinker
[1:56:39] in amazon
[1:56:47] now if there is a theological filter for
[1:56:50] the theological thinker
[1:56:52] and there is a church filter for a
[1:56:56] church thinker
[1:56:57] a cigarette filter for a cigarette
[1:57:01] thinker there's got to be a real
[1:57:05] filter
[1:57:06] somewhere for the real thinker
[1:57:31] and god
[1:57:32] has a filter
[1:57:34] and that's his word
[1:57:37] it's a separator it for it's a the
[1:57:41] waters of separation for sin
[1:57:45] no
[1:57:45] that's the thinking man or the holy
[1:57:48] man's taste
[1:57:50] all right
[1:58:05] i want to be a thinking man
[1:58:08] to think who i am
[1:58:10] who i'm going to stand by
[1:58:13] one of these days for judgment
[1:58:24] who am i going to stand by
[1:58:30] one of these days for judgment
[1:58:41] i want to stand on the right side
[1:58:45] of the
[1:58:49] 121 when you come to this world
[1:58:52] you are born in sin you don't even come
[1:58:54] with a fighting chance you were born in
[1:58:57] sin shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:59:00] speaking lies within your own spirit you
[1:59:02] deserve
[1:59:04] you you the desire of sin the lover of
[1:59:08] sin because you were born in sin you
[1:59:10] didn't even have a chance
[1:59:37] don't think this is on there but
[1:59:39] but down inside of you
[1:59:42] somewhere
[1:59:43] here you come there was something in
[1:59:46] there
[1:59:47] that began to draw
[1:59:50] bro
[1:59:56] if you note it was something that told
[1:59:59] you there was a god somewhere
[2:00:02] and you read his word
[2:00:13] then you took the church you took their
[2:00:15] ideas when you was told better
[2:00:18] then you never used a thinking man's
[2:00:21] filter
[2:00:23] entonces
[2:00:24] glacier tomorrow
[2:00:32] but when you use god's filter which is a
[2:00:36] thinking man's filter because all other
[2:00:39] filters will pass away but mine shall
[2:00:42] not
[2:00:43] recon
[2:00:53] and when you take god's filter you draw
[2:00:55] your life your desires if you draw your
[2:00:58] desires through god's filter a thinking
[2:01:01] man's filter there is nothing but god
[2:01:05] there's nothing left
[2:01:23] now if you want the evidence of the holy
[2:01:25] ghost there it is
[2:01:30] when that soul of yours will line with
[2:01:33] the word of god in every respect
[2:01:43] it shows you've drawn your life through
[2:01:46] a thinking man's filter
[2:01:48] god's
[2:02:01] m
[2:02:04] just got a couple more here
[2:02:07] 178.
[2:02:11] now if you are a thinking people tonight
[2:02:15] here and out in the land where the
[2:02:17] message is going your desire will be a
[2:02:21] bible taste not a denominational taste
[2:02:26] for you will be judged by the very bible
[2:02:31] the word that i'm asking you to filter
[2:02:34] your soul through
[2:02:37] hours
[2:02:57] i'm asking you to filter your soul
[2:03:01] through and to reject one word of it and
[2:03:06] not let your soul pass through the word
[2:03:09] you'll be turned down
[2:03:25] not live by bread alone but by every
[2:03:28] word that proceeded off of the mouth of
[2:03:30] god
[2:03:37] it will be brought into you
[2:03:39] predestinated
[2:03:41] and when the lord breathes upon you his
[2:03:45] spirit will quicken that word to a
[2:03:48] reality and you'll see that jesus christ
[2:03:51] is the same yesterday today in pereira
[2:04:06] the word if you are predestinated you
[2:04:10] see it there's no way to hide it from
[2:04:12] you you look
[2:04:14] there and say why
[2:04:17] it's just so plain for me
[2:04:19] so plain before my face
[2:04:22] i look at it there it is
[2:04:40] i'm look at i'm looking right at it
[2:04:43] i see it here it is the word every word
[2:04:47] just word by word living out
[2:04:51] then there's a state of eternal life
[2:04:55] that you want
[2:04:57] to direct
[2:05:10] and when you breathe through that
[2:05:12] what can come through that
[2:05:15] god's filter
[2:05:17] nothing but the spirit
[2:05:19] no world at all no unbelief at all is
[2:05:23] god's filter and when you breathe
[2:05:26] through that nothing can get through
[2:05:29] that but the holy ghost
[2:05:52] now you got the evidence of the holy
[2:05:54] ghost see
[2:05:56] a holy man
[2:05:58] or a woman's taste
[2:06:00] they want to live
[2:06:02] they got eternal life and because this
[2:06:06] word is quickened
[2:06:08] to them
[2:06:09] they live
[2:06:10] a thinking man's filter and a holy man's
[2:06:13] taste auras
[2:06:43] father celestial
[2:06:45] thank you lord for the message of the
[2:06:48] hour lord
