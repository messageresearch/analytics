[1:03:56] 1 and verse
[1:04:02] 37 and this morning we're going to
[1:04:04] continue on the thought that we've
[1:04:05] brought
[1:04:08] forth he that have an ear let him
[1:04:11] here and as a
[1:04:15] subtitle the mind is the
[1:04:17] womb
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:23] 137
[1:04:26] for with God nothing shall be
[1:04:30] impossible how many of you brought your
[1:04:32] Bibles
[1:04:34] today we're going to read it together in
[1:04:36] Spanish and then in
[1:04:44] English okay let's do it in English for
[1:04:47] with God for with God nothing shall be
[1:04:50] impossible nothing shall be impossible
[1:04:53] amen let us
[1:04:56] pray our heavenly
[1:04:58] father we're here this
[1:05:02] morning Lord finishing up another
[1:05:05] year and coming into a new
[1:05:10] year Lord Nobody Knows the day nor the
[1:05:14] hour but Lord Jesus
[1:05:17] Christ give us the
[1:05:19] strength give us the
[1:05:21] grace so that when you do arrive
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:27] that you may find us doing your
[1:05:30] will loving one
[1:05:33] another that you may find your
[1:05:36] bride dressed with your
[1:05:38] word help us
[1:05:41] father as we go reading your
[1:05:44] word vindicate your
[1:05:47] word and open up the
[1:05:49] ears and the
[1:05:52] hearts and help us to be able to
[1:05:54] surrender
[1:05:56] ourselves for we place all these things
[1:05:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:02] amen you may be
[1:06:05] seated I want to thank the
[1:06:10] musicians he that have an ear let him
[1:06:13] hear and the mind is the
[1:06:21] womb and the prophet mentions this and
[1:06:24] various
[1:06:27] messages in uh the
[1:06:33] womb it says that the womb of the
[1:06:38] Earth the womb of the
[1:06:41] church the womb of the
[1:06:44] mind and the womb of the
[1:06:48] heart so when we say the womb it's
[1:06:52] also or in Spanish
[1:06:55] is going to be a little bit
[1:06:59] different but what I've found or come to
[1:07:01] realize what the prophet speaks about
[1:07:03] the
[1:07:05] womb is that the Earth has a
[1:07:08] womb the church has a
[1:07:11] womb and the mind has a
[1:07:16] womb in the same man the heart also has
[1:07:18] a womb
[1:07:22] um and and in this morning we're going
[1:07:24] to be speaking about the
[1:07:30] mind sometimes we confuse the mind with
[1:07:33] our
[1:07:35] brain but the prophet says that the
[1:07:38] brain there you find no
[1:07:43] intelligence and it's in reality your
[1:07:45] spirit that's within
[1:07:48] you your intelligence is found in your
[1:07:52] spirit
[1:07:55] and your brain is just a bunch of cells
[1:07:58] and and uh
[1:08:02] materials but it has no intelligence
[1:08:05] within
[1:08:06] itself it's your
[1:08:10] spirit and the prophet also says that
[1:08:12] the
[1:08:13] soul is the nature of the
[1:08:17] spirit and the prophet says like
[1:08:20] this the
[1:08:22] spirit controls
[1:08:24] the
[1:08:28] body so when a person has a physical
[1:08:34] action that represents what's within the
[1:08:39] spirit because the spirit controls the
[1:08:43] body and the scripture says that the
[1:08:45] mind that was in
[1:08:47] Christ be in
[1:08:51] you so then when we say mind
[1:08:54] we're talking about the
[1:08:57] spirit now we're saying the mind that
[1:08:59] was in
[1:09:02] Christ so in other words that the spirit
[1:09:04] that was within
[1:09:05] Christ be in
[1:09:08] you because the
[1:09:10] mind is the control
[1:09:14] tower and that is what directs
[1:09:17] us and the prophet also
[1:09:20] says that there is a great battle
[1:09:26] and it's the greatest battle that was
[1:09:27] ever
[1:09:29] fought and where is that
[1:09:31] battle can anybody tell
[1:09:36] me where in
[1:09:39] China okay in the
[1:09:42] mind sorry I'm I'm just a bit far off of
[1:09:45] from
[1:09:46] you and it says
[1:09:48] that so then the greatest
[1:09:51] battle is within the mind
[1:09:56] and just as we say that the
[1:09:59] mind a
[1:10:01] womb
[1:10:06] amen how many of you remember that back
[1:10:08] in the Book of
[1:10:11] Genesis when Abraham and
[1:10:15] Sarah coming up to a certain point in
[1:10:17] their
[1:10:21] lives they had received the Lord and the
[1:10:24] two
[1:10:29] angels and the prophet says that they
[1:10:31] had turned young
[1:10:33] again how many of you remember that
[1:10:35] story that's what the prophet
[1:10:38] says so if you go to Genesis
[1:10:42] 20 now Abraham and S and
[1:10:46] Sarah they go into a uh
[1:10:51] Kingdom which is called Gerard
[1:10:56] and the king of that
[1:10:59] kingdom was the king
[1:11:01] amalec a very young
[1:11:04] king and when he came onto
[1:11:07] Sarah he got fell in love with
[1:11:16] Sarah and so when they came into the
[1:11:18] city Abraham told Sarah to say that he
[1:11:21] is uh his sister
[1:11:24] who is
[1:11:25] Abraham a
[1:11:32] prophet so the Lord and the two angels
[1:11:35] came unto Abraham beforehand and still
[1:11:37] he decided to
[1:11:43] lie and just like we say it it's just a
[1:11:46] little small white
[1:11:49] lie and AMC said why did you lie to
[1:11:52] me well in reality she is my
[1:11:56] sister from my father's side but not
[1:11:59] from my mother's
[1:12:04] side so he did lie but he twisted the
[1:12:07] truth a little bit and it became a what
[1:12:08] we call a white
[1:12:11] Li so then the Lord talked to AMC in a
[1:12:15] dream and he said you're just as good as
[1:12:17] a dead
[1:12:19] man restore that man his
[1:12:22] wife
[1:12:24] but he told me that it was a
[1:12:27] sister and you know my heart and you
[1:12:29] know my
[1:12:34] works and that's the reason why I come
[1:12:36] and stop you so that you don't sin
[1:12:38] against
[1:12:39] me and if you
[1:12:44] remember that the Lord closed up all the
[1:12:47] woms of the
[1:12:48] Kingdom I hope that you're following
[1:12:51] me I'm going to go a little bit
[1:12:54] slow but even
[1:12:57] God closed the
[1:12:59] Ws all of the
[1:13:01] Ws of the kingdom of
[1:13:04] AMC so that no life should bring
[1:13:07] forth how many of you remember that
[1:13:11] amen it's in Genesis
[1:13:13] 20 now the
[1:13:16] mind is the door to the
[1:13:21] spirit and that's where we find
[1:13:23] uh the battle the
[1:13:27] battle and it's in the
[1:13:32] mind and then if you can help me with
[1:13:34] the
[1:13:35] slides and Prophet says like
[1:13:38] this these
[1:13:42] battles has raged since the day of the
[1:13:44] Garden of
[1:13:47] Eden the battle in the human
[1:13:51] mind Satan started it
[1:13:56] what did he do when he met
[1:14:00] Eve he didn't deny God's
[1:14:04] word but he whitewashed
[1:14:07] it so then the devil or the
[1:14:10] serpent he never denied the
[1:14:14] word but only whitewashed
[1:14:19] it he stopped up some of those little
[1:14:22] channels here so uh here
[1:14:26] somewhere so then when Satan came
[1:14:29] to he used his
[1:14:32] words and began to talk to
[1:14:36] her and he said so God has
[1:14:40] said so God has said this in his
[1:14:46] word so then the serpent never denied
[1:14:48] what was written in the
[1:14:50] word but only Twisted it or whitewashed
[1:14:52] it
[1:14:55] and then the prophet says
[1:14:58] like he know the word was
[1:15:05] right but he know he couldn't just come
[1:15:08] right out and blast it out blur it like
[1:15:13] that or BL yeah blast it out or blur it
[1:15:17] like
[1:15:18] that but he sugarcoated
[1:15:21] it so
[1:15:23] the serpent came to
[1:15:25] Eve came into the Garden of
[1:15:29] Eden he never denied or used the
[1:15:31] different type Bible he didn't use the
[1:15:34] Mormon
[1:15:35] bible or the
[1:15:37] Quran he used the written
[1:15:41] word so God has said
[1:15:44] this but also in his word he
[1:15:47] says but by Grace you are
[1:15:51] saved so then you can do what whatever
[1:15:53] you
[1:15:54] want because here in this
[1:15:57] Bible that you're saved by
[1:16:00] grace so then you can live any style of
[1:16:03] life that you want
[1:16:06] Satan he only sugarcoated the word of
[1:16:12] God and so then Eve accepted the
[1:16:14] incorrect
[1:16:16] word and so the prophet
[1:16:19] says now the
[1:16:22] womb eeve
[1:16:26] received the wrong seed
[1:16:31] word so then there's more
[1:16:35] seed there's not just the the seed of
[1:16:39] God but we also have the serpent
[1:16:44] seed so then now we've got to be really
[1:16:49] careful because Satan also uses the same
[1:16:52] word
[1:16:56] and he knows how to preach a very
[1:16:57] beautiful
[1:17:01] message so then Eve received the wrong
[1:17:04] seed
[1:17:07] word and now the prophet says now listen
[1:17:09] real close
[1:17:12] now we're going to drive it down now if
[1:17:15] the Lord
[1:17:18] willing she received the wrong word what
[1:17:21] did it do
[1:17:25] it was Satan's
[1:17:27] lie because in uh John 4:48 844
[1:17:33] 8:44 the scripture says that he is the
[1:17:36] father of Lies what is a
[1:17:43] lie a is I'm
[1:17:48] sorry 1% truth a lie isn't just a 1%
[1:17:52] truth
[1:17:55] and
[1:17:56] 99.9 a lie a
[1:18:01] lie is a 99.9% of
[1:18:04] Truth with a 1% of a
[1:18:07] lie that's a
[1:18:11] lie a lie has the
[1:18:15] truth so then when the Devil
[1:18:17] Comes brings his
[1:18:20] lie which he is the father of
[1:18:24] lies he twists the
[1:18:27] word so then the prophet says like
[1:18:32] this that the serpent wanted the womb
[1:18:36] the mind of Eve
[1:18:39] why because the mind is a
[1:18:43] womb and in the
[1:18:45] womb you find the
[1:18:48] intelligence the intelligence is not in
[1:18:50] the
[1:18:51] brain
[1:18:53] the intelligence is within the
[1:18:57] spirit because if he could control that
[1:19:00] mind he could control the
[1:19:03] body and everything comes by one
[1:19:10] word the word comes out of the
[1:19:12] mouth comes in through an ear and comes
[1:19:15] in through the
[1:19:19] mind so then that word is is just
[1:19:22] sounding in the mind
[1:19:24] no that message is too
[1:19:26] hard or you could
[1:19:29] say that message was the
[1:19:33] truth and each and every one person has
[1:19:35] a free moral
[1:19:37] agenc the message is being
[1:19:41] preached the message is being brought
[1:19:43] out from the mouth of
[1:19:45] God and then it goes into the ear of
[1:19:47] each and every one of you and then where
[1:19:50] does it go to your mind
[1:19:53] and then within your mind you can
[1:19:57] say because when the seed
[1:19:59] comes goes on to every channel to your
[1:20:06] reasoning then you might say no this
[1:20:07] church is a bit harsh when they
[1:20:11] preach or you could say this is nothing
[1:20:13] but the
[1:20:14] truth and you have the right to
[1:20:19] decide because the seed is the word of
[1:20:21] God
[1:20:24] and it's being spread forth on the
[1:20:26] earth on some in Good
[1:20:30] Grounds and in other grounds where it
[1:20:32] does not fall on Good
[1:20:37] Grounds and so when Eve received the
[1:20:40] wrong
[1:20:41] word well the message of the
[1:20:48] serpent there came and she conceived the
[1:20:51] uh SE of serpent
[1:20:55] and the prophet preaches it a little bit
[1:20:57] more
[1:21:00] harshen
[1:21:02] word in the message the spoken word is
[1:21:05] the Original
[1:21:06] Seed it says that first of
[1:21:09] all
[1:21:11] Satan has to conquer the
[1:21:15] mind just like the when the young
[1:21:18] man wants to go and and conquer the
[1:21:21] young lady he first has to go through
[1:21:24] her
[1:21:26] mind and then the Act was
[1:21:28] done but first of
[1:21:33] all that devil had to First conquer the
[1:21:36] mind tell her very beautiful
[1:21:39] things telling her this that and the
[1:21:42] other in order to be able
[1:21:45] to conquer her mind but first it's the
[1:21:49] mind now if you go into the Book of
[1:21:51] Luke to chapter
[1:21:56] 1 we're going to go on to verse
[1:22:02] 28 this is the part where uh Virgin
[1:22:07] Mary meets with uh the angel angel
[1:22:11] Gabriel Angel
[1:22:14] Gabriel and the Bible says like this on
[1:22:16] verse
[1:22:21] 28
[1:22:26] and the angel came in unto her and said
[1:22:28] hail Thou Art Thou highly favored the
[1:22:31] Lord is with thee blessed art thou among
[1:22:36] women so then we find out that there is
[1:22:38] this young lady here by the name of
[1:22:44] Mary it wasn't that there was just only
[1:22:46] maybe five or 10 young ladies City but
[1:22:49] there were so many of
[1:22:51] them
[1:22:53] but there was only one of
[1:22:57] them there was only one that separated
[1:22:59] herself from the
[1:23:02] world and dedicated herself to the
[1:23:05] service of the
[1:23:07] Lord and I believe that this was a very
[1:23:09] tremendous young
[1:23:12] lady for the angel to come down and
[1:23:14] speak with
[1:23:18] her and he said that uh thou are highly
[1:23:21] favored
[1:23:25] and then we see on verse
[1:23:32] 29 and when she saw him she was troubled
[1:23:35] at his saying and cast in her mind uh
[1:23:38] what manner of salutation this should
[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:45] be and the angel said don't don't
[1:23:47] trouble
[1:23:48] yourself fear
[1:23:51] not for thou Hast found favor with
[1:23:55] God because there was a
[1:23:58] prophecy that a virgin shall
[1:24:03] conceive and that's something that's way
[1:24:06] Supernatural and then the angel told
[1:24:10] her and now you shall conceive in your
[1:24:13] womb and shall bring
[1:24:16] forth a
[1:24:18] son and shall call his name Jesus
[1:24:26] so then we see that the angel came unto
[1:24:29] Mary and said that you shall conceive
[1:24:32] within your
[1:24:34] womb so then she heard the words of this
[1:24:40] Angel and then in her mind she began to
[1:24:45] reason and in her mind she could have
[1:24:47] said I rejected or I accept
[1:24:51] it I deny it or I accept
[1:24:55] it so then we go on to verse
[1:25:01] 34 said Mary unto the angel how shall
[1:25:03] this be seeing that I know no
[1:25:08] man and so in her mind she only thought
[1:25:11] that she could conceive a
[1:25:13] son when there is a man and a
[1:25:16] woman but for
[1:25:19] God nothing impossible for God
[1:25:23] he is the
[1:25:26] supernatural he's not only in the
[1:25:32] natural so then we see that Mary said on
[1:25:34] verse
[1:25:37] 38 we see that she heard the message of
[1:25:39] the
[1:25:41] Angel and then within her mind she
[1:25:44] decied to either accept or reject that
[1:25:47] message
[1:25:48] of and what did Mary
[1:25:51] say
[1:25:53] uh behold the handmade of the
[1:25:56] Lord she didn't say no no no I don't
[1:25:59] want to accept
[1:26:00] that she said be it unto
[1:26:03] me according to Thy
[1:26:07] word to Thy
[1:26:09] word
[1:26:12] amen sometimes I feel like
[1:26:18] running and so then when we see that
[1:26:20] Mary accepted the message of the
[1:26:23] after
[1:26:25] listening after accepting it within her
[1:26:28] mind and then it came down to the womb
[1:26:31] of her
[1:26:32] body and then it began to
[1:26:35] show that she had Emmanuel within
[1:26:40] her Elizabeth and then she came across
[1:26:43] her cousin
[1:26:47] Elizabeth and she also conceived and had
[1:26:50] what who was called John the Baptist
[1:26:54] a man that was anointed by the spirit of
[1:27:00] Elias but the scripture says that John
[1:27:03] never moved within the womb of her
[1:27:08] mother it was just a stillborn
[1:27:12] baby and that really worried
[1:27:17] Elizabeth so then Mary goes on to
[1:27:20] Elizabeth and and just with the
[1:27:23] greeting that's what the Bible says with
[1:27:26] the
[1:27:28] greeting the Lord bless you
[1:27:30] Elizabeth let me tell you what happened
[1:27:34] to
[1:27:35] me the angel Gabriel came unto me and
[1:27:38] told
[1:27:41] me that I'm going to conceive a child by
[1:27:44] the name of
[1:27:46] Jesus you should be the most high the
[1:27:48] child of
[1:27:50] God so then with that greeting
[1:27:53] with those
[1:27:54] words the Bible tells
[1:27:56] us that Elizabeth
[1:27:58] heard that
[1:28:01] greeting he that have an ear let him
[1:28:04] hear she
[1:28:06] heard the simple greeting of
[1:28:09] Mary and with that the Bible tells
[1:28:14] us that she received the Holy
[1:28:20] Ghost that John began to move within the
[1:28:22] womb of
[1:28:27] Elizabeth and then the Elizabeth says
[1:28:29] that why is it that the mother of the
[1:28:31] Lord comes unto me that's what the Bible
[1:28:34] says verse
[1:28:37] 48 because the
[1:28:39] word always comes to the
[1:28:43] prophet even in the
[1:28:46] womb Jesus Christ
[1:28:48] came to John the
[1:28:50] Baptist because the word
[1:28:54] always comes to the
[1:29:00] prophet John the Baptist was six months
[1:29:02] older than Jesus
[1:29:05] Christ oh how we would want to preach
[1:29:07] about
[1:29:10] that even with the simple greeting
[1:29:13] Elizabeth Elizabeth heard that
[1:29:16] GRE and she received the Holy
[1:29:19] Ghost and then John began to move
[1:29:23] and the prophet tells
[1:29:30] us uh which
[1:29:33] one he is not here with a Shar
[1:29:39] uh look how well dressed she
[1:29:43] is uh sufficient enough to be able to
[1:29:46] deceive Luther El Luther the stock
[1:29:49] Wesley La Wesley the tassel
[1:29:53] Mary the
[1:29:55] shock uh the prophet says the
[1:29:58] shock the womb or
[1:30:03] Pentecost so then Mary typified three
[1:30:06] things the shook the womb or
[1:30:11] Pentecost what's the
[1:30:14] sh the shu is what grabs or or is
[1:30:18] hugging the the seed the
[1:30:20] seed it's not the
[1:30:23] grain but
[1:30:25] it's it takes care of it
[1:30:30] amen because when Jesus was in
[1:30:33] Mary she took care of
[1:30:37] him when the time comes when that seed
[1:30:40] is ready to sprout it releases the seed
[1:30:47] amen because a woman is not pregnant for
[1:30:50] 24 months
[1:30:54] because there comes a time where the
[1:30:55] baby matures to the point that it comes
[1:30:57] out and the same thing with
[1:31:02] Pentecost and then in the other message
[1:31:04] the things that are to
[1:31:10] be finally those words of God Anchored
[1:31:13] In the Womb of the
[1:31:16] Virgin and she conceived and brought
[1:31:18] forth
[1:31:20] Emanuel so then she heard the word of
[1:31:22] the Lord it came into her
[1:31:26] mind and then she made up her mind of
[1:31:28] either to accept it or reject
[1:31:31] it and she said be it unto me according
[1:31:33] to th
[1:31:35] word even though it might have sound
[1:31:41] ridiculous even though it might have
[1:31:42] sounded extraordinary or out of
[1:31:45] this but she had accepted the
[1:31:48] word and when she accepted the word it
[1:31:52] fell down into her
[1:31:54] room and she conceived
[1:31:57] Emanuel and we also have a
[1:32:01] womb and we're listening to the
[1:32:05] word and so this morning you could
[1:32:07] either accepted or
[1:32:09] rejected Mary is the shook the
[1:32:13] womb
[1:32:16] Pentecost but she is not the
[1:32:18] seed she is not the grain
[1:32:24] because Pentecost that's where they
[1:32:26] stayed they thought that that was the
[1:32:29] grain the Catholics with all due
[1:32:33] respect they believe that it's Virgin
[1:32:35] Mary
[1:32:36] Virg but it's not the Virgin
[1:32:39] Mary it's the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:32:43] came out of
[1:32:45] her but there were many that just stayed
[1:32:47] with vir the mared
[1:32:50] Virgin but it was only a borrowed
[1:32:57] womb and then we see that even Mary the
[1:33:01] prophet says it this way that she denied
[1:33:03] the
[1:33:04] word now when Jesus was 12 years
[1:33:14] old teaching those great
[1:33:17] Masters and Joseph and Mary
[1:33:20] left
[1:33:23] Pentecost they had left the gra they
[1:33:26] rejected
[1:33:27] him and then they came
[1:33:30] back and they said we've been looking
[1:33:32] for
[1:33:33] you your father and
[1:33:36] I and Jesus
[1:33:39] said know you not that I must be about
[1:33:41] my father's
[1:33:45] business Joseph and Mary were not his
[1:33:50] parents the father is the word the Holy
[1:33:55] Ghost so then she herself denied the
[1:33:58] word and that's what the word says in
[1:34:00] the
[1:34:02] prophet and then in Romans
[1:34:06] 10:17 says that faith comes by
[1:34:09] hearing and the hearing of the word of
[1:34:11] of the
[1:34:12] Lord we're going to go into
[1:34:16] Galatians I hope you brought your swords
[1:34:18] with you this
[1:34:20] morning and Ians
[1:34:25] 3 Galatians
[1:34:32] 32 here the Apostle Paul it's almost
[1:34:35] like Apostle Paul is kind of scolding
[1:34:38] the
[1:34:40] Galatians because in the first verse it
[1:34:42] says oh foolish
[1:34:45] Galatians but in the second verse it it
[1:34:47] reads like
[1:34:49] this and very clearly it says it here in
[1:34:53] Spanish this only would I learn of
[1:34:59] you and pro the Apostle says I just want
[1:35:02] to know one simple
[1:35:06] thing did you receive the Spirit by The
[1:35:08] Works of the
[1:35:09] law or by hearing of
[1:35:13] Faith so did you receive the Holy Ghost
[1:35:17] by
[1:35:18] works or by hearing the word of God
[1:35:23] how did Mary receive Jesus
[1:35:26] Christ listening to the message of the
[1:35:30] messenger and I hope you're following
[1:35:32] [Music]
[1:35:33] me how did Mary
[1:35:35] receive by
[1:35:37] hearing the message of the
[1:35:41] messenger and Paul said I just want to
[1:35:43] know one simple
[1:35:45] thing he's kind of scolding the the
[1:35:47] Galatians by
[1:35:50] works because you think you can do this
[1:35:52] and
[1:35:54] that or by hearing by
[1:35:56] faith and verse
[1:36:06] five he therefore that ministereth to
[1:36:09] you the spirit and worketh miracles
[1:36:11] among you does it he do do he it by The
[1:36:16] Works of the law or by hearing of
[1:36:19] Faith so then how is it that we receive
[1:36:22] by
[1:36:23] hearing by hearing the word of
[1:36:26] God so how do receive the Holy Ghost by
[1:36:29] hearing the
[1:36:31] word and it is very important that we
[1:36:34] listen to the
[1:36:35] word now we're going to go over to the
[1:36:37] Book of Mark Mark 7
[1:36:43] 14 and here we're going to be doing a
[1:36:45] bit of a Diagnostics in the heart of
[1:36:50] man
[1:36:53] here the Lord Jesus Christ is talking to
[1:36:54] his disciples and the
[1:36:57] Pharisees and he read and it reads like
[1:36:59] this on
[1:37:05] 7:14 and when he had called the all the
[1:37:07] people unto him he said unto them
[1:37:09] hearken unto me every one of you and
[1:37:13] understand what does Jesus say he says
[1:37:15] listen or
[1:37:20] hearken there is nothing from without a
[1:37:23] man that entereth into him that can
[1:37:25] defile
[1:37:27] him so then Jesus is saying it very
[1:37:31] there's nothing
[1:37:33] outside that can contaminate
[1:37:37] man but the things which come out of
[1:37:41] him those are the are they that defile
[1:37:44] the
[1:37:45] man and in verse
[1:37:50] 16
[1:37:51] If any man have ears to hear Let Him
[1:37:59] hear so Jesus is saying that nothing can
[1:38:01] really contaminate a man that's from the
[1:38:04] outside but what comes out of the
[1:38:07] man that is what defiles the
[1:38:11] man and it shows what's within the
[1:38:15] man let's see what contaminates the
[1:38:18] man would you like to see that okay
[1:38:24] okay if you don't want to see it that's
[1:38:26] perfectly fine but if you do we're going
[1:38:28] to take a look at
[1:38:30] it we're going to go over to the book of
[1:38:32] Hebrews on chapter 12 verse
[1:38:37] 15 uh Hebrews chap 12 verse
[1:38:47] 14 I hope none of you left the beans uh
[1:38:50] turned on because this is the last
[1:38:52] service of the
[1:38:53] year and it reads like
[1:38:58] this follow peace with all men
[1:39:01] comma what does it
[1:39:03] say do you have enmity with every
[1:39:06] man are you an enemy with
[1:39:10] everybody no it says to have peace with
[1:39:12] all men peace with
[1:39:16] everybody not a group here over here
[1:39:20] with everybody
[1:39:24] we're going to read it together in
[1:39:25] Spanish
[1:39:30] okay in English follow peace
[1:39:35] follow peace peace with all with all men
[1:39:40] with all
[1:39:43] men and
[1:39:48] Holiness without which no man shall see
[1:39:50] the
[1:39:53] Lord then it says that no man shall see
[1:39:55] the Lord without
[1:39:56] H but the Bible tells
[1:40:00] us says to have peace with all
[1:40:04] men and
[1:40:06] Holiness without Holiness
[1:40:08] no without those two
[1:40:11] things nobody will see the
[1:40:14] Lord so then
[1:40:16] ourselves we need two
[1:40:18] things to have peace with all men
[1:40:21] and to have
[1:40:23] Holiness to be able to see the
[1:40:25] Lord if we don't have peace with all
[1:40:28] men we cannot see the
[1:40:31] Lord amen unto his
[1:40:34] word amen and then verse 15 says like
[1:40:38] this look
[1:40:42] diligently lest any man fail of the
[1:40:45] grace of
[1:40:48] God then listen really close to this
[1:40:54] lest any root of bitterness springing
[1:40:57] up trouble
[1:41:01] you and thereby many be
[1:41:05] defiled and then the scripture says in
[1:41:07] the Book of
[1:41:08] Mark says that whatever is outside of
[1:41:10] man doesn't contaminate the
[1:41:13] man but what comes out of the man that
[1:41:17] is what defiles the
[1:41:19] man what is a seed
[1:41:21] it goes into the
[1:41:23] heart the word of
[1:41:25] God Is Not the
[1:41:27] Only there's many
[1:41:29] seed there's seeds
[1:41:32] ofit seeds
[1:41:35] of pridefulness
[1:41:39] selfishness there's many
[1:41:43] seeds the serpent seed there's many
[1:41:48] of and how do those seeds come by
[1:41:52] hearing what are you
[1:41:55] hearing did you hear what the associate
[1:41:57] pastor did he he really ruined over here
[1:42:01] and over
[1:42:02] there but what are you listening to and
[1:42:05] then your
[1:42:06] mind it goes straight into your mind and
[1:42:08] then into your heart and then it brings
[1:42:11] for a root of
[1:42:16] bitterness what's outside of
[1:42:18] man does not contaminate me
[1:42:21] but what's within me and comes out of my
[1:42:24] mouth that is what contaminates the
[1:42:29] man do you love God do you love his word
[1:42:33] that's why the scripture says in verse
[1:42:37] 14 follow peace with all
[1:42:40] men that is my
[1:42:42] brother did you hear what the brother
[1:42:45] did no be at peace with
[1:42:49] all he is the best best
[1:42:51] interpret the best technician we
[1:42:55] got I don't want to hear nothing evil of
[1:42:58] him follow peace with all
[1:43:03] men we have to take that root of
[1:43:05] bitterness and burn
[1:43:09] it because without
[1:43:11] that nobody shall see the
[1:43:14] Lord how does those seeds come by
[1:43:19] hearing did you hear what the pastor
[1:43:21] did look what the pastor's doing you're
[1:43:24] listening you're
[1:43:27] hearing
[1:43:29] something that you shouldn't
[1:43:32] be is that
[1:43:34] it where does it come out of the mouth
[1:43:38] right
[1:43:39] here and what's within the
[1:43:42] heart all of that is what contaminates
[1:43:46] us that is
[1:43:48] biblical that's message
[1:43:51] and what's mess what's biblical I'm just
[1:43:54] like
[1:43:58] Mary according to Thy
[1:44:05] word even though it might sound like
[1:44:07] something that I can never
[1:44:09] understand let's go into the Book of
[1:44:13] Matthew Matthew
[1:44:16] 15 Matthew
[1:44:19] 15:10
[1:44:25] it's the other version of uh The Book of
[1:44:32] Mark starting in verse 10 and he called
[1:44:35] the multitude and said unto them hear
[1:44:38] and
[1:44:45] understand not that which goeth into the
[1:44:47] mouth defileth a man but that which
[1:44:50] cometh out of the mouth this defileth a
[1:44:56] man so then the Bible is telling me here
[1:44:58] that the steak is not going to
[1:45:00] contaminate the
[1:45:02] shrimp the green
[1:45:05] chili is not going to contaminate it's
[1:45:08] not going to be as bad than what comes
[1:45:11] out of my
[1:45:13] mouth and then in verse
[1:45:17] 12 then came his disciples and said unto
[1:45:20] him
[1:45:27] knowest thou that the Pharisees were
[1:45:28] offended after they heard this
[1:45:31] saying so
[1:45:33] then took him to the side Jesus the
[1:45:37] Pharisees they were
[1:45:40] offended when you preached the
[1:45:45] word so then not everybody's going to
[1:45:48] Rejoice some are going to get offended
[1:45:52] and so the Pharisees were
[1:45:55] offended then let's go over to the book
[1:45:58] of
[1:46:00] Acts let's learn how to use our
[1:46:05] sword in Acts
[1:46:10] 7 to verse
[1:46:19] 51 Steven is a deacon and he's going out
[1:46:22] to the multitude that wants to kill
[1:46:25] him and bringing forth a a tremendous
[1:46:29] message and speaking about
[1:46:32] Abraham talking about
[1:46:34] Moses how they came out forth from the
[1:46:37] red and bringing forth a message to
[1:46:45] preach that the Lord does not only abide
[1:46:47] in uh temples built by men
[1:46:51] but also in in human
[1:46:53] flesh so then
[1:46:56] Steven so then he hits the nail on the
[1:46:59] head look he's
[1:47:02] preaching and then he says here in verse
[1:47:09] 51 ye stiff necked and uncircumcised in
[1:47:12] heart and
[1:47:18] ears ye do also resist the Holy Ghost as
[1:47:21] your fathers did so do
[1:47:34] ye which of the prophets have not of
[1:47:37] your fathers persecuted and they have
[1:47:39] slain them which showed before the
[1:47:41] coming of the just
[1:47:47] one of whom ye have been now betrayers
[1:47:49] and murderers
[1:47:51] uh who have received the law by the
[1:47:53] disposition of
[1:48:01] angels so then Stephen is saying he
[1:48:03] heard that you had received this message
[1:48:04] by a messenger an
[1:48:06] angel and you did not keep
[1:48:12] it he said that you had received it from
[1:48:14] Messengers and Angels but you did not
[1:48:16] keep
[1:48:17] it and then in verse 54 he says so he's
[1:48:21] preaching and they're
[1:48:24] they're to the mind and then it goes
[1:48:26] into the
[1:48:28] mind and then it says that when they
[1:48:30] heard these
[1:48:32] things they were cut to the
[1:48:36] heart and they nashed on
[1:48:40] him so then they're listening to the
[1:48:43] word and they're listening to Steven
[1:48:48] preach and so then when they were
[1:48:49] hearing the the message being preached
[1:48:50] by
[1:48:53] him in their own Hearts they were very
[1:48:56] Furious and then that which was in
[1:49:00] them which showed
[1:49:03] physically and they were nashing their
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:07] teeth imagine somebody preaching the
[1:49:10] word and somebody else I don't want to
[1:49:13] hear that it's sitting
[1:49:17] down that's what they were doing here in
[1:49:19] the Bible
[1:49:21] they were nashing their
[1:49:22] teeth by the hearing of the
[1:49:26] word and they were offended by hearing
[1:49:28] the
[1:49:30] word and then we're going to go on to
[1:49:32] the acts uh chapter
[1:49:34] 5
[1:49:36] 5
[1:49:41] 533 here uh Peter's talking to the
[1:49:48] council because now now we come to the
[1:49:50] point that it was very something
[1:49:51] something very difficult to preach the
[1:49:53] gospel and then Peter said like
[1:49:59] this is it necessary to to obey man uh
[1:50:03] before
[1:50:06] God in verse
[1:50:10] 33 and when they heard
[1:50:14] that they were cut to the heart and took
[1:50:17] counsel to slay
[1:50:18] them when they heard
[1:50:22] this not only did they get
[1:50:26] mad but they wanted to kill Peter and
[1:50:28] all the
[1:50:30] apostles because they had heard the word
[1:50:32] of the
[1:50:34] Lord so then we're going to go back to
[1:50:36] the Book of
[1:50:37] Matthew are you following me
[1:50:42] brothers and then in verse
[1:50:49] 13
[1:50:51] but he answered every plant which my
[1:50:53] heavenly father hath not planted shall
[1:50:55] be rooted
[1:50:56] [Music]
[1:51:03] up let them alone they be blind leaders
[1:51:06] of the Blind and if the blind leadth the
[1:51:14] Blind and then uh answered Peter and
[1:51:16] said unto him declare unto us this
[1:51:23] Parable and Jesus said are ye also yet
[1:51:26] without
[1:51:31] understanding do not ye yet understand
[1:51:33] that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth
[1:51:36] goeth into the
[1:51:43] belly and is cast out into the drought
[1:51:46] but those things which proceed out of
[1:51:48] the mouth come for forth from the heart
[1:51:51] and defile the man
[1:51:55] okay uh before it says what comes out of
[1:51:58] the
[1:51:59] mouth but then Jesus here explaining the
[1:52:04] parable in reality it doesn't come out
[1:52:06] of the
[1:52:07] mouth it comes out of the
[1:52:11] heart and then in verse 19 it
[1:52:15] says for out of the heart proceed evil
[1:52:18] thoughts so then the
[1:52:21] heart has
[1:52:25] thoughts that's where the mind
[1:52:31] is we have
[1:52:33] a we have an
[1:52:37] ear and the word has to come down to our
[1:52:40] hearts and the prophet says that the
[1:52:42] only
[1:52:44] way the only way that we can be born
[1:52:48] again is by by receiving the word of the
[1:52:51] Lord in the womb of the
[1:52:54] mind that's what the prophet
[1:52:57] says the spoken word is the
[1:52:59] original the only
[1:53:01] way to be born again first of
[1:53:05] all is to hear the
[1:53:07] word in the
[1:53:10] mind right here the
[1:53:12] mind and then you either accept it or
[1:53:14] reject
[1:53:16] it and then the spirit comes upon it
[1:53:21] and then brings forth the
[1:53:23] life and we're going to explain that in
[1:53:25] just a
[1:53:27] bit so then when the serpent came unto
[1:53:31] Eve he came and preached the word he
[1:53:35] came to
[1:53:36] her and preached the
[1:53:38] word to be able to conquer her
[1:53:42] spirit to then there take control of her
[1:53:48] body and right here here uh in closing
[1:53:53] now I don't know if the brothers have it
[1:53:55] over here in the
[1:53:57] slides the mark of the
[1:54:01] beast your heart is a
[1:54:05] womb you know what I'm speaking of women
[1:54:07] and
[1:54:08] men your heart is of the
[1:54:12] womb and the womb holds the
[1:54:14] seed and the seed is the
[1:54:18] gospel
[1:54:20] now the seat
[1:54:21] alone in its
[1:54:25] heart like the prophet wants to kind of
[1:54:27] say something here but he doesn't do
[1:54:34] it no matter how many Galos you sit
[1:54:41] under and it doesn't matter because you
[1:54:42] might say well I had this teacher that
[1:54:45] doesn't
[1:54:47] matter no matter how great your pastor
[1:54:52] is and how much you've read the Bible
[1:54:55] ouch okay
[1:54:59] okay okay the next
[1:55:05] one okay
[1:55:08] okay so then you're hearing the word
[1:55:10] amen and it comes into the
[1:55:13] heart but in there it still has no life
[1:55:17] because it's
[1:55:18] just just how you plant a seed on the
[1:55:21] ground it's just they're
[1:55:23] dormant it requires water okay okay okay
[1:55:26] just follow
[1:55:30] me says No matter how much you read your
[1:55:34] Bible it'll never take
[1:55:38] life until the germ of life has come to
[1:55:42] it and we're going to find out what that
[1:55:44] germ of life
[1:55:47] is the woman's seed is a wonderful
[1:55:51] thing it's the building of the
[1:55:53] body but it has no life okay I'm just
[1:55:57] going to read it
[1:56:08] firste a woman seed is a wonderful thing
[1:56:11] it's building the body but it has no
[1:56:12] life it can it's impossible it has no
[1:56:15] life to begin with so no matter how much
[1:56:17] you know the
[1:56:18] Bible
[1:56:22] and how well it is in your
[1:56:24] heart
[1:56:26] you're still a
[1:56:28] sinner Wow Let's go to the next one
[1:56:37] brother okay right
[1:56:40] there now what
[1:56:43] happen the heart is the
[1:56:47] womb and Faith cometh by open
[1:56:50] ear that's not been sealed up by
[1:56:54] theology how much you
[1:56:58] know he brings it down to the me the the
[1:57:01] Simplicity of the
[1:57:02] message the
[1:57:07] Simplicity because God hides and reveals
[1:57:10] himself in
[1:57:12] Simplicity and there's so many that are
[1:57:14] grabbed by
[1:57:18] theology that can't that they can't
[1:57:20] accept the very small simple
[1:57:23] things faith comes by
[1:57:28] hearing you take you make up your mind
[1:57:30] about
[1:57:32] it is that right could that be right and
[1:57:36] the prophet
[1:57:37] says well the Bible said so I believe
[1:57:41] it wow in proph say
[1:57:46] w there is the heart of gold
[1:57:51] so then it's a
[1:57:52] womb and then the male sex
[1:57:55] comes we are the bride the
[1:57:58] woman the seed comes into the
[1:58:02] church the
[1:58:04] preaching and then the male sex
[1:58:09] comes which is the blood of Christ which
[1:58:12] is then
[1:58:14] applied and the blood comes in The Germ
[1:58:16] of
[1:58:18] life
[1:58:19] that goes into the seed and brings forth
[1:58:21] a newborn
[1:58:22] baby what is the prophet saying
[1:58:26] here you're the the prophet saying that
[1:58:28] you got a wom here in your heart you're
[1:58:30] hearing the
[1:58:31] word you decide here on your
[1:58:34] mind whether you accept it or reject if
[1:58:37] you accept it it's going to be in
[1:58:39] here you're bringing it down in
[1:58:43] here it's just like a woman when she is
[1:58:46] pregnant the baby begins to form
[1:58:50] but the prophet tells us that it has no
[1:58:53] life by its own amen
[1:59:01] amen that's why the prophet say it
[1:59:02] doesn't matter how much you read your
[1:59:04] Bible there is no
[1:59:07] life you may have it here down in your
[1:59:10] heart you may know the
[1:59:13] message and you know what you're
[1:59:15] supposed to do not supposed to do and
[1:59:17] you know the
[1:59:18] Bible there will be no
[1:59:21] life until the Holy Ghost
[1:59:26] comes and gives you that revelation of
[1:59:28] this
[1:59:29] word because when the woman is
[1:59:32] pregnant she begins to form
[1:59:38] a the arms begin to develop themselves
[1:59:40] within the womb there's the word it's
[1:59:43] being develop it's developing the
[1:59:47] body and then the prophet says that
[1:59:49] there's a spirit just going around the
[1:59:52] woman so that when the baby comes
[1:59:55] out then the life comes into the
[1:59:58] baby that's why when the baby comes
[2:00:01] out it begins to cry and
[2:00:05] cry because life came into it that's why
[2:00:09] there are some babies that are
[2:00:11] born and they do
[2:00:13] nothing and it's something very
[2:00:16] sad when he sees a stillborn Bab
[2:00:21] takes the
[2:00:23] baby and gives her his
[2:00:26] spanking and then the baby begins to
[2:00:28] react and life comes into
[2:00:31] it because the body is already
[2:00:34] formed but the spirit has not yet
[2:00:37] entered it's the same thing with
[2:00:40] us we have the word we know the
[2:00:45] message but until the Holy Ghost
[2:00:48] comes now we have
[2:00:52] life that's why the prophet
[2:00:57] says my God my
[2:00:59] God then someone then you begin to
[2:01:02] react and realize why did I do these
[2:01:05] things why did I do these
[2:01:10] things because now The Germ has taken a
[2:01:13] hold of the scene and has brought forth
[2:01:16] life
[2:01:18] amen
[2:01:23] amen I'm closing
[2:01:28] now when Mary was
[2:01:31] there and the angel
[2:01:33] came that angel had a name what was the
[2:01:37] name of that angel Miguel Gabriel
[2:01:39] Michael or
[2:01:40] Gabriel Gabriel
[2:01:44] Gabriel his name was Gabriel what is an
[2:01:48] angel
[2:01:50] a
[2:01:51] messenger and when that messenger came
[2:01:54] you're going to conceive a
[2:01:57] child how is that going to be
[2:02:02] possible so then she accepted the word
[2:02:05] she heard the
[2:02:06] word accepted the
[2:02:08] word and she said like
[2:02:12] this hearen unto me the the hands hands
[2:02:15] made of the
[2:02:16] Lord be done to me
[2:02:20] according to Thy
[2:02:21] word she didn't
[2:02:26] say you know that message is a bit harsh
[2:02:28] for
[2:02:30] me no she said I accept
[2:02:34] this even though that word may sound a
[2:02:36] little
[2:02:38] strange how is it possible that a virgin
[2:02:42] shall how is it possible that my child
[2:02:44] is going to return return to
[2:02:46] church how is it possible that I'm going
[2:02:48] to give
[2:02:50] because the promises of
[2:02:52] God are are Supernatural
[2:02:55] things it's not for the
[2:02:58] natural it's for the
[2:03:02] Supernatural and she accepted that
[2:03:03] message of that
[2:03:06] angel and she surrendered her body to
[2:03:08] the
[2:03:10] word and she said be un to me according
[2:03:13] to Thy word and in this day there is a
[2:03:17] virgin and it's the Bride of Jesus
[2:03:21] Christ she is a
[2:03:23] virgin that she has not been touched and
[2:03:26] an angel came what's the name of that
[2:03:28] angel William maram Bram William maram
[2:03:33] Bram God never came to
[2:03:36] Mary he sent Gabriel and in this
[2:03:40] day God has an angel William by the name
[2:03:46] of williiam maram
[2:03:47] Bram
[2:03:49] he came to the uh
[2:03:52] virgin and preached the
[2:03:55] message brought forth the message and
[2:03:59] the of this day has
[2:04:04] said be it unto me according to Thy
[2:04:07] word even though this word I don't not
[2:04:11] understand it might be a
[2:04:13] bit but I accept
[2:04:17] it when
[2:04:20] I know I'm going a bit over time when
[2:04:23] Mary uh the angel came she heard she
[2:04:28] accepted and began to
[2:04:32] conceive and the prophet tells us that
[2:04:35] the Lord Jesus
[2:04:37] Christ is the Original Seed amen
[2:04:41] amen and she received
[2:04:45] it without a
[2:04:47] sensation
[2:04:51] when a when a man and a woman get
[2:04:53] together there is a sensation
[2:04:56] flesh she never had a
[2:05:02] sensation she had received the Holy
[2:05:05] G blessed be the name of Lord that's why
[2:05:09] many people they get so
[2:05:11] confused that they believe that they
[2:05:13] have to shout that they have to
[2:05:15] dance and the Holy Ghost is without
[2:05:21] sensation she
[2:05:23] Reed The Original Seed without a single
[2:05:29] sensation and she
[2:05:31] herself by her own will to show that she
[2:05:36] had the Lord Jesus Christ in
[2:05:38] her and the prophet says that there is a
[2:05:41] true genuine
[2:05:43] evidence that you have the Holy
[2:05:47] Ghost the Pentecost say that you have to
[2:05:49] speak in
[2:05:50] tongues and other say that you have to
[2:05:52] come to church but the prophet
[2:05:56] says this has never failed what I have
[2:05:59] said and he said this
[2:06:03] way it's he that
[2:06:06] believes every
[2:06:09] word every
[2:06:13] word it's not that he's picky that he
[2:06:15] picks this word yes and this word
[2:06:17] no but it's he that believes every
[2:06:20] single word that is the
[2:06:22] evidence that you have the Holy Ghost
[2:06:25] and in the in this day we have received
[2:06:29] the
[2:06:29] messenger with without
[2:06:33] sensation please
[2:06:37] stand and the prophet says this
[2:06:39] way that the musicians can come up
[2:06:42] now and the song
[2:06:45] leader one of the last quotes that I got
[2:06:52] uh if sometime the the the ways of the
[2:06:54] Lord are so
[2:06:57] hard to comprehend for the human
[2:07:01] mind some might think that they're just
[2:07:03] really
[2:07:05] ridiculous and the faith is ridiculous
[2:07:08] for the human
[2:07:11] mind it's craziness to
[2:07:15] many but it's not for God and for those
[2:07:18] have
[2:07:19] faith by faith we
[2:07:23] believe things that our eyes cannot
[2:07:27] see and our minds cannot declare
[2:07:30] it only because we believe
[2:07:33] it the prophet says that
[2:07:36] reasonings will never be
[2:07:40] correct so then we cannot reason it or
[2:07:43] study
[2:07:45] it this will only confuse our minds
[2:07:49] there is only one way of doing
[2:07:54] it and believing that God will be more
[2:07:57] than able to fulfill that which he has
[2:07:59] promised and that settles
[2:08:01] it don't
[2:08:04] try and then they might say well how is
[2:08:06] it going to
[2:08:08] happen we're living in a modern
[2:08:12] time and take away that from your
[2:08:15] mind don't even double think it
[2:08:20] only take
[2:08:22] him by his
[2:08:25] word take the decision this
[2:08:29] moment of what God has
[2:08:32] said that God can
[2:08:35] fulfill and it's not my business to know
[2:08:37] it or understand because if I try to do
[2:08:40] that I am
[2:08:44] trying to do it by intellectual
[2:08:47] planning
[2:08:50] God does not move by the
[2:08:52] brains he moves within the heart this
[2:08:57] and then this the last quote that he
[2:09:00] says if you're a young
[2:09:03] woman dedicate your
[2:09:05] morals I don't know where the young
[2:09:07] people are the young
[2:09:09] ladies if you're a young
[2:09:12] lady dedicate your
[2:09:14] morals if you're a young
[2:09:16] man dedicate your moral
