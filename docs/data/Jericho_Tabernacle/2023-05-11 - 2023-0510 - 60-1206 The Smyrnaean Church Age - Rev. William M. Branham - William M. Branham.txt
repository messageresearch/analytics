TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] my brother William Marion Branham was delivered Tuesday evening December 6 1960 at the Branham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville Indiana USA Elementary in English Jeffersonville Indiana now the second Church age was called The Church age of somernia and it taken place the samuria age was issued in at the same time the Ephesian age went out this Ephesian age was from 80 55 to 8170. the Smyrna Age come in at 170 and goes to 312. is this church is the persecuted Church the one that wears the martyr's crown is a church of tribulation and God's promise to to the elected Church in it was to give it a Crown of Life is hidden Asia foreign God's hand which represent the messenger to that church age the best that I could think was the messenger at the Ephesian Church age because the Bible does not say who they are was Paul travisia connection because he established the Ephesian Church and was the minister of that church age that brought the light to the church with Saint John picked it up from there and then pull a carton on down Apollo cart rather on down [Music] age I believe with all the and I have been able to find was ireneous and now I want to give you the reason why that I chose arenas instead of polar cards now most all clergyman wants to think and Bible teaches that that angel was palakar a pop cart was a disciple of Saint John that is true and apologize sealed he was a martyr they stabbed him out of the heart and killed him is now but he was a great man and no affordable man a Godly Man sweet no doubt one of the great best Christians we've ever had and there was nothing you could say against his life the reason that I chose Arrhenius because I believe at Arenas was more closer to the scripture than public art was because Apollo Court leaned kindly towards the Roman idea of setting up an organization and and Aurelius was firmly against it he absolutely denounced it now carpo lescent organizations and then as we all know the great issue was coming at the niacin Council one of the great issues was whether God was three Our God was one and Arrhenius took the side that God was God now in just one is I might read from the ananiasing fathers volume 1 page 412 just a little quotation if you want to put that down volume one of the ice Nicene fathers and on page 12. and it's uh if you want the volume it's the last part of volume three you might read the whole thing is several uh chapters of it or several um sentences now begin to read write the last brought the last 20 30 verses of it I won't read it all but just part of it is all the other Expressions likewise being bring out the title of one and the same being see he's trying to say what they call him father son Holy Ghost they said that's titles not names titles of the one being that's exactly what we teach here today results as for the example and then inferences in English the Lord of power the Lord father of Almighty most high Creator the maker and such like these are not the names and titles of succession of different beings but of one and the same amen foreign the example and then in for instance in English the Lord of power the Lord father of all God Almighty most high Creator the maker and such like these are not the names and titles of succession of different beings but of one and the same amen El mismo amen by the name of which the one God father is he He Who all these things Grant to all it of its existence the boom of all existence foreign that all these titles are summed up into one name under one God and they are only titles of what he was he was The Rose of Sharon that's what he was that's the title he was the Morning Star he was Alpha he was Omega that's titles of what he was he was father he was son he was Holy Ghost it is but there's one God one God in his name is one and that's one reason I thought Arenas was correct in his in his diagnosis your interpretation of the scripture yes another thing that I'd like to read you it's found in the book how did it happen and this is by the historians and um how did it happen by R.C Hazelton the history of the early churches and here on page 180 the spiritual in Irene is this time A.D 177-202 a reason I'm quoting this is going on tape you see and and it'll be taken off on books that the most of the Apostolic Church it was not uncommon to see someone dead brought back to life healing was healing wise and every day occurrence and all the Evangelist Evangelical churches everywhere as parties Miracles were frequent in fact those churches were never without a miraculous manifestation of God's presence either by Vision Superstition are the elements of nature in a miracle to remind the Evangelical Christians of that day there was his beloved disciples is but from the histories of the past we cannot glean a single instance of raising the dead in the first Roman Church that's people that don't not interested in either side they're just telling the truth it's historians Romana Jesus that's why I think Arenas because you see he had faith that Paul and the disciples had handed down that's why I have believed that he was the angel of the Church of someranian because he was he had the same scriptural teachings and the same scriptural teachings upon the basis of God's word will produce the same thing every time transmitido Foreigner and carried out to the letter no matter what the church is say just follow it just the way it says it'll produce the same thing and that's what arenius did so you stay this is now I think that Paula carte was a fine man understand but I say that he leaned too much to organize the church and like the Nickelodeon's was doing they were organized in the church and and bringing a Brotherhood together which seems all right intellectually but you see the spirit is so far ahead of the intellectual so that you can't even think right to the spirit this is my hot thoughts are higher than your thoughts saith God my ways are higher than your ways so there's only one way to do that just follow him by the blueprint that's right she is now we might think if you was going from Europe I was going uh to Chicago tonight oh I might be out here get me a compass and say now let's see Chicago right this way all right I'll take right off I wouldn't get out of Jeffersonville the Jeffersonville Ben I got to get me a road man and it's a way lined out and I can go to Chicago to seven hours of travel by automobile but I can't just cut anyway the airplane just can't cut anyway he's got a certain height a certain degrees that he has to stay in there's a way made and God has a way foreign God has a way for his church for his people and he never did intended to be controlled by popes Cardinals Archbishop or general overseers the holy spirit is the tutor of the Church of the Living God the reasons and all the Holiness don't go to a car signal or a priest to make him a holy manner in the church anything the laity is Justice right much right to the Holy Spirit as any preacher pastor Deacon trustee whatever more laity today Direction they call it nickel Ladies as we had last night Nickel in we broke the word down took it from the Greek and in i c k o which means to conquer or to overthrows what nickel lady laity to conquer the laity and overthrow it by giving them a order of man clergyman that would teach them and would uh they would get their own conclusions together okay that's how the United Council was held they caused many other and fixed up uh an order in the Nicene Council we ain't going to talk too much on it because that's Thursday nights in the Nicene council is where the Roman Catholic Church was formed out of a group of people that were converts of Saint Paul and Arenas and Saint Martin and on down foreign they were converted Christians to the from paganism over to Christianity but wanted to pull the church back into an Old Testament form of ministry like having high priests and and Apostolic successions like one Pope John christianismo if we could go on down to this Bible you'd find out that that's just exactly the truth and how God condemned the thing from the very beginning in last night's Church they said I hated him so did the churches God never intended the church to be run by man amen God runs his church and he runs it through gifts of the spirit the gifts of the Spirit is in the church to correct the spiritombre minister of officers in his church first of them is Apostles or missionaries missionary is the highest calling there is Apostle a word missionary means one cent Apostle means one sin while they ever chose to be called a missionary I don't know but they are Apostles a Apostles all right Apostles prophets teachers evangelists pastors now that's the elected offices of God to his church evangelistas pastores then in each local church there's nine spiritual gifts that come among the people that is knowledge wisdom Gifts of healing working of Miracles speaking with tongues interpretation of tongues and all these things go in each and every person in the church has an individual Ministry and that individual Ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Jesus Christo and never I remember this I'll draw these times tonight the first church Ephesus somernia pergos Philadelphia Philadelphia pergamo the atira Sardis Philadelphia now remember as this goes on this church has the fullness of the spirit but at the end of the church age we find that it was being pressed out is a little more so this one they were just a little teeny Speck you have a few things he said oh when we get to that tatara church age God raised up a German by the name of Martin Luther that swung the church back again it started out a little more he preached justification a long-com Martin Luther reached justification foreign sanctification then in this church age here they come right straight back again to the baptism of the Holy Ghost again with the same signs and wonders coming right down Juan Wesley predication is here's where it went out to 1500 years of Dark Ages and there's where the darkest and the longest church period we had in the church then here's where it starts coming out justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and the Bible says that in the end of this age that this little minority here will be squeezed down because the same church of Pentecost will start doing the same thing they started back there Nickelodeon Greg wacky isanto is [Music] you that the messenger to this church Angel hate denominations amen amen appear to raise up in the children there's always been boom um we gotta now if you notice this how it was greater when I finally smothered it all the way out then it starts back Luther pulled it back justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and right at the end time he Smothers it right down until this is almost completely gone out yeah [Music] didn't say there will be no flesh saved see there you are right at the end time now bear that in mind yes now we're going to start on this uh samarnia Church age first I want to break it down here on some paper that I that I have now the second Church age being simonia and I believe you'll all agree with me or hope you do or halfway anyhow that iridius was the star to that church age he was God's messenger because he swept the country in the France Gall down in there and he established has shown the baptism of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues raising the dead Healing The Sick stopping the rains and Performing Miracles daily they know that the Living God lived among the people is that was a man of God Amen Lord Jesus said no man can do the the people said no man can do these works except God be with him it was Nicodemus that told Jesus that is now a city of Commerce a Trading Outlet to Lydia and to the West the third largest city in Asia a great Harbor City in ordered for wealth temples buildings schools medicine and science edificios escuelas medicine Jews leave that at Samira they evangelize the Samaritan people power card was the first Bishop of Samaria power card and other Faithful Servants establish the Deep faith of God in the believing Samaritans early church fathers give exhortation of the truth to Samaria is the church age of Samaritan the name of the church was Samira Samaria rather that means uh bitterness mura It's associated with dead because they were dying significa Mira [Music] A persecuted church God called him persecuted God looked upon their persecutions and gave Grace to bear he looked upon his tribulations and gave them victory over death looked upon their poverty and give them riches in him is the Church of someria passed through the fiery furnace of tribulations but was a sweet smelling savior unto him that's that Remnant now not the old simonian church just a Remnant I'm speaking of the great 10 days of tribulation means 10 years of the bloodiest persecution is pronounce or not this was the emperor at that time I believe was the bloodiest one of all of them since Nero in 67. d-i-o-c-l-e-t-i-n during the year of 303 to 312 A.D no says oh is God exhorts to be faithful unto them as he was and I will give you a Crown of Life as the father has given me God promised the overcomer in tribulations the victory over the second death fear not them which can kill the body but he that can destroy the silver kill the soul is fear not man and a crown of life will be given you the persecution of Christianity in the ages are typed in the church ages of Samira are very important we want to get to it just a little bit Lord willing Jesus is now if some of you missed some of these if I write them a little too fast for the rest of the class then we um we are you can certainly get them from us anytime you want to we'd be glad to to give them to you excuse me is is now on the second chapter and the eighth verse We Begin tonight now what did we leave him on last night he was certainly hated that Nickelodeon is that rhyme Ocho monsters now what does God do what we have to found out first the revelation of Jesus Christ who he is and what he is now the next great thing we find out that he hates anything that'll put anything to rule over his church besides himself he is a jealous God hold on importante is how I like this stuff because we just got four verses here just a quote a little something how many can remember when the good prophet Samuel when all of Israel wanted to act like the rest of the world you remember that foreign the prophet told them said you're wrong but they wanted to act like the Philistines and like the the rest of them well that's exactly what happened in this very first church age it's strange that people don't want God to lead them they want to fight they want some man Israel made the greatest mistake it ever made when Grace had already provided them a prophet a leader provide them a lamb as an atonement and provided them food from the heavens and all the good things that Grace had provided them is and still in Exodus 19 they wanted a law they want to make doctors of divinity and as men they won't have something to do into it too yeah hombres man's always trying to outsmart the very creative as a few Sundays ago I preached on the um the hybrid religion that's exactly when you hybrid anything it can never it's done it's finished you can't come back no more hello universe a mule can never breathe back and have another Mew because he is a Mew he's a hybrid find corn you can't raise fine corn off a fine hybrid corn it won't even it might come up as well it's no good at all you can't do it anything is hybrid's no good reproduces in a hybrid religion is no good as long as you're trying to add something to what God Said or do something that God don't want you to do it's a hybrid religion is it might look pretty or hybrid corn will outshine the natural corn an old mule outworked two horses well that's it ain't working brother it's Grace that we're thinking about not by works are we say it but by Grace natural s is so that might I hope you don't think these remarks you're you're sitting under strain and I feel it up here see because there's Presbyterian methodists in all kinds and here we know that and uh so I feel it you have to relax yourself a little once in a while get that shake-off point era is observations now listen and he thinks hybrid is no good you've got to take the original way God made it then you've got something as real amen foreign that this Church of Israel as they passed on God had fed them and taken care of them and done everything for them and finally they looked over to the Philistines and the amorites and the in different ones and said we want a king they got something we ain't got Israel mientes that's the same thing the people does today uh one of these our sisters well look over at the television and see Glory Swanson or whoever some of them women with a certain kind of address on and they just can't stand it till they get one see this is some woman down there oh isn't that darling what you wear I said it's a day of of uh impersonation somebody wants to impersonate the other Centro honest personification you take the there's so many Elvis Presleys now I'll tell you couldn't sack them up in boxcars because he become popular carnal comp uh impersonations we have the same thing in religion is that I've read the history of Martin Luther and any historians though they said it wasn't a mysterious thing that Luther could protest the Catholic church and get by with it but the greatest mystery to get to hold his head above all the fanaticism that followed his Revival and still stay with the word that's the miracle how God kept him clear and straight is so they come to this Samuel they said make us a problem make us a a king and the Lord told him that he rejected that idea just exactly what he rejected here with organization is just like he rejected that he rejects organizations he don't reject organism but organization organism we have to have that but organization we don't have to have because it draws lines we are so and so are you a Christian I'm Methodist are you Christian I'm Baptist that don't mean no more than a pig in a pen it has nothing to do with it not at all a Christian o list that's the girl one night on the platform are you a Christian she said I'll give you to understand our burner candle every night like that had anything to do with Christianity foreign [Music] not a thing you're a Christian because you belong to another kingdom that's right and you're you're in another kingdom above poses now what did Samuel do just the same thing Samuel cough he said now listen to me I want to ask you something has there ever been one time that I ever told you anything that wasn't true is God's Prophet among you tell me one time I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord that didn't come to pass that's what Samuel said to me because he said and hasn't got virgin taking care of you and all these things say oh element is something else have I ever took any money away from you have I ever begged you for an offering or have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord it didn't come to pass they said no you never took our money that's true and you've never told us anything in the name of the Lord that didn't come to pass he said then hear me you're sitting but trying to act like the rest of them but they want the king anyhow regardless what is right or wrong they want to carry out their idea says that's the same thing the church did right here at Ephesus they've taken the Nickelodeon Doctrine and when they did it convert paganism and Christianity together and it's caused a 1500 years of Dark Ages and when Luther pulled them out if the second round the lutherans didn't do the same thing they did back in Ephesus anyway exactly it's amazing this is now if you notice the candlesticks didn't sit quite like that they started down in this way come on well the highest one away from where he was standing was this one up here is and Christianity gradually smothered out as it went from where he was standing across we would see him in the fourth chapter and the shape of the Cross like this and this is his right hand that was his left hand Christian is now right here he had his hand on this church and on that church he was both Alpha and Omega of course all was in between the two all the other letters but he specifically said Alpha and Omega he had a rainbow over his head which was his Covenant is now if you notice the light of Pentecost where it started gradually smothered out these men Arenas polycar all the rest of them seal their testimony with their blood until it finally squeezed Christianity into the dark as it is the first age the other side of that great Hub coming over was a little bit alike more light and more light you see how it begins to shine again coming unto that day and now at the end of this age it's predicted here that it comes to a lady oh seeing a lukewarm now what I'm eating must lose a foreign [Music] yeah and you know the Bible said there'd be a beast and we know that's a Roman papacy that's exactly right then they would origin of churches cost us in it it'll come a time where you'll either belong to an organization you can't keep your door open right organizations verdad it's the reason we pound it to death yeah yes sir you and evil well other than that they'll try to seek you so badly to try to won't let you bite or sell this you've got that organization it brings it right questions foreign [Music] the Bible thank you a little more across between every one of you right we want to welcome you to Jericho tabernac stop in San Diego dress I was thinking in the back of how little of us are here [Music] not reflection but then I begin to reflect a bit OS that were not so little yes because each and every one of us is worth more than ten thousand worlds so then if we multiply it is the church is pretty full so I don't think we should be disappointed by that that was preached by a Galleria to
