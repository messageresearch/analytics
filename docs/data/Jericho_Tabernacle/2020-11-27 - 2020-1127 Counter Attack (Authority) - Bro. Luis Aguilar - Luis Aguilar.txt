thankful lord to to have this message to have this word now lord may you accept our thanksgiving acceptance gracious may lord may you accept us tonight lord may you help the young people and lord those young people in in the spiritual itamina spirit lord we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen let us open up our bibles into first samuel primera the 15th chapter el capital verse 22. it's nice to be here in the house of the lord is nice to see all of you here today yes i'd like to thank the lord as always for the life also our pastor brother johnny for the trust he owes he's always has towards us and samuel said hath the lord as great delight and birth offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fed of rams says when the righteous are in authority the people rejoice but when the wicked beareth rule may the lord bless the reading of his word i pray that you pray pray for me in your mind in your heart [Music] so we can bring something for the young people and um i in this evening i have a title and if the church can only understand it how much authority they have in the church in the the individual individual they have a revival when they hear that so i have authority i can do this and i can do that i can come here and i can speak the name of the lord and that's nothing but the truth yes but there is a process system process there is a way access to god has given us the message and we must listen to the messages there is a process existing processor uh on matthew 28 18 in mateo when when the lord resurrected he went through a lot of things el paso and he had and if the lord grants us the life and opportunity we will like to speak that on a little bit more as the days go i want you young people to really really focus on the word because this this really uh really struck me he had to be obedient he had to be subject and to be under authority wait a minute now the son of god jesus christ he had to be subject he had to be obedient he had to be under authority jesus had to be subject had to be obedient himself to joseph and mary jose maria now now you might say brother i don't i don't agree with that when joseph said jesus juan jose dijo jesus clean up after your room uh limpy put your shoes where they need to be at guard you can tell so you're going to tell me jesus said no i'm not going to put my shoes where they need to be at is go fetch me some firewood he had to do it because the enemy is really giving us a really good in obedience to the father in obedience i'm gonna repeat that one more time jesus had to get baptized he was baptized in obedience to the father walk back out to the banks and the heavens was opened so even christ had to be baptized now why did christ had to be baptized because the word says you must be baptized he had to fulfill the scriptures he had to go through a process brother branham says in the message the resurrection of jairus daughter restoration 1954. 18. moving from who who haven't been here honestly we've been speaking a little bit of demonology and you might think well brother are you still speaking about that we're still speaking about demonology he was always busy about the father's business he was very he was a very humble son i noticed every word that the prophet says he was a very elera it was a little bit it was very you know humble um don't answer me you you'd say that to the lord you talked that to yourself it was very a very humble son in and obedience even to death he was obedient even to death amen now brother brown i'm going to skip a little paragraph here and it says but he went over there at the cry of one person talking about he crossed the seas to go see that maniac now for the ones who weren't here last time [Music] he said he went over there of the cry of one person perhaps he was a good man one time wow perhaps a good man one time and just like abraham walked up right before the lord yes but but probably got in the wrong crowd you when i see a gray-headed that's a woman who's gone through a lot of stuff the scripture says somewhere in proverbs because these are you forgive me if i'm wrong but you're gonna miss him okay that's like a crown corona when i see an old great head mother i say that woman has been through a lot evi jesus crossed the sea jesus christ all the way over in the gadara hashtag 8 we see a couple verses before jesus runs into a roman soldier jesus and that's in matthew 8 5. and this roman soldiers need is that his servant was sick and and and brother branham says uh this is that he didn't do these things to show his authority which was spoken by isaiah as the prophet himself took our infirmities he's fulfilling the scripture he didn't do these things to display his authority but to fulfill the scriptures now this roman soldier appeared or came to jesus jesus and he said lord my servant lie at home sick grievously tormented jesus said i will come and heal him and verse 8 says the satarian answered i want to break it down for you real quick this soldier is the soldado at authority he says lord i'm not worthy for you to come because because i know authority you have do this i don't have to go and check if he does it nothing okay i don't have to go and check i have to tell him two or three times for him to do it for authorities because you have you don't have to go tell them one or two three times to leave nothing else under authority speak to her page last time we were here ultimately amen i remember i just just just going sidetrack a little bit back home in casa i have uncle who has down syndrome sometimes i'm they're another voice spoke to me he said well he's the only one who says amen so i said okay keep saying amen he's then verse nine excuse me verse 10. yes when jesus heard it jesus when he heard this man say i don't need you to come here jesus marveled jesus he that's why we're still speaking even though we have a different title anki us faith is faith to be under authority because brother branham says in the church authority to be under before you had it has to be under authority when i was a lot younger 1716 somewhere around there and i i began to preach and i helped the ministers and so forth oh i have authority i'm the man and uh so anyways that started getting into my head got the word i got the message i know the order you think i have authority and i go to my home and i start telling you you do this then you will be able to reign and the lord gives us life we want to speak about reigning and that really bursts my bubble yes it just deflated me medicine flow it just got me tumble i thought i had authority but i knew the message and i knew this you know more messages than my mom and my dad yesterday madrid was and and you can base this on any way you want yes in the business whatever you like imagine me telling my boss what to do you need to come this samuel the scripture that we read on the 15th chapter in the capital it says it says has the lord hath great delight in birth offerings and sacrifice and obeying the voice of the lord where does it delight anymore and offerings and sacrifices or obeying the voice of the lord behold you say oh notice behold he says like a great revelation revelations you know you don't say the word behold unless you're going to like show something to obey they say better than sacrifice sacrificing notice he's he's not he's not telling okay be obedient but do i have a mediocre job and just kind of do it like that fear and trembling if you're going to be a barber do it like you're going to do it for christ i'm going to do it for this guy don't do it with all your heart that's outside the church i'm going to i'm going to please the men please brother johnny we can put me to preach a little bit more i'm going to do it like this so they can see me but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart with god with good will excuse me with good will doing service to in order to have fulfillment of his authority first samuel 15 23. for those that don't think paraquas canopy and said obedience wow i'm gonna repeat that one more time i don't do witchcraft i don't i don't do those uh uh when it's shedding the blood and doing all those things uh this is something for rebellion instant is a sin as witchcraft your butt your butt that stubborn is going to be about to get out of here now to leave now i believe in the spiritual stubborn be stubborn to believe the word and i believe that there's a difference between sinners and and those who perform iniquity difference entrepreneur i'm good right where i'm at right here i'm good aqui is your being and you have to go through the process because thou has rejected the word of the lord you reject the word of the lord character oh lord oh i i i i really would like to break this down to pieces like brother johnny say one time comedy ah no no he wants the the hamburger right there that's how i feel like it i wish i could be like him like my interpreter period right ordinary notice you young people holiness we're counter-attacking spirits because spirits come in they're enticing attractiveness i don't care how much word you know no important i don't care how even if you speak in tongues in church no those demons know who you are he gave a good shaking to those disciples the disciples of christ those disciples yes they were disciples and yes they had power but they were never never obedient to the word they amen amen matthew 15 4. matteo quincey cuatro what does honor mean respect that respect oh my god don't don't don't just walk up there what's up mom what's up dan you know this is brother i had to have a quote here with brother graham says something like that he says mother mother father father don't call them by their first name mom mama dad papa let this message brother give me the new birth give me the baptism of the holy oh no no no wow oh my mom ain't good for nothing she doesn't know anything i should think she owns me she thinks the whole world curses my father and mother and that's the same scripture in exodus 21 17. he that curses his father or his mother also shall surely be put to death siblings well you can say well so-and-so is my mom and so-and-so is my dad i'm
