[29:21] said the world Sal mundo or whatever's
[29:24] before you whatever challenges you right
[29:26] now or look a second state Atlanta do
[29:28] still okay narrating there's a certain
[29:30] way to overcome that I see Ottoman era
[29:32] Devin series so any situation
[29:34] qualcare see Toshio let's start off with
[29:36] really first first John five five does
[29:39] come in simile and open middle they want
[29:41] Cinco Cinco who is he that overcometh
[29:44] the world but he that believeth that
[29:47] Jesus is the Son of God es el que viene
[29:50] el mundo sino LK Craig hey soos es el
[29:53] hijo de Dios the scripture is very soft
[29:55] explanatory Lazarus a split okay I
[29:59] screech oh yes sir either overcometh the
[30:01] world but he see Noel K Craig his priest
[30:08] oh okay hey soos is a little video so we
[30:10] believe a psychic Ramos that you believe
[30:13] by faith is the grape or faith God's
[30:16] world la palabra de Dios and that's how
[30:18] you overcome either smallest advancing
[30:21] by simply believing simply since he
[30:24] romantically and oh there's there's
[30:25] nothing that you can do in your own no
[30:27] another kiss the mismo puede I said
[30:29] there's no merit know anyone marital a
[30:32] free New Moon ofrenda where there's
[30:34] nothing good in us no another one so
[30:36] drops were all born in sin sickness even
[30:40] picado for medicine in Aquila
[30:41] but we believe the Bible the Word of God
[30:44] pero queremos la viva la la palabra
[30:46] Leo's innocent but he believeth that
[30:48] Jesus is the Son of God
[30:50] it's a scene Oh el que creo que es el
[30:53] hijo de Dios this is the one that
[30:54] overcomes I shall give it I'll give in
[30:57] theory it's that simple as he doesn't
[30:59] see you if you believe you stay cray

[31:14] primarily one Cinco cuatro for
[31:16] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[31:19] world por que todo lo que ha sido de
