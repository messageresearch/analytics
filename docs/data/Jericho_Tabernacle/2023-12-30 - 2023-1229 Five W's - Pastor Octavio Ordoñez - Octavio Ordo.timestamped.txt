[27:15] Lord the group of the Elders of this
[27:17] local
[27:21] assembly we've been
[27:25] asked with an urgent need
[27:32] young man
[27:34] Martinez in the city of
[27:38] Mexico he's in a very critical condition
[27:40] in his
[27:45] health and his brother Isaac Martinez is
[27:47] here representing him in his
[27:50] place he
[27:52] believes and I also

[28:08] infirmity it's been a year or two years
[28:10] [Music]

[28:30] chance to
[28:32] live but the almighty
[28:35] God who created the Heaven and the
[28:39] Earth can do
[28:41] [Music]
[28:45] anything and in a few days the Lord
[28:47] healed
[28:48] him and in that manner we
[28:51] believe that brother

[29:07] believe that he can do anything that you
[29:09] ask of

[42:34] why the five W's of
[42:40] christmasen let's look at Luke 1 verse
[42:47] 26 the birth of Jesus
[42:53] foretold Luke
[42:55] 1:26
[42:57] and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel
[42:59] was sent from God unto the city of
[43:02] Galilee named
[43:10] Nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man
[43:14] whose name was Joseph of the House of
[43:17] David and the virgin's name was
[43:25] Mary
[43:28] and the angel came unto her and said
[43:31] hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is
[43:36] with thee blessed are thou among
[43:49] women and when she saw him she was
[43:52] troubled at his
[43:54] saying and cast as in her mind what
[43:57] manner of salutation this should
[44:05] be and the angel said unto her fear not
[44:09] Mary for thou Hast found favor with
[44:17] God and behold th shalt conceive in thy
[44:22] womb and bring forth the son and shall
[44:25] call his name
[44:31] Jesus he shall be great and shall be
[44:35] called the son of the highest and the
[44:38] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[44:41] of his father
[44:49] David and he shall reign over the house
[44:53] of Jacob forever and his Kingdom and of
[44:57] his kingdom there shall be no
[45:04] end then said Mary unto the angel how
[45:07] shall this be seeing I know not
[45:15] amen and the angel answered and said
[45:17] unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon
[45:22] thee and the power of the highest shall
[45:25] overshadow thee
[45:26] therefore also that Holy thing which
[45:30] shall be born of thee shall be called
[45:33] The Son of
[45:47] God and behold I cousin Elizabeth she
[45:51] hath also conceived a son in her old age
[45:56] and this is the sixth month with her who
[45:59] was called
[46:10] Baron for with God nothing shall be
[46:21] impossible and Mary said behold the hand
[46:26] made of the Lord be it unto me according
[46:30] to Thy
[46:31] word and the angel departed from
[46:42] her amen thank the musicians may be
[46:48] seated for with God nothing shall be
[46:54] impossible I like the response of
[46:59] Mary be it unto me according to Thy
[47:05] word the best thing we can
[47:09] do is believe his
[47:12] word and do his
[47:15] work be it unto me according to his
[47:19] word I like
[47:22] that that's what Mary
[47:24] did and she's known throughout
[47:29] history because she believed the angel
[47:32] of the
[47:34] Lord and she was willing to do the will
[47:37] of
[47:40] God that's
[47:44] who now
[47:47] what now we're going to go from what man
[47:51] was
[47:54] before the Jesus Christ was
[47:59] born to when he was
[48:02] born and to the condition that we're in
[48:04] right
[48:07] now now let's look forward to the
[48:10] condition that we are right
[48:14] now we're really good at trying to
[48:17] condemn
[48:21] people let's see what brother Braham
[48:24] says about that
[48:27] and let's see what Jesus did for the
[48:33] people now Luke 2 uh verse 1-
[48:42] 17 Jesus Christ was born of a
[48:47] virgin and it came to pass in those days
[48:51] that there went out a decree from Caesar
[48:54] Augustus that all the world should be
[49:05] taxed and this taxing was first made by
[49:10] uh
[49:11] cras was governor of
[49:17] Syria and now went to be taxed everyone
[49:21] into his own
[49:24] City
[49:26] and Joseph also went up From Galilee out
[49:29] of the city of Nazareth into Judea unto
[49:33] the city of David which is called
[49:36] Bethlehem because he was of the House of
[49:40] and the lineage of
[49:52] DAV to be taxed with Mary his spouse
[49:55] wife being great with
[50:02] child and so it was that while they were
[50:06] there the days were accomplished that
[50:09] she should be
[50:14] delivered and she brought forth her
[50:17] firstborn son and wrapped him in SW
[50:21] swaddling clothes and laid him in the
[50:24] manger because there was no room for
[50:26] them in the
[50:36] end so Mary after believing she gave
[50:40] birth to a
[50:45] child in
[50:47] 1949 uh December 25th brother bran
[50:50] preached a message called the deity of
[50:52] Jesus
[50:54] Christ
[51:00] on line 37 it
[51:04] says we are today all over the world is
[51:09] being celebrated the birth of Jesus
[51:12] which is which now is just a
[51:23] tradition or
[51:26] traditional Jesus was not born on
[51:29] December the 5th or nothing like or
[51:33] December the 25th we know that's
[51:44] impossible the hills of Juda was full of
[51:47] snow at the time so how could it be
[51:54] that
[51:59] Jesus commonly by astrology so forth and
[52:02] by all of it was born first
[52:07] around first of April so when it was
[52:24] springtime but this is a day which is
[52:28] all right just set aside to Worship in
[52:31] Memorial of his coming of the
[52:42] world so we as Christians we celebrate
[52:48] that knowing it's not uh December
[52:53] 25th but we we celebrate it we have
[52:58] children we have
[53:00] grandchildren and they want to celebrate
[53:03] the birth of Jesus
[53:06] Christ difference is we don't tell them
[53:09] of uh Santa Claus or anything like
[53:15] that we tell them the
[53:18] word and their children we must
[53:21] understand
[53:23] that one of the greatest gifts that God
[53:26] ever gave to the world was Jesus
[53:34] Christ that we know
[53:36] that and I want to speak this morning
[53:40] upon the his
[53:42] deity who he
[53:50] is so many has him as a little baby
[53:54] laying out out there in in the cradle
[53:57] and so
[54:04] forth but that was just one of the
[54:08] pictures just one of the settings sport
[54:12] of the drama to bring it up to what he
[54:16] really is he
[54:24] deity
[54:29] and he said in the scriptures of his
[54:32] coming he will he would been spoke of
[54:35] since the days of John Plum back even
[54:39] into Genesis it was prophesized that the
[54:43] woman's seed would bruise the Serpent's
[54:54] head
[55:03] Genesis 3:15 promised this child child
[55:07] uh Christ
[55:12] Jesus and he has been down all all the
[55:17] prophets most every Prophet that was
[55:21] ever wrote in the Bible spoke of his
[55:24] first and second Advent when he will
[55:27] come to the
[55:39] world Jesus comes three times he came
[55:42] the first time to redeem his church he
[55:45] comes the second time to receive his
[55:47] church he comes the third time with this
[55:50] church everything in the Bible travels
[55:54] in trinities threes but all in one
[56:13] Christ he remember the first time to
[56:17] redeem his church the second time to
[56:20] receive his church the third time with
[56:23] his church as king and
[56:35] queen see man had fallen from Adam
[56:39] throughout
[56:43] history man was born in sin shaped in
[56:47] iniquity come to this world speaking
[56:53] Liv Psalm 515 and Psalm
[57:00] 583 man was lost out of the will of
[57:06] God he needed help he could not live up
[57:10] to the
[57:14] laws Moses laws that were given back in
[57:18] Exodus man needed
[57:23] help
[57:26] man needed help from
[57:31] himself he was in
[57:33] sin and he had no way back to
[57:38] [Music]
[57:40] God God by his for knowledge provided a
[57:45] lamb a sacrifice and atonement for
[57:49] [Music]
[57:53] man
[57:56] Jesus was born as a lamb a gift offering
[58:01] unto
[58:06] man for God so loved the
[58:10] world that he gave his only begotten
[58:16] son that whosoever believed in
[58:20] him should not perish but have
[58:23] everlasting life
[58:26] I've told that to the
[58:29] youth I test the
[58:32] youth I want the youth to never forget
[58:36] that never forget that
[58:40] scripture John
[58:43] 3:16 for God sent not his son unto the
[58:47] world to condemn the
[58:49] world but that the world through him
[58:52] might be
[58:53] saved
[59:00] he that believeth on him is not
[59:03] condemned but he that believeth not is
[59:06] condemned already because he has not
[59:08] believed in the name of the only
[59:10] begotten Son of
[59:20] God Romans
[59:23] 56
[59:26] for when we were yet without Strength In
[59:30] Due Time Christ died for the
[59:39] ungodly for
[59:41] scarcely for a righteous man one will
[59:45] die yet per adventure for a good man
[59:49] some would even Dare To
[59:53] Die
[1:00:00] verse eight but God
[1:00:03] condemneth or God commendeth his love
[1:00:08] towards
[1:00:10] us in that while we were yet sinners
[1:00:14] Christ died for
[1:00:22] us much more than being now justified by
[1:00:26] his blood we shall be saved from the
[1:00:30] Wrath through
[1:00:38] him for if when we were enemies we were
[1:00:43] reconcile
[1:00:44] reconciled to God by the death of his
[1:00:48] son much more being
[1:00:50] reconciled we should we shall be Sav by
[1:00:55] his
[1:01:02] [Music]
[1:01:04] life and not only so but we also join
[1:01:08] God through our Lord Jesus Christ by
[1:01:11] whom we have now received
[1:01:23] atonement so
[1:01:25] reconciliation of God and
[1:01:29] humankind through Jesus Christ is the
[1:01:40] atonement now
[1:01:43] where where was he to be
[1:01:46] born you know we heard a message on
[1:01:51] Wednesday called why little Bethlehem
[1:01:56] it's a really good message that brother
[1:01:58] BR speak spoke
[1:01:59] [Music]
[1:02:02] on you should go back and listen to it
[1:02:04] when you have
[1:02:07] time but Micah
[1:02:11] 52 King James
[1:02:14] version but thou

[1:02:24] thousand thousands of Judah yet out of

[1:02:31] to be ruler in Israel whose going forth
[1:02:36] have been from of old from
[1:02:53] Everlasting
[1:02:55] 1958
[1:02:57] 1228 why little Bethlehem brother Braham
[1:03:00] says the
[1:03:08] following line
[1:03:11] 83 and it was well represented in Jesus
[1:03:16] the beloved one years later the son of
[1:03:20] David who was to come to fulfill all
[1:03:23] things that had been
[1:03:36] promised this little city Bethlehem is
[1:03:40] where this taken
[1:03:44] place and it was on the same little
[1:03:47] judian Hills where David had hearded his
[1:03:50] sheep many years later that the angels
[1:03:54] sang their First Noel on the hills of
[1:03:57] Juda overlooking
[1:04:13] Bethlehem The First Noel unto thee is
[1:04:16] born in the city of David Christ the
[1:04:19] Lord that's Luke
[1:04:23] 211

[1:04:35] sing it wasn't at Jerusalem the big
[1:04:38] church neither was it at

[1:04:44] they had had the religious
[1:04:46] denominational worship all the
[1:04:53] time
[1:05:08] but it was in little bethleem where the
[1:05:10] spirit of God had been moving in
[1:05:12] mysterious ways bringing forth something
[1:05:16] it was
[1:05:23] there
[1:05:26] it was there where Christ had to come it

[1:05:53] son
[1:05:55] it shelter and housed in this little
[1:05:58] Fortress the king of kings and Lord of
[1:06:07] Lord for not only did Samuel come to
[1:06:10] pour out the anointing oil but God
[1:06:14] poured out upon him and upon the world
[1:06:18] remember that upon the world Christ the
[1:06:23] lord
[1:06:36] upon the
[1:06:38] world the Angels heralded his coming and
[1:06:43] sang to the Shepherds on the

[1:12:48] David the Key of David was not David the
[1:12:53] king of Israel all
[1:13:03] Israel and is not Jesus the son of David
[1:13:07] according to the fact that he will sit
[1:13:10] upon the throne of David in the
[1:13:12] Millennium and Reign and rule over his
[1:13:16] Heritage
[1:13:22] know

[1:13:29] David signifies that it is
[1:13:33] Jesus who will bring in the
[1:13:42] Millennium he who has a keys to death
[1:13:46] hell will raise up his own that they may
[1:13:51] share in his reign of righteousness upon

[1:14:24] HS to what he has purchased for

[1:14:39] once as a father he was surrounded by
[1:14:43] the Angels the archangels the sheram the

[1:14:51] crying holy holy holy is the Lord God of
[1:15:12] hosts such was his Holiness that no man
[1:15:16] could approach
[1:15:20] him but now we see him in the
[1:15:26] church sharing his own Holiness with
[1:15:32] us until in him we have become the very
[1:15:36] righteousness of
[1:15:42] God and there he stands Jesus perfect
[1:15:49] everything the lily of the valley the
[1:15:52] bright and Morning Star the feris of

[1:17:10] and full of
[1:17:17] Glory in the midst of the church he
[1:17:20] stands and will and we will sing his
[1:17:23] praise for he the mighty conqueror is
[1:17:28] head over the church which is his
[1:17:41] bride he bought that
[1:17:44] bride he owns her she is his and his
[1:17:49] alone and he cares for
[1:17:52] her
[1:17:53] he is our King and we are his kingdom
[1:17:56] his eternal
[1:18:04] possession in questions and
[1:18:08] answers number four in question
[1:18:15] 392 the church age
[1:18:18] ends and has blacked
[1:18:21] out the brightest is called we have
[1:18:25] already entered into the tribulation
[1:18:28] question
[1:18:39] mark no no you're I I wish I could have
[1:18:45] I could just have more time on that see
[1:18:49] the bride when she's taken from the
[1:18:53] church then the church age will
[1:19:08] cease goes into chaos the bride goes
[1:19:12] into glory and the tribulation sets in
[1:19:16] upon the sleeping virgin for three and
[1:19:18] half and a half years while Israel is
[1:19:22] getting its
[1:19:24] prophecy then tribulation sets upon
[1:19:28] Israel and then comes a battle of bar
[1:19:33] which destroys all
[1:19:51] things
[1:19:57] the bride returns back with the groom
[1:20:01] for a thousand years the Millennium
[1:20:04] Reign after that comes a white Throne
[1:20:07] judgment after that comes the new
[1:20:11] heavens and the new Earth and the new
[1:20:14] city coming down from God out of Heaven
[1:20:18] eternity and time Blends
[1:20:21] together
[1:20:41] we're at the end
[1:20:43] time we're waiting for that
[1:20:47] Resurrection now
[1:20:51] when I'm about
[1:20:53] 2024 years ago is when Christianity
[1:21:02] began Christians have been
[1:21:09] criticized
[1:21:11] killed and maybe most of it has been by
[1:21:15] the people who profess to be
[1:21:21] Christians and today we have about a
[1:21:24] thousand different
[1:21:29] religions but God before the foundation
[1:21:32] of the world predestinated
[1:21:38] us God knew we needed a
[1:21:42] savior he provided a
[1:21:45] lamb first Peter
[1:21:49] 1:19 but with the precious blood blood
[1:21:53] of
[1:21:54] Christ as of a lamb without blemish or
[1:21:58] without
[1:22:08] spot contamination who verily was
[1:22:12] foreordained before the foundation of
[1:22:14] the world but was manifested in these
[1:22:17] last times for
[1:22:21] you
[1:22:26] Revelations
[1:22:28] 138 and all that dwell upon the Earth
[1:22:31] shall worship Him whose names are not
[1:22:34] written in the Lamb's Book
[1:22:36] alive of the lamb slain be from the
[1:22:41] foundation of the
[1:22:51] world
[1:22:53] then the last question is
[1:22:57] why for God so loved the
[1:23:01] world that he gave his only begotten
[1:23:05] son that whosoever believed in him shall
[1:23:08] not perish but have everlasting
[1:23:15] life uh in Ephesians
[1:23:20] uh the Ephesians Church
[1:23:26] we're almost done let me just read a
[1:23:28] couple more
[1:23:31] things listen listen to this real
[1:23:36] closely God's intention for his
[1:23:40] creation man is to be is to express his
[1:23:51] words Genesis Adam was given the word to
[1:23:55] live
[1:24:01] by a life lived by the
[1:24:07] word would be the word
[1:24:15] expressed I like that
[1:24:17] quote a life lived by the word would be
[1:24:23] word
[1:24:29] expressed think about that for a little
[1:24:33] bit that is true is it not but did Adam
[1:24:38] live by that word no because he was to
[1:24:43] live by every word and he failed to take
[1:24:47] heed to every
[1:24:51] word
[1:25:04] then there arose Moses what a great and
[1:25:08] mighty man he was yet he also failed to
[1:25:12] live by every word and that Prophet the
[1:25:16] type of the great prophet to come failed
[1:25:19] in
[1:25:20] Anger to obey the
[1:25:39] word and there was also David the great
[1:25:42] king of Israel a man after God's Own
[1:25:45] Heart he fell by adultery when he was
[1:25:51] tempted
[1:25:59] but eventually in the fullness of time
[1:26:03] there came one the head even Jesus who
[1:26:08] also must be tempted to see if he would
[1:26:11] live by every word that proceeded out of
[1:26:14] the mouth of
[1:26:21] God
[1:26:31] then was Satan
[1:26:35] foiled for here was one who live by it
[1:26:40] is written and that Masterpiece of God
[1:26:46] overcame by reflecting God's
[1:26:51] word
[1:27:00] then was a manifested perfect one given
[1:27:03] to the Cross as a perfect Lamb of God
[1:27:07] for the perfect
[1:27:18] sacrifice and on the tree he received
[1:27:22] the wounds unto death that we by him and
[1:27:27] because of him might eat of the tree of
[1:27:31] life and then that life freely given
[1:27:35] would enable us to
[1:27:37] overcome and express the word of
[1:27:51] God
[1:28:00] and now these sons of God who by him
[1:28:04] overcome and give him the privilege of
[1:28:08] the paradise of God and the constant
[1:28:11] Fellowship of Jesus
[1:28:21] Christ
[1:28:27] the sons of
[1:28:29] God who
[1:28:32] overcame there will never be
[1:28:36] more be any separation from
[1:28:42] him whether he
[1:28:45] goes the bride will
[1:28:48] go what is his he shares with his
[1:28:54] beloved on a joint air
[1:29:04] relationship the secret things will be
[1:29:09] revealed the dark things will make be
[1:29:12] made
[1:29:14] plain and we shall know as we are
[1:29:20] known
[1:29:22] and we shall be like
[1:29:25] him oh I like that one we shall be like
[1:29:30] him this is the
[1:29:33] Heritage
[1:29:35] inheritance of the Overcomer who has
[1:29:38] overcome by the blood of the lamb and
[1:29:42] the word of his testimony of Jesus
[1:29:50] Christ
[1:29:55] we have an inheritance waiting for
[1:29:59] us we will be with
[1:30:02] him we will be like unto
[1:30:05] him but we must live his
[1:30:09] word oey every
[1:30:16] word I like
[1:30:19] that Romans 1:16
[1:30:22] R running out of time here for I am not
[1:30:26] ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it
[1:30:30] is the power of God unto
[1:30:33] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[1:30:37] the Jew first and also to the
[1:30:49] Greek for wherein is the righteousness
[1:30:53] of God revealed from Faith to Faith as
[1:30:58] it is written the just shall live by
[1:31:09] faith if you have a scoffield
[1:31:14] Bible there's a pretty good definition
[1:31:19] there on the bottom where you have the
[1:31:22] the definitions
[1:31:26] there and he tries to explain
[1:31:31] salvation
[1:31:33] Salvation sometimes we we uh think about
[1:31:37] that
[1:31:39] word the Hebrew and Greek words for
[1:31:47] salvation imply the idea of Deliverance
[1:31:56] safety
[1:31:59] preservation
[1:32:01] healing
[1:32:04] soundness salvation is a great inclusive
[1:32:08] word of the
[1:32:13] Gospel Gathering into itself s all the
[1:32:17] Redemptive acts and processes
[1:32:25] as
[1:32:28] justification
[1:32:30] Redemption
[1:32:31] Grace
[1:32:34] propitiation
[1:32:36] imputation
[1:32:39] forgiveness
[1:32:41] sanctification and
[1:32:44] glorification salvation is in three
[1:32:50] tenses
[1:32:52] the believer has been saved from the
[1:32:55] guilt and penalty of
[1:33:00] sin the believer is being saved from the
[1:33:04] habit and domain Dominion of
[1:33:11] sin the believer is to be saved in the
[1:33:16] sense of entire Conformity to Christ
[1:33:26] there's a lot involved in
[1:33:35] Salvation now in
[1:33:38] closing I didn't write this on
[1:33:42] there but I want you to hear this
[1:33:47] story and we we talked about the
[1:33:50] world
[1:33:52] sometimes we want to condemn everyone
[1:33:54] that's not like
[1:33:57] us or don't talk like
[1:34:00] this don't dress like
[1:34:05] this um I I've talked
[1:34:08] to and talked to my daughter about this
[1:34:10] a couple of
[1:34:15] times cuz we when we see
[1:34:20] sin and we see people acting the way
[1:34:23] they
[1:34:27] act sometimes we want God to really get
[1:34:32] them you think well they they they need
[1:34:35] God needs to get
[1:34:40] them and that's not
[1:34:44] right and brother Braham has a pretty
[1:34:47] good story on
[1:34:50] this
[1:34:53] I forgive
[1:34:56] you didn't
[1:34:59] I I forgive you didn't
[1:35:03] I in
[1:35:05] 1955
[1:35:07] 0222 Jehovah
[1:35:12] Gyra in
[1:35:15] closing I want you to hear this real
[1:35:20] closely I I know I've read a
[1:35:24] lot but I know if I
[1:35:27] read we can base that on God's
[1:35:30] word the message of the
[1:35:33] hour and I believe
[1:35:36] both on line
[1:35:40] 66 I went up walked down the road to a
[1:35:44] little
[1:35:46] piece and went into an ordinary little
[1:35:50] restaurant Little Road
[1:36:05] place and when I walked in behind the
[1:36:09] door the door shut behind me real
[1:36:17] hard and I looked and there stood a
[1:36:22] policeman with his arm around the woman
[1:36:26] playing a slot
[1:36:35] machine and uh gambling is illegal in
[1:36:43] Ohio and I thought the law the very
[1:36:48] law and the man was My AG age perhaps
[1:36:53] married and had a family at home I
[1:36:57] thought oh my corruption and
[1:37:16] filth I looked back at a table back
[1:37:20] there and some young
[1:37:23] boys and a lady about a little young
[1:37:27] lady about
[1:37:29] 18 20 years old they thought they
[1:37:34] ought to been in Sunday school
[1:37:50] somewhere
[1:37:55] those boys
[1:37:58] drinking back there and oh the way they
[1:38:02] was abusing that
[1:38:10] girl and her standing there and letting
[1:38:14] them do
[1:38:19] it and I happened to look over to my
[1:38:23] right and there was an elderly woman
[1:38:26] sitting there with little old clothes on
[1:38:30] she ought to have had on real
[1:38:35] old about
[1:38:38] 65 maybe
[1:38:50] better
[1:38:55] and she had a purple makeup on her mouth
[1:39:00] and on her
[1:39:01] toenails and her arms poor old thing was
[1:39:07] flabby and her hair was
[1:39:10] boyish
[1:39:12] globed in little Kinky Curls up on it
[1:39:17] she was trying to light a cigarette
[1:39:22] drunk and two drunken men with
[1:39:50] her
[1:39:53] I thought oh
[1:39:59] God how can you look at such as that I
[1:40:04] thought my little Sarah Rebecca going to
[1:40:08] have to be raised up in a world like
[1:40:12] that God why don't you just destroy the
[1:40:16] thing take it all off I don't see how
[1:40:22] you can stand it to look at such a thing
[1:40:26] as
[1:40:47] that I was standing there criticizing
[1:40:50] her
[1:40:52] the two drunks with her got up and went
[1:40:55] out to be gone for just a while and just
[1:41:00] then I felt something moving on me I
[1:41:03] went back and sat down at a little booth
[1:41:07] on the side nobody paid any attention to
[1:41:10] me yet I was kind of dark it was kind of
[1:41:14] dark in the corner and there God gave me
[1:41:17] a vision and changed my mind
[1:41:21] and
[1:41:49] things
[1:41:53] okay do I have your
[1:41:57] attention I looked there and saw the
[1:42:02] world and around the world was looked
[1:42:05] like a red
[1:42:08] streak just as just just a
[1:42:13] spray something said this is the blood
[1:42:16] of the Lord Jesus who died to save
[1:42:36] Sinners that's the reason God can
[1:42:40] destroy he can't see
[1:42:44] her he
[1:42:49] can't
[1:42:53] every moral being has a
[1:42:56] right and has a right to accept their
[1:43:01] salvation
[1:43:03] until they
[1:43:06] die and go beyond that
[1:43:18] blood they don't have to stand in
[1:43:21] judgment they're already judged the day
[1:43:25] you eat thereof the day you die but as
[1:43:28] long as you're here you got a right to
[1:43:32] the tree of life if you'll accept
[1:43:49] it
[1:43:52] everyone has a
[1:43:55] chance what condition you're
[1:43:59] in you have an
[1:44:03] opportunity as long as you have breath
[1:44:05] to
[1:44:08] breathe you have that
[1:44:13] opportunity and he said that's your
[1:44:18] sin and I seen that blood that the blood
[1:44:22] of
[1:44:23] Jesus to my own sins was acting like a
[1:44:29] bumper if it had been if it had went
[1:44:33] beyond that stream of blood there that
[1:44:36] was around the earth when he died to
[1:44:40] settle the sin question if it have went
[1:44:45] beyond that then God would have killed
[1:44:48] me you be
[1:44:59] [Music]
[1:45:12] just like the bumper to the car to keep
[1:45:15] your car from being hurt the bumper
[1:45:18] catches the lick and the blood of Jesus
[1:45:22] Christ catches your
[1:45:36] sins father forgive them they don't know
[1:45:40] what they're doing father forgive
[1:45:47] them Luke
[1:45:49] 2334
[1:45:51] if we can have the musicians and if you
[1:45:52] can
[1:45:55] stand the blood is there protecting each
[1:45:58] and every one of
[1:46:01] us protecting us and protecting us and
[1:46:04] protecting
[1:46:07] us line 7 the and I look there there my
[1:46:13] name laying there on an old book wrote
[1:46:18] all kinds of things
[1:46:23] condemned I crawled up to his feet and
[1:46:26] said Lord
[1:46:27] Jesus will you forgive me
[1:46:30] then I didn't mean I said you mean my
[1:46:35] sins hurt you like that said
[1:46:49] yes
[1:47:02] he took his hand and dipped it in his
[1:47:06] side took his finger and wrote across
[1:47:09] the book
[1:47:18] pardon pardon put it back behind him
[1:47:22] like that put his arms together and
[1:47:26] looked at me he
[1:47:28] said I forgive
[1:47:30] you didn't
[1:47:41] I I said yes Lord I love you for
[1:47:47] it he said but why are you you
[1:47:50] condemning her then

[1:47:58] else but
