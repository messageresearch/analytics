[52:33] time amen amen and we ask
[52:37] God that everything that is

[53:00] right amen amen so this morning I'd like
[53:04] to speak to you from my
[53:07] heart I've been asking God to help
[53:11] me and a few weeks ago the Lord laid
[53:15] these thoughts in my
[53:18] heart and you
[53:21] know we have the
[53:23] greatest message there ever was
[53:27] [Music]
[53:29] and if you let this
[53:32] message work in your life it will
[53:34] transform
[53:38] you it's the same power that was spoken
[53:40] by almighty God from the very
[53:45] beginning and if that power of
[53:49] God was able to create
[53:52] worlds create this world that you're
[53:55] standing on
[53:56] [Music]
[53:58] what will that power do to me and
[54:03] you think about these things this
[54:07] morning I believe we're living in one of
[54:09] the greatest times that there
[54:14] is these are the closing
[54:17] moments you know what but I believe God
[54:20] left the best for

[54:28] you at another
[54:29] [Music]
[54:31] age amen you know we hear a great men in

[54:36] ages amen but you
[54:39] know as I said God Save The Best For
[54:45] Last thank you Jesus you just have to
[54:49] identify
[54:52] yourself and always believe that God
[54:55] makes no mistake
[54:59] amen we may see a
[55:02] mistake but God didn't make a
[55:05] mistake he chose you to be in this
[55:09] age the most deceitful
[55:12] age but he knew you would not be
[55:16] deceived amen so we thank God this
[55:21] morning Brothers I feel like preaching
[55:23] and I ain't even read the word
[55:27] you say brother Frank that's the way you
[55:29] are no that's the atmosphere you've
[55:33] already amen amen you know you get into
[55:37] a place where they're playing and
[55:39] singing and you know all this kind of
[55:41] worldly
[55:46] music Brothers if there's worldly music
[55:51] playing Brothers you're not even in the
[55:54] door
[55:56] and you're already Clapping Your
[55:59] Hands you grab your partner and start
[56:04] dancing why because the
[56:07] atmosphere has flown Beyond the
[56:12] Doors and it's caught
[56:14] you and that's the
[56:17] key we need to create an
[56:21] atmosphere where God can come and speak
[56:24] to our hearts
[56:28] we believe he will tonight this
[56:31] morning amen so God bless you once
[56:35] again amen amen if we could go to the

[59:15] morning that you would bless your

[1:00:00] people for you said that the anointing

[1:00:10] day where your children would be taught
[1:00:12] of
[1:00:14] God we believe it's this day
[1:00:18] Lord so father we commit ourselves to
[1:00:21] you
[1:00:22] now in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:26] forgive every
[1:00:27] sin for we ask these things in the
[1:00:30] precious name of thy beloved
[1:00:33] Son amen amen and amen amen God bless
[1:00:38] you you may be
[1:00:41] seated amen
[1:00:44] amen so this
[1:00:47] morning also in the Book of
[1:00:52] Matthew I'd like to read a a scripture
[1:00:55] there
[1:00:58] and Jesus
[1:01:00] said and Jesus knew their thoughts and
[1:01:02] said unto them every Kingdom divided
[1:01:04] against itself is brought to Desolation
[1:01:07] and every city or house divided against
[1:01:10] itself shall not
[1:01:21] stand as a title this morning I would
[1:01:24] like to speak on a House
[1:01:29] Divided and and and as a as a topic I
[1:01:33] would like to speak on when the enemy
[1:01:36] comes in like the
[1:01:40] flood you know Jesus said over in
[1:01:43] Matthew
[1:01:45] 10 that a Man's enemies would be from
[1:01:48] his
[1:01:51] household and we want to take some
[1:01:54] thoughts this morning
[1:01:58] because we believe that we are up
[1:02:00] against the greatest enemy That Ever
[1:02:02] Walked on this
[1:02:06] Earth but you know even though many
[1:02:09] times things seem to to come against
[1:02:16] us and no matter what the devil will
[1:02:20] send we have a
[1:02:22] promise that when the enemy comes in
[1:02:25] like a flood
[1:02:28] God will lift up a standard against
[1:02:31] him I believe that we are living in an
[1:02:35] age where the enemy has come in like a
[1:02:40] flood
[1:02:43] now I want to just set here a little
[1:02:49] foundation so that you can kind of
[1:02:52] understand what we're going to speak
[1:02:53] here this morning
[1:02:57] now Jesus tells us here in verse 25 of
[1:03:00] Matthew
[1:03:03] 12 he says every city or House
[1:03:08] Divided now Jesus never said a divided
[1:03:15] house but he says A House
[1:03:19] Divided now and you may wonder and say
[1:03:22] brother Frank doesn't it mean the same
[1:03:27] in many instances it does mean the same
[1:03:29] A House Divided or a divided
[1:03:34] house but a divided
[1:03:37] house is a house that wants to go into
[1:03:40] two
[1:03:44] directions basically that's what it
[1:03:46] means it's a divided
[1:03:50] house but A House
[1:03:54] Divided it speaks of something more
[1:03:57] critical than just an
[1:04:00] opinion it speaks of something more than
[1:04:03] just which way do I
[1:04:08] go one of the greatest
[1:04:12] presidents when Abraham Lincoln took
[1:04:14] office
[1:04:17] Abol in his
[1:04:20] speech Abraham Lincoln took this
[1:04:23] scripture Abraham Lincoln
[1:04:26] here in Matthew
[1:04:29] 12 and as he was was given his
[1:04:34] speech understand a little bit of
[1:04:37] background he had come into a country
[1:04:41] that was
[1:04:44] divided and he used this
[1:04:47] scripture and the title of his message
[1:04:50] was A House
[1:04:53] Divided because he was coming into a
[1:04:56] country that was going to be pulled
[1:04:58] apart if something wasn't
[1:05:03] done amen at that time the country was
[1:05:06] divided because of
[1:05:10] slavery and it was pulling the country
[1:05:14] apart
[1:05:16] Brothers think about what's happening
[1:05:18] this
[1:05:20] morning we have a house divided
[1:05:25] may God raise up men like Abraham
[1:05:29] Lincoln abrah lincol that'll stand up
[1:05:32] and call what truth is
[1:05:36] truth and Abraham Lincoln said we have a
[1:05:39] house divided Abraham
[1:05:42] lincol and what what did it take to
[1:05:45] unite this country back together was a
[1:05:48] civil
[1:05:53] war amen amen and brothers and
[1:05:56] sisters I hope that I don't hurt any
[1:06:00] feelings I'm not here to hurt
[1:06:03] feelings but I'd Rather somebody tell me
[1:06:06] the truth
[1:06:08] now I'd Rather somebody take the Bible
[1:06:11] and and explain it to
[1:06:15] me than before it's too
[1:06:18] late now Brothers we
[1:06:22] understand that this morning
[1:06:26] I believe the scripture in
[1:06:28] Isaiah it fits perfect for this
[1:06:33] morning I believe the enemy has come in
[1:06:36] like a
[1:06:37] flood and a flood is not just
[1:06:41] something that's directed just to a
[1:06:45] person but a natural
[1:06:49] flood has no
[1:06:51] respect it'll try to destroy everything
[1:06:54] in its path
[1:06:57] and that is what the enemy is trying to
[1:07:00] do he's trying to destroy everything in
[1:07:03] its
[1:07:04] path well it might sound
[1:07:07] horrible but
[1:07:09] remember amen that God said that when he
[1:07:13] comes in like a
[1:07:15] flood I'm going to lift up a
[1:07:19] standard amen and we're here
[1:07:22] Brothers to be part of that standard
[1:07:26] and to lift it up against all those
[1:07:28] things that are
[1:07:30] coming amen I believe this
[1:07:34] morning
[1:07:36] Brothers you know I'm not saying that
[1:07:38] I'm a religious person or
[1:07:41] anything but I know when God has sent me
[1:07:44] with a
[1:07:46] message that one thing I am
[1:07:50] sure amen and that's the kind of people
[1:07:53] we want not just me Brothers
[1:07:57] but brothers that will stand
[1:07:59] up and lift up a
[1:08:02] standard that's the promise of this
[1:08:05] hour to stand with the word of God for
[1:08:08] this
[1:08:12] hour now
[1:08:14] notice so we
[1:08:16] understand what is a
[1:08:19] standard just so that we can get right
[1:08:21] into this
[1:08:24] message what is a
[1:08:26] standard something that identifies
[1:08:29] you it's a
[1:08:32] principle now
[1:08:34] Brothers this morning I asked
[1:08:36] God I want to speak the
[1:08:39] truth I want this message to be
[1:08:42] real I want to be able to grab it from
[1:08:45] here and say this is the
[1:08:48] truth I don't want to make up
[1:08:50] stuff I want to be able to say see this
[1:08:53] is what happened
[1:08:56] Brothers what is a
[1:08:58] standard many of us still
[1:09:02] remember back in 911 how many
[1:09:06] remember you even remember where you
[1:09:10] were before
[1:09:12] 911 brother this country hated
[1:09:16] itself the whites against the
[1:09:20] colorss all kind of prejudism running
[1:09:23] everywhere is that right
[1:09:26] this country was
[1:09:29] separated but as soon as 911
[1:09:34] occurred we forgot about our
[1:09:39] prejudism the enemy came
[1:09:41] in and what did we
[1:09:44] do we rallied
[1:09:47] around amen the flag of
[1:09:51] America everybody was waving a flag
[1:09:56] the cars were waving
[1:09:58] flags people had Flags in their
[1:10:02] home because the enemy
[1:10:05] came and America lifted up a
[1:10:09] standard and everybody came and United
[1:10:13] together and that's the way it
[1:10:15] is the enemy's coming in like a
[1:10:19] flood and God is lifting up a
[1:10:23] stand and that is his word
[1:10:26] that takes all of
[1:10:28] us to unite around the word of
[1:10:33] God
[1:10:34] amen amen if we can do it in the
[1:10:39] natural how much more in the
[1:10:42] spiritual
[1:10:51] amen is that the truth
[1:10:55] we forgot about all our
[1:10:57] differences we only had one
[1:11:01] objective to stand shoulder to
[1:11:04] shoulder to stand hand in
[1:11:07] hand and to pray for the
[1:11:09] country that we never prayed
[1:11:12] for but it took the enemy to
[1:11:16] come and do all this
[1:11:20] damage for us to wake
[1:11:23] up and realize
[1:11:26] my fight is not against my fellow
[1:11:30] citizen an enemy came
[1:11:33] in
[1:11:35] Brothers in this
[1:11:37] message in this
[1:11:40] message that is not
[1:11:44] happening we're like post
[1:11:48] 911 amen but he's coming in like a
[1:11:51] flood he's coming in like a
[1:11:54] flood and and he's lift up a
[1:11:56] standard and we all have to
[1:11:59] Rally around the message of this
[1:12:02] hour amen well your brother that
[1:12:05] believes different from
[1:12:07] you is not your
[1:12:10] enemy your enemy that's not your enemy
[1:12:15] that's your
[1:12:16] enemy that's your
[1:12:18] enemy but that's what's
[1:12:20] happened and this happened in
[1:12:23] America where you can see it it should
[1:12:27] happen amongst us
[1:12:29] too where you're not looking at me and
[1:12:31] I'm not looking at
[1:12:34] you but we can stand shoulder to
[1:12:37] shoulder hand in
[1:12:39] hand and pray and pray and stand up
[1:12:45] against this flood that the enem is
[1:12:53] bring now remember
[1:12:56] amen amen Jesus said A House
[1:13:00] Divided because he knew it was something
[1:13:02] more different it was something more
[1:13:06] serious something that would
[1:13:09] cause the house to
[1:13:12] fall not just different opinions on
[1:13:14] where to
[1:13:17] go but something that was causing the
[1:13:19] church to
[1:13:23] fracture remember
[1:13:26] these have to be
[1:13:29] facts I'm not willing to stand up here
[1:13:32] and pull a rabbit out of my my hat or my
[1:13:37] sleeve these things have to be
[1:13:41] facts amen amen it has to be I will show
[1:13:45] you in just a little bit it's got to be
[1:13:47] greater than
[1:13:50] facts it's got to be truth right
[1:13:55] amen
[1:13:57] now I'm just so that you
[1:14:00] know what kind of
[1:14:03] enemy Brothers brother BR do you still
[1:14:06] believe what brother brandham
[1:14:09] said brother brandom
[1:14:11] said that the enemy was
[1:14:15] defeated the enemy Was
[1:14:18] Defeated then if he's
[1:14:21] defeated who's defeating us
[1:14:28] we're always blaming
[1:14:30] him you can't blame him if he's
[1:14:34] Defeated come on
[1:14:37] Brothers we're always blaming the
[1:14:40] devil but you know the Devil he's Sly
[1:14:43] he's
[1:14:46] deceitful he wants to keep you from
[1:14:49] looking at the
[1:14:52] truth he wants you to think think that
[1:14:55] he's the greatest
[1:14:58] enemy he's not the greatest enemy we're
[1:15:01] the greatest
[1:15:09] enemy is that
[1:15:12] right because he's
[1:15:15] defeated we're not
[1:15:18] defeated he's
[1:15:20] defeated but you got to look in the
[1:15:22] mirror and say I am my greatest enemy
[1:15:27] once you can overcome
[1:15:30] him he's
[1:15:37] defeated now watch
[1:15:39] this brother brandom said on the message
[1:15:42] Israel and the church part
[1:15:46] one he says watch it's moving out today
[1:15:49] in a terrible Force
[1:15:55] a few verses before
[1:15:58] this brother brandom takes us way back
[1:16:00] to the times of
[1:16:03] Cain and then he brings it to our
[1:16:07] day and he says notice how all those
[1:16:11] great religious
[1:16:14] men that existed at that
[1:16:17] time we had great teachers and Pharisees
[1:16:21] Grand we had priests Grandes amen amen
[1:16:26] that that knew the
[1:16:29] scriptures but when the word was made
[1:16:34] flesh they didn't recognize
[1:16:37] it listen when the word was made flesh
[1:16:41] they didn't recognize
[1:16:44] it and that's what the enemy wants us to
[1:16:50] think Brothers I believe God sent a
[1:16:54] prophet
[1:16:57] I believe that but I believe that when
[1:17:00] he stood in the
[1:17:03] Pulpit I believe that when he was
[1:17:06] praying for the
[1:17:08] sick that was no longer a
[1:17:11] man that was God in a
[1:17:15] man amen am that was God in a
[1:17:20] man I believe with all my
[1:17:23] heart I was telling my brother just a
[1:17:25] few minutes
[1:17:27] ago I was we were hearing a
[1:17:30] message and this brother comes up to
[1:17:32] brother
[1:17:35] brandham prior to that he had seen
[1:17:38] brother brandham Discerning the thoughts
[1:17:39] of the
[1:17:44] people the man steps up to brother
[1:17:48] brandham brother Bram says brother God
[1:17:51] bless you you're healed and the brother
[1:17:53] walks off
[1:17:57] and the brother had already walked not
[1:17:59] out not off the platform but he was on
[1:18:01] his way off the
[1:18:04] platform when the angel of the Lord told
[1:18:07] Brother
[1:18:09] Bram call him
[1:18:12] back in his
[1:18:14] heart he's questioning why you didn't
[1:18:17] discern his
[1:18:21] sickness and brother brandom said
[1:18:23] brother come back
[1:18:26] in your
[1:18:28] heart you're asking God why did he not
[1:18:31] discern my
[1:18:35] sickness so now in the name of the
[1:18:39] Lord you got heart
[1:18:42] trouble go home and be
[1:18:46] well who was
[1:18:48] that that was God
[1:18:52] [Applause]
[1:18:56] now
[1:18:57] notice so brother brandom says it's all
[1:19:00] right if I take off my
[1:19:03] coat
[1:19:05] amen now notice this so brother brandom
[1:19:10] says he
[1:19:12] says they could not
[1:19:16] recognize when Jesus came on the
[1:19:20] earth and
[1:19:22] brothers that is the same thing
[1:19:26] that is happening
[1:19:27] now amen amen all these great scholars
[1:19:31] in the
[1:19:33] message all these people that once used
[1:19:36] to sit in the message
[1:19:39] service you know what they've
[1:19:42] done they've taken the place of those
[1:19:44] scribes and
[1:19:48] Pharisees and
[1:19:49] now after seeing Miracle after Miracle
[1:19:53] by this prophet
[1:19:57] they can't recognize
[1:19:59] it they refuse to recognize
[1:20:03] it that's the same thing that they did
[1:20:05] back
[1:20:07] then and here's where I want to quote
[1:20:09] you
[1:20:11] something that brother brandham said
[1:20:13] that this is moving today in a terrible
[1:20:20] Force we're trying to
[1:20:23] discredit the ministry of our
[1:20:27] Prophet but watch what brother brandham
[1:20:30] said he says oh it behooves you my
[1:20:33] brother and
[1:20:35] sister to consider what you're listening
[1:20:40] at amen amen and don't ever
[1:20:46] underestimate I'm going to say it again
[1:20:49] don't ever underestimate the power
[1:20:52] Satan's power for deceiving
[1:20:57] don't you never underestimate him he's
[1:21:00] as smooth as can
[1:21:04] be it got my
[1:21:07] attention where the prophet of God said
[1:21:09] consider to what you're
[1:21:13] listening it's like if he already
[1:21:16] knew that the greatest
[1:21:20] danger in this age is social media
[1:21:26] amen social media has comeing like a
[1:21:32] flood is that right and brother brandom
[1:21:36] said you need to consider what you're
[1:21:40] listening and don't ever underestimate
[1:21:42] the
[1:21:44] Devil he's
[1:21:46] deceitful brother random said if he
[1:21:49] doesn't get you one way he'll get you
[1:21:51] another
[1:21:53] way he's become our greatest enemy not
[1:21:56] because he has
[1:21:59] power because he's
[1:22:02] deceitful he's
[1:22:04] deceitful brother brandom came to a
[1:22:08] point where he said the enemy will tell
[1:22:11] you that you got the Holy Ghost when you
[1:22:14] ain't
[1:22:20] God is that right
[1:22:25] could you
[1:22:26] imagine you got the Holy Ghost and you
[1:22:28] believe it and you ain't got
[1:22:31] it but then he also said he'll tell you
[1:22:34] you ain't got it when you do have
[1:22:37] it and what happens we're always
[1:22:42] complaining God I'm not your
[1:22:45] child why don't you give me the Holy
[1:22:48] Ghost you already got it he just told
[1:22:51] you you ain't got it
[1:22:55] that's right that's how deceitful he
[1:22:58] is and don't tell me those things don't
[1:23:02] come through our
[1:23:09] minds don't never underestimate
[1:23:13] him Brothers we preach we have
[1:23:18] revivals we preach we got
[1:23:21] ministers and we preach and we preach
[1:23:25] and we
[1:23:27] preach and the enemy is still deceiving
[1:23:37] us that didn't hurt did
[1:23:41] it is it true is it
[1:23:45] true these pulpits are never
[1:23:48] empty the people are always
[1:23:52] rejoicing then why is he still defeating
[1:23:57] us could it could it be that we don't
[1:24:00] know where he's
[1:24:02] at and the only way to know where he's
[1:24:06] at go back how he started and follow
[1:24:13] him once we know where he's
[1:24:17] at said devil you ain't going to do that
[1:24:19] to me no
[1:24:22] more but we got to know where he's
[1:24:26] at amen and and and sometimes when we
[1:24:30] uncover where it's at we don't want
[1:24:33] it we don't want to accept
[1:24:36] it it can't it can't be because I pay my
[1:24:41] tithing it can't be because I
[1:24:45] preach it can't be because I
[1:24:48] sing it can't be because I'm a member of

[1:28:18] his own
[1:28:20] kingdom but we haven't understood that

[1:37:25] would that be all
[1:37:26] right because you can
[1:37:29] see up to
[1:37:32] now the problem is not on the
[1:37:37] outside the problem is on the
[1:37:43] inside up to now you can see
[1:37:47] this
[1:37:49] now I want to go to a scripture in Job
[1:37:52] chapter 1
[1:37:58] in verse
[1:38:00] six now
[1:38:04] notice I'm keeping my eye on the
[1:38:07] clock I'm looking up there every 20
[1:38:10] minutes see I do it I do it in in 20
[1:38:13] minute
[1:38:15] sections amen amen so if it's 20 minutes
[1:38:19] and it goes up it's every 20 minutes
[1:38:21] Brothers
[1:38:23] now watch this now in Job chapter
[1:38:28] 1 in verse
[1:38:30] 6 you're familiar with
[1:38:33] this now there was a day when the sons
[1:38:37] of who of
[1:38:42] God the sons of God you know brother
[1:38:46] brandom said we were
[1:38:49] there we were
[1:38:51] there amen now notice watch here oh
[1:38:57] Brothers you could preach something on
[1:38:58] that
[1:38:59] watch there was a day when the sons of
[1:39:01] God came to present themselves before
[1:39:03] the
[1:39:06] Lord but they weren't
[1:39:09] alone and Satan came also among
[1:39:15] them he came also among
[1:39:19] them verse seven and the Lord said unto
[1:39:23] to Satan see because when the Book of
[1:39:25] Job was
[1:39:28] written because brother brandham says
[1:39:30] that the Book of Job is the oldest book
[1:39:32] in the
[1:39:35] Bible is that right amen amen at this
[1:39:40] moment at this point in
[1:39:43] time job was still in speaking terms
[1:39:46] with
[1:39:49] God amen amen he he was among the sons
[1:39:52] of God
[1:39:55] at this point he wasn't he wasn't all
[1:39:57] prideful
[1:39:59] yet amen amen and the Bible says and the
[1:40:03] Lord said unto Satan when comest thou
[1:40:06] then Satan answered the Lord and said
[1:40:08] from going to and fro in the Earth from
[1:40:11] walking up and down in
[1:40:19] it can can we say something here he's
[1:40:22] still doing the the same
[1:40:25] thing I believe it's in the message
[1:40:29] contest brother brandom says not only
[1:40:33] are you studying Satan but Satan is
[1:40:35] studying
[1:40:38] you amen
[1:40:41] amen not only are you studying him he
[1:40:44] he's also analyzing
[1:40:48] you we think that this is all one way no
[1:40:51] sir he's also he gots his on
[1:40:57] you amen so so if we go back to job
[1:41:02] one we see here that the sons of God
[1:41:06] came and presented themselves before the
[1:41:08] Lord and Satan was there with
[1:41:14] them
[1:41:16] now I don't think that anywhere Satan is
[1:41:20] is a good thing
[1:41:25] Satan never comes with good
[1:41:28] intentions he might show you something
[1:41:31] beautiful but it isn't that he wants you
[1:41:33] to get something beautiful he wants to
[1:41:34] deceive
[1:41:41] you anything that Satan gives you it's
[1:41:45] for his own
[1:41:49] gain how many is following me
[1:41:54] so we understand here that he came
[1:41:56] amongst the sons of God and even
[1:41:58] presented himself before the
[1:42:04] Lord but something
[1:42:07] happened between the first chapter of
[1:42:12] job and Revelations
[1:42:16] 12 something
[1:42:20] happened and in order for us to find
[1:42:23] find out we've got to go to the
[1:42:26] message in Revelations 12 and verse
[1:42:31] 3 in job
[1:42:33] one he's amongst the sons of God and in
[1:42:36] the presence of
[1:42:40] God but
[1:42:41] between Job 1 and Revelations
[1:42:46] 12 something
[1:42:49] happened something
[1:42:51] happened and he turned turned against
[1:42:55] God but how did he turn against
[1:42:59] God the Bible tells
[1:43:03] us and there appeared verse three and
[1:43:06] there appeared another Wonder in heaven
[1:43:08] and and and behold a great red dragon
[1:43:11] having seven heads and 10 horns and
[1:43:15] seven crowns upon his head
[1:43:27] and his tail drew the third part of the
[1:43:29] stars of heaven and did cast them to the
[1:43:32] earth and the dragon stood before the
[1:43:34] woman which was ready to be delivered
[1:43:36] and to devour her child as soon as it
[1:43:38] was
[1:43:50] born now I I want you to see
[1:43:54] this that brother brandom tells
[1:43:57] us and I know you've read it in the
[1:43:59] message especially you
[1:44:03] ministers brother brandom said the the
[1:44:05] the the the dragon didn't it's not a
[1:44:08] pale like a horse
[1:44:14] tail it's not like an animal
[1:44:18] tail it's not a a tail like you see you
[1:44:22] know on the chili it's got a hook it's
[1:44:25] not that kind of
[1:44:28] ta no Brothers It's the tale the fairy
[1:44:32] tale the story that he
[1:44:37] told it's the tale that he
[1:44:41] told in other
[1:44:44] words and here again is why you need to
[1:44:48] go to the message to truly understand
[1:44:50] the scripture
[1:44:54] now notice on the message the God of
[1:44:57] this evil
[1:44:59] age brother Bram
[1:45:01] said it was Satan's
[1:45:06] ambition it was his
[1:45:09] ambition you know what the word ambition
[1:45:12] means it means a desire to achieve
[1:45:18] something Brothers the only ambition
[1:45:21] that we should have is the Vision that
[1:45:23] God gives
[1:45:27] us not to be great amongst
[1:45:31] ourselves not to be the biggest
[1:45:34] church or the biggest
[1:45:37] preachers that doesn't come from God
[1:45:39] that comes from
[1:45:42] Satan amen amen I'm going to be the best
[1:45:45] one I'm going to be the best one and I'm
[1:45:49] going to no brothers that does not come
[1:45:53] from
[1:45:54] God Amen what what what is our
[1:45:58] subject when the enemy comes in like a

[1:49:40] other that's the
[1:49:45] Bible it wasn't the bird that was
[1:49:50] pecking Satan knew that if he got on the
[1:49:52] end

[1:51:21] enemies
[1:51:26] we
[1:51:27] have amen am those people on social
[1:51:31] media that were in this
[1:51:34] message now have turned against this
[1:51:37] message turned against this the
[1:51:40] prophet when the enemy comes in like a
[1:51:44] flock God is going to lift up a
[1:51:47] stand and I believe that's what he's
[1:51:49] doing this
[1:51:50] morning bringing us back to the standard
[1:51:53] of his
[1:51:54] word that's what we need
[1:51:57] Brothers to
[1:51:59] realize that we are the
[1:52:05] problems amen amen quit quit looking at
[1:52:08] the Robin quit looking at the bird
[1:52:10] picking at the
[1:52:12] app Brothers it's already amongst
[1:52:16] us we just need to identify him how he
[1:52:19] works
[1:52:29] on the message
[1:52:32] sayen brother you just raise your
[1:52:35] hand when I'm out of when I'm out of
[1:52:40] time I don't know maybe brother Santana
[1:52:42] can go out there I won't look that way
[1:52:43] I'll look over
[1:52:46] there you just tell me when I'm out of
[1:52:48] time
[1:52:49] brother if you if you don't stop me I'm
[1:52:51] going to continue going

[1:52:55] amen no I respect this
[1:52:59] church and I love you more than you what
[1:53:01] you

[1:53:08] paragraph 65 the message sat e uh Eden
[1:53:11] preached
[1:53:15] 1965 brother Bram said now I'm I want to
[1:53:18] move pretty
[1:53:20] fast he said he said he would exalt
[1:53:23] himself above the most
[1:53:27] high he would Ascend above the clouds
[1:53:29] and the stars and he would sit there
[1:53:31] like
[1:53:35] God and be above the most high and he
[1:53:39] succeeded in carrying out his
[1:53:45] threats he certainly
[1:53:48] has he's had a marvelous success in
[1:53:52] carry carrying out his
[1:53:56] threats I am not giving him
[1:53:59] credit the prophet of God he has had a
[1:54:02] marvelous
[1:54:06] success so now you
[1:54:09] understand brothers that this enemy is
[1:54:14] deceitful it's not because he has
[1:54:17] power it's because he has the power to
[1:54:20] deceive
[1:54:24] amen
[1:54:28] amen now watch here somebody might be

[1:54:40] preach he we need to speak the
[1:54:44] truth and as long as it's coming out of
[1:54:47] the message we we need to hear it
[1:54:55] so brother brandom said he's got a
[1:54:56] marvelous success let's let's carry that
[1:54:58] for in our minds for just a
[1:55:03] bit by people explaining him
[1:55:09] away in every age the value of God's
[1:55:12] promised word of that
[1:55:17] age isn't that what's
[1:55:19] happening amen amen all the these men
[1:55:22] they try so hard to explain that
[1:55:25] everything brother brandom said or done
[1:55:27] was
[1:55:30] wrong they'll tell you that the cloud
[1:55:33] was not Supernatural that it was a
[1:55:38] missile and they go on and on and on and
[1:55:42] on trying to discredit the messenger or
[1:55:45] the
[1:55:47] message amen amen but remember in the
[1:55:51] face of all this
[1:55:53] there's still a
[1:55:55] third a third of Heaven that stayed true
[1:55:58] to the
[1:56:00] word I want to be part of that
[1:56:03] third I want to stand with
[1:56:06] Michael I want to stand with this
[1:56:09] Prophet amen because I was
[1:56:14] there I was
[1:56:16] there when Satan was
[1:56:19] preaching I said devil you
[1:56:25] [Music]
[1:56:26] and you know what he said you got to
[1:56:29] make your
[1:56:30] choice I made my choice a long time
[1:56:35] ago amen brothers and
[1:56:39] sisters brother let me say this I know

[1:57:04] longer amen amen
[1:57:08] Brothers as I told the church the other
[1:57:11] day I'm not worried about who's in the
[1:57:13] white church in the white
[1:57:16] house I'm worried about who's in this
[1:57:19] house
[1:57:24] is that
[1:57:25] right not worried about brothers because
[1:57:28] if he's not in this
[1:57:30] house whatever happens in the White
[1:57:32] House don't pertain to
[1:57:35] me amen but if he's in this house it
[1:57:40] don't matter who's at the White
[1:57:42] House I know that surely will be leaving
[1:57:47] [Applause]
[1:57:58] now
[1:57:59] watch so brother brandom said that he
[1:58:01] explained in every age he explained the
[1:58:03] promised word
[1:58:07] away that's exactly what he's done in
[1:58:09] every age he's explained it
[1:58:12] away you got to be very careful of what
[1:58:15] you
[1:58:16] hear amen am he'll try to explain these
[1:58:19] things away
[1:58:23] and in paragraph 66 of the same
[1:58:25] message brother brandom says he talks
[1:58:28] about I'm just going to paraphrase it
[1:58:30] right quick in the days of Noah he tried
[1:58:32] to explain that it was impossible for it
[1:58:33] to
[1:58:36] rain hey man he said they would shoot
[1:58:39] instruments up into heaven
[1:58:42] remember and brother brandom says
[1:58:44] scientifically they could prove that
[1:58:45] there was no rain up
[1:58:48] there amen amen he says and Satan
[1:58:52] succeeded in poisoning the minds of the
[1:58:58] people you hear that YouTube garbage so
[1:59:02] much that you're going to start
[1:59:03] believing
[1:59:06] it amen you know why I'm GNA tell you
[1:59:09] something I'm GNA tell you something
[1:59:12] people say well you know the Devil he's
[1:59:13] a father of Li oh
[1:59:15] yeah he don't lie to you when it's
[1:59:20] obvious he never gives you up obvious
[1:59:23] lie brother brandom said the greatest
[1:59:26] lie that was ever told had 99.9% of the
[1:59:29] truth in
[1:59:33] it it's never going to be
[1:59:35] obvious it's never going to be obvious
[1:59:38] do you know that Satan uses
[1:59:41] facts you know he uses
[1:59:43] facts Brothers he's not he listen to me
[1:59:47] I'm not giving the devil any
[1:59:49] credit and you have to understand that
[1:59:52] I'm not on his side I'm just trying to
[1:59:55] tell you what kind of enemy he
[1:59:58] is amen amen Brothers but
[2:00:02] Satan will show you the
[2:00:06] facts when Abraham was going to have a
[2:00:09] baby Abraham said Satan said you can't
[2:00:11] have no babies you're too old that's a
[2:00:15] fact you said he was lying he wasn't
[2:00:18] lying Abraham was was too old
[2:00:22] he could have told abrah go go down
[2:00:24] there get a check
[2:00:26] up and take and take your wife and see
[2:00:29] what they tell
[2:00:31] you that that's why he could stand there
[2:00:33] and
[2:00:35] boast cuz he was he those Li they were
[2:00:40] facts they were facts amen am brothers
[2:00:44] let's bring that a little bit
[2:00:47] closer the the devil will tell you are
[2:00:50] you sick you go no yeah you are you feel
[2:00:52] that
[2:00:57] pain he he's not lying to
[2:01:00] you we think that when the devil lies
[2:01:02] he's going to come over with something
[2:01:03] no no no fairy
[2:01:08] tales he'll tell you sister your husband
[2:01:11] don't love
[2:01:14] you yes he does no no no he was cheating
[2:01:18] on you no no no was that a lie no that's
[2:01:21] the truth
[2:01:25] is that right it's nothing but the
[2:01:29] facts where did you get this
[2:01:32] idea that he's the kind of liar that we
[2:01:34] always think that he is
[2:01:37] no I'm not saying he can do whatever he
[2:01:39] wants to but in the
[2:01:42] Bible that he told the
[2:01:45] people it was the
[2:01:48] truth amen amen
[2:01:52] glory to
[2:01:54] God thank you Lord those are
[2:01:57] facts amen
[2:01:59] amen he
[2:02:01] said your kids are
[2:02:04] lost oh no they're not they're lost when
[2:02:08] he comes here smell his breath he's GNA
[2:02:10] smell like cigarettes he's gonna smell
[2:02:11] like
[2:02:15] beer come on Brothers is that the
[2:02:19] truth he tells you the facts
[2:02:22] he tells you the
[2:02:24] facts amen amen but remember one
[2:02:29] thing the truth to
[2:02:32] us the truth to us is not a declaration
[2:02:36] of right and
[2:02:38] wrong the truth to us is the person of
[2:02:41] Jesus
[2:02:44] Christ amen amen and whatever he
[2:02:48] says is greater than the facts that we
[2:02:50] see
[2:02:53] amen that is why you've got to take God
[2:02:57] in his
[2:03:00] word truth to us is not what's right and
[2:03:03] what's
[2:03:05] wrong to us is a
[2:03:08] person and when that person becomes the
[2:03:12] truth and you see that the devil tells
[2:03:14] you you're
[2:03:17] sick the truth the person of Christ
[2:03:22] it supersedes your
[2:03:29] facts is that
[2:03:31] right is that right it supersedes the
[2:03:37] facts amen amen I I was given the sign
[2:03:43] the brother said halftime is that
[2:03:45] halftime
[2:03:49] brother the brother went like that I
[2:03:51] thought that was
[2:03:55] halftime no with me brother you got to
[2:03:58] go like
[2:04:04] this amen amen so when that I'm going to
[2:04:08] start closing so when that
[2:04:11] becomes when that truth
[2:04:15] becomes part of
[2:04:17] us then that truth is greater than any
[2:04:21] fact any any symptom that we
[2:04:27] see now I want to close with
[2:04:31] this I did a little
[2:04:37] study in back in the
[2:04:42] 1940s when when God made this
[2:04:47] body he made this body perfect
[2:04:55] during the
[2:04:57] fall we know that different diseases and
[2:05:01] sickness Came Upon This
[2:05:11] body and brother Bram
[2:05:14] said he
[2:05:17] says doctors cannot heal the body they
[2:05:20] just assist the body
[2:05:25] but the body is
[2:05:27] so it's a marvelous work of
[2:05:31] God that you can cut your
[2:05:34] finger and in a week or so you can't
[2:05:37] even tell there was anything
[2:05:41] there God made the body to heal
[2:05:46] itself it made the body to heal
[2:05:50] itself amen
[2:05:52] amen and not only
[2:05:54] that this body and I just got to
[2:05:57] paraphrase it because I I spent another
[2:05:58] half hour on
[2:06:01] this but this
[2:06:04] body
[2:06:06] God gave it
[2:06:08] cells and it gave the body
[2:06:12] intelligence that when a cancer comes
[2:06:15] from the
[2:06:17] outside remember that bird
[2:06:20] knocking amen
[2:06:22] amen there's a
[2:06:25] defense that fights against all those
[2:06:30] diseases amen it fights against all
[2:06:33] those
[2:06:35] diseases and not only
[2:06:38] that I was reading an
[2:06:41] article that one of the doctors
[2:06:45] said the body will actually take a
[2:06:48] picture
[2:06:51] of something that's trying to invade it
[2:06:53] if it gets
[2:06:56] in and when it gets in they all attack
[2:07:00] it to get it
[2:07:02] out to get it
[2:07:04] out amen amen but back in
[2:07:09] 1940 there was a doctor that said
[2:07:12] something strange is happening to the
[2:07:17] body and as medicine improved
[2:07:22] and there was more
[2:07:25] knowledge in
[2:07:29] 1960 the scientists and the doctors
[2:07:34] realized that there was something
[2:07:37] called an autoimmune
[2:07:41] disease that the body was actually
[2:07:45] attacking
[2:07:48] itself the body was attacking itself
[2:07:53] the good
[2:07:55] cells could not discern right from
[2:07:59] wrong and they were attacking the good
[2:08:01] cells they were attacking each
[2:08:04] other and the body now was
[2:08:08] sick how can the
[2:08:11] people how can the
[2:08:13] people ever be
[2:08:16] victorious if we're going to keep
[2:08:18] attacking ourselves in this message
[2:08:23] amen amen but the body would heal
[2:08:26] itself does not the scripture say by his
[2:08:29] stripes we were
[2:08:32] healed amen
[2:08:35] amen these signs shall follow them that
[2:08:40] believe the body should have healing in
[2:08:46] itself when somebody is
[2:08:48] sick call the Elders anoint them pray
[2:08:51] for the
[2:08:55] sick that's the way God made the
[2:08:58] body but when these autoimmune diseases
[2:09:01] came into the
[2:09:04] body and the body started attacking
[2:09:07] itself the body became
[2:09:13] weak the body became
[2:09:20] weak for the
[2:09:23] body is weak in many sleep that what PA
[2:09:28] says because we don't discern the body
[2:09:30] of the
[2:09:33] Lord the discernment is
[2:09:39] lost and the same thing that happens to
[2:09:42] the physical body happens to the
[2:09:44] spiritual body let
[2:09:51] can you imagine how awful that my body
[2:09:54] attacks
[2:09:58] itself my body can't heal
[2:10:02] itself the way God made
[2:10:05] it brothers and
[2:10:07] sisters but
[2:10:09] remember brother brandham
[2:10:11] said why is my daughter not
[2:10:15] healed there's bomb in
[2:10:18] Gilead there's a great physician here
[2:10:22] there's a guaranteed
[2:10:25] cure there's a guaranteed
[2:10:28] cure that's the Holy Ghost that's a
[2:10:31] guaranteed
[2:10:32] cure it's not just a cure it's
[2:10:37] guaranteed brothers and
[2:10:39] sisters when the enemy comes in like a
[2:10:43] flly God will live up a
[2:10:45] stand and I believe God has given us his
[2:10:49] word so that we know
[2:10:52] it's not the bird that's picking on the
[2:10:55] Apple it's the worm at the core of the
[2:11:00] Apple amen brothers and
[2:11:03] sisters amen it's just too bad that we
[2:11:06] didn't have time to finish it
