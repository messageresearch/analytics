into the country of Moab and continued there let us pray to God father Heavenly Father glorios we're here in this glorious morning happy for another day of life contentos happy because this morning we feel such a beautiful spirit this morning and it's the worship and the praise that your children they bring this morning thank you for everything help us when we leave these doors we leave better than what we the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated Brothers thank you those musicians [Music] may God bless us this morning I just wanted to comment that last night the Lord allowed us to go into Mesa to visit the Brethren companies and they have fellowship with the brothers and we saw a very beautiful service and the way that the Lord was moving last night I was saying do you remember in 1979 1980s 79 80 81. there are brothers here that were there and I'm referring to 20th and Fillmore [Music] we had services that the people the neighbors they would come and ask well what's going on over there we hear Thunders we see like smoke coming out they're on 20th and Fillmore Garcia they're the one they're preaching to us as a brother Bernie Garcia Hermanos [Music] we had some marvelous Services Brothers we had just a Revival the commentary I was commenting to our brother Marcos back there my brother Johnny Alvarado [Music] Indiana God bless our brothers we know that he's in a super good place but it was a pleasure to see our brother Johnny Alvarado dancing and running he'd get up and he'd start to worship God Hermanos Hermanos brothers and sisters brothers it was just something so beautiful the Lord will visit us in such a wonderful way my mind takes me to a service there in Bayer New Mexico our brother Nick Castillo was still alive he was the pastor and I used to live there in Bayer New Mexico I would congregate there with them and one day we had a service brother a super wonderful Circle worship songs and praise began some of us started to shout out and then suddenly you hear and I myself personally heard a wonderful beautiful I haven't heard such beautiful music like the one I was hearing that day and many times you say I heard because not everyone else hears but I was listening to a very wonderful music when service is over we all went to eat somewhere and I went on to sister Lily Nicolas the wife of our brother Nick is and I extend my hand I said sister I just want to congratulate you is [Music] the music you were playing it was touching my heart all I could do was feel the presence of the Lord and she says brother Juanito I too was also here but I had my hands raised she wasn't playing the piano she had her hands raised my question is who was playing the piano many times we're going to here and we're going to feel and we're going to listen and I repeat again maybe not all hear it when the voice in the river Cameo brothers and suddenly they say You Heard a Voice see right is that so just as John the Baptist and what a thing baptizing in the Ohio River Los camos those that have gone there the Brethren have taken you there to the place more or less where they know that he was baptizing there's no doubt because you look up and somewhere they heard a voice this is John the Baptist was sent to forward my first coming your message heard it but not everyone heard it Brothers God knows what he's doing we thank God for that precious presence that the Sons and Daughters of God can feel this morning Brothers my message is titled decision I've been getting three messages and of the three I'm going to decide on one asking God for the leadership I cannot preach all three but God help me Lead Me Guide Me Lord and last Sunday after hearing all of you especially the brothers that came up here Brothers go back to listening to last Sunday's message many times a little detail goes over our head when we're here and I see everyone here but I don't know who's out in the Mexico City he was out in San Luis who's out in Nogales who's out in their kitchen right now I just hope that everyone's here this morning but forget about everything this morning let's put our concentration here this morning we want to live better than what we came isn't that everyone's desire Brothers to leave here better than what we came why not say it that way and with your health we will accomplish it says but I was admired by the brothers the brothers Octavio felt to put up here God blessed everyone did an exceptional job just just to show you Brothers I don't know if it went over your head or you caught it like I'm seeing my brother this morning in one of the and one of the first services that they had here [Music] Allegre happy and so joyful because finally they were already now in the church and we had a pastor immense and he mentioned his name brother Johnny Alvarado muchos may God grant us many services many many days but God has something here from all of us God had hid it from all of us that he was planning on picking up in his place our brother Johnny can anyone tell me this morning I knew it Brothers I don't believe it and this morning we want to thank God before he took up our pastor he put in the heart of these young people these young preachers we have here Brothers I remember I came in from that door one day I got here a little early was speaking with our brother Johnny Alvarado I arrive and I interrupt them and I greet them then I told Brother Johnny this young man I can see something tremendous in this man he's going to be of a lot of help for us and now he's the co-pastor of ours and back then we didn't know it Brothers we didn't know it is everyone had their place and we had the pastor contentos alegres we're happy and so joyful and I think I told you if he keeps smiling at me like that I'm going to keep coming and brothers I'm here I am there's sometimes we run to a dog to leave but it's going to come back again so yeah that's all did you know that regreso it comes back again we've got these three cats at home they leave but they come right back right they come right back so may God help us it was the first time I heard him preach I knew him as a little boy I knew his mother before he married his father [Music] [Music] hopefully we don't get a a ticket by the police quickly to be with you all at McDowell yes and I heard a brother Eli Castillo may God bless us this morning I want to read verse 14 and verse 15. a vamosa we're going to read There is and they lifted up their voice and wept again verse 14 and they lifted up their voice again and wept again and orpah kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth claved unto her hijo in my medical um and she said behold thy sister-in-law has gone back unto her people and unto her Gods returned down after thy sister-in-law respond your root foreign [Music] Hermanos Ruth said intrigue me not to leave and that's the decision Brothers is it or is it not so number Gloria does his name be the glory number and Roots it and treat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for wither is thou goest I will go and where thou largest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God brothers that's a decision there's many things I want to say but if I can't say what I need to and the quotes that I want to read The Sixth Sense Revelation Revelations if there's something we need to ask today it's a revelation but in reading the scriptures give it to you amen yes without dice I will die and there will I be buried the Lord do so unto me and unto me and for me brothers that's a decision naomir got into a Strange Land is foreign and remember one thing brother Brandon would say God can't bless his people meanwhile they're far from their land the reason why Naomi is two sons they left there was because the Hunger Games and they heard that in the land of Moab there was food he said foreign [Music] I don't know how many brothers and sisters that happens to you know cuantas is I don't know how many are alone today presently let me tell you even if you're alone you're not alone if you're alone you live alone don't worry there's someone watching there's someone who will be with you every time there's service you're here to his name be the glory Brothers it was your decision it has us all here this morning blessed be the name of the Lord those that have helped in construction even when they're at a meeting one of them that's what I like about this place that's what I like about brothers when he gives us the opportunity to speak if we're six they're at the table he gives the opportunity to all six to give our opinion and I'm thankful for that Brothers he doesn't make the decision all alone he gives the opportunity to give your opinion now there will be times where he's going to take the initiative there are times he's going to gather us and say Brothers we yeah [Music] well it sounded and I say unto our ears or maybe that's how I heard it we don't want to know who was it that was not in agreement but we see today that it was God's will respect and the other five respected that decision that's how it should be brothers that's why we're all here this morning in this place there was no money there was nothing that takes me into one of the messages of our brother Brandon it was like a lake there the desire of everyone was to build a place where they can worship and praise the Lord if we pass around the offering place if they'd raise 80 cents Brothers 80 cents that's how he says it 80 cents Brothers back then in the 30s Brothers if they would put 80 cents in the offering bin that was a lot can you imagine now you hear music looking for a place in a church to rent surely because we can't afford to buy but behind all of that is there was God the thing that surprises me most Brothers it's already paid so his name be the glory you know one thing I think God because of the pandemic because before we would lift up the offering bin right we pass around the offering Ben do you remember we did it here but then that sickness came and we place the boxes there in the front and I thank God for that this morning if you don't want to give anything you don't have to give anything but if you're a son and daughter of God and you know that you've been called if you say is every time you come to church you'll take your offering we don't know how much you put in there we don't have to sell little Mexican Goods I've got a son his name is Jonathan you know him he went to somewhere over here around this place and when service was over yeah someone invited him so he went service was over and they announced that they had food and all these things and my son Jonathan well you know it's like a fellowship he started to order and ask in order and then he got to a place where they asked him for the money and he was left kind of shocked like well don't they just give it to you Hermanos contenders aren't we happy that we haven't sold food here yes you know what I mean right Brothers we don't have to sell anything that was the vision of our brother Johnny Alvarado vision of our brothers and that should also be our vision nothing be sold here at church if God called us then he'll provide when God sends us to preach somewhere God gives us the finances to go there his name be the glory if there's someone happy it's me because oh how I sold grapefruits and oranges I used to do car washes I had a car wash on Seventh and another on Central and all the young people washing cars and all of them washing cars and packaging up uh grapefruits I had used there and there at the stop lights selling grapefruits for a dollar for a pack of grapefruits hermanosis and if there's someone that's happy that that doesn't exist it's me first of all we don't even have grapefruit trees car washes and we don't need any car washes yes God is the one Supply in everything to his name be the glory one dear brother Sosa who came up front he gave us the report he delivered and a brother Guzman Hermanos Brothers I'm so happy I'm very happy when I noticed that there were two or three brothers that put their credit how bold I take my hat off and I love you Brothers thank you for that decision if I would have been amongst you I would have done the same because I love God's work Gloria to his name be the glory amen Hermanos amen brothers and those is so we've got Ruth the name is the two sons there was something out there in her land she decided to come back they're both daughter-in-laws and the moment came where Naomi had to speak with them and told them I came full but I go empty go home or for Kester and left and noimi told root she left you can also go whereas but we hear that decision brother don't ask me for that decision don't beg me to leave Gloria says name be the glory your people shall be my people your God shall be my God wherever you go I will go solamente la muerte just death will make a separation between both of them and he let her go to his name be the glory I've got a quote brothers let's see if I can read it it's a redeemer Redemption Redeemer Redemption a is preaching Redeemer redemptions preached in 1955 November 19th preventor redensions Redeemer Redemption is the title of the message and I'll be in paragraph 42. our Brethren can find it otherwise we'll just read it paragraph 42. This is a type of the Bride when her mother-in-law said now Ruth would you return back she said as the Lord said I will not leave with you I'll go with you Gloria does the name be the glory amen amen making her choice that's the title of our message this is Young decision and in parentheses I put your decision it's your decision what are you going to do that's your decision if you're a young person you plan on getting married your decision to get married it's his name be the glory if it's a young lady she has all the right God gives her all the right to say yes no or to say no yes I see is that so Americans if the young man goes and then gets uh bold enough and I struggle to get uh courageous first of all I don't even speak English she didn't speak Spanish I don't even know how I did it I don't know if it was English Spanish or something mixed but my wife is here foreign in elementary the government pays for everything for my little lunch they would pay for it a little piece of bread cut down the middle with a little butter and a little carton of chocolate milk or regular milk they would give it to us the government would pay for that but once I finish that yeah I couldn't continue we were a low-income people I wanted to study I really enjoyed studying especially history fascinates me Las mathematicas no math that was not my strong suit one day they put me there on the board in second grade they're on the board and the super and chose me imagine I didn't know I never paid attention to that is and they made me do this small little like little equation division put 34 right here and then do this and then put 10 580. that's yours now divided I'm there on the board and finally he said you know what just go ahead and sit down oh it's the glory to God can you please stay behind I've got to go swim I gotta go play soccer no you're going to stay Hermanos Los primeros numeros Brothers he taught me the first numbers to enter into mathematics and I liked I fell in love why because someone taught me Hermanos amen brothers so then we learned we learn glory to God I don't know how many are learning but I'm learning let's continue on there's where every man has to come in his life you have to decide whether you're going to have an education or not you have to make a choice who's going to be your wife I was reading a message and brother Brian says the only man the only man that did not choose and the young people preached many a lot here the only man that did not choose was Adam are we in agreement that's the only one that did not choose Brothers we chose Nosotros we chose because it's a decision Adam didn't have it he woke up and There Was His companion let's keep reading there had to be decisions choices made in life yes and this may be the night that you'll have your final call to make your choice whom you're going to serve maybe your final time laying here Dad on the stretcher usted Madre you mother over there young lady it may be your final time to make your choice I wish I had time to dig into those old nuggets is we'll just have to hit the highlights his name be the glory notice Roots was willing to forsake her Idols forsake her past if you really born again in your heart he said okay notice what he's saying if you're really born again in your heart I don't get how rough the roads get usted you'll still hold on to God's unchanging hands and holding on to God's unchanging hands no matter what's laying before me Jesus if Jesus goes with me I'll go hallelujah hallelujah long as he goes that's all that's necessary and she returned and all the picture now the Gentiles just coming in Naomi the Jewish church and notice when they turn he said got back to the Homeland yeah they came in just barely just in the barley season in this life we all have to make a decision talking about the young man and the young ladies talking about education in this is to make a decision in another message when you're looking for a place where to congregate and you're looking for a place where to take your family they say yo notes I wouldn't rest until I find one that preaches the entire plan of God and I believe that this morning if I was looking for one yeah I don't have to search anymore I found it this is my last stop did you hear me esposa is I told my wife this is our last stop we're going to stay here they kick me out well I'll come right back and that's where we fail because we still don't have it estamos we're walking towards it every day we're making an efforts I make them I'm human but we want to find that estamos we're walking we want to live better than yesterday all of our decisions amen amen it's not a key we can't be here be there we want to be in one place don't rest pray to God ask us amen Brothers but I see it to his name is when we go out into the missionary field we always are careful that everything be good be right so his name is today we came and I want to go park where there's no dirty where there's asphalt is where this morning I was surprised where's the dirt at Pakistan no one else that seat where you're at Brothers no one else can occupy and I'm not referring to this is my special

haven't been called and you know what happens to those that go to season without being called it's death just like the president of the United States is taking care of today I don't know how many saw the president of the United States when he went to Mexico City I don't know how many saw it or not but he was there and then the prime minister of Canada was there and the cars that escort him to their identical which one is we're standing there waving and once the president came to Denver Colorado we're working there in the streets and then certainly men with ties and Dark Shades get out of here get out get out get out who are these guys it was the Secret Service foreign [Music] they take turns but never leave it those are security guards Hermanos Hermanas brothers and sisters without being called no one could see the king but Esther said fast for three days I'm gonna go see the king and if I perish what did she say let me perish is that what she said God bless the decisions if I perish I perish yes this morning she went out and saw the king he said yes and if the king wouldn't extend his staff then it was death there was someone that can go to her but when the king saw her he extended his scepter and she came to him so his name be the glory may God help us may God bless us my decision is to be in a church where all the Council of the word is preached I've made the decision
