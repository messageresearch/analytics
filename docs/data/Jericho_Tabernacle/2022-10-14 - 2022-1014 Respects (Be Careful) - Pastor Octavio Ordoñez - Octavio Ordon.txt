amen amen so 105. 105 1 through 15. oh give thanks unto the Lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the People Sing unto him sing songs unto him salmos turkey of all his wondrous works glory in His holy name let the heart of them Rejoice that seek the Lord glorious seek the Lord and his strength seek his face ever more remember His Marvelous works that he has done his wondrous and the judgments of his mouth according his servant he's children of Jacob his chosen he is the Lord Our God his judgments are in all the Earth yes he had remembered his Covenant forever the word which he commanded to a thousand Generations which Covenant he made with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac [Music] and confirm the safe same unto Jacob for the law for a law and to Israel for an Everlasting Covenant saying unto thee will I give the land of Canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few men in number yeah very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one Kingdom to another Pueblo and he suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he reproved Kings for their sake church not mine anointed yes sir and do my prophets no harm not okay amen you may be seated here's a message that brother Brian spoke about is called respects yes the subtitle is be careful so I'm just going to read from Brother Branham um and uh it would be nice if you could go home and read or hear the message I don't want to take too much time but I want to bring a point I like for everyone to everyone to check up in their hearts and find out yes how you stand before God having a hard time you guys uh pray for me okay all right we'll go home early okay I'm just gonna re try and keep calm um uh I think the brothers have the message I'm going to start with line 45 or paragraph 45. I want to take a subject from there of respects really near David crying out to the Lord respects is what we owe to God El respect is and that's one thing that I would like yes to drill this to the heart of every person here tonight that in all things that we see going on we must give respects to it is when they were very few men in Israel perhaps Abraham Isaac and Jacob Who had who he was speaking of very few men and that he rebuke Nations and kingdoms for them is God rebuked the Nations and Kings saying touch now my anointed and do my prophets no harm is prophetas over an eggless this eclassistus Ecclesiastes the 12th chapter 13 verses let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the full duty of the hand is the conclusion of the whole manner is to fear God and when you cannot have respects until you have fear equal you've got to have fear of God also in the Proverbs that Proverbs 9 10. the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom the fear of God now that don't mean that you're afraid of him but that means that you are giving him respects and reverence and when you respect God you fear God you fear that you might displease him in some way you Fearless you would do something wrong you won't want to um says I fear my mother I fear my wife I fear my church I fear all of God's servants but it's all unless I should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way this is I fear the people I feel the people of the city unless I should do something wrong that would cause them to think that I wasn't a Christian it is see you've got before you can have respects you've got to have fear and God demands God demands it he demands respects he demands and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respect is now you talk for instance the man he's a farmer or maybe he's a shop worker and nobody pays attention to him [Music] but let him get the job and the policemen and come down the street and a policeman with this badge and uniform on police well maybe someone wouldn't speak of him the day before hello there's John how are you see why is it it's kind of an awe or a fear or a respect because of it is of the city or maybe uh who would President Kenny Kennedy tonight be if he wasn't a President Kennedy Kansas but it was just the man he is but yet he was a worker at the that worked at a Colgate down here for forty dollars a week see he wouldn't come through the city here and nobody would pay much attention to him only his own Associates but being he's the president of the United States he deserves a respect president and uh and because that God is God he deserves respect that's right and and he we've got to respect him and give appear to him and that brings respect yes God has demanded that for himself and for all his servants I want to make sure you heard that God has demanded that for himself and for all his servants God demands respect for his servants he his servants how we know that they are his servants because he vindicates these sermons by his word he takes these servants and makes them Servants of God and proves that they are servants by making his word word through them sermons then as you respect that servant you respect God so when I respect you and you respect me we respect each other then we're respecting God is you respect me we respect each other then we're respecting God I was good did not Jesus say in so much as you have done unto the least of these my little ones you have done it unto me Matthew 25 10 25 40. and it would be better for you that a millstone was hanged at your neck and you were drowned in the deeps of the sea Italian one of my little ones who are I say unto you behold their face their Angels always behind my father's face which is in heaven is Matthew 18 10. now we know that now we know that they are that we being children of God we are a part of God and God demands this respect is and then God shows who's his children are and shows by the Wonders and signs and that it's being done if they won't take God's prep aration of Escape then there's only one thing left last Divine judgment see there's no receiving La preparations pretty interesting message so what happened to him made fun of a servant of God they received Divine judgments Moses Moses tried to help the people when he was 40 years old they rejected him they disrespected him God sent them back he turned to my room but they disrespected him after all the things he did in Egypt at the sea at the Red Sea this place then we're asking for food then they're asking for water but that's not the worst of it his own brother his own sister hermana made fun of them his own brother his own sister they disrespected his wife and they had to plea to Moses and Moses had to go and pray for for deliverance line 71 but I want to bring another thing and Vindicated by science that he was a messenger sent from God then it's up to you then it's up to them to obey this messenger uh exactly they must obey the messenger and have respects to that messenger is look at Joshua and Caleb they stayed right by his side yes sir whatever Moses was in they was in it too whether Moses was right or wrong they stayed right with him anyhow see because they know that God was God's they know that he was God's messenger foreign [Music] [Music] or whatever call it let the world do whatever they want but you give respects and when they come before God that's a Miriam videos the world God said don't you fear God to the high priest and Miriam the prophetesses said if there be any A man among you because spiritual or a prophet I the Lord or make myself known to him I speak to him in visions and reveal myself in dreams to him and so forth if he's spiritual or a prophet numbers 12 6 is my servant Moses I speak to him live two years numbers so don't you fear God in other words you talk about Moses they're talking about me if you can't respect Moses you don't respect me I haven't I've proven prove among you that my servant Moses and you have no reverence for him at all but that would be a lesson for the people of this day no respect no honors 79. no he said and because you don't do that that's the reason you got leprosy is that's the reason these things has went it's a lot because you ought to have known that this was my servant you don't know it so when you say something against him you're saying something against me so Moses praying for her life to be spared and God did spare her life and if that was the attitude of God in that day and God can't change God wants us to respect what he is doing is that you either respect that or something else is going to happen you know there was a woman that made fun of brother Bradham uh you remember she said I won't let a pet cow have the religion that William branham's got yes says that next day she died you've got to respect God you've got to do you you've got to do you you God demands respect and he demands it is Aaron to know better and knowing this that Moses was led by the spirit of God to do what he was doing yes there's a lot of examples that brother Brian talks about yeah making fun of Elijah disrespected Elijah and then the children that disrespected Elijah okay and about where Ahab caused the death of a first king 21. [Music] and they did it because they respected God's messenger is or suffer the consequences it's either receive it or go into judgment either one you want and remember another time there was some irreverent children they have been raised up in a home where did the children learn to be Reverend is and you have the shermanite woman she respected the prophet ASC respect and God honored that respect [Music] Mary the sister of Lazarus she respected the Lord Jesus Christ she got her brother back would you please stand a brother told me this this tax of brother Branham once um and I thought it was pretty good but I mean line 165. if you can't respect the man respect yeah the office he holds it is that's exactly right see respect him now in closing I really chopped up this message that we need to respect each other inspect the people out there too we'll be in good hands that we respect the people and then we respect each other they don't respect us respect them anyways please bow your hands foreign Lord I pray Lord that this chopped up message Lord that the brothers sisters can go back and listen to this message talked a lot about respect are the Servants of God are not respected but then they had to pay for that so we respect each other Lord we walk humbly before the people asking for no special privilege we just want to love you Lord we're going to walk in the world it may be hard but we're we're looking at the end at the end of the road that's what we're keeping our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ problems but we trust in you Lord you are with us you'll take care of us because we're with you Lord and we will rely on your word and that we're doing things right we're doing things with Clean Hands where no one can point a finger we're just trying to walk in the love of the Lord help us to do that help us to dedicate Our Lives once more to you Lord time is short we don't know how much time we have left Lord we want to be ready but tomorrow [Music] we're a few years down the road whenever our last day on Earth is whenever that last day on Earth is for us we want to say that we did the best we can okay thank you Lord name O Lord Jesus Christ who we sing only believe [Music] oh [Music] only me oh [Music] baby [Music] all things are possible only living oh only believe oh baby [Music] dark possible Maybe you know [Music] they are possible [Music] amen let's get to sing a song Amen only believe amen thank you to come up here bring the word to us let's go ahead and uh keep on worshiping the Lord now you may be seated [Music] [Music] I need thank you someone to wash Myself Away [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] here today [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay one day is coming back for me [Music] [Music] that day [Music] the brand new songs all day long life [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] all right [Music] [Music] get inside [Music] give me five hours [Music] but only my day foreign [Music] Center [Music] a Temptation here is nearly and ten days [Music] [Music] day today [Music] [Music] [Music] Center of me [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] anything [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] outside is this is [Music] [Music] long time [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] this Sunday after the morning service we will be having a meeting for all those attending the Nebraska trip services uh our another announcement yeah this Sunday evening at 6 p.m we will have a ministerial meeting with all the elders ministers deacons ushers song leaders and all those who participate in the service is and we have a Thanksgiving but the RS is Sister Sarah Guzman are thanking the lord for their 27th wedding anniversary [Applause] we have a petition petition brother Phil Chavez is asking prayer for sorry forgive me for Lorraine the Chavez to be held of memory loss hearing loss and all health problems to be restored also for all her possessions and finances to be restored o Phil Chavez um can you please stand with me let's go ahead and uh pray to end the service and to pray for this petition petition [Music] don't have any father celestial Lord we want to thank you for the service you have provided for us once more foreign immense healing senor or ask you in your precious Time Lord you come down from from your throne Lord and may you provide that healing Lord may you answer this petition Lord and Lord father and I ask you to keep us all safe as we walk out through those doors may keep us safe and and may you bring us here together once more because together to worship your name to hear your to hear your precious word it has all these things in the precious name and Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you're the Smiths you may be seated [Music] [Music] [Music] I'll find a way [Music] [Music] when Lost Child [Music] [Music] um oh [Music] I [Music] am just wearing days foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]
