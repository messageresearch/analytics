[1:16:03] if you would like to turn with me to
[1:16:06] second corinthians 3.
[1:16:13] i was going to read
[1:16:14] 18 but we'll start at
[1:16:17] verse 13.
[1:16:33] and not as moses which put a veil over
[1:16:36] his face that the children of israel
[1:16:38] could not steadflessly look
[1:16:40] the end of that which was a is abolished
[1:16:53] but their minds were blinded
[1:16:55] for until this day remaineth
[1:16:58] the same veil untaken away in the
[1:17:01] reading of the old testament which veil
[1:17:04] is done away in christ
[1:17:28] when moses came back from the mountain
[1:17:33] and when he came back from the mountain
[1:17:35] after speaking to god and seen his glory
[1:17:38] del monte
[1:17:41] gloria after he received this the ten
[1:17:43] commandments the second time
[1:17:49] he came back from the mountain
[1:17:52] and being in god's glory
[1:17:56] what was that song the glory is in the
[1:17:59] house of the lord today
[1:18:04] after being in his glory
[1:18:06] gloria he walked down el bajo and that
[1:18:09] same glory that was that he saw in the
[1:18:12] image of god
[1:18:14] gloria
[1:18:16] was now reflected in him
[1:18:20] and as he was going down the children of
[1:18:22] israel saw that glory
[1:18:27] and it was too great for them to where
[1:18:29] he had to pull put a veil over his face
[1:18:35] because they could not see that great
[1:18:37] glory
[1:18:38] he is
[1:18:54] and there's a veil over those scriptures
[1:19:00] and to this day there's people that
[1:19:02] cannot see that glory
[1:19:08] because the veil is over the face
[1:19:12] amen and uh
[1:19:14] where was i at
[1:19:17] 15 it says
[1:19:19] but even unto this day when moses is
[1:19:21] read the veil is upon their heart
[1:19:30] nevertheless when it shall be turned to
[1:19:34] the lord the veil shall be taken away
[1:19:41] now the lord is that spirit where the
[1:19:45] spirit of the lord is there is liberty
[1:19:48] porque el senor
[1:19:54] amen now listen to this
[1:19:56] but we all with open face beholding
[1:20:00] now open face means the unveil is took
[1:20:03] it off the veil is took off
[1:20:12] we with all open face as in a glass the
[1:20:15] glor behold the glory of
[1:20:18] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[1:20:21] lord
[1:20:22] are changed into the same image
[1:20:26] from glory unto glory even as by the
[1:20:29] spirit of the lord

[1:20:58] words lord we thank you that you have
[1:21:01] allowed us to be here in in your
[1:21:03] presence
[1:21:07] that we could worship you with songs and
[1:21:09] in spirit and in truth
[1:21:15] lord we sincerely just submit ourselves
[1:21:17] unto thee this morning
[1:21:22] lord that you may express just a little
[1:21:24] thought on your glory and your image
[1:21:32] lord we thank you we
[1:21:34] submit all of ourselves each and every
[1:21:36] person in this building
[1:21:38] is
[1:21:46] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:21:49] amen and amen amen amen you may be
[1:21:51] seated
[1:21:54] amen my uh title this morning
[1:21:59] is god's glory in full view is la la
[1:22:02] gloria de dios
[1:22:04] i i don't think anything is in
[1:22:06] coincidence
[1:22:12] and i just thank god that as walking up
[1:22:15] here they were singing that beautiful
[1:22:17] song
[1:22:28] amen
[1:22:29] when we i would like to just talk about
[1:22:31] the glory of god just for a few seconds
[1:22:36] just so that we can understand what the
[1:22:38] glory of the lord is
[1:22:42] whenever we worship the lord
[1:22:46] whenever uh somebody is preaching
[1:22:50] when the spirit of the lord uh
[1:22:52] it just so anointed the believer
[1:22:59] we can't help but to give god glory
[1:23:03] to
[1:23:04] glory we can't help but to praise the
[1:23:06] lord
[1:23:10] because of all the goodness that he's
[1:23:11] done for us
[1:23:14] we can't help to say glory hallelujah
[1:23:18] gloria i remember when brother branham
[1:23:21] spoke spanish just for a little bit
[1:23:26] espanol it was how he would hear the
[1:23:29] mexican people
[1:23:32] say gloria dios
[1:23:34] uh glory to god gloria dios glory to god
[1:23:37] how they would give him glory
[1:23:41] and that's what he remembered of the
[1:23:43] worship that the people would give him
[1:23:49] when he would give they would give god
[1:23:51] all the glory and the honor
[1:23:53] gloria
[1:23:55] but but the glory that we see here in
[1:23:57] the scriptures
[1:24:08] the glory of god it is that which
[1:24:11] expresses his nature la gloria
[1:24:16] whenever you see something that is just
[1:24:18] amazing
[1:24:22] and you see it visually you say
[1:24:25] people you hear people say wow that's
[1:24:28] glorious
[1:24:37] and they see it and they say look it at
[1:24:39] the glory of that city it is an event
[1:24:41] it's a meeting la gloria
[1:24:55] the glory of god
[1:25:11] he said i will come down in my glory
[1:25:14] el dijo de sendai gloria and the bible
[1:25:16] says that his glory set down on the
[1:25:19] mountain
[1:25:22] and what did they saw
[1:25:32] [Applause]
[1:25:37] that was an expression of who god is
[1:25:42] is god's glory
[1:25:45] so when god's glory fills this place
[1:25:51] it's not just a floating spirit
[1:26:07] esposo every time a king would go out to
[1:26:10] meet the people
[1:26:14] his glory was his crown so gloria
[1:26:18] so what he would do is he would put that
[1:26:20] glory on his head
[1:26:24] gloria
[1:26:25] to show how great he was
[1:26:29] so how majestic the man was
[1:26:34] and the bible says that though a woman
[1:26:36] is a jewel on a man's crown
[1:26:41] a good woman
[1:26:43] is a jewel in a man's crown yes
[1:26:46] she is the glory of a man
[1:27:00] now today the world is trying to find a
[1:27:03] virtuous woman the bride
[1:27:09] a virtuous church
[1:27:12] a virtuous people
[1:27:14] but they'll only be one virtuous woman
[1:27:19] and that is the bride of jesus christ
[1:27:23] who can find a virtuous woman
[1:27:27] and he begin to say what she did
[1:27:30] commence
[1:27:32] how she would wake up before everybody
[1:27:34] else
[1:27:37] how she would go to the markets and she
[1:27:39] would uh trade and sell and buy comes
[1:27:46] [Music]
[1:27:57] and he is known of all he's known by all
[1:28:01] the elders and all the people at the
[1:28:02] gates
[1:28:07] and then after that scripture
[1:28:09] it continues with the woman
[1:28:12] and it's showing inestra because of her
[1:28:15] a causalia because of her glory
[1:28:19] de la gloria he is known by all people
[1:28:24] because his house is in order
[1:28:40] and the bride today is the glory of the
[1:28:42] husband
[1:28:45] he is known by the whole world
[1:28:49] through each and every one of us
[1:28:53] how do we portray christ today
[1:28:57] when we're at work
[1:29:02] how are we portraying god
[1:29:06] because when they see me
[1:29:18] they persecute christ because of my
[1:29:21] uh hypocrisy
[1:29:28] [Music]
[1:29:33] and that's how the bride she is the
[1:29:35] glory of the husband is
[1:30:05] so that the glory of god may be here
[1:30:09] so the glory is to make himself known
[1:30:15] i remember brother branham talking about
[1:30:17] what reveal means
[1:30:29] why do we need to see the glory of the
[1:30:31] lord
[1:30:42] why do i have to see the glory of the
[1:30:44] lord
[1:30:47] what will happen to us with that
[1:30:49] manifestation
[1:30:54] that's a question that we we should ask
[1:30:56] ourselves
[1:30:58] now i'm using this word glory
[1:31:14] it's god
[1:31:26] where god made himself known
[1:31:44] why was it so important for god to make
[1:31:46] himself known to the people
[1:31:52] that's a good question
[1:31:54] that's a good question to ask ourselves
[1:32:04] the greatest minds have tried to find
[1:32:07] the secret of life
[1:32:14] albert einstein now today we have elon
[1:32:16] musk
[1:32:19] elon musk we have stephen hawkings and
[1:32:21] stephen hawking we have all these great
[1:32:24] intellectual people
[1:32:26] personas intellectuals trying to find
[1:32:28] the secret of life
[1:32:33] through scientific research
[1:32:36] through mathematics
[1:32:52] you
[1:32:52] know it's as simple as this book
[1:32:58] all the mysteries that all these people
[1:33:00] are looking for
[1:33:04] the secret to eternal life
[1:33:08] now people are there in their labs
[1:33:10] trying to find a way to live forever
[1:33:17] trying to find another place for
[1:33:19] humanity to live because
[1:33:28] trying to download our consciousness in
[1:33:30] in artificial intelligence
[1:34:05] how did everything how was everything
[1:34:07] created
[1:34:10] those are these great big questions
[1:34:12] people
[1:34:13] ask themselves
[1:34:16] questions
[1:34:57] they could never open these mysteries
[1:35:03] in this book
[1:35:05] the mystery of life
[1:35:09] amen amen
[1:35:11] what what are the mysteries
[1:35:13] mysterious
[1:35:14] what is the mystery quality
[1:35:17] for me but i mean as simple as it gets
[1:35:20] for me
[1:35:22] and i say it with all of my heart
[1:35:26] it's it's boiled down with three letters
[1:35:39] god is the mystery of all of it
[1:35:43] and god hides all the mysteries
[1:35:48] in all in god has the greatest
[1:35:50] mathematics you'll ever know
[1:35:56] there's the greatest technologies in him
[1:36:02] in him there's
[1:36:04] great dimensions in god
[1:36:06] exists
[1:36:08] is
[1:36:12] [Applause]
[1:36:25] [Applause]
[1:36:29] and it's so amazing to know that we
[1:36:32] boiled it down to god
[1:36:36] but
[1:36:48] that is here and he's over there in
[1:36:50] africa
[1:36:52] how he could allow something to live and
[1:36:54] allow something to die
[1:36:58] he allows the sun to rise up every
[1:37:00] morning
[1:37:03] he is the one that has given me grace to
[1:37:05] wake up this morning
[1:37:09] and he was the one that allowed people
[1:37:11] to pass on
[1:37:15] in him is the mystery
[1:37:21] and people try to find it
[1:37:24] and they'll never they never will
[1:37:27] they never will because it's in this
[1:37:29] simple little book
[1:37:32] in your
[1:37:44] and great men have have read this bible
[1:37:49] yet they cannot uncover the mystery
[1:37:55] amen amen
[1:37:58] he is
[1:37:59] the mystery hey listen
[1:38:01] now god
[1:38:03] he he's not like us he's not flesh like
[1:38:06] us
[1:38:09] if i could say he's not even the pillar
[1:38:12] of fire
[1:38:19] if i could say he wasn't that flesh that
[1:38:22] abraham saw in the tent
[1:38:29] the bible says in
[1:38:30] first timothy 1 17.
[1:38:35] now unto the king eternal portal
[1:38:39] immortal immortal invisible in receiving
[1:38:43] the only wise god
[1:38:45] being honor and glory forever amen
[1:38:53] he is the great invisible god
[1:39:09] because i don't believe he's just
[1:39:10] invisible like we think he is
[1:39:14] invisible
[1:39:16] he's just so great that we can't see him
[1:39:22] brother branham says in christ is the
[1:39:23] mystery of god revealed
[1:39:28] the first first thing was
[1:39:32] that god wanted to reveal himself to the
[1:39:34] people
[1:39:37] [Music]
[1:39:38] now we've got
[1:39:52] god's very desire is to reveal himself
[1:39:58] and in revealing himself
[1:40:02] that's where life comes from
[1:40:05] that's where healing comes from
[1:40:08] that's where salvation comes from
[1:40:11] when he has revealed himself to us
[1:40:16] that's where restoration comes from
[1:40:20] from the
[1:40:28] as the great jehovah who lived who
[1:40:30] covered all space time and eternity como
[1:40:33] el grand dios
[1:40:56] i want you to think of that great big
[1:40:58] devil that's been tormenting you viens
[1:41:24] the one that covers all space time and
[1:41:26] eternity
[1:41:29] he could not he's too great to ever be
[1:41:32] revealed to people
[1:41:37] because it would be too mysterious
[1:41:41] how could that great being ever that
[1:41:44] never did begin
[1:41:48] that after you went way beyond a cycle
[1:41:51] of a hundred
[1:41:52] of billions and trillions and trillions
[1:41:55] of light space commons
[1:42:11] and a great creature that was all that
[1:42:13] and still is
[1:42:17] that is our god
[1:42:20] that goes on from trillions and
[1:42:22] trillions of light years
[1:42:39] but in revealing who he is
[1:42:44] is where life is
[1:42:46] when god can reveal his image
[1:42:51] there is deliverance
[1:42:53] every time god would reveal himself to
[1:42:55] abraham or
[1:42:57] or moses
[1:43:01] he came with a message of deliverance or
[1:43:04] restoration
[1:43:09] he appeared to the children of israel
[1:43:15] the bible says it was the glory of god
[1:43:20] and and whenever the glory of god
[1:43:22] appeared
[1:43:25] they got so afraid that they said don't
[1:43:27] let god speak to us anymore
[1:43:33] he's too
[1:43:34] he he's going to cause us to die
[1:43:57] and it took a profit to hide him from
[1:44:00] the people
[1:44:05] but it takes a profit
[1:44:08] to reveal him
[1:44:11] and just whenever just like john the
[1:44:13] baptist
[1:44:16] the bible says that he was there to
[1:44:18] forerun the coming of the lord
[1:44:22] he was the one to reveal jesus christ
[1:44:28] because he was him behind the prophets
[1:44:47] but then it took a profit to stop out of
[1:44:49] the wilderness
[1:44:54] [Applause]
[1:44:56] here you could see the glory of god
[1:45:14] but it was a stupid shouldered man
[1:45:18] full of grace and full of glory de
[1:45:20] gracia gloria brother branham said one
[1:45:23] time
[1:45:25] he said man i've always i always thought
[1:45:27] god was scared of me or i mean
[1:45:43] that jesus is the very heart of god
[1:45:46] jesus
[1:45:48] so when jesus began to walk on the
[1:45:50] shores of galilee
[1:45:52] jesus
[1:45:55] it was god pouring out his heart to the
[1:45:58] people
[1:46:01] the fullness of the godhead bodily was
[1:46:03] in that man
[1:46:08] it was the glory of god
[1:46:12] and the bible says there was no beauty
[1:46:14] that we should desire of him
[1:46:19] but in him dwelt all the mysteries in
[1:46:22] him
[1:46:38] name
[1:46:41] he was the one that held everything
[1:46:46] and all the the bible says that the
[1:46:48] hills and and the the grass and
[1:46:51] everything shouted for joy when they
[1:47:03] he was the key to eternal life
[1:47:11] he was that manifestation or that glory
[1:47:14] of god
[1:47:17] but it depends
[1:47:19] depending on how you see him
[1:47:23] so there is a manifestation of god
[1:47:27] manifestation
[1:47:29] that was jesus christ
[1:47:31] but then it took part
[1:47:34] a revelation
[1:47:43] he went there and preached to the people
[1:47:47] hundreds and hundreds of people uh
[1:47:49] centenaries
[1:47:51] but it took
[1:47:52] your personal revelations
[1:47:57] of who he is
[1:48:00] god's glory can be here the glory of
[1:48:04] but the veil can still be on our faces
[1:48:09] where we cannot see the glory of god
[1:48:12] gloria and it depends on how you see him
[1:48:15] he says
[1:48:44] see we can believe in god
[1:48:47] we could actually believe in the whole
[1:48:50] bible
[1:48:53] but the key is
[1:48:55] knowing where god is at today
[1:49:01] [Applause]
[1:49:10] i could praise god because all the good
[1:49:13] um good scriptures in the bible
[1:49:18] but where is the word made alive today
[1:49:24] and that is the revelation yes
[1:49:28] to know where is god manifesting his
[1:49:30] glory at today
[1:49:35] where is the word that we're supposed to
[1:49:37] see
[1:49:44] [Applause]
[1:49:52] every single age even all the way back
[1:49:54] from adam's
[1:50:09] moses could not preach noah's message
[1:50:14] even though noah's message was to
[1:50:16] took the people out
[1:50:21] and it was the word of
[1:50:22] god but that wasn't the message of the
[1:50:26] day for moses
[1:50:31] and moses could say oh i believe i
[1:50:33] believe what noah did moses
[1:50:47] and whenever he saw the manifested word
[1:50:50] for that day
[1:50:54] then it pushed them into a restored
[1:50:56] state entonces
[1:51:00] it took them out of egypt
[1:51:02] they took them through the wilderness
[1:51:16] they caught the glory of god the image
[1:51:19] of god for their days
[1:51:22] the jews they believed all the bible
[1:51:27] they believed the law
[1:51:30] if anybody knew the law it was the high
[1:51:32] priest and and the pharisees
[1:51:38] but when that word was supposed to be
[1:51:40] fulfilled
[1:51:44] it was all fulfilled in that name man
[1:51:46] named jesus christ
[1:51:51] they rejected it
[1:51:54] they rejected that word for their hours
[1:51:59] they rejected the glory or they rejected
[1:52:02] the image
[1:52:06] and that's why
[1:52:08] that's why you could see that woman that
[1:52:11] touched the hem of his garment
[1:52:14] elbow
[1:52:27] because so many people were touching him
[1:52:29] and pulling it on him
[1:52:33] but it was the vision that she had
[1:52:38] people had the revelation of him being a
[1:52:40] good prophet
[1:53:07] but what are those mysteries how are
[1:53:09] they revealed
[1:53:28] if you could see the christ in in every
[1:53:30] step of the bible
[1:53:34] then the mysteries of god have been
[1:53:36] revealed to you
[1:53:38] so
[1:53:53] but then you go to the man that
[1:53:55] put a veil over his face
[1:54:00] and they begin to hit him
[1:54:03] they were touching the same skin
[1:54:06] they
[1:54:19] so they could disrespect it they could
[1:54:21] do whatever they wanted with it
[1:54:27] there was no life there no habia
[1:54:30] because they could not see the veil was
[1:54:32] over their faces
[1:54:49] is
[1:54:51] transformed
[1:54:52] amen amen
[1:54:54] amen it takes that
[1:54:57] you can believe in god
[1:55:00] i realize we can believe in god
[1:55:04] actually we can believe in jesus christ
[1:55:09] but the thing is we leave him there on
[1:55:10] the shores of galilee
[1:55:15] we leave them still with nail scarred
[1:55:17] hands
[1:55:20] say yes jesus you died for me
[1:55:24] but he where is he today
[1:55:29] christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:55:32] forever
[1:55:34] he's not over there anymore
[1:55:37] he's here in the people
[1:55:40] pueblo the glory of god is here like
[1:55:42] gloria
[1:55:43] where is he
[1:55:56] jesus christ
[1:56:06] the woman at the well she had such a
[1:56:08] great revelation
[1:56:12] because she wasn't even a jew
[1:56:15] and she was sitting there at the well
[1:56:20] and the first revelation she got of him
[1:56:25] was as a man
[1:56:38] i'm a samaritan and you're a jew yo soy
[1:57:34] and so he continued to
[1:57:37] reveal the word to her
[1:57:38] comments
[1:57:41] until she says
[1:57:44] she said one day they'll be one they say
[1:57:49] it'll be the christ
[1:57:52] he'll reveal all these things to us
[1:57:56] he said i am he will be called
[1:57:59] and then the revelation went greater and
[1:58:02] greater
[1:58:03] revelations
[1:58:05] and when she realized that he was the
[1:58:07] christ the son of the living god
[1:58:12] that revelation was the one that took
[1:58:14] cleaner from all of our sins
[1:58:31] what revelation do we have today
[1:58:35] where are we putting jesus christ today
[1:58:39] are we looking for him way out yonder a
[1:58:42] castle
[1:58:44] are we looking for events and times
[1:59:14] reveals all the mysteries of god
[1:59:18] and when all the mysteries of god are
[1:59:20] revealed
[1:59:24] you can lay claim on them
[1:59:27] they are yours
[1:59:42] do we
[1:59:54] do we understand when we're talking to a
[1:59:56] brother or sister
[2:00:19] because the jews missed who jesus christ
[2:00:21] was
[2:00:24] christian
[2:00:28] the rejection of the manifestation of
[2:00:31] the word
[2:00:34] but when peter saw him
[2:00:36] pedro
[2:00:37] and jesus says who do men say that i am
[2:00:40] jesus
[2:00:42] same thing with the progress of
[2:00:44] revelation
[2:00:47] men had great great thoughts of who
[2:00:49] jesus christ was
[2:01:06] there is a person on this earth
[2:01:10] that has a spirit of a prophet that has
[2:01:12] passed on
[2:01:16] that's a great revelation
[2:01:19] but it wasn't the revelation that could
[2:01:22] that revelation could not save them
[2:01:27] that revelation of thinking jesus christ
[2:01:29] was a prophet could not heal them
[2:02:14] upon that the by church is built upon
[2:02:16] that revelation
[2:02:20] of who christ is for our days
[2:02:25] amen amen
[2:02:27] brother
[2:02:28] peter he saw him pedro
[2:02:30] and he got that great revelation
[2:02:35] but
[2:02:36] they had three great revelations
[2:02:41] he saw who jesus was
[2:02:44] jesus but if if i could be
[2:02:46] bold enough
[2:02:50] to say that they didn't see the true
[2:02:53] great revelation
[2:02:58] because
[2:03:08] amen amen
[2:03:10] and we have to catch that word
[2:03:29] and whenever they
[2:03:30] caught it and accepted it
[2:03:34] just the same way the jews how they
[2:03:37] handled jesus
[2:03:41] it's the same way
[2:03:42] how we handle the word
[2:03:47] so in martin luther's time when they
[2:03:50] grasp that revelation of justification
[2:04:08] when moses saw the glory of god
[2:04:13] he came down from the mountain
[2:04:15] and that same portion of the word
[2:04:19] that was revealed to him
[2:04:22] it was shining
[2:04:37] i just i don't have no structure here
[2:04:41] but
[2:04:43] was that the full
[2:04:44] word that
[2:04:46] martin luther received
[2:04:54] it wasn't it was just a portion of that
[2:04:56] word
[2:04:59] it was just a portion because it only
[2:05:01] transformed him into a justified
[2:05:04] statement
[2:05:18] it was not the full
[2:05:20] view of god's glory
[2:05:23] gloria so it was only able to transform
[2:05:27] them just to a justified state
[2:05:31] transformation
[2:05:33] and
[2:05:34] wesley it was a greater revelation
[2:05:39] and it transformed them from
[2:05:40] justification to a sanctified statement
[2:05:46] because the glory of god opened up just
[2:05:48] a little bit more gloria
[2:05:51] the word of god
[2:05:54] do you understand
[2:05:55] so when peter saw the flesh
[2:06:01] the man
[2:06:02] of the godhead bodily in jesus christ
[2:06:08] that
[2:06:10] was only a portion
[2:06:13] god was in the fullness your system
[2:06:17] in jesus christ
[2:06:19] because the bible saw brother branham
[2:06:20] says
[2:06:22] all that was in god
[2:06:24] was poured into christ
[2:06:26] and all that was in christ
[2:06:40] amen amen so the fullness of god was
[2:06:43] there
[2:06:44] yes
[2:06:46] god's full presence was there with the
[2:06:48] bride and is here with the bride
[2:06:50] presence
[2:06:54] but he didn't reveal himself fully
[2:06:58] if he did then they would have been
[2:07:00] preaching the message that we have today
[2:07:02] at pentecost
[2:07:07] all the mysteries of god should be
[2:07:09] revealed
[2:07:23] he only revealed himself in portions
[2:07:27] through justification through
[2:07:28] sanctification through the uh pentecost
[2:07:31] justification
[2:07:34] that was all just portions of god even
[2:07:37] though his whole presence was there is
[2:07:46] the prophet had to come and preach a
[2:07:48] message called unveiling of god
[2:08:05] when you will receive that fullness of
[2:08:08] the word
[2:08:11] what transformation should take place in
[2:08:13] your life
[2:08:16] we've already passed justification
[2:08:18] sanctification and the holy ghost
[2:08:20] foreign
[2:08:27] so what should this glory that we see
[2:08:29] what should it do to us
[2:08:33] because when we see the glory gloria it
[2:08:37] transforms us to that same glory lost
[2:08:41] glory all the way to the image of christ
[2:08:45] amen amen
[2:08:47] amen god is so good
[2:08:49] bueno amen i i have just so much
[2:08:53] but uh i just don't want to uh
