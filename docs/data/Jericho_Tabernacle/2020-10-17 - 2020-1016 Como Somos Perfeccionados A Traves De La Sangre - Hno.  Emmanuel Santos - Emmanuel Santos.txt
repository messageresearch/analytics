[Music] [Music] so that which i'm going to speak of this evening and if you remember what i spoke on last time i spoke about this scripture but i only spoke of one portion now we're going to speak of the other portion you shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth of rams of lambs and of goats of bullocks all of them fatlings of bishop now if we can also turn to psalms 22. [Music] now the scriptures of ezekiel 39 17 and 18. [Music] they speak of the two testaments [Music] but they also speak about the crucifixion of our lord jesus christ now if you remember in ezekiel 39 18. it says a variety of animals that there are carneros it says that there are rams lambs goats and bullocks all invasion now i'm going to explain why there were so many animals in the crucifixion in the crucifixion of our lord jesus christ the first verse is my god my god why hast thou forsaken me verse 7 all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip and they shake their head saying he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him verse 12. many bullocks have compassed me fuertes strong bulls of basian have beset me around they gaped upon me with their mouths as raving as a raving and roaring lion you may be seated so like i said in ezekiel 39 18. in english in english or in spanish it gives a variety of animals that there are in salmon in psalms 22 those that are the bullocks those that are in basin those are the pharisees if you go into matthew 27 39 you'll see because the psalms it says strong bulls of basian have beset me round they gaped upon me with their mouths as raving and roaring lions and study the crucifixion of the lord jesus christ because the crucifixion is in matthew mark luke and john curiando verse 39 and they that passed by reviled him waging their heads and saying thou that destroys the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the and i believe in spanish it only gives a certain amount of titles of the priests that are there they say likewise also the chief priest mocking him with the scribes and elders said does is that in the crucifixion of the lord jesus christ there were many animals there were like it says in ezekiel rams lambs goats and bullocks so then the bullocks those are the pharisees that they open their mouths speaking against the lord jesus christ jesus not just jesus the lamb crucifixion that was present at the crucifixion not just that animal was present so that you at home can read it more patiently [Music] the hill of god is as the hill of basian a high hill as a hill of nation now there were two scriptures that i told you i was going to explain ezekiel 39 17 and 18. in 18 it says invasion basan esta in palestine is in palestine and thou son of man thus saith the lord god speak unto every feathered fowl and to every beast of the field assemble yourselves and come gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that i do sacrifice for you even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of israel that ye may eat flesh and drink blood so then in 18 crucifixion there and crows so it wasn't just jesus that was the only animal present at the crucifixion there was a variety of animals present at the crucifixion aura now season 18 that basin and this is an israel and in 17 it says in israel israel israel palestine and palestine they're this close there's a conflict to be the capital city of their state israeli palestina so israel and palestine their states jerusalem jerusalem now the mount in which jesus was crucified was on the outskirts of jerusalem it wasn't in jerusalem it was outside of jerusalem but first of all i want to show you that scripture psalms chapter 74 for god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth just israel so then israel is the god's central point for the earth and you should search for what brother branham says palestine in regards to israel and palestine because these are very significant places for us now and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull so then the mountain in which jesus died was on the outskirts of jerusalem and it was called golgotha jesus it means a place of great suffering and the grave said i'll mold you i know i'm laying here in this roman dungeon bound in chains my wrists and hands and i've got 39 stripes across my back i'm here with tears that are scalding my eyes until i can't see no more nope i can't see with my natural eye but can see a crown of righteousness laid up yonders my ankles are worn out i fell off so much from the old molded bread they throat in here foreign and the rats has run over me and the spiders in things [Music] but he could stand in the face of death and say donde grave don esta victoria where is your victory jesus crucification the reason why jesus was crucified so that you don't be crucified and jesus now i'm going to explain how jesus was taken unto the outskirts leviticus how many believe that jesus was a lamb that was sacrificed leviticus and the bullock for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy place shall one carry forth without the camp and they shall burn in the fire their skins and their flesh and their dung jerusalem jerusalem was the camp the sacrifice was taken was because the birth of jesus is an exemplary birth jesus the way that jesus was born is the way that every one of you must be born now the reason in which he came la manera que el vino the the way he came is as emmanuel emmanuel nosotros emmanuel is god with us but he doesn't want to be emanuel as your god that's the you'll have christ with you juan says now john 6 53 jesus christ then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you do you remember the last time i spoke to you all about the scripture in matthew como esque el dijo que les yo how it is that he gave him gave you bread and told them to eat les dior vino he gave them wine and he told them to drink now this bottle it was filled all the way up to here i just drank a little agua so then this water that was here it disappeared so then where's the water where is it it's in me correct jesus jesus because the blood of jesus i can't get into it but there's so many benefits receiving the blood of jesus so then you for now but there's so many benefits of jesus in drinking the blood of jesus it says except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood if you don't drink that blood you have no life in you that's why it's so important you've said accepted for you to accept el sacrificio de jesus the sacrifice of jesus the shed blood because that blood if you accept it you drink it and jesus is born in you [Music] i pray now if there be one here tonight who has never yet drank the real blood of the covenant in mateo donda in matthew where i've only explained to you because it says testament but i'd like to explain to you because it's also a covenant because the covenant we received it is and renew it until she was rejuvenated after then she could give a birth [Music] doesn't yet know what it means not yet drink the real blood of the covenant that doesn't know what it means to be born again if you drink that speaks to the same thing we're talking on today but the man as soon as the lamb finally died with the blood of the lamb upon his hands he walked from the building with the same desire in his heart so then in the old testament when they sacrificed the animals physically that life of those animals it wasn't enough to eliminate that sin and since it didn't eliminate that sins even though they were performing the sacrifices it's inferior to our human blood that's why i said jesus como sacrificio that jesus has the sacrifice but him also being human is the only human being perfect with perfect blood navi no one here perfect that they've got perfect blood solo jesus only jesus the only human being because [Music] the lasagna accept the blood for the the life that was in the blood was in uh in the lamb was in the blood therefore when it's little corp corp corpsicles were broken or those blood cells were broken when it came out of the animals it couldn't go back into the human being because an animal is inferior to human being only that blood of theirs like i told you it would only postpone judgment it wouldn't take away sin it wouldn't take away condemnation by being born in the wrong manner everyone here was that was born the perfect way for for that holy now leviticus 17 11. for the life of the flesh is in the blood there's life in the blood and the blood was used to make an atonement upon the altar of our souls so one day and i have given it unto you unto the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul now i'd like to explain to you all what it is that the blood does beneficial that it benefits us so much because like i've said the blood it has so many benefits in the blood are something called red blood cells red blood cells transport oxygen they transport oxygen throughout the entire body transport they carry oxygen through your body and and to your lungs obviously if someone cuts off for respiration there's life in your blood the blood of jesus it's just the beginning um one day this blood that we carry the jesus the blood of jesus the perfect body it carries oxygen it is the one that pumps to the heart and blood gets rid of the las toxinas of those toxins of that trash that's in your body [Music] but it also takes away the sin which is death do you see the benefits of the blood that's why you see you need to drink of that blood because the blood el dijo sangri he said blood no agua he but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding second english this is inspiration and i know that in english he uses the word inspiration but for both of us to understand both languages inspiration in both english and in spanish it's a very elevated word to you to say breathe [Music] but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration or the breath of the almighty give it the understanding the best the best way to receive the understanding of this bible through the blood of jesus you've got to be born of the blood for the blood is the best way to receive revelation of the bible is to be born that gives you the understanding of the bible now job 33 4. the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almighty hath given me life [Music] jesus so you see if you receive the blood of jesus it gives you a breath air oxygen it gives you understanding [Music] it takes away all of that sin that's in you that's why this blood of jesus it's the only perfect blood because one thing that god is is perfection he is perfection if you accept the blood that jesus gave it's a sign like histamine jesus that blood that was in jesus christ you will receive perfection in you and in that way it gives you the inspiration [Music] he never manufactured but he created a chemical in the blood of jesus christ just like you in susan you have a chemical in your blood that gets rid of the toxins so the blood [Music] el pecados introduco when sin was introduced in the human race we had fellowship with god but when sin was introduced there was a social distancing branham brother branham says you don't even bridge that chasm it takes with god [Music] you is the pandemia now this pandemic affected much has affected many espiritu spiritually but you all should take advantage of that social distance with the world but so you can have a social drawing close to god just i forget where brother branham says it but a tragedy took place in the world or with the israelites something that unto our eyes it looked like a tragedy but a decent amount of branham but brother branham says because if we take advantage of time correctly it will take away the social distance we had with god and it will draw us closer to have a social closening it's been god's tender hand says when you confess sin and god doesn't even know that you sinned at any point in your life yes that's right he said he lost put them in the sea of forgetfulness just like you enzo sangre in your blood you have a chemical that gets rid of the toxins that as soon as the ink falls into and it's destroyed at that moment it's a chemical that that bleach that clarks that chemical is it is their forgiveness it's in the blood of jesus [Music] one of the things that he knows how to imitate is your voice it seems like it's you talking to yourself what is and in the message and your sins are dropped into the bleach of the blood of the son of god it remits sin so much that it's put in the sea of god's forgetfulness now remember what i told you on the word to remit forgiveness for you all and that it will be returned back to satan also the word remit is that something is in one place it was sent to this place and then this that was sent is sent to another place your sins when they are remitted you are forgiven but i believe in the book of revelation it says speaks about how the the sea gave its own la tierra and the earth gave of its own and the books were open there will be a judgment but you all will not be judged because where you find holy and perfect life is in the blood of jesus that's what does make that man unicode a son of god [Music] god never remembers you to be a sinner you're a son you're a daughter that makes the sin disappear he says in the message the sea of forgetfulness is christ's blood that was said for you and therefore you and god our father and son by jesus christ's grace not for something and we know that the lord stayed with abraham to have fellowship el through the blood [Music] the musicians can also come forward and to our human eye to drink blood it's something crazy i would never do that in drinking the blood of jesus branham brother branham says there's only one there's only one way provided by god for anything preached in 1963 paragraph 253 and if you close your eyes jesus how many want to drink the blood of jesus it's something that the bible clearly says that jesus said and juan says in john 6 50 53. jesus if you don't drink the blood of jesus the perfect life [Music] is [Music] tamieno complete i will also fulfill it with i see just like melchizedek and fellowship with abraham of jesus christ that was in that blood that's now in our hearts to be judged you won't be accused of jesus because the blood of jesus that came unto you like you don't break out that you drank it took away that seed we've confessed it we couldn't have any [Music] [Music] [Music] is i decided to go back into our original stairs [Music] fellowship with god [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this evening okay it's [Music] [Music]
