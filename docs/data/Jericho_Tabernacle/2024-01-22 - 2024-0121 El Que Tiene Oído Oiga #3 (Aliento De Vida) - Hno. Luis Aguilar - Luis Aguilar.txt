believe this morning he's ministering in the Church of brother ad and I believe also brother maros Sana Jr is out of the out of town we'll be praying for them that way they can return safely am how many of you have your Bible with you we're going to open our Bibles amen uh this morning we we will be continuing with the thought that we've been having this is now the third message and the subtitle we want to call it the breath of life amen now before we do read the scripture let us bow our heads so we may pray amen our Lord Heavenly Father this morning Lord Lord we're here to be able to hear your word to be better Christians to uh draw closer to your word now father we ask that you uh speak to each individual that's here this morning help us to accept your word and to keep your word father now father I ask that we can leave this place a thousand times better than when we came in and father we now bind every Spirit contrary to your word by the power of the Holy Spirit we pray for all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen inesis Genesis 2 verse 7 very uh it's a scripture that's very easy to find the scripture says it says and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathe into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul amen amen Brothers you may be seated we thank the musicians and as well the song leader amen we've been bringing out this series of messages and we're bringing them out from the message the spoken word is the Original Seed it's a a message that's about six hours long I do recommend that each one of you go and hear it or read it it seems that the prophet is just giving you a chunk of meat and it's a message that you have to hear at least about a thousand times to be able to understand it with God's help we'll be taking a small piece and we're hoping that God may give us the re relation now here brother vam says in the first quote that we have he says the Bible has got to be in you how many can accept that the Bible has got to be in you the word is a seed as long it's laying there it won't do nothing it's also speaking about the the womb of our mind or the womb of our hearts says but when it comes in here to the heart then it begins to manifest by the Holy Spirit The Works of God then Visions come power comes humility comes all your know it all is gone you become nothing Christ becomes alive you die and he lives and there it is because he died I live when I die he lives again and when I die he promised me life and I died out to myself so in order I can have his life and how do I do it by taking his word his seed put his seed in there by faith and believe it and then it produces exactly what the Bible said so then the Bible must be in US God's word and then the prophet says then the Visions come the scripture does tell us in Proverbs 28:19 I'm going to read it the way that it's in English it says where there is no vision the people perish says but he that keepeth the law happy is he now I want you to hear it how it is in Spanish says without prophecy the people uh go out of control but the one that keeps the law is blessed so when we we have the seed inside of us and then the Holy Spirit comes to make it come alive then we can have the vision the power the humility we stop being the one that's to know it all because now we have to be simple as God is so what uh interests me of the way that it's in English says where there is no vision the people perish now in Spanish it says without prophecy the people go out of control now for there to be a prophecy brother random explains and later on we'll go into that for there to be prophecy you need a prophet if there is no Prophet then then the people go out of control we have a prophet if you don't have a prophet I advise you to look for a prophet because without Prophet there's no prophecy and there's no prophecy then the people go out of control in other words the people just uh they uh steer off that car or maybe that furniture that has no wheels to be able to stop but the one that keeps the the law is blessed in SC field in the scoffield footnotes it says that the word a prophecy in Hebrew is a revelation of God so in other words without the revelation of God the people go out of control now where we left off the last time in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and and dwelt among us so that word or that seed was God is God but he did not only just remain as a seed or as a word but he came and manifested himself in human flesh now the word is the seed of God so that's not the only seed we have we have the uh the serpent seed the seed of discrepancy there's many seeds so those seeds sooner or later will become flesh and will dwell among us whether it's God's word or the devil's word that's the truth now brother bam says in the message the seed of discrepancy he says Judas he was the seed of the enemy and of discrepancy and he also became flesh and uh dwelt among us as the person of Judas so then every seed every word sooner or later will manifest itself now let's go to the book of Acts chapter S it's a scripture we read last time acts uh 751 here um stepen he's preaching to the crowd he's speaking about Moses he's speaking about Abraham so he reaches now the climax of his preaching of or his message and he says ye stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears so they were unable to hear God's word even though they were already hearing God's word now verse 54 it says when they heard these things they were uh uh cut to their hearts and they nashed on him with their teeth now I just want you to notice what the word of God is producing in them they are hearing God's word the Bible but as they're hearing that word it says they cut them they were cut to the hearts so what was in their heart it began to manifest itself onto their flesh they began to Nash their teeth because they were simply manifesting what was already inside them because that's what God's word does God's word shows us who we are it takes off our mask because we think that we don't need God we don't need the blood of Jesus Christ but then God's word comes and shows us that we are absolutely nothing that the works that we have are as filthy rags so they were now seeing that the word was now uncovering what was in their hearts they began to uh grow angry now you remember the last time that we spoke on Luke there are some that heard God's word and they rejoiced and these they were getting offended now let's go to Acts chapter 5 some uh chapters prior to this one let's go to verse 33 rather let's go to verse 28 now here we have the apostles you have here the Apostle [Music] Peter and they were uh taken by the council because they began to preach the gospel of God or of Jesus Christ now verse 28 saying did we not straightly command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled Jerusalem with your Doctrine and intent to bring this man's blood upon us so now the council and the high priest is telling Peter and the apostles he says I I strictly gave you a command for you not to preach this gospel here in Jerusalem because you're telling us because you're telling us that the blood of this man is on our hands but if you remember when Jesus was being crucified the people of Jerusalem they they said let this man's blood be upon us and our children now the Apostle Peter is telling them you crucified Jesus Christ now the gospel is being preached see he's saying you crucified even though we know that no one took away the life away from Jesus Christ he said no one no man can take my life I myself lay it down and I take it back up now the gospel is being preached now in verse 29 it says Peter then arose and said we ought to obey God rather than men he said I'll listen to God before I do you so then they they began to get upset now verse 33 says when they heard that they heard the gospel they rejoiced it doesn't say that it said they were cut to the heart and they took counsel to slay them it's something very tremendous what the gospel can DOI now there's another footnote from here from scoffield it says when the gospel is is preached in the power of the Holy Spirit it sometimes it convinces or produces wrath and that's tremendous when the gospel is being preached doesn't matter who's on the pulpit he will either convince you or he's just simply going to produce what's in your heart we've seen that those two examples when they heard the gospel they got offended they no longer wanted to hear the gospel because the gospel showed them who they were now let's go to Acts chapter 2 verse 36 here we have the 120 that's in the upper room now they were now in one Accord and they were now having a Revival now Peter Rises up the same Peter that preached to the council is now preaching to the 120 it's the same gospel not another gospel now Peter is not preaching a certain gospel to the 120 and another gospel to the council it's the it's the same word it's the same seed now you can see the different reaction that these people had he said that this uh Jesus whom thou Hast crucified God had made both Lord and Christ that's the same thing that Peter said to the council now notice verse 37 what the 120 say says now when they heard this now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and uh said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do what can I do because the the gospel showed them showed us that we crucified the Lord Jesus Christ and you can say brother that was 2,000 years ago when they crucified him but the prophet says that today now it still we're still crucifying him rejecting God's word as you reject God's word we're crucifying him again it's the same gospel the same Peter himself he's preaching the same gospel to the 120 and to the council now everyone hears God's word but not everyone hears God's word I'll say it again everyone hears God's word but not everyone hears God's word just like uh brother Billy Paul in his testimony he said he had his boss and he said that he had a little book of brother Branham and he gave it to his boss he said he was a bit scared because it was his boss when that boss uh finished reading that little book of the Prophet Billy Paul he went back to Billy Paul Billy Paul and he said Billy Paul he said never again give me another book like that one and he asked why he says because that man in that book he said I'm a buzzard is that right he said that same man said I was an eagle everyone hears the word of God but not everyone hears the word of God Amen some get offended some Rejoice some identify as vultures and other identify as Eagles but it's the same gospel now Jesus is the original seed and the prophet says that we have to be the Original Seed just as Jesus came each one of us has to come the same way but we come under a permissive will now the Lord Jesus Christ came from the word of God now how is it that we are Sons and Daughters of God now the answer for that we have to go to the Natural how is it that you become a son or daughter of your own natural parents you're born you didn't pick it you just simply were born from your mother and father now you were born into that family and you're a a member of that family it's the same thing in the spiritual how is it that we are Sons and Daughters of God you're born into God's family what is it that you need for a birth water blood and spirit now when we're born again now we're members of his body his word and of the Holy Spirit now the Prophet says in the following quote he says all sons of God must be the same thing yes sir to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 to be born of the water and the spirit what does it do then it brings BRS you right back again onto the place of where you should have been at the beginning see that's the reason of Christ's death bring us right back again to where sons of God we must be born of the word and the spirit now if we go to First Peter uh chapter 23 or verse 23 being born of the word and of the spirit in other words God's word and the Holy Spirit now verse 23 it says being born again in English it says it perfectly right it says being born again not of corruptible seed this is corruptible seed day by day hour by hour it's corrupting itself it says but being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible what is that Incorruptible seed by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever and that's how we are sons of God when we're born of the word and of the Holy Spirit now the word is in our hearts we hear it and it's in our hearts so then the time comes when the Holy Spirit comes and gives you the Revelation that you are a child of God that we were just simply nothing we were just mere worms and then the Holy Spirit comes and the word and then it comes to life and we realize that we need God uh now last time that we spoke just like a woman is pregnant the prophet says there there is a spirit that surrounds that woman he says the body is being shaped inside her the little arms the little feet the mouth and all that and uh in a in a certain way he has life but he's uh within his mother now we're made up of three parts which is Body Spirit and soul where does the body come from it comes from the mother it's being shaped in the mother's womb now the spirit what does where does it come from does it come from God that's right but now don't get scared what God it is of god and I'll say Amen but the prophet says he says when that spirit is surrounding the God is surrounding of this world that's tremendous right who teaches the baby how to lie what is he teach him sometimes I have my own son Lucas here said I said give me the toy and he begins to take off who teaches him that the spirit that's in him and it's in each one of us when we're born but that Soul comes from God that's why when Satan went to Eve he's very subtle and he knows exactly what he's doing he went to the mind in other words the spirit the intelligence he didn't went to the the faith or anything else he went to the intelligence or to the logical part he said now Eve just think logically That's what Satan did or the serpent did but God chose the soul amen now the prophet tells us that we have those two elements which is the mind in the soul he says that the animal does not possess a soul the animal is unaware that he's naked but as we the human race sometimes when we get a petah let's say a Chihuahua whatever sometimes you give him a little bow female as embra female they put a little dress on the Chihuahua not even the little dog know that it's naked but we know that it's naked because it doesn't no sin it has no soul but we have a soul which is a living being but it's not a living soul as we read in the beginning in Genesis 2:7 uh for those that know their Bible and I hope that the the young men and women are listening before Adam ever had Eve what happened first God formed him and breathe into him the Breath of Life he was already formed brother Adam says he was already breathing but it says he breathed into him so that he could be a living soul and then some uh verses later on that's when Eve comes and many times we say from behind the pulit it's very important that man searches for God first before he searches for the woman but we always do it backwards right but at least we've said it many times now let's go to act Acts chapter n are you awake amen if you're sleeping just at least don't snore cuz then you'll wake up your neighbor next to you okay acts 91 it says and sa who was sa he his name later on became Paul it says and saw yet breathing out threatening and Slaughter Adam was breathing in the Breath of God but now we can find this man that Saul is breathing out something that is not from God so now I can realize that God is Not the Only power that is here on Earth I'm realizing that God's word is not the only seed there's God and then there's the devil you're either breathing in God or you're either breathing in what's from the devil I don't want you to miss uh the focus of the Revelation now this man it says that he was breathing out something that was against God's word but he then God knocked him off his high horse uh verses later on he was asking from letters from Damascus because he in his mind he was thinking that he was rendering a service to God oh what a tremendous thing sometimes we think that we're giving God a service when in reality we're persecuting Jesus Christ okay oh you say well I I have the word I have the quot right here he thought that he was rendering a service to God going to the people to bring them and throw them into jail and then the light knocks them off and he says saw saw why per why persecutes that way he was not persecuting the people he was persecuting the Lord Jesus Christ that's why we have to be very careful when we greet our brother because he's the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ you are the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ that's why it's so important that you smile to everyone it says now and saw yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter now in in in Spanish it uses the word breathe in so he was breathing in he was breathing in something that was contrary to God's word and and then in English it says he was breathing out what's inside you it will come out it will come out he was breathing out threatenings and Slaughter like brother Eli said on Friday it's very easy we want to judge everyone we want to bring everyone to a trial and that's what exactly what wanted to do threatenings and Slaughter now let's go to Revelations 13:15 now for them uh for them that know their message now in Revelations 13 it's speaking of the United States now here we find a little beast that was as a lamb that came out of the Earth with two horns now we know that that is the United States and it says that he spake as the dragon how does a dragon speak to be able to know how the dragon speaks we have to go to Genesis how did the serpent speak well God said this but that that's fine this Grace don't worry about it that's how the the council themselves speak in this the denomination so this little lamb began to speak as a dragon and that dragon is the Beast and that little lamb is the image of the Beast now what is an image now for example I have my son he looks like me he talks like me he stands up like me he's my image now it's the same thing this little lamb was the image unto the Beast the image of the Dragon now verse 15 now listen how it says it in Spanish and then in English it said and he had power to give life unto the image of the Beast now this Beast or Dragon he filled this little image or this Little Lamb with uh life so we can see how tremendous life or breath is now in Psalms 23:4 it says like this says though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me for it says for thy rod and thy sta in Spanish it say it shall fill me with breath amen they it shall Comfort Me Now what is the breath that you're breathing in we can see that there's either one or the other the one that is of god or the one of the devil it says thy rod and thy staff it says in Spanish it shall fill me with breath amen now Ezekiel 37 this is a well-known scripture that every one of us knows here we can see the prophet Ezekiel he finds himself in the valley of dry bones verse one says the hand of the Lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the Lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of Bones and caused me to passed by them round about and behold there were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answer oh Lord God thou knowest and now it says in verse four and again he said unto me prophesy How can there be a prophecy only by a prophet only a prophet can bring prophecy now brother ROM also says that a uh in the New Testament he says a modern Prophet is a preacher but I believe that you understand both things he said prophesy to these bones in other words preach to these bones preach the gospel the original word to these bones and say unto them oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord Lord these bones had to hear the word of God the gospel does not change God's word doesn't change it's the same yesterday today and the same forever now today uh the young people are in a fashion of old school they want to have old uh devices old iPods like a certain vintage style amen but why won't they go to the original word that's old school it doesn't the word doesn't change the word will never change it's the same yesterday the same today and the same forever like that song that the prophet said that he loved it was good enough for apost Paul good enough for me he he said oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord that's why it's really important for you to hear God's word hear the word of the Prophet to listen to the prophet because those Tes will not change it still carries the same effect for today it's tremendous what brother Emanuel tells us that when he plays the tape it speaks of today and I'm a witness of that and I believe many of you are witnesses to that because the word does not have beginning nor end that's why the prophet says we have to be born of the word once you're born of the word therefore you have no beginning and then you have no end oh ye Dry Bones hear the word of the Lord verse five thus sayith the Lord God unto these bones it says be uh behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live and did you catch it in English says behold I will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live in English it uses the word breath amen so this Prophet is prophesying or preaching and he's saying the same thing that we're saying today hear the word of the Lord then that Breath of Life came it will come into you and you shall live now in verse seven let's read verse six says and I will lay senu upon you and I will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and he shall live and ye shall know that I am the Lord these uh these bones were dead there was no breath in them but that breath came from God it came from God's word came into them those bones got up and then a flesh Came Upon them verse seven prophesy as it was as I was commanded so I prophesied as I was commanded and there was a noise as I prophesied and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone all those bones began to move when they heard the prophecy of the prophet when they heard the word of God that's right it's really important that we must move these bones must move if you don't move those bones will become stiff I'll say it again as we're growing if you don't move those bones will become stiff that's why when you hear God's word there has to be an action it has to produce something and it produces life maybe you don't preach maybe you cannot be an usher but you can do something for God you can hear the word of God and that bone will connect to the other bone and they'll link up to the other B join together as a group because uh Ezekiel Saw that the house of Israel all the bones were scattered abroad they were just scattered all over the place they were completely dry but then the word of the Lord came in verse eight and when I held low the Senus and the flesh Came Upon them and the skin covered them above and but there was no breath in them there is the the body being formed that word was then formed in you but the Holy Spirit has not yet arrived verse n verse n then he said unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus say the Lord God come from the Four Winds oh breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live now if you notice in verse n now in Spanish it says it like this it says prophesy to the spirit and the the spirit is in a lowercase and it says it twice and then the the third time how you say uppercase mayuscula mayuscula uh the word in Spanish for spirit is an uppercase that's referring to uh the Holy Spirit it says come and uh prophesy upon these and breathe upon these slain and that they may live so then the Holy Spirit it gives us life we're formed but what we need is the life that comes from God now if you remember in St John 2020 when uh Jesus raised from the dead he appeared unto his disciples the Lord showed him his hands and his side and says and that the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord and Jesus said unto them peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so sent I you now he's speaking this Jesus breathed on them s Juan 2022 uh John Jesus was there with the disciples he showed them his side showed his hands he says I am the Lord Jesus Christ I'm not a spirit I'm not just a vision because now I have Flesh and Bones he says as my father sent me so I send you and Jesus breathe on them and said receive ye the Holy Ghost just like the prophet Ezekiel he breathed on those Dry Bones so they may have life likewise the Lord Jesus Christ breathe on his disciples to give them the spirit so that they may have life even though we know and understand that the fullness of the Holy Spirit did not come until the upper room experience now let's go back to verse 10 in Ezekiel it says so I prophesied as he commanded me and the Spirit came into them and they lived and stood upon their feet an exceeding great Army so when you receive the Holy Spirit when when at one point you did not have life we were just merely dry bones but then the word of God came God breathed into us his own life now we can live we're standing on our feet we then become a soldier in the army of the Lord you are a soldier in God's Army brother Bram says that we're not at a picnic we're at a battlefield and let me say the devil is not here just to merely wound you the devil is here to knock you down and the devil's here to kill you and the devil is here to completely finish you off he's not here just to take you out of church he wants to finish by killing you that's why we must to know the tactics of the devil the devil does not come with anything else he brings the Bible he brings the message and we think that we're giving God a service the devil wants to kill us that's why we need God's armor to have God's discernment that Breath of Life inside of us because that Holy Ghost that is inside of us will be able to help us to detect because the devil he wants to kill us he wants to finish us off he's not merely content that you just stay at home he's not just content that you don't hear the prophetes he wants to kill off your influence he wants to bury you and he wants to end you because he knows you're a soldier of Jesus Christ but this morning we're unmasking the devil you're a soldier of Jesus Christ we can't do anything on our own but when we possess the Breath of Life in us this Breath of Life is not the air that we just breathe this breath of of Life comes from God something that comes from God is eternal so you are Eternal now he formed Adam and he breathed life into him why so that he can be the god of the earth now Saul he was breathing out threats and and Slaughter but Adam was breathing in the life of God uh in the message questions and answers he says now the little fellow he's got life speaking about the little baby that's in inside the mother's womb he's got life he says CUA the little cells are moving and kicking after about three months or four and then he's kicking and moving but yet he isn't born yet but as soon as he is brought into the world the doctor mother or someone holds him up that's what happens when a a baby is born they naturally when they're born they begin to cry they begin to to cry out because life came into him or her when that baby is born but it doesn't move there's a concern there the doctors and nurses are moving around it's an it's an urgent need that baby we must breathe they have to move it's something critical it's a it's a matter of seconds if not that baby will be lost it was formed it was there but now has to come out of the womb just like us we're formed we're ready to have life once we're coming out of the womb of the word out of God's womb we must have life then the Holy Spirit comes in if the Holy Spirit does not come in then there's death I'll say it again we're formed but if the Holy Spirit does not come then there's death we're just theologians of the word well I know everything I know everything that brother we got to correct this one one this one this one we got to correct every we're just Sauls breathing out threatenings and Slaughter when we possess God's Own Breath of Life we have Grace we have eternal life blessed be the name of the lord it's the same gospel that the apostles preach that we Preach Today it has never changed that's why it's very important for the Holy Spirit to come because the Holy Spirit does correct you but with love the theologians do correct you but just hitting you you love me Brothers I love you I love you with all my heart if I could I'd give my life for every one of you but Jesus already did so but I have something it's it's the blood of Jesus Christ how the prophet says he says now the doctor the mother someone they hold up the feet and if the baby does not move he gives he gives that baby a spanking so that he can react not because we want to just hit the baby this is something critical for nine months the baby was in the womb and that mother wants to hold her baby it's something critical maybe the baby won't like it but it must have life so then he begins to breathe as soon as he breathes in the breath of life then he becomes a living soul and the prophet says that's how sometimes you're ready to receive the Holy Ghost you're in your birth pains you want to be born the prophet asks the question he says how many of you are in that condition in this moment wanting the baptism of the Holy GH really want to know what it is the prophet says he says want to get into it who wants the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the prophet say rais up your how many want the Holy Spirit not only do you want to be in the wom you want to be born as a child of God and it's not only the word it's the word and the Holy Spirit and both produce a child of God because the serpent had the word he had the Bible he had the message he does not have the Holy Ghost he only have the word but we need both the word and the Holy Spirit says you are in birth pain you're wanting to be born he says what you need is the gos spanking and here in parenthesis his brother Ram claps his hands he says and you scream out Glory almost closing next quote now here he's speaking of Adam he said now now he says he breathed in that wind and when is what you breathe into your nost he says when God formed Adam he said Adam was breathing he was breathing he said but what God did he says he breathed into him the breath of eternal life not only life but eternal life it says and then he became a living Soul a soul that can't die now he says now watch he says we're going to get into honey Plum to your elbows notice he breathed the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal Soul because because God breathed not what nature done but what God did breathe the breath of life into his nost and he became a living soul but God in a special way upon Adam breathed the Breath of Life of eternal life and he became an eternal person with God he had power like God he had an he was an amateure God he was the god of the earth not the god of Heaven now God of the earth when God breathed into him eternal life he was breathing normally by nature but then God came he breathed on him and now he had etal life and that produced an adate God a god of the Earth not of heaven but of the earth now with that power inside him he Ruled the Earth and that produced a Son of God that's exactly what God wants to do with us taking us to the beginning like Adam from the word the Holy Spirit having that bre breath of eternal life to be amateur Gods gods of this Earth taking us back to the beginning and one day God's children will become Gods again Jesus said is it not written in your law ye are Gods isn't it written in your Bible that you are gods blessed be the name of God now we're in training we're in training we have the word we have the Holy Spirit and he he's here to breathe eternal life you to rule to be God or be gods of this Earth what Earth this Earth we're going to come back and take over this Earth but we're now practicing we're in training but firstly before we can come to take over this Earth we have to take control and take over this Earth that's why the word came the Holy Spirit came so that you can be an amateur God so you can uh control this Earth firstly you have to uh take control over this Earth before you can have control over this Natural Earth you first have to take control over your own self I'll say it again once uh before we come back to take over and control this Earth You have to take control over your own Earth We're uh the elements the body of the Lord Jesus Christ you have to take control of your hands and control what you're watching what you're hearing what you're speaking because the Bible says that that little member the tongue it's like a fire you have to even control every member of your body to uh control it in we have God's word we have the Holy Spirit and God is here to breathe eternal life into you to be children of God amateur Gods you love God uh please stand why don't you um give it a clap off to Lord Jesus Christ this morning amen let us pray our Lord heavenly father father we're very happy with you oh Lord
