[35:37] if you can open your bibles there to

[35:44] says watch and pray
[35:48] that ye
[35:49] enter not into temptation
[35:52] the spirit indeed is willing but the
[35:54] flesh is weak

[36:24] and i forgot my classes i'm sorry i'm
[36:26] getting older
[36:32] i want this i want this the youth to
[36:34] hear this scripture uh
[36:40] flee also youthful lust
[36:44] but follow righteousness faith charity
[36:47] peace
[36:48] with them that call on the lord
[36:51] out of a pure heart
[37:02] but foolish and unlearned questions
[37:04] avoid

[37:16] one more scripture before we sit down
[37:18] matthew

[38:04] deliver us
[38:05] from evil for thine is the kingdom and
[38:08] the power and the glory forever amen
[38:42] i want to just give a few small
[38:44] testimonies of uh
[38:46] that uh that i have that's that's
[38:48] happened in my life
[38:54] and um
[38:56] i want to start off
[38:57] you guys know i'm the oldest child of
[38:59] brother john g alvarez
[39:06] and my mother guadalupe alvarez
[39:10] [Music]
[39:12] um
[39:14] i i grew up in a christian home yo chris
[39:18] christiano i believe since the day i was
[39:20] born
[39:24] examples
[39:26] of
[39:35] i believe i was i'll start when i was
[39:37] young and i was maybe i believe my mom
[39:39] might correct me but
[39:41] uh after uh
[39:43] i was about five years old
[39:49] i was seven years old and uh
[39:51] i fell
[39:52] off the high chair the common question
[40:06] which is kind of a bad sign you know
[40:09] that was saturday night and then
[40:11] sunday sunday morning my mom would go to
[40:14] the
[40:16] to the to the gift room
[40:24] and she would go every sunday morning
[40:25] and they'd pray and
[40:27] she was at her you know and her post of
[40:29] duty i believe
[40:36] and my dad stayed back
[40:38] with the kids
[40:39] and he uh
[40:42] he people uh he took me he picked me up
[40:44] tried to take me to take me to church
[40:46] and i wouldn't respond i was
[40:48] i believe i was unconscious
[40:57] so
[40:58] they took they rushed my dad took us and
[41:00] took me to the church and my mom was
[41:02] just coming out
[41:03] of the gift room or they called her out
[41:05] or don't remember
[41:12] and um
[41:14] she
[41:16] she found out that her son was
[41:18] i was literally dying
[41:21] at five years old
[41:26] they thought i was dying
[41:30] they rushed me to the hospital uh
[41:34] and they um
[41:36] they find out that i had a cut not a cut
[41:39] it was a
[41:40] scratch on my brain
[41:46] which would cause brain damage
[41:51] sorry i probably shouldn't be normal
[41:54] maybe i'm not normal
[41:59] but thank god you know i'm here
[42:03] um
[42:04] and so starting at that at that point at
[42:07] a young age i i i didn't know at that
[42:09] time
[42:14] there was there was someone already
[42:16] calling on on the lord's name
[42:23] so i really believe
[42:25] that
[42:26] from there that was one of my
[42:28] testimonies that the day has come
[42:32] says
[42:35] that i can speak it that it's from when
[42:37] i was a little boy
[42:42] obviously my mother told me because i
[42:44] don't remember much of it
[42:49] but i
[42:50] i do know that
[42:52] the doctors gave me a medication
[43:06] so i believe my dad was always out
[43:08] ministering i believe they were going to
[43:10] colorado
[43:17] and they went on the trip and my mom and
[43:19] dad uh they were on the trip and like i
[43:21] think it was like two weeks that they
[43:23] went out
[43:28] and when they came back they realized
[43:30] that
[43:31] my mom had forgot that the medic
[43:33] medication i ran out of the medication
[43:37] s
[43:40] she went to
[43:42] to ask the doctor again for if to give
[43:44] me the medication
[43:51] the doctor says don't give it to him
[43:52] he's healed
[43:54] he doesn't need that anymore
[43:59] so
[44:01] i've had and obviously everybody has
[44:03] gone through
[44:05] trials in their lives even from young we
[44:08] don't sometimes we may not remember but
[44:10] those are trials
[44:12] that our parents go through you know
[44:36] you guys probably some of you guys know
[44:38] that uh i'll tell you a little story a
[44:40] little testimony
[44:41] um
[44:43] testimonial that i uh
[44:46] i love to play basketball even if i'm a
[44:48] big guy you know i'm you mean kantara i
[44:50] mean contact
[44:53] and sometimes they get a little rough
[44:55] you know um
[45:03] and um i guess god uh
[45:05] roughed me up one time and he i almost
[45:07] they poked my hour my eye out
[45:15] they took me out literally almost took
[45:17] it out cassie literally
[45:20] and um
[45:21] when did the
[45:23] the hospital
[45:24] emergency fuel hospital
[45:28] god save my eye dio salvojo um i should
[45:32] be
[45:33] i don't want to say the word but
[45:36] you know blind
[45:38] you name it you know that's what i
[45:40] should be no quiero de sierras
[46:11] so i grew up in a christian home like
[46:13] like i said and
[46:15] uh you know always went to church
[46:21] i do i do thank god for for always
[46:25] protecting me from
[46:38] and that's going to kind of take me a
[46:39] little bit into what i just want to
[46:41] speak a little bit yes
[46:45] um
[46:46] into what i want to say tonight just a
[46:48] little bit
[46:51] about trials and temptations
[47:05] so
[47:06] um actually i'm going to tell you a
[47:08] little story first that i heard the
[47:09] other day
[47:12] [Music]
[47:14] the testimonies that i had when i was a
[47:16] younger boy
[47:22] kind of relate to this to this story
[47:27] i heard it was a pastor that was on a
[47:29] plane
[47:33] and he was reading his bible
[47:36] the person next to him told him that he
[47:37] didn't believe in god
[47:42] and then uh the
[47:44] the guy next to him they they uh you
[47:46] know they had a conversation that he did
[47:48] not believe in god and the pastor was
[47:50] like thought in his mind
[47:58] so the pastor start praying and start
[48:00] saying well lord you know i don't know
[48:02] what to tell him anymore you know their
[48:04] conversation kind of ended
[48:12] and uh
[48:13] they were gonna about to land into
[48:15] chicago established
[48:19] and
[48:21] there was a tremendous turbulence on the
[48:24] plane
[48:27] and the same guy that said that
[48:30] he didn't believe in god
[48:45] and the pastor turned around and looked
[48:46] at him and smirked at him
[48:48] the plane was still
[48:50] shaking
[48:59] yes and then uh the the
[49:02] they land after
[49:05] very strong turbulence
[49:10] and obviously the pastor said that that
[49:12] was his chance to ask him do you believe
[49:14] in god now
[49:41] so
[49:43] that was just a little a little and and
[49:45] that kind of brings me into
[49:47] how people
[49:49] call on the lord in in in desperate
[49:51] times only seems like it is
[50:11] and i don't remember who came knocking
[50:13] to the door
[50:16] my mom was sick give me one more inferma
[50:19] my wife i think
[50:20] called me and
[50:22] i ran out of the shower and ran
[50:31] and i screamed i remember screaming to
[50:33] god in desperation
[50:37] and
[50:39] i don't think it should be like that
[50:40] until we're to a desperate you know a
[50:43] desperate situation
[50:50] i believe that that we need to uh
[50:54] be pure in heart
[50:58] and call on the on the lord's name all
[51:00] the time
[51:03] so that that's what i want to speak
[51:05] about tonight a little bit is to call on
[51:07] the lord's name
[51:14] and so um
[51:18] i want i want to
[51:21] i want to go a little bit it might sound
[51:23] like i'm changing a little bit of of my
[51:25] thought but i'm not
[51:27] scared
[51:32] um
[51:38] so it says
[51:40] uh in every temptation
[51:47] we need to call on jesus name
[51:52] jesus so
[51:53] temptation i read a little bit and
[51:56] looked in the dictionary of what
[51:59] they say temptation is
[52:06] and it says temptation is a desire
[52:09] to engage in a short-term urges
[52:21] [Music]
[52:27] i want to say that again and see if if
[52:29] you guys
[52:30] listen to what what they're saying here
[52:32] the temptation is
[52:34] dictionary
[52:41] it says temptation is a desire to engage
[52:44] in a short
[52:54] for enjoyment right and that it threat
[52:57] it threatens long-term goals
[53:06] so temptations they're like small last
[53:08] temptations
[53:10] little short term
[53:12] short term so muy pequenos
[53:14] corto plazo and they have they threaten
[53:17] the longer goal that we have
[53:25] and some of the other definitions that
[53:27] uh that i that i read
[53:31] i'm going to read them
[53:34] this temptation is the desire to do
[53:36] something especially something wrong
[53:38] or unwise
[53:45] and word similar to temptation is desire
[53:48] urge
[53:49] itch or impulse this
[53:52] synonymous
[53:59] all this is mostly stuff that i found on
[54:02] the dictionary
[54:06] so i wanted to kind of see what what out
[54:07] in the world what they describe of what
[54:10] that is temptation right
[54:16] now i want i want to go
[54:18] here
[54:20] to
[54:21] what brother branham says i look at the
[54:23] cinema just a little bit if you if
[54:24] you're patient with me here um
[54:28] um i took these out of some quotes of
[54:30] now we heard what
[54:33] um
[54:35] what they believe temptation is
[54:38] estos
[54:41] and i have i have to agree to some of
[54:43] them because it's it's you know it
[54:45] explains to me a lot
[54:50] but i do want to
[54:52] i do want to read
[54:54] these quotes
[54:55] that i read
[55:00] and i'm going to read it from
[55:03] the deity of jesus christ
[55:10] if you're patient with me please
[55:18] and i didn't have a chance to put it up
[55:20] there
[55:24] and this is this is what we we really
[55:27] want to pay attention to is the word of
[55:28] god
[55:36] and
[55:37] and have in mind of what we're trying to
[55:39] i'm trying to explain is
[55:40] the temptation
[55:50] but that
[55:51] is the god
[55:53] the creator living in you and giving you
[55:56] all the powers
[55:57] and you're in possession of anything
[55:59] that he had
[56:01] so is it in you to abstain from evil
[56:13] so
[56:14] it in so in you to abstain from evil to
[56:17] do good to shun evil
[56:20] and to flee to righteousness to turn
[56:22] away from temptation
[56:30] malice hatred strife envy and so forth
[56:37] turn away from it
[56:41] for that'll take him from your heart
[56:46] if you will receive him
[56:49] embrace him
[56:50] and love him
[56:52] and hold him in your heart and love him
[56:57] i can tell you church together in that
[56:59] kind of power
[57:03] has the power to bind the heavens
[57:08] heal the sick
[57:10] open the eyes
[57:29] why it's recognizing the power of
[57:31] almighty god in your heart
[57:37] there he is in deity
[57:40] amen
[57:42] that that to me
[57:43] you know it's
[57:45] it's the word of god so i really can't
[57:47] i'm not here i can't add anything else
[57:49] yes
[57:55] yes um
[57:57] so
[57:58] be patient with me please
[58:00] thank you
[58:01] for
[58:04] i
[58:11] [Music]
[58:18] you know none of us have a a message
[58:20] right
[58:25] all we have to do is repeat what he says
[58:28] is there's nothing
[58:30] nothing nothing else to to to add
[58:38] here's another quote that i liked uh as
[58:40] i read and i studied a little bit it
[58:42] says
[58:43] i said oh yes you can be you you can be
[58:45] temptation but his
[58:47] oh yes you can be temptation
[59:03] existed
[59:04] but his grace is sufficient
[59:07] that's right i see his grace is
[59:08] sufficient
[59:11] it's strange how smart men can sometimes
[59:13] get off track isn't it yes
[59:19] i heard a man preaching one of the most
[59:20] brilliant preachers
[59:25] pretty near compare with brother baxter
[59:27] [Music]
[59:29] similar in comparison
[59:31] now you see what i think of brother
[59:32] baxter
[59:38] i think he's a real preacher
[59:44] i believe you'll agree with me that's
[59:46] right
[59:50] so this i want to read a little a little
[59:52] bit lower where it says
[59:56] and he got on on the villain he said
[59:59] sickness is of god
[1:00:06] this is what brother branham says it's a
[1:00:08] look at this
[1:00:09] he said no matter what what we do
[1:00:12] important
[1:00:32] when you have arthritis
[1:00:35] arthritis rheumatitis and things
[1:00:39] say i love your arthritis
[1:00:43] or so forth
[1:00:46] and the lord give it to me you see
[1:00:50] you know
[1:00:52] the reason i read this because sometimes
[1:00:54] it seems like brother branham was like
[1:00:58] you don't understand it
[1:01:05] and and even
[1:01:06] to you know you're tempted to
[1:01:10] me i'm tempted to like question right
[1:01:12] sometimes
[1:01:18] that's why i read this this this quote
[1:01:20] here
[1:01:23] that
[1:01:24] that's wrong
[1:01:26] because the only the only sin there is
[1:01:29] is unbelief
[1:01:33] i can stand here and be and to be
[1:01:35] sincere with you that
[1:01:37] i've had a point where i doubted the
[1:01:38] word of god you know growing up as a
[1:01:41] as a
[1:01:42] message believer in my whole life
[1:02:05] is here
[1:02:07] our doubt our human
[1:02:09] person
[1:02:10] the flesh is is
[1:02:13] temptation
[1:02:19] i hope i don't lose you guys this is
[1:02:20] this i'm preaching to myself
[1:02:27] i think that's why i'm i'm up here
[1:02:30] but uh i'm going to read you another few
[1:02:33] more quotes
[1:02:37] and um
[1:02:56] this is now we have
[1:02:58] we have not got it in full this
[1:03:14] now
[1:03:26] and this this is where i like yesterday
[1:03:30] but jesus will help us in every
[1:03:32] temptation
[1:03:37] and now when i do wrong
[1:03:42] i'm ready to repent
[1:03:45] and he says anyone else
[1:03:49] is that wants to live right with god
[1:03:54] you don't desire to do wrong
[1:04:10] expera if i confess my wrong si yo
[1:04:13] confias
[1:04:15] gods just to forgive me
[1:04:20] and the same thing is when you when you
[1:04:22] got sick
[1:04:25] it's no sign you're immune from sickness
[1:04:31] but every time god is willing to deliver
[1:04:32] you from that sickness
[1:04:38] every time that you get sick you go to
[1:04:40] god and ask him
[1:04:44] every time
[1:04:45] he's willing to deliver you because
[1:04:47] there is an atonement
[1:04:53] it's upon your faith
[1:04:56] in that atonement which is your
[1:04:57] redemption
[1:05:01] and if we know that this joy that we
[1:05:02] have just been the earnest money on what
[1:05:05] lays ahead is
[1:05:11] what will it be when
[1:05:13] we draw the full benefit of the policy
[1:05:18] beneficial completed
[1:05:22] how many believe that
[1:05:24] it's it's the word of god i'm not i
[1:05:25] don't want to add anything i'm just
[1:05:27] reading from
[1:05:28] what brother branham has brought
[1:05:34] him
[1:05:35] um
[1:05:36] it's just something that that's been on
[1:05:38] my heart about
[1:05:40] how the youth is
[1:05:44] here and i know it's a youth service
[1:05:49] how how the youth are tempted
[1:05:52] um
[1:05:53] in in many many ways the differences
[1:05:58] even as we're old sometimes i'm tempted
[1:05:59] to run people off the road
[1:06:01] you know get mad you
[1:06:15] he said
[1:06:16] that
[1:06:19] temptation is not sin
[1:06:24] no especially but to heed to temptation
[1:06:27] is sin
[1:06:31] so
[1:06:33] it sounds like it's he's like saying it
[1:06:35] contrary but what he's saying is
[1:06:38] we live in the in the flesh
[1:06:44] and every day as long as we're alive we
[1:06:46] have to live in the flesh
[1:06:50] and trials and temptations
[1:06:54] um
[1:06:56] we have to call in the name of the lord
[1:06:57] jesus christ
[1:07:01] no matter what you know no matter what
[1:07:04] what what's facing us
[1:07:09] um
[1:07:10] we have to take everything in the name
[1:07:12] of the lord jesus christ
[1:07:16] there is no other name above his name
[1:07:20] um
[1:07:21] his mercy and grace is sufficient for
[1:07:24] everything
[1:07:25] recorded
[1:07:28] um
[1:07:30] let me read one more quote and i won't
[1:07:32] take much much longer
[1:07:36] on this one in the true easter seal
[1:07:40] no more
[1:07:47] this is when satan took jesus up to the
[1:07:50] top of the mountain for temptation
[1:07:53] jesus
[1:07:56] he showed him all the kingdoms of the
[1:07:58] world
[1:08:00] now that was all that was and all that
[1:08:02] would be
[1:08:04] here
[1:08:06] and all the kingdoms of the world
[1:08:10] and he said these are mine
[1:08:14] and they're still his young you know
[1:08:18] i don't want to add it's just
[1:08:20] that's what what i see and he says
[1:08:23] i can make them fight.
[1:08:29] i can make them do this or anything
[1:08:34] and he claimed the kingdoms of the world
[1:08:36] reclaimed
[1:08:39] so then we can see how green and
[1:08:40] selfishness comes into politics
[1:08:47] we can see then where it is in the
[1:08:49] church and the church leaders
[1:09:02] now watch that same old greed that
[1:09:03] started in the garden in eden
[1:09:09] that put a bad sail on one and the right
[1:09:11] sail on
[1:09:12] on the other
[1:09:13] so
[1:09:17] come right down into the times of our
[1:09:19] lord jesus
[1:09:23] here on earth
[1:09:26] he was given a trial
[1:09:28] by what was called justice a court of
[1:09:31] justice they're looking for your mother
[1:09:38] there wasn't one thing that they could
[1:09:39] find against him
[1:09:43] that was the political side
[1:09:46] of politico they couldn't find nothing
[1:09:47] against him
[1:09:50] even so much as pilate himself says i
[1:09:53] find no fault in him
[1:09:59] and then it comes to the church
[1:10:13] to cooperate with that same spirit that
[1:10:15] was in the church
[1:10:20] that was in politics
[1:10:23] to show that if satan lost his battle
[1:10:25] here
[1:10:28] he still had something in reserve
[1:10:32] he could fall right back to the church
[1:10:41] and they crucified him
[1:10:57] no
[1:10:58] amen amen and i'm talking to myself
[1:11:03] um
[1:11:07] i want to take everything in in the in
[1:11:09] the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:11:14] every step of my life
[1:11:17] every every minute of my life
[1:11:20] let's let's put everything in god's
[1:11:22] hands
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:29] everything that we go through as
[1:11:32] personally
[1:11:35] as a church
[1:11:38] as friends and families como amigos
[1:11:41] familia everything we do let's take it
[1:11:43] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:11:49] are you please stand i'm i'm finished
[1:11:51] this is
[1:11:54] so
[1:11:55] just just to summarize a little bit of
[1:11:57] the little thought that i had was
[1:12:03] you know we have trials and temptations
[1:12:05] yes
[1:13:02] your name is holy lord jesus
[1:13:06] you're the only one
[1:13:09] lord jesus that we can run to it

[1:13:29] help us lord

[1:13:48] simple
[1:13:49] and i pray lord that we call on your
[1:13:51] holy name lord jesus
[1:13:55] because we don't call on any other
[1:13:58] and
