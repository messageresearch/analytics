thankful for what God has been doing for us and with us and we're thankful what the Lord is here with us this morning how many are you how many are your expectations this morning to leave out to live better than what we came in to receive that gift from God Amen so let's let's open up our Bibles on the scripture that is very well known in John 3 16. as always we'd like to thank our pastor brother Ordonez for the trust he's always given us to stand behind his Pulpit to speak on the word of God is amen I also would like to thank the Lord for everything John 3 16. for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life just like you are standing let's bow our heads let's bow our hearts yes the heavenly father we come this morning Lord approaching your throne of mercy and Grace asking you Lord that you may please help us this morning we have nothing else to speak but Lord father may you speak through these lips you open up the hearts of your people and Lord may they not leave empty-handed this morning may they not leave with that problem that they have in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may take your seats like to thank the song leader and The Magicians this morning and each and every single one of you for and for making welcome the Lord Jesus Christ and this morning we're going to speak on a very simple small subject we're going to entitle it God's gifts wanna speak on something very simple and down to earth because that we understand that that's how that's how God came down he came in Simplicity yes and he reveals himself in Simplicity amen how many you love the Lord this morning amen how many know that that God gives gifts hey man come in he's a if I can say it this way hopefully it doesn't sound like religious he gave a Christmas gift if you look in brother branham's messages brother Rams uses that phrase God's Christmas gifts now if you look that up there now I'd like to read just a couple quotes before we start our message and it's brother Ram says here yeah I have the slides in Spanish I don't have them in English so you can just please bear with me it always it's always good to come to the house of the Lord it's always good to come to the house of the Lord but much better seems like in these Christmas and New Years and holidays in this special days so it's always good to come to the house of the Lord but it seems a little bit better when we come during the Christmas time in the New York Times and these special holiday times seems like it has a special little blessing left for us it's just too bad that we can't have this Christmas feeling all the time it's too bad so so I want to say something we hope we put things in Balance this morning that the prophet of God William Mary and Branham William Aaron Brown seventh angel messenger is talking about Christmas amen and he says that it's too bad that That Christmas Feeling we don't have it all the time people are waving at you saying the Lord bless you that's good I like that one thing about Christmas that that that that that feeling is this that people are talking to one another people are letting The Grudges go they're forgiving one another they're waving at each other you're going inside the grocery store oh God bless you Merry Christmas you're at your work and like for us Barbers you finished with your clients the Lord bless you Merry Christmas it's a very and the prophet of God says I like that about Christmas it's just a shame that we can't have this all year round it seems like on the 25th of Christmas everything is for everybody's forgiving one another everyone is saying hello to one another but on the 26th of December we start again with our problems there's there's a there's a a story that I heard I heard brother Garcia said one time he says that there was this old lady and she had she had this dispute with this other old lady there was her next door neighbor yes and she this lady started she got sick and she was about to die so she started calling up all of her friends and everybody that she had problems with Amigos and starting to straighten everything out so she called The Neighbor Next Door she sent her little granddaughter and said go bring me the vecina next door and so the the little sick lady is laying in the bed let's just give him names it was Maria and Guadalupe Guadalupe Maria tells Guadalupe Guadalupe Guadalupe we've had problems for many years your dog barks all the time and this sir we just had so many problems throughout the years this problem still goes on so let's not be like that let's forgive one another this Christmas spirit let it be all year long now we understand that the prophet God says that that Jesus Christ was not born on Christmas he was born in April the custom of the world just made it happen like that that's how it is yes yes but as let's just read another quote in the same message God's rap gift paragraph six in English in English it says and then I want to take this time to express to each and every one of you how grateful I am to you for your Christmas cards and Gifts foreign amen amen and the things that we received at our house I certainly thank you with all my heart and certainly did US good this morning he says I got a little boy small enough yet to kind of want a Christmas tree and we have it in the room and my friends my friends from around different places that had come in either Mis Amigos laying under the tree so brother Branham had a Christmas tree all right so you do how you want to take it but the RAM says and the deity of Jesus Christ says now they got some trees they cut it down they make Christmas trees for the kids that's all right I'm not kicking against that but the thing of it is they put more on Christmas tree then they do for Christo the Christmas tree that's all right I'm not kicking against that but the thing of it is they put more on the Christmas tree then they do for Christ and we find that every day of the year you hardly hear anything about Christ anything about God because it's offensive it offends the people they want to speak about the the Easter Bunny they want to speak about the Christmas tree but they never want to speak about Christ as yours go on it starts to get less and less and less so it gets to a point where they don't even say in English it's Christmas [Music] [Music] the problem that I have is that we don't put Christ back in our home foreign and the reason why we do all of these things now as we start to to see when Jesus was born I understand that he was born in Bethlehem uh and we see that the founders were was Rahab and the general from Joshua's Army and we see that Rahab married the general they had a son a son named Solomon or salmon now that's not the Solomon that that we hear about the one who built the temple our noise so boaz's grandmother was here or not here but I can probably imagine Rahab the grandmother uh and then this great Army General by the name of Joshua yes everyone will fear him when they heard his name and then he said two of his prize I had no portion or any luck on this but I received these two spies by the grace of God there was nothing that I did there was nothing that I done but I received these two spies I took them to my home they gave me a sign they told me to just put it all my family in the room and now existence there's poliboas growing up Boaz grows up and he sees this young or this lady by the name of Ruth boss and he married ruse he married a gentile they had a son named obedience in Berlin and as we see brother Rams and the message begins to narrate foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] right around the same place and where do they go they go to a Manger how many of you were here last night around amen that was really good the ones who weren't here I hope you can come next year to have Fellowship amen amen we had a little petting zoo last night I think it was a llama there too and the ones who got there kind of fresh huh all right well there's where the king of the world is because he was a lamb he wasn't born in all five-star hotel he wasn't born in uh in the biggest place in Los Angeles like the biggest fancy place up there in Los Angeles everybody missed it but he came in the most simplest manner foreign he's got a right to do it one that's giving it he has to wrap it any way that he wants to rep it doesn't make any different how it is he's got a right to do it because he's the one giving the gifts another thing the reason of it was as it was then so it wasn't customary for them to receive it the way it was wrapped they was expecting something a gift coming that will come down and chariots with Angel escort driving with fiery horses but when it comes as a little baby born in the manger little did they ever know what the scripture said I'll give this world a super science they asked for a signal one day he said I'll give it to you and it will be a super science it will be a sign that will last through all the ages a virgin shall conceive and bear a child is that's the gift that I'm going to give is but they didn't come the way that it was expecting and they turn it down it was there in the scriptures that a virgin shall conceive and we find Mary in blessed amongst all the women what was the difference she was blessed amongst all the women she was ready to receive the germ of God's Gift hasn't come the way people want it to come so they turn it down they don't want it then they want it wrapped in the kind of of a Goods that they wanted to be wrapped in they want tinsel on it they want some something flowery something that's perfumed something that's glittering something that's classic but God don't shed it like that all the time he sends it but there was something in that package we need in order to survive and it was wrapped in human flesh what is it inside that human flesh the blood of Jesus Christ you just want what's on the inside and that's the same thing with Jesus Christ he came to his own in his own received the night that's right he's here this morning we are his we are part of the pride and we reject them we come to church and we fill this presence and we reject them because we don't want it the way he comes in we wanted something classical okay something something with perfume shiny and with flowers but when the Holy Ghost touches one of these days when it really touches oh you begin to cry you begin to win you begin to raise up your hands it's not something classical it's not something pretty that's why we don't want it because we we it makes us react a certain ways so it is today when this great gift of the church the Holy Spirit what's the gift the Holy Spirit it falls upon the poor and the humble guys the rich don't want it they don't want to Humble themselves they want it with classes but they don't want it the way God sends it many people wants to receive the holy ghosts how many you want the Holy Ghost I believe we already have it maybe it might be one or two that don't have it they maybe we want many people want to receive the Holy Ghost personas but they don't want to get it the way they want to get it the way they want it I'm going to say that again many people want to receive the Holy Ghost personas but they want to get it the way they want it all I'm so glad you can't do it that way you have to do it the way God sends it to you you got to humble yourself and receive it many people want to receive the holy ghosts by just coming to church and just dressing real fine and pretty no you've got to come to church got to surrender yourself you got to humble yourself you gotta Surrender Your Ideas you gotta raise up your hands to knock off the starch out of her neck and you got to say God there's nothing that I can do to receive your holy ghosts and I yield myself to you I want to receive the Holy Ghost the way that I'm supposed I don't believe in a dried I repentance okay God I'm sorry thank you Lord oh no when you really receive it and when you truly understand that you're a sinner nothing from foreign how do they receive it in Pentecost they put their differences aside they started to forgive one another all the little disputes they started to fix everything oh what a hard thing that is for everyone to get in one Accord I wonder if that's the reason why we don't have the Holy ghosts aside foreign foreign there's no perfect Church perfecta but I would say this there is a Perfect Bride a bride who's making herself ready amen amen they don't want it it's the same thing today is they don't want it they don't want the Holy Ghost because they know what it's wrapped in it they know what's inside of it they they watch a person receive the Holy Ghost observance they stand there and they see that woman maybe as low as you could be to even the dogs will hardly ever look at her and they see that woman come up to the altar even is to see a woman clean up her life get out and act like a lady see one runs Bridge parties smoke for or five packs of cigarette today hang around the saloons and regular barfully and they know that if they and they know if they accept this gift of God yeah it's wrapped in the package called Jesus Christ every bit of the worldly funds because he won't stand for that it does something to them it changes people don't want to be changed listen leave me alone they don't want the Holy Ghost because they don't want to change they want to be the way they always the way they've always been yeah they say leave NBA John 3 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him so not perish but have everlasting life I found this image the other day is where we see there's two booths we see John 3 16. and we see John 3 16 to 21. and we see a long line on John 3 16. but in the other booth there's nobody there because I believe that John 3 16 is the most misunderstood scripture says you go to the Super Bowls you go to the World Cup any any festival or any big event called Kill Festival or somebody preaching in the streets you see always see John 3 16. but they never read what's after John 3 16. so let's see what it says on the 17th verse for God sent not a son into the world to condemn the world but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that the light has come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil neither one neither cometh to the light shall be reproved or exposed us but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that is these may be manifestos that they are wrought in God begin to see we begin to understand a variant in there that they're no wonder they don't want the other booth because they have the light of the world has come to the world and they they started to see that their deeds even kisses over us they're not good they're evil they're not wrong maybe some greater than others and the light exposes those wrongs but he doesn't come to condemn the world but he comes to save it everyone who wants to be saved everybody who wants to save in their own selves they're going to try to say that they say themselves by works and what that light does it condemns them when we're here at church and you're the fir you're new to coming to church you begin to hear the gospel the light of the gospel and you begin to see that it exposes you that you're wrong and as a human reaction we don't want to accept that we're wrong we always want to say that we're right but everything I do is correct and what I do I can justify it but the gospel of the light exposes it gives you these two paths and we have the right to choose one or the other direction but we go to Ephesians the second chapter on verse we're going to read here on God's gifts here it says for by grace are ye saved this is and there is not of yourself yes but it is a gift of God see it's a gift from God see by grace are you saved through faith and it is not of yourselves so we're saved because God has given us Grace all we have to do is believe in that word we have to believe in this word but Faith but there's Works being expressed through faith I always kisses in other words I just can't say I'm safe just because I believe in God if I truly believe I'm safe by faith me Faith I start showing it by work by my works I can I can fake it after a while but when God is truly inside of my heart I begin to express it I express it by coming to church I express it but when someone does wrong to me I let it go I apologize because it's by faith we start showing it by faith we started showing it how we are in the church from yourself it's a gift it's a gift here it is all you have to do is take it but it seems that no one wants to take the gift of God everybody wants to work for it everybody wants to work hard they want to show everybody that I'm the best hard worker because I'm saved by works it says that is not of works this is for we are his workmanship created in Christ which God had before ordained that we should walk in them it is not by works young and old and all foreign beyond that Dimension they still have a memory they know he's having what they were doing they know what time it is on Earth they know down there it's Christmas time they know what they've done to a Christmas time what if they're creeping bony frame could get back to this church door this morning what do you think they would do if they had an opportunity to come back this morning next Christmas you may be there you may have been you you might you may have been there there a year next Christmas you're dealing with human Souls you're dealing with spiritual things and each one of you has to got to answer at that day of judgment if you haven't received the Christ this morning he stands at the open door of your heart so there is a hell that exists brother Brahm says that they were able to get up and resurrect this is one more opportunity just go and come to the doors of the church says where they just not just raise up their hands oh I I can imagine if someone from hell will just resurrected and said if I had one more opportunity I wouldn't take Church in vain anymore whether it was the most boring preacher the most exciting preachers it doesn't matter because I'm coming to see Christ I'm coming to receive him I'm coming to get my life right if my life isn't right I want to make it right I want to humble myself I want to fix it I don't know where I'm going to be tomorrow what's hindering you this morning what's stopping you this morning so what are you gonna do about it that is what the Holy Ghost will do to you so I asked the question to each and every single one of you this morning have you received the Holy Ghost how do you receive God's gifts if you haven't received it just receive it this morning that's all you gotta do is it might make you cry a little bit he says it might make you just cry a little bit he says that Young Rich ruler began to cry there's nothing else there why do you want to go there it's impossible for man to go to hell it's impossible it's not for you it's a hard thing for a man to go to hell if you got one more opportunity this morning to accept God's gifts you might say well brother I've already received it is you can receive a double portion of the Holy Spirit if you have something in your heart this morning if you've got a burden in your heart if you got something you want to let go this morning Jesus Christ the King of Kings lo siento I I know Jose that I've done wrong but father I want you to please come inside my heart every father I want a double portion of your Holy Spirit Well I don't know where I'm going to be tomorrow father you know I don't know what can happen to me tomorrow but
