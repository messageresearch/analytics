[52:34] we're dust
[52:41] but what makes the difference is the
[52:43] breath of life that you put in us
[52:47] like for example when a child is born
[52:52] if it doesn't even it doesn't make any

[53:47] Christ amen amen
[53:52] just as you are standing we'll be

[53:55] [Music]
[53:57] as everyone knows
[54:03] me and the clock don't get along at all
[54:08] I want to start immediately
[54:12] and pray to the Lord that he helps us
[54:17] that way we can say something that what
[54:19] can help us
[54:24] there's a scripture that I want to read
[54:27] in Isaiah chapter 9 verse 6.
[54:30] yes
[54:45] the book of Isaiah chapter nine
[54:49] boys
[54:51] and I'll start with verse six
[54:55] Gloria Senor and praise the Lord
[55:15] become a habit in our homes
[55:22] before I go to work at 11 or 12 o'clock
[55:25] at night or one in the morning
[55:29] I read 10 verses of one of the books of
[55:31] the Bible
[55:34] and sometimes I get up so late I'm
[55:36] running all over
[55:40] but I sit down and grab the Bible read
[55:42] 10 verses
[55:44] of the book of the Bible
[55:47] may God help us
[55:51] I know that we're in an age where we run
[55:54] so much
[55:55] and we don't progress that much
[55:59] nacido
[56:08] foreign
[56:37] and the government shall be upon his
[56:39] shoulder and his name shall be caught
[56:41] wonderful and counselor and that's where
[56:43] I'll get my title from counselor the
[56:46] Mighty God the Everlasting father the
[56:47] Prince of Peace Brothers
[56:56] this is the main scripture that I want
[56:59] to use
[57:03] and pleaded to the Lord
[57:07] that he has the entire power to cast me
[57:10] to the side
[57:12] may he take the control this morning
[57:15] Sierra
[57:48] a simple spare tire
[57:53] because when we're in a car
[57:58] by God's grace I tell my wife
[58:02] we're gonna put new tires on the
[58:05] [Applause]
[58:06] cars
[58:09] because I drive 10 hours on a daily
[58:12] basis on the streets
[58:16] and there is not a day go by that I
[58:19] don't see a new car
[58:21] or an old
[58:23] Cara that's on the side of the road
[58:27] with the flat tire
[58:29] Hermano
[58:31] siendes and with the 110 degree weather
[58:35] on the outside
[58:36] without a bottle of water
[58:41] what's the first thing that comes to
[58:43] mind when that you see that
[58:46] maybe it's happened to some of you
[58:49] it's happened to myself
[58:54] that's why I tried to put in new tires
[58:57] on my car
[59:00] when I whenever I had the chance I
[59:03] stopped
[59:04] and I offered them a bottle of water
[59:10] and I have with me two gallons of water
[59:12] in my truck yes
[59:15] and sometimes I offer them my two
[59:17] gallons of water
[59:20] and on Friday something happened to my
[59:22] daughter
[59:23] I was on my way home already yeah my
[59:27] wife called me
[59:29] it says your daughter strand ended with
[59:31] the car
[59:32] the air stopped
[59:36] it doesn't want to go anywhere I went
[59:39] over there
[59:41] immediately I thought
[59:46] I'm sure that the radiator doesn't have
[59:48] any water
[59:49] I went over there
[59:52] my daughter was in the car mirror
[59:55] I could see the car and it was already
[59:57] cold
[59:59] it had no water whatsoever
[1:00:02] agua I just filled it with water
[1:00:05] I ran here and ran there
[1:00:09] I sent her to go buy some antifreeze
[1:00:13] but when she came back I already filled
[1:00:16] the car with water
[1:00:17] and I said just uh sweetie turn it on
[1:00:20] she turned it on I turned on the air
[1:00:23] yeah and we started running and she left
[1:00:41] that if we check on them
[1:00:45] we can avoid a big headache
[1:00:49] so this morning my thoughts
[1:00:53] my little subject it's called consejos
[1:00:57] Council a
[1:01:02] Para
[1:02:00] everything that the preacher gives us on
[1:02:03] Wednesday Friday and Sunday are our
[1:02:05] councils of eternal life and those is
[1:02:08] so everything that is preached
[1:02:11] everything that the prophet taught us
[1:02:15] everything that the apostles preached is
[1:02:18] for
[1:02:20] eternal life
[1:02:21] for eternal life
[1:02:24] Council for eternal life is
[1:02:30] eternal life and then parentheses for
[1:02:32] eternal life
[1:02:35] so let's emphasize on the word
[1:02:41] the word for it encloses or involves
[1:02:44] certain things
[1:02:47] and I'll say it right away because time
[1:02:49] is running up from me
[1:02:52] that's if we do them
[1:03:02] that's why I call the councils of
[1:03:05] eternal life because all councils for
[1:03:06] children
[1:03:09] the message is if we read them and if we
[1:03:12] do them
[1:03:14] the messages
[1:03:18] but if we don't do it
[1:03:21] what's the point
[1:03:56] we already know what happened in Libya
[1:04:09] people sleeping in their homes
[1:04:36] how many were ready
[1:04:39] how many were ready
[1:04:42] but that already happened about a week
[1:04:45] ago
[1:04:48] so my question for you today is are you
[1:04:51] ready
[1:04:52] it's a glory to his name
[1:04:55] we're going to bring it closer we're
[1:04:58] going to bring it to ourselves
[1:05:00] for us that are here gathering
[1:05:05] for us that have come to hear the
[1:05:08] council
[1:05:09] because when the minister is preaching
[1:05:27] you don't have to be worried about
[1:05:29] anything
[1:05:36] you cured spots
[1:05:38] but if you come be a scooter and you
[1:05:41] hear
[1:05:42] but then you don't do it
[1:05:56] if we do it
[1:05:59] it's Council of eternal life
[1:06:03] and in parenthesis foreign
[1:06:16] regardless of whatever your age is
[1:06:20] I'm a person that has a lot of age now I
[1:06:24] I don't look like it but I am yeah
[1:06:26] I'm up there in age
[1:06:29] I won't say how much
[1:06:31] because many of you already know how
[1:06:34] much
[1:06:36] but how many of you
[1:06:39] in the age that you have now
[1:06:42] you can remember of some advice
[1:06:45] that your father had given you okay or
[1:06:49] that your mother gave you
[1:06:51] concept
[1:07:34] he three times mentions the word counsel
[1:07:37] VES
[1:07:39] how do you think I felt when I was
[1:07:41] sitting down there
[1:07:43] because that's what the Lord was giving
[1:07:45] me
[1:07:46] because that's what I Was preparing for
[1:07:48] today
[1:07:52] so me sitting down there how do you
[1:07:54] think I fell
[1:07:58] applications
[1:07:59] as I heard the testimony
[1:08:03] where's the brother where is he
[1:08:07] Hermano
[1:08:08] trespasses three times
[1:08:15] that filled me with so much happiness
[1:08:18] and then brother Emmanuel comes
[1:08:22] he reads Hebrews
[1:08:26] she's having around us a great cloud of
[1:08:28] witnesses
[1:08:31] let us run this page
[1:08:35] let us run with patience the race said
[1:08:38] before us
[1:08:41] and I liked what he told us when there's
[1:08:44] a race
[1:08:45] when there's a relay race
[1:08:49] and they're ready
[1:09:48] see that I'm going back and forth
[1:09:51] because I'm fighting for that race
[1:09:54] I love it I cherish it
[1:09:57] for years I've lived in that race
[1:10:01] it I don't want to be eliminated
[1:10:05] when I can see the finish line so close
[1:10:07] up ahead
[1:10:09] and I said if you fog then get up
[1:10:13] help him to get up again
[1:10:16] that's why we're here
[1:10:18] we're brothers in Christ
[1:10:21] let us pick each other up then yeah
[1:10:25] we have very little left
[1:11:24] but he found us in due time
[1:11:45] the brother said when he came up here
[1:11:47] and read it
[1:11:49] he says there's a petition that our
[1:11:51] brother has been waiting for 28 years
[1:12:43] Council of eternal life
[1:12:50] that's if we do it
[1:12:55] now let me give you this scripture
[1:13:00] and it took me about two hours to find
[1:13:02] it
[1:13:06] I have brother Octavius phone number
[1:13:09] I have your phone number
[1:13:12] I could have called you
[1:13:17] or with you I have brother oh videos
[1:13:18] phone number too
[1:13:20] I have many of yours uh phone numbers
[1:13:26] I said no I have to find it on my own
[1:13:31] I know it's a scripture that's in the
[1:13:33] word
[1:13:34] it's in the New Testament it's in the
[1:13:37] Epistles
[1:13:40] on Saturday I got up at five in the
[1:13:42] morning
[1:13:45] it took me two hours just to find this
[1:13:48] scripture
[1:13:49] I didn't want to go to use my phone
[1:13:52] neither did I want to go to the Internet
[1:13:58] neither did I want to use the Scofield
[1:14:00] concordance that the Bible has
[1:14:02] I said no I have to find it
[1:14:07] I have the feeling in my heart that I'm
[1:14:09] going to read it
[1:14:11] I said Lord help my mind
[1:14:14] and I'll guide my fingers
[1:14:24] and twice I went over this book of First
[1:14:27] Corinthians and you can join me in First
[1:14:28] Corinthians
[1:14:30] I passed over 100 or twice
[1:14:34] I read all of Paul's Epistles
[1:14:38] just two hours of just straight reading
[1:14:41] and reading
[1:14:43] and I know how the scripture reads
[1:14:46] that's why I know I wasn't unable to
[1:14:48] find it but
[1:14:49] then all of a sudden I found it they
[1:14:52] said
[1:14:53] corintios
[1:14:56] it's in First Corinthians 10 24.
[1:15:01] you can find it with me
[1:15:04] you don't have to wait the two hours
[1:15:06] that I had to wait
[1:15:08] I'm giving you the scripture right away
[1:15:11] just find it
[1:15:15] because there's a little text it's very
[1:15:17] little but it's very beautiful
[1:15:21] I forgot my water and can someone bring
[1:15:23] me yes
[1:15:24] it says
[1:15:29] it says let no man seek his own
[1:15:32] but every man's another wealth again
[1:15:41] but every man another's wealth
[1:15:55] and I want to get ahead of myself
[1:15:57] because I'm not going to be time
[1:16:00] my brother Rolando said
[1:16:06] he said my grandfather was the pastor of
[1:16:09] the church
[1:16:11] [Music]
[1:16:15] my grandfather was the pastor of the
[1:16:18] church
[1:16:23] then the father my brother is the son of
[1:16:26] his grace
[1:16:29] so they grew up in the message
[1:16:35] may God bless all the young people that
[1:16:37] have grown up in the message
[1:16:40] I want to give you a 10 out of 10 this
[1:16:43] morning
[1:16:46] may God bless the young boys and girls
[1:16:50] that were born in the message Emmanuel
[1:16:57] this morning speaking to brother
[1:16:59] Emmanuel
[1:17:01] I'm not going to mention what we said
[1:17:04] but I was interested
[1:17:07] we were back there alone
[1:17:15] and it's a great privilege to be born in
[1:17:18] a church that already believes in the
[1:17:19] message of the hour
[1:17:20] but let me say something
[1:17:24] though you were born in the message of
[1:17:27] the hour pero muchos de Nosotros but
[1:17:30] many of us
[1:17:34] many of us we we go we go astray from
[1:17:37] the message of the hour
[1:17:39] we knew the message
[1:17:42] we were born in the message
[1:17:45] we would go to church
[1:17:49] but we grew up
[1:17:52] Amigos and the brother mentioned friends
[1:17:55] he mentioned friends
[1:17:59] you know what the Bible says about
[1:18:01] friends

[1:19:22] weakness

[1:19:32] he was he was out puffing out smokes
[1:19:40] he said I'm sorry this is my weakness
[1:19:44] and he started drinking
[1:19:47] and the third one
[1:19:50] you couldn't believe it as well
[1:19:53] he would look at one and look at the
[1:19:55] other yeah
[1:19:57] and they would also look at him
[1:19:59] he says well you're the only one that's
[1:20:01] left
[1:20:03] what's your
[1:20:05] weaknesses
[1:20:12] but since they were insisting so much
[1:20:15] I said being that you're insistence

[1:20:35] are doing
[1:20:37] can you imagine that

[1:21:54] the mother of the little one
[1:22:00] and say brother please pray for my son

[1:24:35] Let's uh do a favor
[1:24:39] we don't ever know when we'll be the one
[1:24:42] that needs
[1:24:44] one time I was coming from a trip from
[1:24:46] Mexico
[1:24:47] it was getting dark
[1:24:51] and I find a man
[1:24:54] a grandfather and his wife
[1:24:58] standing next to the car on the side of
[1:25:00] the road and here I come is
[1:25:06] and I can see that they're behind the
[1:25:08] car looking at the traffic
[1:25:10] I pull over and stop
[1:25:14] and I asked them do you need anything
[1:25:16] this is
[1:25:18] our tire got flat
[1:25:22] he says I said don't worry I'm going to
[1:25:24] help you
[1:25:25] I put my tie over my shoulders
[1:25:29] I still had my suit on
[1:25:33] I got all the tools
[1:25:37] they brought out all they knew that they
[1:25:39] had to bring out
[1:25:41] but they were struggling
[1:25:43] I helped them
[1:25:46] I put their Tire in the back
[1:25:49] and the man came up to me and said
[1:25:53] mister can you please take these twenty
[1:25:56] dollars
[1:25:59] I said sir this favor I did was from all
[1:26:02] my heart
[1:26:04] if I take those twenty dollars
[1:26:08] it would be like a sort of a piece
[1:26:11] and I did it with with all my heart
[1:26:14] I said just keep it to yourself
[1:26:17] and it's a pleasure to have met you
[1:26:21] whenever you can do a favor for someone
[1:26:23] else
[1:26:25] memorize the scripture
[1:26:33] every man another as well
[1:26:39] Council of eternal life
[1:26:41] now when we go to school
[1:26:46] they begin to give us advice
[1:26:50] about what the subject matter of the
[1:26:53] classes
[1:26:56] I mentioned before that I loved history
[1:27:00] I would always get very good grades in
[1:27:03] history
[1:27:06] but when it would come to math I would
[1:27:08] get really poor grades
[1:27:11] I wasn't in my second year and I still
[1:27:14] didn't know
[1:27:15] neither how to subtract nor multiply
[1:27:20] because math math is something that just
[1:27:23] would not call my attention at all
[1:27:29] the teacher would say Juanito I want you
[1:27:31] to stay so you can study math a bit more
[1:27:33] or no no no
[1:27:35] yeah
[1:27:37] I said no no no there's water in the
[1:27:40] river it's coming Downstream I gotta go
[1:27:43] swimming
[1:27:45] now remember on Friday we have to go
[1:27:47] play soccer
[1:27:50] football and that was my three I was a
[1:27:53] player that really liked soccer yes
[1:28:03] you can ask me about Pancho Villa
[1:28:06] [Applause]
[1:28:08] [Music]
[1:28:09] you can just ask
[1:28:17] I love it and enjoy history no
[1:28:51] so I don't know how many of you can
[1:28:54] still remember
[1:28:56] I have a piece of advice your father
[1:28:58] gave you
[1:29:17] [Music]
[1:29:22] I don't know how many can remember that
[1:29:24] but
[1:29:27] there are parents that give counselor
[1:29:29] advice
[1:29:31] and you know what they tried to carry it
[1:29:34] out that's something beautiful
[1:29:37] her brother Louise
[1:29:41] you had a place to go take his wife
[1:29:44] he was concerned
[1:29:49] that he would have a place where he can
[1:29:51] take his wife
[1:29:55] so our parents gave us very good pieces
[1:29:58] of advice
[1:30:00] and we remember them
[1:30:04] it doesn't matter our age if we're 30 40
[1:30:07] 50 or 60.
[1:30:10] if you can open your Bible to First
[1:30:13] Chronicles
[1:30:14] in the Old Testament
[1:30:17] first and second oh sorry
[1:30:19] we in first Chronicles
[1:30:23] it's a scripture that I really love so
[1:30:25] much I really like it

[1:30:41] how many Founders
[1:30:44] did you find it
[1:30:48] look at the beautiful
[1:30:51] it's a father giving advice to his son
[1:30:57] just like our parents would give us
[1:30:59] advice
[1:31:01] advice
[1:31:36] as a servant with the perfect heart
[1:31:41] David knew of his failures
[1:31:47] one day he had to make a choice
[1:31:50] and many died because of the choice he
[1:31:53] made
[1:31:54] he spilled a lot of blood
[1:31:59] that's why the Lord did not allow him to
[1:32:01] build the temple
[1:32:03] because even Nathan didn't know he was a
[1:32:08] prophet he was a prophet
[1:32:11] cuando
[1:32:14] because when David say to Nathan
[1:32:19] Palacio says I live in the palace
[1:32:24] [Applause]
[1:32:38] do all that's according to your heart
[1:32:42] this is because the Lord is with you
[1:32:45] amen amen
[1:32:51] so he says do all and when what that
[1:32:54] means is
[1:32:57] I don't think he was expecting it to
[1:32:59] hear that
[1:33:04] before Nathan left the palace
[1:33:09] to his Prophet is
[1:33:16] just give them these words
[1:33:22] I took you out of your father's
[1:33:24] Sheepfold amen
[1:33:50] and it says for the Lord's churches All
[1:33:53] Hearts
[1:33:57] imagination
[1:33:59] and understand that all the imagination
[1:34:02] of the thoughts
[1:34:05] what we think right now he already knows
[1:34:08] Hermanos you can be sure of that is
[1:34:12] he knows how many hairs we have on our
[1:34:14] head you can say brothers that's God
[1:34:20] he knows how many hairs we have in our
[1:34:22] head
[1:34:27] you know how many hairs fall off of your
[1:34:29] head when you took a shower this morning
[1:34:34] he said brother I don't worry about that
[1:34:35] I don't take a shower
[1:34:37] I don't think I had any hair that fell
[1:34:40] off
[1:34:41] he knows everything

[1:36:31] son
[1:36:34] that should be our Council that we give
[1:36:37] to our sons
[1:36:39] and thou seek Him He will be found
[1:36:42] forsake Him
[1:36:45] He will cast thee off forever
[1:36:50] there is a blessing and there is a curse
[1:36:53] if you do it it's a blessing
[1:36:56] but if you don't do it he has his
[1:36:59] consequences
[1:37:00] now go to the Book of Matthew
[1:37:06] we're going to read one more scripture
[1:37:10] Mateo

[1:43:15] we have to tell you that someone
[1:43:17] they didn't want to stay over the phone
[1:43:19] I bought my plane tickets Via San
[1:43:22] Francisco Rincon I went to San Francisco
[1:43:26] when I get there
[1:43:28] when we go into the office
[1:43:32] and I get together with four or five of
[1:43:34] them it is
[1:43:43] that the time is so close
[1:43:49] that there is no time to get married
[1:43:51] anymore
[1:43:53] and the brothers that are married
[1:43:57] it's no longer time to be spent and they
[1:44:00] no longer have time to spend with them
[1:44:02] I'm not saying that
[1:44:06] I'm just saying the news that they gave
[1:44:08] me
[1:44:09] and it was big news
[1:44:11] and I'm just hearing them
[1:44:16] the young people can no longer get
[1:44:18] married
[1:44:21] and the ones that are married can't
[1:44:23] spend time or their lives anymore why
[1:44:26] is this because the time is now here
[1:44:36] I said Brothers
[1:44:40] that's why you brought me here all the
[1:44:42] way from Denver
[1:44:44] I believe in getting married
[1:44:48] I believe in uh marrying sisters
[1:44:51] if someone wants to get married that's
[1:44:54] fine
[1:44:56] we'll let them get married
[1:44:59] and spending time with our wives it's
[1:45:03] something that's biblical
[1:45:06] we have to live together in cohabits
[1:45:10] Hermanos
[1:45:12] so that those big news really sounded
[1:45:15] weird to me
[1:45:16] I gave them some questions
[1:45:19] I gave them some of Paul scriptures
[1:45:22] and we didn't uh end up being in
[1:45:25] agreement
[1:45:27] and it was the last time that I was
[1:45:29] there for a lot of years
[1:45:31] what is happening
[1:45:34] when we hear something
[1:45:38] what we have to do is stay with the
[1:45:41] words
[1:45:43] give them the word
[1:45:46] give them the scriptures
[1:45:56] if they're not willing to listen to the
[1:45:58] message nor the scriptures
[1:46:01] then we have to separate ourselves
[1:46:04] there's no other way amen amen
[1:46:09] now brother Brandon keeps saying he says
[1:46:12] oh wow
[1:46:14] he says you can see what happens
[1:46:18] just as throw the word down there
[1:46:21] and see where they're at oh this is oh
[1:46:25] wow
[1:46:30] just get right away right then right
[1:46:33] then
[1:47:05] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:47:07] name of Jesus Christ
[1:47:09] for the remission of sins
[1:47:12] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:47:15] Ghost
[1:47:18] the promises to Every Generation
[1:47:22] seed to every generation
[1:47:27] says see that's us
[1:47:31] when he says to every generation
[1:47:34] he says see that's us

[1:47:43] but notice what he says
[1:47:45] he says but it's conditions
[1:47:54] this is foreign
[1:48:10] aren't you happy for that this morning
[1:48:13] glory to his name amen amen they say it
[1:48:17] says
[1:48:18] but it's conditions
[1:48:24] you just can't get it anyway
[1:48:30] he says you've got to follow
[1:48:32] instructions
[1:48:33] now what are instructions Council
[1:49:04] to the coffee place or to his office
[1:49:08] the brother has a chair for himself
[1:49:12] and he has two more chairs
[1:49:15] there he's going to tell us to sit down
[1:49:21] and tell me what is it that I can help
[1:49:23] you with
[1:49:25] we come to ask for it
[1:49:28] that's what we all should do
[1:49:32] whenever we need advice
[1:49:35] whenever we need advice
[1:49:38] amen
[1:49:47] he says but you've got to follow
[1:49:50] instructions
[1:49:56] quickly 1956
[1:50:05] on the 2nd of October yes
[1:50:18] this is now look at the at this little
[1:50:21] story
[1:50:24] read between the lines
[1:50:32] read between the lines amen amen
[1:50:37] read between the lines
[1:50:40] for us today amen amen
[1:50:44] we should read between the lines
[1:50:49] what is it that won't help us
[1:50:52] and if we read between
[1:50:54] you're going to say that's for me
[1:50:56] that piece of advice is for me
[1:50:59] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:51:02] so read between the lines
[1:51:10] where's bear
[1:51:18] says why look at these little children
[1:51:20] going out and making fun of this
[1:51:22] preacher
[1:51:23] that was bald headed
[1:51:26] look what they said to him
[1:51:29] he says go up that bald head like Elijah
[1:51:33] won't you hey
[1:51:36] they didn't believe that Elijah
[1:51:39] they doubted it
[1:51:43] their parents wouldn't believe that
[1:51:47] the preachers of that day didn't believe
[1:51:49] it
[1:51:54] just the wind carried him away and moved
[1:51:56] them somewhere else
[1:52:03] but the the many of the people didn't
[1:52:05] believe that Elijah was carried into
[1:52:07] Heaven by a world
[1:52:08] but I do believe it this morning
[1:52:13] I believe in and I also believe that you
[1:52:16] believe
[1:52:18] Elijah was uh caught away
[1:52:25] glory to his name
[1:52:27] Enoch was translated
[1:52:31] because this is an example of those that
[1:52:33] will be also caught up
[1:52:34] if he allows it amen Brothers
[1:52:41] the random says
[1:52:45] he says how can you expect your children
[1:52:49] here he's speaking to the parents
[1:52:53] how can you inspect your children to be
[1:52:56] just cuando usted
[1:53:00] when you're putting such an example
[1:53:02] before them
[1:53:05] how can you expect to do that
[1:53:10] you're the best example that they have
[1:53:12] Guinness the parents are
[1:53:17] you are the best example that they have
[1:53:20] brothers
[1:53:24] if not they'll look for another example
[1:53:26] outside
[1:53:27] there's friends that they have out there
[1:53:30] there's friends that are out there
[1:53:34] because they think at home
[1:53:37] because you have no time for them let me
[1:53:41] give you some news
[1:53:56] he
[1:54:03] wants to be a prophet
[1:54:17] that shows me that at home he's being
[1:54:20] taught of the Prophet
[1:54:21] sister Marta in Mexico
[1:54:24] there was a little child
[1:54:26] he could barely talk
[1:54:31] and when we got home
[1:54:39] we would ask because we were looking at
[1:54:41] the picture of the Prophet that they had
[1:54:46] and we will tell the little child I
[1:54:48] think his name was Josue we would say
[1:54:51] we would say who is he
[1:54:54] would just stare at it
[1:54:57] the prophet a little guy
[1:55:01] this is the prophet
[1:55:03] he couldn't say Prophet he's the prophet
[1:55:07] amen amen
[1:55:13] but they had that portrait hanging on
[1:55:15] the wall
[1:55:17] foreign
[1:55:37] because his dad was here but
[1:55:40] it was the prophet Brothers
[1:55:43] bet
[1:55:46] the Bible says I won't read it
[1:55:48] train up a child in his way
[1:55:51] and when he grows old
[1:55:55] he will not depart from it
[1:55:59] the devil will come and we'll sift him
[1:56:02] he did it with my children
[1:56:04] he sifted them
[1:56:09] but a father and a mother are praying
[1:56:13] for years and years and years
[1:56:20] and finally they're coming to the feet
[1:56:22] of the Lord
[1:56:25] John Paul's here this morning
[1:56:29] and Jonathan's here right here his wife
[1:56:33] is here
[1:56:34] foreign
[1:57:21] just to hear God's word
[1:57:43] let them serve God
[1:57:45] let them serve God
[1:57:48] and let God decide in the end
[1:58:00] but I told you the story of in McDowell
[1:58:03] about John Curry
[1:58:07] Satan we're coming right down
[1:58:13] Satan will write down all the things you
[1:58:15] did and every so often he comes and he
[1:58:17] blocks
[1:58:18] it says
[1:58:20] this is one of them here's the next one
[1:58:24] yes and when he's about at 10. he says
[1:58:33] you can read me three complete pictures
[1:58:36] but let me tell you something and we
[1:58:39] know he came
[1:58:42] he was born
[1:58:44] and grew up
[1:58:50] the Bible doesn't narrate what he did
[1:58:52] when he was about five six seven eight
[1:58:53] years of age
[1:58:56] but I can assure you he wasn't out with
[1:58:58] stones breaking windows
[1:59:01] he wasn't hitting bunnies
[1:59:12] at the age of 12. foreign
[1:59:35] the water is here
[1:59:39] baptism is for everyone
[1:59:45] from the beginning that your age of
[1:59:48] accountability begins
[1:59:50] but Satan has everything that you did
[1:59:52] written down he also has his own book
[1:59:55] yes
[1:59:56] he knows how to get to you if you drink
[2:00:02] he's going to tempt you with beer yes
[2:00:14] but I think God this morning
[2:00:20] did not smoke no tomorrow neither drink
[2:00:24] neither use curse words
[2:00:27] I have someone
[2:00:30] that told me that I know he didn't do it
[2:00:33] and I believe it with all my heart he
[2:00:36] didn't do it
[2:00:40] that moves my heart
[2:00:47] young people that grew up in the message
[2:00:49] children or parents that were of the
[2:00:50] message
[2:00:52] [Music]
[2:01:28] to so many people that has happened
[2:01:32] and I believe to many other people that
[2:01:34] will happen May God help us this morning
[2:01:37] I wasn't able to finish I'll finish
[2:01:39] something
[2:01:40] but it's Council
[2:01:43] that's if we do it for
[2:01:48] eternal life
[2:01:49] that's if you do it
[2:01:51] tremendous
[2:02:17] when the Devil comes and shows you that
[2:02:19] long sheep a paper of what you've done
[2:02:24] don't get nostalgic
[2:02:27] or sad just think about what he did on
[2:02:30] Calvary
[2:02:33] just think that he paid the price
[2:02:39] now he will give you eternal life
[2:02:43] then you can say you're a liar
[2:02:47] you're a liar
[2:02:51] he already forgave me
[2:02:54] you can show me a list
[2:02:57] he's repeating to me all that I've done
[2:03:00] and yeah
[2:03:02] but he already forgave me
[2:03:05] glory to his name
[2:03:08] still have any doubt
[2:03:11] then this morning you can leave without
[2:03:13] any doubts
[2:03:16] Lord I want to give you my burdens
[2:03:19] I want to leave you everything here
[2:03:23] Lord I love you with all my heart
[2:03:25] Hermanos palabras
[2:03:29] Brothers It's words Council of eternal
[2:03:32] life
[2:03:35] glory to his name
[2:03:38] our heavenly father
[2:03:41] we're here this morning
[2:03:46] hearing your word
[2:03:50] if we do what we hear is
[2:03:53] that sets us on the right path
[2:03:58] that will take us to eternal life
[2:04:03] but if we don't do it
[2:04:09] there's another path that uh so many
[2:04:12] other people are walking in
[2:04:16] they think it's the path to eternal life
[2:04:18] but it isn't
[2:04:20] it so this morning
[2:04:25] Amigo we want to have a friend
[2:04:28] [Music]
[2:04:30] the friends of outside
[2:04:36] so try to drive us to do something bad
[2:04:41] that's why the Bible admonishes and
[2:04:43] tells us and advises us
[2:04:51] if the sinner calls you to do something
[2:04:54] wrong
[2:04:55] don't agree to it
[2:04:57] foreign
[2:05:26] his name is Jesus
[2:05:29] he wants to be your friend

[2:05:39] know he wants to give you an Embrace
[2:05:43] this morning
[2:05:45] a hug of a friend
[2:05:49] when a friend hugs us
[2:05:52] when I'm referring to a church friend
[2:05:56] we feel something in our hearts
[2:05:59] because he's a real friend
[2:06:02] that is hugging us
[2:06:07] our Lord Jesus Christ
