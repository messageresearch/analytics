========================================

and we've been married all several months after about a year Little Billy Paul come on the scene oh she almost died and how I walked up and down the floor when the little fellow was being born and just as soon as he was born I heard him cry and I scream I said Thank You Lord It's a boy and his name shall be call Billy Paul many of you know my son Billy Paul his mother died when he just a little baby and I packed him around and night time we couldn't afford enough coal to keep fire so I'd have put his bottle under my shoulders like this and keep it warm for him at night time when he wake up crying for his mother I'd put the bottle in his mouth and she asked me when she was dying always stick with Billy we've been real Chums and so everywhere I go I take Billy and he's stuck with [Music] me well like could take this opportunity to greet you I don't get this opportunity much anymore as you get a little older you can't do the things that you used to do you want to and in your heart but one thing I want you to know that I love you and I pray for you daily and I know that you pray for me because that's why I'm here today truly we're a blessed people and I just want to take an opportunity to say God bless you and over the many years that I have known you and have worked with you when Dad was here and now in the work with Brother Joseph and it's just an honor to call you my friend and you know there's words you can't say but I just trust that this little greeting will be a blessing to you just to say I love you and that you can feel it from your heart you know brother brand said we could we could talk too much we could sing too much we could shout too much but we could never pray too much and each day brother brandham told me he said when you come in the office Billy he said I want you to do my mail and I said Daddy I don't even know how to turn on the typewriter he says the Lord will be with you he said he told me he wanted you to do that for me and I said okay he said no matter if you've got one letter or you've got a thousand he said the first thing you do is kneel down and pray and lay your hands on the mail and ask the Lord to help you that day and he said don't you answer any Bible questions don't you answer for me he said if there's a question to me you keep them when we get together the next day or that day or whenever he says then you write down on the envelope and I'll answer the questions he said but no matter where I am he says you remember every day that you do the mail he said I'll be praying for you and he says and God will be there with you and he says don't process the mail he said just open one letter at a time and just think like you only have one letter to answer and he says and then when you through with that he says discard it and then get another one and that's what I've been doing for the last 60 years and it's been a great honor and I know I'm getting older now I'm not an old man but I know I'm getting up there and soon I've got to go and be what we've all been waiting for and I believe that R is so close at hand but I just want an opportunity to say I love you and I thank you for your love to me your stand for this word and you know brother Billy I'm just talking to you from my heart I believe this is a oneman message it's a perfect message there's no mistakes there's many voices but for me in my house we only follow one voice and that's the voice of God to us in this day it's perfect it needs no interpretation it interprets itself and I was thinking a couple of days now I'll be getting my 83rd birthday and in my heart and in my body I don't feel that old I know I look at the wife says I act like it no I shouldn't say that if it wasn't for her I I wouldn't even be here today but it's just the idea of of being being able to express yourself this message is everything to me it's perfect and may God encourage your heart to stay with it there's things we don't understand but remember if God thought it brother Brenham spoke it we believe it and that settles it and I was thinking the other day and I woke up and when I was just a little boy I was about 12 years old and we was over in a little town called vandelia Illinois and brother Brandon was having a tent meeting and we stayed in a little cheap hotel and I say that to go with my testimony here and I know you've probably heard me give this testimony but maybe just one more time I want to share it with you because it's one of the greatest experiences of my life and in this room it didn't even have a bathroom the bathroom was down the hall and we just had a war SPAC right where the camera is here and it was just a little war spacing in a little picture and that's where we'd wash our hands and things when we had to take a shower take a bath we go down at the end of the hall I used to sell in the meetings I had a little apron and i' go down and i' sell the little books there was three books brother brandom had Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision Divine Healing in healing in the campaigns and I thought I was something get down there and sell those books and daddy would always and I'd see the the Lord move in the meetings and as a kid he'd tell us about these things and how the angel would meet him and I remember one night in this hotel room we sitting there and my dad's brother was working with us at that time he was driving a truck and his name was Donnie and he was the youngest of the brothers and he and I and dad were sleeping in the same room and I don't remember I know Dad says on tape that he that he took a pillow and throw it over and woke me up all I remember I woke up there was a pillar across my face and and he he had this pillar across my face and he says Paul I said yes sir it was about 2:00 in the morning and he says you know the angel that Daddy talks about I said yes sir and he said he visited me tonight and was telling me some things and about the meetings and how to conduct the meetings and what was going to happen and I said yes sir and he still had the pill across my face and he he says and I asked him could I wake you up and could I wake up my brother Donnie and he said the angel said you can wake up Billy And he says and he says can he see you and the angel said yes he said excuse me he says when Dad when dad takes this pillow from your face he says you know where the wi spacing know is over there and I said yes sir he said he'll be standing there and you can see him and I said okay remember I just 12 years old and he took a pillow from my face and I thought it' be an angel with wings flying around but it wasn't like that there stood a man in that room dressed in Pure White and he had his arms folded like this hair down to his shoulders he just stood there one thing it remind was so outstanding to me he never spoke a word but he look around the room but his eyes was totally focused on my dad every move was watching my dad and I can see those I can see him yet now them eyes just going around the room he look at me and he look over at my Uncle he look back around like that he'd move his head a little bit but his eyes never left Daddy's Eyes and I grabbed daddy cuz I I didn't know it was a man standing in the room over by the window and and he I never forget day told me he says don't be scared son he said he sent from the presence of almighty God and he says he won't harm you he says he'll be a blessing I watching he just held real close and daddy held me and he went from that being of a man just as brother Bram describes him into I'm not going to say a pillar fire it was like a Mist a light a vapor he just kind of vanished and he he went out the window right out the room like that and when he left a rainbow come right in the same window and hung in that room for hours at midnight 2:00 in the morning dark room but he stood there in that pillow excuse me that rainbow stayed in the room I felt a presence and I asked my dad later I says why did that happen and he says he said cuz I wanted you to see him he said God called you to work with me Billy and I wanted you to see him and to know what Daddy was telling you was the truth not that I doubt it but it was just such an experience such a wonderful experience and all through my life I traveled and my job was to get Daddy in and out of the meetings and you know sometimes I let him stay too long and sometimes I'd take him too quick and you know I just young boy but I kept doing what he said and I give out the prayer cards and I'd bring the people up to him and sometimes I let him stay too long and he'd say Billy you let me stay too long tonight he says he says tomorrow night you don't give out prayer calls CU Dad's too t why i' to go home and I'd cry I'd be so upset cuz I messed up the next night's meeting then sometimes I take him too quick and he'd say you could let me stay a little longer no it was just a hard time but what a wonderful time I've seen the people just any disease I was thinking the other night you know you watch the news they call this disase that and they they change the name but it's all the devil it's all the devil but when the angel met him he said if you get to people to believe you nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer and I'm a witness to you today that he's the same yesterday today and forever and what not one time from that time in that room when I saw that angel that I could always tell you not brother Bill but that presence I could tell when he was near even before daddy would say you know what I'm waiting for something I might be down the audience working the prayer line ushering whatever I might be doing but I could tell exactly when that angel come to the platform before dad sometimes even said he said he's here I knew he was so didn't make a difference what diseases was I knew when they left is going to be well but he said if you get the people to believe you and I was telling someone the other day I said I've seen him bring them in well and they sit there and make fun and they pack them out dead I seen them pack them out paralyzed and I seen them bring them in on a stretcher and they would be dead and I seen them walk out alive and well only believe so I just wanted to say God bless you and I like to just leave my little greetings to you and this if I don't see you in person I'll meet you on that day and I had the privilege when he was here to have the interviews for him to set him up I don't know how it's going to be over there I just know I'm going to be there by his grace and I said God Bless Me Above any man first of all he let me be his son he chose me and then he let me be a son of a prophet and to be a brother of a prophet and to have worked with both of the prophets my lifetime truly I've been a blessed man all we have to do is push play and obey God bless you and remember if God thought it brother Bram spoke it I believe it and that settles it God bless [Music] you
