[1:02:00] the series
[1:02:02] and as we said we're going to title it
[1:02:04] the marriage covenant
[1:02:10] we thank everyone who has been coming
[1:02:11] and has been listening
[1:02:15] to all the young people that's been
[1:02:16] watching and listening to us
[1:02:18] holiness
[1:02:20] and uh we hope that it's a blessing who
[1:02:22] has been a blessing to every single one
[1:02:24] of you
[1:02:27] and here we're we're reaching the climax
[1:02:30] of our messages
[1:02:34] we're probably living out a lot of
[1:02:36] things
[1:02:39] and things that you probably are
[1:02:40] thinking in your mind that we've left
[1:02:42] out
[1:02:46] but if you have any questions or you
[1:02:48] have anything in your mind
[1:02:51] feel free to prefer to talk to us
[1:02:56] we don't want to leave anything out what
[1:02:57] the prophet brought no queremos de
[1:02:58] carnada fuera de los
[1:03:00] we
[1:03:01] even though we have a good opinion
[1:03:05] but if that a good opinion is not
[1:03:06] aligned with the word
[1:03:08] opinion
[1:03:10] i don't want that good opinion
[1:03:13] i want what the word of god says
[1:03:16] the word of god might hurt me
[1:03:19] it might cut me
[1:03:21] but i know that it's going to give me
[1:03:22] life
[1:03:25] just like if you're in the hospital
[1:03:28] and you're you're cutting you're
[1:03:29] bleeding and you got an accident
[1:03:35] like you've been caught up by life
[1:03:38] you've been damaged by life
[1:03:40] but you're there in the hospital
[1:03:43] the doctor sometimes he's kind of has to
[1:03:45] poke you just a little bit and get the
[1:03:47] injection in
[1:03:51] just to make you feel better
[1:03:54] so the so the cells can start working
[1:03:56] but
[1:04:12] but my soul
[1:04:13] me alma that's what matters is look
[1:04:16] important it's my soul it's me alma amen
[1:04:18] amen i hope you love me
[1:04:21] and if you love the lord eventually
[1:04:22] you'll love me when it is
[1:04:26] amen
[1:04:27] so so here we want we were speaking
[1:04:30] about courtship and marriage accustomed
[1:04:34] and we want
[1:04:36] everyone and we want the young people to
[1:04:38] have a successful marriage
[1:04:43] and we're responsible for that
[1:04:46] everything what the prophet brought toda
[1:04:50] we are obligated obligatory to preach
[1:04:52] what he brought the predicate
[1:04:55] i'm going to say that again
[1:04:57] whatever what the prophet brought
[1:04:59] william mary and branham william marion
[1:05:01] brown every single tape that he preached
[1:05:05] as ministers
[1:05:34] i want you i hope that you can
[1:05:35] understand
[1:05:37] that we're not saying this to kill
[1:05:39] anyone
[1:05:43] but as ministers
[1:05:45] are obligated to preach to to the
[1:05:47] bribery
[1:06:14] we're responsible to preach what what
[1:06:16] the prophet
[1:06:20] amen amen and we we want to speak on the
[1:06:23] covenant today
[1:06:26] the definition of the covenant
[1:06:28] it's a formal or serious agreement or
[1:06:31] promise
[1:06:36] something that you heard throughout the
[1:06:37] scriptures
[1:06:41] abraham god made a covenant with abraham
[1:06:55] amen now marriage belongs to the house
[1:06:59] of god
[1:07:03] it doesn't belong to the courthouse
[1:07:06] now if you get get married to the court
[1:07:08] that's something that we need to do
[1:07:12] but you have to get married in the house
[1:07:14] of god
[1:07:17] if i'm not sure if the brothers in the
[1:07:18] back they still have that pyramid
[1:07:22] i i wonder if they can please put that
[1:07:24] up for me whenever they have a chance
[1:07:32] [Music]
[1:07:35] something that we've already spoke of
[1:07:36] all of these subjects
[1:07:39] the first one is friendship
[1:07:43] superficial and then there's a form of
[1:07:44] friendship superficial formal we talked
[1:07:47] about courtship
[1:07:49] when they're dating
[1:07:52] and then the third one it's confession
[1:07:55] the fourth one the word of promise or
[1:07:57] the engagement
[1:08:00] the wedding ceremony
[1:08:03] there's there there has to be a waiting
[1:08:05] ceremony
[1:08:06] where there has to be a couple of guests
[1:08:18] then we have the wedding supper hello
[1:08:22] the
[1:08:22] honeymoon brother bernie has always told
[1:08:25] us that there should be a honeymoon
[1:08:29] all of that's what i'm saying
[1:08:31] it types the spiritual
[1:08:34] spiritual with christ
[1:08:36] there is going to be there is a waiting
[1:08:37] ceremony
[1:08:38] there is a waiting supper
[1:08:40] there is a honeymoon
[1:08:43] brother bernie says you should at least
[1:08:44] go out for a weekend
[1:08:49] three days at least
[1:09:04] then we have what is the bedroom
[1:09:09] there is where the the the marriage
[1:09:13] is consummated
[1:09:15] that's where it's it's finished
[1:09:19] amen amen
[1:09:21] so we're going to read all of that back
[1:09:22] it up with the word
[1:09:26] and now as we said one of the first
[1:09:27] times we we were here
[1:09:31] there's a lot of people that want to
[1:09:32] flip that pyramid
[1:09:36] they want to start from the end and end
[1:09:38] up in the last
[1:09:40] term
[1:09:41] but we want we want to have a successful
[1:09:43] marriage
[1:09:45] we want to we want we want christ in our
[1:09:47] marriage
[1:09:49] we recommend the young people to get to
[1:09:52] have the new birth
[1:09:56] we preach it until we get so exhausted
[1:10:07] there's only a very rare amount of
[1:10:09] people that actually do it
[1:10:21] and the holy spirit that's in him
[1:10:23] that's going to tell him his post of
[1:10:25] duty
[1:10:27] the holy spirit inside of her el
[1:10:28] espiritu
[1:10:34] and the first few months start to roll
[1:10:37] and you start noticing that he's not
[1:10:39] doing his job
[1:10:42] you don't have to be barking at them
[1:10:44] look you got to do this you got to do
[1:10:46] this
[1:10:48] or vice versa you got a woman you got to
[1:10:50] do this
[1:10:53] holy spirit that's already in them
[1:11:06] that's why we need to be born again
[1:11:08] foreign
[1:11:12] are gonna start going away
[1:11:14] because he knows what he has to do el
[1:11:16] salvador
[1:11:17] she knows what he has
[1:11:19] but if you just get married just because
[1:11:21] you just are blindly in love with one
[1:11:23] another
[1:11:26] one of these days you're going to find
[1:11:28] yourself with a hard spot
[1:11:31] better to have the new birth
[1:11:35] before you get married
[1:11:37] amen amen
[1:11:39] but the ram says this is about the
[1:11:40] bedroom element
[1:11:44] after what the marriage is to consummate
[1:11:46] the marriage
[1:11:48] there then in the next place you enter
[1:11:50] in the kind of a relationship of this
[1:11:51] type logon
[1:11:59] you stand there maybe in the parlor and
[1:12:01] she's taking her off her veil
[1:12:06] and you put your arms around her and you
[1:12:08] tell her you love her
[1:12:12] and what she's going to be the most
[1:12:13] darling wife in all the world
[1:12:17] and how that you love her and how you're
[1:12:19] going to be loyal to your to your
[1:12:20] marriage vows and so forth
[1:12:27] you've done and had your little feast
[1:12:28] the wedding feast
[1:12:32] now you've entered in and you tell her
[1:12:34] in the parlor
[1:12:38] which is like a living room
[1:12:41] you set her down in the chair you set
[1:12:43] her on your lap
[1:12:46] and you tell her you're you're ready to
[1:12:49] enter into real fellowship
[1:12:55] brother ram says excuse me for this rude
[1:12:57] expression
[1:12:59] expression
[1:13:00] but it's not complete yet but
[1:13:16] you can completely fellowship with this
[1:13:19] wife as your wife
[1:13:26] she's never become a complete fellowship
[1:13:27] until she's abide in relationship a
[1:13:43] we're going to go to proverbs 18 verse
[1:13:46] 22.
[1:13:50] it says whoso findeth a wife
[1:13:53] findeth a good thing
[1:13:55] and obtaining favor of the lord
[1:14:03] i want to read that again i hope that
[1:14:05] maybe some of you can find a revelation
[1:14:07] here
[1:14:11] a wife
[1:15:06] she should be so deep hidden in christ
[1:15:12] in christ
[1:15:14] but that man
[1:15:16] has to come into christ
[1:15:19] in order to find him
[1:15:21] a man amen
[1:15:23] i'm going to say that again
[1:15:25] that young lady should be so hidden in
[1:15:27] christ
[1:15:32] that young man
[1:15:34] the only way he can find her comment
[1:16:03] the scripture says then he has favor of
[1:16:05] the lord it is
[1:16:09] amen let's go to ephesians chapter five
[1:16:14] it's a scripture that we've all
[1:16:16] known very well
[1:16:23] and this is a type of scripture where we
[1:16:26] hope we can get some revelation out of
[1:16:27] it
[1:16:32] usually when when we read the scripture
[1:16:36] there's always that one brother
[1:16:40] [Music]
[1:16:43] he never says amen
[1:16:45] but as soon as the minister
[1:16:53] [Music]
[1:17:11] [Music]
[1:17:13] says why submit yourselves onto your
[1:17:15] husbands as on to the lord
[1:17:22] so when you're there's a single young
[1:17:23] lady
[1:17:26] her lord is the lord jesus christ
[1:17:30] he submitted on to the lord jesus christ
[1:17:36] now it says submit yourselves on to your
[1:17:38] husbands
[1:17:42] for the husband is the head of the wife
[1:17:46] even as christ is the head of the church
[1:17:51] he is the savior of the body yes
[1:17:55] therefore as the church is subject onto
[1:17:57] christ
[1:18:01] so let the wives be to their own
[1:18:02] husbands and everything
[1:18:09] husbands
[1:18:23] knew what the church did
[1:18:26] the church kicked out jesus christ
[1:18:30] he kicked him out of his own house
[1:18:34] and he still gave himself for it
[1:18:38] how many can say you meant to do that
[1:18:43] so he says husbands love your wives
[1:18:47] christ never pointed the finger to the
[1:18:49] wife
[1:18:52] yeah you see that you see over there
[1:18:54] he loved her no la and he gave him so
[1:18:57] far he said
[1:18:59] that's how a man should be foreign
[1:19:03] amen
[1:19:04] now i'm going to say something here
[1:19:09] i i believe that with all of my heart
[1:19:13] if there's a minister usher deacon
[1:19:18] musician song musical director
[1:19:32] and if he treats her like a doormat is
[1:20:16] how
[1:20:29] what makes you think if you don't even
[1:20:31] love your wife
[1:20:33] but if she doesn't even cook for you
[1:20:36] because she did something wrong
[1:20:38] you want to start yelling at her
[1:20:40] but you want to say hey man brothers you
[1:20:41] ready for service
[1:20:44] may
[1:20:58] should
[1:21:02] i i i hope you can see my heart
[1:21:04] especially
[1:21:06] and he says that verse 26 that he may
[1:21:08] sanctify and cleanse it with the washing
[1:21:10] of the water by the word
[1:21:12] he says
[1:21:17] that he may present it to himself as a
[1:21:19] glorious church
[1:21:24] not having a spot
[1:21:26] on
[1:21:26] not
[1:21:56] even as the lord even as the lord the
[1:21:58] church como christo
[1:22:00] for we are members of his body
[1:22:04] of his bones
[1:22:06] for this cause shall a man leave his
[1:22:08] father and mother and shall be joined
[1:22:10] onto his wife
[1:22:15] and they shall be they they too shall be
[1:22:17] one flesh
[1:22:20] this is a great mystery
[1:22:23] but i speak concerning christ and the
[1:22:25] church
[1:22:28] paul says this is a great mystery pablo
[1:22:30] he says
[1:22:32] but we understand
[1:22:34] that every mystery
[1:22:36] has already
[1:23:18] responsible
[1:23:27] amen amen you love god's word
[1:23:30] hey man let's go to genesis 24. mama
[1:23:34] here's where we left off with with isaac
[1:23:36] and rebecca
[1:23:38] rebecca where the servant finished
[1:23:40] talking to her family
[1:23:45] and they they took off to go see isaac
[1:23:50] it says and rebecca arose in her damsels
[1:23:52] and they rode upon the camels and
[1:23:53] followed the man and the servant took
[1:23:55] rebecca and went his way
[1:23:58] rebecca is
[1:24:06] and isaac came from the way of the whale
[1:24:08] of lahai roy for he dwelt in the south
[1:24:10] country
[1:24:11] evening
[1:24:18] and isaac went out to mediate
[1:24:20] in the field at the even tide and he
[1:24:22] lifted up his eyes and he saw and behold
[1:24:24] the camels were coming
[1:24:35] rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she
[1:24:37] saw isaac she lighted off the camel
[1:24:44] for she had for she had said unto the
[1:24:46] servant what man is that walketh in the
[1:24:49] field to meet us
[1:24:51] and the servant said it is my master
[1:24:54] therefore she took a veil and covered
[1:24:56] herself
[1:25:09] and the servant told isaac all the
[1:25:11] things that he had done entonces
[1:25:17] let's read what brother branham has to
[1:25:18] say here
[1:25:20] this this is where we took where we we
[1:25:22] ended on friday
[1:25:24] he says but
[1:25:37] that's when the bride takes the
[1:25:38] bridegroom's name yes
[1:25:42] she's no more than her she's no more
[1:25:44] than of her own name
[1:25:48] she takes the bridegroom's name
[1:25:52] and then when the church has a ceremony
[1:25:54] makes their promises
[1:25:58] then she takes the bridegroom's name
[1:26:02] then she's no longer a church of the
[1:26:07] del mundo world is a church of the lord
[1:26:08] jesus christ
[1:26:11] i don't mean that by name i mean that by
[1:26:14] birth by nature by the power of god
[1:26:20] by the review truth truth of god in the
[1:26:23] heart
[1:26:28] she becomes a christian church
[1:26:31] christian the great universal apostolic
[1:26:33] christian church
[1:26:34] iglesia christian apostolic universal
[1:26:36] she becomes a part of christ
[1:26:39] now christ injects enter into her his
[1:26:42] own spirit his own life christo
[1:26:47] spirit
[1:26:48] and the bible said to adam and eve there
[1:26:50] you are no longer twain but one.
[1:26:56] and and when the woman the church is
[1:26:58] married to christ are no longer two they
[1:27:00] are one
[1:27:09] his life has been brought into you then
[1:27:12] you become the bride
[1:27:17] another thing after she has taken all
[1:27:19] these vowels and so forth and the
[1:27:21] ceremony has been said
[1:27:28] like my wife's name was broy before she
[1:27:30] was married
[1:27:35] now she's no longer broy she's brenham
[1:27:39] yes branham now she is a no more boy
[1:27:41] she's branham yeah
[1:27:43] as brad when she come into christ you're
[1:27:45] known you're no more of the world you're
[1:27:48] of christ
[1:27:52] you care not
[1:27:54] then to the things of the world
[1:27:58] they
[1:28:26] is
[1:28:39] but that husband has to die
[1:28:42] we have to be born again
[1:28:44] and get married to christ
[1:28:47] now that that husband our flesh
[1:28:49] is dead
[1:28:51] so when that husband does nothing no
[1:28:54] longer has a voice anymore
[1:29:06] amen here in the wedding ceremony
[1:29:10] there are some main things or objects
[1:29:12] that we need
[1:29:16] you know i know a lot of people they
[1:29:17] have these traditions
[1:29:21] brother bernie says when a young lady
[1:29:22] wants to get married
[1:29:26] that's her day
[1:29:28] what she wants to do
[1:29:30] what she wants to do let's look at it
[1:29:32] but there are there are certain objects
[1:29:34] that there needs to be in the wedding
[1:29:50] who has the most big wedding
[1:29:55] who is the most flashy one
[1:29:58] who pay for the most
[1:30:00] how to do this and that and the other
[1:30:01] day
[1:30:03] we should never forget what the actual
[1:30:06] meaning of it
[1:30:07] would be
[1:30:10] ceremony is a type of christ
[1:30:15] we're witnessing that ceremony
[1:30:22] one of the things that she needs is her
[1:30:24] dress
[1:30:27] because the bride of jesus christ
[1:30:30] she is getting her dress ready
[1:30:36] it's usually a white dress that means
[1:30:38] purity normal
[1:30:40] blanco significa
[1:30:43] types the holy spirit
[1:30:46] then
[1:30:53] where people wear it to show the people
[1:30:55] outside that they're married
[1:31:00] back in the old times they used to have
[1:31:02] like a
[1:31:03] a bracelet that was a thing around their
[1:31:05] head
[1:31:10] and it had certain diamonds
[1:31:14] and if they lose on those diamonds they
[1:31:15] meant they lost virtue
[1:31:20] but now we have the wedding ring
[1:31:23] and it means something significant
[1:31:26] it's usually it's it's a circle
[1:31:29] circle where it has no beginning and it
[1:31:31] has no end
[1:31:32] principle
[1:31:34] nowadays they have people have what they
[1:31:36] want white gold or gold
[1:31:42] but it really truly
[1:32:24] then we have the veil
[1:32:28] where where the bride she comes down the
[1:32:31] aisle
[1:32:34] usually she comes with her with her
[1:32:35] father normal
[1:32:38] because that's her head
[1:32:41] rather that's the head that's in charge
[1:32:42] of her yes
[1:32:45] and the responsibility of that head
[1:32:49] is that he or that rather that she will
[1:32:51] find her actual head
[1:32:55] his responsibility
[1:32:58] is that she will find her head okay
[1:33:00] she's in charge of her
[1:33:02] car when i walk down the aisle
[1:33:07] she's walking down with her with her
[1:33:08] veil on about
[1:33:11] i've been in weddings
[1:33:13] i think i've heard even brother bernie
[1:33:14] do it before
[1:33:17] when the young lady is walking down the
[1:33:18] aisle
[1:34:14] let's go to isaiah 22.
[1:34:19] [Music]
[1:34:20] and it says i will clothe him with thy
[1:34:22] robe and strengthen him with my with thy
[1:34:23] girdle and i will commit thy government
[1:34:26] unto his hand and he shall be a father
[1:34:28] to the inhabitants of jerusalem and to
[1:34:30] the house of judah
[1:34:41] jerusalem
[1:34:44] and the key of the house of david will
[1:34:45] lay upon his shoulder so he shall open
[1:34:48] and none shall shut and he shall shut
[1:34:50] and none shall open
[1:34:59] for unto us a in is born unto us is
[1:35:01] given the government shall be upon his
[1:35:03] shoulder and his name shall be called
[1:35:05] wonderful counselor the mighty god the
[1:35:07] everlasting father the prince of peace
[1:35:11] is
[1:35:26] he that hath the key of david this
[1:35:28] beautiful phrase follows come comes out
[1:35:30] of the preceding phrase he that is true
[1:35:40] christ the perfect realization
[1:35:42] contrasted with personal realization
[1:35:49] here it is moses was a prophet of god
[1:35:52] but jesus like unto moses was the
[1:35:55] prophet of god
[1:36:03] david a man after god's own heart was a
[1:36:05] king of israel but jesus is the is the
[1:36:07] greater david king of kings the lord of
[1:36:10] lords god very good very god
[1:36:15] israel jesus
[1:36:22] now david was born out of the tribe of
[1:36:24] judah out of whom no priest came yet he
[1:36:26] ate of the shoe bread was reserved for
[1:36:29] priests
[1:36:36] de la
[1:36:40] he was the great warrior overcoming the
[1:36:42] enemy establishing the people as the
[1:36:44] king as king he said on the throne he
[1:36:47] was a prophet el fuel gran guerrero
[1:36:49] venciondo en amigo establa
[1:36:54] he was a wonderful type of christ now it
[1:36:56] says in isaiah 22 22 and the key of the
[1:36:59] house of david will lay upon his
[1:37:01] shoulder so he shall open and none shall
[1:37:04] shut
[1:37:19] the spirit used the spirit uses old
[1:37:21] testament reference concerning the lord
[1:37:23] jesus christ and his ministry in the
[1:37:25] church
[1:37:32] what the key of david signified at the
[1:37:34] time is a mere shadow which now
[1:37:36] fulfilled is jesus standing in the midst
[1:37:38] of the lampstands
[1:37:42] is
[1:37:51] it has to do with our lord after his
[1:37:53] resurrection and not his earthly
[1:37:56] pilgrimage but what what does this key
[1:37:58] signify
[1:38:13] the answer lies in the position
[1:38:16] of the key
[1:38:18] in a position
[1:38:20] it's not in his hand
[1:38:22] it is not worn around his neck
[1:38:25] it's not placed in the hands of an of
[1:38:27] other men
[1:38:30] or the verse could not be saying that he
[1:38:32] alone has the use of that king
[1:38:40] for he alone opens and shuts and no man
[1:38:42] has the right but jesus himself
[1:38:49] jesus but the ramp says isn't that right
[1:38:51] madonna brahms
[1:38:53] but where is the key
[1:38:56] it's on his shoulder
[1:38:58] but what does a shoulder have to do with
[1:39:00] it
[1:39:02] read isaiah 9 6.
[1:39:05] and the government shall be upon his
[1:39:06] shoulders
[1:39:08] what is that what does that mean
[1:39:23] when the bride has been committed
[1:39:30] and places it on the groom's shoulders
[1:39:34] signifying that not only is she under
[1:39:37] her
[1:39:37] his dominion significa
[1:39:47] but also that he bears the
[1:39:49] responsibility
[1:39:52] responsibility
[1:40:25] decree exactly who will be in his bride
[1:40:34] he knew who was going to be in his bride
[1:40:35] elsa
[1:40:37] he chose her ella elizio she did not
[1:40:40] choose him
[1:40:41] he called her ella
[1:40:44] she did not come over on her own
[1:40:46] solar he died for her el morio
[1:41:01] and he accepts the obligation
[1:42:12] when god
[1:42:54] i want
[1:43:36] no
[1:43:50] he'll come in once a year
[1:43:52] to have sacrificed for himself and for
[1:43:54] the people
[1:43:57] but then here came the ultimate
[1:43:58] sacrifice jesus christ
[1:44:03] he came
[1:44:16] the birds and the animals were just sad
[1:44:18] because they they crucify the savior of
[1:44:20] the world
[1:44:24] el salvador
[1:44:27] and the veil was ran into
[1:44:31] it was ripped
[1:45:48] how can you come in the presence of god
[1:45:49] when you don't even love your own
[1:45:51] husband
[1:45:55] i hope you still love me
[1:46:36] right after the young lady comes down
[1:46:37] the altar with her husband
[1:47:14] and the face of this company we joined
[1:47:15] together this man and this woman holy
[1:47:17] matrimony
[1:47:32] is therefore not it is therefore not by
[1:47:35] any to be entered on into this
[1:47:37] unadvisably or lightly

[1:47:44] first message
[1:47:48] we broke down the definition of the
[1:47:49] words

[2:21:56] [Music]
[2:22:00] a few announcements before we're
[2:22:02] dismissed
[2:22:07] how'd you uh like the the series we just
[2:22:10] heard
[2:22:12] amen
[2:22:14] we wanted to put that series together
[2:22:21] and that will be easier to find
[2:22:24] this
[2:22:25] facility
[2:22:27] maybe one day we can put it on our
[2:22:29] website as a series
[2:22:35] and uh we wanted to make sure brother
[2:22:38] luis had the all the liberty liberty to
[2:22:42] speak his
[2:22:43] his mind
[2:22:46] is
[2:22:50] and i agree with everything that he said
[2:22:55] i think it will help our youth in the
[2:22:57] future
[2:23:01] even the married couples
[2:23:30] and uh
[2:23:32] i have to uh
[2:23:34] make a decision
[2:23:38] see the covet has gone down quite a bit
[2:23:44] and if you look around look at the
[2:23:46] numbers
[2:23:51] has gone down
[2:23:52] quite a bit
[2:23:58] now we have all kinds of information
[2:24:00] from everyone
[2:24:03] different information the government's
[2:24:06] been pretty good as to give us uh
[2:24:11] misinformation
[2:24:25] they'll tell us we need one shot two
[2:24:27] shots three shots
[2:24:31] so they've been pretty good at creating
[2:24:33] a confusion
[2:24:38] but i think that our mass should be
[2:24:40] optional
[2:25:03] and if you want to talk about it we're
[2:25:05] going to sit down and talk about it
[2:25:22] i have to keep
[2:25:24] trying to think ahead
[2:25:32] we have to wonder what's next
[2:25:36] what would the government do next
[2:25:41] we know who runs the government right
[2:25:45] now we don't have any doubt who runs the
[2:25:47] government
[2:26:03] we may lose communication or electricity
[2:26:06] soon
[2:26:08] communication or electricity
[2:26:11] if we do
[2:26:13] so
[2:26:14] we'll meet here
[2:26:17] we'll still have services one way or the
[2:26:19] other
[2:26:22] if that ever happens
[2:26:26] okay
[2:26:27] could be next week
[2:26:30] could be a year from now
[2:26:32] on
[2:26:40] we're having an issue with the truck
[2:26:43] trucks
[2:26:48] they're
[2:26:50] they're not delivering products like
[2:26:51] they should
[2:26:55] so my suggestion to you
[2:27:00] is uh make sure you have plenty of food
[2:27:06] maybe they'll shut down the truckers
[2:27:12] or maybe they won't do
[2:27:15] but anything
[2:27:15] think it's a good idea just to make sure
[2:27:17] you have plenty of food at home
