[55:53] my title this morning
[55:57] is the division of christ brings the
[55:59] bride
[56:07] neither pray i for these alone but for
[56:10] them which also
[56:11] which shall believe on me through their
[56:14] word

[56:28] that they may be one as thou father art
[56:31] and me
[56:31] and i and thee they also be one in us
[56:35] that the world may believe that thou has
[56:37] sent me
[56:47] and the glory which thou has gave us me
[56:50] i have given them that they may be one
[56:53] even as we are one
[56:55] la gloria que medici yo le cedado
[57:02] i in them and thou in me that they may
[57:05] be perfect in one
[57:07] and that the world may know that thou
[57:09] has sent me and has loved them
[57:11] and now has loved me
[57:24] [Music]
[57:31] lord we just want to thank you father

[57:35] lord
[57:37] [Music]
[57:39] we thank you for another day of life
[57:44] we thank you father for giving us the
[57:46] revelation of a prophet father
[57:52] lord that you've given us a complete
[57:54] redemption through the blood of jesus
[57:56] christ
[58:01] lord we come here fellowshipped under
[58:03] your holy spirit this morning
[58:09] lord that you may be the one in control
[58:11] of this service father
[58:16] that you may touch each and every
[58:17] expecting heart that is here
[58:19] thirsting for your word thirsting
[58:34] father you're the one that gives us life
[58:37] and you're the one that takes it away
[58:42] so lord we put our hands we put our
[58:45] lives into your hands father this
[58:48] morning
[58:51] we give it all unto thee
[58:54] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[58:56] pray
[58:59] amen and amen amen yemen amen you may be
[59:02] seated
[59:06] god bless each and every one of you
[59:10] as i said my title is the division of
[59:13] christ
[59:14] brings the bride commodity
[59:27] god brings fellowship different than
[59:29] what we think fellowship should be
[59:32] companies
[59:39] it's by one spirit especially we are all
[59:41] united together
[59:44] brother
[59:58] and i wonder about then if we go back to
[1:00:01] the beginning
[1:00:05] you want to know a problem today
[1:00:10] or you want to know something today ok
[1:00:13] something that is happening today in
[1:00:15] this day and age
[1:00:18] you want to see something that has
[1:00:20] happened in the new testament
[1:00:25] you can always find it in the beginning
[1:00:29] everything that is happening now
[1:00:33] has happened in the beginning brother
[1:00:36] branham called that
[1:00:37] uh genesis a seed chapter in the
[1:00:39] monobram yama libra de genesis
[1:00:42] because it's the beginning of all things
[1:00:46] it's the beginning of true fellowship
[1:00:51] and in genesis it's the beginning of
[1:00:53] false
[1:00:55] of fellowships it's the beginning of
[1:00:58] god's
[1:00:58] outpouring of his spirit
[1:01:03] and it's the beginning of satan's reign
[1:01:05] on the earth
[1:01:10] said there's two books in the bible that
[1:01:13] satan hates
[1:01:14] this element
[1:01:18] one is revelations because it shows his
[1:01:22] end pokemon
[1:01:35] and if we look in the beginning
[1:01:39] we can have a clear view of what's
[1:01:41] happening now
[1:01:44] so brother branham says all things began
[1:01:47] in genesis
[1:01:51] and in genesis we find out that god
[1:01:53] created
[1:01:54] man for his fellowship
[1:02:01] it kind of sounds like i'm beating a
[1:02:02] dead horse here perez
[1:02:17] he created the angels to worship him el
[1:02:19] creole los angeles
[1:02:21] but he created a man a special a
[1:02:25] position
[1:02:29] to be sons and daughters of god
[1:02:33] to have a special fellowship with him
[1:02:38] that an angel can never have like
[1:02:42] that no other being no other beast on
[1:02:44] the earth can ever have this
[1:02:46] special gift a man and a woman
[1:02:55] it's to be one in one with god
[1:02:59] and how does god achieve this fellowship
[1:03:04] we know brother branham says god doesn't
[1:03:06] have grandchildren
[1:03:10] that means we just don't come to church
[1:03:35] because it's become a personal
[1:03:38] revelation to
[1:03:39] each and every person
[1:03:42] personally it's not because my daddy
[1:03:45] went to church
[1:03:48] it's not because my family lied we've
[1:03:50] done this for
[1:03:51] so many ages
[1:03:55] but it's a personal relationship with
[1:03:58] god
[1:04:02] so god desires fellowship
[1:04:07] not through a system no pornerio de un
[1:04:09] systema not through a church
[1:04:16] and whenever god achieves that
[1:04:18] fellowship in you and i
[1:04:19] e lo grace companies
[1:04:23] then there's perfect fellowship with you
[1:04:24] and i entonces existed
[1:04:27] when i talked to my brother when i
[1:04:30] talked to my
[1:04:31] sister when i talked to somebody
[1:04:35] i'm talking to god that's why whenever
[1:04:39] we know that we have the holy spirit
[1:04:44] and there's people out there dying
[1:04:49] dying for the word of the lord
[1:05:15] he could have the revelation that jesus
[1:05:18] christ
[1:05:18] is represented in that manner
[1:05:28] just like that child whenever he was
[1:05:29] scared of the thunderings
[1:05:33] and his mama said it's just
[1:05:38] we're christians we know you know that
[1:05:40] god is with you all the time
[1:05:45] the kid's like yes yes i know that mama
[1:05:47] el nino di jose
[1:05:50] but sometimes i just want god with skin
[1:05:54] on it
[1:05:56] and that's the main thing
[1:06:00] when i'm fellowshipping with god
[1:06:02] completely
[1:06:17] to himself it's god all in all
[1:06:22] because he's in me and he's in you
[1:06:26] and he's in all ye and that is perfect
[1:06:29] fellowship yes
[1:06:30] el when we know that a brother or sister
[1:06:34] filled with the holy ghost
[1:06:38] they have the eternal waters the
[1:06:41] everlasting waters
[1:06:43] in them dwelling in them
[1:06:48] the eternal dwelling in them
[1:06:51] so that's how god achieves fellowship
[1:06:56] brother branham says in the in oneness
[1:07:07] let me try to cry out to you don't
[1:07:10] listen to the lie of the devil anymore
[1:07:26] to separate is it is breaking your
[1:07:30] fellowship with god
[1:07:35] god's oneness by the holy spirit
[1:07:41] then if you stay if you say you've got
[1:07:43] the holy spirit and it's not in agree
[1:07:45] with the word
[1:07:50] then you're not in oneness with god
[1:08:05] and nothing could penetrate those
[1:08:07] immovable walls
[1:08:17] the power the spirit was there creating
[1:08:20] the fellowship with one another
[1:09:07] and god's oneness is by the holy spirit
[1:09:13] brother branham said continues in
[1:09:15] oneness he says adam
[1:09:17] was a part of eve or was eve was a part
[1:09:20] of adam
[1:09:27] she was flesh of his flesh and bone of
[1:09:29] his bones
[1:09:32] that's
[1:09:43] now he's going to show us the correct
[1:09:46] union
[1:10:12] sometimes we have to step away and have
[1:10:15] a different perspective
[1:10:20] and say why is there so much fussing and
[1:10:22] fighting
[1:10:27] why is the husband yelling at the wife
[1:10:31] why is the wife yelling at the husband
[1:10:35] why are the kids doing this and the
[1:10:36] kid's doing that
[1:10:40] there there has to be a unity there
[1:10:56] you stay with the word of god
[1:10:59] you will never falter that word of god
[1:11:03] heavens and earth will pass away before
[1:11:05] the word passes away
[1:11:10] is
[1:11:18] and you will be in perfect unity with
[1:11:20] the family
[1:11:24] brother branham says you'll have your
[1:11:25] little altar there this is
[1:11:29] the wife will be the the minister there
[1:11:32] lies
[1:11:34] everyone will have their place
[1:11:37] and it's the same way
[1:12:00] amen amen
[1:12:04] amen uh we're going to be talking a
[1:12:06] little bit about the tower
[1:12:12] because in genesis all things begin
[1:12:17] we see the seed of religion start with
[1:12:21] adam and eve
[1:12:25] when adam and eve covered themselves
[1:12:30] and they created themselves a religion
[1:12:32] brother branham says
[1:12:36] but then we see in the tower of babel
[1:12:40] where religion started to grow
[1:12:44] religion where where organization began
[1:12:47] there don de aicomensola
[1:13:00] the tower of babel that's when they
[1:13:02] begin to build walls around themselves
[1:13:10] and they begin to denominate each other
[1:13:14] and say uh you can't come into this area
[1:13:21] it was a denomination
[1:13:24] it was an organization it was
[1:13:27] uh idolatry it was witchcraft
[1:13:32] it was all evils under heaven was in
[1:13:35] that place
[1:13:35] tower of babel
[1:13:40] but what were they trying to do trying
[1:13:42] to build this tower
[1:13:49] brother branham says in the future home
[1:13:50] of the heavenly bride room and the
[1:13:52] earthly bride
[1:13:53] this is speaking on enoch here
[1:14:02] now this being this way would answer
[1:14:05] exactly enoch's sign egypt
[1:14:31] and in this pyramid is seven steps going
[1:14:35] to the king's
[1:14:36] chamber yes
[1:14:41] watch the seventh step if you ever uh
[1:14:44] study the dimensions of the pyramid
[1:14:50] what comes out to take the oncomer to
[1:14:53] introduce to the king
[1:15:01] that is standing there you'll see the
[1:15:03] day you're living in in the pyramid
[1:15:08] position
[1:15:12] then he says in the cruelty of sin and
[1:15:14] the penalty
[1:15:16] that it costs to rid sin from our lives
[1:15:24] he says the second bible was written
[1:15:27] was written by enoch
[1:15:32] and put it in the pyramids so he created
[1:15:36] this seven
[1:15:37] pyramid
[1:15:41] and on the the top of that pyramid
[1:15:47] it was a temple it was the king's
[1:15:50] chamber brother branham said
[1:15:52] this and that's where they would meet
[1:15:56] the king
[1:15:59] and the bible and brother branham says
[1:16:01] that was the third
[1:16:02] bible this is that the third bible was
[1:16:07] written in those pyramids
[1:16:12] i don't know about you but that is
[1:16:14] tremendous
[1:16:17] that is tremendous that the third bible
[1:16:21] was written on a pyramid
[1:16:24] and that was the word of god
[1:16:28] he built a pyramid and that was the word
[1:16:31] of god
[1:16:46] and that was the word of god
[1:16:49] and the second one was the pyramid
[1:16:53] this is the word of god today
[1:16:57] the written word of god this is
[1:17:11] and at that time that was the word of
[1:17:14] god
[1:17:20] and the bible says that the whole earth
[1:17:23] was
[1:17:23] with one language
[1:17:28] and one speech and it came to pass as
[1:17:32] they journeyed from the east
[1:17:35] that they found a place in the land of
[1:17:37] china
[1:17:41] and they do out there
[1:17:47] and in verse 3 it says they said to
[1:17:51] one another
[1:17:56] go let us make brick and burn them
[1:17:58] thoroughly
[1:18:02] and they had brick for stone and slime
[1:18:04] for mortar electric
[1:18:09] and they said go let us build a city and
[1:18:12] a tower whose top may reach
[1:18:13] unto heaven
[1:18:19] and let us make a name lest
[1:18:22] we be scattered abroad upon
[1:18:37] they were building a tower
[1:18:48] enoch built this great pyramid the word
[1:18:51] of god
[1:18:52] instagram
[1:19:06] and that god took him and then here
[1:19:09] comes these
[1:19:10] these people these people that were full
[1:19:14] of sins
[1:19:16] these people that had the serpent seen
[1:19:18] in them
[1:19:31] but this tower was a false word
[1:19:35] because the word of god was in enoch's
[1:19:38] pyramid
[1:19:41] we see that many days many times now
[1:19:46] people try to build themselves under
[1:19:49] denominations
[1:19:53] they pick a word of the bible
[1:19:58] and they build a whole denomination
[1:20:00] around it
[1:20:02] denominationally
[1:20:28] they were trying to pervert god's
[1:20:31] original plans
[1:20:35] they knew that when they got kicked out
[1:20:37] of eden
[1:20:40] they didn't get kicked out like saying
[1:20:58] and the tree of eternal life dwelt in
[1:21:01] that place
[1:21:05] and they knew if they could get to that
[1:21:07] place
[1:21:10] they could have all their eternal glory
[1:21:14] they could have everything they needed
[1:21:18] but it was false brother branham says
[1:21:22] that in enoch's
[1:21:23] pyramid this is
[1:21:26] that
[1:21:30] that you couldn't even put a razor in
[1:21:32] between those stones
[1:21:37] and brother branham says that was the
[1:21:39] type of us is one
[1:21:54] but you look in the bible
[1:21:57] you see these people building uh
[1:22:01] having brick for stones
[1:22:05] they didn't really they didn't use real
[1:22:07] stone no sorrow
[1:22:19] these people needed mortar to build
[1:22:21] their tower their pyramid
[1:22:33] amen amen brother branham says in the
[1:22:36] message oneness
[1:22:50] now the tower of babel the union of
[1:22:53] cain's children
[1:22:54] with seth's children
[1:22:59] brought judgment it always brings god's
[1:23:03] judgment to the world see
[1:23:15] the descendants of the very act that
[1:23:18] broke their unity
[1:23:42] then you see them with says children
[1:23:45] trying to create a unity
[1:24:04] for what fellowship has righteousness
[1:24:06] with unrighteousness
[1:24:10] what communion hath with light with
[1:24:14] darkness
[1:24:28] and
[1:24:40] and what happens it disturbs everyone
[1:25:00] adam ran away from the presents
[1:25:03] so whenever i come and i fellowship with
[1:25:06] my wife
[1:25:09] i have fellowship with my children
[1:25:40] cristianos there becomes turbulence
[1:25:42] everywhere
[1:25:43] occasionally just whenever
[1:25:47] joshua and and um the the armies went to
[1:25:50] jericho
[1:25:51] josue los angeles
[1:26:00] but they lost the battle even though god
[1:26:03] gave them the words saying they would
[1:26:05] never lose a battle
[1:26:32] the lives become effective
[1:26:43] always whenever unbelief and belief is
[1:26:46] yoked together
[1:27:01] amen amen but brother branham says
[1:27:05] that there's always three kinds of
[1:27:06] believers
[1:27:09] amen amen they said
[1:27:13] let us make brick you say
[1:27:17] they said let us build a city
[1:27:21] they said let us make a name
[1:27:25] see you christianity's story is
[1:27:27] completely different
[1:27:29] de la cristina
[1:27:41] when there was a break in the spiritual
[1:27:46] and the fellowship between god and adam
[1:27:48] was gone
[1:27:53] who was it looking for who
[1:27:56] was it adam saying lord lord
[1:28:12] it was god looking for man
[1:28:16] that's the the story of christianity
[1:28:19] today
[1:28:21] i was in the world i was no good
[1:28:28] [Applause]
[1:28:53] we run away every single time
[1:28:57] but the story of religion historia de la
[1:28:59] region religion is a different story
[1:29:03] it's man uniting
[1:29:07] trying to reach heaven and all of its
[1:29:10] glory
[1:29:11] gloria i don't believe they are trying
[1:29:13] to reach heaven because they love the
[1:29:15] lord
[1:29:19] they weren't trying they what did what
[1:29:22] did a verse say
[1:29:24] uh verse four say que risel cuatro
[1:29:28] it said let us build a city and a tower.
[1:29:35] whose top may reach unto heaven
[1:29:39] let us make a name say agamos
[1:29:44] so if they would have built a tower to
[1:29:46] reach up to heaven
[1:29:50] you'd think they would say biensen de
[1:29:52] que uzidion let us build a tower to
[1:29:54] heaven
[1:29:56] so that we can worship the lord
[1:29:59] so we can mend back the unity
[1:30:04] no it was all self-glorification
[1:30:07] gloria it was all self-gratification
[1:30:12] let us go up to heaven
[1:30:16] so that i can make a name for myself
[1:30:38] because then anybody would have been
[1:30:40] able to receive
[1:30:42] eternal life
[1:30:59] and whenever they were separated their
[1:31:01] dominion left
[1:31:04] eternal life was gone the riches and the
[1:31:08] glory was all gone
[1:31:12] gloria when the spirit of the lord left
[1:31:14] them
[1:31:16] and today there's people uniting under
[1:31:18] towers of babel
[1:31:23] trying to achieve eternal glory
[1:31:26] gloria we see that in in the science
[1:31:35] trying to to um build stuff so that they
[1:31:38] can live forever
[1:31:42] killing each other
[1:31:51] it's all a money-making scheme
[1:31:53] everywhere
[1:31:57] trying to receive eternal glory
[1:32:00] gloria amen amen they're trying to
[1:32:03] receive
[1:32:04] something from god trying to achieve
[1:32:06] eternal life
[1:32:24] is a picture of the bottom of the earth
[1:32:30] trying to reach up to heaven that's not
[1:32:33] the way god works
[1:32:36] christianity is god reaching down to man
[1:32:42] that's always been the plan of god
[1:32:47] it's all united to reach to him
[1:32:52] but it brought division and confusion
[1:32:56] but yet there's still power in unity
[1:33:00] the lord said in in verse six
[1:33:06] and the lord said behold the people is
[1:33:08] one.
[1:33:11] they all have one language
[1:33:17] and this they begin to do
[1:33:21] now nothing will be restrained from them
[1:33:26] which they imagine to do
[1:33:31] there's power in unity
[1:33:34] there's power in unity
[1:33:37] amen amen god says there's nothing that
[1:33:41] will restrain them
[1:33:46] there's nothing that will hold them back
[1:33:48] from what they want to
[1:34:04] imagine if there's a family united
[1:34:06] together
[1:34:10] imagine if there's a church united
[1:34:12] together
[1:34:14] in one mind in one
[1:34:19] what is there to hold us back
[1:34:23] what is there to to to take away your
[1:34:26] healing
[1:34:30] there is nothing impossible
[1:34:33] when we're united under the word under
[1:34:35] the spirit of the lord
[1:34:39] they were under a fall in false unity
[1:34:44] and there was nothing that would
[1:34:46] restrain them from what they wanted to
[1:34:47] do
[1:34:51] and it said what they have imagined to
[1:34:54] do
[1:34:56] what was in their imagination
[1:35:38] he says and god saw the wickedness of
[1:35:40] man
[1:35:42] was great in the earth
[1:35:48] and every imagination of the thoughts of
[1:35:50] his heart was
[1:35:51] only evil continually
[1:35:54] or imagination
[1:36:10] that's why we have the blood of jesus
[1:36:11] christ
[1:36:14] you know no matter what there's always
[1:36:16] going to be bad thoughts coming in and
[1:36:18] out no
[1:36:19] importa
[1:36:22] but you have the power prosthetic
[1:36:26] to allow it to dwell in you
[1:36:30] or push that thought away
[1:36:33] you have that decision you have that
[1:36:37] decision to
[1:36:38] allow that thought to grow
[1:36:44] brother branham says the mind is a womb
[1:36:49] you allow those seeds those words of the
[1:36:51] devil to grow
[1:36:52] us
[1:36:56] and it'll be produced in the life you
[1:36:58] live
[1:37:01] if you allow those thoughts
[1:37:04] don't worry
[1:37:23] and what did these people do it says
[1:37:26] their imagination was
[1:37:28] evil continually simply
[1:37:34] they fought evil every day they used
[1:37:37] pelian
[1:37:39] they thought of evil things every day
[1:37:44] and whenever you allow that thought to
[1:37:46] grow in that womb of your mind
[1:37:51] you produce it in your actions
[1:37:54] you produce it in the way you talk
[1:37:59] you produce it in your tongue
[1:38:04] amen amen so god
[1:38:07] went down he said let us go down
[1:38:13] and confound their language
[1:39:08] brother branham now i'm going to turn
[1:39:10] the corner
[1:39:21] he said did you ever think that the
[1:39:22] tower of babylon compared with jacob's
[1:39:24] ladder
[1:39:29] has anybody read the story of jacob's
[1:39:32] ladder
[1:39:35] he continues and says how that they were
[1:39:39] trying to
[1:39:40] build stair steps around the tower that
[1:39:42] would reach up to heaven
[1:39:50] only trying to pervert jacob's ladder
[1:39:52] which reached from heavens
[1:39:54] to earth
[1:40:01] angels descending and ascending
[1:40:03] perverting it los angeles
[1:40:31] [Music]
[1:40:35] it has to be heaven coming down to earth
[1:40:40] if you'd like to turn with me to genesis
[1:40:42] 28.
[1:40:44] now this is the story of jacob
[1:40:49] the bible says genesis 28 11 17.
[1:40:56] and he lighted upon a certain place and
[1:40:58] tarried there all night because the sun
[1:41:00] was set and he took stones of that place
[1:41:02] and put them for his pillows
[1:41:04] and lay down in that place
[1:41:17] and he dreamed behold a ladder set upon
[1:41:19] the earth and the top of it reached
[1:41:21] to heaven behold angels of god ascending
[1:41:25] and descending on it
[1:41:30] is
[1:41:37] and behold the lord stood above it and
[1:41:39] said i am the lord
[1:41:41] god of abraham thy father and the god of
[1:41:43] isaac
[1:41:44] the land where thou liest to thee i will
[1:41:47] give it to you
[1:41:48] and to thy seed yeah
[1:42:01] and thy seed shall be as the dust of the
[1:42:04] earth and thou
[1:42:05] shalt spread abroad the west and to the
[1:42:07] east
[1:42:08] and to the north and to the south and in
[1:42:10] thee and in thy seed
[1:42:12] shall all families of the earth be
[1:42:14] blessed
[1:42:26] god was telling jacob something
[1:42:30] the one that threw you jacob
[1:42:35] there will be one that will bless all
[1:42:37] the nations
[1:42:40] through
[1:42:54] together all just to be won
[1:42:59] but it takes one spirit
[1:43:03] to unify the whole world together
[1:43:06] by one spirit we are all baptized into
[1:43:09] one body
[1:43:13] he wasn't just to bless one nation but
[1:43:15] to bless all
[1:43:19] and he continues on 15 he says and
[1:43:22] behold i am
[1:43:23] with thee and with and will keep thee
[1:43:26] in all places where thou goest and will
[1:43:28] bring thee
[1:43:29] again into this land for i will not
[1:43:32] leave thee
[1:43:32] until i have done which i have spoken to
[1:43:34] the of
[1:43:47] and jacob awake out of his sleep and he
[1:43:49] said surely the lord is in this place
[1:43:52] and i knew it not it is
[1:44:00] we we're talking about it this last time
[1:44:04] babel
[1:44:18] we have the
[1:44:27] many people say there's many ways other
[1:44:29] than jesus
[1:44:32] camino in verse 17 it says
[1:44:36] and he was afraid and he said how
[1:44:39] dreadful is this place
[1:44:41] this is none other but the house of god
[1:44:44] this is the gate of heaven
[1:46:22] no man hath ascended up to heaven but he
[1:46:24] that come down from heaven
[1:46:26] even the son of man which is in heaven
[1:46:32] what was that door jesus says i am that
[1:46:36] door
[1:46:38] we try
[1:47:06] unto hymn verily verily i say unto you
[1:47:12] hereafter you shall see heaven open
[1:47:17] and the angels of god ascending and
[1:47:19] descending upon the son of man los
[1:47:21] angeles
[1:47:25] he was the ladder he was that gate
[1:47:30] he was the way to the tree of life
[1:47:32] brother branham says
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:47] he left the glories of heaven the holy
[1:47:49] glory he left the highest name that
[1:47:51] could ever be called
[1:47:55] and he when he was on earth man give him
[1:47:57] the lowest name they could give him
[1:48:10] born in a major wrapped in rags off of
[1:48:12] the yolk of an ox
[1:48:16] de las paladio
[1:48:32] foreign he was made fun of sephora
[1:48:35] he was rejected and went to the lowest
[1:48:39] pit stooped down to the vile list of
[1:48:41] prostitutes
[1:48:44] is
[1:48:58] is die it's the day our fellowship is
[1:49:02] broken
[1:49:05] the day you disbelieve
[1:49:08] is the day you separate from my presence
[1:49:14] as soon as their fellowship was broken
[1:49:19] their fellowship between each other was
[1:49:21] broken
[1:49:24] anything without god is a broken
[1:49:26] fellowship
[1:49:29] it all comes back to jesus christ
[1:49:34] if you want healing if you want
[1:49:35] salvation if you want true
[1:49:37] fellowship
[1:49:41] it comes through jesus christ
[1:49:45] he came to restore all things
[1:49:49] if you need something from the lord
[1:49:53] go back to that dale calvary
[1:49:56] and you'll see your answer right there
[1:50:01] if you got a problem a habit go back to
[1:50:03] calvary
[1:50:06] go back to the slain word
[1:50:20] jesus died jesus
[1:50:26] hey man can i continue just for a little
[1:50:27] bit more
[1:50:31] he had no fellowship with his disciples
[1:50:36] he had no true fellowship you know true
[1:50:38] unity with his disciples
[1:50:44] the day you eat thereof is the day you
[1:50:45] die
[1:50:50] that is a punishment we all have to
[1:50:53] complete yes
[1:50:57] but then here comes this little man
[1:51:03] he paved the way for each and every one
[1:51:06] of us
[1:51:09] because we cannot have true fellowship
[1:51:11] if we're separated
[1:51:13] dead spiritually from god
[1:51:18] spiritually
[1:51:47] brother branham says that god separated
[1:51:49] himself
[1:51:52] from jesus christ how is that possible
[1:51:57] that god separated from himself
[1:52:05] jesus was crying and he was sweating
[1:52:07] droplets of blood
[1:52:08] jesus it wasn't because he was afraid of
[1:52:12] the cross
[1:52:15] it wasn't because he was going to die as
[1:52:16] a human no especially
[1:52:19] he was the resurrection in the life
[1:52:23] he's not afraid of death he walked up to
[1:52:26] lazarus and said lazarus come forth
[1:52:55] he wasn't afraid of physical death
[1:52:59] he was sorrowful because he had to
[1:53:01] separate from his own spirit
[1:53:07] he had to separate eternally from god
[1:53:19] the day you eat there is the day you die
[1:53:23] brother branham says in the rising of
[1:53:25] the sun this el monobram elements
[1:53:28] when god looked upon the body
[1:53:32] the spirit left him in the garden of
[1:53:35] gethsemane
[1:53:37] he had to die a man
[1:53:52] he didn't if he had went up there as god
[1:53:55] he'd never die that kind of death
[1:54:01] can't kill god but he had
[1:54:04] he didn't have to do it
[1:54:18] god had never separated the bride from
[1:54:21] the groom yet
[1:54:26] so when god looked upon the body of
[1:54:29] christ
[1:54:32] he saw both male and female
[1:54:37] it was all redeemed in that one body
[1:54:41] there are one the same the same words
[1:54:46] the same word spoke of the groom spreaks
[1:54:49] of the bride
[1:54:53] whenever god separated from jesus christ
[1:54:59] he saw the bride of jesus christ in him
[1:55:07] he created man and female he created he
[1:55:10] them but
[1:55:12] and adam eve was in adam
[1:55:16] and when
[1:55:29] but yet the true fellowship wasn't there
[1:55:32] yet
[1:55:35] and that's why god said it is not good
[1:55:37] that man be alone
[1:55:40] even though his bride was in him already
[1:55:54] but he said it's not good for men to be
[1:55:56] alone
[1:56:11] and out of her flesh that's when she
[1:56:13] fell
[1:56:16] but in her spirit she was perfect for
[1:56:19] perfect
[1:56:19] and whenever god saw the bride in jesus
[1:56:22] christ
[1:56:25] wherever jesus christ went ahead
[1:56:51] my god my god why hast thou forsaken me
[1:57:22] he saw him full
[1:57:30] and god says i'm going to have to
[1:57:32] eternally separate from you
[1:57:36] eternally
[1:58:04] that he would separate it from himself
[1:58:08] because you and i were in his mind
[1:58:13] jesus but brother branham says that adam
[1:58:15] slept
[1:58:16] this abraham slept isaac slept abram
[1:58:20] during
[1:58:21] but jesus had to die
[1:58:25] death is separation but the bible says
[1:58:28] in john 12
[1:58:29] 24. verily i very
[1:58:33] very very i say unto you except a corn
[1:58:36] of wheat fall into the ground
[1:58:38] and die
[1:58:44] it abideth alone he had to die
[1:58:49] but if it died it bringeth forth much
[1:58:52] fruit
[1:58:54] what was god's commission to adam
[1:58:57] he said multiply multiplication i said
[1:59:00] multiply
[1:59:11] he said out of your seat all of the
[1:59:13] nations will be blessed
[1:59:28] by one man's offense all dies
[1:59:32] but one man's righteousness all lives
[1:59:40] but he grabbed the keys of death in hell
[1:59:43] tomorrow
[1:59:46] and he opened the way for us
[1:59:50] amen amen god man realized he was a
[1:59:53] wanderer
[1:59:56] even
[2:00:00] the bible says that he was a wanderer
[2:00:05] that he was searching for a city whose
[2:00:07] builder and maker was gone
[2:00:12] was actually after the confusion of
[2:00:14] babel
[2:00:17] when they were trying to find a city
[2:00:19] whose builder and maker was gone
[2:00:30] amen amen amen let us stand to our feet
[2:00:34] i wish i could finish but we'll just uh
[2:00:36] finish another time
[2:00:52] what we need

[2:01:03] helpless without you
