gerald hughes he's a pastor to uh the church grace covenant tabernacle de gracia in colombia south carolina colombia carolina del sur i met the brother last saturday at a minister's meeting and it was truly a blessing to meet him and i would like to share some words that he shared with me is it trusting that our paths had not only crossed but blended together as we come up to the father's house so it's an honor to have our brother with us he'll be speaking to you for a couple minutes [Music] richard bless you recommended [Applause] we greet you in the lovely name of the lord jesus christ a very special privilege to be here tonight you know as the prophet of god said prophetically i just had one drop of the blood of the lamb the lord jesus christ oh i would walk so softly and hold it so close to my heart but he said i have something more precious than that in my hands tonight oh yes there's something more precious than the blood of the lord jesus christ of his blood amen amen oh and so i'm glad to be associated with you here tonight and they've give they've given me the honor of addressing the bride of christ what a great honor immediately and i didn't even know i was going to have this privilege tonight i wanted to come and sit and worship with you anyway i want to read the scripture okay and it's found in luke chapter 2 esta lucas el capitolo and i believe it's verse 8. and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night pastors and the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone around about them and they were sore afraid and the angel of the lord said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people new is born this day in the city of david the savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger esto o servirada signal agares el nino in bulton now i want to skip on down to verse 17. and they and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning i was thinking of the great message that the prophet of god preached entitled why it had to be shepherds and i wanted to say this in honor of our pastor tonight he has certainly displayed the spirit of christ to me as i had just the brief opportunity to meet him if you'll notice he says the first ones to know that the messiah was on the earth was pastors los because the shepherds know how to tend to and feed the sheep the bible says that they made this uh this event and this uh message that they had received this angelic message they ran with this message they made this message known abroad but two years later when the wise men arrived in jerusalem nobody knew where the messiah was and the world failed to recognize the first announcement of the messiah that same messiah is here again tonight amen amen oh my brother my sister ivaya hermano herman the prophet of god said the gates of hell are not against your denominations the gates of hell are not just against it's against the revelation of jesus christ being here ministry made known through malachi 4. god richly bless you i i i'm so thankful for this message there's never been a day like this day i existed there's never been a light shining so bright existed god richly bless you if you listen to me we're going to sing this song and introduce our pastor this evening for you all tonight [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh

he preached for us at the rental church that we had at mcdonald's so we're looking forward to hearing the word of god yeah brother in the precious name of the lord jesus christ [Applause] i would like if we can sing that song great is your faithfulness again [Music] [Music] it's here tonight [Music] you have come to praise the lord this evening [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] just as you are we'll be going into the word of the lord let's go to the book of genesis chapter 32. verse 26 i don't believe there's going to be enough space for everyone to drive down their own stakes because i believe you come determined for god to do something for you if not then why did you come just to spend time here i forgot to do something for you you have to have a decision tonight now just listen to what we're going to read verse 26 and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let you go except thou bless me. and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince has thou power with god and with men and has prevailed and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou asked after my name and he blessed him there juan says we'll go to now john 6 37 todd all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out amado esta beloved god and father we're here now to be able to like jacob to receive our blessing i believe [Applause] in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated brothers i called the message this way brothers i'm going to tell you a testimony that for me is very great i was under the weather i was sick uh ever since december i started having an issue uh yesterday i ended up being hospitalized and then some months went on and i couldn't feel my healing and i was really struggling the doctors they would check my heart and he said that my heart was in a bad condition my blood pressure was too high and i felt that that wasn't true an ex an exhaustion there were some times that i couldn't even speak i couldn't even preach nothing i had no strength i couldn't even speak brothers um for me and my brothers would pray for me for me some of you noticed what was happening and started praying for me within myself i was already i felt that there was nothing good that was going on with him as time went on i kept getting worse libras i lost actually 26 pounds and it was such a tremendous thing that was going on with me india and then finally one day i told my wife that i was going to go pray at the church and i told her i'm not coming back until god does something for me and tonight i want you to listen estamos and we're believing that tonight god will do something for you and i believe that god is here that's because he is here [Applause] at seven o'clock in the evening i went inside the church and i was praying i felt so bad i had no strength and my blood pressure skyrocketed in the pain it was so severe i said lord i'm not leaving this place you either heal me or take me and brother jacob had such a determination he knew that he was being persecuted he knew and he said i'm [Music] and he began to have some things he said that this man was uh driving down a stake and he said lord lord if you don't do something for me when you come you're gonna find a bunch of dry bones here he had such a determination brother said that god blessed him and if you did that back then he can do the same today with you and then it came to three o'clock in the morning and i felt pretty car to preach i and you know that the angels of the lord encounters around those that fear him god's i said lord i know your angels are here and at three in the morning i began to preach to them and then i began to pray at 4 40 in the morning i remembered that testimony yesterday today and if you don't come and every child of god is tested we're believing that he's and the greater the problem is that a minute longer and i was gone but you know what iglesia i came to church to drive down the stake bro god performed that enemy came once again i got worse just like i did it in the beginning and then i remember the testimony that brother bannon gives us and that [Applause] there's proof yesterday today and forever lord praise god does someone need god i'm challenging today he's here tonight and i gave him a certain amount of quotes of the message sometimes i read them sometimes i don't read them and it's a great job that he does he gets different types of preachers all the time and he says if i'm going too fast for you just let me know so let me tell you brothers [Music] because and god will give you that spiritual name get it if somebody wants it you have to wrestle you have to snatch it you have to believe it tommy osborne brother speaks of tommy osborne let him aista and remember tommy osborne was there just like you are here today brother branham said that tommy osborne said that you better know what you're talking about he says that when he was coming to to hit him when he was ready with his fists brother branham says to him and he said i'm going to show you to whose feet you're going to fall and when he raised his fist to be able to hit him brother says these words he says come out of him he says that man turned around and he fell down at brother branagh's feet in a message where he does talk about somebody and brother there's some men that came to brother ben and they said brother brandon he's now healed he already cast satan out of him he's already healed no he said no he's not healed he still worships that's why you come to church nothing has taken because what's the point he says i can pray to get the healing and tommy osborne is just watching and he says senor he says i want what that man has i want what that man he says that he went home he got until you and you know do you believe that god has done something for me now he grabs him and he says hey look tommy mira he says do you see that man that's there he says go under that oak he says are there are those kind of oak trees here that we can trust are there oak trees here that the young people can choose that they can go under a man and learn from him brother banham says that for like a year and a half he went with him and tommy osborne was with the brother for a year and a half and he says that years later he found him in new york he said and he says hey tommy how are you doing how many do you have in your congregation he says thirty thousand juantos he says how many three thirty thousand hey just listen carefully to what i'm telling you is someone here that wants to taste from god come forward and come forward come forward but this is is say it praise god [Music] until god in the name of the lord jesus christ in the name of jesus christ receive don't [Music] [Applause] you're not coming to the prison every one of the prophets that he told his wife and i'm not coming and the fortune tellers will say brother branham you were born under a sign the scripture itself when paul was walking from seven o'clock in the evening to 4 40. the next day in the morning and i was perfectly fine i had to drive down the street if it's a matter of you wanting it [Music] then you have to be willing to stay with god to meet him face to face not just a fantasy no no no no see it's not just saying oh okay and there had to be a stop when you're willing when you're truly willing brothers to have an encounter with god we need him to the time has come a mistake along the way it says lord forgive me if this is the spirit of the devil i don't want to have it i don't want it lord remember the religious man was telling billy get away from that but when he had an encounter he says that god's angel came in at three o'clock in the morning oh just a little while longer i'll do it tomorrow but at three in the morning get up and pray when you can't sleep don't say lord help me to sleep when you can't sleep get [Music] and on a regular basis when he gives the testimony it's because he had an encounter with it one time he says go with him but you're going to suffer the consequences that he went and when he goes he gets sick in his stomach he said that the angel of the lord came to him go and said and i don't want to be the same i want to come and worship you lord how many are tied down today if you're just going to be a spectator you do that at the funeral seriously you're just serious this is a party a feast he's alive [Applause] who [Applause] and say that we [Applause] do you think you worship at your house if you don't worship at the church much less where no one sees you that's true that's why you see me the way i am brother you're really crazy preaching at three in the morning and there's no one there i don't know about you but my eyes have been opened there's angels [Applause] pastor today we're driving down when you see things [Applause] oh brother you didn't drive down the stake back then check them out because when you drive down the stake you know what happens they no longer cause problems in the church there's no longer any more issues no we would need deacons like that oh no amen [Music] and only just pretended to do it later on they're going to say oh the sister she said she drove down the stake that's where the gossip begins so then the pastor can say you didn't drive down your steak they only planted it like this and then it fell over you know i believe that's important we see what is your reaction but i need a real encounter with the lord because it's just you and god the issue i'm the one that's going to keep that so i have to be really honest with god and say lord was he missing db well i felt good is he missing i felt good lord but keep giving me that faith lord i need that faith then demand go read the messages and the he says i want what that man has told me and in the campaign he should speak the same paralytic i'll give you the titles of the messages because i did say from the message from that time on the next message early spiritual experiences the next paragraph 64. listen to what he says but first we must review genesis to see why they were down in egypt he says what happened back then was the type of what's going on today why would god's people be out of the land now let's bring it to today why is it that god's people is outside the holy spirit but after all god promised that right there where the beginning was with abraham isaac and jacob in palestine in palestine why would the people not be in the place that god provided them why is it that god's people wasn't there listen that's the question of today you can speak a lot with your mouth but satan believes in trembles as well with your axe you show you don't want it you say i i want the lord and you still live any kind of life why is the church out of it why is it that the great christian church today living again like the book of acts and the most terrible condition that christianity has ever lived in today estamos just we're on right on the brim or the brink of a great terrific judgment iglesia lame for they the day your are not his words [Music] and there's something that must take place then why is it that we're outside the holy spirit well brother we have the message of the hour the pharisees have the message they had moses they had moses it's not remember if you want me to join you i can stay here and pray with you i can do it don't leave hermano i don't know if someone wants to stay here if you want i could say but it's better for you to have the encounter moses on the outside hermano brother i say again i am not obligating i want you to be blessed i'm longing for you to be blind lord and do something for me i still can't go on like this i can't be a hypocrite i can't keep playing church i can't be this way anymore please close your eyes [Music] [Music] a service without the altar call is not a complete service we can pray for you i believe that all things are possible [Music] i lost yes [Music] [Music] in you lord
