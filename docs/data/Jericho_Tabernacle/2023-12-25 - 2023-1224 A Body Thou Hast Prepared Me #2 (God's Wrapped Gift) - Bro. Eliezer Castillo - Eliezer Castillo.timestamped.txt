[54:26] 1 14 and
[54:31] 15 and it says in whom we have
[54:35] Redemption through his blood even the
[54:37] Forgiveness of
[54:38] [Music]

[56:23] Christ we ask all these things
[56:27] amen and amen amen amen you may be
[56:35] seated this my title this
[56:38] morning it's um I'm continuing with a
[56:41] the title a body thou Hast prepared
[56:46] me and and my subtitle this
[56:50] morning just because it's Christmas
[56:53] Eve it's God wrapped
[56:57] gift here in um the verse 14 and verse
[57:03] 15 it's showing something that we
[57:05] already
[57:07] know that through his
[57:10] blood that we have received the
[57:13] Forgiveness of our
[57:15] sins through his
[57:18] blood but but Paul he says that this man
[57:21] that shed his
[57:23] blood
[57:26] he was the very
[57:29] image of the invisible
[57:32] God everything that God
[57:35] created everything that God
[57:38] is from eternity all the way to
[57:42] Eternity it was hidden within this man
[57:45] Jesus
[57:47] Christ he was the in the image of that
[57:50] invisible
[57:53] God and if we go go down to verse
[57:57] 21 it shows what our situation and our
[58:00] and our condition
[58:03] was he says and you that were sometime
[58:07] alienated and enemies in your mind by
[58:10] Wicked Works yet hath he now yet hath he
[58:23] reconciled amen Brothers we were all
[58:26] we're all enemies of
[58:29] God right out of the womb we become
[58:34] enemies we become alienated from the
[58:38] Lord and and and Paul says by our
[58:41] [Applause]
[58:42] mind by our Wicked
[58:45] works now now brother bam says that
[58:48] we're a Triune
[58:52] being that that we have a a body a
[58:55] spirit and a
[58:57] soul and and here Paul is
[59:01] saying that our
[59:03] mind and our works which is our
[59:07] body are alienated from the
[59:10] Lord so this
[59:13] body this body is meant to be a temple
[59:16] of the
[59:18] Lord this body is meant to be dwelt
[59:22] in but because of our
[59:26] condition because of our mind and our
[59:28] Wicked
[59:30] works we become
[59:33] alienated but in 22 this is what he
[59:38] says but in this body or in the body of
[59:42] his
[59:44] flesh through
[59:46] death to present
[59:49] you holy and unblameable and
[59:52] unreprovable in his sight
[59:57] SES this body was alienated from
[1:00:02] God so then it took the image of
[1:00:06] God to come into a
[1:00:08] body he said through this body of
[1:00:13] Flesh through
[1:00:15] death he would reconcile us
[1:00:18] again and in verse 26 he
[1:00:22] says he says even the mystery which hath
[1:00:26] been hid from ages and from Generations
[1:00:29] but now is made manifested manifest to
[1:00:33] his
[1:00:39] Saints what was the mystery
[1:00:42] Brothers there was a mystery that was
[1:00:45] made manifested
[1:00:48] today this mystery was hidden throughout
[1:00:51] all the
[1:00:53] ages
[1:00:55] this mystery people try to find this
[1:00:59] mystery verse 27 it
[1:01:02] says to who God would make known what is
[1:01:06] the riches of the glory of this mystery
[1:01:09] among the
[1:01:11] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[1:01:15] of
[1:01:23] glory
[1:01:25] that's the
[1:01:26] mystery see we were alienated from
[1:01:30] God we don't deserve for the spirit to
[1:01:33] dwell in
[1:01:35] US sin has separated
[1:01:39] us sin took us away from his
[1:01:43] Spirit but then God came in a
[1:01:46] body and he allowed that body to die on
[1:01:49] the cross for
[1:01:52] us he allowed that body to
[1:01:56] suffer and when that body
[1:01:59] suffered he opened up a
[1:02:02] way where that
[1:02:04] mystery could be
[1:02:07] revealed and that mystery isn't way over
[1:02:11] there that mystery wasn't in some other
[1:02:15] place it's Christ in
[1:02:18] you that's the
[1:02:20] mystery that Christ dwells in his bride
[1:02:27] what a beautiful scripture
[1:02:29] amen now brother Bram he he uh read the
[1:02:35] scripture in the message Christ is the
[1:02:38] mystery of God
[1:02:42] revealed and that message is so profound
[1:02:45] for for the message believer
[1:02:51] bride because it shows where Christ is
[1:02:56] Brothers we can know that what what
[1:02:57] Christ did 2,000 years
[1:03:01] ago we can know what he did um even a
[1:03:05] 100 years
[1:03:07] ago but where is he
[1:03:11] today and in that
[1:03:13] message it showed what the mystery
[1:03:17] was now now just to give a little
[1:03:22] recap of of what I spoke last
[1:03:25] time just so we can pick it up where we
[1:03:28] start where we finished
[1:03:30] off um we spoke on how our bodies are
[1:03:34] designed to be temples of
[1:03:39] God to be the housing of the
[1:03:43] spirit and the temples of the
[1:03:46] Jews they were built just to be shadows
[1:03:49] and
[1:03:52] types so that they can show what God Was
[1:03:55] preparing to
[1:03:58] do and and and um stepen he gave the
[1:04:02] Pharisees a
[1:04:04] question he said how be it that the most
[1:04:07] high dwelleth not in temples made with
[1:04:14] hands he says for Heaven is my throne
[1:04:17] and Earth is my foot
[1:04:21] stool and he says where is my place of
[1:04:24] my
[1:04:27] rest and brother Bram says a body thou
[1:04:30] Hast prepared
[1:04:33] me that's what our bodies are meant to
[1:04:38] be God created each and every person
[1:04:43] here he created a spirit first the Bible
[1:04:48] says when he created man and
[1:04:52] woman he created the
[1:04:54] spirit and that Spirit was in the image
[1:04:57] of
[1:04:59] God and then he formed the
[1:05:02] body and and and then brother Bram says
[1:05:06] that God poured or blew the spirit of
[1:05:09] life into
[1:05:12] Adam and he became a living
[1:05:16] Soul so so we are beings not only to be
[1:05:19] tied to this
[1:05:22] Earth but but we are tied to Eternity to
[1:05:26] another
[1:05:29] dimension and and I begin to think about
[1:05:32] this world that we
[1:05:34] see and I I see that the problem
[1:05:38] is that be people begin to be more
[1:05:41] focused on this
[1:05:45] flesh how how is this flesh
[1:05:48] doing H H how does it
[1:05:52] feel how are my feelings
[1:05:56] and we begin to live in the
[1:06:00] flesh now we see that in the whole
[1:06:03] world that we fulfill the desires of the
[1:06:08] flesh whe whether whether it's its um
[1:06:11] immoral
[1:06:14] desires if it's desires to become a
[1:06:17] great rich
[1:06:19] person to be
[1:06:23] popular fill uh desires of
[1:06:27] Anger of different
[1:06:30] emotions people begin to live off of
[1:06:32] their
[1:06:35] emotions live off of the
[1:06:38] flesh when when a man is is tied to the
[1:06:42] Earth and to Heaven
[1:06:46] also brother brandom I I once heard him
[1:06:51] say how people would throw $50 $100 meat
[1:06:55] cones on
[1:06:59] them and they would raise up their
[1:07:02] nose thinking they were better than
[1:07:06] somebody and he said if you raise he
[1:07:09] would raise their nose so
[1:07:12] high that if it rained it would drown
[1:07:16] them because because they were putting a
[1:07:19] meat
[1:07:22] coat pile of
[1:07:26] potash where brother bam says only cost
[1:07:29] 84
[1:07:32] cents brother brandham he he begin to
[1:07:35] devalue the
[1:07:38] body showing that the body is is no
[1:07:43] good and it's not that it's no
[1:07:46] good but but it becomes no
[1:07:51] good it becomes void
[1:07:54] it becomes
[1:07:56] animalistic without the Holy
[1:07:59] Spirit and we we begin to value
[1:08:03] that now now I'm not talking about you
[1:08:06] precious
[1:08:08] Brothers unless you want to receive
[1:08:10] it but the whole
[1:08:12] world
[1:08:14] everybody we are are so focused on her
[1:08:17] outer
[1:08:19] appearance on these brother bam says
[1:08:21] these 16 elements
[1:08:25] we we care about what the world see how
[1:08:28] the world perceives this outer
[1:08:32] flesh when there's a soul inside
[1:08:36] there crying out for
[1:08:38] life that is worth more than 10,000
[1:08:45] worlds but but we we value these
[1:08:49] things brother brandham says in the
[1:08:51] greatest battle ever fought
[1:08:55] see he says see it's your mind that
[1:08:58] opens up the
[1:09:01] door now I I just want to see how our
[1:09:04] body
[1:09:06] works brother brandom explained the
[1:09:08] whole
[1:09:09] thing that we are a Triune
[1:09:12] being and and and we are
[1:09:15] temples meant to be dwelt
[1:09:19] in so so then he's saying it's your mind
[1:09:23] that opens up the
[1:09:25] door and closes the door and listens to
[1:09:29] your
[1:09:31] conscience listens to your
[1:09:33] memory and listens to your
[1:09:37] affections so so we we have seed taste
[1:09:40] feel smell and
[1:09:43] hear that's that's this body right
[1:09:47] here then there's another realm in that
[1:09:50] man where it it's conscious affection
[1:09:55] it's memory and all of those things
[1:09:58] within that
[1:10:00] man and he says that your mind begins to
[1:10:03] open up to these
[1:10:06] things and and and most of the
[1:10:09] world they'll only know those two Realms
[1:10:12] of
[1:10:15] themselves then they begin to separate
[1:10:18] themselves from the
[1:10:20] spirit which is in the Inner Man
[1:10:26] in in the the inner the holy of
[1:10:30] holies but people that they'll separate
[1:10:32] themselves
[1:10:33] from and they open up the
[1:10:36] door they open up their
[1:10:38] mind to to affections and and
[1:10:43] emotions or or the things that they
[1:10:46] see the things that they
[1:10:49] taste man you you know what's amazing
[1:10:51] about this time of year
[1:10:56] the
[1:10:57] tamales
[1:10:59] the the
[1:11:01] the all of the
[1:11:04] food oh brother we'll govern ourselves
[1:11:06] with that
[1:11:08] taste oh what else do we govern
[1:11:11] ourselves in this
[1:11:13] time with our sight what am I going to
[1:11:16] get for Christmas
[1:11:19] today we're we're so we're governed by
[1:11:22] these things
[1:11:25] but rightly
[1:11:26] so that we're connected to this
[1:11:30] world we can't help but to have a
[1:11:33] connection to this
[1:11:36] world I I can't help but to love the
[1:11:38] food that I
[1:11:41] love and love the things that I
[1:11:45] love but whenever we begin to be
[1:11:47] governed by
[1:11:51] it we began to cater or when we begin to
[1:11:54] cater to the
[1:11:58] flesh these five
[1:12:02] senses or even the the inner five
[1:12:06] senses we we actually begin to cater to
[1:12:09] the
[1:12:12] devil brother brandham says in the
[1:12:14] Oneness of
[1:12:16] unity he said God made you so you could
[1:12:20] be
[1:12:22] empty
[1:12:24] so so he made the human being to be
[1:12:29] empty for when you was
[1:12:32] born you was made with a place to be
[1:12:38] filled and then he says
[1:12:41] this by
[1:12:43] Nature you're a child of the
[1:12:48] devil that's pretty
[1:12:50] harsh but that's what the prophet said
[1:12:54] by
[1:12:55] Nature we're all Little
[1:12:58] Devils we come to this world speaking
[1:13:02] lies we come to this world stealing and
[1:13:05] lying and
[1:13:07] hating because of what happened in the
[1:13:09] Garden of
[1:13:12] Eden he says and then an an evangelist
[1:13:15] will come
[1:13:17] along and and you repent and get all
[1:13:20] cleaned
[1:13:21] up then and he continues on in the um
[1:13:25] the unity of one God in the one
[1:13:31] church you can be of the um you can be
[1:13:34] full of
[1:13:37] foolishness you can be full of
[1:13:41] nonsense you can be full of
[1:13:44] anything but you can't stay
[1:13:48] empty the Bible says you
[1:13:51] can't so so Why Can't We Trust our five
[1:13:55] senses
[1:13:57] then why can't we trust the inner five
[1:14:01] senses because no matter
[1:14:04] what if we're not serving
[1:14:07] God we think we're just serving the
[1:14:11] flesh but we can't stay
[1:14:14] empty there's something manipulating
[1:14:17] those five
[1:14:19] senses there's something manipulating
[1:14:21] those emotions
[1:14:24] your
[1:14:26] decisions he continues on in the
[1:14:28] greatest battle ever
[1:14:31] fought there it
[1:14:33] is right there those
[1:14:35] channels you just get them and open
[1:14:39] up don't you just bypass
[1:14:43] them then if Satan can get through
[1:14:48] there see Satan's always going to try to
[1:14:50] get through
[1:14:52] there
[1:14:53] get by the
[1:14:56] conscience and all these other
[1:14:58] things and then get right down here to
[1:15:01] the end of the soul in the
[1:15:06] mind now if if he can just get
[1:15:10] you you'll never you'll never look at
[1:15:13] one of them until you first let him here
[1:15:15] in
[1:15:18] here but when you have to let
[1:15:22] him
[1:15:24] then when he gets
[1:15:26] in he's got
[1:15:29] control then what does he
[1:15:33] do he begins to use the
[1:15:36] conscience he begins to use
[1:15:39] this begins to use this
[1:15:41] Outlet what is it
[1:15:44] see see taste uh feel smell and
[1:15:50] hear imaginations conscience memories
[1:15:53] reasonings
[1:15:56] affections he begins to use all of those
[1:15:59] different little
[1:16:02] channels as long as he could get in
[1:16:04] above this one
[1:16:08] here why can't we live in the
[1:16:11] flesh because we've got an enemy
[1:16:15] today brother Brenham says it's the
[1:16:17] greatest battle ever
[1:16:21] fought and you have an
[1:16:23] enemy that is going to attack your
[1:16:27] conscience that's going to attack your
[1:16:30] memory your affections he's going to
[1:16:33] attack your
[1:16:35] body he's going to attack you with
[1:16:38] sickness he's going to attack you w with
[1:16:40] certain things that are going on in your
[1:16:44] body you we wonder why why am I so
[1:16:47] anxious all the
[1:16:49] time why can't I just have a good
[1:16:52] night's rest
[1:16:55] why is bad thoughts always coming to my
[1:17:00] mind because there's an enemy
[1:17:03] there in the beginning Satan picked and
[1:17:06] chose the part of a
[1:17:10] man he chose the
[1:17:13] intellectuals he chose the the
[1:17:16] head and God took the
[1:17:19] heart God took where it was important he
[1:17:22] took that part
[1:17:25] where the Holy Spirit can
[1:17:27] dwell but the devil will take your
[1:17:30] mind and he'll attack it and attack it
[1:17:33] and
[1:17:34] attack
[1:17:36] until because this is the beauty of all
[1:17:39] of
[1:17:40] it he cannot affect
[1:17:44] you he he's a big
[1:17:47] Bluff he he's he's a
[1:17:50] liar he cannot enter into your body
[1:17:54] until you let
[1:17:56] him and then when you allow
[1:17:59] him then you begin to fulfill the lusts
[1:18:02] of the
[1:18:04] flesh you think you're just thinking
[1:18:07] with your own
[1:18:09] thoughts but you have somebody in the
[1:18:12] control
[1:18:14] tower that is trying to take
[1:18:17] over now we know that the first battle
[1:18:20] was in
[1:18:21] heaven and brother brandham says that it
[1:18:24] was Ang Battle of
[1:18:28] angels and then it was cast out onto
[1:18:31] human
[1:18:33] beings it wasn't cast just to the
[1:18:37] Earth it was cast onto you and
[1:18:41] I there's a great battle going on even
[1:18:44] as you sit tonight this
[1:18:47] morning am I going to accept certain
[1:18:51] things am I going to reject reject this
[1:18:54] what am I going to do after
[1:18:56] this what are my
[1:18:58] desires how do I
[1:19:01] feel all those are running through our
[1:19:07] mind now now my question
[1:19:10] is why is the devil so
[1:19:14] eager to attack the children of
[1:19:17] God to take control over our
[1:19:21] lives and possess the children of
[1:19:26] God let us turn to um
[1:19:30] jude6
[1:19:46] un the Bible
[1:19:48] says he says and the angels which kept
[1:19:52] not their first estate but left their
[1:19:56] own habitation he ha reserved an
[1:20:00] everlasting chains under Darkness unto
[1:20:02] Judgment of the great
[1:20:19] day now that that word estate they left
[1:20:22] their first
[1:20:25] estate they left their original
[1:20:30] condition but left or or but left their
[1:20:33] own
[1:20:35] habitation now I've said this before
[1:20:38] right before I ended on the last
[1:20:42] message but that word habitation is the
[1:20:44] word
[1:20:48] okarian which means a Dwelling
[1:20:51] Place a
[1:20:53] habitation of the body as a dwelling
[1:20:57] place for the
[1:21:00] spirit now now this
[1:21:02] word this Greek
[1:21:05] word was only in the Bible two
[1:21:09] times and this is this is the second
[1:21:12] time it's it's
[1:21:14] mentioned that they left their
[1:21:17] habitation now people say oh they left
[1:21:21] heaven but that that Greek word means a
[1:21:26] body that it was a body that they
[1:21:29] left that they were cast
[1:21:32] out because he was the
[1:21:36] lightbearer he he had a
[1:21:38] body and the Bible says that
[1:21:41] body was the most
[1:21:44] beautiful that body he was the most
[1:21:47] beautiful
[1:21:48] angel he was the brightest
[1:21:51] angel Lucifer means a
[1:21:55] lightbearer and God took his
[1:21:59] light from that angel and and Jesus once
[1:22:03] saw as they cast out
[1:22:06] Devils he saw Satan Fall Out of Heaven
[1:22:09] like
[1:22:12] lightning brother Bram says in the
[1:22:14] message question and
[1:22:17] answers question and answers on
[1:22:21] Genesis
[1:22:23] he says 2/3 of of the earth is in
[1:22:29] sin and more than that which two-thirds
[1:22:32] of Angels were kicked
[1:22:36] out see how how he switches
[1:22:40] here he says twoth thirds of angels was
[1:22:42] kicked
[1:22:44] out and those demon spirits come into
[1:22:48] people and habitate their
[1:22:51] body
[1:22:56] they were
[1:22:57] Angels they were kicked out and were
[1:23:00] demons
[1:23:03] spirits and what did the Bible
[1:23:05] say they left their
[1:23:08] habitation and brother Bram here
[1:23:11] says now they come into people and
[1:23:14] habitate their
[1:23:18] body see what I mean they're demons
[1:23:23] that once they once
[1:23:27] existed listen to what he says they once
[1:23:31] existed and they come into the people
[1:23:34] and give them a
[1:23:40] nature amen amen now now he now brother
[1:23:45] brandham says
[1:23:47] this or you know what let us um the Lord
[1:23:52] let us go to 2
[1:23:55] Corinthians 5 1 and 4 and we're going to
[1:24:00] show where where's the next
[1:24:03] word of okarian
[1:24:10] okarian now now the reason
[1:24:13] why I I I've been pressed to speak
[1:24:19] this so we can understand
[1:24:23] why we are here in this
[1:24:25] earth why did we have to come here to be
[1:24:29] tempted why do I have to be in this body
[1:24:32] of
[1:24:34] death this is the greatest opportunity
[1:24:37] that we have
[1:24:39] here amen amen so 1 Corinthians
[1:24:46] 51 now let's see how how Paul he
[1:24:49] explains our
[1:24:51] bodies
[1:24:53] he says for we know that our Earthly
[1:24:55] House of this Tabernacle were dissolved
[1:24:59] we have a building of God and house not
[1:25:02] made with hands Eternal in the
[1:25:16] heavens look how he he's explaining the
[1:25:19] body Earthly house
[1:25:24] Tabernacle
[1:25:26] building
[1:25:28] house and he's talking about these two
[1:25:32] houses he says when this Earthly
[1:25:37] Tabernacle when it's
[1:25:40] dissolved we already have one waiting in
[1:25:45] heaven we already have a
[1:25:48] body so in verse two he says for in this
[1:25:52] We Grown earnestly to be clothed with
[1:25:56] our house which is from
[1:26:05] heaven so to be
[1:26:07] clothed and this word with our
[1:26:12] house is the next word
[1:26:16] okarian he's not talking about
[1:26:18] heaven he's not talking about a great
[1:26:21] big mansion
[1:26:23] or a
[1:26:25] house Paul is talking about a
[1:26:28] body he says whenever we're
[1:26:31] clothed with this Oker in this
[1:26:35] house we where we're
[1:26:38] groaning to be clothed with this
[1:26:40] Heavenly
[1:26:42] Body and whatever those angels were
[1:26:46] clothed
[1:26:49] with the Bible says they were cast out
[1:26:51] from
[1:26:54] they left that okar in that
[1:26:57] house now they're what are they there
[1:27:01] are spirits roaming
[1:27:04] around that's
[1:27:07] illegal he says this if so that that
[1:27:12] being clothed we shall not be found
[1:27:20] naked man Paul he just knows how to
[1:27:24] talk he's talking about a house now he's
[1:27:26] talking about a
[1:27:29] clothing but he's saying we're clothed
[1:27:31] we're we're groaning to be clothed with
[1:27:33] this
[1:27:35] house he he he says he says if that be
[1:27:40] so we will not be found what
[1:27:45] naked
[1:27:48] naked a
[1:27:50] spirit we won't be just a floating
[1:27:53] Spirit
[1:27:56] somewhere but but when we leave this
[1:27:59] house we're going to step into another
[1:28:02] house we're not going to be a floating
[1:28:06] spirit and and and we know that when I'm
[1:28:10] I'm sorry for using these
[1:28:13] phrases but we know when somebody's
[1:28:17] Naked Brother that's
[1:28:20] illegal put some clothes
[1:28:24] we will not be found without a
[1:28:28] body a roaming
[1:28:31] Spirit which is illegal in this
[1:28:35] world because when God he he created
[1:28:39] man he created the spirit but then he
[1:28:43] says I want you to have contact with
[1:28:45] this
[1:28:47] world I want you to walk
[1:28:50] around I want you to have
[1:28:52] Dominion so I'm going to put this
[1:28:55] Spirit into this
[1:28:57] body so that you can have
[1:29:00] dominion and whenever your Dominion is
[1:29:03] over I'll have another body so that you
[1:29:07] can go into another
[1:29:09] dimension and and Paul says he says you
[1:29:13] will not be found illegally wandering
[1:29:18] [Applause]
[1:29:19] around verse four he says
[1:29:23] for that that are in this Tabernacle do
[1:29:29] grow being
[1:29:32] burdened not that we would be
[1:29:35] unclothed but clothed upon that
[1:29:39] mortality might be swallowed up in
[1:29:45] life so that word clothe
[1:29:48] clothed it means a spiritual and ET
[1:29:51] Eternal
[1:29:55] habitation that we should dwell
[1:30:00] in now you you cannot dwell in these
[1:30:03] natural Dimensions as a
[1:30:08] spirit God made a body for
[1:30:11] you so that the spirit can operate in
[1:30:14] this
[1:30:17] earth and when the body
[1:30:20] dies the spirit will go to a certain
[1:30:24] Dimension depending on how they used
[1:30:28] this
[1:30:30] body how did you use this
[1:30:34] Tabernacle what did you do with
[1:30:37] it and depending on what you did with
[1:30:39] this
[1:30:41] body if we fulfilled the lust of the
[1:30:46] flesh we're going to be going to an a
[1:30:50] habitation according to what we did with
[1:30:54] this and and I
[1:30:57] realized that this is this
[1:31:00] spot where where Paul says we
[1:31:04] grown we grown to be
[1:31:07] changed We Grown to go to
[1:31:10] heaven but even though we
[1:31:13] grown yet in this body this is where it
[1:31:16] matters brothers and
[1:31:18] sisters this is where Grace is
[1:31:22] once you leave this
[1:31:24] body your fate is
[1:31:27] sealed once you leave this
[1:31:30] body there is no more
[1:31:32] grace once you leave this
[1:31:34] body your purpose is
[1:31:37] over it's in this
[1:31:40] body even though it's a body of
[1:31:43] death even though we get sick all the
[1:31:47] time even though there's sadness in this
[1:31:50] body
[1:31:52] struggles there's hurt and there's
[1:31:55] pain yet this is where it matters the
[1:31:59] most this is where you'll
[1:32:02] know if you were there in the
[1:32:05] beginning and you'll be there in the
[1:32:07] end on how you use this
[1:32:12] body amen amen so San and the
[1:32:17] devils are essentially in this
[1:32:20] earth
[1:32:23] illegally they are spirits roing around
[1:32:26] the
[1:32:28] earth you don't see a body you you you
[1:32:32] never see you never see an angel try to
[1:32:35] dwell in a
[1:32:37] person they don't need
[1:32:40] to but why do these
[1:32:43] Devils want to attack the children of
[1:32:46] God want to try to dwell in
[1:32:50] them now this
[1:32:52] quote encapsulates this
[1:32:57] message he says in the greatest battle
[1:32:59] ever
[1:33:01] fought a devil is almost
[1:33:06] harmless unless he has something to work
[1:33:11] in well if he had a body he's not
[1:33:15] harmless if he had a body he didn't need
[1:33:17] to be roaming
[1:33:20] around but he's this
[1:33:22] Spirit Ephesians 2:2 it
[1:33:26] says wherein in times past we ye walked
[1:33:29] according to the course of the world
[1:33:31] according to the prince of the power of
[1:33:34] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:33:38] the children of
[1:33:49] Disobedience he governs the air
[1:33:52] he's the prince of the power of the
[1:33:56] air and he didn't say the
[1:33:59] angel he said the
[1:34:01] spirit that now worketh in the children
[1:34:04] of
[1:34:06] disobedience in Luke 11 2426 it
[1:34:12] says you know what we I'll just um say
[1:34:15] it but jot it
[1:34:19] down it says when an clean spirit is
[1:34:22] gone out of a
[1:34:24] man what does it
[1:34:26] do it goes and wanders
[1:34:31] around it goes into the Bible says dry
[1:34:34] places seeking
[1:34:37] rest now now God asked this
[1:34:41] question he he said um the throne is or
[1:34:45] the heaven is my
[1:34:46] Throne the Earth is my foot
[1:34:50] stol
[1:34:55] but what is the place of my
[1:34:57] rest God's trying to seek
[1:35:00] rest what are these Devils trying to
[1:35:04] do the Bible says going through Dry
[1:35:07] places seeking
[1:35:10] rest and when they can't find anywhere
[1:35:14] else they go to and fro from the
[1:35:18] earth he says I'm going to go back to my
[1:35:23] house this
[1:35:24] body he said I'm going to go back to my
[1:35:28] habitation and whenever he goes to that
[1:35:31] place he sees that house that
[1:35:35] body all
[1:35:37] empty all
[1:35:39] clean and he says oh I'm going to bring
[1:35:41] my buddies
[1:35:43] in and he says he's eight times worse
[1:35:46] than he was when
[1:35:50] he that's what the these Spirits
[1:35:52] are they're trying to find a
[1:35:56] habitation because because this
[1:35:59] body is meant to be operated
[1:36:04] with by the
[1:36:06] spirit if if a a demon could just
[1:36:11] materialize then he could just cause
[1:36:13] Havoc with
[1:36:16] Humanity but he and he wouldn't be uh
[1:36:19] constantly looking for a human
[1:36:23] to live
[1:36:24] in but they they're trying to find the
[1:36:27] children of
[1:36:29] God because this is where the kingdom of
[1:36:31] God
[1:36:33] lies the devil he wanted a greater
[1:36:35] Kingdom than
[1:36:39] Michael and whenever God brought all the
[1:36:42] kingdom to heaven or to
[1:36:45] Earth he said I'm going to set my
[1:36:47] kingdom in the heart of
[1:36:50] man and the the devil says I want that
[1:36:55] Kingdom now now to go
[1:36:58] quickly why does
[1:37:00] Satan why does he have a
[1:37:04] right why does he have a right to to go
[1:37:08] into a
[1:37:10] person who is the temple of
[1:37:13] God and destroy their
[1:37:15] lives why does he have that
[1:37:19] right how can he do
[1:37:22] that now brother brandham says this now
[1:37:26] now whoever wants the quotes please come
[1:37:29] to me and I'll give you my whole
[1:37:33] message in in the message Ephesian uh
[1:37:37] the Ephesian Church
[1:37:41] age in the the seven Church age
[1:37:46] book brother brandham says
[1:37:48] this now why did it have to be
[1:37:52] so why did why was it that that seed of
[1:37:56] the serpent must come this
[1:38:00] way he says Man was created for
[1:38:05] God man was to be a temple of
[1:38:10] God the place of God's rest the Holy
[1:38:13] Spirit was
[1:38:18] man the temple acts 7
[1:38:25] 46-51 he says who found favor before
[1:38:28] God and desired to find a tabernacle for
[1:38:32] uh for the for the god of
[1:38:37] Jacob but Solomon built him an
[1:38:41] house how be it that the most high
[1:38:43] dwelleth not in temples made with
[1:38:47] hands as sayith the
[1:38:50] prophet is my throne and Earth is my
[1:38:52] foot
[1:38:56] stol what house will you build
[1:38:59] me sayith the Lord or what is my place
[1:39:02] of my
[1:39:03] rest hath not my hand made all these
[1:39:08] things yeff stiff necked uncircumcised
[1:39:11] in hearts and
[1:39:16] ears he always always resist the Holy
[1:39:19] Ghost as your father's did so do
[1:39:24] ye brother bham says Satan has known
[1:39:28] this all
[1:39:30] along he knew that man was supposed to
[1:39:33] be a
[1:39:35] temple he also wants to indwell man even
[1:39:39] so even as God
[1:39:43] does but God has reserved that right for
[1:39:49] himself see the devil devil wants to to
[1:39:52] dwell in
[1:39:54] man but God reserved that right only for
[1:39:59] himself Satan cannot do
[1:40:02] that God Alone appeared in human
[1:40:07] flesh Satan could not um could not and
[1:40:10] cannot do
[1:40:12] that he does not have creative
[1:40:16] Powers the only way Satan could
[1:40:19] accomplish what he wanted to
[1:40:23] do was enter the serpent in Eden even as
[1:40:28] he entered by evil spirits into the
[1:40:31] swine of
[1:40:39] GAD so he couldn't enter into
[1:40:42] man so he found the best
[1:40:45] thing he he studied the
[1:40:48] serpent he studied this man
[1:40:51] and he said I can enter into
[1:40:55] that God does not enter into
[1:40:59] animals but Satan can and will
[1:41:01] accomplish and will and will to
[1:41:03] accomplish his
[1:41:07] ends he could not have a child directly
[1:41:10] by Eve as Mary as God did by
[1:41:16] Mary so he entered into the serpent and
[1:41:19] be beguiled Eve
[1:41:23] he seduced
[1:41:25] her and and by by her did Satan have a
[1:41:29] child
[1:41:33] vicariously Cain bore the full spiritual
[1:41:37] characteristics of
[1:41:41] Satan and the animalistic Central
[1:41:47] fleshly characteristics of the serpent
[1:41:52] no wonder the holy spirit
[1:41:55] said that Cain was of that Wicked
[1:41:59] Woman he
[1:42:00] was that's how he got
[1:42:03] in he continues
[1:42:06] on he says the fall would be caused by
[1:42:10] Satan had to have flesh to make
[1:42:15] fall Satan had to come through flesh
[1:42:19] also but Satan could not come through
[1:42:22] human
[1:42:24] flesh to make the fall as Christ come
[1:42:27] into the human flesh to restore the
[1:42:34] Fallen but there there was an animal the
[1:42:38] serpent so close to
[1:42:40] man that Satan could get into that
[1:42:44] beast and through that Beast he could um
[1:42:48] get to the human get to the human flesh
[1:42:51] and cause the
[1:42:56] fall and inject himself thereby into the
[1:43:00] human
[1:43:02] race he injected himself into the human
[1:43:07] race and that's
[1:43:09] why the devil can tamper with
[1:43:12] us that's why he has the
[1:43:15] right because Satan uh beguiled
[1:43:19] the Through The
[1:43:22] Serpent and the full image of
[1:43:27] Satan the image of the
[1:43:30] Beast was in that
[1:43:32] Serpent and whenever the the the blood
[1:43:36] it transferred through the
[1:43:40] children it had all the characteristics
[1:43:43] of
[1:43:45] Satan and and and whenever the sons of
[1:43:48] God saw that the daughters of men were
[1:43:54] fair in Noah's
[1:43:56] time that brother bam says that's when
[1:43:59] there was a great
[1:44:03] mixup a and God had to destroy the whole
[1:44:07] earth because God's pure
[1:44:11] seed was being corrupted by the serpent
[1:44:16] seed and as they went through the ark
[1:44:21] there was there was women that was
[1:44:22] pregnant with
[1:44:25] children that had the serpent
[1:44:28] seed and that serpent seed went through
[1:44:31] the whole human
[1:44:34] race that seed of the
[1:44:38] devil that n that
[1:44:41] nature and now the devil has a
[1:44:44] right to come and knock at your
[1:44:47] heart and try to beguile you
[1:44:51] so that he could dwell in the children
[1:44:53] of
[1:44:54] God he has that right
[1:44:59] now and then that's why I wonder why why
[1:45:02] Satan contended for Moses's
[1:45:07] body maybe because he said I have the
[1:45:11] right that's my
[1:45:13] body I I
[1:45:16] deceived so that I can have that
[1:45:19] body
[1:45:21] says that this old feeble
[1:45:24] body that it belongs to
[1:45:27] Satan he sends that says that in the
[1:45:29] message the true sign that's
[1:45:34] overlooked and what he tries to do with
[1:45:36] his
[1:45:38] body is he'll allow it to to fall on the
[1:45:42] ground and let the skin worms and the
[1:45:44] bugs eat
[1:45:46] it and then he'll go to the next
[1:45:49] person and destroy that
[1:45:52] flesh with
[1:45:54] disease and then destroy the other
[1:45:57] flesh that's why he's
[1:45:59] here but in
[1:46:01] closing God he was too great to receive
[1:46:04] to go into the human
[1:46:08] body he he he was hiding himself in in
[1:46:12] Badger
[1:46:13] skins he was hiding himself in these
[1:46:16] temples built with man's
[1:46:19] hands God
[1:46:20] the devil took that
[1:46:23] right and God was too holy to dwell in
[1:46:25] us
[1:46:27] now his Spirit was too holy to to even
[1:46:31] be
[1:46:34] around but going back to
[1:46:37] Colossians he says we were
[1:46:41] alienated we were
[1:46:43] enemies in our mind and in our
[1:46:47] works but in the body of his flesh
[1:46:52] through
[1:46:53] death he presented us unblameable and
[1:46:58] unreprovable God had to come the legal
[1:47:02] way brother brandham said that the
[1:47:05] greatest gift that was ever
[1:47:09] given the greatest Christmas gift ever
[1:47:12] given to
[1:47:14] humanity was wrapped in a little
[1:47:17] baby it Michael and
[1:47:21] Gabriel they said your children your
[1:47:23] children are
[1:47:24] lost the devil does anything they want
[1:47:27] to do with
[1:47:28] them God says this takes a man-sized
[1:47:33] job I'm not going to send an
[1:47:35] angel I'm not going to send my great
[1:47:38] spirit but I'm going to go into a
[1:47:42] body and brother B says Thou was the
[1:47:44] greatest Christmas gift
[1:47:47] ever God wrapped in a little baby
[1:47:51] all of the Jews all of the people were
[1:47:54] waiting for
[1:47:55] God Waiting for God to come down into
[1:48:00] chariots but God came down in a little
[1:48:03] feeble
[1:48:05] body and the people said it's
[1:48:08] him it's this
[1:48:10] person not knowing it's all of
[1:48:14] eternity dwelling in a human
[1:48:17] body that's what God's gift to us
[1:48:21] that God was returning
[1:48:24] back us to our original
[1:48:27] condition and whenever he went up on the
[1:48:30] cross brother Bram said that that human
[1:48:35] flesh that was was was veiling the
[1:48:38] almighty
[1:48:40] God that wrapping
[1:48:43] paper that WRA that wrapped all of
[1:48:47] God he said it rented into
[1:48:51] it opened up and he said The Mercy Seat
[1:48:54] has been
[1:48:56] opened now God's
[1:48:58] spirit can dwell in his
[1:49:01] people now God can his
[1:49:05] mystery can dwell in you you can have a
[1:49:10] spirit and you can be an
[1:49:14] overcomer and whatever the devil tries
[1:49:16] to
[1:49:17] do God can be hiding
[1:49:21] just like the devil did all these
[1:49:23] years he tried to hide in
[1:49:26] flesh now God is hiding in
[1:49:29] flesh and there was one day as you would
[1:49:31] like to stand with
[1:49:33] me there was one day this
[1:49:37] man he he was going over in a
[1:49:42] ship he was tired from
[1:49:46] preaching but he had a purpose to go to
[1:49:48] a certain place
[1:49:51] that place was called G
[1:49:54] Gad he said I need to go to that
[1:49:57] place and as he was there resting cuz he
[1:50:00] was tired of
[1:50:03] preaching the Bible says that all the
[1:50:06] devils in that little
[1:50:10] sea begin to to rumble and begin to
[1:50:14] create a
[1:50:16] storm for some reason they were trying
[1:50:18] to stop this man
[1:50:22] and all of his disciples were
[1:50:25] scared so they went and they woke up
[1:50:28] Jesus how could you be asleep in this
[1:50:32] time Jesus says oh you of little
[1:50:35] faith he go stands up on that
[1:50:38] boat it was just a
[1:50:41] body he wasn't this great strong
[1:50:45] man the omnipotence in
[1:50:48] there he said peace be
[1:50:52] still and all the storms quieted
[1:50:56] down and finally that little
[1:50:59] man stepped on that
[1:51:02] Shore that man was that was possessed
[1:51:04] with eternity
[1:51:08] itself and as he stepped off that
[1:51:11] boat if the musicians would like to
[1:51:14] come that little man stepped off that
[1:51:18] boat and right when he stepped off the
[1:51:21] boat there was a man possessed with many
[1:51:27] devils and he goes and he sees this
[1:51:30] little
[1:51:31] man but he saw what the disciples
[1:51:35] couldn't
[1:51:36] see see when God he said peace be still
[1:51:39] to the
[1:51:43] storm these people
[1:51:45] said what manner of man is
[1:51:48] this who is this
[1:51:50] man that even the storms obey
[1:51:54] him they didn't even know who it
[1:51:57] was but when he stepped on that
[1:52:00] ground there was a demon possessed
[1:52:04] man that knew exactly who it
[1:52:07] was finally
[1:52:10] God he was possessed with all of
[1:52:16] eternity this devil came to him began to
[1:52:20] worship him and he said why are you
[1:52:23] tormenting
[1:52:24] me why are you
[1:52:27] here and Jesus says what's your
[1:52:29] name he says my name is
[1:52:32] Legion because we're we're
[1:52:35] many we thousands among
[1:52:38] thousands and he says get out of that
[1:52:41] man see this was the first
[1:52:44] time since the fall of
[1:52:47] Satan where the devil was cast out
[1:52:51] again and now those that receive the
[1:52:56] spirit those that God is hiding in each
[1:52:59] and every one of those
[1:53:02] eyes those that are bearing Christ right
[1:53:06] now you have that same
[1:53:09] Authority you have that same
[1:53:12] Authority so when the Devil comes to
[1:53:16] tempt you can do the same thing
[1:53:20] I cast you out get out of here
[1:53:24] s in the name of the Lord Jesus
