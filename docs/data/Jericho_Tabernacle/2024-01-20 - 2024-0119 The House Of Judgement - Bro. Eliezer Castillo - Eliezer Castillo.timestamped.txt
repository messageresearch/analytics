[33:30] you um let us go straight to the
[33:32] scriptures if you would uh like to turn
[33:34] with
[33:35] [Music]
[33:38] me to verse uh first Peter verse 5 or
[33:43] chapter
[33:47] 5 or let's do uh chapter 4 and verse
[33:50] [Music]
[33:55] 17 let's just remember to keep our our
[33:59] pastor in prayer and sister Elsa in
[34:03] [Music]
[34:05] prayer as they go over there for some
[34:08] family matters in in El
[34:14] Paso and I believe he'll be ministering
[34:17] um this Sunday
[34:20] also so let's just keep him in prayer as
[34:23] he he's out
[34:25] there
[34:28] the Bible
[34:30] says for the time has come that judgment
[34:34] must begin at the house of God and if it
[34:38] first begin at us what shall the end be
[34:42] of them that obey not the gospel of
[34:44] [Music]
[34:51] [Music]
[34:55] God let us bow our heads
[34:59] Heavenly
[35:01] Father Lord first of all we just want to
[35:04] thank you Lord for allowing us to be
[35:10] here we thank you for your holy spirit
[35:13] that is always present here
[35:18] Lord whether whether we are expecting or
[35:22] whether we are
[35:25] not Lord you still faithful
[35:29] father you're still faithful and full of
[35:34] grace and father I ask this evening
[35:38] Lord that your Holy Spirit might go
[35:43] through and flow through each and every
[35:45] person
[35:47] father as your word goes
[35:51] through I ask Lord that you speak to us
[35:55] this evening father
[35:59] that you may help us
[36:01] Lord for we are a needy
[36:04] people Lord we we give it all unto
[36:08] you we ask that you take control of this
[36:13] service in the name of the Lord Jesus
[36:16] Christ we
[36:18] pray amen and amen amen amen you may be
[36:23] seated I want to thank the musicians
[36:28] it's um just a beautiful atmosphere that
[36:32] that can be created just by our worship
[36:38] amen you know sometimes I just like
[36:41] listening to brother brandham tapes of
[36:43] just him
[36:47] singing and just that simple music can
[36:51] bring down the presence of God wherever
[36:53] I'm
[36:55] at
[36:59] because it's not how how how great we
[37:04] sing but it's the heart behind that
[37:11] singing um so I I want to um just speak
[37:15] a few few
[37:19] minutes and my title this this
[37:23] evening is uh the house of judgment
[37:28] that sounds like a very um maybe a harsh
[37:36] title but this scripture it it it says a
[37:40] lot here in verse
[37:45] 17 Peter he he's talking about suffering
[37:49] in in the previous
[37:54] verses and he's telling the
[37:58] church let nobody
[38:02] suffer as a
[38:05] murmurer as an
[38:07] evildoer as a thief as a busy
[38:13] body don't be suffering for those kind
[38:16] of
[38:19] causes because if I would like to say
[38:23] this that kind of suffering
[38:27] it's
[38:30] warranted but but then he
[38:32] says but if any man suffer as a
[38:37] Christian let him not be
[38:40] ashamed let him glorify on go in God's
[38:46] behalf because you're suffering as a
[38:50] Christian and then in in verse 17 he
[38:55] says for before the time is
[39:00] come that the Judgment must begin at the
[39:04] house of
[39:07] God and he says and if it first begins
[39:09] at
[39:12] us what shall the end
[39:16] be so I
[39:19] realize that judgment it has a a
[39:24] process that there is a beginning and an
[39:27] end to to
[39:30] judgment it first it starts at the house
[39:34] of
[39:36] God then he asks this
[39:39] question where will the end
[39:42] be and in
[39:45] Revelations we see the end of
[39:48] judgment Revelations 20 and verse
[39:54] 11 where John he said
[39:57] says I saw a great white
[40:02] throne and him that sat on
[40:06] him from whose face the Earth and Heaven
[40:10] fled
[40:13] away and there was no uh there was found
[40:16] no place for
[40:19] them and I saw the dead small and great
[40:23] stand before
[40:25] God
[40:27] and the books were
[40:29] open another book was
[40:32] open which was the book of
[40:35] life and the dead were judged out of
[40:38] those things which were written in the
[40:44] books according to their
[40:47] works and the Sea gave up the
[40:51] dead in the dead which were in
[40:54] it and the uh and death and hell were
[40:58] delivered up the dead which were in
[41:03] them and they were judged every man
[41:06] according to their
[41:10] works that is the end of
[41:13] judgment he said judgment begins at the
[41:16] house of God but the
[41:21] end what shall it
[41:24] be it is the white throne
[41:28] judgment where people are going to be
[41:30] judged by their
[41:34] Works Paul says you are not saved by
[41:39] works but by Grace you are saved through
[41:44] faith not of yourselves lest you should
[41:49] boast but it is a gift of
[41:53] God I don't want to be there in that
[41:56] great day of
[41:59] judgment I don't want to be standing
[42:01] there being judged by what I
[42:06] did because all of these scary things
[42:10] that the world tries to
[42:15] offer the the the way the world says how
[42:19] scary the devil
[42:24] is there there is no fear so
[42:32] great as the fear of the
[42:37] Lord that the the um the Bible
[42:41] says it says Don't Fear the ones that
[42:43] kill the
[42:46] body but fear the one that can kill body
[42:49] and
[42:53] soul and is able to destroy the the soul
[42:57] and the body in
[43:02] hell that is the white Throne
[43:05] judgment that is somewhere that no man
[43:08] no woman would would want to stand
[43:14] there I remember in my early
[43:19] years I would hear people
[43:22] say oh well if I'm not the bride at
[43:24] least I I'll be the fullish
[43:29] virgin
[43:31] what what an ignorant statement to
[43:36] say that we nobody want should ever want
[43:39] to stand the Judgment of
[43:44] God to stand there before Jesus
[43:50] Christ where brother brandham
[43:53] says that his his his uh uh hair was
[43:57] like like uh
[44:00] snow and his eyes were like flames of
[44:05] fire that was the great
[44:08] judge he said that same those same
[44:12] eyes that were once dimmed with
[44:17] tears that once cried for his friend
[44:20] that
[44:23] died knowing that he had all the power
[44:26] of Eternity in
[44:30] him yet he still cried for those that he
[44:35] loved and after a few
[44:39] minutes he said Lazarus come out of
[44:43] there brother Bram says if he wouldn't
[44:46] have said his
[44:49] name and he would have just said come
[44:52] out all of the graves would have came
[44:56] came
[44:57] out now you have this same
[45:02] person this same Jesus Christ that we
[45:05] know in
[45:08] love with eyes as
[45:11] fire that is looking the Bible says
[45:14] throughout the the Sea and the
[45:19] Earth and all of the earth is trying to
[45:22] flee away from this vision
[45:28] and then he
[45:29] speaks he says come out of
[45:33] there and the the earth and the
[45:37] Sea give up the
[45:40] grave and give up the
[45:42] dead that same Jesus
[45:45] Christ in the white Throne
[45:48] judgment judging us by our
[45:53] work there there there will not be
[45:56] any attorney there to to plead our
[46:02] case there won't be anybody there to say
[46:05] to to die for our
[46:10] sins that's that is a
[46:13] reality that's not something well well
[46:16] brother you shouldn't say those
[46:20] things that's what's going to
[46:23] happen and by grace
[46:26] we are here
[46:28] today but there is going to be a day
[46:30] that that is going to
[46:34] happen that is the end of
[46:39] judgment that is the finality of
[46:45] everything but where did this judgment
[46:48] this great terrible judgment
[46:53] begin it says it begins at the house of
[46:59] God there was one
[47:02] time where David he
[47:05] sinned it's a very strange sin that he
[47:10] did he took a senses of the
[47:14] people and for some reason that that
[47:17] caused Israel to
[47:21] sin and go and God he came down and he
[47:26] says I'll give you three
[47:30] choices you are going to have to pay for
[47:33] your
[47:35] sin he says you either have three years
[47:39] of
[47:41] famine in Israel in is in Judah in or
[47:46] you have three months uh of of
[47:50] uh turmoil or tribulation with the
[47:54] sword
[48:00] or you'll have three days of
[48:04] plagues that the angel of the Lord will
[48:06] pour
[48:09] out now these are judgments that the
[48:12] Lord is giving to his
[48:17] child now now judgment starts at the
[48:21] house of
[48:24] God let me say it this
[48:26] way judgment starts at God's
[48:31] house go judgment starts at God's
[48:37] family the ones he
[48:40] loves and he says David you have to pick
[48:43] out of these three
[48:46] judgments David began to
[48:49] think he said if we have
[48:54] famine somebody caused by
[48:58] man if we go by the
[49:02] sword it's going to be under the
[49:05] man but
[49:08] plagues that poured out by the angel of
[49:11] the
[49:13] Lord that is your judgment
[49:16] Lord he said Lord give me the
[49:20] plagues because under your hand of
[49:24] judgment
[49:26] you have far more mercy on
[49:31] me by your
[49:33] judgment I don't want to fall under the
[49:35] Judgment of
[49:37] man I don't want to fall under the
[49:40] Judgment of anything else but your
[49:42] judgment
[49:46] Lord and that's what that is when we
[49:49] come to the house of the
[49:53] Lord we don't come to to preach good
[49:59] message or a message about
[50:03] myself to promote
[50:06] anything but when when somebody
[50:09] comes they have to
[50:12] preach the word of
[50:14] God for our
[50:16] benefit for our
[50:19] edification so that we can be
[50:23] better so that I can be better
[50:26] and it starts here in this
[50:30] place brother Bram says in the message
[50:33] how can I
[50:37] overcome but when we come
[50:41] here we are here for one specific
[50:49] purpose I just highlighted that in my
[50:52] tablet real
[50:54] quick
[50:56] we are here for a specific
[51:01] purpose this is the house of
[51:05] correction this is the
[51:08] throne this is the Throne of
[51:12] God and judgment goes out Goes Forth
[51:16] from the house of
[51:19] God now it sounds pretty
[51:23] harsh but listen to what brother says
[51:27] here and here is where we come
[51:32] together Where We Gather in
[51:36] Envy no no Where We Gather in
[51:41] hate Where We Gather in
[51:44] judgment Where We Gather in
[51:48] love with one
[51:51] another as only Christians can love
[51:57] this is a love not anybody can
[52:01] love only Christians can love this
[52:06] way but in
[52:08] here we are under a leadership of the
[52:12] Holy
[52:15] Spirit the Holy Ghost is Among
[52:19] Us that's what I
[52:21] want that's what I believe we have
[52:26] the Holy Ghost is among
[52:29] us there is no big eyes and little
[52:33] yous there is no greater than
[52:37] another the great one is the holy spirit
[52:41] here that's why we're
[52:43] here gathered in one
[52:46] Accord in
[52:48] love why the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost
[52:51] is Among
[52:54] Us
[52:56] and here to
[52:57] be to take a reckoning among
[53:03] us to see where our short places
[53:08] are our
[53:10] shortcoming and how we can catch from
[53:13] where we should
[53:17] be over to where we ought to be
[53:21] now where we
[53:24] are and where we ought to
[53:27] be and that's what we
[53:30] study ministers study those
[53:34] places for their
[53:36] people when when they see the
[53:39] people the
[53:41] lack then they begin on
[53:44] that now this is here listen to the
[53:49] brother brandham says
[53:51] here now soon I think
[53:56] that the church maybe is taking just a
[53:59] little step higher at this
[54:05] time there there's a steps and steps
[54:09] that we go higher and higher with the
[54:15] Lord he says this is the time where
[54:18] we're taking another
[54:22] step now we brother Bram says there is a
[54:25] specific purpose why we're here in this
[54:31] church we come to
[54:34] worship we come to give him the honor
[54:37] and the
[54:39] glory we we we come here assembled
[54:44] together for the
[54:47] purpose of coming to the
[54:51] throne the Judgment
[54:54] throne but Brothers I love this
[54:59] judgment this judgment is full of
[55:03] grace this judgment is full of of
[55:08] Glory knowing that every time I'm judged
[55:11] by his
[55:14] word I I change through the Holy
[55:19] Spirit I become better and
[55:22] better because of the word word that is
[55:25] being preached
[55:28] out I have a greater Revelation when I
[55:30] get to worship my
[55:36] lord it's uh such a beautiful
[55:40] thing brother brandham he says in the
[55:43] mark of the
[55:45] beast he says as down through the
[55:50] age here at the
[55:53] Tabernacle regardless of of what people
[55:57] thought I've tried to stay straight on
[56:00] the
[56:03] scripture I love
[56:05] people but sometimes you have to hurt
[56:09] them because the church is the house of
[56:14] correction the Judgment seat of God is
[56:18] at the
[56:22] church now now was tapes that brother
[56:26] brandham didn't want
[56:31] published because it was only to the
[56:35] Tabernacle that that he he went and he
[56:38] preached
[56:40] it whether how hard it
[56:44] was or how much Revelation he
[56:47] had he said I didn't want that to go out
[56:50] to the General
[56:53] Public
[56:55] and sometimes the things that he would
[56:57] even
[57:00] say he said that even the people at the
[57:03] Tabernacle wouldn't
[57:07] understand he said he would say things
[57:10] under the anointing under the unction of
[57:13] the holy
[57:17] spirit that he wouldn't even dare
[57:19] telling them off of the
[57:23] pulpit
[57:25] and we
[57:26] know that that was the power of the Holy
[57:31] Spirit now now maybe many might disagree
[57:34] with
[57:37] me but when I read the book of
[57:41] Acts I saw how a church should
[57:45] be that a church isn't covered by four
[57:52] walls in fact they probably didn't have
[57:55] a church for
[57:59] years that yeah they didn't have a
[58:03] building they would go from home to home
[58:06] to
[58:08] home and as they would go there they
[58:10] would
[58:12] preach and the Holy Spirit would come
[58:16] down wherever they
[58:19] were because they were the
[58:23] church and then nicoladis
[58:27] begin to put people above
[58:32] others creating these great big
[58:37] Cathedrals making priests and and other
[58:43] offices to be over
[58:47] people so that they can conquer the
[58:50] people but but in reality the book of
[58:54] Acts is the rawest form in the perfect
[58:57] Church brother Bram
[59:03] says but the
[59:05] prophet he came through this
[59:09] way to stand behind the
[59:14] pulpit to go throughout the
[59:17] Nations stand behind brothers
[59:22] pulpits be under their their
[59:26] order so that he could preach the
[59:28] unadulterated
[59:31] truth and through that through that
[59:36] way he was able to save
[59:40] millions and bring people to
[59:44] Christ and we hear it on the
[59:47] tapes we could see it in the
[59:49] video as the sisters would come by right
[59:53] next to the pulpit
[59:57] and he began to discern their
[1:00:00] thoughts through the Holy
[1:00:03] Spirit God began to use this
[1:00:07] form and he blessed the prophet through
[1:00:11] that and today that's where we're at
[1:00:15] today where we assemble
[1:00:19] together the Bible says forsake not to
[1:00:22] assemble ourselves together
[1:00:26] this this is somewhere where we can come
[1:00:29] and this should be a a warm place from
[1:00:32] the coldness of the
[1:00:41] world you know when I was a
[1:00:44] child I would uh have have
[1:00:49] dreams and and and I wasn't living a
[1:00:52] right
[1:00:53] life
[1:00:55] so I would always have a dream of me
[1:00:58] being outside of a
[1:01:03] building and you could see people
[1:01:06] smiling and and happy and there's a
[1:01:08] warmth inside that
[1:01:18] building and I couldn't get
[1:01:21] in I couldn't get in and would try and I
[1:01:25] would try but I couldn't get
[1:01:28] in and I
[1:01:30] realized that that is the warmth of
[1:01:33] Fellowship amongst
[1:01:37] Believers that out in the
[1:01:40] world people are going
[1:01:43] insane brother brandham says the world
[1:01:46] has become
[1:01:50] insane but the reason why the young
[1:01:53] people
[1:01:55] are good upstanding young
[1:01:58] people may maybe they make mistakes here
[1:02:01] and
[1:02:04] there but the reason why that they're
[1:02:06] living a better life than those that are
[1:02:08] out
[1:02:13] there they're under the protection of
[1:02:16] their their family and the community and
[1:02:19] the
[1:02:23] church under under the protection of the
[1:02:25] holy
[1:02:27] spirit this this is where the protection
[1:02:32] is the world is going to flood their
[1:02:37] mind with a bunch of
[1:02:40] ideas with a bunch of
[1:02:43] trash but here is where we can listen to
[1:02:46] the unadulterated
[1:02:50] word that is going to save their
[1:02:53] souls and take them
[1:02:55] out take them out from a pitiful
[1:03:00] condition take them out of of a lying
[1:03:06] condition take them out of a a druggy
[1:03:10] condition and place them into Heavenly
[1:03:13] places in Christ
[1:03:16] Jesus in a warm place like
[1:03:21] this with brothers and sisters with
[1:03:26] love loving one
[1:03:31] another that is the place this
[1:03:36] is this is not a
[1:03:40] routine it it can become
[1:03:43] routine we can make it
[1:03:46] routine and we can make it of none
[1:03:51] effect just like as as the the priest
[1:03:54] would come and and and uh sacrifice the
[1:03:59] lamb all the first
[1:04:02] time they're
[1:04:04] shaking I I don't know if anybody's ever
[1:04:07] killed an
[1:04:10] animal if you've ever hunted or
[1:04:13] something like
[1:04:14] that or or you grew up in a
[1:04:18] farm but the first
[1:04:21] time you're shaking like this
[1:04:25] uhuh when I when I when I killed my
[1:04:27] first
[1:04:29] animal I I felt bad cuz that poor thing
[1:04:31] was trying to
[1:04:36] survive but you're there trying to thank
[1:04:39] you Lord for the
[1:04:42] food I had to justify
[1:04:46] myself IM imagine the
[1:04:49] priest this little lamb that they've
[1:04:52] raised for years
[1:04:55] it was the perfect
[1:04:57] lamb all the other ones had a bigger ear
[1:05:02] here a bigger eye
[1:05:05] there a black spot
[1:05:08] there but this perfect lamb
[1:05:11] here this perfect
[1:05:13] one they brought it up here to The
[1:05:17] Altar and they began to
[1:05:21] know that all of their sins
[1:05:25] all of their
[1:05:27] transgressions we're going to go upon
[1:05:29] this little lamb
[1:05:31] here and they pulled his neck and
[1:05:33] started to
[1:05:36] chop and they say thank you
[1:05:39] Lord thank you forgiving me for my for
[1:05:42] for forgiving me of my
[1:05:45] sins thank you Lord and then them them
[1:05:49] full of
[1:05:51] blood knowing that the price has been
[1:05:57] paid oh they were
[1:06:00] shaking they felt the feeling of death
[1:06:06] there but year after year after year
[1:06:10] begin to
[1:06:13] pass where it began to become a
[1:06:18] routine to where they didn't care
[1:06:22] anymore that they knew they could sin
[1:06:24] all
[1:06:26] year knowing that they can go there
[1:06:29] slaughter a lamb and go on to their
[1:06:35] lives brother brandham
[1:06:37] said the Bible
[1:06:39] declares that this is the house of
[1:06:44] judgment and there is an
[1:06:46] altar where a lamb has been
[1:06:51] slain and the Holy Spirit
[1:06:54] the Holy
[1:06:55] Spirit where we couldn't touch that Holy
[1:07:01] Spirit we couldn't even stand by it
[1:07:04] without
[1:07:07] dying but now we can come here
[1:07:12] boldly now we can come here and praise
[1:07:14] inside this shakina
[1:07:20] glory and get our sacrifice of praise
[1:07:26] and say Lord thank you
[1:07:29] Lord I was full of sin
[1:07:33] Lord father today I messed
[1:07:36] up Lord today I
[1:07:39] fell But Here I Come Again
[1:07:42] Lord knowing that he will cover your
[1:07:48] sins that's what this place
[1:07:51] is this is a sanctuary
[1:07:55] this is a
[1:07:56] refuge for those that are in
[1:08:00] need for those that that need something
[1:08:03] from the
[1:08:05] Lord that no man can
[1:08:10] satisfy it could be satisfied with the
[1:08:12] spirit of the Lord
[1:08:15] here brothers sisters I'll take that
[1:08:18] judgment any
[1:08:21] day if God's got something against
[1:08:25] me Lord tell me
[1:08:28] Lord Lord if there's a judgment I have
[1:08:30] to
[1:08:32] pick Lord I'll pick your judgment any
[1:08:35] day
[1:08:37] Lord knowing it's full of grace and full
[1:08:40] of
[1:08:42] Glory Full of
[1:08:49] Mercy he
[1:08:52] says he says says the Judgment seat is
[1:08:55] at the
[1:08:59] church and then in the token he says
[1:09:03] this he says let me say this to
[1:09:07] you my Christian
[1:09:10] friend our
[1:09:13] attorney is also our
[1:09:16] judge see we're under judgment
[1:09:20] today the bride is under judgment today
[1:09:25] but I have good
[1:09:28] news that that same judge that is going
[1:09:31] to judge you
[1:09:34] tonight he's also your
[1:09:37] attorney he's also the one that's going
[1:09:39] to pull you
[1:09:42] out he says our judge became our
[1:09:45] eternity
[1:09:50] attorney the case is
[1:09:52] settled
[1:09:54] when you receive his
[1:09:56] pardon the judge himself came
[1:10:00] down and became our the
[1:10:04] attorney and the attorney and the judge
[1:10:07] is the same
[1:10:10] person God became
[1:10:13] man that he may justify Man by his own
[1:10:19] death that he placed upon
[1:10:22] him and in Hebrews
[1:10:28] 4:12 4:12 to16 I want to read all these
[1:10:34] Scriptures it says for the word of God
[1:10:37] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[1:10:41] any two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:10:44] dividing aunder of the Soul and Spirit
[1:10:46] and of the joints and Marrow and a
[1:10:49] discerner of the thoughts and the intent
[1:10:52] of the heart
[1:11:08] neither is there any creature that is
[1:11:11] not manifest in his sight but all things
[1:11:15] are naked and open unto the eyes of him
[1:11:17] who of of him who we do to or we have to
[1:11:22] do to this
[1:11:33] Every
[1:11:35] Creature they're all manifest in his
[1:11:39] sight it reminds me of of
[1:11:43] Revelations where is it says his eyes
[1:11:45] were as flame as
[1:11:49] fire and that he looked throughout the
[1:11:51] sea in the earth and the sea in the
[1:11:53] Earth would flee from
[1:11:59] him there's nothing that can flee his
[1:12:04] sight he's here looking
[1:12:07] today but in verse 14 see what he
[1:12:12] says we're not dealing with the judge
[1:12:15] with eyes of flame of
[1:12:20] fire he says seeing that we have a great
[1:12:24] high
[1:12:28] priest that's who we're dealing with
[1:12:32] today that is passed into the heavens
[1:12:35] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[1:12:38] our
[1:12:44] profession for we have not an high
[1:12:47] priest which cannot be touched with the
[1:12:49] filling of our infirmities but was in
[1:12:52] all points tempted as we are yet without
[1:13:05] sin so how should we come to this house
[1:13:08] of
[1:13:11] judgment how should we come to to this
[1:13:14] this
[1:13:17] Throne he said let us therefore come
[1:13:20] boldly unto the throne of grace that we
[1:13:24] may obtain mercy and find Grace to help
[1:13:27] in time of
[1:13:38] need that's that's where we
[1:13:41] come that that's why we have reverence
[1:13:43] in this
[1:13:45] place not because U somebody's name is
[1:13:49] on
[1:13:51] it not not because it's it's so so and
[1:13:54] so
[1:13:56] Church no because this is where we meet
[1:14:02] God I I can
[1:14:04] say that many many of
[1:14:07] you are with God
[1:14:10] daily every day but then there's some
[1:14:15] people that sometimes don't have time
[1:14:18] for
[1:14:20] God sometimes a sinner will come in
[1:14:25] sometimes a backslider comes
[1:14:28] in and he's he or she has been outside
[1:14:31] of the presence of
[1:14:34] God they need that correct
[1:14:39] atmosphere and that atmosphere is the
[1:14:42] Holy
[1:14:46] Spirit and and that
[1:14:49] judge will judge their
[1:14:52] lives he it will be the only one that
[1:14:56] judges it's the word the Bible
[1:15:00] says the word that is sharper than any
[1:15:03] two-edged
[1:15:07] sword it'll discern our
[1:15:11] thoughts it'll discern our
[1:15:15] hearts our motives if they're right or
[1:15:17] the
[1:15:20] wrong see see man is not the discern
[1:15:25] Brothers I can't judge
[1:15:28] anybody I I can't I you know what I've
[1:15:34] realized that the human
[1:15:37] being they're so quick to
[1:15:43] condemn it's easier to condemn somebody
[1:15:46] we don't
[1:15:49] like and and have Grace for the ones
[1:15:52] that we do like
[1:15:55] even though they do the same
[1:16:00] transgression and so so we can't handle
[1:16:03] the
[1:16:06] Judgment we leave that judgment to
[1:16:10] God you know what I've realized about
[1:16:12] this thing
[1:16:15] here this is the word of
[1:16:18] God this is the
[1:16:22] sword this is the greatest weapon
[1:16:28] ever the a great what do they call it uh
[1:16:31] weapon of mass D
[1:16:37] destruction this
[1:16:40] weapon and people might say well it's
[1:16:43] just a
[1:16:45] book it's just a
[1:16:48] Bible this is greater than a a nuclear
[1:16:52] bomb
[1:16:54] you know if it this is put in the wrong
[1:17:00] hands look at what what happened with
[1:17:02] the Catholic
[1:17:06] church in in the Dark
[1:17:10] Ages they grabbed this
[1:17:13] book they they took it from all of the
[1:17:15] people all of the the uh common
[1:17:21] people and and only the priest could
[1:17:23] keep
[1:17:26] it and they used this
[1:17:29] word to put people into purgatory or
[1:17:32] take them
[1:17:35] out many many people had
[1:17:41] Crusaders killed many people because of
[1:17:44] this
[1:17:47] word Nations have been conquered because
[1:17:49] of this
[1:17:52] Bible there has been Wars started
[1:17:55] because of this
[1:17:57] word because they misused the
[1:18:02] word but when the word is is
[1:18:07] unadulterated when the word is is comes
[1:18:10] out perfect and
[1:18:13] correctly when you live the word
[1:18:18] righteously it brings forth
[1:18:21] life it br brings forth eternal
[1:18:25] life it'll save that backslider child
[1:18:28] you
[1:18:30] have it'll heal that person that is
[1:18:35] bedridden it'll give you the Holy
[1:18:39] Ghost if you use this word
[1:18:42] correctly life will come forth out of
[1:18:46] it this word and God uses this word to
[1:18:50] judge his
[1:18:51] people
[1:18:59] so I I I think God for
[1:19:02] that I thank God for those
[1:19:05] things and if if there's a a straggler
[1:19:08] that comes
[1:19:11] in somebody that that's maybe not living
[1:19:14] the life
[1:19:17] here somebody that that's that keeps
[1:19:20] falling
[1:19:21] behind
[1:19:24] well it it's it's not my job to judge
[1:19:27] that
[1:19:29] person I don't know who that person
[1:19:32] is I don't know what God's going to do
[1:19:35] with
[1:19:37] them I know they're not living the
[1:19:40] word I know they can't overcome maybe
[1:19:43] their habits or the
[1:19:49] sins but but I do know this that that
[1:19:54] Jesus he
[1:19:56] says that there was one time there was a
[1:19:58] s that sowed good
[1:20:02] seed and at night there became a bad
[1:20:08] s an enemy and he sowed Bad Seed in that
[1:20:13] same
[1:20:16] place and whenever his servants saw
[1:20:20] that he saw the the wheat and the weeds
[1:20:23] begin to grow
[1:20:27] together he they said look it look it
[1:20:31] Master look at I have the weeds and the
[1:20:34] wheat growing
[1:20:38] together allow us to pull it
[1:20:42] out and and the good s
[1:20:45] said he said don't pull the weed the
[1:20:48] weeds
[1:20:50] out because if you tried to pull pull
[1:20:52] the weeds
[1:20:54] out you you have harm of pulling the
[1:20:57] wheat out
[1:21:01] also and what I realize
[1:21:04] there is we don't have the
[1:21:09] authority so who to say who's a wheat
[1:21:12] and who's a
[1:21:14] weed well well hey I I know that person
[1:21:18] that that's a weed for
[1:21:21] sure
[1:21:24] I'm just a
[1:21:25] servant I'm Just a
[1:21:27] Nobody and the Lord says don't do
[1:21:31] it because that might be a potential
[1:21:36] wheat that is my child
[1:21:39] there they might look like a
[1:21:42] weed they they might look like a
[1:21:46] sinner they might look like a
[1:21:49] backslider but watch what I
[1:21:51] do watch my
[1:21:53] power I'm going to change that
[1:21:56] person just like
[1:21:59] Paul they might have to
[1:22:02] suffer they might have to go through a
[1:22:04] few
[1:22:06] things but I'm going to give them my
[1:22:08] Holy
[1:22:09] Spirit I'm going to give them overcoming
[1:22:13] power don't pull it don't condemn him
[1:22:18] don't condemn her because we don't know
[1:22:21] what the Lord is going to do with
[1:22:24] them and if we could stand and the
[1:22:26] musicians can
[1:22:29] come our
[1:22:31] job is only to create an
[1:22:36] atmosphere that's
[1:22:38] it if we can only create an
[1:22:42] atmosphere brother Bram says that's
[1:22:44] where birth
[1:22:46] is he he said the
[1:22:50] chicken is not the one that that Hatches
[1:22:53] the Egg
[1:22:56] out he says you can take that same
[1:23:00] egg and put it under a
[1:23:03] light and that hatch will crack no
[1:23:06] matter what or I mean that that egg will
[1:23:08] crack no matter
[1:23:11] what why it's the atmosphere we
[1:23:15] give and and as we come here into the
[1:23:18] house of
[1:23:21] God because was a
[1:23:24] commandment to not forsake to assemble
[1:23:29] together Lord I I take all my thoughts
[1:23:34] away all of my
[1:23:37] judgments all of my burdens that were
[1:23:39] from
[1:23:41] work all of the things that I'm
[1:23:43] struggling
[1:23:45] with Lord I put it
[1:23:48] aside and I fulfill your
[1:23:51] word it says I give you the sacrifice of
[1:23:54] my
[1:23:57] praise and whenever I do
[1:24:00] that I begin to create an
[1:24:04] atmosphere not knowing that there's
[1:24:06] somebody next to
[1:24:09] me that that is on the
[1:24:11] edge of committing
[1:24:14] suicide on the edge of turning back to
[1:24:17] the
[1:24:19] World on the edge of doing drugs again
[1:24:24] on the edge of not believing this
[1:24:28] word Lord let me create this
[1:24:32] atmosphere so that he will
[1:24:35] know that she will know that God is
[1:24:39] real that it's not a bunch of
[1:24:43] emotions but he's
[1:24:46] everywhere he's there he's
[1:24:48] there he's
[1:24:51] everywhere but but we create that
[1:24:54] atmosphere we create it and whether
[1:24:58] there's a disbelieving
[1:25:01] spirit it will go
[1:25:04] away because God is
[1:25:07] here he's here let us bow our
[1:25:11] heads oh Heavenly
[1:25:15] Father Lord I ask that you just touch
[1:25:17] each and every person
