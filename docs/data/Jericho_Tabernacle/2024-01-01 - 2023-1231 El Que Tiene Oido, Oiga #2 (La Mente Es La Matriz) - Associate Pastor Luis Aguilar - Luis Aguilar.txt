the goal for each and every one of you happy New Years and may the Lord bless each and every one of you our pastor is in El Paso and let's pray for him that he may return with all well now we're going to be going into the scriptures and The Book of Luke 1 and verse 37 and this morning we're going to continue on the thought that we've brought forth he that have an ear let him here and as a subtitle the mind is the womb amen 137 for with God nothing shall be impossible how many of you brought your Bibles today we're going to read it together in Spanish and then in English okay let's do it in English for with God for with God nothing shall be impossible nothing shall be impossible amen let us pray our heavenly father we're here this morning Lord finishing up another year and coming into a new year Lord Nobody Knows the day nor the hour but Lord Jesus Christ give us the strength give us the grace so that when you do arrive [Music] that you may find us doing your will loving one another that you may find your bride dressed with your word help us father as we go reading your word vindicate your word and open up the ears and the hearts and help us to be able to surrender ourselves for we place all these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated I want to thank the musicians he that have an ear let him hear and the mind is the womb and the prophet mentions this and various messages in uh the womb it says that the womb of the Earth the womb of the church the womb of the mind and the womb of the heart so when we say the womb it's also or in Spanish is going to be a little bit different but what I've found or come to realize what the prophet speaks about the womb is that the Earth has a womb the church has a womb and the mind has a womb in the same man the heart also has a womb um and and in this morning we're going to be speaking about the mind sometimes we confuse the mind with our brain but the prophet says that the brain there you find no intelligence and it's in reality your spirit that's within you your intelligence is found in your spirit and your brain is just a bunch of cells and and uh materials but it has no intelligence within itself it's your spirit and the prophet also says that the soul is the nature of the spirit and the prophet says like this the spirit controls the body so when a person has a physical action that represents what's within the spirit because the spirit controls the body and the scripture says that the mind that was in Christ be in you so then when we say mind we're talking about the spirit now we're saying the mind that was in Christ so in other words that the spirit that was within Christ be in you because the mind is the control tower and that is what directs us and the prophet also says that there is a great battle and it's the greatest battle that was ever fought and where is that battle can anybody tell me where in China okay in the mind sorry I'm I'm just a bit far off of from you and it says that so then the greatest battle is within the mind and just as we say that the mind a womb amen how many of you remember that back in the Book of Genesis when Abraham and Sarah coming up to a certain point in their lives they had received the Lord and the two angels and the prophet says that they had turned young again how many of you remember that story that's what the prophet says so if you go to Genesis 20 now Abraham and S and Sarah they go into a uh Kingdom which is called Gerard and the king of that kingdom was the king amalec a very young king and when he came onto Sarah he got fell in love with Sarah and so when they came into the city Abraham told Sarah to say that he is uh his sister who is Abraham a prophet so the Lord and the two angels came unto Abraham beforehand and still he decided to lie and just like we say it it's just a little small white lie and AMC said why did you lie to me well in reality she is my sister from my father's side but not from my mother's side so he did lie but he twisted the truth a little bit and it became a what we call a white Li so then the Lord talked to AMC in a dream and he said you're just as good as a dead man restore that man his wife but he told me that it was a sister and you know my heart and you know my works and that's the reason why I come and stop you so that you don't sin against me and if you remember that the Lord closed up all the woms of the Kingdom I hope that you're following me I'm going to go a little bit slow but even God closed the Ws all of the Ws of the kingdom of AMC so that no life should bring forth how many of you remember that amen it's in Genesis 20 now the mind is the door to the spirit and that's where we find uh the battle the battle and it's in the mind and then if you can help me with the slides and Prophet says like this these battles has raged since the day of the Garden of Eden the battle in the human mind Satan started it what did he do when he met Eve he didn't deny God's word but he whitewashed it so then the devil or the serpent he never denied the word but only whitewashed it he stopped up some of those little channels here so uh here somewhere so then when Satan came to he used his words and began to talk to her and he said so God has said so God has said this in his word so then the serpent never denied what was written in the word but only Twisted it or whitewashed it and then the prophet says like he know the word was right but he know he couldn't just come right out and blast it out blur it like that or BL yeah blast it out or blur it like that but he sugarcoated it so the serpent came to Eve came into the Garden of Eden he never denied or used the different type Bible he didn't use the Mormon bible or the Quran he used the written word so God has said this but also in his word he says but by Grace you are saved so then you can do what whatever you want because here in this Bible that you're saved by grace so then you can live any style of life that you want Satan he only sugarcoated the word of God and so then Eve accepted the incorrect word and so the prophet says now the womb eeve received the wrong seed word so then there's more seed there's not just the the seed of God but we also have the serpent seed so then now we've got to be really careful because Satan also uses the same word and he knows how to preach a very beautiful message so then Eve received the wrong seed word and now the prophet says now listen real close now we're going to drive it down now if the Lord willing she received the wrong word what did it do it was Satan's lie because in uh John 4:48 844 8:44 the scripture says that he is the father of Lies what is a lie a is I'm sorry 1% truth a lie isn't just a 1% truth and 99.9 a lie a lie is a 99.9% of Truth with a 1% of a lie that's a lie a lie has the truth so then when the Devil Comes brings his lie which he is the father of lies he twists the word so then the prophet says like this that the serpent wanted the womb the mind of Eve why because the mind is a womb and in the womb you find the intelligence the intelligence is not in the brain the intelligence is within the spirit because if he could control that mind he could control the body and everything comes by one word the word comes out of the mouth comes in through an ear and comes in through the mind so then that word is is just sounding in the mind no that message is too hard or you could say that message was the truth and each and every one person has a free moral agenc the message is being preached the message is being brought out from the mouth of God and then it goes into the ear of each and every one of you and then where does it go to your mind and then within your mind you can say because when the seed comes goes on to every channel to your reasoning then you might say no this church is a bit harsh when they preach or you could say this is nothing but the truth and you have the right to decide because the seed is the word of God and it's being spread forth on the earth on some in Good Grounds and in other grounds where it does not fall on Good Grounds and so when Eve received the wrong word well the message of the serpent there came and she conceived the uh SE of serpent and the prophet preaches it a little bit more harshen word in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed it says that first of all Satan has to conquer the mind just like the when the young man wants to go and and conquer the young lady he first has to go through her mind and then the Act was done but first of all that devil had to First conquer the mind tell her very beautiful things telling her this that and the other in order to be able to conquer her mind but first it's the mind now if you go into the Book of Luke to chapter 1 we're going to go on to verse 28 this is the part where uh Virgin Mary meets with uh the angel angel Gabriel Angel Gabriel and the Bible says like this on verse 28 and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art Thou highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women so then we find out that there is this young lady here by the name of Mary it wasn't that there was just only maybe five or 10 young ladies City but there were so many of them but there was only one of them there was only one that separated herself from the world and dedicated herself to the service of the Lord and I believe that this was a very tremendous young lady for the angel to come down and speak with her and he said that uh thou are highly favored and then we see on verse 29 and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind uh what manner of salutation this should [Music] be and the angel said don't don't trouble yourself fear not for thou Hast found favor with God because there was a prophecy that a virgin shall conceive and that's something that's way Supernatural and then the angel told her and now you shall conceive in your womb and shall bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus so then we see that the angel came unto Mary and said that you shall conceive within your womb so then she heard the words of this Angel and then in her mind she began to reason and in her mind she could have said I rejected or I accept it I deny it or I accept it so then we go on to verse 34 said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing that I know no man and so in her mind she only thought that she could conceive a son when there is a man and a woman but for God nothing impossible for God he is the supernatural he's not only in the natural so then we see that Mary said on verse 38 we see that she heard the message of the Angel and then within her mind she decied to either accept or reject that message of and what did Mary say uh behold the handmade of the Lord she didn't say no no no I don't want to accept that she said be it unto me according to Thy word to Thy word amen sometimes I feel like running and so then when we see that Mary accepted the message of the after listening after accepting it within her mind and then it came down to the womb of her body and then it began to show that she had Emmanuel within her Elizabeth and then she came across her cousin Elizabeth and she also conceived and had what who was called John the Baptist a man that was anointed by the spirit of Elias but the scripture says that John never moved within the womb of her mother it was just a stillborn baby and that really worried Elizabeth so then Mary goes on to Elizabeth and and just with the greeting that's what the Bible says with the greeting the Lord bless you Elizabeth let me tell you what happened to me the angel Gabriel came unto me and told me that I'm going to conceive a child by the name of Jesus you should be the most high the child of God so then with that greeting with those words the Bible tells us that Elizabeth heard that greeting he that have an ear let him hear she heard the simple greeting of Mary and with that the Bible tells us that she received the Holy Ghost that John began to move within the womb of Elizabeth and then the Elizabeth says that why is it that the mother of the Lord comes unto me that's what the Bible says verse 48 because the word always comes to the prophet even in the womb Jesus Christ came to John the Baptist because the word always comes to the prophet John the Baptist was six months older than Jesus Christ oh how we would want to preach about that even with the simple greeting Elizabeth Elizabeth heard that GRE and she received the Holy Ghost and then John began to move and the prophet tells us uh which one he is not here with a Shar uh look how well dressed she is uh sufficient enough to be able to deceive Luther El Luther the stock Wesley La Wesley the tassel Mary the shock uh the prophet says the shock the womb or Pentecost so then Mary typified three things the shook the womb or Pentecost what's the sh the shu is what grabs or or is hugging the the seed the seed it's not the grain but it's it takes care of it amen because when Jesus was in Mary she took care of him when the time comes when that seed is ready to sprout it releases the seed amen because a woman is not pregnant for 24 months because there comes a time where the baby matures to the point that it comes out and the same thing with Pentecost and then in the other message the things that are to be finally those words of God Anchored In the Womb of the Virgin and she conceived and brought forth Emanuel so then she heard the word of the Lord it came into her mind and then she made up her mind of either to accept it or reject it and she said be it unto me according to th word even though it might have sound ridiculous even though it might have sounded extraordinary or out of this but she had accepted the word and when she accepted the word it fell down into her room and she conceived Emanuel and we also have a womb and we're listening to the word and so this morning you could either accepted or rejected Mary is the shook the womb Pentecost but she is not the seed she is not the grain because Pentecost that's where they stayed they thought that that was the grain the Catholics with all due respect they believe that it's Virgin Mary Virg but it's not the Virgin Mary it's the Lord Jesus Christ that came out of her but there were many that just stayed with vir the mared Virgin but it was only a borrowed womb and then we see that even Mary the prophet says it this way that she denied the word now when Jesus was 12 years old teaching those great Masters and Joseph and Mary left Pentecost they had left the gra they rejected him and then they came back and they said we've been looking for you your father and I and Jesus said know you not that I must be about my father's business Joseph and Mary were not his parents the father is the word the Holy Ghost so then she herself denied the word and that's what the word says in the prophet and then in Romans 10:17 says that faith comes by hearing and the hearing of the word of of the Lord we're going to go into Galatians I hope you brought your swords with you this morning and Ians 3 Galatians 32 here the Apostle Paul it's almost like Apostle Paul is kind of scolding the Galatians because in the first verse it says oh foolish Galatians but in the second verse it it reads like this and very clearly it says it here in Spanish this only would I learn of you and pro the Apostle says I just want to know one simple thing did you receive the Spirit by The Works of the law or by hearing of Faith so did you receive the Holy Ghost by works or by hearing the word of God how did Mary receive Jesus Christ listening to the message of the messenger and I hope you're following [Music] me how did Mary receive by hearing the message of the messenger and Paul said I just want to know one simple thing he's kind of scolding the the Galatians by works because you think you can do this and that or by hearing by faith and verse five he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you does it he do do he it by The Works of the law or by hearing of Faith so then how is it that we receive by hearing by hearing the word of God so how do receive the Holy Ghost by hearing the word and it is very important that we listen to the word now we're going to go over to the Book of Mark Mark 7 14 and here we're going to be doing a bit of a Diagnostics in the heart of man here the Lord Jesus Christ is talking to his disciples and the Pharisees and he read and it reads like this on 7:14 and when he had called the all the people unto him he said unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand what does Jesus say he says listen or hearken there is nothing from without a man that entereth into him that can defile him so then Jesus is saying it very there's nothing outside that can contaminate man but the things which come out of him those are the are they that defile the man and in verse 16 If any man have ears to hear Let Him hear so Jesus is saying that nothing can really contaminate a man that's from the outside but what comes out of the man that is what defiles the man and it shows what's within the man let's see what contaminates the man would you like to see that okay okay if you don't want to see it that's perfectly fine but if you do we're going to take a look at it we're going to go over to the book of Hebrews on chapter 12 verse 15 uh Hebrews chap 12 verse 14 I hope none of you left the beans uh turned on because this is the last service of the year and it reads like this follow peace with all men comma what does it say do you have enmity with every man are you an enemy with everybody no it says to have peace with all men peace with everybody not a group here over here with everybody we're going to read it together in Spanish okay in English follow peace follow peace peace with all with all men with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord then it says that no man shall see the Lord without H but the Bible tells us says to have peace with all men and Holiness without Holiness no without those two things nobody will see the Lord so then ourselves we need two things to have peace with all men and to have Holiness to be able to see the Lord if we don't have peace with all men we cannot see the Lord amen unto his word amen and then verse 15 says like this look diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God then listen really close to this lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled and then the scripture says in the Book of Mark says that whatever is outside of man doesn't contaminate the man but what comes out of the man that is what defiles the man what is a seed it goes into the heart the word of God Is Not the Only there's many seed there's seeds ofit seeds of pridefulness selfishness there's many seeds the serpent seed there's many of and how do those seeds come by hearing what are you hearing did you hear what the associate pastor did he he really ruined over here and over there but what are you listening to and then your mind it goes straight into your mind and then into your heart and then it brings for a root of bitterness what's outside of man does not contaminate me but what's within me and comes out of my mouth that is what contaminates the man do you love God do you love his word that's why the scripture says in verse 14 follow peace with all men that is my brother did you hear what the brother did no be at peace with all he is the best best interpret the best technician we got I don't want to hear nothing evil of him follow peace with all men we have to take that root of bitterness and burn it because without that nobody shall see the Lord how does those seeds come by hearing did you hear what the pastor did look what the pastor's doing you're listening you're hearing something that you shouldn't be is that it where does it come out of the mouth right here and what's within the heart all of that is what contaminates us that is biblical that's message and what's mess what's biblical I'm just like Mary according to Thy word even though it might sound like something that I can never understand let's go into the Book of Matthew Matthew 15 Matthew 15:10 it's the other version of uh The Book of Mark starting in verse 10 and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man so then the Bible is telling me here that the steak is not going to contaminate the shrimp the green chili is not going to contaminate it's not going to be as bad than what comes out of my mouth and then in verse 12 then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying so then took him to the side Jesus the Pharisees they were offended when you preached the word so then not everybody's going to Rejoice some are going to get offended and so the Pharisees were offended then let's go over to the book of Acts let's learn how to use our sword in Acts 7 to verse 51 Steven is a deacon and he's going out to the multitude that wants to kill him and bringing forth a a tremendous message and speaking about Abraham talking about Moses how they came out forth from the red and bringing forth a message to preach that the Lord does not only abide in uh temples built by men but also in in human flesh so then Steven so then he hits the nail on the head look he's preaching and then he says here in verse 51 ye stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do also resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do ye which of the prophets have not of your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which showed before the coming of the just one of whom ye have been now betrayers and murderers uh who have received the law by the disposition of angels so then Stephen is saying he heard that you had received this message by a messenger an angel and you did not keep it he said that you had received it from Messengers and Angels but you did not keep it and then in verse 54 he says so he's preaching and they're they're to the mind and then it goes into the mind and then it says that when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they nashed on him so then they're listening to the word and they're listening to Steven preach and so then when they were hearing the the message being preached by him in their own Hearts they were very Furious and then that which was in them which showed physically and they were nashing their [Music] teeth imagine somebody preaching the word and somebody else I don't want to hear that it's sitting down that's what they were doing here in the Bible they were nashing their teeth by the hearing of the word and they were offended by hearing the word and then we're going to go on to the acts uh chapter 5 5 533 here uh Peter's talking to the council because now now we come to the point that it was very something something very difficult to preach the gospel and then Peter said like this is it necessary to to obey man uh before God in verse 33 and when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them when they heard this not only did they get mad but they wanted to kill Peter and all the apostles because they had heard the word of the Lord so then we're going to go back to the Book of Matthew are you following me brothers and then in verse 13 but he answered every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted [Music] up let them alone they be blind leaders of the Blind and if the blind leadth the Blind and then uh answered Peter and said unto him declare unto us this Parable and Jesus said are ye also yet without understanding do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the drought but those things which proceed out of the mouth come for forth from the heart and defile the man okay uh before it says what comes out of the mouth but then Jesus here explaining the parable in reality it doesn't come out of the mouth it comes out of the heart and then in verse 19 it says for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts so then the heart has thoughts that's where the mind is we have a we have an ear and the word has to come down to our hearts and the prophet says that the only way the only way that we can be born again is by by receiving the word of the Lord in the womb of the mind that's what the prophet says the spoken word is the original the only way to be born again first of all is to hear the word in the mind right here the mind and then you either accept it or reject it and then the spirit comes upon it and then brings forth the life and we're going to explain that in just a bit so then when the serpent came unto Eve he came and preached the word he came to her and preached the word to be able to conquer her spirit to then there take control of her body and right here here uh in closing now I don't know if the brothers have it over here in the slides the mark of the beast your heart is a womb you know what I'm speaking of women and men your heart is of the womb and the womb holds the seed and the seed is the gospel now the seat alone in its heart like the prophet wants to kind of say something here but he doesn't do it no matter how many Galos you sit under and it doesn't matter because you might say well I had this teacher that doesn't matter no matter how great your pastor is and how much you've read the Bible ouch okay okay okay the next one okay okay so then you're hearing the word amen and it comes into the heart but in there it still has no life because it's just just how you plant a seed on the ground it's just they're dormant it requires water okay okay okay just follow me says No matter how much you read your Bible it'll never take life until the germ of life has come to it and we're going to find out what that germ of life is the woman's seed is a wonderful thing it's the building of the body but it has no life okay I'm just going to read it firste a woman seed is a wonderful thing it's building the body but it has no life it can it's impossible it has no life to begin with so no matter how much you know the Bible and how well it is in your heart you're still a sinner Wow Let's go to the next one brother okay right there now what happen the heart is the womb and Faith cometh by open ear that's not been sealed up by theology how much you know he brings it down to the me the the Simplicity of the message the Simplicity because God hides and reveals himself in Simplicity and there's so many that are grabbed by theology that can't that they can't accept the very small simple things faith comes by hearing you take you make up your mind about it is that right could that be right and the prophet says well the Bible said so I believe it wow in proph say w there is the heart of gold so then it's a womb and then the male sex comes we are the bride the woman the seed comes into the church the preaching and then the male sex comes which is the blood of Christ which is then applied and the blood comes in The Germ of life that goes into the seed and brings forth a newborn baby what is the prophet saying here you're the the prophet saying that you got a wom here in your heart you're hearing the word you decide here on your mind whether you accept it or reject if you accept it it's going to be in here you're bringing it down in here it's just like a woman when she is pregnant the baby begins to form but the prophet tells us that it has no life by its own amen amen that's why the prophet say it doesn't matter how much you read your Bible there is no life you may have it here down in your heart you may know the message and you know what you're supposed to do not supposed to do and you know the Bible there will be no life until the Holy Ghost comes and gives you that revelation of this word because when the woman is pregnant she begins to form a the arms begin to develop themselves within the womb there's the word it's being develop it's developing the body and then the prophet says that there's a spirit just going around the woman so that when the baby comes out then the life comes into the baby that's why when the baby comes out it begins to cry and cry because life came into it that's why there are some babies that are born and they do nothing and it's something very sad when he sees a stillborn Bab takes the baby and gives her his spanking and then the baby begins to react and life comes into it because the body is already formed but the spirit has not yet entered it's the same thing with us we have the word we know the message but until the Holy Ghost comes now we have life that's why the prophet says my God my God then someone then you begin to react and realize why did I do these things why did I do these things because now The Germ has taken a hold of the scene and has brought forth life amen amen I'm closing now when Mary was there and the angel came that angel had a name what was the name of that angel Miguel Gabriel Michael or Gabriel Gabriel Gabriel his name was Gabriel what is an angel a messenger and when that messenger came you're going to conceive a child how is that going to be possible so then she accepted the word she heard the word accepted the word and she said like this hearen unto me the the hands hands made of the Lord be done to me according to Thy word she didn't say you know that message is a bit harsh for me no she said I accept this even though that word may sound a little strange how is it possible that a virgin shall how is it possible that my child is going to return return to church how is it possible that I'm going to give because the promises of God are are Supernatural things it's not for the natural it's for the Supernatural and she accepted that message of that angel and she surrendered her body to the word and she said be un to me according to Thy word and in this day there is a virgin and it's the Bride of Jesus Christ she is a virgin that she has not been touched and an angel came what's the name of that angel William maram Bram William maram Bram God never came to Mary he sent Gabriel and in this day God has an angel William by the name of williiam maram Bram he came to the uh virgin and preached the message brought forth the message and the of this day has said be it unto me according to Thy word even though this word I don't not understand it might be a bit but I accept it when I know I'm going a bit over time when Mary uh the angel came she heard she accepted and began to conceive and the prophet tells us that the Lord Jesus Christ is the Original Seed amen amen and she received it without a sensation when a when a man and a woman get together there is a sensation flesh she never had a sensation she had received the Holy G blessed be the name of Lord that's why many people they get so confused that they believe that they have to shout that they have to dance and the Holy Ghost is without sensation she Reed The Original Seed without a single sensation and she herself by her own will to show that she had the Lord Jesus Christ in her and the prophet says that there is a true genuine evidence that you have the Holy Ghost the Pentecost say that you have to speak in tongues and other say that you have to come to church but the prophet says this has never failed what I have said and he said this way it's he that believes every word every word it's not that he's picky that he picks this word yes and this word no but it's he that believes every single word that is the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost and in the in this day we have received the messenger with without sensation please stand and the prophet says this way that the musicians can come up now and the song leader one of the last quotes that I got uh if sometime the the the ways of the Lord are so hard to comprehend for the human mind some might think that they're just really ridiculous and the faith is ridiculous for the human mind it's craziness to many but it's not for God and for those have faith by faith we believe things that our eyes cannot see and our minds cannot declare it only because we believe it the prophet says that reasonings will never be correct so then we cannot reason it or study it this will only confuse our minds there is only one way of doing it and believing that God will be more than able to fulfill that which he has promised and that settles it don't try and then they might say well how is it going to happen we're living in a modern time and take away that from your mind don't even double think it only take him by his word take the decision this moment of what God has said that God can fulfill and it's not my business to know it or understand because if I try to do that I am trying to do it by intellectual planning God does not move by the brains he moves within the heart this and then this the last quote that he says if you're a young woman dedicate your morals I don't know where the young people are the young ladies if you're a young lady dedicate your morals if you're a young man dedicate your moral and the prophet says dedicate your mindate your thinking dedicate your heart dedicate your soul dedicate all that you are and let work through that so then in this year let's not make promises because we're always going to fail the but we never know if it will be our last year and if you're a young man young lady old dedicate yourself dedicate your heart and everything that you are and let's give it all that we got this year and this may be our last year and to be able to say Lord I have done everything that I sang with all that I could that I preach with all that I could that I worshiped you with all that I could Lord I want to leave everything here and I want to worship you with all my heart and dedicate your mind and say
