[31:53] God bless you all this evening
[31:56] it feels good to be back in the house of
[31:58] the Lord once again
[32:01] I haven't been here in a while
[32:04] as you know I just had a baby
[32:09] and it's been a little difficult this
[32:11] last month
[32:13] and I'm also a little nervous this
[32:17] evening
[32:18] I guess I get so nervous I even forgot
[32:21] my Bible in the back
[32:25] how many are happy to be in the house of
[32:27] the Lord today
[32:30] if you please stand with me
[32:33] and we can jump right into the word and
[32:36] say a quick prayer
[32:39] we're going to turn to John 10 10. yes
[32:47] and people say amen when you all have it
[32:55] John 10 10 Juan the SDS and it really is
[33:00] the thief cometh not but for to steal
[33:03] and to kill and to destroy I am come
[33:06] that they might have life and that they
[33:08] might have it more abundantly
[33:20] Lord Heavenly Father we thank you
[33:22] tonight
[33:25] for all that you've done for us up to
[33:27] this point Lord
[33:29] father we ask you take full control of
[33:32] this service
[33:35] may you share some humble words with
[33:37] your children this evening
[33:41] so that we can grow just a little bit
[33:43] more tonight
[33:45] bless everyone here in attendance
[33:50] bless everyone in the invisible audience
[33:52] of the internet
[33:55] it and bless all of our members that are
[33:57] out of town today
[33:59] we place this service in your hands
[34:02] may it all be done for your honoring
[34:05] Glory
[34:06] Gloria in the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:08] Christ
[34:10] amen amen you may be seated Brothers
[34:14] want to thank the pastor in the ministry
[34:17] for the opportunity to be here before
[34:18] you once again
[34:22] I know he's out of town right now
[34:26] but rest assured every time that he's
[34:28] out of town
[34:33] you make sure to watch us the very next
[34:35] day
[34:38] so he is on top of what what is
[34:41] happening
[34:44] once again it feels good to see every
[34:46] one of you once again
[34:50] I haven't I haven't really seen everyone
[34:52] since Camp novice
[34:53] [Music]
[34:55] August was the ninth month of the
[34:57] pregnancy for us
[35:01] and it was a very rough month foreign
[35:52] and it was so awesome how the people
[35:54] that I saw that God delivered
[35:58] you see The Young and the old Belgium
[36:01] just like having those blessings
[36:04] happening to them
[36:06] you're sick they were being healed
[36:09] the slaves they were being free
[36:12] and those doubters that were turning
[36:15] into Believers
[36:19] when I was watching those just from my
[36:21] phone
[36:23] there were so many moments where I just
[36:25] broke down in tears
[36:28] like the atmosphere would just project
[36:30] to me from the phone
[36:34] and if I felt that from my cell phone
[36:38] I can only imagine what every one of you
[36:41] felt being right there in the presence
[36:43] of God at that service
[36:46] so going back to the scripture that we
[36:49] read
[36:52] the scripture says
[36:55] that he has come so that we may have
[36:57] life
[36:58] and and this life what is this life is
[37:02] God's own life
[37:04] it says and have it more abundantly
[37:08] you know and and I don't have a single
[37:11] doubt that there was somebody that left
[37:14] camps
[37:16] Born Again
[37:18] anybody left
[37:21] filled with the Holy Ghost
[37:24] somebody left
[37:26] with God's own life deposited in them
[37:31] and God's life is love
[37:34] God's life is perfect perfect God's life
[37:38] it's Eternal
[37:40] eterno so how can we get more of God's
[37:43] life more abundance
[37:46] the Holy Spirit more abundantly
[37:51] eternity more abundantly
[37:53] if we could compare
[37:55] eternity is like the number infinity
[38:00] or the concept of infinity
[38:04] and science says that there's no number
[38:07] or no quantity within the number
[38:09] infinity
[38:14] so just like God it's never ending
[38:19] science doesn't even know
[38:22] that they know that they're describing
[38:26] that Infinity that they talk about that
[38:31] eternity that they're talking about
[38:33] there's only one that is eternal
[38:36] that is the Lord God Almighty
[38:39] he is the infinite one
[38:42] so to give just a little bit more
[38:44] understanding
[38:46] God gives you the holy ghosts he gives
[38:50] you Faith he gives you godliness and
[38:53] brotherly love
[38:56] and all of this is a part of God
[39:00] it's a part of Eternity
[39:02] it's a part of this Infinity
[39:05] so if I were to have or say I can hold
[39:09] Infinity in my hands
[39:12] and I say brother Luis you know what I'm
[39:14] going to give you a tenth of infinity
[39:15] right now
[39:18] I believe it's uh from one it's point
[39:21] one of infinity
[39:24] well can I give just one tenth of
[39:27] infinity
[39:30] you can't give a fraction
[39:33] because infinity plus infinity is
[39:35] infinity
[39:38] infinity divided by Infinity it's
[39:40] Infinity
[39:44] subtracted Phi Infinity is still
[39:46] Infinity
[39:49] so it will always equal Infinity
[39:53] so to give God give us a fraction of
[39:57] Eternity
[40:01] of his gifts of his Spirit
[40:05] he's giving us all of eternity
[40:09] because the life of God it's Eternal
[40:13] and you've got all of him when he gives
[40:16] it to you
[40:18] but even when he gives it to you
[40:22] since there is no limit
[40:25] and he gave me all of it
[40:27] there's still more to give
[40:30] and there's still more to receive we are
[40:33] still more love together
[40:35] more congratulations
[40:38] because God is eternal he has no limits
[40:42] so when the scripture we read says
[40:46] that he wants to give us life more
[40:48] abundantly
[40:50] to me that is a humongous promise from
[40:53] God
[40:56] because he has no limit to his love
[41:00] there's more to give I'm asking
[41:04] there's more to give
[41:06] in the scripture Philippians 1 6.
[41:12] and I'm certain that God who began the
[41:15] good work within you will continue the
[41:17] work until it is finished
[41:22] foreign
[42:42] in the beginning was a long time ago
[42:47] and then he's the end
[42:50] and even though he's both of those
[42:52] things
[42:54] that still is a time frame
[42:59] is still bigger than the beginning
[43:03] he's greater than the beginning
[43:07] so if we look at a seeds
[43:11] we could say that there's a lot an
[43:14] eternal life in that seat
[43:16] and there's eternal life in the seeds
[43:19] there's
[43:21] eternal life in the trunk
[43:24] in the branches in the leaves and in the
[43:27] fruits and
[43:29] then once again life in the sea universe
[43:38] that was produced in infinite times
[43:40] before que foreign
[44:17] just like someone here tonight
[44:20] they have the potential
[44:34] that seed here tonight has the potential
[44:39] but if we go further than that potential
[44:43] we can tap into that face
[44:47] if you're predestinated
[44:50] you're not a seed a man's seeds
[44:54] you're not a church
[45:00] we're here tonight because we're God see
[45:04] you're not a potential tonight
[45:08] you're a guarantee
[45:11] young people tonight I really want you
[45:13] to believe that yeah
[45:15] I want you to understand that
[45:19] I'm more than potentially a son of God
[45:22] foreign
[47:19] I guarantee probably more than half of
[47:22] you will be
[47:57] the Bible says that we should take the
[48:00] milk of the Gospel
[48:03] at some point in everyone's life in here
[48:08] we were on that bottle drinking that
[48:10] milk
[48:12] and we were getting stronger we're
[48:16] getting wiser who's getting more mature
[48:19] we were growing off that milk
[48:22] but the time came where we grew up
[48:25] and we were no longer babies and it was
[48:29] no longer time for that milk
[48:31] we were gonna get sick and die if all we
[48:34] eat is milk
[48:37] we needed Meats
[48:42] a big juicy steak
[48:47] I'm a barbecue Persona barbecue we ever
[48:51] have some fellowship I'd love to have
[48:53] some barbecues
[48:56] with some big juicy ribs
[49:01] and now if I take my baby girl Hattie
[49:05] you know I can give her right now
[49:09] any kind of food on the planet
[49:13] you can't tell me I can't give it to her
[49:16] if I've grinded up in this make it soft
[49:19] enough she'll eat it
[49:23] up to according to her stature and where
[49:25] she's at in life right now
[49:28] she can't have it yet it's too much for
[49:32] her
[49:33] she can't digest it
[49:37] has been living and walking yes
[49:44] maybe there are some that are still on
[49:46] the bottles
[49:49] but maybe there are some that need to
[49:51] start eating steak but
[49:54] like that stubborn baby
[50:00] it's time for us to grab those blessings
[50:03] and keep walking forward
[50:06] we're talking about the New Birth
[50:09] you just don't got it yet
[50:12] but it's in you
[50:14] Perfection
[50:16] Perfection
[50:20] but it's in you
[50:59] a season where many youth they toss
[51:02] their doubts away
[51:05] a Camp season where they witness
[51:07] Miracles they had a Miracles
[51:11] the Camp season where young people
[51:13] receive the new births
[51:20] were raised
[51:24] people were praising in the voices
[51:26] everywhere
[51:28] and I was
[51:30] he saying it
[51:32] I'm going up yonder to be with my Lord
[51:35] you know how you all looked in that
[51:37] video
[51:40] like the people that believe what they
[51:43] were singing
[51:45] that knew that though they're standing
[51:48] right there in that foreign
[52:03] [Applause]
[52:27] have faith in the experiences that you
[52:55] and it sounded like the Bible to me like
[52:58] when someone encounters Jesus
[53:01] they get in front of his presence
[53:04] and it's so heavy and life changing
[53:07] that you can't help but run and tell
[53:10] somebody
[53:13] like the woman at the well
[53:16] we encounter Jesus we had to run back
[53:20] and tell everybody
[53:25] he went back and tell his friend Philip
[53:27] about it
[53:57] how he got that foot infection
[54:00] and our brother Peter had to take him to
[54:02] the emergency room
[54:05] and to the young people can you imagine
[54:09] what it is that was going through
[54:11] brother Emmanuel's head
[54:14] what kind of thoughts were running
[54:16] through his mind
[54:19] at that moment looking at that feeling
[54:22] those things
[54:25] why do you have to do this why now
[54:30] God what is this a form of punishment
[54:33] for what I did last week
[54:36] where I treated my brother in church
[54:40] the way I treated my kids maybe the way
[54:43] I treated my wife
[54:45] or maybe he was thinking something okay
[54:48] you know maybe I should have been more
[54:50] careful with my health
[54:53] if only I would have watched my diet
[54:57] if only I would have exercised a little
[54:59] bit
[55:00] I would have done this or that
[55:03] you know that that's something that the
[55:05] eyes see
[55:07] what the flesh is
[55:14] the devil trying to get you to think
[55:16] negative
[55:18] plant thoughts of doubt in your heart
[55:21] say it again thoughts of dark doubt in
[55:24] your mind
[55:26] but the spirit in him was saying
[55:51] [Music]
[56:21] you know when everybody was praying for
[56:24] me
[56:25] I knew at that moment
[56:28] I was already healed
[56:34] but brother
[56:36] he get his miracle healing
[56:39] but he got another blessing on that side
[56:43] Domingo his wife or sister
[56:47] she got baptized gave her heart to the
[56:51] Lord
[56:52] so an experience happened at Camp an
[56:55] experience
[56:56] go follow her throughout the week
[57:00] that wouldn't let her go till that
[57:02] Sunday
[57:07] what a knockout punch to the devil that
[57:10] was
[57:13] Lord you did a miracle in my foot
[57:16] but you also did a miracle in my wife
[57:20] you know the devil makes you want to
[57:22] focus
[57:24] on on the circumstances on the hardships
[57:28] that are all around you
[57:30] the things that are right in front of
[57:32] your face
[57:33] you see with these eyes and feel with
[57:35] his body foreign
[58:48] you
[58:51] don't even know the blessing that I got
[58:54] lined up for my son Emmanuel I mean
[58:57] you don't know the blessing right liner
[59:00] for my daughter Hannah
[59:02] you don't know the blessing I have lined
[59:05] up for my son Peter silence
[59:09] my daughter Danielle
[59:12] son daughter because you stood up for me
[59:17] because you walked with me
[59:24] then blessings are coming your way
[59:28] sister where is baptism
[59:32] it wasn't just a blessing for herself
[59:35] it wasn't just for herself
[59:39] and for her four children the greatest
[59:42] gift to a home
[59:45] for two parents to be in one of course
[59:49] be surrender to a living God
[59:59] taking their
[1:00:01] children
[1:00:03] you know young people
[1:00:06] so what do you think goes through
[1:00:07] brother emanuel's mind now
[1:00:10] if I could guess
[1:00:13] I think he's one of the happiest men on
[1:00:15] the earth
[1:00:21] to have experienced another experience
[1:00:26] another experience of Love
[1:00:29] after love after love
[1:00:31] you know God heals out of love
[1:00:35] God Comforts and shows his love
[1:00:39] and God Saves through life
[1:00:43] but God also punishes
[1:00:47] you know young people the devil wants to
[1:00:50] sell you alive so bad
[1:00:54] and he tries to sell it to you at all
[1:00:56] costs
[1:00:58] and it's going to cost you so much to
[1:01:00] listen to it
[1:01:02] then costs you so much to believe it
[1:01:07] God wants to give you his words
[1:01:17] he's not trying to trick you into
[1:01:19] getting it
[1:01:22] no he's handing it out
[1:01:25] not like Satan to deceive you
[1:01:28] like Satan to charge you
[1:01:31] God wants to give you eternal life for
[1:01:34] free
[1:01:36] so young people holding so many
[1:01:40] blessings are coming
[1:01:42] even though the circumstance that you're
[1:01:45] facing right now
[1:01:49] maybe it's difficult at home
[1:01:52] maybe it's difficult at school it's
[1:01:54] difficult maybe you've wrapped yourself
[1:01:57] up in so many things right now
[1:02:00] that you can't find the exit to come
[1:02:03] back foreign
[1:02:33] because he he healed brother Emmanuel's
[1:02:36] foot that's why he serves him
[1:02:40] because uh he healed me of my my
[1:02:43] sickness from a year ago that's why I
[1:02:45] serve him
[1:02:47] no we serve him
[1:02:50] because he loved us
[1:02:54] because he died for us
[1:02:57] he gave himself on the cross so that we
[1:03:00] might have eternal life
[1:03:02] before we could even give love answers
[1:03:06] he was already loving us
[1:03:09] and he wants to give us more love and
[1:03:13] give it an abundance
[1:03:14] peace
[1:03:19] give of his own life more abundance
[1:03:23] you know if you like to turn the second
[1:03:25] second Samuel chapter 22.
[1:03:31] and and down to verse 31
[1:03:35] we're going to look at David here
[1:03:37] everybody knows the story of David
[1:03:41] but there's a lot of fine details within
[1:03:44] the story of David
[1:03:47] there's a lot to read about David
[1:03:51] let's just take this small portion here
[1:03:54] in verse 31 it says
[1:04:00] God's way is perfect all the Lord's
[1:04:04] promises prove true he is a shield for
[1:04:07] all who look to him for protection
[1:04:17] God's way is perfect
[1:04:20] not my way
[1:04:24] David was was an outstanding man
[1:04:32] he was a a a tremendous Warriors
[1:04:36] but he had the Revelation to say
[1:04:40] God's way is perfect
[1:04:45] verse 33 verse God is my strong Fortress
[1:04:49] and he makes my way perfect
[1:04:55] he makes my way perfect
[1:04:58] effect because I can't make my way
[1:05:01] Perfecto 35 says he trains my hands
[1:05:05] excuse me he trains my hands for battle
[1:05:07] he strengthens my arm to draw bronze
[1:05:09] Bowl
[1:05:15] 36. you have given me your Shield of
[1:05:18] Victory your help has made me great
[1:05:26] verse 40. you have armed me with
[1:05:30] strength for battle and you have subdued
[1:05:32] my enemies under my feet
[1:05:39] do you notice a trend in there young
[1:05:41] people
[1:05:43] something that kept happening kept being
[1:05:45] said over and over
[1:05:49] David never said
[1:05:52] I am the strongest
[1:05:55] I am the wisest your soil massager I by
[1:05:59] my abilities I fight foreign
[1:06:58] I'm gonna walk out of there Victoria
[1:07:01] and you know you young people you went
[1:07:03] to Camp foreign
[1:07:57] and he's going to walk you back out
[1:07:59] Victoria
[1:08:01] just trusting God like David
[1:08:04] and through God you will win every
[1:08:07] battle in your life
[1:08:11] but sometimes these battles these wars
[1:08:13] they're all different
[1:08:16] you know some require guns
[1:08:19] others required swords
[1:08:22] some needed planes some needed tanks
[1:08:27] some Wars and battles when it came down
[1:08:29] to it
[1:08:31] it was just some good old fist to fist
[1:08:34] combat
[1:08:36] but trust the Lord
[1:08:38] and some battles today
[1:08:42] in your life are going to require more
[1:08:45] praise
[1:08:47] a lot more praying than you think you do
[1:08:53] I don't want to tell you you need to
[1:08:54] pray a hundred times a day all right
[1:08:56] okay
[1:08:58] but I'll say it like this
[1:09:01] if you can at least start praying once a
[1:09:04] day
[1:09:06] but give God a genuine prayer with all
[1:09:10] your hearts
[1:09:13] that is the more prayer that he wants
[1:09:17] not the quantity but the quality of the
[1:09:20] prayer and relationship you're trying to
[1:09:22] give him
[1:09:26] some battles they're going to require
[1:09:28] fasting
[1:09:30] you know one of the greatest battles I
[1:09:32] ever fought
[1:09:37] I'll never forget that so
[1:09:43] they require more reading of the words
[1:09:47] some battles are going to require you to
[1:09:50] push play a little bit more
[1:09:53] [Music]
[1:09:54] this one might hurt some of you
[1:09:56] rebellious youths
[1:10:00] some of you rebellious older folks
[1:10:05] but some battles in order for you to win
[1:10:10] are going to require obedience and
[1:10:12] sacrifice
[1:10:15] but I think the strongest one of them
[1:10:17] all
[1:10:19] some battles
[1:10:21] and trust in God
[1:10:23] are going to require you to just be
[1:10:26] still
[1:10:29] and let God be God behind the scenes
[1:10:34] but after seeing those Services I know
[1:10:38] there are young people here
[1:10:41] members here they took that theme to
[1:10:45] heart
[1:10:46] you walked with God so therefore you're
[1:10:50] going to mature from that battle you had
[1:10:54] you know brother Brandon talks about the
[1:10:56] three Hebrew children
[1:10:58] how they went into that furnace
[1:11:04] and how everyone when they went in
[1:11:07] they saw that there was a fourth person
[1:11:11] we know brother Brando says that that
[1:11:13] was none other than Jesus Christ
[1:11:17] now just to read quickly in the message
[1:11:20] the reaction to an attack two in action
[1:11:25] says isn't it strange how God does
[1:11:27] things
[1:11:29] he'll let us get right down to the very
[1:11:32] last mile
[1:11:35] he likes to do that
[1:11:38] he did it with the Hebrew children
[1:11:41] knew who he could trust
[1:11:45] he knows that he can trust in you
[1:11:49] so he let them boys walk right up to
[1:11:52] that fiery furnace
[1:11:56] where they could almost smell the fire
[1:12:00] but he never moved
[1:12:02] he will move
[1:12:04] but I'm sorry but but when it comes time
[1:12:07] he will move
[1:12:10] he will move
[1:12:12] but he waits till his own time
[1:12:16] he wanted to see what kind of reaction
[1:12:19] that they would have
[1:12:22] he knew that they had made their stands
[1:12:27] they had made their stands
[1:12:30] those three they walked with God
[1:12:33] they were young
[1:12:50] they walked with God in the trials
[1:12:54] they were still walking with God up to
[1:12:57] their sentence
[1:13:01] Death By Flames
[1:13:04] to burn line ashes in that furnace
[1:13:08] but they still walked with God
[1:13:12] and because they walked with God
[1:13:15] God walked with them
[1:13:18] they stood for him
[1:13:21] he stood for them and because he walked
[1:13:25] in with them
[1:13:27] he made sure that he'd walk out with
[1:13:29] them
[1:13:32] no burn marks no ashes
[1:13:36] no smell of smoke on that body and
[1:13:40] tonight I'm looking at a group of
[1:13:43] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[1:13:46] because y'all walk to that furnace on
[1:13:49] that camera
[1:13:51] that was a hard camp for you
[1:13:54] a Deliverance of healing
[1:13:57] of people being born again
[1:14:01] of people being healed of traumas
[1:14:04] but I don't see a trace of smoke on any
[1:14:07] one of you tonight
[1:14:19] and you know there's only one way to God
[1:14:23] and we know that is through our Lord
[1:14:26] Jesus Christ
[1:14:28] young people we've heard it over and
[1:14:31] over and over again
[1:14:36] but that ain't never gonna change
[1:14:39] because he's the same yesterday
[1:14:43] today boy you know it young people and
[1:14:47] tomorrow
[1:14:49] so it ain't gonna change
[1:14:52] Jesus Christ
[1:14:54] is the way the truth and the life
[1:14:58] and the sooner we can accept that
[1:15:03] is the sooner we can walk more with God
[1:15:07] instead of wanting to make our own way
[1:15:11] to find our own truth
[1:15:14] to do our own lives you know Jesus will
[1:15:18] never walk away from you
[1:15:21] it's us is walking away from Jesus
[1:15:24] he's the chief Shepherd
[1:15:27] you won't lose any that have fallen in
[1:15:30] his hands
[1:15:32] you know you go astray he puts
[1:15:35] everything on pause
[1:15:37] you know that Shepherd didn't say let me
[1:15:39] go take these 99 and pin them up real
[1:15:41] quick
[1:15:44] let me feed them and do my errands with
[1:15:47] them real quick
[1:15:50] because I've got a long busy day today
[1:15:54] he said no I'm going to pin them up
[1:15:55] right here right now
[1:15:58] because one of my sons one of my
[1:16:01] daughters is lost
[1:16:04] my sheep has gone astray
[1:16:07] you know I find it amazing
[1:16:10] because I believe our young people here
[1:16:12] are trying to serve the Lord
[1:16:15] some of them are have been serving the
[1:16:18] lord
[1:16:19] so you're not someone from the world
[1:16:22] coming in
[1:16:24] but you should identify with this more
[1:16:26] than anybody
[1:16:28] because being young is difficult
[1:16:32] and we do go straight
[1:16:34] but a God Almighty loves us so much
[1:16:39] there's a pastor that cares for us
[1:16:43] you go straight he's going to go out
[1:16:46] there to bring you back
[1:16:48] why okay because you're already his
[1:16:52] foreign
[1:17:46] to just walk with God
[1:17:50] why do I need to walk
[1:17:52] how do I walk
[1:17:55] who am I walking with
[1:17:57] who is God when I walk with god what
[1:18:01] happens
[1:18:03] there's so much within just walking with
[1:18:06] God
[1:18:08] read another another quote real quick
[1:18:12] from the message what what is that in
[1:18:15] the hand
[1:18:17] says uh he uh talking about David again
[1:18:21] this is David saying here
[1:18:24] says look here I'm going to tell you
[1:18:27] something
[1:18:28] I've had some experience
[1:18:31] and that's what it takes today
[1:18:34] brother Brown says it takes an
[1:18:36] experience today
[1:18:39] then David said I was keeping my
[1:18:41] father's sheep out there
[1:18:45] and a lion come in and a bird come in
[1:18:49] and they grab that little lamb
[1:18:52] and they run out with it
[1:18:55] and then I run after him and knock him
[1:18:57] on his head
[1:18:59] with this slingshot
[1:19:01] and it started to take the lamb out of
[1:19:03] its mouth
[1:19:05] but then it rolls up
[1:19:08] but then I slew him
[1:19:11] said that God that delivered the lion
[1:19:14] into my hands
[1:19:17] and that bear into my hands
[1:19:21] how much more will he deliver that
[1:19:23] uncircumcised Philistines
[1:19:27] you know David was just a teenage boy
[1:19:30] like a lot of the youth here
[1:19:33] but his experiences
[1:19:35] they taught him how to trust more in God
[1:19:40] it took killing a lion
[1:19:43] which isn't some small docile
[1:19:47] animals
[1:19:49] and mostly that experience helped him to
[1:19:52] kill a eight foot bear essay experience
[1:19:55] but then killing that bear
[1:19:58] gave him the experience he needed
[1:20:01] the trust that he needed
[1:20:04] to be able to kill that 15 foot I don't
[1:20:07] know how tall Goliath was
[1:20:11] and gave him more trust in the Lord
[1:20:14] for the battles to come
[1:20:17] for the wars to come
[1:20:19] but brother Marcos I don't know how to
[1:20:21] fight
[1:20:23] I've never been in a battle before
[1:20:26] you fight just to open your Bible
[1:20:31] you fight just to push play
[1:20:35] you fought just to get to church tonight
[1:20:40] because your eyes and your flesh
[1:20:43] the whole world that's around you
[1:20:47] sometimes friends sometimes families
[1:20:50] familiares is fighting against you
[1:20:53] because it doesn't want you to come to
[1:20:56] church and hear the words
[1:20:59] so it sounds like you do have a huge
[1:21:01] battle you go through every single day
[1:21:06] you know we're coming to an end
[1:21:09] I know we've all heard somebody
[1:21:13] we might have even been that somebody
[1:21:17] that says you know I
[1:21:20] if I wish I just had brother luis's
[1:21:22] testimony
[1:21:24] you know just the way he came to the
[1:21:26] Lord
[1:21:27] you know he didn't step out into the
[1:21:29] world
[1:21:30] God used him since his youth
[1:21:33] you know I tainted my life and I did
[1:21:36] this and that made me testimonials you
[1:21:39] know I've only had a testimony like
[1:21:41] sister Santos
[1:21:43] you know the life that she live how God
[1:21:45] called her
[1:21:47] and having experience like her
[1:21:50] because we hear these tremendous
[1:21:52] testimonies
[1:21:54] how people were saved and converted and
[1:21:56] they received their new birds
[1:21:59] and you know young people
[1:22:02] you know you might look at the minister
[1:22:04] right now
[1:22:05] you see the pastor as he comes in and
[1:22:08] out
[1:22:09] you see our amazing Elders every Sunday
[1:22:13] and you see how consecrated they are you
[1:22:18] see how firm they are
[1:22:20] you see how much trust they have in this
[1:22:23] world
[1:22:25] but you know what it took to get there
[1:22:30] behind the scenes
[1:22:32] was much more than what you see today
[1:22:36] you say I want to be like this person
[1:22:38] like that person
[1:22:41] but the stature they're at today
[1:22:45] the maturity that they're in today
[1:22:48] was because of every single battle they
[1:22:52] had in their life
[1:22:54] that was Battle after battle after
[1:22:57] battle
[1:22:59] you know you can't buy 50 years of
[1:23:01] experience over here at Food City
[1:23:05] you know you can't just go to a grocery
[1:23:07] store and say I want uh 25 years of
[1:23:09] experience
[1:23:15] you can't call the pastor and say you
[1:23:17] know what pastor
[1:23:18] Pastor I just sold my house and
[1:23:20] everything I've got yeah
[1:23:23] you know I I want I want to buy the the
[1:23:26] seven statues of a perfect man from you
[1:23:31] I want to buy my new Birds I want to buy
[1:23:34] that adoption
[1:23:37] no you can't purchase those things
[1:23:46] it's gonna take a season after a season
[1:23:50] and there's going to be battles after
[1:23:52] battles and you're going to grow from
[1:23:55] stature
[1:23:57] you know I heard brother Ryan the
[1:23:59] minister from Sunday
[1:24:01] Ryan and it hit me and made me pause the
[1:24:03] video
[1:24:05] and I don't know sometimes it's simple
[1:24:07] things they hit me so hard because
[1:24:10] maybe it's because I'm so dumb
[1:24:12] I don't read I can't understand
[1:24:17] but brother Ryan said in on Sunday
[1:24:20] he said how can you trust in God
[1:24:24] I don't know if anybody remembers what
[1:24:27] I'm about to say
[1:24:30] how can you trust in a God
[1:24:34] that you don't pray too
[1:24:38] it got me
[1:24:40] I had to push pause
[1:24:43] I said well he's going to be God whether
[1:24:46] we pray to him or not
[1:24:48] he's going to be God whether we pretend
[1:24:51] that he's ours or not
[1:24:54] but how can we trust him
[1:24:57] if we don't have a relationship
[1:25:00] if we don't talk to him if we're not in
[1:25:04] love with him
[1:25:06] if we haven't had intimacy
[1:25:10] so how can you young person
[1:25:14] how can you trust in a God
[1:25:18] that you don't walk with
[1:25:21] I wanted to walk with that
[1:25:25] in order for you to trust that God
[1:25:29] if you could please stand we're going to
[1:25:31] be closing
[1:25:34] the musicians that come forward and play
[1:25:37] something Softly

[1:25:58] and you've won that battle
[1:26:01] you trusted to be healed
[1:26:04] and you won that battle
[1:26:08] you trusted to receive the new birth
[1:26:13] and it was you that won that battle
[1:26:19] but the fight isn't over
[1:26:22] Camp was a battle
[1:26:25] all of September had its battles
[1:26:29] tonight is another battle for you
[1:26:34] but God has given you life
[1:26:37] and how did
[1:27:10] but some young people are listening
[1:27:12] right now
[1:27:13] and other young people will listen to
[1:27:15] this later
[1:27:17] and it was you that received something
[1:27:19] from that campaign
[1:27:21] so hold on to it and just believe it
[1:27:26] because that was your blessing that was
[1:27:29] your Miracles it was all for you
[1:27:33] but prepare yourself for the blessing
[1:27:35] that is going to come next again
[1:27:38] because I'm looking at you here tonight
[1:27:41] and you're not dead yet
[1:27:44] you're not raptured yet

[1:29:20] not paying attention to the right or the
[1:29:23] left hand
