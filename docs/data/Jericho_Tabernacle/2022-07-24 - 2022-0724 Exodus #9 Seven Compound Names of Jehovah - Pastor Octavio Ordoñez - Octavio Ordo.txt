deuteronomy deuteronomy chapter 11 verse 18. therefore shall you lay up these my words in your hearts and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand and that they may be as frontlets between your eyes portanto and you shall teach them to your children speaking of them when you sit in your house i mean when you walk by the way and when you lay down and when you rise up and you shall write them upon the doorpost of your house and upon your gates [Music] it is a sunday service [Music] service del domingo do we have our our insurance uh here this morning so we're going to talk to the children this morning as well as the adults thought [Music] i'd like to clear up a couple of items and and that is the sos if you go to most churches of the message when you look up on youtube you'll find a couple of pictures lived in the late 1800s and passed away in the early 1900s there's also other [Music] paintings of them he was a very well known for paintings of jesus christ now the painting of jesus christ brother abraham said that was a very good likeness of jesus christ now to make it clear we don't worship or we don't pray to any images but i believe it's a blessing to have a drawing or a painting of the lord jesus christ in our building not only that you know it's also good to have it in your home that means the children say well what's that why do we have the drawing or the painting of our lord jesus christ in our home or in our church amen amen there's a reason for that uh are you not a son but not only that but we also have a picture and that's what i want to talk about today this is the sunday school dominical i'd like to speak a little bit of that's a a teaching that you get in high school these are questions that we need to answer for our children or maybe you pray to jesus christ and you worship an image we make this clear and teach it to our children now there's a book written it was written it's called the supernatural natural the life of william branham la villa la vida william branham has anyone uh seen this book algena vistas de libro antes there's six books i says libros and it's a tremendous tremendous help for you if you would read it yes it would be good if you read it to your children and let them know the life of our messenger of the prophet of the hours and how can we use that to help us today in could i ask you a question do you know what year that picture was taken it was taken in 1950 photography and i'll read it to you so we can learn a little bit about this picture this picture was considered the first time in history is a supernatural light struck the lens and it was verified by the fbi if i look it was done before seven thousand people personally it wasn't hidden anywhere something that a big thing was made out of back in the 1950s it was so important to brother branham important that he mentioned it over a hundred times you know the same basis over a hundred times brother abraham mentioned this picture amazing and how it was verified so it's not something to shy away from nos algo de la cual no de vey it's something we need to be proud of something we should know part of our message is and we're not stuck in the old ages behind us there were six other churches but to us what matters is this church i'll read some parts of it it says finally felt strong enough to handle longer campaigns william branham sufficient his manager scheduled him for 17 nights in houston texas to administer programs in houston texas they started with 4 000 people but right away they got full say yeah so they moved to sam houston coliseum houston the second night they moved to sam houston coliseum now the average attendance was about eight thousand people in the second child but there was a baptist minister bautista his name was dr bess is he told his people not to attend those meetings sound familiar don't attend those meetings but so brother fred bosworth a secular man of fred bosworth he brought the newspaper to uh brother branham el trajo el periodically and he said he was challenging them to a debate it is elementa bosworth insisted uh insistia so he said okay go go ahead you can you can debate them they placed it in the newspapers he beat him with one question does anyone remember what that question was oh by the way the the message for today is called the seven compound names of jehovah was a redemptive name of jehovah's so he couldn't answer he asked them one question with one question now seven redemptive names jehovah jireh genesis 24 14 means the lord will provide a sacrifice exodus 15 26 exodus king 76 the lord our healer jehovah nissin giovanni exodus 17 15 and exodus the lord our banner is jehovah raha psalm 23 1 the lord our shepherd jeremiah 26 23 6 the lord our righteousness is ezekiel 48 35 the lord is present is and he also gave him more scriptures i am the lord that healeth me exodus 15 26 in exodus in 76 who healeth all thy diseases [Music] when when even was come they brought unto him jesus and he cast out the spirits with his word healed all who were sick that it might be fulfilled which is spoken by isaiah's the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and and he came back was with the first corinthians dr bess uh started speaking on first corinthians chapter 15. corinthians so he got the camera man take these pictures pointy fingers at the prophet he put a fist under his shin take these pictures well after they took those pictures told the people well i i'm i'm this this uh debate is pretty much done now well we could ask brother branham to come over and dismiss the people uh but as you know he was up there on the third balcony and when he said brother abraham decided to go down to dismiss the people pueblo there's a pretty good note here yesterday he said he felt a blowing wind and he said okay now it's time to go down he said there were 500 ushers putting their hands together okay to guide them down no i don't think there was 500 ushers i believe they were angels of the lord giando see if i can find it encuentro he goes i'm no divine healer i never claimed to be a healer jesus christ is the only healer jesus christ but i will say this this morning i'm sorry but i will say this something supernatural happened the day i was born it was in a log cabin in the backwoods of kentucky the kentucky the little old who didn't have a floor a few minutes after i was born about five o'clock in the morning they pushed open that shutter hey yo in came the light lights circle the bed where mama and i lay okay since then i've learned that it's the angel of god this dentons is it comes into the meetings like a light entra and then i can and then i can see things about a person a persona sometimes about their past and make some sense about their future i challenge anybody anywhere to tell me one time where i have ever made a statement in the name of the lord that wasn't exactly true the way it was moment if the lord the lord jesus christ confirm what he said now that is something [Music] and we should teach it to our children that makes sense to me well the next or that evening they went out to develop the film listen this is really interesting here it was more interesting they developed the the the film uh in the first six pictures photography the first six ages they were all dark yesterday nothing it was taken to the us to the fbi this is what it says here yes the photo of the pillar of fire above william brenham's head was taken on january 24 1950. in the sam houston coliseum in houston texas in the coliseum houston in houston texas george j lacy examined the negative george j lacy examine negative for this photograph and concluded that it was not retouched but above william branham's head enzima de la caveza the william branham was a result of a light striking the negative era brother george j lacy tells brother bradham george j lacy ladies that this picture okay it's a photo will live on after him it'll be available on three cent stores uh estrada but today you can find this picture anywhere find it he told him it was worth about a hundred thousand dollars at that time there's a statement here also that's stating what uh george j lacy thought about this picture do you does anyone know where this photo is today is washington d.c it's in washington dc in the hall of religious art so it stands there today as a witness now this is the opinion of george j lacy is the opinion of george j lacy based upon the above described examination and study examination i am of the definite opinion on definitive that the negative submitted for examination was not retouched nor was it a composite or a double exposed negative further i am of the definite opinion that the light struck light streak appearing above the head in a halo position was caused by a light striking the negative opinion exposition show these books libros to your children i think they'll be blessed from them six books says now we can start our message for today what i wanted to talk about about those seven compound names is then it's up to us to know what those seven compound names are nosotros because we can do the same now as fast as we can now there was a poster before we started there was a poster of brother bradham avian that happened at that coliseum only one message was recorded that's according to the website es conforma alcite internet and the one that was recorded listen to the title the [Music] we only have one other service that was recorded in march 4th 1963 in 1950 in carlsbad new mexico for the first time he talked about the light striking the camera in carlsbad new mexico camera to me these are interesting uh facts [Music] [Music] but later he found out that that city was run down and destroyed maybe not destroyed but dirty okay so to me that's what happens when you reject the word reject the word and you start dying now now let's see what brother abraham says here and why i pray for the sick aura 1954. and here not long ago in houston texas i was taken in a debate in houston where baptist minister came and said that i was a religious fanatic and not to be run out of the city you should do it i wouldn't fuss with them but mr bothwood taking the challenge and that night where thousands of people gathered in the sam houston coliseum they discussed it [Music] just asked in one question that settled it that said was was the redemptive names of jehovah applied he wasn't the lord's provided sacrifice he was in jesus christ the son of god were still in sin and if he was jehovah jireh he's jehovah rapha rafa also because they them compound names is inseparable jesus christ the healer jesus christ the same yesterday today forever so that that just settles it forever for once i wasn't supposed to be there but i was up in balcony 30 wife and brother and i original and the angel of the lord came down uh comments uh and the angel of the lord come said go down 500 ushers put their hands together uh went to the platform i said i don't want to think heart of brother bass but has a right to believe that as a believer he doesn't have a right to to say the bible doesn't teach it because he hasn't got nothing to say now but i said i only testify the truth if i tell the truth so they had to the look life times colors and all those magazines there entonces live times colliers and the douglas studios of houston texas a member of the american photographer association shot the picture houston photographic americana one a catholic and the other one a jew took it in that night and developed a picture to see if it absolutely was authentic and the man had a heart attack when he looked at it the next day it was sent to washington dc copyrighted brought back and they sent and got george or george lacy which is the best unite best in the united states he's the head of the fbi in fingerprint and documents and he kept it in the shell building under observation for three days and called us all in and said who is reverend brenham department of documents like mortal beings but said as long as there there is a christian civilization your picture will live on us i've often said that with psychology too but the mechanical eye of this camera won't take psychology the light struck the lens it was there yes and so the picture now is copyrighted they of course they they sold it and everything else i get it from them give it out just as i get it and one hangs in washington dc in the religious hall of arts in washington d.c as the only supernatural being that's ever it was proven to be right and the critic was beat with one question aren't you glad you believe this message of the hour estimated back to eaton is wrapped in these seven redemptive names the first one being jehovah jireh which means the lord will provide his sacrifice the second one is jehovah rapha segunda the lord the lord is present tense the lord is present is let's review some of these uh while we still have some time number one jehovah jireh genesis if you remember remember genesis 22 is when abraham was going to sacrifice his son in genesis and i'll just go to genesis 22 14. abraham called the name of that place jehovah jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen the lord provided a sacrifice jesus christ is our sacrifice philippians 2 25 and philippensis dos let this mind be in you which was also in christ who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god is but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross matthew 6 33 says but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all things shall be added unto you. amen now let's see what brother branham says about that situation with abraham abraham and when he was ready to obey god to its he cut his hand and said stay your hand abraham and there was a ram hooked in the wilderness around the vines and his horns on top of the mountain where there is lions wolves hyenas jackals and the great ferocious beasts and then he was way up on top of the mountain where there was no water in the mountain abraham had picked up stones all around to build an altar but there was the ram anyhow it was a paradox any man that believes god and takes him at his word no matter what the situation is [Music] the lord has provided himself a sacrifice he can still cause the paradox to happen he can do that this afternoon just take him at his word in exodus 15 22. and this is what led me to this message today exodus 15 22. so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of sure and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water eso del marojo and when they came to mara they could not drink of the waters of maura for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called mara and the people mourn against moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the lord and the lord showed him a tree which when he had casted into the waters the waters were made sweet and there he made for them a situation and an ordinance a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them all and said if thou will diligently shark into the voice of the lord thy god and will do that which is right in his sights and will give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have brought from israel about egypt for i am the lord that healeth is the lord our banner there was a battle going on and moses had to lift up his hands so moses called that place that is [Music] let's go real quick to the next one jehovah shalom in juba shalom we're all familiar with that word the lord is peace lord our peace the lord is peace that's all in judges 26 21. i really like this scripture and gideon noise the biggest grande tallest one he picked a man and with that man he was able to defeat the armies of his time is judges 6 24 and just says then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and called it jehovah shalom unto this day it is yet an opera of the abyssalists to us i like that yes shalom shalom peace espace jehovah rapha salmon the lord is my shepherd we like to read that uh scripture funerals 20 in hebrews 3 17 now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus christ the great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of everlasting covenant jehovah's now in jeremiah 23 6. behold in the days of judah shall be saved in in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness [Music] even as david also describeth the blessings of the man unto whom god imputed righteousness without works saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered is presented it was round about 18 000 measures and the name of the city from that day shall be the lord is there and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give the rest extreme they parallel for word two or three are gathered in his name there i am in the midst of them are we gathered in his name today is and in the redemptive names the lord is present he is the lord's provided sacrifice then he's got to be the lord god present in time of help now if he is here tonight ours he's got to be present tonight for to fulfill the rest of these redemptive names and his presence is super essential he's got to be all all right now he's got to be all that right now he is jehovah he is the lord jesus christ for our time would you please bow your heads for a word of prayer foreign heavenly father almighty god father celestial hear [Music] [Music] you're the same yesterday as you were with moses as you were with brother branham we are such a blessed people to have
