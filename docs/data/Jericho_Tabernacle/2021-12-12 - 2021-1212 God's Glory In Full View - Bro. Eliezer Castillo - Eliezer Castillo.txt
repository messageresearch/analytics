here today the south whiskey programs and i pray that you guys just feel at home amen amen let us go straight to the word uh if you would like to turn with me to second corinthians 3. i was going to read 18 but we'll start at verse 13. and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadflessly look the end of that which was a is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ when moses came back from the mountain and when he came back from the mountain after speaking to god and seen his glory del monte gloria after he received this the ten commandments the second time he came back from the mountain and being in god's glory what was that song the glory is in the house of the lord today after being in his glory gloria he walked down el bajo and that same glory that was that he saw in the image of god gloria was now reflected in him and as he was going down the children of israel saw that glory and it was too great for them to where he had to pull put a veil over his face because they could not see that great glory he is and there's a veil over those scriptures and to this day there's people that cannot see that glory because the veil is over the face amen and uh where was i at 15 it says but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart nevertheless when it shall be turned to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty porque el senor amen now listen to this but we all with open face beholding now open face means the unveil is took it off the veil is took off we with all open face as in a glass the glor behold the glory of beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory unto glory even as by the spirit of the lord heavenly father father celestial lord we just thank you for your presence lord we thank you for your glory glory we thank you for your words lord we thank you that you have allowed us to be here in in your presence that we could worship you with songs and in spirit and in truth lord we sincerely just submit ourselves unto thee this morning lord that you may express just a little thought on your glory and your image lord we thank you we submit all of ourselves each and every person in this building is in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and amen amen amen you may be seated amen my uh title this morning is god's glory in full view is la la gloria de dios i i don't think anything is in coincidence and i just thank god that as walking up here they were singing that beautiful song amen when we i would like to just talk about the glory of god just for a few seconds just so that we can understand what the glory of the lord is whenever we worship the lord whenever uh somebody is preaching when the spirit of the lord uh it just so anointed the believer we can't help but to give god glory to glory we can't help but to praise the lord because of all the goodness that he's done for us we can't help to say glory hallelujah gloria i remember when brother branham spoke spanish just for a little bit espanol it was how he would hear the mexican people say gloria dios uh glory to god gloria dios glory to god how they would give him glory and that's what he remembered of the worship that the people would give him when he would give they would give god all the glory and the honor gloria but but the glory that we see here in the scriptures the glory of god it is that which expresses his nature la gloria whenever you see something that is just amazing and you see it visually you say people you hear people say wow that's glorious and they see it and they say look it at the glory of that city it is an event it's a meeting la gloria the glory of god he said i will come down in my glory el dijo de sendai gloria and the bible says that his glory set down on the mountain and what did they saw [Applause] that was an expression of who god is is god's glory so when god's glory fills this place it's not just a floating spirit esposo every time a king would go out to meet the people his glory was his crown so gloria so what he would do is he would put that glory on his head gloria to show how great he was so how majestic the man was and the bible says that though a woman is a jewel on a man's crown a good woman is a jewel in a man's crown yes she is the glory of a man now today the world is trying to find a virtuous woman the bride a virtuous church a virtuous people but they'll only be one virtuous woman and that is the bride of jesus christ who can find a virtuous woman and he begin to say what she did commence how she would wake up before everybody else how she would go to the markets and she would uh trade and sell and buy comes [Music] and he is known of all he's known by all the elders and all the people at the gates and then after that scripture it continues with the woman and it's showing inestra because of her a causalia because of her glory de la gloria he is known by all people because his house is in order and the bride today is the glory of the husband he is known by the whole world through each and every one of us how do we portray christ today when we're at work how are we portraying god because when they see me they persecute christ because of my uh hypocrisy [Music] and that's how the bride she is the glory of the husband is so that the glory of god may be here so the glory is to make himself known i remember brother branham talking about what reveal means why do we need to see the glory of the lord why do i have to see the glory of the lord what will happen to us with that manifestation that's a question that we we should ask ourselves now i'm using this word glory it's god where god made himself known why was it so important for god to make himself known to the people that's a good question that's a good question to ask ourselves the greatest minds have tried to find the secret of life albert einstein now today we have elon musk elon musk we have stephen hawkings and stephen hawking we have all these great intellectual people personas intellectuals trying to find the secret of life through scientific research through mathematics you know it's as simple as this book all the mysteries that all these people are looking for the secret to eternal life now people are there in their labs trying to find a way to live forever trying to find another place for humanity to live because trying to download our consciousness in in artificial intelligence how did everything how was everything created those are these great big questions people ask themselves questions they could never open these mysteries in this book the mystery of life amen amen what what are the mysteries mysterious what is the mystery quality for me but i mean as simple as it gets for me and i say it with all of my heart it's it's boiled down with three letters god is the mystery of all of it and god hides all the mysteries in all in god has the greatest mathematics you'll ever know there's the greatest technologies in him in him there's great dimensions in god exists is [Applause] [Applause] and it's so amazing to know that we boiled it down to god but that is here and he's over there in africa how he could allow something to live and allow something to die he allows the sun to rise up every morning he is the one that has given me grace to wake up this morning and he was the one that allowed people to pass on in him is the mystery and people try to find it and they'll never they never will they never will because it's in this simple little book in your and great men have have read this bible yet they cannot uncover the mystery amen amen he is the mystery hey listen now god he he's not like us he's not flesh like us if i could say he's not even the pillar of fire if i could say he wasn't that flesh that abraham saw in the tent the bible says in first timothy 1 17. now unto the king eternal portal immortal immortal invisible in receiving the only wise god being honor and glory forever amen he is the great invisible god because i don't believe he's just invisible like we think he is invisible he's just so great that we can't see him brother branham says in christ is the mystery of god revealed the first first thing was that god wanted to reveal himself to the people [Music] now we've got god's very desire is to reveal himself and in revealing himself that's where life comes from that's where healing comes from that's where salvation comes from when he has revealed himself to us that's where restoration comes from from the as the great jehovah who lived who covered all space time and eternity como el grand dios i want you to think of that great big devil that's been tormenting you viens the one that covers all space time and eternity he could not he's too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being ever that never did begin that after you went way beyond a cycle of a hundred of billions and trillions and trillions of light space commons and a great creature that was all that and still is that is our god that goes on from trillions and trillions of light years but in revealing who he is is where life is when god can reveal his image there is deliverance every time god would reveal himself to abraham or or moses he came with a message of deliverance or restoration he appeared to the children of israel the bible says it was the glory of god and and whenever the glory of god appeared they got so afraid that they said don't let god speak to us anymore he's too he he's going to cause us to die and it took a profit to hide him from the people but it takes a profit to reveal him and just whenever just like john the baptist the bible says that he was there to forerun the coming of the lord he was the one to reveal jesus christ because he was him behind the prophets but then it took a profit to stop out of the wilderness [Applause] here you could see the glory of god but it was a stupid shouldered man full of grace and full of glory de gracia gloria brother branham said one time he said man i've always i always thought god was scared of me or i mean that jesus is the very heart of god jesus so when jesus began to walk on the shores of galilee jesus it was god pouring out his heart to the people the fullness of the godhead bodily was in that man it was the glory of god and the bible says there was no beauty that we should desire of him but in him dwelt all the mysteries in him name he was the one that held everything and all the the bible says that the hills and and the the grass and everything shouted for joy when they he was the key to eternal life he was that manifestation or that glory of god but it depends depending on how you see him so there is a manifestation of god manifestation that was jesus christ but then it took part a revelation he went there and preached to the people hundreds and hundreds of people uh centenaries but it took your personal revelations of who he is god's glory can be here the glory of but the veil can still be on our faces where we cannot see the glory of god gloria and it depends on how you see him he says see we can believe in god we could actually believe in the whole bible but the key is knowing where god is at today [Applause] i could praise god because all the good um good scriptures in the bible but where is the word made alive today and that is the revelation yes to know where is god manifesting his glory at today where is the word that we're supposed to see [Applause] every single age even all the way back from adam's moses could not preach noah's message even though noah's message was to took the people out and it was the word of god but that wasn't the message of the day for moses and moses could say oh i believe i believe what noah did moses and whenever he saw the manifested word for that day then it pushed them into a restored state entonces it took them out of egypt they took them through the wilderness they caught the glory of god the image of god for their days the jews they believed all the bible they believed the law if anybody knew the law it was the high priest and and the pharisees but when that word was supposed to be fulfilled it was all fulfilled in that name man named jesus christ they rejected it they rejected that word for their hours they rejected the glory or they rejected the image and that's why that's why you could see that woman that touched the hem of his garment elbow because so many people were touching him and pulling it on him but it was the vision that she had people had the revelation of him being a good prophet but what are those mysteries how are they revealed if you could see the christ in in every step of the bible then the mysteries of god have been revealed to you so but then you go to the man that put a veil over his face and they begin to hit him they were touching the same skin they so they could disrespect it they could do whatever they wanted with it there was no life there no habia because they could not see the veil was over their faces is transformed amen amen amen it takes that you can believe in god i realize we can believe in god actually we can believe in jesus christ but the thing is we leave him there on the shores of galilee we leave them still with nail scarred hands say yes jesus you died for me but he where is he today christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's not over there anymore he's here in the people pueblo the glory of god is here like gloria where is he jesus christ the woman at the well she had such a great revelation because she wasn't even a jew and she was sitting there at the well and the first revelation she got of him was as a man i'm a samaritan and you're a jew yo soy and so he continued to reveal the word to her comments until she says she said one day they'll be one they say it'll be the christ he'll reveal all these things to us he said i am he will be called and then the revelation went greater and greater revelations and when she realized that he was the christ the son of the living god that revelation was the one that took cleaner from all of our sins what revelation do we have today where are we putting jesus christ today are we looking for him way out yonder a castle are we looking for events and times reveals all the mysteries of god and when all the mysteries of god are revealed you can lay claim on them they are yours do we do we understand when we're talking to a brother or sister because the jews missed who jesus christ was christian the rejection of the manifestation of the word but when peter saw him pedro and jesus says who do men say that i am jesus same thing with the progress of revelation men had great great thoughts of who jesus christ was there is a person on this earth that has a spirit of a prophet that has passed on that's a great revelation but it wasn't the revelation that could that revelation could not save them that revelation of thinking jesus christ was a prophet could not heal them upon that the by church is built upon that revelation of who christ is for our days amen amen brother peter he saw him pedro and he got that great revelation but they had three great revelations he saw who jesus was jesus but if if i could be bold enough to say that they didn't see the true great revelation because amen amen and we have to catch that word and whenever they caught it and accepted it just the same way the jews how they handled jesus it's the same way how we handle the word so in martin luther's time when they grasp that revelation of justification when moses saw the glory of god he came down from the mountain and that same portion of the word that was revealed to him it was shining i just i don't have no structure here but was that the full word that martin luther received it wasn't it was just a portion of that word it was just a portion because it only transformed him into a justified statement it was not the full view of god's glory gloria so it was only able to transform them just to a justified state transformation and wesley it was a greater revelation and it transformed them from justification to a sanctified statement because the glory of god opened up just a little bit more gloria the word of god do you understand so when peter saw the flesh the man of the godhead bodily in jesus christ that was only a portion god was in the fullness your system in jesus christ because the bible saw brother branham says all that was in god was poured into christ and all that was in christ amen amen so the fullness of god was there yes god's full presence was there with the bride and is here with the bride presence but he didn't reveal himself fully if he did then they would have been preaching the message that we have today at pentecost all the mysteries of god should be revealed he only revealed himself in portions through justification through sanctification through the uh pentecost justification that was all just portions of god even though his whole presence was there is the prophet had to come and preach a message called unveiling of god when you will receive that fullness of the word what transformation should take place in your life we've already passed justification sanctification and the holy ghost foreign so what should this glory that we see what should it do to us because when we see the glory gloria it transforms us to that same glory lost glory all the way to the image of christ amen amen amen god is so good bueno amen i i have just so much but uh i just don't want to uh to over stay my time let us stand to our feet amen let us bow our heads see performing cleanance heavenly father father celestial lord i ask that you just bless each and every person here father give them what they need lord that is necessary lord we just ask that in this broken up little message we ask that you just reveal yourself to the people father that
