[58:19] Ezekiel 22.
[58:24] we're going to start in verse 29.
[58:31] I know Ezekiel can be a rather deep book
[58:33] of the Bible
[58:38] but uh we won't go too deep this morning
[58:43] let's keep things nice and simple today
[58:47] once more Ezekiel 22 29.
[58:53] and it reads the people of the land have
[58:57] used oppression and exercised robbery
[59:00] and have vexed the poor and needy yea
[59:03] they have oppressed The Stranger
[59:04] wrongfully he said
[59:15] and I sought for a man among them that
[59:18] should make up the Hedge and stand in
[59:21] the gap before me for the land that I
[59:24] should not destroy it but I found none
[59:31] foreign
[59:38] I want to read that again someone that
[59:40] would stand in the gap before me for the
[59:43] land that I should not destroy it but I
[59:46] found none
[59:48] is
[59:56] verse 31.
[59:58] therefore have I poured out my
[1:00:00] indignation upon them I have consumed
[1:00:03] them with the fire of my wrath their own
[1:00:06] way have I recompensed upon their heads
[1:00:08] saith the Lord God important
[1:00:18] we bow our heads for prayer
[1:00:22] Lord Heavenly Father we thank you this
[1:00:24] morning Lord
[1:00:27] for another opportunity of Life Lord
[1:00:31] to where we don't spend it anywhere else
[1:00:34] father
[1:00:36] no sporting events or restaurants or
[1:00:40] anything in the universe
[1:00:43] any of these Pleasures the world has to
[1:00:45] offered
[1:00:48] and it has so many to offer us
[1:00:52] but us that have entered into that love
[1:00:57] just that have entered into that
[1:00:59] Revelation
[1:01:03] into that statue
[1:01:05] we come here unto your house father
[1:01:09] because we want to worship you
[1:01:12] we want to deposit our petitions in your
[1:01:15] hands
[1:01:17] we want to have a communion and a
[1:01:20] fellowship with you
[1:01:23] and we long just to hear from you once
[1:01:26] again this morning
[1:01:30] I ask you father you will speak to your
[1:01:32] people today
[1:01:35] put me aside
[1:01:38] from my interpreter
[1:01:41] and just share some more words of
[1:01:43] edification for your children
[1:01:48] take control of this service we give you
[1:01:50] the honor and Glory
[1:01:53] Gloria in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:56] Christ we pray
[1:01:58] amen amen you might be seated Brothers
[1:02:05] yeah
[1:02:07] I I if I can give a title to this uh
[1:02:09] this this message
[1:02:14] I really wanted to title it standing in
[1:02:16] the Gap
[1:02:20] but uh it felt like it was just so
[1:02:22] similar to the few uh topics we spoke on
[1:02:25] of agape love
[1:02:31] so if we could we'll title it this
[1:02:33] morning agapo love number three
[1:02:39] and as a subtitle standing in the Gap
[1:02:44] and as I was studying I came across the
[1:02:46] description Ezekiel
[1:02:49] and as I was reading chapter 22.
[1:02:53] it's just expressing this this evil
[1:02:56] Wicked people
[1:03:00] so much sin going on amongst the people
[1:03:05] and as we read the last three verses
[1:03:09] I was the guy was searching for someone
[1:03:14] that someone might intercede or stand in
[1:03:16] the gap for this people
[1:03:21] because God did not want to destroy
[1:03:23] these people
[1:03:25] but when he looked out
[1:03:28] he couldn't find anyone
[1:03:30] there was no one there that could or
[1:03:33] would stand in the gaps
[1:03:37] so the Lord had to unleash his wrath
[1:03:39] upon them
[1:03:42] you know I just want to say this morning
[1:03:44] I'm so thankful for his word
[1:03:48] you know every day just the little
[1:03:51] things that come alive to me in my life
[1:03:55] no I know I've heard it my whole life
[1:03:57] but we hear from the pulpit is
[1:04:02] every man's Word is Alive
[1:04:06] God's word is true
[1:04:09] and it's so simple but it's so real
[1:04:13] all things will pass
[1:04:16] but his word shall never pass
[1:04:20] no that tells me that's a very powerful
[1:04:23] word
[1:04:26] it's in like powerful and amazing
[1:04:30] magnificent
[1:04:33] magnifico you know brother Angel can you
[1:04:35] please stand yeah
[1:04:38] now Brothers can everyone please turn
[1:04:40] over and look at our brother Angels
[1:04:43] you may be seated brother I'm sorry for
[1:04:45] embarrassing you
[1:04:48] my word
[1:04:50] wasn't powerful enough
[1:04:54] to get him to stand up
[1:04:57] that was powerful enough for one
[1:04:59] individual yes
[1:05:02] but then my word was powerful enough
[1:05:07] we could say to control maybe 200
[1:05:10] individuals
[1:05:13] but God's word was so powerful
[1:05:17] that he created something out of nothing
[1:05:22] he said let there be light Let There Be
[1:05:25] The Animals the waters the skies the
[1:05:28] birds
[1:05:31] so when I hear that that his word shall
[1:05:34] never passes
[1:05:37] I just think wow what a powerful and
[1:05:40] mighty God that we serve and don't just
[1:05:42] be answer one okay
[1:05:44] you know mankind they're always changing
[1:05:48] the world is always changing and trying
[1:05:51] to get better
[1:05:53] but there's one thing that doesn't
[1:05:55] change
[1:05:56] and that's his word yes it's the same
[1:05:59] yesterday today and forever
[1:06:02] and his man's trying to make the world
[1:06:04] better
[1:06:07] what they think is better with
[1:06:09] modernizing things in technology
[1:06:15] I've noticed they try to also fit God
[1:06:18] into their world
[1:06:22] when God's word doesn't change
[1:06:25] this man that's changing
[1:06:28] they might want to make this liberal
[1:06:30] church or this liberal God
[1:06:35] you know I've even heard of uh well at
[1:06:37] least we have them back in California
[1:06:38] homosexual churches and transsexual
[1:06:41] churches
[1:06:47] nowhere you're going to find that in the
[1:06:49] world
[1:06:51] God's word is the same yesterday today
[1:06:54] and forever
[1:06:57] if anything it's the world that's going
[1:06:59] to change to fit God's word
[1:07:05] when the word says as it was in the days
[1:07:07] of Life
[1:07:09] the world's going to change and it's
[1:07:13] going to change to go and follow that
[1:07:14] word
[1:07:16] because the word won't change
[1:07:19] when it says that men will be lovers of
[1:07:22] themselves
[1:07:24] the world's going to change to that
[1:07:26] point
[1:07:28] to fit the word that was spoken
[1:07:32] the same with when it speaks of wars and
[1:07:34] famines
[1:07:37] even when it speaks of the Dead in
[1:07:39] Christ shall rise first I mean
[1:07:44] the world will change to fit God's word
[1:07:49] and you know I I remember the last two
[1:07:52] times I spoke on Agape of love
[1:07:56] and if you remember
[1:07:58] in the scriptures when they asked Jesus
[1:08:01] Master what is the greatest Commandments
[1:08:07] love the Lord thy God with all thy mind
[1:08:09] with all thy soul with all thy heart
[1:08:14] we all remember that
[1:08:16] and then he gave him a second one
[1:08:19] also love thy neighbor
[1:08:23] that is equally as important
[1:08:26] it's just a significance
[1:08:30] and we explain how in order to do this
[1:08:32] you needed that agape love
[1:08:37] and how this was just a regular love but
[1:08:39] it was a higher love a deeper love is
[1:08:45] now if you notice if you've got this
[1:08:47] agape love in your life
[1:08:50] then you can fulfill these two
[1:08:53] Commandments that he said
[1:08:57] and you know and then all the other ten
[1:08:59] nine Commandments
[1:09:02] you know it's like almost like they're
[1:09:06] irrelevante not that we don't need them
[1:09:09] but we don't have to follow them
[1:09:11] but when you can have agap of love
[1:09:16] all the rest of those Commandments can
[1:09:19] come easily to you
[1:09:22] it's no longer going to be this burden
[1:09:24] or this issue on you
[1:09:28] the struggle that keeps you from being
[1:09:31] able to fulfill those Commandments
[1:09:32] because
[1:09:38] will take charge
[1:09:40] where you can fulfill those Commandments
[1:09:46] it's just pouring through you and within
[1:09:48] you yes
[1:09:51] and you know there's a man in the Bible
[1:09:55] that he was full of love
[1:09:59] within him
[1:10:01] you know Bible scholars say when they
[1:10:04] talk about this man
[1:10:08] he established at least 14 churches
[1:10:13] he had three Mission long missionary
[1:10:16] trips
[1:10:18] no not like going from one state to the
[1:10:21] other and coming back
[1:10:24] but when you go from one land to the
[1:10:26] next
[1:10:28] from that land to the next
[1:10:31] in the next and
[1:10:34] make your way all the way back home
[1:10:41] the biblical Scholars say that he
[1:10:43] traveled over 10 000 miles
[1:10:48] and they say that man is Paul
[1:10:51] you know after Paul had an encounter
[1:10:54] with Christ
[1:10:56] he was never the same in his life
[1:11:00] that one encounter that he had with
[1:11:03] Jesus Christ
[1:11:05] it changed the trajectory of his life
[1:11:10] it changed his beliefs completely from
[1:11:13] what they were to what they became
[1:11:14] foreign
[1:11:38] foreign
[1:12:36] for preaching the same same sermon over
[1:12:39] and over and over again
[1:12:43] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:12:46] Jesus Christ had been revealed to him
[1:12:50] and he had nothing more but to preach
[1:12:52] that revelation of who Jesus Christ is
[1:12:57] and he suffered
[1:13:00] many sufferings
[1:13:02] physical wounds in his body
[1:13:05] emotional wounds
[1:13:08] you know scars on the inside scars on
[1:13:10] the outside
[1:13:12] but every new day where he woke up
[1:13:17] no matter if it was in a prison
[1:13:21] maybe after being Stoned on a hospital
[1:13:23] bed okay
[1:13:27] or wake up in his own bed
[1:13:30] get back up and get on the road
[1:13:35] to preach that same message
[1:13:39] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:13:43] and forever
[1:13:46] that's that word of God that has power
[1:13:49] is
[1:13:52] the power to change any man or woman's
[1:13:55] trajectory in their lives
[1:13:59] that's the power of the word of God
[1:14:03] now the holy ghost that Paul received
[1:14:08] is that not the same holy ghost that we
[1:14:11] received
[1:14:14] or by any means was it better back then
[1:14:19] was it stronger back then
[1:14:22] you know the the power and the strength
[1:14:24] that God gave Samson was it bigger and
[1:14:26] better back then
[1:14:30] no it's the same today
[1:14:33] it's the same Holy Ghost it's the same
[1:14:37] God
[1:14:40] it's just today's been revealed in its
[1:14:43] fullness for US
[1:14:44] foreign
[1:14:48] [Music]
[1:15:00] [Music]
[1:15:04] how much have we really sacrificed
[1:15:08] how much have we really suffered in our
[1:15:11] lives
[1:15:12] no I don't doubt that you haven't gone
[1:15:15] through pain
[1:15:17] I've been through plenty of pain
[1:15:19] I don't doubt that you've had heard in
[1:15:22] your life
[1:15:24] so you've gone through real sufferings
[1:15:27] in your life
[1:15:30] but I've said it before I'll say it
[1:15:32] again
[1:15:34] let suffering produce what it's going to
[1:15:37] produce
[1:15:41] it might sound hard or it might sound
[1:15:43] harsh
[1:15:46] but never should pain
[1:15:49] or any suffering or any hurt that we've
[1:15:51] gotten
[1:15:54] or an offense that's been committed
[1:15:57] toward us
[1:16:00] should ever pull us away from the words
[1:16:05] no pain or suffering you've been through
[1:16:10] should ever strip you away from
[1:16:12] fellowships
[1:16:14] pull you away from the body of Christ
[1:16:18] take you away from that consecrated life
[1:16:21] unto God
[1:16:24] friends should not do that to you
[1:16:29] suffering should not cause that in you
[1:16:32] but then the question will be within why
[1:16:34] does God allow it
[1:16:38] they used this scripture in the funeral
[1:16:40] a few days ago
[1:16:42] and they were saying there's a time to
[1:16:45] weep
[1:16:46] and there's a time to laugh so there's a
[1:16:50] time where we're going to be in the good
[1:16:51] times
[1:16:53] but there's also times where we're going
[1:16:55] to be people are going to offend us
[1:16:59] there's going to be times where we're
[1:17:00] going to be hurt
[1:17:03] there might be long periods of time
[1:17:05] where we're going to Harbor a pain
[1:17:06] inside of us
[1:17:11] but the scripture says all things work
[1:17:14] together
[1:17:16] the bad things and the good things
[1:17:20] they're not working separately
[1:17:23] but they're working jointly together
[1:17:27] and therefore God is the one that has
[1:17:30] allowed your pain
[1:17:32] he's allowed to suffering
[1:17:35] to even allowed the offenses that have
[1:17:37] been
[1:18:04] that we might be able to seal another
[1:18:06] Stepping Stone
[1:18:10] Those obstacles and challenges that are
[1:18:13] placed before us obstacles
[1:18:16] and yes sometimes they're so difficult
[1:18:21] they're so painful and heavy
[1:18:25] let us remember God was the one that
[1:18:28] allowed it in our lives
[1:18:32] you know sometimes the flesh we can be
[1:18:35] so weakness
[1:18:37] you know just a little bit of pain
[1:18:40] a little offense committed to us
[1:18:44] a little disagreement that we have with
[1:18:46] somebody
[1:18:48] yeah for us it might seem hugeot
[1:18:52] we pull ourselves out of the game
[1:18:56] this is like we just step out of the
[1:18:59] race
[1:19:00] you know imagine a boxer
[1:19:04] you know in the meat of the battle
[1:19:08] to run out to the corner
[1:19:12] and start searching for the towel and
[1:19:14] his trainer's back
[1:19:17] he himself can throw it in the ring
[1:19:22] it's ridiculous
[1:19:25] you're not trained for that
[1:19:27] the trainer the whole time yelling at
[1:19:30] the boxer
[1:19:32] those punches aren't hurting you
[1:19:36] can take more
[1:19:43] keep on fighting he's no match for you
[1:19:47] and how ridiculous it would be to see a
[1:19:50] boxer just throw in the town
[1:19:54] the trainers throw in the towel
[1:19:58] our trainer our coach
[1:20:02] we will never throw in the towel on us
[1:20:06] because we carry his bloodline
[1:20:11] his genes his strength his powers
[1:20:15] we will not lose that battle
[1:20:18] so let us be strong
[1:20:21] don't let these things cause us to run
[1:20:23] away
[1:20:26] so make us turn around
[1:20:30] maybe even grow and start growing a
[1:20:33] little seed of bitterness inside
[1:20:57] blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:21:00] for righteousness sake this is
[1:21:06] for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:21:11] you are blessed
[1:21:13] Heaven is yours
[1:21:16] you've been persecuted
[1:21:19] but this is what you're getting for that
[1:21:21] persecution
[1:21:24] it says once again blessed are ye this
[1:21:28] is
[1:21:32] when man shall revile you
[1:21:36] when they purse
[1:21:39] and shall say all manner of evil against
[1:21:42] you falsely
[1:21:46] has anyone spoken all manner of evil
[1:21:49] falsely against you
[1:21:53] spoken behind your back
[1:21:56] is still wrong about your name
[1:22:00] the word says we are blessed is
[1:22:06] the first thing it says is Rejoice
[1:22:10] we can Rejoice for these things
[1:22:14] and now in English
[1:22:16] I like it because it kind of hammers it
[1:22:19] down even more
[1:22:21] if you read up there what it says in
[1:22:23] English and be exceedingly glad
[1:22:27] you know I can think someone doing
[1:22:30] backflips in somersaults and going
[1:22:32] hysterical they're so exceedingly glad
[1:22:39] for gray is your reward in heaven
[1:22:44] is
[1:22:46] for so persecuted they the prophets
[1:22:49] which were before you
[1:22:52] foreign
[1:23:11] I should be rejoicing and exceedingly
[1:23:14] rejoicing
[1:23:17] because great is my reward in heaven
[1:23:21] we got to apply it to ourselves that's
[1:23:23] my rewards
[1:23:26] the Kingdom of Heaven is Mineo
[1:23:30] can we do that this morning and
[1:23:33] and the
[1:23:35] in the message Hebrews chapter 6 number
[1:23:37] three
[1:23:40] may they shake away from their habits
[1:23:45] from their little tempers
[1:23:48] and the things that's been
[1:23:51] and as Paul said
[1:23:54] in the further part of the message
[1:23:59] let us lay aside every way
[1:24:06] that we might run with patients the race
[1:24:08] that is set before us
[1:24:12] looking to the author and finisher of
[1:24:15] our faith
[1:24:18] Jesus Christ
[1:24:20] who was tempted in all manner like we
[1:24:23] are
[1:24:25] without sinning
[1:24:27] he was tempted in all manner like each
[1:24:30] and every one of us
[1:24:33] yet did not sin
[1:24:37] he was permitted to be tempted
[1:24:42] and the key here is but he did not heed
[1:24:46] to the Temptation
[1:24:50] and now for us and we are tempted to
[1:24:54] sinus
[1:24:57] am I the only one tempted to sin so yeah
[1:25:00] I'm in this flesh I'm tempted to sin
[1:25:04] every day
[1:25:05] but it's on me am I going to sin or am I
[1:25:09] noticed he says and we are tempted to
[1:25:11] sin it is
[1:25:17] the life that is within us
[1:25:21] when I read that I think of what life is
[1:25:23] this is an
[1:25:28] eternal life is
[1:25:29] not from this Dimension
[1:25:32] not from a place of time
[1:25:35] him but from an eternal Dimensions
[1:25:38] that life is in me
[1:25:41] and it says it's at the anchor of our
[1:25:44] Eternal destination if you say yes
[1:25:47] that little portion of Eternity inside
[1:25:49] of us is
[1:25:52] what connects us and gives us that hope
[1:25:56] for the Eternal destination outside of
[1:25:59] this Dimension
[1:26:02] and we hold that sacred to our hearts
[1:26:09] you know and I know it's not easy to get
[1:26:11] over pain sometimes
[1:26:15] there's some pain that has taken me a
[1:26:17] really long time to get over I'm much
[1:26:22] we're in the flesh
[1:26:24] it's something that's natural to this
[1:26:27] flesh that we walk in yes
[1:26:30] and I know we all understand that
[1:26:32] feeling
[1:26:33] but if you truly been born again
[1:26:38] you know truly been born again
[1:26:41] because you know everyone in here
[1:26:44] we all look born again
[1:26:48] we talk with each other we sound born
[1:26:50] again
[1:26:54] we act like we're born again
[1:26:57] but the key word is if you're truly born
[1:27:00] again
[1:27:03] then it's when that Holy Spirit is it
[1:27:14] can overcome and take control
[1:27:18] it can get in the cockpit of that plane
[1:27:22] and take control of our lives
[1:27:25] and overpower the Flesh and the pull
[1:27:28] that it gives us
[1:27:33] if I ever have to love
[1:27:43] you know the only way I can do so
[1:27:48] is if God gives me the strength to do so
[1:27:53] you know we're not trying to perform a
[1:27:55] lip service
[1:27:58] we don't want to just say it with our
[1:28:00] mouths
[1:28:02] and just say it with a Smiles
[1:28:05] but we want it to be something real
[1:28:07] inside of us
[1:28:10] and I know that if and when it gets hard
[1:28:16] and you know genuinely inside of us
[1:28:20] that we really want to make things right
[1:28:25] and we really want to love that
[1:28:29] Persona and the key word is we genuinely
[1:28:32] want to love that person
[1:28:37] sometimes it is too difficult
[1:28:40] you know but we have somewhere to go for
[1:28:42] help
[1:28:44] sometimes that battle of the flesh it is
[1:28:47] too strong
[1:28:50] I want to love my brother
[1:28:52] then I can say to God
[1:28:55] you know Lord I'm struggling so much
[1:28:59] but God I need your help
[1:29:03] I know that we've been going through
[1:29:05] this issue
[1:29:06] I know that I have this Strife with my
[1:29:09] brother or sister
[1:29:11] the Lord help me to Love Like You Love
[1:29:14] Me
[1:29:18] my spoken word like I said in the
[1:29:20] beginning
[1:29:22] they controlled everyone in this room
[1:29:26] and if I have a portion of God
[1:29:30] and I speak that word
[1:29:33] no matter how much my brother Emmanuel
[1:29:35] offends me
[1:29:38] if I speak the word Lord give me the
[1:29:41] strength to love my brothers
[1:29:45] he will give me that love so that I can
[1:29:48] give back that love
[1:29:50] is
[1:29:54] you know but we need to be careful
[1:29:57] no these pains and offenses
[1:30:00] the hurts that we go through
[1:30:05] they can become a justification
[1:30:10] they can turn into an excuse in our
[1:30:13] lives
[1:30:15] for an excuse for our conduct
[1:30:20] an excuse for our bitterness just
[1:30:25] justification as to why I've been so
[1:30:27] distant
[1:30:31] because brother you just don't get it
[1:30:34] you don't understand what I've been
[1:30:36] through
[1:30:37] if you knew you know why I don't come to
[1:30:40] church anymore
[1:30:43] if you know what happened to me you know
[1:30:45] why I don't go to Fellowship anymore
[1:30:49] if you know what my family suffers
[1:30:54] if you know what my husband went through
[1:30:56] what my wife went through
[1:31:00] it's a justification
[1:31:03] it turns into an excuse
[1:31:06] because this pain after this pain after
[1:31:09] this pain
[1:31:11] we're just justifying the bitterness
[1:31:14] that has been growing inside of us
[1:31:20] the devil is good at his job in
[1:31:25] I don't know if folks like to hear that
[1:31:26] or not
[1:31:28] but I got to be honest
[1:31:30] he's really good at his job
[1:31:34] he's not like me
[1:31:37] sometimes I sleep on the job
[1:31:43] if I don't have enough haircuts in the
[1:31:46] day
[1:31:48] I'm just a little bored
[1:31:51] I fall asleep
[1:31:53] I could be out on the streets trying to
[1:31:55] get more haircuts
[1:32:00] for them to come to the barbershop
[1:32:05] do something to stay on the job
[1:32:10] but instead I go to bed
[1:32:13] but the Devil he's not sleeping when it
[1:32:15] comes to us
[1:32:18] he's on the job 24 7.
[1:32:23] how can I separate them from
[1:32:38] how can I get this husband to fall into
[1:32:41] uh to to fight with this wife
[1:32:46] no he's constantly working
[1:32:50] and then the devil can trick us
[1:32:53] to get into a place where we start to
[1:32:55] nurse those wounds that we've been going
[1:32:57] through
[1:33:01] I was trying to explain to my brother
[1:33:03] Emmanuel in the back and I pray that I
[1:33:05] can explain it right now
[1:33:10] but we'll like nurse our wounds that we
[1:33:14] carry escape
[1:33:16] and and it's like it's for a single
[1:33:19] purpose in our life
[1:33:22] because we love the attention that
[1:33:46] when our brother Edward Jackson came to
[1:33:49] this church for the first time Edward
[1:33:51] Jackson
[1:33:52] there were brothers right away they
[1:33:54] tended to him and listened to him and
[1:33:56] heard his struggle and his sufferings
[1:34:02] because they're genuine Christians they
[1:34:05] want to show that love
[1:34:09] but we can get so obsessed with the hurt
[1:34:12] and the pain in our lives
[1:34:18] that we just can't get over it
[1:34:21] it is like a fear on the inside of
[1:34:25] foreign
[1:34:32] [Music]
[1:35:25] when those memories and those traumas
[1:35:27] come on
[1:35:30] some of those things that we have that
[1:35:32] happened to us before serving God
[1:35:36] and
[1:35:37] some this happened since we've been
[1:35:40] serving God
[1:35:43] we can now tap into that
[1:35:49] and then defeat that pain
[1:35:53] because that will heal our hearts
[1:35:57] we don't need the compassion of anybody
[1:35:59] else
[1:36:01] I don't need psychologists and
[1:36:04] counseling in your yours
[1:36:11] because that's what they do out in the
[1:36:14] world
[1:36:16] I need Jesus Christ
[1:36:19] God is my eternal Comfort dioses
[1:36:23] he's the one that will bind the
[1:36:26] Brokenhearted
[1:36:29] and we've got a wave of brokenhearted
[1:36:32] people
[1:36:35] some with little hairline fractures
[1:36:40] and somewhere that whole glass is
[1:36:42] shattered from edge to edge
[1:36:47] but he's here to bring Liberty unto the
[1:36:50] captain
[1:36:53] let that agape love heal you this
[1:36:55] morning
[1:36:58] let it restore whatever is pulling you
[1:37:00] down in your life
[1:37:05] in the message
[1:37:10] he came to the Earth he said he suffered
[1:37:14] as a man
[1:37:15] he was he was tempted in all manners
[1:37:18] like we are
[1:37:21] without sin he became a perfect Kingsman
[1:37:25] redeemers
[1:37:29] he suffered in his body
[1:37:32] he bore our infirmities
[1:37:35] and in his body to take it away
[1:37:39] and he come down
[1:37:41] what is it case God condescending coming
[1:37:45] down
[1:37:47] you know I think I can safely say that
[1:37:50] no one has suffered more than Jesus
[1:37:55] no one's hurt more than Jesus is hurt
[1:38:03] but can you imagine
[1:38:06] if we gave the same time
[1:38:10] into the same amount of time and
[1:38:12] attention
[1:38:15] that we give to the pain and the hurt
[1:38:17] that's been inflicted upon us
[1:38:22] if we gave that same amount of time to
[1:38:25] the pain and offenses we've Afflicted on
[1:38:27] others
[1:38:32] the times where we might have said
[1:38:34] something to somebody
[1:38:37] we offended somebody
[1:38:39] you know spiritually or physically
[1:38:42] and what if we knew about all the times
[1:38:45] we don't know about
[1:38:50] I think if we gave the equal amount of
[1:38:53] time
[1:38:55] to that pain not the one given to me
[1:39:00] but the one that I've given out
[1:39:03] I think we'd reevaluate the pain that
[1:39:06] we've suffered
[1:39:09] I think we look at things just a little
[1:39:11] bit differently in our lives
[1:39:15] maybe there's someone this morning that
[1:39:17] can say
[1:39:19] in your mind in your heart
[1:39:22] you know I remember this one time
[1:39:24] foreign
[1:39:28] [Music]
[1:39:53] and now I want this person to make
[1:39:55] things right with me
[1:39:59] I would say to myself
[1:40:01] I do say to myself
[1:40:04] Lord help me to truly love my brothers
[1:40:10] to truly love my sister foreign
[1:40:25] no
[1:40:26] no I think I'm barely getting into the
[1:40:28] message now
[1:40:30] forgive me but I want to get to the
[1:40:34] point in my life
[1:40:35] in my Christian walk
[1:40:38] where even no matter what type of
[1:40:41] offense I get okay
[1:40:44] you know and it's a tough one
[1:40:47] I know that he's wrong
[1:40:50] he knows that he's wrong
[1:40:53] and all of you know that he's wrong
[1:40:57] but where I can say
[1:41:00] God forgive him
[1:41:03] for my sake
[1:41:05] Lord forgive him for myself
[1:41:09] where we can make an intercession
[1:41:15] we can stand in the Gap
[1:41:18] where we can love someone with that
[1:41:21] Agape
[1:41:24] for their forgiveness but
[1:41:37] so that we can have peace
[1:41:41] it doesn't take the other person to make
[1:41:43] it right
[1:41:46] it takes you to get in consecration with
[1:41:49] God
[1:41:51] and you intercede for your brothers
[1:41:55] we might have the spoken word
[1:41:58] we can stand in the Gap
[1:42:02] and we can make that thing right
[1:42:06] we I believe his brother Eli said we
[1:42:08] hold the power of healing in our hands
[1:42:14] so why can't we put it to you
[1:42:17] know Lord help us all right
[1:42:21] because it's difficult
[1:42:23] and if there's anything I I want to get
[1:42:26] away from
[1:42:28] it's fake forgiveness
[1:42:31] you know where we say
[1:42:34] I forgive you
[1:42:36] or we you know I forgive this person I
[1:42:38] forgive that person is
[1:42:41] and once again I'm speaking to myself
[1:42:44] universe but every time something
[1:42:47] negative happens
[1:42:50] so my brother my sister whoever the
[1:42:52] person is
[1:42:54] you know there's there's like there's
[1:42:56] something inside of you
[1:42:58] they might be thinking
[1:43:02] well you know brother Emmanuel kind of
[1:43:04] had it coming
[1:43:07] you know something inside of me gets a
[1:43:10] little bit of a satisfaction that that
[1:43:12] thing happened to him
[1:43:17] there's the you know to see him hurt to
[1:43:20] fail himself
[1:43:24] maybe we're so prideful or maybe we're
[1:43:27] just so religious
[1:43:29] that we can't say it with our mouths
[1:43:33] but it's speaking loud and clear inside
[1:43:35] of our hearts
[1:43:39] how we're actually just a little happy
[1:43:41] when somebody else gets a little bit of
[1:43:43] suffering in their life
[1:43:48] I'm just trying to be honest here
[1:43:51] I enjoyed brother Johnny speaking on
[1:43:53] Friday
[1:43:56] he was just trying to be honest
[1:43:59] and speak from his heart
[1:44:01] and you know we're all waiting for a
[1:44:04] Rapture
[1:44:05] and we claim to be Rapture Ready
[1:44:08] [Music]
[1:44:12] with faith say you know I'm ready for
[1:44:14] the Rapture I'm going to be ready for
[1:44:15] that Rapture
[1:44:17] is
[1:44:20] funny I heard a brother say it like this
[1:44:25] and speaking about the Rapture
[1:44:27] he said you know I'm not going to get a
[1:44:30] body change until
[1:45:31] I think it's time that we put our Petty
[1:45:34] doctrines aside
[1:45:38] and I'm not talking about big things
[1:45:41] like uh the return and no return
[1:45:46] the seals or all these things
[1:45:50] some of these doctrines are so simple
[1:45:53] yes like I got my own doctrine of where
[1:45:56] I need to sit in church
[1:46:01] I got my own doctrine of how where I
[1:46:04] need to park in the parking lot
[1:46:08] my own doctrine of what days I'm willing
[1:46:11] to come to church
[1:46:14] these are Petty doctrines
[1:46:18] we need to make sure we can get rid of
[1:46:20] those things
[1:46:23] so we can really love our brother or our
[1:46:26] sister is
[1:46:33] thing if it's so strong and so powerful
[1:46:37] that is pulling me away and more away
[1:46:39] from my brother Emmanuel
[1:46:42] then something's wrong there
[1:46:44] maybe it's his Doctrine maybe it's mine
[1:46:48] but whether it's his or mine
[1:46:51] I know what I can do
[1:46:54] I can't stand in the Gap I can love my
[1:46:58] brothers I can put my doctors aside
[1:47:01] and say you know what maybe I don't
[1:47:03] understand you brother
[1:47:06] but I'm gonna try and look at things
[1:47:08] through your view and I'm just gonna
[1:47:09] love you
[1:47:12] and maybe God will reveal it to both of
[1:47:15] us
[1:47:17] you know can it be possible that my
[1:47:21] hurts and my beliefs
[1:47:23] yes you know can they be greater than my
[1:47:26] love
[1:47:27] many times it is
[1:47:30] because we feed it and we feed it and we
[1:47:32] feed it
[1:47:35] and then before you know when we see
[1:47:37] we're so distant from God
[1:47:41] it's been so many years since we've had
[1:47:43] fellowship with our brothers
[1:47:48] been so long since we've even stepped
[1:47:50] foot in the church
[1:47:54] and it's been pulling us away little by
[1:47:57] little
[1:47:59] but something's got to change
[1:48:02] that's something can change today
[1:48:06] we can stand in that Gap foreign
[1:48:34] how are we going to make it there in
[1:48:37] heaven
[1:48:39] can we truly say I'm going to be there
[1:48:42] and smile at my brother's face
[1:48:46] when I can't smile at him on a Sunday
[1:48:49] morning
[1:48:51] I'm not speaking to anybody I'm speaking
[1:48:54] to myself
[1:48:56] the book of Galatians chapter five
[1:49:01] if we bite and devour one another
[1:49:06] take heed or else you'll be consumed of
[1:49:09] one another
[1:49:11] there was another version of the Bible
[1:49:13] that went a little more Savage with the
[1:49:15] reading
[1:49:19] it says take forgive me it says beware
[1:49:23] of acting like uh what did it say raging
[1:49:27] animals he said
[1:49:33] kill each other the scripture wants to
[1:49:36] compare us to Savage animals when we
[1:49:38] enter in that state
[1:49:41] animals
[1:49:42] it's a danger zone when we enter into
[1:49:45] those contentions and dissensions with
[1:49:47] our brother and sisters
[1:49:56] then he says in the very next verse but
[1:49:58] walk in the spirit
[1:50:02] and do not fulfill the lusts of the
[1:50:04] flesh
[1:50:07] don't be like a wild animal
[1:50:10] like her brother was saying don't go
[1:50:12] after I don't want a brother was pouring
[1:50:14] his heart I don't want to uh live by the
[1:50:16] fruits of the flesh but I want to live
[1:50:18] by the fruits of the spirits
[1:50:24] the same here I want to walk in the
[1:50:26] spirit
[1:50:29] you know in the book of Exodus uh
[1:50:33] in chapter 32
[1:50:36] you know there's someone here that stood
[1:50:38] in the Gap
[1:50:40] and it's tremendous because how we can
[1:50:43] see two sides to that agape love of God
[1:50:45] yes
[1:50:49] just skimming through if you started at
[1:50:52] verse 17.
[1:50:55] this is a Joshua heard a noise
[1:51:00] and and they were shouting and then Mo
[1:51:02] and and he went unto Moses because he
[1:51:04] thought it was a war in the camp is
[1:51:09] you know and Moses was saying it's not a
[1:51:12] voice of War but it's it seems like
[1:51:14] they're they're singing they're they're
[1:51:16] having a party over there
[1:51:21] you know and when they went down they
[1:51:23] saw that there was a golden calf
[1:51:26] they were men men and women dancing all
[1:51:29] around
[1:51:32] probably all these Pagan and disgusting
[1:51:34] worldly dances and worship to this cast
[1:51:41] it says that Moses was Furious in his
[1:51:44] anger
[1:51:48] he took the calves
[1:51:50] he says he burnt it to the fire
[1:51:54] grounded down to
[1:51:57] powdered and then he mixed it in with
[1:52:00] water
[1:52:02] he was so angry
[1:52:05] so angry that he made the children of
[1:52:09] Israel drink it
[1:52:12] that same thing they were worshiping
[1:52:15] that what they were indulging in that
[1:52:18] pleasure and that that immorality
[1:52:23] grinding it down sit now you drink it
[1:52:29] and now if you jump down to verse 26.
[1:52:33] she said Moses then he stood in the gate
[1:52:36] of the camp he says
[1:52:39] who's on the Lord's Side
[1:52:42] if you are common to me
[1:52:46] get on this side
[1:52:48] and all the sons of Levi gathered
[1:52:51] together
[1:52:54] then the prophecy
[1:52:56] or he prophesied forgive me
[1:52:59] thus saith the Lord God of Israel
[1:53:03] so this is now God speaking through him
[1:53:08] a punishment that was going to happen
[1:53:11] upon the people
[1:53:14] I should say a chastisement
[1:53:17] for correction
[1:53:20] go out and from gate to gate throughout
[1:53:22] the entire
[1:53:25] campaign and slay every man his brother
[1:53:29] and his companion and his neighbor
[1:53:33] anything that's exactly what they did
[1:53:35] and three thousand men died
[1:53:39] what a what a horrendous thing that
[1:53:42] might have been that day
[1:53:45] these brothers that they grew up with
[1:53:47] that they loved they had to slay them
[1:53:52] because we have a jealous God
[1:53:56] Thou shalt have no other gods before me
[1:54:01] they couldn't wait and hold themselves
[1:54:03] if they started serving another God
[1:54:12] that the very next day
[1:54:15] Moses had said you all have sinned a
[1:54:19] great sin
[1:54:21] Gran pecado but now I need to go with
[1:54:24] the Lord
[1:54:26] I'm gonna make an atonement for your
[1:54:29] sins
[1:54:31] I'm gonna go stand in the cap for your
[1:54:34] sins
[1:54:36] it sounds like he was repented
[1:54:40] he was sorry he was feeling
[1:54:42] compassionate
[1:54:44] because he knew they needed to be
[1:54:47] chastised
[1:54:49] but the other part of God's Agape Love
[1:54:54] Is that reconciliation
[1:54:56] is that restoration that atonement
[1:55:01] Moses went unto the Lord
[1:55:04] and how he says unto God
[1:55:07] these people they've sinned a great sin
[1:55:10] he said
[1:55:13] I would ask if you would please forgive
[1:55:15] their sins
[1:55:19] I could imagine he was in tears and
[1:55:21] crying out to God
[1:55:25] to the point where he even says and
[1:55:28] block me out
[1:55:32] take my name out of the book
[1:55:36] let me be the one to cast this cast
[1:55:39] their sins upon me
[1:55:42] don't judge them don't punish themes
[1:55:46] even though they did wrong okay they
[1:55:50] broke a direct Commandments
[1:55:53] but I'll take the blame for them
[1:55:57] I'll be the one to send the atonement
[1:55:59] for them
[1:56:02] Moses carried out judgment
[1:56:06] but the very next day
[1:56:09] there was mercy and there was Grace
[1:56:12] Brown says it was a spirit of Christ
[1:56:15] within Moses
[1:56:18] even though judgment and Grace had to
[1:56:20] come okay
[1:56:22] they were equally an expression of the
[1:56:25] love of God
[1:56:30] Moses was standing there in the gap
[1:56:33] and you know just for question purposes
[1:56:38] in the Book of Psalms
[1:56:41] 106. and verse 23. it says therefore he
[1:56:46] said that he would destroy them
[1:56:52] so because of what they did
[1:56:55] the sin that they committed
[1:56:59] God would have destroyed them all
[1:57:04] Moses chosen to stand before them in the
[1:57:08] breaches
[1:57:12] how one man could stand in the bridge
[1:57:17] for a nation of millions
[1:57:20] the God's Wrath wouldn't fall upon
[1:57:22] Millions for just one man
[1:57:28] the god would turn his wrath and not
[1:57:30] destroy them
[1:57:33] he stood in the breach for them
[1:57:36] but God needed someone to deliver that
[1:57:39] people
[1:57:41] because that was his word he would
[1:57:44] receive a deliverer
[1:57:46] the spirit of Christ would come before
[1:57:49] Christ even stepped foot on this Earth
[1:57:57] and love is eternal and his spirit is
[1:58:01] eternal and though it came in this year
[1:58:05] when it came out of Eternity to go into
[1:58:08] Moses
[1:58:11] it did the exact same thing that Jesus
[1:58:13] came to do for us
[1:58:21] the wrath of God and his punishment
[1:58:24] would not fall upon us
[1:58:28] but that we can have forgiveness because
[1:58:33] one person could stand in the Gap
[1:58:37] and you know we're standing in the Gap
[1:58:39] today as the bride
[1:58:42] judgment hasn't struck the Earth because
[1:58:44] we're still here
[1:58:48] which means you can still be that one to
[1:58:51] stand in the gap for somebody else
[1:58:56] and many times we apply it to someone
[1:58:58] out in the world
[1:59:01] it can be so simple as somebody inside
[1:59:04] your family
[1:59:07] remember we can speak the word
[1:59:10] remember we can stand in the Gap
[1:59:14] remember it's just simply Agape agape
[1:59:20] Psalm said God would have destroyed them
[1:59:27] the word says that God will destroy the
[1:59:30] Earth
[1:59:32] but there can be select individuals that
[1:59:35] can be saved if we can stand in the gaps
[1:59:43] we're going to be closing if you don't
[1:59:45] please stand yeah
[1:59:47] musicians can come forward
[1:59:51] in the book of Acts
[1:59:53] to close with this story here
[1:59:56] we have Stephen
[1:59:59] and we talk so much about Stephen
[2:00:02] in chapter 7 verse 51 in El Capitol
[2:00:07] says Stephen was here talking
[2:00:11] or better yet he was preaching
[2:00:14] with the conviction
[2:00:17] you stiff-necked and uncircumcised in
[2:00:19] your heart and ears you always resist
[2:00:21] the holy ghosts
[2:00:28] he wasn't beating around the bush he was
[2:00:31] getting right to the point
[2:00:34] you you which persecuted the prophets
[2:00:37] you and your fathers
[2:00:43] and now your betrayers and you're all
[2:00:46] just a bunch of murderers
[2:00:51] you've received the law but you don't
[2:00:52] even keep it
[2:00:54] for this position
[2:00:56] and what happens when they were hearing
[2:00:58] these things
[2:01:00] they cut their hearts
[2:01:03] it struck them in a bad way
[2:01:08] says and being full of the Holy Ghost he
[2:01:11] looked up steadfast into heaven
[2:01:16] he saw the glory of God
[2:01:19] and he said I see the heavens open
[2:01:23] and the son of man standing on the right
[2:01:26] hand of God
[2:01:28] and they cried out with the loud voice
[2:01:32] the others they're the ones listening
[2:01:36] and they ran up to him
[2:01:38] and they cast him out of the city
[2:01:42] and as we all know they began to Stone
[2:01:45] himself
[2:01:47] the witnesses then
[2:01:51] says the Bible says that they lay down
[2:01:52] their clothes at a young man's feet
[2:01:56] and that young man happened to be Saul
[2:01:59] yeah
[2:02:06] and they stoned Stephen the Bible says
[2:02:10] and you know what he says next
[2:02:14] it says that and he called upon God
[2:02:19] and he said Lord Jesus receive my spirit
[2:02:24] we knew what time it was in his life
[2:02:29] he knew that he was at the end of the
[2:02:31] road in his life
[2:02:34] Lord receive my spirit
[2:02:38] as he's being stoned Elizabeth but the
[2:02:42] very next scripture
[2:02:44] says that he cried with the loud voice
[2:02:48] you notice the difference here
[2:02:51] he knew he was going to die
[2:02:55] so he said take my spirit
[2:02:58] maybe with the soft voice
[2:03:02] maybe just in his heart
[2:03:04] but this next part here
[2:03:14] lay not the sin to their charge is
[2:03:19] don't blame them for what they're doing
[2:03:24] don't punish them for what they're doing
[2:03:28] he said it out loud
[2:03:31] screaming so that everyone in attendance
[2:03:34] could hear
[2:03:36] and then he died
[2:03:39] you just got done preaching the entire
[2:03:41] Bible to these Pharisees
[2:03:46] and they got so jealous that they wanted
[2:03:49] to kill him
[2:03:52] but God is still God yesterday today and
[2:03:55] forever
[2:03:59] Place some Valiant Soldier to stand in
[2:04:02] the Gap
[2:04:06] even if it's to the death
[2:04:10] when he shouted that out
[2:04:13] everyone heard
[2:04:15] everybody heard but that might have just
[2:04:18] been for one person to hear
[2:04:23] that was so that Paul could hear
[2:04:26] because he had a mission upon his life
[2:04:30] there was a calling upon his life
[2:04:33] and if if Stephen had not said those
[2:04:38] words
[2:04:41] who knows what would have happened to
[2:04:43] Paul
[2:04:45] but we did read
[2:04:47] that if God if Moses would have not
[2:04:50] interceded
[2:04:52] those people would have been killed by
[2:04:55] God
[2:04:57] but Steven into interceded just like
[2:05:00] Moses
[2:05:02] without even knowing who Paul was
[2:05:06] and said don't lay this sin upon their
[2:05:08] charge
[2:05:10] so the Paul could be free of that sin
[2:05:13] foreign
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:28] and you didn't do nothing about it
[2:05:30] he was there and he didn't do anything
[2:05:32] about it
[2:05:34] and was equally at foreign
[2:05:48] please close your eyes
[2:05:50] I'm just going to read this last quote
[2:05:52] before we pray
[2:05:56] it says now we're all going to make
[2:05:58] mistakes
[2:06:01] but just remember
[2:06:04] when you're looking out at one another
[2:06:08] don't look at that person's mistake
[2:06:11] see don't do that because remember
[2:06:16] you make mistakes
[2:06:19] but look to Christ who is guiding this
[2:06:24] Persona and if they need some help
[2:06:28] and you just pray for them
[2:06:31] that's the way that we get along
[2:06:35] you see praise
[2:06:39] when you're praying for somebody else
[2:06:43] that's in that kind of a fix
[2:06:48] God will honor dios and heal you
[2:06:53] God will honor and heal you
[2:07:06] that's what Christianity is based upon
[2:07:09] Christian to help one another
[2:07:13] do for one another
[2:07:16] be kind to one another yes
[2:07:23] and if you see your neighbor's mistakes
[2:07:27] you see where they've went wrong
[2:07:31] don't go wrong with them
[2:07:34] but just pray for them
[2:07:36] just keep praying and God will
[2:07:40] understand that
[2:07:42] and God will make everything right
[2:07:46] Lord Jesus we thank you today Lord Jesus
[2:07:50] gracias
[2:07:51] father we just want to please you this
[2:07:53] morning
[2:07:56] Lord give us more of your gospel love
[2:07:59] this morning
[2:08:01] then maybe we might have understood
[2:08:03] today
[2:08:04] that we make plenty of mistakes
[2:08:09] and we've offended many people
[2:08:13] but I don't need them to make it right
[2:08:15] with me Lord
[2:08:18] I can stand in the gap for them
[2:08:22] because just like he has I have the same
[2:08:25] desire
[2:08:28] to see you on that great and glorious
[2:08:31] day
[2:08:33] where we can meet up in the skies
[2:08:38] so father through that love Lord
[2:08:41] help me love my brother and sister more
[2:08:44] and more
[2:08:45] yamas that I can continue to love them
[2:08:49] every day more and more and more
[2:08:59] and I might have given a bad face to my
[2:09:02] brother here on this Earth
[2:09:04] but I want to love him here like I'm
[2:09:07] going to love him up there
[2:09:10] but the only way I can achieve that is
[2:09:14] through your love
[2:09:16] so father together
[2:09:19] may we all stand in that Gap
[2:09:22] all right Believers and members of this
[2:09:24] church
[2:09:26] as Christians
[2:09:29] as Christians in this state in this
[2:09:32] country Lord
