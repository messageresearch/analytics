morning we sing it with revelations lord i want my own day at calvary and someone this morning will have their data and i believe it with all my heart the audio in the back part and the sisters that play up here in the front the deacons trustees and god bless everyone our pastor and associate pastor that are in the missionary work may god bless them like brother eli and brother marcos may the initial reading just will be one scripture then you can be seated we're going to go to the book of second kings it's in the old testament and we're going to go to chapter five second kings capitol chapter five this morning i'll be short i'll be briefed because in my heart i i felt the leading to give someone the chance to come to the altar you have to make it on your own on your own every one of us this morning we're going to be reading second kings chapter five and it was so when elisha the man of god had heard that the king of israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore has thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in israel with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of elijah entonces and elijah sent a messenger unto him saying now play pay close attention he says go and wash in jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be cleaned up once again he said go and wash in jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean let us pray heavenly father without you we're unable to do anything that's a simple fact we are able to prepare things on our own we can bring things of our own but without your help we yield ourselves to your will this morning with that we're signaling that we're surrendering to you this morning so therefore in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you and you may be seated said something that really caught my attention he says we have this will be the second one usually i don't continue in a series of numbers because i just briefed uh quite often because the last time that i was here i spoke about david and the giant and i also spoke about god's numbers and then another parenthesis uh the spoken word that's why i i repeat it what brother says because that's something that i have in my notebook the spoken word this morning to have faith if you have faith no i'm not impossible then there's nothing impossible no i'm not impossible there's nothing impossible if you simply manage to have documentation that documentation and we always carry it with us the sisters have their purses they always have their purses with them [Applause] faith can take over you no i'm not like and there's nothing that you're unable to receive if we can just simply look to cause forever gloria and glory to his name there was a general from syria that came he was a good man and the king of syria he loved him and he treasured it but he had something in him he had leprosy but that king he loved him and cherished he can and he reached the doors where elisha lived but the king he wrote him a letter and then first he sent him to the king of israel and the king of israel is a bit upset [Applause] i close let him come now to me let him now come to me elisha knew he had authority as a u.s ambassador then all the power of the u.s backs me up the decisions that i made the us backstage we are his ambassadors this morning [Applause] a man that is fully surrendered to god a man fully surrendered to the will of god ask all that also he is powerful glory to his name yes bothered also that that's the way it is and he said to peter oh what great promises he's given to his church and blessed be the name of the lord so we're here now brothers we have come with the need every one of us has a [Music] and when the serpents were biting the people he says make he was the number one killer that was waiting for his own execution he knew that his time and his moment was approaching and he would hear the soldiers that were approaching himself he said within himself this is it my day has come you go miora and my hour has come barabbas my time has come up they're going to execute me they're going to kill me but when they got there the soldiers roma the roman soldiers open and you know what they said you're free they say that's a barabbas stop leaving you're free this is my appointed time for me to be killed and executed why are you saying that i'm free is this morning we should be so happy and joyful because he could have regretted but he did it he said it my brother said when he went down and he was praying his grief was so heavy the bible says that he sweat when they sweat when it was dropping to the ground it was if it's possible to let this cup pass over me but thy will be done and he did go to calvary for me he gave his life for you and i also say he gave his life for you and died and not only did he do that if we simply and there was people that were in front of him behind him and below as soon as he and he's not even finished and how many believe that i can use this card to travel to the other i don't want i want to see your hands if and he did so many things while he was foreign is i was waiting and i was going to ask the sister how did it go when she went to the hospital and this morning she gave uh thanksgiving she gave her thanksgiving [Music] he will not abandon you we're the ones that live here we're the one that abandoned him but he's not going no he will not forsake you the other day someone mentioned it and someone said it this morning [Applause] restore the joy of my salvation when was the last time you ever cried when was the last time you were just laying on the rug or on the floor [Applause] when was the last time you had to use handkerchiefs and tissues when was your last time this morning you're able to do that [Music] five different times it's something that we have established he was fishing one time [Applause] and we know what happened to the little fish lopez and he says give that little fish his life and we know that that's what happened then the lord spoke to him about the squirrels that was the second las ardigas the squirrels number three the third i'm speaking to people that have already read it and if they haven't read it they'll have the desire to go and read it blessed be the name of the lord then we have sister hattie wright that really uh caused my attention harry right sister hattie wright she said the right word after brother branham began to talk about the things of god she said the right word it was a woman the fourth time was a woman and when she said the right word and those is it's something that he can give you this morning he's the same yesterday he's the same today and he's the same forever gloria glory to his name so brothers and sisters ask for you have a sister that's a paralytic it is poverty you're poor it is poverty you're poor he mentioned three things yes and she began to think and think she didn't know what to ask ask what she didn't ask she didn't ask money for herself she asked need if if that isn't it he can hear him and this morning i tell you with all my heart then that can help us to say lord if i need faith give me faith and glory to his name through the messages how is it that the people when they had a need to go through for [Music] i think this message he preached in shreveport louisiana fernandez sister fernandez they're our brothers and sisters that have their little computer don you and whenever they hear when it was preaching the year that it was previous they are able to find it it was preached on november 26th 1965 how did brother mccues know that brother branham was going to be on a hunting trip i don't know i don't go into details but i'm sure brothers that he already had heard el hue patrol in california he was a sponsor in california for one of uh brother bananas for many years he was a pastor in tucson arizona and i had the privilege to be able to talk he was in denver colorado he preached for me one night and i spoke with him and i asked him hermanos brothers and sisters i had heard and listened trip and notice what it says and he said brother mchugh said brother bro does the angel of the lord ever appear to you when you're on these hunting trips yeah i said brother mccube yes that's right yes it's right blessed and i just looked around and i seen a doctor looking at his eye how many suffer with eye trouble i've had eye trouble when you are no longer seeing through the glass which is awful bright and sunny in arizona and i looked at it and i seen a doctor tell him sir i've been doctoring that ear for years she said for years and he says two years they say us he says you're going to lose your eyes it that was his doctor speaking but remember we also have a dog and his name is jesus we have a he took them and then he brought them back and now they're here praising the name of our lord blessed be the name of the lord in paragraph 55 he says i look back [Music] and i see him standing there with no glasses in the vision i said thus saith the lord god healed your eyes and he was your mother too and also healed your mother and remain and let that spoken word be a reality for you isaac said to abraham his father when he received the command to go and isaac was taking the place of our lord jesus christ you're going to notice that many times many times and many years will go by you know i don't know how much is going on and i don't know how many have already gone go to mount moriah and offer up your only sentiment your only son he could have said so many other things but he said nothing about his son was dead taking the place of our lord jesus christ he said because if it's your wealth but late your will be done isaac didn't know that it was him abraham didn't know he just simply answers his father and he says and he said son the lord will provide now did he do that did he do it god tested his face god wants to test your faith this morning how many are willing to get them out on that card glory to the name of the lord may god help us in blessings let's pray if you can please we're going to make it an altar brothers and sisters that need something from god [Music] if the musicians play something soft we're here this morning giving a chance because you gave every one of us a chance when daniel curry reached the other side he got there because his life on earth had ended and he got to that place [Music] and he asked them who are you what's your name dijo soy daniel curry and he answered my name is daniel curry daniel curry i'm the evangelist daniel curry and i've led millions of souls to christ but now my life on earth has ended and now i have nowhere to go just think on that and says well let me check if your name is written here and after looking for it they told daniel curry your name is not written there no esta

that our name is written your he says you can make an appeal to the great white throne judgment so he began to travel for like an hour and as he was getting closer the that light that was there was getting closer and it was shining brighter and as he got to that place [Applause] there was a voice that came from and said were you perfect on the earth for us that are here think about that were you perfect on earth and he said no second pregnant the second question were you sincere with everyone the third question was did you say everything truthfully when you were on the earth no he said no it's because he was before a very bright light number cuatro and the fourth one tomas de algona the fourth one is did you take something that was something that wasn't yours he says yeah most likely i did say uh take something away and when i was waiting for that light to come and annihilate me i heard then a sweet voice a voice that's sweeter than the voice of a mother for her children that said
