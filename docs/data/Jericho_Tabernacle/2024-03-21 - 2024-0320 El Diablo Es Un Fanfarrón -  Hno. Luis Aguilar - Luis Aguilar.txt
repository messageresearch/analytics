come to this place with a single purpose in mind and that is to Worship the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you be so kind to open your Bibles in the book of 2 Corinthians [Music] amen and every one of you looks really good amen 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse 7 and before we read the scripture let bow our head so we can approach the author of the word our dear Lord Heavenly Father we find us here we find ourselves here tonight with a single purpose in mind that is to worship your holy name now father we pray that those of us that are here present we pray that you can help us to be able to receive from your word for we come here knowing that we need from your word and that word will correct us that word will motivate us and that very same word will give us life now father we're opening the Bible but father we pray that you spiritually open the Bible to us so that we can understand it we thank you for everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen 2 Corinthians 6 verse 7 it says by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the [Music] left by Honor and dishonor by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet wellknown as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things amen may God bless the reading of his word you may be seated [Music] amen we thank our musicians and our pastor and to each and every one of you as well amen now tonight we have a thought that we would like to express and we want to give the title The Devil is a bluff amen how many knew that that the devil is a bluff let's all say it together so we can tell the devil that he is a bluff we'll say it in English first in Spanish then in English fonon amen the devil the devil is a is a bluff Bluff amen amen Brothers how many understand that that's very easy to understand now the prophet preaches a message to us which he calls it possessing all things the prophet brought us a very a message that's highly important and sometimes we can see that God's people are bound by the very devil and you believe that the devil carries the power and we in one point in our lives we believe him to be Almighty I'll say it again in a point in our lives we have believed him to be the almighty because everything goes bad for us we think or we feel that the devil is closer to us than God that he's the only one that hears us out and God barely could hear us but tonight we would like to remove the mask off the we want to remove all power that he has because the only Power that he has is the power that the church gives to the devil I'll say it again the prophet tells me and I don't know how is it that you read your message how you read or how you understand the message but the prophet tells me that the church gives its power to the devil so who is the church then it's them that are called out it's not actually just a building is not a crowd of many people because the called out is few how many understand because when the people people left Egypt the multitude left Egypt many people left Egypt but Egypt did not come out of their hearts it was very few people that Egypt left their hearts even denomination itself was in their hearts the wrong does were were inside them they were Bound for so long that they were accustomed to being bound they were not accustomed to being free so when they saw the wonders of God they they could not accept it they couldn't take it in they would turn it down or reject it and tonight I want to say that the devil is a bluff and I don't know what you're struggling with in your life many of you are in different levels many are maybe struggling with their own youth they may be struggling in their own marriage maybe you're struggling with your children with your own health or with your thoughts but the Devil is a bluff the only Power the devil carries is the power that we give to him amen brothers and the prophet says I don't have the quotes on the screen and the message possess possessing all things he says Abraham he says was aired to All by the promise so he could lay claim to everything that was in the land in the land itself Abraham had been given the promise now we understand that Abraham was the poorest man in all the country what a thing God gave the promise to Abraham that thy seed will possess the enemy's Gates but we see that Abraham perhaps was the poorest man that was in the desert but he lived in peace with God and lot Rich lived in the city and become the governor of the city he said in the gate he was a judge and judged the city he had and had all the riches and things but Abraham was in the desert and perhaps the poorest man in the land and yet a claim to possess all Phoenix Arizon you might not be the wealthiest people here in Phoenix Arizona but you have the claim to possess what belongs to you maybe we don't have that much riches but we have the right the claim to possess what belongs to you so tonight we might not be rich in the uh worldly Goods but yet we possess all things the church itself possesses all things yet poor get rich and possesses all things and tonight I want your faith to begin to be stimulated I want that faith that is in you to begin to stimulate because maybe you have a child a son or daughter that is veering off the things of God or maybe your own marriage is not in the things of God maybe your home is falling apart but tonight we want to possess what belongs to me the Devil is a bluff uh brother vam says that Abraham's cattle maybe he was hungry maybe it wasn't the most uh the biggest cows but yet he had cows maybe they were very thin but yet he had cows but on the other hand lot he had the best piece of land maybe Abraham was had a shortage of water and the days were very hot for him and brother Adam says that as well the Shepherds of Abraham had Strife it seemed that all things were going against Abraham and yet with all that he still owned all the land are you hearing me he was the poorest one his cows were the thinnest ones but he still owned all the land now the prophet says in the first seal that there was a rider there was a white horse so when uh with the prophet once the revelation of the seven SE came the people thought that that white horse and that Rider they thought it was the Holy Spirit but when the Revelation comes and the Holy Spirit reveals that it was not the Holy Ghost it was the Antichrist because the Antichrist is very similar or looks like Christ the things of the devil they look very alike to the things of God they hear good they sound good but they're not from God when we see that that uh Rider had a bow and when the Revelation came the prophet says that that riter he had a bow but he had no arrows and he says that Antichrist was a bluff he had a bow just merely to scare off the children of God the Devil is a bluff he has a bow like today he might have a shotgun but he he doesn't have any bullets at all because we possess all things you know that yeah we even us not only do we possess our families our healing but the prophet also tells me that we also possess death how many uh knew that I'll read it for you in the very same Mage the prophet says he says did you notice uh that Paul said here in the Corinthians he said even of death is subject to us now think of that we have power over death yes sir that encourages us he says uh I forgot about that explosion of the gun now see why didn't Satan kill me why because he couldn't that's why God wasn't ready he could come as much as he want to but he can't take you are you listening the devil cannot take you until God gives him until your purpose in this life is fulfilled all the apostles the Apostle Peter the rest of the Apostles they had a purpose that they had to meet on Earth and everyone wanted to kill the apostles but they couldn't kill them until their purpose was met the prophet says he cannot take you though he wants to but he can't take you says I paid my debt to that a long time ago when I believed on Jesus Christ who's alive forever more he says now death listens to what we say Amen death listens to what we say Amen how many times have we prayed for someone that is sick and we say Lord give them a little bit more of time maybe it's just another more year but death listens to what we say now the prophet says that's what Paul said here in Corinthians death even we possess it why when they was fixing to cut his head off he said oh death where is your sting where is your show me where you can scare me D said I'll squeeze you down and put you down in the grave and you'll rot and caner he said but all thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ I possess it all because death hell and Grave because he conquered it all for us we are possessors of everything we possess all things and many people are afraid of death I believe that's a very tremendous thing that people are afraid of death but maybe they just don't know know the message but the message clarifies so many things for us it reveals to us and it tells us what happens when a Christian even a person that does not believe in God what happens to them after death and the prophet tells us that death is like a buggy and death is tied to a buggy and the only thing that death can do is take you to the presence of your maker death is a bluff death no longer has a St and now death looks like a big ghost and many maybe many of you at one point in your life you've confronted death maybe you have cancer or or a crash or I I don't know but maybe uh many few of you have had to face what death is and uh brother Adam says that death in itself carries a fear and as as death is approaching you but now the prophet says death no longer has a sting because when the Lord Jesus Christ came the devil just thought that the Lord Jesus Christ was merely just another prophet he thought he was just merely another man so when death came to Abraham death caught Abraham and locked him up when death came to job it caught him and locked him up so death itself was an overcomer but once it came down to the Lord Jesus Christ even John the Baptist sent disciples when he was in jail and he said go ask him that this one that we're looking for and like the devil said if thou be the Son of God then turn these stones into bread he wanted to tempted he wanted to see that creative power from God he said if thou be the Son of God cast yourself from these Heights because even the devil quoted the Bible because the Bible tells us he says he will not let your foot Dash against the stone the devil wanted to see Firs hand if this was in fact the Son of God even the Lord Jesus Christ could not be tempted and when death Came Death approached him it's something normal for a human being to have to be a little scared because even the Lord Jesus Christ said Lord he said Lord let this cup pass over me but he said but let thy will be done not my will but thy will be done he began to sweat was nervous because he knew that he had to face death itself death carried a sting but when he was at calvary's Cross and then death came and stung him death then said this is not a normal human being this is not a normal prophet this is not just a man and when the Lord saw death he said death I will be your death what amazing words those were because when Abraham Came Death just said this is just another prophet and put him into Paradise then job came he killed him he put him in Paradise Daniel came Ezekiel came they were tremendous prophets but when the Lord Jesus Christ came he was the only one that can look death face to face and he said death I will be your death you no longer have power you are a bluff so death no longer has it power so what the Lord Jesus Christ did he took death he grabbed him from the sack and he put them in he took them and put in the buggy just like the horse just like when you uh you connect the horse to the to the buggy then you get on the buggy that horse will take you to your destination that horse is death death cannot do anything for a child of God that accepted the Lord Jesus Christ in his day you just get on the buggy you sit down there and death only will take you to your maker when you're face to face with your maker what are you going to then say to God what are you going to say to God then each one of you ask yourselves Lord I stood for your word I stood next to your pastor serving your church Lord what are you going to say when death takes you to your maker that's an amazing question but death a Son of God a child of God should not fear death because it no longer carries a St that's why Paul knew he said death where is your sting grave where is your Victory amen the prophet tells us he said Abraham had a claim to all things and the promise is yours yet he had to fight to possess it he had everything Brothers but he had to fight his your daughter your son your marriage your life your home they belong to you God gave them to you you must fight for them amen he was heir of all things air of all spiritual blessing every physical blessing every blessing the bible promises yeah you have to fight every inch of it that's the way God's got it set up it's always been that way you have to fight to possess you have to fight to possess it now you say brother brandom I need healing but if you ever get to if you ever get it you ain't going to get it easy if you ever get your healing it's not easy to get your healing what the prophet said there is very tremendous he says I assure you of that you're going to have to take it away from Satan he says Satan captures your health he says you've got a right to go to Satan say give it back hand it over I come in the name of the Lord the possessor of heavens and earth and I am his Heir give it back you took my child you got her mixed up with the wrong boy you took my boy and mixed up with the wrong girl I claim them I claim my children I claim my brother I claim my sister yes Satan you took them from God's House Co them out of there but I'm coming after them I claim them well I'm heir of all things they're given unto me I am an an heir and I can claim all the things that God has promised me how then can I get it is it possibly by something that you can do of course not because it's an unmerited gift that God has given us and it's ours and they belong to us Satan cannot hold it back if you go against the authority that's in the scriptures and with faith to say it's mine Let It Go the prophet says I like that he said Satan Let Her Go you took her away from me give her back now because now I'm giving you a warning I have the warning that's written here in the word the prophet says that lot got himself in a problem and maybe he was in Chains and when the news came to Abraham the prophet says that even lot was a possession that belonged to Abraham lot belonged to Abraham lot found himself in a problem the prophet says that he might had H shackles around his neck just like as the picture shows slaves walking through the desert his own daughters were in Chains maybe his own wife was in Chains but Abraham had possession of lot not only of the physical land but also of his Kinsmen his relatives Abraham and Abraham was not a soldier he wasn't trained to carry a weapon he says look the only thing he had was a little bunch of servants probably a dozen and there was probably couple of thousand men armed and his man man wasn't soldiers they were servants Cattlemen sheepmen herders probably old rusty knives that they had picked up somewhere I just want you to imagine the scene L was taken captive by the king's a big army abah so Abraham he only had a dozen of these uh Shepherds and these Shepherds they were not soldiers they were not trained for battle and they had no Shields they had no swords that were glistening he said they had old rusty knives Maybe they were just there lying on the grass they were just laying out there it says maybe the rains were falling on them but it says Abraham wasn't looking at the rusty knife or the no Shield at all he was laying his faith upon God's word he didn't see if his servants were trained or not God told him I have given you all things so then he took his cattl with their Rusty knives and he went to go get what he owned he released lot he released his daughter his wife how did he do it I don't know but he took it old rusty knife and he killed all those kings slaughtered all the soldiers because when God promises you something you have to go take it the Devil is a bluff how are you going to fight against that that's not up to me what's up to me and what's up to you is for you to place your faith in God in what God said it's mine I'm going after what belongs to me amen he says now when people that sick can see that the sickness is right about over with right then I'm closing now but I'm going to turn the corner how many have your seat belts on the devil's a bluff he has no power we just merely have to believe what God has already said we have to motivate the faith that's inside us well what would be your reaction if I tell you that the proph Propet tells me in the message Moses preached in in uh 1950 the prophet says he says you can't Bluff Satan it's it's a sad thing I don't have the quotes on the screen but the Devil is a bluff but now the prophet tells me that I cannot Bluff Satan the prophet says he says Satan he won't be bluffed oh man he says you've got to know where you're standing oh my goodness my God Amen man I want I want to preach in English now amen the Church of the Living God cannot Bluff Satan we can't Bluff Satan even though he's a bluff but we can't Bluff him because he knows who he is he knows who you are he knows the message he knows the Bible sometimes sometimes the children of God they don't know their message but the devil does know his message he knows his message and it's very sad sometimes you talk with people and they don't know the message of the hour I'll say it again sometimes I talk with people and they don't know the message but Satan does know the message that's why the prophet tells me the devil's a bluff death is a bluff but I I can't Bluff the devil he knows who I am he knows the life that I have he knows if I'm a hypocrite he knows if I'm here or there I can pray and say Satan get away from my family but the devil knows if I'm a hypocrite he knows if I'm a Child of God or if I'm a hypocrite and the prophet says I can't Bluff Satan he says the devil will not let himself be bluffed he won't let himself he's going to fight for what's his he will fight for you not to get your healing he will fight for your daughter not to come back he will fight for your home not to be restored he won't let himself be bluffed though he is a bluff but he won't let him himself we must fight for every inch for every inch that is ours the prophet tells me I don't know what the prophet is telling you William Bram but the prophet William Bram tells me he says I must know where I'm standing I must know where I'm standing so brother sister where are you saying on Jero tacle or on God's word because when you you come close to the devil and you say devil this is my I'm an associate pastor of Jericho the devil will not take that but when I say to him I am a child of God I stand on his word don't have any power but the power of the Lord Jesus Christ he gives it to me the devil he knows his message he knows the Bible you have to know where you're standing the prophet says in the message demonology he says and therefore it must take the very deepest of sincerity we must be sincere not only with the brothers at church you have to be sincere with yourself know know who I am am I truly a Christian am I truly a child of God we must be sincere when the disciples they saw how Paul would pray they saw how the Lord Jesus Christ would pray and the the disciples wanted to mimic as Paul and Jesus prayed and Satan said the devil said he says I know Jesus I know Paul but who are you the devil will not let himself be bluffed though he has no power but he has all rights to take what we neglect when we pray we must be sincere not I'm just copying the copying the prophet prayer you can quote the prophet pray but if you're not sincere the devil's goingon to say I know who willing BR is who are but who are you he's not a he can't be bluffed that's what the prophet saying in the message demonology in the 1953 he says it isn't a bluff you can't Bluff the devil at all he won't Bluff he won't do it but whenever you really can produce the blood of Jesus Christ Satan can't stand before that of what my religion or my title my church when I apply the blood of Jesus Christ Satan can't stand before that it's either one or the other the blood or other things amen I'm closing there was once a sister that attended another church I'm I'm quoting from The Prophet's message and this sister had a very serious issue she had something that she could not be delivered from would do you want to know what her problem was raise your hands if you want to know if you want me to tell you okay there's not many hands right up okay one more time okay okay you want to see what this sister had she had a problem but she couldn't see what was inside her I'm warning you you already raised your hand I want to say it I'm I'm going to say it and the pastor William Bram her Pastor said go to William brandham William Bram go with William brandham and he will tell you what you have are you ready she committed adultery and that devil grabbed her and she was afraid of going with who the dentist the dentist would give her a medicine and that medicine would make her hallucinator speak she didn't want to speak or confess you raise your hands now this is the message it's message of the hour the devil won't be bluffed you must be sincere and tonight we want to be sincere so she comes to the prophet and the prophet is going to tell her what she has I'm just going to read a little portion but you at home you can go read the rest in the message do you now believe in 1953 and the prophet said I told her of course that's all you can do sister you just I just did what God Said to do there is your problem the prophet in other words said I can't pray for you until you fix your problem even the prophet of the hour Vindicated by God Malachi 4 stop the storm could not cast out a devil even the Devil is a bluff but the devil knows his rights the devil said not even the prophet can kick me out until you confess what you did he won't let himself be bluffed I said sister can anoint you with oil every five minutes through the day for the rest of your life it'll never do you any good I said and they might lay their hands on you and the ministers Stomp and kick the devils and say get out of here Satan he says but you don't have to holl at him he in other words the devil the devil knows what faith is he knows what your life is the devil knows the life that you carry oh man God God help us so there is no need of you trying to Bluff him he will stay right there and got a right to stay there he knows the devil knows what his rights is what he can do and what he can't the devil knows what he can do what he can't do Prophet says he said it's a positive he said say well I believe God I base my faith there is the devil cannot be bluffed God is not a bluff and Satan is neither a bluff he won't take your bluff but when you really God faith Satan will know it that's right he knows where faith is at he knows who's right we're speaking about the devil we're not speaking about God he knows who has it he knows who's right and who's wrong he knows where Faith stands the devil knows who's right and who's wrong God is not a bluff and the devil won't let himself be bless he knows his rights but we also know our rights why don't you stand and our rights is when you be sincere with God and you say God God I've made so many mistakes I've done so many things but Lord I claim my home I claim son and daughter my grandchildren I claim them because they're mine they're not the Devils Satan maybe I've done many mistakes but I'm a human being but I'm a Child of God a child of God cannot lose their salvation I know that I've made my parisher and mistakes Satan I hope you're listening I am a child of God that has fallen but God's word has come to my time to restore and I claim my family I claim my son my daughter my home they don't belong to you I don't come before you Lord with my own merits because I play at church I have a nice dress on I stand before you Lord covered by the blood of Jesus Christ that's the only Power that can defeat the Devil and tonight I'm speaking to the Church of God I'm not speaking to the Church of Jero I'm I'm speaking to the called out I'm speaking to the Bride of Jesus Christ telling you the devil is a block and wants to steal your joy and steal your son tonight claim what belongs to you claim it confess what you've done say Lord I confess that I made this mistake this mistake but father help me to accept your word you can close your eyes God

this Serenity Lord we know that you're here Lord father your word it's bitter and it's sweet now father help us to eat that word the Devil is a bluff but the devil also knows his rights he won't let

daughters they don't want to come to the things of God maybe their sons don't want to come to the word of God maybe their own marriage is falling apart or maybe their own home is falling aparts father
