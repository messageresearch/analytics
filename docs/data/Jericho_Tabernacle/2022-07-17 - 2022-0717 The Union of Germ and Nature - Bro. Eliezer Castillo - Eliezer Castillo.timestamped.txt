[22:12] um quickly before we sing this song anta
[22:15] cantare
[22:18] a few days after deciding we wanted to
[22:20] sing the song
[22:24] a tape my brother bernie was shared with
[22:26] me
[22:31] in 1978 he preached a message titled
[22:35] premier
[22:36] and milo sientos
[22:38] predicamente
[22:43] the song has been on my mind for a long
[22:45] time and i believe it was a confirmation
[22:47] for us to sing it
[22:55] he references the scripture philippians
[22:58] 3 10 through 14 and i'll read it in
[22:59] spanish to save time
[23:53] jesus
[23:58] [Music]
[24:08] well the bible tells a story
[24:12] i'm sure you all heard of sodom and
[24:16] gomorrah and how god gave lot his word
[24:20] that he would spare his family from that
[24:24] awful day of wrath
[24:26] if they would flee that wicked city
[24:32] don't look back
[24:34] [Music]
[24:38] now the lord had sent to angels to take
[24:42] lot's
[24:44] family away from that destruction that
[24:48] the town was gonna see
[24:51] they said don't look behind you as you
[24:54] leave this dreaded place but that
[24:58] request turned out to be more than lot's
[25:01] wife could take she couldn't bear to
[25:05] turn her back on all those things she
[25:08] had so she traded off a lifetime for a
[25:13] memory that didn't last
[25:16] [Applause]
[25:18] [Music]

[1:03:26] for that
[1:03:28] so i just want to go straight into the
[1:03:30] message
[1:03:33] um
[1:03:34] just to give you an overview of what we
[1:03:36] just read
[1:03:40] it's saying put off that old man
[1:03:51] and every single person has that old man
[1:03:56] or i should say every single person was
[1:03:58] born with that old man
[1:04:03] before i keep saying old man
[1:04:07] brother branham said not to call your
[1:04:09] parents old man and old lady
[1:04:16] but today we're going to call this
[1:04:17] person the old man
[1:04:22] he's the corrupt deceitful person is
[1:04:26] and that's the person we were born with
[1:04:28] yes
[1:04:31] brother branham um said in the message
[1:04:34] the individ uh invisible union of the
[1:04:36] bride of christ
[1:04:41] now this is the message where i'm going
[1:04:43] to base my my sermon with today
[1:04:50] and my title today
[1:04:53] is the union of germ and nature
[1:04:59] the union of germ and nature
[1:05:02] naturalessa now brother branham says
[1:05:06] now in romans 7
[1:05:08] aura and romano
[1:05:10] trusting that you have your bibles open
[1:05:14] if you would like to turn with me to
[1:05:15] romans 7 also
[1:05:19] he said everywhere now across the
[1:05:22] country
[1:05:25] we want to read closely
[1:05:29] now this it this message of here it
[1:05:33] seems like it's on marriage and divorce
[1:05:35] but it really isn't all right
[1:05:45] it's a prophecy of the church in the
[1:05:47] last days
[1:05:55] so he says it looks like it's a message
[1:05:58] or scripture about marriage and divorce
[1:06:02] is
[1:06:04] but he said no it is a prophecy of the
[1:06:06] bride in the last days
[1:06:11] if you would like to
[1:06:13] read from two or
[1:06:15] chapters seven two and 3.
[1:06:21] it says for the woman which has a
[1:06:24] husband is bound by the law to her
[1:06:27] to her husband so as long as he lives
[1:06:30] but if the husband be dead she is loosed
[1:06:33] from the law of her husband
[1:06:45] so then while her husband lives she she
[1:06:48] be married to another man she
[1:06:51] shall be called an adulteress but if her
[1:06:54] husband be dead she is free from that
[1:06:56] law
[1:06:57] so that she is no adulteress through
[1:07:00] though she be married to another man
[1:07:15] what an amazing scripture amen
[1:07:19] now remember this is a
[1:07:21] scripture of prophecy
[1:07:27] this is a scripture of the bride today
[1:07:33] if we go all the way down to 14.
[1:07:37] this is where you see that little fight
[1:07:54] the good that i tried to do it
[1:07:57] i don't do it
[1:07:59] and and the evil that i don't want to do
[1:08:03] he said i do it
[1:08:06] he said now there there's two laws
[1:08:08] within me they say
[1:08:20] and he said all wretched man that i am
[1:08:30] wretched man that i am
[1:08:32] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:08:35] this death
[1:08:44] because first he says all wretched man
[1:08:47] that i am
[1:08:50] then he said who's going to deliver me
[1:08:52] from me
[1:08:58] but i need deliverance from myself
[1:09:03] two natures fighting against one another
[1:09:08] but on 25 he says but i thank god
[1:09:11] through jesus christ our lord
[1:09:18] giving us
[1:09:32] through jesus christ our lord jesus
[1:09:34] christ
[1:09:36] so then with my mind myself serve the
[1:09:39] law of god but within my flesh the law
[1:09:42] of sin
[1:09:44] lamented
[1:09:57] so most of the times when we read this
[1:10:00] scripture enthusiasm
[1:10:03] we see it as a fight
[1:10:06] we see it as a battle
[1:10:09] but
[1:10:10] just like um brother branham said
[1:10:13] this is
[1:10:29] so paul is typing this to a relationship
[1:10:36] he said i i need to get out of this
[1:10:39] relationship
[1:10:59] [Music]
[1:11:36] today i want to say a little story today
[1:11:42] a story of uh the story of abigail
[1:11:47] who knows the story of abigail
[1:11:50] the story of abigail and
[1:11:52] david
[1:11:55] david
[1:11:56] before i i want to start reading the
[1:11:58] scriptures
[1:12:02] i just want to set the scene
[1:12:06] so
[1:12:14] david is in a
[1:12:16] between a rock place a a rock and a hard
[1:12:19] place david uh
[1:12:34] and he showed that he had the favor of
[1:12:36] the lord
[1:12:40] the evil spirit was upon saul to to
[1:12:43] chase him and
[1:12:44] take him down
[1:12:48] a
[1:12:48] second
[1:12:50] but
[1:12:51] but david began to be on the run and he
[1:12:53] would go from place to place from cave
[1:12:55] to caves
[1:13:00] and wherever he went he would bless
[1:13:10] the bible says that he was prophesied
[1:13:12] over to be the king of israel
[1:13:15] foreign
[1:13:34] and we could see that's a very
[1:13:36] amazing type of our lord jesus christ
[1:13:42] jesus christ is
[1:13:58] so our lord jesus christ goes from place
[1:14:01] to place from heart to heart
[1:14:08] blessing each and every one of us
[1:14:11] blessing the people that he makes
[1:14:13] contact with medicine
[1:14:18] that's where david found himself
[1:14:22] if you would like to turn with me to
[1:14:24] first samuel 25 secretary clinton
[1:14:37] the bible says that samuel finally died
[1:14:43] now i'm just going to give you a little
[1:14:44] um
[1:14:45] i'm going to skip through a bunch of
[1:14:46] things
[1:14:49] but he died
[1:14:52] and in
[1:14:54] in the bible says that david arose and
[1:14:58] went down to the wilderness
[1:15:04] in verse two it says
[1:15:06] and there was a man in um
[1:15:11] whose possessions were in carmel and the
[1:15:13] man was very great and he had three
[1:15:16] thousand sheep and a thousand goats and
[1:15:19] he was shearing his sheep in carmel
[1:15:22] you say
[1:15:33] now the name of the man was nabal and uh
[1:15:37] and the name of his wife abigail she was
[1:15:40] a woman of good understanding and of a
[1:15:43] beautiful countenance but
[1:15:46] the man was churlish and evil in his
[1:15:49] doings and he was of the house of caleb
[1:16:04] and
[1:16:10] [Music]
[1:16:20] [Music]
[1:16:24] amen amen so this natural story it takes
[1:16:28] place in a place called carmel
[1:16:30] esta historian
[1:16:45] there's three characters
[1:16:49] there was david estaba he was the
[1:16:51] fugitive king
[1:16:54] there was nabel
[1:16:55] nabal and there was abigail abigail
[1:16:59] nable if i just want to
[1:17:01] lay it out here
[1:17:05] what is our out our worldly nature
[1:17:10] there is a rebel in each and every one
[1:17:12] of us
[1:17:18] [Music]
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:52] he is the holy
[1:18:58] then you become a partaker and after the
[1:19:01] coming into his body a partaker of his
[1:19:03] divine nature
[1:19:04] this is
[1:19:46] [Music]
[1:20:01] but we don't know that abigail's in
[1:20:03] there
[1:20:07] of life
[1:20:11] that was there before the foundation of
[1:20:13] the world
[1:20:16] brother
[1:20:43] maybe they're still out in the world
[1:20:47] maybe they're still out there drinking
[1:20:49] and partying
[1:20:52] maybe they're out there committing
[1:20:54] adultery
[1:20:56] foreign
[1:21:26] is the reason we
[1:21:40] now the next step is
[1:21:43] redeem means to buy back
[1:21:48] it restores to the original owners
[1:21:53] god by his death the shed blood brought
[1:21:55] us back to his own broad it was back his
[1:21:58] own
[1:22:02] lodel
[1:22:04] he bought back the spoken word sea bride
[1:22:07] el compro de welte
[1:22:22] amen amen so how how did she
[1:22:26] marry nabel
[1:22:30] how can such a righteous person
[1:22:34] marry somebody so evil
[1:23:06] showing that they were going to
[1:23:08] work with one another and be allies
[1:23:14] and many times in those days the the
[1:23:17] parents would go and arrange
[1:23:31] she couldn't do herself
[1:23:35] something that she didn't decide for it
[1:23:40] and that's the way we are today
[1:23:44] brother branham says in the invisible
[1:23:46] union of the bride
[1:24:55] because it would stick to the world
[1:24:59] it loves everything of the world
[1:25:03] and you know what over time if you say
[1:25:07] i believe she begins to love nable yo
[1:25:10] yeah
[1:25:16] he continues to say now it was nature
[1:25:19] associated with death
[1:25:24] your
[1:25:52] world
[1:25:55] we can't condemn a sinner for being a
[1:25:57] sinner
[1:25:59] you can't condemn somebody that loves
[1:26:01] the world out there
[1:26:05] foreign
[1:26:34] when he preached the message it would
[1:26:36] cut he conducted
[1:26:39] when he preached the message you could
[1:26:41] feel it
[1:26:44] because he wasn't preaching out to the
[1:26:46] world
[1:27:32] he was preaching to those that said yes
[1:27:33] i'm a christian i'm filled with the holy
[1:27:35] ghost
[1:27:40] well if they we claim that buenos aires
[1:27:43] says i claim that see your
[1:27:57] because i'm not claiming that i'm not
[1:28:06] [Music]
[1:28:12] he had to change
[1:28:27] amen amen
[1:28:29] but to the
[1:28:31] a person that is born of the world
[1:28:36] you begin to love
[1:28:37] that nature
[1:28:43] he says your desires was by nature to
[1:28:46] love the world you're part of this
[1:28:53] you're a part of nature it is
[1:28:56] you believe that
[1:28:58] amen and that's your natural thing amen
[1:29:04] so there they begin to work with one
[1:29:06] another
[1:29:22] but the bible says that nabel means
[1:29:26] he was he was a rough person
[1:29:30] he was stubborn
[1:29:33] he he was foolish
[1:29:36] and and because of his wife
[1:29:40] the blessings were there uh
[1:29:45] and that's our life yes
[1:29:48] then there is a time in our life
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:05] a la puerta de naval god begins to knock
[1:30:08] at our door not making us or forcing us
[1:30:10] to be christians
[1:30:16] i believe he had three hundred men ready
[1:30:18] to go
[1:30:29] these men would take on thousands of
[1:30:31] people
[1:30:32] just one
[1:30:46] but he went and sent 10 men
[1:30:50] and in first samuel 25
[1:30:54] they began to say
[1:30:57] or he told his people to say this
[1:31:02] and thus say ye shall ye say to him that
[1:31:07] liveth in prosperity
[1:31:09] peace be both unto thee peace be to
[1:31:12] thine house and peace be unto
[1:31:15] all that thou hast
[1:31:24] amen
[1:31:25] jesus is the god of peace amen
[1:31:29] and now that i have heard that thou has
[1:31:32] has has shearers
[1:31:34] now thy shepherds were which were with
[1:31:37] us we hurt them not
[1:31:39] neither was out
[1:31:42] any missing unto them all the while
[1:31:44] we're there in caramel caramel
[1:31:57] there he god has given him grace
[1:32:01] god you know for the the reason enables
[1:32:04] success
[1:32:06] to the naval the reason of his fortune
[1:32:23] and we watched over them
[1:32:26] we didn't do anything wrong but we
[1:32:28] watched over the sheep and your people
[1:32:34] and he had to realize that he was
[1:32:36] blessed because of david
[1:32:52] that situation when they could have went
[1:32:54] really bad
[1:32:59] there was somebody watching
[1:33:02] there was somebody watching over the
[1:33:04] sheep
[1:33:06] there was
[1:33:20] god is showing grace showing that i was
[1:33:23] there when you almost died
[1:33:30] my healing hand was there when you were
[1:33:32] sick
[1:33:36] jesus christ is there every step of the
[1:33:38] way
[1:33:42] now what did mabel say
[1:33:46] verses 10 it says
[1:33:49] and abel answered
[1:33:50] and answered david's servants and said
[1:33:53] who is david
[1:33:55] and who is the son of jesse
[1:33:57] there be many servants nowadays that
[1:34:00] break away from every man his master
[1:34:16] then i take my bread and my water and my
[1:34:18] flesh that i have killed for my shears
[1:34:20] and give it to men whom i know not where
[1:34:23] they be
[1:34:27] prepared
[1:34:42] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:34:44] peace
[1:34:58] for it is not subject to the law of god
[1:35:00] neither indeed can be poor no
[1:35:05] navel said who is this guy
[1:35:09] he knew who david was
[1:35:11] there was reports across the whole land
[1:35:13] avian informes puerto de la tierra who
[1:35:16] this man who slayed the great giants
[1:35:21] this fugitive king that has been
[1:35:24] anointed
[1:35:26] he knew
[1:35:29] because he said shall i help all those
[1:35:32] that are left leave their master
[1:35:37] he knew exactly who he was
[1:36:10] i don't want nothing to do with those
[1:36:12] christian people
[1:36:14] i don't want nothing to do with that
[1:36:16] world or that religious world
[1:36:21] why our nature is against god
[1:36:30] he says how can he work with you when
[1:36:33] our nature and of the spirit is of the
[1:36:35] devil there it is
[1:36:58] he says and every man born of the earth
[1:37:01] is born in sin shaped in iniquity come
[1:37:04] to this world speaking
[1:37:26] how can we go farther with god with our
[1:37:29] carnal nature
[1:37:39] [Music]
[1:37:44] there's a germ of life in each and every
[1:38:12] that's the germ of life
[1:38:27] by nature we shun away from god we don't
[1:38:29] want nothing to do with him
[1:38:34] we're born with that nature
[1:38:36] by nature we are selfish
[1:38:41] by nature we we hate all those things
[1:38:46] now what happened whenever
[1:38:48] nabel said this
[1:38:53] the bible says that wrath
[1:38:56] is for the children of disobedience
[1:39:01] the bible says in in 1316
[1:39:06] and david said unto his men
[1:39:15] and they were girded and every man his
[1:39:17] sword and david also girded his sword
[1:39:19] and there went up after david about 400
[1:39:22] 400 men and 200 abode by the stuff
[1:39:35] but one of the young young men told
[1:39:37] abigail
[1:39:38] nable's wife saying behold seven david
[1:39:41] sent messengers out of the wilderness to
[1:39:43] salute our master and he railed on them
[1:39:52] beyond
[1:39:57] but the men were very good to us
[1:40:00] and we were not hurt neither missed we
[1:40:03] anything as long as we were
[1:40:06] conserving with them when we were there
[1:40:09] in the fields
[1:40:19] and they they were a wall to us both day
[1:40:22] and night while we were with them
[1:40:24] keeping the sheep
[1:40:33] therefore know and consider what you
[1:40:36] will do for this evil is determined
[1:40:38] against our master and against all of
[1:40:41] his household for he is such a son of
[1:40:44] belial
[1:40:46] a man that cannot speak to him that a
[1:40:48] man cannot speak to him
[1:41:03] now this word is a very strange word in
[1:41:06] in english
[1:41:09] he says for he is such a man of belial
[1:41:13] this in english
[1:41:16] a man that a man cannot speak to him he
[1:41:20] says
[1:41:22] he's a man
[1:41:24] or he called him he's a belial man
[1:41:29] now that word in in the old testament
[1:41:34] you
[1:41:35] frequently used as worthless
[1:41:40] but in second corinthians 6 14.
[1:41:44] el capitan
[1:41:50] yoked together with unbelievers
[1:41:52] for what fellowship hath
[1:41:55] um with
[1:41:56] righteousness with unrighteousness
[1:41:58] this
[1:42:14] and what concord has christ with bilal
[1:42:18] or what part
[1:42:20] has he
[1:42:21] that believeth with an infidel
[1:42:40] is
[1:42:42] what
[1:42:43] does christ have to do with the devil
[1:42:48] how could we we be how could they be
[1:42:51] yoked together equally
[1:43:04] and he said how could christ and the
[1:43:06] devil be yoked together or have
[1:43:08] fellowship
[1:43:16] [Music]
[1:43:23] he said this man is a devil el dijo
[1:43:26] hombre es diablo this man is a wicked
[1:43:28] man
[1:43:30] to where nobody can go and talk to him
[1:43:34] where grace comes
[1:43:55] that if we allow that date nature to
[1:43:58] rule we will
[1:44:00] will destroy our lives
[1:44:17] in colossians 3 5 and ten it says encore
[1:44:22] fortify therefore your members which are
[1:44:24] upon the earth fornication uncleanness
[1:44:27] in inordinate affection evil conspicuous
[1:44:30] and covetousness which
[1:44:47] sake the wrath of god cometh up on the
[1:44:50] children of disobedience
[1:44:56] because the disobedience because
[1:44:59] the members of our body
[1:45:14] we will become children of disobedience
[1:45:16] and the wrath of god will be upon us
[1:45:23] no wonder brother branham says ye must
[1:45:25] be born or jesus said you must be born
[1:45:28] again
[1:45:52] wrath of god is for all those things
[1:45:54] fornication and uncleanness
[1:46:10] the bible said the servants begin to uh
[1:46:14] alert abigail
[1:46:19] now there was a difference between
[1:46:21] abigail knowing that david was there and
[1:46:24] nable our aviona
[1:46:37] but when abigail recognized
[1:46:54] maybe many years the word can be
[1:46:57] preached to a person
[1:47:01] i don't want anything to do with it
[1:47:04] no thank you i don't want anything
[1:47:48] evil
[1:47:52] he was going to cause every single
[1:47:54] person in the household to die
[1:47:59] the bible says she got up and started to
[1:48:01] do something this is
[1:48:43] abigail begins to hear the word of the
[1:48:45] lord
[1:48:51] inside each and every person here
[1:48:55] begin to see that the lord of god
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:40] begin to come down the road
[1:49:45] there she went to him
[1:49:51] and she fell on the ground
[1:49:54] now if you want to see perfect
[1:49:56] repentance
[1:49:59] read the story of abigail
[1:50:02] she went down on the ground
[1:50:05] i began to repent
[1:50:08] even though it was in her faults
[1:50:13] you're not the one that sinned
[1:50:16] that germ of life is not the one that
[1:50:18] sins
[1:50:20] it's your nature that causes you to sin
[1:50:22] every single day
[1:50:26] it's that old man that you don't want to
[1:50:28] do those things but yet you still do it
[1:50:30] all right
[1:50:34] because of that old man
[1:50:36] hombre
[1:51:03] oh it was him it was all him
[1:51:07] no she said it's all on me lord
[1:51:11] sorry i didn't mean to do it father
[1:51:16] when you get down to a great a real
[1:51:19] repentance
[1:51:22] oh something has to happen
[1:51:26] change the lord's course
[1:51:30] because god spoke it in the beginning
[1:51:33] there's a course of judgment coming down
[1:51:36] already
[1:51:39] it's it's a train of of
[1:51:41] 600 or 400 soldiers
[1:51:47] coming to poor wrath on every single
[1:51:49] person every single children of
[1:51:51] disobedience
[1:51:57] but she repented and she gave her
[1:51:59] repentance to him
[1:52:12] she said you are going to become king of
[1:52:33] amen amen and god forgave and david
[1:52:36] forgave them
[1:52:39] he repented in his heart
[1:52:55] knowing that they were preserved their
[1:52:58] life was preserved
[1:53:02] but we all know that in justification
[1:53:04] that old man is still there
[1:53:07] justification
[1:53:09] he was still there honestly and when she
[1:53:12] went there he was partying and drinking
[1:53:17] fiesta
[1:53:18] the bible says he was
[1:53:20] in in a party just like he was a king
[1:53:23] this is
[1:53:27] and she goes and she tells them
[1:53:29] everything that he did
[1:53:30] that she did
[1:53:34] whenever you're justified
[1:53:37] nature finds it sees the repentance of
[1:53:40] god
[1:53:44] the bible says that he heard those words
[1:53:49] his heart turned into stones
[1:53:53] his heart turned into stone and he died
[1:53:56] ten late days later
[1:54:01] god took over
[1:54:05] took over the judgment of david
[1:54:21] and he killed that man that old man that
[1:54:24] all nature
[1:54:28] she was sanctified
[1:54:31] she was free from that old nature that
[1:54:33] old man
[1:55:16] an
[1:55:29] david says i'm gonna make her my wife
[1:55:34] i'm going to make her my wife
[1:55:37] he was the new man
[1:55:43] but you have to mortify your members
[1:55:48] if you would like to stand with me
[1:55:51] you have to mortify your members
[1:55:55] we cannot be in in church and in the
[1:55:58] world at the same time
[1:56:02] because then we cause
[1:56:04] adultery entonces

[1:56:10] playing with jesus's heart
