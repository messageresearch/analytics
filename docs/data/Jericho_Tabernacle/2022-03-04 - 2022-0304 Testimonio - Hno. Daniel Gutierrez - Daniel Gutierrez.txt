here as well [Music] and as well to them that are watching us online [Music] hello we would like to welcome you in the name of the lord jesus christ i would like if you can please to be able to honor the word let's go to the book of saint john capitolo cuatro chapter four version starting with verse 39. [Music] [Music] and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that i ever did so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them any abode their two days [Music] and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the savior of the world you may be seated please almost we would like to thank the musicians i believe that music is something that's very beautiful we read in the bible that it says that many believed on the saying of the samaritan woman but then afterwards it was not only based on herself because as they themselves hurt him they were able to see that this was in fact the son of god and i personally identify that's why i really like this scripture because the first time that i ever read a message of the prophet no one ever talked to me about the message i only read a portion of the book and that drew my attention and right away i understood that this was the man of god and from then on i read so much more messages maybe around 50. in the year 1978. we went from the city of juarez to california and while i was there when i began to work somebody began to talk to me about the word of god when do you stand for that juarez when i was in the city of juarez i had no knowledge whatsoever of the word by god's grace i married a christian woman she was born and raised within christianity juanito maybe somebody can remember like brother juanito around 1977 there was a bit of a confusion where the message was really divided many that believed like we did they uh they divided themselves and the one that leaded them the leader you could say of that william soto was william and then from that time on this idiot and even the uncle of my wife he went with that uh that sort of idea and that's when my wife even though she at the moment was not my wife that's when she got confused and for some time that brought her out of christianity i do believe that it was god that allowed that the year 1972 nos casamos mis posayo my wife and i got married we were very young we started a very difficult tough life because basically we were still very young we were kids when there is not a good leadership there's not a good father of the head of the house direction you go out without having that fatherly figure it i was able to see god's love in some people and one of them was the grandmother of my wife she always lived to me what she believed she had all the right to not treat me because i had married her most dearest granddaughter yo no tenia buena fama and i wasn't a guy with a good reputation maybe victor chavez i don't know if he's here he might have known what kind of a man i was back then his mother really did she really didn't know me sister and phoenix so when they saw that in the year of 1983 i was baptized at phoenix tabernacle they said god really transforms people that's what i was trying to say when her grandmother had all the right to not treat me good pero nunca but it was never light up she always respectfully treated me good with a lot of love the same way my mother's wife acted towards me amelia favilla amelia fabila and these women truly lived god's love to me entonces has so that's how we began our marriage life california in 1978 we arrived in california and there was a certain brother from a certain church he began to invite me to go to church but i really was not interested because ever since i was in the city of juarez i was really into music we i had my own band and we would play at the nightclubs so i had no interest in the gospel that's why i can understand where it says that uh no one looked for god realm it's god that comes looking for you foreign i had no interest of getting out of what i was in back then entonces so that's how the years went by phoenix arizona in the year of 1980 we arrived here at phoenix arizona and in 1980 i was still into music here playing and singing at the nightclubs it got to the point that my wife and i were 13 years married and she thought that i was a helpless case we seriously had a conversation and we decided to break up by then my third daughter was just born she was only a year old when we decided to break up but there was something within me i really loved that little girl special because that little girl ever since she was in her mother's womb she was very special that little girl and so that's how time went on and then she was born and when i would arrive early in the morning i would find that the little girl was crying and i would ask i would ask my wife what's wrong with her yes and she said i don't know what's wrong with her and i said well hand her over to me i would hold her in my arms and as soon as i would hold her she would stop crying she would go to sleep and that's how time went on and then the little girl began to walk and she knew at what time i would arrive she would stand waiting on the door and nobody could move her while she was there waiting for me yeah she would grab my hand i'll see you i believe god made her in that special way to soften my heart because my heart that one when it got to the point that we were going to break up that little girl was the the point that hurt me the most i believe that i did love all of my daughters but that little girl was very special there was no way for me to doubt that this was god when i was a child i lived in a little village of the state of coagula when i was around the age of four five or six and god uh reminded me of that stage when i was a child and god would make me look at that scene when that little boy was going to the bed crying because i was hungry and as i was walking pensando i was thinking i could hear my own thinking of that little boy i would say when i get older you know i won't allow my children to go through this and god was reminding me of that he said do you remember that and now you're going to leave your family because you want to live the way you want to yes just again and what about your daughters what's going to happen to them and those two voices are constantly going back and forth day and night and i couldn't sleep day or night because those voices wouldn't let me go to sleep until i felt that i was going crazy because i couldn't even go to sleep so what i did is i began to cry out to god and i said lord if it truly is you see this if it is you and you do change people's lives if you change mind then i'll serve you because i can't change lord yo no i don't know you yo no real men existed if and then i started making up excuses to not go to sing at the night and that neighbor suddenly he began to change instead of having grass on it he had bottles of beers scattered all over the place but one day he went to my house he said no because today is the last day yeah tomorrow and then in the future i'll serve the lord i said well if that's good for you and your family then that's really good i didn't believe him but from then on i began to see that first he began to clean up his yard and then on the following sunday i saw that he got up he was nicely dressed and he just waved immediately and he says uh daniel we're going to church and i said uh we'll go another day and about two or three weeks went by immediately and he invited me again he uh came um illegal fourth time to ask me and he asked me this yeah boy are you going to go with me this time yeah and he said well on sunday we'll leave at 9 30. i said that's fine that's fine domingo estaba on sunday i was ready and then he talked to the pastor and they started making me song lead me and i liked it i began to feel that there was a transformation taking place in my life because god always places a person to help you god makes someone to speak to you so i was at that church for about a year everything was going smoothly but then suddenly they wanted to teach me to speak in tongues and i don't speak in by then i had already read the messages of brother branham juarez because every time i would go to juarez from here to juarez my gran my my wife's grandmother would always give me the messages of brother branham and we would get here and my wife would put them away for me but the day came that she was reading one of those books she was preparing my preparing my lunch she saw then that i got up she put that book on the table she uh prepared my lunch and put in the lunchbox i sat down and i began to read that book and then i couldn't get out of it from the point that i started reading the book of that message i felt that it was god speaking through that man so the time came that i finished reading all the books that we had me pastor and the brothers in the government i was explaining to them and i tried to explain to them why they emphasized so much on speaking on and i quoted the scripture that says speaking in tongues is the smallest gift that god can give to a man and to rather look for more for the gift of so i spoke to him and he said no no this is what i understand and this is what i teach because he said if you feel that you don't feel good here then you're free to go somewhere else i said you're right thank you i said i hope you can forgive me i'm not trying to be smart i'm simply just reading the scripture and that's what i saw and that's why i remarked it but actually it's something that i carried in my heart to be able to tell you yes and then we kept going to the same church around two years by then they wouldn't say hi to us anymore when we would exit to greed they would turn their back on us they didn't want to speak to us so one day we were on basis going to the evening service when we passed by phoenix and i told my wife uh let's go there i didn't know that brother bernie was there we heard that they started speaking about the prophet and that's where i felt comfortable and that's where i stayed that was at the end of 1983 and now we know why we're not there anymore so as time went on we have been able to see that god because it's something that i can say by personal elections so just like other uh this woman that we read here in the scripture the samaritan woman and the desire to try to share with the people that didn't believe in this message so then we started going to the missionary field and we were able to witness and experience a lot of miracles many times i was able to see uh alermanov brother bernie i was fixing up the microphones at the church when i heard voices outside the church so i went to go see what was going on and there was a brother that was having seizures when that brother was there lying on the floor yeah his mouth was and bleeding was a lot of people surrounding him that's when brother bernie was coming closer he came with his white shirt and with this tie in service ready to have the service he only needed his uh his coat when he saw us there he asked what's what's the matter yeah is i was explaining that the brother was having a seizure he else implemented me and he simply said uh just leave him to me and he bowed and he hugged him with his white shirt say you know that's angry it was uh stained with blood but it didn't matter to him he simply embraced him cuentas in the name of the lord jesus christ leave him immediately immediately that spirit came out of him because that man then got up he got up he was confused he wasn't aware of what was happening but now he was free delivered that's why i believe that there's several of us here okay [Music] and that way through his guidance we began to head out to the missionaries we were able to witness many miracles when manifestation del espirito santo venia when the manifestation of the holy ghost would come even demons would be cast out i would pray for people whose faces would be transformed so transform their voices would change and then on a certain occasion one time at my house they brought this person to me it was a sister and when i began to pray for her her her face changed so both her voice changed manos and from my hands they began to slide off as if her own face was slippery and she began to slither towards the door as as if she were herself the husband ran and he got her yeah and we prayed for her then and thankfully she was freed and there's so many experiences just like that one especially experiences of drug addiction i've prayed for people that are that have been in drugs that they have really heavy demons on them victorious and god has always come out on top victorious [Music] because all that's ever needed is for a person to be sincere and want to be free that's all that's needed god's power is here to set free and to heal anything solamente that's right it's really important that when someone is being prayed for man that you keep your eyes closed it is something that's dangerous and they're looking for another neglectful body that is not being reverent and then that person can acquire that demon that why that way we can see that gadarian it's a well-known scripture and there we can see how a person can be transformed little by little personas and there are people that simply don't understand joining together with a bad company or bad friends you can be infected or acquire their own demons demons that not even the animals put up with pores that's why the demon possessed gadarin controlled he had no self-control it was the power of that demon that was inside of him that man felt no pain he wouldn't feel anything so then the devil would give him the power to break those chains but something tremendous that draws my attention that when this gallery in man he would uh jump on everyone that would pass through there and when he saw that jesus christ was approaching the shore saliva he was going to jump on him the bible says that he ran towards him and then it says that when he saw him face to face there was such an expression of love in his face santa pass so much peace that no human is able to express that love and peace so he acknowledged that this was not a common human being he acknowledged who he was he said what ha what do you have to do with us son of the most high that you come to torment he wants the believers to keep themselves isolated because he knows when that the believers gather together there is power then porque se une estata is left powerless it doesn't matter what comes god always comes out victorious that's why we have this pandemic it's just a plan the plan is close down the churches keep the believer isolated and dis unified con miedo and fearful cuando la villa nos de clarino no no espirito de covardia when the bible itself told us that god has not given us a spirit of fear dion spirit god has given us the authority over every country god has given us the power here to cast out demons he's given us the power to pray for the sick it is convinced of that to be able to put god's power into action we know that god has given us a very beautiful church he's given us a very beautiful group of brothers and sisters and the power is now here amen that's why it's a viral importance a beautiful church we're happy because of it in less than a year we already have the church and says that's not just by chance so you can rest if you have this the prophet said that there will be a time and the bride will be just one e when that takes place he said then great things will be manifested this past sunday maybe you weren't aware but i was in the there in the town of san luis rio colorado i uh just on that sunday there was only four people there we held the morning service there and in the afternoon we went with another group of brothers who are also believers of this message those are brothers that i visited over a time period of 15 years and it had been around 15 years that i have not gone over it so then i felt the desire to go there there was only four people and then in the afternoon when we went with the other group they told us that they were waiting for us there in the morning their group is over a little over 30. around 30 or 40 people communication maybe because of a lack of communication uh no no organization we weren't able to organize everything right i believe they would have been even more beautiful that we were taking those we even were able to manage something because brother leyva already knows how to get it the lord is about to come for a people people that look for him uh people that is waiting for him and he's coming for that people yo okay i believe that there are some people here esperando that are waiting for man that love him and they have made themselves ready for when he comes and says next time i go the ones that go from here if you like you can go to that place as well they're already waiting for us in phoenix the pastor that's here now in phoenix because of his health he already knows about it it's just up to us to search for that fellowship we're going to read a quote from brother branagh's message hebrews chapter 6 part 2. do you see and it reads paragraph 84 he says it's now a finished work cristo murio because we don't see ourselves as finnish works but that's the beautiful part of nosotros he now seizes us he doesn't see us as the way we say and put god's word into practice and god will vindicate that word in the book of the seven church ages [Music] it might have to be that you have to seal your testimony with your very blood melees thousands and even millions have died throughout the ages they died they did not treasure or cherish their own life as something precious even in death we often think that it would be nearly impossible to be a martyr but just remember that faith jesus that we use on a daily basis to triumph in christ jesus polycarpus is the same faith that held up polycarp yatodo los martires and all the martyrs la fesu prema gracia that's why there's a tremendous watch for the bride before she's raptured as someone asked the prophet they asked him will the bride have an end time ministry and he says sure she will es that's what's starting now and says is to consecrate our life even more to god pablo and do what paul said you have i die daily how do and we allow for the holy ghost to take full control in our lives god will give us that power to be able to be raptured from this earth and before that we'll see the manifestation of the of the third pole in a very uh broad way where the spoken word will be manifested the prophet only did a little bit of that cuando el mismo when the lord himself told him just speak speak the word what is but then when he spoke the word yestava there they were so even for the bride en este tiempo in this time nova tener nada uh she won't have anything has just like the prophet had nothing but when he spoke the word it was manifest the lord jesus christ multiplied what was already there existencia it's not that he's not able to bring something into experience but he already he was simply multiplying what was already there multiplico los panes he multiplied the bread multiplicolo species he multiplied the fish then came into existence be sure that we're ready when the lord comes back and the lord will give us what we have needed we'll be closing with the scripture if you would like to and the abominable io and murderers los fornicarios and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and other liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death amendment brothers word what would have become of us what would have become of me if you did not transform if you would have not called vienna i thank you for all that you've done
