[23:48] my treasures are laid off
[23:51] somewhere beyond the blue
[23:55] the angels begging me
[23:58] from helen's open door
[24:01] and i can't feel at home in this world
[24:05] anymore
[24:09] oh lord you know
[24:12] i have no friend like you
[24:16] his health
[24:19] [Music]
[24:43] the saints on every
[24:48] [Music]
[25:04] oh
[25:10] [Music]
[25:15] what will i do
[25:18] [Music]
[25:34] [Music]
[25:38] we're going to be entering the
[25:41] most important part of the
[25:43] service
[25:47] let's
[25:48] let's sing this song as we introduce
[25:50] these two young brothers
[25:54] and nostrils
[26:07] bless the lord
[26:09] all my soul
[26:15] bless the lord
[26:18] [Music]
[26:24] god is
[26:25] within me
[26:28] [Music]
[26:43] bless the lord
[26:47] oh my soul
[26:52] [Music]
[26:57] is
[26:59] [Music]
[27:12] he
[27:12] has done
[27:14] great things
[27:16] [Music]
[27:26] he
[27:27] has done
[27:33] is
[27:37] [Music]
[27:41] [Laughter]
[27:45] [Music]
[27:48] the lord
[27:51] [Music]
[28:15] bless the lord
[28:19] for my soul
[28:22] and
[28:23] all god is
[28:28] [Music]
[28:39] [Music]
[28:59] just as you are standing if we can open
[29:00] our bibles to first john 5 4.
[29:06] and when you have it you can say it man
[29:30] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[29:32] the world and this is the victory that
[29:34] overcometh the world even our faith
[29:47] we thank you once again for the this
[29:49] service that you've allowed us to have
[30:16] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[30:18] amen amen
[30:20] he may be
[30:29] this evening we want to speak on the
[30:30] subject how can i overcome my worst
[30:32] enemy
[30:34] realm
[30:51] if there's no faith in our hearts then
[30:52] we're unable of doing anything
[30:59] because if you ask it without faith you
[31:01] might not be able to get it
[31:04] [Music]
[31:17] stay here and and a part of paragraph
[31:18] 32.
[31:25] and i've often thought of floating
[31:27] driftwood
[31:43] now you take on a stream like the stream
[31:45] of life and plenty of driftwood hanging
[31:47] up in every trash pile
[31:51] yes
[31:59] and yet the boat comes along made out of
[32:01] wood too but if you notice the wood is
[32:03] made and shaped out by a master
[32:06] construct
[32:15] who has built the boat not only is it
[32:17] shaped out but it is guided by a master
[32:20] and is it is pushed by a power
[32:23] helmet
[32:39] and i think we can imagine that we are
[32:41] that driftwood
[32:46] and we're just simply floating in the
[32:48] stream which is called life
[32:53] we're drifting without knowing
[32:55] [Music]
[33:05] [Music]
[33:08] you'll be getting stuck in all kinds of
[33:10] trash of this world
[33:14] getting stuck in every kind of thing
[33:16] that you find along your way
[33:20] and since you're just floating drifting
[33:22] away you're just going to be tossed to
[33:23] the side
[33:25] and won't be able to find the way out
[33:31] but like the scripture says all that
[33:33] overcomes the world are them that are
[33:35] born of god
[33:50] but if you notice the it's also guided
[33:53] by a force
[33:56] that lets it go through all the
[33:58] different kinds of trash
[34:01] and that power is faithful
[34:06] and the master that is driving that boat
[34:09] is actually our lord
[34:12] controlling
[34:14] and when you let the lord to take
[34:15] control and turn you into a bow you say
[34:18] conceived
[34:28] and through the faith that you get
[34:29] through him you'll be able to go through
[34:31] all the different kinds of trash that
[34:32] there is in this world
[34:37] [Music]
[34:40] i would like to read another quote from
[34:42] brother branham in the message how can i
[34:44] overcome
[34:47] which is in paragraph 41
[34:51] this is just an example that brother
[34:53] venom gives
[34:54] yo crusade
[34:57] he says i was crossing an old log the
[34:59] other day
[35:00] una cuenca
[35:14] and i jumped on this login on the
[35:16] outside it looked good looked like a big
[35:18] old beach log
[35:26] but when i jumped on it oh a great chunk
[35:28] of it fell off
[35:32] it was really it was real rotten and
[35:34] dottie
[35:37] cristianos and i said that's the way
[35:39] christians are becoming
[35:44] they've been dead in sin and trespasses
[35:47] so long question
[35:49] until they become dotty
[35:52] they can hold no weight at all
[36:00] [Music]
[36:06] [Music]
[36:10] he's speaking about a piece of log that
[36:11] he found in the water yes
[36:15] and that
[36:16] piece of log was dotty or was very soft
[36:18] on the inside
[36:22] because maybe it was already a lot of
[36:24] time that i had it had been in the water
[36:30] and then the water got into that log and
[36:32] caused it to become soft
[36:40] and what i liked and what seemed to
[36:42] couple together with the message of
[36:44] faith is a victory
[36:47] it's because brother venom uses a very
[36:49] same example
[36:55] and what seemed very similar to me is
[36:57] that a log was in the water and it had
[36:59] been there for quite a while
[37:02] until it was dead in that water since
[37:05] without a way out
[37:18] and it was getting to such a point that
[37:20] the water was actually coming inside of
[37:21] it
[37:24] and now it becomes us as christians
[37:31] when we're wandering through this world
[37:32] to the to the the different waters
[37:37] through the waters of sin and so forth
[37:42] that water if you do not have the faith
[37:45] to be able to overcome
[37:48] that water will begin to come inside you
[37:50] yes
[37:54] those waters of sin will begin to reach
[37:56] inside of you
[38:00] and when you least think about it you'll
[38:02] become very soft
[38:06] so soft that when a trial comes you
[38:07] won't be able to overcome it
[38:11] because on the inside you're now rotten
[38:15] because it has come to a point
[38:19] that it sucks and it doesn't know how to
[38:21] overcome
[38:23] control
[38:24] it doesn't know how to find a way out
[38:28] [Music]
[38:30] i would like to continue on this part
[38:37] but we know that there's something
[38:38] there's a master that can change us
[38:42] that he can use that would
[38:44] form
[38:57] this is in paragraph 34
[39:03] material and it says and we are all made
[39:06] out of the same material
[39:10] it just depends on how your ambitions
[39:12] run estadis
[39:19] are you willing to let the master craft
[39:20] and make out of you that which he could
[39:23] use
[39:27] and that which he could control and that
[39:29] which he could power
[39:33] every one of us is made
[39:36] we're crafted out of the same wood that
[39:38] the very lord can use
[39:51] then why then should i come to church
[40:00] i'd just rather stay at home watching
[40:01] the videos that they upload
[40:05] but if you're willing to wear your
[40:07] ambition runs
[40:32] it's up to your decision if you decide
[40:34] to remain in those waters of sin por que
[40:36] se
[40:40] because we know that through these
[40:41] waters the only way that we can come out
[40:46] is that he be the one that guides us
[40:52] and him giving us that faith that can
[40:54] actually power us
[40:58] because as the scripture says faith can
[41:00] overcome
[41:01] right now
[41:03] there is nothing that faith cannot do
[41:07] if you have a problem in your life
[41:10] but if you do not have the faith
[41:13] then how do you hope to overcome ef
[41:17] it's easy to come no doubt pray and ask
[41:22] but if you don't come with faith then
[41:23] what are you expecting
[41:30] if you don't have the faith that the
[41:31] lord can help and supply your need
[41:34] then we're we're without nothing solos
[41:37] implemented
[41:39] we're just rotten on the inside then
[41:40] yeah
[41:43] and it's just simply a teaching that has
[41:44] been laid upon us
[41:46] [Music]
[41:56] but when you are asking and you see what
[41:58] you're asking for is not being fulfilled
[42:05] [Music]
[42:14] and you have not accepted him or you
[42:15] haven't believed that he can help you
[42:17] yes
[42:20] and brother says god wants to mold us
[42:25] and make us what he wants us to be
[42:42] but if we want to continue to float in
[42:44] these waters well that's our own choice
[42:48] and i want to keep reading
[42:51] i said but let me tell you something
[42:56] you uh tonight on the in and outside of
[42:59] this building
[43:03] you're going to wind up at a destination
[43:06] one of these days
[43:10] that's going to be in the valley of the
[43:11] shadows of day
[43:14] prepare
[43:17] i would advise you at this hour to
[43:19] repeat to prepare to meet the god that
[43:21] you will have to meet at that hour
[43:27] you'll either meet him as a masterpiece
[43:29] that he has worked on
[43:35] or a floating piece of driftwood to go
[43:37] into your final destination
[43:42] so don't you use this life just to drift
[43:45] around and float around
[43:48] and get a better job
[43:50] and to dress better
[44:14] but there's higher ambitions in the
[44:15] human life than those things
[44:20] and christians should set their
[44:22] affection on higher ambitions
[44:27] brother venom says that whoever's on the
[44:29] inside or out
[44:31] you're going to reach one day at
[44:33] destination
[44:45] if you have the life of jesus christ
[44:47] within you or not
[44:49] your life will reach a destination
[44:56] let's not just use our life to be
[44:58] wandering wherever flotars
[45:02] floating aimlessly or without any sense
[45:04] of direction
[45:07] just because we want to be able to
[45:09] manage to get better things
[45:12] sometimes you as a human
[45:16] you uh take priorities
[45:20] on other things that is not church-based
[45:27] for example they gave me an overtime at
[45:29] work
[45:41] and then the other day the next day when
[45:44] service comes and then it's the same
[45:45] thing over again
[45:51] and then it goes by and then the next
[45:52] week again it's the same thing
[45:57] to such a point that you find out you
[45:59] actually left the church
[46:02] that the direction of your life ended up
[46:04] in a different place
[46:07] you began to float in a different
[46:09] direction
[46:12] you had a starting point
[46:15] he drifted and then got stuck in the
[46:17] garbage
[46:19] aimlessly and without any sense of
[46:21] direction
[46:24] that's why brother branham says
[46:38] if you become a masterpiece that became
[46:41] a boat
[46:44] you were able to go through those waters
[46:48] you're going to reach a destination
[46:54] but if you were just a a simple piece of
[46:57] floating driftwood
[47:00] you're just stuck in the water
[47:04] you also reach your destination but it's
[47:06] a different one
[47:10] [Music]
[47:32] people what they think that they have to
[47:33] do is be up to date with the fashions of
[47:35] the world
[47:37] and with the temptations of the world
[47:44] he says daniel when he was taken to
[47:46] babylon
[47:50] despite that he was abandoning his home
[47:56] and that he had to become a slave of
[47:58] people of different nations
[48:05] but daniel it didn't matter to him what
[48:07] they did to him in his heart
[48:13] he was not going to defile himself with
[48:15] the babylonian sin
[48:17] um
[48:21] and i now want to apply this to us the
[48:23] young people including me including
[48:25] myself
[48:30] that sometimes we think that at school
[49:01] that regardless of whatever they would
[49:02] do to him
[49:06] he would not defile himself with the sin
[49:08] of babylon
[49:10] we should do the same
[49:14] for
[49:32] because at school they say oh you don't
[49:34] want to smoke you don't want to do this
[49:35] you don't want to do that
[49:37] we'll just not hang out with you
[49:40] you're really boring
[49:53] because you know that there will be a
[49:54] day when you will reach a destination
[49:56] yes
[50:08] [Music]
[50:25] because the mind is playing tricks on us
[50:31] instead of helping us it's actually
[50:32] taking us out from where we should be
[50:35] amigos
[50:37] maybe you're with your uh so-called
[50:39] friends from school
[50:42] and they get together in a group and
[50:44] they're going to go do something
[50:47] maybe something bad
[50:49] because in the world they don't do
[50:50] anything that's good
[50:51] yes
[51:03] and then in your mind you begin to have
[51:05] these thoughts that say
[51:06] hello
[51:08] just go it doesn't matter if you nothing
[51:10] happens if you just do it once
[51:13] and then you can come afterwards repent
[51:15] and everything will be just fine
[51:22] and then that one time becomes another
[51:24] time and then another time and then it
[51:26] becomes an endless cycle
[51:29] that when you come to find out
[51:33] you
[51:34] ended up being stuck in this trash of
[51:36] the stream of life
[51:41] letting that water come in inside you
[51:44] tampo
[51:46] so rotten on the inside
[51:59] and it can get to the point that you
[52:01] look so firm oh look the brother is
[52:02] dressed
[52:04] he looks like he's a really good
[52:06] christian
[52:08] but you don't know what's inside that
[52:09] person
[52:12] that when the moment comes when a trial
[52:14] comes
[52:16] that
[52:25] and then they found out that the the
[52:26] inside was so rotten
[52:30] of so much time that they were stuck in
[52:32] that water can control salida that they
[52:34] could not find their way out
[52:43] and brother branham says when you have
[52:44] that kind of determination in your heart
[52:52] god will open the
[52:55] the doors of heaven and something has to
[52:57] happen
[53:04] you've got to get to business with god
[53:06] and have some purpose and some gratitude
[53:08] for him
[53:11] for him saving you
[53:24] if we have enough confidence and faith
[53:26] in him
[53:42] but if you come and say no i don't
[53:43] believe the lord can save me
[53:49] i don't think he would want to because
[53:51] uh a while ago i used to go to church
[53:53] but then i got i went away
[53:56] don't get tired of being on your knees
[54:03] keep trying to read your message and
[54:04] draw closer to him
[54:09] [Music]
[54:16] and a man that ever comes to god and
[54:17] really down in his heart finds a set of
[54:20] faith
[54:31] it'll stand good in the mouth of death
[54:33] or in the mouth of sickness or in the
[54:35] mouth of sorrow it'll stand good for
[54:37] faith is the victory
[54:40] you have overcome by your faith
[54:46] when you have faith then you are able to
[54:49] overcome whatever
[54:59] [Music]
[55:04] there is no power or anything that once
[55:06] you have the faith in the one that has
[55:07] saved you
[55:09] then nothing can hold you back from
[55:11] overcoming
[55:14] uh with this i'll be closing if you can
[55:16] please stand
[55:30] when you have it
[55:48] [Music]
[56:04] you are of god little children and have
[56:07] overcome them because greater is he that
[56:09] is in you than he that is in the world
[56:15] because greater is he that is in us than
[56:17] he that is in the world
[56:22] because his faith is in us towards him
[56:28] that faith is greater than whatever the
[56:30] world can do
[56:34] that faith is even greater from the
[56:35] world trying to hold you back
[56:41] let's uh let's put in our effort to not
[56:44] be floating through this life of the
[56:46] world
[56:49] and don't lose the faith
[56:54] sometimes it seems tough
[57:11] and i say it because sometimes you
[57:13] yourself you lose the desire to come to
[57:15] church
[57:18] and you even come to the point that you
[57:20] think what's the point of coming here
[57:23] i've had those thoughts
[57:34] but sometimes god works in an unexpected
[57:36] way yes
[57:49] because once the lord can show you that
[57:51] he can save you or there's a way they
[57:52] can he can show that he is with you
[57:57] that he can drive you forward out of
[57:59] where you are
[58:02] that's when your desire comes up again
[58:06] now
[58:15] sometimes you you feel like there's no
[58:16] point of just kneeling down and praying
[58:33] you're waging war against the
[58:48] you're trying to find a way to get out
[58:50] of that garbage where you're stuck in
[58:52] yeah yes
[58:56] and that's when he wants to attack you
[58:57] even more and more and more that way you
[58:59] don't keep going
[59:02] and that's why
[59:12] and do whatever he wants with us
[59:17] i'll be now giving the place to my
[59:18] brother
[59:20] and may the lord bless you
[59:22] [Applause]
[59:35] amen may the lord richly bless you
[59:40] uh
[59:40] just how you are i just want you to open
[59:43] your bibles you can open your bibles
[59:45] with me to um revelations chapter 3
[59:47] verse 10.
[59:56] and uh once you have it just say amen
[1:00:13] or my bad uh verse 21.
[1:00:21] that overcometh will i grant to sit with
[1:00:24] me in thy in my throne
[1:00:27] even as i also overcame
[1:00:29] and i am sat down with my father in his
[1:00:32] throne
[1:00:40] i just want to go over that again to him
[1:00:42] that overcome it
[1:00:46] i will grant to sit with me
[1:00:51] says to sit with me not over
[1:01:09] asico mojo
[1:01:10] and i am sat down with my father
[1:01:15] in his throne
[1:01:17] amen may god bless the reading of his
[1:01:19] word
[1:01:26] just like to um
[1:01:27] go over what our what my brother abraham
[1:01:30] said uh
[1:01:34] he was talking about how
[1:01:36] brother branham
[1:01:39] i'm sorry if you can please you can take
[1:01:41] your seats may be seated
[1:01:47] just want to go over on how our brother
[1:01:49] abraham on
[1:01:50] the message how can i overcome
[1:01:53] represent
[1:01:56] he talked about paragraph uh 41.
[1:02:01] he talked about that old log hey
[1:02:16] and when
[1:02:20] brother branham stepped on it or jumped
[1:02:21] on it
[1:02:29] and
[1:02:30] just like our brother uh abraham said
[1:02:56] and we just put it as a title
[1:02:57] [Music]
[1:02:59] but i just want to ask you this question
[1:03:01] right now
[1:03:03] are you really a christian this evening
[1:03:05] right now
[1:03:08] if god came through those doors right
[1:03:09] there
[1:03:12] can you look to him in his eyes and say
[1:03:14] it
[1:03:25] just want to
[1:03:27] go over the message on how i can
[1:03:42] and then there you you take a christian
[1:03:47] christian that's supposed to be a
[1:03:48] christian
[1:03:50] christian and let the life of god go
[1:03:53] from him
[1:04:20] so brother brother branham talks about
[1:04:23] how we call ourselves christians
[1:04:29] how we're supposed to carry ourselves
[1:04:30] like christians
[1:04:33] but just take away that experience
[1:04:37] just let the life of god just go away
[1:04:39] from him
[1:04:42] and brother branham says he rhymes twice
[1:04:44] as fast
[1:04:48] we can just go to paragraph 43 real
[1:04:50] quick
[1:04:52] so we're trying to follow the message of
[1:04:54] the hour
[1:04:58] or at least this part of the message
[1:05:02] we should live constantly in the life of
[1:05:05] christ
[1:05:15] and you know these things that you're
[1:05:17] supposed to do
[1:05:20] and you
[1:05:24] the bible said
[1:05:27] he that knows to do good and does and
[1:05:30] thus
[1:05:30] it not to him it's sin
[1:05:34] in
[1:05:48] man
[1:05:53] brother branham
[1:05:55] talks um
[1:05:57] talks about how
[1:05:58] you can be in the church
[1:06:44] when you're separated from the life of
[1:06:45] god
[1:06:49] now listen to this
[1:06:52] so strive with all that it's in you
[1:06:56] to stay in the life of christ
[1:07:01] that you would be fruit-bearing
[1:07:05] man brother branham is saying try your
[1:07:07] best
[1:07:08] [Music]
[1:07:10] to
[1:07:11] to make the best effort
[1:07:15] to put your whole
[1:07:17] mind and body
[1:07:18] to
[1:07:19] to gotti man
[1:07:23] man just put it in the hands of god
[1:07:26] incoming so that you may be a light unto
[1:07:29] this world amen
[1:07:33] like our brother abraham
[1:07:35] said um
[1:07:38] that uh
[1:07:40] he gave the example of the youth
[1:07:43] and he said that uh
[1:07:45] um
[1:07:46] that they might invite you to do uh
[1:07:48] worldly things amen
[1:07:53] and uh in your head you say well well
[1:07:56] i'm a christian right
[1:07:59] i'm a christian and you tell them uh i
[1:08:02] can't go you know i got church today
[1:08:04] let's say you got church today
[1:08:06] cristiano no puede porque bueno de gamos
[1:08:08] que hoytengorto
[1:08:31] and like the you say it's just a
[1:08:32] one-time thing
[1:08:35] but like our brother abraham said
[1:08:38] that one time thing comes into two es
[1:08:44] three four five entrees
[1:08:50] that's why brother branham says
[1:08:53] that we gotta be fruit bearing
[1:08:56] because we live in a world of sin
[1:08:58] [Music]
[1:09:00] and the bible says that we're a light
[1:09:02] unto this world
[1:09:14] [Music]
[1:09:31] so we can so we find here that god has
[1:09:33] always had overcomers
[1:09:38] in every age
[1:09:41] he's had overcomers
[1:09:44] there's always um every time in that age
[1:09:50] that there's been on earth
[1:09:53] god has always had someone
[1:09:57] he could put his hands on uh
[1:10:24] amen uh i believe we have uh we have
[1:10:26] examples in the in the bible
[1:10:31] i heard a brother one time said
[1:10:33] that some people call this a history's
[1:10:35] book
[1:10:41] or it's just uh it's just a storybook
[1:10:45] but i feel like this is a this is like
[1:10:48] our foundation
[1:10:51] and we have good examples throughout the
[1:10:52] bible
[1:10:55] who we can look through
[1:10:57] los cuales podemos mirar and they
[1:10:59] they've gone over the same thing that we
[1:11:01] have
[1:11:06] amen
[1:11:12] uh he so continue on on 52
[1:11:16] he that believeth in me has everlasting
[1:11:18] life
[1:11:23] and shall not come to condemnation
[1:11:28] or the judgment
[1:11:29] but yes passed from death unto life
[1:11:35] christ gave the promise christo
[1:11:38] that we would not even stand at the
[1:11:40] judge at the judgment
[1:11:44] so freely
[1:11:48] so freely that he take my place
[1:11:51] until i'm absolutely free
[1:11:56] amen when god i feel i believe that when
[1:11:58] god makes a promise you keep saying amen
[1:12:04] and i can
[1:12:05] and there's many brothers and sisters
[1:12:06] here that can say the same thing
[1:12:11] sometimes we may think that um
[1:12:13] you know god god is running late
[1:12:20] or god god's not hearing me
[1:12:23] but god god has this time
[1:12:28] it's not by my merits
[1:12:31] i can't do it by myself
[1:12:34] yes victor i
[1:12:43] praise god amen
[1:12:48] just keep reading
[1:12:50] so freely that he that he'd take my
[1:12:52] place
[1:12:55] until i'm absolutely free
[1:13:00] when i'm pardoned
[1:13:05] how can how can he take me out of the
[1:13:07] pawn shop
[1:13:10] if i got a clear receipt
[1:13:17] how can he be my redeemer
[1:13:20] and take me from the pawn shop
[1:13:23] and the broker says if you say
[1:13:26] that i still belong to him
[1:13:35] amen you see wrote by the blood of jesus
[1:13:37] christ
[1:13:41] now in that
[1:13:42] here where he uh we have come
[1:13:45] in
[1:13:49] so brother brandon i'm here at manom
[1:13:51] branham
[1:13:52] is is talking about uh the promise
[1:13:54] garmin established
[1:13:57] that we want to stand in
[1:13:59] at judgment
[1:14:02] and we're absolutely free under the
[1:14:04] blood
[1:14:06] absolutely
[1:14:07] amen and he's saying that that we have
[1:14:09] mercy
[1:14:12] that we have a clear receipt
[1:14:16] by the blood of jesus christ
[1:14:19] men how many believe we have that were
[1:14:21] seen this morning
[1:14:27] and uh paragraph 65.
[1:14:31] um
[1:14:32] we
[1:14:34] i
[1:14:35] want to go back on
[1:14:36] when
[1:14:38] we were saying that the bible has the
[1:14:40] greatest examples
[1:15:07] jesus referred to it jesus
[1:15:10] and said
[1:15:12] as it was
[1:15:14] in the time of noah so shall it be in
[1:15:16] the coming of the son of man
[1:15:21] in noah's time
[1:15:37] perhaps of millions of people
[1:15:40] there was about eight overcomers
[1:15:44] so in the time of noah
[1:15:48] there was only eight overcomers
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:17:00] he's
[1:17:00] a
[1:17:02] he's a type of today
[1:17:06] and uh how just there was eight
[1:17:08] overcomers
[1:17:12] and he's talking about how they did it
[1:17:28] now if if you're laying around
[1:17:32] getting a doughy daddy
[1:17:37] hurry quick
[1:17:39] because the door might close at any time
[1:17:57] the is the pastor you know is he busy
[1:18:01] he says you get in quick
[1:18:06] me
[1:18:07] get in there yo
[1:18:09] before the door shut anthony
[1:18:25] and there's always been an ark in god's
[1:18:27] economy
[1:18:31] there was an ark in the days of noah
[1:18:34] for the saving of his people
[1:18:38] there is an ark in these days of the law
[1:18:42] the ark of testimony
[1:18:44] in these days
[1:18:50] now i want to look at another overcomer
[1:19:05] brother branham says this is in the days
[1:19:08] of daniel and daniel's time
[1:19:12] there was four overcomers
[1:19:15] so instead of eight we have four now
[1:19:20] that could stand at the test of the fire
[1:19:22] and the lion pudiero
[1:19:27] now we're expected to be tested
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:37] uh it says he that cometh to god must be
[1:19:40] first tested
[1:19:45] and it says tested by what it is
[1:20:17] [Music]
[1:20:30] so don't just think that um you know
[1:20:33] you're a christian
[1:20:36] christian no you got baptized yeah
[1:20:40] but uh
[1:20:42] he's gonna be like oh everything is
[1:20:43] gonna be uh you
[1:20:57] because in order to overcome something
[1:21:01] there must be a test
[1:21:04] amen
[1:21:09] and in the scripture of peter
[1:21:11] it says
[1:21:13] that are that our trials are worth more
[1:21:16] to us than precious gold
[1:21:26] brother branham here says it's testing
[1:21:28] time okay
[1:21:31] and it says it's
[1:21:33] it's um it's one good evidence that god
[1:21:36] it's one good evidence to us that god is
[1:21:39] with us this is
[1:21:41] [Music]
[1:22:00] daniel was the prophet daniel prophet
[1:22:03] and that was the size of the church
[1:22:04] today
[1:22:07] or i mean the bride
[1:22:10] there's lots of church aviabastante
[1:22:13] about two million of them
[1:22:16] but there was um that that was the size
[1:22:19] of the overcomer
[1:22:36] you take back the
[1:22:38] uh the word says
[1:22:43] or you be thrown into the fiery furnace
[1:22:47] they refuse anything but the word
[1:22:54] and just just to paraphrase the
[1:22:56] paraphrase
[1:22:59] brother branham uh continues on that uh
[1:23:01] they threw uh meshech uh hamrick and ben
[1:23:04] to go to the fiery furnace
[1:23:10] but god always has our back
[1:23:14] if you have god's back
[1:23:17] and if you're an overcomer
[1:23:21] god will have your back
[1:23:24] the bible says that god was in the
[1:23:26] middle
[1:23:27] of
[1:23:28] the three hebrew children
[1:23:46] brother branham says that it doesn't
[1:23:48] matter if you're thrown into the fire e
[1:23:50] di cinema bronchi no importa series
[1:23:52] into that same fiery furnace uh
[1:23:55] a few years back

[1:24:05] not even a flame
