us this is the second time here yes uh my wife's cousin el primo de miesposa who i consider my cousin you know i wanted to to say thank you to the the young men we made extension or an invitation to the young men of jericho uh you know to have some fellowship outside of church we've tried to do breakfast and dinner and things you know because we see each other in church with the suit and the tie all the time dressed our best in acting our best but what about the christian life that we have outside of this church to be able to have some nice christian healthy fellowship [Music] but we look forward to having some of those young men next time for some good healthy fellowships and i don't want to keep you standing too long if you'd be so kind as to turn in your bibles to matthew 22. no quiero montenegro de masado tiempo si and we're going to be reading from verse 34 to verse 40. and the title this morning and it's going to be agapo number two i didn't plan for this to transpire into a number two or a number three or number four no um but as a subtitle i'd like to uh if we could say corrections so this is the scripture we read last time we were up here and it reads but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together master which is the great commandment in the law maestro is the grandmother jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two commandments hang all the law and all the prophets prophets we thank you lord for another opportunity to be in your house lord we ask you father that you would take preeminence in this service senor te and to continue to love our brother and love you is in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated brothers if you'd like to keep your bibles open uh if you'd like to turn in galatians chapter six to try and give an uh a start to our subtitle corrections brethren if any man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted bear ye one another's burdens and soul fulfill the law of christ so i'm gonna read it from another version for a dummy like me different person that helps me understand this a bit es says dear brothers and sisters if any other believer is overcome by sin if any other believer that's to your right or to your left that becomes overcome by sin you who are godly should gently and humbly help that person back to the right path and be careful not to fall in the same temptation yourself and i like verse 2. share each other's burdens like a brother eli preached a long time ago so has that heart have that understanding for your neighbor your brother your sister you can share that burden by simply listening to them and as the scripture says and in this way obey the law of christ in such doing so we can obey our opening scripture to love god with all our hearts and to love our neighbor or our brother with all our hearts in the message titled the approach to god did you ever know that every son that cometh to god must first be tried whipped child whipping correction since it's not easy god will give you a real old-fashioned spanking for it i don't want to expand on that no expander but i think that's a pretty good statement for my brother we can just give a little bit more of that to our children so he gives you a little whooping so that you can get straightened up that little daughter that's a little rebellious needs that little whooping to straighten up papa god with that rebellious son he has needs a little whooping so he could straighten where i could say i love them more after that whooping and yo on the contrary i did the same thing my father did yeah he got whooped so much i got whooped so much my father used to give me weapons and i thought oh my i wish i could just call that that old gray-headed brother father he says i would respect every weapon that he ever gave me i never got even as much as i needed i thought so then but i don't what a lesson the prophet teaches us with that his dad wasn't living right we know the errors that our mother and our father have in the homes but nonetheless they want the best for us so i can respect i love how brother branham says that foreign mom and dad gave me cadase because it corrected they wanted the ultimate goal for me to serve the lord jesus christ with all my heart what about the heavenly parent the lord jesus christ he has to correct us not he might correct us but he wants to correct us then we become illegitimate children of god doesn't matter if it's an elder sister elder brother if they come and approach you without a gop that makes you an illegitimate child we have to be able to withstand correction is necessary correction says if you're really born again this is then there's nothing that can separate you from god absolutely nothing nada in absolutely brown says that's right this is neither starvation nor perils nor trials nisikera suffering death nothing can separate us from the love of god you might be saying well brother sometimes it's just too much you know there's too much correction upon correction and correction always going through these trials and tribulations the suffering is just too much for me well if we can suffer with him now we can suffer with him on this earth in this flesh now then we will reign with him tomorrow he embraced the suffering that was put upon him while he walked this earth off the suffering that we go through in our christian walk christiano is what molds us into the character of jesus christ and he went through the ultimate suffering suffering all the way to the last breaths of his life when he was facing death face to face to let this cup pass over me why have you forsaken me he was suffering but he suffered so that he can be that agape love love can give us eternal life that we can be born again by the holy ghost through that agape love temptation in there but with christ there are no days off we are carrying that cross daily and daily and daily and daily and he says follow me and keep on going it makes me think of the the hiking trip we took on saturday with the young men mensah we've got to climb trees and jump over rocks and maybe squirm through cactus and things like that but the path was already paved for us the footsteps were already set out for us to get to our destination and the path is already set for us to get to that capstone love it is this brother what it's supposed to produce let suffering produce in your life what it's supposed to produce in your christian life romans 5 3 says and romano cinco tres disen says not only so esto but we glory in tribulations or sufferings knowing that this suffering worketh our patience the wife you said i do to at the altar que es esposa for about nine months isn't the same exact wife you said i do too at that altar i need a little bit more patience they start getting their own little ideas and ways of thinking at school i need a little bit of patience to deal with that i need patience to deal with my brothers and sisters here necessarily it's not that we don't like each other no i was raised this way you were raised that way yes that can help us love one another well you know what the remedy is you know they're suffering it it makes me it makes me get this bitterness this depression is the more i suffer the more hatred i start to get for people well it's just a simple question are we in the spirit are we in the flesh are we in the spirit or are we in the flesh the bible says that which is born in the flesh is flesh and i know every one of us are born in the flesh but that which is born of the spirit is spirit the bible says and somebody in here has got to be born of the spirit this morning somebody probably could say it confidently you know we got those humble brothers too yes brother that's i've been born in the spirits there's some who don't even know i don't know if i've been born again yet or if i haven't been born again but there might even be someone here this morning they're saying i know i haven't been born again jose you can be born of that spirit this morning so everyone that's been born of that spirit let's let's read this scripture here for those of you that said it confidently i've been born again of that spirit who shall separate us from the love of christ or distress well in my version of the bible it doesn't say what shall separate us from the love of christ what the tribulation what the distress what the persecution it says who shall separate us there's a who that's bringing all these afflictions on us these are attributes of that who is he allows me to go through the suffering i'm going through right now this morning but it's satan the one who's inflicting those things upon you he thinks satan thinks that he's kicking you down and bringing you down but the truth is god is just trying to lift you up lift you up he's trying to take us to a higher place through that suffering that we're going through so we need to stop giving satan the power over us nothing can separate you from the agapo love of christ nor can satan separate you from the love of christ if agapo and that experience brings forth hope the bible says hope in the agapo love of god that's in every one of your hearts the bible says that's given to us by the holy ghost but says in the message led by the spirit of god this is preached in 1956 when and thy staff they comfort me this is in the book of revelations even depicts it as a rod of iron like when you're scared and mama comes and gives you that warm hug to make you feel good for example they let me know this is that god is with me que dios esta con migo because he corrects me from all my wrongs somebody got wrongs this morning better believe god's going to correct you of those wrongs well bryan says maybe he's trying to correct you tonight why don't you let the rod and staff comfort you the hard preaching of the gospel from the pastor the it's that hard preaching of the gospel that's that rock is the predication says it's a comfort to let me know that god speaks to me que vios when that type of gospel is being preached to correct me correction legitimate sons of god we need to accept that correction many times it's from the ministry to the sheep is the ministerio and then many times that correction comes from the sheep to the ministry you know but you know when you said that about what brother branham said he says he didn't really say that correction you know when you read that part of the bible the bible doesn't mean that us that's correction you know brother marcos when you heard me that other day hermano marcos that's corrections when i first started the relationship with our brother michael when you come and send me relations brother michael started walking with the footsteps of the lord i remember i told him you know he started growing a fondness for me and we started establishing a friendship and i wanted to make sure that he knew clearly i said not even not be of available own choosing i might even do it unconsciously without even thinking because i want you to know i'm just a man so take your eyes off any man make sure to always keep them on christ because no matter how much of a friend i can beat to you how much of a brother i can be to you que clase de hermano yo polo man is still prone to making mistakes but the spiritual man spiritual the spiritual man is prone to accepting that correction is they comfort me commodities says he loved me he wants me to walk with him so that he can walk with me in that hour parker you know so now we've come to a place we understand you know god loves me with this agape love and now with that agape love now i can give some of that agape love and with that agape love i can now embrace the suffering that i go through in my life because now i know suffering builds my character of christ so i'm now a legitimate son and daughter of god because i love corrections well let's read first john 4 20. it says first john 4 20. if a man says i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth god and loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen he says but okay let's correct that i love god i just don't like my brother man gusta manuel no just the way he is i just don't like him too much i've been falling in love with the concordance lately and maybe if i can give you some homework you know go look up every time the word love is used and find when it's used in the sense of filio and when it's used in the sense of agapo logo de la morphilo and you'll see how many times we need to use that higher level of love i love god with that heavenly love that capstone love celestia what i hate is my brother then he is a liar you cannot agapo god and filio your brother agape as soon as he stops doing those things i start running out of that love for him but when you've got that agape love it's an unconditional love never-ending love that no matter how much he offends me no matter how much he he speaks bad about me just like jesus at the cross it didn't matter what they said about him jesus there's nothing we can do to make him love us we hear his voice when he speaks to us you know we we hear his voice that we recognize when he's talking you know we stop paying your ties and then you know a month down the road you fall into some great financial crisis in your life right away i've seen your correction lord please forgive me you know you're you you cheat your brother in a business deal and maybe in a week or so at work someone cheats you out of a job or some money in kisas and the light switch turns on oh this is god correcting me and so on and so forth example after example after example somehow we accept and we recognize this is a form of god's judgment or god's punishment the correction he's trying to bestow on me for something i've done or or lacked doing la corazon it seems like it's just so easy to accept and you accept it and you embrace it and you ask for forgiveness but somehow when it takes place in here but this when we get some heavy correction from inside the church from this family of believers i want to read the scriptures says moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear ye hear thee thou has gained thy brother so if your brother has sinned against you entonces has has uh offended you done something to hurt you is saying uh nice and clear go with him in privacy go express yourself to him go talk to him and it says if he shall hear you if you say you have gained your brother back so there is an opportunity between you and him to fix the situation if you can come in that love if you can project that love love but can receive it through the love you projected to him or he already has that love but just made a mistake and your love and his love come together your holy spirit and his holy spirit come together that sin or that offense is rectified one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established there can still be a gobble up maybe you couldn't project the words that needed to be said necessarily but maybe the deacon you took with you can you oh bro you took with you he can ela because we're still trying to gain our brother back even though he made a mistake even though he committed an offense towards 17 says and if he shall neglect to hear them then tell it to the church then bring that case to the church and if you neglect to hear the church is then let it be unto him let him be as a heathen man and a republican as a sinner a heathen or any other tener that can end up in a judgment that needs to take place like verse 15 says commodities for the sole purpose to gain thy brother back but now we have a different example of correction both of these are scriptural ambos both of these are valid both both of these can and should be applied second corinthians chapter two second for out of much affliction and anguish of the heart i write which i have for you is i have more abundantly unto you don't be sad with this letter that i'm writing i want to let you know i love you more than you even imagined this correction that this brother was given this judgment that this sister was given it's sufficient yeah it's enough yes she's been through enough already she's gone through enough uh suffering already from that yeah but paul is trying to say that and he says which was inflicted of many it could have been inflicted of the many of that family towards that person it could have been inflicted of many the whole church towards that one person but he's saying it's enough that's enough punishment that's enough suffering go and comfort that brother go and comfort that sister via consular alert it says lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with over much sorrow we leave them out to die we leave them out in the wilderness we leave them out in that punishment that judgment los jamos de castillo in a sequel that correction that led them astray and correction they left them all alone out there if we live let that be see that and we can't come to a point of forgiveness a point of comfort that we can extend to them al punto de el consuelo that person is going to be swallowed up with spirits of depression of maybe suicide of sorrow all that you would confirm your love toward him once again this love is este in the concordance to confirm your filial toward him he deserved to hate that man that killed his son that can love him no matter what that person's done i forgive in the person of jesus christ i think verse 11 is for those that were a little more mature because paul is telling corinthians corinthians if we don't do this and the accused will fall into a spirit of hate to the audio or resentment he says because we cannot be ignorant of the devil's devices because that is what the devil wants he wants separation he wants division he wants enmity he wants you to hate your brother and sister on your side let's turn off those fleshly eyes let's shut off that filial love of his flesh and get into the spirit we claim we're born in this spirit de la cuatro and start to project to our brothers and sisters that have offended us because we're not ignorant of how the devil operates my brother ricardo did la costa queso del mano ricardo the word says that requires judgment you know some of us we can stand on the word over preserving a human relationship embezzy of reconciling the reconciliation of forgiving the pardon of restoring and rescuing you know brother just don't say that about brother man you don't know the situation he's in description if you knew the circumstances that he had to go through that's why he said what he said that's why he acted the way he acted i have a little bit of grace for my brother have a little bit of mercy and understanding for my brothers but if we're not careful both of those can fall into an error almost that's why we read the two different types of corrections standing on the word el para la palabra calling out the sin exponent bringing the correction and giving is also backed up by the word espaldado por la palabra if we are all judgment and no grace we're out of cater estamos fuera de orden if we're all grace and never give anyone judgment but this word will pull you here and it'll pull me here and that agapo love and correction will keep us right down the center yes i'm starting to close now yeah i want to share a couple of testimonies when i first arrived here to phoenix and speaking about correction trying to be respectful and honest within the first couple of months that i lived here shortly after brother johnny passed this was the key for you know johnny i was out at walmart one night with my wife and my family family and walmart we had to pick something up and just put some clothes on real quick and i found a deacon of jericho tabernacles and he sees me and greets me hello brother marcos how you doing hello marcos como estas we talked for about 30 minutes 40 minutes i don't know how long hour and he starts talking to me and he says oh brother you remember when i saw you there at walmart the other day yeah you know brother uh well you know i'm nobody to tell you and this is and i know the brother knows who i'm talking about but in a good spirit in that agape love he said brother uh the clothing you were wearing it was not convenient or uh it's not prudent for you to dress that way and he started to explain to me why and the reasons and everything i hope you don't get scandalized by this brother marcos still has that sodom and gomorrah spirit from california hanging on him maybe that was the last one that i had to kind of kick off my body i don't know but uh it wasn't that i was shirtless or skulls or the crazy clothing nothing like that but the brother in that love starts to explain it to me why it's not prudent to have been dressed that way and he used examples of his children and his family and brothers so that i could understand clearly that this was being given in love now right away i have the option immediately who is this brother yesterday this isn't wrong esther is my lord i can show this to everyone in church and nobody will say this is wrong but this is a deacon that this church voted that this church believes has a certain wisdom of the word world he is my elder elizabeth and he came to me to express something that is of my benefit beneficial if he didn't have a gap loved and i didn't have a gap there is no way i could apply that correction in my life i took it i accept it and i applied it i appreciate it well brother you know it's easy to take it from a deacon they're the police of the church if brother says that barks at me i'm gonna get to running what about anybody else what about our sisters what about our elders and there was an elderly sister there having her auntie forgive me and she greeted me [Music] d [Laughter] you know it's up to me is my body going to receive it or reject it and and the sister says uh brother marcos you know how how you been and so on hey marcos [Music] these are some tapes that i don't listen to anymore but i think they'll be good for you in your ministry and and right away i could have thought in my mind what does this sister think she is i've been praying preaching for so and so years and i know so much and this and that yeah i could have think that way oh yes sister i really appreciate it thank you gracias she keeps going and she says i don't see your fellowship no more this is it's it's i haven't seen a long time no le vista mucho tiempo oh sister you know we get busy and things happen oh no i understand oh i see yo yo and i get emotional because the next word she says i didn't get emotional then but now i reflect on it and she says you know your wife it'd be nice if she starts coming and that she might be able to have but some more friends mas amigas now i shared something at the at the youth fellowship or the youth breakfast we had we didn't have friends amigos we didn't have anybody and how we've been longing for friends and not so much me necessary for me you know i grew up in this christian walk yo christine is the camino christian but more so for my wife and and i get emotional right now because you know the elders are the wisdom of the church and for some reason you know an elder sister like that who can just sit back and just observe because there's a certain sense of experience that you can't buy at the grocery store experience and maturity and wisdom that comes with age and that was a form of correction for me yes una forma de correction for me that she projected so much agape love to me okay that instead of rejecting the words that she said instead of getting offended at the the the recommendations that she gave embezzle recommendations i took them in la and i applied them and i put them into effect into my life every christian born of the spirit should accept corrections you can tell when it's coming from a place of agape love whether it's from your younger brother whether it's from the pastor it doesn't matter no important correction can come in many different shapes and sizes speaking when my father first began his christian walk during that time as he explained where my mother was taking away from him brother if you know brother jimmy garcia garcia and various brothers from here in phoenix along with my father they all worked in construction in the construction a few names just to name some brother paul uh i believe brother alex baroona worked here as well and there was also a brother by the name of billy contreras now this brother billy had spent some time here in phoenix uh our estermano billy avia posado um he knew a whole lot about the message and about the bible now i know this testimony because it's been told to me ever since i was a little boy all right i wasn't born yet i was born in 1989. and so when my father just come into church he called me padres he had already been in for some time but as my dad came in he started to drift out and at that stage my dad didn't understand too much about the message of christianity but my dad brother jimmy brother billy they all work together in the same place and since he billy didn't go to church anymore but he still went to work my dad was like his handyman and he would always tell him about revelations and preach to him about the bible and stimulate him with that first love my dad is and he starts to talk to him about his condition in the church the way he's been living because he was living in a state of fornication at that time so he had taken my dad as a witness now the testimony is brother billy never fought back he was decent he was very polite and for you to pray and to meditate and brother jimmy called my dad to go see billy again as a witness billy billy you know have you thought about things yeah it's been 30 days now yeah i'm going to have to apply that which paul says in the scriptures and still billy in a good spirit iona sibili well composed comportado didn't fight back we could say uh he had an agape spirit to him not of contention or fighting he just had a mistake that he made in his walk jimmy said well that's fine brother no if you're not going to fix anything that was a wednesday i'm going to do something that i've never done in my life first it's reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication that is not named among the gentiles and you are puffed up and have not rather mourned and and that he had that has done this deed might be taken away from you he was established in the name of the lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together in my spirit with the power of the lord jesus christ deliver such a one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved on the day of the lord jesus jesus my dad and brothers testify that there was an atmosphere so heavy that wednesday night at church like never felt before he says to the point where they were up there behind the pulpit trembling and as brother jimmy was giving that sentence to turn that brother into the hands of satan my dad says i'd never seen brother jimmy cry before in my life and during that sentence well that same weekend semana brother billy went to phoenix billy for phoenix i believe there's brothers here that know brother billy and he went to see brother paul and brother bernie el foravera he spoke to brother paul pablo and after a week from that sentencing it is a sentence we have a freeway there in california the 94. in california and he swerved off the exit of that freeway in his truck brother paul mentioned after brother billy's funeral el mono pablo mentioned because brother billy died that day that when they had spoken god gave him an opportunity to straighten up his life but he didn't choose to do so so god had to take his life because he wouldn't be able to live the life now that there wasn't a single wound or bruise on his entire body in that
