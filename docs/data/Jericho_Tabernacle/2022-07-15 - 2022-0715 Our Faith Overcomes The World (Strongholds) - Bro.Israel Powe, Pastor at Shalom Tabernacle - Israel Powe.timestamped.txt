[40:04] I'd like to greet his family his their
[40:07] wife and his family wherever they may be
[40:09] family
[40:17] as I Was preparing for the service
[40:19] tonight
[40:23] this uh thought on strongholds had God
[40:27] was dealing with me and
[40:34] in the scriptures in Revelations chapter
[40:37] 2.
[40:40] the Bible is talking about the
[40:42] Overcomers that overcome
[40:46] and he talked about how the Believers
[40:49] knew where Satan's seat was
[40:57] and so the prophet takes and he goes in
[41:00] great length talking about what Satan's
[41:02] seat was
[41:06] of course we know those are spiritual
[41:08] things
[41:11] Satan doesn't have a seat that he sits
[41:14] in is
[41:17] talking about how it was Satan's
[41:19] dwelling place
[41:23] and how he had a foothold in this
[41:27] particular place here in pergamas
[41:34] scriptures called it Satan's seat
[41:38] and going further into the message
[41:41] the prophet of God talks about Kentucky
[41:46] his home state is
[41:49] he referred to it as Satan's seat for
[41:53] whiskey and alcohol
[41:59] you talked about how 90 something
[42:01] percent of all the whiskey come through
[42:05] Kentucky that little State
[42:11] it's not that other states didn't have
[42:13] whiskey
[42:15] but this it was more pronounced and more
[42:19] profound in Kentucky
[42:22] and he called it say conceited
[42:26] then he goes further and he talks about
[42:28] Paris France
[42:32] and he chooses Paris France out of all
[42:36] of the other countries on the globe yes
[42:42] identifies Paris France
[42:45] Francia they call it the Rat Hole of the
[42:48] world
[42:51] because from this little place here it
[42:54] would influence the rest of the world is
[43:06] set in the pace
[43:10] for other nations to follow
[43:14] calls it Satan's seat
[43:17] and then he goes further and says that
[43:20] this seed of Satan moved into Hollywood
[43:27] Hollywood
[43:32] and it moved into Hollywood
[43:36] and Hollywood is now
[43:38] Hollywood is
[43:40] and it's influencing the entire world
[43:46] through their movies
[43:52] it influences other nations
[43:56] now this these sins go on every place
[44:01] but it's more pronounced in Hollywood
[44:03] foreign
[44:25] also refers to it as the stronghold of
[44:28] satanos
[44:32] this is a place where it's hard to it
[44:37] would be harder to preach the gospel
[44:41] yes he said that about Kentucky
[44:45] it was the birthplace of whiskey and it
[44:48] was a stronghold for
[44:52] and to preach the gospel in that place
[44:55] was very very difficult
[44:59] and as we look and we think of other
[45:02] cities
[45:04] when you think of San Francisco what do
[45:07] you think of San Francisco
[45:11] San Francisco
[45:14] what do you think of in San Francisco
[45:17] they're known for it
[45:21] homosexuality
[45:23] sexual immorality
[45:26] it's all over the globe
[45:29] but it's more pronounced there is
[45:34] Las Vegas what do you think of Las Vegas
[45:38] think of gambling
[45:40] a prostitution
[45:43] you think of the city life
[45:47] These are these are these are
[45:50] strongholds of
[45:52] satanas now the way the prophet brought
[45:56] to us the spirit world
[46:01] he takes the scripture in Matthew
[46:04] chapter 12 in Luke Chapter 11.
[46:09] any in and these are the words of our
[46:12] Lord Jesus talking about an unclean
[46:15] Spirit when it leaves
[46:21] and brother Brandon gave this
[46:23] instruction in Divine Healing yeah
[46:27] I'm not going to preach long all right
[46:30] you all work with me okay
[46:34] and and if we can refrain from going to
[46:37] the bathroom can you hold it just for a
[46:39] little bit
[46:42] it's almost like some people come to
[46:44] church to hydrate
[46:47] you don't have water at home you get to
[46:49] church that's when I'm gonna drink my
[46:51] water come on
[46:53] you could just take and I won't preach
[46:56] long all right
[46:58] but brother random takes these
[47:00] scriptures of our Lord Jesus
[47:03] and he makes it very Vivid to us
[47:07] Jesus says when an unclean Spirit leaves
[47:10] from a man
[47:13] this isn't a physical thing
[47:16] These Are Spiritual things that take
[47:19] place when an unclean Spirit leaves from
[47:22] a man
[47:24] how many Believers here tonight
[47:28] you used to have one
[47:31] unclean Spirit
[47:33] the spirit that kept you from repenting
[47:37] Spirit
[47:41] every minute had an unclean Spirit on
[47:44] them
[47:45] they had to be delivered
[47:50] and so Jesus Jesus tells us in Matthew
[47:54] chapter 12.00
[47:56] and in Luke chapter 11 in Lucas what an
[48:00] unclean Spirit leaves from a man
[48:04] he goes into dry places
[48:10] seeking Wrath buscando reposo
[48:13] and when he can't find rest
[48:16] comes back to the house that he left
[48:19] from
[48:21] so it's taken out
[48:24] he can't find another place to go
[48:28] so he goes back to what's familiar with
[48:30] him
[48:32] and when he comes back to this house if
[48:35] it's found cleaned is
[48:41] but it's not filled
[48:43] he brings other Spirits with us
[48:47] seven other Spirits
[48:50] how many understand that
[48:52] in one place brother Branham says he's
[48:55] eight times worse
[48:58] this happens in Divine Healing
[49:02] it also happens when man is making his a
[49:06] step towards God
[49:09] he hears the gospel truth
[49:13] and then the gospel truth takes the
[49:17] unbelief off of him
[49:20] he's delivered and set free
[49:24] for time
[49:26] to go on and receive the holy ghosts
[49:34] the spirit that used to have him bound
[49:37] is coming back
[49:42] Jesus said it will come back
[49:44] and if we come back to the house and
[49:47] call it his house
[49:51] and then the individual is actually
[49:54] worse
[49:57] if they were not filled
[50:00] please don't gloss this over por favor
[50:05] this can't happen to you because you in
[50:07] the message
[50:08] please don't think this doesn't happen
[50:10] to our young people at our campus
[50:13] foreign
[50:48] the prophet of God takes in the message
[50:50] y'all read a quote
[50:54] in the message expectations he says this
[50:57] here is
[51:01] talking about Moses how they started to
[51:04] march with Moses
[51:07] they didn't go very far until they got
[51:10] into some
[51:14] troublemas every time when you start to
[51:17] make a March for God
[51:21] look out you're headed for trouble
[51:26] the devil's going to lay right along the
[51:29] path there
[51:32] to get every foot in he can get
[51:37] he will trip you
[51:40] upsets
[51:42] do everything mean
[51:48] oh I just love to pour the scriptures on
[51:51] him don't you
[51:53] know yes sir say it's written the word
[51:56] of the Lord that's right
[52:01] says the devil hates me they say
[52:04] and I know he hates you too
[52:08] he's my enemy it is but as long as God's
[52:13] my friend I don't have no fear
[52:17] I just drive him right on back
[52:21] take the word of God and move him right
[52:25] on back out
[52:26] is
[52:28] out of the place that he thinks he's
[52:30] holding
[52:33] he hasn't got no strongholds
[52:37] he's absolutely legally defeated in
[52:41] every place
[52:45] the devil hasn't got one legal right at
[52:50] all
[52:50] absolutely
[52:55] he's just the devil Diablo and a
[52:58] password that's all
[53:00] he hasn't got no legal right to any man
[53:03] that'll accept the promise of Jesus
[53:06] Christ
[53:11] yes sir he's whipped in sickness
[53:16] whipped in disappointment
[53:19] he's whipped in everything
[53:22] he's whipped in death
[53:25] he can't scare me
[53:28] he can't scare you
[53:31] that's all he's a big old Shadow is
[53:36] how many thank God for that
[53:39] Satan has no legal rights
[53:43] that's God's word to you this is
[53:46] God's word to the Believers
[53:49] Satan hasn't got no legal rights
[53:54] now he has his stronghold
[53:57] and the message expectations brother
[54:00] random says this year amen
[54:28] the prophet of God continues
[54:31] just a couple quotations I want to read
[54:33] for you
[54:35] he says
[54:39] he's talking about the how the nations
[54:41] came together to fight against communism
[54:43] and against uh Hitler yeah
[54:49] and he's talking about this big four
[54:52] conference
[54:55] he says uh uh
[54:58] they wanted to put their armies
[55:02] in a certain place
[55:06] like the Fifth Army in the fourth Army
[55:08] in the tenth Army
[55:13] how they could work together
[55:18] where the enemy had a strongholds
[55:22] and if you notice
[55:24] they always try to hit the spinal cords
[55:30] that's the lifeline yes
[55:33] it's always
[55:37] if you
[55:45] don't you don't kill it
[55:48] and so therefore just one thing to be
[55:51] done
[55:56] it talks about fighting the enemies
[56:05] you want to strike it where it hurts the
[56:08] most
[56:12] and our real weaknesses
[56:17] the real problem
[56:20] for many of our youth today
[56:23] and many of our fathers and mothers
[56:26] today
[56:29] what's the real problem
[56:32] and that real problem has to be hit
[56:36] right at the right at the central part
[56:39] of it
[56:42] you don't you don't want to do this just
[56:45] to look like you're doing okay
[56:49] you don't go up to the altar just to
[56:52] show other people look I'm going to
[56:55] go into church
[56:59] pray just so everybody can know that
[57:01] you're really a spiritual one you this
[57:04] ain't about that
[57:08] but it's finding the spinal cord of the
[57:11] enemy
[57:12] is
[57:14] a general enemy I'm talking about your
[57:17] enemies
[57:19] finding the spinal cord of your enemies
[57:28] to kill the enemy in your life
[57:31] because Jesus paid for delivery
[57:51] and that's for a Believer Jesus
[57:55] so we strike the spots
[57:59] that really hit the hardest
[58:04] yes sir I see us
[58:09] I was listening to a testimony of
[58:10] brother Billy
[58:12] Pauly Paul and and he gives his
[58:16] testimony different times and different
[58:18] ways
[58:21] they talked about how he got away from
[58:23] the Lord
[58:26] and he did all kind of things out there
[58:29] in the world
[58:32] finally he gave his heart to the Lord
[58:34] Jesus
[58:37] on his on his deathbed he was dying
[58:41] he had a major surgery he was up foreign
[59:04] they're just about to operate operate on
[59:06] him
[59:08] he had a rupture in his side
[59:11] and the doctors can do nothing to help
[59:14] him
[59:17] he saw his dad coming to the hospital
[59:26] he says that will you pray for me
[59:31] and brother
[59:33] I didn't do any sinning
[59:37] I'm not going to pray for you
[59:39] you did
[59:42] you do the praying
[59:46] times we think we're going to get out of
[59:48] this without us fighting ourselves
[59:50] sister
[1:00:03] know how to handle the swords
[1:00:08] that don't know how to turn their backs
[1:00:18] and there's a whole population of our
[1:00:21] youths
[1:00:23] 15 to 20 years old
[1:00:27] they're like missing in action okay
[1:00:33] we got to do a youth meeting for you
[1:00:35] want to want the youth do your youth
[1:00:38] meeting for you
[1:00:41] pray for you when are the young people
[1:00:44] going to come and pray for me
[1:00:48] factors
[1:00:52] foreign
[1:01:08] [Applause]
[1:01:18] so brother Billy says
[1:01:21] his dad told him
[1:01:23] I didn't do the sinning
[1:01:26] so you need to do the praying
[1:01:29] because they're in the hospital bed he
[1:01:31] gave his heart to the Lord Jesus
[1:01:36] and was serving the lord
[1:01:40] he said there was one last thing that he
[1:01:42] couldn't overcome
[1:01:45] and that was the cigarettes
[1:01:48] he said he would smoke
[1:01:51] ask God to deliver him
[1:01:54] he would throw him out
[1:01:56] throw him away
[1:01:59] and then you find himself back smoking
[1:02:01] again
[1:02:03] and this went on for some time yes
[1:02:07] the cigarettes were a stronghold to him
[1:02:16] but he said that one day they were on on
[1:02:19] the road traveling together and he had a
[1:02:21] pack of cigarettes in his pocket there
[1:02:23] on the side this is
[1:02:30] and he said he thought he would try to
[1:02:33] slide him down just a little bit and he
[1:02:35] thought he could hide him from his dad
[1:02:37] but he said you couldn't hide nothing
[1:02:38] from my dad
[1:02:44] he said brother
[1:02:53] he's like
[1:02:56] he said yeah because see he said right
[1:02:59] at that moment he took those cigarettes
[1:03:01] out and he threw him out of the car
[1:03:04] they're driving down the road like this
[1:03:06] here
[1:03:09] what did you just throw out the window
[1:03:11] yeah
[1:03:13] I threw those cigarettes I threw those
[1:03:16] cigarettes and the cigarette lighter out
[1:03:17] the
[1:03:18] windows
[1:03:21] have you ever done that before
[1:03:25] yes many times
[1:03:27] this is where you sincere when you did
[1:03:30] it
[1:03:35] he turned the car around and went back
[1:03:37] to where the cigarette pack was
[1:03:42] and he says Billy you you committed this
[1:03:46] to Lord many times
[1:03:58] let's set let's set a memorial here
[1:04:15] and he never took another one
[1:04:18] I thought that was beautiful
[1:04:21] how to deal with strongholds
[1:04:24] you know the scriptures in Hebrews
[1:04:27] chapter 12
[1:04:29] it calls them sins that so easily beset
[1:04:33] us
[1:04:36] is Hebrews chapter 12.
[1:04:39] it says this here Lisa
[1:04:42] seeing we are compassionate about with
[1:04:44] so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:04:48] let us lay aside every weight in every
[1:04:51] sin which does so easily be said
[1:04:59] brother random called these sins
[1:05:09] he talks of Moses
[1:05:11] he says Moses is besetting sin this is
[1:05:19] and that was that was the thing that
[1:05:22] constantly came up
[1:05:25] it constantly bothered him
[1:05:29] brother random talks about the woman at
[1:05:31] the well
[1:05:36] he says he says go get your husband
[1:05:40] he found her trouble foreign
[1:06:45] he says maybe you got an Affliction
[1:06:50] maybe you got a habit
[1:06:53] maybe somebody said in sin that you
[1:06:56] can't lay down
[1:07:01] something has blocked your road
[1:07:05] he calls that a besetting sin is
[1:07:10] something that you can't lay down
[1:07:15] in one place it said it's something you
[1:07:17] can't overcome
[1:07:20] it's it's something that keeps coming up
[1:07:25] it's it's the thing that easily upsets
[1:07:28] you is Gusta
[1:07:31] he prays a prayer
[1:07:33] and he says this here in his prayer
[1:07:37] God I pray that you'll answer every one
[1:07:40] of their requests
[1:07:42] they're standing here now their heads
[1:07:45] are bowed their hearts bowed
[1:07:51] you're their God
[1:07:53] they're confessing they're wrong
[1:07:56] they're wanting to be right Lord
[1:07:59] they want all belief taken from them
[1:08:05] let their little be said in sin
[1:08:09] that does so easily upset them
[1:08:13] let it be taken from them tonight
[1:08:18] and never to return again
[1:08:23] I love those prayers
[1:08:25] because there's a finality to them
[1:08:29] we don't want to learn how to live with
[1:08:32] our sins
[1:08:34] we want to be able to divorce from
[1:08:37] ourselves
[1:08:43] some of us sitting here tonight
[1:08:46] no doubt have some strongholds in our
[1:08:49] lives
[1:08:55] they're spirits that get on you
[1:08:59] they hang on
[1:09:01] they block you from going further into
[1:09:04] the law is
[1:09:07] but we need to serve notice on the devil
[1:09:10] tonight
[1:09:16] that you want to make the Rapture
[1:09:19] no matter what it takes
[1:09:22] no matter what it calls
[1:09:30] Lord whatever it takes
[1:09:33] to get me ready for the rapture
[1:09:40] us to pray a prayer like that
[1:09:43] desire a prayer

[1:11:38] here
[1:11:41] the prophet of God makes this statement
[1:11:44] here
[1:11:47] he makes a statement in the message what
[1:11:50] it takes to overcome all unbelief
[1:11:55] it says when God speaks to a man hombre
[1:12:00] he has Faith
[1:12:03] he has ambition

[1:12:12] he gives them a purpose
[1:12:15] when God speaks to a man
[1:12:18] he gives him ambition
[1:12:21] when God speaks to a man
[1:12:24] he gives him Faith to do it
[1:12:27] to accomplish or achieve
[1:12:30] what his purpose is in life
[1:12:35] but God called him to do
[1:12:39] has called us to be in the Church of God
[1:12:45] Amen I love that
[1:12:48] he gives them ambition
[1:12:51] what's this word ambition mean

[1:12:59] typically require find determination and

[1:17:29] a man one time was trying to seek God
[1:17:34] and every time he'd say I'm saved
[1:17:39] the devil would say

[1:18:45] do that you drive down the stakes and
[1:18:48] you point right back to it
[1:18:52] amen amen
[1:18:55] Ma I have so many quotes
[1:19:01] so many places
[1:19:03] but I was reading this
[1:19:07] um
[1:19:09] one of the doctors from the Stanford
[1:19:11] University
[1:19:15] Robert I think is how he says his name
[1:19:18] and Dr Roberts yeah
[1:19:21] he was talking about the
[1:19:24] The Wiles of the internet and the social
[1:19:27] media yeah
[1:19:32] now everybody rolled their eyes yeah I'm
[1:19:34] gonna get on it
[1:19:39] the social media the Facebook
[1:19:43] Twitter Instagram
[1:19:45] the Snapchat the Snapchat they listed 13
[1:19:49] of the the most popular ones
[1:19:54] the engineers that create these devices
[1:20:01] they have the attention Engineers that
[1:20:05] are that that created these devices to
[1:20:07] keep your attention focused on them
[1:20:13] and he uses this phrase he called it the
[1:20:17] the magic of maybe yes
[1:20:23] it calls it a fragmented attention
[1:20:29] that you constantly like maybe somebody
[1:20:31] sent me a text or maybe but somebody
[1:20:33] sent me an email maybe so they got to
[1:20:35] continually in this fragment it that
[1:20:38] your your attention is on your phone
[1:20:40] but yeah we're eating having lunch
[1:20:41] together but you keep looking at your
[1:20:43] phone
[1:20:44] um
[1:20:56] none of y'all have this problem here
[1:21:03] but the the magic of maybe maybe is
[1:21:06] maybe some and once yes
[1:21:09] you look and nobody snapped you or
[1:21:11] nobody sent you a message
[1:21:15] and then you go back and you look again
[1:21:17] and nobody snapped you or said you know
[1:21:22] it gives you a little reward there
[1:21:25] maybe they did
[1:21:29] what got me now these are not preachers
[1:21:32] these are these are scientists
[1:21:35] these are Educators what got me was was
[1:21:40] this right here
[1:21:41] the one doctor said that that this
[1:21:45] fragmented attention
[1:21:48] where you're you're in it but then
[1:21:51] you're out of it then you're back in it
[1:21:52] and out of it it says
[1:21:55] this can permanently reduce
[1:22:01] capacity to concentrate
[1:22:05] and he said permanently
[1:22:08] and I thought wow that's that's pretty
[1:22:10] strong
[1:22:12] and they talked about the depression
[1:22:14] that goes along with it and how people
[1:22:16] can't focus
[1:22:20] I steady on one thing
[1:22:24] or advertising and all the things that
[1:22:28] are trying to sell us all the time
[1:22:34] and then your attention is all
[1:22:37] fragmented you got to fidget you got to
[1:22:38] get up you got to walk around you gotta
[1:22:40] do something
[1:22:45] and this constant fragmentation that we
[1:22:50] can't keep your attention
[1:22:55] you want this service to be like a TV
[1:22:58] program you can fast forward television
[1:23:04] acceleration
[1:23:05] fast forward to the song special
[1:23:08] to see who's in the crowd
[1:23:11] definitely fast forward the preaching if
[1:23:14] definitely
[1:23:15] let's get right to the let's all stand
[1:23:18] and be ready to be dismissed everybody
[1:23:26] the preaching is going on it's just
[1:23:28] white noise
[1:23:34] but his coming is nearer than it than it
[1:23:36] ever was
[1:23:40] and this really this really shocked me
[1:23:42] yes
[1:23:44] that the doctors are saying this is
[1:23:48] and then we wonder why
[1:23:51] I'm going to say this here and it might
[1:23:53] be a little irresponsible but I'm going
[1:23:54] to say it because I feel too
[1:23:57] irresponsible and if it's wrong it's
[1:24:01] wrong but I really I really feel this
[1:24:05] there's some of us here
[1:24:07] that will never go further with god
[1:24:12] with the social media
[1:24:15] you're not you're not going to get no
[1:24:18] further with God
[1:24:19] whatever is between you and the Lord
[1:24:23] that is your god

[1:27:50] I think my hour is about yeah
[1:27:57] let me read
[1:27:59] something to you from the prophets
[1:28:06] you can find it here quickly
[1:28:15] mm-hmm
[1:28:18] yes
[1:28:24] here
[1:28:28] here is an answer
[1:28:31] to your stronghold
[1:28:34] to your besetting sins
[1:28:39] it's found in the Old Testament Psalms
[1:28:44] chapter 16.
[1:28:47] this is
[1:28:50] David says
[1:28:51] I've put the lord always before me
[1:28:57] I have set the lord always before me
[1:29:06] that I would not stand against him
[1:29:11] here's brother Brandon's prayer he's
[1:29:13] part of the prayer he says this here
[1:29:16] he knows all things
[1:29:19] he knows your heart
[1:29:23] and you know what and you know what
[1:29:25] you're thinking he does too
[1:29:30] he says if they're
[1:29:31] if there's a little sin hanging on you
[1:29:33] tonight
[1:29:36] and you wouldn't want to go in the
[1:29:39] presence of God with that on you you
[1:29:41] said
[1:29:44] would you once more raise up your hand
[1:29:47] and say brother Brandon pray for me
[1:29:52] excuse me says I want to be in the
[1:29:54] presence
[1:29:55] in his presence at that day
[1:30:01] guiltlessension God bless you many hands
[1:30:03] God sees it is
[1:30:08] now I'll tell you what you do
[1:30:12] just listen closely
[1:30:15] do like David did
[1:30:18] put the Lord before you right now
[1:30:22] put the Lord between you and that sinan
[1:30:27] whatever
[1:30:29] that little besetting Center
[1:30:34] it might be lying it might be stealing
[1:30:38] it might be evil thinking
[1:30:42] it might be temper it might be drinking
[1:30:46] it might be smoking it might be gambling
[1:30:52] I don't know what it might be less
[1:30:56] it might be anything
[1:30:59] I don't know what it is whatever it is
[1:31:04] put the Lord before
[1:31:07] then your heart will rejoice and
[1:31:12] your flesh shall rest in hope is
[1:31:16] for you know that Christ promised he
[1:31:19] raised up again in the last days
[1:31:25] when he comes forth we'll come in his
[1:31:28] likenessa
[1:31:32] amen amen we'll take one more scripture
[1:31:35] in second Corinthians chapter 10.
[1:31:39] yes number three two five
[1:31:43] [Music]
[1:32:01] thank you
[1:32:03] for the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:32:05] carnal But Mighty through God
[1:32:09] to the pulling down of strongholds
[1:32:17] casting down imaginations
[1:32:20] and every High thing that exalted itself
[1:32:23] against the knowledge of God
[1:32:29] and bringing into captivity every
[1:32:32] thought to The Obedience of Christo
[1:32:39] how many thank God for that
[1:32:45] these what's up accounts

[1:33:52] God bless you so much
[1:33:59] my prayer for you today is this is
[1:34:13] that God will speak to you
[1:34:18] because when God speaks to a man
[1:34:21] he gives him faith
[1:34:25] he gives him ambition ambition
[1:34:28] he gives them something to do
[1:34:32] when God speaks to a man
[1:34:36] he gives them a purpose
[1:34:39] when God speaks to a man
[1:34:43] he gives him ambition
[1:34:46] I'm quoting when God speaks to a man
[1:34:51] he gives him Faith to do it
[1:34:54] to accomplish or achieve what his
[1:34:58] purpose is in life foreign
[1:35:13] you know it starts with a simple prayer
[1:35:19] while you're there in your seat there

[1:35:27] to drive a stick down this evening
[1:35:33] I want you to think
[1:35:35] what is keeping you okay
[1:35:38] from going further with the Lord

[1:35:58] they're in church but they're not really
[1:36:00] they're not in the fight they're not in
