that you might do what you need to do bless your people and bless the part that remains of this service we ask you for all of this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen [Music] we're going to go to the book of Hosea uh chapter 6 and we're going to start with verse [Music] one hose is between the Book of Daniel and the Book of [Music] Joel you can say say Amen when you have it the word of the Lord says come and let us return unto the Lord for he hath torn and he healed us he hath smitten and he bind us up after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the [Music] Earth may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be [Music] seated it's something rather funny Marcos and I have the same suit onday so I believe we have the same Spirit from yesterday that on at the wedding we had on the same suit so we decided to do the same thing this morning so now right here in Hosea it speaks that there's a group of people they're going to go back to the Lord they'll have a former and a latter rain last time we spoke on the former and latter rain but for the Gentiles but this former and latter rign this for the Jews brother brandom says in the message recognizing your day and its message now notice carefully that after two days now that didn't mean 2 24-hour days cuz there's been that's happened way back Yonder many hundreds of years ago see it meant two days with the Lord after 2,000 years now you know how long it's been since that time it's been 2700 years since that because here in Hosea it's BC 780 1964 you see it's been something over 2700 years ago he said after two days in the third day he will revive us again and give us light in his sight there's where the trumpets coming in that's the hour that we're living the day that we're living now they've been scattered blinded gathered and are far into the third day you see it they were scattered from Palestine to the whole world they were blinded to reject the Messiah and now they've been gathered in their Homeland ready for the trumpets to recognize the atonement so this prophecy of Hosea it speaks about how it is that the Jews they were in different nations of the earth they were spread around different parts of the world because 2,000 years ago when Jesus Christ the Messiah came they were blinded and they rejected him and the punishment of that they were expelled out of their promised land they were expelled out of their Homeland the Bible says that the Jewish people it's God's people so then God in his grace being that they rejected Christ there's no way to have access to the baptism of the Holy Ghost but God is still trying to return them back to their Homeland so that once in their Homeland they're in the promised land God can finally reveal himself to them the same applies to every one of us here if you're not in the right position in the promised land in Christ God will bring you back so that then finally he can reveal himself unto you a good example of this isth is in the story of ruthu in Ruth 1 now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife and his two sons and the name of the man was AMC and the name of his wife Naomi and the name of his two sons was mean and chilon ephra of the Bethlehem Judah and they came into the country of Moab and continued there now remember when the Jews 2,000 years ago they rejected their Messiah the gospel it started to go from the Jews unto the Gentiles now here we have Naomi and her family leaving the promised land and they go into a gentile Nation brother brand says the message why little Bethlehem Naomi representing the Orthodox Church was went on the account of famine entered into the land of Moab like the scattering of Israel all out among all the nations and as she came back she brought back Ruth the moabit and she returned just in barley season just the Gathering in of the first barley that is the Gentile Church coming to God just barely at The Barley season again so then at the same time when the Jews go back to their Homeland the Gentiles that had been scattered from the original word that was brought in the beginning they're also being restored unto their Homeland but our homeland first of all it is is to be in Christ Jesus now Naomi it says in Ruth 13 now just observe what God needed to do for Naomi to come back verse three says and ELC Naomi's husband died and she was left and her two sons and they took them wives of the woman of Moab and the names of one was orpa and the names of the other Ruth and they dwelt there for about 10 years now notice it was for 10 years and mean and chilon died also both of them and the woman was left of her and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband now Naomi she's of the tribe of Juda now in the Old Testament when Solomon was alive when Solomon had a sin that he committed he fell in love with women that were not of his homeland he fell in love with many Pagan women God told him to be careful because those women would cause for his heart to get distant from God and that's what happened because of that God punished Solomon by SP in the Kingdom of Israel I believe brother also spoke of this when he spoke on the Kings of Israel one kingdom was the kingdom of the north it had 10 tribes now these were 10 tribes Naomi was in Moab for 10 years then the second kingdom was the kingdom of the South that had two tribes the Bible says in First Kings 11:11 wherefore the Lord said unto Solomon for as much as this is done of thee and thou Hast not kept my Covenant and my statutes which I have commanded Thee I will surely Ren the Kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant not withstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father's sake but I will Rend it out at the hand of thy son how be it I will not Rend away all the kingdom but I will give One Tribe of to thy son for David my servant's sake and for Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen now verses later down into in 29 and it came to pass that at the time when jeroboam went out to Jerusalem that the prophet aijah and shilonite found him in the way and he had and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in the field and aajan caught the new garment that was on him and rent it in 12 pieces and he said to jeroboam take thee 10 pieces for thus sayith the Lord the god of Israel behold I will Ren the Kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give 10 tribes to thee but he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake and for and for Jerusalem's sake the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel now 10 were for a certain Kingdom and one tribe was given to David so these were two it was David that was the tribe of Judah and the other tribe that was given to him brother brandham says in the message the countdown notice the natural man even counts backwards I said he did things backwards he counts backwards watch his count 10 9876543210 you you see he goes back and starts counting he's all 10 is a bad number that's right to start with 10 it's a bad number they had 10 tribes of Israel and them was just all carnal so then the kingdom of the north that had the 10 tribes that was the carnal part of Israel Naomi going to Moab for 10 years she lived a carnal life for 10 years she came out of the promised land because God can only bless you with his spirit in the promised land so then the the kingdom of the South it was Judah and there was another tribe let's see what that other tribe is in First Kings 12:20 and it came to pass when all Israel heard that jeroboam was come again that they sent and called him unto the congregation and made him King over all of Israel there was none that followed the House of David but the tribe of Judah only so jeroboam was the king of the king of the kingdom of the north now in verse 21 it's it speaks of another man that will be the King of the South and when reob rooam was come to Jerusalem he assembled all the house of Judah with the Tribe of Benjamin so the tribe that was added unto the House of David to the tribe of Judah that was the Tribe of Benjamin now these aren't just scriptures of the past this also applies for today now remember when Naomi left the promised land she left as a backsliding woman she left the promised land just like Israel as a nation she backslid because they were blind to not accept the Messiah so then the gospel could go first from the Jews unto us the Gentiles now in Zechariah 137 awake oh sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow sayith the Lord of hosts Smite the shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered and I will turn my hand upon the little ones do this say it says if you attack the pastor the shepherd the Sheep will be dispersed in John 10:14 it says Jesus himself speaking I am the Good Shepherd and I know my sheep and I am known of mine even as the father knoweth me and I know the father I Lay My Life down for the sheep and other sheep have I which are not of this F them also must I bring they'll hear my voice there shall be one F and one Shepherd so Naomi leaving the promised land in a backsliding condition then goes to Moab was with the intention to find to get Ruth to bring her back to the promised land now remember Judah and Benjamin they're connected so when the the gospel left the Jews and was in transition of going from the Jews to the Gentiles the seven Church ages began and the first messenger it was Paul Paul is of The Tribe of Benjamin in Romans 11:1 is sayth then hath God Cast Away his people God forbid for I also am an Israelite of the Seed of Abraham of the tribe of Judah of The Tribe of Benjamin so now if we jump over to Philippians 3:4 though I might also have confidence in the in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he that he hath whereof he might Trust In the Flesh I more circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee so remember Jud and Benjamin one way or another they're connected and Naomi leaving the promised land it was Judah and Benjamin leaving the promised land Ruth Andi going back to the promised land that's Judah and Benjamin going back to the promised land now in the message questions and answers on the seals brother Bram says in the days of Paul the angel of the Church of Ephesus Paul founding this church being the messenger to it remember Paul founding the church at Ephesus became the messenger to that church and the Spirit was in the land at that time was The Lion and the lion is the lion of the tribe of Judah which is Christ and Christ is the word Paul with the word of that age so when Naomi leaves the promised land it's Judah and Benjamin leaving behind the promised land going unto Moab representing the Pagan Nations now in ruth6 after Naomi lived her carnal life now remember these two kingdoms the one of the north it had 10 tribes those were carnal the one of the South it had two now God's true people is never called to live a fleshly life but we're in this flesh sometimes it happens that we we fall or we backslide God never wants for us to stay in that carnal condition if we backslide he's got a process to bring us back to the promised land so then Naomi she was not of the kingdom of the North she was of the kingdom of the South supposedly she needed to live a life in the promised land a life led by the Holy Ghost but she backslid being that she represents the Jews she was predestinated to eternal life God had to bring her back God doesn't lose the ones he saves God doesn't lose those he's predestinated your carnal decision if you decide to live carnally God will bring you back through much pain and suffering but that carnal decision that decision you made to live carnally and not live through the Holy Ghost in no way will that affect your salvation in heaven it just affects your life here on Earth but onto eternity what God Saves it's saved God doesn't go back on things on the decision he's made about his salvation but your carnal decision it affects your life here on the earth will not affect your eternal life now in ruth6 then she arose with her daughters in the law that she might return from the country of Moab for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the Lord had visited his people in giving them bread wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters-in-law with her and they went out unto the way to return unto the land of Judah so Naomi returned but Ruth the moabitas her daughter-in-law with her which returned out which returned out of the country of Moab and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley Harvest now remember Naomi she had two daughters that was Ruth and orpa you've been called to not live a carnal life but in the beginning you're in a carnal condition but you weren't called to live that carnal life you were called to live a life got led by the spirit you were called to live in the promised land so there was a separation Ruth between Ruth and Ora just like a separation of the 10 carnal tribes and the two tribes that would be led by the spirit but now these two tribes though they were led by the spirit they backslid into their carnal nation into their caral condition but since they're predestinated God has to bring them back to their position so then when Naomi and Ruth they go back to the promised land that was during The Barley Harvest now you use barley to make bread Just Like Us in every age we've had our bread our mana and Mana was bread that fell from heaven now the scripture that we read in the beginning Hosea chapter 6 verse three then shall we know if we follow unto know the Lord for his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the Earth brother Brown says in the message the spoken word is the Original Seed the the word former is the Hebrew word Mor which means teaching in other words it'll be a teaching rain and a harvest rain now we've had a now we've had the teaching rain now we're ready before the Harvest rain you know the first rain is when you plant the seed that's when they planted the barley seed that crop starts growing then just before it matures there comes another crop that's what they call the Harvest rain we know when that is the the spring rains then it rains about June it makes your crop now the rain we find out was the spirit so then when Naomi and Ruth they're going back to the promised land Naomi representing the Jews Ruth the Gentiles there's a rain that's falling down upon the promised land that rain brother brandham says in various parts of the message it says it's a Revival now during these time periods when there's seven Church ages and the Seven Church ages they're being led by the spirit because they have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Jews they were scattered from their Homeland to different parts of the nation of the world brother brandham gives some teachings they're in Leviticus 23 and he says in the message recognizing your day and its message now we noticed last Sunday that there was preaching of the feast days there was a feast of Pentecost and between the Feast of Pentecost and the Feast of trumpets there was a long period of time exactly 50 days between Pentecost and the Feast of the trumpets and 50 days which Pentecost means 50 it was the shef waving the first fruits Harvest was brought in and we see that it was a type back there with the natural first fruits representing the first fruits of the Holy Spirit to be poured out upon the people then we find out that them 50 days was received by the Gentiles which God called from the Gentiles a people for his name the Feast of Pentecost and we've been going through that long Feast of Pentecost now to call uh to call there would be the seven days of the sabbaths and that represents the seven Church ages to be called during the the Feast of the Pentecost to call a people from the Gentiles for his name now at the end of these seven sabbaths that have passed there was to be a day of atonement which was the seven trumpets and the Seven trumpets was to call a day of mourning back for the sacrifice or the atonement and we find out then that Israel the seven trumpets pertained only to Israel now remember it was Naomi that left the promised land it was Judah and Benjamin they left the promised land to be carinal it was a backsliding condition God's got to take us back to the condition so during that time when God wants to restore us God uses two Feasts the Feast of Pentecost which is for the Gentiles and the Feast of the trumpets it's for Israel now these two feasts there is something similar because both have trumpets one is literally called the Feast of the trumpets and us under the Feast of Pentecost we've had seven messagers with seven messages seven trumpets and our trumpet it's the gospel now the difference between these two feasts is that the Feast of Pentecost it gives access to the Believer by receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the Feast of the trumpets it just sounds the trumpet and natural things happen in the life of the person that punishes them and takes them back unto the promised land because only in the promised land can God bless you if you're not there God has to take you back somehow so then the Feast of the trumpets there's no access to the Holy Ghost because they were carnal and in saying carnal basically it's saying to live a life without Christ without the revelation of his word you can be in church come to church and be a carnal believer Traditions dogas doctrines but without the love of Christ without revelation of the word of God in your heart so you as an individual your spiritual life can be under the life of the Feast of Pentecost where you should be under the baptism of the Holy Ghost being led by the spirit God working through you but if you've backslid under the Feast of the trumpets where you become carnal and that carnality the Bible says is enmity with God if you decide to live a carnal life remember it doesn't affect your salvation but it does affect your spiritual life here on the earth you remember Saul he went against God's people and in that time he didn't have a prophet to go to so the Bible says that he went with a witch brother brandham says being that in that time period they were not under the grace they were under the law under the blood the blood of bulls and goats so she could call the prophet Samuel from where he was and Samuel talks to Saul and says why have you called me being that you've now converted yourself to an enemy of God and said tomorrow you'll be here with me where was Samuel he was already in Paradise his carnal life our carnal life doesn't affect our Salvation if we've had the experience that we've accepted Jesus Christ as our savior but if you after the experience you deliberately decide to live carnally that carnal life can take you onto a premature death you weren't called to live carnally you weren't called To The Feast of the trumpets you were called to the Feast of Pentecost so Saul lost his life prematurely but he never lost his salvation so don't ever allow the devil to lie to you your mistakes here on the earth after you converted to a Christian by no way will it affect your salvation by no means it only affects your life here on the Earth brother Bron says in the message recognizing your day and its message Israel's in her land drove them in there hered them there like sheep the loaves got the Wolves got after them and it run them back to safety to their own land remember Israel is only promised to be blessed as long as she was in her land God never blesses Israel outside of the land Abraham went outside the land and was condemned everyone that leaves the land is condemned God can only bless is Israel when she stays in her Homeland remember it's Naomi and Ruth that went back to the Homeland now Benjamin and Judah they went back to their Homeland brother BR says in the message questions and answers on Hebrews number two now when the end time comes when we're getting down to the end if I see it right the gospel in here there's supposed to be a great Revival now did you know that the that the Jewish flag is the oldest flag in the world and it's been laying dormant for 2,000 years more than that about 2500 years that Jewish flag the Sixpoint Star of David never flowed for 2500 years since the carrying away of Babylon and when the Roman Empire took over them and the Messiah come and they rejected it and they were scattered to the Four Winds of the Earth but did you know that on May 6th 1946 that that flag came back over Jerusalem again did you know that on May the 7th 1946 one day later the angel of the Lord appeared to me and sent me up into the whole world to bring forth a Revival the very next morning when that flag was raised in Jerusalem as the going down of the Sun that afternoon the angel of the Lord appeared here in the United States at the same time so during the time of brother brandham during the time of the promised restoration of those that are of the promised land Judah and Benjamin the Jews go back literally to their Homeland and brother brandom literally has to go through the na to the Nations to take out a bride it's Judah and Benjamin going back to the promised land but now with brother bradam it's a spiritual Revival but now with the Jews it's a literal Revival they don't have the spirit the Jews today have access to the spirit Gentiles but now both they're going back to their Homeland now the message recognizing your day and its message now at the end of these seven sabbaths which has been there was to be the day of atonement which was the seven trumpets and the Seven trumpets was to call a day of M back for the sacrifice or the atonement now if you read in Leviticus 23 there's seven Feasts the Feast of Pentecost the one which the whole Gentile church it's under that Feast that Feast it gives access to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the revelation of Jesus Christ but the Jews they're under the Feast of the trumpets those trumpets it caused them to pay the price because they rejected the Messiah the punishment was to be cast out of their Homeland but they've also got to come back to the Homeland they're also a part of the promised land God can only bless them if they're in the promised land now remember number number 10 is the number of the carinal nature now then after the Jews under the Feast of the trumpets they go back unto their Homeland now God can reveal himself to them he can now bless them to the next Feast which they go to is the Feast of the atonement the atonement it's the offering made for sin for The Sinner now Leviticus 2326 and the Lord spake unto Moses say and on the 10th day of the seventh month there shall be a day of atonement what day was this on the 10th day number 10 is the number of carnality the Jews are carnal right now because they don't have the Holy Ghost they go back onto their Homeland they go back they now go under the Feast of atonement and on the 10th day of that month they'll have a holy convocation and you shall afflict your souls verse 28 you shall do no work in the same day for it is a day of atonement to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God I like how it says it in Spanish because you are backslid when you enter under under the Feast of atonement the reason why it says that your soul is affli Afflicted because you've recognized you've left the promised land you've left the Lord but you're predestinated God brings you back and you recognize what was your mistake right here on the earth that's why there's an Affliction in your soul you recognize the mistake you made in the past but since you're predestinated there's no way to be lost you were called to live under the Feast of Pentecost you decided to live carnally or you made a caral decision God restores you through much much persecution many tests many things that happen to you you go from the Feast of the trumpets to the Feast of atonement and you recognize where you decided to start living carnally what was your carnal mistake that's why it says that your soul will be an affliction you'll notice where you made a mistake all that is the grace of the Lord though you decided to live carnally not under the grace of the Lord that gives you access to the spirit God will use the Feast of the trumpets to take you back and then the Feast of atonement so you can recognize your mistake where you left Christ when you recognize your mistake you repent sincerely then something you do you go back to Calvary you repent again and the Jews go through the same process on a bigger scale you just as an individual if you leave the Lord God will restore you but you'll have to repent once again because of the mistake you made in the past but by no means by no means will it affect your salvation nor your position there in eternity but it can take you to a premature death you remember brother brandham when he obeyed his mother-in-law remember Naomi for 10 years she was out there in Moab brother Bram around the year 1936 that's when he went to those meetings for that Revival they invited him to go preach at their churches he was going to do it but his mother-in-law said I don't want you to do that I don't want you to take my daughter with that bunch of trash the prophet listened to his mother-in-law instead of listening to God because he used the ministry of the Prophet to bring a Revival a lad rain unto the gentile people they got access to the reain of the Holy Ghost they're under the Feast of Pentecost because of that single carnal decision the flood came one year later in Jeffersonville he lost his wife and his daughter because of a single decision of Disobedience to God but by means didn't affect brother brandom's salvation nor the salvation of sister hope your life here on the earth after you accept Christ if you backslid by no means will it affect your salvation by no means will it affect your eternal life but it will affect your life on Earth you weren't called under the Feast of the trumpets you weren't called to be a Jew a carnal Jew you were called to be a Jew Paul says that's the Jew of the heart brother BR says that's a Christian filled with the Holy Ghost you weren't called to be orpa that was in the carnal land of Moab you were called to be Ruth that will leave that carnal land and go to the promised land but if you backslide God's going to take you back by no means by no means does it affect your salvation we're under the grace but your decision will affect your life here on the earth you should listen to two messages brother Brandon preaches the fifth seal and the Feast of the trumpets in the fifth seal the Bible speaks about there are souls under the altar those Souls now see brother BR makes an emphasis on this they'd ask for vengeance because they were killed here on the earth brother brand says if those Souls were Gentiles or members of the Bride they would not ask for vengeance they'd speak like Ste Steven when they were stoning him and killing him he said father forgive them but these Souls that were under the altar they received white robes they received salvation but they never had the opportunity to accept Christ here on the earth they never entered under the Feast of Pentecost they're under the Feast of the trumpets they were they were blinded by God himself so that you and I we can come under the Feast of Pentecost under the baptism of the Holy Ghost and in that Feast you're led by the spirit you've got the revelation of the word of God the Jews though they're the people of God they don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they have the revelation of Jesus Christ that he's the Messiah but they had to pay with their life for the carinal decision that their forefathers did by rejecting the Messiah they go back unto their Homeland under the Feast of the trumpets they go to the Feast of atonement when Christ reveals himself to them through two prophets Moses and Elijah he starts to reveal himself and they start to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ that's why brother Ram says this same message that we have one day will go with the Jews the same message that we have the same latter rain the same baptism of the Holy Ghost will go with them and they'll have their Revival not literally they've already had it they're in their Homeland they have a spiritual Revival the baptism of the Holy Ghost recognizing that Christ is their Messiah and nonetheless their soul will be afflicted they'll recognize they their Messiah that's when these scriptures are fulfilled in Zechariah 136 and they shall ask unto him what are these wounds in thine hands and then he shall answer those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends now Zechariah 1210 and I will pour upon the House of David what was the House of David Judah you and Benjamin the Jews if you backslide this scripture is for you you were taken back unto your Homeland taken back unto the Promised Land it's only by grace that you can enter into the promised land because Moses brother brandham says represents the Law that just took them to the border of the promised land but Joshua as Grace representing the Holy Ghost them into the promis land so then when it says that I would pour upon the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem Spirit of Grace that's the Jews the backsliding people that are going back to their Homeland going back to the Lord going back to the Holy Spirit and of prayer and will see me whom they pass and they shall mourn for him as one that mourneth only for his son and shall be bitterness in him as the one of the bitterness for his firstborn they go through the process of the feast to be restored to their Homeland you'll go through the same process because you're also of the House of David you're of the house of God and our David is Christ you go through the same process if you leave God by no means by no means does it affect your salvation it affects your life here on the earth remember brother brandom he was invited to go preach to those churches like around the year 1936 and then in 37 the flood came it was about 10 years later that the Lord then appeared to him brother Bram says in the message a life his life story oh my there it was and here's where I made my mistake friends I listen to my mother-in-law instead of listening to God and if I would have went ahead then this great thing would have been manifested before this and the church had been farther along our carnal decisions maybe they just affect us maybe they affect others and for that reason God will make you go through that Feast it's going to take you back to the promised land for God to bless you and bless others through you so then the Jews they go from the Feast of the trumpets to the Feast of atonement they recognize Christ as their Messiah they accept what he's done Christ is not sacrificed once again he doesn't have to shed his blood once again they just simply accept what he's already done what they do they go back to Calvary they accept the sacrifice he made on Calvary you do the same thing you make a mistake you recognize your mistake Christ doesn't have to shed his blood once again for you the blood is still fresh you go back to Calvary how do you go back to Calvary repenting and confessing your sins they go from Feast of trumpets to the Feast of atonement there they accept Christ as his as their Messiah they accept him as their savior then they go onto another feast in Revelation 14 verse one and I looked and lo a lamb stood on the Mount Zion and with him 144,000 having his father's name written on their foreheads now notice the 144,000 they've got his name and the name of his father and Christ said when he was here on the earth I've come in the name of my father the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ Christ so these 144,000 they have his name and his father have already accepted Christ as their savior he says in verse two and I Heard a Voice from Heaven and the voice of many Waters and as the voice of a great Thunder and I heard the voice of Harpers harping with their hearts now they're playing music they're they're in a feast and they sung it as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the 144 th000 which were redeemed from the earth these are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins these are they which follow the lamb withs soever that he goeth these were the redeemed from all from among men being the first fruits unto God and to the lamb the Feast of the trumpets where they don't have the spirit but they're predestinated they're taken back to their Homeland Feast of atonement they recognize their mistakes they repent they accept Christ as their savior he gives them entrance into the promised land in the spiritual sense under grace now they have access to the Holy Ghost now they go onto the Feast of the first fruits and the first fruit it's the Holy Ghost you also will go through the same process you and being carnal don't allow that the spirit lives as it wants to in you and guide you but you being restored you're restored back unto the joy of your salvation brother Bram says David never lost his salvation he lost the joy The Joy brother brand says is the anointing of the holy spirit it's that rain that falls from heaven let us stay stand if the musicians could come forward let us pray our good Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for under this feast of Pentecost we've got access to that wine that was shed on the day of Pentecost which is the revelation of Jesus Christ that today reveals to us if we're not in the condition we need to be if we're not located in the position here on the earth you've got a process to restore us but it will cost us so much to voluntarily disobey you but help us Lord give us of your grace give us of your mercy so we can recognize here on the earth that we left you at some point we can go back onto Calvary accept once again the life of Christ that comes upon us and can lead Our Lives help us Lord if someone in here is not where they need to be I ask you fulfill your scripture take them through those feasts they can recognize their mistakes can repent and you'll fulfill where it says in Zechariah I will shed upon the House of David the spirit of Grace lead and and Minister unto every heart for they are your house Lord you are our David we ask you this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God
