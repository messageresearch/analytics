[32:45] thing help us and also bless
[32:49] us for we ask it in the name of the Lord
[32:52] Jesus Christ amen
[32:56] amen
[33:00] just as we're standing we're going to
[33:01] read our scriptures to Exodus
[33:04] 19 uh Chapter 19 Verse
[33:25] 5
[33:28] now therefore if you will obey my voice
[33:30] indeed and keep my Covenant then you
[33:34] shall be a peculiar treasure unto me
[33:36] above all people for all the Earth is
[33:47] mine and ye shall be unto a kingdom of
[33:50] priests and and holy nation these are
[33:54] the words which Thou shalt speak unto
[33:56] the children of
[34:00] Israel and may the Lord add his Blessing
[34:02] to his reading of his word you may be
[34:07] seated we also want to thank the
[34:20] musicians now on this chapter
[34:25] 19 let's say well we've come to a very
[34:27] crucial
[34:31] point that the people of Israel find
[34:33] themselves
[34:35] in it's a
[34:38] chapter now if you study it throughout
[34:40] the
[34:42] message it's when the people of
[34:47] Israel changed the grace that they
[34:50] had into great uh
[34:55] law and brother random says in the
[34:57] message the uh
[35:00] Paradox now if we
[35:08] notice then their Journey uh then their
[35:12] journey in the wilderness is
[35:14] where they got their greatest
[35:19] mistake uh that Israel ever made until
[35:25] Calvary
[35:27] was when in Exodus 19 they accepted law
[35:29] instead of
[35:31] Grace they had
[35:33] Grace they had a
[35:36] prophet they had they had a sacrifice uh
[35:40] sacrificial
[35:41] lamb they had
[35:46] Redemption they had been uh brought
[35:49] through the Red
[35:51] Sea they had been healed of their
[35:55] diseases
[35:57] and they had had water from a smitten
[36:02] Rock they had they had Mana Out of
[36:06] Heaven everything they had need of had
[36:09] been
[36:12] supplied and still they wanted something
[36:18] else now that's a perfect type of our
[36:22] Ephesians today
[36:25] exactly we come out of under
[36:28] Luther we went through
[36:31] sanctification under
[36:35] methodists and came into the restoration
[36:37] under
[36:40] Pentecost exactly like it was the
[36:43] Wilderness
[36:45] journey and when God brought us out we
[36:47] did very
[36:50] well but what did we do we wanted to be
[36:53] like the rest of
[36:55] them
[36:57] now we find out that Grace is the only
[37:01] thing that takes us through never
[37:06] law and now being that all of us know by
[37:13] now that the people could not enter into
[37:16] that Promised
[37:18] Land uh through
[37:22] law and only you can only enter in
[37:24] through Grace
[37:27] now our promised
[37:29] land is the Holy
[37:41] Ghost now here in Exodus
[37:44] 19 in the scripture that we had
[37:48] read here the God is telling
[37:54] them God wants them to be a a
[37:58] priesthood a
[38:00] kingdom of a
[38:03] priesthood so then there's two
[38:06] things United in
[38:08] one that they would be Kings and
[38:15] Priests but because they wanted the law
[38:17] instead of the
[38:19] grace God stood in both
[38:22] things and if you see throughout the
[38:25] Bible
[38:27] one tribe was the tribe of uh the
[38:32] priests and the other tribe was the
[38:34] tribe of
[38:36] Kings but God's original
[38:40] desire was that he wanted both of those
[38:44] offices to be in one
[38:47] people for all of them to be
[38:50] United and not
[38:52] separated but since they had chosen
[38:55] law and not
[38:57] Grace they could never accomplish
[39:00] something like
[39:01] that but since we are under
[39:05] grace in First Peter uh
[39:10] 2:9 but ye are a chosen
[39:14] generation a royal
[39:18] priesthood under
[39:22] grace you can be both Royal and
[39:25] priesthood if you stay under the
[39:29] law you will never accomplish to be a
[39:31] royal
[39:32] priesthood and just like Jesus
[39:35] Christ is the king of
[39:37] kings and is also the high
[39:41] priest he is one single
[39:44] person but he has multiple
[39:48] offices he has both
[39:54] offices now we're going to take the
[39:56] subject of
[39:58] Esther in Esther
[40:10] 25 now in the place there was a certain
[40:13] Jew whose name was uh
[40:17] Mori uh the son of Jer uh the son of
[40:20] shimi and the son of Kish a
[40:25] benjamite
[40:35] who had been carried away from Jerusalem
[40:37] with the Captivity which had been
[40:39] carried away with uh Janiah the king of
[40:41] Judah and whom Nebuchadnezzar the king
[40:43] of Babylon had carried
[40:55] away
[41:00] and he brought up hadasa that is Esther
[41:03] his uncle's daughter for she had neither
[41:05] father nor mother and the maid was fair
[41:07] and beautiful whom morai when her father
[41:10] and mother were dead took for his own
[41:14] daughter now one thing that brother
[41:16] Brandon teaches
[41:18] us is that person should always find
[41:21] Jesus
[41:23] Christ in every verse of the Bible
[41:28] so he also teaches us that the
[41:31] scriptures have a double meaning or
[41:33] multiple
[41:36] meanings now here when he talks about
[41:40] Esther from what we can read we tells us
[41:43] that she was an
[41:46] orphan she didn't have a father or a
[41:52] mother and we're talking about that uh
[41:54] subject of Kings and Priests
[41:59] and when we search out through the
[42:02] Bible we find out that there is a king
[42:05] and a
[42:06] priest that is one single
[42:09] person who did not have also a father or
[42:12] a
[42:13] mother and his name was
[42:15] MDC in Hebrews
[42:25] 7
[42:27] Hebrews 713 for this mzc the king of
[42:30] Salem priest of the most high God who
[42:32] met Abraham returning from the slaughter
[42:34] of the Kings and blessed
[42:44] him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth
[42:47] part of all first being by
[42:49] interpretation of king of righteousness
[42:52] and after that also the king of Salem
[42:54] which is king of peace
[42:59] without father without
[43:02] mother just like Esther
[43:05] was Esther in the natural she was an
[43:09] orphan because she did not have a father
[43:12] or a
[43:13] mother but now if you apply it into the
[43:17] spiritual you can see that she is
[43:20] something like
[43:24] MDC because later on in her life she
[43:26] became being a
[43:28] queen and a
[43:31] priest to intercede for her
[43:36] people so that scripture is not only
[43:38] talking about an orphan
[43:41] child it also speaks about how she is
[43:44] something like
[43:46] MDC a priest and a
[43:49] king both
[43:50] offices in a single
[43:54] person nothing separated
[43:58] but both things united into
[44:00] one in one single
[44:06] person now we're going to be reading a
[44:08] lot of scriptures
[44:10] tonight and it reads here in Revelations
[44:14] 15 now it speaks about Jesus
[44:25] Christ
[44:29] and from Jesus Christ who is a faithful
[44:30] witness and the first begotten of the
[44:32] dead and the prince of the kings of the
[44:34] earth unto him that loved us and washed
[44:37] us from our sins in his own
[44:43] blood and hath made us Kings and Priests
[44:46] unto God and his
[44:50] father now I want you to pay close
[44:52] attention that he made us Kings and
[44:54] Priests unto God and his
[45:05] father now we're going to read something
[45:07] that brother brandham
[45:11] says and the message Hebrews chapter 7
[45:14] number
[45:18] two and he said and this mzc was not
[45:21] Jesus for he was
[45:24] God
[45:26] and what made Jesus and God
[45:31] different was that Jesus was the
[45:33] tabernacle that God dwelt
[45:38] in see now MDC Jesus had both father and
[45:46] mother and this man never had father or
[45:51] mother Jesus had a beginning of Life and
[45:54] he had an end of life
[45:59] and this man had no father nor mother no
[46:02] beginning of days or ending of
[46:06] life but it was the uh was the self same
[46:11] person so now here brother Bram is
[46:13] telling
[46:15] us that both of these uh
[46:19] people or it appears to be two
[46:22] people MDC and Jesus he says that
[46:26] they're
[46:28] different but then he says that they're
[46:30] the same
[46:32] person and he continues to say like
[46:38] this uh mzc and Jesus was
[46:42] one but Jesus was the Earthly
[46:46] body born and fashioned after
[46:49] sin God's own
[46:54] body his own son born and fashioned
[46:57] after sin to take the thing out of the
[47:01] death to pay the
[47:05] ransom and to receive Sons and Daughters
[47:08] unto
[47:12] himself now the reason being that
[47:14] they're two different
[47:16] people and although they're the same
[47:21] person is because one per one of them is
[47:24] made of three different things
[47:28] a human being is both Body Spirit and
[47:32] soul so then the body of Jesus was not
[47:37] God but what was inside of Jesus it was
[47:42] God that's the reason why it was two
[47:44] different
[47:46] people but even then they're the same
[47:49] person and brother Bram
[47:53] says in Hebrews chapter 7 part part
[47:58] one now we want to notice here now
[48:03] again as we go on with this lesson of uh
[48:06] this
[48:10] MDC this great priest of Salem and the
[48:13] uh and the possessor of Heaven and the
[48:19] earth now being first without father
[48:21] without
[48:22] mother without
[48:24] descent
[48:26] having neither beginning of days nor
[48:28] ending of
[48:31] life but was made like unto the Son of
[48:35] God abideth a priest
[48:41] continually now watch he wasn't the Son
[48:43] of
[48:45] God he was the god of the
[48:50] son he wasn't the Son of God mzc
[48:54] wasn't
[48:57] but he was the father of the Son of
[49:01] God but Jesus Christ himself
[49:05] says my father and I are
[49:09] one so what seems to be two different
[49:13] people there are just two different
[49:16] attributes that are within a single
[49:20] person and it reads in John
[49:24] 5
[49:27] and verse 18 therefore the Jews sought
[49:30] the more to kill
[49:33] him because he not only broke the
[49:39] Sabbath but said also that God was his
[49:43] father uh What uh horrible
[49:48] saying was to say that God was his
[49:51] father but then the scriptures continue
[49:53] to
[49:54] say
[49:56] that God was his own
[49:59] father being co equal to
[50:06] God so by Jesus saying that God was his
[50:11] father he was basically saying that he
[50:13] was God
[50:18] himself and that's the very same thing
[50:20] that happens to you when you say or
[50:23] confess that you're a Christian
[50:25] when you are born
[50:27] again you are now a child of
[50:31] God you then confess that you have the
[50:33] Holy
[50:34] Spirit and God is your
[50:37] father and now God dwells in
[50:41] you just the same as uh God dwell in
[50:45] Jesus that's the reason why you and God
[50:47] are
[50:49] one because God lives in
[50:52] you it's two different people
[50:56] in one single
[51:00] person and the scripture says in John 17
[51:12] 21 that they all may be one as thou
[51:15] father are in me and I in thee and that
[51:18] they also may be one in
[51:21] us and in verse
[51:24] 22
[51:30] and the glory which thou gavest me I
[51:32] have given them that they may go ahead
[51:35] that they may be one even as we are
[51:43] one i in them and thou and me that they
[51:46] may be made perfect in
[51:52] one so then you come have to come to the
[51:54] realization that that when you become a
[51:56] child of
[51:57] God you then now become a
[52:02] God just the same as brother Luis told
[52:04] us on
[52:06] Sunday God was the god of the
[52:09] universe but Adam was the god of the
[52:13] earth and he says that when Jesus Christ
[52:17] returns we shall reign the Earth with
[52:22] him but you first have to learn Reign
[52:25] over your
[52:27] body because your body was made out of
[52:30] the
[52:31] earth you are a Dei God or a small
[52:35] God because you are a child of
[52:39] God because you are now one with
[52:44] God that is something that the devil has
[52:47] always
[52:48] desired to be like
[52:54] God and and it says here in
[52:57] uh Isaiah
[52:59] yeah and Isaiah
[53:02] 14 verse
[53:11] 12 how art thou fallen from Heaven oh
[53:13] Lucifer son of the morning how art thou
[53:16] cut down to the ground which did is
[53:18] weaken the
[53:24] Nations
[53:30] for thou Hast said in thine heart I will
[53:32] Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[53:34] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[53:36] upon the mountain of the congregation in
[53:38] the sides of the
[53:43] north I will Ascend above the heights of
[53:46] the clouds I will be like the most
[53:49] high that was the devil's
[53:51] desire to be like God
[53:56] but he was never able to accomplish
[53:59] it but the Bible
[54:02] says that when God created
[54:06] Adam he made it like unto His
[54:10] Image so then what you be end up
[54:13] becoming in your spiritual
[54:15] life you end up becoming like
[54:20] God something that the devil exactly
[54:22] wanted to
[54:23] be but he was was never able to
[54:25] accomplish
[54:32] it and brother Bram says in the message
[54:35] questions and answers on Hebrews number
[54:40] three God told Abraham look up to the
[54:43] heavens and Number the Stars if you
[54:45] can and he said I can't do
[54:52] it he said neither will you be able to
[54:54] number remember the your
[54:58] seed the stars who is the bright and
[55:00] Morning Star Jesus of
[55:05] Nazareth the brightest that ever lived
[55:07] in human
[55:12] flesh he is the bright and Morning
[55:15] Star and he is the Seed of
[55:18] Abraham coming through
[55:21] Isaac and we being dead in Christ
[55:27] take on Abraham's seat and our erors
[55:29] according to the
[55:31] promise so the stars of the
[55:34] heaven represented the spirits of man
[55:40] here and then if you remember when the
[55:42] devil began his
[55:44] lies it was with the stars of the
[55:47] heaven but now the stars of the
[55:52] heaven are spirits that are now here on
[55:54] Earth
[55:57] and brother bam has always told
[56:00] us what the devil tried to do up there
[56:03] in
[56:05] heaven when he was cast out of heaven
[56:08] and he came down into
[56:11] Earth he continues to try to do the same
[56:16] thing the devil up there in heaven he
[56:19] tried to create his own
[56:23] kingdom
[56:25] and when he was cast down on Earth he
[56:27] tried to create his own kingdom as
[56:30] well but he does it through through the
[56:33] realm of the
[56:36] spirits I in previous
[56:41] years when I had begun this journey at
[56:44] the age of around
[56:46] 18 I began to
[56:50] interpret it was something a bit strange
[56:52] for
[56:53] me
[56:56] I would study every single word that I
[56:58] would
[56:59] hear you may think you know
[57:03] English and you might think that you
[57:05] know
[57:06] Spanish but when it's time for you to
[57:09] interpret you find out that you don't
[57:11] know
[57:15] nothing and one of my greatest fears if
[57:17] I could say it this way
[57:21] is I grew a fear that I didn't know how
[57:25] to uh correctly interpret a
[57:30] word so then I would go home and study
[57:32] every single word that I would
[57:34] hear I would hear the tapes of brother
[57:38] brandham even though that I didn't
[57:40] understand a single thing that he
[57:43] said I would pay more attention to the
[57:45] words that he would
[57:46] use when I would read the
[57:50] Bible I would read every single
[57:53] word and I would try to understand
[57:54] understand
[57:57] it even though I didn't understand what
[57:59] the reason why it was written in that
[58:03] manner so one of the tapes that I
[58:05] started hearing about about brother
[58:07] brandham years
[58:10] ago was de
[58:15] demonology and you know that brother
[58:17] Bram divides that into two
[58:21] sections now in English he uses a very
[58:24] specific word
[58:26] realm which is the word
[58:30] realm but when the
[58:33] interpreters translated it into
[58:37] Spanish they used another word that was
[58:39] very
[58:40] similar which is
[58:44] kingdom and within myself I had a a
[58:50] conflict remember I said you think you
[58:52] know your own language
[58:55] but when it comes time for you to
[58:57] interpret youve come to realize that you
[58:59] don't know
[59:01] nothing and me and my young
[59:06] mind I thought that I knew what that
[59:09] word
[59:11] meant and I said to myself well the
[59:14] interpreters really messed up
[59:16] here and in reality they never
[59:19] did the one that was wrong was
[59:22] me uh because of that word
[59:27] realm the translation to that is uh
[59:33] sphere
[59:35] but but in studying that single
[59:40] word I found out that that word means
[59:42] two
[59:43] things a
[59:45] kingdom and a
[59:51] dimension so then when brother Bron was
[59:53] talking about demonology
[59:57] and he talks about how the devil also
[59:59] wanted to create his own
[1:00:01] kingdom he does it throughout the
[1:00:06] sphere of the
[1:00:10] dimensions that's how he's able to
[1:00:12] create his own
[1:00:15] kingdom the devil can make his own
[1:00:19] kingdom through a
[1:00:23] dimension
[1:00:25] that's why the Curiosity really grew in
[1:00:26] being to learn what the word realm
[1:00:31] meant now we might not be able to see
[1:00:36] spirits but we can see the effect or the
[1:00:38] actual impact of what they
[1:00:41] cause and we always
[1:00:46] know that the world is controlled by
[1:00:49] either one or the
[1:00:51] other the spirit of God or the the
[1:00:54] spirit of the
[1:00:59] devil but both equally are trying to
[1:01:01] edify their
[1:01:03] Kingdom but it's throughout the
[1:01:08] dimensions because the spirit of God is
[1:01:10] also an invisible
[1:01:12] spirit that works throughout the
[1:01:18] dimensions but we also are trying to
[1:01:20] edify the kingdom of
[1:01:22] God but it's throughout
[1:01:27] Spirits now remember brother brandham
[1:01:30] said that the stars of the
[1:01:35] heaven represent the spirits of the
[1:01:37] mankind here on
[1:01:39] Earth that's the reason why he says in
[1:01:42] job
[1:01:48] 384 where was thou when I laid the
[1:01:50] foundations of the earth declare if thou
[1:01:53] Hast understanding
[1:01:58] when the morning Stars sang together and
[1:02:00] all the sons of God shouted for
[1:02:05] joy and notice what brother bam says
[1:02:07] here in the message the beginning and
[1:02:09] ending of the Gentile
[1:02:13] dispensation and the great high priest
[1:02:15] mzc will come
[1:02:18] someday and will EAD
[1:02:21] communion a new with him in the kingdom
[1:02:24] of God
[1:02:27] one of those great Glorious
[1:02:30] Days oh I'm so happy
[1:02:34] tonight to be in his kingdom yes
[1:02:39] sir some great day some marvelous
[1:02:42] day time shall be no
[1:02:46] more see we come out of
[1:02:51] Eternity we was before there was a world
[1:02:55] did you know
[1:02:58] that God ma God made man in his own
[1:03:02] image where was you he said to
[1:03:07] Job when job thought that he had some
[1:03:12] wisdom said where was you when I laid
[1:03:14] the foundation of the
[1:03:15] world before I laid
[1:03:19] it when the sons of
[1:03:23] God sang together and the morning Stars
[1:03:26] shouted for
[1:03:28] Joy the morning Stars shouted for
[1:03:31] Joy now he's talking about stars
[1:03:34] here but the stars represent
[1:03:37] spirits of men here on
[1:03:41] Earth them shining ones out shouted for
[1:03:48] Joy when they seen that someday they
[1:03:50] were uh
[1:03:52] tabernacled here on Earth
[1:03:56] and the king
[1:03:58] mzc would come in the righteousness of
[1:04:01] God and give his
[1:04:04] life to redeem us to God again back
[1:04:11] again and outshine the Stars forever and
[1:04:16] ever now what had begun over there in
[1:04:18] heaven is now being portrayed here on
[1:04:23] Earth
[1:04:25] through both
[1:04:27] sides they're both trying to edify their
[1:04:29] own
[1:04:30] kingdom through the
[1:04:33] Spheres through the
[1:04:35] dimensions and Their
[1:04:39] Kingdoms brother brandham
[1:04:43] says United under one
[1:04:46] head see the same
[1:04:51] devil if he can get you to stop just for
[1:04:54] a minute and he can make you reason it
[1:04:57] out he can make you think in your
[1:05:01] mind but God doesn't use a man's
[1:05:04] head God uses his
[1:05:08] heart God works on his heart oh um
[1:05:14] sorry when you get to be one with
[1:05:17] God God comes to your heart he doesn't
[1:05:21] come to your
[1:05:22] mind he comes to your heart
[1:05:27] that's why he says that God uses his
[1:05:33] heart God works in his heart while the
[1:05:35] devil Works in his
[1:05:37] head because both
[1:05:40] sides they're both trying to edify their
[1:05:42] own
[1:05:44] kingdom through the
[1:05:47] spirits that move throughout the
[1:05:53] Spheres
[1:05:55] says here God chose the
[1:05:59] heart because the scripture says for
[1:06:02] though uh for God said his heart as a
[1:06:04] man thinketh in his heart so is
[1:06:08] he now brother BR
[1:06:11] says that God uses the
[1:06:13] heart but the devil uses the
[1:06:17] mind and in 2 Corinthians uh
[1:06:23] 103
[1:06:26] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[1:06:27] not war after the
[1:06:31] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:06:34] not
[1:06:37] carnal But Mighty through God to pull uh
[1:06:40] to the pulling down of
[1:06:46] strongholds casting down imaginations
[1:06:49] and every High thing that exalted itself
[1:06:51] against the knowledge of
[1:06:53] God
[1:06:56] and bringing into captivity every
[1:06:58] thought to The Obedience of
[1:07:01] Christ so our war
[1:07:05] today as it says it's not something
[1:07:08] carnal it's not something
[1:07:11] natural but it's a something that
[1:07:13] happens within your own
[1:07:17] mind and what the Bible tells us that we
[1:07:19] must
[1:07:21] do is that you must take that thought
[1:07:26] and bring it into The Obedience of
[1:07:29] Christ and Christ is his own
[1:07:32] word that's why in previous
[1:07:37] years when we spoke about uh the
[1:07:42] complexes we spoke about how it's
[1:07:44] something that happens first in your
[1:07:47] mind it's a spirit that comes into your
[1:07:51] mind and if you allow that Spirit to
[1:07:53] maintain it itself in
[1:07:56] there you're going to begin to edify a
[1:07:59] kingdom where you are the
[1:08:02] king and you will do whatever you
[1:08:06] want and you will live according to that
[1:08:10] complex when in reality what you should
[1:08:12] be living your life
[1:08:15] as is through the holy spirit that lives
[1:08:18] in
[1:08:19] you but the
[1:08:21] spirits they want to build a complex
[1:08:24] within your
[1:08:26] mind but God wants to use your
[1:08:29] spirit that's within your
[1:08:32] heart so that you may edify a
[1:08:35] kingdom not of
[1:08:37] complexes not of
[1:08:39] unbelief not of
[1:08:42] Doubt but you as a child of
[1:08:44] God be one of one with
[1:08:47] God being just like
[1:08:50] God you are also a
[1:08:52] creator
[1:08:55] just as God created worlds into
[1:08:58] existence you through
[1:09:00] faith can create your own
[1:09:03] world and live in your own world of
[1:09:18] faith brother bam says in the message
[1:09:20] the exposition of the seven Church ages
[1:09:22] the revelation of Jesus
[1:09:25] Christ he hath made
[1:09:28] us oh there are certain truths that we
[1:09:31] need to
[1:09:32] emphasize this is one of
[1:09:34] them he he have made
[1:09:38] us salvation is his
[1:09:42] doing salvation is of the
[1:09:45] Lord all of
[1:09:48] Grace he redeemed us for a
[1:09:51] purpose he bought us for a purpose
[1:09:56] we are Kings spiritual
[1:10:03] Kings oh we are going to be Kings upon
[1:10:06] the earth when him with him when he sits
[1:10:08] on his
[1:10:11] throne but now we are spiritual
[1:10:16] Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual
[1:10:21] Kingdom and there we see the word sphere
[1:10:23] once
[1:10:25] again where it's a
[1:10:28] dimension but a kingdom that's within a
[1:10:31] uh
[1:10:33] Dimension it's a spiritual
[1:10:35] Kingdom and brother Bram continues to
[1:10:40] say right now we reign with
[1:10:44] Christ having dominion over sin the
[1:10:48] World the
[1:10:50] Flesh and the
[1:10:52] devil
[1:10:54] showing forth his praise and
[1:10:57] glory showing forth
[1:11:00] himself for it is Christ in
[1:11:05] US willing and doing of his good
[1:11:10] pleasure yes indeed even now we are
[1:11:16] seated we are seated in Heavenly places
[1:11:19] in Christ
[1:11:21] Jesus okay Bo
[1:11:25] now I'm going to go to Esther
[1:11:33] 2:15 remember I put all of this as a
[1:11:36] foundation to speak now about
[1:11:40] Esther now remember it's not only Esther
[1:11:43] it's
[1:11:46] you Esther by
[1:11:49] birth did not have a father or a
[1:11:52] mother but
[1:11:55] spiritually she was something like
[1:11:59] mzc which was a king and
[1:12:02] priest without beginning of days and
[1:12:05] Without End of
[1:12:08] Days brother Bram says that that
[1:12:10] represents eternal
[1:12:13] life because eternity is without
[1:12:16] beginning or
[1:12:19] end now if you've read the book of
[1:12:22] Esther
[1:12:24] in the first
[1:12:26] chapter the king Had A Feast for seven
[1:12:31] days and in the last day of the
[1:12:36] feast he called his Queen to come before
[1:12:39] him and she didn't want
[1:12:41] to she denied
[1:12:43] him and that's for that very
[1:12:47] reason that the king took her away from
[1:12:50] her
[1:12:51] position so in and then in the next
[1:12:54] couple of
[1:12:57] chapters Begins the search for a new
[1:12:59] king uh
[1:13:02] Queen it's just the same as God is
[1:13:04] looking for a uh a queen or
[1:13:10] bride now if you read in chapter
[1:13:13] two Esther had to go through three
[1:13:17] steps before she could become a
[1:13:21] queen and just the same as each and
[1:13:23] every one of
[1:13:24] us before we can be a child of
[1:13:29] God and becoming a child of God we begin
[1:13:32] to be a spiritual
[1:13:35] priest spiritual
[1:13:40] King we also pass through three
[1:13:43] steps which is
[1:13:45] justification
[1:13:48] sanctification and then the baptism of
[1:13:50] the Holy
[1:13:52] Ghost
[1:13:54] and now when Esther came up to the very
[1:13:55] last step the third
[1:13:58] one in Esther
[1:14:18] 2:15 now when the turn of Esther the
[1:14:21] daughter of uh Abel the uncle of morai
[1:14:24] who had taken her for his daughter was
[1:14:27] come to go into the king she required
[1:14:31] nothing but Hagi the king's Chamberlain
[1:14:34] The Keeper of the women appointed and
[1:14:36] Esther obtained favor in the sight of
[1:14:38] all them that looked upon
[1:14:48] her so Esther was taken unto the king uh
[1:14:51] whoas into his his house Royal in the
[1:14:54] 10th month which is the month of tith in
[1:14:57] the seventh year of his
[1:15:03] Reign and the King loved Esther above
[1:15:06] all the
[1:15:12] women and she obtained grace and favor
[1:15:14] in the sight of more than all the
[1:15:22] virgins V so that he set the Royal Crown
[1:15:25] upon her head and made her Queen instead
[1:15:27] of uh
[1:15:30] vashi so I want you to notice that in
[1:15:32] that third step was the
[1:15:38] crowning and now brother bam says in the
[1:15:40] message of Phil uh Philadelphian uh
[1:15:42] Church
[1:15:44] age what is a
[1:15:46] crown what is a
[1:15:52] crown
[1:15:53] it's a it's a crown which means that you
[1:15:56] have a
[1:16:00] Dominion you are a king if you are
[1:16:04] crowned see and we are the sons of
[1:16:08] God when we're crowned with eternal
[1:16:12] life you when you receive eternal
[1:16:15] life you then become a
[1:16:18] king spiritually
[1:16:22] speaking
[1:16:24] and it says that our Dominion is the
[1:16:28] Earth make you priests and Kings unto
[1:16:31] God
[1:16:36] okay just like we spoke last
[1:16:42] time we spoke about how there was a man
[1:16:44] in that
[1:16:46] Kingdom and his name was uh
[1:16:50] Aman and he represented the devil
[1:16:55] because he wanted the worship of the
[1:16:59] king just the same as the devil wanted
[1:17:01] to be worshiped uh like
[1:17:05] God now this man uh
[1:17:10] amen he hated the Jews so
[1:17:15] much that he began to bring up a
[1:17:20] plan so that all the Jews in the king of
[1:17:23] this man
[1:17:24] king were to be
[1:17:29] killed but he didn't know that his very
[1:17:32] own Queen was a
[1:17:36] Jew so then
[1:17:40] Esther when she found out about this
[1:17:44] news she had to make a
[1:17:47] decision she had not uh told the king
[1:17:51] her true identity
[1:17:56] she never told them that she was a
[1:17:59] Jew so then what the Bible tells
[1:18:03] us now remember we're talking about
[1:18:05] Kings and
[1:18:09] Priests the Bible says that she prayed
[1:18:11] and fasted for three
[1:18:14] days and that's something that I've
[1:18:18] noticed that once you begin to
[1:18:20] consecrate yourself a little more
[1:18:24] the more you can get closer to
[1:18:27] God the more you dedicate time to
[1:18:32] God it's more assured that God will
[1:18:34] respond to
[1:18:37] you and Esther had uh three days
[1:18:42] separated that she prayed and
[1:18:45] fasted and at the end of those
[1:18:48] days the Bible says that she clothed
[1:18:51] herself
[1:18:54] now remember at this point in time she
[1:18:56] is now a queen she had the
[1:19:00] crown in other words she already had
[1:19:02] eternal
[1:19:04] life so then what she
[1:19:07] did she had to go with the
[1:19:10] King to present her
[1:19:18] petition and notice here the Bible tells
[1:19:20] us that by Grace we are saved
[1:19:23] there's nothing that we can do or that
[1:19:26] we've
[1:19:28] done to Merit eternal
[1:19:33] life but the Bible also tells us in that
[1:19:36] very same
[1:19:39] chapter that God has Works prepared for
[1:19:43] us that we have to
[1:19:46] fulfill even though there is no works
[1:19:49] that we can do to be
[1:19:51] saved
[1:19:53] then now when we're all already
[1:19:57] saved there is now things that he wants
[1:20:00] us to do for
[1:20:02] him just the same as the Bible teaches
[1:20:04] us about
[1:20:08] Esther that she found Grace upon the uh
[1:20:11] before the
[1:20:12] king and she was
[1:20:15] crowned in other words she already had
[1:20:17] eternal
[1:20:19] life then when she had already eternal
[1:20:21] life
[1:20:24] she then had a work to
[1:20:26] do as a a
[1:20:29] priest to intercede for her
[1:20:32] people so that they may be
[1:20:37] saved we will never deserve uh
[1:20:41] Salvation but we receive God's
[1:20:43] salvation and eternal
[1:20:47] life but then there comes a point in
[1:20:49] your
[1:20:50] life that you must do something for
[1:20:53] God in favor of someone
[1:20:59] else and do you remember the story about
[1:21:01] sister Hatty
[1:21:04] right and it's something that I was
[1:21:06] listening to
[1:21:09] today remember what the devil wanted to
[1:21:12] do was to be like
[1:21:15] God to be worship like
[1:21:18] God and brother Bram says that the only
[1:21:21] difference
[1:21:23] between the devil and
[1:21:25] God is that the devil cannot
[1:21:28] create but we as children of
[1:21:31] God we are
[1:21:35] creators we can create our own world of
[1:21:38] faith and live in that world of
[1:21:42] Faith through the spirit that's within
[1:21:44] our
[1:21:46] heart we begin to edify a
[1:21:50] kingdom and then we can live in that
[1:21:52] Kingdom with Jesus
[1:21:54] Christ but the
[1:21:57] devil will always want to pervert that
[1:22:00] which you have
[1:22:02] created if you have created a world of
[1:22:06] Faith the devil will always try to
[1:22:09] pervert that
[1:22:11] faith and try to create it into
[1:22:18] unbelief right now sister had
[1:22:21] right
[1:22:25] I think for the most part all of us know
[1:22:27] the
[1:22:29] story but it really caught my attention
[1:22:32] the way that brother bandam started to
[1:22:33] narate
[1:22:35] it he said that she had a
[1:22:41] sister she had a sister that was bed
[1:22:43] written for many
[1:22:48] years brother bam says that they would
[1:22:49] always pray for
[1:22:51] her and she could never come to a full
[1:22:59] healing and he also tells us that uh
[1:23:02] sister had Wright was a very poor
[1:23:04] woman and she was a
[1:23:09] widow she used to work a lot to be able
[1:23:11] to uh feed her
[1:23:14] children and even then at that
[1:23:19] time they were in in Works in to remodel
[1:23:23] the the the
[1:23:26] church and he says that she donated
[1:23:31] $50 and in that time $50 was a
[1:23:36] lot so from the uh depths of the hearts
[1:23:39] of the
[1:23:42] brothers they wanted to return that
[1:23:44] money to Sister
[1:23:48] Hattie because she was struggling to be
[1:23:50] able to feed her children and to be able
[1:23:52] to
[1:23:54] live but then God reminded brother
[1:23:59] brandham of that uh poor old lady in the
[1:24:04] Bible that she gave all of her money
[1:24:07] even though it was very
[1:24:09] little but she gave everything that she
[1:24:13] had and she compared or he compared it
[1:24:15] to sister had
[1:24:19] right and brother brandham had uh the
[1:24:22] the thought of returning at least a
[1:24:23] portion of that
[1:24:25] money but God did not permit
[1:24:28] him because he had something greater for
[1:24:33] her Remember by Grace you are
[1:24:38] saved you can never do anything to
[1:24:41] inherit eternal
[1:24:43] life but then when then now when you are
[1:24:47] saved God is expecting you to do certain
[1:24:51] things for his
[1:24:56] kingdom and the Bible tells
[1:24:59] us and if I had
[1:25:02] time I would take the scriptures to show
[1:25:05] you I have them written down here but I
[1:25:08] don't have enough
[1:25:10] time the Bible tells us that when you
[1:25:13] approach night to
[1:25:15] God and you approach his
[1:25:19] throne the Bible tells us that you're
[1:25:21] supposed to approach it with
[1:25:26] faith you're supposed to approach him
[1:25:28] knowing that he is God is the key isth
[1:25:35] faith and
[1:25:37] mzc is the king of
[1:25:42] righteousness and the Bible tells us
[1:25:44] that we are uh righteous righteous
[1:25:47] through
[1:25:51] faith
[1:25:52] now the same thing as
[1:25:55] Esther by Grace she was elected to be
[1:26:00] Queen she was given a
[1:26:02] crown that represents eternal
[1:26:06] life so then she was now in the Kingdom
[1:26:09] of that
[1:26:11] King she was then now like a priest and
[1:26:15] King her having eternal
[1:26:19] life she then now had to do something
[1:26:21] for her
[1:26:23] people and just the same way that sister
[1:26:26] had
[1:26:26] Wright a
[1:26:29] Christian saved by
[1:26:32] grace she did something in favor for her
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:42] children and it's such a powerful thing
[1:26:44] that brother brandham
[1:26:48] says that when brother bam starts
[1:26:50] speaking about the squirrels
[1:26:54] sister had
[1:26:55] wght she spoke the right
[1:26:59] thing because when you approach
[1:27:02] God you must approach him with
[1:27:07] faith and she said that is nothing but
[1:27:09] the truth brother
[1:27:13] brandham and so then when Esther
[1:27:15] approached the Throne of the god with
[1:27:19] faith she found Grace with that
[1:27:23] King and that King told
[1:27:26] her ask whatever you
[1:27:28] will I'll give you whatever you
[1:27:31] will even up to the half of my
[1:27:35] kingdom and when brother Brandon speaks
[1:27:37] about sister had
[1:27:40] rght he says that God was so pleased
[1:27:43] with what she had
[1:27:45] said he told Brother
[1:27:50] brandom tell her that she has found
[1:27:52] found grace before
[1:27:55] God so that she may ask whatever she
[1:27:58] will and I will grant it to
[1:28:01] her so then Esther approaching unto the
[1:28:06] king that is something that you must do
[1:28:09] Also
[1:28:10] spiritually when you approach
[1:28:13] God you approach unto him with
[1:28:17] faith and as you're coming unto him with
[1:28:21] faith
[1:28:23] he then
[1:28:25] responds you as a a child of
[1:28:28] God you are then a small
[1:28:31] God you are now two
[1:28:35] omnipotents that are approaching one
[1:28:37] with the
[1:28:39] other and brother Bram says that when
[1:28:41] two omnipotent people
[1:28:44] approach then all things are possible in
[1:28:47] that
[1:28:48] moment so then when Esther was
[1:28:50] approaching to the king
[1:28:54] her being a woman of eternal
[1:28:57] life the king then sees
[1:29:00] her and sees
[1:29:03] himself because he is then
[1:29:05] Eternal he is the
[1:29:07] savior and when God sees you approaching
[1:29:11] unto him he sees
[1:29:16] himself he sees the work of Salvation
[1:29:18] that he's done in
[1:29:20] him and he sees that he will have
[1:29:23] eternal
[1:29:26] life you are just a reflection of
[1:29:30] God because you and God are
[1:29:33] one even though there's
[1:29:35] two you are both
[1:29:40] one that's the reason why the Bible
[1:29:42] speaks of eser in that
[1:29:46] manner the Bible says that she
[1:29:48] approached unto
[1:29:50] him and now there is a law that
[1:29:59] exists whosoever enters into that
[1:30:02] place without being called they shall be
[1:30:07] killed now we're talking about the law
[1:30:09] and the
[1:30:11] grace uh under
[1:30:13] law in the Old
[1:30:16] Testament whoever uh whichever
[1:30:19] person that entered into the
[1:30:22] tabernacle into the
[1:30:24] throne would fall
[1:30:29] dead what was it that helped
[1:30:32] Esther to not come out
[1:30:35] dead it was the
[1:30:38] love that the king had towards
[1:30:42] Esther the love that he expressed
[1:30:44] towards
[1:30:47] her through an instrument that was
[1:30:49] called uh Selter the scepter
[1:30:56] sorry and in Hebrews
[1:31:00] 81 oh 18
[1:31:10] sorry but unto the son he saith thy
[1:31:13] Throne oh God is forever and ever and
[1:31:16] the scepter of righteousness is the
[1:31:18] scepter of thy
[1:31:20] kingdom represent
[1:31:23] and that scepter represented the kingdom
[1:31:25] of
[1:31:28] God that scepter represented the
[1:31:30] righteousness of
[1:31:34] God one of the things that I see that
[1:31:36] the Bible speaks about
[1:31:38] righteousness is that it's
[1:31:44] justification when brother Bram teaches
[1:31:46] us about uh uh
[1:31:50] justification he tells us that when a
[1:31:52] person is
[1:31:55] Justified he is first
[1:31:58] forgiven of all of the past
[1:32:05] sins and then he also adds on that it's
[1:32:08] like that person never committed a sin
[1:32:10] to begin
[1:32:13] with and so then when a person would
[1:32:15] approach the
[1:32:17] Tabernacle they would approach the
[1:32:20] throne they would be
[1:32:23] killed because they were born in a
[1:32:25] sinful
[1:32:28] manner but then when you are now born
[1:32:31] again you are then
[1:32:35] Justified and it's like you've never
[1:32:37] sinned in the first
[1:32:39] place but nonetheless now you are
[1:32:43] clean you now can enter into the
[1:32:47] throne and so then when Esther
[1:32:49] approached into the
[1:32:50] throne
[1:32:53] that's the moment when you were
[1:32:54] Justified of your
[1:32:56] sins since you are now clean of your
[1:33:00] sins you then now have permission to go
[1:33:03] or the right to go into that
[1:33:07] throne and that's the reason why we're
[1:33:09] Kings and
[1:33:12] Priests because we reign with
[1:33:15] Christ but in a
[1:33:18] dimension but we are also
[1:33:20] priests
[1:33:22] who can intercede for other
[1:33:26] people just as Esther did it for her
[1:33:30] people and her sister Hatty Wright did
[1:33:32] it for her
[1:33:38] children if you wouldn't mind standing
[1:33:40] with me as I read the final
[1:33:44] thing in Hebrews
[1:33:50] 4:14
[1:33:58] seeing then that we have a high a great
[1:34:00] high priest that is passed into the
[1:34:13] heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold
[1:34:16] fast for our profession for we have not
[1:34:18] an high priest which cannot be touched
[1:34:20] with the field of our
[1:34:22] infirmities but was in all points
[1:34:25] tempted like as we are yet without
[1:34:37] sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto
[1:34:40] the throne of grace that we may obtain
[1:34:42] mercy and find Grace to help in time of
[1:34:46] need let us bow our
[1:34:50] heads
[1:34:52] Heavenly
[1:34:53] Father we want to thank
[1:34:56] you for this little lesson of your
[1:35:01] word and to be able to see how different
[1:35:04] we are from
[1:35:06] you but in the same manner we are one
[1:35:09] with
[1:35:11] you and confessing that we are children
[1:35:14] of
[1:35:15] God and that God is our
[1:35:20] father
[1:35:22] that then means that that person and God
[1:35:24] are
[1:35:27] one help each and every
[1:35:30] person for each and every one of them
[1:35:32] are
[1:35:35] priests that in one point in their life
[1:35:38] they will approach a
[1:35:41] person that will need their
[1:35:46] help they will need them to guide them
[1:35:48] un
[1:35:50] salvation even though though that we are
[1:35:52] not the
[1:35:53] Savior we can help them
[1:35:56] Lord to be able to lead them under the
[1:36:00] Salvation just as Esther did with her
[1:36:04] people and sister had did with her
[1:36:08] children we ask that you help each and
[1:36:10] every person
[1:36:11] Lord that they may be able to meditate
[1:36:14] on these
[1:36:17] words so that they may understand what
[1:36:19] they must do in the kingdom of God
[1:36:22] being a a king and a
[1:36:25] priest we ask all of this
[1:36:28] Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:31] Christ amen
[1:36:33] amen may the Lord bless
[1:36:36] [Applause]
[1:36:42] [Music]
[1:36:48] you praise God
[1:36:54] [Music]
[1:36:55] I feel the
[1:37:00] touch of hand so kind and
