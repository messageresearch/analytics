sixth in our last message of the series and we're going to give her the subtitle as the marriage covenant marriage is honorable and all and the bad undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge androso amen just as we are let's let's bow our heads and let's close our eyes and let's come to the author of the word the lord heavenly father we give you thanks lord for your mercy and your grace this message i just know the message but to accept the message father i want to accept every word that the prophet brought i want to get my garment ready lord if i'm lacking something lord i want to get it ready yo look lord prepare our hearts father senor prepare his father prepare our bodies preparing our minds to receive of your word we ask this in the name of jesus christ amen amen you may take your seats it's very nice to see each and every single one of you to see you here in the house of the lord berlos aquila i hope that you haven't gotten tired of me yet especially but this would be the last message of the series and as we said we're going to title it the marriage covenant we thank everyone who has been coming and has been listening to all the young people that's been watching and listening to us holiness and uh we hope that it's a blessing who has been a blessing to every single one of you and here we're we're reaching the climax of our messages we're probably living out a lot of things and things that you probably are thinking in your mind that we've left out but if you have any questions or you have anything in your mind feel free to prefer to talk to us we don't want to leave anything out what the prophet brought no queremos de carnada fuera de los we even though we have a good opinion but if that a good opinion is not aligned with the word opinion i don't want that good opinion i want what the word of god says the word of god might hurt me it might cut me but i know that it's going to give me life just like if you're in the hospital and you're you're cutting you're bleeding and you got an accident like you've been caught up by life you've been damaged by life but you're there in the hospital the doctor sometimes he's kind of has to poke you just a little bit and get the injection in just to make you feel better so the so the cells can start working but but my soul me alma that's what matters is look important it's my soul it's me alma amen amen i hope you love me and if you love the lord eventually you'll love me when it is amen so so here we want we were speaking about courtship and marriage accustomed and we want everyone and we want the young people to have a successful marriage and we're responsible for that everything what the prophet brought toda we are obligated obligatory to preach what he brought the predicate i'm going to say that again whatever what the prophet brought william mary and branham william marion brown every single tape that he preached as ministers i want you i hope that you can understand that we're not saying this to kill anyone but as ministers are obligated to preach to to the bribery we're responsible to preach what what the prophet amen amen and we we want to speak on the covenant today the definition of the covenant it's a formal or serious agreement or promise something that you heard throughout the scriptures abraham god made a covenant with abraham amen now marriage belongs to the house of god it doesn't belong to the courthouse now if you get get married to the court that's something that we need to do but you have to get married in the house of god if i'm not sure if the brothers in the back they still have that pyramid i i wonder if they can please put that up for me whenever they have a chance [Music] something that we've already spoke of all of these subjects the first one is friendship superficial and then there's a form of friendship superficial formal we talked about courtship when they're dating and then the third one it's confession the fourth one the word of promise or the engagement the wedding ceremony there's there there has to be a waiting ceremony where there has to be a couple of guests then we have the wedding supper hello the honeymoon brother bernie has always told us that there should be a honeymoon all of that's what i'm saying it types the spiritual spiritual with christ there is going to be there is a waiting ceremony there is a waiting supper there is a honeymoon brother bernie says you should at least go out for a weekend three days at least then we have what is the bedroom there is where the the the marriage is consummated that's where it's it's finished amen amen so we're going to read all of that back it up with the word and now as we said one of the first times we we were here there's a lot of people that want to flip that pyramid they want to start from the end and end up in the last term but we want we want to have a successful marriage we want to we want we want christ in our marriage we recommend the young people to get to have the new birth we preach it until we get so exhausted there's only a very rare amount of people that actually do it and the holy spirit that's in him that's going to tell him his post of duty the holy spirit inside of her el espiritu and the first few months start to roll and you start noticing that he's not doing his job you don't have to be barking at them look you got to do this you got to do this or vice versa you got a woman you got to do this holy spirit that's already in them that's why we need to be born again foreign are gonna start going away because he knows what he has to do el salvador she knows what he has but if you just get married just because you just are blindly in love with one another one of these days you're going to find yourself with a hard spot better to have the new birth before you get married amen amen but the ram says this is about the bedroom element after what the marriage is to consummate the marriage there then in the next place you enter in the kind of a relationship of this type logon you stand there maybe in the parlor and she's taking her off her veil and you put your arms around her and you tell her you love her and what she's going to be the most darling wife in all the world and how that you love her and how you're going to be loyal to your to your marriage vows and so forth you've done and had your little feast the wedding feast now you've entered in and you tell her in the parlor which is like a living room you set her down in the chair you set her on your lap and you tell her you're you're ready to enter into real fellowship brother ram says excuse me for this rude expression expression but it's not complete yet but you can completely fellowship with this wife as your wife she's never become a complete fellowship until she's abide in relationship a we're going to go to proverbs 18 verse 22. it says whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaining favor of the lord i want to read that again i hope that maybe some of you can find a revelation here a wife she should be so deep hidden in christ in christ but that man has to come into christ in order to find him a man amen i'm going to say that again that young lady should be so hidden in christ that young man the only way he can find her comment the scripture says then he has favor of the lord it is amen let's go to ephesians chapter five it's a scripture that we've all known very well and this is a type of scripture where we hope we can get some revelation out of it usually when when we read the scripture there's always that one brother [Music] he never says amen but as soon as the minister [Music] [Music] says why submit yourselves onto your husbands as on to the lord so when you're there's a single young lady her lord is the lord jesus christ he submitted on to the lord jesus christ now it says submit yourselves on to your husbands for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body yes therefore as the church is subject onto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands and everything husbands knew what the church did the church kicked out jesus christ he kicked him out of his own house and he still gave himself for it how many can say you meant to do that so he says husbands love your wives christ never pointed the finger to the wife yeah you see that you see over there he loved her no la and he gave him so far he said that's how a man should be foreign amen now i'm going to say something here i i believe that with all of my heart if there's a minister usher deacon musician song musical director and if he treats her like a doormat is how what makes you think if you don't even love your wife but if she doesn't even cook for you because she did something wrong you want to start yelling at her but you want to say hey man brothers you ready for service may should i i i hope you can see my heart especially and he says that verse 26 that he may sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word he says that he may present it to himself as a glorious church not having a spot on not even as the lord even as the lord the church como christo for we are members of his body of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined onto his wife and they shall be they they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church paul says this is a great mystery pablo he says but we understand that every mystery has already responsible amen amen you love god's word hey man let's go to genesis 24. mama here's where we left off with with isaac and rebecca rebecca where the servant finished talking to her family and they they took off to go see isaac it says and rebecca arose in her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took rebecca and went his way rebecca is and isaac came from the way of the whale of lahai roy for he dwelt in the south country evening and isaac went out to mediate in the field at the even tide and he lifted up his eyes and he saw and behold the camels were coming rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel for she had for she had said unto the servant what man is that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself and the servant told isaac all the things that he had done entonces let's read what brother branham has to say here this this is where we took where we we ended on friday he says but that's when the bride takes the bridegroom's name yes she's no more than her she's no more than of her own name she takes the bridegroom's name and then when the church has a ceremony makes their promises then she takes the bridegroom's name then she's no longer a church of the del mundo world is a church of the lord jesus christ i don't mean that by name i mean that by birth by nature by the power of god by the review truth truth of god in the heart she becomes a christian church christian the great universal apostolic christian church iglesia christian apostolic universal she becomes a part of christ now christ injects enter into her his own spirit his own life christo spirit and the bible said to adam and eve there you are no longer twain but one. and and when the woman the church is married to christ are no longer two they are one his life has been brought into you then you become the bride another thing after she has taken all these vowels and so forth and the ceremony has been said like my wife's name was broy before she was married now she's no longer broy she's brenham yes branham now she is a no more boy she's branham yeah as brad when she come into christ you're known you're no more of the world you're of christ you care not then to the things of the world they is but that husband has to die we have to be born again and get married to christ now that that husband our flesh is dead so when that husband does nothing no longer has a voice anymore amen here in the wedding ceremony there are some main things or objects that we need you know i know a lot of people they have these traditions brother bernie says when a young lady wants to get married that's her day what she wants to do what she wants to do let's look at it but there are there are certain objects that there needs to be in the wedding who has the most big wedding who is the most flashy one who pay for the most how to do this and that and the other day we should never forget what the actual meaning of it would be ceremony is a type of christ we're witnessing that ceremony one of the things that she needs is her dress because the bride of jesus christ she is getting her dress ready it's usually a white dress that means purity normal blanco significa types the holy spirit then where people wear it to show the people outside that they're married back in the old times they used to have like a a bracelet that was a thing around their head and it had certain diamonds and if they lose on those diamonds they meant they lost virtue but now we have the wedding ring and it means something significant it's usually it's it's a circle circle where it has no beginning and it has no end principle nowadays they have people have what they want white gold or gold but it really truly then we have the veil where where the bride she comes down the aisle usually she comes with her with her father normal because that's her head rather that's the head that's in charge of her yes and the responsibility of that head is that he or that rather that she will find her actual head his responsibility is that she will find her head okay she's in charge of her car when i walk down the aisle she's walking down with her with her veil on about i've been in weddings i think i've heard even brother bernie do it before when the young lady is walking down the aisle let's go to isaiah 22. [Music] and it says i will clothe him with thy robe and strengthen him with my with thy girdle and i will commit thy government unto his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of jerusalem and to the house of judah jerusalem and the key of the house of david will lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open for unto us a in is born unto us is given the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace is he that hath the key of david this beautiful phrase follows come comes out of the preceding phrase he that is true christ the perfect realization contrasted with personal realization here it is moses was a prophet of god but jesus like unto moses was the prophet of god david a man after god's own heart was a king of israel but jesus is the is the greater david king of kings the lord of lords god very good very god israel jesus now david was born out of the tribe of judah out of whom no priest came yet he ate of the shoe bread was reserved for priests de la he was the great warrior overcoming the enemy establishing the people as the king as king he said on the throne he was a prophet el fuel gran guerrero venciondo en amigo establa he was a wonderful type of christ now it says in isaiah 22 22 and the key of the house of david will lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut the spirit used the spirit uses old testament reference concerning the lord jesus christ and his ministry in the church what the key of david signified at the time is a mere shadow which now fulfilled is jesus standing in the midst of the lampstands is it has to do with our lord after his resurrection and not his earthly pilgrimage but what what does this key signify the answer lies in the position of the key in a position it's not in his hand it is not worn around his neck it's not placed in the hands of an of other men or the verse could not be saying that he alone has the use of that king for he alone opens and shuts and no man has the right but jesus himself jesus but the ramp says isn't that right madonna brahms but where is the key it's on his shoulder but what does a shoulder have to do with it read isaiah 9 6. and the government shall be upon his shoulders what is that what does that mean when the bride has been committed and places it on the groom's shoulders signifying that not only is she under her his dominion significa but also that he bears the responsibility responsibility decree exactly who will be in his bride he knew who was going to be in his bride elsa he chose her ella elizio she did not choose him he called her ella she did not come over on her own solar he died for her el morio and he accepts the obligation when god i want no he'll come in once a year to have sacrificed for himself and for the people but then here came the ultimate sacrifice jesus christ he came the birds and the animals were just sad because they they crucify the savior of the world el salvador and the veil was ran into it was ripped how can you come in the presence of god when you don't even love your own husband i hope you still love me right after the young lady comes down the altar with her husband and the face of this company we joined together this man and this woman holy matrimony is therefore not it is therefore not by any to be entered on into this unadvisably or lightly this is something we we spoke about the first message we broke down the definition of the words and now no one should enter unadvisably or lightly ok we're responsible responsibilities we preach for everything there brother and the fear of god in this holy state these two persons present come to be joined is there anyone here that can show a just cause why they should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony the confession i will acquire and i will charge you both as you will surely answer that day of judgment when the secrets of the heart shall be disclosed there's either of you that know any impediment why you should not be lawfully joined together in this holy matrimony unto you that any couples that are joined otherwise then god's worth that allows [Music] but only be duly believing you have considered the son of obligation the promise they have one another is the same as you're joining the right hands together well you have this woman to be your lawful weighted wife to live together in this holy state of matrimony you promised to love and honor and cherish and to support in sickness and health prometheus riches and i will forsake all others as long as you both shall live yeah will you take will you have this man to be your lawful weighted husband to live together in holy state of matrimony you promise to love honor and cherish your support and sickness and health prometheus it says god bless you you're married and he says here whichever guy joins together let no man put asunder before that brother branham was praying and solomon i had the prayer right there but just to save some time i'm not going to read the quote but this is something here that mary should be honored by allah instead of them finding out long it's beautiful the the the courtship the friendship the stage of engagement but we should enter into this wisely knowing that this can ruin our entire life there's there's tapes about this that's what you should pray about and pray about it make sure that you're positive about it [Music] there but if you want to follow me it's in the message questions and answers number three 64. 0 8 30 morning the question was asked the other day it was annoyment see when you see when you ask me those questions friends miss amigos you don't

mother to him is [Applause] i am duty bound to that word and i say you got married by the magistrate you said you've been married but and you should have been married by the church the minister you say the question might be should i come and get married again if you wish to see this yes don't have nothing in your mind that bothers your faith because because if anything's there you can't go any further than right there you stop right there when that question mark there's where you end right there is on the terminus but now for me it will be all right you can please stand it just come forth that baptize me in the name of the lord jesus christ finally run me out of the church these things are coming to me i got boys and friends sitting here amigos men and women that that they will take they'll pull their eye out and give it to me ombre [Music] my own grandson but to say truth or truth it's true i could go out here today and i'll call up some of these assemblies of god or some of these people and tell them i was wrong and i ain't going to stay with the word you know i'm going to stay with you i'd probably be a very popular person with the gift of god to throw all of my influence to one of these organizations i don't [Music] billy paul billy paul or no billy oh no billy paul billy paul billy paul or no billy paul oh no billy paul that's exactly the truth he's married

that will be easier to find this facility maybe one day we can put it on our website as a series and uh we wanted to make sure brother luis had the all the liberty liberty to speak his his mind is and i agree with everything that he said i think it will help our youth in the future even the married couples and uh i have to uh make a decision see the covet has gone down quite a bit and if you look around look at the numbers has gone down quite a bit now we have all kinds of information from everyone different information the government's been pretty good as to give us uh misinformation they'll tell us we need one shot two shots three shots so they've been pretty good at creating a confusion but i think that our mass should be optional and if you want to talk about it we're going to sit down
