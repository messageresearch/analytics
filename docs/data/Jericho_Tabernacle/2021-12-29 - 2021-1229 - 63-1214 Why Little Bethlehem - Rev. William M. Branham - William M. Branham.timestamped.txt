[0:00] foreign
[1:56] nice to be here this morning and now i
[1:57] believe we're going to have a special
[1:59] brother williams is telling me by
[2:00] someone from his church
[2:13] like the woman at the well
[2:17] i was seeking
[2:22] for
[2:23] things that could not satisfy
[2:30] and then
[2:33] i heard my savior
[2:37] speaking
[2:40] draw from my well
[2:44] that never shall run
[2:48] [Music]
[2:51] fill my cup lord
[2:54] [Music]
[2:55] i lift it up lord
[3:00] come and question
[3:04] thirsting
[3:06] of my soul
[3:10] [Music]
[3:24] [Music]
[3:28] fill it up and make
[3:38] [Music]
[3:41] this world gave you
[3:50] that won't pass away
[3:56] my
[3:58] blessed lord
[4:00] will come and save you
[4:06] if you
[4:08] kneel to him
[4:12] and
[4:14] pray
[4:17] [Applause]
[4:18] fill my cup lord
[4:22] [Music]
[4:23] i lift it up lord
[4:28] come and quench
[4:31] this thirsting of my soul
[4:37] bread of heaven
[4:41] [Music]
[4:51] [Music]
[4:55] fill it up and make me
[5:03] [Music]
[5:10] that's what we're here for this morning
[5:13] raising up our cups philip lord yes lord
[5:18] this is the only time that we'll have
[5:19] the opportunity to ask this there'll
[5:22] come a time where we'll be
[5:25] on the other side
[5:27] and then we won't have that opportunity
[5:30] so while we do have it and in our right
[5:33] mind
[5:34] i think one of the most sensible things
[5:36] that anyone can do while god has given
[5:39] us the opportunity to do so
[5:41] is to do it get our cups filled now
[5:44] with his love and mercy
[5:48] there is
[5:49] one who
[5:52] sat with us long ago
[5:54] not too long ago
[5:56] neither
[5:58] and he's passed on
[6:01] and it's a great
[6:03] sorrow in our hearts for brother
[6:06] williams that's brother williams our
[6:08] chapter
[6:09] president here
[6:11] his father
[6:12] how was your father brother 88 88
[6:16] that'd be about
[6:18] 18 years i guess a past the
[6:21] the uh no i've been uh yeah 18 years
[6:23] have passed the promised time
[6:26] a gallup man it hasn't been too long ago
[6:28] since
[6:29] setting in the meeting
[6:31] i said to him in no disregards to
[6:33] brother williams i said
[6:35] you look younger than your son
[6:37] carl
[6:38] it just goes to show that we're here
[6:40] today and tomorrow we're not here
[6:43] we don't know when that time comes
[6:46] when it is coming but we know it's
[6:47] coming
[6:49] i was thinking
[6:51] but life
[6:53] is a great thing it's life is an
[6:54] opportunity
[6:56] we
[6:57] just had a
[6:58] great tragedy of one that come to our
[7:01] church that's along from chicago was
[7:03] killed the other day coming home
[7:05] a mother
[7:07] she's supposed i guess close to 70 and
[7:10] she and her husband riding along and up
[7:12] kansas or missouri won a blizzard going
[7:15] through a
[7:16] man driving car out of control
[7:19] her neck was broke instantly
[7:21] and we just don't know
[7:24] when this is coming
[7:25] when i
[7:26] they called me to tell me about it and i
[7:28] called up all the children around across
[7:30] the nation
[7:31] telling them of course being their
[7:33] pastor like i was one to
[7:35] notify them
[7:37] uh
[7:39] thinking of how quick we can go and then
[7:41] there said a box of candy sitting before
[7:43] me that she made me about a week ago and
[7:45] gave to me
[7:46] just to see how quick we can be snapped
[7:48] out
[7:49] but
[7:50] if that this life only was where we had
[7:53] our hopes we'd be a miserable people
[7:56] job said in the 14th chapter all that
[7:58] thou would hide me in the grave and keep
[8:00] me in a secret place
[8:02] have you ever noticed how nature
[8:04] testifies of god
[8:06] we find the trees the leaves go off the
[8:09] trees
[8:10] and the
[8:11] life in the tree goes down into the
[8:13] ground like the grave
[8:15] and stays there until the wrath of the
[8:17] winter is past then it comes back again
[8:19] bringing forth new life
[8:21] it's a testimony that we live again
[8:24] the sun rises of the morning just a
[8:26] little baby
[8:27] it's weak
[8:29] after a while it's this time it's in
[8:31] school high school
[8:33] then at noon it's in its strength
[8:35] then the afternoon it begins to turn to
[8:38] the other side then in the evening it
[8:39] gets weak again and dies
[8:42] but that's not the end of the sun
[8:44] it comes up again the next morning to
[8:46] testify to another generation
[8:48] that there is a life death burial and
[8:51] resurrection
[8:52] [Applause]
[8:53] even nature everywhere speaks of him
[8:56] and nature
[8:58] is a great testimony in another way that
[9:00] is that we cannot have this resurrection
[9:02] life unless it serves god's purpose
[9:06] now if a seed is planted and that seed
[9:08] is germatized
[9:10] it brings forth a new flower but if it
[9:13] isn't germatized it will not bring forth
[9:15] a new flower if it doesn't serve god's
[9:17] purpose
[9:18] that i just because it's a flower it
[9:20] rises because it serves god's purpose
[9:23] that's the reason the sun rises because
[9:25] it serves god's purpose
[9:27] and we rise when we serve god's purpose
[9:31] i believe that
[9:33] brother williams
[9:34] served god's purpose in life
[9:36] a real father
[9:39] and i see his darling companion mrs
[9:41] williams sitting here
[9:43] a real husband
[9:45] that's one of god's purposes
[9:47] a father
[9:48] one of god's purposes and he was
[9:50] dramatized to god by the holy spirit
[9:54] god's main purpose
[9:56] so to say that brother williams will not
[9:57] rise and be with us again we'd have to
[9:59] say there's no there's no going down to
[10:01] the sap there's no rising of the sun
[10:03] everything speaks of his resurrection
[10:05] again to be with us again
[10:07] everything first the sun the flowers the
[10:10] nature botany life
[10:13] everything speaks of it and then the
[10:14] word of god speaks for him and besides
[10:17] that the very faith that's in our heart
[10:19] pulsates that we'll see him again
[10:21] god rest his soul just as a little
[10:23] salute to him that once sat with us let
[10:25] us stand to her feet just a moment
[10:28] [Applause]
[10:31] heavenly father we have never tried
[10:33] to make a gathering like this a purpose
[10:36] just to be seen or heard
[10:39] we have come together each time for
[10:42] the edification of thy son jesus christ
[10:46] and to give testimony to those who are
[10:48] without him that they might find him
[10:51] we are our hearts are burdened for those
[10:54] who are left behind from the departing
[10:56] of our brother
[10:57] one that sat with us not long ago is
[10:59] many times set right in this same
[11:01] chapter
[11:02] but we believe that you let him live out
[11:04] a good full round life
[11:06] and his soul is with you today
[11:08] rest him o god until that day when we
[11:11] shall see him again
[11:13] bless his son here his other children
[11:15] his darling wife those who love him
[11:18] that's all of us father
[11:20] may we take notice to this that we too
[11:22] are frail
[11:24] and we must go someday so let us prepare
[11:26] ourselves
[11:28] for that great hour and if there should
[11:29] be some here this morning who has not
[11:32] prepared for this same event may this be
[11:35] the day that they'll say yes to the lord
[11:37] jesus and also be dramatized to him by
[11:40] the holy spirit
[11:42] for we ask that in jesus name amen
[11:46] he's seated
[11:50] now we want to announce a few
[11:53] announcements
[11:55] my wife
[11:56] was sitting back there this morning i

[13:31] we're certainly
[13:33] happy to have you with us this morning
[13:34] and we accordingly invite you out to
[13:36] bring your people
[13:38] uh the ones especially that you know
[13:40] you're in the city that doesn't know
[13:41] jesus as their savior
[13:43] and then secondarily to those who are
[13:46] sick and and believes that god answers
[13:48] prayer we
[13:49] aim to pray for the sick during this
[13:51] time
[13:52] just prior to the great national
[13:53] convention is to be held here beginning
[13:55] of 22nd
[13:57] and i'm sure you want to hear that
[13:58] because these many outstanding speakers
[14:00] come and i'm sure you have a great time
[14:04] now this morning i have
[14:08] thought about speaking here to this
[14:10] chapter which phoenix has always been a
[14:12] place on my heart i like phoenix
[14:15] i was sure when i was a little boy
[14:17] out here at wickenburg just above and
[14:19] lived down here at 16th and henshaw it
[14:20] was a desert then
[14:23] but i see it's right in the metropolitan
[14:25] well really in the heart of the city
[14:28] goes to show that there's a changing
[14:30] time changing but there's one thing i
[14:32] want to speak on this morning is the
[14:34] unchanging one that's god
[14:37] god in his program his word it never
[14:39] changes times change man's change
[14:42] systems change but god never changes he
[14:45] ever remains the same
[14:47] i thought being that we were
[14:49] facing the christmas time that we would
[14:51] maybe uh
[14:53] speak on a christmas message
[14:56] and now if you have your bibles and like
[14:58] to read sometimes people do behind uh
[15:02] evangelist or speaker
[15:03] i want to read from saint matthew's
[15:06] gospel the second chapter for a potion
[15:08] of the word
[15:12] now when jesus was born in bethlehem of
[15:14] judea in the days of herod the king
[15:17] behold there came wise men from the east
[15:20] to jerusalem
[15:22] saying where is he that's born king of
[15:24] the jews for we have seen his star in
[15:27] the east and are come to worship him
[15:30] when herod the king heard these things
[15:32] he was troubled in all jerusalem with
[15:34] him
[15:36] and when he had gathered all the chief
[15:38] priests and the scribes of the people
[15:40] together he demanded them where christ
[15:43] should be born
[15:44] they said unto him in bethlehem of judea
[15:48] for thus it is written by the prophets
[15:51] and thou bethlehem of the land of judah
[15:54] are not the least among the princes of
[15:57] judah but out of thee shall come a
[15:59] governor that shall rule my people
[16:03] israel
[16:05] may the lord add his blessings to the
[16:07] reading of his word and now
[16:09] with some notes here and some scriptures
[16:12] referred to i like to have your
[16:15] undivided attention for a little while
[16:18] on the subject of why
[16:21] little bethlehem
[16:23] you know at christmas i think we all
[16:27] too many of us i wouldn't say all but
[16:29] too many of us lose the real value of
[16:31] what christmas is
[16:34] as an artist out here even the palm
[16:36] trees are decorated and
[16:39] in the east it's always the fir tree or
[16:41] the evergreen
[16:42] and months or weeks rather maybe a month
[16:45] or six weeks before christmas ever
[16:47] begins
[16:48] it's always a tinsel and and a great
[16:51] they made it a commercial
[16:53] instead of
[16:55] what it really means
[16:57] i don't believe that christ is born on
[16:59] the 25th day of december
[17:01] i do not believe that at all it would be
[17:04] impossible for the things to happen
[17:06] the hills of judea are sore then
[17:09] while snow is way steep in there in the
[17:11] month of december up in judea
[17:14] but we realize and
[17:17] studying history
[17:18] uh christ was probably born in the
[17:21] spring along maybe april may somewhere
[17:24] like that
[17:25] but when it was changed this
[17:27] brought it when christianity was
[17:28] converted into romanism they made the
[17:31] sun god's birthday which was at the
[17:34] solar
[17:35] at the 25th from the
[17:37] 21st to the 25th of december the sun
[17:40] setting right almost hearty changes at
[17:42] all
[17:43] and then that was the sun god's birthday
[17:45] so they change it to the son of god but
[17:48] remember
[17:49] whatever what day it might be
[17:52] we still doesn't take away the
[17:54] sacredness of what is supposed to be
[17:57] where satan has robbed us of this has
[17:59] made the great commercial in santa claus
[18:01] stole all of the worship
[18:04] it's become a day like easter like uh
[18:07] bunny rabbits and pink ducks and
[18:10] and what's that got to do with easter
[18:12] once i got to the resurrection of christ
[18:15] it's just like the world today
[18:17] the kids on the street can tell you more
[18:19] about davey crockett than he could about
[18:21] jesus christ they can tell you more
[18:22] about some uh
[18:24] outlaw some criminal of days gone by
[18:26] than the can the prince of life that
[18:30] that was born
[18:32] uh 1900 years ago
[18:34] but that doesn't take
[18:36] the real thing away from we christians
[18:39] you see always light shines its best in
[18:43] the darkness
[18:44] the fork and lightning in the black
[18:46] cloudy skies at night shows
[18:49] there can be light and darkness
[18:53] and when the light is shining you don't
[18:54] see if the sun shining you don't need
[18:57] the lights too much
[18:58] but darker
[19:00] the smaller the light greater will shine
[19:03] in the darkness
[19:04] darker the better it shows itself better
[19:06] and that's more or less that we
[19:07] christians ought to be testifying to the
[19:09] glory of god giving his son to us
[19:12] this christmas ought to be an
[19:13] outstanding thing we christians are no
[19:16] matter how much it looks it'll make it
[19:18] shine that much better the whole world's
[19:20] got tinsel we've got christ
[19:25] and that's what we ought to be letting
[19:26] shine in this dark hour that we're now
[19:28] living in
[19:30] we think of how god does things in
[19:32] unusual ways because he is unusual
[19:35] himself
[19:36] god is unusual he's he's the
[19:38] supernatural the infinite until we
[19:41] finite
[19:42] so anything he does is in his scope
[19:45] unusual
[19:46] and
[19:48] god is so
[19:50] so great till he takes the unidentified
[19:52] things of the earth to identify himself
[19:55] by
[19:56] we notice here in my subject of why a
[19:59] little bethlehem
[20:00] that smallest of all of judea the
[20:03] princes of other cities of judea why did
[20:06] god choose to send his son to that place
[20:09] that's what we want to talk on
[20:12] god taking the things of the world i'll
[20:15] be the scripture says by the foolishness
[20:17] of preaching it please
[20:18] god to take the unidentified things what
[20:22] we make great god calls foolish
[20:25] what we put so much glory to god says
[20:27] it's it's it's no good and what we think
[20:30] is no good god glorifies it was thinking
[20:34] of just before the birth of our lord
[20:37] when
[20:38] all the prophets and so forth this spoke
[20:40] of the forerunner coming
[20:42] however a mountain would be brought low
[20:44] and the low places brought high and the
[20:45] mountains of skipped like little rams
[20:47] the leaves that clap their hands
[20:49] it was a
[20:50] a minister
[20:52] a prophet by the name of john came forth
[20:54] out of the wilderness not from even a
[20:56] theological school
[20:58] whiskers all over his face a piece of
[21:00] sheepskin not in a clergy clothes
[21:02] come out and announce the kingdom of god
[21:05] is at hand
[21:07] and the people could hardly understand
[21:09] such an outfit is that coming with no
[21:11] identification of any any system
[21:13] anything that he belonged to any
[21:15] fellowship card or any denomination that
[21:18] he was backing him up
[21:20] message was too great he couldn't take
[21:23] man god school him out in the wilderness
[21:25] his message was not on some kind of a
[21:28] theological terms he spoke of serpents
[21:30] and axes and trees and that's what he
[21:33] was used to
[21:34] nature watching it how it worked
[21:37] and that was the
[21:38] way he approached not as a clergyman but
[21:41] as
[21:42] as a man of nature
[21:45] and uh the people clearly understand he
[21:47] didn't even have a pulpit probably
[21:49] wasn't welcoming any but he preached on
[21:52] the banks of the yard and probably
[21:53] standing in mud
[21:54] up half to his knees
[21:57] but the people come out to hear it those
[21:58] who were honest in heart
[22:00] they wanted to hear because it was
[22:02] something different it had a ring of
[22:04] truth to it
[22:05] today we ought to be it just at the
[22:07] approaching of the birth of christ our
[22:09] message you'd ought to have a ring of
[22:10] truth to it that would make people
[22:13] thirst
[22:14] to finding
[22:17] god took that simple man without
[22:19] education not one day in school
[22:22] and yet said he was the greatest among
[22:23] all the prophets that ever lived because
[22:26] god identifies himself in unidentified
[22:29] things
[22:30] when jesus chose his disciples it was
[22:32] there were many man better qualified for
[22:35] the job than those disciples
[22:37] they were clergymen you never call one
[22:40] they were clergymen in them days great
[22:42] man priest
[22:44] man of education renowned man but he
[22:46] never called him he took fishermen
[22:48] and
[22:51] tax collectors and so forth to
[22:54] send his message out he always does it
[22:56] in the days of noah
[22:58] he chose a farmer
[23:00] just a common farmer to announce the
[23:03] destruction of that age
[23:06] just a common farmer not a clergyman
[23:09] just a farmer
[23:11] in the days of noah he took a apartment
[23:14] in the days of moses he took a runaway
[23:17] slave
[23:19] not a clergyman
[23:21] and he let him get out till he was
[23:22] satisfied out in the backside of the
[23:24] desert and lose his education
[23:27] and appeared to him in a burning bush
[23:30] and sent him down with a crooked stick
[23:32] in his hand to take over a nation that
[23:35] hit run from
[23:39] see god takes the simple things
[23:42] to
[23:43] identify himself through
[23:45] see taken is just his word he made the
[23:48] world out of the things that
[23:51] it does has not appeared
[23:54] a few days ago i was at the mars
[23:56] auditorium
[23:57] one of our great new york campaigns
[24:00] and i was hearing a lecture on einstein
[24:02] speaking of this galaxy
[24:04] that said take a hundred and
[24:06] fifty million years of light time to go
[24:10] out to it in 150 million years to get
[24:13] back and then
[24:14] just think 150 million light years that
[24:17] would be 300 million light years
[24:20] and then when you got back here you'd
[24:22] only been gone 50 years i think my fast
[24:25] light travels later 86 000
[24:28] miles per minute and think of how
[24:31] many billions and trillions of years it
[24:34] would take
[24:35] to go out there and come back a hundred
[24:37] and twenty
[24:39] three hundred million light years and
[24:41] that's just to a galaxy
[24:43] in the constellation the god just blew
[24:45] from his hands and he may be
[24:48] eons of time
[24:49] in light years beyond that
[24:52] and they're looking down upon that then
[24:54] this
[24:54] a russian said that he's about 150 200
[24:57] miles up in the air said he never seen
[24:59] no god or angels how simple can man get
[25:02] it
[25:04] and then
[25:05] think of all them billions and trillions
[25:08] of years and only 50 years from here
[25:10] what did you do broke into
[25:12] eternity they say this astronaut that
[25:15] just went up was up so many hours went
[25:17] so many 17 times around the world or
[25:19] whatever it was they said every it
[25:22] wasn't one second in his life he was
[25:24] traveling with the time
[25:25] so i see you break into eternity that's
[25:28] the greatness of god some our minds
[25:30] cannot fathom how great he is and yet
[25:32] when he gets ready to reveal himself he
[25:35] makes it so simple
[25:37] takes the simple things to do it
[25:39] the simplicity
[25:42] david
[25:43] you seem to be the uh all of jesse's
[25:46] seven sons
[25:47] he was the last one to be brought before
[25:49] the prophet
[25:51] while even his own folks could
[25:54] laugh they couldn't imagine a little
[25:56] ruddy looking david a little
[25:58] stoop-shouldered ruddy-looking man to be
[26:00] the man that would be the king of israel
[26:04] he might not look like a king to those
[26:06] people but he sure must look like it's a
[26:08] god because he he anointed him king
[26:10] anyhow
[26:11] see he took the simple of david's family
[26:14] or jesus family to to make king
[26:17] something that the world had turned down
[26:20] the eterna sent him back to take care of
[26:22] the sheep he
[26:24] brought forth his forth his first son a
[26:26] great strong
[26:27] stately looking man probably could stand
[26:29] erect look like a king of israel
[26:32] and that's the one they thought would
[26:33] look good with the crown on his head
[26:35] that's the one with where the the kingly
[26:38] garment
[26:40] and could pack the staff and whatever
[26:43] must be done to a king he looked good to
[26:45] the eyes of the people
[26:47] but the prophet with anointing oil in
[26:49] his hand said heaven he got another one
[26:52] and he brought him one by one and so
[26:54] finally he said haven't you got another
[26:56] one
[26:57] he said i've got one but perhaps he
[26:58] wouldn't be nothing
[27:00] he's just a little dried up sort of a
[27:01] fellow he got him out there heard in
[27:03] sheep and said go get him
[27:05] and as soon as he fell in the eyes of
[27:08] the anointed prophet he poured all upon
[27:10] his hand head and running to meet him he
[27:11] said this is the one god chose
[27:15] see it's not tinsel always of the world
[27:19] it's god's choosing
[27:21] by grace he chose us
[27:24] so we're grateful for that this morning
[27:26] and it doesn't take those
[27:27] great tinsel things of the world the
[27:30] homeless can be a servant of christ take
[27:32] somebody who's willing god anointed him
[27:35] so he takes the little things now why
[27:37] did he take little bethlehem seemed like
[27:40] there would have been greater places
[27:43] that the king
[27:44] great king of kings could been born
[27:47] usually when we fix up an event here on
[27:50] earth we try to get it the highest
[27:52] most glittering thing that we can think
[27:54] of
[27:55] we take it to the biggest places and
[27:57] spend the most money and the most
[27:59] elaborate things that's the way we do it
[28:02] but god don't do it that way
[28:04] he takes something that's nothing
[28:06] so he can show himself to be mighty
[28:09] that he can if he'd talk a high priest
[28:11] or a well-trained man
[28:13] in the days when he's calling the
[28:15] apostles if he took that instead of an
[28:17] ignorant unlearned fisherman who
[28:18] couldn't even write his own name they
[28:20] can say oh that seer education pays off
[28:23] but god took a man who couldn't even
[28:25] ride his name
[28:27] that he could take something he could
[28:28] get in his hand
[28:30] something that he can make something out
[28:32] of to show that he's gone
[28:34] we get to a place that we realize that
[28:36] we're nothing
[28:38] then get in god's hands and he can mold
[28:40] you make you the way he wants you to be
[28:44] but as long as we feel that we're
[28:45] important
[28:46] then you'll never get nowhere you can't
[28:48] even get in the hands of god until we
[28:50] realize that we're not important
[28:53] one of my little girls was asking the
[28:55] other day about importancy i said well
[28:57] talk about some important man well it
[28:59] was a president
[29:01] that was just assassinated and our
[29:02] hearts as grieved over it and i said
[29:04] well he was an important man
[29:06] the papers plated up the television shot
[29:08] at billions and billions of dollars it
[29:10] cost the government to broadcast that
[29:12] which that's all right that's their
[29:13] business
[29:14] but i said this little
[29:16] pentecostal preacher up there in kalani
[29:18] a man walked in a drunk with a shotgun
[29:21] called for his wife and shot the man
[29:23] come out of the pool fitness shot his
[29:24] wife and shot himself a little piece in
[29:26] the back of the paper about that thing
[29:29] let me tell you brother
[29:30] no matter who we are if you want to know
[29:33] how important you are say them a little
[29:34] girl stick your finger in a bucket of
[29:35] water pull it out and try to find the
[29:37] hole
[29:39] we are nothing
[29:40] they're only one important that's god
[29:44] we must remember he's the one
[29:47] look like
[29:48] if they wanted to man had been fixing a
[29:50] place for the king to be born
[29:52] there was more greater religious places
[29:56] and historical places for the king
[29:58] instead of this little bethlehem
[30:01] places for instance like shiloh
[30:04] shallows where the ark was pitched first
[30:06] we know as we come across were come
[30:07] across the jordan to this side
[30:10] in palestine
[30:12] and where the ark was set up for its
[30:13] first worship please
[30:15] or gilgal zion
[30:17] zion a great place gilgal also
[30:21] are the proud great capital of jerusalem
[30:25] where the heads of all the organizations
[30:27] gathered at their headquarters looked
[30:29] like they'd have fixed the place up
[30:31] there at jerusalem for the great king to
[30:33] be born
[30:34] if they wanted a place a historical
[30:36] place or a great outstanding place
[30:37] that's where the religious headquarters
[30:39] was of their religion to which the king
[30:43] came to
[30:45] he came to represent their religion
[30:50] and he
[30:51] and when he did
[30:53] instead of them fixing a place at
[30:55] jerusalem or one of those great
[30:56] historical spots
[30:58] he was born in bethlehem
[31:01] the smallest of all the cities are
[31:03] though not
[31:04] least among the princes of judea
[31:08] but out of these shall come a governor
[31:10] that shall rule my people
[31:13] and this great proud jerusalem and all
[31:15] the other cities
[31:17] was rejected
[31:18] or maybe they could took some of the
[31:20] places of refuge the great place like
[31:23] hebron katie's
[31:25] rhema gilead one of those great refuge
[31:27] city because he was to be our refuge if
[31:31] we're crying fixing our own mind we
[31:33] might have to say well now if this great
[31:35] king's coming which will be our refuge
[31:37] he should be born in one of these great
[31:39] memorial places of a refuge like uh
[31:42] raymond gilead or katie sure or one of
[31:45] those we would have tried to fix it like
[31:47] that in our minds
[31:49] but you see god has other ways of doing
[31:51] things he knows how to do things right
[31:54] now by the mind of god and the help of
[31:56] god we'll try to say why did this happen
[31:59] because everything works just exactly
[32:01] right
[32:02] in god's great program and i want you
[32:05] people here at phoenix and around
[32:07] to try to get this that remember
[32:10] that
[32:11] god knows what he's
[32:12] doing and he takes simple means to do it
[32:16] by
[32:16] because if he does something by some
[32:18] great outstanding something then god
[32:21] never does do things like that he never
[32:24] did in all the history of the bible
[32:27] god never did deal never did in any time
[32:30] take any group of people to do anything
[32:32] god takes an individual
[32:35] you're the one
[32:36] you one person
[32:38] god never changes his program because
[32:40] his first program he must always remain
[32:42] with that program
[32:44] in the days of noah had one man noah
[32:47] the days that he brought israel out he
[32:49] had one man
[32:51] that was moses we know what david and
[32:54] many others tried to think well they had
[32:56] the same authority and so forth you know
[32:58] what happened to them
[32:59] the days of the coming of the lord the
[33:00] days of
[33:01] john the baptist and the different ones
[33:03] he has one individual he works with and
[33:06] he deals with us today as one individual
[33:08] not as a group one person
[33:12] it's going to be up to you and i
[33:14] how we stand before god because he's
[33:16] dealing with you and i
[33:18] as individuals
[33:20] not as a group that we're in
[33:22] and not if the the nomination church we
[33:24] belong to but as you and i as
[33:26] individuals
[33:28] now josh away in dividing up the land
[33:30] give this little spot to judah
[33:32] many of y'all have got some places here
[33:34] jotted down to where it sets that but
[33:36] we're all aware of that
[33:39] where it sets up in the corner and it
[33:41] was just a little place that they give
[33:43] it to joshua in dividing the land give
[33:46] that to the tribe of judah
[33:49] and
[33:50] now
[33:52] when israel come over the river of
[33:55] jordan now try to catch this
[33:57] when israel crossed over into the land
[34:00] the promised land there was a gentile
[34:03] woman that we know as rahab the harlot
[34:07] and she asked for mercy
[34:10] and she received mercy
[34:12] she received mercy as long as she stayed
[34:14] under that scarlet card
[34:17] and that's the only way she could have
[34:18] mercy it was a sign of tolkien that was
[34:20] giving her we have a token today also
[34:23] and we're safe as long as we stay under
[34:25] our scarlet card the blood of jesus
[34:28] christ as an individual not a group an
[34:30] individual we each must stay under that
[34:33] scarlet card of the blood of jesus
[34:35] christ
[34:37] and then this rehab after she was spared
[34:40] she got all her people in everything
[34:42] that was under the card was was saved
[34:44] just like when god in
[34:46] egypt when all was under the blood was
[34:48] saved all was under the scarlet card was
[34:50] saved all under the blood of jesus is
[34:53] saved all out from uttered is lost
[34:55] and it's ready for destruction
[34:58] and we find out now in doing this then
[35:02] we understand by history that she
[35:05] courted some general i don't know his
[35:07] name right now in israel's army
[35:10] and she finally married this man
[35:13] and they
[35:15] settled up here in this near this little
[35:17] place and her son solomon was the one
[35:20] who founded
[35:21] bethlehem
[35:23] see a gentile is connected with it to
[35:25] begin with
[35:26] a gentile rahab the heart
[35:29] now we find out that salomon
[35:31] founded this little city of bethlehem
[35:34] and he bega got boaz
[35:38] and boaz was the one who married ruth
[35:41] another gentile
[35:44] and
[35:45] we're following this lean each now
[35:47] ruth
[35:49] she got
[35:50] she was a mobianite and she married boaz
[35:53] and came in to this little city just in
[35:58] barley season
[36:00] oh if we had the time this morning uh on
[36:03] that i'd owe my wife six dresses
[36:05] afterwards but
[36:06] how to dwell on that subject neoma
[36:10] representing the orthodox church was
[36:12] went away on the count of a famine
[36:17] went over into the land of voya like the
[36:19] scattering of israel all out among the
[36:21] nations and then as she came back she
[36:24] brought back ruth the mobinite
[36:28] and she returned just in barley season
[36:31] just the gathering in of the first
[36:34] barley
[36:36] that is that the gentile church coming
[36:39] to god just at barley season again
[36:43] what a beautiful picture there and then
[36:45] she and boaz being married
[36:48] and their famous son over it
[36:51] was begotten there and also born
[36:54] and then his son great son jesse came
[36:58] from over
[37:00] there also
[37:02] he
[37:03] begat david
[37:05] his son
[37:07] the king david come out look at this
[37:10] coming up now from rehab the harlot
[37:12] her son founding it from that come um
[37:16] from that come boaz which brought in
[37:18] another gentile
[37:20] and then from boaz uh come jesse and
[37:23] here jesse
[37:25] uh to jesse was born david
[37:28] and
[37:29] david right here at this same little
[37:32] bethlehem was anointed by the prophet of
[37:34] god to be the king of israel
[37:36] all these spiritual things
[37:40] hid from the eyes of the world what's
[37:42] happening here in this little city of
[37:45] bethlehem
[37:47] see that's the way god does now i trust
[37:51] that the holy spirit will be present now
[37:53] to give you a correct understanding
[37:56] that god doesn't work out in these big
[37:58] things
[37:59] it's by the spirit
[38:01] not by power not by might but by my
[38:04] spirit saith the lord
[38:06] see god working in the spirit among the
[38:10] people see these great backgrounds
[38:13] he could only come to this city that's
[38:16] the only place he could be born god
[38:18] following his same line
[38:20] god always does that
[38:23] god follows the line of his word he
[38:27] cannot go back on his word by no means
[38:30] and then remain god he's got to stay
[38:32] with the word
[38:34] he can never leave that today our
[38:36] traditions and so forth take us from the
[38:38] word we have creeds and things we inject
[38:41] into the word which pollutes the whole
[38:42] thing
[38:44] but god can never leave the line of his
[38:46] word his word is true always because he
[38:48] is the word
[38:50] god and his word is the same
[38:52] now we see here how that this little
[38:55] bethlehem yet being unnoticed
[38:58] a little place not noticed too much to
[39:00] the outside world just the smallest of
[39:03] the cities nobody paid any attention to
[39:05] it but yet god had in his purpose that
[39:08] that's where all these things have
[39:10] happened now the spiritual mind would
[39:12] pick that up because the prophet said
[39:14] here you see the prophet said thou
[39:16] bethlehem of judea are thou not the
[39:18] least among the princes but out of thee
[39:20] shall come a governor that shall rule my
[39:23] people israel
[39:24] the prophet the mind of the prophet
[39:28] found it what's those spiritual holy
[39:31] spirit today leading those things don't
[39:33] make endeavors what the world says and
[39:35] all of its tinsel what's the holy spirit
[39:37] in the word
[39:39] there's word come how about when job
[39:42] died
[39:43] and specified his burial place along
[39:46] came
[39:47] abraham abraham bought the partial
[39:50] ground to bury his wife sarah and
[39:52] abraham when he died wanted to be buried
[39:55] with sarah abraham begot isaac isaac
[39:58] when he died wanted to be buried with
[39:59] abraham isaac begot jacob jacob died
[40:02] plumbed down in egypt but he made joseph
[40:05] his prophet's son swear by him with his
[40:07] hand on his living hip that he would not
[40:09] bury him down in egypt
[40:11] why
[40:12] said take me up into the land
[40:15] and there let him be buried and joseph
[40:17] when he died down in egypt made mention
[40:19] of the departing of an israel going out
[40:21] according to the prophecy but said take
[40:23] my bones out of this land
[40:25] why they knew the first fruits of the
[40:28] resurrection was coming up from that
[40:30] land because job said i know my redeemer
[40:34] liveth not the last days he'll stand up
[40:36] on the earth and though the skin worms
[40:37] destroys this body yet in my flesh shall
[40:39] i see god
[40:41] they knew that first fruits of
[40:42] resurrection was coming out of the
[40:44] promised land not egypt
[40:46] they were spiritual they were prophets
[40:49] and when jesus died on on good friday
[40:52] and raised up on easter morning the
[40:54] following sunday morning the bible said
[40:56] that many of the saints that slept in
[40:58] the dusty earth raised up and come out
[41:00] of the graves went into the city went on
[41:03] in the glory with him why it was in
[41:05] prophets that knowed exactly where to be
[41:06] buried at the place and at the time
[41:09] is hid from the eyes of the wise but
[41:11] they knew what what they looked at the
[41:13] spirit side
[41:15] the the first fruits of the resurrection
[41:17] was to come out of palestine not out of
[41:19] egypt
[41:21] so is it today friends so many people
[41:24] hold on to things of the world or some
[41:25] great system or something bury me in
[41:27] jesus for those that are in christ will
[41:29] god bring with him that resurrection i
[41:31] don't care what the world's got to say
[41:33] how much they try to tensilize things
[41:35] it's in christ those that are in christ
[41:37] that god will bring with him
[41:39] the spiritual mind catches those
[41:40] spiritual things here the prophet said
[41:43] little bethlehem art thou not the least
[41:45] among all the princes of judah but out
[41:48] of these shall come this governor
[41:50] not out of the big self-style capital
[41:52] not out of some historical church
[41:53] grounds or something where the methodist
[41:55] baptist presbyterian pentecostal a lot
[41:57] more started but out of the least of
[41:59] these have a little insignificant place
[42:01] where i bring forth this place my ruler
[42:04] of the people
[42:07] but today we won't say our fathers did
[42:08] this and our fathers did that see god
[42:10] ignores every bit of that
[42:13] god does what he wants to watch the line
[42:15] of the spirit watch the way the the
[42:16] scripture reads they were ignorant to
[42:18] that
[42:19] but you see the scripture is what's
[42:21] right always god is right
[42:23] david was anointed by this great prophet
[42:26] to be king no doubt that samuel this
[42:28] great prophet knew these things
[42:30] beforehand
[42:31] and it was there
[42:33] that
[42:33] his great promised spiritual seed
[42:38] for god swore by an oath that he would
[42:40] raise up christ to set on the throne of
[42:43] david
[42:44] then where else could christ be born
[42:48] here is his father born his
[42:50] grandfather's great grandfather great
[42:51] great great great great home back
[42:54] see his people in the line of the
[42:55] gentiles brought in and now the bible
[42:58] said that in his name will the gentiles
[43:00] trust
[43:01] it all has to be brought in so you can
[43:03] see it we like to stay there for a while
[43:06] and dwell on that and show you why the
[43:07] gentiles but i'm sure the spiritual mind
[43:09] will catch this right away now because
[43:11] being the mothers and not the father
[43:13] now
[43:14] because it was the woman the bride the
[43:16] gentile will be made up the bride will
[43:19] be made up of gentiles
[43:21] the gentile he'll take a people out of
[43:23] the gentiles for his namesake that's his
[43:26] name he took a wife
[43:27] see out of the gentiles that's how it
[43:30] had to be woman come in church and she
[43:32] would they were gentiles the
[43:34] grandmothers back in the line of the
[43:36] seed now just as isaac was in the line
[43:39] of the seat otherwise
[43:40] now notice this we find out then that
[43:44] david had this promise of a son
[43:48] now we notice how that parallels again
[43:52] with israel
[43:53] where israel or
[43:55] abraham was promised in his seed
[43:59] what it would be
[44:00] that out of his seed would come this
[44:02] great savior and he be father all the
[44:04] nations his natural seed of course was
[44:07] isaac and it failed
[44:09] but his spiritual seed by the faith that
[44:11] he had come christ which brought in all
[44:14] of the nations
[44:15] well now the same thing is parallel here
[44:18] again david's natural seed was solomon
[44:22] and it backslid just like the other seed
[44:24] of abraham did it backslid
[44:27] so did solomon backslide you got too
[44:30] many women and the first thing you know
[44:32] they let his heart away from god and the
[44:34] way he went and backslid died that way
[44:38] eventually israel died in the same way
[44:42] vaccine but we find out that this
[44:45] spiritual seed which was promised by the
[44:48] natural seed as a lineage of people
[44:51] coming through abraham but as a the
[44:53] kingship come through the spiritual
[44:55] promise of david
[44:57] and david was born in bethlehem
[45:00] and he was anointed in bethlehem
[45:03] and then we find out then that when his
[45:05] real royal uh seed heir to his throne
[45:09] was born in this same city little
[45:12] bethlehem now at least amongst all the
[45:15] princes of judah but out of he shall
[45:16] come a governor that shall rule my
[45:18] people in this little town little stable
[45:22] city stable down on the side of the
[45:24] bluff was a cave back in the bluff and
[45:28] out of there came
[45:30] forth through its little doors the
[45:33] prince of peace
[45:34] born in a stable in a
[45:37] a little box of of straw sitting
[45:39] somewhere
[45:40] manure piled up in the barns and so
[45:42] forth but out of there came that great
[45:45] princess the seed of the woman out of
[45:48] there came the savior the world out of
[45:49] there came jehovah himself in the form
[45:51] of a man came out of that little humble
[45:54] stable in bethlehem
[45:56] not in some king's palace born in
[45:58] royalty but there he came from that
[46:01] humble place to a manure stack down in
[46:04] there and was wrapped in swelling's
[46:06] clothes tradition says it was taken from
[46:08] the yoke of an ox where they've been
[46:09] planned with him poor people joseph and
[46:12] mary both real poor and here they was in
[46:16] this little stable how humble god makes
[46:19] himself and then we try to make
[46:21] ourselves something great can't you see
[46:23] how god humbles himself and takes the
[46:25] things it's not that he might bring to
[46:27] pass his great promises
[46:31] how that little jehovah laying in a
[46:34] manger wrapped in the the cloth taken
[46:37] off of the back of a yoke uh the neck of
[46:40] a yoke where ox had been and wrapped the
[46:42] prince of peace in it
[46:44] who are we then what do we deserve if
[46:47] god can humble himself like that often
[46:48] we to be able to humble ourselves to
[46:50] become his servant if he did things like
[46:52] that can't we forget our
[46:55] uh dignities and things of this world
[46:57] and pass from that and humble ourselves
[46:59] before him this christmas and be
[47:01] showing our appreciations of that birth
[47:03] and that humility by humbling our own
[47:05] selves
[47:06] and receiving his word no matter what
[47:08] the tradition says it's his word that
[47:09] counts
[47:10] that's what he'll take his word and that
[47:13] only now we find out
[47:16] this little stable
[47:17] it was there that the first noel was
[47:20] ever saying on earth and it was singed
[47:22] by angels
[47:24] think of it the first noil not sung up
[47:27] there with campuses not down at some
[47:30] great fine church where a wonderful
[47:31] pastor was but at a stable
[47:35] in bethlehem the least among all of them
[47:38] but the first oil was sang by angelic
[47:41] beings in the little city of bethlehem
[47:44] see what i mean no matter how poor you
[47:47] are how little or insignificant you
[47:49] might be
[47:50] god can use you if you'll just let him
[47:52] do so
[47:54] god wants you you don't want you you
[47:56] don't have to belong to some great
[47:57] society some great order or some great
[48:00] uh brotherhood or whatever it might be
[48:02] that don't mean nothing to god god wants
[48:04] you
[48:06] and if you're if you feel that you're
[48:08] great get that feeling out of you
[48:11] you've got to get it out you say well i
[48:12] have a phd lld that just takes you that
[48:15] much further from god forget the thing
[48:17] come back to god come back to the
[48:19] humility of the spirit and love god and
[48:22] take his word if you abide me in my word
[48:25] in you then ask what you will it'll be
[48:27] done for you
[48:28] god promise that
[48:30] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[48:32] don't doubt your heart but believe that
[48:33] what you say will come to pass you can
[48:35] have what you said
[48:37] he that believeth on me the works that i
[48:39] do shall he also even greater than this
[48:41] shall he do for i go to my father what
[48:43] promises
[48:45] there's something lacking somewhere what
[48:46] we try to do is twist it up and make it
[48:48] some great something up there put fire
[48:50] and tissue on it and we pollute it just
[48:52] like the nations has done christmas
[48:56] if we could get the tinsel off of the
[48:57] things of the the humility back in the
[49:00] human heart if we could bring the
[49:01] humility back to christmas what it ought
[49:03] to be not a commercial day not lights
[49:06] and santa clauses but back to worship in
[49:08] the god of creation who come at a stable
[49:11] it was born a baby god made flesh and
[49:14] dwelt among us we could come back to
[49:17] that get away from the tits on the big
[49:18] things god don't even deal with it all
[49:20] you say well i belong to the biggest
[49:22] organization that takes you that much
[49:23] farther from god
[49:25] you say i do this that that just takes
[49:26] you that much further you've got to
[49:28] humble yourself until you see that
[49:30] until if you abide me in my words abide
[49:33] in you
[49:35] and ask what you will
[49:37] what we try to do this is what god gives
[49:39] us a little shower of blessings we try
[49:41] to twist it all up and get dignitaries
[49:43] in there let's go to make great big
[49:44] names now do the other nissan starts
[49:46] this way and that way god leaves a whole
[49:47] thing
[49:49] what we need today is a fresh pouring
[49:51] out of the holy spirit upon hearts
[49:54] that's humble we need a real christmas
[49:56] of birthplace if you could realize that
[49:58] you're nothing but a stable
[50:00] god didn't go to jerusalem to shiloh or
[50:02] ramos gilead he come to a stable
[50:06] that was polluted
[50:09] you let god you become and realize in
[50:12] yourself that you're nothing but a
[50:13] stinking stable
[50:15] but welcome open your doors when these
[50:17] great big places and the ends are
[50:18] turning away open your doors of the
[50:21] manger your heart and let jehovah come
[50:23] into that and watch what takes place
[50:25] for he is the word he said if you abide
[50:27] me in my word in you
[50:28] he is the word let him come into you
[50:31] watch what takes place then ask what you
[50:33] will and it'll be done for you yes it
[50:35] was there the first noel was
[50:38] by angels many years ago
[50:46] now we know the message must be very
[50:48] important that god wanted to say that or
[50:50] he broke in on a message to do something
[50:52] like that
[50:53] humble yourselves or the hands of god
[50:55] was the message of him
[50:57] now
[50:58] our heavenly father
[51:00] we know that our all wisdom and does
[51:02] everything just right
[51:04] we pray that you'll grant now that this
[51:07] might be a message to the people that
[51:09] they truly must humble ourselves all of
[51:12] us and come under the hand of the mighty
[51:14] god
[51:15] we commit ourselves to you father that
[51:17] you'll grant this to us in jesus name my
[51:19] son
[51:20] amen
[51:22] now to continue on
[51:24] i was speaking
[51:25] of when the first noel
[51:28] was saying was saying by angels at
[51:30] little bethlehem
[51:32] there's where all these great men were
[51:35] born that's where the promise of the
[51:37] king was born the promised king came to
[51:39] that now the word to get quickly now so
[51:42] i won't hold you too long the uh a
[51:44] promise the word was this the word
[51:47] bethlehem
[51:49] let's break it down
[51:50] i skipped over a few notes here in order
[51:52] to take up the time now bethlehem the
[51:56] word b-e-t-h
[51:57] means house
[52:00] e-l means god in hebrew e-l-h-e-m is
[52:03] bread
[52:05] bethlehem the house
[52:07] of god's bread that's what the word
[52:10] means
[52:11] words names
[52:13] they have meanings
[52:15] many people don't believe that but
[52:17] that's true
[52:18] if names don't have some meaning why did
[52:21] abram's name have to be changed to
[52:23] abraham
[52:24] why did sarah have to be changed to
[52:25] sarah
[52:27] why does saul have to be changed to paul
[52:30] why simon has to be changed to peter
[52:35] all these has meanings everything has
[52:37] meanings and the name bethlehem means
[52:41] the house of god's brain now how fitting
[52:44] that is to jesus the bread of eternal
[52:47] life
[52:48] christ is the bread of life we all
[52:50] believe that don't we how fitting
[52:52] bethlehem there the bread center of the
[52:55] world was the bread center of eternal
[52:58] life that's why the king had to be born
[53:00] there he said in saint john 6 35 i am
[53:04] the bread of life
[53:06] that come from god out of heaven
[53:08] your fathers did eat manna in the
[53:09] wilderness and all dead but this spread
[53:13] if a man eats this bread he shall live
[53:15] forever
[53:17] then jesus is the bread of life
[53:20] so the bread of life had to come at
[53:22] bethlehem he is our bread of life for
[53:26] the journey like israel god gave israel
[53:29] bread out of the skies for their journey
[53:33] as they journeyed from where they
[53:35] left egypt unto the promised land bread
[53:38] nightly rain down from the sky
[53:41] and god gave us the bread of life for
[53:43] our journey come at bethlehem god's
[53:46] house of bragging see how it had to be
[53:49] it must be where that name is called
[53:52] bethlehem the house of god's bread
[53:56] then how could he be born in jerusalem
[53:59] how could he be born in ramos gilead see
[54:02] he come to where his name was house of
[54:06] god's bread
[54:08] oh
[54:09] notice
[54:10] israel receive a new fresh bread every
[54:14] night coming down from heaven for their
[54:17] journey
[54:18] christ is our life bread of life and
[54:21] every day we receive a freshness from
[54:24] christ from heaven the holy spirit
[54:26] coming down upon the believer every day
[54:30] fresh
[54:31] yesterday's experience many of us live
[54:33] on yesterday's experience we mustn't do
[54:36] that it's today's experience that's
[54:39] what's the matter with our denominations
[54:40] they're living on the experience of john
[54:42] wesley upon the experience of dwight
[54:44] moody
[54:45] finney sankey knox calvin many of those
[54:48] back there that are living on that
[54:49] experience but remember the bread that
[54:52] fell and they tried to keep it over it
[54:54] got contaminated
[54:56] maggots got in it
[54:58] little wiggle tails and that's what's
[55:00] the matter today contaminated cisterns
[55:03] living off past bread that's
[55:05] contaminated we must have something
[55:07] fresh from christ his word today for
[55:09] this hour
[55:10] he is our freshness our bread that falls
[55:14] every day from heaven upon the believer
[55:17] he is our bethlehem god's house of
[55:20] eternal life bread christ was born in
[55:24] bethlehem and became god's house
[55:27] of eternal life bread he is the bread of
[55:31] life he is our bethlehem
[55:34] christ is our bethlehem natural bread is
[55:38] called the staff of life
[55:40] we call the natural bread like our light
[55:42] bread and stuff we get is called the
[55:43] staff of life jesus is god's life staff
[55:47] of a bread of life staff for eternal
[55:51] life as the staff of life is called
[55:53] bread jesus being the bread of life is
[55:56] god's staff of eternal life bread to us
[56:01] see we can't go
[56:03] something must
[56:04] die so we can eat this morning when you
[56:07] eat you eat dead substance if something
[56:10] doesn't die then you cannot live cause
[56:12] you only live by dead substance
[56:14] if you eat meat the hog died eat pork
[56:17] the hog diet of course then if you eat
[56:19] the
[56:21] beef the cow died you said but i eat
[56:23] bread then the wheat died well i ate
[56:25] greens the greens died you only live by
[56:28] dead substance and that's the only way
[56:30] you can live then if you can only live
[56:32] natural by dead substance something had
[56:34] to die so you can live natural how much
[56:37] more did something have to die so you
[56:38] live eternally
[56:40] christ died
[56:42] that we might live eternally and he
[56:45] become the house of god's eternal life
[56:48] bread
[56:49] that we catch freshly every hour of the
[56:52] day coming down from god out of heaven
[56:54] in the form of the holy spirit
[56:56] feeds our hungry souls as we set
[56:58] together in heavenly places he is our
[57:01] bethlehem
[57:02] that all true believing sons of god are
[57:06] born in bethlehem with him
[57:09] if christ had to become
[57:11] the bread of life
[57:13] to be born in bethlehem which is
[57:16] life's bread house
[57:18] then every one of true believers in
[57:21] christ is born in christ they are born
[57:25] in god's bethlehem
[57:27] amen then only jesus was born in
[57:29] bethlehem i was born in bethlehem you
[57:32] were born in bethlehem how did you do it
[57:34] right you're in phoenix arizona this
[57:36] morning in the remark you can be born
[57:38] again in god's bethlehem
[57:40] house of eternal bread life
[57:42] he's going to live forever
[57:45] why little bethlehem that's today why a
[57:47] bunch of little holy rollers why this
[57:49] that or the other that people don't know
[57:51] what it's all about but the spirit
[57:52] reveals if the word chose it it's a
[57:55] manifestation of god's word
[57:57] we have life through christ in him alone
[58:00] our organizations our denominations our
[58:02] differences only separates us from god
[58:04] we have one access to god and that's
[58:06] through jesus christ there's not another
[58:08] way that we can come through but no
[58:10] priest no preacher no system or nothing
[58:12] else only jesus christ and him crucified
[58:14] he's god's bread of life
[58:17] and we are born in him and if he is
[58:19] god's breath of life and he is bethlehem
[58:23] and being born in christ we are then god
[58:26] born in bethlehem in christ jesus
[58:29] setting together in heavenly places
[58:31] eating of him
[58:33] eating of him who is he he's the word in
[58:36] the beginning was the word and the word
[58:37] is with god and the word was god
[58:40] and when we can sit with one objective
[58:43] the word of god and feed up on there we
[58:45] are in god's spiritual bethlehem eating
[58:48] god's spiritual bread and our souls
[58:51] punctuating every
[58:53] word that he spoke with an amen
[58:55] we enjoy this heavenly angel food
[58:58] when it says these signs shall follow
[59:01] them to believe the creed of
[59:02] denomination says audience and soul but
[59:04] the real man who's born in bethlehem
[59:06] says amen
[59:08] the works that i do shall you do also
[59:10] the denomination says it's a bunch of
[59:12] work up emotion but the real bethlehem
[59:14] dweller says amen because he's satisfied
[59:18] that's angel food if you abide me in my
[59:21] words and you guess what you will
[59:23] that'll be done for you
[59:25] amen
[59:27] all the high and prudent will never sip
[59:30] we hold so much to our traditions over
[59:32] the elders so much that we have to pack
[59:34] cards and everything else to get in some
[59:36] pulpit that ain't it you can get in
[59:38] god's pulpit by humbling yourselves come
[59:41] into the house of the bread of life
[59:42] jesus christ and live forever in his
[59:45] presence and lifted up in heavenly
[59:47] places in christ jesus feasting on the
[59:50] word
[59:51] that's god's bethlehem how many of us is
[59:53] in it this morning how many is willing
[59:55] to forget your traditions how many would
[59:57] you forget your creed that disagrees
[59:58] with the word why we got a revival why
[1:00:01] haven't we got these things going on
[1:00:03] what's the matter with pentecost it
[1:00:04] organized itself that's you can't
[1:00:06] organize pentecost you can make an
[1:00:08] organization but the pentecost is a
[1:00:10] blessing it's a power of god and if it's
[1:00:12] a pentecost it'll never bypass a word
[1:00:15] for a creed
[1:00:16] it'll take the word
[1:00:19] but because it's circumcised
[1:00:22] from the world and the things of the
[1:00:24] world it sets only on the word of god
[1:00:27] we're in bethlehem
[1:00:29] candidates
[1:00:30] for the kingdom of god we're eating
[1:00:32] god's eternal life bread
[1:00:35] born god
[1:00:37] bread born in bethlehem to become the
[1:00:40] spiritual bread of life of eternal life
[1:00:43] in the house of god
[1:00:45] oh my
[1:00:46] born in bethlehem we are this morning
[1:00:49] when we're born in jesus christ for he
[1:00:51] is god's bethlehem jesus is god's house
[1:00:56] of eternal life bread he also is our
[1:01:00] water for the journey
[1:01:01] now we know that he is the water
[1:01:04] like israel in their journey even if
[1:01:06] they snort a rock and their bread come
[1:01:09] down out of heaven but a rock was
[1:01:11] smitten so that they could drink from it
[1:01:14] for the sustainings of their life in the
[1:01:16] journey
[1:01:17] god smote a rock or had moses to do it
[1:01:20] as prophet smoke the rock what was it
[1:01:23] open the rock if the rock was christ do
[1:01:26] you believe it
[1:01:27] all right then if the prophet opened the
[1:01:29] rock so life could come out then if it
[1:01:31] is a rock today we need the holy spirit
[1:01:34] and some man who will smite back the
[1:01:36] rock amen and let the word come out
[1:01:38] because he is the word
[1:01:40] we've got cast on creeds and drinking
[1:01:42] stagnated water from sisters
[1:01:45] what we need today is the opening of the
[1:01:47] worm
[1:01:48] that lives and he's the same yesterday
