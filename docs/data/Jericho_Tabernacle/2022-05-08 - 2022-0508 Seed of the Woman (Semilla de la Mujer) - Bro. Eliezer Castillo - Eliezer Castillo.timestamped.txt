[42:47] old for a christian
[42:53] christian because it's not something
[42:55] that was done a few years ago
[43:01] but grace is given continually every
[43:03] single day for us
[43:07] and if it wasn't for
[43:09] his grace and his mercy
[43:13] where would we be at today
[43:17] so then we can sing a song in our hearts
[43:19] we can have a story in our hearts
[43:24] and
[43:28] amen it's so good to be in the house of
[43:30] the lord today
[43:34] i greet you all in the precious name of
[43:36] our lord jesus christ
[43:53] uh yeah verse 14 all the way to verse
[43:55] verse 20.
[44:05] what a special day it is today amen
[44:10] amen but just like brother branham says
[44:12] every day for a mother is special
[44:20] the bible says
[44:23] and the lord god said unto the serpent
[44:25] because thou has done this thou has
[44:27] cursed above all cattle and above every
[44:29] beast of the field upon thy belly thou
[44:32] shalt go and dust shalt thou eat all the
[44:35] days of thy life
[44:48] and i will put enmity between thee and
[44:51] the woman
[44:52] and between thy seed and her seed it it
[44:55] shall bruise thy head and thou shall
[44:58] bruise his heel
[45:01] enemies
[45:15] he didn't only say i'll put enmity
[45:17] between her seed and your seeds
[45:24] but he said i'll put enmity between you
[45:26] and the woman
[45:32] it says unto the woman he said and i
[45:34] will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
[45:36] conception in the sorrow that thou shalt
[45:38] bring forth children and thy desire
[45:41] shall be to thy husband and he shall
[45:43] rule over thee
[45:57] and unto adam he said because thou has
[46:00] hearkened unto the voice of thy wife
[46:02] he
[46:03] and um has eaten of the fruit of the
[46:05] tree of the tree which i commanded thee
[46:08] saying thou shall not eat of it cursed
[46:11] it is the ground for thy sake
[46:13] in sorrow thou shalt eat all of the days
[46:15] of thy life
[46:32] thorns also and thistle shall bring
[46:34] forth thee and thou shalt eat of the
[46:36] herb of the field
[46:38] espinosicardos de produced
[46:42] in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[46:44] bread
[46:45] till thou return to the ground out of
[46:47] what thou has taken
[46:51] and for dust thou art that thus shalt
[46:54] thou return
[47:04] and adam called his wife's name eve
[47:07] because she was mother of all living
[47:18] heavenly father we just
[47:21] give this service into your hands lord
[47:26] lord we fill your presence we know that
[47:29] you are here because there have been
[47:30] people with expectation lord
[47:38] you said where there's two or three
[47:40] gathered in your name i shall be there
[47:41] in their midst
[47:47] father we're here gathered under your
[47:49] name under your word lord
[47:54] we ask that you just
[47:57] take control of this part of the service
[47:59] and be with us father and speak to us
[48:01] what we need lord
[48:04] is
[48:08] in the name of the lord jesus christ we
[48:09] pray
[48:11] amen amen
[48:12] amen
[48:13] amen you may be seated amen
[48:17] amen what a special time to be here
[48:23] you know
[48:24] as i was studying this message
[48:29] i was seeing
[48:30] how
[48:32] special mother is
[48:36] special
[48:37] how special if i could say how special
[48:40] that office is uh
[48:45] it's one of the greatest offices that i
[48:47] see in the bible
[48:51] it's the office of a mother
[48:55] because everything
[48:57] was
[48:58] that you see in the world
[49:14] i really um really like this scripture
[49:17] here
[49:20] it's always
[49:21] hit my heart in a special way
[49:27] when i first gave my heart to the lord
[49:32] god gave me a revelation that i stays
[49:35] with me to this day
[49:41] that that us the spiritual family in
[49:43] christ
[49:47] is so far greater than
[49:50] uh flesh and blood
[49:54] greater than than a bloodline
[50:10] should have a greater bond than we have
[50:13] with our own families
[50:19] unless our family is a child of god and
[50:22] is serving the lord then that bond is
[50:24] just as great
[50:32] timothy 5 and
[50:34] verse 5 it says
[50:39] yeah verse 1 it says rebuke not an elder
[50:42] but entreat him as a father and the
[50:44] younger man as brethren
[50:55] the elder women as mothers and the
[50:57] younger as sisters with all purity
[51:05] so we have mothers here today
[51:13] and if any any young sister needs help
[51:16] they have mothers everywhere that they
[51:18] can turn to isi
[51:33] and i have brothers here that can help
[51:35] me out with whatever i need brothers and
[51:37] sisters
[51:42] so today i just want to honor the
[51:44] mothers not only naturally but
[51:46] spiritually
[51:51] you're not only mothers of the ones that
[51:54] you you bore and you raise but you're
[51:56] mothers of all of us
[52:02] just as the fathers just says the
[52:04] brethren and the sisters
[52:08] i would like for all the the mothers to
[52:10] stand up and we can give them a clap
[52:12] offering
[52:17] [Applause]
[52:29] amen
[52:31] that's that's almost
[52:33] the majority of our church
[52:37] it's mother's son consists
[52:39] what what an office a mother
[52:42] holds amen
[52:45] um
[52:46] genesis 15
[52:48] is a very um
[52:51] if i could say in lack of better words
[52:53] it's the darkest day of history
[53:12] but in the midst of that the darkest day
[53:18] god shed light in that place
[53:22] in
[53:23] genesis 3 15 it says
[53:27] says i will put enmity between the woman
[53:31] and are between thee and the woman and
[53:33] between thy seed and her seed and it
[53:36] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[53:38] bruise his heel it is
[53:54] before god cursed adam and or cursed eve
[53:58] and and the ground through adam antos
[54:04] he
[54:05] gave a blessing first
[54:08] before any of the curses came to them
[54:10] first he gave the prophecy of hope
[54:18] showing that there was going to be a
[54:20] seed through a woman that was going to
[54:23] bruise the head of the serpent
[54:31] before he laid down judgment he laid
[54:34] down redemption already
[54:40] and he gave and he said it was going to
[54:42] come through a woman
[54:47] through eve
[54:48] came the fall
[54:50] binola
[54:52] it says that eve her name was the mother
[54:55] of all living
[55:00] and what came forth out of her came
[55:04] evil and came good okay
[55:11] through deception came or through the
[55:14] deception came heartaches from her out
[55:16] of her came the deception and heartache
[55:32] a woman it starts everything
[55:37] out of a mother
[55:40] and i'm
[55:41] i'm sure um
[55:43] sometimes it's hard to hear over and
[55:45] over that a woman is a byproduct
[55:52] that's nothing but the truth but
[55:54] sometimes it's a hard pill to take
[55:56] sometimes
[56:01] she was the weaker vessel because of
[56:02] what eve did she was the weaker vessel
[56:08] but i want you to remember
[56:12] that in the beginning
[56:14] before
[56:30] he didn't give the man something greater
[56:32] and the woman less it was both the same
[56:35] covenant the same promise
[56:43] and i believe that there's going to be a
[56:45] day
[56:46] okay
[56:47] when redemption is at its fullness
[56:52] where there won't be any byproduct
[56:54] anymore
[56:57] that we will all be completely redeemed
[57:00] into our original state
[57:06] so sisters i i believe that you have
[57:08] maybe something more to look forward to
[57:10] than men
[57:22] god will redeem you completely
[57:28] so when god cursed
[57:30] um gave his curses in in genesis 3 15.
[57:37] he said cursed this curse is to the
[57:40] serpent this is maldita
[57:44] you're going to be um
[57:45] dragging yourself dragging your yourself
[57:48] with your belly all the days of your
[57:50] life and you're going to eat dust it's
[57:51] important
[57:55] and he said
[57:57] gave the curse to the woman
[58:00] so that you're going to have sorrow by
[58:03] conceiving and bearing children
[58:09] and your desires to your husband and
[58:10] you're going to be subject to him
[58:15] and to adam he said curse it be the
[58:17] ground
[58:20] because you listen to your wife curse it
[58:22] be the ground and
[58:24] and in sorrow you're going to eat these
[58:26] the fruit of the ground
[58:33] but when redemption fully takes place
[58:39] god is going to take those curses out
[58:43] god is going to fully redeem the land
[58:49] where there's no more sin on us anymore
[58:54] and god's going to take the curse off of
[58:56] the woman
[59:00] and and she won't have to
[59:02] have that curse upon her anymore
[59:07] and uh
[59:08] i was reading a scripture in isaiah 65.
[59:14] and uh if you look at isaiah 65 25.
[59:22] this is in the great millennium
[59:24] millennium he says the wolf and the lamb
[59:27] shall feed together
[59:28] the lion shall eat straw like the
[59:30] bullock and dust shall be the serpent's
[59:35] meat
[59:36] they shall not hurt or destroy in my
[59:39] holy mountains thus saith the lord
[59:55] it made me realize that god takes away
[59:57] those curses of of the ground and the
[1:00:00] woman but he keeps that curse on the
[1:00:02] serpent
[1:00:09] he keeps that curse on the devil
[1:00:22] if the brothers can let me know when 45
[1:00:24] minutes are up
[1:00:32] yes the woman is the weaker vessel yes
[1:00:35] that's what it says
[1:00:39] but the bible says that god said to
[1:00:42] himself
[1:00:45] it is not good that man be alone
[1:00:50] so then he went and he made a health
[1:00:52] meet for him entonces
[1:00:56] so yes
[1:00:57] you know we say the woman is the weaker
[1:00:59] vessel
[1:01:03] but it's the man that needs the help
[1:01:08] the woman was created to help the man
[1:01:13] because whatever he has to do in his
[1:01:16] ministry in his life and his work
[1:01:22] it's the wife the mother that is going
[1:01:24] to help out
[1:01:28] and strengthen him and do whatever she
[1:01:30] can to to
[1:01:32] allow him to fulfill his duties
[1:01:44] it was the woman that is made to be the
[1:01:46] glue of the family
[1:01:51] so she could explain to the kids of the
[1:01:54] father and the father he could ex she
[1:01:56] could explain
[1:01:57] the father to the kids
[1:02:04] no matter what i you know
[1:02:06] me myself and as as a father your
[1:02:09] personal mentor
[1:02:11] um when my kids see me coming from work
[1:02:17] they're so happy to see me is
[1:02:20] they're ready to play with me and and
[1:02:22] have so much fun and we will play games
[1:02:24] or whatever it is
[1:02:29] and they don't want to play with mom
[1:02:30] because mom is just strictly business
[1:02:42] but let them one of them get sick hurt
[1:02:45] or something is wrong but
[1:02:50] and they go straight to the mom director
[1:02:53] they know who exactly who to go to
[1:02:58] because she is the one that ministers
[1:03:05] whenever the father's out she's there
[1:03:07] teaching them the words
[1:03:12] whenever
[1:03:13] she's around with her kids she's the one
[1:03:16] teaching them where how to live and how
[1:03:18] to go and how to act
[1:03:25] it's everything comes out from the woman
[1:03:40] the promise came out of her la promesa
[1:03:43] but every fall everything that we see
[1:03:46] came out of her the same
[1:03:48] today
[1:03:52] amen amen
[1:03:55] so it's
[1:03:56] such a a great calling that a woman has
[1:04:02] and and
[1:04:03] you know
[1:04:05] one day god's going to take the curses
[1:04:07] that was put on
[1:04:09] jun dia dios bakitar
[1:04:20] is trying to perversely take those
[1:04:22] curses off themselves
[1:04:41] they're trying to take away the curse of
[1:04:43] childbearing by aborting children
[1:04:49] they don't want to be mothers they don't
[1:04:51] want to be subject they they want to
[1:04:54] take away the curse themselves and you
[1:04:56] see the world doing that today
[1:05:04] but the only way that
[1:05:07] the
[1:05:08] byproduct will be taken away is by the
[1:05:11] full redemption of our lord jesus christ
[1:05:20] so the first thing he says is he says i
[1:05:22] will put enmity between
[1:05:24] you and the woman
[1:05:31] that's a direct attack to the woman is
[1:05:36] he said i will put enmity between you
[1:05:40] and the woman
[1:05:44] the woman who was the
[1:05:46] the
[1:05:46] weaker vessel that saint seduced shall
[1:05:49] be his demise
[1:05:56] it was going to be through a woman that
[1:05:58] he was going to be conquered
[1:06:03] and because of that there was going to
[1:06:04] be a fight or a war break
[1:06:11] because it was going to be through a
[1:06:12] mother
[1:06:15] there was going to be a seed that comes
[1:06:17] out from her
[1:06:18] that was going to ruin the devil
[1:06:25] and the second it says and i will put
[1:06:27] enmity between
[1:06:29] your seed and her seed
[1:06:43] that hostility it typifies
[1:06:46] that the woman's seed
[1:06:51] it's an unending conflict between
[1:06:55] humanity and the forces of evil is a
[1:06:57] conflict
[1:07:25] see where that fight starts
[1:07:30] throughout your life you're gonna you're
[1:07:32] gonna fight as a christian you're gonna
[1:07:34] fight because you are predestinated seed
[1:07:36] of
[1:07:40] god you're going to go through a fight
[1:07:43] every single day
[1:07:46] but where did he say the fight was going
[1:07:48] to start
[1:07:51] the woman
[1:07:55] and i started to think to myself
[1:07:58] how how is it going to be through the
[1:08:00] woman in her seat
[1:08:03] we know that this is prophesying of
[1:08:05] jesus christ
[1:08:09] but it's prophesying of every mother
[1:08:11] also
[1:08:15] because good and evil comes out of her
[1:08:17] pocket
[1:08:19] it depends on how she raises the seed it
[1:08:22] depends
[1:08:42] and he will attack the mother and he
[1:08:44] will attack the family he'll attack the
[1:08:47] household
[1:08:49] carla familiar
[1:08:51] because we are the royal seat of abraham
[1:08:56] singular
[1:08:58] jesus was that seed jesus
[1:09:02] but then he went and he died on that
[1:09:04] cross
[1:09:07] he raised the third day and he spread
[1:09:10] the holy ghost everywhere
[1:09:16] now every person that has the holy ghost
[1:09:18] is the seed of the woman
[1:09:23] and every godly mother that raises that
[1:09:25] seed
[1:09:29] is going to be attacked
[1:09:31] because the devil knows
[1:09:44] that's where his end is
[1:09:58] he attacked
[1:09:59] um
[1:10:14] but god made another way
[1:10:17] in noah's time
[1:10:20] the bible says that the sons of god saw
[1:10:22] that the daughters of man were fair
[1:10:28] the devil said if i could mix my seed
[1:10:31] with their seeds
[1:10:35] i can ruin the seed
[1:10:39] but then the the humanity became so evil
[1:10:42] at that time
[1:10:46] to where god says i'm going to have to
[1:10:48] destroy the earth
[1:10:51] and the bible says that only eight souls
[1:10:54] were saved
[1:10:58] because of the sea trying to be
[1:11:02] tooken out
[1:11:06] and you see it throughout the ages you
[1:11:08] see that with moses
[1:11:12] you see how the devil tried to ruin the
[1:11:14] plan of god
[1:11:19] and the pharaoh said let's kill every
[1:11:21] child
[1:11:27] there was one mother that that
[1:11:30] loved her child so much that said you
[1:11:32] know what i'm going to find a way to
[1:11:34] save him
[1:11:39] and by faith
[1:11:41] she put that child in a river of
[1:11:44] crocodiles
[1:11:47] showing it was a shadow of what mary was
[1:11:50] going to do
[1:11:53] that she was going to have to put her
[1:11:55] child through danger
[1:11:59] she was going to have to put her into
[1:12:00] the river of death so that he could
[1:12:02] redeem the people
[1:12:05] of
[1:12:08] and we can go on and on and on how satan
[1:12:12] tried to
[1:12:13] kill the seed
[1:12:18] the very book of esther showing that
[1:12:20] haman tried to to annihilate all of the
[1:12:23] jews
[1:12:27] but there was a woman standing for her
[1:12:29] people
[1:12:33] and there we see jesus and herod try to
[1:12:37] do the same
[1:12:41] throughout the years they tried to
[1:12:43] protect that seed
[1:12:47] but mary was the last one to preserve
[1:12:49] that seeds
[1:12:54] that was the last
[1:12:56] stage right there there finally the seed
[1:12:59] that was promised was there jesus christ
[1:13:08] you know there's two things that
[1:13:10] um
[1:13:12] i notice about mary aidos
[1:13:16] that the catholic church praises her too
[1:13:18] much and makes her a god
[1:13:20] catholic
[1:13:25] and the christian church sometimes
[1:13:27] discards her too much to the point where
[1:13:30] we speak high more highly
[1:13:32] of of rahab than we do of her
[1:13:35] crisis
[1:13:43] she was a borrowed woman
[1:13:58] perfect it doesn't matter if that wasn't
[1:14:02] your child or not you bore him no
[1:14:04] importance
[1:14:07] and the love of a mother was there for
[1:14:09] him
[1:14:12] and the bible says that that strange
[1:14:15] things begin to happen in her life
[1:14:21] angels came down ankels
[1:14:24] singing
[1:14:26] gabriel came down and spoke to to joseph
[1:14:29] in a dream gabriel
[1:14:32] jose and the bible says all these things
[1:14:35] she kept in her heart
[1:14:39] realizing that this sun this seed was
[1:14:42] somebody special
[1:14:46] especially she was only 14 years old
[1:14:52] but her faith she accepted that seed
[1:15:15] and he said oh my eyes have seen my
[1:15:18] salvation now i can depart in peace
[1:15:26] [Applause]
[1:16:03] you know god told abraham to take his
[1:16:05] son up to the mountain
[1:16:10] this is for the fathers out there
[1:16:13] god told him to take his son to go
[1:16:15] sacrifice
[1:16:23] the turbulence in his heart
[1:16:28] imagine what he was thinking
[1:16:31] brother brown said that he believed that
[1:16:33] god would raise him up again
[1:16:39] but he knew he was going to have to
[1:16:40] sacrifice him
[1:16:44] and for three days entonces
[1:16:46] diaz
[1:17:00] imagine
[1:17:01] the pain
[1:17:04] the chosen seed that god promised me
[1:17:09] that all these years god promised him he
[1:17:12] was going to receive a seed
[1:18:09] it was 33 years
[1:18:12] 33 years she knew in her heart
[1:18:18] that her son was going to be sacrificed
[1:18:22] that her son was going to be giving up
[1:18:24] question
[1:18:52] yeah she probably was with a roman
[1:18:54] soldier soldier or something
[1:19:00] oh look at they say he's the promised
[1:19:02] son look at he they say he was virgin
[1:19:04] born mirello this is
[1:19:25] knowing she was walking up the same
[1:19:27] mountain to sacrifice her child
[1:19:33] raising him
[1:19:35] to let him go
[1:19:37] brother branham said she was a borrowed
[1:19:39] woman
[1:19:42] i can i i think we could all testify
[1:19:47] that all of our children are borrowed to
[1:19:49] us
[1:19:52] and we're taking them up
[1:19:55] so that we can let them go
[1:19:58] we're raising them so that we can let
[1:20:00] them go and see their life and do what
[1:20:02] they want
[1:20:11] because we see them we see them fall we
[1:20:13] see them sin we see them rebel porque
[1:20:15] vemos como esta
[1:20:28] or maybe 20 or 30 whenever they leave
[1:20:31] the house
[1:20:34] 40 50. who knows
[1:20:38] but that'll be
[1:20:39] the piercing of your soul
[1:20:43] that'll be your calvary
[1:20:46] saying you have to let them go
[1:20:50] and trust that everything that you did
[1:20:55] everything all the prayers that you made
[1:21:14] but now i am letting them go father
[1:21:19] i wonder if some people might say
[1:21:24] well that would be nice
[1:21:39] don't take out the trash
[1:21:42] i wish i had a jesus
[1:21:45] jesus
[1:21:46] if there was a woman that suffered more
[1:21:48] then it was mary
[1:21:52] maria she he was the perfect one
[1:21:56] yet a sword had to pierce your soul
[1:22:01] because of the reproach that they had to
[1:22:03] follow
[1:22:07] sometimes mothers have to carry the
[1:22:09] reproach of their children
[1:22:14] but as a mother they carry it gladly
[1:22:19] because that's their child
[1:22:22] and that that's the ones that they
[1:22:24] prayed for yo
[1:22:27] and no matter what anybody says that's
[1:22:29] their child and they'll hold them dearly
[1:22:35] lost
[1:22:45] a mother has such a great
[1:22:48] ministry
[1:22:51] abraham
[1:22:53] lincoln once said abraham lincoln
[1:22:56] well brother branham said this
[1:23:00] he said that abraham didn't have
[1:23:01] anything going for him this is
[1:23:07] george washington he was a smart man he
[1:23:10] said george washington
[1:23:12] he he went to school el sifue al escuela
[1:23:15] abraham lincoln abraham lincoln he was
[1:23:18] poor el era
[1:23:32] he became one of the greatest presidents
[1:23:34] in history
[1:23:38] and he said if i could
[1:23:40] say anything
[1:23:43] the reason i'm here
[1:23:46] the
[1:24:08] he was able to be one of the greatest
[1:24:11] presidents that was ever to live
[1:24:28] how
[1:24:29] at 38 years old
[1:24:32] brother branham says she already had
[1:24:34] white hair this element
[1:24:38] because of the ministry that she had to
[1:24:41] help
[1:24:42] the vidal minister okay
[1:24:50] you see the great mighty things that god
[1:24:54] did through him
[1:24:58] there was a godly wife a godly mother
[1:25:00] taking care of the children of you
[1:25:02] backing them up
[1:25:07] to the point where she was white-headed
[1:25:16] so that means that when her son passed
[1:25:19] away
[1:25:23] she was about around 48
[1:25:25] years old
[1:25:27] and i think to myself i wonder how old
[1:25:30] she must have looked
[1:25:31] pregnant
[1:25:34] the burden that she had for her son
[1:25:51] yet he was god himself
[1:25:56] and she was that chosen
[1:26:00] but when he died and he rose again
[1:26:03] he gave each and every one of us the
[1:26:05] holy ghost
[1:26:13] [Music]
[1:26:18] but god doesn't see you like castillo
[1:26:19] anymore
[1:26:32] god sees jesus christ
[1:27:30] amen so we want to honor
[1:27:34] the mothers
[1:27:38] because your ministry is the greatest
[1:27:41] minister
[1:27:43] behind every great man
[1:27:47] is a great wife
[1:27:50] but it was a mother that raised him
[1:27:55] john wesley because of his mother juan
[1:27:57] wesley
[1:28:12] to give small little testimonies
[1:28:17] of how their mothers impacted them in
[1:28:19] their lives
[1:28:22] if brother johnny would like to come up
[1:28:25] with
[1:29:05] i want to wish every single mother a
[1:29:06] happy mother's day
[1:29:10] in the name of the lord jesus christ

[1:29:15] way to honor your mother

[1:29:31] here of my mother for many many years
[1:29:42] i remember her
[1:29:44] changing me like like like she was my
[1:29:46] mother
[1:29:50] i love that sister
[1:29:54] um i'm just going to read a a
[1:29:57] a scripture
[1:30:01] it's in proverbs 31 25-28 in proverbial
[1:30:14] and she shall rejoice in time to come
[1:30:19] she openeth her mouth with wisdom
[1:30:24] and her and her tongue is the law of
[1:30:26] kindness
[1:30:30] she looketh well to the ways of her
[1:30:32] household
[1:30:44] her children arise up
[1:30:59] they asked they asked me to speak a few
[1:31:01] minutes only
[1:31:04] just a little testimony of uh
[1:31:07] who my mother is
[1:31:10] my mother and i see her in this
[1:31:12] scripture
[1:31:26] that that's the closest to god that we
[1:31:28] have here on earth

[1:36:38] and thou shall write them upon the post
[1:36:40] of thy house and on thy gates amen
[1:36:45] that scripture reminds me of my mother
[1:36:49] ever since i was very little simple
[1:36:54] i was always
[1:36:55] instructed and taught in the scriptures
[1:36:58] maybe i didn't understand them
[1:37:01] but on every birthday
[1:37:03] cantar las magnanitas
[1:37:17] the scripture of philippians 4 13.
[1:37:22] which says i can do all things in christ
[1:37:24] which strengthens me
[1:37:27] and those teachings they have followed
[1:37:29] me even on to today
[1:37:54] and i would see how the hands when they
[1:37:55] would have their little chicks
[1:38:00] it didn't matter what animal or dog
[1:38:01] would ever get close
[1:38:07] it didn't even matter the size of the
[1:38:08] animal that would attack the hen
[1:38:12] that hand would go crazy just to protect
[1:38:14] its little offspring
[1:38:16] yes
[1:38:18] and that's what my mother is for me
[1:38:23] uh there was one time that it was uh
[1:38:24] there was a house that was burning on
[1:38:26] fire
[1:38:28] and there was a little boy that was
[1:38:30] locked inside
[1:38:31] he was afraid
[1:38:33] and fearful
[1:38:35] you know
[1:38:37] and a mother went into to save him
[1:38:43] she was able to turn off the fire
[1:38:47] she did leave without any eyebrows
[1:38:50] and then the head the hair on her
[1:38:52] forehead was burnt off yes
[1:38:54] and that little boy was me
[1:38:56] like
[1:39:06] and i appreciate all of our teachings
[1:39:10] we know that the prophet of this age
[1:39:13] branham our prophet william branham
[1:39:18] el quinto evangelion he teaches us that
[1:39:20] the moms are the fifth gospels
[1:39:25] they're the ones that teach and instruct
[1:39:27] their children at home yes
[1:39:29] and they make the family altar
