[49:31] brother
[49:32] my brother was speaking on friday
[49:39] when i was interpreting for him up here
[49:44] he started speaking about what a
[49:46] blessing jericho has been for us
[49:51] and how privileged we are to be here
[49:56] and what god has done with these people
[50:00] and he started talking about the love
[50:03] that we have for one another
[50:07] and and being that i was interpreting
[50:09] him
[50:14] [Music]
[50:36] [Music]
[50:38] for all my brothers and sisters as a
[50:41] family
[50:43] here
[50:44] because we're a great family he said
[50:47] grand family
[50:48] said lord i ask that you can keep us all
[50:51] united
[50:56] i feel like that was perfectly what our
[50:58] pastor was telling us on friday
[51:04] love that we should have for one another
[51:28] and we pray that god fills us with more
[51:29] of his love this morning uh as i have
[51:31] you standing
[51:32] [Music]
[51:34] uh we're gonna be turning our scriptures
[51:38] to genesis chapter 22.
[51:42] we're going to be reading verse 17.
[51:47] and then from there we'll be turning to
[51:49] galatians chapter 3.
[51:53] i want to thank the pastor in the
[51:55] ministry for the opportunity to be here
[51:57] again
[51:58] [Music]
[52:01] and thank all of the musicians and
[52:03] everyone that participated in the
[52:04] service
[52:09] and to thank each and every one of you
[52:11] for bringing your part of the revival
[52:13] this morning
[52:16] is and let us not forget to keep our
[52:19] pastor in prayer as he returns back from
[52:21] mexico today
[52:27] along with those brothers that accompany
[52:32] genesis 22 17 reads genesis
[52:37] that in blessings i will bless thee and
[52:40] in multiplying i will multiply thy seed
[52:43] as the stars of the heaven and as the
[52:46] sand which is upon the seashore and thy
[52:48] seed shall possess the gate of his
[52:50] enemies
[53:03] galatians 3 16.
[53:09] now to abraham and his seed were the
[53:11] promises made
[53:13] he saith not and to seeds as of many but
[53:18] as of one and to thy seed which is
[53:21] christ
[53:35] god bless you brother ricardo okay i
[53:37] just i just saw you that's really good
[53:38] to see you brother
[53:39] ricardo
[53:48] we thank you lord jesus for another day
[53:50] of life you grant us jesus
[53:59] and hear a little more of your word
[54:03] to hear those supernatural confirmations
[54:05] that you give us
[54:08] confirmations
[54:15] keep that revival ever stirring inside
[54:18] of us
[54:22] and lord may we continue to love one
[54:24] another without agape love
[54:30] we put this service in your hands
[54:34] i put myself in your hands
[54:36] no main
[54:49] amen amen you may be seated brothers uh
[54:55] if i can give a little title to this
[54:56] small talk this morning
[55:02] i'd like to title it seed of abraham
[55:07] the seed of abraham
[55:10] and as we just read in genesis
[55:14] the blessing that god said was going to
[55:17] be upon abraham
[55:35] and then with a little more revelation
[55:36] in the book of galatians
[55:41] uh we hear here how the seed was not a
[55:44] seed as in many like it says
[55:55] and if you'd like to turn in first
[55:56] corinthians chapter 12.
[56:00] or you can just read it there on the
[56:01] screen
[56:04] uh just to give a little more light to
[56:05] it
[56:08] that seed that christ
[56:12] that multi-member body that we are is
[56:26] all the members of that one body
[56:38] and then verse 13 says for by one spirit
[56:41] are we all baptized into one body
[56:48] so we're still one body we're still one
[56:50] seed
[56:54] you jump down to verse 27.
[57:10] each and every one of you are an
[57:11] individual piece or an individual member
[57:13] of that body
[57:16] individual
[57:18] so now we understand that
[57:21] it wasn't plural multiple seeds
[57:38] but the bible says a singular seed just
[57:40] one
[57:42] the true seed
[57:45] that seed of the promise
[57:48] of the birthright of the blessings
[57:52] which was isaac
[57:54] the natural seed of abraham was that
[57:56] isaac
[58:00] but it was not the real seed or the
[58:01] royal seed
[58:05] and today we have many seeds out in the
[58:07] world
[58:11] especially in the christian or the
[58:12] religious realm especially
[58:17] those seeds begotten those begotten
[58:18] pentecostals
[58:29] but christians like what we have here
[58:31] this morning
[58:48] abraham
[58:51] and brother branham says it is that the
[58:54] isaac was just as substitutionary
[58:59] till christ came
[59:02] because jesus christ was the royal seat
[59:04] of abraham
[59:07] so now when god makes a promise
[59:11] we all know god's going to keep to his
[59:13] promises
[59:27] he has to make sure that we are worthy
[59:29] of that blessing
[59:59] well if abraham the father of faith had
[1:00:01] to be tried
[1:00:05] and we've got that dna in us
[1:00:09] and we've got those faith genes in us
[1:00:39] these trials or these tests in part
[1:00:42] these are for for others to see espera
[1:00:47] like that blind man
[1:00:50] when they were asking why was he blind
[1:00:53] when no one sinned
[1:00:56] jesus just wanted to manifest his glory
[1:00:58] jesus
[1:01:00] gloria your test your trial supremacy
[1:01:03] for someone in your family someone in
[1:01:05] your your community or in the church
[1:01:08] or
[1:01:10] to be able to see god's glory operate in
[1:01:13] your life foreign
[1:01:17] sometimes it's even deeper than that
[1:01:21] just like joe asico mohob it's strictly
[1:01:24] so that satan can see who you are
[1:01:29] didn't deserve of none of the things
[1:01:31] that happened to him
[1:01:34] but yet god gave him the green light to
[1:01:36] attack him
[1:01:40] yes job was going to grow in the face
[1:01:44] yes there was going to be family and
[1:01:46] friends that were going to see god's
[1:01:47] glory family
[1:01:50] amigos satan was going to see that job
[1:01:54] could do it all on his own
[1:01:59] because we always look at the story of
[1:02:01] job
[1:02:03] like god that just always blessed him
[1:02:05] with belongings
[1:02:08] but i like to look at it a little
[1:02:09] different
[1:02:12] different we're in job's tests and
[1:02:14] trials throughout his life
[1:02:18] god
[1:02:32] his complaints to god imparted
[1:02:36] not just saying you bless him with all
[1:02:37] these belongings and riches
[1:02:43] but every test and trial that you put
[1:02:44] him through but
[1:02:51] why don't you let me take a shot at him
[1:02:52] and leave him alone
[1:02:55] let's see if he can really still serve
[1:02:57] you
[1:03:00] so god took
[1:03:28] all
[1:03:38] and if we can just give praise to god
[1:03:56] hospital
[1:03:59] and she recently got released
[1:04:03] and in that text that he shared with
[1:04:04] everyone
[1:04:07] he was giving praise to god
[1:04:23] she wasn't healed at the hospital
[1:04:27] in the hospital she was healed that day
[1:04:28] on calvary
[1:04:31] he's not going to be healed at home
[1:04:34] because she was already healed that day
[1:04:36] on calvary
[1:04:51] but we recognize the tests are going to
[1:04:54] come recon
[1:04:56] and after the test
[1:04:58] is going to come the blessing
[1:05:01] that's why i like to identify with
[1:05:02] rebecca
[1:05:04] identification
[1:05:05] you know her test
[1:05:21] might not seem like too much he says
[1:05:24] but what if somebody came to you
[1:05:28] from africa with this message
[1:05:31] and he's a dark-skinned brother who
[1:05:33] we've never seen before
[1:06:16] i've
[1:06:24] so we're talking to a bunch of lunatics
[1:06:26] this morning
[1:06:28] and it's a test yes
[1:06:30] like
[1:06:40] the first step in anything ever almost
[1:06:41] everything you do in life requires faith
[1:06:47] the act to go to sleep requires faith to
[1:06:50] know you're going to wake up in the
[1:06:51] morning
[1:06:55] the act of walking to your car requires
[1:06:57] faith that is going to turn on
[1:07:12] i was rereading the story
[1:07:15] i believe it was her brothers or her
[1:07:16] uncles i'm not too sure
[1:07:20] that we're saying and please can you
[1:07:22] leave us with her for about 10 more days
[1:08:08] that this is what
[1:08:42] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:08:48] so to all the rebecca's here
[1:08:50] la la revenant
[1:09:04] what are you
[1:09:15] god has a really strange pattern of the
[1:09:17] way he does things
[1:09:22] it's very unique
[1:09:24] but at the same time it's perfect
[1:09:27] it's something that's just holy it's
[1:09:30] santo you know we can't pinpoint just so
[1:09:32] we think we've got it figured out
[1:09:38] it's in some kind of way that we least
[1:09:39] imagine
[1:09:43] you know like my dad always says
[1:09:46] he had a million different ways figured
[1:09:48] out how i would come to the feet of
[1:09:50] jesus
[1:09:55] never would he would have thought that i
[1:09:57] came the way that i came
[1:10:00] in never would have thought that my
[1:10:03] girlfriend would be the genuine believer
[1:10:04] and i'd be the hypocrite
[1:10:10] because we can't figure out god
[1:10:14] the perfect plan and we've just got to
[1:10:16] accept it
[1:10:20] and that's the same way it is with the
[1:10:22] tests he puts on our lives
[1:10:26] it's not for our punishment
[1:10:28] it wasn't for the punishment of job
[1:10:32] the punishment the tests weren't for the
[1:10:34] punishment of abraham
[1:10:38] but it was for an edification and a
[1:10:39] maturity
[1:10:42] if you look at joseph in the bible
[1:10:46] he was a special child nino special he
[1:10:48] was a blessed child
[1:10:51] we could say i don't even know how to
[1:10:53] say in english
[1:10:55] he was spoiled by his uh uh in english
[1:10:58] he was bored by his father a special
[1:10:59] place in his heart for that joseph
[1:11:04] yet he was hated by his brothers
[1:11:08] sold out into slavery
[1:11:10] he was
[1:11:15] it was like he couldn't get a break in
[1:11:17] life
[1:11:20] just kept falling down this never-ending
[1:11:22] pit of problems
[1:11:35] but every single one of those tests was
[1:11:37] for a purpose
[1:11:41] because there was a blessing to come
[1:11:43] from those tests
[1:11:47] because joseph too was a seed of abraham
[1:11:52] and god follows the same pattern
[1:11:56] patron the blessing was going to be uh
[1:12:00] that one day he was going to interpret
[1:12:02] some very important dreams
[1:12:06] one day he was going to be promoted to
[1:12:08] the highest in egypt
[1:12:12] one day he would save his family and his
[1:12:14] brothers
[1:12:17] one day he would be given the land of
[1:12:19] goshen for an entire nation
[1:12:25] where his family could live and be at
[1:12:27] peace
[1:12:30] in the message the oddball
[1:12:33] appreciate 1964.
[1:12:37] brother branham says the following
[1:12:40] and to come and to come here this
[1:12:42] morning and look
[1:12:45] this little fine this fine little
[1:12:47] jerusalem setting out here
[1:13:02] audience
[1:13:05] and was referring to how they had come
[1:13:06] and it was like a goshen where they were
[1:13:08] at
[1:13:11] benidorm
[1:13:14] says remember
[1:13:17] goshen was one of the places that they
[1:13:19] worshipped
[1:13:22] one of the first places that the tent
[1:13:24] was pitched
[1:13:28] and to me old friends and the new and to
[1:13:30] have all this time allotted to us
[1:13:37] it just seems like that
[1:13:39] that you just don't want to leave
[1:13:43] but brother branham here is comparing
[1:13:45] aqui element
[1:13:47] like being in goshen
[1:13:50] to being in church
[1:13:52] you read it clearly how he's saying it's
[1:13:54] like a tent that's pitched
[1:14:13] meet all the new friends like we've met
[1:14:15] here in church
[1:14:19] so the land of goshen
[1:14:22] was like a physical church today
[1:14:26] and
[1:14:39] a place of security for for themselves
[1:14:43] like brother brown says a place where
[1:14:45] they can worship
[1:14:46] this
[1:14:49] but the believer today
[1:14:52] in the midst of the egypt and the world
[1:14:53] that we live in today and
[1:15:04] we've been blessed like we heard friday
[1:15:06] if we have our own jericho tabernacles
[1:15:20] but the physical church it has its place
[1:15:23] and it's respect in the world
[1:15:28] and it also has its limitations
[1:15:32] you know if you think of the the
[1:15:33] physical church any church just
[1:15:35] like physical iglesia you know it's it's
[1:15:38] somewhat of a safe place
[1:15:41] it's a place that's respected
[1:15:44] from believers non-believers almost
[1:15:46] anybody respects the church when they
[1:15:48] see it on the streets incredible
[1:15:53] you know maybe we could say 99 times out
[1:15:55] of 100.
[1:15:58] you're safer in church
[1:16:02] than being at a sports game
[1:16:31] made its way into our church
[1:16:35] you didn't wait at the door in
[1:16:37] the puerto rico it wasn't standing there
[1:16:38] on the on the street there on rosier
[1:16:42] it came in and struck many of us and
[1:16:43] even killed some of us
[1:16:59] you know in goshen the israelites they
[1:17:01] were protected from the plagues
[1:17:06] like we saw in the children's play that
[1:17:07] we had
[1:17:10] you know when when when the frogs came
[1:17:13] upon the land
[1:17:18] when the darkness made its way upon
[1:17:20] egypt
[1:17:23] there was light in goshen
[1:17:26] there was a safe place in goshen avion
[1:17:28] lugar
[1:17:43] that death angel was going to travel in
[1:17:45] egypt
[1:17:48] and it was also going to make its way
[1:17:50] into goshens
[1:17:53] that's why goshen and the church are
[1:17:55] like
[1:18:08] cutting hair when i talk to people over
[1:18:10] and over
[1:18:23] people are so comfortable and quick and
[1:18:25] easy to say well i go to church
[1:18:31] oh i'm good oh you see
[1:18:32] they've got a more security in their
[1:18:34] face than we do
[1:18:38] how many times have you been in service
[1:18:40] quantas basis
[1:18:42] the minister says
[1:18:45] how many have the holy ghost
[1:18:51] right
[1:18:53] but they have such a conviction that
[1:18:55] from going to church they're safe
[1:19:02] i pay my tithes i go to church i'm saved
[1:19:06] i'm one of the ushers and i seat the
[1:19:07] people i'm saying
[1:19:11] i play an instrument i go to church i'm
[1:19:12] saved
[1:19:15] i'm a minister at jericho tabernacle i'm
[1:19:17] saved
[1:19:20] it doesn't
[1:19:39] i've been born and raised in goshen or
[1:19:42] born and raised in the church so i'm
[1:19:43] saved
[1:19:48] praying in goshen and fellowshipping in
[1:19:50] goshen and living in goshen is not going
[1:19:52] to save you horrando
[1:19:56] it wasn't going to save the israelites
[1:20:00] gonna save us
[1:20:02] going
[1:20:16] because the church
[1:20:44] and the tokens been placed on it
[1:20:47] nothing can breach that boxcar
[1:20:51] break that seal
[1:20:53] it's sealed all the way to its
[1:20:55] destination
[1:20:58] cannot
[1:21:13] church is a blessing
[1:21:15] jericho tabernacle is a blessing
[1:21:19] to the believers watching online your
[1:21:20] church is a blessing
[1:21:25] but that is not the promised land
[1:21:28] like we said we heard how much of a
[1:21:30] blessing this church is for us on friday
[1:21:37] but it's just the church
[1:21:40] it's not the holy spirit
[1:21:42] it is not the token
[1:21:44] we more than anyone should know there's
[1:21:46] more work to be done
[1:21:52] we need to be born again
[1:22:22] you know brother branham says moses
[1:22:24] needed pallbearers
[1:22:29] so god provided angels
[1:22:33] says enoch needed a ladder this is
[1:22:47] so god provided him with the jawbone
[1:22:57] so god provided you jesus christ the
[1:23:00] ultimate sacrifice
[1:23:09] needed power ocupaba el poder so god
[1:23:13] provided the holy ghost
[1:23:17] you know after the days of elijah
[1:23:19] despues
[1:23:20] and the days of the prophets
[1:23:23] and those miracles and wonders and great
[1:23:25] things that would happen
[1:23:29] you know the church hadn't seen miracles
[1:23:31] for many many years
[1:23:46] and you know if we're not careful
[1:23:49] and god terries
[1:23:51] you know those that lived with brother
[1:23:53] branham are dead
[1:23:57] those that were children and were at
[1:23:58] brother brown's meetings they're dead
[1:24:00] lost
[1:24:04] those that were under the ministries of
[1:24:05] those that were children are starting to
[1:24:07] die
[1:24:12] and pretty soon we're going to die
[1:25:06] [Music]
[1:25:07] it was too much life for them
[1:25:11] i could think jesus i think of jesus
[1:25:12] walking around
[1:25:14] jesus
[1:25:15] you know what's wrong with these people
[1:25:19] aren't these not the believers
[1:25:21] isn't this the church of god that they
[1:25:23] claim to be keno esto
[1:25:38] but even then it was too much life for
[1:25:40] them
[1:25:44] for them
[1:25:47] there was too much revelation in the
[1:25:48] times of a brother
[1:25:52] we are the
[1:26:34] and the church they accepted those gifts
[1:26:38] they embraced those gifts
[1:26:41] they knew that it came down from god
[1:26:45] but they made a mistake
[1:26:47] they idolized those gifts
[1:26:50] they made those gifts bigger than the
[1:26:52] gift giver asian quesos
[1:26:56] they accepted the gifts
[1:26:58] but they rejected the gift giver bro
[1:27:02] they
[1:27:17] why do we let satan continue to push us
[1:27:18] around in our lives
[1:27:23] every little thing that happens he's
[1:27:24] always belittling us
[1:27:29] you know it's like every moment he gets
[1:27:30] he just says boo and we jump
[1:27:36] we better accept the protection that
[1:27:38] he's given us in his words
[1:27:43] i've read this scripture who knows how
[1:27:44] many
[1:28:10] to have a millstone hanged around his
[1:28:25] to me that is
[1:28:35] to think someone has enough power to say
[1:28:38] that kind of a statement
[1:28:40] exists
[1:29:34] legions begged for mercy at the feet of
[1:29:36] jesus
[1:29:50] but we've got to be sure that jesus is
[1:29:52] actually on your side
[1:29:57] because jesus is only here to protect
[1:29:59] his seed
[1:30:04] like we read in genesis como limos in
[1:30:06] genesis then we read in galatians
[1:30:09] and then we read in corinthians
[1:30:12] christ's seed
[1:30:14] he's only here to protect his seeds
[1:30:18] the bible says that jesus came to the
[1:30:21] world
[1:30:23] not to condemn the world but to save the
[1:30:25] world
[1:30:28] so i i i can see there that there was an
[1:30:30] equal opportunity for everybody
[1:30:46] but i thought you came to save the whole
[1:30:48] world
[1:30:51] i did easy but all you had to do was
[1:30:54] accept me
[1:30:57] he knew those that would accept him
[1:31:01] because not everyone would accept him
[1:31:04] only the seed of abraham was going to be
[1:31:06] the one to accept it
[1:31:10] maybe there's people here this morning
[1:31:13] they might be mumbling under their
[1:31:15] breath
[1:31:17] there might be saying in their mind or
[1:31:19] their heart
[1:31:21] i know jesus
[1:31:23] jesus i accepted him
[1:31:26] well so did that man in the bible on
[1:31:27] that day of judgment
[1:31:31] when he said i know you lord pandodijo
[1:31:33] senor yo
[1:31:34] no i did this in your name lord senor
[1:31:36] simon
[1:31:38] i did that in your name
[1:31:40] no maybe you think oh that's not me you
[1:31:45] that sounds like a minister or a pastor
[1:31:47] or something like that
[1:31:51] you know that that's scripture
[1:31:54] it hits me so hard
[1:32:09] so when i read that scripture
[1:32:13] it's like a reality check for me
[1:32:18] no imagine it's imagining to be there
[1:32:21] that day
[1:32:23] oh yes lord i know you see senor yote
[1:32:25] conosco i preached a jericho tabernacle
[1:32:27] in your name
[1:32:30] i cast out demons in your name
[1:32:34] we prayed for the sick in your name
[1:32:37] for the lord to say depart from me i
[1:32:39] never knew you
[1:32:40] dig
[1:32:42] you're not royal sea
[1:32:45] real we've got to be sure
[1:32:49] we've got to have a real experience
[1:32:58] oh that we have the lord jesus christ
[1:33:00] living in our hearts
[1:33:05] know that we are that seed of abraham
[1:33:10] if you think about the philistines
[1:33:17] i don't think any single one of them
[1:33:19] were even the slightest bit scared no
[1:33:22] questions
[1:33:25] they walked tall and walked proud with
[1:33:27] all of their their their weapons and
[1:33:29] everything
[1:33:33] they were fearless
[1:33:49] just seek goliath on the enemy
[1:33:54] but how much more should we stand tall
[1:33:59] how much more should we be fearless
[1:34:03] we've got jesus christ on our side
[1:34:07] that big old giant with all those
[1:34:09] muscles
[1:34:12] was killed by a tiny little stone
[1:34:16] the jesus christ that we serve and love
[1:34:18] el jesus christ
[1:34:20] he overcame death
[1:34:23] he didn't need that stature of those
[1:34:24] muscles
[1:34:27] bible says there was no beauty in him
[1:35:14] you put your mirror up right now
[1:35:17] why have you lost the battles
[1:35:20] why have you been defeated
[1:35:23] is it a lack of spiritual training
[1:35:26] spiritual lack of spiritual food in your
[1:35:28] life
[1:35:31] is it that you have a laziness of
[1:35:32] getting in your words
[1:35:36] because you have a lazy prayer life
[1:35:41] i'm not talking to anyone in particular
[1:35:42] i'm talking to myself
[1:35:44] in particular
[1:35:46] that's why i said put up your own mirror
[1:35:47] and ask your own questions
[1:35:52] maybe there's someone in here right now
[1:35:53] kisas
[1:36:00] you haven't been precocious and you let
[1:36:02] sin enter into your marriage
[1:36:08] you've allowed your wife to start doing
[1:36:09] these things
[1:36:12] allowed your husband to start doing
[1:36:13] these things
[1:36:16] allowed your children to start doing
[1:36:18] these things
[1:36:21] you in the privacy of your bedroom
[1:36:25] your cars
[1:36:26] your jobs your homes
[1:36:29] have allowed sin to enter into your own
[1:36:31] heart
[1:36:34] and then we ask ourselves why am i
[1:36:36] defeated and why
[1:36:50] to say you know it's okay man
[1:36:55] i've got this one you mean
[1:36:57] just stay back i'll take care of it
[1:37:00] but then sometimes god's going to fight
[1:37:01] with you
[1:37:04] he's going to say okay
[1:37:31] because you're going to have to fight
[1:37:33] all alone
[1:37:36] solo the bible says be still
[1:37:40] know that i am god
[1:37:42] be still son i'm going to fight for you
[1:37:47] just stay there and resist the devil
[1:37:49] i'll go take care of it in the
[1:37:50] background
[1:37:54] oh but then there are times like
[1:37:55] shadrach meshach and abednego
[1:38:00] where they
[1:38:13] so they were sent to the furnace to die
[1:38:17] but god stepped on the scene
[1:38:21] don't worry son you're not doing this
[1:38:22] alone
[1:38:24] we're going to fight this one out
[1:38:25] together
[1:38:27] we're going to show them who the living
[1:38:29] god is together
[1:38:32] but then you have jacob
[1:38:36] you know i i'm so fond of job in the
[1:38:38] bible
[1:38:42] ultimate
[1:38:56] who was all alone
[1:38:59] who was scared yes
[1:39:01] he was desperate yesterday
[1:39:03] with no one else around him
[1:39:06] he didn't have any help
[1:39:08] he didn't have anyone to back him up
[1:39:12] but there he was when he saw that angel
[1:39:14] bro
[1:39:17] and he had to fight all alone
[1:39:20] he wasn't given any supernatural powers
[1:39:23] to win
[1:39:37] this is one of those battles like
[1:39:38] brother branham says
[1:39:40] matthias de la cual mentioned a bride
[1:39:42] night prayer service
[1:39:45] pray until the morning till you receive
[1:39:47] that holy ghost
[1:39:51] all night long until he got his
[1:39:53] blessings
[1:39:57] but he fought it all alone
[1:40:01] and i want to encourage you
[1:40:04] to every one of you
[1:40:06] says
[1:40:20] one
[1:40:32] that's what he's talking about a seat of
[1:40:34] abraham established
[1:40:36] the bride of jesus christ
[1:40:38] we should be full of joy and confidence
[1:40:40] then
[1:40:43] knowing who we are
[1:40:46] what is that power and authority that
[1:40:47] backs us up
[1:41:14] then can you imagine the power and
[1:41:15] authority that a church of the living
[1:41:17] god could have already said
[1:41:22] if it was full of christians that were
[1:41:23] living right
[1:41:27] full of christians that were all prayed
[1:41:29] up yeah
[1:41:36] you know i think then is when the
[1:41:38] scripture could be fulfilled
[1:41:42] if god before us
[1:41:44] then who can be against us
[1:41:47] we're going to be closing soon
[1:41:51] i was reading on elijah yeah
[1:41:54] and and and there was an occasion
[1:41:58] where there was a servant
[1:42:00] who was a little a little nervous a
[1:42:02] little scared
[1:42:05] and elijah pulled him aside
[1:42:08] you know maybe he was scared from a
[1:42:10] battle
[1:42:12] battalion
[1:43:00] and start praying like elijah praying
[1:43:04] lord can you open the eyes of my brother
[1:43:08] can you open the eyes of my sister
[1:43:11] let them see what they have behind them
[1:43:19] say that be with us
[1:43:22] or more than
[1:43:34] [Applause]
[1:43:50] we're going to be closing
[1:43:52] the terminal i have just three more
[1:43:54] quotes
[1:43:56] maybe a bit of a turn of the corner
[1:44:02] in the message
[1:44:03] christ is identified in the same in all
[1:44:06] generations
[1:44:11] thank you brothers for putting up top
[1:44:14] nero
[1:44:15] it says
[1:44:17] and please follow along for precedence
[1:44:32] and now the revival fires are quieting
[1:44:35] down
[1:44:38] the enthusiasm in the people is dying
[1:44:41] off enthusiasm
[1:44:44] and you can see it
[1:44:46] brother
[1:45:00] and that caused the people to go home
[1:45:04] a couple of days ago
[1:45:07] sister sarah sent a picture and a
[1:45:09] message
[1:45:13] to the ladies chat i'll uh
[1:45:18] and my wife couldn't be here this
[1:45:19] morning my children are sick
[1:45:23] and a lot of times when the message is
[1:45:25] short in that chat
[1:45:31] she's able to put it in the translator
[1:45:33] and and understand what it is when it's
[1:45:35] in spanish
[1:45:42] this occasion it was a little long so i
[1:45:43] was her translator
[1:45:48] what is this
[1:45:51] oh it was a picture of brother johnny
[1:45:53] here
[1:45:55] brothers is right behind them
[1:46:23] and i started thinking wow it's been
[1:46:25] three years
[1:46:28] so i had to go back in the calendar
[1:46:31] and yes it fell on that exact date three
[1:46:34] years ago
[1:46:38] and therefore that's why this quote
[1:46:40] stood out so much to me
[1:46:45] it says and we'll read it again
[1:46:48] usually a revival lasts about three
[1:46:51] years
[1:46:55] and now the revival fires are quieting
[1:46:57] down
[1:47:00] the enthusiasm of the people is dying
[1:47:03] off enthusiasm
[1:47:06] i think the most impactful part in this
[1:47:10] impact
[1:47:12] and you can see it
[1:47:16] the message possessing the enemy's gates
[1:47:20] puerto rico
[1:47:25] and explaining about moses after he had
[1:47:28] brought the people out of egypt
[1:47:33] and how they had just crossed the red
[1:47:35] sea
[1:47:37] and now they were on dry land on the
[1:47:39] other side all right
[1:47:42] brother branham says it is
[1:47:45] only a few years later when the trials
[1:47:48] come
[1:48:02] as it is so easy for a congregation of
[1:48:04] people to do when something just don't
[1:48:07] seem to happen the way it's supposed to
[1:48:08] be
[1:48:27] a certain person got put into office for
[1:48:30] this position
[1:48:33] a certain sister said this on one
[1:48:35] occasion
[1:48:38] and the church god shook up
[1:48:41] foreign
[1:48:46] it happened forgive me
[1:48:49] because it didn't
[1:48:50] it seemed to happen the way that it's
[1:48:52] supposed to be
[1:48:58] the church being shook up
[1:49:01] what brother branham says
[1:49:04] god makes it that way
[1:49:08] not the enemy
[1:49:10] not your brother
[1:49:11] not your sister
[1:49:13] god made it that way
[1:49:17] god brings tensions into the church
[1:49:23] tension you know what tension is
[1:49:25] extension it's like when you're walking
[1:49:27] on eggshells and everythi it's it's like
[1:49:29] a glass is about to break in the room
[1:49:35] and brother branham says edison amanda
[1:49:37] branham every son that cometh to god
[1:49:41] must be tried
[1:49:45] who
[1:49:46] can a son of god
[1:49:49] tried and proven and tested
[1:49:56] he lets sickness strike you
[1:50:00] he lets disease come upon you
[1:50:05] we spoke earlier about goshen yeah
[1:50:10] and the church
[1:50:11] and how it has its limits
[1:50:14] kovid came in here and killed many of us
[1:50:19] we are still people that are living
[1:50:21] survivors of covet right
[1:50:36] to show
[1:50:45] but to show the entire world
[1:50:49] what was the title
[1:50:51] that you are truly a seed of abraham
[1:50:57] he permits it because that's his will
[1:51:02] god's will
[1:51:04] disease
[1:51:33] you los amigos
[1:51:36] for brother r but
[1:51:38] to one day
[1:51:40] stab me in the back
[1:51:43] for one day brother
[1:51:46] to speak bad about me behind my back
[1:51:50] to to sell me
[1:51:53] my friend to turn against me
[1:51:58] let us keep reading
[1:51:59] but branham says
[1:52:01] he permits all those things
[1:52:07] and here i feel like it gets even more
[1:52:09] worse
[1:52:27] he says he turns the devil loose
[1:52:31] diablo i could think like a dog you just
[1:52:33] let him go
[1:52:37] he says to tempt you
[1:52:41] if you struggled with drugs he's not
[1:52:43] going to tempt you with drugs
[1:52:47] he used to struggle with women he don't
[1:52:49] care about tempting you with women
[1:52:54] with those things of the past
[1:52:58] you you just you just came out of egypt
[1:53:01] no they said no no
[1:53:03] you are seat of abraham
[1:53:05] you you you he's going to tempt you
[1:53:10] in a different way
[1:53:12] i i don't like how that brother preaches
[1:53:16] last time he said this this and this is
[1:53:19] yesterday you know what next time i'm
[1:53:21] just gonna watch service from the house
[1:53:28] you know what i got a better job uh i'm
[1:53:30] just gonna sacrifice fridays or
[1:53:32] wednesdays
[1:53:37] i'll watch it one day late la voyage
[1:53:52] but you're no longer in that security in
[1:53:54] goshen
[1:53:58] brother brahm says and he'll do all but
[1:54:01] take your life
[1:54:06] he could
[1:54:17] i can identify a hundred percent with
[1:54:19] what brother branham says here i
[1:54:33] the church against you que la iglesias
[1:54:36] contra
[1:54:37] can you imagine
[1:54:40] the seed of abraham la cemente de bram
[1:54:42] and the church turn against you
[1:54:46] brother branham says this is
[1:54:49] anything
[1:54:52] because it's god's will for him to do it
[1:54:58] please stan
[1:55:00] musicians
[1:55:02] forgive
[1:55:14] that it is more
[1:55:15] than more precious than gold to us
[1:55:21] all these things
[1:55:24] all these tests and trials
[1:55:27] they are precious gold for our character
[1:55:29] as christians
[1:55:43] maybe the butterflies are no longer in
[1:55:45] your stomach
[1:55:48] but there's still more work to do
[1:55:52] on this earth
[1:55:56] brother brown is sending the message
[1:55:57] possessing the enemy's gates this is
[1:56:01] forgive me christ identified is
[1:56:03] identified the same in all generations
[1:56:10] but when but we're trying to rebuild
[1:56:13] these fires again on every hill that we
[1:56:15] can say
[1:56:21] i cannot do it
[1:56:23] no minister canada
[1:56:26] it takes all of us
[1:56:29] the revival might be over he says
[1:56:32] it's going to take all of us
[1:56:36] brother brown says together
[1:56:40] our brother prayed
[1:56:52] it's going to take all of us
[1:57:08] will continue to bless his people
[1:57:13] as we await for his comments
[1:57:20] just because
[1:57:22] a revival is over
[1:57:26] doesn't mean the revival inside of you
[1:57:28] has to be over no significa
[1:57:33] you know when that man was out searching
[1:57:35] for the revival on those streets
[1:57:53] you are the revival
[1:57:56] you bring that revival every time you
[1:57:58] come to services
[1:58:02] you need to minister for a revival
[1:58:18] that holy
[1:58:46] but if you
[1:59:00] how we
[1:59:14] in the future
[1:59:17] because we know just like our father
