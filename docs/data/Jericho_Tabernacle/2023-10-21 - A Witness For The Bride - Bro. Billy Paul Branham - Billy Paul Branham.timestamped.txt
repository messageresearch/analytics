[0:04] and we've been married all several
[0:07] months after about a year Little Billy
[0:10] Paul come on the
[0:13] scene oh she almost
[0:16] died and how I walked up and down the
[0:19] floor when the little fellow was being
[0:22] born and just as soon as he was
[0:24] born I heard him cry and I scream I said
[0:27] Thank You Lord It's a boy and his name
[0:29] shall be call Billy
[0:32] Paul many of you know my son Billy Paul
[0:36] his mother died when he just a little
[0:38] baby and I packed him around and night
[0:42] time we couldn't afford enough coal to
[0:44] keep fire so I'd have put his bottle
[0:46] under my shoulders like this and keep it
[0:48] warm for him at night time when he wake
[0:50] up crying for his mother I'd put the
[0:52] bottle in his mouth
[0:55] and she asked me when she was dying
[0:58] always stick with Billy we've been real
[1:01] Chums and so everywhere I go I take
[1:06] Billy and he's stuck with
[1:08] [Music]
[1:11] me well like could take this opportunity
[1:14] to greet you I don't get this
[1:16] opportunity much anymore as you get a
[1:18] little older you can't do the things
[1:20] that you used to do you want to and in
[1:23] your heart but one thing I want you to
[1:25] know that I love you and I pray for you
[1:28] daily and I know that you pray for me
[1:31] because that's why I'm here today truly
[1:34] we're a blessed people and I just want
[1:36] to take an opportunity to say God bless
[1:39] you and over the many years that I have
[1:42] known you and have worked with you when
[1:45] Dad was here and now in the work with
[1:48] Brother Joseph and it's just an honor to
[1:51] call you my friend and you know there's
[1:54] words you can't say but I just trust
[1:56] that this little greeting will be a
[1:58] blessing to you just to say I love you
[2:00] and that you can feel it from your heart
[2:03] you know brother brand said we could we
[2:05] could talk too much we could sing too
[2:07] much we could shout too much but we
[2:09] could never pray too much and each day
[2:12] brother brandham told me he said when
[2:14] you come in the office Billy he said I
[2:16] want you to do my mail and I said Daddy
[2:18] I don't even know how to turn on the
[2:20] typewriter he says the Lord will be with
[2:22] you he said he told me he wanted you to
[2:24] do that for me and I said okay he said
[2:27] no matter if you've got one letter or
[2:30] you've got a thousand he said the first
[2:32] thing you do is kneel down and pray and
[2:34] lay your hands on the mail and ask the
[2:36] Lord to help you that day and he said
[2:39] don't you answer any Bible questions
[2:42] don't you answer for me he said if
[2:44] there's a question to me you keep them
[2:46] when we get together the next day or
[2:49] that day or whenever he says then you
[2:51] write down on the envelope and I'll
[2:53] answer the questions he said but no
[2:55] matter where I am he says you remember
[2:59] every day that you do the mail he said
[3:02] I'll be praying for you and he says and
[3:04] God will be there with you and he says
[3:06] don't process the mail he said just open
[3:09] one letter at a time and just think like
[3:12] you only have one letter to answer and
[3:15] he says and then when you through with
[3:16] that he says discard it and then get
[3:19] another one and that's what I've been
[3:21] doing for the last 60 years and it's
[3:24] been a great honor and I know I'm
[3:26] getting older now I'm not an old man but
[3:29] I know I'm getting up there and soon
[3:32] I've got to go and be what we've all
[3:35] been waiting for and I believe that R is
[3:37] so close at hand but I just want an
[3:39] opportunity to say I love you and I
[3:42] thank you for your love to me your stand
[3:45] for this word and you know brother Billy
[3:47] I'm just talking to you from my heart I
[3:50] believe this is a oneman message it's a
[3:53] perfect message there's no mistakes
[3:55] there's many voices but for me in my
[3:59] house we only follow one voice and
[4:02] that's the voice of God to us in this
[4:04] day it's perfect it needs no
[4:07] interpretation it interprets itself and
[4:10] I was thinking a couple of days now I'll
[4:13] be getting my 83rd birthday and in my
[4:17] heart and in my body I don't feel that
[4:19] old I know I look at the wife says I act
[4:22] like it no I shouldn't say that if it
[4:24] wasn't for her I I wouldn't even be here
[4:26] today but it's just the idea of of being
[4:29] being able to express yourself this
[4:32] message is everything to me it's perfect
[4:36] and may God encourage your heart to stay
[4:38] with it there's things we don't
[4:40] understand but remember if God thought
[4:43] it brother Brenham spoke it we believe
[4:46] it and that settles it and I was
[4:48] thinking the other day and I woke up and
[4:51] when I was just a little boy I was about
[4:53] 12 years old and we was over in a little
[4:56] town called vandelia Illinois and
[4:58] brother Brandon was having a tent
[5:01] meeting and we stayed in a little cheap
[5:04] hotel and I say that to go with my
[5:07] testimony here and I know you've
[5:08] probably heard me give this testimony
[5:11] but maybe just one more time I want to
[5:13] share it with you because it's one of
[5:15] the greatest experiences of my
[5:17] life and in this room it didn't even
[5:20] have a bathroom the bathroom was down
[5:23] the hall and we just had a war SPAC
[5:26] right where the camera is here and it
[5:28] was just a little war spacing in a
[5:30] little picture and that's where we'd
[5:31] wash our hands and things when we had to
[5:33] take a shower take a bath we go down at
[5:35] the end of the
[5:36] hall I used to sell in the meetings I
[5:39] had a little apron and i' go down and i'
[5:42] sell the little books there was three
[5:44] books brother brandom had Jesus Christ
[5:46] the same yesterday today and forever I
[5:48] was not disobedient to the heavenly
[5:50] vision Divine Healing in healing in the
[5:54] campaigns and I thought I was something
[5:56] get down there and sell those books and
[5:59] daddy would always and I'd see the the
[6:01] Lord move in the meetings and as a kid
[6:03] he'd tell us about these things and how
[6:05] the angel would meet him and I remember
[6:08] one night in this hotel room we sitting
[6:11] there and my dad's brother was working
[6:13] with us at that time he was driving a
[6:15] truck and his name was Donnie and he was
[6:18] the youngest of the brothers and he and
[6:21] I and dad were sleeping in the same room
[6:24] and I don't remember I know Dad says on
[6:26] tape that he that he took a pillow and
[6:28] throw it over and woke me up all I
[6:30] remember I woke up there was a pillar
[6:32] across my face and and he he had this
[6:35] pillar across my face and he says Paul I
[6:38] said yes sir it was about 2:00 in the
[6:41] morning and he says you know the angel
[6:44] that Daddy talks about I said yes sir
[6:47] and he said he visited me tonight and
[6:49] was telling me some things and about the
[6:52] meetings and how to conduct the meetings
[6:54] and what was going to happen and I said
[6:56] yes sir and he still had the pill across
[6:58] my face and he he says and I asked him
[7:01] could I wake you up and could I wake up
[7:04] my brother Donnie and he said the angel
[7:07] said you can wake up Billy And he says
[7:10] and he says can he see you and the angel
[7:12] said yes he
[7:15] said excuse
[7:17] me he says when Dad when dad takes this
[7:21] pillow from your face he says you know
[7:23] where the wi spacing know is over there
[7:25] and I said yes sir he said he'll be
[7:28] standing there and you can see
[7:32] him and I said okay remember I just 12
[7:36] years
[7:38] old and he took a pillow from my face
[7:41] and I thought it' be an angel with wings
[7:43] flying around but it wasn't like that
[7:47] there stood a man in that room dressed
[7:48] in Pure White and he had his arms folded
[7:51] like this hair down to his shoulders he
[7:54] just stood there one thing it remind was
[7:57] so outstanding to me he never spoke a
[8:00] word but he look around the room but his
[8:03] eyes was totally focused on my dad every
[8:07] move was watching my dad and I can see
[8:10] those I can see him yet now them eyes
[8:12] just going around the room he look at me
[8:14] and he look over at my Uncle he look
[8:16] back around like that he'd move his head
[8:18] a little bit but his eyes never left
[8:20] Daddy's Eyes and I grabbed daddy cuz I I
[8:23] didn't know it was a man standing in the
[8:25] room over by the window and and he I
[8:28] never forget day told me he says don't
[8:30] be scared son he said he sent from the
[8:33] presence of almighty God and he says he
[8:36] won't harm you he says he'll be a
[8:40] blessing I watching he just held real
[8:43] close and daddy held me and he went from
[8:46] that being of a man just as brother Bram
[8:49] describes him into I'm not going to say
[8:52] a pillar fire it was like a Mist a light
[8:55] a vapor he just kind of vanished and he
[8:59] he went out the window right out the
[9:00] room like that and when he left a
[9:03] rainbow come right in the same window
[9:06] and hung in that room for hours at
[9:09] midnight 2:00 in the morning dark room
[9:12] but he stood there in that pillow excuse
[9:14] me that rainbow stayed in the
[9:17] room I felt a
[9:20] presence and I asked my dad later I says
[9:23] why did that happen and he says he said
[9:26] cuz I wanted you to see him he said God
[9:29] called you to work with me Billy and I
[9:32] wanted you to see him and to know what
[9:34] Daddy was telling you was the truth not
[9:37] that I doubt it but it was just such an
[9:39] experience such a wonderful experience
[9:42] and all through my life I traveled and
[9:45] my job was to get Daddy in and out of
[9:48] the meetings and you know sometimes I
[9:50] let him stay too long and sometimes I'd
[9:53] take him too quick and you know I just
[9:55] young boy but I kept doing what he said
[9:57] and I give out the prayer cards and I'd
[9:59] bring the people up to him and sometimes
[10:02] I let him stay too long and he'd say
[10:03] Billy you let me stay too long tonight
[10:06] he says he says tomorrow night you don't
[10:08] give out prayer calls CU Dad's too t why
[10:11] i' to go home and I'd cry I'd be so
[10:13] upset cuz I messed up the next night's
[10:16] meeting then sometimes I take him too
[10:18] quick and he'd say you could let me stay
[10:20] a little longer no it was just a hard
[10:22] time but what a wonderful time I've seen
[10:25] the people just any disease I was
[10:28] thinking the other night
[10:29] you know you watch the news they call
[10:31] this disase that and they they change
[10:33] the name but it's all the devil it's all
[10:36] the devil but when the angel met him he
[10:38] said if you get to people to believe you
[10:40] nothing will stand before your prayer
[10:42] not even cancer and I'm a witness to you
[10:46] today that he's the same yesterday today
[10:49] and forever and what not one time from
[10:52] that time in that room when I saw that
[10:54] angel that I could always tell you not
[10:58] brother Bill but that presence I could
[11:01] tell when he was near even before daddy
[11:04] would say you know what I'm waiting for
[11:05] something I might be down the audience
[11:08] working the prayer line ushering
[11:10] whatever I might be doing but I could
[11:12] tell exactly when that angel come to the
[11:14] platform before dad sometimes even said
[11:17] he said he's here I knew he was so
[11:20] didn't make a difference what diseases
[11:21] was I knew when they left is going to be
[11:23] well but he said if you get the people
[11:25] to believe you and I was telling someone
[11:27] the other day I said I've seen him
[11:29] bring them in well and they sit there
[11:33] and make fun and they pack them out dead
[11:37] I seen them pack them out
[11:39] paralyzed and I seen them bring them in
[11:42] on a stretcher and they would be dead
[11:45] and I seen them walk out alive and well
[11:48] only believe so I just wanted to say God
[11:51] bless you and I like to just leave my
[11:53] little greetings to you and this if I
[11:56] don't see you in person I'll meet you on
[12:00] that day and I had the privilege when he
[12:03] was
[12:04] here to have the interviews for him to
[12:06] set him up I don't know how it's going
[12:08] to be over there I just know I'm going
[12:10] to be there by his grace and I said God
[12:12] Bless Me Above any man first of all he
[12:16] let me be his son he chose me and then
[12:21] he let me be a son of a prophet and to
[12:24] be a brother of a prophet and to have
[12:27] worked with both of the prophets my
[12:29] lifetime truly I've been a blessed
[12:32] man all we have to do is push play and
[12:38] obey God bless you and remember if God
[12:41] thought it brother Bram spoke it I
[12:45] believe it and that settles it God bless
[12:55] [Music]
