going to go straight into the message or the scripture to be able to see if we can take advantage of the time that we have we're going to be going into First Kings 171 and may the Lord bless you each and every one of you for being here I understand and that on T or Wednesdays it's a bit hard the majority of us have to work including myself but Brothers remember that there's always a reward at the end so in that manner that our work in the Lord is not in [Music] vain [Music] and Elijah the tishbite who was in the inhabitants of Gilead said unto Ahab as the Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be duw nor rain these years but according to my word let us pray to God loving Heavenly Father we want to thank you this evening for bringing us here tonight to be able to hear from your word help us to put ourselves to the [Music] side and that it be you that comes down and helps us help that me and my interpreter here become nothing but just doormats where the Brethren come and before entering into the sanctuary they clean their feet and if we can only help just one person this evening for here the people that are [Music] visible and also all those that are watching via the Internet we thank you Lord we ask you all of this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be [Music] seated if you wouldn't mind opening up your scriptures now to Malachi 3 and we will be reading from the first verse and I'm going to be at uh the first verse I first of all want to ask for forgiveness because on Wednesdays I regularly can't assist I have a sort of a strange job and tonight I'm supposed to leave at 11:00 but I've told God God and I've asked him Lord give me the strength and give me the desire to assist on Wednesdays it doesn't matter if I go in at 11 or 12:00 at night you will give me the strength because you are our strength and if we do your will then you will help us and I believe that he's going to help me to stay awake all evening so now that I've uh asked for forgiveness for Notting on Wednesdays I want to greet all the brothers that are watching via the Internet and this week I had a sister from Colombia contact me she would visit uh Phoenix Tabernacle a lot I don't know if many of you remember her but her name is Maria Elsa and she contacted me and she desires with her daughter and she has a daughter that's 16 years old and they desire to come and visit the United States and it's been about roughly 10 years since I've seen them and she tells me that sometimes she connects or or watches via the Internet and sees us and she gave me a very beautiful testimony of our Johnny or brother Johnny Al and she noticed that he was the founding pastor and she also noticed that our current Pastor is our brother Octavio so I want to greet all those brothers that are watching online and it seems like at times we only focus on the ones that are here present but there are many others that are watching us online and so wherever they find themselves we want to greet them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're going to be reading the scripture Malachi 31 do you have the scripture uh wish that you follow me because I'm going to go bit behold I will send you my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his Temple even the messenger of the Covenant whom you Delight in behold he shall come sayith the Lord host and I typically use a the Bible sco field since I had converted onto the Lord being a young man of 13 years [Music] old the denomination first reached me and now us with the revelation of the message we know that the churches out there they were like a little chicken coop where that little eaglet was found who didn't understand what was going on the the handen would uh PE and all the little chicklets would come and so they would eat whatever the mother hand would would kick off or she would but the eagle wouldn't do that the eag would stay behind only watching because it was not its nature it was born under the warmth of it and it was born in that chicken coop and it understood some of the things that were being done in that area but we know that it felt a little bit out of order and now we understand the reason why because it was an eagle it had that desire of an eagle inside instead of always looking down it would always look up just how we do it there's nothing to look down and we don't keep our head down we always must keep our heads up because we Now understand who is the one that's up there and so the Lord permitted me to find myself with this Scofield bible and it's the Bible that I've been using all of my life and this great man who wrote this Bible has a lot of things that really capture my attention an example it says here my messenger it says like this behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me so that verse there's no doubt there shouldn't be any doubt on us that he is speaking to us about John the Baptist and this evening I just bring a little bit of an ABC instruction for all of us something that captured our attention many years ago and I don't know when exactly you were the one that heard the message I grew up in a denomination after the Lord had uh called me he brought me into a denomination and I was there for a couple of years not many but the Lord permitted Me by 1972 for the first time to be able to hear the message of the hour and I was already pastoring a church being a young man and I believe I already gave you my testimony I had a bicycle that the organization bought for me so I could move around town and then they bought me a motorcycle and so then I started to feel like I'm I was a little a bit of importance and it was an automatic one and it wasn't one of those that you had to Kickstart to be able to get it going and it was one of those that I just had to do a push start so then they also gave me a home and all those brothers that have lived a couple of years they gave me a salary of50 P by week 150 week or 150 pesos every week but one day they came and they knocked on my door because I lived right next to the church and two men came and identified themselves to me one of them was called arindo and the other one was called Ram there was two of them they were coming from the city of ton and they were going to S Lis and I was in a small town called and there I was pastoring a small little church in the denomination and then when they arrive it was a day of service so I gave them the opportunity to be able to give a testimony and the first thing that I heard from them was malakiah [Music] 45 but their names uh just notice that I still remember their names ero and R those names were engraved in my mind they were the ones that brought me to the message they left books for me but the first message that I began to read was the anointed ones of the end time and then the first page when you open up that book brother Bram is on this side of the page but he's on the left side over here is he has his hand up and his tie is kind of moving on to the side and he has his hand pointing this way you the ones that are leading the blind one day you shall reap what you've been sewing and when he was doing that I took that as for me and that I haven't been able to forget it that has been many years ago so after being in the denomination the message of the hour arrived to me for the first time 1972 what a beautiful day that was for me I asked him for directions and then more Brethren came to visit me later on but I'll never forget the message that they had preached 45 and6 and later on we're going to be doing a little bit more emphasis on it but in the manner that they were explaining it and this is where we sometimes ask God that we study all week long perhaps maybe two weeks and then in that time I was only I was writing down what I was going to speak about today so then when we come un God we ask him to give us the words to be able to explain it in a manner that's going to be easy for everybody to be able to understand because it does us no good to be able to come to church to sit in the pews and not listen or understand how can we understand if nobody explains it to us that's what the that Walker was coming saying when he was coming from uh and then he asked him Philip do you understand what you're reading and he said how can I understand it if there's nobody here to explain it to me so then when we come here how important is it for us to be able to explain what we are talking and for the people to be hearing not only hearing but also understanding and then when we leave here if there is a message that we give them point it down or write it down if there's two or three messages and so then when you arrive home when you have that spare time open your books open your phone or your computer and begin to search out those messages and it'll be much more of a benefit for you and if there was something that maybe we couldn't explain but we gave you the message of the title and you look for it and you ask for god brother you're going to learn a lot more blessed be the name of our Lord and so then Malachi 45 and 6 is the ABCs for us but we must ask God to give us the understanding to understand what he's telling us look Brothers those that come from Mexico I don't know about the other nations but down in Mexico being a young man I would go go out through the streets and I would knock at the doors and the first thing that I would notice when I would go knock at the door and I would notice that that uh the title or that sign that they had at the uh a sort of a sign this place is Catholic if you don't give praise unto Mary don't knock that's simple and quanito instead of leaving he's right there knocking and the first thing that they would ask me because they would notice me with my Bible they would tell me didn't you read the sign out there do you know how to read and I told and didn't you read the sign yeah I read it so then if you don't believe in Mary then why did you knock no well I just wanted to tell you that I do believe in Mary you do believe in Mary how how can I not and so then that would open the door for me so then I would be able to go in there and explain to them the real plan of God and so then when it comes to to explaining and understanding that man said when he saw the water here's some water did do you understand what Philip said to you there's some water right here what's impeding for me to get baptized to his name be all the glory and so then when we accept this message we accept that because it was a revelation of God given unto us or do we believe it because our mother and father believe it because our grandparents also believed it brother in the Evangel the Evangelical work that I used to do I used to run into to people that would tell me I am a Catholic because my parents were catholic and my grandparents were catholic and so then they give you that family history right away but then when you start to ask him about the more profound things of God they don't know how to answer you because they're only only Catholics by just their family history and so then this message should be a revelation unto us I'm not here because my father told me not because of the fathers of my father told them I believe this message because I heard it yeah I understood it to his name be the glory and he deserves it because he's the one that gives us the understanding I understood it and then I had to make my own decision do I stay with my bicycle my motorcycle my house my salary and I was advancing and going up in the denomination or follow this message to come out of the denom the denomination and then when those Brethren that were from the den denomination came and spoke to me I told him I couldn't do it no more and I can't deny what I have received now this is Bible it's right here malakiah 45 is Bible God sent a messenger oh yeah we know that it was John the Baptist that's the that they have they all apply it to John the Baptist when you tell them that it's not only John the bapti but it's another man and that his name is William Mar Bram Brothers they can't see it or they don't believe it they never heard it and if they have heard it they don't want to leave their comfort and brothers when this was a revelation under my life being a young man blessed be the name of the Lord I told God I told them let me just give me the opportunity to be able to dismiss myself from the church and just as I was going outside and they told me they you forgot something the credentials of our denomination and I told him yeah and so then I took it out of my wallet and I handed it to them on the table and I and don't think that I ever came back this is it I'm out of here and then I went back with my parents in the city of Mexico because my mother had died when I was just a young child and so then in Mexico then I started to uh uh learn about the different brothers from the message Alfredo gonzale our brother Alfredo Gonzalez brother Jose Hernandez brother Anaya the great man of God brother fail brother Andres Perez from [Applause] veruz I began to meet new brothers from the message and began to visit and congregate with them and so then I believe with all my heart that the message of the hour must be a revelation unto you I believe this message and that's what you should say I believe this message because God has revealed it to me because I've searched the scriptures I've seen it and now I believe it with with all my heart and when God reveals it unto you nobody and absolutely nobody will be able to take it out of your heart blessed be the name of the Lord my messenger and this is what scoffield says it's John the Baptist the angel of the Covenant the angel of the Covenant is Christ and and both comings and his both comings now let's open up our scriptures and read another uh scripture and may the Lord help us this evening I have a lot of them and I have to choose now that we're on Malachi 3 we're just going to flip the page over to Malachi 4 verses 5 and six remember this is the ABCs for us but perhaps there might be somebody online there might be a young man or young lady look the sister that contacted me from [Applause] colia she once uh assisted to the Pentecostal Church even uh the apostolic church I'm sorry but then one way or another she found out or got in contact with brothers from Phoenix and she came and she visited the Tabernacle because she spoke with me and she gave me a little bit of her backstory but she says uh brother Kito the message I never forgot it I uh went to Colombia and I went and I visited many uh message churches and so may the Lord bless our sister that the Lord Finally Revealed the message and she came out of the denomination because you can't pertain or continue to be in a denomination that's where the hard part is and uh especially when you have a house and everything already built up and when the denomination is the one that provides it for you it's very hard for you to turn your back on it but then when it's God to his name be glory we're going to leave everything behind because Paul said that we brought nothing under this world and without a shadow of a doubt we're not going to take anything with us we've seen many funerals and we've come we've come close to the casket and they take absolutely nothing only that suit that the family had dressed them with that's it but they take no money with them everything stays here on Earth and so brothers and sisters may our eyes be on the heavens blessed be the name of the Lord amen Brothers let me just read a a quote here would write it down I'm going to be on page 314 of the fifth seal 314 and it reads like this and it's the fifth seal uh it's going to be paragraph 329 and it reads like this notice these men were kept Alive by God from their original Ministry talking about Moses and Elijah or Elijah mes once again notice these men were kept or men are kept the liive by God from their original Ministry for future service Moses died but nobody knows where his grave is only God knows it because many searched for him and they could not find him but Jehovah God did tell Moses come up to this mountain and I'm going to allow you to see the promis land I'm going to allow you to see it what your people are and truly are going to but you shall not enter why is it that Moses or Moses did not go in because god Jehovah told them to speak to the Rock because the people wanted water and there was no water and when there is no water we all know what it's like to be thirsty maybe some don't because we have water in in abundance but there are people here that know what it's like to be thirsty to his name be the glory so the order was to speak to the Rock and if he would have spoken to the Rock brothers that water would have flowed out of that rock to his name be the glory when God came down talking to the prophet and he told him where do you want the squirrels he chose three with three I think you can make a really good soup and he was in a location that was kind of impossible but he asked one for in this location and there it was and so then when Jehovah told Moses to speak to the waters would have came flushing out of that rock all right well that was mooses once again and it says like this think of it just think that Spirit of Elijah ministers five times I really like the numbers I don't know who else likes to do mathematics throughout the message and throughout the Bible I like the numbers and I also like the names and if we are Christians we're going to give a Christian name to our sons and daughters and a couple years ago I went to a school my uh wife is the one that goes I hardly go but in that morning I was very interested in going and they were calling out the children by their names and their last name their second name and I was there for my granddaughter and then I hear the person that who announcing the names and I hear the name of a of a young lady and it reads like this marijuana Martinez uh marijuana Martinez I see just like that marijuana Martinez marijuana Martinez marijana is there somebody here with the name marijuana Brothers I was very shocked I looked at my wife and I and and I tell her what did you hear what I heard marijuana Martinez marijuana Martinez what kind of name is that that's why I tell you that I like the names but that name I it dis I dis and I will never put that name onto any of my kids the names also have a very strong impact on the person and the prophet was coming in from Canada and he was traveling through a road and he heard a voice say turn to the Eastward and he began to count and he saw Seven Hills seven mountains and he says how many how many letters are in your name seven brothers seven and so the numbers are also very important and also the names Jacob Prince of God well when his name was changed amen because he was a a Shyer he deceived his father and he obtained the the preeminence but then when he battled wrestle with the angel your name shall no longer be Jacob but Israel which means Prince with God am amen and so that Spirit of Elijah ministers five times Moses 2 neither of them were dead don't you believe that they were dead they were both alive talking with Jesus on Mount Transfiguration but then also remember they must also die and then when brother bam is saying that remember that they must die without a shadow of a doubt he takes us to Revelations 112 their bodies shall be lay down on the roads of Jerusalem for three and a half days tremendous the Lord bless us and help us Amen to his name be all the glory we're going to go on to the next in the same book of Revel uh the seven the seven SE and we're going to go into the message uh God hiding himself in Simplicity page 26 now let's proceed so we can finish here within the next 20 minutes which is something that we also now notice the the day of Elijah God chose to hide in somebody that was simple think about it this was God's choosing remember in those days there were many rabbis many priests and great men even the great king Ahab was a Jew and there were many men of much Fame but God decided to hide himself in a simple man not in a scholar or a well-known man in the world like a general in a military he wasn't of a famous name for we didn't even know who his parents were and even uh scoffield stays a bit brief about that name there is no genealogy we don't know who his parents were who were the parents of John the Baptist zaras and Elizabeth to his name be all the glory we read it it's Bible and we read the Bible and we find out that we know that there is a genealogy we know who the parents of Moses were to his name be the glory but about Elijah we don't know and so that's the truth and it reads like this he wasn't a very famous man but we know not even know who his parents were we know nothing about his genealogy he was a simple Woodsman from those places who was uh raised with the purpose of being a prophet God prepared everything God prepared young Samuel Anna his mother couldn't have children and when she would go to the temple she would always go and pray to God if you give me a son I'll dedicate him to your service and then the Bible says better for us to not uh make a promise and not fulfill it and if we promise let us fulfill it quickly and I've told the Lord Lord put in my heart and help the company that I'm working with that instead of starting at 11:00 p.m. that we may start at 1: or 2: a.m. until this day it hasn't gone this way but I keep trusting in the Lord and I ask him help me to be able to attend on Wednesdays because I want to have fellowship with my brothers and sisters blessed be the name of the Lord amen Brothers we want fellowship with one another as he yes amen amen this uh talking about Elijah with the purpose of being a prophet God had a living alone out in the desert and the only thing that we know is that he came out of the desert and he condemned the ecclesiastical system that they had let me finish here and then I'll tell you something that when he comes out of the desert knowing that he was a prophet of God to be able to go up to a King and tell him straight into his face that a judgment was coming towards him and his people and his kingdom it wasn't something very easy it's like today if I want to go to the White House and brothers I won't even be able to reach it because of so many obstacles that they have we wouldn't be able to there's people that try to go in there but they can't they crash their vehicles at the gate there's so much security around and according to the world it's the most important nation of the world so it's sort of impossible to go and see the president but over there he was the prophet of God and when he would come out of the desert he would come and arrive to be able to say what the Lord had given and that's when he presented himself in the presence of Ahab and he told him there shall be no rain for three years until I call for it what kind of authority is that until I call for it blessed be the name of the Lord and that's how it was and that's what happened and then when that judgment had passed Ahab found himself with Elijah again and he told him to hurry and get back into his Carriage because there was a big rainstorm coming this way to his name be the glory and so then he was the prophet of God am amen and so we're going to read another scripture it's going to be on Second Kings we're going to pass Elijah and we're going to go uh Second Kings 2:19 glor glory be to his name Second Kings 29 if you find it if you would mind saying amen glory to God Second Kings 2:19 and it reads like this forgive me I'm in Chronicles and it reads like this and the man of the city said unto Elisha uh I pray thee the situation of the city is uh Second Kings yeah uh chapter 2 see uh verse 9 oh and it came to pass when they were gone over that Elisha said unto Elisha ask what I shall do for thee before I be taken away from thee and Elisha said I pray thee a let a double portion of thy Spirit be upon me and he said thou has asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when I am taken from thee it shall be so unto you thee and it came to pass as they uh still went on on and talked that behold uh there appeared a chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted uh them both saw Su and Elijah went up to the by the world went into heaven and Elijah saw it and he cried my father my father The Chariot of Israel and the horsemen of thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them into two pieces he took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan brothers that he stood and took the mantle that he took from Elijah and the River Jordan opened up in two ways and remember the prophet said we're going to use that anointing five times God will be using that anointing five times he used it in Elijah he used it in Elisha and now we're going to return back to Malachi 4 and let's read verse 5 and six behold I will send you the Prophet Elijah before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord that uh and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers L I come and smite the Earth with a curse and so we know that in verse six in the message it pertains to two coming John the Baptist uh announcing the first coming and the Elijah of our day announcing the second coming and when brother bam was baptizing in the Ohio river in 1933 and when I was walking over here I was waiting for my brother and I noticed that there was a couple of pictures up on the wall and there we see brother bam in the Ohio River baptizing and I said glory to God and there was a voice that was heard and there was a voice heard and when Jesus was baptized in the Jordan River there was also a voice that was heard this is my beloved Son to his name be the glory and so then Jesus was supposed to be baptized and he was baptized and there was a voice heard and brother Bram being in the Ohio River we also heard a voice there just as uh John the Baptist was a forerunner of my first coming you are sent with a message that will forerun my second coming we believe it that's an ABC for all of us and why is it that I'm repeating it and saying it we've said it many times and our brothers have preached it our brother Octavio brought this teaching about two months ago and I have it in my notes and he spoke to us about these five Ministries and so then this is just a repetition so that we do not forget because this teaching should be already engraved in us not to believe it because my mother believes it not to believe it because my father believes it and I fear that some of us that believe this message only because they're father and it has not been a revelation to their life and that's the reason why there's still problems in our lives we can't take out those things that we need to take out because brother once we empty ourselves completely and so then we can now fill ourselves with something to his name be the glory we need to empty ourselves completely of everything so that he can come and fill us with his word with the message and then to be able to say as that uh woman said we no longer believe just by your saying said the woman uh the woman said we know that the the Messiah is coming and when he comes he's going to we know that he's going to tell us all these things and hear me brothers and when he comes he's going to tell us all these things and Jesus told her I am who speaks with you blessed be the name of the Lord I am the one who speaks with you to his name be the glory that's why she left her bucket and she ran into Samaria and gave the news to everybody and no and she said we no longer Believe by your say but now we have seen it and heard it to his name be all the glory amen may the Lord bless us and help us there's so much to be able to say and I said that I'm going to try to take advantage of the time and I think I am may the Lord help us and bless us I left many things unconcluded but I think we should leave it for the next time how many of you are happy let us stand and if the musicians can come up us remember this is just the ABCs this is the message that maintains Us Alive God first but this is the message that gives us the strength and the courage to his name be all the glory am amen has it been a revelation to your life Malachi 45 has concluded in this day let pray Heavenly Father Lord this was just a simple preaching something that all of us could understand although we left many things undone but I'm trusting that those brothers that know where it's at will run to it those Brethren that are watching online I'm sure that they already know these things but if if it was possible to help at least one of them Lord there's no price to this because one soul is many millions and millions of Worlds there is no price and so then we thank you for this message that you have given us for those five anointings and we know [Music] Lord
