to our pastor brother [Music] oav for allowing me to be able to stand behind this Pulpit thank you brother I would also like to thank his family and this beautiful congregation I would like to bring forth the greetings from our brother ru and I'm very grateful that he permitted me to be able to come and greet each and every one of you I want to also thank brother Fernando palomares and his wife I am staying at his home and he has given me the gift of bringing me here with you and I found uh certain loved ones I haven't been here since 2019 many certain things happened that paralyzed the entire world and in this worldwide crisis I was found or stuck in the country of Mexico Mr and I was prohibited from returning to my home for 79 days 79 days without seeing my loved ones my wife and my kids but in those 79 days it was very fruitful and I want to be where God wants me to be I don't want to be somewhere where God doesn't want me to [Music] be and I also want to greet my sister alv and her family may the Lord bless you beloved sister you are one of my heroes and after four years I'm finally able to tell you this eye to eye and we see that the Apostle Paul was the one that wrote the majority of the New Testament and he was also prohibited of his Liberty he was incarcerated and the devil hit him where it hurt him the most because he was a preacher and the devil and the devil ended up incarcerating him with the thought that this was going to stop the gospel from and I can imagine the Apostle Paul a little troubled and I can see him kind of suffering for his uh impedence I can see him when God tell telling him grab your pen and start writing and he started to write to write and then write 14 letters the letters of Paul the one of the most important ones was the letter of Romans the letter to the Hebrews the letter of Hebrews was meant so that it would boost the faith of the newly converted to motivate them to not go back cannot go back to their old traditions and the enemy began his work since the very first age the Apostle Paul was preaching and also likewise was the Antichrist so then he began to write this beautiful letter and then when we come to see the 13th chapter of the letter of Hebrews and we can see that in this letter he provokes us to be doing good works he tells us to honor our pastor to invite their faith and to obey them but then he also tells us that we have nothing that's going to be permanent on this earth and the reason why I'm expressing this tonight it's because of things that I have gone through and I wish to share with you as a pre pracher of the Gospel I'm supposed to be with my w eyes wide open and I must learn how to sleep with my eyes open and I should always be alert and I should always be aware of what's going around in my surroundings because there are children of God that I must take care of as a man of God it's it's meant for me to be living a little bit higher I should be as a guardman so then if I see some kind of danger coming I should alert the God's people but then all of a sudden this covid-19 came along and it surprised each and every one of us and for me I got the shock of my life in the sister city of and then when I saw that I was prohibited going back to my country and then when I find that my country went into a humanitarian emergency and then when we begin to see each people dying one by one I began to judge myself and I began to ask myself why didn't I see it what was approaching what happened to me where did I drop the ball and then all of a sudden I was just thinking about my calling and then I found myself that I was more worried about con uh building a name for myself and I find myself that I was going losing my mind with in the missionary work I judged myself and I had asked God for forgiveness that I should have been aware of what was coming that I should have told my brethren be get ready begin to uh have storage but I was so worried in my calling that all of that just flew over my head and the Lord forgave me but he left me with some great lessons I've learned that things can change from one instant to another and I've learned that we are not owners of anything on here that we have nothing that will ever last forever on this Earth and I've come to realize that what I have right now is not even mine not even the things that I have seen are mine last year on the eth of March and I I saw a danger come to my life there was a couple of robbers that came under me and I was at the brink the point of returning back to the grave and I remember when they had taken me to the doctor there was about seven people waiting and I was bleeding and then all of a sudden they began to take my clothes off and never in my life did anybody know my nakedness only but I was there cleaning on to life asking God to give me another opportunity my wife my kids my mother give me another chance Lord and then in the clinic they had already taken off all my clothes they took off everything that I ever had my ring my watch and even my uh prosthetic teeth and right there I had learned that nothing is mine and then I began to ask myself if nothing is mine then why am I fighting if nothing is mine then why am I defending myself if nothing is mine then why am I claiming it if I if nothing is mine then why am I feeling jealous what what do I gain from all the fights that I've had if I'm going to leave or lose and I ask the Lord to give me another opportunity to live a different life I ask the Lord to give me another opportunity to walk a different way I have failed Lord I have clinged on to the worldly things and I forgotten that I am not of this Earth and I forgotten that I'm only a a pilgrim i' forgotten that this is not my Earth and that I have another one waiting and I ask the Lord permit me to stay here that I may be able to warn my family to not be worried so much about the world that I may be able to tell my family to not fight for the Earthly things [Music] right there at that clinic almost agonized I began to see life in a different manner my left leg almost gone and they had told me that I was going to be walking like a horse just trotting around my leg wasn't obeying me and I had realized that God wanted me to experience the quietness and I began to ignore all those negative thoughts that put me down I began to ignore the fear and Tremor I began to resist the devil By ignoring him and I began to learn how to stay began to learn how to deny my own selfish thoughts and ideas and God wanted me to learn and God wanted to show me that I'm not of this Earth and even though that I had already preached it a 100 times it had never gone to be a revelation for me and I had come to realize that I I was only wasting my life and I began to see that I was neglecting that precious thing called life and I began to see that life was actually a present and I was just putting it to the side for vain and glorious things and vain discussions and disputes and I began to meditate on all those disputes that I had with with my wife and I began to meditate on the discussions that I had with my children and I began to meditate on the discussions that I had with the minist and all of my anguish and my uh anger and I began to see that life was just flowing out of my hands and I began to see that life was only made out of moments and I began to see that life is only just but a little Passage through eternity and I began to cry bitterly in the in the clinic for all the times that I had gotten angry for all the times that I began to get bitter for all the times that I had defended myself I began ask God to forgive me and I began to see life in a different Manner and then I realized the love that I never seen [Music] before and then I began to discover a love that that grew out of emergency and I knew that my wife had loved me but when I saw that I was dying I saw that the love of my wife began to grow tremendously and I began to see a love in my children that I never knew and I began to see the love in my brothers and my sisters and my mother that I never seen before and right there without even being able to Mo leg I began to thank God for giving me a second opportunity and I love to be alive and I love to feel the heartbeat of my heart and I love to breathe I love to see my wife my children and my own mother and I love to see the human being and I'm very grateful unto God for that second opportunity Brothers life is giving us lessons and today I visited the cemetery and I stood next to the grave of our brother Sergio Na and also our brother Betto Romero and also our brother L Ruiz and I also stood next to the grave of brother Bernie Garcia and I saw myself crying next to the grave of our brother Danielle Garcia and also of our brother Ezekiel Mor and I began to see all the Tombstones and all the graves and I began to ask myself what is life what is life life is a gift life is a present and we should take advantage of those moments to hug our wives to hug our children to hug our loved ones and to hug one another Brothers you have no idea how distru my heart is I love my brother Johnny Alvarado but it hurts me to not be able to see him and I love the bbas and it hurts me not to be able to see them and brothers God is giving us another opportunity and God wants us to learn to live life and brothers that the very thing that was preached onto US is already at our hands and everything is lining up for that special moment and us the God every God's people must align ourselves along with it and I come to realize that if time continues on that our heroes are going to abandon us and we've just suffered the loss of our precious brother Billy [Music] Paul and I couldn't realize that the light started fading away and darkness is starting to invade the world that which we live in and brother it's time to look at each other and ourselves and begin to examine our own selves and to go and check our motive and objectives and begin to ask ourselves how are we living life and my brothers I cry daily and being that I'm standing behind here I cry daily and it hurts in my heart for what's going on in my country and it hurts in my heart heart to see what's going on worldwide and it yearns in my heart to see the manifestations of the children of God beloved Brothers the same Lord with a shout of acclamation the shout of Angel and he shall descend from heaven and the dead in Christ shall rise first we're seeing the very first part of The Descent of the Lord Jesus Christ we're living in the acclamation in a t in a time of of learning a time of preparation come out of her my people and it's time for us to get ready and it's time to receive the message and it's time to live this message and as long as we don't do it then we ourselves are hindering the resurrection of those that are dead in Christ Jesus and those that remain here says the Bible sh not hinder the those that are asleep that I find out that if I don't surrender myself that I'm the one that's hindering that resurrection that I find out that if I don't die to my own that I am hindering the resurrection and the Earth is groaning moaning of the restoration of everything of what Earth are you speaking I am Earth something deep down inside me has to be groaning and crying out for the manifestation of the son of God which lives inside of me inside of me and inside of each and every one of you there's a child of God that lives in [Music] there that was created to the likeness of God and that for me creates a great desperation because time is at hand and the devil never sleeps and he knows exactly how to get to every one of us he knows where to hit us he hits me on a daily basis and he knows how to approach me and he knows how to approach each and every one of you he knows how to get to you he knows us after 6,000 years he's learned to examine man what is it that we have to do we must hide ourselves and clothe ourselves of the full armor of God because we have here no continuing City nothing is mine nothing is yours I'm not going to take a single thing all of our bank accounts so I'm not going to take all the precious stones gold and silver everything is going to stay properties everything shall be nothing but just fire I have 56 years and after 40 Years of those I thought that this was me and then I come to realize one day that this is not really me I live here this is my home and it's fading away I look at inside the mirror and and I say to myself where have you gone and I began to get into a desperation because I begin to feel that my strength is going away and I've come to realize that I haven't preached enough and I've become to realize that haven't done enough I look in the mirror and I begin to see that my hair wants to turn white I begin to do the math and then I begin to see that I only have a few years left of life and it's much later than we think it's much later than we think only on this Earth do we have the opportunity to do something for the Lord Jesus Christ I didn't come to realize really what Pur was I only yearned to be happy I yearned to have a good marriage and I yearned to have a very good family and I long to be a very good church member and I yearned to be able to support the cause and i' never come to realize that each and every one of us has a responsibility given by God you and I have been given a responsibility and that responsibility is to preach this gospel to every living creature on the earth and I didn't know I was asleep in church and I didn't realize what my true responsibility was here on Earth you and I are responsible to lift up on high the torch of this gospel and God one day is going to come and ask us what we have done with our own lives God is going to come and ask us what we have done with our own time and God is going to ask me if I haven't given her the time that she deserves God will ask me what was the time that I've given to my children and God will also ask me what I've done with the time that I've given to my parents everything has its time the Bible says there is a time for everything God doesn't want me to give his time to my wife God doesn't want me to give away the time that is for my children and there's a time for everything and to see how things begin to line up I begin to get desperate with him I'm desperate that is the reason why I have come to this country once again after four years and God knows how much I longed to be here when brother but the humanitarian crisis did not allow us to be able to leave our country God knows how badly I wanted to be here when our brother passed away rero when our brother Betto Romero passed away when our brother naar passed [Music] away and when when our precious brother Bernie Garcia passed away I yearned to be here I wanted to yell out that I love them I wanted to shout the profound respect that I have every I want to shout that we should love one another and in this shall we know that we are children of God and I wanted to shout to the world that the life is going slipp out of our hands and we've been called to reflect that light of the even each and every one of us is a light when when I was a child when I was 15 years old I was already an orphan and there was nights that I would sleep with there was a day that I had walked over 8 kilom to my house I was very hungry I was hungry I didn't have no money and I began to walk looking down at the ground with the hope of finding a coin or some money to be able to buy some bread and then all of a sudden I found a a a piece of paper on the [Music] ground and when I lifted it up it said I live in a dark country where Darkness rains and in the darkness shame and the shame misery and in the misery a fist our hand willing to work willing to work to bring forth the light to this Dark Country brothers and sisters we live in a dark world where Darkness Reigns and then and the Darkness Reigns uh shamefulness misery and then the only hand that can give us the light once again are each and every one of us the children of God the world is getting darker and this doesn't mean that God is asleep God does not sleep the ones that are sleeping are us I am sleeping the preachers are sleeping because it's us that have been called to to lift up on high that torch of the Gospel it's each and every one of us that must bring forth the love it's us that should bring forth the mercy and love we're the ones that we supposed to lift the banner up high with what Grace is what is Grace it's a present or gift that is not worthy I didn't deserve Grace and you didn't deserve Grace but Grace had saved us and by Grace saving us automatically we ourselves become Grace I am Grace I am love and I am Mercy I am forgiveness and I am restoration everything that's in God is also inside of me and brothers I'm going to say it once again everything that is in God is inside of me everything that is God is in you I look like God and you look like God my children look like me and they must look like they are my children and when I say that I am a child of God in reality what I am saying is that I look like God within me there is a living creature that came out of God and one day it shall return and everything that is in [Music] God is also within that creature brothers and sisters this message is more than just words this message is much more than seron this message must be a form of living I must be the message made flesh each and every one of you called to be the message the greatest message preest is not one that has been the greatest sermon that preaches our own lives and with my own life I'm preaching to the people and when I don't forgive I am preaching that I do not believe in forgiveness when I don't do Mercy I am preaching that I do not believe in Mercy brothers and sisters we are called to live this message and the world is tired of preaching there's millions of preachers preaching simultaneously the world has the need to see men and women as written Epistles read of all men because the greatest message that ever was preached is not of words this message is to be living with your own life brother preach to the people with your own life brother brother scavi what can I do my husband shames me my my husband despises and he puts me down what must I do just be a Christian brotheri nobody wants to talk to me nobody wants to help me nobody gives me an opportunity what must I do just be a Christian brother scaros I am the most despised what must I do just be a Christian but we can't be a Christian if Christ is not in us the only way that I can be a Christian is that Christ lives in me I'm not a Christian by going to church I'm not a Christian by being a good Deacon I'm not a Christian by being a preacher I'm not even a Christian by being a pastor we can only be Christian is if the Life of Christ Living in us and if Christ is in us then we no longer live and now Christ lives in us and if the Life of Christ is in us how are we going to act exactly the way that Christ beh and who was Christ a man of love if there was somebody that knew how for it was Christ father forgive them for they know not what they do that was Christ he was pure love he was Mercy walking around the Forgiveness the restoration walking around if Christ's life is not in me then I'm a deceiver when I say that I'm a Christian oh precious Brothers to be like Christ in this life is what I long to be how many times have not that that hym should not only be a song it should be a way of life amen thank you Lord one day a well-known man of the Bible he asked me to define the word Christian and I thought to myself that's easy Christian is a a follower of Christ this doctor he smiled and he said no Christian means Christ and I saw that it was that way when I say that I am a Christian I am saying that I am Christ and in the only way that I could be Christ is for Christ to be in me in the month of October in the year of 2003 I was in a service and I was a deacon and all of a sudden the Holy Spirit began to fall down and at that time I had already been in the church for about 25 years and never in my life did I ever experience something so powerful all of a sudden the preacher had said I am sick and tired of looking in the mirror and looking at myself I am tired of speaking and hearing my own voice I don't want to look like my father I don't want to look like brother Bernie Garcia and when I heard that I I I was shocked and I said to myself will I want to be like ber Garcia will and all of a sudden he said I don't want to be like William brandham and once again I I fell back but I thought to myself I want to be like William BR he said I want to look like Christ I want to be Christ and that should be our need and that should be our desperation the holy spirit is more important than the air we breathe the holy spirit is more important than life itself without the Holy Spirit then we have failed without the Holy Spirit we have lost this battle without the Holy Spirit then we're completely lost without the Holy Spirit we know nothing about love without the Holy Spirit we know nothing about forgiveness without the Holy Spirit we don't know nothing about what Mery is without the Holy Spirit we don't know what Grace is and a man once told me over 20 years ago that the world is dying just for an ounce of love where is the love sitting in the churches where is love the love should be in me the love should be in all of you love should be in each and every daughter and son it should be in all the preachers and the love should be in the ministry the love should be protecting the door the love should be cleaning the church and love should be directing and love should be present in all things if we have not love then we're just hate it's either hate or love beloved [Music] Brothers the day that we have been preaching for so long is now at hand and just as how we were surprised with this pandemic that's how many people are going to be surprised after that change happens and people will continue to go to church but God will no longer be there it's time to see our own selves it's time to check up on ourselves and it's time to check up on our own personal experience and it's time to ask ourselves how are we with God I had asked a brother once how are you with god brother how is it with you and God and this Minister brother began to cry all of us must ask ourselves how are we with God it doesn't matter if we're preachers it doesn't matter if we're ministers it doesn't matter if we're the children of the P it doesn't matter if we're the wife of the pastor it doesn't matter if we're the parents of the pastor it does not matter we all must check up on ourselves to see how we're with God and I ask myself every instant in life how am I doing with God and I can't be right with God if I'm not okay with my brother I can't be right with my brother if I'm not okay with my how can I love God if I don't love his children how can I love God if I don't love my brother how can I love God if I don't forgive my brother the only way that I can serve God Is by serving one of the only way that I can love God Is by loving his children and this is a worldwide need there is a great pandemic the lack of love that is the worst of the worst the lack of love and the world is dying the churches are dying the marriages are are the children leaving the homes because of the lack of love and if there's something that we must ask for ask God is give me love love for your word love for my neighbor and love for myself we were cut off guard by this great sickness and it has taken many people and we've cried and we've experienced many and it has affected us the absence of our but what about the P the brother brandham says that everything that happens in the natural happens we didn't want to hang around with the one that had Co we didn't even want to be five meters close to him I'm not going to get close because then I'm going to get infected but there's another Co the lack of love there's another Co the lack of faith there's another the lack of the Holy Spirit there's another not knowing how to forgive there's another Co not ask for forgiveness what about that it is a silent disease that we have no idea when it comes in the Bible tells us don't be afraid of the destroy the Flesh and how have we taken care of ourselves from this Co but what about the spiritual Co how many brothers have been left on the Wayside how many have left the way and how many have gone after incorrect doctr how many children have left home how many marriages have been destroyed how many ministers don't speak to each other what's going on covid-19 emergency where are the doctors where's the medicine where are the hospitals people used to say don't take them to the hospital you're going to kill them how many of you have heard that I'm closing now when I was a kid I didn't know I was a preacher but when somebody was next to me and people would begin to get surprised because and when they would tell me take me to your church a voice would tell me they would tell me don't take them you're going to kill them and that voice spoke to me until years and I never took anybody to church I testified I read about the message and I read about the Bible and when they ever asked me to take them to church the voice would tell me don't take them you're going to kill them so then I said to myself then I'm the devil I'm a son of the devil how is it that I'm not supposed to take them but then I remember one day they had sent two ministers from here to Peru over 20 years ago I remember remember that we got into a taxi and I got into the back seat and then all of a sudden the Holy Spirit fell down in the taxi and when I saw these they were practically drunk have you ever seen a drunk person that's how they were completely drunk and the taxi driver was shaking and crying and then all of a sudden once we got to the place and these two men once they got out of the car they went uh stuttering to the inside the office and I stayed behind with the taxi driver and the taxi driver asked me what is this and I told him this is the Holy Spirit and all of a sudden he tells me take me to your church please and all of a sudden the voice never spoke to me again so then I made an agreement with him that tomorrow I will take and then I thought to myself finally I'm going to take so then I went to the voice of restoration office and the brother told me and what terms did you finish with the brother and I told him well tomorrow I'm taking him to church he told me no don't do it please don't do it why not you're going to kill them so then what am I supposed to do first take him to Christ and then you can take him to church because if you take them to church you're going to kill them but first take them to Christ and so when they see the problems that are in church they're not going to move because they are first so then I remember the words of Christ follow me Peter and I will show you how to fish how do you fish some are fish with sticks and spe and others are fishing with dynamite and some with anchor and hook how do you fish one day I saw a man take a horse and he got up to the tree and he broke a branch off and all of a sudden I I see him taking the leaves off and I began to think why is he taking the leaves off of that BR and all of a sudden I saw him Dominate and he put him in subjection and in half an hour this Fierce horse was the most tamed horse of all and then later years on I went on I saw another Cowboy dominate a horse but he wouldn't use any Force he would have his uh hands in his pocket and I didn't know what was in his pockets but then all of a sudden I saw that he took out some sugar and he would tame the horse with the sugar it didn't need any for for it didn't need any kind of pressure only sugar what is sugar sugar is love preaching without is just a preaching without love is just nothing but and the preaching of the word of God and the word of God is torment it's a deliver what is it that jari needs sugar love who doesn't like love everybody needs love the homes need love the churches need love and the pastors need the ministry need we all need love and the world is uh Dying For Love why does a man get drunk isn't it because of the lack of Love why is it that they go after the drugs isn't it because of the lack of Love why does a man isn't because of the lack of love and all the problems are because of the lack of love we need love each and every day and there in the hospital dying I learned a new love that I never knew and I thought that I knew already enough about love and there when I almost gave up the spirit I realized that I knew nothing about love I preach about love but love is unmeasurable we uh preach about Grace we know very little about Grace because Grace is unmeasurable we need Grace and we need love my name is Grace and I hope that each and every one of us can be called love hope each and every one of us can be called and I hope we can all be called hope we can all be called Mercy Mercy is what I want and not judgment judgment without Mercy for those that who do not do the Saints that are asleep cannot be perfected the building will be and what is it that makes it perfect is love where is love I know that the majority of you are from Mexico and there's a famous singer called Jose and he sings a song that it's entitled where is love and then I come to realize that this guy is AET he has more Revelation than I do where has Love Gone to where is love love is right there love is right there love is right here and love is right here we just need to let it flow within us we just need to let it flow within we must open up our doors in our heart and let and be free we need to let love just flow that love be portrayed and let love take complete control sit that there is is love love is greater than an atomic bomb and love is right there please stand with me let us pray brothers and sisters bow your heads with me Lord Jesus Christ Heavenly Father here is your blood and here are your [Music] children and here is the reason for your sacrifice and here is the reason why you left your throne of glory and here is the reason why you became a human and this is the reason why you gave your life one drop at a time and here is
