my thanks you all for uh for the invitation upstairs foreign [Music] in Tucson last year and uh as a part of that I was I'd been praying to the Lord to have a little Camp to take our daughter Asia too she's 13 and we're looking looking for a little place for the absent Fellowship is we sat together at the place we were at and he said would you come and Minister for us at our youth campus and I was like requests and uh something inside said you were asking for a place to take your daughter weren't you yeah I'm answering right now are you gonna pick are you gonna take me up on my offer contest I appreciate that and the friendship yes and to all you as well all the brothers and sisters there's a lot of friends that I see throughout Amigos so many familiar faces and so many folks here so many friends we just want to say good evening friends we love the Lord and we love you we love you all my wifey bed and my daughter Asia they came along [Music] foreign everybody puts her nice clothes on on Sunday and you can hear some nice Christian music and get yourself in the spirits on a Friday night when everybody's tired that's that's the best time Jesus said come unto me all you that are that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest that we're here today and there's only one place that there is rest in this world and that is on the unfailing unchanging unsearchable Promises of God yes that is what gives us rest tonight so with that if you would all please stand and we're going to open our Bibles in just a moment and then throw them before we do um before we uh open his word before we open his book says it's always good to approach the author of the book first there's a lot of books in this world that I I will never meet the authors but this is the top selling book of all time no other book that's been printed More Than This Bible and you have the opportunity to meet the authority he'll even sign your book for you tonight he'll sign your book in his own blood would you let them tonight the author is here to sign your book but before we open it let's just approach him now your heads our dear Lord Jesus Lord there is only one way that we come to you this evening that is by thy blood tonight no one of us are sufficient tonight we approach Thy word tonight is sufficient tonight it is sufficient to heal the sick it is sufficient to save the souls it is still sufficient to cleanse sin tonight precious sacrifice that you made for us in other words we open my word he simply asked that the Holy Spirit would come into the word tonight would it become alive to each one tonight and whatever need that amen in the book of First Corinthians chapter 11 and that is going to be verse one we're going to read that and uh and when you have it you can say Amen First Corinthians chapter 11 verse and it says this is Paul speaking okay yes be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ amen may the Lord has blessings to the reading of the word he will be seated so uh in this in this short verse that we just read it's all we're going to speak about tonight is and in this very short verse there's a great truth in it the great truth is there's two kinds of people in the world there are imitators existing imitadores and there are imitations two kinds of people you're either an imitator or you're an imitation which one are you tonight so there's a difference between the two existence the biggest difference between those two La difference is who do they follow is again the biggest difference in the imitator and the imitation is who do you follow the difference so that's where we're going to go tonight we're not going to stay real long and we just have a little of your intention for just a little while so we're gonna we're gonna give a little background first and uh we're going to touch on something that that might make some of you upset it might make you a little upset if you do find yourself getting upset tonight just know that I'm your brother I'm not your enemy I'm just your brother hello yeah we live in a real world God is real tonight the devil is real tonight there are real blessings tonight and there are real dangers tonight your walk is real and your choices are real decision is and there's not an app for ituna application there's no app no application that's going to tell you which is the right choice to make and which is the wrong choice and so some of you might already be figuring it out here's another preacher going to talk about our phones you're gonna scold us about our phones no I'm not here for that tonight but all we want to be is be real with you for just a few minutes so let's be real if you want to be real can you read your hand all right that's wonderful okay you're sitting next to a real person there's a real person sitting next to you don't just turn turn to the to the person next to you and shake a real hand they're like well this is my brother this is my sister I know they're real um that's a real brother a real sisters so we just want to be real for just a few minutes I was reading an article in a magazine that's put out by focus on the family and it was an article about the the problems that we face in society today regarding devices all electronic devices and the article was telling everybody about you gotta be real El articulo for good things I got friends that they're like I almost got all my steps in I think Amigos I only need two billion more to go do that count your steps every day real worried about how many steps let me tell you something tonight don't worry about how many steps you took foreign who are you following tonight I've heard many say that I'm a follower of this one on tick-tocks all right I'm a follower of so and so on on Facebook and Facebook or Instagram or in Instagram I hope this isn't digging too hard right but uh I'm a subscriber to someone's YouTube channel the YouTube so if you ever found yourself saying those things and be honest with yourself again I'm not here to scold anybody in particular I've got to walk this walk and the fingers point at me first but be honest with yourself have you do you ever say that I'm a follower of this one or I'm a follower of that one if uh if you do you you may be in real danger okay not not virtual danger virtual you may be in real dangerous because there's because Satan has figured something out he's figured out a way to take something that's not real foreign what are those those five things I just said what are those I just said is the five minutes to the spirit right we know the body has five minutes but our spirit has inlets and the devil will use our eyes and our ears take something that's not real and then all of a sudden our imagination and our memory and our conscience and our reason and our affection imagination all of a sudden it becomes and you hear way too much that a young person took their life because of something that became real to them that should have never been real okay if you find yourself caught in one of those website yeah it's real it's algo real your body is real your spirit is real and your soul is we're not playing games tonight I pray that that we have your attention ask her ask yourself what am I following dig on this a little bit more MIT and uh MIT the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in uh Massachusetts Institute of Technology they're a world leader in technology and science and they did they did a study on our followings of of with our devices here are some of the symptoms that they identified listen close attention the study by one of the top places of the world on this is these are the these are the symptoms desires the sales boredomiento x-ray of your inner life dangerous rabbit holes self-harm suicide addiction addiction social threat not being satisfied detection detection micro targeting these are real things they're not happening to not real people this is happening to possibly someone in this room tonight so knowing this about many social media platforms you think you're following somebody but that's just bait on the hook is following somebody on these platforms platform it's not just a way to connect you with others it's a way to trap you might say oh brother you're just getting all this is the world that we live in is we need these Technologies Technologies you're not you're behind the times brother hermano yesterday I have one song for you tonight I'll sing it the best way give me that old-time religion give me that old-time religion give me that old time religion it's good enough for me it will make you stop your lying it will save you when you're dying it will start the devil flying and it's good enough for me is it good enough for you tonight it's old-time religion is you don't need a software update for the old-time religion Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever but believe me bro Hermanos Hermanas I do live on the same Planet as you do Yota and I understand and I'm not telling you to shut down unplug all that if you find something take you your footsteps down the wrong path learn how to recognize it be aware the Bible says in Isaiah 5 14. and the prophet Isaiah is saying this because the people were following the wrong things and they've failed to consider the work of the Lord in their lives and the prophet came out and said therefore Hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure and their Glory and their multitude and their pomp and he that rejoiceseth shall descend in yeah I pray that this is real to you tonight I'm your brother I'm just here to warn you yes you have to consider the Lord in every moment of your life even when you're connected be aware you might see a little benefit from them because they'll provide you with a little bit of perceived Unity but oftentimes this Unity is false um oh that's bad brother you're just bad news all day long today but there's good news tonight because if there's a false one it's only pointing that there's a true one somewhere there is a true one tonight in Christ there is connectivity and there is true Unity and it'll Build You Up it'll establish you Unity will be is so listen closely give you a conspiracy theory this technology is the technology it's not developed with your well-being in mind a lot of these things you think they're they're doing is good they're not doing good with your good in mind it's developed to gain information about you is the world of artificial intelligence not real intelligence it's being based yes on what is being harvested from you and me the that information that false intelligence is coming from what is harvested Tick Tock was built around the recommendation or algorithm programs you can look that up for yourself the algorithm uses your followings uh Los algoritos it takes your views your likes your conversations well I hope you're feeling violated right now by this is your your followings your views your likes your conversations to build a profile on you and then it knows the danger is how quickly it can come to know you yeah you get down on the clicking business building who this person is and how quickly it can know you quickly it can trap I hope I'm scaring somebody tonight I heard a report of people who said Tick-Tock knew about more about them in a few minutes then anybody would know for the rest of your life Masters Academy there's a real one tonight the real one he created you for more and he made you for a purpose and before the foundation of the world was placed he didn't need you to click click click hello and he already provided a way of Escape for you and me yes the real one he knows how many times he'll blink your eyes he knows how many times he'll comb your hair you don't know how many hairs are on the comb when you're done and he wants to be in your life but you have to afternoon and he has a name it's a real name and my real name is Jesus you might not think that a God who can possibly know that much about you says if garbage that's made by men somebody so quickly foreign praise the Lord amen he is your creator tonight we're about two-thirds of the way done everybody okay just got a few more minutes that was a little background now let's get into the scriptures First Corinthians again Paul says Be You followers of me even as I also am of Christ so here in this verse we missing we misunderstand this verse a lot we say that Paul said follow me as I follow Christ we've repeated it that way many times but the way it is written Paul said to follow him even as he is he also is of Christ he also is of Christ in First Corinthians chapter 4 in primary Corinthians Paul also said you have 10 000 instructors in Christ but not many fathers he goes on to say that in Christ Jesus says I Paul Joe Pablo have begotten you thank Andre in the channel of the message so by this understanding we can say that Paul said he said follow me how are we supposed to follow in Christ increased in the word that is the only correct way that we can follow tonight you'll never understand brother follow me even as I also am said I'm in Christ [Music] we get outside of that angel from teaches you something different so where's the Misunderstood it's in the it's in the statement follow me in Greek in the Greek or be an us as he is that's hard that's hard to understand this is in our message title is imitator or imitation is not talking about imitations there are many invitations in Christianity there are many artificial imitations produce false religion imitations hard to tell the difference is in fact and Jesus said in Matthew 24 24 Jesus they tell the imitation [Music] thank God that our prophet clarifies it but it is foreign but every everything imitation every great name is everybody if you were being accused of being a Christian o and you went before for every great name imitation Michael Kors of course coach lamarca coach some of the girls are like they're he's not saying the right names yeah lots of imitations every great name has what's the difference it looks just like it has the name but I can get it that's good right let me tell you something tonight he gave everything that he is this real man this is a take his life for me he would lay him in real life and if he was willing to pay the greatest Price it's the same but I can get it is you make bad decision is and I saw this person I said that's a good deal on this foreign I I had to give that present to my wife fortunately she's gracious she used it it didn't take long and it was not usable anymore no but she used it but uh but what makes the difference in a in a real and a fake the difference is who made it you're real tonight somebody a master I know that that watch was made with the finest materials in the world foreign Metallica so it is in the religious World many put the name of Christ but all they have is a green band around them a green religious bands that man-made religion will just leave a marker is a true Christian it is the genuine Life of Christ he said he had a little while in the world will see me no more but you shall see me foreign change where your footsteps is look at different things you're born of Christ the word and that word comes to a prophet yes and it is through that channel of the message you follow that channel by one Spirit foreign a true Christian doesn't make their life up it is Christ Living in them doing the works of Christ on Earth today a true Christian follows Christ the word um and nothing else will do Jesus said my sheep hear my voice Jesus and I know them he knows you tonight my sheep know my voice and I know them nothing else will do everything else is imitation it might look like the real thing but the difference is if you're not in Christ the words something else let me ask you a personal question if you want for just a minute this could be the night that you break free is am I being real with myself am I truly following Christ the word or am I following after something else we're going to close it in just a moment [Music] our oldest daughter Chloe she I think she's online I think my mom and dad are online as well we have this painting hanging in our home that she made for us brother Branham I believe it's in the message broken sisters listen close to this is Brother Branham says the more of Christ you put on the more conscience you will be of your own conditions this is the word of the Lord that came to the prophets the more of Christ you put on the more conscious you will be of your own conditions if you choose to follow Christo it'll make you become more conscious of your conditions [Music] you gotta be ready for that if you're not ready if you're not really ready to follow Christ don't just take his name you'll be responsible for that if you take the name of Christ done you better be ready for Wars because when you take the name of Christ it'll make you become more conscious of your conditions and that wakes the devil up yes some people say the devil sleeps for a lot of people he snores in their life you don't have to do nothing we beat ourselves we take our we ourselves we we reach and we glad and we fight our way to hell when tonight there's every barricade blocking your way don't go that way there's a cross in front of each other you have to fight your way over the cross to get to Hell foreign [Music] that is a lie to it'll make a drunk that walks off Street and accepts him tonight on the same level as the greatest Christian that there is that is the blood of my Jesus Christ but they'll try to make you he'll try to make you worry that you're not worthy is just keep following Christ God placed you here with these brothers remember our brothers and precious brother there's a Channel of the word there is Jesus said don't worry you just keep following me just keep following Christ you only feel that way because when you follow Christ the devil starts to lose the battle El Diablo he's making you feel that way because he's losing the battle for you [Music] let him go not worth your blood but Jesus he'll hold you tonight even when you can hold yourself maybe you say I can't hold on but there's a truth tonight that when we can't hold on holding on to your rope tonight he's anchoring your soul you just keep following him is that your desire tonight would you stand is that your desire tonight just bow your heads before we pray we gotta we gotta ask tonight is there anybody here that's never given their heart to the Lord Jesus tonight if you haven't would you raise your hand real hard we're not promised tomorrow you're given we're given our opportunity [Music] so let me ask this now is there anybody here that wants to be a true follower of Jesus Christ rededicate your life to the Lord tonight [Music] I'm going to ask one more thing now tonight keep everybody keep your hands up is there anybody sick here tonight by the same sacrifice that cleanses from sin foreign Lord when there was a deep calling in our life there was a deep responsible tonight you see the hands that have gone up Lord Jesus they have done it in Faith Lord God that you are present Lord they promised that you'd be here it's just as you would do 2 000 years ago you do the same thing tonight would you go amongst each
