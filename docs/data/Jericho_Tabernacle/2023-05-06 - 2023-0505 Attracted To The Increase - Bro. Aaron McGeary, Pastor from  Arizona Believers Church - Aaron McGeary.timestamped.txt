[58:22] and Shepherd in his people
[58:25] by his word
[58:27] and so I wanted to share a statement of
[58:30] brother Branham
[58:33] and he was he was expressing something a
[58:36] conversation he was having with his wife
[58:40] and they were just setting up on top of
[58:42] South mountains
[58:45] overlooking the valley
[58:48] and I share this as my heart
[58:52] he said here's what brings me here
[58:56] even though it's in darkness
[58:59] and the sin that's in the city
[59:03] there are some testimonies of the Lord
[59:06] living statues of Christ down there
[59:10] I come to put my shoulder with them
[59:15] Shine the Light of the gospel
[59:18] evangelo and he says some of those
[59:20] little old Brethren down there on the
[59:21] street corner somewhere
[59:37] he said I come to throw my part with
[59:39] them
[59:42] to shine a light of the unadulterated
[59:44] Gospel of Jesus Christ
[59:49] to the great Metropolitan metropolitan
[59:52] area of the City Phoenix
[59:56] he said I come to put my shoulder with
[59:59] theirs and he said
[1:00:01] to put my heart with theirs
[1:00:04] my voice was there and cry out against
[1:00:07] the darkness
[1:00:09] and that's why we're here
[1:00:11] putting our shoulder together
[1:00:14] with the men of God who have sweated it
[1:00:16] out
[1:00:20] and so we're here standing on the
[1:00:22] shoulders of giants foreign
[1:00:25] to put my part with theirs
[1:00:28] and so Arizona Believers Church
[1:00:32] stand shoulder to shoulder with you
[1:00:35] not toe-to-toe and eye to eye no uh
[1:00:41] to proclaim the message
[1:00:46] [Applause]
[1:00:48] amen
[1:00:49] [Applause]
[1:00:51] if we could turn in our Bibles to
[1:00:52] Matthew 21
[1:00:56] I'm grateful to have the opportunity to
[1:00:58] minister is
[1:01:01] my burden tonight is to encourage
[1:01:03] message Believers
[1:01:06] is
[1:01:08] I think that's why we have special
[1:01:10] services
[1:01:13] to increase our faith
[1:01:16] and so I want to preach on a subject
[1:01:18] that's at the heart of the believer's
[1:01:20] face
[1:01:24] and do it in a way that reminds us of
[1:01:27] what we've gathered around
[1:01:32] and what has gathered us together
[1:01:35] Matthew chapter 21
[1:01:39] verses 1-11
[1:01:43] this is when they drew Nyon to Jerusalem
[1:01:45] and were come to Bethpage under the
[1:01:47] Mount of Olives then sent Jesus two
[1:01:49] disciples
[1:01:58] saying unto them go into the village
[1:02:00] over against you and straightway ye
[1:02:02] shall find an ass tide and a cult with
[1:02:04] her loose them and bring them unto me
[1:02:16] and if any man say art unto you you
[1:02:19] shall say the Lord hath needed them and
[1:02:21] straightway he will he will send them
[1:02:29] all this was done that it might be
[1:02:31] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:02:32] prophet saying
[1:02:38] tell you the daughter of Zion Behold thy
[1:02:41] King cometh unto thee Meek and sin it
[1:02:43] upon an ass and the cult the fall of an
[1:02:45] ass
[1:02:48] is
[1:02:54] the disciples went and did as Jesus
[1:02:56] commanded them
[1:02:59] and brought the ass in the cult and put
[1:03:01] them on their clothes and they set him
[1:03:03] thereon
[1:03:05] is
[1:03:09] and a great multitude spread their
[1:03:11] garments in the way others cut down
[1:03:13] branches from the trees and strobbed
[1:03:15] them in the way
[1:03:23] and the multitudes that went before that
[1:03:25] followed Christ saying Hosanna to the
[1:03:27] son of David blessed is he that cometh
[1:03:29] in the name of the Lord hosanna in the
[1:03:31] highest
[1:03:34] Alturas
[1:03:42] when he was coming to Jerusalem all the
[1:03:44] city was moved saying who is this
[1:03:51] and the multitude said this is Jesus the
[1:03:54] prophet of Nazareth of Galilee is
[1:04:01] could we bow our heads in a word of
[1:04:02] prayer
[1:04:04] gracious Heavenly Father Celestial thank
[1:04:07] you for the privilege that we have
[1:04:08] tonight
[1:04:13] thank you Lord that we can sing praises
[1:04:15] together
[1:04:18] thank you for the musicians
[1:04:25] Lord for the trustees that have done
[1:04:27] their part
[1:04:29] for the deacons doing their part
[1:04:33] for all the labor and effort that's put
[1:04:36] into moments like this
[1:04:41] we recognize your grace and being able
[1:04:43] to have services like this
[1:04:47] to see so many churches coming together
[1:04:52] this is a wonderful privilege
[1:04:55] thank you Lord that we could open this
[1:04:57] Bible
[1:04:59] and read these
[1:05:19] open these things to us now I pray
[1:05:24] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:26] amen
[1:05:28] amen amen God bless you you can be
[1:05:30] seated
[1:05:35] well there it is
[1:05:39] I I preached till my bottle of water
[1:05:40] runs out
[1:05:45] and I didn't didn't have a bottle of
[1:05:48] water so I was about to sing take the
[1:05:49] name of Jesus with you
[1:05:55] I was kind of getting used to preaching
[1:05:56] with the piano I guess I'll do a solo
[1:05:59] now um
[1:06:05] if we could read in Zechariah Chapter 9
[1:06:07] verse 9 quickly
[1:06:10] my title tonight is attracted to the
[1:06:14] increase
[1:06:18] attracted to the increase
[1:06:21] in Matthew 21 already makes reference to
[1:06:24] this
[1:06:26] but it says in Zechariah Chapter 9 verse
[1:06:29] 9.
[1:06:31] Rejoice greatly o Daughter of Zion
[1:06:56] and so we see that when Jesus comes
[1:06:59] riding into Jerusalem foreign
[1:07:46] it brings all the critics up
[1:07:49] the vultures
[1:07:51] and the Eagles also they come together
[1:07:55] to find out what's going on
[1:07:59] some coming for curiosity
[1:08:03] you're coming to find faults
[1:08:06] coming to criticize
[1:08:08] there's all kinds gathered
[1:08:11] as we said this morning
[1:08:18] what's on the mountain
[1:08:21] prophecies being fulfilled
[1:08:24] so the Fulfillment of Zechariah 9 9.
[1:08:29] attracted a crowd
[1:08:32] and it was a mixed group
[1:08:59] he said they all came to see what was
[1:09:02] happening
[1:09:04] and as they're all gathered together
[1:09:07] they're shouting Hosanna
[1:09:12] osana and it says all the cities move
[1:09:16] but it's just a short time afterwards
[1:09:20] that's the very same people that removed
[1:09:25] demanded his crucifixion
[1:09:28] so they could be gathered to a spectacle
[1:09:32] spectacular they can even get caught up
[1:09:34] in the movement
[1:09:37] the very same voices that said crucify
[1:09:40] him
[1:09:42] may have been saying Hosanna
[1:09:46] and so just a few days later
[1:09:49] they're demanding his crucifixion
[1:09:52] crucifixion because they did not see the
[1:09:55] Fulfillment of
[1:09:58] prophecya they had come to an attraction
[1:10:02] attraction but they missed the true
[1:10:04] attraction
[1:10:06] and whenever God fulfills prophecy
[1:10:10] it always causes
[1:10:13] it always draws a crowd
[1:10:16] but not everyone recognizes why they're
[1:10:19] gathering
[1:10:21] in the days of John the
[1:10:24] Baptista his ministry caused an
[1:10:26] attraction
[1:10:29] and he gained the following
[1:10:32] Bible says that Jerusalem went out to
[1:10:35] him
[1:10:37] all Judea went out to him
[1:10:40] in all the region round about Jordan
[1:10:44] we're coming to see John beniana he was
[1:10:47] anointed with the spirit of Elijah
[1:10:50] he was commissioned to introduce the
[1:10:52] Messiah
[1:10:54] and some came to see a wild man
[1:10:57] others came because they were curious
[1:11:00] but it attracted multitude
[1:11:03] and as the multitudes Came
[1:11:06] John was preaching Juan predicaba John
[1:11:09] was baptized Juan Bautista but he was
[1:11:11] also prophesied
[1:11:13] and he was prophesying that the Messiah
[1:11:15] was coming
[1:11:17] and as he was preaching
[1:11:20] baptizing
[1:11:23] and he said in John 1 26 and 27.
[1:11:28] their standeth one among you this is who
[1:11:32] you don't know
[1:11:33] he says here it is he says who come in
[1:11:37] after me
[1:11:38] you've heard before me yes
[1:11:41] so he was preaching that there was one
[1:11:44] coming after him
[1:11:46] and in John chapter 1 verse 29
[1:11:50] says the next day
[1:11:52] John see if Jesus coming unto him
[1:11:56] and said behold the lamb of god
[1:12:00] let's taketh away the sin of the world
[1:12:03] so John is preaching is
[1:12:10] doing this day after day
[1:12:13] and it's a tract in a crowd yes
[1:12:16] the Bible says the next day
[1:12:20] he sees Jesus coming
[1:12:23] he says Behold the Lamb of God
[1:12:27] takes away the sins of the world
[1:12:33] foreign
[1:12:38] and the sermon what is the attraction
[1:12:41] attraction whether banham is saying that
[1:12:44] the crowd is saying We Believe Moses
[1:12:48] they believe they're prophets
[1:12:51] he says I can hear John answer back
[1:12:55] and he quotes Isaiah 40.
[1:13:02] don't you know this fulfills prophecy
[1:13:07] this is what John is saying this
[1:13:09] fulfills prophecies
[1:13:12] prophecy was being fulfilled
[1:13:16] and about that time the prophet turned
[1:13:19] and said
[1:13:23] behold there comes the Lamb of God
[1:13:27] that takes away the sin of the world
[1:13:30] now what's the attraction
[1:13:34] it changed from the prophet Del profeta
[1:13:39] John was anointed with the spirit of
[1:13:42] Elijah
[1:13:44] the spirit of Elijah brings you face to
[1:13:46] face to the Messiah
[1:13:49] so he was preaching
[1:13:54] don't prophesy
[1:13:56] says the attraction changes
[1:14:02] it changed from the prophet
[1:14:05] to the Fulfillment of his prophecies
[1:14:09] it wasn't just him prophesying
[1:14:14] was what he was saying was coming was
[1:14:17] now the attraction attraction
[1:14:22] now whenever God fulfills his word
[1:14:26] brother Branham says it's god making
[1:14:28] history
[1:14:29] [Music]
[1:14:31] it always causes an attraction
[1:14:36] but where God is usually missed
[1:14:40] is in the change in attraction
[1:14:44] when the light moves on
[1:14:47] it's easy for people to live in the
[1:14:49] glare of another age
[1:14:53] it's the nature of mankind
[1:14:57] to always praise God for what he has
[1:14:59] done
[1:15:00] looking forward to what he will do
[1:15:03] I miss what he's doing now
[1:15:07] they praise him for what he's done
[1:15:10] and look forward to what he will do
[1:15:13] they don't recognize what he's doing now
[1:15:19] they don't really know what he's done
[1:15:22] and they'll Miss what he's going to do
[1:15:27] the book of Isaiah the book of
[1:15:31] malachias prophesied of John the
[1:15:35] Baptista said there would be a
[1:15:37] forerunner
[1:15:38] there would be a messenger before his
[1:15:41] face
[1:15:42] and so when John Cameo Juan it changed
[1:15:46] from the prophets
[1:15:48] to the fulfillmento
[1:15:51] it wasn't good enough to believe Isaiah
[1:15:53] Isaiah
[1:16:01] 's ideas
[1:16:09] but once John came one just believe the
[1:16:13] prophets
[1:16:15] to receive the Fulfillment of the words
[1:16:20] God interprets his word by bringing it
[1:16:22] to pass
[1:16:24] the manifestation is the Vindication
[1:16:29] the manifestation is the interpretation
[1:16:33] and so when God interprets his word by
[1:16:36] bringing it to pass
[1:16:39] no matter how much you honor the
[1:16:43] prophecya you dishonor God when you
[1:16:46] reject the Fulfillment
[1:16:48] in Matthew chapter 11 verses 9 to 11 and
[1:16:52] Matthew
[1:16:53] Jesus says of John the Baptist Jesus but
[1:16:58] what went you out to say is
[1:17:00] a prophet
[1:17:07] for this is he of whom it is written
[1:17:10] behold I send my messenger before thy
[1:17:12] face
[1:17:16] we shall prepare thy way before
[1:17:21] he was more than a prophet
[1:17:23] because he was the word made flesh
[1:17:26] the word had specifically prophesied in
[1:17:29] that Ministry
[1:17:32] and as the word was being fulfilled
[1:17:36] the word fulfilled is the word made
[1:17:38] flesh
[1:17:41] when the word comes to life
[1:17:44] that's the interpretation of the words
[1:17:47] the manifestation of the word is the
[1:17:50] Vindication
[1:17:52] when the word is manifested
[1:17:55] it's fully authenticated
[1:17:58] so a prophet is Vindicated
[1:18:01] foreign
[1:18:42] he was the messenger of the Covenant
[1:18:45] he was the breach
[1:18:48] he was the Keystone between law and
[1:18:50] Grace
[1:18:53] Brother Brad I'm calling him the
[1:18:55] Keystone
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:18:58] that stone in the middle of an ark
[1:19:01] is
[1:19:03] an arch over in an entryway
[1:19:09] he was the Keystone
[1:19:12] holding it together
[1:19:14] he says what did you go out to see
[1:19:19] and I say unto you more than a prophet
[1:19:23] he said he was a bright and Shining
[1:19:25] Light for a while
[1:19:29] he was the word made lights
[1:19:36] so John the Baptist comes
[1:19:39] as a messenger of the Covenant
[1:20:40] comes in the bridge Crystal
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:51] so John was the messenger of the
[1:20:52] Covenant in this one element said he was
[1:20:55] the word manifested
[1:20:58] the Bible says in Luke 16 16.
[1:21:02] the law and the prophets were until John
[1:21:06] since that time the kingdom of God has
[1:21:09] preached and every man presseth into it
[1:21:14] the law and the prophets were until John
[1:21:17] you said
[1:21:19] Juan they're in effect until that time
[1:21:23] John was between the law in the
[1:21:27] dispensation of Grace
[1:21:29] John comes in that in between times
[1:21:33] between law and Grace
[1:21:35] and so he's going to blend it into the
[1:21:38] gospel
[1:21:40] the law and the prophets
[1:21:44] the kingdom of God
[1:21:48] there's a change that comes
[1:21:56] the law was in effect
[1:21:59] until the moment that Christ is
[1:22:01] crucified
[1:22:05] Jerusalem was in effect
[1:22:08] we were doing perfect brother Emmanuel
[1:22:12] I'm not pitching a perfect game anymore
[1:22:13] yeah yeah
[1:22:15] that one's on me
[1:22:17] Jerusalem was in effect until that
[1:22:19] moment
[1:22:21] but now that Christ is on the ground
[1:22:26] the old system's done away with
[1:22:30] bringing a type of that in the day that
[1:22:32] we're living in yeah
[1:22:34] because Jesus Christ was being crucified
[1:22:37] again
[1:22:39] and so here comes John and sometimes in
[1:22:43] the transition turn in a corner
[1:22:46] that is where God is missed
[1:22:50] because Elijah was blending
[1:22:52] dispensations
[1:22:54] one is
[1:22:57] beginning and John has to stand there
[1:23:01] out John you can't make your way under
[1:23:04] the new ones
[1:23:06] he's got to tie the two together
[1:23:09] and that's where people are usually lost
[1:23:14] transition
[1:23:24] but brother Branham says in modern
[1:23:25] events May clear by prophecy
[1:23:27] events
[1:23:29] the believer can see the word made flesh
[1:23:34] the others cannot do it
[1:23:37] the believer can see the word made flesh
[1:23:41] John chapter 1 verses 4 to 11 in Juan
[1:23:45] Uno says in him was life and the life
[1:23:47] was the light of men
[1:23:52] and the light shineth in darkness and
[1:23:54] the Darkness comprehended it not
[1:23:57] respondes
[1:24:01] they weren't able to comprehend him
[1:24:04] they weren't able to grasp him
[1:24:07] and it backs up a bit in verse six
[1:24:11] there was a man sent from God whose name
[1:24:13] was John it is
[1:24:16] the same came for a witness
[1:24:19] to Bear witness of the lights
[1:24:27] he was not that light
[1:24:30] but was sent to Bear witness of that
[1:24:33] life
[1:24:35] brother Branham was not that life
[1:24:38] but he was sent to Bear witness of that
[1:24:40] life
[1:24:43] that was the True Light
[1:24:45] which lighted every man that cometh into
[1:24:48] the world
[1:24:50] this is the one that John introduced
[1:24:52] yesterday
[1:24:54] John was not the light Juan but he stood
[1:24:58] in the bridge
[1:25:01] and he introduced the life
[1:25:04] that was the true life and in verse 10
[1:25:07] he was in the world
[1:25:10] and the world was made by him
[1:25:13] and the world knew him
[1:25:16] came unto his own and his own received
[1:25:21] the very ones that believed in the
[1:25:26] said we have our father our fathers
[1:25:30] the ones that said we have Moses
[1:25:34] rejected the one that Abraham believed
[1:25:39] rejected the one that most of Moses
[1:25:41] prophesied
[1:25:49] his own received him not
[1:25:51] the very ones that ought to have
[1:25:54] received him
[1:25:57] I know we we like to think of those that
[1:26:00] rejected him
[1:26:02] as being the Pharisees
[1:26:07] maybe the scribes
[1:26:11] but it was even followers of John Iran
[1:26:14] Los mismos
[1:26:16] in John chapter 3 verses 22 to 30.
[1:26:20] it says after these things came Jesus
[1:26:22] and his disciples in the land of Judea
[1:26:24] this is
[1:26:27] and there he tarried with them and
[1:26:29] baptized
[1:26:31] so Jesus ministry is begun and this is
[1:26:34] Jesus he's baptizing
[1:26:37] there's followers
[1:26:39] and some of these followers of Christ
[1:26:43] had been followers of John Anthony
[1:26:46] Juan and then the Bible says something
[1:26:48] very striking
[1:26:50] and John also was baptized in aeon near
[1:26:53] the Salim because there was much water
[1:26:55] there and they came and were baptized
[1:27:03] so Jesus's Ministry has begun and today
[1:27:07] Jesus and John is still continuing
[1:27:10] he's still baptized
[1:27:12] says for John was not yet cast into
[1:27:14] prison
[1:27:17] then there arose a question between some
[1:27:20] of John's disciples and the Jews about
[1:27:22] purifying questions
[1:27:27] just imagine what's taking place
[1:27:31] Jesus is preaching the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:27:33] Jesus
[1:27:37] they're following with Jesus Jesus
[1:27:42] and John's Ministries continuing you
[1:27:44] don't see it is
[1:27:45] he still has his own disciples
[1:27:49] and these his disciples come to John
[1:27:51] Jesus
[1:27:53] and they came under John and said unto
[1:27:56] him Rabbi
[1:27:58] he that was with thee Beyond Jordan
[1:28:07] all men come to him
[1:28:10] notice what they're saying
[1:28:13] John you know the one that you
[1:28:15] introduced to us
[1:28:21] he's baptizing and they're taking
[1:28:24] exception to it yes
[1:28:26] I had not caught the change in
[1:28:28] attractions
[1:28:31] so John answers and says
[1:28:34] a man can receive nothing except to be
[1:28:37] given him from Heaven foreign
[1:29:15] Rejoice of greatly because of the
[1:29:17] bridegroom's voice
[1:29:20] yes my joy therefore is fulfilled
[1:29:25] John's Joy was complete
[1:29:30] his ministry had been Vindicated
[1:29:33] his ministry had been authenticated
[1:29:37] the very one that he said was coming
[1:29:42] and he said I can rejoice
[1:29:45] as a friend of the bridegrooms
[1:29:48] because I hear the bridegroom's voice
[1:29:52] and thus my joy is complete foreign
[1:30:05] long after John had introduced the
[1:30:07] Messiah
[1:30:10] there were still those who were only
[1:30:12] following John Aviana
[1:30:14] Juan and they were having problems with
[1:30:17] the Messiah
[1:30:18] and they were using John's quotes about
[1:30:21] the Messiah
[1:30:23] see what John said about the Messiah
[1:30:29] they weren't attracted to the increase
[1:30:33] something had risen it was a rising of
[1:30:38] the Messiah
[1:30:40] something was coming in the
[1:30:41] manifestation
[1:30:43] and they knew that John was a man sent
[1:30:46] from God
[1:30:48] you knew that John had the truth
[1:30:52] I knew that John spoke against the
[1:30:54] corrupt religious system
[1:30:58] he knew that John had called out the
[1:31:00] politics
[1:31:08] they've been attracted to all those
[1:31:10] parts of his ministry
[1:31:13] but they had not caught the main
[1:31:15] attraction
[1:31:17] principal brother Brandon says in the
[1:31:20] beginning
[1:31:21] first one of the New Testament was John
[1:31:23] the Baptist
[1:31:25] John stood between law and Graves he
[1:31:28] said Juan is La Gracia
[1:31:38] neither was he under the law
[1:31:41] he was the Forerunner of Jesus Christ
[1:31:46] of himself
[1:31:48] that he was born out of Seasons
[1:31:52] John doesn't come into the Christian
[1:31:54] dispensation
[1:32:01] a voice of one crime in the wilderness
[1:32:04] make a way
[1:32:09] now please catch this part
[1:32:13] the first one to introduce the faith for
[1:32:16] the Christian Church
[1:32:21] none other than Jesus himself
[1:32:25] so John introduced the church to Christ
[1:32:30] is the one that it introduce the faith
[1:32:35] to the Christian Church it wasn't the
[1:32:38] Elijah no foreign
[1:33:21] Christ was the increase
[1:33:26] I know we can get nervous seconds
[1:33:30] we start talking about Jesus Christ
[1:33:35] and the increase of the one yeah and the
[1:33:39] decrease of the other is
[1:33:41] but when Christ is the increase
[1:33:45] it's not at the expense of the
[1:33:47] Forerunner
[1:33:49] the decreased does not diminish his
[1:33:52] ministry
[1:33:55] the crease of John Juan menguando does
[1:33:59] not diminish the ministry of Elijah
[1:34:02] it Vindicated
[1:34:05] the increases the Vindication
[1:34:09] the rising is the Vindication
[1:34:12] you can say what you want about The
[1:34:15] Messengers
[1:34:16] you can say what you want about brother
[1:34:19] Branham
[1:34:20] but join the vindication
[1:34:28] there's been
[1:34:31] increases
[1:34:38] Jesus could not have been who he was
[1:34:40] Jesus
[1:34:42] if John wasn't who he was
[1:34:45] can you make sense of that
[1:34:49] if John wasn't the Forerunner then Jesus
[1:34:51] wasn't the Messiah
[1:34:54] so to recognize the increase
[1:34:58] does not do away with that which is
[1:35:00] decreasing
[1:35:03] you still have to have that which stands
[1:35:06] in the breach
[1:35:11] now Matthew chapter 9
[1:35:14] verses 14 to 17.
[1:35:18] we've already read where the Disciples
[1:35:20] of John went to John de los disciples
[1:35:23] and had a problem with the ministry of
[1:35:26] Jesus Christ
[1:35:29] maybe felt that he shouldn't be
[1:35:31] preaching because
[1:35:37] and John says this is the Vindication of
[1:35:39] my Ministry
[1:35:42] my joy is complete
[1:35:45] he must rise he needs to grow he used to
[1:35:50] have the preeminence
[1:35:52] not me no Joe I'm not that Christ I'm
[1:35:56] not even worthy to unloose the shoes
[1:36:01] and then in Matthew chapter 9 verse 14.
[1:36:05] then came to him to Jesus
[1:36:08] disciples of John Los disciples
[1:36:12] saying why do we and the Pharisees fast
[1:36:16] after this
[1:36:19] but thy disciples
[1:36:23] notice how they had their own identity
[1:36:28] we are the followers of Elijah
[1:36:32] we believe the prophets
[1:36:34] and we do things a certain way
[1:36:38] why do we fast a lot
[1:36:41] but your disciples do not fast
[1:36:45] and so they're questioning the
[1:36:47] Vindication of John's Ministries
[1:36:50] using their own Traditions
[1:36:57] to questions the Vindication of Elijah's
[1:37:00] Ministry
[1:37:02] and Jesus answer
[1:37:06] [Music]
[1:37:39] the
[1:37:44] very one that was
[1:37:50] and you do not recognize it
[1:37:54] he says but the days will come when the
[1:37:55] bridegroom shall be taken from thee this
[1:37:57] is
[1:38:03] now in the sermon the voice of the
[1:38:05] signal
[1:38:07] brother Branham takes the ministry of
[1:38:09] John element
[1:38:11] He says John The Prophet's appearing on
[1:38:14] Earth
[1:38:17] after 400 years without a Prophet this
[1:38:20] was
[1:38:21] the sign after 400 years of him
[1:38:24] appearing
[1:38:27] says that little LAX times
[1:38:31] he says now if you're spiritual you'll
[1:38:34] catch what I'm saying this is
[1:38:42] that he would say things in a roundabout
[1:38:44] way
[1:38:46] but that the believer would catch it
[1:38:49] says if you're spiritual and this is
[1:38:55] May God open up your understanding
[1:38:59] he says how long has it been
[1:39:36] to wake up to what God was doing
[1:39:41] do not be caught in that
[1:40:01] cuatro
[1:40:05] said how long has it been he said
[1:40:08] 400 years
[1:40:10] Israel without a prophet
[1:40:13] churches that got so twisted up
[1:40:16] and then here come John on the scene
[1:40:20] Pentecost got all twisted up
[1:40:23] in just 15 years
[1:40:29] Humanity had gotten into it
[1:40:33] and they begin to nominate and
[1:40:36] everything got all twisted up
[1:40:39] God had to send a messenger
[1:40:42] William Branham as the angel messenger
[1:40:45] of laodice
[1:40:47] to get to address the churches that are
[1:40:50] all twisted up
[1:40:54] John was the prophet Juan El profeta a
[1:40:57] sign that the Messiah was going to speak
[1:40:59] after him
[1:41:03] watch because Malachi 3 said
[1:41:06] I'll send my messenger before my face
[1:41:11] to prepare the way
[1:41:13] to prepare the people
[1:41:17] now if I could just make a side comments
[1:41:21] this is the first time for most of you
[1:41:23] to hear me preach
[1:41:26] so I very selfishly
[1:41:30] decided to preach something that we all
[1:41:31] believe this is
[1:41:36] and feel really good about myself
[1:41:41] and cover the basics
[1:41:43] the brother Daniel brother Steve
[1:41:46] have the Liberty to really get into the
[1:41:48] good stuff
[1:41:50] and so you just you just get into this
[1:41:53] with me
[1:41:54] if you've been waiting to the end of a
[1:41:57] man be let's just start it now
[1:42:00] because I'm preaching what's attracted
[1:42:02] to you
[1:42:04] I'm affirming your face
[1:42:07] I'm not correcting I'm not questioning
[1:42:11] I'm acknowledging tonight
[1:42:14] the reason why we're here tonight
[1:42:18] it's because we've heard the voice
[1:42:20] of the one that smokes
[1:42:23] after the Forerunner
[1:42:26] many of us were here in the days of
[1:42:28] Brothers ministers
[1:42:37] introduce Jesus Christ foreign
[1:42:41] and here we are tonight
[1:42:48] brother bam says look at John
[1:42:50] no selfishness in him
[1:42:53] he never took any Glory
[1:42:56] Gloria they tried to call him the
[1:42:58] Messiah
[1:43:01] they do the same thing with brother
[1:43:02] Branham
[1:43:04] they try to call him the Messiah
[1:43:08] but the hypocrisy is their own Messiah
[1:43:11] said they're antichrists
[1:43:18] they tried to call him the Messiah
[1:43:21] but he said I'm not worthy to lose his
[1:43:23] shoes
[1:43:25] but as soon as Jesus appeared
[1:43:28] Jesus
[1:43:33] like a dove come down a voice saying
[1:43:39] I'm well pleased
[1:43:42] and John immediately said
[1:43:45] he must increase
[1:43:48] I must decrease
[1:43:50] he presented the church to Christ El
[1:43:53] president
[1:43:56] of the church
[1:43:59] he stepped back
[1:44:28] bring together an invisible Union
[1:44:33] he presented the church to Christ El
[1:44:35] president
[1:44:36] we're told that in the last days
[1:44:40] we'll repeat again
[1:44:45] the same thing will repeat again
[1:44:49] he says there's going to be a message
[1:44:51] come foreign
[1:45:15] there is going to be a message come
[1:45:17] forward
[1:45:18] that'll introduce the Messiah to the
[1:45:20] people
[1:45:22] and E it'll be in such a way
[1:45:26] they'll stand dumbfounded like they did
[1:45:29] then
[1:45:32] he promised it
[1:45:35] so just as they missed the increase in
[1:45:37] the days of John Del Christmas
[1:45:40] they were dumbfounded they were confused
[1:45:44] they rejected the light many continued
[1:45:48] to follow John
[1:45:49] and question John
[1:45:51] question the Messiah
[1:45:55] says that will repeat again
[1:45:57] [Music]
[1:46:00] if I could say this about John's
[1:46:01] disciples
[1:46:04] they were distracted by the decrease
[1:46:09] instead of being attracted to the
[1:46:10] increase in business
[1:46:12] they're distracted by the decrease
[1:46:18] in Acts chapter 19 and it shows
[1:46:28] if I could say this is
[1:46:33] in the light of so many efforts to
[1:46:34] diminish the ministry William Branham in
[1:46:36] uh
[1:46:41] we could instinctively try to try to
[1:46:44] defend it foreign
[1:46:59] in Acts chapter 19 verses one to three
[1:47:04] now this is after the institution of the
[1:47:06] Christian church
[1:47:10] this is after Christ's return back on
[1:47:12] the day of Pentecost
[1:47:15] it says it came to pass that while
[1:47:17] paulus was at Corinth he said
[1:47:21] Paul having passed to the upper Coast
[1:47:24] came to Ephesus
[1:47:27] and finding certain disciples
[1:47:31] we've read of these disciples in John
[1:47:34] chapter 3.
[1:47:36] we read about him in Matthew chapter 9.
[1:47:40] different stages in Jesus
[1:47:44] we see these Disciples of John foreign
[1:48:04] Santo
[1:48:16] because you could only get that from
[1:48:18] Christ
[1:48:20] he he's the one that introduced the
[1:48:22] faith to the Christian Church
[1:48:31] he's the one that had the baptism that
[1:48:33] John talked about
[1:48:36] he's the one that held the mystery
[1:48:39] he's the one that held the king
[1:48:42] there's certain things that they could
[1:48:45] only get from Christ
[1:48:48] and if I could say this in Revelation
[1:48:50] chapter 10 is
[1:48:53] the Angel told John to go to the angel
[1:48:55] that held the book
[1:48:58] and it's and when John listened to that
[1:49:01] messenger
[1:49:03] he said go to the mighty angels
[1:49:06] and ask for the book
[1:49:09] but it's the mighty Angel
[1:49:11] this says take it and eat it
[1:49:14] it's only when Christ reveals it to
[1:49:16] hello
[1:49:34] Children of the life walk in the light
[1:49:37] and watch more on Full House
[1:49:41] they hadn't even heard of the Holy
[1:49:43] ghosts
[1:49:46] so now he starts to do the the
[1:49:48] dissecting and to say
[1:49:51] he said unto them under what then were
[1:49:53] you baptized
[1:49:56] he knew they were disciples
[1:49:59] it had some testimony
[1:50:02] they had some relationship to the to
[1:50:05] Christ
[1:50:07] they were like a cousin primo and so
[1:50:11] he's approached them as Believers
[1:50:15] have you received the promise
[1:50:18] promises to Believers
[1:50:21] so he's recognizing them as Believers
[1:50:25] which is how will you baptized
[1:50:31] then Paul said John barely baptized with
[1:50:33] the Baptist
[1:50:40] that they should believe on him which
[1:50:43] should come after him
[1:50:46] that is Kiss on Christ Jesus Christ
[1:50:51] Jesus that's the same message we've
[1:50:53] heard
[1:50:55] not that we would believe in William
[1:50:57] Branham
[1:50:59] we couldn't believe in him whom he
[1:51:01] preached
[1:51:02] that we would believe
[1:51:06] and these Disciples of John yes
[1:51:09] they had received
[1:51:11] they were Believers but they had not
[1:51:14] been attracted to the increase
[1:51:18] they didn't even know about the
[1:51:20] Vindication of John's Ministry
[1:51:23] of Juan
[1:51:25] that will repeat again
[1:51:29] said there will be a message that will
[1:51:31] introduce in my words the increase
[1:51:37] but the people will stumble at it
[1:51:42] and the sermon the world has fallen
[1:51:44] apart again
[1:51:47] and Jesus was the anointed word the word
[1:51:50] made flesh
[1:51:53] that's the reason he walked out into the
[1:51:55] water there foreign
[1:52:03] why did christ go to the Jordan River
[1:52:07] Jordan because that's where the Prophet
[1:52:09] was
[1:52:11] the word comes to the prophet is
[1:52:14] he was baptized by the
[1:52:18] propheta but remember in Matthew chapter
[1:52:20] 3
[1:52:23] John said Behold the Lamb of God Juan
[1:52:26] Diego
[1:52:27] that takes away the sins of the world
[1:52:30] but he didn't even understand what he
[1:52:32] said
[1:52:34] because when Jesus wants to be baptized
[1:52:43] he said then the prophet raised up
[1:52:45] said I must decrease he
[1:52:48] shall increase
[1:52:51] we find that that's God's way of doing
[1:52:54] it
[1:52:56] but did they receive it
[1:52:58] they should have known it
[1:53:01] they should have watched the acts of God
[1:53:06] they saw the word fulfilled
[1:53:10] they knew the scripture said what the
[1:53:12] scripture said about it
[1:53:15] but they couldn't believe it would come
[1:53:17] like that
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:35] then when he came on the scene he said
[1:53:40] I must decrease
[1:53:42] he must increase
[1:53:45] two of them couldn't stay at the same
[1:53:47] time
[1:53:50] John had to go
[1:53:53] Jesus remains Jesus
[1:53:56] it's always that way
[1:54:03] this is what brother Branham taught us
[1:54:06] that's God's way of doing it
[1:54:12] now if you look at Matthew Chapter 11
[1:54:19] not only am I going to try to preach
[1:54:21] what you already know
[1:54:25] I'm gonna try to do it in about an hour
[1:54:28] and make it even harder on the brothers
[1:54:36] Matthew chapter 11 math
[1:54:38] verses two to six
[1:54:41] now John is in prison
[1:54:45] and while John's in prison
[1:54:48] brother I'm talking about his ego I
[1:54:50] getting filmed over
[1:54:54] he had prophesied the Messiah Prophet is
[1:54:58] he had pointed to the Messiah
[1:55:01] he had affirmed the Vindication of the
[1:55:04] Messiah
[1:55:06] he had pointed his disciples back to the
[1:55:09] Messiah
[1:55:11] but now John is in prison
[1:55:14] and he sent two of his disciples
[1:55:18] he still has his disciples
[1:55:21] and said unto him
[1:55:23] or thou he that should come or do we
[1:55:26] look for another it is
[1:55:30] these are messengers that John sent
[1:55:34] and John is wrestling with things
[1:55:38] and he's questioning things
[1:55:41] and he wanted his disciples to ask
[1:55:46] are you the one that was to come after
[1:55:48] me it is
[1:55:54] what was supposed to be after my
[1:55:57] ministers
[1:56:02] Jesus answered and said to them
[1:56:05] God show John again those things which
[1:56:07] you do here and see
[1:56:11] the blind received their sights
[1:56:17] the lepers are cleansed Olympians
[1:56:23] and the poor have the gospel preached to
[1:56:25] them
[1:56:27] and blessed is he he said
[1:56:32] who shall ever not be offended in me
[1:56:36] and me
[1:56:38] John was offended
[1:56:41] John didn't fully understand what he was
[1:56:44] introducing
[1:56:47] John didn't know what he was even saying
[1:56:50] he believed he was the Messiah
[1:56:54] but he had his ideas of what the Messiah
[1:56:56] was to be foreign
[1:57:30] John was wrestling with it
[1:57:33] he had a lot of questions about it
[1:57:37] you know brother Branham had the same
[1:57:39] questions
[1:57:41] John was in prison
[1:57:44] and he sent these questions
[1:57:48] and then brother Branham preaches souls
[1:57:51] in prison now
[1:57:55] and he has a lot of questions
[1:58:00] what's going to happen is the door
[1:58:03] closing
[1:58:05] I'm not sure what this means
[1:58:07] I'm not sure what happens next
[1:58:11] but by the end of that year
[1:58:14] he knew the Vindication of his ministry
[1:58:18] he knew what that word was
[1:58:23] to look away to Jesus
[1:58:26] there's a man here who can turn on the
[1:58:28] line
[1:58:30] Shalom there's a son setting on the
[1:58:33] church
[1:58:37] Iglesia
[1:58:52] so as John was wrestling in prison
[1:58:56] blessed is he who shall not be offended
[1:58:58] in me he said
[1:59:01] brother Brandon called it the Forgotten
[1:59:03] beatitude
[1:59:04] [Music]
[1:59:06] never mind I read the clock wrong I'm
[1:59:08] going over an hour I think
[1:59:13] say what the tape says
[1:59:15] the believer can sit hour after hours
[1:59:24] you see we're just saying what he said
[1:59:26] do we have to do what he says
[1:59:29] and the Forgotten beatitude brother bam
[1:59:32] says in Avengers
[1:59:35] Jesus came and showed the Messiah he
[1:59:37] said Jesus
[1:59:38] that he was the Messiah
[1:59:41] but then something went wrong
[1:59:44] and introduced the Messiah
[1:59:48] with the fan in his hand
[1:59:51] going to burn up the chaff
[1:59:54] think about how John viewed his
[1:59:57] prophecies
[2:00:00] how John interpreted his own prophecies
[2:00:05] but he found out the works of Jesus
[2:00:09] he was making lowly
[2:00:12] so it worried him
[2:00:15] he didn't know what to say
[2:00:18] he thought now there's something wrong
[2:00:22] here somewhere
[2:00:24] Noir
[2:00:25] these are the thoughts of the prophets
[2:00:28] these are the thoughts of John is
[2:00:31] seemed he had believed the wrong thing
[2:00:36] it seemed like it wasn't working right
[2:00:41] what an incredible perception of what
[2:00:44] John was wrestling
[2:00:47] now brother Bradham gets Inside the Mind
[2:00:50] of John all right
[2:00:52] he says John thought
[2:00:54] well now I introduced a messiah that had
[2:00:57] a fan in his hand
[2:01:00] and he was going to purge the floors
[2:01:05] and take his week to the corner
[2:01:08] and I told them the ax was to to be laid
[2:01:12] to the root of the tree
[2:01:15] and he's going to take all the trash and
[2:01:17] burn it up
[2:01:19] and here he is instead of a Great Mighty
[2:01:22] Man like that
[2:01:26] here it comes meek and lowly
[2:01:30] something must have went wrong somewhere
[2:01:34] there's no doubt about but something's
[2:01:37] wrong somewhere
[2:01:43] he thought it wasn't right
[2:01:47] so not only did the Disciples of John
[2:01:51] have a hard time difficult but when the
[2:01:54] word was being made flesh in Christ
[2:01:57] even John had a hard time
[2:02:01] he looked at what he said
[2:02:04] and compared to what it was
[2:02:08] he says this isn't what I thought this
[2:02:10] meant
[2:02:13] and when his ego I got filmed over
[2:02:17] he said go and ask him
[2:02:20] he's the one
[2:02:22] should we look for another
[2:02:25] and Jesus's answer is
[2:02:28] that there's not another
[2:02:31] there's not an eighth messenger
[2:02:34] you know the inoculation to another
[2:02:37] Prophet
[2:02:39] the inoculation to an eighth messenger
[2:02:42] gospel
[2:02:45] is to recognize the one the seventh
[2:02:48] introduced
[2:02:54] he became dismayed like many of us do
[2:02:59] when we see things going on that isn't
[2:03:01] what we think is just right
[2:03:06] we become dismayed
[2:03:08] I want to say to you Believers tonight
[2:03:12] we should hunger and thirst to see the
[2:03:15] word Vindicated
[2:03:19] and not in some great Cathedral
[2:03:21] somewhere
[2:03:23] but in the humility
[2:03:26] and in the Simplicity
[2:03:28] of a life lived by the word
[2:03:31] nothing is out of order
[2:03:34] nothing is wrong
[2:03:40] let the critics range
[2:03:43] God's word is coming to pass
[2:03:47] the message is Alive and Well
[2:03:50] we should not be dismayed
[2:03:54] compados
[2:03:57] but it's only when we get our eyes on
[2:03:59] the prophet is
[2:04:05] when we get distracted by the decrease
[2:04:16] the coming of the Messiah was very
[2:04:18] simple
[2:04:20] and unexpected
[2:04:30] just gauging on how comfortable I can
[2:04:31] get tonight
[2:04:34] remember when brother Brandon's
[2:04:36] preaching the seals she said
[2:04:39] and he knows he can't say too much
[2:04:43] he even has it written in his notes
[2:04:46] you can't go further than this
[2:04:50] and he finds himself well you know
[2:04:54] it seems like
[2:04:56] and he says just keep living simple
[2:04:59] lives
[2:05:02] and he says you would think something
[2:05:04] like this would be revealed out of some
[2:05:07] great Cathedral somewhere else
[2:05:12] you think something like this would come
[2:05:14] to the Vatican
[2:05:16] commercial
[2:05:17] come to some great church
[2:05:20] but the word had to come to the prophet
[2:05:25] brother random in question and answers
[2:05:27] on the seal says it this way
[2:05:28] [Music]
[2:05:31] they had it all drought up
[2:05:34] this is what the prophet said
[2:05:37] this is what it's going to look like
[2:05:39] this is what John said is to look at he
[2:05:41] said what's going to look like they had
[2:05:43] it all drought up
[2:05:45] he will have a spear that will reach a
[2:05:48] mile long this is
[2:05:55] one of those white clouds
[2:05:59] and just pick up all these Romans
[2:06:05] just keep doing like that
[2:06:11] why they had that all fixed up
[2:06:15] notice how great they thought the
[2:06:17] manifestation would be
[2:06:21] in all their traditions and
[2:06:22] interpretations
[2:06:25] because then it was a little lamb come
[2:06:27] moving out amongst them
[2:06:35] pushed around this way in that way
[2:06:39] even John said
[2:06:42] go ask him
[2:06:45] is he actually the one
[2:06:48] brother I'm tying this together
[2:06:52] they had the prophecy all figured out
[2:06:56] and when it was fulfilled they rejected
[2:07:00] it
[2:07:02] when it happened
[2:07:03] they couldn't receive it because of
[2:07:06] their traditions because of their
[2:07:09] imagination
[2:07:10] because of their mental conception
[2:07:13] he says it was so humble
[2:07:17] till that prophet
[2:07:34] because God hides himself in Simplicity
[2:07:38] and let me share with you a secret
[2:07:42] wherever God hides that's where you'll
[2:07:46] find him
[2:07:47] if he's hidden Simplicity yeah
[2:07:55] and it was so humble that even John
[2:07:58] mistake
[2:08:04] that will repeat
[2:08:11] just as John Juan
[2:08:16] foreign
[2:08:28] the pattern ever Remains the Same El
[2:08:29] patronismo
[2:08:39] but Branham when he's preaching
[2:08:43] the bridge
[2:08:46] he connects John's Ministry
[2:08:49] of Juan with that of the ministry
[2:08:58] and he's reading in Revelations chapter
[2:09:00] 5.
[2:09:03] and the voice in Revelations chapter
[2:09:05] five
[2:09:08] says who is worth it open we say
[2:09:11] the book and loose the seals
[2:09:15] John said he wasn't even worthy to
[2:09:18] unloose the shoes of the Messiah
[2:09:22] so in the first coming in the worthiness
[2:09:26] of the Lamb
[2:09:29] part of the mystery being revealed
[2:09:32] I'm not even worthy to unloose the shoes
[2:09:35] but now when the Lamb's going to come
[2:09:38] forward to take the book
[2:09:40] The question is asked who's worthy to
[2:09:43] take the book and open it
[2:09:46] makes the statement Justice John is
[2:09:51] now brother Branham is looking at the
[2:09:53] mighty Angels
[2:09:55] who's coming back down to earth with the
[2:09:57] book open
[2:10:00] seventh angel
[2:10:02] S at the time of this coming
[2:10:04] up
[2:10:10] and here in Revelations chapter five
[2:10:14] the question is who's worth it
[2:10:17] but then brother Branham takes that
[2:10:19] phrase
[2:10:21] and he turns it around
[2:10:24] says he basically says this way
[2:10:28] it's not a question
[2:10:30] but it's an invitation
[2:10:33] it was well I wonder who's worthy
[2:10:43] no let him come and brother Branham says
[2:10:48] maybe I'm the only one feeling this way
[2:10:52] why did he say this because he's the
[2:10:56] angel
[2:10:57] he's the one to whom the word must come
[2:11:02] maybe I'm the only one feeling this way
[2:11:10] let him come and take the book and
[2:11:15] brother bear said and he came from
[2:11:20] beetle
[2:11:27] then what is it we're attracted to and
[2:11:33] Matthew 24
[2:11:37] one of the most pronounced scriptures in
[2:11:38] the ministry brother Branham is
[2:11:44] Luke 17
[2:11:46] in the day when the son of man is
[2:11:48] revealed
[2:11:51] we've seen the conditions
[2:11:57] we see it as it was in the days of Noah
[2:11:59] foreign
[2:12:18] did my time stop when the piano stopped
[2:12:21] I'm trying to I was given a time limit
[2:12:23] and I want to keep within us
[2:12:28] that's got everybody thinking right yeah
[2:12:33] are the pizza and wings ready
[2:12:37] I'm waiting for Deacon to say yeah
[2:12:44] in Luke 17 30 it says in the day when
[2:12:47] the son of man is revealed
[2:12:51] in the days of Life
[2:12:54] the days of Noah the gift of discernment
[2:12:58] those things were signs
[2:13:01] wanting to win the son of man is
[2:13:03] revealed
[2:13:04] manifestation
[2:13:06] remember Lot's wife
[2:13:10] and remembers Lord's wife
[2:13:13] that's not a rebuke to the bride
[2:13:17] she can never be lot's
[2:13:20] wife's wife started out as an overcomer
[2:13:25] he started out of Sodom because of the
[2:13:27] message
[2:13:29] but she had to turn around and go back
[2:13:33] so remember Lot's wife
[2:13:37] was a prophecy that there will be those
[2:13:44] Grupo
[2:13:54] [Music]
[2:14:08] and the revealing of the son of man in
[2:14:09] Luke 17 30.
[2:14:12] it's the same coming of the son Amanda
[2:14:14] Matthew 24 27.
[2:14:18] where's the lightning cometh out of the
[2:14:20] East and shine it even under the West
[2:14:22] this is
[2:14:26] also the coming of the son of man
[2:14:29] because
[2:14:34] but wheresoever the carcass is
[2:14:39] what body are you feeding on
[2:14:43] what body are we feeding us
[2:14:49] any other body is not going to give you
[2:14:51] strength to Fly Above denominations
[2:14:59] markers of denominations
[2:15:23] [Music]
[2:15:28] these scriptures are fulfilled
[2:15:33] where the carcass is
[2:15:36] where will the Eagles
[2:15:39] oh we have recognized the increase
[2:15:42] foreign
[2:15:55] that's where the Eagles are gathered
[2:15:57] together
[2:15:59] brother said that's what the attraction
[2:16:01] is
[2:16:07] the predestinated seed of God who can't
[2:16:09] do nothing else but follow it
[2:16:14] I'm not following this of my own shoes
[2:16:19] I'm attracted to it
[2:16:22] I'm drawn to it
[2:16:24] as he is being lifted up
[2:16:31] Prophet identifies Christ
[2:16:36] this is the revealed word
[2:16:39] this is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:16:43] I'm magnetized
[2:16:46] by the glory of it is
[2:17:02] let me keep my eyes on is
[2:17:11] we can't do it nothing else but follow
[2:17:12] it
[2:17:15] it means more than life to us
[2:17:20] but don't take that
[2:17:23] what is the attraction
[2:17:28] fulfilling his words
[2:17:33] we have a more sure word of Prophecy
[2:17:37] not just the prophecies
[2:17:40] but a more short word
[2:17:43] prophecy that has been interpreted by
[2:17:46] coming to pass
[2:17:48] that's been fully authenticated
[2:17:52] prophecy that's been
[2:18:18] [Music]
[2:18:24] is being spiritually revealed to me
[2:18:31] the Bible says that as many as were
[2:18:33] ordained to eternal life
[2:18:39] that word ordained could have been
[2:18:41] translated to addicted
[2:18:45] as many as we're addicted to eternal
[2:18:47] life
[2:18:50] when they heard the word of life
[2:18:55] that's what I want right there that's
[2:18:57] what I've been looking forward
[2:18:59] can you identify with it
[2:19:02] can I just use maybe a little harsh
[2:19:04] friend he doesn't realize it
[2:19:07] but you were born a word
[2:19:11] you were born addicted to this word
[2:19:15] and the only anything that'll satisfy
[2:19:19] Jesus Christ is the only thing
[2:19:24] our anxiety
[2:19:34] is all because of our distance
[2:19:46] brother Branham in the sermon God is his
[2:19:48] own interpreter
[2:19:51] he said it's not me
[2:19:55] it's the word promised for this day
[2:19:59] it's never been since the days of the
[2:20:01] Apostles
[2:20:06] it never has been
[2:20:08] doing things he ain't done for 1900
[2:20:10] years
[2:20:13] but where it was said
[2:20:16] and just before the coming of the son of
[2:20:18] man as it was in the days of life
[2:20:27] unbelievers don't believe it
[2:20:30] they're not expected to believe it
[2:20:33] okay but Believers believe it
[2:20:38] they can't do nothing else but Follow Me
[2:20:42] Do you believe it it's real real it's
[2:20:46] alive it's Vindicated we have been
[2:20:50] attracted to the increase
[2:20:52] you are the Vindication of the increase
[2:21:06] you're the one that sneaks after him
[2:21:10] or his body
[2:21:13] [Music]
[2:21:14] I'm so glad that the bride has been
[2:21:17] loose
[2:21:21] and we
[2:21:23] we are attracted to
[2:21:26] this is
[2:21:27] let us not be distracted by the decrease
