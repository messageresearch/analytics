into the message we'd like to give you a quick update I'd like to give you the trip we had to El Salvador I'll be saying a few words and our brother Galvez will be saying a few words and then brother luiso oh I'll say a few words and bring a message to you yesterday [Music] we first thank the Lord for being here once again it's good to be home casa it's good to go out and fellowship with the brothers in El Salvador buenos Salvador but first I'd like to mention that brother Eli is in Chandler China Church preaching this morning brother Marco Santana and Emmanuel Santos are in South Carolina [Music] and so let's keep them in prayer you know Mark 16 uh talks about the the Great Commission says to go out and preach the word preach the gospel so us as a church if we're capable of yes to go out and preach the word then then we should go out maybe we can help them or maybe they can help us but when we arrived at El Salvador we're actually there for about a week foreign the pastor there is Eduardo Gonzalez and the name of the church is foreign The Living Word of San Salvador they're the ones that invited us over there we were there for the 17th anniversary of the church and uh their Pastor their first pastor Pastor his name is brother Galvez the father of our brother Galvez he was a pastor for about 40 years and they've had many ministers visit them in the past visit they have a lot of history over there so it was an honor for us to be there to celebrate the 17th year of the church they're in now we were able to fellowship with them talk to the ministers there we received a few invitations to return we talked to other pastors from other countries there the countries are real small foreign so once again it's it's really good to fellowship with them so I don't know like we know when you have someone from out of town come into your church yes it creates a little excitement it creates a little Revival and uh it was good to be there uh brother Galvez he was our bodyguard our chauffeur he's the one that showed us around that's his hometown and we're privileged to know him Brothers God bless you Brothers I would just like to thank you for your prayers and I also want to thank the Lord for being able to take us and bring us back home safe my throat is a little sore it's like if I were to be preaching over there and my brother at least I preached every day came back like nothing that's the difference between the ages right but we do want to thank our pastor and brother Luis to be able to go and visit our our country where there is a group of people that love the fellowship and love the world and they love our brothers and then the most humble and simple way that they can do it they try to demonstrate the love towards our brothers and they send their greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in and just how they know us over here they we they know them over there as well because you preach something in the words of that we were written the pistols they might not know us but they know where we come from in the church that we this is so I won't take too much time so I could leave some time for brother Louise Paul said it was an honor and a privilege to be over there with them and be their bodyguard is and I want to thank the Lord because I know he took care of them but it did feel a lot of pressure to be able to take them and bring them back so when we arrived I think the door and I felt like a big burden fell off of my back is it's a great responsibility to be able to take servants over to a different country and and take care of them for them to be a blessing and to be able to enjoy the places over there so once again I want to thank you for your prayers and your support may the Lord bless each and every one of you God bless you Brothers [Music] so we're going to speak about a little bit about what happened over there in the country of Salvador um and the way that the fellowship had been created between us and the people from El Salvador as cuando of Julio was when we went in the month of June July Joy sorry um San Jose California there was a brother from San Jose California yesterday and this brother found a way to go back into his country is and our brother heard the testimony of our brother Marco Santana so when this brother was going to return back to his home he told them they you know he should invite brother Marcos to come is that was the dwarf open for us to be able to go and have fellowship with the people of Salvador yeah so in this last moments this past couple weeks so the church where our the father of our brother Galvez administered now the pastor that there is her brother he called us and he invited us to be able to attend the anniversary services that they were having he he is so we placed it in the hand and the Lord the Lord's hands and he opened up the way to be able to go so we arrived there February 9th on Thursday [Music] in the Church of our brothers he said the the word of the Living God so that Thursday we United at our sister's home of Galvez which is the mother of our brother galvezia they're the pastor United a couple of the youth there from church and the brother permitted us to be able to speak a couple of words unto the youth um to be able to help them in their journey and to be able to for their spiritual growth services and on Thursday or Friday was the the initiation of the special services we had it there at the local church and it fell in our lot to be able to preach the word and Saturday we had a youth service in the morning Salvador a lot of brothers from different areas around El Salvador United Guatemala we have some from Guatemala Hermanos Nicaragua we had some from Nicaragua tremendous and the most tremendous part was that originally Los Hermanos they only really rented the place out for a Sunday but after they saw that a lot of people were going to arrive Anton so the pastor who got in contact with the location and he told them that we might need or we need to rent the location out one day earlier and we'll pay whatever it's worth you know tremendous so and the most tremendous thing is that the people there didn't charge them a bit they only really charge them for Sunday they didn't charge them for a Saturday so we saw that God was opening up the way um [Music] and there was a young Minister there from Nicaragua that administered to the young people and likewise me as well I spoke to the youth Como Circle we had roughly around 105 young people there um and then on Saturday night our pastor brother ordone as he preached that night and I interpreted for him um the most tremendous thing was that our pastors that he had about 41 pages of notes and he didn't hardly use any one of them he was only speaking what the Holy Spirit was speaking and anointing them to say yeah so I would see in the hand of the Lord working through him and then on Sunday to speak again we had roughly about 200 people there yes and that was the first anniversary where the founding pastors the father of our brothers they were kind of felt a little sorrow in their heart to be there but they saw the hand of the Lord working pastor and by custom they're founding Pastor anniversario pastel every anniversary they would buy a cake and since the pastor wasn't there president Rolando they bought the cake that are that the brother really liked uh so it was a great privilege to be there amongst them yeah so after that we received a lot more invitations from different churches around the area and then on Tuesday we went to a church called The taberno Tabernacle of bethlehemas Calderon and the pastor there is a domination with along with our brother Galvez so they were both Elders so they were both two spies that opened up the way ayenne El Salvador in El Salvador uh so it was a great privilege to be among them is and in that church they have many musicians both brothers and sisters that play the violin Hermosa a very beautiful church and then on Wednesdays and we were invited to a church there in the capital of San Salvador like and the Tabernacle name is the voice of God El pastores and the pastor there is brother Ivan Cordova is a very beautiful congregation there yeah it's pretty small companies but it was a very clean fellowship and then on Thursday Julio we were there at the church where we were originally invited to back in July and the name of the church is the voice of the seventh angel Pastor Carlos Polanco and the pastor there is Carlos Polanco Alonso Pastor our pastor spoke Billboards uh Pastor spoke about the Billboards and I interpreted it for him and then I spoke a couple of words and we saw that the Lord came down in a tremendous way [Music] and we had a prayer line and just to close all this Julio when we went in the month of July there was a brother that had an issue with his bones he couldn't move when we went to visit him in his humble homes he was laying down and he couldn't move which is the brother that you see here in the in the pictures [Music] the privilege to pray for this brother so all the days that we were there he never rose up until the very last day when we were about to leave at the airport his brother sent me a video that he was already walking yes and that we showed in the last report that we did when we came back yet so in the back of my head or my mind I I kept thinking where is this brother was it that he got sick again and Anton says and by our surprise once we got to the city [Music] his wife invited us to go and have some soup with them is and the brother was there to receive us he was up and walking around and if the sister would continue with the photos here's the testimony of this product if you keep going there's our brother como como testimono as a testimony that prayer really works we see that the body can get sick he still has a little bit of shocks here and there in his body his spirit is healed is delivered and he's there as a testimony speaking and saying that the Lord has already healed them amen brothers please stand uh it was a privilege to be over there with her brother Jose and our pastor ordonos to be able to have that Fellowship um to be able to have a couple of laps and and be able to have Fellowship to be able to get to know each other a little bit more and I told our brother Jose is towards the end of the trip my brother Jose was a little bit sore from his throat as I told him brother you don't even preach one single day and just by hearing me you already got sore throat you're just going here left and right until you actually hit the mark is and it was a great privilege to be able to know those two brothers a little bit more and we're going to open up our scriptures and the brothers there from Salvador send their greetings the pastor Ramon Ivan and likewise the pastor brother Ivan is Carlos and Brother Carlos and all their congregations and their greetings [Music] so we're going to go to Luke 15 verse 11. before we uh read the scriptures we're going to Bow our heads and and do a quick prayer dear heavenly father the universe Lord we thank you for everything that you have given us for the privilege to be able to go and bring us back from Salvador Padres and now Lord we're here to be able to speak a little bit about your words father we pray that you clean our hearts yes [Music] and we subject ourselves under your power yoras and father we ask that you help us to be able to speak a little bit about your words in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen nice and Lucas so we can go to Luke 15 verse 11. he says and he said a certain man had two sons and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that fall that followeth to me yeah and he divided unto them his living and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into the far country and there wasted his substance with uh righteous righteous living you may be seated we're going to continue reading the scriptures hear the scripture that we're reading this morning it's a scripture that we know already as the lost son or The Prodigal Son the prophet speaks a lot about them so I would like to speak a little bit about this young man and the prophet speaks to us and the message the approach to God preached in 1955 the prophet says this way is okay pretty foreign [Music] the prophet says that's correct there's no hunger no I peligro there's no danger there's no trials sufferings nothing can separate us that is in Christ Jesus when you are truly born again and the prophet tells us that in every congregation there's three types of Believers there's the unbelievers there's the make-believer and there's a genuine belief and the prophet tells us that within the genuine believer there's two that they [Music] never went to the stage to be able to receive the holy ghosts that's why and sometimes we realize we feel that our batteries are going a little bit low yes was normal and that's normal but because there was a man that over there in Salvador did come up to me and approached me and he said brother I know that the prophet is a typologist I don't have here many people in the flesh family members does that mean that I won't have a family over there on the other side I told him look brother when you were born there was a father and a mother in order for you to be born here on this earth now when you are born again the prophet tells us we have a new father and we have a new mother Sangre we no longer have the blood of our last name we don't no longer have the DNA of our Earthly father and now we have the DNA Celestial of our heavenly father who is Our Father who is our mother when the disciples approached Jesus or the Pharisees I'm sorry they said we are the children of Abraham and Jesus said I know he never denied that they were the descendants of Abraham but he said if you were the children children of abrahamas you would do the same works as Abraham because looks just like his father acts like his father acts like his father and Jesus told them you are the sons of the devil so we see that when you are born again when someone be is able to uh be born again that is the beginning to be able to see to understand the kingdom of God because sometimes we want to start at the seventh step or the fifth but we must be born again our new mother and our new father but now the question is who is our mother it's God the word the word is our mother that's why we behave like and now every single one that's born again now he's my brother now she's my sister he is my brother Familia maybe here on Earth you might not have a big family maybe you're the only one in your family that accepted this message that believes this word but the moment that you are born again now you are inherited into a new family in the family of God amen brothers that is the reason why we when we go over to the past the curtain of time there is no more last names now we are all brothers and sisters from that which has been born again that's what the scripture says that who is flesh is the flesh it wasn't for the spirit is of the spirit when someone has genuinely been born again who can separate them from the love of God that Christian stands first between the tests and the torments the prophet says you can say I started out as a Christian once and then things started going this other way and that other way and then I started thinking I used to think that I was in a better conditions if you think that you're in a better condition before you met God you never came to God hermano my brothers if you once come truly to God and you begin to satisfy with the real gift of God participants of his divine nature you will never be able to be a sinner again you can never be the same person when you genuinely have tasted of the presence of the Lord the Lord has touched your heart it is very different for that person to go back into the world because now you have tasted of the things of God imagine a man eating from a trash can and then he comes into the home and then he eats on the table with steaks and then he says how can I ever return back into that if I've already tasted what is of God it is very difficult for that man to be able to return but if you know I don't want anything to do with it then you've never really genuinely come to God foreign [Music] one has to be born again that is the beginning amen now in the description of Saint Luke 15 when we read uh verse 13. we see that this man had two sons the prophet says that I don't know if it was the younger or the older but this young man yes he got tired of going to church if you think that the young people from the Biblical times we're different than the people of today they're the exact same thing the same character the same thoughts yes and this young man got tired of his father and mother telling him or taking them to church there came a certain pointers in his life that he wanted to be independent and he wanted his inheritance that belonged to him and he wanted to leave the his the house of his father now in verse 13. and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living this is the prophet says that perhaps this father had a great land and he had to sell it his son wanted his inheritance right then and there and then the father said you know son you already know you have been born in the message don't do this but the young man was already decided in his mind and then in verse 14. foreign and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in wants is and he went and joined himself into a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine so then you can see where this young man ended up well you might say this is just for the young people no this is something Universal foreign but he wanted to leave and then we see that he lost all of his goods and we see that we find them there with the pigs you can see how low a human being can go where he can go on without God he can go so low that he could be with the swine this is and then in verse 16. it is filled with his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him can you imagine how his father and mother must have felt they must say to each other we must keep praying foreign [Music] wasn't in his right mind why wasn't he in his right mind C why is it that he came back to him sometimes we find ourselves where we want to go back into the world we want to commit those errors again but then we turn back to ourselves and start asking ourselves what are we doing what am I doing here in the in the bars what am I doing here with my friendly worldly friends coming back to himself like if someone was asleep telling me about his testimony on a child of a pastor and I I see that he told me that he went out to the world maybe one day he can speak to that to us Cristiano he was doing something that a Christian or a son of a pastor shouldn't be doing he almost went out to the street he didn't even have a single Cent to be able to call his father and he said and he told me it came back to himself if I have a mother that's always cooking what am I doing here on the street amen Brothers [Music] sometimes that's how we feel coming back towards say what am I doing out here if I have very good prayers how many of my father's servants have abundance of my father and here I am hunger can you imagine this [Music] they would have meetings after meetings and conventions after conventions with a table full of food foreign the floor mat in the front door a genuine repentance because the scripture tells us that it repents when a person comes back to himself because when you realize that you are a child of God not when you were born here on Earth you were here a child of God you were one before the foundation of the world you were a child of God before yourself and maybe you got lost but then you heard the word of God and then the word of God and when you came back to yourself you were a child of God before the foundation coming back to yourself and when you heard the word and you came back you repented you no longer want to be the same person you don't want to be out in the bars you don't want to be doing the I'm not going to stay here and there we find the genuine repentance foreign that's why the prophet said that I don't believe in a dry eyed repentance when you genuinely repent is Savor the true love of God then you genuinely feel what love is more drinks aren't loved the world is not love yes God is love and then we see in verse 19. and I am no more worthy to be called yourself make me as one of your hired servants make me a formatter and came to his father but when he was yet a great way so then we see that his father saw him from afar this is that is a key word there is how we were far away from the word of God far from the grace of God there was no human being so right then and there the fellowship between man and God was separated now there was no more Fellowship between God now the only Fellowship that there was was between the priests but then the second Adam came along which his name was the Lord Jesus Christ and the scripture tells us that he reconciled us He restored that Fellowship between Gods now there's peace because man could not speak to God there was no Fellowship but the Lord Jesus Christ it was that each and every one of us that we may have fellowship with God that we can speak with God because of the blood through the blood the fellowship has been restored in the name of the Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost if you really want to know what the Lord Jesus Christ is receive that same spirit that was in him then you can have him in your heart because unto us is the promise there is the promise the gift of the Holy Ghost yes and it is for us oh so it's for me and for your children [Music] so it's not just only for me it's also for my kids for my grandkids for maybe my great grandchildren This Promise is for everyone all those that are far off and then in Ephesians 2 13. but now in Christ Jesus Us in other times which were far off have now been have been made and one time you were away from God but through the blood now we've made ourselves a lot closer closer to God and it is not of our words it is because of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and in Ephesians 2 17 and came and preached at peace unto you which were far off which were afar off he came and he preached the good news of peace peace between man and God because every time that God will look down and there was no blood God would get mad and repent that he ever made but when Jesus came and he was hung on the cross now there's peace between man and God when we were far off and now estamos we are now nigh Uno and now in Ephesians 2 1 . and you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in temp and time passed he walks so now we're speaking that in past times we were out lost in sin sigiendo la corre and just following the course of this world and when you see a river and together then you feel the stream pushing you but once you accept the Lord and you repent is it is very difficult it is not something easy it's something very difficult to go against the the world's course because here in the scripture says that according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air quality satanas which is the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in time passed in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and we're by Nature the children so then we see that by Nature the children of Wrath are the children of this world which is the reason why it is very important to be born again and if you feel that person if you feel the anger if you feel those things of the world then it is very necessary to be born again so then we see that we are lost Allah and just as Jesus he called him by his name he didn't say that right no he called the individual foreign hey Lord say road is High there's many errors but there's also Grace there's love there is forgiveness for a sinner there is Mercy for each and every one of us that wants to receive that Grace I don't want Justice I want Grace everybody wants Justice I want Mercy because if I want Justice the first one that wants justice but I want Mercy I don't want God to see how I am because I'm not worthy only the Lord Jesus Christ that's why this morning you have the opportunity you don't know if you're going to be dying tomorrow only God and then we see okay that along with him he resurrected us yes and he said else upon the Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Christ when Jesus suffered I know he has fulfilled the bride suffered when Jesus was crucified the bride was also crucified but when he rose a bride also Rose this is enough today this is before the foundation if you find yourself it is because of Grace that you are here the greatest mystery it's not the Mysteries now I like to hear them Stadium but the greatest mystery of all when you bring me a drunk person and now he's a preacher when you bring me a prostitute and now she's a lady Mysterio that is the greatest message when God changes the human heart that is the mystery that people cannot understand which is the reason why we must be born again to be able to understand the kingdom if I haven't been born again then I'm not a children of God because I must be born again for your father to be God and for your mother to be the word and now in closing and then the father saw him from far off and he was moved under mercy and Iran and he went and gave him the Holy Spirit so we see that the Lord is not going to protect us he's going to run towards us he wants to have more fellowship with you more than you want to have fellowship with him foreign so then we also see that he didn't even have any clothing but the father took out everything the best that he has what's the best and that's the Holy Ghost he gave us and the ring means signifies the marriage between man and God is and let's kill it so that we can let us eat because my son was dead and is alive again so then the word relief you see the word live so you can see that he was alive and then he died and now he's come back alive he's been risen again it was a Revival that he had okay because the prophet says [Music] is to revive what the individual is foreign that is the reason why the Revival is there is and now he and now he had been lost and now he is found your condition this morning brother and sister but we are here to preach you the good news is to be ready when the Lord [Music] you might have been in the message your whole life you might dress up but the main question is have you been born again have you received God's pardon have you received the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the question if you can please stand and the musicians come forward the opportunity for every single one of us is before us the mercy La Gracia Grace El Perron forgiveness is before every single one of us I don't deserve
