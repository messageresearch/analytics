[30:17] lord jesus
[30:21] we christ the musicians
[30:30] we're going to be reading from john
[30:32] vamos
[30:34] de juan
[30:47] john chapter 6
[30:49] verse 47 juan says
[30:53] verily verily i say unto you he that
[30:56] believeth on me has everlasting life
[31:08] your fathers did eat manna in the
[31:10] wilderness and are dead
[31:15] this is the prayer which cometh from
[31:17] heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[31:20] not die
[31:28] i am the living bread which came down
[31:30] from heaven if any man eat of this bread
[31:33] he shall live forever and the bread that
[31:36] i will give is my flesh
[31:39] which i
[31:41] will give for the
[31:43] life of the world
[31:58] themselves saying how can this man give
[32:01] us his flesh to eat entonces
[32:10] then jesus said unto them verily verily
[32:13] i say unto you except you eat the flesh
[32:15] of the son of man
[32:17] and drink his blood
[32:19] you have no life in you jesus
[32:30] who so eateth my flesh and drink of my
[32:32] blood hath eternal life and i will raise
[32:35] him up in the last days
[32:44] for my flesh is meat indeed
[32:47] and my blood is drink indeed
[32:54] he that eateth my flesh and drinking my
[32:57] blood dwelleth in me and i in him
[33:05] as the living father has sent me and i
[33:08] live by the father and he that eateth me
[33:11] even he shall live by me.
[33:22] this is that bread which came down from
[33:24] heaven not as your fathers did eat manna
[33:28] and are dead
[33:29] he that eateth of this bread shall live
[33:32] forever
[33:43] these things he said he in the synagogue
[33:46] as he taught them in capernaum
[34:01] we're going to speak a little bit on
[34:06] on the subject that brother brahan says
[34:08] is one of the most misunderstood uh
[34:12] topics there is in the in the bible
[34:30] and and i'd like to go over the plan for
[34:34] you
[34:35] [Music]
[34:38] since it will be our first time to have
[34:40] communion
[34:44] october 24th
[34:59] today is september 24th
[35:25] and the apostle paul
[35:28] is the one that set things in order in
[35:29] the new testament
[35:35] and he said in galatians 1 8.
[35:40] but the we or an angel from heaven
[35:43] preach any other gospel unto you that
[35:46] which
[35:47] we have preached unto you let him be a
[35:50] curse
[35:56] hello
[36:00] so the apostle paul knew what he was
[36:02] talking about
[36:06] he said things in order in the new
[36:07] testament
[36:12] as moses said things in order in the old
[36:14] testament
[36:19] now this message that i'm going to be
[36:20] speaking
[36:24] i took it from the message communion
[36:27] [Music]
[36:30] you can go back to it it's a very short
[36:32] message
[36:35] it's actually the last message brother
[36:37] brian preached the choice
[36:48] he says
[36:49] now i do believe that communion
[36:52] what is called communion now is the
[36:55] lord's supper all right
[37:03] now we have we now we only have three
[37:06] physical divine orders left to us
[37:14] one of them is communion
[37:19] washing
[37:24] three things that the lord told us to do
[37:29] it's perfection is perfection there's
[37:32] only three orders we have
[37:43] [Music]
[37:47] no one should take communion if they're
[37:49] not prepared to take it
[37:55] that's why we want to do it 30 days from
[37:57] now foreign
[38:06] now the first thing
[38:07] is
[38:08] baptism
[38:12] brother braham said in another message
[38:17] that if you're not prepared he would
[38:19] stop you from taking communion
[38:27] he actually said he would stop him from
[38:29] taking communion or keep him from
[38:40] it's extremely important it's uh
[38:43] extremely important so first let's talk
[38:46] about baptism
[38:50] baptism
[38:51] you have to accept the lord jesus christ
[38:53] as your personal savior
[38:58] personally you have to accept that you
[39:00] were born in sin come in this world
[39:02] speaking lies us
[39:07] and there was a savior to keep you from
[39:09] going to hell
[39:14] you accept the lord jesus christ as your
[39:16] personal savior
[39:20] personally and because of that works
[39:22] that's gone in has happened within you
[39:37] [Music]
[39:40] you're dying to yourself
[39:43] and you want the lord jesus christ to be
[39:45] your new guy
[39:49] you're promising the lord that you'll
[39:50] serve him
[39:51] [Music]
[39:54] that's
[40:08] to serve the lord
[40:10] he wants people to serve them
[40:14] and the way he finds out if you love him
[40:17] if you want to serve him
[40:23] [Music]
[40:42] you'll constantly be
[40:45] on your knees asking the lord to help
[40:47] you you say constantly
[41:13] when someone comes before you and gives
[41:16] you a hard time
[41:43] [Music]
[41:46] front
[41:49] and told someone
[41:51] because
[41:52] pressure got really high
[41:56] and i gave him a hard time
[41:59] but i realized i was out of order
[42:07] apologize for them
[42:13] that doesn't make you fall
[42:31] okay
[42:32] now let's let's go into the more of the
[42:34] symbols
[42:41] and we have communion
[42:44] let's go into the actual uh process
[42:49] [Music]
[42:51] then once we have that process in mind
[42:55] we'll go into the what brother branham
[42:58] says about how important it is to be
[43:02] ready for it
[43:08] now communion you can trace it all the
[43:10] way back to melchizedek
[43:15] okay but we won't go there
[43:18] but what communion is
[43:22] the actual
[43:24] processor there's a there's a bread that
[43:27] is made
[43:30] there's a certain way that the bread is
[43:31] made
[43:35] i have a sister
[43:38] and i already talked to her you have le
[43:40] conair and i asked her to prepare the
[43:42] bread for us
[43:46] i asked her to take two or three sisters
[43:51] that are filled with the holy scholar
[44:19] and we want her to train our young
[44:21] ladies
[44:24] our young sisters
[44:27] when the bread is made
[44:30] and is kept out in the back yes
[44:33] either in the office
[44:36] or the fellowship hall oh
[44:38] company
[44:40] we also buy uh
[44:42] wine
[44:43] compramos vino and i asked the brother
[44:46] to
[44:47] take care of that yeah
[44:51] he's going to be buying the wine there's
[44:52] actually wine that is made for that
[44:55] [Music]
[45:00] and we also need to buy
[45:02] other products that we need to serve the
[45:05] wine with tamien
[45:11] now
[45:12] the people that actually
[45:15] uh
[45:16] hold the bread
[45:21] the ones that will be breaking the
[45:23] breath
[45:25] are our church elders
[45:29] church elders that are filled with the
[45:44] and then they come forward
[45:48] exactly how we're going to do it
[45:53] we have to go over with the elders
[45:58] well probably have a table here lomas
[46:01] probably
[46:03] we'll have the bread
[46:07] and we'll have two to four elders
[46:11] to be serving it
[46:54] and the men go to the fellowship halls
[46:59] to do the feet
[47:03] everyone brings their towel
[47:07] and
[47:08] the first person they see the person
[47:12] they wash their feet
[47:16] they
[47:17] pray over
[47:18] [Music]
[47:20] the persona as they're washing their
[47:22] feet allah
[47:37] and
[47:38] everyone gets to go home
[47:41] it will be on a sunday evening
[47:45] there'll be no fellowship then
[47:48] everybody goes home
[48:05] amen
[48:06] now who can take this
[48:08] uh communion all right
[48:12] who can who can do this
[48:16] anybody that comes
[48:25] and this is how important this is
[48:29] important
[48:30] okay let's get into the brother
[48:34] [Music]
[48:40] now when we talk
[48:42] now when we take this communion it isn't
[48:45] just the thing saying i'm coming up here
[48:49] and going to eat some bread
[48:51] i believe i'm a christian but if you
[48:54] notice the bible said he that eateth
[48:57] and drink it
[48:59] unworthily
[49:00] shall be guilty of the blood and the
[49:04] body of the lord see
[49:06] you've got to live a life
[49:10] that before the people that
[49:12] and before god and
[49:42] you've got to live a life that the
[49:46] people
[49:47] than before god and the people that
[49:51] shows that you are
[49:53] that you are sincere
[50:11] de pretension or engano a genuine
[50:15] feeling
[50:18] heartfelt
[50:19] del corazon
[50:21] now just a moment longer now i'm in the
[50:25] old testament
[50:26] when the sacrifice was made
[50:29] a statute
[50:30] or an ordinance
[50:41] and so is water baptism and ordinance
[50:48] so is feet washing an ordinance
[50:53] so is the lord's supper and ordinance
[50:59] blessed is he that does all of his
[51:02] ordinance
[51:03] keeps all of his statues and all of his
[51:06] commandments that he might have a right
[51:11] to enter into the tree of life
[51:26] amen
[51:28] now notice in this now that
[51:30] in that the first
[51:33] when it was
[51:34] first an ordinance of god to bring a
[51:38] sacrifice to the church
[51:41] and the temple and the altar
[51:45] and offer your gift
[51:47] and for your sins the sacrifice of a
[51:51] lamb
[52:11] when i can just imagine seeing some
[52:13] jewish brother coming down the road
[52:15] knowing that he was guilty
[52:18] and he goes to the altar or brings a his
[52:21] fat
[52:22] ox or a bullock or whatever he had or a
[52:27] ram
[52:28] a lamb something
[52:47] he had brought it down the road just as
[52:50] sincere as he could come he walked up
[52:54] there keeping god's ordinance
[52:57] just as sincere as he
[53:12] then he laid his hands upon it
[53:15] confessing his sins
[53:17] and the priests placing this his sins
[53:20] upon the lamb and the lamb's throat was
[53:24] cut
[53:25] and then he died for
[53:43] or whatever he had or a ram a lamb
[53:46] something he had brought it down
[53:49] the road just as sincere as he could
[53:52] come he walked up there keeping god's
[53:55] ordinance
[53:56] just as sincerely as he could hold
[54:14] finally over and over and when again and
[54:17] over and over kept going until finally
[54:19] it became a tradition finalemente
[54:42] [Music]
[54:52] this has to be done with sincerity
[54:57] the commandment of god became a
[55:00] tradition to the people and then here he
[55:03] come down well let's see this is so and
[55:06] so today maybe i better go yeah down
[55:12] the tradition
[55:17] is
[55:21] yeah i better offer a bullock he went
[55:24] down well lord here's my biloxi there's
[55:28] no sincerity
[55:30] in it there's no understanding
[56:13] has to be a revelation
[56:17] has to be an understanding
[56:23] you're saying for service
[56:28] you're safe to provide a service us
[56:33] service to help someone else
[56:37] to help but
[56:40] we always need help in the church
[56:42] siempre ocopamos
[56:48] now we find out today that this great
[56:51] thing that we're fixing to do tonight in
[56:54] the commemoration of his death and his
[56:56] body that we believe that we eat daily
[57:00] or just go through eating as our brother
[57:03] preached to us
[57:20] taking the word of god we believe it
[57:23] with all our hearts
[57:28] we see it manifested
[57:31] manifesto we see it giving to us
[57:36] we see it vindicated
[57:43] and we must come to this with a deep
[57:47] conscience
[57:48] of what we're doing not because it's an
[57:51] order either
[58:06] you don't take the lord's supper by
[58:08] tradition
[58:12] you take it because it's the love of god
[58:15] in your heart
[58:20] in keeping the commandments of god
[58:25] see that's what you take it foreign
[58:37] so if you don't take it sincerity
[58:40] just as a tradition
[58:46] well our church observes communion once
[58:49] every sunday or every month or twice a
[58:51] year or go up and say well it's my time
[58:55] and then take the communion why it's a
[58:58] stink
[59:00] to god
[59:01] see
[59:02] that's
[59:11] [Music]
[59:28] something that is not done just
[59:30] as another day
[59:34] come on
[59:53] let's skip to 54.
[59:58] then when we come to the lord's table we
[1:00:01] must come in reverence
[1:00:04] love
[1:00:05] and respect
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:21] look where we would have been
[1:00:24] if it hadn't been for him the
[1:00:32] we come here thinking well if i hadn't
[1:00:34] known
[1:00:35] the lord where would i be
[1:00:39] you know
[1:00:49] i'm having communion
[1:00:59] and if you know brother
[1:01:03] let me
[1:01:04] go back here
[1:01:07] 55 there's paul i think in saying this
[1:01:11] wherefore when ye come together to eat
[1:01:14] tarry one for the other
[1:01:19] cinco por lo tanto pablo yo
[1:01:22] por
[1:01:29] other words just wait a few minutes
[1:01:40] if you know a brother is in there just
[1:01:43] about to do something wrong
[1:01:46] or something
[1:01:47] and you pray for him
[1:01:58] one the other wait just a minute pray if
[1:02:03] there's any feelings between you or
[1:02:07] something
[1:02:08] don't
[1:02:09] do it
[1:02:10] don't do it go make that
[1:02:13] right first see
[1:02:16] go straighten that up first
[1:02:38] because we want to come here just as
[1:02:40] pure as we can be
[1:02:42] in our thoughts of one another and to
[1:02:46] god and to each other and then we come
[1:02:49] in fellowship
[1:02:50] around the table of the lord
[1:03:00] condos
[1:03:15] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:03:19] man and drink his blood
[1:03:21] you have no life in you
[1:03:30] except you eat the flesh of the blood
[1:03:34] except you eat the flesh of the son of
[1:03:37] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:03:40] in you el que no coma la carne
[1:03:46] how important is that
[1:03:50] see you see what's that's what the bible
[1:03:53] said except you do it
[1:03:55] there's no life in you you see
[1:04:00] this
[1:04:06] you are then showing
[1:04:07] you are then
[1:04:09] more or less showing you are ashamed to
[1:04:13] identify yourself
[1:04:15] as a christian
[1:04:16] because of the life that you live us
[1:04:30] [Music]
[1:04:36] then if you don't do it you have no life
[1:04:41] if you do it unworthily you are guilty
[1:04:44] of the body of the lord
[1:04:51] indignant
[1:04:59] then if you don't do it you have no life
[1:05:04] if you do it
[1:05:06] if you do do it
[1:05:08] unworthily you are guilty
[1:05:12] of the body of the lord
[1:05:21] that's the trouble of us today
[1:05:24] what i think i'm saying
[1:05:26] us
[1:05:27] me and the church that the lord god has
[1:05:30] sent me
[1:05:31] speak
[1:05:32] to in these last hours that we believe
[1:05:36] were in the closing time
[1:05:39] problem
[1:06:08] we must come to him with reverence and
[1:06:11] with love
[1:06:12] and with purity of heart
[1:06:16] mind and soul
[1:06:25] that's a that's pretty tough huh can you
[1:06:29] we have to do things right
[1:06:34] communion and feet washes isn't
[1:06:36] something lightly
[1:06:41] you really have to consider the life you
[1:06:43] live
[1:06:53] it can affect the rest of your
[1:06:58] life first corinthians 11 24.
[1:07:07] see what paul the apostle paul tells the
[1:07:09] corinthians about this
[1:07:11] question
[1:07:19] and we had given thanks
[1:07:21] he broke it and he said take heed this
[1:07:25] is my body which is broken for you this
[1:07:28] do in remembrance of me
[1:07:40] after the same manner also he took up he
[1:07:44] took the cup when he had soup saying
[1:07:48] this cup is a new testament
[1:07:50] in my blood this do ye ass up as you
[1:07:55] drink it in remembrance of me
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:15] drink this cup you do show the lord's
[1:08:17] death till he comes
[1:08:22] is
[1:08:31] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:08:36] and drink this cup of the lord
[1:08:40] unworthily
[1:08:41] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:08:45] the lord
[1:08:50] your
[1:08:56] let a man examine himself
[1:09:00] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:09:03] drink of that cup
[1:09:11] for he that eat it and drink it
[1:09:13] unworthily eat it and drinking damnation
[1:09:17] to himself
[1:09:18] not discerning the lord's body
[1:09:29] for this cause many are weak
[1:09:32] and sickly among you and many sleeps
[1:09:41] for if we would judge ourselves we would
[1:09:43] not be judged
[1:09:50] but when we are judged we are shasta of
[1:09:53] the lord
[1:09:54] we that we should not be condemned with
[1:09:58] the world
[1:09:59] just
[1:10:00] castigator
[1:10:05] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:10:07] together to eat
[1:10:09] tarry one for the other
[1:10:12] que hermanos cuando ronis ami
[1:10:18] if any man hunger let him eat
[1:10:21] at home that ye come not together unto
[1:10:25] condemnation
[1:10:27] and the rest will be will will i set an
[1:10:31] order when i come
[1:10:32] success
[1:10:43] this is the last paragraph of brother
[1:10:45] branham
[1:10:49] communion
[1:10:51] uh 1965 1212. in mensah communion
[1:10:58] remember when israel taken the type of
[1:11:02] this
[1:11:03] they journeyed 40 years in the
[1:11:06] wilderness and their clothes never even
[1:11:08] wore out
[1:11:10] and they come out without one feeble one
[1:11:14] one
[1:11:15] among them with two million people as a
[1:11:18] type of this
[1:11:23] academy podesta
[1:11:37] well
[1:11:39] what will the anti-type do
[1:11:42] if the body
[1:11:43] of a sacrificial animal did that for
[1:11:47] them
[1:11:48] what would the body of jesus christ
[1:11:50] emanuel do for us
[1:11:54] [Music]
[1:12:09] let us just be reverent when we come
[1:12:13] let us be just as reverent as we know
[1:12:17] how to come
[1:12:18] us
[1:12:35] there's a little bit more here
[1:12:39] and i haven't seen it
[1:12:43] where brother brahim refers to this
[1:12:49] but i know we we used to read it
[1:12:54] and uh
[1:12:55] when we would take communion
[1:13:00] i'll read it to you
[1:13:03] and i'll explain it to you
[1:13:06] first samuel 21-1
[1:13:14] remember i don't know everything
[1:13:36] then came david unto noah
[1:13:39] the himalay
[1:13:41] the priests
[1:13:43] and himalay was afraid at the meeting of
[1:13:46] david
[1:13:47] and said unto him why are thou alone
[1:13:51] and no man with thee.
[1:14:07] the priests
[1:14:08] the king hath commanded me a business
[1:14:12] and had said unto me let no man know
[1:14:15] anything of the business we're about i
[1:14:19] send thee and what i have commanded thee
[1:14:22] and i have appointed my servants to such
[1:14:25] in such a place
[1:14:43] now therefore what is under thine hand
[1:14:46] give me five loaves of bread in my hand
[1:14:50] of what there is present
[1:14:54] amano
[1:14:58] and the priest answered david and said
[1:15:00] there is no common bread under my hand
[1:15:03] but there is hollowed bread
[1:15:06] if the young men have kept themselves at
[1:15:08] least
[1:15:09] from women
[1:15:22] alone and david answered the priest and
[1:15:26] said unto him of a truth
[1:15:29] woman have been kept from us
[1:15:31] these three days
[1:15:33] since i came out and the vessels of the
[1:15:36] man young men are holy and the bread is
[1:15:41] in a manner common yay
[1:15:44] though it were sanctified this day in
[1:15:47] the vessel
[1:15:57] [Music]
[1:16:04] so the priest gave him hallowed bread
[1:16:07] for there was no bread there but the
[1:16:10] show bread
[1:16:11] that was taken from before the lord
[1:16:14] to put hot bread in the day when it was
[1:16:17] taken away quantum
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:42] how many remember the scripture
[1:16:44] recorded
[1:16:50] it's kind of hard to explain but in
[1:16:52] reality it's really simple is difficult
[1:16:59] you keep
[1:17:01] separate from your husband or your wife
[1:17:05] for three days before you have communion
[1:17:14] it makes
[1:17:14] sense okay
[1:17:20] just have a few more and and we'll be
[1:17:22] done
[1:17:26] i don't think this is on the
[1:17:28] slide
[1:17:35] this is just to
[1:17:36] to
[1:17:37] emphasize
[1:17:39] how important it is to be
[1:17:43] to be right with god yes
[1:17:50] i had several other scriptures or texts
[1:18:02] [Music]
[1:18:05] we realized that the scripture that we
[1:18:08] have read
[1:18:09] that if we eat and drink unworthily
[1:18:13] we're eating and drinking damnation to
[1:18:16] ourselves
[1:18:18] not discerning the lord's body
[1:18:34] that is if you're living in sin
[1:18:38] living where you're not when you should
[1:18:41] not live
[1:18:43] then you are a reproach to the cause
[1:18:52] of
[1:19:06] but you're living
[1:19:08] if
[1:19:10] but if you're living i know every one of
[1:19:12] us makes mistakes
[1:19:15] but we have a blood sacrifice laying
[1:19:18] there atoning for us constantly
[1:19:22] the blood of god's own son
[1:19:33] constantly
[1:20:00] but if you're living in open sin and not
[1:20:04] worthy to be called a christian don't
[1:20:07] take it
[1:20:17] but if you are a christian
[1:20:19] then you're duty-bound to take it
[1:20:27] for he that eats my flesh and drinks my
[1:20:32] [Music]
[1:20:43] amen
[1:20:46] now what's a type the the wine is a type
[1:20:49] and the bread is the type
[1:20:55] okay i hold in my hand a grape juice
[1:21:04] the blood
[1:21:06] of the grape that
[1:21:08] jesus said i will drink a new with you
[1:21:10] in my father's kingdom
[1:21:19] this represents
[1:21:22] the blood of jesus christ
[1:21:25] that our sins are forgiven
[1:21:32] gracious god as i hold in this my hand
[1:21:37] tonight the grapes the blood of the
[1:21:40] grapes that's to represent the blood of
[1:21:44] the son of god
[1:21:53] representatives
[1:21:56] as i ask you to bless it to every
[1:21:59] partaker may our sins be under the blood
[1:22:05] participate
[1:22:08] may our sickness vanish from us
[1:22:14] for we are your servants desiring strong
[1:22:18] healthy bodies and clean pure heart and
[1:22:21] conscience that we can be your
[1:22:23] representatives in this earth
[1:22:36] representative
[1:22:38] we pray thee our god to sanctify these
[1:22:42] grapes
[1:22:43] tonight the blood of these graves
[1:22:46] to its intended purpose in the name of
[1:22:49] jesus christ
[1:23:03] the scripture says that he took the cup
[1:23:06] and gave thanks then he took the bread
[1:23:09] and he broke it and said this is my body
[1:23:12] which is broken for you
[1:23:16] gracias it is
[1:23:24] as i hold in my hand tonight these
[1:23:26] little parcels of bread that that's all
[1:23:30] wrinkled up broke up it reminds me of
[1:23:34] the message tonight how they beat one
[1:23:37] tree to get the pope out to save the
[1:23:40] other
[1:23:41] sustain
[1:23:46] vienna
[1:23:57] and how he was
[1:23:59] wounded for our transgressions
[1:24:02] bruised for our iniquities and
[1:24:04] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:24:07] but with his stripes we were healed
[1:24:14] of
[1:24:25] may the grace of god sanctify this
[1:24:28] kosher bread to its intended purpose to
[1:24:31] every person that partakes of it
[1:24:34] no more sin in your life no more
[1:24:36] sickness in your body till we meet the
[1:24:39] lord
