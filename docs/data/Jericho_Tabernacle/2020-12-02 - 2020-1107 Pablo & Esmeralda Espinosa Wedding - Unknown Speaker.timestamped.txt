[15:22] thank you very much you may be seated
[15:39] these two persons
[15:43] i believe we have a beautiful scene
[15:45] before us
[15:49] the natural types of spiritual natural
[15:52] typical spiritual
[16:04] and that is the bride of jesus christ
[16:35] they're about to exchange their vows
[16:41] and they're very proud and glad today
[16:44] yes that you can come and witness what
[16:48] they will
[16:49] speak to you and say that they will
[16:51] confess
[16:56] their confession one to another they
[16:59] they love each other
[17:02] and we understand we know that the a
[17:05] perfect marriage
[17:06] is three matrimonial perfecto
[17:13] and that is god man
[17:16] and
[17:28] i'm going to go in to read a few
[17:30] scriptures here
[17:34] that is the basis of doing this and
[17:37] letting everybody know what
[17:39] is going to take place here today
[17:56] do it all in the name of the lord jesus
[17:58] christ
[18:10] and marriage belongs in the house of god
[18:42] therefore shall a man leave his father
[18:44] and his mother
[18:49] and shall cleave unto his wife
[18:52] and they shall be one flesh
[19:20] as the husband subjects himself to god
[19:25] then everything runs in harmony
[19:28] and we have a lot less friction
[19:32] now mark 10 6.
[19:35] but from the beginning of the creation
[19:37] god made made them male and female
[19:43] for this cause shall a man leave his
[19:44] father and his mother and cleave to his
[19:46] wife
[19:51] and they twain shall be one flesh
[19:55] so that they are no more twain but one
[19:57] flesh
[20:00] wherefore what god has joined together
[20:03] let no man put us under
[20:20] but the whoremongers and adulterers god
[20:22] will judge
[20:26] ephesians 5 22 and 27.
[20:31] wives submit yourself unto your husbands
[20:34] your own husband
[20:38] yes unto the lord for the husband is
[20:41] ahead of the wife
[20:44] even as christ is the head of the church
[20:52] therefore as the church is subject unto
[20:54] the church
[20:58] so let the wise speak to their own
[21:00] husbands and everything
[21:04] husbands love your wives
[21:09] i would like to ask you a question pablo
[21:12] do you love her llamas yes
[21:26] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[21:28] with the washing of the
[21:41] not having a spot or wrinkle or any such
[21:43] things
[21:48] but it should be holy and without
