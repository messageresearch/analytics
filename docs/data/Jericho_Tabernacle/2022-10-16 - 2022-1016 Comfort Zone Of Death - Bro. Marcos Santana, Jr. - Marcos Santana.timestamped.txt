[1:00:11] go over my time
[1:00:14] but uh we're gonna try and go on a
[1:00:17] little trip this morning
[1:00:20] and something that really blessed me
[1:00:24] I opened my eyes to the scriptures a
[1:00:27] little bit more for me
[1:00:30] and I pray that the Lord can do the same
[1:00:33] for every one of you this morning
[1:00:37] I wanted to continue on the topic of
[1:00:41] agape love
[1:00:44] and last night those things went left
[1:00:47] and they went a different direction
[1:00:52] but we're going to title the message
[1:00:55] today
[1:00:57] the comfort zone of death
[1:01:00] I don't want anyone to get scared this
[1:01:03] morning
[1:01:05] but just just trust in our Lord God
[1:01:07] Almighty confidence
[1:01:10] if you are of him
[1:01:12] then he's got your back this morning
[1:01:17] let's use the scripture we've been
[1:01:18] taking for example love
[1:01:22] and we're going to just read Matthew 22
[1:01:25] 37.
[1:01:29] if you could say Amen when you have it
[1:01:34] amen
[1:01:37] Matthew 22 37.
[1:01:42] and Jesus said unto him
[1:01:45] Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
[1:01:48] all thy heart with all thy soul and with
[1:01:50] all thy Minds
[1:01:56] I don't think it gets more and more
[1:01:59] easily explained than that
[1:02:02] that's my everything
[1:02:06] that's all my mind that's all my heart
[1:02:10] and I'm gonna love him with every single
[1:02:13] bit of it
[1:02:15] let's bow our heads for prayers
[1:02:18] Lord Heavenly Father Celestial we love
[1:02:22] you this morning Lord
[1:02:24] we wouldn't be here if we didn't love
[1:02:26] you Lord
[1:02:27] we just want to hear a little bit more
[1:02:29] of your word this morning
[1:02:32] you can reveal just as more portion of
[1:02:35] your word this morning
[1:02:38] Father put me in my interpreter aside
[1:02:42] and you'll be the one speaking to your
[1:02:44] people this morning
[1:02:47] take this simple theme this morning
[1:02:51] and amplify it in the hearts of your
[1:02:53] children today
[1:02:57] we give you all the honor and Glory
[1:03:01] Gloria and we put our trust in you this
[1:03:03] morning

[1:03:08] pray amen
[1:03:10] [Music]
[1:03:12] you may be seated Brothers
[1:03:15] thank you for bearing with me
[1:03:19] like I said this morning uh the title is
[1:03:22] uh comfort zone of death
[1:03:25] is
[1:03:29] somewhere where I don't think anybody
[1:03:31] any one of us would ever want to be in
[1:03:35] but if we can turn to the scriptures in
[1:03:39] John 12 verse 3.
[1:03:43] and I might be going a little quickly
[1:03:46] this morning
[1:03:48] so if if you need to you can just follow
[1:03:51] along on the screen
[1:03:53] but I want to just go through an entire
[1:03:56] story today
[1:03:59] and and we're going to start right here
[1:04:01] in John 3 John 12 verse three
[1:04:06] says then Mary then took Mary a pound of
[1:04:09] ointment of spikner very costly and
[1:04:12] anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his
[1:04:14] feet with her hair and the house was
[1:04:16] filled with the odor and the ointment
[1:04:23] Jesus is
[1:04:29] one of the disciples Judas is scary
[1:04:32] Simon's son which should betray him
[1:04:40] why was not this ointment sold for 300
[1:04:43] Pence and given out to the poorest
[1:04:48] so here we have this woman married
[1:04:52] he was about to anoint Jesus
[1:04:56] to perform a service to Jesus
[1:04:59] and it said it puts a cost to this oil
[1:05:05] this all happens to be a very very very
[1:05:08] expensive oil
[1:05:12] and then it tells us about that
[1:05:14] character we know
[1:05:22] why don't you sell this and give it to
[1:05:24] the poor instead
[1:05:29] why are you wasting it on this
[1:05:32] now my question is who is Judas is I
[1:05:37] think it's not so much the question who
[1:05:39] is he
[1:05:41] but the issue is that we already know
[1:05:43] who he is
[1:05:46] because we've read the story
[1:05:49] you know the book we know what happens
[1:05:52] at the end of that story
[1:05:55] We Know What Judas became
[1:05:58] and then how it was that he failed
[1:06:01] but have we seen what and who Judas was
[1:06:04] at that
[1:06:09] momentum he was hand-picked by Jesus
[1:06:11] Christ
[1:06:14] out of everyone here he said Judas I
[1:06:17] need you as my disciple
[1:06:22] there was good traits good qualities
[1:06:25] about this man Judas
[1:06:28] that he was needed in the ministry of
[1:06:31] Jesus and the disciples
[1:06:35] even the book of Acts
[1:06:38] it says when speaking about Judas
[1:06:41] that he was numbered with us
[1:06:45] the 12 of us
[1:06:47] and he obtained his part of the ministry
[1:06:52] so he performed in the ministry
[1:06:55] he had his part in that Ministry
[1:06:59] and he was identified as a disciple
[1:07:03] clean he was a Believer
[1:07:06] it was an upstanding Apostle right at
[1:07:09] that
[1:07:12] momentum more than just that he was
[1:07:24] the treasurer of that church the
[1:07:27] treasurer of that Ministry
[1:07:30] so I can only imagine that the other 11
[1:07:33] disciples
[1:07:36] they already had a sense of trust in
[1:07:39] Judas
[1:07:41] a confidence in his character and who he
[1:07:43] was
[1:07:48] and then when they see that Jesus gives
[1:07:51] him the money back and the the
[1:07:52] responsibility of a Treasurer
[1:07:56] responsibility well they only trust him
[1:07:59] even more
[1:08:02] but because Jesus had him as a treasure
[1:08:07] he had to keep him close
[1:08:10] right by his side working together
[1:08:13] because he trusted him so
[1:08:24] it sounds funny but it was Judas
[1:08:29] because we know who he was
[1:08:32] and what he was going to do
[1:08:35] if we can go to that moment in time
[1:08:41] if we turn over to Mark 14.
[1:08:45] and verse
[1:08:47] continuing the same story but from a
[1:08:50] different gospel
[1:08:54] it says and being in Bethany in the
[1:08:57] house of Simon the leper as he sat at me
[1:09:00] there came a woman having an alabaster
[1:09:03] box of ointment of spikenard very
[1:09:05] precious and she break the box and
[1:09:08] poured it on his head is
[1:09:26] verse forces and there were some that
[1:09:28] had indignation within themselves and
[1:09:31] said why was this await why was this
[1:09:34] waste of the ointment made
[1:09:43] now this scripture says there were some
[1:09:47] but the other specifies it was Judas
[1:09:51] so it sounds like Judas had some poles
[1:09:56] he had a little bit of influence with
[1:09:58] the rest of the disciples
[1:10:01] hey why is she wasting this on on on on
[1:10:04] this uh anointing of Jesus
[1:10:09] and him and the disciples it says that
[1:10:11] they got indignant
[1:10:16] so indignation in the dictionary
[1:10:20] is anger or annoyance
[1:10:25] provoked by what is perceived as unfair
[1:10:28] treatment
[1:10:32] and in the Greek it says
[1:10:35] to be greatly Afflicted
[1:10:40] so they were annoyed they were Afflicted
[1:10:45] Judas felt that this wasn't the right
[1:10:47] way to spend this expensive Alabaster
[1:10:50] Box in oil
[1:10:55] but there was a pull inside of that
[1:10:58] woman
[1:11:01] there was a d like my brother said there
[1:11:03] was a deep calling to a deep in that
[1:11:05] woman
[1:11:07] she didn't even know what she was doing
[1:11:09] but she was doing it
[1:11:13] she was going to to anoint Jesus Christ
[1:11:17] perform a service unto Jesus Christ
[1:11:21] and here Judas is saying you don't need
[1:11:24] to do that you're wasting your time
[1:11:30] you're going too far you're being too
[1:11:33] religious
[1:11:34] you're being too extreme
[1:11:37] Mary was willing to take that oil
[1:11:42] that expensive oil
[1:11:45] that prized possession that she has
[1:11:49] and break it and offer the entire thing
[1:11:52] to Jesus
[1:11:54] use it completely without sparing a
[1:11:57] single drop on Jesus
[1:12:01] she didn't care about the money for
[1:12:04] tomorrow
[1:12:06] I don't care what people thought of her
[1:12:10] she didn't care that Judas and them were
[1:12:12] criticizing her murmuring about her
[1:12:15] YouTube
[1:12:24] is
[1:12:26] you don't have to give it all up for
[1:12:29] Jesus
[1:12:32] you don't have to give a Full Sacrifice
[1:12:34] Lord Jesus
[1:12:37] you don't have to give up everything
[1:12:40] don't give up everything
[1:12:43] you don't have to surrender your entire
[1:12:45] life
[1:12:47] you know Judas was only expressing the
[1:12:50] feelings
[1:12:56] of what it was lying inside of his heart
[1:13:01] in his mind in his soul just expressing
[1:13:05] it verbally
[1:13:07] with that indignation that was flowing
[1:13:10] through his veins
[1:13:13] because Judas wasn't willing to go all
[1:13:16] the way
[1:13:19] Judas wasn't willing to give it all up
[1:13:21] for Jesus
[1:13:24] that when he saw that there was someone
[1:13:26] that was
[1:13:30] it would go all the way is
[1:13:33] he had to call it a waste
[1:13:36] you're wasting your time
[1:13:39] why'd you take that less pain job to be
[1:13:42] here on Sat on Wednesday and Friday
[1:13:44] okay
[1:13:50] sisters why did you stop your career
[1:13:53] Hermanos
[1:13:55] to be a stay at home mom
[1:13:58] you're just wasting your time
[1:14:01] [Music]
[1:14:05] you're wasting your time
[1:14:12] that was calling a pure genuine believer
[1:14:16] and the worship that they were doing
[1:14:23] calling it just
[1:14:31] and there were some that had indignation
[1:14:33] within themselves and said why was this
[1:14:36] waste of the anointment on ointment made
[1:14:44] for it might have been sold for more
[1:14:46] than 300 Pence and have been given to
[1:14:48] the poor and they murmured against
[1:14:52] Heroes
[1:14:56] I like looking in different versions of
[1:14:59] the Bible
[1:15:01] and there's a version of in fact two or
[1:15:04] three versions
[1:15:06] that when they specify the cost of this
[1:15:09] oil this Alabaster Box in oil
[1:15:17] could be sold for a Year's wages
[1:15:24] Daniel I think minimum wage is around 30
[1:15:28] 40 000 a year okay
[1:15:32] if you're doing pretty good maybe you're
[1:15:34] making 60 70 000 a year
[1:15:38] maybe we have some brothers and sisters
[1:15:40] that make a hundred thousand dollars a
[1:15:42] year in here
[1:15:44] but here Jesus Judas is looking at the
[1:15:48] money aspect
[1:15:50] and say well you can sell this for sixty
[1:15:53] thousand eighty thousand a hundred
[1:15:54] thousand yeah
[1:15:57] and give to the poor and help the poor
[1:16:00] yeah
[1:16:03] wasting it on Jesus Christ
[1:16:09] if you get in the seat it seems like a
[1:16:11] noble thing to say
[1:16:15] something just and respectable to say
[1:16:20] it's a gift to the poor but uh
[1:16:24] but they murmured against us
[1:16:27] no it's like him saying yes you know you
[1:16:31] don't have to get rid of the Netflix
[1:16:34] why don't you better use it
[1:16:36] just watch the Disney movies and the kid
[1:16:39] movies
[1:16:42] you don't have to dress all fashioned
[1:16:46] you know you can just tone it down a bit
[1:16:49] you know just do it in church
[1:16:51] you don't have to stop cursing and doing
[1:16:54] these dirty jokes
[1:16:57] just just tone it down and try not to do
[1:17:00] it while you're on Church property
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:28] she was willing to go as far as she
[1:17:31] needed to with Jesus Christ
[1:17:34] let the spirit move her and take her
[1:17:38] where no amount of lost money could stop
[1:17:42] hero didn't matter the criticizers or
[1:17:45] the murmurs
[1:17:47] the first thing was going to stop her
[1:17:50] not a co-worker not a brother or sister
[1:17:53] in church
[1:17:55] the spirit was leading her
[1:17:58] and if the spirit is leading you is
[1:18:01] for you to go all the way foreign
[1:18:47] and kind of like how we we anoint uh for
[1:18:51] prayer with the oil
[1:18:54] and she just grabs a dab and puts a
[1:18:57] little bit on Jesus
[1:19:00] no she broke that box
[1:19:03] foreign
[1:20:49] she didn't take the TV and put it
[1:20:51] outside
[1:20:53] so that you know later on if she wants
[1:20:55] so she can plug it back up
[1:20:59] took that alcohol and put it in the
[1:21:01] freezer in the garage
[1:21:04] so that she could look at it in the
[1:21:06] fridge
[1:21:08] she can go grab it and drink it foreign
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:22:14] she wasn't going to turn back
[1:22:18] if we go back to the Book of John
[1:22:19] chapter 12.
[1:22:22] forgive me for getting emotional again
[1:22:26] John 12 4
[1:22:29] it says Lisa then saith one of his
[1:22:33] disciples Judas Iscariot Simon's son
[1:22:36] which should betray him
[1:22:42] why was not this ointment sold for 300
[1:22:45] Pence and given to the poorest
[1:22:49] this he said not that he cared for the
[1:22:52] poor pay attention not that he cared for
[1:22:55] the poor but because he was a thief and
[1:22:58] he had the bag and bear what was put
[1:23:01] there in
[1:23:06] okay
[1:23:13] he was a thief
[1:23:18] remember
[1:23:20] Judas was chosen by Jesus
[1:23:31] even still Jesus said
[1:23:34] one of you
[1:23:36] is a devil is Diablo Jesus still chose
[1:23:40] him
[1:23:41] knowing that he would betray him
[1:23:44] but Jesus walked with him
[1:23:48] walked with him laughed with him he ate
[1:23:50] with him
[1:23:52] kissed him he hugged him they slept side
[1:23:55] by side
[1:23:59] Jesus loved him
[1:24:02] loved him with an Agape
[1:24:05] not a filial love
[1:24:08] beyond that a Godly love
[1:24:12] knowing who he was
[1:24:14] knowing what he would do
[1:24:17] that's okay okay I'm gonna trust you
[1:24:20] with my money
[1:24:21] I want you right by my side
[1:24:24] I love you I believe it's brother Billy
[1:24:29] Pauly Paul that shares the testimony
[1:24:32] and our brother Jesus outside he shared
[1:24:35] it with me the other day
[1:24:38] that he didn't know the difference
[1:24:41] between his daddy's friends and his
[1:24:42] daddy's enemies
[1:24:47] we know brother Branham had people that
[1:24:50] hated him
[1:24:54] and we surely know that there were
[1:24:56] people that loved him is
[1:25:10] laugh with them just the same
[1:25:13] crack jokes with them just the same yeah
[1:25:24] just like Jesus would do to Judas
[1:25:28] not making a distinction
[1:25:31] attention but giving that true agape
[1:25:34] love
[1:25:36] Jesus didn't hold a grudge against Judas
[1:25:40] if you notice Jesus didn't even drop
[1:25:42] little hints that Judas was the evil one
[1:25:48] he was just the same as the rest of the
[1:25:51] 11 disciples
[1:25:54] now we all know that the spirits don't
[1:25:56] die
[1:25:58] the individual might die
[1:26:00] the spirit will circulate
[1:26:03] lives one and enters another is left I
[1:26:07] want to jump into another
[1:26:10] like when we were about 15 20 years ago
[1:26:13] that a rampage of mass murders at school
[1:26:20] and you'd hear like one every three
[1:26:22] weeks this high school and in that state
[1:26:24] and in that state The Same Spirit
[1:26:25] murdering those kids in school is
[1:26:33] after it blow their brains out the
[1:26:36] spirit said up off to get another one
[1:26:42] to find a new host somewhere to dwell
[1:26:44] foreign
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:27:02] [Music]
[1:28:01] that was saving a harlot Gomer today
[1:28:17] he rescued her time and time again
[1:28:25] and the Holy Spirit is
[1:28:28] still here today
[1:28:31] okay do we believe that it's still here
[1:28:33] today
[1:28:36] then the betraying Spirit of Judas is
[1:28:40] that one is also here today
[1:28:43] it is still here today
[1:28:46] and if it was right at the hip of Jesus
[1:28:49] back then
[1:28:52] it's right at the hip of Jesus today
[1:28:57] that's why we say wherever God is there
[1:28:59] is
[1:29:02] first one in the church is Satan himself
[1:29:06] see who he can deceive and who he can
[1:29:09] get inside
[1:29:12] because he's on the job 24 7.
[1:29:16] that Judas spirit is still working today
[1:29:23] this he said not that he cared for the
[1:29:26] poor but because he was a thief and had
[1:29:28] and had the bag and bear what was put
[1:29:30] therein but
[1:29:36] so
[1:29:39] Judas was stealing money here
[1:29:46] but that he was a thief
[1:29:49] his confirmed the thing
[1:29:53] that was the nature of the thief
[1:29:56] stealing from Jesus's Ministry of Jesus
[1:30:01] but let's not forget
[1:30:02] and I know I keep saying
[1:30:05] he was a hand-picked disciple of Jesus
[1:30:07] Christ
[1:30:13] out demons
[1:30:16] was given in office
[1:30:19] knowing who he was on the inside
[1:30:28] I want you in my presence
[1:30:32] I want you to be surrounded by my
[1:30:34] anointing
[1:30:36] I want you to always feel the presence
[1:30:39] of God
[1:30:41] because you won't have an excuse on that
[1:30:44] day
[1:30:47] I didn't even know that there was a holy
[1:30:49] ghost
[1:30:51] I didn't even know that there was a new
[1:30:53] birth
[1:30:55] I didn't know there was an end time
[1:30:57] message
[1:31:00] I didn't know about allowed to say in
[1:31:02] the Rapture
[1:31:05] no I've got you right here yes you do
[1:31:08] know
[1:31:10] and have you ever noticed when people go
[1:31:12] to church
[1:31:14] you know I see it all the time
[1:31:17] they go to feel good
[1:31:20] you know not always that someone dragged
[1:31:23] you
[1:31:24] it's not always the you've got these big
[1:31:27] problems
[1:31:29] but sometimes people just want to get
[1:31:31] that feel good feeling that Band-Aid on
[1:31:33] their conscience
[1:31:37] they get a little comfortable
[1:31:40] to feel a little bit of that security
[1:31:42] that good news gospel that was preached
[1:31:44] to them foreign
[1:32:25] when just last night about six hours ago
[1:32:28] they were posting in the club dancing
[1:32:29] naked
[1:32:34] I still even hear it in the barbershop
[1:32:36] today
[1:32:37] oh man I just went to church yesterday
[1:32:40] you know I'm feeling good I'm ready for
[1:32:42] the week
[1:32:45] not knowing what they're going for since
[1:32:48] not knowing what it is that they're
[1:32:50] hearing since not knowing whose presence
[1:32:53] they're in since
[1:32:55] not having a revelation
[1:32:59] it makes me think of something my father
[1:33:01] told me when I was little is
[1:33:05] about our precious brother burning
[1:33:09] and how it is that he would he would
[1:33:11] come out of service
[1:33:13] and you know people would be smiling and
[1:33:16] laughing and looking at him
[1:33:20] and they would you know congratulate him
[1:33:23] oh brother tremendous message
[1:33:35] you know I'm so sick of that
[1:33:38] the people didn't even understand what
[1:33:41] was just preached
[1:33:45] they don't even know what was just said
[1:33:51] if they would have had the revelation of
[1:33:53] what was said
[1:33:56] I would have understood what was being
[1:33:58] preached
[1:34:00] they would have been hiding their faces
[1:34:02] in shame
[1:34:05] they would be scared for their lives
[1:34:09] they would be surrendering themselves to
[1:34:12] Jesus Christ
[1:34:14] but in other words it just came out all
[1:34:17] nice and happy
[1:34:19] with a nice kind
[1:34:31] in other words seated in the presence of
[1:34:33] God
[1:34:39] I'm having zero conviction on the inside
[1:34:45] feeling like everything's okay
[1:34:49] well it's not okay feeling like you're
[1:34:52] clean on the inside
[1:34:54] when you're not clean on the inside
[1:34:58] just like Judas who spent all his time
[1:35:02] with Jesus
[1:35:04] you've been called out already
[1:35:07] Judas was called out at one point
[1:35:11] it's been placed in the ministry
[1:35:14] and Judas was placed in the ministry
[1:35:17] you you walk with God
[1:35:21] like the theme of our campaign
[1:35:28] Judas walked with God he walked with him
[1:35:32] but Judas was still stealing
[1:35:36] doing things in private
[1:35:39] taking that money in private is someone
[1:35:44] it's here today
[1:35:46] you know in the privacy of your own home
[1:35:49] in your own lives is probably still
[1:35:52] dressing unladylike
[1:35:56] probably still got that foul mouth
[1:35:59] it's probably still watching pornography
[1:36:03] in the privacy of your own home in life
[1:36:08] somebody is probably still wearing
[1:36:10] makeup still drinking still using drugs
[1:36:15] in the privacy of your own life
[1:36:18] someone is probably Alvin kisas
[1:36:22] still lying to themselves on the inside
[1:36:28] it's all right
[1:36:30] it's okay estabien because I'm going to
[1:36:33] church
[1:36:34] because I go to Jericho Tabernacles
[1:36:37] because I don't miss a single service
[1:36:39] during the week
[1:36:42] I know I'm doing those bad things
[1:36:45] but I'm still right next to Jesus so
[1:36:48] it's okay
[1:36:51] Judas was doing those things
[1:36:54] while standing right next to Jesus
[1:36:58] Judas had a Ministry and still stealing
[1:37:00] right next to Jesus
[1:37:04] but God had a purpose
[1:37:08] Judas was serving out that purpose
[1:37:12] and Judas today is also serving his
[1:37:15] purpose
[1:37:17] that Thief that betrayer that liar is
[1:37:22] still has to be next to Jesus today to
[1:37:25] fulfill a purpose
[1:37:28] and he has power
[1:37:31] he does the signs and wonders
[1:37:34] preaches in Jesus name
[1:37:37] things in Jesus name without demons in
[1:37:40] Jesus name
[1:37:42] but what does the Bible say
[1:37:45] sorry
[1:37:47] get away from me you never knew me I
[1:37:52] never knew you
[1:37:53] you might have been using my name
[1:37:56] they might have been going to church he
[1:37:58] says you might have slept right next to
[1:38:00] me and kiss me in the morning
[1:38:04] but that's not the type of love that I
[1:38:06] wanted
[1:38:12] I
[1:38:15] needed an obedience to the word a
[1:38:17] hundred percent
[1:38:40] and it was the spirit that betrayed
[1:38:43] Jesus the spirit in him that betrayed
[1:38:45] Jesus
[1:38:47] and it'll be the same spirit that
[1:38:49] betrays him today
[1:38:51] but the Bible repeats and repeats itself
[1:38:55] who was it that gave Joseph the hard
[1:38:58] problems
[1:39:00] those trials his brothers his own
[1:39:05] brothers
[1:39:06] who wasn't then Moses had these trials
[1:39:08] with it
[1:39:10] with his own people of Israel
[1:39:13] that he had to deal with
[1:39:16] and sometimes where do we face the
[1:39:18] biggest trials
[1:39:22] from our own brothers and sisters in
[1:39:24] church
[1:39:27] the
[1:39:29] murmursiones the criticizers
[1:39:32] the finger pointers
[1:39:34] why does it have to be our own family
[1:39:39] because the word says the we in the
[1:39:41] tears they grow together
[1:39:46] but one's going to grow tall and strong
[1:39:50] and it's going to wither off and die
[1:39:53] because there's no life in it but the
[1:39:57] other one grows and the seed of life is
[1:40:00] flowing through it
[1:40:03] and life continues
[1:40:07] because it's a genuine seed of God
[1:40:14] says this he said not that he cared for
[1:40:17] the poor but because he was a thief and
[1:40:20] he had the bag and bear what was put
[1:40:22] therein is
[1:40:29] you know no one suspected a single thing
[1:40:34] we suspect things
[1:40:37] we know the story foreign
[1:41:03] not to put our Treasurer on the spot
[1:41:07] how can we blame the treasurer
[1:41:10] we trust him with the entire Church's
[1:41:13] income and financial decisions
[1:41:18] how can he be the one to deceive the
[1:41:20] church
[1:41:23] probably it was Peter
[1:41:27] you know that loud enough Peter
[1:41:32] short-tempered feisty guy is
[1:41:35] just always so aggressive and ready to
[1:41:38] jump
[1:41:41] he didn't have a good resume
[1:41:43] you know if anything that would be the
[1:41:46] guy to choose
[1:41:51] but then Jesus tells everyone
[1:41:54] I'm going to be captured one day
[1:41:57] I'm gonna have to go through the
[1:41:58] suffering I'm gonna be crucified
[1:42:02] Peter did something that didn't help his
[1:42:04] case
[1:42:06] they're already looking at him like I
[1:42:08] don't know I think it's him
[1:42:11] he said no no Jesus I won't let that
[1:42:14] happen
[1:42:16] no they're not going to take you I'm
[1:42:19] going to stand next to you
[1:42:22] no no I'll take him I got to kill them
[1:42:24] all kill them all
[1:42:27] and then what did Jesus
[1:42:30] an answer and told him
[1:42:38] straight up calls Peter
[1:42:42] satanas you know anyone that was present
[1:42:45] there
[1:42:47] I'm just trying to paint a picture for
[1:42:50] everybody
[1:42:52] I hope you're sitting in that room that
[1:42:55] room like I'm sitting in that room right
[1:42:56] now
[1:43:00] they're probably saying well good thing
[1:43:02] I'm not best friends with Peter because
[1:43:05] because I always knew there was
[1:43:08] something rough about that guy
[1:43:11] I know he just got the keys to the
[1:43:13] kingdom and that was a good Revelation
[1:43:18] but Jesus just said you're you're Satan
[1:43:23] Diablo I'm gonna go take my food and I'm
[1:43:26] gonna go hang out with Judas
[1:43:30] the rest of my night with Judas
[1:43:34] because he's the good guy he's the
[1:43:37] treasurer
[1:43:38] he's the one that that Jesus Christ
[1:43:40] loves and trusts
[1:43:43] but our carnal Minds cannot comprehend
[1:43:46] the things of God foreign
[1:44:21] to anoint my body to the bearing this is
[1:44:31] willing to do it all
[1:44:33] but Judas wouldn't do a thing
[1:44:36] this woman would give it all
[1:44:57] [Music]
[1:45:09] what did Judas feel like the first time
[1:45:12] that he stole
[1:45:15] how did you feel the first time you did
[1:45:17] something wrong in church
[1:45:21] if someone is still doing it in church
[1:45:26] maybe you can go back to the first time
[1:45:29] you did it
[1:45:31] and maybe Judas was nervous when he took
[1:45:34] five dollars out
[1:45:38] and then Jesus comes by and says here's
[1:45:41] another 500.
[1:45:45] does it doesn't uh rebuke him at all
[1:45:50] and you know Judas is probably thinking
[1:45:52] well you know I'm the one that collects
[1:45:53] the money is
[1:45:59] also got to preach the gospel
[1:46:02] watch over the church
[1:46:04] no I think I deserve my cut okay
[1:46:09] he took that
[1:46:12] my brother Peter knows this one right
[1:46:17] you put it right in that pocket he took
[1:46:20] that money right they put it right in
[1:46:21] that pocket
[1:46:24] because he felt he deserved something
[1:46:27] he needed a little bit more uh I'm
[1:46:31] running the music department
[1:46:34] I'm dealing with the deacons I'm doing
[1:46:37] this I'm doing that I got all the youth
[1:46:39] on my back
[1:46:42] I think I need a little cut okay
[1:46:46] it's humor
[1:46:50] there was a first time for everything
[1:46:54] and it was the first time that Judas
[1:46:58] but once he did it and was it rebuked
[1:47:02] you know foreign
[1:47:42] and
[1:47:46] the grace of God
[1:47:48] and nothing happened so he felt okay
[1:47:52] so that's Sinful Nature has started
[1:47:55] growing and growing and growing
[1:47:59] and those excuses as to why he does the
[1:48:02] sin that he does kept growing and
[1:48:04] growing
[1:48:08] well I I still wear pants
[1:48:12] but I've got an accident yet
[1:48:15] I still cheat my employees or my
[1:48:19] businesses I'm a thief
[1:48:21] is
[1:48:26] struck me dead yet
[1:48:28] and I go to church and I sing every
[1:48:32] Sunday and I pray every Sunday
[1:48:35] God's with me God loves me because
[1:48:38] that's what Judas thoughts
[1:48:41] Judah said
[1:48:43] how Jesus called out Pharisees
[1:48:48] how he would expose the sin and discern
[1:48:50] the hearts
[1:48:54] so he knew Jesus could do that to him
[1:48:59] because of the love he had he he got in
[1:49:02] the comfort zone
[1:49:05] the love that Jesus was giving him
[1:49:09] the comfort zone of death foreign
[1:49:18] and growing in him
[1:49:22] sin after sin after sin because
[1:49:28] Time After Time Again
[1:49:33] the people were healed
[1:49:35] people these Miracles that happen in
[1:49:38] them
[1:49:40] we've all seen those Miracles happening
[1:49:44] I'm proud to be now having a baby which
[1:49:47] is a miracle for me
[1:49:55] he knew how to go to Jesus
[1:50:03] might be hiding
[1:50:07] but you also know who you can go too
[1:50:10] you also know how you can go to here
[1:50:13] and you've seen it more than enough time
[1:51:17] so set me free against
[1:52:18] I said no no no no no not that
[1:52:21] but this woman
[1:52:23] we can say this ignorant simple-minded
[1:52:26] woman
[1:52:30] you didn't ask questions she didn't use
[1:52:34] her mind to think about it
[1:52:36] she went and she performed that service
[1:52:40] she broke
[1:52:42] she put it all on the line right there
[1:52:45] because it's always a woman
[1:52:48] it's a bride that's going to do it it's
[1:52:51] a bride that's going to be anointed
[1:52:54] it's a bride that's going to wash his
[1:52:57] feet
[1:53:02] it just wants more and more of that love
[1:53:04] from him
[1:53:07] this simple woman
[1:53:09] that's so much Revelation because she
[1:53:12] didn't even know it
[1:53:14] she couldn't even explain it she didn't
[1:53:17] even know why where
[1:53:42] she that she hath done this shall be
[1:53:45] spoken of her as a memorial for her
[1:53:50] they would always remember what she did
[1:53:54] because she surrendered
[1:53:57] she was the washing of that lamb she was
[1:54:00] the anointing
[1:54:02] and there was a showdown right there
[1:54:06] between the make-believer and a genuine
[1:54:09] believer
[1:54:10] the one that wanted to take the money
[1:54:13] for something else
[1:54:15] and the one they wanted to give it all
[1:54:17] for Jesus
[1:54:47] and it wasn't a large rebuking
[1:54:51] but simply telling her why don't why
[1:54:53] don't you give to the poor
[1:54:55] he lifted her up and put him down
[1:55:00] he said she's going to have a memorial
[1:55:03] well you go out and give to the poor
[1:55:06] from
[1:55:07] his pride was struck at that moment
[1:55:11] and it's something so dangerous that
[1:55:14] Pride yes
[1:55:16] because in the very next verse
[1:55:19] is when he got struck his his project
[1:55:21] got hit so hard
[1:55:25] he turned around and betrayed Jesus
[1:55:28] Jesus you know if I had to pick
[1:55:32] between the the rebuking and Peter God
[1:55:38] and then the rebuking that the Judas God
[1:55:41] is
[1:55:42] I would probably take judas's rebuke him
[1:55:48] Jesus embarrassed Peter
[1:55:50] Jesus and he called him uh Satan in
[1:55:54] front of everyone
[1:55:57] but the difference between the two
[1:55:59] people
[1:56:00] is that Peter wasn't going to turn
[1:56:02] around and betray Jesus
[1:56:11] we knew that sometimes love comes with a
[1:56:14] little spanking versus
[1:56:18] so like the Alexi the elect price
[1:56:24] brother Eli they get up here give us a
[1:56:26] little whooping this is
[1:56:45] [Music]
[1:56:47] that was too much for him
[1:56:49] oh that's it this is the last straw now
[1:56:55] I'm done I'm gonna I'm gonna betray
[1:56:58] Jesus
[1:56:59] Jesus says in Judas is one of the twelve
[1:57:02] went unto the chief priest to betray him
[1:57:09] the make-believer could not handle pure
[1:57:12] worship
[1:57:17] that's too much for him
[1:57:19] he couldn't take it
[1:57:22] like brother Brandon said he didn't have
[1:57:24] that real face
[1:57:26] the faith to know that was the son of
[1:57:28] God
[1:57:29] foreign
[1:57:41] [Music]
[1:57:51] says when Jesus said that he was
[1:57:53] troubled in the spirit and testified and
[1:57:55] said verily verily I say unto you that
[1:57:57] one of you should betray me Jesus
[1:58:04] and the disciples look to one another
[1:58:06] who who does who does he speak of is
[1:58:12] and now there was leaning on Jesus one
[1:58:14] of his disciples whom he loved
[1:58:20] Jesus and Simon asked to ask of him who
[1:58:24] is Jesus talking about yes
[1:58:29] and he said Lord who is it
[1:58:32] and Jesus answer
[1:58:34] Jesus so whom I shall give us up when
[1:58:37] it's dipped when I dipped it and when he
[1:58:40] had dipped us up he gave it to iscaria
[1:58:42] the son of Simon Jesus
[1:58:58] and after this and after the sap Satan
[1:59:01] entered into him it is
[1:59:05] Jesus said unto him thou doest what thou
[1:59:08] doest do it quickly
[1:59:12] and then verse 28 says
[1:59:15] but no man at the table knew for what
[1:59:18] intent he was speaking of
[1:59:24] even then they still didn't know who it
[1:59:27] was
[1:59:33] you named him by
[1:59:36] satanas and they were still looking who
[1:59:39] could this be
[1:59:41] for some of them
[1:59:44] because Judas had the bag
[1:59:47] that Jesus had gave unto him
[1:59:50] by those things we need for the feast
[1:59:53] he should give them to the poor okay
[1:59:56] they were still thinking that Judas was
[1:59:59] the the righteous one
[2:00:03] but both Vines grow together
[2:00:08] they grow together they come up together
[2:00:11] in the church
[2:00:13] they thought it might have been Peter
[2:00:16] might have thought it might have been
[2:00:18] this one or that one of the disciples
[2:00:22] all along they were looking with the
[2:00:24] natural eyes
[2:00:27] when they had that deceiver right in
[2:00:30] front of him
[2:00:32] we're going to be closing
[2:00:35] in the message
[2:00:42] in 1965 January 20.
[2:00:47] says now wait he can take care of
[2:00:50] himself
[2:00:53] I've seen him in great battles
[2:00:55] and here Jesus was talking about Judas
[2:00:58] Jesus
[2:01:00] I know that he can take care of himself
[2:01:03] so I know that I could make some money
[2:01:07] maybe get like a little retirement
[2:01:12] so he did to Jesus what the scripture
[2:01:15] said he would do
[2:01:19] now for the sake of time going through
[2:01:21] Matthew
[2:01:24] as it starts to explain when when they
[2:01:27] took Jesus
[2:01:32] you know Judas never expected to happen
[2:01:35] what it was that happened
[2:01:38] you know brother Brandon said that he's
[2:01:40] won many battles
[2:01:43] some of which like when Jesus was going
[2:01:45] to be stoned uh
[2:02:46] he wouldn't have another opportunity
[2:02:50] I ask for forgiveness to fix what he had
[2:02:54] done
[2:02:55] that it was too late
[2:02:57] but you know at the same time
[2:03:01] when Jesus was being crucified
[2:03:11] if the musicians want to come forward
[2:03:15] at the very same time
[2:03:18] when Jesus is being crucified
[2:03:21] there was another death taking place
[2:03:27] when Peter had fallen
[2:03:29] no that was like a mistake
[2:03:32] you know he it's like he backslid for a
[2:03:36] momento he landed in a trap and just
[2:03:39] made an honest mistake foreign
[2:04:08] at the expense of the life of Jesus
[2:04:11] Christ
[2:04:13] because he thought Jesus would Escape
[2:04:17] but he didn't have the Revelation
[2:04:20] Jesus Christ had to die
[2:04:23] he had to be on that cross
[2:04:26] because he had a group of people that he
[2:04:28] needed to die for the personas he was
[2:04:32] going to save one day
[2:04:35] he was going to fill with the Holy Ghost
[2:04:37] one day
[2:04:40] he was going to Rapture one day
[2:04:43] and when Judah saw that
[2:04:46] there was he himself hung himself
[2:04:50] because he couldn't take it it was too
[2:04:54] much for him
[2:04:55] that sin it overflowed inside of him
[2:04:58] there was no turning back at that moment
[2:05:51] all your honor and Glory
[2:05:55] know that you love me
[2:05:58] get out of that comfort zone you might
[2:06:01] be him foreign
[2:06:45] [Music]
[2:07:07] we're gonna continue walking
[2:07:10] because Lord we know
[2:07:13] that day is
[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:27] forgive our sins senor
[2:07:31] forgive our flowers
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:42] we don't come to church to cover up the
[2:07:44] sins
[2:07:46] but we come to church to fix this is
[2:07:52] take that oil this morning
[2:07:55] and accept the sacrifice this morning
