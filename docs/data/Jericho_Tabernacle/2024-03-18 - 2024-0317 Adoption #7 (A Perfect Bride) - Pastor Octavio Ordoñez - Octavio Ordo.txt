[Applause] God bless you this [Music] morning the Lord bless you for the ones who are joining us this morning they were they asked me to give a [Music] report to the from the trip from El Salvador um um recently in these past weeks I was uh traveling quite a bit before going to Al Salvador I was in tuon and before tuon I was in Mex I would say something strange happened to me in Mexicali and God showed me later on there in Salvador the last occasion that I was in Mexicali it was about two years ago I went with brother into a minister meeting the reason why we went is because was going to speak in those meetings and every Minister that was going to speak had an appointed topic of what they were going to talk about and brother mata's topic was like the flying saucers the UFOs and we find that those are fine in the Bible and after the minister meeting was done we were going to go to the the mission there in St Louis and that trip was cancelled so we stayed in Mex Min amicos in the same time there was an American brothers that visited us uh and they needed an [Music] interpreter since we didn't go to St Louis and we stayed I I stayed to interpret the brothers and for one reason I couldn't understand uh there on Sunday had to stay with the pastor and other ministers to interpret them and the pastor shared with me a dream of his mother and this is before this is before they came in the message and he he said that in his mother's dream she saw a flying saucer and that Flying Saucer was coming and then it stayed still a window was open and someone came out of that Flying Saucer and that person was brother Bram and a voice came out and said this is the most sincere person who I can can trust with my word for for one reason or another I couldn't understand why on Sunday that the brother was sharing this dream of the Flying Saucer and the day before brother Mata was speaking of the topic of the flying saucers I didn't make the connection until this last occasion that I went to Mexicali I remember what the pastor shared with me then me I started to study the flying saucers according to the message and the day I spoke was the 25th of February and this scripture came to my mind in the book of aladiah the vision of abah thus sayth the Lord God concerning Edom we have heard a rumor from the Lord and an ambassador is sent among the Heathen arise he and let us rise up against her in battle behold I have made thee a small among among Thee the Heathen Thou Art greatly despised the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee thou that dwellest in the Cass of the Rocks whose habitation is high that that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground if you notice that's speaking about the devil that arrogant spirit that wants to come up higher where God is found that is the spirit of the devil verse four says Thou though thou exalt thyself as the eag and though thou set thy Nest Among the Stars Then will I bring thee down sayith the Lord there's a message that brother Ram preaches as called a countdown and he speaks about the astronauts in that message and brother R says what God allows them to do in science because God is showing what God's going to do in the church so when we went to Salvador houon it seems that we made a layover or a flight layover there in Houston Houston is is and Houston is the city of the astronauts I didn't find out until we're coming back and when we got to Salvador the pastor brother picked us up he took us to a high mountain that is called the devil's gate I find it very humorous that we were in the place of the El Salvador the savior and there is a place called The Devil's gate but I found out that that place is in the Bible it's here in abah that we just read because there there's a legend about that place that Legend is about the Civil War that they were having there in the in the country of El Salvador and the legend itself it says the devil was trying to seduce a young lady and he finally seduced her and took her to that mountain or that high place and she uh made the the bride for him and when her family found out that she was up there not wanted to leave her in the claws of the devil they went to go and rescue her and they said the legend says they had the devil surrounded and he went through the Rock and he split open The Rock you abah 13 it says the pride of thine heart had deceived thee thou that dwellest in the class of the rock whose habitation is high that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground then I remember why I went to Mexicali I begin to study the flying saucers how that the devil is trying to copy the astronaut then they take us to the devil's gate then I keep reading in aladiah and then I go to verse 21 we're in the country of salad in verse 21 it says and it says and saviors shall come up on on the Mount Zion to judge the Mount of Esa and the kingdom shall be the Lords how can I see that the Brethren of the the salvadorians are in the Bible it says and saviors not savior but saviors we we had a really good time there with brother Ardo we had really good fellowship with brother Jose and his family they treated us very well the food was very good the bestas I ever had in my life and I can see why the the God was guiding me in that way sometimes God has to put you will guide you to different places and then he shows you why he took you to that place there were other things that are in my heart I can find answers for that there in salvad there's a reason for everything so receive greetings from the brothers from the G family from Brother and his wife they send forth their greetings may the Lord bless [Applause] you good morning we want to welcome each and every one of you we first of all want to give the most cordial welcome to the Holy Spirit to this place he is our uh guest of honor asking that he may be able to move freely amongst us and touch the hearts of each and every one of us we want to welcome

really nice when people want to fellowship with you being message Believers we can fellowship with any other message believer we're not tied down by denominational systems if people want to fellowship with us that's fine we want to fellowship with you also so that's a that's a great privilege uh brother Juanito is out of town today uh brother uh Eli is speaking in Chandler Chandler and uh it is a great blessing to have a ministry that's capable to go out and preach I'd like to go over the stature of a perfect man we we touched this subject last week this is uh this stature of a perfect man if you can put it up there it is is really loaded with information it it has has uh the church ages it has the virtues and it has The Messengers and not only that but we can add to that other teachings that brother Braham brought we can add to that the lion age see the first church age was was Brother Paul's or or the Apostle Paul's Church age it was the church age of the word the lion age the second age the church started dying off in the third age ages it died in the fourth age it was actually buried that whole age is called the ox age the sacrificial animal age age that the that the people died for their testimony for what they believe they were killed as we know in the 300 year or so uh the Catholic Church started up but then in the fifth Church age we have what we call the the Reformation age it changed to a man age so that man age is a Martin Luther it's called the the the man age the Reformation age just shall live by faith and then the next age the sixth agage we have sanctification with John Wesley ju Wesley it it started improving and then now we have what we call is a Pentecostal and this Pentecostal age is it's much different of the other ages because it changed changed over to an eagle age and the eagle age can see a little further see a little different than the other ages once again the first church age it's also called the seed age the seed age is a very important part or very important age that's the age that we study the first church age the first church age has to do with the Apostle Paul and that's the only really the only age that we really study the only age that is referred back to that first church age is what wrote the fir the New Testament that's the only one we compare to is that first church age it was the word age and as we studied last week that word started dying out right away the second age in the third age once again it died but in the fourth age it was buried but we have something different on the fifth Church age fif church is the word started coming back brother Braham talks about this quite a bit in 1965 and he said it very uh quite a few times and that is called the the age or the time that we had the stock age yes of the wheat and Wesley says the tassel started growing and now in this age we had John Wesley Wesley and then on the seventh age says on the seventh age you have to be very careful because this age is very deceiving it's the most deceiving age is the age that we live in the seventh Church age because we have what was called the Chuck age the Chuck the very deceiving age the Chuck must be sure to wait in the sun to be ripen to be sure the seed is back to its original form from the beginning Pentecostal age this seed has to ripen and it has to ripen under under the word under this church under this message it has to ripen it's not the Chuck but it's the seed that's in there once again Martin Luther has a stock John Wesley has a tassel ju W and in this Pentecostal age we have the child but within that sh we have this message it's the message of the hour it's the seed hour the time this seed goes back to its original we have something we called the message of the hour someone asked me okay you say you have the message of the hour what's that message have you ever thought of that someone asked me the other day well you have the message what is that message it's a message of restoration that brings us back to the original the Pentecostal age but that's not all it takes us even farther than that into a resurrection and into a Rapture it's a message of restoration bringing us back to the word we don't compare to any other Church age except that first one the one we're supposed to go back to the message the one we study we study that first church age everything else will be burned everything else will be burned except this message of the hour the the Bride of this church age of this message will be the one that's being resurrected and raptured now each age had its time each Church age Messenger will present his group each Messenger will present his group in the message beyond the curtain of time brother Braham mentions that each message will present its group but we also have something that we call unleavened bread each Church age had its time of word but we canot use any other's bread or any others word because each Church age had his own we have seven unleavened bread Church ages I hope that makes sense the church is in pregnated with this word the church is takes in this church this church message does that make sense the bride is marrying at this time I hope that makes sense see we're going to the marriage Lamb's supper so we're getting married here and Christ is coming back for his bride to take her now the bride there's three phases to the bride if you remember the vision of the Bride the first bride age was clean was beautiful prophets are walking it was great it was it was perfect but then we had what he was called a vulgar bride and it was from the United States and throughout the world they tried to say it was a bright and he was sick to the stomach watching her but at the end the message Right comes to the scene so see we can also put that in that stature of a perfect man there are many things or many subjects that just adds up to that stature of a perfect man message this word so perfect that you can put it there and if you are able to put it there then you can find it in the message find it in the word of God the message today is called a Perfect Bride God's coming back for a Perfect Bride well how are you going to do that we're still living in this world how how can we do something like that oh one other thing we can also put the rainbow in there let's look at the the scriptures that are on there let's read a little bit uh second Peter 1 Chapter first verse Simon Peter a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that had obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and good godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things abide for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen let's go to Acts chapter 7 verse 4 7:44 our fathers had the Tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen which also our fathers that come that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles whom God dra out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David who found favor before God and Desir to find a tabernacle for the god of Jacob but Solomon built him in house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as says the prophet Heaven and Earth is my throne and Earth is my foot stol what house will you build me says the Lord or what is the place of my rest what is God's place of rest Hebrews 105 wherefore when he cometh into the world he says SA sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not but a body has has thou prepared me amen amen 1132 many Heroes of the faith and what shall I more say for the time will fail me to tell of Gideon and of Barak and of Samson and of jof of David also and S Samuel and of the prophets he who through faith subdued kingdoms righteousness obtain promises stopped the mouth of lions quench the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax violent and fight turned to fight the armies of the aliens woman raised their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trial of cruel mocking and of scorings yeah moreover the bonds and imprisonment they were ston they were s aunder were tempted were slain with a sword they wandered about in Chief skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and these all having the T a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect Matthew chapter 548 brother Bram says that God is waiting for us he is waiting for us Matthew 5:48 but be ye perfect even as Our Father which is in heaven is perfect remember we're talking about perfect be ye perfect we'll explain that in a little bit Ephesians 41 and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ for the perfecting of the Saints so we all come in the unity of faith and of the knowledge of of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ be ye perfect perfecting of the Saints and unto a perfect man that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking in the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ so we need to be perfect mentioned that several times in the Bible so how can we be perfect brother Braham uh teaches a series of messages we won't have time to read them but I'll mention them and then I'll read the last one but what's very interesting is how he brought it on the 1964 then 1965 and he finishes with the message Rapture and things that are to be in 1964 7:26 in the morning he preached recognizing your day and his message and he explains the evening time message how it was to restore back again to bring back the same thing again and he talks about the bride and he shows who the bride is throughout the ages then he says the the bride will come and to preview again the very same bride the very same looking bride that passed in the beginning bride in the beginning vulgar bride and another bride very very interesting how brother B brings that 1964 1212 brother Bram preaches the Harvest time and it has it has to do with the ministry just exactly on the word the ministry has to be exactly on the word it says here uh Ministry just exactly on the word like he was on the word the first church was on the word spirit filled word fed not denominational fed word fed in 64 1212 we preached the Harvest Time and he really goes into talking about the wheat how he had Lutheran age the Wesley Age and and he types the two with the wheat and he says on that Matthew 2424 it would deceive the very elect if it was possible is it possible to fool the elect it's not it can't fool the elect we have come out of those denominational systems to this word in 1965 the seed is not air with the Shu again he really hammers at the stock the tassel and the Chuck says like a seed is planted brings fors the stock the blade shoots from it and the tassel the P the pollen hangs on it and then the Chuck and then the seed age in 1965 410 the east Easter seal he say son of man come back as a prophetic message for the last day when that age will be flying not the lion not the ox in the sacrifice age see see every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world when the lion raised up the religious power it went to meet the Roman power and then when come the sacrifice our the ox went because he's the sacrifice or beast of the Lord then comes the reformers down through the church Ages come to the face of man and the reformers had been since Luther Wesley C and on down then Pentecostal age but in the message that went forth there come a flying eagle the eagle time revealed time the word of God made manifest the word of God provided the eagle age calls out the people from those denominations he tells them you're not chickens you're Eagles get out of there get out of those pens your Eagles you're flying higher than that out of those denominational systems why brother Brams hit so hard those denominal denominational systems that was his job to get those denominational those people off off those denominational systems and bring them to the word the message that's our place of Refuge this message of the hour nowhere else to go message of the hour it's for our time but the last message that went forth there come a flying ego it's ego time reveal time the word of God made manifest the word of God proved I like that the word of God proved oh children walk into this baptism of the Holy Spirit come in and believe it with all your heart God will fill you on the message 1965 0410 the Easter seal oh wait up I got this wrong at 65 11:28 in the morning God's only provided place of worship brother Brown says the only bread that you can eat is the word the denominational word for those ages will not help you today read this part here but the lives going right on through what happens all the life that was in the stock in the T and the chuck all winds up in the wheat and that same holy ghost that brought Luther brought Wesley brought Pentecostals winds up in the bride at the resurrection then he goes on to preach the Rapture 65 1204 but in the sight of God the bride is Justified she never done it in the first place amen standing there married to The Virtuous Son of God never sinned in the first place why she was foreordained she was trapped into this and now when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleanses her and she stands her virtuous see she's no sin in her at all therefore the message calls the bride together see the shout see the message of the hour perfects the bright cuz she was in sin she was in the denominational system but when she realizes that she was there and comes into this word she is perfected in this word and it was like she never s to begin withed in the message of the hour I hope we understand that but in the sight of God the bride is Justified she never did it in the first place she never did it in the first place amen amen standing there married to this virtuous Son of God never sinned in the first place why she was for ordained predestined to hear this message man we're such a blessed people see she was trapped into this and now when she heard the truth and come forth the blood cleansed her and she stands her virtuous see she no sin on her at all therefore the message calls a bride together see the shout the the message the the Rapture is a tremendous message he wasn't able to finish that message so the next day 1965 1205 he preached things that are to be this is a continuation of the previous message because he wasn't able to finish it and this I want to really make sure we get this it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to you have to be perfect to get there the Bible said so Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect Son of God and you must be a perfect bride so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins that's right the blood of Jesus Christ

[Music] li graas for [Music] for here I am EV Lord you [Music] [Applause] go me where [Music] [Music] and for me fore I me for for [Music] for don't amen amen [Music] amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the reason why we're here is because I asked the pastor yeah that we've been walking for roughly about three years now and tomorrow we're going to be fulfilling three years my wife and I of having the Monday morning prayer service I call her my uh not so that anybody would misunderstand me but we have 57 years of marriage and she has Stood Beside Me she has backed me up and she's cooperated in all of the activities that I attend and the day that she leaves I'm going to be left with limp in my walk and if I leave I'm coming for her and so since it's been three years I just want you to understand that it's good to remember certain things about how God has helped us since we started here in this place brother Johnny told me that he had a job to do and later on we came into an agreement that if I could uh have this prayer service between 10 to 11: a.m. every Monday from 10 to 11 just one hour to dedicated to meditation to pray in silence and God has done great things and in those times that we've had prayer there's many testimonies even amongst you that have given testimony about being healed because if there is an hour to be dedicated to prayer we must take advantage of it and then every time that we finish in that hour I as an elder and the person in charge of the prayer service alongside with my brother here that helps me brother this brother has been a great help to me he is [Music] aacon so then he has the authority to anoint the people with oil because after the prayer I pray for the brothers that come in sick or that are sick or that have a need because I see that people come here and I hear the people come and tell me brother T please pray for my husband who is in prison and you know when a mother or a wife is asking then you have to give kind of words of encouragement God has answered thanks be to or if somebody has a sick family member at home we pray for them as well and we can also go to your home if you invite me whatever time is lotted we can go and visit and pray for that person that's sick and by God's grace he has accompanied us and there have been many testimonies where brothers and sisters have healed from cancer of nervousness of fear of many different sicknesses and we have here many testimonies between or amongst us that have been delivered of a demon called cancer because that's one of the great demons that are empowering themselves here on Earth and the prophet said that the day would come that cancer would be like a toothache how many of you have ever had a toothache it's something tremendous right and in another occasion he said in World War II so that over 200 million demons were set free unto humanity and those are the ones that are are tormenting many of us but the prayer of the just the word of God the God says shall heal the sick and the Lord shall raise him up the Lord raises him up not me God gives him the healing not me the only thing that I tell him is that when I pray I pray believing I I don't go in the prayer saying oh hopefully he can I believe it with all my heart that the power of the spoken word is in us because since the beginning it was given in that manner man was made in the the likeness of God and he gave him the power of the spoken word and man named all the beasts on the in the land you shall be called elephant and giraffe you this and that and the names that you hear right now from the animals the man that was uh made out of clay he spoke his and gave the power of the spoken word and until today those names are still set in place and we are now living in the time of restoration where we will go back to the original restoration when the bride shall then dress herself and restore back to her original state because the scriptures say about a virgin that he shall have a uh virgin without any spot or wrinkle who the Lord Jesus Christ because back in the beginning the first Adam was unto death but the later Adam is unto eternal life and whoever has believed in the Lord Jesus Christ shall return back to eternal life and when we have prayed on [Music] Mondays there's been a couple of brothers and sisters here that have given testimony and if you would come to me and ask if you can say a couple of those testimonies I would say that we were very short on time to be able to express all of them so we just want you to know that the prayers that we do are not in vain and it and it has been three years and I said say unto the Lord Lord why do the sick get healed why are there so many healings and Lord please uh don't forget about me and he told me in a dream I'll take it away but I'll put another one on and I say oh God no just as I am [Music] in other occasions I'm I'm happy just the way I am all every man that's called has a stumbling Stone before them and he showed me St Paul and various people even unto Jesus they told them you who healed the sick why don't you heal yourself and they just told him that and so then who am I to change the word of God I only believe that if I pray for the sick the demons will obey because that's what they were made for go and preach the gospel to every living creature he that believeth and was baptized shall be saved and who didn't shall be condemned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils to speak in new tongues and if they should eat any deadly thing it should not harm them and upon the sick they shall lay their hands and they shall be healed do you believe it Brothers if anybody if there's anybody here who God has answered prayer here and your brother your sister your son and yourself mind raising your hand because of the Grateful one thanks God there was a sister that once came from Durango and was here on a Monday and she gave a testimony that she was healed from cancer but over the phone uh and it was a tremendous testimony because the the doctors had given up all hope on her and she was healed in the manner that doctors couldn't even explain it and we have so many of those and the past week or so the last person that was here from she gave us testimony that she was delivered from a demon that was tormenting her with fear of panic and God delivered her and she was here visiting us she's a family member of one of our uh members of the congregation and So within the past three years we have used every Monday from 10:00 a.m. to 11: a.m. and so in that matter this is just an invitation for anybody who would like to visit us Monday mornings only one time I failed and that was because of a misunderstanding of reporting themselves but I have fulfilled every Monday for the past three years and being here and so we give all the honor and glory to our Lord Jesus Christ and I want to tell you one thing because of time I can't say everything but I do want to say one thing that we have to Crown our ourselves with that Divine love that we may reach up to that point that you can pray for your enemy for that who that person who persecutes you who speaks evil of you how many of us are willing to lift up our prayer and ask the Lord to forgive us for not forgiving our enemies or for not asking for a blessing for our enemies brother T you're crazy well that's the type of sincerity that has to be in the believer that we can recognize that our prayer is something really special if you can forgive your enemies you are are part of God's seed you are a child of [Music] God I pray in the mornings or at nights the first thing I do is pray for my sons and daughters for my children my grandchildren my great-grandchildren my brothers and church and all those beloved brothers that live far off for our deacons and pastors I don't do it to try to show off but I do it considering the kind of pressure that they're all in because a church is the same as a home the same thing and just consider what would what would you do if the pastor how he has treated his home how he has managed his home that's how he would manage a church job was rightness was righteous and upright and he would pray for his children for any that would have possibly committed sin and that's the way that we have to do it with our children I don't know I have six children I lift up my hands and I pray for them asking for Mercy for them forgive them Lord for their sins for their mistakes and whatever they may have done for my kids I claim them Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in that same manner each and every one of you should do it at home and love should be unto that perfect love that which is going to Crown the pyramid you're not going to be crowned with so much intelligence you're going to be crowned by faith may the Lord bless you and thank you may the Lord bless our brother Tanis and may the Lord give him more strength we've come to the part of dismissing the service but not before giving you a couple of announcements just a quick reminder that our Wednesday service doors open at 700 p.m. and our service starts at 7:30 p.m. and this Friday the 22nd of March uh we will be having a youth night once again so we can have a special service for the Good Friday on the 29th of March Amen Let Us bow our heads loving Heavenly Father we give you thanks once again for the Sunday that you have provided for [Music] us to be able to start another week and what a better way than to come and worship your name we thank you for what we were able to hear this morning we ask that you help us and that it may be something beneficial into our walk and waiting until the day that you come back for [Music] us we ask that you dismiss us from this [Music] place but never from your presence Lord and may your presence be with us wherever we may go we ask you all of this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen may the Lord bless you until the next service [Music] [Music] [Music] ie [Music] [Music] fore so [Applause] [Music] for make [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] fore
