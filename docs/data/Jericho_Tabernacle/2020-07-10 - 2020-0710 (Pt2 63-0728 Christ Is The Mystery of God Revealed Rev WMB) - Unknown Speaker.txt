TRANSCRIPT
========================================
they were gathered in the upper room all praying in his knee baptized with the Holy Ghost and power for service game now what he did for them that day he'll do for you the same I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that all the King say though these people may not claim to be or boast of worldly fame they have all received their Pentecost baptized in Jesus name and their telling now both far and wide his power is yet the same I'm so glad [Applause] I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm so glad that I can say [Music] now come my brother seek this blessing that will cleanse your heart from sin that will start the joy bells ringing and will keep your soul on flame oh it's burning now within my heart Oh glory to his name I'm so glad I can say that's a new one of the [Applause] so I can say one of the [Music] one of [Music] how many's one of them raise your hand oh how glad I am a moat of their pool one of them what [Music] [Applause] [Music] they were gathered in that upper room all praying in his name they was baptized with the Holy Ghost than power for service came now what he did for them that day he'll do for you this I'm so glad [Music] I'm so glad [Music] [Applause] [Music] and since he was made all thing made for all of us all things was made far by him then since that is true we should make our identification should be with him we should be identified ourselves with him because he has identified himself with us we should be identified with him how by living for him not just a confession so many people take a confession see I'll say it's got to this place now are you a Christian I'm Methodist oh that's a long ways to me even making yourself known as a Christian I look like the Methodist does I'm Baptist look what the Baptist does I'm Catholic look what they do see but the only way that you can actually be a Christian is for Christ to identify himself in you how we got some a stinger there I hope everybody on the tape gets that to think you say I'm Pentecostal that don't mean a thing it's Christ identified in you that's when he has recognized you it's a spoke of tongues Devils does too I shouted the Muhammadans Buddhas and everything shouts the Indians scream at the snake dance hey your honor they all do cults clans and everything else screaming holiday holler shouted a baseball game but when Christ is identified in you identifying itself in your christ-like which the word Christian means to be christ-like there is your identification all right now and since he is our identification then we should be identified with him by leading for him notice God has had a three full purpose in this great mystery secret God in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began he's got a three-fold purpose in it and now what we want to grow up on this morning is what is that three full purpose I believe by the help of God who's present and he'll show it to us now if he had this threefold purpose we want to find out what is this threefold purpose the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who covered all space time and eternity he could not is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious how could that great beam that never did began that after you went beyond the cycle of a hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of years of life space and all out into the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was all that is still in but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood or he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son a man that's reason Jesus kept saying the son of man they they didn't know what he's talking about many ever but now you get it he wanted to express himself that was this one of these great threefold purposes wants to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal yourself in Christ secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people now he could do that in Adam and Eve but since separate them so now there had to be some way to get it back again oh oh this this is rich to me just even think of it see see what God's purpose was now why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like that then he would never been able to express his fullness his full attribute because he could be a father there that's true but also he's a savior you say how do you know what he is cause I've had the experience he is a savior and he had to express that in how could he do it only through Christ how could he be a son only through Christ how could it be healer only through Christ think all things are wound up in that one person Jesus Christ oh my when I think of it I just see the nominations passed off the scene everything you're just going to when I see God's great purpose revealing himself and having first to reveal himself in Christ the fullness of the Godhead bodily and then to bring that wholeness of Godhead bodily into a people that he could have the premises the oversight the leading another other tonight if you didn't get the tape I appreciate one night on a prisoner of Jesus Christ Paul a prisoner see when God gets you to be his prisoner then you can't do nothing but what the Spirit says do Paul with all these great interlinks he taught he was taught by Germania to be a great priest or rabbi Sunday and he had high ambitions he was intellectually a great man great authority great man in the nation but he had to sacrifice every bit of it to become part of the word to express Jesus Christ he known what it was to say he had a notion some place some brother to call him but he was forbidden by the spirit to do his own will oh if if people have spiritual can pick that up hey he was forbidden to do his own will he only could do the spirit for bedmi he was a prisoner to Christ then there's some fortune teller one day who you know Paul no D had power to cast that devil out but he could only do it as God willed it day after day she followed e crying out a dream but one day the spirit gave him permission then he rebuked her the spirit that was in her the he known what it was to be a prisoner Moses he's intellectuals he had to lose him in order to find Christ to be a prisoner then when God got all the world beat out of him and all this mighty man that he wasn't standing the prison that a pillar of fire that day he was found speechless he didn't even couldn't even talk he said God had a prisoner then see you won't try it to your own searching then God had him do this man or dying with power another thing he could go down there and he said Lord I've told Pharaoh what you said and he wasn't there he said then take this thigh Rock God speaking that's God's Word go out there and point it towards the east he called for flies and flies come into creation because he had a prisoner that pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing nobody else could turn him knowing he was a complete presser in the cheese of god's word bound up only to dust south along oh god can gave prisoners like them now that's when he can express the preeminence insisting he he's got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but Christ you get one of me all right that's secondly first to express his self completely gone in Christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride - he could have the premise to express himself through them all right and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its riding position that fell by sin by the first Adam back to where you've walked in the cool evening with his people talk with them fellowship with him and now sin and death had separated them from his presence and he's in power expression you read it before the foundation the world to express all of his is his attributes what he was there for if any Trinitarian here we'll just let yourself loose a minute you can see that Father Son and Holy Ghost is not three gods it's three attributes of the same God its expression father he wasn't who want to be a father he was a father he was the son and he is the Holy Ghost and the father the Holy Ghost is the same spirit don't you see you get it not three gods the devil told you then things to make an idolatry out of you it's one God expressed in three attributes to be father to be Savior to be son to be healer see is this expression I want to push just a little bit so that even people listening to the tape will get the idea that can see it would take me around around that clock just each one of those subjects but I hope I make it clear enough that you can see what I'm coming to thank God expressed in Jesus Christ who was both Father Son and Holy Ghost the fullness of the Godhead Bali now the complete fullness of the Godhead Bali dwells in his church the premises all that God was he poured into Christ all Christ was poured into the church the believers not denomination we'll get to that in a few minutes and it'll take it out of your mind forever show you what caused is that by the help of God if he'll just permit it to it what's his purpose now express himself as the Sun see and now that in here might draw the fullness of the Godhead bodily I've got clashes laying here right before me thing that all through the scripture that's what God purpose was then through this life of the Sun is cross the blood it says you're of his cross that he might reconcile to himself about a bribe which is Eve 2nd Eve and God given in a pipe I could hit Moses and all of the same thing he did in Adam and Eve given a type that they were Christ and the bride he is the second dad in the church as the second Eve and as long as the second Eve compromises against the word is she doing the same thing the first Eve did kind of say it well it was for some other age we'll get to that in a few minutes whether he said that it was for another age how can it be another age when he is the same yesterday today and forever but God has purpose that and heated from the eyes of the prudent and wise and reveal it to the predestinated babes who are predestinated to receive it that's reason washed down to the age whenever that light hits something turn it away and flashed it away and great intellectuals and I'm great priest standing there there's rabbis from great teachers authority like the different ones like Nicodemus named the man polished his scholarship you couldn't even understand it and that was great priest stood out there and rabbis you were taught net word my baton noted intellectually and he said you are of your father the devil and it is work she'll do think of it holy man you could put your finger nowhere on their life or their father's life or their grandfather's life or the great great-great great-great-grandfather's live if it did they died and shame is stoned to death but he understands Jesus calling that group a bunch of Devils religious people how Oh the great revelation now now to restore back his kinship to bring back now he had to let them get lost you understand it he had to let them sin put him on Fremont he he could not make them sin and remain God and then punished him for something he made him do but when he put man on partnership with him then let man act as a free moral agent he the same thing he's got you on today see he you act any way you want to your free moral agent so therefore if he put the first like that he has to put the second like ideas put everyone like that or he acted wrong in the first place but everybody is on the same basis now noticing and bringing that back and let that man do that and knowing that he would do it nobody would do it but wanting to do it displayed his answer do that Savior and the whole purpose that is left in Jesus Christ to become God himself to take the penalty of his own law death the died to redeem the life that was lost by rejecting him when Eve went away from the word she went away from her mate and when the church goes away from the word to a denomination she rejects and commits fornication with the world of man's wisdom rejecting the authority of God's Word that sound clear the Bible said committing spiritual fornication any word in the Bible that's rejected or is any self interpretation put to it it's absolutely rejecting and committing adultery against the God that is your husband and an adulteress in every interstate kingdom of heaven we know that now see that's what Eve done at the first place I noticed again now what's this threefold purpose manifest itself in Jesus tries to come into the body by Jesus Christ to have the preeminence as to what restore back eating bringing back that which love that's the only thing out of order all the rest of these things was in order but he had to let put man on free moral agency the fall so that he might be a savior to display what city see his attribute of Savior something had to be lost and the very thing that man fell and become lost he become the savior of that taking his own law and he could not do it is that great Jehovah that covered all his face time he could go in he had to become a man and he took kinship with the man that was lost a man and becoming flesh I'm excited but I'm not something inside God he came from God and he come me to take my sin upon him that he might make me him hey man back to his great purpose of sons and daughters of God for he is a Eternal Father that attribute was any see so if that had to be displayed now see the whole threefold purpose see to express himself he wants to become right the world is lost now he has to express himself in a man to become a savior through the reconciliation of the blood from his cross I had to become that to die in order to save and to bring yourself back into the church to have the preeminence in his church I remember it can not end will not and never will be and never has been a denomination he has to have the parameter system he is the word hey man how can any creepy injected in itself it turns a church into a prostitute to take any man's words of any creed or any denomination if it quickly is marked in revelation 17 as a and harlots the Roman Catholic Church being the and the Proust is being a harlot exactly as clear as any person could read it we've come through the church ages and you see that note those tapes if you desire exactly then anything that jordans herself with a Creed outside of the Bible is the in the side of God done the same thing II did got away from the word which is Christ oh my all right now we see his mystery he had hid in his mind before the foundation of the world I would just like to read a little bit let's just read it if you got plenty time we will read it now let's just all turn just for one reading anyhow to the book of Ephesians and let's begin at the the first chapter of the Ephesians to read an hour as a Sunday School lesson goes on on this tree full manifestation of Christ let's read Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God now watch it's not addressed to the world but to the Saints which are an emphasis and to the faithful in Christ Jesus how do you get into Christ Jesus by joining church by birth by one spirit first Corinthians 12 we are all baptized into one body all right that's one he's talking to that any address the outside world we can't talk to the sinner on this cause he knows nothing about it Paul didn't address it to those sinners he said this is two that that group there that's in Christ Jesus grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings we're about in heavenly places in Christ heavenly places all how I wish had time you've got it marked I hear my Bible about heavenly places what is heavenly places heavenly places just for a moment is a believers position in Christ where the believer stands in Christ in heavenly places according as he has chosen us listen close chosen us in him before the foundation of the world when did he choose us before the foundation of the world when his great hidden mystery his great secret he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in what love having or what predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will predestinated there's the mystery he before Christ or anything else is ever on earth you sees great mystery and he chose the bride knowing even fall from disbelieving the word knowing as she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold that word regardless of what all the rest of world had to say about it they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to the church to that great glorious fan now you see his secret what to do you restore fallen Eve as she was a pre figure of the church and I noticed as God opened up the side of Adam and took out Eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his spirit from masculine to finish to finish and put it in Eve took the rib from under his side I may eat out of it so God did the same thing take him out of the side of Christ the blood and the water and Christ is the word and taken the word and making up his Church Eve see back to yourself again you see it now God's great mystery being unfolded that's been hid since the foundation of the world but prefigured it all the way down through how are we find that to heat that he did that here in Ephesians and many other places but that'll give you enough to now down through the ages he has been slowly unfolding this mystery can you see now now down to the how did he what happen in the pre figure now he opened Adam side and took part of his flesh which was Adam to make Eve the bride has to be the word or he is the word she cannot stand on Creed's she cannot stand on denomination she can't stand on good behavior she has to stand alone on the word because she's part of it she was taken from Christ and to be sure that the whole rapture now Luther was a part Wesley was the part the prophets was a part if there aren't a part just in the revelations they was making up the body feet toes arms and so forth until the head which we get to that in a few minutes see that makes the entire rapture it's the body of the word which is crying hey man how does that your loss I don't care how good you are what's your relationship is or what's your fellowship is or what your organization you're lost outside of that word being in you if he abide in me the word my word abide in you then you asked what you will because you in the word the same he has the preeminence he's got the rulership you're you're a prisoner to me the world is dead you have nothing more you see the rest of people living the way they do but yet you do not do it you're a prisoner you're yoked with me my yoke is easy yoke with Christ with his word I do that only which the pleases the Father if you can't believe that I am he then believe the word so perfect notice notice now down through the ages he's been gradually letting us out slowly unfolding the mystery through the prophets and through the times now we can just go on to that expressing himself he spreads himself in Moses look at Moses born in a time of persecution of the children he is born to be a deliverer he was hitting the bullrushes just like Jesus was taken down in Egypt he came out he went up on them out and come back with the commandments Jesus went up to the mountains first sermon Sermon on the Mount come back down with the commandment you ever say them bold times out of Charlotte commit adultery I said you look up on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery lawgiver priest king leader Justin acting expressed itself in Joseph born amongst denomination his brother they hated him without a cause because he was spiritual he saw visions God was with him he could interpret dreams and his brothers hated him he was sold for all by his brother but almost thirty pieces of silver just exactly like him his soul but Judas Iscariot one of his brethren about thirty pieces of silver he stowed into a ditch and supposed to been dead that's right the father and I'm was told that he was dead as told him to this dish taken up and went to the right hand of Pharaoh in the dungeon high suffered there and and there was two saved there butler and the Baker what I'm lost him once a brother now the butler won almost lost and the other stayed just as on the cross when he was in his prison house attacked to the cross for our sins when you become a prisoner one thief was lost and one was saved he just exactly then he become at the right hand of Pharaoh of the king that he dreamed and had the vision he was set at the King's feet and all authority in Egypt was given to him his vision had to come to pass you might have studied of it many times while he was in that prison down there his whiskers growing out and so forth but he studied there someday his vision had to come to pass thought languorous got to heaven as I spoke last night or not before is day night here at the service it has to happen when God says so it's got to happen it's a vindicated prophet and has to come to pass cause it's God's Word and the word comes only to the Prophet the word prophet means a revealer of the divine written word as soon as it does the forth tailor their seer notice and the seer how the one you're telling forth he's divinely vindicated by foreseeing and it comes to pass the therapy one who's prophet will speak to you and tell you certain things go to happen and if it don't happen don't listen to him but if it does happen then I'm with him you better fear Him because I am with you see that's a daggers a vindication every way you know where it's the truth or whether it is God is speaking back through his word to his people by people see God only speaks through man I am the pioneer of the branches a bond doesn't bear fruit the branches talk bears of fruit of the vine notice has always been that way now we find Joe then that when no man could touch her come to Farrell without first seeing Joseph no man can come to the Father all about the Sun I want Joseph left the throne the sound of trumpets every knee bow Joseph is coming forth lorry someday every knee will bow and every tongue will confess when he leaves the throne of his father see to come forth everybody will he's a son of God either he was too late then do it now now we notice that to the types we could take even David as a spoke of a while ago going off his throne rejected by his own people going up the same mountain Mount of Olives as is going over to his prison he was going to his prince the house because he was rejected of his brethren and all these old people he went up weeping that was the Spirit of Christ in him to be rejected as you looked up over Jerusalem and weapons that Jerusalem how awful a rejected King eight hundred years later the son of David stood on Jerusalem up there above the real son rejected and wept over Jerusalem it said now your hour has come although say he's typing just in time but yet the mystery was here then man didn't know what they were doing they only knew that they were led by the spirit to do something now holding it back in the last days for the great revelation but expressing it express himself in Moses and David and Joseph and Elijah and on down through you he could take each one of those prophets and bring their lives on shore to express Jesus Christ perfectly exactly yet never giving his secret in full waiting for make it known in the last days waiting for it to be fully comprehended see before he could express it if he told the whole thing because the Bible is written in mysteries Jesus thanked the Father for the that it was ruled in mysteries now the coming of the Lord is in mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he's coming see and so was all the mysteries of God waiting for this last day atrás already been completed any reveals and shows what he's done although my never gave us mr. evil it's just like this comparing the seven seals now when God used Martin Luther for the coming out for that first church of that church age and want to use John Wesley and he grassy brought them out and was revealing in them that church age when we went goes back to the Bible now I find out but in the last days the reason that was such a cutting of her men disdain that he spoke of hearing shoulder was seven thunders and looking life my life magazine impact that circle a cloud and light there that they could not understand and don't know it yep but here telling go there and wait for these mysteries to be revealed in here months before it happened and then it happened exactly the way he said it would do did you notice in that picture even that arranged on the right when he's being the paralyzed coming down with his wings back his head sitting sideways there it is right there in a picture yes exactly months before two haven't told here that he's going to bring the body of believers together to reveal take up them lost in here come well Luther through he only preached justification just pound it away and that age he didn't know what the age was here come Wesley to it he found his age to see a lot of Al Falls come from it the other churches raised them and yeah come Pentecost patently they organized went right back into death again as we get to in a few minutes right back into death and then comes a revelation of the mystery to reveal what's all been about were these little doctrines like Luther brought out catechism and everything else and Wesley brought this that and the other and these other things man Pentecost brought organization just the same and Father Son Holy Ghost baptism things not knowing any difficult then come back in the last days to pick up all these mysteries and clearly explain it ever repeal it why it's all the last days when this great mystery that God had in his heart is being revealed you get it if you fail come back to this tape again I don't know how much longer I'll be with you remember this is the truth of thus saith the Lord it's the truth it's the scripture like the seven mysteries of the seven light seals and mysteries of them the seals have done been broken ever age had come down and there they left a lot of scattered and God not willing that it should be scattered he comes back and picks up those things those doctrines I started and brought it on how to reveal the whole thing same thing he's doing i and revealing a mystery of Christ Holly was God's three-fold purpose for the church oh my Lydia not reveal reveal Webster says is to make no one make no one an especially Webster says in divine truth that revelation means the revelation it is Christ's way of making himself known to his church how we're going to say now brother bang you're just saying this no we won't say just say this I noticed he made itself known to Peter now if you want to mark this down and we're gonna read it we will read it if you want to and st. Matthew 16 15 and 17 are quoted when it comes to the Mount Transfiguration he says who this man say i the son of man am some says all they think you're Elijah and some says you're one of the prophets Jeremiah sometime but that wasn't what he asked he said who do you think that I am now now there's the church he's talking to what does man think I am today he's the philosopher this social religion he's a good man we believe his teachings right it's the subject to be lived by I think it makes us all better if we did we are to have our churches or so forth that's the Santa Clause like a Santa Clause story it's not expressions of some church that we should express some it's a life that you don't live yourself that he comes in you and lives by itself and you become a prisoner to any human intellectual being at all you're led by the spirit how do you know now you say I might know I was losing my mind maybe a mass losses in mine does that but if you have the mind of Christ Christ expresses himself through you shows that it's him and not you not lost your mind some people under illusions of things goes out and becomes insane well that we know that's wrong that's the devil trying to impersonate the real thing before he gets here always a bogus thing but a real man is to lose his own thoughts and his own thinking not come up blindly like that no sir you come up with your right senses and Christ takes you over and expresses itself and out to the world you're an insane person now if you're insane you're actually insane then there's nothing the devil teeth.take you in complete control you make you do everything contrary to this word but when Christ takes you over he'll express that word I do that cause hits him he is the word then you can see the expression of Christ not some illusion of some sort but a real genuine Christ expressing himself right through you how beautiful how long he said who do you say I am he's asked in the church is 12 out of the millions of that day yes 12 his church in the millions in the days of Noah yes eight and he said as it was in the days of Noah so would it be in the coming of the Son of Man we're eight souls were saved I don't say go be eight say now I don't get that all wrong I never said that I don't know how Mays be gonna be saved in that that's the last moment to do rapture that little group it'll be a small group I'll tell you there or Strait is the gate and there is way but few there will be they'll find it but when the great ransom body through all ages comes up and that's gonna be a great throne there revelation 7 expressive great number which no man could number through all the ages has come up them it's walked in the light of the Bible as far as it was revealed to them and now we know that Wesley had more light than Luther did we know Pentecost outshine Wesley see certainly does because it just gradually let loose as it did down the profits and so forth it was perfectly made knowing the Godhead bodily in Christ and now the Christ in the church is just being made no the whole thing is a revelation of God to take heed back to her right position a game with her husband noticing God is the husband of the church and the church is his bride now Peter when he called said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God and what blessed art thou simon barjona says which means son of Jonah think blessed art thou for flesh and blood never reveal this to you you never learned it from some school but my father which is in heaven has revealed you notice what he said to him upon this rock that's Peter the predestinated seed of God that had received the slide and giving the keys to the kingdom upon this rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ is he's the full manifested God upon this rock not a Father Son and Holy Ghost and him being the second person upon this rock I'll build my church and the gates of Hell will never shake it down never prevail against it I'll build my church upon this Ark a revelation of Jesus Christ look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation the Christ life in you makes him the center of the revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing me what God's trying to do what is the new birth then you'd say brother Bram what is new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen not you join the church you shuck a hand you done something different you said a Creed you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it's Christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's Christ in you that is the revelation that the church is built upon you say well I'm a Lutheran I'm a Baptist I'm presbyterian that don't mean what don't mean that to God not a thing not a snap of your finger what is it it's Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself see that's God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws can and fulfill his law by death Christ God died in flesh in order to condemned sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the Word of God and not swap it like he did for intellectual conceptions of man said that's Christ's idea that's God's idea the new birth reveal system and if a man says he's born again and try to place these promises of Christ in his last days to some other age making him Christ's gesture but not today then that man or that person has been in a delusion by Satan you know that man says that he believes that and it doesn't manifest itself through him Jesus said in mark 16 these signs shall follow them to believe and all the world ever aged casting out Devils and speaking with tongues and and all these great manifestations of gifts that would follow that they shout not pay maybe they ought to they will and heavens and earth will pass away but his word long so it's Christ expressing himself in the individual whether he's intellectual or whether he's he's don't know his ABCs half the Apostles didn't know but they know Christ they never taken heed to Peter John knowing and they had been out of some seminary they said they'd taken heat and notice that they've been with Christ when they healed the lame man thing at the gate they know they had been with Christ the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now why are you gonna do and get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressed it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making the word manifest oh if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture go when it knows what it is now notice you say brother Brannon but yes it is - it is the truth did you notice Paul never knew Jesus physically Paul never knew you the only way that Paul knew him was by our revelation by a vision is that right Paul only knew Jesus by the revelation just like Peter did Peter had seen in flesh but he didn't knowing by flesh or Jesus said soul flesh and blood didn't reveal at you he my own life did reveal at youth but my father which is in heaven has revealed upon this rock I build my church Peter did knowing by flesh man walked and handling and everything else Paul had something greater than any other apostles did he they say well I I've got more of a revelation you Paul because you know I'll walk with him I went fishing with him one day I heard him talk you set the boat with me and actually told me let's go over here fishing this place would get more fish and we did it think think we see him do things but Paul saw him after he was dead buried and rose again and expressed himself in the pillar of fire that led the children of Israel knowing Paul being a Jew would never called that Lord and that's either seen the expression he was back the same yesterday and forever he said Paul in other words I'm the same God today that it was Jesse Here I am in the same light the pillar of fire that Moses talked to in the burning bush no wonder he could separate the law from grace over the book of Hebrews he met that same pillar of fire he said I'm Jesus whom you persecute yesterday in the same manner the same pillar of are expressed himself indicating himself to see revealing the mystery of God that's been hidden since the foundation of the world said Paul only Newton doing by revelation Peter doing by revelation he walked with him company therefore you can set this word I just said that he was the word now a scholar can sit down and read that word til he get his tie your mind up in anyway see if he wants to do it cause he's smart brilliant get a Catholic priest we're not so much that there's a real good trained theologian in the Bible rather a Baptist or a Presbyterian or something he'll make you think that you don't know nothing when it comes to talk what see they cause that he has no team in the flesh the word but the only way you're saved is by knowing by revelation if I can take I'm taking the Presbyterian doctrine and tie you Pentecostal you won't know I take the Baptist doctrine and show you pinnacles a million things that you know nothing of right but that's not it that's not his church that's not his church his church is himself revealed man do you sit and expressed by the word itself that he is gone how can you say father son Holy Ghost and be baptized neither me how could you say you know Jesus Christ he's the word when he's not a scripture in the Bible there's not a place where anybody was ever baptized in the name of Father Son Holy Ghost and you and you Jesus only people just using the name Jesus for baptism I'm personally acquainted with four or five Jesus is myself so you see what your denominations lead you into that's the darkness expression of King who brought fruits in instead of blood but the revelation comes to the blood through Jesus Christ who is the blood of God created blood in the womb of Mary and Paul knew him but Rev Li that's how we know him today is only the only way you can know it now say I'm Methodist that means nothing I'm Baptist that means nothing I'm Catholic that means nothing but by the revelation that God has revealed the word to you he is the word and the word how you know revealed it lives itself and expresses itself through you o churches has long forgotten that great revelation that's right revelation of the truth they have forgotten they went them now when Luther raised up he was a great man he had the revelation of that day but what happened a bunch of Ricky's got in flat-topped haircuts as we call it today and Rick aerosol them they got around there and the first thing you know it's there that's precious if you only only knew the numerology of the Bible you know what Elvis are Ricky means into the scripture just like why did Jesus say there's nothing to that your name there isn't that name could only come in this last days for this last days people why did Jesus change Abraham's name to Abraham then Sarah - Sarah why do you change a soul to Paul why did you change the assignment to Peter and so forth you see it certainly means something that name could not be spoken til this day that's reason we got this hellish thing we got the earth today the cause of such things the whole human race is corrupted it's it's gone that's why it is notice now he was all right he was in his days Luther and he had the revelation his cities he left look what he did Wesley had a message look what in the old early Pentecostal head net look what they did they got a bunch a man together it's like exactly the same thing that God by grace sent Israel a purifier a prophet a sacrifice and showed himself among them and brought them out of Egypt across the red seas and they wanted at all so they could have great dignitaries they could have something to do into it and what do they do they was left in the wilderness for 40 years to wonder and not what of that organization ever went over Caleb and Joshua stood out and said we were able to take it look at the Word of God every one of them died in the motors and Jesus said they were eternally gone right actually showed his blessings of power their ages like Luther Wesley and so forth Guinea said our fathers eat man in the woods you said and there are everyone dead that's eternal separated from God their carcasses perished in the wilderness thing they're dead I'm the bread of life they come from God out of heaven they couldn't see it they just couldn't see it all right churches long forgotten they accepted intellectual message intellectuals membership knowledge instead of the revelation of the truth of the word now look here they say today do you believe that God Commission is going all world heal the sick and preach the gospel and cast out devils oh yes I suppose that right but you see a lady told me the other day she said what all the churches aren't harmony I said there isn't one up in harmony with the other there's Catholics standing there I said how about you you're a Methodist Ness Catholic are you harm me in one another I said this Pope countered United together that's a good thing for all that kind of people but the Church of God has nothing to do with it it's out from the whole bunch yes sir you ought to unite that together and one believes in something the other Methodist takes Franklin the Baptist taking Merson both I'm denying the Holy Ghost in its fullness of the power they said we receive the Holy Ghost when we believe the Bible said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe yeah they say we're the Catholic Church we started early we did this the method say we are based upon the Bible jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe now where's that works in I do should you do also every creature every person who believes any not words of that that's his words heaven through earth will pass away but my words shall never fail now where's it at hey oh I just show what is it it's a hybrid condition look here you take a big fine grain of corn it's high bird and you take a hybrid corn it's a pretty car but you paint it what are you get a little stock comes up like this and turns yellow and wheels down that's why ever denomination is wife hybrid but man's words mixed with God's words it'll come up to the signs and winters and what Jesus said about believing the word it turns yellow and say we can't accept and go back just like all the mother of spies did it what we're looking at Canaan they come over there so we look like grasshoppers Sodom we can't take them the Amalekites oh all these what they're gonna do and they went back and Canada Joshua Ian thoroughbreds a man by the Word of God no God said I do that man they said we're able to take it depends on where you're born from if you're born to the Word of God God's Word has a preeminence as in his church that's what He died for that's his purpose that he might be able to achieve to have his preeminence working in his church that the Word of God shine forth first no matter what anything else looks like I don't care if the intellectual says this tethered has nothing to do with it God's Word said so and we were more than able to take it my five picks at my church to minister told me said I'd be preached into four pokes to the church I said I'd preach that word said so we can do it amen oh yeah the excuse themselves for this see that's why they're blind to the message of the end time this last days when God is proving himself they try to class it as some kind of Spiritist or some Oh what would I call it some mineral an allusion or something on that order see they they try to make it something that it is and just like they did when he was here but Jesus here they called him Beelzebub a fortune-teller now they say it's kind of like a middle telepathy see when they know that he could stand there and look upon the people and discern the very thoughts is in their heart the Bible said so what does not Hebrews the fourth chapter says the Word of God is quicker sharper than a two-edged sword and concerned the very thoughts of the mind and he was that word and when that word is preeminence in the man the same thing takes place again or it is the word Amen see how you to stumble over this from out there so perfectly plain all right that's why they're blind famous was today's crisis on earth come on they staggered the same way they said he's bills above ear they seen he could do it so they said he's just a he was born to the illegitimate child have an odd fella he's just got possessed for some devil he's a he's the Samaritan over there he's got a devil in he met hi does that Jesus said I'll forgive you for that he calling the Word of God the works of God an evil spirit he said I forgive you that Sunday the Holy Ghost will come one word against it will never be forgiven neither in this world of the world that is to come or that great day it will not be forgiven so I see that's written plain in the scripture so when people come to that day no matter how intellectual how bigger denomination they belong to is condemned they have to be they blaspheme the Holy Ghost Harley and Holy Roller in something that had a nun taystee name or something that I got in God's church had to bear it all the time even Paul before gripper sat in the way that's called heresy which means crazy today people say it's a denomination it's Jesus Christ a new birth revealed in you and he has a preeminence is that he might express his words and anything that he's promised in his last days he can bring it to pass through his body as he's working hey man it's just exactly the Word of God made manifest notice me all right same as in the days of Christ God holds a key to this revelation of Christ himself you believe that schools of theology can never find it jesus said so if you want to read it now in st. Matthew 11:25 and 27 I think the old father god of heavens to earth now it's hid this from the eyes or wasn't pretty reveal it to babes such as would learn me see I don't care look at them scholars of that day those Jews very fine man their organizations a Pharisees Sadducees and Herodians and whatever they might be see all the great organizations that Jesus said you're a blind you lead the blind well there's this speak of you you have ears and can't hear it eyes that you can't see cause Isaiah said this in the spirit therefore the God of heaven has blinded your eyes you're doing like Eve did accepting the intellectual side and know nothing of the Spirit of God therefore folks they all fall in the ditch both the leader in the blind to the leader will fall with the blind cause he's blind also the leader fall blind leading a blind they're both fall in the ditch and God don't hold this key express the same thing in a previous scripture that a while ago when I read it when he said who does man say i the son of man am and Peter said I like the Christ the Son of the Living God he said blessed art thou simon son of jonas flesh and blood never reveal this to you my father which is in heaven up on this revelation here I'll build my church the gates of Hell will never prevail against it see now you see so therefore there's no school no theologians no teachings of the Bible among any school that knows anything about it they cannot know nothing about it's impossible from the annoying thing about it God has hit the census of known you from the very elected teachers and everything else it's a personal individual affair with the person that Christ is revealed to them if you say he's been revealed to me and then the life that Christ produced here in the Bible that same life as in him does not produce itself in you then you've got the wrong revelation if I put a life of a pumpkin into the life of a pear tree it would bear pumpkins father fruits you shall know them exactly right it's a first you put out a tree a grapevine and it put out a bunch of grapes the first shoot it put out brought grapes the next you brought out lemons the next two brought out pears the next we brought out apples there's some kind of grafting a fairy in there experienced own life over denominational bear life of itself but if that ratio by never puts out another a shoot it'll bear greats like I did the first time life the life of Jesus Christ ever puts out another body of believers it'll bear the fruit that the first one did they'll write a book of Acts behind me the city wide so you wanna mean you just can't get away from it it's the life of Christ in you been injected in you by the Holy Spirit itself living its life through you by leaders of the blind notice God holds this key alone no theologian can tell you it's not known as hid from them they know nothing about so the schools when you say I got a pH L LD you only met you to me now I believe it to God and do any real true believer that means you're just that much farther away just back on God is not knowing about education he's not knowing about how to explain it God is long a simplicity and a revelation of Jesus Christ in the most illiterate person they not your theology it's a revelation of Jesus Christ upon this rock I'll build my church no other rocks accepted no other things except tonight no other ramen Rock nor the Protestant Rock no other school Lord or nothing but exactly the revelation of Jesus Christ to the new birth he barns there and he checks his own life in your life is gone in the life of Christ is projecting itself through you with the premises to the people that they see the very life and works and signs and wonders that he did is doing the same thing through you outside of that the rest of us not even called to it all watch God's great revelation unfolding by lack of this revelation is why we have so many different divisions among us and so much mockery so much division among this is because of people lack that revelation they like that revelation the teachers Paul after his great revelation of Christ said in first Corinthians the second chapter be sure to read that as you're writing down watch oh he said I ever come to you with wisdom look at that man who did have the wisdom look at man who had the scholarship I never come to you with them kind of a word first Corinthians the second chapter of first craisins I wish this read oh how can you stand a minute let's read this verse attune I just like to read you so you you at beacon it gets even the people on the tape to turn back to it anyhow give them a chance first Korean teens the second chapter listen this great apostle here Paul the intellectual servant of God let's look at here I Paul when I come to you came not with excellency of speech of wisdom declaring to you the testimony of God I never said I I'm dr. so-and-so well I'm determined not to know anything among you say Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling my speech and and my decision was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and power of the power there see there's the gospel jesus said go you know a little preach the gospel did say go teach he said go preach in other words demonstrate the power and these signs shall follow them just teaching doesn't do it it takes the actual spirit itself demonstrating these signs listen is that's your face you're not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God oh my see to change the man not in what I can explain away and say he's not the same when he is the same if I do that it shows to me it's surely a man tell me that which showed me he don't have the revelation the three full revelation of God thank al Adha be it him weakness among you that are perfect yet we're not with the wisdom of the world but all the princes of this world that come to nought but we speak the wisdom of God in mystery see the threefold mystery of God even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew not a priest rebar rabbis for me or anything knew anything about it for hair day they would have not crucified the Lord of glory you said you're wrong about brab eyes and preachers there who crucified Him all on and on and on we could go read it Oh save time cause he got just not getting laid yet but we just got plenty here to say if the Lord will help us now lack of this now and Paul this great intellectual man never tried to express his great theological terms upon the people he humbly accepted the word of the Lord and he lived the word sort Express - he lives soul or so godly until they see Jesus Christ he needs too much so they wanted his handkerchief they're taken laid upon the sick there's a life of Christ now watch them - although you see Elijah done that long time ago ladies stick but all as the days of Elijah now the world thought that the intellectual priests and things in churches of that day thought that but then believers they know different they seen the revelation of Christ that was in Elijah same thing was in Paul express the same kind of life cause he was a prophet he he foretold things are happen exactly the way it was and they know that was God's identification of a prophet and they know that he was God's prophets you could shake him from it at all even when they seen Peter foretell those things that come to pass they said just let his shadow pass over me that's the church that's the ones that believe it yes turn it was revealed by high policy the calls are I got a pH ll D so forth they believe me no he said I forgot all those things of wisdom of man's that had to die not knowing in the power of his resurrection that's what I come to you that with a demonstration of God's power what was it making Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever the same works that Jesus did Paul did the same and they seen God the great father that had demonstrated the burning bush had demonstrated to Paul and here it was being demonstrated he's the same in every age gob threefold manner yesterday today and forever what Redeemer in his church premises in the coming to you you see this is perfect as it can be all notice the Holy Ghost is the holy revealer of the divine revelation Christ we're marching [Music] we're G see oh we're alive [Music] we're [Music] see let those refuse to say [Music] but chill kay ever [Music] I may speak Java may speak their job [Music]
