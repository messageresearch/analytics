[38:35] a man amen but this is here in the
[38:38] natural
[38:39] natural and i would love for the young
[38:41] people to memorize those steps
[38:47] we left last time on speaking on the
[38:50] wedding vows
[38:55] we we read the wedding vows that the
[38:56] minister reads to the couple
[39:12] wisely uh saviamente and all those
[39:15] definition definitions he told us
[39:17] amen amen
[39:19] no one should come into this without
[39:21] advice
[39:24] we should come in with this with the
[39:25] fear of god
[39:36] amen
[39:37] now we're going to continue where where
[39:39] we left off almost
[39:41] going to continue where what a young man
[39:43] should be looking for
[39:47] and the message choosing of a bride
[39:50] brother branham says
[39:52] now for it's becoming if a christian
[39:55] would choose a wife
[40:01] he ought to choose a genuine born-again
[40:04] woman
[40:07] regardless of what she looks like
[40:11] that's what she is
[40:13] what makes her lo
[40:15] and then again
[40:17] that reflects his own godly character
[40:21] reflection
[40:31] for his family will be raised by such a
[40:34] woman
[40:37] for the future plans of his home por los
[40:39] planes polos planes futuros de solar if
[40:42] he marries one of these little modern
[40:44] requests
[40:47] sex queens uh modernized
[40:50] what could he expect de que puede
[40:52] esperar what kind of home could a man
[40:54] expect to have que tipo de garpo
[40:57] if he marries a girl that ain't got
[40:59] enough moral about her she said
[41:03] to stay
[41:04] home and take care of a house
[41:07] and wants to go out and work on
[41:09] somebody's office
[41:11] what kind of housekeeper will she be
[41:15] you have babysitters and everything else
[41:19] so if you if you chew and you break down
[41:21] what brother branham just said
[41:24] analysis
[41:25] is something very very important
[41:28] he said he should choose a genuine
[41:30] born-again christian he says
[41:46] of what he wants in the future
[41:50] brother branham said
[41:51] he went to a christian man's office one
[41:53] day
[41:56] and he had christian music on
[41:58] christianity and he had a bunch of
[42:00] crucifix on the wall
[42:04] and he had a picture of his wife in the
[42:06] office
[42:08] she had she was dressed in a certain way
[42:12] but it wasn't a christian way
[42:15] she had makeup on and so forth
[42:18] and brother brown says i don't care what
[42:20] that man tells me
[42:23] if he has christian music on
[42:25] christianity he dresses like a christian
[42:28] christian
[42:42] it shows me that he is not a christian
[42:46] christian i'm going to say that again
[42:48] when i see his wife juan dobellos was
[42:51] supposed to act a certain way
[42:54] a certain way
[42:56] it doesn't matter what that man tells me
[42:58] i'm important
[43:00] he's showing me his heart
[43:03] amen amen have you heard brother brown
[43:05] say that before i don't know either
[43:06] brown you see that
[43:08] says the woman
[43:10] reflects the man reflection
[43:12] whenever you want to see a man
[43:15] look at his wife me that's supposed to
[43:17] be how she is
[43:18] look at her character
[43:20] if she always wants to fight
[43:24] that's how
[43:31] if you want to see the stage or the
[43:34] level that church is in sierras
[43:37] iglesia it is by the woman in the church
[43:42] if you want to see the level of what
[43:44] that church is at
[43:48] if you want to see how where jericho is
[43:50] at
[43:52] look
[44:02] amen amen amen
[44:05] do you love the lord amanda senor well
[44:07] you say well brother the sister told me
[44:10] she was born again
[44:14] and the brother told me he was born
[44:15] again
[44:17] how do we know he's born again
[44:20] by their
[44:27] it's something that is tested something
[44:28] that is proven
[44:31] someone that's
[44:32] a man a young man that's born again
[44:48] there's fruits behind what they're
[44:50] saying
[44:52] are you
[44:53] amen you love the lord amen
[44:55] when a man says well look i'm born again
[45:01] i love the lord
[45:14] young man that has the holy ghost
[45:30] that wants to talk to a young lady
[45:34] it doesn't matter how old that man is
[45:39] 16 years old
[45:41] 18 years old
[45:42] 20 years old
[45:43] 22 years old
[45:45] and they're still fighting with mom and
[45:47] dad
[45:49] they're still yelling at his parents
[45:51] they still want to bully his kids his
[45:53] siblings
[45:55] he still wants to fight toe-to-toe with
[45:57] his dad
[46:11] mature enough for a responsibility
[46:16] [Music]
[46:27] it's going to act like a young lady
[46:30] she's going to dress like a young lady
[46:33] not dressed like the modern girls of
[46:34] today
[46:38] when there's young ladies
[46:41] they dress
[46:42] sometimes they have these now there's
[46:44] new modern style where they have shirts
[46:45] that are up to their belly button
[46:53] young ladies shouldn't be showing their
[47:08] so people don't look at them
[47:11] and and the parents
[47:14] they let the daughters dress like that
[47:20] they say what honey it's fine dressed
[47:22] like that
[47:34] the parent knows how they're dressing
[47:36] and let them
[47:50] i'm going to say that again
[47:52] young ladies should dress their age
[47:56] they shouldn't be showing their skin
[48:00] it shouldn't be showing their bodies
[48:03] a young lady should act like
[48:31] listen to the message the invisible
[48:33] union of the bride of christ
[48:41] has been gave given to her a sacred
[48:44] trust
[48:49] sacred trust that they should keep it
[48:53] amen amen
[48:55] well
[48:56] if you go back to that message and study
[48:58] it
[49:00] except three things
[49:03] her sacred virginity
[49:06] her sacred
[49:08] feminism
[49:10] and her sacred motherhood
[49:12] [Music]
[49:14] again three things that god has given
[49:16] the young ladies
[49:19] three sacred virtues
[49:22] that she should keep
[49:24] her sacred virginity
[49:27] her sacred feminism
[49:38] marriage is the oldest institution in
[49:41] the world
[49:53] a woman is entrusted with certain
[49:55] characters
[50:37] the womanhood is speaking of of here is
[50:40] her conduct
[50:44] her character around men
[50:47] not letting every man know
[50:52] and it just says
[50:53] several points
[50:55] not letting every man no deja que todo
[50:59] los sombres
[51:00] now she's been giving three trusts that
[51:02] she should keep
[51:05] her sacred virginity
[51:11] he says well go and test drive it
[51:15] if you guys don't cope together
[51:18] you're not meant to be together
[51:20] but if you guys don't live with each
[51:22] other how do you know he's the one
[51:26] woman should keep her virginity
[51:30] and her womanhood her feminism
[51:33] don't talk like a man no hables don't
[51:35] walk like a man
[51:37] don't dress like a man
[51:39] you you were giving this this this this
[51:42] this virtue
[51:44] to be like a woman
[51:46] and to give to bring forth life
[52:01] she can be forgiven if she defiles them
[52:06] but she cannot be justified in this life
[52:11] it was given to her
[52:13] amen i encourage you to study that
[52:15] message the invisible you you know the
[52:16] bread of christ
[52:20] now i'm going to read another quote here
[52:24] the ram says i think today
[52:27] we got so many divorce cases now
[52:30] divorce
[52:32] we leave the world in america in divorce
[52:34] cases
[52:36] in america
[52:37] we leave the rest of the world
[52:40] the more divorce is here than anywhere
[52:41] else
[52:44] this national
[52:56] and i think the reason of it is
[53:09] what does the prophet say why there's so
[53:11] many divorce cases
[53:26] if a
[53:39] not just look over a pretty set of eyes
[53:43] or big strong shoulders
[53:46] or such as that
[53:48] or some worldly affection because
[53:51] but we'll look first to god
[54:08] a young lady
[54:22] but when the young man approaches her
[54:25] that young lady should pray
[54:28] god is this your plan
[54:31] is this is what you have for my life
[54:34] why it's a serious matter
[55:15] that doesn't mean just because you chose
[55:17] the right person it's not gonna be an
[55:18] argument
[55:58] and if we could study what we're doing
[56:00] is
[56:13] the chapters and so forth
[56:16] that's what you got to do study
[56:20] study yourself
[56:21] study the scriptures
[56:24] young ladies
[56:25] before you get into into marriage
[56:41] a man should pray
[56:53] why should we pray
[56:55] why should we pray earnestly
[57:21] [Applause]
[57:23] will send you to help
[57:36] i differ of what you just said
[57:50] you can choose the wrong card
[58:21] he said he could ruin his life by making
[58:22] the wrong choice
[58:27] i love i i love that god doesn't leave
[58:29] anything out
[58:32] because i don't have to feel anything
[59:02] and he says it said amen but if he knows
[59:06] that he's making a wrong choice
[59:10] that's enough let's go home
[59:13] let's go home
[59:14] that's it yes
[59:18] you want to keep going
[59:20] amen amen but if he knows
[59:24] that he's making the wrong choice
[59:27] and he's marrying a woman that isn't fit
[59:30] to be
[59:44] you told me that it was here
[59:47] you know that she wasn't supposed to be
[59:49] here
[59:50] you marry her anyhow
[59:53] it's your fault
[59:56] but i went with the pastor pastor
[59:58] yes
[1:00:01] yeah that's fine the pastor's gonna give
[1:00:04] you his best advice
[1:00:09] he's only gonna give you what he knows
[1:00:12] but it's
[1:00:35] and knows that he's not fit to be a
[1:00:38] husband to you
[1:00:40] is
[1:00:50] you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly
[1:00:52] pray through it
[1:00:57] don't go through it unless you have
[1:00:59] prayed over the matter
[1:01:02] because if you know that he's the wrong
[1:01:03] one
[1:01:05] and if you know she's the wrong one
[1:01:22] in
[1:01:26] and the church there's no good looking
[1:01:28] people at church
[1:01:31] there's only two young men at church
[1:01:34] there's only three young ladies at
[1:01:35] church
[1:01:46] there's a testimony of a brother that
[1:01:47] marries someone from the world
[1:02:03] we can only base ourselves on god's word
[1:02:07] what the prophet of god told us
[1:02:10] you see ahab was was reigning in israel
[1:02:15] in israel
[1:02:16] over israel and he was the wickedest of
[1:02:19] all the kings of israel
[1:02:23] there had been no king as wicked as ahab
[1:02:27] foreign
[1:02:29] nothing
[1:02:31] being taught
[1:02:51] but he kept continuing to please to
[1:02:53] displease god and everything he did
[1:02:59] although he had a great military system
[1:03:04] and the people had become very
[1:03:05] prosperous under his reign
[1:03:10] you cannot displease god and expect to
[1:03:12] get to get by very long
[1:03:19] you cannot displease god and expect to
[1:03:22] get by very long
[1:03:26] and then in his wedding
[1:04:20] no doubt that jezebel was a beautiful
[1:04:21] woman
[1:04:24] and he had fell for what he had fell for
[1:04:27] what she looked like
[1:04:30] instead of what she was
[1:04:33] that so many people make the same
[1:04:35] mistake today
[1:04:39] we can't base ourselves on testimonies
[1:04:41] of other brothers
[1:04:45] and we're glad that the brother or the
[1:04:46] sister converted their spouse
[1:04:52] but we can't base ourselves on their
[1:04:53] testimony
[1:04:56] we can't based ourselves on that
[1:04:59] we can only base ourselves on god's word
[1:05:03] and the prophet told us
[1:05:06] under no
[1:05:21] one of the others going to be converted
[1:05:24] the unbeliever is going to get converted
[1:05:25] to be a believer
[1:05:28] or the believer is going to be converted
[1:05:30] to be an unbeliever
[1:05:33] but someone is going to get converted
[1:05:36] brother branham said he had failed for
[1:05:38] what she looked like
[1:05:43] instead of what she was
[1:05:46] that so many people make the same
[1:05:48] mistake today
[1:05:52] and you have to the young man should
[1:05:53] pray over this matter
[1:05:57] because whatever you choose
[1:06:00] is going to reflect who you are
[1:06:02] is going to
[1:06:31] amen amen
[1:06:32] it's a very serious matter
[1:06:35] and it's the same thing with christ
[1:06:37] we reflect christ
[1:06:40] the way we behave
[1:06:42] the way we act at home
[1:06:44] the way
[1:07:12] amen
[1:07:14] so so friendship
[1:07:17] what is what is the first stage
[1:07:20] friendship let me start amen
[1:07:22] right let's open up our scriptures to
[1:07:24] first timothy chapter five
[1:07:40] but i think that uh we're going to be
[1:07:42] finishing up pretty soon
[1:07:45] first timothy
[1:07:47] chapter 5 verse 1
[1:07:52] rebuke not an elder
[1:08:06] we see elders at the church
[1:08:12] sometimes the elder comes to you and
[1:08:14] and tells you look i have a piece of
[1:08:16] advice for you young man
[1:08:21] don't rebuke him no no
[1:08:50] treat the younger men as your brothers
[1:08:56] verse 2.
[1:08:57] the elder woman has mothers
[1:09:01] the younger sisters
[1:09:03] with all purity hermanas so the young
[1:09:06] man how should he be treating a young
[1:09:08] sister
[1:09:12] with all purity
[1:09:14] with respect
[1:09:16] don't be disrespecting her no faltered
[1:09:26] even before you get to that friendship
[1:09:27] stage
[1:09:30] the young man at home should be treating
[1:09:32] all the young people young ladies
[1:09:36] with all purity
[1:09:38] don't disrespect them
[1:09:40] and he would tell his he would tell his
[1:09:41] young man his son
[1:09:44] he says
[1:09:46] don't ever do anything to a young lady
[1:09:50] that you don't want a young man doing to
[1:09:51] your sister
[1:09:57] don't ever do something to a young lady
[1:10:00] that you don't want your your a young
[1:10:02] man to do to your sister
[1:10:06] treat them without purity
[1:10:09] they're your sisters
[1:10:11] in christ
[1:10:12] the young ladies to treat the young men
[1:10:14] as brothers in christ
[1:10:18] what kind of friends should we have
[1:10:20] amigos
[1:10:22] let's go to hebrews chapter 10.
[1:10:25] on the 21st 24th
[1:10:29] here it says and let us consider one
[1:10:30] another
[1:10:33] to provoke unto love and to good works
[1:10:38] so what should a friend be doing
[1:10:41] he says provoke say consider to provoke
[1:10:44] not not not to provoke onto anger
[1:10:49] or to do bad things
[1:10:52] but to provoke onto love and to good
[1:10:54] works
[1:10:57] not forsaking the assembling of
[1:10:59] ourselves together
[1:11:03] as the manner of some is
[1:11:06] but exhorting one another
[1:11:08] and so much the more than thomas and you
[1:11:11] see the day approaching
[1:11:14] so we're looking for a christian friend
[1:11:18] what a friend should be doing
[1:11:21] they should be provoking one another
[1:11:22] onto good works
[1:11:30] even though you say brother that's a
[1:11:31] little religious don't you think okay
[1:11:35] i'd rather have list i'd rather have
[1:11:36] them listening to tapes
[1:11:52] good friend
[1:11:54] amigos
[1:11:55] that good friend
[1:11:57] amigo will provoke you to do good work
[1:12:02] it won't provoke you
[1:12:03] to stop doors or to tell you to stop
[1:12:05] coming to church
[1:12:20] one another
[1:12:24] so tell one another look i'm gonna go on
[1:12:25] tuesdays
[1:12:28] we're gonna go on fridays
[1:12:30] even though at the end of the day you're
[1:12:31] gonna go to look at the young lady
[1:12:47] not because there's a young lady that we
[1:12:48] like
[1:12:51] or because of this young man that we
[1:12:52] like
[1:12:54] i only come to church because that young
[1:12:55] man comes
[1:12:56] let's say
[1:12:58] because a young lady comes
[1:12:59] no we should come to church
[1:13:02] with the true
[1:13:20] [Applause]
[1:13:33] and to stimulate to keep congregating in
[1:13:35] the church
[1:13:38] first thessalonians chapter five uh
[1:13:43] verse 11
[1:13:59] therefore encourage one another and
[1:14:00] build each other up
[1:14:05] just as fact as you're doing
[1:14:09] so what what should have again what
[1:14:10] should a friend be doing
[1:14:21] amen amen
[1:14:23] brother branham says now if now if
[1:14:24] there's a true fellowship the man of
[1:14:26] brandon
[1:14:41] muchacho conocer la muchacho and he says
[1:14:43] to her
[1:14:44] he thinks she's so pretty
[1:14:47] and she's found of him
[1:14:50] and they want to have fellowship
[1:14:52] a real fellowship
[1:14:54] before
[1:15:11] and it's based upon the trusses or the
[1:15:13] their pledges to each other
[1:15:18] and i and then holy wedlock
[1:15:21] and then we enter in a lifelong
[1:15:23] fellowship
[1:15:26] but before we can enter in that
[1:15:27] fellowship
[1:15:30] there has to be an agreement first
[1:15:34] i want to re i want to repeat what
[1:15:35] brother branham just said
[1:15:51] because i went to the second step and i
[1:15:52] went to the third stage and i'm already
[1:15:54] married
[1:15:57] that fellowship between one another
[1:16:00] so stay between you
[1:16:03] to become friends to be
[1:16:04] friends and he says before you can get
[1:16:07] into that
[1:16:10] there has to be an agreement
[1:16:13] so no one can enter into anything
[1:16:17] forcefully
[1:16:24] now there's two types of friendships
[1:16:26] that we have
[1:16:28] amigos
[1:16:29] we have the normal or the superficial
[1:16:31] friendship
[1:16:32] normally
[1:16:34] then we have what is called a form of
[1:16:36] friendship
[1:16:38] we're going to give you the definitions
[1:16:40] here
[1:16:41] and i have the definitions up there
[1:16:46] a friend an amigo a person who you like
[1:16:49] and enjoy being with a person
[1:16:54] a person who helps or supports someone
[1:16:57] or something
[1:17:01] and that is what the scriptures that we
[1:17:02] read
[1:17:05] is someone who helps or supports someone
[1:17:07] or something
[1:17:11] someone who encourages you someone who
[1:17:13] builds you up
[1:17:28] we should look for friends that are here
[1:17:30] and are saying beliefs
[1:17:35] i'm talking about friends and and and
[1:17:37] the formal friendship stage
[1:17:42] of course we have friends outside of our
[1:17:44] of our religion or what we believe in
[1:17:50] but when you're looking for someone with
[1:17:52] the intention of marriage or something
[1:17:53] serious
[1:18:06] it's affecting only the outer part or
[1:18:08] the surface of something
[1:18:22] is that we just have there's no there's
[1:18:24] nothing serious that we have between
[1:18:25] each other
[1:18:28] regular friends
[1:18:30] amigos it's only the surface
[1:18:33] there's nothing deep or there's nothing
[1:18:34] serious
[1:18:36] in our friendships
[1:18:42] it's done accordance with rules of
[1:18:44] convention or etiquette
[1:18:49] suitable for or
[1:18:50] constituting an official and important
[1:18:52] situation
[1:19:04] so then that's when we come into the
[1:19:06] form of friendship
[1:19:09] we're no longer they're just the regular
[1:19:10] common friends that are outside in the
[1:19:12] fellowship
[1:19:15] but now there's an intention behind that
[1:19:19] there's something that they have between
[1:19:21] one another
[1:19:23] that they they like there's something
[1:19:25] that they like in each other
[1:19:28] and they want to make it formal
[1:19:31] that was not now not just the surface
[1:19:41] amen amen
[1:19:43] now what do you do in this stage
[1:19:46] what do we do when we become friends
[1:19:47] what do we do
[1:20:12] [Applause]
[1:20:15] there shouldn't be anything like that
[1:20:18] to start confessing to one another
[1:20:21] say i'm going to marry you
[1:20:23] and god gave me a sign that you're the
[1:20:25] one
[1:20:27] that's not that's not the time
[1:20:30] there
[1:20:45] have get to know each other each other's
[1:20:47] characters
[1:20:50] and keep praying and waiting asking god
[1:20:53] to review to you about this young man or
[1:20:55] this young lady
[1:21:09] a lot of people think well we're formal
[1:21:10] friends we're dating now
[1:21:26] there's something that is mutual between
[1:21:27] you two
[1:21:29] so when you guys want to be together
[1:21:33] you can't be together by yourself
[1:21:36] you have to be amongst the youth groups
[1:21:40] there is no such thing as dates
[1:21:44] amen amen do you love the lord
[1:21:47] i want to go on a date with you
[1:21:49] there's no date no no
[1:21:51] there's no dates
[1:21:52] you're just friends
[1:21:54] amigos you only get to see each other
[1:21:55] here in the fellowship
[1:21:58] i hope on sundays evenings we have a lot
[1:22:00] of young people espero domingos
[1:22:05] amen that's where we should see him at
[1:22:07] yeah
[1:22:11] not to be organizing themselves to meet
[1:22:13] at a coffee place
[1:22:17] or to me at the movies
[1:22:19] or anywhere else
[1:22:21] she meet each other over here
[1:22:36] you can't be touching each other
[1:22:39] you're allowed to be each other with the
[1:22:41] youth group
[1:22:43] but they shouldn't be back there in the
[1:22:45] back by themselves
[1:22:48] because you are friends
[1:22:56] amen the scripture that we read last
[1:22:58] week it says it is good for a man not to
[1:23:01] touch a woman
[1:23:47] to the young ladies excuse me
[1:23:51] young man ever does that to you
[1:23:55] you should tell them you better stop
[1:23:57] there
[1:23:58] leave me alone
[1:23:59] that is not christ like es
[1:24:02] you should tell your parents
[1:24:04] tell the pastor
[1:24:06] you're a young man
[1:24:09] i wanted to kiss you on the left
[1:24:11] because a young woman
[1:24:13] has a sacred virtue that she
[1:24:28] tell
[1:25:09] the young lady has to confess to her
[1:25:11] husband
[1:25:12] i did this and i did that oh i did this
[1:25:15] keep yourself as clean and unstable
[1:25:20] don't stain your testimony
[1:25:22] you don't want to tell your wife
[1:26:09] keep yourself clean
[1:26:12] amen amen what we want is that in five
[1:26:15] or ten years from now
[1:26:16] in cinco de la preaching now

[1:27:17] don't let that don't let your parents go
[1:27:19] through that
[1:27:21] don't let your pastor go through
[1:27:23] the pastor
[1:27:24] amen amen you love the lord
[1:27:27] do you love me
[1:27:29] amen amen you love the lord eventually
[1:27:31] you love me
[1:27:34] and i trust that one day it's very soon
[1:27:40] we're closing now
[1:27:42] things that you should do what are the
[1:27:43] things that you should do
