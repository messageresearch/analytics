to turn to Proverbs 22 22 6 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it let us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we we come into your holy presence this this evening father we're not claiming anything this evening we don't have anything good to bring to you Lord but father we come here with an open heart this evening knowing Lord that you are rich in Mercy knowing Lord that all good knowledge comes through you father father and we just ask Lord as we review this little study we just ask that you open our eyes father that you can help each and every person those that are standing those that are in the back and the front father so that we may know how to live good Christian lives father and we can dedicate not only ourselves to you but our family Lord Lord we just ask that you take control of this service speak to the open ears and the Open Hearts this evening in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen amen amen you may be seated for for a few months it's already almost been a year uh we've been studying on um these Green books which is um marriage courtship and dating and uh it's it's been such a a blessing to us I know it's been a blessing to me just just because it's this brother I believe his name is brother Paul durksen Paul he he um put all these quotes together so that he can create a picture H how we should not only approach um the young people should approach dating and courtship but it all goes all the way to marriage and families and it's just all quotes of brother brandham and all uh scripture so this evening we want to review chapter nine um we just finished uh chapter eight which talked about the role of the woman chapter 10 and on we're going to be speaking on how to to look you plan and you pray for the perfect person but before that chapter nine it talks about making arrangements for our children and it it really talks to the parents here how how we need to make arrangements for our children what are the greatest Revelations for me that I saw in the Bible is that my children are not mine they they have been borrowed and I I'm borrowing them they have been given to me for a purpose so so every person that has a child whe whether they're babies or they're already grown up that child was given given to you for a purpose and it reminds me of the story of Hannah how she wanted a child so bad she she almost felt like it was a curse upon her that she didn't have a child and she cried out unto the Lord and she said Lord if you give me this child Lord if you bless me with a a little baby I promise that I will give that child back to you and that's our prayer tonight Lord my children are mine I I have a job to do I have to prepare them because one of these days they're going to go out on their own they're going to do whatever they want to do and it's my job it's the father and the mother's job to prepare the way for them to train them up in in everything that they should go so that if they Veer off one day if they fall one day if if they're older and and they they forget the things of of of their parents it has to come back to them the word of their parents has to come back because the Bible says that everything that they you train up your child to go it will not depart from them brother brandham says in the message taking sides with Jesus now we've got to think of young people we got children most of us people here married man has children well what about them that's coming on so so he's he's saying okay what about those that are going to be taking our place and he gives an example here he said like I used to kick up uh down there about them throwing the C uh those cast Nets on the river and pulling them out the perch and drinks and drunkards and things I've seen them pile up high as the ceiling here big fine perch laying there the stink would be all around the river I went down there as the game watered would make them stop it I got a letter leave them alone what are you what are you going to do it belongs to Kentucky and now Kentucky warning can't uh come over here because he's out of his territory Indiana Warden has nothing to say into it because the water belongs to Kentucky there you are there's nothing that can be done I said I've got a boy coming that would like to fish why they would put his picture in the paper if he caught a a chub 20 years from now let that go on like that those Nets those traps and everything else and it's practically getting like that right now see what's the matter you've got to think of these that's coming on so when brother Bram was a game warden he saw these people um throwing cast Nets and catching all the fish and they wouldn't keep the fish but the they would just he would allow the fish to just lay there and brother Bram knowing that he loved to fish he said I have to stop that because one of these days my child is going to go up there he's going to want to go fish this place so I have to do something to correct that so that my child will be able to go and fish one of these days so he gave that little example and he goes on to say so we've got to think of the others that are coming behind us these young people and so forth and and a place for our children our daughters we don't want them in the world in these things like that we want them girls to be raised like their mothers now he he says something uh tremendous here he says we've got to make arrangements for that so we've got something to do with it if if we want the CH the daughters to be raised like the mothers the sons to be children of God then us as parents we've got to make arrangements for that and if there is no tomorrow we don't know that but if there is no tomorrow we we haven't nothing um but been at the post the Master's business and been found at our post of Duty when uh when he does come see I would I would suggest this I did Brother Neville let's carry on this just as we have let's let it just stay the way it is I'm grateful for these young ministers see actually at the day of judgment for this entire valleys through through here there'll be no excuse because we've got little churches sitting out everywhere Outpost listing post waiting last night I was at in a Brother's church and asked if all if all in the was fortified behind the word and every hand went up now that made me feel good so so we need to arrange something for our children years ago I heard a brother preach preach a message about time of decision and and he began to talk about how when a child is born we make all the decisions for that baby we we make sure when they want to eat we make sure when they need to be changed and as they grow up we have 100% control of their decisions if they want to go right run in the street well it's your decision go ahead no no we we say no that's dangerous we'll make the decision you're not going over there and and as they grow older maybe they turn seven they begin to make little tiny decisions they want to take a little bit of control of their life so as you're dressing them up to go to school and maybe your little daughter says I don't want to wear those blue shoes I want to wear the pink ones you know what I'm going to allow you to take that decision and you give them a little bit of Reign on their and control on their decisions as they grow up and they grow up and as they get older they begin to make bigger decisions what school are they going to take what job are they going to do what friend group are they going to have they they're going to be begin to make bigger decisions but as the parents we have to make that decision an ultimate decision and then at 18 years old when the let's say the man he's ready to go he's ready to take all of his decisions make all of his decisions and it depends on on how we raise our child on how he's going to make those decisions 18 is a very special age brother bam says when he was beyond the current of time and he saw all the young men and all the young women running towards him he said they were about 18 to 20 years old that is an eternal age because whenever we go to heaven when we go into eternity we go back into that age of 18 so that's an eternal age from 18 to 20 and and brothers that's when the devil will try to attack the young ones they're going to want to make them make wrong decisions it's such an important time in their life brother Bram says Once you turn 21 and you get older and older after 21 that it's harder to come back to the Lord because that young little branch that was Green at one time that was be able to be maneuvered and and and changed now it's it's getting Brown and it's getting steady and its ways to where it's it's harder to turn to the Lord and the older we get the harder we get the harder to go back to the Lord it is the best time to give your heart to the Lord is as a young man and a young woman to give God your youth to receive an experience as a teenager or as a child then God can use you God can grab that little green branch and begin to mold it the way he wants to mold it there there's there's a a way that that people used to mold their trees it was called esing or Esure that that you can get a a uh uh apple tree or orange tree and you can cut it a certain way you can turn the branches a certain way and you can make it a fence you can make shapes with those trees that's what God wants to do with the young people if God can get his hand on a young man on a young woman he will will will shape her in in a such a way that that it'll change families it'll change things around them now we go on and um Satan has a Target on our children all right Satan has always targeted the children we should be very aware of this as parents and look to the shepherd for his help now this next quote on how these last days Satan is using the improper marriages as Major Tool to get the Young people is not this also as it was in the days of Noah it behooves us to open our eyes to see if we are really fortified behind his word are our children fortified behind his word do they know what the word says about these things that is my whole motive and purpose of this book to bring us to the word for the protection of our families brother Bram says in the Third Exodus he says notice the king that new king that raised up that didn't know Joseph that was um that was his first king to destroy the power of Israel what was his first scheme to destroy the power of Israel was with their children is that right he tried to destroy their children now listen close the same Devil in a different form of kingship tried to destroy God's only son see getting rid of the children first before they get a start the devil is um de the Devil is a real smart shrewd bird he knows how to hit the thing before it gets started he knows it see and the only thing you can ever do to beat him is to rely on Christ and humble yourself to let him lead you you'll never do do it any other way your intellectual Powers will never do it you got to believe it and just rely on him he is the shepherd it ain't the Sheep's business to keep the wolf away it's the shepherd's business but the Sheep must stay with the Shepherd in order to stay safe that's my safety zone is in Christ and Christ is the word and that's the safety zone now Brothers I I truly believe that a Christian will make their home a safety zone for their children that's what this place is this place should be a safety zone notice the devil in the form of ramse the king the first thing he done was try try to get rid of the children with the natural death and as soon as the the Son of God was born he moved from Egypt because God destroyed Egypt cursed and it's never come back since then he was in Rome um San moved in his seat to Rome and seat to Rome and at first uh the thing Rome uh did to destroy it all to um the that uh to get to be sure the devil in that Roman system tried to destroy what the Son of God to begin with right the same devil and today he's done the same thing under the sign of the spirit now religious uh professing Christianity and taking our girls and marrying them to Catholic boys and making them bring their children to Catholic to break the power of the other side there's your demon there's your devil Seated on Seven Hills wearing Triple Crowns just as slick and cunning smart intellectual like the serpent the seed of the serpent his children using the same intellectual techniques look what they killed the children in the other two times they they killed the children with what two times now remember watch the two then the three see he killed the children the first two times with natural death and this last time he's getting the children and killing them with a spiritual death marrying and intermarrying the brother says we need to do our best to teach our children and live an example before them so that they will find their place fortified behind the word destruction is all around them let's not be like lot who failed to see the destruction of his children in Sodom I know of too many young people raised in the message homes that are not fortified behind that word and are facing destruction can we not see that standards keep getting lower and God's word is not being taught in our homes the sins and pleasures of this age will destroy our children unless we are like Abraham lift up our eyes and see tomorrow make arrangements for our children as God has warned us brother bam says and by faith Moses he says and if he lets you get to heaven on your Injustice Works he will have to raise up ananas and safaris and give them another opportunity he certainly would but he just ananas saw his money Peter saw Christ lot didn't see the destruction of his children in that place and many of you hold around these old formal Creeds and things you don't see his uh the juvenile delinquency and the destruction of your children you don't see your daughter in a prostitute house you don't see your son a drunkard or in a car table somewhere because she's well watered in sin and is not touched and he didn't see his wife the head of all of the societies turned into a pillar of salt when he was looking he didn't see him escaping only by the edge of his teeth to a city somewhere for his life he didn't see that because he only looked at what what he saw in front of him but Abraham he didn't notice the wellwater land um for he lifted up his eyes and saw the tomorrow he inherit all things amen amen you know another reason that the devil attacks our children is because brother brandham says I'm not going to go to the quote but brother brandham says that that a child that our children they bind our home together that's what a child does for our homes it binds the home and I believe a child or children they're not only the strength of the home but they're the strength of the church that they are the tomorrow Abraham wasn't looking at the well-watered Wells he knew he had to look for tomorrow knowing he had a promised son coming his way and through that promised son all of Israel was going to come out of that child see see we we are holding the the children that we have we're holding people that can possibly change the world just just like uh John Wesley mother Wesley that that woman she had 17 kids and brother BR said she still had two hours of the day to get on her knees and pray to make time for the Lord knowing that that she was going to commit all of those children to the Lord and in that 17 children there was a young little boy named John Wesley Juan Wesley the one of the messengers of the seven Church ages somebody that was going to change and and Change the World by the revelation of the word same thing with Abraham Lincoln ABR Lincoln because of his mother standing on the word creating an atmosphere in her home he was able to be trained up by his mother and changed the world and changed the history of the United States but it started in the home it started with an atmosphere atmosph see see we cannot I cannot feed myself on just Mondays I mean Sundays Wednesdays and Fridays and I know the children they cannot survive off of that they can't just survive off of that word they need that word daily in their home but Brothers It's it's not a chore it's not a duty a Christian is to be Christlike a Christian is to walk in the ways of the Lord gladly he wants to do that it it's it's not something that okay this is what we have to do now I'm an American I act like an American Italians they act like Italians because that's who they are that's where they're from but when you receive the Holy Ghost you act you are you breathe you are Christian so everything Christian I I I am not only responsible but I have have a desire to bring up my children the way I am and to create a safe Zone to create a a holy place a Garden of Eden brother Bram says whether a child or a person uh goes in the wrong way or the right way it all starts in the home I realized that the home is the Garden of Eden because God told Adam and Eve said multiply and replenish the Earth have dominion and they didn't have to go from that place to that place no they stayed there in the throne and governed the whole world in that place and everything that was came from that place and and whatever we are we are the sum of what we were in that home as children that's where it starts I remember when I was around 18 years old I was in a bad shape not because of my parents because of my decisions and I would go out and I would just do horrible things I'd be hanging out with the wrong crowd and whenever I would come back now these people that I hung out with they the way they were raised they were raised to hate cops they were raised to to kill people they were raised to have pride in a certain color they were raised that way they were raised in homes that people would do drugs and and blow smoke in their face and they were only four years old that's their atmosphere that was their safe Zone but me I had a Christian father and a Christian Mother after doing all those bad things with those people that didn't know any better I would go run back to my safe Zone I would go and eat a nice warm dinner I would go and get ready for church what a hypocrite what a hypocrite I was I would go over there and I would I would clean myself up so I didn't smell like the drugs I was taking and my dad told me he said you are worse than your friends and in my mind I didn't I didn't dare to tell him but in my mind I said you don't know the people I'm around these people are ruthless these these people don't care but I when I gave my heart to the Lord when I received the Holy Spirit something came over me and a revelation hit me why my dad told me what he told me why am I worse than those people because they didn't have a choice all they knew was going out and being in gangs all they knew was was to do those bad things a lot of them they didn't have fathers their mothers were out there in the world they didn't have a warm dinner in front of them they didn't have families that prayed for them and me me the prodal the one that had everything I had the Holy Spirit around me every Sunday every service I was in a safe Zone under the token under the Holy Spirit but I chose to go out there and act just like them that's why he said you're worse than them cuz you chose you had a home full of the holy spirit that L the Lord that held to the standard of the word and I made my decision I was old enough to make my decision and I chose the wrong thing and because of that Brothers we live with scars every day God will heal us God will deliver us but brother there's scars of my own doing of things that I have done that could have pre been prevented if I would have stayed in the comfort of the Holy Spirit brothers sisters we create that atmosphere at home whenever whenever the children are there oh what a beautiful thing to to hear a tape of the message to get the children excited about a Bible character and say my favorite is is Solomon well why why is your favorite character Solomon oh because he chose wisdom oh my favorite is this why because we are establishing the word in our homes now I I don't want to well I'm going to ask the question anyways what what have the children been studying in Sunday school can somebody answer me somebody that's not a teacher they've been they've been studying The Book of Proverbs and me as a parent I should know that I'm responsible to know what they're learning in the there because because if the the the teachers they're doing an amazing job but they can't teach them the whole Bible it should be something that the children bring home and and me as a parent ask what did you learn and then continue to teach them on that subject and help them not just for knowledge I don't want them to know no know things Brothers this is a way of life the Book of Proverbs is the way to live the most wise man in the world because of the Lord Jesus or the Lord he he wrote This Book of Proverbs and showed us how to live the life of a Christian now we create that atmosphere now um I I would like to continue to read but but I I just want each and every person that has these Green books to read this to continue to read this because it it tell it tells you through the quotes that we have to keep our children around us brother Bram said there it's not there's not a juvenile delinquency it's a parent delinquency he says in the uh the message that we don't we allow our children to go anywhere they want want but Brothers we have the authority to create the boundaries because every decision that we make for our children comes with great responsibility and and as you give them that responsibility they have to be mature enough to take that responsibility of choice but but Brothers as if you have your children at home whether they're already over 18 years old create an atmosphere brother this message this message is for me when I read this book I'm convicted I say Lord help me to be a better father Lord help me to be a better husband so that I can create an atmosphere around the word let us stand to our feet Heavenly Father Lord I just ask ask that you take these broken up words [Music] father Lord and you just uh place it in each and every heart this evening father father there the words of eternal life and sometimes lord it's hard to hear father especially Lord when it comes from a person as young as I am Lord many men ha have gone through life many of our sisters have gone through it they have the wisdom Lord father but for those that that are are growing our families lord lord for those that are are think thinking to to get married those that are cing or looking for somebody father I ask Lord that you establish this wisdom in our hearts father Lord so that we know where to go that we can say as the righteous man says in Psalms your word word is a lamp unto my feet father and everywhere I go every decision I make is according to your word father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen amen [Applause] amen [Music] amen may the Lord bless our brother [Music] [Laughter] Eli [Music] s oh [Music] lose this ending [Music] Our God to [Music] glor [Music] the GL glor glor
