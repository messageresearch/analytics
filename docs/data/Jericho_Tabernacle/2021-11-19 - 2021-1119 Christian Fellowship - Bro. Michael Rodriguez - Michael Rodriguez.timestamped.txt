[50:33] and nebraska and i'll be giving a
[50:35] missionary report yesterday

[50:41] everything that he's doing in our lives
[50:47] thankful to see you guys one more time
[50:52] for all our brothers that have been sick
[50:54] this past month
[50:58] you know the
[51:00] we're just thankful that you that you're
[51:02] finally healed
[51:06] you know our brother
[51:18] but we know that there's nothing
[51:19] impossible before our
[51:41] and you know it's it's i'm
[51:44] truly thankful for that
[51:47] i've learned that he's not just my
[51:48] pastor but he's also my brother and my
[51:50] friend
[51:54] amigo also i want to thank
[51:56] all the brothers and sisters that
[51:58] dropped off food and all their gifts
[51:59] when our baby was born
[52:06] for all the help with our children
[52:10] i want to thank the santana family for
[52:13] dealing with my two boys
[52:23] so we're going to go i have a little
[52:25] slide
[52:28] we'll go through some pictures vamos a
[52:30] veronas
[52:31] and then also uh after the pictures um i
[52:35] would like to say what we did throughout
[52:37] throughout the
[52:38] trip
[52:43] and just say a few quotes
[52:50] [Music]
[53:08] how many here has a true christian
[53:12] fellowship you know we can't have
[53:14] fellowship without the lord jesus christ
[53:20] you know
[53:21] god
[53:22] created adam
[53:25] to have fellowship
[53:29] and then he created eve because he saw
[53:30] that adam was you know lonely
[53:37] so we were made to have fellowship with
[53:39] the lord jesus christ
[53:44] so um if
[53:47] i want to read
[53:48] the definition of fellowship
[53:54] and it's um a friendly association
[53:58] especially with people who share one's
[54:00] interest
[54:09] um forgive me if i read some of these
[54:11] words incorrect
[54:15] but a cinnamon uh one of the one of them
[54:17] is communion uh synonymous
[54:22] approachment
[54:47] so that that all falls under fellowship
[54:50] today
[54:57] and apply that to our walk with the lord
[54:59] jesus christ
[55:04] to be in good harmony with him
[55:08] to be in good companionship
[55:12] and to become one with him
[55:15] that is the true fellowship
[55:19] um
[55:22] if we could please turn to first john uh
[55:25] chapter one
[55:29] uh while you turn your scriptures i
[55:30] would like to uh greet our brothers from
[55:39] well i want to thank them for their love
[55:41] and the support that we had
[55:44] while we were visiting
[55:46] foreign
[55:49] and for that true christian fellowship
[55:54] also i was told that her brother john
[55:56] anders was watching us
[56:00] may the lord bless you bless your
[56:02] brother
[56:05] and uh we send our love
[56:08] and our support to you guys
[56:12] so
[56:12] first john one
[56:16] and it reads that which was from the
[56:18] beginning which we have heard which we
[56:21] have seen with our eyes which we have
[56:24] looked upon and our hands have
[56:26] handled of the word of life
[56:41] for the life was manifested and we have
[56:43] seen it and bear witness and show on to
[56:46] you
[56:47] that eternal life which was with the
[56:49] father and was what was manifested unto
[56:52] us
[57:03] that which we have seen and heard
[57:06] declare we unto you that ye also may
[57:08] have fellowship with us and truly our
[57:11] fellowship is with the father and with
[57:14] his son
[57:15] jesus christ
[57:28] and these things write we
[57:31] unto you that your joy may be full
[57:35] yes
[57:39] this then is the message where which we
[57:42] have heard of him and declare unto you
[57:44] that god is light and in him is no
[57:47] darkness at all
[57:55] if we say that we have fellowship with
[57:57] him and walk in darkness we lie
[58:01] and do not
[58:02] the truth
[58:10] but if we walk in the light as he is the
[58:13] light we have fellowship one with
[58:15] another and the blood of jesus christ
[58:18] his son cleaneth
[58:20] us from all sin
[58:30] if we say that we have no sin we deceive
[58:32] ourselves and the truth is not in us
[58:41] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[58:44] and just to forgive
[58:47] us our sins
[58:48] and to cleanse us
[58:50] us from all unrighteousness
[58:59] if we say that we have not sinned we
[59:01] make him a liar
[59:03] and his word is not in us
[59:11] and um
[59:12] in this report
[59:13] my focus is but if we walk in the light
[59:16] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[59:20] one with another and the blood of jesus
[59:22] christ his son cleanseth us from sin
[59:26] reported
[59:36] so we could only have a a true christian
[59:39] fellowship
[59:40] if we walk in the light entonces
[59:52] so i
[59:53] i want you guys to just keep that in
[59:55] mind
[59:58] um you know our fellowship with one
[59:59] another
[1:00:03] should reflect our our
[1:00:06] fellowship with the lord jesus christ
[1:00:11] it should be nothing but love
[1:00:15] and we should lay our own lives for our
[1:00:17] brothers and sisters
[1:00:21] so um like i said i uh i'll be going
[1:00:24] over some uh some pictures come on
[1:00:26] mentioned
[1:00:28] um and this is the first slide we'll go
[1:00:31] to the next one
[1:00:34] this is just a picture to show you where
[1:00:36] nebraska is
[1:00:39] nebraska and if you can see we're about
[1:00:42] uh two states uh up and one to the right
[1:00:50] um
[1:00:51] it is a very beautiful state
[1:00:54] and and
[1:00:56] didn't realize that it's in the middle
[1:00:57] of the country
[1:01:01] that just that makes me think and it's
[1:01:03] red
[1:01:06] and on the middle the heart is usually
[1:01:08] in the middle
[1:01:28] and that's where we landed
[1:01:31] and north focus right above it
[1:01:35] and it's about a two hour drive yes

[1:01:59] cut through colorado kansas
[1:02:03] and making our way up to norfolk
[1:02:07] and as you can see it's about 20 hours
[1:02:13] forgive me for the mileage but i think
[1:02:14] it's more like 1200 miles

[1:11:36] album
[1:11:39] and to see you know the the the pull
[1:11:43] of questions
[1:11:46] you know there was a lot of questions
[1:11:49] and praise god that brother eli went

[1:12:01] uh so this is a uh brother uh miguelito
[1:12:05] este elemento miguelito
[1:12:11] um and
[1:12:13] you know it's is
[1:12:14] there there was an attraction from day
[1:12:17] one
[1:12:20] just his personality
[1:12:23] is is he's he's strong strong strong
[1:12:26] character is a character
[1:12:29] which reminds me a lot of my dad
[1:12:32] and and he he likes to uh he works in

[1:12:39] and and he
[1:12:40] he has a business of laying
[1:12:42] the foundation
[1:12:47] and i think it's wonderful because you
[1:12:48] know being a pastor you have to lay the
[1:12:50] foundation in your own church
[1:12:56] i put the foundation in somebody's life
[1:13:00] and i think it's just wonderful that he
[1:13:01] does that for a living as well
[1:13:12] um he gave me uh he gave me one of those
[1:13:15] hats
[1:13:18] and i have it here just to show you
[1:13:20] aquila
[1:13:21] you know i never did show and tell in
[1:13:23] school
[1:13:28] today
[1:13:29] um as you can see the the business name
[1:13:32] is cornerstone concrete
[1:13:39] uh the moment i seen it it it was an
[1:13:41] attraction to me there's a moment
[1:13:55] you know and i think it's it's
[1:13:57] you know it's beautiful
[1:14:00] and hopefully i could take this idea
[1:14:02] from him
[1:14:04] i have another hat
[1:14:07] this is his brother uh megan little's
[1:14:09] son brother michael gave this to me
[1:14:11] elijah
[1:14:14] and
[1:14:16] it says nebraska
[1:14:18] sister lisa maybe you could help me
[1:14:20] still

[1:14:22] uh so it's
[1:14:24] s-t-e-e-l-e
[1:14:26] steel
[1:14:31] um so he he also gave us a hat
[1:14:36] in nebraska
[1:14:38] and and um he brother eli was blessed
[1:14:40] also with two hats
[1:14:44] and i
[1:14:46] you know these are just hats yes
[1:14:49] but when somebody gives you something
[1:14:50] with love
[1:14:53] and with what the true heart
[1:14:58] it means it means a lot significant
[1:15:01] and and this means a lot to me
[1:15:05] so uh you go to the next picture
[1:15:08] uh here we are sister sarah brother
[1:15:11] miguelito and myself
[1:15:15] this picture was taken uh uh on the way
[1:15:17] back already at the airport esta photo
[1:15:23] if you tomato to the next slide
[1:15:26] this is brother eli his uncle and his
[1:15:28] and his auntie style man
[1:15:32] and
[1:15:33] just just a wonderful couple yeah
[1:15:37] you know when somebody can
[1:15:38] live your life by their testimony
[1:15:44] they don't have to explain to you what
[1:15:46] it is to walk in the light
[1:15:50] you
[1:15:59] uh this is uh i took this picture uh on
[1:16:03] the way back
[1:16:06] i thought it was a beautiful picture and
[1:16:08] i just wanted to share with you um
[1:16:12] you know um
[1:16:16] sometimes when we when we leave the lord
[1:16:18] jesus christ
[1:16:23] he looks
[1:16:24] far further and further every time
[1:16:29] and and we think he's very far
[1:16:32] established and with this picture it
[1:16:35] means you think that sometimes it's it's
[1:16:37] it's hard to come back
[1:16:42] but the lord jesus brother branham says
[1:16:44] that the lord jesus christ is closer
[1:16:46] than your right arm
[1:16:50] but um yeah so i just wanted to share
[1:16:52] that picture because i i thought it was
[1:16:53] a beautiful
[1:16:54] pic
[1:16:56] site
[1:17:01] um so we left last friday
[1:17:06] i just wanted to explain where everybody
[1:17:08] was curious
[1:17:11] and um we left last friday my brother
[1:17:13] peter dropped us off around three in the
[1:17:15] morning
[1:17:20] our flight was at 6am
[1:17:25] we landed in dallas texas about two
[1:17:27] hours later about nine
[1:17:40] before we got to omaha's sister uh our
[1:17:42] sister sarah anthony omaha
[1:17:46] was was so in contact with it
[1:17:50] and and she was calling us because it's
[1:17:52] it's already november and it's cold out
[1:17:54] there
[1:18:03] but then she also said that there was
[1:18:05] very strong winds
[1:18:09] about like 30 or 40 miles uh gushes of
[1:18:12] wind
[1:18:16] and you know what uh
[1:18:18] i i got happy
[1:18:19] yo
[1:18:21] that sounds crazy right
[1:18:24] but i got happy because brother branham
[1:18:25] says
[1:18:29] that when the storm comes
[1:18:32] the ego gets happy
[1:18:34] the ego
[1:18:35] lifts up his wings
[1:18:39] and it goes right through the storm
[1:18:42] and he says that his left wing is the
[1:18:44] old testament
[1:18:47] and his right wing is the new testament
[1:18:51] so i got happy to hear there was wind
[1:18:54] greg
[1:18:56] and i didn't even know why
[1:18:58] so i i think that's
[1:19:00] that's a god with us
[1:19:03] you know brother brown talks so
[1:19:04] wonderful about the the eagles
[1:19:29] we really got to know each other with uh
[1:19:31] with fellowship
[1:19:49] from there we took off and we drove two
[1:19:52] hours to to uh
[1:19:55] to norfolk
[1:19:59] north folk where we continue to have
[1:20:01] fellowship at their house
[1:20:13] and and i think that's that's when god
[1:20:14] comes in the scene yo crocodile
[1:20:18] and i see that i i say this because
[1:20:21] you know it's it's the simple things
[1:20:25] you know when we open the door for
[1:20:26] somebody
[1:20:29] it feels the person feels very good
[1:20:33] so i think those little details is what
[1:20:36] we should be working on
[1:20:41] friday night uh their their son came
[1:20:43] over with his kids
[1:20:57] and he invited us to his house and he
[1:20:58] wanted us to stay there
[1:21:04] so we went over had fellowship had late
[1:21:06] dinner
[1:21:10] and it was such a wonderful time
[1:21:14] they're they're little ones that got a
[1:21:15] little sick
[1:21:19] and the only thing i could think of is
[1:21:21] and brother eli and i were in our
[1:21:22] children
[1:21:25] foreign
[1:21:28] and it was wonderful to see uh say
[1:21:31] sister sage you know jump into action as
[1:21:33] a mom
[1:21:38] i think we should honor our moms more
[1:21:41] often
[1:21:44] saturday we we woke up a little late
[1:21:49] we were up for almost 24 hours
[1:21:54] and so we we head over there to uh to
[1:21:57] our the pastor's house
[1:22:01] and we're we got lost in fellowship and
[1:22:03] uh next thing it was like four o'clock
[1:22:22] because those sisters that are here that
[1:22:24] know what it takes to prepare food
[1:22:29] to take your time out of the day
[1:22:33] to work hard
[1:22:35] to put money out of your pockets
[1:22:48] i greatly appreciate all his efforts
[1:22:53] that evening we we went he's building a
[1:22:56] business a restaurant
[1:23:02] and and he wanted brother eli and his
[1:23:04] uncle to pray over the building
[1:23:09] and i think it's a wonderful thing
[1:23:13] if we put god first
[1:23:16] above all things
[1:23:18] you know god is going to be with us
[1:23:21] and no matter what it is at work
[1:23:25] our business
[1:23:27] our co-workers
[1:23:29] of all things you put god first
[1:23:33] and and we should see all the blessings
[1:23:39] we we went back
[1:23:40] at this this his restaurant is about 60
[1:23:43] miles out out of the town
[1:23:54] [Music]
[1:23:59] so sunday morning brother elina we get
[1:24:01] up a little early
[1:24:06] um our beautiful brother asked brother
[1:24:09] like to preach
[1:24:13] and he told us that the doors open at 9
[1:24:15] 30.
[1:24:18] i thought it was nice to say 9 30 not
[1:24:20] 10.
[1:24:24] you know and we were all there on time
[1:24:27] um and
[1:24:29] you know i'm sharing the report with you
[1:24:30] guys
[1:24:34] but it was nice to to to show up at
[1:24:36] church
[1:24:38] and and to see the sisters in meditation
[1:24:56] truly expecting of the lord jesus christ
[1:25:01] we had their church is one of one of
[1:25:03] their houses
[1:25:07] and it was a very wonderful time
[1:25:10] um the worship was
[1:25:14] beautiful it was it was wonderful
[1:25:15] worship
[1:25:19] you know um
[1:25:21] we sang acapella
[1:25:24] and there's just something about seeing
[1:25:26] in a cappella
[1:25:29] you know it truly brings down uh
[1:25:32] the the holy spirit
[1:25:37] um so our brother eli uh preached about
[1:25:42] uh on exodus
[1:25:47] 20 1920.
[1:25:50] and his his title was fear
[1:25:54] and and he talked about that there's two
[1:25:56] fears
[1:25:59] classes
[1:26:00] and and he brought it so wonderful
[1:26:06] where she was
[1:26:14] the pastor asked me to say a few words
[1:26:19] and if you know me i was
[1:26:21] down by a couple minutes
[1:26:28] um
[1:26:29] there was um
[1:26:31] brother eli's message was was very very
[1:26:33] powerful
[1:26:36] and and
[1:26:37] you know they needed to hear it
[1:26:41] and i needed to hear it
[1:26:44] because there we know that there's fear
[1:26:48] but there's no fear in god
[1:26:51] so but there but we can have fear
[1:26:55] but fear of god
[1:26:58] so if that sounds a little confusing
[1:27:02] talk to brother
[1:27:17] and we got to see how he's building
[1:27:20] everything
[1:27:23] the basement and everything
[1:27:25] and it was it was very wonderful
[1:27:29] you know as a man you know you like to
[1:27:31] see construction and shovels and
[1:27:34] and you know bulldozers or the tractors
[1:27:37] that he had come um
[1:27:44] and i really enjoyed it
[1:27:47] and i thank them for for taking melter
[1:27:51] we continue our fellowship at their
[1:27:53] house
[1:27:57] uh we we ate
[1:27:59] and then uh
[1:28:01] we had
[1:28:02] you know when you're having fellowship
[1:28:03] at home
[1:28:05] companies
[1:28:06] and you start testifying of the lord
[1:28:10] and next do you know somebody's being
[1:28:11] blessed uh
[1:28:26] and then the pastor would always come in
[1:28:28] and quote scriptures
[1:28:34] that late evening uh we went back to
[1:28:36] brother michael's house
[1:28:41] and
[1:28:42] we had a wonderful time
[1:28:45] and
[1:28:47] sage sister sage had a lot of questions
[1:28:53] she belongs to the lutheran church
[1:28:58] and and it was wonderful to to hear her
[1:29:04] um
[1:29:05] i'll i'll be honest with you
[1:29:08] and i told her yeah you know she knows
[1:29:11] more scriptures by heart
[1:29:15] that i could ever learn
[1:29:20] so we had a very good time
[1:29:35] uh monday morning
[1:29:38] we had
[1:29:39] breakfast over at the pastor's house
[1:29:44] sister made
[1:29:45] fresh flower tortillas
[1:29:49] frescas
[1:29:51] and and that just you know made me
[1:29:52] thought of my wife
[1:29:57] of my mom my grandma me my mom
[1:30:01] you know just
[1:30:02] it's just such a
[1:30:04] bless blessing time
[1:30:07] you know time to reflect on your parents
[1:30:13] and all those hard efforts
[1:30:17] after after having breakfast they they
[1:30:19] drove us back to
[1:30:21] to uh to
[1:30:24] omaha
[1:30:29] omaha and it was a two-hour drive
[1:30:32] and they took us out to eat to crack a
[1:30:34] barrel
[1:30:35] come out a cracker barrel and uh they
[1:30:37] dropped those off
[1:30:40] um i'm very thankful for for all their
[1:30:42] other efforts
[1:30:48] to drive two hours to pick us up and
[1:30:50] drive and drive us back
[1:30:53] today
[1:30:57] that is true true christian fellowship
[1:31:01] when you're willing to put your your
[1:31:04] life aside
[1:31:07] to bless somebody else
[1:31:11] so um
[1:31:13] that's that's what we did
[1:31:17] and i have a few quotes
[1:31:22] and uh this quote you can find it in a
[1:31:24] way to have fellowship yes
[1:31:31] um
[1:31:33] i'm not going to read the whole thing
[1:31:37] because i think some of your fans sleep
[1:31:42] my brother peter's over there falling
[1:31:43] asleep
[1:31:46] i just i just want to make you laugh a
[1:31:48] little bit
[1:31:50] um so is paragraph 18
[1:31:54] i'd rather have a church
[1:32:06] i would rather have a church that knows
[1:32:09] nothing about any spiritual gift
[1:32:16] and just be so in love with each other
[1:32:18] and with christ
[1:32:23] i'd rather have that than every spirit
[1:32:25] gift
[1:32:26] operating in the church
[1:32:31] now that might sound hard in a
[1:32:33] pentecostal group
[1:32:37] but i would rather have it
[1:32:40] where there is gifts there
[1:32:43] they fail
[1:32:46] where there is gifts they will bring
[1:32:48] confusion
[1:32:51] where there is gifts they can be
[1:33:03] and if you had a perfect love you'll
[1:33:05] have perfect gifts
[1:33:18] and fellowship brings gifts
[1:33:33] it says i would rather have a church
[1:33:35] that knows nothing about spiritual gifts
[1:33:41] and just be so in love with each other
[1:33:44] and with christ
[1:33:49] i asked myself do we love
[1:33:51] each other tonight
[1:33:55] do we really really love each other
[1:33:58] if i was to offend you this evening
[1:34:02] will you be willing to love me anyways
[1:34:07] if you see if you see the deacon that
[1:34:10] kind of scolds you
[1:34:13] because you were wrong
[1:34:15] are you willing to accept it
[1:34:19] and are you willing to love him
[1:34:22] you know
[1:34:23] if you don't have that fellowship with
[1:34:25] christ
[1:34:28] there's no way that you're going to have
[1:34:29] fellowship with your brother
[1:34:41] and true love comes from the lord jesus
[1:34:43] christ
[1:35:12] is because he was made that way
[1:35:17] he was made to have fellowship
[1:35:20] what what fellowship is i got four days
[1:35:23] driving to do starting tomorrow
[1:35:39] and i had to drive it by myself in a
[1:35:42] little old truck
[1:35:47] and someone a friend of mine is coming
[1:35:49] down
[1:35:53] i just left word this afternoon
[1:35:58] to ride all the way out there with me
[1:36:01] and ride back by myself on a greyhound
[1:36:03] bus
[1:36:21] his little swiss heart
[1:36:51] and then have to ride all the way back
[1:36:53] up to
[1:36:54] uh
[1:37:00] wisconsin on a bus or some or somehow
[1:37:03] just to get back or
[1:37:14] to have fellowship with his children
[1:37:34] you know it's it's beautiful when
[1:37:35] somebody wants to go with you to have
[1:37:36] fellowship yes
[1:37:40] you know even even as an assistant
[1:37:44] to brothers
[1:37:46] it was wonderful to be with him
[1:37:50] to be able to experience that fellowship
[1:37:52] with him
[1:37:56] here we have this brother that went two
[1:37:58] thousand five hundred miles with brother
[1:38:00] branham
[1:38:12] that fellowship brings healing
[1:38:31] maybe we're too busy with our phones
[1:38:34] or our tv shows more important than to
[1:38:36] go whether pastor
[1:38:38] to to some town or
[1:38:40] television is
[1:38:44] i think it's amazing that this brother
[1:38:46] wanted
[1:38:47] to cr to go cross-country
[1:38:53] just to have fellowship
[1:38:56] if you could turn your scriptures to
[1:38:57] john three first first john three siebre
[1:39:00] primera de juan capitolo
[1:39:08] uh
[1:39:08] verse eleven el brasicolons
[1:39:12] for this is the message that ye heard
[1:39:14] from the beginning that we should love
[1:39:16] one another
[1:39:24] who was of that wicked one and slew his
[1:39:27] brother and whosoever slew him
[1:39:30] because his own works were evil and his
[1:39:32] brothers righteous
[1:39:52] we know that we have passed from death
[1:39:54] onto life
[1:39:58] because we love the brethren
[1:40:02] he that loveth not his brother abides in
[1:40:05] death
[1:40:09] his brother is a murderer and ye know
[1:40:12] that no murder has eternal life abiding
[1:40:15] in him todd
[1:40:23] hereby perceive
[1:40:24] with
[1:40:25] the love of god
[1:40:28] because he laid down his life for us and
[1:40:30] we outed to lay down our lives for the
[1:40:34] brethren
[1:40:46] good and see it his brother have need
[1:40:48] and shutted up his balls of
[1:40:51] compassion from him
[1:40:53] how dweller the love of god in him
[1:40:57] is
[1:41:04] my little children let us not love and
[1:41:07] word
[1:41:08] neither in tongue but in deed and in
[1:41:11] truth
[1:41:17] so i think we we should
[1:41:19] don't tell somebody that you love him
[1:41:25] but show him that you love him
[1:41:28] we need to put ourselves in action
[1:41:32] and start loving our brothers and
[1:41:34] sisters
[1:41:37] because
[1:41:38] you know it says on the verse 14 we know
[1:41:41] that we have passed from death unto life
[1:41:43] because we love the brethren he that
[1:41:45] loveth not his brother abides in him in
[1:41:48] death
[1:41:58] and it says that we should lay down our
[1:41:59] own lives for our brothers
[1:42:06] how many times are we willing to put our
[1:42:08] lives down for somebody else
[1:42:11] is
[1:42:14] how many times are we willing to share a
[1:42:15] testimony to bring life to somebody else
[1:42:23] you know sometimes there could be
[1:42:24] problems
[1:42:38] instead of stepping all over him
[1:42:40] you know how many times do we just step
[1:42:42] all over our brothers
[1:42:46] and not have that christian fellowship
[1:42:49] cristiano how many times we can't
[1:42:50] forgive our brothers
[1:42:54] we can't forgive
[1:43:22] of that true christian fellowship
[1:43:26] every action that we take
[1:43:29] it has to reflect the lord jesus christ
[1:43:32] i would like to share a little testimony
[1:43:35] testimony of my niece
[1:43:38] and i say this so we can learn not to do
[1:43:40] the same mistake
[1:43:46] you know uh my niece came down to visit
[1:43:48] us
[1:43:51] she's about 18 years old
[1:43:53] and the day that she was going to fly
[1:43:55] back
[1:43:58] she was folding her clothes
[1:44:01] and so
[1:44:02] you know
[1:44:03] i got down and sat down on the floor
[1:44:05] with her what is your favorite piece
[1:44:07] you know we got to get to that level of
[1:44:10] of the youth and the children
[1:44:14] and i was helping her fold her clothes
[1:44:18] and she pulled out a mini skirt
[1:44:21] and and i said oh you have a skirt
[1:44:27] but i'm never going to wear it again
[1:44:30] you know on on the way down to phoenix
[1:44:32] you say in camino
[1:44:34] we stopped at one of those churches that
[1:44:35] you guys go to um
[1:44:42] and i was judged
[1:44:44] they looked at me up and
[1:44:46] down they made me feel like the worst
[1:44:49] person
[1:44:52] you know
[1:44:53] that hurts yes
[1:44:56] especially coming from a message church
[1:44:57] especially
[1:45:12] but my niece told me that from from that
[1:45:15] day forward
[1:45:18] she will never wear a skirt again
[1:45:21] and she says that there were a bunch of
[1:45:22] hypocrites
[1:45:25] and just because they had long skirts
[1:45:27] and long hair
[1:45:36] you know a lot of the times we could be
[1:45:38] that stumbling rock
[1:45:42] so let's let's get into that fellowship
[1:45:45] with the lord jesus christ
[1:45:49] let's not judge our fallen brothers
[1:45:54] and somebody wants to walk through that
[1:45:55] door right now
[1:45:56] uh
[1:46:10] are we going to judge
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:26] why should we feel better or greater
[1:46:28] than somebody else
[1:46:32] i i think we should we should have a
[1:46:33] true fellowship with the lord jesus
[1:46:35] christ
[1:46:42] i have a few
[1:46:46] i have a few quotes but um i want to
[1:46:48] share a testimony that you know a lot of
[1:46:50] you we i've shared it so many times
[1:46:59] and that was the fellowship before my
[1:47:01] conversion yes
[1:47:05] and and that was with my wife
[1:47:08] you know i wasn't in that fellowship
[1:47:10] with the lord jesus christ
[1:47:15] and our relationship our fellowship
[1:47:18] would never work
[1:47:22] because i wasn't right with the lord
[1:47:23] jesus christ
[1:47:27] and and when we're not right we're we're
[1:47:28] not in fellowship with the lord or with
[1:47:30] in communion with the lord
[1:47:45] and not having a right the right
[1:47:48] attitude towards anything
[1:47:52] but when that fellowship came
[1:47:54] to companies when i accepted the lord
[1:47:56] jesus christ as my savior
[1:48:00] and he started cleansing me through the
[1:48:01] word
[1:48:12] i was sorry for everything that i did
[1:48:16] and i want to live my own life for her
[1:48:19] because i knew i didn't deserve it
[1:48:22] so that's the difference i have in a
[1:48:24] fellowship with the lord jesus christ
[1:48:30] i'm going to read the last quote
[1:48:34] and it's the longest one
[1:48:36] so i hope you enjoy it
[1:48:39] it's from the queen of sheba del mensage
[1:48:43] and after this i'll i'll be finishing
[1:48:47] and if the musicians will come up
[1:48:50] in a couple minutes
[1:48:54] greatly appreciate it
[1:48:56] uh got two little girls
[1:48:58] setting uh sitting back there rebecca
[1:49:01] and sarah
[1:49:04] there are both daddy's little girls
[1:49:09] when i go out
[1:49:12] why
[1:49:13] i'm or they're always waiting for me to
[1:49:16] come back
[1:49:20] they love daddy
[1:49:22] and you know how daddy loves them
[1:49:26] there's a little parable
[1:49:29] one more one morning that i'd come in
[1:49:32] early
[1:49:34] and the kitties had waited long
[1:49:39] and i was late so they had to
[1:50:08] and i and i was so worn out yesterday
[1:50:11] i just couldn't sleep
[1:50:14] and i got up early
[1:50:17] sitting in the chair
[1:50:20] after a while i heard a scramble in the
[1:50:22] children's bedroom
[1:50:27] becky had woke up and she wondered where
[1:50:30] daddy
[1:50:31] is
[1:50:34] if he got in
[1:50:36] here she comes through the house just as
[1:50:38] hard
[1:50:39] as she can
[1:50:44] behind her come her little sister about
[1:50:46] so tall
[1:50:50] now becky was was big
[1:50:53] and she was about 13.
[1:50:58] and skinny
[1:51:00] sir was a little chunky fella
[1:51:04] her pajamas feet her pajamas feet about
[1:51:07] twice the size they ought to be
[1:51:16] she was a falling she was a falling over
[1:51:19] most everything in the house
[1:51:24] and becky come and jumped right at a
[1:51:26] straddle of my leg
[1:51:28] becky is uh
[1:51:31] and her big long legs hung down to the
[1:51:34] floor
[1:51:38] she could balance yourself pretty well
[1:51:41] i think about like the churches
[1:51:44] sometimes
[1:52:00] that's all right
[1:52:02] we appreciate that
[1:52:04] and she put her arms around me to hug me
[1:52:06] real tight
[1:52:10] and she said my daddy
[1:52:12] papa and when she heard sarah
[1:52:16] quesada her little sister coming
[1:52:19] she turned and looked at sora
[1:52:22] and she said sarah
[1:52:25] sarah reminded me of this little church
[1:52:29] that just started
[1:52:34] you know it's it isn't very old
[1:52:40] antigua sometimes it gets up in the air
[1:53:04] and there is nothing left for you
[1:53:08] little sarah dropped her little lips
[1:53:10] down
[1:53:38] is
[1:53:45] you know they get a little upside topsy
[1:53:48] turvy sometimes
[1:53:58] they just but as long as they're there
[1:54:01] so i just took both arms
[1:54:19] and i hugged her up close to me
[1:54:23] and she rolled that little head around
[1:54:27] them little black guys
[1:54:31] stuck out and looked at becky
[1:54:40] i want to tell you something
[1:54:44] said
[1:54:46] it
[1:54:46] it may be true that you got
[1:55:12] i don't know all the ins and outs maybe
[1:55:15] of the bible no no
[1:55:33] that's all i care for is
[1:55:35] if i'm so completely surrendered to him
[1:55:38] and to his will
[1:55:43] that he can work his his works
[1:55:47] let the world say what they want
[1:55:53] you know
[1:55:54] sometimes we feel that we're holding on
[1:55:55] to the lord jesus christ
[1:56:03] um you know a lot of times we're barely
[1:56:06] holding on
[1:56:10] maybe we're not ready to forgive our
[1:56:12] brothers he says
[1:56:23] sometimes we can't even forgive our
[1:56:25] children
[1:56:48] but i think it's time for god to hold on
[1:56:50] to us
[1:56:53] i think it's time for him to have a full
[1:56:55] fellowship with us
[1:57:00] just as adam had with him at the garden
[1:57:05] i want to have that fellowship
[1:57:08] i have those same struggles that you do
[1:57:12] i'm fighting the same fight that you are
[1:57:14] este
[1:57:16] and our brothers in nebraska are
[1:57:17] fighting the same fight
[1:57:21] same struggles
[1:57:26] why not go to the lord jesus christ
[1:57:29] why not let everything out
[1:57:33] surrender our arms
[1:57:36] even if we're not balanced right
[1:57:40] and let him take control of her lives
[1:57:44] i don't know about you but that's what i
[1:57:45] want in my life
[1:57:48] i'm far from perfect
[1:57:58] so praise god for that gloria
[1:58:02] you know i i
[1:58:03] there's fear sometimes this is item
[1:58:07] and it's hard to overcome yes difficult
[1:58:10] and i want to thank my tokyo brother
[1:58:11] miguelito
[1:58:15] because he says something over there
[1:58:19] there's a brother named john out there
[1:58:22] [Music]

[1:58:27] he's saying a special el canton special
[1:58:30] and it was a cappella
[1:58:32] and the pastor said if you want to sing
[1:58:34] a special don't have fear and sing it
[1:58:36] [Music]
[1:58:40] i would like for you to sing with me
[1:58:43] and i want to show the devil that i am
[1:58:44] not afraid of him
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:59:02] i think it's time to have that
[1:59:02] fellowship with the lord and cast out
[1:59:04] that fear
[1:59:08] to be like jesus
[1:59:11] jesus and if you could all please stand
