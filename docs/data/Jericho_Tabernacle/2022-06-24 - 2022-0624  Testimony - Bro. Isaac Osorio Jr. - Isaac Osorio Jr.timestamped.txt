[45:35] all right i just would like to say
[45:38] thank you for your prayers
[45:41] and
[45:43] it was something
[45:45] in my life
[45:47] that i
[45:48] never
[45:49] in a million years would have thought it
[45:50] would happen to me
[45:55] it was something that it was just just
[45:58] far that i never thought it would happen
[45:59] to me
[46:04] so um to start off
[46:07] i just want to say uh some of the things
[46:09] that was happened to me before i found
[46:11] out
[46:23] and this was
[46:24] the end of last year beginning of this
[46:26] year
[46:39] i just couldn't finish my food
[46:42] and it i
[46:44] i just
[46:46] i
[46:46] i would eat this the portion of the size
[46:49] portion that i would eat
[46:53] is that i would order a happy meal
[46:56] happy meal and i would get full from
[46:58] that
[46:59] and that's and usually i would eat
[47:02] five times more than that
[47:09] and i because of that i lost a lot of
[47:11] weight
[47:14] probably
[47:16] 30 to 40 plus pounds
[47:21] and
[47:23] the other thing that i started to notice
[47:27] is that i would get
[47:29] it um
[47:30] i would get itchy a lot esca
[47:32] especially here in my legs
[47:35] um i just um would
[47:40] i would just constantly scratch the itch
[47:44] and it wouldn't the itch wouldn't stop
[47:48] and i would scratch it so much
[48:01] it was so itchy to the point where her
[48:03] tanta comes
[48:10] and i would just you know in the middle
[48:12] of night we'll just use it to just
[48:13] scratch the itch
[48:18] and
[48:19] all these things would happen to me
[48:23] and i thought that it was i i would just
[48:25] use common sense
[48:29] i would you know take hot showers
[48:43] it will make my skin dry and then put
[48:44] lotion
[48:46] is
[48:54] and then i will notice that i would have
[48:55] this this cough
[48:59] it wouldn't it would happen
[49:01] it will come back it will
[49:02] come and go era
[49:05] and every time i would cough
[49:08] um i would either throw up or vomit or i
[49:11] would just spit out phlegm
[49:14] and
[49:31] i probably stepped on the floor with no
[49:33] socks like my mom told me not to kisa
[49:40] and maybe just that i have phlegm it is
[49:46] and i would never
[49:49] either feel pain never feel pain
[49:53] i would have never uh thought what would
[49:56] have would come happened
[50:00] and
[50:02] um

[56:17] right
[56:20] and she said um
[56:21] [Music]
[56:23] what'd you do to make you faint
[56:43] yeah if you can see and she said well
[56:45] uh usually if you take too long
[56:49] your blood pressure goes down this
[56:52] is very common
[56:55] that people would feign in while taking
[56:57] a hot shower
[57:02] i i never knew that
[57:04] i you know i always i during the winter
[57:07] time i always take hot showers
[57:24] but i did see that your heart's a bit
[57:26] anemic
[57:29] it's a little too fast
[57:32] and um
[57:34] before i went to the hospital
[57:36] hospital
[57:38] i would notice
[57:40] that my my watch
[57:43] would tell me medicine that my heart
[57:45] beat would be too too fast and normal
[57:51] and it says oh i've you've been inactive
[57:53] for 10 minutes
[57:57] please get up and do something
[58:01] so i just yeah you know i didn't think
[58:03] much of it as well
[58:06] so then
[58:20] and they put
[58:26] and then they um
[58:28] they they scheduled me to for an mri
[58:31] scan
[58:32] program
[58:45] there's no infections or anything like
[58:47] that no espresso
[58:58] around four in the morning
[59:01] and
[59:02] then they scanned me and they put me
[59:05] back in my room where my mom was me
[59:10] and
[59:10] my dad was was waiting in the parking
[59:12] lot in the car
[59:16] because we just thought it would just be
[59:18] a quick thing
[59:22] you know they can say oh you have some
[59:25] infection in your lungs
[59:30] here's some steroids and you could go
[59:32] home
[59:36] and you know i think that's that i was
[59:38] that's all i thought yeah
[59:42] yeah that was going to happen okay
[59:44] you know i was i was ready to go to work
[59:47] the next day and everything
[59:51] and then here comes the doctor
[59:55] and with a group of nurse nurses
[1:00:11] so then here comes the doctor and her
[1:00:12] squad
[1:00:16] what's going on
[1:00:18] that's what i thought i didn't tell her
[1:00:22] and then she she came to me with a very
[1:00:25] worrying face uh
[1:00:31] everybody had a face mask but i could
[1:00:33] see it in her eyes that she was very
[1:00:34] worried
[1:00:39] so then um she told she told me and
[1:00:41] don't say yeah
[1:00:43] oh we we we checked your your
[1:00:45] mri scan
[1:00:49] and um
[1:00:50] we we have some bad news
[1:00:54] we found a
[1:00:56] a big mass in contra
[1:00:59] that is between your lung and heart
[1:01:05] it's very
[1:01:06] very big it's grande and we you have
[1:01:10] tiny
[1:01:11] tiny masses around your chest
[1:01:17] and you have liquid under your heart
[1:01:22] that is pressure in your heart
[1:01:25] that would you know
[1:01:27] would pressure it so that's why my heart
[1:01:29] kept beating so fast
[1:01:34] and then she and then she says the next
[1:01:36] words that i'll never forget
[1:01:41] and it might be cancerous
[1:01:45] no one wants to hear that c word
[1:01:49] and right there as as a
[1:02:18] like you know that feeling it's very
[1:02:20] hard to explain but you know that
[1:02:21] feeling like oh my mom's going to kill
[1:02:22] me
[1:02:27] i felt that feeling
[1:02:29] i don't know
[1:02:30] no my mom if you know me mama
[1:02:44] this is going to be a very long journey
[1:02:55] right away i kind of

[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:09] [Music]
[1:03:28] her hand
[1:03:30] and said it's okay mom
[1:03:33] everything's going to be okay
[1:03:35] you know the the doctors could say what
[1:03:37] they want to say
[1:03:40] the doctors could find whatever they
[1:03:41] find
[1:03:52] and then you know
[1:03:54] you know um she would still cry

[1:14:35] they would put scriptures for me um
[1:14:39] and right there that just that that that
[1:14:41] broke me yes
[1:14:43] and that and i i just you know started
[1:14:46] you know tears started falling down down
[1:14:47] my face
[1:14:50] where i just realized
[1:14:53] where you know how many
[1:14:56] people how much they love me truly
[1:15:02] i never felt so much love
[1:15:06] you know i always i've always been loved
[1:15:10] but so much
[1:15:12] it was
[1:15:13] it was something beautiful
[1:15:16] and from there you know little things
[1:15:17] started making me cry
[1:15:22] oh
[1:15:30] and i would hear the oh this church also
[1:15:32] was it's also praying for you
[1:15:36] and then i
[1:15:38] and
[1:15:40] um
[1:15:42] a week or a week and a half passed by
[1:15:47] media and they still
[1:15:49] you know wouldn't
[1:15:51] they wouldn't say what it was
[1:15:55] and the doctor came
[1:15:59] with your squad
[1:16:01] and she you know came up to me
[1:16:14] um you know to it's very similar to
[1:16:17] others yes
[1:16:28] because before they took out pieces of
[1:16:30] the the ones i had around my chest
[1:16:47] you know or we could just get some of
[1:16:49] the small ones you have here
[1:16:54] and she's you know she got a little
[1:16:56] confused
[1:16:58] she was still feeling me
[1:17:22] and then she would try to find what was
[1:17:24] you know the little little um tumors
[1:17:28] tomorrow
[1:17:38] [Music]
[1:17:41] i already know that the prayers were
[1:17:42] working yes
[1:17:48] it's probably the steroids that i gave
[1:17:50] you
[1:17:53] you know it probably shrunk um
[1:18:02] and um
[1:18:05] during those days uh
[1:18:08] a nurse came up to me
[1:18:22] i just came here because i fainted in
[1:18:24] the shower
[1:18:35] [Music]
[1:18:37] the universe wanted you to be
[1:18:45] so then they went uh they put me in um
[1:18:49] for the second biopsy it was
[1:18:53] and this time
[1:18:57] i did feel the needle
[1:19:02] but after
[1:19:04] they put it in this was
[1:19:19] so then they finally took a bunch of
[1:19:22] chunks out of the big one
[1:19:28] just to give you an idea how big it was
[1:19:33] it was like
[1:19:34] they said 13 centimeters
[1:19:39] like all around here
[1:19:43] and so then they start studying the
[1:19:44] little pieces that they took out
[1:20:01] if they find anything anyways
[1:20:05] so then um yeah they
[1:20:07] diagnosed me with
[1:20:09] classical hodgkin's lymphoma
[1:20:12] diagnosis
[1:20:15] classical and the the doctor
[1:20:19] doctor um came to me
[1:20:21] you know said all this
[1:20:23] and she said that um
[1:20:26] that they're gonna start planning my my
[1:20:28] chemotherapies now
[1:20:44] the chemotherapy

[1:20:48] the thing that makes you lose your hair
[1:20:50] huh

[1:21:15] you know she tried to make a little sad
[1:21:17] thing but i said i'm like oh ok
[1:21:24] and then um
[1:21:26] the
[1:21:28] i told my mom about it
[1:21:31] because i i told her just to go home
[1:21:34] entonces
[1:21:36] because she wasn't sleeping
[1:21:39] i told my dad that she wasn't sleeping
[1:21:43] so they started taking turns
[1:21:47] where my mom would stay with me all day
[1:21:49] and on the uh
[1:21:52] and and then she would leave yellow
[1:21:54] and
[1:22:06] and this was during the day where my mom
[1:22:08] was here
[1:22:19] can you leave the room please just to
[1:22:21] talk to him real privately
[1:22:29] [Music]
[1:23:00] and it also affects
[1:23:02] um just just to uh say it like this
[1:23:08] if you want to have
[1:23:09] kids one day
[1:23:12] so the plan is
[1:23:15] to um

[1:23:28] for later
[1:23:30] so that if you want to have kids
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:45] and then she says she's just looking at
[1:23:47] me
[1:23:49] and then i was looking at her
[1:23:52] so she's like so
[1:23:53] do you want to think about the decision
[1:23:59] and i said no
[1:24:01] no no i don't want to do it
[1:24:04] she's like
[1:24:05] well you know what if you want to have
[1:24:07] kids later on
[1:24:13] you never know if you need it
[1:24:17] i said

[1:24:20] it's okay
[1:24:21] and she's like oh okay nico oh
[1:24:24] yeah she looked at her squad
[1:24:27] his squad was also confused
[1:24:31] so then they they also brought my mom
[1:24:33] back in entonces
[1:24:37] and i don't know why they made her leave
[1:24:41] me and then i said oh man
[1:24:44] i wonder what my mom's going to think
[1:24:45] about this um
[1:24:46] [Music]
[1:24:49] because my mom wants to be a nana one
[1:24:51] day
[1:24:54] so i don't know if she will say hey you
[1:24:56] know i want to be a nana one day you
[1:24:57] should do it
[1:25:02] so then they explained to my mom
[1:25:06] and she said oh
[1:25:08] okay
[1:25:10] well that's the decision
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:16] you can't make up his mind
[1:25:19] that was a little surprise
[1:25:22] so then the doctor left entonces
[1:25:39] kind you know didn't you know say why
[1:25:41] aren't you doing it or anything like
[1:25:42] that
[1:25:45] she just you know wanted to know why uh
[1:25:48] why the decision
[1:25:53] well you know i'ma look um i don't want

[1:25:57] squeamish
[1:26:05] you know it's like i don't know i don't
[1:26:07] want no thank you
[1:26:11] and you know
[1:26:13] if god is going to give me kids
[1:26:17] then god will give me kids
[1:26:20] i don't need to do all that scientific
[1:26:22] stuff
[1:26:26] you know that's my decision
[1:26:28] if i'm going to have kids one day
[1:26:32] god will give me kids one day
[1:26:34] look at abraham
[1:26:45] she gave the promise the promised son
[1:26:48] hello
[1:26:59] um if not well then that's not god's
[1:27:00] will
[1:27:09] so then they finally planned out my
[1:27:12] chemotherapy treatments
[1:27:22] and she started explaining me all the
[1:27:24] treatments that those start giving me
[1:27:30] you know
[1:27:42] and you know as
[1:27:43] human as a human reaction
[1:27:47] you know that that did kind of spook me
[1:27:49] a little yeah
[1:27:51] i like
[1:27:53] all right then
[1:27:55] you know
[1:27:57] if um
[1:27:59] if god wants me to go through this
[1:28:03] well then i gotta go through it
[1:28:06] you know i didn't want to go through it
[1:28:09] i wanted for them to you know scam me
[1:28:11] one more time and then you know oh
[1:28:13] nothing's there and then it's going to
[1:28:14] be a whole miracle
[1:28:21] but god had different plans
[1:28:24] just like the three hebrew hebrew men
[1:28:40] all the way to the hottest that they got
[1:28:46] but there was a fourth person in there
[1:28:51] so i said
[1:28:53] you know if i'm going to go through this
[1:29:09] the more i would identify myself with
[1:29:11] the characters in the bible
[1:29:12] identification
[1:29:15] and i and this made me um
[1:29:18] have
[1:29:19] you know i feel like god made me go
[1:29:21] through this
[1:29:29] let's say let's you know to in other
[1:29:31] words i wasn't backsliding
[1:29:35] but i was very relaxed
[1:30:01] they gave me a um a little
[1:30:04] a prayed pamphlet a little prayed a
[1:30:06] handkerchief
[1:30:10] and um you know

[1:30:15] we'll see you know just to you know have
[1:30:16] it with me

[1:30:30] jesus and one day
[1:30:42] [Music]
[1:31:28] i should be um not as desperate as i
[1:31:31] should be
[1:31:35] living this life
[1:31:38] so then um continuing forward yeah

[1:40:51] and they they sat me down
[1:40:54] and also a brother went up to help me as
[1:40:56] well
[1:40:59] and my dad prayed for me
[1:41:01] for me and i kind of woke up during the
[1:41:02] prayer especially
[1:41:05] i was like what happened
[1:41:07] and then i stood up again
[1:41:10] and my dad said you could stop
[1:41:13] i'm like no that's fine i'll continue
[1:41:16] so there i went
[1:41:22] um
[1:41:22] [Music]
[1:41:25] after my testimony this position
[1:41:27] testimonial i just told my mom uh
[1:41:31] [Music]
[1:41:44] because of my last the last dose of my
[1:41:46] chemo cause of the ultimate chemotherapy
[1:41:49] it would cause
[1:41:50] jaw pain
[1:41:53] in the mandible and it would cause
[1:41:56] pain in my stomach
[1:42:13] and this happened
[1:42:14] the symptoms kind of was there for
[1:42:16] around a week
[1:42:21] and
[1:42:22] thank god that you know finally um it
[1:42:24] stopped the symptoms
[1:42:39] and this time instead of going to the
[1:42:41] hospital
[1:42:42] hospital you know i would go to a clinic
[1:42:44] to do it
[1:42:47] and there and there i i was doing that
[1:42:49] for um
[1:42:50] [Music]
[1:42:52] for three months and a half now
[1:42:53] has
[1:42:56] you know there was times where i just
[1:42:58] you know
[1:42:59] couldn't go to church
[1:43:02] but if i felt good
[1:43:05] then then i would go to church let's see
[1:43:07] then i i didn't want to miss out
[1:43:11] and then finally before my second round
[1:43:17] i noticed there was a lot of hair on my
[1:43:18] pillow case um
[1:43:35] i will see here on my
[1:43:37] cover shampoo in my hand
[1:43:45] and i say well it's happening
[1:43:48] so before my second round is
[1:44:18] and you know
[1:44:20] and i knew it was falling so i just did
[1:44:21] it i went to get it over with anyways
[1:44:29] and there i was you know
[1:44:36] and honestly it happened for a very
[1:44:38] short amount of time
[1:44:44] i did my five rounds
[1:45:00] i would feel better and better each time
[1:45:03] you know it was kind of like this
[1:45:06] and um
[1:45:07] [Music]
[1:45:08] and i wouldn't i wouldn't feel bad as i
[1:45:11] did the first time
[1:45:13] come on
[1:45:21] where i just um
[1:45:24] i think i would i think um it was uh
[1:45:27] i kept thinking about uh how you know i
[1:45:30] would get nauseous and everything
[1:45:34] and i feel like that would that made me
[1:45:37] even um where i would take the medicine
[1:45:40] entonces
[1:45:42] that i would feel horrible
[1:45:44] because i was already getting ready to
[1:45:46] feel horrible
[1:45:50] so the last part
[1:45:51] that was my fault
[1:45:55] but during those
[1:45:56] times um
[1:46:00] it was around the third round
[1:46:05] before the third round
[1:46:07] they were gonna have a special speaker
[1:46:10] even antenna
[1:46:17] [Music]
[1:46:23] and i said well well i can try it
[1:46:27] you know i'm not really good in my
[1:46:29] spanish
[1:46:31] but i could try
[1:46:33] and he said okay
[1:46:35] but that wednesday i was going to take
[1:46:37] my chemotherapy
[1:46:45] [Music]
[1:46:51] it was all god told
[1:47:06] as if
[1:47:18] i knew god was with me the whole time
[1:47:21] because i knew it was god from the start
[1:47:26] he never he never made my parents go in
[1:47:28] debt from the hospital
[1:47:34] or because of the chemo or cause dela
[1:47:36] chemotherapy it was all covered for from
[1:47:38] my from my insurance
[1:47:41] so i knew it was god from there
[1:47:46] and finally um
[1:47:48] after the last
[1:47:50] chemo round especially the chemotherapy
[1:47:54] they scanned me miss canelo and they and
[1:47:57] then
[1:47:58] when i finally visited the doctor to
[1:48:00] know the results
[1:48:02] of
[1:48:44] we do um we're thinking about you taking
[1:48:47] radiation
[1:48:51] i don't i don't want to take that
[1:48:54] and you know um the doctor continued
[1:48:58] you know i was talking to my team
[1:49:02] and half of my team would say yes you do
[1:49:04] need it and half of my team would say no
[1:49:06] you don't need it
[1:49:12] because your mass is that size now
[1:49:17] usually if people will have that you
[1:49:19] know they don't need it
[1:49:23] but
[1:49:24] but because it was so big in the
[1:49:26] beginning
[1:49:30] we we recommend for you to do it
[1:49:34] but this time it's optional
[1:49:37] so it's optional if you want to take it
[1:49:39] or not yes i'll go optional
[1:49:50] and you know she started listing all the
[1:49:53] side effects for that
[1:50:04] [Music]
[1:50:13] you know the radiation can also cause
[1:50:15] another cancer
[1:50:18] cancer skin cancer cancer
[1:50:22] you know i
[1:50:23] i said
[1:50:24] you know i was thinking to myself
[1:50:26] and the doctor
[1:50:28] the doctor said
[1:50:30] you know you know we'll let you think
[1:50:31] about it
[1:50:34] and if you don't want to take it
[1:50:36] then
[1:50:46] it's something of your choice to do
[1:50:50] to
[1:50:59] and
[1:51:00] and then um
[1:51:02] the doctor left
[1:51:05] and is was thinking about it
[1:51:08] and i said um
[1:51:11] no it's already dead
[1:51:14] i never accept it in the beginning
[1:51:26] and i will never have it
[1:51:29] and finally the nurse came finally
[1:51:32] and she said well
[1:51:46] muerto and then they brought all the
[1:51:48] nurses
[1:51:50] and they started to you know sing a song
