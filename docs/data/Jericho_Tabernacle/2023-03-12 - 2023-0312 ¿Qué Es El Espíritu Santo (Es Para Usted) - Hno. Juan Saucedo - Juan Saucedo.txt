both sides are very happy we're going to read a scripture on Saint Mark chapter 10 verse 13. so our Doctrine doesn't teach us to sprinkle water on her or baptizing water but okay but it's to present her to the Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to read Saint Mark 10 chapter 13 or verse 13. and they brought young children to them that he should touch them and the disciples rebuked those that brought them Jesus sending me days he said but when but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God it says verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter it thereinos and he took them up in his arms put his hands on them and he blessed them

Jesus Christ how many here are you ready to receive it The Chosen vessel for this morning is our brother Juanito Salcedo is Santos [Music] cuanto is praying for our brothers [Music] thank you [Music] but again [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] animals [Music] [Music] with me [Music] [Music] videos [Music] we have more than three here this morning but there's no doubt there's some places where they only have two three [Music] but it's only the the pure truth can you read your Bibles with me [Music] open your Bibles while you're looking for I want to say to everyone I appreciate the ministry of the young men that we have among us to say it this way this morning they set the platform for me I'm gonna say some things that they have already said yes we hope that God will help us this morning and be with us how many are happy with these young ministers that the Lord has given us it touched my heart [Music] the report that he gave us and then we heard him in Tucson and I was very happy and glad my brother Emmanuel mirmano Lee my brother Marcos and then on Friday it was brother Marcos where's brother Marcos foreign and we're going to read verse 18. [Music] verse 28. is if you have it is foreign and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the hands made in those days will I pour out my spirit and I will show wanders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke oh let us pray our heavenly father glorios we thank you this glorious morning such a beautiful glorious morning that we have the opportunity you have granted us the opportunity to walk to this place again to hear your words there's many places that don't have a pasture they don't have a church but they get together at a house and there they honor the resurrection [Music] but what a privilege that we have this morning Phoenix speaking locally here in the city of Phoenix where you give us the opportunity to fellowship with each other yes and to hear your word we're a blessed people so help us with everything this morning lead us in everything may we set aside a alent Iglesia I believe one time brother Adam said I only wish to be a doormat coming into church sometimes that's how I feel better I just merely want to be a doormat where the brother can clean off their feet before coming into church so Lord help us this morning [Music] and we come to find errors and mistakes we'll also take those with us but I believe we all come with a desire to come better than when we came in thank you Lord help us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen we thank the musicians and you may be Cedar Brothers gracias we think brother Octavio for the for the trust and the confidence it's uh several of us the brothers that are helping you know and undoubtedly the brother has to be in a lot of prayer under the leadership where can I said this brother where can I place this brother in this building it's not an easy thing no lawyers it's not and then the brothers that on Fridays have spoken to us mano and when I when we exit I agree brother Octavio and I said that was very beautiful the testimony that the brother gave us tonight really helped me out Gloria dios so we thank God for that so when it's our turn we have to come asking God for help that's why we come to try to help amen Hermanos amen Brothers one time there was a sister that asked permission to give a testimony and after they gave her permission I'm not what I ought to be and how many of us can say the same thing I'm not what I should be we're not what we used to be that prayer really touched me this morning and it seems that brother Luis or one of the young men touched that scripture a while back how is it that Daniel went to the river and began to pour out his heart unto God and he said we have sinned he said we have Nosotros he says we have failed noise not hearkening to the voice of your prophets and that's the truth the reason why they were in Babylon is the old because they refuse to listen to the true prophet of God 70 years you'll be there and he said the other Prophet then came and said it's not 70 it's only going to be okay of course we'll like that better it's not 70 but yeah and he had horns with him it won't be 70 it's only going to be two but it was 70. young children when they went into captivity but Daniel's studying and searching the writings of Jeremiah blessed be the name of the Lord just as we go and we get a message and we go get another message it's the same thing we have the promises what we need is there So Daniel suddenly realizes he takes notice that they were for 68 years in captivity in Babylon the Lord God had taken care of them but he noticed that there was two years left to to uh sum up the 70 years and when he saw that he ran to the river to pour out his heart before the Lord he says we're guilty we have been killed we deserve this we deserve all of this but you're a forgiving God foreign [Music] Jeremiah says 70 years so it's going to be 70 years it's going to be seven years but now 68 had passed and Daniel's searching reading that's what we should do as well not lead everything up to the preachers many times we rejoice when we come to church and we hear the brothers we hear the other brothers and that's something that we have already read on Friday uh I went to go preach to the at the brothers church that visited us on Friday Oscar is I'm quite forgetful this morning I left my house with my coffee I left with my water speaker I left with my little speaker and guess what I left my 45 at home and when I was going to get my brick face where's the where's the briefcase I didn't have anything and today I have to preach just imagine that I said to my wife get out and I'm going back home and hopefully I get all green lights in the stoplights and if there's a red light well Lord forgive me for that and I'm on my way and then suddenly I get a call John Paul's on his way oh Hermano by the way today the morning's uh title is the what is the Holy Ghost Hermanos I've heard the rest of the brothers I like I said I heard brother Louise I heard brother Emmanuel brother and today I told Brother this whole time I was between two things on the dates when we're going to be up here then your stomach is you know what a stomach ache is you're nervous your nervousness and the Ducks are inside and they're like nothing's going on they dipped their head and then they come back up but if you can get under the water you can see their little legs they're going back and forth the little legs going back and forth blessed be the name of the Lord so may God help us and bless us it's such a nervous thing so Daniel reading the writings of the Prophet Jeremiah he realized that there was two years and he began to pour out his soul before he began to ask forgiveness for himself and for the rest we have we have we have because he uh counted himself with the rest and Daniel was a good man Daniel had a good testimony stood up while in Babylon for what he believed he didn't worship the image they cast him into the lion's den but you know what happened they cast him into the lines and when they come to look in then he had a a line as it had as his headrest just imagine what God does God is good God knows what he's doing man amen So Daniel at all he didn't work he obeyed the almighty glory to his name three times you would open as well that was facing towards Jerusalem and you would ask God for mercy and Grace I can imagine when he realized that there was two years glory to his name we're leaving we're about to leave there's two years left we're about to leave that it's the same thing with us how many are ready to leave California brother Brandon was preaching a message in California and brother Brad I'm saying I would be so happy if this would finally reach its ends and we can finally go with our Lord Gloria praise His name as Paul said I'm between I'm betwixtures Lord I want to go to be with you but I'm betwixties because if I say that is to help our brothers so blessed be the name of the Lord that's how many of us feel we're uh in between two things we're waiting for that Resurrection there can't be a Rapture I'll say it again there cannot be a Rapture Resurrection without first having the resurrection there first has to be a resurrection blessed be the name of the Lord Esperanto how many are waiting foreign your tears and when I hear the word the word brings joy to my heart so glory to his name when the worship comes sometimes you see me that I'm running it's the worship and the praise so raise up your hands worship it's the time to do so but we're afraid we're scared we we have we are but you should worship raise up your hands raise them up when you raise your hands you're showing that you surrender to him and I surrendered to him this morning take over my life the glory to his name [Music] when you raise your name you raise your hand it's because you surrender glory to his name don't let what happened to an American in Mexico happen to you the Americans didn't know that much Spanish he only knew a little bit of Spanish so then the thieves came and they put two knives in front of his stomach and they said he said the wallet raise your hands so he understood that part raise your hands and he says give me your wallet or your life and these were obviously turning everywhere and he with his hands up he was surrendering when you raise your hands you're surrendering no one has a a knife or a pistol it's his holy ghost that is touching you it's the holy ghost that tells you to raise your hands so blessed be the name of the Lord even we're lazy even to do that raise your hand please raise your hands show God you're surrendering to him show God that you're surrendering to him give me your money or your life and he wouldn't answer or reply anything just with his hands up come on come on give me your money or your life and you know what he said in the end he says wait wait wait I'm thinking on what to do it's not time to think on what to do take out your wallet and give it to him foreign take off your shoes and the money that you're having issues give it to him as well because they're going to ask for what you're hiding in your shoes take off your shoes your socks brothers from Mexico City they lost you from Mexico City yes yes and even Guadalajara it happens too not only in Mexico City we were on the bus there wasn't any seating are just standing up from during the whole journey through Mexico Jesus and my brother Jesus was there the father of a sister that's here this morning and when we got there and dropped off they took uh the wallet from him if we were just grabbing on they took it from him now let me tell you something more serious I was coming from that City from to Mexico City [Music] I was uh going from a bus that was going to take me to the metro and when I'm dropping off there at the Metro I do this to check my what time it is and I didn't have my watch brothers from Mexico City Javier hermano brother Gloria glory to his name amen amen I didn't even feel at what time they they took away my watch and it was a good watch it was a Citizen watch one of the most expensive ones at that time in New Mexico and they stole it from me why because I fell asleep that's why when brother Johnny when he would get up he says Be watchful the shrimp that falls asleep [Laughter] whoever falls asleep but that day when he went to a church and God touched his heart the whole time my father was crying he got home yoran he was crying sister Yolanda comes to see him and he's crying and he kneels to ask for forgiveness and sister Yolanda Caesar sanus where'd you take him he took him to a place where he got Jesus the Lord Jesus in his heart when you receive him you're no longer the same you're no longer the same the woman said I'm not what I ought to be but I'm certain of one thing I'm not who I once was let that be the same thing with us if there's still something that's lingering the Holy Ghost is here to help us glory to his name how many of us can go with our hands there's no reason to put a wrench behind it it's a sign that we're surrendering to him this morning it's a sign that we need something from him Acts 2 [Music] we're going to read some verses there Acts 2. 0 beginning with verse 17. did you find it let me read first acts 1 8 this morning we're speaking about on what is the Holy Ghost Brothers we can't receive something uh without first knowing what it is is that true we can't receive something without first knowing what it is when you know what it is and you know that it's for you then you know that it's a promise that was made for all of us Look what Jesus said here in verse 8. power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you he was about to leave he was about to leave then and notice what his Apostles are answering and he said and he shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the year when the Holy Ghost will come I think it was brother Luis I said you can't be a witness you have to be a witness and you're a witness because you saw something we cannot be Witnesses unless we first saw something but when we see it when we hear it because he's done so many things because he's done so many things with you we hope that everyone has a chance to give a chance if there's a brother because God has done so many things with us and that's why you're here this morning we can be somewhere else because he did something in us the glory to his name amen Hermanos amen Brothers Royal [Music] he found it those this is and in the last it shall come to pass that in the last day saith God is my spirit upon All Flesh it was through Secrets it was and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy that is the Fulfillment of Joel amen Brothers Years prior to that happening that in the latter days in the last days he will power his Spirit Upon Our flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and now look at verse 18. and on my servants and handmaidens I in those days so brother Marcus mentioned Azusa Street and I've read that story the man that God used in that place he was a descendant from slaves and he was missing an eye he was missing an eye the presence of the almighty was shedding us up there so may the name of the Lord be glory he says where is that where is the Welsh Revival and he answered he was uh he pointed to himself with that club that he was he was pointing to himself and he said it's in my heart when the Holy Ghost comes I think his brother Emmanuel that mentioned it he says we visited churches in the message and we've seen we've seen yes and we've heard the way that they sing the way they play the instruments the way that they sing and then we can see how they raise their hands many are crying many are running I'm a runner and I'm not ashamed why because you've already seen me why be embarrassed I think one time a son of mine told me that brother Flores fell over it's good for the Sisters to come and stand behind the other sisters and we've seen that before because they fall back and it's a good thing that the other sister's there to help her out and thank you to the sisters [Music] it seemed weird to them so they said they're drunk on new wine or they're drunk but Peter rolls up and said among the 11 Peter Rosen said now notice in Acts 2 14. and those are [Applause] it was no longer that Peter that said to the woman it's not me you're mistaken hopefully that never happens to us because we must be Witnesses have you seen something then you're a witness have you felt something you're then a witness a glory to his name God has healed you you're a witness then glory to his name amen yes you're a witness he or she is I'm not speaking about the Jehovah Witnesses but we're Witnesses real Witnesses [Music] maybe there's no funds and you just keep it to yourself and maybe no they were mistaken he makes no mistakes he's never made a mistake so glory to his name it's in it's in your name so go to the bank and cash it out so blessed be the name of the Lord one time I was in my truck and my supervisor came to me oh I was listening to a message and I come and open the window and he had an envelope a big one and he gives it to me he says do you know what this is but I saw that it had my name on it and he says do you know what this is and I said I don't have the slime foreign whatever you have but just give them to me Gloria glory to his name hermanosion there's a blessing when you give as well God blesses you in God one way or the other God will bless you there's a text and the Bible says I was young and I apply that to myself I remember when I saw that Chihuahua they would go through Mexico and I saw that those were beautiful buses I said one day I'ma drive that bus and I was just a little okay a little a little kid you're dreaming right I didn't even have any shoes with me at the time but I would say one a day one of these days I'll drive one of those buses I said one day one day saying that one day I'll drive a bus Los Angeles okay and I mentioned before and I saw that there's wrinkles there I have wrinkles so I I put my eyes real close and I saw that there's wrinkles okay please what happened I was once young but now I'm old little pillow now look at my hair and don't worry if you make fun of me you're having jokes like me Marcos Terrace best you see this one you'll be the same is living for others may God forgive us but do you know what we do many times he's my friend he won't notice but he will notice the Bible says search not for your own good but foreign it's Christ in you it's Christ in you to Santo s another thing that the Holy Ghost is look what it says in the message the bridge I don't know if the brothers have it I've already passed over so many things and the message the bridge page 73. the 17th of March 1963. you know this is the prophet says paragraph 72 he says another thing that still signifies is ownership how many believe it I believe it this morning see the seal has a mark on it shows ownership why did the supervisor come and give me the envelope because they had my name is that envelope didn't belong to anyone else it only belonged to me amen amen as the numbers as you see the seal has a mark on it shows ownership it says when you are bobbed by the blood of Jesus Christ you no longer belong to the world or anything pertaining to it you are owned by God I love our brother Marcos preached De La Cruz the thief on the cross that was his last chance that was his last chance and Jesus said has done nothing wrong but then the words that came from him he said Lord remember me when you're in your kingdom [Music] but the Lord took him to a beautiful and lovely place and he did not get baptized he did not get the chance to be baptized but what about us you say oh brother that's good I have no intention on getting baptized because we do have the chance we're given the chance so glory to his name amen so Brothers when you accept the Lord when you confess him when you fully surrender to him and Don says then that will take you to this spot that we have back here when I was in Torreon I said one time I knew that I was already baptized and I wasn't sure if I was baptized in this name I think it was only backwards but nevertheless preached a message on baptism that it must be done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and here I come running and when I got baptized just a desire to do it and God will provide the rest so glory to his name but brother also mentioned that can you go we're bringing a dry sinner we wet him and then he comes out as a wet Center because surely there was no repentance and truly there was no change to do everything while we have life and health amen and then another thing brother Brandon says is a CEO it represents security means that you are secured you are secured glory to his name this is now you that don't believe in internal security he says he says but now a seal signifies security to a that people said the devil made me do it what a poor devil we blame him for so much and sometimes he's just resting relaxing he's sleeping taking a nap and we're the ones that go to wake him up they said I'll go knows this and he says now some say s you all have heard me that said that people said the devil made me do this is that isn't the truth he says that isn't true he says the devil didn't do it he says the truth is you just wasn't sealed in where are there in Houston this is the the thing is that you justice was wasn't sealed in cause when you are sealed in he is sealed out even though the devil wants to come and he can't glory to his name because you're sealed in glory to his name so the devil is sealed out so this is what happened what happened is that you went out to him the devil he couldn't get into you because the only way to get into you speaking about us he's speaking about the devil Satan this is because the only way he can get into you it's come through the same process that you have and for that speaking of the devil he would have to be saved and consequently afterwards he'd be your brother and Don says so you see the devil wasn't the one who said yo it says you just went to the borderline you went to the borderline and come back last lusting for the things of the world you never went all the way over into Kings you see across Jordan which is death to self you fight for every inch of ground we have to fight for every inch of ground brothers and to do that we need his spirit inside us so this morning I hope God can bless you and God keep you I I didn't finish I'll finish some other time just in closing I want to ask you pray for my wife and myself on March 31st we'll be boarding a plane for three days going to Puerto Vallarta on Tuesday we'll be going to Guadalajara for two days [Music] and then on the fourth we'll be going on a bus to go to Mexico [Music] Mexico City uh the faith that saves when I left escouch I heard the conversations and this was the conversation he invited brother Johnny to go to Mexico City and when I I'm passing by and I heard this Johnny [Music] and some other brothers were there as well now everything touched my heart but what really struck my heart was what brother Eli mentioned that brother Octavio walked over and leaned in to where the brother Daniel was and he said he says tell brother Johnny that we're doing the best that we can it's always have that with me Gloria so glory to his name he's in a better place than Mexico City and that this missionary work that was in the heart of brother Johnny I hadn't seen him for years but God turned him into a magnet do you know what a magnet is I'm closing my time is up if the musicians can come please come a magnet you know what a magnet is put it to the other object that has a magnetism you need to have one to be able to make contact with him and I believe that for many of us brother Brian brother Johnny was a magnifier I stopped seeing him for many years [Music] but the last times that God allowed me to see him for me he was a magnet and now we're here you'll see me here again next Sunday [Music] okay sometimes we don't actually kick the dog but we're nudging him wanting him to leave and he and he takes off and now we're happy because and then you turn around and he's there again that's me so this is where we'll say this is this morning I joined with Daniel's prayer please we failed we've committed iniquities we've sinned we haven't heard what your Prophet has said but

too heavy and I can't take it anymore I can't bear it anymore it's too heavy is could you give me a smaller one special with that is lighter in weight and the the story says that God said yes you see that warehouse over there there's crosses there pesos of different sizes and weights [Music] go and pick the one that you want [Music] the first thing that he saw were the crosses in the weights and he got the smallest one he got the smallest one and when he left out with it he said God told him the one year living behind is smaller than the one that you just took but for us it seems to be very happy there's mountains that we can't climb there's valleys that scare us there's Giants in the land come on [Music] we're like nothing before them [Music] but he promised to go before us foreign
