[21:25] [Music]
[21:31] [Music]
[21:38] [Music]
[22:10] hey man
[22:22] just like we're standing we can please
[22:23] bow our heads
[22:38] we
[23:22] just as we are like to go to the book of
[23:24] genesis the 49th chapter
[23:27] verse 10.
[23:33] you can say amen once you have it
[23:38] the word says
[23:50] this
[23:51] scripture shall not depart from judah
[23:53] nor a law giver from between his feet
[23:56] until shiloh come and unto him shall the
[23:58] gathering of all the people
[24:02] i want you to notice in genesis you know
[24:05] the book in genesis
[24:08] persona
[24:09] as a person
[24:13] i want to go to joshua 18.
[24:16] verse 1.
[24:36] the whole congregation of the children
[24:38] of israel assembled together as shiloh
[24:40] and set up the tabernacle of the
[24:42] congregation there and the land was
[24:43] subdued before them
[24:59] genesis speaks of shiloh
[25:02] una persona as a person
[25:05] but in joshua
[25:08] the bible speaks of shiloh come on lugar
[25:11] as a placebo
[25:32] you're going to find a lot of
[25:32] contradictions in the world
[25:37] but when one receives the revelation of
[25:39] the word el cuadra
[25:54] that all of the old testament is
[25:56] sombra is type in shadow of the history
[25:59] of jesus christ
[26:06] so this is my my title for this evening
[26:11] to speak of the tabernacle
[26:13] and speak of shiloh
[26:18] different descriptions
[26:54] in the early days when they will come up
[26:56] to shiloh for the blessings of the lord
[27:00] and now tonight
[27:04] we have assembled here to hear your word
[27:09] it's a place
[27:12] where the people were gathered
[27:15] by the ram will also say
[27:31] it's a place where they will assemble or
[27:33] gather together
[27:37] the message
[27:41] god's wrapped gift
[28:00] it was
[28:30] [Music]
[28:41] heavenly peace tranquility
[28:56] in palestine a place in palestine
[29:03] like i said genesis 49
[29:08] that all the people will be gathered
[29:10] there in shiloh
[29:12] will be gathered unto him
[29:18] therefore the bible makes no mistake no
[29:20] comment contradictions doesn't make any
[29:22] contradictions
[29:40] but there's going to be something that's
[29:41] going to connect both of them
[29:44] the same thing with these scriptures
[29:47] there's a reason why god says
[29:50] that here it's a person
[29:52] and over
[30:05] it has different names in english in
[30:07] english
[30:09] vernaculo de la congregacion it's called
[30:10] the tabernacle of the congregation
[30:14] and the tabernacle of the witness
[30:16] espanol but in spanish
[30:20] it's the tabernacle of assembling
[30:22] together
[30:25] and the tabernacle of the testimony
[30:32] i want to speak on what the tabernacle
[30:34] of the assembling together
[30:36] because god says
[30:41] two or three gathered in my name
[30:44] there i would be idiots
[30:46] god told moses
[31:02] we
[31:13] all amongst us
[31:43] as we suddenly look to the word of the
[31:45] living god
[31:49] and speaking on the subject of
[31:51] dedicating of the building
[31:54] i would like to make this statement
[31:58] that is known among
[32:27] if god is omnipresent
[32:30] just like the atmosphere
[32:32] then he is a myth
[32:35] but god is a person
[32:37] therefore
[33:22] the reason why he's everywhere
[33:26] because he knows that everything that's
[33:27] going on
[33:30] and if god was to be in every place
[33:34] and sin will not be able to exist
[33:38] because god cannot live or dwell with
[33:40] our sin
[33:44] but god himself dwells in a certain
[33:46] place
[33:48] god told moses
[34:01] and that building was placed in shiloh
[34:04] now
[34:46] is
[34:56] [Music]
[35:00] there
[35:42] and it's also a place
[35:47] and ii samuel 7 6
[35:52] speaking concerning the tabernacle
[35:56] now
[36:05] whereas i have not dwelled in any house
[36:07] since the time that i brought up the
[36:09] children of israel out of egypt even to
[36:11] this day una casa a house
[36:15] something stable
[36:18] something that would not be moved to
[36:19] place to place
[36:23] so i have not dwelt in any
[36:38] can walk
[36:43] in that place
[36:47] but when you see the building
[36:50] you only see things
[36:52] you don't see a
[37:06] towards another tabernacle
[37:28] since the day that i brought up to
[37:29] israel to this day
[37:34] but i've gone from 10 to 10 and from one
[37:35] tabernacle to another
[37:38] aura
[37:42] it's a person
[37:44] it's a place
[37:46] and it's a place of gathering together
[37:48] fuel guardios
[37:52] whether god placed a tabernacle there in
[37:54] that place
[37:58] first samuel in chapter four algo paso
[38:01] and silo something happened there in
[38:02] shiloh album something very serious
[38:07] if you read the first three chapters
[38:10] of first samuel habla
[38:13] talks about the priests of uh the sons
[38:15] of eli the priest eli
[38:30] samuel 4 3 says
[38:34] los angeles
[38:39] and when the people were coming to the
[38:40] camp the elders of israel said wherefore
[38:42] hath the lord spent us today before the
[38:45] philistines
[38:54] let us fetch the ark of covenant of the
[38:56] lord unto shalom unto us that when it
[38:58] cometh among us it may save us out of
[39:00] the hand of our enemies
[39:17] so the people sent to shiloh that they
[39:19] might bring from hence the ark of the
[39:21] covenant of the lord of hosts which
[39:23] dwelleth between the cherubians and the
[39:25] sons of eli hofney and vanessa's were
[39:28] there with the ark of the covenant of
[39:29] god
[39:38] and when the ark of the covenant of the
[39:40] lord came into the camp all over israel
[39:42] shouted with great shouts so that the
[39:44] earth rang again
[39:58] and when the philistines heard the noise
[39:59] of the shout they said what meaneth the
[40:01] noise of this great shout on the camp of
[40:03] the hebrews and they understood that the
[40:05] ark of the lord was come into the camp
[40:37] behind that thing
[40:43] verse 10.
[40:49] and the philistines fought in israel and
[40:51] israel was smitten
[40:55] and they fled every man into his tent
[41:02] and there was very a great slaughter for
[41:04] their fellow israel thirty thousand foot
[41:06] men
[41:12] and the ark of god was taken the sons of
[41:14] ilahafny and finas were slain
[41:18] now if you study
[41:33] of eli
[41:35] and because of that
[41:38] the ark was taken
[41:40] it was stolen
[41:43] now if you sin
[41:45] in gran manera in great
[42:12] for they provoked him to anger with
[42:14] their high places and moved him to
[42:15] jealousy with their graven images
[42:22] when god heard this he was wroth and
[42:23] greatly upheld israel
[42:32] so that he forsook the tabernacle of
[42:33] shiloh the tenth which he placed among
[42:36] men
[42:38] the reason why god left shiloh recorded
[42:41] a persona remember a person
[43:35] where the people will gather with to him
[43:37] with him
[43:53] onsen verse 11.
[44:04] is this the house which is called by my
[44:06] name become a den of robbers in your
[44:08] eyes
[44:12] doesn't that remind you of another
[44:14] scripture
[44:16] when jesus entered the temple
[44:48] where god is living in escueva de la
[44:51] drones
[44:53] esta casa s
[44:56] become a den of robbers which is called
[44:58] by my name
[45:01] behold i've even seen it saith the lord
[45:03] andada ora ami lugarencilo but going out
[45:07] to my place which was in shiloh
[45:10] al principio where i set my name at the
[45:12] first
[45:15] so god placed his name in silo in shiloh
[45:23] pueblo ira and see what i did to do it
[45:25] for the wickedness of the people of
[45:27] israel my people of israel is a persona
[45:30] shallow as a person
[45:41] the wickedness of the sins of the people
[45:57] and now because you have done all these
[45:58] work saith the lord and i spake unto you
[46:00] rising up early and speaking but you
[46:02] hear he heard not and i called you but
[46:04] he answered
[46:11] yes
[46:16] therefore what i do onto this house
[46:18] which is called by my name wherein ye
[46:20] trust and on to the place which i gave
[46:22] to you and unto the fathers i said back
[46:24] done to shiloh
[46:39] to worship in the temple
[46:49] jeremiah 26 6.
[46:54] then will i make this house like shiloh
[46:57] yes
[47:02] de la tierra it will make this city a
[47:04] curse to all the nations of the earth
[47:08] so there being a place of blessing
[47:12] it became a blessing a cursed place
[47:18] all because of the the sins of the
[47:20] people
[48:04] for the youth is difficult
[48:06] in this world
[48:09] there's so many attractions that are out
[48:11] in the world
[48:14] but i know that also in your heart
[48:17] you don't want to do those things
[48:46] and
[49:00] that's why you have to come to christ
[49:02] and coming to christ
[49:05] you're humbling yourself before him
[49:08] because you're recognizing it
[49:12] that he's the only one that can help you
[49:13] with your problem
[49:28] in your path
[49:34] it was a great place
[49:37] a blessing
[49:38] of worship
[49:40] of gathering together
[50:10] it is types and shadows
[50:14] of better things of of to come
[50:19] there was another tabernacle that was to
[50:20] come
[50:23] but this tabernacle was not a building
[50:40] that's why he speaks that he spoke he
[50:41] put his name in the tabernacle
[50:46] but the name of the lord is the lord
[50:47] jesus christ
[50:50] it's a place
[50:52] it's
[51:48] notice how he interprets the scriptures
[51:54] now the gathering will be on to the lord
[51:56] commodity
[51:58] as jacob said in el capito
[52:00] in the 49th chapter
[52:02] as he
[52:17] go until from between the feet
[52:19] hasta que vegas until shalom come lando
[52:22] de judah speaking of judah
[52:26] and to him shall be the gathering bee
[52:30] so the gathering
[52:36] jeffersonville whether i am in
[52:37] jeffersonville or in suissa whether i'm
[52:40] in sweden
[52:42] whether i or whatever it is
[52:58] to meet the lord in the air
[53:02] people will come from all parts of the
[53:03] earth
[53:08] that's dead and so forth will rise
[53:40] i will gather all all the people on to
[53:42] me
[53:44] chris shiloh speaks of christ it's a
[53:47] persona it is a person yes
[53:50] also a place
[53:52] that's where moses made a tabernacle
[54:07] it's jesus christ
[54:14] in paragraph 144 he continues saying
[54:17] universal his coming will be universal
[54:21] it would not be just coming to
[54:22] louisville
[54:37] and the resurrection and the gathering
[54:39] shall be from everywhere
[54:42] restriction what is speaking of shiloh
[54:44] as a resurrection
[54:47] joshua
[54:48] jordan when he crossed jordan
[55:18] one thing to one person to one place
[55:22] christ
[55:25] shiloh is christ
[55:32] tiempo de jesus now shiloh has in his
[55:35] importance during the time of jesus
[55:40] expectancy
[55:43] brother brahms says
[55:46] speaking concerning of mary
[55:49] estaba
[55:53] and her wrote up she engaged to a man
[55:54] who had been married before
[55:57] they had four sons
[56:00] you
[56:25] truth came through jesus christ
[57:24] the parents are deciding what's going to
[57:26] be the name of that child
[57:28] jesus and before jesus was born
[57:33] was going to be his name
[57:37] and he sent a message to mary this is
[58:33] i found something that was very
[58:34] interesting jesus
[58:37] we see that jesus before he came
[58:40] in
[58:41] he had a messenger that came before him
[58:46] which is john the baptist
[59:30] now if you notice malachi 3.
[59:37] speaking that jesus said to john coming
[59:39] behold i will send my messenger el cual
[59:41] prepara el camino de lante de me and he
[59:44] shall prepare the way before me even
[59:50] and the lord whom he seeks shall
[59:52] certainly come to this temp to his
[59:54] temple
[1:00:01] even the messenger of the covenant whom
[1:00:03] you delight and behold he shall come
[1:00:05] saith the lord of hosts
[1:00:10] that was john announcing the coming of
[1:00:11] jesus
[1:00:29] you never really practiced the office of
[1:00:31] a high priest in the temple in the
[1:00:34] temple
[1:00:36] since it was a child he went to the
[1:00:38] desert
[1:00:40] but here speaks on malachi 3-1
[1:00:43] speaks of the messenger viniendo al
[1:00:46] temple coming to the temple
[1:00:48] temple
[1:00:49] what was the temple that he came to
[1:00:52] do
[1:00:53] at paragraph 233 this is
[1:00:58] jesus that was john announcing the
[1:00:59] coming of jesus
[1:01:01] temple and he came to the temple
[1:01:08] in
[1:01:10] exactly what he said the message of the
[1:01:12] covenant the angel in the wilderness
[1:01:14] with his disciples
[1:01:20] do you believe he was that messenger
[1:02:03] but in a person
[1:02:46] when the bible speaks to this person
[1:02:49] it speaks of this person like it was a
[1:02:51] place
[1:02:52] that's why
[1:02:54] it's a place
[1:03:00] remember
[1:03:29] his tabernacle
[1:03:32] jesus that god did the same thing with
[1:03:34] jesus
[1:03:40] instead of being a place of blessings
[1:03:54] 224
[1:04:11] his own self-prayer since in his own
[1:04:13] body on the tree para que nosotros
[1:04:15] estano muertos alos pecados
[1:04:22] that we being that descent should be
[1:04:23] left righteous by whose stripes ye or he
[1:04:26] were healed
[1:04:28] now when it speaks of shiloh it's a
[1:04:30] persona it is a person
[1:04:32] and it's a place
[1:04:34] vernacular where the tabernacle is at
[1:04:37] home
[1:04:37] that has the name of god
[1:04:49] [Music]
[1:05:18] and all that was the cause of the sins
[1:05:19] of the people
[1:05:25] that didn't christ became because of our
[1:05:28] curse because of us
[1:05:33] again on verse 24. this is
[1:05:48] i like how it says in english
[1:05:50] it says on the tree
[1:05:54] and deuteronomy 21
[1:05:56] 22
[1:05:58] this is
[1:06:02] and if a man have committed a sin worthy
[1:06:04] of death
[1:06:09] and he be
[1:06:10] he to be put to death and to hang him on
[1:06:12] a tree no deja esque
[1:06:16] his body should not remain all night
[1:06:18] upon the tree sinfalta
[1:06:21] el mismo
[1:06:23] wise bury him in that day porque maldito
[1:06:26] por dios es el colgado for he that is
[1:06:28] hang is a curse of god e
[1:06:57] and that's what they did with jesus
[1:06:58] christ
[1:07:00] he was hanging on a tree
[1:07:04] and he didn't remain there all night
[1:07:08] but quickly they took him off the cross
[1:07:11] and they went to go bury him
[1:07:27] for me
[1:07:28] it was my sin
[1:07:30] and it was your sins
[1:07:36] it could turn christ accursed
[1:07:39] just like shiloh
[1:07:54] place
[1:07:57] because of the sins of the people
[1:08:02] it became a cursed place
[1:08:06] christ did all of that
[1:08:08] for you me and for me
[1:08:18] notice in first peter 2 25.
[1:08:33] shepherd and the bishop of your souls
[1:08:45] returning back again speaking of shiloh
[1:08:47] uh
[1:08:49] now is a place of gathering
[1:09:04] will be for the gathering of the lord
[1:09:06] como dicco jacob and el capitolo nueva
[1:09:09] like it says jacob and the 49th chapter
[1:09:12] it says like this
[1:09:17] pueblos and the gathering will be on to
[1:09:19] him
[1:09:24] there will be no love or go away until
[1:09:27] from between the feet until shiloh come
[1:09:29] avilando de judah speaking of judah yeah
[1:09:40] in jeffersonville whether i'm in
[1:09:41] jeffersonville or in suica or whether
[1:09:44] i'm in sweden ocillo
[1:09:46] whether
[1:10:43] with the shepherd
[1:10:46] one last quote
[1:10:50] it is the rising of the sun
[1:10:54] the spirit left him in the garden of
[1:10:56] gethsemane
[1:11:11] the literal tabernacle
[1:11:13] the building
[1:11:15] for the cause of the sins of the people
[1:11:18] it was during seminary
[1:11:22] jesus began to receive the lord of the
[1:11:24] sins
[1:12:21] for suspicion
[1:12:22] because of your sins and my sins
[1:12:26] he had to die like a man
[1:12:30] remember friends he didn't have to do
[1:12:32] that
[1:12:33] that was
[1:12:36] god anointed that flesh
[1:12:40] which was human flesh
[1:12:44] and if if he didn't if he if he went up
[1:12:47] then it went up there as god nunca
[1:13:17] so when god looked down on the body of
[1:13:19] christ
[1:13:22] he saw both male and female fue tododo
[1:13:24] redemido
[1:13:26] it was all redeemed in that one body
[1:13:30] uno you see they're one lomismo same la

[1:13:35] del novion the same word spoke of the
[1:13:37] groom that means
[1:13:39] it speaks of the bride
[1:13:44] so then your your curse
[1:13:47] now is in christ
[1:13:50] now he paid the price
[1:13:52] to take away that curse
[1:13:55] now all of that chastisement del pecado
[1:14:51] and he said he was going to gather
[1:14:53] everyone all right
