[0:00] them
[0:01] directly and they would speak to the
[0:06] people it was God in the form of the
[0:08] pillar of
[0:09] fire in an exterior
[0:12] form that would guide the
[0:15] prophet and then the prophet would guide
[0:18] the
[0:21] people and then the time came when God
[0:23] came down and incardinated
[0:27] himself and we had the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:29] walking in between our
[0:32] midst they no longer had to follow these
[0:36] men which they followed a pillar of
[0:41] fire but God himself incarnated
[0:46] himself and then they followed the God
[0:50] man the Lord Jesus
[0:54] Christ but then the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:56] left the scene
[1:01] and it seems like we have now returned
[1:03] back to the old uh uh Old Testament
[1:10] times where these prophets would follow
[1:13] this exterior representation of God
[1:16] which was the pillar of
[1:18] fire but Jesus himself
[1:21] said that that they shouldn't be so
[1:25] sorrowful that I'm not going to leave
[1:28] you but I'm going to give you a
[1:30] uh a
[1:32] counselor I'm going to send you my
[1:36] representation and I'm going to send you
[1:37] the Holy
[1:39] Ghost now it will no longer be his
[1:42] exterior
[1:44] form but now he will be now within them
[1:47] as he was with the pillar of fire but
[1:50] now inside of
[1:52] them so that he could walk in
[1:58] them so then can follow that
[2:00] representation of the Lord Jesus
[2:03] Christ and then brother brandham
[2:06] says man is only a
[2:11] man until he completely surrenders unto
[2:17] God then at that point the deity of God
[2:20] dwells in that
[2:21] man the Holy
[2:23] Ghost it is no longer the
[2:27] man but it's God in the man
[2:31] which is doing all the
[2:34] work so then now it's no longer man
[2:37] that's leading
[2:38] us the the man that's preaching to us
[2:42] the man that's teaching
[2:44] us but it's God within that
[2:48] man the Holy Ghost which is guiding
[2:52] us but it seems a bit
[2:56] deceiving and today we also have
[3:01] that today a man
[3:02] came he came to
[3:05] us and he brought forth a
[3:08] testimony and he showed us great
[3:10] Miracles and
[3:12] wonders and he brought us a a
[3:16] message where only the
[3:18] few only the
[3:22] few we're going to worship the God that
[3:25] was in the
[3:27] man because there is a very fine line
[3:31] where they accuse us where they
[3:35] say
[3:37] you you worship a
[3:40] man no we worship the god that is in the
[3:44] man you glorify the
[3:48] man no we glorify the god that is in the
[3:51] man just as Paul said GL and they
[3:57] glorified God in green brother Perry
[4:01] green once
[4:04] said that he was accused of speaking so
[4:06] much about brother
[4:09] Bram that he would always speak about
[4:11] him and him and
[4:12] him and so then he
[4:15] responded and the truth
[4:18] is I feel that I don't speak enough
[4:20] about
[4:21] him I should and I should speak more
[4:24] about
[4:26] him because in speaking about brother
[4:28] brandham
[4:31] and speaking about the message that he
[4:33] brought the life that he
[4:36] lived the Miracles that happened
[4:38] throughout his
[4:40] ministry the more that he would speak
[4:42] about
[4:44] him the more of the glory he would give
[4:46] unto
[4:48] God because brother brandom never
[4:50] appointed it to
[4:54] himself his message always pointed to
[4:56] the Lord Jesus
[4:58] Christ and brother per
[5:02] said uh that there is no word in the
[5:04] alphabet to be able to
[5:08] describe or give enough Glory unto
[5:12] God can you imagine
[5:14] that we tell him that God
[5:17] Almighty the great miracle
[5:20] worker the the great
[5:24] king and word after word after
[5:28] word but yet there is still not enough
[5:30] words to be able to give him enough
[5:33] Glory because he is
[5:37] infinite and there is nothing that can
[5:39] actually describe the glory of
[5:45] God and if they could put the the
[5:47] slideshow of Hebrews
[5:49] 11:7 and it says like uh it says
[5:55] here by faith Noah being warned of God
[6:01] of things not seen
[6:06] yet moved with fear prepared an arc
[6:09] saving of his
[6:12] house by which the he condemned the
[6:18] world and became he of the righteousness
[6:21] which is by
[6:23] faith uh by
[6:25] faith or by faith Noah was uh warned
[6:31] of God of things that he has never heard
[6:34] of that he never
[6:38] seen he was hearing things that were
[6:41] contrary to the scientific
[6:44] researches how could it rain in that
[6:48] day how was it that the world was going
[6:50] to get
[6:52] flooded and by faith he heard and he
[6:56] obeyed by faith and fear and reverence
[7:00] he built an
[7:04] ark and by faith he was an heor to
[7:08] righteousness so then the key we see
[7:10] here is
[7:11] Faith and the faith in
[7:14] what in the voice of
[7:17] God how is it that Noah heard
[7:21] God he heard it through a
[7:24] voice a an audible
[7:26] voice and what is it that we hear today
[7:30] Donald Trump not the voices of Donald
[7:33] Trump not the voices of the government
[7:35] and the
[7:38] politics but we hear the voice of
[7:42] God a messenger sent from God from to
[7:48] us that comes directly from the Throne
[7:50] of God with a
[7:51] message as it was with
[7:54] no that he told Noah Build me an ark
[7:59] going to destroy the
[8:01] world go and preach to them to
[8:05] repent even though it was something
[8:07] strange that he couldn't
[8:09] understand because first of all
[8:11] Noah and in hearing this
[8:15] voice which was speaking contrary to the
[8:18] popular
[8:21] belief he first had to believe that that
[8:24] voice was coming from
[8:26] God and so then you have to go back to
[8:28] the scene of that
[8:31] day and it was never heard of such
[8:36] thing that it was going to Reign upon
[8:38] the
[8:39] Earth so then he believed that it was
[8:43] God and then after
[8:45] believing he had to
[8:49] accept that he was going to receive
[8:52] criticism from the whole
[8:56] world that he was going to be isolated
[8:58] and talked about by the whole
[9:01] world and just start to think about what
[9:04] was it that they were thinking about
[9:08] Noah when he brought forth these so
[9:11] strange and crazy
[9:13] ideas because he was just a single
[9:16] man he wasn't a whole
[9:20] church he wasn't a
[9:24] denomination he didn't have an
[9:26] organization backing him up
[9:29] it was just a single
[9:31] man with a single
[9:34] message even though it heard like a new
[9:37] message but it was not a new
[9:40] message it was a message of
[9:45] Salvation they heard of the message of
[9:47] Salvation in the times of Adam and
[9:49] Eve how there was going to be a day to
[9:51] be able to
[9:53] escape and how God was going to save
[9:57] them but they didn't know that recognize
[9:59] that this was the messenger for their
[10:02] day that there was going to be a an age
[10:05] of
[10:06] rescue for
[10:09] salvation and just in the act of being a
[10:11] new
[10:14] message or that it was something new and
[10:16] strange for their
[10:20] day that still didn't change the fact
[10:23] that it was a message from
[10:25] God something that God sent to his
[10:27] prophet
[10:29] to bring forth to his
[10:31] people just like just as it is
[10:34] today in our day in this age there was a
[10:39] prophet that came to preach the serpent
[10:44] seed and then the religious people were
[10:46] saying what are you talking
[10:49] about a prophet that came to talk to us
[10:51] about a chosen
[10:53] bride and then they say what are you
[10:55] talking about what is this about a bride
[10:59] we their
[11:00] church one
[11:03] Prophet that explained to us the seven
[11:05] Church
[11:08] ages and the religious World maintained
[11:11] themselves
[11:13] confused a prophet that opened us opened
[11:16] up the Seven
[11:17] [Music]
[11:19] Seals and the religious World stayed in
[11:22] in
[11:24] confusion those are the words of
[11:27] God towards a prophet
[11:31] to give unto a
[11:33] people but not only just a
[11:36] people but only a
[11:39] few just a small little
[11:42] sheep that was going to hear that
[11:45] voice and recognize what that voice
[11:48] is and recognize where that voice is
[11:50] coming
[11:52] from and accept that that's the voice of
[11:55] God only a few
[12:00] and then if you go into the book of uh
[12:03] Amos
[12:07] 37 and everybody should know the
[12:08] scriptures by now if they're message
[12:13] Believers surely the Lord God will do
[12:18] nothing but he reveal his secret unto
[12:21] his servants to who
[12:24] losetas the prophet losetas the prophets
[12:32] and if Jesus Christ was the same
[12:33] yesterday today and
[12:35] forever it has to be the same today in
[12:37] our
[12:38] day and God has sent us a
[12:42] prophet so that this scripture can once
[12:44] again be
[12:46] fulfilled and so then if I ask the
[12:47] question once
[12:50] again what kind of proof do you have
[12:52] that you've heard the voice of
[12:57] God can we say what kind of evidence
[12:59] that Noah or Moses heard uh have to be
[13:02] able to say that they heard the voice of
[13:07] God we could say that we didn't have a
[13:09] tangible uh evidence to be able to say
[13:11] that they heard the voice of
[13:14] God and I myself don't have something
[13:16] tangible that I can prove
[13:19] it but the one evidence that we should
[13:23] have it's that untangle
[13:26] evidence of the faith
[13:29] of
[13:32] faith that is hidden deep within the
[13:35] most uh deepest part in your
[13:38] heart where nobody can come and take it
[13:42] away and brother Bram said that there's
[13:44] no bomb on the
[13:45] earth and there's no Intelligence on
[13:49] Earth that can never destroy the faith
[13:51] of God in a child of
[13:54] God because faith will remain
[13:57] forever and there is no weapon on
[14:01] Earth and there's no science on
[14:04] earth that could ever destroy
[14:08] Faith that's why I rejoice when brother
[14:10] Jesse was preaching unto
[14:11] us what did he tell us uh the other
[14:15] Sunday that Faith knows no
[14:19] bounds why doesn't it know any
[14:22] defeats because that's what God
[14:25] Said and the word says
[14:29] the heavens and earth shall pass
[14:33] away but shall never pass
[14:36] away this body shall
[14:39] pass the planets of the universe shall
[14:43] cease but the word of
[14:45] God will never be
[14:48] defeated will never be
[14:51] destroyed and if my
[14:55] faith is anchored on that word
[15:01] and the essence of my Foundation is tied
[15:03] down to that
[15:05] word then my faith will never be
[15:09] destroyed because that faith and that
[15:11] word are
[15:12] one and they are
[15:15] Eternal this body shall pass
[15:19] away but my representation in Christ sh
[15:22] shall never pass
[15:24] away the word came to
[15:27] Noah the spoken word came
[15:34] Noah and it caused him to be known as
[15:36] the crazy man to the
[15:39] world a uh an ignorant
[15:43] man and the uh spoken word also came to
[15:46] Abraham and caused in
[15:49] him that he leave his
[15:52] family that he left his uh
[15:55] land and that he would also leave his
[15:57] religion
[16:00] and then the Curiosity kicked
[16:03] in I understand that uh the Bible says
[16:06] that Abraham used to worship
[16:10] idols and then I began to study and what
[16:12] kind of religion was Abraham coming
[16:16] from and then according to the Bible and
[16:19] then the history
[16:23] facts and then in the region in the time
[16:26] that he was living in
[16:30] they would worship the god of the
[16:33] Moon and then when this voice of God
[16:36] came to
[16:38] Abraham just as it came to
[16:43] Noah to give him a message that contrary
[16:46] to what they knew about and he believed
[16:49] it and here we have
[16:53] Abraham who also was worshiping the the
[16:56] god of the Moon
[16:59] idols and everything
[17:00] else he heard a
[17:03] voice a very strange voice something
[17:08] different contrary to what he already
[17:11] knew but even then with that
[17:15] voice that was speaking against contrary
[17:18] to everything that he knew
[17:21] about he recognized and obeyed that
[17:25] voice and that's why the scripture says
[17:30] my sheep hear my
[17:33] voice so then there had to be a
[17:36] representation before the foundation of
[17:38] the
[17:40] world so that just anybody here
[17:44] could that is entangled in another
[17:47] religion entangled in in
[17:51] sin or entangled in anything about the
[17:55] world that they when they hear that
[17:57] voice of God
[17:59] that we can turn
[18:01] around and then follow that
[18:06] voice not caring what kind of uh or how
[18:10] contrary it would go against our
[18:11] beliefs there was a
[18:14] voice that spoke onto a young
[18:17] man and and told him in an audible
[18:21] voice don't ever defile your body
[18:29] don't smoke don't
[18:33] drink because I have a purpose for
[18:37] you and this same
[18:39] voice told this young
[18:42] man now a
[18:45] man just as
[18:49] John was the first Forerunner of
[18:56] the you and your message shall be the
[18:59] second forerunning of the coming of
[19:01] Christ and in the same
[19:06] voice this
[19:08] matured being an
[19:11] evangelist being a
[19:13] pastor being a
[19:17] prophet if you can get the people to
[19:22] believe not that you deceive them into
[19:24] believing
[19:27] you but that you be sincere and that
[19:29] they
[19:33] genu even cancer can stand before
[19:37] you what a tremendous thing is to be
[19:39] able to go into that scene to see when a
[19:44] man can completely surrender themselves
[19:47] to
[19:48] God and accept the whole word of
[19:52] God and hear and obey the whole word of
[19:57] God the things that God can do with that
[20:02] man how God can give life in that gift
[20:05] of the
[20:07] man how would bring forth to life that
[20:09] ministry that's within that
[20:13] man but it is very necessary to hear
[20:15] that
[20:18] voice and if we're not hearing that
[20:20] voice of God
[20:22] today then we're hearing another voice
[20:27] world and it is very
[20:30] easy to hear the voice of
[20:34] men just as a man that's behind this
[20:38] Pulpit just as he is outside in the
[20:44] streets and just as brother bradam said
[20:46] that it is very necessary for that man
[20:47] to be
[20:50] filled to be filled with the deity of
[20:53] God so then then we can
[20:56] know that it is not the man
[21:00] but it is God in that
[21:02] man and then there's a
[21:06] saying uh saying that says that history
[21:09] repeats
[21:10] itself and Christians also have a
[21:14] saying and it is more than a
[21:18] say if I could say in that manner that
[21:20] this is an eternal
[21:22] declaration that history repeats
[21:25] itself but with the Christian we say
[21:31] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[21:33] today and
[21:34] forever just as he was
[21:36] before and he repeats himself and does
[21:39] itday and he repeats it and does it
[21:41] again
[21:43] tomorrow and brother B says that all
[21:46] scriptures have a a double
[21:50] fulfilling a double
[21:53] fulfilling in that
[21:55] fing it was hidden
[21:59] and it was hidden for The Prudent and
[22:01] the
[22:02] wise do you know who it was revealed
[22:06] to to the little
[22:08] ones to the
[22:10] ignorants to the
[22:13] nobodies to just the few were that
[22:17] revealed and so the Bible repeats
[22:20] itself Adam redeemed
[22:23] Eve josea redeemed
[22:26] go and Jesus Christ redeemed
[22:30] us and today the
[22:34] people they all believe or claim that
[22:37] they believe
[22:39] God and the things that they haven't
[22:41] even
[22:44] seen but just with the things that they
[22:46] see right
[22:48] now in their day and their
[22:52] generation that are going on in the
[22:55] world the wars and the things of the
[22:57] world
[22:59] they see it
[23:00] now but they can't and they don't want
[23:04] to accept or
[23:08] believe what God is doing in their
[23:12] day God already sent
[23:14] a we have them on
[23:17] video we have them on
[23:19] audio have it for
[23:22] written and there's so many
[23:25] testimonies of what God is doing today
[23:29] and what God has done
[23:32] today God sent a man with the spirit of
[23:36] Elijah that foran the first coming of
[23:39] Christ and so then he sent another
[23:42] man that will also have the spirit of
[23:46] Elijah to forun the second coming of
[23:50] Christ and the people cannot see
[23:53] it but only the
[23:56] few are the ones that are going to to be
[23:58] able to
[23:59] see be able to
[24:01] understand are going to be able to
[24:05] believe with that faith of
[24:07] God and the people
[24:09] themselves how they
[24:12] admire of the people in the
[24:15] past of how they would take a
[24:18] stand and how they would
[24:22] stand against those religious traditions
[24:24] in the
[24:26] past uh people like Martin Luther
[24:30] and all these Martyrs from the
[24:32] past but what about the
[24:34] today
[24:38] yesterday I ordered that book of um uh
[24:41] Fox of the
[24:43] martyrs I myself want to
[24:47] study I want to hear how these Martyrs
[24:51] were how was it that they stood up for
[24:54] Christ what is it that they suffered
[24:58] what is it that they had to go
[25:00] through in case is or is it that what
[25:03] I'm going through right
[25:05] now is it that my battles that I'm going
[25:07] through right now are they even worthy
[25:10] of
[25:12] Christ can they even compare themselves
[25:14] to what the martyrs went
[25:17] through and if I want to be a
[25:20] Christian I am also going to have to
[25:23] suffer it says in the scriptures that
[25:25] many are called
[25:28] but only a few are
[25:31] chosen only a few are
[25:34] chosen and how is it that I can identify
[25:38] myself with those
[25:40] few if he
[25:42] suffered then I'm going to
[25:44] suffer if he was
[25:46] rejected then I'm going to be
[25:49] rejected if he was
[25:51] crucified then I shall be crucified as
[25:55] well but if he resurrected
[25:59] then I'm going to resurrect as
[26:02] well and the scripture says in 1 Peter
[26:07] 2:21 for even here unto were ye
[26:13] called because Christ also suffered for
[26:17] us he suffered for
[26:20] us leaving us an
[26:25] example that ye should follow his steps
[26:29] if uh Christ
[26:31] suffered it was for a
[26:34] purpose for an example unto
[26:38] us and then just the act of being
[26:41] Christ then we're going to suffer like
[26:45] Christ that's why he left us his
[26:47] footprints in the
[26:49] S and then in John
[26:53] 16:33 these things have I spoken unto
[26:56] you that in me me ye might have
[27:00] peace how many of you are in Christ
[27:02] Jesus this
[27:05] morning then you have peace this
[27:10] morning in the world ye shall have
[27:14] tribulation all of you said that you
[27:16] were in Christ Jesus this
[27:20] morning but this carnal man where does
[27:23] he find
[27:25] himself he finds himself here on this
[27:31] Earth with afflictions and
[27:33] tortures and so
[27:36] on but the scriptures
[27:38] say in the world you shall have
[27:42] tribulation good
[27:44] cheer put your
[27:48] confidence that I have overcome the
[27:51] world so even though that I'm going to
[27:55] suffer even though I'm going through
[27:56] these tribulations
[27:59] and if if I am like
[28:02] Christ and if he overcame then I am
[28:04] going to
[28:06] overcome if he's my example then I am
[28:09] going to be an
[28:10] overcomer then we'll be more than an
[28:14] overcomer let us remember the age in
[28:16] which we live
[28:17] in
[28:22] the the seventh age is our age
[28:28] [Music]
[28:30] and if we try to align this religious
[28:31] world of
[28:32] today the Church of
[28:35] today to any other age in the
[28:40] world and the only one that it will
[28:42] dovetail with is the age of
[28:46] Leia because today is the perfect thing
[28:48] that what what the Bible is speaking
[28:51] of of the age of
[28:54] leoda and brother Bram
[28:56] says that
[28:58] means a
[29:01] woman the people's
[29:04] rights rich in need of
[29:07] nothing
[29:12] and the statue that represents the
[29:14] United
[29:18] States is the Lady Liberty Lady Liberty
[29:26] in and in the scripture that or the
[29:29] description of that
[29:33] statue it says that it's a woman that
[29:35] fights for her
[29:38] rights exactly what brother brandham
[29:40] describes about
[29:43] Le and if you research the the
[29:46] inspiration as to why this uh statue
[29:48] came to
[29:49] be it was designed and brought forth
[29:54] by to be as a resemblance to a Greek
[29:57] goddess
[29:59] uh which is the name
[30:01] Elia
[30:04] Liber uh that's her name in
[30:06] English it's a a a Greek
[30:11] goddess the goddess of
[30:16] Liberty and that is the statue that we
[30:18] have placed before our
[30:21] country and then when this uh statue was
[30:23] inaugurated and
[30:26] presented it was exactly 20 years
[30:31] after uh the Revival inza
[30:35] Street or 20 years before uh in
[30:41] 1886 and then the Revival on isza street
[30:44] was a
[30:47] 1906 which was also the beginning of the
[30:50] leodan
[30:52] age you see now how doveet tals with one
[30:56] another ending that age of
[31:01] Philadelphia and then beginning the age
[31:03] of
[31:06] leoda and Satan giving the footsteps for
[31:09] the leodan
[31:12] spirit and God himself giving the
[31:14] footsteps for the uh day of
[31:19] Pentecost giving those footsteps for
[31:21] those gifts of uh the holy ghost that
[31:26] followed and opening up the path for
[31:28] that uh the seventh
[31:31] messenger and in those years that
[31:34] dovetailed with one
[31:37] another Satan preparing himself but then
[31:39] also God preparing
[31:42] himself Satan preparing a
[31:44] woman that Lady
[31:47] Liberty that
[31:50] Goddess that Spirit of
[31:54] leoda movement of my rights
[31:58] and my rights and
[32:01] my but God was also preparing a
[32:04] woman a bride in this end
[32:09] time with power and demonstrations of
[32:11] the Holy
[32:13] Ghost bringing her through the whole
[32:16] full word of
[32:19] God and it says in Revelations chapter
[32:22] 3 and verse 13
[32:28] he that ha an ear let him hear saith
[32:31] unto the
[32:33] churches and unto the angel of the
[32:35] church age of
[32:37] leans write these things and the saith
[32:40] the
[32:41] amen the faithful and true
[32:45] witness the beginning of the creation of
[32:48] God because thou sayest I am
[32:51] rich and increased with
[32:55] goods and have need of nothing
[32:58] and knowest
[32:59] not that thou are wretched miserable and
[33:05] poor and
[33:09] naked
[33:11] behold I stand at the
[33:13] door and
[33:16] knock If any man hear my
[33:19] voice if there's anyone that can hear
[33:21] that
[33:23] voice in this day of
[33:25] leoda if they open the door
[33:28] I will come into him and will s with
[33:32] him and he with
[33:35] me and brother bam
[33:37] says the condition of the
[33:43] church I see that the church is going to
[33:45] the
[33:47] lean in this little
[33:49] isms and these all these
[33:52] Trends and these
[33:54] Sensations that are upon the church
[33:58] and they're separating one
[34:02] another marrying with the worst things
[34:04] that could ever
[34:06] happen and I know that it is
[34:09] time and I can't hold back
[34:12] anymore there's something within me that
[34:15] makes me
[34:16] shout return to the
[34:19] word return to the
[34:23] word can't you hear Brother
[34:25] Bram when he preached in Los
[34:29] choosing of a
[34:31] bride the kind of conviction that he
[34:34] had that it was no longer
[34:36] brother but it was God in the
[34:39] man that he would tell him
[34:42] repent
[34:44] repent that great and terrible day is
[34:48] coming then I can hear Brother brandom's
[34:50] voice here
[34:53] shouting return to the word
[34:58] and I believe that is for us to return
[35:00] back to the word but in this
[35:03] age Jesus finds himself
[35:06] outside outside of the church
[35:10] door out outside of the door of our
[35:15] heart and we're surrounded with so many
[35:17] Churches of Christ Billy Graham even
[35:20] Billy Graham he
[35:23] said if the Holy
[35:26] Ghost was taken of the
[35:31] churches 90% of the activities in the
[35:33] church would continue
[35:37] on only 10% would have the Holy
[35:42] Ghost would it be managed by the Holy
[35:46] Ghost but the other
[35:50] 90% it would be a program made by
[35:54] man because they no longer need Christ
[35:59] bil seeing that Billy Graham wasn't even
[36:01] a
[36:03] prophet he himself also had a level of
[36:08] revelation to be able to see this in the
[36:10] Book of Revelation chapter
[36:12] 3 to see the condition of the church in
[36:14] this
[36:16] day how is it that they have the Lord
[36:18] Jesus Christ
[36:21] outside and it is so sad to go into that
[36:25] scene to see how Jesus is outside of the
[36:28] church
[36:32] respectfully that hot summer Hut that it
[36:34] is here in
[36:36] Phoenix and he's knocking for people to
[36:38] let them
[36:41] in to be stand a
[36:45] rainstorm knocking and trying to his own
[36:49] church but that Spirit
[36:53] of has Satan dwell Church
[36:58] dwelling in that church and being
[37:00] worshiped like
[37:02] God causing them to close the door on
[37:06] Christ and he's dwelling within the
[37:11] hearts he's sitting down laying down in
[37:13] our own living
[37:18] rooms making people close the door
[37:21] on what a sad
[37:25] story but there is hope
[37:29] there is one great
[37:32] hope and zecharias 147
[37:36] says that great hope for our
[37:40] day just as brother brandham said a
[37:43] double
[37:44] fulfilling a prophecy for the
[37:47] future a prophecy for our day there
[37:51] shall be a
[37:53] day which shall be known to the Lord
[37:57] not day nor
[37:59] night but it shall come to
[38:02] [Music]
[38:04] pass that the evening time it shall be
[38:07] light that in the evening
[38:10] time there shall be a great
[38:12] light a great messenger a great
[38:16] messenger that will open up our
[38:19] eyes and will take us by the
[38:22] hand and will lead us unto the feet of
[38:24] Jesus
[38:26] Christ in midst of all this religious
[38:29] confusion in the midst of all this
[38:32] darkness of
[38:33] deceitfulness there's still light in the
[38:35] evening
[38:38] time so then in returning into
[38:40] Revelations chapter
[38:43] 3 we can then
[38:47] fulfill not as
[38:49] those but we are the
[38:53] few not the many outside
[38:57] but those that or those that have all
[38:59] those
[39:01] riches those miserable and
[39:04] wretched but we're the
[39:07] few that says in verse
[39:12] 21 to them you that
[39:17] overcometh will I gr sit with me in my
[39:21] throne even as I
[39:25] overcame and I'm sat down with my father
[39:28] in his
[39:30] throne more than
[39:32] Overcomers we're
[39:34] Christians we are like
[39:37] Christ he suffered and
[39:39] overcame and he's sitting in the
[39:43] throne and we ourselves will also be
[39:45] sitting in
[39:47] that we're in that evening time in those
[39:51] last
[39:52] days and there's not much time
[39:55] left we see
[40:01] by Ministries that keep bringing forth
[40:03] more and more
[40:05] Revelation and here we find ourselves in
[40:07] this
[40:08] day and in every day an
[40:13] overcomer but we are a special kind of
[40:17] Overcomers we're an Overcomers that
[40:19] overcame in the darkest
[40:22] age we overcame in the most deceitful
[40:25] age and the hardest
[40:28] age and so then
[40:31] Brothers have that assurance and
[40:34] confidence that you will not be
[40:38] deceived and if it were possible they
[40:40] would deceive the
[40:43] EV but the good news this
[40:46] morning that we will not
[40:50] Beed and we have to tell Satan this
[40:54] morning can't deceive me
[40:57] because I am the
[40:59] elect I'm a part of those
[41:03] few and I identify myself as the bride
[41:05] of
[41:07] Christ Noah preached to the whole
[41:10] world but only a few believed that
[41:15] word Moses delivered many of
[41:20] people but only a few entered into the
[41:24] promis Jesus preached unto multitudes
[41:27] and
[41:30] multitudes but there was only a few that
[41:31] went into the upper
[41:35] room and this message has also went
[41:38] throughout the world time after
[41:42] time but there's only a few that will
[41:44] believe
[41:46] it and there's only a few that will
[41:49] identify with
[41:50] it that it was
[41:53] not God in the
[41:55] man through the
[41:58] man but the Holy Ghost in that
[42:01] man in the days of
[42:04] Noah there was two types of
[42:07] Believers and
[42:09] Enoch he was raptured in the days of
[42:13] Noah and Noah stayed
[42:15] behind so then he had to go through the
[42:20] tribulation but Enoch represented the
[42:22] Bride of Jesus
[42:24] Christ in which I believe that we
[42:26] identify ourselves
[42:29] and Noah represented the
[42:31] church that was going to go through the
[42:34] tribulation but he was also going to
[42:36] make it to the other
[42:37] side he was going to make it to the
[42:39] promised
[42:40] land but I don't want to be like
[42:43] Noah I want to be like
[42:47] Enoch and I'm tired already of the
[42:49] tribulations that I'm going through
[42:50] right
[42:51] now and and I'm already tired of the
[42:53] suffering that I'm going through right
[42:54] now
[42:58] tribulation that I will not be
[43:00] partaking and that's going to be the
[43:02] Great
[43:04] Tribulation because I will be raptured
[43:06] with my Lord Jesus
[43:07] Christ and then in the days of L there
[43:11] was three types of
[43:12] Believers those evil people of Sodom and
[43:16] gomorah which were destroyed left and
[43:20] right the Believers as
[43:23] lot those borderline believers
[43:27] those that put one foot in
[43:30] one that today they believe but then
[43:32] tomorrow they'll
[43:33] backslide I don't want to be like one of
[43:35] those
[43:37] Believers but then then there was also
[43:40] the elect like
[43:43] Abraham those that recognize that God
[43:45] that was
[43:48] incarnated that mzc that brought him
[43:50] forth the
[43:53] message to the
[43:55] Earth that heard that voice
[43:59] that recognized that it was God
[44:01] himself I want to be like one of those
[44:04] elected if you wouldn't mind standing
[44:06] with me we're going to be closing
[44:14] now the scriptures
[44:16] say the musicians can come up
[44:22] now the works that I do you shall do
[44:24] also
[44:27] and greater than these shall you
[44:30] do and if we see the story of the uh of
[44:33] the
[44:35] church after
[44:38] Paul who came to fulfill those
[44:43] scriptures who was doing these great
[44:48] works who was doing the same works that
[44:50] Jesus
[44:53] did no one until a man came will Mariam
[44:57] brandham by the name of William Mariam
[45:01] brandham a man that was so separated
[45:03] from
[45:05] sin a man that was so filled of
[45:09] God he was ordained of
[45:12] God that this very
[45:15] man was doing the exact
[45:18] works of
[45:21] mzc to see and know the intentions of
[45:23] the
[45:25] heart that they had that discern of
[45:28] heart this very
[45:30] [Music]
[45:31] man was doing the works of Jesus Christ
[45:35] The
[45:36] Miracles raising the
[45:38] dead bringing things into
[45:42] existence nothing like this was ever
[45:46] known until this man came to Earth
[45:49] William BR by the name of William Mar
[45:51] and
[45:52] Brenham and he was more than a prophet
[45:57] he was the
[45:59] messenger and in rejecting
[46:02] him is rejecting
[46:05] God and I want us to remember very
[46:10] well that in rejecting a prophet of
[46:15] God is rejecting God
[46:18] himself in the old days and the Old
[46:22] Testament when they would disobey the
[46:25] prophet they were disob oey
[46:28] God when they would go against the
[46:31] prophet they would be going against
[46:36] God and if God is the same yesterday
[46:39] today and
[46:41] forever and God has sent us a
[46:44] prophet with one
[46:47] message and we reject
[46:51] him it's as if we were rejecting
[46:54] God if you wouldn't mind closing your
[46:57] eyes brother Bram
[47:00] says in the
[47:03] message s is this the end
[47:06] time oh
[47:09] God send us a prophet with
[47:14] courage with a thus sayith the
[47:18] Lord that has that Vindicated
[47:22] word that is going to move with it
[47:27] and he's going to be proving that he
[47:28] came from
[47:29] God and when he
[47:33] comes he will out all the
[47:36] ages sure he
[47:41] will he will be against this leodan
[47:44] age surely he
[47:48] will just as he was in every
[47:51] age he won't change in this
[47:54] age he has to do the same
[47:58] brothers and
[48:02] sisters if you
[48:04] [Music]
[48:07] recognized that this
[48:10] messenger is the voice of
[48:13] God it is
[48:15] time that we should consecrate
[48:19] more it's
[48:21] time that we align ourselves once
[48:25] again and we're by
[48:30] coincidence we're here because we've
[48:32] heard the
[48:33] voice Jess just as our brother Jesse
[48:37] said the voice of God
[48:41] said take that television out of our
[48:45] homes and he received the confirmation
[48:47] in the
[48:51] evening which it was spoken of the same
[48:54] he heard of
[48:57] so then he listened to that
[48:59] voice and he took out that
[49:04] television maybe some have that
[49:10] television but we have obeyed the other
[49:12] part of the
[49:16] voice but it is time that we listen to
[49:19] word of
[49:21] God we're all in different
[49:23] stages different levels
[49:27] but the main goal
[49:30] is to reach the statue of a perfect
[49:35] man and that is the reason why he sent
[49:37] us this Angel
[49:39] messenger if you wish you may lift your
[49:42] hands and ask
[49:45] God God help
[49:48] me from this day
[49:52] forward that every word of conviction
[49:54] that comes into my heart
[49:58] that I can apply that to my
[50:00] life and I understand that I'm lacking a
[50:03] [Music]
[50:05] lot but I will take it just one day at a
[50:07] time step by
[50:10] step because I have believed in this uh
[50:14] voice in this last
[50:15] AG will BR of a messenger called William
[50:19] Mariam
[50:20] brandham father help
[50:23] us to be better Christians
[50:27] to be able to get to that
[50:29] great and I ask for my brothers and
[50:32] sisters that you help them and you give
[50:34] them
[50:37] comfort that you strengthen them and
[50:39] strengthen
[50:39] [Music]
[50:41] me so that we may be able to make it to
[50:44] see that
[50:47] day in which we will be transformed in
[50:49] the blinking of an
[50:51] eye in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
