[34:25] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ who
[34:27] place ourselves in your hands
[34:34] for a few minutes
[34:38] I greet you on the precious name of the
[34:41] Lord Jesus Christ
[34:50] it's a great privilege to be here
[34:54] and we thank the Lord once again
[34:58] that these doors are open
[35:02] it's good to be home
[35:05] we were out for about two and a half
[35:08] weeks
[35:12] we went out to the West Coast
[35:15] a La Costa Occidental
[35:18] and it was a great privilege to be out
[35:20] there
[35:24] you know sometimes we get used to being
[35:26] in certain areas
[35:30] and when you you go out to see a
[35:33] different place
[35:39] it's good to see something different
[35:45] sometimes we get used to the same thing
[35:47] over and over
[35:51] and with that we don't appreciate what
[35:54] we have
[35:58] so let's go to go out
[36:03] and get some pressure
[36:05] Fresco and come back
[36:09] when you come back you think wow no
[36:12] place like being at home
[36:17] and when you're home
[36:20] you can't wait to get out
[36:24] so something that man just doesn't get
[36:27] uh
[36:32] we're always looking for something else
[36:36] looking for a new city
[36:40] who's Builder is the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:46] we had the great privilege of visiting
[36:48] the brothers
[36:49] in the lighthouse Tabernacle in San Jose
[36:57] we were there August 31st
[37:02] I told Brother Jose Esparza
[37:07] Esparza we will probably be going by
[37:09] there
[37:12] and I called them when we were there
[37:18] and he had the pastor call me he is
[37:23] [Music]
[37:26] asked me to preach he may be okay
[37:30] well I was able to speak for a little
[37:33] while
[37:35] I'm not sure if they have a picture up
[37:38] there
[37:42] when I was speaking is
[37:47] the one that's next next to me his
[37:50] brothers
[37:56] the next picture
[37:58] is the brothers from San Jose
[38:03] the brother in the turquoise color
[38:10] his name is a brother Hugo Salazar
[38:15] he's a pastor there
[38:18] he was a really nice to us
[38:22] and the brothers that were there
[38:26] some of you might recognize them
[38:31] they went to the meetings
[38:35] and they only had good things to say
[38:37] about the meeting
[38:41] and so they sent the greetings
[38:45] we have Fellowship afterwards and we had
[38:48] a
[38:48] pretty long conversations
[38:54] and from there we drove up to North
[38:56] Oregon
[38:59] Oregon and it's it's a beautiful country
[39:02] over there is
[39:04] if you've never been there it's it's
[39:07] really heavily wooded
[39:12] some giant redwoods
[39:15] enormous and some really nice beaches
[39:21] Stones big old rocks in them
[39:25] just beautiful
[39:27] they have some really big huge Rivers
[39:33] it was a pleasure and
[39:37] it was so nice to be there
[39:42] I want to read to you something real
[39:44] quick
[39:47] today's message is John 3 16.
[39:55] John 3 16.
[39:58] it's a very very common scripture
[40:04] it's so common that we hardly even speak
[40:07] about it is
[40:10] a very important scripture
[40:14] John 3 16.
[40:17] sometimes we get used to the easy
[40:21] verses
[40:25] and we don't use them
[40:27] the thing was too easy everyone knows
[40:30] that scripture
[40:34] those of you that go to football games
[40:38] I'm going to watch the football games
[40:42] you might see people holding up John 3
[40:46] 16.
[40:49] or just holding John 3 3.
[40:53] they're trying to tell you something
[40:55] foreign
[41:18] [Music]
[41:58] all salts coming back
[42:04] and the old sailor that lived in the sea
[42:09] born in the sea and he said my good man
[42:13] we're going south
[42:20] he said sir I'm going down to the sea to
[42:25] be inspired
[42:30] oh I want to smell the salty air you say
[42:38] I want to see the great ocean as it
[42:41] whips up it's big wide bring brainy
[42:45] waves and
[42:48] see the reflection of the sky in its
[42:51] Blue Water
[42:54] is
[43:01] I want to see the scream of the seagulls
[43:07] oh I'm sure I'll Be Inspired when I get
[43:10] to the Sea
[43:12] Village
[43:15] I've longed to see the sea
[43:20] foreign a long to see it all my life
[43:27] I've longed to see the sea
[43:32] and the old salt said to him
[43:35] while I was born in it
[43:39] I've sailed the seven seas
[43:46] nothing inspiring about it
[43:53] he was used to it
[43:57] we have some beautiful mountains out
[43:59] here
[44:01] we have some beautiful Cactus
[44:07] I remember the first time driving up to
[44:10] Phoenix
[44:13] we're looking out the front because we
[44:17] were driving at night I believe
[44:21] we're looking for the first saguaro
[44:24] cactus
[44:27] we're all excited when we saw the first
[44:30] Cactus
[44:35] it was something different for us
[44:38] it was something new to us
[44:41] we're excited by seeing that Cactus
[44:46] there's a lot of other Cactus here
[44:50] it's a beautiful desert out here
[44:54] but yeah we get so used to it
[44:59] that we don't realize that it's there
[45:01] okay
[45:03] and that's the way it is for the people
[45:06] that are out by the ocean yes yes
[45:14] they get used to it
[45:17] they get used to that ocean being there
[45:22] but for us who live in the desert
[45:26] seeing water it's a big thing
[45:31] to hear the waves
[45:34] it's a big thing
[45:36] there's something inspiring Inspira
[45:41] and that's the way the scripture should
[45:43] be for us yes
[45:45] it should be inspiring for us
[45:49] we should love that word
[45:52] but in order to love that word
[45:56] we have to read it
[45:59] John 3 16.
[46:02] a very common verse
[46:06] we can probably just say it out loud
[46:09] without even looking up here in your
[46:10] Bible
[46:13] it comes becomes so common
[46:19] to someone that has not read it it's
[46:26] eternal life is John 3 16.
[46:30] if you will please stand
[46:35] let's read John 3 16.
[46:40] I'm sure and most people know it is
[46:47] when I see the youth outside
[46:51] guess what I'm going to ask you
[46:55] what does it say in John 3 16. it is
[46:59] for God so loved the world
[47:05] that he gave his only begotten son
[47:10] that whosoever believed in him
[47:17] but have everlasting life
[47:21] isn't that great amen
[47:28] the love of God
[47:31] for God so loved the world
[47:34] who's the world
[47:37] everyone
[47:38] for God so loved everyone
[47:49] he gave his only begotten son
[47:53] that whosoever believed in him
[47:59] what must you do
[48:02] what does god require of you to be saved
[48:08] his word
[48:10] you need to believe his words
[48:15] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[48:18] perish
[48:21] but have everlasting life
[48:25] everlasting life how can you obtain
[48:29] everlasting life
[48:32] by believing his word
[48:35] believe in Jesus Christ die for you at
[48:38] Calvary
[48:44] and now you believe him
[48:47] you're baptized
[48:49] you repent of your sins
[48:53] and you start walking
[49:00] at the beginning
[49:03] of a long journey
[49:05] to serve the Lord
[49:09] at the end of the road
[49:12] you've done everything you could
[49:15] foreign
[49:27] [Music]
[49:39] for God sent not his son into the world
[49:42] to condemn the world
[49:48] but that the world through him might be
[49:51] saved
[49:54] for God said not his son into the world
[49:58] to condemn the world
[50:03] but the world through him might be safe
[50:09] you might say well how can I be safe
[50:14] through Jesus Christ
[50:17] there's no other way but through Jesus
[50:20] Christ
[50:23] John 3 18.
[50:25] he that believeth on him is not
[50:29] condemned
[50:33] but
[50:35] he's a Believer not is condemned already
[50:42] but he has not believed because he has
[50:47] not believed in the name of the only
[50:50] begotten son
[50:54] if you don't believe in Jesus Christ
[50:58] you're condemned already
[51:06] if you do not believe or you refused
[51:09] Jesus Christ as your personal savior
[51:12] you're condemned already
[51:18] now listen this is for the Youth right
[51:23] John 5 24
[51:26] John 5 24.
[51:32] merrily merrily I say unto you he that
[51:35] heareth my word and believeth on him
[51:39] that sent me has everlasting life and
[51:43] shall not come into condemnation but is
[51:47] passed from Death unto life
[52:00] verily merely I say unto you he that
[52:04] heareth my words and believeth on him
[52:07] that sent me
[52:09] has everlasting life
[52:16] and shall not come into condemnation but
[52:19] it's passed from death and to life
[52:25] so we're condemned as from the day we
[52:29] are born we're condemned this is
[52:37] and we need a way out
[52:41] and the only way out that we have
[52:44] launica is
[52:46] Jesus Christ
[52:49] without which we are lost
[52:57] the love of God
[53:00] the love of God
[53:03] John 15 12.
[53:07] this is my commandment
[53:10] that ye love one another as I have loved
[53:13] you is
[53:18] you have to love your neighbor
[53:21] greater love has no man than this that a
[53:25] man laid down his life for his friends
[53:28] [Music]
[53:32] Amigos we are my friends if you do
[53:36] whatsoever I command you miss Amigos
[53:43] so you have to follow God's word
[53:48] you are my friends if you do whatever I
[53:51] command you
[53:56] hencefor I call you not servants for the
[54:02] sermons no it's not what his Lord doth
[54:06] but I have called you friends for all
[54:09] things that I have heard of my father I
[54:13] have made known unto you yeah
[54:25] you have not chosen me but I have chosen
[54:29] you
[54:43] your fruits should remain that whosoever
[54:48] ye shall ask of the father in my name
[54:53] he may give it to you it was
[55:01] he shows us
[55:04] by Grace he shows us
[55:07] he's called
[55:09] and by Grace we've listened to his word
[55:16] we have listened to his word
[55:20] and now what shall we do
[55:24] what are we going to do
[55:27] and the message standing in the gap
[55:33] and today
[55:35] he is the only mediator between God and
[55:38] man this is
[55:53] we have been pardoned and forgiven
[55:59] now listen God don't even know we ever
[56:03] sinned
[56:07] our sins were put in the sea of
[56:10] forgetfulness
[56:14] never to be remembered
[56:17] never to be remembered no more
[56:22] we can do not do that ourselves
[56:27] we are finite he is infinito
[56:33] and our finite we can still remember
[56:37] because we're not big enough
[56:44] but he is so great that he even forgets
[56:48] we ever did soon
[56:53] we are sons and daughters in his
[56:57] presence
[57:00] and all things that he was we are
[57:07] he became my sins
[57:11] that I might become his righteousness
[57:17] he become your sins
[57:21] that your you might become his
[57:24] righteousness
[57:28] so God cannot see no sin in you as long
[57:33] as your confession is in Christ foreign
[57:58] let's see what Acts
[58:01] 2 36 says
[58:06] therefore let all the house of Israel
[58:09] know assuredly that God hath made that
[58:12] same Jesus whom ye have crucified for
[58:16] Lord and Christ is
[58:27] now when they heard this they were
[58:29] pricked in the heart
[58:31] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[58:34] the Apostles men and Brethren what shall
[58:37] we do
[58:39] is
[58:44] this is the other scripture that we
[58:47] should know
[58:50] everyone should know this scripture
[58:54] then Peter said unto them repent
[58:58] and be baptized every one of you in the
[59:02] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[59:04] of sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[59:07] the Holy Spirit
[59:17] and the promise is unto you and your
[59:20] children and all that is for all
[59:24] how far off even as many as the Lord Our
[59:27] God shall call says
[59:35] so once you're baptized
[59:39] you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your
[59:42] personal savior
[59:47] you have a mate
[59:51] no no
[59:54] there's a man here
[59:57] that tells the brother Brian helmet
[1:00:00] standing in the Gap
[1:00:04] so if I'm saved
[1:00:07] then I can go do anything I want because
[1:00:09] I'm safe
[1:00:13] you want to see what brother Brian's
[1:00:15] response to that is
[1:00:19] he says that shows you haven't got it
[1:00:25] in the love of God ever struck your
[1:00:28] heart
[1:00:33] tenderness of Jesus Christ
[1:00:37] you will be so in love with him
[1:00:41] the world will be dead as your sins
[1:00:48] that's how you know you have the Holy
[1:00:52] Spirit
[1:00:54] not because you could scream speak
[1:01:02] or in tongues and linguas or whatever it
[1:01:06] is
[1:01:07] but with sin becomes dead
[1:01:13] and you're alive and Jesus Christ
[1:01:17] oh the love of God how rich
[1:01:26] and listen to the story
[1:01:28] I got a couple of stories for you
[1:01:34] now here in Louisville Kentucky not long
[1:01:37] ago a minister was talking that there
[1:01:40] was a young lady
[1:01:42] in Louisville Kentucky
[1:01:47] waited a long
[1:01:49] uh in life to be married
[1:01:54] so somewhere around her 25 30 years old
[1:02:03] and she was a fine start Christian girl
[1:02:07] yeah yeah
[1:02:09] and there was a Christian man in
[1:02:12] Louisville that wasn't yeah
[1:02:17] he hadn't lived such a good life
[1:02:21] yeah run to dances and Road houses and
[1:02:24] so forth
[1:02:28] one day he found pardon for his sins
[1:02:35] and he became a real Christian is
[1:02:42] about a year later he fell in love with
[1:02:45] this young lady and
[1:02:49] young lady madly fell in love with him
[1:02:55] and they were married and after they
[1:02:59] lived together about two years
[1:03:04] they said that this young lady said to
[1:03:07] her husband one day
[1:03:11] she said
[1:03:13] I suppose that's kind of hard for you
[1:03:18] just a Christian
[1:03:21] I've been a Christian since a little
[1:03:23] girl
[1:03:26] but for you a young Christian
[1:03:31] to have to stand all the the wilds and
[1:03:35] temptations that goes with it after you
[1:03:39] you've sinned so long
[1:03:49] and he said well it does become a battle
[1:03:52] yes
[1:03:57] I want you to remember one thing
[1:04:02] that if the enemy does upset you
[1:04:05] somewhere
[1:04:10] and you fall and you go back into sin
[1:04:16] don't stay away from home
[1:04:20] I want you to come home
[1:04:23] so you're going to be you're going to
[1:04:27] find a home
[1:04:29] the same wife that you married
[1:04:36] and said I hope
[1:04:39] or I'll help you to pray back and pray
[1:04:43] through and get back to God again
[1:04:53] said I don't want you to stay away
[1:04:58] look I married you upon the basis not of
[1:05:02] what you were but I marry you because I
[1:05:05] loved you yeah
[1:05:10] [Music]
[1:05:11] which is no matter what you do I still
[1:05:16] love you I married you because I loved
[1:05:19] you uh
[1:05:27] isn't that something
[1:05:31] I think God is like that with us
[1:05:34] is
[1:05:43] we need to come back to church
[1:05:58] if you repent of your sins
[1:06:03] God will forget about them
[1:06:07] maybe your neighbor won't forget
[1:06:10] but the one that counts
[1:06:14] God will forget those sins
[1:06:17] and you can easily go forward
[1:06:25] you fall away
[1:06:28] come back to the Lord
[1:06:31] foreign
[1:06:44] and the man that day went to work
[1:06:48] was her repeating it
[1:06:51] in a in the place where he was working
[1:06:58] he said no how could a man do anything
[1:07:02] wrong against something like that
[1:07:08] correct when a woman that loves him so
[1:07:13] much that no matter what he did was
[1:07:17] willing to come back and thank him again
[1:07:21] and try it again
[1:07:32] see it shows
[1:07:35] now you multiply that by a billion and
[1:07:40] then you have some idea of what the love
[1:07:43] of God is
[1:07:54] I'm lost
[1:07:58] come back to the Lord
[1:08:14] as long as you repentance
[1:08:19] that when a man falls in love with Jesus
[1:08:23] Christ
[1:08:25] the things of the world
[1:08:28] when you think of what he did for you in
[1:08:32] the light of the scripture
[1:08:38] not in the light of some emotion
[1:08:42] but in the light of facts
[1:08:46] what it is
[1:08:48] and then there is something happens in
[1:08:52] you
[1:08:54] when the new birth comes
[1:08:58] the sin is dead as midnight
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:04] when as long as that light is in you
[1:09:10] how can Darkness Shine
[1:09:16] That's What God did to one man who
[1:09:21] thrown himself in the Gap
[1:09:26] that could take the promise
[1:09:30] and Moses being a type of this
[1:09:34] anti-type that's why Moses stood in the
[1:09:37] gap for the people immerses
[1:09:44] Moses stood in the gap for the people
[1:09:50] the love of God
[1:09:53] how immense it is
[1:09:56] how immeasurable
[1:10:00] and we don't appreciate it
[1:10:04] as much as we should
[1:10:07] we start taking it for granted
[1:10:11] we start thinking well God will forgive
[1:10:14] me
[1:10:17] we start taking that for granted
[1:10:22] there's a song
[1:10:24] called the love of God
[1:10:28] it's a tremendous song
[1:10:32] I'll read it to you
[1:10:35] since I can't sing it very good
[1:10:39] the love of God is greater foreign
[1:11:04] bow down with care
[1:11:09] God gave his son to win
[1:11:14] his daring child he reconciled
[1:11:17] reconciliation
[1:11:19] and pardon from his sins
[1:11:23] oh love of God how rich and pure
[1:11:28] Enrique how measureless and strong
[1:11:34] it shall forever more endure Los Angeles
[1:11:40] the Saints and Angels song El cantico de
[1:11:44] los Santos Angeles
[1:11:51] and Earthly Thrones and kingdoms
[1:11:56] fallos
[1:11:58] when men who here refuse to pray
[1:12:05] on rocks and hills and mountains call
[1:12:10] yamaranas

[1:12:15] shall still endure
[1:12:21] all measureless and strong is
[1:12:26] Redeeming Grace to Adam's race
[1:12:32] the Saints and Angels song
[1:12:36] now listen to this
[1:12:39] could we with ink the ocean feels
[1:12:47] and the Skies of parchment made
[1:12:54] where every stock on Earth
[1:12:59] and every man ascribed by train
[1:13:05] to write the love of God above
[1:13:10] would drain the Ocean Drive
[1:13:15] roll contained the hole
[1:13:21] the stretch from sky to the sky okay
[1:13:25] isn't that something I like that last
[1:13:28] one the last stands over there
[1:13:33] let me go over that again I think I'm
[1:13:36] getting late here
[1:13:39] now if we were all
[1:13:46] [Music]
[1:13:51] the whole sky
[1:13:53] was what to write on
[1:13:59] and the ocean was filled with ink yeah
[1:14:04] we will feel the old sky above
[1:14:12] describing the love of God
[1:14:17] describing the love of God
[1:14:20] we can all think about how God has
[1:14:23] helped us
[1:14:26] how God has protected us
[1:14:30] God has blessed us
[1:14:34] so many things God has done for us
[1:14:41] a long time just writing everything that
[1:14:44] God has done
[1:14:48] blessings of God
[1:14:50] we take for granted
[1:14:54] to wake up in the morning is a blessing
[1:14:59] to lay your head at night to sleep yes
[1:15:06] take a breath of air tomorrow
[1:15:10] to be able to see The Wanderers wonders
[1:15:15] things that God has done for us
[1:15:20] so many things that we just take for
[1:15:23] granted
[1:15:37] there's a quote here I want to talk to
[1:15:40] you about the
[1:15:42] that song where brother Brown talks
[1:15:45] about it
[1:15:50] they asked them a question and he uh
[1:15:54] talks about it and at the end he talks
[1:15:56] about this song
[1:16:02] I'll start in line 430 of questions and
[1:16:07] answers on
[1:16:09] Hebrews number 2
[1:16:11] 1957 uh October 2nd comments
[1:16:21] [Music]
[1:16:23] talking about Jesus Christ
[1:16:27] God raised him up and sent him to the
[1:16:31] highest heavens
[1:16:33] and a
[1:16:35] name
[1:16:36] above every name
[1:16:45] why he would have to look over to see
[1:16:49] Heaven foreign
[1:17:01] and the greatest name that ever named in
[1:17:05] heaven and Earth has to be is bound
[1:17:09] around him
[1:17:16] that's what God did to him
[1:17:21] put him the lowest
[1:17:24] and God made him the highest
[1:17:30] there was a there he was from the lowest
[1:17:36] to the highest he became the lowest
[1:17:40] foreign
[1:18:15] he made a way that we can come to
[1:18:18] someday because I live you live also
[1:18:27] oh no wonder when man catch that vision
[1:18:35] there's never been a man could explain
[1:18:39] it
[1:18:42] the women try to explain it losing their
[1:18:46] mind this great song
[1:18:54] Oh the love of God how rich and pure
[1:19:01] how Phantom loose and strong one
[1:19:05] incomprehensively is
[1:19:07] that last verse so I believe the first
[1:19:11] verse it is and we with ink the ocean
[1:19:14] feels
[1:19:20] and where the skies the parchments May
[1:19:23] if foreign
[1:19:40] can never explain the love of God
[1:19:47] oh it can never be told
[1:19:51] what he did for us
[1:19:55] my how could you place one Merit out
[1:19:58] there
[1:20:00] it's his grace
[1:20:02] from beginning to end
[1:20:05] I was lost and undone
[1:20:09] and helpless no good in defense
[1:20:14] nothing about it
[1:20:16] and he by his grace come and saved us
[1:20:26] that is that's my Lord
[1:20:30] that's his love
[1:20:32] that's his goodness
[1:20:36] the love of God Amen
[1:20:40] that song was actually written by a by a
[1:20:45] man named Frederick a m Lehmann is
[1:20:53] the whole song is
[1:20:56] but he only had only written two stanzas
[1:21:02] the last stanza he got it from that
[1:21:06] place we just talked about is
[1:21:12] he wrote that in the early or late 1900s
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:19] but they had found that verse or that
[1:21:28] written in the walls of an insane
[1:21:30] institution just over maybe 300 years
[1:21:33] ago okay foreign
[1:21:42] [Music]
[1:21:59] [Music]
[1:22:03] snap over finger
[1:22:05] she couldn't have anything she wants
[1:22:09] but you know what
[1:22:11] amen she had to accept the Lord
[1:22:15] if she didn't accept the Lord
[1:22:20] then she's somewhere else
[1:22:24] that's up to her
[1:22:27] but I'm just saying that every one of us
[1:22:30] has a decision to make
[1:22:36] no matter how little we are
[1:22:40] how big we are okay
[1:22:43] we're the foreign
[1:23:23] and his name wasn't found
[1:23:27] and he had to go up to the great white
[1:23:31] Throne judgment
[1:23:36] but at the great right Throne judgment
[1:23:39] he found out that he had stalled
[1:23:47] he might have done a few things that
[1:23:49] weren't just quite right foreign
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:23] to be born again

[1:25:37] there's nothing that we can do that we
[1:25:40] can say well I got saved because I did
[1:25:42] this
[1:25:46] but we're saved because you called us
[1:25:52] we have listened to your call

[1:25:59] savior

[1:26:10] but you reached down and picked us up

[1:26:23] to be needs you Lord

[1:26:37] their hands and accept you Lord
