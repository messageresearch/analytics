[4:28] thoughts
[4:30] our hearts today
[4:32] that you would direct us to every word
[4:34] that is necessary for us to know
[4:37] to open our mouths freely and our hearts
[4:40] also to receive
[4:43] and that which you would speak to us and
[4:45] would close our mouths to the things
[4:48] that are not right

[4:52] you can reveal the word of god and now

[10:57] still with us and
[10:59] wonderful
[11:05] brother dao
[11:08] almost left us
[11:10] see we can't say too much or ask too
[11:12] much he's already 21 years have passed
[11:14] the time that god told him to live
[11:16] that's an ordinary lifetime a past the
[11:19] time that god told him he could live but
[11:21] we had a call the other morning that he
[11:24] was he was dying and we rushed up there
[11:26] and the lord god was
[11:29] really good to him and spared him just i
[11:31] think he
[11:32] is ready and
[11:33] just waiting the coming of the lord but
[11:35] you know we all hold on to one another
[11:38] we just the old fellow is like a like a
[11:41] dad to me here i remember him sitting
[11:43] right down here in the old tabernacle
[11:45] the old part
[11:46] when he that light flashed across on
[11:48] that water baptism in the name of jesus
[11:50] christ right out of there he cometh
[11:53] about 87 88 years old on a stick come
[11:56] right up here and said i won't go right
[11:57] in there and be baptized
[11:59] somebody went got him some clothes he
[12:01] couldn't wait till the next time he had
[12:02] come right then right and so i like that
[12:06] instead the other day
[12:08] i was talking to him he said you think
[12:10] i'm
[12:11] all right now brother branham i said did
[12:13] you ever go to a doctor for a physical
[12:14] checkup he said yes sir i said the
[12:17] doctor put stereoscopes in his ears and
[12:19] put them on your heart see if your
[12:21] heart's beating right an electrical
[12:22] cartogram and then blood pressure urine
[12:25] tests and so forth instruments to find
[12:27] out where your physical being now the
[12:29] way he does that he looks back on a book
[12:31] here where specialists on these
[12:33] different subjects writes down if this
[12:35] takes place this is what's wrong and i
[12:38] said
[12:40] now the only steer scope that i have is
[12:42] the bible
[12:44] or the soul
[12:46] i said i'm going to give you the test
[12:49] i said
[12:50] saint john
[12:52] 5 24 said he that heareth my words i
[12:57] said that isn't just sitting listening
[12:58] to it that's receiving it
[13:00] you're seeing it you believe it
[13:02] something inside of you tells you it's
[13:04] right
[13:05] you've accepted it you believe it it's
[13:07] yours he that heareth it's already yours
[13:11] my words and believeth on him that sent
[13:13] me
[13:14] you believe that he said i do i said
[13:16] then i'll tell you what the chief doctor
[13:18] said he's passed from death unto life
[13:21] and shall no more come into condemnation
[13:24] or judgment
[13:25] i said as far as i know according to the
[13:27] books you pass examination
[13:30] that old man of nearly 100 years old not
[13:33] a church man at all
[13:35] but just the first time that light
[13:37] flashed across his path
[13:38] he received it see that predestinated
[13:41] seed laying there
[13:44] see as soon as the light strikes it it
[13:46] comes to life right quick
[13:49] now
[13:50] i know it's hot today
[13:52] and
[13:53] uh it looks like it's hard for me to
[13:55] call you people together for a service
[13:58] where you sit jammed in like this but
[14:00] yet i i thought
[14:02] by the grace of god that i
[14:04] would have another service before i had
[14:07] to leave you on
[14:09] for a short season i trust
[14:12] and i've got to go now tomorrow night uh
[14:16] to chicago
[14:18] to begin wednesday i thought i'd get
[14:20] there a little early if possible and
[14:21] rest up a little
[14:23] before beginning a series of service and
[14:25] i believe they got it here i was looking
[14:27] at it right here
[14:28] it's advertised up there it's called the
[14:32] moringal
[14:35] uh area yeah marigold murray yeah area
[14:39] arena
[14:40] marigold arena it's worth to be helped
[14:43] beginning wednesday night through sunday
[14:45] and the full gospel businessman has a
[14:48] breakfast also on on saturday morning
[14:52] and i don't know just exactly where they
[14:53] got that advertised for
[14:55] um
[14:57] no
[14:58] then saturday evenings at the lean tech
[15:00] i see here it's um
[15:01] every time um now
[15:05] if you're around in that area or up
[15:06] there
[15:07] it's be a regular if it's a regular
[15:09] evangelistic service like we have at any
[15:11] time
[15:12] most of the messages will be primarily
[15:15] on something that's been taught here
[15:16] called shares where we make our tapes
[15:18] you see out there they can fuss but if
[15:19] they get tapes made from here that's up
[15:21] to them if they want to listen to any
[15:22] tape it comes right from here this is
[15:24] our own pulpit so out there usually i'll
[15:27] try to pick around on something not very
[15:29] deep because many of them are shallow
[15:31] and experiencing what comes in but here
[15:33] i feel i have a right to say whatever
[15:35] god puts up on my heart to say it from
[15:37] right here so our tapes are all made
[15:39] from right here
[15:41] and they're right in the room there now
[15:42] you can see their heads up over the
[15:44] cloudy glass in there where they're
[15:46] sitting with their recorders
[15:48] now um if you want to come to the
[15:51] meeting we'd be most happy to have you
[15:53] just if you get there don't know just
[15:55] where to go or just contact any of the
[15:57] full gospel people or
[16:00] brother carlson and he'll he'll tell you
[16:02] that's um
[16:04] you can
[16:05] advise you the philadelphia church or
[16:07] any of them they can tell you right how
[16:08] to get to the place
[16:10] then
[16:11] i'll come back next monday evening
[16:14] sometime
[16:15] afternoon or evening and tuesday we'll
[16:17] go back to arizona
[16:19] for
[16:21] for but the children in school and so
[16:23] forth and then i don't know just exactly
[16:25] when to be back again because
[16:28] uh the lord i want him to leave me just
[16:31] on what to do
[16:32] a very strange thing happened i might as
[16:34] well i know this is taped i might as
[16:36] well place it on here
[16:38] and right while visions and leadings of
[16:41] the holy spirit is moving i like to
[16:43] strike just exactly while it's moving
[16:45] that's
[16:46] now in the last year it's been
[16:49] one uh right along with one of the most
[16:52] highest time for visions that i've ever
[16:54] had
[16:55] in all my ministries been this last year
[16:58] of things that has taken place that you
[17:01] people know that is foretold before it
[17:03] happens and it happened just the way it
[17:04] it said
[17:06] now we come back
[17:08] here and
[17:09] into the
[17:10] visit
[17:11] the climate
[17:12] and this place i certainly don't like
[17:14] because it
[17:16] just breaks me down as soon as i get
[17:18] here
[17:19] and i just i can cross the top of the
[17:21] knobs up there and come down in this
[17:22] valley and i'm here about 10 minutes and
[17:24] i got hives
[17:26] gets sick weather swimming headed
[17:28] everything looks spooky dark and i i
[17:30] just have to get out of it see and the
[17:32] other day i was talking to the wife but
[17:35] what brings me in first what brings me
[17:37] in here is you people okay this church i
[17:40] tell you of all the places i went my
[17:42] life this is my favorite place to come
[17:44] preach the gospel and looks like we can
[17:47] make a tape from here it's ten times
[17:49] better than anywhere else
[17:50] that's the reason i say where god's
[17:52] doing something and stay right with that
[17:55] but i think where the great thing is
[17:57] that's me failing to go out at the first
[17:59] time when he called me and therefore he
[18:01] makes it kind of rough on me when i come
[18:03] in obedience is better than sacrifice
[18:06] and then i'll be coming back and forth
[18:08] all the time preaching in the tabernacle
[18:10] and you people from out of town you'll
[18:12] be notified billy paul will be here
[18:14] right in the office and and be reached
[18:16] at any time through him and we'll be
[18:19] coming back here and then the seven
[18:20] trumpets is coming up right away the
[18:22] lord willing seven last flags and the
[18:24] vials and so forth just as we can get a
[18:26] little cooler weather maybe or something
[18:28] however the lord leads
[18:31] and now
[18:32] the other day
[18:34] coming in uh
[18:35] there was a question brought up about
[18:38] something about someone who had given me
[18:40] a a check
[18:42] and said personally exactly just to me
[18:45] and me only tax paid free everything
[18:48] else
[18:49] well we went and billy knew that uh
[18:51] connie had need of that check now he
[18:54] went and asked the attorneys if we could
[18:56] cash it he said why he's american
[18:57] citizen why can't he cash it see says
[19:00] tax paid and everything else free any
[19:01] citizen can do that
[19:03] so then he couldn't be satisfied with
[19:05] that billy so he goes to the
[19:07] public accountant he said what certainly
[19:10] he can cash that said he's a citizen
[19:12] united states so well he couldn't think
[19:14] good about that so he called merle
[19:16] miller that's the head of the
[19:18] the
[19:19] tax association at
[19:22] indianapolis there was our attorneys
[19:24] and so ice and miller so sure it's all
[19:27] right hey sure he can have that check
[19:29] it's it's uh it's made out to him and
[19:32] dorsey only like only one can endorse it
[19:36] so forth and it couldn't be stamped with
[19:38] rc i don't cash no checks that's what
[19:40] they got before the other time
[19:42] somebody bring in a bunch of checks and
[19:43] say here brother bram at the meeting i'd
[19:44] say william branham william branham well
[19:46] the government's taking care of all that
[19:47] the whole time and i assigned him to
[19:49] myself and he's paying the debts out
[19:50] there but they said i would delinquent
[19:52] taxes on all of it anyhow three hundred
[19:54] thousand dollars
[19:55] so then um that's where the fuss came
[19:58] so then as soon as i put this check in
[20:01] whammy here come the agent right back
[20:03] that will reopen the case for him now
[20:05] and so
[20:06] it made it kind of rough and brother lee
[20:08] vale sitting here i guess it's all right
[20:09] to say it
[20:10] we just he'd come down and
[20:12] this
[20:13] fine scholar baptist year had
[20:16] i baptized him in the name of jesus
[20:18] christ you're in the pool the other day
[20:20] brother levail
[20:22] and so he's really a fine man a brother
[20:25] in christ he's preached for us here
[20:27] before
[20:28] highly intellectually educated and
[20:31] besides that a spirit-led man
[20:34] the light flashed across him he said he
[20:36] tried to get away if it just couldn't do
[20:38] it so i baptized him right here in the
[20:40] morning couldn't stand it any longer so
[20:42] we just come down here put on her
[20:43] clothes when he was baptized in the name
[20:44] of jesus christ
[20:46] well i thought being you've taken that
[20:48] fine spiritual food maybe to talk a
[20:50] little bit we'd take some natural food
[20:51] so he goes over to blueboard sits down
[20:54] was talking and the subject come up how
[20:55] can you let people talk about you like
[20:57] that now brother vale
[20:59] one of the finest man they ever know but
[21:01] just a little too quick on the trigger i
[21:02] always told him you know and so um hey
[21:05] um
[21:06] so i said i hope that's all right
[21:07] brother
[21:09] so uh he's i said don't fly loose all at
[21:11] once sit still god's the ones that are
[21:13] doing it he said i might be all right
[21:16] for you he said
[21:17] he said but well he i believe he is so
[21:21] smart so that's what he's been meeting
[21:22] those smart intellectual people so he
[21:24] just knows how to pour it in there and
[21:25] ain't got no place to stand that's all
[21:28] so i said
[21:29] look brother vail was sitting at the
[21:31] blueboard i said david one day after
[21:33] being throwed from the throne by his own
[21:36] son
[21:38] run off the throne mutiny
[21:41] israel divided
[21:43] and david took off the throne by his own
[21:46] son and was going out of the city
[21:48] weeping
[21:50] and a guy that didn't like his
[21:53] last day message you know he didn't care
[21:55] for him little fella kind of crippled up
[21:58] going along there
[21:59] making fun of him
[22:01] and he spit on david
[22:03] and that's guard drew that sword said
[22:06] i'll let the head of that dog stay on
[22:08] him spit on my king david said
[22:11] let him alone
[22:12] the lord told him to do that
[22:15] spit on him making fun of him and then
[22:17] spit on him so the lord told him to do
[22:19] that
[22:20] well we know the story
[22:22] i return back
[22:24] brother vale thought that took a whole
[22:26] lot of grace to do that
[22:27] so
[22:28] no more coming back and entering the
[22:30] office uh public accountant called billy
[22:32] paul and told him about this
[22:35] so brother vale went up the house with
[22:37] me
[22:38] and i walked in i said to the wife's
[22:40] lawn about
[22:41] sometime in the afternoon
[22:43] we went in a room i said i got something
[22:44] to tell you honey we just been talking
[22:46] four left she said bill i know that god
[22:48] sent you out there we all know that

[22:57] i think it's for you and the children
[22:59] don't matter for me i'm gonna serve him
[23:00] lord willing wherever i go and so
[23:03] walk back and i told her about it like
[23:05] that so i just turned around laid my
[23:08] head up and
[23:09] somebody
[23:10] said something about oh this tax
[23:12] collector who ought to buy just kind of
[23:14] raided out something like that uh not
[23:17] thinking of what i told brother vale i
[23:18] said let him alone
[23:20] maybe the lord told him to do that
[23:22] and no more and said that the light
[23:25] flashed on the wall and rode across
[23:26] there brother vale my wife sitting there
[23:28] come on back to arizona with letters
[23:30] roll across the wall come on back to
[23:32] arizona that's right
[23:34] so here i go
[23:37] and then back to arizona
[23:40] now
[23:41] this week has been a week of great
[23:42] blessings
[23:44] we had private interviews uh this week
[23:47] uh people who have been waiting since
[23:49] the seven seals
[23:51] and i don't doubt but some of them
[23:53] courses called in from out of the town
[23:55] across the nation
[23:57] but uh
[23:58] the morning before the interview started
[24:00] sitting in the room the holy spirit let
[24:02] me write out exactly everything they
[24:06] knew everything they wanted to ask
[24:08] rotate the questions just the way they
[24:09] wanted to and tell them their dreams and
[24:11] interpretation before they ever told me
[24:14] now that people are in the room here
[24:16] there and i go ahead let them talk and
[24:18] say well brother branham i come such and
[24:20] such i said now remember we have symbol
[24:23] here not for fellowship we haven't come
[24:26] here to fellowship with one another
[24:28] there is a question in your mind in your
[24:30] heart that that you stumbled into and
[24:32] you don't know what it is and maybe i'll
[24:35] be able by the help of god to do it i
[24:37] said remember the queen of the south had
[24:40] some questions too when she came to
[24:42] solomon and the bible said there was
[24:44] nothing revealed or held back to what
[24:47] solomon couldn't answer for
[24:49] and i said a greater than solomon is
[24:51] here
[24:52] that's right the lord jesus promised
[24:54] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[24:56] name there i am in the midst of them
[24:59] whatsoever thing they can
[25:02] think of or desire and and shall last it
[25:05] shall be given to them
[25:07] and now your question is something you
[25:09] don't know about
[25:10] something you don't know how to approach
[25:12] about something you don't know what to
[25:13] do about
[25:15] and i said again the scripture said this
[25:17] that
[25:19] the angels of god are encamped about
[25:21] those who fear him so in another world
[25:23] where the five senses does not declare
[25:26] the five senses only
[25:28] contacts this world if you had no
[25:30] feeling you couldn't feel nothing
[25:31] feeling wouldn't be nothing to you that
[25:33] be another world you had no sight
[25:36] what you look at would be another world
[25:37] you know nothing about it
[25:39] so these five senses is the only thing
[25:41] that god let us loose to
[25:43] now there is another one called faith
[25:46] but by faith you walk up a ladder
[25:49] and finally you can get so high until
[25:51] you break into another world which is
[25:53] vision
[25:54] there you can see just like if you never
[25:56] know what this was you was feeling with
[25:58] your sense of feeling never seen it then
[26:00] your eyes come open you can see it
[26:02] it'd be all mystery to that person who
[26:03] never could see it'd be a mystery to him
[26:06] but yet that's it and in there
[26:08] the lord before we got here to people
[26:11] from across the country everywhere
[26:13] from north south west come in for these
[26:16] interviews and as soon as they get
[26:18] through talking just exactly the
[26:20] questions they would ask the thing that
[26:21] they would ask about i'd say watch here
[26:24] raise over and there was a piece of
[26:25] paper with every question and rotate
[26:27] that's exactly the way they asked it was
[26:29] going to ask it their answer down here
[26:31] to their questions and just answer now
[26:33] the lord is great he knows all things
[26:37] but yet take me about three days to come
[26:39] out of that afternoon
[26:40] what it was such a tear down
[26:42] and now i thought to get it oh before we
[26:45] left and there is the proper way the
[26:47] real way
[26:49] of
[26:50] to individuals now these things can be
[26:52] said and if the people share that
[26:54] knowledge that secrets of hearts that
[26:56] was revealed that would absolutely it
[26:59] would be horrible it caused crime
[27:01] because somebody shoot another or
[27:03] something if that be revealed right here
[27:05] at the platform like this in a pub and
[27:07] before the public it would cause
[27:10] penitentiary offenses and everything
[27:12] else that would but when you're setting
[27:14] together like that the holy spirit just
[27:16] too heavy together but we understand
[27:19] this that what they ask me is private i
[27:22] say nothing about it and what i say to
[27:24] them it's up to them where they want to
[27:26] say it or not
[27:27] but it's be no one between us the
[27:29] interview that's taking the person one
[27:31] by time and sitting there until
[27:34] everything is completely settled see the
[27:37] holy spirit and then to think of the
[27:38] grace the holy spirit telling me all
[27:40] about it to each one a whole line of
[27:42] them before they ever even got here
[27:44] across the country coming people i've
[27:45] never seen in life and write it out so
[27:47] if they had no it's a routine according
[27:50] to the questions the way they would
[27:51] answer it one brother had questions on
[27:54] the serpent seed that i didn't get the
[27:56] answer just exactly because her little
[27:58] half hour was up i hope that he got it
[28:01] all right the answers to it on the paper
[28:03] i he had it rolled out and he didn't get
[28:05] to all of his answers so i just gave him
[28:07] the writing back the answers on the
[28:09] paper
[28:10] if he hasn't
[28:11] billy paul has it i know the man sitting
[28:14] here i just looked at him just a few
[28:16] moments ago so if he if he wants to find
[28:19] that it's wrote out on a piece of paper
[28:22] your answers to your question
[28:24] now
[28:25] oh how good the lord is
[28:29] i hope everybody's feeling good
[28:32] and now let's us remember and now when i
[28:34] pray for these anxious to remember
[28:36] brother dao
[28:37] he's a precious brother and we want to
[28:39] remember him in prayer
[28:41] and um i see brother angran but uh i
[28:44] can't see sister angering anywhere
[28:46] whether she's all right now
[28:48] yes setting right out from him sure yeah
[28:51] i'm glad cause was called out the other
[28:53] night in a just an emergency case of her
[28:56] and her daughter sister
[29:00] downey downy uh run off the road and
[29:03] just the grace of god or they've both
[29:05] been crushed to pieces right there and
[29:07] here they come right on the church got
[29:09] on a training come on
[29:10] i'll never forget you all
[29:12] i love you god knows that
[29:15] uh i love you how across the country
[29:18] through slick weather when i look at
[29:20] some brother here from georgia and
[29:21] alabama and different places in
[29:23] tennessee and around where they ride
[29:25] their car down the road where the eyes
[29:27] slide and back and forth like that to
[29:29] come here for one service when i had
[29:32] that emergency called her brother down
[29:33] the other day
[29:35] i didn't realize that lying ohio was so
[29:37] far away yes i thought that's a little
[29:39] skip hop and a jump but my eyelid chair
[29:41] real early that morning never got there
[29:43] to one o'clock that afternoon driving
[29:45] every
[29:46] everything the speed limit would allow
[29:48] and on dual highway and i think how
[29:50] close that is the way down in the south
[29:52] the way these other people come from way
[29:54] out in the north and west where they
[29:56] come i love you and that's the reason i
[29:59] try to be deadly sincere here and the
[30:02] old timers i see brother creech them
[30:04] sitting back there now and ones that's
[30:06] been with me all these years and things
[30:08] and how we come up together i was
[30:10] looking at mary jo's picture i believe
[30:12] it was a couple nights ago just a little
[30:14] bitty tiny thing when we first met now
[30:16] she's married i guess and got children
[30:19] brother cretes and sister creech uh
[30:22] young black-headed and
[30:25] media and i and here we are agree and
[30:27] stooped over
[30:29] see there's something about people like
[30:31] that that
[30:32] it grips you
[30:33] me
[30:34] you you you want to stay with them see
[30:37] there's something other that it always
[30:39] makes your mind pull back
[30:41] just giving them for examples to others
[30:43] that you're
[30:45] young and old
[30:47] we look forward for the coming of the
[30:48] lord so this morning
[30:50] i've
[30:51] put it
[30:52] god i believe put it in my heart
[30:55] to teach a sunday school lesson here

[30:58] god willing
[30:59] for
[31:00] a lengthy time

[31:17] under the holy spirit
[31:19] and he's left her and he
[31:22] believes his messages and teaches it
[31:24] just the same as i do
[31:26] all right and any time
[31:28] you want to you can see fit to come to
[31:31] hear brother neville
[31:33] he certainly
[31:34] would do you good i'm sure
[31:37] the great servant of jesus christ i've
[31:39] known armin neville since i was a little
[31:40] boy and he hasn't changed one spec only
[31:44] got closer to god
[31:45] i remember when i first saw him on a i
[31:47] was invited to his methodist platform
[31:50] and when i come back here at the
[31:52] tabernacle i said someday i'll baptize
[31:54] him in the name of jesus christ
[31:56] and uh here he is with the message now
[31:58] going on a real gallant servant and
[32:01] brother neville goes through many
[32:03] strains and heartaches that he doesn't
[32:05] show it here at the tabernacle but being
[32:07] that the lord lets me have a little
[32:10] sight into people's life i know what he
[32:12] goes through a whole lot of it see and
[32:13] he certainly goes under a lot of
[32:16] labor and strains and things and
[32:18] you people here hold him up like joshua
[32:22] and caleb held up the hands of moses as
[32:24] he's bringing the word
[32:26] love one another above everything

[32:31] don't no matter what the devil tries to
[32:33] say now you're all one great big sweet
[32:35] group now

[32:44] no sir he'll shoot everything if he has
[32:47] bring somebody in to make his target

[32:52] and set him down and cause him to
[32:54] fellowship with you other quietness and
[32:55] things they need to shoot that guy with
[32:58] some kind of poison stuff and he'll
[32:59] start through the church with it don't

[33:19] and you give him respects he'll lead you
[33:21] through
[33:22] and because he's ordained of god to do
[33:24] so

[33:27] the enemy will come
[33:31] and when he does just clean that much
[33:33] closer together

[33:57] tip of my finger i want to stay right
[33:59] there

[34:04] believers to stay right exactly with one

[35:02] the sister say lord don't let me ever
[35:04] have the root of bitterness spring up
[35:05] cause it'll it'll affect him and it'll
[35:07] take the christ right out of my life
[35:10] that poison
[35:11] assets of
[35:12] malice and jealousy and hatred that'll
[35:15] just take the holy spirit right away
[35:16] from you it'll run him from the
[35:17] tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of
[35:20] god or drive it away from here hurt your
[35:22] pastor it'll do everything see don't you
[35:25] do that you just wax that much closer
[35:27] together draw up the take the buckle as
[35:29] a brother testified and minister here

[35:50] by his help and grace i got quite a
[35:53] bunch of questions here

[35:56] and now before we approach it i think i
[35:59] heard the recorders click on in there we
[36:01] are going to
[36:02] bring the message now about god's grace
[36:04] first a word of prayer
[36:06] lord jesus
[36:09] speaking to this body of the church
[36:14] that they should
[36:16] hold together with god's unchanging hand
[36:19] their
[36:20] absolute
[36:22] the word
[36:24] warning them
[36:27] as paul warned his flock
[36:30] that there be wolves enter in
[36:35] you're the same god today as you were
[36:37] then
[36:38] and that enemy is the same
[36:41] may this fellowship and bonds of love
[36:44] always exist amongst these people
[36:47] in christ jesus
[36:49] help this morning lord as we read the
[36:51] word may the holy spirit reveal it to us
[36:55] that the church might be fully
[36:56] established in the faith that was once
[36:59] delivered to the saints
[37:01] to hold them and may as you gave the
[37:04] vision some two years ago to store up
[37:07] the food
[37:09] fine healthy looking
[37:11] vegetables that i saw in the vision
[37:13] being stored here in this tabernacle
[37:16] may we today receive a whole barrel full
[37:19] of that
[37:21] granite lord our tape load
[37:24] that it might reveal jesus christ to us
[37:28] in the hour that we live to give us
[37:30] sustaining
[37:31] strength and spiritual strength for the
[37:34] past that lays ahead
[37:36] granted father bless these thy children
[37:40] they're in here this morning from many
[37:42] different parts of the nation
[37:45] a hot sticky
[37:47] morning
[37:48] but yet we feel the presence of the holy
[37:51] spirit and all this
[37:52] we think of john wesley and calvin and
[37:56] cincy and knox finney and many of those
[37:59] even without electric fan
[38:01] or people set in halls and perspiration
[38:04] running down their faces
[38:07] the women
[38:09] well covered and dressed set in the
[38:11] audiences and perspired till their
[38:14] clothing was soaking wet
[38:16] listening to the word of god feeding
[38:18] their souls
[38:20] now we feel are that they're at rest
[38:22] some worry honor waiting the coming of
[38:25] the lord
[38:28] keep us together father let the holy
[38:31] spirit guide us and direct us give us
[38:33] long life of service for you

[38:42] that it might go to each heart
[38:45] make the lips that speak lord speak
[38:47] truth
[38:49] make the heart that years be fertile to
[38:51] receive truth amen
[38:53] and may it grow into great trees of
[38:56] eternal life
[38:58] to be shining lights and red epistles of

[39:04] christ has raised from the dead
[39:06] and lives among us
[39:08] make us so full of love in the fruit of
[39:11] the spirit until other men and women
[39:13] boys and girls can see the results of
[39:16] the life of christ still living in us
[39:18] after 2 000 years
[39:20] from the great event

[39:25] jesus christ's name amen

[39:31] i want to read some of the scriptures
[39:33] and i trust now that you've got your
[39:35] pencils and papers

[39:38] everything ready

[39:43] just going to take my coat off
[39:47] excuse me for taking off my coat but
[39:49] this
[39:50] this is a
[39:53] awfully warm up here now i want you to
[39:55] return to the book of colossians
[39:59] the first
[40:00] chapter
[40:01] of clothing
[40:03] and then while we read this
[40:05] beginning with i want you when you go
[40:06] home to read the entire chapter of these
[40:09] colossians but i want you
[40:11] to
[40:12] read this morning with me from the 15th
[40:15] verse
[40:16] uh 29th inclusive
[40:19] and now just
[40:20] be as patient as you can
[40:23] or i feel that in this year if god will
[40:26] help me we'll reveal
[40:29] and bring
[40:30] into your mind all these other things
[40:34] that i have talked on
[40:35] all through the days of the tabernacle
[40:38] why i have said what i've said and why i
[40:41] have done what i have done
[40:43] this
[40:44] is why now from the 15th verse
[40:49] who is the image of the invisible god
[40:53] the firstborn of every creature
[40:56] for by him were all things created
[41:00] that are in heaven and that are in the
[41:03] earth visible invisible were they be
[41:06] thrones
[41:07] dominions
[41:08] principalities
[41:10] powers all things were created by him
[41:14] and for him
[41:18] and he is before all things
[41:21] and by him all things consist
[41:26] and he is the head of the body the
[41:29] church who is the beginning
[41:32] the firstborn
[41:34] from the dead
[41:36] that in all things he might have the
[41:39] primitive
[41:41] for it please the father that in him
[41:44] should be all fullness dwell
[41:47] should all fullness dwell
[41:50] let me put a little emphasis on that
[41:52] again this 19th verse
[41:54] for it please the father that in him
[41:57] should all fullness dwell
[42:03] and having made peace through the blood
[42:05] of his cross by him
[42:08] to reconcile all things and to himself
[42:12] by him i say whether they be things in
[42:16] earth or things in heaven watch where
[42:18] that reconciliation went
[42:21] and you that were sometimes alienated
[42:24] and enemies in your mind by wicked works

[43:23] to the dispensation of god which is
[43:26] given to me for you to
[43:29] fulfill the word
[43:31] of god
[43:35] even the mystery
[43:38] which has been hidden
[43:42] from
[43:43] age
[43:44] and from generations
[43:47] but now is made manifest to his saints
[43:51] i want to read that verse again
[43:54] even the mystery
[43:56] which has been hid from ages
[44:00] and from generations
[44:03] but now is made manifest to his saints
[44:06] to whom god would make known
[44:10] what is the riches
[44:12] of the glory of this mystery among the
[44:16] gentiles
[44:17] which
[44:18] is christ in you the hope of glory
[44:22] whom
[44:24] we preach
[44:25] warning every man and teaching every man
[44:29] and all wisdom that we might present
[44:32] every man perfect in christ
[44:35] jesus
[44:37] or unto i also labor striving according
[44:40] to the working which worketh in me
[44:44] mightily
[44:46] now
[44:47] for a text
[44:49] i want to take out of there
[44:52] this for a text
[44:53] basically upon the entire bible
[44:57] but i want to
[44:59] title this
[45:02] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[45:06] christ being the mystery of god reveal
[45:08] now
[45:09] i took it in order as a sunday school
[45:12] lesson so we could all read together
[45:15] and
[45:16] and uh have this fellowship together
[45:20] now
[45:22] god's secret mystery
[45:25] he had before the world began
[45:28] now back in the back part of god's mind
[45:33] there was something that he was trying
[45:36] and was going to achieve
[45:39] and he had a motive
[45:42] and doing it
[45:43] in order to let himself be expressed
[45:47] because first
[45:49] there wasn't even a moon star
[45:52] atom molecule or anything he was god
[45:57] but he exactly wasn't god at that time
[45:59] because god is an object of worship and
[46:02] there wasn't nothing to worship him
[46:04] so in his great
[46:07] mind
[46:08] he wanted these attributes
[46:11] to be expressed
[46:13] in him was love
[46:16] in him was to be father in him was to be
[46:20] son
[46:21] in him was to be a savior in him was to
[46:23] be a healer
[46:25] all these great attributes that we see
[46:27] already expressed they were in god
[46:32] so my opinion the first thing that he
[46:34] made was angels
[46:36] and then they worshipped him and that
[46:38] made him god and he started from there
[46:41] as in previous messages i have tried to
[46:43] explain it
[46:45] break it down
[46:46] and now
[46:47] then when angels begin to worship him
[46:50] that was before there was even a
[46:52] molecule in the earth
[46:55] there was nothing
[46:56] it was all darkness there was no sun
[46:59] there's no moon no stars no nothing
[47:01] then he was god as he asked job where
[47:03] was you when i laid the foundations of
[47:05] the world
[47:06] i think when the morning star sang
[47:08] together the sons of god shouted for joy
[47:12] now
[47:13] where were you see that's way back
[47:15] before the earth now god
[47:18] had a purpose
[47:20] and a hidden mystery
[47:22] and that's what i want to speak on to
[47:24] the church this morning the hidden
[47:26] mystery of god that he had in his mind
[47:29] before the world ever began
[47:32] and how that's unfolded itself right
[47:34] down to this present hour that we're
[47:36] living praise the lord
[47:38] then you will understand clearly that
[47:41] you see on i believe what is being done
[47:45] god's great mystery
[47:48] of how it's a secret he kept it a secret
[47:50] nobody knows nothing about even the
[47:51] angels didn't understand it
[47:54] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[47:56] under our seventh uh
[47:58] uh
[47:59] mystery when the seventh seal was opened
[48:01] there was silence
[48:03] jesus when he was on earth they won't
[48:06] know when he would come he said it's not
[48:08] even the son himself don't know when
[48:10] it's going to happen see god has this
[48:12] all to himself
[48:14] it's a secret
[48:16] that's reason there was silence in
[48:17] heaven for space for a half hour and
[48:19] seven thunders earth their voices and
[48:21] john was even forbidden to write it
[48:24] see the coming of the lord that's one
[48:26] thing he hasn't revealed yet
[48:29] how he will come and when he will come
[48:30] it's a good thing that he doesn't
[48:33] no
[48:34] he has showed
[48:36] or revealed it in every type that's in
[48:39] the bible
[48:41] therefore the entire bible is the
[48:44] revelation of god's mystery in christ
[48:48] the entire bible is an expression of one
[48:52] goal
[48:53] that god had one purpose he wanted to
[48:56] achieve in the entire bible and all the
[48:59] acts of the uh the believers in the
[49:02] bible has been entitled and expressing
[49:05] what god's great goal is and now in this
[49:08] last day he has revealed it and shows it
[49:12] and god's help you'll see it right here
[49:14] this morning what the lord has had in
[49:17] his mind all along and has expressed it
[49:19] therefore you can see the great meaning
[49:22] of what it's been to know this and then
[49:24] try to bring it to the people see and
[49:27] then you don't i haven't went into
[49:29] details to try to explain it as god has
[49:32] revealed it to me
[49:33] now
[49:34] if you want to mark this down i've got
[49:36] so many places i want to read from
[49:38] and now
[49:39] in in the book of saint luke the 24th
[49:42] chapter of saint luke
[49:44] we find out it's
[49:47] it is the two of the apostles on the
[49:49] road to emmaus
[49:51] and jesus
[49:53] stepped out after his resurrection
[49:55] and they were on the road to over to
[49:58] emmaus
[50:00] going along the road thinking and
[50:02] talking and weeping on account of his
[50:05] his
[50:06] death and how they seen him suffer
[50:09] for what they thought was of no
[50:12] value at all they took their lord and
[50:15] crucified him and
[50:16] and they were going along that weeping
[50:18] and he stepped out from the roadside and
[50:21] began to talk to them
[50:23] about christ
[50:25] he said oh
[50:26] fools and slow to understand don't you
[50:30] know that all the prophets and the
[50:32] psalms
[50:33] see what was he doing
[50:35] identifying himself
[50:38] to these apostles that all of the
[50:41] prophets
[50:42] and all of the psalms
[50:45] and everything
[50:46] was him expressed
[50:49] see
[50:51] and now the reason i never talked to
[50:53] preach this morning was because i
[50:55] thought in teaching we would understand
[50:57] it better than just to take a text and
[50:59] skip over we just uh teach it
[51:02] he was saying that all the psalms and
[51:05] all the prophets spoke of him
[51:09] well therefore that shows that all of
[51:11] the old testament all of the new
[51:14] testament and all of the psalms the
[51:17] singing the songs that were sung were
[51:19] sung of him
[51:21] take the 22nd psalm and sing it and
[51:24] compare it with the mourning of the
[51:25] crucifixion see my god my god why has i
[51:28] forsaken me all my bones they stare at
[51:31] me they pierce my feet and my hands yet
[51:34] all those things there them singing that
[51:36] psalm down there in the temple and
[51:37] crucifying the very onesie see those
[51:40] great religious leaders
[51:42] those great man those great teachers
[51:45] and yet so blinded
[51:48] that was reading the prophets
[51:51] and was singing the songs and doing the
[51:54] crime that they said they would do
[51:59] the same thing is taking place this
[52:01] morning
[52:04] now listen close cause
[52:07] i ain't going to even pay attention to
[52:09] what that clock says i want you to get
[52:10] this thing
[52:13] so you can see here basically in the
[52:16] beginning
[52:18] the very thought that god
[52:20] had in his mind he hid it from all of
[52:24] those scholars
[52:26] and the
[52:27] just a number a selected
[52:30] predestinated number a predestinated
[52:33] people was the only ones that heard it
[52:37] i now search back the scripture down
[52:39] through the age of the prophets and see
[52:41] if it wasn't the same thing
[52:44] now and jesus here referring them to the
[52:48] prophets and the psalms he said they all
[52:51] spoke of him
[52:53] see
[52:54] and here these jewish teachers rabbis
[52:57] doctors of the law professors have did
[53:00] exactly like they had done before
[53:03] now notice
[53:04] again he said search the scriptures for
[53:07] they are they that testify me
[53:12] search the scriptures the scriptures the
[53:14] entire scriptures
[53:16] what am i trying to do to show you that
[53:18] this bible is the thing that's right
[53:22] the other day standing in a hospital
[53:23] room
[53:24] talking
[53:25] a sister had asked me to explain about
[53:28] denominations why we was against
[53:30] denominations
[53:32] uh with some denominational people
[53:35] you see it's got to come back to the
[53:37] word because the word is god
[53:42] and jesus declaring the same here that
[53:45] the word is him
[53:48] you can't make the scripture contradict
[53:50] itself
[53:51] in the beginning was the word awards
[53:52] with god and the word was god and the
[53:54] word made flesh amen
[53:58] now
[53:58] here he says search the scriptures
[54:01] they testify me
[54:04] in them you think you have eternal life
[54:06] and that's true
[54:07] and they are the ones that bear record
[54:09] of me
[54:11] and i'm bearing record of them
[54:13] and if i do not the works has promised
[54:15] that i would do then don't hear me
[54:17] but if i do the works and you can't
[54:19] believe me believe the works because
[54:20] they testify
[54:22] that he is the word
[54:24] oh it looks like it couldn't be any
[54:26] plainer
[54:27] thing
[54:29] all right now
[54:31] search the scriptures he said moses and
[54:34] all the laws and so forth and the
[54:36] prophets and psalms spoke of him and
[54:38] again he said the scriptures testify of
[54:40] him
[54:41] he is the principal theme of the entire
[54:44] bible
[54:46] if you read the bible
[54:48] and don't see christ
[54:50] and every verse of it go back and read
[54:52] it again
[54:54] if you can't see christ in every verse
[54:56] of the bible then you read it again
[54:58] because you missed something
[55:00] the bible is christ he is the word
[55:04] when you read in the beginning god
[55:05] created there's christ
[55:07] see
[55:08] every from that to the amen in
[55:10] revelations is every word testifying of
[55:13] jesus christ
[55:14] that's why these added books that are
[55:17] called the second book of daniel in uh
[55:20] the book of the maccabees uh
[55:22] adds purgatory and stuff like that see
[55:24] it's not spoken of in the scripture see
[55:26] it doesn't theme up with the rest of it
[55:28] there's no place to place purgatory in
[55:30] there there's no place to place
[55:32] intersection of saints and things
[55:34] there's no place in there for that
[55:35] there's no place for a denomination
[55:37] there's no place for
[55:38] for creeds outside of the of the bible
[55:42] so when you see those things they just
[55:44] don't come into the picture
[55:46] and that's why people has added those
[55:47] and got their their their jigsaw puzzle
[55:50] all mixed up
[55:51] man they can't make it right same
[55:53] yesterday and forever but if the things
[55:56] put together right there's the entire
[55:57] picture of the fall and regeneration the
[56:02] whole picture of creation god's whole
[56:04] plan revealed right in jesus christ
[56:08] amen that's the whole picture set
[56:11] together every little crooked corner
[56:13] it's just like no
[56:15] i don't mean to be sacrilegious by this
[56:16] but it's just like putting a jigsaw
[56:18] puzzle together
[56:20] that's why we got pictures today it
[56:21] looks horrible
[56:23] say we are believers the cow picking
[56:24] grass up on top of the tree
[56:26] don't work that's when they say yeah
[56:28] he's ever way but just of a certain he's
[56:30] saying yesterday and forever all but a
[56:31] certain thing see then you ruin your
[56:33] picture
[56:34] the bible said he is the same
[56:36] amen saint john 5 or saint john 14 12 he
[56:40] said he he anybody he that believeth on
[56:43] me the works that i do shall he do also
[56:45] well that was for another age there you
[56:47] got your picture wrong again
[56:49] you got a man fishing out in the desert
[56:51] for fish
[56:52] and a bunch of hot sand well there's no
[56:53] fish i had see see you've got to bring
[56:56] him back to where he's fishing at
[56:57] galilee where there's plenty of fish you
[56:59] see
[56:59] you you got to make the picture look
[57:01] right it's god's great picture and
[57:03] there's only one way you'll see it that
[57:04] when you see jesus christ
[57:06] there's the entire bible he's the
[57:08] principal theme of the bible now you
[57:11] realize that any of these places here
[57:13] you could take a text it's just hard for
[57:15] a preacher to hold his peace you look
[57:16] like you want to keep going with it but
[57:18] you've got to get back to what we're
[57:20] teaching on
[57:22] he is the principal theme of the bible
[57:25] he was in the prophets
[57:28] he was in the psalms he was in the
[57:30] history of the bible
[57:32] the bible is a prophetic book
[57:34] it's a historical book it's a book of
[57:37] love it's a book of songs it's a book of
[57:40] life
[57:41] and in there you find christ he was in
[57:44] the prophets
[57:45] he was in the psalms
[57:48] he was in the history
[57:49] and he also in the bible is the things
[57:52] that is to come
[57:55] so he was before and after what does
[57:58] that make him the same yesterday today
[58:00] and forever and you inject something in
[58:03] there that doesn't make him the same
[58:05] yesterday and forever brother lee where
[58:06] do you go to
[58:08] you got an awful picture there
[58:10] for he was the history
[58:12] see and he is the prophet
[58:15] he is the psalms he is everything
[58:18] and if you can't make him everything and
[58:20] the same what's your picture look like
[58:25] do you see it
[58:26] all right he is the thing
[58:28] he was the prophets he was in them he
[58:31] was in the psalms he was in the history
[58:35] and he is the things to come the same
[58:37] yesterday and forever hebrews 13 8 if
[58:39] you're writing it down
[58:41] he should be then
[58:43] he should be the principal if that's
[58:46] what he is and we believe it don't we
[58:48] yes amen
[58:49] then if he is that then he should be the
[58:52] principal theme of our talking
[58:57] of our thinking
[58:59] of our singing
[59:00] of our walks
[59:03] he should be the principal theme of our
[59:05] life
[59:08] if he's the principal theme of the bible
[59:10] and the bible is in us then he should be
[59:12] the principle theme of everything that
[59:13] we do say our thing amen
[59:16] should be christ amen
[59:18] is that right all right
[59:21] since we think this since he's been
[59:24] made the head of all things to us the
[59:27] colossians said so here
[59:28] he's the head of all things to us
[59:32] for he was made
[59:34] for us
[59:35] which we are considered all things
[59:38] he said what about the sinner he was
[59:40] made to be the judge of the sinner
[59:43] if he don't accept it
[59:45] he was made the glory for the believer
[59:47] who does accept it
[59:48] so their thing all things was made by
[59:51] him and for him
[59:53] and it takes the night
[59:55] to express the glory of the day
[59:58] it takes the vessel of dishonor to
[1:00:01] express the the love and care for the
[1:00:03] vessel of the honor
[1:00:06] it takes an evil woman
[1:00:08] that would wear immoral clothes and and
[1:00:11] seller morals to express the virtue of a
[1:00:15] decent genuine lady
[1:00:19] it takes a crook and a thief in a man
[1:00:22] to express the genuineness of a real
[1:00:25] believer a real christian it takes the
[1:00:28] hypocrite to show up the believer
[1:00:31] what he is
[1:00:33] so all things was made by him
[1:00:37] and
[1:00:38] since he was made all thing
[1:00:42] made for all of us all things was made
[1:00:45] far by him
[1:00:47] then
[1:00:48] since that is true
[1:00:50] we should make our identification should
[1:00:53] be
[1:00:54] with him we should be identified
[1:00:57] ourselves with him because he has
[1:01:00] identified himself with us
[1:01:03] we should be identified with him how by
[1:01:07] living for him amen
[1:01:09] not just a confession
[1:01:11] so many people take a confession say i
[1:01:13] say it's got to this place now are you a
[1:01:16] christian i'm methodist
[1:01:19] oh that's a long ways from being making
[1:01:21] yourself known as a christian oh look
[1:01:22] what the methodist does
[1:01:24] i'm baptist
[1:01:26] look what the baptist does
[1:01:27] i'm catholic look what they do see
[1:01:30] but
[1:01:31] the only way that you can actually be a
[1:01:34] christian is for christ to identify
[1:01:37] himself in you
[1:01:40] now we got some a stinger there i hope
[1:01:42] everybody on the tape gets that too
[1:01:45] see
[1:01:46] you say i'm pentecostal that don't mean
[1:01:48] a thing
[1:01:50] it's christ identified in you
[1:01:53] that's when he has recognized you
[1:01:57] so i spoke of tongues devils does too
[1:02:01] i shouted the mohammedans buddhas and
[1:02:03] everything shouts the indians scream at
[1:02:04] the snake dance hey
[1:02:06] there are
[1:02:08] they all do cults clans and everything
[1:02:10] else scream and holly holler and shallow
[1:02:11] the baseball game
[1:02:13] but when christ is identified in you
[1:02:16] identifying himself saying you are
[1:02:18] christ-like which the word christian
[1:02:19] means to be christ-like
