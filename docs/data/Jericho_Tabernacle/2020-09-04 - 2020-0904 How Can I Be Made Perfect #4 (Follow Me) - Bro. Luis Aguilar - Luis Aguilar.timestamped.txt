[35:11] that's what happens when you enter in

[35:28] matthews 5 matteo cinco
[35:31] 38 it's our base scripture that we have
[35:38] um this is this will be our fourth
[35:42] message
[35:53] and as a subtitle to zero in what we're
[35:55] going back to speak on
[36:04] you have heard it have been said an eye
[36:06] for an eye a tooth for a tooth
[36:11] but i say unto you either ye that ye
[36:14] resist not evil but whosoever shall
[36:16] smite thee on the right cheek
[36:17] turn to him the other also no resistance
[36:27] and if any man will sue thee at the law
[36:29] and take away thy coat let him have that
[36:31] cloak also
[36:36] and whosoever saw compel thee to go a
[36:38] mile
[36:54] you have heard that it had been said
[36:55] thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate
[36:57] that enemy
[37:01] but i say unto you love your enemies
[37:04] bless them that curse you do good to
[37:05] them that hate you and pray for them
[37:07] which despitely use you and persecute
[37:08] you
[37:18] that you may be children of your father
[37:20] which is in heaven
[37:22] for he maketh the sun rise on the evil
[37:24] and on the good and send it to rain on
[37:25] the just and on the unjust
[37:26] park
[37:35] for if you love them which love you what
[37:37] reward have ye
[37:38] not even the public cleanse the same
[37:41] question
[37:46] and if you salute your brethren only
[37:48] what do you more than others do not even
[37:50] republicans
[37:57] be therefore perfect even as your father
[38:00] which is in heaven
[38:01] is perfect
[38:16] the lord bless you once again
[38:19] i'd like to thank our pastor as always
[38:25] we're always having that trust he has
[38:26] towards us to stand behind his pulpit
[38:43] the subtitle will be follow me
[38:48] the way i kind of had the guidance for
[38:51] this subtitle
[38:54] last saturday i was leaving work
[39:03] and i was passing i'm going to be honest
[39:05] i was passing his clinic
[39:09] and while i was passing this clinic i
[39:11] passed a 18-wheeler
[39:14] clinic it was a red
[39:17] semi-truck it was a produce truck
[39:24] and once i met that met that checkpoint
[39:29] it said follow me to perfection
[39:37] just help me out understand what you're
[39:39] trying to reveal to me because
[40:04] and we find out that he wants to test
[40:07] what we say
[40:08] and what we believe is true
[40:14] we saw in genesis 22 the first verse
[40:17] in genesis that after all these things
[40:42] and we find out that he wanted to test
[40:45] abraham's heart
[40:50] and the way he wanted the way he tested
[40:52] his heart
[40:54] is when he grabbed his own very own
[40:56] flesh and blood
[40:59] and took him up to the mountain
[41:02] and he wanted to see if he was going to
[41:04] stagger
[41:07] he wanted to see his heart he wanted to
[41:10] see if he was actually going to do it
[41:15] job was tested god allowed him to be
[41:19] tested
[41:22] said he was a perfect upright man
[41:28] he always made offering for his children
[41:46] his own health he wasn't right he wasn't
[41:50] healthy
[41:53] and the scripture tells us that our very
[41:55] own foes
[41:58] and amigos are of our own households
[42:27] your own family members why don't you
[42:30] just stop going to church
[42:33] just stop and curse
[42:36] just stop believing in that prophet
[42:40] just die and curse your god
[42:57] you and the lord taketh away blessed be
[43:00] the name of the lord
[43:03] notice what she was saying from her
[43:06] heart
[43:08] she was speaking from her heart
[43:24] he wasn't like
[44:04] and the moment a trial comes to our life
[44:20] because that
[44:50] because the heart is his dwelling place
[44:55] now if you're looking for a place to
[44:56] dwell
[44:59] looking for a house they're going to
[45:02] test it
[45:04] you're not going to say okay i want that
[45:05] one nobody see the opposite
[45:07] no you're going to look come inside look
[45:10] at the foundation
[45:12] look if it's comfortable look if you see
[45:16] if you can live here
[45:51] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[45:54] faith
[45:58] being rooted
[46:40] and know the love of christ
[46:43] which passage with passage knowledge
[46:48] and we're going to speak about that a
[46:49] little bit that he may be filled with
[46:52] all the fullness of god
[47:22] samuel 16 7.
[47:27] this is the lord talking to samuel this
[47:29] is
[47:31] first samuel 16-7
[47:35] but the lord said unto samuel
[47:48] for the lord see it not as man's
[48:05] now now we see that god never chooses us
[48:07] by our outward appearance
[48:12] man chooses us by our outward appearance
[48:32] firstborn el primo genito big
[48:35] heavy sturdy man was always behind isaac
[48:41] always behind him after his cattle this
[48:45] place
[48:59] so if you were to look to set he's
[49:02] following isaac
[49:04] you would choose esau esco but god
[49:07] didn't choose esau
[49:09] god chose jacob
[49:29] and when samuel came on to jesse
[49:33] he said where are your boys and he said
[49:37] well i got plenty of them
[49:39] i got some big heavy set boys
[49:54] it's a bit of a lengthy quote
[50:10] one time god was going to choose a king
[50:12] to take this
[50:13] take saul's place
[50:19] from backsliding and so he told the
[50:22] prophet
[50:24] who up to jesse's sons i chose one con
[50:28] so jesse said oh that's wonderful
[50:32] he goes out brings a great big tall son
[50:34] seven foot tall elba
[50:37] grande
[50:47] and he said now this man will look
[50:49] beautiful with that crown on his head
[51:07] bring him up here so the prophet said we
[51:10] would just pour
[51:11] oil on him
[51:15] but when he went god said i refused him
[51:20] he brought the next
[51:34] they're the only ones that will look
[51:35] right when the crown on their heads
[51:40] and they're the only ones who are
[51:41] straight enough to walk like a king
[51:47] god said i refuse
[52:06] but i'm sure he wouldn't look good as a
[52:08] king
[52:11] he said go bring him up here let him let
[52:12] me see him
[52:16] as soon as little old david with a
[52:18] little sheepskin coat on
[52:20] it
[52:26] a little slingshot in his hands walking
[52:29] along
[52:30] coming
[52:44] that was on the inside of him
[52:48] man looks on the outside
[52:52] god looks on the heart
[52:55] now see that's the reason why he tests
[52:57] us
[53:40] which means feelings
[53:54] because that's his dwelling place
[53:57] he wants us to be 100 sure that we love
[53:59] him
[54:02] rooted and grounded in love
[54:06] and the message this jesus christ the
[54:08] same yesterday and forever
[54:10] jesus christ 1961
[54:14] in the garden of eden satan
[54:17] chose the part of man satan
[54:21] his head his
[54:40] your faith will make you believe things
[54:42] that your mind knows nothing about
[54:44] suffering
[54:49] you cast down reasoning
[56:00] it goes against all of that because the
[56:03] sixth sense
[56:05] was given to us the children of abraham
[56:09] what abraham said i have it
[56:13] but i can't touch it
[56:26] one day my daddy will come out of the
[56:27] streets one day um
[56:42] you
[57:08] satan can't understand
[58:20] that he took away his children took away
[58:23] his cattle
[58:25] but he restored his cattle
[58:28] he restored his riches that he didn't
[58:31] give him more sons
[58:33] but his sons were up in glory
[58:36] does the lord give and take away he's
[58:39] not an indian girl
[58:42] he doesn't give you the holy ghost
[58:45] and then take it away from you amen
[58:48] amen now he doesn't just save you now
[58:52] and then he would just forget about your
[58:53] 20 years down the road
[58:57] no he gives it to you and you're always
[59:00] going to have it
[59:02] you're always
[59:17] that's why he said blessed be the name
[59:18] of the lord
[59:21] now we can't have the word in our minds
[59:27] we can't have it there no we have to
[59:30] have it in our hearts
[59:32] now this book all right if it's in your
[59:35] mind
[59:36] that's going to be a rule book to you
[59:40] it's going to be a rulebook do this
[59:43] do this
[1:00:40] experience like abraham did yeah
[1:00:44] but my lord my lord
[1:00:47] loves it me my lord loves it it pleases
[1:00:51] him
[1:00:53] when i raise up my hands and pleases the
[1:00:57] lord
[1:00:58] when i wear my skirts when you get
[1:01:02] married
[1:01:03] you're going to understand that you do
[1:01:06] it to please your wife
[1:01:50] i can't
[1:02:04] you want to see where your neighbor's
[1:02:05] heart is quiet
[1:02:07] let them talk let them talk
[1:02:11] are you going to speak from the heart
[1:02:15] hey man i'm going to stop myself a
[1:02:17] little bit more
[1:02:27] very familiar scripture that we've all
[1:02:29] read and heard and
[1:02:31] before estonia family
[1:02:38] [Music]
[1:02:40] now this young man is the hobbin he had
[1:02:43] a question in his heart
[1:02:46] don't you have questions i have a lot of
[1:02:49] questions
[1:02:51] this young man had a question in his
[1:02:53] heart
[1:02:56] and he said well what can i where can i
[1:02:58] go
[1:02:59] to get this answer
[1:03:14] where do you go even you older people
[1:03:19] where do you go where do you have a
[1:03:22] question
[1:03:24] do you go to your friend to this young
[1:03:27] man did he go to his buddy
[1:03:32] he went to his neighbor no he went to
[1:03:34] the good master
[1:03:38] so where do you go he this young man
[1:03:41] went to the world
[1:03:57] many of the times when our friends and
[1:03:59] our family comes to us
[1:04:04] sometimes we give them the wrong advice
[1:04:08] because we love them so much
[1:04:25] and it goes with our relatives but when
[1:04:28] you go to the words
[1:04:32] the word isn't going to see it it's
[1:04:34] going to hurt your feelings or not
[1:04:38] the word
[1:04:51] [Music]
[1:05:01] don't you know that we have a pastor
[1:05:06] it's very quiet in here being called
[1:05:08] it's very quiet
[1:05:10] we have a pastor and a prophet
[1:05:16] is young folk figures in covenants you
